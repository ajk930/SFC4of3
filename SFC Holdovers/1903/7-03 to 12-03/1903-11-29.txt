In some such dismal grlndings of the

heirloom sword, and after telling Tomas
and the other blacks for thelr.own safety
to keep an alarm guard waking through
the night had sallied forth upon my er
rand to the dear lad, plunging directly
into the virgin forest, the better to avoid
encounter with scouting parties of Sir
Falconnet. who I made no doubt would
leave no stone unturned to run me again
to earth. - But scarce had I traversed a
mile into the gathering darkness than
heart-rending cries of anguish . coming
faintly from the direction' of the lodge
that I left hold mo affrighted in my
tracks and a flaring glare of fire, that
mounted higher and ever higher toward
the heavens e'en while I stood and lis

rather, that the Ireton. blood is linked up
with that thing we call a conscience, a
heritage from those simple-hearted an
cestors to whom, the suicide was a soul
accurstâ a soul Impenitent, whose very
outer husk of flesh and bones they used
to bury at the crossing, of the ways, with
a sharpened stake to pinion' it.
'Twas this ancestral conscience made
me cowardly and when the sight , of iny
father's sword â Darius had rescued and
restored it to its place upon t the chimney
breastâw>uld set. me thinking of "the
Israelitish King, and how, when all, was
lost, he fell upon hls-blade and died, this
horror of the suicide -came to give me
pause.
Besides,, that way to right the double
wrong was not so clear as it might seem.
As matters stood, my living for. the pres

she became my widow and my heir-at
law, the mercenary Baronet would play

a widow, he'd keep his passion decently

It was thus that each fresh scanning
of thÂ«* prison wall that shut me in this
dungeon of dishonor fetched me once and
again to this one sally-port of death. And
when it came to this, that I had searched
In vain for other outlet, you will not
think it strange that I sat down in spirit
at this postern to see If I might open it
with my own hands.
It was not love of life that made me
hesitate. At two-score years he who
has lived at all has lived his -best: and If
he live beyond the turning point of youth
ful ardor he must beg the grace of
younger men to linger yet a little longer
on the stage which once was his and
now Is theirs. , v
There was no hope of other outlet. Now
there was space to view it calmly. I saw
how foolish was the thought that Mar
gery would connive at any breaking ot,
the marriasre bond. She would bear my
name and hate me for the giving of it;
would go on hating me. I thought, to" all
eternity; but she would never take her
freedom back again, save at a dead man's
hand?.
When all was done I flung myself upon
the couch of panther-skins, hoping
against hope that sleep might come to
help me through the hours of waiting.
'Twas a vain hope. There was 'never a
wink df fonretfulness for me In all the
long watches of the summer day, and I
must lie wide-eyed and haggard, think
ing night would never come and making
sure that fate had never before walled
a man in such a dungeon of despair/
There was no loophole of escape with
hono-. The heavens were* brass, with all
the horizons narrowed to a bounding wall
to hem me in on every side. There was
no sally-port in all this wall save oneâ
the one that death had promised to open
at the dawn. The promise had been
broken. True, death had thni3t the key
within the lock, and I had heard the
grating of the bolts: and yet the key' had
been withdrawn and I was left a prisoner

There was no hint of soldier discipline,
and they might have been. !ecderless for
aught I saw cf deference to thfir cap

the captain out by any sign, since all

though they made no military show, they
lacked neither hardihood nor courage, of
a certain persevering sort.

them, a grizzled borderer. lank, lean and

out with explications.

would not say themselves.

and never mentioned Margery's part ' in

fair-fought battles of the soldier sort.

"Damn him aa you please. Dick," and
he'll warrant It But you infest, not Judge
the lady over harshly, nor always by ap

a boyish lover, and yet I thinkâ"
I stopped Jn sheer bewilderment, shot
through and through with keenest agonies
of remorseful recollection. For at tho
moment I had clean forgot the gulf im
passable I had set between these two. Bo
I would have lapsed Into shamed silence,
but Jennifer would not suffer it.
| VWell, what Is it that you thlnkf he
demanded.
"I think-nay, I may say I know that
she thinks well of you, Dick." I blun
dered on, seeing no way to put him oft
I He gripped my hand, and in his eyes
there was the light of the old love re
awakening.
"Don't^ lift ma up to fling' me down
again. -Jack! How can you know what
she thinks of me?" he broke in, eagerly.
I should have told him then all there
was to tell. He had been" thrice my
savior, and his heart was soft and malle
able in the side of friendship. I knew it
âknew that the pregnant moment for full
confession had arrived; and yet. I could
not force my tongue to shape the words.
Indeed. I saw more clearly than before
.ttiat "never any word of -mine could make
him understand that I was not a faith
less? .traitor In " Intention. So I paltered
.with' the truth, like any wretched coward
of them all.
"You forget that -I have come . to know
her well " I said. " "I was a month or
more under the same roof with her, and
In that tirne she told me many things."
Now, this witless speech was no better
than a whip to flog him on.
. "What things?" he questioned, prompt
ly- ' , '. ' â¢
"Oh, many things. She spoke often of
you."
â¢'What did she say of me, Jack? Tell
me. what she said." he besged. "It can
make no difference now; she. is less than
nothing to me â nay. 'tis even wor3e than
that, since she would play Delilah if she
could. But oh. Jack, I love her:â I should
love her if I stood on the gallows and she
stood by to spring the drop and turn
me off!" "
Truly, if the lash of remorse had lacked
its keenest thong, this passionate out
burst of his would i have added it. None
the less. I must needs be weaker than
water and fall back another step and put
him off.
"Another time, Richard. I am strangely
unnerved and dizzy-headed now. By and
by, when I am stronger, I will tell you
a!l."
When I was left alone- 1 had no plan
that reached beyond thv tf^y's end. S.sx-j
to go to Jennifer House by daylight
would be to run my neck afresh into the
noose. I saw notion? for it but to He in
biding till nightfall. The hiding p!ac;
that promised best was tho o!d bunt'n?
Ir.dge in the forest, and thitherward I
turned my face.
At this I was brought down to some
consideration of tho present and. its ; de
mands. As fortune's wheel had twirled.
I had mv life, to be sure; but by the
having of it was made the basest traitor
to my friendâ to Jennifer, and no whit
lers to Margc-ry.
'Twas out of any thought that I should
take the field againFt the common enemy,
leavlns this tangled web of mystery and
misery behind. In sheerest .decency -,' I
owcil it f.rst to Jennifer to make a swift
and frar.k confession of the Ill-concluded
tale of harmenlngs. That done, I owed it
equally to him and Marsery to find soai^
way to :-f-t aÂ«lde the midnight marriage.
So I fe!I backyuror. my wound for an
excuse," tellir.s the capt^ln^that. I was not
yet fit to take the fieldâ which was true
ennus-h. Whereupon h^-.anfl his men' set
me well beyond the Cahger of immediate
pursuit and we parted jcompanx-.
"We'll dodge the redcoats, never you
fear; we're at our best in that." he re
joined, carelessly. "And aa to the Chero
kee UDstlrring, that's an old slory. The
King's men have tried it twice and the/
have not yet caught Jack Sevier or Jim
mle Robertson a-napplng. Ease your
mind on that score, Captain Ireton. and
come alon? with us, if you have nothing
better to do. I can promise you hard liv
ing and hard fighting enough to keep ;it
In countenance."
"I know this Uncanoola," I said. "My
father befriended him' in the plague of
'60. and was never sorry for it. as I be
lieve." Then I would ask if these Ca
tawbas had ranged themselves on tha pa
triot side, a question which led the young
militia captain to give me the news at
large, while his borderers were breaking
camp and making their hasty prepara
tions for the day's march.
"'Tis liberty or death with us now;
we've burnt our br.jgres behind us." he
said, when he had confirmed the tidings
I had had the day before from Father
Matthleu. "And since here in Carolina
we have to fight each man agatnst his
neighbor, 'tis like tc go hard with us,
lacking help frÂ»m the North."
"You have your work cut out to dodge
the British light-horse. Captain Forney,"
said I; capping the venture by telling him
what little I knew of Tarleton's disposi
tions, and also of the Indian-arming plot
I had overheard.
ert, Dlague-stricken and deserted by all
his tribesmen, he had saved his life and
earned an Indian friendship.
I did lie quiet, but sleep came not, nor
did I woo it. â For long past the time
when I could hear his measured breath-
Ing, I lay awake to plan how I might
draw the Baronet's man-hunt to myself,
and so free my loyal Richard of the peril
that by rights was mine.
I fell back on the bearskins to shut
my eyes and call up all the might of love
grapple, with this fresh misery. It was
in this fierce conflict of faith against ap
parent fact that I descried the parting
of the ways for the lover and the hus
band.
Jennifer believed this most incredible
thing, and yet he loved herâ would go
on, loving her. as he had said, in spite of
all. That was the lover's road, and I
could never bear him company on it.
Could I believe her so pitiless cruel a*
this, I made sure no husband-love could
live beyond that moment of conviction.
But at this perilous pass the husband's
road ran truer than the lover's. Richard
believed her capable of this hard-hearted
thing and went on loving her blindly In
spite of it. But as for me. I said I would
never give belief an inch of standing
room: that had I stood in Ephralm
Yeates' shoes, having the witness of my
own eyes and ears, I would still have
found excuse and exculpation for her.
I stole a glance at Jennifer. He was
Bitting with his face in his hands, a silent
figure of a strong man humbled. He had
called her a Delilah, and the green withes
of her binding cut sore into the flesh.
"You say you love her. Dick; can you
believe her capable of this and yet go
on loving her?" I asked.
He let me see his face. It was haggard
and grief-marred.
"I'd pay the devil*3 owÂ» price could I
?*y 'no' to that. Jack. But I cannot."
"Then I swear I love her better than
you do. Richard Jennifer. She hates me
wellâ God know3 she has good cause to
hate me fiercely, yet I would trust her
with my life."
I looked to see him pin me down at this:
and though the words had fairly shaped
and said themselves, I laid fast hold of
my courage and was prepared to make
them good. But he would only smile and
draw the bearskin cover over me. tucking
me as tenderly as a mother, and saying
very gently:
"So she has bewitched you. too; and
now there are two poor fool3 of love in
stead of one. But you are stranger than I.
Jack. You will break the spell and put
it down and live beyond it. and that I
never shall â God help me!" And with
that he went to his own bed beside the
fire, telling me I must lie quiet and try to
sleep.
"Nay," he objected soberly, "that would
be my quarrel, were there ever a peg to
hang * quarrel on. But it came by a
sure hand and one that La friendly enough
to all concerned. An old free borderer.
Ephraim Yeates by name, brought ma
the tale. He had been spying round at
Appleby Hundred, wan tine to know, for
some purpose of his own, why the red
coats and Cherokees were hanging on so
long; and this much he overheard one
night when he was outlying under the
window of the withdrawing-room. He
says she was in a pretty passion at the
Baronet's slackness, stamping- her foot
at him and lashing him with.' the taunt
that he wa3 afeard of one or both of us."
" 'Tls this same Madge Stair you have
been defending. Jack." he said bitterly.
"It eeerns that Falconnet mads sure we
had both gone to join the army, which
was but natural. If she were less than
the spiteful little Tory vixen that she is.
sbe would have been content to let It
rest so. But sho would not let it rest so.
With her own lips she assured Falconnot
he still had us to reckon with; nay, more
âshe made a boast of It that we would
never eo so far away from her."
Weak and fever-shaken as I was, I yet
made shift to get upon my elbow feebly
fierce, denouncing it hotly for a lie.
"Who slandered her like this. Dick*
Put a name to the cur. and as I live and
get my strength again. I'll hunt him
down and choke him with that lie!"
I said I bad no right to ask more than
he chose to tell, and at this he blurted
out an~ oath and let me have the sharp
edged truth. â¢
"Falconnet has an ally whoso wit is
shrewder than his. Can you guess who
It is?"
"No."
But on the aide of love and friendship
no woman ever had a truer heart, a
keener, eye or a Ifghter band. And In a
service for friend or mistress he wouM
spend himself as recklessly as those old
knights you read about who made a busi
ness of their chivalry.
With his dally offerings of unselfishness
to shame me. you may be sure that I waa
flayed alive, self-flossed like a miserable
monk, with all the woundlngs of the whip
well salted by remorse. As you have
guessed, I had not yet summoned up the
courage to tell him how I had staked his
chance of happiness upon a casting: of the
die of fate â staked and lost It. Now thai
it. was gone, I saw how I had missed the
golden opportunity: how I had weakly
hesitated when delay could only make
the telling harder.
By tacit consent we never spoke of
Margery- Richard's silence hear upon
despair. I thought: and as for mine, since
the husband's road and the lover's lay so
far apart. I could not bring myself to
speak of her. But she was always first
In my thoughts In that time of convales
cence, r.3 I made sure she was In his. and
at the last the hidden thing between us
was brought to light.
It was on a night some three weeks or
more after my fever turn. Our larder
had run low again, and Jennifer had
spent the earlier hours of the night
abroadâ to little â¢ purpose, as It chanced.
'Twas midnight or thereabouts whan he
came swearing In to tell me thai tha
Tories were out again to harry ear aide
of the river afresh, and' to make a refu-

MASTER OF
APPLEBY.
Sunday Call Literary Section"Open! Mr. Stajr; open!" he shouted,
between the batterings, but it was five
full minutes before the fan-light over
head began to show some faint glimmer
ings of a candle coming from the rooms
beyond. fV.*.:.
Richard .rested at that, and in the pause
a thin voice shrilled from within.
"Be off, you runagates! Off, I say! or I
flre upon ye through the door!"
Giving no heed to the threat, Dick set
up his clamor again, calling out hla name
and bidding the old man open to a friend.
In some notching of the hubbub. I heard
the unmistakable click of a gun-flint on
steeL There was barely time to trip my
reckless batterer and to fall .flat with him
on the door-stone when a g\in went oft
within, and a handful of slugs, breaching
the oaken panel at the. height of a man's
middle, went screeching over us.
Before I knew what he would be at,
Richard was up with an oath, backing off
to hurl himself, shoulder on, against the
door. It gave with a splintering crash,
letting him In headlong. I followed less
hastily. It was as black as a setter's
mouth within, the gun fire having snuffed
Jennifer outran me to the door by half
a length and fell to hammering fiercely
on the panel with the pommel of his
broadsword. ->
With that he faced about and ran. and
forgetting to loose his grip on my arm,
took me with him till I broke away to
have my sword hand free. So running,
we came presently to the open space be
fore the house, and, truly, it was well
for us that the place was clean deserted;
for by this we had both forgot the very
name of prudence.
As near as might be guessed. It wanted
yet an hour or two of daybreak when
we made a landing within the boundaries
of Appleby Hundred, and beached and hid
the pirogue in the bushes.
Thinking the approaches from the road
and river would be better guarded than
that from the wood, we skirted a wide
spread thicket tangle, spared by my
father twenty years before to be a grouse
and pheasant cover, and fetching a com
pass of half a mile or more across, the
maize fields, came in among the oaks and
â¢ hickories of the manor grounds.
Still there was no sight nor sound of
any enemy; no light of candles at the
house, or of camp-fires beneath the trees.
A little way within the grove, where the
interlacing tree-tops made the darkness
like Egyptian night, Jennifer went on all
fours to feel around as if in search of
something on the sward. Whereat I
.called softly to know what he would be
at
He rose, muttering, half as to himself:
"I thought I'd. never be so far out of
reckoning." Then to me: "A few hours
since, the Cherokees were encamped just
here. You are standing in the ashes of
their fire."
"So?" said L "Then they have gone?"
"Gone from this safely enough, to ba
sure. They have been gone some hours;
the cinders are cold and dew weL"
"So much the better." I would say,
thinking only that now there would be
the fewer enejnies to fight.
He dipt my arm suddenly, putting the
value of an oath into his gripping of It.
"Come awake, man: this Is no time to
be a-daze!" His 'whisper was a sharp
behest, with a shake of the gripped arm
for emphasis. "If the Indians are gone.
It moans that the powder train has coma
and gone, too."
"Well?" said I.
I was still thinking, with less than a
clod's wit. that this would send the Baro
net captain abo^st his master's business,
and so Margery would have 6uccase to
him for a time, at least. But Jennifer
fetched me awake with another whip-lash
word or two.
"Jack! has the night's work gone to
your Jiead? If Falconnet has got his
marching orders you may be sure he's
tried by hook or crook to play 'safe bind,
safe find." with Madge. By heaven 1 'twas
that she was feared of and we are here
too late! Come on!"

THE SOUTH.

CHAPTER XIX.
HOW A STUMBLING HORSD
, BROUGHT TIDINGS.
Having a definite thing to do we set
about it forthwith, taking to v the fields
and making a wide circuit around the
manor house and the quarters where the
blacks were already stirring to come out
to the river and so to cross In our canoe.
, Not ) to take a certain hazard for the
sake of better speed, we shunned the
road, and for the first hour or so were not
greatly hindered by keeping to the forest
path.
It was in the densest underwood, when
we could hear ; the purring of a stream
ahead, that Jennifer finally stopped sud
denly and began to sniff the air.
"Smoke," he said Â¦ briefly in answer ' to
my query. "A camp flre. with meat
abroll. Never. tell me you can't smell It."
I I said I could notâ did not. at all events.
, - "Then you are not as sharp, set for
breakfast as I am. Call up your wood
craft'and; we'll stalk it." And, suiting
the action! to the word, he dropped noise
lessly on hanas and knees to inch his way
cautiously out: of the thicket.
,1 followed at his heels, marveling at his
skill in threading, the maze with. never a
snapped twig to betray him. , For though
I have called him a youthling, he came of
great, square-shouldered , English stock
and; was well upon fourteen stone for
weight. Yet upon \ occasion, as now, he
could be as lithe and cat-like as an Indian,
. "Madge, . d'ye say,?^ She's gone; gone
where neither you' nor that dour-faced
deevil'that'befooled us all will - find her
soon.; I promise you.': Dlekle'/ Jennifer!"
he snapped; and I gave them my* back
and stumbled blindly to the door, mak
ing sure his next word, would : tell my
poor wronged lad all that he should have
learned from never i any â¢ other, lips ; ,but
mine own. But Richard himself parried
the Impending stroke of truth, saying:
Whereupon Richard loosed his neckcloth
to give him better breathing space. ':
"Yes, they're gone â all gone, curse. 'em,
and they've taken every plack and baw
bee they could lay their thieving hands
upon," he mumbled presently." " 'Tls like
the dogs, to stay on here and eat and
drink me out of house and home, and then
to scurry off when I'm most like to need
protection." - ' ,
"But Madge?" says Richard, f Is she
safe In bed?" 'â¢ ,
"She's a Jade!" was all the answer he
got. Then the old man sat up and peered
around the end of the. settle to where. I
stood. I saw ha did hot recognize me,
and was well enough content to let It rest
thus. ' ; . . .;Â¦ " : -: :â¢ ; 'â¢Â¦' Â¦ ' T '>-
the old man's candle out But ire had
flint and steel and tinder-box, and when
the punk was alight, Jennifer found the
candle under foot and gave it me. It took
fire with a fizzing like a rocket fuse, and
was well blackened with gunpowder,
When the flint had failed to bring tho y
firing pcark, the old man had set his piece '
off with the candle flame. . '
We found him in the nook made by the
turn of tho stair, flung thither, as it
seemed, by the recoil of the great bell-
mouthed blunderbuss which he was still
clutching. The fall had partly stunned
him, but he was alive enough toprotest
feebly that he would take a dozen oaths
upon his loyalty to the cause; that he had
mistook us for some thieving marauders
of the other side; craftily leaving cause :
and party without a name till he should
have his cue from us.
"So she is safe and well, Mr. Stair,'tis
all I ask to know."
"She is safe enough; safer by far than
you are at this minute, my young cock
a-hoop rebel, now that" the KingâGod
save him! âhas*his own again."
- I turned quickly on the broad door
stone to look within,
"How is that you say, Mr. Stair?" says
Dick. "The King âbut that is only the
old Tory fcry. There will never be a
King again this side of the water."
The old man 1 reached'out and hooked
a lean finger-in the lad's: buttonhole,
"Say you so, Richard Jennifer? Then
you will never have heard the glorious
news?" This with a leer.that might have
been of triumph or the mere whetting of
gossip eagernessâI could not tell,
"No," says Richard, with much Indif
ference.
"Hear it. then.' .'Twas at Camden, four
days since. "They came together in the
murk of. the Wednesday morning, my
Lord . Cornwallls.i and 'that poor fool
Gates. De Kalb is dead; your blethering
Irishman, Rutherford, is captured; and
your, rag-tag rebel' army j is scattered to
the four winds. And' that's not all. On
the : Friday, . Colonel Tarleton came up
with Sumter at Fishing Creek and caught
him napping. , Whereupon, Charlie Mc-
Dowell , and the over mountain j men, j see

Jack of them - for himself. So ye see, .
Dickie . Jennifer, there's never a cursecij
corporal's guard â¢ left In" either Carolina
to stand in the King's way."
He rattled all ; this off glibly, . like , a
child' repeating some lesson got by heart;
Â¦but when-Iiwouldhave found a grain of
comfort In the hope that it was a farra
go of Falconnet' a lies. Jennifer made the
truth appear,- In answer to a curt ques
tion.
" 'Tis . beyond doubtâ all this. Mr.
StairrV: .; . ... ..:. , â¢';Â¦; :?'Â¦Â¦Â£{.-'.
:. The old loyalistâ loyalist now, if never
certainly beforeâ sat down* on' the settle
"Nay, nay; that you shall not. Dick,"
I began, but he was half way through
the narrow passage to the open, trailing
the ancient broadsword and the bearskin
from his bed: and I was fain to follow
quickly, leaving the protest all unfinished.
"What is it. Jack?" he asked, gently.
"My sword!" I gasped. "We should
have been half-way there by this. Yeate3
was misled. 'Ti3 Falconnet she fears.
She was at bayâ hark you, at bay and
fair desperate. That word of hers to the
Baronet was her poor pitiful defiance built
on .her trust In us, and we have lain
here-" *
He found the sword and thrust it into
my hand, crying:
"Come on! You can Ptrew tha dust
and ashes on mÂ« later. You said you
loved her the better, and I do believe It
now. Jack! You trusted her, as I did not
We'll fight as one man to cut her out
of this coll, whatever It may be: and
after that Is done I'll make my bow and
leave you a fair field."
"Francis FÂ«lconnet was under the same
roof with her â or at least In easy callâ
when ehe wrote that. Jack. He is no
longer my rivalâ nor yours."
Ills word set me thinking, and I would
fall to picking out the strands that Jeal
ous wrath had woven for me Into the web
of happenings. Setting aside the story
brought by Kphraim Yeates, there was
no certain proof that she had ever fa
vored the Englishman; nay, more, till I
had come to be madly jealous of Falcon
net, I had made sure that Jennifer was
the favored one.
At this, as one sees a landscape struck
out clear and vivid by the lightning's
flash. 1 saw the true meaning of the word
the hunter had broughtâ saw it and went
upon my knees to grope blindly' for the
sword I had let fall when Dick had found
thÂ«Â» arrow.
"Now God have mercy on us both!" I
groaned. "Forgive me. Dick, if you can;
I was as mad as any Bedlamite. If I
have any claim on her, 'tis not of her
good will, you may be sure. You have
the Baronet to fearâ not me."
He shook his head and pointed to the
parchment- to the line In French.
This brought me to my senses at a
gallop, as you would guess; to them and
to the lighting of the conscience flra with
in whereon to grill the wicked heart that
but now, had thirsted for a brother!*
blood.
space; two men "with every tie to knit
us close together, and yetâ God save us
all!â a pair of wild beasts strung up to
the killing pitch because, forsooth, we
must needs front each other across a
deadline drawn by the finger of a. woman!
God knows what would have come of
all this had my dear lad been as fierce a
fool as L 'Twas his good common sense
that saved us both, I think, for when the
savage rival madness was at its height
he turned away, swearing, wa were the
very cick and choice of a world of asses
to stand thus feeling, for each other's
throats when, mayhap, the lady needed
both of us.
"And that word will beâ '?"
"That she loves another man. Come,
let us be at it; we should be well out of
this before the plantation people are
astir.". : . â¢ :r- v^?:^
He saw my meaning; that I would stand
aside and let him be her succor If she
needed help. But he would not have lt'so.
"No," he said, doggedly. "We'll go to
gether, and she shall choose between us
for a champion if she Is in the humor to
honor either of us. That is what 'twill
come to In the end, and I warn you fairly,
John Ireton, I shall neither give nor take
advantage in this strife. I said last night
that I would stand aside, but that I can
notânot till she herself says the killing
word with her own lips."
I hesitated. "I see no great risk in all
this, and whatever the hazard, 'tis less
f or Â¦ one than for two. You'd best go
alone, Richard."
His answer was prompt and to the
point! "To press on afoot through the
forest till we come to the York settle
ment; then to borrow a pair of Tory
horses and ride like gentlemen. Are you
game for It?"
"A dyed-in-the-wool Tory family seated
some ten miles across the line in York
district. Â«True,Â» 'tis a rank Tory hotbed
over there-and we shall run some risk."
"Never name risk to me if you love me,
Richard Jennifer!" I broke in. "What 13
your plan?"
"God knows how much or little she
has had to say about it," said he. "But
I mean ! to know, too, before I put my
name on any company roll." We were
among the trees by this, moving off for
safety's sake, since the day was coming;
and he broke off short to wheel and face
me as one who would throttle a growling
cur before It has a chance to bite. "We
know the worst of each other now, Jack,
and we must stand to our compact. Let
us see her safe beyond peradventure of a
doubt; then I'm with you to fight the
redcoats single-handed. If you like I
know what you will sayâ that the coun
try calls us now more than ever; but
there must needs be some little rallying
interval after all this disaster, and "
"Have done. Richard," said I. "Set the
pace and mayhap I can keep step with
you. What do you propose?"
"This, that we go to Witherby Hall and
get speech with Mistress Madge, if so
beâ"
"Stay a moment. Who are these With
erbys?" . .
Â¦ "There will be plenty of fighting yet.
and we must go bear a hand where it is
needed most." said I. "Where will that
be, think you? At Charlotte?"
He looked at me reproadhfully.
"This time 'tis you who are the lag
gard In love,- John Ireton. Will you go
and leave Mistress Margery wanting an
answer to her poor little cry for help?"
I shrugged. "What would you? Has
she not taken her affair Into her own
hands?" /
"It seems we have missed our cue on

"At Camden, you mean? That's but

He shook his head despondently. "You

I ~ called to mind the resolute little
handful under Captain Abram Forney,

would not yield the point.

"Damme! yes; bag, baggage, serving

Richard Joined me on the door-stone.
The dawn was in its twilight now, and
the great trees on the lawn were taking
gray and ghostly shapes In the dim per

Uncanoola held up all the fingers of one
hand and two of the othor. "Sebben In

I looked at Richard and he gave me
back the eyeshot with a hearty curse to

"Falconnet!" said he, by way of tail

" 'Twas that there same hoss captain,

Yeates. "Maybe one o' you two can tell
what-all he nought be a-drivtns at."
Jennifer shook his head, and I. too, was
silent. 'Twas out of all reason to suppose
that the Baronet would resort to sheer
violence and make a terrified- captive of
the woman he wanted to m3rry. It was a
curious mystery, and the hunter's next
word Involved It still more.

the record of the onfall as Yeates and
the Catawba did. But for all the over
lapping tangle of mocassin, and hoof
prints neither of these men of the forest
was at fault, though ten minutes later
even their skill must have been baffled.
Inasmuch as the first few spitting rain
drops were pattering In the tree-tops
when we came upon the ground.
"That's Jest about what I was most
afeard of." said the borderer, with a
hasty glance skyward. "Down on your
hunkers, chief, and help me read this
sign afore the good Lord takes to send
ing rain on the jest and the onjest," and
therewith these two fell to quartering all
the ground like trained dogs nosing, for a
scent.
In spite of this delay It was yet early
In the forenoon of that memorable Sun
day, the 20th of August, when we set our
faces southward and took up tha line of
march to the ford of the ambushment.
By now the sky was wholly overcast and
the wind was blowing fresher in the tree
tops, but though as yet the storm held off
the air was the cooler for the threatened
rain, and this was truly a- blessing, since
the old hunter put us keen upon our met
tle to keep pace with him.
We marched Indian file, Ephraim
Yeates in the lead, Uncanoola at his heels
and the two of us heavier-footed ones
bringing up the rear. Knowing thu
wooded wilderness by length and breadth,
the old man held on through thick and
thin, straight as an arrow to the mark;
and so we had never a sight of the road
again till we came out upon it suddenly at
the ford of violence.
this: the party of homing revelers had
been ambushed and waylaid at the ford
ing of a creek some miles to the south
ward and In the melee the young mistress
and her .tire-woman had been captured.
So far as any actual witness of the eye
went. the negro had seen nothing. Thera
had been a volley tire from the thlckat
belly of black darkness, a swarming at
tack to a chorus of Indian yells, shouts
from the men, shrieks from the women,
confusion worse confounded in which the
newsbearer himself had been unhorsed
and trodden under foot. After which he
knew no more till some oneâ his master,
as he thoughtâ kicked him alive and bads
him mount and ride post-haato on the
backward track to Appleby Hundred,
crying the news as he went that Mistress
Margaret Stair and her moid had been
kidnaped by the Indians.
Pinned to the mark and questioned
afresh, the slava could not affirm of his
own knowledge that any one had been
killed outright. Pinned again. It proved
to be only a guess of his that the one
who had given him his orders was his
master. In the darkness and confusioa
he could make sure of nothing; had made
sure of nothing save hla own frenzy of
terror and the wording of the messag* he
carried. 'â¢
When we had quizzed him empty we
hoisted him upon his beast and sent him
once more a-gallop on the road to Ap
pleby Hundred. That done & hurried
council of war was held In which we
four fell apart, three against one. Jenni
fer was for Instant pursuit afoot and at
top speed, and Ephraim Yeates and the
Catawba. abandoning their own emprise
apparently without a second . thought,
sided indifferently with hfâ¢ For my
part, I was for going back to prepare in
decent order for a campaign which
should promise somothlng more hopeful
than the probability of speedy exhaus
tion, starvation and failure.
For all the good It did I might have
spared my pains and saved by breath.
Jennifer broke me in the midst, crying
cut that I was even now killing the pre
cious minutes, and so our ill-starred ven
ture had Its launching in the frenzied
haste that seldom makes for. speed. One
small concession I wrung out of his Im
patienceâthis with the help of Yeates and
the Catawba. We went back to the
breakfast camp, rekindled the flre and
cooked what we could keep and carry of
the venison.
Pruned down to the simple statement
of the fact and with all the foolish terror
chatterlngs weeded out, his news came tr>

principal fact of the carrying* off of Mia

1 said I was fit enough and would do
whatever he thought best. And then I
took a steo upon the forbidden ground.
"Falconnet Is still at Appleby Hun
dred?" I said.
He nodded.
"And you will Join the army at the
front and leave Margery to his tender
mercies?"
Ills laugh was bitter. 6O bitter that I
scarce knew it for Richard Jennifer's.
"Mistress Margery Stair is well, and
well content, as I told you once before.
She has no wish for you or me, unless it
Le to see us well hanged."
"Nay. Richard; you Judga her over
harslily. I fear you do not love- her as
her lover ehould."
"Say you so? Listen: To-night I got
as far as the manor house, being fool
enough to risk my neck for another eight
of her. God helD me. Jack! I had it.
They have scraped together all the Tory
riff-raff this side of the riverâ Falconnet
and the othersâ and are holding high
revel at Appleby. Since it is still our
true-blue borderland, they are scant
enough of women of their own kidney,
and I saw Madge dancing like any light
o* love with every Jackanapes that
offered."
"In her father's house she could not
well do less," I averred, cut to the heart,
aÂ» he was, and yet without his younger
lover's Jealousy to -make me unjust.
"Or more." he added, savagely. " "Tis
aÂ» I say; rhe lacks nothing we can give
her and we'd as well be off about our
business."
I think he never had It in his heart to
leave her in any threat of danger. But
from his point of view there was no dan
ger threatcnfr.s her save that which she
wfmH willing enough to rush uponâ a
life of titled misery as Lady Faleonnet.
I saw liow he would r.ee It; saw. too. that
his Â»a? the saner summing of it up. And
yet-
He br<-ike into my musings with a point
ed question. "Whet pay you. Jack? 'Tls
but a little whiffet of a Tory jade who
cares not the snap of her finger for either
of uÂ«s. The night Is fine and dark. Shall
we float the canoe and give them all the
slU>?"
Thin was how it came to turn upon a
"!'Â¦â¢<" or "no" of mine. I hesitated. I
know not why. In the little pause the flre
burned low between us and the shadows
deepened In the burrow cavern until they
strangled the eye as mephitic vapors
Fcant a man of breath. The silence, too,
was stifling. There was no sound to
breach it save the jrurglinpr murmur of
the river, and this was subdued and In
termittent like the death-rattle in the
throat of the dying.
I've always made a scoff of superstition,
and yet. my dears, a thousand questions
in this life of ours must hang answerless
to the crack of doom If you deny It stand
ing-room. I knew no more than I have
set down here of Margery's besetment:
nay. I had every reason Richard Jennifer
had to believe that she was well and well
content, lacking nothinp. cave, mayhap,
the freedom to marry where she chose.
And yet. out of the stifling silence there
came a sudden cry for help; a cry voice
less to the outward ear, but sharp and
piercing to that liner Inward sense; a cry
fo real that I would start and listen,
marveling that Jennifer made no sign of
having heard It.
In the harkening instant there was a
faint twang like the thrumming of a dis
tant ham string, and then the grave-like
silence was rent smartly by the whistling
hiss of an arrow, the 6haft passing evenly
between us and scattering the handful of
fire where it struck.
Jennifer came alive with a start, leap
ing up with a malediction between his
teeth upon our dallying.
"Too late, by God:" he. cried. They've
trapped us like a pair of blind moles!"
And with that he caught up the ancient
broadsword, only to swear again when
he found no room to swing it In.
Havinrr the handier weapon, I slipped
out before him. creeping on hands and
kr.ees till I could see the leafy screen at
the den's mouth, and the shimmering re
flection of the stars upon the water be
yond it. There wa? no sight nor sound of
any enemy and the canoe lay safe as
Jennifer had left It.
To make assurance sure, I would have
scrambled to the bank above, but at the
moment Jennifer hallo>e<l softly to me,
and so I crept back Into the burrow.
"See here." he said excitedly. "What a
devil will vou make of this?"
He had drawn the scattered embers to
pethe-r, fanning them ablaze again, and
had sought and found the arrow. It was
a blunt-head reed and no war shaft. And
around the middle of It. tightly wrapped
and tied with rilken threads, was a little
ccroll of parchment.
*' 'Tls the Catawba's arrow," said Jen
nifer, though how he knew I could not
pues:-: and then he cut the threads to free
the scroll.
Unrolled and rpread at large, the parch
ment proved to be that map of Captain
Stuart's that I had found and lost again.
And on the margin of it was my note to
Jennifer, written In that trying moment
when the bribed sentry waited at the door
end my sweet lady stood trembling beside
rne. murmuring her "Holy Marys."
"Read it." said I. "It explains itself.
Tarleton had Laid me by the heels to wait
for the hansrman. and I would have
passed the word about the Indian-arming
on to you. But my messenger was over
hauled, and â "
"Yes. yes." he broke 5n; "I've spelled It
out. Rut this line added at the bottomâ
eurely. that Is never your crabbed fist.
By heaven! 'tis In Madge's hand!"
He knelt to hold It closer to the flicker-
Ing fircliarht. and we deciphered it to
gether. It was but a line, as he had said,
with neither .greeting nor leave-taking,
address nor sijnature.
"If this should come Into the hands
of any true-hearted gentleman" â here
was Â» blot as if the pen had slipped from
the fingers holding it; and then. In
French., the very wording of the Inarticu
late cry that had come to me out of the
darkness and silence: "A mol! pour
1'amour de Dieu!"
We fell apart, each to his own side of
the handful of embers.
"You make it out?" said I, after a mo
ment of strained El!enc#.
He nodded. "She has prattled the par
lez-vous to me ever since we were boy
and maid together."
A full minute more of the threatening
ellence. a.nd at the end of It we were
glaring at each other like two wild crea
tures crouching for the spring.
It v.-as Jennifer who spoke first. " 'Twas
meant for me," he said: and his voice had
the warning of a mastiffs growl in it.
"No!" said I. curtly.
"I say it was!"
"Then you say the thing which Is not"
Had I been Richard Jennifer, I know
not what bitter reproach I should have
found to hurl at the man who had thrice
owed his life to me. But he said no word
tif what had gone before.
"You may give me the lie. If you like,
John Ireton. I shall not strike you." He
tsS6 it slowly, but his face was gray
with anger. Then he added, hotly: "You
know well that word was meant for me!" (
At thisâ God forgive me!â my jealous
wrath broke bounds and I cursed him for
t beardless coxcomb who must needs
think he stood alone in the eye of every
rom&n he should meet. "She needs a
man!" I raged., lost now to every sense
of decent Justice, "a man, I say! And to
whom would fhe send If not to herâ"
I choked upon the word. He had risen
with rat. and we stood face to face In
that grim earth-womb, snarling fiercely
It each other across the narrow firellt
. We picked the black up and soused
him in the stream till- he found his
tongue; and the first wagging of â¢ that
useful member gave us news to flre the
blood in our veins â In Jennifer's and
mlne^at any rate.
The old man, cut another slice of the
venison and took his time to Impale It
on the forked toasting stick. . '
"Well, then I says to the chief, here,
says I. 'Chief, this here's our A-number
one chance to spile the 'Gyptlans; get
heap gun. heap powder, heap lead, heap
scalp.' The chief, he says, 'Wah!' â which
Is good Injun talk for anything ye likeâ
and so here we are, hot-foot on the trail
o' that there hoss-captaln and his pow
der varmints."
"Alone?" said I, in sheer amazement
at the brazen effrontery, of this chase of
half a hundred well armed men by two.
' The old hunter chuckled his dry little
laugh. "We ain't slch tarnation big fools
ez.we look, Cap'n John. There's a good
plenty of 'em to wallop us, ez I'll allow,
if it come" to fighting 'em fair and square.
But there'll be some dark night 'r other
whenst we can slip up on 'em and raise
a scalp f r two and lift what plunder we
can tote: hey, chief?"
But now Richard would inquire what
time in the night the powder convoy left
Appleby Hundred, and if Gilbert Stair's
York district guests had, traveled with
it. To these askings Yeates made an
swer that Falconnet and his troop, with
the Cherokee contingent, had taken the
road at midnight, or thereabouts: and
that the Witherbys, with Mistress Mar
gery riding her own black mare, and her
maid on a pillion behind a negro groom,
had passed some two hours later.
This was as we had hoped It might be;
but when Dick's satisfaction would have
set Itself in word3, the old hunter made
a sudden sign for silence and quickly
flung himself full length to lay his ear
to the ground. Whereat we all began
likewise to listen, but I. for one. heard
nothing till Yeates said: "A hoss; a
taking the back track like old Jehu the
son of Nimshi was a-givlng him the whip
and spur," and then we all marked -the
distant drumming of hoofbeats.
The old borderer sprang afoot, kicked
the flre into the stream, and caught up
his rifle. "Let's be a-moving." he said.
"We must make out to stop that there
hoss-galloper at the ford and find out
what-all he's a rip-snorting that-away
for."
The road crossing of the stream was
but a little way above our breakfast
camp; and we were out of the thicket in
time to see the horseman, a negro cling
ing with locked arms to the neck of his
mount, come tearing down to the ford.
At sight of us. or else because he would
not take. the water at full speed.- the

him. -:TT&&&te&Â£&B&WE9BBBS&BSttKA

â¢ In: due time , our creeping progress
' brought us out of the thicket on the brink
of the higher creek bank. Just here the
stream ran in a shallow ravine with shelv
ing, banks of clay, and on its hither mar-
Kin was a bit of grassy intervale biff
enough for a horse .to roll upon. Though
it was sadly out of season the carcass of
a deer, fresh killed, hung upon a branch
of the nearest tree, with a rifle leaning
against the trunk as if to guard It. in
the middle of the bit of sward a tiny camp
fire burned, and at the flre. squat t ng
with their backs to us and each toasting
a cut of the deer's meat on a forked
stick, were two men.
One of these men would pass by cour
tesy as a white. His hunting shlr f. an Â°
leggings were of deerskin, well S*â¢?Â«
and greasy, with leather fringes at the
>eams of leg and sleeve. For all the sum
mer heat he wore a cap fashioned of rac
coon skin with the fur on: and for this
great cap his iron-gray hair, matted and
unkempt, served as a fringe to keep the
other* tassellngs* In countenance. ina
hunting shirt was belted at the waist and
in the ben was thrust a sheathless knife
huge enough to serve a butcher's PUW*-
From two leather thongs crossed upon
his shoulders hung the Powder-horn ana

and rifle, summed up his accouterments
The other was a red man and his attire
was simpler.. Like all our southern In
dians, he went naked to the waist, but
the savage's love <>f ornament showed
forth in the fringe of colored porcupine
quills on his leggings and in bis raven
hair bestuck with feathers. For arms ne

It went within a trembling halr's

was the Quicker Richard's life would
have paid the penalty of his sup.

his hand between stone and steel, ana
the flint bit. harmless for Jennifer. Into
the palm of the Indian.
"Wah!" he ejaculated, in his soft gut
tural. "No want kill Captain Jennir.
hey?"
Ephraim Teates lowered, his T r - # Â» pon .
and released the pinched hand held last
by the gun-flint.
"Well, I'm daddled. fair and square.

Dick laughed and called to me to fol
low, as I could. And his answer to the
old borderer was no answer at all.
"'Tls to be hoped you and the chief
don't mean to be nldderlng with that
deer's meat. We were guessing but a
half-hour back. Captain Ireton and I,
whether or no we'd have to take up belt
slack for our breakfast."
At the word the Catawba whipped out
his knife and fell to work hospitably on
the meat supply.
While we ate, Richard apoke freely of
our intendings; and in return Ephraim
Yeates was able to confirm Mr. Gilbert
Stair's war news to the letter. For all
his Tory bias and prejudice, it seemed
that Margery's father had spoken by the
book. Gates' army was crushed and
scattered to the four winds; Thomas
Sumtera free-lances had been attacked,
worsted and driven, with the leader him
self so sorely wounded that he was car
ried from the field in a blanket slung
between the horses of two of his men;
and. rs was to be expected, the Tories
were up and arming In all the north
country. Truly, thÂ« prospect was most
gloomy and the outlook for the patriot
cause was to the full as desperate as
King George himself could wish.
"But you, Ephraim, and the chief,
here; are you two running away like all
the others?" Richard would ask.
The old hunter growled his denial be
tween the mouthfuls of scarce-warmed
meat. "I reckon ez how 'tis t'other way
'round; we're sort o* camping on the red
coats' trail, ez I allow. Ain't we, chief.
heyT*
The- Catawba's assent was a guttural
"Wah!" and Ephraim Teates went on to
explain.
"Ye see, 'tis this-away. Tou took a

the altar o" Baal. Hunker down and He
clost; if there's any dying to be done,
ye've got a good half o" the night ahead
of ye, and there's all o* to-morrow that
ain't teched yet."
It takes a pitiless avalanche of words
to spread these interlinear doings out for
you; but you are \o conceive that the
pause is mine and not the action's. While
the old man was yet pulling us down,
my fearless little lady had drawn back
a pace and was giving the villain his
answer.
"I am glad I know you now for what
you are. Captain Falconnet." she said,
coldly. And then: "You can take me
with you. If you choose, having uha
brute strength to make good so much
of your threat. But that Is all. You
cannot take for yourself what I have
given to another."
"Cannot, you say?" He clapped his
hat on smartly and whistled^ for his
horse-holder; and when the man was
gone to fetch the mounts for the wom
en. Wo finished out the sentence. "Lis
ten, you. in your turn. Mistress Spitfire.
I shall take what I list, and before you
see your father's house again, you'll beg
die* on your knees, as other women have,
to marry you for very shame's sake!"
It was then that Uncanoola did the
skillfulest bit of Jugglery it has ever
been my lot to witness. Posturing like
one of those old Grecian discus-throwers,
he sent his scalping knife handle fore
most to glide snake-like through the
grass to stop at Margery's feet. Though
I think she knew not how It got there,
she saw it, and the courage of the sight
helped her to say, quickly:
"When it comes to that, sir, I shall
know how to keep faith with honor."
His laugh was the harshest mockery
of mirth. "You will keep faith with me,
dear lady; do you hear? Otherwiseâ"
He turned to take the black mare from
his man. At this my brave one set her
foot upon the weapon In the grass.
"I have no faith to keep with you.
Captain Falconnet." she said.
He struck back viciously. "Then, by
heaven, you'd best make the occasion. It
has happened, ere this, that a lady aa
dainty as you are has become a play
thing for an Indian camp. It lies with
me to save you from that, my mistress."
She stooped to gather her skirts for
mounting and in the act secured and
hid the knife.* So her answer had In It
the fine steadfastness of one who may
make desperate terms with death for
honor's sake.
ing, glance, around that minded me of
some poor hunted thing* hopelessly en
meshed In the net. of the fowler, she
clasped, her hands and. wrung them,
breaking down; plteously at the last, and
begging him by all that men hold sacred
to send her and her maid back to her
father, If only with a single soldier tor
a guard.
'Twas then we . had to drag; my dear
lad down and bold him fast, else he had
flung himself Into the torrent In some
mad endeavor to spend his life for her.
So I know not In what false phrase the
Baronet refused her, but when I looked
again she was no longer pleading as his
suppliant; .she was standing before him
in the martyr steadfastness of a true,
clean-hearted woman at bay.
"Then you will not "by so much undo
the wrong you have done me, Captain
Falconnet?" she said. .
"A wrong? How then; do you call It a
wrong to rescue you from these brutal
savages. Mistress Margery?"
She took a step nearer, and though the
dry-stick blaze was ' dying down and I
could no 'longer see her face distinctly.
I knew well how the scornful eyes were
whipping him.
"Listen!" she said. "When you set
Tallachama and his braves upon us In
the road that night, you were not cau
tious enough. Captain Falconnet. I saw
and heard you. More than that. Talla
chama and the others have spoken freely
of your plans In their own tongue, not
knowing that my poor Jeanne had been
three years a captive among the Telli
quos," â¢ ' ,. Â»
The attack was so sudden-sharp and
so completely a surprise that he was ta
ken off his guard, else I made sure he
would not at such a time have dropped
the gentlemanly mask to stand forth the
confessed ravlsher.
"So ho? Then you have been playing
fast and loose with me as you did with
the handsome young planter and that
beggarly captain of Austrians? 'Twas a
bold game, ma petite, but you have lost
and I have won. for my game was still
bolder than yours. What I need. I take.
Mistress Madge, be it the body of a
woman or the life of a man. Savez-vous
un homme desespere, ma cherle? I am
that man. You pique me. and I need the
dowry you will bring. If I could have
killed your lover out of hand I might
have been content to leave you for a
time. Since I could not. you go where I
go; and when we return I shall do you
the honor to make you Lady Falconnet!"
The effect of this fierce tirade, poured
out In a torrent of hot words, was less
marked upon his helpless captive than
it was upon her four would-be de
fenders. It moved us variously,
each .' after his kind; nevertheless.
I think the same thought lighted
instantly upon each of us. Though we
might not reach and rescue here, her
sharpest peril would be blunted upon
the quieting of this fiend-in-chief.
So Ephralm Yeates stretched himself
face downward in the damp grass and
brought his long rifle to bear, while the
Indian sprang up and poised his hatchet
for the. throw; but neither lead nor steel
were converging in orderly, array.. upon
the encampment, and at the blazing up
of the dry branches their leader gave the
command to charge.
What sham battle there was, or was
meant to be, was over in the briefest
space. The troopers galloped in with
shouts and aimless pistollngs, raising. a
clamor that was instantly doubled by the
yells of the Indians. As for resistance,
the charging troop met Â¦* with^ nothing
worse than the yellings and a scattering
fusillade in air. Then the ring of horse
men narrowed in to closer quarters and
there was some flashing of bare steel In
the firelight, at which the Cherokee.kid
napers melted away and vanished as if
by magic. ..
With the shouts and the firing Mar
gery and her maid had burst out of the
sleeping lodge to find themselves in the
thick of the sham battle: and it was but
womanlike that they ' should add * their
shrieks to the din. being as well terrified
as they had a right to be. But now the
leader of the attacking troop . speedily
brought order with a word of command;
and when his men fell back to post
themselves as vedettes among the trees,
the officer dismounted to uncover courte
ously and to bow low to the lady.
"The hoss-captain!" muttered Ephraim
Yeates under his breath; but we did not
need his word for it. 'Twas but a child's
pebble-toss across the barrier stream,
and we could both see and hear.
"I give you Joy of your escape, Mis
tress Margery," said the Baronet, mouth
ing his words like a player, who had long
since conned his lines and got them well
by heart and letter-perfect. "These slip
pery savages have given us a pretty
chase. I do assure you. . But you are
trembling yet; calm yourself, dear lady;
you are quite safe now."
I was watching her intently as he
spoke. 'Twas now hard upon two months
since I had seen her last in that fateful
upper room at Appleby Hundred.'fflld the
intervalâ or mayhap it was only the
hardships and distresses of the captive
flight â had changed her wofully. Yet
now, as when we had stood together at
the bar of Colonel Tarleton's court, I saw
her pass from mood to mood in the turn
ing of a leaf, her natural terror slipping
from her like a cast-off garment, and a
sweet dignity coming to clothe her In a
queenlier robe, making her, as I would
think, more beautiful than ever.
"I thank you. Sir Francisâ for myself
and for poor Jeanne." she said. "You
have come to take us back to my
father T' : O:'-:Z.
He bowed again and spread his hands
as a friend willing but helpless. Â¦
"Upon my honor, ray dear lady, noth
ing would give me greater pleasure. But
what can I say? We are upon the King's
business, as you well know, and our
mission will not brook an hour's delay
indeed, we are here only by the good
chance which led your captors to choose
our route for theirs. I have no alterna
tive but to take you and your woman
with us to the west; but I do assure
youâ â Â¦â¢ (q) Â¦
She stopped him with an impassioned
gesture of dissent, and darting a despair-
In and smite, giving no quarter.
The old borderer dwelt at length upon
the need for this severity, saying that a
single Cherokee escaping would bring the
warriors of the Erati tribe down upon
us to cut off all chance of our retreat
with the women. â
"Onless I'm mightily out o' my reck
toplns. this here spot we're a-setting on
"in't more than a day's lnjun-runnlng
from the Tuckasege Towns. With them
gals to hender us we ainf a-going to be
in no fettle for a skimper-scamper race
with a fresh wheen o' the redskins.
Therefore and wherefore, says I. make
them chopping-knives o' yourn cut and
come again, even to the dividing erpart
of soul and nrnrrer."
Dick laughed, and speaking for both of
us. said between his teeth that we were
not likely to be overmerclful.
But now . the : old wolf, of the border
gave us a glimDsVof an unsuspected side
of him. taking Jennifer sharply to talk
and reading him a homily on the sin of,
vengeance for vengeance's sake. In this
harangue he evinced a most astonishing
tongue-srasp of scripture, and for a good
half hour the air was thick with texts. .
It wanted yet a full hour of midnight
when Richard began again to plead pite
ously for instant action. Yeates thought
It sUll over-early, but when Jennifer
'pressed him hard the old borderer lelt
the casting vote to me. .
"What say ye, Cap't John? Your*n wm
be the next oldest head, and I reckon It
hain't been turned plumb "foolish ram
paging crazy by this here purty gal o
Gilbert Stair's."
Now you have read thus far In my
poor tale to little purpose if you have not
yet discovered the major weakness of an
old campaigner, which is to weigh and
measure all the chances, holding it to the
full as culpable to strike too soon_as too
late. This weakness was mine, and in
that evil moment I gave my vote for fur
ther waiting, arguing saplently that my
old field marshal would never set a night
assault afoot till well oh i toward the
dawn.
Jennifer heard me through and yielded,
perforce/though with little good- will.
"I cannot compass it alone, or, by the
gods, I'd go!" he asserted, angrily.
"Mark you, John Ireton, this delay Is a
thing you'll rue whilst you live. Your
cold-cut pros and cons mouth well enough ,
and I'm' no soldier lawyer to argue- them
down. But something better than your
damnable reasons tells me that the hour
has struckâ that these very present sec
onds are priceless." Whereupon he flung
himself face down in the grass and would
not speak again until the waiting time
was fully over and Yeates gave the word
to fall in line for the adrance.
Having learned the lay of the land in
his earlier reconnolssance, the old bord
erer shortened the distance for us by,
"guiding us across the neck' of a horseshoe
bend in the stream, and a half hour's
biind groping through the forest fetched
us out upon the river bank again,
time precisely opposite the Indians' lotige
tire on the other side.
Here there was a little pause for three
of us while Ephralm Yeates crept down
the bank to try with his sounding pole
what chance we had of crossing.
Measured by what could be seen from
our covert the narrow width of quick
watero seemed the last of the many ob
stacles.
Lulled to security, as we guessed, by
the apparent success of their ruse to
throw us off the scent, six of the Chero
kees were lying feet to fire like the
spokes of a wheel for which the fitful
blaze was the hub. The seventh man.
was squattedi before a small i tepee: lodge:
of dressed skins, which, as we. took it,
would be the sleeping quarters of the
captives. Whilst all the others lay stiff
and stark as if -wrapped In soundest
sleep, this sentry guard, too, it seemed,
was scarcely more 'than half awake, for
as we looked his gun was slipping from
the hollow of his arm and he was nod
ding to forgetfulness.
Richard was a-crouch beside me in this
peeping reconnoissance. and I could feel
him trembling In impatient eagerness.^
"It should be easy enoughâ what think
you?" he whispered, and then/ with a
sudden grasp upon my wrist: "You are
cool and steady-nerved, John Ireton; 1
swear you do not love her as I do!"
"Xay, I grant you that,* 1 - Dick," said I,
making sure that his excitement would
obscure the double meaning in the ad
mission. And then I added, sincerely
enough, "She has never given me the
right to love her at alL"
"God help her at this pass!" be said,
more to himself than to me, and then he
would go in a breath from blessing
Margery to cursing Ephraim. Yeates .for
this fresh delay. â¢ ' Â©
It was Uncanoola who broke in upon
the muttered ; malediction. Â» .
"Wall! Captain Jennlf cuss plenty
heap, like missionary medicine man.
Look-see! .Uncanoola no can find white
squaw horse yonder. Mebee Captain Jen
nif* see 'um, hey?"
, At his word we both looked for the
horses, marking now that they were no
where to be seen within the circle lighted
by the lodge fire. The Catawba grunted
his doubt that the enemy was as Inaleri
as he appeared to be; then he set the
doubt in Words. "Chelakee heap slick.
Sleep only one eye, mebee, hey? Injun
warrior no hit .Â» horse and go sleep both
eye on war path!"
Here our scout came gliding back, so
noiselessly that he was within arm's
reach before we heard him. Dick had
said I was over-cool, but the old man's
ghostlike reappearance made me prlnkle
to my fingers' ends.
"How will it be," Ephr* Dick queried,
hotly eager to be at work. "We can make
it across? Never pay we can't pass that
bit of still water, man!"
But Ephralm Yeates did say so In set
terms. Â¦'" 'Â¦ r -\.
"I reckon e* how we've jot to cross,
but not Jest here-away, Cap'n Dick. She -
ain't making any fuss about it, but she's
a-sllpping along like greased lightning,
deep and mighty powerful. I ain't say--
Ing we mought n't swim her and come out'
somewhere thin side of Dan'l Boone's
country, but we'll make It a heap quicker
by projecting- 'round till we find the ford
where them varmints made out to cross."
"God!" said Dick, deep in his throat,
"more time to be killed I Byâ"
The old man was parting the bushes to
have a better sight of the encampment
opposite, but at Dick's outbreak he fell
back quickly and clapped a hand on the
lips of cursing. .
"Hist! Lookee over yonder.wlll yel"
he cut In. And then In a whisper meant
for no ear but mine: "The Lord be
marclful to that little gal, Cap'n John;
we've fooled our chance awayâ the rame's
afoot, and we ain't In ltf" . -
: I looked and saw . . nothing save that -
the sentry guard had risen to , throw
a handful of Â¦ dry branches . on the
dying fire. But on the Instant .: the
dry wood blazed up, and in i the wider -
circle of . firelight I saw what . the keener 1
eyes of Ephralm Yeates had described the I
sooner.' In the ' shadowy background of
the surrounding forest a dozen horsemen :
furnace-hot, as were all the fair weather
days of that never-to-be-forgotten sum
mer, with a still a!r in the forest that
hung thick and lifeless like the.atmos
phere of an oven; this though we were
well among the mountains and rising
higher with every added mile of wester
ing. -
The sun had passed the meridian and
we were toiling, sweaty-weak, up a rock
strewn mountainside, when a thing oc
curred to rouse us ro'ughly from the fam
ine stupor and set us watchfully alert
In the steeDest part of the ascent, 1 where
the wood, scanted of rooting ground by
the thickly sown strewing of holders, was
open and free of undergrowth, Ephralm
Yeates halted suddenly, signed to us
with UDflung hand and dropped behind a
tree as one shot, and in the same breath
the Catawba, running at Yeates' heels,
lurched aside and vanished as if the
earth had gaped and swallowed him.
A moment later the twang of a bow
string buzzed upon the breathless noon
tide stillness, and Jennifer clutched and
dragged me down in good time to let the
arrow whistle harmless over us. Then,
like a distorted echo of the buzzing bow
string, the sharp crack of the old border
er's rifle rang out smartly, setting the
cliff-crowned mountainside all a-clamor
with mocking repetitions.
"Missed him. slick and clean, by the
eternal coonskin!" growled the marks
man, sitting up behind his tree to reload.
"That there's what comes o 'being so
dad-blame' hongry that ye can't squinch
fair atween the gun-sights. I reckon ez
how ye'd better hunker down and lie
clost. you two. 'Twouldn't s'prise me none
if that redskin had a wheen more o' them
sharp-p'inted sticks in hi?â The Lord be
praised for all his marcies! the chiefs
got him!"
But Uncanoola had not. He came in
presently, his black eyes snapping with
Yeates' auestion that the yell had been
his own; that his tomahawk had sped no
truer than the old borderer's bullet.
"Che!akee snake heap slick; heap quick
dodgre." was all we could get out of him;
and when that was said he squatted calm
ly on a fiat stone and fell to work grind
ing the nick out of the edge of the mis
sped hatchet.
This Incident told up plainly enough
that the kidnapers were now but a little
way ahead, and that their rear guard
scouts vrere holding us well in hand. So
from that on we went as men whose lives
are held in pawn by a hidden foe, looking
at every turn for an ambushment. Never
theless we were not waylaid again, and
when at length the long: hot afternoon
drew to its close with the mountain of
peril well behind us we had neither seen
nor heard aught else of the Cherokees.
That night we camped, tireless and food
less, on the banks of a swift-flowing
stream in a valley between two great
mountains. We reached this stream a lit
tle before dark, and since the trail led
straight into the water vre would have put
this obstacle behind us if we could. But
though the little river was not above five
or six poles in width it was exceeding
swift and deep; so impassable, in truth,
that we were moved to wonder how the
captive party had made shift to cross.
We guessed at it awhile. Richard and I,
and then gave it up until we might have
the helD of better daylight. But the old
borderer's curiosity was not so readily
postponed. Cutting^ a slim pole from a
sapling thicket, he waded in cautiously,
archoringr himself by the drooping
branches of the willows whilst he prodded
and sounded and proved beyond ia doubt
that the current was over man-head deep
and far/too cfapid -for swimming.
Satisfied of this, he came out, dripping,
and with a monitory word to us to keep a
sharp lookout, disappeared upsfream in
the crowing dusk, his long rifle at the
trail and his body bent to bring his kÂ«ien
old eyes thenearer to the ground.
CHAPTER XXIL
HOW THE FATES GAVE LARGESS OP
*>Â£i DESPAIR. v
Ephralm Yeates was gone a full hour.
When he returned he gave us cause to
wonder at his lacH of caution, since he
filled his earthen Indian pipe and coolly
struck a light wherewith to fire it. But
when the pipe was aglow he told us of
bis findings. â¢
" 'Twas about ez I reckoned; them var
mints waded in the shallows a spell to
throw up off and then came out and
forded hKher up."
"That will be a shrewd guess of yours.
I take It. Ephraim?" said I, for the night
was black as Erebus.
. ''Ne'er a guess at all; I've had 'em fair
at eyehoits," Ois as calmly as if we had
uot been for ten long days pinning our
faith to an Ill-defined trace of footprints.
"Ez 'I. was a-going on to say, they're
incamped on t'other bank ruther eenside
o' two sights and a horn-blow from this.
I saw 'em and counted 'emâ seven red
skins and the two gals."
â¢Thank God!" says Richard, as fer
vently as if our rescue of thfe women were
already a thing accomplished. Then he
fell upon the scout with an eager ques
tion: "How does she look, Ephraim?â tell
me how she looks!"
"Listen at him!" said the old man,
cackling his dry little laugh. "How in
tarnation am I going to know which *she'
he's a-stewlne about? There's a pair of
'em, and they both look like wimmln ez
have been dragged hilter-skilter trough
the big woods for some better f n a week.
Katheless they're fitting to- set up and
take their nourishment, both on 'em.
They was perching on a log afore the
fire, with ever" last idintlcal one o* them
redskins a-walting on 'em like they was a
couple of Injun queens. -"5 reckon ez how
the hoss-captain gave them varmints
their orders, partlc'lar."
Dick was upon his feet, lugging out the
great broadsword.
"Show us the way, Eph Yeates!" he
burst out impatiently. "We are wasting
a deal of precious time!"
But the old man only puffed the more
placidly at his pipe, making no move to
bead a sortie.
"Fair an' easy, Cap'n Dick; fair and
easy. There ain't no manner o' hurry, ez
I allow. Whenst I've cot to tussle with
a wheen o' full redskins, and me with my
stummlck growed fast to my backbone,
I jest ez soon wait till them same red
skins are asleep. Blme-by they'll settle
down for the night, and then we'll go up
yonder and plzen 'em immejltly, if not
sooner. But there ain't no kind o' use to
spile it all by rampaging 'round too soon."
There was wisdom undeniable In this,
and, accordingly, we waited, taking turns
at the hunter's terrible pipe In lieu of
supper, and laying our plan of attack.
This last was simple enough, as our re
sources, or rather our lack of them/ would
make It. At midnight we would move up
on the enemy, feeling our way along the
river till we should discover the ford by
which the captive party had crossed. The
stream safely passed, we would deploy
and surround the camp of the Indians,
and at the signal, which was to be the
report of Yeates' rifle, we were to close
"Come, chief: give us the wo'th of your
Jedgment. Has the old Gray Wolf gone
*tun-blind? or did he read them sign
like they'd ort to be read?"
"Waii! the Gray Wolf has sharp eye â
sharp nose â sharp tongue, some time.
Sign no can lie when he read 'um."
Jennifer turned to me. "What say you.
Jack? *Tls all far enough beyond me. I'll
confess." '
I was as much at sea touching the
mystery as he was; yet the thing to do
seemed plain enough.
"Never mind the Baronet's mystery;
'tis Mistress Margery's hazard that con
cerns us." I would say. And then to
Ephralm Teates: "Will this rain kill the
trail, think you?"
He shook his head dubiously. "I dun
no for sartain; 'twill make a heap o' dif
fer* If they was anyways anxious to hide
it. Ex it starts out. with the women a
hossback. 'tis plain enough for a blind
man to lift on the run."
"Then let us be at it," said L "We
can very well afford to let the mystery
untangle itself as we go." And with this
the pursuit began in relentless earnest.
The trail of the two horses ridden by
Margery and her woman cut a right an
gle with the road, turning northwest
along the left bank of the stream; and.
despite the rain, which was now pouring
eteadlly even- in the thick wood, the
hoof prints were so plainly marked that
we could follow at a smart dog trot.
In this speeding the old hunter and
the Indian easily outwearied Jennifer
and me. They both ran with a slow
swinging leap, like the racking gait, half
jÂ»a.ee. half gallop, of a well-trained troop
horse. Mile after mile they put behind
them in these swinging bounds; and
when, well on in the afternoon, we
stopped to eat a snack of the cold meat
and to slake our thirst at one of the
many rain pools. I was lain to follow
Jennifer's lead, throwing myself flat on
the soaking mold to pant and gasp and
pay oft the arrears of breathlessness.
This breathing halt was of the brief
est; but before the race began again,
Ephralm Yeates took time to make a
careful scrutiny of the trail, measuring
the stride of the horses and looking
sharply to the briars for some bit of
cloth or other token of assurance.^ When
we came jp with him he was mumbling
to himself.
"Um-hm; Jes' m3 They was a-making
tracks along hereaway, sartain. sure;
larruping themhosses to a keen Jump,
liekity-eplit. Now. says I to myself,
what's the tarnatioiP hurry? Ain't they
go*, all the time there is to get where
they're a-F.jing, immej'tly. if not
sooner?" Then he turned upon me.
"Cap'n John, can't you and the yo-ngster
lay your heads side and side and make
out what-all this here hoss-captain
mought be u^ to? If do look like he had
some sort o' hatchet to grind, a-sendirsr
that Afrikin back to raise a hue and
cry, and then a- letting his Injuns leave
a trail liLe tnis he-e that any towhead
boy from the 3ettlemints could follow at
a canter."
Richard said he couH never guess the
meaning of it all; a* d my mind was to
the full as blank as his. I made sure
6omc deep-laid plot was -it the bottom of
the mystery; but we had measured many
weary mites in the wiMerness and the
plotter's trap hid been fai'ly bailed, set
and sprur.^. before the lightning dash of
explication came to shear us all its dev
ilish Ingenuity.
But now "Forward" was the word, and
we fell ir line again, and again the tire
less running of l.ie two guides stretched
and held us "a the rack of weariness.
Happily for us t to Â«vno were out of
training, the rainy-da*- dusk came early;
and though Yeates and vae In '.Ian. run
ning now with their bodies bent Jouble
and their noses to the ground, held r on
long after Richard Jennifer and I were
bat-blind for i ay seeing of the hoof
prints, the end came at length i>nd we
bivouacked as we were, f -eless, and with
the last of'th* cooked ' ration of dÂ«Â»er's
meat for a scanty supper.
After the meal, which was swallowed
hastily in the silence utter fatigue.
we scooped a hollow in a last year's leaf
bed end lay down to sleep, wet | to the
6kin as any four half-drowned water
rata, and to the full as miserable.

HOW WE KEPT LE.VTEN VIG T LS IN
TRIXITYTIDE.
'Twould weary you beyon : thÂ«s limit
of good-nature were I to try to vlcture
out at large the varied haps h.nd hazards
of our wanderings In the savage wilder
ness. For the actors in any play the
trivial details have their place and
meaning momentous enough, it may be;
yet these are often wearisome to the box
or stall yawning impatiently for the cli
max.
So. if you please, you are to conceive
us four, the strangest ill-assorted com
pany on the footstool, pushing on from
day to day deeper and ever deeper Into
the pathless forest solitudes, yet always
with the plain-marked trail to guide us
You will not think it strange that f
should have but dim and misty memories
of this fainting time. Of all privations
famine soonest blunts the senses, making
a man oblivious of all save that which
drives him onward. The happenings
tfcat I remember clearest are those which
turned upon some temporary bridging of
the hunger gulf. OnÂ© was Yeates' killing
of a milch doe which, with her fawn, ran
across our path when we had fasted two
whole dayi. By this, a capital crime In
any hunter's code, you may guess how
cruelly we were nipped in the hunger
vise.
For all the sharp privations of the
forced march there was no hint on any
lip of turning back. With Margery's des
perate need to key us to the unflinching
pitch Blchard and I would go on while
there was strength to set one foot before
the other. But for the old borderer knd
tho Indian there was no such bellows to
blow the fire of perseverance. None the
less these two did more than second us;
they set the strenuous pace and held us
to It.
We had been ten days In this starving
wilderness, driving onward at the pace
that kills and making the most of every
hour of daylight, before Teates and the
Indian beran to give us hope that we
were finally closing in upon our quarry.
The dragging length of the chase grew
upon two conditions. From the beginning
the kidnapers were able to increase their
lead by stretchinr out the days and bor
rowing from the nights; also they were
doubtless well provisioned, and they had
horses for the captives and their impedi
menta. But as for us we could follow
only while the daylight let us see the
trail, and though we ran well at first the
lack of proper food soon took toll of
speed.
So now. though the hoof prints grew
hourly fresher, and we were at last so
close upon the heels of the kidnapers that
their night camp fires were scarcely cold
when we came upon them, we ran no
longerâ coujd hardly keep a dogged foot
pace for the hunger pains that griped and
bent' us double.

Jasper knew a good many peopleâ a

knew in this wide world the individual
that he particularly preferred to know
waa a girl in the college town. The last
name of this girl was a name to conjure
with, for it was Wllloughby, and the rea
son was that hÂ«r father was Wllloughby,
the trolley magnate and multi-millionaire.
This made her popular among the men
But to Jasper it was sufficient that her
first name was Marion and that he, and
lie alone, bad the privilege of using her
first name, rather than her last. Jasper
was glad that such a girl lived an<? moved

and face were brown as berries. He pat

thing to turn up.
A few people in the aurf turned to
watch Miss Wllloughby swim out to sea.
The brown life-saver kept glancing up
and down t,he coast.
Afar out. In the unseen distance, some
thing had happened an hour or bo be

of a Ftorm. The wireless announcement
of it came only in the shape of one great

some thirty-three minutes later Manning-
Jasper staggered up out of the surf with

of one thins, and that was that but for
a certain fact he might never have been

j ' wJSt"t s?AS/ 9 name was Kelsey
[iT^^^^^^^l Kelsey wore more

and he had a perfect right to do it, for
he was graduated from everything from
grammar school to Heidelberg Univer
sity, which is more than can be said of
a G. P. -A. & T. M.
Kelsey could read Sanscrit with one
eye, Greek with the other, write Arabic
and talk Latin to beat the Pope all at
the same time, lie could translate the
hieroglyphics on the stones of Egypt,
explain why magnetic disturbances are
indicative of the approach of the pe
riod of maximum sun spots, why one
half of a eeldlltz powder is always
wrapped ln blue paper and the other ln
white, and why hens don't crow. He
could clasBlfy a flower by its odor, a
flsh by its bite, or a bird by Its tail
feather. \ . â¢
Kelsey knew William Shakespeare by
heart, Richard Harding Davis by sight
and Mary MacLane by reputation.
Fact Is, he knew everything except the
current brand of woman.
Kelsey had everything except a wife,
and when the women got wise to that
fact they baited their hooks for him
and made no bones of It. They or
ganized debating contests, biblio
graphical parlor societies, bugging and
botanizing expeditions, and a lot of
other pastimes calculated to inveigle
him into stepping, unbeknownst, upon
their flypaper.
Whenever one of the pettlcoated
trappers got a promise of a call from
Kelsey she would shut herself up in
the parlor and bury her face in the en
cyclopaedia until she had something
deep down - pat. - Then she . would 1 put
the calf- bounds back - ; on the Â¦ shelves
,and cook up a scheme to have the sub-.
Ject come up by accident, so that;Kel
pey would think she knew Just as, much
about everything else. , But when;Kel
sey called something, always happened
to steer him away from . what : she had
been looking up. Â¦
If she tried to lead up to > botany , by
speaking of the ; color of a" new chrys
anthemum she would .; start ; Kelsey
emitting elucidation about the primary
colors as seen through the spectrum,
and how they ; are formed '. by * rays 1 of
light or other, radiant energy. In which
the parts are arranged . according Â¦ to
fore she could shoot her bolt.
Such was the case with every dame
who stacked the cards so that she could
con Kelsey into thinking she was real
intelligent and eligible to preside over
the aft end of his table.
Of course,, they knew it was very
naughty and wicked to pretend to
know a whole lot about the awfully
profound things, but .what else could
they do to win a man who was cer
tainly too brilliant to care for a clrl
who was the least bit frivolous?
WeU, to get to the point, wherever
Kelsey went the He-catchers tried to
win him out by displaying their Break
fast Food brand of intellect, but there
was nothing doing.
One day Kelsey met a giddy little
blue-eyed blonde, who could talk noth
ing more abstruse than caramels, chif
fon and Booth Tarkington. Blondy
was an affectionate little thing and
very becoming to a cozy corner. When
the got Kelsey Into the ppeak-easy
where hung guns, swords, shields and
Indian blankets., she nestled her curly
head" upon his bosom, lifted her won
dering eyes and said, "Does 00 *uv

Kelsey must have, for he married
her the next day.

father's keen scrutiny without flinch
ing. Miss Marsden was a worthy
daughter of the great political leader.
"Mr. Gregory waa with you â and I
happen to know that he is not inter
ested ln orchids."
"Gregory of Hampton!"
The words had become the scorn of
the political headquarters over which
Mr. Marsden presided. In truth, Greg
ory of Hampton was a thorn in the
wire-puller's flesh. He was unap
proachable, unbribable, and, from Mr.
Mareden's point of view, hopelessly un
reasonable.
The apportionment bill was strictly
trained by Marsden to give his party
better control of the State legislative
branches. It was not a vicious measure,
but knowing that his heart was set
upon it the younger element, who
had begun to murmur against the iron
rule of "the boss." had vigorously op
posed the bill.
Its defeat meant the dethronement
cf Marsden, and the assumption of
party leadership by one of the younger
men. Gregory had entered the fight
under instructions from his district
.leaders â staid, back-country farmers to
whom new-fangled politics did not ap
peal. Self-reliant and gifted with the
faculty of dominating others, he had
unconsciously assumed the leadership
of the opposition and was already
â¢poken of as Marsden's probable suc
cessor.
All this was passing through Mars
den's mind, as he watched his daugh
ter run through her morning's mail,
and wished she would speak. But
clearly she was not in a communica
tive mood. Â¦"â¢â¢.
*'I suppose you help receive at the
Governor's reception this afternoon.
Well, go where you like, though I don't
care for that daughter of his. Only
remember one thing, there is to be no
nonsense between you and this young
Gregory. The apportionment bill gives
nu almost complete control and It's
rot to go through. Gregory, by his
obstinacy, encourages the opposition.
I've started to put it through, and I'll
do It, If It takes my last dollar."
"I hardly think It Is worth while for
you to waste money on Mr. Gregory.
He's not that sort."
Margaret had risen and now stood,
pale and tcnee, before her father,
whose face had turned livid.
"Don't tell me It has gone as far as
that? Could you stand by this man
in preference to your father? Think,
child, think, you're all I have* In the
world sinceâ since your mother's gone."
The lips of the political leader
twitched. The girl, .who was the liv

occupied the one soft spot In his cal
loused, scheming heart \
At mention of her mother's name
Margaret turned swiftly and twined
her arms around her father's neck.

A funny thing hapened one day. It
waa funny even to Private O'Day. aa
he tried his best to look at it in a
serious light. He fell in lovÂ« with
Kitty Cllne, the major's daughter. He
fell In love with her at a distance â
clear across the parade ground at Fort
Sherman. She had been at the fort
for three or four weeks, but that was
his nrst sight of her. She was 18
and O'Day was 30; she was a
major's daughter, used to a life of
luxury, while he was a high private
on $13 per month. The social gulf
between them was as wide as the At
lantic Ocean, and O'Day knew it, and
whispered in his > own ear:
"Patrick O'Day, ye are a bigger
donkey than ever ye left behind ye
In old Ireland, and ye ought to be
taken out and kicked across the Darade
ground. The idea of your losine yer
heart to such a gurl as that! Are yez
gittln' soft in the top of yer head, or
is It the foolishness Just comln' out
But it was one thing to talk and
another to do. Private O'Day was
hard hit â so hard that he could not
keep his secret, and when It became
known to a dozen of his comrades ha
was guyed and jeered and berated by
turns. Two or three days of- It ought
to have worked a cure and sent Pat
rick along to barracks No. S. where
the widow laundress of Company B.
who was known to have $450 In the
bank, would have welcomed him with
smiles. It failed, however, and In his
desperation the soldier-lover did a
foolish thing. Being on sentry duty
at the gate one day he removed his
cap and bowed to the major's daughter
as she rode forth on her pony. He did
more. He had a 25-cent box of candy
In the bosom of his Jacket, purchased
for the occasion, and he hauled it
forth and begged her to accept It as
a slight* token of his feelinsrs toward
her. Of course she looked down upon
him with feelings of amazement and
refused his gift, and, of course, some
one witnessed the performance and
told of it, and Private O'Day was sent
to the guardhouse for making: a
monkey of himself.
The next morning the soldier, whose
loving heart had been deeply grieved
by the rejection* of his confectionery,
was detailed : to police- duty along
with other derelicts, and that was a
further humiliation. The flnlshlnsr blow
was at hand. After eome general work
about the parade grounds he was set
to cleaning up the major's back yard,
just where â¢ the major's daughter could
have a full view of him as he rolled the
ash barrels about, and thousrh he had
no cause to believe that she was Deep-

manded two or three times by the cor

ation he outraged military discipline
by sasslng back." HÂ« was ordered to
report himself at the guardhouse as
under new arrest, and it was while
making his way to that popular and
well-known resort that he suddenly de
cided to make a bolt for it- A citizen
had ridden into the fort on a flnÂ« piece
of horseflesh and thrown the reins over
a post near tha gate, and Private O'Dav
reached and mounted the animal and
was galloping away before the sentinel
at tha gate had opened and shut his
mouth.
There waa delay in following the
fugitive, and when pursuit was made
he had a Ion* start, and hti trail was
lost, as he rode through the scrub to
ward Devils Canyon. It was 10
o'clock in the forenoon when ha gal
loped out of the fort, and it was an
hour later, and ha had covered eight
miles of ground, when he rode Into
the western mouth of the canyon. He
wanted to dodge pursuit for a time,
and ho wanted a quiet place in which
to do some thinking. There was a
second reason, and that was that a
thunderstorm was coming up from
the southwest, and Private O'Day
never got his jacket wet when there
was a chance to keep it dry. He could
find a dozen of places in the grim.
dark canyon where he would be shel
tered from the threatened downpour.
Unknown to the soldier who had
monkeyed with the buzzsaw, the ma
jor's daughter had ridden forth on her
pony two or three hours previous to
his appearance as one of the sanitary
squad, and If he hadn't been so busy
nursing his wounded heart he would
have noticed the hoof-prlnts leading
him all the way. The girl had don?
a foolish thing to ride down into that
somber gorge, where the cinnamon
bear hid away for his noonday sleep,
and great lizards crawled up and down
and hissed at the serpents; but she
was a girl of whims, and this was
one of them. She not only entered
the canyon's mouth, but forced her
wondering and frightened pony along
over the stony trail, until she could
no longer see daylight unless looking
upward. Bhe was halted there when
the thunder began to roll and the
lightning to flash, and she had not yet
turned her horse when Private O'Day.
further down and off his horse and
under the shelter of a ledge, heard a
sound no man forgets after hearing It
once. The big black cloud, with its
tens of thousands of barrels of water,
had hit the peak of the mountain and
burst, and the jar and roar of it was
followed by the swishing - and swash
ing of a torrent coming down the can
yon. The soldier had sprung for his
horse to mount and away when he
heard the clatter of the pony's hoofs.
and next moment the animal slipped
and fell at his feet and flung Its rider
over its head. O'Day saw that It was
a girl, but without knowing her Iden
tity he picked her up as she lay
in an unconscious state, placed her on
the saddle before him and made the
race. The waters were throwing sprav
clear over him as he debouched from
the canyon's mouth and wheeled to the
left.
"M7 man," said the colonel to him
that afternoon, after calling him to
headquarters. "I. want to shake hands
with . you and call you a brave man.
and tell you how grateful I em. You

to make false pretenses, useless for me
to deny my love for you. And yetâ I
am my father's all. And no matter
how happy we might be, I should al
ways feel that I had robbed him of
the reward for his faithful care of me.
Can't you understand? He has been
bo good to me alwaysâ and I owe him
everything. You must make my an
swer for me. TWs afternoon I under
stand thev take another vote on the
bill which stands between me and hap
piness. Your vote will be my answer.
If it is 'No,' do not see me again. It
will be easier for us both, and surely
you owe my love that much considera
tion. Faithfully yours,
"MARGARET MARSDEN."
The ladles' gallery of the Assembly
chamber was thronged with brilliantly
gowned women. The fourth day of the
deadlock, and rumor had gone forth
that there were prospects of a break.
Members on the floor bowed to ac
quaintances in the gay array of but
terflies. Gregory of Hampton Bent but
one long, searching glance in their di
rection, but in that look he caught a
vision In the background, a .slender,
gray gowned figure. A chiffon- veil hid
her features, but under the drooping
brim of her hat he caught the glint of
bronze gold hair. For an Instant the
hard, set look died from his eyes, and
a tender smile rested on his lips. Then
he glanced toward Marsden's desk. A
group of men fawned upon the leader,
who seemed not to notice them. His
face was gray-white, his eyes a steely
blue. But Gregory of Hampton read
behind the look of grim determination
â to the years of interminable strug
gle, to the home life sacrificed, the
wife-love neglected, all for political
power. And this same power lay with
in his own grasp. If the apportionment
bill failed. Leadership of men, or life
companionship and the love of a pure
woman? The plaudits of the public or
the caresses of a love for which he
hungered as he had never hungered
and lonred and yearned for anything
In all his buay, successful life? The
House was called to order. Cold per
spiration bathed his motionless figure.
His arras were crossed on his breast.
His eyes were fixed on the Speaker.
Sudden silence fell upon the floor and
the crowded galleries.
The clerk cleared his voice and ner
vously adjusted his glasses. Marsden
Bat with the tabulated vote of two days'
before in his hand. To Margaret It
seemed as if the alphabet held a thous
and letters. Would the "G's" never
come.
"Finch."
"No." Faint applause.
"Garrity!"
"Aye!" Mingled hisses and cheers.
"Gorman!" Gregory's eyelids quiv
ered just a trifle and. his glance shifted
for an Instant to the bent head with
Its glint of bronze gold, v
"No!" Increased applause.
"Gregory!"
For one brief second Margaret's heart
stopped beating.
"Aye!"
Every reporter at the tables above
the Speaker's head took a fresh grip
on his pencil. There waa a sensation !
Consternation spread over. the. faces 'of
the men who had been following Greg
ory's lead. The machine element
cheered and the Speaker wrapped, for
order.
Marsden 'olded his arms and glanced
at the gallery, where Margaret had
suddenly risen and was now making
for the entrance. Just what part had
she played In this little drama, he won
dered. The vote went on, but he did
not listen. With Gregory on their side
victory was assured. When he finally
made his way through the crush after
the vote was concluded, neither" hip
daughter nor Gregory was In sight. Thei
former had entered her coupe, said the
doorman, and another man told him
that some one had seen Gregory swing
Into a hack and the driver had started
the horse up at a terrific pace.
But Gregory had not followed Mar-
garet. It was dark before his ride end
ed, and he came back to town, a trifle
v.hite In the face, but with eyes serene
ly happy. .
Marsden came upon them in the li
brary and extended his hand with awk
ward attempt at cordiality.
"I am glad you could finally see
things our way," he commenced. -Then
words died on his lips.
Margaret and Gregory turned toward
him and there was that In ,the latter's
face which stilled the voice of the polit
ical leader. He gazed dumbly at this
young man, born to lead, whom no
amount of wire pullijig, no offers of po
litical preferment, no bribe however al-
luring could move, and yet, who, for
love of his clip of a girl, had deliberaf,^
ly turned his back on a brilliant polliU
cal career, i
Would he have done as mucb'at the
same age for love of this girl's mother?
He looked up suddenly and his glance
met the eyes of his wife, gazing at hlrr^
wistfully from a large oil painting:
How often her eyes had met his In real
life â Just that same way.
P'or the first time in years something
like a prayer of thanksgiving welled up
from the heart of the "boss." The ap
portionment bill turned miserably in-
Elgnlhcant. Without a word he turned
upon his heel, but at the door he looked
back and a smile of real happinessâ
not triumph, rested on his thin, blood
less lips. His daughter's head rested
confidingly on the shoulder of Gregory
of Harapton.

Rocksena brought the three largest

soft southern fragrance and to ripple
out the melody of tranquil waters
flowed Into the damp, soft gloaming:

Silas smoked and considered for five
silent minutes. r>
And on the silver-swept porch of the
log cabin, two. women sat gossiping
happily together. '.

"Straight ahead rode Jocasta, thÂ» reins bow in him left fcaad and hla re-rolver tn him right.*
Mabel had always been accustomed
to admiration, but now she, woke uo to
the fact that there ' was keen rivalry
lor her hand. Young Barndt fretted
For reasons not stated, the elder
Barndt wished his son well out of New
York for the winter, at least. One of
them was a certain pretty chorus girl
who had settled herself in a little flat
unpleasantly close to the great apart
ment-house wherein dwelt the Barndt
family. . Mr. , Farnham was indebtedâ
or imagined he was â to Mr. Barndt.
and a position for the younger Barndt
was made somehow : on the clerical
staff at the mills. And quite as natur
ally young Barndt mede for himself a
place in the Farnham home. , 'Twas the*
only fit place in the" town, he explained
to himself.
But then North\Â»la*cow did not un
derstand Mabel, and Mabel cared pre
cious little whether he did or
not. Bhe did Â¦ not feel called
upon to detail her dally life
nor analyze her motives for the edi
fication of the town gossips. That
was why the sharp-tongued women of
the manufacturing town did not know
that when Mabel went tearins through
the main street on her little mare, or
trotted past In her dogcart, she was
pretty sure to drop in^Â£> her father's
dingy office with a kiss and a merry
greeting. Nor could they dream that
the young girl who danced when op
portunity offered until almost moraine
tripped downstairs in the most be
witching negligees to pour' her father's
feoffee and smiled sleepily hut good
humoredly across the table at him.
What they did hear was\that Mabel
lay abed till 11 o'clock (which was
quite true, for she went directly back
to bed when her father had driven
away), and Bent to Boston for wraD
pers and coffee Jackets of lace and silk,
such as no respectable, hard-worklnsr
woman in North Glascow ever dreamed
of wearing. They did not dream,
either, that she wore cherry ribbons
in those same negligees, when she loved
blue best. Just because her adoring
father had once remarked that red
was the only color in the rainbow worth
considering.
At regular intervals, what was
known a.* the sociai set ol Glascow
went In its best array and as many
carriuget* as the town coj:a support
to be Â«ntertained in state at the mill
owner's brick and stone pile on the hill,
and came away to discourse on the
shocking waste of electricity, the ab
surdly massive decorations of Ameri
can Beauty roses, the dreadful expense
of a caterer from Boston, when Miss
Louise Crocker could have managed
the whole thing for half the price. And
Mabel's gown! The brocade had surely
come from Paris, and it was far too
elaborately trimmed for so young a
girl. Well. It was a pity that Mrs.
Farnham had not lived to steady down
thl3 frolicsome daughter and keep a re
straining hand on the household ex
penses of Donald Farnham.
Â¥ Little they knew how hateful the
display was to Mabel, how she longed
sometimes to close down the house,
with Its gilt furniture and plush hang
ings, and to join some of the girls
she had met at college. In their trips
abroad, where the world was old and
rich in art and book lore. But this was
her father's life, the life for which he
had longed In those early days when
her pinafores were short and his work
ing ' hours long. He was master of
North Glascow to-day, and he reveled
in his sense of greatness and power.
It was Just when Mabel was hunger
ing for a broader life, when North
Glascow seemed unbearably narrow,
and when she had dazed Its gossips by
some parUcularly unconventional frol
ics, that Harold Barndt came Into their
life. â¢;.. ...

that when It came to the question of
matrimony, the pretty daughter of. the
big mlllowner might be sensible for
once. â¢
"It was dreadfully silly. Jimmy."
she said softly, as they walked slowly
back to the house. "And you mustn't
think that it is just because I trusted
my decision to a foolish superstition.
But It's because the little things make
up our lives â at least they make a
woman happy. Some men" â she del
icately refrained from mentioning
Barndtâ "would have stayed In the
house and let me look into the empty
pool. And I want some one who un
derstands me: who thinks of the little
things for me. I've been thinking for
other people so longâ"
Jimmy held her tremblins hand tight
In his big. strong one.
"I think I understand, dear."

softly. "I've known It for ever so lone
â only I couldn't quite â " *
And again he put hÂ»Â« *-â¢' ~n the un
certain w.o-ds. But all North O!asc:w
thinks to this day that it was just be
cause of the Hallowe'en superrtitition
that Mabel accepted Jimmy, and
fought the good fight against her
father's pride and disappointment.
"Now each girl must walk down to
the spring, quite alone, and look into
it for the face of her husband- to- be."
announced the, hostess, in the tones of
an oracle. She held up a white fas
cinator, for the night was cool, and
Mabel's hand v.-as the first to reach
for it.
"I hope you are not going to en
danger your health by such nonsense."
Mabel turned to look Into young
Barndt's scowling face. He had been
greatly bored, as he had predicted,
and this was the last straw in his load
of misery.
"I thought you had too much sense
to be superstitious."
"Perhaps," answered Mabel, with an
odd laugh. And then she was gone.
While the merry party awaited her
return, Mabel walked slowly through
the moon-lit garden to the spring. ShÂ«
was thinking of them both â Jimmy
Crawford, who. though the life of the
party, had seemed somehow to b*
watching her all the evening, and
Barndt, with his polished manners and
his sulky eyes. Then she bent over the
spring and smiled. She had felt it all
alongâ that his face would look over
her shoulder, and their reflections
would be side by "side.
Mabel smiled in the dark. Would
he always be satisfied with that do
mestic picture she wondered. . -.- *\
Matters came to a head on Hallow
e'en night. With young Barndt at her
side, Mabel had driven throusrh the
crisp autumn air to the Hallowe'en
frolic at Myrtle Graham's home.
Barndt's roses were fastened under her
cloak, and on the table at home the
box of bonbons he had ordered sent to
her each Saturday lay unopened. He
had tucked her into the carriage, but
now he sulked openly.
"These country social affairs are
such a bore, don't you know. I sup
pose we shall bob for apples and ruin
our clothes, and come home deucedlv
tired. I'd much rather have the even
ing at home, with you at the piano and
the lamplight falling on your hair."
a week or so for the pretty actress,
and then decided that, averaging up
joints, Mabel had a trifle the best of
It: to say nothing of her financial pros*
pects. as the only child of the mill
owner. And Jimmy Crawford had
loved* her ever since the flrst day he
had opened the big mill gate for Mabel,
a dainty vision In white with a cherry
sash. Jimmy had been a bobbin boy
that day. Now he was superintendent,
and a better superintendent did not
boss a mill In all New England, said
Mr. Farnham, which went to show that
the owner of the mill Judged the younsr
superintendent by his ability to get
work out of employes and not by tha
state of his affections. The latter would
certainly have given . the self-made
man much concern. He meant, when
he had accumulated money enough, to
marry Mabel Into a family with blood.
Mabel had never taken Jimmy's de
votion seriously until young Barndt
appeared on the scene. Then something
In the mystery which she read In the
face of her long-devoted and much
tried admirer appealed to her more
womanly nature, and though North
Glascow never dreamed of It. Mabel

IN THE SPRING

looked upon as harmless. Jocasta was
a liar. His father and mother were
liars before and after him. When he
could get any one to listen to him he
would descend from his pedestal and
tell of the thoueands of female hearts
he had broken, and of the hundreds
of men he had had to plant by the
â¢wayside. He lied by wholesale and
retail, and his hearers lausrhed at his
lies instead of criticizing. There was
only one handicap. The flrst time he

a great deal of curiosity as to what

war ponies, had bÂ«en lying in ambush
to pick up any straggler frutn ih*

guards, but as noon came and everv

around the rude campflres and cook-
Ing booths to eat their midday meal.
It was then that Jocasta, busy with his
own thoughts but casting eyes around
him, saw the Indians leather for a
swift gallop to cut off three men who
had gone afar for a stick of timber.
Without haste, and without a word to
any one, he rose up. A hundred feet
away was a pony saddled and hridi*-Â«l
and standing in the shade, and in his
own belt was the Inevitable "cun."

ever made use of It except as an orna

curiosity until he slowly took his seat
In the saddle. Then mÂ«n rose uo to

from his place of concealment, and,
witn the camera bulb in his hand, sits
himself down and talks to the Infant
terrible until- he is fairly quiet, when
he presses the bulb and the trick Is
done. And the results of having; baby
photographed r Just as he really ; looks
in the midst of his games have made
the* baby studios immensely popular.
Here is what Boye says of the new in
stitution:
"The photographer, who. possesses a
genuine love for children " ; and '< a keen
appreciation of the many,! little things
that'only childrerican do and 'say, has
his way already paved for him : to , suc
cess. Particularly so is this the ; case,
if he add to these qualifications an
abundant supply of patience and the
faculty ; to grasp and take advantage of
the occasional happy situations that his
little subjects unconsciously â¢' fall into
while at play before the camera.

there is trouble, which rarely ends un
til his outraged majesty has been pro
pitiated with a gift of some sort from
among all the many treasures over
which he has just had such complete
and uninterrupted sway.
Only in this way can the baby be
snapshotted Just as he looks at play
with any degree of certainty* of secur
ing pictures that do not look posy and
unnatural. While he is delving about
among the toys and reveling in the de
light of having all the furniture in the
room baby size, he never suspects for
a moment that the photographer,
whom he has come to regard with anx
ious awe. Is concealed In that big book
case in a corner of the room, which
contains as well a big camera, and
,that he is being pictured and pictured
the while he is playing with such glee
and complete absorption.
If by any chance, however, he Is too

to his Infant majesty as kins; of
the household and pretty much all
the rest of the universe besides.
2Co more the terrible struggle to get
the unruly one before the camera in '
the sacred Interest of the family album.
No more the operator's clownlike
antics to win even a passing smile
from a kicking, bawling, sprawling
atom of humanity. Having "baby's
picture taken" Is now as eirnple as
"painless dentistry." And all because
of the new "baby studio."
The baby studio has suddenly jumped
into being as the most unique and im
portant adjunct of photography. It is
just what Its name Impliesâ* photo
graphic studio given over solely and
exclusively to the children of all ages,
from the wee little tot just able to
crawl to the boy or girl bordering on
the fascinating realm of the "grown
ups." But unlike the studio of the
artist, it is not a place of musty rslics
and ghostly lights â though like your
true artist's favorite workshop, til*
baby studio is Invariably in a wild
state of disorder.
This 1Â« because the baby studio is
nothing; more nor less than a great,
big playroom, with a single window set
aslant in the celling to let in plenty
of light and a floor that is literally
covered with toys of all sorts. The
walls themselves are almost wholly
bidden behind a fresco of pictures that
present to the amazed and delighted
eyes of the â¢ prospective victim of the
photographer's art a perfect kaleido
scope of all the scenes of ancient and
modern fairy lore.
Into this chamber of wonders the in
fant terrible is led fresh from the
scrubbing and brushing of the dress
ing-room and left to get well acquainted
with his new surroundings. Here he
or she may select what fascinates
most and begin an orgle of fun. In the
midst of which the photographer, .con
ceadedjn a big. Innocent- looking book
case, or sideboard, as the case may be,
quietly takes as many pictures as he
deems desirable without the infant
terrible having the slightest Idea that
anything unusual is happening. The
only possible cause for disturbance
usually comes after all the pictures
have been taken and an effort is made
to remove the Infant terrible from the
"At the outset the first step necessary
Is the securin* of their confidence. This
can readily be obtained by displaying a
little tact in approaching them. The
best way Is to take them quietly at the
beginning and avoid plying them with
too many questions if a tendency to
ehyness asserts itself; In fact, , Â¦ It : Is
much better to leave children of
type to .themselves for a time until
they become accustomed to the sur
roundings and the strangeness wears
off. When th* point- Is reached, by
interesting them. with the ?Â£P la Â°?"Â° n
of some new toy or the like their atten
tion will be diverted and the fact of
your presence gradually forgotten or at
' least accepted as a necessary evil.
"The common error made by many
operators. in handling children is that
of approaching them too abruptly. Al
though It takes a little more time at
the commencement, it is far better to
devote a few minutes longer at this
time cultivating your, little sitter and
working him Into the proper frame or
mind necessary for the., rendition of a
pleasing portrait before the camera la
even touched.
> "When a little fellow Â»s brought into
the studio fr^r a sitting we usually
adopt the following method. After the
customary grooming that . Is always
deemed necessary by the anxious nurse
or attendant,- he is ushered Into the
â¢baby studio.' fitted up expressly for his
reception. In this playroom he is al
lowed full swlrg and amuses himself
In" various fashions until we are ready
for his sitting.
"It is among these surroundings that
we first make his acquaintance and as
much time spent with him here as is
considered sufllcient to secure his Inter
est in-what Is promised to follow. Very
little trouble Is experienced with the
majority of subjects after explaining to
them a brief outline of what will be ex
pected of them, to get them to enter in
the full spirit of the undertaking.
"Meanwhile the 'baby studio* has
been prepared, background and accesso
ries placed in readiness and the cam
era, which is closed in to resemble a
bookcase,^stands in position with the
slide drawn. When the young hopeful
is led in but little urging Is required to
get Hm to occupy the space arranged
for If5n; this is usually by a small chair
or table upon which some article liable
to prove of interest is placed in order
to attract his attention.
"Frequently a number of poses can bÂ«
rotten while he la thus amusing him
self and Is auiet for the fraction of
a second required for the exposure.
Mechanical toys interest children great
ly, and by having a good collection on
hand some one of them will particu
larly strike his fancy and be the cause
of calling: forth a variety of expres
sions ranging all the way from a smile
to a yell.
"Once In a while a subject comes
along: who has passed the stage of be
ing attracted by toys; it is then that a
good stock of little stories or the knowl
edge of a few simple tricks will likely
prove of advantage. We have had
youngsters who have put us to our
wits' end In studying up some scheme
in order to arouse them into some de
gree of animation without result, and
then accidentally, before our stock of
patience had entirely left 1 us, stumble
across some- little trifle that we had
previously overlooked, which would
have the effect of arousing them in-
Btajntly Into a being of life and action.
''One little fellow I have In mind, who
gave us a severe tussle after trying
every conceivable object, only gave
signs of possessing an intellect when
his mother happily remembered his
great fondness for pins and supplied
him with a saucerful. It Is needless to
odd that the proofs selected were from
the plate made after the pins ap
peared.
"The question of allowing the friend*
and relatives who frequently accom
pany a child to assemble In the studio
at the time of sitting Is a much dis
cussed one. Whether It is advisable to
let them stay depends entirely on the
people themselves. Sometimes they can
render valuable assistance, but raors
often their presence has the effect of di
viding the child's attention,
"Notwithstanding the many draw
backs and petty annoyances constantly
met with In the portraiture of children.
personally I derive more genuine pleas
ure in photographing these little people
than in all the other branches of the
art combined. Once In a while, after
an unusually trying ordeal with a real
tartar. I am about ready to take part of
this back, but probably the very next
little tot will be a perfect Jewel, and
more than make up for the shortcom

Echoes of Bookdom.
THE sale of novels Is said to ba nota
bly diminishing in France, and . a
Journalist has collected the views of
the leading French publishers upon
tho subject. The publishers agree as to
the fact but differ as to the reason -to
be assigned for It. The market suffers,
we are assured,
"1. Because there are too many novels,
and competing authors cut one another's
throats. - . . â¢-.-,>Â¦Â¦
"2. "Because translations of the works
of Ibsen, Tolstoy ahd Kipling are, for the
moment, more popular in France than tne
home made article. â¢ - . .
-'"3. Because the. French newspapers do
not as a ' rule 1 review novels, but only
print those thinly disguised advertise
ments called /reclames.' ;v
An' interesting feature of the "slump"
Is the fact' that the novels most affected
by ' it arc those usually. Rnd not i alto
gether-, unreasonably, considered .. "im
proper." A survey, however casual, of
the booksellers' windows suggests that in
their case the first reason is the one that
can be most plausibly invoked. .
Aquila Kempster, author of tha new
novel of Hindu mysticism and romance,
"The Mark," was a deserter from an Eng
lish sailing ship In Indian waters, .where
the doctors -had sent him as a youngster
for his health. : He lived seven years In
the native India of 'Kipling, having among
his acquaintances as friend and confidant
a native Prince of royal blood. The novel
is full of the glamour and fascination of
the East and deals convincingly with
matters that Western minds pronounce
impossible. It was one of 587 unsolicited
manuscripts received this season at the
office of his publishers, Doubleday, Page
& Co.. and the first they accepted as
worthy of every effort a publisher
can give for the success of a first' novel
by a new writerâ though there Is not a
semblance In his style to the work of a
beginner. â¢

Stories Worth While.
/N these days of the mushroom
growth of writers and the. tons of
books which pass current as fiction
it is a rare and a precious* boon to read
a story in some new vein. The authors
of. such storles u are few and far be
tween, but such a. one Is. T. Jenkins
Hains, whose book, "The Strife of the
Sea," has lust been published.
"Oh, another sea story!" groans the
bookbuyer as he wearily scans the titles
of the season's latest output. But buy
it, my gentle bibliolater, and you will
be rewarded an hundred fold.
This Is not a. tale of bucko mates and
foretopgallants'ls â Clark Russell^ has
only to write, one more of those, to
damn the brand completely; but It Is
a collection of tales of the things which
live on or In the waters under the
earth. Halns has hereby done for the
pelican, the' ray and the shark v what
Seton Thompson â or Thompson Seton â
did for the four-footed things upon the
earth. With this reservation: that there
are none of those nice little cambric
tea stories about Mamma Bunny and
Baby Cottontail in this book; these are
tales of that struggle for existence
which goes on beneath the water, where
parent forsakes child and brother eats
brother. ',
The quality possessed by Hains' writ
ing does not come from dilettante fish
ing trips or a season's vacation on the
Florida Keys, but from intimate famil
iarity wfth every one of the complex
characteristics of the sea and sea life
gained from long residence thereon, both
as officer of an ocean . greyhound and
master of a private yacht. Long com
munion with the sea fowls and the
finny creatures has given the author a
strong sympathy for them which finds
adequate expression in the stories
which he writes.

IVjL tIclst i can fln^ no comfort in
these days of trusts and steel
kings and sighs for the times when
men trekked through the wilderness of
the Ohio Valley upon a dally diet of
pounded corn and dried venison. Amer
ican chivalry, American bravery has
sped for the author of "The Mississippi
Bubble," and naught remains but the
glutton feast of a gorged nation/ In
"The Way to the West" this teller of
romances lifts up his voice In a glorifi
cation of that departed type of the
American, tbe frontier nation builder
of the West.
Nor does anybody begrudge the long
haired backwoodsman of a century ago
one iota of praise; in fact, we of the
age of submarine boats and nascent
airships have' too soon forgotten the
sturdy men, our grandfathers and
great-grandfathers, who, through
bloody sweat, upbuilt the nation which
now fosters us. Theirs was a work
herculean, imperishable. To them is
due all honor from the Americans of a
twentieth century world power. But
need Mr. Hough bewail the fact so bit
terly that the spirit of our ancestors
is to-day exemplified In a form which
is world reaching? If our grandfathers
fought and conquered the stubborn
forces of one river valley, is there any
shame to us that with the same spirit
diverted into different channels and
aided by more modern conditions we
Americans of to-day are pushing for
ward the boundary of a world's trade?
Despite his lament upon the passing
of the frontiersmen, Mr. , Hough has
done his* idols a great service in put
ting their" history before another gener
ation in /a popular form. The Daniel
Boone of Abbott's old hisjtoriec is . not
going to be 'known to-day. 'The story of
the Western course of empire which
necessitates from three to five volumes
in thetelllng is not going to find general
current in these busy times. The
autHor of "The Way to the West" has
wisely recognized these facts and set
forth a narrative which claims more for
the mode of the telling than for the
multiplicity and chronological correct
ness of the facts recounted.
William R. Llghton, author of a strong
new novel, "Tha , Ultimata Moment,"
which tha Harpers are publishing. Is a
Pennsylvanian, born in Wllllamsport,
whose parents went westward when ha
was a mere boy. Consequently he knows
tha West intimately, and has written
about it thoroughly In articles and in
short stories, of which, as to tbe earlier
ones, ha say. ','1 have them yet, and look
them over now and then when I think
my spirit needs chastening." After an
education chiefly at home. Mr. Lighten
studied law, and was admitted to tha bar.
"I don't know why I did It," ha said re
cently. "Six months of practice gava me
to understand distinctly * that lawlng was
not for me. But there was a vast fund of
'material' In law office and | courtroom,
and at every chanca I tried to get this
material into shape on paper. I drifted
around oven the Far West for a time. In
Kansas, New Mexico, Arizona and Cali
fornia. One winter I tried teaching school
In the heart of the New Mexican desert,
a hundred miles back from nowhere. But
I found that school teaching demanded
genius, and quit it. Then I spent five or
six years in court reporting, enjoying It
immenselyâ not for the work Itself, but
for the matchless opportunity It gave for
studying men and affairs." A direct re
sult- of this experience Is shown In Mr.
Llghton' s virile and sympathetic por

E. F. Benson, author of "The Relentless
City," is known to some of his friends
as "Dodo" Benson, because of his first
story, "Dodo." which, although written
wben he was a young Cambridge gradu
ate, achieved Immediate success and
made Its author famous. In "Tbe j Re*
lentless City." Mr. Benson gives free ex
pression to his opinions of certain phases
of .city life, using New York as a target
for bis clever shafts. The author lives
up to bis convictions and spends most of
his time In the quiet cathedral city of
Winchester, where he has his own bache
lor establishment and runs things as he
likes. His favorite room Is no room at
all. but half of his little garden, with Â¦
roof over It, and the carpet of grass.
Here are books and tables and comfort
able chairs, and even electric lights, so
that he can live almost every hour In the
outdoor air he loves. These are the best
conditions for work that I know." Mr.
Benson said to a friend recently vlsitlns

DR. HERBERT ' M. HOPKINS,
erstwhile Instructor of Latin at
the University of California and
recently budding novelist, lays biint
eelf open to the charge <nT vtnvdlc
tiveness by his latest book. /The
Torch.** For through the med'tam ct
a novel Dr. Hopkins has manifestly en
deavored to ~get back aÂ£" President
Benjamin Ide Wheeler of the State Uni
versity for the real or fÂ»nHÂ»rt trrang
which he suffered at that gentleman's
hands while a' member of the teaching
staff at Berkeley. An out and V out
polemic upon the state of . things as
they are, or as Dr. Hopkins sees* taem
at Berkeley, would not have found a
publisher, but glazed over under the
guise of a novel. Dr. Hopkins has suc
ceeded in getting his opinions into
print.
Much â¢ as we may take exception to
the author's display of bad taste, it
must be admitted that 1#; has written
a college story which will be widely
read. For he strikes an entirely ' new
note in that class of fiction, in that he
deals with the faculty side of the. col
legiate world and ehows us that there
is much more to the college professor's
life than what is displayed in his class
rooms. His story deals with the "in
side" of college politics and will be of
interest to college men of California,
especially on account of the thinly dis
guised recountal of some recent hap
penings, both at the University of Cali
fornia and Stanford. - " â¢ .
The scene of Hopkins* novel is laid at
a Western' university situated . at
"Argos," whose colors, are green and
gold, and whose college yell is not un*
familiar to football enthusiasts who
witness the games out on Richmond
Field. The story opens with the re
tirement of an old president and the
coming from the East of one, Babing
ton, to take up the reins of govern
ment. With the advent of. new blood
there is a general upheaval among the
somewhat antiquated members of the
teaching force and many bitter Jeal
ousies and heart-burnings are the re
sult.
The new president's vigorous meas
ures cause so much internal dissension
that finally something very like the un
fortunate Ross incident at Stanford en
sues and there is a general crash, fol
lowed by an intense gloom. The rather
lame and halting thread of- -romance
which is woven about a beautiful wi
dow of the college community hardly
serves to illumine the grand wreck
which signalizes the ending of the tale.
Were one to take the story at its worth
without reading between the lines, the
undeniable references to facts which
the author would have his reader be
lieve to be extant In the college across
the bay, "The Torch" could be consid
ered a good story. It has a strong
swing to it and some well-worked situ
ations. It reveals a litt!e-known phase
of academic life In a convincing man
ner.
But friends of the "University of Ar
gos" will scarcely be convinced that the
torch Is laid to that fruitful tree in 'ao
certain a destruction as Dr. Hopkins
seems to see. In that one great family
over In Berkeley there may be rules for
Its discipline which are beyond the ken
of the erstwhile instructor of Latin. Â«, \

"Again I hear the reader ask. 'Who
are our pessimists?' " vociferates the
young socialist In his plea; and he an
swers: "They are the pulsating life
cells of our nation. Its flesh, bones and
einews. They are those who know not
and know not that they know not. They
contend and find fault (and rightly so)
with existing conditions. They are pes
simists, who. if they had the brains of
bur optimists, would sustain, renovate
and advance with healthy,stlmulus the
prosperity of the nation. While wish
ing to recreate they ignorantly destroy.
Our anarchists, socialists and labor
leaders, with the great masses which
they represent, are the component parts
of that great tidal wave of humanity
which a few of our talented observers
have already taken notice of and class
ified as the 'coming terror.* "
Needless to say that this remarkable
monosrapb by London served only to
mystify the callow intellects of its high
school 'readers and confirm their sus
pk-Jor;s of his anarchical tendencies.
Fallacious as his arguments might have
beer, there was a strength to that lit
tle TK3J- which in the lipht of later
developments can be considered as the
Etraw which pointed the wind.
That was the single occasion, how
ever, on which London sought to lead
his schoolmates out of the wilderness.
His nert Aegis publication was much
more subdued, being a little Japanese
sketch under the caption, "Sakaicho,
Hona Asi and Hakadaki." a simple lit
tle thing, pitched In a minor chord.
Then followed "A Night's Swim In
Teddo Bay," the recountal of a rollick
ins lark on the part of the author while
with his chip In Japanese waters.
A sea sketch called "The Hun
Across." and another "Frisco Kid",
story, neither of extraordinary merit,
next appeared in the Aegis. These were
followed by two stories, written Just
before London left high school for- a
brief six months at the university and
then Alaska. "Who Believes / In
Ghosts" and "One More Unfortunate"
were the titles of these two stories,' the
best of his high school writings and
very stronir indications of what was
to come when the frozen north had
A strange fellow was that young
sailor trampâ for tramp he had also
been before he came to the high school.
With his salient Jaw sticking out over
a gray eweater, his rumpled hair and
gray eyes, sparkling Eometimes almost
to savagery, he was not a fellow to in
vite a confidence from the younger
boys, his schoolmates, and consequent
ly he was looked upon with a respectful
awe by his associates. Some even called
him an anarchist; this because he used
to go down to the City Hall Square on
Saturday nights and harangue the
laboring men and loafers upon the
tenets of socialism.
In fact London could not refrain from
voicing his sentiments on that question
to his schoolmates. In the Aegis of
March 1, '95, there appeared under his

"Pessimism, Optimism and Patriot-

That was before Josiah Flynt had
written his tramp stories. "Frisco Kid"
was in a new vein so far as the lim
ited circle of a typical high school boy's
knowledge of books carried him. This
little story by young London, with its
sudden dash into a terra incognita, its
fanciful diction and clear-cut pathos,
co different from the usual waterfall
type of a "sad etory," broke down all
barriers, and London was tacitly ac

Blory- telling lever would out sev
eral years before it began to assume a
readable form. Again, like the English
author, London's first attempts at tell
ing a taJe were given to the narrow
world of a school paper circulation.
The first published literary effort of
Jack London appeared in the Oak
land High School Aegis of the date of
January IS. 1S95. It was entitled
â¢"Benin Island, an Incident of the Seal
ing Fleet of '93." and was made the
leading article of the school periodical
by the enthusiastic school-boy editor.
A typical school boy's article was this.
It began:
"How many beautiful, unfrequented
epots there are that are practically
unknown and unheard of; unknown
and unheard of, not only by that great
cJass, the stay-at-home people, but by
the wandering sightseer.

This piece of descriptive writingâ all

previously. But it was so far superior
t<> the usual hodge-podge of youthful

these columns had the honor to be a
humble member, gravely gathered in
conclave and discussed the merits of
this rough sailor, who had suddenly ap
peared to snatch the laurel buds from
tin- youthful brows of aspiring genius.
Hut London would not down. . In the
next issue of the Aegis there appeared
a more aspiring piece â "Frisco Kid's
Story." It was a dialect story, couched
In the vernacular of the hobo. Through
the monologue of "Frisco Kid" there
was narrated the simple little story of
a youth from a mansion in the city who
had strayed away with tramps and
finally met his death while still of their
number.

"Stand back!" cried the mate, whose
outraged sfenseof discipline was even
stronger than his interest at the news!

"They are dead men!" cried the ca>
taln. "A shout all together, boys, 'to
warn them of their danger."
V But It was too late.
\At , that very moment the dingey
shot Into the shadow of the fishing
boÂ»t. There were two rapid pistol
shots, a scream, and then another pistol
shot, followed by silence. The cluster
ing had disappeared. And
them, suddenly -as the. first puffs of a
land breeze came out from the Sussex
shore -tBfe boom swung out, the main
sail filled., and. the little craft crept out
with her nose to the Atlantic
"When I last saw him his Excellency
was In bed with his throat cut. When I
broke prison I learnt from my friendsâ
for Captain . Sharkey has those who
love him In every portâ that the Gov
ernor was .starting for Europe under
a master who had never seen him. I
climbed his veranda and I paid him
the little debt that I owed him. Then
I came aboard you with such, of his
things as I had need of, and a pair of
glasses to hide these telltale eyes of
mine, and I have ruffled It as a Gov
ernor should. Now, Ned, you can get
to work upon them."
"Help! Help! Watch ahoy!" yelled
the mate: but the butt of the pirate's
pistol crashed down on his head,
and he dropped like a struck ox.
Scarrow rushed for the door, but the
sentinel clapped his hand over his
mouth, and threw his other arm around
his waist.
"No use. Master Scarrow," said
Sharkey. â¢ "Let us sea you go down on
your knees and beg for your life."
"I'll see you " cried Scarrow,
shaking his mouth clear.
"Twist his arm round. Ned. Now
will you?"
"No; not If you twist it off."
"Put an Inch of your knife Into him."
"You may put six inches, and then I
won't.'/ *
"Sink me, but I like the spirit!" cried
Sharkey. "Put your knife in your
pocket, Ned. You've saved your skin.
Scarrow, and It's a pity so stout, a man
should not take to the only trade
where a pretty fellow can pick up a
living. You must be born for no com
mon death, Scarrow, since you have
lain at my mercy and lived to tell the
story. Tie nim up, Ned."
"To the stove, captain?"
"Tut, tut! there's a fire In the stove.
None of your rover tricks, Ned Gal
loway, unless they are called for, or
I'll let you know which of us two Is
captain and which is quartermaster.
Make him fast to the table."
' "Nay, I thought you meant to roast
him!" said the quartermaster. "You
surely do not mean to let him go?"
"If you and I were marooned on a
Bahama cay, Ned Galloway. It Is still
for me to command and for you to
obey. Sink you for a villain, do you
dare to question my orders?"
"Nay, nay. Captain Sharkey, not so
hot. sir!" said the quartermaster, and,
lifting Scarrow like a child, he laid him
on the table. With the quick dexterity
of a seaman, he tied his spreadeagled
hands and feet with a rope which waa
passed underneath, and gagged him
securely with the long cravat which
used to adorn the chin of the Governor
Of St. Kltts.
"Now, Captain Scarrow. we must
take our leave of you," said the pirate.
"If I had half a dozen of my brisk boys
at my heels I should have had your
cargo and your ship, but Roaring Ned
could not find a foremast hand with the
spirit of a mouse. I see there are some
small craft about, and we shall get one
of them. When Captain Sharkey has
a boat he can get a smack, when ha
has a smack he can get a brig, when he
has a brig he can get a bark, and when
he has a bark he'll soon have a full
rigged ship of his own â so make hasta
into London town or I may be coming
back, after all, for the Morning Star."
Captain Scarrow heard the key turn
in the lock as they left the cabin. Then
as he strained at his bonds, he heard
their footsteps pass up the companion
and along the quarter deck to where
the dingey hung in the stern. Then,
still struggling and writhing, he heard
the creak of the falls and the splash
of the boat in the water. In a mad
fury he tore, and dragged at his ropes.
until at last, with flayed wrista and
ankles, he rolled from the table, sprang
over the dead mate, kicked his way
through the closed door, and rushed
hatless on to the deck.
"Ahoy! Peterson. Armitage. Wilson!
he screamed. "Cutlasses and pistols.
Clear away, the long boat! Clear away
the gig! Sharkey. the pirate, is in yon
der dingey.* Whistle up the larboard
watch, bo'sun. and tuir.ble into the
boats all hands."
Down splashed the long boat and
down splas'aed the gig. but in an in
stant the coxswains and crews were
swarming up the falls on to the deck
once more. â¢
;'.'The boats are scuttled!' they cried.
"They are leaking: H*e a sieve."
i The captain gave a bitter curse. He
had been beaten and outwitted at every
point. Above was a cloudless, starlit
sky with neither wind nor the pro
mise of it. The sails flapped idly In
the moonlight. Far away lay a fishing
smack, with the men clustering over
thelr.net.
i Close to them was the little dingey,
dipping Â¦ and lifting over the shining
swell. .
Captain Scarrow, "you have not play
ed out the hand, and we are not the
losers."
"Sink you for a liar." Said'the Gov
ernor. "I tell you that I have played
out the hand and that you are a loser."
He whipped off his wls and his glasses
as he spoke, and there was a high, bald
forehead and a pair of shifty blue eyes
with the red rims of a bull terrier.
"Good God!" orled the mate. "It's
Sharkey!"
The two sailors sprang: from their
seats, but the big American castaway
had put his huge back against the
cabin door and he held a pistol In each
of his hands. The passenger had also
laid a pistol upon the scattered cards
in front of him, and he burst into his
high, neighing laugh.
"Captain Sharkey is the name, ren
tlexnen," said he, "and this Is Roaring
Ned Galloway, the quartermaster of
the Happy Delivery. We made It hot.
so they marooned us; me on a dry Tor
tuga car, and him In an earless boat.
You dogÂ»â you poor, fond, water-heart
ed dogs â we hold you at the end of our
pistols."
"You inay shoot or you may not!"
cried . Scarrow, striking his hand upon
the breast of his frieze Jacket. "If it's
my last breath, Sharkey, I tell you that
you are a bloody rogue and miscreant,
with a halter and hell fire in store for
you!"
"There's a man of spirit, and one of
my own kidney, and he's going to make
a very pretty death of It!" cried
Sharkey. "There's no one aft save the
man at the wheel, so you may kee?
your breath, for you'll need It soon.
Is the dingey astern. Ned?**
"Ay, ay, captain I"
"And the other boats souttledr* !
"I bored them all In three places."
"Then we shall have to leave you.
Captain Scarrow. You look as if you
hadn't quite got your bearings yet. la
there anything you'd like to ask me?**
"I believe you're the devil himself I**
cried the captain. "Where Is the Gov
ernor of St. Kltts?"
TEpV SUNDAY Â¦ CAIiL.
(Cortyrtght by A. Conan Doyle.)
_____ ' â¢
WHEN the great wars of the
Spanish Succession had been
brought to an end by the
Treaty of Utrecht, the vast
number of privateers which
had been fitted out by, the contending:
parties found their occupation gone.
Some took to the more peaceful bu*.
less lucrative ways of ordinary' com
merce, others were absorbed Into the
fishing fleets and a few of the more
reckless hoisted the Jolly Rodger at the
mizzen and the bloody flag at the main,
declaring a private war upon their own ,
account against the whole human race.
With mixed crews, recruited from
every nation, they scoured the seas,
disappearing occasionally to careen in
some lonely inlet, or putting in for a
debauch at some outlying port, where
they dazzled the inhabitants by their
lavishness and horrified them by their
brutalities. It took a stout seaman in
those days to ply his calling in the Ca
ribbean Gulf.
Euch a man was Captain John Scar
row of the ship Morning Star, and yet
he breathed a long sigh of relief when
he heard the sr>lash of the falling
anchor and swung at his moorings
within a hundred yards of the guns of
the citadel of Basseterre. St. Kltts was
his final port of call, and early next
morning his bowsprit would be pointed
for old England. He had had enough
of those robber-haunted seas. Ever
eince he had left Maracalbo upon the
Main, with his full lading of EUgar and
red pepper, he had winced at every top
sail which glimmered over. the violet
edge of the tropical sea.
Captain Sharkey of the twenty-gun
pirate barque, Happy Delivery, had
passed down the coast and had littered
It with gutted vessels and with mur
dered men. Dreadful anecdotes were
current of his grim pleasantries and of
his Inflexible ferocity. From the Ba
hamas to the Main his coal black
barque, with the ambiguous name, had
been freighted with death and many
things which are worse than death. So
nervous was Captain Scarrow, with his
new full-rigged ehip and her full and
valuable lading that he struck out to
the west as far as Bird's Island to be
out of the usual track of commerce.
___. yet even In those solitary- waters
he had been unable to shake off sinister
traces of Captain Sharkey.
One morning they had raised a single
skiff adrift upon the face of the ocean.
Its only occupant was a delirious sea
â¢Â»", who * yelled hoarsely as _ they
hoisted him aboard, and showed a
dried-up tongue like a black and wrink
led fungus at the back of his mouth.
'YÂ£_ter and nursing soon transformed
him Into the strongest and smartest
sailor on the ship. He was from Mar
blehead. In New England,-. It seemed,
and the sole survivor of a schooner
which had been scuttled by the dread
ful Eharkey.'"' "" * ..','.Â¦ 7\ ' - .
Now that they lay under the guns of
Basseterre, all danger from the pirate
was. at an end and yet the thought of
him lay heavily upon the seaman's
mind as he watched the agent's boat
shooting out from the Custom house
<juay. . ~ ,
"I'll lay you a wager. Morgan,** said
he to the first ' mate, "that the agent
will speak of- Sharkey in -the first hun
dred words that 5 pass his lips."
"Well, captain,. Til. have you a silver
dollar and rchance.lt,"" said the rough
old Bristol man beside him. â¢
The negro . rower.s shot . the boat
s alongside and the linen-clad steersman
spring up the ladder. .
"Welcome, ,, Captain .Scarrow!"' he
cried. "Have you heard about Shar
key?" : ; . ,^v '<;/
The captain grinned at the ; t mate. â¢
"What deviltry has he been up to
now?" he asked. , .
"Deviltry !- You've not heard, then!
Why, we've cot ; him safe under lock
and key. here . at Basseterre. He was
tried last, Wednesday, and he is to be
hanged to-morrow morning." *
Captain and mate gave a shout of joy,
which an instant later was taken up
by the crew. Discipline was forgotten
as they scrambled up" through the break
of the poop* to hear the "news. â¢ The New
EngrJander was in . the front of them
with a 'radiant face turned up to
heaven, for he came of the Puritan
stock.
"Sharkey to be hanged!" he cried.
*Tou don't know. Master Agent, if they
lack a hangman, do you?"
.'The voyage of the Morning Star was

great success. ' He was good for a large
touch ,to any deserving charity that
published the, names of its 'unselfish
benefactors in the newspapers and he
was the founder of the Goldbonds Hos
pital ! for the Prevention of Privacy to
'the Poor. In order that there might
not be any mistake about it he had his
name carved on the front In letters
that loomed " up after the 'Â¦ manner of 1 a

strike in one of the plants that he was
Interested In he would talk big about
the sanctity of vested interests and the
necessity of' leaving the - conduct of
great enterprises to the i men to whom
Morgan . had intrusted it. ..
Being so public-spirited and constant
In : all good works that the newspapers
were: likely' to' hear about, it was natu
ral* that" 1 he should sooner, or 'later turn
his attention to the conduct of .the af
fairs of the clty>whlch.he favored with
his residence. When. he raised' his eyes
from the gliding, ticker-tape one day to
consider the cdndltlon v of.^the politics
of the city he was shocked at the sight
that met his gaze. â¢ Men were actually
making moneys out '. of the city; and
men, too, who were being paid to ad
minister the affairs. of their offices for
the good of the people. .Shocking!/ Mr.
Goldbonds inquired of the, atmosphere
in his vicinity^lf he were right in his
idea that this was a free country. ' No
one could tell him positively, but a
few hazarded the oplnion'itnat it was
so considered, or had been at one time.
The farther Mr. Goldbonds looked the
more his gentle { soul was" pained. * *
â¢'In burning accents Mr." Goldbonds an-'
nounced his intention of redeeming the
'city.S from; the 1 clutch of evil and giving
It "* over ; to â¢ the â¢ care of men' who were
endowed by nature and the social regis

people's business better than they could
Of course, the girl who dotes on put
tering about with a popper and pan
piled high with .corn and apples Is only
another kind ,of a temptation. She
plays the part of a spoiled child to per

'She'""pushes """back'" her "'chair'"" as'" a

down on the* floor, but she manages to
find a spot where the flames will throw
fitful shadows on her face, and then
when everything: Is arranged to -her
complete satisfaction, she devotes her
self to the bursting of the brown ker
nels Into 'the snowy flakes with all the
enthusiasm of a youngster," and v her
merry voice and gleeful manner fill the
room with good humor and high spirits.
Yet with all her pranks and childish In

permits the faintest trace of flippancy
to creep In to undo her deadly work.

before the onlookers are quite certain
what has happened to them. .
To- be sure, greens, that is, of the
right kind and grown . especially for
decorative purposes, are not to be
found on one's back porch, nor yet
withing : a ; stone's throw of the house.
The very: best, one can do takes at
least fifteen minutes hard olimbing, an
hour or more of resting under a shady
tree, and a few seconds quick picking.
But somehow or other the time has a
queer way of slipping by, as though a
bit of magic were employed, and when
they; do . get back . the f. merry . : waiters
have disappeared 'over the brow Â¦ of . the
hill on horseback. ... So; the day is won
withv all hands dewn.* â¢ ' f >- r :-
And that's the first Inning. Put
ting the thought in his head without
his even suspecting it is going a long
way toward success, ; for - she I knows
that the rest is but a matter of time,
for he has virtually signed away . his
freedom and Is a doomed roan.v:.\. l ;
But she doesn't stop there. When she
Is quite certain that he is comfortable,
she sets to work â¢ to entertain him.
And this she finds so rldicuously easy,
for it Is one of the first steps In her
little act to make it her business to dis
cover what his Interests and hobbles
are, and then all Is plain sailing. One
thing leads to another and the next he
knows the thought will flit through his
brain that she is one of the brightest
girls he has ever known and he will find
himself seeking her again and again,
and of course, always in the cause of
the one absorbing topic.
It Is' so perfectly natural to grow seri
ous now and then and use a voice low
and vibrant that was made for the ex
press purpose ... of â. making . > tho blood
tingle through Â¦ the ' veins Â¦' of â¢ any Â¦ man
not carved out of stone. she
knows i that â¢ the Rubtlle of j a
soft,* sweet- voice - casts a- spell that'
rivals the glow of the hearth and that
when the two are combined' the man' a
caso f is practically hopeless.
And so it is with this girl. By doing
for her guest she wins his heart and he
inwardly wonders how it was he hadn't
noticed how handy she was about the
house, and as he sinks further Into the
great chair With a contented sigh, he
vaguely dreams of a home of his own;
a hearth of his own and a wife to grace
it. .- ,-â¢>.-Â¦.:
here was the domestic wife for him,
and the rich chap settled back with a
smile as he thought how easy it would
be to bowl her father over. â¢
And isn't It queer .h'sfw much helping
up and helping down that la*dder is
positively necessary, and how thought
ful and kind It is for the fellow (*n the
substantial hearth to keep one hand
busy holding the lady fair so that
there might be no danger of her falling,
handing up branches with the other
one. and taking desperate chances of
having the hammer hit him squarely
on the head every minute? And in the
midst of all this, he actually finds time
to send up a perfect volley of speech
less messages and actually counts him
self the luckiest fellow in all Christen
dom.
But then he is rewarded, so what's
the difference? So far as he is con
cerned he is perfectly blissful, and. be
it said to his credit, such an idea
never entered his head, but after hav
ing gone so far, Miladi wants to come
in at the finish with flying colors and
she nonchalantly unfolds another little
scheme that she has kept carefully hid
den up her sleeve.
Nearly every man under the heavens
prides himself on being a fine cook and
openly boasts that he can make bet
ter coffee than any other fellow that
ever was born. So she tickles his
vanity and suggests that he take *Â»
turn at it, but at the same time 'she
tÂ£kes precious good care to. peep Into
the larger and see that It is well filled
dainties that might prove more
tempting and more appetizing.
She does the measuring, laughing all
the while and asking his advice, and
then he is permitted the questionable
pleasure of doing all the stirring and
watching to see that the' pot doesn't
boil over. And sometimes. If she Is
overly bold, she even goes so far as
to sit back and watch the proceedings
with all the indulgence of a mother,
even going so far as to let him bring his
wonderful concoctions to a wee table
â¢that she has prepared under his ad
miring eyes.
There is something tremendously fas
cinating and- cozy about sitting down
to a table set for a sufficient two and
to have the face that smiles over the
coffee urn : the one that haunts your
fancy both early and late. Somehow
It seems to have the faculty. of setting
the mind to work, and making the
bachelor lorn get a- bee. In his bonnet,
the very worst kind of a way to have
a home of his own and to repeat the
same preformance three times a day. .
. And when; that bee Is' once lodged
firmly It is just about the most obstin
ate thing on earth to loose. There Is
no casting it aside or, throwing it away
for It bobs up serenely with renewed
vigor until the only ..thing that Is left to
do is to humor It to have any peace of
mind, and I then t the fireside '.. girl's
victory is complete. .
The grafters, were down and out and
civic virtue sat enthroned with its halo
adjusted at the proper angle and a
fountain pen behind Its ear to begin
work when the whistle bleuv For a few
weeks all went merry as the. bell on the
cash register of an all-night saloon.
The sun rose and then set. as usual,
and the average citizen â non-union â
did his ten hours' work for five hours'
pay and paid his taxes and dodged the
imminent deadly automobile pretty
much as before. But it happened that
in the hurry of the campaign Mr. Gold
bonds had allowed one or two men to
slip into important offices whose rec
ords he had not had time to Inspect
as carefully as he should have liked.
Now, some of these men had very pe
culiar ideas about the duties which
they owed to the city. To Mr. Gold
bonds' surprise and horror they were
actually of the opinion that a man who
paid $10,000 a year In taxes when he
owned only $25,000 was as much under
the stern eye of the law as the miser
able criminal who ran a policy shop
in the back room of a cigar store, and
sometimes made as much as {17 a
week. This was a condition of affairs
that he had not bargained for. and he
was a good Judge of bargains, too.
These bigoted Individuals had the au
dacity to suggest that the street car
company, which had for years been al
lowing the city to maintain streets
along its right of way, and had never
crammed more than twice as many
people into its cars as they were In
tended to hold, should pay back taxes
on their " franchises and take their
tracks off the city property or submit
to the degrading alternative of a law
suit. Also they announced that tho
wholesale merchants should not be al
lowed to add to their warehouse room
by utilizing the sidewalks for storage
purposes; and this. In spite of the fact
that the merchants were willing to let
the public walk on the curb, provided
they didn't tip any of the boxes over.
Mr. Goldbonds called on the Mayor
In hot haste and demanded to know
what he meant by Infringing on the lib
erties of the men who had -shed their
coats and their coin to secure his eiec
tlon. That ungrateful creature cave
him a cutting look and the chilly in
formation that the laws were made for
all alike, without regard to race, color.
or size of campaign contributions, in
vain did Mr. Goldbonda point out to
the Mayor that he was elected to carry
out the laws against gambling ana
other unincorporated enterprises, and
that it was not intended that reputable
business men and faithful church mem
bers should be made to change their
way of doing business. His areumtnt
was wasted, and he left the City Hall
wildly crying out that personal liberty
had been done to death in the house
of- its friends, and that the days of
despotism and unprofitable business
had returned. In hia humbly opinion
i the bird oÂ£ freedom-same o d b:rd to
which reference has been made before
had received a Jolt from which it wou.d
" be long in recovering.
Nothing could be done with the ob
durate officers who sat In places Â«.
power, but when the next campaign
rolled round Mr. Goldbonds could r>e
distinctly discerned sitting on the
other side. of the house, und his clerks
were working overtime mallimr cam
paign contributions to the chief corrun
tlonist. The other fellows mjeht be
grafters, but he knew how to talk with
them. The result was that the reform
candidates for re-election* were buried
so deep that nothing less than a steam
dredge could find even the faintest
traces of them. If ! you ask Mr. Gold
bonds about it he will probably tell
you "that he has learned that while
> politics may make strange bedfellows,
'the man who understands hts business
can get a berth all to himself, if he has
the price. He has also learned that the
way of reform is often hardâ on the re
former, if he happens to be interested
In some other business at the same
time
Â¦ Â¦'Â¦Â» '
manage their own. u glowing terms
he described the superlative political
qualities of the man whom his party
had nominated for Mayor â a man, as
he feelingly remarked, who had not
only won all the prizes cCexed for
Greek composition while he was In col
lege, but had also given the city one
of the best Sunday .schools that it had
ever seen. â¢ He promised, if his man
were elected, that no more would tne
shameful sight be seen of little chil
dren of tender years tolling wearily up
four 'flights of stairs three times a day
With the battered. old family growler;
grasping real estate agents should be
compelled to furnish a nice new can
with each and- every lease and a dumb
waiter should be Installed in all the
tenement houses.
In eloquent words Mr. Goldbond3 de
clared: "The! eyes of the world and
of Dr. Parkhurst are upon us and com
mon- prudence demands that we be
good." He was also of the opinion that
democratic government was on trial
and unless the city showed its ability
to rid itself of corruption In high
places It was all up with the govern
ment aforesaid. Of course, j democ
racy has been' on trial a good many
times In the. course of its life and has
usually managed to secure another
hearing on appeal or a certificate of
reasonable doubt, but Mr. Goldbonfia
was compaigning and we must not bo
too critical. If all Tnen were compelled
to stick close to- the truth In their
campaign- orations there would be
fewer speeches and much less fun for
the unregenerate.
By a strange freak of fortune it
turned out that the man for .whom our
friend Goldbonds was working was
pushed into the Mayor's chair by so
tight a squeeze that he scraped all th*
buttons off his overcoat as he went
through. But he got In and .the bird or
freedom preened his feathers and
screamed once or twice to show that h<Â»
was still doing business at the old
stand. Ttfr. Goldbonda modestly ad
mitted that he was the principal cause
of the victory and that if it hadn't been
for his strenuous efforts in behalf of
good - government * the poor old bird
aforesaid would have been on the mnt
â¢with, the grafters sitting on his wish
bone. Incidentally, he managed to slip
a trust { or . . two \ of doubtful color
through the lines "under cover of the
smoke* of the flnaf guns of . the cam
paign, safd guns having been fired by
himself.

THE ETIQUETTE
OF THE
FIRESIDE GIRLBy Martha M. Williams.
MARGY'S FAIRY
PRINCE
How to give your winter hat
tbe one deft touch, that will turn
it into a piece of fashionable
headgear â All kinds of fur wili
be worn as hat trimmings â A
very pretty hat and boa in the
trousseau of Mrs. T. C. Platt â
The new belts and tie new
stocks. *
HERE are email hats on the mar-
I ket, but they are so scarce that
j It Is difficult to find them.
I In t spite of the fact that the
-^ large' hat Is hard to keep on the
head, notwithstanding the circumstance
that it catches the wind, the dust and
the wreckage of winter, and that It is
expensive to buy and worse to trim.
the large hat Is the hat of this winter.
The Inner solution can be discovered
In the statement that it is becoming
to woman, and with Xhls knowledge
nestling in her mind the woman who
wants a new hat goes out and buys a
big one. * r
And they trim big hats so temptingly
thrse days that it is no wonder that
women cannot pass them by. Who can
wist the seductions of a large black
hat, exquisitely soft, with its made
velvet brim and its tall square, soft
crown. And who c&n pass by the great
beaver-like felts, with their really mar
velous feather and ribbon trimminss?
From the edge of one light colored
hat hung a beautiful silky fringe which
fell over the hair, taking the place of
the lace of last summer. Another hat
was bordered with a little rim of lace
cut out of cloth, one of those cut-out
cloth patterns which are so much used
for applique and for trimmings.
Another hat was trimmed as to the
edge with a little niching of soft chif
fon with one of mallne underneath,
and still another had a little border of
the smallest ostrich feathers that ever
came off a baby bird.
"With. their multitudinous chances for
effective trimmings It Is not to be won
dered at that the big hat. or picture
hat. holds its romance: and that it is
dearer to the heart and fancy of woman
than the severe little toque. Yet there
are many toques to be seen also.
BT ATJGUSTA PBESCOTT.
A great many hats are trimmed with
bands of fur which are put around .the
crown In ribbon fashion. A strip of
sable three inches wide and five-eighths
of a yard long will make, a very hand
some band for a tall crowned hat. Mon
key skin and mole skin are used in the
same way and the finer grades of Per
sian lamb. The band of fur constitutes
all the trimming required for the hat,
except, perhaps, a bunch of bright, red
roses which are fastened at the side,
nestling right in the deptns of the fur.
Fur tails are used upon hats and a
little border of tails makes a pretty
edging for a hat brim. They are tacked
to the rim of the hat and they make a
very becoming border for the face.
Fur is very becoming in all Its vari
eties, and It sets off the face . beautiful
ly, for it gives that touch of winter
piquancy and softness which is so es
sential to prettiness.
And delightfully "fit" a fur hat,al
ways looks, for It is so unquestionably
seasonable and so , undoubtedly appro
priate that there Is never any question
regarding it Because It is appropriate,
as well as for many other reasons.* the
woman who can get enough fur to trim
her hat is bringing It out and using it
as a winter trimming.
One of the prettiest of the new hats
Pretty Wintry Ideas.
Mrs. Thomas C. Platt, an October
bride, has a very beautiful fur set in
her trousseau, consisting of an ex
quisite ermine stole with hat to match.
The stole is very wide and is thrown
around the neck. The ends hang down
the front, and are so wide as almost
to cover the entire front breadth of
the gown. They gradually widen to
the knees, where they are finished with
a very deep niching of chiffon.
This lovely ermine stole is trimmed
with three very narrow bands of sable,
while a handsome sable head fastens
the stole at the throat. The hat is a
wide brimmed one, bordered with er
mine.
As the new millinery runs you can
use any kind of fur upon your hat and
In almost any sort of way.
A very becoming hat with spreading
brim and low crown is trimmed as to
the crown with a piece of sealskin. The
crown is entirely covered with it. and
the piece required is a circular bit of
Fkin about twice or three times the size
of the palm of your hand. It. Is placed
smoothly over the crown and there is
no other scrap of fur upon the hat.
And queer it Is In the lingers of an
amateur. But, taken in hand by one
who is practiced in handling It, great
results can be obtained.
Everybody knows how difficult fur
Is as a millinery proposition. As the
salesgirl at the fur counter said to a
customer: "We sell these ermine bands
for trimming hats. But, really, mad
ame, you will have to take the hat to
a milliner to be trimmed. You will
rot be able to handle the fur yourself.
Fur is so queer!"
Velvet hate with their crowns irar
landed with little pink roses are given
a seasonable touch by the addition of
tiny feather tips, set between the roses
and so arranged that they fall forward
over them.
The Lady, and the Fur Hat.
Quills, wings and all the little stiff
feather ornaments that appear on
the counters every spring In wide ar
ray are seen this late fall ready for the
occupancy of the winter hat.
And so it is with the gay colors this
season; for the colors that bloom in
the spring and die In the fall have
remained popular this winter; and the
millinery departments look more like
Easter displays than like the fall and
winter openings.
Particularly is the use' of flowers no
ticeable; and you see countless hats
of felt and of velvet trimmed with a
nice little border of small pink rose
buds, which are arranged around the
crown so that they touch each other,
affording the only trimming that is
needed by the hat.
A great many economical and clever
dressers now take their last summer's
hats and remodel them for winter sim
ply by removing the roses and the silk
and replacing them upon'felt hats for
winter wear. True, the style has
chanpf-d a little and the arrangement
is slightly different, but the same trim
mings will do.
A great many handsome hats are
trimmed with bunches of pink roses,
and among these are the rough felts,
which netd no other trimming than
the roses which are. massed upon one
side in a great bank of color.
There la an undeniable fancy this
season for treating a felt hat precisely
as though it were a hat of straw. A
beautiful round soft rough felt, in a
shade of ecru, with the shag at least
half an inch long, looking like the
back of a baby grizzly bear, was
adorned with stiff quills.
Another hat, a beaver felt, with a
square crown of medium height, was
also trimmed with quills. Right at
the back the hat was turned up and
fastened with a long scarlet wing. On
top of the hat there was a little scar
let silk trimming all laid flat on the
hat. And under the wide brim there
was a w, lde scarlet wing spread out and
sewed flat.

The new stocks and belts possess the
distinguishing characteristic of being
novel. They are realy and truly dif
ferent from any ever seen before, and.
marvelous ' to relate, they are less ex
pensive than you expect to find them.
â¢The most fashionable belts. Just at
tile . moment, are made of skin of one
kind or another. The very wide suede
belt, which is crushed down around the
figure, and which fastens ; with > a bis
leather buckle in front, is one of the
best of belts, and, as it comes in a
great variety of colors, oni can al
ways find, something to suit.
But a more spectacular belt is the
calfskin belt, with the hair left on.
A. belt fit this kind was about three
Inches wide in . the back, tapering a
little toward the. front, where it fas
tened with a little round brass, buckle.
The color was a reddish brown, a regu
lar calf color, with white places upon
it. The hair was short and if rubbed
the right way felt very silky.
A calfskin siS>ck was covered with
reddish brown hair on one side, while
the other side was covered with whitÂ©
hairâ just as the spots came upon the
calf â and this presented a curious "aD
pearance. for it looked like two stocks
viewed from different sides. This was
buckled in front under a brass buckle.
A very neat belt is the pigskin belt,
and there are all the crushable kid
belts of the year, dyed in red and green,
brown and black.
. The popular taste runs just at pres
ent toward the belt which must be
crushed down in the back, for it is
too wide to fit the waist. The front is
cut tapering. This belt is hooked
around the waist,; is fastened low in
front, and is pushed down as far as
possible, for the low front is still the
vogue. The back and sides/ take on
little natural wrinkles until a waist
is formed. It is Important to put the
belt on carefully the first time., for
the creases will remain Just as they
wer> at first.
The stocks are departing from their
simplicity, for they show the oddest of
features. Many are partly fur. and
there are stocks that are made of silk,
while a velvet strap goes over the silk
and hooks in front.
The Armenian belts and stocks are
wonderfuly conspicuous, for they con
sist of linen embroidered in many col
ors. Some of them are. as^'vivid as
gorgeous silks cÂ«n make them, and" are
carried out with a degree of native
fidelity that is surprising. The em
broidering of a handsome belt makes
a fascinating piece of fancy work, and

a little of the green's popularity lost

popular. Ked in all its phases is fash
ionable, from the red which makes ihe

is automobile red, which is the most

many street dresses are built of it, doz

the fancy dress i'awn party to be given
at St. Chrysostom's for the benefit of

quite a stretch of turf and shrubbery
available. Therefore, Mrs. Lawson,
head of tfee broad faction in St. Chry
sostom's, nad been for(3)aving daylight,
with tennis and archery â of course for
prizes." But Miss Gerard, the leading
spirit among the high church folk, had
outgeneraled Mrs. Lawson and won
over the powers that were to her pet
scheme of lighted greenery, booths,
flower and fortune telling.
"H'm? What will .you dor* Mrs.
Lawson asked severely. "It has been
rry impression all along that the â erâ
costumes should be subservient to the
âwell, the general eftect."
Margery laughed happily. "Tou are.
quite right." she said. "Never fear, but
I shall be busy enough. It will be my
province to lure in unwary travelers,
and lead. them on to financial destruc
tion."
"Margery, how can you?" Mrs.
Chase's eyes rested on^er daughter full
of severe reproof. Mrs. Lawson sniffed
hard, but Miss Gerard came gallantly
to the rescue, saying: "Tou must have
been born for the part, Margery. I
don't know anybodyâ at least any mas
culine body â who could possibly refuse
to follow, If, you wanted to lead himâ
and we all know it's the men and their
money we are after."
"Disgusting!" Mrs. Lawson said aside
to her echo, Miss Clare, under cover of
the general laughter. Margery flung a
kiss at Miss Gerard, saying sweetly:
"Thanky, ma'am! Tou have no need to
dress up. You've been everybody's
fairy godmother so long, you can't pos
slbly be anything else."
"Come home with me! Ned must de
sign your costume. I want him to begin
right away," Miss Gerard said, rising
to go. Everybody else stared. Ned was
her artist nephew, rich withal She
could not possibly be willing to match
him with an Elwood girl, yet here she
was giving Margery Chase, the great
est flirt In town, almost Impossible op
portunity. Ned had come to Flrstanes,
the Gerard homestead, only two days
before. As yet Elwood folk had hardly
more than seen him â in the family pew
Sunday morning and later driving with
his aunt. Some mysterious excursion
had taken him away early Monday
morning. It must be he would be back
before nightfall. Was Miss Gerard thus
bent upon flinging Margery at his head?
That was a puzzle so absorbing noth
ing else was talked of all the way home.
Margery was neither rich nor of distin
guished familyâ even as to her beauty
there were more than two opinions.
Â« Adverse opinions wavered when at
last the lawn party came to pass. A
slender, floating, misty shape, in trail
ing vapory white, bearing a slender
black wand whose tip gave out inter
mittent flashes, nobody could deny her
charm. Now and again the flashes
came from the silver crescent above her
forehead. They were rose red or spec
tral, bluish or greeny- yellow, according
to her humor. Whatever the color, they
drew mightily. There was not a man
on the ground but followed them Joy
ously and lamblike to slaughter in the
booths.
Still it was not surprising. In day
light, and everyday clothes, Margery
had before-time captivated every mar
riageable man in town. The rector,
even, had not escaped. What wonder
that Miss Gerard was almost her only
stanch woman . friend?
Miss Gerard was radiant over the
party's success. "You're my lucky an
gel," she .said, patting Margery's cheek.
(Copyright, 1903, by T. C. McClure.)
Margery knelt beside the prostrate
figure, dabbling its face with water and
crying softly. So Ned saw her when he
came back to consciousness. He tried
to rise, but .she made him 11s stni until
the doctor came. He was not very re
bellious. Scales had fallen from his
eyes. As he lay staring Into the dark
ness, listening to the subdued stir and
bustle round about him. he saw how
near he had come to shipwreck In his
worship of an unscrupulous woman.
If he had been a hero of romance, he
would have made It up with sweet Mar
gery then and there. Belnir o manly
mortal. dpenly abashed by the crowding
sertse of his own folly, he did not sneaic
until three years later, when by hard
work he had proved hlmse'f a man
amons men. Of course she said yesâ
Was he not her fairy prince? And
whether or not they will live happy ever
after, this much is certain, the world
outside will hear no news of disagree
ments
The last words were shrieksd out. At
the sound of them Ned hurried toward
the group, flushing with shame, yet his
mouth setting hard in the obstinate
Gerard line. He took hold of the wo
man, and made to lead her away, say
ing almost roughly, M So this is how you
keep your word! Tou promised ma on
honor to stay at the inn. Get back
there! At once, do you hear? Other
wise â you will not see me again."
"If you come with me," the woman
said defiantly, wrenching herself from
his hold, and folding her arms, her
large eyes fast upon him in a hypnotic
stare. Miss Gerard stepped between
them, her face very white. "Get thisâ
creature â away â anyhowâ Edward,'*,
she said very low, the words coming
hard; "let us have no blatant scandalâ
for the sake ofâ the Gerard came."
"Come." Ned said imperatively, not
even holding out a hand to the woman.
She made one step after him, then
sprang furiously at Margery, who stood
apart with averted eyes, clutched the
lantern at her waist, tore it loose,
swung It high above her head and
brought it crashing down with all her
force, aiming to strike with It Mar
gery's crescent-crowned forehead. Ned
was too quick for her. With s wheeling
swoop he interposed his own person,
and caught the blow fairly between the
eyes. It sent him down like a log.
breathless, senseless, inert. After one
look at him the woman who had struck

she said. "Not serious. I think. The â

ran on as ahe shouldered between the
other two. "I know all about your plot

Just as the lamps began to dim and the
lanterns to sputter out "The affair is
a gorgeous success â thanks to you.
And I have been so nervous over it.
Thank heaven that woman kept away."
"What woman?" Margery asked un
der her breath. Miss Gerard answered
in the same key: "The Rlckman woman

her husband, but not divorced. Ned
came down here because he wu be
witched with her â and knew aha was

"I'll do it for nothing,- Margery
flashed back with a laugh. Her light*
were out. She had used them 00 prodi
gally that the tiny battery cells were
exhausted. Ned had been very happy
over contriving them, and slinging
them in a silver lantern from Margery's
waist. He came toward the two women
now without seeing them â they were
sunk In a deeply embowered nook of
the shrubbery. Miss Gerard gave Mar
gery's hand a caressing pat, aaylng af
fectionately, as she nodded toward her
nephew, "He's a good fellow, Margery.

you'll really like being mistress of Flr

' "Please, mamma, do not bu7 that hat
for me," pleaded a little girl,, as* her
mother tried on a pretty brown felt
hat trimmed with a long scarlet bird.
"I am a member of the bird society,
you know."
The saleswoman spoke up. "These
birds," said she, "are all artificial birds.
The bills are made of bone and so are
the feet; the feathers are bird feath
ers, it is true, but the birds were not
killed to obtain them; and, as for the
body. It is all of silk, stuffed with cot
ton. The eyes" are glass eyes."
The little girl locked the scarlet
breasted bird In. the face and wavered.
"If you are quite sure it is an artificial
bird," said she, "I will wear It." .
Near by there were groups, of little
birds with tiny, heads and long, spirited
tails, and a bunch of these, enough to
make a bird orchestra, were placed
upon the crown . of a large, round, ' flat
hat, while another of the D'rds wai
sewed underneath, upon the bandeau.

At another table sat a luncheon
group; and by some strange coinci
denceâor was it done on purposeâ all
the guests wore felt hats trimmed with
flowers. They were roses and.bunches
of autumn leaves, tiny button Woses and
bunches of white flowers, while one hat
was decorated with those brilliant^ red
satiny poppies of California.
And how they are using birds this
season. Away with the bird societies
and their prejudices. Birds are trim
ming everything and yet there are
thousands of birds left, for the coun
ters are filled with them. Such a^-bird
display was never seen in a previous
winter.
The first one, the wife of a well
known millionaire, wore a round Eng
lish turban made of chinchilla, the en
tire hat being covered with the fur.i
crown, sides and all. . The foundation
might have been wire with fur covering
it, for the hat was- light. Â£
Another hat was very prettily
trimmed with little headsCind tails: a
third was faced and banded wjth very
narrow straplpr.ps of sable; nhd there
was a hat that had a sealskin crown.
But the prettiest fur hat of all was an

elaborate piece of winter millinery.
And a great many of the hjis are
elaborate and difficult for the home mil
liner to handle, though extremely pret
ty and satisfactory when completed.
Particularly was a brown hat in a
November trousseau a thing oi beauty,
for its tall crown was trimmed with a
very wide band of shaded red and pink
ribbon, which was knotted at the back,
leaving streamers' that hun.? to the

What captured the masses was his democratic ways. We usually pic
ture royalty as surrounded by all the pomp and display which go to inspire
awe and dazzle the multitude. King Edward not only dispensed with the
military, but absolutely refused even police or detective escort. He walked
Irishmen as the most popular monarch that ever wore the crown of Great
Britain and Ireland. The proof of this is the enthusiastic reception he
met with in *tll the four provinces of Ireland during his late extended visit.
A few days prior to his departure from the leader of the Irish
Parliamentary party, John Redmond, issued a "pronunclamento" advising
municipal, and civic bodies generally, not to present loyal addresses to the.
King, but to receive him respectfully. Outside of the Dublin City Coun
cil this injunction had but little if any effect. Bishop, priest and layman
vied with one another in doing honor to the monarch whom they believed

mo'e a. m-re fri?ndly feeing let vce v England and Ireland.
Many Liberal statesman, like Lords Rosebery and Aberdeen, supporters
of home rule have been among the inner circle of the King's personal
friends. Of course, he has carefully abstained, as in duty bound; from tak
ing sides on party question.*, but Irish leaders have had reason to know he
was friendly to their cause. King Edward has, many qualities which endear
him to the sport-loving Irishman. lie ls'a good sportsman, a patron of the
turf, likes to play cards and is what is called a free-liver. In some respects
he resembles his rollicking ancestor,. Charles II. 'When Prince of Wales, be
.fore the heyday in his blood got to be "tame andwait upon the judgment,"
he gave considerable trouble, to her gracious Majesty and her God-fearing
Ministers. Queen Victoria, during her long reign, always manifested great
partiality for Scotland and everything Scottish. Her favorite residence
was at Balmoral, her ;favor!te servant , the Scotchman, John Brown.; Her
daughter and granddaughter married Scotch nobles and she was best pleased
tn see her children and grandchildren dressed up In the Highland styles -so
dear to the heart of a Scot. Poor Ireland, on the contrary, was always made
to feel that she was the Cinderella' when compared with her sisters on the
other side of St. Georges' Channel. Although Ireland Is famed for the beauty
of Its scenery, there is no royal residence there fpr King or Prince. Dublin
Castle is the official headquarters for the: King's representative, the Lord
Lieutenant, but an Irish Nationalist hates the very name in about the same
degree that a Frenchman does thsBastile. During King Edward's tour, in
Ireland the Catholic hierarchy and clergy were received by him: with'spe

If it best. Nay, more, it would be very sad if such was the case. It would
be time to call in a specialist for th> purpose of trying to correct thÂ« un
r.att:ral cordition. â¢
A healthy child will be noiry. From the time of its birth, when it cries
cut asrainst discomfort, until it passes the age of childhood it is most nat
ural that it should make a noise. But for this it could not properly de-â¬
velop physically. Therefore let parents think twice before exclaiming
"Stop that noise! Will you ever keep quiet? You will drive me crazy with
Jour racket?"
Thj? time may come when the parents would give all they possess to
hear the little one at its boisterous play. ,
As the child loves to cling to its mother's breast, so it is quite natural for
the child to love to live near to the bosom of mother earth. Doing go is ant
to make it healthy and strong. A number of writers have explained why
this is the case. Have you ever known a child to keep clean? If so have
you followed the child's history? If you have it is probable that your heart
hefi bled for the child and for the parents in later years. The writer well
remembers a boy who was held up by the mother of his children as a model
f.f cleanliness. At that time he expressed his belief that there was Fomethin"
the matter with the child. A year or two later the trouble made itself mani
i>rt. A very delicate operation was performed on the child. When he re
gained consciousness and noted the blood his first question was. "Did anv
of that blood get on my clothes?" Later developments proved that the
trouble with the child was even too deep to be reached by a surgeon's knife
What parent would have his child exchange places with such as the one Just
rocr.ticned?
If the child's digestion Js good the active child will want to eat each day
b*twren meals. There will be freouent calls for a piece of sugar-bread cake
or something else to satisfy the craving caused by the demand for energy-
der that the tired, nervous mother crjes out for some cessation of the con
t'nual running around. But let her strive to stand it. in the certain knowl
edge that it is necessary for the building up cf strong bodies with which to
fight life's battU-s for himself, and. If need b*Â». for the tired parents as well.
The mainspring of action in every healthy child is so strong that It is almost
irr.pcf.sible to comply with th~ request to 'sit still."
A time and place should be provided when boys and girls can let their
animal sririta How unchecked. Except at recess, they have but little free
dom at RChviol. Some teachers would even take away their recess. There Is
all the more need of such periods out of school.
A nuniber of other peculiarities may be mentioned as those belonging to
the i.hiid vho is healthy and natural. While they wiil appear in all children,
they will vaiy with the child. Most children are impatient. They generally
hav* strong Imaginations. They are affectionate. Until taught differently
tiiey ate kind to animals. They find much pleasure in small things. They
f>el keenly, for a time, disappointments. They are not naturally fearful,
though quite early they may be taught to be afraid of many things.
The activity of a child is nothing more than the reappearance of forces
produced by the food he has eaten. If you want a child to sit still you
should feed the child Ies3. It is possible to stop him entirely by starving
him. Thi3 may seem a senseless suggestion, but it is more sensible than
to expect a healthy, well-fed child to remain inactive. If such a child should
be compelled to remain still for a considerable length of time it would great
ly injure the child. Criminals In solitary confinement are not fed as others
who are allowed to be more active. It has been found that If this Is not
elore the forces produced by food so disorganize their vital organs that
insanity and death result. Should we rot give the Innocent child as much
consideration as is given to the convicted felon?
From what has been said it will be seen that we are generally mistaken
in thinking that children are active merely for the purpose of accomplishing
something. The child's activity Is generally necessary for the expenditure
of the forces which have been stored up. The child loves to play ball, not
bo much because he likes the play, but because he enjoys the action required
to play it. For this reason a child will often prefer to take the longest road
home. \Yet how often they are criticised by those of us who are ignorant of
the reasons for such actions. , â¢

obligation.
Politeness and refinement exercis e a far more Dc-ient influence over
character than one is prone to believe, and its cultivation *homd be a mat
ter of rfide v.ith the teacher.
There is a large SDice of temerity in my advocacy of this branch in the
public schools, as I have a very distinct recollection of a series of indignant
protests in the form of letters from an, assortment- of teachers scattered
throughout the land, many of whom answer with' no little asperity. Have
rot the teachers duties enough? Is not the life hard enough? Yes. I admit
that it may be. but they forget. In this clamor, that every ',voman who h.i3
to earn her living has more or less a precious hard time of it, with fewer
roses than thorns and a larger installment of sorrow than of gladness; but
though admitting this, I am of the opinion that a woman's life is very much
more pleasant and that the rough edges are wonderfully smoother when
the environment is made more pleasant by withdrawing som^, of the
thorns. â¢ Â©
New, to the refined woman, one who has been sufficiently well cultured to
be cble to secure the appointment as teacher, it must be self-evident that
ehe would be much happier amid refined surroundings, and should they
not be so, then her influence should establish such a condition.
One-half hour each week would do wonders in effecting a transforma
tion that will more than repay any extra effort. . â¢
One ambitious, sensitive chilu-as.Vm ally, whoss? example wilr'accomplish
good, will make miracles. . Â©
In all of the ultra-fashioned schools girls particularly are taken
through a regular course of etiquette, to fit them for de'social world, and
why not the children less fortunate who have no; ad vantages of home train
ing" â¢; Â¦ â¢ <-Â¦Â¦
A womin of refinement teaching a public school must often fÂ«el re
volted at the manners cf the little people who -Tire so easily corrected whsn
nrrroached in the proper spirit, and it would seem less unnieisant to reform
these tender rprigs than to train the hardened shoots of Inter years.

fully when apked "Will you kindly do 50 and fo," than when we nre com
manded "to do so and so."
No one is ever the loser through exf^ding courtesy, and we all 'know
how much pleasure these trifles add to life. . Â©
The politeness clauses should embrace a perk* of "Jaivp." or. as the Iti?!
fane ?r.y. "conversaziones." in which various topics should l>e discussed. Â®
TÂ«k^. for inrtaneo, table manner?. Let a kn'fp^foVk. p'->t<?. cup and sÂ»*'i

children be reatcd at the table in full view of the others.
The teacher could then proceed to instruct tne child In the presence of
the whole school as to the proper use of tab.e appointments. After a series of
such Iecture3, which should be repeated at ihort intervals lest they forget,
another phase could be descanted upon.
Two chSdrcn should be introduced and taught the conventional way of
extending and receiving an introduction, and then, by talking in pairs ami
meeting other pairs, the se"ries.of introductions could be invested with such
humor as would make It a pleasure to both teacher and pupil"
An amiable teacher with a well developed vein of humor would find such
classes a pleasant relaxation, but she should cultivate the tact tnat sucis
clear of both ridicule and sarcasm. A sensitive chiid, who felt Its lack of
polish, would be deeply hurt by ridicule in the presence of a whole school,
but this self same sensitive young one would be the quickest to profit by such
lessons.
In this splendid country of ours, where fortunes are made in a day and
the sons of laborers have an equal chance, through brains and, ability, of
rising to the very highest positions in the gift of the people, where the daugh
ters, through beauty of person or tha indefinable charm of grace, may wed
millionaires, the necessity of this species of training is obvious.
Many of these children know nothing of the graceful amenities of life.
which they are so anxious to learn. They are ambitious and self-reliant, as
all American children are, and yet are hampered by the total ignorance of
the merest rudiments of social ethics.
In Washington, which is supposed to be the segregation focus of the
moat brilliant men In the country, thÂ« laclt Â°* polish is often deplorable, and
those having the Interests of the rising generation at. heart cannot fail to
appreciate the value of a course of "polite lessons" In the schools.
From the rules of etiquette, the Â»ubject of "Cleanliness" should pro
gress and be Insisted upon.
The hands and nails should be examined each day. and soon the child
would learn to take pride in being considered neat.
I confess I have more confidence in a good, old-fashioned lathering
than in the inexhaustible subject of hygiene. The latter sounds more sci
entific and grandiloquent, but a real strenuous scrubbing with plenty of
old-fashioned soÂ«p and a large percentage of elbow grease and muscle will
fill the bill as far as young ones are concerned.
An abiding faith In this enforcement would seem to accomplish much
absolute good as lessons in the Bible, as we can certainly serve the Lord
with a much cleaner spirit when physically clean.
Mental and physical cleanliness are very closely allied and the child
who is taught to be clean mentally and physically is apt to be clean
morally.
At any rate, lessons in cleanliness will never do any harm, and per
hnps a little less science and a little more common sense might be better
understood by little people.
Home training is undoubtedly the best, but where the mother la Ignor
ant and knows nothing: nave of hard, unflagging labor and multiplied
cares she has little .time to teach the brood, even did ahe know herself, as
many .of them do not. In fact, she can better learn from them.
That children would be immensely Improved by the introduction of
such classes cannot be denied, and that the teacher also would be benefited
goes without saying. v
It might come a litt\e hard in the beginning to tone down a crowd of
young savages, but the teacher who set the example of good breeding
herself and who spoke courteously at all times would be repaid by the
influence of her own personality. There are few children who cannot be
influenced by example in this regard, and it seems a pity that ao many
bright, ambitious and attractive little ones should grow up totally ig
norant of the very principles of courtesy, or the little \ mannerisms so
graceful in a woman. * !
The children of the public schools go through an awful system of cram
ming: that is often both foolish and Useless as far as future U3e may be con
cerned, and it would seem a wise provision to substitute practical lessons on
fiollteness for some of the extraneous matters that will amount to nothing
n the long run.
Let some of the women so devoted to club life, who are always canting
about the betterment of everything under the sun that had better be let
alor.<\ do some practical good by agitating this Idea.
â¢ If they have the time to figure in women's conclaves the tl/ne so devo
ted might be better spent in visiting various schools once or twice a week,
and instead of poking- their noses Into all the cupboards in search of water
bua-s or little specks of dust and overturning lunch baskets to see if the food
were nourishing, thus mortifying and humiliating Httle people, as Is often
done â If these ladles with hearts so full of morality and meddlesomeness
would tnke this time and do the real good that would better fit those arabi
t'ous children for a higher social environment more Kood would b? accom
p'tFhed. And there are precious few children, particularly those in the
higher grades, who have received Just enough education to enable them to

POLITE CLASSES IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

them our 'education' we are not
making them acquainted for th'e first
time with the virtues. These Indiana
are , by nature hospitable, generous,
faithful, and they keep the laws ( a
great deal better than many of us."
"Better than the tradeis, you think?"
"I'll tell you what one of the traders
himself told me. You know," the pro
fessor said parenthetically, with a
twinkle In his eyes, "you know they
think I am a crank down there, that
I 'side 'in' with the Indian too much,
so" I'll give you some statistics from the
mouth of a trader, whence it will
doubtless have more effect than from
mine.- .Well, this trader said once that
he had never lost a dollar. through any
dishonesty of the Indians. Not a dol
lar! And he has been there for years.
In the terrible winter a few seasons
ago he trusted the Indians with U0.000,
and it is all paid back. Some of them
died in that winter still owing for the
provisions he had furnished to them,
but their relatives paid their debts.
The only persons who have cheated
him were white men, those Illustrious
examples that the Indian Is daily ex
horted to emulate." ,
"But If they have come to so dis
trust the white men how were you" able
to know them so intimately? Why did
they â¢ admit you to their Inner circle ?"
I asked.,: \
. He smiled. "Glass, beads and honesty
"Surprising, Isn't It, that after a few
such experiences the squaw fails to de
velop a feeling of cordial confidence to
ward the white man!
"There were two Indian boys I
knew," Professor Monson went on,
"who had gone away to school and
each learned one of the white man's
trades. They were as fine, stalwart
Indian lads as you could hope to see
when thev came back and went to
work on the reservation. They were
giving excellent satisfaction, when one
day a union. man espied them and
promptly demanded their discharge.
The proprietor happened to be one of
those men constructed without cere
bral vertebrae, so the Indians lost their
places. My sympathies were enlisted,
so I hunted up the walking delegate
and found an Irishman who had been
a naturalized citizen only about ten
years. I suggested that the Indians be
admitted to their 'brotherhood 1 if that
was all they had against them.
" 'Well.' said Pat, when I had fin
ished, 'I'd like to oblige ye: faith. I'd
like to oblige ye, but we don't want -no
"foreigners" In this union!"*
"Here, then, is a new definition of
foreigner, to wit: A man who has In
his veins the blood of people who were
Americans v/hen the first President of
the United States was still an English
man. Here were these boys educated
at the expense of the white man that
they might earn their bread and' then
denied by the white man the right to
so earn it, and reduced to a state
where they must be supported by tax
ation of the white man. Is it not
strange that the Indian mind finds it
difficult to assimilate the white man's
ideas on political economy!' .^
"What is" there then for these boys
to do but to revert to the mode of life
of their fathers? And if that is their
ultimate destiny, for what purpose
have they been educated away from
It? And, speaking of education, you
must remember that in introducing to
wrought the charm," he answered. "I
hire Indians as guides and always treat
them fair and square; "I buy all I can
of whatever they have to sell, and I
encourage them to talk. When you
listen to all the stories an old chief
may choose to tell he is flattered and
will quickly spread good reports of
your party. Then the glass beads are
a great help. I have "won my way to
the heart of many a shy little Navajo
miss with a few cents' worth of col
ored glass, and after that the way to
the parents' hearts is an easy road." .
"Some of the Indian women are really
beautiful," he went on, handing us a
picture that showed the regular fea
tures and soft, dark eyes of the "Nava-
Jo Jewess.
"Some of., them follow almost the
Semitic type, while others again clearly
show a trace of the old Castilian blood,
but best of all in my eyes are the
strong outlines of the true Indian face.
Look at this. Is It not a sweet face
and capable, too? You may be assured
that this woman Is queen within her
house, as Indeed Is every Indian .woman
within those mud walls that bound her
domain. Here everything i3 ordered

inwardly groaned.

"Life Is too short to drudse," said

miserably. But he was only a man.
practical and unimaginative; he could
not know that to the girlish, romantic
mind it was simply impossible to think
of love as other than thrills, kisses and
blissful hours of being together.
Lucie cried heart-brokenly. Vot a
week she stayed at home and hugged
her grief â not nearly so Joyous a pro
ceeding as hugging Tom, and talking
and laughing in their ;olly way to
gether. But on Thursday she went to
see Emma Day. Emma was a music
teacher. Then the tide turned. It
was a buxom Irish girl with pleasant
face and hearty voice. She wanted to
take music lessons. She was cook in
a foine family, ma'am; rhe h3d three

an' could she be afther larnln' to play

Miss Day looked commiseratingly at
the girl's big, unshapely fingers.
"It takes a long: time to learn to p!ay

it would cost you about all your wages.
Frankly, I would advise against it."

asked piteously. "I cooks on your

"You think it is a dreary country?"
caid Professor Monson as we began

route we were very devout. 1 assure
you. Well paid for our labor? I should
think so! Pottery and bis'iet nork anij

duced an ancient jar from \ cliff ruin
and accepted cur silence for awed ad
miration and no nw/i-e than the ob
ject's due.
"These two canyon?. De Ch^ley a^d

"One or two of these cliff structures
must have housed 200 people or fo. The
largest cf them may have contained 70
or 80 rooms, while back of the defenses,
in the solid rock, was a great common

while weapons excavated from about

must have defied attack, for even to

all attempts to reach them."-
Professor Monson indulges in some
speculation* on the state of mind of
that ancient American who, after an
evening social in a neighboring cave
castle, where, perhaps, prehistoric
punch had been served with true Indian
hospitality, was forced to seek a front
door like this by the light of the moon.
Viewed from that point, cliff dwelling
might present disadvantages, but, on
the other hand, think of the opportuni
ties for balcony scenes between a Mon
tague and Capulet of prehistoric Ari
zona!
Hut this 13 a sad digression from the
reflections geological, anthropological,
ethnological, archaeological and pale
ontologica! which contemplation of this
repion should produce.
Professor Monson was prepared to
talk on his ethnographical photo
graphsâthe whole 500 of them full
view and profileâ but he had little more
than begun, had just told- how they

discourse, and he began replacing his
treasures and finally laid them away
with a sigh. Behold the injustice of
man to the intellect feminine"
But though he gave up trying to in
culcate ethnological theories, the pro
fessor felt bound to correct any Feni
more Cooper conceptions of the red
man that we might possess, and his
tales of the Indians of to-day took the
place of the accounts of the aborigines.
"For instance, the Moqui," said he
"is as guileless as a three-year-old

observation and illogical in reasoning.
The specimens of the white man he

very poor specimens indeed, and he is

some of the traders who buy the In

Look at this blanket and think of the

squaw had. to care for the sheep that
grew the wool, do the shearing and
carding, dye and spin the wool Into
yarn and then build her loom and plan
her design before she could start on
the weaving, which may have taken
many months. The product of all this

THE old adobe courthouse at Pres
cott, Arizona, was crowded, for
tbe trial was one of unusual in
terest The defendant who was
accused of murder, was a member of
a wealthy California family, who had
placed him in charge of a range and a
band of sheep in Arizona. Ho was a
young man of slight build and nervous
temperament who had shot and killed
his neighborâ also a sheepherder. The
deceased was a large, burly, quarrel
some man, who had often threatened
the defendant with violence, but who
was unarmed at the time of the homi
cide, although this fact was unknown
to the defendant who fired the fatal
shot under the Influence of an irrational
fear. Insanity was a difficult defense to
establish, for at the time of the trial
the defendant gave no sign of weak
mentality, and for a year or more be
fore the shooting he had lived alone in
a cabin in the mountains. Evidence
was given that the paternal grand
father and a maternal aunt cf the de
fendant had each been an inmate of an
asylum for the insane, and that there
had been three suicides in the family.
But the Insanity of th.e defendant him
self at the time of the shooting could
only be inferentlally shown, for
there was no direct medical testimony
obtainable, and non-expert witnesses
could only testify to unusual acts of
the defendant and physicians could
then be permitted to give evidence
whether such ac*.s were indications of
an unsound mind.
The case looked badly for the defend
ant Â¦ when his counsel called to the
stand a white-haired man, who. testi
fied that a few weeks before the ho mi-
"What ! facts," was asked, "caused
you to consider your life in danger
from the defendant?"
"Well," said the , witness, "I had
watched my employer closely, for he
was often about the kitchen, where I
was cooking. His eyes would often di
late and contract rapidly. He com
plained of headache, loss of sleep, pain
in the head and eyeballs, flashes of
light before the eyes and. general ex-.
haustlon. He was melancholic He
would suddenly become frightened and
Jump from his seat when the kettle
boiled over. He evinced dislike and
suspicion of all about him. He was rest
less, irritable and unable to apply his
mind to the every day affairs of life.
On the day I left I had roasted a leg of
mutton for the noon dinner, and when
he started to carve It he muttered to
himself and instead of slicing the meat
he thrust or stabbed It with the knife.
"Because my employer was crazjr and
I considered my life In danger," was
the reply.
"Your honor, I object," paid the lilt>
trict Attorney, "and I mov* to strlki
out the last 'answer of the witness. He
is shown to be a cook and not a doctor,
and cannot give an opinion Â¦** to the
sanity or Insanity of the defendant"
"Motion sustained," Bald :he court
"Mr. Witness, you will testify merely
as to facts and not 'as to your opin
ions."
The old man bowed quietly in reply to
the court and awaited the next ques
tion.
"Why did you lea^re?" inquired
counsel for defendant

ant as a cook, and that ho had worked
in that capacity until the day be&>*a

on foot for Prescott Â¦'/Â¦'Â¦'- r V
"Have you formed or expressed an
unqualified opinion as to the guilt or In
nocence of the accused?" said the coun
sel. "I have," replied the Juror.
"Challenged for cause," said the law
yer. "Is that opinion a fixed and c>
cided one?" queried the District Attor
ney, "or would evidence change It?"
"It is fixed and decided," was the re
sponse, "ami no evidence would re
move it" "Was that opinion formed
from anything you read in the news
papers?" questioned the prosecuting
officer. "I never read anything about
It In the papers," answered the Juror.
"Was it formed from hearing a state
ment of what purported to be the facts
in the case, from any witness?" said
the District Attorney. "No. sir.." re
plied the Juror. "I never heard any
thing about the facts In the case from
anybody, and haven't the least Idea
what the facts are." "What do you
mean, then?" queried the law officer,
"by saying that you have a fixed and
decided opinion as to the merits of thÂ«
case?" "Well, sir." answered the Ju
ror, "my brother has made up his
mind." "And have you also made up
your mind?" "No, sir," was the an
swer. "I only came Into the Territory
last week, and I don't know the first
thing about the case, but my brother
has made up his mind. You see. my
brother was summoned on this Jury,
not I, and he was busy at the ranch
and couldn't come to town, and he sent
me here to answer for him and say

"unless you are an escaped lunatip
yourself, will you tell me what you
were doing out here In Arizona as

With some emotion the old man told
his modest story. He had beea-itranted
a year's furlough to enable him to
make a Journey around the world. Ar
rived in San Francisco, he had been
persuaded to Invest all his available
resources in a promising mining swin
dle and went to Arizona to examine
his property. He found It absolutely
worthless. He was ashamed to write
home and tell what he had done, and
he determined to work at anything
that he could get to do until he could
earn enough money to return, and so
donning his . oldest; clothes 'Â¦Â¦ he sought
and obtained a . position as' cook on a
sheep "ranch."
The jury, on the Instructions of the
court, acquitted the defendant without
leaving their seats, and the old doc
tor, after refusing all compensation ex
cept his mileage and pay as a witness,
bought a railroad, ticket with his'sav
ings and departed East to resume his
duties as physician in charge of an
Eastern asylum.
I concluded then that he was afflicted
with idopathlc mania that was likely to
take a homicidal form, and after din

LONDON, Nov. 28.â Serious differ
ences have recently arisen between the
Duchess of Marlborough and some of
the workmen employed pn her splendid
London mansion which is now nearing
completion. Some time ago she or
dered marble from Irish quarries to re
place Italian stuff of which she d'd
not approve. The Connemara product
was duly delivered in its rough state
and Italian workmen were set to work
to polish it. Her Grace came one day
to see how the polished marble looked
and she was so disappointed with its
appearance that shs wired to Conne
mara asking the American syndicate,
which is working the quarries, to take
It away. When an expert from the
quarries arrived he discovered that the
marble had been "queered" in the pol
ishing and he asked the Duchess to
allow, him to put one of his own men
at work at a piece of the 'marble. Her
Grace was astonished at the result.
It was pointed out to her that the
Italian workmen who were all compe
tent craftsmen neglected to do their
work . properly because the product of
their own country had been rejected.
She grave orders to clear the Italians
off the premises immediately. The
contractors argued that they were
under a contract to have work finished
by a. certain date, and. if the polishers
were discharged the French and Ital
ian carvers would be likely to strike.
"I don't care," said the Duchess, "if
the house is not finished for five years
these men must not be employed here."
And the men had to go.
Â¦CABNEGIE STILL AMERICAN".
. Before Andrew Carnegie accepted the
Invitations of the cities of Limerick
and Waterford. I am told that he
-made careful inquiries as to whether
the conferring of their freedom upon
him would in any way interfere with
his status as an' American citizen. He
h^d long Interviews in the House of
Commons with John Redmond, who
represents the city of Waterford in
Parliauwmt. but It was not until he
consulted his lawyers that he agreed
to accept the prciTered honor.
"I, want no honors or titles or any
thing of the kind," he remarked to
John Dillon, who is a close personal
friend of his. "All I want is that what
I am doing In the way of free libraries
shah be. productive of some good to thÂ«Â»
present and succeeding generations of
Englishmen and Irishmen. I know that
the 'freedom* of the cHIes of Waterford
and Limerick entitles me to rank as a
citizen of both, but you must never
bother me with voting papers or any
thing of that kind, because I never in
tend to take anjpart In serious politics
outside the United States." i Both Mr.
Dillon and Mr.- Redmond gave him a
written' assurance to that effect.
YANKEE MONEY IN DOLLS.
In various parts of Ireland there are
at the present moment many under
takings which never would have been
entered upon j!>ut for American money.
The latest Is a doll factory situated at
a place called Stewartstown. in the
county of Tyrone, close to the banks of
Lough Neaghâ the largest lake in
Great Britain and! Ireland. The estab
lishment of this" factory Is duo directly
to the enterprise of a Mrs. Frances Rld
deh, who, when a simple peasant girl,
emigrated to America thirty years ago.
She made money by investment In real
estate In the neighborhood of Chicago
and has now returned to do something
toward alleviating the distress ot her
native country. With the assistance of
another American â the Hon. F. T. Wall
of Cincinnatiâ she has founded what Is
known as the Co-operative Home In
dustry Society and the manufacture of
dolls Is the first Item in the programme.
Already a good start has been made,
and as many as sixty girls are finding
constant employment. The capital re
quired was not much â something like
55000^because all the materials re
quired can be found In the immediate
locality. Irish products alone both in
the models and the dressing are 'to be
used. It. Is not Intended to produce the
stage Irish man or woman, but to give
an accurate representation of the na
tive In a faithful manner. Mrs. Rld
dell Is at present confining her efforts
to cultivating trade in the British Isles,
but she has hopes that in time she will
be able to do a big trade 'with the
United States. The furnishing of dolls'
houses will occupy . her attention
later on.
LONDON. Nov. 2S.â When a rich and
famous English society woman, the
Countess of Warwick, took it into her
head come four years ago to found an
agricultural collepe for English gentle
women she was subjected to a good
bit of ridicule as a dreamer. But the
college has begun to turn out girl farm
ers now, and lo! it appears that they
understand the business from A to Z
and â what is more than most English
men can do â make money at it.
Two of the earliest graduates, Miss
Blenkiron and Miss Hawkins, good
looking daughters of professional men,
have begun to attract attention as
farmers for Marshall Dugdale, one of
the richest men in Wales. When asked
as to the results of his experiment Mr.
Dugdale exclaimed:
"Who ever would have thought I
could have stood two ladles as my head
dairy farmers for two years? I
wouldn't have said so two years ago.
but I didn t give Lady Warwick and
her Women's Agricultural College their
due. When I got hold of the prize
graduates and set them to managing
my Weish cows and sheep and pigs
and rabbits I found they knew their
business."
Mr. Dugdale, whose 1000-acre farm is
in the mountain district of Llanfyllin.
Wales, was the first oÂ£ the big "gentle
men farmers'* in the British isles to try
the exponents of the Countess of War
wick's Beading enterprise. The success
of his experiment shows signs of hav
ing set the fashion. Most of the young
women graduates from the school
which teaches hoeing, pig-feeding,
calf-raising and other homely arts, are
petting positions, although none as yet
has done as well financially as the two
whose work Is now attracting atten
tion.
WOSK IS PROFITABLE.
Miss Blenkiron and Miss HtHridna

In addition to all the dairy products
they want, a garden of thtir own Â»nS a

top of a hill that co:r?3 near to beine
a mountain. CThe ascent to the place
Is precipltat* and in printer the house
Is often snowbound. Yet these hardy
girls, not within several years of thirty,
run their jtairy in all weathers, milk

necessary, make butter <tnd cheese in

which Mr. Dugdale is keen on, on
emergency help -with the herds of
Welsh ponies and with, the haying* and
occasionally lecture on model farming

LlanfyUln. :^.\
Miss Blenkiron, plus the labor of di

methods and so forth., makes no less
than sixty pounds of butysr a day. Miss
Hawkins makes and eoxnetlxies drives
around the country to deliver a dozen
hefty cheese of the Cheshire brand.
The two girls together in the course of
a year handle about 40.000 gallons of
milk fresh from their sixty cows.
The two girls, like all student^ ad
mitted to the Lady Warwick Hostel for
the study of the lighter branches of
agriculture, are delicately reared j and
well educated ladles. Yet the things
they do on Mr. Dugdaie's farm are aa
nothing in proportion to the things
they learned to do at Lady Warwick***
HosteL They had dally practice in the
culture of the garden proper, with its
associated branches, such as fruit farm
ing, the growing of mushrooms and to
matoes, flowers and vegetables; in
poultry rearing, beekeeping, dairy
work. Including the actual feeding of
cows and pigs; cider and Jam making.
Both young women learned to mow, To
build houses for the culture of flower?
and the principles of landscape garden^
ing. Miss Blenkiron took particularly
keen interest in zoology and was as
pociated with Miss Hawkins in many
dissecting operations. Both studied
chemistry, botany and bacteriology
along with their zoology. And, ""wise
women that hostel graduates must be,
they learned bookkeeping.
LANDLORD IS ECCENTRIC.
Oddly enough, the man who has been
lucky enough to have all this agricul
tural wisdom placed at his disposal
makes no pretensions of being a model
farmer. He is an eccentric gentleman
who is interested in everything from
curio collecting to pig raising. He Is

TOE NEW^HO\VE,OF THE TIVOLI AND THOSE WHO MADE IT FAMOUS.
Place Theater In New York, when
the good Herr has a mind to opera.
There is the first production of "She,"
the romantic opera by "Billy" Furst,
director of. the Tivoll, that -ran for
fifty-one nights there and. afterward
for five years on the road.- There are
productions of local genius, Ocsax
Weil's "Suzette" and the "Pretty
Poacher," H. J. Stewart's "Bluff KI1M5
Hal" and "His Majesty." There is the
whole range of the Offenbach r^pet
toire, Strauss, Suppe, Bpieldjeuj Le
cocq, Balfe, and sq on, anÂ£ Gilbert and
Sullivan are thoroughly "represented.
Only indeed by doing .things like 'last
week's "Zaza," last year's "La Tosca"
and "Andre Chenier,'.' the "Queen of
Sheba," "Otello," "Hansel and Gretel"
of late seasons, could the Tivpli hope
to live up to its honorable lineage: '
The stranded company has ' been a
prolific source of supply to" the Tivoll.
It gave us Collamarini, Russo, Bar r
bareschl, Castellano, of late years; and
gave the first. Italian opera at the
house in 1SS2. But the first venture
was a polyglot arran^emeut^-not the
last â the company using up several
tongues during, the performance. 'TnÂ»
opera, by the way, was Verdi's VBallo
in Maschera," and ran. for twenty-one
nights. ' v â¢â¢
It was in '95, thirteen years later,
f that Mr. Leahy inaugurated a "regular
season of grand opera. Before .that
time the grand and comic opera were'
sandwiched indiscriminately together,
the idea of separate seasons not having
occurred, to the management. A modest
eight weeks was the first grand opera
record, and since then it has varied
from that unto a twenty-week, season.
Most of us are familiar with its later
history. "â¢' ' 'i 1 0
Once only has this unique twenty
five-year season of opera been inter*
rupted, wh?n to please Edwins Stevens
"Cyrano de Bergerac" was put on in
f 9Â». It was one of the cleverest things
Edwin Stevens has done. A rather
curious coincidence is r that: the hbuse
was first closed for the death of Presi
dent Garfleld, September 20. K81," and
last closed on September J.9^ and 20,
1902, for McKinley*s ' funeral. 7 The
theater has been closed only for a few
weeks since its opening, foiCtlj?i deaths
c-^curring in the Kreling family, for al
terations aÂ«d repairs.
Until last year the Tivoli was vcKblly
under the Kreling oJanagementT Jo-
Beph, l'aunder of the house, was â¢ its (
mainstay until his death irt 1887. Wil
liam- then took the cares -Of manage
ment upon his shoulders, and oh his
death in 1893 tflby were undertaken by
Mrs. Ernestine Kreling. Mrs. Kreling,
before that time chiefly concerned with
the buttons and appetites of two small
boys, then entered upon the work of
theatrical management, and might
have been seen any time for the last
ten years in the old Tivoli office, doing
anything to dressing dolls for the
Christmas show. How succeseful Mrs.
Kreling ha3 been, always with the in
spiration of Mr. Leahy behind her, Is a
matter of common knowledge, and as
the head of the Tivoll corporation that
Is to handle* the new theater, one* can
wish her only the same good judgment,
enterprise and high purpose that have
so far been hers ln her theatrical
career.
And now, the following lists of the
operas produced will no doubt prove In
teresting, for they Include everything
that the Tivoli has given:

Where does it all gro to, the music?
Where do the thrill, caress, tht sweet
pang of It cease to be? The big chords
ciÂ£hing through one's ". eins, the mel
ody stealing into the heart, Is it there
Â©aljr that they are buried?
I looked wonderjnRly at the stripped
walls of the old Tivoli this week for
answer. Surely, eddying in some cor
ner, one might hear, murmurinf faint
ly as sea music purls through a shell,
an echo of Salassa's song, of the honey
th)i,ated Collamarini. of Gregorctti, the
r*fw ido!? Purely of the music that has
rung through the Tivoli for twenty-five
years there should so:nev her be some
tiny echo? And listening then 1 I fan
cied I could hear It and see the eeiitle
phosts of those who have made the
little opera-house famous. Sal-assa was
there, his scholar's face mocking above
the artist garb of Iago, his tender bary
tone proclaiming- with e.oquent cyni
cism the "Credo." Michaiena was there
making most musical love â and trying
to look as if he liked itâ to Effle Stew
art in "Romeo and Juliet " Mascagni,
in a nobly wilted collar, waved again
his electric baton over* the "Civalleria"
and smiled his big boyish smile at the
'.'Hymn to the Sun." There was Scheel's
eager, artist face, bendir>5 over the first
Brahms symphonies given to San Fran
cisco. Thvre â¢ were Mams -lies Colla
marini and De Lussan, each passion
ately pouring out the '"Halanera" for
all she was wofth. Gregoretti's "Largo
al -Factotum" still crackled through the
house, his infectious laugh stIU rippling
t-.rough its empty Fpacf Barron Ber
thald, now a j^reat person in Germany,
stalked in in fine and solemn fashion
in "The Jewess." And ihe'-e were Mons.
(yuille, Maurice de Vrles, Gustave Hin
iichs, Adolf Bauer ar>4 wr<6 knows how
r^aiiy more?
There was a laughing crowd In one
corner, Alice Nielsen's soprano giggle
nnd piqi;ant little face prominent
among them. Ferr'.s Hartman's Â¦wide
Fmlle and rakish barytone were not far
off, nor Master Webb's cherubic grin
and unexpected venor Ed Stevens'
l^ng face, long Bides and long note re
called forgotten hysterics, and Caro
Roma's Katisha seemed to have plenty
to do with the case. Annie Myers'
piquant, impertinent little face Â« laimed
and recelved^a hearty welcome, and
older beauties, Tlllie Salinger, Belle
Thorne, Gracie Plaist^d. beamed over
the soubrette's plump shoulder. And
still older faces, whom I did nU know,
paihered and surged until I was fain
to leave the darkening hall. Then I
ivent to the desefied box office, with
its horse shoes and j;ilent telephone and
found Mrs. Kreling with j. tear in one
eye and a Emile^n the other.
It was. however, Mr. Leahy, who is
"Doc," that I wished to see, -?n<? to him
I am Indebted for t3ie following gossip
about the famous little house.
The Tivoli's lncÂ«?J>tion was j*a remark
able as Its subsequent history. In the
early *70's a young man. Joe Kreling- by
years old, came here, Joe KrÂ»ling by
name, and music-struck by nature. His
father was here before him, and th^v
came from Germany. He very shortly
conceived the idea, that San Francisco
would stand for a^permanent musical
entertainment, and to thsa r.nd engaged
the old Bowie place, J Sutter anc*
Stockton streets. Thisâ known among
the children as "haunted" â Kreling re
modeled and opened In 1874 -under the
title of "The Vienna Gardens." This
venture was immediately
The crowds soon overflOrwed J the plac-?.
Then came the question of new quar
ters, and in 1878 work on the new
place â now the "old Tivoll" â began&It
wai opened in 1879 by the Krellng
brothers, "William Krellng having
joined his brother in the meantime.
The first attraction at the new thea
ter "was the Vienna Ladles' orchestra,
and afterward there were concerts
given by the "Spanish Students," a dis
tinguished band of mandollnlsts, guit
arists and such, that were stranded
here on their way from Mexico. The
house was then something on the order
of the old Fischer's, the lower floor a
cafe, but almost immediately Joe Krel
lng began to realize his ultimate dream,
opera. Little more than a year after
ward the Tivoll gave the first produc
tion of "Pinafore" with one of
the half-dozen "Pinafore" companies
stranded out here, the opera running
for 104 consecutive nights!
Of course after that the policy of the
house was assured, and since that time,
nearer six than five hundred operas
have been given, embracing all classes.
At the beginning this meant tremen
dous effort for the promoters, "Joe" ln
particular. His daily programme of
work makes the eight-hour day look
like a picnic He would be found in
the box-office all day, taking charge of
the bar in thÂ« evening, after the per
formances translating German, French
and Italian operas into English for
the company until 2 or 3 o'clock in the
morning.
But Mr. Krellng got his desire, though
he undoubtedly paid for It with his
life. The TIvoll became famous, and is
still unique among operatic institutions.
And what things they used to do in
those old days! One finds In the list of
their productions colossal things like
Mozart's "Magic Flute," the "Don Gio
vanni," "William , Tell," "L'Afrlcaine,"
"Der Frelschutz." Again there are
all the operas that Herr Conried

of her art. . A- sensitive ear, plenty of

To wear a dress suit and appear like
a gentleman seems to be the require
ment for men in society as well as "su
pers" for the stage. He Is certain to
be in demand for every social occasion
if he is considerate of others, looks
pleased, knows when to send a few
flower^ and is generally polite. A few
"parlor tricks" renders a man partic
ularly desirable for house parties.
Some one has defined a gentleman as
one who does everything you wish him
to do and does nothing you do not
wish him to do. The kind hearted
hostesses of this city so cheerfully as
sume the entire responsibility of enter
taining that little is expected of the
bachelors in the capacity of hosts. So
little do the bachelors discharge anyso
fial obligations that they quite aston
ish when at rare intervals they give a
rmall theater party or give us a free
ride in the Government tug. Last sea
son, however, the bachelors' ball was
a welcome Innovation and should have
been hailed with delight, if only to en
courage the men in reciprocity. Yet,
there was so much opposition that
some of the patronesses were afraid to
appear lest they be identified with a
social failure. After withdrawing once
or twice some women actually tele
phoned all about town to see what
prominent families would be represent
ed at the ball and finally accepted at
the eleventh hour to scintillate at a so
cial success.
If the bachelors pull themselves to
gether and give a ball this year let us
do the correct thing for once and avail
ourselves of their hospitality.

If Polonius were to visit San Fran
cisco he would advise the ladies to be
somewhat chary of their maiden pres
ence, for nowhere else do young women
entertain the men so freely. In the land
where I was bred young men gave most
of the dancing parties not restricted to
the home. In this city nearly every
year a number of very young girls put
their good money together and give a
r.a.11 of some kind, while their men
friends merely lend their presence and
Fhare neither trouble nor expense. The
Oayety Cotillon Club, recently formed,
consists of twenty-five young women,
chiefly debutantes. They have pro
vided the money and toiled assiduously

he subjected to no more serious criti
cism than undue generosity. I have
just received a letter from a high-bred
woman, recently of this city, asking if
the young ladies do not generally do
more than their part in entertaining.
She says:
An army officer stationed at Fort
Baker noted for his cleverness recently
Eta-ted that before making his appear
ance at a tea he always wrote a three
hours' pass for his brains. He is not
the only one.
Let a woman be so gentle and so cor
dial in her hospitality that it may be
6aid again by a certain gallant old gen
tleman:
Guests congenial are brought to
gether and all possible ingenuity is ex
ercised to provide something unique for
entertainment. Artists, palmists or
mind readers may be brought in to add
zest to the conversation. Only at teas
do people's minds seem to go on a vaca
tion, although the hostess must tax
her own wits to the utmost.
Genuine hospitality, prompted by the
desire to confer pleasure upon others,
is the most important requisite in en
tertaining and the hostess who poss
esses it is a Joy forever. California wo
men hold the palm for generosity in
throwing open their homes and dis
pensing happiness. Their hearts seem
10 grow larger, like the tree3 and fruit
in the Golden West. In' entertaining
lavishly money is a very good thing to
have, but it is by no means as neces
sary as tact. Let a hostess arrange
e-verytking for the comfort and pleas
ure of her guests and convince them
that their pleasure does not give the
slightest inconvenience but rather that
they have given a personal gratification
to her by coming.

SALAMANCA, N. Y.. Nov. 28.â State
Senator Albert" T. Fancher and State
Senate Clerk James Spencer Whipple
are home from Washington, where they
have been making an effort to engineer
an Indian deal that will make Vree
lar.d's Indian allotment bill look like a
canceled postage stamp if it be carried
to a successful conclusion. The pres
ent scheme had its inception about
eight years ago, when Senator Fancher
drifted into the Indian Territory. He
succeeded in securing a lease of nearly
1,000,000 acres of Indian" land for oil
purposes. Without awaiting the ap
proval of the lease by the Interior De
partment, Fancher put down several
wells and was rewarded by finding oil
in paying quantities. . In the meantime
several other politicians were- let in.
The lease was secured for only ten
years and has but two more years to
run, and it was found desirable to ob
tain an extension.

opinion rendered by Circuit Court
Judges Acheson, 'Dallas and Gray was
filed by the former. Judge Kirkpat

der for the receivership made perma
nent, or until the further order of the
court. The opinion, in part, follows:
"Upon the whole, we are of the opin
ion that the , bill presented a case of
which the Circuit Court, sitting in
equity, had Jurisdiction and that the
appointment of "a receiver was within
the authority of the court. We also
think there was evidence to sustain the
findings of the lower court and to jus
tify the order appointing a receiver.
Whether a receiver should- be appoint
ed was a matter largely within the dis
cretion of the court, in view of the spe

David Bennett Hill has made over

the two principals knows whether a deal
between them is possible. Senator Hill
is still a leader of great strength in the

told Murphy that it is hardly probable
that the State can be carried for any
Democrat without the approval of Hill.
Judge Parker still refuses to make a
move to further the posslbifity of his
own nomination. It is generally under
stood he will have the support of Hill
as Boon as the latter decides that his
ov.Ti chances for obtaining the nomin

expressed the opinion that the Dela

taken himself from the ranks of Pres

made to obtain the support of the New

Agents of Senator Arthur Pue Gor

of weight. They also have visited Mur

be made.

principal reasons for the closing of the

Shooters Island, in a statement issued
to-day by Wallace Downey, president of ''
the Townsend-Downey Ship-building
Company, at the offices of the company
here. The statement follc-ws: Â¦
"The temporary embarrassment of
the Townsend-Downey. Ship-bulldlng
Company is directly, the result of losses
and delay in performing contracts, in
curred through the abominable condi
tions prevailing in the labor and ma
terial market during the last two years.
The exorbitant demands for workmen
and restriction of value of work done,
added to the impossibility of securing
promptly from steel manufacturers
material for ship construction, have
rendered it Impossible to operate to ad
vantage. Th jse difficulties, and the fact
that the credit of the ship-building in
dustry has been completely destroyed
I by recent revelations regarding the pro
motion of the United States Ship-build
ing Company, has for a time prevented
the carryinc out of the plans of this

property and a modern equipped plant
for ship-building, dry-docking and ship

WASHINGTON, Nov. 28.â For some
time the Preeldent has been discussing
informally with members of Congress the
proposition to reduce the duties on Phil
ippine products coming into this country
to 50 per cent of the Dingley law rates.
Considerable oppcsltion|has arisen to tho
suggestion, and what the result of the
endeavor to secure a reduction of the
duties will be cannot now be foretold.
The opposition arises principally from
Congressmen representing sugar and to
bacco States. They maintain that if only
BO per cent of the Dingley rates are levied
on tobacco and sugar the industries rep
resented by those products in this counV
try will be impaired seriously. They have
indicated to the President that" they will
make a hard fight against the proposed
reduction.

STRONG TERMS USED

The appointment of the royal commis

ing the creation of a board for, the ad
ministrative business of the War. Office
and the consequent changes involved is
generally regarded as foreshadowing the
position largely ornamental, .and Lord
Roberts is understood to consider that
his present ill health offers an opportune
excuse for his retirement, thus leaving
the field clear for any changes which
may be reached for the King's approval
by the" commission. From the terms of
the reference to the commission it is
quite evident that it was apointed to find
a practical means of carrying into effect
the recommendations of Lord Esher, a
member of the commission, who urged
the abolition of the post of commander
in chief and the appointment of a gen
eral officer to command the army, mak
ing him responsible to the Secretary- of
War for the efficiency of the .military
forces. Lord Esher further rectnmend
ed the establishment of an advisory and
executive board, .presided over by the
Secretary of War, on the lines of tv.2 Ad
miralty board.
LONDON, Nov. 28. â Although no pub
lic announcement of the fact has yet
been made. itMs understood that Lord
Roberts is about to resign as comman
der in chief. He has been much more
ill than generally known, is still abed
and the condition of his health requires
him to spend the winter In a southern

Ni(tf|j|Â«I But how soon, in many
cases, the wife loses the
advantage and fades in face and fails in
flesh, while her husband grows even
more rugged and robust.
There is one chief cause for this wifely
failure and that is. the failure ..of the
womanly health. When there is irregu-
larity or an unhealthy drain, inflamma-
tion, ulceration or female weakness, the
general health is soon impaired.

DB. PIERCE'S BEMEDIES.
Just a little pain may so distract a
man's mind that it will cost him hun-
dreds of dollars. Life is a battle. To
.succeed one needs all his energies! and
all his brain force to apply to the ques-
tion at hand. Even "a corn will make
him irritable, cross, angry â and an an-
gry man seldom succeeds. The trifling '
pain of a corn is a pleasant feeling be-
side the agonizing ache of piles. That
is a Dain whi/h seems to pervade the
. whole body: It communicates itself to
'air the parts hear the seat of the trou-
ble and brings on a heavy, dragging
feeling in the perineum. Those who
have never so suffered do not know
what it means. It racks the nerves^
prevents sleep, prevents' concentrated
thought and makes a man 1 lose flesh as
fast as he would with a virulent fever.
And yet piles are looked upon as a
little thing. They are neglectedâ al-
lowed to. run on from month' to month
and year to year. By and by comes a
dangerous surgical operation. Maybe
it curesâ maybe it kills.
There is only one sure, safe and quick
cure for piles. It is the Pyramid Pile
Cure. It is a recent discovery and its
properties are such that it cleanses,
soothes and heals the inflamed parts,
reduces the inflammation at once, and
with continued treatment removes all
swelling and all trace of the disease. It
puts the membranes in a healthy,, ac-
tive condition and cures completely and
permanently.
From. Samuel Victor, Detroit. Mich.:
"I had , not written you sooner because
the first box of Pyramid Pile Cure I
used helped me so much, and I wanted
to > wait until I was completely, cured,
and so it was that after using three
boxes of your Pyramid .Pile Cure I am
entirely cured of : the terrible disease
from which I have suffered six months;
and now I am usinsr Pyramid Pills,
which help me very much."
From' B. H. Palmer,- Windsor, Cal. :
"I. have been troubled for fifteen years
with ' piles and have tried different
salves and "ointments, but never came
across anything like your" Pyramid Pile
Cure. I used: two 50-cent boxes 7 three
months ago, and they have* made a
complete cure, and I am recommending
them to every one I know to be afflict-
ed. Thanks for the cure."
From .Thomas A." Nixon, S54 N.< Bam-
brey street, Philadelphia: "It is now.
time I should let, you know; that. I am
cured of bleeding piles- If you only,
knew how I have suffered from- them
for the last nine years . in pain. â¢ Last

1300 cases of typhoid fever and fifteen

in which they, say the borough of Butr

gave his opinion confirming the' title of
the Alaska Copper Company to the
complete and undisputed ownership of
the Bonanza mines back of Valdez, the
key to the Copper Rfver Company situ
ation.
The .decision undoubtedly means the
building of the road, as the Havemey
ers are th,e financial backers of the vic
torious- company.
Â¦ The Bonanza mines are valued at $17,
000,000, though this Is Just, approxi
mately, as estimates of their value can
be made only from the surface indica
tions. . Senator Heyburn of Idaho, Con

Burleigh, formerly receiver of the

The cuestion as" to the title of the

State, and to-day a mass of rusted iron
on the plains of Southern Idaho testi
fies to h!s unsuccessful effort. In later
life Virtue was not fortunate finan

PHILADELPHIA. Nov. 28.â Army and
navy officers were the honored guests to
night at the "Founders' day" banquet of
the Union League Club. The list of guests
included Lieutenant General Young, Ma

bln, Brigadier General A. T. Bates, Brig
adier General John A. Johnson. Admiral
Dewey. Rear Admirals Brown. Remey,
Melville, O'Nell, Clark, Harris, Sigsbee,
General John C. Black, commander in
chief of the Grand Army of the Repub
lic; Senators Penrose of Pennsylvania
and Perkins of California, and Governor
Pennypacker of Pennsylvania.
In response to a toast General Young
made an Interesting epeech concerning
tho army, in which he said that the re
cent organization of a stan* had done
more to promote ,Â£he efficiency of the
army of the country than any other act
of legislation which Congress had pro
vided.
Rear Admiral Sigsbee spoke oh the ne
ces>-tty for an efficient navy. He said in
part:
â¢"The most difficult problem that the
navy has to solve at the present time Is
in respect to her personnel. We find it
well nigh impracticable to enlist, train
and keep enough men. for the needs of
the service. Time and experiment will
eolve the problem.- but it must be ad
mitted that the solution is yet hardly in
eight. Formerly the British navy suf
fered from desertions and rrom other
troubles that we now have, but Great
Britain overcame the difficulty. With U3
at present the . shore career offers the
greatest promise. When we have found
ways and means to reverse these con
ditions, the problem of enlisted personnel
y- 4 ll have been solved. We are coming to
it, alth^URh slowly."
iNEWTORIi, Nov. 28.â Among the pas
sengers who arrived to-day on the steamer
Philadelphia were Commander Robert E.
Peary, Lieutenant Commander, Wiiliam
S. Sims and Lieutenant Surgeon Henry
G. Beyer, U. S. N.. who have been in
specting the barracks 1 system â¢ of/ British
and German naval stations with a view
to determining the advisability of build
ing similar , barracks at- our navy yards
for the housing of seamen to take' the
place of receiving ships. Commander
Peary said there was no truth in the re
port that he had negotiated for tho pur
chase of a ship for his next expedition to
the Polar seas.
Commander Peary said he probably
would leave here in July and try to reach
the north Â»hore of Grantland and camp
there/until the coming of spring, when
the dash to tho pole will be attempted.
"I will make the hardest try to reach
the polo that has. yet been made. If I
can get my ehlps'to the north shore of
Grantland," he said, "I will answer for
the rest. I am confident that I shall reach
the pole. I am familiar with conditions,
and I ; have the experience, I know
the road thoroughly, and . I , know
what I will have. to contend with. An
other reason is that I have reached that
stage in my acquaintance with the Es
quimos that I can utilize them as I see
fit and distribute them as I desire. If I
get to Grantland I am sure I can attend
to the rest. I will also find a way to get
back to the ship.",
Commander Peary said that his wife
would not accompany him this time.
clines to meet representatives of the
United Mine Workers of America, on
the ground that the present condition
of affairs was brought about "for the
sole purpose of aiding- their organizers
in Installing their union in Its suprem
acy to the law, order," dignity and
peace of the State, and the absolute
exclusion from work of all employes of
the Utah Fuel Company who would
not Join their union."
Kramer says that his company has
at. all times been willing to submit to
the State Board of Â¦ Arbitration any
grievances that may exist between the
employer and employe covering such
questions as may properly come before
the board. . , ;

If you lack vim, vigor, vitality.
If something is eating away your con-

The book tells of my discovery. Tells
how after thirty years I found the causo
cf the symptoms, and many others,
given r.bove.
Ttxe !*>â¢>:< tells how by scientific ex-
porim<:it I traced out the causes that
brfu* "ii chruniÂ«dlseases. It tells how
I perfected my prescription â Dr. Shoop*s
Restorative.
1 four.d invariably where there was a i
Brcaksess that the inside nerves were

Where there was a lack of vitality that '
Um vit.il nerves lacked power.
Where weak organs were found I al-
ways found weak nerves.
Not the nerves commonly thought of
bat the vital organ nerves, the Insideâ i
the Invisible nerves.
This was a revelation. 'Â¦
Then my real success began.
Then 1 combined Ingredients that I
would strengthen, that would vitalize !
these nerves. :
That prescription I called a restora-
tive.
It is known the world over now as Dr.
Shoop's Restorative. After that I did '
rot fall to cure one case in each hun- j
cred. In the extremely difficult caues <
nay failures for five years were one in 'Â¦
each forty treated. I found cancer in- !
curable. Cancer is for eurgery, 1 not j
medicine.
Then how to get this prescription to ,
the sick â¢ones everywhere was my'
thought. i
1 must announce It in the public press. â¢
But, thought I. will they realize the )
truth of my discovery â The real power)
of Dr. Shoop's Restorative? Then a
way camo to me â like a revelation.
"I will offer it to the sick on trial." ;
paid I. 'Then they will know I am !

entirely at my risk. >
Send no money. Just write me for j
the book you need. When I eend it I
will tell you of a druggist near you who ;
will pc-rrr.it the month's trial.
Use the Restorative a month. Then |
decide. If you say to the druggist. "It j
tbd not help me. ' that will relieve you '
of any expense whatever. He will bill '
. the cost to me.
This is my way of clearing your minA *
<">f all doubts as to what Dr. Shoop's :
Rf-storative can do.
No matter how prejudiced, you cannot
dispute this absolute security I offer. 1
You cannot resist an offer like this ;

which settles an Interesting point of
railway law. A passenger sued the
company for damages owing to the
overcrowding of his compartment; the
company pleaded necessity, on account
of the fountains playing at Versailles
and also the Longchamp - races. The

and sentenced the company to pay

"The placing in position of some 300

weighing more than a ton, necessitates
minute and heavy labor and resemblea
the methods of medieval workmen."
says the architect, of the Louvre, who
Is charged to overlook the construction.

roughly cut stone and finish it in posi

SHOOTS AT BURGLARS;

Detective Driscoll, who was shot in
the stomach by Neidermeier, was still
alive to-day.
"I was only a boy then, but I did not
intend to be run over by an officer and
when he tried to make me get off the
train I decided it would be my life or
his. After shooting him I got off the
train and went from there to Winni
peg and heard no more about the case."
Previous to his career as a hold-up
and murderer in Chicago. Peter Nei
dermeier was already a murderer, ac
cording to a story he told in the Har
rison-street police station to-day. His
first victim was a train man in Can
ada. To the police officers and railroad
detectives who were .questioning him j
he related the circumstances as fol
lows :
Â¦ "In 1S95 I was beating my way West*
on a freight train loaded with coal,
bound for Portage, Ontario. When rid
ing on top of the train I .was ordered
to get off by a man whom they called
'Captain,' but whose name I never
learned. I heard afterward he was a
railroad detective. 'He ordered me from
the train and when I refused to get off
he threw coal at me. I threw back at
him and one of the lumps struck him
on the head. Then he drew a revolver
and fired twice at ma. Both times he
missed me and then I drew my revol
ver. I fired six shots and three of them
hit him. I shot him in the head, in the
abdomen and in the side. He ran a few
feet and fell dead on top of the car.
I searched him and found no money.
Later the train crew came along and
I heard they found $10 in his pockets.
I was 'sore' when I learned what I had
missed; ~
When I try to think of the details my
mind wanders. It is like a dream."
CONFESSES ANOTHER MURDER.
>When t thought he was ready, to do
thV job I â¢ covered him. ; I told him ; if
he made amove I would shoot him on
the spot.
: "I -don't "know just how- I escaped
from that. bloodthirsty mob yesterday:
That another murder was planned by
Van Delnj Roeski and Neidermeier ap
pears evident from the confession of
Roeeki, none other than himself being
selected as, the possible victim.
In his confession- Roeski says he was
the drudge, of the other men, and that
during the last few weeks had believed
that Neidermeier and Van Dein were
ready to "get rid of him," as he ex
pressed it. \f
"I- never got much," he said. "They
used to buy me something to eat and
give me a few nickels once in a while.
They afterward got 'sore' on me be
cause they thought I might give them
away. Marx told me that Neidermeier
and ;. Van Dein were going to 'do
me up.' " .
Marx Is the man whose confession
led to the capture of his companions
yesterday. ' ' . :
."Van Dein and Neidermeier knew
that I was ; the only one who could im
plicate them in the carbarn case," con
tinued Roeski, "and they hungered for
my. life. -They would have killed me
yesterday, even when all of us faced
death, .if there had been an opportun
ity,, but. I knew it and watched them.
I had ' to protect myself against their
murderous designs, as well as the men
who " tracked . us. '
"Not long ago Van Dein tracked me
into^ the j. woods somewhere in Indiana.
He pretended he 'was searching " for
dynamite that* ; was buried. But . I
knew, he wanted to kill me.
PLANNED TO KILL ROESKI.
It was said to-day that- Miss Dunne
is willing to marry Van Dein before he
stands trial.
Mrs. Van Dein again put her arms
through the bars toward her son. In
spector Lavin, who had been warned
that an attempt might be made to pass
firearms to the. prisoner, caught the
grief -stricken mother by the shoulders
and" gently drew her back.
"We will come again, Harvey," said
Mrs. Van Dein as t she left the cellroom.
A moment later when | questioned by
the police the prisoner resumed his us
ual indifferent' demeanor. .
"We've got mothers, like other peo
ple, haven't we/ Pete?" was what Van
Dein 'said to Neidermeier* last night.
This morning Van Dein's mother read
the remarkfih a newspaper and wasted
no time in going to her boy. v
Mrs. Van Dein said:
"You have sinned, Harvey, and you
must suffer. But remember you are
not beyond redemption and your moth
er is with you." i<
For a few seconds the prisoner sat
as if dazed. Then. he caught sight of
a^smaller and more girlish figure stand
ing beside his mother and he arose and
walked toward the door of his cell.
Mrs. Van â¢Dein, speaking between her
sobs, said: "Qh, my son, my son."
She put her arms through the bars and
put her hands upon the prisoner's
shoulders. Then Mamie Dunne, \ Van
Dein's sweetheart, stepped forward and
shook hands with the prisoner. At this
point Van Dein displayed his first sign
of emotion.
Van Deln's mother called on him at
the police station to-day. The meeting
was affecting. â¢ â¢ '

Sc/vea In Indiana Friday nor of the

of State's Attorney Dineen to bring the
men to trial as quickly as possible. It
may take two trials as all four of the
men worked together, but It happened
when the greater crimes were commit
ted one of the number was absent.
Roeski was not at the robbery of the
car barns, and had no part in, the mur
ders .committed at that time. Marx
was alone when he killed Officer Quinn
and was in Jail yesterday . when thÂ«
murders were committed in Indiana.
Either one of these two. therefore, will
probably have a separate trial unless a
general plea of guilty is made by all
four men'.' '
MAY HAVE TWO TRIALS.
Indictments were voted charging Van
Dien with complicity, in five murders;
against Neidermeier for four murders,
and asrainst Marx for four murders.

NKW YORK. Now 28.â The i Financier
says: The most striking feature of the
official statement of the New York asso
ciated bank* last week and that which
chiefly attracted attention was the im
portant increase of $2,213,850 in surplus re
serve. This resulted from .the sain of
$7Â£S,500 in cash and the reduction of $.">,781,
400 in deposits, through which the reserve
requirements were diminished by $1,415,
350. which sum added to the gain in cash
made the above noted increase of $2,213,
859 in surplus reserve of $6,125.200., Cal
culated upon the basis of deposits, less
those of $26,809,700 of public funds, the
surplus is $15,S27,C23. There was a de
crease of $S,3fU,6 <! 0 in loa-ns, which, it may
be'r.oteii, leaves this item only $9,197,000
above the mir.imum of the year. .Specie,
legal terdcrs and deposits are at the
lowest of the year. The reduction in
loans last week was not unexpected, for
there was more contraction as the result
of stock market liquidation, and also be
cause of a decision of some of' the banks
to augment their percentage of reserve
to deposits. The gain in cash was
smaller by }1 ,591,000 than that estimated
on tho basis of the traceable movements
of money during the week. This is prob
ably accounted for by the fact that the
imports of $3,830,300 gold shown in the
estimates were not made fully available
because of necessary delay in payments
therefor by the assay office; hence tho
statement was made on rising averages
for cash. In this connection It i*j ; note
worthy that, as has been showri'during
the fortnight.^the direct drain of money
from the banks to the West and to the
South; Is at an end, and hereafter we
may look for a return movement in some
volume, especially from ; the former sec
tion. Moreover,' about $3,500,000 gold is al
ready in transit from London, to arrive
this week, and $2,500,000 more will be
â¢hipped hither on ' its arrival at the Brit
ish capital from South Africa.^;^, .-'^ .

A very notable Duke, who has estates
In the three kingdoms, and who holds
almost princely sway over many work
ers, had occasion the other day to dis
miss a laborer for some slackness or
misdemeanor. The man was angry at
being "sacked," and, having nothing
further to fear or hope, wanted to say
something very hard and hurting to his
master. He could think nothing much
of the kind, for the Duke had been
good to him and to his. He was turn
ing away, when he suddenly remem
bered *that~ the Duke's "lady" held a
position at court with the Queen. That
was his chance, and his cue, so he
turned round on the Duke: "Oh, yes,
your Grace," he said, J.T11 go home.
But though I'm a poor man, thank God
I never had to send my missis out to
service as you had." The Duke smiled.

John C. Reeves of Portland, familiarly
known as "Del," and having a national
reputation as a rattlesnake hunter, has
recently gained fresh laurels.
Last week thirty-six rattlers, ranging
from fifteen Inches to four and a half
feet â¢ in . length, were killed by him In
the Somerset Mountains, situated east
of Portland. ; Seventeen of various
lengths were killed within a, space of
about fifteen square feet.
Some of the large snakes had nine or
ten rattles, while some of the smaller
had but one or two. The snakes were
beautifully striped. Ten baby rattlers
were found huddled together near their
nest, which was In a rock crevice.
Mr. Reeves captures his" snakes by
stealing up on them, while they are
basking In the sun and pinning them
to the ground with a forked stick four
or five feet in length. He then uses a
club. . .
Mr. /Reeves finds much sport In rat
tlesnake hunting, and also finds it very
profitable. - One dollar an' ounce is
realized from the oil. The skin nets
him from 25 cents to %2, and occasional
ly more for an unusually large one.â

than effecting economies by a shut

so that when the busy season arrives

"He was a man of about 45 years of
age and of temperate habits and de
yoted to his family. He had been liv
ing a retired life since he forsook San
Francisco for New York, and I am* pos
itive that it could not have been any
cares or worries in the business line
that prompted the suicide."
"I was of the opinion that, my uncle
was living perfectly happy, and so far
as I know he had no reason to end his
life," said he. .. "He was well known here
in wholesale business circles'" and was
considered a shrewd man of affairs and
honest and upright in every transac
tion. He came out- here on a visit about
two years ago, remaining for some
weeks. At that time he was In. the best
of spirits, though he complained of.fall
ing health for some time previous. I
often heard from him by letter since
that time, and many 'times he wrote, of
his falling health, so' I am of the opin
ion that it was Illness which- caused
him to end his existence.

death Marcus Banner was greatly

NEW YORK, Nov. 23.â Victor Ban
ner, 55 years of age, a bachelor, com
mitted suicide in his apartments, 107
West Sixty-ninth street, to-day by
shooting himself in the right temple.
His lifeless body, partially clothed,
was found on a chair In the bathroom
by a colored servant. Near by on the
floor was a revolver. On the table was
a note reading:
"Please notify Simon Banner, 10
West Seventy-fourth street. You know
why I have done this."
No one in the house heard the shot
and the terrified maid who had ob
served the body, the bathroom door
being slightly ajar, at once informed
Dr. Hatch, a dentist in the house, who
notified the police. Mrs. Reslnger, the
landlady, was not at home. It is inti
mated that Banner lost considerable
money in Wall street. Simon Banner,
the man mentioned in the note, is a
brother and the owner of the Del
Monte, a fashionable apartment house
here. With his son, S. Morrel Banner,
a lawyer, he. lives at the address men
tioned. Another brother, Peter, with
his family has apartments at the Hotel

Simon and Peter some years ago con
ducted a dry goods store at Broadway
and Grand street. S. Morrel Banner,
the nephew of the dead man, said to
day: . '
"I am absolutely at a loss to account
for the suicide of my uncle. We knew
little of his movements lately and rare
ly saw him. He led the life of a re
cluse since he came here several years
ago from San Francisco. As to his
personal affairs I know nothing. He
had some money, I believe, and he was
operating In Wall street. He never

Special Dispatch to The CalL
The present commission consists of
MM. Durand, Alphandery and Marigan
of the Court of Cassation and MM. Mer

the Ministry of Justice. M. Alphan

Nothing has yet transpired to indi
cate that General Andre has discovered
documents of doubtful authenticity or
that there was maneuvering on the part
of the Minister of "War during the
Dreyfus trial to conceal important
facts, though assertions to this effect
have been made. It is stated that M-
Gribelin, formerly principal keeper of
the records of the headquarters staff,
has made Important revelations. The
commission will receive the documents
next "Wednesday.
The decision of Minister of Justice
Valle to refer the question of a revision
of the Dreyfus sentence to a
commission, it is officially stated,
is based upon an article of the criminal
code which provides that in a case
where, after condemnation, new facts
develop, or where previously unknown
proof of a nature which would tend to
establish innocence is presented, the
condemned person has a right to ask
for a revision of sentence and the right
to pass upon such request belongs to
the Minister of Justice, who will decide
after having taken the opinion of a
commission, composed of three " direc
tors of his ministry and three members
of the Court of Cassation.
Dreyfus owes the favorable action ta
ken to the careful consideration given
the case by Minister Andre, whose con
clusions are regarded as in the highest
degree favorable to Dreyfus, since they
determined the Minister of Justice to
refer the Question of a revision to a
commission.
PARIS, Nov. 28. â The efforts of Al
fred Dreyfus to secure a Judlcal exam
ination of his case iiave at last been
crowned with success. After examin
ing the dossier in the case submitted to
him by General Andre, the Minister of
War, Minister of Justice Valle has
transmitted that document, together
with the petition o/ Dreyfus, for a re
vision of his sentence, to M. Durand,
the president of the commission insti
tuted by the Ministry of Justice. This
commission will pronounce upon tho
admlssibility of the- request for a re
vision of sentence.

ADVERTISEMENTS.
ADVEBTISE3CENTS.
People who make a dally practice of
taking one or two of Stuart's Dyspep-
sia Tablets after each meal are sure to
have perfect digestion, which means
perfect health. â¢
There is no danger of forming an in-
jurious habit, as the "tablets' contain
absolutely nothing but natural diges-
tives: cocaine.- morphine and similar
drugs have no place in a stomach' med-
icine, and Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
are certainly the best known and most
popular of all stomach remedies. '
ABk.your druggist for a fifty-cent
package of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
and after ; a week's , use note the ; im-
provement Â¦ in health, appetite * and
nervous energy.
Only men engaged in a severe out-
door manual labor can live on a heavy
meat diet and continue in health.
As a general rule, meat once a day
is sufficient for all classes of men,
women and children, and grains, fruit
and vegetables should constitute the
bulk of food eaten.
But many of the most nutritious
foods are difficult of digestion and it is
of no use to advise brain workers to
eat largely of grains and vegetables
where the digestion is too weak to as-
similate them properly.
It is always best to get the best re-
sults from our food that some simple
and harmless digestive should be tak-
en after meals to assist the relaxed di-
gestive organs, and several years' ex-
perience has proven Stuart's Dyspep-
sia Tablets to be a very safe, pleasant
and effective digestive and a remedy
which may be taken dally with the
best results.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets can hard-
ly be called a patent medicine, as they
do not act on the bowels nor any par-
ticular organ, but only on the food
eaten. They supply what weak stom-
achs lack, pepsin diastase, and by
stimulating the gastric glands in-
crease the natural secretion of hydro-
chloric acid.
Is of Little Benefit Unless It Is Di-
gested.
Nearly every one will admit that as a
nation we eat too much meat and too
little of vegetables and the grains.
For business men, office men and
clerks and, in fact, every one engaged
in sedentary or indoor occupations,
grains, milk and vegetables are much
more healthful.

Former Captain of En
gineers Walks Forth
a Free Man.
LEAVENWOP.TH. Kans., Nov. 2S.â
Oberlin M. Carter, ex-carjtaln* of en
gineers, walked out c/, the portals of
the Federal prison Fort Leaven
worth a^frce man early this* morning,
At the gates he was met by his uncle,
L. D. Carter, and immediately * was
driven in a hack to the Union Depot
in this city.
While awaiting his tn>in the ex
army officer conversed freely on a large
r umber of subjects, but always skill
fully avoided the introduction of any
thing in regard to his conviction or his.
plans for the future. He spoke " at
length cbout the prison, but even then
turned the talk from htjaself to gen
eralities. In regard to himself he
merely said: Â© * .
"I am feeling as well as could be ex
pected under the circumstances; de
prived to an extent, as I was, of exer
cise, I could not hope to be better sit
uated."
The captain look*d much older than
when he entered the prison nearly four
years ago, but showed no trace of Ill
health. 0
It was believed laBt night that an of
ficer of the Department of Justice
might be at the prison gates to re
arrest Carter on an old Indictment, but
such was not the case. When he de
cided to leave the gates were thrown
open to him and he passed/out of the
prison walls for the first U/de since he
v/as brought Into court during his at
tempt to obtain a release on a writ
of habeas corpus. He was attired Just
as he was on his arrival at the time of
his Incarceration.
During his short stay here Captain
Carter talked Interestingly.
"Believing in your Innocence as you
do, do you ever think of yourself as
'a sort of a man without a country?' "
he was asked.
"Not at all." replied Carter. "Why
should I? Just because certain men
have done me a. terrible Injustice that
PORTLAND, Or., Nov. 28.â Inez E.
Harrison, who has sued her husband,
M. C. Harrison, for a divorce in- San
Francisco because, as she alleges, he
kissed typewriter girls, has entered suit
in the Circuit Court here to prevent her
husband from taking valuable property
from her, as she says, by fraud. Harri
son i3 well known in local insurance
circles, where he does business under
the firm name of Harrison & Co.
. As told by counsel for Mrs. Harrison
on October 6, Harrison & Co. began
suit against M. C. Harrison and Inez
Harrison to foreclose a mortgage on
some real estate in this city. A copy of
the summons was mailed to Mrs. Har
rison at San Francisco, with no street
address on it, and was later returned to
Portland. Mrs. Harrison alleges that
her husband knew perfectly well what
her street address was, but that his at
torneys deliberately addressed the let
ter merely to San Francisco, hoping
that it would remain undelivered, as

. A mortgage for 51500 had, been placed
upon the property in question. Harri
son paid it, but instead of having the
mortgage canceled he had it assigned
to Harrison & Co., of which concern
he is the principal owner. According to
Mrs. Harrison's contention her hus
band, as Harrison & Co., is suing him
self and his wife to foreclose the mort
gage so as to cheat her out of her
dower interest, as after the foreclosure
the property would belong to Harrison

CARTER'S PRISON
TERM IS ENDED
SUES TO SAVE
HER PROPERTY
CHICAGO, Nov. 28.â Using every
means to avoid notice, Oberlin M. Car
ter, once captain of engineers in the
United States army, arrived in Chi
cago to-night and was at once driven
to the home of his brother, I. S. Carter,
308 North State street. When the San
ta Fe train bearing Mr. Carter drew
Into the Dearborn-street station bis
brother and his attorney were there ,io
meet him. Carter had nothing to say,
but Indicated that at some later time
he might make a statement.
is no reason for me to feel bitter toward
my country. No, I have worked too
hard for' my country to feel bitter to
ward her. She has had the best years
of my life. I never wronged her, as
poor Nolan did in the story, and I love
her. As to my future," said Carter, "I
really have no plans. I must wait
first to vindicate myself before the
American people."
"Will you consider your vindication
Incomplete unless you are restored to
rank In tbe army?"
"Of course," Carter said in reply;
"my vindication would not be complete
without that But that's too far ahead.
I can't talk about thatâ can't consider
it at present."
"It is reported that you have had an
offer from the Holland Government to
help' in the engineering work on the
drainage of the Zuyder Zee."
"I have no offers under considera
tion," he said.
"Many new sidings would have to be
built, and trains on the main line would
be blockaded by the operating of trains
used in the laying of the second track.
Careful consideration of the entire situa
tion will satisfy any one that the best
step was taken and the best results will
follow."
In the East some of the larger roads
were compelled to* take oft their fast pas
senger trains ,in order to facilitate the
movement of freight, and I am satisfied
that if comparative figures could be got
together at present, convincing ' evi
dence of the truth that' the Southern Pa
cific Company did remarkably well by its
patrons, in the face of! the difficulties
that confronted the management of the
road, would be easily obtained from them.
"It Is these very conditions that re
sulted in the undertaking of the- work
of straightening out the Central and the
Union Pacific roads, and Insuring the
patrons of the companies faster and bet
ter transportation of their shipments. Of
course, come people may argue that Pres
ident Harriman might have set this work
In motion at some period when times are
duller and tralTlc less, but I will say for
him that be Is of the opinion that the
Western country through which the
roads he operate-* extend, Is not going
to experience dull times, andÂ«the quicker
the work was finished the more he
thought that the achievement would bo
appreciated. Other people *will argue
that Mr. Harriman should have a double
track. Perhaps he has a similar opinion,
but if he had undertaken to construct
these, greater difficulties would have con
fronted both the railroad and the ship
pers. â¢ â¢
"I sometmies think that the people of
California hare not yet fully appreciated
the great Importance of fhe work that
is practically completed, nor can I Im
agine that the shippers of the State have
arrived at the full realization of the fact
that they gain the most by the successful
results of the construction work per
formed under the eye of President Har
riman. Of late there has been some com
plaint in ' Ca}!fornla regarding the con
gested condition of freight along the
Southern Pacific lines. It is, however, a
condition that is experienced every year
on the lines of the Eastern companies!
To the people of the coast It is something
new, and it will take some time, probably,
to educate them up to the Idea that these
conditions cannot always be overcome or
anticipated. All the motive power and
the rolling stock owned in this country
could not have moved the freight more
promptly than it was moved this year.
SITUATION IN THE EAST.
In discussing the good that -will re
mit to California from the straighten
ing of the Central Pacific and Union Pa
cific roads Mr. Stubbs said last evening
that the volume of benefit that would
eventually accrue to the State by reason
of these Improvements could not be esti
mated at this early period, Â«but he re
marked that it would certainly be enor
mous. Continuing, he said:
BENEFITS TO RESULT.

his friends came as far West as Sacra

southward to Los Angeles. From there

Company will Journty up the coast road

"I cannot believe that p. great news
paper such as yours is, whose character
for fairness is recognized by the peo
ple of Northern California as standing
first among the large newspapers of
this State, would knowingly inflict this
cruel blow upon us. My wife and I are
growing old, and the death of our son
was and for the remainder of our lives
will be a bitter grief to us. How
bitter none but those who have sus
tained a similar loss can realize. The
wound made by his 1 death can never
heal, but there would be a consolation
to us in knowing that his memory had
been cleared from the terrible charge
wrongfully laid upon it.
"In justice to the memory of our
dead son, and to us who brought him
into this world, taught him to follow
the path of the honest and the upright
and to whom naught is left but that
memory, we ask that you publish this
statement. P. L. McDANIEL."
In publishing the article referred to
In the communication from P. L. Mc-
Daniel, The Call had no intention of
doing the memory of his deceased son
any injustice, nor of adding to the
grief of the parents. The article in
question came to The Call in the usual
channels from a correspondent and was
published as any other item of news.
It appears from Mr. McDaniel's
statement, which The Call frankly does
not doubt, that the correspondent was
misled or misinformed.
The Call therefore takes pleasure in
giving Mr. McDaniel's statement pub
licity and regrets that unintentionally
it may have added to the grief caused
by the death of his son.
"I have obeyed the laws all of my
life and my neighbors and others who
know me will tell you that I am and al
ways have been a law-abiding citizen.
"He never called the members of the
family about him on his deathbed, nor
made any statement to thorn, as claim
ed in the article referred to. His death
was a sudden, and to us, a tragic one;
shortly before it occurred he appeared
better than he had been for some time,
and to me he expressed the hope that he
would soon be up and about again. He
was lying quietly on his bed when sud
denly and without saying a word, by
an almost superhuman effort, for he
was very weak, he arose to a sitting
posture, and a stream of blood burst
from his IIds. We rushed to his assist
ance and did everything we could to
aid and relieve him, but he never spoke
again, and died in a few minutes.
"He was not a member of the mob
known as the 'Lookout lynchers'; was
not present at the time of the lynch
ing and knew nothing at all about it
until the bodies had been found.
"He therefore could not have been and
was not kicked by any of the victims of
the mob, as was alleged in the article
referred to.
"Neither did he begin to decline in
health shortly after this lynching af
fair, as alleged in said article, but for
more than a year thereafter enjoyed"
robust health and worked as he always
had worked. It was not until the sum
mer of 1902 that his health began to
fall.
"His illness presented all of the usual
characteristics of consumption" and
was pronounced such by every physi
cian I called to attend him. To the
last, that is to say, up to within fif
teen minutes of his death, he pos
sessed the delusive hope common to
consumptives that he would recover.
The following letter has been re
ceived by the editor of The Call with
reference to a publication -which ap
peared in this paper:
"Editor of The Call-in your issue of
Friday, April 10, 1903, appeared an
article headed, 'Confession Reveals
His Grim Secret,' which purported to
be, and I presume was, a special dis
patch to The Call from Redding, under
the date of April 9.
"The young man whose name ap
pears in that article was my son. He
died on the 8th day of March, 1903, at
my home in Modoc County, Cal., which
had been his home from his birth.
"His death was caused by an affec
tion of the lungs, which every physi
cian called to attend him pronounced
to be consumption. He was about 26
years of age at the time of his death
and had always been a dutiful son and
a law-abiding citizen.

ADVERTISEMENTS.Most fishes seek their food by sight,
says Professor Edmund Clark Sanford of
Clark University, in the International
Quarterly, and these do not usually no
tice It by. any other sense. But those
that are accustomed to find it by smell
seldom pay any attention to It when they
merely see it.
The editor of one of the leading mag
azines of America is well within the
truth when he asserts that methods
which are winked at in business, say
in the buIIIIng up and holding of a
great corporate monopoly, or some ap
proach to monopoly, would cause a stu
dent in college to be kicked off a foot-r.
ball field in disgrace. No amateur sport
would tolerate some ways of commer
cial and industrial rivalry in its latest
forms and manifestations. .
In that respect there is a lamentable
lowering of the prevailing standards of
life when young men leave college and
plunge into the whirlpool of business.
They find all about them tactics which
would be regarded as dishonorable, at
least in the sense of being unfair to
rivals, if attempted in college sports.
Honor loses force and fineness with the
change from school to practical affairs,
after graduation, j
That fact accentuates one of the best
features, perhaps the most valuable, of
the school and college sports which
trouble many adults who think that
they occupy too much time and atten
tion among students; It is doubtful
whether any training Is worth more
than that which teaches boys not to
cheat or play unfairly. The forces
operating ln the other direction are so
many and so potent, in the business
world, that it is impossible to have too
strong a bias," of the right kind, during
the impressionable years of school life.

Benjamin Marsh, "the beggar stud
ent," who has taken the contract to
0prive all the beggars in the city over
to Camden, was sitting In Washington
Square yesterday with two gentlemen
of leisure, whom the Charity Organiza
tion Society set down a*. tramps.
"How's biz?" said Marsh to one of
the tramps.
"Nothin* doinV
"What's i'er graft?"
"Soup houses, back doors, any ole
thing."
"Hear anything about this order to
the bulls?"
"Nope."
"Goin' to drive us all out 'er town?"
"Ye don't say!"
"Orders from City Hall."
"Too many of us, I reckon."
Tramp No. 2 had said nothing up to
this time. Now he chimed in with:
"Yer right there, there is too many
of us, and the police â or bulls, as you
call 'emâ know it. Another thing they
know is that one hobo who "knows his
biz can beat any ten policemen who
get after him. So they let us alone."
"Yes," said the other tramp, "that's
so, and if they should happen to get
us they've got to give us three square
meals a day and a place to sleepâ and
that's all we're after anyhow, or even
expect to get. So we're bound to win
either way," and the. two "walked off,

Herbert Baker of 1046 Folsom street
was taken to the Harbor Hospital last
night suffering from a fracture of the
base of the skull. The injured man
slipped and fell while entering a rear
room in the Defender saloon, 38 East

When the Fire Commissioners met
yesterday afternoon President Barrett
offered the following resolutions out of
respect to the memory of the late Sam
uel Ralney, which were adopted:
Â¦V\*hcrea#. Almighty God. in his infinite wis
dom, havirn rcÂ»n fit to remove from our
midst Mr. Ssmuel Ralnry. a worthy citizen
of this community and former member of the
Board of Fire Commltsioners of the City and
County of Sen Francisco; and
Whereas. For many years he had devoted
hlÂ« best efforts toward the betterment and de
velopment of the San Francisco F*irc Depart
ment, the present bieh efficiency of which is,
in a large degrree. due to this fostering care
Mud hie ceaseless vigilance in all matters af
fecting the best Interests of the department and
its members: his many Improvements and suk
greatlons In the matter of department tool* and
apparatus and best methods of handling and
using the Â«ame, have resulted In great benefit
to the Fire Department; he vu always ready
as a citizen to give his time and mechanical
knowledge In furthering the Interests of the
department which, hy his death, has lost, in
deed a worthy and valued friend; therefore,
be it
FU>*olved. That the Board of Fire Commis
sioners do hereby express their deep regret
at the. death of Mr. Samuel Rainey, and do of
fer to his bereaved family their mon sincere
sympathy and condolence In this time of cor
row at the loss of a kind husband and pro
tector; be it further
Resolved, That the Board of Fire Commis
sioners do this day adjourn out of respect to
the memory of the late Samuel Rainey; and
be it further
Reeolved That theÂ«# resolution* bÂ« spread
upon the minutes of the Board of Fire Com

BOARD SHOWS RESPECT FOR
THE LATE SAMVEL RAINEY
The Labor Council has expressed Itself
as opposed to the nlckel-in-the-slot at
tachments on telephone boxes and a com
mittee has been appointed to argue the
matter before the Board of Suprvisors.
A committee .composed of five promi
nent members of. the Labor Council has
been selected to collect facts and statis
tics regarding the advance in prices for
the common necessities of life. The La
bor Council has been studying the situa
tion for some time, and when the com
mittee makes its report a published
statement will be issued explaining the
situation.
The Carmen's Union is not altogether
satisfied with the decision of the recant
board of arbitration and the men will
soon hold a meeting and will probably
ask for another board to fix their wage
schedule.
The threatened strike of the plasterers
has been averted, as their employers de
cided yesterday to raise the wages of the
men from Jo 50 to $6 per day. The plas
terers demanded {6 50 per day, but de
cided to meet their employers half way.
It was agreed, however, that first-class
workmen should receive $5 50 per day and
it is probable that the men wlll.be di
vided into two classes.
Employers Agree to Give Men $6 Per
Day and Threatened Strike Is
Averted.

While the reason for calling in of Dr.
Spiess has not been made public Ger
many believes that he has been asked
to advise, if not to take in charge, a
second operation, which from the indi
cations will be of a much more exten
sive scope than the first one.
The announcement was made to-day
that the Kaiser had, on account of his
health, withdrawn his offer of a cop
for a trans-Atlantic yacht race in 1904,
nominally postponing the event for one
year, is regarded as an indication that
his physicians have warned him of the
seriousness of his affection, and that
he docs not expect soon, if ever, to be
come a weH man again.
The medical faculty naturally de
clines to discuss the case publicly, and
while it is rolnted out that Dr. Otto
Schmidt, who recently operated upon
the Kaiser's larnyx, has returned to
Frankfort additional confirmation of
the worst fears is found in the calling
of a fourth surgeon in the Kaiser's
case. This is Dr. Gustav Spiess . of
Frankfort on the Main, who Is a friend
and collaborator of Dr. Schmidt and
almost as well known as he as a daring
operative surgeon.
BERLIN, Nov. 28.â Notwithstanding
official bulletins that the Kaiser is re
covering his strength and despite the
fact that he has been allowed to take
exercise in open air, it is learned from
a high authority that his condition is
critical. His throat troubles are not
over. The healing of what was at first
pronounced to be a benign growth has
been far from satisfactory. It is said
that a fresh formation has begun to
manifest itself and that the trouble is
extending from its original seat in the
larynx.

% And so it was a disappointed little
woman that was obliged to return to
her own automobile and watch her re
fuser speed around at the rate of a mile
a minute from inside tho railing.
Barney had just completed a ten
mile handicap between, himself and
Charles Graham of New York on the
local track and was resting for a five
mile dash against all previous records,
when Mrs. Fisher made her way
through the crowd, asking Manager A.
C Denraan of the San Bcrnardlino
Traction Company to introduce her to
the champion.
Having gained an audience with the
dust-begrimed .record-breaker as he
sat in his famous machine, the little
woman made her plea. But it was ln
vain. With all her pleading Oldfield
could not see his way clear to take her
round the course. Even when she of
fered to give the hard-hearted racer a
$5 bill her request met with refusal.
"It is against the rules," explained
Oldfield. "Besides, I would be taking
your life in my hands, which I can
not do."
SAN BERNARDINO. Nov. 23.â Mrs.
Henry Fisher, wife of Millionaire
Fisher of Redlands and a member of
the Four Hundred of that city, created
a sensation at Association Park this
afternoon by attemtplng to bribe
Bsrnoy Oldfield. the "dare-devil chauf

Weekly Call, $1 per YearBy a miracle of good â¢ fortune t San Francisco has escaped
in the last few days several baydisasters horrifying in their
possibilities. Almost as great as this good fortune is the

The American Federation, of Labor and the Knights

The One Talent.
THE San Jose Herald perceives the trade significance
. of the fortunate geographical position of the Santa
Clara Valley. It is near the greatest market on the
Pacific Coast for its varied products. San Francisco and its
populous suburbs and the towns and cities of the valley and
of the adjacent territory on the peninsula insure a continually
augmenting . home demand. The promise far outstrips the
present magnitude of the business to be transacted. Of the
one million acres of land in the Santa Clara Valley, says the
Herald, there are many thousands of acres that are particu
larly suitable for stock, dairy and cattle ranches. With the
vast growth in population that has come because of the fruit
industry the products of these ranches are always in demand
at profitable prices. With the extension of the fruit acreage,
the. -increase of the population and the consequent lessening
of the stock ranch area the products of the latter will steadily
become more profitable. The time of cheap mutton, beef
and pork has gone by. Milk, butter and cheese are staple
products and these are certain to command good returns.
Concerning the fitness of the county for the industry the
Herald says: "The winters in this valley are open and mild
and there. is generally an abundance of green feed every
where by the first or middle of December and in certain sec
tions of the county the natural moisture is such that green
pasturage exists all the year around. ? *" * Here is a
diversity of valley, foothills and mountains, with an abun
dance of pure creek, spring and artesian water and ample
shade for the summer months. Numerous streams flow into
the valley from the mountain ranges east and west and every
little mountain vajley and nearly every canyon has its own
small stream or perennial spring." ;
The Herald finishes its alluring picture by. referring to the
profitable dairies north of San Jose, by hints of fine herds of
Jerseys, Holsteins ' and Durhams, and by the assertion that
"for the raising of beef cattle with a few hundred acres in the
mountains one may begin in a modest way and in a few years
find himself along the highway to independence and possibly
wealth." i '
THE VALLEY'S GROWING MARKET.
If it were possible to transfer explosive figures of speech
into something more tangible than wind energy Senator
Morgan and his mouth might blow the isthmus of Panama
into the sea and solve the problem involved ih the digging of
the canal. The Senator's oratorical effort in the upper house
forever eclipses the historic value of the day of the big wind.
"During one of Senator Stanford's
trips East or abroad," said the old rail
road ' man, "the management decided
that a cut of 10 to 15 per cent in the
wage, schedule affecting subordinate
clerks, agents and the like would be
about the right thing. An official circu
lar announcing the reduction, to be ef
fective on a certain January 1, was Is
sued, and all interested employes re
ceived the notice.
"Of course, there was a great hue
and cry throughout the system. Every
body was talking and, perhaps, doing a
bit of hard swearing. But the days
rolled on and the time was approaching.
"Shortly before the date fixed for the
new order to go Into effect, President
Stanford returned home. Among the
first matters called to the executive's
attention was the wage-cut order.
"Stanford looked it over and turned to
Curtis, then assistant to the general
manager, and said, qulzzingly:
" 'So you think these clerks' pay
ought to be reduced, 'do you?'
" *i"es; there's the proposed sched
ule.'
" "Well, If there's to be any cut,* re
plied Stanford^ let us start at the top
and include Towne, Goodman, Fill
more and the rest of the general of
fice management.'
"Curtis looked at Stanford, slowly
gathered up his papers and retired.
"That was the last ever heard of the
proposed reduction."
While the late Leland Stanford was
president of the old Central Pacific
Railroad Company, he was the idol of
thousands of employes of the system*
Senator Stanford's popularity was in
large measure due to his policy of main,
taining a high wage and salary sched
ule. . His consistent adherence to thi3
doctrine was the cause of no little fric
tion at times, but in his discussions
with other directors of the railroad
President Stanford would invariably
maintain his position.
A former chief clerk In the railroad
employ under the old regime tells the
following story as illustrating Stan
ford's attitude.
Stanford's Methods.
DURING the present special session of Congress
something has happened that vitally interests San
Francisco. We have two members of the House.
They sit and watch things, but the House has been ungrate
ful. One of them got the floor once, but it got away from
him in a few minutes. He saw how things were going. He
felt the fabric of the constitution tumbling into brickbats
around him and he noted the indifference of his fellow mem
bers. He saw the Democratic leader, Mr. Williams, sit un
conscious of what was happening and blithely indifferent to
the distress of the goddess of liberty. Even Champ Clark
swapped jokes with Republicans and ruminated his cud in
fancied security just as if the wreck of matter and the crush
of worlds were not going on right under his nose.
Then our member felt a great purpose quicken within him.
Fate and fortune had made him the Arnold Winkelried of
the crisis. He would rush upon the embattled ranks of the
enemy and receive their spears in the ibreast of his Prince
Albert. To emphasize his heroic mission he would make it
personal to himself alone, and he rose therefore to a ques
tion of personal privilege. Now this kind of rising is only
permitted when the member has been misquoted in that
lively organ, the Congressional Record, or has been misrep
resented in an outside newspaper or has had his name mis
placed on a ro'll call or has been personally attacked on the
floor during his absence. As his eagle eye swept the floor
and the galleries he was called on to state his question of
personal privilege and proceeded to say that he had discov
ered that in the Panama matter the President of the United
States had invaded and destroyed "the prerogative of Con
gress." Before he could proceed further a member moved
to adjourn and the floor slid from under him like a banana
peel.
Woe to an ungrateful House that will. not let our mem
ber rescue it from destruction 1 Woe to seasoned Speaker
Cannon for not letting a member hold the floor to save the
House as a personal privilege 1 Woe to John Sharp Williams
of Mississippi, member of seven Congresses, and to his
Democratic colleagues, Grub Humphreys and Adam Byrd
and Shedric Hill, for letting the floor slipl The House has
fallen upon evil days and nights when even the minority does
not want to be saved. What a legislative Sodom and par
liamentary Gomorrah it is when only one righteous man is
there and he can't hold the floor.
By and by Congress will need to use its prerogative, and
when it feels around for it it will be gone, and then our
member will reap the credit of seeing it go and trying to
grab it and put it back in its place.
POOR OLD CONGRESS.
An ordinance establishing a fine of $500 or imprisonment
for six months for bribing a police officer has been adopted
by the Board of Supervisors. Does this mean that bribery
has become so common as to be cheap, or do the Super
visors wish to impress the idea that the bribery of policemen
is an offense of some seriousness? Can any one suggest a
method of removing the temptation?
"Speaking of human Interest stories,"
said a reporter the other day to a group
of newspaper men, "four years ago I
was shorthand reporter in the District
Attorney's office of Alameda County
and had a desk in the same room with
the genial Harry Melvin, at present the
well known Superior Judge of Alameda
County. Late one afternoon a wealthy
female client, whose acts of generosity
were about as frequent as hens* teeth,
called and said that a family occupying
a Frultvale house of hers was behind
in the rent and she wished them eject
ed. She said the head of the family
was an upholsterer and although
claiming to be 111 was in fact too lazy
to work and for us not to be Imposed
upon by him, as he was shamming.
Judge Melvin made out the usual legal
notice, giving the tenant three days to
leave or suffer ejectment, and asked
me if I would serve the paper. I con
sented, and upon reaching the house
in question I was ushered Into the
main room of the dwelling by a poorly
dressed Spanish woman. It took but
a glance to see that poverty and Illness
were In full control. None of the signs
were missing. An old German, the
master of the house, lay upbn a ragged
lounge In a corner of the otherwise bare
room and the look on his face was that
of resigned despair that follows Ill
ness, but with the acknowledgement
that Illness had won in the game. He
turned an inquiring look in my direc
tion and feebly asked my business. ' I
Btammered something about the paper
I had to serve, but quickly added that
I was sure there was some mistake
and that the - conditions were not
known to the house owner, although I
knew that I. was lying and that they
were well known, or she would not
have given such explicit directions. In
answer the invalid simply said: "Tell
her I shall go as she orde^i within the
next three days." I hurried back to
the office and informed Melvin that the
man was almost beyond the reach even
of charity. He was shocked and said
that in the morning something must
be done at once to relieve the unfor
tunate. But before anything could be
done in the morning word was received
th'at the man was dead. He had gone
before his three days were up. The
next day the landlady called at the
office and inquired: "Well, did you
give him my notice to quit?" I said I
did. She said: "And has he done so?"
I said "Yes." "Ah," she said, "that's
good. "Where did he go to?" I an
swered: "I don't know, madam, but
you and he will never meet In this
life or the next."

value and the trees are so immense that it is impossible to
fell them without breaking and splitting them, so that but
little is left to be sawed even if the commercial value of the
lumber were greater.
It is estimated that petitions for their purchase bearing a
haif'million signatures will go to Congress and the President
as a result of the splendid and intelligent activity of the
league, and it will be difficult to resist an appeal that comes
from so many citizens and from so many parts of the coun
try. The true California spirit is getting a useful advertise
ment in the matter and it will be the pleasure of the press to
aid the league in promoting its great purpose.
In writing In Harper's Magazine for
December of the masked robbers who
Invade the Sahara and are known as
Tawareks, W. T. Harding King tells
of some curious love customs among
these strange people:
"The young Tawarek gallant, mount
ed on his swiftest camel, armed with
sword, dagger and lance," says Mr.
King, "roams the Sahara like a knight
errant of old, protecting and guiding
the caravans under the charge of his
tribe, redressing and avenging the
wrongs done to his slaves and Â¦Â¦ serfs,
or. In order to bring glory to his lady
love, whose gage d'amour he wears,
and to find the necessary dowry to set
tle upon her, engaging In adventurous
forays upon his neighbors' herds and
the caravans under the protection of
the neighboringr tribes.
"From time to time, when. an oppor
tunity occurs, he sends a letter to his
adored, giving. In a somewhat vain
glorious tone, an account of himself
and his exploits. â¢ The letters are writ
ten In the old 'characters of the Ber
ber alphabet, which at the present day
Is In use among the Tawareks alone.
They are sometimes Illustrated with
rough but spirited drawings -of the in
cidents referred to! Occasionally they
are written In cipher, of which the
writer and the recipient alone possess
the key, and not infrequently they take
the form of a short poem addressed by
the absent Tawarek to his inamorata."
Pirates of the SaJtara.
SOME interesting results have followed the effort of the
Outdoor League to induce the Federal Government to :
purchase the Calavcras big trees. The league has
asked the co-operation of college presidents and Governors
of States all over , the Union. The favorable replies show
that this effort, local to California, has been the means of re
newing national interest in the subject of forestry.- When
the Governors of Vermont and of South Carolina concur in
offering their active support of the project there is offered
evidence that the big trees have become a, national issue
and the means of inducing a general movement in behalf of
all trees and of all forests.
It is proposed that the Government expend- five millions
in acquiring continuous forests in the Appalachian Moun
tains to reserve them as a protection of the watershed and a
scenic feature. A movement is also started to preserve the
forests in the White Mountains in New' Hampshire, which
have recently been invaded by sawmills and are rapidly fol
lowing the long disappeared forests on the lower slopes of
the 6ame mountains. We can well afford to make dbmmon
cause with all these movements. ' A country stripped of its
forests rapidly declines in its fertility and offers less and less
shelter and advantages for the homes of its people. 1
The Appalachian forests have been persistently passing to
the axman since the, famine in pine and hard timber fell upon
the country by the' destruction of the white pine of Michigan,
Wisconsin and' Minnesota, and the oak, maple, ash, hickory
and other hard woods of Indiana, New York and Ohio.
There is a great dearth of cooper stock and wagon timber
because the harvest has been destructive. Had the hard
wood forests :Jbeen properly cut under the direction of expert
foresters the supply .would have been preserved. There is
yet a chance to save much that would be carelessly sacrificed
and ; our Outdoor League is to.be congratulated upon having
sounded a note that is just in harmony, with- such a general
and widespread sentiment.
There is "noTdoubV that* the Calaverav trees will : be saved;
The , private owner will not be T in a hurry to convert thenr
into poor lumber. They are 'worth i more to ' him standing
than sawed, for that species of sequoia has not much timber
SAVING THE BIG TREES.
The Americanization of Hawaii is progressing rapidly to
inevitable success. The grand jury of Honolulu busied it
self recently in an investigation of alleged election frauds.
The inquiry ended with the verdict, made in opposition to
the opinions of the natives of the jury, that absolutely no
evidence of fraud could be found. Can anything more ap
propriately American be suggested?
But the aggregated power which can
be furnished by all of America's great
waterfalls Is insignificant compared to
the possibilities which lie In the con
trolled energy which can be stored up
by the winds and waves. Motors actu.
ated by the waves of the ocean and the
great lakes are in Bight. The limitless
power of the waves and tides trans
formed Into electrical energy, which
can be transmitted by copper or alumi
num wires far Inland, is not the dream
of a visionary. Hydraulic engineers de
clare that the day is near which will
find wires radiating from points all
along the coast line of the United
States, each wire pulsating with Its
burden of wave-started electricity. Ti
dal mills and pumps operated by wave
moved floats have been in service in a
email way for some years, â¢ but they
have not proved- to be satisfactory.
Some months ago plans for a tide
water power development on a large
Audacious engineers are scheming to
put an electric belt on the father of
waters. The plans contemplate a dam
across the Mississippi River at Keokuk,
Iowa, for a hydraulic plant capable of
developing 50.000 electrical horse-power.
The falls of the Ohio at Louisville, Ky.,
will be grinding out electricity if pres
ent plans are realized. Niagara Falls
for some years has been driving Im
mense turbines. Seattle and Tacoma
draw their electricity from waterfalls,
miles distant, and the mountain cas
cades In California furnish power
which is carried a hundred and more
miles to the place of consumption. ;
Chicago is called the "Windy City,"
not alone because of the supposed lung
power of its optimistic citizens, but be
cause its average wind velocity â and
there is always wind blowing over Chi
cago â is sixteen miles an hour. Last
year Franklin H. Head, one of the
city's leading citizens, in a lecture de
livered before the students of the Uni
versity of Chicago, made the sugges
tion that the city could be electrically
lighted by building a cordon of wind
mills around it, each mill pumping elec
tricity into a storage battery. The elec
tricians viewed the proposition with
some doubt â they said a practical stor
age, battery which could be charged by
a windmill driven dynamo was not on â¢
the market. But now it is proposed to
couple the windmills with air compres
sors, to store up energy for operating
the machinery of the Innumerable
Email shops and factories, and the air
compressor men declare the proposition
is practical. An experimental plant is
to be installed and if It proves success
ful every sky scraper in the Windy City
soon may be crowned with a tiara of
whirligigs jamming compressed air into
reservoirs, storing up mechanical en
ergy night and day.
The electric arc Is taking the place
of coke and charcoal for reducing iron
from its ores in blast furnaces. The j
electric furnaces are yet in the expert- j
mental stage, but they are doing the j
work, and no one. In these years, when
every day has its industrial revolution
and scientific revelation, dares act the
skeptic or play the scoffer. "Wherever ;
water fa!Is there is power, and to-day â¢
the hydraulic, electrical and mechanical !
engineers and the metallurgist arc j
working together to make electricity
do the work of coal and coke in the
manufacture cf iron, copper and other
useful metals. Waterfalls in the wil
derness have been harnessed to great
dynamos which are sending the elec
trical current to cities 100 and 150 miles
away. They are utilizing the electrical
current in furnaces to fuse the clays
â¢which imprison aluminum and to bring
together in the fierce heat of the elec
trical arc the elements in lime and
powdered coal â¢ which combine to make
the calcium carbide which gives forth
acetelyne gas when touched by water.
The electric current welds iron and
fuses sand for making glass, and this
current works the same whether it
comes but a few feet from a dynamo
driven by a stationary engine or Is
brought scores of miles through forests
and over mountains from a waterfall.
Improvements in steam engines and
boilers, all tending to get more power
out of a ton of coal, follow each otfcei
so rapidly that before one Is fairly on
the market another is urging its claims.
In short, the world's progress is In the
direction which warrants the belief
that in a few generations the question,
"How much longer will the world's coal
supply last?" will be of live interest
only to geologists â the power user will
not be much concerned.
Th<Â» discussion as to how long the
world's coal supply will last serves to
direct attention to the fact that every
-year the industrial world is get tin's
away from the use of coal in many
lines. It is not too venturesome to sug
gest that the present generation may
see the 3cng-distance transmission of
electrical energy, generated from dy
namos driven by water power, devel
oped to s'ich a degree that coal will not
be used for power producing purposes
except in the immediate proximity of
the mines. Makers cf windmilis and
other forms of motors driven by air
currents say that before many years
the land will be thickly studded with
windmill towers, each wheel lifting wa
ter, operating a dynamo or driving an
air compressor, transforming the wind
into useful forms of energy.

Our universities cannot put too much stress upon the im
portance of agriculture as a scientific calling. When it is
known that science can breed corn and wheat and all field
crops to secure greater excellence and therefore better re
turns the necessity for the best training appears. We have
recently spoken of the great lack and the crying need of
trained vegetable physiologists and pathologists. When
they appear every tiller of the soil will acquire a better
knowledge of the constitution and the diseases of plant life.
It is the duty of every university to teach its students that
ownership and scientific care of the soil and its crops is one
of the most useful and most necessary of human occupa
tions.
The old legend, derived from the Assyrians and by them'
from some older race far the other side of the beginning of
history, planted the human race in a garden, not in a bank,
nor a lawyer's office, nor a doctor's apartments. It was the
expression of a sense of the ultimate foundation of things.
When high school and college men with trained minds, self
centered and able to think their way through a proposition
to a logical conclusion, seek the soil for a livelihood we will
hear less about the loss of farm profits during the transfer
of the product from the producer to the consumer. If every
orchard and vineyard planter in California had the benefit of
such training, making him wise not only in producing but
in the commercial branch of his business and in the law
which rightly invoked protects him, does any one suppose
that outside investigation would be invoked and outside help
accepted to protect him and the consumer from the trained
rapacity which intervenes between them? ;â¢â¢;,:
Agriculture has been too long left out of the dys of occu
pations which require special training. As its fruits must
support the life of the world they should not be left to the
rule of thumb and the. law of haphazard. The mission of the
United States to feed and clothe tj^ world is becoming
plainer as older populations increase and the product of the
soil_ declines. We can get along with no better lawyers or
'doctors than other lands have, but we cannot get along
without better trained agriculturists.
IN the past it has been customary to point to the number
of men who have achieved success though lacking in
education. It is to be noted that the success in such
cases has been in the line of money making. But that is not
the only success in life, nor is money making the noblest
achievement in life. There are other things of greater worth
to the world, such as steadiastness to great principles, the
betterment oi man by the study of the resources of nature,
the narrowing of the iield in 'which superstition enchains the
mind, all are worthy objects of endeavor.
'But in mere money making in the future the trained man
is to have an advantage over the untrained. Mere scholar
ship is not all that is needed. The proper study of mankind
is man. The country is receiving an enormous annual incre
ment of illiterate immigration. It is the material upon
which the American mind must work to achieve the suc
cesses of the future. The mind that trains it in things other
than burden bearing, that uses its brawn to develop wealth,
but at the same time has human touch with it beyond its
brawn, to assimilate its ideas with our ideals, is to be the in
fluence.that saves the republic from destruction.
Americans need a training that does not lead so generally
to the professions. The dignity of labor is as great as in
the days of our fathers. Avenues to all occupations must be
held open and kept free. With the training that precedes
special instruction in the professions men are better qualified
for any of the skilled manual occupations. The art of the
blacksmith and carpenter, of the electrician, the stone and
brick mason, is equal to the so-called learned professions.
In another direction the art of tilling the soil, of getting
from it the best fruits of the field and orchard and vine
yard, has risen to rank equal with the professions. When
President McKinley was here and the members of his Cabi
net attended the commencement exercises at Berkeley only
one graduate of the Agricultural School appeared and that
was a lady. Associating agriculture with the plow and prun
ing hook, the students indulged in a rather derisive out
burst to the confusion of the lady agriculturist. But Mr.
Wilson, the wise farmer at the head of the Agricultural De
partment of the Government, turned this feeling into one of
respect when he welcomed the lady and spoke not only of
the dignity but the high scientific standing of modern agri
culture.
Owing to the relation of the great
Iron mines to the great coal mines of
the country, the region of the Great
Lakes is now the most economical place
for the manufacture of Iron. The great
problem of the century is to bring to
gether the Iron ore of the Lake Superior
district and the coal of the Appalachian
region. Since in the smelting of iron
about two tons of ore are required for
one ton of coke, the ports on the Great
Lakes which can be entered by large
vessels from Lake Superior, and which
can be reached by the shortest haul
from the Appalachian coal fields, have
.a permanent advantage which It would
seem cannot be taken away from them
In all the future.

The anthracite coal of Eastern Penn
sylvania is but a small remnant of the
original coal fields preserved in a few
synclinal basins, or hollows, produced
during the wrinkling up of the surface
In the formation of the mountains, and
;which have escaped the action of the
extensive denuding agencies which
have transformed the region. These
fields probably formerly extended en
tirely across the Susquehanna Valley
to join the bituminous fields in the
western part of the State. But the por
tion of the strata that were folded up
has been worn away, while that which
was In the bottom part of the folds has
remained. It follows that almost every
where they have to go down to get the
coal. The answer of a' mining expert
to the farmer who lived on the eroded
portion and wished to know how deep
down he should have to bore to find
coal contains a whole lesson in geology.
"My friend," he said, "to find coal on
your farm you must go up into the air
about 2000 feet.' 1 This contortion of the
rocks and dislocation of the strata in
coal regions gives great trouble to min
ers and calls for the highest degree of
geological knowledge on the part of
mining engineers. Frequently the coal
seam will run out against a bare wall
of rock, when it becomes a question
whether one is to go up or down to find
the dislocated end, and in either event
a vast amount of expense is involved.
In North America the coal measures
are distributed about as follows: In
the Appalachian field, 60,000 square
miles; in the central field, 47,000; in the
western, 78,000; in Michigan, 6700; In
Rhode Island, 500; while in Nova Scotia
there are 18,000. On account of the
thickness of the seams and the quality
of the coal, the Appalachian field is
probably the most important in the
world. In Pottsville, Pa., the total
thickness of the workable seams of coal
is more than 100 feet, and this Is an
thracite, which has been so subjected
to heat and pressure that all the bitu
minous and volatile matters have been
removed, so that it becomes the most
valuable fuel in the world. Its smoke
less character gives to our Eastern
cities, where it is principally used, an
advantage which is almost incalculable.
The Pittsburir coal seam is one of the
most remarkable in the world, being
from fifteen to twenty feet In thickness,
and extending over' several * thousand
square miles, and being exposed on the
banks of a navigable river, where It can
be mined with the least difficulty. It is
of such purity, also, that when made
Into coke by burning in kilns to expel
the volatile matter, it is the best coal
in the world for use in the manufacture
of Iron.
While some scientists are wondering
what will happen when coal gives out,
others are working and experimenting
to eliminate waste, decrease friction,
save heat and take up lost motion, to
the end that one ton of coal will do
what two tons of coal couldn't do.
Smoking chimneys are looked upon as
the visible signs of prosperity; as a
matter of fact, they are unfailing in
dications of waste and needless ex
pense. The sequence of improvements
in steam-using machinery, the utiliza
tion of nature's forces for industrial
purposes and the almost daily invention
of new methods and revolutionary ap
pliances all lead to one end â smokeless
factory chimneys and a corresponding
reduction In the world's coal bill.

Sol Getz & Son report that the un
willingness of the United Railroads
Company to lower the railroad tracks
on H street, between Forty-fifth and
Forty-eighth avenues, until the whole
width of the street was put on the
grade necessarily delayed the contract
or from proceeding with his work. Now
that a permit has been granted by the
Board of Public Works to the owners
of the blocks the railroad company will
be compelled to lower the tracks to the
official grade and the street work will
be rapidly pushed to completion, there
by assisting the progressive movement
so recently inaugurated by the resi
dents of the Oceanside district. Sol
Getz & Son will also now have- the
chance to finish completing the grading
of their blocks in tha^t locality, . which
is anxiously being awaited by the pur
chasers of lots, who will erect* homes.'

Evidence of this was furnished yes
terday by the filing of a suit against
the promoters of the concern to com
pel them to pay into the hands of. a
receiver appointed for the purpose the
money they subscribed when the com
pany was first organized. She says
they still owe the company $1,200,000.
The directors of : the concern are
Charles Lane, Alvinza Hayward, H. G.
Stevenson, J. D. Arnold and A. * J. Ul
mann. General C. P. Egan, who at
tended to the promotion of the interests
of the company in Mexico and who, in
the first suit, is accused by Mrs. Black
of being a party to the alleged scheme
to defraud the bondholders, is not a de
fendant in yesterday's action. He was
not one of the subscribers to the orig

America boasts of her rallways^ â but
is railway traffic in England any safer
thanin this. country? Recent statistics
of the two Governments seem to show
that it is. Last year 1171 persons were
killed and 17,814 injured in railway ac
cidents In the United Kingdom; 3064
were killed and 42,113 Injured in the
United States. J But there are 202,471
miles ' of railroad in this country, as
against only 22,152 miles In 'the United
Kingdom. The significant features are
that, of every 9,211,022 passengers car
ried on, English railways last year, one
was. killed, - but. on. American railways
the ratio was 1,883,706 to one. It would
seem, therefore, that the lives of pas
sengers traveling on English railways
are. about five times as secure as on
American roads. The official flgure3
show that, of every - 466,700 - passengers
in the United . Kingdom . last year, one
was Injupfed,, and that. of. every 97,244
in the United States, one was injured.
In the Amerlca'n statistics of killed
and Injuredâ if not In the British â the
list, includes of all kinds,

on trains or walking oh or crossing

SAN RAFAEL, Nov. 28.â Owing to
errors in the court records Fook Yook,
a Chinese murderer, will probably gain
his liberty. After over; twenty years'
Incarceration without friends or money,
Samaritans from China have come to
his assistance, and every effort, will -be
made to make Fook a free man.
An attorney. In San Francisco - 'Â¦ has
charge of the case. From investigation
he found that no commitment was ever
entered or judgment roll ever filed and
tha^ no minutes of the trial ever were
kept. The only record of the case at
all is' the filing of the Justice'B Court
proceedings and the filing of an infor
mation of murder in the Superior
Court. These errors may substantiate
the ground for release.
Fook Yook was . sent to San Quentin
in January, 1882, to serve twenty years
for robbery in San. Francisco.. In No
vember of the same year Yook killed a
fellow inmate. The trial was in Marln
County before Judge Bowers. After

A few minutes before jumping into

The Judgment of the lower court is
again reversed and a new trial is. or
dered. The opinion is written by Jus
tice Shaw, with whom Chief Justice
Beatty and Justices McFarland. Van
Dyke, Henshaw, Lorigan and Angel
lotti concur.
It Is said that the trouble over water
percolations is only just beginning and
that the rule cannot be laid down per
mitting the person with the deepest
well and the strongest apparatus to
have all the water in his neighborhood,
even if he does operate from his own
real estate. The court asserts that
there is no necessary parallel between
oil and water percolations and the for
mer Question need not be decided at
this time. Â»
. The Supreme Court handed down a
decision in the famous "percolation"
case yesterday, reaffirming its previous
judgment and order. The arguments
of former Justice Temple are sup
ported, but the decree is so modified as
to exclude the oil feature of the ques
tion.
The plaintiffs in the suit are Leah J.
Katz, executrix of the estate of Marcus
Katz; A. D. Allison, R. M. Tyler and
William McDonald. Margaret D.
Walkinshaw is the defendant. The pe
titioners owned an artesian well in San
Be/nardino County. The defendants,
who owned adjoining property, also
constructed an artesian well. The re
sult was that the Katz well produced
less water than formerly. The trial
court granted a nonsuit and an appeal
was taken to the Supreme Court. Jus
tice Temple wrote an opinion, in which
the majority of the court concurred,
declaring that the plaintiffs had a
cause for action. The decision was
general in its terms and the law as in
terpreted would have applied to oil as
well as water properties.
Ten different petitions for a rehear
ing were granted. It Is argued by the
defendant that in common law the
landowner has the right to take what
ever water he can from his property.
The court declares that common law
must be adjusted to prevailing condi
tions. It is then shown in the opinion
that the peculiar geological formation
of the State, the absence of water In
certain localities and the pressing
need of moisture to insure the future
prosperity of California combine , to
force a liberal interpretation of the
satutes.
Some time ago Chief Wittman re
ceived a letter from Chief Elton of Los
Angeles that Lytton was wanted for
stealing his wife's valuable Jewelry.
Detectives Ed Gibson and Reynolds
were detailed on the case, but they
found no trace of Lytton till Friday.
Applications were being received on
Friday at the office of the United Rail
roads for men and the detectives think
ing that Lytton might be an applicant,
went there. Sure enough, Lytton made
his appearance and was quickly placed
under arrest.
Chief Elton was notified and Chief
Wittman received a reply yesterday
morning that an officer had left to take
Lytton back. A few hours later the
Chief received a dispatch from Mrs.
Lytton to release her husband, as she
Â¦would not prosecute him, and that she
would leave on the Owl train. Lytton
was not released and his wife will have
to f.ght out the matter of his release
with the Los Angeles officer. .
Lytton, after taking his wife's
Jewelry, went to Seattle about six
months ago and remained there till a
Jew days ago. when he came to this
city. He told the detectives that all of
his wife's Jewelry had been disposed of
and he had lost the money in gambling.
He was visited by his wife's sister yes
terday afternoon and she said that he
might as well be released, as Mrs. Lyt
ton was very fond of him and would
not prosecute him.
George W. Lytton, a streetcar con
ductor, is in the City Prison and an
officer from Los Angeles is on his way
to take him back there, while his wife
s is on another train hurrying here to
have him released from custody, she

him.

The Board of Education issued a cir
cular of information yesterday, to prin
cipals and. teachers, in which it is stat
ed that the .winter vacation \ for the
public schools â¢will, begin Monday, De
cember 21; and end Monday, ' January
11. : The Â« circular also . states that the
incoming t City Attorney will s be ! asked
for. his opinion as to the legality, of.in
creasing the* teachers'; salaries ;$2 -. a
month, such increase to r be applied, to
the annuity fund, instead' of the Know,
deducted from their monthly pay. If
this can be legally done it is hoped
that the Board of : Supervisors will
grant the Increased appropriation, thus
placing the .fund on an absolutely sta
ble foundation.
The . proposition of the .teachers, to
contribute monthly $1 additional to the
annuity fund was defeated, only 382
out of the 906 contributors voting for
it. The circular continues:
"Principals will see that the usual
instructions to janitors for work dur
ing vacation are carried out,. as per de
tails in 'circular No. 8, June. 4, 1903. .
"Salary demands for December will
be paid December 23. â¢
"Principals are requested to send in
at, once .the .names of their probable
graduates.".
The following resolution* has been
passed by the board: '"Resolved, That
not less than twenty (20) minutes' in
struction during each school week shall
be given in all the primary, grammar
and high school grades in the elements
of physiology and hygiene with special
reference to the effect of alcohol and
narcotics on the human system, and
that the principals and teachers be re
quired to include in instruction the
correct use of the emergency roll and
first aid to the injured that has Just
been supplied to all the classes."

than the Monday following the end of

The attention of principals was again
called' to 'the following paragraph'-in
circular No. 10: "Admit no new pupil
to your - school â¢ who lives - nearer an
other school with: the same grade for
two .weeks, after the opening of each
school term. Admit no such: pupil Â¦ at
any time when he would cause the en
rollment' of the class to exceed, fifty

Tax Collector Smith and Treasurer
McDougald held a consultation yester
day afternoon and decided to appeal to
the incoming Board of -Supervisors to
make provision under the State law for
the payment of the premiums on their
official bonds. The present Board of
Supervisors refused to pay McDbu
gald's premium on the ground that the
city would have to pay the premiums
on the bonds of all city officials. The
board rather resented the action of the
Legislature in passing a law which is
deemed an invasion of this city's right
to govern itself. As Mayor Schmitz is
Inclined to exact surety bonds from the
Treasurer and Tax Collector only, it Is
probable that the next Board of Super
visors will provide the necessary funds
to pay the. premiums on the bonds of
those two officials in the next munici
pal budget. In the event that such ac
tion will not be taken Tax Collector
Smith expressed his intention to follow
Dodge's example and insist that his
bond with personal sureties be accepted.
;.â¢ "I understand that the .surety; com
panies have been 'holding up' city of
ficials in the matter of premiums on
bonds, and I deem it my.duty in, order
to '.. prevent .this condition . to . approve
any bond 'sufficiently secured by per
sonal sureties. I; do not think that our
city officers should be' subjected to any
extortion, in this matter,;and in order
to escape the grasping tendencies of the
surety companies the only course' left
is for me to accept adequate personal
security on official iJonds. .1 am dis
posed to make exceptions 'in the cases
of the Tax .Collector and* the City
Treasurer, as their responsibilities are
great." ' "". :
â¢^ " MAY SECURE BELIEF.
.Dodge presented Â¦'his ,bond to the
Mayor with James D. Phelan and Louis
Rosenfeld as sureties, and after it had
been drafted to make the responsibility
of the sureties ironclad the Mayor
stated that N he would approve it. .
The next city official to follow
Dodge's example Vas Samuel Braun
hart, who was re-elected Supervisor.
Braunhart filed a bond with Samuel
Nickelsberg and Lewis. Meyerstein as
sureties, and after a few minor altera
tions have been made in its phraseol
ogy Mayor Schmitz will approve it.
â¢ HEAVY BOND PBEMITJMS.
It is quite likely that the Mayor will
require.. the Tax Collector' and the
Treasurer to continue furnishing a
"surety bond, as they 'handle large sums
of money belonging to the city. Treas
urer McDougald pays $500 yearly, as a
premium on his bond, but says he will
continue to do so, as he would require
four bondsmen and in all likelihood
would have to give up some^places in
his office for the favor. Tax Collector
Smith pays $400 yearly as a premium
on his. bond. â¢ J. '
-In . discussing the matter Mayor
Schmitz said: *
It having been brought to the atten
tion of Mayor Schmitz that the surety
companies have formed a combine to
raise the premiums on bonds furnished
to city officials, his Honor decided yes
terday to approve bonds given by per
sonal sureties which comply in all re
spects with charter requirements. As
told in last Sunday's Call, Assessor
Dodgre was the first official to rebel at
the exactions of the surety companies,
which have doubled the premium on his
bond of $50,000.

AT an early hour this morning The Call established the identity of the burglar that was shot
Â§nd killed by Policeman James H. Smith' in Oakland. His name was Frank- J. Golden
stein. He did not come from the East, as vva^ supposed by thepoiice, but came to Oakland
from Southern California several weeks ago. His movements have been traced and it was ascer
tained that after leaving the southern part of the State Goldenstein came to San Francisco. â¢ He
roomed for some time at a' lodging-house on Tenth street, and it is, supposed that he and his
"pal," who escaped, are responsible for numerous crimes committed in San Francisco and Oak
land during the last month. . .

they could verify his statement by tele

Saulsbury's statement. Saulsbury was
at once released, with an apology from
Captain Martin.
.Quigley was asked when taken to
headquarters if he' had the murderous
burglar. ! He was ' non-committal, but
there was an exultant look on his face
that spoke volumes. He said he would
reserve any statement till he . took his
prisoner to Oakland. He went to lunch

There ' is little * question but that the
men ; who were 'stopped - by Policeman
Smith were ; the ones who have : been
doing; some if not all of the work in
and about Oakland; for the last month.
There is every : indication that they
are- "porch I climbers," for the marks
upon the shoes and clothing of the
dead man^would indicate this. '.The
fact that the ; dead man was armed
with both revolver and knife -arid that
the* escaped ' man Â¦ did not hesitate to
Â¦hoot ' show^ that^.they* were desperate
characters. ? Yet ; neither : of 'them could
have Â¦ been more : , than * 22 years of age.

WERE ACTIVE, THIEVES.
But the police are not naying much
attention to any of the clothing, marks,
and Chief of Police Hodgklns said, to
night: â¢
"We are not working upon the laun
dry; mark- or the clothing mark. They
don't amount to anything."
But while the name oh the underwear
is undoubtedly correct, the questions
the police are ti-ylng to solve are: r What
were his antecedents and what was his
record? . ,
One of the strange -features of the
case is the fact that several hundred
people from Oakland "and San Fran
cisco have viewed the remains of the
dead burglar without recognizing him.
Half of- the detective force of San
Francisco visited the Oakland Morgue
to-day, but not one; of them was able
to say that they knew the man or had
any clew to his identity. There was.
much speculation, but no information..
Some thought that they saw -in his
hands the indications -of: his . having
been a railroad -man. Others pointed
to the fact that j his â¢ arms as far up
as the elbows, were sunburned as if he
had been working in a field with his
sleeves rolled up.
But there was. nothing .found upon
the body that would assist in unrav-'
eling the mystery save a little piece
of white tap* 1 on r his underwear bear
ing the name "Goldstein" in . indelible
Ink. There was also -the laundry mark
"H x IB." The clothing gave evi
dence that the maiTmight; have . come
from 'either New York or San Fran
cisco. The coat bore the mark, "A1-
fred Benjamin & Co., makers. New
York." The red and green sweater was
marked "J. J. Pflster Knitting Co., S.
F." This would indicate that the man
originally came from New York and
refitted In San' Francisco.

Walter Withers of 3935 Howe street.
He. had been delivering a parcel at the
residence of Charles ,E. Palmer, in front
of whose house the shooting occurred.
He says: .
j "When I came out of the house I saw

stopped bythe policeman at the corner.
He asked them where they lived and
where they were going. .One. man said
that they. lived in the'southern part of
Oakland and that they were going orr
the other, side of the lake. The police
man said that he would have to arrest
them upon suspicion. One of the men
stepped back arid the firing began. I
don't know, who fired first." .

they were of the most desperate type.

against their will in the last twenty
four hours than ever before in the same
space of^time. Every man. that ap
proaches the description of the missing

OAKLAND, Novr. 28. â The burglar
that killed Policeman James H. Smith
and who escaped last night after the
killing Is still. missing, the dead bur
glar is still unidentified though Viewed
by hundreds from Oakland and San
Francisco, and the mournful arrange
ments are being made for the funeral
of the brave young policeman who died
in the performance of his duty. These
are the results of the work of the day
following the duel in the dark that took
place on Jackson street last night. The
police of Oakland and San- Francisco
have been making unusual efforts to
locate the escaped man. as he, not the
dead burglar, caused the death of Po
liceman Smith.
People who think that they know the
dead man are beginning to appear, but
none of them have furnished anything
of any value as yet. L. Blodgett, a real
estate dealer in East Oakland, believes
that the man tried to buy property
from him yesterday, but the police
think that the men were hardly looking
for investments In real estate. Mary
Flnley thinks' that she gave the dead
man some food yesterday at 5 oclock,

"This contest, as we understand It,
prows out of these facts: In December,
1S41. the late Alexander Boyd, over
whose estate the controversy arises,
was married to Margaret Anderson, the
contestant here, at Philadelphia, Pa.,
and lived with her there until about
1S45 or 1S46. Mr. Boyd then followed
the trade of a carpenter, and in 1846,
with a view of bettering his condition,
he sold what little property he had and
turned the proceeds over to his wife,
except sufficient to pay his traveling
expenses, and leaving her in Philadel
phia, as she was then in delicate
health, went to Pensacola, Fla., where
]ie obtained employment at his trade
in the Government shipyards at better
v.ares than were obtainable in Phila
delphia. He lived there, until 1849,
when, gold being discovered in Califor
nia, he came directly to this State and
eventually settled in Sacramento.
9< A few months after leaving Phila
delphia he learned from his wife that
a son had been born to them and from
lime to time sent her means for her
support and that of their child, who
had been named Thomas W. Boyd.
BEFTJSED TO SOTS BHJSBA2TD.
"On several occasions after coming to
this State and during the first years of
his residence here Mr. Boyd requested
his wife to come to him and make their
home in California, offering to send her
the means to make the journey, but
she interposed objections and refused
to come. Thereafter. In 1836. from rela
tives in Philadelphia Mr. Boyd received
the information that bis wife had, in
June of that year, entered Into a second
marriage with one Henry Hollowbush
at Philadelphia and that she was then
living with him in that city. He imme
diately made investigation and ascer
tained that this information was cor
rect, and thereupon he at once com
menced an action against his wife for
divorce on the ground of adultery. This
action was brought in the old District
Court of the Sixth Judicial District at
Sacramento, and, the wife not being in
this State, the summons, as the law
required in such cases, was served by
publication and by sending a copy of
the summons and complaint by mail to
the wife at Philadelphia. Depositions
in the case were thereafter taken at
Philadelphia, and personal notice of the
taking Â«5f the depositions ' was served
upon Mrs. Boyd. as appears from the
affidavits on file In the case. These
depositions show that she had been
married to Hollowbush on the 11th day
of June, 1E36 â the marriage having: been
publicly solemnized at the Tenth Bap
tist Church in that city â and that she
was at the time of the taking of the
depositions Hying with Hollowbush as
his wife. ,
WIFE FAILED TO A2TSWER.
OBDZBS DEPOSITION TAKEN".
Probate Judge Coffey has issued an
order that the deposition of the alleged
widow- in Philadelphia be taken and
pending this the distribution of the es
tate is tied up.
Garret McEnerney and Judge C. Van

widow of Boyd. while Lloyd &. Wood
and Bishop, Wheeler &. Hoeffler repre-
Fcnt the woman in Philadelphia who
claims to be the legal widow of the de
ceased capitalist.
Van Fleet and McEnerney authorized
the Issuance of the following statement
covering the disputed facts in the case
of the estate of Boyd:
A peculiar circumstance in the case
is tha.t the first wife of Boyd. from
whom he secured a divorce in 1S57, has
fcince that time been the presumed
wife of Henry Hallowbush of Philadel
phia and until a few weeks ago she
took no steps to set aside the decree of
divorce secured by Boyd against her.
The woman, who for forty-seven
years has presumably been the wife of
Hallowbush, now comes forward and
declares that the divorce Boyd secured
from her is invalid on technical
grounds and she claims to be entitled
to c one-half of the estate of the dead
capitalist.
Boyd, who was declared incompetent
three years ago, left all his estate to
his widow and her two sons. The'wid
ow petitioned the Probate Court for a
distribution of the estate on September
2S last and a few days afterward the
first wife of Boyd filed an answer be
fore Judge CoiTey, claiming that she
was the legal widow of Boyd and en
titled to one-half of his estate.
The estate of the late capitalist,
Alexander Boyd, who died on February
& last, is the subject of a controversy
in which two women figure as widows,
each claiming a share of the vast prop
erty left by the deceased.

Russell Sage, who knew something
about Huntington and his large inter

at between $20,000,000 and J30.000.000.

figures than any made. It is shown by
the appraisement that Huntington left
a gross personal estate of $35,594,586 In
this State and gross real estate of $1,

It shows that the . estimates made

as vre understand it, based solely upon
the ground that by reason of certain
alleged defects of purely a technical
nature in the divorce proceedings at
Sacramento, that decree of divorce Is
void, and that as a result Mr. Boyd
was never legally divorced from her;
that as a result she is in law his widow,
and entitled as such to take, as com
munity property, one-half of all the
large amount of property accumulated
by Mr. Boyd during the intervening
years, while she has been living with
her second husband, Hollowbush.
The widow of Mr. Boyd, to whom the
estate has been largely left, does not
apprehend ' any real difficulty in de-.
featlng any such claÂ«m."

CLAIM IS TECHNICAL ONE.
ent Mrs. Boyd, formerly Miss Jean Mc-
Gregor of Sacramento, by whom he had
two sons, George D. Boyd and Henry
SL Clair Boyd. Shortly after his sec
ond marriage Mr. Boyd removed to San
Francisco, where he and his family
continued to reside until Mr. Boyd's
death. In February last, and where his
widow and her two sons still reside.
"After his second marriage Mr. Boyd
sent for his son by his first wife,
Thomas W. Boyd, then a lad, and
reared and educated him in his home
here. This son subsequently married
and at his death left a widow and two
children, for whom Mr. Boyd made
provision in his will. /'"'
"During the forty-six years between
the entry of the decree of divorce from
his first wife and the death of Mr.
Boyd, his former wife took no proceed
ings to set aside the decree of divorce,
and â¢ did not In any way question
its validity, but \ continued to live
and, as we are informed, has ever since
been living, with her second husband,
Hollowbueh.
Alexander Garnett, the man who killed
Major McClung in the apartments of
Mrs. Coit at the Palace Hotel last Wed
nesday night, presented a pitiful ap
pearance in Judge Fritz's courtroom
yesterday morning. He was very pale
and showed the effects of worry and
imprisonment. He sat beside William
H. Alford, his counsel, and manifested
keen interest in the proceedings. The
courtroom was crowded.
Attorney Alford was unprepared, as
he had been engaged by the defendant
at midnight. He was anxious to obtain
a postponement. Judge Fritz took the
case up as soon as he opened court. As
soon as he called the case of the people
vs. Garnett, counsel for the prisoner
made his motion for a continuance. He
based it on the ground that neither the
police nor any one else had filed a com
plaint against his client Mr. Alford
further stated that he deeired to con
sult Mr. Garnett and arrartge his de
fense. He therefore asked that the
case go over until next Tuesday. .
Judge Fritz looked over his calendar
and agreed to the request. Garnett
gave a sigh of relief as he left the
courtroom. He was taken upstairs and
lodged in the City Prison.
Detective Ryan was detailed by Chief
of Detectives Martin to call upon Mrs.
McClung and ask her to swear to a
complaint charging Alexander Garnett
with the murder of Major McClung.
Owing to the funeral yesterday Detec
tive Ryan was unable to see the widow.
An effort will be made to have Mrs.
Coit swear to the complaint. If both
women refuse to do so, the Police De
partment will take the initiative.
Mrs. Coit is still confined to her room
at the Palace Hotel and is unable to
see any one. She is highly nervous and
has slept very little since the terrible
tragedy. Physicians are In constant
attendance.
Major McClung's body was cremated
yesterday afternoon. The funeral was
private, only the immediate relatives
of the deceased being present. Rev. F.
W. Clampett. rector of Trinity Church,
officiated.

Walter M. Chord, who gave his occu
pation . as a blacksmith, was arrested
last evening by Policemen Cullinane
and O'Connell and charged with bur
glary at the Central police station- The
complaint against him was made by"
Oran Lynch, a student residing at 200
Turk street. Chord confessed to the
crime and pleads intoxication, although
such a defense is not consistent with
the facts of the case.
Chord entered young Lynch's /oora
last Sunday. He toc-k a clock and an
overcoat containing a bankbook show
ing $430 to young Lynch's credit In the
Hibernian Bank. On Monday the thief
appeared at the bank and attempted to
draw $295, but his suspicious' actions
were ..noted by the paying teller, who
refused to make the payment and took
up the. book. When Lynch came to the
bank later, he was informed of the oc
currence and made a report to the po
lice immediately. . .,'- ' Â¦;.
Early Monday morning, after â¢com
mitting the crime. Chord visited Lynch
In his room and asked him ; If his: over-'
coat was missing. â¢ Lynch was sur
prised to find that such was the case,
but the burglar put his fears at rest by
informing him that his uncle, Thomas
King, had taken it on the previous aft
ernoon. It appears that Chord met
King on Sunday afternoon near Lynch's
room, struck up an acquaintance and
learner! the maiden name of Lvnch's
mother, which information he used in
the attempt to draw money on the
bankbook next day. Chard's object In
telling Lynch that his uncle had the
cotit was to prevent him from making a
complaint to the police before he had
an cppoituijily oi producing the book
at the bank.

SOLOMONVILLE, Ariz., Nov. 28.â
The Graham County authorities have
just been advised of a fight on Eagle
Creek, In which three ranchers put a
sudden stop to the career of two cow
thieves and outlaws, members of the
gang that makes its headquarters In
the Blue River, country. .
Ben Parks, Sid Henry and George
Felshaw, all of whom have ranches in
the remote. Eagle Creek country, had
been for a long time annoyed by the
Iosb of cattle. They easily traced the
stealing to members of the Blue River
band and. set a trap to catch, them on
their next raid.
Parks saw fresh .tracks along the
Blue River trail and before' night he
had summoned Henry and ' Felshaw.
Together they laid in wait for the out
laws. In the early % evening, two men
who had just killed *a beef belonging to
Parks, stopped ' near where the three
men were in hiding, built a flre and
began to cook supper. . .
At an opportune moment Parks step
ped out and commanded them to sur
render. Instead of complying, they
made a rush for. their rifles and the
two men in the bushes opened flre,
killing. one of thenYand so dangerous
ly wounding the other that he will die..
The ranchers will hardly be prose
cuted for taking the law into their, own
hands, as .the authorities, expect the
killing -will prove a lesson to all of the
Blue River outlaws! who venture on
raids into the surrounding range coun

WASHINGTON, Nov. 28.â The offlclals
of the Naval Observatory are arranging
to send a New Year's greeting: from
Washington to all the countries of the
civilized world by the employment of a

United States, and it Is now intended to
extend the Eervice this year to cover* the

the- distant insular possessions of the
United State and all points In the " world

BERLIN, Nov. 28.â The German Au
tomobile Club decided unanimously to
night to hold the race for the James

change of speed.
The race will be run In June or July.
Elaborate arrangements for the safety
of the public and the protection of the
racers will be made. The club counts
with certainty upon obtaining* the per

course selected by the experts. There
will be many foreign competitors, ac
ceptances being already in. hand from

LOS ANGELES. Nov. 28.â The experi
ment of trying a new second baseman,
a young amateur named Head from
Santa Ana. lost Los Angeles to-day's
game and gave Seattle the first she
has won of this series. An equally po
tent reason for the result of the game
was the excellent work Hughes did in
the box. Los Angeles could do nothing
with his delivery except to make four
hits. Hughes also put up a good field
ing game, making two put-outs and
three assists.
Seattle commenced doing things to
the home team in the first inning. Lum
ley singled and* stole second. Mohler
went out on a fly to catcher. C. Smith
hit to left, scoring Lumley, and reached
second on a bad throw. Then Brashear
hit a little one which Head, the new
second baseman, let pass him and
Smith scored. In the fifth inning C.
Smith made a two-bagger and Bra
shear drove one to short, which Ray
mond missed. Smith scored. This end
er Seattle's run-getting.
The one run made by Los Angeles
was the result of two two-base hits
made in succession by J. Smith and
Dillon, respectively. At all other pe
riods of the game Los Angeles never
got a man past second base. The

PHILADELPHIA. Nov. 23.â In one of
the most tiresome and uninteresting
football games ever witnessed on
Frunklin Field, the West Point eleven
defeated Annapolis to-day, 40 to 5. Two.
miserable fumbles in rapid succession
gave the navy their only score.. As a
football game It was a dismal failure,
but as a society function It was a glo
rious success.
Seated In boxes around the field were
Secretary Root, Secretary Moody, Lieu
tenant General Young, Major General
and Airs. Chaffee. Assistant Secretary,
of the Navy Darling. Admiral Tayldr of
the Bureau of Navigation, Colonel
Mills, Superintendent of West Point;
Superintendent Brownson of the Naval
Academy, Major General Brooke, Gen
eral Miles, Major General Corbin and
Mrs. Corbin, and many other persons
prominent in army and naval circles.
The army occupied the south stand and
the navy the 'north stand. During the
intermission between the halves Sec
retary Root and General Chaffee cross
ed the field to the navy's side and were
given a warm reception by the cadets
In the center section.
Every seat In the immense grand
stand was occupied long before play
began, but the only persons who re
mained particularly interested, in the
game were the students from two
colleges. It grew so dark before the
close of the game that It was almost
Impossible to distinguish the two teams
and no effort was made to name the

Every sufferer from Catarrh dreads the coming of winter, for with the first breath of
the- frost-king this miserable disorder is fanned into life and renewed activity, and all the
disgusting symptoms come back. With every fresh cold the temperature begins to rise,
the skin becomes hot and dry, the head aches almost to the point of bursting, the eyes are
inflamed and red- the nostrils are stopped up, and the mucus discharges, at first thin and
v watery, gradually become thicker and yellow and often exceedingly offensive. The throat
and all the inner passages and cavities of the head are irritated by the acrid secretions,
resulting in loss of smell and deafness, and injury to
the soft bones of the cheek and nose, while the voice no one could have been worse.

Just the way a 2 to 1 chance should.
THE CALL'S RACING FORM CHART.
Dell Fountain's recent purchase. Col
onel Van,/ started favorite for the mile
selling affair, with a field of twelve
going to the post. The Colonel had Fer
rell on his back and, after leading for
more }han six furlongs, gave It up.
Heather Honey then looked a winner,
but Kunz could not do the filly justice.
Jimmy Booker came with a well timed
rush on Lacy Crawford at the paddock
and ln a hard drive downed Silurian
three parts of a length. The winner
was 7 to 1 in the betting.
Arabo, the big chestnut three-year
old from the Jennings' stable, was ask
ed to concede weight to Yellow Tail and
Hagerdon in the Eix and a half fur
long handicap and failed to do It. So
well was he thought of, though, that
his price remained firm throughout the
betting at 7 to 5. He raced almost un
der restraint to the stretch with Ha
gerdon, but when called upon by Mar
tin could not respond. Then, too, he
was badly bumped about a furlong
from the wire, but looked beaten at the
time. It. King, who had been avoid
ing the early pace with Yellow Tall, now
played his hand, and catching Hilder
brand on Hagerdon all ln, breezed
across the line nearly four lengths in
advance of the Cameron sprinter. Ish
tar, T.hich caused the bumping match
down the stretch, finished third.
The Jennings stable also furnished
th- favorite for the last event, the one
and a sixteenth miles handicap. Dainty,
with S8 pounds up and 8 to 5 in the
ring, received extensive support, and
In a driving finish with Albula got the
verdict by half a length. Veterano
closed strongly and would probably
have won ln a few more strides. Bragg
at no time looked dangerous.
ASK TOO MUCH OF ARABO.
Two to one was laid about Cascine,
7 to 1 Judge, and 40 the Schreiber entry.
Otto SUfel. The favorite behaved fair
ly well at the post, but Martin was
Blow to get him away when the barrier
was released, and this ruined - his
chances. Cascine seemed overburdened
with speed, and while Otto Stlfel head
ed him for half the distance, he pulled
away when straightened for the stand
and under Adkins* clever piloting won
galloping by five lengths ln the fast
time of 1:14'4,- Martin on the first choice
got in thÂ« muddy going on the rail, and
: in a fierce drive beat Otto Stifel less
than a length for the place. Judge was
never a factor, swerving badly ln the
run home.
FAVOBITES FAIL TO REPORT.
This was not the only stumbling
block speculators encountered, for four
other favorites failed to report on time.
As none of the different winners were
backed to any great extent, the book
makers retained most of the loose
chaiige.
Dainty, from the stable of Walter
Jennirgs, was the one lonely public
choice to land. The track was still
heavy and gluey for ten or twelve feet
out from the rail, which served to com
plicate things.
Bookmaker Jim Neil's Celtic monolo
grist, Mike Murphy, rang up an "eagle
.bird" for the books right at the start.
Xobody suspected it v.as in the geld
ing's makeup, but at odds of SO to 1
and ridden by Harry Birkenruth, the
outsider Jumped out in the lead and
won handily from Rinaldo, a sleeper in
the race. Snark, another unfastening,
played from 10 to 7, had to be content
with the show. A strong look-out is
'l>eiug kept for the 3 to 1 favorite, Yel
lowstone, and his arrival will be an
nounced by the tooting of the cracker
factory whistle and the tolling of the
meeting-house bell.
Â¦ ' "d." Hall did not do very well with
Father Wentker in the Futurity course

as good as left. Waterpower, a 20 to 1

lay of several weeks has been caused
by his indisposition and resulting In
ability to discuss the particulars of the
race. He designs to renew his proposals
in detailed form early in the fall of
1S04. in time* to build and try new
boats. The Emperor hopes this suspen
sion of his offer will have the approval
of the Atlantic Yacht Club and the
New York Yacht Club. He was not
unwilling that this information should
be made public, and his advisers espe
cially desire that it be clearly under
stood that "the Emperor's illness and
consequent restraints Imposed by his
physicians alone occasioned the post
ponement. , . .
LONDON, Nov. 28. â Sir Thomas Up
ton to-day received a telegram from
Lord Lonsd.ale notifying him that as
illness has prevented Emperor "William
meeting his yachting representatives
it would, be too late to build boats ln
Europe and make . the . suggested 1904
race, so the Emperor 'decided to post
pone offering his cup for a trans-Atlan
tic race until" 1905. Lord Lonsdale add
ed ' that ; the Emperor therefore would
not- take advantage of Sir Thomas Lip
ton's withdrawal. Sir Thomas replied,
agreeing with j Lord Lonsdale that it
was too late to make the proposed race
a success, and pointing out that, there
fore, it was quite useless for him to re
new his offer, the withdrawal of which
had already been. accepted. Sir Thom
as Lipton has hopes to enter a boat in
the race for the Emperor's cup in 1905.
Sir Thomas Lipton in the course of
an interview said:
"So far as Emperor William Is con
cerned, I can only say that, the Berlin
dispatch announcing the postponement
of the cup race'is quite correct. I very"
much regret the illness of such a good
sportsman* as \ the* German Emperor
and heartily look forward to entering
a boat" in his contest in 1905." '; j'
Asked If he would now renew his of
fer to the Atlantic Yacht Club, Sir
Thomas' said:* -\
."After this unfortunate. hitch and at
so late a day it would be quite impos
sible to start in again : and get up a
really good race for " 1904. I shall do
everything in my; power to make the
race for . his - Majesty's- cup in 1905 a
success, but the reasons which prompt
Emperor "William to postpone his of
fer of the cup also j make it quite im
possible for. me to -renew my offer as
regards 1904^ I withdrew, the 'offer of
my" own cup . only ', ln courtesy to . the
Emperor,, and ; In* the hope of bringing
together ' every â¢ element interested in a
transatlantic contest. Â¦ -"
"That* there will be no such race In
1904 is a great disappointment to me,
which I feel all the more keenly be
cause it ; is the Emperor's illness that
has prevented -either of "our cups be
ing raced for in that year."
BERLIN, Nov. 23.â Emperor "William
has withdrawn his offer of a cup for a
trans-Atlantic yacht race in 1904 on ac
count of his health, and has substituted
for it the offer of a cup to be raced for
in 1905. . '-
The Emperor through his representa
tive cabled his decision to theAmeri
can yachtsmen to-day, with his reason
for the postponement. These are that
the prolonged period of the Emperor's
recovery : and the consequent accumula
tion of official business have prevented
him from reaching his advisers to ar
range the details for the trans- Atlantic
race until it was-too late for the de
signers and builders to have new
yachts ready fora contest ln the spring
of 1904. ;. Â¦ â¢-Â¦;Â¦â¢ Â¦
The Associated Press is informed that
the'Emperor greatly regrets that a de-
the details is in a place of such im
portance that If he does not correctly
perform his part of the team work he
can lose or delay, the' shot or spoil It or
Injure very seriously the expensive ma
chinery, with .which you are working
when drilling with the Government's
coast cannon.- In addition to the drill
and instruction" at the '... Presidio,! a
great deal of work can" be^done here
in your armory.: A ; study ot the nom
enclature and a description of the guns
and carriages can be . carried on here
and which help you to understand more
readily when you see them in the bat
teries. In "this" connection it is neces
sary to learn to read the drawings, so
that they will present clear t ideas to
your minds."
v He then spoke'at' some length on the
necessity- of j the imen having a knowl
edge; of "cordage and' spars and the
study of; azimuth instrument, platting
board, difference chart, spanner, cor
rection table,, range scale and Â¦similar,
things ; : also a knowledge of the varl-"
oiis kinds of powder and their force.'
and "fco study projectiles,' , primers , and
fuses. 1 In closlfig .he said: ' 'Tour bat
talion'commander,: Colonel Bush,, has
so successfully directed hls_ efforts;for
the advancement of- the â¢ organization,
giving, without- stirit^hlsltline and: per;-,

co-operation of the . officers of the bat- i

A. Paul O'Brien as colonel, vice. Dr.
McCarthy, resigned, and he has been
assigned to duty on the staff of the
major general as chief surgeon of divi
sion.
The lecture by Lieutenant G. S. Gar
ber," Artillery Corps, U. S. A., before
the First Battalion of Artillery in the
Ellis-street armory last Monday night
was a very interesting- and Instructive
one for the officers and. men of that or
ganization, lie said that a national
reserve corps of trained artillerists
with which to supplement, the regular
coast artillery in cases .. of stirring
times is an imperative need, which -the
Government has recognized in making
provision for the instruction. and train
ing of such organizations of the Na
tional Guard as he was' addressing.
/The central thing In coast artillery,, he
"said, is the service of the piece â learn
ing to shoot the guns, and that all work
done by the members of the. battalion
is to the simple end â preparation for
battle, when there is but one object,
and that is to shoot the guns as rap
idly and accurately as possible until
there is no need .to shoot them any
longer. The drill, he said, is most im
portant, as it is constantly*changlng,
i which changes affect- minor particulars
and; details of the different operations
and often modify the j general ] system.
These, he held, are indications of the
evolution that lsTgoIng on In the artil
lery service.. The officers of the artil
lery, ordnance,! engineer and signal
corps are continually trying new meth
ods, new devices, new implements, em
placements, position finding "systems
and instruments, .communications and
so forth in the endeavor to. bring the
system to the highest possible develop
ment of efficiency, arid each day* the of
ficers of -the; coast artillery analyze
their methods in' the effort to constant
ly improve it and secure the greatest
rapidity and accuracy attainable.
He then entered into a detailed ac
count of the manner; in which the of
ficers observe the actions of the men
at that piece arid figure out how by fix
ing the. duty of. each man a s second* or
two may be saved without interfering
with the accuracy and the result sought
to-be obtained. ,-: :;-'Â«' : Â« . .
The artillery, officers, he said, are de
serving of credit^ not only in develop
ing the drill, but for devising many of
the instruments: with. which they work
and. they have a large share in the de
velopment of 'the cannon and carriage,
of the powder and projectiles and in
the construction and fitting- of em
placements. The - artillery and
nance officers 'are working hand In
hand toward the higher development
and greater i . effectiveness of .our guns
and projectiles, he said.' The object of
the , artillery, and ordnance . is to keep
the penetrating , and destructive power
of projectiles ahead of the effectiveness
of armor plate In .. resisting them.
* SPECIALIZATION
I In relation to the instruction mapped
out for the First. Battalion of Artillery
he said: 'V 1 believe It- is : the intention
after the holidays- for you to- again
take up your instruction at the [ Pre
sidio. In drilling there. for your battal
ion V to I be brought to- the j greatest ef -,
ficiency inithe shortest time, especially
considering the "many i other interests
that all of you have, It Is necessary! to
resort Â¦ to specialization. It is . not only
unnecessary ] but '. undesirable , that each
of/you should = learn' all the operations
that together, make up the drill. Your
officers .will assign .to each of you "some
particular operation, and 'as far as pos
sible you should ~ t do i the samej work
each time'you visit the guns. } That will
not be hard ~ as any ,'one of them . taken
by, Itself is 'simple and , you will be care

as follows: "Of all combinations of mis
information the guard J has to contend
with this, the 'red book,' is unques
tionably the worst. It is a complete
compendium, of military inaccuracy
supplemented by a mass of obsolete
and useless precautions; formulated by
successive adjutant generals, and add
ed to what there was before 'they came
into office. On every seven out of ten
pages there are rules prescribed for
guidance which are diametrically, op
posed to the regulations of ; the, army,
which should be the. rule of ; conduct
as far as practicable. Men who - are
anxious to know what the . laws" are

rules and regulations are prescribed,
are continually led astray by the
perusal of this volume." -

TACOAIA, Nov. 2S.â Government ex
perts and the Pacific Northwest rail
roads are making & second effort to
size ud the grain crop of the present
year in Washington and Idaho. The es
timates made heretofore have varied
from 12.000,000 to 22,000,000 bushels. The
higher figures comprise the Government
estimate, and in a bulletin issued by
the Agricultural Department it iras
shown that this year the yield showed
an Increase over last year.
Crop experts declare these figures to
be wildly exaggerated. Instead of
showing an increase the wheat yield,
they say, actually fell off between 25
and 50 per cent. The estimates of grain
buyers vary from 12,000,000 to 18,000.000
bushels. The crop probably runs about
14,000,000 bushels.
Expert Stephen J. Fessenden of Wash
ington Is now ln the grain districts to
secure accurate knowledge regarding
the situation. The Northern Pacific
Railway has instructed Its representa
tives throughout the grain belt to make
accurate reports at once, based on the
wheat shipped to the seaboard and the
grain now in warehouses. High prices
alone have saved the grain producers
from a loss of this year's crop.
Better that babes should weep than
bearded men.

This is the second injunction issued
by Judge Seawell in connection with
this case. When the suit first came up
for trial he enjoined the officers of the
municipality from destroying the propr
erty of the company from the Town
send street depot to Seventeenth street,
because It was shown that the company
had a franchise to* run its lines up to
Seventeenth street. When this injunc
tion was jj Issued the company was
granted permission to file an amended
complaint, and when the case again
came up it was on the question of the
company's right to maintain its line
from Seventeenth to Twenty-second
street, an amendment to the original
complaint, based on the claim of the
company that rights of way over this
section had been granted by affirmative
acts of the board.
The opinion rendered by Judge Sea
well yesterday was on thl3 point, and
his decision estops the authorities from
tearing up any of the tracks from
Townsend street to the county line un
til after the trial of the cause. Judge
Seawell's opinion in part is as follows:
"Assuming that the allegations to the
amendment of the complaint are true,
it would be manifestly inequitable on
the part of the municipal authorities
under the existing conditions, to imme
diately destroy the continuity of plain
tiff's road by removing the tracks at
the crossings of the streets between
Sixteenth and Twenty-second streets.
Upon the faith of a license on the part
of the municipal authorities plaintiff
has expended thousands of dollars in
acquiring and constructing terminal
facilities on Townsend street; Jt has
The Board. ,of Supervisors has been
enjoined from tearing up the tracks of
the Southern Pacific Company running
from Seventeenth to Twenty-second
streets. The injunction was issued yes
terday by Judge Seawell, who In an
opinion handed down with the decision
holds that tho company is entitled to
an Injunction pending the trial of the
suit for^ a permanent restraining order,
because it has shown that the removal
of the tracks at this, time would be
manifestly inequitable and result In Ir
reparable Injury to the plaintiff by ob
structing the continuity of its lines.
For years, in the opinion of Judge Sea
well, the company has been led by af
firmative acts of various Boards of Su
pervisors to the expenditure of large
sums of money in maintaining these
connecting lines between the Townsend
street depot and the San Mateo County
branch, the failure of * the different
Boards of Supervisors to object to the
use of the disputed streets being prac
tically; in the opinion of the court, a
granting of permission, to .maintain the
lines It is now sought to remove. Judge
Seawell cites in support of this portion
of his opinion the fact that the passage
by the Board of Supervisors In 1896 of
an ordinance giving to the com
pany the right to erect in the dis
puted territory a number of bells and
other signals was an affirmative act,
one of maqy tending to show that the
maintenance of the tracks was not ob
jectionable.

"As the injunction to be granted will
be operative only until the final hear
ing of the cause,' it Is unnecessary at
present to determine the extent of the
plaintiff's equities') or ' the" length' of
time during which it will be lawful for
plaintiff "to maintain its tracks , across
the streets; in controversy. All that I
will now decide Is 'that the injunction
should operate until the trial of the
cause.
!'I am disposed to hold, however, that
the State gave to the San /, Francisco
and San Jose Railroad Company . not
the right to occupy or use" the streets'
of the city for ? railroad- purposes,: but
merely', the 'capacity to receive and en
joy that right in case this city through
a two-thirds vote of its Board' of 'Suf
pervlsors saw" fit to grant it.-' In the
act â¢ of 1861 Â¦ the city is ; empowered 4 to
give/* grant or donate.' To the same
effect is section 470 'of the. Civil Code,
which provides that \ 'no j railroad ' cor;
poration must use any!- street within
any Incorporated city or town unless
TEMPOBABY INJUNCTION.
"It is not claimed by the defendant's
counsel that plaintiff's tracks across
the streets are a nuisance in the sense
that they are Injurious to health or of
fensive to the senses or interfere with
the comfortable enjoyment of life or
property. The "right of plaintiff to the
relief sought is resisted solely upon the
ground that there has been no grant
to it by the Board of Supervisors of
the right to lay its tracks across the
streets between Sixteenth and Twenty
second streets. The ordinance com
piained of does not prohibit the use of
steam as a motive power on plaintiff's
road, but merely requires the removal
of "the tracks and rails south of the
northerly line of Sixteenth street. K
it is merely the use of steam as a mo
tive power in a populous section of the
city which - constitutes the alleged
nuisance, the power to abate it does
not necessarily extend to the destruc
tion of the tra'cks and rails, which are
susceptible of use for a lawful purp6se.
The unlawful use may be prevented
without destroying the property.
"Even if the Board of Supervisors
had granted to the San. Francisco and'
San Jose Railroad Company In the
most unqualified. terms the right to use
the streets in question, the board would
not thereby have divested Itself of its
police power in relation to public
health, comfort and safety." That
power is a governmental function, and
neither the State Legislature nor any
inferior legislative body- to which such
power has been granted can alienate or
abridge the right to exercise it by any
grant, contract or delegation whatever.
"I see no reason why an estep:.nl
against the public should not have all
the elements required in the case of pri
vate persons. It would be much more
reasonable, in my opinion, to hold that
a valid title could be obtained by pre
scription again the. public in these
cases where a grant from the public
authorities was legally possible. The
Board of Supervisors had authority to
grant the plaintiff's grantor the use of
the streets in controversy, and if the
question were an open one in this State
I should have no difficulty in holding
that plaintiff by its continuous use of
the streets for more than thirty years
had acquired a" "right of which it could
not be deprived =by an ordinance of the
Board of Supervisors. But the fact
that plaintiff has not acquired a title
by prescription 'is not, in my opinion, a
sufficient reason- for inventing a new
rule of estoppel to remedy a supposed
injustice caused by a refusal to recog
nize or apply the doctrine of prescrip
tion.
"In granting:the injunction pendente
lite I place my decision upon' the
ground that the plaintiff has been in
duced by affirmative acts on the part,
of the Board of Supervisors to make
extensive Improvements and extend its I
business, and that these improvements
would be rendered of no value and that
business irreparably injured by the im
mediate destruction of the continuity
of its line of road between its ter
minus on Townsend street and the
southern boundary of the city and
courtty. * ' â¢

Judge Mogan allowed her sixty days'
board and lodging at the city and coun

appreciative. She did not like to be
drawn away from public gaze. She
misses the glare of the electric lights,
the toot toot of the "buzz wagon" and
the clang of the trolley.
"My, gracious, Judge, this Is awful,"
she gurgled. "Can't you make It thirty
days and I'll hie me to some other berg."
Judge Mogan refused to be moved by
the soulful looks of Louisa. Her piteous
appeal proved a â¢ "frost" and she was
taken away to repent of the folly of
wearing suspenders.
The fair one actually had the consum
mate nerve to court a school marm and
went so far as to propose marriage.
Louisa was not moved by love; she sim
ply needed the money and thought a pro
posal was the best way to get the coin.
Her unladylike conduct brought her
within the meshes of the law. The duped
school teacher refused to prosecute.
Louisa came closer to being the "new

man. Harsh words never grated on her
ear. and she smoked because it was the
real thing. '
Louisa Matson will enjoy seclusion ln
the County Jail for sixty days. Louisa
is opposed to hiding herself from public
gaze, as she prides herself on her ability
to wear trousers and a necktie with as
much grace as any well-dressed youth of

the proper crease and are turned up like

"The ordinance upon which plaintiff
chiefly rely as evidence of consent on
the part of the t city Is entitled 'Order
No. 3043, regulating the rate of speed
of trains upon Southern Pacific Rail
road,' and was evidently intended not
as a grant to the plaintiff of- the right
to lay or maintain Its tracks between
the termini therein" mentioned, but
merely as the title indicates 'to regu
late the speed of trains. It does not
purport to grant that right to plain
tiff, but assumes that it has already
been acquired. It is, however, clearly
an expression of consent on the part of
the city while the ordinance remains in
force to the use by plaintiff of its road
as at present constructed and operated
from Its terminus on Townsend street
ta the, southern boundary of the city
arid county. .
the right to so, use the same Is granted
by. a two-thirda vote of the town or
city, authority from which the right
must emanate.'
"If mere consent on the part of the
municipality to the presence of plain
tiff's tracks upon the street crossings
in Question for any period of time,
however short, were sufficient to Invest
in the plaintiff the right to maintain
them during the entire life of the cor

He left San Quentin on November 3

the evening of the 5th inst.
Last night he tore his bedding into

hang himself. Just as he was about
to complete his design his prepara

prisoner, who threatened to give an
alarm If he proceeded with his prepar

Mayor Warren Olney has returned
from his northern trip, having been gone
but nine days, and he is once more tak
ing his usual active Interest in the af
fairs of the city. Most of his time in
the north was spent attending to private
business, but he found opportunity while
away to do much work that will.be of
benefit to Oakland,.
The Mayor had little to say of his trip
north, as the results of his observations
have been published In the letter sent by
him to the press of this city. There was
little to add to the letter, he said.
"A summary of my observations," said
the Mayor, "is that wooden stave pipe is
more serviceable for large water mains
than steel. There is practically no wear
to it. while the life of steel pipe is short
In some kinds of soil.
"In the cities of the north there is a
civic pride and a public spirit that it
does one good to see. Oakland Is awak
ening in this direction and it can with
benefit to itself develop this spirit.
"Oakland has the advantage of the
north In the matter of climate. While I
was away I only saw the sun a few
times. When I looked out of the car
window on the trip down and saw the
stars shining. I knew that we had
crossed the Siskiyou Mountains and were
once more in California."
The Mayor will fit once resume his
work upon the forthcoming bond issue.

In the afternoon an old-time minstrel
show and farce were given at Shattuck
Hall. Sidney Peixotto acted as inter
locutor and made his friends In black
faces and outlandish clothes do all the
funny things he could think of. The
tambourine endmen were John Lavell,
George Hammer and Charles Norton
and the bones endmen were Abe Apple
ton, Eugene Richards and Harry
O'Day. The endmen provided all sorts
of fun and kept the audience in a roar
most of the time. The other entertain
ers were Joseph McKeon and William
Prangs. Ed Penaluna and Bert Talcott.
The farce. "Mush." followed the min
strel show and the same boys took
part In it, with the addition of Joseph
Moriarity.
After a band concert on the street
this evening by the Columbia Park
Boys' Band a vaudeville performance
was given in the same hall. The prin
cipal feature at this entertainment was
the singing of the chorus of forty
voices under Major Peixotto, with Fred

performers were Walter Roesner, cor
netist; Herman Stein, Louis Stein, Hy

"Boys, I want to compliment you all
on your military appearance and drill
ing. I want particularly to com
pliment Columbia Drum Corps. You
know the manual of arms and
how to march and I think your officers
must know their business. This is a
good work the companies are doing, be
cause it teaches obedience and disci
pline and at the same time gives the
boys amusement. When you grow up
you will find that you have learned
more than you think, and I would ad
vise you always to be as soldierly and
patient as you can."
Major Peixotto, replying In a brief
address, said that the Columbia Park
boys were delighted with their Berke
ley visit and hoped the friendships
formed during the day would be
cemented Into more lasting ones in the
future.
At the noon hour the Columbia boys
were the guests at the homes of the
Junior Cadets, each of whom enter
tained as many boys as his mother
could accommodate. The same plan
was carried out during the dinner hour
this evening.
After that. Company A of the Junior
Cadets drilled, and though they have
only been practicing two months, the
boys stepped around In perfect unison.
The boys were then addressed by Pro
fessor Walter Magee, physical instruc-*
tor of the University of California, who
said:
The Columbia Park boys' battalion
was met at Berkeley station at 10
o'clock this morning by the Junior Ca
dets and escorted to Harmon Gymna
sium In the university grounds. The
Junior Cadets, In kahki uniforms with
blue trimmines, led the way under
command vf Captain M. R. Van Wor
mer. The Columbia Park boys, mar
tialed by Major Sidney Peixotto, showed
off well in blue uniforms with light blue
trimmings. The two comrrfands
marched in perfect order and were ap
plauded all alons the route. The Co
lumbia Drum Corps and the Columbia
Bugle Corps made the air ring with the
martial beat and call, which made
everybody think a whole army had
come to capture Berkeley.
The Columbia Park boys gave an ex
hibition drill in the gymnasium just to
show what they can do under arms.
The whole command, 130 in all. marched
around and wheeled around and per
formed the most difficult evolutions
with the greatest ease, with hardly any
word from Major Peixotto. They
marched in twos and fours and eights
and swept around in long lines without
making a break, every new formation
getting a cheer from the spectators.
COMPANY A DBILLS.
BERKELEY. Nov. 28.â The Columbia
Park Boys' Club of San Francisco spent
to-day in Berkeley as the guest of the
Berkeley Junior Cadets. There was a
variety of entertainment for every hour
of the day and hardly a dull moment
until the little sleepy heads went home
to-night to dream ot nice things to eat
and the funny end man in the minstrel
show.
City Trustee W. M. Bowers said:
"Thus far no definite plan of action
with respect to the rejected franchises
has been outlined by the City Trustees.
We passed the ordinances awarding the
franchises, but they were not adver
tised. This method was pursued by the
City Clerk at my suggestion, as it
would have been loss of money to pay
for advertising franchises until we
knew they were accepted. What action
will now be taken with the ordinances
passed will depend on the advice of the
City Attorney." -Â¦Â»,.;
ALAMEDA. Nov. 28.â Now that Gen
eral Manager Julius Kruttschnitt, rep
resenting the Southern and Central Pa
ciflc railway companies, has refused to
accept the two local franchises as
awarded to those corporations by the
City Trustees, the latter are not falling
over themselves in a hasty effort tct
make the management another propo
sition. On the contrary, some of the
municipal legislators feel that they
have been treated in an undignified
and shabby manner by the railroad
powers after laboring hard for five
months to deal fairly by the companies
in the face of strong opposition from
citizens who believed that the Southern
Pacific and Central Pacific were de
manding too many privileges from the
people of Alameda. It is not unlikely
thatfthe City Trustees will allow the
matter of the franchises to remain as it
Is for some time. They do not believe
that it would do any harm, and a ces
sation of the agitation may serve to
clear the 'Situation, so" that when fur
ther action is decided upon more satis
factory results may be obtained. In
speaking of the refusal of Manager
Kruttschnitt to accept the franchises
as granted President Joseph F. For
derer of the City Trustees said:
"I have not read Mr. Kruttschnltt's
letter very carefully, or in full, and
therefore ' do not know just what he
wants or expects. I have been in Los
Angeles for three weeks and am some
what out i2 touch with the matter of
the franchises, but was not greatly sur
prised to learn that they had been re
fused. I have not given the situation
much thought as yet and have no plans
for disposing of the question when it
comes up again. I have not conferred
with any other of the City Trustees,
and do not know how they feel about
the matter."
City Trustee Charles J. Hammond
said: "I think the railroad managers
may have future cause to regret that
they refused the franchises as we of
fered them. We had reasons to believe
that the franchises would be accepted
on the twenty-five-year basis. It Is dis
appointing to some of us to feel that
after struggling with the franchise
matter for five months. endeav
oring to treat the railroad companies
justly and contending with strong op
position from residents, our work
should count for naught. I, for one. am
willing to let the question of the dis
posal of the franchises rest for a time.
I do not think the city will suffer
through delay, and the management of
the railroad companies may think bet
ter of the terms we offered."
If the project justifies the hopes of
the university the theater will corre
spond to the world-famous "La Come
dle Francalse" and "L'Odeon" of Paris,
the national theaters of France, both
of which have a wide influence in the
education of the French people.
The nucleus for the proposed fund is
to be gained from a concert that Is to
be given by the Royal Italian Band in
the Greek theater on December 9, for
which an excellent programme has been
arranged. In case of rain, however, the
concert will be given in the Harmon
Gymnasium.
The "National Theater," that thing
so often talked about but always
thought of as something for the dim
future, is in a fair way to be estab
lished at the University of California.
The West, that probably all those who
talked about this airy castle never
di^amed of as entitled, to the distinc
tion, is to have the "National Theater."
The project was suggested to Presi
dent Wheeler and the members of the
faculty by Ben Greet, manager -of , the
company of English players that played
"Twelfth Night" in the new Greek
open-air theater. Mr. Greet spoke of
a national theater one day at a univer
sity meeting, but he, like many othe'rs
who had gone before him, did not have
California in mind when he spoke of it.
Mr. Greet's remarks gave the cue to
one of the faculty, however, and from
an Idea grew the first tangible effort to
ward securing the theater. President
Wheeler was made a party to the plan,
and out of a conference came a com
mittee with well-deflned powers for for
mulating still more substantial plans
for the project. This committee is com
posed of men who contributed so large
ly to the success of the recent dramatic
festival which signalized the dedica
tion of the Greek theater, its members
being Professor William D. Armes,
Lincoln Hutchinson and J. B. Lanfleld.
Now this committee Is first' charged
with securing a fund for the "National
Theater," for, of course, such a thing
could not be conducted without money.
To secure the fund the committee will
Invite dramatic companies playing In
the West to come to the university and
present their plays in the Greek thea
ter, the proceeds of which performances
will be stored up for future use. In
the course of a few years such a fund
will be accumulated in this way as will
permit the university to invite the his
trionic talent of the world to its "Na
tional Theater." It Is Intended that
only the very best talent will be In
vited to perform and the committee of
direction will have entire charge. Man
agers of theatrical troops, it is expect
ed, will be glad of the opportunity to
bring their companies here, becahse of
the advertisement and the prestige of
the university.
The large fund that will be created
within the next few years will permit
the university not only to import talent

PREACHER'S WIFE
GIVEN A DIVORCE
For paying, attentions to his wife,
whom he alleges to be insane, Thomas
Wand of Fruitvale yesterday jammed
the face of Robert Cords Jr. into a rock
pile until it looked like a hammered
beefsteak. Wand says ta will now be
forced to have his wife brought before
the insanity commission and examined
as to her mental balance. Cords says
he only acted the part of a friend to
Mrs. Wand and protected her from the
brutality of her husband.
The matter came up in Justice of the
Peace Geary's court this afternoon,
where both men were cited to appear
on a charge of disturbing the peace.
Wand also had an additional charge of
battery lodged against him by Cords.
He pleaded guilty to both offenses and
the matter of sentence was taken un
der advisement by the Judge. Cords
pleaded not guilty and has demanded a
trial.
Cords is the young real estate agent
who recently figured in a sensational
midnight marriage with a' reputed heir
ess at a well known restaurant in this
city. Each believed the other to be
well provided with : this world's goods
and the awakening came with the
morning, when they discovered that
neither had a cent. He is charged by
Wand with taking Mrs. Wand to va
rious resorts while she was in an un
balanced state of mind. Yesterday the
two men met at East Fourteenth street
and Fruitvale avenue, where the en
counter took place.

affairs have been planned for next
week, the most Important, perhaps, be
ing the assembly next Friday night at
Reed Hall. , Elaborate preparations are
being made, new gowns are being
fashioned for the occasion and the sup

the Ebell room, promises to be a verit
able feast. The "prom" in Berkeley
takes place the same night, but a num
ber of the college boys have agreed to
attend the assembly also, although at
a late hour.
The patronesses are taking an unus
ual interest in the assembly this year
and consequently the young people are
anticipating the "time of their lives"
next Friday night. The patronesses
are Mrs. W. H. Chickering, Mrs. Q. A.
Chase, Mrs. T. C. Coogan, Mrs. W. S.
Goodfellow, Mrs. H. W. Kates, Mrs.

Charles J. Mackintosh, engineer of the
new ferry steamer Jan Jose. "who is the
defendant In a suit for divorce brought
by Marguerite Mackintosh, his talented
&nd handsome young wife, whom he
wooed and won while she was a passen
ger on the vessel plying between this
port and Seattle on which he was engi
neer, will not allow the ties uniting them
to be severed without a struggle. Yes
terday he filed an answer to her com
plaint, denying that he ever treated her
cruelly. In a cross-complaint he charges
her with being the cause of the rift in
their matrimonial happiness.
Mackintosh says he is a much-abused
Individual, a martyr to a young woman's
ungovernable temper and a prey. to the
ldiocyncradcs of a wife he had treated
with all the deference and respect and
love due from a loving and faithful and
affectionate husband. He charges that
his wife, without his consent, left the
home at 635 Golden Gate avenue he had
provided for her upon tbeir arrival in
this city after their hasty marriage at
Seattle. She -went to live, he says, with
her mother nt 1748 Larkln street, and he,
much against- his will, was compelled to
take up his residence under the same
roof with his mother-in-law. He says
his life there was a very unhappy one
and ended only when his mother-in-law
and young wife ordered him out last Oc
tober. t 'Y,r"
Mackintosh alleges further, in support
of his charge, that Mrs. Mackintosh has
never treated him with the respect he
feels is his due. that she squandered his
earnings and" is extravagant to a degree.
He says that sho has not only injudi
ciously expended his salary of 1150 a
month, but has pawned numerous keep
sakes that he held In great regard and
would not have parted with under any
circumstances. She has also pawned his
library, he says, and to add to his humil
iation, has borrowed money from people
with whom she had but a slight ac
quaintance. Her crowning act of cruelty,
avers Mackintosh, was her statement
that she no longer loved him; that she
hated hlni. ~ Â¦â¢ . â¢; ;

Lydia E, Pinkham's Vegetable Compound*
" Deaii llns. PnrKHAM : â There are but few drives and mothers "who
hare not at times endured agonies and such pain as only women know.
I wish cuch women knew the value of Lydia E. Pinlchain's Vegetable
Compound. It is a remarkable medicine, different in action from any
I ever knew and thoroughly reliable.
" I have seen cases where women doctored for years without perma-
nent benefit, who were cured in less than three months after taking your
Vegetable Compound, while others who were chronic and incurable
came out cured, happy, and in perfect health after a thorough treatment
with this medicine. I have never used it myself without gaining great
benefit. A few doses restores my strength and appetite, and tones up
the entire system. Your medicine has been tried and found true, hence
I ful]y endorse it." â Mbs. R. A. Axdeeson, 225 "Washington St., Jack-
sonville, Fla.
Mrs. Reed, 2425 E. Cumberland St., Philadelphia, Pa., says :
"Dear Mrs. PixoiAii: â I feel it my duty

and true remedy. Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound at once
removes such troubles.
The experience and testimony of some of the most noted
women of America go to prove, beyond a question, that Lydia E.
Pinkhara's Vegetable Compound, will correct all such trouble at
once by removing- the cause and restoring: the organs to a healthy
and normal condition. If in doubt, -write Mrs. Pinkham at Lynn,
Mass, as thousands do. Her advice is free and helpful.
No other medicine for women in the world has received such wide-
spread and unqualified endorsement. No other medicine has such a
record of cures of female troubles. Refuse to buy any substitute.

GOSSIP OF P.LAYS
AND OF ACTORS
The Dally Telegraphâ From the
cloud of impressions arising out of
a first night at the theater some
chief memory generally emerges. A
scene, a situation, a character, a mel
ody, an Individual performance â any of
these It may be that makes dim the rest
and holds the center of . our recollec
tions. It is safe to say that Saturday's
audience came away from their Intro
duction to "The Duchess of Dantzic"
with one eclipsing memory in their
minds â the figure of the tyrannical lit
tle Corsican holding court in the
splendor of the Tuileries. It was a
strange thing and one that establishes
a record. .Hitherto In the mus.ic play,
whatever Its slyle and description, the
character that speaks has played a very
medest second fiddle to the charactor
that sings. On Saturday, however, one
saw the singers out-paced by an actor,
the first Napoleon, with never a musical,
note to utter, towering over his tuneful
comrades. That admirable and clear
cut piece of acting wa.j the night's most
magnetic" feature, and Mr. Holbrook
Blinn, fortunate in his opportunity,
walked away, with the laurel .wreaths.
Incidentally the brilliancy of " Mr.
Blinn's portrait of Napoleon Is worthy
to be noted. Undoubtedly the opportuni
ty is a" good one, and the 'part written
In the same production Jn which
Denis (TSullivan has Just made such
a delightful 6tir in London, "The Duch
ess of Dantzlc,". another Californian,
Holbrook Blinn, Is sharing equal hon
ors. I noted the fact some Sundays
ago, printing a few of the comments
on Mr. O'Sulllvan's part of the per
formance. There are now to hand some
criticisms of Mr. Blinn's work, that
are no less pleasing to the local patriot.
The young actor, by the way, was a
Stanford student, and a graduate of
the local Boys' High School. For the
last six years Mr. Blinn has been in
London, gaining a steadily larger
share of public favor. In "The Duchess
of Dantzic," the new romantic opera
by Henry Hamilton and Ivan Caryll,
Mr. Blinn as Napoleon seems to have
made the hit of his career so far. The
opera is a setting of the "Sans Gene"
play of Sardou, and It 'will readily be
imagined that the Napoleonic role is
one prolific of opportunities. Mr. Blinn
seems to have availed himself of them
all, from the following flattering com
ments:
George Ade is in New York and will
remain until his new comedy, "The
County Chairman," which has been
very successful In Chicago, is produced
at Wallack's Theater. New Yorkers
will have their first opportunity
Thanksgiving week to judge Mr. Ade as
a writer of straight comedy. In "The
County Chairman" types of the Middle
Western village are introduced into a
wholeabrae love . story. There are
strongly dramatic ' moments, but the
witty lines and funny situations in
"The County Chairman" give it the
true George Ade stamp.
The life of Edgar Allan Poe has been
dramatized by George C. Hazelton,
author of "Mistress Nell," and the play,
called "The Raven," is to be produced
at once by Maurice Campbell with
Frederick Lewis as the star. It will
b e presented in New York as one of the
holiday offerings. ,
"Sky Farm." which Joseph R. Gris
mer has on the road this season, is
notable for the beauty of its stage pic
tures. One scene, depicting an apple
orchard In autumn, is declared to be
the most beautiful setting shown in
any theater this season.
Joseph. Hart and Carrie de Mar are to
remain under the: xianagement of Wil
liam A. Brady, even after o they cease
to appear In "Foxy Grandpa." This
farce has been on the road two years
and is said to have earned $50,000.
â¢ * â¢
Aubrey Bouclcault is meeting with
considerable success in his performance
of "Captain Charlie." The play is soon
to begin an extended engagement in
New York.
Miss MarieÂ°Tempest. who will follow
Miss Ethel Barrymore at the Hudson
Theater in "The Marriage 1 of Kitty," on
November 30. will sail for America* on
November 18 in company with her
husband, Cosmo- Gordon Lennox; Ar
thur Bertram, her acting manager; W.
La Trove, her stage manager, and
Gilbert Hare, one of the leading mem
bers of her company. Leonard Boyne,
Mies Tempest's chief supporting player,
and the other members of the organiza
tion will follow at a later date. Julian
Magnus is acting as business manager
for Miss TempesL

In which Robert Edeson will be pre
sented on January 18.
Meantime the young womanâ she Is
just 21â has appeared with much suc
cess at the Manhattan Theater, in the
Anna Wilson, a graduate of the
Tivoli and wife of "Jack" Wilson, so
long connected with it, is now being
heard from. Miss Wilson went to new
York a few months ago and seems al
ready to have obtained a' very satis
factory footing there. She will be re
membered here as Siebel ("Eaust"),
Frederick ("Mignon"), Pepe ("I'Pag
llaccl") and in other important minor
roles. Miss W-ilson has sung for Henry
Savage, with the result that the man
ager is considering her for a part in a
new production. Whitney also made
the young Californian an offer of the
best part he had open, but assured her
that the role was not worthy of her.
Harris, however, has retained Miss
Wilson for-. a part in anew English
comedy opera. In which she may or
may not appear, but for the study of
which she is in receipt of a substantial
cash retainer. Â«

The Morning Postâ The Napoleon of
Holbrook Blinn was a remarkable per
formance. He was the central figure
on the stage; all eyes were on him and
criticism would have been only "too
ready to* pounce on anything he did
which might appear unworthy of the
historic figure he represented. It Is
no little credit to the actor, therefore,
to be able to say that he was always
dignified and impressive and gave us
a picture of Napoleon which could not
be equaled.
The Sun â Now "Sans Gene" without
Napoleon would be as impossible as
"Hamlet" without the Prince of Den
mark. The greatest difficulty of all is
to make Napoleon impressive in such
a milieu, and it would be difficult to
praise too highly the manner In which
Holbrook Blinn comes out of the ordeal.
With all respect to Martin Harvey and
Sir Henry Irving, Mr. Blinn makes a
more satisfactory Napoleon than either
of themâ in spite of the fact that he
is more or less out of the picture all
the time.

Chief interest at the initial matinee
yesterday of the Homer Lind Lieder
spiel Company at the Manhattan The
ater centered in the first production in
America of a one-act operetta by Men
delssohn called in English "Return of
the Roamer." Musically, It was an am
bitious effort for Mr. Lind and his con
freres, but all concerned acquitted
themselves to the satisfaction of a
friendly though critical audience..
This little opera, light In vein, but
making requisitions on the highest or
der of vocal art, was written by the
great composer seventy-five years ago,
and privately produced on the occasion
of the silver wedding anniversary of his
parents. It was never published or
publicly performed during Mendels
sohn's lifetime, but "The Peddler's
Song" and one or more of the trios have
since becorBe favorites on the concert
platform.
Its conventional story, wearisome
witicisms and unsingable lyrics, as ren
dered into English by H. J. Chorley
and Willard Holcomb, are 'scarcely
suitable to the modern stage, and It is
only as a peg on which to hang the
music that the play can properly be
considered. Greater proficiency in act
ing and stage management might have
Improved the general effect, but
throughout the programme it was evi
dent that, with one notable exception,
Mr. Llnd had succeeded in obtaining

Peter Grogan, who died at Baltimore
this week, Is said to have been the in
ventor 6t the "installment plan." He
began selling furniture In Baltimore
and Â¦Washington thirty-five or forty
years ago onNregularly deferred pay
ments. His scheme was a good one,
and was almost Instantly taken up all
over this country, spreading hence to
Kurope. Such, at any rate, is the claim
of the local biographer.
The opportunity to furnish a room or
a house decently on credit has been a
blessing to thousands. It does not vio
late the good old rule, "Pay as you go
lf you can't pay don't go." The man
who pays on Installments is paying as
he goes. He simply enjoys the use of
the goods before the title to them is
vested in him. This Is not an act of
grace on the part of the sellerâ It is
good business policy, because It en
ables him to sell more goods than he
otherwise would.
The installment system tends to mar
riage, to home-making, to the raising
of families, to domestic thrift. Our
lares and penatea are still mighty gods,
and the installment payments are in
cense burned at their shrine. If Peter
Grogan really did invent the system,
he deserves a monument.â New York

operation the rate of exchange must fall
low enough to offer a profit by the time
of the maturity of the bills which will
contrast favorably with the rate of in
terest in the local market. A rise in
the call money rate consequently de

easing of the call loan rate Induces new

There is some question raised whether
the currency reflux from the West may
be delayed by the desire of Western
bankers to protect themselves against
money emergencies. Butit is not likely
that anything short of actual runs on
banks would prevent the usual remit

lowing national banks to count deposits
in reserve cities as part of their own re
serve. Hopes over the railroad outlook
are inclined to turn the chances f or re

eration by economies growing, out of
the large permanent betterments ef
fected during the late prosperous

NEW YORK, Nov. 28.â There was
nothing representative of influential
financial sentiment in to-day's dull stock
market, the dealings being confined to
small operations by room traders. The
minor industrials were relieved of the
severe pressure to which they have
been recently subjected and were in
clined to rebound, gains of a point or
upward being the result In a number
of cases. The general list failed to re
spond to this influence and there was
a disposition to sell following the ap
pearance of the bank statement,
which was favorable. The market
closed firm at a recovery and not", far
from last night's level in any csae. The
gain in cash by the banks was only
about half what was estimated, but the
decline in deposit liabilities was effect
ed by the loan contraction of 56.394.600.
The resulting decrease of $1,445,350 In
the reserve requirement helped out the
surplus to that extent, bringing the
increase in that item to $2,123,SE0. Ad
ditional gold was received by to-day's
incoming steamships, and reports from
London Indicate a prospect that part of
53,000,000 to arrive there next week will
be engaged in New York. The weekly
bank clearings indicate that the shrink
age from last year's level is still con
fined to the four large speculative cen
ters, while the three largest cities in
the West and South and the other cit
ies of the whole country continue to
show clearings in excess of last year.
The tone of the weekly report of the
mercantile agencies was considered en
couraging as to the agricultural dis
tricts and the mercantile and distribu
tive lines, although the manufacturing
and industrial branches are in a mood
of discouragement.
INDUSTRIAL STOCKS ASSAILED.
The week's stock martfet has been
chiefly remarkable for a series of sav
age onslaughts upon various industrial
stocks of minor corporations. The rail
road list and the industrial stocks,
which have already gone through a
drastic process of contraction, stood
comparatively firm in face of this at
tack, and even made some slight head
way against the current. But the vio
lent declines going on in the minor in
dustrials effectually discourage any
great activity for a rise, and this,
coupled with the interruption of the
Thanksgiving holiday, resulted in a
rather dull and uninteresting market
outside of the special movements re
ferred to.
The successive breaks in industrial
stocks were evidently the result of a
systematic weedlng-out process, pri
marily on the part of the banks and
money lenders in rsepect to collateral
loans, but to an important extent by a
party of professional fcraders who
seemed to have knowledge of the inten
tion of those throwing the stocks out
of collateral and who resorted to fierce
raiding tactics on the Stock Exchange.
Given a security, that Is still largely
held in original hands, having been
well distributed and never actively
traded in, and for those reasons not
carefully protected by supporting or
ders in .the stock market, technical
conditions are presented which permit
of violent and sudden price move
ments, which may be only remotely re
lated to the question of actual values.
The neglect Into which a long list of
securities has fallen in the daily trad
ing in sto9ks in itself makes them un
desirable as collaterial for loans by
banks, which It Is Important should
be instantly convertible into cash by
selling of loans and marketing of col
lateral. The course of prices this week
under this process is an effective dem
onstration of the unsuitableness of
much of the collateral for the purpose
for which it was held: There was lit
tle specific news to account for the
movements in this department. In
fact, there was a notable tendency for
the violent breaks to occur on what
could be regarded as good news, such
as dividend declarations on preferred
stocks, concerning which vague rumors
of doubt may have been current. Dis
trust of the whole industrial outlook
and a. conviction that reaction and con
traction, such -as have been demon
strated in the iron and steel trade,
must be faced In all lines of industry,
were at work In causing this move
ment.
STOCKS UNDER SUSPICION.
The whole fabric of the organization
of industrial corporations is under sus
picion, and every new evidence of in
sufficiency of working capital, where
liberal dividends have been distributed
and of new capital Issues ahead of
stocks to supply this deficiency, serve
to Intensify this suspicion and aggra
vate the pressure' of securities on the
narrow market. Behind the present
situation loomed up a prospect of new
competition when industry shall revive.
Many of the consolidatior.3 on which
present inflated capital issues have
been made are seen to have been ef
fected at extravagant valuations, so
that room is left for duplication of fa
cilities at a smaller outlay of capital
on which return must be secured. .The
extension of the term of the Interna
tional Mercantile Marine Underwriting
Syndicate from December 1, upon
which It was to expire, to March 1, 1905,
is interpreted as a measure of the pres
sent hoplelessness of flotation of in
dustrial securities and the earliest
period within which ally revival may
be looked for.
The comparative firmness of the
United States Steel securities during
the renewed scaling down of values In
other quarters goes to show that an ad
justment of the whole list to the basis
fixed in that premier/ security as a
standard has been in some sort in
tendea. 2n the general-, market the
movement" has been a soft of marking
timejh waiting for the fall money con
ditions to work themselves out.
ENGLAND IS RETRENCHING.
Further gold has started from Lon
don, but on i a limited scale, and: the
Bank of England, has used the custom
ary means to protect the London stock
of gold. Liberal supplies of exchange
have comelntb the New York market
and It is commenly believed that 'a> part'

A BR.YSON IN GOLD.
Free With Next Sunday's Call
Greater San Francisco's Greatest Paper.
Nearly Every One II The Art Supplements
Says So: II Are the Hit of the Year.
The second of Bryson's "Series in Gold," entitled "Sedorah,"
surpawe? the first and w21 be given away FBJIE with THE
SUNDAY CALL, December 6th.
"SEDORAH" & I
* i '" 1 """" " ' % |
"Sedorali" Is the title of our next offering. That %
we know it will please goes without saying. Having ||
gained the approval of the most critical judges, it ' H
cannot fail to be highly regarded and preserved by pjj !
the patrons of The^anday Call. g i
"Sedorah" represents a rare type of beauty, in ft
that a peculiar piquancy is given to the expression g i
of the face of the young girl by the wealth of gold- |j
en hair and her dark eyes. The richness of her S j
blond tresses is heightened b'y the pearls and roses, H j
carelessly arranged in her coiffure, and the contrast- Â§j
ing background and the diaphanous drapery give jj
warmth and brilliancy to the flesh tones. M j
* In treatment, this picture approaches skctchi- H j
ness, and this quality may account to some extent y ,
for its brilliancy and effectiveness. It seems to Si
have been conceived and executed with a single im- n !
pulse, with none of the changing and retouching that *jj I
are responsible for the labored and ofttimes unshill- y I
ful aspect of the work of some artists. H i
' Printed on heavy paper and surrounded by a |]
rich gold border, it is the most decorative and at- Ej ;
tractive art picture that has been produced in Ameri- N
ca, let alone given away. j|
If you overlooked getting the first of the Series g
in Gold, you surely cannot afford to miss this. *. . H ;

Potatoes continued to arrive freely and the
market was easy for low. grade offerings.
Fancy Salinas were In limited supply and
steady, while ordinary offerings of river and
Oregon Burbanks were . plentiful and weak.
There were no freeh Sweet Potatoes received,
but the market was liberally supplied with
carried-over stocl:, which waa in fair request.
Onions were unchanged and sales of choice
Oregon ex-steamer. w*re reported at $1 Ht*J>
1 25 per ctl.
There were liberal receipts of vegetables from
Los Angeles and choice lots met with quick
sale at good prices. Mort of the receipts of
Peas and String Beans were of poor quality,
showing effect* of the wet" weather in the
south, and were hard to Pell at any price.
There' were moderate receipts of Lima Beans,
chltfly pocr stock, .from nearby sections, and
the quotations had a -wide range. The quota
tions* for bay Tomatoes were obtained only
for fancy stock, which formed but a sma.ll
percentage of the receipts. Poor lots, which
constituted the bulk of the supplies, were
very dull and a considerable quantity was sold
for canning" purposes at 15c per box. >

CHICAGO. Nov. 2S. â The wheat situation

' favorable Argentine crop advices, and while
j e prlng wheat receipts were light compared with
! last year, the receipts of winter wheat in the
I South were, again liberal and offset the sntallsr
j receipts In the Northwest. May opened %i&^ic
lower al SrvfiKCVic. but with the advance In
I December the price became slightly firmer, ad
; vancing to SO%e. The market held steady for
! a tlrr>e on buying hy St. Louis houses and by

I at Duluth for shipment* to Buffalo helped to
1 steady orlces. Toward the latter part of thÂ«

I the early gain was lo*t. the close being a
Â«hade lower at S0%<fTS0>,4c. December ranged
between S0@SO*4c closing with a Rain of Â»ic

Prospects of increasing receipts and an Im
| provement In grading subjected the corn market
I to considerable selling pressure, and as a result
I prices tended toward a lower level. Mny closed
' lower st 41%c. December closed H<ffi%c
I lower at 41 Tic.
Oats wtre Influenced largely by the action of
I other grains and prices ruled lower on local

Provisions were strong on good demand from
i local *horU> and foreigners. An advance of

The fruit market was quite active on local
account, as retailers were purchasing freely
for two days' requirements, but there was very
little doing In the shipping line. , Apples had
the most call and prices of choice and fancy
stock were well maintained. A car of strictly
fanry stock, chiefly Spitzenbcrgs, was received
from Honey Lake, Lassen County, and sales
were readily effected at $2 25 per box. The
usual quantity of Berries came in. but met
with a sluggish dc-mand and prices had a wide
range us to condition and quality. Fresh ar
rivals of Grapes in (-mull packages met with a
mir demand at steady prices, while carrltd
ovtr sf.ck. which was abundant, moved slowly
and dealf rs were offering liberal concessions In
order to clean up. Freshly arrived lots of large
l-ox** from Martinez i-old at *1Â®1 75 per box.
Old et<--ck. which hail been accumulating for
pome day*, was cleaned up to canners at $10
per ton. Persimmons eold at a wide range as
to quality nnd size of box. Pomegranates and
Quin.es were In email supply and prices stood
as previously quoted.
Citrus Fruits were in ample supply and
nulet. New Oranges end Grape Fruit moved

LONDON, Nov. 2S. â The offering at the
wool auction pales to-day were 11,024 bales.
There was a brisk demand for fine kinds at
steady prices. Low and inferior grades were
kIow. MoiÂ»t ol the crossbreds offered were
taken by the home trade. American buyers
secured a few lots of superior. France and
Germany competed for ecoureds. A good sup
ply of fine conditioned new clip caused spirited
competition. Withdrawals were frequent.
London Wool Sales.
Eggs are lower, not because of any increase
In receipts, but because there Is a general feel
ing, common to both buyers and sellers, that
the production is likely to Increase from now
on, and as the Thanksgiving demand is now
over it Is advisable to keep as closely sold up
as |>osslble. Hence receivers are making con
cisions and buyers are taking advantage of
them.
Cheese remains as befcre, the market being
heavily eupplitd and weak.
Butter Is quiet and weak, with heavy stocks
of seconds, which have to compete with the
rr.ore popular cold storage goods. Even the

overloaded with stock.

REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
"A person would scarcely believe that
a five-dollar bill with the word 'owing*
spelled 'ownig* could get into circula
tion, but this happened with a bank
note counterfeited after one of | the
Tamaqua, Pa., bank. In another in
stance the word 'thousand' came out on
the counterfeit 'thousaud.*
"Who pays attention to a cent â espe
cially in New York? But one gang
circulated bogus cents. They had a
good plate, but the copper they bought
was not of uniform quality and the In
dian's head came"out clumsily.
"These people operated largely in-
Boston and got- little eirls to put the
cents in circulation through Chinese
laundries, which use a lot of cents. The
girls would go to the laundries with
bundles of a hundred cents, of which
perhaps 30 per cent would Â» be good
coins, and they would get change from
the Chinamen. These counterfeiters
were caught finally.'
"He said at some point or other con
science was sure to prevent him from
making a perfect job at crooked work.
The only error in these bond plates was
ip the lath- work border. Up In one
corner of this border the counterfeit
was not uniform in Its lines. Â¦~.Qi
"Thomas Johnson, now dead, who
made the counterfeit Wlndom two-dol
lar notes, had a curious experience with
his plates. He made five plates, each
one wrong in. some minor particular. In
one plate the error was In the right
eye, which was so drawn that it gave
the portrait the appearance on close
examination of being cross-eyed.
"He said that when he was making
that part of the plate he was frightened
by some noise, a thing that would not
have bothered him in the least if he
was at honest work, as he was an ex
pert engraver. Had it not been for this
error the plate would have been a finer
one than the Government used, for it
gave a clearer Impression.
"In another plate he used he got the
letters in 'two* reversed, so that they
read 'owt,' and yet the bills printed
from that plate got into circulation.
. "Johnson was even a better engraver
than Ulrfch, and in each of the four
plates he made after the first one to
counterfeit this bill he endeavored to
correct an error, yet In each one he
made another error. He simply could
not help it, he said, so long as he was
at the crooked work.
"His last errorâ that is, the one on
the last of the five platesâ was in the
treasury numbers. In that the '8* was
not uniform with the rest of the nume
rals. So throughout the series of plates
he would correct one error only to
make another, tind no effort would save
him from making- one.
A MISSPELLED WORD.
CONSCIENCE INTERFERED.
"It is apparently an absolute impos
sibility for a- man to make a perfect
counterfeit coin or note." said William
P. Hazen, formerly chief of the United
States secret service, a few days ago.
"It is certain," he continued, '.'that a
perfect counterfeit has never been
made, and, strange as it may appear,
with all the will and endeavor in the
world, the counterfeiters seem to be
wholly unable to complete a perfect
Job, although they get many details of
the bill or coin to absolute perfection.
"Some strange power appears to get
possession of these criminals at a cru
cial moment in their fraudulent work,
and to render their art vain. The real
reason for this I have never been able
to fathom.
"It may be psychic. .You may smile â
some people will â but the criminals
themselves, so far as I have ever
talked with them on the subject after
we have captured them, have indicated
to me that they believe it is conscience
which balks them."
During his term as head of the secret
service Mr. Hazen had a large experi
ence with counterfeiters, the record
for captures those years being a larger
one than later Â¦ times have shown.
Having noted that all counterfeits were
defective in some particular, he made
inquiries "as to the reason of thl3.
It is not, by the way, always by rea
son cf a defect that a counterfeit is
detected. .Sometimes suspicion is raised
merely by an Indefinable feeling on the
part of a Treasury or bank employe
that a bill or coin does not look or feel
just right, and then examination dis
closes the fatal error in the bogus
money.
"Even the most expert engravers,"
Mr. Hazen said, "and It of course is
well known that some of the best have
gone into the counterfeiting business,
cannot turn out , in their counterfeit
work the perfect results which they
can readily get in legitimate work.
With counterfeit bonds it is the same
as with notes and coin.
"One of the most remarkable* cases
occurred with the counterfeiting of the
old United States 7-30's by the notorious
Brockway-Smith gang. One of the
members of that gang got his freedom
by offering Xo go to Washington and
pick out the spurious from the good
bonds, for the Government experts
themselves could riot do it at first. He
was Charles Ulrich, who* is straight
now, one of the few of whom that can
be said.

Fever, violent retching fits, a thick
coated tongue, indicated the agency of
some virulent substance, though the
patient persisted in making light of all
those symptoms.
"Just a stomach trouble," he would
remark between . peeps at his photo
graph album. "I had those spells ever
since I was a youngster; got used .to
them after a fashion; they don't bother
me any more than a fit of hiccoughs."
Pitting cunning against cunning,
they got up a musical entertainment for
his special benefit, and during his ab
sence overhauled his room in all cran
nies. Eight different bottles, with as
many different nondescript mixtures,
were thus picked from their hiding
places. He had tried his Â¦ luck with
more than one metallic oxide (verdi
gris, etc.). with red Ink. hartshorn and
a villainous melange of curds and old
meat scraps corked up and left to fer
ment in the hope that they would de
velop some sort bf sausage poison.
REPENTANCE OFTEN FEIGNED.
A favorite trick of would-be self
destroyers Is feigned repentance.
"My surroundings were to blame,"
the close guarded patient will Inform
his doctor. "Uncongenial company drove
me, mad, but in my; present retreat I

. "Let's make the best of this chance
and have a glass of lemonade." he
urged his nurse, and during her ' mo
mentary absence contrived to wrench
off the stout wire that formed the han
dle of his pall.
With the aid of a little stone he had
picked up in the garden, and using his
blanket to muffle the sound, he then
ground one end of the wire to a needle
point and proceeded to pierce his left
side in all directions. When they, tried
to awake him the next morning they
found his heart had stopped beating.
That ice pall was ruined and had to be
flung away, but it had answered the*
purpose of curing his fever forever.
RESORTS TO SUBTERFUGE.
A patient In the model sanitarium at
Sonnenstein, near Dresden, Saxony,
tried all sorts of tricks to get hold ot
some iron Imprement that could be
used as a substitute for a dirk knif?,
and finally founded a successful
scheme on the circumstance that sucb
symptoms of fever as a quick pulse
carV be stimulated by any physical ef^
fort. ' ......
"Did you hear the names she called
me?" shouted the "trusty," shaking
her weapon in the air.
The cunning lunatic h*d accom
plished her purpose by insulting the
"trusty" and taunting her until her
own half crazed mind gave way and
she turned to punish her insulter with
the first weapon she could find.
Crazy King Ludwlg of Bavaria
grinned triumphantly when his cus
todians consented to let him take a
stroll through the park under escort
of an athletic physician. That payk
bordered upon a deep lake, and even
the patron of Richard Wagner had
brains enough left to know that a good
swimmer risks to be drowned by an
awkward friend, and that the best
swimmer must perish in the clutch of a
foe determined to sink.
When the attainment of their fixed
purpose Is at stake lunatics are capable
of baflling suspicion by remarkably
clever combination games.
The difficulty of watching all the
gates through which it would be possi
ble for an insane person to take his
life was illustrated not long ago in a
Massachusetts asylum, where an elder
ly woman had been sent with the dis
tinct understanding that her life could
be saved only by the most vigilant
watching.
The patient was kept under constant
surveillance. The suspect did not ob
ject, but she watched and waited. One
afternoon the nurse left her alone, a
moment in the custody of one of the
"trustees," a woman of fierce temper,
but almost sane and absolutely trust
worthy. The nurse had been gone but
a few moments, when a number. of
piercing cries were heard.
INCITES NUHSE TO MURDER.
Rushing" back, she found her patient
dead and the "trusty" standing over
her with a hatchet.
A lunatic bent on self-destruction Is
the most cunning, crafty human being
in existence. The mind of the normal
man is no match for the unbalanced
person who has determined to commit
suicide. To- prevent self-destruction
on the part of lunatics thus determined
has been a life study on the part of
noted alienists, but : no satisfactory re
sults ever were obtained.

to assist in getting up a first-class ex
hibition of the county's minerals to
send to the exposition at St. Louis next
year. Mr. Madeira, one of the collec
tors, has been in Nevada City. It is
possible that Nevada County will fur
nish the best gold exhibit of any coun
ty. The work of collecting samples for
show has been proceeding in the higher
mountain counties that they might be
taken down for shipment to San Fran
cisco before the winter weather sets In
severely. The Shasta County copper ex
hibit, has already been mentioned. It
will be among the finest* at St. Louis.
All collections of minerals to go to St.
Louis must be completed within the
next six weeks."
Connection has been made between
the' North Star and the Central Shaft
mines at Grass Valley. VTears of work
are summed up by this announcement.
The Central Shaft connection was
planned long ago. The project led to
the sinking In. the Central Shaft mine
to a' vertical depth of 1600 feet. Then
the work of connecting the \ two mines
was taken under consideration. The
project has been pursued with little In
terruption. The -Grass Valley Tidings,
In addition to stating that the work of
putting the raise through and much
development work has been completed,
has the following: .
NEVADA IS IN LINE.
At Haskell Peak considerable work has
been done this season. Captain Wilbourn
struck a good prospect In gravel and has fit
ted up his mine in good er-ape for next sea
son's work." Joe Perry has also obtained a Rood
prospect in gravel in that Eection and expects
to do considerable work there next spring. The
contractors at the New Enterprise mine at
liattlesnake are getting along well, and have
nearly completed the 300-foot tunnel. They ex
pect to strike gravel most any day, as lava
has come In at the' roof of the tunnel.
At Forest there is considerable work going
on In the mining line. The Young America
gravel mine has been- bonded to a San Jose
company, vhich will do considerable develop
ment work this winter. Thomas Ransom, who
took out considerable gold recently In his mine
near Forest, has done considerable wark in im
proving the property, and has a good prospect
of taking out more specimens. At the Diadem
Mr. Harper ia having the shaft sunk, and
some good ore has recently been found. At
American Hill J. M. Harper has a force of
men running a tunnel for gravel.- He expects
to run about 4(n> feet before making an up
raise. There is every Indication of a gravel
channel existing In the ridge, which is all lava
capped.
The Oriental Company near Alleghany will
soon have their 1800-foot tunnel completed, and
when the ledge is encountered It will be one of
the largest mines. In the county. .--. . .
Considerable activity Is colng on In the vi
cinity of Chipps Flat, and the. opening up of
several mines there gives plenty of employ
ment to miners. The same may also be said in
regard to other portions of the county. Â¦ In the
northern section there is considerable activity.
In -and around. Sierra City considerable work is
being done. The Mountain mine is to be
opened. Â¦ -
Among the Sierra County properties
that are reported to be at work are
the Telegraph quartz' mine, nine miles
from Downieville, with five stamps
running steadily; the White , Bear
gravel r'mlne, where twenty-five men
are employed; the West Point mine,
which is worked by * Henry Spaulding and
others; the Poker T"lat and Rose and
Herald mines, upon which a lot of de
velopment work has been performed
during the last dry season; the Empire
mine at Gold Valley; the Oriental mine,
near Allegheny; the Plumbago, the
American Hill, Papoose and the El
more. The Downieville Messenger says
of various localities in Sierra County:
IN SIEBBA COUNTY,
The last ten days have seen a great many
of the mines uiound.thls tewn start up again,
as thera is now- plenty of water to keep them
going for many months to come. The first
mine to start was the Sultana, followed by the
Angels, the Oriole, the Gold Cliff and the Mad
ison mill. At the Cross t-haft water was
turned on instead of .steam; repair work is be
ing done at tnls shaft, while at the Madison
shaft the wat^r is being pumped out, prepar
atory to development - work. About 500 men
have been :uk to work during the last week,
so that now the camp is beginning to take on
'its old-time iouk of activity. The outside
mines are beginning to make preparations for
active work, and on Tuesday the old Calaveras
on Indian Creek received a new engine to be
used in working the property. The "43 mine
at Douglass Flat has resumed operations and
the water is now being: pumped out. This Is
a cravel proposition.
At the Eho mine, three miles east of Mur
phys. water f-.sr hydraullcklne was this week
piped from the Utica ditch. During the last
year a tunnel ISO feet long was run into the
side ot the mountain and two drifts made; a
large lot of powder was put in aog exploded,
literally tearing down the side of "he hill, so
that the hydraulic work can be carried on In
a rapid and thorough manner. Besides these
larger properties, a great number ot email
mines will be operated, so that the outlock for
a busy year is encouraging.
The brisk season in California mining
has returned. There is sufficient water
in the mountains to enable the mines
*.o operate. As a result the mine man
agers and those who are associated
with them are busy. There is a great
revival of activity in Sierra County,
according to the accounts furnished by
the local papers. Some new mines
have been discovered during the last
year and a great many old ones are
being reopened. Properties that have
been idle for a long time are being de
veloped. Altogether, so says the
Oovvnieville Mountain' Messenger, "Si
;rra County has a bright ititure."
A spirit of cheerfulness is found in
the papers of Calaveras County. The
