GENEVA, N. Y.. Aug. 3.â Jesse Hart,
i pretty young domestic of this town,
received word to-day from Seattle. Wash.,
that her uncle, James L. Hawley, a mine
owner, had died leaving her his entire
fortune of f2 ,OW.OO0.
MIfs Hart Is engaged to marry a young

according to the provisions of her uncle's
tvil! # ehe must, in order to inherit his for
tune, marry Jerome Medley of Dawson
City, Alaska, whom she has never seen.
Otherwise the money will go to other rela
tives or to charity. A letter to Miss Hart
from a Seattle lawyer says that the young
man is the son of her dead uncle's chum,
Joseph Medley, who went West from Chi
cago with the deceased Hawley in 1835.
"I shall make up my mind in a few
days." the said. "If I give up my in
tended husband I lose a vast fortune.
My uncle was always queer. He was at
tached to the young man named in the
will and undoubtedly wished his family
blood linked with ours."
INCREASED FREIGHT RATES
TO THE PACIFIC COAST
CHATTANOOGA. Tcnn.. Aug. 9.â The
manufacturers of Chattanooga have been
notified by the various railroads that be
ginning September 1 there will be an in
crease on freight consigned to the Pa
cific States, the advance to be equal to
the rate between ail Southern points and
the Mississippi River. The increased
rates will affect all shippers south of the
Ohio and east of the Mississippi rivers.
- All freight received in this territory
from the Pacific States or imported goods
coming by way of San Francisco will be
subjected to the same Increase as goods
ehixped from here.
The Foreign Minister has informed the
representatives of the powers that the
| Government will use its utmost endeavors
i to quell all unrest in Bulgaria occasioned
by the events In Macedonia, but the pow
ers must do their part to take the neces
sary steps to induce the Porte to stop the
persecution of the innocent and the em
ployment of Bashi-Bazouks in suppress
ing the revolution. The massacre likely
to follow the letting loose of the Bashi-
Bazouks, added the ' Minister, is likely to
precipitate the movement in Bulgaria In
tfavor of the revolution and thus force the
hand of the Government,"
The Bulgarian Ministry Is closely watch
ing the situation In Macedonia and has
decided to increase the frontier forces.
Orders have been telegraphed to the fron
tier authorities to redouble their vigilance
and prevent all unauthorized persons, as
well as insurgent bands, crossing the
Turkish frontier. ' *
"The fighting area is widening and will
gradually embrace f very villayet in Mace
donia until the autonomy of the country
has been gained by force of arms or by
the Intervention of .those great powers
which desire peace. Not until then will
we lay down our arms."
The Macedonian revolutionary commit
tee is now drawing up and will shortly
circulate a declaration addressed to the
powers explaining Macedonian grievances
and the object of the revolution.
SOFIA, Bulgaria, Aug. 9.â "Nothing caji
end the present revolution in Macedonia
until our national aspirations are satis
fied or those fighting to attain them are
exterminated."
This was the concluding sentence of a
statement made to-day to the correspond
ent of the Associated Press who is Inves
tigating the situation in Macedonia by
the Macedonian committee at the revolu
tionary headquarters here. .
Boris Saraffof, the head and front of the
movement, is with the insurgents In
Macedonia. Ills representatives here be
lieved that the desired results would be
gained through the present movement.
\ "The object of the present rising," said
the Macedonian committee, "is to win re
form which will assure the Christian peo
ple of Macedonia security for their lives
and property and the right to participate
in the administration of the country.
"The present revolutionary organization
came into existence nine years ago, when
the persecution of the Bulgarian popula
tion of Macedonia became flagrant. To
day all Macedonia is embraced in the
movement, and though it. was not Intend
ed to strike so soon, because the prepara
tions for the rising were not sufficiently
completed, the recent outrages of the
Turks, the massacres of the innocent, the
pillaging of villages and the extortion of
heavy fines on various pretexts so exas
perated all that the insurrection was de
cided upon, no matter what might be the
outcome.

Vellejo reports having seen the Heine
shortly before the disaster occurred. He
rays she ha<i ail sails set and was in
danger at that time, as a stiff breeze was
blowing. Many of the residents of
Vallejo. reports having seen the Heine
Cove to-day and as the ill-fated yacht
\cas headed for that point when It sank
it was for a time feared that the list of
browned would be found to be much
greater than at first reported. It was
learned late this afternoon, however, that
only four lost their lives. As the flotilla
of yachts headed homeward with flags
flying at half matt to-night it was a
E'.ght which brought sorrow to the hearts
of every citizen of this town. The most
profound sympathy is felt for the fam
ilies of those who went down to tfcath in
the yacht.
The Heine was a 30-foot Eloop owned
End built by Har.son and it is eaid was
not properly ballasted. Hanson was
Â¦warned that the yacht was not safe with
out more ballast and boatmen who were
aware of her condition were not sur
prised to learn of the disaster.
The only eyewitness to the accident
f o far known, was a lady on the Crockett
shore who saw the yacht sikk. She
quickly spread the alarm.
The steamer Dauntless was tied up at
the Crockett sugar mill and as soon as
the members of the crew learned of the
disaster they started out in a small boat,
but before they reached the spot where
the yacht sunk the men had disappeared
Jjeneat-h the waves.
BENICIA. Aug. 9.-The yacht Heine.
formerly the Trilby, of the Vallejo Yacht
Club, capsized In the bay off Crockett
this morning while beating her way to
Glen Cove in a heavy gale and sank, car
rying her crew of four men to the bot
tom of Carquinez Straits. The crew
consisted of William Hanson, David Wil
eon, Emile Chilene and Herman fcralomon.
Hanson was t!*e owner of the yacht and
was employed by the Government as chief
machinist at ILare Island navy yard. He
was attached to the torpedo boat de
etroyer Perry and was in charge of the
engines when that craft carried President
Roosevelt to Vallejo and Mare Inland in
May last. Wilson was employed In S.
M. Levee's dry gooSs store in Vallejo.
His relatives Ijx'e in Kansas. Salomon
and Cfc:jÂ«?ne were prominent business men
or Vallejo and both leave families to
mourn their Iocs.

"Men who have been guilty of a crime
like rape or murder should be visited with
ewift and certain punishment and the just
effort made by the courts to protect them
in their rights should under no circum
stances be perverted into permitting any
mere technicality to avert or delay their
punishment. â¢ The substantial rights of
the prisoner to a fair trial must, of course,
be guaranteed, as you have so Justly in
sisted. That they should be made subject
to this guarantee the law must Â¦ work
swiftly and surely and all the agents of
the law should realize the wrong they do
when they permit justice to be delayed
or thwarted"' for technical or insufficient
reasons. We must show that the law is
"Moreover, every effort should be made
under the law to expedite the proceedings
of justice in the case of such an awful
crime, but It cannot be necessary In order
to accomplish this to deprive any citizen
of the fundamental rights to be heard In
his own defense which are so dear to us
and which lie at the root of our liberty.
It certainly ought to be possible by the
proper administration of the laws to se
cure swift vengeance upon the criminal,
and the immediate efforts of all legisla
tors. Judges and citizens should be ad
dressed to securing such reforms in our
legal procedure as to leave no vestige of
excuse for those misguided men who un
dertake to reap vengeance through vio
lent methods. .
"All men must feel the gravest alarm
over the growth of lynching in this coun
try", and especially over the peculiarly
hideous forms so often taken by mob vio,
lence when colored men are the victims,
on which occasions the mob seems to lay
most weight not on the crime, but on the
color of the criminal. In a portion of these
cases the man lynched has been guilty of
a crime terrible, horrible beyond descrip
tion, a crime so horrible that as far as he
himself Is concerned he has forfeited the
right to any kind of sympathy* whatso
ever.
"The feeling of all good citizens that
such a hideous crime shall not be hideous,
ly punished by mob violence is due not in
the '.east to sympathy for the criminal, but
to a very lively sense of the train of
dreadful consequences which follow the
course taken by the mob In exacting in
human vengeance for an inhuman wrong.
In such cases, .moreover, it is well to re
member that the criminal not merely sins
against humanity in unpardonable fash
ion, but sins particularly against his own
race, and dots them a wrong far greater
than any white man can possibly do
them. Therefore in such cases the col
ored people throughout the land should in
every possible way show their belief that
they, more than all others in the com
munity, are horrified at the commission
of such a crime and are peculiarly con
cerned in taking every possible measure
to prevent its recurrence and to bring the
criminal to immediate Justice. The slight,
est lack of vigor, either in denunciation
of the crime or in bringing the criminal to
justice, Is itself unpardonable. '
LAW SHOULD BE SWIFT.
GROWTH OF LYNCHING.
"My Dear Governor: Permit me to
thank you as an American citizen for the
way in which you have vindicated the
majesty of the law by your recent action
in reference to lynching. 1 feel, my dear
1 sir, that you have made all men your
debtors who believe, as all far-seeing
men must, that the well beingâ indeed,
the very existenceâ of the republic de
pends upon that orderly liberty under the
law which Is Inccmpa table with mob vio
lence as with any, other form . of jdespo-
Usm. Of course, mob violence is simply
one form of anarchy;. and anarchy is now,
as it always will be. the handmaiden and
forerunner of tyranny.
"I feel that you have not only reflected
honor unto the State which for its good
fortune has you as its chief executive,
but upon the whole nation. It is Incum
bent upon every man throughout this
country not only to hold up your hands
in the course you have been following,
but to show his realization that the mat
ter is one of vital concern io us all. . â¢
OYSTER BAY, N. Y.. Aug. 9.â In a let
ter, the publication of which was author
ized to-day. President Roosevelt com
mends Governor Durbin of Indiana for
the attitude he assumed recently respect
ing lynching. The President also em
braces the opportunity to express his own
views In reference to lynching and mob
violence as one form of anarchy, and that
anarchy a forerunner of tyranny. The
President vigorously urges that the pen
alty for crimes that induce a resort to
lynching shall be applied swiftly and sure
ly, but by due process of the courts, so
that it may be deemed strictly "that the
law is adequate to deal with crime by
freeing It from every vestige of technical
ity and delay."

Governor Durbin follows:

"Moreover, tho history of these recent
cases shows the awful fact that when the
minds of mm are habituated to the use ot
torture by lawless bodies to avenge crimes
of a peculiarly revolting description, other
lawless bodies will use torture In order to
punish crimes of an ordinary type.
"Surely no natrlot can fail . to see the
f earful brutalization and debasement which
the Indulgence of such a spirit and such
practices- inevitably portend. Surely, all
public men, all writers for the dally press,
all clergymen, all teachers, all who In any
way have a right to address the public
should with every energy denounce such
crimes and. to support those engaged in
putting i them down. As a people we
claim the right to speak with peculiar
emphasis for freedom and for, fair treat
ment of all men without regard to dif
ference of race, -fortune, creed or color.
We forfeit the right so to speak when we
commit or condone such crimes as those
of which I speak. .
"The nation, like the individual, cannot
commit a crime with impunity. If we are
guilty of lawlessness and brutal violence,
whether our guilt consists in active par
ticipation therein or; in mere connection
ana encouragement, we shall assuredly
suffer later on because of what we have
done. ,The cornerstone of this republic,
as of all free governments, is respect for
and obedience to the law. Where we per
mit the. law to be defied or evaaed,
whether by rich man or poor man, black
man or white man. we are by just so'
much weakening me bonds of our civili
zation and increasing the chances of its
overthrow and of the substitution there
for of a system. In which there shall be
violent altercations of . anarchy and
tyranny. Sincerely yours,'
"THEODORE ROOSEVELT."
USE OF T0BTUB.E.
. "In the recent cases of lynching over
three- fourths were not for rape at all,
but for murder, attempted murder and
even less heinous offenses. .
"This matter of lynching would bo a
terrible thing even If It stopped with the
lynching of men guilty of the inhuman
and hideous crime of rape; but as a mat
ter of fact, the lawlessness of this type
never does stop and never can stop in
such fashion. Every violent man in the
community is encouraged by every case
of lynching. In which the lynchers go un
punished, to take the law into his own
hands whenever it suits his own con
venience. In the same way the use of
torture by the mob in certain cases i3
sure to spread until it is applied more or
less indiscriminately in other cases. The
spirit of lawlessness grows with what it
feeds on, and when mobs with impunity
lynch criminals for one cause, they are
certain to begin to lynch real or alleged
criminals for other causes. - .
-"It. is, of course, inevitable that where
vengeance is taken by a mob it should
frequently faJl on innocent people and for
the wrong done in such a.. case there is
no remedy. But even where criminals aro
reached, 1 the wrong done by the mob to
the community' itself is well nigh as
great. Especially Is this true where the
lynching is accompanied with Â¦ torture.
There are certain hideous sights which
when once seen can never be wholly
erased from the mental retina. The mere
fact of having seen them implies degra
dation. This is a thousandfold stronger
when, instead of merely seeing the deed,"
the man has participated in It. Whoever,
In any part of our country, has ever tak
en part in lawlessly putting to death a
criminal by the dreadful torture of fire
must forever after have the awful spec
tacle of his handiwork seared into hi. -5
brain and soul. He can never again be
the same man.

ft from every vestige of technicality and

."But the fullest recognition of the. hor
ror of the crime and the most complete
laok of sympathy with the criminal can
not in the least diminish our horror at the
way in which it. has been, customary, to
avenge their crimes and at the conse
quences that are already; proceeding
therefrom.

The attempt upon the life of the Prime
Minister caused great excitement and the
crowd pointed out to the police the author
of the attempt, a man dressed in flsher
man'3 clothing. His companion drew a
but the police quickly disarmed him-
The police had much difficulty In protect
ing the man who had fired the shots from
the crowd. He struggled desperately, but
was soon overcome, handcuffed and taken
to the prefecture, where M. Combes had
already arrived. The first interrogation of
the prisoner took place In the presence of
the Premier.
The man said his name was San \alre
Plcolo. Ho spoke very bad French, with
a strong Italian accent. He denied that
he had flred the shots, but when searched
a revolver was found with two chambers
which had been recently fired.
It is believed that Plcolo and his com

CHEYENNE, W'yo., Aug. 9.â Tom Horn,
the condemned murderer of little Willie
Klckoll, and Jim McCloud, in custody for
postofflce robbery, escaped from the
county jail at 8:40 o'clock this â¢ morniijg
after overpowering Deputy Sheriff Proc
tor, but were recaptured after a brief but.
exciting chase. The ringing of fire bells
brought hundreds of armed citizens to
the scene, and it looked for a time as
though a lynching would take place, but
the escapes were hurriedly brought back
to the Jail and placed In their cells be
fore the crowds could form themselves
Into a mob. The men did not get but two
blocks away before they were retaken.
The plot which led to their escape was
well planned. Horn and McCloud were
the only prisoners confinea on the upper
floor of the Jail. They occupied steel
cells, eo arranged that communication
was comparatively easy. This morning
McCloud complained to Deputy Proctor of
being ill and requested some medicine and
a glass of water. Upon returning with
the. articles asked for Proctor discovered
that the men had lef$ their cells, which
were not locked, and had walked to the
end of the corridor through which they
were allowed to exercise. When Proctor
.opened the. door to the corridor he was
pouiiced upon by the two men and se
curely bound with a cord which they had
secured in some- manner. Horn and Mc-
Cloud demanded .that he give them .his
keys, and, although Proctor . had them
on his person, he replied that they were
locked up in the safe. Proctor was then
conducted to where the safe stood and
directed to open it. The order was obeyed,
but on opening the aafe Proctor snatched
from Inside a gun and turned on the men.
They were too quick for him. however,
and* soon bore him down.. In the brief
struggle vProctop fired his revolver at
them four times, slightly wounding Mc-
Cloud. The shooting attracted the at
tention of Deputy Snow, who hastened to
the scene, but was met at the doorway
by McCloud. who had secured possession
of a shotgun In some manner. Snow re
treated and Horn and McCloud escaped
through a rear door of the Jail, after
binding the arms of Deputy Proctor.' Mc-
Cloud secured the only horso In the
Sheriff's stable and mounted the animal
arid started toward the west Horn ran
in the opposlto-'direotlon. â¢' : â¢ -
About this time Sheriff Smalley arrived
on the scene and started in .pursuit of
McCloud, firing his revolver without
effect. After a short chase McCloud sur
rendered.'When Horn left the Jail yard
the fact that he wore no hat and carried
a revolver attracted the attention of O.
M. Elurich, who operates an amusement
stand across the street. Eldrich gave
chase, firing several shots at Horn, one
of which grazed his neck. Horn, slightly
wounded, turned and aimed his revolver
at Eldrich, but the gun being of an auto
matic lock pattern, one with which Horn
was unfamiliar, he was unable to dis
charge it, and, realizing his helplessness,
Horn surrendered just as Eldrich was
about to shoofagain. When Eldrich ap
proached Horn, the latter showed fight,
but was beaten Into submission by hia
plucky pursuer. By this time numbers of
officers and citizens had gathered at the
spot, and Horn, bleeding from his wounds,
was dragged back to the jail. Quiet pre
vails now and there Is no probability of
an attempt being made to lynch the Jail
breakers.

at St. Â¦ Peter's to-day not a single un
toward incident occurred and the perfect
order is attributed to the good organi
zation of the military - and the police.
Premier Zanardelll, although not well, re
mained in Rome purposely to direct the
policy, of government. He left immedi
ately after the coronation, saying:

"I offer aa aft of obedience to your

The Cardinal recalled that the bodies
of the first Pcipo and of St. Paul rested
In the basilica, which fact, he said, was
of good augury ;for tho work of the new
head of the Catholic church.
The Pontiff *nis visibly touc%ed, and.
answering in a arembling voice., warmly
thanked the Cardinals for their well
wishes;.

The people in tbnÂ» basilica had in the
meantime beoom* impatient, and when
the gleaming cross "which ' preceded the
cortege was seen it Â¦was., greeted with
rreat applause. On CÂ»e appearance of the
Pontiff himself it socmed as though the
people would peek to. carry him In their
arms so .great was their .enthusiasm.
Cries of "Pius, our .Pope, our father!"
and "Long live Pius X!" were raised, not
withstanding tho large placards posted
throughout the basilica, saying "Acclama
tions are forbidden." I*eaflets to the same
effect were distributed among the crowd.
The cries continued unlU the Pontiff was
compelled to arise and bless the multi
tude and at the same tljne he made a sign
for more reverential behavior. Silence
was enforced when the' choir announced
Hs entrance with the "Etecesacredos Mag

The procession was a long time in get

In front marched the Cardinals, a gor

faces among them, the Cardinal-Bishops
in their capes, the. Cardinal-priests wear
ing chasubles and the CardinaJ-deaeons
in their delmatics.
Another figure which evoked murmurs
cf admiration and craning of necks was
thÂ« chaplain, in his crimson cape, proudly
bearing the cushion on which reposed the
famous triple crown, so soon to rest on
the head of Pius X. He was accompanied
by the pontifical Jeweler and by a special
jruard composed of Swiss, and was fol
lowed by the choir of the SIstine chapel.
Before leaving tho Vatican the Pope
went to thei SistinÂ© Chapel to worship
before th? sacrament exposed therein:
Â¦tliea he passed through the sala regia and
the Constantlne staircase into the porti
co of the basilica. He there seated him
self on a throne erected directly before

the members of the Sacred College, the
chapter of St. Peter's and the papal court.

Juft before entering the sedla gestato

evinced no nervousness, and even said
lokinjrly to the master of ceremonies,
tÂ« ho tbe other day suggested # that he
Ehould use the plural form in speaking of
himself:
The procession then proceeded^ tbÂ«
Pope's face meanwhile illuminated by a
smile. At the chapel of the sacrament
there was another halt and his Holiness
left the eedan chair and prayed at the
altar. On re-entering the chair he was
carried to the chapel of St. Gregory,
where he officiated at mass, being as
sisted by Cardinals Macchi, Dl Pletro,
Segna and Vannutelli. Then all tha Car
dinals donned their silver capes and
white mitres and thÂ« Pope was borne to
the throne amid renewed acclamations
and waving of handkerchiefs and bats.
Then was presented a magnificent pic
ture to which no pen could do justice.
The central figure was the venerable
Pontiff, seated on the throne. Two lines
of Cardinals clad In sliver and scarlet
reached to the high altar, with Its burden
of -burning candles and sacred vessels,
while around stood the papal guards, the
Pontifical court, monks and officials. The
cathedral was illuminated with twinkling
lights, while the marble columns and
walls rendered the color schema more
vivid. Overhead was the most magnifi
cent dome in the world, up to which
floated the harmony of the muclc.
From thÂ« throne Pius X, surrounded
by his suite, walked to the -high altar.
standing over the crypt of St. Peter, into
which meanwhile Cardinal Macchi de
scended to pray. The altar was sur
mounted by a baldachlno supported by
four historic bronze pillars taken from
the Pantheon.
The appearance of the Pope in that
elevated position called for another
burst of enthusiasm. The Pore then
blessed the altar, and, after saying the
"Indulgentiagm" the maniple, a symbol
of the cord with whicli Christ was bound
on his capture, was placed, with great
ceremony, upon the Pope's arm. At the
same time prayers for the coronation were
recited by Cardinals Vannutelli, Mocennl,
Agliardi and Satolli.
Returning" 'from . the crypt Cardinal
Macchl placed upon the shoulders of the
Pope the Pontifical paJium and attached
It with three golden jeweled pins, say
ing; Â¦â¢. Â¦.-Â¦Â¦,
"Receive this sacred palium as a eym
bol of the fullness of the Pontifical office,
in honor of Almighty God. the xuost glor
ious Virgin Mary, his mother; the blessed
Apostles St. Peter and St. Paul, and the
holy Roman Catholic church. -..; -:-,
Mass was then celebrated with great
pomp and ceremony, the voice of the
Pope becoming gradually more firm until
It was even audible in the most distant
corner of the immense church.
Fallowing this Cardinal Macchl per
formed the rite of Incensing the Pope-,
whom he subsequently kissed three time*
on the cheek and chest, as did Cardinals
Eegna and Vannutelli.
SENIOR CARDINAL
DEACON BESTOWS
â¢ THE TRIPLE CROWN
On the Pope's return to the throne the
Cardinals offered their last obedience to
the . Pontiff, kissing- his hands and feet
and receiving embraces by him twice in
return. The bishops : and archbishops
kissed his foot and right knee, while the
abbots kissed only his foot The Holy
Father then walked to the shrine of St.
Peter for the culminating rites of the ex
tremely fatiguing ceremony. ' .
The whole Sacred College gathered about
the Pope, singing Palestrina's "Corona
Aurea Super Caput EJus," while the choir
burst forth Into song. Cardinal Macchl
then recited the Paternoster, and
offered the following prayer: :
Omnipotent and ever eternal God. dignitary
of the clergy and author of sovereignty, grant
thy servant. Plus X; grace to fruitfully govern
thy church so that he. who by thy clemency,
beccrnes and is crowned as father of kings
and rector of all the faithful, through thy wise
dispensation may govern well.
"Amen," rang out from all -corners of
the Cathedral, from the choir, the peo
ple, the clergy and the patricians.
Cardinal Deacon Segna then raised the
Pontiff's mitre and senior Cardinal Dea
con Macchl placed on the white head the
triple crown.
. At this moment the church was filled
with the ringing of bells, the blowing of
silver trumpets, the triumphant strains
of the choir and the acclamations of the
multitude, which could not be repressed.
When comparative silence had been re
stored Cardinal Macohi addressed the
Pope In Latin as follows:
Receive the tiara ornament, with three
crowns. Remember thou art father of princes
and kings ' the rector of the world, the vicar
on earth of our Savior, , Jesus Christ.
"Amen" again burst forth from the con
course. . .
Pope Pius X was. almost overcome and
had scarcely strength left to impart the
apostolic benediction. Cardinals Macchl
and Segna granted plenary indulgence to
all present and the procession then re
formed and left the basilica in the same
form as it came. :\- . ; : . \,
The Pope was -visibly fatigued and his
right hand shook as he raised Â¦ It time
after tiiru* to bestow his blessin?.
When the ceremony was overall exits
to the basilica were opened and * within
less than an hour the hall was empty.
POPE EXHAUSTED
BY THE ORDEAL OF
HIS CORONATION
Strong as PJus X is physically he sup
ported the ordeal of his coronation to-day
perhaps with less fortitude than did Leo
XIII when he was crowned, although
-Leo was -merely -a shadow -of a man.
But he possessed will which nothing
could break. This evening when the Pon
tiff received the Duke of Parma he said
to him:
Not counting the election, to-day was the
most tremendous .experience of mjt life. I
must find a way to stop the noise In the

will have a good opportunity to find a hid
ing, place in the mountains. If they at
tempt to swerve to the north thev will
find their progress practically impossible,
as the country is seamed with canyons
and covered with granite hills, the sides
of which are almost perpendicular.
Sheriff Bosquit said this afternoon: "I
believe a battle with the convicts is close
at hand. It may come either to-night or
to-morrow. It is the best trail we have
had since the men'left Pilot Hill. . I have
some splendid âmen in the El Dorado
County posse and they can be depended
upon' to fight to the last. The trailers
have joined the others now and all are
working together. If my instructions are
obeyed, there will ' be no ambushing by
the convicts. My men will corner the out
laws or drive them Into the trap set by
the Amador County posse at Leak Springs
and Corral Flats. I do not see any pos
sibility of escape for the fugitives. They
have come about to the end of their rope.
It is much easier trailing a body of men
in the (mountains than down nearer salt
water. The hounds are a great protec
tion to our men and an annoyance to the
convicts. It is my hope that our men
will come out of it unharmed."
Repairs are going on and trains will
move regularly to-morrow morning. T,he
storm last night was almost a cloudburst
in the vicinity, flooding ranches for some
distance. Rain was quite heavy in
Phoenix, but two miles east of here no
rain fell. Indications are for more rain
to-night.
PHOENIX. Ariz., Aug. 9.-Last night's

of here. In the space of two miles were
sixteen washouts, varying in length from
a few feet to several rods. Half a mile
the other side of Peoria the locomotive of
the passenger train due here at 1 o'clock
this morning was derailed. The train was
running slowly, looking for trouble. The
engine went over on the left side, the
fireman saving himself by jumping. En

caught, preventing him from jumping, but
he crawled out afterward, unhurt. No one

WOODLAND, Aug. 9.â H. M. Kaeding,
the San Francisco mining engineer who
came here for the purpose of identifying
the unknown man who was killed near
Davisville, Friday afternoon, scrutinized
the body again closely this morning, after
which he declared he had never seen the
man before. A young lady, who lives near
Davisville and who is employed In the
Foster Cannery, near Tremont, to-day
telephoned to The Call reporter that the
man had worked for two days in the Fos
ter Cannerv. and that she ate dinner at
the same table with him. She asked. his
name and he told her it was Jackson and
that he had recently arrived from Mon
tana.
The body could not be held any-longer
and was buried to-day by the Coroner.
BODY IS NOT IDENTIFIED.
Deputy Sheriff Hinters, who exchanged
shots with a suspect Friday night, keeps
his lonely vigil at the American River
bridge. The posses have been withdrawn
from the Yolo jungles. To-night the sit
uation in Sacramento was less promising
for the capture of the convicts than at
any time within , a week. It is believed
Fahey and Miller will not make a second
attempt to enter Sacramento, while the
activity of the Sheriff and Chief of Police
will probably discourage any other of the
fugitives from seeking shelter here.
Sheriff David Reese, his son Edward
Reese, and Deputy Sheriffs Hinters and
Wittenbrock are scouring the hilla around
Fair Oaks to-night in the hope of locat
ing convicts Fahey and Miller. The mem
bers of Kale's baseball team who passed
through Fair Oaks this morning, reported
that they met two men on the road.
Words were exchanged and the men said
they were on their way to Loomis. One
of the ball players had with htm a set
of photographs of the convicts and they
declared the two men were surely Mil
ler and Fahey. %
vest from the present excitement. All a
tramp has to do to insure distinguished
consldcration,from a farmer who a month
ago would have turned a dog on him is
to proclaim himself one of the escaped
convicts. After the farmer gives the
hobo all he asks and sees him headed
down the road, he posts off to the nearest
telephone and sends in news to the .Sheriff
of the visitation. The telephones of the
Sheriff's olflce are kept humming day and
night with such messages, and it requires
judgment to determine what reports
should be heeded and what disregarded.
SACRAMENTO. Aug. 9.â This proved
an uneventful day with the posses from
this city engaged in the hunt for the
escaped convicts. The man hunt has
developed a splendid crop of able-bodied
romancers, and if the Sheriff's officers
and police were to follow every clew
suggested to them they would be here,
there and everywhere at once. Only to
night the story was brought into the
Sheriff's office that a couple of the con
victs had appeared in a K street drug
store with false beards covering their
faces and demanded a supply of opium.
The yarn was given no heed by the offi
cers, despite the circumstantial manner
in which it was told.

He also asserted that he did not expect
to hear from Norman again until there
had been a battle. Meager reports which
reach here from the mountains indicate
that the outlaws have been discovered
and that the terrorized people of the
country will soon be relieved from the
strain of apprehension.
Forest Fire Threatens Downieville.
NEVADA, Aug. 9.â A forest fire that
started within half a mile of Downleville
Thursday evening has been raging fiercely
since that time. The flames to-day were
encroaching upon the suburbs of the town
from the south and threatened great dam
age. The residents of Downleville are
out fighting the fire. The fire has de
stroyed much young timber and property
that was in the woods. The mines In the
vicinity have watchmen and lire fighters

LOS ANGELES, AugÂ» 9.â Rev. Thomas
Conaty, Bishop of the diocese of Monterey
and Ix>s Angeles," started from Los An
geles this afternoon for a visit of inspec
tion to the Indian mission at Pala, where
the Warner Ranch Indians were recently
located, and to the Indian school of St.
Boniface, near Benning. This Inspection
is made with the purpose of forming plans
for the enlargement of the-work through
the income from the pious fund, a portion
of -which will soon be available for use
in this diocese. ;..;Â¦;

Under Sheriff Kay of Amador County
sent two mounted messengers to his supe
rior with the news. Another horseman
was dispatched later on the same errand,
so Norman might be sure to get the im
portant information. The Sheriff was pos
itive,that his men had been within a mile
of the desperadoes, and was reluctant to
leave for the new/station at Leak 8prtngs.
He finally divided his force, and with ten
men, left to co-operate with â¢ Bosquit's
posse. " Under ; Sheriff Kay said this even
ing that he felt sure the Amador County
mountaineers would meet " the convicts.
PLYMOUTH, Aug. 9.â Having become
convinced that the fugitive convicts have
taken another course, Sheriff Norman haa
"moved from his station near Wileys to
the neighborhood of Corral Flats. His in
tention Is to ambush the outlaws as they
flee from Bosquit's posse. The El Dorado
County Sheriff sent word yesterday to
Jackson that the convicts have turned
north from the Middle Fork of the Co
sumnos River.
Sheriff Norman Will Try to Ambush
the Fugitives at That Point.

SANTA R^SA, Aug. 9.â Elmer Toney
and Joe Snell, who had been out on a
hunting- trip on Brushy alountain, de
cided to smoke a beehive preparatory to
robbing it of its honey, and in so doing
caused a fire which destroyed many tons
of wheat hay and acres of stubble. In
addition several hundred yards of fencing
Â¦was burned. A spark from their brush
fire ignited the dry grass, and before its
spread could be prevented the wheat hay
had become ignited and burned. A stack
of grain belonging to Wiley English was
also burned.
Careless Hunters Start Big Fire.
BATTLE IS EXPECTED.
The officers here' believe the outlaws
will stand together for a battle and only
separate in , case of extremity. ' . The fugi
tives for the last two days have been tak
ing a course "toward Leak Springs, which
is situated â¢ only ', a : few ; miles from Silver
Lake. -They are" avoiding the hills as
much as Dosslble^ aa such ; traveling is
slow : and fatiguing. There are only two
or ' three '-, courses which they.: can pursue
and : men ' will ; be : stationed at each of
these points tc Intercept the. criminals.
. Corral Flats Is deemed the most likely.
As the day advanced the weather be
came fearfully hot and the men of the
posse began to suffer. Some of the pur
suers could not maintain a rapid gait and
the others were compelled to relax. The
hills are very steep and the trail led
through thick underbrush,! where prog
ress was difficult. It is believed the con
victs are aware of the proximity of the
posse and are exerting themselves to the
utmost. "^v V
Bosquit's men are not supplied with
any ' considerable . quantity of provisions.
This is another- unpleasant feature of the
case. Great apprehension is felt here
that some' of the brave men (who are en-,
deavorlng to rid this section. of the mur
derous jail breakers may not return alive.
Every <fne realizes that the desperadoes
will make .a fleht.for their lives if cor
nered. Each outlaw has a revolver and a
rifle with which he will attempt to bring
death to as many of his pursuers as pos
sible. Every precaution is being taken
that the convicts may not have any ad
vantage when the expected battle begins.
When the trail becomes , very ' fresh the
bloodhounds will be unleashed and al
lowed to locate the outlaws. Both hounds
are trained not to get close to the quarry.
One circles at. fifty and the other at a
hundred yards. Once the convicts are lo
cated, the : leaders of the _ posses can map
out a plan of slaughter, for there is no
thought of attempting to take any pris
oners.
vlcts yesterday morning. There the trail
ers and seven men from Bosquit's posse
met' and decided to hang together for a
time. All felt that the outlaws could not
be far distant. J. A. Spencer and Frank
Dyget from this city were on the scent
with bloodhounds.
At daylight this morning Richardson
awoke the posse and after a hasty break
fast the man hunters set out on the trail.
The party soon reached the Ben Meiss
place, where Joseph 'Bowman and Nash
Beru were held up yesterday noon. After
learning that the quarry was only a short
distance ahead the chase was renewed.
Dogs were with the party, but were not
used, as the trail left by the escapes was
as plajn as the road. The pursuers has
tened along with the trailers ahead, in or
der to avoid an ambush liku that at the
Grand Victory mine. At Meiss' ranch the
posse was just seventeen hours behind
the outlaws and traveling much faster
than them. Couriers were sent back at
intervals to inform the officials here of
the progress made.

Berue is well known throughout eastern
El Dorado County, and the officials say
implicit reliance may be placed on his
word. Bowman and he are herding sheep
together for Ben Meiss, who Is located on
the old Plummer ranch.
ORIZZLY FLAT, Aug. 9.-Five con
victs spent the hours from 12 to
â¢ 2 o'clock yesterday afternoon at J
the old Plummer sheep ranch,
fourteen miles east of this settle
ment. Xash Berue and Joseph Bowman
were held up by the outlaws and robbed
of all of their personal belongings, even
to the garments In which they were
clothed. The hunted felons ate a hearty
meal, rested themselves and after Inquir
ing the road to the summit took a course
In the direction of Jackson. Each convict
had a rifle, revolver and a largev supply
of ammunition/ Berue's shoes were stolen
from his feet, and he came into Grizzly
Flat this morning barefooted. -His ac
count of the visit of the outlaws follows:
"Bowman and I were home at the sheep
ranch yesterday," said he, "when we saw
five men with rifles coming toward us.
We did not know who they were, al
though we had suspicions. The men ftirae
up to us, and one with tattoo marks all
over his arm said, 'We want something to
eat.' I said, 'All right,' and they asked
me to cook for them. One of them helped
me. While we were getting the food
ready one of the men said, 'We have just
escaped from prison and we are trying to
get away. You must treat us as well as
you can.'
"They did not talk a great deal, nor
were they ugly. When they had finished
eating they looked around over the house
and commenced taking things, ffhey got
about all of our clothes and then went at
our grubstake. They loaded themselves
with eatables. When they left they had
all of our bacon, coffee, tea, sugar, bread,
rice and beans. One fellow with a big
scar on the head had worn his shoes out
and made me give him the only pair I
possessed. I did not feel like questioning
them very much, so I did not learn a
great deal about their past movements.
They asked me if I was going to tell
about their visit, and just then one of
them suggested that they take my horse.
They then took off the saddle and started
the animal down the woods road on .the
run. The man with the tattooed arm
asked the way to the summit. I told him,
and when they left it was in the direction
of Jackson, which is south, while the
mountains are to the east. One of the
fugitives said they wished they could pay
me, but they did not have a cent of
money. They kept calling one of the gang
'Little Dutchman.,' and he talked with a
German accent. They were hungry, all
right, but appeared to be in fine physical
condition and well able to stand plenty
of tramping. I had to come here without
my shoes, or not come; so here I am."
It is news that the convicts are out. of
money, for they have been distributing $5
gold pieces through the country ever since
they escaped from Folsom. Theron is the
man with the tattooed arm. Murphy has
several scars on his head. Miller is known
as "Little Dutchman."
Sheriff Bosquit felt positive until Berue
reported here that only two of the out
laws had rifles. It was bad news to learn
the contrary. The supplies the convicts
took with them are sufficient to last them
for a week. Previously they have had to
call at houses every day or two to get
food.

After the marriage Mrs. Barlow noticed

President F. A. Hyde, -with E. Couftney
Ford and some friends, started for the

heavily laden car gained momentum as it
descended thÂ« rough road until it struck
a deep hole. The shock' broke the spring
on the right side of the car, which went
bumping from side to side of the road at

the car ran to the foo^ of the hill and
came to rest after traveling a Ions dis
tance alons the level. The ladles had
been screaming during the wild ride and
at the end of it Mrs. Griffith was in hys

more tragic ending may be accounted a
most fortunate circumstance.
F. Xelson and wife arrived at Del Monte
to-day, having made a rapid trip through
from Oakland in one day. In the after
noon the car went over the Seventeen

A NUMBER of gentlemen recently assembled at
Denver announced themselves to the press as
representatives of the two factions of the
Populist party and proceeded to hold a convention
and discuss the situation. The outcome of the disr
cussion was, as might have been expected, the
achievement of another merger; the contending fac
tions harmonized and amalgamated. They then in
due form adopted a declaration of principles, ap
pointed a committee to attend to future business and
adjourned.
Just what is meant by this revival of the ancient
and honorable order of Populists is not clear. The
committee is headed by William V. Allen, who was
once a United States Senator and who doubtless has
a little ax to grind. Perhaps the other members of
the convention have an equal interest, or at least
hope, in the expected resurrection of the defunct or
ganization. At any rate they speak bravely. In
their platform they announce that there is no chance
for "the enactment of our truth through either the
Democratic or the Republican parties," and go on
to say: "The time is now at hand when the united
People's party should â¢ declare itself emphatically
opposed to any affiliation with either of those parties,
and unqualifiedly in favor of national political action."
The principles which make up "our truth" are thus
set forth: "Our fundamental principles are known to
all Populists and are nowhere better stated than in
that immortal document enunciated at. Omaha July
4, 1808. However, for the benefit of the uninformed
we declare our unyielding adherence to the demands
for (a) a money, whether stamped on gold, silver or
paper, to be coined and issued exclusively by the
Government and made a, full legal tender for all
debts, both public and private; (b) a system of
transportation and the transmission of intelligence
only by the public and operated by the Government
at the cost of service; (c) land for use rather than for
speculation and abolition of alien ownership of lands;
(d) American ships for American foreign commerce
without a cent of subsidy, And as an open door for
all economic reforms we urge the rule of \he people
through .the optional referendum and initiative and
the recall of derelict officials."
The reappearance of such a platform at this time
will come to most Americans like a voice from the
tombs, and there will be no little curiosity to see how
many of the old-time stalwarts of the party will rise
at the summons. When Owen Glendower boasted,
"I can call spirits from the vasty deep," Hotspur
Percy mockingly answered. "So can I. and so can

PERSONAL MEtNTION.
Fortunately for the United State*, a
check can be placed at any time on the
great quantity of valuable Illuminating oil
which Is exported from this country to
Europe, and* thin can be added to our
home consumption with the Increasing
popularity of oil. In 1901 S17.373.844 gallons
of kerosene, worth more than J32.0OO.00O,
went abroad In competition with Rus
sian oil. for while we produced only forty
two per cent of the world's total of crude
oil, we made sixty per cent of the kero
sene, and Russia produced less than half
as much, her principal product being oil
for fuel purposes.
At present the common practice is to
distill all the fine quality kerosene from,
crude oil and to subject the rest to long.
slow heating, by which the heavy oils aro
cracked up into low grade kerosene, until
three-fourths of the crude has cone into
burning oils, but if this were the practice
with all the oils produced in the United
States, many of the high class lubricating
oils would not be made at all and vase
line and other valuable by-products would
not exist.
Again, the trade adopted new and ap
proved methods only when found neces

could be placed clearly before the public
it would be more remarkable than its
treatment of competitors. The methods
of refining oil which have been used since
the discovery of petroleum, and are used
to-day, are rule-of-thumb methods, which
are a reproach to the scientific and inven
tive reputation of the United States.
It must be admitted that the Sandard
Oil refineries have obtained from petro
leum the largest percentage possible of oil
which can be burned In a lamp, and this
has been done at the sacrifice of quality
with the lowering of price. The doctrine
of "letting well enough alone" has been
carried to a dangerous extreme. But it
must be understood that of all the oil de
posits of the world none can equal the oil
of Pennsylvania for yielding fine illumin
ating oil. If such poor methods as char
acterize the American plan were employed
in Russia the resulting oil would not be
fit to burn in a lamp.
The trade has been dominated by men
far-sighted In business methods and poor
in technical ability. But a change in
these methods is being brought about by
the necessity for better work in reflnins
the oil from Texas. As predicted by the
writer a year ago, this oil would be re
fined profitably by means then to be dis
covered. The Introduction of methods
capable of refining Texas oil will enable
these methods to Â«xtend to the general
industry, and within a few years we may
expect more rational refining methods.
The great gain to be effected by such
methods Is the less wasteful use of our
natural supply and the production of tho
largest quantity of the very best products
which the crude oil will afford. Examples
of what can be done in this way can be
readily seen In the new methods of Im
proving natural asphalt and petroleum,
asphaltlc residues by heating with sul
phur or with air currents, and attention
should also be directed to the Innovations
In refining oils by distillation with air

MINERAL EXPERT WHO DIS
CUSSES THE OIL SUPPLY
QUESTION'.
A CERTAIN tendency in business is developing
throughout the country". It began to show it
self some months ago, and its existence was at
that time hinted at, but it is only quite recently
that it has become manifest and last week it became
pronounced. This drift in trade is like the turn of a
tide, slight at first and subsequently becoming
marked. It is a general downward tendency in prices.
It can be seen anywhere by those who are accus
tomed to peer closely into things around them. Tak
ing the country as a whole, or a community even,
retail prices are somewhat below those of a year or
two ago. Higher-priced goods are selling more
slowly, while the medium grades are meeting with
more demand. The labels on goods in the shop win
dows are telling their mute story to those who re
member how those same labels looked two or three
years ago. The economical man, the close buyer, is
the first to perceive the difference between now and
then. He cannot remember any particular date when
he first noticed the change, for it has crept into trade
so gradually that it has been unnoticed. But it has
got here just the same. It has now become evident
in the large wholesale trade, and we are briefly in
formed by one of the well-known commercial author
ities that "staple prices are drifting lower. Food
products certainly tend lower."
There is nothing startling about this. Everybody
has been expecting and predicting it for several
years. For a time we were on the crest of a great
wave of prosperity, to employ a phrase which has
become familiar to every American, and we all knew
that some time or other business would quiet down.
We knew, too. that inflated prices could not last, and
we also realized that it was not good for the com
mercial or social welfare that they should. Profusion
is a dangerous condition. So is high living. But we
like both, for such is man. Bread and water is a fine
healthy diet, but we do not like it.
A glance at the condition of the important staples
will show this trend in values better than penitential
moralizing. In the first place, whereas for some
years the iron and steel trades would not, and indeed
could not. promise speedy filling of orders, and often
flatly refused to accept any more new business, they
now want to make their deliveries promptly and get
their money. Still, the trade is by no means dull,
and many mills have their order books filled for
months ahead. But the rush and fever are over.
Provisions, too, as already mentioned, arc slowly set
tling, with the large Western packers less eager to
hold up the market. Buyers of cotton goods are
holding off for more harmony between the quotations
for the raw product and the manufactured goods. The
woolen goods trade is reporting a quiet market, though
there are plenty of buyers in the market and the raw
wool is quoted firm and passing rapidly from grow
ers to mill purchasers. The* New England footwear
factories are reporting a very good business in their
line, though hides and leather have become weaker
during the past month or so, and every few days a
fraction is lopped off the quotations for hides. Lum
ber is still active in the West, but is quieter in the
East, and a number of sections report a decline in
prices.
Financial considerations are said to be affecting
building operations somewhat along the Atlantic
coast. In fact, the East seems to be lagging behind
the West in commercial activity, the latter section re
porting the demand for general merchandise good,
with the movement practically as active as last year at
this time. Increasing complaints of a scarcity of cars is
a gratifying sign in this direction, while an increase
of 14 per cent in railway earnings in July over the
same month last year accentuates this condition.
But the general reports from the farms are less fa
vorable, as prices for live stock are slowly shrinking,
and the sire of the crops has diminished somewhat of
bte. Prices of commodities of all descriptions declined
i. 5 per cent in July, and have been declining almost
imperceptibly for months. Still, jobbers as a rule re
port a good inquiry for fall merchandise, and there
is no real dullness reported anywhere. The country's
bank clearings lost 3.8 per cent last week, as against
the same week last year. The failures were 178,
against 196 in 1902, but one of them was large.
Liquidation still continues in Wall street, and
though, as already mentioned, good stocks are now
deemed low enough to buy, the public arc not taking
hold of them. In fact, speculation in everything is
perceptibly quieter throughout the, country.
Conditions in California remain about the same as
before. Business is good, money is abundant, farm
products arc generally high and the export, whole
sale and retail branches of trade are reported in ex
cellent condition. We have no cause for complaint
out on ibis coast
PRICES GRADUALLY SETTLING.
Another line of interest to the oil trade,
and one of far greater significance, Is the
slow but Inevitable revolution in methods
of using crude oil. If the peculiar meth
ods maintained by the Standard Oil Com
pany In the technical treatment of crude
oil, in converting it into refined products,
CBITICISM OE METHODS.
This Is the most significant development
of the whole oil industry. Oil is more
popular than It used to be. Its two great
uses, illumination and lubrication, are
taking more and more oil, but In the
meantime the minor uses are demanding
greater supplies, and the popularity of
the by-products of petroleum Is giving
them a demand which will be satisfied
with nothing else.
One of the by-products, paraffin wax.
follows very closely, however, the price of
rival products. Thus the recent Increase
in the nrlce of paraffin wax can be traced
quite directly to me increased price of
tallow, due in turn to the manipulation
of the beef trade.
We can sum up the situation as to pe
troleum exhaustion, therefore, with an
outlook for merely a slow Increase in the
price of the raw materials, due not so
much to a lack of supply as to increased
use of the products, but the industry will
proceed with a steadiness which has char
acterized few other lines of trade.
This stability of the petroleum Indus
try has been the most remarkable feature
of our Industrial deveiopmenc. The prices
as made by the Standa. i Oil monopoly
for petroleum products have been gov
erned by the keenest and most far-seeing
consideration of supply and demand. This
tribute to keen management and the bet
terment of the condition of tha petroleum
trade on the part of the oil monopoly
must be kept in mind, as against the his
torical ruin wrought to rival refineries In
the early days. The main point of interest
to the trade In this regard Is that they
know Just what they can expect from the
Standard Company, and that sensational
discoveries of new territory will not be
allowed by the monopoly to affect the oil
trade to the slightest extent. We can
look with the utmost complacency on
the discovery of new fields In Alaska or
Texas or China "or,, on the other hand,
upon the exhaustion of considerable
fields in this country and elsewhere with
the safe assurance that the oil trade will
go on Just as though nothing had hap
pened.
GROWING USE OF ,011*
It is safe to use oil in place of coal when
the price in cents per gallon equals the
price of coal per ton in dollars. Ten-cent
oil equals ten-dollar coal.
The various advantages and disadvan
tages attending the substitution of coal
by petroleum have come to be- so well
known that it is purely a matter of small
difference In cost between coal and oil
by which the amount of petroleum used
will be regulated. But the general ten
dency is to use more oil where other fuels
have been used heretofore.
At the present time the greatest interest
in oil circles centers in Alaska, where. If
one wishes to indulge in reasonable
prophecy, we may look for an oil supply
very likely equal to that of Pennsylvania.
This .means much more for. the Pacific
Coast than It does to the oil trade.
Enough oil has been found on the Pacific
Coast to make its general use popular as
a fuel supply. Its cost relative to coal has
been well defined.
But it costs more money to produce oil
in the Western country, and especially to
refine and distribute it. Therefore, the
probable slow decline in the East means
a gradual but sure increase In the price
Of crude oil, and while large discoveries
of new oil fields will undoubtedly be made,
it is extremely questionable whether any
of them will materially disturb this grad
ually rising tendency of the price of crude
cil.
sary additional energy is given to drilling
in other promising territory until the
shortage is made up.
It is evident that Pennsylvania, Ohio
and West Virginia can furnish a large
supply of oil for years and it is further
evident that the fields in the West, espe
cially In Kansas and Indian Territory.
Wyoming and Colorado, will be drawn on
more and more to supply the 'Eastern
shortage.

The issue is not a new one. The promotion of
American shipping has been under consideration a
long time and the policy has been approved again
and again by the Republican party in its national
platforms and by the people in their support of Presi
dential candidates pledged to such platforms. To
men who are interested in transportation problems
the issue has long been one of high interest and
many of them have s,poken of it as a matter of para
mount importance.
In an address delivered in 1900 before the National
Association of Merchants and Travelers at Chicago,
Mr. J. C. Stubbs pointed out in a striking way the
contrast between the care with which we have pro
tected our industries on land and the carelessness
with which we have neglected the needs of our ocean
industries. In the course of his address he said:
"Using the figures of Mr. Secretary Gage, manufac
turing industries have been nurtured by the Gov
ernment's protecting hand until they have increased
since 1870: the cotton industry by 324 per cent, the
silk industry by 1825 per cent, the rubber industry by
431 per cent, the iron industry by 607 per cent, the
steel industry by 12,893 P" cent, while as a coal pro
ducer we now rival Great Britain. During the same
period our foreign commerce has increased in a
greater ratio than our population. Exports Of manu
factures have ~ quadrupled . and of agriculture have
trebled. From that pleasing picture one cannot but
turn with disappointment and chagrin to this one,
that between 1870 and 1899, the proportion of foreign
commerce carried in American vessels fell from 35
per cent to 8.9 per cent, to less than half what it was
in the first year of our national existence. Disagree
able as this result is, an examination into the his
toric processes by which it has been accomplished
wfll serve only to make it more displeasing, even to
humiliating our national pride."
We need not follow Mr. Stubbs in his review of the
history of the decline of oyr ocean shipping. Suffice
it. to say that we have now reached a point where we
pay a vast yearly tribute to foreign shipowners and
still do not receive from them the full service which
we could obtain from % an adequate merchant marine
of our own. Our commercial rivals, Great Britain
and Germany, carefully protect and promote their
ocean going ships. They are aware that a merchant
ship not only carries goods to existing foreign mar
kets, but serves at the same time to make new mar
kets and to advertise the trade of the country whose
flag it flies. By neglecting our ocean merchant
marine we are, therefore, not only paying heavy
tribute to our rivals, but are surrendering to them
many markets in which we might find consumers for
large quantities of American goods.
. The people have a right to expect Congress to
take action at the coming regular session in the direc
tion of promoting our merchant marine. Ample dis
cussion has been held upon various plans proposed
to that end, and it is now time for some well con
sidered policy to be adopted and provided for. We
have been paying tribute too long. Congress should
keep the promise of the Philadelphia platform of 1000.
by enacting "legislation which will enable us to re
cover our former place among the trade-carrying
fleets of the world."
ONE of the gratifying signs of the times is the
increasing public interest in our foreign com
merce, and particularly in that phase of it
which affects the question of the enactment of legis
lation designed to promote our merchant marine on
the deep seas. It has now become quite evident to
even the most casual observer that our export and
import trade can no longer be safely or economically
left to the control of foreign shipowners. We must
provi'de an American ocean transportation for Ameri
can trade, or else we shall either have to pay an
enormously increased tribute to foreigners, or see our
foreign commerce stop where it is, making little or
no advance with the advancement of the nation in
other respects.
A NEGLECTED DUTY
Managers of these oil pools are able, by
the distribution of the wells they drill, to
rather carefully determine what may be
expected from each district and as fast
as the signs of exhaustion make it neces-
ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
LARGE SUPPLY FOR YEARS.
Even the writer went into print to in
dulge in some pleasant anticipation of a
long supply of oil in considerable abund
ance from the Beaumont regionâ an an
ticipation more optimistic than can be re
alized. Nevertheless, the general prob
ability then expressed remains true to
day, that 'Other fields In Texas will un
doubtedly yield many times as much oil
us has been found at Beaumont and, un
der conditions of conservative production,
with more remunerative prices.
It Is Interesting to note that Texas pe
tioleum has had no influence at any time
on the general market price for crude oil
over. the world. Its effect was simply
local. The oil did not enter into com
petition with the general supply from
Pennsylvania. West Virginia and Ohio,
from which States the steady supply Is
obtained. The condition in these States
may be summed up as follows:
The oil districts in Pennsylvania have
proved longer lived than was anticipated.
When, under conditions of large produc
tion, stocks of oil accumulated, many in
dividual pools in Pennsylvania were con
sidered exhausted, because the great sup
ply was gone, and It cost as much as it
came to for pumping the oil. Following
the resulting decrease in supply the price
advanced sufficiently to reopen these old
pools and the economy of pumping sev
eral wells with one engine allowed them
to come to life again with moderate
profit.
Meanwhile the discovery of news pools
has been frequent and satisfactory. In
fact, the oil discoveries of Southwestern
Pennsylvania and West Virginia, together
with the â¢ Ohio supply, have more than
offset the decline from abandoned pools.
At present popular anxiety as to> the
petroleum supply is due to disappointment
concerning the Beaumont field In Texas.
Fifteen months ago optimistic writers
v:ere predicting a petroleum deluge from
Beaumont, and the expectation of enor
mous yields was heightened by the anx
iety of speculative Investors to market
their oil at any price. This resulted in
oil being sold as low as 3 cents per bar
rel, and yet that oil has increased over a
hundred fold in value in the course of
twelve months, as the supply has gone to
a low ebb.
PENNSYLVANIA DISTRICTS.
USE OF COAL AND OIL.
Producing and refining petroleum con
stitutes the most interesting mineral in
dustry in the United States at the pres
ent time. It is more interesting than the
coal supply^ Coal Is merely a source of
heat, whereas petroleum contributes to
many industries. For some of these in
dustries it is absolutely essential that pe
troleum should be produced In large
quantities and at a low price. Petroleum
production has been . more sensational
than usual during the last few years, al
though its history has been filled with
sensations since its discovery in consider
able quantity in 1859.
Again, there is no industry In the coun
try so beset with misconceptions as to
its condition as the petroleum trade.
Most of these arise from the ever present
menace of a quick failure of the supply.
Such failures have been prophesied for
nearly half a century and yet the pro
duct is greater than ever in this country,
and, besides, it has been exceeded in
some years by the enormous product of
Russia.
In industries like coal mining, and, in
fact, in every mining industry except pe
troleum, we can see and measure the min
eral in the ground, whereas we can gauge
the petroleum supply only by the tiny
streams laboriously pumped from some
mysterious source a I thousand or more
feet below the surface of the earth. For
this reason petroleum exhaustion will
continue to give more or less anxiety to
the popular mind in spite of recent addi
tions of petroleum bearing territory in
the United States, and especially in Alas
ka, significant new supplies in Roumanla,
Russia, Japan, India, South America and
â most significant of all â China.
It must be perfectly evident that this
anxiety as to petroleum exhaustion In the
mind of the general public does not affect
the petroleum trade, otherwise there
would be aulck and wide variations in
the market price with the exhaustion of
each pool and the discovery of each new
district.
Chief of Division of Mineral Resources, United
States Geological Survey.
IN considering the condition of the pe
troleum Industry of the United States
it ia necessary to fix the point of view
by a few plain facts as to its present
condition.
During! the calendar year 1902 the
United States produced 80,894,500 barrels
of petroleum, worth, delivered into the
pipe line's, $69,610,348. This is the greatest
product we have ever produced, and it
is probably slightly greater than Russia's
product during the same period and
enormously greater than the entire pro
duct of the rest of the world.
By far the greater part of this petro
leum came from old, well-known sources
of supply, which yield the best varieties
of petroleum known in the world, and
which, . by the methods of refining In
vogue for many years, is made into illum
inating oh, good, bad and indifferent, to
the extent of seventy-five per cent of the
crude. No other petroleum in the world
yields nearly as much illuminating oil as
American petroleum.
The methods by which this crude yield
is accomplished are old-fashioned and
complex, but efficient for the purposes.
Some oils, refined by European methods,
would yield half as much illuminating oil
as they do, but it. would be a far better
quality than part of our product and not
so good as our best.
BY DB. DAVID T. DAY,
San Francisco is watching in pleasant anticipation
the merry clash of authority and the loud crimination
and recrimination of the various municipal depart
ments of the city. If the row continues it is reason
able to expect that taxpayers will learn much to their
advantage. .It is always something of an encourage
ment to learn what becomes of public money.
to the nominating convention who will place a ticket
in the field worthy of the support of public spirited
men. That expectation should not be disappointed.
Every loyal Republican should go to the primaries
to-morrow resolved to vote for good men and for
none other, in order to assure the double object of
party success and public welfare.
The one danger to be feared is that of political
apathy on the part of a large percentage of the Re
publican voters. It is a danger that is always im
minent. Experience has shown again and again that
the most serious evil in American municipal life is
the disinclination of large numbers of workingmen,
professional men and business men to perform
their political duties. The danger is well known. It
has been pointed out by the press, by students of our
politics, by pulpit orators and in the course of aca
demic addresses at our universities. It is well under
stood even by the apathetic themselves, and the issue
of to-day is that of trying to overcome it and so
bring out a full vote at the primaries to-morrow.
In this particular case there are special reasons why
every taxpayer should be more than usually interested
and active in the contest. It is quite probable that in
the coming bond elections there will be voted large
sums of money for extraordinary purposes. The pos
sibility of having control of the expenditure of that
money, and of directing the works of public improve
ment, will of course excite keenly the greed and the
ambitions of the bosses and their gangs. The leaders
of the spoilsmen are going to make every effort to
procure the nomination of men who will in office be
subservient to the spoils system. Their schemes can
be baffled only by the activity of the great mass of
good citizens, and accordingly every man who has a
genuine patriotic desire for good government ought
to make it a point to take part in the primaries this
year and do his full duty toward the community.
In the Republican camp the issue is plain. By the
United Republican League there has been put into
the field in every district a ticket of proposed dele
gates who deserve the support of their fellow citizens.
The delegates proposed by the league are unpledged
to any faction, or to any man, or set of men. They
are opposed in several instances by the candidates
of notorious bosses. The defeat of any one of them
would mean a loss to the convention of an indepen
dent, upright man, with the probable substitution in
his place of a man who as a delegate would have no
other aim than that of promoting the cause of the
bosses and the success of the spoils politicians.
Therefore there will come before the rank and file
of the Republican party to-morrow the clear and un
mistakable issue whether they will vote with the
United Republican League in its efforts for good
government, or will neglect a grave political and
civic duty and leave the election to go by their de
fault to the bosses.
s~-*y ONCERNING the importance of the primary
I. elections of to-morrow it is hardly necessary
"^ to say anything to intelligent citizens. It is
well known that upon these elections depends the
character of the coming administration of municipal
offices. The selection to-morrow of good delegates
to the various cenventions will assure the nomination
of right men for the many offices that are to be filled;
and if such men be nominated, then on election day
every voter will have the satisfaction of ample choice
in making up his ballot for municipal and county
officers. If, on the other hand, boss controlled dele
gates be chosen, then the convention will do the bid
ing of the bosses, and among the candidates nomi
nated the voter will have only a choice of evils.
Public opinion at this time expects a substantial,
if not a sweeping, victory for the candidates of the
Republican party. A good nominating convention
will go far toward making that expectation a cer
tainty. Consequently the main interest in the con
test to-morrow centers on the Republican primaries.
It is to the rank and file of the Republican party that
independent voters look for the selection of delegates
skepticism the public will wait to see what response
is to be made by the spirits of bygone Populism to
this new call of the job-chasers.

by Bishop Nichols In 1S90. In 1S93 he was
ordained priest by Bishop Nicholson of
Milwaukee and succeeded to the charge
of the Church of the Redeemer,
Superior, Wls., where he remained
for several years. In 1895 he was
called to Grace Cathedral at Indianapolis,
remaining In charge until 1897, when he
accepted a call to Galesburg. He Is
known as high church, though not an ex
tremist, and will continue the methods
at old St John's that were Introduced
by Father Ray. Mr. Gee Is young In
years and said to be eloquent and tactful.

tendencies. Propped by Jackscrews, it
stands several feet above Its former level,
while the workmen are laying a concrete
foundation upon which the entire edifice
will hereafter rest. This will give a sub
stantial character to the structure, which
it has heretofore lacked, and enable it to
withstand ordinary , earthquake shocks
without damage. Some $5000 will be ex
pended on Interior readjustment, which
will add a whole story and give room In
the basement for bowling ., alleys, gymna
sium, blllard rooms and apartments for
the many guilds connected with the mis
sion. The present hall will be consider
ably enlarged and the jj dispensary ' and
hospital, now In the upper floor, will be
given larger space In the main story.

BAKERSFIEL.D. Aug. 9.â A large
fire started two days ago is sweeping
over the mountains south of Caliente.
thirty miles south of Bakersfleld. The
blaze has already swept over thousands
of acres cf land, destroying the grass on
the ranges and large fields of grain and
forests. To-day the flre destroyed many
dollars' worth of grain and crops on the
ranch of W. R. Rankin, near Caliente, and
from here It has spread to the property
ot the Kern County Land Company, and
to-night the fields and trees are blazing,
the flames shooting upward, forming a
magnificent sight, plainly seen from the
railroad and the town of Caliente.
To-night a special train left Kern City
carrying a large force of men sent by the
land company to protect its property and
arrest the progress of the all-devouring
flames which have leaped across roads
and ditches and are now In the land com
pany's large grain fields. Some fear Is ex
pressed for the safety of ranch houses In
the mountains and there is even a chance
of the fire reaching the town of Caliente.
The latter town is a small but very Im
portant station on the Southern Pacific
and Santa Fe. where freight is unloaded
for the great Huntlngton-Hellman Power
plant at Kernvllle. The railroad company
has Its section crew on watch there and
in making preparation* to ward off the
blaze should it approach the town or its
property.

By order cf Archbishop Riordan sol
emn high mass was celebrated yes
terday In all churches under his ju
risdiction, this in honor of St. Emyg
dius and to Invoke his intercession to
guard against earthquakes. St. Emyg
dius is the patron saint to shield the
faithful from earthquakes.
The solemn high mass at St. Mary's
Cathedral was especially inspiring at 11
o'clock. All the somber draperies in
honor of the memory of the late Pope
had been removed and the church was
bright again. Mass was celebrated by
the Rev. Father W. J. Sullivan, who was
assisted by the Rev. Fathers Hannlgan
and Rarnm, who were respectively deacon
and sub-deacon. The Rev. Father O'Ryan
acted as master of ceremonies. The cele
brant and deacons were robed in crim
son chasubles, while seated in the sacris
ty was Archbishop Montgomery, robed In
purple vestments. The choir music waa
rendered with spirit and beauty.
The sermon was preached by the Very
Rev. Prendergrast. By way of Instruc
tion he said:
To those who do not know. It should be said
that St. Emygdius lived 1600 yean ago in
pagan Rome. He was born In a small town
on the banks of the river Rhine, in Germany.
Long; before he became of age he adopted Chris
tianity, much agalm<t his parents' wishes, for
they were pagans. When Quite a young man
he went to Rome and tendered his services as a
Christian to the Pope in the propagation of
Christianity. His services were accepted, and
en account of his performing miracles he was
Koon locked upon as a god by the pagans in
Rome. He was later sent out as a bishop to a
country on the archipelago near Greece. Enter
ing a temple filled with pagans who were lame,
blind and halt, he healed them by making the
sign of the cross over them. After he had ac
complished this miracle he walked up to the
altar in the temple and destroyed all the gods
and irr.aees. In that temple alone he con
verted 1300 pagans.
The prefect of the district became very ieal
ous of Â£t. Emygdlu*. and, sending for him,
attempted to persuade him to discard Chris
tianity. But the saint stood firm, and he was
later beheaded by this very Governor of the
province.
St. Emygdius, among other miracle*, was
called upon many times to quell earthquakes.
He is looked upon as the patron saint to
protect the faithful from earthquakes, and It
it. in his honor that the mass is celebrated to
day.

CORBETT SEEKS SECLUSION".
Leaves His Training Quarters to
Avoid the Sunday Throng.
With the object of escaping the ques
tions, advice and gaze of several hundred
persons who wended their way to his
training quarters at Croll's Gardens, Ala
meda, yesterday, James J. Corbett took
refuge in a secluded place, where his ad
mirers and others who wanted to "get a
line" on the big boxer could not discover
him. Of late Jim has been pestered with
sports of all degrees, from the piker to
the plunger, who are looking for inside
"dope" on the coming fistic champion
ship battle. Others there are who stand
ready at all times to inform Corbett of
the weaknesses of Jeffries and of the only
sure way of fighting the swarthy boiler
maker. These wiseacres have taken vari
ous courses in forwarding their advice to
Corbett. Some of them have written to
the actor-boxer, others have called him
up on the telephone, others have at
tracted his attention for a moment and
have then taken him asdde to whisper
tactics to the man who has won and lost
the championship and who is bent on re
gaining it again. Corbett and his coach
ers expected yesterday the rush to Croll's
Gardens would be extra heavy, as it was
the last Sunday before thÂ© fight. Their
expectations were realized. During the
day hundreds of young men and old men,
and ladles also went to the ex-cham
pion's training quarters, and all asked,
"Where is Corbett?"* They were told that
Jim bad gone out somewhere and would
not be around for the day. Corbett took
to the roads for easy sprints, but man
aged to keep out of sight of the throng
that wanted to see him at his camp.
During the .afternoon Frankie Nell, who
fights Harry Forbes Thursday night and
who is preparing himself at Croll's Gar
dens, boxed three rounds with Danny Sul
livan. The boys went at it with vigor in
the two final rounds and Nell gave every
Indication that he was In condition to
withstand a hard battle.
LISBON Aug. 9. â A violent earthquake
shook Lisbon and vicinity at 10 o'clock to-night.
The duration of the ehock was two minutes. It
produced a great panic and some damage, but
no fatalities have been reported.
While the latter professes great respect
for the prowess and skill of Corbett and
has advised friends East not to try to
guess the number of rounds the fight will
last. Jeff himself evidently figures it will
be a sharp, short battle. As evidence of
the fact that the champion's pile-driver
blows leave their effect, no matter wh*re
they land. Jack Jeffries was dazed the
other morning by a straight left which
caught him. on the crown of the head
while he was ducking blows. The same
morning big Joe Kennedy had one of his
shoulders temporarily desabled by a left
swing. Jeff Is naturally a southpaw, and
when he swings that left on the point it
generally scores a "strike." It is then
usually a case of "set 'em up in the other
alley."
Joe (Kid) Eagan and Mrs. Delaney
left here by today's stage. All arrange
ments have been made for the champion's
departure for Oakland on Wednesday
next, as before stated in these columns.
F. E. MULHOLLAND.
The only care of Billy Delanev from
now on until the nlcht of the big con
test will be to watch Jeff and see that no
accident befalls the chamDion. The big
fellow is the most unconcerned man here
and would just as soon crack walnuts on
a can of nitro-glycerine or do a sand shuf
fle in one of the powder magazines at
Vallejo so oblivious is he to fear. These
careless traits of Jeff are causing- deep
furrows to form in Jthe otherwise placid
features of Delaney. ..
HARBIN SPRINGS, Aug. 9,-Friday
was practically another day of inactiv
ity in the Jeffries camp. For that matter
the champion will indulge in no mere hard
work. He is satisfied with his condition
and so is Manager Billy Delanev.
Jeff logged down to Mlddletown and
back on Friday morning, after which he
simply killed time until evening. Then
he comprised one of a party of sixteen
that sat down to an impromptu banquet
arranged by John Marcovich, a close
friiand and heavy backer of Jeffries, to
celebrate the eighth wedding anniversary
of the former's marriage.
It came near being a stag party, for
besides Mrs. Marcovich, Mrs. Delaneyv
wife of Billy Delaney, was the only other
lady present. For this mountainous
region the menu reflected much credit on
the spring's chef, and the table finishers
quartet, Messrs. Mike Hallaban. Joe
Kennedy, Joe (Kid) Eagan and Jack Jef
fries, did' ample justice to the repast. Jim
Jeffries acted as master of ceremonies,
assisted by Proprietor Jim Hayes. Judge"
Qulnn of Emeryville, although a bachelor,
In a cleverly worded speech spoke know
ingly of the ecstatic bliss of wedded life,
and finally all tipped glasses to the toast,
"Long life and happiness to the host and
hostess." "Kid" Eagan gave Imitations of
Bobby Gaylor. and Joe Kennedy made a
hit by shouldering a broom and going
through the manual of arms as Interpreted
by Michael Joseph Conboy. Billy Delano
rendered a Scotch ballad with feeling and
sympathy; Mike Hallahan joined with a
smart talk on "Internal Disturbances of
the Stomach and their Causes" and Billy
Lyons closed with an original poem, "My
Wild Ride to Reno."

Cloverdale, which waB thought to have
the stake at his mercy, was beaten by
Eagle in the fourth 'round in a flukey
course. Cloverdale was a 1 to 8 favor
ite.
Tillie R and. Ragged Actor were run
ning at the time of the accident. They
were sent back to slips and ranthAr trial
a second time. Judge P. J. ReUly was
among the spectators and was pressed
into service in the saddle. His decisions
gave satisfaction.
Hounds from James Sweeney's kennel
captured both stakes. The open event
went to Rubber Ankles, which beat Rec
tor in the deciding course by a score of 14
to 0. Rector was a 4 to 5 favorite. In the
semi-final rounds Lord Brazen was made
a 1 to 3 favorite over Rubber Ankles.
The latter beat him by a score of 3 to 0.
He fell as if shot and Judge Grace was
thrown under him. not having time to
make a move to save himself. Neither
horse nor man moved a muscle and the
horrified SDectators thought both had
been killed. A number of men, ran to the
assistance of Judge Grace and had to lift
the horse off his body. He was at once
removed to his home, whefe Dr. i^eonard
found he had broken his collar bone and
had the ribs crushed on his left side. It
will be three days before the full extent
of his injuries can be determined.
Judge Grace has judged fully 100,000
courses, covering a period of thirty years.
In all this desperate riding over all kinds

Each time it was by his favorite horse
which he has ridden during the past four
years.

Wheeler, at this Juncture, landed flush
on the solar plexus of a slow curve and
nway it soared to center field, with Cor
bett and Toman on a mad chase to the
plate, where they both arrived in safety.
Then Smith tried the chop Btunt to
Francks. Buck fumbled ence more and
Hoy came in during the uproar and the
mixup which followed this second error.
The score:
Los Angele* â f Oakland â
In the third fpasm, a run came home
for the visitors. Spies was passed and
Crbett let loose a double to left field.
Hoy hit to Baxter, who fumbled the ball,
allowing Spies to register. Smith shoved
a slow one past Messerly and Corbett
landed. During the next round. Cravath
found Cooper for a solid double to right
and Tomaa resnonded with a sinde to
Fhort center field. Toman started to steal
and Peter Lnhman threw badly to second,
so Cravath had little trouble in reaching
lhr> P9S3.
The Anpels came through with the real
hig- pet-away in the seventh spasm. Cra
vath was passed and Toman again fol
lowed with TjIs little hit to center. Spies
was retired easily, but Corbett got four
balls and the bags could hold no more.
Hoy chopped in the direction of short and
FYaneks booted the ball. Cravath scoring.
Cooper was not h'.mself apparently. The
Angels managed to get to him in bunches
of a few at a time, and just at the right
time generally. Then he issued a pass
occasionally, and several of the?e result
ed in runs. Cooper's pitching was great
when compared with the support accord-
M him. Errors always happened when
men were on the sacks and let in most
of the runs.
Brother Joe allowed the Cripples five
scattered hits. In no inning did he let
them bunch more than one at a time 6a ve
in the fifth.. Then they squeezed two in
on him, but they counted no more than
1f not a one was scored. walked a
pair of Cripples in the opening round,
hut after that refused to be worked by
any mere batters.
Joe Corbett is the man who was always
in the way and ready to block the pro
jrress of the Cripples in their vain at
tempts to reach the rubber in the after
neon game. He had a good day and
pitched ball that would -have won glory
for him upon any ball field in the coun
try. He received support that could not
heve been made to order and fitted the
occasion as well.
The Angels performed well In both bat
tlesâso well that the Cripples scored but
a paltry run in a total of eighteen full
innings of play. The hitting for the day
was lipht. but the fielding of the Angels
â¢was bright enough to offset the den
cie-r.cy.
Morley'a collection of Angels performed
their last week's work well at Recreation
l'ark. and with light hearts they will
have for Sacramento to-day. They de-
Jrated the Cripples twice yesterday and
gave them a beating which left little con
eolation for the vanquished. At Oakland
the score happened 5 to 1. The afternoon
result "was even more liu ml lla tingâ 7 to 0.

STANDING OF TUB CLUBS,
Xo one takes seriously the story that
George Smith (Plttsburg Phil) will leave
the turf. Instead of quitting it is known
that he is attempting to have his rights
As. an owner of thoroughbreds restored to
him. There will be a meeting of the stew
ards of the Jockey Club this week, at
which Smith's application for reinstate
ment will be considered. The stories of
his sensational winnings yesterday on
Hermis and Aristrocracy were in no way
exaggerated. The lowest estimate of the
amount of his winnings on Aristrocracy
placed the sum at $40,000. "Phil" himself
merely says that he won his largest
wager of the last five years.
The disqualification of Hermis yesterday
after he had scored a hollow victory in
the first race and the giving of 'the purse
to Major Dalngerflcld has caused much
comment. It was believed that Million
aire Thomas' long string of hard luck had
at last broken, and this new misfortune
was regretted by turfgoers generally, who
want to see the enthusiastic young turf
man succeed. However, the stewards say
no other course was left open to them, as
the horse was entered In the name of the
new partnership of Thomas & Shields,
when that firm had not yet been officially
registered. The disqualification' of Her
mis did not affect his backers, as bets
were paid on the result of the race as it
was run and as announced in the ring.
The action of the stewards was not made
public until late last night.
It is reported that Chuctanunda is hope
lessly broken down, and the famous
sprinter probably has been seen in the
bands of the starter for the last time.
SARATOGA, N. Y.. Aug. 9.-Captain S.
S. Brown said to-night that he would
match his colt Broomstick against J. E.
Madden's Aristocracy, the winner of the
Saratoga Special, and would wager $10,000
to JSOOO on his colt. Inasmuch as W. C.
Whitney has always encouraged special
races this is considered a splendid chance
to bring about a renewal of the big race
of yesterday, the only objection being the
state of the track at present.
It is said that an effort will be made to
obtain permission to bridge Union avenue
and build a straightaway racetrack, so
that races of the value and importance of
tbe Saratoga Special and other rich stakes
for two-year-olds may be run without
danger of interference.
In eplte of the weather.ewhich has made
the Saratoga track one of the worst ever
known, the present meeting is having
phenomenal success, and the play in the
betting ring is becoming remarkable for
Its recklessness. Official announcement
has been made that on the opening day
(last Monday) the J|Â»ceipts of the Sara
toga Racing Association were larger by
almost $4000 than they were on the open-
Ing day a year ago. Then on Wednesday,
in spite of the rain, the receipts exceeded
those of the third day of last year, which
was bright and pleasant, by more than
rsOO. Yesterday's attendance was a rec
ord breaker.

fighting this yard subject that we should build
a line a mile and a half long- up Parker street,

honest Judgment whether the Parker street
proposition is not immeasurably more danger

The residence of David Lane at 2460
Market street was entered Friday after
noon during the temporary absence of the
family, and jewelry to the amount of $100
was obtained. Entrance was gained by
opening the front door with a key. The
thief evidently did not spend much time
in the house and made a hurried search
for valuables.
He secured two gold watches, a silver
watch and some minor articles of jewelry.
When Mrs. Lane returned home after
two hours' absence she was surprised tft
find the bedroom In disorder and the con
tents of the' bureau scattered about the
floor. She surmised that the house had
been robbed and a further Investigation
confirmed her . suspicions. It is thought
that the visit of a neighbor during.^her
absence and the repeated knockmgs^ on
the door frightened away the thief.
The rooms of Mrs. Osgood on Seven
teenth street near Church wera entered
in a similar way on Thursday and $40 in
cash and some Jewelry were stolen.
This work was evidently done by a

The condition . of William D. Eng
lish at a late hour to-night was re
ported to be slightly more favorable,
but it was admitted by those around
him that the chances for his re
covery were slight. Dr. D. D. Crowley,
the surgeon In charge of the case, is hope
ful, but that is all. Since the operation
on Saturday Mr. English has been in a
state of collapse and everything that was
possible has had to be done in order to
tide him over the shocTc. The tempera
ture of the patient has been low; In fact,
below normal for the greater part of the
time, and it was not until this evening
that it arose to a fraction of a degree
above the average. On the other hand
the pulse has been high and has been in
the neighborhood of 140 for the greater
part of the time. This Is an indication
of low vitality and an inability on the
part of the system to rally from the
shock of the operation. This lack of vi
tality may be accounted for by age and
by the former operation, which weakened
the system to some extent Mr. English
experiences moments of consciousness,
but they are never of very long duration:
During these moments he converses with
those about him, but only the attendants
and immediate members of his family are
permitted to reach his bedside.
The hospital where Mr. English rests Is
besieged by friends of the sick man, but
the family only have Been admitted. The
best that the physicians will give out Is
the hope that the patient will survive the
usual crisis that follows such an opera
tion, and that he will last for three days.
If he passes this period they hold out a
hope for his recovery. /
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1113 Broadway, Aug. 9.
SANTA CRUZ. Aug. 9.â The Sixth Regi
ment arrived this afternoon on a special
train, which stopped In front of Camp
Dickinson, named after Major General
John H. Dickinson, and the troops
alighted and marched into camp. ThÂ«
soldiers were received by a large crowd.
The companies were Quickly assigned to
their tents, and soon afterward dinner
was served. The menu consisted of good
wholesome food, which the soldiers rel
ished, as they were all hungry. Colonel
Johnson of Stockton is in command. The
companies are all from the San Joaqula
Valley.
The Second Regiment, composed of Sac
ramento Valley companies, arrived this
evening. Colonel Seymour of Sacramento
commanding. Their camps in Dolphin*
Park, which Is called Camp Stone, after
Adjutant General Stone. Active military
instruction begins to-morrow. The camps
will be devoted strictly to military train
ing:, and the features of entertainment
prominent at camp In former years will
be missing, although at night there will
be entertainment at Dolphin Pavilion,
where a dance will be given each evening.
Visits during the week are expected from
Governor Pardee and staff. Major General
Dickinson. Brigadier Generals Warfleld
and Muller and their staffs. As each regi
ment has a band there will be plentv of
music. The citizens will give receptions
and hops in honor of the regiments.
In the second and third classes play was
completed down to the semi-finals. In the
second class the four successful players
were Georjje Janes, G. D. Russell, Nor
man Ambrose and Clarence Foley. In the
third class J. R. Lewis, Stewart Gayness,
L. D. Roberts and Fred Adams reached
the semi-finals.
For a class tournament the matches
jesterday were surprisingly one-sided.
Men In the same class are expected to be
on an equal footing with each other, but
almost every match played was won In
two short sets. The exception to the rule
was the second class match between Ed
Flnnegan and Alexander Beyfuss. Their
match was probably the longest and most
stubbornly contested ever played on the
public courts. In each of the first two
pets Beyfuss had. a big lead to overcome.
He did so In both cases, but only at the
sacrifice of his strength. Beyfuss was
more skillful than Flnnegan, but the lat
ter was possessed of better staying quali
ties and won by tiring his opponent.
The "surprise of the second class was the
defeat of Marlus Hotchkiss at the hands
of Foley. G. D. Russell, the ex-champlon
of Michigan, won his matches handily.
The ease with which he disposed of Hor
ace Mann makes his chances of winning
the class look good. If he beats Janes
he will surely win.
In the third class Stewart Gayness, who
has won the cup twice and leads in the
race, won his matches cleverly* and will
meet J. R. Lewis. Gayness lsVgain ex
pected to prove victorious, and will here
after play in the second class.
Herbert Long, who was thought to have
an excellent chance of winning the class,
was badly beaten by Fred Adams. The
latter occasionally plays a strong game,
but Is erratic. Gayness and Adams are
expected to meet In the final.
Following is the result of the day's play

Some good practice matches were played
on the California Club courts. The fea

The opening rounds of the second and
third classes of the class singles tennis
tournament, which was commenced on the
public courts in Golden Gate Park last
Sunday, were played yesterday. The
fourth class, which with the first was
Started a week ago, was completed and
resulted in a victory for Melville Long,
making his second victory.
The final match of the first class, vhich
was scheduled to be played in the after
noon, was postponed, and the spectators
were forced to watch the lower class men
strive for honors. The fog and strong
wind were the cause of postponing the
match. It will be played next Sunday.
The officers concerned In the whipping
probably will be prosecuted. Citizens
here openly say that they should be
lynched.
When Miss de Crist was convicted of

With her back mangled. Miss de Crist
was sent to the field to work with ne
groes. She fainted and was found by Su
perintendent Foster, who sent her to the
hospital and bitterly denounced the
brutality.
The disclosure* which have followed
the investigation of the whipping are the
moat shocking that have ever been pub
lished in connection with the penal his
tory of Georgia. , It appears that Miss
de Crist angered Warden Alagood's wife
by complaining about being replaced as
hospital stewardess by a negro. Mrs.
Alagood told her husband to whip Miss
de Crist.
The Warden had the woman brought In
by the guards and had her upper cloth

de Crist was held, Alagood struck her
forty times on the back with a leather
strap, nearly every stroke drawing blood.

Special Dispatch to The. Call.
We then made overtures to Hunter and he
sold us the property. It Is Into this site that
the spur track from our main line has been
operated Tor years. .To comply with the law
we asked the Trustees for a franchise. Then
and not until then, was an opposition manu
factured out of nothing and started. Effort
has been made to show that this crossing
would be a "death trap" : that property values
would be depreciated; that we were Invading a
home district. The fact is. .that -the people
who came to us eaid they would like to get
the lumber mllis out of there and would not
raise a hand to. stop us.
We agreed to move the freight yards to meet
the desires of the people of Berkeley. We are
not compelled to move them. They are on our
own property. But when the way seemed clear
for the establishment of a yard at a suitable
point we agreed not only to clear the yards
out of East Berkeley, but to Improve that loca
tion with a fine depot.
An attempt Is being made to befog the mat
ter with falsa Issues, and unfair agitation. The
Southern Pacific Company is not trying to force
freight yards down the throats of any one ln s
Berkeley. We bought the property under the
express representation that It would be an en
tirely satisfactory move to the surrounding
owners. Now, '.as a cold. matter of fact, there
are Just thirty-two houses In the forty acres
adjacent to the â¢ South Berkeley site. That
means, for example,. less than an average of oiie
house to an Oakland city blocks Some of the
protesting owners live half a mile from the
yard site. -â¢â¢ It would be much. as if a man on
Fourteenth Â¦ street, Oakland, should â¢ protest
against something done on First street.
The company, is willing to pocket its loss on
MORE LAND PURCHASED.
But so far Â«â¢Â« thÂ« agitation over thr> fran
chise Roes I am prepared to prove that the
Southern Pacific Company has not been treated
with good faith. In fact. ahsolut* bad faith
has been shown In this matter 'of the removal
of the freight yards from East Berkeley to
South Berkeley. When we were approached by
citizens of Berkeley to take the yards out of
the center of the town we agreed to move
them, and people from the very section where
the agitation has been fomented to!J us there
would be absolutely no objection If we bought
the lumber mills property.
At that time we could not purchase It be
cause <he owners gave Hunter, the lumberman
first call. He bought It and we purchased a
site on the other side of the street. Later,
however to avoid friction., we were assured
that If we could get the Hunter property all
opposition, would cease. .^-~
Division Superintendent W. S. Palmer
contributed to the controversy to-day by
making a complete explanation, from the
Southern Pacific Company's viewpoint.
Mr. Palmer declared there had been mis
representation of the railroad's position;
that the Oakland Transit people had kept
out of the fleht because they knew that
the Southern Pacific had a right of way
at the point, and that to put In the cross-
Ing meant that the Transit Company had
tired of waiting for a settlement of the
trouble. Superintendent Palmer said:
The Southern Pacific Company's position has
been distorted. AH we ever asked for was a
franchise to operate our cars over a. spur
track Into the Hunter property, which has been
laid there for ten yearn. There Is no quarrel
between the Oakland Transit people and the
company. They knew . the track was there
and have always figured on crossing the track
with their main line up Shattuck avenue.
The only reason there was delay in build
ing: the track crossing; was that we had talked
about changing the angle of our spur track,
movlnif it fifty' or sixty feet tn the event a
franchise should be granted. The street car
people have been wattlns for things to come
to a head so they would not have to tear up
their track crossing and lay a new one when
we should move the track, nut they wero
anxious to go ahead and complete their track
laying, and have therefore built a orosslrg on
the lines of the spur as It Ib laid. To-day
they started to Install the- crossing, and our
men are working with them.
That Is the situation so far as the crossing
Is concerned.
PALMER EXPLAINS.
"I don't think the Transit Company
would put in that crossing unless it knew
what it was about." he said. "There's
an understanding, all right. Well, we'll
make trouble for them, you can just bet.
There'll be a hot time in the old town
when the trustees grant that franchise."
The location of the freight yards will be
decided in two weeks, when Trustee Con
nor returns from a vacation. Three trus
teesâRyder, Connor and Rickardâ are for
removal to South Berkeley and threeâ
Ferrier, Hoff and Dowdâ against it, with
Trustee Staats undecided.
Dr. Woodson Allen of 2117 Ashby ave
nue, one of the speakers at last night's
mass meeting, looked on to-day while the
work was going on and said he thought
there was no use protesting.
But the South Berkeleyans* minds were
disabused this morning when they looked
out of their windows and saw the gang
of Oakland Transit Consolidated men lay
ing crossings in anticipation of the South
ern Pacific's coming. Then they remem
bered that through all the agitation the
Oakland Transit Consolidated had not
helped them, having let them go on mak
ing the best fight they knew how. And
finally they concluded that the Oakland
Transit Consolidated knew all the time
that the Southern Pacific wasn't going to
blockade its traffic and that there was an
understanding between the two great rail
way companies.
Frank P. Wells of 2150 Ward street is
one of those who looked out of his win
dow and saw the work going on this
morning. He Immediately suspected that
the Southern Pacific was attempting to
gain some advantage and hurried after
Street Superintendent Turner and Chief
of Police Kerns. His idea was to get. an
injunction f "against the"* corporation, but
when the officers'said it could not be done
on a Sundav he withdrew. Subsequently
he learned that it was the Oakland
Transit's doings, not the Southern Pa
cific's. .
The gore formed by the Intersection of
Adeline street and Shattuck avenue is the
very place where the Southern Pacific
Company wants to. have its new freight
yards and against which South Berkeley
ans have been protesting.
Â¦ Up to this morning the people of South
Berkeley labored under the belief that the
Southern Pacific and the Oakland Transit
Company were warring giants, clutching
at each other's throats in the struggle for
advantage. In their efforts to prevent the
Southern Pacific's yards from coming
among them the South Berkeleyans sided
with the. . Oakland Transit Consolidated.
All were agreed that the Southern Pa
cific's sole object In wanting the yards at
Adeline "street and Shattuck avenue lay
in blocking the ferry trains of the new
system. /
This conviction of the Southern Pa
cific's deep intent kept growing stronger
all the time. The Central Improvement
Club was formed, protests were made to
the Board of Trustees and meetings were
held by the angry citizens. It culminated
last night .in. a mass-meeting in Lorln
Hall, whan speeches were made by the
leaders of the protestants.
MINDS ARE DISABUSED.
While South Berkeleyans and West
Berkeleyans and East Berkeleyans have
been engaged in a three-cornered fight
over the removal of the Southern Pacific
Company's freight yards from East
Berkeley to South Berkeley that corpora
tion and the Oakland Transit Company,
which were supposed to be at loggerheads
over a matter of track crossing, have been
lying on their oars waiting developments.
That a perfect understanding as to the
real situation existed all this time was
made manifest to-day when the Oakland
Transit Company, which is preparing the
way for its new ferry train system along
Adeline street, sent a gang of men to
lay two sets of crossing tracks at the In
tersection of Adeline street and Shattuck
avenue.
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street, Aug. 9.
Besides the singing of the choir, Mrs.
John Jackson. Mrs. "William Jenkins and
Mr. Jacobs, the blind singer, rendered
sacred solos.
The temporary Hamilton Church is
16x50 feet and seats 200 people. Every part
of the edifice was crowded at each of the
three services and nine new members
joined the church during the day.
There was but one note of sadness
throughout the exercises and that was
sounded by the pastor, the Rev. Mr. Ox
nam, when he announced the serious, and.
it is feared, fatal Illness of the president
of their board of trustees, John O. Dyer,
who had generously given the first $1000
toward the purchase of the land for the
church. i
The temporary church was prettily dec
orated. A great American flag was
spread across the platform, the sides of
the church and the roof were adorned
with green boughs, at the foot of the
platform were beautiful flowers and the
illumination was adequate and bright.
The Rev. Dr. E. R. Dille preached at
the afternoon service, which was under
the auspices of the Epworth League.
ONE NOTE OF SADNESS.
Bishop Hamilton, said Mr. Oxnam, had
his labor rewarded, for he was enabled
to dedicate the sacred edifice to the serv
ice of God. '"
It was only two weeks ago that it had
been determined to build the portable
church, and In that time, the Rev. Mr.
Oxnam said, even Bishop Hamilton act
an example to the workingmen who were
not doing the work as expeditiously as
they might. The Bishop, s*ld Mr. Ox
nam, took off his coat and, with. shovel
in hand, helped to dig tne ground and
hastened on the construction.
In that locality, said the Bishop, they
had been worshiping in a hall for the
last eleven months, but now they had
their own site, whereon stood their own
place of worship, which would In time be
replaced by a church that would be built
to stand for all time.
BISHOP HELPS DICK _ Qr
The site consists of three plats of- land,
purchased for $7500. That amount "has
been paid and J3000 more was at the- dis
posal of the trustees on condition that
they Â¦ raise an additional $1000 yesterday.
At the morning, afternoon and evening
services the offerings of the congregation
even exceeded the thousand dollars, the
sum subscribed being $1016.
There was great rejoicing at the result
and Bishop Hamilton, who had himself
subscribed over $700, performed the dedi
cation with deep thankfulness, for, as lie
said in his . morning sermon to the con
gregation, the great demand for the new
church in the locality testified to the ln^
crease of worshipers.
The new Hamilton Methodist Episcopal
Church was dedicated last night by
Bishop J. W. Hamilton, assisted by the
pastor, the Rev. C. O. Oxnam, and the
Rev. Dr. Case. The present edifice, which
is situated at Waller and Belvidere
streets, near Golden Gate Park, Is a tem
porary structure and is the first of Its
kind to be erected in the city, being con
structed In such a manner, that by the
removal of bolts it can be readily taken
to pieces and can just as easily be rebuilt.

We earnestly bespeak your Individual inftu
ence to uphold the principles to which we
stand pledged; to make our victory at the poll*
clear and unequivocal, and to put the plain
stamp at condemnation upon the last effort to
secure Individual control of our district by
means of the familiar and specious cry of
"home rule."

to scrutinize his ticket with care, aa other

In the battle of Big Hole on August 9,
1877, he was wounded twice. His gal
lantry on that occasion was later recog
nized by the War Department and he re
ceived a brevet majorshlp, dating from
February 27. 1S90. In 1S97 he gained the
full title of major and in 1S99 was ad
vanced to the rank of lieutenant colonel.
Prior to this promotion he had- been
serving with the Seventeenth and the
Nineteenth Infantries and on receipt of
his commission as lieutenant colonel he
was with the Fifteenth Infantry, which
he left to go with the- Twenty-sixth In
fantry, of which he was made colonel on
February 2. 1901.
Colonel Williams' long service with
General (then Colonel) Miles, in the cam
paign of 1877 against Sitting Bull, natur
ally made him well qualified for the ar
duous field work in the Philippines, in
which he has been engaged during the
last three years, and the fact that his
regiment was particularly- successful in
the latter campaign, old army officers
readily attribute to the experience and
courage of the determined colonel who
directed the Twenty-sixth Infantry In Its
operations.
The colonel expects to remain here only
a few days and then will go to San An
tonio, Texas, there to await the order of
his retirement. It is thought that the
officials at Washington will recognize his
brilliant career as a fighter by promoting
him to the rank of brigadier general be
fore he leaves the army.

IJLv Infantry! than whom fuw officers
in the army have seen more active
service, returned yesterday on the
transport Logan from a three years' cam
paign in the Philippines and is registered
at the Occidental Hotel. He has only
recently relinquished command of the
third district In the department of South
ern Luzon, where, while directing the
field operations, he was instrumental . in
forcing the surrender of the notorious
Filipino leader. General Belarmino, and
finally compelling the rebellious natives to
bow to the authority of the American
Government. At the time that he was
assigned to this particular command the
Filipino insurrectionists were holding full
sway In the provinces of Albay, Camarlne
Norte and Camarlne Sur and whenever
the occasion offered itself they were mak
ing raids into the neighboring province
of Sorsoeon. Within three months after
Colonel Williams and the gallant men of
the Twenty-sixth Infantry had been
sent to this district to quell these dis
turbances, the task had been fully ac
complished, the natives laying down their
arms and surrendering and a peace pro
tocol finally being issued."
Colonel Williams returns from the Phil

Detectives McMahon and Reynolds were

Waeber that he met Grottola at dinner on
i Wednesday night, with Giuseppe Smario.
proprietor of the lodging-house at 424
Broadway, where Waeber boards. During
dinner the conversation turned to frater
nal societies, and Grottola asked Waeber
if he could read and write. Waeber
laughed at him for asking such a ques
tion, and after dinner when they went
outside Grottola said to, Waeber, "What
made you laugh at me, you â fool.?"
whereupon Waeber slapped his face.
Grottola went away, but returned later
and shook hands with Waeber, then took
part In a fame of cards.
Waeber declared that he had not seen
Grottola again till noon yesterday, when
Grottola, without saying a word, fired
three shots. It Is supposed that Grottola
brooded over the slap in the face and had
fired at Waeber to avenge the insult. The
detectives say that Grottola fired a shot
at a man not long ago, feeling that he
had been Insulted.
Gennaro Grottola, a barber, living at
413}Â» Broadway, fiied three shots from a
revolver at Arnold "Waeber In front of 424
Iiroadway, where Waeber lives, about
noon yesterday. One of the bullets trav
eld around the inside of Waeber's coat
and came out at the back, and another
struck G. Demartini of 4% Jasper place,
who was standing near, on the right let,
above the knee. Inflicting a flesh wound.
Grottola after firing the three shots ran
across the street into the barber shop
of Charles Regusa, 413 Broadway, where
he was formerly employed, and escaped
through the rear door. In his flight he
dropped his hat, and this, say the Ital
ians, was a sign that if any one pursued
him beyond the hat he would have to re
turn and shoot the pursuer. No one, how
ever, had the presence of mind to chase
him and he made his escape.
The shots were heard by Detective Me
Mahon, Corporal Sylvester of the China
town squad and two of his men and Cor
poral Eastman, but when they reached
the scene no trace of Grottola could be
found. The Central Police station was
notified and Demartini was taken to the
Harbor Emergency Hospital in the patrol
wagon, where his wounded leg was
treated.

A meeting of the campaign committee
of the Union Labor party was held last
evening at Shiels' building on O'Farrell

primary election. The gathering was ex
ceedingly large, as the officers of the dis

to the Union Labor convention from the

assured their support for Mayor Schmitz
wore in attendance.
The battle between the Schmitz and
Casey forces for possession of the Union

south of Market street the contest may
be somewhat exciting. Casey's followers

ticket In the district. The names of C.
A. Murdock and John C. Currier are on
all three of the tickets.
JUDGE DIBBLE'S COUP.
The United Republican League tickets
will encounter opposition In the Twenty
eighth. Thirty-third. Thirty-fourth, Thir
ty-eighth. Fortieth, Forty-first and Forty
second Assembly districts. The league
managers regard the opposition In the
Twenty-eighth. Forty-Srst and Forty
second as decidedly formidable. Talk in
the league camp is to the effect that
Marks will be easily defeated in the For
tieth District, as many of his old-time
lieutenants have declined to line up under
his banner in this contest.
Mr. Jesse E. Marks, the proprietor of the
Toeerilte ealoon. who fcr fifteen years haa
claimed the Fortieth* Assembly District a* his
personal chattel, has eecn fit to attempt to
hold the diotrJct by & personal attack upon
those who are Interested In clean politics and
those who are adverse to delivering the district
to D&n Burn* asii Martin Kelly.
If you war.t Martin Kelly and Dan Burns to
r.axne your next Mayer and to determine what
um ehall be made of the moneys realized from
bond Issues, vote for Mark*, vrho will deliver
the delegation to Kelly.
If yru want en heneet and <tonservatlve ad
ministration of the city government, then sus
tain your own people In their effort to rid the
district of political pests and brokers by voting
the United Republican League ticket, headed
ly Mr. Henry Ach.
Mr. A. Ituef has nothing to do with the For

PROTEST AGAINST HARKS.
The aggressive attitude of Marks has
caused the issue of the following protest
from active members of the United Re
publican League of the Fortieth District:
Estimates of the number of votes that
Â¦will be cast to-morrow vary in a wide
degree. Active workers of the United Re
publican League calculate that 10,000 Re
publican ballots will be cast. It is esti
mated that the total vote of the three par
tiesâRepublican. Democratic and Union
LAborâ will exceed 25,000. It Is probable
that 1000 Republicans will participate- in
the Fortieth District battle, where the
political forces under the leadership of
Jesse Marks threaten to give the Repub
lican League one of the hardest fights of
the day.
A vast deal of Quiet work has been done
by the several political parties and fac
tions toward awakening interest in the
primary election to-morrow. The cam
paign has not been distinguished by mass
meetli^s and street demonstrations, but
circulars by thÂ« hundred thousand have
been mailed to voters. The demand on
the postal authorities for Immediate de
livery cf the campaign literature was so
preat that the department at Washing
ton came to the relief of the San Fran
cisco postofSce by authorizing the tem
porary employment of twenty-four extra
men.
The deceased was a member of the
Olympic Club and of the Corinthian
Yacht Club.
What makes his death peculiarly pa
thetic is the fact that he was engaged to
marry an estimable young lady of this
city and the ceremony was to have been
performed next month. >
"Jack" Cathcart. as he was generally
known, was born in Nevada, but came to
San Francisco when a baby and has re
sided here ever since. He was one of the
best known entertainers in the city and
for ten years past had been taking part
in public entertainments, most of them
given for charity or to help some organ
ization. He possessed a good voice and
was irresistible in the rendition of a com
ic song.
Almost his last act before his voice was
stilled forever was his appearance at the
smoker of Halcyon Parlor, N. S. G. W..
at Alameda, where he sang in company
with George Ryan. Together the two
young men came to- the city and Cath
cart started for his home in the highest
spirits. Apparently nothing was further
from his thoughts than that he was so
near to the shadow of eternity.
For several years the deceased acted
as Eastern representative of Branden
stein*& Co., the tea importers of this city.
More recently he was engaged as book
keeper for the Hercules Gas Engine Com
pany.
Cathcart's mother used to keep the
lodging-house at 829 Pine street, but re
tired recently and is living at 730 Pine
street. Detective Anthony Informed her
of her son's death, and her grief was most
intense. He was SO years of age and un
married.
John Cathcart, who was one of the best
known and most popular young men in
the city, was found dead in bed in his
room at 829 Pine street yesterday after
noon. The apartment was full of gas.
The discovery was made by Miss Hall,
the landlady, and she immediately noti
fied the Morgue. Deputy Coroner Brown
went to the house, and on satisfying him
self that it was a case of accidental death
did not remove the body to the Morgue.
Detective Anthony was detailed on the
case, and he ascertained that Cathcart
arrived home about 4:30 o'clock yesterday
morning, and as he had forgotten his keys
he rang up the landlady, who opened the
door for him. He was in his usual good
spirits and went straight to his bedroom.
That was the last seen of him alive.
The bracket was at the head of his bed.
and by reaching out his hand he could
turn the gas or electric lights on or off.
It is supposed that by some means he ac
cidentally turned on the gas after turning
it off.
