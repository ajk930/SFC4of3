satisfied that Kuhnle waa not killed for
the money he had In his pocket when he

Constables are searching the hills in

PARIS. Sept. 13.â On the occasion of the
unveiling: of a memorial to Ernest Renan,
the historian, at his native town of Tre
guier, Brittany, to-day, some demonstra
tions were made against Premier Combes
in the villages through wnich his car
riage passed on the way to Tregulr from
Portreaux. Shouts of "A bas Combes!"
and "Vive la Llberte!" were raised by
the peasants- At the ceremony, at which
cpeeches were delivered bv Anatole
France and . others. Premier Combes, in
expressing his thanks for the excellent
reception given him at the function said:
"I heard a few hisses. Let mÂ« compare
them to the melodies played on the flute
behind the conqueror's chariot Jn olden
times to remind them that, raised by the
people, they must govern by the people."
During the delivery of the speeches the
antagonists of Premier Combes because so
threatening, trying to force the barrier
and shouting denunciations of the Mayor
of Tregulr, that the police -and authori
ties being unable to restore order, a de
tachment of troops whs ordered out.- The
soldiers forced the hostile crowd back and
restored quiet.
PEASANTS WELL ORGANIZED.
The Premier was accompanied by Sena
tor Chaumie. Minister of Public Instruc
tion, who delivered a eulogy of Renan,
many Republican Deputies for Brittany
and other personages. The memorial took
the form of a ,bronze statue representing
t Renan seated, in a. characteristic- attitude.
"while behind stands a golden figure of
Minerva holding- up a sprigr of laurel.
Among the decorations around the statue
were ornamental mottoes Inscribed "Vive
Renan," "Long live free thought," etc.,
which particularly incensed the Catholics.
The latter arranged for an expiatory ser
vice in Treguier Cathedral to take place
at the same hour as the unveiling of the
statue, with the participation of Abbe
Gayraud and other Clerical Deputies.
The Clerical party had thoroughly or
ganized its demonstration and the peas
ants from the surrounding villages as
sembled at Treguier, armed with cudgels
and accompanied by their women folk,
clad in the picturesque costumes of Brit
tany. Seme of the bands were headed by
the parish priests. The Republican vil
lagers also gathered at Treguier and along
the route taken by the Premier, and the
two hostile parties raised cries and coun
ter cries. During the ceremony of the
unveiling the Clericals did their best to
drown the voices of the speakers with
shouts of "Down with Renan." "Down
with Combes," etc., to which the Repub
licans replied with equally noisy vocifera
tions.
TROOPS PREVENT A CLASH.
The presence of a strong force of troops
prevented a free fight between the rival
factions.
Another demonstration and counter
demonstration took place when Premier
Combes visited the house in which Renan
was born, and during the disorder Baron
ess Kerpodson was hustled by the crowd.
An anti-Clerical who drew his revolver
was arrested and the husband of the Bar
oness was roughly handled.
A bancuet of 2000 "Blues," as the Re
publicans are called in Brittany, followed
the unveiling exercises, at which Premier
Combes, in the course of a long speech,
predicted that the time was not distant
when the peasants of Brittany would
j-hakt: off the yoke of the clergy. He de
fended the policy of the Government, say
ing he had only to repeat the history of
the last few months in order to demon
strate that the clergy had persistently
violated the law, supported the un
authorized congregations In their rebellion
against thn civil authorities and stirred
up the population to a religious war.

her sacred duty to prevent the Christian
people being done to death. In a couple

IN SEARCH

The people here are very much excited
over the assassination and axe convinced
that It was not the work of the common

assassin if he be captured are being made
by some Indignant citlzeaa.
"Then my husband got out of the bug
gy," she said, "and the stranger told him
to walk to. the rear. lie didn't obey, but
tried to make his way to the front. Soon
I heard a shot, and then two more."
Mrs. Kuhnle said to-night that when the
assassin stepped out of the brush and
ordered her husband to alight from the
buggy his voice was husky and his enun
ciation so indistinct that she thought tho
command was addressed to her. She
started to leave the vehicle, but was told
by the desperado that the man. and not
the woman, was the person wanted.
Shortly before 12 o'clock to-night Sheriff
Ivlns reported that a number of valuable
clews had been found, but that the as
sassin had not yet been located. One of
the members of the posse Is on the way
back to town from the mountains, and
it is hoped that he may bring with him
news of the capture or the surrounding:
of the? murderer.
It is believed here that some former
employe on the Kuhnle property who had
been discharged allowed his resentment to
get the better of his reason and satisfied
his desire for revenge by playing success
fully the role of the midnight assassin.
This, however, is not much more than
conjecture, but in the light of distress
ingly inadequate developments it serves
the purpose of the hour.
purpose of disconcerting the authorities
as to the nature of the assassin's real
motive. According to Mrs. Kuhnle's
statement the conduct of the assassin
w~.s not that which might be expected
from a bandit intent solely on robbery.

TO USE FOR SUICIDE
The entire crew of the Olympla wera return
ing aboard after forty-eight hours' ahoro lib
erty. _ when a tive-gallon water breaker full of
alcohol ,wai discovered In thÂ« forward turret.
The executive officer, at once ordered a thor
ough search of the ship and the yard In her
vicinity to find any. other spirits that might
have - been emuggled. As the cruiser Is In
drydock. all her small- boats are 'lined in rows
along the wharf near thÂ« drydock. Between
two of these boats two men were discovered.
One of them escaped In , the- darkness; The
other Was placed under arrest. Where the men
were hiding was found a full barrel of alcohol,
which had been broached. ' It was by- order
carried aboard the Olympla to be emptied into
the alcohol tank on the after deck. This tank
being full, the barrel was carried forward by
Corporal Yerkes, Selfert. Shavey and Caster.
In the meantime the crew was called to quar
ters and every man accounted for.
While the men were in lines answering the
roll the detachment with the barrel J began
pouring its contents into a tank on the port
side of the forward turret. They had scarcely
begun work when, in a manner yet to be ascer
tained, the fumes of. the spirits became ignited
and exploded with terrific ' force. B Both ends
of the barrel wera blown out, followed by a
torrent of burning alcohol that spread in a
flood of flame over the forward deck. Terkes
was struck In the head by a stave from the
barrel and fell into the burning mass. He was
roasted to death. The other three men also
were struck by flying fragments of the barrel,
but were knocked away from tne center 'of the
flre and thus two. of them escaped fatal injury,
but Belfert was horribly burned.
It was at first thought a tank of smokeless
powder had exploded and the crew for a mo
ment broke ranks, but In a second recovered
from the suddenness of the shock and turned
to with a- will to save the injured and extin
guish the flre, which already was gaining head
way on the cruiser's deck. This done, the In
jured men were hurried to the Marine Hospi

It was rumored to-night that the dinner
might be called off altogether. That could
not be verified, but a member of the club
said that it was being considered.

oped. He said that at the New York
Yacht Club a few nights ago he had
asked Sir Thomas Liptcn if he had an
engagement for the ISth inst. Being as
sured that he had not, he requested Sir
Thomas to hold that date open in order
that he might attend the Seawanhaka
dinner. He pointed out that a rule of the
club permitted a member to Invite a
guest to attend the club dinners. His In
vitation to Sir Thomas was extended as
a member and not on behalf of the Â£lub.
OYSTER BAY. M. T.. Sept. 13.â The re
port that President Roosevelt has ob
jected to the presence of Sir Thomas Lip
ton at a banquet which the President
himself was 10 attend at the Seawanhaka-
Cortnthlan Yacht Club house on Center
Island en September 18 is explained by
the statement to-day that the President,
when he accepted the invitation to the
banquet, did so with this understanding
that It was to be a. mere neighborly af
fair, and that there would be no outside
guests present. It is said, further, that
Mr. Roosevelt had already entertained Sir
Thomas- Lipton at luncheon in Washing
ton and had him on the Mayflower, and
did not, under the circumstances, think it
would be advisable to give the impression
that he was overdoing the matter by ap
pearing at the Yacht Club dinner with
him at Oyster Bay.
Secretary lx>eb went out to see the
President early this afternoon.

most departments was easier. This de
pressed feeling was due to the continued
fall in consols, the uneasiness as to pos
sible withdrawals of gold, the condition
of affairs in the Balkans and the unset

of Americans were very unsettled, but
wers firmer at thÂ« end of the week on

that there will be a strong probability of

the Albanian troops has been exceedingly
bad and that they are quite out of hanu,

troops to prevent them.
The Moriastir correspondent of the Daily
Mail has had an interview with the com

the truth of the burnings and atrocities,

committing them.

LONDON, Sept. 13.â Premier Bal

NEW YORK, Sept. 13.â The sailors of
the flagship Kearsarge, which, together
with the Alabama, Texas, Illinois and
Chicago, anchored off Staten Island to
day, have been in a condition bordering
on mutiny, it was learned to-day, for
many weeks. By sailors and petty of
ficers on other ships it was said that
when the Kearsarge came to anchor 120
men were imprisoned in the brig because
of mutinous conduct. These men say
they have renamed the flagship the
"Cursthard" on account of the voluble
dissatisfaction continually expressed by
the crew. By this cognomen the Kear
sarge is known, they say, by all the other
vessels of the squadron.
In the recent shooting contests in the
maneuvers the gunners of the Kearsarge
scored six shots out of twelve, the Ala
bama beating the record with fifteen out
of sixteen, and every other vessel of the
squadron showing a first rate average.
According to the sailors the gunners of
the Kearsarge in revenge for grievances,
real or fancied, of long standing, by
agreement with the crew, determined to
make as poor a showing as they coula,
and to clinch this agreement some ven
turesome spirits, not yet discovered,
threw overboard all the lenses of the gun
tights, thereby rendering expert marks
manship impossible. Several of the men
on the Kearsarge verified this, although
all said they had been instructed before
being allowed to go ashore not to say
anything/ about this incident.

is not likely that there will be any
change in the attitude of the Government
toward the Macedonian insurrectionâ a
"hands-off" policyâ so long as Russia and
Austria seem disposed to promote no ul
terior motive in their efforts to restore
peace in the disturbed area. As to Rus

may not result in changing this- "attitude

Lord Rosebery's advocacy of the ap

WASHINGTON, Sept. 13.â John Barrett,
who visited Asia as commissioner of the
Louisiana Purchase Exposition In behalf
of the exposition management, has issued
a statement with reference to foreign par
ticipation in the exposition. He says In
part:
Although in the introductory negotiations
such important Governments as Russia and
Austria in Kurope and Japan and China in
Asia declined to participate, and the outlook
was discouraging for other prominent nations,
thirty-flve of the forty odd independent coun
tries of the world now have formally accepted
the invitation to take part, while not less than
ten of the great colonies of European nations
are preparing comprehensive exhibits entirely
apart front those of ; the home governments.
The countries above mentioned as at first re
fusing to bo represented have finally reconsid
ered their action and decided to take part on
an unprecedented scale.
In short, forty-five foreign lands, independent
and dependent, will be seen In miniature, as it
were, at St. Louis In 1904.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, 8ept. 13.â Bullseye and
target hits at the rate of 1.2S each min
ute from her th!rteen-lnch gun Is what
Is declared by the officers to be the world
breaking record brought to port to-day
by the United States battleship Alabama.
With the battleship Kearsarge, t!iÂ«
flagship of Rear Admiral Barker; the Il
linois and the Texas, the Alabama, la
command of Captain Davis, steamed from
the firing ground off "the south shore of
Marthas Vineyard on Saturday evening
and anchored before noon to-day off
Tompkinsville. Approached in the excel
lence of their gunnery only by the men
of the- Illinois, the men of the Alabama
were congratulated by the flagship at the
close of their work. The fleet now await3
the official figures showing the standing
of the competitors.
Built to be flred at the rate of one shot
every two minutes, the gun crew of tha
Alabama handled the thirteen-lnch guns
so that two and a half hits were mada
In that time. The highest individual hon
ors go to Seaman C A. Brightup. gun
pointer, who. at his post at the left-hand
gun No. 4 in the after turret, made four
hits In two minutes and eight 3econd3.
the target being 1600 yards away and thÂ«
ship steaming at an eight-knot rate. Sea
men Allen and Fletcher, gun-pointers,
scored 1.14 hits a minute, the highest av
erage for the sun.
It Is said by the officer of the ship that
the record of the two guns has not beta
equaled, for of sixteen shots fired all hit
the target with the exception of one,
which struck the floating frame on which
the rectangle of canvas twenty-one feet
long and seventeen feet high was erected.
Had it been in battle the shot3 would
have struck the waterline of the enemy,
a most vulnerable spot. The Â¦ projectile
flred weighed 1100 pounds, with SCO pound*
powder charge.
Besides the thirteen-inch gun practice,
those on board the Ala bam* maintain
that they have beaten the fleet in the
handling of the six-inch rapid ftre rifles.
Seaman Webber, gun-pointer, averaged
6.55 hits a minute on a target twenty-one
feet long and eight feet hign, 1600 yards
away, the ship steaming at' ten knots.
Seamen Marchant and MInchlon, pointers
of six-inch guns, made an average of 6.23
hits for their piece and lost because ona
shot went over the mark.
Private Marine McHenry, in charge of
a six-pounder, also made a record of lO.at
hits a minute.
Vaux refused absolutely to give any
more uetails than contained in this state
ment. From other sources, however, it
was learned that dimes, quarters and
half dollars were the coins manufactured.
The discoverey was made several days
ago. and United States secret service of
ficials were .immediately called in. Their
investigation, it is learned, is still in
progress, their principal object being to
learn whether there was collusion be
tween the convicts and employes of the
Institution.
It is believed the discovery of counter
feiters in the prison was due to the in
vestigation now being carried on as a re
pult of charges of irregularity. These
became public last week and Warden
Bessir.ger and the overseer of the cigar
department were temporarily relieved
from duty and the penitentiary placed in
charge of Rev. Joseph Welch, the chap
lain. It is alleged that thousands of cigars
made by the convicts are unaccounted
for; that thousands of them did not con
tain the internal revenue stamps, and
that in many instances the law requiring
prison-made cigars to be stamped "con
vict-made" was ignored. How long this
has been carried en is yet to be learned.
The government of the penitentiary is
vested in a board of five inspectors ap
pointed by the Governor, who serve with
out salary. This board is now making an
inspection of each branch of the institu
tion, and has employed an expert ac
countant to go over the books. In addi
tion to this, the Internal revenue officers
are carrying on a separate investigation.
Dr. William D. Robinson, one of the in
spectors, in speaking of the affair, said
that the inspectors have not found any
thing that militates atraJnst th^ personal
integrity and ability of the Warden, but
had found abundant evidence that the old
methods so long in vogue are faulty and
antiquated. Warden Bessinger has been
permitted to engage an accountant to
protect his interests in the matter of his
accounts.
PHILADELPHIA, Sept. 13.â Following
closely upon the exposure of gross Irreg
ularities in the cigar department of the
Eastern State penitentiary came the an
nouncement to-night that ilk-gal coinage
of minor silver pieces has been carried on
by convicts in the big Institution. No do
talls of the counterfeiting scheme can be
learned from any of the officials connect
*<* with the prison, or from the Govern
ment officers that have been assigned to
the case. The fact that such a daring
scheme has been carried out in the peni
tentiary was made-*M*blic by George Vaui
Jr., one of the prison inspectors, who
summoned newspaper men'to his home
and voluntarily made the disclosure. He
gave out a brief statement, which is as
follows:
Dr. W. D. Robinson and Mr. Vaux Jr.. who
are at f resent the visiting inspectors on duty
at the Eastern State penitentiary, made the
â¢tatement that it has come to their official
knowledge that within a short time an at
tempt has boÂ«n made by certain convict? now
ecafined in the penitentiary to manufacture
counterfeit r'lver coins. But a few pieces
were made, and a number at these have come
into the possession of the inspectors, tcsether
with the metals ar.d chemicals used, the Â«t
tempt thus being nipped in the bud. The evi
<1enee in the raÂ»e is not yet complete, but all
That has been secured has been submitted to
the United States authorities.

There is no doubt that President Roose
velt appreciates the temper of Congress
on this point. That he does is the best
reason for the belief that soon after he
returns to Washington steps will be taken
toward the drawing of a treaty with Nic
argua and Costa Kica. unless a miracle
should be worked in Bogota before Sep
tember 22 and the Hay-Herran treaty,
already rejected, be ratified. No one here
expects that. The State Department of
ficials talk ot the Hay-Herran treaty as
being beyond hope ot resurrection.
The administration is secretive about Its
plans in regard to the canal, but it will
take only a few days to draw a treaty
when the representatives of Nicaragua
and Costa Rica are empowered to sign
treaties. Then the President can send
a message to Congress reciting the futile
efforts to obtain a treaty with Colombia
and transmitting a treaty providing for
the construction of a Nicaraguan canal.
WASHINGTON. Sept. 13.â With the
Hay-Herran treaty conceded as dead and
the formal period for the exchange of rat
ification expiring on September 22, Pres
ident Roosevelt has yet given no indi
cation that he is ready to negotiate for
a Nicaraguan canal, in conformity with
the provisions of the Spooner act. If he
does not open such negotiations Senator
Morgan cf Alabama, chairman of the
Committee on Interoceanic Canals, will
offer a joint resolution directing the draw
ing of a treaty with Nicaragua and Costa
Rica. '

PANAMA, Sept. 13.â Rodolfe Aguillera,
the first newspaperman to publish articles
in favor of the secession of the Isthmus
of Panama, is to be prosecuted. It is cur
rently reported that two thousand Fed
eral troops are coming to the isthmus.
BOGOTA, Sept. 13.-A proposal made by
Benor Perez y Sotos to ask the executive
to appoint an antl-seccesslonist Governor
in Panama has been approved by the
Senate. Speaker3 in the SeD*Â»Â±s ea'd that
Senor Obaldla, who was recently ap
pointed Governor of Panama and who is
favorable to a canal treatv, was dan
pe-rous to national integrity. President
Marroquin protested against thf- action
of the Senate. President Marroquin suc
ceeded later !n calming the Congressmen.
It appear? he was able to g:ve them sat
isfactory reasons for Governor Obaldia's
appoint merits.
The Bogota Government appears to real
ize the imminent peril of the Isthmus of
Panama declaring its ir.dependmct.' Senor
Sesoux. representative of the Panama
constituency, recently delivered a sensa
tional speech In the House. Among other
things he said: _;
In Panama the Bishops, Governors, magis
trates, military commanders and their sub
ordinates havÂ« been and are foreign to the
department. It teems that the Government
with surprising tenacity wishes to exclude
itself from all participation In public affairs.
As regards International dangers, all I can
say is that if thei>e dangers exist they are
due to the conduct of the national Govern
ment, v.-hlch is in th* direction of reaction.
If the Colombian Government will not lleten to
the rerrt-e^nUitions made with a view to pre
venting disaster the responsibility -will rfst
with it alone. Not a native of Panama Is
obeying the reactionary lawn.
The bill dealing with the settlement of
foreign claims arising out of the revolu
tionVias met with no opposition in the
Legislature. It seems that Congress after
the recent political discussions has lost all
energy and has entirely forgotten Panama
canal matters.

PEKING, Saturday. Sept. 12 (delayed in

the Chinese Government a new scheme
for evacuation, originally fixed for Oc
tober 8. and proposing certain new con
ditions In addition to most of the condi
tions Included in the last scheme. Rus
sia now proposes to evacuate Newchwang

province four months later and the third
province* a year later. Among the new
conditions, Russia stipulates that she
shall maintain military posts on the road
from Tsltsihar. capital of Heilung Klang.
to Blagovostchensk and on the Sungarl
River. The reason Russia gives for main
taining these posts Is that they are nec
essary to protect the commerce of the
railroad.
There Is a vaguely worded clause pro
hibiting heavy duties on goods transport
ed by the railroad, which the diplomats
construe as exempting Russian goods
transported on the railway from the sur
tax which the Japanese and American
treaties substitute for the likin duties.

SINCE New Hampshire and Vermont have aban
doned their ancient policy of total prohibition
and have entered upon a trial of license and
local option, the stalwart and stern prohibitionists
have turned their hopes to the South. In those
States where once the Puritan was derided there now
seems to be more of the spirit of Puritanism than
in New England itself. At any rate, the progress of
prohibition in the South has become one of the
salient features of the times and is sufficiently remark
able tc attract general attention.
According to a prohibition organ, "The Â« New
Voice," published in Chicago, there are now more
saloons in the State of New York alone than in the
entire eleven States of the South. 1 It is said that in
Texas 136 counties have total prohibition, 62 partial,
and in 46 the sale of liquors is unrestricted. Ten
nessee has 5500 towns and cities; in only eight of
them is there unrestricted sale; in only 12 of the 06
counties can liquor be sold legally. In Kentucky 47
counties have total prohibition, 54 partial and in 18
free sale is permitted. Arkansas has 44 teetotal coun
ties, while 29 can sell as they like, with no legal re
strictions. Georgia has 100 prohibition counties, with
only 37 the other way.
Various causes are assigned for the popular sup
port given to prohibition in these States. In the first
place there are in the South very few foreigners ac
customed to the free use of wine or beer, and as the
older elements of the American population are gen
erally averse to the liquor traffic, it is natural there
should be stronger sentiment of that kind in Uie
South than in other sections where the foreign ele
ment is larger. In the next place the fear that the
negro population might become demoralized if
whisky were easily obtainable has inclined the rural
counties to go almost solidly for prohiBition. Finally,
it is said that in Texas the liquor men undertook to
evade the license laws and to run politics, with the
result of rousing an antagonism that has pretty well
suppressed the trade throughout the State.
The results of the experiment with prohibition in
the South will doubtless be similar to those that fol
lowed in New England. For a time the zeal of the
reformers will enable the State and county officers to
enforce the law, but gradually the "weakening will
come, and then there will be a repetition of the prac
tices that made prohibition in New . Hampshire and
Vermont such a scandal that the people after fifty\
years of trial decided to get rid of it Unquestion
ably, however, it is of advantage to the rural South
PROHIBITION IN THE SOUTH.
An American who killed his partner in Mexico was
sentenced a few days ago by a Mexican court to serve

addition to the Penal Code of California to cover the
cases of that extremely dangerous element known as
deer hunters.
Conditions on the Pacific Slope "continue cheerful.
Moderate crops, which are quoted above the normal
prices, keep the farmers and merchants in good
humor, credits excellent and the banks well supplied
with funds. Nobody is complaining and everybody
expects another good year. The volume of domestic
and foreign trade is large, collections are as good
as they have been at any time and failures are neither
numerous nor large. In fact, taking the whole coas:
into consideration, conditions may be described as
brilliant.
The feeling in the iron and steel trades in still
somewhat pessimistic and buyers are holding off,
while some descriptions have declined still further.
Provisions have shown more animation at Western
packing centers and supplies of cattle and hogs are
reported more plentiful and gradually increasing, a
natural consequence of the boom in livestock of the
past four or five years, during which many stock
raisers have accumulated fortunes.
The New York stock market continues tame and
without any particular tendency in either direction.
Fluctuations of late have been narrow and the public
urc holding aloof. No more is heard of the forma
tion of gigantic syndicates with vast capitalizations.
Their day has passed for the present. New York
bankers say that the supply of undigested securities
has not even yet become eliminated, but it has been
reduced to a point where it is no longer a serious
menace to the stock market and the business interests
of the country. The bankers are also pointing out
that stocks as a rule are now down to a plane where
they can be purchased for investment purposes with
reasonable safety and that many of them are now
positively cheap from a dividend-paying point of
view. Thus reassured, the public may again enter the
market after the summer vacation, which is now in
its last days.
Lumber still rules firm and active in the West, but
:.he Eastern markets are still more or less inactive, as
capital has not yet recovered from the sharp scare it
got last spring whin the whole country seemed to be
cither on strike or about to J go on one, and the cost
of material and wages had advanced to a point where
extended building operations had become more or
>ss hazardous.
There were several favorable features last week.
Some sections of the country reported a better fall
demand for goods than last year, and more favorable
weather stimulated the retail trade in others. It
is now kugwn that the crops of the country will not
be a.- enormous as expected along in the spring, but
none' of the great farm staples show a serious falling
off. The wheat crop has steadily diminished in sire
with the advancement of the season, and the last
Government report, issued on Friday, indicates a
combined winter and spring wheat yield of about
620.000.000 bushels, against anywhere from 700.000,000
to 750.000.000 confidently figured on in the early
-pring. Prices are good, however, and more net
money m2y be realized from the diminished crop
than if it had been larger. The South reports excel
lent prospects for corn, cotton, rice and sugar.
GENERAL trade shows few new features.
The volume of business appears smaller than
at this time last year, but it was then abnor
nia.iv large and nobody conversant with the drift of
commerce expected it to continue at high pressure
indefinitely. The shrinkage is partially illustrated by
a loss in the bank clearings of 41 9 P" cent from the
corresponding week in 1002, while the aggregate
clearings have still further decreased to $1,420420,000,
the smallest showing for several years. Another un
satisfactory sign in this direction is that every impor
tant city in the country except Kansas City exhibits a
loss, that at New York being 54.2 per cent, largely
due, no doubt, to the marked decrease in stock spec
ulation in Wail street. Boston and Philadelphia
show losses of 29 and 34 per cent respectively, while
Chicago enjoys the smallest decrease, it being only
6.4 per cent. As tar as these clearings are an indica
tion the country is doing less business than in 1902,
but it may be quite as profitable in net results. The
failures for the week were 172, against 205 last year,
and there were none large enough to attract atten
tion beyond their locality.
CONDITION OF TRADE.
situation. * /
The proceedings of Murphy, Parks and the other;
walking delegates who have; been sentenced to the
penitentiary in New York for bribery and extortion
have revealed a labor situation in which no investor
Is safe. The calling of strikes to extort money for
the pocket of the walking delegate has inflicted enor
mous losses upon contractors and property owners.
There is a universal law which dominates all produc
tion. It is exterminated utterly whenever it has put
upon it greater burdens than it can bear. When rail
roads charge a freight upon any article so high that
its value is exhausted in passing from producer to
consumer that production ceases. Union labor hav
ing put upon construction a greater burden than it
can bear, that form of production ceases.
It is not only the planned $310,000,000 of railroad
construction and building in New York and Chicago
that 1 will be exterminated, but the blight will fall
upon construction everywhere and in every city. In
Chicago the owner of a building under construction
was-notified by the labor unions concerned to change
contractors and iake one 'that the unions dictated
when the work was half finished. This exaction was
submitted to. Then the owner was compelled to
pay to the unions a fine of $1 per thousand on the
brick that had been used in the building and the work
was suspended until this exaction was submitted to.
There were no reasons given beyond an exhibit of
the power to enforce the demands made. In this
way the cost of construction has been increased and
its progress hampered until investors and contractors
are tired of the risk and so they will quit.
Investors in business buildings in cities arrange
their leases in advance. Their prospective tenants in
turn arrange to give up their present quarters and
the landlord jn his turn arranges f6F~new lessees.
In countless cases these erratic interruptions of con
struction so drag out the 'completion of buildings
that the time limit .of the leases expires, but the
prospective lessees have agreed to give up their pres
ent quarters and their successors are waiting to take
them; so it occurs that men are thrown out of busi
ness and have to sacrifice their stock and suffer great
loss and in some cases ruin, all bji reason of the in
terference of the walking delegate with construction.
It is a. case of putting upon that form of production
a greater burden than it will bear, and the loss goes
back and blights all dependent .forms of production,
and so hard times begin.
It was hoped that union labor would be admon
ished by the exposure of Murphy, Parks and other
walking delegates. But instead of that the unions
have voted to them the same confidence and leader
ship in convict stripes that they enjoyed in plain
clothes, and this has been the determining cause of
the canceling of $310,000,000 in contracts for con
structive production.
THE only cloud above the financial horizon is
the prospective withdrawal of capital from
constructive enterprises.
Construction of railroads and buildings is a form
of production. It goes back to the raw material, the
ore, flux and fuel to produce metal and the^stone
and the clay; to the lead and the flax plant that com
bine in paint, and to the various pigments used; to
the silica and soda for glass, and. to the timber in its
various forms that enters into construction and to
the, skilled processes by which each is reduced to use
ful form. When construction is. planned it promotes
all activities clear back to the primitive forms of all
the materials used. When construction ceases those
activities cease, and then is the paralysis, of non use.
That paralysis we call "hard times." Its effects fall
first and hardest upon labor, for construction,: being
a form of production that stimulates all other forms
by its consumption of them, is the goose that lays
the golden egg for labor. ' Therefore labor should be
advised not to kill that goose, for it is now chasing
her arou.nd.the national barnyard, ax in hand, to cut
off her head and rip her open:
Already the railroads' of the. United States have
announced their abandonment of construction planned
for next year that called for the payment of $180,000,
000, giving as a reason the burdens laid upon such
production by the labor situation. In New York
buildings' planned for erection next* year at a cost
of $60,000,000 and buildings in Chicago to cost $70,
000,000 are abandoned for the same reason. Owners
of such prospective buildings and contractors for their
erection find it Unsafe . to proceed, for they don't
know when they may touch a live wire in the labor

THE GOOSK AND THE GOLD EGG.
It is seldom, that we hear from old Tuolumne, but
when we do the news is well worth the reading. She
now is bubbling with excitement over a duel, a trag
edy ami a mystery all blinched in one. Any one of
these incidental affairs of community life, much less
the three, would, be enough to set San Francisco agog
for a day.
The forests of the continent are making their last
stand here. Here therefore should be concentrated
the efforts of the friends of the forest to preserve
what we have and begin the creation of more, for
not elsewhere in the world is the forest as important
to every material interest of the people.
But the planting of trees for a forest crop is a new
thing with our people. They know all other sorts of
planting for crops which our lands produce, but this
is novel. As soon as they are instructed they may be
depended upon to take it up with enthusiasm and
intelligence. A forestry school in the university
would be of material benefit in this matter, and Mr.
Pinchot's promotion of that foundation is highly ap
preciated.
The Philadelphia Record is urging replanting of the
slopes of the Alleghany Mountains in that State.
Lumbering and fire have stripped them and the ef
fect on moisture and the climate is disastrous. The
land that has been laid bare is useless for agriculture
and useful only for arboriculture. Actual experiment
has shown that much of this denuded land will in
twenty years produce a merchantable crop of black
walnut yielding $1000 per acre or a value of $25 per
year for the time employed in producing the crop.
For about ten years of that tpe a nut crop is pro
duced that will pay interest on the investment. If
planted thirty feet apart each acre will bear fifty
trees. As the crop approaches maturity another may
be planted on the same land, so that the yield is made
constant. Large walnut timber in the natural forest
now sells at $3000 per acre, and there is no, prospect
that this timber will decrease in value. ;
Mr. Gifford Pinchot has been urging the replanting
of our denuded forest lands in California. He is one
of the foremost authorities on forestry in the world,
and California will get much of value, from his in
struction. There are two policies of vast importance
to the present and future of this State in which he
can assist us. One is the prevention of forest fires,
which destroy the standing crop and the forest-pro
ducing character of the land and the other is the re
planting of lands that have been stripped. In our
foothills and mountains are millions of acres, once
timbered and now covered with chemisal, manzanita
and coffee bush, useless for agriculture and horticul
ture, which can be made to bear timber. If Mr.
Pinchot succeed in getting the work of replanting at
some point where it serves as an object lesson the
owners of these lands will be induced to replant them.
True, it may be said that the crop is of slow growth
and the man who plants may not harvest. But as
soon as the growth of the crop is established the
lands have value, and this will increase until the crop
is ready to cut. The soil is especially fitted for the
growth of coniferous trees and the yellow and sugar
pine grow here more rapidly than elsewhere, so that
we have the best conditions for reforesting and a
prospect of the quickest retur-n. . .
THE spread of a right conception of the pur
pose of scientific forestry is very gratifying to
those who pioneered the cause in this country.
The Eastern press has recently made quite a specialty
of forestry, with the result that former timber lands
not fit for agriculture are now considered of value
for raising timber and are being planted for wood as
a crop.
The hill country and mountains of New England
and the Middle States, once timbered but now bare,
are being put into white and yellow pine, black wal
nut and even oak, the slowest growing of all. In
the South it is probable that the eucalyptus will flour
ish and it. is evident th;t. we are not yet aware of the
economic value of many of the varieties of that tree.
It flourishes in California and makes a rapid growth
and has been found of value for fuel. There are
about forty varieties of this tree and in Australia
many of them are used for piling and for dimension
timber. 'The leaves and bark arc rich in essential oil
that has been found of therapeutic value and enters
into many medicinal preparations useful in^ diseases of
the respiratory system.

THE SAN FRANCISCO Â¦ CA-Lii- MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 14, 1903.
William Mackabee, an inmate of, the Naval Home in Phil
adelphia, celebrated his 100th birUiday September 5 last. He
was born In Baltimore in 1S03 and entered the navy at the
age of 14, years, serving as an apprentice on the Constitution.
He 'was always before the mast and entered the home about
thirty-five years ago. Mackabee is the oldest veteran of the
American navy.
.The engineer officers In the United States navy are rap
idly diminishing,- the loss since July. 1S98, being sixty-nine.
Five years ago there were 210 and on July 1 last there were
only 141. . The available . number for sea duty is -now 125.
.whereas Jt was 199,in 1898. In. the course of ten years there
will be only about fifty officers in the former engineer corps
for sea service and- tho deficiency will have to be. supplied
from the regular line officers, who have a superficial knowl
edge of marine engineering, and from . the warrant machin
ists' corps..
There are , 136 officers in the navy eligible for retirement
as-rear- admirals during the ten years up to 1914. . Of this
number, twenty-four are rear admirals,- seventy-fonr : captains,
thirty-one i commanders.' one , medical' .director and six pay
directors. .'-The personnel -law .-. of March. 3, 1899, provided:
â¢â¢That! any officer of the : navy wftn a creditable record, who
served, during the Civil War, shall, when retired, be Â¦ retired.
The above fleet is remarkable only because of its non
homogeneity. Only three of the battleships could be depended
upon to set the pace at fifteen knots. The five battleships
and two protected cruisers constituted the sole fighting force,
as the four cruisers are converted merchant steamers, any one
<jf which may be sunk by a fourteen-pound shell fired at a
distance of one mile. Of the four gunboats, the Newport is
the only bona fide navy vessel, the Topeka being rather an
tiquated, and the other two . are converted yachts. The ap
pellation of dispatch-boat' to the Dolphin, of thirteen knots,
is.a misnomer, and the three training ships are built of wood
-and of no possible, use in a naval engagement. This list of
twenty, named vessels closes with the sailing ship Monon
gahela. Admiral Dewey should have no fear that any ir
responsible writer would ever think of comparing* the above
fleet with those of foreign navies, for there is a limit to a
reporter's Imagination as well j as to the credulity of the pub
lic. In Â¦. two years , hence, however, we may be able to make
as good a shqwing as Germany.
In addition to the above vessels there were also five de
stroyers, three tugs, eight colliers and supply vessels, mak
ing a total of thirty-six craft of . all kinds.
The French armored cruiser Jules Ferry, building in dock
at Cherbourg, was to be floated on August 25. Five vessel
of this type, Identical in all particulars, are befngr built
in dockyards and are making good progress. Each of these
cruisers is to be 482.29 feet In length, 72.13 feet beam and 12,600
tons displacement on a draught aft of 2S.9 feet, on which tne
normal coal carried is 1320 tona. The triple-screw engines are
to develop 27,500 horsepower, to give a speed of 22 knots. The
armor belt, extending all around the ship, is to have a max
imum thickness of 6.9 Inches, tapering to 4 inches at the enda.
and the armored deck Is to be 1.77 inches on. the flat. The
armament will consist of four 7.6-lnch. sixteen 6.4-lnch, twenty
3- pounders, four and five toperdo tubes, two of
which latter are, submerged. The average cost of these ships.
is estimated at $5,875,000. The Jules â¢ Ferry . is - to receive her
armor from a float alongside the ship instead of by the
usual method of putting It on while on the stocks in dock,
the chief advantage being that It makes the dock available
for other uses not less than six months ahead oÂ£ taÂ« uÂ«ui:

The annual naval maneuvers of the German navy began

The British Admiralty recently sent a circular letter to thÂ©
several dockyards and shore stations, requesting' the view3
of those in authority as to the practicability of emnloylng 1
women as copyists, flagmakers. upholsterers, etc. The ma
jority of the replies were not favorable to the employment
of women on work done by men.
The tactical exercises of the British fleet off Lagos Bay
began August 18 and continued six days. The fleet, consist
ing of twenty-flve battleships, thirty-eight cruisers and all
of the Mediterranean torpedo flotilla, was divided in divis
ions under the command of one .admiral, two vice admirals
and five rear admirals. The purpose of these operations has
been to enable each of the admirals to have the opportunity
of handling the great force In tactical evolutions in order to
illustrate their individual qualities. Incidentally, but not
less important, was the severe test to which each ship-'waa
put In steaming at full speed a distance of 800 miles.

extent as to cause the officer In charge to resort to drastio

desirous of serving on that ship and resort to all sorts of
methods to get out of "Old Heine," as they have nicknamed
It. More than 200 sailors are reported to have deserted sines

and not one "answered to the call for. volunteers posted up

there are now two hoodoo ships in the navy. The case of;
the. Texas is one to upset the nerves of such susceptible peo
ple as sailors. Faulty construction necessitated a new bot
tom and new gun deck and a continued series of accidents
due to mismanagement made "the sailors shy of the ship.
But the defects in the Maine are due to causes that have
been remedied and it Is somewhat premature to stigmatize
the ship as a "hoodoo."

to his retirement. The Navy Department has ruled that a
midshipman on probation, serving on one of the cruising
vessels of the Naval Academy, was performing war service,

to Machen, Beavers and other?, he with
drew from proceedings as far as the mat
ter of gaining contracts was concerned,
nor did he have any hand 'in the report
ed distribution of stock among the Wash
ington officials. If Erwin did not do this,
who did? Erwin did not realize that he
was receiving his shares out of the 1000
claimed to have been set aside for the
promotion of the success of the scheme;
if he had he could not* have seen any evil
There are those in this city who do not
hesitatefto adversely criticize Richard
son's actions in the matter. It is a
fact ythat he went back *. to Wash
ington in November, 1S99, with the in
tention of bringing thÂ« postal device
before the eyes of the Government
and at that time relied upon Er
win's wide acquaintance and favorable
reputation among the officials to become
introduced to them and float his scheme.
Erwin entered into the spirit of the work
with a vim, both through his friendship
for Richardson and v his interest as part
Inventor of the contrivance.
The device once accepted, the letter box
company- thrived. Of the Montague,In
dicator and Letter Box Company, the
first company which controlled the out
put, W. W. Montague - was president.
Then when the company was relncor
porated under its present title, with 40,000
shares, Richardson became its president
and it is stated by smaller stockholders
of the concern that he has received dtvi
dends amounting In the neighborhood of
$(I>00. Erwin, the man who helped perfect
the patent /contrivance and was instru
mental in getting Richardson a favorable
hearing in its interests before the Wash
ington, 1 authorities, was given a blocfe of
600 shares from which he has realized
just â¢ $96. â¢ Now comes his _, indictment,
served on ,the . undoubted testimony of
the Potrero. Factories that are about
to be built there will not be built for tlie
reason that It will be impossible to ship
goods by -the water route. Vessels can
lay in the China Basin and load goods
from neacby. factories provided Sixteenth
street is^ not; closed to heavy travel, if
It is closed a hardship will be worked on
property owners in the Mission^ and Po
trero\and many -blocks of land, how held
on option 'by .manufacturing plants, will
be abandoned."
Since the first shock of the news that
former Superintendent of Special Deliv
ery for San Francisco James W. Erwin
had been Indicted by th-3 Federal Grand
Jury at Washington for alleged conspir
acy to defraud the Government and had
been removed from office, postal officials
and the many friends of Krwin in this
city have been unanimous in expressing
their su*fÂ»r!se and Indignation at the step
of the Eastern judicial body and have
been ready to voice their theories as to
how such action could have been taken.
And there is the persistent query: "Where
is Superintendent Daniel S. Itichardson?"
On August 27 the superintendent of the
San Francisco Postoflice suddenly depart
Â».w for Washington upon an urgent call
â¢from the Fostoiflce Department. Shortly
afterward the Federal Grand Jury for
the District cf, Columbia held an Inves
tigation Into the affairs of the Postal De
vice and Improvement Company, togather
wiih other supposed frauds which were
being perpetrated upon the Government.
The evidence is conclusive that Richard
son, president of the San Francisco Let
ter Box Device Company, was called be
fore the Grand Jury and rnadp to tell
all that he knew about the concern. On
Thursday the Grand Jury made public an
indictment .ugainst James W. Erwin,
among' others. Richardson had then left
Washington. Since that time he has not
been seen.
Friends of the Former
Official Are Strong in
Condemnation.
THINK ERWIN
IS UNJUSTLY
SINGLED OUT
â "From the point where the proposed spur
tracks branch out from the main line
south of Sixteenth street is a distance of
about' 400 feet to the north side of Six
teenth street. 'If the company begins its
spur i tracks north of Sixteenth street it
would be of ; vast to property
owners and manufacturers who propose
locating:; in the Potrero.
- "If the plans of the railroad are allowed
to *,be . carried ; out ' and . Sixteenth . street
practically closed > to i heavy travel, there
will be no chance" for improvements in
"This matter has only come up in the
past twenty-four hours and I do not sup
pose that any of the Supervisors have
been cognizant of the result to property
owners, in the Potrero if the railroad is
granted permission to build a number of
track* across Sixteenth at the point in
dicated on the map. -
WILL WORK GREAT INJURY.
"If the Southern Pacific Company Is al
lowed to build a number of tracks across
Sixteenth street, between Kentucky and
Sixth streets, it will render the Potrero
absolutely valueless for manufacturing
purposes. It will be impossible for teams
heavily laden to cross the tracks and
equally impossible to cross the proposed
bridge over the tracks, on account of the
heavy grade to the bridge~approach.
"The map shows that the spur lines of
the company commence to "fan out' 1 on
the company's property south of. Six
teenth street, thence crossing: the street
mentioned and enter the company's yards
north' of Sixteenth street. If the plans
of the railroad are changed by the StJ*
pervlsors so that the lines will commence
to "fan out" north of Sixteenth street. It
wHl make a > vast difference to property
owners.- It is possible for heavily laden
teams to cross over one or. two tracks,
but when It comes to crossing ( ovet--ten
or more tracks It Is out of the question.
"A large number of manufacturing
plants are to be located in the Mission
and Potrero districts and these will nat
urally do considerable shipping by water,
provided teams can easily travel from
the factories to the, water front.
â¢â¢Sixteenth street is a public highway
and is now open as far ns. Eighth street
and will be graded to the 'water front in
a time. It Is the only natural outlet
for heavy teani3 from the Mission and Po
trero to the water front. Teams cannot
rSuch the bay by Mariposa or Solano
streets, which are riouth of -Sixteenth
street, as these streets cross high hills. -
water front and that products of facto
ries will have to be shipped by the rail
road and not by the cheaper and compet
ing water haul. ,
In Its application for the bay / 3hore
franchise the Southern Pacific Company
agrees to build a brid?e over Sixteenth
street, between Kentucky and Sixth
streets, the grade to the approach to the
bridge not to exceed C per cent.
WAGO1JS MUST CLIMB GRADE.
The use of th's graded approach to the
bridge will be impossible for heavy teams
and only foot passengers and light wag
ons will be ableyto travtl from the Po
trero to Central Basin on the water front.
The section of the proposed bay shore
ordinance, referring to sidetracks, spur
tracks and connecting trae'es. says that
the railroad shall be empowered to "croa3
Sixteenth street diagonally, west of the
west line cf Kentucky street." and fur
ther says, "snid running thence northerly
and easterly acres?. Sijct'xr.th street, be
tween Sixth street and Kentucky street,
with ten or more single tracks. Into the
yards and property of^said company."
A well-known citizen and property own
er. In speaking of the proposed bay shore
franchise, said yesterday :
"If the Southern Paclficj Company is
granted the right to lavy a number of
spur tracks across Sixteenth, street, be
tween "Kentucky and Sixth streets, it will
practically close Sixteenth street to all
heavy teams that may desire to reach the
water front from the M:ssion s*id Po
trero. The railroad. company owns con
siderable property in "that district. The
map shows that It owns th? blocks bound
ed by Pennsylvania. Mariposa, Kentucky
and Sixteenth streets. On these blocks
the car repairt shops are to be located.
The companyHuso owns the blocks bound
ed by Sixteenth, Kentucky. Fourth, Chan
nel and Sixth streets. The Supervisors
have closed a number of streets at the
request of the railroad company and
there has been but little objection from
the property owners.
UNABLE TO BEACH THE BAY.
THE ordinance for the proposed
bay shore line of the Southern Pa
cific Railroad will come up before
the Board of Supervisors to-Uay
and ft is not likely to be adopted
without a protest from mary property
owners in the and Potrcro dis
tricts.
The Street Committee of the Supervis
ors held a ?r^cial nrfeetingr last Saturday
for the purpose of drafting the ordinance
which, with a few exceptions. Is similar
to the wetltion for the franchise filed by
the railroad company.
According to a prominent real or.tate
man there fa B "joker" of magnitude in
tho railroad's application for the bay
shore franc'iise ar.d the intention of the
railroad is to cut off competition by water
from any business that may be located
in the future in the Mission and Po-Â»*ero
districts.
A glance at the map filed with the rail
road's application for ihe bay shore
franchise shows that a number of spur
tracks are to cross Sixteenth street be
tween Kentucky and Sixth streets. If
these are built it is said that all egress
from the Mission and Potrero manufac
turing districts will be cut off from the
MAP OF THE POTRERO SHOWING A NETWORK OF TRACKS THAT THE SOUTHERN PACIFIC RAIL
ROAD WILL CONSTRUCT AT THE CROSSING OF SIXTEENTH STREET IF THE REQUISITE PERMIS
SION IS SECURED, PRACTICALLY CLOSING THAT THOROUGHFARE.

/ " Dear Mrs. Pinkham : â TheTe are but few wires and mothers who
have not at times endured agonies and such pain as only women know.
I wish such women knew the value of Lydla 13. Pinkh&m's Vegetable
Compound. It is a remarkable medicine, different in action from any
I ever knew and thoroughly reliable.
" I have seen cases where women doctored for years without perma-
nent benefit, who were cured in less than three months after taking your
Vegetable Compound, while others who were chronic and incurable
came oiit cured, happy, and in perfect health after a thorough treatment
with this medicine. I have never used it myself without gaining great
benefit. A few doses restores^ my strength and appetite, and tones up
the entire system. Your medicine has been tried and found true, hence
I fully endorse it." â Mrs. R. A- A2rc>ER3ox, 225 "Washington St- Jack*

druff is the cause of all trouble with hair.
It Is a germ disease. The germ makes

game was one of the most interesting of

Morris' delivery, although two \ hits of
a decidedly scratchy nature were scored
against him. In the, eighth Inning, how
ever, the Senators became accustomed to
his delivery, bunched four hits and scored
three runs. This broke the Ice, and as
two more runs were scored in the ninth it

playing of the locals waa as unlike their work
of yesterday as it well could be. They fielded,
ran bases and batted in championship form,
while San Francisco's patched-up field was
weak inr both respects. Lindsey was taken out

SUMMARY.
Both Dr. MoaWman and Jimmy St.
Vraln were about right In the morning
game across the bay. For ten innings
the two pitchers battled fiercely and held
the opposing batsmen at their mercy.
The Cripples got their only run during
the progress of the second inning and the
Seattles created a deadlock in the third,
which remained unbroken until the end.
Oakland had a good chance to win out in
the tenth, when with two on bases and as
many out Gorton came to the bat. He
failed to make good, however, so it was
all off and Levy called the game so that
the players would arrive at Recreation
Park in time for the second contest. The
score:

masterly pitching.
'Twas an exhibition of bad baseball the
multitude had to face at the Eighth-street
lot. From the third inning on the Â£ame
belonged to the Cripples. The other men
played as though they would never have
a license to win another game aa long as
they lived. When they did secure a
chance to take a brace they refused to
act, so no one but thempelveu can should
er the blame. Zinssar and Parke Wilson
let In a bunch of runs.
The Cripples opened the game with a
little vim. O'llara smashed out a nice
bingle and Francks sacrlnc?d. Then Dev
ereaux took the kinks out of one of Bar
ber's twister** and Willie landed at the
rubber. In the third the Cripples sud
denly became so strong that they broke
up the game.
Graham, the first man up, waa passed.
O'Hara came through with another drive
to center. Francks forced Graham at
third and O'Hara landed on second.
Devereuux soused out another blngle and
O'Hara scampered hi. Schwartz walked,
lllling the cushions.* Murdock then took
a ride on a fast one and away It went
out to Zlnssar. The sight of so 1 many
young men on a mad stampede over the
sacks seemed., to take all the right out
of the latter. He booted the ball and
then threw it away at the plate. The
whole bunch touched the plate and Mur
dock got as far as third. Messerly con
t.nued the good work by banging out
another one to center. This let Mur
dock In with the fifth run.
In the fifth Graham began to ascent
gently into the loftier regions and the
Seattleites had a swell chance to gel
into the going for about ten runs. But
they were not there.
Buck Francks played one of hla old
time games at short and made one 8top
that was the real cream cheese for
brightness and spectacular effect. There
were runners on first and second and
two out, in the fifth, when the Seattles
threatened to start something. Zinssar
caught one of Graham's speedy twisters
at the end of his bat and It begun to
take a trip out over the infield. ' Francks
made a stab for the ball with his un
gloved mitt, and ere the mob had a
chance to say a word he speared it and
saved the two runners the ,â¢ trouble of
making the trip to the plate. The score:
THE Cripples are in the game for
keeps. That was demonstrated
yesterday when they got away
with all, the glory. They refused
to be beaten. In the morning
they managed to stall off the Seattles and
quit with ihe score 1 to'l at the end of
the tenth round. While the multitude
rooted for the northern bunch at Recrea
tion Park in the afternoon, the Cripples
kept up their two-minute gait and bagged
the game, 11 to 5. .
They took five games out of seven from
Wilson's gathering during the week.
Eight games â¢were played, one resulting
In a tie. The Seattle men only copped
two and Hughes won both of these by his
OAKLAND'S FAST LEFT FIELDER, WHOSE PHENOMENAL CATCHES HAVE MADE HIM A FAVORITE WITH
THE FANS, AND PARKE WILSON'S NEW PITCHER, WHO APPEARED AT RECREATION PARK YESTER
DAY FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS SEASON.

in Gravesend. The entries In all races se,t
for excision except that for the First Spe
oal are exceedingly attractive. To the
treat surprise of many, the crack three
>ear-olds engaged in this stake are not
likely to start. Irish h^d and The Picket
Â¦were both exj>ectod to take paxt in the
race, and it may be that one or both may
>et run, although it Is, of course, possi
ble that thtlr respective trainers have
positively decided that they will not run
in this particular event. This is distinctly
<l*sapiÂ«>Jtitir:g to many thousands. It is
Blze a curious fact that ail three of the
probable starters are graduates of the
Wesiern turf, and that one of them. Sher
iff l>ell, ran part of one winter at New
OKean*. It "Is possible the erstwhile de
eplaed McCbesney has IntlmUlkted all
Â«.>?her cracks from starting.
There is, however, plenty of material
in all the other race:? to make up to some
Â« xtent for the small fie'.d in the Kirst Spe
< ial. The regulars were proclaiming- all
cay that Leonidas would win the Junior
Champion for W. C. Whitney and thus
< omper^ate him for h!s defeat in the
Futurity. With only 110 pounds on his
1 a.k it Is difficult for students of form
to pick a coit or filly to defeat the gal
l.itit son of Hamburg.
Thrre will be action enough In the
FjuinE: handicap, which will lead off the
day's racing, and with pome excellent ma
tfrial in ihe steeplechase it ie quite pos
f--'ble that the spectators will bo regaled
with a repetition of the Fplendid ?te<-ple
<hitfe run on Saturday at Sneepshead
Bay.
AÂ« has boen ihe case ever since Mc-
Chesney came EaFt, comment on the new
<;ravesÂ«>nti meeting turns upon the possi
bility of a meeting between "Big Mac"
and Waterboy. Ixnh as they are to con
<cde that anything that comes out of the
West mijrht have sufficient class to take
the measure of the best of the Eastern
thoroughbreds. metropolitan turfg-oers
without exception admit that Waterboy is
the one horse racing hereabout? that has
a ch8nce to beat Smathers' superb thor
oughbred. In the past several months
certain Eastern turf writers wtrÂ«? prone
to Fneer at McChesney and to intimate
that the accident that prevented his
match with Waterboy was exaggerated in
the r>yes of h!s owner and trainer for very
pood reasons of their own. Now the situ
ation has changed, and Waterboy will
lose his following: Sf his owner shirks a
meeting with McChesney.
The popularity which McChesney has
attained pince his victory in the Twin
City handicap is remarkable, in view of
the contumely that was heaped upon the
Western champion previous to that race
and of thp fact that Â«ldom does a WVst
<rn animal become a turf hero in the eye*
Of Easterners. Only a week ago one turf
writer suppested that the new pea rfm
r.cquired by one of the park museum? be
named McChesney because of her lumber
ing uncouthness, while another facetious.
l.v called Owner Smathers' attention to a
vacancy in the motive power of a city
irarbage wagon.

On the park courts thorp wa3 also a
special march. Clarence Griffin, who re
cently graduated from the second clasp,
and Clarence Ko.ey, a second class man,
were the contestant*. Foley contended
that he had as much right in the first
class as Griffin, and a match was ar
ranged. l r oley's victory in straight seta
justified his claim, and a committee has
been appointed to decide whether he,,
should go into the first class or whether'
Griffin should be put back into the sec
ond. The latter course will probably bo
pursued. In the last two tournaments at
San Rafael Griffin showed remarkably
we:i, and his defeat at the hands of the
fast-improving Foley was quite a sur
prise. The score was Câ 3. 11â9.

The best ruati-h in doubles was that In
which Drummond MacGavln and Harry
llalght won time sets from Frank Mitch
ell and Vk'. S. Mac-Gavin.
The following matches were played:
Of the five sets played four went up to
d*uce and three of them were exception
ally lone. In the third it became neces
sary to play twenty-five games. The
scoie, in l,o:)g's favor, was 7â5, 3â6, 13â11,
eâ g. $s.
la the third and fourth sets lxmt: h-td a
lead of 5â2. lie managed to*" win the
third, but lost the fourth. The fifth and
deciding *et waa the most exciting of the
eerie?. Long" won the first two games.
Keyfuas won the next four, anu led at
49â 0 In the seventh, which he losÂ«t. The
latter was within a point of winning the
match eleven times in the tenth game,
when the score stood 5â4 in his favor.
After having vantage five times Long
made it games all and then won out.
The feature on the club courts was a
special match between Herbert Lone and
Alexander Beyfuss. Considerable rivalry
exists between theBe promising young
players, and neither would admit the su
periority of the other. That there Is little
to choose b^wtrn them the match played
yesterday proves conclusively. It waa a

1\ ; TO HIS FINAL BEST
Coney Island, at the beach, is rapidly
becoming one of the leading Sunday at
tractions of the city, and the increase in
patronage yesterday was marked. For
many hours hundreds of people passed
through the gates, visited concessions and
found much enjoyment In the open-air
vaudeville programme, which is presented
by clever artists. A lion, one of the most
graceful ever seen here, has been ac
quired by the management and attracted
attention all day.
Professor "Billy" Vosmer made a most
thrilling balloon ascension. He rose in
the direction of the clouds many hundred
feet and executed many daring antics on
a trapeze. A new balloon specialty is be
ing prepared for next Sunday.
On the vaudeville programme are Musa
La Var, serio-comic buck and wing
dancer: Oro and Oro, a rough-and-tumble
sketch team; Eddie Dolan, the "man
from Ireland,** and several other people
whose talent is pronounced.
The management will make extensive
Improvements during the coming week
anfl is acting on every suggestion that
wtll be conducive to the comfort and
pleasure of the public.
Murphy said, however, five other con
victs would have killed one of the num
ber who should have weakened In case
the guards had fired He said Dr. Plant,
the prison physician, was badly scared
and threw his hands in the air and ran
In and out of the barber shop aimlessly.
He intimated that five other officers were
also more or less frightened.
Murphy said that while he* was in ti.e
brush near Lake Tahoe eighteen of his
pursuers sassed not more than two feet
from his hiding place. After they had
gone he entered a house and robbed It of
$19. He said on one occasion he rode in
a buggy with a Nevada deputy sheriff
and played cards with him and another
officer without exciting their suspicions.
Murphy eald it was his intention to pro
ceed to his old home In Pennsylvania,
have his present filled teeth pulled out
and a "false se.t inserted /and remain In
that State secure from detection. He
would express no opinion concerning the
whereabouts of Miller and the other con.
vlcts.
Murphy said to-night that getting away
from Folsom Prison is the easiest thing
In the world. He was surprised that more
breaks for liberty were not made there.
He was asked what would have been the
result if the guards had been allowed to
open fire on the thirteen escaping, con
victs who had taken the Warden, the
captain of the guard and several of the
guards of the prison as shields.
"If the guards had been allowed to
fire," said Murphy, "it weuld have been
a very different story. There was plenty
of opportunity. There were times when
a prisoner was twenty-five feet away from
an officer and the guards could have
opened fire without hurting an officer.
Why. it would have been a hundred-to
one shot for the guards to have fired."

son cits*.
The sudden departure of Johnson and
the woman has furnished a basis for sen
ratlonal reports that the two were in
seme manner responsible for the taking
off of Calvin, and it is chiefly because of
tbis allegation that the officers have made
a special effort to apprehend them.
Several months ago Calvin was taken
ill and died very soon afterward.
Johnson was the physician In at
tendance, and It is said that he paid con
siderable attention to the wife during the
serious sickness of her husband.
After the death of Calvin the physician
and the widow were much in each other's
company. Their departure was entirely
unexpected and the people of Overton
were shocked because Johnson held a lu
crative and responsible position at the
mills and was a prominent figure In the.
social life of Ovcrton. He had a bright
and Interesting family, and to all appear
ances was an attentive and devoted hus
band and father.

WILL CELEBRATE
INDEPENDENCE
Judge Cabaniss was greeted with cheers
and applause. He likened the Democratic
party to the vestal virgins, for the reason
that they always had their, lights burn
ing. They were always on fhe spot and
would eventually win out! the principles
they were fighting for. '
The festivities closed bv the entire com*
pany singing the national anthem, '"The
Star Spangled Banner."
A. A. Bailey of Martinez said that he
was an Abraham Lincoln Republican, but
since the days of that great liberator he
had become a Democrat:
Judge James O. Maguire upheld the
Jt-ffersonian Democracy in a forceful
manner and took for his subject "Equal
rights to all. special privileges to none."
James H. Barry in the course of h's
talk referred to the recent action of the
State Board of Equalization. He han
dled the actions of that body without
gloves.
Walker C. Graves .stated that the dor
mant vice in politics was greed.
The feast was served at tables arranged
some distance apart, on a sloping hill,
over which towered lofty redwoods based
by a wealth of woodland foliage. The
tables were laden with edibles of every
kind and description, while the choice
vintages of California's finest products
were everywhere in evidence-
Music, both vocal and \ instrumental,
adOTQ much to the enjoyment of this oc
casion. When the gastronomical portion
of the entertainment had been thorough
ly discussed, speechmaklng became the
order of the day.
J. C. Gorman acted as chairman of the
occasion and introduced the different
speakers in a happy manner.
James V. Coleman made a short and
felicitous talk upon the- subject of the
trinityâ the trinity on this occasion being
composed of the stomach, heart and
brain. His remarks called forth great
applause.
William M. Cannon in the course of his
speech gave a rap at President Rooeevelt
on the subject of the "trust problem,"
and inferred that It was a lack of moral
courage that prevented officials ,/from
carrying out what they really knew to be
the right and honest administration of
Government affairs.
The Iroquois Club celebrated the twen
tieth anniversary of Its organization yes
terday by giving a bull's head breakfast
at Larkspur in Redwoods Grove. It was
a great success in every way. The day
was fine and the attendance large. The
twenty-two bull heads, which were do
nated by Jefferson G. James, were cooked
to the "king's taste," and were adjudged
by the epicureans present to be the very
acme of culinary art. At any rate they
disappeared like ice before the blazing
sun.
John Chetwood. G. W. Sutton and Dr.
Luce, the three disappointed treasure
hunters who rt turned with Capta'n Brown
on the Mariposa. made no secret on Sat
urdny that the chargt-s of assault were
made more for the purpose of holding
the aged mariner in cuttody than with
any Idea cf securing a conviction. They
have other and more serious charges to
prefer, they say, but will not be in a
position to make their application for a
Â¦warrant until after consultation with the
others of the people who contributed the
JSft.OOQ invested in the fortune quest.
Meanwhile they depend upon the assault
charge ard the City Prison to hold the
captain until they are reads*.
The arrest was made by the representa
tive of a private detective agency. As
sault on the high seas is *a felony, and as
the bail where a crime of such degree is
charged is high Captain Brown Is confined
In the City Prison.
The captain denies having at any time
maltreated the complainant, and declares
that nothing more serious than SDlte in
spired his arrest. The real complainants,
he declares, are the men who failed to
find the treasure and who are holding him
responsible for the fruits gathered from
their own folly. The captain takes his
arrest philosophically and declares that in
a few days he will be on his way to his
home. Auburn. R. I., where he will organ
ise a party of men he can trust and with
them sail for the South Seas and gather
the harvest of yellow metal his former
shipmates might have picxed had their
trust in James Brown been more Implfclt.
The men that failed to find the $50,
000,000 treasure In the South Seas found a
way yesterday to begin the operation of
getting back at the ancient mariner whose
rainbow yarn was the cause of their
tribulation. Captain James Brown, late of
the treasure-hunting schooner Herman,
was arrested yesterday as he was leaving
the ticket office at the ferry depot with
two tickets for Oakland in his possession.
He was arrested on five charges of as
sault committed while on the high seas
on the person of R. Karishina, the Her
man's steward. ..;'
Fisher jumped and just as he did so
Blake fired. The first shot missed Fish
er, but Blake fired again and Fisher fell
with a bullet through his right lung.
Blake walked out of the place and went
home, where he was later placed under
arrest. He refuses to make any state
ment. He was taken to Barstow and
lodged in jail. - x
LOS AXGELES. Sept. 13.â Henry Fish
er, aged 26 years, unmarried, agent for
the Santa Fe Railroad at Kramer, San
Bernardino County, was brought to Los
Angeles this morning suffering from a
gunshot wound through the right lung,
from which the physicians say he cannot
recover. He was shot at that desert
town at 6 o'clock Saturday night by John
Blake, postmaster at Kramer, and there
being no physician there, the wounded
man was placed aboard a special train
and taken to Barstow, where he Â¦was
placed on board an overland train and
brought to Los Angeles.
Fisher's story of the shooting Is that
he and Blake had a quarrel over some
trivial matter about three weeks ago, but
he did not regard it as at all serious and
the trouble had not been renewed. Satur
day evening, while Fisher was washing
his hand?, Blake entered the Santa Fe
depot and demanded that Fisher produce
certain papers, the nature of which Fish
er did not state. He was told to wait a
moment, and while Fisher continued
washing he heard a gun snap behind him
and tnrned to find himself covered with a
revolver in the hands of Blake.

Clay & Co.'s for the symphony concert
to be given to-morrow" afternoon at the
Grand Opera-house by Fritz Scheel and
his superb orchestra. The programme is
the choicest of all that have been given
thus far and includes among other excep
tional numbers selections from Richard
Wagner's great "Parsifal." which will be
heard here for the first time. Then there
Is -the famous Brahm'fi No. 2 Symphony,
that will be given by request. andXthere
is also Mendelssohn'* beautiful "Midsum
mer NiSht's Dream" and a number of
surprises from the eminent director, llr.
Scbeel who promises this concert to be
the acme of them all. Much interest is
attached to the performance of the "Par-
Bifal" selections, aÂ« San Francisco is the
first city in America that will be honored
with this music.
Many new and unique acts in the vau
deville line are offered at the Chutes
Theater this week, beginning to-night.
â¢ ;â¢-.â¢"Â¦â¢
"The Cherry Pickers' is on the 1 boards
at thÂ« Central Theater for the coming
week, beginning with this evening's per
formance.
"Even-man" will be given for the last
times the coming week, beginning to
right, at Lyric Hall.
â¢ . â¢
"The Con-curers" and "The Glad
Hand" form the attractions offered at
Fischer's Theater for the week beginning
this evening.
Florence Roberts will appear in
"Magda" at the Alcazar Theater this
week, beginning to-night.
"II -Trovatore" will be sung at the
Tivoil Opera-house on Monday. Wednes
day, Friday and Saturday evenings of
this week and "La Sonnambula" is the
programme for Tuesday. Thursday and
Saturday matinee.
Henry Miller and Margaret Anglin will
produce "The Aftermath" at the Colum
bia Theater this week, beginning to-night.
"A Friend of the Family," with Alice
Johnson and George W. Barnum, will be
continued at the California Theater dur
ing the' week commencing this evening.
"The I^aJy Slavey" was presented last
night at the Grand OpTa-houpe by the
Pollard Lilliputian Opera Company and
packed houÂ«=e was fortunate enough to
greet the little ones' presentation of this
niÂ«->?t laughable of musical skits. The
same piece will be given for the next
three r.'ghts.
If one bÂ« suffering from ennui and the
reaction that comes cf much theater at
tendance there can be no better cure than
to witness the performance at the Grand.
To say that the little ones equal com
panies of greater renown and more years
!s doing thrm scant justice. In freshness,
musical ability, thorough training and
bright stage work they far excel xno.^t
organizations that nightly pack the large
theaters cf the country. They are a rev
elation of what natural ability and excep
tional training can do with children of
tender cge. Entire absence of self-con
sciousness and a complete conception of
their various parts characterize Â¦ their
work.
It seems almost invidious to single out
particular characters where all do so
well, but undoubtedly Master Teddy Mc-
Namara and Miss Merle Pollard, tots
scarcely in their teens, made the hit of
the night when they appeared as the
"Bowery boy and girl." The audience
will tmile for days over the picture they
presented*. Daphne Â¦ Pollard, as Phyllis,
the lady slavey, was so precociously de
lightful that every one fell in love with
her. Jack Pollard was -wonderfully good
in the comical part cf Roberts. Alice.
Ivy and Fred Pollard added interesting
musical and terpsichorean features to
the performance. Grown folk as well as
children should not miss the Pollards. J
Princess I>o*oros, an East Indian, who
was born In Calcutta and whose voice
was trained jn both Germany and France,
becomes more than a favorite as a prirr.a.
Â«lonna soprano. Her voice Is of the col
o.rattire order, much as Melha's, and poÂ«=
ressps a softness and sweetness that is
entrancing. In many of the cadenzes the
princess' note? are so pure and flexible
that It was almost impossible to distin
truifh her voice from the flute ih.it ac
companies her. Her first number was B
theme and variations from Proch: her sre
ond. "Ixj. Hear the Gentle Lark." by
Bishop, in which the flute oblicato was
played by Antone Lcgar. As a closing
rong ch*> rendered "Violets." and in a
manner that won her many encores ami
Insured for her a welcome ever in this
city.
James Richard Glenroy. "the man with
the green gloves." brought out one con
tinuous laugh and handed his stuff to his
listeners at the pace of a rapid-fire gun.
His gags and speeches are all new and
he is we'-l received. Arnesen is a won
derful eaui'ibrist and acrobat. He does
work on a rope that has not been Sfen
h<-rr before and is a king pin In his line.
Almont and Dumont. Fischer and Wacker,
Frederick Bond and company and the
rriginal Rio brothers complete the show.
The first brings out La Porte, or main
entrance to the exposition, and the sec
ond. "L* Villiage Sulese." opens with a
beautiful scene of a Swiss hamlet on the
shores of a mountain lake. By the clever
manipulation of switches by two women
who eland at either end of the stage day
fades Into night, clouds flake the sky.
Then Increase In volume and gradually a
tempest arises. Rain pelts down and
lightning flashes. After the sky clears
the flrn rays of the sun are seen on the
distant crags and day dawns and the sun
rises In a manner most realistic. The
third tableau consists cf experiments In
Â« "Hail of Illusions." Suspended above
the stage, drums beat and mechanical
birfis. chirp and sing to an orchestral ac
companiment. In the fourth the beauties
of a night festival on "L* Champs Mars"'
hold the si>ectators In wonder.
" Kousby presents the most marvelous
<* C:rlCal noveltr ever seen on the Pa
cific Coast at the Orpheum this week. A
description en paper sufficient to enable
one to appreciate :ts beauty and wonder
would be impossible. The splendcr In
light and color that responds to the touch
of fingers on a switchboard can only be
realized when Been and the effects bring
the audience face to face with a picture
r < interest and serming magic. The act
consists of an electrical review In four
tableaux, showing the best features of
Parisian life during the exposition of
1900.

The little schooner Viking, which ar
rived yesterday, seventeen days from
Dutch Harbor, brought a large collec
tion of valuable furs gathered by hunt
ers and trappers in the tax north. The
furs In their present condition are valued
at more than $13,000, and include the
skins of many different species of ani
mal. Probably the most valuable part of
the consignment is a bundle of thirty
seven sea otter skins. Securing the furs
Involved tho sacrifice of many animal
lives, the victims ranging from cinnamon
bears to white rabbits. There are skins
of mink, lynx, beaver, red and white fox,
bears, black, white, cinnamon and griz
zly, and otter. The Viking's cargo also
Includes a little ivory.
The Viking left here May 4 with $36,000
worth of supplies for the mission stations
located around Kushakwim Bay. A
scow. 40 feet long. 10 feet wide and 8 feet
In depth, was taken up on the Viking's
deck. During a heavy gale this scow
got loose from Its moorings and was
saved from going overboard with consid
erable difficulty. "While adrift the heavy
scow did considerable damage about tEe
schooner's deck.
After discharging her furs the Viking
will go to Grays Harbor* to load lumber.
Consignment Includes Pelts
of Sea Otter and Oin
namon Bear.

west-bound Harrison-street trolley car.
He was sent to the Emergency Hospital

and a punctured wound on the inside of
the right leg. He claims the motorman
of the car, 1007, did not ring his bell when

Ran Into by a Trolley Car.
SALINAS, Sept. 13.â Further search of
the premises occupied by James Daugh
erty at the First and Last Chance saloon,
charged with being concerned in the rob
bery of freight trains, revealed sufficient
hides, groceries, liquors and other goods
to more than fill a freight car. The pris
oner still states that he was not one of
the principals, but simply acted as a fence",
and has to-day Informed the officers of
two other caches. He refuses to tell how
the goode were delivered, but as the rear
portion of his house is only fifty feet from
the main track and only twenty from the
outhouses, it is suspected that the goods
were thrown oft en route and picked up
by Daugherty and his confederates. He
is not confined with the other prisoners,
but is in the old jail, and from his ac
tions the Sheriff thinks he will soon
break down and make a full confession,
giving names, etc. There . are several
horse traders, so-called, encamped near
the saloon and upon its grounds, who are
under surveillance, as it is said they may
be implicated. Sheriff Nesbitt this after
noon went to Watsonville upon informa
tion that the men who escaped when
Daugherty was arrested had been seen
near there on horseback. Investigations
are being made as to how the stolen
goods were disposed of and officers say
startling developments may soon be
locked for.
More Goods Are Found and Prisoner
Is Weakening.
DAUGHERTY MAY CONFESS.
OPERATE MANY MONTHS.
' According to the authorities the gang
had been operating since last October on
freight trains after leaving Salinas, and
THE story of a systematic looting
of Southern Pacific freight cars
and the arrest and confession of
: W. H, Daugherty at Salinas, as
published exclusively in The Call
of yesterday, resulted in developing the
fact that two men suspected of complic
ity in the robberies and implicated by
Daugherty's confession have been in the
custody of the' local police since last
Thursday. They are C. A. Rutherford, a
brakeman on the Southern Pacific run
ning between here and Salinas, and C. V.
Graves, a marine fireman and a member
of the Stevedores' Union. The former is
held In the City Prison and the latter Is
guarded at the City and County Hospital,
suffering from blood poisoning as a result
of an injury received, according to
Daugherty, while jumping from the last
freight car that they robbed. The police
are looking for Frank Carey,- another ste
vedore, who has managed to evade arrest.
Rutherford when seen at the City Pris
on yesterday denied complicity in the rob
beries. He admitted, knowing Graves and
Carey, but said his acquaintance with
them was slight. Â«He said they had never
ridden on his train to his knowledge. He
denied knowing Daugherty.
Lewin left for Salinas yesterday after
noon and to-day will swear to complaints
charging , Daugherty, Rutherford, Graves
and, Carey with committing ' two burglar
ies, one on July 15 and the other on Aug
ust 15.
Other thefts discovered by Detective
Lewin were forty sacks of barley, which
were sold to a grain dealer named Fland
er in Salinas, and a case containing 42,000
cigarettes, which was so'.d to a^dgar
dealer named Harball in Salinas. Lewin
says that when Harball learned that the
detectives knew where the stolen cigar
ettes could be found 1 they, were thrown
into a fire and consumed.
After â¢ Daugherty made his confession
Lewin and Kindelon came to this city and
with, the assistance of Ryan arrested
Rutherford that night as he was about to
leave on! his train. Graves was found in
the City and County Hospital: It is al
leged that after looting the car on August
15 Graves in jumping from if fell and
broke the bones of his left thumb. He
neglected to have the thumb attended to,
and now his left hand and arm are badly
swollen. A policeman is keeping a watch
on .him at the hospital. Carey has not
yet been arrested. .
ACCUSED MEN ARRESTED.
When Daugherty was arrested last
Thursday he made a written confession
implicating Rutherford, Graves and
Carey. Graves lived with Rutherford's
mother-in-law, and when looting was to
be done it is charged that Rutherford
would take Graves and Carey on his train
to do the work after the train left Sa
linas. Graves and Carey lived most of
the time at Daugherty' s house near Sa
linas.
It was also discovered that two cases of
toys consigned to the -California Notion
and Toy Company of this city, which had
been stolen from a car on July 15, had
been shipped from Salinas to" this city- the
following day and had been sold to the
Solomonson-Hartman-Solomon Company,
dealers in merchandise at 106 Third street.
They had been shipped as dry goods by
Graves,, under the name of Brown, to
Brown in San Fr.ancisco. The original
cases had been destroyed and the toys
packed into two cigar 'cases, stolen pre
viously. The two cases of toys were re
covered by Lewin, Klndelon and Ryan
last week in the basement of 1109 McAl
lister street, occupied by the Solomonson-
Hartman-Solomon Company.
STOLEN TOYS EECOVERED.
the value of the poods stolen since that
time will it is estimated run into thou
sands of dollars. It is believed to be the
same gang that stole the cigars that were
sold to Max Katzauer, a cigar dealer at
Third and Townsend streets, who is
awaiting trial in the Superior Court on a
charge of receiving stolen property.
Detective Lewin of the Southern Pacific
was detailed on the case about three
months aeo, and after working for some
time in the neighborhood of Salinas De
tective Patrick Kinde'.on of the Southern
Pacific and Sheriff Nesbitt .of Salinas
were called to assist. Detective Sergeant
T. L. Ryan of the local police department
was detailed to help in locating the local
members of the gang.
It was ascertained by the offlcres that
Daugherty had rented a house on the
Castroville road about a mile from Sali
nas in April last and that he acted as a
"fence" for the thieves. The last car that
was looted was on August 15. From it
were taken five cases of eggs, a box of
butter, a chest of tea, a bale of matting,
a center table, a desk, a box of books, a
draper, a box of personal effects and a
bundle of dry pelts. A visit was made
by the officers to the house occupied by
Daugherty last Thursday, and all of these
articles were recovered except the cases
of eggs and the box of butter. The eggs
had been sold to a Japanese in Salinas
and the j butter . had been destroyed.
Daugherty having been notified by some
one that the officers were to pay his place
a visit.
The final performances of Ringling
Bros.* attraction will take place in this
city this afternoon and evening, and at
midnight to-night the big tent will come
down and the aggregation will proceed to
Alameda, where two performances will
take place to-morrow. On Wednesday the
circus will be seen al San Jose.
Two vast audiences packed the tent of
Ringllng Bros.' circus yesterday afternoon
and evening, and hundreds of people were
unable to even secure admission at the
night presentation.
The splendid bill of entertainment de
lighted young and old alike, and the col
lection of wild animals had the usual
crowds of sightseers around the cag-es.
The three-day-old baby lions were the
center of attraction, and the addition to
the zoo proved a veritable drawing card.
The many thousands of visitors to the
circus in the past week have been unan
imous that the attraction is the best! of
Its kind ever seen on this coast, and the
vast sums of money taken in by the man
agement prove that the public has been
well satisfied.

Before you go home
WTH the issuance of the October number, now on the
news-Sands, is answered squarely the question of
supremacy among the magazines for woman and home.
In your selection of a magazine you may choose from two
classesâ those you need and those you read for recreation â
or else you take THE DELINEATOR and combine both.
If the word "necessary" is susceptible of a superlative, THE
DELINEATOR is beyond all question the "most necessary"
of all the magazines published for Woman.
Nine hundred thousand families proved this to be so last
month; and each month brings its new thousands of members
into the ever-growing DELINEATOR FAMILY.
Among the fashions it is the "most necessary" because it is
all the fashion magazines in one, with their mistakes eliminated
â their exaggerations corrected, and the really successful novel-
ties stamped with the seal of authoritative approval â for if it is
pictured in THE DELINEATOR it is "good form." It is
equally the "most necessary" in the Nursery, in the Sewing-
Room, in the Kitchen â throughout the whole house and out of
doors in city and in country.
THE PARTIAL LIST.; OF CONTENTS BELOW
can only hint at the interest underlying every line : â
The Evolution of a Club Woman, by Agnes Surbridge, begins in this number. It is
Â«a autobiography and is the predided success of the year. CJ J. C. Hemment, the
world-lamed earner* expert, begins one of the most remarkable series of photographic
articles ever presented. They relate to his personal adventures at home and in foreign
lands. <JThe Silent Partner, by Lynn Roby Meekins ; A Florida Cracker, by Virginia
Frazer Boyle, are prominent among the fiction features, while the departments are fuller
than usual of good things, with especial interest centring in the children's pages.
If the "most necessary" of the magazines for, Woman is that
one which helps most in every hour of "her" day and brings its
after-hour of fascinating leisure-rejading when the day is over,
then, surely. "JUST GET THE^DELINEATOR ." Of
