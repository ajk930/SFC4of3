announce an agreement with Russia-
ST. PETERSBURG, Dec. 8.â Peace
between Russia' and Japan Is now be
lieved to be assured as the result of the
action of the Czar at Tsarskoe Selo,
where he and Foreign Minister Lams
dorf have considered the reply to the
Japanese proposals. If Japan is will
ing to accept some modifications, there
is nothing to stand in the way of a
complete agreement.
The conference lasted an hour and a
half, during which certain modifications
of Japan's proposals relative to Korea
were decided upon. These were Imme
diately cabled to Baron de Rosen, the
Russian Minister to Japan, and Admi
ral Alexieff, the Russian Viceroy in the
Far East. The latter probably will lay
them informally before the_' Japanese
negotiators in Tokio. The modifications
are said to be of minor Importance.
The convention will cover only Korea,'
Russia acknowledging Japan's predom
inating Influence with the right to pro
tect it.

RIVALS FOB SUPREMACY IN THE ORIENT. WHO ARE NBARING A
SOLUTION OF DISPUTES THAT, HAVE THREATENED TO IN
VOLVE THEIR COUNTRIES IN WAR. : '
There Is no doubt that the naval au
thorities took into consideration* the
moral, effect 'on the Colombian -Govern
ment of the establishment of a marine
camp at' Empire/
The; report' of , the movement of .3000
soldiers from Cartagena ' for the pur-^
pose of Invading the isthmus cannot be
confirmed. Rumors of such move
ments may be looked for, particularly
as the people, of 'the isthmus are more
or less excited by the precautionary
measures adopted by the /United
States. \ General Huertas is ; about to
establish a^ small, garrison: for 'the
troops of the new Republic, at Yavlsa,
a town at the head, of San Miguel Bay,
on the Pacific side, of the isthmus.'^
"If. a body of Colombian troops should
succeed in obtaining a/ foothold In the
rich ChiriquI district, .it is generally
conceded that, after predatory raids on
the country side,. theyjlwould retreat to
the mountain fastnesses; from which
it would be most" difficult to" dislodge
them. '
It is considered significant that the
point selected for the. encampment of
the Dixie's marines, while it is the
highest and best.^so far as sanitary
conditions are j concerned, on the line
of the Panama Railroad,, it Is also on
the trail most frequently used .In the
past for the, movement of troops over
land from *fhe Cauca district Into the
Chlrlqui district. '
TO SHUT OUT COLO3IBIAXS.
The actual purpose of the .United
States Government in landing the ma
rines, however,- is believed to be con
nected with the precautionary meas
ures now being .carried out. on both
sides of the isthmus, and, per
haps, also for the moral effect which
the landing of the marines may have
on the native garrison at Panama,*, the
loyalty of which, though hitherto ab
solutely unswerving,' ; has been ques
tioned in. some c quarters, especially
since the discovery of , the plot against
the life of General Huertas, commander
in chief of the forces* of the republic of
Panama, and the alleged effort on the
part of a few army officers to-persuade
the garrison to revolt. ,
LOOKS TO MORAL EFFECT.
PANAMA, Dec. 8.â The gunboat Chi
cuito has left for the j Gulf - of Darien
and Chepo River, ' taking detachments
of troops. It" Is announced that the en
trance to the Atrate River at the head
of the Gulf of Darlen is being closely
guarded, bo that any attempts on the
part of the Colombian Government to
send troops through this river to - the
isthmus -will be ineffective.
COLON, Dec. S. â A company of ma
rines from the United States auxiliary
cruiser Dixie, under command of Cap
tain Wirt McCreary, landed here this
morning and took a train for Empire,
a town on the railroad near Panama,
whcie a camp was established In the
canal company's buildings. Another
company of marines, to the number of
fifty, from the Dixie, left on the after
noon train for Empire.
The camp at Empire is.now thorough
ly equipped andaJl precautions. from' a;
sanitary stanapofnt to insure the health
of the : marine^ha\V'b^h^a^ent**^Tfie
camp will be'suppfied 'with r 'w f ater from
the Dixie, ; pending .; the ; analysis of the
drinking , water ' available there. Â¦ If
this water should; be. found to be good
the remainder of /the i 450 marines, on
board the Dixie will be .transferred to
the camp in batches of flfty.
The 'stated \ official , purpose of this
movement is to give the marines prac
tice in the building of camps and to
provide relief from their long confine
ment on the vessel.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
The incident Is engaging the energetic
attention o-f the United States legation
here. Minister Irishman has made
urgent representations to the Porte and
is now awaiting a full report before
taking further steps. The outrage, It
!s anticipated here, will lead to strong
action on the part of the United States
to obtain full reparation, especially as
full satisfaction for the Beirut affair
has cct yet been given. ,
When Attarian was arrested $2500
was found in his possession. This, It
is believed, may have contributed to
his arrest, the Turks suspecting him of
being a revolutionist.
The Turkish authorities further claim
that Attarian, who is- a native of Diar
bekir, Asiatic Turkey, has been trav
eling about the country with an illegal
passport- They also point out that the
question of Armenians naturalized In
America returning to Turkey has al
ways been a source of trouble, since
the Porte invariably refuses to recog
nize naturalization.
A mob of Moslems seized on the oc
casion to make a hostile demonstration
against the consulate and against
Christians generally. The local author
ities assert that Davis struck the po
lice with a cane and that after the
rearrest of Attarian the consular ca
vasses (military couriers) attempted to
rescue him. and that in the fracas
which ensued the cavasses broke the
windows of the prison.
Davis immediately lowered the flag
over the Consulate and formally broke
off relations with the Turkish authori
ties by quitting Alexandretta, leaving
the consulate in charge of the Vice
Consul. ;..-?? ,
been hauled down and Consul Davis
has left his post for Beirut in conse
quence of a Ferious diplomatic incident,
during which Davis was insulted and
assaulted by the local police.
The affair grew out of the arrest of
an Armenian, Channes Attarian, a nat
uralized American. Attarian had been
in prison at Aleppo during the last two
months and had just been liberated
through the intervention of the Ameri
can consular agents on condition that
he leave the country forthwith.
Dcvi3 was accompanying Attarian on
board a departing steamer when the
police intercepted the party, assaulted
and Insulted Davis and, despite the re
sistance of the Consul and his atten
dant guards, rearrested Attarian and
took him back to prison.

. In this manner Hays stood up several
Japanese and relieved them of their
money. Then Bradshaw forced Hays to
go to a house in which several Mexi
cans were sleeping, it being his purpose
to rob all of them. In the darkness
Hays escaped from his captor and noti
fied the police. An hour later a patrol
man ?aw Bradshaw on the street, and
v hen he stopped him Bradshaw tried to
draw hl3 revolver, but the officer cov

and handcuffed him.
Watching his chance, Bradshaw tried
to secure the policeman's revolver, and
succeeded in drawing it from his pock

Henry Hays, the night clerk. Charles
Bradshaw. alias Smith, knocked Hays
down, relieved him of his revolver and
then compelled him to complete the Job
of robbery which he had begun.
His first victim was an old soldier
and at its inception Bradshaw's crime
was simply that of robbing a drunken
man, but before he completed his crim
inal work he caused the robbery of sev
eral persons and endeavored to add
murder to the other crimes by attempt
ing to kill a policeman.
After Hays caught him in the act of
robbing the old soldier and was dis
armed by him. Bradshaw took Hays in
tow, and, covering him with his own
weapon, marched him through the

â¢ Besides his own proper work. Spen
cer published eight parts of the "De
scriptive Sociology," arranged by him
self and compiled by Professor Duncan,
Dr. Scheppig and Mr. Collier. This
work was undertaken simply for the
purpose of providing, himself with ma

but was eventually published for the
use of others. In part VIII. published
in 1881, the announcement was made
that between 515,000 and 520,000 had

ity. Â»In 1855 he published his "Princi
ples of Psychology," which interpreted
the general principles of evolution. In
1857 in ah essay entitled Its
Law and'" Cause," which appeared in
the Westminster Review, he maii
tained for the" first time that evolution
was a universal process, which convic
tion is said to have taken such a deep
root In his mind asÂ«to be the turning
point in his career." When, in 1858/ he
planned - his "Synthetic Philosophy,"
evolution was made the keynote of the
work. (This was four "years before
Darwin's "Origin of Species" ap
pealed.) In it wasMneorporated the
psychology of 1855, and when, in 1896,
after thirty-six years of labor, the
work was finished, that was the idea
that made it, more than anything. else,
a monument to his powers as. an orig
inal and constructive thinker.
Spencer's health broke down in the
latter part of 1855 and for a ypar and
a half his pen was idle, though his
brain was not. When he recovered, he
spent "a good part of his time in writ
ing various essays for quarterly re
views. In 1860 he issued the programme
of -his "System of Synthetic Philos
ophy," which "proposed to carry out in
its application to all orders of phenom

years' of age, when he started in the
practical study of civil engineering.
After following . that profession for
so^ne eight years, during which he con
tributed .sound, valuable papers to the
Civil Engineers' and Architects' Jour
nal, a crash in railroad enterprises
turned' his efforts in another direction.
I As early as "1842 he had Written for
the Nonconformist a series of letters on
"The Proper. Sphere of Government,"
which attracted attention to his ability
and opened to him a career as_a writer.
From 1S48 to 1853 he was engaged as
suh-aditor of t.he Economist and during
that time published his first consider
able work r "Social Statics", or the Con
ditions Essential to Human Happi

the political -philosophy, of his later
writings. During the same Interval he
also contributed a number of articles

DR. SHOOP'S REMEDIES.
Dr. Shoop's
Rheumatic Cure
Costs Nothing if It Fails.
Any honest person who suffers from Rheu-
matism Is welcome to this offer. For years I
searched everywhere to find a specific for Rheu-
matism. For nearly 20 years I worked to this
end. At last. In Germany, my search was re-
warded. I found a costly chemical that did cot
disappoint me as other Rheumatic, prescriptions
had disappointed physicians everywhere.
I do not mean that Dr. Shoop's Rheumatla
Cure can turn bony joints into flesh again. That
is Impossible. But it will drive from thÂ« blood
the poison that causes pain and swelling, and
then that Is the end of Rheumatism. I know
this so well that I will furnish for a full month
my Rheumatic Cure on trial. I cannot cure all
cases within a month. It would be unreason-
able to expect that. But most cases will, yield
within 30 days. This trial treatment will con-
vince you that Dr. Shoop's Rheumatic Cure- Js
a power against Rheutr.atJsmâ a potent forca
against disease that Is irresistible.
My offer is made to convince you of my faith.
My faith iÂ» but the outcome of experience â of
actual knowledÂ»Â». ,1 know what it can do. And
I know this so well that I will furnish my rem-
edy on trial. Simply wrtte me a postal for my
book on Rheumatism. I will then arrange with
a druggist In your vicinity so that you can se-
cure six bottles of Dr. Shoop's Rheumatio Cure
to make the test. Tou make take it a full month
on trial. If It succeeds the cost to yon is & 60.
If it falls the losa is mine and mine alone. It
will be left entirely to you. I mean that Â»\--
actly. If you say the trial Is not satisfactory I
don't expect a penny from yon.
I have no samples.' Any mere sample flit
can affect chronic Rheumatism must be drugged
to the verge of danger. I use no such drugs,
for It Is dangerous to take* them. Tou must get
the disease out of the blood. My remedy does
that even in the most difficult, obstinate eases.
It has cured the eldest cases that I ever met. .
and in all of my experience. Jn all of my 2000
tests, I never found another remedy that would
cure one chronic case in ten.
Â¦Write me and I will aend you the book. Try
my remedy for a month, for it can't barm you
anyway. If It falls the loss Is mine.
Address Dr." Shoop. Box 630. Racine. Wls.
MIM cases not chronic are often cured by one
cr two bottles. At all druggists.

Noted Physician
In Galifornia
Dr. Emily Noble, noted English
physician and lecturer, is again in
California, on her way to London.
She has been to India, instructing In-
dian physicians in the use of new ac-
tinic rays. According 'to the New
, York Herald, part of her long sojourn*
in that country, was due. to the de-
mand for her professional services
among the high castes. She is now
in Los Angeles for a period, and
stopped but briefly in San Francisco,
but while here she found time to
write the following note:
J. J. Fulton Co.:

An acquaintance was made with the
Doctor and information as to the dis-
covery ar.d the nature of the treat-
ment for Bright's Disease and Dia-
betes was supplied. She stated that
there were a number of high castes in
urgent need of the new specifics and
.regretted that she did not know of
them while in India.
It is usually hard to convince phv-
sicians that Bright's Disease and Dia-
betes are curable, but the captain Dr.
Noble refers to was in command of
the steamer she came in on, and she
heard from his own lips the>full de-
tails of his remarkable recovery, and,
being broad and "progressive, she
posted herself fully during her short
stay in this city.

of the Carnegie Institute was held
here to-day. Andrew Carnegie and
Professor Agassiz of Cambridge, pres
ident of the National Academy of Sci
ences, and Judge William W. Morrow
of San Francisco, one of the trustees,
were present. Carnegie made a brief
address, in which he commended the
work already done and talked gener
ally of the aims of the Institution. The
report of the year showed sixty-six
grants made by the executive commit
tee for scientific research, involving
an aggregate of $150,000,- and recipi
ents representing every .part of the
United States and the smaller colleges,
as well as the- large universities, ob
servatories and laboratories. J
The first session was devoted to a
discussion of several large projects,
which were stated to be worthy of lib
eral support. They included:: Solar
observatory, Southern observatory, es
tablishment of a geographical labora
tory, trans-Caspian exploration and
'archaeological excavation, explora
tion in" the South Pacific Ocean,
establishment of biological ' r ex
periment laboratories and internation
al magnetic researches. As > the
amount required for all' these would
far exceed the" resources, a careful se
lection was necessary. No conclusion
was announced. .

UX1TED STATES SENATE
COXFIRMS THE NOMINATIONS
The bill does not apply the coasting
laws in their entirety to trade between
the Philippines and the United States,
as was done in the cases of Alaska,
Hawaii and Porto Rico, but simply re
stricts the transportation of freight and
passengers to American vessels.
Frye also introduced a bill to remove
discrimination against American sail
ing vessels in the coasting trade by pro
viding for the licensing of pilots for
terms of five years when applicant has
been found competent and trustworthy.
Representative Gillette of Massachu
setts introduced a bill to-day to "pro
tect anti-gambling laws from nullifi
cation by interstate gambling by tele
graph."
Representative Hepburn to-day rem
troduced the pure food bill, embodying
the resolutions of the National Pure
Food Congress. No Important changes
Â¦were made in the bill.
SCOPE OF THE MEASURE.
(senator Frye to-day introduced a bill
to regulate commerce between the
United States and th Philippine archi
pelagc, providing that on and after
July 1, 1904, under the penalty of for
feiture, no merchandise shall v be trans
ported by sea or any passengers car
ried between ports of the United States
and ports and places in the Philippine
archipelago in any other than vessels
sailing under the flag of the United
States.
Senator Nelson also introduced a bill
to authorize national banking associa
tions to make loans on real estate se
curity. The bill provides that any na
tional banking association In a place
of not more than 20,000 population may
loan monev not. exceeding in the ag
gregate one-third of its paid up capital
and surplus upon real estate security,
such loans not to exceed in any case
one-third of the real cash value of the
security.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 8.â Senator
Nelson to-day Introduced a bill almost
identical with the Aldrich financial bill
introduced in the Fifty-seventh Con
gress, in so far as It provides for the
increasing of circulating notes of na
tional bank associations. It provides
that the Treasurer of the United States
may receive as deposits, In addition to
the United States bonds required to be
deposited under existing laws, bonds or
interest bearing obligations of any
State, county or city or railroad com
pany under the same conditions exact
ed in the Aldrich bill. (
Provision is made that the banking
associations shall be entitled to receive
circulating notes in amount equal to
the par value of such bonds or interest
bearing obligations, provided that the
total amount of circulating notes issued
shall not exceed at any time the
amount of capital stock actually paid
in. This provision does not, however,
repeal or modify the requirement that
additional deposits of bonds or lawful
money shall be made In case the mar
ket value of the bonds* or obligations
shall fall below their par value.
LOANS OX REAL ESTATE.
Teller said it was not true that the
bill would reduce the price of sugar. He
declared that the sugar trust would se
cure the benefits of the bill, although It
is said it was Intended to aid Cuba.
The powers behind :the 'bill were the
owners of 80.000,000 acres of sugar lands
in Cuba, owned by American citizens,
besfdes the hundreds of millions of dol
lars of the sugar trust.
â¢Teller said General Wood two years
ago had sent circulars to Senators urg
ing the passage of the th,en . pending
Cuban bill, an act that would have re
sulted"in the cashiering â¢ of any other
officer. General Wood had sent out cir
culars, he said, early in September,
1391, to alcaldes and other municipal
officers in Cuba,, urging them to pre
pare demands on the United States for
a reduction of the duty on sugar and
tobacco.
. GORMAX ENTERS OBJECTION*.
Gorman objected to the reference of
the Penrose resolution to the Committee
on Postoffices, saying that he could not
see why Lodge or any one else "should
desire to stifle the investigation." The
President had called attention to the
Irregularities In the department, saying
that the frauds perpetrated in the past
ten. years had been greater than in the
past two centuries. This declaration
he characterized as "sweeping and hor
rible," and he declared that no Senator
could afford to stand in the way of an
Investigation in which the minority
party could participate. The money
taken, he said, had been fillched from
the pockets of the common peopled The
corruption had been so great that it
had bubbled ui> to the surface, and this
had occurred "because the thieves had
quarreled among themselves over the
plunder." Vv r
"I assert here as a Senator," he
went on, "that there is evidence in
writing that there were frauds perpe
trated by a high official, who was al
lowed to escape entirely. We want
facts.. The country Is not satisfied
with the thoroughness of the inquiry
and wants the books laid open for in
spection in order that the entire truth
may be known. We want to aid the
President in turning the rascals out,
as we have no doubt that he desires to
do, and for these reasons we hope that
the inquiry will be undertaken."
LODGE REPLIES TO GORMANV-
Lodge said thatl if hie had" needed
any further assurance of the correct
ness of his position that the resolution
should be referred, the speech made
by Gorman had supplied it. He
charged Gorman with incorrectly
quoting the President and said that
the portion of the President's, message
to which reference had been 'made ap
plied to the frauds in St. Louis and not
to the postal frauds.
"The Setiator from Maryland for
gets," he said, "that Congress has
twice investigated that portion of the
postal service found to be most at
fault. Both the Senate and House
have made Inquiries, under the eyes of
friends of the Senator, and both gave
the department a clean bill of .Jiealth.
As a matter of fact, there is nothing
i more clumsy than a Congressional in
quiry, and the results of the depart
ment's inquiry, made under the direc
tion'of the President, illustrate the
gjeat advantage the department, with
Its numerous detectives, enjoys over
any Congressional committee in this
respect."
TELLER ATTACKS CUBAN BILL.
When the investigation resolution
was laid aside and the Cuban reciproc
ity bill taken up, Teller-opened the de.
bate In behalf of the opposition, first
taking up the question of constitution
ality of the methods of legislation un
dertaken by the measure. He spoke of
the possibility of executive encroach
ment, saying that if the Senate was to
be shorn of. its power It. would not be
by the House of Representatives or by
any legal instrument,- but In obedience
to the demands of the executive for a
cowardly abdication.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 8.â The recent
investigation into frauds in the Post
office Department was the basis of a
sharp tilt in the Senate to-day by Gor
man and Lodge. The discussion arose
over a motion by Lodge to refer to the
Committee on Postoffices the resolution
Introduced by Penrose looking ~to a
Senate Investigation into the conditions
in the department. Gorman Intimated
that the investigation by the depart
ment^had been partisan In character
and said that counter charges had been
made against the men who had made
it. Lodge defended \ the department's
work and declared it was far more
thorough than a Congressional Investi
gation would be. The resolution went
over Without action.
Teller made a speech in opposition to
the Cuban bill. He severely criticized
General Wood and declared the bill
was' in the Interest of the -sugar trust.
Clapp spoke briefly, holding that the
Senate had absolute power in making
treaties.
"One well-recognized weakness, how
ever, has been strongly emphasizedâ
our currency system Is nbnelastlc. It
does not respond to the varying needs
of seasons, or of localities, or of
changing conditions of business. This
admitted defect should be remedied.
But in remedying it no measure should
be considered that will In . anywise
weaken that which is now stable, and
no element should be injected that will
cause distrust or doubt.. Fortunately,
at the present time no recipient of any
of our several forms of money stops to
examine its character. It Is all known
to hf- as good as gold, for the credit of
the Government is pledged to maintain
its parity with gold. No act should be
passed authorizing the issuance of
anything less safe and secure."
Speaking of the subsidiary coinage,
Secretary Shaw says:
"There is* now available for coinage
Into subsidiary coin less than 5,000,000
ounces of silver. This will be exhausted
approximately at the close of the cur
rent fiscal year. Authority should be
given to recoln existing silver dollars
into subsidiary coin, or to purchase ad
ditional silver with which to supply
the ever-Increasing needs of the coun
try. The Dresent volume of silver
stored in the vaults of the Treasury is
equivalent to nearly 500 carloads of
thirty tons each. It would cost $100,000
to recount it. This enormous .amount
Is worth In bullion less than half of its
coinage value, but it is 'all redeemable,
at the discretion of the Secretary of
the Treasury, In gold." Manifestly it
must always be stored or other uses
provided. Whether it be wiser to con
tinue this burden and purchase addi
tional bullion for subsidiary coinage,
or to authorize the conversion of a por
tion of these dollars Into more avail
able forms of money, is for Congress
to determine. In any event, some pro
vision should be made for an Increase
of subsidiary coin."
"Our currency system," says the Sec
retary of the Treasury, "has been sub
jected durinz the year to some very
severe tests. Unprecedented prosperity
encouraged the natural optimism of our
people to such an extent that property
of all kinds found ready and eager buy
ers at figures phenomenally high. A
condition therefore existed which of
necessity could not last. Within a
year the market value of stocks* and
bonds, the proper and legitimate hold
ings of the people, has depreciated in
an amount estimated far. in excess of
the cost of four years' devastating civil
war. Yet notwithstanding this enor
mous and inconceivable Shrinkage, It
has not affected in noticeable, degree
other classes of property. Banking in
stitutions have exhibited no -suggestion
of- weakness, few business failures have
occurred, there has been but a flight
curtailment in commercial enterprises,
very little apparent hardship and abso
lutely no fear of any depreciation in
any form of currency. To all appear
ances the crisis is passed. There now
exists scant reason for apprehension â
certainly no occasion for alarm.
"By the provision of a very wise act
of Congress approved March 14, 1900,
it was made the # duty ef the Secretary
of the Treasury to redeem United
States notes and treasury notes in gold
on demand, and to maintain all forms
of money issued or coined by the Gov
ernment at a parity of value. Evident
ly the people have understood, as they
are justified in doing, that this statute
authorizes the redemption of silver and
silver certificates in gold whenever nec
essary for the maintenance of parity.
Nothing short of this assurance would
have carried us through the period to
which I have referred. [
CALL, BUREAU. 1406 G STREET, N.
W.. WASHINGTON. Dec. 8.â In his
annual report Secretary of the Treas
ury Shaw speaks optimistically of the
financial condition or the country,
which, he says, has passed the crisis
which in the last year caused a shrink
age cf the market value of stocks and
bonds.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 8.â To nullify
attempts of cattle companies and oth
ers to obtain public lands in violation
of the law, the Secretary of the Inte
rior to-day overruled former decisions
of the department that widows or mi
nor orphans of soldiers or sailors do
not have to reside on the land on which
they make homestead entry. The de
cision, which affects a large number of
cases, and which has an Important
bearing on the public land frauds, is
made in the case of Mrs. Anne Bowes,
who made an entry on land in the Bro
ken Bow district In Nebraska. Mrs.
Bowes claimed the right of entry as
the widow of a sailor In the Civil War.
under a section of the Revised Statutes
which allows such dependents to make
homestead entries with credit for the
time of the soldier's or sailor's military
or naval service. It was admitted this
case was made under an agreement
with the Standard Cattle Company,
whereby Mrs.- Bowes, at the time of the
entry, leased the land to the company,
with the further agreement that the
company should have the option of pur
chasing the land. -The department de
cides that Mrs. Bowes Is required to
maintain residence on the land and that
her agreement with the company In
validated the entry and requires its
cancellation.
*** Mrs. Georgi. daughter of his boyhood
friends, took their place in looking
after his old age as they had done for
him In youth, and on his deathbed, un
able to make a will, he called witnesses
and verbally left her his estate.
NEW YORK. Dec. 8.â Gilt-edged se
curities with a market value of J7S3,-
C00 have been taken from a safety de
posit box by attorneys for the heirs of
Maximilian Hershel. an aged recluse
and former member of the New York
Stock Exchange, who died in St. Luke a
Hospital last July. Ninety-three addi
tional bonds bring the value of the
hoard up to $330,000.
Just before 'he died Hershel an
nounced in the presence of witnesses
that he wished all his property to be
turned over to Mrs. William Georgi of
Brooklyn, daughter of a couple who
had befriended him In his youth aud
who had made his declining years com
fortable by numerous attentions, not
knowing of his great wealth.
Mrs. Georgi attended him In his dying
moments, little dreaming that she was
heiress to Jl.OOO.OOO. Four relatives of
the old man were living in Germany, it
was found, and Mrs. Georgi declared
that the property should be equally di
vided, so far as she was concerned. At
torneys for both interests arranged this
and the escate will be divided at the
end of six months into five equal parts.
The heirs living in Germany were un
known to Hershel. They wera found
through advertising, but have proved
their relationship and Mrs. Georgi
evinced no desire to keep them from
sharing her good fortune.
Some delay was experienced In secur
ing permission to open the safety de
posit boxes held in Hershel's name.
Hershel emigrated from Germany
forty years ago. On the steamer he

â¢ General Wilson told the com
mittee of the meeting with Cap
tain E. G. Bellairs in Havana, say
ing that he became convinced that Bel
lairs came to Havana for the nurpose
of \villfully falsifying conditions on the
island; that Bellairs called on him at
his headquarters in the province of Ma
tanzas. and that he (General .Wilson)
then accused BeUairs of writing dis
patches vhlch gave a wrong color to
affairs on the Island and Injured the
work cf General Brooke and others.
The witness said that Bellairs ad
mitted that he was standing by his
friends, declaring that his position was
a necessary one. General Wilson said
the remark could have but one mean
ing, and that was that he was backing
General Wcod, and that-this was evi
dent from the nature of Bellairs' dis

CALL. BUREAU, 1406 G STREET,
N.-.W., WASHINGTON. Dec. 8.âGen
eral James H. Wilson, U. S. A., "retired;
was the most important witness before
the Senate Committee on .Military Af
fairs to-day. He greatly encouraged
General Wood's enemies and is said to
have shown considerable bitterness in
giving his testimony, and in response
to. questions plainly indicated that he"
regarded General Wood's promotion as
one of preferment and not warranted
by meritorious service.
A large part of â¢ his testimony was
devoted to the newspaper correspond
ent, Bellairs, . who, he said, did great
injustice to nearly all American officers
in Cuba except General Wood., It was
his opinion that Bellairs went to Ha
vana solely for the purpose of advanc
ing the latter. ;
Other witnesses were C. Fosnes,
.a postoffice inspector, and Major Ed
gar S. Â¦ Dudley. U. S. A., who had to
pass on the character of the Jai All
Company, whose concession was grant
ed by General Wood.
Senators Hanna and Teller,' as well
as Major Rathbone, have. been request
ed to have all their testimony before
the committee on or before, December
16, and opponents of confirmation take
exception to this, on the ground that
It may curtail the inquiry.
Major Edgar S. Dudley, who
served in Cuba as judge ad
vocate under General Wood, said that
when General Wood received the ap
plication of the Jai Alal Company for
a concession to erect a "fronton" for
the playing of the Cuban game of pe
lota the application had been referred
to him for investigation. . After mak
ing a i thorough inquiry into the char
acter of the same, the witness said,
he had informed General Wpod that
he should refuse to indorse the appli
cation, on the ground that the game
was a gambling institution. He said
! that the application had been changed
to represent the mere building of an
amusement amphitheater and that in
that form It had received the approval
of the War Department. The conces
sion to the Jai Alai Company was sub
i sequently granted by General Wood.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
The brief of Bunn is an argument to
show that the action of the two rail
road companies did not come within
the anti-trust act. He says:
'â¢The statute must be interpreted so
as to fall with -the executive power3 of
Congress. Construed as the Circuit
Court read it or as the learned Attor
ney General asks to have it read, the
act seems to us far beyond the scope
of those powers. It is nothing less thai;
an overturning of all settled rules upon
the subject to say that the power of
Congress extends to determining in
â¢what corporations stock may be held
t>y citizens of the States, or that it ex
tends to th** regulations of the consoli
dation and merger of railway compa
nies chartered by the States."
He assert? that "the only combina
tion of which there is any evidence is
a combination formed in aid of com
merce, to liberate, protect and enlarge,
and not to restrain it. and which has
liberated, protected, enlarged and aided
it and has net restrained and does not
threaten to restrain."
The first idea was to form a trust
company, but Young ecys It was quick-
Jy abandoned. It was thought to incor
porate under the laws of Minnesota,
but it was found impracticable to se
cure an acceptable charter in that
State, consequently the papers were
filed in New Jersey.
On the question of consolidation in
the Securities Company. Young says:
â¢'Its ownership of the shares of the
two railway companies no more con
solidates or pools or merges those
shares or the two companies or their
property than the ownership of two
pieces of real estate by the same per
son consolidates them or the title to
ihem."
Young's brief is a document of morÂ»
ihan 300 pages, and in it he traces
minutely the origin of the merger. The
movement for this consolidation he at
tributes largely to' the raid of May,
1901, by hostile interests on Northern
Pacific stock, which it was considered
most important to prevent, and saying:
"The Union Pacific interests still heid
537,000,000 of the Northern Pacific com
mon stock. Between 51,000.000 and $2,
000,000 were not held by either of the
parties. The loss of 53,000,000 frcm the
majority holdings might occur from
various causes and the attack just de
feated mig.nt be renewed with success
by the same or other assailants."
He says that in this emergency
Messrs. Morgan and Hill saw clearly
that they must depend upon themselves
and not upon the law for protection.
They had every reason to believe.
Young continues, that such a holding
as that of the Union Pacific in the
Northern Pacific was not contrary to
the anti-trust law and the "inaction oC
the Attorney General showed that this
Â¦was also the opinion of that high offi
cial charge 1 with the enforcement of
the anti-trust act."

ert Greene's "Friar Bacon and Friar
Bungay" and Samuel Johnson's "Silent
"Women." It Is likely that Greene's
play, will be chosen, though there is
an objection to it on account of tha
necessity for elaborate scenery. John
son's play does not call for so much
elaboration, but it is not as interesting
as Greene's. The play, whichever It
lsÂ«, will be presented at the Greek
Theater on Charter day.
The French Club will present one of
Moliere's comedies some time during

hanging in his home in Doolan Can

According to the Frankfurter Zei

expected they will .later enter into the
proposed international arrangements, j
The Standard Oil Company thereafter
refused to renew the agreement, and

talented mezzo-soprano, returned home
last evening, arriving by the Santa Fe
route. She reached New York the day
before Thanksgiving and was while in
the metropolis the guest of Mr. and

sively entertained there and was hon
ored with a dinner tendered her by
friends who are members of the Fritzi
Scheff Opera Company. From the great
Atlantic seaport, Miss Daniells traveled
to Chicago, where she spent a few days
with, a former instructor.
"I have na^definlte plans for the fu

at her home -.to-night. i."I have been
away so long that I ami glad to be at
home again for a while. I do not ex

will. go next"! have not decided upon.
Miss Belle McCurrie of Alameda, who
accompanied me to Europe aiid who
was with me while I was studying at
Cassell, is now in Berlin and her home
coming Is indefinite. She is taking a
full vocal and dramatic course. While
in Europe' we visited Berlin, Marburg,
Leipsic, Dresden and Weimar. Miss Me-
Currfe is at present at the Stearns Uni

Miss Daniells' voice first attracted the
attention of the critics about four years
ago. By request she sang \f or Henry
Barnabee of the Bostonians and Mau

were well impressed with the beautiful
Alameda girl's voice and predicted for
her a brilliant future if she embarked

rapidly from Market-street station and
the woman threw herself on the tracks
in front of the approaching train. Mrs.
Redmond followed, but could not drag
her charge from the track until after
the trahi had been stopped.
The nurse nspisted Mrs. Kleigel to
the sidewalk and subsequently she was

Mrs. W. J. McKec-n, mother oT Mrs.

ferer from nervous prostration caused
by serious illness and was under care

a candy-maker, working in Sacramento.
By deliberately throwing herself in
front of a Seventh-street local train
this morning at Castro and Seventh
streets, Mrs. B. J. Kleigel, residing at
1255 West street, made a desperate at
tempt -to .commit suicide. . That the
woman was not mangled to death was
due to the prompt and skillful wcTrk
of George -B. Jeffries, engineer of the
locomotive,' who saw the form on the
track in time to bring the train to. a
stop. The engine pilot just reached the
prostrate woman when the momentum
was checked.

Neither George W. Reed, the new at
torney for the Public Administrator,
nor Mr. Gray, himself will make any
statement, which leaves Mr. Langan's
to be interpreted in the' light of past
and present events. Mr. Langan's ref
erence to Mr. Gray's "employers" can
only be, made to apply to H. W. Meek
of San Lorenzo, upon whose magnifi
cent ranch Mr. Gray is the foreman.
But, like all the others, Mr. Meek has
nothing to say except to disclaim any
authority over Mr. Gray as Public Ad
ministrator.
The people of Hayward?. where Mr.
Gray ami Mr. Langan reside, are much
interested ia this matter. When, Just
after the election of Mr. Gray, it was
proposed to give the work to Reed, &
Nusbaumer, the people of Haywards
held a mass-meeting, at which they
called both Gray and Langan before
them, while the citizens of the town
sat as a jury of several hundred upon
the case. Each side made its statement
to the citizens, with the result that
the work of the office was divided. Now
Mr. Reed is given all of the work.
The removal of G. W. Langan as at
torney for Public Administrator George
Gray has brought forth a quantity of
caustic comment from the lawyer, but
silence is maintained by . Gray and
George W. Reed, who now gets, all of
the business at that office. This is the
way Langan talks about the matter:
"I do not-blame Gray, for the deal
was carried out by his employers. But
I was the man who got Gray to run
for the office <?f Public Administrator.
I was the man who got him the dele
gation from his own township. I put
money into his fight, and as he was
elected by a narrow margin I can say
that I'was the man who elected him.
I had the promise of Mr. Gray that I
should be attorney for his office. Mr.
Gray was elected, and then the fight
began to get the patronage of the of
fice. I flnairy consented to share the
work with another firm, and now it
would seem that they have all of the
work." j "^ ;-

the Friday evening, in question he met

Moffltt started through the second

Oakland! She explained to him that
she was the wife of an employe of the
Southern Pacific Company and that she
was traveling upon ' "transportation,"
but that the said transportation was
lost, had strayed or, had been stolen.
This was not exactly the phraseology
used by Mrs. Alexander, but Moffitt
says that this was what she meant.

her remarks. These consisted of sev

Special Dispatch to The Call
"So It is with your church â in spite of
adversity it has proven itself master of
the situation."-. 'Â¦Â¦'.. -i.
A pleasing incident of the service wa3
the meeting of Dr. Haynes and Mrs.
Stacey, a former soloist in the choir
of the Belden-avenue Church in Chi
cago. Dr. Haynes did not know thit
Mrs. Stacey was to be present until by
request of the pastor of the church she
rose to sing the solo of the evening.
The Rev. 11. W. Haynes. pastor of
the Belden-avenue Baptist Church of
Chicago, preached the sermon at the
special service held to-night to cele
brate the forty-ninth anniversary of
the organization of the First Baptist
Church of this city.
The services were held at Masonic
Hall, which has been used as a place of
meeting by the congregation of the
church since the destruction of the
church building at Fourteenth and
Brush streets by fire on August 10, 1902.
The First Baptist Church was or
ganized December 7, 1834, and was rec
ognized by the ecclesiastical council
December 17, 1S34. Its first house of
worship waa located at Fifth and Jef
ferson streets and was the first Pro
testant church to be erected in Oak
land. In February. 1864. the building
was removed to Ninth street, between
Clay and Jefferson streets.
In 1S68 the lot on, the corner of Four
teenth and Brush' streets was secured
and a new church erected, which was
occupied by the congregation until it*
destruction by fire. When the new
church at the corner of Jones street
and Telejrraph avenue Is completed tha
congregation of the First Baptist
Church will possess one of the most
beautiful houses of worship on the Pa
cific Coast. The new edifice will be
completed during the fiftieth year of
the life of the church organization.
The present pa3tor of the church.
Rev. H. J. Vosburgh. began his pas
torate September 1, 1901, being preceded
by the Rev. C. H. Hobart, who served
the church for fourteen years.
The services this evening were opened
with a short scripture reading and a
brief address by the pastor. Dr.
Haynes was then introduced. He took
as his text, "I have learned In what
soever State I am to be content," but
he added:
"I think that a far better as well as
more modern translation would bs: "I
have learned in whatsoever State I am
to be master of the situation.' Take, for
instance, the case of two farmers who

the Orescent yards had ever been any
thing but a burden to the shipbuilding
company since its acquisition. He ad
mitted that the shipbuilding company
had put into the Crescent plant several
hundred dollars more, than it had ob
tained from it. The tone of Untermy

had been coached by the defense's
counsel on both sides, and the witness
entered upon a warm interchange of
remarks, at the close of which Nixon
was excused.

the formation of the company and that

cent yards was really his promoter's

Edward Jones, .who stormed the resi
dence of Gus Thomberg. 678 Ninth ave
nue, while laboring under the halluci
nation that his family was inside and
being burned to death, was committed
to the Ukiah Asylum yesterday by
Judge Mosan. While in court the de
mented man repeatedly implored the
Judge to make the audience stop talk

himself in a way that left no. room for
doubt as to his mental. infirmity .V
LAWYER STIRS
NIXON'S ANGER
Of such forgiving. spirit was William
Shaughnessy that he resolutely declined
to prosecute Jalma Johnson, by whom
he had been* stabbed several times in
the arm. The men were, engaged 'in
a fizht at North Beach when the cut
ting was done.
A pocket knife with open blade was
the material evidence that Policeman
J. L. Nelson produced to substantiate
the charge of carrying concealed weap
ons which he had filed against John
McCarly. .
In his own defense McCarty told
Judge Mogan that wnile attending a
Jockeys' ball pn the Barbary Coast last
Monday nisrht he aroused the jealousy
.and violent antagonism of "a tough
looking tout," and that fearing attack
he had opened his pocket knife with
out drawing it from concealment in'or
der to .protect 1 himself, if the odds of
combat should be against him. But as
he was not s courting conflict he left the
scene of 'revelry and was proceeding
quietly to his home when the police
man overhauled him.
The explanation was good enough to
obtain dismissal of the case.
"Don't get drunk."
Mr. Cunningham's effort to appear
grateful for the admonition was earn
est, but not entirely successful.'
"Don't permit yourself to believe that
an exceptional equipment of physical
strength clothes its possessor with a
right to wreck saloons and assault per
sons who may attempt to stay the de
molition.
But there was nothing Chesterrleldian
in the tone with which his Honor Mo
gan laid down the law to Edward Cun
ningham, a brawny marine engineer
who had wrecked a water front grog
shop and then privately made a mone
tary settlement with the man whose
property he had destroyed.
"You are a fair type of that class of
sea -going chaps that imagine them
selves monarchs of all they survey
when they hav& come ashore and hoist
ed in a cargo of strong waters," said
the Judge to the defendant. "While la
boring under this delusion you and your
ilk ignore property rights and believe
that so long as you are able and willing
to pay you have a perfect rigKt to
smash either persons or things. Now,
Mr. Cunningham, it is a matter of fact
and law that I could send you to jail
for disturbing the peace, despite your
settlement out of court -with the com
plaining witness, and I certainly would
do so if your attorney had not pleaded
that you are penitent and ready to re
turn to sea if I release you. Well, I
will let you go and would suggest that
when you go to sea you remember and
digest these words of counsel:
"Don't get drunk.
"Don't imagine that a seaman ashore
has any more prerogatives or privi
leges than a landlubber.
"Don't get drunk.
"In dismissing you I only wish tq say
that if you are a thief ;-ou -will soon
be here again. 1 I don't say you are dis
honest, but if you are not innocent of
this crime you will again soon appear
in court as a defendant."
â¢William Dahlerwas the next recip
ient of Judge Mogan's attention. He
was accused of stealing 555 from the
coat of a- fellow workman in a Geary
street, bakeshop, and 'while the attend
ant circumstances and his subsequent
conduct indicated guilt the â¢ evidence
was insufllcient to justify the court In
holding him. But the paucity of posi
tive proof- did not prevent the court
speaking its mind to the defendant.
"While you are probably guilty."
said the Judge, "the law does not per
mit me to hold you. Nobody saw you
take the money, and the fact that sev
eral other men had the same oppor
tunity as you had to pilfer it also helps
you to freedom. But the fact that
when the money was missed you were
also missed, and that you did not re
turn to the bakery, even to get the
wages due you, does not strengthen any
supposition of your innocence that may
exist.

The case of A'.fce Hall wasjVtale of
two courts. Alice, who is j youthful,
pretty and undoubtedly wicked, . was
recently sentenced to thirty^ days for
vagrancy by Judge .Mogah.tbut ' she
supplied an appeal bond : and* w-as lib
erated. While -the appeal ..was still
pending she was haled-? before* Judge
Fritz on a similar .charge, was simi
larly convicted and obtained her liberty
by similar means.. With both appeals
pending she was arrested again last
Monday for vagrancy, and yesterday
Judge Mogan gave her six, months on
the latest charge, and, then. suggested
that she- be taken over^to; Judge. Fritz
to see what he \vante i a*;t'o'<<ioi with her
case in his court. Judge Fritz did not
have time to attend to the matter, yes
terday. * ,
"Alice, you seem to be a continuous
performer in these courts," said Judge
Mogan to the defendant, "and I really
think- you are entitled to a rest. I will
contribute six months to your needed
period of relaxation, and maybe neigh
bor Fritz may extend it." â¢ Â¦
Miss Hall smiled at the judicial
sally as she was escorted to the cor
ridor. / â¢ . '-l-f-'i
"Which we must accept as your ex
cuse for putting this court to a great
deal of trouble. Ah, well, I suppose one
of the things we are here for, Mrs.
Mitchell, -is to serve as a sort of arbi
tration board for the settlement of do
mestic difficulties, and, incidentally,
to act as a medium of scaring refrac
tory husbands. But now, Mrs. Mitchell,
your logical perception must show you
the attitude of incertitude in which
your change of mind has placed me.
If you are quite certain â or, I would
better say, as certain as a woman can
be â that you will not again change
your mind and desire to have Mr.
Mitchell again incarcerated, I might
dismiss this charge against him."
"Oh. I'm quite sure. Judge, indeed I
am." said the lady with much earnest
ness.
"Then he may go. And, much as I
bave enjoyed your visit here, Mrs.
Mitchell, I would not perish of ennui
if you should neglect to come again."
Mrs. Mitchell grabbed the arm of the
man she had forgiven and hastily
towed him out of court.
"It's the recognized privilege of wo
man -to change her mind as frequently
as she pleases," said Judge Mogan to
Mrs. Mathilda Mitchell of 1902 Nine
teenth avenue, "and that is what per
plexes me in this case of yours. In the
first place, when you had your husband
arrested and charged with having
chased you two blocks and fired nu
merous shots at you, the vigor witn
which you filed your complaint led this
court to believe that you really intend
ed to prosecute to the bitter end. But
now you come and sweetly inform me
that you bave ' changed your mind
that not for untold gold would you
have your p potise deprived of his free
dom. Thus is obtrusively presented to
me the vexing question: Is your mind
made up for keeps this time, or is it
likely to undergo another radical mu
tation and prompt you to prosecute?"
â¢ "Indeed it won't. Judge," said Mrs.
Mitchell, anxiously. "I"m sorry I had
my husband arrested arid would not
have done so if I hadn't been excited."

Yesterday was an exceptionally quiet
day in the four departments of the Po
lice Court. The cases were unusually
few and of unexciting caliber, and
the attendance in the auditoriums was
correspondingly small. But the slim
ness of the dockets was an indirect
public blessing, nevertheless, for it en
abled the Judges to devote more than
wonted time to each hearing and to
dispense more than ordinary doses of
that profound philosophy for which
they are becoming famous.

Question of Providing:. Funds
for the Trip the One Ob
stacle in Way of Acceptance
PLEASED ' WITH THE IDEA
'â¢The idea is very new to me, but it
sounds good." said Representative
Pffyne of New York, Republican floor
leader in the House. "I do not know
just how the reunion could be accom
plished. We could no doubt both learn
a great deal and get pome good, new
ideas in a parliamentary way as well
as on the subject of international arbi
tration, and good could hardly fail to
result from the social intercourse."
"It is a nice idea," he said, "but at
present I do not see where we could
get time to go, even if we could get the
money. However, it is something to
thinkabout and the future might bring
an opportunity of realization. While we
are considering it, I should say that it
*vould be as good, if not a better, idea
to visit the English Parliament, where
the customs are not so different, es
pecially in the House of Parliament."
Speaker Cannon, ruler of the House
of Representatives, shook his head
Fomrwhat dubiously when he mused
on thÂ« length of the trip and the time
It would take.
"The idea is a very pleasant one, if
it is practical.*! raid Senator Allison.
As the senior member of the upper
body does not often give his opinions
on such matters this expression from
him means a great deal. Allison said
that he thought such a visit might
bring about many pleasant connections
among individuals in a fraternal and
social way, although he was not sure
that it could cause much better feel
ing between the two nations, since their
relations were already on a most pleas
ant and friendly basis.
"I think that a reunion between the
members of the American and French
legislative bodies wc-uld be a good
thing." said Senator Cullom, chairman
of the Senate Committee on Foreign
Relations. "'I say this without any se
rious thought as to Mow it could be
brought about. Some practical plan, of
course, wc-u!d have to be formed and
the matter of expense might prove a
Ftvmbling block."
The idea is regarded as a novel one,
.but this by no means seemed to mili
tate against it. The suggestion was,
on the cc-ntrary, received to-day with
rr.any expressions of favor. Many Con
gressmen who. for obvious reasons, did
not wish to be quoted were heartily
in favor of such a trip, but expressed
the fear tliat if Congress should vote
an sppropriatic-n for the purpose indi
vidual Congressmen wouid be held to
account by their constituents.

A REED SIJAKEX
WITH THE WIND
Without Will Power, Courage, Ambi-
tion, Energy or Hope the Dys-
peptic Is Willing to Give Up
the Struggle.
The confirmed dyspeptic has as lit-
tle interest in life as any human be-
ing. He is unfitted for its duties and
is indifferent to its charms. He is un-
able to enjoy the business and social
relations that constitute the life of the
average man. All 'his hopes are ab-
sorbed by the one hope to get well
and again be able to enjoy the good
things of life. Until this is realized
he is sick at heart" and feels himself
to be of little use.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are the
sufferer's tree of life. They will cure
him and bring him health and happi-
ness just as sure and certain as he
takes- them. They are sure because
they are natural and . no other cure
but a natural one is sure. They act
on the food and digest it just as well
as a stomach would. .They contain
exactly the same chemical properties
as the digestive fluids of the stomach.
By putting Stuart's Dyspepsia Tab-
lets in a bottle or jar with any kind
of food, meat, eggs or vegetables, with
sufficient amount of water, the proc-
ess of digestion is carried out just as
it is in a healthy human stomach and
in the same time. There is conse-
quently no unnatural disturbance of
the digestive organs resulting from
the use of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.
They relieve the weak and worn out
stomach of its work and permit it to
rest up and recuperate and regain its
normal health and strength.
A well known Buffalo physician
says: "I prescribe Stuart's Dyspep-
sia Tablets on al4 occasions as a re-
Jief for weakened and run down stom-
ach?. I find they contain all the in-
gredients necessary far the proper di-
gestion of the food and will do more
to give the stomach-the needed rest
than any medicine *I could prescribe.
They have never failed to give imme-
diate relief in all my cases and.I.do
not hesitate to recommend them to all
sufferers from dyspepsia.".
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are for
sale by all druggists at 50 cents a box.

CELEBRATES GREAT EVENT.
J. A. Filcher, pommisslbner of Cali
fornia to the World's Fair,, '.was the
next speaker. His speech in part was
as follows:
â¢In all times, so, far as we. are atfvlscd.^man
klnd has .been accustomed,- In one form or
another, to celebrate great events. Pursuant
to this custom it Is very : natural that .'the
United Statea should cejebrate the acquisi
tion of one of its most .Important pieces of
territory. â¢ Â¦ '/ ?Â¦( Â¦
In 1803 the so-called Louisiana Territory,
lying on the Amerlcsn continent and extend
ing from the Gulf of .Mexico -.to the -.British
posrcsslona on the nbrth '.and from the Mis
sissippi Ulver to' the summit of the ' Rocky
Mountains on the west, was purchased' from
France by the United States Government, the
negotiations on the part of President Jeffer
son being conducted by his Minister to France,'
Robert R. Livlnsston. and on j the part of
Napoleon nonararte then First' Consul of,
the republic of France by his Minister, Fran
cols Barbe-Marbols
The sum paid for this Territory 1 was $15,000,
000 United States money. ~* The Importance
of this acquisition though great at- the time,
was not realized. ' It gave the United -State*
control of the Mississippi River system and
extended ltn title over a territory greater
than" the original area of the country. Out
of this vast domain fourteen States and Ter
ritories have since been carvedâ Louisiana,
Arkansas Missouri Iowa. Minnesota. Okla
homa, Indinn Territory. Kansas. Nebraska,
South Dakota. North Dakota. Colorado. Wy
oming, and Montana. At the suggestion of
the French Minister the boundaries on the
west were left undefined, and Immediately
after the purchase thp Lewis and Clark ex
pedition started- from St. Louis, and explored
the Northwest â¢ to the Pacific, eo as to sup
port the title by right of discovery and oc
cupation. - -Â¦ Â¦ - ; Â¦ Â¦ i' 1 "''
Thus the Louisiana purchase made possible
a. country under one government reaching
from the Atlantic to the Pacific and estab
lished the prestige of the United States on
thp North American continent.
It wr* in the Congresses of the trans-MiEsis
slppl States that the question of .celebrating
this purchase was first suggested. After re
peated agitation a convention finally assembled
In St. I^outs on the 10th of January, 1890, com
prised of ninety-three delegates, appointed by
the Governors of the respective States and Ter
ritories of. the purchaser This convention ap
pointed an executive Committee, with the. Hon.
David R. Francis. ex-Governor of Missouri, as
chairman. They : ' decUed -on celebrating the
event by a great world's exposition and settled
on St. Louis, the most Important city within
the limits of the purchase, as the place for
holding the sarne.' They prepared -.a plan for
raising the money to build the buildings and
defray the general expenses of the undertaking.
They fixed the amount at $15,000,000. the same
as had been imid to France for,. the Louisiana
Territory. "One-third of this. was to be raised
by private subscription, ona-^hlrd by the city
of St. Louis, and one- third was' to bo asked
from the General Government. Early . In the
year 1901 the private subscription was com
pleted. t Soon afterwords St. Louis, authorized
the issuance cf $3,000,000 of municipal, bonds.
In March of the same year the Senate finally
passed the House bill appropriating ?5.000,000
by the General Government. This action es
tablished the success of the stupendous under
taking. A proclamation was Issued -by. Presl
"dent McKlnley Inviting' the nations of the
world to participate. ..This was disseminated
through â¢ our . country'* representatives at for
eign courts, and up to this time It Is gratify
ing to state. that about fifty foreign countries
have signified their intention to take part In
this world's congress." . .* . ,'vÂ»V- - .
EXPOSITION'S EXTENT.
The ground selected ""comprised the west half
of Forest Park and Includes between 1200 and
1300 acres. Fifteen large: buildings have been
erected by i the â¢ exposition authorities for the
Installation of the exhibits, which. In their en
tirety, will embrace tncarly alienations and
every worthy effort of man as showing progress
In intellectual pursuits and Industrial develop
ment. These fifteen buildings In the aggregate
cover J28 acres â¢ af â¢â¢ floor space, -and their im
mensity* can be appreciated when It Is known
that the total acreage covered by the floors of
the Columbian Exposition, held ten years ago
In Chicago, covered only 82 acres. The largest
building is that Intended to house the displays
of agriculture. thU building being 500 feet wide
by 1600, feet long; or nearly as â¢ wide as two
.blocks and as long as five blocks of that por
tion of the city north of Market street. ,- Thirty
seven 'of the States 'are participating in* this
prand. exposition.^ ami it is estimated that the
aggregate 'expenditure _of- States and< foreign
countries.", added -t6'-. those' of I the 'eWorld's Fair
.management.* will* reach-, the', enormous* sum *of
$50, 000,000." Thltr is v nearly Â« twice ' a* ' much* as
the total amount expended for' preparation at
the Cnlcago exposition, which vas ?2S,000,000.
The splendid Â¦ and extensive grounds, which
irlve *n picturesqueness to the scene by reason
of ,thelr undulating Â¦ character, will be most
beautifully laid out... one of the most striding
features. being the terrace- garden* and cas
cades, back or which will be a bcrcen or per
istyle fitteen hundred feet long, with ft tower
at either end and ths grand festival hall rising
from the renter. It is Intended that the elec
tric illuminations shall eclipse everytnlng here
tofore undertaken on earth.
OUTLOOK IS ENCOURAGING.
The outlook for exhibits is mort than en
couragfnc'and we are advised that every foot
of available space I in Â¦ the grand exposition
bulldlnrs Is applied for two or three times
over and.- applications continue to come In.
Thft athletic and Interesting events and In
ternational-congresses will afford a continuous
ovation;
The city' of St. Louis has a population of
about feOO.OOO and extends about twenty miles
on the Mississippi River, ana covers sixty-two
â¢square: miles. It, is the center of many rail
rood systems; the trains of â¢ twenty-four lines
enter the Grand Union. Station of that city.
St. Louis has one of the finest railroad depots
ln> the .world, with thirty-two tracks, and
covers' eleven, acrea, of ground.
The- city hafc two splendid street railroad
systems and It is believed with the additions
and -Improvements being, made by both steam
and electric railroad companies ample facil
ities will D2 afforded for handling the thronirs
which will vl*lt ' thin world's congress. St.
Louis has to-day more than one hundred hotels
and many new ones are In course ;-t Construc
tion. One tn particular will be known as the
Inside Hotel and will he located innldc thÂ»
grounds, and !s calculated to accommodate 3000
guests. . Â» . -'
Times ' are good In thl3 city and they are
fairly, prosperous In the world. All Americans
are proud of the Louisiana purchase and ot
the great results that have come from it.
Every indication, gives â¢ promise of the ex-,
'position being- a grand success. Th.e work of
preparation Is well advanced and there- Is lit
tle doubt that on the Cay set for Â©penlnsr.
May 1,' 1004, It will be nearer completion than
any world's fair eVer held. Foreign countries,
as - 1 have- intimated, are participating very
Â¦generously. .Germany,- England /and France
are each expending over $7<)O,00O in preparation
for their- 1 part-of.- the display, while > Brazil.
Mexico and Japan each . have appropriated
more than half a million dollars. When little
Japan, our. distant neighbor on\the west, and
In. which this country has a deep commercial
interest, sees fit to spend half a million dol
lars to exploit her : possibilities In America It
is certainly, important that San Francisco, the
port- of -America' nearest -to Japan, and the
great commercial center of America's Pacific
Coast, should put herself In evident and pre
pare to reap some of the benefits at this great
world's exposition.
MAYOR SCHMITZ SPEAKS.
When . Commissioner Â¦ Filcher had
concluded his very able speech, and
the applause had subsided. President
Symrnes announced the presence of the
Mayoxvand i there " were ; cries" from all
partsof the hall for the popular chief
executive. â¢ i. The ; Mayor- was unpre

SPEECH BY MR. DE YOUNG.
There, were cries for Mr. de Young
and the well known citizen , was called
upon by President Symmes to express
hi3 views. Mr. de Young was unpre
pared but made a very good speech.
He discussed the Isthmian and .Nlca
raguan canals and pointed out the im
portance of building the former. He
also approved of the plan to exhibit
the progress of San Francisco at the
coming world's fair and expressed his
willingness to contribute to its success.
In the course of his speech he said:
I think it is unfair to call upon me so-sud
denly. I came here to-night like the rest, of
you did. to listen to the able speeches of the
gt-ntlemen who were named to speak to-night
on the topic, "Shall San Francisco Exhibit at
the St. Louts Exposition?" and I heard the an
swer In your applause, that you ought to ex
hibit, and I agree with you. But the mest se
rlcus part of that question Is. -what are you go-
Ing to exhibit': Men and women; buildings of
the town? What are you going to exhibit? I
listened to the speakers, . and from their re
marks I gather that they suggest figures show
ing the depcslts in bank. It would be better
to show the deposits themselves. (Laughter.)
t But It is a serious question. What can a
great commercial city exhibit? A topographi
cal map? Yer.. that's a good thing; anybody
can make that. Whot can they exhibit? Well,
they forget a very important point. - They can
exhibit her manufactories. They are very im
portant. One cf the gtMUlemen who spoke to
night referred, to the mining exhibit of one
firm. In mining machinery it Is a well known
fact that we excel the. world; that in San Fran
ciscoâthe greatest machinery has been bu!!t. I
allude to the machinery that was built to mine
the Comstock. : *
â¢.We ought to make a great exhibit of mining
machinery and let the orders come back to us.
You will remember year? .ago we sent a carload
cf mining machinery across the continent' for
South Africa. %nd soon orders began to come
back to us. Then we had a strike; the molders
went out, and. in order to carry out our con
tracts, we had to send to Chicago, and soon
Chicago began to fill our contracts and soon
they captured our mining machinery busine^?
Gentlemen, we ought to make an effort to
make a great exhibit in that line.
Tttera are In this town 100 different kinds of
manufactories. You may not know it but it is
true. An effort should be made to show up this
character of the manufactories we have ThÂ»re
Is no reason in the world why we who stand
here at the open gate to the Qrlcnt and see the
goods that are used in that country. comÂ« from
\ul~ t 1 ' ,} V i ca ?\ mak Â« them In this city and

When the applause had concluded.
President Symmes ... announced that
there would be. no further speeches
and that the evening's programme was
at an 'end. The success of the annual
banquet was attested by the burst of
enthusiasm displayed by the metrfbers
and guests as they filed cut. The va
rious speakers were congratulated for
their able addresses and the merchants
agreed that it was one of the most
successful affairs of its kind ever held
by the Merchants' Association.

dVjne>at"Tiorne never receives full appreciation
until it has won foreign approval. From the
most ancient i times it was known that a
prophet Is not' without honor save in his own
country, in California we are so far away
from rivals that we have little opportunity
to measure ourselves by others and thertby
lrarn the true value of what we have achiev
ed.- The consequence Is we underrate our
fflvts. entf'are In the habit of speaking mock
ingly of our own work, as lf,1t were of no
Importance when compared with what has
been done In Chicago, New Tork and Boston.
Out of the custom ot attributing most
of our greatness to certain natural advan
tages of situation-, resources and climate,
white neglecting to give due credit to thÂ«
v.-ork of enterprlFing men and women among
us. we have developed a pernicious public
tentiment which serlouniy interferes with
every effort at rousing the community to un
dertake any great enterprise. When we cease
to brag on our climate and our big trees
and begin to direct the attention of the world
to the work that has been done here by hu
man energy and skill we will not only at
tain a higher prestige abroad, but. what is
of far mere importance, we will have a higher
degree of- public confidence at home and a
prouder civic patriotism, to appeal to In every
emergency that hereafter arises. â¢
HAVE MORE THAN CLIMATE.
Few people beyond the Uockles are aware
that there Is anything worth noting in San
Francisco beyond a climate, a Chinatown and a
Cliff House. They do not know what work his
betn dene by enterprising men In and around
San Francisco during the last fifty years. That
work, however, has been one of the marvcle of
human achievement. We can safely challenge
the attention cf the world to it in well nigh
every line cf human endeavor from building
railroads to writing poetry, from propagating
new varieties of truit to the construction of
peerless battleships, from the exploitation of
deep mines to the creation of new ideals of
beauty In music, in painting and in sculpture.
In short, within the last fifty years the men of
California have done more new things and more
great things than any equal population has
done in any other State of the Union" or any
other part of the world.
San Francisc-o In all her variety of. Industrial,
commercial, artistic and social activity ought to
be exhibited at' St. Louis comprehensively, mag
nificently and impressively as an illustration
of what American energy has produced In the
lifetime of a single generation. In all this time
we have done more erM talked less about it
than any other American community. We have
fallen into a habit of underrating our own work
and our own people, it is therefore important
that we put our city en exhibition side by side
with the great cities of ths Union so that we
may tee vriiere we stand and learn to rightly
appreciate not only our climate and our harbor,
but our merchant!), manufacturers, shipbuilders,
architects, artisans, bankers, artists and In
short f.ll of our fellow citizens. ' I am satisfied
that the result will be beneficial In every way,
and that we shall all have a truer civic patriot
ism and a more acnured confidence In the abili
ties and the virtues of our fellow citizens fnyn
having beheld their works formed In the ap
plause where they're extended.
SAN FRANCISCO'S GROWTH.
"What we can do. and how to do it,"
was. the subject of Willian H. Mill3 J
speech. He showed a deep knowledge
of, the conditions of this State and its
needs. He appealed to the citizens of
Ban Francisco to send an. exhibit to St.*
Louis that would fittingly represent
its progress, and the growth of the
queen city of the Pacific Coast. In
part he said:
What can San Francisco show? What are
we, capable of showing to the -world? In the
first place, we can show a condition of growth
and progress, and that is all, to 'a world's ex
position. AVe can show a condition of growth
and progrets almost unparalleled by any city
in the United States. .
What shall we exhibit? In theÂ» first place
the mest important matter is, we must exhibit
our harbor. You must have a harbor in order
to have a great commercial history.- and we
have undoubtedly the best harbor in the world.
What we want is to demonstrate that the pres
ent frontage Is not equal to the present de
mands of commerce â and not s equal to the
future. There Is plenty harborage here for a
city of five millions of people. That fact must
be demonstrated, and it can. be demonstrated
by a relief map, but In order to make that map
interesting you must show Tamalpais. with its
scenic beauty; Mount Diablo, the. State Uni
versity, the Lick Observatory, one of the prop
erties cf that university: the Stanford Univer
sity and If possible take in the 3800 acres of
magnificent forest which the State now owns
and now known as. the Big Basin Park. Let
me say there is no empire, no netlon in the
world that can boast In the ownership of an
object that will compare with the 3800 acres
which California owns and which are situated
in Santa Cruz County. ,Â¦
. The next thing that will be necessary Is to
represent the street transportation of this city,
and â¢ next is to represent the social life and.
religious opportunities, the educational advan
tages it possesses, and with Its two univer
sities to close to San Francisco we can show
that; â¢:'Â¦.-!â¢ ' . v Â¦ ; . : - -
QUOTES THE PRESIDENT.
Heaven has not lighted a great city here for
itself, 'but for the benefit of thoee. upon whom
that light -will shine, and one of the greatest
expositions ' of * this principle that-, has > been
made In modern times. Is -found -in President
Roosevelt's message published this morning,

eternal gods it shall be built and, the United
States Khali build It. v V . .... -
Mr. McNaught has said. we have exploited
our fruits and products. ,San Francisco can
exhibit all the products of California because
here they have their commercial expression.

President Symmes then dwelt upon
the necessity of an underground sys
tem of travel on Market street, the
preservation of the Twin Peaks district
for residences, the use of the Rincon
Hill district for manufacturing, the
urgert reed of a vast convention hall
and a great stadium, similar to the one
at the State University grounds.
ThÂ« speaker referred to the big con
ventions that have been held In this
city in the last ten years and declared
that th* people of San Francisco had
not learned the true value of these
jjatheringH.
BAD FEATURES ADVERTISED.
President Symmes then said that San
Francisco bad advertised its worst fea
tures Ir.stead of its best.
"But Chinatown," he continued, "has
lost its charm, because it .has been
whitewashed. We have advertised to
the Faloon-keer=er that he can conduct
his business here at a far less cost than
in other cities, and we have let the
country know of the demoralizing ef
fect? of horseracing which we counte
nance.
"It is our duty to devise a plan for
the next lifty years and do some of
the work each year.
"To-night It is our project to adver
tise our city at the St. Louis fair, for
all rations and all cities will be repre
sented there, and San Francisco must
not be left out."
President Symmes then introduced
John McNaught, who was scheduled to
speak on the topic, "'Why San Francis
co Should Make a Special Display at
the St. Louis Exposition."
Mr. MeNaught was given a hearty
reception when he arose to speak and
his remarks were frequently met with
applause. At the close of his address
the guests continued cheering for some
time and the speaker was compelled to
arise and thank his hearers for their
hearty reception.
In speaking on his allotted subject
Mr. McNaught said in part:
REASON FOR DISPLAY.
In undertaking to tell you why San Fran
cisco should mak? a display at the St. Louis
.Exposition I am not venturing to answer a
conundrum and you will not expect an answer
nor an argument novel enough to furnish you
an amusing surprise. The question, indeed, car
ries its answer with It as a foregone con
clusion, bring much the same as the question
which a maiden puts when she asks her lover,
"Why do you love me? To that question it Is
well understood the lover shall reply. "I love
you because I would be a blind fool if I didn't."
Bvtn bo must we answer: The reason why We
chould make an exhibit at St.. Louis is that
we rhali be blind fools If we don't.
The philosophy underlylnjt the relations or
men toward tbe competitions and struggles of
life h.i? had full and fine expression in the
argunvnt which Shakespeare in the play ot
"Trollus and Crr-ssida" puts into the mouth of
Ulysses when urging Achilles to cease sulking
in his tent and to take part . in the battles
around Troy:
No man "Is lord of anything.
Though in and of Mm there be much con
sisting.

San Francisco is a city of which Shakespeare
would have raid that "In and of it there la
much consisting." It holds tne strategic point
where the traffic of tht? richest, of continents
meets the commerce of the vastest of oceans;
it has a harbor capable of sheltering the fleet*
of the world; a climate unsurpassed; a tribu
tary country rich In every supply of industry
and of luxury; a population drawn from the
stroncest, the most resourceful and the most
artlttic of races; a wealth in proportion " to
population hardly exceeded by that of any
other tlty on the globe, and;' opportunities of
incalculable value springing not from the con
ditions of a day, but inherent' in the very na
ture of things. All of these advantage?, how

Four hundred and fifty gentlemen,
representing *the commerce of San
Francisco, aieembJeS last evening at
thp sixth annual banquet ot the Mcr
Â«.hants' Association of this city, held
at the Palaco Hotel. .
The gathering was a notable one In
every respect. Prominent bankers, im
porters, merchants, producers, manu
facturers and representatives, of every
class of industry met at the banquet
table, all imbued with but one ideaâ
that the advantages and resources of
San Francisco must be advertised to
the world and especially so at the
forthcoming World's Fair at St. Louis
- The barquet was set for 6:30 p. m.
and the guests assembled in the par
lor on the first floor of the Palace Ho
tel and enjoyed business and social
converse.
When th-? announcement was made
that dinner was ready the merchants
and their friends marched to the. la
dies' grill room on the ground floor, the
scene of the banquet.
The room presented a brilliant ap
pearance. Extending the entire length
of. the room on one side vas the main
table, where the officials of the Mer
chants' Association and the principal
guests were allotted Beats. â¢
From th<Â» main table thirteen tables
were set at ripht angles, extending
across the large room.
ELABORATE DECORATIONS
The decorations were entirely in red.
Silver candelabra were s&t at intervals
en the banquet board, the lighted can
dles being shaded with red silk hang-
Ing?. Quantities of red carnations and
autumn leaves were artistically placed
upon the tables. Â»
At one end of the room were draped
two American flags and behind the
chair of the president of the associa
tion was displayed a large map of the
Â¦norld. showing San Francisco as the
cr-nter of commerce.
President Frank J. Symmes of the
Merchants* Association was supported
on his right by Mayor Schmltz. WS II.
Mills and F. \V. Dohrmann. and on the
left cf the president were seated J. A.
Filcher. Commissioner of California to
the World's Fair, and John McNaught.
manager of the San Francisco Call.
Prominent city officials and officers
of the Merchants' Association were also
ppatcd at the main table.
A superb dinner was enjoyed by the
guests and th<* wines were exclusively
California products. An artistic pro
gramme of music was rendered during
the serving <^f the feast and the guests
gave themselves uj> to discussing the
delicacies furnished by the chef and
Interlarding the meal with pleasant
conversation.
DWELL OS ONE TOPIC.
A feature of the gathering was the
limitation of the number of speakers.
Tho committee of arrangements made
a decided hit with the guests by not
furnishing a Ions list of toasts to be
responded to.
An innovation wa? made in having a
few prominent citizens discuss one giv
en topic and that was "San Francisco's
Display at the St. Louis Exposition in
190*."
In addition to President Symmes. the
speakers o% the evening were W. H.
Mills. J. A. Filcber, . John McNaught,
Mayor Sehmitz and M, H. de Young.
The addresses of the speakers of the
evening were listened t6"witn rapt at
tention and were rewarded with con
siderable applause. The guests were
carried away by enthusiasm . when
lome of the speakers told of the great
work done by the residents of San
Francisco and all seemed to get a bet
ter understanding of the main idea pro
mulgated that the resources and ad
vantages of the city should be properly
advertised to the many millions of
people that will gather in St. Louis at
the forthcoming exposition from every
quarter of thÂ« civilized world.
PRESIDENT SYMMES SPEAKS.
It was close upon 9 p. m. when Presi
dent Symmes arose and called the
guests to order. President Symmes
vas received with loud applause and in
addressing the gathering said in part:
Gentlemen. Distinguished Quests and Mem
bers of the Merchants' Association: It is with
rreat pleasure that I welcome you to this bixth
annual dinner cf our association. It is net
that we are only elx years old.'but in our early
days we were not placed to enjoy so bountiful a
lesrt bx we have had f-t before us to-m.?b.t v
The Merchants' Association is good and
rtrong and very healthy, and we think that San
Francisco should be proud of this organization.
It is composed of good rtock and has been well
brought up under the guidance of He father.
Mr. Dohrinann. and the board of directors and
our w-tretary, Mr. King. .
The Merchants' Association has passed
through mauy trials. It is not well to boast,
neither Is it well to hide our Ucht under a
busty 1. In the last year we have completed
three good things in particular, consisting of
the public' convenience on Stockton street, the
farety Â»itation at Third and Market streets and
the widening of Third street.. â¢ ; .
In the widening of Third street our associa
tion did most valuable work, and . the capacity
of travel on that street has been doubled.
Another important work has been the estab
lishment of the charitable, indorsement com
mittee, which has caved considerable money, to
the merchants and has kept funds away from
undeserving beggar*.
Let uÂ» now turn our attention to -the future.
It iÂ« the tntPOiion of the Merchants' Associa
tion to aid In the proper expenditure of the
bond issue voted by the people, amounting to
Sl*,0CU,000 We again pledge our devotion to
the civil service reform and to keep an eye on
th* Civil EervW Commission and to see that
every department of the city government must
live up to ite principles.
It t* npreesary that some one or some organ
ization murt look out for the, common good.
This aevociaticn is organized ' to make San
Francisco cleaner, better locking and better be
hsved. - â¢ Â¥ - â¢ .' . \
The bigger, the. city the less the average cit
izen do"* hlÂ« civic duty, hence' the need of
this associat'en. . There are two kind* of hon
ert men before the public, men financially
honest and men morally voand. . Men are
needed who do not use their office for the
benefifof their friends or to reward 'polltlc&l
service?.. Men are 'needed who aro honest all
through. tuch men the city will not
te rebbed'er its eervants corrupteJ,
" HOXEST 3IEX ARE XEEDED.
It is difficult to find honest men, hence there
f s fo ' rouÂ«*i corruption. The men who are
needed In civic coi-ernmcnt are men' who have
no ax to grind. I do not mean to say that
there Â«.re net honest men in civic Government
or In larce corporations, but we realize that
en* crooked man may corrupt a City Council
or the directors of a corporation.
If we denire to reform conditions we must
commence at home. Let each man reform
himself and he will reform others.
If our city is rot. well governed it is be
cause the common " people fall In their -civic
duty. Every citizen rnurt do hln.jiroper duty.
He accept* the benefit* of #over*iraent. - but
lie Is not willing to do his duty. This Is
shown by the recent election when one-third
of the voters went to the i>olls to vote on the
cxiÂ»Â«?nd1ture of $18/Â»00,M>tÂ».
We trÂ« her* to-night to review cur clans
for the future. ".We rawt look . In advance.
The ploocers did not build this city lor mil-
lions; they never realized - that such a thing
wii r.'sslble. But we do and we must work
for th*. Greater San Francisco of fifty or one
hundred years henre.
, Wo rhould consider what San Francisco
to dilate upon the speechrs that have been
made to-nlsht. or to take up your ttrne. Th#
ground- has been thoroughly covsn-ti. but I
want to say in conclusion that am a native Â»on.
born of one of thÂ« pioneers of this city, wno
always had the welfare ot the city at heart.

club for some years to.uive an evening
reception once a year, when gentlemen
are numbered "among those present."
This year, in commemoration of the
club's tenth birthday, an elaborate
dinner was decided upon. Everything
was perfectly appointed and the rooms
were decorated with a profusion of
foliage and Chinese lanterns. The
guests were seated around small tables
and numbered 125. 'The members were
nearly all present, w-ith charming
smiles and beautiful gowns. The gen

members and a few friends. An in
formal and entertaining programme
followed, the dinner and the evening

in charge of arrangements were Major
Todd, Â¦lieutenant Covington, Lieuten
ant -Siphef, Captain Nance and Lieu
tenant Camp.
It was also suggested by Mr. Briggs
that advertisements of California
should be inserted in several thousand
Eastern newspapers. He would also
have maps of California sent out with
matter on them pointing out the. ad
vantages of California and also copies
of a flashlight view of the exhibition
hall of the board that was taken while
the delegates, to the National Bankers'
Association were in the hall, these to
be given to the bankers to.be hung in
their banking houses in the East.
Messrs. Chipman, Wooster and others
discussed these propositions. Great in
terest was manifested 'as .Â¦ the '/plans
were unrolled for making the work of
the board wider and more effective for
the good of the State.
Manager Briggs suggested several
practical ways to Increase interest in
the work qtf the board. He proposed
that when Hie time comes for the hold
ing of the annual meeting of the board
representatives from all the counties in
the State should be invited to com? to
the city and attend, luncheon to be
served In the exhibition hall . of the
board, 'the work of the board and its
relations to the encouragement of th*.
interior to be the theme for discussion.
A deal of business was transacted by
the board during a long session. Mrs.
I A. D. Sharon, representing the Califor
nia Club, requested the board to urge
i favorable consideration at the hands of
| the Speaker of the House of Represent
; atives and of the House Conmiittee on
j Rules of Congress for the bill relating
j to the preservation of the Calaveras
! big tree grove. It was voted to address
I a letter to Speaker Cannon on the sub
! Ject. -T
Various suggestions were " put into
resolutions and adopted. One was to
have the secretary of the board write a
bulletin on the dairy Industry of Cali
fornia. It was decided to send a com
munication to the Xew York Board of
Trade and Transportation favoring the
building up, of the American merchant
, marine. Secretary Stearns of the Oalc
!and Board of Trade reported concern
ing the proposed tule industry on the
.marches about Oakland that manufac
turers had offered to pay from $30. to
(40 per ton for all the tules that could
be Â©reduced of the proper size and in
prime condition for material to mak;:
mattresses.
Still another resolution, Introduced by
President Chipman. set forth that one
of the purposes of the board is to sup
ply to California farmers useful infor
mation, ar.d that a committee of three
should be appointed to confer with the
president of the University of Califor
nia and Professor Hllgard to determine
whether the board in:2ht not estab
lish some relations with the university
to the mutual advantage of all con
cerned. The Durpose of this, as ex
plained, was to furnish to the public
at larce in popular form the informa
tion derivable from the college of ag
riculture connected with the univer
sity. This resolution, like the others
mentioned, was adopted. '
Several other resolutions introduced
by President Chipman were adopted.
One of these instructed the committee
on industrial resources to investigate
and report concerning industries that
are partly developed and are retarded
in their growth -by lack of knowledge
of the best methods of production and
of markets awaiting their output.
Another directed the committee on
immigration to investigate and report
concerning the extent of the increase
of the population of California during
the decade ending in 1900 and since, so
far as practicable, to determine what
proportion of this increase has been
added to towns and cities and in the
country, respectively; also the regions
of the State and the counties in which
the population has been Increased and
the causes that have led to the choice
of location made by the new popula
tion; also "to ascertain the principal
inducements that have operated and
are operating to bring settlers into the
State; afso what ihe causes are, if any
exist, why counties possessing great
attractions for the homeseeker are net
receiving their share of immigration to
the State."
President X. P. Chipman introduced
at a meeting of the State Board of
Trade yesterday a resolution calling for
a convention to be held" In Sacramento
at ajj early day for the purpose of call
ing the attention of Congress to the
â¢necessity for the improvement of the
navigation of the Sacramento .and San
Joaquin rivers.'
In a preamble it was set forth that
the attention of the State Board of
Trade had been called to the fact that
due regard has not been paid to the
improvement of navigation on the
streams named: that during the last
summer navigation on the Sacramento
River to Red Bluff closed on July 7.
and a month later ceased at Squaw
Hill, 174 miles above Sacramento, and
was not resumed to the latter place
until December 3; that navigation was
closed by failure of the Government to
provide for clearing the channel from
merely temporary obstructions; thaj.
the failure of the Government to secure
to the inhabitants of the Sacramento
and San Jeaquin valleys the full and
free enjoyment of navigation of these
important waterways has retarded and
Is retarding the growth and develop
ment of a large and important region
of California and is a matter of ee
rious moment.
The resolution was as follows:
R^olveJ. That the secretary be directed to
arrtnre for a public meeting to be held at the
city of Sacramento at an early day, to consider
and adopt such measures as may brine to thf
attention of the Congress of the United States
the urgent need for more intelligent and liberal
treatment of these rivers than has heretofore
beÂ«i given them; that* the Sacramento Valley
Development Association, county boards of Su
pervisors, city and town Trustees and Council
men and local boards of trade and chambers 0'
commerce ut the several coum!e9, towns and
titles of l*ie Sacramento and San Joaquin val
leys and the commercial bodies of the cities
of San Francisco and Oakland be requested to
send delegates to said convention, to take part
in its deliberatlcns and aid ln perfecting some
means to secure the required and speedy action
of Congress.
The daylight burglars who have been
operating for the last .two weeks in the
Western Addition, entered the residence
of Mrs. "Abraham Hoffman at 1720 Eddy
street Sunday afternoon and while loot
ing the* house were frightened away by
Miss Minnie Steinhart) a sister of Mrs.
Hoffman. The burglars rang the fuont
door bell before thsy commenced oper- .
atlons and, being"; certain.' that .ho" one
was home, entered through a.reaVwin-,
dow, which they, pried open ;"with â¢ Â£
jimmy. The captain of .detectives "was
notified, but no clew as, to who the
thieves are has j-et been found. ' â¢ â¢
Mrs. Hoffman and: her sister left the
house early in the. afternoon for the
purposÂ£ of making a vii.lt. Miss Stein
hart was the first to return, reaching
home a few minutes before 5 o'clock.
When she entered the. rear apartments
she. discovered the ,visit of the thieves
and summoned a neighbor. 'Two rooms
were in a state; of disorder ; and gave
evidence of 'a ;hasty . and", interrupted
search. 'Trunks were .open- and their
contents .scattered 1 .about. Bureau
drawers and closets had been ran
sacked. The thieves secured! a riumoei'
of â¢ silver toile t articles. . various < pieces
of clothing and a small amount of coin.
-A number of children who were play
ing on the, Iront steps of the house say
that' two strange men rang the "front
door bell about twenty minutes to 5
o'clock. After lingering a minute or
two and receiving no response, they'
walked down the stairs- and passed
around to the rear of the house. Hard;
ly had they begun operations Inside the
house, when Miss Steinhart cameJiome.
.When she entered the front door the
crooks beat a hasty retrea\ through
the rear "window with the loot they had j
gathered up.- .: :_ , _ .. H
Judge Cook received a communication
yesterday from Dr. Elmer E. Stone,
medical superintendent of the- Xapa
Insane Asylum, inclosing a certificate
that Mrs. Etta Fitzgibbon ' was per
fectly sane. The Judge made- an order,
as the woman hadbeen discharged as
sane, that the Sheriff. of, this. city and
county. take her into custody 'and bring
her into court on" Saturday for sen
tencel Â¦ â¢ . '
In his letter. Dr. Stone Eays: "I did
not see any evidence of. insanityin the
woman,, and believe her Â¦to. be a de
generate of the criminal. type, and fur
ther I believe' that she is at all -times
capable of distinguishing between right
and wrong and' should, -therefore,- be
punished for the crime she commit
ted." . /
Mrs. Fitzgibbon shot five bullets into
Joseph E. Qagaii, a young man living
at 17. Franklin street, in her rooms at
S73 Market street on May 3 last... She
claimed that Gagan had insulted her.
but Gagan emphatically, denied it and
said that' the shooting wasentirely un
provoked. For weeks he lay hovering
between life and death,. but ultimately
recovered^
TVhen the case came up for trial
before a Jury in Judge Cook's Court,
the Judge was not satisfied as to the
woman's sanity, and she was sent to
the insane ward in the Central.Emer
gency Hospital for qbservation. She
Avas declared sane and her trial was
proceeded with. She was : convicted of
assault to commit murder, but her at
torney again raised the question as to
her sanity, and on October 9 she was
committed to the Insane Asylum/ at
Xapa, her sentence being suspended*
meantime. . < * . *
Mrs. Fitzglbbon takes j unusual.de
light in shooting men. Four years, ago,
while she was living on Grant-ave
nue, she fired several shots at George
Bowers, a grocery clerk, because she
alleged he had insulted her. Bowers
was not hit, but the woman was ar
rested for assault to murder. At that
time she was committed to the Insane
Asylum and was discharged in about
a year.

Taking it for granted that between
the former lesson and this our pupil
has been working faithfully at his
scale according to the explanation al
ready given, by this time, in all prob
ability, he has become familiar enough
with the pir.gle-octave scale, in its
Flow form, to take up the two-octave
scale and increase hie velocity at the
same time.
Now. let him play his single octave
through once, with the right hand,
saying "ope. two," slowly, at each
count relaxing between every two
notes as usual. As soon as he finishes
the ascending and descending scale, he
must start again, still counting "one,
two," as before., but- this time the
count "two" falls 0*1 the next note, in
stead of having both counts belong to
the same note, and thus the time is
systematically doubled.
The pupil counts "one, two," "one,
two," "one, two," straight on up the
scale, for two octaves, but "*me" falls
on C, "two" on D, the next "one" on
E, the next "two" on F, the next "one"
on G, and so on.
The counts must all be as regular as
ever â just the same amount of time
between each, but the accent is only
given at every other note â that is,
every time*"one" is said, the pupil em
phasizes that particular note, impart
ing a ringing tone to it, as much as is
possible, while the alternate note in
group (signified each time by the
count "two") is struck lightly, by
means of whatever strength is left
over from the forcible count "one."
The effect of this is similar to that
produced in ringing a bell by pulling
the rope attached to it. There are two
sounds, the first one, which is strong,
and a direct consequence of the
strength of the pull given to the rope,
and the second, which is almost like
an echo of the firyt. as the bell re
turns to its place. There is the same
space of time allowed each sound, but
the second tone is much softer, while
the strength of the one stroke' Is
enough to carry the sound through to
the end of the second note.
The pupil will see, as he tries this,
that he is emphasizing just exactly as
he did Jn his first scale, only that there
is a note between each of the ac
cented notes, thus making him play
twice as rapidly as before, although
his counting is no more rapid.
The boy must watch his fingers and
listen to his counting at all times, lest,
with this unusual method of accent
ing, his playing becomes in the least
uneven. When carefully watched he
can acquire by this method a remark
ably clear, Fwcet-toned. rapid scale in
a short time. If. however, he becomes
careless, forgets to notice details "and
trusts to the 'accent alone to help him
through, he is liable to create an effect
somewhat likÂ« that produced by the
hoofbeats of a horse who is afflicted
with "string halt." Therefore, let our
little boy keep his mind entirely on
what he is doing, and all disaster will
be avoided. If he is careful to hold
the softer note exactly as long as the
loud one, there Is no chance of his los
ing the rhythm, and all will be well.
When he comes to the end of the
first octave he proceeds up the scale
by using his first finger (thumb) in
stead of the little one,, on the upper C,
and is thus safely started on the sec
ond octave. ,>.;.
. If any doubt is felt as to Just how
this is done, let the pupil go hack to
the Jast. lesson, where the movements
of the passing fingers are fully explain
ed, and exercises for the facilitation of
this particular difficulty given. It is
â¢well to iro back to the other lessons
every little while anyway, so as to keep
all the important points fresh in the
pupil's mind. Each exercise is a help
to the others, and the more they-, are
all practiced the better will be the re
sult
In practicing the two-octave scale,
the .pupil will be unable to use the
circle (relaxing) motion between the
notes as in the single octave scale, for
there is not time with the Increased
velocity; but he can accomplish the re
quired relaxation by""tnlnking the mo
tion each time he has struck a note;
and by this time the relaxing will have
become such a natural thing to him
that If he remembers to think "relax
ing" hia muscles will keep from tight
ening, lust exactly as if he actually
went through the whole motion.
This does not mean, however, that
he can give up his relaxing exercises.
On the contra oV they are' more and
more necessary as he begins to play
more rapidly: but he. uses them on the
slow scale only, aif the rhythm of the
rapid scale mu6f^ot be interfered with.
In order to insure against any tight
ening of the muscles it is best to prac
tice the single octave scale (with the
relaxing motion between every two
notes) in connection with , the two-oc
tave scale, first one and then the other, '
over and over again.
If there is an inclination to tighten
the muscles bv.the time the pupil
reaches the top of the second octave,
he may. stop there just long enough to
relax once before beginning the de
scent; but do. not allow this unless it
Is absolutely necessary, as it . is desir
able-to acquire the habit of making the
ascent and descent without a break as
soon as possible.

THE State Supreme Court, in r Katz et als. vs. Walkin
shaw, has decided certain issues of very great in-;
terest to a large nut^bej, of our., citizens/ The
decision was rendered.: ;ori;;a .rehearing, '.the case having
been decided before in ..an- opinion of -the court written
by the late Justice Ja'ckson Temple,*- which opinion ms
now reaffirmed by the "full bench.' ' .'
A The issue relates tp the ownership arid^use of ground
waters, regardless of. whether they exist in- an : under
ground stream or inverted, clones or â¢ gravel beds. It )
being contended that' each' Jand owner owns absolutely j
the percolating waters under, his, la'nd,.' with, the' right ;tp j
use or* dispose of them as he pleases, is partM0fthe.c.p'ihr
mon law/ on all fours with the common iaw\. right *6i
j-iparian .proprietors, the courf holds' that suctfpartV of
the common law as are not adapted .to our conditions
arc not in force here, because tjiey fit physical conditions
widely different from oiirs. The true ddctrine^s held to
be that the common law, by its own principles, adapts
itself to varying conditions and/.is modified -so as to
serve the ends of justice under different circumstances.
A rule of law applicable to the fresh* water streams of
England may be. wholly inapplicable to the. same char
acter of streams in this country, because, of different
capacity, or because the adjoining cotintry. furbishes , a
commerce for them unknown in England,- in which case
the, common law modifies its rules, upon its" own prin
ciples, to conform'to tjic wa.nts of , the community.
The court elaborately states the difference between
conditions here, in respect"t'o^waters and. their uses,. and
in England. In a large" parUof California, and especially
in the southern half of ;,thj?* State, with Some exceptions
insufficient to serve, as^, the basis of. .community life,
artificial irrigation's necessary, and has been customary
ever since Spanish . The court; notes the ex
tension of irrigation ..spulh^ of ; the Tchachapi, where a
series of wet years encouraged the bringing under till
age, or planting to vines. and fruit trees, of an area so
extensive that in the .succeeding dry years there was
not water enough to rnaintairi the fertility, and it was
demonstrated that the 3 surface streams Iwcre insufficienfc
Then began the search for .percolating ground waters
by artesian wells, horizontal. tunnels, pumping and every
other available means to 'increase the supply from below;
ground and keep the land from lapsing from tillage. As i
the population is rapidly increasing, the struggle for
greater, and it becomes the duty of the courts
to inquire whether the owner who, by use of ground
waters, has irrigated his land 'and made, it fruitful can
be protected in that use, or whether a later comer can
intercept his supply and destroy the property and the
value it has created.
Â¦ The, defendants contended that no property right to
ground water exists in the land owner except while
they : are in his soil, and that he has no. right to have
them continue to pass into his land,* or to prevent them
being drawn tout of his land by an interference with
natural condition^ on 'adjoining land. -His right, there
fore, could not be protected nor enforced, and he would;
be" in constant peril of the loss of all property that
depended on his use of the percolating waters in his:
own soil. The court says that if this rule is the law, or '
no law, of the land,- it would bring in peril the property
of the. defendants themselves, since if they may inter-,
cept Hhc ground waters of another, or draw them out
of his land,, the same may be done to ..them, and it is
impossible to see how a doctrine offering;no protection
at all to property that depends on the use of water can
tend to promote future developments, or -preserve those
already' made, and, therefore,-' such a doctrine is not
consistent) with public policy, or conducive'. to the general
welfare. /M-
The court reaffirms Judge Temple's, opinion, there
fore, and declares not only ownership* in. the. landholder
of ground waters, but the right of action .protect
himself against .interception or other ..interference with
that property in water* This is modified by the rule of
reasonable use, which also applies to surface waters!
Under this decision the land owner cannot be deprived
of. bis, ground waters, either, to irrigate, the lands of
others or to create a supply of potable water for a city
population. No later comer has the right to sink wells
or make subterranean intercepting dams to draw off,
divert or intercept his supply.
The. decision is of great interest to- the planters of
the Santa Clara VaHey, and other parts- of Central and
Northern 'California, as well as to those in. the South.
. The defendants in the case made .the point that
Justice ;Temple\s decision would apply to .oil lands,, but
the 'court especially meets this by- showing that oil is
not mined to' apply to 'the surface of the [laifd/ nor does
it percolate from that- surface to' its ground reservoirs.
-The court, therefore, says that, in any'coritrovery over
oil, it will follow the decisions rendered in th'e oil States,
inasmuch -as . California". shares with them ;the physical
features, , and the legal principles applicable to them.
But. Â¦in A respect to ground waters, our ; physical -features
are-peculiar and* individual to -this State, and we do not
share them . with States) oV countries" where .abundant

Spirited Race.
Much interest was excited in England
recently In a contest between the sister
cruisers Medea and Medusa, which was
undertaken for the boiler committee,
to test two different types of water
boilers, and was concluded on Monday
morning, when both ships arrived at
Plymouth at an early hour after a race
from Gibraltar. The Medea is fitted
with the Yarrow large tube boiler and
the Medusa with the Dhurr. On the
way out to Gibraltar the Medea waa
able to run for five hours longer than
the Medusa, both ships starting with
the same quantity of coal and working
at the same horse-power. On the run
home four boilers In each ship were
working to their utmost horse-power.
After leaving Gibraltar on Friday, the
Medusa soon obtained a lead of half a
mile and, maintaining her advantage
throughout, won by : three minutes.
During Friday three of the fans of the
Medea failed to act properly and by
Sunday morning the Medusa was lead-
Ing by nine miles. The Medea's fans
having been repaired, she began to
gain on her rival and the distance sep
arating the two ships was gradually
lessened until 9 o'clock on Sunday
evening the Medea was only three
quarters of a mile astern. But the ves
sel failed to overhaul the Medusa,
which rounded the Eddystone at five
minutes, after midnight, the Medea fol
lowing five minutes later. Allowing for
the Medusa's start, she actually won by
three minutes.
Care of a Pump.
To care properly for a pump one
must understand <its mechanism and
the principles Involved which cause it
to lift water. In mine pumps there are
two sets of valves, known' as suction
arid discharge valves; If either set of
valves is out of order the efficiency of
the pump will be decreased. , The sur
face of all water exposed to the air has
the pressure of the atmosphere upon It;
therefore, if one end of Â¦ a 'tube Is
closed by a valve and the other end
lowered into water, It will be pos
sible to cause the water to rise in thÂ«9
tube by drawing the air 'out of It. ThÂ»
plunger of the pump, by creating a
vacuum in the suction pipe, draws the
water up until it passes into the pump
through the suction valves. If the
suction pipe Is not air tight, or if the
suction valve leaks, the plunger cannryt
draw water, from which It follows that
the efficiency of a pump depends upon
the suction mechanism, and that must
be made air tight so that no air enters
the suction pipe from above the valves.

PUBLIC sentiment cognizes the issues arising in
the excessive organization of labor, and capital as
among the" burning .questions of the day. The
enormous foreign immigration, mainly composed of
people who do not speak our language, and"\vh6 are not
schooled in our institutions, and who come not from
any sentimental attachment to our principles of.govern
ment, makes an annual" increment to our population
equal to the annual vacancy to be filled in our industrial
life. Its presence crowds out just that number of our
oWn people who have arrived at the age of self-support.
This process gives us a supply not trained in .self
government and piijs out of useful occupation an equal
number of our own people, who, in bur public schools,
have learned lessons of independence winch they are not
permitted to apply to the great issues ,of life., So we
get industrial disorders that have all the violent fea
lurts of warfare. On the other, hand, . capital, with the
mass of immigration to work on^ .which it finds capable
of exploitation to an extent that would not be possible
with independent native labor,' meets organization' with
organization, and both sides at times forget their
allegiance to the country and their; subjection to the law.
None of his just and sensible countrymen- has ever
doubted the President's sincere devotion* to the prin
ciple of equality of right and of opportunity, and equal
subjection to the law. In his message he deals with this
issue with his usual fearlessness and candor, arid it
will be well for all concerned to : read and remember
what he says. It will produce the liveliest satisfaction in
the third party, the unorganized majority, the great body
of citizens v who want justice, but who, because of the
lack of a single medium of expression^ are ruthlessly ex
ploited by both parties to the excessive organization of
labor and capital. No other statesman has put more
clearly the purpose and function, of the Federal Gov-'
ernmerit than the President states it in these terms:
"The consistent policy of the National Government,
so far as it has the power, is to hold in check the un
scrupulous man, whether, employer or employe; but , to
refuse to weaken individual initiative, or to hamper or
cramp the industrial development of the country. We
recognize that this' is an era- of federation and com
bination, in which great capitalistic combinations and
labor unions have .become factors of tremendous im
portance in -all 'industrial centers. Hearty recognition
is .given. the far-reaching .'beneficent work that has been
accomplished - through both corporations and labor
unions, and the line as between different corporations
and different -unions* is. drawn as it is between different
individuals;- that is, it is drawn on conduct, the effort
being to treat both organized capital and organized labor
alike, asking nothing, except that the interest of each
shall be brought into harmony with the interest of the
general public, and^that the "conduct of each shall c6n
form to the. fundamental rules of obedience to law, of
individual freedom, and of justice and fair dealing to all.
Whenever either corporation,, labor union or individual
disregards the law, â¢Â¦ or acts in a spirit of arbitrary and
tyrannous interference .with the rights of others, whether
corporations or individuals,^ then, where the Federal
Government has jurisdiction, â¢, it will see to it that the
misconduct is stopped, paying not the slightest heed tar
the position or power of the' corporation, the' union of
the individual, but only to one vital factâ that, is the
question whether or not therconduct- of the individual,
or aggregation of individuals/ is in accordance with the
law of the land. Every man must be guaranteed his
liberty and his right to do as, he likes with his property
or his labor, so long as he does not infringe the rights
of others. No man is above the law and no man is
below it; nor do we ask any man's permission when we
require him to obey it. Obedience to the law is de
manded as a right, not asked as a favor."
That is a refreshing and timely restatement of the
supremacy of the law, .and of its power to protect indi
vidual rights, the privilege of private contract ana the
rights and uses of property.' It should, be translated
into the Babel of tongues, spoken by our incoming mil
,lions of immigrants, and, as the illiterate are in a
majority, it should be read and expounded to them. Then
their habit of dragging the .American flag in the 'dirt,
as has been recently done by the foreign miners in
Utah, would be checked. To American capitalists and
corporations' it needs no translating nor expounding. It
is notice to them that there is a line of law drawn
between gains and guilt, and that tra'de has its right
to freedom as well as men, and must not be restrained
to satisfy the" spiritof avarice and greed.
This part of the message is properly supplemented by
the* recommendations on-; immigration, separating it into
the right and the wrong kind, and asking that the law
exclude the latter more rigorously than now. The evil
of! congested, immigration is' noted,, and the demand, is
made that more attention be, given Jo its distribution.,
No doubt if* it were spread over the country and y pre
vented lodging' in masses where our language is" not
learned nor spoken, and essentially foreign customs are
stubbornly maintained, the process of digesting and
assimilating would, produce less disturbance.

scale, which will take the pupil up
three octaves. â¢'â-;Â¦ ";
The same rule of progression applies
at the end of each octave; that is, to
substitute the thumb for the fifth'fin
ger and "start anew, whether the desti
nation be two, three or four octaves.
We are now about to make' a notice
able increase in tempo, and to accom
plish this the pupil must play three
notes to a count instead of two as in
the two-octave scale.
He must. count "one." "two" all the
way up, accenting on the "one," just
as before, and counting in exactly the
same time as beforeâ no faster and no
slower. In this case) however, "two"
falls' on F, making three notes to a
count. Thus, C. D, E fall on "one"; F,
G, A fa'.l on "two"; B, C, D fall on
"one"; E, F. G fall on "two," and so
on, until the end of the third octave Is
reached, and the pupil returns as he
came, without a pause, until he again,
reaches middle C.
At first he will need much relaxing
after his long journey of three octaves
and back â in fact, it would be well to
let him stop playing entirely for a
moment after finishing the use of the
â¢â¢water motion," as the rest will be of
great advantage to him at this June-,
ture.
Don't forget to go back to first prin
ciples every little whileâ it is impor
tant now, as at all times. ,
In this three-octave scale the pu
pil's arm should be particularly free.
In a frequent, natural progression
up or down the scale as the case may
be. the wrist plays a great part,, mov
ing continuously up or down the key
board to assist the' fingers to go over
or under, and at the same time hold
ing itself in a parallel position and
perfectly relaxed. In other words,
its position is almost identical with,
that of the wrist in the "water mo
tion," and as the scales become more
and more rapid the similarity between
the two motions is more marked. 1 In
fact, in a very rapid scale the wrist
glides quickly from one end of the
piano to another, while the notes fall
from the tips of the fingers Just like
drops of water. ; â¢ -
Thus it will be seen that 'the "wa
ter motion" is to be more and more of
a help as time goes on; in fact, scale
playing is only-one of many things
â¢wherein its great benefit will be
proved.
Right here I want *to. remind^oxxr
pupil not to forget the necessity of
raising his fingers, as quickly as possi
ble, whether in a fast or slow scale.
It is very important. in rapid. playing,
if one wishes to acquire a clean, clear
cut "tone;- Remember" this, "not once,
but ever>' time. v
Also watch the hand to see that It
is keeping its proper position. Go
back to the "hand shaping" exercise
once in a while, comparing the "per
fect playing position" with^the posi
tion of your hand when you are in the
midst of your scale, and if the result
is not perfectly satisfactory keep at it
until it is. - â¢
Â« â¢ " ?' "
A good aid to melodious and rhyth
mic scale playing will be found in the
metronome, if prudently and Judicious
ly used. Mark my qualification, how
ever, for unless the^instrument is used
understanding^', it is harmful rather
than advantageous.
It should never be used in playing, or
Jn practicing pieces when taken as a
whole, although when working out any
knotty little piece it is of great help
when used in the right way. \
Its original use was to set the proper
time at which pieces of music were to
be played, and the little numbers are
often to be found at the top of a sheet
of music, showing the desire of "the
composer in this respect. I shall ex
plain all this more fully later .on. For
our present needs it is sumcient to say
that the metronome is a time-beater,
which one winds up like a clock and
which beats rapidly or slowly at the
will of the student, by raising or low
ering a little weight on the pendulum,"
easily adjusted by the finger.
In working ud scales to greater and
greater-velocity, I know of nothing else
of so much assistance to the pupil; and
it docs not tend to make the
playing mechanical in the very least
when used for this purpose and ho
other. -:.v*
A good Maelzel metronome (to.be
purchased at any music store) costs
only $3 or ?4 and will last a lifetime.
I strongly advise one for our little pu
pil and he may begin to use it at once
in this way:
After wiirtllng up the metronome,
place the weight at the figure 50 and
start the pendulum going by. touching
it with the finger.
Fifty is a very slow countâ Just about
what the pupil has been counting in
his slow scale. Each time, the pendu
lum ticks,; he strikes a note, until he
has played one octave scale through
once. Then (while the metronome
still goes placidly on, he begins his
two-octave scale, Splaying two notes to
the tick - of the metronome, enipha-'
sizing every other note, "that is, the
ones that come on the stroke of the
metronome.

\Enrique Cano afforded considerable
amusement yesterdaY morning during
the progress of a Coroner's ' inquest
into the cause of death of Germain
Ventajou, a French laundryman who
committed suicide in the cellar of his
residence, 1014 Powell street, by cut
ting his throat with a razor. Cano was
one of the persons who found the body
on October 30, three weeks after, Venta
jou had dteappeared beyond the horizon
of the detective police. He intimated,
on the witness stand, that the police
might have had something to do with
Ventajou's untimely, ending and, with
many dramatic gestures .and. much
vehemence, declared that the police
were suspectable characters and, point
ing a finger at Detective Wren, added
that Wren was one of them.
It appeared from the testimony, that
three weeks 'before Yentajou's body
was found in the cellar, in an advanced
stage of decomposition, he had pur
chased p. quantity of new furniture
for the woman with whom he .was
living as his wife, and that on the day
of his disappearance he and the
woman had a quarrel,- in the course-of
which he struck her, with a chair. and
knocked her down. The. .woman was
removed to the French Hospital for
treatment. The police Searched for
Ventajou everywhere 'but in the cellar
of his own residence ajid, of course,
did not succeed' in finding him. In the
meantime all. the furniture was re
moved from the" house/ by whfcm or by
whose order, could not be learned by
the friends of the suicide. As soon as
the woman, who had passed aa" his wife,
recovered, she disappeared 'and all
trace of her was Most.Vsb" far as the
Coroner's office" wa*s "concerned. *
Cano appeared to think "that the de
tectives had had something to do > with
the disappearance of the -furniture,
but he was unable to give any grounds
for his suspicion: .'*

Berber recently made complaint to
the Society for the Prevention of Cru
elty to Children that Mrs., Bartels was
maltreating her. children. He claimed
that "she had pulled nearly all the hair
from her " stepdaughter Clara's head.
Numerous other neighbors made sim
ilar reports to the , society. Secretary
White and Officer McMurray of the so
ciety,, Investigated. the case last week
and found no evidence of any such cru
elty as was charged. Mrs. Bartels said
that the neighbors were persecuting
her and told the officers named that
she had.sent the children: to live with
Mrs. Thompson of 159 South Park.
She seemed to be very much un
nerved- by> the alleged ; persecution^df
her ; neighbors and tenants while talk
ing to Secretary White, but showed no
signs of insanity at the time. :1
She paid Mrs. Thompson for, the care
of her children and later' in , the I week
removed them to a Catholic, home,"
where they were .placed .in charge of
Father Scanlan.
The patrol wagon was summoned
and Policemen Riordan and Morrison
removed the woman to the Emergency
Hospital and later, on the advice of
Fire Marshal Towe, she was placed in
the detention ward of the Hospital for
the Insane.
The kitchen In which Mrs. Bartels
attempted to incinerate herself is but
six by eight feet and presented a gory
appearance, blood having flowed over
everything. The entire surface of the
four walls was burned to a crisp by
the hot flames of the coal oil. .
At the hospital the flow of blood from
the woman's wounds was stopped and
she was; placed under the Influence of
opiates* She slept most of the after
noon. She will be brought before the
Lunacy Commission in a few days and
will, in all probab^Ity, be committed
to an insane asylum.
In response to Fire Marshal Towe's
questioning, Mrs. Bartels tried to ex
plain that ahe did not set the house on
fire. "There is no fire," she said. "I
cut my wrists because I was desnjpn
dent." I want to die."
SAYS SHE IS PERSECUTED.
REMOVED TO HOSPITAL.
Russell seized a bucket of water and
with much difficulty succeeded in ar
resting the progress of the .fire. The
Fire Department responded to an alarm
and completed his work. In the excite
ment, while the rear door of the kitch
en was being broken down, Mrs. Bar
tels unlocked the front door and ran
out, screaming the while, and. speeded
up Stevenson, leaving a wake of blood
on the sidewalk from the gushing cuts
on her wrists. When. the bleedfng wo
man reached the corner of Market and
Seventh streets, she fell to the sidewalk
in a faint.
of fiendish glee. William Russell, a
Janitor in the Callaghan building. \^ho
lives in the flat below, heard "the
screams and.. hurrying to the scene, ar
rived in time to see Mrs. Berger break
ing in the door in the rear of the
kitchen.
. Mrs. M. F. Bartels. an elderly wo
man residing at 535% Stevenson street,
who is undoubtedly demented, attempt
ed to Incinerate herself in a little kitch
en at the rear of her house yesterday
morning. Prior to saturating the room
with coal oil and setting it on fire, the
insane woman cut the large arteries in
both of her wrists in a vain effort to
end her life. Driven from the raging
flames by the efforts of rescuers, she
fled along the street until her strength
waned from loss of blood and she sank
to the sidewalk in a faint.
The woman, according to the stories
of neighbors, has been acting queerly
for -some time. She owns the property
where she fives and lets out a store
and two houses. HÂ£r own house she
rents in part to roomers. She also owns
considerable property in San Jose, left,
by her first husband.
She had been in San Jose and re
turned recently to her home on Steven
son street-
Yesterday morning, between 10 and
11 o'clock, Mrs. George Berger, wife of
a barber, who occupies rooms in Mrs.
Bartels' house, discovered flames issu
ing from the landlady's kitchen and
heard the demented woman's screams

Louis "Rose, one of the firm, was
brought from his house and under
went a severe examination by the Fire
Marshal. He protested that he a and
his clerk, J. Berkman, locked up the
store early in the evening and attend
ed a dance on Sixteenth street, near
Church. He hinted at persecutors
and when asked if anything was miss
ing from the store said that some
hams were gone, officials did not
believe his story and are inclined to
think that some one connected with
or familiar with the place set it on
fire.
Fire. Marshal Towe scouted the idea
that any one from the outside would
ever take the time and trouble to \>ut
ty up all of the airholes in the cellar
before. starting the fire. Still further
he argued that there were no signs of
any one having broken into the store.
Berkman, the' other member of the
firm, is away at the present time. . The
Fire Marshal and other : officials, al
though they have no definite case as
yet against Rose, gave the Impression
that Â«they suspected him of the act,,
which, had it not miscarried, would
have undoubtedly resulted in the loss
of several lives.
ROSE IS QUESTIONED.
Fire Marshal Towe arrived on the
scene soon after the discovery of the
blaze and at once proceeded to make
a rigid investigation. â¢ He found that
the inside of the lock on the front
door of the stone-had been unscrewed,
as if with the intention of misleading
the officers into the belief that the
fire was the work of burglar3. The
firemen think . that the tire^, was set
early in>Â»the evening and. that.^he in
cendiaries returned later to see why
it had not gained headway. , At this
time they took the lock from the door
to mislead the officers.
An investigation showed that the
fire was the carefully planned work of
an incendiary. A large iron bar had
been placed against the door of the
basement leading to the street and
every opening was puttied up tight.
The odor of coal oil was strong on
everything. It was due to the seal
ing of the vents in the cellar that the
flames did not burn more rapidly and
consume the entire building, with its
sleeping occupants.
When the firemen arrived they
found the door leading into the cellar
from the street securely barred. The
front door of the store, which had
been locked when tried by the patrol
man, was found to be unlocked. En
trance was gained to ,the basement
through the store.- The firemen were
driven back by flame j^nd smoke when
they broke open the door. After three
quarters of an hour of hard work
Captain Welsh and his men succeeded
In putting out the blaze.- * .
STORE DOOR UNLOCKED.
At 1 o'clock Patrolman Cooney
tried the door of the store, according
to his custom, and found it securely
locked. An hour later the sleeping
inmates of the rooms over the gro
cery were awakened by two sharp ex
plosions. , Seibert ' rushed into the
street, saw the glar^ of the flames- in
the basement of the ; store and- noti
fied Engine Company No.. 7, across the
street. >
When the firemen of Engine 7 re
sponded to an'alarm abo'ut 2:20 yes
terday morning in the grocery of Rose
& Berkman at the corner of Sixteenth
street and Albion avenue they found
all of the'doors barred. There was a
strong odor of coal oil in the base
ment, where the blaze was, and every
door and window, in the place had
been securely sealed with putty. Sheet
tin had been nailed across the glass
windows and around the rims of these
sheets was a- mass of -putty. :
* Some one had made a vicious at
tempt to burn the building: As early
as 7 o'clock in the evening L. F. Sei
bert and wife, who live above the
store, smelled the odor of coal oil,
but thought nothing of it.
Garnett. who had passively listened
to the proceedings, was then taken
from the courtroom and delivered into
the custody of the Sheriff and later on
was removed to the County Jail.
Df. Bacigalupi, autopsy surgeon to
the Coroner, was then sworn, and he
testified to holding an autopsy on the
body of Major J. W. McClung.
The autopsy surgeon described the
course taken by the bullet fired by
Garnett into McClung's body and as
serted that the wound had caused
death.
"That is the case for the people,"
said District Attorney Byington. .
Attorney Alford informed the court
that the defense had no witnesses to
call.
Judge Fritz then held Garnett for
trial in the Superior Court without
bail.
Garnett was taken into the Police
Court yesterday and locked up in the
dock and. when his case was called,
he was allowed to take a seat beside
his attorney, W. H. Alford.
District Attorney Byington appeared
for the prosecution and Informed the
court that only one witness remained to
be called, as all the evidence had been
presented on the previous day.
Alexander Garnett was held for trial
in the Superior Court yesterday by
Police Judge Fritz on a charge of hav
ing willfully murdered Major J. W. Mc-
Clung. on the evening of November 25
last, at the Palace Hotel.

Wife Tell in Love With Husband "All
i Over
The wife of a well-known attorney
at law of Seward, Xebr., tells the tale
worth reading: "My husband was a
soldier in the Civil War and was, as he
called himself, 'an old coffee cooler'
and had always drank v*ry strong cof-
fee.
"About a year ago he complained of
a feeling of falntness every time after
climbing his office stairs and was also
troubled by terrible headaches that al-
most drove him wild.
"He gradually grew weaker and
weaker until his affliction culminated
in nervous collapse and for weeks he
seemed to be fading away from us in
spite of all our efforts.
"The physicians pronounced him
strong and well with .. no organic
trouble whatever, and there seemed to
be nothing the matter except the com-
plete giving out of his nervous system.
"The doctors decided that coffee was
at the bottom of all his trouble and
ordered Postum Cereal in its place. He
improved daily, since he <iuit coffee and'
began drinking Postum^ind now says he
feels better than he has felt for twenty
years; headaches are gone, no more
fainting spells and is gaining in .flesh
every dav. and he. seems so much
younger and heartier and happier than
he has for years that I have fallen in
love with him over again.
"Now for my brother's case; a few
years ago he had a peculiar trouble.
His tongue was swollen and sore at
the roots and covered underneath with
festers. .
"He. thought his affliction was of -a
cancerous nature, and his doctor was
or the same opinion. He could scarcely
eat anything, and became so poor and
xun down he was eirjiply a.^ nervous
wreck. He . consulted various phy-
sicians, but. none were able to diagnose
bis case or help him in the least. Â¦
"At last a doctor to whom he applied
paid he believed my brother was cof-
fee poisoned and advised him" to quit
ceffee and drink. Postum. He gave him
no medicine, but told him to give
Postum a fair trial and return to him
jn six weeks. My brother had used
Postum only about ten days when the
festers disappeared from his tongue,
and at the end of two # weeks the sore-
ness and swelling- were gone and he
began to pick up in flesh, and spirits.
"He has never touched coffee since,
but drinks Postum all the time, and
baa never had the slightest return of
the trouble. . . ' , .
"To look at my experience, is it any i
wonder I can write a' heartfelt testi- j
rhonial . for . Postum ?" . Name given Â¦ by
Postum Co.. Battle Creek, Mich.

AT NEW ORLEANS TRACK
XEW YORK, Dec. 8. â Regarding
their business to be quite as legitimate
as that of the bookmakers, the pool
room proprietors of this city have
formed a club to emulate the Metro
politan Turf Association, popularly
lchown as the "Bookmakers' Club.".
No attention will be given the social
side of clubdom, however, as the or
ganization's purpose, 'will be strictly
business. * The number of rooms in
thej'city: and .their location are to be'
regulated. A* fund wilk be created for
protection against raids ancl wire tap-'
ping. -Arrangements wiir be made, if
possible, whereby the club will take :
charge of the telegraphic V service of
its members and handle/ the money
paid out for it. An attempt will be
"made to persuade the telegraph com
pany against furnishing " race returns
to rooms not vouched for by the club.
\ One matter the new organization
has already settled. None of the mem
bers will post San Francisco races/
because they claim to have been bad
ly beaten many times . on them by
players who succeeded in getting re
sults first. â w " '

tracks. He will, rest up for a day or
two before accepting any mounts.
Bullman says J. Rarfsch will be here
this week, on his way to Bakersfleld,

be persuaded to take mounts, Jay,
who led all the riders in France last
season, would be quite an addition to
the jockey ranks.
A report was circulated about the

Important Decision for Bowlers
DAYTON, Ohio, Dec. 8. â A decision
of importance to bowlers and bowling
clubs intending to participate In the
national championship contest of the
American Bowling Congress at Cleve
land February 8 to 13; has been ren
dered by the executive committee. Un
der the Indianapolis plan of organiza
tion it was supposed that all entries
would have to be affiliated with one of
the local city associations. This, how
ever, is not the case. Any club or
bowler is eligible upon compliance
with the rules of the congress, but no
club is entitled to any voice in the
proceedings of the congress unloss af
filiated with one of tHe city associa
tions. >

EMPEROR WILLIAM EXPLAINS
POSTPONEMENT OF RACE
lie Wishes to Enter the Best Craft
That Can Be Constructed Within
the Empire.
NEW YORK, Dec. 8.â Baron von
Sternberg. who arrived to-day on the
Kaiser William IT,' said in speaking of
the health ,of the Emperor of Ger
many:
"He was in excellent health when I
left him and in good spirits too. 'He
speaks, however, in a low tone, so as
not to complicate his throat trouble/
Those who are in a position to know
all about him feel no concern whatever
over his condition."
The. Baron denied a report that he
was bringing a personal communica
tion from Emperor William to Presi
dent Roosevelt.
"I am charged, however." he said,
"with a communication from the Em
peror to the New York Yacht Club. It
relates to the proposed ocean yacht
race and explains why the postpone
ment from 1904 to 1905 was made. I
may say that the Emperor's reported
illness had nothing to do with this
change in dates. In this deep-sea con
test he wishes to enter the best craft
that can be constructed and to do that
he considered the time insufficient and
therefore has made known his wishes
that it be extended to 1905. During
that period he will invite plans from
every yacht designer within the em
pire." .

Democrats in a Small Town
of Virginia Forcibly Oppose
Registration by Colored Men
NORFOLK, Va.. Dec. 8.â Democrats
in the town of Berkeley to-day drove
County Treasurer Lyons from his of
fice, where. It is charged, he was regis
tering nesrro voters, and the mob then
herded the negroes in one section of
the town. The streets soon filled with
men armed with shotguns and a re
quest was made for a company of mili
tia from Norfolk, but the riot was sup
pressed without the use of force. Coun
ty Clerk Martin was assaulted
in the Berkeley police station
while sitting at a table with
a negro Councilman. He was
roughly handled, and County Treasurer
Lyons was knocked down the stairs of
the Martin building, in which the al
leged registering of negroes was taking
place.
The mob was composed of about 300
men, all' white and nearly all armed,
shotguns and repeating rifles being
plentiful, while revolvers and clubs
were also in evidence. Several shots
were fired in the street, but no one \va3
hurt.
The riot was caused by bitter politi
cal feeling, which rms existed between
the straight Democratic, element in
Norfolk County and the fusion element
controlled by Martin. It is charged by
the Democrats that the county officials
represented in the office of the Im
provement Board had assembled there
to collect the poll tax from negroes
sunfptitiously and that on the other
hand obstacles are placed In the way of
white Democrats qualifying to vote.
In the crowd was C. W. Rockefeller,
a cousin of the Standard Oil magnate,
and Rev. Herbert Scholgoz, a Christian
minister.

CHICAGO, Dec. 8.â Harry Forbes
and Abe Attell have been matched to
meet In a contest which will be billed
as "for the legitimate featherweight
boxing championship." They will
meet on the 17th inst. before the West
End Athletic Club of St. Louis and
will contest twenty rounds for a purse
of $1300.
Forbes and Attell 3Iatched.
Toby Irwin, has fought his last fight.
The North Beach bpy's jaw was broken
last night in his boxing bout with Billy
Otts at the Reliance Club, Oakland, ex
actly as the identical injury was In
flicted four months ago in the same
ring by Otts. Game to the core. Irwin
went five rounds after the fracture oc
curred in the second round, and was
up for the eighth round, but Refere-;
Eddie Smith with judgment and
good decision stopped the fight at that
point, naming Otts the winner.
To the credit of the victor be it said
he keenly felt his position, and during
the fast round of the fight begged
Toby to quit, as the North Beach box
er's condition was evident to Otts.
Young Corbett, . who was a spectator,
went into Ott's corner in the seventh
after noticing that Irwin was In trouble
and helped end the unequal contest.
After, announcing his decision. Ref
eree Smith said: "Irwin's jaw has
been broken and he does not and can
not go on with the fight. I have stopped
the contest because cf Irwin's condi
tion. It is not in line with good sport
that a man thu3 injured should be per
rritted to continue."
in WIN IS URGED ON.
Irwin's handlers were bent on forcing
him to star. In the fight. Even after
the seventh round closed he was almost
hauled into the center of the ring, al
though his injury was then manifestly
causing him much suffering. Referee
Smith was ready as soon as the gong"
sounded and after a word or two with
Irwin the referee ended the contest and
sent the men out of the ring. Otts left
his corner crying like a child, for. as
he said afterward, he did not want to
be put in the position of fighting an in
jured men.
Irwin was taken to his dressing room,
where Dr. George Relnle. the Reliance
Club physician, and Dr. Clarence Tiil
man of San Francisco examined and
dressed the fractured jaw. Ths break
was en the right side either a little
above or a little below the point where
the fracture occurred last August.
After he had been bandaged Irwin with
his friends departed for San Francisco.
Whether Irwin cou!d have won" to
night is purely speculative.' 1 He was a
7 to 10 favorite, but under the condi
tions no fair line could be. .drawn on
the fight. , <
SEVEN FAST ROUNDS: 1
It win was ready to fight and made a
good showing as far as he went. He
used his 'eft steadily, but did not
force the fighting. Toby is not an of
fensive fighter. His strong suit Is to
put in his dextrous left when his. man
comes to him, and he kept to that
method last night. For all of his broken
Jaw there were seven rounds of stiff
going. Otts stayed with his right and
used it to good advantage in straight
leads for the head. In view, however,
of the result, it is practically settled
that the followers of the game will
never see these men. come together
again. Irwin cannot expect to continue
in the fighting business.
"Spider" Kelly. Eddie Hanlon. Harry
Foley and Frank Rafael were behind
Irwin. The "Spider" was overanxious
to force his man to keep going. The
lanky, trainer was on his feet two
thirds of the time during the fighting
and in the rests kept urging Toby to
stay just another round. "You've got
him, Toby, if you'll only go in." said
the "Spider." and Toby gamely went In.
It was only a question after that second
round when he must quit. Behind Ott3
were Tim McGrath. Young McDonald
and Nobby Otts, with Young Corbett
later.
OTTS IS KNOCKED DOWN.
Toby did not show signs of injury or
weariness 1 in the second round, but in
the third, after Otts had done some
heavy right-hand work on Irwin's jaw,
the North Beach lad went to his corner
a bit shaky. The round was a hot one,
with Otts on the long end. Once Otts
went to the floor, but at the close had
Toby tired. In the fourth Otts landed
several stiff rights on the . jaw, but
Toby caught his man a terrific left to
the stomach that bothered Otts. In the
fifth the flgnting was strong, with Toby
a bit the better in a stiff rally. - In the
next round 'the two made a. hot ex
change. Ott using- his good right and
Toby putting in the lefts. Otts led of
tener and was the more aggressive
throughout. The seventh opened,. jvith
Toby apparently strong. He jumped In
with five punches before Otts. started,
but the men exchanged rights and lefts
to the head that 'did not help Irwin's
case. That was the end of it.
- Young McConnell of the Reliance
Club polished off Henry Lewis, the col
ored r^ngster, with a knockout blow on
the jaw In the third round of a sched
uled six-round event.
Jack Evans knocked out Jack'Egan
in the second round.
Whitney's English Stable Sold.
NEWMARKET, England, Dec. S.â
There was a good attendance. here to
day at the sale of William C. Whit
ney's . stable. The horses were sold
without reserve, with their engage
ments. Hands Down brought 3400
guineas and Mintagon ; went for 1450
guineas. Per Surprise* sold for 200
guineas.: Mr. Whitney v paid , 3000
guineas â¢. last â¢ year for Per : Surprise.
Another costly failure was Mintagon,
for which the owner paid 2100 guin
eas.
r Cossid sold for Â£420. Armora for
Â£175, Versatile for Â£250, Mary Belle
for Â£310 and Slipthrift for Â£520. A
dozen colts'and fillies were auctioned
at sums, ranging from Â£20 to Â£510,
a chestnut fllly.by Meddler bringingthe
last" named figure, while a bay flily
by Liza brought 500 guineas. Two
chestnut â¢,., fillies by v Velasquez : and
Ayreshire were withdrawn. The to
tal amount -realized was, 8520 guineas.
The fact that the bettors have seen
fat to make Johnson a 3 to 10 choice has
not had a depressing effect on him. He
has been boxing with Joe Millet and
Walter Marino at the former's gym
nasium, going from ten 'to fifteen
rounds each day without a rest. In
addition to this he has been on the road
.in the morning, usually reeling off
eight or ten miles. In boxing he is
unusually light on his feet for a man
weighing 220 pounds. He carries a
good punch in his left hand. How good
his right is no one out here knows, as
he has not used it in training. .
He is round barreled like George
Dixon and his flat muscles do not stand
out in bold relief as is usual with the
big men.
Johnson's decisive victory over the
muaSi touted McVey has placed him high
in the estimation of the men who tollow
boxing. His known cleverness makes
him a legitimate favorite over his slow
er opponent. The men will fight in a
10-foot ring, which will favor Johnson,
as he is a hard man to work into a
corner.
The special trains will solve the trans
portation problem, eppecially as the big
ftllous will be In the ring at 9 o'clock,
according to the manager. The fight is
not expected to go twenty rounds.
The managers of the men will meet
to-day to select a j-eferee. Jack Welch
seems the man most favored for the
place at the present time.
Sandy Ferguson, the Boston giant, is
training for his fight on Friday night
at Colma with Jack Johnson as though
his life depended on the outcome.
The board decided to stand by the
foul-strike rule. The committee on
rules will be instructed to vote against
any efforts en the. part of the commit
tee of the American League when the
two committees meet to make rules for
the players to rescind this section.
The board awarded the National
League pennant for the past season to
the Pittsburg club.
The committee on constitution was
instructed to make the necessary
changes in the constitution so that it
will conform with the new -national
agreement. A motion was adopted to
change the r.ame of the league from
the National League and American As
sociation of Baseball Clubs to the Na
tional League of Professional Baseball
Clubs.
NEW YORK, Dec. S.â The annual
winter meeting of the National Base

CAHPENTE2S FILE OBJECTION.
The Carpenters' Union has forwarded
the fol!owing communication to Repre
sentative Livernash at Washington:
PAN FRANCISCO. Dec. 4, 1903.
The United Brotherhood of Carpen
ters and Joiners will try to have a law
passed in Congress prohibiting the
War Department from using the en
listed soldier in the construction of its
buildings.
Some tim? aeo this body appealed to
the Secretary of War to withdraw
these so!diers and give the employment
to the regular mechanics of the Car
penters' Unicn. The appeal was mot
with a rebuff from the War
ment, which said it would continue to
use the soldier to aid in the construc
tion of buildings on Government res
ervations.
He also added that should any of
the members of the association not
abide by the decision of the meeting of
yesterday and open 'in ihe morning it
would have no effect on the situation.
Several of the restaurants on Market
street that have been closed have pre
pared to open this morning.
The chairman of the executive com :
mittee of the Waiters' Alliance, local
30, refused to 1 make any statement on
the situation. I
At a meeting of the Restaurant Keep
ers' Association held yesterday, it was
decided to keep closed to-day. The two
contending factions have had no con
ferences and neither one has made any
overtures for such a meeting. Mr.
Johnson, when asked regarding the
possibility of any aggressive measures
that might be adopted at the meeting
of the Provisions Trades Council last
night, said: "We are fully prepared to
meet them."
The trouble between the restaurant
keepers and the waiters is apparently
no nearer a solution than it was the
day of its inception. This is according
to the statement of Mr. Johnson, chair
man of the board of the executive com
mittee of the Restaurant Keepers' As
sociation of San Francisco. He asserts
that there is practically no change in
existing conditions between the asso
tion and the Waiters' . Alliance.
Oldt can give no reason for his wife's
action. . Thev , had always .lived nap-
.SEATTLE. Dec- .8. â Mrs. Oldt,. who
with her child jumped overboard from:
the steamship Queen, was the wife,
of Haxry E. Oldt of this city, editor,
and publisher of the Pacific Coast
Sportsman." The . news came as a
great shock to him, as he did not even
know of his wife's whereabouts.
Mrs. Oldt arose early last Saturday
morning, and taking her child left homo
before her husband was' awake. She
had proparcd breakfast for him and
left "some money that he had given her
the day before lying on thÂ«* dresser.
Oldt thought her departure unusual,
but did not worry until night, when shy
failed to return. Sunday morning he
reported her disappearance to the po
lice and telegrams were sent in all di
rections. Last night a report was re
ceived that a woman and cb.Ild answer
ing the discription* were In Portland and
Oldt was preparing to leave for that
city to-day when news came of their
disappearance from the Queen.
Cannot Account for Her Act.
The belongings of the woman were
turned over, yesterday, to the United
States Shipping Commissioner, to whom
Captain Cousins has made a fuil report
of the tragic reason for their owner's
absence.
Mrs. Oldt was a woman of about 30
years, tall and neatly dressed. Pas
sengers that noticed her recall the un
happy expression of her face, and those
that had noticed and tried to comfort
her learned that the woman was fret
ting over trouble with her husband,
who. she seemed to think, had neglect
ed her. The 4-year-f!d girl was # a
cheerful little creature and made
friends readily.
MYSTERY UNSOLVED.
The bridge officers recalled no un
usual sound, and the night watchman
cmld shed no light on the mystery.
Th<* ship was searched, passengers and
stewards were questioned again, but
beyond the fact that woman and child
had disappeared nothing was or prob
ably ever will be learned.
In the stateroom the woman's out
side garments were hanging, and on a
Relic* etood two little shoes, belonging
to the baby. A purse .containing SI 25
Jay or: the bunk. That v.-as aJl. A
r^srch of the ciothes yielded neither a
snaik of identification nor a reason for
the woman's absence. Mother and
child had gcr.e, and all the result of
the closest cross-questioning of pas
pengers and crew was to fix the time
of the disappearance after leaving Vic
toria and before the early hours of Sun
day morning. ,
Fcngcrs, better of their seasickness,
brjran jo inquire for the mother with
the pretty little girl. The matter was
reported to Captain Cousins, who at
onrc rrrcide an investigation.
until Monday. The fact that her berth
had been unoccupied Sunday night
f.rst attracted attention. Then pas-
She returned to the steamship and
partook of luncheon served in the sa
loon after the Queen had started on
her way. Mother and baby retired for
the night to their stateroom, which
was on the upper deck, its door open
ing on the rail-guarded promenade.
The bedroom steward says that her bed
had been occupied. There was nobody
la the room when she went there Sun
day morning, but he thought nothing
of it and made no report.
The Queen carried many passengers,
most of whom were seasick, and, in
the confusinn, the absence of the
woman and child passed unnoticed
Mrs. Oldt joined the Queen at Seattle,
taking passage for herself and daugh
ter to this pert. The steamship reached
Victoria late Saturday afternoon and,
in company with most of the other pas
sengers, Mrs. Oldt spent a few hours
ashore, wandering: with her little girl
along the streets of the quaint little
British Columbian city.
IIETIUXS TO SHIP.
Where or when the tragedy was en
acted none can tell. Alone ' among
strangers, she kept her own counsel,
choosing her time sagely and executing
hÂ«r design silently and with grim suc
cess.
Mr*. Harry E. Oidt of Seattle, who
left the northern port last Saturday as
_ passenger on the steamship Queen,
disappeared with her 4-year-old
daughter during the dark hours be
tween Saturday and Sunday. That she
vent overboard there remains no doubt
and that her going was deliberate all
the evidence obtainable attests. She
leaves a husband in Seattle who de
clines to discuss the domestic infelicities
to which the unhappy woman referred
In the brief communion she held with
some of her fellow passengers. Wher
ever lay the fault, the burden was
greater than the young mother's
strength, and with arms clasping her
baby, she sought refuge and rest be
neath the dark water?.

on the plea of insanity. He did his ut
most to get the different witnesses be
fore the court to testify that they had
on different occasions noted. traces of
insanity In the prisoner. None of them,
however, would admit . that they had
ever noticed the 'slightest indication of
his being of unsound mind. Upon this
they all agreed. The room was then
cleared of ail but the membecs of the
court, who took but a few minutes to
reach their verdict.
Surgeon Edger -told the court in a
brief manner of the cowardly attack
made upon him, and how the prisoner
had stealthily entered, his office when
his back was turned, and- how his at
tention had been drawn to the pris

how' he leaped from his seat and grap

TORONTO, Ont.. Dec. 8. â Surveyors
of the projected Grand -Trunk Pacific
Railroad â¢> conflrm the report that the
two islands, Sitklan and Kannaghunut,
awarded to the United States by the
Alaskan boundary tribunal, are' twenty
miles from Port Simpson, instead of
two, and do not, therefore, command
the new Pacific port. The error in the
distance is said to have been traced to
a mistake in printing, the words
"twenty ar.d thirty miles" having been
copied "two and- three miles."

BESLIX, Dec. 8.â It became known
to-day that the -leading female dancer
at the Metropolie Theater, Fraulein
Freida Boelke, v;as murdered, at a ho
tle' in Cologne December 2 by Ferdi
nand Tessier, a manufacturer of ma
chinery at Vichy, France, who. had
several times been a Nationalist can
didate for member, of the. Chamber of
Deputies. They were engaged to be
married and had dined together at the
hotel and quarreled in a private sit
ting-room because the woman had
looked too frequently, as. Tessier
thought,- at another man in' the din
ing-room. He first tried to chloro
form the dancer, but she was a strong
woman and pushed him off... Tessier
then took a hatchet, which he had
concealed about him, and struck the
woman . once ineffectually. He then
stabbed her. fafally three times with
a dagger. The hotel people heard the
struggle : and . rushed to the spot,
whereupon Tessier, with his back to
the door, shot and killed himself.
Upon Tessie.r's^body were found a
variety of weapons, several sorts of
poison and Crosses and amulets 'from
Lourdes. Though the tragedy oc
curred - December 2/ through the in
fluence of Tessier's family, the facts
were not published until, the dancer
was buried here yesterday.

William A. Wescott/ a mariner, with
some local fame a3 a sea lawyer, and
who was recently jettisoned from Har
bor 15 of the Masters' and Pilots' As
sociation, insisted on Monday night
upon attending the meeting of that or
ganization. Although overboard and
drifting astern as far as Harbor 15 is
concerned Wescott by the aid of an
injunction is legally suspended between
air and water and according to his
own ideas a member in good standing
of the association that made him walk
the plank. An election of officers was
to have been held 'Monday evening.
Wescott put in an appearance. He
was asked to withdraw. He declined
and talked back, when the Harbor
members who had voted him from the
family criticized his action. Police
Sergeant Cook, who was called in to
eject Wescott, declined to do so, saying
that the trouble was of a private na
ture, the rough house in a private place
and the. whole affair outside the juris
diction of a public peace officer. The
sergeant resumed . his rounds, Wescott
his seat. The meeting broke up in dis
order and the election was not held.

The Mayfield was 258 days coming
from Hamburg and when she reached
here was in bad shape, having been in
some hard battles with the elements.
During her stay in port she has spent
a considerable time at the Risdon Iron
Worfts, where all damage was repaired
and the vessel thoroughly overhauled.
The Mayfield has wearied of waiting
after a much briefer spell than a num
ber of other Bri^sh ships have taken.
The Cawdor arrived here February 27,
1902, and is still resting and rusting on
a mud bed near Martinez. The Sil
berhorn, which arrived a month before
the Cawdor, has become one of the
permanent parts of the Sausalito land
scape, and from present prospects
these two vessels and a large fleet of
others flying the British flag must
either sail away in ballast in search of
business elsewhere or reconcile them
selves to many moj-e months of waiting
before charters at paying figures will
be available.
The British ship Mayfleld, whicn
cleared yesterday for Sydney, whither
she goes in ballast, arrived here from
Hamburg on February 24 of this year,
nearly nine months ago. In spite of her
long and patient wait she is leaving
without a charter, going in ballast to
the Australian port in the hope j of
there- finding business better than she
and a big fleet of her sisters have found
it here.

UNITED STATES GUNBOAT PETREL, ONE OF THE FEW REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PACIFIC SQUADRON
NOW IN THESE WATERS. WHICH SAILED FROM THIS PORT YESTERDAY ON A CRUISE ALONG
THE NORTHERN COAST.
President Pippy last night asked the
members of the league to take into
consideration a proposition to lease
the Quarters now occupied by the Pa
cific Union Club. He said the lease
could be had for 51400 a month. The
plan which he commended was the
renting of the main floor of the club
and subletting the two stories above.
An entrance from Stockton street to
the upper stores might be provided
and thus the Leaguo^ould obtain ex
clusive use of the Post-street entrance.
It was admitted that the present in
come of the Union League would not
Justify the payment of 51400 a month
for rent. The fact was also cited
that large sums of money would be re
quired to furnish and maintain the
proposed new quarters. Colonel Pippy
said that the hope which he had once
entertained, that the Bohemian Club
would move, had now vanished. The
Pacific Union location was the only de-
Eirabie place in sight- He asked the
members to inspect the premises and
submit their views to the directors.
NEW QUARTERS DESIRED.
Colonel Pippy's supporters assert
that he is entitled to the honor of the
presidency of the league during a
national campaign year, as".a reward
for the unexampled energy displayed
by him during his first and second
terms. The prestige and prosperity of
the institution have increased in a
wonderful degree, ard many of the
members accord to the president much
of the credit for the advancement.
It was the sense of the meeting last
night expressed in the general discus
ticn of the topic, that Federal and
State office holders should not be ex
cluded. -The resolution of instruction,
however, was withdrawn at the re
quest of several members. In the
comment on the subject, the remark
v.as made by one of iho speakers that
a club member holding a commission
frnm the President of the United
States or the Governor of California
should not be denied any right or priv
ilege pertaining to membership in the
club.
At a general meeting: of, the Union
Leagrue Club last evening, W. " M.
Macdonald, Joseph Simbnson, D. T.
Cole, Joseph S. Spear, William Morris
and Frank W. Marston were elected
as a nominating, committee. The
members comprising this committee
will nominate the regular ticket for
officers for the vcar 1904. It Is com
mon gossip in club circles that the
league intends to honor Colonel George
H. Pippy -with the presidency for a
third term. It seems to be the general
opinion - tffat the present regime
throughout will be renominated.
There was some discussion last night
on a resolution to Instruct the nomi
nating committee that there should bo
no disqualification for holding office
in the* league otfier than that ex
pressed in the by-laws. When infor
mation v.as asked concerning the true
inwardness of the proposed instruction
the fact was disclosed that the nomi
nating committee one year ago held
that Duncan E. McKinlay, who was
the^j first vice president of the club,
ought not to be nominated for presi
dent because ho was the holder of a
Federal office.

The Potato market was overstocked and
generally weak, as local, trading was of.- small
volume and confined chiefly to strictly fancy
offerings of Salinas Burbanks. Offerings of
Oregon Burbanks, ex-steamer, consisted
chiefly of low-grade, stack and the top quota
tion was shaded. Rivers continued to arrive
freely, but were firmly held, owing to ' the
high fcrlces at primary shipping points. No
fresh Sweets' came in and carrled-over stock
was steady, at the previously quoted rate.
Receipts -of Onions were Uflit. but the market
was liberally supplied and continued weak at
the recently . reduced quotations. ;
Many of the leading restaurants of the city
were still closed . owing to labor troubles, and
the demand from that quarter was still light,
hut an receipts from all sections were small,
there- was no great decline In values. The
top quotations . were easily obtained for the
best offerings of I'eas and Beans, but carried
over jtnd Inferior quality stock, which con
stituted the bulk of mipplies, continued weak
at. unsteady, rate*. ..Tomatoes were the weak
est as well' as the most .plentiful description,
and carried over stock from "errors the bay

minimum temperature of 2S degrees wae re
corded in Hanta Maria on :he Mh. High winds
In Southern California Injured orchards to
nrv.' extent, and drying winds in that and
some other sections absorbed much of the
moisture in the soil, rendering Irrigation im

NEW YORK. Dee. S. â The- bull movement In '
ctocks continued !n force during the eerly
Btagrs of to-day's stock market;' but the pre
cipitate course of the advance overran the mar
ket and a reaction followed, which carried
the average level of prices below last night.
The closing was easy and without recovery-
There was no news of the day whose Influence
could be perceived in the mcrket. The mo
mentum of the previous advance and the ac
cretion natural to any speculative movement
after a given amount of progress seemed the
principal elements of the strength. During the
bulge of the morning there was more appear
ance of animation and variety In the dealings
than at any" time heretofore. Stocks of all
rlaspes were transferred in enormous blocks
and at rapidly rising prices. "Tills great ac
tivity caused skepticism about the market and
induced professional traders, watchful for signs
of a turn, to put out short lines. When the
market paused after thÂ» first rearMon and
then started upward again the ilemand from
the?Â» uncovered shorts helprd the new ad
vanc*. From the outset enormous sal** to
realize were manifest In Brooklyn Rapid Tran-'
sit, which was a conspicuous figure, In last
week's advance. Amalgamated 'Cappe'r fared
better, adding a point to yesterday's five-point
rise before It v. - as seriously affect^l by realiz
ing. The sympathetic effect in copper stocks
generally in home ar.d foreign securities mar
kets and a violent advance in raw copper in
LxSndon helped this stock. It dropped back
subsequently' 2% and closed at. a net loss of
114. with decided effect upon speculative senti
ment generally. The failure of UnlUd States
Ftcel preferred to hold Us 1 >i-point advance
v.-as another strong influence in the reaction.
Reports of difficulties made by employes over
proposed reductions In wages and rumors of
the closing of important mills jIfo affected
this stock. It became known this morning
that gold was taken in London yesterday for
account of Chicago and New Orleans to the
extent or three-quarter* . of a million dollars
an<l additional enKaxements were made to
day for $C<*>. Â«Â°0. The renewal rates for call
loans were generally marked down (his morn
ing. Sonn> unwary borrowers were apparently
In hope that still lower rate* wy.ild prevail.
I^ite in the day. when they attempted to sup
ply their n^ds and when the Â»c{Ive specula
tion had already made large inroads upon the
available money supply, the rate for call loans
â¢was bid up to 7 per cent with th* urcent de
mands of these belated borrowers. This Hurry
in call monÂ»y doubtless was a pi.t.-ntial In
fluence on the reaction In stocks. The optl
mUtic view of the burin*** and finances of
the country taken by the Secretary of the
Treasury was a cheering Influence. .The im
mediate future of the market is largely de
pendent upon the f-baracter and the iesources
of those who bought, stocks to-day in the
tremendous outpouring to take profits on tha
pi-eviovs rise.
Business In bonds was principally !n specu
lative Issues. In which the price movement
was irregular. Total sales, M.M,V<M.
United States bonds were unchanged on the
lart call.

Andrea Sbarboro, president of the
Manufacturers' and Producers' Asso
ciation of California, is conferring
with C. F. Marlette of . the United
"States Department of Agriculture rela
tive to the establishment of a colony
of silk workers on. the property of the
Swiss-Italian Colony at Asti, Sonoma
County, for the purpose of engaging in
the production of silk in California on
a large scale. Mr. Marletto has re
cently been investigating the possibili
ties of silk culture in San Diego
County.
Mr. Marlette says he has been as
sured by two prominent men that they
will help to get the nucleus of the
industry together. One of these is A.
Sbarboro, who has said that the-suc
cess of the Asti colony Would enable
him to get all the capital that is need
ed for the silk-growing proposition.
Mr. Marlette 'says also that he has
great faith in the success of the trial.
It would not be necessary to have the
silk workers engaged all the time. at
Asti in the. silk industry. ' The silk
and grape seasons are different. The
Secretary of Agriculture and also Dr.
Howard of the department are inter
ested in the matter. .
.Jlr. Marlette will see whether the
officers of immigration will oppose the
bringing in of a small colony of silk
workers from Northern Italy. Only a
few months in the year is devoted to
silk culture. -Women, children and
other laborers. are engaged in the in
dustry in Italy. -The starting point is
to get the skilled labor from there, so
Mr. Marlette says, to give the new in
dustry a fair start. , '
Labor Can Be Obtained.

Interlocutory decrees of divorce for
cruelty were granted to John H. Paton
from Josephine W. Paton, Mary E.
Robinson from William Robinson and
Frank P. Mussio from Mamie Mussio.
The Mussios were married less than
six months ago.
Suits for divorce were filed by Millie
Randhahn against Richard Randhahn
for cruelty, and Isabella Williams
against Richard Williams for deser
tion. Emolyne Cordelia Halliday, who
was married to John D. Halliday at
Redding in 1S99, is seeking a divorce
on the ground 'of desertion, charging
that Halliday left her in July, 1900.
Judge Seawell granted Charles Rey
nolds a divorce from Mary E. Reynolds
on the ground of technical desertion.
They also, like the Cowells, lived' jn the
same house, but not as husband and
wife. According to the testimony, the
fault lay with Mrs. Reynolds. Rey
nolds and Adela Mulford furnished the
testimony, on which the decree was
granted. They both refusedt,t6 take an
oath, telling the court they preferred to
affirm. The" Reynoldses were married
twenty^three years ago in Indiana.
Queer indeed has been the method of
living adopted by Clara D. Cowell,
aged 60, and Henry C. B. Cowell, her
husband, aged 46. They brave been hus.
band and wife for eleven years. For
eight years they lived happily together
in Oakland and a little boy was born
to them. Then they moved to this city
and took up their residence in the
Western Addition, in a home erected
by Cowell. But, for some reason un
known to Mrs. Cowell, they did not
live together. Mrs. Cowell and her lit
tle boy. occupied the upper portion of
the house and the husband and father
lived in the lower portion. For three
years they lived thus, seeing each other
daily, but meeting as strangers. Mrs.
Cowell made repeated attempts at a.
reconciliation, but. Cowell repulsed all
her advances, and finally she deter
mined to sue for a divorce.
She filed the action charging her
husband : with desertion. He was
served with a summons, but refused to
answer, and yesterday, when the case
came up in Judge Graham's court, his
default was entered. Mrs. Cowell was
granted an interlocutory ''decree, her
evidence and the evidence of a neigh
bor proving that Cowell, though re
siding in the same house as his' wife,
was to her no more than a stranger.
The property rights of the couple were
settled by stipulation.
When the committee announced its
decision, E. P. E. Troy wanted to be
heard, \ but Chairman Braunh'art or
dered him to sit down. Finally Troy
was granted permission to speak and
asked the committee to insert a condi
tion that the company keep Point Lo
bos averse in repair.
Platt stated that the company will
agree to pave the space between the
rails and for two feet on either side
thereof, as required by the law in the
matter of granting street railroad fran
chises, and will incorporate a condition
to this effect in the orfer.
Owing to the opinion of the. City
Attorney that the board has no right
to grant a temporary permit for the
road's- operation, it "was agrreed to take
no action on that point. Braunhart
declared that nothing would be done in
the matter of the disposition of the
road before next June, when thp* bud
get is adopted, as. it might be deter
mined that the city operate the road
out of its current revenues. Supervisor
Loughery thought a franchise should
be granted to the highest bidder and
that action should be taken in that re
gard, as he was not in favor of al
lowing the road to run on sufferance
until next June. Brauiih3Â«*t thought
there was alarge element that would
oppose" the graritingof a franchise. It
was suggested that the $240,000 paid in
under, the specfal levy for schools and
a hospital, since declared illegal, could
be used to accuire the road, but there
was a diversity of opinion on that
point.
The Supervisors' Public Utilities Com
mittee, yesterday adopted a resolution
providing that the treasurer .of t,he
Geary-strot Railway Company pay to
the City Treasurer 5 per cent of the
gross receipts of the company, in ac
cordance'with the provisions of the
charter, beginning November 7, 1903,
and to continue during the temporary
operation of the road by thecompany. .
The resolution also provides that the
city shall waive none of its rights by
the acceptance of the percentage from
the company, which is specifically bar
red from asserting any rights to the
rails, subways or roadbed along the
route of thÂ»" road.
As a measure t/f precaution the reso
lution was referred to the City Attor
ney for his legal opinion as to whether
the acceptance of the money by the
Treasurer would jeopardize the rights
of the city in any particular.
President Platt stated that the direc
tors of the. company had voluntarily
submitted by resolution an offer to pay
5 per cent of the gross receipts pend
ing the sale of a franchise to the high
est bidder and would ask no affirmative
action on the part^of the Supervisors.
The committee objected to the clause
providing for the sale of the franchise,
as it did not know what disposition of
the road would be made, since it might
decide' to recommend the purchase of
the roacl by the city or might favor
that a "boulevard be made of Geary
street.
Frederick W. Dohrmann introduced a
resolution protesting against the
change of grade on Parnassus avenue,
now Under consideration by the Board
of Public Works. The proposed changes
of grade, it is claimed, will seriously af
fect the entrances to the Affiliated Col
leges and damage the property. Attor
ney Snook of the Board of Regents
was Instructed to file a protest with
the Board of Public Works before its
consideration of the subject to-day.
Dr. Eugene Waldemar Hilgard, pro
fessor of agriculture and director of
agricultural experiment stations for
the. university, has advised President
Wheeler that he will offer $125 yearly
for a graduate scholarship in memory
of his wife and son, to be known as
the "Hilgard Memorial Graduate Schol
arship." A vote of thanks was offered
by the Regents to Professor Hilgard for
his gift.
On recommendation of President
Wheeler, Dr. Alfred Emerson was ap
pointed lecturer in archaeology and
given the title of professor. Dr. Emer
son has had a distinguished career and
will be a valuable acquisition to the
university. .
Astronomer Hussey, now In Australia
with the Carnegie- Commission, was
granted further leave of absence for a
month and a half without pay.
Along the same lines, he asked the
regents to establish a hospital where
students, who were without means for
hiring nurses and medical attendance
could be taken care of properly. He
cited several instances to show that
the illness of students was not any
body's business in particular and they
were left to suffer alone in improper
surroundings when they should be
given the best attention procurable.
He also recommended a semi-annual
inspection, of lodging-houses occupied
by students, to the end that unsanitary
quarters might be wiped oft the lists of
the Y. M. C. A. and the university,
which measure he felt would suffice to
compel lodging-house keepers to main
tain their premises in sanitary, condi
tion. All of these recommendations
seemed to meet. with' the approval of
the regents present and -were referred
to the committee on grounds and build T
ings and the- finance commLttee with
full power to act. ' -Â»

WISHES A HOSPITAIj.
Clean towels are a crying need in the
University^ of California, according to
the recommendations urged by Presi
dent Wheeler before the regular meet
ing of the Board of Regents at the
Hopkins Art Institute yesterday.after
noon. 1 President Wheeler said Muit in
the gymnasiums of the university the
students supplied their own towels 'and
kept them rigorously in the line of
duty until they could be leaned against
a wall like a plank. Only on such a
showing are they sent to the laundry to
be mangled and made pliable again.
As a consequence of this procedure,
students are given to using towels be
longing to their, fellows that have not
attained a state of rigidity and nu
merous cases of skin disease inocula
tion have resulted. He recommended
that the towel supply in the baths of
the gymnasium be supervised by the
college authorities and that a fee of $3
a year becharged against all students
belonging to the gymnasiums to insure
a supply of clean towels.
President .Wheeler made several rec
ommendations in regard to the health
of the students. He wished that 'a reg
ular examination be made -by the col
lege bacteriologist of the three water
supplies of the institution to determine
whether or not the. water supply wa3
perfectly . pure. Further, - he recom
mended that students should have an
opportunity of subjecting themselves
to medical examination without charge
whenever they felt ill, in order to guard
against the introduction of Infectious
diseases among the students..
