BERLIN, -Dec. 10.â Chancellor .von
Bulow and Herr Bebel, the Socialist
leader, engaged in a lively debate in
the Reichstag to-day. The Monarchist,
who was dressed as for a drawlng
rooth. was amusing and cheerful, his
lucid sentences. falling easily on the un
derstanding. He disposed of a diffi
culty with airy word and gesture. The
republican, with a quality of voice
strancely stirring the emotions, , excited
his believers to enthusiasm and his op
ponents to, anger, one passionate sen
tence, following another to the climax.-;
Herr Bebel declared "Russia could
easilyseize Kiaochau whenever It suit
ed her, fancy, and therefore Germany
should exercise. her moral influence to
prevent . difficulty in East Asia.. .The
speaker, predicted that- there would be
a large increase in the military-esti
mate. ' , . . , *. . ;
Herr Bebel further asserted that the
naval enthusiasts, including those .in
the highest circles, were quietly en
gaged in a:, propaganda for . a new
squadron ; of . battleships. The speaker
also attacked the imperial financialsys
tem on the 'ground that it . imposed
undue burdens oh*lhe poor, saying, that
a larger income should.be derived from
the inheritance, taxes,, whichcould. eas
ily be made to yield JTo.OOO.'OOp addition T
al; but. he added,. the. classes owning
property, 4 whp mainly benefited by the
expansion policy, preferred an" increase
in direct-taxation. .
DEPLORES VAXDERBILT. FETE.
.-â¢ Herr-Bebel charged the Government'
with co-operating with Russia In sup
pressing political discontent: The Rus
sian police, he asserted, acted in Prus
sia as though at 'home. They received
every sort of- service from- the Prus
sian authorities; and dozens of Russian
secret police agents were .busy in Ber
lin: and other centers, spying. upon the
doings of Russian students or Russian
residents. This. Herr Bebel "declared,
was one exhibition of Caesarlsm, as
practiced in "Germany. .Others 'were
the receptions of -Cornelius Vanderbilt,"
unnecessary, gifts 'to roreign > nations
and spectacular* paradings of army
corps. All the^fuss and" glory, of mili
tary life in times, of. peace was time
wasted ; on ; frivolities, which could- far
better be spent -in actual drill and
study.', / 'Â¦' â¢Â¦ ,:â¢ . r r- "- : '' .-:-'
; Alluding again ; to ; the receptions of
.Vanderbilt- at Dantzic, ( Herr Bebel said :
': "What has he done. to deserve. &l\\ this
applause? These x things . give , the. im
pression, of "weakness, not : of strength."
BITTER; ATTACK UPOX Â¦*Â¦ ; RUSSIA:
â¢In the course of a 'attack
upon Russia, w-hich 'caused the sup
porters j of the i Ministry to 'shake - their
heads In" 'dismay,*': because"* such i. lan
guage about a neighboring power, had
iarely been" heard: Jii the German Par
liament,: Herr Bebl. said:,
Replying to Herr Bebei, Chancellor
von Bulow declared the Government
was firmly determined to continue the
developments of social legislation in
favor of the masses. In this matter
the Government required the co-opera
tion of the country. He would add that
nothing hindered progress in this direc
tion more than the habit of the Social
Democrats of connecting social ques
tions with anti-monarchical tendencies.
History, however, proved that mon
archies, made more rapid. progress so
cially .than republics, because a mon
arch .' occupied a . position of Independ
ence, .'above laws and parties. In no
republic had so much been done for the
workingman as in imperial Germany.
In Switzerland the Federal Council's
bills -embodying substantial . social re
forms,. like workingmen's insurance,
had been defeated, at: the polls on ref
erendum. -' ..- . "
.Turning to Herr .Bebel's criticisms
of the foreign policy of the Govern
ment, Count von Bulow pointed out
the : inconsistency of the Socialist lead
er in denouncing Germany's East Asi
atic policy as too fantastic and roman
tic, while on the other hand he cen
sured the Chancellor for his too pass
ive policy in Manchuria. Â¦
"If there is any place in the world."
said the Chancellor, "where we have
nothing to seek, It is Manchuria. If
Herr Bebel wants to head a new cru
salde to rescue the Manchurians I will
let him "proceed alone.' I shall stay
at home." ,
-Â¦ After discussing- at ' considerable
length the Socialist dreams of a so
cialized state, Count .von Bulow said:
"It would be the worst luck that
could happen to .you Socialists if you
came . suddenly into, power, for then
your 'inability, to organize productive
industries, your incapacity to con
duct ;a foreign policy, your complete
ignorance, would be revealed under
Bengal' fire."
"Russia is essentially a barbarous
state/against whose bestialities all the
European Governments have made no
protest."
The speaker then alluded _ to Kishe
riev, where, he said, the authorities
"stood by and watched' murders." Ho
asserted that a Russian "general had
driven thousands of Chinese into the
Amur River and said the arrest of a
Russian spy at. Sofia had resulted in
finding among his papers "document
ary proofs that Russia was privy to
the plan to assassinate King Alexander
months before the event occurred.'

"I had an Interview with General
MacArthur- yesterday.' and he referred
to" the strategic importance of the
Hawaiian Islands in the event of war,
but he did not mention any particular
nation. He said, in substance, that
Hawaii was the dominant strategic
feature of the Pacific. He also gave
gratifying support to our.effort* to im
prove the Hawaiian militia." ;. â¢
Governor Carter said to-day: "The
publication of Colonel Jones' report was
unauthorized by me, but it occurred
through a â¢ misunderstanding. At my
request. Colonel Jones wrote out " a
memorandum of his conversation with
General MacArthur, two days after It
took place, for the purpose of preserv
ing General MacArthur's views ' re
garding the National Guard. Coionel3
Soper and Jones and I had sought to
enlist .General MacArthur's aid In
getting back from the Federal Gov
ernment the military barracks site
near the Capitol, which was taken
during the Spanish War. It is now
wanted by. the Territory for an
armory. -â¢
Throughout all South American
countries, said MacArthur, the Ger
mans were advancing in commercial
power and prestige. The conclusion
seemed inevitable that the interests of
Germany in South America, where to
day there were large colonies number-
Ing hundreds of thousands, presaged
another testing and straining of the
Monroe doctrine, and In all probability
a contest of arms between that power
and the United States in the near fu
ture, in which event no one could now
forecast the attitude of England and
other European powers. Therefore, It
was the duty of the Federal Govern
ment to make itself as strong as pos
sible, so as to be able to care for itself
in any emergency.
VNo nation or number of nations will
be in a position to make an attack on
the Pacific Coast without first captur
ing these islands," said General Mac-
Arthur.
The theater of operations, said the
general, was changing gradually \into
the Pacific. The German people were
multiplying very rapidly and emi
grating in large numbers, the tide of
emigration being directed by the Ger
man Government toward South
America. The manufactured products
of the German empire overbalanced
their consumption, so that a market
had to be obtained for the surplus. The
known policy of the Emperor was to
acquire 'colonies which would provide
markets for such overproduction, and
places to which the tide of emigration
should be directed for strengthening
the fatherland.
Colonel Jories, in an interview, said
his report to Governor Carter was
based merely on a social conversation
with General MacArthur, and that he
had only intended reporting MacAr
thur's expressions of opinion Tsith a
view of impressing upon Governor Car
ter the need of strengthening the iso
lated islands from a military stand
point. He took no notes of his conver
sation with General MacArthur and his
report was written from memory some
time afterward. Colonel Jones said he
was very much surprised that his re
port to Governor Carter had been made
public.
Colonel Jones* report quotes General
MacArthur as having said that the
Pan-Germanic doctrine which -was be
ing spread throughout the world was
fostered and propagated by the impe
rial government in every possible way.
It was strong and getting stronger
wherever German people settled, even
among Germans who have been citizens
of the United States for years.
In connection therewith one fact
could not be overlooked, to wit: There
were few Germans in the American
army durfng the war with Spainâ so
few, indeed, that the presence of a Ger
man was noted as being a rare occur
rence.
HONOLULU, Dec. 10.â Considerable
interest has been evoked here by the
publication of a report made by Col
onel Jor.es of the Hawaiian militia to
Governor Carter. Colonel Jones. In
commenting on the strategic Â«lmport
ance of the Hawaiian Islands and the
need of strong defenses, quoted Major
General MacArthur, U. S. A., as pre
dicting war in the immediate future
between the United States and Ger
many and that the principal scene of
the flshtins would be on the Pacific
Ocean, with the Hawaiian Islands as
an objective point. General MacAr
thur, who is still in Honolulu, having
been here the past two weeks studying
the military situation of the islands,
said to-day that the report of Colonel
Jones did not correctly represent his
views in any particular and utterly
misrepresented them In some. He would
not discuss the matter further.

IN THE LEAD
Strange to say. none of the coaches
were derailed, but all were badly dam
aged. Not a whole pane of glass was
left in the entire side struck by the
car. The passengers were in a panic
and the cars were filled with flying
particles~of glass and splinters. None
of the passengers, however, were hurt.
BAKERSFIELD, Dec. 10.â The San
Francisco and Bakersfleld flier on the
Southern Pacific had a most remark-,
able escape from a disastrous wreck
when entering the Bakersfield yard at
6 o'clock thlsevening.
A monster oil car had been standing
on a sidinr so that the end projected
over the main line. "While running at
a speed of about forty miles an hour
the engine struck this car and dashed
by at full speed, the edge of the pro
jecting car tearing a long indent along
the entire side of the locomotive. The
projecting edge of the oil car then
struck the side of the first car of the
train and continued to dent the side
of everv car in the train..
The feeling between the army and
navy that generally* crops out when
ever there is International trouble re
quiring their joint service has appeared.
Though the navy insists that the situa
tion is well within its control, the army
takes the stand that . troops may. be
needed and they are therefore prepared.
Secretary Root has not taken up the
question for final decision, nor has the
President. . , It is , pointed out that a
fully, equipped over-sea military expe
dition to Panama' would 1 tend- to .make
the world believe that the United States
contemplated! permanent occupation,
there being, generally regarded, a wide
difference' between the landing/of "ma
rines in> country like Panama -and
the sending thither, of a carefully pre
pared military column. -
.The climate in Panama is extremely
bad at this, time of the year- and an-
; That other regiments will be added
to this force seems probable, inasmuch
as the Chesapeake and Ohio Rilroad
has been asked to submit an estimate
for the transportation of 5000 troops to
the Atlantic seaboard. The Southern
Railroad also has been asked to submit
estimates for the transportation of
troops.
In addition to the lack of confirma
tion of the reports of warlike move
ments in Colombia there is considerable
opposition to the sending of a military
expedition to Panama. The Navy De
partment is satisfied that it can handle
any emergency that will arise. At the
Navy Department it was announced to
day that the marine contingent on the
isthmus would be reinforced by COO men
now on the Prairie, orders having been
sent to "Admiral Barker, commanding
the North Atlantic squadron, now at
Guantanamo, to dispatch the Prairie
to the isthmus. She will leave to
morrow and will reach Colon by next
Monday. ,It is felt_ that, thus rein
forced, the marines now on the isthmus
will be fully competent to preserve or
der and prevent any invasion.
The purpose of any naval or military
movement will be. the same â to prevent
Colombia molesting, the sovereignty o"f
Panama.
ARMY AND NAVY DIFFER.
The troops designated for this service
are the . Sixteenth Infantry, Colonel B.
D. Price commanding, whicn is now at
Fort McPherson, Georgia,^ with the ex
ception of four" companies, which are
at Fort Slocum. New York; the Ninth
Infantry. Colonel James Ragen, which
is now divided between Fqrt Niagara
and Madison Barracks, New York, with
the exception of Company B, which is
in Peking, China, and the Twenty
eighth Battery of Mountain Artillery,
Captain O. I. Straub, which is now at
Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
RAILROAD ESTIMATES ASKED.
The general staff's plan for military
action in. this, direction . contemplates
the concentration of. at least three and
possibly five regiments on the Atlantic
seaboard, preferably' at New York,
where the* transport McClellan is now
ready for service and the Kilpatrick
will be ready on December 14.

Marquis Saionje, president of the up
per house, cays that the reply of the
lower house -was submitted without
proper notice.
After the adoption of the reply an in
terpellation was introduced in the
House of Representatives, declaring
that the delay in the settlement of the
negotiations -with Russia concerning
the Far East was a source of regret to
the nation and an elementof danger to
its peace 'and demanding a statement
of the progress of the negotiations.
The | situation is regarded as ex
tremely critical and as likely to in
volve the prorogation, if not, the disso
lution of Parliament. â¢
The' auction of the House is looked on
as doubly : significant because hitherto
the address in reply to the speech from
the throne has^only formally, expressed
thanks for the condescension of the
Emperor In personally . opening the
Diet. -
It is understood that this reply was
adopted at the instance of the presi
dent of the lower house and was a com
plete surprise to the Government and
its supporters, who had not time to op
pose the adoption. The reply was ap
proved amid a scene of great enthu
siasm. The members of the Govern
ment parties in the House have vainly
tried to persuade the president to re
consider the reply to the Emperor's
address.
SITUATION* IS CRITICAL.
"The diplomacy of the Cabinet is a.
failure, and we humbly appeal to your
Majesty to review the situation.
"Our solicitude for the progress of
the empire dictates this reply, which
represents the aspirations and expecta
tions ol the nation."
"The empire of Japan is now at
its zenith. Its position is one unpar
alleled in the last thousand years, The
members of the House of Representa
tives profoundly regret that at a
juncture so critical, involving the
fata of the nation, . the course pursued
by the Cabinet is ill-adapted to the
needs of the situation and inconsistent
with the enhancement of our national
influence. The policy of the Ministry
has been shown to be incompatible
with the progress of the empire, and
to be purely domestic and temporizing.
"Your Majesty has been gracious
enough personally to open the Diet and
to deliver a cordial message, which the
House ghas, received with great grati
tude.
"Â¦â¢Â¦ Soon after.the speech from the throne
was delivered in the upper house, the
House of Representatives met for the
purpose of conaffrrlrjs re
ply 'was almost Immediately- formu
lated and wa3 rushed-' through .the
House with unusual expedition. It is
as follows: Â¦
The brevity of the allusion by the
Emperor to the crisis in the Far East
caused much disappointment.
REPLY DENOUNCES CABIXET. '
"We have, furthermore, Instructed
the members of our Cabinet to formu
late a financial scheme and to intro
duce a budget with other bills.
"You are required to discharge your
duties and meet our wishes by careful
and harmonious discussion." :
TOKIO, Dec. 10. â The Emperor opened
the Diet to-day. The speech from the
throne, according to custom, was deliv
ered In the upper house and was as fol
lows:
"It gives us profound cause for re
joicing that the friendly, relations be
tween our empire and .other powers
ever continue to grow.
"As regards negotiations concerning
the important diplomatic, matter of
maintaining peace in the Orient and of
our rights, we have instructed our Min
isters abroad carefully to attend to
their duties.

Special Dispatch to The CaU,
DES MOINES, Iowa, Dec. 10. â
After completing a two nights' en
gagement in Foster's Opera-house last
night, Melbourne MacDowell, who is
starring in "The Captain of Navarre,"
found that his bank account was away
to the bad and he could not pay hotel
bills. After purchasing tickets to Oma
ha, where the company is ! booked for
the next performance; he lacked ex
actly $17. of sufficient means with
which to pay the hotel and he was
forced to give his note for the amount
in order to be able to proceed to
Omaha. â¢
Although local dramatic critics
lauded the play highly and united in
saying . MacDowell appeared to bet
ter advantage than in the Sardou plays
-f-r"Fedora". and La Tosca" â in which
he starred with Blanche Walsh during
former engagements here, less than
100 persons paid to see the second
night's performance, the first perform
ance having fared but little better.
Florence Stone, his leading lady, and
Gladys Delorme", next in rank, shared
the* honors of the caste with Mac-
Dowell. .
GENERAL WOOD URGED
BELLAIRS' RETENTION

WASHINGTON, Dec. 10.â The Sen

day recalled Colonel Charles S. Diehl,
assistant general manager of the As
sociated Press, who submitted letters
to verify dates concerning the request
of General Wood- for. the retention of
E. G. Bellairs as correspondent of the
Associated Press at Havana. â;_
Colonel Diehl said that Bellairs had
gone to China in July; Â¦Â¦ 1901. In Sep-.
tember the Associated Press . received
Information reflecting upon Bellairs
and he was. cabled to return to Amer

the office of the Associated Press' and
made a statement that in his judgment
the reports about "Bellairs were "un
founded. Bellairs was then instructed
to remain; but subsequently, when ad

was received, he was dismissed. .

SAYS WASHING THE BODY . .
IS AX INJURIOUS HABIT
CHICAGO, Dec. 10.â "When people
leave off bathing there will be little or
nothing for the doctors to do. Pneumo
nia, colds and a hundred, other .ilia re
sult from the foolish habit of washing
the body. To bathe is to be dirty, for
you thereby make a sewer of the skin.
Blood attracted by the akin gives up
products that should be left to seek a
natural outlet,, and soils the skin."
The foregoing declarations made by
Professor John Dill Robertson at. .the
annual meeting of the Chicago Eclectic
and Surgical Society at the Auditorium
has aroused the Interest of the mem
bers.
Professor Robertson asserted that the
theory that the closing of the pores
of . the skin would result in death is
false. He said that all physiologies
which made such an assertion were
wrong. The habit of taking "dry"
baths was also denounced. The rubbing
of a rough towel over the skin, accord
ing to Dr. Robertson, removed the nat
ural scales of the skin, or the "false
skin." This, he said, conduced to the
growth of bacteria upon the skin.
The doctor concluded with a touch
ing incident of a poor Eskimo brought
from Greenland to Boston who had
never been ill in his life. He was given
a bath, contracted pneumonia and died
in two days.
paring to dispose of his stock in the
corporation. His health has not been
of the best for some time and he has
decided to relinquish his local interests
with a view of relieving himself of all
business responsibilities during an ex
tended trip abroad, which he is now
planning. Who will succeed him tn the
North Shore road will not be '.deter
mined on until his resignation. has. been
acted on. ..."
Although the foregoing dispatch prac
tically confirms the frequent recent re
ports published in this city, President
Martin of the North Shore Railroad last
night again emphatically denied that
the road had been sold to the Santa Fe
Company. He recited the fact, as pub
lished in Th.e\Call some months ago,
that the Santa Fe . officials did have
an understanding with him relative to
the purchase of the road, bxit asserts
that the deal had never been carried
through. Martin expressed the opinion
that the North Shore Railroad had been
confounded with one of the northern
holdings of the Santa Fe, which Presi
dent Ripley refers to in. his statement
regarding the meeting.
' The local officials of the Santa Fe
when seen . also were, of the opinion
that the North Shore road had been
confounded with the San Francisco and
Northwestern Railway Company,
which was incorporated in the interest
of the Santa Fe's plan to secure rail
connections to Eureka. The officials
denied any knowledge of any deal
whereby the North Shore road has be
come the property of their company.
The Oakland and. East Side Railroad
Company was formed by the. Santa Fe
for the purpose of obtaining title to the
California and Nevada Railway and its
terminals and rights of way In Oakland
and Berkeley. The San Francisco and
Northw stern Railway Company was
incorporated about six months ago
with a view of absorbing the properties
known as the Eel River and Eureka
Railroad, the Callforn!a and Northern
Railway and the, Pacific Lumber Com
pany's line, which form the nucleus for
the Santa Fe Company's proposed new
coast line .between the bays of San
Francisco and Humboldt.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 10.â Chairman ;
Burrows of the Senate Committee on"
Privileges and Elections has- called! a
meeting of the committee for Saturday;
to consider whether any action shall"
be taken on the protests and petitions
for the expulsion of Senator Reed
Smoot of Utah. . That a thorcueh in
vestigation of the subject will be made
by the Senate Committee on Privileges'
and Elections now appears to be be
yond'doubt. By those who* are press
ing the investigation it Is said it will
be more comprehensive and searching
than any similar inquiry ever held.
It is believed by some, at least,, of
those who are opposing Senator. Smoot
that any effort made to prove he is a
polygamlst would result in" failure, and
while that point cannot be said- to have'
been abandoned absolutely, it is quite
certain the opposition will concentrate
its endeavors to prove that the position
he holds in the Mormon church is in
compatible with the oath of allegiance
he has taken to the United" State's. Â¦
- TOPEKA, Kan., Dec. 10.â The Rock

person or by proxy at the annual meet

Santa, Fe stockholders.
â¢ The purchase of the North Shore Line
in California was confirmed and Its fur

The practically unanimous re-election
of the four directors at the meeting to

two Rock Island men might be elected
to the board of directors.
President Rlpley in discussing the re

GLENS FALLS, N. Y., Dec. 10.â
Several mysteries were brought out
to-day In the first hearing of the- con
test over the will of "William Moore,
who left an estate of about $500,000.
There is in sight about $200,000 or more,
which, after a few bequests, Is di
vided in three equal proportions for
his wife, daughter and grandson.
Another clause in the will give3
whatever he has received or may here
after receive under the will of William
Van RenssGlaer to his grandson. No
one here knows who William Van
Rensselaer was or anything further
than what Moore's confidential attor
ney and executor, H.' P. King, testi
fied to-day.
King said that Moore intimated to
him that his estate was valued at
about $300,000, and that a woman who
resides in Los Angeles,' Cal., and who
occasionally stops at a hotel In Sara
toga, had a life interest in it. Moore
said he was bound by an oath not to
reveal any more, but that' a full ex
plantion would be found In his safety
deposit box in the vaults of the Glens
Falls National Bank. Thla vault has
not yet been opened, because of the
contest which Is now being made by
the grandson, who Is a minor. In case
the will is defeated , the grandson will
not fare so well, it is said, as he does
now, and it is a second mystery why
he makes a contest.
King testified that Moore toUJf him
that he (Moore) had contracted. to pay
a certain woman, whose name he did
not wish to mention in the will and
which was not disclosed in the testi
mony, five percentum of this estate.
By an agreement between Moore and
King this five percentum was to be
paid to the woman from the' commis
sion allowed the executor under the

TACOMA, Wash.. Dec. 10.â Because
a pretty Indian maiden living, on Peel
River in the McKenzie River country
wanted to learn a new song one of
the largest caravans of Alaskan In
dians ever organized journeyed 1000
miles from McKensie to Dawson last
month. Last summer this maiden
heard a prospector sing "In the Good
Old Summer Time." It interested her
very much. The prospector did not
know the song completely. Before he
left camp almost the entire Peel River
tribe was humming the tune as best
they could. â ...
Missionaries visit these Indians reg
ularly and Christmas festivities form
one of- their chief annual delights. The
Indian I girl whom the song first at
tracted proposed that a party of her
tribe should go to Dawson to learn
this and other songs. The. idea grew,
resulting in a caravan which was led
by W. N. Craigie, who reached Dawson
three weeks ago. While trying to make
a short cut Into Dawson he discovered
the new Seela pass, shortening the trail
from the McKenzie River to Dawson
by 300 miles.'
En . route through the Rockies the
caravan came upon and slaughtered a
herd of caribou and hauled the car
casges of fifty into Dawson on twenty
three large toboggans. The only wom
an to accompany the expedition was
the girl, who Immediately learned the'
words and tune of "In the Good Old
Summer Time" to her complete satis
faction. She and Craigie have started
back and will reach ' McKenzie .River
before Christmas. Later in the winter
another expedition will reach Dawsom
to trade. ' .'Â¦ '
The caribou meat brought by Crai
gie's caravan relieved Dawson's meat
shortage. It brought from 20 to 35 cents
per pound when auctioned in front of
the Northern Commercial Company's
store.

and it makes this comment upon his
work:
Th* first attempt to use oil on county roads
In the vicinity of Oakland. Cal., was made by
Supervisor Rowe of * Alameda County. -The
road In question was very steep and could not
bo watered readily without carrying the water
from the bottom to the top of the hill. The
road was very duety and much complaint had
been heard from the farmers that used It. A
contract was made with a firm to oil the road,
but. as the firm did not live up to U.a con
tract the Supervisor decided to do the work
himself. He secured a special sprinkler, which
was nttacned to an ordinary water cart. The
road Is to be sufficiently drained and oiled
again before the winter sets In. The oil was
applied cold and has entirely laid the dust,
but to secure & semi-bltumlnoufl roadway.' as
in Golden Gate Park, it is necesFary to put
the oil on hot. The farmers are satisfied with
the result because they can draw their hay
into town without Jiavlnx It covered with dust
and thus Ret more for their product.

The third visit was on Sunday, by
which time the love microbe had en
larged Into a chrysalis, sprouting
cupid-like wings. Dr. Howell found
that his attentions were very accept
able then, and when he had made bold
to propose he was accepted.
The wedding was fixed for the next
day. and, with little ado, the, young
people went to San Francisco and
were married in the parsonage
of the Rev. A. C. Bane, pastor
of the Howard-street Methodist
Church. Now they are residing
In a city hotel,-, awaiting the
time when the next China steamer will

to-day. "I, think my daughter must
have felt the same way. It runs in our
family to make up our minds quickly.
I was married when I had only known
my husband two days, and my other
two daughters have decided on quicker
notice than that even. Dr. Howell and
Bessie, I am sure, wilj be very happy
together, for I know they love each

EVENTS IN SOCIETY
The Rev. Dr. George C. Adams of the
First Congregational Church Joined
in the discussion. Before adjournment
it was decided to hold the next meet
ing of the association at Park Congre
gational Church.
After the election recess was taken
and the delegates and many of the con
gregation, more than 100 in all, accept
ed the hospitality of the ladies of Beth
.lehem Church and sat down to a re
past in the Sunday-school room. The
ladies who prepared the dinner and
waited on the guests were: Mrs. G.
Christie. Mrs. H. Tubb. Mrs. Neil Wal
ters. Mrs. R. Davis. Mrs. Siebert, Mrs.
A. Kromroy, Mrs. P. F. Peterson, Mrs.'
W. It. Walker, Mrs. C. Anderson, Mrs.
Fiddes, Mrs. Robinson. Mrs. Jameson,
Mrs. Mary Burbank, Mrs. W. P. An
derson, Mrs. J. A. Hollars, Miss Flor
ence Anderson, Miss Anna Peterson
and Miss Florence Stewart.
'The topics discussed later in the
evening were "Secret Prayer,',* by the
RÂ» v. James K. Harrison, and "Conse
cration," by the Rev. Carl Sinclair.
On the motion of the Rev. Dr. Pond
it was unanimously resolved as fol
lows: "That this association observes
with deep interest the movement to
ward a union of the three denomina
tions that have suddenly discovered
that they have almost" everything in
â¢common, the United Brethren, the
Methodist Protestants and the Congre
gationalists, and we will heartily re
joice in the accomplishment of this
union in any way which involves no
infringement of the liberties of the
churches."
The following were then elected to
serve on committees:
Home missionary committee, one
member for three yearsâ The Rev. Dr.
I. C. Meserve. Membership committee
of five members, for one yearâ Rev. Dr.
Meserve (chairman). Rev. J. Rowell,
Rev. T. J. Earl, Deacon W. W. Chase
and Deacon D. Gilbert Dexter.
GATHER AT FESTAL BOARD.
FAVOR CHURCH CXIOX.
The Rev. James K. Harrison, the
Rev. I. C. Meserve; D. D., the Rev. H.
A. Lurkenbock, the Rev. Mr. Earl and
other clergymen took a lively part in
the discussion, the trerd of feeling be
ing strongly toward the proposed union
of the church.
The Rev. Mr. Rader protected that
the church should never lose herself
as the church; she must not, he said,
become a theater nor a club, but must
rtand out with all her own attractive
personality. #
MUST "GO AFTER PEOPLE."
The Rev. Joseph Rowell followed the
Rev. Mr. Rader, and gave it as his
opinion that "they had to go after the
people."
The Rev. Dr. Pond as an example
showed the results of reaching those
who gathered in small number at the
mining camps for worship and with
influence of preaching how the congre
gations grew and the gospel was
spread.
Music and song in the church found
a powerful supporter in the Rev. Mr.
E. L. Walz of the Fourth Congrega
tional Church. He believed, he said, in
the blessed power of music to uplift
and bring people nearer ' to God.
The Rev. Mr. Wall supported the
musical pan in the service* of the
church, but the Rev. Mr. Rader main
tained the ground that, while it was
well to put themselves in an inviting
attitude, there should be no resort to
conspicuous attraction to the church.
The Rev. Dr. W. C. Day read a paper
on "The Proposed Union of Three De
nominations," paying that consolida
tion was th? spirit of the age. Dr.
Day considered that even where
marked differences occur it was a fact
that without any forelock toward this
adjustment the churches were drift
ing toward each other.
The Rev. Huber Burr was chosen
moderator and the business of the
meeting began.
After the meeting of membership
committees the Rev. William Rader
discussed "Going to Church" in a man
ner that was admitted to be strong and
jvell considered.
Among- the reasons, he said, -why the
people go to church might be men
tioned the historic Influence of the
church . itself. People, said Mr. Rader,
trent to church because of personal
need. He eaid also that the change in
belief which eliminated fear from the
ology had something to do with church
He considered that the
"new thought" had alienated many,
and that nearly one-half of every com
munity was influenced by Oriental
ideas, which he claimed controlled
church attendance.
By far the largest gathering that has
been known at the annual meetings of
the San Francisco Association of Con
gregational Churches and Ministers as
sembled yesterday at Bethlehem
Church, Twenty-fourth and Vermont
streets, the object being to elect certain
officers and hear discussions from the
clergy and reports from all the churches
of the Congregational denomination of
the city.
The plans of the Realty Syndicate in
regard to this property are not stated.
It is said that they want the water
rights, which are valuable. But it is
also intimated that the syndicate may
have plans for securing a franchise for
an electric road through .:ie new tun
nel, which, wpuld then make the. "Fish
Ranch" a valuable piece .of property.
But whatever the plans, this purchase
augurs well for the development of the
Contra Costa side of the hills, which
has so long been on a sidetrack.
The roadside saloon is now kept .by
a man named Moraga, a son of the
original Moraga who owned all of that
country and after whom Moraga Valley
was named.
The "Fish Ranch" is now nothing "but
a roadside house where the thirsty
teamsters that haul hay and-graln and
fruit through the new tunnel into Oak
land stop for a long glass of sharp
"steam." Occasionally a party on its
way to a "bulls head" at Walnut Creek
will stop at the old resort, but there
are no more fancy dinners, and where
once flowed champagne the humble
whisky of commerce is the best that
finds its way down the throats of trav
elers.
The "Fish Ranch" is a very famous
piece of property, and gives its name
to the main road between Oakland, La
fayette and Walnut Creek, which road
was at one time the stage road that
connected tide water on San Francisco
Bay and the interior of Contra Costa
County. The place was just exactly
what its name indicates, a "fish ranch."
There Is a live stream on the property.
It flows all the year round. This was
one of the best trout streams in the
Contra Costa hills, and was discovered
by sportsmen who made their head
quarters at the ranchhouse on the
banks of the creek and the road from
Oakland. When the trout were nearly
gone the owner bethought himself that
he could grow fish, and this he did.
The little stream was fitted with
ponds, fish ladders, hatcheries and all
of the necessary appliances for raising
fish of all kinds, and from that day the
property became the "Fish Ranch."
From that day the place also became
a resort where the wealthy people of
San Francisco drove for the purpose
of enjoying fancy fish dinners, and the
proprietor of the place made no small
amount of money by cultivating fine
fish and selling, them to the wealthy
persons who wanted to regale their
friends with a fancy dinner, and an
outing for a day or two. In the lively
days of San Francisco, when the Corn
stock was in full blast and fortunes
were made in a day and spent nearly
as quickly, the "Fish Ranch" thrived
and made a fortune itself.
But the elory of the place has long
since departed. The ponds have been
destroyed by the winter rains and have
not been repaired. The fish ladders are
broken ..nd in disuse and all the fish
that were not eaten have escaped down
the creek only to end their lives on
the hook of some angler. Even to this,
day there is occasionally caught in the
waters of the little stream a descend
ant of some of the fish of high degree
that escaped during those wild and
early days.
The famous "Fish Ranch," on the
Contra Costa side of the hills back of
Oakland, has passed into the hands of
the Realty Syndicate from the posses
sion of Mrs. J. H. Olive, the widow
of the original owner of the place. The
property contains about 500 acres and
the sale price is said to have been
$30,000.

. Although the proposed fowl ordinance
was sent from the Board of Health to
the City Trustees. Dr. Kate P. Van
Orden of the sanitary body, who has
been credited with promoting the meas-.
ure, denied to-day that the idea of such
an enactment .was original,, with her.
She says that -it wa^first .'suggested by
a City Trustee, who," for reasons best
known to himself, did not desire to lead
the crusade against, the chickens.
When the proposed ordinance comes
up for action at the next session of
the. City Trustees it is expected that
there' will be present a large number
of champions and opponents.
BATTLE IS IvOOKED FOR.
Another petitioner requests that the
ordinance be so amended that it will
prohibit the maintenance of rabbits
and pigs within the city limits. Still
another wants the restrictive law to
apply tp Thomas cats. This citizen,
who signs himself "Charles A. Towles,"
asks that steps be taken by the City
Trustees to exile from the island forever
all meowing felines of the male per
suasion.
A. H. Ward, capitalist, residing at
723 Paru street, is leading the fight for
the banishing of fowls from Alameda.
In explaining the reason for his op
position to chickens he informed the
City Trustees that the aroma arising
from a poultry yard near his home
soured the milk in his pantry, and also
the tempers of the members of his
household. Ward would have the keep
ing of poultry in the municipality made
a misdemeanor.
One correspondent, whose letter .will
be read at the next meeting of the mu
nicipal legislators, favors the running
of hen coops with wide open doors, and
asserts that if anything is to be closed
by ordinance it should be the saloons
and not the chicken-houses. The writer
holds that any one whose conscience
is at ease can sleep coundly with a
rooster chorus all around the neighbor
hood.
ALAMPDA, Dec. 10.âCommunica
tions â serfous, comic and otherwise â
addressed to the City Trustees rela
tive to the proposed fowl ordinance,
which if passed will practically pro
hibit the keeping within the limits of
the municipality of crowing roosters,
cackling hens, quacking -ducks, gob
bling turkeys, hissing geese and cooing
pigeons, are being received daily at the
office of the City Clerk. Not even the
agitation that attended the drafting of
the ordinances granting two local rail
road franchises to the Southern Pacific
Company stirred residents as has the
measure regulating feathered bipeds
that is now awaiting final action by
the City Trustees.

The daughter has now brought suit
to have the court make Mrs. Â¦ Barnes
make another deed.
It Is alleged that Mrs. Barnes gave
the property to her daughter, but put
the deed Into the hand3 of J. Meyer, a
real estate agent, with the understand
ing that, in case -of her death Meyer
should place the deedon record. One
day, after the mother's marriage esca
pade with Barnes, she went to see
Meyer and told him she would like to
see the deed, as she wished to make a
change in it, and when it was given
her she put it into the stove and de
stroyed it.
The trial of the suit of Mrs. Julia Z.
Hayes against her mother, "Mrs. Anna
B. Hughes-Barnes, who gained consid
erable notoriety by trying to reform a

of property at Twelfth and Jeffer3on

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Dec. 10. Â¦.
Through the medium of a printed card
the" sad news was conveyed to the fac
ulty members of the University of Cal
ifornia to-day that there Is not enough
money to cash the salary warrants for
the month of December. As thl3 la
the first time in fifteen years that the
university's treasury has been empty,
the information came as a shock, car
rying with it that aggravated feeling
that often goes with poverty. Unless
eome arrangement can be made with
some financial interest there will be a
total lack of Christmas presents in
Berkeley, and the glad cheer that usu
ally goes with the holidays will be en
tirely wanting.
The dearth in the treasury was caus
ed by the failure of the State officials
at Sacramento to send any money,
which means that at this late day
there will be none at all. As It takes
$33,000 a month to pay the professors
of the university, it Is easy to see that
there will be no one willing to adÂ«
vance that sum, even for a month.
President Wheeler and the entire
teaching staff are sufferers by thÂ«
omission.

NEW YORK, Dec. 10.â Passengers
who arrived in New York to-day on
the White Star liner Oceanic, ; which
reached the bar on Wednesday night
too late to dock, told stories pf great
seas that â¢ climbed aboard the big
steamship in .the first three days out
from Liverpool and of some of 1 the re
markable things they did.
One big wave reached into the smok
ing room on the second day out and
took a good-sized jackpot.' The poker
game was drowned out on Friday
night. It was at its most interesting
stage, with about $65 in the pot, when
there was a rush of water through the
open portholes. Several barrels of
brine were poured over the surprised
players and the flood washed a Jack
pot and the chips from the table. The
players bolted to escape another, wet
ting. Afterward they recovered some
of the cash and after getting, into dry
clothing they resumed the game.
Among those who came gn .the
Oceanic was Commander Booth-Tuck
er of th'.? Salvation Army, his daughter
and his secretary, Captain Wright.

pointed by the Council. Â¦Â¦-While.- his
plan met with some opposition from
those who were against the one-man
power, it found much favor. A motion
was made to indorse the plan, but a
sub-motion that it be referred 'to a

. Judge Cabaniss dismissed the case
"of. assault. against Gustav Marx of 3034
Fulton street, who had smashed the
.'cranium' -of . Thoma^ , .Hines * of 1807
â¢Hai^ht _ street with a heavy, kerosene
lainp,'WhHe that gentleman was a bid
den,guest of .the ..Marx, household one
flight last week.;,.
It was shown thai Marx and Hines
were old- friends when they met' on the
street and that, in 'the course of con
versation,. Hines Temarked that he had
$180 in his possession, and was rather
afraid to go home alone because of the
possibility of ' being waylaid and
robbed. Marx then' invited Hines jj to
spend the night at his house, and the
invitation was gratefully v acepted!
Before : 'retiring, Hines 'turned ' his
money over to Marx, with a. request
that It; be concealed where burglars
would be least likely to find it if they"
should mvade the'domicile, and Marx
decided that the safest '- depository
would be under the pillow of the Marx
Couch'.' So there it was placed, ; in "full
sight of and .with the entire approval
of Hines. : ; v
Some time during the night Mrs.
Marx; was' awakened by a. hand
groping under her pillow, and she
awoke her hflsband and, in affrighted
'Whisper, asked If the obtrusive hand
were .his. He wiispered a'^ negative
and at the. same, time grasped the
hand with one of his own, while; with
the" other he snatched " a . lamp from v a
table at the bedside, and with it eimed
at \thV place where he calculated 'the
head of the owner of the imprisoned
hand might be. His calculation, was
correct. The lamp crashed upon a
skull, and when a light was obtained
it shone' upon Hines,- weltering, as the
yellow-backed novels say, in \ his ! gore.
When Â¦ the â¢ customary restoratives
had resuscitated , Hines hs proceeded
to' have his host arrested for, assault,
and - incidentally 'accused him of
making away with a . portion ' of 'the
money intrusted to his keeping. 'â¢[/ In
court yesterday he could 1 not- clearly
remember what; prompted him."to_ in
vade the. sanctity of the Marx sleeping
place while all was dark and still,': and
the court dismissed the battery. charge
and treated \ the accusation of robbery
as lacking'* sufficient substantiation to
justify Judicial action, or even to war
rant police inquiry. .

Deep anxiety again prevailsrin the
uptown offices of the Southern. Pacific
Company over- a report, to the.,, effect
that just prior to his. departure, for the
north with President- Harriman Gen
eral Manager Kruttschnitt issued in
structions to the principals of the va
rious departments of the road to pre
pare for him a complete list of all em
ployes who are eligible for retirement
under the pension rules of the com
pany. These reports have already been
passed to Secretary Worthlngton and
are awaiting the return of the general
manager from Portland.
It was stated yesterday by one of the
prominent officials of the road that
the lists include very nearly 100 names
of. employes who have reached or
passed the ,age limit. The pension
board of the Southern Pacific has not
held a meeting for a number of months,
a fact which is attributed to the fre
quent and prolonged absences in the
East of General Manager Kruttschnitt.
While . recently in this city President
Harriman one day asked Kruttschnitt
how the pension system was working,
and received the reply from his general
manager that for reasons stated above
he had not had time to give it the at
tention it deserved.. Harriman sug
gested that the matter should not be
neglected any longer than possible, and
the following day the order went forth
to the various departments. It is ex
pected that the pension board will
meet in a few days and the threatened
lopping off of heads is what is now
worrying the faithful old .employes of;

that the boys .were intoxicated at the

Last week two people were robbed
on Haight street. One of them was the
Tvife of a policeman. The lady was

Flreet v.-hen thieves cut the chain that
held a cLatelaine bag while she was
holding it in her hand. A man well
known in fraternal circles lost a purse
containing $25 and eighteen fraternal'
buttons while riding: on a car.
Already property and coin to the
value of several thousand dollars has
been stolen, and there is the probabil
ity of a big clean-up during the holi
days. All the detectives have received
special instructions to keep Â¦ a sharp
lookout for thieves, and several sleuths
ha\-e received no other detail for many
days. Notwithstanding the vigilance
of the police complaints have been
made from all rnrts of the city. People
ha\-e bees robbed on nearly every car
line in. the city, and tho crowds at
Golden Gate Park and the beach have
Buffered severe losses. Last Sunday the.
captain cf detectives detailed six of his
men to the boacn, with orders to arrest
all known crooks, but despite these pre
cautions several thefts occurred.
Pickpockets, and sneak thiev?s who
operate on street cars, ferry-boats and
in crowded thoroughfares are claiming
the attention of the detective depart

last two weeks numerous crimes com

of the work leads the police to believe
that a gang of clever Eastern crooks
has infested the city.

ROME, Dec. 10.â One of the strangest
of crimes had a most dramatic solution
to-day. A young man named Beretta,
a millionaire of Milan ahd a famous
sportsman, was invited by the Cheva
lier Angelo Vecchio, an organizer of
sporting shows, to his villa outside of
Milan on the pretext that he wished to
have Beretta examine some old pict
ures.
Once there Beretta was seized and
bound and obliged, with a revolver
pointed at his head, to make a will
leaving his fortune to Vecchio, besides
writing a letter saying he had commit
ted suicide. Vecchio then left the villa
after instructing an accomplice to
drown Beretta the next day In a bath
and carry the body far away from the
villa so as to give Vecchio a chance to
prove an alibi.
But the heart of Vecchio's accomplice
softened rtnd he set Beretta at liberty,
and Vecchio, who read in the papers
tha,t "his plot had been discovered, dls
j appeared. The police thought he had
i gone to America. It was learned to
day tha.t. Vecchio had committed suicide
by shooting while driving in an open
carriage on the famous Monte Pinco
drive.
â¢He was conveyed, to the Emergency
Hospital, 'where he died a few minutes
later. The deceased had worked for
twenty-seven, years at the: Western
Sugar Refinery, but during the last
four months hadbeen unable to attend
to his work.' He was being treated by
Dr. Gallwey for nervous trouble and
became very despondent when recovery
didnot come rapidly. ' /Â¦Â¦ > - â¢.â
Browning was 46 years old and lived

*Browning. had been suffering from

' It was' then the court administered
to Senor Quiros the oath that pledges
him to abandon for thirty days a habit
of thirty years' standing.
When the Senora Qulros took the wit
ness stand ;. to give her testimony one
of the court attaches remarked that
shehad ;not come inUTcourt with clean
hands. His* Honor gallantly ignored
the objection in -its legal sense 'and
just as chivalrously declined to notice
the ample' material evidence to sub
stantiate Its literal phase.'
"If he could only be. compelled to
stop tippling," suggested the witness,
"I- think he would be a better husband
and son-in-law.'! - : â¢: . .
With his. right hand r.-iised 'as^h'igh
he could elevate it withyur remov
es; his feet from the floor. Juan B.
Qulros swore in adulterated Spanish
that for one month from the moment of
taking oath he would abstain from
tasting intoxicating liquid of any kind.
Then he was told by Judge Fritz, to
whom the pledge was made, that he
was dismissed from custody.
It was for persecuting his mother-in
law that Senbr Quiros found himself
participating in the procession of mis
demeanants that filed past' the bench
of Fritz. His wife was the complain
ing' witness- and -she testified that for
thirty years her spouse had been a/
devotee at the shrine of Bacchus, and
while under the influence of that jolly
god he made a specialty of disturbing
the tranquillity of his mother-in-law's
existence.
VAs there is'- radical conflict of what r
seems to be "reliable^ testimony.' in .thi& H
case," deereed the \ judge, "I â¢ will take
it under advisement till, to-morrow." - :
"Can't you dispose of 'it: ndvv^" In
quired the defendant. v al^wjng^his
glasses to drop from -hisrios 1 ?.^. \.
"Nay, "nay," replied the court; 'Â¦Â¦'Â¦'' v'=
Mr. Johnston gathered .up his law
books, adjusted his spectacles and sal
lied forth^ w>,' ;... Â¦.,:Â¦' \y Â¦
"I do," was the calm* resi>onse. :'Â¦Â¦ Â¦-Â¦
Then, turning to the bench, Mr.
Johnston declared he had be^n "abused
frightfully" by the officer. Having once
served as a magistrate himself, he said
-Mndeed, having been chairman of ?Â¦a
board of London/maststratesâ he would
ask if it were likely that .he would re
sist a policeman so" long as .that police
man acted within authority 1 l;No,
and again and again) ' ijo.f. :.Th<v fact *"ef
the matter, Â¦ as. related by Mr, Johnston,
was that. while indulging inva' 1 , pqst"
prandial" stroll' on'" Keamy> : street 'he
saw the crowd and-realizing' thatfit dlfl
not represent an. .organized 'movement
he started in to obtain the namÂ£s of^ its
leading spirits) with, a' view tu prose
cuting them in the ! event that the pro
prietors of the.- boycotted "" establish
ment should decide, to urosecute.
"Then this poljceman Teams along."
said Mr. Johnston, - "and - abused me
most detestably.', . I' didn't refuse to
move on, but I' did 'protest against be
ing unnecessarily abused." : -\ '-./. .
A witnes3 named Stevens corroborat
ed the policeman's story to the extent
of stating that when he was ordered
to "move on" Mr. Johnston "got on hia
dignity." The defendant hoisted to his
nose a pair of gold-rimmed glasses and
â¢asked the policeman if he, the defend
ant, had refused to respect the law as
represented by him, the policeman."
"Oh, you got on your dignity and
wouldn't move," replied thA. complain. ,â¢
xnt. Â»* â¢"â Â¦Â¦'
"Got on my dignity, eh?**You swear
* got on my dignity; eh ?f -. ) - ; ."
A hush fell upon the assemblage in
Judge Slogan's court when H. Digby
Johnston entered the railed inclosure
to pose in the dual capacity of accused
and attorney. His tout ensemble wa3
so widely at variance wiih the personal
make-up of the average Police Court
defendant or pleader that his stately
entree compelled admiration, as well as
curiosity. A tall, well-knit figure, cor
rectly coated, r trousered and booted,
with the upper portion of the frock coat
unbuttoned sufficiently to expose a sec
tion of faultlessly fitting vest and a
severe combination of snowy linen and
sable necktie; a face of typical British
roundness and ruddiness, flanked on
each side by a carefully combed gray
whisker of the style variously arid ir
reverently-classified as "Dundrearies,".
"mutton chops'," Â¦ "sideboards" and
"sluggers" â that was H. Dig-by John
ston, former London barriste'r, now
practicing lawyer and naturalized cit
izen of the United States, as he faced
the charge of obstructing a public
thoroughfare entered against him by
Policeman John Kramer.
The officer stated that on Wednesday
evening his attention was attracted by
a crowd surrounding the entrance to a
clothing store on Kearny street, be
tween Bush-and Sutter, and the. cause
of its being, he ascertained, was a boy
cott of the store by certain dissatisfied
employes and the efforts of them" and
numerous sympathizers to persuade the
general public from purchasing goods
therein. While the boycott itself did
not call for the policeman's interfer
ence, the fact that those operating it
were obstructing the sidewalk induced
him to order them to "move on," an
order which was obeyed, he said, by all
except the defendant, who was nb less
conspicuous in the throng than 'in the
court. When the witness. attempted to
enforce his command by .clutching Mr.
Johnston's arm, that gentleman said,
in haughty tone, "Unhand me. sir,"
and with equal hauteur demanded the
policeman'3 number, raised his cane as
if to strike, and also uttered the words,
"You dirty dog." Whereupon he was
arrested and charged as hereinbefore
noted.

J. F. Lawless, â¢ general manager of
the San Francisco Gas and Electric
Company, agreed yesterday before the
Supervisors* Light Committee to in
stall twenty lamps in Oceanside, for
merly known as "Carville," provided
no deduction was made in the bills
of the company during .December for
"outage" of lights. Gas Inspector
Tupper reported that he had deducted
S 336 45 for October and $409 32 for
November for lights that were not
lighted during those months, and the
claims were referred to the Board of
Works. Lawless said the outage was
caused by the cutting of wires for
house moving, which was not the
company's fault.
Lawless said the company would
place the twenty lights in Oceanside
immediately and would not Insist upon
the payment of the bills against the
city for power for the operation of
the elevators in the City Hall and Hall
of Justice, which, he claims, was not
included in the contract. The bills
for the year ending December 21 will
aggregate $3000 for this purpose.

The police have five desperate char
acters in the tanks at the Central po-*
lice station who are wanted for a num
ber of burglaries committed in the city
within the past month. They are a por
tion of a gang of eight who have been
successfully looting stores and resi
dences, particularly in the North Beach
and Western Addition portions of. the
city. Detectives are searching for the
other three, and the entire gang will be
booked on several charges as soon as
fhey are landed behind the bars.
.Four of the men narrowly escaped
arrest about two weeks ago when they
were robbing Millar's butcher shop, at
Mason and Union streets. A police of
ficer was on the way to corral them
when a sergeant, not knowing what
was going on, blew his police whistle
and frightened them away: Detectives
Stephen Bunner and John Freel were
detailed on the case, and after an in
vestigation learned the identity of the
thieves. One of the men under arrest
is a negro named Cotton. There are
also three. Italiansâ Satori, Barbetti and
De Martini. The evidence against the
gang is strong and the officers are posi
tive of convictions.
Detectives Tom Ryan, Ed O'Dea and
George Mulcahy are scouring the city
for burglars, and acting under the or
ders of their chief are arresting a num
ber of ex-convicts who make their
headquarters on Third street. They ar
rested Arthur Jackson and placed his
name on the detinue book pending In
vestigation. Information was given the
police that Jackson is a bad character
and that he j has also been implicated
in many of the recent crimes. He- is
being ker>t in close confinement and his
record is being looked up.
Each night more burglaries are re
ported, and many of them are in the
downtown section of the city. Early
yesterday morning the saloon of A.
Otersen, at 35 Post street, was entered
by burglars and $50 secured from the
cash register. The thieves used a "jim
my" on the front door and made their
escape.

Detective McMahon says that Hor
Get ar.'l Low Toy belonged to the Wy
tong. which is favorably disposed to
ward the Sen Suey Ying tong, and as
the Sen Suey. Ying tong men are in
hiding the Hop Sing men have turned
their attention to the killing of the
Wy ton_ men.
In the same building are the head
quarters of the Hop Sing tone, which
was riddled with bullets by Sen Suey
Ying men on Monday morning. It was
evident that the room had recently
been occupied, as there were fresh but
ter and bread on a table. It is thought
they laid in wait for Low Toy and shot
him down when he appeared at his
door.
The Hop Sins men % who have been
in hiding since the shooting on Satur
day night, when one of their number
and a member of the Sen Suey Ying
tong were wounded, are again making
their appearance on the streets of
Chinatown, thirsting for blood. They
tried to kill one man and succeeded in
killing another.
About noon yesterday Hor Get, who
is employed in Quor.g On's tailor shop
at 922 Stockton street, was Ironing a
pair of trousers, when Ting Jew, alias
Jew To~. a member of the. Hop Sing
tong, appeared in the doorway and,
pulling a big revolver out of his pock
et, fired a shot at Hor Get. The bullet
missed its mark and Ting Jew was in
the act .of firing another shot, when
he saw some of the Chinatown .squad
running toward him. They had been
but half a block away.
Ting Jew ran to Washington street
and threw his revolver into a doorway,
where it was picked up by one of the
squad. He continued his Might to
Spofford alley, where he was overtaken
by two members of the sauad, Owens
and Earle. and placed under arrest.
He was taken back to" 922 Stockton
street end was identified by Hor Get
as the man who fired the shot at him.
He was then taken to the City Prison
and booked on a charge of assault with
intent to commit murder. He was ar
rested on Tuesday night, along with
Ah Wing, by Detective McMahon and
Sergeant Sylvester in Spofford alley
for carryins concealed .weapons and
was released on $100 cash bail.
Less than three hours later Low Toy.
a fisherman, who lived in a private
Josshouse at 737 Jackson street, was
shot dead, presumably by a Hop Sing
man. He had been coming out of his
room smoking a pipe, when two bullets
were fired ir.to his neck from behind.
They killed him instantly. Detective
McMahon, Sergeant Sylvester and some
members of the Chinatown squad were
standing on the corner of Stockton
street, and a Chinese shouted to them
that two shots had been fired in the
building at 737 Jackson street and they
ran to the scene. They found Low Toy
lying dead on the floor, face downward,
with two bullet holes in the back of
his neck. A thorough search was made
of tlie building, but no trace of the mur
derer could be found.

"It was just after I had opened the
office. A young girl, with raven black
hair, a beautiful pair of eyes and a
complexion and figure that would make
the e.ves of an artist glisten with ap
preciation, came in and, walking up to
the desk, blushingly ; asked me if a
woman could take out a license. I told
her yes: that all the law required was
one of the parties to swear to the truth.
I got a blank ready and asked her the
name of her spouse-to-be, his age and
whether he had ever been married be
fore. She answered my questions will
ingly and clearly enough, and seemed
relieved when she told me that he was
over 21.
"I then asked her own name. She
gave it to me, and said she had never
been married before. 'And your age?'
2 'asked. She hesitated a moment and

The Technical Review nf Berlin
states that a plant has recently been
found in South America which contain.*
a considerable quantity of saccharine
matter, is not fermentable, and pos
sesses an unusually strong saccharin*
taste. The plant is herbaceous, and is
from eight to twelve inches high. Thi
chemist Beftoni considers this plant as
of highly important value from an in
dustrial standpoint on account of its
natural sugar properties, which are of
a high percentage. Its scientific name
is Eupatorium rebandium. According .
to experiments made by the discoverer,
the director of the Agricultural Instl-'
tute at Asuncion, this interesting plant
is said to yield a sugar which ia from
twenty to thirty times as sweet as or
dinary cane or beet sugar.
New Saccharine Plant.
The general; public will hope that' Amador County
may make the fine showing . at St. Louis of which it. is
capable. Says the Ledger: "There is no:territory of /equal
extent in California 'that has greater or "more extended
resources of wealth than the favored strip of land com- ?
prisirig Amador Countjy With other foothill counties
it is really the paradise of California. Perhaps nature
has been so beneficent in bestowing its favors that this
very fact has tended to create the -spirit of contentment
with things as they are." Mining is not the only re
source of Amador by : any means. . ;Â¦ ;
AMID the general bustle of preparation for adver
tising the resources of California at the great
Louisiana Purchase Exposition, to be held in
St. Louis in 1904, some discordant notes may be heard.
The Amador .Ledger, for instance, complains that the
people of Amador County are making very little exer
tion to have the wealth of that part of the mother lode
country exploited. Every one knows that there is much
gold, good climate and rich soil in Amador County.
Taking a scries of years together, its mineral output has
represented a value of many millions of dollars. Yet
the Amador Ledger says that "outside of the efforts put
forth by the State Mineralogist, L. E. Aubury, there
seems to be very little doing in the way of collecting
exhibits of Amador County's resources for display at
the St. Louis exhibition next year."'"
Supplying particulars relating to this inaction of the
people, the Ledger asserts that "outside of an effort to
collect a few ancient mining contrivances, representing
the primitive'methods of mining in the early days, there
is scarcely any interest manifested in this direction. We
indulge the hope that, whatever be the cause of the list
lcssncss hitherto shown, some active measures will be
taken at once -to secure a well-filled niche for Amador
County in the coming exposition of the world's indus
tries and resources. There exists no organization to
this end. Our Board of Supervisors has not moved in
the matter at all. It would amount almost to a reflec
tion upon our loyalty and devotion to our section to
suffer Amador County to default at the St. Louis expo
sition." ' â¢ > ,

- It is* a matter of congratulation that the national
authorities have . seen the wisdom of beautifying the
Presidio, and that work upon this laudable enterprise
will soon begin. Within this Federal reservation there
is now a burial ground second only to Arlington in senti
mental interest, and no more dignified, p'atriotic purpose
than its care and embellishment can inspire officers of
the Government. >
This invention, which promises to rev
olutionize art, is, according to the in
ventor, the discovery of a new law of
nature not previously known and hav
Ing relation to the relative sympathy
that exists between the physical and
mental.
The inventor expects soon to have
stereoscopic pictures in colors, and then
he will be able to furnish paintings
"while you wait" that become realism
itself.
This is the first time that the stereo
scopic effect has ever been brought out
in cinematograph pictures. The discov
erer tried It in a barnyard scene and
the figures came out so lifelike that one
could hardly help feeling that It was
real.
An invention that marks a wonder
ful development in the art of taking
and reproducing cinematograph pic
tures has just been made by an Eng
lishman.
It applies the principles of the stere
oscope to the cinematograph so that
moving figures thrown upon a screen
do not appear flat and bodyless. but
stand out with a depth and fullness
that makes them look exceedingly life
like. *V-: '

Amidst the din in the courtroom the
Judge's voice was heard: "The court
will take>Â«. recess for ten minutes."
He left the bench, warning the bai
liff not to interfere, and watched the
scrap with the keenest delight. Fin
ally the reporter landed a straight
right on the clerk's jaw and knocked
him out. The clerk was led out of
the courtroom, the Judge resumed his
seat on the bench and the business
was continued as if nothing had hap
pened. ',
The popularity of the late Police
Judge Campbell among the masses
was largely due to the fact that he
allowed common sense to sway 'him
in his judgments. Many a time an
attorney' would asseverate: "But, your
Honor, the Supreme Court has decid
ed â " That -would be as far as he
would get, as the Judge would inter
rupt him with: "I overrule the Su
preme Court."
The Judge was fond of seeing a
scrap, and one that gave him unmixed
joy happened In his own courtroom.
The reporter of a morning paper and
the clerk in the Judge's court would
occasionally pass uncomplimentary
remarks about one another and the
Judge, who disliked the clerk, told
ihe reporter not to stand any of the
clerk's nonsense. One day the re
porter asked the clerk to let him ex
amine a complaint that had been
sworn to. The clerk refused in an
offensive manner and the reporter
slapped him on the face. The clerk
jumped to his feet and in an instant
he and the reporter were mixing
things up.

THE first report of Secretary Cortclyou of the new
Department of Commerce reveals the possibilities
of that new Government agency. It takes jurisdic
tion of the corporations engaged in interstate commerce,
and is to make effective the. President's enlightened
ideas of a publicity that will protect investors in the
stocks of trusts and corporations and will also protect
the consuming public against the predatory designs of
any corporation. The Supreme Court, in affirming the
constitutionality of the interstate commerce law, decided
that the restraint end control of such corporations as
do buVness between the States is a constitutional func
tiori. The Department of Commerce is a necessary out
growth of that decision, since the Government must
have, deposited in one place, the power and jurisdiction
which it has of right in the premises.
Secretary Cortelyou, in his first report, says: "The
creation of the Bureau of Corporations in this depart
ment was an expression of the popular belief that fur
ther safeguards should be provided for the regulation of
business entct prises, to which special privileges have
been granted by the people. Publicity will disclose unfair
dcslings, dishonesty and corruption, but if properly en
forced will not discJose to trade competitors the fruits
of individual thrift and initiative, nor permit in any
manner the invasion of private rights.".
It will be observed that the functions of this depart
ment are bestowed to effect a demonstration that will
decide a great issue. On one side are those who ener
getically contend that all utilities and activities incident
to community life must belong to the Government, and
be in public ownership and administration. On the other
sfde are' those who stand by our existing system of gov
ernment and our time-tried institutions, and insist that
the regulating power of the. Government, its proper
function, can restrain all oppression and prevent any
improper use of the opportunity of organization by cap
ital. The President clearly defined this in his remarks
on labor -and capital. The Federal Government, in pur
suance of its constitutional power, enacts laws to define
and protect all rights within its jurisdiction, and it has
the power to enforce the law it has made.
The Socialist school declares that the Government,
having failed to regulate the use of property in private
hands, has, by that failure, proved its capacity to admin
ister all property in Government ownership. The posi
tion ,is illogical. It has been heretofore demonstrated
that the Government can provide and enforce a remedy
for every wrong, and it will do so to the end. Secretary
Cortclyou is proving to be the right man in the right
place, and the people rest confidently in his capacity to
prevent -unjust aggression and protect their rights, to
the extent of the power confided to him by Congress.

James "W. Davidson, United States
Consul to Formosa, has written an
account of a unique tribe living on a
small island adjacent to Formosa,
who have a house for each season of
the year â cold, wet and dry- Each
family possesses a splendid walled and
stone paved .compound, wherein are
three distinct houses, attesting the
cleverness of the natives and their de
sire to obtain the maximum of com
fort. One house, built half tinder
ground, is their winter residence. For
the warmer weather they have a com
fortable building, elevated some feet
above ground, and for protection
against the heat of summer they have
a tower-like edifice, sufficiently ele
vated to catch the cool breezes. These
huts serve not only as habitations, but
also as workshops and storehouses.
In construction a considerable amount
of wood is used as supports and cross
beams and for the inner floor, celling
and walls of the two large huts. The
elevated structure is of wood, bamboo
and straw. A shelf projects level with
the entrance and the inhabitants are
obliged to mount this and then crawl
in on all fours, the doorway not being
much larger than the entrance to a
good sized dog kennel.
The room is like a large flat box.

then said, 'Over IS.' I gave her the
completed license and she started for
the door. She partly opened it and
stood there Just for a moment. 'With
a eish. she shut it and came back to
the desk. 'Please take it back,' shÂ«
said. 'I am onlv IT.' "
Gravely the battered old lawyer held
the document before his sightless eyes,
turning the j pages slowly and mum
bling to himself as if conning the lines
carefully. At las\ he closed the paper
with a flourish.
"Oh, yes." said he, "this will be a
very simple process. . I â ah â that is â
maybe we can open negotiations with
a little drink; place right around the
corner."
"Ahem," said "Judge" Blank, with
the dry throatiness which used to awe
juries. "Now there is that Lawson case
which I have on to-day and the Mur
phy battery case and the consultation
with Peter Dunne â but I believe that
I can give your case some "attention
notwithstanding. Let me see the pa
per."
"Yes, there is a lawyer over there
w ho can advise you on your case." One
of the florid faced young men from
the Hall of Justice indicated the stoop
ed figure of "Judge" Blank to the rus
tic who presented his anxious face be
fore him. Then as the country man
hurried over to the old lawyer the
young man from the hall dropped in
to get a drink on the strength of his
good joke.
"Excuse me, sir. but they tell me
that you are a lawyer, and I have a
document here which I would like â
the huddled figure of "Judge" Blank
straightened up into a shaking sem
blance of dignity; a trembling hand
stole ud to button the top button of
the wrinkled overcoat, so that the ab
sence of the collar would be concealed.
Then he turned in the direction of the
man who had accosted him.
They all know him dc-wn around the
Police Courtâ poor old "Judge" Blank,
the broken down lawyer. Tapping his
way along the lower end of Montgom
ery street, with his shrunken tan over
coat bunched at the shoulders and his
almost sightless eyes staring straight
to the front, the man who once won
the sobriquet of "Judge" in the past
days of his glory, is now one of that
number of derelicts wnose homes are
in the garrets above the fish markets
and whose only boon in life ia to take
the sun along: the crowded thorough
fares of the wholesale districtâ and eat
when fortune smiles.

be different, for the Chicago building is severely void of
every striking and impressive feature in architecture.
It is mistaken by strangers for a grain elevator built of
stone. It belongs to no order of architecture, but defies
them all. The idea in its construction seems to have
been simply to get walls and a roof, and the effect falls
far below that of a bank barn in Berk6 County, Penn
sylvania. \
We do not know whether the plan was made by a
private architect. If it were there must have been an
oxteam pull to get it approved by the Government. Per
haps, however, it suits Chicago and reflects Chicago
taste. This makes it more imperative that our building
reflect the higher and better and more refined taste of
San Francisco. We have looked long upon the pitted
face of the old Custom-house and have endured it as a
brick and mortar nightmare. Now we want something
that will keep company with our splendid Postofiice
building, and will not be shamed by the beautiful archi
tecture of so many of our private buildings.
OUR NEW CUSTOM-HOUSE.
Xext we come to another close-quar
ter* maneuver, known as'. *'lnfight
ir.g." This is what its name Jmplies â
literally fighting or boxing inside your
opponent's guard. Let me illustrate:
Make y6ur sparring partner lead for
your face with his left. Rsise your
r ight ami, knock his blow outward,
and then, without drawing your arm
b3ck. send a right hook or Jolt to his
jaw. The guarding of his blow and
the turning; of your arm inward to
ward his jaw should follow each other
with lightning rapidity. If you do thi3
r;uicfcJy he'eannot guard your blow, as
liis right arm Â¦will have been thrown
outward and your hand will be nearer
his unguarded face than will his own
glove. Speed and accuracy 3re-abso
lute requisites for all forms of in
fighting. It must be on almost simul
taneous right-left gesture of your
right fist, and then get back .on truard.
Another good plan is to lure your
opponent into clinching', and as he at
tempts to do so to uppcrcut him. I
fball explain the uppercul in the next
lessors. If you ure a heavier man than
your antagonist you can woar him
down by repeatedly clinching in the
follow: jig manner:
Put your hands or forearms on his
jshovilders es you rome to a clinch,
and. throwing your whole weight on
hirB. let your hands or arms siip slow
ly down his upper arm to the elbow,
forcing him meanwhile to bear tip
your whole u/> ight. In time this will
have on his crm nnd back muscles
ipmejtjlAt i'ue same effect as would the
lifting of a long succession of .flour
barrels. 'Â¦'â¢':.
If h man trie3 to c!inrh with you, us
ing the "hand clinch" (the fir.?t of the
two I have explained), try to elude him
if you Â«Io not w!sh to clinch, and try
to !Â»nd on him at close quarters.
If h* 1 trios to throw his arms around
you endeavor lo keep both your arms
up gbr,ve his and to send in joits or
half-hooks Lo his face.
rilzsimmons is a past master at this,
r::id taught me Iho trick of working the
arms up through the other mans grip
until bcih arms are free to* send in a
chower of short-arm blows to the face.

see two men apparently clinch. They
eee one of the two hit the other. They
shout "Foul I" Now, the chances art
that the man who struck the blow had
ft perfect right to strike. A clinch, uy
the definition I have already given,
f hculd prevent the opponent from using
his hands. If it does not prevent him
it is no real clinch.
If a man rushes on another and
tbro-.vs his arms about him, that does
not debar lh< latter from striking him
?f he can. If the clinch is complete the
Â¦second man cannot strike. If it is so
Ineffective that he can still use his
arms, let him use them. There is nÂ»
foul in that. It is clean boxing, and
utterly unlike the practice of "hanging
on" with one hand or arm and striking
with the other. The man whose oppo
nent is trying to clinch must not, of
course, hold his antagonist while nit
tins him, but as long as he can keep
his arms free there is no reason why
he Ebould not lead.
Never, under any circumstances,
Fhould a clinch be allowed to degener

It is an amazing spectacle. The effect upon the mind
of Eastern Asia must be left to the imagination. After
several' generations of their statesmen have dealt with
the West, entirely upon, the question of opening their
countries to the world, they find RusSia, with vast
armies, a navy, forts and all the resources of power,
among them to undo all that has been done.
Morally the world owes to China, Korea and Japan
every possible support in this crisis. The United States
holds a high position of moral power at this moment,
because of our stand for freedom of the isthmus. Eng
land is more intimately involved, by her treaty of alli
ance with Japan and her understanding with Russia, that
Korean independence is to be respected. Germany, in
view of her commercial ambitions, cannot be indifferent,
and France, notwithstanding her Russian alliance,
cannot fail to understand that she is affected by abbre
viating her expectations of Eastern trade, for which she
has sacrificed so much in Cochin China. But, above and
beyond all these considerations, individual to the dif
ferent nations, is the claim of Russia, backed by a mili
tary force that is on the ground by virtue of base viola
tion of her promise to evacuate Manchuria, to the right
to reverse the policy of the world in the East.
Three years ago the Czar indicated his purpose,' at
a certain date, to close Russian ports to all but Russian
ships. He shuts other people out of Russia, as far as
possible, by dishonoring passports and by police espion
age, and it begins to look as though the rest of the
world is approaching the duty of opening Russia, as
Eastern Asia was opened. If that come, many scores
will have to be settled.
By policy, part of _ the time, and by open aggression,
in which were incidents discreditable to the West, like
the opium war and the loot of Peking, China was opened
to the world. To the United States fell the task of
opening Japan and, to our credit, it was executed with
out the demoralizing events which had taken place in
China. The Chinese, with a keen and trained commer
cial instinct, took what advantage they could of the
change. Acting upon the keen saying of Marquis Tseng,
that when China was opened to the world the world was
opened to China, her merchants located in the Straits
Settlements, in Australia, the Philippines and the United
States.
Here we have found the Chinese merchants to be
promoters of our trade with their country. More than
a third of the tariff revenue paid in the San Francisco
Custom-house is by the Chinese. Their enterprise and
their high sense of commercial honor, make the for.ee
that has expanded our trade with their country. The
Japanese commercial class, whije less numerous among
us. serves the same purpose. The policy of the Western
nations in opening Eastern Asia has proved good and
wise for them, and for the peoples to whom it gave
access. It has been in the interest of civilization and
has promoted peaceful commerce, mutually beneficial.
This policy has continued unbroken until the advent of
Russia into Eastern Asia. The government of the Czar
appears there with an army and key in hand to compel
a reversal of the open-world policy, insisting upon
closing the door to every country but herself. Russia
has, therefore, against the wish of both China and Korea,
renewed the policy of isolation and restriction, which
the West broke down, and\ insists upon exclusiveness
and isolation.
In the quotation from Secretary Cass by the Presi
dent, in his recent message, to which we have already
referred, Cass used this policy as an illustration. Speak
ing of the claims of Central American governments to
exclusive control of facilities which belong to the world,
Cass said: ""None of these local governments would be
permitted, in a spirit of Eastern isolation, to close the
gates of intercourse, on the great highways of the
world." That uttered the policy of the Western nations
in opening Eastern Asia. It is a policy upon which too
much in trial and sacrifice has been spent to abandon
it now. even though great Russia lifts against it her
powerful arm. She is now in Korea, armed to resist the
opening of the Korean Sport-; .of Yongampho to the
world's commerce. She ha'S no right there which the
other nations can respect. She has no treaty with Korea
giving her fleets the entry of Chemulpo on such ah
errand. While Korea is the immediate victim, too weak
to resist, the world is the ultimate sufferer.
Americans may, with benefit to themselves, contrast
the attitude of our country on the isthmus with that of
Russia in Korea. We appear as the champion of the
world's right of use of a great highway of commerce,
the trustee of civilization, the promoter of all commerce;
not to close, but to open, opportunities which give
greater value to every man's labor, and greater profit to
every man's enterprise. We are the trustee of Russia
and of all nations and propose, with vigor and zeal, to
administer that trust. But Russia appears in the East;
in a spirit of selfishness and isolation, to close the gates,
to lock the door, to exclude the world from its just
opportunities.
MONGOLIAN ASIA, after wars and foreign en
terprises, migration that extended to the Medi
terranean, and experiments in finance and gov
ernment that are yet in issue in other nations, went
home, re-entered its own gates and locked them. There
the modern world , found China, Korea and Japan. The
Western nations, attracted by the mystery on the inner
side of the great wall in the Hermit Kingdom and in the
Japanese islands, concerted in . the policy of opening
all those countries to the world. .
IT is very gratifying to this city that we arc to have a
new Custom-house, ample to accommodate the rapid
ly increasing necessities of our growing commerce,
and of a nobility of architecture that will satisfy the
pride of our people. The plan of the building, {exterior
and intPiiorl should not be permitted to decline from the
high- note struck by the new Postofiice, which is in all
respects one of the finest Federal buildings in the
country. It closely approaches the charms of form and

ington one of the noblest structures in the world.

of that conscience of the mind.

The iron ore. coke and limestone are
not thrown into the blast furnace hap
hazard. On the contrary, the mixture
is made on a. wcU considered plan, de
termined by chemical analysis. The
proper , proportion . of ore to coke and
limestone Is established by the chem
ical mako-up of the fuel, flux and ore.
When tho mass is once in the furnace
and the oxygen-bearing blast is roar
ing through the tuyers and driving hot
gasts and air up through the spongy
coke and ore the iron, warming up,
begins to shake off the oxygen which
has been its companion underground
for years. As the metallurgists put it,
the ore parts with its oxygen to the
carbonic oxide, forming carbonic acid.
The ore, shedding its oxygen, descends
into the zone of reduction, and here the
iron begins making violent love to the
carbon, absorbing it greedilyâ that Is,
if there is not much silicon' present.
Silicon and sulphur Have the effect of
lowering the amount of carbon which
iron will take up. Sulphur Is not want
ed in iron, so the ironmaker is careful
that Tils fuel shall not contain sulphur,
at least not enough to injure the iron.
The mass 1 of 'ore, coke and flux de-
Bcends, getting hotter and hotter, thÂ»j
chemical actions become more rapid
and soon the particles of iron, separat
ed at 3aet from the dross, drip down
through the zone of fusino, passing
through an inferno where the gas biast
reaches a temperature -of 3500' to 4000
decrees Fahrenheit. v_
Tbe blast furnace is divided into
three zones; above the hearth comes
the zone of gassification, next above
that is the zone of fusion and above
1hat the zone of reduction. These
zone? have no well defined boundaries,
for they merge into each other almost
insensibly. As the iron passes through
these divisions or zones it makes des
perate love to the oxygen, carbon, sili
con, sulphur and phosphorus, leaving
one to take up the other, flirting and
coquetting until at last, wedded for
the time being to carbon, it emerges
quietly from the "tapping hole," a
steady, substantial citizen of the in
dustrial world.
In order to separate the foreign mat
ters present in the ore from the iron
an intense heat must be used and the
fuel is coke, anthracite or charcoal.
Fluxes are required to facilitate this
separation, and limestone is the ma
terial most employed. The fluxes trans
form ihe earths and extraneous mat
ter into slag, which is used afterward
for railway ballast and for making
cement and bricks.
A blast furnace eighty feet high is
about twenty-three feet at its largest
diameter, which is about twenty-five
feet from the bottom. From this point
the stack tapers both ways. About
eight or ten feet from the bottom the
furnace becomes a cylinder. The top
of the furnace is called the "throat,"
the lower part the "boshes" and the
cylindrical shaped bottom is the
"hearth." About four feet from the
bottom are the "tuyers," through
which the blast enters the furnace, and
the "tapping hole" is almost at the
bottom.
The blast furnace is' a 1 huge brick
stack, not unlike a gigantic . bottle
standing on its cork end. The ore,
coke and limestone are fed into the
stack on top, and the melted, refined
iron escapes from the tap hole in the
bottom and runs into open sand molds,
-where it cools into the pig iron of
commerce. This pig iron contains from
92 to 5*4 per cent of pure Iron and 8 to 6
per cent of impurities. Before it can be
used in the arts this pig iron must be
remelted in a puddling furnace â or
some other kind of furnace â or the
cupola of a foundry.
Immense air compressors are used in
the reduction of the ore In the blast
furnaces, for each ton of iron made
requires from three to six tons of air,
which is forced into the blast furnace
under a pressure of five to ten pounds
to the square inch.
This blast of air is heated to a tem
perature up as high as 1500 degrees
Fahrenheit before it enters the furnace.
The air pumped into the furnace ex
ceeds in weight the combined weight
of all the ore, coke and limestone
which is "charged" into the "throat"
of the blast turnace.
Chemically pure iron has no commer
cial value. Its impurities, called metal
loids, are what give iron its character
and strength. The iron ores as they
come from ihe mine are a. combination
of iron, oxygen, silica, phosphorus, sul
phur, carbon and other elements, and
the blast furnace is employed to sep
arate the metal from the ore impurities.
Pure iron ore is a chemical combina
tion of metallic iron and oxygen, the
most common consisting of about 70
per cent iron and 30 per cent oxygen.
But the earthy impurities and combina
tions of other elements enter so inti
mately into the structure of the iron
ore that the blast furnace man must
reckon with all of them in his efforts
to separate the metal from the dross.
In the process of the reduction of the
ore the oxide of iron â the oreâ becomes
carbide of ironâ pig iron.

OAKLAND, Dec. 10. â The City
Council in executive session to-night
decided to fight the water rates case
to the end. This action was taken
after Councilman A. H. Elliott, as a
special committee of one, had made
a report on a resolution recently
adopted by the Council on motion of
Councilman John L. Howard, calling
for an investigation as to the status
of the litigation. The principal point
involved was whether the city would
be gainer by continuing the appeal
through the Supreme Court from
Judge Hart's decision, which fixed a
$7,000,000 valuation on the Contra
Costa Water Company's plant for rate
fixing purposes.
After listening to Councilman Elli
ott the members of the Council came
to the conclusion that the appeal
should be carried forward with all
expedition. It was argued that the
public mind in Oakland was set upon
a final judicial determination of the
long fought suit, which was inaugu
rated by the Contra Co3ta j Water
Company in opposition -to tthe action
of the City Council of 1900 in cutting
the water rates.

SAN JOSE DE GUAYMAP. Mexico,
Dec. 10. â Runners arriving from San
grrman have just brought news of a
terrible slaughter of ranchers by Yaqui
and Seri Indians. Appeals for assist
ance were urgent. Troops have already
been dispatched from Hermosillo and
relief parties from other points.
A band of fifty Seris and Yaquis first
made their appearance at El Pozo
ranch, near San German. James Fox,
the American proprietor of the ranch,
his wife and his mon, were at their
noon meal when they were warned of
the Indians' approach by the barking
of dogs. Thev found a half dozen
naked Yaquis and Seris at the door beg.
King for food. This was eventually
proven to be a ruse to decoy the un
suspecting American and his Mexican
employes from the house. While the
ranchmen were gathered about the
n^.vagcs the whole band of Seris and
Yaquis appeared from behind a hill
near the house and began firing. Only
a few had rifles, but the others were
armed with bows and arrows. Fox,
Tomas Basozabal and Cruz Barra fell.
Fox's wife succeeded in escaping
through the house to the outbuilding,
where she was successful in concealing
herself while the savages looted the
ranch house. Two Mexican women em
ployed on the ranch were killed along
with the men.

Three other comets were seen at the
same time this most interesting visi
tor was in the neighborhood of the
earth, a full account of which appears
in bulletin No. 4 9, now being issued
from the observatory to correspond
ents.
BERKELEY, Dec. 10. â A comet
that was first observed fourteen years
ago and disappeared after a brief
visit has just repeated its perform
ance in front of the big thirty-six inch
telescope at Mount Hamilton. This
heavenly tramp was discovered by Dr.
Brooks in 1889, who kept track of it
for two months until it wandered out
of sight. Since then the astronomers
have been looking for the nomad's
return and recently the vigilance of
Dr. Aitken of Lick Observatory was
rewarded by a sight of it. The comet
again remained within view for two
months, affording a good opportunity
for studying its movements. The
comet was not seen, apparently, any
where else during the present appari
tion, as'the Lick observers were not
informed by other observers of its dis
covery.
This evening the ladies tendered a
reception to the delegates, after which
a lecture was delivered bv Joaquin
Miller.
Then the men again took the floor
and proceeded to tell how the fruit
could be made more profitable. The
pession closed with a general discus
sion.
The afternoon session was in charge
of the ladies. The first paper was read
by Mrs. E. Shafter Howard on the sub
ject of "Co-operation and Organiza
tion." Mrs. Amos Harris followed with
a paper full of good ideas on "Train
ing of the Children in Rural Improve
ment Ideas." "The Flower Garden"
was the subject of an address by Mrs.
Frank E. Cook. It was a departure
from the practical, or rather profitable
idea which has predominated all
through the sessions, but she showed
how home can be made beautiful, and
her effort was listened to with much
attention.
Professor A. J. Cook of Los Angeles
County had another scientific paper
about unfriendly insects, the title of
which was "Our Scale Pests." This
was a description in popular language
of the methods best adapted to the
remedy of the pests infesting orchards.
"New Observations on the Codlin
Moth" was the subject treated by Pro
fessor C. W. Woodworth. It was al
most noon when it was reached, but
the growers wanted to hear the paper,
and on motion the session was pro
longed for half an hour. Delegates who
planned a trolley ride had to leave
early, but the large majority remained
to listen to Professor Woodworth and
to Professor Warren T. Clarke, whose
paper on spraying operations in the
Pajaro Valley was a companion con
tribution to Professor Woodworth's.
The general conclusions were that
these friendly insects have done ev
erything expected of them, and that
the State should be thanked for giving
them every encouragement.
E. M. Ehrhorn, Horticunltural Com
missioner of Santa Clara County, read
another valuable paper, the subject of
which was '"Insects of the Year," a
resume of what is new in the field of
insect ravages and the remedies for
them.
The first paper at this morning's ses
sion was read by Professor H. E.
Twight of the State University. He
took as his subject "Xursery Grafting,"
and told of the work at the State Ex
perimental Station at Berkeley. Pro
fessor Twight went thoroughly into his
subject and at the conclusion was ac
corded a vote of thanks.
Alexander Craw of San Frane'sco
read the next paper. He took for his
subject "Friendly Insect?." It was an
exhaustive review of what has be*n
done in the introduction of those in
sects which by destroying others that
are fatal in orchards and vineyards de
serve to be classed among the best
friends of the horticulturist.
FRESNO, Dec. 10.â The third days
session of the State Fruit Growers'
convention was something of a depart
ure from those that had preceded it.
The afternoon and evening were given
over to the ladies. Women made the ad
dresses in the afternoon and they cer
tainly were no less practical or enrVr
taining than ihose delivered at other
sessions of the convention. This even
ing they gave a delightful reception in
Armory Hall, after which Joaquin
Miller delivered an interesting lecture.
A. R. Sprague brought forward an
addition to Berwick's postal reform
motion looking to an improvement in
the manner of money remittances
through the mails. Judd of Santa Cruz
submitted -a resolution providing for an
amendment of the procedure at the
n^xt convention, which would indicate
that there is a feeling of dissatisfaction
because so much Hire has been devoted
to polemics. Mr. Judd's motion was
that at th? next convention the first
three days Le given ever to the discus
sion of fruit culture.

in regard to the complaint of Mrs. Me-
Connell that it had not acted fairly

young HcConnelL There was a de
ficit of $256. which the club made
goo<? after the purse and other ex
penses had been paid. The committee
postponed consideration of the com
plaint until next Thursday, when the

Unless something unforeseen happens
the committees from the Waiters' and
Cooks' unions will meet a' lilie commit
tee from tha Restaurant Keepers' As
sociation this morning at 20 Eddy street
and settle thsir differences. Secretary
F. A. Swain of the association was au
thorized last evening to send a com
munication to the unions Inviting them
to a conference and hs sent the follow
ing letter: y
. San Francisco, Dec. 10, 1933.
Burt La Kue. Secretary Local Joint Execu
tive Itoard â Dear Sir: Answering your com
munication of even date, the executive com
mittee of thU association requests me to iitate
that the dally press Is In error, as we have
rent no communication to the Cooks' and Walt
ers' tinier.* since Friday 1m:. the 4th Inst.
The re<i'Jf ct for a conference, was not prop
erly made. a.Â» Mr. Johnson, though chairman
of the board, waiÂ» net authorized to receive a
verbal one, and he *o informed the committee.
If the CookV Union No. 4i and the Waiters'
Union No. ;>O desire a confer. nee and will so
Inform ui", our committee Is willing: to meet
tnfcm. the meat convenient time for us being
11 o'clock to-monow morning.
The hall at 20 Eddy street, where the board
of arbitration mtt, will undoubtedly be at our
disposal. Yours truly,
F. A. SWAIX, Secretary.
Committees from the association
wore engaged yesterday visiting the
various restaurants o* the city with
a view to getting the uroprietors to
agree to close if so requested. Accord
ing to Chairman M. Johns >i of the
executive commutes of the association
the committees met with great success,
and if the present trouble Is not ad
justed more_ places wlil close thsir
doors.
One of the strongest objections the
association hasi mad2 to the agreement
which the unions are attempting to
have individual restaurant keepers
sign permits such places as Zinkand's,
Techau's and the ' 'Lobvre to have an
"open house." This means .they may
employ non-union help and pay them
$3? 50 a month_and work th.^m twelve
hours a day, whereas .tho restaurant
keeper is forced to employ union men
and only work them ten hours a day
ardfpay them not less than |io 51 a
week. They further object to U12 agree
ment because It v/il! hold good until
13C5.
VThis is thprvflr'st time any communi
cation' has been, received > from .the
unions ; since the tronble - began." said
Chairman Johnson. "The unions claim

and Waiters' Unions To-Day
ANOTHER COSTLY FIRE AT
SEVENTH AND BRAXXAX
Smith Corhpany Loses Second Ware
house in a Year, Latest Loss Being
Estimated at $35,000.
For the second time inside of a year
the H. P. Smith Company, S10 and S12
Brannan street,, has suffered the less
of a hay and grain warehouse with
contents. Last night" the structure
erected by that company to replace the
one destroyed a few months ago
was burned. This is the third big fire
in this locality during the year.
About 10:30 o'clock Watchman David
Henry, .who is employed by the San
Francisco Hay Compress Company, on
Seventh street near Brannnn, discov
ered the blaze near the roof of the
Smith barn and turned in an alarm.
As soon as the Fire Department ar
rived on the scene a second alarm was
turned in. Chief Sullivan headed the
fire flshters and the main efforts of
the derrartment were directed to the
saving of the McNab and Smith stor
age barns next to the burning ware
house. The. east and south walls gave
way and the firemen were compelled \o
run for their lives." Hcserrran William
Hart of engine No. 6 was caught by
the falling hay and stunned. He \yas
quickly "dragged from the debris and
conveyed to a nearby saloon, where he
soon recovered.
The loss to the HAP.' Smith'Company
will amount, to about '$35,000, almost
fully covered by insurance.- McNab &
Smith"s loss is JoOO.
It is thought by the firemen that a
spark from the flpfi of Sunday night
next to Smith's warehouse may. have
lodged in the hay fiSid smoldered until
it broke into flames"*last night. Super
intendent Comstock of the. Fire Patrol
and Fire Marshal To\ve hint at incen
diarism.

The Grand Jury commenced its in
vestigation last evening of the adminis
tration of the County Clerk's office un
der the regime of A. B. Mahony and the
alleged manipulations of the monthly
pay rolL
Harry Barbee was the first witness
called into the jury room. He testi
fied that he secured his position in the
County Clerk's office through Bier &
Regensberger, salary brokers, and that
he took the oath of office while in their
presence. Barbee testified to giving the
salary brokers assignments of his sal
ary for eight months and said that
through them he drew $75 per month,
while his salary warrant called for $125.
He said he did not know who received
the $50 balance of his salary. He fur
ther testified that he had worked con
tinuously for the last three months
and that no salary warrant was drawn
for him for September and that hi?
name only appeared for twenty days in
November.
Barbee was asked if he knew of Mar
tin Brady, A. Davidson, J. A. McKenBa
and J. Pierce working as deputies in the
County Clerk's office and he replied
that he did not. The names of the
four mett mentioned appear on the pay
rolls certified to by Mahony.
"Colonel" Martin Brady was next
called before the Jurors'and he claimed
that he worked as a deputy under Ma
hony. When asked how many days
he had worked In the last three months,
he replied, "The records are the best
evidence."
Questioned as to Davidson, McKenna
cr Pierce working in the office, Brady
replied that "he did not keep watch
on the others and it was not his duty
to do so."
J. A. McKenna testified that he^did
not know how Mahony conducted hip
office and said it was his duty to draw
the salary warrants and make' out the
pay roll as directed by Mahony.
Although McKenna's work would or
dinarily tak.Â» one day, the witness said
that he worked every day of the week
during the month. He made the same
answer as Brady to the question as to
certain men working in the officeâ that
it was not his business to keep watch
en the other clerks.
Henry Ingeerson. Deputy, Auditor,
testified to the identity of the pay rolls
of the County Clerk's office and thÂ£
salary warrants certified to by Mahony.
Regensbergor, the salary broker, was
then called before the Jurors. He de
nied the assertions of Barbee, who
claimed that the, broker had held out
$50 of each monthly salary. Regens
berger claimed that Barbee had been
advanced money each month, depositing
an assignment of his salary as secur
ity. When the broker collected -the
salary Barbie received the balance due
him, less interest, claimed Regensber
ger.
The investigation will be taken up
Again this afternoon at 3. when Ma
hony will be called before the Jury.

The big main event of the Lincoln
Athletic Club's show did not take place
last night, and there was disappoint
ment in the faces of the followers of
the game who had turned out" by the
hundreds to see it. Frank Manasso,
who looks like Jeffries andVho was to
have put up his mitts against "Mick"
Dunn, failed to come through at the
last moment, so a poor old man who
called himself Jack Sullivan took up
the burden and was handed the wallop.
Sullivan was old and feeble and could
not go. He kept offlcing up to,the Irish
terror in an effort to keep from get
ting hit, and the letter was kind
enough to leave him alone. The pair
swung at each other for a while, and
then they clinched for another while.
Just before the gong sounded Sullivan
went to the carpet and forgot to arise,
so it Mas curtains then with the main go.
The bout between Joe Larkin and
Jack Burke made up for the farcical
main event. Such slugging has not
been seen In an amateur- arena for
many a day. They began to pass the
wallop around in the first period, and
never for a moment did they show
signs of slackening their speed.
Each scored a clean knockdown in
the initial round. They continued to
fight just as fast in the next spasm.
The third v,-as the best round, and
whon it was over both men were cov
ered with gore, but still ready to go on.
They kept up the pace in the last
round, and Burke was awarded the de
cision for his better all around tactics.
Tom Sullivan outpointed Joe Podesta
in a four-round affair that contained
lots of fighting. Sullivan had his man
nearly out in the last two rounds and
displayed a world of cleverness. Dick
Richards outpointed Jack Gomersal in
four rounds. Joe Kelly got the decision
over Jack Bradshaw in four rounds.
Willie Frlel defeated Willie Grady in
the same space of time.
Jack Welch, the ofEcial referee of
the Colma Athletic Ctib, will be the
third man in the ring to-night when
Ferguson and Johnson. clash for twen
ty rounds in the San Mateo County
fighting pavilion.
Spider Kelly, who will be Ferguson's
chief gecond. has not been friendly
Â¦with Welch for some years and he ad
vised the Boston man to hold out for
Eddie Graney. The representatives of
the fighters and of the club met last
night to name the refereÂ£. There was
a deadlock for a time and then Zick
Abrams, acting for Johnson, suggested
that slips of paper bearing the names
of Graney and Welch be placed in a
hat and that Ferguson's manager, A.
A. McLean, draw one out. This was
done and the slip bearing Welch's
name was drawn.
The betting went to 10 to 4 last
night, but there was little money wag
ered. Ferguson has few admirers who
concede him a chance against a man
of Johnson's known cleverness.
Johnson took two short trips on the
road yesterday, but did no boxing.
After he came off the road in the aft
ernoon he did a few moments of
â¢shadow boxing." which ended his
training for the fight.
This morning he will take n short
walk Just to keep in trim. In the aft
ernoon he will cross the bay and will
rest until it is time to start for Colma.
The big colored mans condition is all
he could wish. His muscles are firm
and pliant and every movement shows
the thoroughly trained athlete. John
son says: "I feel like a winner. Dur
ing the time I have been training
everything has srone well, and I h:ive
not a single complaint to make. As
far as I know I am in perfect shape
and if I lose it will be because Fergu
son is a better man. If I win, as I
think I will, I hope I will get a chance
to box Jeffries for the championship-"
Ferguson's friends claim Johnson
does not take kindly to punishment
end that their man will surely land on
him. Manager McLean says: "I have
seen them fljrht twice and have a good
Use on Johnson's ability. The colored
champion will have to be 50 per cent
better than he was on the previous
meetings, or he will not have a chance
with Sandy."
The gymnasium of the Olympic Ath
letic Club presented an animated ap
pearance last evening. It was "ladles*
night," and the fair friends of the
members crowded the clubhouse and
enjoyed an excellent entertainment.
The Columbia Park Eoys* Club, an ad
junct of the Olympic Club, sent forth
its young soldiers and athletes to ehow
the members and their friends how
cleverly they could drill and perform.
Small boys were they, and their work
created surprise to the onlookers. The
little athletes showed careful training
in all departments and were heartily
applauded for their~"work.
The class in parallel bars brought
forth a bunch of sturdy youngsters,
who went through remarkable evolu
tions. The choral singers of the club
raised their sweet voices in melody,
and were repeatedly encored. The tum
bling was fine and created a great deal
of favorable comment.
The feature of the entertainment was
the singing of Master. Talbot. He ren
dered the "Congo Love Song" so beau
tifully that the fair ones in the audi
ence wanted to hug him. The Moresca
Club, a band of Slavonians, gave a
realistic imitation of a battle. They
called it "Moresca," and used long
knives to heighten the effect. The
blades glistened and the clash of steel
scared many. The actors In the drama
showed great skill in wielding the
knives and in dancing. They were
picturesque in their native costume.
The lads from the Columbia Park
Boys' Club then did fancy buck-jump
ing and performed on the Roman rings.
Master O'Day sang "The Bloom is on
the Rye" and was , applauded for his
efforts.
In the temporary absence of Presi
dent William Greer Harrison the prizes
were awarded by Judge J. C. B. Heb
bard. Henry B. Rues, Adolph Kosh
land and Otto Rittler kept a close
watch on the youngsters who went
through the exercises, and decided
Frank Nagle did the best all-round
work. Herman Stein was best on the
parallel bars, Louis Stein best on the
Spanish rings and Emile Muheim the
best buck Jumper.
In presenting the prizes Judge Heb
bard paid a high tribute to Major Sid
ney Peixotto, who has charge of the
boys. He said Mr. Peixotto was devot
ing his life helping to develop young
manhood. He also took occasion to
speak highly of the men and women
who were contributing their money to
aid this worthy institution. As each
youth v/as called forward he was ap
plauded and returned to the ranks with
a gold or silver medal pinned on his
blouse. The youngsters owe their ath
letic ability to George Schlitter, who is
their instructor.
After the entertainment the visitors
roamed through the big clubhouse.

Their Wonderful Cleverness
on the Bars, Mat and Sings
. TheHypewTlter is more largely used in
Mexico than in France.
The midget rWers had an opportunity
to display their cleverness in the own
ers' handicap yesterday at Oakland race
course. Roscoe Coleman, who is about
as tall as a peg?- bottle, carried off the
honors.
Roscoe had tTie mount on Walter Jen
nings' filly Detinty, doing 65 pounds^
and his mount Tvas accorded scant con
sideration by speculators, her price go
ing from 3 to 6. Burnie Bunton picking
up "Big Bill" Knapp and 76 pounds,
was the actual! favorite, though Bum
mer, ridden by Jimmy Booker .and
shouldering 90 pounds, probably had a
longer retinue of supporters.
Claude, 'with. Willie Daly and 80
pounds in the saddle, had friends, while
Warte Nicht, a 78-pounder, went beg
ging almost in : the market.
Wonderful tales were related about
the speed of Bummer, but when Dick
Dwyer sent the bunch away the little
sprinter could not shake oft Burnie
Bunton. The pair raced on nearly equal
terms to the bend for home, with' Cole
man rating Datnty right at their heels.
Bummer laid down his hand about this
time, and Coleman let out his 'wraps on
Dainty. '
BURXIE BUXYOX TRIES HARD.
Burnie Bunton contested every, foot of
the ground, butÂ»w r as not up to the task,
Dainty winning easily in 1:12%. Out
footed the first part of it. Claude fin
ished strongly, taking the show.
There were other upsets besides this
one, for Saintly and Iridius were the
only winning choices. Lurene, Judge
and Lacy Crawford were all heavily
backed, and the ring must have had a
profitable day. ,
Iridiusi also from the Jennings Bta
ble, carrying no pounds and ridden by
Jack Martin, captured the seven-fur
long handicap in handy fashion . from'
John A. Scott. The betting: all favored
the Golden Garter colt, with Yellow
Tall second and John A. Scott third
choice. Bragg led the favorite for about
three furlongs, and then Martin sent
his mount to the front. Bullman, with
waiting orders on John A. Scott, put in
a challenge in the stretch, but Iridius
held the chestnut perfectly safe and
won with a bit in reserve. Flush of
Gold, a 15 to 1 outsider, ran third.
King, on Yellow Tail, succeeded in get
ting almost left al the post, or the big
horse would have been a contender.
JEXXIE IIIX3I1ES WINS. .
Charley Connell landed the opening
Futurity course scramlble with Jennie
Hughes, a 5 to 1 chancÂ«3. He was cut
off in the stretch once* and then out
stayed Bee Rosewater. Elfin King beat
Pat Morrissey for the. show.
An exceedingly close finish marked
the close of the sevem-furlong number

and Eugenie B finishfcig noses a part.

post a slight favorite, but Grail was
best, although she nearly lost, the ver

NOTES OF THE -TRACK. ......
Charley Connell piloted the win
ners of the first two races. Jack Mar
tin followed by capturing the follow
ing two events. ;.'-;:
Lurene can work faster in the
morning, for fun, than a Chicago
pickpocket at an ' elevated railway
station, but with Bullman in the sad
dle could not deliver the.goods in the
first racoi After one more trial the
mare will be planted in the flower

glories;
Jockey Otto Wonderly is here. He
surveyed things yesterday, and may
decide to take a mount this afternoon.
Arthur Redfern will be out this way
to ride in another week. Joe Yaeger
has first call on his services.
Grail, winner of the last event, was
bid up from $400 to $800 by Al Koen
igsby. The mare was retained by -her
stable. , - < . ; .'. >
Pure Dale was severely kicked while
at the post in the first race by Skip
Me. Th<* latter is a vicious actor.
Johnny Daly, on Judge, put up a
weak finish, as the black colt could
have won.
Johnny Schorr tried blinkers .on
Avenger and the scheme worked
beautifully. Avenger refused to
break from the barrier, acting as if he
had never seen a race track.
Next time King, who rode Yellow
Tail, goes to the post his saddle should
be "collected by wire with a battery
of heavy voltage. A push button
could then be utilized if. manipulated
by a skilled operator to notify him of
the start.; There are 'two: or three

Judge Graham yesterday refused to
issue an order directing the arrest of
Esther Williams, leading lady of "At

recently completed an engagement at
the California Theater. The order
was sought by a theatrical man
named Blackman of Oakland, who
claimed that the actresa whose real
name is Mrs. Cousins, owed him $130
and was about to leave the State with
out paying up. In refusing to make
the order Judge Graham said that
to cause the lady'-K nrrest would be do
ing her an injustice.. He told Black
man .that as she had been in this city
for three weeks he should have had
her haled into court on an order of
examination and not waited until she
was about to leave the cJty before tak 7
Ing action.
The debt is one of long standing,
according to Blackman's statement to
the Judffe. He lent her the money
several years a^ro, and when she did
not repay him he brought suit in the
Justice's court. He got a Judgment
for the amount, but before he could
collect she lclt the city. She came
back here several times in Maud
Granger's company and on each oc
casion' was haled into court to show
cause for her failure -to pay. She
proved each time that she was heav

PERSONALS.
The news that the "Roosevelt
March" had been played by the
band of the United States Military
Academy at West Point filled her
with delight. Bands elsewhere were
already preparing to present it, ' but
her father had been graduated from
West Point and the fact that this in
stitution first played her. march made
her decide to compose and dedicate to
West Point a march which, had she
lived, would probably have been her
next work, and would no doubt have
been one worthy of the high ideals and
splendid achievements of that institu
tion.
Miss Welcker was the daughter of
the late Colonel William T. Welcker.
The funeral will take placabto-day at 2
p. m. from St. Mark's Church, Berkeley.
The "Roosevelt March" she chose to
have published first because she hoped
that, as it is one of her pieces suited
for a military, band, it might be played
by the band of the United States Mili
tary Academy, West Point, a wish
which those in authority were prompt
to comply with." Since her death word
has been received that the Naval Acad
emy of the United States at Annapo
lis is also to play it.
Of her compositions of a more seri
ous nature critics familiar with music
in its higher expression were quick to
discover their classic quality. Such
were the piece entitled "To Rubin
stein," and later a sonata having in its
second part passages of rare beauty.
The untimely death of Miss Henri
etta Welcker at Berkeley comes . as a
shock io many throughout the State
and will be recognized as a loss by
many throughout the East, where her
musical work has aroused much atten
tion, and "has, -because of certain of Its
qualities, aroused in some places the
attention of those who are high author
ities in this department of art.
Although the first" of her musical
compositions to be published, the
"Roosevelt March," which was on
Thanksgiving day played by the Gold
en Gate Park band, is lighter in char
acter than ' have been the majority of
her works, which, being recognized as
classic, have received recognition
and splendid commendation from those
familiar with music in what is consid
ered its more permanent and enduring
expression. .
Landlord J.J.Sweeney of the lodging
house at 114 Pacific street was blamed,
yesterday, by the Coroner's jury for
being the cause of the death of Frank
Elfors, a lodger, 65 years old. Elfors
was found last Wednesday- morning
suffocated in his bed with illuminating
gas escaping from an, open burner In
the room. Sweeney admitted that he
had been in the habit of turning off
the gas at the meter at 9 a, m. and
turning it on again at about 4 p. m.
After hearing Sweeney's statement and
those of other witnesses, the jury re
turned the following verdict:
That the said Frank Elfors died at 114 Pa
cific street on December 9th from I gas as
phyxiation due to the fact that the gas on said
premises was turned off by the manager of
above apartment house at the meter at about
0 a. m. and turned on about 4 p. m. each day
except Sundays and that Â«ald death, from evi
dence produced, was 'due to deceased having re
tired with the gas burning, and that when the
gas was turned off at the meter the flame was
extinguished, and that when the eas was
turned on at the meter said iras entered the
room through' the open Jet and caused the
death of said Frank E'fors.
We bellnve. that ordinance. No. 642 was vio
lated In this case, and recommend that the
proper . authorities take due notice of 'same.
The Jury recommend that the proper authorities
cause copies of ordinance No. (VI2 to be printed
and placed In conspicuous positions, either on
gas meters or In close proximity to same.
Sweeney testified that, although he
had had charge of the building for the
Fair estate during the last thirteen
years, he had never heard of the ordi
nance prohibiting the turning of gas
on and off at the meter. He said also
that he made a daily inspection, occu
pying twenty to twenty-five minutes,
of the 124 rooms In the house to as
sure himself that the stopcocks on the
gas burners were closed. He last saw
Elfors alive on Saturday, lying on a
bed, presumably drunk.- On Monday
Sweeney looked into the room again
and saw him in the same position, but
paid no particular attention, presuming
that. Elfors was drunk.
Coroner Leland explained to the jury
that the ordinance was passed last
March, because a great number of
cases of gas suffocation reported at the
morgue had been caused, undoubtedly,
by tenants going to' sleep with the gas
burning and by landlords turning the
supply off and on at the meter.
After having approved the verdict,
the Coroner notified the police and the
District in order that proper
steps toward the prosecution of
Sweeney might be taken.
The landlord is a brother of Attorney
"Eddie" Sweeney.

That the public will generously re
spond in aiding: the Widows' and Or
phans' Fund of the firemen is a fore
gone conclusion.
While the city government makes
some provision for the families of fire
men who may actually meet death in
the discharge of their duties, there is
no provision made for those left behind
by the brave men. who, owing to tho
nature of their calling, are exposed to
dangers of health that too often result
The firemen of San Francisco main
tain their own association to help the
men of the department who fall ill.
They also contribute stated sums to
the newly formed Widows' and Or
phans' Aid Association. but th^
finances of the organization require as
sistance.
Chief Sullivan and his men are op
posed to the soliciting of subscriptions
and therefore they decided on the The
atrical benefit.
The cost of securing: the Grand Op
era-hoii*yÂ« and the attraction of "The
Little Outcast" for Christmas week is
a larpe one, but the firemen did not
hesitate. They feel that the public
Â¦will respond to (he call and aid the
good" cause. The regular attraction is
cf &cod merit and with the exciting
scenes to be presented by the firemen
themselves the audiences at the Grar.d
Opera-hous* during Christmas week
v.ill be well repaid for visiting the the-
Chief Sullivan and Assistant Chief
Doushc-rty are working hard to make
the benefit a recces* and are personally
superintending the rehearsing of the
fire scenes and the equipment of the
stage with apparatus.
There will be scenes representing an
engine-house with ar>paratus, horses,
telegraphic instruments, sliding poles
and sleeping quarters; the sounding of
the alarm; hitching up the engines;
leaving for a fire; the run to the con
flagration; fighting the fire and saving
life by means of Jumping nets and pom.
pier ladders.
In addition to the regular attraction,
consisting of the drama, "The Out
cast," a spectacular feature will be
given by picked men of the Fire De
partment, showing the methods and
Â¦workings of the firemen in everyday
life.
Plans for the monster week's benefit
for the Widows' and Orphans', Fund of
the San Francisco Fire Department, to
take place at the Grand Opera-house,
commencing Sunday, December 20,
have been comcleted.

b Many women are denied the happiness of
children through derangement of the genera-
tive organs. Mrs. Beyer advises women to use
Lydia E* Pinkham's Vegetable Compound*
"Dear Mrs. Pixkham: â I suffered with stomach complaint for
years. I got so bad that I could not carry ray children but five months,
then would have a miscarriage. The last time I became pregnant, my
husband got me to take Xydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound.
After taking the first bottle I was relieved of the sickness of stomach,
and began to feel better in every way. I continued its use and was
enabled to carry my baby to maturity. I now have a nice baby girl,
and can work better than I ever could before. I am like a new wo-
man."â Mrs. Frank Betbb, 22 S. Second St, Meriden, Conn.
Another case which proves that no other medicine
in the world accomplishes the same results as
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound.

The Pacific Mail Company's steam
ship San Jose, which arrived yester
day from Panama, came into port fly
ing on her fore the flag of the new
republic. She brought 6S7 tons t>Â£ cargo,
treasure valued at $20,867 and nineteen
passengers. Among the' passengers
were three men of the crew of the
schooner Luisa D, which went to Man
zanillo some time ago to recover the
treasure supposed to have been taken
to the bottom of the sea when the
steamshiD Golden Gate was lost.
The returning treasure hunters are
Richard Powers, Patricx McCafferty
and Harry Lappin. They report Cap
tain Johnson's expedition a failure and
say the Luisa D was to be soid a few
days after they left Manzanillo. Heavy
seas smashed the machinery they had
installed on the beach and destroyed
the eold-seekers' hopes of wresting a
fortune from the clutch or the ocean.
The change of government took place
before the Ban Jose reached Panama
and when she entered the southern
harbor the commandant of the port
boarded the liner and ordered Captain
Urown to lower the Colombian flag that
fluttered at the foremast head and sub
stitute the colors of the republic of
Panama. The officers of tho San Jose
report everything quiet at Panama.

their decision the United States local
inspectors says:
"In the matter of the collision be
tween the ferry-boats Oakland and
Newark in a dense fog on San Fran
cisco Bay about 7:22 p. m. October 17
last, upon investigation thereof and
testimony taken we find that both ves
sels on the above occasion were being
navigated with caution, running- slow
and sounding proper fog signals, and
when the pilots in charge of the steam
ers respectively discovered the prox
imity of the two steamers to one
another they did all in their power to
avoid a collision. We are of the opin
ion, therefore, that neither of these
pilots was negligent or unskillful. The
damage to the steamers was slight."

A motion by Attorney Bach for leave
to examine the books of Armour & Co.
in order to secure other information
concerning dealings with Porter Bros.
Company and to secure explanations of
certain puzzling ledger entries present
ed by Robbins was refused by Referee
Wean. The hearing of the case will be
linished on December 14.
Asked why these payments were not
returned to the Porter Bros. Company
Robbins said the reason was that the
company and Watson were regarded
as identical.
CHICAGO. Dec 10.â Seeking further
light on the alleged agreement by
which President James S. Watson of
the defunct Porter Bros. Company
is Bald to have received $700,000
in rebates from the Fruit Growers* Ex
press Company, Attorney Bach, repre
senting the New York creditors, to-day
resumed the examination of George B.
Kobbins?, general manager of the ex
press eompany.before Bankruptcy Ref
eree Wean. Robbins did not give much
information, though he repeated his
former admission that rebates were
quoted to Watsor:. whom he regarded
as tho predominating factor in the Por
ter Bros, concern. Bobbins insisted
that the same charges were made to
oil consignees for refrigeration and
that the rehates were not paid to Wat-
Fon until several months after the ser
vice was performed. Most of this in
formation had been secured before, s=o
Bach directed his inquiry mainly to
the discovery of the railroads which
were supposed to have paid large re
bates to the h'ead of the Porter Bros.
Company. Nothing, however, was
The witness declared that there had
l*<?n no understanding with Watson
by which the New York house of Por
ter Bros, was to be charged more than
the published rates. The same gross
rates were charged to all consignees.
Itobbfns said, though frequently part
of the payments was returned to Wat-
It was resolved .that the several com
mittees constituting the joint confer
ence report to the bodies appointing
them the outcome of the meeting and
secure further instructions a3 to which
of the lines indicated should be pur
sued in future conferences. \ '.;
- "That some form of union closer and
more tangible than any at present ex
isting between the reformed churches,
holding the Presbyterian order, is de
sirable for the furtherance of the work
intrusted to them by the head of the
churches: that such closer union is pos
sible through the complete consolida
tion of some of these chinches or
through such federation as shall pre
serve the identity of the various bodies
entering into It, and shall also provide
for effective administrative co-opera
tion." . 4>;V
NEW YORK, Dec. 10.â A step toward
the suggested union of various Presby
terian churches in the United States
was taken here to-day at a Joint meet-
Ing of committees from the governing
bodies of four such denominational or
ganizations, a set of resolu'.ions de
claring such a union desirable being
adopted. One resolution says:
PARIS, Dec. 10.â In order to save. the
industry from ruin, a conference of
owners of sailing vessels began a dis
cussion here to-day of the measures
to remedy the situation. Representa
tives of the United States, Great Brit
ain, France, Germany and other na
tions participated. Two important
proposals were under discussion â one
being a limitation of the number of
sailing ships and the other uniform
rates, based; on the Liverpool confer
ence of November 4. The. British rep
resentatives suggested the appoint
ment, of brokers by v each country to
look after freights for the ships of
their respective countries."
The conference was the result of the
general decllrte in freights, especially
between, Europe and the Pacific Coast
of the United States, which have fallen
off one-half. It is hoped that the-re
sult of the conference will be to abolish
competition.

* NEW YORK, Dec. 10â The *iock market
Tr.z.&* another struggle to-day against the

cumbed and yielded to a lower level. Net de

much of thiÂ» selling was attributed to Puts

unfavorable. e*lng to the continued accumu

taid to apply to Southern furnacta aa well as
to the Northern. The exjsfnc* of a better

As a result of the vaulting ambition
of a mule to kick a locomotive off the
track, P. F. Walther and the Sierra
Railway Company became entangled"
in a lengthy and expensive bit of lit
igation, which was ended by the Su
preme Court yesterday. It appears
from the evidence that the enjeine
knocked out its opponent i,n a single
round.
The law says that a railway com
pany is responsible for animals killed
by its trains provided that the track
runs beside or through the land of the
owners of the beasts. Walther, in the
phraseology of the court, was the
â¢â¢licensee of the tenant of the owner
of the land" beside which the mule
in question met an untimely end.
The railway companj* contended
that it was not liable for the sudden
demise of the kicker because Walther
was not the owner of the land. The
court says that he possessed all the
property rights necessary to secure
damages for the death of his mule.
The Sierra Railway Company will
have to pay for the mule, although the
amount may have to be determined by
further litigation.,

CHICAGO. Dec. 10.â Small holders war* in
clined to dispose of their wheat at the start
to-day under the Influence of the weakness
which developed late yesterday and the apathy
of the foreign markets. Afi a result an easier

feature of the early trading waa the pressure
to sell December and before It xras in
eufflclent quantities to Hop Its decline a loss
of over 2 cents had been registered. Com
mission house* with St. Ixmis connections

The weakness Jn the current month' acted as
a drag on the May option and before any con
siderable tuppsrt developed the prices of May
had declined to MMic, a loss of 1U<? from tfce
high flsure. Local longs were free, Hellers and
rua.ny stop low orders were reached on the way
down, which added Impetus to the downward
trend. Weakness in outside markets also In
creased the t-elllng pressure. Confirmation p?
reports cf rains in Argentina brought put buy
ing orders by commission housea latÂ« In' the
day and the market responded to the impTovc"<J
demand, much of the early loss being regained.
The close was steady, with May %Â§^c lower

Embezzled Money.
Edward Morgan Herrera, formerly a
clerk in the governmental paymaster's
office at Valparaiso, Chile, was arrested
yesterday by Police Detective Cody and
turned over to the Federal authorities
on the request of the Consul for Chile.
Herrera is charged with having embez

prisoner admitted his . guilt and ex
pressed his willingness to be taken back
to Valparaiso for trial. First Assistant
United States District Attorney Ban
ning filed a complaint against Herrera
for extradition.
There is no extradition treaty be
tween Chile and the United States,
but refugees from each country are ex
tradited as a matter of international

not make a fight in the courts. Her
rera has spent almost all the money
he stole in Valparaiso, and says he has
no further use for residence in the

E. Lanel of Paris, who has been ap

official comes direct from Paris, where
for a number of years he has been

Consul General Lanel is compara
tively a young man, but familiar with

receiving the support of the entire
local French colony in the administra
tion of the affairs of his office. Short
ly after his arrival last evening he
started out with a friend to see the

get acquainted with his new surround

v "It is a trifle too early for me to
make any statement regarding my fu
ture policy in this city," said' he in re

Illegality of Emergency Tax.
City Attorney Lane yesterday ad
vised the Board of Supervisors that
it will be unwise to accept the deter
mination of the Superior Court that
the so-called emergency tax for new
schoolhouses and hospital is invalid
until such time as the bonds recently
voted for the some improvements
have been sold and money obtained
with which the work contemplated
can be done.
The Goverwjr of the State of Califor
nia and the Mayor of San Francisco
are embroiled. Governor Pardee claims
the appointing power to name the suc
cessor to Percy V. Long, who was re
cently elected City Attorney in place of
Justice of the Peace, which he now fills.
Both dignitaries are striving for the
appointment, and each Is uncertain of
his ground. .Under a recent decision
of the Supreme Court it appears that
the -county of Stin Francisco has en
tirely lost its identity in the city of San
Francisco. This gives the Mayor the
power of appointment, but there are
several aspirants -who say that previous
decisions of the Supreme Court will
bear them out- in the claim that the
Governor has power to- appoint in this
case.
Governor Pardee's attorneys were not
ready to render & decision yesterday.
Abe Ruef, in the absence of the Mayor,
Â¦who went to Stockton last evening,
thought, that Mayor Schmitz had "the
appointing power for^the new Justice
of the Peace. ; .
The appointment is much sought for
and "is regarded as a political plum.
Whether Mayor or Governor shall hand
it out is a matter of moment to politi
cians.
Miss Anna Gorman, soubrette and
witness for the defense in the divorce
suit of Maude Amber against Puerl
Wilkerson, now on trial before Supe
rior Judge Murasky, refused to testify
yesterday until she received the 52
due her as witness fees. Attorney New
brough, representing Wilkerson, was
put in a condition of temporary finan
cial embarrassment. He reached into
his pocket and besides his keys
brought up only 90 cents. Another
reach brought only a knife. Miss
Gorman shook her head and kept her
lips shut. Newbrough borrowed $1 10
from a friend, gave the young woman
the $2, and the case proceeded.
Judge Murasky's courtroom re
sembled a matinee performance when
the theatrical bunch lined up to par
ticipate in Miss Amber's divorce suit.
There was a soubrette on the stand, a
collection of them under Miss Amber's
wing, and only a few feet away, in
the front chairs of the courtroom, the
baldheaded fraternity stood out in
bold contrast to ' the dreamy-eyed
sweet things with the picture bonnets.
Every one expected that something
sensational was about to occur
in the chamber of justice, but they
waited and waited in vain for the
startling thing that didn't make an
entrance.
During the day two chorus girls and
Miss Amber mounted the stand and
the deposition of Samuel Davies, a
Seattle landlord, was taken, but there
was no sensational testimony. Attor
ney Newbrough, acting for Wilkerson,
asked for a nonsuit, but Judge Mu
rasky overruled the motion.
WORE PIXK PAJAMAS.
Mrs. Ovita Hawes, the star of Wed
nesday's proceedings, was hurried to
the stand as soon as court "opened. On
cross-examination by Newbrough she
related some stories that were very
much the same as the ones she told on
the previous day about the conduct of
Wilkerson and Miss Myrtle Rosedale.
In addition, she told of calling at the
apartments of Miss Rosedale in a Ma
son street hotel and finding Wilker
son there.
The girl, according to Mrs. Hawes,
was attired in pink pajamas and
looked "too sweet." The pair re
ceived Mrs. Hawes cordially and she
stated that Wilkerson asked her not
to tell his wife about the incident,
adding, "I have always been a good
friend of yours."
Next the deposition of Davles was
taken. He swore that the three mem
bers of the "Fiddle Dee Dee" company.
Mrs. Hawes, Miss Rosedale and Miss
Gorman, occupied apartments at his
place on Third avenue, and that he had
often seen Miss Rosedale entering tÂ»nd
leaving Wilkerson's room in negligee
attire. .
Maude Amber Wilkerson was then
put on the stand. She swore that she
had heard lumors of her husband's
misconduct fully a year ago, but she
had no proof of their truth till last
summer, when, she said, she was re
liably informed concerning it.
MISS GORMAN IS WISE.
Then Miss Anna Gorman swished up
to the important seat far the defense.
She is a winsome mite, but confident
and not afraid to speak her mind.
As soon as she was sworn the young
woman informed Attorney Newbrough
that a little coin would please her.
"Two for me, please; I always get my
witness fees in advance," quoth she.
Newbrough went through his pockets,
but he only had 90 cents. He hastily
surveyed the ground and finally nego
tiated the amount, and the trial went
on.
Miss Gorman contradicted everything
that Mrs. Hawes had said on the pre
vious day. According to the shrewd
little soubrette, Wilkerson had always
acted in a proper manner toward Miss
Rosedale and the other girls of the
company, and never once did Miss
Rosedale leave her apartments during
the many nights they spent on the road
in the Northwest.
Attorneys Humphreys for the plain
tiff and Xewbrough for the defendant
occupied much time in legal tilts dur
ing "the afternoon session. The trial
will be resumed on Saturday morning
at 9:30 o'clock.
The many accusations that have been
hurled against Captain John F. Mad
den by his wife, Mrs. Edith Partello
Madden, against whom he brought suit
for divorce some time ago, have at last
caused him to break the gallant silence
he has maintained since the filing of
his original complaint Yesterday he
filed an amended complaint that direct
ly charges the fair defendant with In
fidelity and for the first time the name
of Lieutenant Hector A. Robichon, who
was court-martialed for his alleged
misconduct with Mrs. Madden, has been
connected with the Superior Court end
of the case.
Attorney Charles K. Moser filed the
amended complaint in which the young
army officer is named as the man who
caused the rift in the matrimonial hap
piness of the Maddens, and the man
upon whom Mrs. Madden has said to
have lavished a large part of her af
fections during the absence of her hus
band in the Philippines.
The amended complaint contains the
allegations that Mrs. Madden was too
friendly with Robichon at the Benicia
Barracks and that he was visited by
the pretty defendant while he occupied
quarters at the United States General
Hospital at the Presidio. It is also
alleged that she spent a great deal of
time in his company in this city and
other parts of the State. From July
1, 1902, to July 1 of this year it Is al
leged Mrs. Madden gave freely of her
love to the dashing infantryman.
OTHER MEX FAVORED.
Robichon, according to the amended
complaint, is not the only one who has
enjoyed Mrs. Madden's favors since her
marriage to Madden at FortMcPher
son, Ga. "Other men, whose names are
unknown to the plaintiff," are alleged
to have been established in her good
graces.
In this new document Madden also
asks to be awarded the custody of the
child born to them a little more than
a year ago. The little one is now un
der the care and control of Madden's
parents.
W. A. Samuel, butcher, wants a di
vorce from Catherine Samuel on the
ground of cruelty. He says that for
years he has been a much-abused man,
and that for many months his wife
would speak to him only when she
wanted money. He accuses her also
of taking the savings" of years and
denying him a share in them. She con
tracted debts," he says, refused to pay
them out of the Income from their
community property and finally caused
his butcher shop to be attached. .He
also charges that one night a short
time^ago he came home'with his brother
and his wife refused to give him any
thing to eat but tea and bread and that
she gave to his brother large portions
of. cold ham and numerous delicacies.
The Samuels were married twenty
three years ago and have four chil
dren, only one of whom, however, is
under age.
MORE WARRING COUPLES.
Mildred M. Gardner is seeking a di
vorce from John R. Gardner - of 933
Eddy street on the grounds of cruelty
and neglect. She says that though he
has an income of $220 a month he has
not provided for her since last June,
when, without giving her any explana
tion, he packed up his wearing apparel
and left her. She further charges that
almost continuously since their mar
riage in July, 188^, he has used vile
language toward her and that once, in
the year 1899, in the presence of her
mother, he struck her.
Suits for divorce were also filed by
Josephine H. Adams against Joseph H.
Adams for neglect, Gustave Lindee
against Nita Stone Lindee for deser
tion and Olivet" Blote against Frederick
Blote for neglect.
Interlocutory decrees of divorce were
granted to Kstella Fitzgerald from W.
H. Fitzgerald for cruelty and Fannie
Forsen from Ferdinand Forsen for
cruelty.
'. A temporary injunction was secured
yesterday from Superior Judge Muras
ky restraining the Board of State Har
bor Commissioners from carrying into
effect the decision and order made on
December 3, by which the permits of
L. Scater.a & Co., Wolf &Â¦ Sons, Wet
more Bros, ar.d McDonough & Runyon
to sell perishable products on the.
State's property in this city were re
voked. Attorney J. B. Reinstein ap
peared for the firms mentioned. A part
of one complaint, the four being'iden
tical in general terms, is as follows:
That by the terms of the said application,
act and permit said permit was and is valid
for the period of ono year from and next after
said date of the issuance of said permit. That

eaid permit shall not be revoked, canceled or

cordance therewith the said plaintiff, imme
diately after the issuance and delivery thereof
as aforesaid, preceded to and did sell upon
certain portions of the property of said State,
subject to the Jurisdiction of 6aid' board, per
ishable products, and made such sales regu
larly and continuously up to and including thÂ«
