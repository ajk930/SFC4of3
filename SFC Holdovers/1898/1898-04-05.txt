WILL PRECIPITATE WAR

THE POPE HAS
OFFERED SPAIN
HIS MEDIATION.
Gladly Accepted by the Queen-
Regent, but the Newspapers
Do Not Take It So
Kindly.
Copyrighted. lSr*, by James Gordon Bennett.
MADRID. April 4.â 1 have absolute authority for saying that the Gov
ernment has accepted a proposition which is a step toward peace.
General Woodford is satisfied with Spain's reply. There was a Cab
t meeting yesterday morning, at which all the Ministers were pres
ent and the decision arrived at was to take a peaceful view. I was
; able yesterday to telegTaph you all the details of the news which
was mine, as it would not have beenallowed to pass the censor.
It was yesterday mentioned that tne Queen Regent summoned her
Ministers, Senors Sagasta, Gullon and Moret, and informed them that the
Pope had offered mediation and advised that Spain should at once grant
an armistice, as requested by the United States, thus ending the ques
tion of peace or war in favor of peace.
In the afternoon the Austrian Embassador called upon Mr. Woodford
and gave his assurances that he would guarantee that Spain would carry
out her portion of the contract, which is to do everything in her power
to restore harmony in Cuba during the time the armistice lasted.
The Spanish Government has been afraid to grant an armistice on ac
count of the army, but the Pope advises the army as a father and bids
it cease fighting.
Spain only asks one thing in return for this concession. That is, that
the United States should meet her half way by simultaneously withdraw
ing her warships in Cuban waters.
HOME, April 4.â The Vatican refuses to publish the text of the com
munications which have passed between the Pontiff and Madrid, but the
statement that his Holiness has asked Spain to arrange for a suspension
of hostilities in Cuba is confirmed.
The Osservatore Romano, reviewing the situation unofficially, says:
"We must regard America's demands as excessive, especially as Spain
has proposed to submit the whole administration question to the insular
parliament. It is difficult to perceive on what pretext Washington could
declare war, even if bo disposed; and we have confidence that the wisdom
and moderation of President McKinley, with the practical common sense
of the Americans, will avert the horrors of war."
The Italia, confirming the report as to the communications that have
passed between the Vatican and the Spanish government, says: "The
prospect that mediation will eventually be offered is not excluded, but
the greatest difficulty will be to induce the United States to accept the
Pope as arbitrator." .
MADRID, April 4.â The Liberal
'Republican) referring to the Pope's
.ntervention between Spain and Cuba
Bays that it wants the "assurance
that the Pope's mediation is not a
pretext for the United States to ob
tain a delay of some months, with
the view of recommencing later the
struggle against Spain within and
without Cuba."
The Liberal further remarks that
it does not lose sight of the fact that
the Pope's mediation tacitly admits
the American right to interfere in
Spanish affairs in the interest of
peace; and expresses the beiief that
the Government will be obliged to ds

TO HOLD SPAIN
FOR THE LOSS
OF THE MAINE
Committees of Congress Will Not
Permit the Dons to Escape
Their Responsibilty.
NEW YORK. April 4.â The Her
ald's Washington " correspondent tele
graphs: In accordance with the pro
gramme agreed upon at the conference
of the Republican members of the
House Committee on Foreign Affairs
last night and outlined exclusively in
the Herald this morning, when the com
mittee met to-day the Republicans act
ed as a unit and adjourned. The com
mittee is to meet at 10 o'clock on Wed
nesday morning unless called together
to-morrow by Mr. Adams, acting chair
man. Mr. Adams told the Democrats
that the President's message most cer
tainly would be in on Wednesday, and
perhaps to-morrow. He declined to
give the Democrats definite information
as to the character of the message.
The Democratic members appreciat
ed the fact that time was required to
prepare the message and promised to
counsel patience on their side of the
House. This promise was afterward
fulfilled by Representative Williams of
Mississippi, who, when Mr. Bailey was
endeavoring to make trouble for the
Republicans in the House, said that dis
closures had been made in the commit
tee which sealed the lips of the Repub
licans and Democrats alike.
A general understanding is being ar
rived at as to the outlines of the action
which shall be taken when the commit
tee acts on Wednesday. The destruc
tion of the Maine will be in no way
subordinated to the general situation in
Cuba. On the contrary, it is the pres
ent disposition of the majority of the
committee to make the destruction of
the Maine and the slaughter of her of
ficers and men the prominent grounds
for action, and to subordinate to some
extent at least the Cuban situation.
Some of the members of the com
mittee would go so far as to leave
out altogether any recognition of the
independence of Cuba, and take action
looking to the expulsion of Spain
from Cuba and Porto Rico and the
lowering of the Spanish flag for all
time upon the Western Hemisphere.
The present indications ar-j that the
Senate and House Committee will act
along the same lines. There have been
conferences between the leading mem
bers of the committees and it is quite
probable the resolution which will be
reported to the Senate and House will
be identical in language.
The resolution proposed by Senator
Foraker will probably be made the
basis of action so far as it relates to
Maria Theresa.
WOODFORD TO
BE WITHDRAWN.
NEW YORK, April 4.â The
Herald's Washington correspon
dent sends the following: In an
ticipation of the President's mes
sage making diplomatic relations
with Spain no longer possible, all
arrangements, as previously
stated to the Herald, have been
made for the withdrawal of our
representatives in Spain and
Cuba. Our interests will be
turned over to the British rep
resentatives.
The formal withdrawal of Min
ister Woodford will probably
come simultaneously with the
transmission of the President's
message. The message will make
such a vigorous arraignment of
Spain that it will be impossible
to expect a continuance of diplo
matic relations with that coun
try even though some time may
elapse before a formal declara
tion of war from either side.
As to the result of the Presi
dent's firm message, it means
nothing short of forcible inter
vention. War is considered in
evitable by those familiar with
its contents.
the recognition of Cuba and interven
tion. The resolution finally reported,
however, will, as stated above, bring
the Maine affair to the front in the
strongest light.
The report of the Court of Inquiry
showing, as it does, beyond doubt
that the Maine, after having been
moored by the Spanish Harbor Mas
ter at a buoy where no ship had been
placed for a long time, was blown up
by a submarine mine, has convinced
the members of the committee that
Spain's responsibility for this act
was so direct as to make it virtually
n hostile act, and one with which
there seems to be no way of dealing
except by war.
No monetary indemnity would satisfy
Congress for the loss of the Maine, and
the members believe the only way sat
isfaction can be obtained for this affair
is by compelling the withdrawal of
Spain from the western hemisphere.
The Senate Committee on Foreisn
Relations resumed its sittings to-day,

Mediation Finds Little
Favor,
NEW YORK, April 4.â A Washington special to
tlie Herald says : Senators Elkins, Hanna, Spooner.
Fairbanks, Platt of New York and Hoar of Massachusetts,
who are unquestionably familiar with the views of the
President, to-day assured their colleagues and others
with whom they discussed the subject that the President
has finally decided that the time has come for action, and
unless some unlooked-for change in the situation occurs
before Wednesday morning he will send a ringing mes
sage to Congress and the country which will merit the
approval of every lover of Old Glory.
Senator Elkins says if all efforts for a peaceful solu
tion of the problem fail we might as well prepare for a
long and expensive war, and not stop at the independence
of Cuba but carry the war on until we subdue Spain
entirely and dispossess her of all her property on the
Western Hemisphere and also of the PhilippineÂ«lslands.
Senator Lodge, who is in frequent consultation with
the President and Judge Day, and at the same time an
ardent advocate of free Cuba, says he is now convinced
that the President will send a message to Congress which
will meet the approval of the most enthusiastic patriots
and will be positive notice to Spain that Cuban inde
pendence must be granted, even if force has to be resorted
to. Seuator Lodge says he does not believe the United
States will sanction the reported mediation of the Roman
church between the United States and Spain. He says
the United States is prepared to do its own mediating,
and any attempt on the part of the Catholic church to
interfere at this juncture will be resented in every section
of the country.
NEW YORK, April 4.â The Her
ald's Washington correspondent tele
graphs: President McKinley has com
pleted his Cuban message, and, as ex
clusively stated in the Herald on last
Sunday, it will be sent to Congress at
noon on Wednesday.
It will be a vigorous arraignment
of Spain.
By implication it will show that the
time has come when it is the duty of
the United tstates to intervene and
end the war in Cuba.
It will leave Congress untrammeled
in the character of the action that
should be taken.
It will be a message that may not
please the extremists, nor will it meet
the views of the peace at any price
people. That it is strong and vigorous
.is perhaps best indicated by the fact that
two members of the Cabinet, who are
favorable to peace, object to some of
the sentiments which have been incor
porated in it by the chief executive.
The message is very long. It con
tains a recital of the events which have
made Cuba a desert, speaks of the ter
rible condition of the reconcentrados, of
the destruction done property, and de
clares that Spain is unable to suppress
the insurgents.
The facts which the President will
set forth will impress Congress, ad
ministration officials believe, with
the necessity of action.
Besides describing the present condi
tions existing in Cuba and reciting the
facts leading up to this condition, the
President will refer to the negotiations
which have been conducted in the past
with Spain, and will show that the Mad
rid Government has given the United
States the right to interfere in matters
concerning Cuba. He will give a state
ment of the demands he has made upon
Spain looking to the ending of the war
and the reply which he received from
the Sagasta Ministry.
To the Maine incident the Presi
dent will devote the feeling feature
of his document.
He will speak of the finding of the
American Court of Inquiry, reiterate
his action in forwarding the report to
Spain and state the answer made there

IRELAND
DEPRECATES
INTERVENTION.
LONDON, April s.â The Rome
correspondent of the Daily Mail
says: Archbishop Ireland has
cabled, deprecating a formal
offer of intervention and explain
ing that the Pope could only in
tervene successfully by recogniz
ing the Monroe doctrine, which
would be impolitic.
A rumor is current here that
Emperor William first broached
the idea of papal mediation, and
was warmly seconded by Aus
tria,
The solution the Vatican pro
poses is an armistice to save
Spanish troops during the rainy
season, allay excitement on both
sides and prepare the way for
Cuban independence in the au
tumn. Spain is agreeable to this,
but there is little hope that the
Cuban insurgents or their Ameri
can sympathizers will accede to
the proposal.
to, but the only comment which he will
make in connection with this matter will
be that it is horrible to think that a
man-of-war, on a peaceful mission to a
port of a friendly nation, should be de
stroyed by a submarine mine- of such
enormous power as that which blew up
the Maine.
He will point out this horrible in
cident as one of the most important
links in the chain of evidence which
establishes Spain's inability either to
protect the vessels of friendly pow
ers at anchor in her harbors or to
control the internal affairs of tho is
land of Cuba.
To Congress will be left the responsi
bility of action. The President will not
urge the recognition of the independ
ence of Cuba, nor will he formally re
commend intervention. But the facts
which he gives and which are given in
all their awful coloring are so presented2
MORE CASH FOR

McKJnley Attaches His Signature

NEW YORK, April 4.â A Washington special to the Herald says:
To further Increase emergency supplies of ordnance and ammunition
for the vs'ar Department the President applied his signature to-day to
another $1,000,000 allotment which will be expended under the direction
of Brigadier-General Flagler, Chief of Ordnance. This money will be

THE REVOLUTION OF 1688.
February 12 is the memorable anni
versary of the perfecting of the revo
lution of 1688. James II having with
his family withdrawn in terror to
Frai invention called by the
Prli 'range met on January 22,
nd preceded under his protec
tion to deliberate on the settlement of
the kingdom. To find that James had
abdicated was an easy matter; how to
dispose of the vacant throne was not
bo easy. There was a large party for a
regency; others wore disposed to ac
cept the Princess of Orange, the eldest
daughter of the as their sov
ereign. It was not till after much de
bating and a threat of the Prince to
go b'tck to Holland anil leave them to
settle their own affairs that the con
vention at length on February 12
adopted the resolution: "That William
and Mary, Prince and Princess of Or
ange, be declared King and Queen of
England, Prance and Ireland, and the
dominions thereunto belonging." Th*>
CVOWH was next day offered to them In
, the banqueting-room at Whitehall and
accepted, and the revolution was com
plete. Mary had arrived in London so
recently as the 11th, by which time It
was tolerably certain that she and her
husband were to be nominated toajoint
sovereignty.
However glad she might be at her
husband's Fuecessful expedition, how
ever excited by the prospect of being
a Regent Queen of England, the cr'sis
was one calculated to awaken softer
feelings. She was displacing a father;
her husband was extruding un uncle.
"It was believed," says Evelyn, "that
both, especially the Princess, would
have showed some seeming reluctance
of assuming her father's crown, and
made some apology, testifying by her
ret that he should by his misman
agement necessitate the nation to so
raordinary a proceeding; which
would have shown very handsomely to
the world. Nothing of all this ap
pr-ared. Phe came into Whitehall,
'aughing and jolly, as to wedding,
so as to seem quite transported. She
rose early the next morning, and in
her undress, as was reported,
before her women were up, went about
â¢ from room to room to see the conven
ience of Whitehall; lay in the same bed
where the late Queen lay; and, within
a night or two, sat down to play at
basset, as the Queen, her predecessor,
used to do. She smiled upon and talk
ed to everybody. inls carriage was
< -nsured by many." It now appears
t Mary acted under orders from her
1 usband, who wished to give a check
lo those who desired to see his wife
made sole monarch and deemed her ill
used because he was associated with
her. Lord Macaulay even makes It
out to be a fine case of self-devotion on
the part of the Queen.âSpare Mo

CHARTER CLUB
LABOR'S FRIEND
Its Success Would Ben
efit Working Classes
of San Jose.
-
Election of Honest Men Certain
to Result in Decreased
Taxes.
Silly Claim of the "Gang" That It
Seeks to Aid the City's
Toilers.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, April One of the spe
cious and false arguments made by
the "gang" and its organ in support of
the "gang" ticket Is that, under the ex
travagant regime of the corruptionists,
work has been provided for laboring
men. The election of the Rea ticket,
which masquerades under the title of
the People's Municipal Ticket, it is
claimed, will mean a continuance of
employment for working men.
In all these arguments great care is
taken to avoid all mention of the fact
that in nearly all cases where men
have been employed on work for the
city they have had to pay for their job,
wait indefinitely for their pay, or dis
count their warrants. It has very sel
dom happened that there was money in
the treasury to pay them at the time
when they completed their work. Nor
has any mention ever been made by
the "gang" supporters of the fact that
the work obtained from the city was
intermittent and of comparatively short
duration. These are facts and circum
stances that every workingman living
in San Jose knows, and they should be
thoroughly considered by workingmen
when they go to the polls on April 11.
On the other hand they should also
consider what will be the result, so far
as they are concerned, should the New
Charter Club ticket be elected, and good
and economical government thereby
be established in the city of San Jose.
With changed conditions in the mat
ter of taxation, and in the administra
tion of the city's affairs on business
principles, would come improved con
ditions for every individual living in
San Jose, and the workingman would
not be the least affected. Lower taxes,
intelligent public improvements and all
those things that go to make up pro
gressive municipal government will
draw capital to San Jose, will give an
impetus to existing enterprises, will en
courage the establishment of new in
dustries, will enhance the value of
property, and employment will be pro
vided for every industrious and compe
tent man the year round and at good
wages.
The workingmen of San Jose are
among the most intelligent within the
State, and with these contrasting pic
tures of what may be expected from
the election of the candidates on one or
the other ticket now in the field placed
before them, it is not likely that they
will cast their vote for men who are
opposed to their best interests. They
will perceive that only in the election
of the entire New Charter Club ticket
can they look forward to steady em
ployment at good wages.
Boss Rea has now got down to doing
street-corner olitlcs. He does not
disdain to stand on the curb and at
tempt to delude the passing voter. One
of his favorite tricks is to - take the
ticket of the New Charter Club and
feign to analyze it. Rea knows the
political faith of nearly every. voter in
town. In talking to a Republican he
analyzes the Good Government ticket,
to which he is opposed, so as to make
it appear to be composed of nearly all
Democrats. A contrary showing is
made. when he buttonholes a Democrat.
Pursuing his customary campaign
work, Rea has slated for the knife six
members of the appointing board on
the ticket which he caused to be put in
the field. Fourteen members are to be
voted for, but eight constitute a ma
jority, and the majority has the power
to make all appointments on the five
boards that the appointing, board is to
create. By "single-shotting" eight men
Rea hopes he may be able to pet a ma
jority of the board who will do his
bidding without question.
The eight men by whom Rea Intends
to stand are the following: P. P. Aus
tin, A. G. Bennett, H. Booksin Sr.,
Rush McComas, J. K. Secord, Francis
K. Spenoer; Frank ''tock and v: CD.
Wright. Those who are to be slaugh
tered are the following: . Milton Camp
bell, E. E. Chase. Al G. Col, H. J,
Fiken, D. Hatman and John Leffier.

MERCED, April 4.â Deputy Sheriff
Sam Dickinson at La Grande was noti
fied this morning that the Cross Creek
train robbers were seen late on Satur
day night near Ben Hur, a small vil
lage near Pea Ridge Postofflce in Ma
dera County. They called at a miner's
cabin and begged food. Only one of
the men entered the house. The other
remained out in the darkness while the
miner prepared some bacon and beans
for the famished pair. They ate the
meal outside and disappeared as soon
as they had finished. The miner saw
only the one person who applied for
the food, the other man remaining out
side all the time.
The point where the bandits were
seen is on a direct line from Indian
Gulch to the Fresno "Flats, where Re
gan has many friends and relatives.
As scon as Dickinson received the
news he sent word to his bandit-hunt
ing companion, George Youkum, to
Join him, and late this afternoon they
started for the place, where the rob
bers were seen, to take up the chase.
The robbers are traveling at a rate of
about ten miles a day, and it is thought
that they cover most of the distance
at night. They are going In almost a
direct line south and keeping well up
in the foothills. Most of the officers
who were in pursuit have returned,
and when the news came from Een
Hur yesterday there were, no officers
in that vicinity.
The Sheriffs of the valley counties
are holding themselves in readiness to
take to the mountains in pursuit at a
moment's notice, expecting almost
every day to receive word that the
robbers have been corraled and that
assistance is needed to force them to
surrender.
The hunt has become a waiting one.
All the friends of Regan in Fresno
Flats have been warned not to harbor
him, and Inducements are being held
out to them to notify the officers the
moment the fugitives have settled in
pny place in the vicinity where they
might think themselves free from pur

of the Maine disaster.
The committee has accepted the
finding of the Court of Inquiry, so
far as it goes, but they have exer
cised their prerogative of extending
the inquiry and of drawing conclu
sions in advance of those drawn by
the Maine court.
This report will be in the nature of an
address to the country, in justification of
the resolutions to be reported by the
committee, and as it will be ~ut in the
terse and yet fervid style of Senator Da
vis, it is expected by Cuban sympathiz
ers in the Senate that it will have a
strong effect.
The committee now expects to be able
to report on the same day the Presi
dent's message is received, and mem
bers of the committee still look for a
message that will be in perfect accord
with their resolution and a declaration
favorable to intervention. If this should
prove to be the case they will be pre
pared to report forthwith.
The President has been informed of
the probable character of the commit
tee report, but what, if any, comment he
has made has not been public. Senator
Davis, chairman of the committee, ex
pressed the opinion that the message
of the President would be received to
morrow, but he said he had no author
itative information on this point and
it might be delayed until Wednesday.
Bam Katahdin Ordered to Sea.
PHILADELPHIA, April 4.â Orders

LONDON, April 4.â The United States
officials here have been reticent concern
ing thn najne to be borne by the Ameri
can cruiser purchased last Saturday from
the Thames Iron Works. She now bears
the unique name Diogenes, but the Gov
ernment will undoubtedly change It. A
large force was at work all day and into
the night coaling and provisioning her,
and it is expected that the work will be
completed to-morrow.
San Diego's Normal School.
SACRAMENTO, April 4.â The State
Board of Capitol Commissioners met to
day and deferred consideration of the
plans for the State normal school at San
Diego, on account of a long prou-^t which
they wish to examine. State Treasurer
Rackliffe asked the Governor what course
to pursue, and was told that he could buy
the books In stock. If he could find them,
and that a man from San Francisco
would probably soon call at hte office to
examine hla books, and he would soon
thereafter be Informed that they were In
Btock. The books will cost over $400.
FOR TEMPORARY
FORTIFICATIONS
Passage of a Significant
Bill in the House of
Representatives.
Bailey of Texas Demurs in
Vain, but Secures Applause
Frcm the Galleries.
However, the Democratic Leader
Admits That Uncle Sam Should
Prepare lor War.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs Houpse,
Washington, April 4. .
While there was no attempt to force i
consideration of a resolution regarding
the Cuban situation in the House, there
was a brief outbreak, in the course of
which the warlike temper of the crowd
ed galleries was so manifest ' that
Speaker Reed threatened to clear them |
if it was repeated. The outbreak oc- !
curred over a bill to authorize the Pres- i
ident to erect temporary fortifications
in case of emergency upon land when
the written consent of the owners was
obtained, without awaiting the long
process of " legislative â  consideration.
This led to a demand by Bailey, the j
Democratic leader, for information as ;
to the facts which warranted all these
war measures. The particular state
ment which aroused the galleries was
to the effect that while the Democrats i
were willing to wait any reasonable :
time for the President to transmit a
message that would meet the approval !
of the American people, they would
not wait a minute for him to continue 'â 
negotiations with the butchers of I
Spain. When the demonstration in the
galleries was rebuked by the Speaker i
.Bailey said that the galleries were the
American people in miniature. Cannon
accused Bailey of "posturing" and
playing to the galleries.' The bill was
passed and it was arranged that the
army reorganization bill should ,; be
taken up on Wednesday, unless a re- â ,
port was made from the ConinJttee on
Foreign Affairs.
Baney called attention to the fact j
that on several occasions within the i
last thirty days the House had been
called upon to vote upon several prop
ositions which indicated that war was ;
directly ahead of us. Yet, he said.
Congress^ was not in possession of any
fact which warranted this belief. He
had voted, he said, for the extra- i
ordinary $50,000,000 appropriation, but
he had voted for it under the impres
sion that we were perilously near to
war. If a Democratic President had
asked a Democratic House to author
ize such an expenditure without con- i
trol or limitation, he should have de
nied it. He should have demanded the .
estimates. But in this case, believing I
that danger was near at hand, he had
voted for it. Much of the vast appro
priation had already been expended,
yet information except such as came
through newspapers was withheld. To- I
< day the House was asked to meet an- j
| other emergency. Last Wednesday, j
when the House wAs asked to meet the !
vital question, the majority had re- ;
j fused to meet it. ; It was then every
i where announced that the President
would be prepared to send a message
to Congress to-day. The House ad
journed Friday until to-day with that
impression. Yet. now every well-in
formed man knew there was none to
i day. When was the message to come
in, he asked.
"It seems to me important," said he,
"that the House and the country
should know what' the Government
is doing Â and intends to do. We
ought not to be asked to vote blindly.
If the occasion warrants it, we are
j ready to vote for every proper
j measure to prepare for war, and if war
comes we are ready to vote for every
measure designed to prosecute it to a
successful conclusion."
A perfect storm of applause swept
the galleries, which the Speaker had
considerable difficulty in subduine.
The Speaker warned the galleries that
no demonstration of approval or dis
approval would be permitted. But
the next utterance of Bailey redoubled
the applause.
"Those galleries," said Bailey, wav
ing his hands above the thronged gal
leries, "are but a miniature of the
American people. If Congress could
face the galleries of the people they
would force thi3 nouse to action."
This time the Speaker sternly warned
the galleries that if the demonstration
was repeated he would order them
cleared.
"Oh, I think that would hardly be
fair," interposed Steele (R.) of Indiana.
"The gentleman is only talking to tha
galleries." [Laughter.]
Maguire of California: "Mr. Speaker,
The gentleman from Illinois (Cannon)
stated that the pending measure is not
intended to meet a present emergency
and that its efrect is not confined to
times of actual war. It makes a per
manent change in the law, giving un
usual power to the President of the
United States to put the country on a
war footing at his discretion. It seems
to me that we have gone far enough in
that direction. We have gone far
enough toward abdicating the consti
tutional power of Congress to declare
war, to provide for the common de
fense and to regulate the land and
naval forces of the United States. I am
willing to vote for a resolution putting
such power in the hands of tl ! chief
executive temporarily in time of war,
but I insist that such extraordinary
power should be confined to times of
actual warfare. My understanding of
the existing law is that the President
now has this very power in times of
war, so that the purpose of the resolu
tion is taking advantage of the present
war scare to clothe him with this im
portant power in times of peace. To
this I am opposed. It is simply an
other step in the scheme of centraliza
tion which this emergency is being used
to promote."
After some further debate, the bill
was passed.
NUTRIENTS IN MALT LTQTJORS.
Wine? and malt liquors, while contain
ing a far less amount of alcohol than the
distilled liquors, do contain a definite
amount of nutritive material. Perhaps
the best definition of beer as brewed to
day is that of a fermented saccharine in
fusion to which had been added a whole
some bitter. It consists of water, alco
hol, carbonic and acetic acids, and bitter
principles from the hop. According to
Professor Atwater's Investigations, "Ale,
beer and wine contain small quantities
of nutritive material in addition to their
alcohol and other constituents. That of
wine consists mainly of compounds akin
to carbohydrates, and averages a trifle
over 3 per cent of the whole weight. That
of ale and beer Includes, on the average,
a little over one^half of 1 per cent of
protein and other nitrogenous compounds
and 6 or 7 per cent of carbohydrates and
allied' substances. A pint (pound) of ale
or beer would contain, roughly speaking,
about as much of these nutritive sub
stances as one and one-fifth ounces of
bread; and a pint of wine about as much
as three-quarters of an ounce of bread."â

McKinley's Message to
Be a Most Vigorous
Document.
Will Show That It Is Time for
Armed Intervention in Be
half of the Cubans.
Hostilities Can Now Only Be Avoided
by the Madrid Government
Yielding Every Point.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riges House,
.Washington, April 5.
The Washington Post says that unless
Spain, within forty-eifrht hours, yields
all by surrendering Cuba, war cannot
be averted. It sums up the situation as
follows:
"President McKinley's message to
Congress will be a ringing, vigorous
document that promises to meet the
full expectation of Congress and the
people. It will be a scathing arraign
ment of Spain, showing that she has
demonstrated her utter incapacity to
govern; that her colonies have declined
in population, as the result of misrule
and oppression; that American com
merce has ben damaged and American
lives and property imperiled, and that
existing conditions should not and will
not be tolerated by this Government.
The destruction nf the battle-ship
Maine and the slaughter of 266 officers
and seamen serving under the United
States flag will be commented upon in
strong language and Spain will be held
responsible for that disaster.
"The President will make no direct
recommendation, but his message will
point clearly to the necessity of armed
intervention to restore order and peace.
He will not recommend the recognition
of the independence of the island be
cause the insurgents have no estab
lished form of Government and the
President and Cabinet believe that a
travesty would be presented to the
world if, following the recognition of
independence, the United States should
as the result of war take that inde
pendence away by seizing or annexing
the island.
"The President's message will be
equivalent to a declaration of war and
hostilities can now only be averted by
Spain yielding all.
"Pope Leo XIII is mediating between
Spain and Cuba. The efforts of his
Holiness have already resulted in an
appeal from Spain to the insurgents,
through the autonomic Cabinet for an
armistice, pending an agreement for
peace and independence. It is learned
that his Holiness has represented to
Spain that it is the part of wisdom to
make every possible concession, even
to surrendering the island absolutely,
rather than go to war with the United
States which would inevitably result in
the loss of Cuba and other Spanish col
onies, and at the same time endanger
tho dynasty. The United States has
ceased all negotiations and will not ac
cept mediation. The administration
and Congress see no alternative but
war." â¢
THE "FLOWERY LAND" MUTINY.
On February 14, 1864, seven men were
tried at the Central Criminal Court in
London, before Baron Bramwell, for
murder committed on September 10,
1563, in the English ship Flowery Land,
which had left London on July 28 previ
ous for Singapore, in the Straits of Ma
lacca, with a cargo of wine and other
commodities, and twenty persons on
board, including a crew of nineteen and
one passenger. The mutineers, as usu
al in such cases seem to have been all
foreigners, and chiefly of Southern Eu
rope â four Spaniards, one Greek, one
Turk and another, who, although his
name was John Lyons, could speak
English but fairly. Earlier symptoms
of insubordinatic-n had been tempora
rily suppressed by punishment; but on
this day, when the captain was below,
they struck down the mate with hand
spikes, obliterated with their weapons
every feature of his head and face, and
then threw him, shrieking, into the
sea. The captain, apparently alarmed
by the disturbance, and coming up
from his cabin, was dispatched with
daggers. His brother, trying to escape
by the companion ladder, was attacked
and beaten about the head till he died,
and his body, it is presumed, was
thrown into the sea. The ruffians
would have treated the captain's body
in the same way, but Tiffin, the second
mate, persuaded them to allow him to
sew it up in canvas, and to commit it
to the deep with some religious rites.
The mutineers next collected and di
vided, the plunder on board. Tiffin
alone knew anything of navigation, and
Lyons made him understand that they
wished to run the vessel to the coast of
Brazil. After many murderous on
slaughts between those on board the
vessel, when within ten miles of land,
was scuttled by the mutineers, or, in
other words, was sunk by cutting holes
in its bottom and sides, and then, with
the exception of the rook and steward,
who were beaten to dÂ»ath with cham
pagne bottles while st'Mgglirttf in the
water, the survivors took to the small
boats with what provisions they could
stow in them. When land was reached
Tiffin managed to separate himself
from his companions, and gave infor
mation which led to the arrest of the
prisoners. The facts above mentioned
were established at the trial on his
evidence and that of others of the crew
who had seen the outrages committed.
The seven mutineers were found guilty
of murder, and were sentenced to be
executed: and on February 22, 1864, five
of them were hanged in front of New
gate in presence of an immense gath
ering of people, the sentences upon the
other two being commuted to penal
servitude for life. â English Magazine.
PARTIES IN SPAIN.
The mass of the country people, the
vast majority of the inhabitants of Spain,
would never vote at all of their own free
will. In the towns there are those who
take, as far as writing and speaking go,
a lively interest In politics, but with them
it evaporates in words. Time was when
there were two great governing forces
at work in Spain â those two great medi
eval powers which a barbarous people
can realizeâ the i^ng and the church. To
day they are not destroyed but divided
against themselves or against one an
other.
The old royalist sentiment is split be
tween the ruling dynasty and the Carl
lsts. The church sympathizes In its heart
with the lost cause. Therefore It is kept
at arm's length b the victor.
There is no governing class In
Spain. The aristocracy destroyed Its own
power centuries ago, when* it re-used to
pay taxes because It rendered military
service, and allowed itself to je extruded
from the Cortes which met to vote the
taxes. A strong ruling line might have
supplied the country with a vigorous des
potism. But the air of Spain has been
fatal to its dynasties. The Hapsburgs
ended with an idiot. The Bourbons have
sunk to cretinism.â Blackwood's Maga

REMOVES THE
YELLOW FEVER
QUARANTINE
Action Taker) at Washirjgton to
Enable Americans to Hurry
prom Cuba.
Copyrighted, IS9S. by James Gordon Bennett.
HAVANA, April 4.â General Lee to-night received a dispatch from
the State Department informing him that the quarantine against yellow
fever will be temporarily raised and that all Americans, naturalized or
native born, now in Cuba, may enter Floridan ports. In order that this
may be facilitated General Lee is to charter any merchantmen within
reach. None is now in port.
To further expedite matters, the lighthouse tenders Mangrove and
Bache will arrive to-morrow to take away all who care to go. The Mas
cotte will be here on Wednesday and will carry a very large passenger
list. The Olivette will make an extra trip, arriving and leaving on
Thursday, and already her full capacity has been taken. The coast liner
Florida leaves to-morrow, carrying about 300, w'.io are anxious to leave.
The order from the State Department to General Lee caused a great
rush to the consulate, which was kept open after hours so that health
certificates might be given to those entitled to them. The United States
has not a treaty with Spain touching naturalization, so there are per
sons who have lived in Cuba for thirty years, and just remember that
they possess American citizenship papers. Of these there are probably
from 2000 to 2500 in Havana, while the native-born Americans here
scarely number fifty.
The exodus from Havana to Florida under the new rule will prob
ably increase the Florida population by 2500 and perhaps more.
General Lee is greatly gratified at the quick response to his request
for a change in the quarantine ruling. His office has been besieged for
days by those wishing to leave, but who were kept out of Florida by
the quarantine law, which went into effect a month earlier than usual.

SACRAMENTO, April 4.â Governor
Budd to-day received the following let
ter:
Executive Committee of the
Art Building Association,
San Jose, Cal., March 31, 189&
Hon. J. U. Budd, Sacramento, Cal.â
Dear Sir: Mrs. Myles P. O'Connor of this
city proposes to give to the State Normal
School of San Jose, Cal., through the
trustees of that institution, an art col-
Jection valued at from SIUU.OOO to $200,000,
provided the citizens of San Jose will
erect a suitable building for the reception
j and permanent investment of this collec
tion. This proposition has been taken up
! by the various woman's clubs of this city,
I who are actively and earnestly engaged
in securing funds for tne erection of an
' art building, to cost from $20 .000 to $33,000.
' This money will be raised within the year
I and nominally (for the ladies wish to re
serve the right to exercise some choice as
to style and plan of building) turned over
to the Normal School Trustees for the
erection of such building, provided they
can, without conflicting with ar existing
regulation governing the case, place this
! building upon the Normal School grounds.
The executive committee can see norea
, son why this plan cannot be carried out,
and the Normal School, as well as the
city of San Jose, be enriched by the ac
quisition of this valuable educational fac
tor. We have decided to place this mat
ter before you for your consideration and
j decision at the meeting of Normal School
1 Trustees, to be held In Los Angeles April
8, IS9S.
Hoping that your honorable body may
be able to report favorably ur^on this
proposition, I am, in behalf of the com
mittee, very respectfully yours,
MRS. C. H. CLEMENT.
Trustee Halo of the San Jose Nor
mal School visited the Governor to-day
1 as a committee of one to lay the mat
i ter before him. Mr. Hale said that
the citizens had already subscribed
$5000 to the building fund, and he had
no doubt that the entire sum of $20,000
would be forthcoming provided there
would be no obstacle or objection from
the representatives of the State to the
proposition of erecting the proposed
building on State grounds.
Governor Budd assured Mr. Hale
that, so far as he was concerned, there
â would not be the slightest objection to
the proposition, and he felt sure that
no one would oppose the acceptance of
so generous a gift as the one proposed.
In speaking later to The Call corre
spondent the Governor said:
"I consider the State very lucky in
deed in having been proffered so mu
nificent a gift as the one proposed by
Mrs. O'Connor. I congratulate the
people of Pan Jose, also, upon the good
fortune which has come to them. I
have no doubt that the citizens of San
Jose will provide the necessary funds
to construct a suitable building for the
reception of this magnificent collection.
I shall give my hearty co-operation In
every way possible to further the ef
forts of the ladies who have taken hold
of this matter, and the fact that they
have taken It up. will, in my judgment,
insure Its success."
Seven Democrats Elected.

Special DlEpatch to The CaJL
SEATTLE, April 4.â The life of R. C.
Thayer, a young man who recently
; came to Seattle from Oakland, Cal., :a
hanging by a thread. I^ate this after
; noon he entered a saloon and walking
i to the lavatory drew a revolver and
! shot himself. The bullet penetrated the
' left lung and he bled profusely. He
was taken to poiiee headquarters and.
' the attending physiciar.s u&i
him to live through the night. "*
Thayer gives as a reason f< c his act
that his life has been one of continuous
trouble and that at times he has had an
almost ungovernable impulse to end his
career. Feeling particularly biue to
day he decided to give up life's battle.
He first wrote a note to Coroner Ran
dall avowing his intention to kill him
self and requesting that his father, E.
F. Thayer of Oakland, be notified of
his death.
When he attempted suicide Thayer
was pei'fectly sober.
OAKLAND, April 4.â R. C. Thayer,
who attempted suicide in Seattle to
day, is the son of Ed Thayer, a Ninth
street saloon-keeper. A few days ago
he went to Seattle after recovering
from a wound he inflicted on himself
at San Jose two months ago in a vain
endeavor to end his life. Young Thayer
has been a cause of anxiety to his
father for years on account of his er
ratic actions. He has mot c than once
attempted to commit suicide, and is
subject to spells of despond* ncy. The
manager of his father's saloon had Rot
heard of the lad's latest attempt to
die, but said that there was no doubt
young Thayer was not responsible at
times, imagining he was suffering from
all kinds of sickness. He is about 22
years old.
Some weeks ago young Thayer was
buying a revolver, and it was accident
ally discharged by a shop girl, who did
not know it was loaded. He was at the
hospital, but the bullet was not re
moved and is still in his hip. Thayer
has a wife and child living in San Jose.

Senators Speak Plainly
on the Blowing Up
of the Maine.
Perkins of California Among
Those to Denounce Treach=
cry of Spain and Demand
Satisfaction in Blood.
Call Office, Rlggs House,
Washington, April 4.
It vr&s frankly and openly charged In
the Senate to-day by Perkins of Cali
fornia, la a set speech, that Spain was
responsible for the Maine disaster, as
It had been brought about by Spanish
machinations and Spanish treachery.
The Bpeecb of Perkins was only one of
four prepared addresses on the Cuban
question delivered In the Senate to
day. Clay of Georgia, while hoping for
a peaceful solution of the problem the
country is now facing, declared strong
ly In favor of the independence of the
Cubans, and pledged to the administra
tion the loyal support of the South,
which, In the event of war, would have
t bear the brunt of the conJliet. Per
kins took substantially the same
grounds, and his vigorous treatment of
ister aroused the crowded
to enthusiastic applause.
C Montana, while expressing
the administration, main
tained that the tune for action had now
Li action must be to the
â¢end that Cuba should be free. Rawlins
rely eliminated the Presi
dent from consideration in his speech,
holding that the case against Spain was
alr<.-;uiy made up, and that with Con
ed the responsibility of de
ng war. Forcing us to wait longer
only to invite criticism. He de
dared for th.- most vigorous action im
ately.
Perkins of California, In a speech on
â¢ 'Ã¼ban question, declared that the
blowing up of the Maine by the Span
ish officials was an act of war, and he
believed it was so regarded by the na
tions of the world. Perkins referred
briefly to the scheme instituted by
Weyler to starve more than a million
Spanish subjects into subjection,
1 and declared that nothing in all his
tory compared with the atrocity and
brutality that Weyler had exercised
against the Cubans. The time for ac
; ':;lon, arrived.
little more delay," said he, "a
little more waiting, and the Unite<l
s will become an accessory to the
greatest, the most appalling crime in
ry. The patience of a great na
tion has Its limits, so in this case the
limit has been reached. The time for
the honors in Cuba to cease has come
and cease they must. t
"Right, justice and humanity de
mand that this Government should
intervene to stop the cruel warfare
being waged by Spain against the
Cuban insurgents â a people who are
struggling for their freedom within
ninety miles of our own shores."
Perkins, who has had a lifetime ex
perience in th" handling of great ves
sels, discussed the destruction of the
Maine from the view point of an ex
pert. He declared that our sailors and
officers had been beguiled by the de
ception of the Spaniards to a place in
a friendly harbor, and there, without a
minute's warning, been blown into
eternity. Captain Sigsbee, in com
municating to this Government the
news of t!v> awful disaster, had made
hlms"lf famous' in the eyes of the
civilized world by the diplomacy and
calmness of his language. There was

Spaniards, but while the people of the
nati' ! and still believe that
the catai trophe was due to Spanish
â¢ s, ('a;. tain Siu'sbee besought all
to Buspend judgment until the facts
" . â¢ â 
For forty days and nights the people
had suspended judgment, but now, that
the facts have been laid before them,
the verdict, he said, is unanimous that
the great battle-ship was blown up, not
only from the outside, but with the
cognizance of Spanish officials, for
whos.3 acts the Spanish Government
â¢was fully responsible. The explosives,
whether they were in a mine or a tor
pedo, were placed under the Maine by
officials of the Spanish Government.
The people believe that they were ex
ploded by design, and he was one who
held to that belief. It would have been
impossible, Perkins said, for any man
or sot of men to place in the harbor
of Havana mines or torpedoes without
the knowledge of the Government au
thorities. No impartial Judge would
fail, after considering all the facts pre-
Kor.tod. to place the responsibility for
the crime upon the Spanish Govern
ment through its authorized officials.
"This hideous crime of the nineteenth
century, "dorlnred Perkins vehemently,
"was an act of war, and I believe that
It is so regarded by the nations of the
world." .-.,.:.â  -/i
No offer of reparation could wipe out
the feeling of the people of this coun
try upon the matter, and intensity had
been added to that feeling by the al
most frivolous manner in which the
disaster had been treated by Spain..
Perkins said that while he favored
arbitration, individuals never attempt
ed to arbitrate questions of honor, and
nations could not afford to submit such
questions to arbitration. Gold could
not atone for the loss of those precious
lives. The only honorable action for
this country now to take was to inter
vene and .free Cuba from the yoke of
Spain, which she had so long borne.
Mantle of Montana followed with an
extended speech upon tlye absorbing
topic of Cuba, In which he declared that
he favored the independence of the Cu
ban people, who for years had been
StriiSTCrlinir for their fredom. "I would,"
paid he; "give my unqualified indorse
ment and vote in favor of directing the
Pr<-Pif]ont. to use armed forces, both
land nnd naval, to suppress the sav
njrpry thÂ»l is now rampant upon that
fair island." He had the highest rocard
for thes resent occupant of the White
HoiiFo. but it was perfectly evident to
oH that 'â â â â  time for diplomatic nego
tiation* r- Â»bo Ou'iin ouostion hnd
â  passed. . The time for action had ar
rived. And the sooner it was taken the
better it would be for all concerned.
Spain had violated "very principle of;
civilized warfare and had thrown hu
manity to tho winds. Mantle said it
was now time that the cry of humanity
! and the cry for stern Justice should be
neard. It was time to be done with
subterfuge. We should not go to war
1 without full justification, but must bÂ»
i assured before striking that we strike
I for God and humanity. He thought
| this time had come. He not only be
lieved the time had come for reeogniz
! ing Cuban independence, but that a
declaration of war would be fully Just
i ified by the willful destruction of the
Maine. While holding these sentiments,
Mantle was willing to wait upon the
' action of the Committee on Foreign Re
lations, whose recommendations he had
no doubt would be wise and just and
cover the whole case.
Rawlins of Utah said the case be
tween Spain and the United States was
made up. It was no longer for the
executive to decide what course to pur
sue. With Congress rested the re
sponsibility of declaring war, and this
was the pressing duty. The President
was no longer the party to be criti
cized. Congress, If it wills, he said,
could decide to have* peace with inci
dental outrage and clandestine murder.
As for himself, he did not choose to
accept peace under any circumstances.
Rawlins opposed further delay. He
war- informed that the Committee on
Foreign Relations had reached a con
clusion, and that while the President
was advised of the probable action of
the committee, that body had no such
information as to the President's plans.
He was also informed that the Presi
dent wanted further delay. Rawlins
did not consider this necessary. The
destruction of thÂ« Maine and the clan
destine murder of 266 of our sailors haa
occurred forty-eight days since, but
this was not all. For three years the
Spanish authorities had been impris
oning and murdering American citi
zens. Of these facts the executive
doubtlessly had been fully advised by
the consular reports, but these reports
had been withheld on the plea that it
would endanger the safety of our of
ficials in Cuba to give them out. Ir
this was true, it revealed a wretched
state of affairs.
' ''-ntinuing. Rawlins said delay had
been sought last week by friends of the
President on the plea that a message
was soon to be sent In from the Presi
dent which would meet all the demands
of the country. At the same time the
private and confidential secretary of
the President was sending a message to
his friends urging them to the utmost
exertion to bring pressure to bear to
secure peace. V'e were next told that
an ultimatum had been sent to Madrid
demanding the concession of Cuban in
dependence; now comes an interview
with Premier Sagasta in which he said
no demand had been made by this Gov
ernment for the ii. dependence of the
Cubans. Which representation was cor
rect? Rawlins criticized our halting
policy in strong language, tayine that
it was such as to justify Spain in hold
ing the United States in contempt. Ho
added that the crime of the explosion
of the Maine was due to our indecision
and cowardice, and that such an act
would never have been perpetrated
upon any other nation. In conclusion,
he made an argument for an absolute
declaration of war instead of a decla
ration for armed intervention. To pur
sue th<> latter course would be to throw
the responsibility of declaring war
upon the President. To pass such a
resolution would be to afford opportun
ity for the peace at any price to
continue its efforts as the resolution
would be one which the President could
with propriety ignore, because the re
sponsibility for definite action rests
with Congress.
Rawlins expressed the opinion that
four weeks would decide an armed con
flict between Spain and the United
States, and that it would be decided
without the loss of a life. In support
of this assertion "ie counted the accom
plishments of the Cubans themselves in
their efforts to t,ain their independence
under most unfavorable circumstances.
At the conclusion of Ra.wlins' speech
the sundry civil appropriation bill was
taken up.
MAY ASSEMBLE
AT CHICKAMAUGA.
General Miles Believes the Famous
Battle Field a Good Place for
Concentration of Troops.
WASHINGTON, April 4.â lt has
been decided to detain for a time at
the Chiekamauga battle-field the
, Twenty-tifth Regiment of Infantry,
'â  which is about to leave the various

NEW YORK, April 4.â lt was stated
at the navy-yard to-day that orders
had been received from Washington
for the sailing of the big battle-ship
Texas, and that she would leave this
port not later than Wednesday
Rumor at the navy-yard was to the
effect that the Texas is to proceed to
sea to meet the San Francisco and
New Orleans, now en route from Eng

Government Is Guilty.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, April 4.â Details have been
obtained of the manufacture of sub
marine mines In London for Spain,
which fact was first brought to the
attention of the United States embassy
on March 4. A man, whose cards de
scribed him as an electrical engineer
and whose name was forwarded at the
time to Washington, then said he sold
to Spanish officers in London several
years ago, a large number of mines,
eight or ten of which were placed In
Havana harbor. He said they were
made In a special way, had a specially
constructed cable, which he can iden
tify if the smallest piece is produced,
and he added that some of the mines
were fixed so that they could be fired
from a fort, while two of them had
bulbs so arranged that they would ex
plode upon a vessel coming into con
tact with them. The man added, how
ever, that he did not believe the bulbs
would be used in water as shallow as
that of Havana harbor. Finally the
man exhibited plans of one of these
mines, which he said was the most
likely to produce the effect described as
causing the wreck of the Maine. It
was numbered "2," and was construct
ed to contain 500 pounds of guncotton.
Lieutenant-Commander J. C. Colwell,
the United States naval attache, has
since investigated the matter, and he
made a report on the subject to the
United States Government. The facts
learned strongly tend to show that
Havana harbor was mined, and . un
questionably prove that Spain pur
chased mines for that purpose. The
firm of Lattimer, Rhodes & Clark,
electrical engineers, during 1887-88 filled
a large order for Spain for a lot of
mines, in which were used fourteen and
a half tons of guncotton. The work
was directly under the surveillance of
General Fernandez and Captain Busta
mento. The latter was then the head
of the Spanish torpedo school. By order
of these officers, the mines were divided
into four consignments â for Havana,
Ferrol, Cadiz and Carthagena. The
mines were manufactured under the
direction of J. P. Gibbons, after Gib
bons' patents, which are described in
Siemens' book on torpedoes and mines.
Gibbons, who furnished Lieutenant-
Commander Colwell a written state
ment of the above facts and outlined
his theory of the explosion which
wrecked the Maine, was then employed
by the firm as superintendent of the
torpedo department. He also says a
similar lot of torpedoes was manufac
tured for Spain in 1896.
The manager of the Westminister En
gineering Company, which is the suc
cessor of the aforementioned firm, and
with which Gibbons is connected, con
firms the latter's statement as to the
manufacture of mines for Spain. Gib
bons, who is a former sergeant of en
gineers and a Government inspector of
torpedoes, believes the Maine's first ex
plosion was caused by what is techni
cally called a ground mine, containing
500 pounds of gun cotton, several of
which were manufactured for Spain.
He has experimented with these mines
largely at Portsmouth, and says that
once laid, they retain their properties
for fifty years. In addition. Gibbons
asserts that it is absolutely Impossible
for them to explode accidentally, as
the electrical currents for their explo
sion are formed only by the manipula
tion of a complicated key. especially
devised to avoid accidents. Three keys
are necessary, which are always kept
in the possession of different officers
and if an outsider obtained possession
of them, it would h^ impossible to ma
nipulate the kr-ys without ins-f ruotions.
Gibbons further says the mines and
their connecting cables are numbered
and he asserts he would be able to
identify them if any party 1b secured.

drawal of the Spanish Minister, Senor

FOR AUXILIARY
SHIPS OF WAR
The President Directs the
Purchase of Ten Mer
chant Vessels.
Steamers That Will Be Trans
formed Into Cruisers With
out Delay.
Smaller Boats Will Alao Be Fitted Ou
and Commissioned as Torpedo-
Boat Destroyer*.
SpÂ«ctal DiÃDatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April 4.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: That the
President believes that war will likely
follow the transmission of his message
to Congress is shown by his action to
day in directing the purchase of ten
merchant vessels of from 2000 to 6000
tons burden for conversion into auxil
iary vessels. On account of the im
mense cost of such ships the Navy De
partment has heretofore refrained from
buying them, believing that diplomacy
might open the way for the settlement
of the Cuban question with honor to
both countries and without war. In
fact, it has been admitted by depart
ment officials that only when the ad-
ministration felt that war was bound
to come would the President consent to
the expenditure of such a large sum of
money as would be necessary in the ac
quisition and transformation of mer
chant vessels into auxiliary cruisers.
The fact, therefore, that the President
directed Assistant Secretary Roosevelt
to instruct the Rodgers board in New
York to. enter Into negotiations for the
purchase of vessels for transformation
into auxiliary cruisers is considered
most significant. In reality, this is the
first practical step taken to obtain an
auxiliary ileet. Ihe yachts and tugs
that have been bought have been con
â  verted into torpedo-boat destroyers and
picket boats, but such vessels as the
President directed to be purchased can
only be employed as members of the
first line of defense and offensive and
in defensive operations against the
enemy in conjunction with men-of-war
i comprising squadrons at Key West and
Hampton Roads. In compliance with
instructions sent by Roosevelt it is ex
! pected by the officials that the board
! went to work to-day to inspect eigh
i teen vessels that the department had
i selected for purchase in case the Presi
'â¢ dent should authorize such action. This
! list does not include the St. Paul and
i St. Louis, but from present indications
! the authorities will authorize their pur
chase within the next few days. No
! decision has been reached, but it was
j said to-day that the question of their
I purchase would be finally determined
! to-morrow in order that there might be
time in which to give orders to hold
the St. Paul, and to transfer her cargo
to some other vessel of the American
line.
These ships would cost about $4,000,
000, which the President does not at
present feel inclined to pay in the event
that other vessels which will be pur
chased may meet the navy's needs in
this respect. The vessels to be pur
chased will be from this list: El Sol,
El Paso, El Monte, El Mar. El Dorado,
El Norte. Yorktnwn, Jamestown, H. F.
Dimock, John English, Yumuri, Aca
pulco and Princess Ann. Some of the
vessels plying in and out of Boston har
bor are looked upon with f vor by the
board, and several of these may be
purchased. It is admitted by ofttcials
that the cost of these ten vessels will
be large, amounting to five or six mil
lion dollars, but the national defense
fund Is not exhausted, and will be able
to stand the inroau which wi.l be made
by the purchase of these ships.
Anticipating the purchase of these
ships, Captain Charles O'N'oill. chief of
the Bureau of Ordnance, is preparing
batteries to be placed aboard <>t them,
and Chief Naval Constructor Hichborn
is considering poi ts to which the ves
sels may be sent in order that the
work of transforming them may be ex
pedited as quickly as possible. ' It is the
expectation of officials that by work
ing night and day they will be able to
place the snips in commission within
three weeks. Crews will be collectpd
for these vessels, and they will be at
tached to the flying squadron and Cap
tain W. T. Sampson's Beet without de
lay. Orders were telegraphed to-day
to convert into auxiliary men-of-war
without delay the yachts and tugs pur
chased on Saturday last. The list in
cludes the yacht Josephine, which will
be converted at League Island; the
yacht Sovereign, which is at the New
York navy-yard; the steam lighters
Saturna and Irrawaddy, which will bo
converted into transports at the New
York navy-yard; the lighter L,ob.inon,
which is at Boston, and thp R. W. "Wii
mot, which is at the Pensnmla navy
yard. The Creole will be sent to New
port iÂ»ews, where she will be trans
formed into a hospital ship. The only
vessel whose name has born changed is
the Josephine, which has been officially
christened the Vixen, in commemora
tion of the famous American sloop of
the war of ISI2.

POWERS MAY
PREVENT WAR
Notes Are Being Ex
changed by the Eu
ropean Capitals.
Great Pressure Brought to Bear
That Is Likely to Compel
Spain to Yield.
What Common Oround thÂ« Powers
Ars Seeking to Reach Can Only
Be Conjectured.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CaJl Office, Riggs House,
Washington, April 4.
Notwithstanding the many reports of
European mediation they assumed their
first tangible form this afternoon when
at least two of the European establish
ments In Washington received notifi
cation that the exchange of notes be
tween the great powers was In prog
ress, with a view of arriving at a basis
on which they could make a joint pro
posal for mediation. It is evident that
the exchange has not yet been produc
tive of a common understanding, as the
Embassadors and Ministers at Wash
ington have not yet received Instruc
tions to initiate the movement. Their
only information thus far is that the
notes are passing by telegraph between
the capitals of Europe. It had been un
derstood that France and Austria were
most active In bringing about this
movement and that Great Britain had
held aloof from it, but it developed to
day that the British Government was
also taking part in the exchange and
that in case of concerted action by the
powers Great Britain would probably
act with the others.
What common ground the powers are
seeking to reach can only be conjec
tured. The Spanish Government seems
to be hopeful of the result from this
movement and this inspired additional
ground for the belief that it will not be
regarded with favor by the United
States. The diplomats, however, think
that if a common understanding was
reached by the great powers of Eu
rope, such suggestions as these great
powers would make could not be lightly
set aside. The general view of the dip
lomats is that the movement is not so
much one toward reconciling the United
States and Spain as it it is to preserve
the peace of the world by combined
action.
Spain's policy in this matter is one of
urging on the European powers that if
Cuba was free from Spanish sov
ereignty the next move under the Mon
roe doctrine would be to bring an end
to European control over other West
Indian possessions. Great Britain,
France and Denmark have interests in
that locality. In other quarters it was
stated that the influence of the powers
was more likely to be asserted on Spain,
urging her to the largest possible meas
ure of concession.
Sir Julian Pauncefote, the British
Embassador, made a short call on
Judge Day to-day. It is understood
that it did not relate to the Cuban
question, as the Embassador has not
received instructions concerning media
tion or any other course of action. M.
Thebeau, first secretary of the French
embassy, also called at the State De
partment and had a talk v.ith Judge
Day on subjects other than the Cuban
question.
An arrangement was reached during
the day by which the UniLed States
and France will co-operate through
their Ministers with Denmark for the
establishment of a European cable with
the Danish island of St. Thomas. The
cable is owned by a Fren.h company,
but its use has become of vital im
portance to the United States as a basis
of operations in the Leeward Islands.
Secretary Long was particularly de
sirous of having this cable arrange
ment effected. As a result of the con
ference a message was sent to the
I United States Minister at Copenhagen
asking him to secure the consent of the
Danish Government, and the French
; authorities arranged to have their Mm
' ister at Copenhagen exert similar ln
; fluences. _____^______ ___
OLD GLORY HAULED
DOWN FROM THE WRECK.
Now That the Destroyed Battleship
Maine is Deserted the Exodus
From Havana Begins.
HAVANA. April 4.â Soon after sun
rlnwn to-night the tattered United
States flag was taken from the pan! of
the wrecked Maine, where it has floated
since February 17, two days after the
explosion. It was taken down by an
officer and a. boat's crew from the Fern.
The wrecking tugs Underwriter and
Merritt and the barges Chief and Sharp
left for American waters to-day.
Now that the exodus to the United
States is in full force there are inter
esting scenes at the office of Dr. lirun
ner. Hundreds stand around waiting
their turn to be vaccinated â oabies in
arms, scarecrow negroes, well-dressed
women, rich merchants and poor Amer
icans â in short, all kinds of people.
Rigid rules are observed and the first
come is first served. The stringency
of the quarantine against yellow fever
Is somewhat relaxed in view of the spe
cial circumstances, and also of the fact
that there is ' If le or no fever In the
island, but the smallpox prr.-hibition is
still in force, though it is believed that
the reeulation is not too stringently ap
plied, in view of the expected leaving
of the Mangrove, Bache, Olivette and
Mascotte.
American citizens only will be given
passage on the Mangrove and Bache.
Others, if their passports and vaccina
tion certificatets are all right, can
leave on the Mascotte or the Olivette.
STABS A SCHOOLMATE
FOR TORMENTING HIM.
Lad Objects to a Demonstration Cre
ated by the Wearing of New
Trousers.
FRESNO, April 4.â Bruce Maiden, a boy
attending the Central school, in this city,
created consternation In the school yard
this morning by stabbing a schoolmate
named Ralph Harbison. The youths are
both about the same age. The trouble
arose over Harbison teasing Maiden be
cause of a pair of new trousers which the
latter wore to school. All the boys joined
in the plaguing, pinching Maiden, and in
boyish fashion asking him if it hurt.
Maiden put up with the tormenting for
some time. Finally his temper got the
better of him, and he rushed at his
schoolmate, and. after chasing him some
distance, overtook him. The result of the
scuffling was that Harbison was cut in
the back, the blade of Maiden's pocket
knife entering into the flesh until It
struck a. rib. Blood flowed freely from the
wound. The lad was taken home and a
phvslcian summoned to attend him.
The youthful knife wielder was not ar
rested, chiefly on account of his tender
age and the fact that he had heretofore
borne a good reputation among his school
mates. It is claimed that he did not stab
his companion intentionally, but had an
opened knife in his hand and in the scuffle
his companion was accidentally wounded.
WATCHING
THE SHIPS
OF FOES
United States and Spain
Keeping Tab on Each
Other's Vessels.
Information That the Torpedo
Flotilla Will Return to the
Canary Islands and Join
the Cadiz Squadron.
NEW YORK, April 4.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Offi
cial confirmation of the Herald's an-
nouncement this morning of the de
parture of the Carlos V from Havre for
Ferrol was contained In a dispatch re
ceived at the State Department from
Minister Woodford, who also reiterated
his statement of a few days ago that
the torpedo-boat flotilla had reached
Cape Verde Islands and that it had
been directed to await orders.
Much to the regret of officials the
Minister made no reference to the con
dition of the boats comprising the flo
tilla, and the matter was deemed so
important that a dispatch was sent to
him during the afternoon, asking him
to instruct Lieutenant Dyer, naval at-
tache of this Government in Madrid,
to ascertain their condition, if possible,
and to inform the authorities here as
soon as he had learned anything of im
portance. Information on this point
is expected to reach Washington to
morrow. The sharp watch which is
being maintained by this Government
in Madrid over the movements of Span
ish men-of-war is well illustrated by
Minister Woodford's dispatches of the
last few days. Every movement of
Spanish vessels has been chronicled
and no effort has been spared by the
Minister, attaches of the legation and
consular officers throughout Spain to
enable the authorities here to obtain
this and such other naval information
as will be useful to the United States
in the event of war.
There is reason to believe that Min
ister Polo y Barnabe and attaches of
the Spanish legation are transmitting
information respecting the movements
of American vessels and increases
which have recently been made to the
American navy. Before the departure
of Lieutenant-Commander Sobral, na
val attache of Spain in this city, it was
not an unusual thing to see him at the
department discussing United States
naval matters with the officials and ob
taining naval information, which he
hastened to transmit to his Govern
ment. He was always courteously
treated â  and considerable information
was given to him. His treatment is in
violent contrast with that accorded to
Lieutenant Dyer, naval attache of this
Government in Spain.
Lieutenant Dyer is followed by de
tectives, all requests concerning the
navy of Spain are abruptly refused, and
he is not allowed to visit Spanish navy
yards. Notwithstanding the difficulty
under which Lieut. nant Dyer labors he
is able to keep the office of naval in
telligence here very well informed in
regard to the condition of construction
or repairs to vessels at navy yards and
of the movements of Spanish ships.
It is the firm expectation of officials
that the Spanish torpedo-boat flotilla
will not continue on its way to Porto
Rico, but will be recalled from Cape
Verde to the Canary Islands, where it
will meet the Spanish fleet, which Min
ister Woodford said yesterday was on
the eve of departure from Cadiz. As
the Herald stated this morning the au
thorities do not believe for an instant
that any of the vessels of the flotilla
have been damaged by reason of the
bad weather, for tl.e meteorological rec
ords which they have looked up show
that good weather usually prevails in
the section through which tl^e flotilla
passed.
Ferrol, to which the Carlos V is
bound, is the location of one of the
largest navy-yards in the Cpanish
kingdom, and the vessel has been sent
to that point, the authorities believe, in
order that she ma- be completed with
all possible speed. She is one of the
most formidable armored cruisers of
the Spanish navy, and, under ordinary
conditions, could not be completed until
the latter part of May. Information
which has reached the Navy Depart
ment shows that it is the intention of
Spain to rush the completion of the
Carlos V, in order that she may be at
tached to the squadron mobilizing at
Cadiz, and sail with it to the Canaries.
There is a great deal of speculation
in naval circles concerning the destina
tion of the Vizcaya and the Almirante
Oquendo, which left Havana last Fri
day to escape being bottled up by Cap
tain Sampson's fleet. The authorities
expected, if these vessels had gone
to Porto Rico, to have heard of their
arrival at San Juan to-day, but no an
nouncement that they had reached this
point came to the State Department
this afternoon. The report that the
vessels are to be ordered back to Hav
ana is not believed by naval experts,
for by such action, they say Spain
would stand an excellent chance of los
ing two of the best cruisers of her navy.
If they should return to Havana it
will be an easy matter for Captain
Sampson's fleet to blockade them in the
harbor, and thus reduce the fighting
strength of the Spanish navy by two
formidable vessels. There seems to be
a general impression in naval circles
that in the event of war the Vizcaya nnd
Oquendo will re-eivi orders to proceed
to some northern port of the United
States and do as much damage to prop
erty as possible, afterward going
abroad to join the Cadiz squadron.

Exciting Contest Results in thÂ«
Choice of Burke for Mayor.
SANTA BARBARA, April 4.â ln many
ways to-day's election has been the most
remarkable ever contested In this city,

City C'ouncilmen being elected. The count
in the Third Ward is progressing very
slowly, so that it will not be known be
fore to-morrow who is elected Council
man. Indications point to the defeat of
Caesar Lataillade, who has been known
as the boss of the ward for years.
The following are elected: E. M. Burke,

RIDGEWAY. 111., April 4.â To-night
almost two score bodies of the victims
of the Shawneetown flood have been
recovered, and hundreds of homeless
people are dependent upon charity for
food and shelter. The death list is
likely to be largely increased when defi
nite information from the negro quar
ter, which suffered most, is secured.
The flood burst on these people with
out warning, and owing to the wealc
construction of their shanties they top
pled over in the rush of water, leaving
their inmates no means of getting out
nf danger. Hundreds of people who
lived farther from the river front
sought safety on roofs and in upper
stories or made retreat to the hills to
the west. These are being removed as
rapidly as possible to places where they
can be given proper care. No effort has
yet been made to search for bodies, the
attention of the relief parties being di
rected almost entirely to the distribu
tion of supplies and making the home
less as comfortable as possible. The re
lief work is well organized. Tents and
blankets sent by the Governor to-day
will bs promptly distributed. Those
who escaped lost everything and their
homes are in ruins. The missing, as
far as known to-night, are:
Colonel Calllcot.
Wash Callicot.
Mrs. Calllcot.
Mrs. Galloway.
Dora Galloway.
Mary Galloway.
Mrs. Hollls.
Mrs. Greer.

Frank A. Morrison.
Mrs. A. A. Hathaway.
Late to-night it It estimated that the
loss of life in the negro quarter may
reach fifty, besides those accounted for.
Ed Flake, whose wife was drowned,
came to Cypress Junction to-day and
said that there were fifteen people in
his house when the flood struck the
building. Only himself and one other
succeeded In escaping before the build
ing toppled over. Flake was hysterical
from grief and could not give the names
of the thirteen who were lost.
Marsh Callicot, the son of Wash Cal
llcot and wife, who perished, made a
heroic effort to save his parents. He
secured a rowboat and got within
forty feet of where his mother and
father were imprisoned. The swift cur
rent prevented him from getting nearer.
The parents stood in the yard in water
to their waists awaiting the arrival of
the boat. Suddenly a wave swept them
into the current and they were drowned
before their son's eyes.
David Rookendoffer and wife were in
their home, directly in the path of the
huge wave that swept through the
broken dyke. Their little son in the
yard saw the wave coming and hur
riedly climbed a tree. The father and
mother had time to rush upstairs when
the house was swept from its founda
tion. They climbed on the roof as the
house floated off and heard their little
eon. in the tree say: "Good-by, papa
and mamma." The agonized parents
were powerless to get to his assistance,
and in a few moments the house had
been carried beyond the reach ; of the
boy's voice. They floated from the
north levee to the south levee, a dis
tane of a mile, and wfre taken off in
safety. The little son was subsequently
rescued in the treetop by a boat and the
family reunited. '
Mr. Rookendoff er said that as he
floated down the current on the house
top he saw people drowning on all
Bides. The colored quarter of the city,
known as "Negro flats," was ' com
pletely inundated by the rush of water.
It is believed that a large number of
colored people perished, 1 as the ground
was flooded in a twinkling and to-night
the water stands twenty-five feet deep
in that locality. r #. â 
J. T. Hogan of Omaha, 111., left the
scene of the flood half an hour -before

Sheriff Galloway of Gallatin " County,
whose home was in Shawneetown, had
the. same; good fortune. The Sheriffs
wife ; and two daughters were â â ' swept

THE BREAK IN THE LEVEE.
This Picture Represents a Scene on the Ohio River Above Shaw
neetown, 111., When the Levee Broke During the Great Flood of
1883. Drawn From a Picture and Description by an Eye Witness
About 5 o'clock last evening, he said,
the levee on the north side of town gay.Â»
away at the north end of Market street,
near the Courthouse. An opening ten
feet wide was at first made, but it
quickly spread to twenty, and a wall
of water ten or fifteen feet high poured
through the main street, sweeping
everything before it. About fifty Â«?mall
frame houses along the line of the lev t -e
to the south were crushed like toys and
none of the occupants, most of whom
were poor colored folks, escaped. Those
living in the more substantial hous-cs
managed to climb to second and third
stories,- where they clung for hours
through the chilly night. Houses in the
western part of the town did not at
once feel the effect of the flood and Â»esl
dents made hurried step* for safety,
most of them going to the leve; on the
smith si^e of the town. A loise num
ber also reached the little hills which
are a mile from the town and from
there saw their property crumble in
the muddy waters. TVhen daylight came
this morning the streets wer? full of
water to a depth of ten or twelve fett.
Only the most substantial buildings in
the central business district remain
standing. Water is everywhere.
Ridgeway, which is twelve miles
from Shawneetown, was made the
basis of relief, work. All rail com
munication bein^r cut off for four miles
out, boats were constructed this morn-
Ing and at once started to the scene.
ThfÂ»- reached a point within two miles
of the flooded town. More boats were
secured and the rescuers crossed to
Shawneetown. They found a sad con
dition existing in the ill-fated town.
Hundreds of those who escaped the
rush of wate were perched on roofs,
trees and along the top of the levee.
They were taken from their dangerous
positions as rapidly as possible. Owing
to the scarcity of boats, the work was
very slow, but over 200 persons, in
cluding many women and children,
were taken to the roadway, two miles
from Shawneetown, and thence to
Cypress Junction. Here the greater
part of them are camped to-night,
with very little to eat, and exposed to
the driving rain and piercing wind.
Cypress Junction is almost surrounded
by water, which has overflowed the
banks of the Wabash and is covering
the entire country. The overflow from
the broken dyke at Shawneetown has
backed two miles inland, but is to
night slowly receding. It will be im
possible to recover any bodies until
the waters recede very materially. In
fact, the rescuers are making very
little effort in that direction, but are
working to save those who escaped
alive. The Riverside Hotel and court
house and the Ridgeway Bank are in
tact and found to have been used by
the fleeing inhabitants for shelter.
The upper stories were crowded.
Last night the Catholic Academy, the
schoolhouse. City Hall and the River
side Hotel, all situated on high ground
above the water were crowded with
homeless people. Hundreds are to-night
sleeping on the water banks under
such rude shelter as they can construct
from the floating debris. Absolutely
nothing has been saved in the city. The
stores and other business houses are
flooded to the second floors. All the
streets are under water from ten to
thirty feet.
Provisions are constantly arriving
from all the neighboring towns. A re
lief train arrived here to-night, but
owing to the high winds and rough
ness of the water at the ferry crossing
all attempts to transfer the provisions
across have been abandoned. They have
been taken to the water's edge, and at
the break of day will be ferried across.
The heavy rain still continues, and at
6 o'clock a high cold wind sprang- up
adding to the misery of the sufferers in
the stricken town. At 11 o'clock to
night a telephone message was received
from Shawneetown saying that the
south levee was cracking and threaten
ing to go at any moment. It is about
sure that it will break before morning.
This will not add to the depth of the
water in the town, but will create a
current through the streets that will
prove dangerous to rescuers in skiffs.
THREATENED WITH
TOTAL DESTRUCTION.
Shawneetown May Bs Visited by a
Second Catastrophe Far More Seri
ous Than the First.
RIDGEWAY, 111.. April 4.âShawnee
town, flood-swept last night, is threat
ened with total destruction to-night.
Innumerable more lives may be lost
before another day has passed.
Hundreds of people have not yet been
rescued from the houses in which they
were imprisoned, others are still in the
tree tops and still others are afloat on
the waste of the torrent. Late reports
say the entire levee will be destroyed
by morning and every frame house in
town is certain to be dashed to pieces.
The wind is blowing thirty-five miles
an hour, with rain that cuts like glass.
Great fear is expressed for the rescue
force now in Shawneetown, as nothing
can resist the power of the waves dash
ing ten feet high under the impetus of
the gale. If the storm does not cease
the entire town is doomed as well as
most of the people who have not yet
leached the hilltops. This information
comes by telephone from the tempo
rary station on the hillsides west of
Shawneetown.

DEATH CHEATED
OF ONE CLAIMED
FOR ITS OWN
People of Lima Excited Over What
They Believe a Miraculous
Resurrection,
Copyrighted, IS9S. by James Gordon Bennett
LIMA, Peru, April 4. â Intense excitement prevails here over what
many citizens consider the miraculous resurrection of the Archbishop
of Lima, the most Rev. Manuel Antonio Bandini, D. D.
After an illness lasting many weeks the Archbishop apparently ex
pired at noon on Saturday last. He was seized by a paroxysm anci fell
back in bed. Those in attendance quickly felt his pulse and listened for
his breathing. Both, it was said, had ceased, and the Archbishop was
declared dead. Immediately word was passed through the city that the
prelate had expired. Bells were tolled throughout 4 a guard of
honor was placed about the episcopal palace and arrangements for the
funeral began.
The physicians present at the time when the Archbishop appar
ently expired were not entirely satisfied that life was extinct and on
the bare chance of reviving their distinguished patient they d termined
to resort to heroic measures. They injected caffeine and ether, and at
1 o'clock r the afternoonâ scarcely an hour after his pulse had ceased
âthe Archbishop opened his eyes languidly and gazed on the expectant
group which surrounded his bedside. Consternation prevailed for an
instant and even the physicians were surprised.
Then extraordinary efforts were made to restore him. These were
fairly successful and the Archbishop was able to thank those present
for their care.
The doctors say that the Archbishop has a peculiar physical or
ganization and that this fact Is responsible for the first announcement
of his death. At the farthest it will be only a few days before the pre
late is carried off, for he is weaker and sinking rapidly.
In the meantime many fanatical persons insist that a miracle has
been performed and are accordingly in a very excited state of mind.

pressed himself as confla^r 1 * of being
able to propose a plan whereby the
State Printing Office would be able to
resume its operations as soon as the
necessity arose. In an informal dis
cussion with the Attorney-General the
latter agreed with the Governor that
some plan could be devised, and no
doubt would be when the time arrived
for the printing of certain reports ex
pressly directed by law.
The State Treasurer appeared before
the board and laid before it the neces
sity of taking immediate steps to pro

recognized the force of Mr. Rackliffe's
claim, and the Governor assured him
that provision would be made for the
emergency. The Secretary of State will
be placed in a position to supply the
necessary stationery.
A deficiency of $2500 was allowed the
Secretary of State, who si ? ed the
necessity of it to the satisfaction of the
Governor and the Attorney-General.

AT A CANNERY
Riot at Milpitas Over

Chinese.
Officers Summoned From San

Arrest of Twenty Persons, Including
a Girl but Eighteen Years
of Age.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, April 4.â There was a riot
at the cannery at Mllpitas this morn
ing over the employment of Chinese.
About 150 Portuguese men and women
took part in the affair, and for a time
it looked as though the Chinese would
be roughly handled. Teams hauling
asparagus to the cannery were stopped
by the crowd. Superintendent Hodges
became alarmed and telephoned to the
Sheriff's office, asking for protection,
and Deputy Sheriff Gardner and a half
dozen deputies went to the scene of hos
tilities. Some twenty arrests were
made pÂ« charges of disturbing the
peace.
Among thost. arrested was Kate San
ders, an 18-year-old girl, who Is said
to have been the leader among her sex.
The following men were brought to the
County Jail, but were subsequently ta
ken back to Mllpitas to be arraigned:
M. P. Mendosa, T. A. Delamon, Manuel
Silvado, Manuel Fantado, Manuel de
Rosa, John Ceravigne and John Bar
tello. The others arrested were not
brought to San Jose.
The cannery is owned by the Oak
land Packing Company, of which Till
mann & Bendel are the principal stock
holders. It was erected a couple of
years ago for the purpose of canning
vegetables. Heretofore about forty
hands have been employed and the
work was given to people livin" in the
vicinity. This year, however, Chinese
were put Into the cannery. This aroused
the ire of the ex-employes, and this
morning the Portuguese residents gath
ered en masse to protest against the
employment of Mongolians. <

The Third Mate of the Bel

Journeys Across Alaskan Wilds,
Suffering Untold Hardships
and Enduring the Pangs
of Hunger.
VICTORIA, April 4.â Arriving at Departure Bay this morning the steam
schooner Albion brought the first news from the whaling fleet which six
months ago was imprisoned in the Ice, apparently with little hope of rescue,
in the frozen wilderness of the Arctic Ocean, east of Point Barrow. On
the Albion was G. F. Tilton, third officer of the steamship Belvedere, who char
tered that vessel at the mouth of Copper River to take him to Astoria,
whence he will go direct to Washington, D. C.
Mr. Tilton left the icebound whaling steamship to which he is attached
about six months ago, and, in company with a small party of Esquimaux,
made his way over the Ice and across the frozen Alaskan country to the
mouth of Copper River, where, luckily, he found the steam schooner Albion,
which had taken a party of prospectors to that district and was about to re
turn.
The journey, which occupied five months and twenty-two days, was a ter
rible one, for in many places, as the little band traversed the icy wilderness,
they had almost insurmountable difficulties to overcome. In places the ice
was piled up like mighty cairns, and they had to crawl up and over, carry-
Ing their food and supplies in small vessels. Often they were obliged to climb
carrying even their dogs on their backs.
To add t 3 the terrors of the arduous Journey the little band ran short of
supplies and had it not been for the skill of the natives in foraging they
would have starved. The natives were expert hunters and just when it
seemed hunger would prevent their proceeding to the coast they managed to
replenish their larder by oting bear or other animals. On several oc
casions they captured silver foxes, the skins of which ase very valuable, but
the pelts were not nearly so valuable in the eyes of Mr. Tiltoh and his com
rades as was their flesh, which kept the life in the half-frozen bodies of the
pilgf Ims.
The weather was frightfully cold and Mr. Tilton was severely frozen more
than once. His native companions, accustomed as they are to the rigors of
the northern climate, suffered severely yet they struggled on and ultimately
reached the coast in safety.
In October last passengers on the Bristol from Unalas!:a brought the news
that the steamship Orca, Captain Sherman; the steamship Belvedere, Captain
Millard; the steam tender Jeanie, Captain Mason; the steamship Fearless,
Captain McKenzie; the schooner Rosario, Captain Coffin, and at least one
other vessel had been pinned in the ice with little chance of their escaping
from destruction. Although there was room for hope that the crews of the
vessels might have been able to reach one of the Esquimaux settlements
there was great danger that the food supply would be limited and starva
tion inevitable. A relief expedition was organized and dispatched from Seat
tle, the United States revenue cutter Bear being detailed to do all possible to
rescue the men from a lingering death.
In an interview at Departure Bay. Mr. Tilton is reported to have said that
the men belonging to the whalers were, when he left, as comfortable as could
be expected, and the danger from starvation was not as great as had been
dreaded. He saw nothing of the revenue cutter Bear, and, in fact, did not
hear of the dispatch of the relief expedition until his arrival at salt water.
A dispatch received from Mr. Tilton himself at Nanaimo yesterday, on
the contrary, would seem to imply that he did meet the Jarvis expedition,
although the meeting may have taken place close to salt water. Mr. Til
ton's dispatch to The Call was:
NAXAIMO, B. C, April 4, 1398

SEATTLE, April 4.â At 2 o'clock to
morrow morning the United States
gunboat Wheeling will sail from this
port for Alaska. There was a general
hope expressed among the officers of
the Wheeling tl.at a change of orders
would come from the Navy Depart
ment. Captain Sebree says there are
a hundred picked men on board, and
they would prove a valuable adjunct
to one of our warships in case of a con

turn to Seattle with the Wheeling by
May 15.
The Wheeling has aboard the mem
bers of the Government geological sur
vey parties and their outfits of ten tons,
not including nine small cedar canoes.
The gunboat will steam direct to
Haines Mission from here. One o? the
geological parties will be landed there
with half the outfit From Haines
Mission she will go to Sitka for coal.
Then the other party will be landed on
the shore of Cooks Inlet.
The geological expedition will be com
posed of eight officers and eighteen men
in all. Half of them will go into the
interior of Alaska from Haines Mission.
The others will be landed in Cooks In
let at the mouth of the Rushinta River.
The party landed at Haines Mission or
Skaruay will be divided, and proceed
across the passes in charge of Messrs.
Barnard and Spear. They expect to
explore the headwaters of the White
and Tanc-na rivers, -Â»Â«fl one of the par

the Approval of the
Japanese.
Neither Russia Nor Germany Pleased
With This Success of Their
Enemy.
Special Dispatch to The Cal.
LONDON, April 4.â lt was semi
officially announced to-day that Great
Britain had made arrangements with
China to take over the port of Wei-
Hai-Wei, on the Shang Tung peninsu
la, when the ' 'linese Government has
paid the war indemnity cjjue to Japan
and the Japanese troops have evacu
ated the place. The arrangement, it is
added, was made with the knowledge
and approval of Japan, with which
country an agreement had previously
been arrived at. The latter fact was
kept secret until China had actually
agreed to the lease and the British fleet
had assembled in the vicinity.
It is said on good authority tha^
neither Russia nor Germany is pleased,
at the arrangement, and it is added
that the island of Leu Kung Tau, at ths
entrance of Wei-Hai-Wei, will be
strongly fortified, while the land bat
teries destroyed by the Japanese can
speedily be reconstructed.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 5, 1898.
THE LAW IS
ALWAYS RIGHT
Some Significant Remarks
by Circuit Judge
Morrow.
Orders of Court Must Be
Obeyed Even When
Wrong.
Twenty-Seven Members of tho Kla
math Lumber Company Up for
Disobeying an Order.
The greater part of yesterday after
noon In United States Circuit Judge Mor
row's court was spent in Investigating
the cases of the twenty-seven lumbermen
brought down from Klamathon, Siskiyou
County, on a charge of contempt of court.
The defendants are employes of the
Klamath River Lumber and Improve
ment Company. The sawmill and other
property of this company were claimed
by the Pokegama Lumber Company un
der a lease, which the Klamath people
say was violated by the lessees. There
upon the Klamath people retook posses
sion and ousted the lessees. A lawsuit
was the result and an Injunction re
straining the Klamath people from inter
fering with the Pokegama people was
Issued by the judge of the Superior Court
of Siskiyou County. When the matter
came to trial the court dismissed the
Injunction and purged the Klamaths of
contempt-
Thereupon the Pokegama Company be
gan a suit in the United States court, and
upon a showing made by them Judge
Morrow issued a restraining order. Dep
uty United States Marshal Gallagher was
cent up to serve the order and he found
considerable difficulty in doing so. After
he had left, barricades were erected by
the Klamaths and the Pokegama people
were not allowed to enter ur>on or use
the property.
Complaint was again made, and Judge
Morrow issued citations for the arrest of
the officers and attorneys of the com
pany and employes to the number of
twenty-seven defendants all told on a
charge of contempt of court.
Al the parties appeared in court yes
terday.
Mr. Plllsbury opened the proceedings by
reading an affidavit of Ueputy United
Mates Marshal Gallagher, setting forth
that when he visited the mills at KJama
uion to serve the restraining order W.
t. Cook disputed his authority, and the
tact that the signature of Judge Morrow
was genuine. When Gallagher tried to
enter the mill office. Cook put hi.s foot
in the doorway, threw his weight against
the door and attempted to force out Deu
uty Gallagher.
The Deputy Marshal could not get In
side, and he was, therefore, obliged to
post on the outside of the mill a certified
copy of the restraining order and the
aubpenas.
The affidavit went on to stats further
that H. B. Gillis. an attorney for the
defendants, told the affiant that he had
advised his clients not to regard the re
straining order and not to permit officers
of the law to enter upon the premises.
Attorney Stratton announced that At
torney Gillis would read a personal affi
davit in reply to that of the Deputy Mar
shal. It made a general denial of the
allegations made, and went on to state
that Gillis said he asked Gallagher
whether he conceived it to be his duty
to take forcible possession of the prop
erty, and that Gallagher replied that he
did not, and that he did not intend to
take possession of it. He claimed that
Gallagrher misunderstood the purport of
his remarks.
John S. Cook's affidavit set forth that
he had refused to open the door for the
Deputy Marshal, and that while he re
spected the paper issued by Judge Mor
row, he could not recognize the right of
the persons accompanying the Deputy
Marshal to enter. If the Marshal had
come alone he would have admitted him
He stated that the Judge of Siskiyou had
dismissed an injunction similar in purport
to Judge Morrow's restraining order and
he thought that decision was good law
Judge Morrow postponed further con
sideration of the case until to-morrow
morning. Thfn the court Hpoke its mind
on the merits of the contempt case. It
was not for the lawyers, said Judge Mor
row, or other persons, to construe the or
der of the court. The order must be
obeyed literally and without evasion or
quibbling.
"This is a very serious matter in the
T nited States courts." added the Judge,
'and it is the duty of all Judges to pun-
Hh contempt severely, and if there
Is anything of the kind in this case I shall
certainly do so. Even if the court was
wrong to issue a mandatory injunction, it
is not for the attorneys here or for others
to construe it. If the language was platn
it should be obeyed even if it was wrong
-even if the court had no right to issue
the injunction. The flrFt thing to be done
is to obey the order of the court the very
moment called on by this court. Defen
dants must not decide the case for them
selves."
It was agreed by thp counsel, at the
suggestion of Ju.lere Morrow, that no
more arrests should be made, and that
the defendants would not interfere with
the peaceable possession and use of the
property ponding the final disposition or
the case.

is not only a good carrier, but is very
fast.
The schooner Thomas S. Negnis, which
arrived here some weeks ago with a par
ty of gold hunters from New Haven,
Conn., had to return to port last Sunday.
A start was made for Copper River, but
when be sot outside Captain Erratt found
that thirty-two tons of ballast and the
outfit for the minors was too much for the
schooner. The Negus was brought

tern tons of lead molded to her hull and
sixteen tons of pig iron on top of that
The pig Iron will be removed and then
the schooner will go to sea again.

WHERE ARE THE
ELECTION BOOTHS?
Registrar Biggy Instructed to
Look Into Kennedy's Con
tract With the City.
Plan of Precincts Used for the Free
holders' Election to Be Used
Again in May.
One of the first duties of the new Regis
trar will be to investigate the right of
Mr. Kennedy to draw $50 a month from
the city treasury. At a meeting of the
Election Commissioners yesterday, Mr.
Broderick called attention to the fact
that Kennedy, who formerly kept a lum
ber yard, had entered into a contract
with the city to take care of the election
booths at the price named, but that he
hud recently retired from business. The
commission instructed Registrar Biggy to
look into the matter and ascertain what
has become of the booths, and whether
Kennedy is still caring for them or has
turned them over to somebody else and
is drawing pay without performing his
contract.
Mr Creswell moved that the plan of
precinct division used for the freeholders"
election last December be adopted again
for the charter election on May 26. Brod
erick was the only member who opposed
the motion, which was adopted. It was

cincts was ready and would be used for
the next general election.

of the call for the charter flection in the
three morning and three afternoon pap
ers for ten days preceding the election.

and listened to the statements of several
contractors at work on the new Mission

in a dispute among; themselves regarding

THE FIRE WAS A
DOLLAR A MILE
How J. K. Prior Got Even
With the Southern Pa
cific Company.
Ho Rode Free on a Special
From Castroville to San
Jose.
Loss of Time Made Up by the Con
ductor in Starting His Train
Ahead Five Minutes.
To J. K. Prior of this city is due the
credit of beating the Southern Pacific
Company at one of its own gamesâ that
of compelling it to disgorge the price of a
special train at the rate of a dollar a
mile.
The circumstance which brought about
this unusual condition of affairs between
the company and one of Us passengers
without the intervention of a court of
Justice occurred on the road between Cas
troville and San Jose. Prior, who is a
millionaire in his own name, is possessed
in addition to his wealth with a whole lot
of backbone and a very stiff neck on his
shoulders. On this occasion, the 27th of
last February, he had urgent business in
San Miguel, where he owns a ranch of
65,000 acres. Having disposed of his busi
ness at that place, he boarded a train
on Sunday morning, intending to arrive
at his home the Batne night. When the
train arrivec at Castrovllle it was twelve
minutes behind schedule time, and as it
was the noon hour the conductor made
the announcement that twenty minutes
would be given for lunch.
On the arrival of the train all hands
hurried to the company's restaurant, ex
cept Prior and two San Francisco drum
mers, who preferred to patronize an op
position refreshment place alongside.
This they did, but on their return to the
depot they found the train had left five
minutes ahead of time. The station agent
was consulted, and in explanation he
stated that this was necessary in order
to make up the lost time on the road be
tween that place and San Miguel. Here
the San Francisco capitalist saw his op
portunity to insist on his rights and lie
lost no time in carrying out his desire.
He demanded to be conveyed to his des
tination.
The company's agent saw no way to ac
comodate him, as no other train would
pass the station that day. Prior did not
care whether a train ever camÂ© along or
not, his ticket was bought and paid for
and go he must. In this dilemma the best
the agent could do was to telegraph to
headquarters for instructions, which he
did. The answer came back that Mr
Prior could arrive at his home on time
by hiring a special engine, balancing
himself as best he could on u.e cow
catcher. The answer to this invitation
was that "Mr. Prior had something to
live for and as he had no accident insur
ance on his life he respectfully declined "
The agent once more tapped the wire
and the answer to this was that the com
pany had some choice special cars on
hand for such fastidious passengers as
the San Francisco millionaire at the rate
cf a dollar a mile and that it would be
only too glad to accommodate him at
that figure. The special was engaged
and the sum of $60 paid and a receipt
taken for the same. In this special
equipped conveyance Mr. Prior and his
two drummer friends rode the sixty
miles into San Jose in so many minutes

and In time to catch th 3 5 o'clock train
for this city.
In the course of a few days Mr. Prior
made a social call on the railroad mag
nates at the office on Montgomery street,
and, after transacting some business, it
suddenly occurred to him that there was
$60 in their hands that he had use for. He
made a demand for this amount, and as
soon as he finished his statement the
gentleman to whom he made it nearly
dropped out of his chair in astonishment
at so bare-faced a proposition.
A consultation was held between a few
of the leading lights of the company, and
it was agreed to refer the matter to Mr.
FUlmore for his opinion. To this propo
sition Mr. Prior demurred. He did not
desire to appear before Mr. Fillmore. It
was finally agreed that the matter be
submitted to Mr. Goodman.
Thus matters stood uni.il last Friday
when Mr. Prior was notified to appear at
the office of the passenger agent, which
he did, and after giving his explanation
of the transaction he was handed back
his $60. He bowed himself out of the
office and returned to Ms business with
the happy consolation that he had ridden
6ixty miles in sixty minutes on a first
claes special and at the company's ex

Jennie Farrell, a girl 12 years of age,
was arrested yesterday morning by De
tectives Fitzgerald and Graham of the
Mission district and Is being detained In
the City Prison pending the- hearing of
charges against her motner.
Mrs. Cusack, who lives In the same
house as Jennie's mother, at 6S Hermann

articles from her rooms, and when a
valuable violin disappeared a day or two
ago she determined to keep a close
watch upon her rooms. Yesterday morn
ing she observed Jennie leaving the house
with a bundle under her arm. She stopped
her, and on examining the bundle found
that it contained one of her table cloths
and a pan.
Mrs. Cusack detained the girl and noti
fied the Seventeenth-street police station,
and Detectives Fitzgerald and Graham
were detailed on the case. They ques

YOUR WEAK SPOT.
If You Do Not Know Where It Is You
Should Find Out and Strengthen It.
Where is the weak spot In your sys-
tem?
Is It a weakness of the stomach which
causes indigestion, dyspepsia, biliousness,
constipation, headaches and backaches,
or is it a general weakness which maJtea
you suffer from tired, languid feelings?
Wherever or whatever your particular
weakness may be, you can, if you will,
get rid of it and replace it with health,
6trength and vigor. Do you know how?
If not, you can profitably road the fol-
lowing opinions on the subject and get
some valuable information.
Mrs. M. McMahon of 1 Sumpter street,
Brooklyn, says: "I was formerly much
troubled with indigestion, but have been
entirely cured by using Duffy's Pure Malt
Whiskey, which I can sincerely recom-
mend. It gave me relief when all other
remedies failed."
Mrs. J. W. Connor of Fitehburg, Mass.,
says: "I was in bad health and feeling
very miserable and low spirited when a
friend advised me to try Duffy's Puro
Malt Whiskey. I did so, and am now feel-
ing stronger, happier and healthier than
1 have felt in years. It has worked won-
ders in my case."
Hundreds of similar opinions could be
furnished, but the above are quite suffi-
cient to prove that Duffy's Pure Malt
Whiskey is unequalfd for its stimulating,
strengthening effects. It purifies and
quickens the blood, promotes digestion
and makes sound, healthy flesh. It should
be remembered, however, that it is not an
ordinary whiskey, but is unlike any other.
On this account be sure and get only tha
genuine and accept no inferior imitation.

SENATOR PERKINS TfIKES THE AMER
ICAN VIEW.
* T "HE speech of Senator Perkins delivered yes
. ] terday will be indorsed by the people of Califor
â  nia. Indeed, they had already, so far as possi
. placed themselves on record as upholding the
â ~, : ,js<Stttiments he expressed. The Senator said frankly
;Â»!:..; t.K- sinking of the Maine was an act of war. and
by passing it over as an incident this country
\vould become accessory to an unexampled crime.
:)1 he truth could not have been more directly told.
.This paper has insisted that the destruction of the
':/â  battle-ship was our one legitimate pretext for hos-
While the struggle was strictly between
-:i and her subjects, the way was not open, however
V.v.ich. the conditions might have appealed to hunian
' ity.fxr an outside power to interfere. But by treach
;; e.ry. fur which history affords no precedent, Spain
: . opetie.d the way. She gave us the right to make
; : the fight our own. Such it is destined to be. The
Maine cannot be thrust aside. Its bleaching bones
-.and the manner in which they were sent to the bot
tom of Havana harbor constitute the great issue. Our
;: â â¢rmirdcred dead call for redress. It is cheering to see
. flie-Californian Senator grasping the situation and not
;: â¢â ; .backward about expressing his views, even though
these may conflict with that peculiar idea which holds
â¢ of the Maine to have been a thing to
: . be forgotten, and the pangs of Cuba the only appeal
to: our intervention and our force of arms.
ThJE MASONIC FESTIVAL.
/. .T~Z^ ROM the progress that has been made in pre-
I paring for the Masonic festival to be held early
in May ample assurances are given that it will
. . be.o-ne of the most successful entertainments of the
;. k-nd -ever held in the State. A warm interest is
[> taken in the enterprise by the entire Masonic fra
;t;rr;!y throughout the commonwealth, and there will
; â :.';b.eno lack of energy, skill or taste in promoting it.
'.' .As the object of the festival is to raise funds for the
." : ;,:e i ?.tiih!ishment of an institution of education and ben
i-â¢"; fcyqfence, which will be an important addition to the
: ; fiiirlier charitable foundations of the State, it is de
scrying the attention and th. help of the people gene
â¢;. rally , as well as of the organization having it in
. charge. Even when considered as a festival merely,
Avi-thout regard to the object for which it is desig
nated, it merits cordial co-operation, for it will add
â¢ much to the joy of the May in San Francisco and
'.';. 'r ;.give to our people and our visitors an opportunity
â  â â ,-â ; for a week of genuine delight. California is much
: . -ivep to festivals of this kind. They are held all over
: . the- State and at all seasons of the year, and consti
..â¢â ; tine one of the salient features of our social life.
;â ; â  ; . -j'vyery county and almost every town and village has
:.::;>â¢ .<a"ne or more to gladden the lives of its people and
: ;.: attract visitors during the springtime and early sum
... rn.er. Common as they are. however, they never be
â¢...y.come flat, stale or unprofitable. We can never have
â  'â _:". tea many of them. It will neither hurt us at home
; â â¢';.â â- nor our repute abroad to make California a land of
,: r an uninterrupted succession of festivals.
. : We have a climate and soil that furnish flowers for
..-.:â¢. -joyous fetes all the year round, and we have a people
'â¢'..capable of appreciating the advantages which nature'
â¢;â¢' has thus bestowed. It is right that we should make
c of this source of pleasure to add to our accom
â¢ pHshments in the works of benevolence to which we
â¢.re called. For that reason we can all of us look for
â -â¢.-.. ward with gratification to the Masonic festival as to
-. an opportunity to have a week f revelry ourselves
and to p.id in promoting through a great organization
.' the welfare of widows and orphans for all time to
.'â¢â¢ come.
. Â;â .â¢ According to an evening paper the Maine Board of |
â¢ â¢'â¢ Inquiry did not fix responsibility for the loss of that j
,:;. ; ship. This depends somewhat upon the degree of in
â ;â¢ telligence exercised in contemplation of the verdict.
.; -.To a man with brains it would appear that a ship an-
V chored by Spanish orders over a Spanish mine by the
: explosion of which it was blown to flinders could
with justice be reckoned against Spanish account.
Insurance companies have refused to pay the in
surance of a man who was so completely blown to
bits in an explosion that no fragments could be found.
Of course their theory is that he went up somewhat as
if in a chariot of fire, and that it did not hurt him
nny. There have been theories both more logical and
.'.' more honest.
." â¢' It is cheering to observe that the ministers are
â â¢ frank enough to say from their pulpits that the time
for Spain to get a licking seems to be here. These
â¢ gentlemen are not purely theorists. More than one
of them have carried army muskets, and they act as
though they would do it again if necessary-
Several Senators who had never been suspected of
having spines are acting as though their reputation
for bonelessness had been founded on an imperfect
4iaenosis. Even yet it is natural to fear a collapse.
OUR INTERESTS IN CHINA.
WHILE the Spanish controversy occupies the
first place in our attention at this time and
will rightly engage all of our national energies
until atonement has been made for the wreck of the
Maine, it must not be overlooked that in all proba
bility the larger destinies of our people will be more
affected in the long run by what is being done in
China than by anything likely to occur in the West
Indies.
Cuba is but a small island. Spain is a decadent
kingdom, and but little can be expected from either
of them in the future; but China is a vast kingdom,
whose trade is growing by leaps and bound*, whose
power of consuming American goods is almost inex
haustible, and whose commerce is inseparably bound
up with the development of the Pacific Coast.
The American people have been too long neglectful
of the present value and future possibilities of the
Chinese trade. The nations of Europe have been
wiser. They have seen that the accession of 400,000,
000 of people to the markets of the civilized world
means the expansion of commerce on an enormous
scale, and several of them are now almost at war
with one another in their eagerness to obtain points
of vantage for trade with the great empire. There is
reason to fear that if either Germany or Russia gains
supremacy in the ports of that country restrictions
will be placed upon our trade with the people and our
interests seriously compromised.
Our Consuls in China have given us fair warning
of the danger that threatens, as well as of the splendid
possibilities for trade if we are vigilant and energetic
in promoting it. Consular Reports for March con
tains a report from Consul Fowler of Chefu giving
an account of our trade with that province of China,
which is now the scene of German occupation, and
much of it is of particular interest to California. The
Consul states there is a growing demand there for
butter, cheese, milk, canned vegetables, meats of all
kinds, imitation gold watches, clocks, sewing ma
chines, wines, beer, whisky, flour, oil and cotton
goods. It will be seen that of this list California
could furnish almost all, and for many of them there
is now an urgent need for a larger market than the
State possesses.
It is, however, in the wheat and flour trade that the
largest field is open. Consul Johnson of Amoy re
ports that with an increase in the price of silver
"China would afford an almost unlimited market for
American wheat." This is borne out by reports from
all who have made a study of the situation in the
Orient. The Chinese are becoming a race of wheat
eaters, and it will be largely our own fault if they
obtain the wheat from Russia instead of from this
country.
In the very nature of things the expansion of Cali
fornia commerce must be westward rather than east
ward. Heavy freight rates impose a tax upon our
trade beyond the mountains, but to the West we have
the open, unmonopolized ocean for a highway. In
the Eastern States we have to meet rivals in all kinds
of manufactured goods, and in most kinds of orchard
and farm produce, but in China we have a natural ad
vantage over all competitors. Europe is now holding
that market by reason of subsidized ships and mili
tary aggression, but it can be made ours if the Gov
ernment at Washington will take steps to promote
American shipping as it does American manufactures
and guard our interests in the Orient as it ought to
guard them everywhere.
THE FLOOD SEASON IN THE EAST,
BY the fearful disaster which swept away a
village along the banks of the Ohio in Illinois
the Eastern people are made aware that their
spring has returned, the snows are melting, the frozen
rivers have changed from ice to living waters, and the
tornado and blizzard season has given place to that of
freshets and floods.
It is but a short time ago that we in California
were called upon to sympathize with the dwelle-s in
a portion of the East swept by a blizzard that after
freezing several States in its onward rush wound up
by doing damage to the amount of $2,000,000 in the
single city of Boston, and now we must prepare for
our annual commiseration of all who live anywhere
near the Mississippi, the Missouri or the Ohio. We
hardly have time to enjoy our Pacific Coast happiness
because we are so frequently, called upon to be sorry
for dolorous disasters beyond the Rockies.
It might be wondered why there is not every year
a large exodus of people from the blizzard-blasted.
flood-devastated East to this land of perennial sun
shine and mildness, were it not so well known that
men of all minds choose the ills they have rather than
fly to others they know not of. The average Easterner
is persuaded that California is very close to Hades,
that earthquakes are frequent, and that every hot
spring boils up. with brimstone fumes from the pits
of Tartarus. He prefers to take his chances with
roaring winds and raging rivers to coming to a land
which he believes to be at all times in danger of being
swallowed up in the abysses of the earth.
Our recent temblor, which served the excel
lent purpose of testing our tall buildings and
proving their security, while shaking down
a Government structure *or two and giving
us an assurance of another appropriation from
the national treasury to put money into circula
tion here, has been exaggerated in the East to some
thing terrible. Yet more destruction was done to
property and more lives swept away by the rampage
of the Ohio along the Illinois line on Sunday than by
all Californian earthquakes put together. The earth
quake, in fact, is a bugaboo, but the blizzard and rhe
flood are dire realities.
From the region where pursuit of the train robbers
is in progress arrive from time to time cheering re
ports that the bandits are surrounded. It is a custom
of the sleuth to "surround" his game, creep warily up
to it and find that it is not there. In this matter of
being caught the game declines to play a passive part.
It is interested more in getting away than the posses
could possibly be in not letting it get away. When
there was an open season for Evans and Sontag, it
will be remembered that the pair were "surrounded"
so often that the daily account which failed to in
clude this particular was considered incomplete .
It is not too much to say with the utrost confi
dence that, if the Spanish diplomats who are calcu
lating on a rebellion in the Southern States to assist
them are not a lot of fools, the symptoms they mani
fest are misleading.
Mrs. William Schuld goes to the trouble of explain
ing that while she has six times attempted to commit
suicide she will never, never do it again. The tendency
to beg of the lady not to be discouraged is too strong
to be repressed.
Constitutional provisions are said to be in the way
of the ruler of Spain disposing of Cuba. It will be
borne in mind, however, that this country does not
fed particularly bound by the Spanish constitution.
THE SAN FEANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 5, 1898.
DISHONESTY IN STREET WORK-
CITIZENS who pay taxes have a right to de
mand that their money shall not be wasted. It
is their intrinsic right also to suppose that the
officials given authority to expend money collected
from property-holders shall be reasonably honest. If
this money, instead of being devoted to public im
piovements, is parceled out among contractors who
give no adequate return, or sticks to the fingers of
Supervisors, surely they have the privilege of mak
ing protest
For several days The Call has been engaged in
showing that the money presumably devoted to pav
ing is not honestly expended. It has shown that
favored contractors have been permitted to begin
work without having bid for it, and that the work
has not been properly performed. Alamo Square
serves as an illustration. Here the work was done
without any bids having been called for. Naturally
the contractor found difficulty in collecting. Then at
this late hour, with the work, such as it was, com
pleted, bids were called for. As a matter of course
no new contractor could come in and make a bid
which would involve the tearing up of the work al
ready in place and compete with the original con
tractor. Nevertheless, one bid was lower than that
of the Street Committee's favorite. This would never
do; it would lead to exposure. So the lower bid, by
some hocus-pocus, was knocked out.
On a portion of Third street a contract has been
let to Flinn & Treacy, in which they are to be al
lowed more for paving than is to be allowed for. a
portion of Market street; yet in the former case there
is a lot of bitumen which is generously thrown in by
the city, and the concreting is already done. On
Market street the contract includes the concrete, and
the contractors furnish all of their own material. Why
this difference? The answer can come only from the
Street Committee of the Supervisors. This com
mittee has full charge of such improvements. The
Superintendent of Streets is merely an executive offi
cer carrying out its instructions. Where there is
crooked work of the sort of which these examples are
samples, this committee is responsible. Members of
the committee have chosen to ignore their obliga
tions to be honest. The proof has in part been pub
lished. There is more of it to come. While general
curiosity has been excited, there is one body em
powered to put questions and demand answers. Ref
erence is had to the Grand Jury. There *an be no
excuse for the flagrant violation of the trust imposed
upon this particular committee of the Supervisors.
Yet whatever they may say will receive all the atten
tion it deserves. The Street Committee of the Super
visors is as rotten as some of the pavement put down
by its orders. No statement could well be more em
phatic. The public desires to know if there is not
some remedy for this state of affairs, if swindling is
to be tolerated because done under the color of law,
or if plain violation of the statutes cannot be checked
when the violaters have been exposed.
A CHANGE IN JURY DRAWING.
THE change in the method of drawing juries
suggested by Code Commissioner Shanahan in
a recent interview should receive full considera
tion at the hands of bench and bar. The plan he pro
poses is to place the names upon the jury lists en
tirely in the hands of the Superior Judges, each name
being represented in the clerk's box by a number.
When, in impaneling a jury, a number is drawn, the
court itself is to identify and announce the name.
Mr. Shanahan and his fellow-Commissioners think
this system will effectually prevent the manipulation
of the jury lists. Somebody must be trusted with the
names of jurors, and it is the opinion of the Code
Commission that no better persons can be found
than the Judges of the courts.
It is not difficult to concur in this theory. Judges
are generally men of sound education. They are well
versed in the art of reasoning, and they understand
the importance to litigants and themselves of having
legal disputes fairly tried and adjudicated according
to the rules of law. As a general thing they are high
minded men and desire to see the law honestly ad
ministered. If the jury lists are to be intrusted to
anybody, therefore, it is quite probable that the Su
perior Judges will be their safest custodians.
A great deal of the complaint that is made con
cerning jury manipulation is due to the fact that the
names of jurors are drawn by county clerks or their
deputies. These officials are usually politicians, and
whether they are honest or not there is always a
suspicion that they will, either through neglect or
design, permit unscrupulous lawyers to tamper with
the jury lists. Probably in ninety-nine cases out of a
hundred there is no foundation for the charge that
juries are fixed. It is the habit of disappointed liti
gants to charge not only juries, but Judges, with cor
ruption. No matter how unjust causes may be liti
gants are, as a rule, unable to perceive that they are
in the wrong.
Nevertheless, this is a powerful reason for adopting
the reform suggested by Code Commissioner Shana
han. If the jury lists are placed in the hands of the
Judges, and the clerk is permitted only to draw num
bers, it will be difficult for anybody to manipulate a
jury through the County Clerk's office. At all events,
the suggested change should receive thorough con
sideration at the hands of bench and bar. Whatever
the lawyers and Judges decide upon will probably be
adopted by the Legislature.
MARKET-STREET IMPROVEMENTS.
A CORRESPONDENT, who commends the
course of The Call in opposing any extensive
expenditures for repaying Market street until
sewers and other underground works along the street
have been provided, directs attention to an im
provement which should be made at once without
waiting for the more elaborate undertaking. This is
the elevation of the eastern end of Market street to
the official grade, making it correspond with the side
walks along that portion of the thoroughfare.
Our correspondent points out that as the sidewalks
are on the grade fixed by the city, while the roadbed
has been left at its former level, the walks are about
two feet higher than the road. This is not only an
inconvenience to pedestrians, but in some respects is
positively dangerous, as the street is brought up to
the level of the walks by a very sharp angle, and in
wet weather the basalt blocks are slippery.
As the eastern end o? Market street is the point at
which the great tide of travel comes into the city, it
is manifest that the work of improving the thorough
fare should begin there. Moreover, our correspondent
is right in saying that an improvement consisting
solely in the elevation of the roadbed to the official
grade need not be made to wait for a complete and
comprehensive work of sewering and paving.
If any one should be injured by reason of the steep
decline from the level of the walks to that of the street

SVEN HBDIN IN THE HEART OF AS3A.
Havlnp solved the long locked mystery
of the Interior of the "Dark Continent,"
the exploration of Central Asia has be
come the principal object of Interest for
geographers.
The medial part of the Asiatic continent
embraces immense tracts of yet unknown
country, very difficult of access, the study
of which offers the greatest Interest from
every point of view.
Between Siberia and India on the one
part of the Trans-Caspian steppes and
the sandy deserts of Western China on
the other, the vast region stands like a
colossal fortress whose ramparts are
formed by the highest mountain chains
of the world. On the south is the enor
mous "relief" of Thibet stretching be
tween the high flanks of the Himalayas
the Karakorum and the Kuen-Luen
Mountains. To the north along the
southern frontier of Siberia the Thian-
Shan range stretches its mighty heights
to a length three times gTeater than that
of the Alps. On the west, in Afghanistan,
is the impassable Hindoo Koosh range.
All these find themselves united In the
mountainous mass of the "Pamirs," which
geographers havÂ£ justly denominated
"The Roof of the World." No other defi
nition could be so representative and so
suggestive.
In all this zone the numberless peaks
rise to extravagant heights. The average
altitude of Thibet is over 14,000 feet, while
many penks in and about it rise to double
that height, Yamlsankar and others on
the south going 1000 feet higher still.
This huge complex system of moun
tains separates the most powerful empires
of the world, Russia, China and the
Anglo-Indian. The natural routes from
Russian Turkestan to China are over the
passes of the Thian-Shan. while on the
crests of the "Pamirs" and the Hindoo
Koosh must be fought the coming duel
between England and Russia. A knowl
edge of this region is therefore of the
highest importance to statesmen as well
as geographers and naturalists, and
every step in its exploration must be
viewed with Interest by the general
public
On this account the very important ex

C. P. Huntington
yesterday, that
HOW THE
"GRIZZLY MINE"
TURNED OUT.
gentleman told the following rather good
story concerning a little mining venture
of his own which took place many year 3
ago.
"In all my business career," said Mr.
Huntinprton. "I have never had anything
to do with mines or mining stock, and the
only property of that character I have
ever possessed lias been force*! upon me
in payment of debts by men who had
nothing else to offer in the way of set
tlement.
'â¢I romrmber many years ago I became,
In this manner, the owner of a valuable
bit of mining property called the 'Griz
zley Flat Mine.' As soon as it came Into
my possession I looked around for a pur
chaser, and soon found one in the person
of the head of a new company which had
been organized for the purpose of de
veloping Just such property. I offered
the mine to this gentleman for the mod
est sum of $10,000. He refused to consider
it. Then I came down to $5000. He said
he had decided not to buy it at all. 'Yes
you will.' I said, 'when I tell you you can
have it for 5500." *I would take It that
price.' be answered. 'The Grizzly mina
pedition over the "Pamirs" and throned
Thibet, recently accomplished by Dr.
Sven Hedin, the Swedish naturalist, has
attracted great attention In European
circles.
Dr. Hedin's journey lasted some three
years and a half, during which lone peri
od his routes covered a large part of Cen- ;
tral Asia, crossed and recrossed them
selves on the Pamirs and the Hindoo !
Koosh. as well as on the sandy deserts of j
Chinese Turkestan, and then on through
Thibet to Peking, whence he turned back i
to the northwest and reached Europe \
again by way of Irkutsk and the Trans-
Siberian Railroad.
Choosing Russian Turkestan for his |
point of departure, the explorer reached ;
the foot of the Pamirs by way of Tas- j
kend early in I*o3. This region, fifteen j
years ago, by Mahometan fanaticism, was ,
closed entirely to Europeans, but since ;
then the Russians, with their Trans-Cas- j
plan Railroad and their marvelous way
of dealing with these most refractory
people, have brought them well under the
Influences of European civilization. As a
proof of this, among other things. Dr.
Hedin has a photograph of a dervish tell
ing the news to a group of his fellow j
Mussulmans against the wall of a mosque.
It is well known that the law of Mahomet
forbids its adherents from having their
features reproduced in any way. Dr. He
din has numbers of such photographs,
showing that tne religious sensibilities of
these natives are becoming less acute.
The assault of the "Pamirs" was begun
on the 23d of February. 1894. This quad
rilateral mountain mass Is surrounded by
mighty crests, some of whose peaks, as
that of Mustag-Ata, reach a height of
25.000 feet and more. Polar winter reigns
In these elevated regions until late spring,
and the cold was intense, 28 degrees C.
below zero on April 1.
This was not the greatest obstacle, how
ever. The "Mai de Montagne" (mountain
sickness) was terrible. The rarefaction
of the air made traveling painfully diffi
cult, often Impossible. Suffocation, nau
sea and vomiting, with intense headaches,
rendered the men incapable of exertion,
while the horses, not less sensitive to the
variations of atmospheric pressure, often
fell under their charges.
This extraordinary region has few In
habitants. The forms of the women In
a group photographed In front of one of
their habitations do not remind one of j
the Venus de Milo.
From the Pamirs, Hedin went through j
the Tarim basin and the Takla-Makan
resert to Lab Nor, the phenomenal lake !
which, filling with the sand driven by the
wind, the principal formative agent in
Uhis country, shifts its position from
time to time over a range of 100 miles
from north to south.
The Takla-Makan is a vast sandy soli
tude more desolate than the Sahara and
without oases or springs. No European
ever before attempted its passage. Re
tarded by sand storms In crossing it the
water supply gave out and two of his
men perished from thirst, while Dr.
Hedin himself was only saved from a
like death by his energy and will power.
Dr. Hedin afterward traversed the
mountain deserts of Thibet, living for
months at an altitude of 13,000 feet. He
replaced his horses with camels, which
with wonderful endurance drew his tar
antass, a primitive traveling carriage,
over the moving sands as well as the
mountain steeps with little or no food or
water for days at a time.
Reaching Peking on February 3. lS?7,and
resting for some time, Dr. Hedin again
turned to the interior, and crossing the
Mongolian deserts via Ourga and Kiachta
arrived later in the year at Irkutsk, and
returned with more comfort than he had
known for a long time to Sweden.
Is yours,' I replied, and the sale was
made.
"The company of which tho gentleman
was the head put up a mill and all the
other necessary adjuncts of a first-class
plant and started to work the property
under the name of the Grizzly Flat Min
ing and Milling Company. I lost sight
of the venture for several years, until
one day, meeting the purchaser of my
property on the streets, I asked him how
his property had come out. 'It came out
splendidly,' replied he. 'We sunk all the
money we could scrape together in put
ting up the necessary works for develop
ing it and after working it for a couple
of months and getting nothing but expec
tations, a cloud burst came along and
carried the entire plant so far out we
have never seen It since.' "

Oakland Office of San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 4.
The startling information leaked out to
<ib.y that the railroad company may take
the gates off the local trains if the fight
for street traffic patronago between the
Realty Syndicate and Southern Pacific
becomes more bitter.
The system of transfers between the
Broadway lines, owned by the Southern
Pacific, and the steam trains on Seventh
t commenced to-day. This move will
bo watched with great interest, as it has
b.ee.n furred mi the company owing to the
that they have no cross-town road
tv which to transfer, except the steam
. It Is well known that since the
ei;u. transfers with the lines of
â¢ the Realty Syndicate the business of the
. . l< .â â 'iid has fallen off con
rably, as passengers naturally patro-
Unes that transfer them all over
â¢ -town.
Southern Pacific has now begun is
g transfers from the steam trains to
the streetcars as well as the other way,
a; â ! the company expects thereby to get
back much, if not all, of its lust traffic.
.: .-11-was stated to-day by one in the em
: :. mpany that, if after a fair
â â¢tSial, the new transfer arrangement docs
: V.nut tome up to expectations the Seventh
:>.t.re<-t local will be again turned into a
and the gates will be taken off.
"â '. iiT; ite is just now connecting
Bast Oakland road with the Eighth
â  â  (Vest Oakland. This will
;- electric road clear across town
paralleling the steam road at only a
nee of one block. Passengers e<Jm
irig from Berkeley. Alameda, Fruitvaie
.my part of Oakland tan be trans
ferreS to the through Eighth-street lino
either way for one fare, and even with
transfers to the steam lines the railroad
is ;n a big disadvantage, for the trains
Only run every thirty minutes and every
huur after 7 p. m.. while the electric
car.- keep up a ten-minute travel.
. There will be considerable opposition to
any attempt to restore free travel on the
rc-ot line, although there has
always ijeen a desire en the part of many
.'.that the gates be removed. The Eighth
<-â¢:â¢â¢â  line is now the best-paying of all
the roads in the city, and free travel of
Seventh street would naturally draw off
a. ortion of the patronage.
-â â  thp syndicate held an
option on the Broadway lines, but did
not take it up, and it is believed that,
â¢ I the competition continue as un
*.y as at present, the Southern Pa
will be glad to dispose of Its two
. Â«.> out of the street railroad
business altogether in this city. The
t-\v<.rn statements of the company and the
arguments of E. Black Ryan, for the past
four years before the Board of Equaliza
tion, show that the lines have never made
a cent.
Tne question of the Southern Pacific
etreet railroads in this city will doubtless

moth electric plant to run the local

competitor the Southern Pacific Company
has ever encountered in Alameda County.

CANNOT FIND
A LOST ESTATE
Secret of Its Existence
Died With the Woman
Mason.
Belonged to Her Sister, Who
Expired In an Insane
Asylum.
Mrs. Salome Anderson's Death Ha*
Abruptly Ended Court
Proceedings.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 4.
Judge Ellsworth was forced to dismiss
a citation to-day that it was thought,
when issued, might lead to some sensa
tional testimony. The band of death,
however, has closed the case.
Several years ago a man named
Petzschler died and left an estate to his ;
widow. He had made his will some years
before his death, and bequeathed all his
property to his wife. After making the j
will, his wife became a lunatic and was
placed In an asylum. The husband de- i
clined to alter the terms of his will and
to make provision for a guardian, bo that
when he died, she was incompetent to i
manage the estate.
The sister of Mrs. Dorothea Petzschler i
was Mrs. Salome Anderson, who was \
known as the "woman Mason," and who ;
was buried a week ago. Mrs. Anderson,
hearing some years ago of the estate left ;
to her sister, and knowing her to be in
competent, applied lor letters of guard
lanshlp over her sister and her estate. !
These were granted, and Mrs. Anderson
took charge of the estate. Some time
later her insano sister died and no atten
tion was paid to the estate, as there was,
of necessity, no will. The property re- ;
mained in the name of Mrs. Anderson,
and was absorbed in her own personal
estate.
A few weeks ago the fact that Mrs.
Petzscnifr had left an estate was brought
to the attention of the court, with the in
formation that the guardian had rendered
no account.
Judge Ellsworth Issued a citation
against the "woman Mason" to show
what she had done with her dead sister's
property. The day after being served
with the citation, Mrs. Anderson died,
and no record of the lost estate can be
found, and it is said to bo impossible to
find out its exact value, or of wnat It con
sisted, or to segregate it from the Ander
son estate.
When Judge Ellsworth was Informed
by Attorney G. E. de Golia of the death
of the "woman Mason," he dismissed the
citation, and there is little hope now of
finding the insane sister's estate.
STOjuY OF MOFFETT'S Dr^D.
Mrs. Dora Guernsey Goes Into Hys-
terics at the Sight of the
Murderer.
OAKLAND, April 4.â Mrs. Dora Guern
sey, who swore to a complaint charging
Joseph 11. Moffett with the murder of her
mother, broke down and went into hys
terics this afternoon when Moffett came
into the Police Court. This was the first
time thr.t she has seen her stepfather
since the morning- he killed her mother.
She had to be taken from the room before
she could be quieted. Moffett covered his
face â with his hands and kept it so until
the woman was taken out.
Dr. O. D. Hamlin testified to finding the '
dead woman and the. defendant lying on
the floor of the back shed on the morn- '
Ing of March 17, and of their condition
at that time. Dr. R. F. Strauon. of the
Receiving Hospital, never heard the de- i
fendant make any statement of the shoot
ing, but said that ordinarily the wound
Inflicted by Moffett upon himself would |
have been fatal. Dr. S. H. Buicau testi
fied to holding an autopsy over the re
mains of Mrs. Moffett, and to the nature
of the wounds inflicted.
Mrs. Guernsey, who had become some- j
what composed, was called and sworn, j
When asked what relation she was to the i
deceased, she answered, "She was my j
mother," and gave way to her' grief I
again. She later related the talk between
her mother and Moffett the night before
the shooting, in which he claimed that
she was getting more money from the
Adeline street property than he. Mrs.
Moffett went into hysterics that night.
Next morning Mrs. Moffett arose first
and returned after leaving the bedroom,
but was not excited. She went to the
shed when the witness heard her scream
and two pistol shots. She ran back and
saw Moffett with a pistol In his hand.
He snapped it at her and she ran out
front. The witness then broke down
The case was continued until 9 o'clock
to-morrow morning.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 5, 189 S.
INVESTED IN
THE JUPITER
Widows Tell the Stories
of Their Lost For
tunes.
Promoter Blanding Explains
to the Court Where the
Money Went.
Expects Twenty-One Millions If He
Can Only Raise a. Few
Hundred.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 4.
The ghost of Winsor A. Kecfer, the
mining man who disappeared some
months ago to the great disappointment
of many speculative widows, has been j
hovering around Judge Greene's court
room. The court sat continuously from ;
10 a. m. to 5:30 p. m. to-day, allowing no
time for lunch, as it is anxious to get the
Ingalls case off Its calendar.
The case la a petition of the creditors j
of Sarah T. Ingalls to have Assignee
Charles F. Blanding removed and to have
a mortgage of $2000 set aside. Incident
ally widows tell of how they lost for
tunes through the representations of
Blanding and he talks of incorporating
the Jupiter Consolidated Deep Blue
Graved .Hydraulic Mining Company for
twenty-one millions as calmly aa though
he had the imaginary value of the mine
in hand.
Mrs. Nagle is an old lady. Before she
met Blanding she was wealthy. Now she
is a domestic and he holds her power of
attorney. She testified that some years
ago she lived East and was introduced by
Mrs. Dr. Newlands to Blanding, who was
then incorporating the Canfield Cannel
Coal Company. This venture fizzled out
and everybody lost all they had. Blanding
then conceived the idea of incorporating
the Jupiter mines, and he came west for
that purpose. He met Mrs. Ingalls and
with Mrs. Dr. Newlands and Mrs. Nagle
he got together $45,000, which he says he
expended in paying debts on the mine and
in buying claims of those who held title.
Blanding gave large blocks of stock in the
proposed incorporation to his clients, but
he has not yet incorporated, and Judge
Greene tried for some hours to find a
reason, but was apparently far from be
ing satisfied. A month ago Blanding tried
to sell a mortgage on Mrs. Ingalls' prop
erty that had been assigned to Mrs.
Nagle. As Blanding holds the latter lady's
power of attorney he was at liberty to do
as he pleased. As the mortgage is in dis
pute the attorneys for the creditors of
Mrs. Ingalls blocked the loan.
Mrs. Nagle told a very interesting tale.
She said she once had $40,000, but that
now Blanding had it invested for her and
she felt safe.
"He is an honest man." Bald the deaf
old lady, "and I believe I shall get every
penny back again when his schemes are
successful. I saw the coal mine, full of
beautiful shining coal, and I believe the
Jupiter to be worth $21,000,000, and I gave
Mr. Blanding my power of attorney and
left my business to him. and I signed
everything he brought to me to sign. I
know he acted for my best welfare, and I
am not sorry for anything I have done."
Blanding told of his transactions with
the ladies and said he intended to incor
porate under the laws of Tennessee as
soon as he had money enough to file the
papers at Nashville. He prefers Ten
nessee because stock is non-assessable
there. Judge Greene took the witness â¢â¢â¢
hand and drew from him the information
that his interest in the Jupiter mine is
confined to 210 acres. The claims of
the people to whom Winsor A. Keefer
sold part of the mines have not been ac
quired, and Blanding said he had three
old men living on the section he claimed,
and they are holding possession for him.
The claims of the missing man Keefer
were gone into at length by the court,
and it wanted to know, if he were dead,
who had his interests and if Blanding
ARRAYED AGAINST RUM.
DR. E. S, CHAPMAN, One of the Earnest
Members of the Anti-Saloon Crusade.
An anti-saloon crusade Is being revived in full force by the ministers of this
city, and for that purpose yesterday many of the clerev of the various denomi
nations met in the V. M. C. A. Auditorium to discuss the proposed campaign
against the evil of intoxication. Rev. J. N. Beard, pastor of Grace Ai. E. Church,
presided. Rev. E. S. Chapman was the chief speaker of the occasion. He is
pastor of a Congregational church in Oakland, and has been granted a leave of
absence for two months in order that he may conduct the crusade in the Inter
ests of the Anti-Saloon League.
Dr. Chapman, in the course of his remarks, referred to the hushing of party
strife, and to the uniting of all parties in support of the Government in its pres
ent crisis. It was desirable to secure the same union of religious and other ele
ments against the common enemy, the saloon.
"Participation in the crusade," he said, does not interfere with any man's
views, religious, political or otherwise, in that the only qualification of member
ship is opposition to the saloon. The motto of the movement is "The saloon must
go."
The chairman called for remarks byrepresentatives of different denominations.
Rev. E. A. 'Wood, pastor of the First Baptist Church, spoke for the Baptists;
Rev. H. C. Minton, D. D., for the Presbyterians; Rev. \V. A, Gardiner, pastor of
the West Side Christian Church; Rev. George Mooar, D. D., Congregational,
all heartily approving the work. Rev. W. S. Bovard, D. D., of the Methodist
denomination, offered a resolution indorsing the League, and approving of the
appointment of Dr. Chapman as superintendent of its work by the Anti-Saloon
League of the northern district of California. The resolution was adopted unan
imously by a rising vote. The meeting closed with a benediction by the Rev.
Dr. Chapman,
claimed them. The witness replied that
he had bought some and that he believed
his property was worth at least $21,000,000.
As soon as he had money he intended to
incorporate, and then the ladies would
receive interest on their stock.
Mrs. Ingalls. who is now insolvent, will
give her testimony in the morning. Some
time ago she met Blanding when she
owned some ranches at San Jose. She in
vested in Jupiter stock, on Blanding's
promise to incorporate "as soon as possi
ble." and now is seeking to have a mor* .
gage set aside that will save to her the
last piece or property that is left.

A long argument took place over the
proposal to remove the Tompkins School
to Castro and Ninth streets. Superin
tendent McClymonds made a long argu
ment in favor of the change, but his j
points were completely answered and
overturned by petitions and counter argu- I
ments and only Rowe voted for the ordi
nance, ten members indefinitely postpon
ing It.
Favor Wells for Schools.
OAKLAND. April 4.â The Board of Ed
ucation, in view of the Increase of water
rates, is considering the feasibility of tak
ing all its patronage from the companies
I and of sinKing wells. The matter was
I brought up at a meeting to-night and fa
! vorably received. Some of the schools
i have good well systems that were discon-
I tinued when competition arose. This
i measure would save many thousands a
year to the city.
Babbi Voorsanger on Revelations.
j BERKELEY, April 4.â Rabbi Jacob
Voorsanger of San Francisco lectured last
I night be fore the Unitarian Society at
I Stiles Hall on "Historical vs. Supernat
! Ural Revelation." He characterized as
j insufferable insolence the claims of va
! rious sects that their revelations are ex
clusive messages and necessary to sal
vation, and Included in one category the
three supernatural revelations of Moses,
| Christ and Mohammed. "The old Israel
i ite," he paid, "built a wall of exclusive
ness more insurmountable than the great
wall of China, the Christian sharpened
I his cross into a sword and held it at the
i throat of every unbeliever, and c Mo
hammedan started forth to save the
world by violence."
Berkeley News Notes.
BERKELEY. April 4.â William Ache
son, a brakerr.an on the local trains, while
I descending the steps of one of the cars
at 9 o'clock this morning to uncouple the
engine from the train, fell and struck
his head on the step, receiving an ugly
l scalp wound which necessitated the tak
1 intr of eight stitches.
The two-story residence of James E.
j Matthews at the corner of Baker and
i \iason streets. South Berkeley, was
i burned to the ground yesterday morning.
, The firemen could get no water, and their
: efforts to save the building proved futile.
| The building was valued at $3000 and the
insurance had recently expired.
The executive committee of the Asso
i ciated Students met at the university this
â¢ afternoon and decided to give notice to
the sophomores that any infringement
I on their part of the rule of the student
| body would be summarily punished. A
j meeting of the Associated Students to
j elect officers for the coming year will be
held on Friday. April 15.
Professor John Fryer, head of the de
! partment of Oriental languages at the

Impaling -was usÂ»d as a punishment
in Turkey up to is."s. The last men so
executed were four Arab sheikhs who
I had rebelled. They were impaled at the
four corners of the Bagrdad bridge. One
I of them lived for nine days.
WITNESS DUDY
WAS WARNED
Letter Received by Him
Is Produced in
Court.
Purported to Come From the
Office of the Chief of
Police.
Preliminary Examination of Theo
dore P. Haynes Continued Until
This Morning.
The preliminary examination of Theo
dore P. Haynes on the charge of murder
ing Lieutenant Burke, was to have been
continued before Judge Conlan yesterday
morning, but when the case was called
Attorney J. N. E. Wilson asked for a con
tinuance until to-day, as his associate at
torney, Mr. Sweeney, was unavoidably
detained in Sacramento.
Prosecuting Attorney Mogan vigorously
opposed a continuance on tne ground that
it entailed a hardship upon the witnesses,
but the Judge thougnt as no continuance
had been asked before the defendant was
entitled to it, so as to have the benefit of
both of his counsel being present. The
case was accordingly laid over until thia
morning at 11 o'clock.
Thomas Dudy, the witness examined on
Saturday, was present, and produced the
letter which he had received warning him
aa to the evidence he should give. The
letter was received by him on March 26
through the post, and is as follows:
We write this to you to warn you to stOD
you of giving so many false statements. We
have one statement already, and we do not
wish to hire you to give any statements to
people who come around there. We under
stand from your neighbors that you would
sell your whole family for whisky or beer. You
have varied In every statement you. have given
to bystanders. If we hear any more from you
we will lock you up and take your little cot
tage from you and show you no mercy. The
Idea of you saying the man Is Insane. We are
going to make you prove that. We have got
your name on the books, and if you refuse to
go to court we will kindly give you a free ride
and lock you up till the case Is over. Now,
Tom, take a friend's advice and keep your
mind to yourself, and for God's sake do not
drag your poor hardworking wife Into court,
for you have done it before. Your neighbors
speak very hard of you and say you are a two
face man. I remain. A FRIEND.
Will call and see you and give my name. By
order of Chief Lees.
No action was taken UDon the letter,
but it will probably be referral to when
the case is called to-day. The police are
inclined to look upon it as the production
!of some cranks who wanted to "josh"
Dudy, but tha view may not be taken by
I the Court, and the author may find hlm
i self in serious trouble If he can be discov
ered.

ROBBED OF

C. J. Hourihan Held
Up on Fourth
Street.

Pistol.
Thrilling Experience of a Sa

Footpads.
RELIEVED OF A LARGE SUM
Thinks Ho Could Identify the Mon
in Case They Are
Arrested.
C. J. Hourihan, who conducts a sa
loon at 625 Fourth street, was held up
by two masked men at the corner of
Fourth and Brannan streets early
Sunday morning and robbed of $220
and a gold watch and chain.
Hourihan closed his saloon shortly
after 3 o'clock and was on his way
home when he was stood up. Last
night he visited police headquarters
and gave a description of the robbers
to Chief Lees.
According to his story he was walk
ing along Fourth street, and when
near Brannan he was .accosted by two
men, one of whom thrust a pistol in
his face with the remark, "Shell out,
you , or I'll blow your
head off." Scarcely had he uttered
the threat when the second robber
proceeded to go through his pockets.
"You're up :ieainst it," he remarked
to the frightened saloon-keeper. "Re
sist and we will send you to the
Morgue."
While the robber with the pistol held
Hourihan in submission, his com
panion coolly searched his pockets,
taking all the money he had.
After satisfying themselves that
they had not overlooked anything of
value, the men ordered Hourihan to
"skip," under penalty of being riddled
With bullets.
The saloon-keeper, reaJizing that he
was in the hands of desperate men, at
once left the scene, and did not stop to
look back until he was several blocks
away.
Mef ting a police officer he told him rrt
his loss, and together they returned
to the scene of the hold-up. A few feet
away they found a black silk handker
chief, which one of the robbers had
used as a mask.
Hourihan believes tlmt the robbers
knew that he> had consiu^rmble money
on him and they determined to get it.
A short time before he closed his sa
loon two men, supposed to be the rob
bers, entered his Balooo and had sev
eral rounds of drinks. They remained
for about thirty minutes. Hourihan is
almost convinced that they are the men
who held him up. He describes one of
them as being abrmt 5 feet 10 inches in
height, medium build and having a
stubby, sandy beard. He wore a gray
suit ol clothes and was about 35 years
of age. HI? companion was rather
short and weighed about 150 pounds.
He had a sandy mustache and wore a
dark suit of clothes.
Hourihan claims that after the men
left the saloon they were joined by
another man who he thinks acted as a
lookout for his companions while they
â¢were holding him up. He describes the
third man as bÂ»!ng about 20 years of
age, with a smooth face and wearing a
dark suit of clothes. He is positive he
can identify them in case they are ar
rested.

Yesterday was a field day for Jobs
â¢la the Board of Supervisors. The Ala
â  no Square work was awarded to J. J.
.V. :I)owling at the figures of the "private
arrangement." The work was done so
Jong ago that the grass is growing over
v the curbs and the Supervisors now are
simply awarding a contract in order
to allow the contractor to get his money
. from the public treasury. No mention
.-.- was made yesterday in the board of
"W'indrem's bid which was lower than
Dowling's. The trick by which the
...Street Committee threw out the low
â  bid was not denounced. In discussing
'.â¢â¢â ; the matter of the work â Alamo
. Square Supervisor Britt asserted that
: . - : .the original contract was entered into
/ â ; on behalf of the city by the Superin
tendent of Streets. Mr. Ambrose, the
.'. Superintendent, distinctly denies that â 
. . : -he had anything to do with the letting
.'of the contract. He asserts that he did
: .' : not know* that any arrar cement had j
â  . been made to do the work until he saw !

.-"â¢/ The contract for repairing Third
ptreet, between Mission and Howard,
. â¢ 'went to Flinn & Treacy for $2100. J. J. ,
;JDowling at first proposed to do the
â¢ work for $950. but he was allowed to â¢
â¢.pull, out his bid for that sum and the ;
â¢ â¢.board instead of inviting new propo- '
; : â ; sals awarded the contract to the next
_.-; lowest bidder. Dowling's bid of $950
â¢. .was- a fair estimate of the value of the
.';. work, and material required for the re
'; .pairs. The space to be repaired was in

: statement which was accepted yester
..i day by the board to the effect that he '
bid for the work under a misapprehen
â . sion of the specifications is not borne
out by the palpable facts. He made his
"â¢-.calculations exactly on tl. â¢ line of the
â¢ V- specifications and even offered $75 for ;
. â â â¢â  the old material. Everything points to
...'the conclusion that Dowling's bid on
â¢ '"â¢the Third-street work was put in to
: ..;-'he"ad off low bidders. Had there been a
.' -bid lower than Dowling's or an inter
â â  "loping bid between the figures of Dowl
â¢ â¢ ing and those of Flinn & Treacy a way
;' would have been found to reject all the

,-.and. coarse â simply raw all the way
â¢. -through. In view of The Call's ex

â .â¢ the contract will be signed. It is said

on the improvement; hence an extra
fine Job of work is proposed.
The specifications call for a concrete
bed nine inches thick. The concrete is
to be formed of cement, sand and rock,
in this proportion: One part cement,
three parts sand and seven parts rock.
The space to be paved is about 100,000
Bquare feet. Considering; the specifica
tions and the fact that the work must
be kept in repair for five years at the
expense of the contractor, the price is
not high.
When the work is done the city will
have a Dolly Varden pavement on Mar
ket street from Second to Fifth. The
railroad company will retain the stone
block pavement between the cor rails
where the blocks are laid over an Iron
arch and bound together by cement.
The space between the tracks may be
paved with bitumen. In front of the
Emporium there is a wooden block
pavement, which his been accepted.
Permission has been granted to allow
a wooden block pavement in front of
the Phelan building.
It is said that Mr. McDonald, on gen
eral principles of reciprocity, has re
solved to give the city a fine sample of
his work in the proposed new pave
ment. He is closely identified with the
care and improvement of the streets.
He has the contract for sweeping the
streets, for which he draws down about
JII.OOO a month. Then he has some
kind of a private arrangement â or, at
least, the City Street Improvement
Company hasâ for repairing and p~ f ch-
Ing accepted streets. The little formal
ity of a contract or authorization by
some responsible party for doing this
work is "missing, but bills are rendered
and allowed just the same. It is.rough
ly estimated that these little side jobs
and the street sweeping enable the Im
provement Company to draw out of the
treasury something like $lf>o,ooo per
annum. When it comes to influence,
McDonald is " kingpin. The Super
intendent of Streets is not in his class.
PEACE IN CHINATOWN.
The Warring Tongs Compelled to
Cease Fighting.
The highbinder war which was on the
verge of breaking out in Chinatown Is off
find peace reigns among the Mongolians,
for a time at any rate.
The merchants of the See Yup Associa
tion held a meeting at the corner of Wav
erly place and Clay street last evening
for the purpose of averting the threat
ened trouble and succeeded in bringing
the warring factions to an amicable un
derstanding. The warlike feeling was be
tween the Sin Sue Ying and the Suey
Sing tongs, both of which are branches
of the See Yup Company. The Sin Sue
Ylnga are the ones who have the griev
ance, and the wounding of Lum Sier by
one of tluir men Wednesday night didn't
satisfy their grudge, so they have been
declaring they must have more blood.
Representatives from both the warring
factions were called before the meeting
of the association last night, and after
considerable parley, during which the Sin
Sue YingS vowed they would not stop the
tight, the merchants finally declared that
there must be an end of the fighting.
They issued the ultimatum that it after
their warning any shooting took place
they would notify the police of the where
abouts of the guilty parties and every as
sistance would be given the officers to se
cure arrests and conviction. Both tongs,
seeing that the merchants wore deter
mined, agreed to stop the fighting and no
further trouble is apprehended.
A FEAST FOB, ART LOVERS. Â«
Delorme's Interieur de Ferine Now
on Exhibition at the Emporium.
The "Interieur de Ferme," or farmhouse
interior, one of the famous Delorme col
lection of paintings and a companion to
"The Blacksmith." is attracting crowds
tn the second floor of the Emporium,
where it la on exhibition. The two are
alike and yet different. In "The Black
smith" the principal feature is the fire
light, while in the "Interieur" the slant
ing rays ot sunlight attract the eye first.
The former represents the workingman at
his trade, while the latter shows the home
of the working-woman.
The painting- is the property of F. E.
Galbraith of Toronto. Canada, owner of
the Delorme collection.
Injured by a Bear.
Frederick Louis, alias Goldman Smith,
an animal trainer at the Chutes, was
slightly injured yesterday morning in an
encounter with a grizzly bear. Louis,
who has charge of the performing bears
and wolves In the large exhibition arena,
entered the cage yesterday morning to
prepare the animals for the show, having
previously given the bear who afterward
attacked him a severe beating. In leaving
the inclosure he slipped and fell and
bruin, seeing his opportunity for revenge,
pounced upon him and sunk his claws
into the fleshy part of his leg, inflicting
several slight scratches. In trying to get
away from the claws of the enraged
brute Louis again slipped, this time
falling within reach of the bear's teeth.
The animal used them to advantage in
depriving the unlucky trainer of a small
fraction of the calf of his leg. He finally
succeeded in getting to the door of the
rage and out of the reach of the bear.
He spared no time in getting to a physi
cian near by, where he had the scratches
dressed and cauterized. The only part of
tlie performance that Louis did not seem
to relish was the fact that he was so
thoroughly shaken up, having dangled
from the teeth of the animal for about
four minutes.

TO HUMP THEMSELVES FOR THE FESTIVAL
Camels, Wonderfullg Caparisoned, Will Be Among the Marvels
of the Big Masonic Fete,
THE camels which are to be pro
vided for the children's amusement
at the forthcoming Masonic festi
val in aid of the Widows' and Or
phans' Home have all "been meas
ured for" their wonderful trappings, and
the caparisons of two are already quite
complete. As will be seen from the cut,
they are distinctly emblematic. After
the coverings had been adjusted in a
manner to please the fashionable outfitter
who has this matter in charge one of
them was placed in much the position the
camels take when the tiny passengers
are being seated in the safety cars which
will be firmly secured to the backs of the
animals, and the other stood beside him
while they were being sketched.
The arrangements for the comfort as
well as the safety of the little ones will
be satisfactory in every way. Not only
will the children be able to see all that
there is in the Pavilion without the
slightest fear of being crushed, but the
seats are to be so arranged that all may
see equally well, and ease in getting Into
LIEUTENANT
BENNETT IS
RETIRED
The Veteran Police
Officer Granted a
Pension.
Sergeant M. O. Anderson
Appointed in His
. Place.
Patrolman William Brophy
Received a Merited
Promotion.
PROBING BURKES DEATH-
The Men Who So Basely Deserted
Him Are to Bo Tried for
Cowardice.
The Police Commissioners met yes
terday afternoon as a pension board
and retired Lieutenant Bennett and
Police Officer Wells. Bennett has been
ailing for some time, and at his re
quest his name was placed on the pen
sion list.
Wells has been disabled for at least
a year, duo, It Is claimed, to a combin
ation of diseases. The Commissioners
at first decided to dismiss him from the
force, but as he had served the allotted
time, they finally agreed to retire him
on a pension.
Last night the Commissioners again
met and appointed Sergeant Anderson
of Captain Splllane's division lieuten
ant, to take the place of Bennett, re
tired. Anderson is one of the best
known men in the department, and has
a host of friends. To-day he will as
sume the duties of lieutenant of"' the
Potrero police station.
On motion of Commissioner Gunst
Police Officer William Brophy was
promoted to the position of sergeant.
Brophy has been connected with the
force for a number of years, and is
held in high esteem by his superior
ollicors. After his appointment was
made known he was warmly congratu
lated by his fellow-policemen.
For several reasor.s, the Commission
ers decided to postpone the appoint
ment of a successor to the late Lieu
tenant Burke until the next regular
meeting.
At that time it is expected they will
also appoint, two sergeants to the va
cancies caused by the dismissal of the
disgraced Sergeant Davis and the pro
motion of Sergeant Anders; n. It is
understood that Policemen Merrick and
Phillips will oe appointed. They have
the inside track, and having the con
fidence of the C mmissioners, their
promotion is almost assured.
After making the two appointments,
the Commissioners discussed the cow
ardly methods of the four policemen
who deserted Lieutenant Burke when
he was shot and killed by Haynes, the
murderous tinsmith. A diagram of the
cabin in which the murderer lived was
shown to the Commissioners, as well
as a drawing showing the positions of
the men who so cowardly deserted their
brave leader. Chief Lees explained the
diagram nnd also the positions occupied
by the officers when Burke was shot,
owing to the absence of President
Tobin, who is confined to his bed on
account of sickness, the Commissioners,
after a short discussion, decided to
postpone action until the meeting next
Monday night.
Part of Sutro's Property for Sale.
Judge Belcher made an order yesterday
and out of the cars will also have careful
attention. It Is the intention to provide
either skilled attendants to sit in the cars
or to allow mothers or sisters to take care
of the youngsters on their journeys
around the booths and floral gardens.
At first the larger of the two animals
seemed to resent being made to appear so
brilliant an object. He had watched the
fitting of his brother in his gorgeous
crimson clothing, and for awhile he show

FOUND A FATAL TOY.
A Ten-Year-Old Girl Placing With a Pistol Shoots
Herself.
WHILE playing with a revolver at
her father's home, SO Jessie street,
yesterday afternoon, Mary Antip
pa, the ten-year-old daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. Basil Antippa. accidentally
shot herself. The bullet entered over the
left eye, lodging In the brain. She was
taken to the Harbor Receiving Hospital,
where she died from the effects of the
wound without regaining consciousness,
and before the arrival of her parents,
who were away from home when the ac
cident occurred.
The father and mother of the little
girl own a candy and fruit stand near
the Cliff House and left her at home yes
terday while they went to their place of
business. A ten-month-old baby was
left In charge of the girl, and this child
was the only person present when the
fatal shot was fired, so just how it hap
pened is not known. The revolver was a
3s-caliber American Bulldog, owned by
the father and kept In a bureau drawer.
It is supposed that in the absence of
her parents the girl, child-like, had been
rummaging through the bureau, came
across the pistol and thinking it a good
plaything began to experiment with it.
A twelve-year-old brother of the girl,
who had been selling papers, returned
home about 3 o'clock and discovered hia
sister lying on the floor of the bedroom.

little girl weltering in her own blood and
in a dying condition. The policeman Im
mediately sent for an ambulance and had
the girl taken to the hospital. The doc

her, but despite their efforts she died an
hour after reaching the hospital.
A message was sent to the Cliff House
for the father and mother soon after the
child was found to be phot. They has
tened to the hospital, which they reached
a few moments after the little heart had
ceased to beat. They were prostrated
with grief at the sad occurrence and
blame themselves for having left the child
alone and for having kept the weapon

of it.
When the news of the death of the girl
was reported at Central Police Station
detectives were detailed on the case, as
It was thought some one might have
killed the child. A thorough Investiga

shooting and the officers are convinced
that It was purely accidental.
QUIET NIGHT
AT THE PLAY
"Shore Acres" Renews
Its Popularity at the
Columbia.
Anna Held's New Song â Cheap
Farce-Comedy at the
California.
"Bohemian Girl" Ones More nt the
Tlvoli â "Jane" Revived â Orpheum
and Morosco's.
"Shore Acres" came back last night
and with all Its old elaborate simplicity
pleased a fairly large audience at the
Columbia. I dare say this great Amer
ican pie and turkey drama never would
have come up for serious challenge
from persons who take the theater se- ;
riously had it not been for the fierce :
eulogies heaped upon it by Wil
liam Dean Howells and several dialect- !
fanciers, and for its author's custom of
employing his Sundays-off in preaching
sermons from the pulpits of tho
churches along the road. These eulo
gies and sermons â turned to glowing
account by the press agentâ were, from
tho managerial standpoint, immensely
fortunate in their result, attracting
thousands to- the play and investing it
with an air of high morality and noble
art not to be found in other secular
performances. Still there were some
few playgoers who looked beyond the
obvio-us goodnesses and kodakesque ex
ternals of Mr. Herne's play and failed
to find anything that was either moral
or artistic beyond what aiready had
been accomplished in the barnyard
masterpiece of Denman Thompson. I
dealt in some of this skepticism myself
when "Shore Acres" was played at the
Baldwin last year, but at the same
time, of course, credited Mr. Heine with
a more wholesale and, strangely
enough, a more convincing use o-f the
external tricks that had made the
success of "The Old Homestead."
The popular spell of both piays lies
wholly in the exaggeration of thÂ».Â»
commonplace, the skillful staging of
what are commonly taken for typical
phases of rustic American manners
and dialects. In neither play is there
the first symptom of dramatic thought
or invention. But if you go about
taking "Shore Acres" in the right
spirit, you need not depiore the ab
sence of these. The only really de
plorable thing in the whole piece is the
Morosco lighthouse sceue and its arch
episode wherein the Good Brother tells
the Bad Brother that he, too, loved the
present Mrs. Bad Brother years ago
in her single days, but had turned
away as a (Jood Brother should and
sacrificed himself. But for this third
act you might believe Mr. Herne,
author, to be the same simple, trust
ful rustic that beams in Mr. Herne,
actor.
The acting Is so much a part of the
play that it never has called for very
extensive comment. Mr. Herne has
reduced it to a question of mechanism,
which is admirably answered by him
self â a past master in rustic character
acting â and nearly all of his numerous
associates. His daughter, Miss Juli-?
Herne, plays the heroine this time, j
with some improvement on the dismal '
work of her predecessor, although sh<
is not entirely unacquainted with tho
"Hamlet's" Ghost intonation which
the author-manager seems to consider
a tradition of the part.
Taking "Shore Acres" at nothing
greater than its real value, It is a harm
less, finished performance of the most
unique qualities of tableau entertain
ment. At this period of its life you can
almost forgive Mr. Herne his
eulogists and sermons. If on th<
stage Anna Held had only lived
up to her milk baths as sin
cerely as Mr. Herne and his play have
lived up to his sermons, there would be
a different tale to tell In the Baldwin
box office. By the way, if Mr. Herne
should be asked to appear in any of the
local pulpits it will have to be for morn
ing service, as the Columbia engage

the Union Iron Works, will be launched
early in June and be ready for active
service early in August. This 240-ton
boat will have a speed of thirty knots

As examples of rapid work in ship
building the facts are cited that the Jap
anese cruiser Chltose was launched Janu
ary 22, 1888, and within sixty working days
thereafter the steamship St. Paul is to
be launched at the Mine slip. The Mauai
was launched November 27, 1597, and at
the same Blip the Senator was launched
March 19, ISM. The Senator will go to
sea April 27 and the St. Paul on May 10.
The keel of the Japanese cruiser was laid
on May 3. 1897, and the ship was launched
January 22. ISOS. It is said that this speed
in construction Is not surpassed in thÂ»
English shipyards. The battle-ship is
consin will be launched early next year
and finished within the time specified by
the contract.

REDDING, April 4.â One of the most
daring robberies in the history of Trin

about 11 o'clock Saturday night. There
were a dozen men in the Klite saloon,
when two masked robbers entered
through the rear door, and with drawn
revolvers compelled all the inmates to
stand with their faces against the wall.
The robbers took from the barkeeper,
Fred Mi'.lcr, a sack containing $3. r .O in
coin. Tiny then departed as suddenly
as they had appeared.
Both robbers wore masks of gray col
ored cloth. One of them is described as
being about five feet ten inches in height,
and the other was about an inch shorter.
There is no clow to their identity, but
the authorities are working upon the idea
thut the work was done by non-residents.

Kearny street.
Morris Colman was a married man,
but was divorced from his wife ten
years ago. She lives in the East. There
were two children by the marriage, his
son, Jerome, and a daughter, 17 years
old. who is visiting In the East now.
It is known that Colman was not in
need, although it is said that much of
the wealth which he had amassed had
slipped from his prasp. He left no let
ters nor written documents to account
for his act. Deputy Coroner Hallet
found his Jewelry and money in the
places where they were usually kept.
Charles Colman and his family were
greatly shocked by the news of the
sudden end of one who was near and
dear to them. They would not discuss
the suicide beyond stating that there
was, so far as they knew, no reason
why the unfortunate man should have
taken his life. When Jerome Colman
left his father yesterday morningr he
was in pood spirits, but It was only
shortly after the departure of the son
that the father took his life.
Â»he mystery that surrounds Colman s
death appears to hay.- no satisfactory
solution, although it can possibly be ac
counted for by his relatives, who refused
to tell the cause if they know. It may
have been the result of brooding over his
domestic unhappines!Â». for his divorce
from his wife was secured by Colman
upon the ground of desertion, she hay-
Intr rtin away with another man. Colman
was reputed by those who knew him best
to be a sober person and strictly temper
ate in all ways, and it Is not known that
he had nny "secret alliances thnt could
have caused him to commit suicide.
He was a Mason, and it was said pome
years ago attended the Jewish Temple
on Butter street. The remains have been
taken In charge by Charles Colman, but
the funeral arrangements have not yet
been made.
A Musical Library.
A department nf music has just been
added to the library of the Mechanics'
Institute. While at present largely- ex
perimental, it Is intended that it shall
eventually contain copies of the standard
sheet and folio music, instrumental and
vocal, and operatic scores, together with
books of Instruction and exercises for
the piano, violin, mandolin, guitar and
other instruments. The music will be
circulated on the same conditions as
books, and it is felt that the advantages
of such a department will be recognized
at once. Among the titles already in
cluded in the collection- are the scores of
"Lohengrin," "Tannhauser," "Carmen,"
"Faust." "Mlgnon," "Fidello" and sev
eral light operas, the songs of Lassen,
K.ierulf, Saint-Saens, Deiibes, Jensen.
Rubinstein, Schubert and Schumann, the
symphonies of Rubinstein, Mendelssohn,

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 5, 1898.
FOSTERING
THE GARBAGE
MONOPOLY
Supervisors Pass Res
dlution Abolishing
Scavengers.
Only Wagons Owned by
the Crematory Com
pany to Be Used.
Delany's Resolution for the
Relief of Cigar Dealers and
Saloon Men.
ATTRIBUTES IT TO DEVANY
A Joker That Would Exempt Their
Slot Machines From the Usual
License.
The Supervisors have finally passed the
resolution giving the Sanitary Reduction
Works the exclusive privilege of hauling
parbape to the crematory, and providing
that the city shall pay for the hauling.
The matter came up before the board a
week ago In the form of a resolution,
which was passed to print, setting forth
that some of the scavengers in this city
continued to dump garbage on the Mis
sion flats instead of hauling it to the cre
matory, as required by law, and In defi
ance of all sanitary regulations. The
resolution also affirmed that the present
method of hauling garbage was a menace
to health as the wagons used allowed
their contents to be scattered along the
Btreets. As a safeguard to the city's
health, it proposed a certain patented
wagon should be used, and that a suffi
cient tax levy should be made to provide
for the payment of hauling garbage by
the city.
The resolution, with its artful allusions
to the Board of Health, sanitary condi
tions and public welfare, was most allur
ing in its phraseology, and carefully con
cealed the fine hand of the reduction
works. But Investigation shows that
the company has exclusive control 01' the
wagons it is proposed to use, and that
COO scavengers will be forced out of busi
ness, while the monopoly will be paid by
the city for hauling garbage, in addition
to the 20 cents a cubic yard it now re
ceives for cremating it, whereas the peo
ple at present pay these 600 scavengers
a nominal sum monthly for hauling
refuse away.
Notwithstanding these facts were ex
plained to the board, a majority of the
members at yesterday's meeting voted for
the final passage of the resolution, and
it is now in the Mayor's hands for his
veto or approval.
Just before the adjournment of the Su
pervisors, Delany offered an innocent ap
pearing little amendment to the ordinance
licensing nickel-in-the-slot machines,
which, if passed, will exempt those in
genious devices used by cigar dealers and
saloonkeepers fmm the license of $3 a
quarter they now pay.
The resolution is amendatory to subdi
vision 4S, section 10 of Order No. 1559, and
is similar to the original order except that
it only includes: "Weighing, phonograph
ic, candy, chocolate, postage btamp. for
tune teliing. punching, lifting, electric
machines, etc," and provides that the
proprietor of each of the above named
machines: "Or any other machine or ap
paratus of any kind, character or descrip
tion, by which on a deposit of 3-cent piece
or any other piece of money or article
representing money, within said machine,
a person is weighed thereon, or services
are rendered, or music played therein, or
candy or any other of the articles
named above are received," shall pay a
license of $3 a quarter. No mention what
ever is made of the devices used In
saloons and cigar stands, which operate
on a different plan from any of the oth
ers, consequently no license would be ex
acted on them.
After the adjournment Supervisor De
lanv was asked for an explanation, and
said he had introduced it at the request
of Supervisor Devany, who. he said,
wanted to abolish the machines in use in
saloons and cigar stands, but having a
friend in the cigar business did not care
to Introduce it himself. Delany admit
ted that he had not examined the resolu
tion carefully, but expressed the belief
that it would effect the reform intended,
as the machines in question could then be
suppressed as gambling devices and with
out the pale of the law. The Supervisor
had apparently forgotten all about Judge !
Cook's recent decision, in which he dls- ,
tlnctlv expressed the opinion that they
were not gambling devices, and when his
attention was called to it he was consid
erably embarrassed, but finailv said the
resolution had not been passed yet.
The resolution empowering the Sheriff
to designate a sufficient force to properly
care for insane patients was indefinitely
postponed, as one of the members of the
board has somebody he wants appointed
to the place.
Smith protested against the passage V>
print of the resolution paving Market
street from Second to Fifth, with bitu
minous rock, but his protest was lneffec-
Britt's motion to reconsider the vote re
fusing to pay Contractor J. A. Hanley
J92.S 50 from the Street Department fund
for certain street work was carried and
the contractor's claim aliowed.
The request of the National Athletic
Club for a permit to hold prize fights on
April 20 and May 20 was granted. Brltt
votpd against it and was promptly called
down by Sheehan, so he changed his vote
to "aye."
The' San Francisco Gas and Electric
Company will have to surrender a portion
of its monthly demand. The Street Lights
Committee was authorized to arrange
with the company for the payments of its
monthly demands for the remainder of
the fiscal year on a basis of J23.ISS 23 per
rronth in order to keep within the unex
pended amount of the appropriation.
Mrs Wilhelmina Schuzzler's claim of
$400 oh a judgment in her favor against
the city for damages to her property,
caused by a defective sewer, was referred
to the City and County Attorney.
Bids were rejected for contemplated
street work at the corner of I street and
The Market Street Railroad Company
was requested to Inform the board
whether it would pave with bitumen that
portion of Market street it Is required by
law to care for in case the board award
ed a contract for paving the other portion
Â° Dodge called the attention of the Street
Committee to the resolution referred to it
last week, calling for certain information
from one of the electric companies that
desires to bid on the contract for lighting
public buildings and streets. The com
mittee was instructed to report yester
day but Rivers asked for another week's
time and It was granted him.

A MYSTERY OF THE SEA.
The Wreck of the Helen W. Almy Suddenly Disappears
From the Path of Navigation.
One more maritime mystery lies hidden
in the oeean"s cavernous depths. One
more ship has her bones strewn along the
beach and one more story of human
agony in engulfing wave will remain un
told until the sea gives up its dead.
Since that awful night, three weeks
ago, when thirty-nine souls wore hurried
into the presence of their Maker by the
foundering of the bark Helen W. Almy,
no word, no sign, no flotsam or Jetsom
has come to mortal ken that would give
any clew either to the manner of the
catastrophe or to the fate of those who
left with such high hopes of wealth to be
wrested from the ice-bound sands of
Alaska. Nothing remained to tell the
awful tale but the ghasttly hulk which
floated down with tides and currents until
held fast by its dragging chains in the
path of other vessels, as if not satisfied
with its terrible tragedy, it desired to add
further horror by lying in wait for some
other ship and dragging it down to the
depths in awful companionship.
For almost two weeks the mournful
sound of a tolling bell about six miles oft
from the Golden Gate has warned pass
ing vessels that danger lurked in their
path. It was the death knell rung by the
buoy placed to mark the spot where the
rotten hulk swung to and fro with wind
and wave until such time as the wheel

but either the wind or the tide or the
waves prevented the consummation of
the long contemplated and long deferred
action.
Yesterday morning, however, every
thing was ready, the elements were fav
orable, and the lighthouse tender Mad
rone, with Lieutenant Beattie of the Mon
terey and a squad of blue jackets, went
out to blow to atoms the waterlogged
hulk. But that Providence "which sits
up aloft and watches for Jack" had tired
of waiting, and when the tolling bell had
guided the tender through the fog to the
spot where the wreck had swung so many
days, there was consternation and dis
appointment among those on board the
Madrono, for not a sign of wreck was to
be seen, and It was only through an item
in The Call that any clew was had to
the disappearance. That item told of a
captain who had seen what he supposed
to be the wreck of the Almy drifting
along about two miles off Point Pedro.
Satisfied that the wreck had left its
moorings, search was made through the
fog along- the coast down toward where
it was supposed some trace might be

systematic search of the rocky and surf
beaten coast, and for ten miles every
cove, inlet and reef was carefu"y Inspect
ed, with the result that in one little
cove, guarded by jagged tocks and shel
tered by high, frowning cliffs, were found
tangled spars, cordage, timbers and other
debris showing that here the ill-fated
bark had struck and pounded to pieces,
still holding her secret from the prying
eyes of man.
That the wreck no longer menaces navi
gation there Is no doubt, for the wreck
age along the coast and the floating
debris showed only too plainly that the
waves had completed their work and left
nothing for man to do except to report
that his intervention was unnecessary.
Lieutenant Beattie had taken six heavy
charges of gun cotton and all the neces

wreck, but there was nothing for him to
do but return to the bell uuoy and have
it removed. This was done, and the

PRINTERS STILL
OUT ON STRIKE
Employers and Men Both
Appear Determined
to Resist.
The Largo Job Offices More
Inconvenienced Than
the Small.
A Speedy Settlement of Difficulties
Hoped For by All
Parties.
The strike of the book and Job printers
for a nine-hour workday was marked by
orderliness and quiet throughout yester
day. Police officers were stationed In
front of each of the offices where thera
had been a strike declared, but their ser
vices were not needed. Members of tha
strike committee were also stationed in
front of the buildings to watch all who go
in or out. The headquarters in the Hal
leck block have been filled with men all
day, but everybody was orderly and quiet.
A great part of the afternoon was taken
up In Initiating new members. Some of
these were apprentices who had volunta
rily walked out with the men. while oth
ers were men who had come to this city to
take the places of tho strikers, but
thought better of It afterward and cast
their lot with the union men.
Many of the larger offices decided to
shut clown for a day or two to watch the
outcome of the movement, while others
have small forces of non-union men work-
Ing. Good pressmen, either In or out of
union circles, are hard to find, and the
absence of these cripple the proprietors
as much as anything else. The proprie
tors claim that they had more applica
tions for work than they could possibly
till, and were turning men away all day,
but few of them have more than one-fit'lh
the usual force at work. They rushed
things all last week, working night and
day to finish what was on hand as it i 3
almost impossible to find men familiar
with the routine of work of the establish
ments who can stop in and fill the places
of the strikers. The shops will practical
ly remain closed until the strike is decid
ed one way or the other.
The union is carrying on an aggressive
fight by the old time-honored I. T. U.
method of visiting merchants and re
questing them to carry their patronage to
the offices which have signed the new
scale, and have been very successful in
their efforts.
"Wo think this is the best plan," said
President Hawkes yesterday. "There are
enough union offices in this city now to
do all the local work, if they were pushed
to anything like their full capacity, and
we have been repeatedly requested to
place orders. This afternoon the adver
tising manager of one of the largest de
partment stores In the city telephoned
down to us and asked for a list of the
'fair' offices, stating that he was about to
issue his spring catalogue and wanted to
be sure it would go to a good union office.
Other similar requests have come in from
outside sources and we regard them ns
encouraging. I do not believe the strike
will last over a few days at the furthest,
although many of the small shops^ or
"one-man offices,' may hold out for an ai
most indefinite length of time. I think
from the reports received to-day that
ranny of the big concerns have already
weakened, and that the morning will see
many of our men at work."
The proprietors take a very different
view of matters. They one and ;ill laud
the management of the union for the gen
tlemanly way in which matters have been
carried on so far, but they think the de
mands of the union un.iust. as they say It
would throw them int> unfair competi
! tion with the East, owing to the high
freight charged on paper. Many of them
suggest that a compromise might be ef
fected, and all are willing to employ union
men If they will go back at the old scale.
They report applicants for work from the
outside as plentiful.
A great many "rats" appeared at head
quarters yesterday and applied for money
i with which to leave town, but all were
: refused. The union has decided to offer no
! bribes, as it is confident of winning with-
The strike committee and "chapel dad
dies" will be at the rooms all day to-day,
and men have been told off to the various
districts to see that quiet Is maintained.
No groups are allowed to collect anywhere
outside the union rooms, where the union

tary of Board of Public Works.)
Said warrant, assessment ;md dia
gram shall be recorded in the office of j
the Board. When so recorded the sev- !
eral amounts assessed shall be a lien i
upon the lands, lots, or portions of lots
assessed, respectively for the period or
two years from the date of said record-
Ing, unless sooner discharged; and
from and after the date of said record- -
ing t>f any warrant, assessment and
diagram, all persons interested In said ,
at,s< wsment shall be deemed to have no- i
tice r -f the contents of the record [
tneieof.
After paid warrant, assessment and
diagram are recorded, the same shall i
ba delivered to the contractor, or his
agent or assigns, on demand, but not
untii after the payment to the Board
of the incidental expenses not previ- ;
otisly paid by the contractor or his as- j
signs. By virtue of said warrant said j
contractor, or his agents or assigns,
shall be authorized to demand and re- j
ceive the amount of the several assess- j
ments made to cover the sum due for
the work specified in such contracts
and assessments.
When it shall appear by the final
judgment of any court in this State
having jurisdiction to render such Judg- i
nient, that any suit brought to foreclose I
the lien of any assessment for street
work made under this Chapter, or in
the recording thereof, has been defeated
by reason of any defect, error, infor- j
malily, omission, irregularity, or ii!e- j
BR*ity, thereof or therein, or in the re- |
turn on the warrant issued pursuant to |
any such assessment, or in the record- {
ing of any such warrant, any person in- |
terested therein may, at any time with- j
Iti seven months after the entry of said j
final judgment, apply to thÂ« Hoard for j
aroiher assessment to be issued in con- \ ,
formity to law; and the Board shall. I'
within sixty days after the time of
said application, make and deliver to j
said applicant a new assessment, dia- i
gram and warrant in accordance with
law, and sign, record and authenticate '
the same as above provided. Such as- j
sessment shall be a lien upon the lots :
of land set out therein for the period of !
two years from the date of its record- ]
ing, and suit may be brought to enforce i
said lien as provided in this Chapter.
Should such final judgment be that of
the Superior Court for the City and j
County and an appeal therefrom to the
Supreme Court of the State has been
taken, no such other assessment shall
be made until said appeal has been de
termined.
Sec. 13. The contractor or his as
signs, or some person on his or their i
behalf, shall call upon the persons as- i
sessed, or their agents, if they can con
veniently be found, and demand pay- i '
ment of the amount assessed to each.
If any payment be made, the contrac- i
tor, his assigns, or some person on his I
or their behalf, shall receipt the same!
upon the assessment in the presence
of the person making such payment, !
and shall also give a receipt if demand- ! !
cd. When the persons so assessed, or j
their agents, cannot conveniently be J >
found or when the owner of the lot is I
stated as "unknown" upon the assess- |
ment, then said contractor or his as
signs, or some person on his or their i
behalf, shall publicly demand payment â¢
an the premises assessed.
The warrant shall be returned to the
Board of Public Works within thirty .
3ays after its date with a return indors
ed thereon, signed by the contractor or ' â¢
hie assigns, or some person on his or j ,
their behalf, verified upon oath, stat
ing the nature and character of the de
mand, and whether any of the assess- t
ments remain unpaid in whole or in i j
part, and the amount thereof. There
upon the Secretary of the Board shall
record the return so made in the mar
gin of the record of the warrant and
assessment.
The Board can at any time receive
the amount due upon any assessment
and warrant issued by it and give a
good and sufficient discharge therefor;
but no such payment so made after
suit has been commenced shall operate,
without the consent of the plaintiff in
the action, as a complete discharge of
the lien until the costs in the action
shall be refunded to the plaintiff.
The Board may release any assess
ment upon the books of Its office on
the payment to it of the amount of the
assessment with interest against any
lot or on the production to it of the
receipt of the party or hla assigns to
whom the assessment and warrant
were issued. If any contractor shall
fail to return his wan-ant within the
time and in the form provided in this
i section he shall thenceforth have no
lien upon the property assessed; but if
any warrant is lost, upon proof of Buch
loss a duplicate may be Issued, upon
which a return may be made with the
same effect as if the original had been
so returned. After the return of the
assessment and warrant as aforesaid,
all amounts remaining due thereon
shall draw interest at the rate Of seven
per centum per annum until paid.
Sec. 14. The owners, whether named
in the assessment or not, the contrac
tor or his assigns, and all other per
sons directly interested in any work
provided for in this Chapter, or in the
assessment, feeling aggrieved by any
act or determination of the Board of
Public Works in relation thereto, or
who claim that the work has not been
performed according to the contract in
a good and substantial manner, or
having or making any objection to the
correctness or legality of the assess
ment or other act, determination, or
proceedings of the Board, shall, within
thirty days after the date of the war
rant, appeal to the Supervisors, by
briefly stating their objections in writ
ing and filing the same with the Clerk

and place of the hearing, briefly re
ferring to the work contracted to be
done, or other subject of appeal, and
to the acts, determinations or proceed
ings objected to or complained of, shall
be published for five days. Upon such
appeal the Supervisors may remedy
and correct any error or informality
in the proceedings, and revise and cor
rect any of the acts or determinations
of the Board relative to said work,
may confirm, amend, set aside, alter,
modify or correct the assessment in
such manner as to them shall seem
just; and require the work to be com
pleted according to the directions of
the Supervisors, and may at their op
tion direct the Board of Public Works
to correct the warrant, assessment or
diagram in any particular, or to make
and issue a new warrant, assessment
and diagram to conform to the deci
sions of the Supervisors in relation
thereto.
All the decisions and determinations
of the Supervisors, upon notice and
hearing as aforesaid, shall be final and
conclusive upon all persons entitled to
appeal under the provisions of this
section, as to all errors, informalities
and irregularities, which the Supervis
ors might have remedied and avoided;
and no assessment shall be held in
valid, except upon appeal to the Su
pervisors, as provided in this section,

defect in the proceedings prior to the
assessment, or in the assessment it
self, where the Board of Public Works
has acquired jurisdiction to make the
same.

of thirty-five days from the day of the
date of thfÂ» warrant, or if an appeal

rant, assessment and diagram, or any
day thereafter during the continuance
of the lien of said assessment, and re

remaining unpaid, with interest there
on at the rate of seven per centum per
annum until paid.
In all cases of recovery under the
provisions of this Chapter the plain
tiff shall recover the sum of fifteen dol
lars in addition to the taxable costs,
as attorney's fees, but not any percent
age upon said recovery. When suit has
been brought, after a personal demand
has been made and a refusal to pay
such assessment so demanded, the
plaintiff shall also be entitled to have
and recover said sum of fifteen dollars
as attorney's fees in addition to all tax
able costs, notwithstanding that the
suit may be settled or a tender be
made before a recovery in said action,
and he may have judgment therefor.
Said warrant, assessment and dia- j
gram, with the affidavit of demand and
non-payment, shall be held prima facie !

ness of the assessment and of the prior j
proceedings and acts of the Board of
Public Works and of the Supervisors.

and diagram are based, and like evidence
of the right of the plaintiff to recover in i
the action. The Court in which said suit i

ling such of the streets of the City and
County as the Board shall determine
should be cleaned and sprinkled at the
public expense. Before causing notice
for such proposals to be published the
Board shall divide the City and County

judgment will best induce competition
for bids, and secure the cleaning and
sprinkling of the streets at the lowest

of the President and Secretary of the
Board of Public Works, and he shall
take the written receipt, indorsed upon
said order, of each person to whom
any delivery is made, specifying the

ARTICLE XII.
ACQUISITION OF PUBLIC UTIL
ITIES.
It is hereby declared to be the pur
! pose and intention of the people of the
I City and County that its public utilities
i shall be gradually acquired and ulti
! mately owned by the City and County.
, To this end it is hereby ordained:
SECTION 1. Within one year from
i the date upon which this Charter shall
'â¢ go into effect, and at least every two
| years thereafter until the object cx
i pressed in this provision shall have
'â â  been fully attained, the Supervisors
! must procure through the City Engi-
n eer plans and estimates of the actual
cost of the original construction and
completion by the City and County of
water works, gas works, electric light
works, steam, water or electric power
j v/orks, telephone lines, street railroads
' and such other public utilities as the
Supervisors or the people by petition to
the Board may designate.
In securing estimates of the original
cost of the construction and completion
i of water works by the City and County,
! the Supervisors must procure and place
â  on file plans and estimates of the cost
of obtaining from all of the several
available sources a sufficient and per
manent supply of good, pure water for
the City and County, in order that
propositions for the acquisition, con
struction and completion thereof, and
the incurring of municipal indebtedness
therefor, may be submitted to the elec
tors of the City and County as herein
after set forth.
Sec. 2. After such plans and esti
mates shall have been procured and
filed, the Supervisors shall, at as early
a date as they may deem for the best
interests of the City and County, enter
i into negotiations for the permanent ac
j quisition by the City and County, by
original construction, condemnation or
purchase of such or any of said
| public utilities as they may regard
I most important to the City and County
! to be first acquired, and to formulate
! and submit to the electors of the City
! and County, at a special election, prop
| ositions for the permanent acquisition
i and ownership thereof?
Before submitting propositions to
! the electors for the acquisition by orig
inal construction or condemnation, of
j public utilities, the Supervisors must
I solicit and consider offers for the salo
I to the City and County of existing util
ities in order that the electors shall
have the benefit of acquiring the same
' at the lowest possible cost thereof.
Sec. 3. When a petition or petitions
' signed by electors of the City and
County equal in number to fifteen per
centum of all the votes cast at the last
preceding general election shall be pre
sented to the Supervisors, setting forth
that the signers thereof favor the ac
quisition by the City and County of any
public utility, and requesting the
Board to prepare for submission to the
electors of the City and County, as
hereinafter provided, a proposition for
the acquisition of such utility, it shall
be the duty of the Board to immediate
ly take such steps or to enter into such
negotiations as will enable it to formu
late such a proposition for submission
to the electors as aforesaid. Such prop
osition shall be so formulated and com
pleted within six months from the data
of the filing of such petition. The Clerk
of the Supervisors must, immediately
upon the filing of the aforesaid petition
or petitions, after examining and veri
fying the signatures thereto, transmit
an authenticated copy thereof, without
the signatures, to the Board of Election
Commissioners, and another such copy
to the Mayor, together with a certifi
cate that the required number of signa
tures are appended to the original. The
Mayor shall also have the right to for
muiate and submit to the electors &
separate proposition from that formu
lated by the Supervisors for the acqui
sition of the utility named in said pet!
tlon. At the next municipal election af
ter the formulation of such proposi
tions by the Supervisors ard the May
or, the Board of Election Commission
ers shall submit to the electors the two
alternative propositions. The proposi
tion receiving a majority of the votes
cast thereon shall be adopted; but In
case ihs votes cast In favor of both
17propositions shall not exceed one-half
the total number of votes cast thereon,
both propositions shall be deemed re
jected.
Nothing In this section shall be so
construed as to prohibit the Supervis
ors from responding to the aforesaid
petition of the electors requesting the
acquisition of any public utility by pro
ceeding at once, without the submission
of propositions to the electors as afore
said, to pass an ordinance declaring its
determination to acquire the same aÂ»
provided in section six of this Article
and from proceeding thereafter to ac
quire the same in the manner herein
after provided. .
Sec. 4. In cuse the cost of any public
utility sought to be acquired under the
provisions of this Article, can be paid
out of the annual revenues of the city
and County, in addition to the other
necessary expenditures thereof, it shall
be lawful to acquire the same by a ma
jority vote of the electors voting there
on at any special election. In submit
ting propositions to the electors tor
such acquisition the Supervisors shall
specify in such proposition the cost .or
the public utility, the proposed metnoa
and manner of payment therefor, and
submit to the electors the question
whether the same shall be acquired
upon such terms.
In case, however, the cost or sucn
public utility suught to be acquired
under the provisions of this Article
Shall so far exceed the annual revenues
of the City and County, in addition to
the other necessary expenditures there
of, as to render it n.-.t^saiy w incur a
municipal bonded indebtedness for such
purpose, then the Supervisors, in sub
mitting propositions to the electors for
the acquisition thereof, shall specify
therein the amount of the proposed
bonded indebtedness, the rate of inter
est thereon, and whether such bonded
indebtedness shall be incurred. At
least two-thirds of the electors voting
thereon at such election shall be neces
sary to secure such acquisition and to
warrant the issuance of municipal
bonds therefor, as hereinafter set forth.
Sec. 5. When the electors by vote
shall have determined, as hereinbefore
set forth, to acquire any public utility,
such action on the part of the electors
shall be equivalent to the passing of
the ordinance by the Supervisors de
claring such determination as set forth
in section six of this Article, and the
Supervisors shall proceed without de
lay to pass an ordinance calling a
special election as required by section
seven of this Article.
Sec. 6. When the Supervisors shall de
termine that the public interest or ne
cessity demands the acquisition, con
struction or completion of any public
utility, the cost of which will be too
great to bepaid out of the ordinary an
nual income and revenue of the City and
County, the Supervisors shall, by or
dinance, specifically declare such de
termination, and shall publish the same
for at least two weeks in the official
nt-wspaper.
Sec. 7. At the next regular meeting rrt
the Supervisors after the publication of
the ordinance declaring said deter
mination as above set forth, or at an
adjourned meeting thereof, or not less
than two weeks nor more than four
weeks after the electors by vote shall
have determined To acquire any public
utility, the Supervisors by ordinance
shall call a special election, at which
shall be submitted to the electors the
proposition of acquiring such public
utility, and of incurring a debt for the
acquisition of the same as set forth in
such ordinance. No question other
than the acquisition of such utility and
the incurring of the Indebtedness
therefor shall be Submitted at such
election.
Sec. 8. The ordinance calling such
special election shall recite the objects
and purposes for which the indebted
ness is proposed to be incurred, the es
timated cost of the proposed public
utility, the necessity for the acquisition
of the same, and that bonds of the City
and County shall issue for the payment
of the cost of the same as in such or
dinance set forth (if the proposition be
accepted by the electors), and shall fix
a day on which such special election
shall be held, the manner of holding:
such election, and the manner of voting
for or against incurring such Indebted
ness. Such election shall be held an
provided by law for holding elections
in the City and County.
Sec. 9. Such ordinance shall be pub
lished daily for at least ten days in the
official newspaper. At the expiration
of said ten days the Supervisors shall
cause to be published daily for not less
than two weeks in the official newspa
per a notice of such special election.
Such notice shall specify the purpose
for which the indebtedness is to be In

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, April 4.â The interest and the
principal activity In the stock market to-day
â was in the first hour. The bulge at the open
ing was caused by the scramble to execute all
buying orders at once lor several thousand
shares In each of the leading stocks. These
orders were placed by frightened bears, who
saw a warning in the very buoyant tone as
sumed by American securities on foreign ex
changes and who had in mind the same ex
periences of the shorts of last Monday. Upon
the execution of this mass of orders at the
opening prices promptly sold off again. The
decline was arrested when rather more than
one-half of the advance had been wiped out.
Transactions for the remainder of the day
were small and fluctuations were narrow out
side of special cases and there was little of In
terest or importance in the stock market. Not
withstanding the later weakness net gains of
from 1 to over 2 points were saved for nearly
all the active stocks. 1 The opening Jump in
prices was in sympathy with the buoyancy
of Americans in foreign exchanges, where the
reported mediation of the Pope between the
United States and Spain was being viewed as
of the utmost importance. This improvement
was enhanced by the fact that the reports
given out I'mm Spanish sources had It that
the Pope's mediation was offered at the re
quest cf the United States. The sentiment of
peaceful adjustment found expression in
many pulpits In this country at Sunday's re
ligious services and tended to give color to
the peaceful outlook. Professional stock traders
who were after the bears' scalps were also
very busy disseminating an allegation that
President McKir.li-y had determined to em
body a recommendation against war or forcible
intervention in his forthcoming message. The
official denial from Washington that the
Pope had been accepted as a mediator between
the United States and Spain was potent in
dispelling this view. Expressions by men in
Washington who are strenuous for firm action
on the Cuban question and who expressed
th<-ir contentment with the assurances given
them after having seen the President indi
cate the purpose of the administration to in
sist upon ClUtfUl independence. .Notwithstand
ing these later revisions of -fnion the active
measures taken by the Pope were felt to offer
a Mosslble means of influence for Sr>a!n to
yield to the demands of the United States,
(â specially as the opinion of the Vatican here
tofore reported is inclined favorably toward
the granting of Cuban independence. This
constituted the sustaining force which pre
vented the market from a full reaction from
its opening gains.
The bond market was dull and after the
on nlng strong prices eased oft a little, but
stiffened again before the close. Total sales,
$1 725.000.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, April Wheat started at an ad
vance of Â»4@?4c for July at 84&@84%c. After
a few moments of hesitation, during which
time the price touched 84% c, the market as
sumed a decidedly bullish aspect, and under
active general buying pushed , up ' steadily to
85%0(E%c, that price being reached before, the
end of the first hour's trading. Buyers -and
sellers were quite evenly divided at first. The
Orange Judd Farmer reported the .crop con
dition and put the average at 89." This was
not so bearish as expected, but as the average
was the highest In seven years jj it j had its
effect. Liverpool was Md higher for spot
Wheat, though futures were irregular. The
strength shown by stocks was the real incen
tive of the early, buying by the crowd. Then
and there- factors developed. Heavy buying of
late, which has been credited by some to
Europe, was continued to-day and strengthened
the belief that a corner: in July similar to the
one in May was In process of formation. The
belief was general enough to scare shorts, who
made a concerted rush to cover when what
was supposed ' to be Armour buying was re
newed. : Offerings were much too limited ; for
this demand and the advance to 55%@85%c re
sulted. . Quite free ..realizing took place at
these figures, the price being, forced off to 85c.
Here the market turned again and the highest
prices of- the day were reached about noon,
July getting up to 85% c: Letter reported fur
ther cash sales of about 500,000 bushels.. Late
in the day another spell of realizing caused a
reaction 'in . July to 85>,ic, that price being
reached , near the close. July closed at 85J4@

The "gas meter" burglar, as he is
known to the police, still continues to ply
his vocation.
His latest victim is Herman Schussler.
Chief engineer of the Spring Valley Water
Works, who lives at 1905 \an Ness aye- j
nue. Several days ago the clever crook |
visited his house, and meeting one of the
servants announced to her that he was
appointed by the Board of Supervisors to
examine the gas meters of the city.
Being well dressed and suave in manner,
the accommodating servant pointed out
the meter. During her temporary ab
e.-nee he proceeded to search the rooms,
securing considerable money and Jewelry.
Sir. Schussler was aaleep at the time, and j
as the daring crook attempted to open the ;
door of his room he suddenly awakened.
In response to his questions as to what
the visitor wanted, the daring crook
suavely informed him that he was em- '
ployed by tho Supervisors to examine the
ga.s meter.
"Go ahead." answered Schussler. "I
guess you will find it is all right."
The burglar, after apologizing for awak
ening him, went to another room and pur
loined several articles of jewelry. After
satisfying himself that he had not over
looked anything of value the burglar left
tho house, profusely thanking the servant
for what he termed his courteous treat

DEATH'S FAIR YOUNG VICTIM,
MISS FRANCES FLORENCE ROSENSTIRN,
BERKELEY, April 4.â Miss Frances Florence Rosonstirn, a prominent mem
ber of the junior class at the State University, died on Saturday at the home of
her father, Dr. Julius Rosenstirn, 2G47 Bancroft way. Death was caused by
typhoid fever, which the young lady contracted about three weeks ago. For sev
eral days past she seemed to be recovering, but there came a relapse which
ended fatally.
The young lady was a native of San Francisco, and was IS years of age. Be
sides being well known among university people, she enjoyed a wide acquaint
ance In musical and social eireles In Berkeley. A sister. Miss Emily O. Rosen
stirn. who graduated from th" university at Christmas, and two younger broth
ers, Alfred and Brie, share the Brief of the parents.
Impure drinking water is believed to have brought about the fever which
cnus.-'i Ml 8Â« Rost nstirn's death. It was supposed by members of the family that
the drinking water at the university had caused the disease, but the college
authorities siate that the water a-t the university Is obtained from a separate
reservoir from that whence the town supply comes, and is much purer than the
t"\v?i BU] ply. They declare, moreover, that Miss Rosenstirn's sickness must have
ised by drinking watei from a private cistern from which the family
obtained p:nt >.f [v supply and which had not been cleaned for some time.
The news of Miss Rosenstlrn's death caused widespread regret at the uni
versity this morning. The university flap: was dropped to half-mast in the pres
ence of a group of classmates of the deceased student. President Kellogg im

Thi funeral will take place from the family residence tq-morroy morning at
B:4'. o'clock. The father. Dr. Rosenstirn, will be unable to witness the last sad

THE CODFISHJNG SCHOONER ARAGO.
Just before she started on her last unfortunate cruise the Arago was put on the California
Drydock and was given a thorough overhauling. The picture shows her being
breasted in toward the dock. The Arago was a favorite with the Lynde &
Hough Company and several times they refused good offers' for her. They con
sequently feel very badly over the report of her loss.

THESANTRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 5, 1898.
DISASTERS IN
ALASKAN SEAS
Three of the Crew of the
Codflshing Schooner
Arago Lost.
Got Drunk at a Wedding and
Tried to Return to Their
Ship In a Dory.
Now the Schooner Is Reported Lost
With the Remainder of
the Crow.
News of a tragrery and a probable dis
aster, in Alaskan waters, was made pub
lic yesterday. The tragedy was the
drowning, while leaving a wedding feast,
of three of the crew of the codfishlng
schooner Arago, and the other was the
probable loss, some weeks later, of the
vessel herself with all hands. The own
ers of the Arago have about given up all
hope. They say the only chance for the
srhooner's safety is that the captain de
layed the time of his departure in the
hope of making a catch of fish. When
last heard from the crew of the schooner
had not done well, and as they were all
on "a lay." the fishermen would not
want to come back empty handed.
The schooner Arago sailed from here
for I'nga Island on October 3 last with
the following crew:
"Gus" STtensland, captain; William
Smith, first mate; EL Marchussen, second
mate: A. Pahl, H. Hansen, Peter Paul
son, John Cord, G. R. Jones, O. Stevens,
Louis Ettel, Peter Jansen, A. Sorensen,
James Seymour, fishermen.
When last heard from the Arago and
the schooner Mary and Ida were in com
pany in Eagle Harbor, Nagai Island.
That was in the latter part of January,
and Captain Stensland pent word to the
owners of his vessel that he would leave
for home in a few weeks. The schooner
Winchester, which left after the Arago
is supposed to have sailed, arrived here
some time ago and sailed again March
24 on another eodiishlng cruise. There
fore both owners and outsiders think
there is very little hope for the Arago.
There- is a little romance mixed up with
the tragedy. Whin Captain "Bob" Carl
son left here on the Mary and Ida he was
supposed to find the schooner Winchester
and supply her with provisions. Instead
of looking for the Winchester, however,
he found a good looking half-breed
womiui at Eagle Harbor, and according
to the story which has reached here, fell
In love with and married her according
to Indian custom. In the meantime the
men on the Winchester were running
short of provisions and the captain de
cided to return to San Francisco. Sailors
and fishermen were all put on short al
lowance and when San Francisco was
reached there was only a small piece of
dried meat and fifty pounds of flour left
on the schooner to feed fourteen men.
It was after Carlson's wedding that the
disaster oe.curre<l. The Mary and Ida
was well provisioned and her skipper re
solved to give a big dinner in honor of
the event. The men on the Arago were
invited, but only Peter Paulson, G. R.
Jones and a third man whose name was
not ascertained, accepted. They had a
right royal time of it on the little cod
fisher, and as whisky was more plenti
ful than water it was not long before
everybody on board was more or less
under its influence.
When the party broke up two of the
Arago's men were Just able to get Into
their dory, but the third one was so
drunk he had to be lowered over the
side in a sline. That was the last seen
of Paulson, Jones and the unknown and
the dory. The chances are that the boat
capsized and the men were drowned, or
they may have drifted out to sea and
have frozen to death.
When the Winchester sailed a couple
of weeks ago Captain Kelton, late of the
barkentine Jane A. Falkinburg, went on
her as a passenger. He will relieve Cap
tain Carlson of the command of Uie Mary
and Ida and will bring that vessel back
to San Francisco.
Before returning, however, he, In com
pany with the Winchester, will make a
thorough search for the missing Arago.

"IRISH NIGHT"
IN PARLIAMENT
Local Government Bill
Does Not Cause Old-
Time Excitement.
The Call's Correspondent for
Ireland Describes the Battle
of Party Leaders.
Davltt Declares John Redmond the
Friend and Ally of the Irish
Landlords.
BY J. J. CLANCY.
LONDON, Marc' 28.â The chief busi
ness of the present session of the Brit
ish Parliament was reached at last on
Monday night, when the Irish local
government bill came on for second
reading Jn the House of Commons.
Contrary to what might have been ex
pected, neither in the House itself nor
In the lobbies outside was there any
sign of overweening interest in the
event >io crowd of visitors was wait
ing to get seats in the galleries, and the
members' own seats were nearly half
deserted. As I contrasted this apparent
want of interest in the matter of essen
tially vital importance with the scenes
witnessed in the same place in those
memorable days in 1886 and 1893 on
which Mr. Gladstone introduced his
Home Rule bills, I could not help say
ing to myself, "What a change!" Then
members came to the House to make
sure of their seats, at 6 o'clock in the
morning, breakfasted atid dined there,
and never left until Mr. Gladstone had
spoken, while of visitors there was a
crowd not one-quarter of which ever
had a chance of getting beyond the
outer lobby. The change, of course, is
to be accounted for largely by the fact
that the reform now proposed in the
government of Ireland is a smaller one,
though in its scope not less far-reach
ing than the measure of Mr. Gladstone.
But there was another reason, also, for
the apparent indifference which
marked the appearance of the House
of Commons on Monday night. It is
that every one knew that there was to
be no fight.
Mr. Gerald Balfour, the Minister in
charge of the bill, knew this fact per
fectly well, and showed that he did by
making no introductory speech. He
moved the second reading by lifting his
hat, which he wore on this occasion for
the special purpose of discharging that
function in that precise way. The de
bate which succeeded, nevertheless,
though comparatively lifeless, brought
out several of the leaders. of parties
and developed some interesting views.
Mr. Dillon and Mr. Davltt spoke for
the larger section of the anti-Parnell
ltea; Mr. T. M. Healy for the smaller;
Mr. John Redmond for the Parnellite
party; Colonel Saunderson and Mr.
Rentoul for the Irish Unionists; Mr.
John Morley for the British Liberals
and Mr. Balfour wound up the debate
on behalf of the Government. I need
not trouble my readers with any ex
planation of the line taken by each of
these speakers beyond saying that Mr.
Dillon and Mr. Davltt were hostile to
a great many parts of the bill, though
they would not vote against it; that
Mr. Redmond and Mr. Healy were
generally favorable to it; that Colonel
Saunderson accepted it unwillingly and
Mr. Rentoul gladly; that Mr. Morley
was evidently suffering from chagrin
at the success of the Unionist Govern
ment in formulating a measure of Irish
reform, and that Mr. Balfour pretty
plainly Indicated that he would not
yield to the demands of the Irish mi
nority for the mutilation and des\.-uc
tion of the bill. But one or two pas
sages of the debate were interesting
from one point of view or another, and
will bear a brief notice here.
The first bit of liveliness was intro
duced Into the debate by Mr. Redpiond.
whose speech, apparently worked up
Mr. Davitt into something like a fit of
temper. The member for Waterford,
who Is one of the best speakers in the
House of Commons and is always well
listened to, ventured ami 1 perfect
stillness to allude to Mr. Dillon's habit
of *ppeakine ajrnfltist a bill and then
voting for It." He went on apropos of
the proposed pecuniary relief to the
Irish lnnd.lorf"'" ,-,p the nrlofl of thei* ' â¢
ceplance of the bill, to declare that.
The fac-siaiile /H& S/&7^~ /* *"* *â¢ on ever TFrapper
idfiaatnrelof -v.^ii^&J^vS^^^ of CASTOUIA.
r
though the Irish landlord system had
been Infamously bad*, the Irish people
did not desire to keep up a war againat
the present Irish landlords, and wouiu,
therefore, moke no objection to that
relief being given. Mr. Davitt could not
6taud all this, and toward the close of
the debate "let himself go." He de
scribed Mr. Redmond as the friend and
ally of the Irish landlords, and said that
he ought to sit among them, while he
declared that he himself would fight to
the bitter end against any pecuniary
advantage being given to that class In
connection with a measure of ' Irish
county government reform. It was
long since any such attack had been
made upon one Irish Nationalist mem
ber by another, but Mr. Redmond mere
ly smiled at It, and his friends had no
need to defend him, for, when Mr.
Davitt sat down up jumped Tim Healy
to make answer In his own caustic
style and amid generai laughter.
What would have followed if the de
bate had lasted much longer it is diffi
cult to say, for Mr. Redmond had one
or two of his friends at hand who much
desired to say something. As it was.
the hour for closing the debate for the
night had come, and there was an end
of the incident.
Another passage of the debate which
attracted much notice was the differ
ence of view developed between the
two exponents of Irish Unionist opin
ion. Colonel Saunderson represents the
landlord section of the Irish Unionists,
being himself a prominent Irish land
lord; Mr. Rentoul, on the other hand,
who is an Irishman practicing at the
English bar, may be said to represent
the Presbyterians of Ulster who, gener
ally speaking, are not landlords, but
tenants. Hitherto, those two sections
have been united in opposition to home
rule and their champions in Parliament
have used much the same arguments
on that subject. But on Monday night
a rather startling difference of opinion
showed itself between them on a vital
point. One of the main arguments
used by both in the past against giving
national self-government to Ireland
was that it would be used outside Ul
ster to persecute and oppress the "loyal
minority." While Colonel Saunderson
apparently holds this view still, Mr.
Rentoul took the occasion presented by
tills debate to renounce it. He con
tended that the minority were in no
danger whatever, and that all the talk
about the Catholic majority being their
"natural enemies" was all bosh. I saw
some Unionists seated round about the
London-Irish lawyer frankly stare at
this announcement coming from such a
source, and certainly Colonel Saunder
son, Mr. Carson and some other Irish ;
Unionists laughed outright. But every
one felt all the same that the heavy- j
going member for Dover had said a !
thing that was important and that
would not be forgotten In the future.
Nor will it be, for it is an acknowledg
ment coming from an authoritative
quarter which simply knocks the bot
tom out of the case against home rule.
After Mr. T. M. Healy had said his
say the debate on the second reading
of the Irish local government bill came
to a close. It was, on the whole, the
dullest Irish debate on an important
subject I have heard during the last
twelve or thirteen years; but the rea- ;
son for that circumstance I have al- i
ready explained. The inevitable had
come, and every one felt that there was
no use in resisting the decree of fate,
and, therefore, everything was quiet.
It was, in fact, more like a Scotch
fight in the House of Commons than an
Irish one. On a Scotch night twenty
nr thirty Scotch members have every
thing their own way. Those gentlemen
on such an occasion have the chamber
fill to themselves, and to an outsider
t is little wonder that they should be
allowed such a monopoly. They talk
on subjects that nobody else under
stands, and talk of them, into the bar
gain, in a tone so unexciting and in ac
cents so strange and unintelligible that
only their own countrymen could en
dure the infliction. No Irishmen, of j
course, could fall to so uninteresting a
level as the Scotch standard of business
excellence; but Monday night's per-
I formance â the first of its kind in my
experience â reminded one at least of
what the Scotch are capable and are,
indeed, in the habit of doing in the
British talking shop. The only consola
tion is that, while the Scotch are pretty
certain to continue to be what they
have been, the Irish are equally cer
tain to give the British portion of the
Parliament lively times before the
session is over.
NEVADA BARS
CATTLE HERDS
Governor Budd Appeals
in Vain to Governor
Sadler.
California Stock Will Not Be
Permitted to Cross
the Line.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CARSON, April 4.â The following: let
ter was received by Governor Sadler to
day:
To Governor Sadler: Sirâ Governor
Budd has been informed that you have
protested to the Secretary of Agriculture
against granting 1 an order permitting the
shipment of California cattle into the |
State of Nevada, to lie fed or pastured.
claiming they were affected with splenetic
fever and would contaminate the cattle ;
in your State. Governor Budd Is con
vinced that the cattle whose owners are
now seeking to have them admitted into
the northern part of this State and into
Nevada and adjoining Territories are in
no wise afflicted with disease nor in any
wise liable to contaminate or infect other
herds with which they mingle. The pres
ent quarantine in California was ordered !
upon information that the disease existed .
in some parts of the State. Pending in
vestigation as to the exact localities, the j
line was placed very far north of the i
suspected districts to be sure to include i
all sections.
In view of the freedom of cattle now
seeking admission to your State from
disease whatever and considering the ex
traordinary conditions which now con
front stock breeders, by which destruc
tion of property is threatened through
starvation. Governor Hudd would be
pleased to have you withdraw the protest
if possible and consent to an order by the
Secretary of Agriculture permitting the
shipment of starving cattle into sections
of your State where they can be fed or
pastured. Very respectfully,
PETER J. SHIELDS,
Private Secretary.
The Governor replied he could not re
cede from his position and referred to
the following:
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 4. 1593.
Governor Sadler: This department will
issue no permits allowing infected cattle
to enter your State. Inspectors report the
districts free from infection south of the
recent California quarantine line. Per
mits may be granted from such unin
focted districts by inspectors, but only
after inspection and other inspections to
guard against infection. Assure your
cattlemen that they will be fully "pro
tected. JAMES WILSON,
Secretary of Agriculture.
Letters are pouring in from all parts
of the State asking the Governor to
stand by his original position. The ex-
I citement is intense in the smaller coun
| ties of the State. The Governor told a
j correspondent this evening that, no Cal
; ifornia cattle should cross the Navada
; line.
