of the southern claimant for first hon

. â â  The election of Jacob H. Neff this
â  ' afternoon as temporary chairman of
the Republican convention is most sig
'â  nificant politically, as it demonstrates
. that Henry T. Gage has a support
greater than the combined following of
lite 'rivals. The contest between J. C.
â  .Campbell and Jacob H. Neff had far
â¢.riV.ire meaning than a simple struggle
fir 'the honor of presiding over the
great body of delegates. Every vote
cast shadowed a ballot for a gxxberna
tririal aspirant.
\s shown In The Call this morning,
â  the' -opponents of Gage saw yesterday
that their only possible hope of victory
â¢ rested in a combined effort to thrust
" the Los Angeles man out of the fight
â¢ by binding the convention to select its
gubernatorial nominee from the central
. or northern part of the State. Such a
decision could not be won from the con
vention except by a union of forces.

a plan of action that suggested at least
the possibility of success. Fitzgerald,
Dickinson, Pattern and other aspirants
of minor importance naturally became
enthusiastic parties to the scheme.
At that time the only feasible plan of
action was to attempt the adoption of
a resolution restricting the choice of
the convention to the northern and cen
tral counties. The- opponents of Gage
had no means then of knowing that the
managers of the southern man had de
cided to force the issue, to pledge
themselves to a candidate for tempo
rary chairman and to hazard their own
fortunes by selecting a nominee for
Lieutenant Governor in the person of
Jacob H. Neff. This policy of the Gago
forces in a very material measure gave
the other gubernatorial candidates the
very weapon for which they had been
seeking.
Another conference was held this
morning and the plan of action was
changed to suit the new conditions.
Instead of framing the resolution as
Indicated It was decided to oppose Neff
for chairman. If the opposition proved
successful It would show that the
manipulation of certain forces might
defeat Gag*. In fighting Neff the
country delegates, who are not fol
lowers of either Brown or Pardee,
might be coaxed into li.ne with the cry
that a combination between Los An
geles and San Francisco had been per
fected. The Pardee forces marched
through the streets shouting In unison
that they would break the "slate," no

matter what the consequences. A
candidate to oppose Neff as temporary
chairman was sought and found in J.
C. Campbell of San Francisco.
Votes were rounded up and every
thing was placed in readiness for the
battle of the afternoon. If Neff won
it was admitted on all sides that the
victory foreshadowed the triumph of
Henry T. Gage on the first ballot. No
political trick was to be overlooked,
therefore, and when the convention as
sembled there was the anticipation of
events fax more Important than the
election of temporary officers.
As even this transpired Jacob H.
Neff won an overwhelming victory.
The convention rang with cheers as
the triumph presaged the coming of
Henry T. Gage. All the delegates of
Alameda, with a few scattering in
other counties, and representing the
Pardee contingent, voted solidly for J.
C. Campbell. Most of the smaller
northern counties, grouped as followers
of L. H. Brown, fell into the same
column to defeat. San Francisco, Los
Angeles and practically all of the
southern counties ranged up behind
Neff and carried him into the chair.
The convention saw that Gage will be
the nominee for Governor and Neff for
Lieutenant-Governor.

BROWN AND
Pardee, Sullen Yet Hopeful,
Alone Opposes the Man
From the South.
CALL. HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Aug. 23.â This is the way a
well known San Francisco attorney
who came here for the purpose of plac
ing one of the many gubernatorial as
pirants in nomination sums up the
events of the day:
"There is nothing to It but Gage.
Brown, Pardee, and the other small fry
are dead cocks in the pit."
It may be a blunt way of expressing
it, but for all that it is none the less
true. To-night the Gage boomers are
jubilant, and their joy but adds to the
solemnity with which the followers of
the less fortunate candidates view the
mistakes and misfortunes of the past
few hours. They admit defeat, but they
still clingr to the hope that some sort
of political earthquake may yet so dis
arrange the pieces in the game that a
new deal will be called for and all
hands will have an opportunity to start
in afresh, having experience gained of
past mistakes as a guide to certain
success.
But there will be no earthquake of
the kind hoped for. To-night Gage is
being treated to a landslide of votes,
and there is no longer any doubt that
he will be nominated on the first bal
lot. Brown was the first to realize this
and to-night his withdrawal from the
race is announced. Pardee is sullen.
the end, and
but determined to stay to
the others are nowhere.
To-day was the first day of the Re
publican State con/ention, a conven
tion that was expected to be one of the
notable ones in the history of the party
in this State. This expectation will
probably not be realized, as the condi
tions that have tipped the balance In
favor of the favorite son of the south
land will also wield an influence in the
contest for minor places on the ticket.
Even so, there are enough candidates
and to spare, and the remaining days
of the session will not be without in
terest.
As was foretold in these dispatches
yesterday, Jacob H. Neff, the old Re
publican warhorse of Placer County,
was chosen as the temporary presiding
officer of the convention. To-day he
will be made permanent chairman, and
If present calculations don't miscarry,
he will also receive the nomination for
Lieutenant Governor.
His selection for the chairmanship
was taken by the opponents of Gage
as an opportunity of showing their
strength. That the result was disas
trous was due to the fact that the inex
perience of the Brown and Pardee polit
ical managers led them into the error
of believing that their candidates were

egates assembled here. They ascer
tained their mistake when it was too
late, and after they had put forward
a candidate to beat Neff for the chair
manship.
The deplorable weakness as shown by
the size of the vote cast by Neff's oppo
nent also exposed the weakness of the
man who had put him forward, and
was the first indication of what might
be expected to follow.
When the convention closed its ses
sion for the day the landslide began,
and in The Call of Thursday morning
will probably be printed Henry T.
Gage's address accepting the nomina
tion for Governor at the hands of the
Republican State Convention.
While the contest between the aspir
ants for the gubernatorial nomination
has been the most absorbing topic of
the day, other things have happened,
some of them having a direct bearing
on the scramble for the place at the
head of the ticket, that are of particular
interest to the people of the State.
There is yet grave doubt as to who will
be selected as nominee for the two
places on the ticket aesigned to Asso
ciate Justices for the Supreme Court,
and this doubt is wholly due to the rail
road influence that has so often before

CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Aug. 23.â The day for the as
sembling of the convention was ausplcous.
The day was warm and it might be in
ferred that Major McLaughlin was as
warm as tl^e day as he stepped on the
platform dressed in his summer suit. The
delegates assembled in the convention
hall saluted the major and paid th*ir
compliments to Secretaries MV R. Hig
gins and Jacob Steppacher as they pre
pared to open the session.
The first music of the band cheered the
delegates at 1:15 p. m. At that time
nearly all the delegates were in the
places assigned to them. The little flags
waved. One thousand American flags
had been distributed, one to each dele
gate, according to directions of Paris Kll
burn.
At 1:45 Major McLaughlin announced:
â¢The convention will please come to order.
It will be opened by singing of the quar
tet."
The quartet of ladies, with accompani
ment, sang "America," the delegates ris
ing in compliment to the hymn and tha
ladies.
Major Land of Sacramento was Intro
duced to the convention by the major and
â welcomed the delegates to the Capitol
City.
The "Star Spangled Banner" was then
sung by the quartet, the audience rising
and Joining in the chorus. The scene waa
Impressive and the music inspiring. The
song was followed by cheers for the flag,
cheers for President McKlnley, cheers
for Admiral Dewey, and cheers for the
ladies of Sacramento.
"The convention will come to order,"
commanded the chairman. Desk officers
were named. Major McLaughlin an
nounced that the selection of a temporary
chairman was in order. Frank Powers of
San Francisco placed in nomination for
temporary chairman Jacob H. Neff of
Placer. Judge Van R. Paterson of San
Francisco named as a candidate for tem
porary presiding officer the "Prince of
Parliamentarians," Joseph C. Campbell of
San Francisco.
The Alameda delegation and quite a
number of delegates from Northern Cali
fornia cheered the Campbell candidacy.
For two hours before the convention as
sembled the supporters of Brown and
Pardee had boasted that they would elect
Campbell chairman. Prior to the selec
tion of Campbell as their candidate they,
had withdrawn A. L. Levlnsky of San
Joaquln, who had been frequently men
tioned and at one time slated as their
choice. Pardee's adherents and Brown's
men had three or four conferences early
in the day. They entertained the hope
that Campbell would derive considerable
support from the San Francisco delega
tion and that Santa Clara and San Diego
delegates would rally to his standard.
This delusion was dispelled when San
Diego cast a solid vote for Jacob Neff
and when hardly a defection from Neff
was recorded in the vote of the San
Francisco Assembly District delegation.
The Brown and Pardee adherents cheer
ed when Alameda, Del Norte, Humboldt
and other counties cast their strength for
Campbell, but the demonstrations of Joy
were not prolonged or vociferous. A. L.
Levinsky of San Joaquin seconded the
nomination of J. C. Campbell. Frank
North of Alameda also seconded the nom
ination of Mr. Campbell. J. S. McÃride of
Nevada seconded the nomination of Jacob
Neff. The roll v,as called by counties and
Assembly districts. When the roll call
had been proceeded with as far down the
district as Santa Clara County the vote
stood 192 for Camnbell and 468 for Neff
Van R. Paterson
then moved that the
nomination of Mr.
Neff be made unani
mous. The motion
prevailed. Mr. Neff
was escorted to the
chair and made a
brief speech, thank-
Ing the convention
for the honor con
ferred upon him.
The convention gave
the chairman a cor
dial reception.
Grove L. Johnson
of Sacramento moved
the appointment of a
committee of fifteen.
on permanent organ
isation and order of business. Â£.
F. Preston of San Mateo moved that
the committee be composed of
twenty-one. Mr. Johnson accepted the
amendment. T. C. Hocking of Stanislaus
moved the appointment of a committee
of twenty-one on credentials. Carried.
Reuben H. Lloyd of San Francisco mov
ed the appointment of a committee of
twenty-one on platform and the motion
was carried.
A motion was made by Mr. Paterson to
take a recess until 7 o clock.
Ex-Senator William Johnson of Sacra
mento suggested that time should be
given to the chairman In which to select
the committees. Chairman Neff replied
that the motion to take a recess had in
view the purpose of giving the chair am
ple time to select the committees. The
statement hud been made, observed the
chair, that the prepared list of commit

tees was in his pocket. It was not true.
He proposed to take ample time to con
sider the names referred to him. The mo
tion to take a recess prevailed without
opposition.
The election of Mr. Neff to the tempo
rary cnairmanship was readily accepted
as the first triumph for Henry T. Gage,
Delegates who had some doubts earlier
in the day admitted after the display of
strength in the vote for Neff that Pafdee
and Brown were practically out of the
race.
The delegates were slow in getting to
gether at the Agricultural Pavilion for
the evening session. When the hour of
7 o'clock arrivedâ the expiration of the
recess â very few places on the floor were

occupied by delegates.
The recess hours were given up to a
discussion by many of the delegates of
the probable time of adjournment sine die.
The nomination of Henry T. Gagu is accept
ed as an assured fact by the most zealous
friends of Pardee and Brown, and it is
believed that the delegates have generally
made up their minds as to nominees for
subordinate places. Along the line of pro
posed nominations there may be sharp
and exciting contests for Secretary of
State and Superintendent of Public In
struction.
Early in the day it was thought there
would be no opposition to Jacob H. Neff
for Lieutenant Governor, but this evening
a change of convention Sentiment J.s
noted. It is feared that Mr. Neff's
strength is not equal to the task of per
forming the duties, of the office. A
younger and more active candidate is de
manded.
At 7:30 o'clock all the delegates were in
their allotted places, arid some began to
manifest a desire for the session to begin.
Presently Chairman Neff rapped the con
vention to order and directed the secre
tary to read the list of committees ap
pointed. The commltt.ee on credentials

A. O. Larkin of Tulare was opposed to

the time has come when economy should
be practiced in the affairs of this State
government.
It is not necessary for me to say to

CURRY IS ASSURED
OF THE NOMINATION
Has Been Pledged the Unanimous Vote
of the Metropolitan Delegation
for Secretary of State.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. Aug. 23.â The San Francisco
delegation has asserted itself. For the
first time in the history of many politi
cal conventions a Republican delegation
from the metropolis unites upon a single
candidate and as a unit demands a con
cession for any favor it may grant.
At a caucus of the San Francisco dele
gation held to-night the chairman was
instructed by a unanimous vote to cast
the 156 votes of the delegation for Charles
F. Curry for Secretary of State. Having
taken this action, the leaders of the dele
gation announced that if a;iy combina
tions are to be made with San Francisco
exchanges will be made for Curr; alone.
This action Is deeply significant and
practically as3ures the nomination of
Curry. What effect it may have on the
candidacy of other aspirants from San
Francisco remains to be seen. There ax*
BeVeraJ politicians from the metropolis
eagerly looking for the prize offered by
the clerkship of the Supreme Court.
They are naturally disturbed at the unani
mous support pledged to Curry.
This pledfeV' to the County Clerk of San
Francisco is the first great political
"trade" effected since the victory of NefT
made the nomination of Henry T. Gage
a certainty. The support of abler guber
natorial candidates became available as
"trading" forces for minor offices on the
State, ticket, and Curry is the first to
seize the most powerful delegation in the
convention.
Before the convention met this after
noon the San Francisco delegation assem
bled to organize and elect permanent of
ficers. Percy Beamiah was chosen chair
man and Henry Sonntag secretary. An
adjournment was then taken until this
evening at 8 o'clock. At that hour only
a few delegates appeared and another
recess was taken until 10:30 o'clock. When
the delegation again met nearly all of the
delegates were in attendance. It was then
decided, as indicated, to instruct the
chairman to cast the entire vote of the
metropolitan delegation for Curry for the
position of Secretary of State. The rep
resentatives of San Francisco occupy now
therefore, a position that has very seldom
been given to them. They constitute a
trading delegation that no leader, however
powerful he may be. will dare oppose.

tion.
He will be placed in nomination by T. B.

FIRST VOTE NOT A
TEST OF STRENGTH
Pardee Attaches No Significance
to the Election of Neff
as Chairman.
SACRAMENTO, Aug. 23.â There
is no particular lesson to be learned
nor inference to be drawn from the
events of this afternoon on the floor
of the convention. The vote as be
tween Jacob H. Neff and J. C. Camp
bell was not a true test of strength
between those who are seeking the
first place on the ticket. Mr. Neff is a
very popular man and is as good as
he is popular. He is known and trust
ed from one end of the State to the
other.
It is perfectly natural that a ma
jority of the delegates to the conven
tion should wish to pay him the com
pliment of electing him chairman of
the convention. Because of this the
vote cannot be considered a test vote
and cannot be taken as an indication
of the result of the contest for the
gubernatorial nomination.

It was moved by Dr. Ragan that no

I unanimously carried. Then the commit

When this part of the pill was swal
lowed the entire committee came together
and tendered a vote of thanks to Major

j Sacramento and for the good work which
j he undertook in their behalf.
But one thing the committee did not do
and that was to adjourn sine die. This
proposition received some discussion and
the great majority of the members stood
! firm in regard to the proposition that the
party they represented was the genuine
party and not a faction and that they
should continue to exist. After a vote it
was determined that an adjournment
should be taken subject to the call from
the chairman for future meetings. The
entire general committee will be can
vassed, and the prevailing opinion as to
I whether the party should organize for the

I in regard to the preparation for the battle

Crushed in a Cannery.
Miss Mamie Hynes of 313 Filbert street
met with an accident yesterday afternoon
in a fruit cannery at the corner of San
some street and Broadway. Her foot
was accidentally caught in the machin
ery, and before assistance could be ren
dered it was badly crushed. She was
taken to the Receiving Hospital. The at
tending physician thought the injury
might develop into such a character as to
permanently disable her from resuming
her duties in the factory.
Miss Hynes and her mother, who is
also an employe in the same cannery, re
ceive small wages for rhÂ°ir labor, and
their work was the sole means of support
for themselves and seven children.

SACRAMENTO, Aug. 23.
My country, 'tiÃ of thee.
Strains of melody such as touch the
heart swelled up through a waving forest
of flags; then from a thousand throats
came the words of a well-loved sons-
The Star Spangled Banner.
At. the first note the vast audience, act
ing on a common and instant impulse, was
lifted to its feet; the banners kept time
to the music. There seemed to be a radi
ant garden of bloom. The men and
women who sang were earnest. They for
got that they were at a political conven
tion. For the moment they were noth
ing but Americans and patriots, the colors
of their country all around them, the em
blem of liberty, which valor has newly
planted on alien shores, the one thought.
High above the red, white and blue
formed a canopy. Around the walls were
ranged pictures of heroes.
The singing was led by a double quar
tet of sweet and powerful tone, to the
accompaniment of horns and drums.
The scenes and the sounds were Inspir
ing. Men who an hour before had been
shouting as they marched the streets be
decked with the gaudy badge of their
chosen leader, stood grasping the staff of
n Sag and joining in the refrain. There
were tears in the eyes of some of them.
There was a tremor in mnny of the voices.
It was as though a prayer were being
sung.
There was n. span of silence, and next
three cheers for the "Star Spangled Ban
ner" was floating afar, rolling through
the open windows to subdue the turmoil
of the street, dying away among the raft
er? of the immense pavilion, leaving an
echo and a memory.
X.) such cheers had been heard there a
week before. No hail to the Stars and
Stripe?, no show of patriotic fervor; noth
ing but a sordid clamor for office, the
hurling of an epithet, a ripple of laughter
at <=ome joke.
To one who had been present on both
occasions the contrast was almost humil
iating, for the throng of the week before
had been American citizens, under the
protection of this same flag. They sim
ply had forgotten. They had business or.
hand which they deemed of greater im
portance. They had personal grievances
and selfish ambitions which had to be con
sidered first. If similar things crop up bo
fore the adjournment of the second con
vention they will have to await a proper
period.
Tn-day's cheers were not all of the char
acter marking the opening, save that
they were hearty. There were more for
the President of the United States, ami
for the Indies. Tho fair visitors smiled
and blnshod. The crowd was in a mood
for cheering. In an orderly and proper
wnv it m-ide manifest a desire to shout.
There was not much loss of time. In
deed, these prelftnlnaries did not rcpro
sent a loss of tirr.e. but after they were
over the gathering was at once down to
business. The speeches were short and
crisp, when a choice was to be made of
temporary chairman.
Personally I was sorry to see Mr. Neff
take the chair, because he did not seem
physically fit for the ordeal. It is not
probable he will liavp to throw diplomatic
barriers be.tween hostile factions, as Budd
did last week. There is no reason for
supposing he will be obliged to devote
his energies -to keeping two w.ann gen
tlemen from publicly blacking each oth
er's eyes. Such tasks, I doubt not. would
be trying to one of Neff's age and appar
ent infirmity. But tho chairman made a
manly and forceful address, in which he
denounced as false the charge that he
was there as the representative ol any
clique or boss. He did this with a vigor
which made the operation virtually that
which the fighting Democracy acquired
the habit laEt week of terming "ram
ming the lie down the throat of the op
position." Yet Mr. Neff did not deem it
necessary to so describe it.
There was a recess so that committees
could be named, and during the recess
I write this. It is not my province to go
Into an analysis of the situation. The sit
uation is set forth in detail, and the
State Is /ull of as good guessers as my
self. I was struck with the enthusiasm,
the genial candor and the celerity of
procedure. The speakers were in good
voice and could be heard. Even Grove
L. Johnson of Sacramento and San Fran
cisco, and boundless hopes of being else
where, piped so as to be audible three
rows of seats from where his whiskers
wagged. Several men so elderly that
years had crowned them with snow
white hair stood well back in the house,
and yet when they spoke not a syllable
but was distinct.
I had judged from the Examiner post
er, It being of a size to make horses
shy, that after Tom Williams had viewed
the landscape o'er, there would he noth
ing to say of what had passed, while the
prophetic eye of General Barnes would
lay bare the future so minutely that to
know It in advance would require only
the trouble of reading: after him. I con
fess to some disappointment. I think
lhat Williams' greatest success has been
In providing for persons who incautious
ly insert want ads in Hearsts paper those
cunning little chromos at one sight of
which they never want anything more
enough to advertise for It. Readers are
becoming as timid as the people who
used to Insert want ads. They must get
a Williams chromo with every copy of
the Examiner, and if they don't want to
buy a copy it is thrust upon them. But
ADVERTISEMENTS.
Do you know the
most luxurious bath
in the world?
Have you used
Pears' Soap?
General Barnes covered himself with
laurel and with bay. It Is said of him
that he has proved himself a better jour
nalist than he is a lawyer. In thinking
this over I conclude somebody has been
joshing him. He certainly has the gift of
pretty words, but when he takes his pen
in hand he piles the words so high above
any idea that one wonders what the
pile ia for.
To-night the streets are less noisy,
lucre is an absence of shouts, and the
brass-banding for the present mostly
stands adjourned. This evening's session
was briof and only for the naming of the
committees. These committees are now
at work, and some of them will be at It
so long that the probability of the con
vention's being called to order on time to
morrow is remote.
Of course there are caucuses galore.
Many delegates who have no other en
gagement are out at the old pavilion,
where a ceremony known as a jinks is in
progress. The precise nature of this af
fair had not been announced, but there
being a general belief that the character
of it was to lack solemnity and its pur
pose to drive dull care away, it drew.
There were speeches and music, good
stories, well told, and a number of jokes.
One of these was cruel. No delegate
likes to have his expectations raised at
sight of a beer barrel surrounded by Ice.
and then have a polite attendant extract
water from the barrel. However, the Joke
went down all right.
There have been several remarks to
day about the weather. I refrain from
quoting. There has been a noticeable
warmth of temperature, which the Sac
ramentans shrewdly discount by hang
ing thermometers on the refrigerator and
fanning them. The heat vanished with
the sun and a measure of joy came into
life again. The convention hall was
kept comfortable, although the 300-horse
power fan had to hump itself throughout
the session.
The only band playing in this vicinity
now is stationed in front of the Golden
Eagle Hotel, while upon the front wall of
that resort of statesmen is suspended the
banner brought by the Gage people. The
banner is flanked by seven others, all
representing counties south of Tehachapl
and all for Gage. Still endeavoring to
avoid prophecy, I venture the prediction
that the gentleman from the orange belt
Is in the race.
It will be observed that of the conven
tion itself I have said little, the reason
being that there Is little to say in an ac
count devoid of details. The session was
picturesque for an opening, notably patri
otic in the opening; but when it had set
tled down to business was unmarked by
incident. One or two members showed
symptoms of bursting into speech, but
the chairman saw no excuse for permit
ting them to burst; so if the event occur
it will be due to pressure within. There
will doubtless be a loosening of the
dammed flood of eloquence to-morrow.

Delegates.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Aug. 23.â The citizens of Snrra
mento, appreciating the presence of the
Republican delegates to the convention
in session here, again showed their hos
pitality to-night by extending an invita

ALEXANDER FROSTBITTEN.
He Wanted to Be a Railroad Commis
sioner, but Won't.
CA"LLr HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Aug. 23.â C. O. Alexander of
Oakland is making some exceedingly
caustic remarks on the peculiar climatic
conditions of Sacramento, and its per
nicious effects on the members of his
home delegation. Alexander rushed up
stairs in the Golden Eagle this evening
from the torrid sidewalk with his brow
covered with that medium which is popu
larly supposed to be exchanged for tho
staff of life at par and a burning am
bition in his breast. Projecting himself
upon the Alameda delegation he an
nounced himself a candidate for Railroad
Commissioner in the Third District, and
asked his fellow citizens to abet his am
bition to the extent of supporting him in
the district convention.
Then something happened. Alexander
swears it was a blizzard, but the others
say it was only a frost. Anyway, instead
of perspiration Alexander's face suddenly
became decorated with homeopathic
Icicles and the ambition of his soul co
agulated then and there. Somebody
whistled a bar of "Get Along. Nigger,
Do." another burst into the chorus of
"Go to Sleep, My Baby." while the ma
jority contented themselves with plain
talk, the substance of which was, "You'd
better remain In private life a while
longer old man."
â When Alexander gets back to Oakland
and makes his announcement that he is
out of politics, the Athenians can buy
pools that he is giving them a straight
tip.
SAN JOAQUIN MEN CAUCUS.
Select a Number of Candidates for
Preferment, to Whom They
Pledge Support.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Aug. 23. â A second caucus was
held this evening by the San Joaquin dele
gation in the parlors of the eMtropolitan
House for the purpose of agreeing on
candidates for the various nominations.
C. M. Kenniston. chairman of the dele
gation, presided, and Irving Martin acted
as secretary. Ballots were taken at fre
quent intervals to test the feeling of the
delegation toward the candidates under
discussion. It was definitely decided that
Frank Ryan would receive the solid sup
port of the delegation for Congress from
the Second Congressional pistrict. Wil
liam Clark will have the united vote of
the delegation for Railroad Commissioner
and Judges MeFarland and Van Fleet,
who are at present on the Supreme Bench,
will receive the solid vote of the delega
tion.
The delegation favors the candidacy of
Alexander Brown, who is seeking the
nomination for Equalizer from the Second
District.
Candidates Kirk and Black, who are
struggling for the nomination for Superin
tendent ff Public Instruction, have divid
ed the delegation, but there Is a decided
leaning toward Kirk for the position.
While the delegation f.Â« net pledged to
Tlrey L. For.l. it is holding back with a
view to gaining support for its candidate.
Another caucus will be held to-morrow,
when further decisions will be reached.
NEFF FOR THE â¢
SECOND PLACE
OBLIGED BY HIS FRIENDS TO
ENTER THE RACE
He Will Not Withdraw From the Con
test, but Will Battle to the'
End.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Aug. 23.â A half dozen aspirants,
each entertaining tne idea that anybody
would do for the office of Lieutenant
Governor, came to Sacramento seeking
the nomination for that position, but a
large majority of the delegates to the
convention entertained quite a different
notion concerning the office and oegan to
look over the field for a widely known
and representative Republican whose
name would give character and strength
to the State ticket.
After discussing the wants of several
eminent men it was decided to ask Jacob
H. Neff to accept the nomination for
Lieutenant Governor. At first he de
clined, but subsequently, at the earnest
request of many delegates and other lead
ing Republicans, reluctantly consented to
his name going before the convention.
When this acceptance became known
self-constituted candidates became unus
ually and suddenly concerned about the
health of Mr. Neff". To-night they began
in whispers to deplore the old minor's
condition. Soon the whispers grew Into
open talk and current rumor that Mr.
Neffs name would be withdrawn. It is
learned from a source absolutely authen
tic that Jacob Neff has no thought of
withdrawing from the contest. He en
tered the field reluctantly at the earnest
Importunities of many prominent Re
publicans, and now being in the fight he
will stay there until the bajlots are count
ed and the result Is announced.
The sentiment among delegates, freely
expressed to-night, is that Jacob Neff's
name will add to the strength of the
ticket, and afford many old-time Repub
lican voters especial gratification.
PLACER DELEGATES
WILL UPHOLD NEFF
All Their Energies Will Be Devoted to
Securing for Him the Lieuten
ant-Governorship.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Aug. 23.â The Placer County
delegation intend to make a strong fight
for J. H. Neff for the nomination of 'Lieu
tenant-Governor. This was deckled this
morning at the caucus of the delegation
in the parlor of the Metropolitan House.
After F. P. Tuttle had been elected
chairman and O. L. Barton secretary,
the members took up the discussion of
the temporary chairmanship. At the
outset !t was unanimouely decided that
Neff receive the entire vote of the dele
gation. The best means of gaining him
a place on the ticket then occupied the
attention of the members.
It is the purpose of the delegates from
Placer to place their candidate In tho
Held and show no preference fur any of
the gubernatorial candidates now striv
ing for a nomination, so that by evenly
dividing their vote among the three fore
most candidates Neff' s chances will not
be jeopardized. Acting upon this plan,
a vote was taken, with the result that
Brown received 3 votes; Oage 4. and Par
dee ?,. Judge McFarland. has won the re
gard of the delegation, as it is unani
mously in favor of his nomination and
will vote solidly for him. For the re
maining judgeship Judge Sweeney re
ceived 5 votes. Judge Smith received 3
and Judge Van Fleet 3.
The delegation will vote solidly for W.
H. Fellows for the nomination of State
Printer.- Another meeting of the dele
gation will be held to-day, when addi
tional candidates will be considered.
It is said that the candidacy of Charles
F. Curry and Paul P. Austin for
the nomination of Secretary of
State is objected to by some of the
members, who claim that the former is
one of the "push" of San Francisco, and
that the latter has the push behind him.
Further consideration will be necessary
before the delegation agrees on either
man.

MOREHOUSE DROPPED OUT.
But James Stanley of Mission S=*n
Jose Is Lost in the Woods.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MKXTO, Aug. 23.â James Stapley of Mis
sion San Jose is thinking hard things of
the Alameda delegation to-night. Stan
ley announced his determniation some
time ago to dispute the nomination for
Equaliser in the Third District with L. C.
M >reh< use. Stanley made a canvass of
the district and came to Sacramento
confident that he could win out from the
Incumbent. He found, however, that an
other. Brown of Calfiveras. had the in
siili- and. was more than likely to carry
off the plum. Stanley stayed in the fight
thiiUKh, but Morehouse saw fit to-day to
drop out.
To-night Stanley learned that his own
delegation showed signs of disintegra
te >n, ami his wrath rose thereat. Investi-
Kuti.in on hUÂ» part proved that he could
not count on a solid delegation, though
he still claims to hold the bulk of it. But
Stanley is nervous and feels that there is
no tt-lling to what extent the Alamedans
will be decoyed from him.

HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
. MENTO. Aug. 23.â Jacob H. Neff, the
temporary chairman of the convention,
.â¢'.'â Bits Jilready proved In a most emphatic
. manner his complete independence of rall
â¢rbad Influence.
, , ; The opportunity for the aged miner to
. . B;how his colors and to keep his promise
' .-to. be above the interference of corpora
.â¢.â¢' tioh â â  agents came this afternoon when
NefT appointed the committee on plat
.foFiw. Every possible effort was made to
â¢ - gecure. the selection of Grove L. John
â '. son -as the chairman of that committee.
â¢Railroad agents and friends, big and
small- of the Southern Pacific tried to in
duce Neff to honor Johnson with the
position, he c-oveted. Four years ago
Johnson sought and obtained the same
: 'position, and, it is said, he was so sure
â â .of receiving: the position again that he
. : made a draft of a platform that would
â¢â¢'.violate none of the pretensions of the
. raJlroad.
The ambitious lawyer, however, had
â¢ Neff with whom to deal. Neff not only
. refused to make Johnson the chairman
of .the. comm.^ee, but he positively de
: clin-ed to place the Sacramento lawyer
..on the committee at all. The friends of
Johnson and the railroad were dum
"â¢roun.di.-d. . They could not understand or
â¢.professed not to understand the obstinacy
of the presiding officer. Neff was how
"aver, .firm. He declared that as far as
' his power was concerned the railroad
. woUld have no representation in the plat
â  form committee. ,
The point was one difficult to enduro,
â as the platform and its provisions mean
â¢â¢muehto the rairroad. When the com
.â¢â : rnttiee '.met It went at once into executive
â a; â  Each member was armed witn
. suggestions offered by many people. The
â  presentation of each meant necessarily
'; considerable discussion which could be
.- : concluded more freely in private. The
pubvllc was excused, therefore, and the
.committee labored for several hours
â â¢.farming the platform upon which the
Republican party will stand for the next
'.- few.' jiionths.
. â¢ The: Results of the labors of the com
: â¢ rrilttee'on platform will be submitted to
' -the!cOnvention this morning. As already
â¢ indicated." the committee labored for
four hours in executive session. There
. .was.rriuch discussion on every article and
."section, in the platform. Sentiments of
; the/ utmost importance to the people of
:.'. ; tb*e '"State were adapted and will be pre
:''.iieivt-d to-day. The war and its issues

CALL GOT THERE AHEAD OF ALL
SACRAMENTO, Aug. 23.â The coming of The Cai! had been eagerly awaited this
morning, and as the paper was on the streets by 7:30 o'clock it was early enough for the first
delegates out of bed. No other San Francisco paper was here at that hour, and when the rest
appeared they were found to lack the complete and accurate accounts of convention preliminaries.
Hence The Call was much sought after, and its predictions, founded upon the array of facts it set
forth, were accepted as reliable. As the day progressed this judgment was proved correct.
There was a special train to bring the immense edition. It thundered along much of the
distance at the rate of sixty miles an hour. There were in charge of it the crew reckoned the best
in the service of the Southern Pacific, and every man took pride in making a record. As the train
whirled by the intervening stations people knew at once what was happening. They knew that The
Call was simply carrying out its promise to be at the capital ahead of all rivals. After the papers
had been distributed delegates expressed delight at the full and unbiased statements of the political
situation, and many were the congratulations tendered. %
It cannot be said that The Call's triumph as to time or news matter excited surprise. The
people have become so accustomed to see it outdistance rivals that the surprise would result from
any failure on its part to do so.
THE CALL'S SPECIAL
IS FIRST AT STOCKTON
STOCKTON, Au&. 23.â The Call, containing a complete
and an accurate report of the Republican State convention
at Sacramento and of the latest developments In the Dun
ning case. In both of which the people of this city are just
now Intensely Interested, was delivered here to-day an hour
and a half before the other San Francisco morning papers.
That The Call's enterprise was appreciated was demon
strated by the avidity with which the people bought the
paper.
The newsboys had The Call on the streets at 12 o'clock.
The other papers did not reach here until 1:30. Knowing
the good people of Stockton and adjoining towns would
appreciate an early delivery of their favorite paper, The
Call edition was sent to Sacramento on the special train
which carries the paper to the people of the Capitol City
and thence was forwarded on the southbound morning
train. The enterprise of The Call was commended by Its
many friends in this vicinity.

FUNERAL OF DR. J. F. MORSE.
Impressive Ceremonies Over the Re
mains of the Famous Surgeon.
The funeral of John F. Morse, the emi
nent surgeon who died Sunday morning,
took place yesterday afternoon at 2
o'clock in Masonic Temple, Post and
Montgomery streets. The services were
according to the Masonic ritual under the
auspices of Excelsior Lodge, of which Dr.
Morse was a member, and they were of
a most impressive character. The hall
was far too small to accommodate the
large number of friends present, among
whom were many of San Francisco's most
prominent citizens. The medical frater
nity was numerously represented, there
being large delegations from the State
and county medical associations, and the
American Medical Society. The San
Francisco employes of the State Board of
Health, of which Dr. Morse was chair
man, attended In a body.
There was a profusion of floral tributes,
many of them being of artistic and
unique designâ broken columns, broken
wheels, pillows, anchors, crosses, wreaths
âindicative of life's end and rest and
hope. These emblems were arranged on
eltner side of the master's chair In the
east.
Judge Carroll Cook, master of Excelsior
Lodge, conducted the services, which were
opened with the playing of Chopin's
"Funeral March" by S. D. Mayer, organ
ist. A double quartet, consisting of Ben
Clark and Alfred Wilkle, first tenors; J.
Ogilvie and S. D. Mayer, second tenors;
J. A. Larsen and J. R. Fleming, first
bassos, and J. R. Jones and J. O. Lowe,
second bassos, sang, with fine effect,
"Our Days on Earth Are as a Shadow,'
"Consolation." "Nearer, My God. to
Thee," and "Good Night, I Am Uolng
The remains were interred in Odd Fel

May Not End With Action of
Credentials Committee.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Aug. 23.â The committee on cre
dentials met immediately after the ad
journment of the convention, T. C. Hock
ing of Stanislaus presiding. Max Goldberg
of San Francisco was elected secretary.
There were two contests, one from Nev
ada County and the other from Santa
Clara. On motion of Ross of San Mateo
it was decided to only allow one repre
sentative from each side to argue the
merits of the several cases.
The contest from Nevada County was
first taften up for consideration.
Nat P. Brown and John F. Kidder both
claimed the seat as delegate at large
from Nevada County. Brown was ap
pointed by the County Central Commit
tee and K'idder was elected at a primary.
Kidder contended that he was entitled
to recognition, having been elected at a
primary and that primaries were ordered
by the State Central Committee where
convenient. ,
Great interest was taken in the matter,
both sides being represented by counsel.
A. J. Bruner appeared on behalf of Kld
der, while Brown was represented by
Judge Walling.
The dispute grew out of a mistake made
by the County Central Committee In call-
Ing a primary for the election of delega
tions to the State Convention. Nevada
County Is entitled to eleven delegates,
while by an oversight only ten were
elected. The Central Committee then met
In caucus and appointed Brown as dele
gate at large. Kldder had a primary on
his own a< ount, printing the names of the
other ten delegKes previously elected on
the ballot. After listening to arguments
for fully half an hour the commltee de
cided not to recognize either of the con
testants. It was decided, however, to al
low the other ten delegates to cast eleven
votes for the county.
The committee then took up the con
test made by the Good Government
League against the seating of the Jim
Rea delegation from Santa Clara Coun
ty. Samuel G. Tompklns acted as sDokes
man for the contestants. He went into
the details of the primary, and by means
of affidavits sworn to by prominent cltl
ze.is of Santa Clara, showed that the
Rea or "gang" ticket was elected by
means of ballot-box stuffing. In some
cases representative voters who were
known to be members of the Good Gov
ernment League were refused the privi
lege of voting because they would not
make oath that they would support the
"gang" ticket.
W. A. Bowden replied on behalf of the
Rea delegation. He said that there was
no proof that the alleged frauds In any
manner effected the result of the elec
tion. He claimed that the Rea faction
carried the election by 1940 votes, and
that consequently the few cases of al
leged fraud could not have In any man
ner changed the result. In answer to
the charge that many Democrats voted
at the primary, Boden said that it was
true that former Democrats voted, but
he claimed that they became Republicans
during the last campaign.
In conclusion he offered the affidavits
of several of the election officers denying
all the allegations of fraud and crook
edness. William Beasley followed in an
extended speech in which he scored the
Good Government League. He claimed
that it was the intention of the mem
bers to hold a municipal convention in
Ban Jose on the 27th lnst. and indorse a
number of Demorfrats.
Chairman Hocking said that while ho
was satisfied that fraud had been com
mitted in Santa Clara County, he did not
think the evidence sufficient to warrant
the unseating of the Rea delegation. He
was of the opinion that the Rea delegates
should be sea'ed. bwt that a report should
be forwarded to the State convention con
demning the political methods of Santa
Clara.
George Ross of Redwood City spoke In
favor of a recommendation being made
to the convention that rules be passed
providing for the regulation of the
primaries. He also favored seating th<>
Rea delegates. Ross said in conclusion
that he believed a resolution should bo
adopted by the committee calling the at
tention of the convention to the crooked
political methods employed at the pri
maries. The motion was voted down, and
Ross will prepare a" resolution and pre
sent it himself, requesting that some
means be devised for preventing frauds
at primaries.
On motion of Colonel T. V. Eddy a de
'â islon was reported to seat the Rae
delegates.

CALL, HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. Aug. 23.â The Good Government
League people are hopeful that they will
be able to obtain recognition before the
State Convention. They are making a
strong and determined fight, and will If
tlon to prove that the primary in Santa
Clara County was carried by Rea and
his ring by means of ballot-box stuf
fing and wholesale repeating. The Com
mittee on Credentials will be asked by
them to unseat the Rea delegates, and
if that course is not taken there will be
a struggle made to have the committee
report rejected. One of the strongest
documents being used against the Rea
delegation is the following circular ex
pressing the views of the San Jose Min
isterial Union:
SAN JOSE, August 22. 1898.
To the Republican Convention of California,
Sacramento. Cal.â Gentlemen: Whereas, it has
come to cur knowledge through the unim
peachable testimony of some of our own mem
bers that at the Republican primary election
held in Santa Clara County August 10, 1898,
Intimidation, Irregular voting and gross frauds
were perpetrated by the political ring under
the lead of the â¢'boas," James W. Rea. whereby
Republicans In the opposition were prevented
from voting, a large number of Democrats
were permitted to vote, and In other ways the
vote of the delegates put up by the "ring"
was very largely Increased; and whereas, this
procedure Is in keeping with the spirit and
methods of said "toss" and "ring" in the
past whereby our public schools in San Jose
have been prostituted for political purposes,
the officers of our city and county made sub
servient tools, and many business interests in
timidated; and, whereas, the continuance in
power of this body of corrupt politicians le a
menace to the Integrity and success of the
Republican party in this county, a danger to
good government, and jeopardizes every moral
interest In our community; and whereas, the
seating ot the delegates to your convention,
elected by the corrupt methods above desig
nated, will not only sanction such practices,
but tend to keep said "ring " In power; there
fore,
Resolved, That we. the Pastors' Union of
San Jose, representing the Protestant Min
isters of this city and its suburbs, in public
meeting assembled, this 2Cd day of August,
18M8, do enter our most solemn protest against
the recognition of said delegates as the repre
sentatives of the Republican party of Santa

MONTGOMERY AVENUE BONDS.
THE dismissal on Monday by United States Cir
cuit Judge Morrow of the ancient suit brought
many years ago to compel the Board of Super
visors to levy a tax for the liquidation of Montgomery
avenue bonds marks the conclusion of one of the
most remarkable cases known in the history of San
Francisco. A greater municipal swindle was never
perpetrated, and yet it cannot be said that the blame
was ever successfully fastened upon anybody. The
scheme from the first conceived and executed itself.
The history of the affair is worth recounting, since
it conveys a lesson that should not be lost. Over
twenty years ago somebody suggested that an avenue
should be cut through to North Beach, diagonally
from Montgomery street â a region which at that time
was the center of business and municipal activity. A
discussion of the idea at once caused its general adop-
tion. The pioneers railed at the shortsightedness of
those who had laid out the city without such an ave
nue, and the newspapers demanded immediate action
by the Legislature. At one time it seemed as though
North Beach would secede unless the avenue were
immediately projected.
The agitation resulted in the passage of a law which
authorized the opening of Montgomery avenue, the
formation of an assessment district, the condemnation
of the necessary property and the awarding of the
consequent benefits and damages. This statute pro
vided that the work might be started upon the filing
of a petition in the County Court, signed by the own
ers of a majority of the property, measured by front
feet, affected by the improvement. Such a petition
was filed instantly, commissioners were appointed,
surveys were made and assessments were levied.
Almost before the people of North Beach could
wink the street contractors were at work, paving,
sidewalking and sewering Montgomery avenue. Real
estate went up all along the line of the back yards
which had been turned into corner lots by the scheme
and things at North Beach boomed. Then came the
crash. Somebody refused to pay an assessment. The
proceedings for the opening of the avenue were taken
into court, and it was found that the petition which
was intended to confer jurisdiction on the County
Court was insufficient. A majority of the frontage
was not represented. A corporation had signed by
its president and secretary without authority of its
board of directors. rThe courts thereupon declared
the entire bond issue invalid.
The bondholders, many of whom were property
owners whose real estate had been taken, have been
endeavoring ever since to recover their money. Their
last resort was the United States courts. There an
action has been pending for nearly twenty years.
Judge Morrow has at last disposed of it by dismissal,
and the opening of Montgomery avenue has been
finally consummated without cost. The entire result
may be summed up with the verdict that often attends
railway accidents â nobody to blame. Yet, neverthe
less, the holders of the bonds were the victims of a
cold-blooded robbery.
According to Private Healy, a Manila correspon
dent of The Call, the soldiers have learned to hate
the natives as cordially as they do the Spanish. The
way Agiiinaldo's men have acted does not tend to
excite a fraternal feeling for them, and a few of them
Tonld get hurt without exciting any emotion akin to
sorrow.
One purpose of the society formed by the Army of
Santiago is that the records of the war shall be pre
served. Probably Mr. Hearst would like a copy of
those records to put on file, provided they contain a
dispassionate account of the artistic manner in which
his outfit was bounced from Cuba.
There may be excuse for a poor vagrant, but there
isn't for a rich- one. Judge Conlan did well to send
Miser Cunningham to jail for six months, but the
old skinflint ought to be charged fancy price for
board.
China has been having a rebellion for quite a while
now. and the killing of a few hundred soldiers is a

Cator's announcement that he has been forced out

I THE PREFERENCE OF THE DELEGATES
"T""HOSE who look upon California as a glorious
! whole have their sentiments satisfied by the
* temper shown by the hundreds of representative
citizens, delegated to the Republican State Conven
tion. To them there is only one "locality," and that
is California. In casting about for a standard bearer
[for the party's ticket and principles in the impending
fight, one hears the Jeffersonian qualifications put
-forward to the exclusion of geography and the points
!of the compass. Is he competent? Is he honest? Is
he a supporter of the constitution, with a record of
i fidelity to the party and its tickets, State and local?
i arc the questions asked about the different aspirants
1 for the high honor'and hard duty which the com
; mission of the convention will lay upon its choice.
Has he the dash of Dewey and the intrepidity of
J Hobson? Can he take the enemy's range, stay be
! yond it and sink him? These are the qualifications
! required and the nominee may be confidently expect
j ed to have them.
The search among candidates for the one most
! nearly conforming to what the convention seeks and
this people will indorse has still, during every one
of the last twenty-four hours, led delegates to the
| standard of Mr. Gage. It is now evident that if he is
i to be beaten here it must be by a man who can now
be proved to have these qualifications in a higher de
gree. The situation on his side is singularly free from
trading, bartering and combination. The practical
I politician may sneer at this as poor politics. But it is
| the essence of honorable politics. A candidate who
carries a trading stock into the convention, to be
nominated by swapping votes which come to him not
on his merits, but because he can give an equivalent,
is not chosen on account of his fitness, but because
of qualifications in which every apple woman is hisr
equal and every horse jockey his superior. The Re
publican party is in no mood to turn a convention
into a bargain counter. Its responsibility is too great,
its duty too serious, to set up a junk shop. The peo
ple want stability, statesmanship, presence, address
and trained talents, in the candidate, to the end that
dignity and regard for the public welfare may char
acterize the State administration which they propose
to install in power. The cool heads in the Republi
can party know and feel this popular demand, and do
not propose to make the choice of a candidate for
Governor contingent upon ability to trade votes for
State Printer, or any other office.
These sentiments and the sense of the situations
j so far have led to a constantly growing consideration
and respect for the claims of Mr. Gage's friends in
' his behalf, and his fight, made without bosses, back
j ing or push from any source except the impetus of
; his conceded merit, has been a gaining fight to this
I time.
fJN IRISH CHALLENGER.
rROM across the water comes a challenge to the
yachtsmen of this country to defend once more
the America's Cup, which is now by far the
most famous trophy in the annals of yachting. The
challenge has been brought to this country by the
Honorable Charles Russell, son of Lord Russell of
Killowen, and he is quoted as saying he is confident
it will be accepted and the details of the race speedily
arranged.
A novel interest is given to the proposed match
by the fact that the challenge comes this time from
Ireland. Sir Thomas Lipton, who is backing the en
terprise and will provide the yacht of the challengers,
is reported by his agent to have long been of the opin
ion that as both England and Scotland have repeat
edly tried to win back the trophy and failed, it is
time Ireland should make the attempt. The contest
ing yacht, therefore, is to be built in Irish shipyards,
named the Shamrock and manned by an Irish crew.
The wrangle that followed the attempt of Lord
Dunraven to win the trophy in 1895 resulted in dis
gusting a large number of Americans with the whole
business. At that time there was a fervent hope in
many quarters that there would never be another in
ternational contest. The ill feeling of that time, how
ever, has passed away, and there will be a general
satisfaction in having another race. The rivalries of
the past have done much to improve the art of yacht
building, and there is little doubt that further im
provements will result from future contests.
The history of the cup is a remarkable one. In
1 85 1 the Royal Yacht Squadron of England offered
for competition, open to yachts of all nations, a
trophy known as the "One hundred guineas cup." It
was won by an American yacht called the "America,"
and ever since has been known in this country as
"the America's cup." Nine times attempts have been
made to win the trophy from us, but in every match
the Americans have been successful", and the contest
has now reached a point where each renewal of the
attempt excites the keenest interest in both countries.
The struggle for the cup has, in fact, become the
greatest sporting event in the history of the world.
Where there is so much excitement and such large
betting there naturally results more or less ill feeling.
Some people lose their tempers whenever they grow
excited on any proposition, some get angry in every
contest with a foreign rival, and some are naturally
surly and show a disposition to fight whenever they
get a chance. While these people are always more
or less conspicuous in the discussions that follow
international matches, they represent but a small
portion of any Anglo-Saxon community. Both in
America and in Great Britain there is a genuine fond
ness for sport and the fair play that sport necessitates.
Therefore the approach of a new contest in the pro
longed rivalry for the great cup will be hailed with
general satisfaction, and once more the cry will go
up, "May the best yacht and nerviest seamen win!"
If Shafter returns to California there will doubtless
be a great reception in his- honor. And it is just as
certain that the paper which has devoted itself to
vilifying mm w '^ claim the credit for any demon
stration, since it will be unable to prevent the dem
onstration.
When the Post prints the head: "The Poisoner
Will Soon Be Behind the Bars," and uses such type
that the apparent statement is "The Poisoner Behind
Bars," the Post in its feeble way has gone into
the bunko business.
When those speculative Englishmen who are about
to start out after a ship laden with pearls shall have
found it, a castle in Spain would be a good place to
store the treasure.
There should be every effort to catch the brute who
killed the elk at Golden Gate Park. Such a fiend at
large is a menace to the safety of the community.
Enough naval captains are on the sick list to dem

Probably an American vessel can now go to Havana

There should be no delay in squelching the scheme
to have bloomer girls or any other girls acting as

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 24, 1898.
WE directed attention a short time sgo to a
report from Salt Lake that the Silver Repub
licans of Utah had closed up their State head
j quarters and were about to abandon further attempts
! at a campaign of education in support of their freak
! monetary policy. News now conies from Seattle that
a similar condition of affairs prevails there. The men
; who followed the Silver Republican leaders in Wash
| ington during the Bryan campaign are returning to
their allegiance to the party of protection and sound
money, and the leaders themselves, in many in
stances, are acting with the same wisdom.
The reasons for the change of sentiment among
I the misguided Republicans of two years ago are
j many. In the first place, there has been a marked
return of prosperity to the country at large and all
classes have benefited by it. This has enabled all
| except those who are willfully blind to see that the
j evils which befell the industries of the people during
! the Cleveland administration were due, not to the
1 gold standard, as the Bryanites asserted, but to the
| Democratic tariff legislation, and to the incessant
disturbances of finance and business which the agi
tations of the free traders and the silver fanatics
brought about.
As soon as it was known that McKinley had been
elected and that the Republican party would once
â  more direct the affairs of the nation, confidence was
restored, trade revived, the mills reopened, industry
resumed its work, labor and capital found occupation
for their energies, and the dawn of prosperity began
to illumine the horizon. From that time on the con
dition of the country has improved. Wheat rose
while silver continued to fall, and the main argument
of the silverites was refuted and demolished by the
resistless logic of accomplished facts.
These demonstrations in the domain of commerce
and industry served to prove the tntth and soundness
of the Republican claims during the Presidential
campaign, and led to a reconsideration of the subject
by all Republicans who had been misled into bolting
their ticket and voting for Bryan. Then came the
war with its demands for a loyal support of the ad
ministration and the army and navy while fighting a
foreign foe, and at once the great mass of the wan
derers returned to their rightful party and are now
as loyal in supporting Republicanism as they were in
the days before the silver craze of the panic years
misled them.
If to these factors there had been needed any other
i to impel the wandering Republicans of '96 to return
to their former allegiance it would have been found
in the course pursued by the Bryanites since it has
been made clear to them that they cannot make a
successful campaign this year on the silver question.
Deprived of that issue, they have gone wild in search
of others. They have raised in different States
different standards, but all of them are inscribed
with demands which tend to Populism or to outright
socialism.
Conservative men can no longer act with that
party, even if still holding to the theories of bimet
allism. The struggle is now one of settled govern
ment against the fanaticism of innovators who seek
to overthrow all existing institutions in the hope of
profiting by the spoils they may gain from the gen
eral ruin. Under conditions now prevailing it is not
to be wondered that Silver Republicans are return
ing- to their place in the ranks of the party of pros
perity, and that conservative Democrats are follow
ing them. There is no other place for any one to
go who is opposed to experimenting with socialism
in the government of this country.
NEED OF A FORESTRY POLICY.
THE revelations made by our correspondent in
the Shasta region may well command wide
spread attention. The forest acreage of Califor
nia bears more wealth than all the rest of the State,
above ground or below it. This wealth is direct, in
the money value of the timber crop standing and the
power to reproduce that crop permanently, and it is
indirect, in the value of the forests to the miner and
agriculturist as a conservator of water. It may be
said with truth that the same amount of water will
fall on the bare granite of our mountains when de
stroying the forests has stripped them of their soil
as new. But that water will flow suddenly into
the streams, converting them into torrents, and will
run rapidly away to the sea beyond recovery for eco
nomic use. The climate of the State is largely an
tfifect of the forests which clothe the mountain flanks.
When these are deforested and their soil is washed
away, physical conditions will approximate those of
the desert. The changes of temperature will be more
acute, the liability to frost in the foothill orchards
and vineyards will be greater, and vast areas, now
fertile, will lose their character and cease to yield.
If our policy of destruction is not arrested it may
be said, verily, after us, the deluge.
If we were moving blindly to these intolerable
consequences, ignorance might be some excuse. But
we have before us the example of older countries.
Moses found Palestine flowing with milk and honey,
a land full of corn and wine. Then its mountain
slopes were covered with forest and groves dotted
its plains. These are gone and the land is a desert.
Where the daughters of Shiloh danced in the vine
yards, the sore-eyed Bedouin crouches in the sand.
Tht grapes of Eschol are no more, and Naboth's
vineyard glistens in the sun, a blear desert that no
Jezebel would covet.
In all the wide stretch from the Euphrates to the
Scheldt, the same process of deforestation has been
for ages bringing on the same conditions.
Governments have now taken the alarm, and trees
are the wards of the nations, from the shores of the
Adriatic to the Bavarian Tyrol. More millions than
were yielded by the vanished forests are being spent
for their renewal. Forestry has become a profes
sional occupation. It is intelligently promoted by
Austria, Germany and France. Already natural con
ditions are reinstated by art, and the artificial forests,
as â¢ carefully harvested as a crop of bread corn, are
beginning to bring a revenue in excess of the cost of
caring for them, and in many of those countries the
forest lands promise a permanent and increasing
yield.
In this country we have too much politics, too
much discussion of party differences and too little
politic and intelligent public attention to the preser
vation of the most valuable of all our natural re
sources. What makes the difference between the
desert and the sown? Trees, and nothing but trees.
That land is most attractive to man that has forests
or the conditions for their production. We have
already pointed out the analogy between prairie and
forest conditions. Nature marked and fixed the con
ditions of fertility upon which depend the fitness of
a land for the support of life and for man's habita
tion. Man proceeds to destroy these conditions and
then bewails his lot when it is made hard by his own
ignorance and greed.
Let California be wise before it is too late, and
save the tree which is the mother of the fountain.
When the Democrats adopted their free silver
plank no question arose but they did not mean it.

VERY, VERY
POOR MUSIC.
Miller, in the principal role of thÂ«Â» young
composer with a line sense of honor, dis
covers the' duplicity of his brother, who
has stolen the music of his opera. Upon
hearing the familiar strains on which he
had lavished his best talents, he says in
tones of the utmost endearment "My poor
music," and a world of meaning is con
veyed in the three simple words.
The company was showing in a one
night stand somewhere In Oregon a short
time ago and it appears that the local
agent experienced some difficulty in gath
ering a suitable orchestra in the town
and was obliged to hire musicians of
more or less doubtful ability, some of
whom were employed in saw mills and
boiler works, so that their sense of musi
cal hearing was not as acute as it might
have been. Some seven or eight were
thus pressed into service, and the only
rehearsal they had was Just a half hour
before the performance, the opening of
the doors being delayed to give them a
chance to become familiar with the music.
When the audience had been seated the
improvised orchestra played an overture
that was simply execrable, the number
of diseased notes being unlimited. When
the play had proceeded and had reached
the point where the orchestra performs
the music that had been appropriated by
the rascally brother, Henry Miller, with
a license only accorded to a star, who
was already familiar with the discordant
strains evolved by the amateur musicians,
sadly said, "My very, very poor music,"
with a doleful, lingering accent on the
"very." Needless to state the point was
lost on the audience, but the members of
the company were almost convulsed with
suppressed laughter.

the understanding that it was for three
years, but there was a tacit understand
ing that at the expiration of two years of
that time they would, If the war was
over, be given an opportunity to leave tne
service if they desired to. When an en

deemed to be the legitimate issue of the
Indians so living together, and every In
dian child, otherwise Illegitimate, shall
for such purpose be taken and deemed
to be the legitimate issue of the father
of. such child." ________
RECONCENTRADOSâ K. L. H., Wood
land, Cal. Senator Proctor, when asked
to explain the term "reconcentrados," as
used in connection with Cuba, replied:
"All the country people in the extreme
western provinces, about 400,000- in num
ber, remaining outside of the fortified
towns when Weyler's order was issued,
were driven into the towns, the fortified
ones, and these are the reconcentrados.
They were the peasants, many of them
farmers, some land owners, others rent
ing lands and owning more or less stock,
others working on estates and cultivating
smalt patches."
Weyler's order was: "I order and com
mand that all inhabitants of the coun
try or outside of the line of fortifica
tions of towns shall, within the period
of eight days, concentrate themselves in
the towns occupied by troops. Any in
habitant who, after the expiration of
that period, shall be found in the unin
habitable portion shall be considered a
rebel and be tried as such." Other por
tions of the order directed that such in
habitants should drive their cattle into
the towns and that the order should take
effect within the eight days from the
time it was issued. In some of the places
tho inhabitants did not receive live days
notice. Weyler never made public his
reasons for the order, but it is to be
inferred that it was for the purpose of
reducing the number of those who might
join the Insurgents. * ;
PATRICIA KIRKLANDâ If the spots
on the hands are freckles apply this
wash:
Sal ammoniac (powdered), one dram;
distilled water, one pint; eau de cologne,
two fluid drams. If, however, the spots
are â  in the nature of moles, which I
strongly suspect, there is nothing that
will remove them. , The coloring matter
which constitutes these is deposited in the
deeper portion of the sub-cuticle and they
are Impossible to reach.
MRS. L. A. T.â The . distressing condi
tion of your nose must be due to some
physical indigestion of some
sort probably. Go to your druggist and
have this prescription filled: Extract of
dandelion, one dram; powdered rhubarb,
q. s. Divide into three and a half grain
pills and take one every night or oftener
if necessary. Attend strictly to the daily
sponge bath and to the diet, eating plenty
of fruit and good wholesome food, avoid
ing rich, greasy things, sweets and
pickles. Prick the white head with a fine
needle and press the contents out very
gently, else you will bruise the skin and
add to its irritated condition. / Apply
listerine, diluted in three times as much
boiled water, , for several nights. Then
mix a small pinch of borax with two
tablespoonfuls of some- good cologne and
apply for several nights. Let me know
how this treatment acts. Much patience
is required, when one starts in to de
velop the bust. First of all you must
discard all pads and be sure: that the
clothes are loose, particularly the -under
garments. â â --â¢â  Then massage >? gently; with
cocoanut oil, rubbing around and around
with the â¢palm of the hand. Do this 'every
night. It- will be at least eight weeks
before any development will be noticeable,
but It will surely come if persisted in.
Exercise with the arms will help, also
plenty of tepid baths and a diet of good
rattening foods, such as rice, butter, po
tatoes, eggs, cereals, milk and game.

BOOKS AND THEIB READERS.
The meeting of the American Library
Association at Lakewood, on Chautauqua
Lake, N. V.. on Monday, will have more
than a technical interest. The range of
topics to be discuss', i is a wide one, and
embraces almost every point of impor
tance in the collection, care and intelli
gent use of books. Especially valuable
and practical will be the addresses on the
best method of organizing classes and
schools!. for library training. Equally im
portant, perhaps, will be the discussion
by trained experts of home education
through. libraries. This is the twenty
third year of the association's existence,
and it is well within bounds to say that
every year has marked a distinct advance
in the public appreciation of libraries as
educators. There has been a notable in
crease in the number of public libraries,
and where 1 they are established it is
found that they are used with profit and
pleasure by every class in the community.
And along with the more general appre
ciation of libraries has come the belief
that if the best results from *!iem are co
be obtained they must be selected with
wisdom and judgment, and managed on
some technical and scientific system,
which at the same time will not be com
plex or confusing. Only in .this way can
a library subserve its real mission, which
is admirably expressed in the motto of the
association: .'.'The best reading for the
largest number, at the. least cost.' In
the days when reading was less general
than it is now, and before the present vast
output of books good, bad and indifferent,
It was a comparatively easy thing to es
tablish a public library. The late Rev.
Dr. Francis Vinton, of Trinity Church, In
this city, used to deliver with great ap
proval a lecture on books, in the course
of which he - described a "gentleman's
necessary library," consisting of just
twenty-five books! , â  â 
Those days of sweet simplicity are gon<
forever, and even the bare catalogue . ol
the books which the average Intelligent
man would like to read would make a
goodly volume. In the field of general lit
erature the horizon has been immeasure
ably widened since the accession of Queer
Victoria, while at the same time the in
dustrial arts and the countless divisions
of. modern science haye t each ; producet
their quota of books which. If not destinec
to an immortality of fame, are yet rsefu
to a large number of people. Moreover
every day is adding to the mountain o:
books in the world. And of these some
at least, may have a oef manent value
Indeed, the -modern reader is very-mucl
like the modern editor; he is obliged U

WOMEN AS LIBRARY WORKERS
In the first ten years of its existence,
from 1887 to 1898, of the 217 students who
matriculated from the New York State
Library School forty of the graduates
were men, and 177 were women. Of four
other prominent library schools there
have been none but women students from
the first. Women are monopolizing li
brary positions, as well as filling the li
brary schools. To be a successful libra
rian proper training is aa necessary as
in any other profession, and librarians
are chosen more and more from the ranks
of library graduates, and the libraries
throughout the country are fast coming
under the management of women. In
such prominent libraries an those of Yale,
Columbia, the Public Documents Library
of Washington, and the Newberry Li
brary of Chicago, women graduates of li
brary schools nave been very succfssful
in the work of cataloguing and classifica
tion. In the large Western cities women
are more frequently found holding the
position of chief librarian than in the
East, although Mrs. Ellen Coe-Rylanoe
has been for fourteen years director of
the New York Free Circulating Library,
while in Hartford a woma.n has held "a
similar position.
PARISIANS ARE QUEER.
For some time past it has been decided
to pull down all the Paris prisons, except
La Saute (conducted on the most approv
ed modern lines), and to rebuild them
somewhere in the provinces. Mazas Pris
onâthat gloomy structure just opposite
the Gare de Lyonâ has of late been util
ized solely for the confinement of per
( sons on remand. Its numerous cells, ar
ranged on the circular system, were in
most cases empty, and as remanded pris
oners cannot be subjected to the same
stringent discipline as convicted crimi
nals they had fallen into a dirty and neg-
I lected state. The authorities have made
! the final blunder of throwing the prison
I open to those members of the public who
might wish to visit it from curiosity. The
consequences have been deplorable. Only
eight warders were left behind in the
prison for the purpose of showing visitors
round, and doubtless they ..counted upon
! a plentiful harvest of tips. But of the
i 400 odd persons who presented themsel\ es
1 at the prison door in the guise of visitors
â¢ on the day that the ancient building was
thrown open all except two or three were
.ex-convicts and malefactors .whose ob
i ject it was to "make hay amid the sur
i roundings of their former conflnement.
They rushed in a body along the corri
1 dors, "from cell to cell, raising a terrible
din, and breaking everything they could
lay their hands on. Doors were reduced
to splinters, windows were smashed, the
few? trees planted in the prisoners exer
cise yard were torn up. and finally the
mob divided into two armies and fought
! "nlayful battle with brickbats and
i stonet. The condemned cell In particular
was wrecked, and its wal> covered with
! Seized the two or three
respectable visitors who had i been ad
saÂ£Â«he warders had been overpowered).
' and ultimately the prison was c eared by
la strong body of police. It will he kept
closed in future.-Pall Mall Gazette.
THE MODEST MT7LE.
â  Perhaps no living creature has been the
victim of more odium and derision than
the Government mule, and yet this worthy
'< animal has many traits which commend it
Ito Uncle Sam. Recently the War Depart
j ment issued an order for the purchase of
I 1000 of the long-eared beasts, and a St.
j Louis paper makes the boast that Mls
'â â  souri will furnish the great bulk of thesÂ«
valuable recruits. An army officer of con
siderable experienceâ experience both wltn
i people and mulesâ supervises the purchase
:of the animals. Three classes are want
'< cd. First, the heavy "wheelers, " which.
' will be next. to the wagons, and then the
! "swing" mules, to be hitched in the cen
1 ter of the team, while last come the llgnt
i mules, which will serve as leaders. It
! Is not every mule that can pass muster,
â¢ and the red tape incident to army enllst
! ment applies rigorously to these unpre
â  tentious creatures. By the time the ex
â â  perts get through with the mules, the lat
ter, if gifted with conversational powers,
I could boast of physical .perfection and
| perfect dental equipment. Amiability, too,
i is considered, and a beast that shows a
I tendency to kick is barred the opportunity
of serving his country.
When a mule Is accepted a numeralâ
either 1, 2or 3â3 â is stamped with a hot iron
on its hoof to denote the class to which It
Is assigned; and last, but not least, the
significant letters, "IT. 5.," are singed
upon its side. Although the operation is
not particularly painful, the markings re
main throughout the life of the animal,
! and thereby it acquires a lasting badge or
i honor and an entree into army circles.â

ARE WORKING
FOR McFARLAND
With Their Aid He Hopes
to Influence Delegates
in Convention.
The Latter Apparently Desire to
End Southern Pacific Dom=
ination in Politics.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA-]
: J'EXIO, Aug. 23.â As was indicated in
these dispatches yesterday the political
. bureau of the Southern Pacific Company
Is making: a desperate and well sustained
attempt to dominate the acts of this con
. veritlon in the matter of the selection of
candidates, for Associate Justices of the
: Supreme-Court. This Is particularly true
. wtth reference to T. B. MoFarland. who
. desires to- succeed himself on the Supreme
'â¢'â  bench-, and who has called forth the full
â  Strength of his friends In the yellow
building at the corner of Montgomery
' .anfl Market streets, San Francisco, to aid
â  him' in securing the nomination.
MvFarland's railroad supporters and his
personal f ritnds have for the past two
been moving heaven and earth to
perfect- some combination whereby they
â might overcome the evident desire on
. the part of the majority of the delegates
..to this convention to shut the Southern
Pacific ' Company and kindred corpora
tions out of Republican politics and put a
â  final end â to the corruption that has
marked the railroad's participation In
State polities'.
Iji their efforts to do so they have come
' out. in the. open and are making little or
â  ,rio attempt to conceal the fact that they
' .are: desirous of securing the nomination of
/JSlcFarland.
â¢â '.There' is much comment among the as

â  ; per" .Iri which McFarland is attempting to

â¢through the medium of the Southern Pa

BROWN AND FLINT WITHDRAW.
: .CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRAMENTO, Aug. 23.â L. H. Brown,
:â '. â :', Who was a candidate for Governor, closed his rooms at the Capitol Hotel
to-night and retired from the contest. Many of the delegates on whose
: :BUj>port he had counted asked to be released from their promises to sus
. tain his cause as there was no chance of his success. Some of the dele
agates who were in Brown's camp this morning are now wearing Gage
...badges. Before his retirement f rom tne field Mr. Brown sought consola
tion at the headquarters of Henry T. Gage and presumably obtained it.
: The retiring candidate did not make a long explanation of his course.
When his reasons for getting off the track were solicited he replied:
"Without the delegation from Alameda County or any delegation from
San Francisco it was utterly impossible to break the slate. I had about
. .250 delegates. In my judgment xxr. Gage will be nominated by acciam-
lam not a candidate for any other office on the ticket. I wish to
thank my friends for their loyalty and kind efforts. Had the convention
been go-as-you-please I am satisfied I would have been nominated. I
honestly hope the ticket will be successful, for I am a consistent Repub
: lican. I anticipate a falling off in the vote, due to decreased registra
; ition and a lack of enthusiasm as a result of the nervous reaction fol
lowing the war. Which party will lose by the decreased vote it is impos
sible to state. Had I received the nomination I am satisfied I would
have been easily elected, because I received more votes in 1894 in the
same Congressional District than did Maguire, who was a candidate for
. Congress and is the present Democratic-People's party nominee."
.': . .^Brown's retirement will not introduce any complications. It will give
!Mr. Gage additional strength in several of the mountain counties and
: insure the nomination of the Los Angeles man by a larger majority than
was first counted on.
â  â â '.. â '';. Thomas Flint Jr. withdrew from the gubernatorial contest to-night
also, and 1 his name will not be presented to the convention. He gave as
his reasons for withdrawal the apparent hopelessness of his candidacy
'.'â 'j '.against the landslide of votes that has been pouring in upon Henry T.
v.Crage. He declared that he had withdrawn without prejudice and that
: - â '."'ss had made no attempt to influence his friends and supporters in the
interest of either Gage or Pardec,

ration inNuence oF any kind controls the convention over which I now have
the honor of presiding, and I can say Further that no attempt has been made,
so far as my knowledge extends, on the part of any corporation or railroad
company to get control of the convention. The best evidence that the dele
gates are seeking to represent the people is the fact that they came here
divided in preference for the candidates. Dr. Pardee has a strong following
of earnest friends. L. H. Brown is also sustained by his friends. Henry T.
Gage has likewise a considerable number of supporters.
The preponderance of sentiment among the delegates is anti-railroad
and anti-monopoly. My election as temporary chairman does not signify the
triumph of any candidate for the gubernatorial nomination. It was in no
sense a test vote in this respect.
For example, the Placer delegation which cast its vote for me is divid
ed, and three of the aspirants for the nomination for Governor will receive
votes in this delegation. I speak of Placer because it is my home. In the
contest between the candidates for the first place on the ticket it is no
man's fight to-night.
Judging the convention by the character of the men composing it I
have no doubt the delegates will give expression to the will of the people,
and I sincerely hope and believe that a ticket will be Dlaced in the field
that will command the support of a great majority of the voters of California.
Ed at the polls even at the expense of
other candidates who might be carried
down with him. Such expressions oi
opinion come from delegates from many
portions of the State and are representa
tive of the general feeling regarding rail
road ccftididates.
Many go so far as to say that they
would prefer to see the entire ticket de
feated rather have the corporations '
secure the election of a single candidate, j
These men assert that it is well known ;
that McFarland has for years been a
friend of the railroad company, and that
the public has suffered because of this
friendship.
They look upon the present barefaced
attempt of the railroad's political bureau
to again force McFarland into a seat on
the Supreme Bench as a piece of assurance
.exceeding anything yet attempted in that
line. In spite of all of tnls talk and con
demnation the railroad still maintains
In this city its corps of managers, clerks
and confidential secretaries sent here
from San Francisco last Sunday to ft id
in the work of securing for McFarland
the nomination for Associate Justice of
the Supreme Oourt. The situation is one
that is calling for the most serious con
sideration on the part of leaders of the !
party.
From present Indications it appears
that the feeling of resentment felt aer.iinr-t
the Southern Pacific Company will result
in the nomination of Judse W. C. Van
Fleet and Judge B. T. Williams -if Ven
tura. The Los Angeles delegation has
pledged Its strength to Judge W. N.
Clark of Los Angeles, but it is believed
that nfter the firsr few ballots, when it
becomes apparent that Clark has no show
of winning, the votes of the Los Angeles
delegation will bo given to Judtje Wil
liams. Other candidates for the Supreme
Court nomination are still in :h.? <l^ht.
but their chances of winning are not good.
Btantlally agree In nil matters relating In any
way to the functions of the office of Governor
and that they are not In any respect Inconsis
tent.
I desire In this connection again to express
my earnest appreciation of the rreat honor
conferred upon me by your convention, and to
assure you of my full sympathy with the pur
poeea for which the People's â¢ party and the
Silver Republican party have united In hon
orable co-operation with the Democratic party
In the present campaign.
Further assuring you that I will faithfully
anil earnestly devote myself to the accomplish
ment of those common purposes. I remain, sin
cerely yours, JAMES O. MAGUIRE.

908 Broadway, Aug. 23.
Another bomb was thrown Into local
politics to-day when the "Hllborn cam
paign committee," which, however, does
not Indicate Its personnel definitely, pub
lished a lengthy statement regarding the
certificates of registration which it is
claimed County Clerk Jordan Issued In or
der to favor Mr. Metcalf's candidacy.
The committee states: "At that time
(before the primary) our committee could
not get possession of any of these cards,
owing to the fear of those who gave the
information that they would be involved
in the expose and the further desire to
shield some of the deputy clerks who
signed the cards." The statement of the
committee la illustrated with reproduc
tions of two certificates signed, one by
R. C. Gelder, and another by J. G. Deane,
a deputy county clerk, for the produc
tion of which Mr. Jordan offered a reward
of $50. The committee does not state
whether or not this reward will be claim
ed. It says that "the law never contem
plated such use of certificates of registra

The Attendance Increasing and the
First Week Proving a Great
Success.
The opening event at the Irish Fair last
evening was the grand march, led by
Erin, represented by Mrs. F. E. Dunne,
and Uncle Sam, personated by Robert
Emmet Lynch, the promenaders keeping
step to the music of Bennett's Exposition
Band.
The theater, in which is located the art
gallery, drew full houses at each perform
ance, the bill consisting of scenes from
"The Honeymoon." "Marie Stuart" and
"Camille," with vocal solos, dueta and
recitations interspersed, the programme
being under the direction of Mtk. Ludlam.
The booths did a thriving trade, and all
the other attractions were liberally
patronized. The attendance was much
larger than on Monday night. The first
week Is proving a gratifying success in
every respect. The paid admissions so
far are more than ever known at any ex
position held In the Mechanics' Pavilion
during the same length of time. The

last Wednesday, and It Is to be hoped by |
every lover of good government that such j
an outrageous prostitution of a high of- I
fice to the schemes of ward heelers will
never again be witnessed in this county." ;
"This committee has no desire to injure
Mr, Jordan nor cast any reflections pub
licly on his office. His repeated challenges ;
and mlsstatements would place us in a
false lifrht. however, if we did not pub
lish the facts as we know them and afford
the public an opportunity to reach a ver
dict, and place the responsibility for the
wrong inflicted, where it properly belongs.
Our work is ended and we shall take no
further notice of Mr. Jordan nor of what
he may say."
This significant phrase "we shall take
no further notice of Mr. Jordan" may
mean a great deal to the county clerk's
future. The article which Is published In
Dr. Pardee's organ is headed "Hllborn's
friends." In the Seventh Ward Hllborns
friends, as shown at the primary, were
only in the minority by twenty-four, an.l
should they take "no further notice of
Mr. Jordan" at the primary on Septem
ber 17, a different complexion may be
placed on counts* politics.

To Locate the County Boundary.
On Thursday morning, August 25, the
engineers representing San Francisco and
San Mateo counties will commence the
resurvey of the boundary line between
the two counties. San Francisco will be
represented by Mr. Tilton. the City En
gineer, and San Mateo County by the
County Surveyor, Mr. Gilbert, and D.
Bromfleld, civil engineer.
The county boundary was last surveyed
in 1862, and stone monuments placed upon
the line. Since that time numerous
claims have ben made that the line was
established erroneously, and It is in re
sponse to these claims that the present
survey is undertaken by the two coun
ties.
Born in the Hospital.
Maggie Adams, a woman about 26 years
of age, was found in a doorway at Turk
and Laguna streets early yesterday
morning and was taken to the Receiving
Hospital in the patrol wagon, where
about two hours later she grave birth to
a girl baby. She is a domestic, but for
some months has been out of employ
ment, and lived the best* way she could.
She said that John McCarthy, formerly
a bartender In a Fourth street saloon,
was the father of the child. The babe
will be sent to Mount St. Joseph's Or

Mining Case Settled.
Judgment for the plaJntlff was rendered
in the United States Circuit Court yester
day morning in the case of Koulback vs.
Hazzard, brought to determine the owner
ship of a mine In Plumas County. Haz
zard claims that Koulback has not done
the requisite amount of work on the mine
and accordingly seized it on the Ist of
January. Koulback proved to the satis
faction of the court that he had done the
required amount of work by working on
a group of six mines, and judgment was
rendered accordingly.
Without a Prescription.
William A. Kelly, druggist at Market
and Stockton streets, was arrested yes
terday afternoon by Detective Crockett
on a warrant charging him with selling
poison without a physician's prescription.
He was released on his own recognisance

PAROEE AND
BROWN ROUTED
Continued from First Page.
Republican campaign In the platform
had been wrested from the hands of
the opposition and had fallen into the
possession of Gage. The victory had
bt;en well worth the winning. When
Jacob H. Neff subsequently announced
the committee on platform and in his
selection protected the convention and
the party from the stain even of the
suspicion of railroad influence, the
triumph was more thoroughly under
stood.
Neff struck the keynote of his policy
as soon as he took the platform to
thank the convention for the honor be
stowed upon him. He vigorously as
serted his freedom from boss and rail
road influence, Ills public life has been
such that he needed to' make no such
assertion, but the announcement won
the recognition and hearty response of
applause and cheers. When Neff had
concluded "Â»s address the convention
began its labors. The first and one of
the greatest battles of the convention
had been won and lost. The opponents
of Gage had combined their forces in
vain.
The results of this foolhardiness be
came manifest as soon as the conven
tion took a recess for the rest of the
afternoon. Pardee's managers, who suf
fer from inexperience, saw at once that
their favorite was not only sadly in a
minority, but that they had made a
fatal mistake in exposing their weak
ness to the common enemy. As soon
as possible after the adjournment Par
dee and his advisers held a conference
to discuss the situation. The futility
of continuing a hopeless struggle was
pointed out to Pardee and he was
urged to withdraw from the fight. By
doing this he was shown where he
might secure the favorable opinion of
his onnonents and place himself in line
for the Republican nomination four
years hence.
"It is inevitable," his advisers said,
"that Gage shall win the nomination.
This will make it reasonable to sup
pose that four years from now the
nominee will be chosen from the cen
tral or northern part of the State."
i/ardee had placed himself in line, but
all the urging was wasted on deaf ears
and he positively declined the advice
of his followers and will remain In the
Held.
His obstinacy had its counterpart in
the actions of General Dickinson and
Judge Angellotti, the former of whom
wished to be Governor and the latter
â¢Supreme Justice. Dickinson saw in the
events of the afternoon the destruction
of his hopes. He decided therefore to
retire from the field as srracefully as
possible. In doing so he promised to
throw his strength to Charles F. Curry
for Secretary of State.
Judge Angellotti determined upon the
same policy so that Curry will receive
an unexpected support and an added
strength for the battle in the conven
tion. Neff's victory and the bearing it
has had on the aspirations of other
candidates have sent several claimants
for honors to hasty cover. The guber
natorial contest being over the other
prizes are being sought for with re
newed vigor.

Mrs. Dorn Fuhrig was arraigned in

McGOWAN'S OPINION.
He Will Remain in the Fight
for the Lieutenant Gov
. ernorship.
SACRAMENTO. Aug. 28.â 1 be
came a candidate for the nomina
tion of Lieutenant Governor at the
solicitation of a number of my
friends, and I propose to stay in
the fight until the last vote Is
given. I will not withdraw from
the contest under any circum
stances whatever. I believe that I
am entitled to recognition at the
hands of the party on the score of
party service rendered at all times
without compensation. I have had
ten years' experience in the Legis
lature and do not believe that I
am boasting when I Bay that I am
qualified to discharge the duties
of the office. If nominated I will
make an active campaign and
spare no effort to secure the elec
tion of the whole ticket.
In view of the fact that the
fusion party has nominated a bril
liant politician and orator, I anti
pate that the coming campaign
will be one of argument.
I trust it will be a campaign
whore the. discussion of principles
will be paramount. I think a good
ticket will be nominated and will
be successful. I have engaged in a
recalcitrant movement known po
litically as a "kick" when I
thought that I observed the ap
pearance of a "slate," but I have
reason to believe that such politi
cal methods have been abandoned.
I only want an open fight, and if
I am not considered the best man
for the position I do not want the
nomination. Whatever the result
may be, I will loyally and actively
support the nominees and sustain
the principles of the party. I may
be a "kicker" but never a sore
head. FRANK M'OOWAN.

made Itself felt at State conventions.
Among the fourteen candidates who are
either actively or passively seeking the
nomination are many who have un
assailable records as jurists. There are
others whose records are not so clean,
and whose connection with the manipu
lators of the affairs of the Southern
Pacific Railroad Company are matters
of common knowledge.
The efforts that are being put forth
by the railroad company, through its
political bureau, to secure the nomina
tion of at least one of these men, would
be beyond belief, were it not for the
fact that the people have become
somewhat accustomed to the partici
pation of the railroad in political af
fairs. Whether or not the corporation
will, hi this instance, be permitted to
carry its design to a successful issue
and thus secure for itself a representa
tive in the highest tribunal of the
State, of course remains with the dele
gates to this convention to decide. It
seems quite possible that they may de
cide in favor of the railroad company,
and if they do, the voters of the State
will then have an opportunity to ex
press their approval or disapprobation
of the action of the convention.
Local Sacramentans have been treat
ed to-day to an illustration of how pol
itics "is did" In Alameda County. Dr.
Pardee came to the convention in the
vanguard of a delegation composed of
the young men who made up for thetr
lack of political knowledge by an over
exuberance of spirits that has found
vent on every possible occasion, in and
out of season. With an idea of catch
ing the nimble country vote, they have
marched up the street, singing and
shouting, and then marched down
again shouting and singing as if they
were never tired of it. This exhibition
always wound up by a demonstration
beneath the windows of their candi
date's headquarters at the Golden
Eagle Hotel, and then the populace was
treated to an edifying spectacle of
youthful enthusiasm, such as was good
to see. But it was not politics.
Dr. Pardee would appear at his win
dow and wave his thanks, but he must
have been disappointed by always see
ing the same familiar faces turned up
to himâ their very familiarity proving
that they had gained no recruits, and
instead of making votes were merely
making a noise.
There is some prospect that the work
of the convention will be finished some
time to-morrow night, but this will de
pend largely upon the length and num
ber of nominating speeches. A goodly
number of more or less celebrated ora
tors have gathered here for the purpose
of presenting to the ear of the country
delegates in convention assembled the
irresistible charms of various candi
dates. To-day's events will, however,
materially reduce the number of these
political orators, for the reason that the
candidates for whom they were to
nominate have retired from the race,
and will be disappointed but silent
spectators of the proceedings that mark
the closing day of the convention.
No fewer than 1173 persona have been
buried In Westminster Abbey.

Special Correspondence of The Call.
BY PRIVATE FRED A. HEALY.
CAVITE, July 14.â This is not the
local room of a paper. One has to get
his Information as to the date of de
parture of the different mails as best
he can. and as they generally leave
about two days ahead of schedule time
he haH to do the best he can in the few
minutes allowed him between the
periods of his military duty to get his
.correspondence written.
This is not the only epistolary dif
ficulty the young soldier has to over
come. It seems that the mail to the
United States will not be forwarded
unless the passage is prepaid. The
troops have received no money. Not
one in ten has two Mexican cents to
his name, let alone the 10 needed to
carry his letters home, and in conse
quence many a mother and sweetheart
will wonder why they do not hear from
the boy at the front.
We have been here for two weeks
now and have tasted no fighting,
though every evening the sound of
firing commences in the vicinity of
Manila, Just across the bay, and the
regiment is lulled to its sleep by the
boom of Spanish cannon on the walls
of Luzon's capital replying to the mus
ketry' attacks of the encircling bodies
of insurgent infantry.
Nearly every morning we hear re
ports of more or less serious affrays
which took place the night before and
of victories for the insurgents, which
latter report is generally confirmed by
the long line of captive prisoners
which are brought in later in the day
and Incarcerated in prisons which they
themselves built In former years for
the natives who now stand guard over
them.
Since the regiment landed Its health
as a whole has been pretty fair, though
there has been considerable doing in
the way of cramps and dysentery, and
those sores which first made their ap
pearance on the Peking, and which
were supposed to have been the result
of a too liberal use of salt water, are
still staying right with it. The indi
vidual who is unfortunate enough to
be the victim of the two disorders to
gether is anything but an object of
envy to his more fortunate fellows.
As he can eat nothing, he becomes a
sort of a cross between a military Job
and a warrior Lazarus.
The first serious accident since the
regiment landed here occurred on the
12th. "Jack" Egan, the senior corporal
of E Company, was cleaning his rifle,
when the piece was discharged, blowing
off three of the fingers on his right
hand. He is now being cared for in the
regimental hospital and will be re
turned to his home in San Francisco
as soon as his condition will permit of
his making the trip. Egan was at one
time employed in the composing room
of The Call. The accident, while very
unfortunate and much to be regretted,
can be blamed to no one but himself,
as it was entirely the result of his own
carelessness.
â¢ Colonel Smith is determined to make
good marksmen of the boys he com
mands. A few days ago he had targets
erected on those portions of the decks
of the San Juan de Ulloa and Isle de
Cuba that are above water, and last
Saturday the Third Battalion lined up
. for its initial shoot. The boys were
deeply interested in the outcome of the
competition, and good natured rivalry
between the different companies of the
battalion ran high. The ranges were
250 and 525 yards, respectively, and the
firing was done by squads and singly,
both in the erect position and lying
down. Q Company, Captain Sutliffe,
made the best score, though all acquit
ted themselves very well, the firing of
the green hands in particular being so
good as to surprise those who had
looked for a far different result from
men who in many instances had never
had a gun In their fists before in their
lives.
To-day the Second Battalion had its
target practice, and L Company, under
the command of Captain Eggett, car
ried off the honors.
En passant I might say that this
same L Company is winning a name
for itself as a crack company. Its
drill has excited the admiration of the
regulars themselves, and a number of
its men have been chosen for positions
that are generally considered the re
wards of particular excellence in army
life. Private Ward Eaton has been
made regimental clerk. Private Frank
Lanks has been promoted to the posi
tion of clerk in the quartermaster de
partment, and Privates Lawrensen and
White are to be attached to the Brig
ade Signal Corps aB soon as it is or
ganized.
One great trouble here is the lack of
sanitary facilities as regards keeping
the persons of the enlisted men in a
state of healthful cleanliness. There is
a great scarcity of fresh water in this
place. Most of that precious fluid is ob
tained from the frequent rains, and the
supply is so inadequate to the demand
that fresh water for washing purposes
is entirely out of the question. Swim
ming in the salt water of the bay was
attempted, but came to an abrupt end,
owing to a large number of sea nettle
and Jelly fish that had located in the
bay some little time before the Ameri
can occupation, and were no more in
clined to give up their territory to the
Invaders than are their pclsonous
Spanish neighbors on shore, L Com
pany and D Company, which attempted
the first bath, were stung almost to a
man. The poison of the sting, while
only transitory in its effects, is so dis
agreeable and painful in its results that
most men prefer going dirty to trying
it again. Something should and no
doubt will be done to remedy the pres
ent condition.
Another thing that the boys would be
very grateful for would be a supply of
pith helmets. The slouch campaigning
hat that seemed so light In San Fran
cisco In as heavy as lead In the humid
climate of Manila, and on a long march
would become an instrument of torture,
where hi garrison It Is merely a matter
of great discomfort.
Speaking of discomfort, when a man
wishes to enjoy thorough, unalloyed,
simon-pure discomfort let him forsake
the ease and luxury of civil existence
as a hodcarrler or stevedore and Join
the army. He'll get what he is looking
for. Art and nature both combine
a^pJnst the soldier, and the gods, the
J
elements and some men are never
propitious to the boys In blue. When it
is guard duty that has to be done rain
is the accompaniment of the lonely sen
tinel; the order for a long march is the
sure precursor of a broiling hot sun
and clouds of stifling dust on the ap
pointed day, while the taps of the tired
soldier are the reveille of the frolicsome
and omnipresent mosquito.
There is a duty known in the army
as fatigue. The first man who so called
it knew his business. In all places
where troops are to be found it stands
for the laborious duties attached to a
camp or garrison. It means the same
thing down here in a general sense and
the hold of the Peking in a particular
sense. The troops a^e forced to unload
their own stores from the vessels, and
every day a fatigue detail from each
company is sent aboard to rustle bales,
boxes and barrels in the hold of the
vessel. Such work is considered fairly
laborious when performed by men ac
customed to it and in a cold climate.
Imagine what it must be in the tropics
to men, many of whom have never
lifted anything heavier than a visit
ing-card in their lives. They stick to it
like good ones, however, and one never
hears a complaint. It seems to be
considered a matter of honor among
the boys to say nothing and perspire
until their clothes are wringing wet
and their shoes slop as they move about.
The First California is composed of
good 'uns, "an' that ain't no lie."
Drills take place twice a day and
are held in the early morning and
evening so as to escape the terrible
humidity of midday. That they are ac
complishing their object can be seen
by a man with half an eye. The im
provement in the carriage, gun hand
ling, marching and general demeanor
of the men must be very gratifying to
their officers, and I don't hesitate to
say that before the first year's enlist
ment has expired the First California
Volunteers will be able to compete and
hold their own with the best regulars
in the country or out of it. As to their
fighting qualities â well, just give them
the chance and let the result speak for
them.
Not only have they had the ordinary
garrison drills, but skirmish and re
connoitering drills have taken place
that have carried the boys of the Sec
ond and Third Battalions under Majors
Tllden and Sime many miles through
the enemy's territory and well up
toward the defenses of Manila.
The officers of the regiment are quar
tered in the houses occupied but a short
time ago by the gold-laced Dons that
Dewey sent scurrying toward Manila,
while the rank and file are occupying
the quarters left vacant by the hurried
departure of Spain's crack regiment,
the "Infantry of Marine."
The natives tell us that thirteen men
were killed in this building during the
bombardment. If this is so the boys
don't worry much about it. Every even
ing song, jest and badinage fly thick
and fast and as yet no Cestilian ghost
has seen fit to put in aji appearance at
the festivities.
The navy has presented Colonel
Smith with a fine twelve-oared bargr,
captured from the Spaniards, and it is
considered quite a privilege to be al
lowed to form one of the crew. A place
on one of the barge's thwarts is not
alone coveted for the honor of rowing
the colonel, which is not specially light
and easy work on a very hot day, par
ticularly if Lieutenant Colonel Duboce
and Adjutant Kelleher make up the
balance of the party. But as the colonel
always gives the boys a good meal at
headquarters when they miss their own
dinner hour and as they generally con
trive to miss it the work of tugging at
the oars assumes the aspect of a dis
guised blessing.
The other day one of the boys wag
sent to town to purchase some fishing
tackle for an excursion the colonel had
decided on. The fellow succeeded In
getting hooks, but was Informed by
the man who sold them that as for lines
he might as well give up his quest, as
none were to be had in the whole place.
A Spanish prisoner of officer rank, who
was standing near by, said:
"There are lots of fish lines in Ma
nila. Why don't you fellows go in and
get them?"
"We will in a few days," replied the
American, "and when we do we will
find the bait there to put on the end
of them."
The conversation then came to an
abrupt conclusion.
Speaking of prisoners, there must be
nearly three thousand of them here al
together. They receive excellent treat
ment, much better than they had been
told would be their portion if captured
by the "American savages." and the
relations existing between them and
their conquerors are of the most cordial
character. The boys stroll along in
front of the buildings in which the
prisoners are confined and try to carry
on a pleasant conversation with every
one who appears behind the bars of the
windows. As the windows are large,
and as they are always crowded to
their utmost capacity a continual con
versazione of large proportions is the
result. That it must perforce be car
ried on in two different tongues, with
the result that only one-half is intelli
gible to one party at a time, does not
seem to make the slightest difference.
The prisoners have instituted a sort of
bureau of exchange, where they and
their captors meet and through crossed
Iron bars carry on a lively traffic in
buttons, badges, gold braid, chevrons,

KINGSTON, Jamaica, Aug.

Indian sugar conference, which
is to assemble at Barbadoes Sep

testing against a sacrifice of the
colonies, Jamaica is preparing a
plebiscite to the British Parlia

promoters of this movement are
endeavoring to secure Inter
colonial co-operation, but are
not depending upon it.
of trouble between the natives and the
Americans are, for the most part, un
founded. The fact is that the insur
gents have been unwilling to disarm
until assured of the permanence of
American protection.
The distrust felt as to the Spanish
bank, which originated in rumors as
to an excessive note issue to aid the
Spanish authorities, led to a run on the
institution, but the British banking
houses came to its assistance and
averted a failure.
Business is now booming. The ob
structions in the river Pasig, which
flows through the town, have been re
moved and the water works have re
sumed operations.
DEWEY THE BOYS' IDEAL.
A Volunteer's Opinion of the Con-
queror of Montijo.
In a letter to his njother in this city
Private Andrew Rellly of the First Cal
ifornia Volunteers, writes:
Cavite is a great town to see but a
"bum" place to live in. We went through
the town and took in all the sights. In
one of the churches that the Insurgents
destroyed we found the skeleton of a
man. I suppose It was that of one of the
priests that had been murdered. We went
all through the prisons, and the Spaniards
wanted to sell us their clothes for money
to buy food with. They get very little
to eat, and most of them art- actually
starving. In the hospitals It is a terrible
sight, some of them lying there with their
limbs shot off and no care taken of them.
They lie there Just waiting for the end.
The insurgents are fighting every day.
As I write I can hear the booming of can
non a mile and a half away. Last Sunday
they fought a big battle, and all day they
were bringing their dead and wounded
through our camp on their way to town.
Out in the bay there lie eleven Spanish
warships â the result of Dewey's victory.
Oh. you bet he made a good job of it!
After what he has done I would not be
afraid to fight all the nations in the world
combined with him as a leader. With his
six ships he sunk eleven and captured two
and the city of Cavite, and if tiie war will
only last long enough he will I c of great
help in capturing Manila. After that I am
sure they will cry quits.
This regular army life Is just the thing.
I am going to enlist for life after the war
(nit). It is now raining, and I have to
stay in my tent. It Is nice to be doing
sentry duty and have a bolt of thunder
come and make you feel as if you were
hit on the head with an empty barrel.
But then, it is all in time of war, and we
volunteered to stand it all for Uncle Sam's
sake.

It Is Believed the Oregon's Com-
mander Will Regain Health.
BENTON HARBOR. Mich., Auk. 23.â
Captain TAoyA Clark, keeper of the light
house station at St. Joseph, has received
a telegram from his brother, Captain
Clark of the battleship Oregon, now at
Montauk Point, L. 1., in which he states
that he was convalescent and that his
physician says his condition is much im
proved by the few days' rest he has had
since leaving his ship. Captain Clark says
the quarantine will be raised to-day, and
he will then proceed to the Brooklyn Navy
Hospital, where he will pass a medical ex-
a Tn"view of the fact that he will probably
be detained several days at the Brooklyn
Hospital, Captain Clark has asked his
family to proceed to New York and meet
him there. After a possible short stop at
Washington the party will go direct to
St Joseph, where the captain will spend
several days visiting his brother and other
relatives and friends. < '
Lloyd Clark does not regard his broth

ILLNESS OF SCHLEY.
The Admiral too Weak to Go for a
Carriage Drive.
WESTPORT, Conn., Axis. 23.â As the
day advanced it became evident that Ad
miral Schley's condition was such that it
would be unwise for him to undertake a
proposed carriage drive. Immediately af
ter breakfast the patient returned to his
room, and when Dr. Gregory called at
noon the admiral was advised to remain
in bed most of the day.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 23.â The Navy
Department received a dispatch to-day
from Rear Admiral Schley's Â«wlfe. saying
thai in her opinion his illness was not se
rious, and that he would probably be
around in a few days. With this assur
ance there is felt to be no occasion for
substituting another name for that of the
rear admiral on the Porto Rico commis
sion.
The illness of Captain Evans of the
lowa has been reported to the depart
ment, and in his case, as well as others
where officers are sick after their long
service, leave will be granted and every
opportunity given for recuperation.

Movement
From Their Carop They Could Watch the Fight

Spaniards.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
BY SOL N. SHERIDAN.
CAVITE ARSENAL, July 15.â The
First California Volunteers, or a part
of the First, has gone to the front. At
6 o'clock this morning the First Bat
talion, consisting of Companies A, E, I
and M, under Major Boxton, the expe
dition being commanded by Lieutenant
Colonel Dv Boce, was taken across the
bay to form the camp of the advance
guard under the walls of Manila. Two
cascos, these quaint native boats which
are, I believe, unlike anything else in i
the world, were loaded with the boys
and their baggage in the short space of
70 minutes. It was not such an easy
matter to unload them at Paranaque,
near which place the camp has been
pitched, but that is a tale which does j
not come in this place. The cascos,
taken in tow by the Rapido, one of the
Spanish tugs captured by Dewey, were
towed across the bay at reasonable
speed until they came to the mouth
of the Paranaque River, and the Ra
pido ran her nose incontinently into the
mud. The cascos, like a well-trained
tow, came on as they had been taught
and smashed the stern rail of the Ra
pido into small bits. Soldiers were
packed on t,he cascos and on the lower
deck of the tug like sardines, but none
of them, fortunately, were hurt.
The captain of the Rapido, who is a
simple boatswain in the navy, cast off
his tow, and the native crews followed
the cascos into the river when the
troops were landed. In the meantime
the tug wallowed about in the mud,
finding the water in the river too shal
low to permit entrance, and the heads
of the expedition wallowed about in
deep disgust, awaiting the return of
a casco to deliver them. The move
ments of a casco are slow as the death
of a just man whose heirs wait upon
him. It came at last, and we were put
ashore and the boys who had preceded
us were got into marching order. It is
two miles from Paranaque by the road
which leads to Manila, the Calle Real,
to the camp ground chosen for the
California boys. The ground is almost
level lying between the road and the
sea, and there are groups of trees
about which will furnish abundant
firewood. The land, I believe, is rather
swampy when it rains. Whether it will
be healthy or not is an open question,
but I hardly think it is the intention
to let the boys remain there long
enough to test that. The Americans
will be in Manila, I believe, before they
have a chance to get ill. At present the ]
First Brigade will be quartered at
Paranaque, probably to make room for
the second expedition, now daily ex- ,
pected. When that expedition comes i
the forward movement, begun to-day, i
will be carried all along the line, and !
our friends the Tagals, within two |
miles of whc-se advance lines the first j
American troops in the field are now j
encamped, will have a chance to watch I
the prowess of the men who in future ;
will perhaps be their masters.
There was some heavy firing from the
Spanish lines, the big guns in the lv- j
netta being particularly active, as we j
landed at Paranaque this morning. I
The firing was not at us, although pos-
Bibly the Spanish, who must have |
known the purpose of the expedition,
were not averse to giving us a sam
ple of the kind of guns we were going
against. The Filipinos, I believe, made
an attempt to turn the right of the
Spanish line to get possession of the
suburb of Malate. Whether tjie at
tempt failed I do not know, but proba
bly it did. Aguinaldo has little artil- j
lery, and that little old fashioned and j
poorly served. His best pieces are
two old 10-inch smoothbores, j taken
from the arsenal at Cavite. If the
Spaniards knew how to shoot the least
bit in the world they would have beaten
the insurgents back long ago. Cer
tainly, in the firing this morning they
shot ten shots to one from the insur
srents for two hours.
I was out at the front for the third
time yesterday, looking over the
ground where the First is going into
camp, and approached closer to Ma
nila than upon any previous recon
noissance. , The Filipinos are coming
to guard their lines from intrusion
somewhat more jealously than at first,
but I managed, under heavy fire from
the Spanish rapid-fire gun sweeping
the Calle Real, to go around the rebel
lines and approach Manila so closely
along the beach I could see the people
bathing from the quay off the English
Club, and looking down upon the
Lunetta. could see the crowds which
throng that thoroughfare in the latfÂ»

afternoon. It was altogether the hr-st
vii-u I have had, and gave the best idea
of the capacity of the Spaniards for stub
born defense. The garrison of Manila
is fed on horse flesh, so the galley yarn
runs, and the priests control the stock
of rice on hand, nevertheless I believe
from what I have seen of the defenses
that it will be a pretty flght when the
place comes to be stormed. Life In
camp continues to be dull and
without incident, although the for
ward movement of to-day has put
heart into the boys, who desire nothing
so much as to capture Manila and get
home again.

FRAUDS" UNEARTHED
AT VANCOUVER, B. C.
Simple Device by Which the Custom
House Has for Many Years
Been Fleeced.
VANCOUVER. B. C, Aug. 23.â C. C.
Eldredg-p. recently appointed Appraispr at
Vancouver, has unearthed a conspiracy
to defraud the customs, which has been
in existence for years. While searching
the recent records of the Customs Depart
ment here found that by using
a double set of invoices Chinese and
Japanese merchants had defrauded the
Government out of thousands of dollars
through operations extending over six
years. The modus operandi was very
simple. Mongolians in the East who sent
out goods to their countrymen in the
West prepared two invoices â one for the
use of tho merchant and the other to be
used at the Customs Department. The
latter invariably misrepresented the value
of the goods.

ORDERS SENT TO
GENERAL MERRITT
Instructed to Provide Permanent
s Quarters for All Troops Now
in the Philippines.
NEW YORK. Aug. 23.â The Herald's Washington correspondent
telegraphs: Instructions cabled Major General Merritt, commanding
the United States forces in the Philippines, by Adjutant General
Corbin to-day, throw a significant side light upon the present pur
poses of the President. General Merritt is instructed to provide
quarters for all his men and is told that the question of returning
any part of them to the United states "can only be decided after a
ratification of the repo-t of the peace commission, which may be
some weeks, even months, yet."
He is even instructed to send to San Francisco all the transports
not needed for the use of his command.
This seems clearly to indicate that the President has determined
to hold territory in the Philippines which will require General Mer
ritt's entire force of 15,000 men for garrison purposes. It is argued
that if Mr. McKinley contemplated any policy that would admit of a
reduction of General Merritt's force in any way as a result of peace
negotiations, he would not direct the return of all transports not
needed for immediate use to the United States.
CHICAGO. Aug. 23.â A special to the
â Times-Herald from Washington, D. C,
.'.says: General Merritt has sent word to
â¢ -the. War Department that he needs no
. more troops. This statement was made
Mn. response to an inquiry from the

as an assurance that the American

Special Dispatch to The Call.
; â¢ ST. LOUIS, Aug. 23.â The Republican
State Convention spent the afternoon
' . listening to speeches. Webster Davis
â¢ of Kansas City, Assistant Secretary of
, the Interior, declared that the Repub
: Mean party was fortunate in having a
national administration which needed
no defense. No administration had ac-
cbmplished so much in the same space
of time. In closing, Mr. Davis said:
'.'We have the Hawaiian and the
: Philippine Islands and Porto Rico, and
we may have Cuba. That's not so bad

and the results. Colonel Kerens de
"clared that wherever "Old Glory" has
â¢ been unfurled it should never be hauled
down. He believed we should keep all
the lands acquired.
Dr. Stark Neff, secretary- of the com
mittee on resolutions, read the report
of that committee, which was adopted.
The following is a synopsis of the
. platform:
..The Republican -arty of the State of
Missouri, in convention assembled, con
' fcratulates the nation upon the unparal
leled success of the administration of
President McKinley, which has been dis
tinguished for wise statesmanship and
lofty patriotism in both its domestic and
â  foreign policy, and for the efficient man
ner in which the war has been conducted
to an early and honorable conclusion, and
we hereby express our approval of the
terms of the protocol Imposed by the
President between this country and
Bpaln as a necessary condttion precedent
as to the suspension of hostilities.
We extend our thanks to tne American
â¢ ' army and navy for their noble sacrifice
â¢ In behalf of their country and their bril
liant achievements in the Spanish-Amer
ican war.
We reaffirm our faith in the declaration
of principles of the Republican party of
1896. We are in favor of Increasing our
. navy to a size commensurate with our
expanding commerce and with the map
r.itude of the interests of this republic
which need protection. We favor an ade
?uate ayptem of harbor anu seaeoast de
ensÂ»s and the maintenance of a regular
' and a thorouefi.iy Â« quipped army, sufli-
Cient in siz? adequately to insure the de
â renpe of the nation at all times.
â¢..â¢ We are in favor of the completion and
â  control of the Nicaragua canal by the
\ United States as a necessary measure for
the protection and extension of American
â¢commerce and the perfection of otir na
tional defense. We reassert the Monroe
.â â doctrine In Its full extent as a principle
of our Tarty and we believe that the
United States should stand aloof from in
â¢ tprferonce with the affairs and disputes
of European powers when American in
t, - â  are not Involved; but we assert
that the Monroe doctrine does not compel
our government to abandon or to return
.to' the tyranny of Spanish rule any of the
â¢ '.- helpless peoples who have by force of
â¢ circumstances in the conquest of the
Spanish-American war been placed
.â¢under our protecting oare. And we fur
ther assert that the Monroe doctrine does
â '. not forbid the enlargement and exten
sion of American territory or the protec
tion of American interests In the Eastern
' as well as the Western hemisphere, espec
ially In the. - arific Ocean, where our great
coast line and the requirements of the
â¢'commercial development of our Western
' States Impose on our government cor
â¢ â â  responding duties; and we, therefore, ap
' â â¢'prove of the annexation of the Hawaiian
â¢ Islands, and we favor the acquisition and
ownership of additional naval stations?
â¢ and ports sufficient to afford ample pro
tection to our rightful and natural grow
ing eommeree with Asia and other coun
tries of the Far West. Wo believe in the
upbuilding of the American merchant
â¢ marine, and wo fuvor such legislation by
â¢ Congress as will accomplish that end.
GARCIA RUNS THINGS
WITH A HIGH HAND
.' Captures Gibara, Levies Tribute and

of Residents.
HAVANA, Aug. 28.â The Spanish cruis
er Infanta Isabel left Havana on the
such ships an you may require for trans
portation purposes. Every provision will
be made for the health of your command
and the comfort of your sick. You are
authorized to use any of the transport
ships for hospital purposes and the Naval
Hospital at Hongkong can be utilized for
the soldiers in case of necessity.
The troops of your command should be
put in camp or quarters as you decide.
The question of returning any troops can
only be decided on after the ratification
of the report of the Peace Commission,
which cannot be for some weeks, even
months. All transports not needed for the
immediate use of your command should
be ordered to San Francisco as soon as
possible. The Scandla has been furnished
as a hospital ship. The Arizona is the
property of the Government and may be
retained by you as long as needed.
13th ir.st, and arrived in the vicinity of
Gibara on the 16th. Before entering the
port she hoisted a flag of truce. The
t T nited States g-unboat Nashville, which
was in port, inquired if she carried docu
ments for the American ship. The Isa
bel answered in the negative, and sig
naled that the peace protocol had been
signed. The news was received aboard
the Nashville enthusiastically, the crew
cheering and shouting.
When the Isabel entered the port an
American officer boarded her and inform
ed her that the town was in the hands
of General Calixto Garcia.
It is reported that General Garcia, after
entering Gibara, assaulted the custom
house administrator, slapping his face,
and afterward ordered a negro to beat
him with a machete. It is also said that
Garcia demanded money from the Gibara
merchants. The merchants refused to
comply with his demand, whereupon he
ordered that they should pay double the
amount of his first exaction. General
Garcia also ordered the arrest of over 1400
Spanish residents, who were liberated af
ter the arrival of the Infanta Isabel.
It is reported that General Garcia re
signed on the 19th inst.. and that his com
mand was taken over by the leader, Luis
Feria. Nothing is known, however, in
official circles, regarding the report that
Garcia had resigned and that his resigna
tion had been accepted by the insurgent
government.
FILIPINOS BRAVER
THAN THE SPANIARDS
Fight Like Demons as Long as the
Tide of Battle is Not Against
Them.
BY SOL N. SHERIDAN.
CAVITE ARSENAL, July 13.â My
opinion of the insurgents, as sol
diers, has changed, as I have seen
more and more of their undoubted
bravery, and of the wonderful tenacity
of purpose, the relentless ferocity with
which they have followed the Span
iards step by step, in the long struggle
whose result is now Â§een to be inevit
able. The Filipino, somewhere away
back in his ancestry, has the drop of
black blood which makes him cower
and shrink when a bullet hits him. It
Is the display of what sporting men
call the "streak of yellow."
But so long as he is a winner, and
even for a longer lime than is the case
with most dark races after he has be
gun to lose, the Filipino will fight like
a demon, and he Is so immeasurably
the superior of the Spaniard in fighting
ability, his "streak of yellow" lies so
much further below the surface than
the Don's, that the odds are in his fa
vor anyway. That he has made a good
fight goes without saying. The result
is his Justification, and although I do
not believe he would ever have
achieved anything without the aid of
Dewey's guns and the more powerful
American dollar, he has In the past,
and * would in the future, had
Spain's claim been put off, have given
the Castilians not a little trouble in the
matter of the collection of revenues.
That, you know, has been always
Spain's whole purpose in the planting
and holding of colonies, to make them
pay as much money to b- sent to the
mother country as possible, regardless
of their own welfare, and that fact con
tains the story of the downfall of the
Spanish empire.
To return to my friend, the Filipino.
He is, just now, most enthusiastically
in love with the Americano. Out in the
country there is nothing too good for
the American. I know, for I have cov
ered a considerable portion of the inte
rior during the three weeks we have
been here. I have lived with the native
in his hut and I have had the best the
hut contained put freely at my disposi
tion, the best to eat, the best split bam
boo floor, soft and springy, to sleep
upon, even the best of his weapons, the
pride of his heart, his loved machete,
keen enough to shave with and heavy
enough to cleave a man's skull at a
blow, offered to me as a free gift. And
yet there has been always, in my mind
a lurking distrust of my host. There is
something of a glint â a suggestion of
the Malay drop in his mixed ancestry â
in the soft brown eye, recalling to my
mind those old stories of dark men
running amuck to kill and kill and kill,
until they have themselves been shot in
their tracks like dogs as they deserved.
I have recalled, fighting the mosqui
toes, through the night, the fact that
no wise sea captain will ship a Manila
man as one of his crew, and that na
tive Filipinos have been taken, as
children, into Spanish families and ten
derly reared only, at the last, to put
poison In the food of the entire family,
and to make no excuse for the atro
cious act other than to say they had
grown "hot in the head." And their
way of cutting their black hair short
all around with a kind of roach on the
top is suggestive grimly of a subjective
desire to breed this "heat." Whether
a people bo characterized can ever be
trusted to govern themselves â and the
Filipinos clearly expect the Americans
to trust them after Manila shall have
been taken â is a question for statesmen
â but I would most respectfully sug
gest to the statesmen, before attempt
ing Its' solution, that they come out
here and take a few practical lessons in
ethnology.

MOUNTAIN 'FIRE
AGAIN RAMPANT
Breaks Out With Increased
Fury on the San Gabriel
Reseryation.
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 23.â The flre
In the San Gabriel mountains is
burning with increased fury to-day
and it is feared that the fire fight
ers will be unable to control the
spread of the flames, the work be
ing carried on under the greatest
difficulties. At present the flames
are sweeping every piece of timber
along both forks of the Tejunga,
and fierce flames are raging in the
Chilleo canyon, which the men have
been unable to check. The flre has
reached to within three-quarters of
a mile of Switzer's Camp. It
threatened to enter Bear Canyon,
but was finally, after a hard figh^fc,
got under control. Fifty men start
ed for Tejunga to-day from Mount
Wilson, where they had succeeded
in stoppiny the further progress of
the flames in that direction. Much
depends on the wind as to whether
the Tejunga fire can be got under
control. The latest reports from
that point do not tend to allay the
apprehension felt for the safety of
the reserves.
PYTHIAN KNIGHTS
AT INDIANAPOLIS
Biennial Session of the
Supreme Lodge.
THOUSANDS IN THE PARADE
MONSTER PROCESSION THREADS
THE CITY'S STREETS.
In Executive Session an Investiga
tion of Recent Disclosures to
the American Press Is
Ordered.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
INDIANAPOLIS Ind., Aug. 23.â The
Supreme Lodge, Knights of Pythias,
began its biennial session in the hall
of the House of Representatives at the
State Capitol this morning. Caleb S.
Denny, ex-Mayor of Indianapolis,
chairman of the citizens' executive
committee, called the meeting to order.
Mayor Taggart and Governor James
A. Mount welcomed the lodge, and on
behalf of the Grand Lodge of Indiana
Grand Chancellor Union B. Hunt made
an address of welcome. Supreme Chan
cellor Colgrove replied in a speech of
about ten minutes. At 11 o'clock the
Supreme Lodge settled down to busi
ness, after the galleries had been
cleared.
The Supreme Lodge Is in poor finan
cial condition, having less than $10,000
on hand. This fact caused some of the
members to severely criticize the pres
ent supreme officers, and some of the
charges found their way into the pub
lic press, causing a great sensation.
The Supreme Lodge late this afternoon
appointed an investigating committee
to ascertain who furnished the charges
to the papers, and it is the intention to
expel the offending member, not only
from the Supreme Lodge, but from the
order, and there is talk <jf suits against
the papers which published the
charges. The condition of affairs has
caused a determination on the part of
the Supreme Lodge to change the man
ner of raising revenues. It is the in
tention to have passed, at the begin
ning of each Supreme Lodge meeting,
an appropriation bill similar to the
bills passed by Congress and the State
Legislatures, and to raise this money a
tax will be levied on each member of
the order. There Is considerable oppo
sition to this plan and a hot fight is ex-
The officers of the Supreme Lodge will
be elected on Thursday morning. A
hard fight is being made against the
incumbents, but it is thought they will
be re-elected, except that Charles E.
Shipley of Richmond, Ind., is leading
Â£or the position of vice chancellor.
There are about 45,000 strangers In the
city, of whom 15,000 are in uniform.
More than 8000 members of subordinate
lodges are in attendance. The Pythian
parade this afternoon was witnessed by
75 000 people. About 13,000 members of
the Uniform Rank and 6000 members
of the subordinate lodges participated.
The parade was reviewed by the su
preme and grand officers and the offi
cers of the State and city. It was the
largest secret society para.d.Â£ ever held
in this city. ~
There is a strong fight Detween Louis
ville and Detroit for the next session
of the Supreme Lodge. Delegates from
both places have opened Headquarters
and are making things t-exceedinglyt -exceedingly
lively. v
The annual reports of the supreme
officers were read this afternoon, after
which the lodge adjourned to witness
the parade. The report of Mr. R. L. C.
White, supreme keeper of records and
seal, was in part as follows:
The total number of subordinate lodges
December 31, 1897, was C 683. and the total
number of members 465.269â a net gain
during the calendar year of 46 lodges,
and a net loss of 1022 members; and a net
gain during the years 1596 and 1897 of 179
lodges and 3730 members. We sustained
a net loss of membership during the
past yearâ the first since 1878. But when
we take into consideration the depressed
financial condition of the country, we
should congratulate ourselves that the
loss was not larger. We have done as
well as any of the fraternal organiza
tions and better than most of them.

LONDON, Aug. 23.â The Associated Press learns that the Philip

nouncing that matters there were rapidly quieting down and that
the friction between Aguinaldo and the Americans was disappearing.
According to the Junta's advices the insurgents for a time re
garded General Merrltt and General Anderson as martinets and
feared they would adopt harsh methods, like the Spaniards, toward
the Filipinos, but the Insurgents from the first have had the great
est confidence In Admiral Dewey, whom they regard as a sort of
father and the most Important American at Manila.
The junta is satisfied that all friction will soon disappear and
there will be no trouble from the insurgents if the Americans decide
to retain the Philippines.
According to a wealthy Filipino now in London the Filipinos
In Europe are all well-to-do people. Hitherto they have held aloof
from the insurgents; but they now realize that their interests de
mand action and they are about to form a committee to open nogotia
tions with the junta here. They are all in favor of having the archi
pelago retained by the United States. So strong is their conviction
of the desirability of this course that they had contemplated ap
proaching the British Foreign Office to invite Great Britain to inter
vene and In any event to prevent the islands being returned to the
control of Spain. They desired, however, to await American action.
HOME WRECKED
WITH DYNAMITE
Italian Family's Lucky
Escape at Fresno.
BOMB THROWN ON THE ROOF
SHATTERS THE BUILDING BUT
INJURES NO ONE.
The Occupants Scared Out of Their
Witsâ Dastardly Deed Done at
Night, and Fire Is Nar
rowly Averted.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, Aug. 23.â An attempt was
made to-night to blow A. G. Laveroni
and family to atoms, a dynamite bomb
hnving been thrown on top of the house,
which tore a hole in the roof and played
havoc In the room directly below. Mrs.
Laveroni was in the house at the time,
and also an Italian. Laveroni himself
was not seen after the explosion, and It
is believed that he was not at home.
The scared occupants ran Into the
street, and the greatest excitement pre
vailed in the neighborhood. Mrs. Laver
oni was frightened into hysterics, and
the Italian who was in the house was
also badly scared. He ran all the way
to Chinatown in his stocking feet to
spread the alarm.
The bomb or stick of giant powder shat
tered the rafters of the roof, tearing a
ragged hole in it and then wrecked the
contents of the room just below/ which
was used as a store-room. When the of
ficers entered the house they saw some
clothing just taking fire, which they
quickly put out.
Laveroni has made a number of bitter
enemies of late and the officers believe
that the dastardly deed of last night was
a result of their hatred. Laveroni re
cently had trouble with E. Desperati and
both men were placed under bonds of $250
to keep the peace.

MADRID, Aug. 23.â There Is a growing
feeling of indignation here which has been
discussed fully in ministerial circles, at
the failure of the insurgents to respect the
protocol and order for a cessation of hos
tilities. To-day an Important political per
sonage said, speaking of the situation:
"If matters are continued thus Spain
will find herself compelled to stop the re
patriation of Cuban troops unles.s the
United States could give a guarantee that
Spanish interest would be safeguarded
from the piratical inclination of the in-
The matter is at such a point that if
the insurgents continue hostilities the
Government, according to a most Impor
tant ministerialist, will give orders that
Spanish troops take the offensive against
those insurgents who do not respect the
protocol.
NEW YORK. Aug. 23.â 1n an interview
to-day H. S. Rubens, counsel for the Cu
ban delegation, said that it was possible
small bands of Cubans were still fighting
in the interior of Cuba. There are no tele
phone or telegraph wires running over
the Island and it is thought it was possi
ble some bands were not aware of the ces
sation of hostilities. He was sure, how
ever, that whenever news of the protocol
had been carried to the Cubans they
would cease fighting.

digging coal. The great distance under the hills makes it impossibla
for me to get pure air, which is forced to us by the aid of great fans. .
During breaks in "machinery the air would become bad, causing first
great pains in. my â  head, dizziness and fainting. This continued until j
next was pains in; stomach, indigestion and dyspepsia. Working hard i
in the mines I naturally was a hearty eater until at last I had dyspep-
' -\ sia so bad I suffered terrible. The doctor prescribed for me, but I
only got worse. Iâ ' took several of medicine. I saw . Ripans "

SAVE DOCTOR BILLS,
Better Than Blood Purifiers
- â  â â  Â»
and Nerve Tonics
#
Is the New Remedy for Dyspep=
sia and Indigestion.
Better, Because Perfect Di-
gestion Makes Pure Blood
and Strong Nerves.
Some Interesting Facts Concern-
ing This Remarkable
Remedy.
NOT A SECRET PATENT MEDICINE
Whether we eat to live or live to eat. It
1b certain that the possession of a healthy
stomach and sound digestion go a long
way toward making life desirable, suc-
cessful, enjoyable. Beauty In woman,
strength, mental capacity, endurance In
man, depend more upon vigorous digestion
than upon any other one thing.
The dyspeptic man Is irritable, uncer-
tain, fearful of the future. The dyspep-
tic woman is nervous, sallow, subject to
headaches and despondency.
And what Is the cause of these com-
mon types of men and women? Simply,
undigested food, nothing more nor leas.
The appetite being capricious, not enough
food is eaten, nnd what is eaten, instead
of being properly digested, remains in the
etomach for hours, a sour, fermenting
mass, poisoning the blood, a sourca of ir-
ritation to every nerve and organ. No
wonder people suffer from poor blood,
shattered nerves, headaches, palpltatinH
hearts, irritable tempers and gloomy, dis-
contented feeling?.
Now, what is the rational cure for this
common condition? Is it "blood puri-
fiers" and "nerve tonics"? By no means,
bocause they don't reach the seat of the
trouble. Go to the fountain head, tho
etomach, get that in good healthy work-
Ing order, and pure blood, strong nerves,
bright eyes, clear color will be the nat-
ural result-
Why not? "Where does blood, nerve,
bone, sinew and flesh come from anyway,
If not from the stomach, the food we eat
and digest.
To cure digestion, the one thing neces-
sary 1b to give the stomach a rest or par-
tial rest by the daily use for a time of
some remedy which will digest food.
There is a very excellent preparation of
this kind, not a marvelous secret patent
medicine, but a pleasant, harmless com-
bination of vegetable essences, fruit salta,
pure pepsin and Golden Seal, sold by
druggists under the name of Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets, and nothing to equal it
has yet been produced In the whole cate-
gory of patent medicines.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets Is superior
to them all, because when these tablets
are used you know what you are taking
into your stomach. No secret is made or
their composition and physicians and
chemists know that one grain of the di-
gestive principle in Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets will digest 8000 times its own
â wpiprht of wholesome food. Dr. Jennlson
recommends them highly, not only as a
cure for digestion, but also because they
Increase flesh by Increasing nutrition.
â¢ Dr. Harlandson Bays to increase flesh,
appetite and to secure healthy digestion
I have found nothing so safe, so effectual
as Stnart's Dyspepsia Tablets. Mr. JatÂ».
Benton of Rosston says: "I suffered fiva
years with nervou6 dyspepsia and catarrh
of the 3tomach. Everything I ate seemed
to sour on my stomach; could not enjoy
a meal for fear of the distress afterward.
My druggist advised Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets and I can now eat anything I
â want, have gained In flesh and good spir-
its and I know the tablets did it and I
shall always keep them within reach."
One of the most remarkable cures ever
made by these tablets was In the case or
Mrs. Sarah Skeels of Lynnville, lowa,
who had chronic dyspepsia for twenty-five
years and doctors pronounced her case
Incurable, yet she enthusiastically writes
that the tablets completely and perma-
nently cured her.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets save doctors'
bill, because a full-sized package costing
50 cents at any drug store will often do
more good for a weak stomach than fifty
dollars' worth of ordinary doctor's fees.

Commander Z. L. Tanner of the United
States navy is a gentleman much In de
mand just now. He rarely emerges from
the seclusion of his bedroom at the Oc
cidental, for a dozen hungry contractors
are sure to be at his heels, clamoring for
plans and specifications. They all want a
slice of the Pago Pago pudding, and, as
Commander Tanner says, there is not
enough to go round.
The whole trouble arises from the fact
that the Naval Department has decided to
deal with the Pago Pago coaling station
on a purely war basis. The contract for
a wharf and coaling sheds at this Sa
moan island is not to be let on the ordi
nary commercial lines. Tenders will not
be called for, nor will the specifications
be advertised. Commander Tanner has
absolute authority to give the worK to
any one he chooses to select.

A PROMINENT SAN FRANCISCAN,
Honored by High Official Position, Strongly In=
dorses a Well=Xnown Preparation.
â  . â  â 
All Californians know and admire the Hon. John T. Dare,
now United States Appraiser of this port. His experiences have
been varied, and he has been the recipient of many honors.
He came around the Horn in 1801 as officer of a ship, and, going
to Arizona, became noted on the frontier as a pony express rider,
afterward serving as a member of the Territorial Legislature.
Returning to San Francisco, he was admitted to the bar in 1874.
Later he visited Honolulu, became a member of the King's
Cabinet, and was appointed by King Kalakaua Attorney-
General of the Island Kingdom.
Two years later he returned to San Francisco, resumed the
practice of law, and acted as fiduciary agent for large con-
tractors engaged in railroad building.
In 1877 he represented Solano County in tho Legislature.
He served a term in the District Attorney's office, and his splen-
did record as Prosecuting Attorney is conceded to be one of tho
best and most successful in the history of the office
Mr. Dare is a man of action, resolute and fertile in re-
sources. He has rendered valuable service to the Republican
party on the stump, and is widely known as a practical news-
paper writer.
The fact that Mr. Dare has been willing to make public the
great benefit derived from the use of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
is a strong argument in favor of that widely advertised prepara-
tion. Here is what he has to say :
San Francisco, June 20, '98.
F. A Stuart Co., Marshall, Mich.
Dear Sirs â In view of the fact that I have been for
years a great sufferer from Dyspepsia and kindred stomach
troubles, I think it only a matter of justice to make public the
remarkable effect of your well-known remedy, Stuart's Dyspep-
sia Tablets, for the cure of such maladies. While one year ago
it was practically an impossibility for me to eat anything but
select foods, I am happy to state that after three months' use of
the Tablets I find no difficulty in eating the heartiest meals of
any kind of food desired without disagreeable after effects.
You are at liberty to use my name in the exploitation of
your remedies, as I consider it is your due that those who are
benefited should make public the benefit so derived.
Yours very truly, JOHN T. DAftE,
Appraiser of the Port of San Francisco.
FACTS WITH POINTS.
Every One of These Statements Ab-
solutely True.
Mr. A. W, Sharper, 61 Prospect streÂ«t,
Indianapolis, Ind., says: "Gratitude
ant Chambers of the Civil i^nginertng
Department of the navy will go to Tu
tuila to supervise the work. My business
is to fix the contract."
Commanuer Tanner is not without Sa
moan experience. In 1872 he was in Pago
Pago harbor as navigating lieutenant of
the Narragansett, anu it was then that he
made the trial surveys which led to the
establishment of a coaling station for the
United States navy in this harbor. Also
the commander has a fine war record. He

for Stuart's Tablets. _
Mrs. Sarah A. Skeels. Lynnvllle. lowa.
"It has been six months since I tooK
Stuart's. Dyspepsia Tablets and am fully
cured. Have not had a particle of distress
or difficulty since. This Is in the face or
the fact that I had suffered from stom-
ach trouble for twenty-five years and was
pronounced incurable by the doctors
James Newmestes, Eau Claire. \\ is ,
says: "Two 50-cent packages of Stuarts
Dyspepsia Tablets did me more good than
any remedy I had ever before tried. They
hit the spot with me. and I once more
have an appetite and can eat what I
please without fear of distress and bloat-
ing afterward."
Dr. Harlandson relates the case of Miss
Helen Sholes of Nashville, who was cured
of dyspepsia and gained IS pounds In
weight after suffering from stomach trou-
ble for eight years. The doctor use* them
in ail stomach troubles because they are
not a secret patent medicine, but contain
pure pepsin, Diastase, fruit acids and val-
uable digestives, which digest the food
whether the stomach works or not, gives
it the needed rest, and a cure is the nat-
ural result.
Dr. Jennison says nine-tenths of disease
is caused by indigestion and Stuart's Dys-
Cepsia Tablets Is the safest and best cure,
ecause they are not a secret patent med-
icine, but contain the valuable digestive
principles needed by every weak stomach,
and a whole box would not hurt a child,
being absolutely harmless.

A GOOD COMPLEXION
Depends on Good Digestion.
This is almost an axiom, although us-
ually we are apt to think that cosmetics,
face powders, lotions, fancy soaps, etc.,
are the secret for securing a clear com-
plexion.
But all these are simply superficial as-
sistants. It Is imposible to have a good
complexion unless the digestive organs
perform their work properly, unless the
stomach by properly digesting the food
taken Into It furnishes an abundance of
pure blood a good complexion is impos-
sible.
Tills is the reason so many ladles are
using Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, because
they promptly cure any stomach trouble,
and they have found out that perfect
digestion means a perfect complexion and
one that does not . require cosmetics and
powders to I enhance' its beauty.
Many ladies diet themselves or deny
themselves many articles of food solely
In order to keep their complexions clear.
When Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are
used no such dieting is necessary. Take
these tablets and eat all the good, whole-
some food you want, and you need have
no fear of Indigestion, nor the sallow, dull
complexion which nine women out of ten
have, solely because they are suffering
from some form of indigestion.
Bear In mind that beauty proceed? from
good health, good health results from per-
fect digestion, and we have advanced the
best argument to Induce every man - or
woman to give this splendid remedy a
trial.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets can be found
In drugstores, and costs but -.50 cents per
package. They are prepared by the
Stuart Chemical Co., Marshall. Mich.
If there Is any derangement of the
stomach or bowels they will remove It.
and the resultant effects are good diges-
tion, good health and a clear, bright com-
plexion. Ask your druggist for the tab-
lets and a free book on stomach diseases.

INTERESTING EXPERIENCE
Of an lowa Lady Who Was Cured of
Dyspepsia After Suffering for
Twenty-Five Years.
Mrs. Sarah A. Skeels, an estimable lady
residing at Lynnvllle, Jasper County,
lowa, was for twenty-five years a sufferer
from Dyspepsia, and her complete restor-
ation to health Is so remarkable' that we
present the facts In the case for the bene-
fit of our readers, many of whom have
doubtless suffered in the same manner
and will, therefore, be Interested In learn-
ing how all stomach troubles may be
avoided and cured. Mrs. Skeels says: I
used only one package of Stuart's DyÃ-
pepsla Tablets and I received such great
and unexpected benefit that I wish to ex-
press my sincere gratitude. In fact, It has
been six months since I took the medi-
cine and I have not had one particle of
distress or difficulty since. And all this in
the face of the fact that the best doctors
I consulted told me my case was Incur-
able, as I had Buffered for twenty-five
years. I want half a dozen packages to
distribute among my friends here who are
very anxious to try this remedy. Yours
truly. MRS. SARAH A. SKEELS
The reason why Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets are so successful In curing Indi-
gestion and stomach troubles and the rea-
son why it never disappoints those who
need it and use It Is because nothing Is
churned for it except what it will actu-
ally perform. It is not a cure-all, and no
such claims are made for It. It Is pre-
pared for the Role purpose of curing
Dyspepsia and .the various forms of Indi-
gestion.
There is scarcely a patent medicine
made but what is claimed to cure dyspep-
sia as well as a hundred other troubles.
When, as a matter of fact, a remedy to
cure Dyspepsia must be prepared especi-
ally for that and nothing else: and among
all the remedies, patent nostrums, bitters,
etc., so extensively advertised you will
find that Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets Is
the only one advertised as a cure for dys-
pepsia and nothing else. The remedy Is
prepared by the Stuart Co. of Marshall.
Mich., and for sale by all druggists at f>o
cents per package, and if you suffer from
any form of stomach derangement or
indigestion, a trial will not disappoint
you.

fying Pago Pago harbor. The United
States has no right to do that in any
case. All that we propose to do is to pro
vide coaling facilities for our shipsâ to
erect a wharf and coaling sheds.
"The wharf will run out over the reef
Into deep water for a distance of about
250 feet. This will give plenty ol water
alongside the dock, fifteen fathoms or
so, and there will be no difficulty in coal
ing. On shore we propose to have steel
sheds for the coal, with a tramway and
all other suitable appliances."
The commander declines to say any
thing about the cost of the work. That
depends upon the contractors, and until
bids are received he cannot give an esti-
mate.
'"The papers are coming from Washing
ton," is all he will say.
Meanwhile there are a dozen or more
firms here clamoring for this very juicy
contract, which may run up to a couple
of hundred thousand dollars or so. And
they want to know why tenders have not
been called for and specifications adver
tised. In the usual course.
"It Is a war measure," says Commander
Tanner. But, then, the war Is over and
there is no particular necessity for haste
with regard to Pago Pago. Uncle Sam
has neglected the place for a dozen
years or so and a month. It is thought,
might well be spared now.

Heacock considered that another change

that he be held for deportation on the

The Soldiers on the Three Transports
for the 1- resent Will Not dto
Beyond Honolulu, There
to Await Orders.
According to a dispatch from Washing
ton General Merritt has cabled the War
Department that he needs no more
troops. The soldiers that have been or
dered to Honolulu, there to await fur
ther Instructions, are therefore not likely
to get any further than that port. How
long they are to remain there Is now a
question. It would not be surprising,
under the circumstances. If orders were
received from Washington countermand-
Ing the sending to Honolulu of any more
troops, with the exception of the rem
nant of the New York regiment, consist-
Ing of two companies and a half. How
ever, unless such orders are racei%'ed. the
Scandla, the Australia and the City of
Sydney will all sail on Saturday with
troops for Honolulu, to be followed next
week by the City of Peking. The Aus
tralia and the City of Sydney will carry
the Seventh California. Both the Ari
zona and the Scandla, after unloading
their troops at Honolulu, may proceed to
Manila. This is inferred from a Wash
ington dispatch which says that General
Merritt has been cabled that the Scandla
has been furnished as a hospital ship,
and that the Arizona, being the prop
erty of the Government, may be retained
by him us long as needed. To the Scan
dia there have been assigned 120 men of
the Hospital Corps for Manila. This
adds confirmation to the belief that this
steamer will go through to Manila. Fur
thermore, $1,000,000, mostly In gold and

Manila, was put aboard the Scandia yes
terday. Tins money was In charge of

BIGGY'S FORCE OF
EMPLOYES REDUCED
BY DIRECTION OF THE ELEC
TION COMMISSIONERS.
Experienced Men Are Displaced to
Make Room for Fifteen New
Appointees.
The Board of ElectloiÂ» Commissioners
met again yesterday morning to linlsh up
their case ftgafnst Registrar Biggy. In
accordunce with the programme previous
ly announced. Auditor Broderlck moved
that the force in Mr. Biggy's office, be cut
down twenty men and that the Registrar
be instructed to make the necessary dis
missals. Broderick figured that with the
fifteen new men appointed by the board
on the preceding day B4ggy would have
enough men left to handle the work of
purging the registration lists.
Mr. Gallagher, who had Juat taken his
seat as the successor of City and County
Attorney Creawell, moved to amend by
dropping only fifteen of Biggy's old men.
He did not want to cripple the Registrar's
office. He thought that forty-seven men
wore needed to purge the register.
Mayor Fhelan objected to any dismiss
als. He stated that he had absolute con
fidence in Mr. Blggy, and that as the lat
ter declared that ne needed sixty-two men
(the present number) he was in favor 01
retaining all of the force, including, of
course, the new appointees.
The Registrar made a short speech,
stating that he had use for all of the men
In his office. The majority of the board,
however, had made an Issue with Mr
Biggy. and was determined to carry out
the prearranged plan. This was done
only the Mayor and Block voting in the
negative. As a result of the passage of
the resolution, Biggy found himself con
fronted with the unpleasant necessity of
discharging fifteen of his experienced
men. against whom no charg-es had been
brought and who were simply thrown out
to give place to fifteen new men whom he
did not know and did not want.
The fifteen new appointees of the board
presented themselves to Mr. Blggy yostor
day morning and were put to work pre
paring registration lists for purging. The
Registrar decided to make no further pro
test. Within a few days all of the office
force will be put to work canvassing the
city.
D. C. VANIFR IS

' 4into|an' ASYLUM.
He Is ;-~; -~ Now ;; Persecuting His Two
: Elder 'fihildren . and Warrants
>;V; Are for His Arrest.
Warrants were sworn out yesterday in
Judge Joachimsens court for the arrest
of D. C. Vanler on charges of vagrancy,
disturbing the peace and threats against
life.
Vanier first came to the notice of the
police about two years ago, when he was
arrested for cruelty to his children. He
secured a trial by jury and was acquitted,
although the evidence of his cruelty to
one of the boys was very convincing. A
year later he was arrested on a similar
charge, and was convicted by Judge Low
and sentenced to six months In the
County Jail.
During his incarceration his wife pro
cured a divorce from him. The eldest girl
found a home with a family on Octavia
street and the eldest boy got employment
In the White House. The younger chil
dren were sent to the Mount St. Joseph
Orphan Asylum. After Vanier's release
he discovered where his wife was living
and from one of the younger boys learned
where the girl was and where the boy was
employed.
He went to his wife's house about two
months ago and so scared her by threat
ening to kill her with a razor unless sho
consented to live with him again that she
lost her reason and Is now in an asylum.
Since then he has been going to the White
House and annoying the boy George by
following him around and making threats
against nlm and also visiting the house
where the girl lives and raising a disturb
ance. The boy complained to the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children,
and yesterday morning Officer McMurray
swore to the complaints" before Judge
Joachlmsen.
It is probable that Vanler may have to
be taken before the Insanity Commission
ers.

ELIZABETH COOK'S ESTATE.
W. G. Tripp Will Have to Deliver It
Over to the Administrator.
The Supreme Court has decided that
the property belonging to thr estate of
Elizabeth L. Cook, deceased, of Alameda,
must be handed over to Administrat r
Knight. The case has some peculiar fea
tures. In the early part of 1895 Mrs.
Cook, who was well along in years, found
that it would be necessary to und< â¢
surgical operation, with the hope of sav
ing her life. She called in her fri< â¢ i
named W. G. Tripp, to whom
all of her property in trust, in case the
operation should not be a success. The
transfer, if such it could be called, was
in the form of a bill of sale, but she
directed that he dispose of the property
according: to her wishes, and he kept a
memorandum of the disposition to b<Â»
made of the estate. The woman died a
few days after the operation, an I Tripp
was called upon to deliver the property
to the administrator.
This he refused to do, setting up that
the property was given to him to be dis
posed of according to the wishes of the
deceased. The lower court decided In
favor of the administrator, but a little.
later it granted a motion for a new trial
of this case. From this Knight took an
appeal to the Supreme Court, and that
tribunal decided that no new trial should
be had. The Justices took the position
that the woman had no intention to make
Tripp- a present of the estate, and the bill
of sale did not count.

but then- it was one horse against two.
The Madden stringâ Glenheim, Rhine
lander and Scannellâ was next in fa
voritism and down in the ring, where
It was like a furnace, the men tumbled
over each other in their eagerness to
put up their money on their choice.
â¢ . The parade to the post began at five
.minutes past four and the twenty-three
youngsters, cantered up the track.
Then began the delay. Several times
â¢ the starter descended to the track and
gave the boys a talking to, but to no
.use. It was 5:37 when the twentieth
and last break came, exactly one hour
and thirty-two minutes after they
preached the post, and for so many
{ "youngsters it was really a good start.
â 'They were practically in line, the only
/one ou. of it being Duke of Middleburg,
,â¢ who was to all intents and purposes
â â¢ : . : left at the post.

Rusher, Sir Hubert, His Lordship,
â "= Scannel and Martimas, the others be
. ing. close enough up to have a chance.
. â Maher. the quick-witted lightweight,
â¢ dug his heels into High Degree and set
sail for the pole. In a few strides the
'filly had her nose in front of Rusher.
Inch by inch at first, then foot by foot,
â¢ and the short first furlong had been
' covered with High Degree a half length
â¢'. in- front of Rusher; he a couple of
: lengths in front of Autumn, on whom
. :Taral was struggling hard in the deep
. : golng on the outside of the chute.
â  Prestidigltatrice was only a neck be
hind, with Scannell, Martimas, His
Lordship and Sir Hubert following and
all the others well up. It was anybody's
race then.
. ", The chute was narrowing now and all
were seeking a good place in which to
â  round the bend into the main track.
' Maher wanted the hard going at the
1 rail, but Rusher clung to High Degree
like' a leech and would not be shaken
off Two furlongs had been covered and
High Degree was still a half-length in
front of Rusher, who was then only a
neck in front of the favorite, Autumn,
who was a nose in front of Sir Hubert,
he in turn a neck in front of the Cana
dian. Martimas. Prestidigitatrice was
falling out of it and Armament was
getting prominent.
â¢ Now came a^iustlc, for the turn was
at hand. All the boys were working
like demons to get to the front. Rusher
stopped as if he had been shot and then
how Maher did ride! Crouching low on
High Degree's neck he drove her with
hands and heels and when there was
* but a quarter of a mile to go he was a
length and a half in front; but he did
Dot dare to swing over against the rail
now. as he was far out on the track.
Lewis, however, had gradually worked
to the rail and as they turne '. Into the
homestretch he was in the coveted hard
ground. . -
And how Martimas was flying! He
was already in second place at the
quarter, two lengths In front of Rusher,
who was a length in front of Mr. Clay,
who was in a bunch with Dr. Eichberg,
Sir Hubert and His Lordship.- Now the
last furlong pole was reached and little
Maher saw Martimas rush by on the
firm, hard footing' against the rail,
while the tired filly under him waa
stopping in the deep dust and Autumn,
Mr. Clay and Dr. Eichberg. with Sloan
on the latter, finishing in his best style,
were trying to wrest the . second place
away from him. For an instant Au
tumn had his nose in front of the filly,
and then stopped as if he had been shot
and finished away back.
Then Maher worked harder than ever,
â¢ and although, he could not catch the
Canadian in front, who won easily by
a couple of lengths, he could and did
get the second money by a half-length.
, here was a pretty struggle for third
place between Williams on Mr. Clay
and * Sloan on Dr. Eichberg and - the
. former got it by a head. The remainder
of the bunch were so close together at
the end of the race that it was impos
sible to separate the horses. .

MARTIMAS, THE WINNER.
His Breeding and Becord â Some Fu
turity History.
Martlmas Is a chestnut colt owned by
W. JVI. Hendrie of Canada, though the
Futurity winner is a Kentucky product.
Martlmas' breeding is of the best, and
on that breeding it would be strange if
he were not a high class racer. His
sire, imp. Candlemas (brother to imp.
St. Blaise, winner of the Derby at Ep
som), won the Epsom grand prize Royal
stakes and Autumn handicap at Sandown
Park, the Zetland Biennial at Newmark
et and Chesterfield cup at Goodwood. He
is the sire of Dr. Catlett, Swiftmaa, Dr.
Eichberg and a host of good perfo.mera
Blggonet, dam by Martimas, won the
classic Withers stakes and many other
important races, and was reckoned one
of the best race mares in the country
in the late eighties. Her mother was
I the dam of five good winners, and the
family on the female side Is the one
from which come Tyrant, Gamma, Mollie
> McCarty, Kinglike, Hidalgo, Fltz James,
' Mimi. and all the members of the cele
! brated Hennle Farrow tribe. Following
! If the extended pedigree of the colt that
; yesterday won with such remarkable ease
: the richest of two-year-old stakes In all
! the world:
The record of Martimas was so pood .
that the 30 to 1 offered against his chances
looked very much out of place. It was:
Four starts,, three wins and. a second
(latter to Kentucky Colonel In the Grand
Union stakes at Saratoga). His wins were
at the big Canadian .meeting, ana in
Btfl.lCÂ£S tOO.
t The second animal at the finish in
the Futurity (High Degree) was by a
Futurity .winner, His Highness, from
Nettie, % Neptune. â ;...<?> w â¢"â  ;
Mr Clay, third In the great stake, was
bred' at Rancho del Paso, near Sacra
mento. CaL, and is by imp. nari>Wii from
Miss Clay (dam of Candor, Hoodlum and
Black Hawk), by Hindoo; seconu tiam
Belle of - Runnymede (sister to Miss
Woodford). by imp. Billet, etc.
Not only did a California bred colt
run third, but a Californian. the multi

winner of 1898" Futurity r
The field yesterday equaled in size the
one in ISS9. when twenty-three lined up.
Twenty-one faced the starter when His
Highness won it in 1891 and on t two oc
casions twenty competed for the rich
P While the best a California bred horse
ever did was to run second (Crescendo
had that honor in 1895, and S ilver 11.

WHITMAN KING
OF THE COURTS
Winner of the Tennis
Championship.
DEFEAT OF DWIGHT DAVIS
FAST PLAYS FBOM STABT TO
FINISH.
Brilliant Match Marked by the Re
markable Steadiness Displayed
by the Ultimate
Victor.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEWPORT, R. 1.. Aug. 23.â Malcomb
Whitman of Brookline, Mass., won the
national lawn tennis championship
here to-day by defeating Dwight Da
vis of St. Louis In a brlliant match, in
which the victor displayed remarkable
j steadiness, while his opponent's play
! weakened after the first set. Thousands
witnessed the match.
Both players started In at a very fast
clip, Whitman having a little the bet
j ter of it at the first, taking the first
| three games and allowing his opponent
i only four points. Dp- - took the next
three, however, leaving bis opponent at
thirty in each. He also took the sev
enth, after deuce had been called twice,
\ and the eighth, a love game. Deuce was
called in the ninth, but Davis took it
' and the set, 6â3. He had taken six
j straight by wonderfully fast work.
The second set started out as fast as
the first. Whitman played better and
Davis not as accurately as before.
Davis took the first, a love game,
Whitman the next at fifteen and Davis
the third at fifteen. This was the lat
tpr's last in the set, however, Whitman
taking five straight and the set, 6â2,6 â 2,
playing all around his opponent.
The third set began with Davis serv
ing. Whitman passed beautifully and
he took the game at fifteen. Davis took
the next at deuce, as did Whitman the
next.
The fourth, a love game, felt to Da
vis, whose driving and cross-court
shots were superb. Whitman took the
fifth at thirty, and the sixth, a deuce
game, giving him a lead of 4â2. In the
seventh Davis netted twice and Whit
man left him at twenty-five.
Whitman served well in the sixth and
got a lead of forty love. By difficult
play Davis made It deuce, but Whit
man won out the next two points and
the set, 4â2.4 â 2.
Whitman took the first game of the
fourth set after deuce had been called
twice, winning the last point on Davis'
double fault. The second game also
went to Whitman at fifteen, but Davis
took the next at love by a series of
beautiful smashes at the net. He was
very wild in the next two, however,
getting only two points.
The next was a deuce game, but
Whitman took it and needed a game
for the championship. Whitman took
the last game at fifteen and the set,
6âl.
Whitman improved steadily during
the match, whereas Davis never played
as well as he did in the first set. Sum
mary:
National lawn tennis championship,
finalsâ M. D. Whitman beat Dwight
Davis. Score: &â 6, 6â2, 6â 2, 6âl.

SELF-SACRIFICE
Perishes While Saving

BY THE FLAMES.
Heroism of a Tuolumne Miner's
Wife, Who in Throes of Death
Thinks Only of Her
Offspring.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, Aug. 23.â The story of a
woman's terrible death by fire and the
probably fatal burning of her six
months-old babe was brought to this
city to-day by the Rev. F. A. Morrow,
pastor of the Methodist Church at
Farmington, where the funeral of the
unfortunate wife and mother took place
yesterday.
The victim of the flames was Mrs. C.
E. Malkemaus, the young wife of a
man employed in the mines of Tuoium
ne County. With her three children,
ranging in age from six months to five
or six years, she resided in a cottage
three miles from the town of Jackson
ville and about thirty miles east of
Farmington. Last Saturday evening at
about ~sk Mrs. Malkemaus prepared
to wash the children and set a lamp
near a tub of water in the house. She
stepped out >^oors for a minute and on
returning found that the little ones had
overturned the lamp, from which the
blazing oil had spread over the floor.
"With a scream of terror the young
mother seiz-d one of the children and
ran with it to the open air. Dashing
back into the house she found that the
flames had caught in the clothing of
her baby and of the eldest child, a boy
of five or six years. She tried to ex
tinguish the blaze with a blanket, but
in spreading it over the children she
fanned the now fierce fire against her
own clothing, which blazed up in an in
stant, completely enveloping the poor
woman.
Though burning to death, she picked
up the baby, and, hugging it to her
breast, ran shrieking from the house.
In the meantime a. man who was at
work in the vicinity of the place has
tened to the cottage, attracted by the
screams. As he reached the woman
her clothing dropped from her body.
Her arms sank helpless to her side and
her little child, with clothing all ablaze,
fell to the ground. The mother's last
thought was for her offspring, and as
she sank down she cried out:
"Don't help me, but get my little
boy."
The fire within the dwelling was
making fast headway, but the rescuer
darted into the house and took the boy
out. The little fellow wao burned on
the left side of the face, the burns in
cluding his ear and nose.
Mrs. Malkemaus was literally roast
ed, the flesh being terribly burned over
almost her entire body, but life lin
gered until morning, when she died.
The babe was also frightfully burned,
most of the body being roasted by the
flames, and it is thought the injuries
will be fatal. The house was complete
ly destroyed and had it not been for
the last words Â«f the unfortunate
mother as she fell to tTie ground, where
ehe lay unconscious, the little boy
would have been burned to death in the
dwelling. Mrs. Malkemaua was only
21 years of age.
The remains were taken to Farming
ton, and a telegram was sent to Rev.
Mr. Morrow, who was at Pacific Grove,
asking him to return and hold the fu
neral services yesterday. The funeral
was one of the largest ever seen at that
place. _____________
INQTJIBY INTO INCENDIABISM.
Fails to Fix the Crime but Uncovers
a Romance.
STOCKTON. Augr. 23.â Mr. and Mrs.
Harry E. Hassel were examined by the
District Attorney yesterday in an attempt
to get at the facts concerning the cause
of the fire which broke out in their home
on Saturday night. The wife charges the
husband with being the incendiary, and
he makes counter-charges. An Investiga
tion of side facts shows that the woman,
who is young and handsome, has her
name in the Blue Book of England as a
Countess. Hassel is a "remittance man,"
and comes from a titled family. The
couple met on an ocean steamer, married
In haste, and are now repenting at leis
ure. They attempted to keep up style
here, but their purse was too slender, md
they fell out. The wife says he tried to
burn the house in revenge, while he says
she wants to throw the crime on his
shoulders to get rid of him. As cor
roborative evidence was lacking, no war
rant was Issued. General sympathy is
with the woman, and few believe that she
had anything to do with the starting of
the fire.

NEW YORK. Aug. 23.â There was nothing j
In the general, -situation either in the political j
or the business worM to account for a re- >
action In stocks to-day. The market was sim- j
ply overbought and was subject to a process of j
testing, which whether designed to do so or >
not. inevitably readjusts prices to the true I
basis of value. Yesterday's heavy profit-taking
on the part of some of the powerful Interests ;
who had been buying stocks in the confidence j
that they would advance In prices, led the way
naturally to to-day's demand. It became evi
dent at the opening that the strong support
(or the leaders had been withdrawn. In the ;
Grangers even the outside buying, which has j
bo eagerly absorbed these stocks for some time j
past, showed a marked diminution. There were i
even solHi.k orders in the commission houses I
for outside account, thus showing that a large <
part of the recent public Interest has been for j
speculative account. But the outside specu- |
lative public failed to show the aggressive con- j
fidence in their holdings recently manifested
by the powerful bull clique. Neither had they
the combined resources at their command to
come In and support stocks on the declining
market. The weakness of the hands into i
â which large amounts of the grangers had fallen |
â was made evident' by the ' heavy stop-loss or- i
ders which were uncovered by the decline of
from lVi<STl^Â«c In the grangers at midday. But
the torrent of offerings at the- low point fell to
interests that were waiting and willing and
â which effected a' substantial rally on compara
tively light transactions. The railroad list j
generally moved In sympathy with the gran- i
gers, the break In them putting an end for the !
time being to the strong upward movement
which had set in on â¢ some of the low priced |
Southern and Western railroad shares. The
early weakness was accentuated by the persist
ent sagging of Manhattan, which has fallen
about 3 points on the day. Brooklyn Transit
was also under severe pressure and Consoli
dated Gas and some of the other specialties
Buffered from withdrawal of support. The
early weakness of People's Gas and the j
subsequent strength probably reflected passing |
phases of efforts to adjust a business dispute. I
Metropolitan Street Railway rose at one time '
7 points without any news to account for the
movement. Rio Grande Western, Northwestern i
end a number of other stocks gave evidence of j
special strength . in the face of the general j
tendency of the market. The day's net de- j
clines were mostly small but the greater part of j
the day's business was done at prices material
ly lower than yesterday's closing. â¢
The disposition to take profits was also man- j
ifested in the bond market, where price i
changes were Irregular on a decreased volume
of business. Total sales, J3.415.000.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Aug. : 23.â Wheat started ; firm at
about yesterday's closing- figures, became easy
for a minute or bo and then became compara
tively strong and kept on the rise for over an
hour. At the end of that time September had
advanced to S2t&s2hi,c, as compared with 63c bid
the day before. December did follow September j
at that time to the extent of Vie, reaching
62* c. when September was 63* c and going no j
higher during the latter' further Vie Improve- i
ment. It was evident from that that the extra
strength in the nearer delivery proceeded from |
Blight misgivings as to the sufficiency of re
ceipts in the near future. Primary Western
market receipts amounted to 854,000 bushels,
against 873,00$ bushels the same day last year. !
Bradstreet'e reported the world's visible sup- j
ply to have decreased 3,498,090 bushels and Just :
previous to that announcement It became
known - that a large business had been done !
In Bpot wheat for prompt shipment. About
200,000 bushels No. 2 red was disposed of at
4c a bushel in store here above September
price. The cash business and Bradstreet'e to
gether caused an advance in September to 63% c, |
but December stuck when it (jot as high as 62c '
on the last bulge. December closed %c higher
at 63% c and December gained %c, closing at
62c.
Reports of deterioration In condition of the I
I crop from the extreme heat or the last two or
three days .strengthened corn. September left j
off *4c up. *
Oats ruled steady in sympathy with the other j
grains. September closed with a gain of He.
The strength in th* grain market kept scalp
era in provisions from the selling side, and
I there was no pressure from other quarters. j

WHY BOOTH ESCAPED.
The morning after the assassination of
President Lincoln the telegraph opera
tor of a ffmall town In Ohio read a pass
ing dispatch which conveyed the sorrow
ful information to him. This rapidly
spread through the surrounding coun
try, and at 11 o'clock, when the mall
train was due, nearly a hundred men
had congregated to buy a morning paper.
As a matter of course not a single pa
per remained, and all were in despair,
until some one remembered that the
postmaster was a regular subscriber, and
that the mall bap must contain a morn
ing newspaper addressed to him.
The coveted paper found, the opening
of the mall was postponed, while the
aged postmaster proceeded to read to
the people who had crowded into the
long store the details of the murder. In
the front rank of the little circle that
had, by innate courtesy, been left before
the reader, stood a very patriotic but
ignorant old man. who was ever making
pertinent suggestions.
The voice of the reader faltered more
than once as he read the account, now
so familiar to all Americans. Finally he
reached the point where It was said of
Booth that he "shrieked out 'Sic semper
tyrannls,' leaped on the stage and made
his escape."
Throwing his old poke hat on the floor
the patriotic old man lifted his hand
aloft and shouted:
"Good gracious! Why didn't somebody
have sense enopgh to stop the stage?"â

LORD ATHOL
IS CONVICTED
Passed a Bogus Check
on F. A. Wilder.
OUBRIDGE'S MANY ALIASES
EMBEZZLEMENT, FORGERY AND
LARCENY HIS FORTE.
â  . -
HÂ« Says His English Relatives
: â '.- Will Have to Dig Up or
Stand the Family.
: . . Disgrace.
â¢Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
â¢.':â¢'â  '.:. 908 Broadway, Aug. 23.
Henry Oiibridge, alias "Lord Cyrol
Athol.V whose notorious proneness to
do things inhibited by the Penal Code
â¢ and- whose many claims to decedency
â  from- English nobility have frequently
been' narrated in The Call, was con
victed this afternoon of forgery and his
; sentence will be pronounced by Judge
â¢ Ellsworth- one week from to-morrow.
Assistant District Attorney Melvin con
â  ducted the case for the people.
. Oubridge's trial consumed several
days of last week and nearly all of to
day, and the jury was out over two
hours.- He was charged in the infor
mation with rassing a fictitious check
an F. A. Wilder, manager of the Al
bany Hotel, for $300, signed by "Ned
Forester," from whom he borrowed
...divers small sums on the strength of
.. fhe same. The crime was committed
- last -May.
: â '.-.. Oubridge has numerous aliases. At
â¢" : different times he has assumed the
names of 'Cyrol Athol," "Weber C.
i Arlington," "H. St. Clair Oubridge,"
'.. "He-nrv Albridge," and in the present
case "Henry Percy."
In December of 1892 he was convicted
df forgery in Sar. Francisco and later
: in November, 1897, a charge of petit
larceny, was proved against him. A
; charge of â  grand larceny was dismissed
in his favor in November, 1895, and on
â¢April' 9, 1597, Judge Ogden discharged
f the prisoner, on a charge of embezzle
. merit.- He has each time managed to
keep .outside the San Quentln portals,
and in every Instance had good legal
aylviFers.fo look after his welfare. He
claims to receive an allowance from
â¢ ki's folks' in England, who have thus far
â¢endeavored to keep disgrace from the
â  family name.
In referring to his English ancestors
.. â¢ '.'Lord' Cyrol Athol" said, as he was be
ing returned to the County Jail to-day:
'The people across the pond'll have to
dig- up this time or stand the disgrace."
His attorney W. H. O'Brien, will ap
' 'peal the case to the Supreme Court,
and, aocordinf to Oubridere he will
fight the case "ur.til the most torrid
: zone in the hereafter is frozen and then
the fight will be continued on the ice."

DEATH OF A WOMAN FROM
" .' . BEER AND MORPHINE.
Sh(? Was Allowed to Lie Unconscious
' â¢ for Ten Hours in Jail Without
'.'â  .â¢. the Least Attention,
â¢ â¢ ALAMEDA, Aug. 23.â Yesterday morn- i
. <. ing -about" half-past 10. o'clock, a woman I
â¢was found in a helpless condition at the '
" corner pi Santa Clara avenue and Ninth
â  â¢ street. The supposition was that she was
' under the influence of liquor and the po
': li<?r. who were at once notified, soon con
' .'vey&d'-her in an express. wagon to the sta
. tlon and there put her on a cot, where she
â¢ â¢went to sleep. The officers paid no more
attention to her, strange to say, until 8
.o'clock in the evening, when one of them
â¢â¢ â¢ attempted .to rouse her from her stupor.
â¢"..He was considerably surprised to find her
â  'cold .and apparently dead.
â¢ â¢ Dra. Keys and Pond, who were sum
.rn.on.ed.. did -everything in their power to
restore the unfortunate woman, to con
. . sdousness, but without success. It was
v ascertained meantime that her name was
.â¢ Mrs/ S'jsan Thompson,. and that her home
â¢ wa-s at 765. Taylor avenue. At 1 o'clock
â â¢"â¢"some, of her relatives, who had been In
.- formed' her condition and whereabouts,
â â¢ took her to their home on Alound street,
â¢- '. where .she died a few hours later.
â . "The physicians are of the opinion that
â â¢ sire was the victim of an overdose, of a
'mixture of beer and morphine. Had she
.= .received prompt attention at the hands of
: â  the" police .when brought to the .station her
â  life might have been saved. Whether her
-.death was accidental or suicidal is not

FOLLOWING IN
LEAVITT'S LEAD
Harbor Commission Now
Wanted for Oakland.
A BILL TO BE PREPARED
WELL BE PRESENTED TO THE
NEXT LEGISLATURE.
Sweeping Nature of Councilman
Rowe's Resolution Relating
to the Water
Front.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway. Aug. 23.
The City Council has at' last come to ;
realize that the water front bill prepared
by Assemblyman Frank Leavitt two years ,
ago for introduction to the Legislature, j
but which was withdrawn at the request |
of several Oaklanders, would have great- \
ly facilitated the settlement of that intri
cate question. As matters have developed
Mr. Leavitt's plan was really anticipatory
of the action of the Supreme Court. It ;
provided for a Board of Harbor Commis
â lontrs, and this Is just what the City :
Council now desires. The resolution, of
Whlcfa Councilman Rowe is the author, ;
simply recites the situation and is aB fol
lows;
Whereas. The Supreme Court of this State i
Inthlw of the City of Oakland against the
Water Front Company has decided that the
intere-t of the Water Front Company does
not and cannot in any event extend waterward :
beyond the line of ordinary low tide, and
whereas, an ample margin exists between the ,
said line of low tide and the pier head line,
within which margin wharves, piers and other
facilities for commerce and navigation maj
be constructed: now therefore be it
Kesolved, That the City Attorney be and he i
is hereby instructed to draft a bill to be pre- j
sented for paesace to the Legislature at its
next session, providing for the creation of a
Board of Harbor Commissioners to take pos
session and control of that portion of the Kay |
of San Francisco and estuary of Pan Antonio ,
fronting en the City of Oakland, and defining
it-s powers; said board to be appointed by the
Governor of the State and to consist of three
members, each of whom to be a qualified, elec
tor ot the City of Oakland. â¦
The bill will undoubtedly be introduced
and' supported by the whole of the Ala- !
meda delegation, and will probably be j
made a plank in the county and legisla
tive platforms which will be adopted at
the county and district conventions to be
held on the 19th of next month.

A GLANCE AT
REAL ESTATE
Predicted Progress Is
Slow in Coming.
MARKET PRACTICALLY DEAD
FEW SALES OF MORE THAN OR
DINARY VALUE MADE.
A General Review of the Records.
New Building Contracts â Re
cent Sales and General
Notes.
Real estate was cheered but little during
the past week by the progress made In
the general market. Sales were few and
of but ordinary importance and of low
value. Few, If any, negotiations were
made that exceeded the importance or
merited more remark than that generally
afforded the ordinary random note.
Although better times are undoubtedly
in store for the near future to crown the
patient efforts of the realty brokers In
the city in trying to extricate themselves
for the past six months from long exist
ent stagnation they are slow in coming
and the predicted progress is hardly per
ceptible. .
Building operations for the past week
wt.ro slower than those of the preceding
seven days, there being few recorded ag
gregating a value of over $10,000.
The number and value of mortgages
for the past seven days were noticeably
smaller than the record for the preced
ing week. Few pledges were made ex
ceeding a value of $15,000. The releases
and reconveyances were also in a minor
ity, there being few given for more than
a 's9ooo value.

BLAZING OIL
SET FIRE TO
HER DRESS
Mrs. Powell Burned
to Death.
HER SCREAMS UNHEEDED
PERISHED IN HER ROOM ON
JESSIE STREET.
.alone and Helpless, Sne Was Unable
to Extinguish the Flames
That Enveloped Her
Body.
AUme and helpless, Mrs. Powell, aged
50 years, was burned to death last even
ing in h^r room at 433 Jessie street. The
unfortunate woman started to light a
coal oil lamp, when in some manner the
fluid became ignited, setting flre to her
dress.
Unable to extinguish the flames, Mrs.
Powell ran screaming through the hall
way, frantically calling for help. The
landlady endeavored to assist her, but
realizing her helplessness she ran to an j
open window and lustily shouted for the i
police. A citizen who was passing at once I
entered u;e house, and seeing Mrs. Pow
ell enveloped in flames ho seized a blanket
and wrapped it around her. After the ;
flames were extinguished the unfortunate j
â woman became unconscious, and realiz- j
ing that she was fatally burned the land- !
lady of the house had her removed to the
Receiving Hospital. Despite the efforts of
Police Surgeon Weil and his assistants
the unfortunate woman breathed her
last a short time afterward, without hay- i
ing regained consciousness.
An examination of her body disclosed
the fact that not a spot escaped the j
deadly flames. Her face was burned to i
an unrecognizable mass, and her limbs j
were charred and blackened. Shortly af
ter death ended her suffering her body
was taken in charge by the Coroner.
It is supposed that the unfortunate
woman had filled the coal oil lamp and i
was about to light it, when the flame I
from the match set fire to some oil which
bad been accidentally poured on the base j
of the lamp. In trying- to extinguish the |
names her dress caught fire, and with a
wild shriek she ran screaming through
the hallway.
Mrs. Powell leaves a husband who at i
one time was employed in the Custom- |
house. Some years ago he conducted a j
livery stable in Sacramento, where he
and his wife were well known.

TO BE COURT-MARTIALED.
Two Washington Volunteers
Will Be Punished for Circu-
lating a Mustering-Out
Petition.
The men of the First Washington Regi
ment, now doing garrison duty at the
Presidio, indignantly deny the statement
tuat they are desirous of being mustered
out of the service because they are not
going to Manila, They declare that, while
they enlisted to go to the Philippines,
thfty are soldiers enough to do whatever
duty is given them. They are contented
with their present duty, and regTet that
the?- should be put In the light of kickers
simply because of a few discontents who
circulated a petition asking that the regi
ment be musterdH out. The men who got
up the petition that was to have been
forwarded to the Secretary of War were
Privates C. 13. Witt of Company X and
G. C. Wlnkler of Company D, and at
present they are in the guard house as
a result of this breach of military dis
cipline, and will be tried by a court mar
tial.
The men persisted in circulating a pe
tition addressed to the Secretary of War,
asking that the regiment. Inasmuch as
the war was over, be mustered out of
the service. The facts In the case are
these: Every man In the regiment is
entitled to apply for his discharge if he
can show good reason for his leaving the
Bervice, and In every case the applica
tion, if the reason be a good one, ha 3
been approved by Colonel Wholley. When
Colonel Wholley learned of the petition
he ordered the men to desist from circu
lating it, as it Was not the proper way
for a petition of discharge to be -for
warded. The men were arrested under the
Blxty-oocond article* of war, for conduct
prejudice to pood firder and military dis
cipline. Colonel Wholley said yesterday
that every man. individually, had a right
to appiy for a discharge, provided he did
co in the proper manner. The two men
to the officers ever since they were mug
tertfvi in. UnÂ« <-i mem ia to .... cuÂ«caar&Â«d
for physical disability. They secured
only & few names, and these were of sol
diers who have been grumbling <-v> r
since they have beer. In the service. The
regiment as a whole is perfectly content
with its duty and station. The two pris
oners have b*en continually trying to
stir up discontent among the men.

WILL ENTER THE RING TO-NIGHT.
Welter-Weights "Dud" Eyans and Fred Muller, Who
Will Meet in a Twenty-Round Contest.
The National Athletic Club will pive a fistic show this evening in Wood
ward's Pavilion. Dudley Evans, the populnr welterweight pugilist of Port
land, Or., will meet his old opponent, Fred Muller, for the second time in
a contest of twenty rounds, and Evar.s' friends, who are many, confi
dently expect that the Portlander will turn the tables on Muller on this
occasion. Evans was one of Jack Demppey'p favorite pupils. According to
the statements of men who have seen Evans box, he should give a good
account of himself. A fifteen round bout between Henry Slater and
Young Peter Jackson (colored) should prove quite exciting, as Jackson is a
warm baby in the ring. "Kid" McFadden, a lightweight boxer who loves
to enter into a hot scrap, will argue ten rounds with "Bud" Terry.
De Witt Van Court has been selected by the club to referee the contests.
The betting la-st evening on the contests was Muller 2 to 1 over Evans;
Jackson 10 te 7 over Slater, and even money on the McFadden and Terry
bout.
Owing to the fact that Mul\er whipped Evans in Portland, the gam
blers look upon him as being a sure winner.

COLONEL HENSHAW ILL.
Because of Dizziness He Was Bled
More Than Was Good for Him.
CAMP BARRETT, Sather Tract, Aug.
23.â For the past two days Colonel Hen
j shaw has not been very much in cvi-
I dence about camp, and to-day it leaked
I out that the commander has passed
i through an experience that reduced
him considerably and might have re
sulted very seriously.
Colonel Henshaw had been complaining
of dizziness lately, and to relieve this
condition it was suggested that he be
bled. Regimental Surgeon Yost perform
ed this operation. When sufficient
blood had been drawn to relieve the pa
j tient. and Surgeon Yost had concluded
i to draw no more, Colonel Henshaw in
sisted that he continue. " This was done,
i with the result that the patient became
l completely exhausted, and grave fears
' were entertained for a brit-f period as to
his condition. He was doing nicely to
day, however, and is now gaining rap
idly In strength.
Three corporals and one sergeant were
reduced to the ranks to-day, because of
their overindulgence in spirituous liq
uors. The rules at camp are very strict
In such matters.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CAILX, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 24, 1893.
A CHILD OF
THE OCCULT
Viola Sickmon Visited by
a Strange Influence.
SHE IS BUT TEN YEARS OLD
BELIEF THAT SHE HAS RAR.fi
SPIRITUALISTIC POWER.
At the Present Time Nothing but Re
â¢ markable Physical Changes
Are Noted in These
Controls.
In a lodging house at 127 Second street
Is a little girl who is visited by spme
foreign spirit, and of such force is this
strange influence that mediums of ex
perience pronounce the child a marvel
with a future of spiritualistic potentiali
ties that know no bounds. Her name is
Viola Sickmon. She is Just 10 years old,
but advanced far beyond her years in
worldly wisdom and in those things that
are beyond the view of mortal ken.
Her mother mode an application yester- j
day to Frank Kane, the secretary of the j
Society for the Suppression of Vice, to
have the daughter taken care of durlri"
the next few years of her life. Th
reason of the mother's desire to separate
her daughter from herself and have her
placed in ._ corrective school is to free
the chiid from the possibilities of evil
that surround her In their present sphere.
The child's precocity and her evident
maturity, despite her years, have filled
the mother with forebodingÃ. Accord-
Ing to the mother, Viola, a child In
physique but aged in the experience of
the occult, is a natural medium. She is
as yet undeveloped and her potentialities
are great."
Up to a month ago Viola was regular'/
thrown into a state of violent physical
excitation twice in every twenty-four
hours. She would men beat the air wildly
with her hands anc 1 arms, and so great i
was her strength when in this condition !
that a very strong man using his full I
strength could not hold her. When her
arms were tied the little girl complained
of fierce inward struggles, as if her heart
was surging upwara and outward. So
great was the pain that the arms had to
be untied immediately.
A month ago these visitations from the
unknown world ceased, and the mother
hoped that the little child was free from
them forever, but yesterday they return
ed. Mrs. Sickmon is a believer in spirit
ualism and thinks that her daughter is a
natural medium. She will allow her
daughter to be taught the art and givo
her spiritual rower a chance to develop.
Some time ago a professional medium
lived in the house and she took Viola in
hand. Several spiritualists have been
consulted by the mother, and they pro
nounce "it a case of rare natural ability.
So far the spirits which take possession
of the girl have been unable to induce her
to talk. They have not succeeded farther
than to upset her normal condition and
generate a windmill motion of the arms.
The very- mention of spiritualism or me
diums in the presence of the child in
duces one of these strange physical dis
tortions. ______^_______
DR. J. T. EARNEST DEAD.
An Ex-Union Soldier Succumbs to
Cancer in St. Luke's Hospital.
Dr. J. T. Earnest died on Tuesday
evening at St. Luke's Hospital. Dr.
Earnest was a graduate of Jefferson Med

was practicing hfs profession in his na

broke out. He was appointed an assist
ant surgeon of the Sixtieth Regiment,
Tennessee Infantry, ana served with dis
tinction until the close of the rebellion.
Shortly after the war he came to San
Francisco and engaged in the grain busi
ness, and at one time was one of the most
prominent and successful operators. He
was a gentleman who made and had
many friends, and was of a genial and
kind disposition.

Wants Her Family Allowance.
Mrs. Theresa Bell filed an application
yesterday for an order compelling the
executors of the will of Thomas Bell-
George Stan eke and J. W. C. Maxwell â
to show cause why they should not pay
her family allowance. Mrs. Bed alleges
that there le still due from the executors
on that account a Bum exceeding $20,000.
By the last accounts tiled by the execu
tors it appears that they have in their
hands cash amounting to $866 09. Mrs.
Bell alleges that she believes that they
have other moneys in their possession,
but In the event such proves not the
case she asks that they be made to apply
the $SS6 OS In their possession on the ac
count.
ELECTRICITY
TO SUPERCEDE
STEAM POWER
The Printers Favorthe
Proposed Change.
PLAN OF THE NEW SYSTEM
STOCK OF THE STriAM POWER
COMPANY SOLD.
Purchased by Its Former Rival and
Competitor, the San Francisco
Gas and Electrical
Company.
The spirit of progress and Improvement
has entered that peculiar domain known
as "Printers' Row," the center of which
is at Sansome and Commercial streets. It
includes nearly all the great pilnting, lith
ographing 1 , bookbinding, electrotyplng and
type-founder plants, and some years ago
was the home of several of the daily
papers.
The motive power to run the machinery
of these various establishments has for
over a third of a century been supplied by
the Commercial Steam Power Works.
About two years ago this company in
stalled a large electric plant for the pur
pose of furnishing light and power to that
section. Its steam power was distributed
through several of the adjacent blocks
and with its increased facilities it became
a strong competitor of the big electrical
companies and gradually extended its
lines throughout that district.
It is stated that for some time past
there has been an understanding by which
the Commercial Steam Power Works con
fined their operations to a certain section
north of California street. However, this
arrangement became unsatisfactory to
the San Francisco Gas and Electric Light
Company and negotiations were begun for
the purchase of the property of the rival
company.
In order to obtain the sentiment of the
job printers and allied trades on the i|ro
posed change to electric motors, a meet
ing of the Typothetae was held on Mon
day afternoon and a vote on the question
as to whether it would be an advantage
or disadvantage to accept the change was
taken. With but a few exceptions tue
Impression was general that the new sys
tem would be a marked advantage instead
of a detriment, as was first supposed.
After considerable discussion, the few
who withheld from voting it into jreneral
favor accepted the conditions, which re
quired each Hrm to purchase and keep in
repair all motors used.
The concessions, if any, offered by the
new company were not "made public, but
it is stated that they are reasonable.
The venerable steam plant will be taken
out and the modern power installed in the
near future. The terms of the transfer
are private.
"LA GIOCONDA."
Artistically Presented by the Alter
nate Tivoli Cast Last Night.
Amlloare Ponchielli's great work, "La
Gioconda," was sung last night with the
second cast of principals at the Tlvoli.
As thiÃ opera has been produced exten
sively throughout the United States, a
few words about its history would not ko
amins. The composer was born at Pa
derno, Italy, in 1534, the son of a poor
organist. At the age of 11 he was ad
mitted as a student to the Milan Con
servatory of Music. His teachers, were
Angelini, Frisi and the immortal Rospl.
Ponchielli's talent was so wonderful that
he graduated from the conservatory in.
18S4 as a "maestro compositore."
His first opera was entitled "La Stella
del Monte," the second "I Promessl
Sposl" ("The Promised Bride"). In 1876
"La Gioconda". won for him a piace in the
foremost rank of modern dramatic com
posers. The libretto, partly founded on
Victor Hugo's drama, "Angelo, the Tyrant
of Syracuse." is one of the most powerful
and poetical works of modern times, and
is bound to fascinate the reader, even
apart from the music which it has In
spired. The name uf the librettist is
given as Tobia Gorrio, but it is no secret
I that we have Jiere pen anagram of the
j name of Arrlgo Boito, the brilliant writer
and composer of "Meflstofele."
To the connoisseur of good music it is
satisfying to hear the same grand opera
twice, sung by alternate casts. The
sense of comparison is stimulated, and the
management of the Tivoli must be aware
of this fact, as shown by their enterprise.
Miss Anna Lichter sane the part of La
Gioconda last night with her usual fervor.
She is capable of fine coloratures, and has
a marvelous control of her voice, appar
ently without any effort. Mr. Pruette as
Badoero cannot conceal his Anglo-Saxon
origin, but hiÂ« powerful barytone and fine
acting gave a very pleasing effect. Efl
gardo Zerni. as the hot-headed lover En
20, scored another triumph, and the au
dience rewarded him by repeated curtnln
calls. Mr. Schuster as the somber head of
the Inquisition deserves the fullest com
mendation. His deep basso voice has a
very pleasant sound, and T?s makeup w<". Â«
perfect to the smallest detail.
The sale of tickets for the next week of
"I Pagliacci" and "Cavallerta," alternat
ing with '"Mignon," has begrun. and has
already assumed large proportions.
IN THE DIVORCE COURTS.
Unhappy Couples Granted Decrees

MRS. BOTKIN UNDER ARREST
WILL BE BROUGHT
HERE AND HELD
FOR EXTRADITION
Warrant Issued on a Telegram
Charging Her With Atrocious
Double Murder.
Believed She Was Instrumental in Sending
Poisoned Candy Which Killed Mrs.
Dunning and Mrs. Deane.
An arrest has been maflo In the Dun
ning poisoning case. Mrs. W. A. P.ot
kln, the friend of J. P. Dunning, is In
custody, and a Delaware detective is
on the way to this city to secure her
extradition. The suspected woman is
accused of sending a box of poisoned
randy to the wife of the man she loved,
causing the death of Mrs. J. P. Dun
ning and Mrs. J. D. Deane.
The box of deadly bonbons reached
Dover, Del., Wednesday afternoon,
August 10, and that evening, after sup
por. the two victims and several others
partook of It. Mrs. Deane died the fol
lowing day. Mrs. Dunning died on the
night of August 12.
Assuming that Mrs. Botkln Is grullty
of the fiendish crime, the accepted the
ory is that she prepared the box in this
city and posted it Just before phe left
for Healdsburg on August 4. The mes
senger of death would have been deliv
ered at its destination August 9 or 10-
These dates are regarded as suggest
ively significant by the detectives.
STOCKTON. Aug. 23.â Mrs. Ada Bot
kin was arrested at the Windsor Hotel
this evening on two warrants charging
her with the most horrible double mur
der chronicled in many years. She Is
officially accused of aÂ«sassinatir>- Mr?.
John P. Dunning and Mrs. J. D. Deane,
who unsuspectingly ate poisoned bon
bons which had been sent all the way
from San Francisco ' Dover, Del.
When taken Into custody Mrs. Bot
kln was as calm as she was excitable
when the finger of suspicion was first
directed at her as the poisoner of Mrs.
Dunning and Mrs. Deane. The arrest
vtes expected, and when Detective Ed
Gibson of San Francisco and Chief of
Police J. D. Gall stepped Into her
apartments at the Windsor at S:3O they
were greeted with a cheery "Good evcn
.ng. gentlemen."
Detective Gibson came up on the
evening train. He went at once to the
office of the Chief of Police and remain
ed with Chief Gall a few moments. The
officers came out and walked leisurely
across to the hotel. They were not de
tained at the door. Mr. Botkin opened
It and intulttvely divining the purpose
stepped back to admit the officers. If
there was occasion for any embarrass
ment it was dispelled wh.-n the woman
gave them a cheerful greeting.
Detective Gibson had delivered the
warrant to Chief Gall and the latter ex
plained that it "became his duty to
place Mrs. Botkin under arrest," and
requested her to listen to the reading
r>f the warrants. Mrs. Botkin was seat
ed near the center of the room, while
her -husband stood near by, as calm as
though the ceremonial was any other
than one which made his wife and the
mother of his son a prisoner charged
with a most foul crime. Opposite the
woman who is now a prisoner sat Mrs.
Ruoff, a faithful nurse, who ha<? cared
for her during the excitement of the
'.ast few days. Mrs. Botkin was attired
in a natty tailor-made costume of a
dark hue. It might have been made
Tor a traveling costume, but there was
some irony in the fact that the Journey
was to be one of but a few blocks, end
ing at the County Jail.
As Chief Gail began to read the war
rant the little woman arose from her
chair with a dignified air and stood
[ucing htm. but with downcast eye. Her
{ace was calm but her breath came
quick and snort, showing that there
was an agitation within which was not
written on the face. There were two
. warrants, identical only that in one
the charge was the murder of Mrs.
Dunning and in the other Mrs. Deane.
When Chief Gall had finished the first
he hesitated and inquired if she waived
the reading of the second. "Oh, yes, I
waive that," said the prisoner, and she
sank into a chair. Her husband, a
dignified looking man, now drew near
er, as though to shield his wife, but he
had not a word to say. The grim Jail
now seemed to flash before the woman
for the first time.
"May I remain here under guard?"
she interrogated suddenly. Chief Gall
replied that the law left him no alter
native but to remove her to a cell. The
officers then gathered every scrap of
paper on which was any writing, and
told her that they must have her trunk
and contents as evidence. The woman
arose and assisted by her husband and
nurse began to pack the trunk. The
officers kept close watch and handed
her such envelopes and papers as they
desired.
"I feel quite calm now." the woman
said; " the excitement and shocks of the
past few days are no more."
Turning to h*>r husband, whom ehf
addressed as "Pop." she asked that he
send for h?r son Beverly. A reporter
went on this mission and found the
young man in the saloon with a frienJ
making the wine fly. When told of his
mother's arrest and desire to see him
he waved the matter asid" as not de
serving his attention. He has taken the
developments of the past few days
much to heart, and tho drunken con
dition in which he wa*Â» found this even-
Ing was his normal condition of the last
few days. When the trunk had been
packed it was strapped by Mr. Botkin
and Mrs. Ruoff assisted the prisoner in
putting on her bonnet. She drew a dark
veil over her eyes.
The prisoner ; was removed to a large
cell upstairs. The light in the cell was
soon out and silence prevailed. Later,
when a Call reporter approached the
cell It seemed that â¢ the woman was
talking to herself. It was dark, and at
the call "Mrs. Botkin." she " replied,
"Who is it. please?'* To every question,
which was asked her about her plans.
concerning Dunnin? or her past her
answer was always. "I have nothing
to say." Not another word would a
question elicit. When the cell door
was closed upon her she requested the
Jailer to admit no reporters- as she
"Never wished ! to see one ' again." .
. Detective: Gibson will .take his pris
oner to San Francisco on the -morning
train. s arriving there by , the 11:30 boat.
Her husband will accompany her, and
tt Is understood will leave his business
hen? in <-harge of his son and go East
with his wife when she is taken to
Dover. Botkln professes the greatest
confidence in his wife, and may be d< â¢
pended upon to see that she has even
right the law guarantees to an accused
person. He Is not a man of means, but
Is said to have friends who will see him
through any financial emergency.
Mrs. Botkln is no longer free of
tongue and given to ravings over Dun
ning. She has received advice from
her husband, she Bays, and as the pa
pers always grt everything wrong It
woulu do her no -oÂ«">d to make a state
ment in her own defense.
Detective Gibson was asked this
evening if the San Francisco office had
anything in the way of evidence other
than what has appeared in the papers.
He acknowledged that all the evidence
had not been made public, but he said
he was not at liberty to discuss the
case. He said the order for the arrest
did not come until after 3 o'clock, al- |
though it had been expected all day.
He has taken every precaution to see
that the woman does nothing rush. Not
only was she thoroughly searched by
the prison matron, but the cell was
thoroughly Inspected before the fair
prisoner was invited to enter.
"I am chagrined, that's aJI," she re
marked, turning to a reporter. "I am
not excited. I am not worried. I am
only chagrined over the disgraceful
publicity. ' The rattle of the patrol
wagon toward the hotel attracted the
usual crowd of loungers, and soon there
wae an anxious crowd around the en
trance to the hotel. Their curiosity was
soon rewarded. Two policemen "came
down the broad stairway carrying a
trunk which they placed in the' patrol
wagon. Shortly afterward Chief Gall
came out of the entrance with a lady
on his arm and handed her into a car
riage as gallantly as an escort. The
carriage was driven rapidly away. Be
fore she left her room for her trip to
the Jail the prisoner embraced her
nurse with "God bless you, God bless
you; I'll never forget your kindness.
All will be right yet."
She handed her husband her shopping
bag and exchanged a few hurried words
with him in an undertone. Then, tak
ing Chief Oall's proffered arm, she
walked from the room with all the
grace of a tragedy queen. The accused
wt-man it usually dramatic In her ex
pression, but said little this evening.
She wae gracious, but withal main
tained an austere and severe dignity.
The carriage containing Chief Gall
and his prisoner outdistanced all others
to the Jail, and when the o^her officers
and Interested persons reached the cor
ridor the woman was sitting on a chair
with her hand to her forehead. Detec
tive Gibson was Interrogated on tho
way over by Mr. Botkin as to when tho
order of arrest came, when he would
take his prisoner to San Francisco, and
If he wouM have the privilege of accom
panying her. The husband was readily
admitted to the lrner corridor, where
his wife was ?eated in plain view of
the people In the outer entrance. She
extended her hand to her husband, who
held it caressingly, she saying cheer
fully, 'Oh, it will be all right. Pop, don't
worry; it will be all right."
Mr. Botkin, who throughout the
trouble has conducted himself in an im
perturbable manner, now seemed af
fected, and he toyed caressingly with
his wife's hand while they exchanged
a few words. After being separated
from her for two years she now flees to
him not only with moral disgrace upon
her but a wnman charged with foul
double murder. He has defended her
and excused her In every way possible,
and his demeanor this evening Could

not fail to command respect and sym
pathy.
After Mr. and Mrs. Botkln had con
versed a few minutes Jailer Benjamin
motioned them into a private room,
where she was searched by the matron.
Her husband was present during this
ordeal. The woman was calm and in
quired about what time she was to be
taken to the city. She was under the
Impression that she was to be tried in
San Francisco.
So far as is known the Botklns have
not consulted an attorney since the
cloud arose over them, Botkln being
content to caution his wife to say noth
ing. Mrs. Botkln may be depended upon
to make the star female criminal, if so
she be, of the century. She has an in
telligent face, a neat form, is witty and
worldly wise. She has evidently nerved
herself for the ordeal and may be de
pended upon to stand it well.
Considerable credit is due Chief Gall
In the case. For three days Mrs. Botkin
has not left her room without his cog
nizance. He has gathered evidence and
handled every portion of his work w-ith
diplomacy and skill. He did not know
(libson was due here this evening, but
he soon found Police Judge R^nd->n and
secured the necessary counter signature
to the warrants. Mrs. Botkin would not
Bay where she stopped in San Francisco

to Healdsburg.

Attorney General of Delaware
Wired Chief Lees to
Hold Mrs. Botkin.*
The complaint drawn up by Chief
Lees, upon which the warrant was Is
sued, tells the story of the communica
tions between the scene of the tragedy
and this city which led up to the arrest

of Mrs. Botkin. There were a few pre
liminary telegrams of an unofficial na
ture, which are not contained in the
complaint, but have a material bearing
on the case. The first was received by
Chief Lees on the 19th lnst. and was
signed by John F. Dolan. Chief of Po
lice of Wilmington, Delaware. It was
as follows: "Wire brief account of
history, life and assentations of J. P.
Dunning, former agent of Associated
Press, and particularly his connection
with woman English birth."
The telegram was rather vague, but
Chief Lees went to work on the case
and the following day, the 20th- lnst.,
wired his answer as follows:
"Dunnlng's principal associate after
his wife left was Mrs. D. A. Botkin.
Had rooms in same house. Rather en

Then communications of a more offl
clal nature, and referring directly to
the relations of Dunning and Mrs. Bot
kin crossed the wires. They are all
contained in the complaint, which
reads:

. A similar complaint for the murder of
Mrs. J. D. Deane was prepared and at
3:30 yesterday afternoon Detective Gib
son presented the documents to Judge
Joachimsen. Warrants for the arrest
of Mrs. Botkin were issued and Detec
tive Gibson caught the 4 o'clock. boat
and started for Stockton. A telegram
time marked 5: 46 p. m. was received. by
Chief Lees from Gibson, which simply
stated "Mrs. Botkin" is arrested." : .
"The work was qulrkly done," said
Chief I/e*^, last evening, "after we
decided .hat Mrs. Botkin was the right
party. The delay in the Investigation
and subsequent arrest was due to lax
ity in the East, but, fortunately, every
thing Is now in proper shape to pro

prisoner to this city on the first train
leaving Stockton to-morrow, unless
habeas corpus proceedings interfere.
We hardly expect any such procedure,
however, and she will undoubtedly be
detained in this citr pending the arri
val of extradition papers from the State
in which the victims ate of the poisoned
candy."
WENT A LIVELY PACE.
Dunning and Mrs. Botkin
VVere Too Speedy for a
Drug Clerk.
Among the guests invited to Mrs.
Botkin's rooms was George L*. Beck, a
clerk in Isaacson'fe Pharmacy, corner of
Geary and Larkin streets. Dunning
returned from down town one evening
with a couple of quart bottles of whis
ky, and invited Beck to go up to Mrs.
Botkin's bed room, in Mrs. Moore's
house, in the same block. Responsive
to Dunning's knock Mrs. Botkin opened
the door and invited them to enter.
Beck said last evening:
"Jack Dunning returned from down
town about 10 o'clock one evening with
a couple of quart bottles of whisky. He
stopped at the drug store and invited
me up to Mrs. Botkin's room at No. 927
Geary street, in the same block. Dun
ning was feeling Jolly and seemed to
be in for a good time, and I accepted
the invitation. Mrs. Botkin was alone,
but upon Dunning's suggestion that
there ought to be another lady present
she .stepped out into the hall, and In a
moment returned with M.mc. Thomp
son. A bottle was opened and we had
a round of drinks. Dunning was inter
ested in the race track, and he and I
fell to discussing horse racing for a few
moments, while the ladies conversed
in an opposite corner. A little later
another round of drinks was had, and
some one suggested a. game of draw
poker for small stakes. While Mme.
Thompson was asking to be excused
another lady, not very tall, a brunette,
entered the room, and after cordially
greeting the others was introduced to
I me. but I did not clearly catch the
! name. It might have been Mrs. Seeley,
I d"n't know. In any event, she took
a hand in the proposed game of poker.
I Mrs. Thompson watched the game for
fifteen or twenty minutes and. after
bidding us good-night, retired from the
room. At first each of us took consid
erable Interest in the game, but after
an hour's playing it got to be so that
every time a pot or bet was taken we
had another round of drinks. Though
my memory is somewhat indistinct as
to the minute happenings of the even
ing, yet I am of the impression that
they did not indulge in the liquor as
heavily as Dunning and I.
The room was rather small, contain
in? a bed, bureau, center table, sofa
and ihree or four chairs, and about the
time the whisky was exhausted I re
alized the necessity of going outside for
fresh air. I bid the ladies good-night,
and Dunning accompanied me down
stairs to the front door.
"I was Invited up again, but declined,
giving as an excuse that the last event
was too speedy for me. Dunning and
Mrs. Potkin frequently stopped in the
drugstore and discussed the races. She
often came around and gave me 'tips'
which proved elusive and expensive.
"In conversing with Dunning she in
variably addressed him as Jack, but
at no time in my presence did she
evince more than a friendly interest in
hi.= welfare. She didn't appear to be
jealous nor conduct herself in a man
ner as would suggest she was In love
with him.
â After Dunning went to Cuba she
stopped In the store one day to tell me
that Â«he had received a letter from
Jack, and tliat he was homesick, and
anxious to return to San Francisco.
Then she wanted to give me a tip on a
horse race, but I declined with thanks.
"So far a? I observed Mrs. Botkln
conducted herself as a lady. and merely
acted as a friend to Dunning."
Beck said he regarded Dunning as
;m intimate friend. He reluctantly ad
mitted that Jack, as he called him. fre
quently h..ught whisky and mineral
water by the case and sent it to 92?
Geary street. Detective Gibson called on
him a clay or two ago. Beck said, and
closely questioned him as to whether
or not Mrs. BbUdn ever asked him the
effect produced by certain kinds of poi
son. " -She did not," I replied, and in
no manner did she remotely suggest
such a thing, nor in her demeanor or
conversation did she betray indications
of Jealousy. Although closely ques
tioned I could not give the detectives
any information of value."
Beck will leave for Los Angeles in a
f( â¢ days.

NEW YORK, Aug. 23.-John P. Dun

my correspondence is concerned I have
had no communication whatever with
her or any other woman in San Fran
cisco since my return from Porto Rico.
When asked what his plans were.
Dunning said: "I am here to settle up
some busings matters, and expect to
leave in a day or two for Dover to see
my little girl, who fortunately did iiot
eat enough of poisoned candy to more
than make her sick."
Dunning said that he did not intend to

staved there as 'ong as he did because
chance enabled him to retain a good
place there.
WHISKY BY THE QUART.
Mrs. Botkin and Dunning Had
Wonderful Thirsts for
Liquor.
Fred Nordholz. a bartender employed
by John Hadeler at 917 Larkin street,
corner of Geary, added a chapter to the
gay career of the newspaper man and
Mrs. Botkln. He said they bought the
beat brand of whisky he had by the
quart measure.
"Dunning and two ladles who lived
at Mrs. Moore's lodging house," he said,
"frequently came to the saloon in the
afternoon or late at night and bought
whisky by the quart. One of them, I
was told, was Mrs. Botkln. but the oth
er one who was about five feet two or
three inches tall and of a brunette
type I did not know. On several occa
sions the women came alone. Once or
twice while accompanied by Dunning
they appeared very gay and lively and
I have thought they were under the in
fluence of liquor. They seemed to be
treading very lightly and Indulged in
rather loud laughter. As I remember
now they usually addressed Dunning
as 'Jack*' or in terms of rather more
tender endearment. The three of them
were very speedy and appeared to be
thoroughbreds. I don't remember any
of them ever purchasing less than a
quart bottle of whisky at one time and
often It was two or three quarts.
"George Beck, a your? drug clerk
across the street, used to come over and
tell me of his visits to Mrs. Botkin's
rooms with Dunning and of the glorious
times <hey had there in the evenings."
Mrs. Moore, who is 82 y^ars of age,
Is suffering from nervous prostration
and has been removed from 927 Geary
street to No. 836 Turk street, where she
is being cared for by friends. After
reading Mrs. Botkin's story telegraphed
from Stockton in yesterday's Call, she
relapsed into a nervous prostration, her
nurses say. The statement made by
Mrs. Botkin that she was crazy and
that her son had died in the Stockton
insane asylum was too much for the
landlady and she succumbed to ner
vousness.
The attendants declined to permit any
callers to see her yesterday and said
that her mental anguish was very
great. _
MME. THOMPSON FOUND.
Will Not Tell What She Knows
Except on the Witness
Stand.
The much sought for "Mme. Bermel-
Thompson. from Paris, teacher of the
French language," has been located at
923 Geary street.
An inquiry for her at the above ad
dress sent a servant to the upper re
gions in search of this elusive young
woman, and the question came down
the stairway: "Another reporter,
Jane?"
Mme. Bermel-Thompson is a very af
fable woman and her face was wreath
ed in smiles.
"Oh. madame, your pardon. I was so
afraid you were one of those awful re
porters. And you do not know how I
have been besieged. For four days I
have seen no one; I have kept in my
own apartments. The papers all say
their people have talked with me, but I
have talked to no one except my
friends.
"But, again, pardon. Tou wish to see
me on business?" â and madame's eyes
were smiling and madame's lips were
smiling, showing a gleam of white.
even teeth.
When the Dunning. matter was men
tioned the smile left her eyes and lips
and her fare turned a chalky white.
Madame twisted a ring nervously about
her finger, and her hands shook; then,
she replied:
"I have nothing to say â positively
nothing. I have given my solemn
promise not to speak.
"Mr. Curtis told, me I was one big
little fool to talk so much, so I have
promised him and my lawyer not to
say one word more.
"What can I sty of Mr. Dunning?
He is so well known that my opinion is
of no value.
"Why, what do I know of these peo
ple? I was simply in the same house
with them. They were not my friends.
"No. I will not tell you whether I
was ever out with Mr. Dunning. I
must not talk; I have promised not to.
"Mrs. Botkln? Oh. no; we were not
friends.
"I have been worried to death over
this matter. My name has been bandied
about, as if I were the guilty one, and
I know nothing: about it. I shall say
no more until I am put upon the wit
ness stand, when I will tell of my rela
tions with these people."
Mme. Bermel-Thompson may be
French by birth, but certainly is not in
appearance. She is neither pretty nor
homely, neither young nor old, neither
stout nor thin. nor. in fact, is she any
thing that one would expect a woman
with a hyphenated name to be. ,
