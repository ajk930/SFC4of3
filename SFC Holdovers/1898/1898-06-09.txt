ON BOARD HERALD-CALL DISPATCH
BOAT, off Port Antonio, via Kingston,
Jamaica, June 8. â Even more picturesque
and bold than the defiance of the big Con
federate Merrimac by Ericsson's little
monitor was the exploit which resulted in
the sinking of the Spanish torpedo-boat
destroyer, brief particulars of which I sent
to the Herald and the Call yesterday.
Not a sign of the Spanish boat or
the sixty men comprising her crew has
been seen since the 13-inch shell fired
by the battleship Oregon struck her
amidships. Thi.s shot made an Ameri
can victory of an exciting hour's work
and thwarted the first attempt of the
Spanish to send reinforcements to Ad
miral Cervera.
The Terror succeeded In getting with

harbor, but the vigilance of the officers
on the New Orleans frustrated her
bold dash to join Cervera's fleet. lip
to the hour when I left the American
fleet Rear Admiral Sampson had been
unable to determine definitely the iden
tity of the vessel sunk by the Oregon's
1000-pound shell. There is little ques

ON BOARD HERALD - CALL DISPATCH
BOAT OFF SANTIAGO DE CUBA (via Kings
ton, Jamaica), June B.â Within twenty-four
hours after the arrival of American troops
the city of Santiago and the fleet of Admiral
Cervera will fall into the hands of the
Americans. This is the view of the Ameri
can fleet now guarding the harbor as I get
it from a prominent official on board the
flagship.
Rear Admiral Sampson has ac
complished all the destruction
possible until the invading army
is ready to attack the city. A
combined attack by land and sea
| will then be made. Meanwhile
the fleet can act only as a sentinel
at the entrance of the harbor.
Even as sentinels it is not likely
the ships of Rear Admiral Samp
son's fleet will have much to do.
By the slanting rays of the after
noon sun the smokestack and
masts of the Merrimac are plainly
visible from the sea. Hobson
and his men did their work so
well that the Merrimac was sunk
at a point where the channel is but
300 feet wide. If there were no
war and no blockade, naval men
assert, it is doubtful if Cervera's
cruisers could be steered past the
Merrimac. The wreck of the col-
Her might be blown up with dy
namite, but that would be no easy
task, even in time of peace, owing
to the great weight of coal in the
wreck.
The dispatch boat Three
Friends found about the entrance
of Santiago harbor a fleet of
United States men-of-war strong
enough to take Barcelona. With
this powerful force at his com
mand Admiral Sampson has been
studying for two weeks the plan
for his final attack. He has test
ed the strength of all the fortifi
cations and can speedily silence
those harbor defenses he did not
destroy in Monday's heavy bom
bardment. When I told the cap
tain of one of the American ves
sels that several thousand troops
from Tampa were about to be
landed in Cuba he shouted back:

SPANIARDS
DRIVEN FROM
THEIR WORKS
Splendid Marksmanship Again
Displayed by the Gunners
of Our Vessels.
CAPE HAYTIEN, Hayti, June 8. â Five American warships
at half-past 5 o'clock yesterday morning began to shell the forti
fications at Caimanera, on the bay of Guantanamo, which cuts into
the southern coast of Santiago de Cuba east of the city of San
tiago.
Many Spaniards are reported to have been killed. The
Americans' fire was most effective, driving the Spanish gunners
in consternation from the defense of their works and then from
the town of Caimanera, in which they took refuge. The inhabi
tants of this place joined in the rout.
The vessels which took part in the bombardment were the cruiser Marblehead, the auxiliary
cruisers St. Louis and Yankee and the two gunboats. The latter, however, paid little attention to
the Spanish forts, directing their efforts to cutting the cables which run out of Caimanera. Three
cables were cut under the protection of the larger vessels of the fleet. One of the cables severed was
that connecting Caimanera with the city of Santiago de Cuba.
The American fleet appeared of! the entrance to the Bay of Guantanamo just as the rising
sun began to redden the horizon. With the Marblehead in the lead, the little squadron sailed into
the bay and proceeded toward the cable house under the guns of the Spanish fortifications.
While the Marblehead, St. Louis and Yankee formed in battle order before the forts and
opened fire, the little gunboats darted out from the line and began to grapple for the cable.
The fire from the cruisers was rapid and well directed, and was replied to with vigor by the
Spanish. All the men on board the warships worked with enthusiasm, the New York naval re
serves on board the Yankee earning their share of the laurels at the guns. â¢
The bombardment was continued until the gunboats cutting the cables had concluded
their labors. This was at 2 o'clock in the afternoon. The fleet then sailed out of the bay and
took up a position about three miles from shore.
A cablegram from Caimanera received here to-day stated that the fleet was still cruising
before the entrance to the bay.
The shells from the warships early began to tell on the fortifications, the fire of which be
came weaker and weaker. One battery after another was silenced, until finally not a shaft of fire
or a balloon of smoke issued from the face of- the forts to tell of resistance. As the walls of the
fortifications began to tumble upon them, the Spanish gunners deserted their positions of duty and
ran to the town, which was in a state of high excitement.
With the silencing of the forts a still greater panic fell upon the residents of Caimanera,
who feared the Americans would complete their work by destroying the town, and there was a
general movement to places of safety.
Many shells from the American guns exploded in close proximity to the houses on the
outskirts of Caimanera.
A report reached here that several houses were struck by the projectiles, but I could not
confirm it. So far as I have been able to learn no damage was done the fleet.
It is believed in Caimanera that the forts were bombarded with a view to opening the way
to the landing of American troops near that point. With the withdrawal from the bay of the
American ships, those who had fled from the town ventured to return and the excitement was
succeeded by calmness.
The Spaniards there are apparently determined to offer a desperate resistance to the Amer
ican"; in any attempt to land troops and will make the best fight possible under these circum
stances. They are resolved at any cost to prevent the town and forts of Caimanera from falling
into the hands of the enemy. The military commander has issued an order to burn the town, if
necessary, to prevent the Americans from profiting by its occupation. Similar measures, it is un
derstood, are being taken at Santiago.
After the cessation of the firing from the forts, the fleet concentrated its fire upon the block
house at which the cables of the French Cable and Telegraph Company land, and speedily demol
ished them.
The cables which connect the blockhouse with Caimanera were cut. On account of the
cutting of the cable to Santiago telegraphic communication with that place is suspended. The
American naval dispatch boat Dolphin entered the harbor of Mole St. Nicholas, Hayti, to-day, and
fired a salute of fifteen guns.

CUBA, June 7. via Kingston Jamaica,
June B.â There is scarcely any doubt
that much greater damage than was at
first supposed was inflicted upon the
Spaniards in Santiago harbor during
the bombardment on Monday morning.
Many shells are believed to have fallen
into the city Itself, and when the facts
are known after the port has fallen into
Admiral Sampson's hands, it will prob
ably be found the loss of life was very
great.
Even with the meager facts now at
hand, It can be stated that this is the
result of the bombardment.*

Several Spanish military and naval
officers were killed and wounded. The
Spanish lohb of soldiers and marines
was heavy.
The city is now at the mercy of Ad
miral Sampson. The batteries at the
entrance to the harbor are on a crest
â¢180 feet above the water This high ele
vation made them difficult to hit, but
the entire hill was ploughed up by the
heavy shells. In many cases shells are
known to have passed over t'..e hill and
undoubtedly they struck the city it
self, as well as the shipping in the har
bor.
Thirty-four shots were fired from the
lowa's 12-inch guns, and thirty-eight
shots from her 8-lnch gun. There were
few shots from her secondary battery.
The other vessels engaged in the bom
bardment fired a proportionate number
of shots, and, as every one was well
aimed, the damage done must have
been tremendous2
DETERMINE
TO HOLD THE
PHILIPPINES
President and Cabinet Alive
to the Exigencies of
the Situation.
Colonel J. F. Evans of San Fran

toms at Manila.
WASHINGTON, June B.â That the
administration has not yet decided to
embark upon the new and untried ex
periment of colonial acquisition is cer
tain, but it is equally true that the
President and his Cabinet, after dis
cussing the disposition of the Philip
pines, are of the opinion that the exi
"gencies of the situation will compel us
to hold them permanently.
It is certain that the Philippines will
never revert to Spain. It is believed
that popular sentiment in this country
would not countenance such a thing.
The European powers are likely to be
come involved in a quarrel over the
Philippines, and It is expected that the
natural conclusion of this contention
will be our permanent tenure of the isl

The President lias decided to appoint
a collector of customs at Manila, and
The Call correspondent learned to-day
from a high source that Colonel J. F.
Evans of San Francisco will be the

dertd the appointment. Colonel Evans,
the veteran treasury expert, by reason
of frequent visits to Washington, cov

KEY WEST, June 4.â The steamer
Gussie returned to Key West this
afternoon from the north coast of Cuba, |
where she went several days ago for j
the purpose of landing 150 tuns of am
munition for the insurgent army. None {
cif the ammunition was landed, but the
expedition was not entirely a failure,
as it resulted in the gathering of some
important information from General
Gomez by Lieutenant Victor Blue of
the Suwanee, which, with the gunboat
Newport, acted as convoy for the Gus-
Ble. It would not do for me to say
where the landing was made by Lieu
tenant Blue, as it might defeat future
operations.
Nothing was seen of any Spaniards
on shore near where the landing was
made, but a Spanish gunboat was ob
served lying in a river leading from the
Pt_-a. The landing was effected on
Wednesday last. Lieutenant Blue go
ing ashore in a small boat with a crew
from the Suwanee. About a hundred
Insurgents were waiting on the spot
where the landing was made to receive
the ammunition which was expected
from the Gussie, but after Lieutenant
Blue looked the ground over he deemed
it inadvisable to risk s-nding the am
munition ashore in small boats at that
time.
The place was several miles inland *o
start with, and as the water outside
was too shallow for warships to get
close to shore, in addition to which
k>-ys interfered, the reaj purpose of the
expedition was abandoned. Lieuten
ant Blue, however, does not consider
the expedition an absolute failure, be
cause he gained much valuable infor
mation.
The Newport returned to Key West
with the Gussie. Both the Newport
and Suwanee had been cruising with
the fleet for ten days previous, and left
it to convoy the Gussie just as it was
about to start for Santiago. r

â¢ LONDON, June B.â The Paris corre

him to be appointed an officer of the

law Congress cannot create the office
of collector at Manila until a treaty of
peace is concluded betwe-n Spain and
the United States. But the President,
as commander of the army, can appoint
him an officer and Invest him with
power to levy and collect customs du
ties under the military government soon
to be established in the Philippines by
General Merritt. This will probably be
done and Colonel Evans will draw the
salary of a colonel or a major.
It is understood that it is the present
intention of the administration to con
tinue the rates of duty now in vogue
in the islands, but certain internal du
ties that are now regarded as oppres
sive by the people there will be abol
ished. Spain taxes everything tangible
and some things that ara not. Taxes
are levied and collected on oc.upations,
sales ano" possession of property, on
manufactures, and on certain kinds of
amusements, including cock-fighting.
All of these internal taxes will be abol
ished. Neither will there be internal
taxes on liquors oj tobacco, as in this
country. Spirituals, malt or vinous
liquors are not manufactured to any
extent. Tobacco raising and manufact
ure is one of the principal industries,
but the present intention is not to levy
a tax on the manufacture of tobacco,
but to derive all revenues from impor
tations and exportations. The former
amount to about $27,000,000 and the lat
ter about $33,000,000, according to treas
ury figures.
The levy and collection of an export
tax would indeed present an anomalous
situation, for the <.onstitution of the
United States expressly prohibits such
a tax, but under a military form of
government, such as will be instituted
and enforced in the Philippines, no re
gard need be paid to the constitution,
for the islands wil. not virtually be part
or parcel of the United States and they
will be exempt from the operation of
our constitution and laws and subject
only to thf> will of the President, who,
being supported by the American arms,
will be an absolute dictator.

MADRID, June B.â ln Madrid, or,
rather, Spain, the situation is extraor-
S dinary. Not a soul can do more than
! guess vaguely about what is going to
! happen. The Spaniards would wel
i come any peace that left them their
I colonies, but they are people who do
â  not reason, and therefore it is impos-
I sible to get from them any idea as to
â  how such a result could be possible.
More than one statesman declares that
I the country is going headlong to ruin.
Its financial condition daily gets worse
and the Government is divided upon
the point of how to raise money. All
means suggested are unpopular. Each
one mentioned is stated as likely to
cause a revolution.
At the same time there is a sort of
fatalism about the attitude of the peo
ple. They seem to care but little
whether victory or defeat comes. There
is absolutely no public enthusiasm, but
there is much vanity. Every one wants
peace but none has the courage to pro
pose it. The papers are at last realiz
ing the truth of the particulars given
in a recent issue of the Herald in which
the perilous state of Spain's internal af
fairs was pointed out, and suggestions
made about a possible peace. So far,
however, the only one that has dared
speak outright is, solidest of them all,
the Epaca. In fact, the situation is
undecipherable. Everybody is play
ing for time, and is purely an oppor
tunist.
TWENTY-SEVEN
THOUSAND MEN ON

Shafter's Invading- Army Convoyed

LONDON, June 9.â The Washington
correspondent of the Daily Chronicle,
with the approval of General Greely,
cables the following:
"The army sailed from Tampa at

numbers 27,000 men, composed of in
fantry, cavalry, artillery, engineers and

"General Shafter is in chief com
mand of the force, which is convoyed

goat Helena, while the training-ship
Bancroft is General Shafter's floating

Those aboard the American
warships have not yet ceased
talking about the visit of Admiral
Cervera's chief of staff to Samp
son. Why he came is already
known â to assure the com
mander that Ilobson and his men
were safe and properly cared for.
Several officers on board the flag
ship insist that this was a won
derfully diplomatic move on Cer
vera's part, as he was put into
good light before making that
surrender of his fleet which is re
garded as inevitable. These offi
cers believe Cervera realizes his
surrender is a question of only a
short time, cut off from escape as
he is and beleaguered in a port
where provisions are becoming
scarcer every day.
The belief is growing among
officers of the fleet that the war
will soon end. With the fall of
Santiago and the capture and de
struction of Cervera's fleet they
expect Spain will sue for peace.
"There will not be much more
slaughter in this war." is the way
one of the officers put the matter
to me. "It is practically settled
now. If Cervera's object was to
find the strength of the American
fleet his curiosity certainly must
have been satisfied."
When Admiral Cervera's rep
resentative finished his interview
with Admiral Sampson the sig
nal was given to all the ships to
concentrate near the flagship.
This order was promptly obeyed
and the Spanish officer saw file
before him the splendid ships of
his enemy, a demonstration
which seemed to be not without
effect upon the visitor.
While Cervera's chief of staff
was aboard the New York a dele
gation of Cubans was there ar
ranging for co-operation with the
American fleet. Their presence
was kept secret from the Span
iards, the delegation remaining
in hiding until after the Spaniards
had departed.

NEW YORK, June B.â A dispatch
from Cape Haytlen says: Colonel
Thenzo, a noted Austrian artUlerist,
who was with Ordonez at Santiago, was
so badly wounded that he has since

A dispatch from Key West says: The
Cubans have information that Cervera
has been ordered to dismantle and, if
necessary, to destroy his smaller ships.
The guns from these will be placed on
new fortifications on the land side of
Santiago and manned by ship gunners.
A dispatch from Kingston, Jamaica,
says: During the bombardment at
Santiago a shell from the Brooklyn,
thrown at long range into the inner
harbor, burst under the port quarter of
the Vizcaya, dismounted one of her
guns, damaged her rudder and injured
several seamen. Another shell burst
over the torpedo-boat Furor, tearing

PORT AU PRINCE, Hayti, June B.â
Confirmation of the reported landing of
American forces near Daiquiri, east of
Aguadores, Cuba, wap received here to
day. The Spanish milftary forces at
tempted to prevent the landing, but
they were driven back by the American
troops, aided by a body of Cuban in
surgents. Details of this engagement
are lacking, but the fact that the troops
landed shows the Spaniards were driven
back.
It is known a junction was formed
between the American forces and the

before midnight on Monday and that
the combined forces are entrenched at
Aguadores landing, a few miles east of
Santiago de Cuba.

than a mile distant. Owing to the dif
ficulty o<f keeping the searchlights on
the enemy, the signal burning above
the flagship ordered the flanking ves
sels to close in, firing as they steamed,
while the New York herself raced in
shore at full speed to head off the lit

Escape for the Spaniard clearly was
Impossible, but the destroyer only
hugged the dark shore closer and
steamed faster. She had gone un
scathed through nearly an hour's hail
of shot and shell from five American
vessels and "was now within a mile of
the entrance to the harbor.
There had been no miscalculations
aboard the New York, and the flagship
lay full across the destroyer's path,
when the Oregon got into the fight at
close range. Only 200 yards separated
the Spaniard and New York when the
men on the Oregon, after repeated ef
forts, got the range and used her big
guns.
A thousand-pound shell struck the
stranger full on deck amidships and
ended the chase as suddenly as it had
been begun. The broad beam of the
searchlights disclosed only black water
under lowering hills. No sign of the
enemy the five vessels had been pursu
ing for nearly an hour could be seen.
Presently the iron-clads, the midnight
tragedy being finished, moved back
through the brilliant moonlight to their
old positions.

Mr. Loud (R.) of California present

ed without debate.
Smith (R.) of Mi :higan then called
for the Lacey bill to enaule volunteers
to vote at Congressional ele -tions dur
ing the war the bill having been made
the special order for to-day. King (D.)
of Utah moved to adjo-. n, but the mo

the conclusion of Powers' speech and
the close of the session, like the open
ing, was marked by a Hawaiia.. inci
dent in which Crosvenor likewise
figured.
Smiui moved to adjourn pending the
disposal of the bill, and Grosvenor was
instantly upon his feet, protesting that
he had a parliamentrâ â  inquiry. It was
to find the effect of adjournment that
Grosvenor aro?e. * wrangle ensued
pending the vote to adjourn, during
which Grosvenor, in resp^ .se to some
near-by member -who had suggested
adjournment would be equivalent to
continuing the order mak.ng the elec

angrily:
"Yes, I know It is a continuing order,
and it is a continuing order to obstruct
the passage cf the Hawaiian resolu

There was ; ripple of applause at
this from members favoring annexa

comment Lacey (R.) of lowa was heard

After the commotion was quieted in a
measure Grosvenor put his query to the
Speaker, who said the effect cf adjourn

morrow immediately after convening,
but he added, replying to a further
query, that the question of considera

CENSUS BILL PASSED.

WASHINGTON, June B.â A bill pro-y
viding for the taking of the twelfth'
census was passed by the Senate to
day after a debate which occupied the
greater part df three days. Several
weeks ago a census bill was presented
by the committee having the matter in
charge, but the measure was so unsat
isfactory that it was recommitted to
the committee. The bill passed to-day
was introduced in lieu of that which
was recommitted, and, as slightly
amended, received the unanimous sup
port of the Senate. Under it, if it
i should become a law, a director of the
census, an assistant director and five
expert statisticians will be appointed im

DEFENDERS OF
MANILA READY
TO SURRENDER
Prefer American Mercy to the
Danger of Massacre by the
Rebels.
MADRID, June B.â lt Is rumored the Spanish garrison at Manila,
rather than be massacred by the insurgents, prefers to yield to the
Americans as prisoners of war.
On account of the serious news from the Philippines, the leaders
of the minority parties in the Chamber of Deputies met Senor Sagras
ta to-day to consider the situation. The Premier strove to convince
them of the gravity of existing circumstances, urging that they
ought immediately to adopt the budget and to declare that the Cham
ber would sit in permanence. Senor Mella, Carlist, asserted the Gov
ernment had abandoned its pledges and he blamed it for a "system
of silence," declaring:
"The nation which would suffer a Sedan in silence could not deserve
to figure in history."
Senor Sagasta replied: "The .Government is not responsible for re
sults in the Philippines nor the course Admiral Cervera has taken.
The Government must execute its plans and must not reveal them,
which would be unpatriotic."
General Correa, Minister of War, declared Captain General Augusti
would defend himself to the last. Senor Silvela sr.id:
"The moment has arrived to take supreme resolution."
General Domlngues believed the intervention of the powers was
imminent, "because the fate of the Philippines interests all Europe."

NEW YORK, June B.â A copyrighted
dispatch to the World from Hongkong
says: A report has reached here that
Manila has fallen. It is said to be now
occupied by the Philippine insurgents,
commanded by Aguinaldo. The rebel
Junta and wealthy Philippine Islanders
resident here are jubilant over the news
and the United States Consulate has
been crowded all day.
The American consul, Mr. Wildman,
has been the recipient of hundreds uf
congratulations from the Junta, giving
him almost as much credit for the re
ported capture of Manila as they gave
to Aguinaldo himself, since Mr. Wild
man has been their unswerving cham
pion and has advised them In all their
pla.ns.
Consul Wildman does not credit the
report that Manila has actually been
occupied, but he believes that it will
be by or before next Saturday.
The Spaniards have been fighting
desperately, but their marksmanship is
poor and they have lost heavily.
MADRID, June B.â The following
communication from Captain-General
Augusti, dated at Manila, June 3, has
been published:
'The situation is very grave. Agui
naldo has succeeded in stirring up the
country and the telegraph lines and
railways are being cut. lam without
communication with the provinces. The
province of Cavite has completely re
belled and the towns and villages are
occupied by numerous bands. A Span
ish column defends the Zapote line to
prevent the enemy from invading the
province of Manila, but the foe has en
tered through Buluean, Laglna and Mi
ron, so that Manila will thua be at
tacked by land and sea.

"I am striving to raise the courage
of the inhabitants and will exhaust
every means of resistance, but I dis
trust the natives and* the volunteers be

ready bpp-n seized by the enemy.
"The insurrection has reached great
proportions, and if I cannot count upon
the support of the country the forces
at my disposal will not suffice to hold
the ground against the enemy."
General Correa, Minister of War, and
Captain Aunon, Minister of Marine,
have gone to the palace to confer with
the Queen Repent as to General
Augusti's communication. It is report
ed that the Spaniards at Manila have
already been compelled to take refuge
in the fortified part of the town.
LONDON, June B.â The Madrid cor
r< spendent of the Standard says: El
Liberal calls upon the Government to
take f teps promptly to satisfy public
opinion, which is clamoring for the im
mediate dispatch of a relief expedition
to assist Captain-General Augusti in
forcing the Americans to leave Manila.
This alone, the paper argues, would
put a stop to the spread of agitation
and disaffection among the natives of
the island of Lijzon. The nation, says
El Liberal, has remained patient only
because it was believed that the Gov
ernment would readily arrange such an
expedition.
El Imparelal advocates a similar
course.insistlng that the fate of Span
ish rule in the Philippines could in this
way be easily decided at Manila.
El Heraldo is even more energetic in
its calls on the Cabinet to act before It
is too late.
The press campaign is evidently
tended to exercise pressure upon

the natives.
The Americans have been preparing
defenses at the mouth of the bay ever
since thp Spanish authorities set the
rumor alloat among the natives that a

was expected very shortly.
The religious orders and the paro

sistance to Captain General Augusti,
with the object of supporting the ef
forts of the orders in Madrid to deter
the Government from granting reforms
likely to trench upon their privileges
and the" influences they exert in the ar
chipelago.
Senor Sagasta is maneuvering very
dexterously and refraining from giving
any pledges either to the friars or the
reformers, on the plea that in the pres
ent circumstances any definite solution
must be postponed until the end of the

RUM'S ENEMIES
IN CONVENTION
Prohibitionists Meet at
Fresno.
WILL NOMINATE A TICKET
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, June B.â The State con
vention of the Prohibitionist party met
here to-day. The convention was held
in Armory Hall, which had been appro
priately decorated for the occasion.
Cold-water tnnks wore much in evi
dence among the banks of flowers.
The convention was called to order
at 10 o'clock this morning. Theodore
D. Kanouse of Edendale was elected
presiding officer and Dr. Stephen Bow
ers of Los Angeles, who is editor of the
California Voice, secretary. â  The con
vention was opened with a prayer by
W. O. Clark. This was followed by an
address by Rev. J. W. Webb, respond
ed to by Dr. Bowers. Rev. A. A.
Graves of this place made a third
speech. He declared the church had
gone into politics because the devil had
gone there and made it necessary-
The greater part of the forenoon was
taken up with addresses on the subject
of temperance. Robert Summers, an
attorney of San Jose, and Henry J.
French of the same town, who was
once before the standard bearer of this
State, may enter the field for Governor.
For the Lieutenant-Governorship has
been mentioned F. R. Shafter of Santa
Clara. A full Congressional ticket will
be nominated,, but no names have been
presented for the various districts. The
absence of any caucus or lobby pre
cludes the possibility of prognosticat
ing candidates.
Committees appointed by Chairman
Kanouse were:
in
the
Permanent organizationâ C. T. Clark,
Napa- J. R. Bean, Solano; W. W. Whar
ton, Fresno.
Platformâ J. E. McComas, Los Angeles;
Miss M. A. Thompson, Alamoda; W. O.
Clark, Amador; Mr. Leonardson, Los An
geles; Rev. F. E. Coulter, Fresno; S. P.
Mends, Alameda; 11. I-. Kuws, Merced.
Financeâ C. L. Meracle, Fresno; Mr.
DalLy, Los Angeles; C. J. French, Ven
tura"; Miss M. A. Thompson, Alameda.
Credentialsâ Dr. S. B. Bowers, Los An-
Kclos; B. H. Hoad and J. W. Meble,
Fresno.
The afternoon session, after 3 o'clock
was chiefly devoted to addresses de
livered by T. D. Kanouse and Rev. E.
Leonardson of Los Angeles. Plans of
work for the coming campaign were
earnestly discussed. On behalf of
friends Rev. J. W. Webb presented Mrs.
Richardson, assistant superintendent of
the Band of Hope, with a gold and
enamel Good Templar badge.
The new State central cc mmittee was
chosen. It will organize to-morrow
after nominations are made and plat
form and resolutions adopted.
To-night there was a red fire, firing
of anvils and spirited addresses by
ladies and gentlemen of State reputa
tion. This will be repeated to-morrow
night as a ratification of the State
ticket. The sessions are very harmon
. ious.
GANG RULE
REBUKED IN
SANTA CLARA
Great Victory Won by the
Advocates of Pure
Politics.
Candidates That Were Backed by
Boss Rea Defeated in Almost
Every Instance.
SAN JOSE, June B.â The school elections held throughout the
county were, taken as a whole, a great victory for the better element
and people who believe in pure politics and on the other hand was a
hard blow to the Rea gang.
More than usual interest attached to
the elections and both sides were out
in force working for their candidates.
In the Hester District the election
was unusually warm, and the gang did
their best to carry the day, but they
were unsuccessful. Charles D. Blaney,
the people's candidate, was elected by
a good majority over Albert Currlin,
Rea's candidate. Everything: possible
was done to defeat Blaney, as in his
defeat Rea saw a chance to knife H. G.
Squier, the principal of the Sunol Hes
ter School, who is an avowed enemy of
the ring. Squier has been persecuted
by the gang for several years, because
he refused to do its bidding. Their
enmity against Squier arose when he
was principal of the Longfellow School
some years ago and they succeeded
then in securing his dismissal.
A couple of years ago the citizens of
the Hester school district threw off
gang rule, and Frank P, Montgomery,
one of Rea's pets, was dismissed and
Squier given the place. This was a
bitter dose for the gang, and the ha
tred of Squier increased. Since then
war has been openly declared against
him. Nothing has been left undone
to injure and beat Squier, but, so far
the better element has remained on top.
A short time ago the gang tried to
divide the district in order to accom
plish its end. A bitter contest was
waged before the Board of Supervis
ors, but without result. The election
of Blaney is another victory for Squier.
J. H. Jackson of the night school and
Elmer Brownell of Mountain View,
both gang men, are slated for advance
ment, and if the recent election had
been carried by the gang one of these
two would have probably succeeded
Squier.
East San Jose is another place where
school matters were active on election
day. Here, also, the gang was de
feated, C. A. Bates being elected over
A. J. Conwell.
At Milpitas, Henry Abel, the people's
choice, defeated the gang candidate by
100 votes.
At Saratoga, Trustee Cunningham
walked away from Rea's man.
In the other districts throughout the
county the elections resulted about
even, and where gang men were placed
in power they are of the better class
and not persons that will do the petty
bidding of Boss Rea.
SAN JOSE CAPITALIST
INDICTED FOR FORGERY
Seven Counts Againrt Abram King
for Mismanaging the Estate of
an Insane Person.
BAN JOSE. June B.â Abram King, a
prominent capitalist of this city, ex-
Supervisor and until recently vice-presi
dent of the First National Bank and
president of the Security Savings Bank,
was this afternoon indicted by the Grand
Jury on seven counts for forgery in con
nection with hie management of the eÃ
tate of Stephen Hobson, an inaane person.
King was the guardian of the estate for
nineteen years, and when Hobson died
Kings accounts were called In question.
About a month ago a trial of the issues
in the Probate. Court resulted in a Judg
ment against King for over $13,000, this
imount, so the record runs, having been
taken from the estate by means of for
geries, raised bills and the withholding
:-f large sums. Immediately after the re
turning of the judgment the matter was
brought before the Grand Jury, with the
result stated. A bench warrant was is
sued for King's arrest, and it was served
late this evening. He will give ball in
the morning.
Engineer Killed at Sacramento.
SACRAMENTO, June B.â Warren Wai- !
dron, who had been a locomotive engi
neer on the Folsom railroad for over forty
years, was killed to-day. He was work
ing about his engine in the round house ;
when he slipped from it and fell. His
right temple was crushed in by strik
ing a piece of iron, and death was almost
instantaneous.
Two New Justices of the Peace.
SAN JOSE, June B.â The Board of Su
pervisors to-day appointed R. R. Bell

OPIUM, MORPHINE
Or Cocaine "Habits" Now Pri-
vately Cured at Home.
A SIX DAYS' TREATMENT SENT ON TRIAL
BY MAIL TO ANY ONE WHO HONEST-
LY DESIRES TO BE CURED.
Remedy Contains No Opiates or Po'sons.
Cures the Dreaded ''Habits" Per-
manently Without Suffering.
Dr. Carlos Bruisard, a well-known prac-
titioner of Cincinnati, Ohio, after many
years' close study has discovered a rem-
edy that permanently cures the mor- ,
ph.ne, opium, cocaine, laudanum and slm- '
similar habits. The remedy cures without
causing pain, suffering or nervousness, j
and removes all desire for stimulants. No i
opiates or other narcotics are contained
in the remedy, nor does the treatment
Interfere with the patient's daily occupa-
tion. The cure is complete and perma- '
nent and leaves the patient In a condi-
tion of perfect health.
Dr. Bruisard carries his ideas into prac-
tlcal effect by sending a six days' treat-
ment on trial to any one who actually de-
jrtrea to be cured. This will enable the
patient to test it at home or wherever
he may choose, and there is absolutely
no question that he will be cured.
Dr. Bruisard has saved thousands of
bright men and women from a life of
slavery and degradation. He has the
remedy. There is no doubt about it. It
is as certain to cure as the world is cer-
tain to revolve on its axis. This should
deeply interest the thousands who are i
being dally dragged to their torture
by the terrible use of narcotics.
It Is certainly a very generous act of
the doctor to send his remedy on trial
and thus let all see and realize that they
will be cured at their homes permanently,
without any suffering, detention from
business or loss of time.
Write privately to Dr. Carlos Bruisard,
166 Glenn Bldg., Cincinnati, Ohio. The
utmost confidence prevails between the
doctor and hla patients.

NEW YORK, June B.â News has Just

of a victory achieved by the Cuban
forces over a division of the Spanish
army at Jifruani, Province of Santi

decisive battles which the patriots had
gained In many months, and the most
Important one Bince war was declared
by the United States against Spain. A
column of Spanish soldiers, 1300 strong,
acting under orders from Havana to
abandon the interior towns and ad
vance toward the coast, evacuated the
town of La Piedra, after having de
stroyed their fortifications to prevent
them from falling into the hands of the
Insurgents, and camped at Jiguani,
vhere they expected to remain, await
ing further orders. They were also
Joined there by a detachment of 300
Spanish soldiers from Santa Rita and
the two forces wero united in the
camp at Jiguani.
The Spaniards were surprised on the
morning of May 22 by being attacked
by a division of the First Corps be
longing to General Calixto Garcia's
command, under the leadership of Col
onel Jose Jesus Rabi. With him were
Colonel Lora, commanding the First
Cavalry, and Colonel Montaire of the
Infantry regiment, "Cuba Libre." The
Cubans altogether numbered a little
over 1000 men, while the Spaniards had
fully twice that number.
The Cubans advanced in good order,
being well equipped with arms and am
munition, and took the enemy com
pletely by surprise. At the start the
Spaniards scattered, but afterward
they made an effort to rally their
forces. They succeeded only to the ex
tent of retreating in regular order to
the village of Palma. There they
were reinforced by several hundred
men from Aguicota and Arrota Blanco
and turned upon the Cubans, and the
battle was renewed with fury.
The Spaniards were beginning to re
cover some of the ground which they
had lost, when, at a most opportune

moment, the Cuban Augileraie Regi
ment came up from General Garcia's
command and attacked the enemy in
the rear. Simultaneously with this the
Regiment Santiago attacked them upon
the left flank, so that the Spaniards
were forced to fight, hemmed in on
both sides.
The Cubans succeeded in taking sev
eral advantageous positions, which they
maintained throughout the fighting. In
their night from their camp at Jiguani
the Spaniards were forced to leave be
hind them much of their ammunition
and supplies, so that they were to a
considerable extent handicapped in
fighting, while on the other hand the
Cubans seemed to be well equipped and
on the aggressive.
After six hours' hard fighting at Pal
ma, which is only a short distance from
Jiguani, the Spaniards raised a flag of
truce and expressed themselves as
willing to surrender. Terms were
speedily arranged and the Cubans took
as prisoners one Spanish colonel, seven
captains and several other officers, be
sides 104 soldiers. The Spanish loss
amounted to seventy-six dead, besides
a large number wounded. Included in
the Spanish losses were thirteen offi
cers.
The Cubans sustained a heavy loss,
but it was considerably smaller than
that of the Spaniards. It is reported
there were forty-five killed, including
five officers of minor rank, and about
sixty wounded.
After the battle the Cubans returned
to Jiguani. There they secured a large
quantity of arms and ammunition from
the deserted Spanish camp, together
with provisions and supply wagons.
These were sent to the headquarters
of General Garcia's camp at Bayamo.
The people of the towns of Jiguani
and Santa Rita came out to Treet the
victors, and there was great rejoicing
among the inhabitants, who before that
time had been forced to conceal tlTeir
sympathy, while the towns were occu
pied by Spanish soldiers. General Jesus
Rabi at once set at work organizing a
civil government for the towns, acting
under the orders of General Garcia in
a proclamation which he issued two
days after the battle.

SAN RAFAEL IN
A COMMOTION
Exciting Affair Occurs in
the Night.
APPARENTLY AN ABDUCTION
A YOUNG WOMAN'S SCREAMS
FOR HELP.
Driven at Furious Speed Through the
Town by a Mysterious Well-
Dressed Man, Who
Eludes Pursuit.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, June B.â An exciting
incident of a most peculiar nature that
has caused no end of wonder and com
ment occurred here last evening. City
Attorney Thomas Boyd, F. Schoneman.
and L. Lavios- were the principal wit
nesses and they are as much at sea in
regard to the affair as anybody else.
The three men were standing in front
of Laviosa's residence on the corner of
Fourth and H streets engaged in
friendly conversation when they were
startled to hear a succession of pierc
ing screams, and turning beheld a two
seated open carriage, drawn by a large
sorrel horse, whirl rapidly around the
corner and out Fourth street at break
neck speed. On the front seat were a
fashionably attired man and a young
lady, dressed in clothing of a light
shade. The man was driving and in
dustriously plying the lash to the horse,
while the girl was shrieking and
begging to be released in agonizing
tones. On the rear seat sat an elderly
woman who uttered no sound and made
no motion.
The three witnesses yelled to the
driver to stop, but he paid no heed to
them. They ran after the vehicle for a
short distance, but to no purpose as it
was traveling at too high a rate of
speed. By this time the sidewalks were
filled with an excited crowd that rushed
from the houses in the vicinity on hear
ing the screams.
As the carriage passed out of sight
before it reached the point where tho
road branches â one fork leading to
Fairfax and the other to Tamalpais â
the girl's cries abruptly ceased and she
fell back on the seat, evidently in a
fainting condition.
The most puzzling part of the mys
terious affair is that the girl would ap
pear to have been abducted, yet not a
clew can be obtained to aid in solving
the affair. The carriage came from a
fashionable quarter of the city, but no
body seems to know of any girl disap
pearing. At the time the incident oc
curred the moon was shining brightly
and the driver was observed to wear a
tall silk hat, while the vehicle was new
and of modern design and the horse '
was richly caparisoned. It is believed .
from the circumstances and especially ]
the direction taken that a serious crime â 
may have been committed.
THBEE CHILDREN CREMATED.
One Throws a Lighted Match in a
Can of Coal Oil.
PITTSBURG, June 3.â Three children
met death in a frightful manner last
evening in Allegheny. By the explosion
of a can of oil their clothing was ignited

that they died in a short time.
The victims were Ella. Edith and Har
vill Watts, children of Charles Watts of
Fern Hill, near Woodsrun avenue, aged !
respectively 11 and 7 years and 4 months.
The eldest child proved herself a he
roine, for with the flames ro.i sting her
body she tried to carry her baby brother
to a place of safety. Mrs. Watts was also
burned in trying to save her children.
The children were playing in an out
house in the yard and one of them struck
a match. In the same room was a larpe
can containing two gallons of oil. When
the match was thrown down It dropped
into the can and the explosion followed
instantly.

Society Will Grace the Occasion by
Its Presenceâ A Grand Mili

Game.
A great game of baseball will be played
at Recreation Park to-day. The Thir
teenth Minnesota Volunteers, who have
so kindly offered to do anything in their
power to assist the Red Cross Society,
have had their baseball team out prac
ticing daily during the past week, and the
men of the regiment are very much elated
over the prospects of their club. They
have asked, the colonel to allow them to
attend the game in a body, as they are
desirous of being there to "root" for
! Minnesota.
Every patriotic American should attend
i and do honor to the cause by encouraging
the home boys as well as the visitors.
There is no doubt that the game will
be a lively one, as both sides have their
State pride at stake.
The ladies should remember that the
umpire has been chosen by one of their
sex, find they should be on hand to pro
tect him from harm, as they will be held
responsible for any difficulty that he
might get into through his decisions. The
umpire has the hardest position on the
ball field, it is almost impossible for him
to please all, and if he should give a
decision to displease the excited players
of either side, some one should be present
to console him. There is no doubt that if
the committee were to disclose his name
at this time every lady in the city
who wears a military button would be
there in his behalf.
Through the kindness of the colonel of |
the regiment the celebrated Minnesota
band will' be present and will give a grand
patriotic concert before the game.
The players will all appear on the bat
tlefield completely equipped for the base
ball war, and to do credit to their re
spective supporters.
The following will be the formation of
the troops to do battle:.

OF THEIR OWN
THE SAMOA AND CHARLES NEL
SON GET AWAY AT LAST.
Successful Test of a New Automatic
Distributing Nozzle on the Fire
Boat Governor Markham.
The Klondike steamer Samoa got away
j for St. Michaels yesterday with the barge
Monarch and the stern wheel steamer
Clara in tow. The Clara is on the deck
of the barge, and before the Inspector of
Hulls and Boilers would allow them to
go to sea they were boxed in and built
Up until they looked like the famous
Merrimac of the civil war. As the Samoa
and her town passed along the front the
general remark was that the expedition
was a most foolhardy one.
Before the vessel got away there was
some trouble aboard. Captain Jahnsen
got exuberant and kissed one of the lady
gassengers. Just as he did so the hus
and appeared on the scene and the gal-
I lant skipper got a black eye for his gal
lantry.
There was trouble also on the Klondike
steamer Charles Nelson before she got
away for Seattle. The crew shipped for
$40 a month, and some union sailors in
duced five of them to desert. Five other
men were secured in the place of the de
serters and another attempt to get them
off was made. An old employe of the
owners of the Nelson was going aboard
when the striking sailors Jumped on him
and gave him a beating. A free light fol
lowed, and finally a union man, who gave
his name as John Smith, was arrested
by Officer George Lake.
The British ship Lismore is only out
thirty-six days from Newcastle, N. S. W.,
for this port, and yet 7 per cent re
insurance has been paid on her. The
Crown of India, which left Newcastle the
day after the Lismore, was caught in a
hurricane and partially dismasted. She
was afterward towed into Sydney. N. S.
w. ( in distress. It is this fact and not
that the Lismore is overdue that has
started the reinsurance deal.
A larjje party of insurance men and
j underwriters went out on the State tug
j Governor Markham yesterday to witness
a test of the Judge automatic solid stream
and distributing nozzle. The vessel put in
at Powell-street wharf, and there Chief
Sullivan and several members of the Fire
Department joined the party. The test
was a genuine Buccess, and Chief Sulli
van said the nozzle was a most valuable
addition to the fire extinguisher appli
ances. It is an automatic affair to bo
fastened to a standpipe or located on the
upper floor of tall buildings and will throw
water so as to flood the floor, ceiling and
walls at the same tlm*'.. It looks like
the cylinder of ?\n engine from one end
of which projects an ordinary nozzle. The
action of the water when, forced into the
cylinder sets wheels In motion which
cause the nozzle to swing up and down,
describing an arc of 60 degrees. At the
same time the contrivance rotates In
an arc from side to side, describing an
angle of 90 degrees. With a forty pound
pressure the water can be forced through
the nozzle a distance of 250 feet. It is
the invention of John H. Judge, a veteran
fireman of Milwaukee.
News arrived in the city yesterday of
the total loss of the schooner J. N. In
galls on the Mexican coast. She left here
on May 3, last, and while trying to Â«nier
Agiabampo on the 3d inst., went ashore.
The particulars of the disaster are very
meager. The crew was saved, but the
cargo, it is thought, will be lost with the
vessel.

THE CITY'S SUIT
AGAINST WIDBER
TESTIMONY TAKEN BEFORE
JUDGE BELCHER.
Plaintiff Rests Its Case and the De
fense Has Opened Its Side of
the Contest.
The suit of the City and County of San
Francisco against Augustus C. Widber
and the Fidelity and Deposit Company of
Maryland commenced before Judge Bel
cher yesterday. By the suit the city and
county seeks to recover $118,536 97, the
amount of Widber's defalcation while
holding the office of Treasurer, The in
terests of the plaintiff are in the hands of
Garret McEnerney and City and County
Attorney Harry T. Creswell; Widber is
represented by Edgar Peixotto, and C. H.
Wilson and Morrison & Cope are caring
for the cause of the defendant corpora
tion, which is liable to the extent of $100,
000 as surety on Widber's bond.
The case of the city and county is well
known and rests solely on the fact that
one of its agents, Widber, embezzled
funds from the treasury, and the city
seeks to recover from the defaulter per
sonally and from his surety. The princi
pal points set up by the Surety Company
in its answer are that Widber owns suffi
cient property to make good the amount
of his defalcation, and that the Mayor,
the Auditor and the Superior Court neg
lected to count the money in the treasury
as required by law. The answer contends
that the officials named "wholly failed
and neglected to meet togetner every
month or at all during said time and see
and count the moneys remaining in the
hands of said Widher." It is then alleged
that had the officials properly attended to
their duty the fact that Widber was a de
faulter would have been discovered in the
month of December, l&W.
Mathew de la Montanya. I. W. Lees, "W.
P. Sullivan Jr., John Broderick and Chris
tian Reis, the present Treasurer, were
called by the plaintiff. Their testimony
simply related to the discovery of the
shortage in Widber's accounts and the
subsequent counting of the funds remain
ing in the treasury. The plaintiff doubt
less established the fact that there was a
shortage for the amount sued for and
that it was taken by Widber, and after
this was done rested its case.
Auditor Broderick and Mayor Phelan
were then placed on the stand. Both told
the same story as to how the money in
the treasury was counted at the latter
part of last March, the month in which it
is believed Widber made away with most
or the missing money. Mayor Phelan
testified that he examined personally the
treasury tags on the sacks, weighed
throe and counted the gold in one. As the
tags were apparently intact h' did not
weigh them all. Whether the court will
find that the neglect to count all the
money, and thereby sooner discover the
defalcation, releases the Surety Company
from responsibility remains to be seen, but
its representatives are confident that no
judgment against their client will be
given.
SANITATION OF
CAMP MERRITT
HEALTH BOARD TO LEARN
THEIR POWERS.
Explanations of Faulty Plumbing in
the Ferry Building â A Chance
for Medical Students.
The Board of Health busied itself with
a variety of camp affairs yesterday, and
in the end it was left to Garret McEner
ney, the board's attorney, to determine
Just what power the board * has over
troops in the country's service. The
board has had inspected the food for the
camp and the sanitation of the camp
grounds, but there are several things
which it wishes further to correct, and
what its powers are in the premises will
be decided by Mr. McEnerney.
Professor "Wenzell was granted a leave
of absence and his salary was raised to
$100 a month. While he is away H. A.
Gould will take his place.
A communication from Edward Swain,
architect of the ferry building, in which
he answered the criticisms of the plumb
ing inspector of the board, was read.
The objections of the plumbing in
spector were directed mainly to the
fact that little or no care had been
taken to ' insure proper ventilation,
that the gutter pipes were not of
the proper material and that there were
no sewer connections. The architect ex
plained that the water of the bay ebbed
and flowed beneath the building, and that
all below the lower floor was open. He
said all waste pipes were led directly to
the lower floor, and from there they
emptied into the bay. There was no need
of sewer connections, he wrote, and the
only gases which could accumulate under
the building were the natural gases aris
ing from the salt water.
The board notified the architect that it
would not press the objections made.
Food Inspector Dockery reported that
he had bought several lots of strawber
ries in open market, and he had submit
ted them to the cnemist of the board. He
recommended that the previous action of
the board prohibiting the use of straw
berry boxes more than once be continued
in force.
Dr. Henry Masten Fine was appointed
an interne at the City and County Hospi

DEATH BY
FIRE AFTER
A DEBAUCH
John Archie McDonald
Fatally Burned.
HE HAD DRUNK TOO MUCH
RODGERS JUMPED OUT OF A
THIRD-STORY WINDOW.
Exciting and Destructive Fire Early
Yesterday Morning in the
Union Hotel,
Potrero.
The overturning of a coal oil lamp by a
drunken man in a hotel at an early hour
yesterday morning caused his death, the
serious Injury of another man and the
loss of about $4000 worth of property.
Sergeant Conboy was passing the cor
ner of Twentieth and Michigan streets,
Potrero, about 2:30 o'clock yesterday
morning when he noticed flames issuing
from the top story of the Union Hotel,
212-214 Michigan street. He met Police
man Kelly and instructed him to turn in
an alarm of flre. At the same time he
was joined by Policeman Felix Dough
erty, and together they ran to the hotel
and blew their whistles and hammered
on the front door to awake the occu
pants.
v Then they battered in the front door,
and aided by Kelly did splendid work in
rescuing the lodgers, about fifty in num
ber, who were apparently bewildered by
the smoke and being so unceremoniously
awakened from their slumbers. William
Rodgers, who: was aroused jg from his
slumbers by the smoke in his bedroom,
opened his window and jumped to the
ground, a distance of over 30 feet. His
window opened into a small space divid
ing the hotel from the adjoining building.
Conboy and Dougherty saw him lying on
the ground, and being airaid that he
would be killed by tailing debris they
hurried to resuce him, but got confused
in the labyrinth of passages. They fortu
nately came across one of the waitresses
in the dining room, and she conducted
them to where Rodger* was lying. They
carried him to a place of safety? and he
was later removed to the City and County
Hospital, where it was found "that he was
suffering from a sprain of the back

which the lamp was placed, overturning
both lamp and table. He attempted to
stamp out the flames,- which immediately
blazed up, and, failing, staggered into the
hallway with, his nightshirt on J fire. - It
was then that he was discovered by En
gineer McClusky.
McDonald was a man about 60 years of
age. He had been separated from his
wife and family for some time and recent
ly he was brought before the late Judge
Campbell on a charge of failure to pro
vide. The Judge ordered him to pay $20
per month, and it is said that when he
heard of the Judge's death he made use of
language that was far from complimen
tary and announced that he would pay
alimony to his wife just when he felt in
clined. He leaves a widow and six chil
dren, the two eldest boys being employed
in the Union Iron Works.
The building was owned by -Eliza
Schultze and was occupied by W. and J.
B. Johnstone. The loss on tii- 1 buil< is
estimated at $2500 and on contents $1500.
The Railroad Sued Again.
A suit was filed yesterday afternoon In
the United States Circuit Court on behalf
of the United States Government repre
sented by Attorney General John W.
Griggs, United States Attorney H. S.
Foote and Assistant United States Attor
ney Samuel Knight, against the Central
Pacific and the Southern Pacific Com
pany to recover $17,989 75, the value at
$2 50 per acre of 7195.15 acres of land along
the line of the Central Pacific Company
north of Sacramento to the State line.
The complaint alleges that the land was
patented by the Government to the rail
road company by mistake, and that the
company afterward sold a portion of it
to settlers who were innocent purchasers.
As Congress has passed an act to protect
these purchasers the Government has
confirmed their title to the lands, and
now sues the railroad company for the
amount stated.
An American Yacht Lost.
The American yacht Tolna, the property
of Count Festetics, has been changed
from American to Austrfan registry. The
yacht has been for some time in Asiatic
waters, flying the American flag, on the
various pleasure excursions being made
by the Count. The outbreak of the war
between Spain and the United States has
made the Count apprehensive that his
yacht might be seized by a Spanish
cruiser or privateer, and he accordlngly
changed the registry of his vessel to the
flag of Austria, which country being a
non-combatant, will not have the honor
of thrashing the Spaniards.
Lives by Blackmail.
Frank Pavella, who makes his living by
insulting and blackmailing innocent girls,
was sent to the County Jail for three
months hy Judge Conlan yesterday. He
was arrested Monday night by Policeman
McGee, on Clementina street, alter trying
his old tricks on a family there. He" has
been out of jail only six weeks.AWAY TO THE WEST ON WEDNESDAY
The First Nebraska Regiment,
Colonel Bratt commanding, will leave
with the next expedition for Manila.
At a late hour last night Major-Gen
eral Otis telegraphed the adjutant
general at Washington, D. C. and in
formed him that the Nebraska Regi
ment, eighty-one men strong to the
compnny, would be sent to the Phil
ippines. General Otis also asked for
information regarding the detention
here of some of the officers of the
regiment lor the purpose of recruit
ing the regiment up to 106 men to
the company. He also asked for simi
lar advice regarding the recruiting
of the First Colorado up to the maxi
mum strength.
It has been an open secret for sev
eral days that Colonel Bratt had
something up his sleeve, for he has
been in constant communication with
division headquarters, and late last
night he had a long conference with
General Otis.
It is also certain that another de- !
tachment of troops, less than a regi
ment, will sail with the expedition
on next Wednesday, and the informa
tion is imparted that in all proba
bility it will be the two Idaho bat
tanons under the command of Colo
nel Jones. These troops have been
inspected by Colonel Hughes and
Captain Mallory and are thoroughly
equipped. It is also rumored that af
ter all the corps of engineers will be
included in the expedition.
The Fifty-first lowa Regiment which [
started from Council Bluffs in three !
sections is strung out along 1 the road.
The rim section was scheduled to reach
Sacramento last nisht and there await

Tr;e Steamers Senator, City of Puebla and Otyo, Laden With Troops, Will Follow th>e China, Colon
and Zealandia to Manila.
THE work of getting the transports
Zealandia, China and Colon ready
for sea is rapidly progressing, and
if nothing unforeseen happens they
will proceed to Manila, via Honolulu, next
Monday. The China and Colon are coaled,
and the putting in of the stores began
yesterday. The Chinese passengers who
were detained on the China have been
transferred to the Belgic and the space
they occupied has now been filled with
bunks for the soldiers.
In regard to the coal passers and fire
men on the China there 1b a treat rum
pus. Able-bodied Americans and experts
at the work are more than willing to ship
for the voyage, but they assert that
"lieutenant" Schwerin Is so enamored of
the Chinese- that he Is actually paying
them double wages to make the voyage
to Manila and back. Through the boat-
Bwain, who is a Mongol, the autocrat of
the Mail Company harangued the coolies
and asked them not to have the ship. He
pointed out to them that the war In Ma
nila was practically over as far as sea
fighting was concerned and that the trip
would be Just as pleasant as the voyage
to Hongkong. The Mongolians held a
pow-wow at which the boatswain expa
tiated upon the extra pay, and the coolies

been announced by the railroad .com- \
pany. The regiment will Join the an

THE NEXT EXPEDITION.
Officers at Camp Merritt Pre
dict That the Fleet Will
Sail Next Monday.
As published exclusively in The Call of
Tuesday It now seems an assured fact
that the next expedition to Manila
will sail from this port early next week.
The information comes from a prominent
officer at Camp Merritt that everything
except the vessels Is in readiness, and
that on Sunday the troops will go aboard
the transports and anchor will be weighed
on Mpnday morning. It appears that the
China has been the cause of the delay.
On the vessel's last trip over she brought
among her passengers a number of China
man and the military authorities at a
recent meeting held at army headquar
ters deemed It best that the vessel should
first be thoroughly disinfected before al
lowing troops to go aboard.
Camp Merritt was thoroughly policed
yesterday by a large body of prisoners.
As a result of theljr close proximity to
llcjuor and a surplus Bupply of cash the
guard houses of the . Eighteenth and
Twenty-third were unusually full. A de
tail from each regiment was ordered to
r- DOrt at division headquarters, from
which point they began their work under
the watchful eye of h strong guard.
Q H Penrose, acting assistant surgeon,
ISA and formerly surgeon general of
the National Guard of Utah has been
i ttacbed to the Utah Light Artillery, with
f first lieutenant. 110 reported
; tain young yesterday and was as
sii^ned to duty. .
The I'tah troop of cavalry and the
ri, California Regiment were vac
ted yesterday.
Private Miles, Company E. Thirteenth
Minnesota, was taken to the field hos
pital yesterday. He has pneumonia.
Harry "H Sergeant, Tenth Pennsylvania,
a ii. phew of Colonel Hawkins, who has
had an attack of appendicitis, will be
discharged from the regiment, as It has
been found that he will have to submit
to an operation. _
CaDteln F. E. Buchan, Twentieth Kan
sas, has been appointed by Colonel Little
acting regimental adjutant in the place of
Adjutant Deford, who has returned to
Kansas on recruiting service.
The Seventh California was inspected in
heavy marching ordor yesterday by Colo
nel Hughes and Captain Mallorv. Captain
D. C. Williams, who was appointed quar
termaster of the Seventh California, in
the place of Captain Klmhall. ordered to
General Merriam's headquarters, reported
for duty yesterday to Colonel Berry.
General M. P. Miller, commanding the
First Brigade, issued an order yesterday
to the effect that all recruits were to drill
not loss than four hours each day, and
old soldiers not less than three hours.
GEN. GREENE AT WORK.
He Has Inspected His Brigade
and Instituted Target
Practice.
Brigadier-General Greene, who will
command the next expedition of troops
leaving this port, is a soldier from the
crown of his head to soles of his feet.
Yes, even' Inch of him breathes of mili
tary experience, and while he is a Mar
tinet, simply because he can't be anything
else, yet at the same time his rank does
not weigh so heavily upon him that he
forgets the natural courtesy of a gentle
man. As far as giving out anything to
the press is concerned, he is not different
from other officers of high rank, but
whenever a newspaper representative
calls at his quarters he is courteously re
ceived and quietly but politely informed
that there is nothing fur publication. In
this respect there is a marked difference
between General Greene and some other
officers who wear the stars.
Cm Tuesday Genera! Greene inspected
the First Battalion of the Twenty-third
Infantry and yesterday he Inspected the
First Battalion of the Eighteenth Infan
try. These two battalions will strike
camp to-day and move thHr tents to the
encampment just opposite Major-General
Otis' headquarters. This Is done for the
purpose of making room in the Eigh
teenth and Twenty-third for the new re
cruits thai are expected to-morrow, and
also for the purpose of consolidating the
two battalions. Tin- battalions will in
their now camp bo under the command of
Lieutenant-Colonel Bailey of the Eigh
teenth.
General Greene had the First Colorado
finally decided, much to Schwerin's de
light, that they would stay by the ship.
The autocrat of the Mail Company then
returned to the waiting men who wanted
to ship as coal passers and firemen and
told them that no more men wore wanted.
The steamers City of Peking, City of
Sydney and Australia went out with an
entire European crew. When it came to
shipping the crew of the Peking the Chi
nese were removed and Americans put in
their places. The Colon an<T Zealandia
will also go out with white crews, but the
boys who sail on the China will be waited
on by Mongols, and the coal passing and
firing will be done by a race which Uncle
Sam excludes from his country for his
country's good. This, too. in spite of the
fact that "Lieutenant" Schwerln can get
strapping Americans to do the work at
the usual rate of mages.
The transports now nearly ready to sail
will be barely out of the bay before three
other 6teamers will be well on the way
toward being in condition to follow them.
The next fleet to sail will be the coast de
fense steamer Monadnock, accompanied"
by the recently purchased steamer Whit
gift, the cruiser Philadelphia and the
steamers Senator, City of Puebla and
Ohio. The work of getting the Senator
and Tenth Pennsylvania over at the Pre
sidio range yesterday morning at target
practice. The two regiments will con
tinue the practice every day as long as
they are here. The men who have had
the least experience will be given the
most attention. General Greene la look
ing after every detail connected with the
THE NEXT EXPEDITION WILL SAIL
EITHER ON TUESDAY OR WEDNESDAY.
At the headquarters of the Department of the Pacific,
Major General Merritt commanding, the information was
given yesterday for publication that the next expedition for
the Philippine Islands will sail from this port next Tuesday or
Wednesday. It was said by the commanding general that
the fleet would consist of the Zealandia, China, Colon, Sen
ator and Morgan City. It is believed that the troops will go
aboard the ships Monday and Tuesday, and that the vessels
will leave on Wednesday, June 15.
Since it is definitely announced that the squadron has
been increased from three to five ships there is much conjec
ture among officers of the command as to what troops in addi
tion to the organizations already designated will be ordered
to join the expedition. The Morgan City and Senator will
be able to accommodate about 1500 men. A regiment and
one battalion may be added to the forces already under or
ders.
Leading officers of the Seventh California are confident
that this regiment will be selected. The Minnesota and Ne
braska troops are equally confident that they will be added to
the expeditionary forces. There is a strong probability that
two batteries of regular artillery may be designated.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JUNE 9, 1898.
CALIFORNIA TROOPS.
Recruits for the First Regimentâ Status of
the National Guard.
Advices by wire were received yesterday from the Secretary of War by
General Men-lam, commanding the Department of California, and Adjutant
General Barrett of the State forces, that Captain Carrington, U. S. A., has
been detailed to the duty of mustering in a sufficient number of recruits
to fill the First California Volunteer Regiment of Infantry to the maximum.
Three hundred recruits will be required to fill up the regiment.
Governor Budd and Adjutant General Barrett desire that active members
of the National Guard and ex-Guardsmen shall have the first opportunity
to enlist. The recruits when enrolled will be sent forward to join the regi
ment at Manila. To-day or to-morrow a recruiting station will be estab
tablished in the armory, corner of Page and Gough streets, where applica
tions for enlistment may be made. In a short time mustering officers will
be designated to muster in recruits for the Sixth and Seventh Regiments of
California Volunteer Infantry.
It Is now understood that Governor Budd, In the light of an opinion by
the Attorney General, may either reorganize the National Guard by enroll
ing men to fill the vacancies caused by the enlistment of volunteers in the
United States service or maintain the existing organization by simply giv
ing a leave of absence to every man of the guard now serving in the or
ganizations which have been accepted by the United States.
It is quite likely that the plan of granting leave of absence will be fol
lowed. That course has been pursued by the National Guard of Ohio, Mas
sachusetts and New York, and seems to be eminently fair and proper. It
is contended that soldiers leaving the State to uphold the flag at the front
ought not to be deprived of any of the rights and privileges which member
ship in the National Guard confers. Again, it is estimated that the train
ing which the volunteers are bound to receive in active service will be of
immense advantage to the Guard when the volunteers return from the war
and rejoin their old organizations.
brigade that he will command; In fact,
not the smallest thing escapes his notice.
TRANSPORTS FOR MANILA.
The War Department Is at
Last Vigorously at Work in
Securing Steamships.
The delay on the part of the War De-
ready began yesterday, and as soon aa
the Ohio gets in from Seattle, which will
probably be to-morrow, she will also be
overhauled. Nothing has, as yet, been
done to. the Puebla, as her owners have
asked the Government for permission to
make one more trip with her. If the re
quest be granted the chances are that the
Indiana, now on Puget Soumt, will take
the Puebla's place in the fleet.
The Puebla and the Senator will be flt
ted with the Turner bunk and the sol
diers' quarters will be on a similar scale
to those on the Australia and Zealandia,
The Senator is a new vessel and will
make, a model troop ship. She is a good
seaboat, a splendid carrier and a good
fourteen-knot vessel. The Puebla has
been for years the fastest steamer on the
coast, and out of the tens of thousands of
people who have traveled on her there
will not be found one who has not a good
word for the Pacific Coast Steamship
Company's crack steamer. The Ohio
came from the East to go into the Klon
dike trade, and she has been fitted out to
carry passengers to Seattle. She is not
nearly so fast as the Senator and Puebla,
so the entire fleet will have to regulate
its speed by hers.
When the third fleet has been dls
partment In furnishing a sufficient num
ber of transport? for the prompt convey
ance of the Philippine expeditionary
forces to Manila has been a source of
much vexation to Major General Merrivt,
who is very anxious to get the whole
army of 20,000 men to the scene of action
at as early a day ns possible. He recent
ly laid before the War Department the
necessity of more prompt action in the
matter of furnishing transports. The re
sult is that tho department is now exert
ing itself very vigorously to secure every
available vessel on the Pacific Coast for
the transportation of the Philippine expe
ditionary forces.
Yesterday afternoon the medical exam
ining board, consisting of Army Surgeons
patched a fourth one will l>e well under
way. It will probably be composed of the
Morgan City, Indiana or Puebla and the
City of Para or Alameda. most likely the
latter. Some of these vessels could be got
ready to leave for Manila in shf>rt order,
but the Government will not be ready.'
The men are here, but their equipments
are not to the fore, and until they are
nothing can be done. Iri any -?vent it is
pretty safe to say that, over and above
the men who sailed on the Australia
Peking and Sydney, ten thousand troops
will he on their way to Manila before the
month is out.
Of the vessels scheduled to leave in the
near future the Zealandla will carry about
900, the China about GOO, the Colon 750
Senator 750. Ohio 750, Puebla 750, Indiana
750 and Morgan City GOO soldiers. A num
ber of vessels mentioned In the dispatches
from the East are not available, for the
simple reason that there is no means of
transferring coai from the hold to the
bunkers at mb. The Queen and Santa
Rosa are both In this fix, as are also the
UmatiUa and Walla Walla.. Other vessels
mentioned In the Washington dispatches
are not In port, and some of them will
not be available until somÂ» of th<- trans
ports that have already sailed return from
.Manila.
White. Crosby and Morris, who inspected
the China. Colon and Zealand!* was or
dered to examine the steamships Senator
and Morgan City, now in this port as to
their capacity, sanitary condition and
needed changes. If these steamers are
found acceptable they will be chartered
as transports. The board began its work
yesterday afternoon. The Indiana and
Ohio, formerly Atlantic liners and part of
the Empire Steamship Company's fleet
recently sent around to this coast to en
gage In the Alaska trade, are expected
here any day from Puget Sound Upon
their arrival they will be Immediately In
spected by the medical examining board.
The steamship Belgic, which arrived
here yesterday from the Orient, will prob
ably be chartered by the Government, and
also the big Alaska excursion steamer
The Queen, running from Seattle to Ju
neau, and owned by the Pacific Coast
Steamship Company, although it Is
claimed that she will not answer the pur
pose of a transport for so long a dis
tance as that from San Francisco to Ma
nila, 4000 miles.
FUN FOR THE SOLDIERS.
Direful Tales of Famine Poured
Into Willing Ears by Prac
tical Jokers.
The soldiers at Camp Merrltt do not
take kindly to their commanding officers'
restrictions on the Indiscriminate distri
bution of pies, cakes and fruits by sympa
thetic citizens, and resort to various ex
pedients to secure contributions of pas
try to "top off" the Government rations.
The plan most In vogue is for a squad to
line up against the fence, and when a
group of ladies pass begin a narration
of famine and general ill treatment that
immediately enlists the sympathies of
the passers-by.
In nine cases out of ten they will stop
and question the boys, and then such
tales of neglect and abuse by an ungrate
ful Government are poured forth that the
very hearts of the hearers are wrung by
the recital. Each wearer of the blue
spreaus himself to outdo the others in
the matter of hard-luck yarns, and soon
the horrified bevy of beauties are scud
ding for the nearest, lunch counter, re
turning in short order with all the sweets
in the place.
The "God bless you, ladies," that greet
their return 'is as music to their souls,
and they move on through the camp with
the consciousness that they have proven
Samaritans to at least c few of the poor
fellows.
When they are out of sight the fun
commences. May be the successful men
dicants will take a bite or two out of a
nice juicy pie and utilize the remainder to j
ornament the rear expansion of some
luckless comrade who happens to have
his back exposed for a target. If the
guard tent happens to have any occu
pants a generous supply of the forage |
is passed into them through the venti- i
lator, as a rule, and at cannonball speed. 'â 
This is one of the favorite amusements
for the boys when off duty and not al- j
lowed to leave camp. Their portrayals
of scanty rations, ill-cooked and of poor- j
est quality, are certain to excite the at- |
tentlon and pity of the gentler sex. and j
the man who can spin the most doleful
yarn, keeping furthest from the truth, is
envied by all his comrades.
One young lady who visited the camp I
last Sunday was so worked upon that j
she emptied her purse for pies for a :
crowd of giant Montanans, whose very
proportions gave the lie to their stories ;
of starvation. The usual "God bless :
yous" so played upon her heartstrings j
that she took the first car for home, un- ,
able longer to endure the sight of such
sufferings among the country's defend-
ers.
On her way downtown she questioned
a young soldier, a member of the Utah
Cavalry troop, and he proved to be a
prince of romancers. His tale was to the
effect that the only reason the members
of his troop had not died of starvation
was because the citizens of Utah had
thoughtfully subscribed $2500 to be used
for their comfort in Manila, but this fund
had already been heavily drawn upon to
keep the wolf from their tents. Thoir
horsf-s, though, according to the young
Mormon, had been without fodder for
several days, until finally the men had to
go downtown and buy hay at $27 a ton,
with their own money, to keep the ani
mals from starving.
This last portrayal of suffering nearly
broke the 'lady's heart, and upon reach-
Ing home she had her escort write a
statement to The Call of what she had
seen ;ui<l heard, with the request that an
Investigation be held.
The matter has been thoroughly looked
into, with the result that it is apparent
the lady has been made, the victim of a
lot of conscienceless jokers.
CHANCE FOR OPERATORS.
United Stat s Signal Corps Will
Run the Philippine Tele
graph System.
The Tnlted States Signal Corps now be
ing organized by Major R. E. Thompson
to accompany the Philippine expedition
ary forces will take charge of all tele
graph lines in the conquered territory as
rapidly as circumstances will permit. A
large number of expert telegraph opera
tors will be neoded. and it seems that it
is a very difficult thing to find enough
good telegraphers In San Francisco or
vicinity who are desirous of enlisting, al
though the pay is more than that 01 any
other branch of the military service.
When the Signal Corps recruiting office
was opened there was room for one hun
dred operators in the organization, yet
up to date not more than twenty have
been secured. The consequence is that
Major Thompson will be obliged to draw
on the Eastern cities in order to iill the
quota. He received a telegram yesterday
that two first class operators are on the
way here from North Carolina. The term
of enlistment is for the war. and upon its
conclusion the entire telegraph system of
the Philippines will be in the hanus of the
Americans. It will be seen that eventu
ally vt-ry good positions will be open for
the right kind of men. It is an opportu
nity that should not be overlooked. In
all probability all operators now enlisting
will be retained in Government employ
ment after peace shall have been de
clared.
Yesterday afternoon Sergeant Watklns.
Corporal Strachauer and Privates Philip
and Strachan of the Signal Corps of the
National Guard of California, in which
organization they nave served for some
time at Sacramento, enlisted In the I'nlt
ed States Signal Corps. They are bright
young men, of good character, and will
prove a most desirable acquisition.
Quite a number of transfers are being
made from the troops now here to the
Signal Corps, but the great demand is for
telegraph operators.

Professor Giddings' importnnt intro-

illustrations, taken from various coun
tries and ages, si ow that the difficulty of
maintaining absoiute rectitude in public
affairs equals that of the rich man in his
efforts to enter the kingdom of heaven.
But, on the other hand, his ultimate con-
clusion is that, as the art of governing is
one of the most noble, so the actual exer-
cise of the art is compatible with the
loftiest standard of integrity."

GIVING THE NEWS.
IN its career as a newspaper The Call has avoided
the habit of boasting. Sometimes there has arisen
a necessity for exposing the idle claims of some
so-called rival, but ordinarily this paper prefers to go
on its way, letting the people judge it by its merits.
Now it feels that in all modesty and justice it may
direct attention to itself.
Yesterday morning the papers of this city appeared
with accounts of the battle of Manila. These ac
counts were not new. True, they were by eye-wit- i
nesses, but weeks ago The Call had published a story |
by an eye-witness, a man who had stood on the bridge â 
of the CMympia with Dewey, had taken notes during
the hottest of the fighting, and when the clouds of i
smoke lifted snapshots at the shifting scenes. The
story had then been beautifully and artistically set
forth, cabled to The Call, and was the first authentic
account of the triumph of Dewey's fleet. The ac
count was printed, and appreciated. So decisive a
journalistic victory was it that a yellow contemporary,
rather than have nothing to balance it, printed a fake
story made up from the vagrant notes of a man who ;
was there as the correspondent of a Chicago daily,
and on a non-combatant ship.
Note the sequel. Three men arrive in this port
fresh from Manila. Two of them have a story to sell.
the same old story, less well told than The Call had
already told it. They open negotiations, and one of
them is asked if during the fight he had observed a
correspondent named Stickney.
"Did I observe him?" he answers. "The coolest
man in the engagement."
"Well," he is informed, "Stickney was there for The
Call."
"Oh," he replies, "if you have Stickney's story there
is nothing more we can tell you."
So the other papers bought the peddled yarns, not
having had the truth before, and The Call kept on
about its business of presenting news. One of its
anxious contemporaries devoted a page to a voyage
to Honolulu â a voyage neither more exciting nor un
usual than a trip to Oakland â while to the old,
familiar tale of Manila it gave two pages. Yet neither
of them published the important news that there had
been a fight between the Spanish and the insurgents
at the Philippine capital, and that about the gates of
the city the bodies of the dead were strewn. Why
did they overlook this ?
The answer is easy. They were ready to print such
matter as might be brought to them, regardless of its
age. They were not willing to reach out aftfr real
news. They did not have a correspondent "on the
spot." They were content to print stale information
and try to make the public think it new.
This is only one of many instances in which The
Call has had to blaze the way for its slower contem
poraries. It does so willingly. It does not begrudge
them the honor of following a good example. But
when they follow it so far in the rear, and with a blare
of trumpets announce themselves at the head of the
procession, conscience compels us to file a demurrer.
They are at one end of the procession, but it is not the
head.
Spain has been congratulating herself upon the
achievements at Santiago in the same warm fashion
which sheadopted after the splendid victory she did not
get at Manila. She has the glorious optimism of the in
dividual who, in describing a scrimmage in which he
had participated, said of his antagonist: "I was too
much for him. I got my hair in his hands and my
nose between his teeth, and the fight had to end."
Spain has granted "unlimited" powers to the bom
bastic Governor of the Philippines, a circumst?nce
showing unwarranted confidence both in the Gov
ernor and her own ability. The time when Spain
had authority to set any limits expired more than a
month ago.
If the American troops find the insurgent leader
established as dictator in the Philippines General
Merritt will have a problem to deal with of which the
Government does not seem to have taken account.
When the daughter of General Grant is to marry
a Confederate soldier the necessity for remarking that
the war is over has vanished so completely that not
even a campaign orator will have the nerve to use it.
When Spain shall have lost Cuba, Porto Rico and
the Philippines there is no reason to doubt that it will
continue to make a show of rejoicing over its tri
umphs. Spain seems to need a keeper.
Sampson, Schley and Dewey are all alike in respect
of having no time to waste on words. They are about
as reticent a trio as ever had control of the business
end of a cable.

ANNEXATION AND THE SUGOR TRUST.
T"HE Post says that "the sugar trust desires cheap
raw sugar. * * Place the Hawaiian Islands
in the same relation to the United States as
other foreign countries and the raw sugar product
of the islands would contribute to cheapen the raw
material, but by reason of the $39 per ton protection
would not endanger the domestic price of the refined
article. For this reason the sugar trust opposes an
nexation of the islands."
This is in answer to our request for a statement of
any reason for the repeated declaration that the sugar
trust opposes annexation.
Hawaiian raw sugar now comes to this country free
of duty, under the reciprocity treaty. If the islands
were placed in the same relation to us as other coun
tries, then raw sugar would pay a duty of $19 per
ton. Perhaps the Post can tell how this increase in
its cost would make it cheaper to the sugar trust.
That association of refiners gets it now free of duty.
If the islands are annexed it will still be free of duty.
If the reciprocity treaty is abrogated it will cost $19
a ton more than now. It is true that annexation of
the islands would abolish the $39 per ton differential
duty on refined sugar, which would mean only the
transfer by the sugar trust of the business of refining
to the islands, provided the much cheaper labor there
would offset increased cost of fuel and other inci
dents of the refining business.
It will be seen that the sugar trust, then, has no
interest against annexation, and would probably be
more helped than hurt by it.
The Post's article is really an argument against the
differential duty on sugar. It is intended to show
that the duty of $19 'per ton on raw sugar is not*
enough protection to American raw cane and beet
sugars, while $39 per ton on refined sugar is too much
protection. That is a legitimate and proper subject
of discussion. The Democratic Wilson tariff of 1894
gave a differential of 40 per cent ad valorem and
one-eighth of a cent a pound in favor of refined supar.
The real sum of the differential was the difference be
tween that and the 40 per cent ad valorem placed on
raw sugar. The differential in the Wilson bill may
have been too low and that in the Dingley bill may
be too high, but that has nothing to do with the an
nexation of Hawaii. There is involved a large sugar
interest, but it is represented by the island planters,
who fear the impermanence of the reciprocity treaty
and who seek therefore to secure the benefit of $19
a ton protection on their raw sugar by annexation, j
The interest antagonistic to them is represented by
the American producers of raw cane and beet sugars,
who have to pay their labor the white scale of wages,
while the Hawaiian planters pay the yellow scale of
wages. To the Hawaiian planter, with cheap labor, 1
protection of $19 a ton means $38, because his labor
cost of production is only half the cost to the Ameri
can planter.
The sweetening in the annexation issue is exclu
sively at the Hawaiian end of it, and the attempt is
made to lure American planters and American labor
by an appeal to prejudice against the American sugar
trust.
THE COMING CZAR MAYOR.
THERE seems to be a general misapprehension
on the part of the people and the politicians as
to the time for taking effect of the new charter.
The idea which prevails is that the Mayor to be
elected in November will in some way or another
turn out as the potentate created by the instrument.
Great preparations are being made for the ensuing
mayoralty campaign in consequence, and in all dis
cussions which cover municipal politics the question
who is or who is not to be a candidate for Mayor
this ye;ir is uppermost.
As a matter of fact, however, the new charter Mayor
will not appear upon the scene until December, 1899.
The instrument will come before the Legislature in
January next for ratification, and if ratified it will go
into effect for all purposes, except as to the Mayor's
appointments, immediately. A municipal election in
1899 is provided for. In that year the Board of Elec
tion Commissioners elected in November next will
carry on registration and do all the things which they
are now authorized to do by law. At the election in
November. 1899, all the officials to be chosen by the
people under the new charter will then be chosen,
but for the purpose of making the appointments con
ferred upon the Mayor by the instrument, and as to
the qualifications of the persons so appointed, the
charter does not go into operation until the Ist day
of December, 1899.
The effect of this is to postpone the creation of a
Lord Mayor until the second election. In other
words, the Mayor elected in November this year will
serve under the consolidation act but one year, and
the terms of all the officers chosen this year will be
shortened â the four year officers by three years, and
the two year officers by one year. The Mayor chosen
in JB9B will have nothing whatever to do under the
new charter. The Mayor chosen in 1899, however,
will make his appointments in December of that
year and with the officials so appointed enter upon
the administration of the government on the Ist of
January, 1900.
Except as a stepping-stone to greater powers, there
fore, the election of a Mayor this year will be insig
nificant. Perhaps the individual chosen may do
something during his short term to improve his
chances for the more important office, but otherwise
he will be simply Mayor under the consolidation act
for one yeai.
SPRINGING TriE TROP.
THE War Department as a matter of course
keeps its own counsel. It does not issue bulle
tins announcing what it intends to do. It is there
j fore not possible to declare positively what will be
'â  the course of action during the present week, but all
I signs point to the conclusion thru our army will make
the descent upon Cuba in force and that the trap
which has long been prepared for the Spaniards on
the island will be sprung and the prey seized.
With Cervera blocked in the bay at Santiago, and
i the much talked of Cadiz fleet still on the other side
i of the ocean, there is no apparent reason why the
; army assembled at Tampa and other Gulf ports should
I not go forward at once. We may reasonably look for
! a forward movement along the whole line. The
! week therefore will probably be an exciting one, and
' possibly the most critical of the war.
It is no longer questionable that we can at any time
our military authorities deem advisable take posses
sion of Porto Rico and so closely invest Havana as
to render Cuba virtually ours. Cervera can do noth
ing to help Blanco and Blanco can do as little to as
sist Cervera. They are effectually separated and shut
off from each other. Our forces can assail them in
detail if they choose or attack both at the same time,
for we are strong enough to make the double assault
with safety and success.
If we were in conflict with any other nation than
Spain this situation of the checkerboard of war
would imply a speedy close to the contest. We are
masters of all the strategic points and have over
whelming forces in every place where thjre is a pos
sibility of battle. Spain can do nothing but make a

hopeless, sullen struggle against certain defeat. She
possesses, however, just the kind of people who are
likely to make that kind of a struggle. Recognizing
that her colonial possessions are irretrievably lost,
and that the chances of every battle will be against
her, she is still capable of fighting for the mere gratifi
cation of hatred until we send a fleet to her coasts
and possibly until we land an army on her soil.
If the descent upon the islands is made in force it
is safe to say that from that time forward the war will
be carried on with swift aggressiveness. The rainy
season has begun in the West Indies and the hot
summer is at hand. It would never do to leave our
soldiers lingering at this season either in Cuba or in
Porto Rico for any length of time. It would be an
economy of life to make the fighting short and sharp
and to assail the enemy in his lines as rapidly as we
could come at them. It is this condition of affairs
that makes the week critical and gives a thrilling
interest to every item of news from the front. We
are evidently on the eve of battles, and the decisive
action of the war may occur at any time.
THE POLICE AND THE POOLROOMS
AT the meeting of the directors of the Merchants'
Association on Tuesday there was read a com
munication from Chief of Police Lees inclos
ing reports from Captains Wittman and Spillane
to the effect that no poolrooms selling pools on
horse-racing exist in this city, they being now situated
at Oceanside, San Mateo County, and Sausalito,
Marin County, where they have licenses and arc sell
ing pools on Eastern races.
The statements of the communication are gratify
ing. When The Call began its crusade against the
poolrooms it was met by the assertion that the law
was defective and that the police could not suppress
the evil. When The Call by insistent urging induced
the police to make an effort to suppress the rooms
it was found that even where law was good enough
a* second objection presented itself. The juries would
not convict. On that ground the police again ceased
to act, and once more the crusade had to be under
taken and fought from the start.
Each of the objections assigned by the police
authorities for their failure to put an end to the traffic
of the illicit poolrooms was to a certain extent valid.
The law is so complex in its provisions that it is diffi
cult to obtain convictions under it. Also several ac
cused partes charged with violating the law were ac
quitted under circumstances which justified the fear
that Police Court juries were prejudiced against it
and would not bring in verdicts of conviction.
Against all these obstacles, however, The Call was
sanguine that victory could be obtained if the fight
was kept up with vigor and tireless persistence. It be
gan anew the crusade and published the facts about the
poolrooms. It exposed the temptations the managers
in such rooms put in the way of boys and of women.
The full extent of the scandal and the shame
of the trade were made known. Then the
Merchants' Association joined with The Call and
gave its potent help in the fight for law
against the corrupt forces that defiantly violated it
without even a pretense at concealment.
From the reports inclosed in the communication of
the Chief of Police to the Merchants' Association it
appears that victory has been accomplished at last.
The law has been enforced and for the present at any
rate it seems there are no poolrooms run openly in
Jhis city. The illicit pool-sellers have removed to
other counties, and it is for the authorities of those
localities to deal with them. Now it remains to be
seen how long we can keep the city free from the evil
it has taken such a long fight to suppress.
The Merchants' Association should not lose sight
of the subject now that it has helped to build up that
resolute public opinion which has so effectively aided
the police in maintaining the law. The pool-sellers
will come back as soon as they think the storm has
blown over. Vigilance on ihepart of the police and the
Merchants' Association, as well as^on the part of The
Call, is needed from this time on. We have cleaned
the city of the nefarious traffic. Let us keep it clean.
SflN FRANCISCO" AND Th|E WAR.
IN response to a telegram from Senator Perkins
suggesting that the Chamber of Commerce in this
city protest against the dispatch of the Monterey,
the Monadnock and all other armored vessels from
this coast, the chamber, through its president, Hugh
Craig, sent back this ringing reply: "We protested
on the 1 2th of April. In the meantime Dewey has
acquired for California a new outlet for our ener
gies, employment for our shipping, business for our
merchants, and opened a colonizing future for Amer
icans beyond our most ardent expectations, and we of
San Francisco will hold nothing back which may be
of service to the administration, even to our
jeopardy."
All San Francisco and all California will indorse
that reply. It gives clear and emphatic utterance to
the fervent patriotism of the people. Even if the
dispatch of the warships should leave us in greater
danger than we are likely to be, the great mass of our
people would still bid the ships godspeed in their
going to the front. California is fighting in this war.
She expects to stand her share of the danger as well
as to have her share of the glory. Her people yj\<- i
prompt and unquestioning support to the military
and naval authorities in the conduct of the war. Let
the call be for ships, men or money, the city arid Ihe
State will respond at once.
The Eastern States have to some extent hampered
the conduct of the campaign in the West Indies by
demanding that a portion of our fleet in the Atlantic
should be left to guard the coast of New England and
Middle Atlantic States. Fortunately our navy is
sufficiently superior to that of Spain to permit leaving
one or two ships off the northern coast without weak
ening too much the fleet that is to do the fighting in
the West Indies. Had this not been so the protests
of Boston and New York against the massing of the
whole navy at the point of danger might have com
promised our chances of success in battle. Even as
it is the course taken in those cities has not been one
to which they point with pride, and it is gratify
ing that San Francisco has not followed the example.
In times of war every citizen is more or less of a
combatant and owes something of a soldier's unques
tioning loyalty and obedience to orders. What the
Government directs to be done should be done with
out protest. The nation would be weak as a rop.e
of sand if in times of danger every State should look
out for itself and insist on keeping troops and war
ships to protect its own borders instead of sending
them to meet the common foe at the point the com
mander-in-chief selects. That course was followed
by New England in 1812. and the result was disastrous
along our whole northern border. The Chamber of
Commerce is right: "San Francisco will hold nothing
back which may be of service to the administration,
even to our jeopardy."
That the charter of the Centennial has been can
celed is cheering news. When the Government can
not get seaworthy craft to carry its soldiers they
would better be left at home.

afterward reached the rank of brigadier
general In the war of the rebellion, came
in contact with an epaulette which even
he could not decipher. The general,
formerly noted for his strict enforcement
of discipline and all the forms that per
tain to war, whether it be a matter of
military dress or ceremonious conduct,
was sitting in his office discussing with
Judge Thornton the momentous questions
of the day when a member of the Army
of Christ walked in with a bundle of
War Cries under his arm. Patronage was
solicited, and the general was about to
purchase a batch of papers, when his eyes
fell on the shoulder straps of the peace
ful warrior and he saw three stars on a
ground of red. Following out the military
formula for such things the general de
ciphered the epaulettes to mean the rank
of lieutenant general of artillery, an Im
possible thing. The peace dealing disciple
of the Army of Christ was questioned as
to the signflcance of his straps, and he
replied that he was a lieutenant general
of artillery. That settled his business
prospects In a moment, as far as General
Crittenden was concerned. Both parties
were ready to make the exchange. The
hero of -two, wars had the money in his'

ready for transference, but the bargain
Cama to a sudden end. The general re
fused to patronize a man that could com

It was with a sad face that the lieuten
ant general of artillery walked out of the
oflloe, and lie was hoard to murmur some
thing about the flintlness of the human
heart. General Crittenden said some sweet
things about high-titled commanders, and
then began to explain to Judge Thorn
ton why DeWey was a great man.

HOBSON AT ANNAPOLIS.
Remarkable Incident in the Career
of the Hero of Santiago.
San Diego Sun.
The exploit of Lieutenant Hobson and
his associates at Santiago de Cuba Is
to-day the talk of the world, and In con
nection therewith allow me to relate an
incident of his life while he was a cadet
at the naval academy at Annapolis, which
shows the stuff he is made of.
It was, I believe, during the first year
he was there that some discreditable act
was committed by some one of his class.
He was accused of It, and although deny
ing it, the class believed him guilty, and
sent him to .Coventry," which means
that no one of the class would speak to
him or in any manner recognize
him farther than rules compelled. And
so for two long years the ban lasted. For
two years no one of his class spoke to

the life at Annapolis academy can realize
the full significance of being consigned to
Coventry." For two years he drilled and
recited with his class, was intimately as
sociated with his fellows, and yet was
alone, ostracized.
After two years his class discovered
that he was not guilty, that at any time
during those awful two years he could
have restored himself by betraying the
guilty party, and that he did not do so
irom the very highest sense of honor.
When the facts came to be known to
the class the members were mortified be
yond description. They appointed a com
mittee to call on Cadet Hobson and lv.
the name of the class humbly apologize
for its behavior. .. . . â
He received the apology, thanked the
committee, and from that time on never

HOLMES AND THE POEM.
Edward Everett Hale met Oliver W<?n
dell Holmes at Harvard. They were both
members of the Phi Beta Kappa, a society
that existed, as the speaker humorously
asserted, for the sake of having a dinner
once a year. Upon one of these occasions
Dr. Hale wrote to Dr. Holmes, urging him
to be present. Dr. Holmes wrote back
that he would not come. Dr. Hala re
plied:
"My dear Holmes, who said anything
about a poem? We don't want your
poems, but the boys would all be very
glad to see you, so I hope you will come."
Dr. Holmes retorted: "My dear Hale,
the Idea of my appearing at a Phi Beta
Kappa dinner without a poem ia ridicu
lous. Besides, 1 have one already half
written, and shall be much disappointed
if you won't let me read it."

SOME SIGNIFICANT FACTS
PHELAN'S INTERESTS HAVE
BEEN INVOLVED.
Recent Occurrences That Seem to In
dicate That the Statesman Will
Ask to Be Returned to
Congress.
Has Congressman Maguire decided
to retire from the race for the nom
ination fur Governor on the Democratic
ticket?
This is the question that the shrewd
ones among the politicians of both par
ties are trying to solve. Ten days ago
the question had not even been sug
gested. The public had full faith in
the assertion that Maguire had burned
his bridges behind him and that if he
failed in his desire to win the place at
the head of the Democratic ticket he
would retire to private life and the con
templation of the many things he has
said and the few things he has done
during his career as a statesman.
To-day the aspect of the case is dif
ferent. Indc-ed, there are good grounds
for the belief that Maguire has decided
to remove his name from the list of
gubernatorial candidates and that he
will ask his party to aid in returning
him to Washington as Congressman
from the Fourth District. The morn
ing paper which assumes the doubtful
honor of being the mouthpiece of the
man who called American seamen pi
rates gave authoritative corroboration
n few clays ago to the alleged surrender
by Maguire of his cherished ambition
to become the Governor of the State of
California. In an editorial comment
ing on the indorsement of Maguire's
candidacy by a Democratic county
convention, the paper says:
The Tulare convention indorses Mp
Maguire for the Democratic nomination
: ivernor and instructs its represen
- in the Si utloo to support
him as lons as he ie a candidate. Whether
Mr. Maguire considers that he can serve
his Stat^ and himself best in Congress or
in the Governor's chair, this evidence that
the mud campaign that lias thus far been
waged against him has had no effect must
gratify his pride.
This, coming aB it were from Maguire
himpeir. is held as convincing proof
that the statesman has agreed with
himself to forego, f<>r the time being,
his determination to be Governor or
nothing. It is as if the Congressman
had said to the good Democrats of Tu
lare County:
"I thank you for your kindly expres
sion of fealty, and it may be that I will
avail myself of your votes. It all de
pends upon whether or not I decide to
again become a candidate for a seat in
< 'ongress.* 1
Tho expression of such a sentiment
as this, when considered in connection
with his many open and emphatic dec
larations that if he failed in his de
sire to secure the gubernatorial nomi
nation he would retire to private life.
Is open to but one construction. It is
that he has repented of his rash de
termination to achieve that what he
now finds is beyond his reach, and that
he will Boon surprise his friends with
the announcement that he believes his
duty to himself and his country de
mands that he return to the halls of
('â¢ingress as a humble representative
of the Fourth <"'ongres?ional District.
Th^ conditions that are to be held
accountable for this chanpe of heart are
plain to every one. Within the space
of a very fp\v weeks Maguire has
f<">und that instead of being a man of
the people with a popular following In
his own party, he Is. instead, a man
whopp scalp is sought f<>r by the Stntp
administration; a stumbling block In
the way of the soaring political ambi
tions of Mayor Phelan; an object of de
testation for all patriotic citizens who
resent his declaration that the brave
men of the American navy are pirates;
the ardent advocate of economic prin
ciples that are intended to saddle the
burden of taxation on worklngmen and
the â¢ farming elapses. Besides these
things he has found that he must di
vide with Mayor Phelan the love and
support of the venal editor of the al
leged organ of the Democratic party â a
pupport that cannot be given to two
men, both of whom want to be the next
Governor of th<* Stateâ and also that
all political authorities agree and the
recent election In Oregon proves that
this is to b^ a Republican year. Small
wonder that he should stand appalled
at the situation and conclude that he
"can serve his State and himself best"
by asking to be returned to Congress.
With Maguire out of the race the
gubernatorial aspirations of Phelan be
come Fomewhat formidable from the
standpoint of such oth^r Democrats as
would not be averse to accenting the
place at the head of th^ ticket. An
additional proof that the Mayor has
finally decided to attempt to climb to
the top of th<Â» political ladder is found
In the rumor that Andy Lawrence is
seeking the nomination for Lieutenant-
Governor. This ambition of Law
rence's is not tak^n seriously by any
one, with the possible exception of Phe
lan and Lawrencp himself. Should he
become a candidate for this or any
ofh^r office the fact would afford an
opportunity for the publication of his
record as an Assemblyman, a proceed
ing that would be Instructive, so far
as the public is concerned, but would
prove disastrous to the party with
Mhich his name is connected. It is not
Hkelv that the party leaders will so
far forget themselves as to commit po

WILL BE MARRIED AT ST. DOMINIC'S

litical hara-kiri by permitting the use
of Lawrence's name in any position on
the State ticket.
Phelan would like to be Mayor un
der the new charter, but the charter
does not po into effect until 1900. Be- j
sides, there is the contingency that the
Legislature will refuse to ratify the j
city's proposed organic law. It is also j
probable that the Mayor fears that his
popularity will not stand the strain of
another two years as Mayor under the
present law. which has shown him to
be a poor judge of the "heft" of the
bags of coin in the city treasury. The
sudden resumption o-f the Mayor's
chase after gubernatorial honors rnrne*
at the same time as Maguire's relin
quishment of a like quest and Law
rence's reach for deputy executive hon.
ors. The details are lacking, but the
connection seems to be apparent.

WAR BONDS

Premature.
A WASHINGTON DISPATCH
WOULD -BE BUYERS MUST BE
PATIENT.
I. W. Hellman Jr. Says the Work Al
ready Done Must All Be Gone
Over When Official
Blanks Arrive.
Those who have already subscribed for
the new 3 per cent Government war bonds
will be rather badly disappointed when
they learn that they will have to go over
the work again. The First National Bank
of this city commenced receiving sub
scriptions Monday and the bank officials
have since then been kept busy attending
to the rush of applicants. There is such
a demand for the bonds that in some in
stances intending subscribers have had to
stand In line for hours waiting for their
turn at the desk.
A dispatch received yesterday by the
Nevada National Bank of San Francisco,
from Assistant Secretary of the Treasury
F. V. Vanderlik, seems to prove that the
taking of subscriptions has been prema
ture.
The Nevada National Bank and the
Union Trust Company probably handle
more Government securities than any
similar banking institution in the city.
The officers of the Nevada Bank thought
it strange that they had not been offi
cially notified of the call for subscrip
tions for the new bond issue and accord
ingly sent the following telegram to the
Treasury Department:
SAN FRANCISCO, June 8. 1898.
Honorable Secretary of Treasury, Washing
ton, I>. C. : Please mail us as early as possi
ble, blank applications for authority to receive
subscriptions for the new bonds.
Nevada National Bank of San FranciÂ»co.
A few hours later the following reply
was received.
AVASHINGTON, D. C, June 8. 1898.
Nevada National Dank of San Franci9co:
Subscription blanks and circular of informa
tion Will bo sent you as goon as bill becomes
law. F. V. VAXDERLIK.
Assistant Secretary.
"It will prove disappointing to those
who have subscribed," said I. \V. Hell
man Jr., of the Union Trust Company,
yesterday afternoon, "to learn that they
will have to go through the same routine
again. I was surprised when I heard that
subscriptions were being taken, for the
bill authorizing the Issuance of the bonds
has not yet been signed by the President,
and consequently is not yet a law. Judg
ing from the press dispatches, President
McKinley is not expected to sign the bill
before Saturday. The Government will
then prepare a certain form of subscrip
tion blanks and these will be sent to the
different National banks throughout the
country." ___^_^______

on their return will occupy their elegant
new residence, the gift of the bride's
mother, at 2737 California street.
WILL REVIVE
OLD TROUBLES
A. B. Bowers' $500,000
Damage Suit.
THE GOVERNMENT DEFENDANT
INFBINGEMENT OF PATENT THE
CAUSE OF ACTION.
The Government's Defense May-
Prove Bowers Guilty of
Perjury and
Fraud.
The litigation waged for years to a suc
cessful issue by Alphonso B. Bowers
against all builders and users of steam
river and harbor dredgers is about to be
revived, and Bowers' victories seem in a
fair way to be lost to him.
Bowers recently brought suit against
the United States Government for dam
ages to the tune of $300,000, alleging in
fringement of patents as his cause of
action.
The Government is actively engaged in
preparing its defense and has found one
witness in John A. Ball, whose claims
and allegations, if they prove correct
will btrip Bowers of his patents and
prove him guilty of perjury and fraud
against the Government on a trieantic
scale.
Mr. Ball, whose cause has heen es
poused by General W. H. PI. Hart, claims
that he was the original inventor of a
number of the chief features of the
dredger patented by Bowers. He further
claims that a number of the principles,
particularly the oscillating device, al
though invented by him, were not' pat
ented, and that they had been in general
use for three years prior to the time of
Bowers' application. Furthermore, he de
clares, Bowers was aware of their general
use and successful operation, having fre
quently investigated the dredgers used by
Ball.
The witness declares that Bowers is
guilty of perjury and fraud in applying
for the patents he hold?, as the general
law provides that any device in general
use for more that two year 3 cannot be
patented. .
To back up his cape* Mr. Ball has the
depositions of a number of his employes,
who were with him in the early 70's, as
well as the affidavits of a number of en
gineers, who inspected his work at that
time.
Tho Government nns* ordered General
Hart to bring a mimber of these people
to Washington and the case will be fought
out upon their testimony.
Balked by a Dog.
Two m<*n attempted to break Into the
Symon residence, 120 Mississippi street,
Tuesday night, but were balked by a
Newfoundland dog, which gave the
alarm and kept one of them at bay till
John Symon, one of the sons, went out
and collared him. James, another son,
gave chaue to the other man, but failed
to capture him. The captive was handed
over to Lieutenant Anderson at the Po
trero station, where he gave the name of
Vigonli Antonio. He was charged with
vagrancy. _
The Clarkson Trial.
The taklnp of testimony in the trial of
William Clarkson.late foreman of the roll
ing department of the United States Mint
in this city, was concluded yesterday af
ternoon. Clarkson went on the stand and
denied point blank that he had ever griven
any gold bullion to either Carter or Eg-
Kfirs, and said at the times specified in the
Indictment when it was eald ti.at he
brought bullion to them he was else
where. The case will be argued to the
jury this morning.

In the divorce suit of Thomas Sullivan
versus Lily Sullivan, a decree of divorce

well's court yesterday. She was also

Thomas Sullivan dfd not appear and the

Poisoned His Chickens.
A. D. Long, 40 Albert lane, swore out a
warrant in Judge Mogan's court yester
day for the arrest of Mrs. Miller, who
lives in the flat above him, on a charge of
cruelty to animals. Long said that he
owned about seventy chickens-, but re
cently he has lost twenty of them. He
noticed that they turned green before
they died, which puzzled him, and he
made an investigation. He discovered
that Mrs. Miller threw mush into his
yard, and Tuesday he took a portion of
the mush to the Board of Health for
analysis. The analysis showed that the
mush was mixed up with carbolic acid.

EXPLANATION.
Th arrow flies with the wind. The top fig
ures at station Indicate minimum temperature
for the liuy;. ; those underneath it. if any, the
amount of rainfall or of melted snow in Inches
nn<3 bundredths during the last twelve hours,
rs, or solid lines, connect points of equal
air pressure; isotherms, or dotted lines, equal
temperature. The word "high" means high
barometric pressure and is usually accompanied
by fair weather: "low" refers to low pres
eure and is usually preceded and accompanied
by clou.lv weather and rains. "Lows" usually
tirst appear on the Washington coast. When
the pressure is high In the Interior and low
along the coast, and the Isobars extend north
nnd south along: the coast, rain is probable:
but when the "low" is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is lm- i
fr ibable. With a "high" in the vicinity of
daho, and th<? rressure falling to the Call
fornia coast, warmer weather mey be expected
In summer and colder weather In winter. The
reverse of these conditions will produce an
opposite result.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, June B.â The bears secured the
upper hand again In to-day's stock market
through the instrumentality of sugar, which
went through one of Its old-fashioned acrobatic
performances and easily dominated the whole
list. Its fluctuations were frequent and violent,
over an extreme range of over 4 points, and
though it made several substantial recoveries
each successive dip carried It to a lower level
than before and the close was only slightly
above the lowest. The violent declines dis
lodged torrent.* of stock, which came pouring
upon the market in blocks of 1000 shares. The
quick rally Indicated that shorts were losing
no time in covering. A realizing movement Is
generally expected In sugar upon the declara
tion of the dividend*, but the savage onslaught
upon the stock was doubtless contributed to by
the powerful speculative element, which has
been working for a reaction for several days
paÂ»t to buy stocks at a lower level . than they
were .â â  ii to realize last week. To-day was
the ginning of a periodical settlement on the
London Stock Exchange, and it has been cur
rent opinion in Wall street that there are some
heavy outstanding short accounts there In
Americans. St. I'aul, in which the foreign
short account wus believed to be the heaviest,
bruke ht-avily anil there was very large ab
sorption of the stock at the decline and on the
recovery. Although London, sold here through
crbitrage houses there was no doubt some buy-
Ing Cor London account through other channels.
There was a substantial rally late in the day
on the covering of shorts and In" sympathy
with the strength In individual stocks, and
later the break In sugar was Ignored" in the
penerul list. The final rally reduced most of
the net losses to fractions and left substan
tial gains in many special cases. .
Prices of bonds were better held than stocks
and net trains .were' better distributed. Total
sales $2.92.1.000. * ' " ' - -

NEW YORK. Juno S.â The Evening; Posfs
London financial cablegram says: The stock
markets here were quiet and rather dull to
day. Consols and India stocks were lower on
the prospect of a new India loan of Â£10,000.
000 sterling next month. Argentines, Spanish
4s and other foreign stocks were dull in sym
pathy with the Paris Bourse, but Brazils were
hard, exchange being at "%.
The account in Americans at the settlement
was rather larger than expected, tut con
tangoes were only BfpStf per cent. The tone
was steadier, but the close was under the best.
There is no public dealing yet. The failure of
Hooley, the millionaire operator. Is not likely
to materially a*fiÂ«ct the market".
In consequence of the continued decline In
open market of money quotations, it is ex
pected that discount houses will lower deposit
rates to-morrow.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. June The chief factor of
strength' ln wheat was the unexpected advance
In Liverpool cables .; which quoted an Improve
ment In July equal. to 4M,c per bushel. Septem
ber In that market. was likewise higher, but In
much less marked decree than July. Besides
the -strength of. the- Liverpool, market there
were fears that the' domestic crop had been In
jured by too much rain. ' Shorts became ex
ceedingly- nervous and there was an unufnial
rush to cover, partly to secure profits ' which
yet remained and partly to stop further losses.
There was also some demand for the long ac
count from scalper*, who reasoned that after
such 'a drop as we have had It was time for
the pendulum to .rwlng the other way. The
trade wan nervous . for a time and took little
note of anything: but the bull factor*. Later,
however, it was believed that no real damage
to the crop had been experienced, and that the
recent statistics as to the world's nr^sent sup
plies were really bearish. The Idea of manipu
| lated Liverpool â¢ markets beran to take \ root.
I the bears regained their courage and began to
fight the advance. The close was fairly steady,
! July closing with a gain of l%c and September
IW.OJV4C . : . â . .
Steadier cables and the heavy rainfall
throughout the com States last night Influenced
corn at the start. The advance met heavy sell
ing by bears and was partly lost. July closed
Uc higher.
Oats are ) unchanged from yesterday. The"
fluctuations were within a very narrow range.
' Provisions were easy at the start. A firm
feeling prevailed near the. close, pork closing
with an advnnc" of 5 cents, lard unchanged
and ribs 2Hc lower. ,

THE WOOL MARKET.
BOSTON. June B.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow of the
wool trade:
Prices are more firmly maintained than at
any time for weeks, while sales are smaller.
The renl cause of the activity Is traefÂ»<i to the
fact that the demand for wool to go into army
goods seems to have been about satisfied for
the present at least. At the moment the prin
cipal concern of the trade is to arrive at an un
derstanding with the growers that will admit
of a profit in the seaboard mnrkÂ«*M. However,
the West has shown no marked disposition to
concede anyth'ng In the matter of prices. It
Is believed that stock* of wuol on hand in the
mills are becoming depleted nnd that mill own
er? will soon be forced quite generally into thÂ»
market. The sales of the week In Boston
amemt to 615..-.00 pounds domestic and 3?<5 ."iff)
of foreign, making a t.tal of ftsi.OOO. against a
V tal of 1. 335.000 In the previous week nnd a to
tal of 7,170,000 for the corresponding week last
rear. Sales since January l. l^g, amount to
51,<464,310 pounds, against 164,465,(00 pounds last
year at this time.

His Wife Files a Paper
Full of Sensation.
LIGHT ON A MYSTERY
HOW MONEY WAS OBTAINED TO
DEFEND OTHERS.
Another Chapter of the Story of
the Death of Young Annie
Johnson Last
Year.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, June 8.
George H. Francour of San Francisco i
Is suing Ernest N. Jones and Gertrude
K. Jonrs to recover payment of a prom
issory not* signed by Mrs. Jones.
To-day Mrs. Jones filed her answer and i
reveals a story full of sensation. She |
Bays that prior to 1597 she and Jones j
lived together as husband and wife, and j
she had perfect confidence in him. In
November, 1596, Anni*. Johnson entered I
thf>!r service as a maid. In the early part j
of last year this Annie Johnson died un
der suspicious circumstances, and Dr. C. !
J. Sharp and John Howard, who has
since married Annie Johnson's sister, were
tried for being responsible for the death
of Annie, but were acquitted.
At the time of the trial it was freely j
asserted that John Howard was not tne
guilty party, but that he was being used j
to protect a married man, whose name j
was not divulged. Certain it is that money 5
was forthcoming to defend Howard from ;
outside sources. According to Mrs. Jones'
answer she says that two months ago
Bhe discovered that Jones was not worthy j
of her confidence, and she brought suit i
for a divorce which is still pending. She j
denies that she ever delivered the note ]
to Francour upon which he is now suing.
And she says that her husband entered
Into a conspiracy with others to obtain ,
money from her. They represented to her ;
she related, that they were in danger of J
exposure from blackmailers and from i
newspaper reporters, who were threaten- '
Ing to give them unwelcome publicity In
connection with Annie Johnson's death.
She says that on these representations ]
she was induced to furnish them with i
money, and also while she was ill signed i
a note for $500. While believing -these
stories told by her husband, Mrs. Jones
authorized them to employ a good law
yer to defend them, and 6ayÃ they con
spired to suppress testimony and keep it i
from the District Attorney who conducted
the prosecution. Mrs. Jones further al- I
leges that altogether they secured from I
her $2500 between January 1. 1897. and May !
1. IS9S. Her attorneys are Messrs. Knight
& Heggerty.
The facts contained in Mrs. Jones' an
swer substantiate a story told by one of i
the attorneys in the case, but never be- |
fore made public. When Annie Johnson was
dying she frequently called for a man
named "Ernest," and to one of her girl
friends named Esther Nerney she con- j
liii^d the fact that Howard was not the
party responsible for her death. Some of:
tIK-se facts were told in whispers, but I
could not be substantiated at the time. ;
Since then it has often been stated that i
Jones obtained money from his wife upon '
the plea that his reputation was in dan- '
ger, and that it was necessary to use j
hush money. One of those men
tloned whom it was considered neces- j
eary to keep silent was so indignant when !
he heard the story that he w*Â»nt to one '
of the attorneys interested in the case and
ttdvi.ued with him as to running the mat
ter down for the purpose of guarding his
reputation.
The answer of Mrs. Jones has reopened
the case and will no doubt lead to
many exposures.
Late this afternoon the answer of Mrs.
Jones was withdrawn in accordance with
a stipulation entered into between coun-
Bel on both sides.
THE KILLING OF
HUGH WEBSTER WILLIAMS.
PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION
COMMENCED IN ALAMEDA.
The Prosecution Presents Its Side of
the Case â The Defense Will Offer
Evidence To-Morrow Night.
ALAMEDA, June B.â The preliminary
examination of William M. Gregory and
Abigail Miranda Gregory, on the charge
of murdering Hugh Webster Williams in
this city on the 22d ult. was commenced

torney Snook and the defense by Attor
ney H. H. Davis of San Francisco.
Preliminary to the commencement of
the examination all the witnesses were

Levi Siemmens was the first witness. !
He testified, as at the Coroner's Inquest, !
that he was hailed by Gregory, who was ;
covered with blood, and went with him '
into the house, where he found Williams â 
lying on the floor. Mrs. Gregory at first \
said ehe shot Williams, and afterward .
said she did not know whether she did or
not. Witness took the body of Williams
to the Morgue In his wagon. Gregory
had a black eye and bis face was
wounded. .
Officer Lawrence testified that he went
â with Gregory- from the police station to
the house. On the way down Gregory
said to him, speaking of Williams; "He
is laid out. He is the man who broke up
my home."
He also told what Mrs. Gregory said
about the affair, her account oeing the
same as already published.
Sergeant Conrad testified that Gregory
came to the police station, where he
was on duty, and told him that he had
had a fight down on Eagle avenue and
that he had better go down there. Mrs.
Gregory showed him her wrist swollen
and black, and told him how the affair
occurred. She said to him that she grab
bed the pistol and pointed It at Williams,
but did not know whether she shot him
or not.
Mrs. Courtofs testified that she was em
ployed by Mrs. Gregory as a servant.
She did not know "William*. On the day
In question he came into the house and
went into Mrs. Gregory's bedroom. She
heard the shot fired, but did not see any
pistol. After the shot was fired she saw
Gregory drag Williams into the kitchen.
She went into the room while the men
were fighting. Both were standing up
and had hold of each other.
Chief of Police Rogers testified to ob
taining possession of the pistol and find
ing one empty shell in it. Â«
This was the case for the prosecution,
and Attorney Davis for the defense then
moved that the defendant be discharged,
on the ground that the evidence adduced
by the prosecution did not clearly con
tain the elements of the offense charged.
The District Attorney objected and
claimed that the evidence of Dr. Buteau
alone was sufficient to hold them. Jus
tice Morris denied the motion ajid an ad
journment was taken until Thursday
evening at 8 o'clock, when the defense
will present its evidence.

SPANISH SPIES
IN OLD MEXICO
SEAPOSTS FULL OF SYMPATHIZ
ERS WITH THE ENEMY.
Treasury Department Gives Warning
for the Benefit of Captains of
American Vessels.
. W. B. Howell, Assistant Secretary of
the Treasury, addressed a letter "to Col
lector Jackson, received by the Collector
yesterday, which emphasizes the neces
sity of watchfulness on the part of the
masters of American vessels as against
the machinations of Spanish spies. The
letter is as follows:
Dear Sir: Your attention Is Invited to the
following extract from a recent dlsi>atch of
a consul of the United States at a Mexican j
port, which you are requested to bring to the
notice of the master of any vessel clearing
from your port to a port in Mexico:
"There is a very bitter feeling among
the Spaniards, not only here in this city
but everywhere along the coast in Coatza
coalcos, Fronteraâ in fact all over.- the
country where Spaniards are to be foundâ
and they are continually trying, by dis
tribution of circulars and otherwise, to
prejudice the minds of the Mexican people
against the Americans. â¦ â¢ â¢ From all
the information I get, and from what I
hear and see myself, I strongly recom
mend that captains of American, as well
as foreign vessels chartered by Ameri
cans, coming to ports of this country,
should be warned to be careful about '
whom they allow on board their vessels
to prevent any accident."

ILL-TREATED HIS WIFE,
Mrs. Lillie Sullivan Granted a Decree
of Divorce From Thomas
Sullivan.
Mrs. Lillie Sullivan, wife of Thomas
Sullivan, a well known member of the
Cosmos Club, wad granted a divorce yes
terday by Judge Seawell. Some time ago
Mrs. Sullivan left her husband on ac
count of his ill treatment and went to
live with her parents. After the statu
tory time had elapsed Sullivan filed suit
for divorce against his wife on the
ground of desertion. Mrs. Sullivan filed
an answer, setting forth the facts that
led her to leave her husband, and a cross
complaint, in which she prayed that the
court grant her a decree on the grounds
of willful desertion and failure to pro
vide. Sullivan, when he found that his
wife was going into court and contest his
allegations, abandoned his suit and his
default was made a matter of record.
Evidence in the case was heard by Judge
Seav/ell yesterday, with the result that
he granted her a decree on the grounds
mentioned.
GREENE FORGERY CASE.
The Preliminary Examination Com-
menced Before Judge Mogan.
The case of Attorney A. J. Greene,
charged with forgery by John Lapique,
was called in Judge Mogan's court yes
terday. Attorney Prescott, who repre
sented Lapique, asked for a continuance,
but Greene and Attorney J. D. Sullivan
strongly opposed it, as they said they
had the documents to prove Greene's in
nocence.
It was finally decided to take the evi
dence of Attorneys H. N. Clement and
Henry E. Highton. who were witnesses
for the defense, and were anxious to get
away. Their evidence referred to the set
tlement of a claim that Clement had on
the estate of Jean Louis Ader, based
upon a promissory note for $1000. which
Clement had given to Highton. Attorney
Prescott moved that the evidence should
be stricken out, as it had no bearing
upon the case, and the Judge said he
would reserve his decision.
Attorney Highton was being cross-ex
amined as to his business connections
with Lapique, when a continuance was
granted till this afternoon to enable him
to refresh his memory. Greene claims
that he has a good case.

Thirty-fourth District Democratic Club do
hereby denounce the action of the State Cen
tral Committee in appointing a Committee of
One Hundred to conduct the affairs of the
Democratic party of the City and County of
San Franclaeo, as we consider said action to
be arbitrary and UnDemocratic, and not in
accordance with the plan of organization of
the Democratic party.
Resolved, That said nctiOH was a usurpa

Committee; and be it further
Resolved. That a committee of three be ap
pointed by the chair to confer with the Demo

To Disoar "Black" Coffey.
John J. Coffey, a Police Court practi
tioner, otherwise known as "Black" Cof
fey, stands a good chance of being de
prived of the right to practice in any
court. A short time ago he was convict
ed in the Police Court of a misdemeanor,
for .having attempted to extort money by
verbal threats. Judge Joachimsen im
posed a fine. All this has caused the legal
fraternity to believe that Coffey is not fit
to represent the profession In court or
out. In order to prevent him from so do
ing In the future action has been brought
In the Supreme Court citing him to ap-
Eear and show cause why he should not
c disbarred.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JUNE 9, 1898.
MANY NOTES
YET UNPAID
German Loan Society
Sues to Recover.
BIG BROADWAY MORTGAGE
Q. G. BAKER MADE THE DEAL
SIX YEARS AGO.
Twenty Notes Were Executed, but
Only Four Have Been Paid.
Much Interest
Sue.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, June 8.
The manner In which a large block of
unimproved city property can eat up a
fortune in interest was told In complaints
filed this afternoon in the Superior Court.
The German Savings and Loan Society
has sued George G. Baker, "W. J. Din
j gee, the Real Estate Combine, W. F.
Lewis, John and Richard Roe, for $60,000.
There is a separate suit filed against each
defendant. G. G. Baker has not resided
in this State for more than a year.
The suit is based on a land deal made
In June, 1892. The property is located on
Broadway, between Fourteenth and Fif
teenth streets, and is a large vacant lot
124x100 feet. In 1892 it was one of the
most valuable blocks in the city, but the
move of the city westward has caused it
to depreciate in value.
To guarantee payment notes were exe
cuted on each of the five lots of which the
i block is composed. Four notes of $4500.
i four of $3500. four of $4200, four of $4000 and
â¢ four of $3750 were executed and were to
I carry interest at the rate of S-12 per
! cent per month, compounded monthly.
j The notes were made by George Baker to
\V. J. Dingee, and were guaranteed by a
mortgage of the bank.
W. J. Dingee disposed of the notes to
j the German Savings and Loan Society
i and the first note of each four was paid,
i The remainder were to be paid at inter
; vals of a year. Since the first payment
I was made the interest has been regularly
I paid up to December 9 of last year.
Three of each serise of notes and In
terest from last December are now due,
: and the German society has brought suit
Ito foreclose on the property, the total
! amount- due being $Co.ooo.
Mr. Dingee disposed of his Interest to
the loan society three weeks after ac
cepting the mortgage, and is merely a
formal defendant, G. G. Baker being the
maker of all the notes.

MAN'S INFATUATION
FOR A PRETTY WOMAN
LOVE IN SOUTH AFRICA ENDS IN
THE POLICE COURT.
Lena Surprenant, Alias Flossie Ed
wards, Arrested on Complaint
of Oscar Frederickson.
Another case of a man's infatuation for
a pretty woman will be heard in Judge
Mogan's court to-day. The complaining
witness is Oscar Frederickson, a civil en
gineer, and the woman Is Lena Surpre
nant, alias Flossie Edwards, who, about
two years ago, was the inmate of a house
on Quincy place.
Frederickson worked for the Homestead
Mining Company, Black Hilla, and it sent
him to South Africa about a year ago.
While in Johannesburg he met Lena and
they lived together. According to Fred
erickson she was always expressing a de
sire to get back to this city, but had no
money, and finally he consented to take
her back. The night before they sailed
from Cape Town he got drunk and she
stole Â£200 from his belt and obtained a
bank draft for the amount In her own
name. When he accused her of taking
the money sbe told him she would give it
to him when they reached this city. They
arrived here about two weeks ago and
took rooms in the Milton Houae, 158 Third
street. Tuesday she removed her bag
fage from the house and stole $S5 from
Yederickson's pockets. She gave the
landlady $25, telling her to give It to her
husband, as she was going to the springs.
Frederickson reported the case to tha
police and Detectives Ryan and ODea
arrested Lena at 325 Bush street. Yester
day she was booked at the City Prison on
a charge of grand larceny, and another
charge of having obscene pictures in her
possession was registered against her.
Lena tells a different story. She says
when she met Frederickson he was In
hard luck and she loaned him Â£40. She
also paid his fare to this city and the
draft was her own money. She denied
taking: the $85 from his pocket.

ERNEST TERAH
HOOLEY FAILS
The Company Promoter
a Bankrupt.
TWO MILLIONS IN DEBT
COLLAPSE HASTENED BY A
CBEDITOR'S SUIT.
Rise and Fall of a Man Noted for
His Prodigality and for
His Skill as a
"Boomer."
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, June B.â A receiving or
der In bankruptcy has been issued
against Ernest Terah Hooley. for years
prominent as the biggest company pro
moter in this country, prominently in
terested in bicycles, land and other con
cerns, and supposed to have been a
multi-millionaire.
Mr. Hooley reached the pinnacle of
prominence in 1896, when he promoted
the Dunlop Tire Company and was
supposed to have cleared $12,500,000 by
that deal alone. He has since been
identified with the promotion of the
Bovril Company and with many bi
cycle companies. It is understood not
any of the latter was profitable to the
stockholders.
In the meantime, however, Mr. Hoo
ley lived a sort of Monte Cristo exist
ence, bought yachts and race horses
and numerous historic country seats..
In January of the present year he
purchased the racing cutter Britannia,
formerly the property of the Prince of
Wales, from John Lawaon Johnstone.
During 1896 he purchased the schooner
yacht Verena from the Earl of Lons
dale. He is a member of a number of
yacht clubs.
For months past financiers have pre
dicted Mr. Hooley was in deep water.
The markets were not affected by the
downfall of Mr. Hooley, as the news
of the receiving order was not unex
pected in these quarters. An attempt
to float Hooley's bills was a failure,
although 10 per cent was offered, but it
is believed there is considerable of his
paper in existence. It will be the sec
ond and third class institutions which
will suffer by his failure. The shares
with which Mr. Hooley was connected
slumped lately, but the London mar
ket did not take much share in the
gambling.
It has been well known that Mr.
Hooley had been unable to find money
for the big Chinese loan which he pro
posed to float some time ago, and there
was much talk a year since, when the
authorities of St. Paul's Cathedral ac
cepted from Mr. Hooley a magnificent
gold communion service.
To-day's petition in bankruptcy was
made by Mr. Hooley personally, who
described himself as of "Berkeley
square, London, Risley Hall, near Der
by, and Papworth Hall, Cambridge
shire."
It is said that actions aggregating
$2,000,000 are now pending against Hoo
ley, and that one for $265,000, which
was set for a hearing to-morrow, pre
cipitated the crisis.
The capitals of the companies pro
moted by the bankrupt aggregate from
$60,000,000 to $65,000,000, and the shares
in these concerns, as a whole, have de
preciated over 40 per cent since their
flotation. ________________
YSAYE'S FAREWELL
TO SAN FRANCISCO
A LAUREL WREATH FOR THE
YOUNG CELLIST.
If Ysaye had never played anything
else, if he were never to play again, he
might stake his reputation upon his ren
dition of Bach yesterday afternoon.
It was a marvel of techinque, a mas
tery of the intricacies of the great com
position and the deep chords of the or
gan-like solo that beautifies and human
izes it. If you had never heard Ysaye
play Bach you would have ueclared, after
hearing the Kreutzer Sonata, that his
forte was Beethoven: but the large audi
ence that was content with three recalls
after the sonata was seized with musical
madness when the last long, beautiful
note of the Bach number fell from
Ysaye's violin. It shouted "Hochs!" and
"Bravos!" with all sorts o. variations of
sounds in the vowels, till the great vio
linist responded with something more
than a profound bow.
Gerardy, too, fell a prey to this insati
able audience. He played Saint Saens'
concerto in A minor, and was presented
with a laurel wreath. Then he gave the
Kol Nldre, the ideal expression of the
cello, played with such exquisitely sym
pathetic expression that had his instru
ment been a human voice, a .deep, vel
vety, musical bass, it could not have
sung the fine old Hebrew prayer more
effectively.
Those who have considered Lachaume's
playing as cold, lacking in sentiment,
should have heard him play the Moon
light Sonata yesterday afternoon. The
first Blow movement particularly was
rich in tone and full of expression.
Lachaume excels in rapid, soft staccato.
In the second movement of the Kreutzer
Sonata the delicacy of the piano accom
paniment was worthy the honor of play
ing second to Ysaye's violin.
Yesterday's concert was the farewell
of Ysaye and Gerardy to San FranclÃco.
They leave immediately for the north.

MURDER IN THE
FIRST DEGREE
Theodore Park Haynes
Found Guilty.
WILL NOT HANG, HOWEVER
LIFE IMPBISONMENT THE PEN-
ALTY IMPOSED.
The Aged Slayer of Police Lieutenant
Burke Made No Comment
When the Verdict Wag
Bead.
The declining years of aged Theodore
Park Haynes, the slayer of Police Lieu
tenant Burke, will be spent behind prison
bars. The jury selected to determine his
fate deliberated several hours before tt
reached a decision yesterday morning.
Argument for and against the prisoner
closed Tuesday afternoon, the judge de
livered his charge and the jury retired to
deliberate on the verdict. Night came but
a decision had not yet been reached, so
Judge Wallace ordered the Jury locked up
until the morning. The jury debated the
case all night, and it was not until short
ly before court convened that the jurors
became of one mind. From the first seven
Jurors were of the opinion that the mur
derer should be hanged for his crime,
three declared that he should not go to
the gallows, but to prison i.or life and
two, Jurors Brown and Wetmore, were
firmly convinced that the prisoner v as in
sane and thereby should be acquitted.
Finally the advocates of the hanging sen
tence agreed to life imprisonment, Brown
and Wetmore weakened and the bailiff
was informed that the jury was ready to
report with its verdict.
Haynes, unnerved and trembling, made
no comment when the verdict was an
nounced. It was thought that the aged
criminal would create a scene and de
nounce his prosecutors, but he remained
silent. Judge Wallace appointed next
Monday for the pronouncing of Judgment,
and Haynes was led from the court room
back to his cell in the Broadway Jail.
The Railroad Demurs.
Two demurrers filed with the Board
of State Railway Commissioners by
C. P. Huntington as an individual and
the Southern Pacific and the Central Pa
citic Companies as corporations, In the
matter of John R. Robinson, were con
sidered by the Railway Commission yes
terday, but no action was taken. The. de
murrers object to the complaint on the
grounds of lack of jurisdiction on the part
of the Railway Commission and that it
does not state facts sufficient to consti
tute a cause of action.
Warrant Withdrawn-
Henry Mayer, tailor, 40 Montgomery
street, yesterday withdrew the warrant
which he had sworn out the previous day
for the arrest of his son George on a
charge of vagrancy. The boy called at
police headquarters to surrender himself
yesterday morning. He said that he had
enlisted in the Fourteenth Infantry ten
days ago, and denied the allegations of
his father that he in any way misbehaved
himself.

CINCINNATI. June 8.-Only three
starters are named for the big Latonla
Derby which will be run to-morrow, the
opening day of the Latonia Jockey Club's
spring meeting. A heavy rain fell to-day
and the great race will in all probability
be run over a muddy track T-e starters
are: Plaudit. 127 (W. Martin); Han dOr,
114 (Beauchamp), and Don Quixote, 114
(Clayton). Plaudit will, of course, be an
odds-on favorite, having won two Derbies
already this spring. Ho seems to hold
the others safe. However, there is likely
to be a surprise sprung in the race, as
Han dOr has been working well and Don
Quixote is by no means considered out
of it.

SALARIES TO
BE ADJUSTED
School Director Waller's
Plan of Equalization.
FOULKS KEEPS HIS PLACE
FINALLY MADE PRINCIPAL OF \
BUSINESS EVENING SCHOOL.
Assignments of Teachers â Creditors
Will Be Given First Chance
at the Department's
Funds.
The meeting of the Board of Education
was marked by two Interesting events
yesterdayâ a parliamentary struggle for
position' by O. EL Foulks and a new
scheme to adjust salaries submitted by
Director Waller.
Gallagher moved to reconsider the reso
lution appointing G. H. Foulks principal
of the business evening school, and Armer
raised the point of order that the time
for reconsideration had passed, there hav
ing been a regular meeting since the
notice of motion. Gallagher contended
that he had no chance to bring up the
matter before. The president overruled
Armer's point of order and Armer ap
pealed. The appeal was lost and the
resolution came up for reconsideration.
The motion to reconsider was lost.
Director Waller's plan to adjust salaries
refers to principals mainly. It is a scheme
to make the relation between the salary
of the principal and the number of pupils
and classes a little more equitable than
it is at present. The plan is embodied
in the following outline:
Principals of grammar schools of the first
class (as per section 49, article i) of the rules
of the Board of Education shall receive $115
for the first class, and an additional sum of
j.' per class, the maximum salary of prin
cipals ci grammar schools shall, however, in
no event exceed $200.
Principals of intermediate grammar schools
(as rr p r section 49, article 6) shall receive $S5
for the first class, and $5 Tor each additional
class.
Principals of primary schools of the first
class (as per section 49, article 4) shall receive
$:'.". for the first class and $5 for each ad
ditional class.
Principals of primary BChools of the second
and third class las per section 49. articles 2 and
3) and such other schools as contain less than
IP<l pupils of primary or mixed grades shall
receive the sum of K>s for the first class, and
$5 for each additional class, provided, how
ever, that schools containing not more than
one class shall receive but $90.
In explanation it may be stated there
are 412 grammar grade pupils and ten |
classes; in the Hearst there are 4V. gram- .
mar and 299 primary pupils and seventeeen
classes; In the Pacitio Hoights there are-|
411 grammar and 207 primary pupils and j
fifteen classes, and in the Denman there j
are 40S grammar and 2:U primary pupils
and sixteen classes. In all cases the sal
ary of the principal is $175, which is for
the care of but 412 pupils in the Hancock
and over 700 pupils in the Hearst, and ,
over 600 pupils in the others mentioned.
Under Director Waller's plan the salaries :
would be adjusted in this way: Han- ;
cock, $160; Hearst. $195; Pacific Heights,
flB6, and Denman, $190. There are other ;
similar instances all through the depart
ment.
Mr Waller read his plan at the meet-
Ing, and it was referred to a meeting of <
the committee of the whole for discus- j
slon.
Superintendent Webster's report com
mended the work of the department. He -
said the courses prescribed had, except in I
a few cases, been well carried out. Pro- !
gress in arithmetic had been particularly
good but that In grammar was poor. It J
is noted that the number of children
under 18 years of age has decreased 415
during the year. The superintendent
holds this to mean that the population
of the city has remained stationary, and i
he argued that the population of the city i
is 337,000. . _
The finance committee recommended
that $90,000 be added to the estimate of
expenses made at the last meeting, the j
amount being to cover the deficit which
will be found at the close of the current ,
year. The recommendation was adopted. |
" The vacancy in the department of j
physics and chemistry caused by the
death of A. F. Coke was filled by the ;
appointment of L. A. Jordan of the \\ ash
ington Grammar School, he to take office ;
after the close of the vacation.
John R. Daniels was elected teacher of \
bookkeeping in the Business Evening j
School. M
On motion of Drucker all pupils < I the
Lowell and Polytechnic High Schools
who have enlisted will be granted diplo
mas if at the time of their enlistment
they were in fair standing.
The following assignments were made:
Miss Alice LTeese of the day substitute ;
class as a probationary teacher in the i
Hamilton Grammar School; Miss L. Rad- I
ford of the same class as a probationary
teacher in the Lincoln Grammar School; \
Miss E. G. Sullivan of the samt* class as
a probationary teacher in the Peabody
School; Miss R. Stack of the same class
as a probationary teacher in the Buena
Vista School; Miss M. A. Latham of the
same class as a probationary teacher in
the John Swett School.
Leave of absence was granted Mrs. M.
H. Melrose of the Dernal Heights School
from May 30, 18H8, to June 17,- IS9B.
Charles L. Turner of the Humboldt
Evening School was restored to class j
duty, the attendance of his class having
been restored to the proper standard!
Miss A. Kock of the evening substitute i
class was assigned to the Rlncon Evening ;
School and Miss R. Games "of the same I
class va? assigned to the Richmond
Evening School.
The following recommendations of the
examining board were adopted:
That a high school certificate be granted John
J. Schmit ; that a grammar grade certificate
be granted Mrs. Jlattir it. McDougall and to
J. A. Lenahhn; that a primary certificate be
granted Mrs. Florence Kelly. Miss Marie

A communication from Judge E. A.
Belcher asking that t.ie schools be closed
on Bunker Hill day was received, but It
was d( cjiled not to be expedient, as to
close the schools then would interfere
with many of the graduating exercises.
Mr. Head moved that ttachers' war
rants be made at once, and Mr. Waller
substituted a plan by which tradespeople
having claims against the board can got
in first. Should the teachers grot at the
treasury before the tradesmen there
would be no hope for those who furnished
supplies, for there would be no money
to pay them and none could be appro
priated next year. With the teachers,
however, It is different, so It was decided
that all persons having claims against
the School Department submit the same
on or before Monday. June 13, or the de
partment will not be responsible for their
payment. Those claims being in, the
teachers' warrants for May will be issued
at once.

LEES OUT,
KEENEY IN
The Commissioners Have at Last
Determined to Retire the
Senile Chief of Police.
HE HAS OUTLIVED HIS USEFULNESS.
July 5 the ex-Health Officer Will Leave His Patients
for the Pursuit of Criminalsâ Dr. Shumate to
Be Examining Police Surgeon.
Chief of Police I. W. Lees will
step down and out on or before
July 5, and Dr. James \Y.
Keener will succeed to the con
trol of the department.
This change was definitely and Irre
vocably settled at the meeting of the
Board of Police Commissioners one
week ago, when Messrs. Alvord and
Tobin reached an agreement that the
present Penile Chief should not lncum
ber the force another, minute after that
date.
The citizens of Pan Francisco will
probably arrange for an extraordinary
demonstration on the Fourth in joint
celebration of the nation's Wrthday
and the city's emancipation from Lees. I
The fight made by Lees against the i
inevitable has been long and desperate,
but decency has finally won. The man
of much gold lace and no ability was
slated to go last May, but he pleaded
with the Commissioners so hard and
earnestly to be allowed to remain until
he could reap the full benefits of the
pension law 'hat they allowed him to
remain.
But matters have reached such a
state that the board hap set July 5 for
Lees' abdl^ati'm. voluntarily if he
chooses, but forcibly if necefcsary. He
may be removed before then, for the
Commissioners are so thoroughly arous
ed over the disreputable condition into
which the Police Department has fal
len under Lees' imbecile regime that
last night there was a strong disposi
tion to terminate his official career at
once.
The matter was thoroughly discussed
and finally it was partially determined
to give him until the date of the annual
meeting, when superannuated members
of the force are retired, to resign; if he
falls to do so, he will be expelled.
One thing that has held Lees up so
long has been the inability of the Com
missioners to agree upon his successor.
At one jime Captain Wittman was seri
ously considered for the place, but
when his qualifications were thorough
ly canvassed, he was found to be so
totally unfitted for the position that he
was dropped and eventually Dr. Keeney
was decided upon.
One w<*ek ago the Commissioners met
and after the disposal of routine busi
ness the subject of Lees' dismissal was
taken up. The meeting might be termed
a secret session of an executive ses
sion, for while the board transacts all
Its business behind closed doors, after
the transaction of the regular affairs,
the secretary of the board was dis
missed and the meeting resolved itself
Into a secret conference between Com
missioners Alvord and Tobln, with
Chief Lees In attendance by virtue of
his ex-offlcio membership; Commis
sioner Gunst is absent from the city.
The meeting lasted nearly two
hours and the rhief stayed to the bit
ter end. Not to defend himself, for he
Is still capable of realizing that many
of his recent acts are indefensible, but
only to ward off the blow as long as
possible. Again he pleaded, as he had
pleaded one year ago, and the result of
his pleading was that he was plainly
told to be prepared for oblivion after
July 5. He was not even given posi
tive assurance that he would be al

Tried Cuticura. In Few Days
Better. In Short Time Cured.
Our little girl's humor commenced with a
tiny tor* on one nostril , but it kept on spread-
ing till we thought she would never get it
cured. For several weeks we tried every-
thing wo could got for the blood, both exter-
nally and internally, but It kept petting larger
all the time, till both nostrils, the upper lip, a
part of the lower lip,andup one side to the eye,
were a solid sore. We thought there was no
cure, and that she would be disfigured for life.
Finally (as a last resort) we tried Cuticuea
Remedies. We used a part of a bottle of the
COTICCIU Resolvent and nearly a box of
CuTicon-V (ointment), and followed the direc-
tions minutely. After a few days it began to
look better, and in a short time she was en-

that rendered him vulnerable.
For years Lees has bolstered himself
up on his past reputation; nowhere
could there be found a better illustra
tion of the street phrase, 'he's a has
been" than In Lees.
Dr. Keeney. -who will succeed Lees as
chief, Is one of the best known sur
geons of this city. He Is a stepson of
Commissioner Alvord. and is at present j
examining and consulting surgeon of i
the Police Department, with the rank
of sergeant, which fully qualifies him
for the position. Dr. Keeney is a grad- '<
uate of the Philadelphia Medical Col
lege and of Heidelberg. He spent sev
eral years In Bellevue Hospital, New
York, and -'forward was appointed ai
surgpon in the United States army.
His father was a chief surgeon In the
army, and at the time of his death was
medical purveyor of the Department of
the Pacific. Dr. Keeney has only re
cently returned from an extensive tour
of Inspection of Eastern Police Depart
ments and Prisons^
Dr. Thomas E. Shumate has been se
lected to succeed Dr. Keeney as In
spector of police, with the rank of ser
geant. Dr. Shumate Is one of the
younger physicians of this city, a grad
uate of Cooper Medical College and the
College of Pharmacy.
Probably no man of his years stands
higher in his profession than Dr. Shu
mate. By his unaided efforts he has
won the recognition and friendship of
the most prominent medical men in the
State.

GENERAL FUENTES LEAVES FOR
GUATEMALA.
During His Stay in This City He Es
tablished a Reputation as a
"Spender."
General Daniel Fuentes, who has been
residing in this city since the failure of
the rebellion which he, in company with
Prosper Morales, led apainst the late
President Barrloi of Guatemala, sailed
for the South America;! republic yester
day, leaving behind him a lung list of
creditors and several mourning (an
Upon his arrival in thin city some
twelve months ago the general secured
sumpt;io'.:s quarters at the Occidental
Hotel and proceeded to establish a repu
tation as a "spender." When all of his
available cash had been spent for wine
and carriages and all of the attendant al
lurements of th* tenderloin he cast about
him for some means whereby he might
replenish his exchequer. He dispatched
his secretary, one Yalladares, to Mexico,
where he claimed that $SOC'O was awaiting
his ordor. but neither the secretary nor
the money has since been seen.
Failing In this, the general had recourse
to his friends, and when they failed him
he established a credit and continued in
the enjoyment of an uninterrupted round
of pleasures and dissipations. When the
Italian Opera Company visited this city
he formed the acquaintance of one of the
prima donnas. Cleopatra de Viccint, and
upon her he lavished the wealth of his
southern affections and as much stray
cash as he could collect during the inter

parted he cast his eyes upon the presid

large department store. Â«â  young lady
whose mother is the proprietor of a lodg
ing house at the corner of Bush and
Stockton streets. With him to admire
was to love, and he immediately placed
his credit at the White House and other
fashionable down town stores at the dis
posal of the object of his affections.
But the end o;ime at last and the gen
eral found himself indebted to various
people In the total sum of about $2000. His
assets consisted of a heap of scented love
letters and an unpaid board bill of $800.
From the Salvadorian Consul, Dr. Cal
deron, and a few other friends he bor
rowed enough money to pay for a ticket
to Guatemala. To his creditors he gave
promissory notes and hl& tnanks for many
courtesies received at their hands. His
latest lady love was at the steamer yes
terday to wish him a prosperous voyage.
He declares his Intention to become a
candidate for the Presidency of Guate
mala, but those who claim to be in touch
with the affairs of the rebellious repub
lic say that he stands a better chance of
meeting the executioner than he does of
becoming President.
MARTIN KELLY
WAS NOT BELIEVED
SOME CAUSTIC COMMENT BY
JUSTICE COOK.
He Rules That the Politician Must
Pay Mrs. Mahoney the Amount
She Claims Is Due Her.
There Is evident satisfaction showing In
every line of Justice of the Peace Conk's
opinion In the case of Mrs. Mahoney
against Martin Kelly. He reduces to
lrgal verbiage the fact that he did not
beli.Â»vÂ«* any of Kelly's testimony in the
case, and there is no mistaking the pleas
ure he takes In making that fact of rec
ord.
The suit was brought by Mrs. Mahoney
to recover from Martin Kelly $130 which
she claimed she loaned him. His defense
was that he never borrowed any money
from her, and this statement reiterated
under oath was what the court did not
believe.
After commenting- very favorably on
the attitude and testimony of the plain-
tiff Justice Cook has this to. say about the
defendant:
The defendant on the other hand, with a
pronounced Jupiter Tonans' voice and manner,
and at the tame time hip position as a pow
erful political leader being affirmed, mopt un
equivocally denied the plaintiffs testimony.
I>'.*nlf-d that he had ever seen the money tes
tltWl to by plaintiff and her witnesses to have
been loaned to him. Denied that he ever ad
mittej that he had, as testified to by the wit
ness Cook, or that his conduct and talk as to
the claim In suit, had eve; t>een Inconsistent
with his pro.=oM denial thereof. Tet the man
ner and matter of ' defendant's testimony. In
spite of bta eminence as a leading politician, I
fln.l lias carried no conviction with It of Its
truth to my mind.
I am satisfied that the tnith 1b with the
plaintiff, and I find for her In the sum sued
!'â >!-. $1 â 'â 'â¢, find costs.
The case will be appealed.

Ladies of the Exchange

THE SECRET IS NOW OUT
INTERESTING GOSSIP AND A

Exclusive Recipes of Dainties and

Book Causes All the
Mischief.
The patronesses of the Woman's Ex
change have broken the record.
For nearly two months they kept a
secret and a little fight all to themselves,
: and they naturally felt so proud of their
i achievement and so sure of themselves
I that they relaxed their vigilanceâ the
i story is out.
â¢There Is a new superintendent at the
I exchange. Gossip has it that Mrs. M.
Merry was peremptorily discharged, but
! the board of directors declare the lady,
forced by 111 health, sent in her resigna
j tion, which was accepted.
This resignation, however, all admit,
i came jupt when the members of the ex
change were writhing under the publicity
given to pet recipes of theirs and which
were printed and strewn broadcast In a
baking powder cook book.
At the request of Mrs. Merry the ladles
had furnished her with some of their
favorite recipes, generously imagining the
patrons of the exchange were to enjoy
them, but the superintendent, laboring un
der business inspiration, exchanged them
for enough baking powder to raise the
foundation of the Post street Institution.
The cook book reveals many secrets,
and shows society loaders in entirely new
lights. It depicts Mrs. C. W. Crocker as j
a stanch adherent of the plebeian ginger
snap; tells of Mrs. Breyfogle's fondness
for "Maud S cake," and Mrs. Louis Ger
stle's excellence In producing "tomato :
eggs." Among the many recipes for ;

DISAPPOINTED
SALOON MEN
No More Licenses for
Resorts at the Camp.
THE PROPERTY-OWNERS WIN
PBOTEST OF RICHMOND RESI
DENTS GRANTED.
Since the Arrival of Troops at the
Racetrack Saloons Have Been
Springing Up Like
Mushrooms.
' The Police Commissioners arrived at
the conclusion last night that all the sa
loons necessary to quench. the thirsts of
the "boys in blue" encamped on the old
Bay District race track and their visit
ors are now In operation. That decision
proved a bitter disappointment to nine
ambitious saloon men who hoped to be
granted licenses to dispose of "sharp
steams" . and stronger liquid refresh
ments to the soldiers and the thousands
of people who dally find their way to the
camp ground.
The residents of the Richmond district
made the fight and won a substantial
victory. Since the first arrival of troops
at the old race track saloons have been
popping up in that locality like mush-;
rooms. In the small strip of territory
bounded by Fulton and Clement streets, I
Henderson and Eighth avenues, there are j
31 saloons now running, and no less than j
nine applications for saloon licenses were
made before the Commissioners within
the past five days. The people of Rich- j
mond then decided that It was time for i
them to enter a strong and vigorous pro
test. When they received information
that dance halls and gambling dens were
also proposed tney thought that patience
had ceased to be a virtue, and that unless
some prompt and vigorous action was
taken thÂ© Richmond district in the neigh
borhood of the camp would soon become
a second edition of the Barbary Coast. A
few of the property owners met on Sun- I
day and drafted the following protest. |
which was signed by 24." residents, and j
filed with the Police Commissioners:
"We, the undersigned residents of the Rich- |
mond district, view with alarm the rapid prog-- I
ress of vice In our community, due to the pres
ence of so many licensed houses where liquor
is' sold, and they are increasing to such an
extent that the moral character of our young
people is thereby endangered. We also know
that there is an application before the Board i
of Police Commissioners for a license for an I
"officers' club," in the lower flat of 1424 Point
Lobos avenue. | From the nature of the furni
ture, etc., we have good reason to believe it
Is to be used for the purpose of gambling. We
are also Informed by the agent of the new
Richmond Hall, at the corner of Clement street
and Fourth avenue, that he considered rent
ing, the place for a dance hall with all its
usual accessories.
We hereby protest against the granting of
any more licenses to saloons or dance hall* in â¢
Richmond district, and we also request your
honorable body to look well into the nature ot j
the so-called . "officers' club" before granting
a permit.
In anticipation of the saloon men mak- :
Ing a fight to secure the licenses a com
mittee of ten of the property-owners at
Richmond presented themselves at the
rooms of the commission last night to en
ter protest against the applications being
granted. They were not called upon, :
however, for after an executive session
lasting about half an hour the Commis
sioners instructed Clerk Wright to an
nounce that under no circumstances would
any more licenses to sell liquor be granted .
to people Intending: opening saloons In the ,
neighborhood of the camp.
The applications denied last night were
from the following . saloon men, who
hoped to engage. in business at the loca
tions opposite their .names: Purcell & '
Rashow, 1421 Point I.obos road; Nelson &
Messerschmidt, 811 Point Lobos road; ,
Cornelius Krame, 1421 Point Lobos road;
Jacob D. Halst. 1313 Point Lobos road; .
John J. McCarthy, First avenue and Turk
street; Richard F. MeMahon, Fourth ave
nue and Clement street; John Ehlers,
First and Golden Gate avenues, and Al
bert Farenbach, 713 Fifth avenue.
After disposing of the saloon question '
the Commissioners took up the trial of I
the charges against live patrolmen ac- >
cused of neglect of. duty. Policeman
Sandman, accused of failing to properly
patrol the crossing of Market and
Kcarny streets, was acquitted. Policeman
John M. O'Connor, a new appointee,
Henry D. Jackson and George Eastman
were found guilty of having failed to re- !
port, for duty on time and were fined 120,
$10 and $10 respectively. Patrolman Felix ;
F. Dougherty pleaded guilty to a charge
of having gone asleep while on special :
duty watching the Union Iron Works
property to prevent the possibility of j
Spanish spies doing damage to the plant, i
and was fined $50. He would have been j â¢
dismissed from the department had It not
been shown that for several nights prior
to- his dereliction he had been sitting up
attending his wife, who was seriously ill.
