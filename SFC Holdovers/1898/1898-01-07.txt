GREAT BRITAIN
AGAINST RUSSIA
LONDON, Jan. 7.â According
to a special dispatch from
Shanghai, Russia is endeavoring
to obtain terms similar to Ger
many's for the occupation of
Port Arthur and the Kiaotong
Peninsula from a point consid
erably north of Talien-Wan. It
is believed the attitude of Eng
land and Japan will frustrate
her designs.
The Hongkong correspondent
of the Daily Chronicle says:
"The Russian occupation of
Port Arthur completely blocks
the entrance to Peking, and it
is imperative that the court
phould be transferred to Nan
kin, the southern capital.
LONDON. Jan. 6.â According to a
special dispatch from Shanghai the ex
istence of an Anglo-Japanese alliance
is openly asserted there in well inform
ed quarters, an alliance to maintain the
Ptatus quo In China and Korea, and to
declare the independence of Korea, un
der the Joint guarantee of England,
Russia and Japan.
The Dally Graphic publishes a dis
patch from Baron Hayshl Tadsou,
Japanese Embassador to Russia, to the
Japanese Government, intimating on
the authority of the German Embassa
dor at St. Petersburg, Prince yon Ra
dolln, that no understanding existed
between Germany and Russia with
reference to the occupation of Kiao
â  chau.
' PORT SAID. Jan. 6.â The Russian
cruiser, Rossia, has arrived here on
her way to China-
SECRETARY SHERMAN
SAYS THE RUSSIANS
WILL TAKE A PORT.
The Czar Must Follow fhe Pace Set by the
Kaiser in the Raid Upon
China.
Â° " ..NEW YORK, Jan. The Herald's
;'â  -"Washington correspondent sends the
/.'following: Minister Denby, at Peking,
â  â .â ;â . lias officially notified the Department
}: of State that the controversy between
Germany and China has been settled
/â¢ by the lease of Klaochau to the former
'" '.â : government for a term of fifty years.
:'â  '. The effect of the lease on American
: ! .- 'commercial interests -will be consid

'";â  row. So far as I am able to learn,
: -Mr. Denby makes no mention of any
â¢-: -.i'.riroviFion in the lease that Germany
: "-i. 'â 'will be .allowed to take possession of
â¢ V any port in China In case Kiaochau is
" ".-found unsuitable for her purposes.
:'â¢:.;' "I think It will now be in line for
â .'â¢'â¢â " Russia and France to take possession
Â° of Chinese ports," said Secretary
Sherman to me to-night. "Their in
f terests will require Buch action. Great
';.. Britain has Hongkong, which Is a seat
I for- English Interests, and no^v Gw
many has Kiaochau. Russia Is desir
ous of obtaining a southern port, where
Â = her ships will not be frozen in during
c Â°< winter. Besides her commercial in
, V terests are such that she ought to have
a Chinese port, such as Germany has
obtained.
"So far as American commerce Is
concerned, I expect It will have the
same rights in Kiaochau as that of
Germany. This depends, however, on
the commercial regulations which Ger
many will place in force. From my
understanding of the matter, Germany
.. is not given a title to the territory, but
she has the right to substitute her
laws for those which the Chinese have
hitherto had in force. Her merchants
will, consequently, not be subject to
the laws of China at Kiaochau, but
will be required to observe German
laws. I presume the Germans will now
establish a large city at Kiaochau and
push their commercial Interests as vig
" - orously as possible. I suppose if the
â ;Â°, United States were to indicate to China
â¢ â¢ââ¢ its desire to obtain a Chinese port the
â o. government would be willing to grant
â  .â ;'--4t." But we want no such port. Our
,;.â â¢.'â¢ txpmmereial Interests are satisfactorily
c". : protected at the present time by treat
"" ; " ies, .and besides, at Hongkong, and we
â  will probably have the same rights at
I I ' Kiaochau, we are granted the freedom
â oÂ£ the port in the same way as are the
:?â¢ English."
The Chinese Minister, Wu Ting Fang,
tokJ me to-nipht that he had received
no-dispatches from his Government re
garding the settlement of affairs.
While the Minister naturally regrets
that China was compelled to lease to
Germany the territory of Ki&oohau
The San Francisco Call
Bay, he was not disposed to discuss
the matter for publication. An at
tache of the legation with whom I
talked expressed great surprise at Rus
sia's failure to interfere in the matter.
â¢'Of course, it is well understood," he
continued, "that China appealed to
Russia for assistance immediately
after Germany had landed at Kiaochau
and It was believed the Czar would
give the aid asked. It is evident, how
ever, that Russia raised no objection In
the first place to the seizure of Kiao
chau by the Germans, else they prob
ably would not have continued in pos
session of the territory."
It is believed at the Chinese Legation
that Russia will withdraw her ships
from Port Arthur in the spring. In
view of the action of Germany in re
taining Kiaochau it is thought in State
Department circles that Russia may take
possession of Port Arthur with ;i
view to establishing at that point not
only a naval station but the terminus
for her trans-Siberian road and a
commercial port for her people. It is
expected Japan will withdraw from
Wei-Hai-Wei when the Chinese war
indemnity is paid, but such withdraw
al, it is thought, will be taken advan
tage of by Great Britain, which will
seize it and have Joint control with
Russia of the entrance to the Gulf of
Pechili.
German diplomats here are delighted
with what they term the triumph, for
Gr-rmari diplomacy. It is now believed
that the departure of Prince Henry
with a naval force to the Asiatic sta
tion, after a theatrical farewell with
the German Emperor, was a bluff de
signed to impress China and the Reich
stag, the latter with a view of getting
the appropriation for increasing the
naval establishment asked for by the
Kaiser.
GERMANY IS JUBILANT
AT WILLIAM'S SUCCESS
IN GETTING A PORT.
There Is an Under Note of Belief to the
Effect That Possibly Somebody Has
Blundered.
LONDON. Jan. 7.â The Times this
morning says that it understands the
term of Germany's lease of Kiaochau
to be ninety-nine instead of fifty years.
A dispatch to the Times from Peking
dated Thursday says: Under the
agreement between Baron Helking,
German Embassador to China, and
Prince Kung, President of the Tsung-
Li-Yamen, Germany will pay a nominal
annual rental for Kiaochau. She ac
quires the right to begin forthwith the
construction of a dock and a fortified
coaling station. The belief In an early

SAX FRANCISCO, FRIDAY, JANUARY 7, 1898.
ARRESTED
AS A COMMON
COUNTERFEITER
Professor Dudley in
a Most Peculiar
Predicament.
Accusedof Having Freely
Circulated Spurious
Money.
Held in Heavy Bail to Meet the
Charge of Passing Bad
$1O Pieces.
THERE MUST BE A MISTAKE
Fellow-Instructors at Stanford Uni
versity Certain That Such Is
the Case.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PALO ALTO. Cal., Jan. 6.â
Professor William Russell Dud
ley, who has been arrested for
passing counterfeit money at
"Watsonville. is head of the De
partment of Systematic Botany
at Stanford University, and Is
one of the best-known botan
ists in this country. He came
to Stanford from Cornell Uni
versity, where he taught bot
any as an instructor and an as
sistant professor for twenty
years, from 1872 to 1892. He was
a class-mate at Cornell of Dr.
â¢ , of Dr. John Caspar
Brenner, head of the Depart
ment of Geology, and of Pm
fessor M"!ville B. Anderson,
head of the English department.
He received his B. S. degree
at Cornell in 1874 and his If. S.
in 1576. lie went to Harvard
University for advanced work
in 1876 and finished his course
at the universities of Stras
burg and Berlin.
ProfessoT Dudley Is one of the
most popular members of the
faculty. He is quite retiring, a
thorough gentleman, upright
and of great integrity. The
members of the faculty who
know Professor Dudley best,
while theysympathiz? "v'th him
on account of the distressing
pdattion in which he has been
placed, cannot repress a smile
at the absurdity of the charge
brought against him.
PAXTA CRT'Z. Jan. 6.â Professor
"William Russell Dudley was arrested
at Watsonville this afternoon by Con
stable Pratt of Capitola, charged with
passing counterfeit $10 gold pieces, but
he was not caught in the act. Some of
the coins were passed in this city and
at BoqueJ and Capitola. About two weeks
ago a counterfeiter succeeded In drop
ping a number of them in the several
places. Some of the coins ought to
have been detected by their mere ap
pearance, and it is wonderful that any
body could have been deceived by
thnn. Sheriff Resse and his deputies
and other officers had been on the
lookout for the offender since he oper
ated here, and Constable Pratt hav
ing an accurate description of the man
saw Dudley at Capitola and followed
him to Watsonvtlle. where he had gone
by train. He has been Identified by two
or three of the victims, though if the
same man he has shaved off his beard.
In his possession when examined at
the jail here were found cards bearing
the names of "Mr. William Russell
Dudley** ami "Mrs. "William Russell
Dudley." The latter had black bor
ders such as are used by ladies in
mourning. Among his effects was a
complete set of maps showing the
farms and roads In all this section of
country. The known roads were
marked In red, and the construction
of the maps Indicated that they were
for the jrorpose of guiding a traveler.
He carries also a pocket compass and
a pocket razor.
The counterfeiter, whether Dudley
or not, had evidently been aided In his
work by two other men, who have not
yet been caught. When arrested Dud
ley had $5 In gold and $2 16 in silver,
all genuine. He says he Is a professor
at Palo Alto, making $3000 a year, and
was on his way there when arrested.
His ticket was to that point. He is
tall, of middle age and of quiet de
meanor, intelligent and rather uncom
municative, though perfectly at ease.
He was arrested on a warrant issued
by Justice Boyle of Sequel, placing
bail at Jf.ooo. He will have a prelim
inary hearing on Monday next.
THERE IS A GENERAL
EXODUS FROM THE PLAGUE.
Within Forty-Eight Hours at Bombay 105

by a Federal Court

Vice Suppressor. :
METHODS OF THE AGENT.
Compelled to Admit In Court That
He Has Written Latter* to

6peclal DUpatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Jan. 6. â "A notorious
blackmailer" Dr. Montague R. Lever
son admitted having called Anthony
Comstock, of the Society for the Sup
pression of Vice, and a jury In the
United Btatps Circuit Court to-day de-
elded that Oomstoek's reputation and
charactor had been damaged to the
extent of C, cents. This verdict does
not entitle him to costs. He had sued
for $50,000 damages for defamation of
character.
Comstock appoared In court early.
He was aconmpauled by one of his
agents and several substantial appear
ing: old gentlemen. Dr. L,everson sot to
court early, too. He. too, was aemm
panled by a number of old gentlemen.
The first thing Mr. Comstock testified
to was that â when Dr. Leverson had
made his rude remarks, he (Comstock)
had said to the doctor that If he had
any evidence tn back up what he said
he (Cnmptnok> would like to have him
put it in writing.
"Didn't you go where he was to have
an altercation with him?"
"I did not. I thought he -was a gen
tleman." The remarks complained of
by both sides wore made in a railroad
station in Albany.
"â¢And dldrTt y.vj pr< To T> . I_."verÂ»rÂ»n
for the purpose of stirring him up and
getting him to say something upon
which you could sue him?" asked Dr.
Leverson's lawyer.
"I did not," answered Comstock.
"And haven't you for twenty-fly*Â»
years being Inciting people to commit
crime?"
"In my capacity as postofflce In
spector I have written 'test letters'
which have been approved by the Su
preme Court and â "
"Now," Interrupted Judere. Lacombe.
who is a very patient man, "you are
not called upon to go into all that."
"Tell me." continuM the lawyer,
"have you not been writing letters for
the purpose of inducing people to com
mit crime?"
"I have not." said Comstr>"k prompt
ly. Then it came out that when Com-
Btock had approached Dr. Leverson in
the Albany depot Dr. Leverson said to
him, "Go away. How dare you speak
to me? Go away and leave me alone."
Comstock didn't go away, and so Dr.
Leverson called a policeman. Com
stoek said that when Dr. Leverson had
referred to him as a blackmailer he
(Comstock) had asked the policeman
to arrest Dr. Leverson. The. policeman
did so.
"Because," as Comstock explained,
"as soon as the doctor had told me to
pr> away from him he also turned to
a crowd and said, "Ladies and gentle
men, this is Anthony Comstock, the
notorious blackmailer, etc' ".
"Now, Mr. Comstock," asked Lawyer
Pierce, as he shook* a letter at the
witness, "did you write to Dr. Park
over the name of Annie E. Ray?"
ThiÃ made considerable legal dis
turbance, which was increased when
Mr. Pieroe continued: "Isn't it a fact
that you have written letters In the
name of young girls, stating that you
were burdened with disgrace and
pleading with doctors to whom they
were addressed 'For God's sake' to
send them something . to save them
from disgrace for life?"
This interesting line of Inquiry waa
blocked by Judge Lacombe, who re
fused to permit such questions to be
put to the witness. That ended the
case, except for the summing up, after
which Judge J^aeombe charged the
Jury that, the alleged scandalous lan
guage not being denied, the only ques
tions to be considered in deciding the
suit was provocation or malice and the
amount of damage done to Comstock's
character and reputation.
The Jury came in with a verdict of
6 cents in favor of Comstock.
PROVIDES FOR HEW
REVENUE SERVICE VESSELS.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 6.â Senator
Frye to-day Introduced a bill author
izing the Secretary of the Treasury to
have eight vessels constructed for the
uee of the revenue cutter service, four
of them to cost 1160,000 each and one of
them to cost $250,000. and the other
three $45,000 each. The first four are
to be used in replacing the Seward, the
McLean, the Colfax and the Boutwell
and the last three In replacing the
Washington at Philadelphia harbor;
the Hamlin, at Boston harl>or, and the
Chandler, at New York harbor. The
J2F>O.OOO vessel is to be used at the Col
umbia River bar. on^he Pacific ('oast.
The bill was Introduced at the instance
of the Treasury Department. The old
vessels to be replaced are complained
of as obsolete and unfit for the service
required.

DEATH NOW DONE;

TO-DAY THE
ROPE WILL
END IT ALL
Governor Budd De
clares He Will Not
Interfere.
Courts Have Closed Their
Doors to Any Further
Technicalities.
All Hope Has Gone From the
Prisoner and He Is Weak
ening Fast.
HE PRAYS CONTINUALLY.
Defeated on All Sides, There Is Noth
ing Left for the Condemned Man
but the Scaffold.
The merry chase Durrant has led the
grim avenger of the belfry murder is
nearly done.
The legal fabric that has taken so
long to build, has worried courts and
Judges and public for years and has led
the case from one end of the country
to the other, is tumbling like a house
of cards, and this morning will see the
end.
The Governor has refused to inter
fere. The United States Circuit Court
will hear no more motions, file no more
papers and issue no more writs. The
Supreme Justices in Washington will
stay no process of the State courts,
and under the woipht of all his fail
ures the condemned man writhes in his
cell and calls aloud in his anguish.
He has spoken to the press, but his
words were well weighed and threw
no light upon the happenings of that
April back in 1595. He has seen his
friends for the last time, and he knows
his end is near.
The gallows has been tried, the
noose tested and the trap sprung. The
executioners have been appointed and
all the grewsome arrangements are
completed.
The last day's struggle was marked
only by disaster.
In the morning Deuprey appeared
before the United States Circuit Court,
and, presenting a bill of exceptions,
asked that it be signed. Judges Mor
row and De Haven took the matter
under advisement, and after carefully
considering the effect the signing of
the bill would have upon the case, they
decided to allow the request and they
signed the bill, after examining it
thoroughly to see that all was in legal
form.
Mr. Deuprey's spirits rope at once.
Having had the bill safely signed he
prepared a notice of appeal and then,
with a certified copy of the bill of ex
ceptions, he started for San Quentin
and served both papers on the Warden.
Then in the afternoon a formal appeal
from the decision of Wednesday was
offered to the clerk of the Circuit Court
for filing, but he refused to have any
thing to dn with them. They were
left on the clerk's desk, however, and
Deuprey says if they were not filed it
is no fault of his; they were offered
and should have been filed. The mere
fact of the offer of the papers, he says,
constituted an appeal, and he is hon
estly certain that at this time Dur
rant has a valid appeal pending In the
United States Supreme Court.
THE NORTHWEST WING, WHERE THE GALLOWS STANDS.
WORDS THAT SHATTERED
DURRANT'S LAST HOPE
Hon. W. E. Hale. Warden San Quentln State Prison. San Quentin, Cal.
Dear Sir : I have carefully considered the papers which were served upon
you by the counsel for W. H. T. Durrant and submitted by you to me, and
which purport to be a bill of exceptions of the proceedings had In the
United States Circuit Court on the 4th and sth inst. From this bill of ex
ceptions it appears that an application was made to the United States Cir
cuit Court for a writ of habeas corpus; that the application was denied
and the petition dismissed; that the counsel for the petitioner then filed
and presented to the court a petition for an order allowing an appeal from
the order denying the writ, which petition was denied; that the counsel
for petitioner then requested that a citation upon the appeal petitioned for
be signed, which request was denied; that the said counsel then requested
the court to fix the amount of a bond to be given upon the appeal peti
tioned for and offered to the court a bond and asked the court to approve
the same In an amount to be fixed, which request was denied; to all of
which rulings counsel took an exception, and the entire matter is Incor
porated In and constitutes the bill of exceptions so served upon you.
In reply to your Inquiry as to whether or not this will in any manner
operate to stay the execution of Durrant, I desire to say that it is obvious
from this bill of exceptions that the Circuit Court refused to allow the ap
peal; that In the opinion of Judge de Haven in this matter, sitting with
Judge Morrow as a Circuit Judge, he expressly held that it was within the
discretion of the court to refuse to allow an appeal, and that where no ap
peal was expressly allowed there is no appeal pending within the meaning
of the provisions of section 766 of the Revised Statutes of the United States,
and that this opinion of course controls.
The alleged bond on appeal and the alleged notice of appeal and the
notice from the attorneys, which were served upon you by counsel for
Durrant, do not In any respect affect what I have already said. Respect
fully, W. F. FITZGERALD, Attorney-General.
fully.
On the same boat that Mr. Deuprey
took from San Quentin came the War
den. He was worried about the legal
status of the papers which had been so
vigorously served upon him, and he
wished to see and consult the Attorney-
General on the proper course to pursue.
The Warden was closeted with the At
torney-General for over an hour, and
the result of the consultation was an
opinion by the Attorney-General which
set forth that the so-called appeal was
of no effect whatever, and that there
was no legal reason why the execution
should not proceed at the time set by
the court. ,
At 2 o'clock yesterday afternoon the
Governor made public the fact that he
Jiad ayain decided to let the law take
its course. His decision was the mere
announcement that he would not inter
fere, for he said he had gone over the
case before and he saw nothing in this
new application to lead him to an opin
ion different from that which he had
held in the previous applications.
The decision of the Governor was not
much of a surprise, for even the most
hopeful had expected nothing else. The
Governor had made no previous an-
nouncement of his purpose to not in
terfere, nor did he Inform the Warden
of it until late yesterday afternoon.
The first person to visit the doomed
man yesterday was Captain Edgar,
who remained chatting with him for
a quarter of an hour. No mention was
made of the approaching execution nor
was any phase of Durrant's affairs al
luded to. The condemned man knew
that Deuprey was to go before the Cir
cuit Court again to-day in a last ef
fort to stay his fate, but said nothing
either as to his hopes or doubts.
He struggled to discourse about every
thing save what was uppermost in his
mind, and preserved to the close of the
interview a calm demeanor, although
the despair and agony with which he
is tortured showed all too plainly in
his haggard countenance and restless
mannerisms. As the captain was about
to withdraw Durrant asked him if he
svould not furnish a few envelopes for
messages he wished to write to his
friends. These the captain procured
for him and soon afterward he wrote,
sealed and addressed several notes
which he kept until he could give them
to his mother for delivery. Then he
threw himself on the mattress in a
state of collapse.
Partly recovering from this an hour
later he tried to Interest himself In the
Bible and religious works from which
he professed to extract comfort. His

keen-sighted guards, who follow his
every movement, noted that he was
nervous and distracted, and evidently
saw only the white of the pages he list
lessly turned.
Ever since the conviction dawned on
him that his lawyers had exhausted
the resources of their legal quibbles he
has grown rapidly weaker of nerve
until his guards have come to the be
lief thnt he will go entirely to pieces
when he is confronted with the gal
lows.
From all accounts only the most
meager idea of his state of mind has
reached the outer world, as his guards
are cautioned to silence as to what oc
curs in the doath changer and decline
to give more than inklings of the par
oxysyms of rage and grief he has suf
fered the few days past, and more par
ticularly since the decision of the Cir
cuit Court respecting the last habeas
corpus petition reached him. It Is
learned from an authority in official
communication with the guards that
he is living a dual character.
When a visitor is announced he
braces up and seems to be the Dur
rant of the Blanche Lamont trial and
the subsequent court ordeal through
which he passed so cold bloodedly. He
takes care, however, to avoid reference
to the black Friday ahead, and con
fines his conversation almost wholly to
religious subjects and trifling remin
iscences of childhood. When the vis
itor departs he relapses into a pitiable
condition, alternately weeping, groan
ing and raving at the courts and news
papers. Then will come a period of
prostration, when he lies on the floor,
groveling for a quarter of an hour at
a spell.
Durrant took no hope from the ap
pearance later in the day of Deuprey,
who came accompanied by United
States Marshal Baldwin to serve no
tice on Warden Hale of the filing in the
Circuit Court of the bill of exceptions
and to assert that under this action of
the court Durrant could not be execut
ed to-morrow. The Warden posted off
to San Francisco with all dispatch to
consult Attorney General Fitzgerald.
During his absence J. A. Spencer, the
executioner of Folsom Prison, arrived,
and together with Amos Lunt, the
hangman of San Quentin, made a final
test of the death rope. It was found
in proper condition.
The fall provided for Durrant is
seven feet.
About the same time Prison Chap
lain Drahms called on Durrant to offer
him religious consolation. Shortly
after the two men began praying Dur
rant burst into tears. This spell lasted
for five minutes, after which he re
gained composure.
The chaplain left him apparently in2
a quiet state of mind, but a few min
utes later he was prone again on tne
m \Vhen S 'warden Hale returned from
San Francisco he was fully armed witn
legal authority to proceed with the ex
ecution of Durrant in accordance with
the sentence pronounced by Judge
Bahrs. He filed the opinion given him
by the Attorney General advising him
to proceed, in the prison records.
The Warden is entirely satisfied as
to the performance of his duty.
TRUSTS IN THE LORD.
Durrant Interviewed, but His
Words Were Valuable.
"I am prepared to die. I rely on God;
my faith sustains me; I will die
bravely."
Theodore Durrant was speaking
from his cell, a cell covered
with wire lest somebody reach
him and place in his hands the j
means of cheating the gallows.
Yet his voice was firm. As he talked j
two guards stood silent and grim be- j
Bide him. Two more just without. His
mother sat in -,i low rocking chair
close to the screen where she had sat |
for hours, and every moment keen j
.>. atched her. The father had
gone, leaving the woman there as if
to set a seal upon the lips of the
.. d. At times, by a word of warn
ing, she would check him, ever alert
to avoid a damaging admission.
"I am not afraid to die," continued
the slayer "f Blanche Lament and j
Minnie 'Williams, looking at the strong j
white fingers that had stified the girls 1 I
cries for mercy.
â¢â¢It is ma awful to go to such a
death. Such a death as mine may be
the means of abolishing capital pun
ishment in this State."
â¢Yes it will be a grand death, Theo;
think how Jesus died." The mother
haa spoken.
"I have been accustomed to remun
eration." the prisoner went on, "when
talking for publication."
"Yes, anything- Theo says now is of
great value." The mother had spoken
again.
On the scaffold I shall proclaim my
innocence to the world; that is all:
proclaim it loudly. I thank God that
no blood is upon me. But this seal of
California you can Bay it is placing up
on itself a blot in murdering a guilt
less man, or rather a guiltless boy.
"I am not afraid. It is painful to
leave father and mother this way, but
I am going to a better life. The body
descends, but the spirit ascends. I am
going where there shall be no more
sorrow. I never knew the sustaining
power of laith until in my troubles. I ,
nave Leaned on Christ and in him;
: strength.
"Theo," interrupted the mother, "you
have Baid enough."
No price had been offered; why
sh<uld precious time be wasted?
H;-r attention was drawn to the door,
and after a pause he went on: "I have
no physical fear, and there is no dia
grace in going to the gallows when I i
go with no stain on my soul and cer- :
tain that sooner or later the truth will
be known."
Occasionally the mother wept, rock- j
ing in her chair. At the mention of |
death she shed tears, and when the be
lief that Theo was to die a martyr was
mentioned by him her feelings again
overcame her. But the humane heart, â 
naturally touched by a mother's woe,
felt its impulses blighted when be- '
tween paroxysms the mother bethought ;
herself that the words of her son were :
worth money.
Durrant would not discuss any spec- !
ial phase of his case, nor mention more '
ti an his emotions, and his confidence
that one day his name would be ;
cleared. He avoided mention of his
desire that his body be not even so !
much as gazed upon by stranger eyes,
and harped upon the one theme that
the State was about to murder him,
and that he was a willing sacrifice for
the good his fate might do in saving
future assassins from the rope. He
was willing to talk indefinitely upon
the faith which buoyed him up. upon
his assurance of bliss, and if he showed
an inclination to wander from this line !
of thought his mother quickly checked ;
him.
"Theo," she would say firmly, "you
have talked enough."
It seems almost brutal to relate the
unavoidable conclusion. In an apart
ment but a few feet away stood the
gallows which awaited her son. Upon
her ten fingers she could have counted
ten hours to intervene before he should
dangle there, dead, forfeit to the law
so outraged and so long defied. Yet
she was the stronger of the two, her
will controlled, she gave to the inter
view its tone, and the tone was mer
cenary. Sitting beside her son, she
seemed to alternate between mourning
for him and planning how to coin dol
lars from his blood, a shocking and ap
palling thing. A realization of it added
to the ghastliness of the place, seemed
to chill the air, and to make the spot
uncanny.
Durrant moved uneasily. There was
nothing more to say. He had declared
his innocence, his faith, his martyr
dom. His mother wished him to say
no more.
A lady was in waiting to be told these
same things and others, the others be
ing in the estimation of some, worth
a price.
"Good night," said the visitor. "Good
bye," said Durrant, no quaver in his
voice. The interview was at an end.
The lady who had been waiting stepped
to the cage. She was there until the
mother went away, and accompanied
her.
â¢ Why did his mother stay after the
father had gone," was a question asked
among the curious at the door.
"Because she was afraid that Dur
rant, if left alone, would break down
and confess," was the usual answer.
Durrant manifested no desire to
avoid receiving company. In fact, he
was relieved at a chance to deaden
realization of the awful fact that he
was spending his last night on earth.
But while he talked freely, it was to
reiterate his innocence. He admitted
that he had given up all hope; noth
ing more. In the presence of visitors
he showed no sign of weakness. His
real aspect, however, could only be de
tected by a scrutiny made difficult by
the wire screen.
Looking intently, one could see that
his eyes were red, his face pallid and
drawn, and resting over eyes and face
like a shadow an expression of utter
despair. His seeming confidence was
that of the actor keyed up to his part.
Behind his boasts was the stimulus of
fear. He was as if the ghosts of mur
dered prirls haunted his memory and
he had essayed to drive them away by
the hollow tones of a bravery he did
not feel. He could talk while his
mother was there to guide him and
she guided htm to discretion.
But will he never tell the dreadful
story so far concealed? There is yet
time. Before he reaches the foot of the
gallows he will have to face the situa
tion friendless alone; the secret strug
gling to his lips, and he about to meet
hiS CrOll.
When asked by a representative of
the Associated Press what he had to
say he replied: "It was a great sur
prise, but I am prepared for It."
"How do you feel?"
"Hopeful, buoyant and ready to meet
my Maker. I know the Lord Is with
me. No one knows what faith is until
It Is tried. lam going to a judge who
has never committed a wrong and who
cannot. My faith has been so strong
that I have been kept up and will be
sustained to the end."
Then, turning to his mother, he said:
"Mother, I have come to the conclusion
that it needs trial to know God."
"And you may say that to the
world," he added.
A sudden thought seemed to strike
LOUIS P. BOARDMAN, OF DURRANT'S COUNSEL.
Durrant. for he added in a voice dif
ferent from the earnest religious ac
cents of his previous remarks: "I have
had offers of remuneration for a talk
with me from the East. Have had
three or four telegrams ."
His mother Interrupted with "All of
his words are of great value."
No offer of compensation being
â made. Durrant was promptly cau
tioned to talk no more. He was will
ing to comply, but his mother being
called away a moment he resumed in
his former strain.
"I will make no reference to the
past. All will be made clear, if not in
this world then in the next. I feel that
I am perfect in Christ."
"\\ hat will you say at the last?" was
a rather difficult question to ask, but
the answer was quick and in firmer
voice than he had been using.
"I shall only proclaim my innocence â
loudly â strenuously. Make this as
strong as you please. I thank God my
hands are clean, not stained with
blood, but the fair name of California
will stand stained with a crime that
can never be wiped out â the blood of
an innocent man."
At th ; s point Mrs. Durrant returned
to the side of her son, and said rather
sharply: "There, you have said
enough. Theodore; too much already, I
am afraid."
"I will not falter at the end. I -will
die bravely, knowing I am going to a
better world. That's all, mother," sub
missively replied the condemned mur
derer, as he said good by and turned
his head away.
A JOURNALISTIC PASTOR.
He Comes in the Gospel's Guise
to Serve the Fleshly World.
SAN QUENTIN, Jan. Iâ When Mr.
and Mrs. Durrant arrived at the
prison at about 7 o'clock, having come
in a hack from Pan Rafael, they were
accompanied by Parson Davis of Oak
land, his pretended mission 'being to
offer spiritual consolation to the con
demned and incidentally, as was gen
erally supposed, to gather such infor
mation as might be useful to a morning
paper of unscrupulous methods. He
was inside for an hour or more, and
when his fat face appeared again it
was pale and pasty.
He was at once besought to tell of
his interview, no real newspaper men
having then had access to the con-
I demned. Before the worthy parson
i could reply he was caught by a gang
I of ruffians, among them at least two
prizefighters, and hustled into the wait
ing hack. The father of the pris
oner was with Davis, and a reporter
of the paper had been concealed In the
hack.
Mr. Durrant during the brief scene
exclaimed, "Have you no respect for a
minister of the gospel?"
Nobody responded in the affirmative,
[ but Davis, with his silk hat awry and
I his face paler and pastier than evei ,
I rolled from the prison door. The
j prize fighters exchanged congratula
tions, but over what did not appear,
as there was nothing gained by tneir
I display of ruffianism, the arrangement
being that If the representative of one
! paper should be admitted all the other
1 papers should be similarly favored,
and this was fully carried out, no
morning paper being denied.
Immediately upon returning from
In Francisco, after having been in
ucted by the Attorney General to
>ceed with the hanging. Warden
ile announced that Durrant might
â  one representative in turn from
-h dally newspaper. Durrant had
pressed a desire to talk to the re
rters on the previous evening, but
i Warden had declined to grant them
mission because of the especial re
est of General Dickinson that none
be allowed to talk with him. With the
decision of the Attorney General that
KÂ» execution was not stayed by the
1 of exceptions filed In the Superior
urt, he further advised that Durrant
should be permitted to meet to-night
such reporters as he desired to inter
view him.
It was thought at first that fair play
in this respect would be rendered im
possible by the unscrupulous methods
common to the San Francisco newspa
per that has been contributing so much
maudlin and hysterical literature to
the revolting features of this case.
At the first break the Journalistic
minister and his backers made to reach
Durrant, objection was made on the
ground that the so-called minister of
the gospel was in reality serving as a
Iwspaper reporter in disguise. The
arge was justified by the assertion
one of the men having him in
arge. made to a friend who tried to
sit him at the headquarters of this
grading conspiracy. "You can't see
him: we have him under contract."
Upon having the design brought to
their attention the prison officials in
sisted that the new spiritual adviser
should have no special newspaper priv
ileges, and that if he was taken to
Durrant any other reporters whom
the condemned man desired to see
should be admitted to the screen. Fi
nally the Durrants, taking alarm at
I the tempest raised, for all the other
newspaper representatives had com
t bined in protest, agreed that a reprc
[ sentative of each newspaper should be
; granted an audience.
Mrs. Durrant staid with her son un
til after the last interviewer had de
parted, coaching him throughout. She
i left the jail at 11:22 and Durrant im
: mediately after she had gone threw
himself on the couch to sleep and
j dream of the morrow.
The latest word received privately
from the death chamber tells thnt he

remained with him at the outside of j
the cell screen until a late hour and i
etood by to keep him resolute until the
last visitor had come and gone. She
was careful to see that he confined his
speech to religion and uncompromis
ing subjects with every interviewer.
FINAL ARRANGEMENTS.
What Will Be Done in the Death
Chamber This Morning.
SAN QUKNTIN PRISON. Jan. 6.â lf
the arrangements are carried out to
the letter to-morrow morning Theodore
Durrant will expiate the Emmanuel
Church crimes.
If the fears and prediction of his
guards are fulfilled the execution will
not be wanting in extra m DsaUonal
features, for they foretell his abject
collapse when he faces the hangman.
If Durrant carries out his announced
intention he will deliver a prayer and
protest his innocence, while the execu
tioner poibt-s the black cap for his head.
If he d"i s neither, if he mounts the
trap with his old-time nerve and ac
cepts his fate in silence perhaps not
more than a minute will be consumed
between his departure from the death
chamber and his death fall. No one
seems to anticipate a confession. It
is expected of him that he will die with
sealed lips so far as his crimes are con
cerned. He will enact his religious
farce to the end, unless the universal
opinion here errs.
It is the present intention of the
Warden to enter the death-chamber
about 9 o'clock and read the death war
rant.
Before Durrant is led to the gallows
by his guards his mother will be al
lowed a last interview. Every precau
tion will be taken to prevent the carry
ing out of any plan of suicide that may
be contemplated, and the parting scene
will be kept within reasonable bounds
as to time.
A few moments before the condemn
ed man is taken to the scaffold those
who received permission to witness the
closing tragedy of Durranfs career will
be admitted to the execution chamber.
Three men will have preceded them
by another and private entrance and
taken their positions in a booth erected
for them on the scaffold. They will be
so placed that they can see the hang
man, while the spectators cannot see
them.
Durrant will mount the scaffold at
tended by his guards and spiritual ad
visers. When the black cap and rope
have been adjusted the executioner
will point his right hand to heaven.
This will be the signal for the three
men each to sever the strand of rope
over which each stands with a keen
edged knife resting against it.
One of these three strands, which
are so cunningly intertwined as to
conceal from every living conscious
ness the one which communicates with
the trap trigger, will drop Durrant to
death. The thud of the strained rope
will be lost in the awful crash of the
trap as it swings from under the feet
of the criminal and is caught by its
fasteners.
Thus will Theodore Durrant die.
The ermVen attitude of the murderer,
which la now revealed in the hour of
his despemtion and hopelessness, is
in striking contrast with the bravado
which sustained him so long and
which puzzled the analyst. He is no
longer the innocent stoic, the fearless
religionist. The nature of his kind
comes to the surface at last, as the
grim hand of avenging death reaches
out to clutch him.
BOARDMAN BEFORE COURT
H!3 Application for Writs and
Orders All Denied.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. Â«.â
Louis P. Boardman arrived here early
this morning from San Francisco to
make a last desperate effort to sava
Durrant's life. He endeavored to con
etal his presence in Washington and
registered as a commercial traveler at
the Hotel Raleigh under the assumed
name of "Charles A. Ceare, Chicago."
But The Call correspondents had re
ceived information that he would be
r-tre to-day and It was not long until
they discovered that Ceare of Chicago
was the man they wanted.
Mr. Boardman's talk of an hour with
Justice Brewer was fruitless. The
Justice declined to interfere with the
execution. Mr. Boardman appeared
to be very much down-cast when the
two emerged from the Supreme Court
chambers.
"Well, I guess it's all up with Dur
rant, boys," said he as he related the
story of his interview with Justice
Brewer,
Mr. Boardman then said he would,
bowcvar, make one last effort to save
Durrant before the full bench to
morrow. The court does not meet un
til 12 o'clock, and therefore whatever
he does must be done quickly, for
Durrant's execution 1b set for 10:30
o'clock.
Mr. Boardman has never been ad
mitted to practice before the Supreme
Court, and he will not attempt to be,
for thlÃ would consume a good deal of
time, and It will be precious to-mor
row morning.
'â¢There 1b one motion that I can
make, however, without being admit
ted to the bar, nnd that is a motion
for a writ of habeas corpus," said he
to-night.
"What will he your method of gain
ing recognition?" was asked.
"Why, when the court meets at 12
I will simply rise in my place and make
the motion," paid he.
It Is very evident, however, that Mr.
Boardman has abandoned all hope, and
realizes that Durrant will hang to
morrow morning.
"But," says he, "If by the merest pos
sibility my motion should be granted,
the telegram announcing a stay of ex
ecution could be rushed to San Quentin
In time to save him, provided the wires
are working all right, for when It is
1 o'clock here (an hour after the court
meets) it is only 10 o'clock at San
Quentin.
"Are the Justices aware that you will
make the motion for a writ of habeas
corpus?" was asked.
"They are not," said he. "for I did
not fully make up my mind to do it un
til after my conversation with Jus
tices Brewer and Harlan."
Justice Brewer refused both of At
torney Boardman's applications for in
terference in the case.
Immediately after the adjournment
of the Supreme Court at 4 o'clock Jus
tice Brewer repaired to the Attorney
General's room, where he received Mr. \
Boardman and went over the case in
detail with him. He first considered
the application to sign a citation upon
the appeal which was sought to be ta- j
ken from the judgment of the Federal â 
Circuit Court of Ca'.iforniadenying the j
issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, the j
object being to perfect the appeal.
The application Â« as refused, and
then Mr. Boardman presented an ap- j
plication for a writ of error from the
judgment of the Supreme Court of Cal
ifornia upon the appeal from the last
order of Judge Bahrs fixing the date I
for Durrant's execution, the object be
ing to secure a writ of supersedeas,
which would act as a stay of proceed
ings.
In this matter Mr. Boardman sought
tv h-'.ve the order denying this appeal
considered as the final judgment of the
Supreme Court in the case.
In denying the application upon the
habeas corpus proceedings. Justice
Brewer said that under the construc
tion by the court of the constitution,
the Federal courts had no power of
limitation upon the right of appeal in
habeas corpus proceedings, the oulnion
being that such appeals should not be
allowed where the appeal operates to
suspend the power of the State author
i ities, and especially where the case has
already been heard upon one appeal in
a habeas corpus proceeding.
: With reference to the Avrit of error
he considered especially the represen
tation of Mr. Boardman upon the claim
that as the constitution of California
grants an appeal such an appeal be
comes a vested right. The Justice con
sidered this point carefully, but said
that as he could not accept the court's
judgment on this point as its final ac
tion, he could not. therefore, see his
way clear to Interfere on this account.
Mr. Boardman pointed out that the
probable execution of murrant to-mor
row would have the practical effect of
making the Judgment final so far as it
should bear upon his fortunes, but the
Justice held to his original determina
tion in the matter.
The interview lasted forty minutes.
As to the legality of a telegraphic
] stay of execution, one of the justices of
the Supreme Court said to-night:
"It is a matter that, so far as I know,
has never been legally tested, but in
I case of a telegraphic stay being sent,
; properly attested by the clerk of the
court. I should think it would be most
unlikely that the warden In charge of
the execution would disregard it. In
| case of such disregard the <<.urt might
I very properly take cognizance of the
j matter afterward, bul in this case it
: would be too late to benefit the pris
! oner. Owing to the peculiar urgency
of the case. I should say that every
i facility will be given the attorney for
! the condemned for a speedy hearing.
whatever the action of the court may
be."

If it's up it's not down and if It's
down It's not up, according to the
Weather P.ureau's forecast official, W.

of his trustworthy barometer. He is
of the opinion that if the mercury
drops, more rain, which was so badly
wanted, will fall, and vice versa. For
two days rain had been predicted and
no rain was in evidence, but the third
fair weather was looked for and rain
came in plenty. Now the flat map is
supposed to be no account.
In northern California there will
probably be fresh winds and rain to
day, and it is predicted that the storm
is traveling toward the southern j>.>r

Francisco up to the present time has
been light, but throughout the country
surrounding Santa Rosa and Glen El

Utah, southern Idaho, New Mexico

ANGERED BY
FAIR PLAY OF

Los Angeles Papers
in Spasms Over
Webb.
They Have Evidently
United in Selecting Him
for a Victim.
However, the Violations of
the Law by Braly Are
Overlooked.
| PECULIAR PROSECUTIONS.
Men Most Active in the Los Angeles
School Scandal Connected With
Corporations.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 6.â Two of the
local papers are in spasms of blind
anger over what they assume to term
The Call's defense of Walter L. Webb,
the accused member of the Board of
Education. No attempt is made to deny
or refute the facts and circumstances
comprised In the signed statement of
the accused man, nor of the offenses
placed at the door of School Director
and Banker Braly and others, who are
positively known to be guilty of crimi
nal acts.
It is a notorious fact that three of the
local papers, the Times, Herald and
Express, have condemned Webb and
have assumed him to be guilty in the
face of the admitted fact that no legal
evidence has been adduced to connect
Webb with the bribery that has been
predicted. They have published gar
bled reports, distorted out of all sem
blance to the testimony and develop
ments, and have apparently combined
to punish Webb, whether he be guilty
or innocent.
Not only have they done this, but
they have willfully ignored facts which
nhowed the guilt of a leader in the
present movement for municipal re
form. Two of these papers, the Times
and Express, to-day actually took up
the defense of a man who they must
know is guilty of a more heinous
crime, according to the law, than that
charged against Webb. Reference is
made to the <ase of J. A. Braly, the
School Director and banker, who en
gaged in the shaving of teachers' war
rants in clear violation of the laws of
the State.
Every fair-minded and impartial
citizen of this city admits that Webb
h.is not been given fair treatment by
the local prtss, and it was simply in
deference to this sentiment, which is
rapidly growing, that The Call under
took to give the facts inthis unfortu
nate affair as they actually existed.
It is not the question of Webb's
guilt or innocence that is Just now
engrossing attention, but the subject
of fair and just treatment to all con
cerned. All that The Call has under
taken to do in this matter is to give
the news â not to distort or pervert any
fact or circumstance â but to simply
give the facts as they develop and
leave the public to form its own Judg
ment.
How thoroughly and unfairly the
Times Is prejudiced is shown by the
following paragraph in its half col
umn editorial attack on The Call:
"Another member of the School
Board, against whom no charges have
been found, is stigmatized in a most
uncomplimentary manner and his bus
iness is referred to aftor a fashion that
may be libelous." The "other mem
ber" here referred to by the Times is
J. H. Braly. It is true that "no
charges have been found" against
him, and therein is where justice and
the League for Better City Govern
ment and the Times, the Herald and
the Express have failed.
In the case of Mr. Braly, who is a
member of the League, by the way, the
evidence is incontrovertible, it is doc
umentary and the facts constituting
th>- violations of the law by him are
admitted by that gentleman.
In the case of Webb, the evidence is
acknowledged, even by his enemies, to
be of a very precarious character. Not
a few people are now asking "Why does
not thÂ» League for Better City Gov
ernment, if it is sincere In its work of
cleaning out the rascals, take action
against Braly. Cooper, Rhode, Morris
and Clara Sehroeter. at least to the ex
tent of having them removed from
their positions by the Board of Edu
cation?"
As part of its editorial attack, the
Express has this to say of the Call:
"It sets forth the conspiracy story,
which he that hath ears long enough
may believe, and follows this up with
a brutal and utterly unwarranted at
tack on another member of the board
and a deliberate effort to injure his
business interests."
This much the Express states and no
more. Where the brutality figures In
disclosing the guilt of J. H. Braly. a
public official, it fails to say. Nor does
it show in what respect this Is an "ut
terly unwarranted attack." Not a sin
pie fact printed by The Call in rela
tion to Mr. Braly is denied by either
the Express or the Times. The records
are in the office of the City Auditor, and
whoever has any curiosity in the mat
ter has the right to Inspect them.
Another question asked by the people
here and one which every fair minded
American citizen would like to see an
pwered by the local papers is why have
these papers apparently determined to
convict Webb and to acquit Braly.
It may be stated at this point* that
The Call stands ready at this md all
times to aid in the eradication of cor
ruption, in the punishment of corrup
tioniats an<t In the establishment of
good government. Webb may be Err.il
ty, and many people believe he is, but
no one has been found by The Call cor
respondent who does not admit that
there has been no legal testimony
brought out against him.
A prominent attorney and a gentle
man who believes that Webb may be
guilty of the charges preferred against
him thus expresses what is the senti
ment of the better and conservative
people:
"There is no question that the local
papers, with the exception of the Rec
ord, have been hounding Webb. They
have pronounced him guilty despite
the absence of testimony to prove him
so. He may be guilty, but if the news
papers are to be permitted to single
out a man and thus wantonly con
demn him in the eyes of the public no
man, no matter how high his standing
in the community, is safe from such
attacks. It is unjust; it is unfair; it is
un-American, and outrages th<Â» best
feelings of decent people. The Call, In
my opinion, has simply taken up this
matter, and rightly, on the broad and
liberal ground of malice toward none
and Justice for all, and deserves the
gratitude and support of every right
thinking individual."
Webb in his signed statement
charged that he was being made the
victim of a conspiracy in which the
League for Better City Government
for political reasons, and the friends
of Miss Mac Owen, the deposed school
teacher, for the purposes of revenge,
were taking part. In this connection
some significant relationships are be
ing cited among the individuals prom
inent in the Webb prosecution. W. B.
Cline, T. E. Gibbon and W. A. Cheney
are the three gentlemen who were most
solicitous and active in behalf of Miss
Owen. Cline is president of both the
Los Angeles Lighting Company and
the Los Angeles Electric Company.
T. E. Gibbon, who is director of the
League for Better City Government, is
the attorney for the Los Angeles Elec
tric Company, and was, before he went
East on other business, the attorney in
charge of the prosecution against
Webb. He is also vice-president of the
Los Angeles Terminal Hallway Com
pany.
Cheney, the leading counsel now in
the prosecution of Webb, is the attor
ney for the Los Angeles Lighting Com
pany, but a recent acquaintance of
Miss Mac Owen, and declines to state
whether or not he is the personal at
torney of Cllne^
F. K. Rule, the president of the
League for Better City Government, is
auditor, secretary and treasurer of the
Los Angeles Terminal Railway Com
pany, of which Gibbon is vice-presi
dent.

BERLIN, Jan. 6.â The German press
is indulging in a tone of extravagant
self-satisfaction over the success of
German diplomacy in China. The fact
that Emperor William could personally
confer the order of the Red Eagle on
Baron yon Buelow, the German For
eign Minister, for his share in the af
fair, indicates that the Emperor is de
lighted with the outcome of his policy.
The newspapers, with the exception
of the Vossische Zeitung, are full of
sneering remarks at England's expense.
The Vossische Zeitung, however, points
out that there is plenty of room for
everybody, and even suggests that the
time has arrived for a "better under
standing between England and Ger
many."
The rather apologetic tone of the
North German Gazette in its semi
official article yesterday seems to bear
reflection of the feeling in some quar
ters that the acquisition of a coaling
station is hardly the realization of the
great colonial enterprise which the
blaze of Prince Henry's departure fore
shadowed, and the suggestion of the
possibility that Kiaochau might prove
unsuitable leads many to ask whether
Germany, after all, has taken a leap
in the dark.
It is now discovered that if Germany
moves north she is bound to clash with
Russian interests; if further south,
then with English interests. Already
it is proposed to establish a branch of
the German-Asiatic Bank at Kiaochau
and postal regulations will be issued.
The Government is ordering the prepa
ration of maps and charts of the dis
trict and proposes to begin the explor
ation of the coal beds of Shantung
peninsula immediately.
Various rumors are current as to the
I conferences of the powers to settle the '.
Chinese question, but none can be re- :
t lied upon. Herr Richter, in the Freis- i
I sinige, thinks an unnecessary noise has
been raised for what he calls an ome
lette, and he says he cannot perceive
any commercial advantage in the ac- ;
quisition of Kiaochau.
The North German Gazette, in a
semi-official article, says:
"The development of affairs In East j
Asia is becoming more tranquil. The |
trouble was caused by the political an- j
tagonism of Great Britain and Rus
sia, but behind the political antagon
ism now appears an economic one,
which, however, should be arranged
with little difficulty. There is no rea
â on why one state should exclusively
undertake the Chinese loan. The in- j
dications are in favor of dividing the i
loan."
In another article the North German
Gazette says: "The main purport of
the Chinese agreement shows in full
light the German objects in Eastern
Asia, which are free from all violence.
Germany does not seek to force her
way into Chinese territory as a con
queror, but she will peacefully develop
that conceded to her. As in all Ger
many's transmarine enterprises, fur
ther action is subordinate to modera
tion. The arrangement has strength
ened rather than prejudiced the China-
Germany relationship. Moreover, we
have, from an economic and commer
cial point of view, secured an advan
tage which we could not renounce
without self-depreciation."
VIENNA, Jan. 6.â The Deutsche Zei
tung. echoing German feeling, says:
"England has suffered a crushing de
feat, but there is no fear of war. The
British lion roars, but he does not bite.
All civilized nations ought to be grate
ful to Emperor William for having de
stroyed the myth of Great Britain's
universal domination."
A FOLK-SONG RECITAL.
A Distinguished Er)tertainri)ent
Given by Miss Villa Whit
ney White.
Miss Villa Whitney White pave the
first of a series of three lecture reci
tals of German folk-song at the Cali
fornia Theater last night, before an
audience which, in point of size, was
ridiculously inadequate to the value of
the entertainment. To the very few
lovers of music who attended the
evening was one of refined and unique
charm. Miss White is a young woman
of delightful personality, good educa
tion and good sense; her voice is full
and sympathetic, both in speech and
song; and she sings with appreciation.
There is something almost repressed in
her way of giving the songs â and this
seems to intensify and make more
delicately evident her understanding
of the folk-song, of which music alone
can never be more than half. And in
this she is splendidly aided by Miss
Mary B. DiUingham. who accompa
nies on the piano with rare insight and
plasticity. Miss White gives to the text
its full value; first telling the story in
The Perfume of Violets I
The purity of the lily, the glÂ° w of the rose, l
and the flush of Hebe combine In Pozzoiu'sl
wondrous Powder. |
English, then singing it in the original
tongue. She weds the words and the
melody so beautifully that you have at
once the picture, perfume and spirit â
the song itself. In these days of ram
pant virtuosity and sensationalism it
is a lovely thing to now and then get
back to the modesty of music.
Lecture sounds so formidable a
word I dislike associating it with Miss
White's little discourses on the devel
opment and significance of folk-song.
Say that she talked, not too formally
and yet with pretty precision and au
thority, of the vital part the folk-song
has played in the music of Western
Europe of its almost extermination
at the hands of the contrafuntalistsâ
of its renascent popularity, due to the
Florentine melodists; of how it crys
tallized song-verse; of its early har
monic structure; of the evolution of
its accompaniment, from Hans Leo
Hasler Schubert, to Schumann, to
Brahms.
In all Miss White sang nineteen
numbers, covering in a more or less
degree and chronological order the en
tire history of folk-song. The remain
ing recitals will be of a more special
ized nature, to-morrow night's being
devoted exclusively to the Schubert
cyclus and the Saturday matinee to
the cyclus of ten by Alexander yon
Felitz and groups of Welsh, Irish,
English and Scotch. "â¢
Clever Thieves Caught.
Lou Keller and George Abrams were
arrested by Captain Callundan and Offi
o.rs Daws and Allen of the Morse De
tective Agency last evening and booked
at the California Station for petit lar
ceny. The prisoners have been suspected
of thieving for some time, and the offi
cers have been on the watch for them.
Abrams works at a hardware store at
113 Batten,- street, and last evening was
seen to hand Keller a package which he
brought from the store. This was found
to contain three dozen Yale locks. There
is supposed to be a confederate of the
men working at Langley & Michael s
drug store. Keller has been selling drugs
and hardware from time to time at dif
ferent stores, and it was through this
that the detectives learned of the rob
beries.
Found Dead by Her Children.
Mrs. Ann Cooper was found dead by
her children at her home, 2315 Mason
street, yesterday afternoon. She was
sitting at a table, with her head resting
on her hands. The little ones thought
her asleep, but being unable to awake
her, sent word to the father, who works
In the Danforth warehouse, and he noti
fied Policeman Olsen. The officer
thought the case a suspicious one, and
told the Deputy Coroner not to touch
the body until the detectives came. An
investigation proved that the woman had
died from natural causes.
The Presiding Judge.
The Police Judges, with the exception
of Judge Conlan. met at noon Wednes
day and elected Judge Campbell the pre
siding Judge for the next six months.
Judge Conlan was holding court at the
time and gave that as a reason for not
attending the meeting, but it was said
that there was a weightier reason, and
that he declined to hold himself responsi
ble for the action of the other Judges.
Stage Robbers Brought to the City.
James H. Davis and Edgar Ij. Davis,
the two brothers who were arrested for
holding up a stage in Mendocino County
seveiV.l months ago, were brought to the
city by Kx-Sheriff Stanley last evening
and lodged in the County Jail. The men
are to appear before the T'nited States
Grand Jury next week on the charge of
attempt to rob the mails.

First Ballot.

DEMOCRATS URGED ON.
Republicans CÂ«lle<3 to a Convention to
Protest Against the Attempt to
Defeat Hanna.
Special Dispatch to The CÂ«.IL
COLUMBUS, Ohio, Jan. 6. â Conserva
tive estimates to-night place the legis
lative vote at 73 to 7t> against Hanna.
The workers of the Senator claim 71
votes and assurances of the necessary
two additional votes and possibly four.
The opposition Insists that Hanna
will never have 70 votes on Joint ballot
and that they have gained two votes
since the Legislature adjourned over
till Monday. Before the chairmanships
and preferred places and other patron
age are disposed of the opposition pay
that Hanna's vote will be reduced con
siderably below 70, which Is now at
least three short of enough to elect.
The opposition to Hanna consists of
the 65 Democratic members and 10 Re
publican members.
Included In the list of those support
ing Hanna are Representatives Droste
and Lane, silver Republican fusionists
from Cincinnati, who are counted on
for Jeptha Gerrard. The developments
to-day Indicated that Gerrard would
not only -be voted for on the ballots for
Senator, but that he might lead on the
first ballot if the present efforts are
successful to make him the free silver
Republican candidate. Gerrard is one
of the most wealthy men in Cincinnati
end he has always been a radical free
silver man.
Representative James Joyce of
Guernsey, who is included in the sev
enty votes claimed for Hanna, is con
sidered as doubtful. The Hanna men
claim that Jones of Stark, Redky of
Highland. Rutan of Carroll and Har
rison and Manuel of Montgomery, who
are on the list of the opposition, are
doubtful. The "combine" workers
were aggressive until the past day or
. when they not only had enough
vnipfi to defeat Hanna, but had also
:ied all the doubtful members.
The opposition is now on the defensive
. in keeping its majority in line. The
y-- contest has settled down to a siege, in
which the opposition holds the fort
i and the Hanna men are charging on
the breastworks. With the organiza
tion of the Legislature, the adminis
tration and other uncovered ramparts
the opposition feels well fortified. It
is conceded that the opposition is well
organized and drilled and also desper
ate in this fight. Kver since Kurtz
was retired as State chairman by
Hanna at the State convention in
Toledo last June efforts have been
made to retire Hanna, and there will
. be a fight to a finish on that issue.
The talk about Senator Burke being
In the doubtful list has about sub-
Hi-dcd. He was slated for President
;.pro tern, of the Senate by the opposi
tion, but as he "was not present on
:,...; Monday to qualify Senator Thaddeus
E. Crumley, a Democrat, was elected
â â¢; '. "President pro tern. It transpires that
Senator Crumley wrote out his resig
..... ration before his election, and it is in
the- hands of Senator Fink, the leader
.of the Democratic side. Whenever Sen
â¢. ator Burke is ready Senator Fink will
present the resignation of Crumley as
President pro tern, and Burke will get
. ; . the place.
So far the opposition to Hanna is not
:. -only holding its men well in line, but
â¢It has executed all the plans provided
for previous to th<- caucuses of last
â Ââ¢:.S aturday night. The opposition man
: pagers say they are having no trouble
â to hold their men out against Hanna,
. '. but admit their trouble in finding any
â ' candidate for whom all the "bolting"
Republicans and Democrats will vote.
The "bolting" Republicans are unani
. rnous in declaring they cannot vote for
â¢ ' any Democrat under the clrr-um
etances for Senator. Enough Demo
. cratic members to give the managers
f trouble and anxiety say that they do
not want to vote for a Republican for
Senator.
The solicitude of the "combine" on
this issue is shown in an editorial
leader in this . evening's issue of thÂ»
Democratic Press, the organ of the
combined opposition to Senator
Hanna, which says: "The Democratic
members of the Legislature now have
it in their power to defeat If. A.
Hanna for the Senate, and the blame
for a failure to do it will rest with
them. They can make no satisfactory
explanation if they fail. Stupidity in
Buch an emergency as the present is
as Intolerable as guilt. Every Repub
lican vote against Boxwell for Speaker
was cast to show unfaltering opposi
tion tn Hanna and has no other mean
in? whatever. If so, the overthrow of
Hanna can be accomplished by the
Fame union of Bryan Democrats and
For.aker Republicans that defeated
Boxwell and elector] MasOÃ Speaker.
How can this be brought about? Of
course Hanna cannot be elected so
long as every Democrat and Foraker
Republican is in his Sf-;it and refuses
t<> vote for him. But if any of them
remain away when the. vote is being
taken he may be elected (or so de
clared) by less than a majority of all
tho members elected to the Assembly.
To puard against this chance let every
J"mocratic member be present when
the ballots for Senator are taken."
A call was issued to-night by the
republican State executive committee
for a mass convention of Republicans
to be held in this city next Monday to
protest against the attempt to defeat
Senator Hanna.
A report was current to-night that
_.. a telegram had been received by the
v Democratic leaders from John R. Mc
4 Lean requesting that his name be kept
tmt of the Senatorial matter and urg
ing the Democrats to agree upon a
candjdate for Senator to defeat Mr
Hanna.

to Settle Debts.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
"Washington, Jan. 6.
The House Committee on Pacific
Railroads held its first regular meet
ing this morning. All bills before the
committee were called up in order for
their consideration. Maguire's bill giv
\ Ing the Supreme Court of the District
of Columbia exclusive jurisdiction of
the foreclosure proceedings was passed
for a week, Hepburn's bill for the set
tlement of the Sioux City and Pacific
railroad debt was referred to a sub
committee, consisting of Hepburn,
Shattuc and Maguire. Hepburn sug
gested that in former hearings the
present value of this debt was esti
mated at about 51,500.000.
Maguire said in view of serious error
in the estimates concerning the value
of the Union Pacific main line at the
former hearings it would be well to re
investigate and revise the estimates on
the Sioux City road. This was agreed
to.
Powers said he thought this course
proper, because the new members of
the committee had not had the advan
tage of being present at former hear
ings.
The Fleming bill, authorizing the
President to bid at his discretion on
the Kansas Pacific and other Pacific
railroads, was next taken up. Maguire
objected to the provision giving dis
cretion to the President as to the
amoupnt to be bid on behalf of the
Government, and insisted that the
President be required by the act to bid
an amount sufficient to pay the entire
amount to be bid on behalf of the
above the first mortgage.
Shattuc said that the road was not
worth more than $13,000,000 and that
the Government ought not under any
circumstances to pay more than that
for the road. He was utterly opposed
to Maguire's plan, because a provision
requiring the Government to bear the
whole amount, which would be about
J19.000.000, would probably cause the
road to fall into the hands of the Gov
ernment and establish a pernicious ex
periment in government ownership, to
which he is opposed.
Maguire said he did not view the
possibility of government ownership
with any alarm and that as the gov
ernment, in the case of the Kansas
Pacific, was bound to lose all of its
claim except the portion paid out of
the proceeds of the foreclosure sale it
would not cost the government a cent
more to buy the road at $19,000,000 than
it -ttould at $13,000,000. So the Presi
dent might as well be required to bid
the whole amount, and in the absence
of a higher bid to reduce the road to
government ownership and possession.
The road could then, under appropri
ate legislation (if thought advisable by
Congress), be offered for sale free from
the junior ineumbrances and other
complications now effecting it.
Fleming said he considered Maguire's
objection well taken and would vote
for his amendment to the bill, and that
he had introduced the bill as an urgent
measure desired and, in fact, prepared
by the Attorney-General, to put the
government in a position to bid at the
approaching Kansas Pacific sale, but
that he was satisfied the bill should
be amended in the manner proposed by
Maguire.
The bill was then referee*?, to a sub
committee of three to report at next
meeting. Other bills of minor import
ance were passed until next week, and
the Hepburn bill, providing for a com
mission of Cabinet officers to adjust
and settle the Pacific railroad debts,
was taken up.
Maguire inquired if it was the pur
pose of Hepburn to press its considera
tion. He stated that such was his pur
pose and that as the bill involved a
consideration of the whole Pacific rail
road problem, it might as well be con
sidered by the entire committee in the
first instance, instead of being referred
to a sub-committee. After some dis
cussion this was agreed to, but no time
was fixed for the consideration of the
bill.
The statement of Hepburn that he
intends to press the consideration of
this bill is generally accepted as indi
cating the form that the Pacific rail
road fight will take in the present Con
gress.

THE SA^ FRAXCTSCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 7, 1898.
HUMAN BEINGS
SOLD AT AUCTION
Florida Convicts Are Put on
the Block and Knocked Down
to the Highest Bidder as
in Slavery Days.
NEW YORK, Jan. 6.â A special to the Herald from West Palm
Beach, Florida, says: The State of Florida to-day auctioned oft 410
human beings, bringing to mind old slavery times, the only difference
being, perhaps, that in the olden days black chattels were worth
money. In this case the persons sold were only temporary slaves â
convicts. They had been brought here from the western part of the
State to be sold to the growers of tropical fruits.
Auctioneer "Jack" Gundy called bidders to the front at 10 o'clock
and began the sale. The bidders had inspected the convicts as if they
were cattle. The bidding was different from that at auctions gener
ally. One man would bid for ten men, and if no one else bid higher
he had the choice. William Stover of Fort Pierce bid in the first ten
men. To the negroes the sale seemed a sort of picnic, but the whites
shuffled forward most of them with downcast faces and limping gait.
Others boldly faced the crowd, and seemed totally indifferent to the
scene. Those having a record for even tempers were first chosen, while
the unruly ones were the last to go. After the able-bodied men had
been disposed of the boys were chosen, the women and girls going last.
There were only ten white women in the crowd, and they were the
most miserable creatures, hollow-eyed, wan and sallow. They were In
for two years, most of them, and they secured fairly good masters,
according to the way things were.
For half a day this scene continued, and then the auctioneer and
bidders adjourned for dinner. After dinner, the crowd came back and
the auction was finished in an hour. Then the men were told off In
gangs, the chains adjusted and the new masters took charge of their
laborers and set off for home. The convicts will probably have an
easier time than heretofore, as the men on the east coast will take
better care of them. The turpentine camps in the western part of
Florida, where the convicts had been, were miserable, and from the
stories told by some of the men, death was a welcome release. They
were kept at work from daylight until dark In chains, and were fed
only twice daily, and then upon the cheapest and poorest food. They
will now be employed on big pineapple plantations, in orange groves
and gardens and on railroad work and canal cutting near Lake Worth.
ROBBED BY A
NIGHT CLERK
Cash and Bonds Stolen
From an Express
Office.
Valuables Intended for Trans
mission by Train Taken by
an Employe.
Among the Thinga Carried Off by the
Absconder Are Five Chicago
Gas Bonds.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Jan. 6.â The American
Express Company was robbed to-day
of $10,502, and Clark Braden Jr., a ;
trusted employe, is missing. Central
officers and private detectives are
hunting for him.
Three days ago the night manager in
charge of the office at Forty-seventh
street and Madison avenue was taken
ill, and Braden. a clerk of the company
for more than ten years, was temporar
ily substituted. This office the com
pany uses as a clearing-house for all
its matter sent or received from the
Grand Central station. Among â¢ the
parcels to be sent out on the 6:30 train
on the Hudson River road this morning
were several containing cash to the
amount of $5582. and one containing
five $1000 Chicago gas bonds. It was
Braden's place to take, these packages
to the train, return to the office and re
main on duty until 7 o'clock.
When the day employes arrived
Braden was not in the office. The safe
was locked. There were no receipts for
valuable packages by the morning
train, although the books showed that
several such parcels had been received
at the office.
At first the absence of Braden and
the receipts were set down to careless
ness. But a few minutes later the
leather bags which had contained the
packages were found under some other
freight. They had been cut open and
the money and bonds taken.
That the robbery was hastily carried
out is shown by the fact that $25,000,
mostly in cash, was left in the safe and
that the bonds were taken.
Notices were sent to every bank and
financial institution in the country
warning them against purchasing the
stolen gas bonds.
CHICAGO, Jan. 6.â The Chicago po
lice were requested this evening by the
Pinkerton Detective Agency to appre
hend Clark Braden Jr., the absconding
night clerk of the American Express
Company in the New York office. In
stead of a $1,000,000 robbery, as ru
mnred at first, the loss suffered by the
express company through the clerk's
dlsappearnace, the Plnkertons allege.
$30,000. According to the statement
made by the detective agency of the
amount taken by Braden $25,000 was in
currency, including five $100 and five
$1000 gold bonds of the Consumers'
Gas Company of Chicago.

WOMAN'S AWFUL
DEATH BY FIRE
Burned to a Crisp During
Her Husband's Ab

The Roasted Remains Nearly
Devoured by Wildcats
and Coyotes.
Terrible Home-Comlng of a Colusa
Man Who Had BÂ«en Search
ing for Work.
Bpecla! DUratch to The Call.
GRASS VALLEY, Jan. 6.âParticu
lars of a most horrifying casualty were
brought to town to-night by Coroner
Hocking. A woman burned to death,
her ch.ild frightfully burned about the
face and from which injuries it will
die, and husband and father frantic
with grief, briefly tells the story. On
Tuesday last Paul Vetch, who with his
family resided in a small dwelling six
teen miles south of here on the Colfax
road, came to Grass Valley in an en
deavor to secure employment in one
of the mines. Being unsuccessful,
with his brother he started for home
on Wednesday afternoon, reaching
there after dark. He expected to see a
light in the house, but thÂ»re was nono
to greet him. The husband entered the
rear door and called to his wife, but
there wai no response. Thinking she
had perhaps retired Vetch told his
brother to strike a match while he
went to the front room, but his wife
was not there. Again he called her by
name, and no answer coining he was
horrified with fear.
Running out to the back door once
again his calls met with no reply, and
then he commenced a search. After
going about fifty feet Vetch stumbled
upon his wife's Inanimate body. The
sight that met his eyes wasÂ«too awful
to describe. Every stitch of clothing
had been burned from the woman's
body, only her shoes remaining. The
lower portion of the woman's, body
had been burned to a crisp, h-r legs be
ing twisted Into peculiar shapes by
the heat. The face and head were not
badly burned, but they might as w.ll
have been, for they but furnished fond
for ravenous coyotes and oats. The
head was torn and presented a terrible
sight.
Search was next made for Vetch's
four-month-old child, which was
found in Its cradle almost naked with
Its head badly burned and chilled
through from exposure, as the woman
in rushing out of the building had
left the doors wide open. Kind
neighbors were summoned and re
vived the child, but it is doubtful if it
will live.
It is believed the woman was starting
a fire in the fireplace and in doing so
her dress caught fire, enveloping her
In flames, and that in her frantic ef
forts she probably threw a piece of the
burning dress on her baby's head. The
woman undoubtedly tried to got out
of the house by the front door, but it
being locked she escaped through the
rear door. Appearances Indicate that
she had rolled on tho ground several
times, hoping to smother the flames,
when she finally lost strength and con
sciousness and was burned to a crisp.
The Coroner's Inquest brought in a
verdict In accordance with the above
facts. Mrs. Vetch was 23 years of age
and a native of California. Her maiden
name was Annie Cook, ami shf had
been married to her husband about fif
teen months.

Cause Before the Superior
Court.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA ROSA, Jan. B.â Late this
afternoon Michael McDonough, aged
70 years, walked Into the County
Clerk's office here and told Mr. Ful
ton that he wanted a license to wed
Mrs. Susie Baker, aged 63, who Is a
well-known resident of Healdsburg.
Although Mr. McDonough is quite an
old man, he looked as if he meant bus
iness, so the County Clerk began mak
ing out the document without further
ado. That official asked McDonough a
few questions as he proceeded with
the work, however, one being whether
he or Mrs. Baker had been divorced
within the past year.
Upon finding that Mrs. Baker had
been granted her freedom from her
former spouse only a few months ago,
the Clerk refused to proceed further
with his partially completed task, on
the grounds that a recent law forbids
the marriage of persons divorced with
in a year.
McDonough stormed, but the Clerk
was obdurate, whereupon the old gen
tleman left the Courthouse with blood
in his eye. About an hour later, and
Just as Judge Dougherty of the Su
perior Court was preparing to ad
journ, Mrs. Baker, accompanied by her
counsel. R. W. Miller, appeared before
the court and demanded and secured
an alternate writ of mandate direct
ing County Clerk Fulton to appear be
fore the court to-morrow morning and
show cause why he should not be com
pelled to issue the license without fur
ther loss of time.
Mrs. Baker says that as McDon
ough tried and failed to secure permis
sion for them to wed, she thought she
would Just take a hand herself.
The outcome of the case is awaited
with interest here, where the parties
are well known. McDonough Is a resi
dent of Geyserville and one of his sons
is proprietor of the Sotoyome House at
Heald.sburg. while another is a con
ductor on the Donahue Railroad.

EXCORIATES
CARL SCHURZ
Redhot Criticism of
a Civil Service
Reformer.
Declared a Political Leper
and a Traitor to All
Parties.
Assaults on the Present Law
Are Continued in the
House.
JOHNSON TO THE DEFENSE
ThÂ« Indian* Statesman Protests
Against the Policy of Pursuing
tha Spoils System.
BpÂ«cial Dlipatch to The Call.
, WASHINGTON. Jan. 6.â The friends
and enemies of the Civil Service law
exchanged broadsides in the House
to-day. The heaviest guns on each
Bide were brought into action. Grosve
nor of Ohio and Johnson of Indiana
each made exhaustive speeches and
kept their respective sides in a con
stant furor. The interest in the de
bate was much more lively than yes
terday. The crowded galleries, which
were plainly in sympathy with the op
position to the law, became so very
noisy in their demonstrations of ap
proval at one juncture that the Chair
was compelled to call them to order.
Johnson was warmly sustained by the
friends of the law on the floor, but he
got very little applause from the gal
leries. Lloyd of Missouri was the only
other speaker. He favored the repeal
of the law.
Grosvenor of Ohio took the floor with
an elaborate speech in opposition to
the law. Grosvenor disclaimed any
leadership of the anti-civil service re
form forces and any purpose to speak
for any officer of the Government, ex
ecutive, legislative or judicial.
"All efforts to entangle me in a col
lision with the President," said he,
"are as so much powder wasted. If I
believed that my relations to the Exec
utive would be changed or modified be
cause I differ from him in any repara
tive capacity, I would despise him as
he would despise me if I faltered in my
convictions."
Grosvenor said he had watched with
admiration the President's public ca
reer, and one of his most prominent
characteristics had always been that
he not only did not demand subserv
iency, but despised a man who sought
fuvors by sycopancy.
Grosvenor then proceeded to pay his
respects to the National Civil Service
Reform League and to Carl Schurz, its
president. - His excoriation of the lat
ter was the most scathing that has
been heard on the floor of the House in
months. He denounced unsparingly
those who sought to read out of the
Republican party those who believed in
the civil service law. He sketched the
political life of Mr. Schurz, which he
characterized as "the checkered,
spotted, leprous career of one who be
trayed every party and every duty to
which he was bound, and whose be
trayal should be his only stock in trade
In the arena of politics."
He traced Mr. Schurz' political his
tory, and defied any one to name a
point in the trail which was not tainted
â with political corruption. Yet, he said,
this was the man who, with other
"political demagogues" at Cincinnati,
under the name of the "National Civil
Service League," had denounced him
and those who thought with him on
this question. He read the resolutions
adopted at the Cincinnati meeting,
branding them as infamous beyond de
scription.
Grosvenors description of the habits
of the "cuckoo" teemed with wit and
kept the House In a roar. Grosvenor,
in replying to the charge made against
himself and his colleagues that they
â were betraying the Republican party,
adverted to what he called the list of
traitors among the high priests of civil
service reform, at the head of which
he placed George William Curtis, who
abandoned the Republican party fn
1884. He reviewed the platform declar
ations of the Republican party to show
that the present position occupied by
the majority of the House was not in
consistent with these declarations.
"For I give the members of the civil |
service committee notice," said he, j
"that we have a majority on this floor, i
and you cannot strangle a majority in
the American Congress." (Applause.) |
He argued that when the St. Louis
platform was adopted the extensions
contained in the Cleveland order of
May, 1S!)O, had not been understood. It
was not until November, Ifc96, that the j
enormous scope of that order covering 'â 
46.000 officials, was publicly declared.
The Republicans coming into power on
a platform adopted by these vast ex
tensions were not in honor bound to
agree to them and it was proper thf.t
the President rhnuld announce in his
message to Congress that there were
portions of these orders which never
ought to have been made.
Grosvenor discussed the practical ef
fect of the law and the examinations
of the committee, giving many tit tut- '
trations of applicants who, throi*?h j
years of service, had proved their abil
ity, but who failed to answer questions
asked.
One of Grosvenor's statements which
evoked an enthusiastic outburst from
the galleries was in the nature of a
warning that if members refused to
listen to the voice of the people in
hostility to this law they would not
be members of the Fifty-sixth House
of Representatives. He argued that
the people were overwhelmingly op
posed to the law and said that hun
dreds of thousands of Republicans felt
a secret sympathy with Mayor Van
Wyck of New York, who announced
that none but Democrats would be ap
pointed to office under the new city
government. Governor Black said a
few days ago, when "the late lament
ed" Republican government came into
power, there were 15,000 Tammany men
in office and when it expired there
were still 16,000 Tammany .men on the
pay roll. The Republicans. Grosvenor
said, had been justly punished for
keeping these enemies In their camps.
Grosvenor professed his adherence to
the people of the merit system and
theory of examinations for office with
in certain limitations.
"But," he exclaimed In conclusion,
addressing the defenders of the law,
"I want to serve notice on you that
unless yc-u join us in the correction
of the abuses and the reformation of
the law, we will join any portion
of the community â legislative, execu
tive or judicial â and destroy the law,
root and branch." (Uproarious ap
plause in the galleries.)
Johnson (R.) of Indiana, one of the
ardent defenders of the law, followed
Grosvpnor with an extended argument
in support of the merit system. He
took occasion to review the history of
the civil service, pointing out that pre
vious to the time of Jackson the spoils
system did not exist. Men were ap
pointed to ofHce for fitness, yet never
was party feeling stronger than then.
In England, where the merit system
prevailed, party spirit was most vip
orous. It was absurd, he contended,
to say that party spirit must be fed
upon the bribe of office. He repudiated
the statement? of the adversaries of
the law that Lincoln and Grant be
lieved in the spoils system.
In his review of the records of emi
nent men on this subject. Johnson be
came involved in a controversy with
his colleague. Landis (R.) of Indiana,
and during the cross-firing the galler
ies became so chstreperous In thoir ap
proval of the position of the latter that
the chair was obliged to suspend the
debate and admonish the spectators
that such demonstrations must cease.
In enumerating the evils of the spoils
system, Johnson said it made cowards
of legislators, stormed the White
House, Interfered with the depart
ments, stretched into the Capitol and
shaped legislation; it exaltod the of
fice broker and attacked, villified and
<'alumniat^<l the conscientious man.
Words, he declared, could not do jus
tice to the infamy of this prolific evil,
which had debauched the civil service.
It seemed incredible to him that men
could dare advocate a return of this
saturnalia. The talk of a civil pension,
he said, was a bugaboo designed to
frighten the defenders of the merit sys
tem. A proposition for a civil pension
could not command half a dozen votes
in either he-use or secure the executive
approval.
Speaking to the Republican side of
the House, he told his colleagues that
the merit system was a Republican
child. While George H. Pendleton was
its author in inception, it was a Re
publican measure. Every Republican
Senator and all except seven Republi
can members of the House voted for it.
It has been indorsed by State and na
tional conventions. Pities and States
were adopting it. The American peo
ple were behind it.
Johnson attributed the present "dis
cordant and disgraceful scene" now be
ing enacted in Ohio, with its "visions
of senatorships going glimmering." to
the scramble for spoils. State and na
tional, and said that the surest way to
put Bryan and his black banner in the
White House in 1900 would be for the
Republican party to be recreant to Its
trust and slap in the fare those who
believed in honestly conducted service.
Without desiring in any way to re
flect upon the present occupant of the
White House, Johnson said he was con
vinced that there could be no genuine
civil service reform until by constitu
tional amendment the President was
made Ineligible for re-election. As
long as he was eligible for re-election
he must necessarily be more or less
under the domination of machine poli
tics. After expressing his confidence
in President McKinley Johnson con
cluded with an eloquent appeal to him
to stand by the principle upon the per
petuity of which the permanence of our
institutions depended.
Johnson was given an enthusiastic
demonstration of approval when he
concluded.
Lloyd (D.) of Missouri followed in
opposition to the law, which, he ar
gued, was an attempt to establish an
; aristocratic Government by establish
ing an office holding class.
At 4:50 p. m. the House adjourned.
LANDS IN YOSEMITE PARK.
Bills Relating to the Acquirement by the
Government of Private Claims.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 6.âRepresenta
tive de Vries to-day Introduced bills
in the House affecting the question of
acquiring title by the Government to
private land claims within the boun
daries of the Yosemite National Park.
The first provides that upon the owner
granting this property to the Govern
ment the Secretary of the Interior shall
issue therefore "lieu scrip certificates "
which will entitle the holder to locate
a similar number of acres in any other
part of the unsettled public domain.
This is similar to the provision already
made in the case of forest reserves,
and was drawn by De Vrles (as were
other bills) after consultation with the
Commissioner of the General Land
Office.
The second bill provides that upon
the owner granting his property to the
Government he shall receive therefor
the moneys paid the general Govern
ment in acquiring title to the prop
erty, the taxes already paid and the
reasonable value of his improvements
The enforcement of these bills is to be
effected through rules and regulations
to be prescribed by the Interior De
partment. Their provisions are op
tional with the owner, but he must
avail himself of the provisions within
a given time.
BITTENGER BLACKBALLED

were cast against Mr. Bittenger.
Colonel Knapp of New York and W.

Special Dispatch to The CalL
Call Office. RiggÃ House,
Washington, Jan. 6.
While the Senate was in session two
hours to-day, practically no business
was transacted beyond the passage of
a few bills. Among the measures which
received favorable consideration were
the bills providing for a congress of
the representatives of the Indian tribes
of the United States, to be held at
Omaha during the progress of the In
ternational Exposition this year; bills
providing for the erection of public
buildings at Fergus Falls, Minn., and
Newport News, Va., and a measure to
protect the name and insignia of the
Red Cross Society.
Allen of Nebraska called up and the
Senate passed the bill providing for
the holding of a congress of the rep
resentatives of different Indian tribes
of the United States at Omaha in 1898,
and appropriating $45,000 therefor.
Some minor amendments to the bill
were adopted.
A bill appropriating $175,000 for a
public building at Fergus Falls, Minn.,
was passed.
The bill to protect the name and In
sipnia of the Red Cro9s was passed,
Mr. Gray of Delaware explaining that
Miss Clara Barton several years ago
asked that the insignia of the Red
Cross Society be protected from those
who would use it for commercial or
perhaps fraudulent purposes. Under
treaty entered into by a majority of
the civilized nations of the world, the
sign (â¢â¬ the Red Cross is known as an
insignia of hospital corps or charitable
organizations. Other nations had pro
tected the insignia of the society, and
the United States ought also to pro
tect it.
After some routine business, the Sen
ate, on motion of Mr. Gray, went into
executive session.
After a brief executive session, dur
ing which some consuls were confirm
ed, the Senate adjourned.
In the executive session Senator Pet
tigrew, chairman of tho committee on

SENT WOMEN AND

Preliminary Steps Taken by the Khalifa
Before Beginning Hostilities Against
the British.
LONDON, Jan. 7.â The Marseillos
correspondent of the Daily Telegraph
says: "I learn that a week ago the
Khalifa sent his women and treasure
from Omduram (on the Nile, opposite
Khartoum) to the south, and that
he then proceeded twenty mfloÃ north
ward to Kerreri, where the Dervish
force is assembled.
As he possessed no safe means of
advancing against Berber, the ex

Is believed he intends to operate against
our lines from the west bank of the
Nile."

DEFENDS TRUTHS
OF THE BIBLE
Grand Master Mason of New
York Dissolves the Peru
Lodge.
An Edict Removing Bibles from Ma
sonic Altars Overruled by
the Chief.
Special ninKitch to The Call.
ROCHESTER, N. V., Jan. B.â Right
Worshipful William A. Sutherland,
grand master Mason of New York
State, Issued a general edict to-day,
directed to tho masters of all the Ma
sonic lodges In the State. He dis
solves all relation with the Grand
Lodge of Peru on the ground that the
latt>-r body has, to use the word of the
official document, "committed Masonic
suicide and vsmished from existence."
He says:
"I am this day furnished with a
printed copy of an edict issued by
Christian Dam, grand secretary,
wherein the said Christian Dam, as
grand master of Masons In Peru, re
cites to those under his Jurisdiction
that according to Catholicism the Bi
ble is a sacred book in which the re
vealcl word is deposited, and as such
cannot he freely examined and criti
cised; that the Bible cannot be con
sidered as a foundation of scientific
knowledge or history nor as a basis of
morality, and he does 'decree that on
all Masonic altars the Bible shall be
removed and replaced by the constitu
tion of the order of Free Masonry, and
that in all our rituals the word â¢Bible'
shall be stricken out and the words
'thÂ« constitution of the Grand Lodge
of Peru' be put In its place.
"The body, which was the Grand
Lodge of Peru, has attempted to ac
complish that which it is not within
thf jinwor of any man or body of men
to do. In laying violent and profane
hands upon a groat light in Masonry,
it has attempted to change the plan
and very groundwork of the institu
tion. That the Bible Is a book contain
ing Bacred truth is one of the funda
mental truths of Free Masonry. How
r men differ in creed or theology,
all good men are agreed that within
the covers of the Bible are found those
principles of morality which are the
foundation upon which to build a right
eous life."

FORTY-FIVE DOLLARS A MONTH.
NEW YORK, Jan. 6.â The Sun makes
public this morning the names, rates of
pension and addresses of all pensioners
in receipt of more than $46 per month

third of one per cent of the gigantic

ture represented by this fragment of
the list is less than $2,900,000. that is to
say, about one -forty -seventh of Uw to

LIFE TERM FOR
BURGLAR ROUP
Pleads Guilty in Napa's
Court and Begs for
Mercy.
Tells of His Antecedents and
How He Became a
Criminal.
Judge Ham Unmoved by Promises
to Reformâ The Sentence Staggers
the Prisoner.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NAPA, Jan. 6.â ln the Superior Court
this morning at 10 o'clock James Roup,
the burglar, was sentenced to life im
prisonment in the San Quentin peni
tentiary. Roup, accompanied by his
attorney, John T. York, appeared in
court at the appointed hour. Being
called upon to enter his plea, the pris
oner pleaded guilty and made the fol
lowing statement:
"I Mas born in Philadelphia in 1850.
I am not a criminal at heart. I didn't
come here for the purpose of burglary.
I was broke and tried to secure work.
Failing to find any, I made up my
mind to commit a burglary and with
the money secured from the sale of the
stolen goods get out of the State.
Ever since my discharge from prison
I have been hounded and treated like
a dog.
"I readily admit that I am guilty of
thiÃ burglary, also that I served two
previous sentencesâ once from Santa
Clara County, for burglary in the first
degree, January 23, 1886, and from Sa
linas, March 24. 1890, for grand larceny.
The names I gave respectively at these
times were Charles Parker and Fred
erick Hamilton. My true name I de
clare to be James Roup. I was arrest
ed both at San Jose and Oakland for
burglary, but in each case was inno
cent and acquitted. I spent on these
two cases just $105. I am not a bad
man, and humbly I ask for leniency
fmm the court."
John T. York, attorney for the ac
cused, then arose, and after a review
of the case asked the mercy of the
court.
Judge Ham was silent for a moment
and then he commanded the prisoner
to stand up. He administered a short
but severe rebuke and ordered the de
fendant confined in the prison at San
Quentin for the term of his natural
life.
The sentence was surprising to the
defendant, who had stated that he
would become a better man after serv
ing a few years In prison. Three or
four years was all tha* he had looked
for, but previous convictions enabled
the Judge to Impose the sentence that
he did.
Sheriff McKenzie started with Roup
for San Quentin this afternoon. At
the depot in Xapa a representative of
The Call questioned Roup, who ap
peared quite angry.
"I will say that it Is my purpose to
behave well in prison," said Roup.
"But what difference does it make
whether I do or not. I am In for life,
ain't I? Your infernal paper caused
the life imprisonment I now get. That
picture you published settled my hash.
I feel no kindliness for The Call. Let
me alone, please; I am done for."
The San Joaquin authorities are no
doubt contented with the punishment
given Roup in this county. He could
not have been given more had he been
taken to Stockton.
FARMERS' HEARTS
ARE MADE GLAD
Never Was Rain More Welcome
in All Portions of the
State.
Old-Timers Were Predicting Another
Drought, but Now They Feel
More Hopeful.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, Jan. 6.â At last the much
looked-for rain has come. It began
this evening at 6 o'clock and up to 11
o'clock there was a steady downpour,
which promises to continue during the
night. Never was rain welcomed more
by the Fresno county farmers. The
season so far has been an unusually
dry one, and the farmers were begin
ning to feel very much discouraged.
They had planned to sow large acre
ages, much more than in former years,
because of the high prices prevailing.
Old-timers were predicting a dry year,
such as was experienced in the early
seventies. They say that the weather
up to the first of the year has been
identical with that of those* seasons
of the drought. The present rain Is
making the farmers feel jubilant, and
while it is late it still gives a good
prospect for next summer's harvest.
SAN JOSE, Jan. 6.â The long-con
tinued cold, dry weather has given
place to a warmer temperature and
this forenoon rain began to fall and
continues. All appearances indicate a
continuance.
SANTA CRUZ, Jan. 6.â Rain has
been falling all day in light showers,
which will prove beneficial.
SANTA ROSA, Jan. 6.â The farmers
of Sonoma County are feeling good to
day as a result of the fine rain that
came last night. Rain set In about 10
o'clock and continued until near .day
light. The rainfall for the storm Is a
quarter of an inch and for the Reason
seven and a half Inches. The rainfall
up to the same time last year was
thirteen and a half inches.
WOODLAND. Jan. 6.â Light showers
fell to-day, but the wind Is not favor
able now and a good rain is not ex
pected at present.
HOLLISTER, Jan. 6.â A rainstorm
started this evening in good earnest,
and there is every indication that it
will continue all night.
MILTON. Jan. 6.â Rain has been
falling steadily for several hours, with
indications favorable for its continu
ance during the night. The visitation
is most timely and of great value to
the country.
HANFORD. Jan. 6.â Rain com
menced falling here at 6 o'clock this
afternoon and as the sky is black with
clouds a good shower is anticipated.
This is a blessing to the farmers here
about, as so far this winter very little
rain has fallen and a dry year was
feared.
SPAIN IS WEARY
OF THE FIGHT
Willing Now to Consent
to American Medi
ation.
Will Treat for the Independence
of Cuba on Monetary
Grounds.
It Is Said Secret Negotiations Have
Already Been Begun to
This End.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO. Jan. 6.â A special to the
Tribune from Washington says: Spain
is considering a formal request to the
United States to use its good offices to
stop the fighting in Cuba,
Intimations have been received at the
State Department that the Sagasta
Government has become convinced that
the only way to save Cuba is to ac
cept the often proffered good offices of
the United States. Canovas repeatedly
replied to President Cleveland declining
these good offices, and Sagasta did the
same last November. Now the Prime
Minister has become completely dis
heartened over the evident failure of
autonomy. All the efforts of Spain to
bribe the subordinates of Gomez to sur
render on the basis of home rule have
proven futile. Blanco has completely
failed in his efforts to open up commu
nication with the insurgents, and Pan
do has likewise been defeated in the
field. The Spanish Minister now feels
that the only thing left is to accept the
good offices of Uncle Sam in spite of
the humiliation involved.
They hesitate only because they feel
that a public announcement of this
fact would result in a revolution in
Spain. Secret negotiations with the
State Department are now actually in
progress. The Spanish Government
has lost the confidence of the loyalists
in Cuba, and it recognizes the fact that
the island itself is lost entirely unless
the country will at this late day nego
tiate with the insurgents for some
basis of peace. The Spanish propose
that the United States should offer
to t'ne insurgents an actual armistice
pending negotiations for peace on the
basis of American guarantees of the
integrity of home rule, or even of in
dependence on a monetary considera
tion.
While no such formal proposition has
been made by Minister Do Lome, the
State Department has been given to
understand that only the fear of revo
lution in Spain stands in the way now
of accenting the friendly offices of the
United States which have been rejected
so often.
It has been intimated that if this
country sees fit on its own motion to
open up communication with the in
surgents Spain will not throw any ob
jections in the way. Any such move
would be a practical recognition of the
insurgents rb belligerents, but things
have reached such a crisis in Cuba that
even this contingency must be faced.
It is understood that the Cuban re
public will insist on formal recognition
before undertaking any negotiations
with the United States, claiming that
it cannot treat with a power which re
gards it only as an organized conspir
acy of riot and piracy. The situation
is critical in Cuba, and the frequent
visits of the Spanish Minister to the
State Department are sufficient indi
cation that the Spanish empire in Cuba
is almost at an end.
Officials here are inclined tn the be
lief that the public announcement of
the acceptance of this country as a
mediator will result in instant revolu
tion in Spain, but they admit it is the
last hope, and is being seriously con
sidered.
NEW CATHOLIC SCHOOL FOR FRESNO.
Handsome Property Bought by Sisters of
the Holy Cross.
FRESNO, Jan. 6.â The Sisters of the
Holy Cross who conduct the St. Augus
tine Academy in this city have pur
chased the handsome residence prop
erty of William M. Williams at the
corner of R and Mariposa streets for
the purpose of establishing the Catholic
school there. The deal was consum
mated to-day. The area of the ground
is 150 by 150 feet.
The thirteen-room residence will be
used as the dormitory and a commo
dious school building will be erected
adjoining. The academy is at present
occupying a two-story frame structure
next to the Catholic cnurch, but the
school has grown so that the present
quarters are much too small. Last
summer the Catholics purchased prop
erty on N street, and just after the
buildings had been erected they were
destroyed by fire.
GRIFFITH IS FOUND GUILTY.
SANTA ROSA, Jan. 6.â Shortly be

ion as to the recent dispatch from
Washington to the effect that the fall

America would not be unwelcome to

that a positive statement from Wash

have the effect of weakening the unicn'
Central Americans, he said, are now
convinced that he republic is nothing
less than a myth; that it is merely an
alliance of President Zelaya, Bonllla

themselves in power. This alliance, he
further stated, was made despite the
fact that the three Presidents are at
swords' points and that the greatest
enmity exists between the three re
publics. My informant stated further
that it is a matter of surprise that a
revolution has not broken out In Sal

seven months the opposition to Guiter
rez has been actively at work prepar
ing plans to overthrow the President,
owing to his maladministration.

Introduces a Bill Appro

Dollars.
This to Be Ussd in Dredging

Tributaries.
Construction of Needed Impounding
Dams In the Yuba Also Being
Considered.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office. Riggs House,
Washington, Jan. 6.
Representative deVries to-day tntro
i In the House a bill appropriating
.000 for dredging and otherwise im
vlng the Sacramento River and its
uarles. The object of this bill is
Lrry out the engineers' recommen
â¢ in for the improvement of the Sac
ra ineoto River, recently submitted.
De Vri^a considers that the greatest
obstacle to the improvement of the
Sacramento River and its tributaries
has been removed, and a great step In
advance in that matter has been ac-
romplished. He has devoted a great
deal of time in bringing influence to
â ;'. bear upon the departmental officers to j
show the necessity of early action by I
the California Debris Commission in
submitting plans for the improvement
.-. of the Sacramento and its tributaries,
.' and for the construction of impound- ;
V l-ng dams in the Tuba River, as pre- j
' viously required by Congress. The !
greatest difficulty in securing an ap- I
pmpriation has now been overcome by j
this Representative.
De Vries said to-nisrht that every ef- i
fort should now be directed toward se
curing this appropriation and the report
from the engineers of plans for the Im
pounding dam in the Yuba River, as
â¢ the latter is absolutely essential to any
complete system for the improvement
of the Sacramento River. He speaks
in high terms of Chief of Engineers

ORDERED TO REFUND
HIS PERQUISITES
Los Angeles Grand Jury Settles
a Point With Regard
to Fees.
The County Auditor la Required to
Dip Into His Pocket
for $230.
Pp^'a! Dinratch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 6.â County
; Auditor E. C. Hodgman has been call
ed to order by the Grand Jury and a
; demand made upon him to refund
.- . something like $250, which he failed to
.'.turn over to the County Treasurer in
â '.. the way of fees received by him in his !
â A capacity for recording mineral'
s. Until recently the fee for re
â :ing a mineral claim was 50 cents,
n ! -\ hen received it was entered in
â  regular way upon the feebook of
â¢.jL-the Recorder's office. But Hodgman i
'ygot the Idea that for some reason the |
â¢â¢fee was a perquisite of his office and j
..â¢â¢tie asked the District Attorney for his
V ":\opinic>n. That official furnished It to j
â  ' ; the effect that the fee was properly a
A.' perquisite of the Recorder's and that
â¢ .-.he therefore need make no entry of it
;â¢â¢â¢â  upon his feebook. The District Attor
-. ney based his decision upon a case de
â¢â ;- J cided in the Superior Court of San j
. I 'â¢â â rnardino County.
Then, it Is alleged. Recorder Hodg
n raised the fee for recording min
eral claims to $1. He had been collect- i
[i lt only 50 cents for the county, but j
).'â  wanted SI when he found that It |
was his. The Grand Jury examined j
into the matter, and. In the face of
â  tho District Attorney's opinion that !
th>- Recorder was entitled to the fee,
they demanded that all amounts
Hodgman had collected for the filing I
of mineral claims should be promptly
t: irnr-d into the county treasury and
(tcoounted for In the feebook.
Mr. Hodgman promptly complk-d i
with the demand, and therefore no
proceedings will be instituted against
him. Hodgman claims that if the Dis
trict Attorney had not advised him
that he was entitled to the fee he never
would have retained it.

an Original Black
mailer.
The Scoundrel Now In Prison
for Using the Mails to
Defraud.
Run Down by United States Postoffice
Inspector Flint at 1-os
Angeles.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 6.â United
States Postofflce Inspector Martley H.
Flint has landed A. M. Williams, head
of the Inter-State Detective Bureau
of Riverside, behind the bars on a
charge of using the malls to defraud.
Williams had a unique and novel
scheme of blackmail and extortion by
means of which he has for some time
been enabled to make a living and to
dupe a great many people in different
parts of California and the entire
West. His proposition was intricate â
so much so that the officers were for
some weeks at a loss to understand
how the man made any money by his
knavery His plan was to work on the
cupidity of people by sending them a
letter, which, they would see on open-
Ing, was not intended for them,
but which, it seemed, presented
them a means of getting some money
belonging suppoeably to some one else
of the same name. Then, after they
had so far committed themselves by
keeping and replying to the letter, the
schemer would attempt to extort
money from them on the threat of ex
posure. In the case which came to the
attention of the authorities the swin-

dler, one A. M. Williams, sent the fol
lowing letter under Riverside date to
W. F. Baker at Banning:
Dear Husband: I Inclose to you here
with Mr. Hoyt's note of $150. Mr. Hoyt
wants to pay the note before due, and
was quite disappointed when he called
yesterday and found that I would not
accept payment and give up thÂ«- note
until it became due, or at least until I
had consulted first with you. Now if
you think best to accept payment and
give up the note, then return the note to
me so that I may collect thft money from
Mr. Hoyt and send it at once to you, be
cause I suspect you need it. Mother is
more down on you than ever, if possible,
and she has Just marie a. new will, giv
ing me her entire estate provided I get a
divorce from you within a year after her
death, otherwise Uncle Henry and
Cousin Julia get it all. Lawyer Jones
tells me that I can get a divorce from
you on the ground of desertion and se
cure my inheritance; then we can marry
again and thus evade poor mother's
cruel will. The doctors all say that she
can hold out but a few months longer at
most, and the best we can do, dear hus
band, is to humor poor mother's peculiar
whim for the time.
I have not heard from you since you
left Charlies, and this is my first letter
to you at your new address. Oh, how
lonesome I do get in this big house
without you. and life is such a mo
notony here, alone with mother, that I
am almost tempted to begin typewriting
again for Armstrong & Co. Address all
your letters to A. M. "Williams, River
side, Cal., then I can call for them with
out much danger of mother seeing
them. Hoping this will find you, like
myself in the b^st of health, but in
better spirits, I am. as ever, your faith
ful wlfeT MARY A. BAKER.
Baker was an honest man and
turned the letter he received over to
the postal authorities.
This was all the authorities required.
Williams was arrested at once. His
room was searched and it was dis
covered that he had sent out over 100
similar letters and was receiving
many replies a day. It was evident
that he had terrorized a number of
people into paying him in each case $50
blackmail. A full supply of paper bear
ing the letterhead of the detective
agency and a quantity of incriminat
ing evidence was found.

CAUSED BY
AN ARC LAMP
The Fall of One Started
Three Fires on the
Front
Telephone Wires Between Here
and Oakland Burned
Out.
A Rush of Boys Anxious to Ship on
the Mohican at the Naval
Rendezvous.
The fall of an arc light on "Washing
ton street wharf nearly caused three
serious fires and cut the water front
and Oakland off from telephonic com
munication last evening. When the
arc light fell the wires became discon
nected, but the current was turned into
the telephone wires aÂ£ the Tiburon
ferry, section 1 of the sea wall, and
at the foot of Market street. At the
sea wall the grain shed caught flre,
but a few buckets of water put the
blaze out. At the Tiburon ferry all the
company's Sunset wires were burnt
out and Oakland was only reached
thereafter by way of San Jose. The
pole on which the wires rested caught
fire and also the ferry waiting room.
A still alarm was turned in and the
danger of a blaze was soon over.
Double forces of men are at work re
pairing the damage and everything
will be in good order again this morn-
Ing.
The electric light people are of the
opinion that some person on mischief
bent caused all the trouble. The arc
light on Washington street wharf is
lowered and raised by means of a rope
and pulleys. When the cleaner fin
ishes his morning work on the lamp he
hauls It into position and fastens it
securely. Some one must have loos
ened the rope and let the lamp dowr>
with a run. The wharf was crowded
with teams at the time and the falling
lamp nearly caused a stampede among
the huis.-s.
The Harbor Commissioners held a
short session yesterday and paid the
Risdon Iron Works the balance of its
contract price for the iron work on the
new ferry depot. The check was for
$25,950, and is the second largest ever
drawn by the commission.
The sanitary reduction works will be
awarded a wharf at which it can
dump garbage into scows as soon as
the Board of Health nas paused upon
the matter, and not until then. Presi
dent Colnon gave that out as the final
decision of the Board yesterday. It,
therefore, looks as though the sani
tary reduction works will have to ob
tain some other water front facilities
than those controlled by the board, as
the managers of the concern stated
positively at the last meeting of the
commission that they would under no
consideration appear before the Board
of Health and ask for a permit.
The work of putting ferry slip 5 In
repair is to be rushed in order to have
it in readiness for the rush to the
races at Oakland, which begin next
Monday. President Colnon will see to
it that extra men are put to work on
the job, and that everything will be
in readiness for an extra boat on Mon-
day.
Boys anxious to Jo4n the navy as ap
prentices pour Into the rendezvous on
California street In dozens dally. Fully
fifty boys present themselves daily for
examination, but out of that number
only about three out of every ten are
accepted, the others failing to pass the
physical test. The trip around the
world in the Mohican has turned near
ly every boy in the State into a would
be sailor, and all are more than anx
ious to tnke a four years* course in
seamanship. '"Tommy" Reynolds, who
lives on Natoma street, Is one of the
boys who will not take "no" for an an
swer. Tommy lacks an inch and a
quarter of the necessary height, and
every day he pops to the rendezvous
and measures himself to see how much
he has grown. The officers in charge
of tho enlisting of the boys have taken
a great liking to the lad, and tf It can
be managed in any way "Tommy" will
be aboard when the Mohican sails. The
following officers have been assigned
to the training ship: G. M. Brock,
commander; Lieutenant J. D. McDon
ald, Lieutenants H. M. Dombaugh, M.
L. Wood and T. Porter, and Ensigns
H. Laning. G. K. GMm and C. J. Lang,
now on the receiving ship Independ
ence at Mare Island.
The Pacific Mail Company's steamer
China sailed for the Orient yesterday
with only six passengers, but a full
cargo, C. H. Brickwrdel Jr., the purser
of the steamer, is on the sick list and
did not go out this voyage. His place
was taken by C. M. Wilbur.

THE SOUTH AND THE FAIR.
COMMENTING upon the celebration of the
Golden Jubilee and the coming mining ex
position the Redlands Citrograph expresses
the belief that these things will be good for San
Francisco, but asks "Where does South California
get off?"
Answering the question according to its own no
tion, it says: "South California has not one particle
of direct benefit to gain through this proposed fiesta
and but the merest trifle in indirect benefit." Then
to prove the truth of this extraordinary assertion it
adds: "Days and nights have we sat in the Occi
dental, the Grand, the Palace and other hotels in
San Francisco and told mining men of experience
of the vast mineral wealth of South California, not
alone gold, but silver, and iron, and borax, and salt,
and asbestos, and laminar mica, and petroleum and
asphalt and many other mineral and non-mineral
substances, and have been met with contempt that
we could be crazy enough or ignorant enough not
to know that the 'mother lode" â whatever that may
be â 'broke off' some 300 miles north of here and no
precious metals ever were or ever could be tound
south of that 'well defined' point. And San Fran
cisco does not to-day recognize South California
as a gold or silver producing region."
If any considerable number of people in the
south hold the dolorous creed propounded by the
Citrograph they wall come near proving the asser
tion that South California wiil have no benefit from
the mining exposition by the simple neglect to seize
the beneficial opportunities offered. In the swift ad
vance of the State in all lines of enterprise at the
beginning of the new era of prosperity there will be
no inclination on the part of any to stop and con
dole with those who stand aside to criticize or
swear. Prosperity will be only for those who join
the movement and keep up with the procession.
The editor of the Citrograph has been unfortunate
if in sitting in the hotels of San Francisco he has
found no man who would take an interest or place
confidence in his stories of the bountiful mineral
resources of the south. Perhaps if he had made his
talk in places where San Franciscans resort to do
business instead of in the lounging places of the
hotels where rural roosters come to acquire style
and have adventures he would have had better luck.
There is many a capitalist in this city who has made
investments in the south and found them profitable,
and reports of their experience have made the wealth
of that section better known here than the Citro
graph thinks.
If, however, San Francisco people are really ig
norant of the extent of the richness of the southern
mines it is surely time for the southern people to
enlighten them. Nothing can be gained by sitting
down on undeveloped mines and swearing at met
ropolitan ignorance. The only proper course to
pursue is for the south to send to the mining expo
sition such an array of exhibits as will open our
eyes to the truth and excite our minds with ad
miration. If this is done there will be no further
question as to where South California is to get off.
She will not get off at all, but catch on, 6tay on and
share in all the benefits the new gold excitement
promises to every enterprising and rich mining dis
trict on the Pacific Coast.
An unknown man has been killed at Martinez by
an officer. His crime was that of being a tramp.
In the category of crimes there are worse offenses.
A tramp has even been known to be such against
his own desire and in spite of desperate effort. The
officer may have been justifiable, however, for
tramps do questionable things occasionally, and yet
the chances are that the slayer would be sleeping
more soundly o' nights if he had not felt impelled
to take a life which seemed to him at the time to be
of little value.
That one member of the Salvation Army at San
Bernardino turns out to be a burglar is no possible
reflection upon the organization. But his haste to
be convicted so as to return and resume the preach
ing of the gospel will hardly appeal to people of
reason. Doubtless he has a mission, but it seems
to be that of posing as the necessary "terrible ex
ample."
According to college authority the recent killing
of Mamvell on the football field will have no effect
on the game. The view is hardly correct. Mr.
Manwell will no longer participate in the chaste joys
of the gridiron, and some who saw him killed
will remember the circumstance to the dampening
of their enthusiasm.
Actor Ratcliffe, who was in jail for the beating
of his wife, has established a reasonable doubt and
is at liberty. There had been before a very reason
able doubt, but this was as to whether the sentence
given, being only six months, was long enough.
REFORM THE CRIMINAL CODE.
THE Durrant case has gained such wide no
toriety and the vicissitudes and changes which
it has undergone have been so dramatic that
it may be made to serve some purpose besides that
of satisfying the unwholesome taste for the morbid
and abnormal.
For nearly three years some phase of this case
has been before the public. Of that necessity which
cannot be avoided, it has been in some form in
every newspaper. In some of them, however, it has
appeared with unnecessary frequency, or has been
written up so as to wring from it every possible ab
normal and crime breeding suggestion of which it
was capable. It has been used in pictures and text
by such papers with an ingenuity sometimes hellish
to touch into diseased and dreadful activity any
;erms of erotic crime that might be latent in the
community. These papers have reveled in the
spume and feculence and foulness of it and have
scattered broadcast every suggestion which can
serve as a mental ferment for the perversion and
undoing of the weak and wayward. The case has
been made to be a moral pestilence, a psychopathic
infection, incapable of being quarantined and
against which no lustration could prevail as long as
the sensational press had the excuse of parading it
as news because of its constant recurrence in the
courts.
Observing this, those members of the community
who have noted the spread of moral gangrene,
losing their judgment, have accused the courts of
being the septic centers of the contagion, and the
bench has lost standing as a result. Probably no
ither matter ever made the subject of judicial inves-
tigation has inflicted as much harm in the form of
damage to morals and loss of respect due to the
courts as this. Therefore, before the lesson passes
and is overgrown by some other grewsome sensa
tion let the only possible virtuous use be made of
it. The courts are not to blame. They are created
to administer the civil and criminal code. The
rights of a man accused of crime begin in the Fed
eral constitution and lie embedded in the statutes.
These being constitutional, the courts are bound by
them. If a lawyer choose to use his case as an ad-
vertisement of his aptness in getting time, gaining
delay and balking justice in a labyrinth of techni
calities, armed with the Criminal Code he has the
courts at his mercy. He has also the admiration of
a certain section of the community if his case be
capital and capital punishment be hanging. So it
happens that not only in California, but in other
States, justice lags. The tenderness shown by the
law for the innocent, falsely accused, has erected a
system of statutes and produced a line of decisions
which render punishment of the guilty difficult and
tedious.
Those who make it their business to decry and
defame the Federal courts have fed their grudge on
the Durrant case. But those courts cannot bar the
presentation of a case before them, nor can they in
the first instance, if a Federal question be alleged,
prevent an appeal to test its existence.
Without at present pointing out the particulars
in which amendments to the statutes may b>s had,
we call attention to the need of such statutory re
form as will repress crime by its prompt punish
ment rather than encourage it by delays which the
innocent do not need, but which avail the guilty in
various ways and recruit the criminal ranks by sug
gestion.
The ends of justice and the ends of morality are to
be served by such reform. In not a single aspect
is crime a desirable presence. Neither in repen
tance nor in punishment does it teach. "The way
of the transgressor is hard" may be written on the
lintel of every prison and carved on every gallows,
and yet that way will be trodden to the end by
those who believe themselves exceptions to the
hard rule that has dominated those gone before in
the same path.
Moral diseases have their origin in pathogenic
germs as certainly as do physical disorders. We ex
pend large sums in the sanitation of our cities, the
destruction of foul and noisome things and in a
proper drainage and disinfection of sewage that the
germs of fever may be prevented.
The purpose of the Criminal Code should largely
be a moral sanitation. Give the wrongly accused
opportunity to prove his innocence, but when judg
ment has fallen upon the guilty put the noisome
matter away; get it out of sight and out of mind
and thereby purify and keep clean the minds in
which the subtlest of natural laws has , lodged the
capacity to catch disorders by contact
HOT TIMES FOR PENSION ATTORNEYS.
UNLESS all indications fail, one of the liveliest
fights in Washington this winter will be made
over the alleged "pension scandals," with
pension attorneys in the middle of the scrimmage
catching kicks and licks from both sides. H. Clay
Evans, Commissioner of Pensions, desires the pas
sage of a law to the effect that in future no fee shall
be paid to any attorney or claim agent for any
claim filed for pensions, and as he is reputed to be
a good hard fighter the chances are he will either
get such a law or know the reason why.
In a recent statement on the subject Mr. Evans
says: "The ordinary pension attorney is worse than
the most pestiferous 'varmint' that ever invaded a
hen roost." It should be remembered that Mr.
Evans is a resident of Tennessee and in that State
the word "varmint" is not libelous. At most the
pestiferous creature referred to in the simile could
be only a coon, a possum or a skunk, and as the
phrase is expressly applied not ta extraordinary
attorneys, but only to the ordinary ones, there can
be nothing in the epithet which a jury would con
sider derogatory to the reputation of the person
accused.
Passing from phrases to facts, the Commissioner
asserts that under the present law the Government
virtually pays a bounty of $25 to the pension attor
ney for every pensioner who can be induced to file
a claim that can be proven up and admitted. Under
this system there have gone into the business up
ward of 50,000 pension attorneys, and according to
Mr. Evans "they are practically so many drum-
mers â soliciting agents â that do nothing but hunt
up claims and claimants for the Pension Bureau,"
The country will be glad to have this issue
probed and thoroughly investigated by a Republi
can administration. The work of reforming abuses
in the system, if abuses exist, should be entrusted to
the party that framed the pension laws and is known
to be loyal to the brave men who saved the Union
at the peril of their lives. The pension roll was de
signed to be a roll of honor and should be kept so.
Henry Clay Evans is one of the men who fought
for the nation during the war and after its close
went South to maintain the cause of reconstruction
and liberty against Bourbon hate and intolerance.
He has shown himself to be a faithful and coura
geous man in many posts of duty, and if he has

now good reason for believing that the honorable
pensions bestowed by a grateful country upon de
serving veterans are being distorted to the use of
fraudulent claimants the sympathy and support of
the people will be with him in his new contest to
uphold the right and redress the wrong.
AS a general thing it is useless to argue with
a newspaper whose purposes are insincere.
The Mission street boodler is anxious to get
a "cinch" into the proposed new charter which will
compel the Southern Pacific to offer it another "ad
vertising" contract. It is aware of the fact that the
corporation never advertises unless coerced, and it
knows of no better way to coerce it than to secure
the adoption of a provision in the charter which will
threaten to confiscate its property. Hence the sup
port it is giving to the proposition to forfeit, upon
their expiration; the franchises of the Market street
railway system.
In an attempt to show this boodle sheet that it
is throwing its energy away we said the other day
that no such "cinch" could be valid for the reason
that, being in conflict with a State statute providing
for the sale of railroad franchises, it would be un
constitutional. Our motive was kindly. Having
no objection to the boodle sheet again entering the
employ of the railroad monopoly, we intended
merely to direct its mind into more promising chan
nels, for it is certain that it will never get another
"advertising" contract by threatening the forfeiture
of the franchises of the Market street company.
But our kindness seems to have been misplaced.
The boodler denounces us as a corporation organ
and says that we know less law than necessity,
which knows no law.
Nevertheless, we must insist that the boodler is
wasting its time. Section Bof article XI of the con
stitution provides that "any city * * * may frame
a charter for its own government consistent with
and subject to the constitution and laws of this
State," etc. This section has never been modified
or repealed. The amendment of 1895, providing
that charters shall be supreme in "municipal af
fairs." does not apply. Selling railroad franchises
is not a municipal affair. The State owns the
streets. At common law the King held the fee
simple of all the highways, and our King is the
State. The use of the streets and the authority to
improve and maintain them is granted to the city
by the State, which creates the city and from which
it derives all its powers. The State having passed
an act establishing a uniform rule for the sale of
railroad franchises covering its own property, all
charters must be consistent with it. In the case of
Davies vs. the city of Los Ajigeles the Supreme
Court decided that the charter of that city must be
controlled by a general law providing for the open
ing, widening and extending of streets. Why must
not the charter of this city be controlled by a general
law for the sale of railway franchises?
But of what use is it to call the Mission street
boodler's attention to law? The last things in the
world it cares about are statutes and Supreme Court
decisions. What it wants is a "cinch" which will
compel the railroad monopoly to "advertise." The
recollection of that $30,000 contract must linger in
its memory as the perfume of new-blown roses is
said to hang around Prradise.
However, there is no question whatever that in
this matter of franchises the boodler i< wasting its
words. That matter contains none of the elements
of a good "cinch." The power to make it effective
does not reside in the Board of Freeholders, but in
the Legislature. The corporation attorneys, of
whom it occasionally speaks with so much re
spect, are undoubtedly laughing at its ignorance.
What the boodler should do is to go for the water
and gas companies. Is it aware of the fact that
Spring Valley is earning 6 per cent on its stock and
that last year the Gas Company paid a million dol
lars in dividends? The Market street company
earns only a miserable 25 cents a share, and that not
more than once in three months. The boodler
ought not to desire to fleece the poor.
For men who deliberately sell diseased meat to
the community no adequate punishment has yet
been devised. That morally they are on the plane of
the murderer there can be no question, but the dif
ficulty of tracing any particular homicide to them is
apparent. To make them pay a fine out of their ill
got money falls far short of justice. At least the
fine imposed should be so great that no man-killing
butcher could possibly pay it. and in lieu of satis
fying the demand would have to spend in jail the
rest of his unnatural days.
While the threat of one city official to pull off the
nose of another naturally sent a thrill of horror
through the community, there is comfort in know
ing that the nose is still in place. The dove of
peace lost a few feathers, but this seems to have
been the extent of the catastrophe.
When Secretary Gage has retired and Secretary
Sherman has retired there will be a chorus of "I
told you so's" of impressive volume. But if neither
of them leaves the Cabinet the silence of the
prophets will be worth listening to.
To the unbiased observer it does not seem that
putting handcuffs on a schoolboy so as to be able
with a minimum of discomfort to give him a beat
ing is a plan which ought to be allowed to be
habitually followed.
The public will be relieved to know that the in
terviews yellow journalism is presenting as coming
from Durrani are absolutely fictitious.

Ignorance of American affairs, says the Illustrated
American.
Some of the mistakes made by leading and in
fluential Journals on the other side of the water in
expatiating upon American problems are too absurd
even to be classed in the category Of humor. In this
Connection it is intcrestlnc to quote, some few ex
tracts from the. Petit Parlslen. This n.-wspaper is
published in Paris, and has a daily circulation of
fcOG.OOO copies, buch a newspaper may not improperly
be taken as a fair exponent of Parisian sentiment.
With respect to the war power of the United States
this paragraph occurs in the paper: "The United
Ptates has no war power. Its navy is composed of a
few modern ships, which cannot put out to sea, and
Its army, or. rather, what is so called, is made up of
a great many generals and a few negro and Indian
troops, without arms or discipline." The Parlsien de
clares that "either Japan or Spain would find the task
of vanquishing the presumptuous Yankee easy
enough."
Such ignorance as statements like these clearly
Imply is without excuse, even among the lowest clasa
of Europeans who never travel and know but little
of what is going on in and around them. But for utter
nonsense this statement caps the climax: "Canada
Is, indeed a great country, and it might well be
proud or having been the birthplace of the patriot,
George Washington." Still another exhibition of
European Ignorance is disclosed In the following
paragraph: "The city of Eureka Springs, one of the
piost beautiful towns of fur Arkansas, lies on a beau

fact that the United States is confessedly one of the

catch the public ear, never failed to re
mind the people of the State that the
Normal Schools were unable to supply
the demand for teachers.
Now every Trustee or Director whoso
duty it Is to employ teachers has every
reason to believe quite the contrary, and
if Mr. Black will give us the facts upon
which he based this assertion the people
may become convinced.
It certainly cannot be that Mr. Black
has been called upon for teachers and
that he and the principals of the differe'it
Normal Schools have been unable to re
spond to these calls by giving them the
names of one or more good and worthy
teachers. If so, these gentlemen at the
heads of education in the State need only
to call on any School Board. My expe
rience assures me that every board in
the State has enough teachers on its sub
stitute list to fill all the vacancies that
will occur during the next ten years, and
besides the names of enough proficient
and worthy applicants whose letters are
filed away to nil all the vacancies for a
succeeding ten years. Mr. Black ana
the principals ought to know that e"ory
year School Boards are beset with appli
cants in such numbers and to such a tie â¢
gree as to make them feel like hiding
themselves away from home to avoifl
meeting applicants only to say "We have
no place for you." Nor can these wor
thy educators claim that the unsuccess
ful candidates for teachers' positions are
unfit for the places. On the contrary,
they are oftentimes more competent
than those now occupying the position-?.
Now either Mr. Black and the princi
pals or the people who employ teacher 3
are v.holly ignorant of the fao"s in the
case In the light of the taxpayer and
of the School Trustee I believe that
there are now too many Normal Schools
and too many teachers. If the Normal
Schools made only good teachers they
would still have capacity to sup^iy more
than are required. For almos*. every
place in the business world there are two
persons who could fill it. and for every
vacancy there are a hundred applicants.
Do the people of the State want to bur
den themselves with additional taxes, to
throw more and more people into the
ranks of a profession already very much
overcrowded?
It is all very well for a man to be en
thusiastic in his profession and want to
establish more Normals, but we have
heard so much of it of late that to School
Boards at least it is becoming slightly
nauseating, and the only thing that will
cure the nausea is to hear no more of it
or hear from Mr. Black some facts to
convince us that the stand he has taken
is based on reasonable and sufficient
grounds. It is one thing to make an as
sertion and quite another to establish its
harmony with the facts in the case
Do we need more teachers? No. most
certainly not. Then we surely do not
need more Normal Schools except it be
to create positions for the teachers al
ready out of employment. Yours respect
fully. S. H. STRILE.

Company.
GOTTLOB'S COOL HEAD.
He Dismissed the People Because
"One of the Leading Actors
Was Sick."
It was but the providential interven
tion of time â and very short time at
that â that saves the recording this
morning of a calamity the very thought
of which causes a shudder.
Fire started in the Columbia Theater
20 minutes before 8 o'clock last evening,
and within five minutes the whole audi
torium was filled with dense, suffocating
s-moke.
Had it been half an hour later there
would have been a thousand or more
â men and women struggling in mad
panic in their efforts to escape almost
certain deatli and to-day San Francisco
would have been a city of mourning.
â  With the acrid, poisonous gases pour
â  ing in densr volumes from the burning
wood work it is marvelous that the few
who were in the building were not
asphyxiated, and what would have oc
curred with the theater filled with a
large audience can only be left to spec
ulation, with the grateful feeling that a
merciful dispensation of providence
stood between the people and an awful
calamity.
While the managers of the theater
have suffered a great financial loss, they
and the people have reasons for con
gratulation in that there was neither the
lo=> of life nor physical suffering which
wou'.u have been entailed had there
beeii a short delay in the time of the
conflagration.
But there is a gay as well as a grave
side to this casualty, and what might
have been a public calamity now affords
food for jest with Matthews and Bul
ger as the butts of the pleasantries.
These gentlemen were in grotesque
costumes ready to go on the stage
when the alarm was given and they
rushed madly forth to meet the jeers
'and jokes of their friends, as they pre
sented the contrast of frightened se
riousness garbed in the ludicrous hab
iliment 5 ; of mirth.
The blaze started on the top floor of
the building, which is used as a lodg
ing-house, and. according to Captain
Comstoek of the underwriters, it was
caused by an electric wire.
About twenty minutes before 8 o'clock
one of the performers connected with
the "Gay Coney Island" show, which
â was on the boards at the Columbia,
'<Â»d smoke in his dressing-room.
H* 3 at once summoned the other mera-
;â¢ bers of the company, and, after a hur
â  ried consultation, they sent for Fred

'"â .. the stage he detected the smell of

with smoke, and an alarm of fire was
sent in from box 47. Scarcely had the
district engines reached the scene
when Chief Sullivan, fearing that the
building would be destroyed, turned in
a second alarm. The entire roof was
ablaze, and for a time the flames
threatened to communicate to the ad
joining buildings. Armed with axes
the firemen entered the building and
vainly endeavored to chop away the
burning roof. Realising that a con
flagration was imminent. Chief Sulli
van ordered the water tower truck to
take up a position in front of the the
ater. The Immense stream from the
tower was then brought into play, and
in a short time the blaze was extin
guished.
Captain Comstock estimates the loss
at about $25,000, principally due to
water. The water from the tower
streamed through the roof, destroying
the furniture In the lodging house,
damaging the chairs in the theater and
playing sad havoc with the fixtures and
bar of the Auditorium saloon, which is
adjoining the theater.
The losses as estimated by Captain
Comstock are as follows:
Damage to the lodging house by fire
and water, $3000.
Damage to the Auditorium saloon,
$5000.
Damage to the theater by fire and
water, $10,000.
Damage to the building by fire and
water, $8000.
The people connected with the the
ater deny that the building caught fire
from an electric wire. They strongly
believe that it was due to a defective
flue between the Columbia building
and the St. Ann's building, which ad
joins it on the south.
After the firemen entered the thea
ter they discovered a volume of smoke
pouring through the south wall of the

gallery. Cutting away a portion of the
wall, they discovered the cause of the
smoke. The fire had crept along the
wall of the theater and was eating its
way to the gallery. After covering the
furniture of the theater with tarpau
lins, Chief Sullivan ordered his men
to cut away the portion of the w;tl!
which was on fire. A hose was then
run into the theater and a stream
played on the burning embers.
When the first cry of lire was raised
there was considerable excitement be
hind the scenes. The performers were
"making up" for their various parts in
their respective dressing rooms. When
the smoke was discovered the women
members of the company became
alarmed and started to leave, unmind
ful of their stage costumes.
One of them in her haste to escape
from the burning building ran out, her
stage wig tightly clutched in one hand
and a powder rag in the other..
The men remained perfectly cool,
and greatly assisted the women in
moving their effects to a place of
safety. .
THE SAX YJI AXCTSCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 7, 1898.
Fred Meyer, the janitor, says he was
walking down the main aisle of the
theater when he detected the smell of
smoke.
"Realizing that something WM
wrong," he said, when relating his ex
perience after the flames were extin
guished, "I jumped on the stai:<j and
entered the wings." The members of
the company had also discovered the
smoke, and Bfceined to be alarmed evec
it. I told them not to get excited,
and leaving the stage I informed Mr.
Gottlob. There were not many people
in the audience, as it was two early
to put in an appearance. Mr. Gottlob
made a nice speech to the few people
who were present, in which he said
that one of the members of the com
pany was sick, and for that reason
there would be no performance. They
then filed out of the theater, and it
was not until the alarm was rung in
and the engines rattled up to the
building that it dawned upon them
that a fire was in progress.
"After they had lift 1 went upstairs
to see if I could discover the cause of
the smoke. After considerable trouble
I discovered the blase between the two
walls. I quickly got a bucket of water,
but finding efforts useless I ordered one
of the men who was with me to turn
in the fire alarm.
"I am firmly convinced that the fire
was due to a flue which is situated on
the south wall of the building. As soon
as I saw that a serious fire was im
minent I aroused the roomers in the
lodging-house and told them of their
danger. Some of the women ran from
the house without stopping to take
their personal property. one young
woman was en deshabille when I in
formed her of the tire, and notwith
standing my protest she started to
leave. A friend, who also .roomed in
the house, promptly seized her and
forced her to don her clothes."
Andrew Wood, one of the proprietors
of the Auditorium saloon, was one of
the first to discover the' fire. He was
standing in his saloon when he noticed
smoke arising from a "dummy" waiter
which is in the rear of the place.
t"It "I first thought that the smoke whs
coming from the restaurant under
neath," he said last night, "but as it
seemed to grow in volume I concluded
to make an investigation. Looking up
the chute through which the 'dummy
waiter* runs I was nearly evercome by
smoke. Hushing up stairs I saw that
the building was on fire and raised an
alarm. Fortunately the flames did
not reach the saloon, but we no doubt
had a narrow escape. The water from
the tower poured into the saloon, and
despite the usÂ« of tarpaulins, created
sad havoc. The damage done by the
water, however, is fully covered by in
surance."
It is said that there were forty room
ers in the lodging house, who were
damaged from $25 to $100 each.
This will increase the total loss to
about $28,000 or $30,000.
Friedlander, Gottlob & Company
have arranged to transfer all their
cemiÃg Columbia Theater attractions
to the California Theater until the
former house is entirely repaired. "At
day Coney Island," which has been
playing at the Columbia, will open at
the California Theater on Saturday
night. A special matinee will be given
on Sunday afternoon and a fin.il per
formance on Sunday night. The en
tire scenery, costumes, etc., have been
saved. Nellie McHenry, in "A Night
in New York." will open at the Cali
fornia Theater Monday. Those per
sons holding seats for the remaining
performances of "At Gay Coney
Island" at the Columbia can have their
money refunded or seats exchanged
for the California.
For a time the building seemed like
an island in itself as the water poured
down from above, and a scene could
hardly be described which would be
more realistic of a theatrical company
on a wet day. When the smoke was
first seen by the members of the
troupe the men rushed heroically to the
assistance of the ladies, but in the long
run they had to help the male members
pack their grips and give them well
timed advice as to the amount of time
i they would have In leaving the build
ing.
Mathews, who takes the part of
Payne in the performance and is sup
posed to take things easy, swallowed
smoke, which pained him, and he did
not carry out his part, but took things
uneasily. Harry Bulger dropped his
plumbing set in the .Iressing-room and
followed. At this point the ladies were
thought of, ;iikl Mathews returned, but
r would not budge from the front
do. >r. which he had reached in safety.
All performers in the piece forgot
their lines and reversed the part they
take before the footlights, with the ex
ception of Thomas Brans, who shaves
all those who will Ptnnd It nightly. He
had his raz<>r with him, and it came in
v â¢Â»â >â¢ handy, procuring an opening in
the crowd which had gathered. Mark
Hart, wh<> is "an arm of the law," was
sent out of the dead line hy an officer,
and R-isil Booth went In search of a
tonic.
Mnrie Toughey. who is supposed to
be not old enough to know, took the
hint and moved, but Clarence King, the
undertaker, remained behind to see if
there were any fatal accidents. That
was poartbty from a desire to see his
fellow members get out in safety. The
flames could then be seen, and Harold
Montrose concluded that it was "his
move." Jane Whitbeck knew her place,
but wouldn't keep it, and Josie de
Witt, who is supposed to have money
to burn but no matches, was glnd of it.
Then came the members of the "Dra
matic School" and a "cornucopia of
t^rpsichorean confections," all huddled
togetner, which made their part seem
exceedingly realistic. The sign on the
bills, "Just tell them that you saw us."
wan uttered .'md the cornucopia dis
appearr-d in search of a dry place.
Last but not least came J. Schwartz
with a drum in one hand and a trunk
on his back, closely followed by friends
and admirers. All members of the
troupe and many of the audience
agree that Oottlob's speech was a
masterpiece so far as the rapidity of
execution was concerned.
The tale in brief which is told in the
programmes was not altogether car
ried out, but some portions were very
truthful. The first said, "Some things
happen that lead one to believe that
more things are likely to occur." Now
people wonder what next. The sec
ond, "You are induced to remain to
see the fulfillment of your anticipations
in act 3," was not heeded, and in act 3
before the final curtain. "LÂ«Â»nve the
theater if you dare," was mocked at
by audience and performers alik.\
It is estimated that Friedlander,
Oottlob & Co. will lose $XOOO through
the firr-. There was an insurance of
$2000 on some small articles of furni
ture, which were destroyed. All those
who had seats for last evening's per
formance will be able to prorurÂ» the
money paid out by calling at the Cali
fornia Theater Saturday evening.
Harry Oppenheimer. an advertising
man, helped materially in removing
the bric-a-brac from the theater, and
it was principally through his efforts
that all the fine ware was saved. The
stage hands removed every particle
of the scenery to the lpne in rear of
tho theater, but in the hurry of re
moving it some of It got destroyed.
COMITY AMONG
POLICE JUDGES
Meeting Has 'Been Called
to Adopt a Code of
Rules.
Presiding Judge Campbell De
sires Certain Evils Discussed
and Remedied.
One of the Most Important Will Be
the Acceptance of Bunds in
Appeal Cases.
Judge Campboll, as presiding judge
of the police courts, has called a meet
ing for to-morrow afternoon at which
the prosecuting attorneys of the four
courts will be asked to be present.
The object of the meeting is to agree
upon a code of rules of procedure, such
as is in existence in the Superior
courts. Hitherto from Jealousy, indif
ference or some other cause, there has
always been a lack of harmony among
the police Judges and it is thought the
time has arrived when an end should
be put to such an unsatisfactory state
of affairs. Hence the meeting to-mor
row afternoon.
The recent trouble between Judges
Low and Campbell over the Sidney
Kellett bond, which was taken into the
Supreme Court, has had much to do
with the calling of the meeting. One
of the rules will be that no appeal bond
shall be accepted except by the com
mitting Judge, and it is possible that
the rule will go even further and in
clude bonds for the release of prisoners
held to answer before the Superior
courts and bonds to be accepted for
the release of prisoners arrested on
warrants issued from a particular
court. At least this will be suggested,
and if adopted will remedy a cause for
many annoyances.
In support of the ruie it is pointed
out that the Judge holding a prisoner
or issuing a warrant of arrest is fa
miliar with the facts and cannot be,
therefore, imposed upon by false rep
resentations, as has been too often the
case.
Another suggestion, and a very
proper one, is that one judge with his
warrant clerk shall bÂ» on duty every
afternoon, Sundays excepted, for issu
ing warrants and attending to other
matters that may crop up. The courts
are often closed for the day by noon,
and people anxious to get a warrant
are compelled to wait till the next day,
which has often entailed considerable
annoyance and the escape of the per
son sought to be arrested. Judge
Joachimsen has for some months re
mained in his chambers every fourth
week till 4 o'clock in the afternoon
along with Assistant Prosecuting At
torney Drury for this purpose, and it
has proved beneficial in many ways.
Jud^e Conlan did not attend the
meeting Wednesday when Judge
Campbell was appointed presiding
Judge, as there was a difference of
opinion between him and Judge Camp
bell over the appointment of a French
interpreter to the courts, but it is
thought that will not keep him from
attending the meeting to-morrow in
view of the Important matters to be
discussed.
BODY WAS NOT DISSECTED.
J. B. Wilson Bequeaths r|is Body
to a Physician and Then
Outlives rjin).
The last will of J. B. Wilson was
filed for probate yesterday, but it is
certain that one of the grewsome
wishes of the testator will not be ful
filled. The will was written and signed
by the decedent many years ago. In it
he bequeathed his body to Dr. Weldon,
who resided in life at 2352 Mission
street, for dissecting purposes, but re
quested that his boners bo cremated af
ter the scalpel had stripped thenj of
flesh. Four years ago, however, the
physician to whom Wilson bequeathed
his body died. In consequence the tes
tator's remains were Interred without
being disiigured.
In the following paragraph of the
will Wilson gives his son, James Rae
Wilson, $100, and his granddaughter
$300. The balance of the decedent's es
tate is bequeathed George H. Wilson,
his eldest son.

EXPLANATION.
The arrow files with the wind. The top fig
ures at station Indicate maximum temperature
for the days; those underneath it, if any, the
amount if rainfall, of melted snow in inches
and hunciredths during the past twelve hours.
Isobars, or solid lines, connect points of equal
air pref surf, isotherms, or dotted lines, equal
temperature. The wind "high" means high
barometic pressure and is usually accompanied
with fair v.eather; "low" refers to low pres-
Fure and Is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear c:i the Washington coast. When
the pressure ts hiph in the interior and low
along the coast, and the isobars extend north
and south alms the coast, rain is probable:
but when the â¢â¢) ,w" is inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is im
probable. With a "hieh" in the vicinity of
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Cali
fornia coast, warmer weather may be expected
iri summer and colder weather in winter. The
reverse of these conditions will produce an
opposite result.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. Tan. 6.-To-day B stork market
was broad, animated and strong throughout
and gains were maintained with only lnslgnlfll
cant reactions at a few intervals. The buying
was on a very large sr-ale and was aggressive
end confident. A number of operators were In
the movement and the combined takings made
up a large share of the total transactions of
tne day. But there was manifest an outside
Interest in the market which was awakened by
yesterday's strength and the commission house
business on a fairly large- gcale. The Invest
ment demand for safe dividend payment stocks
and the heavy buying of bunds were also evi
tenoefl of an Infusion of new life into the mar
ket. It is likely that these df-alings were due
to the larg-e amounts made available for In
vestment by the January dividend and interest
disbursements--. Most of the dealings were pro
fessional, nevertheless, and they seemed to
have been Incited by the very confident expres
sions of one of tliÂ« largest and most dashing
operators in the market, who was in large part
thp IÂ«>adPr of last summer's rise.
Some, of the most notable gains were achieved
early In the day and werÂ» quite firmly held
throughout, even in the face of very laree
transactions. There was suggestion of realiz
ing in this, but all offerings were well ab
sorbed. The closing was only slightly below
the best and showed net gains of between 1
and 2 points for nearly all active stocks. Prices
for American securities were good in London
and In sÃUrope to-day and gave an Impetus to
the rise at the opening here, the International
FU.cks being the first to advance. Continued
(strength in Sugar also helped to sustain the
market.
The prevailing tightnpss of money showed the
first decisive tendency toward easing rates to
day, and while most loans were made at 34
per cent the rate yield. -d to I per cent and
closed at that. There was a bptter demand re
ported also for commercial paper, though not
sufficient to cause a yielding of the rate which
continued at 3'^ to 4 per cÂ»nt for choice grades.
There was some outstanding short interest In
the market, and the covering of this helped on
the rise.
The bond market was even more active and
stronger than stocks, and sortie notable gains
were scored. Total Bales, 15,099,000.
Government bonds were VÂ« higher all around.

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. Jan. 6.â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram: The stock
market? here were good to-day and fairly ac
tive, chiefly in the speculative departments,
where the features were the boom in Grand
Trunks and Canadian Pacifies.
Americans were also good and closed at the
best. There is more interest here, but little
business. Berlin, however. Is buying Canada
Pacifies and Americans freely. New York
Central rose sharply at the close on the publi
cation of the funding scheme.
A feature to-day was the great tightness
of money In India.
Reports Bay that the stringency was partly
artificially produced by the Presidency Banks
declining to lend, and so forcing up ex
change and making gold shipments probable.
Such Is not the case. The stringency Is real,
and a further rise In the bank rate is proba
ble. The Indian Council sold to-day twenty
lakhs of rupees In telegraphic transfers at
rates ranging up to I6d.
I am told privately that half a million in
gold may go from the Bank of England to
Argentina. This will steady money rates
here. â¢ -v
To-day's gold exports have caused a firmer
tone on the local money market, which has
prevented discount houses from lowering de
posit rates.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKETS.
CHICAGO, Jan. 6.â News affecting wheat be
fore trading commenced was chiefly bearish
and that was clearly the effect It had upon
the speculators. May, which closed yesterday
at 90% c opened at from 90c down to 89\e. sold
very sparingly at 90Â®90Hc, and then slid off
quickly to 89>&c. For two hours the range of
the fluctuations were practically limited be
tween the extremes mentioned. The main
points of the early market Information was as
follows: Liverpool quoted a decline of l*4d to
start with, and the reason for it was in one
cablegram ascribed to liberal offerings of Ar
gentine wheat and In another to Thoman's re
port and export surplus of 100,000.000 still avail
able in this country. A private cablegram from
Paris said that the wheat was rapidly de
clining and the market was weak and de
pressed. The Price Current remarked of the
condition of winter wheat that it was gener
ally protected by snow. The only bullish fea
ture of the early news was the small Chicago
receipts, only 41 cars being received. The up
turn to the market was helped by liberal clear
ances from Atlantic ports, which In wheat and
flour amounted to , 660,000 bushels. New York
and Baltimore reported fresh business done
for export. Closing cables made Liverpool
latest prices from Id to 17Â£"11 7 Â£"l lower than those
of the previous day. Several local shorts
bought steadily for an hour, when the price
of May was between 89*1 and 90% c, and when
the general crowd, who were short, tried to
buy, they found the salable wheat had all been
absorbed. May closed 90%0 bid, or %c higher
than it did yesterday.
Corn was moderately active. May closed V4@
Vie higher.
Oats were firm throughout the session. May
closed %Â®>%c higher.
Provisions were weak all day, owing to
heavy receipts here and at Western points. At
the close May pork was 12c lower; May lard
T%C lower, and May ribs Ms lower.

THE BIBLE SO PLAIN.
A colored Mrs. Partington lives in
Georgia, says the Constitution, and
she talks interestingly. She is about
70 years old and makes a great
show of reading the Bible â though it
is well known she cannot read a line.
The other morning she was seated on
her front porch with a large family
Bible on her lap. Some one was pass
ing and saluted her.
"Good morning, Aunt Caroline."
"Mawnin', suh â mawnin'! It'B right
previous weather, suh."
"Yes, rather previous."
"De clouds hang so low, hit look like
dey 'bout ter have a collegiance wid
de airth."
"Yes, it does look so."
"Well, de Lawd'll take keer on us.
De Bible say he distempers the wind
ter de born lambs."
"Is that the Bible you're reading?"
"Oh, yes, suh."
"Why, it's upside down!"
"Look heah, mister!" said the old
woman indignantly, "don't you s'pose
I knowed it? What diffunce do it
make? De Bible is so plain you kin
read it any way."

THROUGH PIQUE
Secret of Miss Snyder's
Marriage to a
Stranger.
Made the Acquaintance of Her
Husband in Her Own
Home,
tn a Few â Weeks She Will Probably
Be Able to Use Her Maiden
Name.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Jan. 6.
.Tueh sympathy is felt for Mrs. L.U-
I Snyder-Marsh in her present
trouble over her secret marriage in
San Francisco a few months ago, the
Is of which romance were publish
ed exclusively in The Call this morning.
Ai the time of the ill advised wed
ding Miss Snyder had no idea of the
haracter of the man who proposed
to her. She was introduced to him at
her home under circumstances that
were supposed to be a guarantee of his
respectability. Marsh was a very
pleasant fellow, and as Miss Snyder
was rather impetuous and very un
sophisticated he had no difficulty in
making a very favorable impression
on the young girl. The family was not
aware that Marsh was paying persist
ent attention to Miss Snyder, when
they were surprised to learn that she
had met her lover in San Francisco
one day and he proposed marriage.
Miss Snyder was suffering from a fit
of pique at the time, because of some
other affair which had not developed
in a manner to please her. While in
this humor and without taking thought
of the seriousness of the step she was
taking she went with Marsh before
Judge Bahrs and was married. On the
afternoon of her wedding day she re
turned home and informed her mother
and some of her relatives of what she
had done, and the affair was kept a
profound secret until it became known
that she was seeking a divorce. Her
family now believes that Marsh mar
ried h^r hoping to obtain some financial
benefit from the alliance. As soon as
the young lady realized that she had
been deceived she at once declared that
she would hfÂ» divorced.
The readiness with which Marsh con
sented to part from his wife and allow
her to return home almost immediately
after the ceremony has convinced her
relatives that he well knew he was
taking advantage of an innocent girl.
avA that other motives than love dom
inated his action.
Enough has been learned of Marsh to
justify the granting of a divorce.'and
in a few weeks Mrs. Marsh will no
doubt have received legal permission
to pass again in society as Miss Lilian
Snyder.

AN ITALIAN MISSION.
Aq Episcopal Clergyman to be
Secured to WorK in the Latin
Quarter.
One of the most important projects
yet undertaken by the Episcopal
church since the coming of Bishop
Nichols to the diocese of California is
about. to be inaugurated at St. Peter's
Church, located at the comer of Stock
ton and Filbert streets, of which Rev.
M. I). Wilson is rector. The territory
surrounding the parish is being gradu
ally monopolized by the Italians, of
whom there are. it is estimated, from
I*ooo to 20,000, who are exceptionally
â¢thrifty and enterprising. While much
the larger proportion of these people
attends the church of St. Peter and St.
Paul, there are many who would at
tend Protestant services, provided they
were held in their own language. A
canvass among the Italians encourages
the attempt that is to be made to pro
cure from the East a priest of the
Â£-p.iscopal church who is a native of
HVX,^ who haÃ been successful in
establishing strong churches of his na
nhE I*Â£ New York and Philadel
phia. â¦â¦ St ' Peter ' 8 is to be the focus of
Infinu m ? 1 ' and funds are now being
sol cited , to pay the expenses of an
?fvL BC tÂ°v, Pal â¦ Priest for a year - so as to
â¢ si Zl the attempt a fair trial.
The Ladies' Auxiliary of the diocese
has given the project some considera
tion and have practically decided to
guarantee the salary required. The
church Itself finds it difficult to meet
the expense, owing to the constant re
movals which are taking place nmong
the old members, notwithstanding the
utmost efforts of the rector^and people.
The new Italian minister is expected
about May 1.
OLYMPIC CLUB DOINGS.
Kicks From Handball Players and
Practice for a Billiard
Tournament.
The directors of the Olympic Club
met last evening and it was expected
by the members that something would
be accomplished relative to near-future
entertainments.
Howard P. Taylor, the leader, did not
materialize at the session, and as a
consequence the directors were unable
to accomplish anything athletically
speaking.
The handball players have grown dis
\ gusted with the action of the com
mittee, which Insisted that the tourna
ment must be held In the club courts.
i The only court worthy of the name of
handball court is at the outdoor
' grounds of the club, and games must
j be played during the day when players
I are busily engaged attending to busi
ness of more importance.
The club courts are not regulation
courts, consequently tournaments or
! special match contests cannot be held
| in them.
If the club caters to the handball
: players, who, by the way, are many,
it must grant outside concessions and
matches or tournaments must neces
sarily be held in the professional courts
I or not at all.
A committee consisting of H. B. Huss
and J. P. Kelly was appointed to ar
range for a billiard tournament, which
j will be held in the clv.Â» in the early
I part of February. One hundred dollars
was allowed for the purchase of
prizes. ,
The following notice, which is of ln
terest to visitors, was posted yesterday.
it reads:
"Owing to the very considerable use
of the privileges of the club made by
persons holding courtesy cards, and
the consequent additional expense in
volved therein, a charge of $1.50 will
hereafter be made on Issuance of cards
to strangers involving the use of all
the privileges of the club for a period
of two weeks. Visitors' cards, entitling
the holder to the use of billiard, card
and reading rooms, shooting gallery,
shuffleboard room and bowling alley,
will be issued as heretofore.

NEW PRIMARY
LAW IN EFFECT
Attention Is Directed to Sev
eral Very Important
Provisions.
Chairman McLaughlln Is Anxious
That the Law Be Given a
Fair Test.
Major Frank McLaughlln, chairman
of the Republican State central com â¢
, mittee, has addressed a circular to the
Republican county committees through
1 out the Stcte â¢ailing' attention to the
; provisions of ecct'OE 5 of the new p- â¢n
ary election lav/, which went into effect
1 on January 1. The section referred to
provides that t'u-;ng the month L f Ja.n
uary of each ;ear in which a general
; election to be held, the election com
missioners of each county or city and
county shall select from the precinct
registers of the county the names of
not less than fifteen electors residing in
each election precinct; the selections to
be mad^ from each of the political par
ties then existing, in as nearly an equal
proportion as possible. The nairK-s so
selected are to be written on separate
pieces of paper and the papers so fold
ed that the names written on them can
neither be seen nor read. The names
from each separate precinct are to be
placed in envelopes and sealed and
marked so as to designate the precincts
from which they were selected. All of
the envelopes so marked are to be
placed in a securely locked and sealed
box and safely kept until twenty days
before the holding of any primary
election, when the election cojnmission
ere shall proceed to draw from each
I precinct the names of those who are to
serve as election officers.
Major McLaughlin urges upon the
several county committees to see that
none but trustworthy and reliable citi
zens are selected to serve on the elec
tion boards. The circular concludes:
Tho new law in its general features Is
a good one, and every effort should bÂ»
made by the Republican party to give it
a fair test. If tbere ar<- any defects in
the law they will be ascertained
by this trial; wo can profit by experi
ence and suggest necessary amendments
to tho next .Legislature.
A primary law is a necessity, and this
one gives every voter an opportunity to
express his choice for delpgatos to nomi
nating conventions, irrespective of
cliques or combinations.
Your active and cordial support, to the
end that this law shall be maintained
and enforced; is most urgently requested
Such a law will purify our politics and
i-ring- good and representative cttisens to
all our nominating conventions, which
must result In securing the very best
possible nominations for office, redound
ing to tho endit of our party and the
interest of good government.

corner of California and Dupont
streets.
Long -before he graduated from the
college at Baltimore young O'Connell
said that if he ever lived to be or
dained a priest of the Catholic church
his wish was to say his first mass at
the old church, where many happy
recollections of his younger days were
associated, and from where he had re
ceived the first Inspiration to his call
in*;. '*â  '.t-,W.::-
Father Wyman has consented to
gratify this wish and the young
priest will celebrate mass at the Paul
lst Church for the first time imme
diately after the ordination cere
monies are over at the cathedral.

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 7. 1898.
THE MYSTERY
INCREASING
Dow's Death Still Worry
ing the Physicians and
Detectives.
A Rather Peculiar Circumstance
Revealed at the
Autopsy.
Plain Indentation of a Pistol Point
Fovmd in tho Klght
Axilla.
The case of Dow still remains a mys
tery, but the physicians are as posi
tive that it was a murder as the de
tectives are that it was a ease of sui
cide. Another feature, possibly slight,
has just cropped up, and several inter
ested parties are Wondering why the
fact was not thought to l><> of sufficient
importance to be mentioned heretofore.
At the autopsy it was discovered- by
Dr. Gallagher that an impression of
the point of a pistol barn 1 was plainly
indented in the right armpit, and that
without doubt the impression was made
after death. It is claimed that the
indentation would not remain where
circulation was still going on, and
hence the mystery sum. undine that
particular point of the now peculiar
case.
There are#many theories afloat re
garding the pistol imprint. The ques
tion is, was it made befora the body
was taken to the morgue by an un
known party who may hare committed
murder, or was it done while the ex
periments were going on in the Coro
ner's office after th<- removal of the
remains to the morgue? However,
the impression was in the body at the
time of burial.
It has been stated that an indenta
tion of the kind could not have bi'fn
made unless the steel barrel of the
weapon had been placed directly
against the skin of the victim, but
some are of the opinion that if a mur
der has beon committed the impression
of the pirtol point was made *by the
criminal shortly after he had commit
ted the crime.
The detectives are etill working on
: the case, but so far are no nearer to a
solution of the death of Dow than they
were the night the body was discov
! ered. This may be accounted for by
I the fact that there was very little if
any clew upon which to work.
Mrs. Mary "Williams, whose name
was mentioned in connection with the
mysterious death of John Dow, visited
police headquarters last night and had
a lons conversation with Captain Boh
en. She indignantly denied the state
ment made by Mrs. Dazel that she had
i been in the habit of visiting Dow's
shooting gallery and demanding money
of him.
. In answer to Captain Bohen's ques
tions she said she had been acquainted
with Dow for some time. According to
her statement she last saw him on the
Monday preceding the day on which
his dead body was found in his shoot
ing gallery. She says she visited his
place of business Â«vid after a few min
utes' conversation with him she left.
She declared that Dow was eccentric
and a very "peculiar individual." She
denied that she ever received any
money from him and that she ever
asked him for any. She also said that
. she has been receiving monthly remit
tances from the East and that It was
not necessary for her to have asked
Dow for money.
Mrs. Williams was accompanied by
her 15 year old son, who also bore out
his mother's statement to the effect
that she had been getting money from
the East. Dow, she says, was "an ex
pert with a rifle and a revolver. She is
convinced that he committed suicide
Mrs. Williams lives at Sixth and Mis
sion streets, and is about 45 years of
age. â¢
DISTINGUISHED
DOGS ARE OUT
A Notable Coursing Stake to Be
Run at Ingle
side.
Tho Big Purses Bring Out Crack
Fliers at Delta
Hall.
The coursing stake to be run at In
gleside this week was made up and
drawn at Delta Hall last evening. Aa
waa expected, the Increased purse
brought out an exceptional entry.
There were dogs from Santa Clara,
from Port Costa, from Iferced, from
Sacramento, from Colorado and from
the local kennels.
It is the biggest stake of its class
ever run off on an inclosed field in
America. It marks the full lift
coursing as it obtains at present and
gives some slight indication of the
height to which it is rising.
Â« Â»f the candidates declared San
Francisco appears to have the best of
the contest for the stake. The C ; urtis
kenneis of Santa Clara failed to show
up with even a nomination. The local
kennels put forward the best that was
eligible to the claaa and there remain*
but one dangerous factorâ the Colo

J. P. FRENNA WINS.
Charge of Threats to Kill. Preferred
by J. F- Turner, Dismissed.
The charge of threats to kill preferred
by J. F. Turner, real estate agent,
against J. P. Frenna Was heard by
Judge Conlan yesterday morning.
Turner testified that on December 17
he met Frenna outside Judge Hunt's
court-room and Frenna said. "I'll kill
thut man befor* I get through with
him." When asked if he had not
threaten- tl to kill Frenna he answered,
"No. I would give a good deal to keep
him alive for reasons of my own."
Robert I.iddle, the gunsmith, was
called but he said he did not hear
Frenna say anything to Turner. It was
then admitted that m man named
Stivers who had been subpoenaed to
be present but was not In court, would
testify tlio same as Turner, and this
closed the prosecution.
I>r. P. Cool nnd Thomas H. Curtis
for thÂ»> defense testif.ed that they \Â»^re
with Frenna at thf* time, but they did
not hear any threatening language
used. Frenna denied making any
threat on tliÂ« day mentioned. He ad
mitted having struck Turner a long
time ago, but now he had no intention
of injuring him.
The judge said there were three wit
nesses against two and he would there
fore dismiss the case.
WILL TRANSPORT
GOLDEN TREASURE
Fine River Boats That Are Be
ing Built for Traffic on
the Yukon.
The Contrnets Were Secured by
the Willamette Iron
Works.
Major Jp.m<Â»B Lotan, th<Â» manager of
tbe Willamette Iron Works in Oregon,
left the Occidental, where he has been
staying for the last few days, for his
home.
Major L,ntan"s trip here was on busi
ness connected with contracts for two
BtÂ«rn wheel river steamers his firm is
to build for the Yukon River trade. The
contracts, which have been signed,
were let by John A. Magee Jr., the
leather merchant at 810 Clay street,
who is acting for a large company be
ing formed which embraces among its
members several local and Eastern
capitalists, with plenty of money to
back th> in.
The contracts call for two stern
wheel steam river boats 175 feet in
length, of 36 feet beam and with a 7
f'.'.t dÂ»>pth of hold. They will hav> ls
im h cylinders, a 7-fo Â»1 Btrokfl ;ind will
I"- capable of maintaining a spet-l of
about eipht at nlno knots an hour.
Th<>ir freight carrying capacity will be
a little <>vÂ» r 400 tons, and they will
draw a little less than three feet and a
half of water.
These vessels are to be fitted up with
every appliance which will help to
make passenger travel in that region
comfortable, as th. y are expected to
carry from WO to Bg j ass. -tigers each.
Their cost wh.-n Jlnished will be
about ?i"0,Â«X)0 each Though work on
these vessels will be commenced at
once and pushed with all possible
speed, it is not expected they will be
completed much before the middle of
next May.
Major Lntan 1? taking a great deal
of pains in their construction, he has
made an extensive study of the pecu
liar requirements needed for the navi
gation of the Yukon, and Intends, if
possible, to make th.> results of his
first contracts the finest pieces of float
ing stock on the river.

shipful Master W. R. Jost, assisted by
the officers of the lodge.
There were present a large delegation

who filled the large hall. At the head
of the ranket that contained the mortal
remains of the <--ne the services were
being held over, were a number of
v>ry line flor;il emblems, two very
large pieces contributed, one by the
Hoard of Directors and the other by

ies were first permitted to take a final
view of the face of him that in life
had been their friend; then the Odd
Fellows passed around the bier; then
the Grand Army men, and last the
members of Oriental Lodge, who. after

Charles S. Desky, owner of the Cy

to the islands on the steamer Moana.
leaving to-morrnw night. Another big
three weeks' bicycle meet will ba in
augurated there, commencing Janu-
I ary 26, and Mr. Desky Invites any
| riders who think they are fast enough
and want to make some money to go
down. The prizes are good, ani there
will be plenty of racing. Mr! Desky
has invested $10,000 in thÂ« proposition.
but says the game has drawn im
mense crowdÃ and he is getting It back
fast. He Is much pleased with the out
look. He is stopping at the Occidental
and would be glad to met any Cali
fornia riders who would like to take a
pilgrimage to the Islands this spring:.
"We treat the boys well down there,"
he said to The Call man. "Why, of the
five who went down with me three
months ago only two have come !>aok.
The othersâ ('nnkling. Whitman and
Jones â like the country so well and are
making so much money they are go
ing to stay there."
This Is all quite true. The Califor
niar.s who went there say that Mr
Desky did even more than promised
for them, which was a good deal. They
are enthusiastic about the track, num
ber and value of prizes and everything
pertaining to the racing game.
Const cycling circles will soon lose
a shining star, and the Olympic Club
Wheelmen a popular and prominent
member. George H. Stratton Is to
leave here on the 17th inst. for Chica
go, and will make his home there, his
business interests hereafter lying in
that metropolis. The Olympics will
miss him a great deal, and the sport
itself Is likely to suffer for want of his
guidincr hand, always so prominent in
the honest direction of its interests. If
he takes up with his favorite pastime
in the windy city Chicago cycling
ranks will gain a valuable man.
The Cycle Board of Trade will hold
Its first annual banquet and . moker
to-morrow evening at 112 Pine street,
at 7 o'clock. The board has a plethoric
treasury, and this means was taken of
partially disbursing it and at the same
time bringing the members together in
social intercourse.
The Bay City Wheelmen's ball team
will cross bats with the nine of the
Olympic Cyclers in a practice game
next Sundey, at 12 o'clock, at the Velo

An important meeting of the C. A. C.
C. officers and roramitteempn will be
held to-night at room 137. Phelan
building. To-morrow night the board
of governors will meet at the Encinal
Club. Alameda, taking the 7:30 narrow
gauge boat from this side.
Kd C. Christ is on a business trip
through Southern California and Ari
zona for the Steams people.
James W. Coffroth of the Olym

quick Eastern trip, and was well en
tertained during his short stay.
AN OPERATIC PRODUCTION.
The ThaMci German Hebrew Com
pany at the Bush-Street
Theater.
The Thalia German-Hebrew Opera
Company will produce the operetta
"Alexander, Crown Prince of Jerusa
lem." at the Bush-street Theater to
night and Sunday night. The operetta
Is based on a love story supposed to
have happened during the time of King
Hurdus. Alexander, the Crown Prince
of Jerusalem, falls in love with Naomi,
a peasant ftirl, and after several meet
ings they pledge their troth. Alexan
der gives his betrothed a ring which
she is to surrender to him three months
from the time he would became King.
Arlstablus, an eider brother of Alex
ander, dies suddenly, and Alexander
hastens to Jerusalem to assume the
throne. His mother, learning of his
love for Noami, has the ring stolen
from her while she is on her way to the
palace to- claim Alexander for her hus
band. When they meet, Alexander be
comes angry when Nnaml is unable to
produce or account for the loss of the
ring, and she faints. Orief over the
loss of her betrothed nearly causes her
death. Pome time later, Alexander
learns that N'oarni Is the child of his
elder brother and that she had been
stolen while an infant and adopted by
the peasant. After the usual explana
tions, Alexander marries his sweet
heart.

Owners.
ittalnment Claimed From a Race.
Three Favorites Captured Purses.
Song and Dance In Front.
The selling rare war Inaugurated
some days ago at Ingleside Is proving
a most pro-lific source of income to the
Pacific Coast Jockey Club. When
George Lee took the opening event in
clever fashion yesterday, "Plunger"
McManus got back at Sam Hildreth
for bidding up St. Cuthbert at the re
cent Oakland meeting by bidding the
winner up from $200 to $SOO. at which
figure Sam let the colt go. Attain
ment, a starter in the same race, en
tered to be suld far $400, was claimed
by Tintmona & Marks, which firm
started La Loma. The next "lift" oc
curred in the fourth race. Double
Quick, the winner, was entered to be
sold for $500, and when Frank Brown
bid him up to $1000. Atkins & Lott
ridge parted company with the chest
nut horse. By the smile that illumin
ated his countenance. By Holly evident
ly thought he unloaded a gold brick in
the last event, the extra six-furlong
run. Torsion, the fortunate winner, had
$300 opposite his name on the card, and
when Sam Hildreth said $500. By smil
ingly bid adieu to the big Torsion
horse and hereafter he will carry the
Hildreth colors. From this little batch
of "boosts" the Jockey Club profited
to the extent of $650. and the manage
ment smiles as the merry war rages
in all its fierceness.
The downpour of rain and the sloppy
going did not seriously interfere with
the success of the favorites, for four
out of six were successful. This does
not mean that by the downfall of the
other three the books profited to any
great extent, for all of them were fair
ly well backed.
No doubt the most serious setback
the talent received was over the result
of the two-mile run, a sweepstake at
$25 each, with $1000 added by the asso
ciation. The weights looked all in fa
vor of The Bachelor and he went to
the post a warm 6 to 5 favorite. The
slushy going, though, was not to his
liking and Song and Dance, the pace
maker, won in a big canter. The win
ner, carrying 112 pounds and Spencer
in the saddle, drifted back in the bet
ting from 5 to 2 to 16 to 5. Vinctor.
the second choice, was a dismal third.
George Lee looked the best of the
eleven starters in the opening seven
furlong run, ajjd finishing strong the
last part won handily from Attain
ment, the second choice, ridden by
Thorpe. The latter filly made all the
running. Barney Schreiber took third
money with Dr. Marks.
The smart filly Tea Rose looked a
"moral" for the five-furlong dash, but
after opening in the betting at even
money went back to 13 to 10. while
Count of Flanders was hammered
down from 8 to 5 to 11 to 10. Tea Rose
led from the first jump and won, pull
ing Clawson out of the saddle, from
the Count.
Double Quick, the 13 to 20 choice for
the fourth event at seven furlongs, was
given quite a forcible argument by
Harry Thoburn, but shook that geld
ing off in the stretch and won at the
wire by a couple of lengths. Thorpe,
on the latter, urged him so hard the
first part in a fruitless endeavor to beat
the winner that, staggering at the end.
he was beaten a "nose for the place by
Walter J.
Fog rolling in from the ocean ob
scured much of a view of the mile and
a sixteenth selling affair, for which the
Baldwin entry Argentina went to the
post a7to 5 chance. At any rate Eddie
Jones could not land her a winner.
Plan, the second choice, jumped out in
the lead and never headed led the first
choice over the line by three lengths.
Can't Dance was a close third, a block
In front of Cromwell.
The last event was declared off and
a cheap six furlong scramble substi
tuted. Ten started, with Sorrow carry

HYPNOTIZED BY
HEAVING WATER
So Says Miss Ray Frank of
the Many Ferry Sui
cides.
Despondenoy, Business Failure and
Unrequited Love Not the Cause
of Self- Destruction.
Miss Ray Prank gave forth the the
ory yesterday at her lecture at Mrs.
Sloss' residence that It Is not despon
dency, business failure, unrequited
love and the like that leads to bo many
suicides from the ferry-boats passing
Goat Island. She says the unfortu
nates who thus cast away their lives
are hypnotized by the moving water.
She states that it is dangerous to
look upon the moving water, for the
motion is in opposition to th,Â» motion
of the person, and therefore the person
is so powerfully affected as to make
him throw himself Into the bay.
On the other hand, she states that if
the water had the same motion as the
person no opposition would arise and
consequently it would have no lnrlu*
ence.
Not of all the people that end their
lives in this manner dees Miss Frank
speak, but it is her theory that this is
the case with the majority.
During her lecture she recalled the
old legend that God when he made
man endowed him with every blesnlng
and gift that he himself had, and when
it came to the last he decided to hold
back one gift lest man would not need
him. This gift was rest. Seeking for
this Is the object of the whole world;'
it is the problem that makes men
brothers; that has touched the human
world more than any other.
Jo, the Divorce Courts.
George Green was granted a divorce
from Olivia Green yesterday on the
ground of desertion. John A. Martin
was granted a divorce from his wife,
Catherine E. Martin, on the ground of
willful desertion.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, FRIDAY, JAXLTARY 7, 1898.
THE VERDICT
IS TOO SEVERE
So Say the Attorneys of
Dick Phelan, the Sierra
County Murderer.
The Supreme Court Will Be
Asked to Set Aside the
Judgment.
A Much Talked of Case That Will
Probably Be a Long
One.
Another appeal from the Judgment
rendered in a recent murder trial is
being perfected and will soon be pre
sented to the Supreme Court.
On October 19 Richard Phelan, the
superintendent of the Gold Ridge
Mine, a claim owned by the Marguer
ite Mining Company in Sierra County,
shot and killed Daniel O'Connor, a
miner and prospector of that section
of the country.
The shooting was the outcome of a
similar affair of a year ago in which
O'Connor's brother, James, was hit in
the hip by a builet fired at Phelan by
a man named Paul Muller, who was
himself shot and instantly killed by
Phelan. Phelan was acquitted of the
murder of Muller, as it was shown at
the trial that Muller and O'Connor had
been sent up by some of the other
stockholders In the concern to jump
Phelan's portion of the claim and
thereby freeze him out, Phelan's affi
davit of assessment work being held
back to afford an excuse for the ac
tion; also that when the fracas oc
curred Phelan acted entirely on the
defensive, not shooting until Muller
had shot at him and wounded O'Con
nor In his endeavor to kill.
After recovering from his wound
O'Connor left that part of the coun
try, but his brother, Dan, remained,
continuing In the employ of Phelan,
though he made, almost daily, threats
against the life of his boss because
of the injuries suffered by his brother
James.
Finally Dan O'Connor became so
troublesome that Phelan was obliged
to discharge him. After receiving no
tice of his discharge he went to work
on a claim of his own, situated some
four miles from Phelan's mine. He
and his partner were entirely without
funds, and had it not been for the
fact that Phelan continually sent them
supplies and provisions, agreeing to
wait for his money until such time
as they could pay it, they would have
been forced to abandon their enter
prise. Notwithstanding these acts of
friendship on Phelan's part, O'Connor
continued his threatening language.
O'Connor was addicted to the use of
Intoxicants, and when in town usually
got drunk. On the day of the killing
Phelan and O'Connor met in Sierra
City, and after some short conversa
tion separated, Phelan returning to
his mine, which is located some two
miles out of the city. While working
on the trail leading to that place he
encountered O'Connor, who was re
turning from the town. Without a
word of warning O'Connor opened
fire on Phelan, discharging his revol
ver twice, but failing to hit his In
tended victim. Before he could shoot
a third time Phelan returned the fire
with a rifie, shooting once, the bullet
striking O'Connor on the side of the
neck and killing him instantly. Phe
lan's rifle was one which belonged In
his camp, but which he had taken
from there In order to prevent It from
getting into the hands of an intoxi
cated employe.
Messrs. Edward J. Banning and
Barclay Henley, who are associated
with Hon. F. D. Soward as attorneys
for the defendant, claim that the ver
dict of murder in the second degree,
brought in by the Jury which tried the
defendant at Downievllle, was not a
just one nor one In accordance with
the testimony; as the very worst
which could possibly be expected from
the evidence, granting that the theory
of the prosecution was correct, would
bo a verdict of manslaughter. They
further claim the community was so
antagonized by the misrepresentations
of the two newspapers there â the Mes
senger, in which Fred Wehe, the Dis
trict Attorney, Is financially Inter
ested, and the Enterprise, whose edi
tor. John B. Irish, was associated with
Wetee in the prosecution, that it was
impossible for their client to obtain
an impartial trial.
Phelan was sentenced to serve
twenty-five years in Folsom.
WILL VISIT HIS
FORMER HOME
The Rev. Dr. Bolton Granted an
Indefinite Leave of
Absence.
Ho Is Now Convalescing After a
Very Severe Attack of
Neuralgia.
The Rev. W. W. Bolton, rector of
the Church of St. Mary the Virgin, on
the corner of Union and Steiner
streets, will leave for Victoria, B. C,
on Tuesday next to be absent for sev
eral weeks, if not months. Dr. Bolton,
who was the first rector of the church,
has been ill for some time past, and
his physicians recommended a change
of climate and scene. He came here
from Victoria eight years ago, and he
believes that a trip to his old home
will restore him to health.
"I am subject to neuralgia," Bald
Dr. Bolton last night, "and I am now
recovering from a particularly severe
attack. My physicians Informed me
that absolute rest and a change of cli
mate were necessary to completely
restore me to health. When the vestry
of the church heard of the opinion of
the physicians they kindly granted me
a leave of absence. I have permis
sion to remain away until I feel that
I can again take up my pastoral
work. I hope that a month's rest will
be sufficient, but it may take longer.
My family 'will remain in the city
during my absence."
The vestry has not yet decided who
will take charge of the church during
the absence of Dr. Bolton. The Rev.
E. Van Deerlin of Grass Valley wili
relieve Dr. Bolton after next Sunday.
He will probably remain here about
two weeks, and in the meantime some
of the clergymen will be selected to
occupy the pulpit until Dr. Bolton re
turns.

WILL MEET TO
FILL VACANCIES
A Special Session of the
Police Board Is
Called.
Speculation as to Who Will Be
Made a Sergeant and a
Detective.
The Wife o f a Member of the Force
Will Ask That Her Husband
Be Disciplined.
The fact leaked out yesterday that
the Police Commissioners will hold a
special meeting to-morrow night,
which caused a good deal of comment.
One of the objects of the meeting will
be to fill the vacancy caused by the re
tirement of Sergeant Fitzgerald. The
promotions of Corporal Ayers and Po
liceman Owen Gorman to fill the va
cancies due to the retirement of Ser
geants Cornelius Martin and Abe
Houghtallng were expected and have
given general satisfaction throughout
the department, but it was confidently
anticipated that the other vacancy
would have been filled at the same
time.
It has developed that the reason was
owing to the Commissioners being un
able to agree upon the lucky one.
There are quite a number of men seek
ing promotion who by their meritori
ous work and years of service are just
ly entitled to recognition, and their
claims are being vigorously presented
by their friends. The difficulty of
selecting one out of the number agree
able to the three Commissioners could
not be surmounted Wednesday night
and consequently it was decided to
meet again to-morrow night. In the
meantime an effort will be made to ar
rive at an amicable understanding, so
the appointment can then be made.
It is also understood that at the
meeting the vacancy in the detective
department will be filled. It has been
in existence since last April when Ben
Bohen was promoted to be captain of
detectives, and no apparent reason has
ever been advanced for keeping it
open so long. Two names have been
prominently mentioned several times
for the positionâ Ed Wren and Harry
Reynolds. Both have been doing de
tective work for some time and are
eminently qualified to fill the bill. Wren
has been associated with Detective Ed
Gibson, and together they have made
several Important arrests, the latest
being the Japanese murderer, George
Tauchi.
A case will also be heard by the Com
missioners of a delicate nature. The
wife of a member of the force has pre
ferred a charpe apainst her husband
of being unfaithful to his marriage
vows, and she wants the Commission
ers to discipline him and compel him
to behave himself like an officer and
a gentleman.

BULLETIN'S
GUILT IS
CONFESSED
Crothers to Avoid Fur
ther Shame Will
Compromise.
Another Meeting of Vic
timized Merchants Will
Be Held To-Day.
Additional Proof of Duplicity
and Swindling Ready for
Production.
A CAMPAIGN INCIDENT.
An Attempt Was Mntte to Hold Up
the Chairmtin oT the Re-publican
State Comrn'.ttee.
The proprietor of the Bulletin and
his advisers will pet a fair hearing at
the meeting of the victimized mer
chants to-day. The men who have been
robbed are not desirous of convicting
any one unjustly, but they will demand
in no uncertain manner a confession
from Crothers and his advisers of all
the facts. When the truth â the whole
truth â is submitted Judgment can then
be passed as to the degree of guilt.
If it can be shown that Crothers and
his advisers were simply the tools of a
trio of professional schemers in the
advertising line the verdict may be
tempered with mercy. Any attempt on
the part of the Bulletin crowd to dodge
the real issue by insolent tactics of
bulldozing and ungentle allusions to
the victims as kickers, such as the col
umns of the Bulletin last evening
might imply, wiil be met by firm de
termination to punish the offenders for
contempt as well as to inflict upon
them the brand of shame.
It may not have dawned on what it
seems funny to call the minds of the
Bulletin that the paper is no longer
feared or respected oven by the most
timid of citizens. Every one outside of
the old concern knows that its glory
has goneâ that its prestige ha& depart
ed. Small boast is uitered that its
publication ia profitable, which boast
might be made by a. veritable bunko
steerer who had escaped the vigilance
of the police.
No one about the old paper seems to
have the Intellect or conscience to
comprehend that the injury to a jour
nal which follows the loss of character
and honor involves a greater loss than
can be measured by dollars and cents.
There was a period in the history of
the Bulletin when a half million dol
lars placed for its conductors on the
side of infamy and honor could not
as much us tempt tnem to swerve
from the path <>t journalistic honor.
But these men of heroic integrity are
not managing ihe Bulletin to-day.
Their example has been lost on Cro
thers and the weaklings who surround
him. His paper has been going from
bad to worse since the day that he
bought it. The stupidity of the busi
ness department is matched by the
asininity of the editorial bureau. The
news department occasionally awak
ens the world of feminine fashion with
a page descriptive of foreign lingerie,
and meanwhile the poor old adminis
trator of the Pickering estate goes
along, oblivious to the march of events
In journalism, deluding himself with
the notion that he is publishing a
True enough, the head of the busi
ness department daily tells him that
it is not a newspaper from a news
point of view, and the head of the
news department tells him that it is
not a newspaper from a business point
of view, and while Crothers hesitates
to believe either the public readily be
lieves both.
On the quiet Crothers Is passing
along the word that he is the chief vic
tim, and therefore the merchants
should r.ot deal harshly with the Bul
letin. The business manager Is trying
to square things with soft soap, but
the manipulator of the fashion page
wants Crothers t<> get cat and light
all the merchants who protest against
being robbed. Bo the Bulletin as It
appears Is not the Bulletin as It exists.
yvfmx attitude that precious legal light
.-of the Institution will take may not be
disclosed until the meeting to-day.
â While he is waiting ;ind declaring that
no compromise can be made, the busi
ness manager is confidentially com
promising. Crothers is already so
lamentably compromised that he is
â¢willing to throw up the sponge and
make restitution. The chances are that
the Bulletin crowd will go to the meet
ing with big threats and bold bluffs.
The merchants who have the right on
their side and the obligation to protect
themselves and the community in gen
eral from swindlers ami blackmailers
should not yield an iotji The Call has
cut the claws of Crothers' old newspa
per cat and no one need fear its
scratch.
Proof of the Bulletin's guilt is cumu
lative and overwhelming. Scores of
reputable merchants of the highest
standing come forward voluntarily
and describe In detail how the swind
ling dodge was worked on them. Old
friends and advertising patrons of the
paper tell Orothers frankly that so
many business mpn would not |e a g Ue
themselves against his paper without
Just cause, but he is so completely un
der the domination of weak and inex
perienced advisers that he hesitates to
confess and ask forgiveness. He has
been told that the way to win is to
brazen it out.
The animn! that brays loudest on
the Pickering pasture tells him that
commerce breeds cowardsâ that men
who sell merchandise for a living have
not the courage to fight and will con
sequently fall down and whimper if
the Bulletin preserves bold effrontery.
The merchants of the city who have
been robbed have a duty to perform
which they cannot afford to shirk. The
least sign of weakening on their part
will encourage the boodlers to assail
them with extra venom. They should
therefore assemble with a firm, and
fixed purpose to obtain instant restitu
tion. Insolence, if tolerated for a mo
ment, will breed more insolence. It af
fords The Call no pleasure to advertise
the Bulletin's shame, but Journalism
has its duties and obligations which
must be performed. In the present
performance there is a tinge of regret
in the reflection that a paper like the
Bulletin, which once stood so high In
the confidence of the commercial com
munity of San Francisco, should have
descended to its present degree of deg
radation and in Its decline boast that
the publication of the paper was a
source of profit to its conductor.
Some weeks since Colonel J. P. Jack
pon, Collector of the Pprt, was furi
ously assailed in the columns of the
Bulletin. The violence of the assault
caused some surprise in the limited
circle reached by the paper, but no one
was able to explain the cause of the sud
den tirade, until Colonel Jackson saw tit
to enlighten the public mind by a state
â  ment that he had declined to give the
paper an advertisement of Napa soda
water, which it,s proprietor very much
i desired.
Yesterday Colonel Jackson was asked
; to give the details leading up to the
assault, but declined to do so on the
ground that the incident had passed.
"I do not care to revive the matter
i now,"' said the colonel, "as the oppor
; tunity has passed. At the time of the
1 attack on me I gave The Call a full
: account of the transactions and every
thing that occurred between Crothers
mid myself, but for some reason The
Can sent me word that it did not de
sire to jump on the Bulletin. I do not
care to bring up the subject afain."
"The incident passed between
; Crothers and myself. It was about an
advertisement. Crothers simply tried
! to hold me up in Dick Turpin fashion
and I would not submit to his demand.
It was straight between myself and
Crothers. There was no go-between
and no one assuming to represent the
proprietor of the Bulletin. Crothers
i himself made the demand, and on my
refusal to accept his ultimatum his
j par ...eked me. Ido not withhold
!fr ... you the detailed information
L.iiougb any lack of friendship for The
â¢ Call, but because your paper declined
to take up the matter at the time that
I v ;mted the public to know the mo
tives that caused the Bulletin to at
tack me. I have made no terms or
compromise with the Bulletin and do
not propose to yield or compromise."
F. \V. Dohrmann, of the firm of
Nathan, Dohrmann & Co., was seen
at his place of business yesterday.
When asked if another meeting of mer
chants would be called to consider the
Bulletin's hold-up, he said that a meet
ing had been called to convene Fri
day at 10:30 a. m.
A merchant of the highest standing,
who Is numbered among those victim
ized, said yesterday, in discussing the
topic: "I do not want you to quote my
name pending the settlement of my
account, but I tell you there is ore
honorable course open to Mr. Croth
ers, and that is to come into that meet
ing to-morrow, acknowledge that the
merchants were deceived and swindled
by parties claiming to speak for the
paper, and then leave the matter of
payment, the amount I mean, to the
sense of fairness possessed by the in
dividual merchant. Restitution should
be made of money paid under threat
of law suits. That is the only honor
able course open to the paper. Now
this is confidential. I understand from
the Bulletin people themselves that
they were bunkoed by Eastern adver
tising agents."
Stories descriptive of the Bulletin
methods during the last political cam
paign are coming to light. It is not a
new thing, it seems, for that journal
to engage in a hold-up when money
is needed to run the concern. The pos
itive proof can be produced that the
manager of the paper sought to hold
up Frank McLaughlin. chairman of
the Republican State Committee, at a
time when the members of the com
mittee were engaged in vigorous effort
to provide means for paying the legit
imate expenses of the campaign.
The Bulletin made a straight de
mand for money, and the committee
squarely refused to pay the sum named
or any sum. As a result of the re
fusal the Bulletin turned about and
abused the committee and found fault
with the management of the cam
paign. These facts are well known to
Frank McLaughlin and other members
of the State Committee. As the search
light is now turned on the Bulletin,
other transactions equally odious may
be revealed to the public gaze.
SWINDLED BY BULLETIN.
S. B. Leavltt. senior partner in the
paper firm of S. B. Leavitt & Co., of
509 Sacramento street, had a similar
experience to so many of the other
patrons of the Bulletin's special edi
tion. In response to a request for a
statement of his experience, Mr. Lea
vitt said:
"Yes, we were swindled by the Bul
letin. A representative of that paper
came to us and kept hounding us for
a week for a write-up. He told us that
it would cost us nothing, as the Bulle
tin was engaged In writing up the
commercial progress of the city and
desired to include all the well-estab
lished houses. We told the young man
that we had nothing to advertise; that
our business was all with the printing
trade and needed no advertising. The
young man returned several times, and
we made the same reply. Finally he
came in and said that they proposed
to give a cut of the building and want
ed a few data as to the history of the
house.
"As they insisted that it would cost us
nothing we finally consented and told
him to write It up himself. This he
did, and a proof of the matter was re
ceived by us with a request that it be
returned. We paid no attention to this
and next received a letter similar to
that published in yesterday's Call ask
ing why we did not send back the
proof. We paid no attention to this
either. Then another letter came
asking for a return of the proof, and
thereupon it was sent back by us. Then
another solicitor called and asked me
if we would not be willing to give a
little something to help the paper
along. I talked it over with the book
keeper and we decided we would give
$5 to help out. Then the solicitor asked
me to sign a paper stating that I was
willing to contribute something toward
the expense and for the first time In my
life I signed a document without read
ing it, supposing It was merely a prom
ise to contribute a small amount at my
own option. In a few days the article
appeared, and almost Immediately
came a collector, who . presented a bill
for $31. I was thunderstruck to think
that we should be called upon to pay
such a sum. Thereupon the collector
produced a contract signed by me by
which I agreed to pay $1 a line. I
read it and told the collector that It
was true I had signed the contract,
but it was under gross misrepresenta
tion, and that I would not pay it. I
told him that the solicitor had assured
me it would not cost anything further
than any small amount we might care
to contribute toward paying the ex
pense of the edition. The collector de
nied that they had represented it
would not cost anything, and said It
in such a way that I and the book
keeper both told him he was a liar and
ordered him out of the house. The
next we heard was that the account
was in the hands of a collector, where
It still remains. We certainly shall not
pay it I havo always had a great re
spect for the Bulletin people, and never
supposed that they would resort to
such methods. Why, they are worse
than highway robbers, for a highway
robber will give you a little chance to
protect yourself."
Merchants' Association Meeting.
The Call has recelTed a communi
cation from F. W. Dohrmann, in which
he says that the meeting called to con
sider the Bulletin's case was not called
officially by the Merchants' Association.
A fac simile of the call, signed by the
secretary of the association, was pub
lished in this paper day before yester
day. The call for the meeting ema
nated from the office of the Merchants'
Association. It was duly signed by the
secretary, and the record of the meet
ing was entered In the minutes of the
association. It would appear, there
fore, that Mr. Dohrmann has not been
correctly advised as to the facts in the
premises. __ ___________^__

THE LUCKY LOUISE.
Rich Developments in a Madera
County Mine Owned by Wood
land People.
The Lucky Louise mine, In Madera
County, owned by the Shaw brothers
and the Lauguenour family of Wood
land, is producing ore of great value.
Samples tested at Selby's indicated a
value of $800 to the ton. The mine was
discovered twenty years ago and only
slightly developed. Subsequently there
was a lucky find, but the treasure un
covered was thought to be only a
pocket. The Shaw brothers bought
the property for $10,000. Tunnels ex
tended on the 60 and 100 foot levels
disclosed a broadening of the ore vein
and richer rock than the surface vein
contained.
Gold to the value of $40,000 has al
ready been brought from the mine to
this city.
M. J. Shaw, one of the owners, was
in town yesterday. He contemplates
the purchase of a stamp mill to work
the large ore body recently discovered.
The work of crushing the rock is now
performed by arastras.

Also Criticized.

The Whole Matter Will Be Brought
Up by Director Head Next
Wednesday.
The story published exclusively in
yesterday's Call of the manner in
j which James McKnlght, a scholar of
j the John Swett Evening School, was
| beaten by the principal of the institu
tion after he had been handcuffed by
the Individual who holds the dual po
sition of Janitor and special policeman,
has caused intense indignation among
certain School Directors, and an in
vestigation is certain to be demanded
at the next meeting of the board.
The main demand for a thorough
overhauling of the school will be on
account of the McKnight case, several
Directors deeming that such methods
are not only prejudicial to the best in
terests of the department, but tending
to degrade the boys who are so pun
ished. The lack of discipline shown
at the school will also come in for an
investigation.
Director Head, who has always made
a stand against severe modes of pun
ishment and whose contention has al
ways been that the evening schools are
over well supplied with incompetent
teachers, will open the ball on Wednes
day evening next by requesting that in
future Janitors be required to attend
strictly to their duties for which they
are paid, that of cleaning class rooms,
lighting and extinguishing lights and
such other matters as are required of
them. He will demand that Janitors be
ordered not to assist teachers in pun
ishing pupils. "* %
Then he will go into the competency

of the teachers and try to ascertain
how and why they were appointed.
"If the reports that I have hÂ«ard of
the matter are correct," said Director
Head yesterday, "the whipping of the
boy McKnlght was nothing less than
an assault and an outrage that de
mands a full investigation. .
"I never heard that it was the duty
of Janitors to assist teachers in per
forming their duties, and I don't be
lieve that it was ever contemplated
that a burly, puffed-up Janitor should
handcuff a stripling of a boy in order
that he might be beaten to the satis
faction of the teacher or principal.
His denial that he ever put the cuffs
on a scholar, when this boy's story was
corroborated by Miss Mead, the prin
cipal, is evidence that he knew he was
doing wrong and that he feared the
consequences.
"Miss Mead had her proper recourse,
and that was to send the boy home if
he became too unruly to handle. I
think this case, as well as others I
have heard of, simply through rumors
that now appear to be worthy of fol
lowing up, seems to call for the fullest
overhauling and the passage of strict
rules that will stop all such methods
of cowing the rising generation of boys
that are to become our citizens. .
"What The Call reporter saw at the
school simply bears out what I have
always contended â that half of our
evening school-teachers are young
girls, who are not competent to handle
the classes that they are paid to teach.
The larger portion of the evening
school pupils are large boys, and, from
being at work, more or less Independ
ent. They should be looked after by a
man principal, who could handle and
punish them if absolutely necessary. I
shall bring this matter up also and try
to see whether it is possible to get bet
ter material into the department."
