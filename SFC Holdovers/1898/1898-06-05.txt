CALL OFFICE, RIGGS HOUSE,
WASHINGTON, JUNE 4. Â£
The brave deed of Constructor Hobson *!
and seven men of the Merrimac is the talk a
of Washington to-night. Naval officers de- S
clare that this feat will rank as one of the f,
most daring and brilliant episodes in naval Â«
.â¢history. s*
Admiral Sampson's cablegram '
rvn-iy .gave the name of Con
ftriictbr Hobson, but it is as
sumed that the others may have
been the regular crew of the
Merrimac.
As soon as the names are re
ceived, together with fuller de
tails. Congress will pass a resolu
tion of thanks and will authorize
medals to be struck by the Phil
w adelphia Mint in recognition of
thebravcry of each of the eight
men. It is understood that "Rep- ;
rcspntative Boutelle. chairman of
the. House Naval Affairs Com
mittee, will present the resolu
tion on Monday, if by that time
fuller details have been received
from an official source.
Admiral Sampson's brief cable
reports stated that the. flag of
truce was sent by Cervera in
recognition of the bravery of the
eight men. It is certain, then,
that although they are held as
prisoners of war, they are in no
danger. The request of Admiral
Sampson that they be exchanged
for the Spanish prisoners of war
at Atlanta, was, it is believed,
based on an understanding of this
kind between the truce parties.
In the absence of detailed in
formation it is impossible for ex
perts to form a correct idea of the
'efficacy of the blockade formed
i; by the Merrimac's wreck. They
Were this afternoon without defi
â \ nite information as to the where
abouts of the wreck. The hydro
graphic charts published by the
Navy Department show the nar
; r owest as well as shallowest point
to be between Estrella and Can
ones Points, where the navigable
. channel seems to be less than a
... sixteenth of a mil.c in width, while
". there are but five fathoms (thirty
fret) of water.
..If the land batteries have been
reduced by this time our war
. ships will be able to harass the
Spaniards should they attempt to
clear away the debris, but if. as
â  stated in press dispatches re
:.! ceived to-day, the forts have not

the wreck and clear the channel.

'â In this case, War Department
engineers say the work of clear
ing the channel will be almost im
: possible. At 'any rate it would
..consume several days, in the face
â¢Of the fire from our squadron. By
â  that time it is believed the forts
will have been demolished.

are under way indicates that the
entire expedition has either.

cleared or will sail within a few
hours, for it was understood that
they would go together. War
Department officials decline to
give any information or even to
hazard a guess as to the time of
their arrival at the point of de
barkation, but the general opin
ion is that the troops will be
landed some time on Wednesday
next, and it is expected by the
end of next week news will come
that our troops have taken the
town of Santiago.
Admiral Cervera is now be
yond a\\ hope. No naval battle
is expected now. for while the
Merrimac's wreck prevents the
egress of the Spanish vessels, it
will, of course, obstruct the en
trance of our own vessels.
Siege guns will batter Cer
vera's ships to pieces from the
high hills and he will not be able
to reply. Neither can he expect
any relief from other quarters, for

RICHMOND P. HOBSON, U. S. N.
President McKinley to-day re
ceived reliable information that
the so-called "reserve squadron"
of Spain was still anchored at
Cadiz. It could not possibly
cross in less than ten days. By
this time all will be over, and
operations will probably have
commenced at San Juan, Porto
Rico.
Assistant Secretary of War
Meiklejohn stated to-day that the
second expedition to the Philip

Wednesday.

CAPE HAYTIEN, June 4.â More particulars
were received here to-day about the sinking of
the collier Merrimac in addition to those I cabled
you last night. The Merrimac entered the harbor
of Santiago de Cuba early in the morning and was
sunk by her own crew. Naval Constructor Hob
son, who was in charge of her, exploded a tor
pedo and she went down almost instantly. The
eight men who were on her jumped on a raft and
were made prisoners.
Great admiration was expressed by the Span
ish officers at the daring deed. Admiral Cervera
communicated with the American squadron and
offered to exchange the prisoners, but the result
of the negotiations is not known here.
While the American fleet was bombarding the
fortifications the insurgents began to attack the
city from the rear, but, according to Spanish re
ports, were easily repulsed after they had sus
tained severe losses.
The city of Santiago de Cuba is in a state of
panic and food is becoming scarcer every day.
LATERâ I have received the following advices
from Santiago de Cuba: Yesterday morning from
half past 10 to half past 11 the American fleet
reopened fire on the batteries. Details are lack
ing.
Yesterday twenty American ships could be

()X BOARD THE ASSO
CIATED PRESS DISPATCH
BOAT DAUNTLESS, OFF
SANTIAGO, via Kingston, Ja
maica. June 4. â Rear Admiral
Sampson, during Friday morn-r
ing, decided to close the narrow
harbor entrance to Santiago de
Cuba by sinking the collier Mer
rimac, loaded with coal, in the
channel. â¢ He called for volun
teers to go to almost certain
death, and 4000 men offered
themselves. Lieutenant H'obson
and seven men were chosen, and
at 3 a. m. Friday morning the
Merrimac, under her own steam,
entered the channel under a ter
rible Spanish fire.
The vessel was riddled with pro
jectiles, but she anchored and
swung around. Lieutenant Hob
son then set off an internal tor
pedo with an electric attachment.
There was an explosion, the Mer
rimac sank and the channel was
closed, and, apparently. Admiral
Cervera will be unable to escape.
KINGSTON. Jamaica, June 4.
â Hobson and the hero crew of
the Merrimac were saved in the
following manner: Unable, after
the sinking of their vessel, to
make their way back through the
! storm of shot and shell, they
rowed into the harbor to the
Spanish flagship and were taken
on board unharmed. The Span
ish Admiral, under a flag of truce.2
on Friday sent word to the Amer
ican Admiral that he offered to
exchange the prisoners, adding
that in the meanwhile Hobson
and his party would be treated
with the greatest kindness.
WASHINGTON. June 4.â
The only Hobson in the list of
officers in the naval register i?
Richmond P. Hobson. a naval
constructor, who is a lieutenant
of the junior grade. He was ap
pointed an assistant naval con
structor in 1891. He entered the
navy from Alabama.
DRIFTED ASHORE ON
AN OLD CATAMARAN.
How Hobson and His Brave Crew
Escaped After Sinking the
Merrimac.
KTXOSTOX, Jamaica, June 4âLieu
tenant Hobson appears to have car
ried out his: plan to the smallest de
tails, except as regards the methods
of escaping. The rowboat, in which
the crew were to attempt to escape,
was either blown up or shot to pieces,
for Lieutenant Hobson and his men
drifted ashore on an old catamaran,
"-which was slung over the ship's side
at the last moment as an extra precau
tion. Upon ranching shore the men
were taken prisoners and sent to San
tiago City undo! guard. Later they
were taken to Morro <'astle, where
they are now.
Captain Oveido, Admiral Cervera's
chief of. staff, who boarded the New
York under a flag of truce, does not
give further details of the capture.
The bravery of the Americans evi
dently excited a* much admiration
among the Spaniards as it did among
the men of the American fleet. The
prisoners will be perfectly safe and will
probably be well treated while they re
main in Morrn Castle. The fleet is wild
with delight to-night over the termina
tion of the most daring expedition since
the destruction of the Confederate iron
clad Albemaiie by Lieutenant Cush
ing in 1R64. The admiral is Just as glad
as the youngest Jackie.
Captain ("hadwick of the flagship
New York, who is usually conservative,
in speaking of the incident said:
"Splendid, splendid. Too much cannot
be said about it."
The general opinion is that no man
ever deserved recognition by Congress
for personal bravery more than does
Lieutenant Hobson. His work was well
done and his men are safe. When he
started on the expedition a few thought
he could accomplish his object. Offi
cers of the fleet who were questioned
as to whether Captain Oviedo could
have had any ulterior design in visit
ing the New York under a flag of truce
scouted the suggestion, saying that the
visit was prompted by pure chivalry on
the part of the Spaniards and was no
ble of them.
Clausen, the New York's coxswain,
went on the Merrimac against orders.
Nothing could have kept him from that
trip into the jaws of death. It is
probable that the Spaniards will try to
blow up the Merrimac, but improbable
that they will succeed. Speculation is
rife as to the exact details of how
Lieutenant Hobson managed to blow
himself and ship up and live to tell the
tale. His heroism has cleared up the
situation well. The Spaniards are now
doubly hemmed in.
At quarters of the New York last
evening Chaplain Royce, praying be
fore the bareheaded crew on deck,
thanked God for having preserved
Lieutenant Hobson and the men under
him.
Cadet Powell, who was the last man
to see Lieutenant Hobson before his
start and who had charge of the launch
during its perilous trip, after much
needed sleep told the story of his ex
perience. He paid:
"Lieutenant Hobson took a short
sleep for a few hours, which was of
ten interrupted. At a quarterof 2o'clock
he came on deck and made final in
spection, giving his last instructions.
Then we had a little lunch. Hobson
was as cool as a cucumber. About 2:30
o'clock I took the men who were not
going on the trip into the launch and
started for the Texas, the nearest ship,
but had to go back for one of the as
sistant engineers, whom Hobson finally
compelled to leave. I shook hands with
Hobson the last of all. He said:
'Powell, watch the boat's crew when
we pull out of the harbor. We will be
cracks, rowing thirty strokes to the
minute."
"After leaving the Texas I saw the
Merrimar steaming Slowly in. It was
only fairly dark then, and the shore
was quite visible. We followed about
three-quarters of a mile astern. The
Merrimac stood about a mile to the
westward of the harbor and seemed a
bit mixed, turning completely around,
finally heading east, then ran down
and turned in. We were then chafing
because I thought Hobson had lost his
bearings. When Hobson was about 200
yards from the harbor the first gun was
fired from the eastern bluff. We were
then half a mile off shore, close under
the batteries. The firing Increased
rapidly. We steamed in "slowly and
lost sight of the Merrimac in the smoke,
which the wind carried off shore. It
hung heavily.
"Before Hobson could have blown up
the Merrimac the western battery pick
ed up and commenced firing. They
shot wild, and we only heard the shots.
We ran In still closer to shore, and the
gunners lost sight of us. Then we
heard the explosion of the torpedoes on
the Merrimac.
"Until daylight we waited just out
ride the breakers, half a mile to the
westward of Morro, keeping a bright
lookout for the boat or for swimmers,
but saw nothing. Hobson had arranged
to meet us at that point, but thinking
that some one might have drifted out,
we crossed in front of Morro and the
mouth of the harbor to the eastward.
About 5 o'clock we crossed the harbor
again within a quarter of a mile and
stood to the westward.
"In passing we saw one spar of the

Merrimae sticking out of the water. We
hugged the shore just outside of the
breakers for a mile and then turned
toward the Texas, when the batteries
saw us and opened fire. It was then
broad daylight. The first shot fired
dropped eighty yards astern, but the
Other shots went wild. I drove the
launch for all she was worth, finally
making the New York. The men be
haved splendidly."
The news of Lieutenant Hobson's
safety lifted a great load from Powell's
mind. Probably no other details of this
marvelous trip will be known until
Lieutenant Hobson gets back.
Some heavy firing was done shortly
before midnight by the New York and
New Orleans, aimed at what was
thought to be a small gunboat, which
disappeared. - Whether she was sunk
or not is not known. The firing took
place to the eastward of Morro.
WITH THE AMERICAN FLEET

(Via Mole St. Nicholas, Hayti, June

expedition are safe. Only twi, of them
were slightly injured, and their names
are not known. Lieutenant Hobson
was not hurt. All of the Merrimac's
men are held as prisoners of war.
The news of their wonderful escape
was sent to Admiral Sampson by Ad

had not lost their lives. Admiral Cer

HEROES OF SANTIAGO
SOON TO BE EXCHANGED
No Time to Be Lost in Securing the
Release of Hobson and
His Men.
NEW YORK. June 4.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
Naval Constructor Hobson and the
seven brave men who assisted him in
sinking the Merrimao, who were all
taken prisoners by Admiral Cervera,
will be liberated as soon as possible.
It is the belief of the authorities here
that General Blanco and Admiral Cer
vera will not hesitate to agree to an
exchange of prisoners.
As soon as Admiral Sampson's report
of the sinking of the Merrimac and cap
ture of Naval Constructor Hobson and
his men had been received a confer
ence was held at the White House be
tween President McKinley and Secre
tary Alger and Assistant Secretary Al
len, at which it was decided to author
ize Admiral Sampson to open negotia
tions for the exchange of the prison
ers. The admiral was instructed by
cable to do so, and he was also told
to send at once the names and ratings
of. the men who were captured with
Constructor Hobson, so that arrange
ments can be made to exchange Span
ish prisoners of the same relative rank
for them.
Mr. Gollen, the British Consul-Gen
eral at Havana, who is charged with
looking after American interests in
Cuba during the war, will be negotiat
ing 1 with General Blanco for the ex
change at the same time that Admiral
Sampson, is negotiating with Cervera.
It is proposed that Spanish prisoners
now at Atlanta be taken to Key West
and transferred from there to Havana
under a flag pf truce at the same time
that Hobson and his men are delivered
to Sampson under a -flag of truce at
Santiago. Secretary Alger told me this
afternoon that there were enough
Spanish prisoners of war at Atlanta
to exchange for all the Americans who
were captured at Santiago, and that
he was satisfied there would be no trou
ble in arranging the exchange.
SAMPSON WILL NOT
LOSE HIS ADVANTAGE
So the Admiral Is Not Likely to
Permit the Bemoval of the
Merrimac Wreck.
WASHINGTON, June 4.â The naval
situation i& believed to be entirely sat
isfactory. Notwithstanding the Span
ish reports of the clearing away of the
Merrimac, it is not believed for an in
stant that Sampson will submit to los
ing this so dearly purchased advantage,
and he can be relied upon to prevent
the removal of the obstruction.
The Spanish fleet caged inside the
harbor, there to remain until they are
starved out or surrender, Sampson will
be free to detach most of his powerful
squadron for service elsewhere. This
means, according to common belief,
immediate attack upon San Juan.
Of the Cadiz fleet no fear is enter
tained. Notwithstanding the many pub
lished reports, probably an- ascribable
to Spanish ingenuity, to the effect that
this fleet has already started for either
the West Indies or the Philippines, it
can be stated that the Government has
information which it regards as reli
able that the Snanifih fleet had not left
Cadiz up to yesterday.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JUNE 5, 1898.
LEADER OF THE BAND OF NAVAL HEROES.
Richmond Pearson Hobson is a native of Alabama and entered the Naval Academy May
21, 1885, at the early age of 14 years 9 months. He was the youngest naval cadet at the academy,
but by natural ability and hard study managed to get pretty close to the top and stood No. 3 at
the yearly examinations in the fourth and third class. His competitors for the lead were A. B.
Hoff, now an ensign in the line, and G. H. Rock, assistant naval constructor. At the examination
in June, 1888, Hobson jumped to the head of the class and held it for the next two years, graduat
ing in 1889 No. lin the class of thirty-five. His records during the four years' course were as fol
lows at the annual examinations:
June., 1886 68.25 credits out of 76 possible.
June, 1887 ' 134-75 credits out of 152 possible.
June. 1888 196.23 credits out of 228 possible.
June, 1889 274.40 credits out of 304 possible.
Total for four years. 673.63 credits out of 760, or 88.6 per cent.
In conformity to the system at the Naval Academy which assigns cadets to the different
branches of the naval service according to their preference and proficiency. Hobson and Rock
were selected for the Naval Constructors' Corps, to which the cream of the school goes.
In October, 1890, Hobson was sent to Paris to go through a course of naval architecture
at the Polytechnical School, and returned three years later with honors. He was promoted to as
sistant naval constructor July I, 1891, and in January last stood No. 1 on the list, ready for the pro
motion which is sure to follow his unprecedented exploit.
During the war in the Orient, Hobson was selected by the Secretary of the Navy, upon the
recommendation of Chief Constructor Hichborn, to represent the United States Navy on Japan
ese war vessels, where he could have an opportunity to personally observe modern warfare at sea.
The Bureau of Navigation, under Commodore Ramsay, and the entire line corps made such de
cided objections to what they considered an innovation upon their prerogatives, that the project
was reluctantly abandoned and Assistant Constructor Hobson was left to improve his knowledge in
doing duty at the bureau and at the New York navy yard up to the time when the man and the
occasion seem to have met and fitted.
The act of Mr. Hobson, as an assistant naval constructor, and as such a staff officer with
the complimentary rank of junior lieutenant, cannot but be as highly gratifying to all grades in the
navy as it is to his country at large. It points a leson that no particular branch in the navy has a
right to arrogate to itself all the honors when the dangers and hardships of warfare are shared by
all. There were probably other line officers, with the actual rank which is only grudgingly be
stowed upon staff officers, who were desirous to undertake the work which called for forlorn hope
volunteers, yet Mr. Hobson was chosen and did what was expected of him.
SAMPSON'S REPORT.
WASHINGTON, June 4.â The Navy Depart
ment at 3 o'clock received the following dispatch:
"Mole, Hayti, June 4.â Succeeded in sinking
the Merrimac in the channel of Santiago at 4
A. M. June 3. This was carried out most gal
lantly under the command of Naval Constructor
Hobson and seven men. By a flag of truce from
the Spanish admiral, Cervera, sent in recogni
tion of their bravery, I am informed that all
are prisoners of war, two slightly wounded.
Request authority to approve exchange, if possi
ble, between these and prisoners at Atlanta.
Six of the Spanish squadron are in the harbor
of Santiago unable to avoid being captured or
destroyed. SAMPSON."
IMMEDIATE
INVASION OF
PORTO RICO
NEW YORK, June 4.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent sends the
following,: Porto Rico is now to be the
principal place of operation for the
American forces. The obstruction of
the harbor of Santiago de Cuba by
the pinking of the collier Merrimac
will undoubtedly hasten the movement
that is to be made on San Juan.
I was informed to-day by an officer
in high authority that Porto Rico was
now the point for almost immediate
attack. The United States will be able
to move part of its fleet thither ffom
Santiago de Cuba.
There is no change in the programme
of sending an army to Santiago de
Cuba. In fact it is now en route. In
the opinion of the administration it
would be perfect folly to send an army
to Porto Rico consisting entirely of
volunteer troops. Of course it would be
necessary, owing to the small size of
our regular army, to have the army
partly made up of volunteers, but a
number of regular regiments will be
bers of the crew of th- latter have been
imprisoned. The rest of the enemy's
squadron Immediately retired.
The Spanish version also says that
two ironclads were seriously dam
aged during the engagement. The
Spaniards describe the affair as a bril
liant Spanish victory.
It is officially announced here that
the Spanish Government has received
further dispatches regarding the al
leged victory of the Spaniards at San
tiago de Cuba, but that they will not
be published until they have been con
veyed to the Queen Regent. In the
Meanwhile the report has circulated
that the Spaniards have captured "nu
merous Americans."
The Minister of Marine, Captain Au-.

HERALD AND CALL
SCORED A "BEAT"
NEW YORK. June 4.â The Evehing Telegram says:
The Herald this morning was the only paper that told
the real facts attending the sinking of the Merrimac
at the mouth of Santiago harbor. While other papers
were floundering about in attempting to show how
or why she was destroyed the Herald's special cable
dispatch from Cape Haytien ascribed the sinking of
the ship. to Admiral Sampson's purpose to blocK the
harbor entrance and thus prevent the escape of the
Spanish fleet. All the news that reached this city to
day came frorr) the Herald's story, even to the state
ment that the men who tooK the Merrimac into San
tiago harbor volunteered their services for this dan
gerous worl^.
taken from the Fifth army corps.
General Shafter will command the
army at Santiago de Cuba, and Gen
eral Lee will probably command the
army at Porto Rico and be appointed
by the President as Military Governor
of that island. A large force of light
artillery and a corps of infantry and
cavalry will accompany the Porto Rico
expedition.
Active preparations are now being
made in Washington to have the
army designated for Porto Rico ready
to move on the shortest notice. Trans
ports for this army are being chartered
each day. Assistant Secretary Meikle-
John to-day added two first-class ships
to the list of the Government's trans
ports on the Atlantic coast. These
are the Macon and Gate City, which
will be turned over to the Government
at Savannah. Ga. The Louisiana and
Comancho have been ordered to leave
immediately from New York and Sa
vannah. These new boats make a
total of thirty-nine transports that
have been chartered on the Atlantic
coast.
' and read to the Queen Regent an offl
j cial dispatch on the subject of the re
j cent fight at Santiago de Cuba, the
I text of which is as follows:
"At 3 o'clock on Friday morning one
of the enemy's large cruisers and an
auxiliary cruiser attempted to force an
I entrance Into the harbor of Santiago
de Cuba.
"They surprised the scouts guarding
the entrance, but not the artillery at
Fort Morro. The guns of the cruiser
Reina Mercedes, a battery from the
Relna Mercedes, which had been placed
In the Socapa Fort, a torpedo-boat de
stroyer and a torpedo-boat opened fire
on the enemy.
"The American cruiser^ the Merri
mac, was sunk h- our vessels and tor
pedoes, and a large American cruiser
was repulsed at the entrance to the
channel.
"The Reina Mercedes captured one
lieutenant and seven sailors of the
Merrimac. The fate of the rest of
the crew is not known."
The official dispatch adds that twen
ty American ships are before Santiago
de Cuba.
The Queen Repent. It is announced
here, has ordered that a message of
congratulation be telegraphed to the
defenders of .Santiago de Cuba.
The Minister of Marine later In the
day said the wreck of the Merrimac
would not interfere with navigation at
the entrance of the harbor, and he
added that the coal on board the Merri
mac could be recovered and used by the
Spaniards. ,
In the Chamber of Deputies to-day
'Senor Silvela, the Conservative leader,
congratulated the Government on the
"good news from Santiago de Cuba,"
and Senor Salmeron, the Republican
leader, proposed that the congratula
tions of the House be Sent to the Span
ish naval and military leaders in Cuba.
The motion was carried.
Great enthusiasm prevails in the city
over the Spanish reports of the en
gagement at Santiago. Premier Sa
gasta and Captain Aunon, the Minis
ter of Marine, upon leaving the palace,
after informing the Queen Regent of
the affair, told the representatives of
the newspapers that the object of the
Americans was not to force, but to
block the entrance to the channel. Ad
miral Cervera, they allege, was aware
of the intentions of the Americans and
ordered part of his squadron outside to
defend the entrance.
The official dispatches from Santiago
also said that when the Merrimac sank
Admiral Cervera, who was on board a
Spanish warship near by, entered a
small boat and "personally saved the
survivors, who were swimming in the
water."
The people of Madrid consider San
tiago impregnable, basing their belief
on the fact that the defenses of that
place were constructed by the celebrat
ed expert, Ordonez.
ADMIRE AUDACITY
*0F THE AMERICANS.
Even Spaniards at Santiago Praise
the Eravery of Hobson and
â¢ His Men.
PORT AU PRINCE, June 4.â Further
news received here from Santiago de
Cuba confirms the reports that the
bombardment of that place began at 3
o'clock yesterday morning. After the
action the Spaniards blew up with
dynamite the sunken collier Merrimac,
and have since been at work clearing
the channel so as to, in all probability,
permit Admiral Cervera's fleet to put
out to sea should the Cadiz squadron,
under Admiral Camara, arrive in Cu
ban waters to relieve the blockaded
ship*.
In? the meanwhile dispatches from
Santiago de Cuba say the Spaniards
pay tribute to the audacity of the
Americans in so cleverly attempting to
blockade the channel. According to the
Spanish it would be foolishness on the
part of the Americans to attempt to
force the harbor entrance, which is de
scribed as being low and narrow and
thoroughly mined, seemingly forming
an insurmountable barrier.
There are a gre^t number of insur
gents in the vicinity of Santiago, prob
ably waiting for some decisive action
on the part of the American fleet,
which undoubtedly will be the signal
for a land attack upon the town.

But Sampson Did Not Feel Like
Waiting for Barges From New-

WASHINGTON, June 4.â ljt is now
known that the Navy Department
about ten days ago was considering a
plan for closing the harbor at Santi' c "
very similar in general scope ,to that
apparently put into execution yester

hulks or scows and to fill them with big
boulders, such as could be easily ob
tained in the neighborhood of New
York.
These were to be lashed on either side

of a tug and run Into the harbor, and '
at the proper time were to be scuttled.
Provision was to be made for the
safety of the crew by attaching to the
tug a torpeda-boat stern foremost. At
the proper nfbment the crew was to go
aboard the torpedo-boat, scuttle the
hulks by an electrical contrivance, and, ;
cutting loose from the hulks, make a
rush for liberty and the open sea. There
are signs that yesterday's project was j
a development of this idea. Probably i
the plan of taking in scows was reject- '
ed by Sampson so as not to waste time
in waiting for such craft.
FRENCH MERCHANTS
EXPRESS FRIENDSHIP.
Copyrighted, IS9B, by James Gordon Bennett.
PARIS, June 4.â The firm of Messrs.
Keiper is one of the largest in the Fau
bourg. Antoine M. Coline, one of the j
members of the firm, says that neither I
in his personal relations with those j
about him nor among his workmen j
has he found the slightest hostility to
Americans.
"As to our American customers, I
need scarcely tell you how much store
I set by them and I can assure you
personally that I sympathize with the
United States; but, you see, the war is
badly understood here. It is regarded
as a war of conquest. As to the hos- j
tile feeling agaii.st the United States
you speak of, which is used against us
on the other side, it is not difficult to
determine whose interest it is to em
broil France and the United States. It
is the English. I believe the mischief
started with the newspapers, or at
Least certain newspapers, but it ap- !
pears to me their tone is already less
aggressive."
M. Mercier, the head of another very
large concern, expressed regret at the
general effect of the war on trade.
"As to your question, I can only re- I
ply emphatically, expressing my sym- i
pathies with the Americans, whose >
I genius we admire equally in business I
i affairs and in science, and from whom
Iwe borrow so much. In fact our hab
| its are becoming yearly more and more
American, whereas there is no affinity i
! between the Spaniards and the |
French."
I continued my inquiries among fur
niture and tapestry makers in Rue de
la Perini.
"We cannot understand," said MM.
Perichet and Belzac, "how the senti
ments of the French people can have
been travestied so as to create the be
lief that they are ill-disposed toward
j Americans. Personally our sympa
| thies are entirely with the Americans,
but even if they were not, our inter
ests and the true interests of France
are clearly on the side of the United
States. As to our working people, it
is very difficult to ascertain their sent
iments, but we believe them to be ab
solutely indifferent."
SIGNAL CORPS BALLOON
SQUAD CALLED UPON.
CHICKAMAUGA, June 4.â Some ex
citement was created at camp to-day
when rush orders were received for the
balloon squad of the Signal Corps,
which has been practicing here for a
month or more, to report at once to
Major E. J. Maxfield, chief of the vol
unteer Signal Corps at Tampa. The
squad left at noon for Tampa.
SPAIN'S POSITION
ALMOST HOPELESS
ST. PETERSBURG. June 4.â The
Novoe Vremya says that the sympathy
of most of Europe is undoubtedly with
Spain in the present conflict with the
United States, but there is no denying
the fact that her position is almost
hopeless. Continuing, the Novoe
Vremya says: "After all, Cuba is not
worth Spain's exhausting her resources
to- retain it."

GOLD LOST WITH THE
WRECKED CLARA NEVADA
Force of Men Attempting to Recover
Treasure From the Sunken
Vessel.
VANCOUVER, June 4.â The most inter
â¢ sting news brought from- the North by
the Tartar, which arrived early this
morning;, is that strenuous efforts are
being raaiip to Ret at gold supposed to
have gone down with the 111-fated Clara
Nevada. The wreck is near Eldred Rock,
thirty miles south of Bkaguay. When
the Tartar passed the spot a tup, a scow
and BeveraJ small boats and a dozen men
with complete diving outfits were at
work.
Pilot Jones of the Tartar is responsible
for the statement that there in $100,000 in
gold, brought out by Klondikers, in the
wreck. Just b* fore he left Bkaguay, he
says, he met a man named Wilson from
Sea til i who claimed to have been ac
quainted with several of the Nevada's
passengers and who had a brother on the
craft. This brother had 138.000 in gold,
which he took on board, and a fellow pas
senger had $60,000 or (70.000 in gold.
The present operations ore for the pur
pose of petting at this gold and also to
obtain, if possible, the purser's books, by
which the names of the passengers can
be ascertained. The wreckers have
worked so quietly that their operations
are hardly known in Skaguay. and it is
not known that they are expected to in
terfere with the wreck. Pilot Jones says
that in a few days full particulars of the
wreck will be made public. He is confi
â¢ i'-iii that Wilson's story of gold in the
wreck Is correct.

Recent Arrival From Cuba Believes

There.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, June 4.â Louis Duany
has arrived in this city from Jamaica.
He left Santiago de Cuba on May 18.
Mr. Duany does not believe Cervera's
fleet is at Santiago. He says:
"I think Cervera's fleet may have
been confused with five Spanish boats
which were In the harbor when I left.
These were El Relna Mercedes, a sec
ond-class cruiser; El Conde Benadito,
El Marquis de Molin. auxiliary cruisers
with heavy guns, and two gunboats.
El Sandoval and La Estralla.
"The cruiser Reina Mercedes is dis
abled, her boilers having broken down,
and she was lying just inside the en
trance to the harbor. Her guns were
removed to the fortifications.
"The Spaniards laid a few mines last
winter, but on May 5 the work began
on a larger scale. I saw men at this work
in the harbor for some time afterward,
and about seventy mines have been
laid altogether. The first line of six
mines is laid directly across the mouth
of the harbor from Morro Castle to
the buoy which marks the shallow
water line near La Soeapa. the fortress
opposite. Directly behind the first
mines are line of four and three mines
each, so that the entrance to the har
bor is well laid with mines. The other
mines are along the ship channel for
six miles to the docks. The mines are
all connected by wires with the shore.
"I visited all of the forts, and I am
sure that the only modern guns in use
are those taken from the cruiser Reina
Mercedes. There are two of these guns
at Morro and the others are at La So
capa and Punta Gorda.
'There are 160 soldiers at Morro, BO
at La Soeapa, 30 at Punta Oorda and
100 ;it Punta Blanca. The principal
magazine is at El Polivan. The soldiers
at the forts are well armed and well
equipped, but I do not believe that they
are good gunners â at least, I never saw
them practice during my stay of eight
months. Tftere are 15,000 troops in the
province of Santiago under the com
mand of General Pando and SOOO in the
city of Santiago and outlying towns,
under the command of General Toval
and General Lilarez. They are well
ordered troops and well armed."
Mr. Duany said that there was a sup
ply of 7000 ' tons of coal at Santiago
when he left. Fresh meat was very
dear. _____

GUNBOAT MARIETTA
REACHES KEY WEST
During the Voyage Up the Atlantic
Officers and Crew Were Anxious
for a Fight.
KEY WEST, June 4.â The United
States gunboat Marietta, Commander
Simmons, arrived here at 7:30 o'clock
this morning from California, which
State she left last March. The trip
was uneventful, and there was not even
a case of slrkr."ss on board. Much of
the voyage was made In company with
the battle-ship Oregon, and the first
question of thf Marietta's officers was
as to the Oregon's whereabouts.
After the Marietta passed Cape Horn
| she kept a sharp lookout for the Span
j ish torpedo-boat Temerario, which was
supposed to be hunting for the Ore
gon. The Marietta's officers were very
anxious to meet the Spaniard, and they
say that if a meeting had taken place
they would have surely sunk her. Dur
ing the entire voyage they sighted only
half a dozen vessels.
When the Marietta left Rio Janeiro
the men on board had heard no war
news later than the first bulletin of
Rear-Admiral Dowey's victory at Ma
nila. The Marietta anchored on her
arrival here and hoisted a flag for a
doctor. Pending his arrival no one
was allowed to leave or come aboard
the vessel, and the correspondents
shouted a brief summary of the war
news to the officers, the report of which
caused much laughing and rejoicing.
The Marietta is painted black. Her
course was through Providence chan
nel, and she saw no warships in West
Indian waters.
Old Sol in Evidence.
PACIFIC GROVE, June 4.â The hottest
weather ever known in this section was
I experienced here to-day. At 3 p. m. the
thermometer registered S6 degrees, the
heat continuing oppressive until sundown.
j A i.irge brush tire in -.he hills southeast
of Monterey added greatly to the oppres
siveness of the atmosphere in the immedi
ate neighborhood, and created dense over
hanging smoke that the light breeze did
not carry away.
SANTA CRUZ, June 4.â The weather
was unusually warm to-day, the mercury

LAST STRANDS OF THE
CUBAN CABLES SEVERED
â¢
Now the Island Is Wholly Isolated
From the Outside World.
OFF SANTIAGO DE CUBA. June 2.â
5 p. m. â (Per the Associated Press
Boat Wanda, via Kingston, June 4).â
The last cable strands binding Cuba to
the outside world were cut this after
noon by a cable vessel convoyed here
by the United States dispatch gunboat
Dolphin. This black sea crab delved
all day along the coast, hour by hour.
and its powerful claws at length
brought up the barnacle-clustered cable
strands and snapped them, and to-night
Cuba is wholly isolated.
The lirst cable picked up was that
running to Kingston. It was found
early this morning. The coast loop
connecting Santiago and Guantanamo
was then cut. Proceeding to Guanta
namo, the cable vessel finally grappled
and severed the Hay^len cable.
This ends the cable-cutting opera
tions begun a month ago, when the
Marblehead and the Window lost five
men In a fight off Oienfuegos, where
three cables were crippled and several
hundred Spaniards killed by shells from
the warships. Afterward the St. Louis
and the Wampatucket cut the San
Juan de Porto Rican cable at Santi
ago. The strands cut to-day were the
only ones remaining, except a few coast
loops, and these will probably be sev
ered in a short time.
The cutting of these cables is almost
as serious for the Spaniards In coast
towns as The cutting of foreign cables,
the land wires connecting the coast
towns being wholly at the mercy of the
insurgents. Therefore, in the event
of American troops landing in Cuba,
the absence of the coast loops will ser
iously Interfere with the hasty mobili
sation of the Spanish troops.
The United States and Hayti Cable
Company, and the Commercial cable
Company, have not been notified < t
any interruption of the service and
they were still accepting messages this
morning for Cuba.
SPAIN'S BANKRUPTCY
AND THE BEARING ON WAR
Spaniards Absurdly Undei'estimate
the Terms Uncle Sam Will
Demand.
NEW YORK, Junp 4.â A dispatch
from London says: In European eyes
the economic condition of Spain is be
coming the most important aspect of
the war, and the anxiety of the Haute
Finance over it has prompted the re
cent dispatches about the Spanish de
sire for peace. Trustworthy letters
from Madrid Bay the Spaniards ab
surdly underestimate the terms of
peace which the I'nited States is likely
to entertain, and talk about them is
only vague speculation, chiefly among
the uneasy commetctal class. Men of
judgment and knowledge of the dispo
sition of the Continental nations expect
few results from Castillo's sounding of
the powers, unless a decisive naval bat
tle is fought meantime.

BLOW TO
SPY SYSTEM
OF SPAIN
Seized Letter of Lieutenant
Carranza Is Made
Public.
Intercepted Information Enabled
This Government to Keep Track
of Spanish Vessels.
NEW YORK, June 4.â A Washington !
special to the Herald says: Spain's
spy system has sustained a serious blow
as the result of the seizure by secret
service agents of the United States of
the famous Oarranza letter. That let- j
ter, with the exception of one para- |
graph, was officially made public by
tary Gage to-day. It has been
in the possession of Chief Wilkie of
the secret service here since May 28,
and its contents have been of inesti
mable value to the four branches of the
Government, the naval, military, dip
lomatlc, and secret service.
This letter has enabled the military
arm of the Government to take action
with a complete understanding of the
position of the Spanish reserve Bquad
rr>n. and of Admiral Cervera's fleet, to
both of which Lieutenant Carranza re
fers In his letter, and this knowledge !
may have been one of the reasons why
naval officials confidently declared for
the last week that Cervera was safely
located in the harbor of Santiago de
Cuba.
Now that the letter has been made
public officials do not hesitate to tell
v to the manner In which it was ob
tain.d. Every day since the arrival
of Dubosc and Carranza in Montreal
secret service agents have been in their
home, either on pretense of examining
tho gas meter, attending to sewerage or
inspecting the water pipe. One of these
men saw Carranza writing <>n May 25
a letter, which he surmised might con
tain highly interesting information. He |
reported his discovery to Chief Wilkie, j
â uhn arranged a call at the house next
morning, and the officer, accompanied
by a companion and a woman, was ad
mitted soon after 8 o'clock and exam- !
ined the house with a view to renting
it. Lieutenant Carranza was at break
fast at the time. When insi>ectlng the
bedroom the American officer dis
covered a sealed envelope lying
on the dresser. He slipped it
into his pocket and left thf: |
house, mailing the communication to a i
fellow detective, who forwarded it to |
Washington. <>n one side of the en
velope were three Canadian stamps,!
two 3-eent and one 2-cent stamp. The |
letter was written in a fine hand on |
paper bearing the seal of the former
legation in Washington and was ad
dressed to Senor Gomez, apparently
Carranxa's uncle.
Appended Is the fun text of Car
ranza's letter, with the exception of the
paragraph withheld by Secretary Oage:
Montreal, Que., May 20. 1898,
42 Tupper street.
His Excellency Benor Don Jose
Gomez Imayâ My I>ear Ron Jose: It
was my belief that they would have ap
pointed you to command the Cadiz fleet.
and it was my Intention to have s<-nt you
a telegram unking that you take me with
you. to meet you in the Antilles or wher
ever you might say. The case has not
turned out thus, however, and it seems
as though God were not on our side, he
cau.se the election of Senor Camara I fear
W;.l be fatal, although he may have a
good cbief-of-staff. No one could possi
bly suit him, because he is very cap
ricious, and besides is not a very hard
worker; on the contrary, he is lazy and
would pay no attention to the advice of
any one. You will not take this for flat
tery, but to-day no one but you and Don
Pasquale should have command of our
and this is the belief of the younger
<l< ment of the personnel, Now there is
no remedy, and may God shed his light
upon and keep him in his bands. I wrote
to the Minister, and with the confidence
due to my Bpecial ilutW-s I said to him.
on sending a clipping from a newspaper
containing a telegram from Cadiz, speak
ing of our fleet and of its admiral, that
it was not Rcnor Camara, but you who
should command it and that we. the
lower personnel, who travel about a lit
tle, know you very well. It may be that
this action may have had a bad impres
sion on him, but 1 don't care, because if
1 ' an do so i shall leave the service when
the war Is finished. 1 have been left here
to receive and send telegrams and to look
after the Bervice which I have organized,
and I had better say am. established here'
because until a little while ago I was not
permitted to do as I pleased.
We have had bad luck because they
havo captured our two best spies, one in
Washington, who hanged himselfâ or els->
thf*y did itâ and the other day before yes

showing the most extraordinary vigi
lance. I do not wish to remain hem witn

I di sire duty in which I can take the
Initiative and do something. I sha.ll be
extremely gratified to have a ship in or
der to run the blockade or a to"pedo
boat; anything rather than playing sec
ond fiddle. However, if there is iv other
remedy I would go perfectly willingly on
board a large ship. I am very sorry that
this war linds me so low in rank, and it
offers opportunities for any ode who
wished to work and to risk "himself. 1
cannot believe that Don Pasquale could
be in Santiago, as reported by the Ameri
can press. He entered it on the lSth, and
if he had pone immediately to Havana he
would bave met only two monitors in
front of it. I make out that he entered
that place only to coal and for the moral
effect it would have in Spain. 1 suppose
he went nut Saturday, the 20thâ If ho had
gone to the north and through the Provi
i!> ace Channel he would have passed into
Havana right under the nose of the
Americans, who had only small cruisers,
for Bchley waa at sea on the night of
Thursday. Sampson on that of Friday
and on thai of Sunday, the 22d, he took
the lower channel for the east and on
Wednesday turned back toward Havana.
Schley'a squadron has been reinforced by
the lowa and Bampson by the Oregon.
The Vizcaya and Oquendo, at least, need
go Into the drydock. 1 telegraphed to
Don Pasquale on the morning of the 20th,
when 1 knew he was in Santiago, saying
that the squadrons were at Key VVest.
He did not answer me. That afternoon
came a telegram from Madrid saying he
bad left Santiago. 1 continued sending
messages to General Hlanco in respect to
all the movements, and now, so far as I
know. Don Pasquale has arrived at Porto
Rico, where 1 shall try to communicate
with him.
I( he should have set out for Marti-!
nlrjuc or Havana, having twenty-four i
hours" advantage, he would have arrived '
before now. 1 am vr^ much afraid lost!
they attack Porto Rico by land and sea
and put off the attack on Havana. They !
art- not K<>ing t<> do mure than try to
take the latter, nnd they think then, if
; destroy "Ur fleet, of taking the war
[nto Spain, with Havana already in their
power. They have no confidence in their
army, nut they have in their navy, and
tiny are afraid of our army and of yel
low fever, because if the men should'be
gin to die in Cuba there would be a tre
mendoua row. ae they are rot like our
people. Anyway, we shall see when there
is news of the ileet. I expert it to-mor
row. With them cleaning their hulls at
the keys we should i>p able to clean some
thing in three days at Porto Ilico. Each
day thai passes is worse for us on ac- :
count of the almost total lack of prepara
tlon.
The Cnrliz squadron Is to come to bom
bard Boston. Portland nnd Lonp Island
They can do it now. but after a few
months it would be too late. I think If
we are to have any success In this mat
t.-r it will be throuph treating for peace
by yleMinc Cuba and having them recog
nize the oVM. If wo do not do this soon
it will be too lntc, and we shall lose Cuba
and Porto Rim. and all that this war
hns cost us, and In addition we shall be
Charged with the Cuban debt, for which
our treasury is responsible. There is no
doubt here thai we cannot continue this
war, as we have nothing to pain and may
lose our three colonies and be ruined for
fifty years. In the matter of money there
la no patriotism. Proof Is plven by the
bank, which ought to have bought gold'
although at a premium of 100 per cent'
and issued notes against It in small or
slightly great quantity. With 150,000,000 it
has made 1.3A0.W0.000. . â¢"""â¢""" II
This is the moment of the year at which
instead of returning 23 or 24 per cent it
returns only 12 or 15 per cent. As regards
its buying gold, exchange has gone down
and if. Instead of buying 400 000 000 it I*l
sues -,00,000.000, paying COO or 700, Inasmuch
:ts the state subscribes at the rate of 5
ppr cent, and would represent to the bank
fin Interest of about 3 per cent Its
dividend would have gone down very
little. The bank is the nation and with
the nation It has grown rich by offering
paper money, which it did not have in its
treasury, nnd by getting interest on that
which it really never had given out But
whatever the bank does, nobody 'dares

I should be glad to have you write me

the steamers Matteawan, Stillwater,
Breakwater, Aransas and Morgan.
Along the river front thousands of

were in sight.
The troops were quartered on the
vessels by 10 o'clock last night and had
a good night's rest. Reveille was
sounded at 5 o'clock and the last prep
arations for the voyage made. Some
200 horses had to be loaded on the Mor
gan, and this and othrr work delayed
the departure. The five vessels pulled
out together and formed a procession
down the river. The last seen of the
transports was from the Custom-house
as they passed the channel, the vessels
being half a mile apart, until they be
came specks on the horizon. It is be
lieved their ultimate destination is
Santiago de Cuba.

San Francisco awaiting transportation
to Manila.
Each of the special trains consisted
of twelve first-class Pullman cars,
which previously had been running as
tourists' cars to the Pacific Coast. It
will take just four days to make the
trip, the railroads having contracted to
place the troops in California ninety

SIGNS OF PEACE
ARE MULTIPLYING
So the Campaign Against Porto Rico
Island Must Now Be
Hurried.
WASHINGTON, June 4.â Peace signs
have been multiplying. There has
been a notable change in the tone of
the Spanish press, and although up to
this moment no advances have been
made to the State Department by any
of the European powers there is an in
definable suggestion in the air that any
moment may bring forth overtures of
this kind. For this reason the cam
paign against Porto Rico will probably
be hurried in order to insure its posses
sion by the United States before peace
is attained.

UNTIL AUTUMN
German Opinion as to
Cuban Invasion.
DISEASE TO BE DREADED
MILITARY EXPERTS EXPRESS
THEIR VIEWS.
One General Does Not Believe the
Volunteers Will Stand Against
Spain's Seasoned
Soldiers.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BERLIN, June 4.â 1 have asked a
number of leading German military
authorities for their opinions in regard
to the present situation in Cuba and
the possibilities of an invasion of the
island on the part of the United States.
I may say at once that their unanim
ous verdict is that it would be an act
of folly for America to land troops in
Cuba at present; that the coming au
tumn would be the earliest practicable
time; that a force of 100,000 would be
required for the work, and that even
then the Government ought to make
the venture only when 200,000 men are
in reserve to replace those who, in the
common course of events, must melt
away within a few weeks after landing
in the tropical land.
Lieutenant-General Yon Buguslaw
ski has three campaigns to his creditâ
those of 1864, 1H66 and 1870-71. He gave
me his views as follows:
"I cannot say that I have thorough
ly gone into the details of this busi
ness, but it strikes me that the States
are in a similar difficulty with regard
to their troops to that of France in 1870
after her regular army had been de
stroyed. The American army, or what
they are organizing as such, would. I
suppose, fairly compare with the
French Garde Mobile and Garde Na
tional Mobilize. The latter, from a
military point of view, were of less
value than the former. Although these
troops fought on occasion with great
bravery, and although in I'aris they
had several months in which to train
them, they yet, as a rule, could stand
up against seasoned regular troops
only when in numerical superiority of
four or even five to one.
"I have no doubt the Americans will
be able to effect a landing, but even
here it is as well to bear in mind that
the landing must be effected quickly.
If Marshal Blanco is wise he will keep
his troops well in hand in bodies of
from 25,000 to 35,000 men and give battle
to the United Suites troops as soon as
they set fo<rt on Cuban soil. He will
probably boat them, more probably bo
as the effects of the hot climate will in
all likelihood tend to seriously handi
cap further the untried American sol
diers, both morally and physically."

NEW YORK, June 4.â A Washington
m What is it? It is the only producer of strength and manliness. That is a
M large claim. But it is founded on facts as strong as the everlasting hills. Many .
m men are weak. Most of them are weak because of excesses in early life. Twenty
M thousand of them have applied to the Hudson Medical Institute for treatment. . .- .
M 20,000 of those who were weak are strong to-day. These 20,000 men were \A
iSr treated with "Hudyan." It is exaggerating, then, to say that "Hudyan" is the only *&
ft producer of strength and manliness? Certainly not. It cures all classes of '^L
m weakness. Is it nature's own remedy. You have overworked your brain. "Hud- Â»k
of yan" replaces the wasted gray matter. You have taxed your stomach too \\ \ j
3 heavily. "Hudyan" supplies digestive power. We might go on indefinitely, but
pf that would be uninteresting. "Hudyan," in one word, makes up for all loss of M
!9 vital force. The abuse of the power given you once was stupid folly. But -'it is M
m never too late to mend." This grand remedio-treatment saves manhood, and it Â§i
\ If you suffer from debilitation of any nature all you need do is to write to tbe Institute, f .
m or call there if you can, and ask for proof of these statements. Circulars and testimonials m .
M showing what "Hudyan" has done for weak and puny men are sent you with pleasure, and you m â â 
% can get the best medical advice that there is in the wide world free. If you have blocd taint m
% say so, and you will be told what you should do and what "30-day blood cure" will do for you. Â£g
\ No single cent of expense to you. Then why not have what is so freely oflered ? You want m
1 % to have a clean system and you want to be a manly man. You know that. Then why not M
% put out one effort ? If there was 110 proof offered it would te a different matter. It is not m .

dispatch to the Herald says: Spain's
agents in Canada will receive their
passports from the British Government
provided the demand made by the
United States meets with compliance.
Perhaps the most Important result of
the seizure of Carranza's leter will lie
the disorganization of the Spanish spy
em by the loss of its Immediate
heads â Benor Don Juan Dubosc, for
merly First Secretary of the Spanish
Legation in Washington, and Lieuten
ant Carranza, formerly its naval at
tache.
Secretary of State Day informed Em
bassador Hay some days ago of the
admission made by Carranza that he
was organizing a spy system from
Montreal, and instructed him to lay
the facts before the British Govern
ment, with a request for the recall of
the lieutenant and Benor Dubosc on tho
ground that they were violating the
neutrality law of Great Britain by
using Canada as a base for operations
in securing information of value to
Spain in the present war.
Sir Julian Pauncefote was als- ad
vised of the action of Carranza, and it
is understood that the matter was
under discussion between that diplo-
I mat and Secretary Day at the State
j Department this afternoon. '
In view <d tho evidence submitted to
the British Government no doubt is
felt that the request made by this
Government will be complied with and
may be heard very Boon, as the Brit
ish Minister ;it Madrid hus acquainted
the British Foreign Office of the facts
and suggested that Senor Dubosc and
Lieutenant Carranza be recalled. If
; such action is not taken Lord Salis
bury will undoubtedly Instruct the D -
i minion Government to present the two
I Spanish officials with their passports.

HEROES OF THE NAVY.
AS the war progresses the fact becomes evident
that American heroes of the "sea do not belong
alone to tradition. The men on our ships to
day are as brave as the men who fought with Paul
Jones. The sailors with Sampson and Schley are
ready to give up life for country and honor. Where
danger calls the}' are anxious to go.
In all the annals of battle there has been no record
of nobler courage than that of the men who on board
the Merrimac sailed to what seemed certain death.
They did not have the inspiration of cannon roar,
they were not carried away by mad excitement; the
possibility that they would survive to tell the story
of their own daring did not occur to them.
"Greater love hath no man than this, than to lay
down his life for his friends."
Such was the love which buoyed the sailors of the
Merrimac as they steamed away toward hostile guns,
to waters known to be deadly with torpedoes. Each
instant as they advanced they must have expected
the final crash. Yet the eight brave men were chosen
from thousands who clamored for the chance to place
themselves upon the altar of their country. They
loved their country, were eager to die for it. What
people shall stand against a heroism which thus im
pels men willingly to die?
Xo matter what the war may bring forth, what
other heroes may have opportunity to grave deep in
the hearts of their countrymen the knowledge that
our navy is tilled with patriots, these eight men of the
Merrimac must be given a chapter in the proud his
tory to be written of the first unselfish war ever
waged.
Congress will give to Constructor Hobson and the
volunteers who went with him a medal apiece. The
. token will be handed down in every family, and with
Just pride will be told the story it commemorates.
;; There should be a more practical recognition. It
... :Vould be well to have the medals, but in addition
i : there ought to be a pile of yellow disks, the good gold
;. coin of this country, which aiter all is the most prac
'â / â  tical form by which- the gratitude and admiration of
â¢:. the country can find expression.
: . The' names of the men. excepting as to Hobson
;: himself: are as yet unknown, but they will soon be
;. ' familiar to the world. Hobson is not a line officer.
It has been the habit of line officers to regard those
: 6i his class as non-combatants and to look upon
thenr with at least implied contempt. They can do
â  this no more. In the time of supreme peril it was a
"non-combatant" who first said "I will go."
Dewey at Manila recognized the bravery of
Montijo. The Spanish at Santiago recognized the
valor of our intrepid eight. The horrors of war are
touched by such exhibitions with a gleam of light.
WHERE CUBfIN BREfID IS BUTTERED.
AMONG the reports which are current is one
that the Cubans are dissatisfied with the Amer
ican plan of invading Cuba. In all probabil
ity it is groundless, and yet the meager chance
that it may be correct is worth consideration.
When determination was reached to drive the Span
ish from Cuba there was no thought on the part of
anybody in authority of selfish motive. The only ob
ject was to give to the Cubans the government for
the establishment of which they had fought so bravely
and so long. If the Cubans know on which side their
bread is buttered they will accept the help tendered
and listen to none of the Spanish tales of duplicity.
For if they present a hostile front to the Americans
they will lose all they have staked in the game, save
the blessing of being subject to a civilized power in
â¢tead of a semi-barbarous one.
There is nothing which can stop the onward sweep
of the armies of the United States. If the Cubans
gather under the stars and stripes the island wrested
from Spain will belong to them. If they fail in this
the "stable government" promised will be the govern
ment of Uncle Sam. This circumstance is something
for the Cubans to think about, and if they have not
the sense to draw correct conclusions, surely they
have not sense to govern themselves.
It would be well for them to also bear in mind that
there is in this country a large and growing party
which does not care for the welfare of Cuba and sees
in the destruction of the Maine the solitary pretext
for war. This party has no patience with Cuba, and
regards the conquest there as bringing to America
all the spoil, as the legitimate fruit of conquest. The
act of Cubans in turning against the United States
would be welcomed as sweeping away the last ves
tige of excuse for fighting the battles of an alien
people. If the people prove ungrateful the party now
opposed to them will become dominant and the Cu
ban flag disappear from Cuba along with the flag of
Castile.
The Marietta lacks much in the matter of size as
compared with the Oregon, but she seems to be some
pumpkins herself.
For a man who so many times has been "completely
cut off." Blanco seems to keep a large number of fool
remarks in circulation.
THE UNIVERSAL PEACE UNION.
IT seems to be demonstrated that the white-winged
dove of peace and the American eagle don't fly
together, after war is declared, unless the dove has
transportation inside the eagle.
The American branch of the Peace Union has been
evicted from its quarters in Independence Hall, Phil
adelphia. The president, Mr. Love, addressed to the
(Jueen Regent a letter on April 21 in which he sug
gested that she grant independence to Cuba as a
means of averting war. But he accompanied this ad
vice with rather excessive compliments to her Majesty
and her people. Perhaps he sugar-coated his in
dependence pill rather thickly for diplomatic reasons,
but any way the sugar, as they say in the Custom
house, seemed to be the component of chief value,
and the letter came' near enough violating the statute
against holding correspondence with the enemy in
time of war to justify an outbreak against the Peace
Union and all its works.
For the sake of the work of an international or
ganization to promote peace in the world it is to be
regretted that President Love did not administer his
benevolent counsel a little earlier in the affair, before
war was on. He would then have saved himself and
the union from a position which will tend to discredit
its work in the future.
The misfortune of such organizations is that they
are possessed by too many dreamers and controlled
by inopportune people. In the hands of practical
men and women the Universal Peace Union has a
work in the enlargement of policies that make a breach
of the world's peace less likely. The international
rule that one country cannot be made the mere prey
of another, that war must have cause and provocation,
which rule has grown up with diplomacy, has very
much lessened the number and likelihood of wars.
Formerly a nation which had improved peace by
amassing the wealth that is the fruit of uninterrupted
industry was sure to be the prey of any predatory
nation strong enough to descend upon it. and its
wealth was looted when it had offered no cause of
war. The next advance made was in arbitration of
causes of war when one nation had provoked another.
Before an appeal to arms a way was offered by ar
bitration for the honorable recession from a position
which without such means of honorable withdrawal
would make a fight necessary.
In its platform of principles the International
Peace Union maps out for itself a policy in line with
diplomacy and arbitration, and practical men oper
ating its activities on that platform would be helpful
to governments. In its recent action, however, the
American branch of the union seems to have merely
succeeded in exasperating rather than in soothing
public sentiment, and has put its whole purpose at a
very great disadvantage.
We hope that the suggestion will not be taken as
the expression of a too militant spirit if we advise
the Peace Union that one way to secure peace is to
represent truthfully to the people of nations that are
edging toward war their respective conditions as to a
sure war footing. Spain has been kept in woeful
ignorance of public sentiment in the United States,
and in equal darkness as to our military resources
and capacity to strike crushing blows if we are forced
to do so. If President Love had requested the Span
ish vice-president of the Peace Union, Arturo de
Marceartu, to inform his people as to the facts exist
ing in the United States, the extent of our power,
that we have 10.000,000 men of military age and
fighting capacity, while Spain has a total population
of only 18.000.000. it is quite possible that a more
reasonable temper would have come to those hot

THE SUMMER GIRL.
WITH each returning June the civilized world
finds its attention distracted from business
by the appearance along the streets of that
vision of radiant loveliness known as the summer girl.
It is in vain that, sober common sense insists the
beauty is but the old winter girl in new drapery. The
senses, intoxicated with the delight of her joyous
presence, will not have it so. The charming creature
in the shirt waist has nothing suggestive of old girls
about her. She is a new creation. A miracle so
startling in her novelty that we might almost call her
fresh.
In bygone Junes the summer girl has shown her
self but tleetingly in the city, spreading her dainty
wings here only to fly away to the seashore, the
mountain heights or other idyllic spots far from the
marts of trade. She has revealed herself on the busy
streets only to let men see her beautiful new clothes
so that they might be beguiled to follow her to places
where there is no work, nor any toil, but only picnics
by day and dances by night and fair flirtations that
end with one man at one place at one hour only to
begin again at another hour in another place with
another fellow.
In this June, however, the summer girl is a
changed creature. As lovely as ever are the gar
ments of her and as winning as ever is her smile, but
her feet are not hastening from the city this year, and
it seems that her thoughts are not of flirtations. She
has become a soldier of the Red Cross. Her heart is
full of patriotism. Her hands are full of work. She
is as bright and inspiring as the starry banner itself,
and the feeling she excites b one of blessing as well
as of admiration.
All America honors the summer girl. California
looks upon her own with especial pride and reverence.
Nowhere is the summer girl more beautiful in any
year, and nowhere is she doing better work this June.
The ornament of our streets, the charm oi our lives,
the embodied spirit of patriotism and loyalty, she is
lovelier in her Red Cross work than ever at mid
day picnic or midnight dance. God bless her.
The Prince of Wales gives this country his sym
pathy, but does not want Spain to be damaged more
than necessary. A great many other people seem to
feel the same way, but if Spain will insist on getting
in front of our guns sympathy won't save her bruises.
Jim Parker of Arizona remarked on the scaffold
that he was getting something he did not deserve.
However little truth there may have been in the re
mark, it certainly created a better impression than a
promise to meet spectators of the affair in heaven.
While the wisdom of the Government in landing
mules here from Baltimore at a cost of $2.31 may not
be questioned, we confess to inability to discern that
these mules can pull any more or sing any better than
the California article at a third the price.
The weather sharp promises even hotter days than
the two which have just perspired their way into his
tory. There have been occasions on which he has
guessed badly, and there will be a general hope that
this will be another of them.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JUNE 5, 1898.
NO JUSTIFICATION FOR TYRANNY-
THE morning organ of the Democratic faction
which has captured the organization of th^ party
in this city justifies the action of the Demo
cratic State Committee on the ground that it was ne
cessary in order to beat Boss Rainey. It declares that
the recent elections have shown Rainey's strength to
comprise not over 2000 votes, and in order to protect
the other 30,000 Democrats in San Francisco against
the boss it says the Democratic State Committee has
provided for an appointed State delegation and an
appointed municipal convention.
This argument is the weakest that has ever been in
troduced for the purpose of sustaining tyranny. If
the premises laid down are admitted there is no poli
tical outrage possible of perpetration which may not
be justified. The liberties of the people in the future
may be filched from them upon the theory that they
are being protected from some malign influence which
they are unable to meet and overcome. The argument
is essentially paternal. It rests broadly upon the
proposition that a small body of men know better
what the people want than the people know them
selves.
The organ says that its Republican contemporaries
are too solicitous in this matter. It intimates broadly
that the interest which we are taking in the matter
has a selfish purpose, which is to force a Democratic
primary and throw the party organization into the
hands of the Democratic bosses But the argument
which the organ has produced to sustain this theory
is as weak as the other one just referred to. It pre
supposes that 2000 Democrats led by Boss Rainey
can overwhelm 30,000 Democrats led by Mayor
Phelan and Colonel Sullivan. The absurdity of this
become apparent the moment it is stated.
The principle upon which Republican opposition
to the Democratic oligarchy which is now being
formed reposes ought to be plain even to a newspaper
organ engaged in filching the rights of its party
voters. We do not object to the Democratic party
being run in the manner proposed â it will be the more
easily beaten with McNab. Gould and Alford in complete
charg-e â but we have a right in the interest of all the
people to protest against such political methods.
They arc nnDeniocratic and unAmerican. and in call
ing attention to them, we merely desire to apprise the
great body of the Democratic party of the fact that
they have fallen into the hands of tyrants and must
vote the Republican ticket in order to be free.
THE AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH-
LATE advices from Australia are to the effect
that the plans drawn up by the federal con
vention for the proposed union of the colonies
have been well received, and the prospects are that
the long desired federation will be speedily accom
plished. Even in New South Wales, where the oppo
sition has hitherto been strongest, the sentiment in
favor of union is growing.
In a recent issue the Sydney Herald, after review
ing the policy of the opposition, said: "Either the
foes of federation have no counter scheme which is
not condemned in the mere stating, or, having such,
they prefer to put forward schemes which are at once
seen to be hopelessly impossible. So far as appears,
the sole political ideal of the anti-federalists is a state
of provincial isolation for all time."
The federalists propose that the title of the new
union shall be "The Commonwealth of Australia."
This has a republican sound. Canada calls herself
a dominion. That term is suggestive of royal sov
ereignty. The Australians, in view of the fact that
their union is to be in form at least subject to the
empire of Great Britain, did not venture to assume
the title "republic," but it is clear they mean that, for
the title they have chosen carries the idea by impli
cation.
The difficulties in the way of Australian union have
been due to questions of colonial sovereignty over
lands, rivers, railways and public works. According
to the Sydney Herald these difficulties have been
overcome and all the rights of the colonies have been
carefully safeguarded by the convention. This leaves
the opposition no substantial arguments against the
union, and they are compelled to fight solely for the
preservation of the existing order of things. It is,
therefore, essentially a battle against progress and is
doomed to defeat.
In framing the federal constitution the convention
has borrowed from both the United States and Can
ada. The various colonies arc to take the title
"states," as in this country. The parliament is to con
sist of two houses. Six Senators will represent each
state in the upper chamber, while the lower house
will be modeled after our House of Representatives,
being chosen on the basis of popular representation.
The nominal chief executive will be a Governor-
General appointed by the British sovereign, whose
authority in the commonwealth he will represent, but
the real executive will be a Ministry representing the
federal parliament. In case of a deadlock between
the two houses of parliament, such as sometimes
occurs in this country between the House and the
Senate, or between parliament and the Governor-
General, the constitution provides for a joint assem
bly of both houses which can dispose of the issue in
dispute by a three-fifths vote.
With the adoption of the new constitution Aus
tralia will enter upon a new era in its history, and the
effects of the development of the commonwealth will
sooner or later be felt in the larger politics of the
world. Even at present the Australian colonies are
hardly subject to Great Britain. They regulate their
own commerce without regard to her interests and
maintain over all their affairs a virtual local sov
ereignty.
With the increased power which will inevitably
come from the union there will develop an Australian
patriotism of larger aspirations than the colonists
have known. It is not likely they will desire separa
tion from the empire, for they feel no friction from it
tn disturb their sentiments of loyalty, but they will
certainly insist upon having some voice in imperial
affairs. The establishment of the Commonwealth of
Australia may therefore prove to be a long stride
toward the accomplishment of the much talked of fed
eration of the empire.
If the Grand Jury shall succeed in getting the con
tractors for the Hall of Justice to do the work agreed
upon that body will be embalmed in grateful remem
brance. It will be recalled that this building was to
have been completed last fall, that there was no ex
cuse for delay, that the contractors should have been
fined for their neglect and the contract taken away
from them. Instead of this they were granted an ex
tension of a year. As they are now progressing there
is no doubt that at least ten similar extensions will be
necessary. That the conduct both of Bateman
Brothers and the Supervisors has been outrageous
is a mild statement, and that it affords â  basis for the
jury to work upon there can be no question.
To be sure Wanamaker has got the worst of it
politically, but he has been in a deal in Govern
ment shoes which nets him $70,000 worth of comfort
in this dark hour.
The only trouble with the plan to unfurl over
Morro Castle the largest American flag ever made is
that the castle may not be there at the critical hour.
WITH ENTIRE FRANKNESS.
A gentleman connected with the
Gridley Herald stilll persists that I
have a habit of abusing the country
editor. I must beg the privilege, not
only of saying that he is in error, but
that I wish I were myself a country
editor. Then any city jay who wanted
to poke fun at me could do so and wel
come. If the Herald man thinks that
city newspaper men would accuse him
of lack of ability to use the English
language with excellent effect he cer
tainly has made an underestimate
either of their judgment or of his own
prowess in the matter of words.
Before this article shall reach print
the situation may be changed, but at
the present writing I confess t^ lack of
enthusiasm either as to Sampson or
Schley. They seem to have expended
considerable energy, not to mention
coal and ammunition, in accomplishing
nothing. Cervera is on the wrong side
of the prr/position, and doubtless will
sooner or later be compelled to run up
a white flag or go to the bottom. It
may be remembered that the Maine
went to the bottom, although this is a
forbidden topic by the code erf the
Peace Society. However, while re
fraining from mention of it, I recall it
distinctly, and it serves to ease the
pang which might have been created
by the thought that so clever an ad
miral as Cervera is occupying a pre
carious position between several devils
and an expanse of deep, blue sea. Of
course Cervera will be defeated. He
represents a cause already doomed.
The Americans have the better ships,
the better guns and the better princi
ple for which to fight. But I wish they
might borrow some of the Cervera
cunning.

I observe that the Hamburg-Ameri
can Packet Company has in defense of
itself invaded such proper columns as
those of the Boston Transcript and is
sending copies of that paper, duly blue
penciled, to the public generally.
Doubtless there is virtue in the Ham
burg-American outfit, but the quality
of it displayed in selling ships to Spain
when the purpose was hostile to the
United States does not, even with the
indorsement of the Boston Transcript,
appeal to me as indicating a lofty or,
I may say, decent, state of patriotism.
The line in question has made money
from American patronage. It does not
deserve to make another cent. If any
American contemplating a trip abroad
patronizes this line I will call into
question his standing as a loyal citi
zen. The Hamburg-Americans may
\\<>o and win the approval of all Bos
ton, but out this way the influence of
Boston is not markedly strong. It may
be an authority on beans, but as to de
votion to the flag I prefer a town in
which editorial space is not to be pur
chased.

Last Sunday a number of rich men
were kind enough to let the world know
the fashion by which others may grow
to be like unto them. All through the
articles ran the assumption that every
body desires to be the possessor of a pile
of useless gold. Certainly the money
a man has beyond that he can use, if
not for himself, then for the better
ment of his fellows, represents an ab
solute waste. It stands for care and
futile toil, responsibility, burden. The
greater the hoard grows, the more ap
palling the certainty that in the un
equal division of wealth one instance
of opulence means countless instances
of the pinching of poverty. There is
no scheme by which all may grow rich,
albeit they who by scrimping, or
through what they consider good luck,
have managed to do so, will gravely
lay down a method as infallible. Some
are born without the instinct either of
thrift or of miserliness. They have
not and never can acquire shrewdness.
They are foredoomed to struggle for
bread. There is not in existence enough
wealth to give to each a share. The
astute among us absorb it and then
tell the rest how the trick may be done.
I am not railing at the existence of
great fortunes, but I object to having
people drag out miserable lives in pur
suit of a prize which is seldom to be
attained, and having been reached
brings with it no happiness and only
such distinction as may be embodied
in a lofty headstone, lyingly inscribed.
When a man of fortune, the basis of
which he earned, employs it in the con
struction of factories or transportation
lines or material development, he be
comes to this extent a public benefac
tor. Certainly he is a necessity. With
out him great works would languish,
for it is hard to imagine an ideal state
in which property would be held in
common and administered for the ben
efit of all. Among the gentlemen
quoted, not an individual proclaimed a
rule other than the one laid down by
the farmer to his boy when the lad
had asked how to get rich. "Work
like hell and never spend a cent," the
old man had responded. Such is the
substance of Huntington's remarks. I
cannot think of a reason why a sane
man should aspire to Huntington's
place in the world. He is generally
regarded as unscrupulous, and the hes
itancy about telling him so is not not
able. He says, "Be honest." But
where would he have been now had he
applied this to his own acts? Then
there is C"arnegie. One naturally thinks
of the aerated armor plate he sold the
Government, and turns a deaf ear to
his counsel. As to W. "W. Astor, he
has no business to give advice. His
ordinary indulgences would be the
wildest extravagances to any but a
many-time millionaire. I cannot go
through the whole list, nor indeed is
this necessary. The man who gets
rich, grossly and inexcusably rich, does
not do so by his own efforts. He does
it by getting the benefit of the labor
of others, by preying on the common
necessity. Had Adam secured a sit
uation 6000 years ago at $10 a day,
worked Sundays and holidays and lost
no time, never spending a cent for
hoard, fig leaves, car fare or anything
else, he would now have in bank $21,
900,000, possibly a half of the Hunting
ton accumulation, possibly a quarter
of the amount the pious Rockefeller has
squeezed out of the race. It is to be
regretted that Shakespeare died with
out having left a formula for the writ
ing of plays and that Milton and Ho
mer neglected to bless posterity with
some certain rule by which anybody
competent to grasp a pen could build
deathless poetry by the rod. For it
is just as sensible to suppose that all
of us can be Shakespeares and Miltons
and Homers as that we can study the
methods of the rich, and after the
manner of them heap up treasure. Any

Possibly there was no one so sur

be brief, but result in a complete vin

"When the first regiment of regulars
marched away from San Francisco the
multitudes who turned out to watch
them go noticed a grizzled veteran who
rode at the head of the column. This
was Colonel Evan Miles, the modest
hero of many a battle, a man who had
been thanked by Governors and Con
gressmen because of his courage and
diplomacy which had saved their peo
ple from the marauding Indians, who
fought through the Civil "War and
fought well, and who ever since has
been in the service of his country. The
war with Spain has been in progress,
or rather, has been in existence, more
than a month. In this time other of
ficers have been advanced, nobodies,
and the sons of somebodies have been
taken from civil life, in which they
have been conspicuous failures, and in
vested with title and authority. I re
gret to say that Miles has been over
looked. That he has no pull is evi
dent. If in his heart he has wished
for promotion he has depended upon
his record to secure it, and records do
not seem to count. Perhaps it is not
seemly to find fault with the adminis
tration. I do not doubt that the ad
ministration, like the Texas orchestra,
is doing the best it knows how. But
when it picks up a Russell Harrison,
a Jim Blame or a Fred Grant and puts
straps upon their shoulders, while it
permits Colonel Evan Miles to plod
along unrewarded, I would like to call
it down much harder than it is my
power to do. Perhaps Miles is under
the disadvantage of having the same
name as the head of the army, but to
permit this circumstances to make any
difference would indicate on the part
of General Miles a petty jealousy which
I hesitate to credit him. Surely the
army could stand two Generals Miles
of different grades, as well as two Gen
erals Otis.

The pleasing information reaches me
that Attorney Kowalsky is not happy
over the few brief remarks I made con-
cerning his numerousness on the occa

circumstances correctly, the remarks
were not designed to promote his joy.
Kowalsky undoubtedly has his uses,
but it does not seem to me that the ad
ministration of estates is one of them.
t Just at present there appears to be a
fear that Cervera is on his way to the
Philippine* and that the famous San
tiago bottle is filled mostly with water.
I do not see why there should be any
sensation approaching fear. A gentle
man named Dewey is at the Philippines
and he has a pretty good fleet himself,
good enough certainly to get away with
anything Cervera has under his com
mand. If Cervera try to enter Manila
harbor he will be discouraged at the
initial attempt, and so thoroughly that
if his friends want to give him Chris
tian burial they will first be obliged to

It could reasonably be wished that
those two men of letters, George Alfred

The San Rafael man who tore the

irritation to the race and generally the
direct fault of it. This can be no ex
cuse for the wretch guilty of the cru

serves to be tarred and feathered, tied
to a post and whipped, and then hooted
from the haunts of men. But all this,

Question has been raised as to

ing the circumstances under which it

amending it so as to fit conditions !
which did not at that time exist. The
constitution I take to- be the formu

can change his mind and as great a !
privilege should inhere to the collec

not clear that our forbears knew of a

keep the Philippines. Had they done
so, they might have made provision for
it. I think living men can make bet

than laws never so wise and benign,
made by men who have long been dust. I
If to take the islands seems best, I

The norther which was predicted for

The heat was more exhausting than is
usually the case, as there was 34 per cent

day was recorded by the thermometer,
which showed about 88 degrees.

BEFORE HER HOME
FOUK- YEAR-OLD LOTTIE OLMOS
DIES FROM FIRE.
Her Clothing Became Ignited While
She Was Playing With Matches
on the Street.
While playing with matches Friday
afternoon Lottie Olmos the four-year
old daughter of Samuel Olmos, a shoe
maker living at 433 Vallejo street, in some
way ignited her clothing, and she v.-as so
severely burned thai she died yesterday
afternoon from her injuries and the shock
attending them.
There were a number of children play
ing with the little girl on Vallejo street,
between Montgomery and Kearny, at the
time of the accident, and when they
auded their screams to the agonized
shrieks of the child neighbors were at
tracted to the scene and extinguished the
tiames. The little sufferer was carried to
her home, where Dr. Leland was called
to attend to her injuries. She was badly
burned about the limbs and body and
probably inhaled some of the fire. The
physician relieved the suffering as much
as he could and left her at her home
that night.

"Do you want a drummer?" said S

for his answer.
"A drummer?" said the corporai. quiz
zically. "What would we want a drum*:
rnt-r for?"
"To â to drum," answered the boy.
Tho corporal laughed outright.
"That's so," he said. "I suppose woj
would."
"Oh!" said the boy, drawing a deegi
\ breath, "then I can go."
"Not so fast, not so fast," the corporal
i answered, put his hand on the boy'a
i shoulder and turned him around slowly,
: "I meani we'd want a drummer to drum'
if we wanted a drummer at all. Do you

"Yes," said the boy, quickly. "I can

"I haven't a doubt of it, my boy, but
the fact is there are no more drummers in
the army. The Twenty-third Regiment

The boy stood staring at him. The eager
li^ht faded slowly out of his eyes. It
was a pity to see it go. The corporal gave
his shoulder a lit Ho shake.
"Go home and learn the bugle, lad," he
said kindly.

MONTEREY IS NOW READY TO SAIL
Seventh California

of Colors.
New Brigadiers Take the
Fieldâ Transportation for
lowa Troops.
The story wired from the East yes
terday that Major General Merritt had
telegraphed to the War Department
that he would sail from San Francisco
Sunday has no foundation In fact.
General Merritt has not fixed any date
for sailing, as he does not know when
the fleet of transports will be ready to
sail.
It was ascertained last night that
there had been several conferences on
the subject of holding the Zealandia
and China until three more ships were
ready to join the fleet. Should this plan
be adopted mure organizations than
those already designated will be di
rected to embark. The conflicting ru
mors regarding the dispatch of a Span
ish squadron to the Orient and the un
certainty as to the whereabouts of Cer
vera's ships have cut some figure In
the calculations for the second Manila
expedition. Until within the last
twenty-four hours there has been just
the shadow of doubt in Washington as
to the exact location of Cervera's
squadron. Now that all doubt on this
score is dispelled, orders may come to-
General M^rritt to make all possible
haste to dispatch the second expedi
tion.
General E. L. Otis, the organizer of
the division at Camp Merritt, remark
ed yesterday that further orders re
garding the preparation of troops
would come from the headquarter? of
the Department of the Pacific. The
staff officers of Major General Merritt
were busy enough yesterday and work
ed at headquarters in the Phelan
building until Â«i late hour. The chiel
paymaster announces that all the
troops will be paid before they leave
this port for Manila. As far as can be
rtained, no one in authority at
headquarters expects the fleet to sail
next Tuesday. A day as far distant as
Mom iay, June 13, is given as thr> date
i ( sailing by officers familiar with the
affairs of the quartermaster's depart
ment. In the event of pressing emer
gency or groat peril Merritt could get
two or three ships with troops and sup
plies aboard on the way to Manila
within forty-eight hours. There seems
to be nothing in the situatio-n at pres
ent to demand such haste.
Major Hess will bring four batteries
of the Third United States Artillery to
the Presidio parade plain to-morrow.
Two of the batteries are at present at
Fort Point, one is at Alcatraz Island

they were not designated for that ser
vice by the powers that be. A company

The steamships Ohio and Centennial,

It is said that about 50 per cent of
the men who have applied for enlist

department had engaged transportation
for the Fifty-first lowa Volunteer In

pointment of brigadier-general and was
ordered to report to General Merritt
here. His regiment, which is now sta

It was understood last night In- Ad

of the navy that the Monterey would
leave this harbor to-day on the long
voyage to Manila. It was figured that

INSPECTION OF TROOPS.
Five Thousand Men May Be
Embraced in the Next
Expedition.
Great excitement was caused in Camp
Merritt late yesterday evening by the re
port that five instead of three transports
will compose the next expedition to
Manila, and that 5000 instead of 800 troops
would bo sent. From ofiicers who are in
a position to know it was learned that
such a thing is highly probable. There
are several facts that lend to the rumor
the color of good Â£aith.
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JUNE 5, 1898.
It is known that the expedition will not
he pot ready by that time. A board of
survey from General Otis' headquarters
examined the transports yesterday and
ascertained this fact, which they report
ed to General Otis. The ships, it is
thought, will be in shape to be boarded
by the troops the last of next week.
Yesterday Colonel Hughes and Captain
Mallory Inspected the First Nebraska,
the two Utah Light batteries and the
Utah troop of cavalry. To-morrow the
Thirteenth Minnesota will be inspected at
9 o'clock in the morning and the Seventh
California probably on Tuesday. The in
spections have been excellent, and in
view of this fact and also the probability
that the five Government transports will
}>c completed about the same time, there
is rood reason to believe that the First
Nebraska, Seventh California, Utah
Cavalry, Thirteenth Minnesota and Twen-
tleth Knnsns will be included among the
troops to leave San Francisco this week.
The only doubtful proposition on the
slate, if there be any. is the Utah troop.
It is known positively that General Mer
ritt has discussed with Captain Calne th.
advisability <â : attempting to transport
the horses to Manila. The general does
nol believe th.- animals can make the
trip, and it is eery likely th.- troop will
i..- s.nt as Infantry, as it is said the I nlt
. 1 States government will be unable to
secure the necessary horses in the Philip
pines.
Colonel Hawkins. Tenth Pennsylvania
Regiment, stated that his men would go
on the Zealandla. The stores are now
"yesterday was a day of great suffering
among the officers and soldiers at Camp
Merritt. They were wot prepared for the
sudden heat, which, with their military
duties, made '-amp life exceedingly irk-
Borne. Fortunately there were no sun
strokes nor cases of prostration, but it
was clearly Illustrated from the way the
soldiers were Inconvenienced by the sud
den rise of temperature, that canvas uni
forms will be necessary in the Philippines.
Captain Langfltt, of the engineer corps,
who was ordered to be prepared to sail
on Tuesday, has been formally notified
that his corps will not accompany the
next expedition. The captain will open
up a recruiting station in a few days, as
the corps is about sixty men short.
Lieutenant Alfred Hasbrough Jr.. of the
Fourteenth Infantry, who has been on
detached service in New York, and who
was recently ordered to join his regiment,
reported to Major Robe yesterday.
Lieutenant B. C. Morse, Twenty-third
Infantry, has been detailed by General
Merritt as assistant to the chief of com
missary.
Two cases of measles were reported in
the Twenty-third yesterday, and both
were quarantined.
Colonel Hale, First Colorado, put his
regiment through an extended order drill
anil sham battle yesterday <>n the Pre
sidio grounds. The men of the regiment
were vaccinated yesterday, and also the
soldiers of the two Utah batteries.
Colonel McC. Reeve had his camp thor
oughly watered yesterday. The camp
looked much cleaner and "was certainly
very much cooler than any other.
Captain Young has been notified that he
will be expected to mount one of his guns
upon the forward deck of the ship in
which the batteries sail.

Washington Volunteers
The First and Second battalions of
Washlngton volunteers will be completely
armed and outtltted in a day or two, and
are living la hopes of being sent to the
Philippines this week. They arc drilling
two hours every morning and two hours
every afternoon and are making splendid
progress. Lieutenant-Colonel Fife, com*
branding, Is very proud of his men, and
says they can rnako as good a showing
aa any regiment now here. They are not
raw recruits by any means. They have
been in the National Guard of Washing
ton for years, and were well up in all
that pertains to military drill before com
ing here, and now having been in camp
several weeks they are well disciplined.
They are all anxious to go to the front,
and think it is but just to allow them to
be among the first.
One of the soldiers at Fontana barracks
fainted yesterday while on drill, having
been overcome by the heat.
Private Howard D. Madsen, convicted
of using obscene language to an officer,
has been turned over to the Presidio
officials.
There is only one sick soldier in the
command. He has pneumonia, but was
slightly better yesterday.
COLORSFORTHE SEVENTH
Colonel Berry's Regiment Pre-
sented With a Stand by the
Chamber of Commerce.
Proudly the gallant Seventh California
marched out of Camp Merritt yesterday
morning and over the hills to the Pre
sidio, where it was presented with a mag
nificent stand of colors by George A.
Newhall on behalf of the Chamber of
Commerce. "Very handsome the regiment
looked, the men wearing their new uni
forms for the first time and carrying can-
teens and haversacks -with one ration for
their noonday meal.
Line was formed in column of battal
ions on the slope south of the old camp
Bite of the First California, the band and
field music on the right of the First Bat
talion. At 10:30 o'clock Major-General
Dickinson and staff and Adjutant-Gene
ral Barrett of the National Guard, with
Captain F. de L. Carrington, U. S. A.,
joined Hugh Craig and Mr. Newhall of
the Chamber of Commerce, the entire
party then taking Bt&tlon in front of
Colonel Berry and his staff.
The colors, a beautiful silk American
flag and the regimental colors, a blue
field, on which was embroidered the State
coat-of-arms, were brought up by the
color sergeants, escorted by the senior
company, B, Captain Dodge, and the
hand. Taking the banners and removing
the oilcloth covers Mr. Newhall addressed
Colonel Berry as follows:
Colonel Berry, Officers and Men of the
Seventh California United States Volunteer
Infantry: I can hardly speak when I see be
fore me the flower of our young men from the
southern part of this our glorious State.
Our honored President, Mr. McKlnley, has
called forth the armies of this our country,
and you, my men, I am proud to say, were
among: the first to respond to this call at a
t!mÂ« when our country needed all its sons.
I have been twice honored, first, in being se
lected by the Chamber of Commerce to present
a stand of colon, and second, in being se
lected to present this stand of colors to you,
our well-beloved L,os Angeles regiment.
I am, aÂ» you know, a Los Angeles man my
self in part. My interests are there, my love
of people is there, but in this war we recog
nize no North, no South, no East, no Westâ
we stand together as a unit for right and
liberty. The time has come when California
has shown the other Suite? how soon they can
raise a regiment at thÂ» call of the President.
I will not nay to you, be first In all things,
because I know that every man In this regi
ment goes forth to do his duty regardless of
cost. I will not say to you. think of your
homesi, because when 1 look around Los Ange
les and see it studded with the finest homes In
the State. I am more than over convinced that
(.'ulifornianp are home-lovers. 1 will not say
to you. think of your sweethearts and wives,
because I know that when the band is playing
"The Girl I Left Behind Me" in far Manila,
there will be many thoughts turned towards
the orange groves of Riverside and 'the shady
walks of Pasadena.
But, turning from hearth and home to sterner
things, 1 now hand you these glorious colors.
Keep them sacred: when shot and shell aro
screaming in the air, think, men, of the colors
of your country. Defend them with your last
drop of blood, and when you all come march
ins home wo will be here to receive you bear
ing these colors we now entrust to your keep-
Ing.
Colonel Bern" received fhe colors with
a graceful reply, pledging his own life
and the lives of his officers and men to
their defense.
The colors were then escorted to Com
pany C, Captain Longworthy. the color
company; the battalions wheeled into
column of companies and the regiment
marched in review before the assembled
Officers and citizens.
After this ceremony the Seventh moved
down upon its former camp ground, arms
were stacked, accoutrements unslung and
the men began the prosaic work of polic
ing the spot that had been their home for
two weeks and more. Quickly the straw
and rubbish were gathered up and set on
fire after which the men broke to the
sheltering trees and in the refreshing
Bhade ate their scanty meal. The regi
ment retired to camp Merritt at 2 p. m.
REGULAR ARMY SERVICE.
Numerous Advantages Offered
to Able- Bodied Unmarried
Men of Good Character.
The regular army now offers opportuni
ties for unmarried men. who are earnest
in their purpose, able-bodied, and of good
character, to get a fair start in life by
serving their country for a few years.
The regular army possesses numerous ad
vantages. The term of service is three
years, but men who enlist now can secure
a discharge at the end of the war by mak
ing application. Original enlistments are
confined to persons who are citizens of
the United States or who have made legal
declaration of their intention to become
citizens thereof, and who can speak the
English language. The usual require
ment of being able to read and write
English has been abrogated during the
present war.
In addition to their pay, all regular
army soldiers receive rations, clothing,
bedding, medicines and medical attend
ance free, and during war an increase of
20 per cent over the pay given in time of
peace. The pay of a private is $13 per
month, but during the war 20 per cent
will be added to this, making $15 60 at
least per month while hostilities con-
tlnue.
By care and economy a soldier can save
from his clothing allowance a considera
ble sum, payable to him on his discnarge.
He can deposit his savings in sums of not
less than $o with any paymaster, and for
sums so* deposited for the period of six
months or longer the soldier on his final
discharge will be paid interest at the rate
of 4 per cent per annum. These deposits
are non-forfeitable except for desertion.
Whenever a soldier is honorably dis
charged at the expiration of his enlist
ment or on account of disability not
caused by his own misconduct his travel
pay is ample to carry him back to the
place of enlistment. For an instance, a
soldier discharged In the Philippines, 4000
miles from San Francisco, would receive
one day's pay and one day's commuta
tion (In money) of his rations and cloth
ing for every twenty miles of the dis
tanceâtwenty miles bein~ counted for a
day"s march. Therefore, he would re
ceive pay and commutation for 200 days
from Manila to San Francisco, and the
amount of moneyâ several hundred dol
larsâwould be largely in excess of the
cost of transportation.
In case the soldier decides to remain in
the army after the war he will receive $1
per month increase for the third year of
enlistment. Soldiers re-enlisting within
three months from date of discharge re
ceive a further increase of pay for the |
fourth and fifth years of service, and a
still further increase for each five years
of continuous service. For soldiers who
serve honestly and faithfully for twenty
years or who are discharged for wounds
received or disease incurred in service, a
comfortable home is maintained in the !
city of Washington. After thirty years'
Service enlisted men are entitled to be i
retired, and upon retirement they receive
three-fourths of the monthly pay allowed
by law to them in the grade they hold
when retired and $9 50 per month as com
mutation for clothing and subsistence.
Furthermore, there is at nearly every i
post in the country a library and reading
room, in which is kept a good assortment
of literature. There are also post schools,
where every soldier can acquire, free of
cost, a fair English education, and there
are facilities for gymnastic exercises and
proper games and other amusements.
The purchasing act, by which a soldier
can buy his discharge at the end of his
first year's enlistment upon the payment
of a stipulated sum, $120 being the maxi
mum price, is void during the war. An
enlistment at the present time therefore
means for the war at least and three
years at most. Â
A man to serve in the infantry or artil
lery must be not less than 5 feet 4 inches ,
high, his weight not less than VSi nor
more than 190 pounds; for cavalry, not
less than ."> feet 4 inches nor more than
5 feet 10 inches, weight not more than Ida
pounds. __â
Lieutenant Fisk and Lieutenant W hit
worth have opened a recruiting office for ,
the Eighteenth Infantry in the Examiner
building, Market-street side; Lieutenant
Franklin for the Twenty-third Infantry
in rooms 6 and 7. 23 Kearny street; Lieu
tenant Abernathy for the Third Artillery
in room 229, Phelan building; and Captain
Keefer for the Hospital and Signal corps
at room 219, Phelan building. Recruiting
offices have also been established m all i
the principal cities and towns of the
State. At all the offices numerous appli
cations are being received, and as a rule
the applicants are of a good class of
earnest and determined men. Lieutenant
Abernathy. in the Phelan building, yes
terday received about forty applications
for the Third Artillery. Lieutenant
Franklin at 23 Kearny street, who opened
his office yesterday morning, received
about a dozen applications for the Twenty
third Infantry.
â¢'The regular army has trained officers,
and it therefore stands to reason that the
inon will have the fullest confidence In
them " said Lieutenant Abernathy. it
a man rises in tho regular army he se- j
cures something that he can depend upon.
He is not thrown out at the end of the
war The newspapers to the contrary
notwithstanding, a search of the army
register shows that in the Civil War a
greater proportion, although not greater |
in number, roso from the ranks in the
regular army than from the volunteer |
""The fact that the regular army soldior
is better fed on the same ration than the
volunteer is another thing to be consid
ered The regular army cooks make the
most of the ration, although they may be
no better cooks than those of the volun
teers Private Fox. the cook of Battery
I Third \rtillery, to which 1 belong, has
been in the service fifteen years, and
makes a ration go farther and somehow
taste better than most cooks in civil life
could do. Owing to the superior training
of his supply officer the regular army sol
dier is more sure to g^t his full ration and
all the clothing he is entitled to. Another
thing that may have some weight is that
among the volunteers men become officers
more through their popularity than any
thin" else Of course there are exceptions
to this. In the regular army, however,
men must rise almost entirely on their
merits."
"Although an applicant is not now re
quired to rend and writ" English, but
only to speak the language.' said Lieu
tenant Franklin, "I found during a
month's recruiting in Texas only one man
who could not read and write, and he was
an American born.
"Now as to the pay of soldiers. I have
a man in my office here who draws $21 fiO
a month, and there are a great many in
my regiment who are receiving larger
pay than that. . ._â
"In time of peace a private receives $408
for his three years of service, and if he
is careful he can save nearly every cent
of it In time of war his pay will amount
to much more. So you see a man can. if
he manages correctly, lay by a neat sum
of money."
WILL HAVE ICE IN MANILA
T'nele Sam, one of the very best em- j
ployers on the face of the earth, is de

capacity of 5000 pounds of ice every twen- :
ty-four hours. The specifications provide i
that the Ice must be of the very best

purpose a distilling and purifying appa
ratus is to be provided. With the aid of
this latter apparatus purÂ«-> and whole
some ice is insured, no matter what may
be the quality of th-* water supply. The
plant will furnish the ice in blocks eight

HANLEY'S GREAT FIELDING
ERRORS LOUD AND NUMEROUS
MADE BY BOTH SIDES.
The Game a Great Contest Until
Braves Concentrated Their Fire
in the Fatal Eighth and
Win Out.
BY JOE COR BET T.
A- good sized crowd wandered into
Recreation Park ' yesterday afternoon to
. witness the much heralded game between
the .Fresno "Tigers" and Ban Jose
'.'Lions," familiarly known as McGuck
eft's, "braves." It- was understood be
tweert those 'â (-!<..-=Â«â¢ vp 1 that the' game
was*. to "be fiercely contested, and that the
Fresno "Tigers" were going to surpass
themselves, not any at bat, but in the
field, and that they -were also going to
win the game.' But the most perfect of
. plans sometimes miscarry, and it hap
pened so in the case of the '"Tigers," not,
however, until the last man was out.
'=â¢ Feeling that it' would be an unwise
â¢ move- to- send Pitcher Thomas in to
.work, one Tawney was selected to hold
down that position. The name struck
Manager McGucken as having a suspi
'. Clous ring to it, and he immediately con
fided to his braves on the bench that it
ebunued rather "Spanish." Then touch
ing memories were conjured up, and
Ta-wney became the object of the tire of
these braves, who lit on to him with a
, couple of broadsides in the second inning
that must have made him feel like a real
"Spaniard." Tawney, however, was not
directly responsiole for all the <ianu.se j
done -in this Inning. Moore, Barley and !
McCue, with their rather "loud" errors,
'.were slightly mixed up, and in a way
.were responsible for the bombardment
â which followed.
â¢.' It happened In the usual way. The
â¢pitcher took things easy with the first
.man up, instead of pitching his best to
this same personage, and a base on balls
.was the result. Then started the invasion
.Of Mr. Tawney'S province. The inner;
breastworks, being unable to withstand
the onslaught, gave way. and In conse
quence the cushions were allowed to be t
monopolized without a protest. Then
came a' brave named "Blockers," who
brought his bat to bear on one of Mr. j
Tawney's "visibles," Bending it clear to
the fence, and instantly there began a
proOes'sio-n. When th*- ball finally strug
gled back within the lines three "stal
wart braves" had crossed the plate. It
was .now "Big Chief McGueken's turn,
and. he proved himself equal to the occa
sion by driving out a cracking three-bag
ger and sending in the fourth run.
It appeared after this inning as though
. the "Tigers" were destined to lose, yet
â¢ they rallied, and with well-placed hits
and fast â¢ tinning managed to dupli
cate the feat of McGucken's braves, scor
ing, four runs and going in the lead.
From this on the game was a battle
royal. Errors and base hits were very
conspicuous, yet each team was playing
hard to win, bo what did it matter if a
few errors wore thrown in? To offset them
â¢was the brilliant fielding of Hanly, who,
after some sensational maneuvering, gob
bled up everything that came his way
with a grace that outdid even the move
ments of my "blue ribbon" friends, V hen
"Big Chief McOucken made a fine run
ning catch, which stirred up the crowd,
and is batting was the cleanest Been
here this season. The work of these two
was just brilliant enough to outshine the ,
poor showing of some of the others, and
It was McGucken's hit In the sixth in- i
ning which sent in the two runs that lied
the score. At this stage the thoughts of
tiiat fourteen-innlng game at Fresno
struck one rather forcibly, and when
neither Bide scored in the seventh, 1
thought 1 saw my supper placed in the
ice chest.
I was awakened, however, in the eighth
inning, when the braves reopened on Mr.
'iawney's shoots. This time it was for
keeps. Hanlon led off with a two-base
hit, and then came that hard-hitting
chief again. It was no use trying to fool
him. and evidently Mr, Tawney thought
th* same way. Whether he did or not
makes but. little difference, as the chief
cracked out another safe hit, and al
though thrown out at third trying to
stretch it Into a three-bagger, the win
ning run had crossed the plate, and Me
was the "real tellow " There was very
little to choose between the teams. They
both played the same kind of a game,
and San Jose won. The score:

Merchants and Manufacturers Com
plain Against Unjust Discrim
ination.
At a Joint meeting of representatives
from the Chamber of Commerce, local
Board of Trade, State Board of Trade,
Manufacturers 1 and Producers' Associa
tion, Manufacturers* Boot and Shoe Asso
ciation, Wholesale Grocers' Association
and the Pacific Coast Hardware and
Metal Association the following resolu
tions, which will at once be forwarded to
Washington, were unanimously adopted:
Whereas, San Francisco's geographical posi
tion, its proximity to the Philippine Islands,
Its prominence as a manufacturing; and dis
, tributing center, and ltÃ unquestioned ability,
' with due regard to economy and service, to sup
ply expe3ltlously and thoroughly equip the
Philippine expeditions sent out from this port,
I have been generally conceded; and, whereas,
' despite positive assurance given us by lead
' Ing officials in the War and Quartermaster's
i Departments that all supplies necessary to
' properly equip the troops with headquarters at
1 San Francisco and those ordered to the Phil
â  ippines would be purchased in this market,
conditions of quality, price ami delivery being
equal we are now In possession of evidence
Showing that the Government has unjustly dis
criminated aiainst our shoe factories, in so
far as to permit Eastern manufacturers to bid
for shoes to bo made up, which privilege was
denied us. Further, to our positive knowledge,
shoes were purchased made up In Chicago en
i tirely different from Government sample, to
, fill an emergency order, which shoes could have
been duplicated here had our factories been
permitted to bid upon them; therefore, be it
Resolved, That we emphatically protest
against any discrimination in favor of Eastern
markets especially when the price and quality
Of goods required make clear the fact that .San
Francisco Is the cheaper market; and be It
'"Resolved, That we respectfully urge upon our
representatives in Congress, on behalf of the
allied commercial interests of this city, the
necessity of vigorously and aggressively call
"ng tl- attention of the War and Quarter
master's Departments to the propriety of main
taining a more consistent attitude In the matter
of supplying the Philippine expeditions, as well
as the local needs of all the departments on this
: coast, and at the same time request a more
thorough investigation into the resources and
capacities of this market.

.letr-rmined that Kate C. Byrno was im
poMd upon by S. Ephralm when she is

of February 28, 1894. The note in ques
tion, prior to its maturity, was assigned
to Henry Mohr, and a short time ago he
hrougljt suit to recover the amount of the
ol the instrument and interest. Mrs.
Byrne contested the action with the re
sult that Friday evening a verdict was
rendered in her favor.
Mrs. Hyrne did not deny that she issued
the note, but claimed that she had been
taken advantage of. She stated that S.
Bphraim, In return for the instrument,
promised to deliver her fifty shares of
stock in the Sunset Raisin and Vineyard
Company, which he illemd was of great
v:ilu<j. Mrs. Byrne further testified that
the stock was of no value and that had
â he not i>!;i< >><1 reliance on Kphraim's
statements she would not have issued the
note. Colonel Kowalsky corroborated Mth.
Hyrne's testimony, and the case was
given to the jury. Mnlir is the holder of
another note for $1000 issued by Mrs.
Byrne yt thÂ«> samo time, but just what
action he will t;ike to recover on it is not
as yet known.

THE SAN FBANCTSCO CALL, SUNDAY, JUNE 5 ? 3 898.
THE MEDAL WENT
TO MERRILL'S GUN.
STOCKTON'S BOY AHEAD IN THE
LIVE-BIRD CONTEST.
Rice Handsomely Compensated for
the Loss of the Trophy by Get
ting the Entrance Fees.
Frank Merrill of Stockton carried off
the honors at the State live bird tourna
ment at Ingleside yesterday. It was
the second day of the tournament,
which is being held under the aus
pices of the Olympic Gun Club, and to
day will conclude the event. Merrill is
among the younger members of the shot
gun shooting fraternity, but he has the
advantage of training that began before
he was out of knee breeches. It was the
second event of the occasion in which he
distinguished himself and won the Gold
Dust medal race. This medal has a his
'"iy. dating back Into the existence of
the old California State Sportsmen's As
sociation, now defunct. The trophy, which
!s a beautiful piece of workmanship, is
perpetual, the winner at each tournament
holding the same for one year.
Every time the medal is contested for
the last holder receives the entrance
money of the current match. In IS!M it
was won by J. S. Fanning, and last year
l>y Mr. Rice. Although the latter was
able to hold the trophy yesterday he
was fortunate in having entries that net
ted him the neat sum of $80 prize money.
The conditions, of the match were twenty
live birds, entrance $5, with $15 and $10
fr>r the second and third high guns. Mer
rill killed all of his birds straight, and
he was loudly cheered when he tumbled
his last pigeon. The birds were a fair
lot, but toward the end of the last match
the trapper put a lot of surprises in the
traps, pigeons that did not lose a second
in getting away from the danger line.
This caused a number of those who were
calculating on good things to miss both
barrels, although In the majority of cases
the birds died out of bounds.
The opening event was known as the
California Wing <.'lub ra^-e, ten birds.
Five men made clean scores and divided
the money, as shown by the following
figures:
Feudner, withdrawn: Merrill, 10: Rice, with
drawn; Jacknon, &; Nauman, I; I>'l(?htnn, 9;
Haight, 10; Fox. 10; Ruhstahler, 10; gears, 10;
Wales. 7; Vaufchan, 4; Owens, 8; Klbby, with
drawn; Ingalsbe, withdrawn; Jones, with
drawn.
The second was the big 20-blrd event
mentioned. In which Merrill won the
medal and Otto Feudner took first purse
of $lf) on 19 kills. The third prize of $10
was divided by Haight, Ruhstaller and
Burnett, who killed IS birds. The rec
ords stood:
Feudner, 19: Nauman, withdrawn: Merrill,
20; Ulcp. withdrawn; Ruhstahler, 18: Hears,
flrlth.dra.wn: HaiKht, 18; Jackson, withdrawn;
Ingalstie, withdrawn: 'Jreen, 17; Klbby, with
drawn; Burnett. IK; Taylor, withdrawn; Jones,
17; Vauehan. withdrawn: Hiedelben?, IS.
The Selhy race was the third and last
â¢ eni of the dayâ lo birds, $5 entrance and
J2."> added. The cash was divided among
the six high guns shown in the following
scores:
Frudner, 10; Xauman, 10; Merrill, withdrawn;
Fox, 10; Rice, withdrawn; Halght, H: Bears,
withdrawn; Brighton, withdrawn; Vauphan.
withdrawn: Klbby, 10; Inffalsne, 10; Jones,
Withdrawn; Wales, withdrawn; Burnett. 10;
PpraKue. 9: Jackson, withdrawn; Ruhstahler,
withdrawn.
To-day being the last day of the tour
nament, it is expected that the attend
ance will be larger than on either of the
two preceding occasions. Besides the
cash prizes, the Fay diamond medal will
be contested for, and there are a number
of shots who desire very much to carry
off this beautiful prize.

drifted to that insidious disease known as
looomotor ataxia." A medical man. who
formed one of the party, said th;it sci
ence up to the present time had been nn
nlile to cope successfully with the mal
ady. The best it can do is to afford tem
porary- reiit-f. He characterised It as a
pitiful disease, for the reason that while
the upper part of the body might be in
perfect physical condition the one afflict
ed loses almost entire control of the Umbf
and locomotion becomes a most painful
effort, and, concluded the doctor. "I re
ally believe that T would prefer to be
afflicted with almost any other disease
than 'locomotor ataxia'."
At this Juncture a little old man of the
group, who had been an Interested listen
er to the dissertation, and who was par
tially deaf, remarked: "Well I must say
that when a 'locomotive attacks you." you
don't have much of a chanc for your life.
In many cases when you come In contact
with the 'steam horse' you not only lose
control of your limbs, but you lose them
outright. We have a little railroad duwn
In our section and the one locomotive in
up<> has done all kinds of damage. Why
It killed three men in a week, and cattle
In great numbers are found strewn along
thfi road. aJter they had been tossed in
the air by the 'little demon,' as it has
come to be culled; and a singular thing
about it all is that their limbs are in
variably cut off by the in. pact. I quite
agree with our friend, the doctor, that
nothing has such bad results aa when a
'locomotive attacks you."

Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, June 4.â The advance
guard of French scientists who intend
to build a balloon here and start on a
search for Andree arrived yesterday
and are now perfecting arrangements
for the perilous trip. They are Dr. A.
J. Terwagne, Edouard Feret and I,<r\iis
Nicolas, all of Paris. M. Varicle ia ex
pected to arrive in a few days.
Terwagne is a personal friend of An
drÂ»*e. rie said the party would get away
from here in about three weeks, would
proceed to either Skaguay or Dyea and
make the balkron trip across Alaska,
Btopping at out of the way places in
search of the famous explorer, who, he
firmly believes, is alive and well. The
doctor does not expect to experience
many difficulties on the trip.
"Our principle," said he, "is to get
the balloon up a certain distance and
regulate it at will. We have a hemp
rtrpe 150 yards long, with ;<o yards in
balloon. This trails along the ground,
and we can guide our movements per
fectly. Andree failed on account uf his
poor rope arrangement. When leaving
Spitsbergen the ropes were inter
twined and he had to leave go of two,
thus sending the balloon to a great
height and making it unmanageable.
He intended going north, but when he
lost the ropes the balloon became un
manageable and drifted away in the
opposite direction. We are convinced
Andree is in Alaska, If we thought he
was in Siberia we would never search
for him. as he would be dead by now."
By his rope system Dr. Tnt-wagne
traveled with Andree from Paris to
Dieppe recently.
"NOTES 'ON THE
PHILIPPINE ISLANDS
Interesting Information Concerning
Gold on Luzon and Conditions
as to Climate.
WASHINGTON, June 4.â "Notes on
the Philippine Islands" have been is
sued by the State Department as No.
131 nf the advance sheets of the con
sular reports.
One expert extensively quoted, Frank
('aruth, says that extensive gold de
posits have been opened up quite near
th^ sea, assuring; a large output fur
many years to come. It has also been
proved that they extend over a wide
district. Alluvial pold is found in the
island of Mindanao, and there are Â»jx
tenslve cupper deposits in Luzon. While
no true coal has been found. there is
ligriitt- of a very good quality, quite
useful for Bteam vessels. This is in
Rreat quantity. Roughly washed al
luvial gold has been found to contain
rubies and hyacinths. There is no
want of labor ;it cheap rate, and ,on
the whole, the general conditions for
mining are exceptionally favorable.
Some facts of Interest, aside from
mining, ar-- noted. For Instance, the
Philippine archipelago contains nearly
two thousand Islands. Two of them
are larger than Ireland. Luzon, with
42,000, and Mindanao with 35.000 square
miles. Earthquakes are not infrequent.
The rainfall is not excessive, nor is it
continuous.
The climate is very healthy for a
tropical region, and diseases such as
yellow fever are unknown. The na
tives are mostly Malays, but in the In
terior are remnant? of a rare of Pap
uan origin.
The author of the pamphlet speaks
in the highest terms of the character
of the natives. Th^ family tie is very
Strong, children are orderly, parents re
spected and the race has an inbred
courtesy and prudence, while ready
hospitality is never missing. Eight mil
lion natives inhabit the Philippines,
food resources are ample and famine is
unknown.

OUTCOME OF A SCANDAL
UPROAR AT THE ORPHANAGE
INVESTIGATION.
Commissioner Pratt Resigns, Claim
ing His Fellow Officials are
Not Disposed to Deal
Justly.
Sp*>clal Dispatch to The Call.
CARSON. June 4.â The Investigation
of the Orphans' Home scandal closed
this afternoon at 3 o'clock and the af
fair was taken under advisement by
Commissioners Cutting and Wester
field. Commissioner Pratt resigned
this morning, claiming he could get no
justice from the board.
At last night's sessiirn there was an
exciting scene. The board got into a
wrangle, and the attorneys for Day,
the accuser of the Orphans' Home
managers, left the room in disgust.
Attorney Woodburn returned, however,
and at a remark of Commissioner Cut
ting a light began between the two. A.
Stock, bruther of Miss Stock, and State
Printer McCarthy drew their revolvers,
but shooting was prevented by a rush
of ladies. But again weapons were
drawn, this time by a number of per
sons on both sides. A tragedy was
averted by the police officers who had
been called into attendance, as trouble
was feared.
The case against Stock brothers, for
whom "warrants were issued last night,
for drawing deadly weapons, will be
withdrawn, as the complaining' wit
nesses, State Printer McCarty and
Charles B. Day, also drew revolvers,
and they have been advised by their
friends to let the affair drop.
The board will exonerate Miss Stock
of the charges that have been filed
against her character.
The attitude of Commissioner Cut
ting in the case has been seriously com
mented upon. That gentleman is a
brother-in-law of Superintendent Bee
be, and during the session acted as his
defender, notwithstanding he was sup
posed to be an impartial Judge. He
frequently scoffed at answers given by
witnesses for the prosecution and ad
mitted in open session that his mind
was made up.

"I suspect that I may attribute my recent headaches to
doing so much night-work of late," said a lady who earns her
own living. " I had an order to address a large number of en-
velopes and as I was paid by the thousand and others wanted
the work, too, I sat up pretty late and perhaps worked in a room
not so well ventilated as it might be. As a consequence I have
more than once had a headache the next day. I have found,
however, that if I swallow a Ripans Tabule just as soon as I
have a premonition of the trouble, it staves it off and I escape
scot free. That is why I say that Ripans Tabules are a medicine
. for well people, for I am certainly a healthy woman, but I use the
Tabules now and then and would not like to be without them." ,

HOW. THE TIDE WAS TURNED
CLANCY TELLS OF EARLY TALK
AGAINST HIM.
the Call's Special Correspondent
Shows How Ireland, as a Na
tion, Heartily Sympathizes
With America.
BY J. J. CLANCY.
LdNDON, May 21.â The death of Mr.
Gladstone i? the great topic of the hour.
The; newspapers are full of it; so Is
â  ewry place of public resort, an<l s*>>, of
: ipedally are the Houses of
Parliament Tlie tact that it had been
â¢ â¢ expect p.i for mo'kp has not tended to
diminish the general Interest and Bym
â  patjify. Every one seems to feel and to
y ailmft that in Mr. Cladstone there hafl
; passed; away the greatest man of the
Irtish rare whom this century has
tuced ami one of the greatest men
â â¢?" that race <>f any time. He is now !
I'ra.isc'l as pre-eminently a Christian
. statesman, a politician of lofty Ideals,
.a man of principle, a patriot who has'
done unrivaled service to his country:
and" in tl'.is eulogy those \%ho were his
political opponents .I"in with his politi-
Uowers, Yet n Is only a tew years
-since he was the constant butt of the
hatred, the Indignation, the denuncia
tion, and even the scoffs and ridicul<
.fully half of tl of England. I
> self have a k< en remembrance of the
'â treatment he habitually received at the
hands of the Tory party in the House j
.Commons during the home rule
.struggle. He often seemed to me to be
rded by them at incapable of tell
the truth. Hut the English do not,
rule, keep up political animosities
ause "f them has |
y, and when Mr. Gladstone retired
politl Â» even the bitterest among
British opponents at once began to
gnjse hie greatness and the luster
*. be Bh< d on their common coun-
â¢ Yesterday, as my readers will long
â¢ â¢ since have learned by cable, was given
up by both Houses of the British Par
liament to eulogies of the deceased
'â¢. statesman! In the House of Lords the
mos.t notable incident of the sitting was
the intervention of Lord Rosebery. He
spoke "as the last successor in office
.'of Mr. Gladstone." and made by far
the most impressive speech of any de
livered. He had not spoken in the
House of Lords for a considerable time,
and there are certainly several circum
stances which made it natural for him
I? to-be on such an occasion among the
panegyrists. He was one of the most
intimate of the personal friends of Mr.
Gladstone; in latter years he was his
â¢ . favorite Foreign Minister, and he was
, more than once clearly pointed to by
his leader as his natural successor in
the leadership of the Liberal party,
though, curiously enough, it was an
â  Utterance of Mr. Gladstone on the sub
ject of the Turkish atrocities in Ar
menia which finally and directly led to
his retirement from that post a couple
> of years ago. It was natural and most
; , appropriate, therefore, that Lord Rose
bery should speak on this occasion;
j nevertheless, some persons seem to see
in the incident something beyond a
mere desire on the part of the speaker
to pay a tribute to his deceased leader,
and regard it as a political demonstra
tion and a bid for a renewed leader
ship. I confess I do not myself take
thia I lew of it, but at the same time
, there can be no question that Lord
Rosebery's action and speech yesterday
day are highly calculated to accelerate
the movement, which, undoubtedly, is
already on foot for bringing him back
to the position in the Liberal party
whjeh he abandoned under the circum
â .'â stances to which I have alluded.
.- In the House of Commons the absence
Â«fthe Parnellites during the delivery
â  of-, the speeches on Mr. Gladstone was,
V; of course, generally noted. It was
; ;, deliberate and has. been explained by
â¢â¢Mr. John Redmond himself, the leader
of the party, to a representative of the
press. Mr. Redmond and his colleagues
. â admit, like every one else, the Intel
: â¢ le.ctual greatness of Mr. Gladstone, his j
..â¢ marvelous oratorical gifts, and the
magnitude of the services which he j
" '.â¢ rendered to his own country. But they
know that there is another side to the '
picture; that Mr. Gladstone's relations i
.' . with Ireland were not always fruitful
in blessings, and that it was he who
\ directly led to the crisis in the fortunes
, â  of the Irish National party in Parlia
fi ment in 1890, from which results so
disastrous, from the Irish Nationalist
point of view, have since followed. They
. â¢ did not, however, wish on such an oc
.. casion to mar the general harmony of
giving expression to those views in the
. .House; they did not, on the other hand,
Bee that they could well remain silent
if statements were made in their pres
ence, on those points, with which they
could not agree; and therefore, they
. decided to be absent altogether. They
are, of course, blamed by their oppon
."â¢ ents in Ireland; but their course has
â¢' "been approved, so far as I can see, by
.â¢ at least their own supporters, and I do
not find it condemned in England.
â " ' The death of Mr. Gladstone has tem
porarily displaced the war from its
position in the public mind; but there
is one topic connected with it which
has continued to excite considerable
attention in Ireland. Last week, as
, will be remembered, Mr. Chamber
- lain, the Colonial Secretary, made a
rather" sensational speech in which he
â  pictured war between England and one
or more of the European powers as a
possibility of the near future, and not
indirectly pleaded for an alliance be
1 tween England and the United States.
There can be no question that, if such
an alliance could be struck up, every
Englishman would rejoice, and so
would those In Ireland who are English
in sentiment. But the great majority
â¢of th" Irish people would certainly
view such ~-n alliance with no friend
ly feelings, and largely because they
... believe that it would be, as far as
" America, is concerned, a kind of Glaucus
â¢ bargain. On this . point Mr. Michael
. Davitt, M. P., has written this week
a letter to the mes here, in which he
points out that America would abso
lutely have nothing to gain from such
.' an alliance while England would have
everything; and he Insists that there
are enough Irishmen and men of Irish
birth in the United States to prevent
â¢â¢ such an alliance being formed. Another
incident in this connection remains to
be mentioned. At present arrange
ments are in progress for a dinner in
Â» London on the 3d of June to promote
" the movement 'or an Anglo-American
â alliance, and among other persona in
* vited to take part in the proceedings
has been Mr. William Redmond. M. P.
for Clare, brother to the Parnellite
leader. Mr. Redmond has flatly re
fused the invitation on the ground that
he does not believe in the proposed
alliance; and he adds that he does not
believe in the sincerity of those Eng
lishmen who nrofess sympathy with
America or in the national character of
the present movement.
The members of the committee which
is organizing the proposed dinner are
certainly not representative. The chief
of them are James Bryce, M. P., the
author of the well-known book on th<'
American constitution, and Sir Charles
Dilke, M. P., and it cannot be said that
either the cne or the other is represen
tative of England or a man in the front
rank of British politicians. Sir George
Baden-Powell, M. P., is the only Tory
on the committee; Horace Plunkett,
M. P., is the only Irishman who has at
tached himself to it; and, of course,
neither equals either Mr. Bryce or Sir
Charles Dilke in political reputation or
in influence.
A few days ago the British, but still
more the Irish, public were amuse! at
finding in the daily papers a telegram
addressed to the Spanish Bmb&ssador
in London in the following t.rms: "God
save Spain and King Alfonso XIII. D.
McAleese, M. P.. J. Hammond, M. P."
Those two gentlemen are members of
the anti-Parnellite party in the House
of Commons; one sits fur a division of
the County Monaghan, the other for
the county of Carlow. Both are quiet,
respectable, silent men: the former, at
least, though silent, is an able man and
could talk if he liked. The last thing
one would expect from either of them
would be the adoption of such a means
.if manifesting their opinions. Without
wishing in th^> least degree to dispar
age their influence, T may truly say
that their joint telegram of congratu
lation on the anniversary of the birth
day of the Spanish monarch has only
provoked a smile even among the mem
bers of the party to which they them
selves belong. Certainly they do not
express general opinion in manifesting
sympathy with Spain in the matter of
this war. What I have already written
.m this subject in previous letters I ad
here to still: No doubt there are sym
pathizers with Spain in Ireland as there
are, I suppose, in every country; but
there can be no doubt at all as to which
way the preponderating sentiment
tends. Ireland, as a nation, and speak
ing broadly, is heartily with America.

SALINAS, June 4.â Fire was started in
some brush near Tulareftos ranch, a few

owing to the carelessness of watchers,
spread beyond control. It soon attacked

this afternoon had extended over a tract
three miles wide and twelve in length,
destroying trees and standing: grain and
doing considerable other damage. A dense*
cloud of smoke hangs over Salinas, and
to-night the sky is lurid. The loss will
be great, and it is impossible to give any
estimate, as the flames are still spread
ing. The scene from the dome of the
court house is one of grandeur, the
flames leaping high into the air and light
ing up the surrounding country.

RIOT RAMPANT
IN THE ORIENT
Robber Bands Overrun
China.
FORMOSA REVOLT SPREADS
ALLEGED MASSACRE ON THE
ISLAND.
Japanese Soldiers Said to Have Ruth
lessly Murdered Men,
Women and
Children.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TAOOMA. June 4.â The steamship
I Victoria, arriving this evening, brings
â  Hongkong advices to May 12. The spirit
| of rebellion and riot seems to pervade
i many parts of the Orient. Five thou
| sand robbers are assembled in one band
I in the mountains of Loyang, Kinehow
! district, near Canton. Three thousand
are natives of that district and the bal
ance comprise groups of marauders
I from other places. They commit crimes
| of every description, plundering, rob
â  bing and killing as their fancy die-
I tates. The local officers are terrorized
i and dare not cope with them.
Recently the house of an influential
mandarin was robbed, and the robbers,
who met no resistance, were able to do
as they liked. The mandarin was very
angry and offered rewards of $20 for
the capture of each robber. Seven rob
bers were caught, but the mandarin
then refused to give the reward. The
dishonesty of the mandarin has made
the robbers bolder and more cruel than
ever, for all poor people have made up
their minds not to interfere with their
plunderings, because they know the
rich cannot be trusted. The Canton
authorities have offered rewards for
the capture of men known to be sup
plying arms and ammunition to the
robbers.
On April 26 a small band of brigands
attacked the yamen of the magistrate
of Kuming. They carried away val
uables worth $10,000, and released the
prisoners confined in the yamen.
Four Chinese mariners were fatally
burned by an explosion aboard a small
Chinese gunboat, which was practical
ly blown up. The gunboat was near
Wuchow, bound from Nanking to Can
ton with pay for the Cantonese troops.
â¢ (lining to a locality infested by pi
rates, the captain ordered his men to
load all the guns in readiness for an
attack, at the same time cautioning
them not to smoke opium near the pow
der magazines. This warning was dis
regarded, and the result was an ex
plosion of the magazines, by which all
the guns were discharged simulta
neously. The captain succeeded in
rescuing three wounded men who
Jumped into the river. Another was
drowned. The hull of the gunboat was
badly damaged.
The rebellion in Formosa has been
confined largely to the central and
northern parts r* the island. Now an
uprising is expected in the southern
end. according to a correspondent for
the Hongkong Press, who writes that
the feelings of the populace there have
been wrought to the boiling point by
the butchery of innocent countrymen
and helpless women and children by
Japanese soldiery in the Hozan district.
A company of Japanese soldiers fol
lowed a band <>f Formosan robbers to
their lair in the hills twelve miles from
Hozan. but the robbers escaped by
means of a secret exit from a big cave
in which they took refuge, after firing
into the soldiers and killing several.
Maddened by defeat, the Japanese are
said to have vented their spite and
thirst for blood upon the peaceful vil
lage of Loonahtieng, several miles dis
tant. It is alleged they set the vil
lage on fire at night, and when the
villagers rushed out they were shot
down by a cordon of troops surround
ing the town. Twenty-four men, two
women and four children are known to
have been killed. Only a half-dozen
houses remain of over two hundred
which formed the village.
Three thousand black flag soldiers
arrived at Wuchow on May 5 in con
sequence of a dispute between a soldier
and a Chinese employe of the Chinese i
imperial maritime customs. These sol- I
di^rs hate customs officers. Turning
themselves into a mob they attacked
the custom-house and were driven back
by the prefect's soldiers. The soldiers
belong to an anti-foreign secret soci
ety. Much alarm prevails at Wuchow
over the reports that all foreigners
there are to be massacred.
Suisun Child Drowned.
STTST'N, June 4.â Henry, the 7-year-oin
, son of Mr. and Mrs. James Crowley. met
death to-day by drowning. In company
with two boys of about the same age the
child had gone to the Pierce wharf. The
little fellow got into a boat and was >pft
i there fishing by his two companions. I~ur
ing their absence of about 10 minutes he
fell overboard. TJie body was soon after-
I ward recovered by a workman.

INSTEAD OF GOING TO
A REAL, ESTATE OFFICE
â¢ To look over a list of houses for rent
stop a moment, and think to what ex- !
travagances that will lead you. You i
who are economical in ether directions, j
just consider for a moment how extrava- i
bant it in to persist in throwing money j
away month after month, year after year, j
Just to satisfy yourself ask any old j
renter what he has to show for years of j
such a fcoli.sh prartlceâ for dollars upon I
dollars spentâ and he'll show you
every tinif; ami thus, having satis.T:d your- j
sell that there is nothing in favor of rent* !
fng, of giving up hard-earned money for j
no equivalent, you ought to be ready to
do as the folks in the Heyman Tract have
doneâ own a home of your own, paying
for it with monthly payments, the same
amount as your rent money. About 100 j
people have already been supplied with '
homes on this plan â why not be No. 101? j
This near-by tract, with its cozy homes, !
can be reached by taking Mlssion-st. cars, ]
transferring to Twenty-second st. to '
Huffman aye.; ask for Mr. James Cotter, i
resilient agent, who will show you around

Works at half-past 10 o'clock.
.rawny men with sledgehammers
kept knocking away the shore dogs until
nothing remained to hold her in place
save the jackscrew which was propped
against her stern and a few wedges un
der her keel. At this time Mrs. Gerstle,
with her husband standing beside her,
ungloved her right hand and seized the
champagne bottle which swung from the
port bow suspended by a blue ribbon with
the vessel's name anu the date Oi her
launching painted in letters of gold upon
it. Then one mighty blow from the work
man's sledgehammer dashed aside the
last obstruction and the vessel commenc
ed to move toward the waters of the bay.
Then it was that Mrs. Gerstle swung the
bottle and in a clear voice said, "I chris
ten thee Sadie."
A cheer from those present, with the
shrill whistles from the workshops
greeted the last mechanical production
from the Union Iron Works' shops.
The new vessel is intended for the
Alaska service, and will be engaged in
towing barges from St. Michael to the
Yukon River, and if necessary will go up
the Yukon as far as her draught will
permit.
Her dimensions are: Length on water
line 150 feet, length over all 157 feet 6
inches, beam 30 feet, depth of hold 8 feet
6 inches, gross tonnage 252. speed 11 knots,
horsepower 300, draft "6 inches.
Work was commenced on her by the
Union Iron Works on the last week in
March, and without any rush she
reached her finishing touches a few weeks
ago, but her launching was delayed for a
full tide and a joyful moon, both of
which, with an exceptionally tine sum
mer night, saluted her as she kissed the
waters of San Francisco Bay.

WAR REVENUE
BILL PASSED
But It Must Now Go to
Conference.
BOND PROVISIONS REMAIN.
SEVERAL IMPORTANT AMEND
MENTS GO THROUGH.
One Places a Duty of Ten Cents a
Pound on All Tea Imported
Into This Country.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, June 4.
The war revenue measure was passed
by the Senate this evening at 7:05
o'clock. The bill was under consid
eration eight hours to-day. A score
or more attempts were made to amend
it, but in only three or four instances
were the attempts successful. Par
ticular effort was made to amend the
bond provision of the measure, but it
was futile In every instance.
The most notable amendment made
to the measure to-day was that offered
by Tillman of South Carolina, placing
a duty of 10 cents a pound on all tea
imported into the United States. The
amendment created no debate and was
adopted by c. vote of 38 to 32. It is
calculated by the Senate experts that
the duty, if it be finally enacted into
law, will raise at least $10,000,000 a year,
and probably more. An amendment
offered by Chilton (D.) of Texas, a
member of the Finance Committee, pro
vides for a tax, graduated according to
price, upon all articles sold under a pat
ent right, trade mark or name not open
to general use and which are not other
wise taxed by the bill.
Through an amendment offered by
L,indsay (D.) of Kentucky the Senate
decided not to place a stamp tax upon
bundles of newspapers, wholly or partly
printed, which weigh less' than 100
pounds.
A tax of 4 cents a barrel was placed
on adulterated (lour ami a stamp tax
of 1 cent on every ticket entitling the
holder to a seat in a palace or parlor
car or berth in a sleeping car, the com
pany selling the seat or berth being re
quired to affix the stamp.
On the passage of the measure every
Republican voted in the affirmative. Hy
parties the vote in favor of the meas
ure was: Republicans, 39; Democrats,
7; Populists 1; Silver Republican. I;
total, 48. Against the bill: Democrats,
20; Populists. 7: Silver Republican 1:
total, 28. The Democrats who voted
for the bill were Caffery, Gorman,
Lindsay. McEnery, Mitchell, Murphy
and Turpie. The Populist was Kyle
and the Silver Republican Mantle.
After the transaction of brief routine
business the Senate resumed considera
tion of the war revenue measure. As
no amendment was pending Allison sug
gested the bill ue reported from the com
mittee of the whole to the Senate.
The suggestion developed several
amendments, and also the absence of a
quorum. Mason, who said he had an
Important amendment, demanded a cail
of tne Senate.
After a delay of fifteen minutes a
quorum was secured.
->iorgan iD.i of Alabama then offered
the amendment of which he grave notice
yesterday, requiring the Secretary of tie
Treasury to proceed with the collection
of the taxes under the provisions of tlfe
income tax law of 1&94. not directly re
pealed by the Dingley bill. If the Secre
tary of the Treasury should refuse to
levy the taxes under the law the amend
ment provides that it shall be the duty <.f
the Attorney General to proceed against
the Secretary of the Treasury to compel
him to perform the duties, and if the At
torney General should r< :":ipc to ta ;o th?t
action, any taxpayer of the United States
may bring tli" necessary action to compel
tli<- enforcement of the law.
Morgan said that full opportunity w.v?
presented by bis amendment to have the
question which it involves settled by the
Supreme Court, for. quite naturally, ai
firmative action taken by Congress on the
subjeel would relegate the entire subject
t>> the Department Court. Congress could
scarcely refuse, Morgan thought, t , pro
vide for another test of the income tax
question, in view of the fact that v Â«:is
forced to Increase taxation and to bor
row money in order to prosecute the i res
ent war.
With the conclusion of his speech Mor
gan asked for an aye and no vote upon
his amendment. The amendment was re
jected by 35 to "S, as follows:
Ayeeâ Allen, Ba<-on. Bate, Berry. Butler.
Cannon. Chilton. Clay. Cockrell, Daniel. Faulk

The Senate adopted nn amendment to
the war revenue bill providing for a tax
of 1 cent on every berth in a sleeping- car
and every seat in a palace car sold, as a
substitute for White's amendment. levy-
Ing a tax of a fourth of 1 per cent on the
gross receipts of sleeping- car companies.
Turley (D.Â» of Tennessee offered an
amendment levying an excise tax of a
fourth of 1 per cut upon the gross n -
ceipts of transportation firms, companies
or corporations doing an interstate busi
ness or a business between a State and a
foreign country. The amendment also
placed the same excise tax upon telegraph
and telephonecompaniessendlng messages
from one State or Territory to another.
The amendment was rejected by 24 to 3S.
Mills (D.) of Texas proposed this amend
ment:
That on nnd after thÂ» 30th day of June, IS9S.
and until the Wth day of June, 1900. in lieu of
the duties now Imposed by law on the dutiable
articles imported from foreign countries there
shall be levied, collected and paid on such
dutiable articlf-s 75 per cent of several duties
and rates of duty now imposed by law upon
said ;irticlps severally, it being the intent of
this section to reduce existing duties on said
articles 2.". p?r cent of such duties.
The vote on the amendment resulted:
Ayes 25, noes 41.
Mason called up his amendment provid
ing for a tax of 4 cents per barrel on ad
ulterated flour, and made a vigorous ap
peal: for its Incorporation in the bill. The
amendment was agreed â 11 to 29.
It requires packages containing mixed
flour to be labeled as oleomargarine. The
tax is to be represented by coupon
stamps, and the provisions regarding to
bacco, stamps are made applicable to
these stamps. .
Pettigrew offered an amendment repeal
ing the law of 1895, authorizing the Sec
retary of the Treasury to issue bonds
without direct authority from Congress.
By an aye and no vote" the: amendment
was rejectedâ 43 to 31.
Allen (Pop.): of Nebraska offered an I
amendment providing- that no bonds or !
certificates of. indebtedness be issued un
der the proposed act should be used as ;{
basis for National Bank circulation; and
that the Secretary of the Treasury. should
not. have, authority to issue bonds to in
crease the gold : reserve for ' any purpose
without direction of Congress. The
amendment was rejected â 27.. to 42.
Chilton (D.) of Texas offered an amend
ment Â«placing a stamp tax. -graduated in
accordance with the price, upon "articles,
substances, preparations or compounds
except- for the products and preparations
otherwise provided for in this act that are
made and sold or removed for sale under
patent right; trade marks , or . any, name
or designation not open to general use." r ".
* The tax \ ranges from = one-fourth of : a
cent ;on 5 > cent | articles to our .: cents on a
dollar package, and 2 cents: additional on
every 50 cents or fractional \ part ' thereof
over $1. The amendment was agreed to â
41 to 31.
Lindsay (D.) of Kentucky offered an
amendment providing that no stamp tax
shall be placed on packages of news
papers wholly or partly printed, which
weigh less than 100 pounds
In the course of a discussion of the !
question Allen, Woloott and Aldrich en- ,
tered into the matter of taxing news- !
papers. Alien maintained the tax would i
operate as a hardship upon the country i
preys.
Wolcott held that the .postal facilities I
of the Government were open to all news- !
papers and it was a fact, he said that
the country press did employ the postal i
facilities to the exclusion of the express
companies. The express companies were
used, he said, by the great newspapers i
of the country for the reason that they
could gain time in the delivery of the !
papers to their subscribers. One of the |
most efjuitabie taxes thai could be levied. :
said he, would be a tax on newspaper i
circulations, and the Government would i
have only to accept the newspapers' own !
figures as to circulation to raise a reve- I
nue of $100,000,000 a year.
Considerable time was consumed in dts- â¢
cussing the amendment, which was firvilly
agreed to. 47â20.

grew levying a iax..i a half per cent upon
the value of all articles manufactured by
a trust. The amendment was rejected â
45 to 24.
The bill, which had been considered in
the committee of the whole, was then re
ported to the Senate.
Jn the Senate those amendments which
had been agreed to were adopted.
Jones of Arkansas proposed to amend
the bond provision of the bill by striking
out the words, "after ten years from the
date of their issup," thus making the re
demption of the bonds optional with the
Government within twenty years. The
amendment was defeated, 31 to 42.
An effort was made by Jones of Arkan
sas to make the bonds payable at any
tinif after throe years, at the option of
the Government; but lhat, too, was de
feated, 31 to 42.

ings system In lieu of the bond provision
of the* bill. The amendment was rejected
without division.
In lieu of the bond provision, Stewart
offered a provision for the issue of treas
ury notes to the amount of $400,000,000, re
ceivable for Government dues. On motion
of Allen, the amendment was laid on the
table, 54 to 18.
Ttrrpie CD.) of Indiana proposed as a
substitute for the bond provision a prop
osition to Issue $150*000,000 of treasury
notes nf denominations of $5, $10 and $20
and $60, or multiples thereof, the notes to
be redeemable in one year and payable in
three years from date of issue to bear 2
per rent interest, to be good for public
dues and to be used by the Government in
payment of war expenses. The amend
ment was rejected, 28 10 45.

and rejected. As finally completed, the
bill was placed upon its pa^sa^e. It was

HOW POLITICS FIGURED
MAY CRITICISE THE DOINGS OF
TOWNSHIP JUSTICES.
Some Surprise That the Indictment
of Harry Thomas Should
Be Quashed so
Quickly.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, June 4.
The Grand Jury, of which so much was
expected, will sooji Issue its report, which
will undoubtedly show that it has not ac
complished much more than some of its
predecessors. It is one of the most rep
; resentative grand juries that has ever
been empaneled, but there is no doubt
that its deliberations and Investigations
have been considerably hampered by the
influence of politics. Many scandals
known to exist have been probed by this
body persistently and energetically, but
the evidence placed before them has
! amounted to very little but gossip.
The investigation of the water rate
business, of the tales of bribery at the
: City Hall and of other municipal scan
dals brought these matters prominently
before the public, and in this way, per
i haps, some good has been obtained. But
the guilty ones are in no more danger of
! being punished for their misdeeds than
i they were before the jury convene.!.
Some of the grand Jurors are very dis
appointed at the outcome of the trial of
Harry Thomas. They took testimony
clearly establishing the fact that through
the Influence of young Thomas Robert
McKtnzie was induced to give false testi
mony before the Grand Jury. They
authorized the issuance of the indict
ment, and were very disappointed to find
that the matter with which Harry
Thomas was alleged to have been con
n< rit d was not under investigation by
them in any legal sense. For the past
couple of weeks the grand jurors have
been engaged in going over the finances
of the county. The expert. Denshee, has
spent several weeks In the Offices of the
Justices of the Peace, and probably the
Jury may have some recommendations to
make in this regard. The report of the
County Clerk, just issued, showing the
amounts paid to Justices and constables,
especially the enormous charges for mile
age, has received the attention of the
grand jurors. But as these charges are
all declared to he in conformity with the
law the Grand Jury cannot accomplish
any reform.
It is expected that the report will be
ready some time next week and that the
jury will be discharged.
THEY WILL SCALP
MR. VAN BOKKELEN
DIOCESAN TREASURER HAS
MADE ENEMIES.
Rev. Marshall Law and Other Clergy
Object to Being "Rounded Up"
by an Offensive Official.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, June 4.
When the diocesan convention of the
Episcopal church meets in San Fran
cisco, a determined effort will be made to
secure the ousting of Treasurer Van Bok-
I kolen. Already some theological politics
Is being done, which has for Its pur
pose the removal of the official who has
i made himself obnoxious to several clergy
men in Bishop Nichols' diocese.
The opposition to Mr. Van Bokkelen la
being led by Rev. Marshall V. Law of
. East Oakland, who has figured In many
sensational ecclesiastical episodes on both
sides of the bay. At the last gathering
; of ministers in San Francisco, Mr. Law
created some talk, by charging that politi
cal methods were being introduced into
j the council. Some time later he pub
1 lished a statement crediting Treasurer
Van Bokkelen with knowingly misrepre
senting the financial condition of the
Church of the Advent.
Now the East Oakland rector states that
he has received numerous letters from
clergymen in the diocese protesting
against 'the methods of the diocesan
I treasurer. Rev. Mr. Law's spicy philippic
is as follows:
To answer numerous Inquiries in regard to
the treasurer of the diocese, we would state
I tliat Mr. Van Bokkelen Is not directly elected
j by the convention, but Is chosen by the seven
| directors of the corporation, and then becomes
ex-Ot&CiO treasurer of the diocese. These seven
directors are, however, chosen by the conven
tion. It Is, therefore, not at all likely that If a
resolution adverse to the present treasurer*
retention was passed In open convention It
! would be unheeded by this board of directors.
I Or a petition sent directly to the board of
directors after their election, signed by a ma
' jority of the clergy would also be likely to
jbe heeded. Judging from voluntary expres
sions of clerjry and laity, both personally and
In writing, which the rector has received within
the past two weeks, some such move may be
expected at the coming convention. The office
of diocesan treasurer "carries with it a salary
of $600 per annum, which, for the work re
'' quired. Is excellent remuneration, as the duties
of the position do not interfere with a man's
! regular business. Mr. Van Bokkelen has made
j himself very offensive to the clergy of this
i convocation by rising In the meetings of the
convocation and "rounding them up" in his
: well known objectionable and meddlesome
fashion, and they can be counted on to put
| the machinery in motion to put an end to such
a state of affairs.

THE SA:N T FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JUNE 5, 1898.
MANY TAXES
ARE NOT PAID
Water Front Company
Is Delinquent.
FEARS NO CLOUDED TITLE
FRANCHISES NOT USED ALSO
SUBJECT TO TAXATION.
Several Corporations Have Not Paid
Their Share for the Support
of the City Gov
ernment.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, June 4.
The delinquest tax list of' the city of
Oakland shows that thpre is a much
larger delinquency than usual. This is no
doubt owing to the fact that the large
territory north of Oakland, the city taxes
of which are now in dispute, is included
in the district covered by the Tax Col
lector's delinquencies.
By far the largest amount of taxes not j
, paid is that of the railroad company in I
,ts various branches. The Central Pacific
j Company has declined to pay $1890 50 on
: the ferry i depot and slip at the mole., and
$151 70 on the improvements at Long
: Wharf. Charles Goodall, a trustee repre
senting the mortgaged interests of the
water front at the foot of Myrtle and
Market streets, is delinquent for $246 80.
The Oakland Water Front Company
has not paid on nearly all of its claimed i
land. The amounts of $345. $555. $625, *1212
are all unpaid, and will be subject to the |
tax sale to be held on July 2.
The land of the Central Pacific Com- i
pany in \Vest Oakland is taxed for $810, j
â¢ while $41 is due from Charles Goodall as a ;
trustee, and $2 50 from the corporation for
: land in Clinton. All of this territory will
'be sold, but under the present compll- '
cated condition of water front title there ;
1 is little fear of any one purchasing it, for I
i a tax title would appear as a very small
: addition to all the titles and clouds now
j existing.
One of the most peculiar of the state- i
â¢ ments In the delinquent list is the assess-
I ment for $27 38 of a franchise granted five
I years ago to Sdwln K. Alsip of Sacra
mento and Welles Whitmore. The road :
: for which this franchise was granted has j
neven been built, and was to have ex
tended from Thirteenth and Franklin to
' the northern boundry line of the city.
Two rails were put down some years ago, j
: and nothing more was done. Since that ,
j time a resolution has been passed by tHe
I Council declaring the franchise forfeited,
; but it still appears on the delinquent list.
It would, indeed, be a hard matter for
the city Tax Collector to" purchase the
franchise and pay the taxis.
The little California and Nevada Rail
1 road Company has a little over a mil- of
road in this city which is taxed fur $64 42.
; but It is not paid, and as the road has
been in the hands of a receiver for some
time there is not much prospect of the i
I single mile being bought by any tax-title
sharp.
Some of the franchises of the Grove
street line are also taxed and $13 94 is due
from a small piece of road which coven
; nearly the same route as that Included In
the franchise of the old Central-a venue
railroad. This is presumably not puid
on the ground that two franchises along
j the same street cannot be taxed.
Another surprising feature of the list '
'â¢ is the large number of lots credited to i
â¢ "unknown owners." In nearly every block
| there is one or more tracts without an
| owner upon which taxes are delinquent.
CONSTABLE DICTATES
TO THE JUSTICE
NEW VIEWS ON DISTBIBUTING
PATRONAGE.
Justice Clift to Benefit by a Row Be
tween Justice Lawrence and
Constable Weldon.
Oakland Office San Francsco Call.
908 Broadway, June 4.
Justice Lawrence of Brooklyn Town
ship has been boycotted" by Constable
Weldon because he expects Mr. Weldon
to piy a portion of tho rent of the East
Oakland courtroom. The Justice business
in East Oakland is transacted by Justice
Lawrence Constable Glaze and Constable
\\eldon. Since the last election they have
done business in harmony, but now they
have quarreled.
When the three officials first took office
they agreed that they should share the
obligation of rent paying, and for a rear
all went smoothly. At the end of that
period Constable Weldon concluded that
he was taking so much business into the
court and thereby enabling the Justice to
earn so many fees that he was entitled to
free rent. The Justice did not take tin's
view of the case, and for many months
their relations have been strained.
A few days ago Justice Lawrence served
Weldon with a notice to quit, but as he
was in arrears for rent he declined to al
low the constable to remove his chattels.
Weldon, however, is accustomed to cir
cumventing belligerent litigants, and
yesterday morning, before the sun was
iip, he went to the courtroom and took
away his belongings. He now declares
that he will take all the business he can
to Justice Cliffs court in Oakland.
The amount earned by the constables
for the past year is $4!<r>-"> 86, while the Jus
tice earned but $1494. Therefore, on the
ba^ls of a general average, the constables
should have paid more than two-thirds of
the rent. This is the view held by JudgÂ«
Lawrence, and hence the difficulty.

A Life Saving Fender.
ALAMEDA, June 4.â Night before last
a little child, while attempting to cross
Santa Clara avenue, ran directly in front
of a rapidly moving electric car. The en
gineer tried to stop the vehicle, but could
not do so. It was stopped quickly, how
ever, when, to the relief' of all who saw
the accident, the child was found lying on
the fender entirely unhurt. This makes
the thirty-first life saved by the devices
in use on all the linos of the syndicate
system in Oakland, Alameda and vicinity.
It is an invention of a former employe
of the line and has never failed to work
like a charm.

The Ladies of the Red Cross to Work
All Sunday.
BERKELEY. June 4.â The executive
committee of the Berkeley branch of the
Red Cms? Society held a meeting yester
day afternoon at the residence of Mrs. C.
v. Greenleaf, on Bancroft way. As a re
sult of their discussion tho ladies of the
Red Cross will soon enlarge the sphere of
their duties. It was brought before the
attention of the meeting that some pro
vision should be made for the destitute
families of soldiers who have gone to the
front. Cases of urgent need of relief hr.va
already presented themselves, with which
the Red Cross workers have not been
able to deal. The executive committee
decided that it will at once organize a
special relief committee, whose duty it
shall be to attend to cases of this kind.
As yet the name of the chairman haa
not been announced. The place has al
ready been offered to a lady who has long
been prominent in charity work here, but
it still awaits ace. ptance.
The Red Cross headquarters in the
Hinkle block on Shattuck avenue will be
open all day to-morrow, and the ladies
will continue their work of making ban
dages.

THE NORTHERN BAPTISTS.
Will Hold Their Annual Convention
in the First Baptist Church
of This City.
At a recent meeting of the "Northern
Baptists" it was decided to hold the an
nual convention for 1899 at the First Bap
tist Church in this city next May. This
will mark the semi-centennial anniver
sary of the institution of the Baptist
church in California, and in fact the Pa
cific Coast.
The "Baptists of the North," as they
term themselves, number more than a
million communicants, and their three
great missionary societies have Jiist com
pleted the annual convention for this year
at Rochester, N. Y. The society claims
to have expended more than a million dol
lars during the past year in furthering
the work of the society.
The report states that the Foreign Mis
sionary Society has under its supervision
1800 churches with over 200.U00 members
and 2000 ministers. The Home Mission
Society has about 1000 laborers, who sup
ply about 17(W churches a!hd missions.
During the year 200 additional churches
were added to this number, aggregating
for the entire Home "Mission 1900 places
of worship supported by Baptists.
The Baptists of the entire coast are
looking forward with considerable an
ticipation to the convention next May,
and will soon begin the work of arranging
a system for the rendering of reports and
investigations to be submitted during the
coming convention. Dr. Woods, who has
been attending the convention in the
East, has returned to the city, and will
take possession of the First Baptist
Church, which he has conducted for a
number of years.

Army officers had a busy time of It
yesterday among the transports. The
British steamers Whitgift and Ning- I

of the opinion that in the purchase of i

jiolntment to the examining boards
who went over her yesterday. She was
supposed to be ready to go to sea with
. fiSO troops as soon as the stores could
;be put aboard, but Instead of that she
cannot be got ready in a week. She is
'only provided with a small icehouse
and haa no refrigerator. Yet it is
claimed she is ready to carry troops
through the tropics. There in no blower
in the 'tween decks, she is not equipped
in the steward's department to handle
a crowd and the cooking appliances are
very meager. The sanitary appliances
are wretched and the sleeping quarters
of the men have already been described
in The Call.
Captain C. Miner Goodall and Frank
Bragg, secretary of the Marine Engi
neers' Association, assert that the Cen
. tennial was condemned by the British
Government. She was then put under
the Japanese flag, and after a time the
Government of Tokio condemned her.

She then wandered under the Danish
flag and now comes under the stars and
stripes as a first-class troopship.
The sale of the Centennial was engi
neered by a syndicate formed on Puget
Sound and the members of it were de
lighted when the Danish flag was haul
ed down and the stars and stripes took
its place. Seat-Ue was jubilant over the
transaction, and the Post-Intelligencer
devoted nearly two columns to the
event and a description of the steamer.
The facts of the case have been tele
graphed to the authorities at Washing
ton, and "until they are heard from lit
tle or nothing will be done to the Cen
tennial. In the meantime Captain Long
and the medical board of examiners
appointed by GeneraJ Merritt are pre
paring exhaustive reports.
The Government is going to have
more difficulty in getting competent en
gineers to man the Whitgift, Xing
chow and Centennial. The men have
English licenses, but as the steamers
are now American vessels the engineers
must have American licenses and be
American citizens. Frank Bragg, sec
retary of the Marine Engineers' Asso
ciation, has the matter in charge and
will see to it that all the vessels are
properly manned.
The steamer China has still a por
tion of her Chinese crew employed. The
i coal-passers are at work trimming the
i coal as it comes aboard and they will
remain by the vessel until the white
new is signed on next Wednesday. In
the case of the City of Peking the <"hi
nppe coal-passers remained by the ships
until the white crew was signed on.
The British steamer Whitgift was
purchased from Houlder, Middleton &
| Co., of London, England, through
Meyer, Wilson & Co. of this city. The
i purchase price is not given, but it must
' have been a good round sum, as the
; vessel had a $20,000 charter to take a
general cargo from Portland, Or., to
Vladivostok. She arrived here on May
11 from Calcutta with a cargo of gun
nies and jute, and on May 28 she was
'â  ready for sea. The negotiations for
. her purchase began on that date and
were completed yesterday.
The Whitgift was built by J. L.
Thompson & Sons of Sunderland, Ene
1 land, in IS9F>, and is a fine steel steamer
iof 2925 tons gross and 1880 tons net
register. She is 312 feet long, 41 feet
broad and 20 feet deep. She is a good
carrier and could be fitted out to ac
commodate about a thousand troops.
Captain Bowling and his officers and
all the engineers have their belongings
ashore and will start for England as
soon as the steamer has been handed
over to the Government.
The British steamer Nlngchow came
here from Comox, B. C, with 2825 tons
j of coal, arriving on May 24, and went
i direct to Mare Island, where she is at
i present. Negotiations for her pur
chase were begun when the vessel was
I still on the Sound and they have now
j only been completed. She is a some
: what similar vessel to the Whitgift,
i but ten years older. She was built in
! 18S4 at Glasgow by D. and W. Hender
: son & Co., and is 2708 tons gross and
| 1735 tons net register. She is 350 feet
Jong. 41 feet 8 inches broad and 23 feet
T. inches deep. The Ningchow was
â  owned by the China Mutual Steam
Navigation Company, Limited, of Lon
'â¢ don. She will carry about the same
number of troops as the Whitgift and
| will make a good transport or coal ship.
| Captain Cross and his officers and all
| the engineers will leave the steamer as
â  soon as she is turned over to the Gov
j ernment and will go back to England.

STABBED IN
JEALOUS RAGE
Wm. Walters Wounded
by His Paramour.
SHE CLAIMS HE WAS FALSE
MAY STEWART, A NOTORIOUS
WOMAN, THE ASSAILANT.
His Injury Is Serious and the Knife-
Wielder Has Been Locked
Up in the City-
Prison.
A lovert 1 ' quarrel prompted by jeal
ousy resulted in William Walters be
ing stabbed by his paramour, May
Stewart, at the rooms of the woman
%t 122 Post street late yesterday after
noon. Walters' wound, which is quite
a dangerous one, was dressed by Dr.
Lord last evening and the man was
then removed to his room in the lodg
ing-house where the woman lives.
She was arrested by Detectives Gibson
and Wren and was locked up at the
California street station charged with
assault with a deadly weapon.
Walters is employed at the Temple
Bar as night porter and has been con
sorting with the woman for some
time. According to his version of the
affair the woman had been drinking
heavily during the day, and when he
went to the room about 5 o'clock in the
evening she accused him of being un
true to her. She attacked him, and in
the struggle bit his finger, and after
ward took a dirk he always carried
and stabbed him in the right breast.
He left the place, and a couple of hours
later while in a restaurant on Pine
street he met Dr. Lord and asked him
to dress the wound. Walters went up j
to the rooms of the doctor, where it
was found that the dirk had pene
trated to the depth of four inches, in-
flic-ting a serious wound, which had to
he closed with three stitches. After
having his injury attended to Walters
determined to have the woman ar
rested, so he notified the police.
May Stewart is a notorious woman,
who formerly conducted a disreputable
house at 316 Stockton street. While
she would say very little in regard to
the cutting, she acknowledged that she
had stabbed her lover. She claims that
Walters has been abusing her for mime
time and that she but recently got rid
of a black eye which he administered
to her about a month ago. Yesterday
afternoon, she says, Walters came to
her room and they quarreled. She was
eating an apple at the time and had a
knife with which to cut the fruit. Dur
ing tho quarrel he struck her in the
mouth, whereupon she swung the knife
around and stabbed him. A badly
Fwollen lip substantiates this part o*f
the woman's story.
A friend of Walters says that both
the parties to the affair have been
drinking hard and that there have been
frequent quarrels between them He
says they had trouble early yesterday
morning and that the woman was
struck by the man. Later Walters
went back to the room and demanded
money from the woman and the talk
ensuing from his request resulted in the
stabbing.
Walters was resting easily last even
ing, and while the wound is serious It
will probably not prove fatal.

WHEAT HAS BEEN
A DISAPPOINTMENT
RESUME OF GRAIN TRADE FOB,
THE WEEK.
The Crop of the United States and
Canada Will Be the Largest Yet.
California the Only State
With a Shortage.
The past week has been one of disap
pointment to wheat producers and the
bull element. Liverpool operators, fear-
Ing heavy movement of new wheat to
French markets, caused a general sell
ing of futures to hedge out spot wheat
held In store. The enormous shipments
of wheat from Russia, regardless of re
ports of famine from the interior of Rus
sia, seems a quandary to the speculative
interest. The Russian press claims wheat
is being exported in large quantities when
people in many sections are without food.
The big prices paid by French and Eng
lish importers has put wheat out of reach
of the poorer classes.
The rye crop, which is Â»-- of the staple
foods of the Russian peasant, was short
last year. The price of this commodity
has also gone beyond the reach of the
poor. Reports from other wheat growing
countries are on tne whole favorable.
The wheat crop of France will be an av
erage one, against a half crop last year.
India continues to export large quanti
ties. The Argentine is not lacking in lib
eral shipments. The tail end of their crop
is nearly reached.
The crop of the United States and
Canada, basing an estimate upon present
conditions, wili exceed any previous year.
California being ahout the only State
showing a crop failure. The prospects at
present point to a crop of 4(X),000 tons
some think 500,000 tons. The latter u^ure
appears unreasonable. To offset Califor
nia, Washington and Oregon will raise
more than enough in excess of their
usual crop to make up for California's
loss. East of the Rockies crop experts
place the growing crops at 650.000,000. The
largest crop heretofore harvested was,
according to the Government Bureau of
Information, 612,000,000. This amount took
in the Pacific Coast.
The almost exhausted stocks of all
wheat producing countries is a matter of
no small importance. The very high prices
prevailing', more particularly during the
past three months, has drained every
farm of its surplus. These supplies have
found their way to market, and, generally
speaking, into consumption. There is
now in the visible supply less than 23,

Dr\ Pillsbury of the Cooper Medi
cal College has at last succeeded
in finding and separating the
poison of the bacilli of tubercu
losis after years of careful ex
periments*
AT last the alkaloid of bacilli tu
berculosis has been discovered.
This is another great step
toward the production of a cure
for the dreaded white plague,
consumption, and unless all chemljpal
law? turn out to be erroneous will make
an era in the history of medical sci
ence.
The man who has accomplished this
wonderful aehivement is Dr. Ernest S.
Flllsbury, instructor in bacteriology of
Cooper Medical College, this city.
He has been working on his theory
for several years, and now feels that
he has accomplished something that is
sure to produce results beneficial to
the human race.
"I do not claim to have produced a
cure for consumption," said Dr. Pills
bury, "but I do claim to have Isolated
the poison that produces such deadly
results. I cannot find any record of
anybody else ever having done this be

fore, so I feel that I can claim the right
of discovery.
"My future work will be along lines
that have been proved to be successful
in other deadly diseases, diphtheria for
instance.
"Of course it may take me a long
time to find out the exact nature of the
poison I have isolated, and on the other
hand, I may do it in a few weeks. After
that to figure out an antidote should
not be such a very difficult matter.
Chemical laws are pretty well under
stood, and when a certain component
is known we can always figure out
what will neutralize it. It has never
failed yet."
In order that the lay mind may fully
.grasp the importance and meaning of
Dr. Pillsbury's discovery some expla
nation will be necessary.
The ordinary conception of the way
In which the deadly bacillus does its
work' is that it simply destroys the
fleshy tissue, much after the fashion
of chewing or tearing. But while this
is done to a great extent death always
results long before enough of the tissue
disappears to have produced drath.
Add to this the condition and general
appearance of a consumptive patient
and everything points to the work of
poison that has been generated by the
bacilli.
This same phenomenon has already
been observed in other forms of bac
terial poisoning, and it Is pretty well
understood and can be combated to a
certain extent.
ThiÃ form of poisoning is called
"Ptbmain poisoning," and the difficulty
of curing it lies entirely in the fact that
It is -so. rapid in its work the patient
frequently dies before a doctor can be
summoned. The ptomain is the poi-
Bon generated by the bacilli that have
come into existence in decomposing
meat or fishâ the most deadly variety
being found in shell fish.
If this poison is injected into any liv
ing creature and the known antidote
administered within a few minutes no
evil results will follow. But if the pa
tient be neglected for even a few hours
d^mh is almost certain.
On this basis, common ptomain pois
DR. ROSENAU'S OPINION OF THE DISCOVERY.
"Dr. Pillsbury has certainly made a most important discovery,
but 01 its relative importance we cannot of course judge at present.
Only results can show that. Should it prove the means of discov
ering a cure for consumption its importance is of course beyond es
timate. There have been a umber of extracts made from the pure
bacilli, but I never heard of anybody ever making a pure alkaloid
before."
THE CALL Sunday Edition
oning from lobster is much more deadly
than consumption. In combating this
ptomain poisoning medical science sim
ply makes use of the old and well un
derstood chemical law of "poison and
antidote," which in reality is nothing
more than a certain manifestation of
nature's law â balance.
The nature of ptomain poison be
ing known the antidote has already
beÂ»>n found and whenever it is admin
istered before the patient is in his
"death agony" a cure follows just as
certain as the administering of quinine
cures certain fevers by acting as an
antidote to the poison produced by the
malaria bacilli.
It is on these lines that the dreaded
diphtheria is cured. The so-called
antitoxin that is injected into the pa
tient is nothing more nor less than the
antidote for the poison that causes the
disease.
It is on exactly these same lines that
Dr. Pillsbury hopes to be able to ob
tain a cure for consumption, and It
muft admitted that chemical science
point.- to the ultimate success of his
work.
The discovery and isolation of the
poison, or alkaloid, is surely the first
step toward finding an antidote
What this will be in the case of bacilli
tuberculosis poison cannot, of course
be even guessed at just at the present
stage of development. it may be or
ganic or it may be Inorganic. It may
be some simple alkaloid of the same
character as genuine, or it may be
some form of antitoxin similar to' that
now so successfully used in diphthe
rla.
The principal difference between
HOW TO ISOLATE THE ALKALOID OF
BACILLI TUBERCULOSIS.
According to Dr. Plllsbury's method.
The pure washed bacilli culture is washed in water acidulated
with hydrochloric acid. It is then washed again in pure re-dis
tilled alcohol and then filtered. The fll'iatj is then distilled and the
residue dissolved in water and precipitated with phosmolybdic acid.
Again the product is filtered and the residue broken up with
Baryta water. The barium is then precipitated with carbon diox
ide. The filtrate is then evaporated and the residue exhausted
with alcohol, which gives the alkaloid in a comparatively pure
state.
It is now in the form of white crystals and answers all the usual
tests for alkaloids, such as chloride of gold, chloride of platinuti,
etc., leaving no doubt but that it is the pure alkaloid of bacilli
tuberculosis.
what Dr. Pillsbury hopes to do and
what has been so unsuccessfully at
tempted in the past is that his plan is
on the lines of neutralizing the poison
that produces death, while all other
methods have simply been on the anti
septic principle â i. c., an effort to de
stroy the bacilli themselves, entirely ig
noring the fact that the tiny organisms

produced and left in the system any
poison.
Dr. Pillsbury's theory will account
for the cause of consumptive patients
dying even after bacilli hadapparently
disappeared from thu- organism.
In making his experiments in his lab
oratory at Cooper Medical College Dr.
Pillsbury has used billions and billions
of bacilli tuberculosis. In order to get
enough even to make a small test it
was necessary to breed them just as a
farmer would breed chickens or pigs.
This process simply consists of in
jecting a small number of the living
bacilli into a specially prepared veal
broth and keeping it at a temperature
of about 100 degrees. From the tiny
speck at first visible in the compound
the microbes spread all through the
mass of broth in a few weeks.
They were then washed out with al
cohol and water and put into a large
jar for future use.
Of course this washing kills them, but
it leaves with them all of their or
ganic elements.
In this condition the mass of bacilli
looks like a jar of corn meal and can
be handled in much the same manner.
It is from this that the alkaloid is
produced. Dr. Plllsbury's method of
preparing the alkaloid, .Â«Â»: poison left
DR. ERNEST S. PILLSBURY,
INSTRUCTOR IN EACTERIOLOGY, COOPER MEDICAL COLLEGE, IN HIS LABORATORY.
Dr. Fillsbury ;s the man who is entitled to the honor of having made cne of the most important bacteri
ological discoveries of the decade. In isolating: the alkalord, or active principal, of bacilli tuberculosis he has
opened the dcor to the finding of a cure for con sump ion, the dreaded white plague. Scientifically a cure is
now neartr at hand than ever befor\ Dr. Piilsbury has worked years at his theory and in order to make his
tests has bred billions of bi lions of bacilli tuberculosis.
in the system by the bacilli, is as fol
lows:
The pure washed bacilli cul
ture is washed in water acidu
lated with hydrochloric acid. It
is then washed again in pure
re-distilled alcohol and filtered.
The filliate is then distilled and
the residue dissolved in water
and precipitated with phospho
molybdic acid.
Again the product is filtered
and the residue bmkr-n up with
Baryta water. The barium is
then precipitated with carbon
dioxide. The filtrate is thfn
evaporated and the residue ex
hausted with alcohol, which
glvis the alkaloid in a compara
tively pure state.
It is now in the form of white
crystals and answers all the
usual tests for alkaloids, such as
chloride of gold, chloride of plat
inum, etc., leaving no doubt but
that it is the pure alkaloid of
bacilli tuberculosis.
As a still further proof that it is the
alkaloid of the bacilli tuberculosis, Dr.
Piilsbury injected a small amount of
it into a guinea pig, and although there
was not the slightest trace of the or
ganism in the mixture, the animal dis
played all the symptoms of consump
tion.
A number of scientific medical men
in this cily were questioned in regard
to what they thought of Dr. Pillsbury's
discovery, and while a few were in
clined to be skeptical of the ultimate
result, all agreed that the discovery
was a most important one and almost
sure to lead to beneficial results.
Dr. Gustav Eisen of the Academy of
Sciences thought the discovery of the
alkaloid almost as important as the
discovery of the bacilli itself. Reason
ing from our present chemical knowl
edge it is the most important step
toward a cure for consumption that
hurt ever been made.
Dr. Koseneau of the Government
Quarantine Station said: "Dr. Pills
bury has certainly made a most im
portant discovery, but of its relative
importance we cannot of course judge
at present. Only results can show that.
Should It prove the means Qf discov
ering a cure for consumption its im
portance is of course beyond estimate.
There have been a number of extracts
made from the pure bacilli, but I never
heard of anybody ever making a pure
alkaloid before."

tion is discovered the sooner humanity
will be benefited.
Following is a technical paper writ
ten for The Call by Dr. Pillsbury.giving
his reaso-ns for thinking that he is on
the right road toward the discovery of
a cure for consumption:
IT is now known that Instead of bac
teria being harmful from their con
suming to any marked extent the
proteids of the organism and there
by depriving ony of the organs of
their necessary sustenance, the patho-
Uenic action of bacteria is duo to the
chemical products of their metabolism,
either producing a soluble chemical fer
ment which ;-. lits up the i omplex pro
teids of its host, some of the spilt pro
ductÃ being poisonous, or the bacteria cell
may contain the specific poison as a secre
tion or excretion, a product of assimila
tion.
It should not be hard for us to realize
that these little plants may produce poi
sons that have such powerful effects when
we realize the favorable conditions of the
soil and temperature of their suscep
tible host, both being ideal conditions for
the rapid multiplication of bacteria.
The "period of incubation" of an in
fectious disease is the time required
from the inception of the few bacteria
of variable virulence for them to over
come the natural resistance of the host
and produce, in their peculiar way, suffi
cient poison to cause systematic disturb
ances.
Some of these chemical products com
bine with certain acids forming' salts â
such products are ptomaines or bacterial
alkaloids. If the word ptomaine was
dropped and Instead the term bacterial
alkaloid? used, their composition would
not seem quite so indefinite to so many;
for the bettor known alkaloids derived
from the higher plants as atropine from
the bolk'.donnae, strychnine from the
seed of strychnos, mix vomica. or mor
phine from the poppy,- are In daily use,
and their effects pretty well understood.
The bacterial alkaloids are, like the al
kaloids of the higher plants, variable in
their action in different individuals of a
species and, of course, vary greatly in
their effects upon the different genera of
the animal kingdom.
As an instance of this I can cite S.
Weir Mltchel. who has shown that many
birds are insusceptible to the toxic action
of opium, while a single drop of the
aqueous extract will throw a sparrow Into
a profound stupor. Guinard has shown
that in the cat morphine produces violent
hyperexcitability, great restlessness, agi
tation, hallucinations, dilated pupils, and
if the dose be very large tetanic convul
sions develop.
Harley found that on dogs morphine
acts much as upon man. In the horse
two to three grains of morphine produce
sometimes a slight drowsiness, sometimes
no perceptible effect.
This instance of so familiar a drug
varying so in Its action on different ani
mals shows us that even leaving out the
question of suitability of soil and assum
ing what is not so, that all animals offer
similarly favorable conditions for the de
velopment of bacteria, we can with good
reason assume that the poisons developed
by the so-called pathogenic bacteria i~Â£
feet only such animals as are susceptible
to the action of their specific poisons.
Rabbits have a great natural resistance
to the action of tuberculosis. Two white
re, M its T inoculated in October, 1897, re-
InocuJated in November and again in Jan
uary with very virulent cultures of the
tubercle bacilli did not succumb. One
killed in March, the other in May, showed
only slight tubercular lesions at the
points of injection. Guinea pigs inoculat
ed with the same cultures died in twenty
and twenty-three days with tubercles dis
seminated throughout the abdominal cav
ity.
Other instances may be given almost
without end and all confirm the theory
that the systemic effects of Infectious dis
eases are due solely to the chemical poi
sons produced by bacteria.
It .has been shown by elaborate experi
mentation that animals may become ac
customed to various well-known poisons
by the administration of gradually in
creased doses and- that the serum taken
from these; animals and injected Into a
normal animal together, with an otherwise
fatal dose of the same poison will so nul
lify its poisonous effects that the second
animal will be' unharmed. Further, suc
cessive injections of serum from such ac
customed, or immunized animals â  will pro
duce a condition of Immunization against
this "same poison. "'. ' '- '. â¢'/' v ;: - : '. :
What this "defensive proteid" sub
stance is that is generated In the blood to
produce this Immunity to, or neutraliza
tion of, the poison Is not yet known, but its
effect is that of a chemical and physio
logical antidote. This is also shown by
Nuttall and Lubarsh, who found that the
bactericidal power of the animal serum
did not correspond to the Immunity of tha
animal furnishing 1 the serum.
Now since it hns been shown that the
effects of infectious diseases are due to
the bacterial alkaloids in some Instances
at least and perhaps ferments in others,
does it not follow that the scientific treat
ment of such diseases would consist in
the administration of the chemical and
physiological antidotes of the specific al
kaloid, the prevention of reinfection by
the local use of antiseptics, and the scien
tific nourishment of the body?
Neurin is an Interesting- poisonous bacte
rial alkaloid. In frogs very small amounts

ties. The heart beats more and more
slowly and finally stops in diastole. If at
this point atroplne be injected the heart
begins to beat again.

theria bacilli by the germicidal action of
the serum. So we have "Aseptolin-Ed
son" and like antiseptic mixtures. The
folly of such solutions is apparent when
we realize that to inject sufficient to
make the blood a germicidal solution it
would be death to the blood.
Koch thought to cure consumption by
gradually increased doses of a crude solu
tion of the very poison produced by the
bacillus tuberculosis and to produce an
immunity such as may be done with the
self-limited infectious diseases. If it waa
possible to do this with consumption the
patient should get well of himself, for
surely the diseap" lasts long enough. But
this has been found to be impossible -it
would be like injecting morphine into a
"dope" fiend.
Injecting sufficient tubercle bacilli â even
dead onesâ into animals which have been
considered immunized against tubercu
losis produces the characteristic abcess,
and proves that killing the bacteria is not
sufficient to cure the disease.
The many preparations of serum, such
as "Anti-tubercle Serum," "Anti-phthisio
Serum" and similar so-called consumption
cures taken from the horses and mules
which received repeated Injections of
crude tuberculine for the purpose of pro
ducing an artificial immunity are no bet
ter than similar serums taken from white
rabbits which have as much natural im
munity as is acquired by these horses and
mules.
I believe consumption, the terrible whita
plague, is curable, but not on that basis.
I have separated by a modification of
Sonnenschein's process an alkaloid from
tubercle bacilli in pure culture, but so
far have not separated sufficient for full
testing. When the physiological effects
of the pure alkaloid are known it will be
an easier step to produce its antidote,
which may be organic or inorganic.
Syphiiis is a disease having many points

able, and justly so. Its antidote has been,
discovered, accldently perhaps, but still
we have a specific for the disease.
In quinine we have an antidote for tha
toxine produced by the malarial para
site.
I believe the day is not far distant when
the physician will diagnose the infectious
disease to which he is called, not by the
fever chart but by a chemical analysis
of the urine, which carries off these
bacterial alkaloids in solution, and he
will treat and cure h's patient by the
hypodermic administration of the physio

AN alliance between Great Britain
and the United Statesâ that is,
between all countries and peo
ples speaking the English lan
guageâis now fully within the
contemplation of practical poli
ticians. Whether a treaty will soon
be negotiated is another matter.
Politicians on both sides of the water
are at least preparing their own minds
and the minds of the people of Eng
land and America by considering and
discussing the possibility of such an
agreement. By the very act of doing
po they have brought the people of the
two countries nearer together, and in
England a strong popular sentiment al
ready exists in favor of a union.
It would be difficult to fix the period
at which this English sentiment of de
cided friendliness toward America be
gan its present strong and gratifying
manifestation, but, paradoxical as it
may seem, we are inclined to credit the
Venezuela Incident with the awakening
of that respect for us which is so ob
vious an element of the existing feel
ing of the British press and public to
ward Americans.
At least there is no doubt that Eng
lish public men and English society did
not look upon Mr. Ulney's dispatches
to Mr. Bayard, and upon Mr. Cleve
land's message, in the same way as
they struck Borne of us in this country
who did not agree with the President
and his Secretary of State.
Be this as it may, the fact that an
international alliance is desired by
Englishmen of all parties is now one
of the foremost facts of international
politics. If it had not been so before
by reason of the frank confessions of
English sympathy for us in our war
with Spain, and by active and material
aid afforded us by the Government at
THE PRESENT WAR WITH SPAIN AND ITS MEANING.
John W. Foster is one of tha most eminent diplomats in America to-day. He was for many years
counsel for the Mexican Legation at Washington. He has been Secretary of State, Minister to Spain,
agent of the United States in many delicate diplomatic negotiations and the agent of China in her settle
ment of the Japan-China war.
4 General Foster has made a profession of diplomacy, and to-day he is acting as the agent of the De
partment of State in negotiating with Sir Julian Pauncefote, the British Ambassador, and a representa
tive of the Dominion Government at Ottawa, a treaty which shall settle the boundary line between Can
ada and the United States. This diplomatic mission, Mr. Foster explained, prevented him talking as
freely as he might otherwise have done about matters now pending or which may soon come before the
State Department.
WHEN this war is ended Spain will have
nothing left but the peninsula. "
It is possible that Spain will retain the
Canary Islands when the conflict is over,
but not if the war is prolonged.
But I do not think this war will extend over any
considerable period. I don't see how Spain can afford
to prolong it. She has no resources. And if, as is
probable, we destroy her fleets she cannot replace
them. They talk of sending troops to the Philippines.
Spain can never do that. She has not got them to
send. She can raise any number of men to defend
her own coast, but not to send to her colonies.
I have lived in Spain and I know and have the
kindest personal feeling for her leading men. I have
the kindest feeling for the Queen. But I cannot see
how this war could have been avoided. Spain had to
fl CALIFORNIA GIRL'S VIEW OF THE ANQLO ALLIANCE.
THE impression seems to be gain
ing ground in the United States
that English sympathies are en
tirely with America in the pres
ent war.
This is a mistake, for while
the dignified attitude of the President
is warmly praised, the policy forced on
him by Congress is as heartily con
demned by the thinking English public
as it is in other European countries.
I have noticed, during the three years
I have been on this side of the water,
the half-veiled hostility of most Euro
peans toward America and Americans.
I have been at a loss to explain this
except by a feeling of jealousy at the
growing power of so young a nation.
Thh hostility, in spite of the 'various
declarations of neutrality, has now be
openly avowed, in England, as
well us on the C ntinent.

premacy in every land where the sun
shines, and the English tongue is des
tined to be the official language of the
world. Even Cassack and Chinamen
will eventually converse in the tongue
of John Bull and Uncle Sam. This
fight over Cuba will lead the way for
the elimination of Spain from the map
of nations. I believe that Spanish
barbarism will be forever crushed be
fore the close of the century beneath
the heel of humanity.
The time is ripe for a union of Eng
land and America to act together in
the name of progress and humanity and
civilize the world. Such a combina
tion will possibly come sooner than we
expect. Let them combine and do it
peaceably, if possible, but by the per
suasive eloquence of the cannon's
mouth, if necessary. It will be a sur
vival of the fittest.
Spain is a good subject to begin on
as an object lesson. No one can tell
where the result of our war with
Spain will end, but I think the best
way to free bleeding Cuba and settle
the war is for the United States to
whip Spain quickly, and give it a
thorough licking while it is at it. It
has deserved it ever since it murdered
our sailors, first in the Virginius af
fair and later when the martyrs of
the Maine were killed while they slept
by Spanish treachery.
I have no fear of European interven
tion in behalf of Spain, because Spain
has no friends, with the possible ex
ception of marriage ties in Austria.
No nation feels like clasping the hand
of a nation dripping with the blood
of murdered sailors of a friendly power.
When we free Cuba let the people
there decide whether or not they want
the island annexed to the United
States. We do not want Cuba unless
she wants us. This war is not waged
to get possession of Cuba, but to free
the Cubans. Personally Ido not favor
annexation. Cuba ought to be free,
and I believe the Cubans are capable
choose between giving up Cuba and fighting the
United States, and if Spain had given up Cuba there
would have been a revolution which would have over
thrown the present dynasty.
This war was inevitable. And since It was inevit
able the sooner it came the better. Spain had been
destroying our peace and interfering with our com
merce and we must have intervened. Since Buchan
an's time it has been the policy of the United States
to free the people of Cuba. In fact for nearly a cen
tury we have had in mind the removal of Spanish
authority from the island.
Spain once offered us great commercial advantages
if we would guarantee her sovereignty by treaty, but
we refused to do so. Twice Spain and France ap
proached us to ask that we assure Spain's control of
Cuba, but we would not do it. Grant recognized the
right of Cuba to be free in his message to Congress in
1869. Secretary Hamilton Fish recognized it when he
zette, both of which are read by the
wealthier and better educated classes
criticize in no mild terms the American
policy.
The Gazette quotes one of the French
papers as saying: "What a service
Spanish arms would render humanity
in destroying, once for all, the pretense
| of American greatness," and adds on
its own account: "There are Germans
who think the same; and both powers
might well be encouraged to speak out
by Spanish success in the Old Bahama
Channel, and then we might be touched
very closely."
It goes on to say that the war has
been brought about by politicians who
hold Mr. Olney's idea of the Monroe
doctrine on one hand and Mr. Bryan's
silver leanings on the other. In a word,
it is a war made by politicians for par
ty purposes or the furtherance of their
own private ends.
And this view Is held by the large
majority of English people.

England seems to be jealous of her
own possessions in America, and thinks
if the United States establish a prece
dent in interfering in Spanish affairs,
the time will come when her own
American colonies will be' subjected to
the same treatment.
Some of the papers are still exhibit
ing soreness over the Venezuela epi
sode and disclaim any likelihood of an
Anglo-American alliance, and the "bill
ing and cooing going on at present be
tween emotional Anglo-Americans" is
attributed to the lower classes.
Here is a pertinent incident: An at
tempt at a demonstration was made
during the performance of the "Belle of
New York." The British and American
nags were hung together on the stage
and a patriotic song was sung. It was
coldly received, the only applause com
ing from the "gods."
The working classes show great in
terest in the war and their sympathies
are enlisted on the American side. But
the methods of other governments
which exploit themselves in the same
field. None can stand quite alone.
England does so more nearly than any
other power, but she has reached that
position only by reason of many alli
ances. She was at the head of the
European alliance against Louis XIV,
against Napoleon and against Russia
in the Crimean War.
In this Spanish affair we may not see
the end until we apply the match to the
Continental situation by an invasion of
the Spanish peninsula.
Nothing is more likely in the future
of our career than that we must seek
or be sought in alliance. With what
country can we make it if not with
England? Since Washington violated
the French treaty of offensive and de
fensive alliance by his commercial con
vention with England, she has grown
to be our most profitable customer. No
other country can take her place as a
market for the surplus products of our
industry.
The path wherein our feet are now
planted leads of necessity to alliances,
and from our present standpoint Eng

ly, is not, In my opinion, necessary for
our national safety. Such an alliance
does not hold out sufficient promise of
advantage in other respects to make it
prudent for us to undergo the risks of
becoming embroiled in purely English
wars, which such an alliance would in
evitably involve.
The true American policy is that laid
down by the fathers of the republic â
amity with all nations; entangling alli
ances with none.
Our geographical position, our re
sources, our population and our insti
tutions make us superior to the need
of an alliance as a general proposition,
and it would be the height of folly to
enter into a bargain where we have all
to lose and m.-thing very substantial in
sight to gain. The exigencies of a war
â certainly not this Spanish war as it
stands at present â may possibly at
some time require us to seek allies, but
those particular occasions may be
trusted to take care of themselves.
Every year adds to our strength far
more than to the strength of any na
tion on earth, and as we grow stronger
we will become less and less in need of
alliances.
A powerful navy, a small standing
army, with plenty of available educa
ted West Pointers to command the
volunteers when called upon â these, to
gether with a happy, prosperous and
educated people to pay the taxes and
to do the fighting, is the combination
said that autonomy might postpone but it could not
prevent the consummation of Cuba's fight for free
dom.
War has been inevitable since Mr. Cleveland made
the mistake of supposing that Spain could settle the
Cuban question by granting autonomy to the Cubans.
Mr. McKinley inherited that policy and he had to
give it a fair trial. But that trial showed how hope
less it was and how inevitable was the conflict. It
was as Mr. Fish had saidâ autonomy could only post
pone the freedom of Cuba.
Spain could not offer an autonomous government
to Cuba when she herself had never had autonomy.
It would take a long time to explain the system of
Spanish rule, but briefly it is this: When a new
administration comes in Governors are appointed for
the forty odd provinces; these Governors go out
within a day or two to take control of affairs. They
appoint their prefects and their sub-prefects. Then
the election is held. It always goes in favor of the
Governors. It always will.
Spain's rule in Cuba has been worse than her rule
at home. It could not be expected that she would
break up entirely the system under which so many
representatives of Spanish families have lived on
Cuba, and a system of self-government which would
leave the reins of power in the hands of Spaniards
would be a misnomer.
We had no right to expect the Cuban people to
accept autonomy from Spain. Suppose that in 1778,
when the heroes of the Revolution had been battling
for independence for three years, and after they had
beaten Burgoyne, Lord North had said: "We were
mistaken. We will grant you representation in Par
liament and a voice in the matter of taxation"â for
that the more intelligent and governing
classes are on the side of Spain is
shown by the numerous letters pub
lished every day in different papers.
The Countess of Casa Valencia, wife
of the ex-embassador of Spain to the
court of St. James, is receiving numer
ous letters expressing sympathy for
Spain from the most prominent people,
and subscriptions are pouring in to her
fund to aid the sick and wounded.
The other European powers show
their Spanish sympathies in various
ways. They blame Spain for the mis
government of Cuba, but at the same
time they hold the United States re
sponsible for the continuance of the re
bellion.
The time is not far off when the alli
ance will probably be an accomplished
fact, but the American people must not
think that it has been formed because
of sympathy in the present war, or be
cause of the "blood thicker than wa
ter" principle, which has been so over
done by some of the American papers.

The Cubans had held out against Spain for three
years. Two hundred thousand troops nad been sent
ag-ainst them â there were 100,000 in Cuba when this
war broke out; we do not know how many have died
sinee â and the report' of our Consuls and of trust
worthy men who went into Cuba last winter was that
the Spaniards held the cities by force of arms; that
they had abandoned the rest of the country, and
that the war might go on indefinitely.
Under the conditions it was our business to in
terfere. Mr. Cleveland thought that we could per
suade the Cubans to lay down their arms under a
promise of autonomy. But no nation has the right to
guarantee what it cannot enforce. The Cubans re
fused to accept autonomy and it was our duty to fol
low out the policy of the United States of half a cen
tury and declare them free. As to Spain, she could
not withdraw from Cuba without precipitating a revo
lution, and so war had to come. I have believed for
two years that it was inevitable and that the sooner
it was over the better.
At one time the United States, not officially, made
overtures to the Spanish bondholders Tor the assump
tion or guarantee of at least a part of the Cuban
debt by this country, but they were not willing to
accept it.
I hope Cuba will not be annexed to the United
States. That is a matter which affects our honor.
We have entered on this war in the name of humanity

Whenever the need shall arise I am sure the man

the United States in diplomacy is remarkable. It
equals the record of any of the nations of Europe.
After the revolutionary war the treaty with England
which our commissioners negotiated waa generally
admitted to be a triumph of diplomacy. In the treaty
of 1814 Lord Wellington admitted that we had got
the better of the English commissioners. He made
that statement in Parliament.
As to recent negotiations political prejudice warps

diplomacy by Mr. Seward in the Cabirfet, by Mr.
Adams in London, and by our other representatives
abroad. It is acknowledged that in the treaty of 1883
out of which grew the Geneva Convention, we gained
a distinct advantage. I think we need have no fear
of diplomatic difficulties.

command of our national army.
He won fame and honor as
Sheridan's chief oflicer in the great bat
ti-:- â¢ f the war. H- was an unrelent
ing warrior, once lighting nine battles
in ten successive days.
His military career is more or less on
rd, but of his .private life little has
been given t" the public.

Willis Merritt, was a New York lawyer,
having an office at 134 Nassau

cember I, lvX at c: North ft
street. He was one of eight brothers.
TV- nty months later the law office was
; t 'l Spruce street, the family hav
ing removed to Brooklyn.
Whit Wesley was four years old his
father, having a large and increasing
family, abandoned law for agriculture
and bought a farm at "Looking Glass
Prairie," near Bellville, Hi., not far
fr"iri St. Louis. Young Merritt at
tended the school of the Christian
Brothers, a Catholic institution, at Bell
ville. The Merritts were not of that
faith, but they sent the boy thither be
cause it was a good school. Later he
worked on the farm for three years,
helping his brothers raise corn and
pork, for which that section has always
been famous.
V ;nfr Merritt often drove the farm
team seventeen miles to town, getting
only 13 cents a bushel for his corn.
Everything a farmer produced in those
days was cheap as dirt, and there be
ing little money in circulation paste
board checks circulated in some local

.â¢â  -high. because it took so much corn. and
]â â¢>! k t." pay for it.
â â¢'.. Being a lawyer and a man of a lit
erary' turn of mind, the boy's father
aspired to do something besides rais
ing corn. He started a local evening
ipaper at Bellvllle, called the Ad
vocate, and later a weekly of the same
â¢ name at Lebanon. Both were Dougias

Democratic Journals of that day,
. were for territorial extension, the an
â¢''nexation of Texas and the settlement
Â«.if the vexed and formidable "Oregon
question." by taking possession of the
c&'untry clear to the Pacific Ocean.
'â¢ Young Merritt helped his father and
V '.brothers publish this kind of a Demo
cratic newspaper. He mastered the
DUsiness Of running a country newspa- j
per. taking his turn in looking after
petty details, besides learning to set
type and becoming an expert printer
while but a boy.
At the age of 16 he went to read law
in thp office of Judge Haynie in Salem.
He was making rapid progress when
i;overn<.r BiMell, then a member of
Congress, secured him a cadetshlp tor
VO-st Joint.
Said General Merritt to a Herald re
porter yesterday: "Up to that time T
had no Idea f >f becoming a soldier. My
ambition was to be a good lawyer and
politician, and enter public life. I be
]loved thai my forte lay in the direc
tion of discussion and public speaking.
However, when my father pointed out
the great advantages of a West Point
â¢ <lu<nti on, a careful consideration of
the subject in the light of his experi
ence and ari?uments convinced me of
his wisdom. I accepted his views and
entered West Point. At that particu
lar time the course of study at the
Military Academy was five years. I got
along v<Â»ry well. I did not stand .high
in- my Haas except In English. Was
Â»-ather slow in mathematics. I think I
was in the only full five-year class ever
â¢ graduated from that institution.
'Among my classmates were General
Horace Porter, General James H. Wil
son of Illinois, now of Delaware, and
the well-known 1 istorian. General John
M. Wilson, the present chief of engin
eers, and General S. V.. Cushing, just
retired as commissary general; a.so
General Stephen D. Kamseur of Siruth
Carolina. It is a singular fact that
having entered the Confederate army,
he was killed by my command at Win
chester. While he lay BQrtOUSly WOUnd
ed and dying, and very anxious to see
me, I was sent for. But, being in hot
pursuit of the enemy. It was impossible
for the messenger to reach me in tin;".
| I hurried back to Bee my wounded
classmate, but he was dead before I
arrived."
Genera! Merritt has no family. His
favorite nephew, Eaton Merritt, he is
educating at a Connecticut school,
with a view of sending him to West
Point. General Merritt was married in
1871, in Europe, to Miss Caroline W i
ren of Cincinnati. She died in 1893, at
St. Paul, and was buried at West Point,
where the general was superintendent
for five years.
The Merritts originally sprang from
three brothers, who came to America
in 1600, their descendants settling in
W.-stchester, and from that family, it
is said, all the Merritts born in this
country have descended.
Of General Merritt's military' his
tory much has been written. A mere
record of his battles, engagements and
campaigns would fill columns of The
Call. He had many narrow escapes
from death, a notable one at the battle
of Beverly Ford, in 1863, when he was
attacked by a Confederate officer, and a
desperate hand-to-hand contest fol
lowed. He was sabered over the head,
and wculd have been killed but for the
big soft felt hat which he wore, con
taining a big army pocket handker
chief. In this engagement he was sur
rounded and his troops nearly captured.
He fought with a courage and desper
ation ihat won a great victory. Th"
newspapers of the day were filled with
his exploits in that particular enc;i je
ment, and on the earnest recommen
dation of General Buford he wa/i made
a brigadier-general.
Perhaps the greatest ride of his life
was his famous dash through the
Rocky Mountains, when he rode night
and day to the rescue of Major Thorn
burgh's command, hemmed in by the
Ute Indians at the time of the White
River massacre. The soldiers were
surrounded and being slowly shot and
starved to death. A single man man
aged to crawl out one night and escape,
and after incredible suffering reached
Rawlings Station on the Union Pacific
Railroad, nearly two hundred miles to
the north.
A "hurry" telegram was sent to Gen
eral Merritt, then golonel of the Fifth
Cavalry at Fort D. A. Runseli, near
Cheyenne. After reaching Rawlings or
the nearest railroad point to the White
River Indian .agency, General Merritt
had to ride four days and nights con
tinuously with a light supply of food
and ammunition. Thornburgh was
dead and his men were on the point of
starvation, wounded and barely able to
cling to their guns behind their in
trenehments.
Merritt arrived at the break of day,
advanced with yells and scattered the
Indians, who were waiting like coyotes
for the soldiers to die or surrender.
GeneraT Merritt's wild ride through the
mountains will long challenge the re
cord. It is considered remarkable that
he did not kill a horse or a man dur
ing his mountain march.
With Custer, McPhcrson and Sheri
dan, Merritt was called one of the boy
eenerals of the war. Graduating from
West Point but a few months before

"In any event. I would have remained with my parents, for in such

Mrs. Williams, a handsome woman, with brilliant dark^brown eyes
and head crowned with snowy hair, was present and took* part In the
conversation.
"To those who know them both." she said, "the difference in age
means less than might be supposed. The general is youthful in his

"Years of travel and experience with people of many countries

Miss Williams said she had been a student of history, and knew a
good deal about the region which, in all probability, will be her home.
"Naturally," she said, "I have recently made a close study of the

nounce. The head of the administration
is the Philippines is :.e captain and
governor general, who resides at Ma
nila. Next to" the Governor of Cuba it
has been the most important and lucra
tive position at the disposal of the
Madrid Government. But these gover
nors have been the bject oi political
removal with every change of the Cabi
net, the official sometimes rer..aining in
office only a few months.
The church officials, the real rulers
of the country, generally remain in
power from decade to decade. In thirty
years there were but two archbishops.
The supremacy of the ecclesiastical
branch of the Government and uncer
tainty of political tenure, it is said, led
the office-holders to loot the treasury
and rob the peopk> remorselessly while
temporarily in power; hence the cor
ruption and oppression, ending in rev
olution.
Under the political system in the
Philippines the heads of departments
consider themselves fortunate if able
to keep their positions one-quarter of
the time allowed ecclesiastical officials
of a corresponding grade. There, as in
Spain, a Niagara of bombast and eocial
display is noticeable. It helps hide the
rottenness of the administration. The
titles alone of the Captain- General fill
a page, embracing all the attributes of
government except authority over the
fleet, which is subject to the Ministry
of Marine in Spain. The Captain-Gen
eral also has a limited jurisdiction in
church matters. If he dies the Lieu
tenant-Governor takes his place under
the title of "second head."
The Philippines are divided into prov
inces subject either to politico-military
governors or alcaldes mayores, who
usually are civilians. When the Gov
ernment is military an assistant Lieu
tenant-Governor, who must have grad
uated as a lawyer, exercises the pre
liminary jurisdiction, but the alcaldes
hold that jurisdiction in their own
own persons. Both dispose in their
provinces of the military authority,
and have the controlling direction of
collecting revenues, being responsible
to the general Administrator of Trib
utes.
Tne provinces are divided into pueb
los (towns or villages), oxner each of
which a native Indian or mestizo (half
breed) is placed, lie is called "Gov
ornor" â the little Governor â and as
sisted by native lieutenants and al
guacils, whose number is regulated by
the extent of the population. This body
â¢settles all matters of police and civil
questions between natives as to rights
of person and property.
In districts where the Chinese or
their descendants are sufficiently num
erous they are allowed by a special au
thority of the Government to select
delegates to this local body independ
ently of Indian jurisdiction. To a cer
tain extent this body (called Princlpalia
of the Pueblo) is representative and
more or less democratic. The members
are especially charged to assist the
clergy in all matters of public worship
and ecclesiastical authority. They de
termine questions involving amounts
less than forty-four silver dollars; they
collect evidence in # criminal cases,
which is submitted to the provincial
chief, and assist in the collection of the
royal revenues; circulate the ordi
nances of the Government among the
peopie, and last, but not least, are au
thorized to levy an alleged small but
specified contribution in support of
their office and their dignity.
Besides these, there are in every pu
eblo certain functionaries called Ca
bezas (heads) â the barangay. A baran
jray is a collection of the chief of
families or persons paying tribute, usu- â¢
ally amounting to forty or fifty In
number. They are under the charge of
the Cabeza, who must dwell among
them, and under bond collect the trib
ute due the state. He must settle dis
putes, maintain peace and order, and
collect taxes for payment to the "little
governor" of the pueblos. This Cabeza
also acts as the local lawyer of the
community. He has privileges, one of
which is to affix "Don" to his name,
and in some provinces he can hold of
fice for three years. The "little gov
ernors" of the pueblo are elected an
nually, and next to cock fighting it is
the supreme event of the year. There
are thirteen electors for each pueblo.
A province is ruled by a civil ecclesi
astical functionary. There are special
provisions and concessions allowed the
Chinese, who enter largely into the
population in some districts. As there
are thirty thousand or forty thousand
of the Chinese, they are no small fea
ture In the mixed population.
The chief end of all this machine/,
these local indulgences to the. rural
magnates, is to keep the tax mills
grinding out revenue for Spain. Taxes,
oppressive assessments, fines, for spltÂ«Â»
or revenge, and confiscation for th â¢-Â»
in rebellious protest are among the
many ways of swelling the vast fund
which has kept the Spanish crown
aloft for centuries. Spanish rulers are
supposed to know a good thing' at

Europeans these regions are the least

Dr. Me Gee has just been charged with the selection of all the war nurses for the Government during the present

is at tho head of what is called the Board of 'â¢Daughters." The other ladies on the board are Miss Mary Desha, Miss
Frances S. Nash ami Mrs. Amos G. Draper. Dr. McGee is the only member of the board possessed of medical train

women nurses for the war service, the
plans have just been changed, and Dr.
McGee is fast supplying women to take
care of our brave buys in the hospitals
at Key West, Atlanta and the hospital
ship lately fitted out at New York.
There were women nurses in the late
war, but they were not enlisted in the
military service, being paid from the
unofficial funds of the Sanitary Com
mission. They received but $12 a
month In reward for their tender ser
vices, whereas those who will nurse
the wounded of the present war will
get the full nurse's pay of $30 a month.

THE W OMAN WHO JUST BEEN
APPOINTED TO SELECT WAR NURSES
Mâ¦â¢ 4 I flrSt time 1Q ' ? United States women are being enlisted in the military service. Dr. Anita Newcomb McGee, a pa

can scientists, and is the wife of Pro
fessor W. J. McGee, the well-known
ethnologist and geologist. She is one
of the vice-presidents general of the
Daughters of the American Revolution,
having been previously elected sur
geon-general and librarian-general of
that society.
As soon as the present war was an
ticipated she conceived the idea of the
society co-operating with the War and
Navy Departments, and both Surgeon-
General Van Reypen of the navy and
Surgeon-General Sternberg of the army
indorsed the project. In consequence,
she received the appointment which she
now holds, being at the head of the
board of "Daughters" having the selec
tion of the war nurses in charge. The
other ladies of the board are Miss Mary
Desha, Mrs. Francis S. Nash and Mrs.
Amos G. Draper. Dr. McGee is the di
rector of the board, and being the only
member possessed of medical training,
performs the responsible duty of se
lecting eligible nurses from the hun
dreds of applicants.
Already 1500 women have volunteered
their services as war nurses, their let
ters being addressed to the President,
the Secretary of War, Secretary of the
Navy, and to various other high offi
cials. All of these applications, which
are now pouring in at the rate of about
100 a day, are turned over by the de
partments to Dr. McGee. who replies
by mailing blanks to be filled out and
returned to her.
Before they may be placed upon the
list of eligibles women applicants must
prove that they have been graduated
at reputable training schools for nurses.
They must be between the ages of
thirty and fifty, and it is preferred that
they have had practical experience, and
that they be without family ties. They
must be strong and healthy in order to
cope with the unusual hardships of a
military hospital.
Only surgiccl nurses are being called
for, since women trained in the care of
general diseases would have practically
nothing to do in wards filled with men
mangled by shot and shell. Although
during the last war Miss Djx, who per
formed the duties now conferred upon
Dr. McGee refused to appoint women
who were prepossessing in appearance,
no such regulation has been made for
this war, and our brave boys may hope
to be inspired to strength by woman's
comeliness as well as healed by her ten
der skill.
Great care is being: taken, however,
to select only women of the very high
est moral character, and to insure this
individual members of the Daughters
of the American Revolution are co-op
erating in all of the States. No one
will be appointed an "angel of mercy"
without the written indorsement of
some "daughter." Thus it will be seen
that women are managing the affair
entirely, and perhaps no other associa
tion of women could undertake such
responsibilities as the Daughters of the
American Revolution. numbering
twenty-five thousand members, scat
tered in all of the States.
There is a great demand for women
nurses who have had yellow fever and
who are immune from the disease, but
so far not a single one has been found.
Women of various nationalities are
making application, but only citizens
of the United States are accepted.
Trained colored r.urses have been
placed on the eligible list to be called
upon when needed.
COST OF THE PRESENT WAR
ANYBODY who thinks that war is a little diversion should
read the interesting reports of Chairman Dingley of th.9
House Ways and Means Committee in presenting his war
revenue measure.
He frankly admits that the expenses of the preparations
for defense made by the United States recently have been at the rate
of twenty-five million dollars per month, or three hundred million
dollars per year, and he adds the interesting statement that "the
expenses of actual war will bs much more."
The increase of the regular army from a peace basis of about 15,
000 men to a war basis of 60,000 enlisted men, and the increase
in the pay cf privates from $13 to $15 60 per month, with a corre
sponding increase in the pay of non-commissioned orflcers, shows
where a part of the money will go.
It is estimated that it will cost to feed the 60,000 regulars and
125,000 volunteers nearly $40,000 a day, or 20 cents per man.
This, of course, does not include the cost of arming, clothing and
equipping of the troops.
After the war has been fought and the victory won the victor
will have the right to claim an indemnity, but the question is
whether Spain would be in a position to pay us anything, in view of
the fact that its 4 per cents are selling at a little over 30, and it is
straining every nerve to raise the money necessary to carry on the
war. She may pay us by offering us some of her territorial posses
sions in the Atlantic.
In that event, unless we could sail these possessions for cash, our
war debt would be left unpaid and would be added to the existing
permanent obligation of the Government.
Government bonds have been the basis of the circulation of our
national banks, and the rapid payment of these bonds since the close
of the war led to fear that within a short period our banking sys
tem would need to be radically changed.
The present war will probably put an end to this fear, and also to
recent efforts to change the basis of security for the issue of national
banks.
Senator Hale said yesterday that he wished to put himself on
record by stating that should the war last a year it would cost
between seven and fight hundred million dollars.
Politics now enter into the Congressional discussions and
delays matters greatly.
As soon as the Senate took up the war revenue bill Hale
declared that the war would cost seven hundred millions or
eight hundred millions a year. Jones of Arkansas said that much
may be spent, but there was no necessity of spending over four
hundred million dollars. He said that the most extravagant esti
mates of the Secretaries of War and Navy would not exceed three
hundred million dollars a year, and they have replied that none
of the estimates were much more than half the actual cost.
The late war was never so expensive. No wars were so ex
pensive as those involving the sending of troops to other coun
tries.
These war nurses will be uniformed
in white dresses, caps and aprons. Each
will wear a badge in the form of a
red cross of enamel, surrounded by a
'circle of blue enamel. Upon the cross
will be inscribed "Hospital Corps," and
along the blue circle "Daughters of the"
American Revolution." Upon each
apron will be neatly stenciled the wheel
insignia of the Daughters of the Amer
ican Revolution.
Unless Spain disregards the treaty
signed by her, the United States and
sixteen other governments, in 1864,
whereby it was agreed that in all fu
ture wars the sick and wounded and Â
their attendants would be considered
as neutrals, -the. red cross badges worn
by these women will be' sufficient pro
tection against the enemy. The red
cross flags surmounting all of our hos
pitals, whether they be general, field
or floating, must be as strictly respect
ed during the war as though they were
flags of truce, and any attempt against
the safety of any one protected thereby
would be frowned upon by every en
lightened nation of the world.
No women nurses will be sent to-
Cuba. If any are delegated to field
hospitals they will do service only in
this country- Of course, none will be
permitted aW>ard any of the naval ves
sels, since the gentler sex are forbidden
quarters on all ships in action. Speak
ing of naval nurses, it may be of in
terest to add that Congress must make '
some appropriation before any nurses,
male or female, may be appointed as
such. Some male nurses have been en- '
listed in the navy as ship's cooks, that
they may draw the nurse's salary whilo
performing his duties. No woman will
be taken aboard the naval hospital
ship Solace.
Dr. McGee will take pains that her
corps may be the best equipped woman
war nurses ever employed. When the
Civil War broke out there wasn't :i
trained nurse in the country to answer
the call of the Sanitary Commission,
whose nurses were mostly women who
had simply practical experience in hos
pitals or at home. Almost every large
rity, especially of the North, now
boasts of several training schools for
nurses.
Twenty-five nurses will be attached
to each regiment in the field, and if all
of these nurses are to be graduates of
training schools a great many of them
must be women. Many of the women
â¢who have already volunteered are doc
tors of medicine willing to perform any
duties, and some are sisters of charity.
Rev. Dr. Alvah Hovey has resigned
the presidency of the Newton (Mass.)
Theological institution (Baptist), his
resignation to take effect on the Ist of

AIMS AND OBJECTS OF THE RED CROSS,
BY MRS. WILLARD B. HARRINGTON. Presider>t California Red Cross Society.
THE war with Spain will no doubt increase the public stock of geographical and other information much
more rapidly than such knowledge is acquired in times of peace. Perhaps none of that is more valu
able and interesting than that in reference to the Red Cross.
The American National Red Cross, incorporated under the laws of the United States for the Dis
trict of Columbia, js the sole legitimate and recognized head branch in the United States of the great in
ternational association, of which the International Committee of Berne. Switzerland, is the head.
By the terms of the Geneva Convention of 1864 the participants of the agents of the Red Cross in
the active ambulance and hospital service of the United States is effected through the express neutralization
of its individual workers by the military and naval authorities.
Its assistance, however, is not limited to this individual employment or its agents in the field; it
stands ready to co-operate in the equipment and supply oi ambulances and medical stores, drawing for its
resources on the benevolence of the community and systematizing effort and aid throughout the country
by the various local societies organized under its auspices and rules.
In short the Red Cross represents the highest form of intelligent, non-sectarian effort for the relief
of human suffering on the field of battle regardless of the nationality of the victims, or of what flag they
may fight under.
This is to be the work of the California Red Cross Society and its branches in San Francisco and
elsewhere in the State, the State Society being in affiliation with the American National Red Cross.

at hand. Then the policemen ordered
spectators out and put up a rope bar
rier in front of the wide entrance, and
we girls each clutched a long-stemmed
in one hand and a handkerchief in
the other and â waited.
Ah, but wasn't it fine to hear the
music coining nearer and nearer, and
see the crowds of people outside with
their faces all turned in one direction,
and hear the policemen ordering them
here and there, and feel the air full of
something throbbing and surging like
the very life of our bodies?
And then they came! First the band
with the crash and blare and shock
of brass and tense beaten parchment,
through which the patriotic melody
found its way to our very hearts: and
then the men marching in, dusty and
travel-worn, tramp, tramp, tramp,
until the wide, low room was packed
with them, and everybody but the sol
diers themselves shouting and cheer
ing and waving lilies and handker
chiefs and hats and any old thing that
came to hand.
Perhaps you won't believe it. but
after my throat cracked bo that I
couldn't get out another s*iund and
my wrists ached so that I just had to
stop waving things. I looked about and
saw one of the most dignified and
highly cultured full-blown buds of Â«ur
set standine up in a chair frantically
waving a dishcloth In one hand and an
ir. -n spoon in the other and screaming
like a lunatic, and. to tell the truth, I
just wanted to hug her.
And then we fed them.
We had great hugger-mugger boil
ers full of hot stew and hotter coffee,
and we ladled the stew out into tin,
plates and put an eschallot and a tin
spoon into each one and took a cup of
coffee in the other hand and went oat
into the crowd and came back again
and repeated the performance until
everybody was supplied with the first
course, and then we took the heavily
laden baskets and carriel them about
and saw that every single soldier had
not only what he wanted to eat then
and there, but that his pockets and
knapsack and even his tin cup were
packed with fruit and cake and sand
wiches in case Uncle Sam kept him
waiting for his lunch.
Then Mr. Stetson climbed up cm a
chair and started the cheering. We
Red Cross members followed his lead
in cheering our guests, squealing shril
ly as jvomen always do when they
mean to hurrah, and following the
outburst with a "tiger." which was a
white kitten so far as ferocity went,
but was the very best we could do
with the voices at our command.
And then we all cheered together for
Dewey and Sampson and the Presi
dent, and then the soldier boys gave
a round of cheers for the Red Cross
that shook the very wharf and sent
me out of the crowd into the deserted
store-room to weep a little weep all by
myself as they fell into line again and
marched out amid a chorus of good
bys and good wishes.
Someway all I could think of just
then was the gladiators' greeting and
farewell, "morituri salutemus." and it
all came over me with a rushâ the
bravery and the glory c-f it all.
Just think of it! Men taking their
lives in their hands and leaving home
and friends to fight for us stay-at
homes, not because they must, but be
cause they choose.
Ah. but it is grand! And when you
think of those murdered soldiers on
the Maine and the starving Cubans,
and Admiral Dewey. and our own
California boys going across the
ocean. Well. I cant talk about it: I
can't even bear to think about it â but
I can be a Red Cross worker all my
life if I am needed, and I will.

HENRI MAURICE CANNON, the fat man of Europe, Is in this city. He
claims not only to be the heavy-weight of Europe, but challenges the
nations of the world to produce a man who can tip the beam at any
where near his weight, which is 613 pounds, lie Is here for the money
there is In it and brings his wife along, for he has to have some one to
lace up his shoes. There is a marked contrast between the physique of Herr
Cannon and that of his faithful nuouse. He is a regular human Jumbo In size,
while she looks more like a slip of a school girl than the wife of a fat
man. Herr Cannon is nothing great considered longitudinally; It is in his meas
urements latitudinally that he excels. He is only 5 feet 10V 2 inches between the
north and south poles, but at his equator he measures 96 inches. He has a
chest development of 70 inches, his thigh measures 54 inches and his leg i 340
inches at the calf.
Herr Cannon was born in Switzerland some 48 years ago. His mothep is a
normal sized woman, while his father weighs 300 pounds. He has an elder
brother who is something of a fat man on his own account. For a time It was
nip and tuck between the brothers as to which could take on flesh the faster.
The brother got to 380 pounds easily enough, but there he stuck and could not
gain another pounfl, while Maurice kept on growing as though he had inherited
the flesh of the whole family. From the time when he turned the 600-pound
mark he has never fallen below it. The most he has ever weighed is 621 pounds,
and when he gets down to 609 pounds he considers himself a light weight. Last
Monday be weighed just 613 pounds, but that was just after a trip across the
continent. His usual weight is about 618 pounds.
Strange to say Herr Cannon is quite active on his feet and can walk all day
providing that he keeps on the dead level. To travel either up hill or down winds

morning, and as to appetite he would surprise a boarding-house keeper, not in
the great amount tnat he can eat, but in the diminutive portion that satisfies
Inn.
In his younger days and his native country he held the position of brewer
ios inspector, and in those days could drink two gallons or more of beer daily.
Since that he has sojourned In France and developed into a wine drinker. He
takes a quart bottle of red or white wine with each meal, but never a dron be
tween times.
He landed in New York March 27 and in San Francisco May 29. He
likes America better than Europe, and for several reasons. In Kurope he has
' to travel in a freight car, as the compartments in the passenger cars are not
designed for human Jumbos. In America he finds no difficulty in traveling, ex
. cept with the hackmeh, as he occasionally breaks down a hack and there Is the
"deuce" and dollar to pa'-. He says that American tailors plea#e him best.
What impresses him most is that when he calls in a tailor the American one
says nothing, but goes about his work as though making clothes ; for fat i men
were an every-day occurrence, whereas, the European tailor â  comes in, takes a
look at Herr Cannon, holds up his hands in horror, goes away and j promises to
come back, ; but does hot. What's more, the American tailor delivers the clothes
at the time agreed. Herr Cannon has not as yet had occasion to experiment with
the skill and veracity of the American shoemakers. :/ - V. ; ;
Herr Cannon does not object to the attention he attracts as a fat man pro
viding people pay for it, but he does object; to making a free show of him
self. He travels on his .ape. It is his stock in trade, and for this reason he
privately lives a very secluded life. ; , He is not a big eater. Two chops or a small
- steak constitutes his ', breakfast, a'? light [ lunch and a dinner ; that would only
make a fair lunch ; for a workingman is the dally . meal ticket routine of Herr
Cannon. .He has never : been sick a day in his life, ' and ': has therefore never
called in a physician. However, his case has always attracted the attention of
physicians and ' any number have 'called on him. Many have attempted to diag

' effectual, absurd bets they make, know
every motive that goes to make up the
harmony of the coursing. For their

admiration, the kind of admiration

; who, by the way, are always just one
step in advance in intelligence and in

There are two ways of looking at

j and the downstairs.

lunch baskets; children going about
with half-devo red sandwiches; older
boys and girls che . ing gum, and the
trail of sticky popcorn and empty pea
nut shells is over it all. Upstairs you'd
almost think that these thousands of
people had spent from an hour to an
hour and a half reaching this their
goal for the purpose of seeing a patent,
highly elastic, lightning-like forty or
fifty pounds of dog overtake a small,
fuzzy, bewildered bunch of hare.
"I like to come out here and lobk at
the sport," said a fresh-faced, slim
woman, "after being shut up all the
week in the store. My old man, he'd
like to bet; but I told him that he'd
have to wait till I'd got my Easter
dress before he did any more betting.
His moneys earned too hard to' be lost
this way. So I told him I wouldn't come
out here unless he'd give me the money
to keep."
Downstairs, though, there is no delu
sion as to the attraction of the cours
ing park. It's that old, unreasoning,
deathless desire to wager and to win
that filled i.iark Twain's jumping frog
with shot in the immortal Calaveras
tale. Just to bet; that's all these eager
eyed men and women, with their lined
faces and alternations of hope and de
spair, crave. To bet; it doesn't make
any difference, apparently, to them
whether they bet one way or the other.
"Say, let's each chip in a half and
bet on Susie! What do you say?" a
frowsy woman, with more gold In her
teeth than In her pocket, asked another
woman.
"Why," said the shrewd little body
that carried the fa; lly purse, "Susie's
five to one â or six to one."
"No she ain't. I just heard him
shout one to five. Will you chip in?"
But the woman wh > wants her Eas
ter dress shook her head. "My old man"
had been deprived of the delight <5f bet
ting; it wouldn't be fair for his old
woman to allow herself that pleasure
to-day.
But another woman, who didn't want
an Easter dressâ though, it was only
too apparent how badly she needed
one â Joined the first speaker, who dis
appeared in the crowd about the bet
ting stand. But she came back, re
gretfully, and handed back the half
dollar, saying:
"She was right. It ain't one to five.
It's five to one."
"I thought so," said somebody's "old
woman." "Why, Susie's just the pick
of 'em. I tell you," she went on ex
citedly, forgetting her resolution, "if
Susie was one to five, I'd put up five
dollars on her."
"You think I'm going to put up five
dollars to win one," said the frowsy
woman, the lust of wagering in her
eye. "I'll tell you what we'll do. Let's
all put in a quarter apiece. Just for
fun! Huh? What d'ye say? We won't
lose much â an'," she laughed nervous
ly, "we won't make much."
"That Van Cloie's a good dawg," said
a stout Irish woman, with the frank
est brogue and the unfrankest eyes â
ajl awry and crossed. "Susie's a burrd;
but that Van Cloie ain't no fool."
So the modest pool was formed and
the Irish woman marched off to breast
the waves of male gamblers clashing
themselves and their dollars against
the rocks of the pool sellers.
"Say, better watch her," whispered
one of the mighty syndicate. "Per
haps she'll get away with the money.
D'ye know her?"
"No, do you?" asked the frowsy wo
man, a suspicious gleam coming in her
own eye as she spoke.
Not one of the four knew another.
But the Irish woman came back with
the magic pink card, which a small,
well-dressed member of the corporation
seized immediately and held.
I wonder If by any chance fleet Susio
had been beaten by her rival, whether
there would have been war in the Van
Cloie syndicate? She wasn't, of course.
There was no possibility of such a
thing, according to the woman who
knows so much of coursing and of hu
man nature, that she keeps her hus
band's purse in her own pocket. But
these women are mad to bet. If not one
] way, then in the name of all that's su
perstitious and miraculous, on the
other.
They take defeat philosophically,
I though. All except the old li-ish wo
j man, who turned pugnaciously to her
neighbor and demanded:
"Didn't ye see that Van CV>ie got.
it? He did, I tell ye. An' that judge's
"rooked, or I can't see straight."
As she possibly can't with such eyes
as hers, one must conclude that Judge
Bull, mounted on his pretty brown
steed, brave in his pink coat and tight
white, short trousers, his Jaunty high
hunting boots and scarlet cap is as
fair, as honest a Judge as ever graced
the center of a coursing sward.
But the tragedies of the Coursing
Park succeeded each other so closely
that the woman who bets hasn't time
to dry her tearsâ her figurative tears,
for though her face becomes lined and
set, she is good gambler enough never
to break down over one loss before
she must nerve herself to face another
probably.
Here's a white-haired woman, angu
lar, tall, with a parchment-like face.
Her bonnet is old-fashioned arid old,
her coat of sealette is too narrow across
the. shoulders and in its dead dinginess
looks a protest against being still com-
pelled to live a coat's life, Instead of
being consigned to the repose of the
old-clothes cemetery, or the honorable
oblivion of the rag-bag crematory. Her
poor, old trembling hands are covered
with cloth gloves, and just now they
are counting out money enough into a
tout's outstretched palm to partly re
habilitate her dingy wardrobe.
"Yes," she says, in answer to an in
quiring glance. There are no sdcial
barriers out at the Coursing Park.
One touch of nature â the searing brand
of avarice â has made them all kin.
"Yes, I lost again. I don't see how.
I really don't see," she shakes her
miserable old head stupidly, "how I
didn't win."
"Why the race was the 'Buck's' hands
down," said a red-faced, husky-voiced
man behind. "Ye'd ought to know
that."
But she didn'tâ that, or anything
else. And when the book-makers be
gan again to shout hoarsely, they kept
a wise, wary eye over to the corner
where the women were congregated in
desperate knots, knowing that here
were fish that would rise to the scant
iest bait, the most apparent of hooks.
"Todâ Todâ Tod," a woman was
moaning, rising ecstatically upon her
toes and falling back again upon her
heels, praying if ever human creature
prayed with mind and body intent upon
one thing.
But Tod was beaten and she slipped
out of the crowd, determinedly making
her way to the betting stand again.
But now the Plunger had joined the
crowd; the woman in half-masculine
attire and wholly masculine uncon
sciousness of embarrassment or lack
of ease In the howling crowd of betting
men.
There is no necessity for introduc
tion. These women meet week after
week at one track or the other.
"Let me see," she says, reaching out
a plump white hand; she has removed
her gloves and tipped her mannish hat
back from a pretty forehead marked
with a red rim. "Let me see how they
stand. I've lost mine."
With a practiced eye she glances
over the carefully kept book, where
second ties and third ties and fourth
ties are religiously noted down mark
ing: the gradual elimination of the
beaten hounds. She hands It back
with a sigh.
"Ain't you betting?" they ask her
'V\hy," she says pouting, "I lost $20
on Miram.mte."
"Ye shouldn't bet bo much Ye
shouldn't bet $20 on wan race. 'Taint
right," said the Irish woman, folding
her hands with disapproving gravity
under her gray shawl.
"But you can afford it." said the
white-haired woman enviously, her
shaking hands fumbling in her black
bag.
The Plunger liked this. The envy of
other women, even of old battered
women such as this one. was welcome
to her. She smiled saucily. She
wouldn't for the world have denied
what her well-made clothes said so
plainly.
"But, you see," she said, "I lost the
other twenty, too. That makes forty
to-day. A friend ofymine's looking for
some one now to cash a check for me.
If it was out at Ingleside, now, they
all know me thereâ but hereâ l can't
get a check cashed."
She moved away, walking along con
fident, the light of business solely in
her eye. She was thinking as she left
the crowd of bettors regretfully of the
chance to bet and the difficulty of get
ting credit when one is unknown. The
other women looked after her, sighing

enviously. She was what they would
like to be.
I looked in vain up stairs or down
for a woman who would consider the
case of the harep.
The doggy woman differs from the
horsey one in many respects. She is
not nearly so well dressed, for one
thing. There is no style at Union
Park, no fiauntir- of fine feathers. She
is a maid in somebody's kitchen or she
works in a shop very often. She brings
the babies with her, too; an odd place
for babies. The father of the family,
becoming seized with the betting ma
niaâand lacking that treasure of
wives "My old man" possesses â elbows
his way through the betting crowd,
the latest flower rf the family perched
u- on his shoulder, and lays down his
dollars upon the altar of Chance, while
young Hopeful from his elevated perch
is in a position to see and be impressed
by the edifying spectacle.
The woman who kncvrs about dogS
looks not like a drone, not like a
queen bee, either, but like a worker.
But in her earnestness, in her devotion,
to the betting book, in her desire to
overreach somebody, in her excited de
termination to win, si. 's own sister to
the woman wh>se patter about jockeys
and horses corresponds to the foreign
! tongue in which they communicate
ideas out at the coursing park.
These downstairs women are perfectly
unconscious of any and of every thing
but the fluctuation of the gambling
market. Those flying bunches out in
the field, now shooting swiftly ahead,
now bounding over the ground in the
last muscle-straining effort to escape,
might be suffering the most exquisite
of tortures and these women would
continue to bet their sesterces on th^ir
blood. They simply become so one
ldead that when you attempt to turn,
their minds on the hare question they
look at you almost uncomprehendingly
for a moment be ore they become im
patiently conscious that this has noth
ing to do with the business of the day.
Upstairs, I believe, the women would
as willingly watch mechanical toys
scuttling over the sward, with the
hounds tearing after them, if nature
had endowed greyhounds with as keen
a distaste of flying automata, as they
have for bunched-up, quivering, doub
ling, panic-stricken, flying hares.
From the two pretty girls, violetÂ«
bedecked, who walk up and down in
their light-gray jackets, dark skirts
and premature white sailors, to the old
woman in the sealette cloak, whose
face is a wrinMed mask; from the cold
eyed, red-faced, husky-voiced "lover of
sport'" to the spoiled, flaxen-haired
three-year-old, who shrieks and stamps
till his worthy mamma lifts him to his
old position, his arms and chubby legs
curled about a post above the fence im
mediately surrounding the course,
there is â not a deliberate cruelty, but
a complete unconsciousness that the
thing is cruel. They will tell you out at
the coursing park that there is no more
speedy, no more merc'ul death than
that the hounds inflict.

THRILLING ADVENTURES OF A UNION SPY ON SPECIAL SECRET SERVICE
Just before the Vicksburg campaign General Grant selected Sergeant William W. Jefforcis and nineteen other men to go inside the Confed
erate line and gather all the valuable information possible. The mission, just at that particular juncture, was fraught with such extraordinary
danger, that the men were given two hours to think over the matter, and then withdraw from the expedition if they entertained the slightest
hesitation. Jeffords says that in his two hours of silent deliberation he almost sweat blood as his mind reviewed the dangers that were known to
await them. All the twenty men reported they would go. Four of them were caught by the Confederate- and hanged as spies and several of them
â \Vere shot while trying to run the lines. Jeffords assumed the character of a deaf and dumb peddler and walked straight up to the Confederata lines.
He was- halted, and from that moment until the time he left the lines he was kept under a constant series of tests, for every new party of soldiers
:be met ' Suspected him. The shrewdness and boldness displayed by the Confederates to throw him off his guard was only surpassed by "his wonder
â  ful self-possession during the trying ordeals. For his success on this expedition Jeffords was made a first lieutenant. Below will be found the
; story, of his thrilling adventures as he tells them himself.

â â ;, General Grant planned to face the
t&rp â¢ Confederate armies in detail and
defeat* them before they could unite
', against him. He wished to know a lot
of facts about the Confederate fortifi
, cations â¢in the gaps of the Red Rock
.Ridge, and the size of Johnston's re
enforcements. â¢ Spies were necessary,
a'nd'at this time I was called upon to
do spy service.
Â I. had 'done a little spy work in the
P.orffJ-ibson campaign, but this job in
Johnston's camp. Colonel Raymond
told.-me,- .was about the most dangerous
that any " spy could undertake. The
two armies were almost ready to
fight each" other any day, and all the
camps were unusually watchful of un
known / civilians. Colonel Raymond
said he wanted twenty young men who
had nerve, and who would go into the
enemy's lines, ready to die, if necesary,
without whimpering or divulging of se
crets. He also informed me that sev
eral' Confederate spies had been recent â >
ly hanged, at Corinth, and that the
\, enemy, -would surely retaliate on Fed
eral -spies.
I was given two hours to think the
proposition over. I was left in a room
and -not : allowed to speak to any of
my- comrades.
I confess, I almost perspired blood
as I sat there alone that lovely May
moralrfg, and thought over the horrible
risk I was going to take. But I agreed
to go. -â  ' .
Colonel -Raymond told me that Gen
eral Grant wished to talk with the
men wjio were to go as spies. The
colonel led us about half a mile away
to a dilapidated house where Grant
made â¢his temporary headquarters.
General Grant left a table full of maps
and drawings and came to speak with
us in the yard. He explained that we
had been chosen because o-f our repu
tation for coolness, nerve and daring.
)i>\ rold us that if any of us had any
hesitancy or doubt of our courage in
engaging in the spy work in a region
and at a time wjien we wouid be sum
manly if caught, that one
shc-uld decline the service then and
there.
That afternoon each of us was in
structed in the particular information
aa to get, and the respective part
he was to play as a civilian in the
â n'-my's camp.
I was, given the task of observing
- >me topographical facts and seeing

had. I was instructed t<> be a deaf
mute. The Burgeon on General Grier
lon'a staff had been the head of a deaf

rpent several hours in drilling me as a

I was to go over to Jackson with a
'â¢ltrhel full of shoe blacking, shaving
("Up, paper collars and notions, appar
ently earning my livelihood by selling
iiy wares to Confederate soldiers. A
pencil and slate were my mode of com
munication.
I started out from the Grand Gulf
ate on the night of May 5. I knew
li.tt I would be suspected of being a
> ipy and that the least indication that
ny hearing was at all good would for
'eit my life.
I wap with!:: *h* enemy's lines by
Â»oor th*: next day. 'i atÂ« ur>de: a cow
j-hed while the rain drizzled down.
In the afternoon I was going along
a road near a hamlet known as Griess
bys. 1 heard a troop of cavalry coming
down the road behind me. I put on a
blank expression and trudged along
with my black satchel over my shoul
der.
A lieutenant rode up to me and
called:
"Hello here, where you going?"
1 had had time to prepare myself for
this test. I started as if at the ap
pearance of thÂ« horse under my eyes,
and looked vacantly up at the cavalry
man.
He repeated his question. In a second
I had my pocket slate out and handed
it courteously to the officer. The others
in the troop laughed and said:
"Oh, he's a d fool dummy."
The lieutenant wroie on nay slate,
"Who are you and where are you go
ing?"
I wrote that I was Daniel Freeman
and that I was peddling for a living.
Several of the troops remarked that it
was foolish to waste time on such a
dumb mutton-head as I, for I'd be
caught anyhow and the troop galloped
away.
I saw a camp of fully 1000 Confeder
ates down in a valley. I knew that my
presence woulu be reported at head
quarters by the cavalrymen and it
would be folly to go past a camp if I
were really seeking trude. I was
stopped by a sentinel about the camp.
I wrote for him my -ame and business
on my slate. He growled something
about lunk-head dummies wandering
about in war time and catching me by
the coat sleeve kd me to the officer of
the guard. The sentinel explained that
I was deaf and dumb and went away.
The officer had evidently known that
the role of dummy was not uncommon
with up-to-date spies. "Stand over
there a second, till I finish this." said
he to me in the most artful, off-hand,
easy manner.
My knees did move slightly and I al
most stepped a foot.
But I caught myself while the cold
chills chased up and down my spine at
my almost forgetfulness, and I re
solved not to risk my neck so easily
again.
"Your hard is bloody," said he, turn
ing carelessly to me. I stood liko a
post, looking vacantly at him.
Some of the cavalrymen I had sco n
on the road came in, and I knew from
the expression on the officer-of-tlv -
guard's face that I was to be tested for
my deafness. I stood indifferent to my
environment, looking at a picture on
the wall, while I knew that some test
of my hearing was being prepared at
my rear.
Suddenly one of the cavalrymen drew
his sword and shouted: "Gâ â d d n
this Yankee; I've a good mind to put
him to the wall right here!"
"Stab the !" cried another.
Fancy how you would feel to hear
such vords shouted in your oars by a
g*eat a burly and armed cavalryman in
an enemy's camp. I can't describe my
feelings, but I never blinked. I stood
scrutinizing the print picture on the
wall.
I knew that my every muscle and
nerve was being watched by every ore
in the apartment. The least twitch
or. turn of the head would have be
trayed me.
"He's about as dumb as they make
'em," said the offlcer-of-the-guard,
when it was seen how oblivious I was
to all their t.-sts of niy hearing. "Isn't
it strange that such a poor cuss should
po peddling around the fines of war
fare. He'll get over the Yank lines
and it'll gg f > hard with him some of
these days."
I was dismissed. I went peddling
about the camp, all the time keeping
my eyes open for topographical and
armament information.
Two days later I was seven miles
farther in the enemy's country. I had
met hundreds of Confederate soldiers
on the way, but the fact that I had
passed an outlying camp all right was
an indication that I was a genuine fool
dummy.

hourly simple tests of my hearing, or
father my non-hearing faculty.
I was almost on the verge of nervous
prostration fr<>m the strain of ceaseless
precaution I had to exercise lest I re
veal my hearing.
I was Btanding in the door of a
shanty cookhouse in a camp, and,
without a moraenVs warning down
came about five gallons of cold water
ever my head and shoulders. I shud
der now when I think how near I came
to cussing thr Confederate soldiers who
stood about to watch me.
Instead of saying a word I gurgled a
lot of inharmonious sounds' of fright,
and looked the more like a thing of
wood.
In another camp I was squatting on
the ground, mechanically showing my
Boape and tobaccos, and playing deaf
to the thousand and one questions art
fully put to me, when I saw by a sol
dier's eye that some test of my hearing
was to be made.
That moment I heard the click of a
pistol being brought to cock. The
weapon was discharged within three
inches of my ear.
I never had to hold myself together
more than then. I slowly turned my
head and looked inquiringly about at
the smoke of the discharge.
When I reached General Johnston's
main camp about Jackson, I knew that
crucial tests would be made. I had
by that time gained nearly all the In
formation I wished for General Grant,
and my plans were how to get back to
the Federal lines. *
I slept In a barn one night, remote
from any camp, where I could have at
least partial peace from the fear of
soldiers watching to entrap me to my
death. It is marvelous that I was not
stark mad by that time. The next
morning as I was getting out of the
barn I saw several infantry soldiers out
foraging. My actions had roused their
suspicions.
I wrote on my slate that I was a
Confederate peddler named Freeman
on my way to Jackson to get new
goods for selling to the boys in gray.
â¢ "Oh, that won't do." said one of the
soldiers. "I'll bet he's another Yank
spy."
Then I learned from the conversation
of my captors that two of the spies
sent out from Grand Gulf at the time
I was had been caught and hanged two
days previous.
Try and imagine what my. thoughts
were as the soldiers marched me across
a cotton field to the headquarters. In
my , four years of warfare that was the
nearest I ever \ saw death I before me.
It seemed perfectly hopeless to brave
out the ordeal I would have to undergo
in the enemy's lines, without a pass
in my pocket and no one to vouch for
me.' \-2^r"'
I was taken to General Klrby Smith's
tent: â¢ The general was informed that
I had been arrested without a pass, and
that I was suspected of being a spy in
the guise of a deaf and dumb peddler.
General Smith said: nothing.
Two or three officers in his tent went
and whispered, to ; him. . : I knew they
were devising schemes to catch me if I
were a spy in dlseuise. .
I â¢ pulled . myself together and i ; looked
absently about, as if I "had never seen
the interior of a tent in time of war
fare. I "knew that I was thoroughly
suspected by ' all present.
One of the I officers \ wrote me a mes
sage on a bit of : paper. While I : was
writing an answer, the man started and
ejaculated, "Look out!" â¢
. . I wonder now that .my hand .did not
- start involuntarily. The officers and
others were looking, at it closely. \

Then they trkd to make me pale,
and it was a frightful test.
I was given a seat while General
Smith turned to other business, appar
ently forgetful of me. The other offi
cers sat near me and smoked and chat
ted. Presently they - began talking
about some new orders that had been
issued to hang every Federal spy im
m"d lately upon conviction. They
talked about how two spies, that had
been hanged two days previous, had
acted as they squirmed in death, and
how the officers were locking for more
spies to hang on the same spot. My
brain was In a whirl. Everything swam
before my eyes, but I sat with my face
turned up to the military diagrams
and rules of camp on the tent wall be
fore me.
More whispering followed. I wrote
on my slate: "I am hungry and tired.
Why do yc-u keep me here?"
A colonel wrote: "We think you are
deceiving us. If you are, it will be
death to you." He watched my face
as I read the lines.
I wrote in reply: "I have a very hard
time getting a living in this war. I am
with the Confeds with all my soul.
Please may I go."
In an hour I was taken to a shanty
like affair and locked in. A young man
in Federal uniform was lying on the
floor when I entered. He rose, and
looking at me, said, "My g(X)dness gra
cious, have they got you, too?"
I looked vacantly at him. I wrote
that I was mute.
Then the stranger laughed and said:
"Oh, it won't do- you any good to keep
that trick up longer. We're going to
die together as Union spies, and why
not be resigned to it. I was caught
day before yesterday, and I've been
sentenced to be hanged. Now they'll
wait for you to go with me. Ha, ha,
we'll show the Rebs how Yankee buys
can die game, won't we?"
It was a trying moment, and I did
want to open my heart and mouth to
such a Jolly Federal man, while my
case seemed pretty hopeless. I could
not tell what opinion the men at Gen
eral Smith's headquarters had formed
of my actions.
I wrote on my slate that I was a
mute, and that it was useless to try to
communicate with me except by signs
or writing. But the stranger talked
right along, and tried to appeal to my
love for the Union cause. He would
suddenly fling a very natural question
at me.
Worn out and helpless as I was, I
dared not doze even for a second that
night. I knew my companion was
feigning sleep also.
Along in the middle of the night when
I was purposely breathing deep and
regularly I heard some one enter. It
was pitch dark. I was all attention
but still breathing deep. I heard a pis
tol drawn from its holster. Crash, bang!
The weapon was fired an inch above my
face. It seemed as if lightning had
struck me.
At the same moment a dark lantern
was flashed in my face and my coun
tenance studied.
I slowly opened my eyes at the light
and rolled over as if to go to sleep.
Th-; pseudo-Union soldier went out
with the Confederates. 1 could hear
them whispering about me and what
reason there was to suspect me as a
spy.
At 7 o'clock next moraine I was led
to the cook tent and given meal. My
satchel was restored to me. A colonel
came and shook me by the hand. He
looked over my few remaining soaps,
etc., and bought a little. Then turning
to me he asked: "How much are these?"
I believe my lower jaw did move. I
was caught off my guard for a trice.
But I never s nke and the colonel was
not looking at my face.
He wrote me a pass in the lines about
Jackson and just as he handed it to
me he turned and said: "Let me see
that again." My hand almost moved
to obey such an agreeable gentleman.
But instead I folded the paper and
started on my way out of camp, know
ing that I was watched covertly by
scores of eyes.
That day I replenished my satchel In
.Tackson and started back by a circuit
oup road toward the Federal lines. I
had no further bothjer from the Con
federates and my gifts of tobacco to
several officers whom - met made me
friends.
I reached Grand Gulf at dawn on May
11. I was thanked for the information
I had sot for my army and a month
later I was first lieutenant in my com
pany.
Of the twenty men who went as spies
at that time four were captured and
three were hanped. One man was shot
dead by a sentinel.
I was in Nashville. Term., in 1888 and
I called upon Colonel Jason Parker.
who was on General Smith's staff and
who devised the attempts to catch me
napping in my role as a dummy
peddler. He recalled the circumstances
clearly and we became fast friends. He
said he was cock-sure when I started
away from General Smith's headquar
ters that I was a genuine deaf mute
and he had felt sorry for me in my
affliction.

THE SERGEANT OF THE GUARD.
CORP HEALY rose when the second bottles of beer
had been opened, commanded silence and leaned
his fingers on the little table of Mother Revoll's
kitchen in the manner of an accustomed after
dinner speaker.
"Yell azcuse me bowldniss." said he, "but oi'm

"Hear! hear!" cried the newly made sergeant, patting
his mother's wrinkled hand, a hand of a boiled looking
white from much laundry work in the old troop.
"Good boy,* Healy:" cried old Fin Strait, the farrier.
"Wait till 1 got a pencil to report that speech."
"Ye're-an ignorant ould blatherskite, Fin; yez couldn't

"Hear: hear:" old Fin croaked. "I'm no orator like
Healy, Mrs. Revel!, because I've nothin" to say. Only
We're here to wet Martin's stripes, so we'll open another
bottle to his health. He was a bugler when he was 10 and

before you." â¢
"Achoo!"
Healy was seized with an attack of pnrezing. po that
he buried his face in his handkerchief. Little Mother
Revell's tanned and wrinkl.d face whitened and she
looked reproachfully at the farrier with big. pray, sor
rowful eyes. Fin himself turned red and opened several
_ bottles of beer in his confusion.
"And I'll bet my father made a good one." said the
young sergeant. "Eh, mother? You never tell me much
about him."
"It was so long- ago, dear," the laundress" answered In
a whisner.
There came a rap on the door, peremptory and offi
cial, and Martin rose and opened it. 'letting into the room
a shi\>r-compclling gust of wind and a whirl of snow.
"Halloa. Seddon!" he cried. "What's up? Come in!"
A snow-bespattered orderly, coated and befurred, en

"With the major's compliments to Mrs. Revell." he
said formally, "and he knows when stripes should be

The orderly grinned and placed two bottles of wine on
the table aiTl dashed '"'in again to resume nis post at the
house of the major commanding.
Tears sprang- to Mother Re,vell's eyes, and her son
reddened with pleasure.
"How kind of the old major!" she said. "He's been
a good friend to me. To think he should remember your
promotion. Martin."
"Ah, it's you he remembers, mother." cried Martin.
"Do you think he forgets how you nursed him when the
Apaches gave him that bullet in the ribs?"
"Faith." Healy muttered, "an' maybe he moinds fur

"Healy!" cried Mother Revell, nervomAy.
"Mam." said the long-legged, red-haired corporal,
'shall I be afther opentn' B bottle of wine?"
"Is it shampeen?" cried the farrier, excitedly, "or
maybe sherry wine?"
"Pass me the bottle. Fin. ay ye pleate," said Healy,
"an* oi'll be afther tellin' yez. It's naythur. It's port, an

And he opened the bottle with dignity.
They had but once sipped the unwonted liquor, and
were beginning to comment upon its taste, when once
again there came a rap tipon the door, a rap as peremp
tory and official ns the first. Fin Strait, fearful of intrus
ively thirsty throats, hid the second bottle promptly, and
Mother Revell drew nearer the stove, away from the
draft of the opening door. Again the snow drifted in as
Martin Revell ' answered the knock, and again a snow
bespattered orderly entered. This time it was the orderly
â  trumpeter from the sergeant maior's office.
"Sorry to disturb you, Mrs. Revell," he said. "Order
from the adjutant's office, sergeant."
"Hello!" shouted, the sergeant, reading the order.
"Paymaster coming up from Fort Nickerson. Healy."
"It's time." growled the corporal. "It's stony .1 am."
'Mother, I'm In charge of the escort to meet him at

"Aw!" the farrier cried. "The sergeant major don't

"I'll report at the office with my men and the escort
I GOT into politics naturally enough and yet accident
allyâat least not purposely. I went into the army
in 1862 when but 16 years of age, and before I had
completed my education. I served three years until
the close of the war, and then at 19 came home from
the excitements of the field and resumed my studies.
It was a time of great political events. There was in
tense feeling. Great men were on the stage and great
questions were engaging attention. We were working
out the settlements of the war. I naturally took inter
est in all that was occurring and thus became familiar
with politics before quitting- the academic life.
I left school notwithstanding, without any thought
of engaging in public affairs. On the contrary, I had
a fixed determination to adhere strictly and exclusively
to the practice of the law. I got along very well in that
, profession until General Grant's second campaign in
1872. I was his great admirer, and could not resist the
â¢ temptation to take the stump and make answer as best I
could to the fierce charges of various kinds that were
- made against him. This was the putting of the hand to
'.he plow, and there was no turning back.
The demands for campaign work grew with the
years, and before I knew it I was being mentioned
favorably in connection with official position, and fin
ally in April, 1579, I had my first personal political suc
cess in the shape of an election to the office of Judge of
the Superior Court of Cincinnati.
After three years of agreeable official life I became
HI, and on that account resigned. 1 quickly regained
my health, however, and once more engaged in the
practice of law. I had no thought of returning to pub
lic life. I was therefore surprised as well as gratified
when the following year. 1883, I was nominated for Gov
ernor without opposition and by acclamation. Since
then I have had a very active and at times rather
tempestuous experience.

"It's a bitter cold night for escort duty," said Mother
Revell. anxiously. "Wear all your furs, Martin, and take

I'll fill a flask of the maior's port."
'"She knows it all." Fin Strait murmured admiringly,
toasting his toes at the stove. "She's an old \varhors> . is

Mother Revell let her tall boy out. kissing him good

for that slip about his father. 1 forgot."
"Hush:" said Mother Revell. paling. "There's only
you and Healy and the major left that knows the truth
of it. The boy need never know. Come-, you've all given
toasts but me. Here's mine. The new sergeant! May he
never know trouble."
There was a tear in her eye as she .sipped the wine.
The harness of the six-mule team shook merrily in the
moonlight, but the wheels of the escort wagon were al
most soundless in the deep snow. The wind tossed up
great drifts, through which the mules plunged with snort
ing breathâ breath that passed out on the rreezing air in
white clouds. Round and round, all about, west where
the foothills cuddled close to the mountains, norm, east
and south, there was nothing to be seen but tne soft,
white moonlight, falling upon the bolder white of the flat
and snowy plains. The escort, not yet appeased at their
fortune in being turned out for such duty on so cold a
night, growled within the canvas covering of the wagon
or tried to sleep. The night passed thus monotonously,
and it was nearly dawn when the junior sergeant awoko
and was softly called by the teamster In front. They
were fording an icy stream at a bend, where the creek
split and broke about a wooded island, a bushy strip of
land some twenty yards broad. The gray-bearded citizen
driver jerked his fur hat toward the isle.
"D'ye mind, Martin, when you was a kid at the post
school, and the paymaster's clerk was brought in dead
find the money gone? 'Twas there they done it â Wild
Horse Bend."
"I remember something of it," Martin annwered. "ten
or twelve years back. One of them was shot. There's
never been any trouble up here since, has there?"
"Nope," said the teamster, yawning.
All day they made camp and rested their mules at
Wolf Creek; lighted a roaring fire and ate steaks from
an antelope a lucky shot had gathered in. A^noon there
dashed up, with a clatter of harness and a cloud of crisp
snow, the paymaster's ambulance, and, behind it, the
escort from Fort Nickerson. The impatient officer, anx
ious to get on, announced his intention of resting just
long enough to feed and refresh his team and then riding
through the night, and paying off next day.
Once more the escort climbed into their wagon, shortly
before sunset, but now they had to dispense with the can
vas shelter and keep broadly awake, following closely the
paymaster's lighter ambulance, precious with the treas
ure of two months' pay for 400 men. The moonlight was
gone; gray clouds had sullenly been driven up by the
scourging wind. The sno%v drifted so thickly that the
air looked as in a snowstorm. By 10 at night, when they
came to AVild Horse Bend, the teamsters were pressing
forward their teams and thinking of bllksards. The es
cort was fifty yards behind, when the ambulance rmiles
slowed down and began to ford the stream at the island.
The soldiers' sore eyes were weary, facing the wind and
piercing darkness, and the teamster was too cold to swear
much as he urged his wagon after the lighter vehicle!
They were hut a few yards behind, when from the bushes
of the isle sounded the quick crack of a rifle and the am
bulance driver gave first a cry of pain arid then a tempest
of curses. The echo of the first shot still sang in the
wood, when "blng. bing!" replied the revolvers of the
ready paymaster and his clerk. Somebody shouted a
command, and four dark forms leaped from the brush.
"Hands up! Grab that bag, Jack, on the front seat!
Hands up. dâ n you! Quick!"
"Drop that bag!" cried the paymaster. "Sergeant!"
And then came a dreadful scream as a pistol cracked
at his eye and he fell back dead.
The soldiers were out of the wagon, plunging through
the drifts, and even as the paymaster fell Sergeant Revell
discharged his carbine and dashed to the rescue, followed
by the men. At the ambulance the clerk was fighting
furiously; the precious bag he had thrown between his
feet. Then the soldiers were upon them and it wis all
over. The robbers had not been quick enough in their
daring dash. The man at the heads of tho plunging mules
slipped off first, and the other three dashed across the
half-frozen water a,t the sight of the blue and belted over
coats. The squad fired a volley after then:, futile in the
storm and darkness, but Sergeant Revell tniddenly darted
from the others, plunging kneedeep into the creek. One
of the outlaws had slipped and Btumblpd in the stream.

the two men rolled over the pebbly bottom. Martin held
fast, and quickly others came to his assistance with
ropes. In a few minutes the prisoner, bound cruelly tight,
lay at the bottom of the wagon, a mat for the soldiers'
feet, and the teams were away at a swift trot for the
post, the pay chest safe, but the paymaster murdered.
Mother Revell, r>]rl campaigner and fearless of weath
ers, pulled on a warmly lined pair of rubber boots that
showed honestly beneath her sensibly short skirts, wrap
HOW TO SUCCEED IN POLITICS
In my first campaign for Governor the liquor ques
tion was uppermost in the minds of the people, and I
was defeated, but two years later, in 1885, I was re
nominated and elected. 1 was re-elected in 18S7 and
renominated in 1889 for the fourth time and for a third
term and again defeated.
I was a candidate for United States Senator in 1892,
"but was defeated by Senator Sherman, who received
fifty-three votes to my thirty-eight. In 1896 I was
elected to the Senate without Republican opposition.
I attended the National Republican Conventions of
1884, 1888, 1892 and 1896, each time as a delegate at large
and each time chosen by acclamation. In 1884 and
again in 1888 I was chairman of the Ohio delegation,
and both times presented the name of Senator Sher
man as Ohio's candidate for the Presidency.
In 1892 and again in 1896 I was chairman of the com
mittee on resolutions, and as such each time reported
the national Republican platform to the convention. 1
also, in 1896, placed President McKinley's name in nomi
nation. In all these years I have taken an active part
on the stump, not only in Ohio, but also in other States.
I mention all this because i am asked to do so and
because it will indicate that I have not only had con
siderable experience, but that it has been of a varied
character. While I have had some successes, I

tured boldly away from her little cottage by the creek,
plodding through the knee-deep snow. The blizzard which
the teamster had scented afar had blown past, and again
the wind was stilled, so that the drifts lay motionless,
freezing crisply in the moonless night. Number One on
the guardhouse porch, beyond the lines of barracks and
officers' houses, lonely in its grimness, saw her coming, a
cloth-covered basket on her arm, and challenged her with
smiling- ceremony.
"Who comes there?" he cried, and she answered
cheerily, "A friend."
"You bet you are, Mother Revell." said the sentry,
and helped her onto the porch. "Want to see the ser
geant?"
He opened the guardroom door and pushed her gently
in.
"Another prisoner for you, sergeant," he said, and
grinned.
"Holloa, mother!" cried the sergeant of the guard,
coming forward from his little office bedroom. "What
brings you out in the snow?"
"It's Mother Revell!" the troopers called out, throw
ing aside cards and jumping from their bunks, "and a
basket. What's in the basket?"
"I thought." said the little gentle-eyed woman, who,
for all her long, rough life with the army, could yet blush
pleasantly. "I thought as it was Martin's first guard fis a
sergeant, you boys wouldn't mind if I just fixed you all
a lunch, seeing its so cold."
The sergeant laughed and gave the little woman a
boy's hard squeeze.
"You ought to tie brevetted colonel!" screeched the
young trumnrtr'r.
"Ach! Mvitter Revell! Why vas you not secretary of
var made alretty?" a Dutchman grunted.
Number One poked his head in at the door anxiously.
"Make them keep some tor me, Mrs. Revell." he crierl,
earnestly. "I've half ah hour yet to freeze out here."
Hot mince pies and a can of better than messroom
coffee came from the big basket, and the'soldiers ate with
boisterous good humor. Mrs. Revell sat on the rdge of a
trunk and eyed them comfortably. She knew them all.
knew many of their secrets, as she had known recruit and
veteran, private and sergeant of the old troop for twenty
years and more. Her quick gray eyes glanced from orw
to the other motherly.
"Brown," she said, "is them your best boots? Mind
you draw a new pair next clothing issue. You'll be on
the sick report with pneumonia if you don't take care.
Billy McNab, how's your arm? T\ought you knew better
than let your horse throw you. Have you got enough
coffee? Martin, boy?"
"How. mother?"
Mrs. Revell glanced at the barred and closed door of
the common prison roojn.
"Mayn't they have some, poor things?"
"Oh, we're empty to-night, mother. There's only old
Barney Constableâ the usual thingâ and he's sleeping it
off."
"Poor old Barney! T doubt but they'll bobtail him in
the end. Where's theâ the stage robber?" she whispered.
"Sulking in his cell there. I guess they'll ship him oft!
to the civil authorities soon if the rpads open up. If it
hadn't been for the blizzard they'd have sent him before
this. We've had him five days now. and the adjutant
don't like the responsibility <>t" keeping such a desperate
murderer in this old wooden shack."
Mother Revoll had a little of a woman's curiosity and
a great deal of a woman's tenderness.
"He must be cold in that dark cell," she murmured.
"Won't you give him a mug of hot coffee?"
"He'd only growl and refuse it."
"Let me," said Mother Revell, with innate Red Cross
proclivities.
She took the tin cup and filled it steaming full, and
took as well a piece of pie. With these- she stepped
lightly along the dark corridor to the rurthest cell, a
dark and chilly dungeon, utterly lonesome, securely
barre/1. She paused timidly a foot away from the grating.
By the smoky light of the oil lamp in the corridor she
made out to see a bundle of blankets In the far corner.
"Would yon like a cup of coffee and a piece of hot
pie?" asked Mother Revell.
The blanket was slipped from a shaggy, gray-haired,
gray-bearded head, and two eves, redshot, stared out.
"I've brought you a cupâ"
The, blankets were tossed aside, and the prisoner made
a spring at the bars. His lips were apart in surprise; his
hands shook: his eyos were eager.
"Good Lord! Are you still with the boys?" he whis
pered. /â  .
The mug of coffee shook in Mother Revell's hand until
much of the draft was spilled on the worn-out boards
but Mother Revell had courage and wit ana presence of
mind, developed by her unusual training. She neither
screamed nor fainted, but her breath came pantingly
"You again!" she whispered at last, and they were,
silent, staring at each other, the man with an astonished'
half-pleased smile, the woman white and dazed. At last
she found herself and pushed the coffee and pie between
the ba.rs.
''Drink it!" she murmured. "I shall see you again "
He nodded to her and gulped the hot drink down 'and
took the pie.
Mother Revell had been gone but two minutes when
she came back to the guardroom.
Did that brute frighten you?" cried Martin. "You
are white as your apron "
"Hush, Martin," said the old lady with a shiver.

He patted his mother's cheek, and she tried to laugh,
then took her basket and bade them all goodnight and a
quiet guard. She walked steadily home, tramping brave

greetings of a 1 party of officers she met as they came out
of the club. but. once home, she locked and barred -the
door, put out the light, .and sat. her face hidden in her

Before the bugles sounded reveille round the white
counterpaned parade ground she was up and ousy, poking
into odd corners for something she ffowningly sought. At
last she found it. a little steel tool, and she slipped it in
the bosom of her dress. She fed the stove and made cof
foe again and filled her can. , Then, while the dawn hung
timorously in doubt, and the sky. in the east was slowly
trembling from violet to gray, she pulled on. her boots and
took her shawl . and once , more started for the guard
house. There the men were weary, and â  those not out on
post were sleeping. The young sergeant was wrapped in
his blankets, sound and snoring, and a drowsy corporal
was in charge. He brightened at sight of Mother Revell's
can. â  . â 
"Begum, but you'll spile the sergeant with yer cod

Mother Revell shook her head, and poured out a mug

"Is he asleep?" she asked, nodding toward the pris

"Nop. Just now he was swearin' at the cold." -I. â ;--:i
"It is horribly cold in there," she said. "Won't you

"Shucks,. Mrs. Revell, ye're all heart. 'Twas him

The corporal shrugged his shoulders. It was nard to
refuse Mother Revell anything. So. again she slipped
along the corridor. : The -prisoner must have heard her
voice, for he was already at the bars.
â  "Bessie," he hoarsely whispered. "You're the same as
ever â a good old girl. And you haven't forgotten the old
man. A corner of your heart for him still, eh?" â¢ . â :.. /
She shrunk from his bloated face for a moment, the
next she stepped determinedly to the grating.
"Listen,'.' she murmured hurriedly. "Don't touch my
hand. I'm going to help you. but not for your sakeâ for
the same reason I helped you before, when. In your drink
ing craze, you shot the cowboy in Dodge. I wanted to
save my boy the shame of hearing his father was hanged.
I want to save him again." â¢
"Little Martinâ the baby! Bessie, is he here? Let me
see himâ Bess!" 'â â .:;: . .
."Never." she cried . fiercely. "He's doing well, he's a
boy to be proud of. , He studies and will pass for a com
mission in time. He knows nothing of your life, of you,
and never shall. I'd die first. Do you think I'd see the
boy creep about In shame for his father, a deserter, twice
a murderer? Could he hold up his head among his com
rades when he's an officer and a gentleman, as he will be,
as he deserves to be? See you! Never! You must go
awayâ escape, else there are some here -will recognize
you."
She was trembling now, and he gulped the steaming
coffee sulkily. The men snored; the corporal nodded over
his stove. . .
"What name have you gone by? You dare not call
yourself Revell?"
"Hardly."" he grinned.
"Take this.", she said.. and gave him the tool from her
dress, vit's all T could findâ gimlet. You bore hole af

It's slow and you must be cautious of the guard seeing,

half between floor and ground. You can crawl out.' It
was done once by a man at Fort McKinney. Look out for
Number One. He nasses around the guardhouse every
quarter of an hour." .
He took the tool eagerly and she turned away.
- "Bessie!'-'- .
Phe paused.
"I saw in a paper that Pollock was made a major. He
always had luck. You and T remember him as a big buck
private when I was a sergeant in the war. Say. Is heâ is

She slipped quickly from him and through the guard

The young sergeant came to his mother's little break
fast table in poor humor.
"Mother, can you give me something to eat?" he cried.
"They've detailed a new cook, and he can't either bake
beans or make coffee. The mess breakfast was ruined.
This is something like. Nobody, alive or dead, ever made
hash like you. mother, and this is coffee, not bootleg. Say,
mother, you're pale. What have you been doing to your

her cheek. "I'm all right, Martin. Are you off duty to
day?"
He shook his head.
"No such luck. Guard," he answered, and bent hun
grily over his plate.
Mother Revell paled again and trembled.
"Guard!" she said at last. "Why, Martin, you were
on the night before last."
"Can't help it. Seheidermann's gone slclc: Foley s act

much better acquainted with him, and look upon him

Recurring now to your Questions, it is upon this kind
of experience that I would advise a young man to con
sider well before he enters politics. Unless he has apti
tude for public affairs he is not likely to succeed, and if
he has power to succeed he must expect all kinds of upa
and downs. To-day successful and popular: to-morrow,
defeated and censured; sometimes justly, but more fre
quently unjustly.
To withstand all this he must have good nature and
the qualities of self-adaptation. He must learn that his
own i- :rsonality is not important to anybody but him
self, id consequently the people do not care anything
about his grievances. He must keep them to himself.
When he meers with disappointment he must accept
it as all right and bÂ« satisfied to abide by it no matter
how permanent its consequences may be. Tf time
should enable him to recover, as it probably will, it will
not only be clear gain, but he will be stronger than
ever, while if he does not recover he is no worse off be
cause of keeping his temper.
I do not think any programme cp.n 'oe outlined for
a young man excepting in the most general way.

"That hangdog roadagent is to be sent to the railway
to-morrow. The sheriff will take charge of him there.
Mother Revell huddled up in. her chair as tne door
closed behind her and became a nervous bundle of anx
ious fears.
"To-night." she muttered. "He must escape to-night.
And Martin on guard! If he should fail, if the guard
shoots himâ a son shoot his father down! O! O! And v
he succeeds, Martin will be tried for allowing the escape,
for neglect of duty and be reduced! It will ruin his
chance of promotion. O! O!" .
She sat stunned until the bugles on the parade grouna
announced guard mount. She stole to the window, ana
watched. Crash went the band; all the familiar, stirring
maneuvers were performed in the bright winter sun. The
band ceased; the adjutant and sergeant major salutea;
the shrill bugles advanced, and the new guard marchea
off to the guardroom, the tall and bright-eyed young ser
geant in command. She could hear his clear voice even
when he was out of sight at the distant guardhouseâ
"New guard! Present arms!"
Evening stable call and the troopers in white stable
dress, trotting at double time through tne rrosty air of
the falling dayâ supper callâ retreat and the sunset gun.
Martin ran in to see her and found her so white ne re
solved to bring the post surgeon in the morning. DarK
ness, but she lighted no lamp, and at last came tattoo ana
taps to usher in a windy night, with white clouds swiftly
crossing the half moon. Nightâ the final click of the bil
liard balls in the club, the linal Â«ong at Captain West s
evening party, the first silent round of the officer of the
day. The sentry at the guardhouse lifted up his voice:
"Number One, 12 o'clock:" and from the corral, from the
cavalry stables, from the haystacks and from the distant
sawmill came the swift replies of lonely sentinelsâ "l 2
o'clock and all's well!"
Mothar Revell rose up. unable to wait longer to bear
the suspense. She stole from the house. Well she knew
the old post and how to hide in the shadows and how to
avoid the sentries. Unseen, filled with a shuddering dis
gust with herself at having so to hide, she gained the
rear of the guardhouse. There, there stood a little clump
of scrub oaks by a spring of clear water, and in their
shadows the little woman crouched and watched.
Tramp, tramp, tramp, to the end of the porch; Â«to the
rear, march! and tramp, tramp, tramp to the other end;
shift carbine to the other shoulder, and it's time to pa
trol round the guardhouse. So went Numoer One, monot
onously, distractingly. Once, twice, thrice and four times
he passed round the 'building, and it was 1 o'clock. Again
he sang the hour, and again came back the distant echo
ing sentries' calls, "All's we;i!"
Mother Revell was in a fever; she felt no cold; her
eyes sought continuously the yawning blackness between
the walls of the old guardhouse and the snowy ground.
Again the faithful sentry passed around and went back
to the porch. A minuto passed, and something protruded
from beneath the guardhouse, reaching out to the white
snow, stealthily, on its belly, like a great, sneaking cat.
Mother Revell clasped her hands and shook and watched.
Inch by inch he cameâ the murderer, a big man, while the
hole was narrow. The moon glanced upon him and sho
saw the glitter of his excited, determined eyes. Inch by
inch, without a sound, he dragged himself to freedom,
and Number One continued to tramp the wooden porch
unsuspectingly. The man was out and on his feet, stoop
ing low. glancing here and there to make sure of the light
direction to run. . , ...
"Quick, quick! Oh. man, be off with you, quick!
murmured Mother Revell.
As if he heard her he started to run through the deep
snow soundlessly. One step he took, and Mother Revell
closed her eyes "in despair. The man's legs, cramped by
confinement, were uncertain. His toe struck a rock in
the snow, and he fell, noisily bumping against the wooden
wall. At that he forget himself, or became at once reck
less, and swore aloud.
"Sergeant of the guard!" the sentry shouted, ana
dashed round the house, while inside tumult and clashing
steel resounded. The prisoner picked himself up, nut
slipped and slid again before he could start afresh, so that
Number One. carbine loaded and cocked, was on his
heels. It was no intention of the sentry's to kill, but
rather to recapture alive. He brought the butt to the
front swiftly and thrust viciously to knock his man over
like a rabbit. The running blow missed, and in an instant
the prisoner turned, a shaggy, wild-eyed ima^e of desper
ation. They closed, but for a sec"ohd. The next instant
the sentry lay on the snow and the prisoner had the car
bine. He was off again with a clash, but now the guard
came running out, Sergeant Revell ten paces in advance,
revolver at the ready.
"Halt, or I fire!"
"The prisoner swung about and brought the carbin*
to his shoulder. A scream came from the spring, and
mother Revell ran out. wring-ing her hands.
"No! no! Both of you. Don't shoot!"
She rushed to her son and flung herself emreatingly
on his breast, but not before his revolver had cracked.
The prisoner was a second later. I'nhurt by Martin's
bullet, he returned the fire as Mother Revell clasped her
boy. Martin heard his mother cry out. in pain, and fplt
her fall heavily forward upon his rescuing arm. The
guard rushed past, carbines ready, in pursuit of the fugi
tive, but the sergeant of thp guard paid no attention to
them. He picked the little unconscious woman up in his
arms and dashed away to the post hospital, terror in his
eyes.

"How is she?"
"Is she better?"
"Ts there any chance for her?"
All day long the men came slipping up to the hospital
and whispered their anxious inquiries in the attendants*
ears, and went off in gloom when the steward pursed his
lips and shook his head.
Toward evening she became sensible, and found Mar
tin in the room with the doctor, and a tall mustached fig
ure in the shadows of a corner.
"Martin." she whispered, "are you hurt, boy?"
"T wish I wore, dear little mother." he cried, "so that
you were safe."
"Hush! None of that now. sergeant, or you'll have to
get out." the doctor said, as the lad flung himself on his
knees by the bed
Mother Revell petted her-boy'shand weakly, and her
eyes sought the corner.
"Is it you. major?" she asked, softly, and the officer
commanding came silently to her side.
"Mother Revell." he whispered, "don't you wish to
speak to me?"
She paused, closing her eyes, and then opened them
upon the doctor.
"Tve seen many of the poor boys go, doctor, she
said. "Tel! me.'"
And he told her. The doctor took Martin by the shoul
der and pushed him out before him gently. ;md the maior
and Mother Revell were left alone. At once she asked:
"He was caught?"
"He was shot down. dead. Bessie."
"And you recognized him?"
"But nobody else. Bessie. Nobody shaTl know he was
Sergeant Revell."
''Thank you. major." sho sighed, with a content that
almost stifled her pain. "Martin will never know whenâ
when hps an officer and a erentleman. Major, you've been
very, v^ry good and kind."
"I'd have done more if you'd let me. Bessie," he an
swered.
"Do it for Martin," she pleaded. "He's not like hi 3
father."
. "No. no, Bess â like you. dear girl, like you. Bess."
She looked at him with a faint shake of the head.
"Bess, give me a right to be a father to the boy.
Thrice I've asked you. and you refused, though Revell
was eood as dead."
"For your sakp. major. I'm only a laundress."
"I rose from the ranks." he replied. "I don't want to
think that the rascal who spoiled your Jire won 'to the.
end. I've been patient. Let me remember you as my
wifeâ take my name."
Afrain she motioned "No."
"I've monpy. Bess, and Martin will bp my son â I hayÂ«
influence, and Martin, as my son. w,jll draw on it natur
ally."
"You attack the weaker wing, major," she answered,
and pressed his hand.
"Yes?"
"Yes."
He stooped and kissed her and hurried out to send his
orderly for the post chaplain. Martin, r>ew!!dered. wag
there, and the doctor, and these alr.ne saw Mother Rpvpll
acknowledge the mistake of her hasty girlhood, and mar
ry at last the man who had patipntly waited.
After that she lay in pain, sinking swiftly, and grpw a
little delirious, and saw into the future, uppaking of her
hoy as "Captain Revell. a gallant officer and Â«*entlpman."
At 9 o'clock she was very weak, but sensible, and sent
messages to a number of her childrenâ the jrHpf-strickpn
trooners. Shortly, she whispered to them to open tho
window, although it was very cold, and they did so.
"I want to hear the bugles." she said.
Soon they soundedâ the last, last friendly, loving call

regard as absolutely essential to genuine
success in any of the important # walks or rela

hard worker.
No matter what bis intellectual endowments

REV. D. W. LE LACHEUR has just returned from a mis
sionary trip into the wilds of Thibet. He was given special
passports by the native authorities, but duty took him
through sections of the country, like the robbsr districts,
where all authority was defied. He was the first one to pass
through the great gate between China and Thibet, and which was
flung open to qualified travelers holding the ofiicial permission for
the first time last August. Dr. Le Lacheur's life was threatened
numerous times by privations and murderous bands of natives,
but he succeeded at last in reaching the land of the Grand
Buddha, where he was received as the Grand Lama of all the
Americas. '
Dr. Le Lacheur established vis mission and then returned to this
country. It was while Dr. Le Lacheur was experiencing his hair
breadth escapes and thrilling adventures in one part cf the coun
try that Henry Savage Landor was undergoing tortures in an
other part of the country for daring to venture there.

fore the country was reached, Dr.
Lacheur said:
â¢Our route lying through Northern
China, we re-embarked fur Shanghai
traveling by boat 300 miles up the
"iang-tse-Kiang River. Three and a
half days were consumed in making
Luhu, our next station, and the jour
ney onward to Peking was made in
carts, a mode of travel before which
the dangers and discomforts of a sea
voyage sink into utter insignificance.
"The wheels of a Chinese cart do not
revolve upon the axle, but the axle
itself revolves. There is a springless
box above it in which your bed, an
essential part of a traveler's outfit, is
placed, your baggage is compactly
stored, and you seat yourself up.-n
your bed in the bottom of the cart.
The driver takes his position forward
upon the shafts behind his lean ani
mal.
"The roads axe never mended and
hence are full of the deepest ruts.
Throughout an entire Journey the trav
eler is compelled to keep a firm grip
with both hands upon each side of the
cart. A lapse even into momentary
forgetfulness is apt to result in his
being flung about like a pea In a hot
pan. I learned this to my cost, for I
entered Peking with one of the black
est eyes I have had since I was a boy.
"At Peking, composed ot three or
dinary- cities, and the dirtiest city in all
dirty China, we abandoned the carts
and employed mules as a means of
transportation.
"With a master who lives upon 2'Â«
cents per day for food, the Chinese
mule seldom displays superabundant
energy and spirit from overfeeding, but
he has life enough to carry a rider. A
folded cloth is put over his sharp bark
bone, a saddle, or frame made of four
pieces of wood, is placed over the

"In this manner we journeyed to
Kalgau, a city which stands under the
shadow of the great' wall. Since its
building kingdoms and nations have
risen and decayed.
"At Kalgau we took the carts again,
journeying fourteen days beyond the
great wall t<.- Pao Ta<>, and found that
the Ordes Desert lay before us. For
six months of the year no caravan will
venture to cross this desolate waste.
"To our guides we urged the neces
sity of making the journey, but no one
would risk either horses or camels
upon the burning sands.
"So we gathered together the horses
and mules of the nearby missions, and
supplying ourselves with food and
wate*, and adding to our number a
muleteer and Thibetan priest, westart
ed across the desert. Heat and dust
at once combined to blind and suffocate
us. But we plodded on day after day,
our heads throbbing and the blood in
our veins seemingly turned to fire.
"Our muleteer became so blind that
lie could not distinguish one animal
from another; our food dried until it
was scarce eatable. At the last we rode.
from sun to sun without a drop of
water to cool our swollen tongues.
"The biscuit, which was the only
food carried for our animals, had to be
broken into bits with stones; it had
become too hard for them to bite. The
plight of one poor brute became so piti
able from lack of water that it was
mercifully killed.
"Added to this misery our way was
beset with packs of fierce wild dogs.
In <-ne locality the boy on guard fought
then throughout the entire night, as
they jumped into the inclosure where
our animals were confined.
"But after fourteen terrible days we
arrived at Ping Lo, and in due time
went on to Tou Jou, where Mr. Christy,
who acted as my interpreter, had for
three years been waiting and prepar
ing to enter Thibet.
"Official permission to proceed into
Thibet was at last given, upon the
morning of the 2d of last August. Early
one day, while it was yet dark, I, with
my two companions, waited before the
great locked gate in the crumbling old
wall which divides Thibet from China,
for the gray of dawn and the firing of
a gun, the signal for the opening of
the gate.
â¢'At last the gun sounded and the
guards stationed at the gate to collect
money from all who entered motioned
us to pass through as the gate swung
back. Strange to say they demanded
no tithes, as we entered Thibet.

MALTED IN THE ROBBER DISTRICT.
avnn that had just passed through the
robber district. This district extends
seventy miles upon the opposite side
of the mountain range to be crossed in
reaching La Brang.
"We were warned not to attempt to
pass through this robber district. The
caravan leader told me that the rob
bers had cut off the right arm of one
of his party: another man had been
killed outright and he himself had been
robbed of 600 taels.
"After listening to his terrible ad
ventures In the district both our mule
teer and priest flatly refused to accom
pany us farther by that route. We
were advised to either change our
course or engage a party of soldiers.
"To engage soldiers appeared to me
too inconsistent with our frank declar
ation that we had come among this
people to teach 'Peace on earth and
good will toward men,' and also to
teach our belief in a higher power than
man's. We therefore -decided to con
tinue our journey through the robber
district and not to hiro any soldiers.
"The second day, as we journeyed
among the mountains. 12.000 feet above
sea level, a turn of the path brought
us without warning into an encamp
ment of robbers. The chief was in
their center and over his head attend
ants were holding a huge umbrella.
"There were fuliy forty of them. With
the exception of their chief they were
all brawny young fellows, naked to
the loins and fully armed, having a
great Thibetan gun strapped to their
back, a broadsword slung across their
breast, and in their hands huge spears
with gleaming heads eighteen inches
long. Each spear measured twenty
feet. They throw them with the ac
curacy a gunner sends a cannon ball.
"As the robbers caught sight of our
party they formed a complete and com
pact circle about the sacred person of
their chief, and gave vent to a yell that
might have come from the throats of
fiends instead of men. This is their cus
tom to frighten travelers. When the af
frightencd turn terror-stricken to flee
the robbers pursue and kill them.
"Though the sight of them in war
gear and the yell which greeted us was
appalling, I said to George Shields, the
grand young Srotch minister, who rode
by my side: 'It's no time to be afraid
now. Remember, we are in the hands
of One who so far has protected us.'
"And checking our trembling horses

band, defenseless save for the Invisible
Arm.

seemed to paralyze the robbers. Very

All these exercises must be constantly

"After brief pause we resumed our
journey, pacing slowly down the path.
"The Thibetan robbers stood as
though stricken helpless, their hands
upon their spears, gazing after us. But
they made no further attempt to mo
lest us.
"This was the only time we encoun
tered them; but as we traveled along
we saw outposts on the mountain and
heard them calling to each other, and
also heard their magnificent horses gal
loping in our direction. Their horses
are the finest in all Thibet. We reached
La Brangr, the temple center, in safety
and put up at a native inn.
"In a native inn of Thibet men,
horses, mules, all herd together in
one rloorless apartment, separated by
an apology for a partition from the
other apartment reserved for the inn
keeper, his family and his animals.
"We had, however, reached the land
of our hopes after passing 100 days in
the saddle. We had slept for three
and a half months upon the ground,
and had been seven months in making
the journey from the Chinese coast.
"We could rent rto houses to live in,
but I succeeded, through persistence,
in renting part of the inn and we re
arranged things more on our own
plans.
"To our intense surprise, word came
that the great, living Buddha from the
temple of Stag-dge would call upon
me.
"He came attired in his rich robes
with a company of attendant priests,
a young man of prepossessing appear
ance, who welcomed us most kindly
through Mr. Christy. Notwithstand
ing my denial of the appellation, he per
sisted in styling me the Great Sacred
Lama of America.
"The Buddha followed up his call by
a formal invitation to visit him at his
residence temple some miles from L,a
Brang.
We would gladly have rested in
stead, but the courtesy was not to be
slighted, so on the Wednesday follow
ing our arrival we made the visit and
found our host waiting to receive us
at the top of his temple stairs. An
honor which he had never paid to the
highest dignitary of his own country.
"When the hour for worship came
we were invited to join him in the
temple. He occupies a high, throne
like seat, about which kneel, upon a
platform a step lower, the first lamas.
The second lamns .ire a step lower
still and the common prtests kneel upon
the floor. The services consisted prin
cipally of worshiping the Buddha.
"As we entered the temple he bade
me seat myself upon the throne, and
when I refused he gently pulled me
down and seated himself at my side.

ability to do these things he must still
practice the exercises until a rapid move

laid down for the position of the hands
and fingers In order to get certain results.

"Following this worship came a feast,
of which the first course was boiled
meat cut into small squares.
"Boiled greens were next served and
then the dish of Thibetâ the wooden
bowl â was handed to each guest, and
each bowl contained a piece of butter.
"In Thibet fresh butter is at a dis
count, and that from two to three
years old at a premium, and as the
Buddha is served with the best in the
land the butter in America would not
have been termed gilt-edged.
"An attendant poured hot tea into
the bowls and we were invited to drink
the beverage, which we did, blowing
the floating butter aside; and I had
cause to be thankful that I wore a
mustache, as it acted as a sort of bar
rier against that dreadful butter.
"Before the tea was all consumed a
skin of brown barley meal, made from
grain which is parched before grind
ing, was passed around.
"Into this skin, the dried stomach of
an animal, each man dipped his hand
and stirring the handful of meal into
the remaining tea ate the mixture with
the finger which did the stirring. Each
guest then cleaned his own bowl by
the simple and entirely satisfactory
process resorted to by one's pet re
triever and the feast was concluded.
"The Buddha's kindness to me
throughout my stay in Thibet was un
varying. At my departure he presented
me with the passport, the only one, so
far as known, issued to a foreigner.
"The sentence, 'This passport con
tains a drop of gold,' is from their
greatest proverb and signifies the most
sacred friendship.
"The choice of a Buddha's successor
If based upon the theory of reincarna
tion.
"At his death the lamas carefully
note the exact hour and minute, and
search is made for a male child whose
birth corresponds to the date of the
Buddha's death. When the child is
found it is at once borne away to the
temple, where it is reared as the living
Buddha, whose soul is supposed to have
entered its body.
"In the temple district or center there
are 3600 resident priests with even a
greater number traveling about the
counties performing their various of
fices.
"In Thibet there is a system of edu
cation for the priests, but none for the
people, and though occasionally a man
outside the priesthood may be found
who can read or write, there is not one
woman in thousands who can do so.
"They are a generous people, and the
trend of their nature is religious. In
habits and appearance they resemble
our North American Indian more than
any people among the numerous races
I have met.

"The prevailing native garment, for
both men and women, is a long robe
made of lamb skin with the wool worn
inside. This is their only garment. It
is held in place by a leather girdle.
"On the Chinese side of Thibet among
the cave villages are a number of tribes
whose cmly distinguishing mark is the
headdress of their women.
"One of these head arrangements
consists of a. strip of leather ten inches
long by four inches wide, placed across
the back of the head. There are num
erous holes in the leather through
which the hair is drawn in tiny braids;
these braids are lengthened by thick
cords till they reach the ground, and to
each tress a smaller piece of leather
is fastened.
"The foot wear of the Thibetan is
very like the Indian mocassin, and the
men wear foxskin caps the year round.
'"The houses are superior to the Chi
nese house.
"As in China, their marriages are ar
ranged by a go-between, and upon the
day of the final ceremony the bride,
with several priests and a band of
maidens, approaches the home of the
bridegroom.
"When very near the bride, supported
by two maidens, walks falteringly with
bowed head to one end of the long mat
placed before his door, which then
opens, the groom walks out and takes
his stand opposite her, from where he
casts a rope about her and thus draw
ing her to him proceeds to cut the rope
with a huge knife.
"The marriage ceremony is then vir

cake of browned flour, borne upon a
triangle of wood, and into which the
priests have for days been praying all
the evils incident to married life. Is
brought out and thrown down to be
broken in pieces and eaten by the dogs.
"Then, amid the beating of drums and
the music of numerous instruments,
the couple, with their friends, enter the
house and the marriage is concluded
by a feast.
"Regarding our work in Thibet, the
young man left in charge of the mis
sion established has succeeded in win
ning the good will and confidence of
the people. He has extended his labors
sixty miles inland from La Brang to
ward that mysterious center, and is
now in the great military center. He
has been promised protection by a high
official, providing he does not enter the
robber district.

the respect and confidence of the na
tives and proving to them that he has

LAST SAD RELIC OF PAMELA
And the Irish Revolution.
THERE was recently sold to the highest bidder at Sotheby's auction mart In
London a little miniature of a beautiful woman that recalls one of the. saddest
and most romantic Incidents of the Irish rebellion of 1798. The miniature was
' that of Lady Edward Fitzgerald, the beautiful Pamela, wife of the hero pa
triot who figured so prominently in that revolutionary conspiracy. The relic
was. bestowed upon one, the, Rev. Mr. Murphy, as a token of appreciation of kind ser
vices rendered the fair lady in a dire extremity, and when all friends had forsaken
her. It has remained a treasured memento In his family until recently, when cir
cumstances compelled a lineal descendant to dispose of It under the hammer. It
brought Â£75, or $375, and was knocked down to an unknown bidder
The miniature, which- is painted on ivory and bound with gold contains at the
bacK a lock of the fair Pamela's hair, which adds to its already great historical In
terest. â â ... : . -"â .'â â  â â -'-â¢ â  â  â -â _â .. â  -..--â¢:.-;-,
The story of Lady Edward Fitzgerald Is one of the most romantic that history
affords. She was a native of France, but about her birth there hangs considerable
cbscurity. One account claims that she was the daughter of Madame de Genlls and
the Due d'Orleans, which would make her a half-sister of Louis Philippe; but other
authorities say that Madame de Genlls had merely adopted the child on account of
her beauty, as she had adopted others, and that the mystery of Pamela's birth was
never unraveled. â  ;
Be that as it may, the fact remains that at the age of 17 Pamela was one of the
most beautiful maidens In ; Paris, and commanded the wide admiration that her
charms merited. In December, 1792, -in a box at the opera, the fateful meeting be
tween herself and Lord Edward -Fitzgerald took place, and it being a case of mutual
love they were shortly afterward married at Tournay, Louis Philippe being one of
the witnesses. . â  - . % t . . , .
. The happy couple -went to Ireland, to a place called Frescati. in County^ Dublin*
where a life of idyllic calm was at first -passed, surrounded with sweet nature's
charms, and in perfect devotion to each other. But it was not long before the polit
ical agitation of the times aroused the beautiful Pamela's interest and finally enlisted
her ardent sympathy. She began to take an active : part in the Irisn revolutionary
conspiracy, and the negotiations with the . French Government through the French
Minister at Hamburg < were largely carried on through her and Lord Edward's in
strumentality. '.:â¢â  ' â¢ â  â â â ;"-" ':â â "' : -,'â 
On the outbreak of the rebellion In 1798 Lord Edward Fitzgerald was singled out
for arrest, in the^truggle that attended hie capture he was mortally wounded
by Major Si rr. His wife was compelled to fly for her life and sought shelter in the
house of Lord Cloncurry. Here she was on the point of giving birth to a daughter
when .an edict from Dublin' Castle commanded her to , lea ye Ireland within I twenty
four Â» hours. In this hour of dire distress ; she â â  found herself utterly forsaken : not â â  a
doctor In Dublin could be induced to attend her, not a friend would dare come for
ward to render her assistance: her husband's estates were confiscated and her mon
ey and jewels had either all. been stolen or used to bribe Lord Edward's jailer.
â  Thus she. was about 'to: start : out alone. -.sad and suffering '-when a friend unex- ;
pectedly arose in the person of the Rev. John Murphy, a Protestant clergyman who
under his protection escorted her to friends ;in London. It was In token of this
kindly service that Pamela presented the Rev. Mr. Murphy with the beautiful min
iature of herself % recently sold at Sotheby sâ a poor gift, perhaps, in reward for such
noble aid. but all she had to give. .-.. â . - : . ? -,-. r .
â â _â  Lord Edward Fitzgerald died In -Newgate Jail the - following month, and poor
Pamela sorrowfully returned to the ; Continent.: sting on an allowance from her
half-brother, King Louis Philippe. She subsequently married Mr Pitcalrn a United
, States ConsuU and by him had one daughter. . By. her former marriage she had two
daughters' and- one son. ..',â .:â â â .,. .' .;â¢â .-, >r -â _â 'â â ' . â¢â â > : ...
.Her- closing years were spent In a convent at Paris, whither she had retired
broken-hearted. i; On November 9, 1831; at the age of 55 years all that remained of
the lovely and heroic Pamela was interred in Montmartre Cemetery tna V r^ raalne - 0I
v For nearly half 'a' century however her grave 'â  was unknown,' owing to a con
fusion of names by reason of the second marriage,' but In 1879 a tombstone was dis
covered by : John P. Leonard, a well-known litterateur ;of Parfs - b^arlnK the name
and title of . Pamela. Â« By reference to the burial register the record her InterWn*
was found, under name of . Pitcairn. thus setting all - doubt at rest As the crave i
had only been rented \ and : the time , limit had ; already expired, a public subscription
was started and the remains were removed to y, the peaceful little ' churchyard of
Thames Ditton, where Pamela . now lies by the side ;of her children arid within a
stone's throw of- where her grandchildren at present reside cnuaren ana wltmn a
families at his hotel on Friday, May 27.
About 300 couples filled the large dauce

NEW MOTOR THAT GETS ITS POWER FROM THE WAVES
TiTFRE is a curious sort of craft anchored off North Beach,
cÂ£se to tbe end of Taylor street. It is neither a ship nor
a boat a steamer nor a sailing vessel. All that ohe can
see is a low pontoon, just rising above the surface of the
'witer and on top is a mass of complicated macÃmery.
There are wheels, which, it may be perceived, are constantly
eoing round, and from a long pipe which projects over the side
a tiny jet of water spouts at regular intervals.
This is the new wave motor, and its inventor, James M.
Dwver' stands on the beach and proudly regards the regular
life-Uke pulsations of his little machine. He claims to have
solved the problem which has broken so many other men, and
over which so many fortunes have been spent. He, has har
nessed the waves, and points to the pontoon in proof thereof.
"I have w >rked fÂ«r years over this thing," Bald Mr Dwyer,
"and th ink 1 have got it about right now. You cau see for your
self that 'h- machine is actually doing work it is pumping
water. That is to say, it is drawing power direct from the
waves and of course", this power can be converted into any
form of force desired. If my machine wttUmmp water, it will
1 b Though r< the amount of water pumped by tlio machine seemed
to be very small, Mr. Dwyer explained that this was owing to
the smoothness of the sea in that sheltered spot ir the pon
toon was moored off Aloatraz. or in some spot where the seas
run violently, he claims to be able to get ten horsepower out of
it. In principle the affair is very simple. _
To secure economy of construction the inventor has taken
advantage of the fact that a float when tossing on the waves
exerts four different kinds of forces. There is buoyancy, push
ing force, weight ;md the reaction from the pushiag force. It
is not desirable to use all this miscellaneous collection of pow
er you get just as much advantage and get it much more cheap
ly by using weight alone. That is to say, instead of trying to
make the pontoon as buoyant and light as possible, as with a

Infantry, lately stationed at Fort Bliss,

Mrs. Frank Bodnell has gone to Wheat
land for the summer.
Miss Helen Gruenberg is visiting with
her twin sister, Mrs. Giis Kuhn, In Port-
boat, it is heavily built, so as just to float above the surface.
The weight only is utilized for the exertion of power, anfl the
punt can be very cheaply built of solid timber, for it is unnec
essary to make It water tight. Indeed, it need oe little more
than a raft, having Just flotation power enough to support the
machinery placed upon it.
The machinery is worked by means of a power line, made
fast to an anchor or to some place on shore. The line passes
over a drum which is loosely mounted on a journaled shaft pro
vided with a pawl and ratchet. When a strain comes on the
line it of course revolves the drumâ when the movement of the
pontoon releases the strain the slack is taken tip by a weight,
in this way a continuous motion is imparted to the machinery,
and a flywheel secures the regular rotation of the shaft. Any
kind of pump or air compressor may be worked on the pontoon,
or, if the machinery is set up on shore, then the power line
passes from the pontoon to the factory.
The inventor's great idea, however, Is to utilize the patent
on board the numerous lightships which are anchored off our
coasts. The lightships are always moored in rough water, and
it is obvious that a great deal of force Is lost in their constant
tossings to and fro. How to utilize this wasted power 0 Here
Mr. Dwyer avails himself of the vessel's buoyancy, and not, as
in the case of a pontoon, of her weight. All that is necessary Is
to attach a power line to the vessel's cable. This must be some
kind of flexible rope, which would not only work the machinery,
but would relieve the vessel of any sudden strain on ncr cable.
A^ the vessel rose and fell on the seas she would keep the en
gine going, storing up compressed air in tanks for use as re
quired. All the machinery of the light vessel would be worked
from thir. source, the dynamos to keep the lights going at night,
the windlass to heave in cable, the fans for ventilation, and
even the engines to move the vessel herself.
Of course an awful lot of compressed air would have to be
stored up. but then the power line, like the unpretentious wind
mill, would be always putting in its work. And everybody knows
what a lot of water a windmill can pump, though it never seems
to work very hard.

flat with a narrow graduated apron, edged about as far down as the knee with five
row's of No. 3 black sMttn ribbon, which cross at the bottom and rise up at the sides,

de beneath three rows of black satin r:l bon which run down to the waist. The
back is ornamented with chevrons of the same ribbon. Over the shoulders is a large
collar of the poplin, which is prolonged into epaulets, and is open at the front and
back of the ne^k. showing a small yoke of frilled black satin.
This costume is in good taste, the corsage is very graceful in form, and though
the satin ribbon trimming on the skirt is not novel, it is effective.

In coteries they gather, to do some
thingâa something, as a rule, that i. â 
one else has thought of. Women, old and
young, are raising money; they art- sew

racking cases of "goodies" for the front,
they are fitting out ambulances or plan
ning great funds at the disposal of the
authorities.
And each society has its own special line
of work. Some of the things these girls
and matrons are doing are unique. Fem

sacked. The range is wide. It extends
from money and linenâ severely practi

cheer the hf-arts of tired men. And such

THE MILITARY GIRL
Is
THE GIRL OF THE HOUR
e=jj=3HE girl of the moment, an athletic
| maid two short months ago, has
Jj, changed with the times and become
military. The men she goes with
hardly know her. Even her clothes,
her skirts, her hats a,nd her waists have
the spirit of the armyâ or the navyâ in
them these days, her walk is modeled
upon marching and her vocabulary of
slang and topical expression has been re
vised until two sentences out of three
hang upon martial terms.
In fact, to be armylike is the fad of the
moment, and the girl of the sets has taken
up this new idea with immense enthu
siasm. She carries it out surprisingly
well, too. Very nearly everything she
does has a military twist to it, and she
has the cleverness to put just a little of
her own personality Into each movement
or speech, so that the effect Is piquant,
graceful and odd.
Thus, with a bound the military girl
has sprung Into fashion. One of her ways
is the temporary abolition of the kissâ "so
far as other girls are concerned. Meeting
her dearest friend, she salutes in a true
army way. She does not grab her or re
mark, "You dear thing!" The arms of
both girls are raised promptly to their
hats and then shoved out with a quick
movement. Then they are dropped to
their sides, and stay there.
The walk of the military girl is marked
by a firm step forward, a rather longer
step than usual, and the shoulders are
held well back, the head steadily up, with
the eyes looking straight forward, and the
chest is thrown well out. This new type
of girl when she turns swings around
cleanly on her heels, for all the world like
a geauine army man.
The new military conversation, or,
rather, the host of military phrases, heard
these days Js exceedingly interesting. A
girl returns from some shopping expedi
tion. Eefore the war was started she
would have said very Pimply: "I'll go up
and tell mother about it." Now her phrase
is, "I'll go and give the countersign to
mother." Or, telling a sister to say such
and such to her father, she will say, "Re
port to headquarters."
"Advance into the other room" is the
proper way to put it now, and instead of
speaking of going up or down stairs, you
should say, if you would be really in
form nowadays, "I'm going aloft," or
"I'm going below."
Betaking ont's self to one s downy
couch Is expressed by the words, 1 m
going to turn in." and on the street, -when
two, three or four girls are walking to
gether, there are often to be heard these
words of command. "Right about face!
and "Forward, march!"
Such are a few of the military expres
sions of the hour among girlsâ those that
are, perhaps, the most common. There
are scores of others, and -with her visits
to the camps near New York and her con
stant study of war matters this military
vocabulary of girldom is being added to
at a rapid rate weekly. The girl who has
naval associations adds to these a bunch
of terms of the sea and the battle-ships
that Rive her conversation even more pic
turesqueness and novelty.
Yet walk and talk a la militaire are.

army and navy umbrellas for
these military girls as well. These um
breilas have handles made in precise imi
tation of a email sword handle. An even
smarter thing is to have an umbrella
handle of a real sword. Not many girls
are as fortunate as that, however.
GREAT OPPORTUNITY
For the
AMERICAN DRESSMAKER
A PET theory concerning -women is
receiving such a shock that it must
fall before the batteries of fact.
The sex is supposed by its detrac
tors to place dresa before every
other consideration in life, and perhaps
those who overhear feminine conversa
tions during the seasons of spring and
autumn shopping find ample material for
their indiscriminate conclusions. Above
all women are accused of being bound to
follow the fashions of Paris as faithfully
as the sunflower turns to her god.
No one had reckoned on the patriotism
of* the American woman. It proves to be
a stronger powfr than the dicta of the
Paris mode maker, and more potent Â»an
the charm of rustling silk and filmy lace.
Our war had not been long declared be
fore we realized the coolness of France
toward America. With -the unthinking
affection of a Newfoundland puppy, we
had fancied that France was our eternal
aister.
An evidence of her amity toward us
stands in our finest harbor, and we have
been in the habit of planning trips to
Paris as often as convenience permitted,
ontfl we no longer repudiated such an ex
pressions as "All good Americana hope
to go to Paris when they die."
One day our wondering eyes read in the
newspapers preposterous hints about the
possibility of France withdrawing her loy
alty to America, and we discredited the
rumors, classing them 'among many Irri
tating and worthless reports. But It is,
alas! too true. Because of jealousy or for
financial reasons France has seriously
murmured sotto voce, "A bas les Ameri
'â ains!"
--American women living in Paris write
indignant letters on the subject, com
plaining of spiteful treatment in shops
and elsewhere; and. if not detained by
business, they move away from their un
fomfortable surroundings.
Women who spend large sums yearly In
Paris, whether crossing the ocean them
--â¢lves or sending the orders to those
â¢lressmakers who havt their measure, at
last became indignant.
The relation between the Paris creator
of confections and the American woman
la as intimate as that between Wall street
;ind the Stock Exchange, and in the past
has been as interdependent. But if France
prefers to favor Spain because she floats
her bonds we can certainly dispense with
her millinery. The dressmakers of Paris
have relied upon American custom for the
prosperity of their bouses, and now art
making clamorous protest against the
withdrawal of their fair customers.
Paris housts prefer American custom to
any other, fur Americans spend gener
ously, are honest and prompt in payments
and." more than all, wear their clothing
with a grace and style seen on no other
women in the world except the Parisienne
nr the Viennese. We have universally
good taste, and. notwithstanding all that
is snid to the contrary, our women of the
high world dress with appropriateness. H
cannot be that these talents are Imported.
We may import the clothing, but the
gift of wearing it must be innate.
Modes are composed in Paris by an in
tricate process, which has placed the
originator in a position as closely allied
to art as is that of other decorators. In
the atelier of the composer are stuffs and
laces, old and new, in infinite coloring
and texture. Books of costumes, pictur
ing drapery and dress from the earliest
ages to the present day. are close at hand
from which to draw suggestions. Be
sides this there are always public events
occurring, the picturc-snue side of which
can be reflected in modes. These things
furnish the inspiration which creates the
styles, which are imitated with more or
less fidelity throughout the civilized
world.
The question arises. Can we not do this
work as well in America? Now. it seems
to me, is the grand opportunity for
\merican dresmaskers to assert them
selves. They have hitherto been forced
into copying, although perfectly capable
of originating. Some of our highest class
American dressmakers have composed
exquisite creations for their customers,
but have never succeeded as they should,
because the indispensable mark of Paris
was missing.
NJbw. what is this magic mark? It is
the approval given to the compositions of
the masters by their adoption by a cer
tain class of women in Paris, and this
not a desirable class. One immense ad
vantage the originator of modes in Amer
ica would have is this, that here the
cachet is given by the women highest in
social position. We have ample oppor
tunity in New York life for setting the
mode. The races of the Grand Prix in
Paris indicate the fashions for the entire
year following. The note of color and
the mold of form is then set, and from
this proceed innumerable variations.
Surely our annual horse show in New
York would give similar opportunity on
this side of the water. It does so now,
with this exception, that the modes are
all imported.
It would be very difficult to say why all
the world copies Paris fashions. If any
one thinks the styles which emanate
from that place are artistic or based on
lines of enduring beauty, let him pick up
a fashion magazine half a dozen years
old and note the ugliness in form and
color that is never apparent when the
mode is at its height. Surely we in
America could make no worse color com
binations than those which have dazzled
the eyes in the department of millinery
during the present season.
One of our New York women, promi
nent in both social and philanthropic
movements, has set out to unite the
women of this country in a boycott of
French milliners and dressmakers. Her
name carries influence and she will have
many followers. This should delight the
heart of the American dressmaker and
should dignify the profession by drawing
into it many who are capable or creating.
There is an opportunity to-day which
will never occur again. A strong and
active prejudice exists at this juncture
against the usual source of supply.
Women must have tasteful and elegant
clothing, and here Is the opportunity for
home talent to supply it. We have been
mere copyisip, but now have the oppor
tunity to originate. The taste of our
cultivated people Is undisputed, so we are
not likely to fall in that regard. Piquant
feminine touches to the toilet are quite aa
characteristic of us as they are of the
French, and we have the advantage,
which suits our practical people, of con
sidering utility.
COMPLEXIONS FOR
THE SUMMER GIRL
THERE is probably nothing that
can cause the cummer girl more
unhappiness and mortification of
spirit than a freckled face. Were
each one of those little grolden
spots a Klondyke nugget, I doubt if it
would console her for having to march
through life with a face speckled like a
guinea hen's eggs.
Before I give the recipes promised last
Sunday, let me say that there are two
kinds of freckles â summer or "sun
freckles" and winter or "cold freckles. "
The first are ephemeral, the second
chronic. If the recipe given in last Sun
day's Call was not satisfactory, and
glycerine, I know, does not agree with all
skinsâ then try the following:
Fresh lemon juice.
Rosewater.
Rectified spirit.
Equal parts.
Mix together and the next day decant
the clear portion and strain through mus
lin. Bathe the face with it night and
morning, wiping the face afterward with
a soft towel.
Or this:
g Sal-ammoniac (powdered) 1 drachm. O
Distilled water. 1 pint. O
O Kau de Cologne, 2 fluid drachms. O
O Mix and apply with a rag, night Â©
0 and morning. 0
In some cases these little brown spots
are very persistent and resist all efforts
to remove them, as long as the skin con
tinues to be exposed to the sun. Keep
out of the sun. girls, If you are afflicted
in this way, or else wear a chiffon veil
when courting its rays.
The other variety, known as "cold
freckles." come from disordered health or
some disturbance of the natural func
tions of the skin and are less easy to deal
with.
Now, then, girls, how many of you take
a daily sponge bath? There is nothing I
can prescribe that will assist you so ma
terially in the attainment of a fine com-
I^exion as baths, and plenty of them.
They are the greatest cosmetic in the
world.
Addison says: "Beauty commonly pro
duces love; but cleanliness preserves it."
And to my mind, cleanliness comes before
godliness. I do not mean that I think it
discounts in its results physically the
practice of all the virtues, but I do think
you have to be clean before you can be
good.
You must. In order to maintain perfect
health, without which no one can be
beautilul, keep the pores of the skin
thoroughly clean. This cannot be accom
plished by an occasional scrub, but must

/"^ AROLINE P.â Tour woolen gown of the
| new intense blue, known as national blue,
| is capable of many effective results in
Uthe way of combination with other col
ors. Do not use another blue, as you
mention, for vest, collar and revers, as
any other color other than a shade of itself
is in better style this season. A very vivid
shade of green showing golden lights is one of
the newest ideas in combination with this
blue, and a pinkish heliotrope is very smart if
the color is becoming; white, too. Is used on the
deep blue summer gowns. Would make a

about an eighth of an inch In width, and
spaced once and a half their width. Tuck it
until the line of the bust has been passed, and
from there allow it to blouse to the waist line,
where it must be held quite firm. Tuck stand

Elizabeth Browne.â To make an old black
summer serge gown look like new, first rip
carefully. Take ten cents' worth of soap bark
(which can be bought at any drug store) and
soak over night in two quarts of boiling water.
Next morning strain well and add a gallon of
boiling water, allowing It too cool sufficiently to
bear the hands in washing. Take the dress
goods, one width at a time, and wash by
squeezing it in the hands and swishing It in
and out of the water. Do not rub it or the
edges will stretch out of shape. Rinse lightly

end only. When partially dry. lron on the

seven inches.
E. E. K-â ln answer to your question of how
lo keep a waist from wrinkling under the arm
and tom-ard the front when the outside is made
full over a tight lining, the first precaution to
make Is to be sure that the grain of the lining
and the grain of the outside material run pre
cisely alike. That is, after the lining has been
properly cut, with a perfectly straight grain of
the goods running from the shoulder to the
waist line, baste the outside material to this in
the same way; that is, the grain of the goods
running straight from the same points. Baste
the seams together without stretching. In fit
ting the fronts work the fullness forward and
down as near the edge of the fronts as possi
ble, holding it firmly down at the lowest point
of the waist line. Should there then be any
email wrinkles under the arm. draw the out

However, a tepid sponge is more likelj
to agree with every oneâ a daily tepid

Hot baths are not enervating unlesi

The way to get the best result from
this bath is to be in it a few momenta

this, before drying thoroughly with t

Margaret G.â "How can I fit a dress skirl
so that it will not poke out in front at tht
bottom?" Cut your dress skirt at least twi
inches and a half longer than you wish whel

any wider than the measurement from the bac!
dart on one side of the front fo the waist tÂ«
the back dart of the other side at the walsi

Is the slightest poke in the front, raise th,
skirt Just at the hip swell, and the bottom o!
the dress skirt will hang evenly and straiglv
across. If you have made no allowance foi
this raise on the hips, by taking a dart oi

did. After the addresses the guests were
taken to an adjoining hall, where they
were treated to a sumptuous collation,
and at the close there was so much left
that each soldier was given a package to
take to camn.

COMPANIONS OF TH.E FOREST, F.

The session of the Grand Circle, C. O. F.
of A., which closed last Thursday, was a
â¢very harmonious one. It Is expected that
lr^,w. Coburn, tho new. grand chief, with J
solution. The famous story has twice
I been translated into Japanese, once liter
! ally, and again In the words of a Jiipanese
I story-teller, and the story-tellers of
; Hurma still find It one of the best In their
I repertoires. The Burmese says Its "local
1 color" Is correct. Mr. Stockton himself
tells of a missionary who related the
, story to a tribe of Karens up In the north
of Burma. When she came back, a year
later, the tribe surrounded her and want
;ed to know if she had found out yet
whether it was the lady or the tiger.
As to "The Girl at Oobhurst." she's the
ugly duckling of the Stockton literary
; family. Being the child of such a father,
i the very brilliancy of her sisters empha
. sizes her lack of distinction, of grace, of
I wit. If she were not related to such
clever people her defects would not be so
noticeableâ but neither would she. The
, llrst half of the book which meanders on
; in the leisurely Stocktonlan way has no
real bearing upon the story. And the real
story, the struggle between the old
French cook and the autocratic match
maker of the town, which might have
been deliclously funny, is robbed of its
real value because the element of sur
prise, of climax. Is lacking.
In "The Girl at Cobhurst" Stockton had
a plot for a farce as clever, as original as
any of the ideas that have come from his
busy brain. He lengthened and sobered
it into a pastoral, photographic tale, and
so spoiled it. It remains for some one to
seize upon the capital rivalry of these two
old women, a disinterested rivalry for the
possession of a husbandâ not for either
of the two, but for the girl each was in
terested Inâ and turn its flow of oppor
tunity for good situation and dramatic
possibilities back into the channel where
ft would have done most good and been
so conducive to the gayety of nations.
Just a little accentuation, just a bit of
clever character work, just a hint of
caricature in Miss Panney and Mine. L.c
Fleur, and to the stage would be added
two delightful creations; while literature.
In losing "The Girl at Cobhurst," would
lose nothing she mightn't easily replace.
What occurred between Dora and Miss
Panney when the former declares her in
tentions Stockton has not described at
all. On the stage that might be made a
capital scene. Imagine a girl going to
the autocratic, wealthy old maid and ask
ing her help in the campaign against the
man Dora wishes to marry. Imagine her
confusionâ for Dora Is not a villainâ the
keen-oyed. sharp-tongued old match
maker's pleasure In the proceeding and
the details of the plot they might con
coct. The tea berry gown. too. is an ef
fective piece of stage property, whose
| light is hid under a bushel in a book. And
the possibilities in that clever Le Fleur,
: I'rmed. as she is, with the most potent
v.Â»-aponâ her knowledge of cookeryâ are
simply tantalizing for an actress with
brains and wit enough to see and em
brace such an opportunity.
Who'll dramatize "The Girl at Cob
hurst"? Who'll reveal the excellent com
! edy that Stockton thought and didn't
i write? Who'll uncover the clever idea
that lies suffocated beneath the dust of
dull village gossip by commonplace peo
ple of commonplace things?

will make at least as good a record as did
the Junior past chief companion and those
who assisted her. The re-election of Miss
Bremer as financial secretary appears to
have given great satisfaction, as also has
the selection of Mrs. L. Atwood, one of
the most Indefatigable workers in the or
der, for the OL..C* of recording secretary.
The special team that was selected to
exemplify the work of initiation before
! the delegates to the Grand Circle in the
' hall of Inter Nos Circle on the evening of
i last Wednesday covered itself with glory.
All the members of the team, attired in
white dresses with neat corsage bouquets,
presented a very pretty sight, something
that has never before been seen in a
circle room. Every member of the team
was letter perfect in the delivery of the
memorized work, and the floor work of
the guides could not be excelled. The
work was very favorably commented up
on, and at a banquet given on Thursday
night there was an open acknowledgment
by the committee that selected the team
of the excellence of the work that was
done by the team composed of Mrs. O.
Loft, Mrs. Cora Weisel. Mrs. L. Atwood,
Miss May Bailey, Miss Lorvea. Miss Rose
Reynolds, Miss Wlshman, Miss Rappin
and Miss Lefevro, with Messrs. Loft and
Erricks. who volunteered as guards.
Ferrucio Circle, organized by Frank de
Julio, was instituted in Washlngton
square Hall last Thursday night by Grand
Chief Companion Mrs. Harrington, as
sisted by Grand Secretary Miss Bremer
and a number of the grand officers, nearly
all of whom together with members of
other circles were present during the cere- |
mony. The circle, which will be auxiliary
to Court Ferrucio of the Foresters of
America, had thirty members at the in
stallation and will add five more at the
next meeting. The membership is all
young people and many of the lady com
panions are far above the usual type of
pretty women.
A new circle was instituted last Tues
day night in San Jose by Grand sub-Chief
Companion Coburn with a good member

Tne American Forester was at the ses
sion of the Grand Circle adopted as- the
official organ of the order for California.
The action of Excelsior Circle in pre
paring a wagon-load of wearing apparel
and provisions for the volunteers at
Camp Merrltt last week was taken on the
suggestion of Mrs. J. J. Cordy, and the
committee that superintended the deliv
ery was Mrs. J. J Cordy, Mrs. Julia
Wlshman, Mrs. M. Shumacher and Mrs.
E. Short and Grand Secretary Cordy of
the Foresters.
The ball that was given by the conven
tion of '98 to the delegates to the Grand
Circle In Alcazar Social Hall last Friday
evening was a very successful affair that
was enjoyed by the large number who at
tended and participated in the well-ar
ranged programme of dances.
THE BANQUET OF '98.
The banquet given last Thursday night
in Westerfeld's by the convention of 1898
to the de-legates to the Grand Circle of the
Companions of the Forest of America ajid
to the Incoming and outgoing grand offi
cers was one of the best appointed af
faira of the kind that has ever been given
in the order. The menu was excellent, the
service of the best, and the Mat of toasts
offered by a member of Inter Nos Circle
who acted as toastmaster were appropri
ate to the occasion and were well received,
while the responses were listened to with
marked attention. During the evening
Mrs. Harrington, the retiring grand chief
companion, was presented by Mrs. L.
Atwood, the grand recording secretary,
on behalf of the grand circle, a handsome
silver tea set. This was In the nature of
a surprise, and the recipient after listen
ing to the high praise paid her forthegood
work Bhe did during her term, could only
utter her thanks. It was admitted that
she worthily deserved the token of rec
ognition offered her. Those who respond
ea to the toasts were Mrs. Harrington,
Grand Chief Companion I. W. Couurn,
Grand Sub-Chief Mrs. F. Jacobs. Grand
Trustees Mrs. Kemp Van Ec, Mrs. Da

The banquet closed with the singing of
the "Star-spangled Banner." One of the
most interesting speakers of the evening
was Mrs. McLouth, who responded to
"Our Country, and What the Compan
ions of the Forest of America Can Do
to Show Loyalty to the Flag That Floats
Over the Land of the Free, the Home of
the Brave, and Will Soon Float Over the I
Land of the Oppressed." It was a patri
otic and eloquent effort, which was sup- !
piemented with an original poem about !

which worked well and produced excel- I
htnt results, was Dr. W. A. Atwood, Mrs. j

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JUNE 5, 1898.
THE UNQUIET SEX,
BY HELEN WATTERSON MOODY
HELEN WATTERSON MOODY 1b
that rare thing In male or female
authorshipâ an essayist; a writer,
sane, unaffected by fads, with a
calm, logical mind and a sense ol
humor, capable of taking a comprehensive
view of things, with a point not too far
elevated above mankind, and an easy
style of expression, not so severe as to
lack charm and not so untrammeled as to
lack dignity.
"The Unquiet Sex" Is a prettily bound
little volume devoted to the discussion of
women and the place they occupy in the
doing and thinking world just now. The
author, with that philosophy which Is the
essayist's most entertaining andâ to the
disputantsâ most irritating quality, refuses
to take sides, and while she quietly and
wittily points out the humorous aspects
of the "discovery of women" declines to
praise or to condemn wholesale.
"I know the argument to the contrary,"
she writes of the woman collegian, "I
used to write about it myself, and be
lieve It, too; but that was before the
serious days settled down upon me, when
I would gladly have exchanged my small
birthright of Latin and Greek for the
ability to make one single, respectable
mess of anything half bo good as pot
tage." Still, despite her self-conscious
ness, the college woman is Justified. "The
education she wanted she has had; It was
right and just that she should have it,
and it has done her good. Possibly It
will do her still more good when she is
able to forget it."
The chapter on women's clubs Is the
pleasantest example of this clever
woman's style.
'I asked Ernesta the other day to de
fine a woman's club, to give the club idea,
feminine, In as few words as possible. She
thought profoundly for some minutes,
then said: 'A woman's club is an associa
tion for the purposes of mutual helpful
ness and self-Improvement.' â¢ * â¢ Then
1 asked a man to define a man's club.
'Well,' he said, 'upon reflection, a club is
something you join in order that you may
stay away from It when you like.' "
From this she deduces the superiority of
the man In his capacity for enjoyment,
and in her picture of the ideal woman's
club she declares:
"Here no Insidious desire for work
should be allowed to masquerade under
the guise of recreation, and no amount of
recreation would serve to carry any ul
terior purpose of self-Improvement. There
would be luncheon for luncheon's sake,
and women would sit down to eat it,
greedy and unashamed. And you may be
sure there would be no papers to read and
no members lined because they were not
there to listen to them."
In "The Case of Maria" Is a practical
suggestion for the solution of the prob
lem of domestic servants, in the separa
tion of their dwelling place from that of
their employer. "Until women shall have
given some evidence of some small politi
cal sagacity, some desire for reform." she
concludes, "and a very little rapacity for
organization In that department of the
world's sociology with which the home Is
concerned, there Is no glaring Injustice In
denying them a share In the government
of the country."

THE JUNE
MAGAZINES.
The trail of the war is over the maga
zines. Scribner's publishes some excel
lent war maps and makes
announcement that the
tireless Richard Harding
Davis, though serving as
corespondent for three
great newspapers, will be

already written "The First

! whether your point of view Is the estheti

you'll call the story well written. Gib

number, In which he presents morning
I types to be found In Gotham.
The Pall Mall for June is unusually
well illustrated, even for the Pall Mall,
whose ordinary illustra-
I tlon is a lesson and an
I example to magazine-
I makers. But the flower
of the flock, literary and
artistic, that fills this
magazine, is the next to
the last Installment of
Anthony Hope's "Rupert
of Hentzau," which has
such a delightfully fas
cinating "Prisoner of
Zenda" flavor that the
race of fearful antago-
nists to sequels might
take heart and change their literary creed
as to the unapproachableness of one s
I first idol.
Julian Ralph's account of the trans
siberian railway is the leader of Harper's
this month. It is well 11-
lustrated and brings nome
to one the vastness, the
peculiarities and the pow
er of Russia. Apart from
ihe war articles there isn't
a subject of more import
ance in the â  magazine
world to-day. Ralph's
conclusion is as follows:
"Let the visitor to Russia
pursue his comparisons
until, as nearly every one
fails, he concludes that
he must be doing Russia
an injusticeâ until he comes to re
flect that the basis and roots of
! its civilization are Asiatic and not
European. Let him once say 'Russia
is Asiatic' â¢ â¢ â¢ then he stops criticiz
ing and begins admiring. He is not in the
last and most primitive corner of Europe.
He is in the first and most advancing
country of Asia." The most effective bit
of Illustration in the magazine this
month Is a sketch by Frederic Kemlng
ton of "Ye Spirit Dog."
The Century Is the banner magazine for
June. It prints Emory Fcnn's "Ten
Months with the Cuban
Insurgents," two interest-
Ing articles on Daly's

a most picturesque view
of Klondike school boy
and girl life, Bret Harte's
"Passing of Enrlquez,"
and 'â¢The Spanish Ar
mada." to which Captain
Alfred Mahan, the great
naval tactician, writes
an Introduction. He at-
tributes the failure of
the armada "to the following causes:
1. The failure to proscribe the ef
fectual crippling of the English navy
as a condition precedent to any attempt 'â¢
at lnvusion. 2. The neglect to secure be- I
forehand v suitable point lor making: the '
junction with the army. Combinations ;
thus intrusted to chance have no right to
expect success. 3. The several actions
with the English failed because the ships,
which could exert their power only close
to the enemy, were neither so fast nor so
handy as the latter. Only those who have
the advantage of range can afford infe
riority of speed. 4. The disasters in the
Atlantic were due either to original un
seaworthiness, or to damage received In
action or to bad judgment in taking un
weatherly ships too close to the shores of
Ireland, where strong westerly gales pre
vailed, and the coast was inhospitable."

Lummis gives the names of

literary league, and heads it with that of
David Starr Jordan, of whom he ways:
There has not been in the Intellectual
development of the West such another
one-man momentum as David Starr Jor
dan, president of Stanford University,
nor is there to-day in any one personality
anywhere a saner, stronger, more vital
force making for better life and better
thought." Charles Warren Stoddard. Ina

Fitch, literary editor of the San Fran

have pledged themselves to help make

West; an ambition which the active, vig
orous, clever head of the league has long
cherished.

THIRTY STRANGE STORIES
BY H. G. WELLS.
IT's enough to make one forgive Mr.
Wells' having written "The War of
the Worlds"; In fact, it's enough to
make one entertain the possibility of
reading the latest book by this au
thor, despite Its unearthly adventures,
its inhuman characters, its flying ma
chines, its Martian invaders and its glori
fication of the microbe, to become ac
quainted with the excellence of these
short stories.
Since Bulwer led the fashion in strange
I stories, these grown-up fairy tales for
! adults have appeared In all shapes and
disguises. Sometimes their development
has uncovered the author'B plotâan alto
j gether distinct thing from the story's
I plotâto preach at the unarmed reader, so
powerless to talk back. Sometimes it has
been a fad of his that he forces upon one
| through the mouths of supernatural
j beings, as if that made the fad itself
easier to swallow. Sometimes it has been
the inculcation of knowledge, that in
sidious enemy of easy-going mental pleas
i ures. Sometimes it has been purely for*
the imaginative fun of it that the scien
tific Jules Verne, and the moralist Jules
i Verne, and the political â¢ Jules Verne,
j and the optimistic Jules Verne,
; and the artistic Jules Verne nave
j beckoned us on to the supernatural and
1 led us through the domain of the marvel-
I ous, till our literary souls have been sa
tiated with the wonderful, and it is only
, with the moHt languid interest that we
follow, afraid of being bored by old com
; blnatlons, anticipating the climax and be
j littling the magic of it all.
The antidote for it all is Mr. Wells'
"AepyornlÃ Island," a simple, efficacious
and most delightful remedy. So delightful,
in fact, that it's worth having been poi
soned in order to require the antidote.
"Aepyornis Island" is the ta-le of an
other Lost Ingenue, as Elbert Hubbard
calls the Dodo. But such a graceful story
of the graceless Aepyornis, of its shocking
ingratitude and of us foster-father's trials
as it is! So permeated with humor, so
thoroughly logical and so consistently
impossible Is the simple narration of the
finding of an egg of this bird, extinct for
3000 years. Its hatching in the warm sun,
the companionship between the castaway
and this representative of ornithological
bluest blood, that it might serve as a
model to strange story writers for all
time.
The author's account of the catastrophe
is charming. "Think of the shame of it,
too!" he says. "Here was this extinct
animal mooning about my island like a
sulky Duke, and me not allowed to rest
the sole of my foot on the place. I used
to cry with weariness and vexation. I told
him straight that 1 didn't mean to be
chased about a desert island by any
anachronism. I told him to go
and peck a navigator of his own age. But
h* only snapped his beak at me. Great,
ugly birdâall leg and neck!"
So then he killed his fourteen-foot-high
feathered Frankenstein, and this is the
result: "Good Lord! You can't Imag
ine how I missed that bird. 1 sat by
his corpse and sorrowed over him.

to work independently of the Red Cross
Society. The ladies nf the hive will make

for the present comfort of the soldiers.
These articles will b* taken to the camp
and delivered to the officers for distribu

The hive also decided to create a relief
fund for the benefit of families of the I
members of the Maccabees who have or
shall enlist for the war. This work will
be the special fraternal work of the hive,

NEW EDITION OF
THACKERAY'S "PENDENNIS."
THE new edition of Thackeray the
Harpers are publishing is notable
mainly for the biographical notes
by Thackeray's daughter and hith
erto unpublished letters of the
greatest of English story tellers.
The Pendennis volume has an account of
Thackeray's school days. "I can remem
ber," says Mrs. Ritchie, "hearing my
grandfather say that Euclid was like
child's play to my father, who went
through the first books with absolute ease
ami facility. Algebra, nn the contrary, he
always disliked, and there were other sub
jects he turned from; for instance, he de
clared to the end of his life that he never
could understand the difference between
latitude and longitude."
In distinctly Pendennia reminiscence,
the r â -'â¢'- )s not so rich as was "Vanity
Fair," but there are
numerous humorous
sketches, the design
for a Hogmagundy
being a testimony to
Thackeray's carica
turing ability.
"There were Pen
dennises and Warring
tons, too, at Cam
bridge in the year
1829, the year Thack
eray was at Cam
bridge," Mrs. Ritchie
writes. "Dobbin was
there also, in another
colored coat. Al
though they did not
* become intimate un-
MRS.RiCHMONu .MCHiEtil after they had
left college, my father's relations to
Edward Fitzgerald had perhaps some
resemblance to those of Pendennis
and Warrington; and yet, my father was
not Pendennfs any more than the other
was Warrington."
In this introduction also are the names
of those who posed unconsciously for
Laura and Pendennis.
"In those days there was a little girl
living at Brighton, a charming little girl
with dark eyes and curly brown hair; and
I have often heard the story how she
came running into the room and said her
name was Laura, and how my father then !
and there made her godmother to his I
heroine. She was the youngest daughter j
uf Horace Smith, of. the Rejected Ad
dresses.' Little Laura married Mr. John
Round, and died still young, still dark
eyed, gay and charming.
"Nor must I forget to mention a vis
itor who used to come to Kensington in I
the very early days of Pendennis. He |
was a father short, good-looking young :
man, with a fair, placid face. It was I
summer time and we dined at an early j
hour; and one day after dinner, by day
light still, my father pulled out his sketch
book and began to make a drawing of his :
guest. This was a young literary man :
just beginning his career; his name was
Charles Lamb Kenny, and we were told j
that he was to be the hero of the new i
book, or rather, that the hero was to look !
like Mr. Kenny."
Pendennis was finished in 1850. "Having '
I lodge of the Friends of the Forest, will
i hereafter hold Its meetings on the second
i and fourth Friday evenings at Mission
1 Masonic Hall, Twenty-third and Mission
! streets.
This order is progressing nicely, and in
the near future expects to institute a new
! lodge in Texas.

WHIST
PRACTICAL ADVICE TO WHIST PLAYERS.
LAST week we gave some practical ad
vice to those who are put In charge of
whist tournaments, contests, matches,
etc., and how they can help make
them much more popular. This week
we think It our duty to say a few
words to the players themselves who
take part In such tournaments. They, too.
| have a part to perform, and they should per
â¢ form It well.
It is as necessary for the players to do their
i duty 0s it Is for the referee, or one in charge,
! to do his. Like a pair of shears, the two halves
I must be perfectly united to do good work, and
have everything cut or run smoothly.
LSefore enu-rlns a tournament or match game
you should carefully read the laws of dupli
cate whist, and become familiar with them.
j and play strictly in accordance with the same.
When you make up your mind to enter a
i whlÂ«t contest, and the rules require you to
j make a formal entry, don't wait until the last
! minute to do so.
When you do enter, you should give the name
of your club, where it Is from, the captain's
name first, then follow with the full names
of each of your team; don't omit the given
i name or Initials. This little request may seem
I trifling to some, but it is a labor saving device
for the referee and scorers.
Pm the strictest attention to the announce
ments of the referee: if you don't understand
what he tells you the first time, have It re-
P "n \>laver should go on playing In a match
when he' does not know what Is expected of
him In regard to scoring, moving or changing
' l n shmfl'd %c' the duty of every player enter-
Ing a match to assist the one In charge as
much as possible by doing what he is told to
do, and do It cheerfully nnd at once.
Always play your cards with as little delay
as possible "and do Justice to yourself and
'â  partner. Playing unnecessarily slow is a great
I aggravation at a whist tableâ you make the
I game a bore to every one around you Instead of
I a pleasure. â 
Never touch any cards on the table during
the play of a deal except your own; if you are
entitled to see any cards that have been
turned, ask the player to show them.
I'oint the ends of the cards to the winner of
each trick; some players have a habit of plac
ing the cards of a trick won, in one pile, and
the cards of a trick lost in another: this Is con
trary to the law and should not be allowed at
a whist table.
To prevent mistakes in scoring, both sides
should state In a low whisper as soon as a
| deal Is played the number of tricks won by
i each; be sure that you agree before touching
the cards. Never speak loud enough to be
I heard at the next table.
Be sure that the score Is recorded before you
touoh your cards to put them back Into the
tray or holder.
When a deal has been played and the score
recorded and vouched for, each player should
j thoroughly mix the cards and put them back
I In the pocket of the tray at once, and let them
i remain there.
It 1b the duty of each player at a table to
watch to see no mistake occurs In putting down
the score.
If a mistake Is made In putting down a
score, It should never be erased: the referee
should be called to furnish a new score slip â
the one on which the mistake occurs should be
handed to him to destroy.
When you "O. K." or vouch for your ad
versaries' score, which must be done at the
end of each round, you should write your full
name: don't put down Just your Initials.
When the scores at a tnble are made up
properly vouched for by each adversary, they
should be placed handy for the collector.
Never post-mortem a deal after you have
played it whrn It has to be moved to another
table for play; you not only disturb players
around you, but nine times out of ten you will
get the cards mixed.
Never during a contest or match of any kind
ask a player at another table what he made on
any certain deal: Invariably some one hears
the reply that has yet to play It.
Should a question arise over which there
can be any misunderstanding or dispute, ap
peal at once to the referee: don't wait until
you have attracted the attention of all play
ers in the room.
If. In the course of piny, you make what is
RÂ»nernlly known as "j-lam hand,' keep It to
yourself.
lr a player Is ignorant of the law on any par
ticular point, he has the riyht to consult or
refer to a printed code to post him, even dur
ing a contest.
Bear In mind a referee Is not for the purpose
of quoting the law to those Ignorant of It, ex
cept In making his decisions. He is there to (
completed my story this day," Thacke
ray wrote to his mother, "and wrote finis,
I am very tired, weary and solemn-mind
ed." Mrs. Ritchie says she can remember
"the morning Helen died. He came into
our schoolroom half-laughing and half
ashamed and said to us. "I do not know
what James can have thought of me when
he came in and found me blubbering over
Helen Pendennls" death.' "
Thackeray was fiercely criticized for
trying to win favor with the non-literary
classes by decrying his own profession.
In replying to the attack made upon him
he wrote:
"The only moral that I. as a writer,
wished to hint at in the description
against which you protest, was that it is
the duty of a literary man, as well as of
every other, to practice regularity and
sobriety, to love his family, to pay his
tradesmen. Nor is the picture I have
drawn a 'caricature which I condescend
to.' My attempt was to tell the truth and
to tell it not unkindly. I have seen the
bookseller whom Bludger robbed of his
books. I have carried money, and from a
noble brother-man-of-letters. to some
one not unlike Shandon in prison, and
have watched the beautiful devotion of
his wife in that dreary place. Why are
these things not to be described, if theyil
lustra.e, as they appear to me to do, that
strange and awful struggle which takes
place in our hearts and in the world?"

WHIST MATCH BY CORRESPONDENCE.
Whist, the Journal that every whister In the
country watches so anxiously for each month,
has started the long-looked-for whist tourna
ment by correspondence. We are afraid it has
made a serious mistake at the start by asking
us to be one of the contestantsâ as a "long
suiter."
The details of the tournament are as fol
lows, as furnished by the above journal:
Sixteen players take ;iart in the tourney,
eight long-suit players being opposed to eight
short-suit players. Four tables are formed, and
at each table a long-suit pair will meet a short
suit pair. There will be no change of position â
every player having the same partners and
same adversaries throughout the tourney.
Each player will play 100 hands, acting in
turn as leader, second, third and fourth hand.
A set of numbered whist blanks are sent to
every player, and each blank will show tha
hand to be played on a given deal and the po
sition of the player. These are to be retained
by the player for reference.
The tourney will be diveded into four sec
tions (A. B. C and D) of twenty-five hands
each, and with each section will be sent a
duplicate set of blanks to be filled up and
returnedâ thus, north at table 1 will receive
the twenty-five diagrams that form section A,
showing his cards and position on each deal.
At the same time he will receive an explanation
of the system of play adopted by his partner
and adversaries (as stated by themselves) and
a separate set of blanks for those deals In sec
tion A In which It Is his turn to play â in this
case It would be deals 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21 and 25.
He would enter his cards In the rroper spaces
and return the second set to this office In the
stamped envelope enclosed for the purpose. At
this office the cards played by north would be
noted In our diagrams and then transferred
to the blanks for east, and forwarded to him.
When received back the cards played by north
and east are entered upon souths set of
blanks and sent away, and so onâ always in
sets of six or seven at a time.
One person only will know all the players
and all the hands; one hand in every four is
an arranged hand, the remaining 39 cards be
ing shuffled and mixed, till they as nearly as
possible realized the ideal equivalent of being
"Bhot out of a volcano" before they were dealt
for the other three hands. Nevertheless we
question If the most enreful design could In
some cases have produced combinations more
curious or more likely to result in some ex
ceedingly Interesting play.
Every combination will be opened In turn
by two long-suit teams against a short-suit
defense, and by two short-suit teams against
a long-suit defense. The leaders' hands are
so framed as In afford long and short suiters
alike the best possible opportunity of proving
which system gives the best results from a
given combination, whether it be opened with
a supporting card or a fourth best, a number
showing lead or "top o' nothing."

WHIST BY HARVARD, YALE AND PRINCETON
The Intercollegiate whist tournament recently
held by Harvard, Yale and Princeton was a
great success. Harvard finished first, Yale
second. Mr. Howard Rogers, whist editor of
the Evening Journal of Albany, N. V., says:
"In their struggle for the champ â  nship the
college boys showed remarkably good discipline,
and the match was one of the mnFt orderly
and business-like ever played. There was not
a word of comment among the players that
could be hr-ard at the next table, and what
I'ttle fault-finding took place was more in the
way of good-natured regret than of criticism.
The players changed their placrs expeditlously,
kept their scores with rPm;irknWe accuracy,
and attended strictly to the play In n mnnner
that would put many of our older organizations
to the blush.
"The Harvards undoubtedly won the match
by superior play. They were better strategists
and seemed better able to read the cards than
either of tbe teams from the other colleges."IN THE LOWER THEATRICAL HEAVENS

terest, and the degree varies from the
half-smile, or the unconcealed grin, to
the belated ha! ha: that begins the
laugh all over again.
A late writer on the Decline of Ene:- â 
lish Comedy attributes the melancholy |
result to a pnssion for decency, a puri
tanical insistence upon gentility that
h;i.s crowded out the burly, good na
tured, easy-going farcical delegate to
the congress of theatrical representa
tion. No one can accuse the French
of prudery, and yet, if we're to judge
by the translations offered us, their
comedies are even worse than ours, for
they lack in wit and in decency, too.
Kendall's method suits his audience.
He knows that to allude to the neces
sity of a mackintosh for the engineer
on "that railroad with the short curves
will not offend, for the -majority of his
listeners have no imagination, and |
those that are blessed with the divine
attribute leave it at home, together
with other mental qualities that would
be out of place. here. You go to the
Orpheum to be amused, and the clever
ness with which vaudeville is conduct
ed nowadays is evidenced by the fact
that all softs and conditions of people
find entertainment here.
It's amusing to see the way Kendall
drives every witticism, pun or innu
endo home. Nothing is wasted. The
good thing is said, and the br
6mooth face, with its keen, small eyes
and thin-lipped mouth, is turned seri
ously upon his laughing audience. And
then, to clinch the jok^. to bring in the
stragglers who recognize funny things
slowly and with great difficulty, there's
an additional dry word or phrase, a
sort of sequel, a completion that makes
the laugh unanimous.
Mr. Kendall's plagiarism in his "orig
inal monologue" is quite allowable. The
monologuist becomes the fin de siecle
bard who gives a verbal epigram to
the public, the majority of whom would
never know otherwise about the poet,
for instance, whose name embodies the
fate in store for Ingersoll; and sundry
i-ther jokes whose effect is not a whit
1< ssened because they are told by the
man who didn't originate them.
It is too early in the season to give
a complete list of what we have in
view for the Baldwin Theater, writes
the management, but thus far we have
secured several of Mr. Frohman's at
tractions, including "The Sign of the
Cross," Henry Miller; 'Secret Service"

"Sporting Duchess," Augustus Pitou'.s
attractions, "The Circus Girl," De Wolf

RED CROSS BENEFIT AT THE PRESS CLUB.
THE art students of San Francisco
have created a widespread interest
among art lovers in their prepara
tions for the coming exhibition for
the benefit of the boys In blue. The
exhibition and sale of pictures will
take place at the rooms of the Press Club
next Saturday afternoon and evening,
and the public generally is invited to at
tend.
Prominent artists have most gener
ously contributed some of their best
work. Among the contributions already
promised are five water colors by Latl
mer. an oil landscape by Keith, a ImJ
House next week. This work was adapt
ed from the same French sources as
"Paul Jones" and "The Privateer." The
cast will include the reappearance, of
Louise Royce, after two years' success in
the East, as Arabella, the second wife of
Kerbynew; Helen Merrill as the Puritan
maid Lila, Kerbynew's ward; John J.
Raffael and Arthur Donaldson, alternat
ing as the American hero, Paul Morand;
Phil Branson as Mr. Kerbynew, a rich
merchant; Edwin Stevens as the lovable
old tar. Father Bernard; Edith Hall as
his devoted companion. Little Pete, the
cabin boy; Frank McGlynn as the Gover
nor of New Province: Macfarlane, and
Arthur Boyce as Captain Thompson. New
scenery, costumes and effects have been
prepared and a superb chorus and aug
mented orchestra will lend efficient aid.
A new finale for the third act. entitled
"A Toast to the American Flag:," written
by John P. "Wilson, music composed by
Max Hirschfeld. has been added to the
score. A complete production of a new
burlesque upon "AH Baba" will follow.
Jhe OrpKeum.
The Orpheum announces three new acts
and several changes by the favorites of
last week. Among the new people are
K-uie Rooney, who is known as one of the
lest in her line of work in the country.
She will appear in songs, dances and im
personations, including an imitation of
her father, the late Pat Rooney, who in
in oil by Raschen. a landscape by Yon
Perbandt, a study by Arthur Mathews, a
water color by Jorgensen, "Portola's Dis
covery of San Francisco Bay" by E. M.
Pissis, two landscapes by Cadenasso, a
landscape by Bloomer, a picture by
Breuer, a bust of Joaquin Miller by lie
Jeune. an oil study by Stanton and a
Chinatown water color by Nappenbach.
The music for the exhibition promises
to be one of the pleasantest features.
The Press Club will furnish the refresh
ments, the proceeds of which will be
added to the fund to be distributed by
the committee In charge, which is com
Â§osed of the following ladles: Mrs. A.
cott, Miss Caro Cook, Miss N. Clark and
Miss Annabel Lee.
â 
his day was the idol of lovers of Celtic
comedy. Wills and Loretto will appear
! in a comedy skit; Mr. Wills in his favorite
character, that of a tramp, while the part
of the gay c.hanteuse tits Mile. Loretto
to perfection. They have a clever sketch
replete with ludicrous situations and
laughable dialogue. Mile. Loretto intro

and Bartram claim the world's cham
j pionship when it comes to club swinging.
I They were here two years ago and made
I a great success, and they have a more
â  sensational act now than when here be
fore. Ezra Kendall promises an entirely
! new line of comedy. As a humorist ha
! excels. This week he will talk on a num
i ber of local subjects. Retained from last
: week's bill are Al Leach and the Three
j Rosebuds, who begin the last week of
: their engagement. Harry Allister in his

his troupe of trained cats and dogs. Mat
inees Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday.
J^crosco's Qrarvd Opzra Housz
"The Cotton King" is next week's play
at Morosco's. George P. Webster, who
starred at this house last week, will play
Shillinglaw, while the leading role will bo
given to another newcomer, H. Percy
; Meldon. who will direct future produc
1 tions at the big opera house, besides play
j ing in the stock. Meldon has an excellent
Eastern reputation, a good stage appear
ance, and possesses a magnetic personal
ity that will soon make him a favorite
with the audiences. The plot of the play
is an interesting one. replete with strik
ing and exciting incidents/ the comedy
element is clever and amusing, and the
scenic features of the order that calls for
the ingenuity of the mechanical ffrce. A
strong scene shows the machinery .and
busy operatives of the huge cotton mills
in action. When the noon hour arrives
the whirring and busy looms stop. Other
scenes are replete with interest, as those
who saw the production at the Columbia
will doubtless remember.
The y\lcazar.
The second and last week of "The Mas
ter of Ceremonies' begins to-morrow
evening at the Alcazar. Lewis Morrison
plays the role of Stuart Dansville. and
Miss Florence Roberts is a pretty and
talented second. The stage picture in
the third act in the palace of Lord Car
voro is the handsomest setting so far
presented at the Alcazar. After "The
Master of Ceremonies" "A Celebrated
Case" will be revived. The piece is most
familiar to the majority of the theater
people of the country. The circumstances
which develop the plot and make up the
very interesting story are drawn from
scenes and incidents surrounding the lives
j of the soldiers of the "King's Own Army"
and their families. Mr. Morrison created
the role of the Count de Mornay when "A
Celebrated Case" first became popular.
The Ghutes.
At the Chutes they have what might
sincerely be described as a "monster at
traction" this week. Henri Maurice Can
non, the "Greatest Gun on Earth," as
the press agent calls him, will make his
first appearance this afternoon. Mr.
Cannon is a native of Zurich, 48 years of
age, 5 feet IQV2 inches in height, and un
assumingly carries around 613 pounds of
excess baggage in the form of fat. He is
the largest man who ever came to Ameri
j ca, and has just created a great sensa
i tion in New York. This is the second city
j in America that he has crowded his way
I into.
In the theater, besides some of last
I week's performers, Bovino and Marzella,
acrobats and contortionists, will make
their first appearance in San Francisco.
Uno, a sleight-of-hand performer, is also
a new attraction. The animatoscope
shows a number of camp scenes at Bay
District track.
Jhe Olxjmpia.
The blograph, with its thrilling war
scenes, is still the feature of the Olym
pia Music Hall, and with the new scenes
each week it would appear as though
this attraction might be kept on indefi

EASTERN MARKETS.
' NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.. ;
NEW YORK. Juno 4. â There was -no trace,
left to-day of the reactionary tendency mani- J
fest In the stock market late yesterday. The \
change might be accounted for ..in two ways.,
First, the adoption by the Senate oi the sec- ,
tion of the revenue bill authorizing an Issue
of bonds and treasury^ certificates. .Second, the
professional speculators, who sold' stocks and i
took their profits early in the week and were â 
anxious to get back fit low prices.
The second explanation Is more likely to be
true. It whs evident before the opening of: the j
market to-day tliat' It would be N difflcuit to j
effect any further decline In prices, London
had advanced Americans a large fraction all â¢
aro.und. London made much of the action- of "j
the Senate in adopting the bond -provision, ;
and was also Influenced . by' the j persistent :
rumors from Paris, and even from Madrid, that
Spain was eeukinx a way to pea'oo. Puns
bought Spanish â¢).Â« heavily on tins rumor. and
effected a sharp advance .In the price. . it is .
probable that the buying: of Americans -in Lon- j
don was In jtnrt on cabled orders from. New
York by purchasers too eager to wait 'for the
Opening here. No account was taken of the
reported slnklnjr of an American collier. in the
mouth of Santiago harbor, a.s li was accepted
as a rr.rÂ«r;iir" for blockading the harbor. .
The rumor of the destruction of the Spanish '
fleet had â â  more ; effect, and. prices advanced I
buoyantly all tin- '!â ;;â ! the list. When the bonk I
statement first appeared there was some pres- :
pure to Sell by traders, .who make It, a rr:- 1 to
always sell stocks when the banks',- surplus
reserves show a decrease; But a better '
analysis of the return soon led to renewed buy- !
ing. The lire of money reflected in the loan |
expansion is a healthful feature of the bttsi- '
ness outlook. The closing was active and |
strong at r.enr top prices, net pains In the case
of most active stocks ranging between 1 and 2 '
points and In exceptional oases above that. â ..".
Attention Is attracted by the Government's
Ftatomenf of .the amount of money in circula
tion In : the country en | June I, | which ' is strrt>;d
at' n.S39.S3S.2.'C exclusive of the holdings of the.
United States treasury. This 'ls a â¢ circulation i
per capita of $14 73.
The Increnpe In tjie circulation in May alone
Trpst33.lS6.Sl4. of which $32,333,871 was of gold.
Trr the year the circulating medium was ex- j
panded $1Â£0,1E4,3C1, and of this $123,349,95S 1b of |
Fold. The country's net gold Imports of nearly
$100,000,000 In liquidation of the trade balanct
j appears |in the circulation. Hut that thin
i amount of net imports of gold comes anywhere
near effecting a final settlement of the trade
balance of the year is not conceivable. ThÂ«
â  trade balance for the fiscal year In our favoi
will certainly approach near $000,000,000," com
pared with the greatest previous favorable bal
ance of less than $300,000,000.
Bonds have distinctly shown the broadening
pressure of idle money seeking employment in
enlarged business and higher prices. United

FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK, June The Financier says:
The New York banks, contrary to all expec
tations, seem to have found use for all the
money they have received from Various sources
last week. It had b?en confidently predicted
that the statement for the seven days ending
June 4 would show a large gain in surplus re
serve, but the actual facts, as revealed by the
Clearing-house totals, are that while cash in
creased $1,898,400. the expansion- in, deposits of
$13,413,200 swelled the -.reserve requirements
over $3,350,000. bringing about a decrease in
surplus holdings of $1.404. Naturally, such a
result tends to place the money market on a
firmer basis, although excess cash amounting
to more than 151.000,000 is In bank vaults here,
and there Is little likelihood that rates will
attain a higher level. The heavy Increase of
$11,850,900 in loans is an encouraging feature.
The banks are rapidly regaining the high point
attained In deposits previous to the opening of
March. Since April 30 they have added 131,
Â£.00,000 to their loans, while deposits are nearly
$31,000,000 larger. The loan total for the current
week, however. Is $40,000,000 lower than that
reported on February 25, and deposits are
smaller by $20,000,000 than on the same date.
The loan decrease represents In large : part
sterling bills sold to expedite gold Imports,
while the material difference In the decrease In
deposits, as compared with loans Is evidence
of gold received and still held. It also shows
,ln a measure the extent of the return to the. In
terior movement and heavy disbursements by
the Government since the beginning of the
war. â¢
-LONDON MARKET. '
NEW YORK, June 4.â The Evening Post's
London financial cablteram rays: The â¢ stock
markets here were quiet to-day. The tone was
steady, but consols and India issues were a
shade lower. It is said that consols have been
sold by holders in order to release funds for
the purchase of the new Greek loan recently
Issued and which Is being sold In London with
about a quarter per cent premium. There are
rumors that a large Indian loan is Imminent,
but thÂ» -rumors are probably premature. â  India
was quite a large buyer of Americans. Ameri
cans were steady and quiet and mostly, above
the New York parity. > Spanish bonds . were
strong. â¢ The London. market Is 1%.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, June 4.â The sunshine and warmth
that was quickening the growth in the fields
withered prices in the wheat pit to-day. July
closed with a loss of l%c and September l%c.
Corn left off Vie and it .was %@%e. lower. .._.*
j Pork, lard and ribs show a decline of 10Â®
i 12c and s<g" l . respectively. ..'â  : â  '
i The predominating factor in wheat at the
start was the weather, 1 and ; that"" was : favor
able fur the early maturing of the crop. Liver
pool was 2!4d: higher, for July and %*l. up for
| September. Beerbohm cabled . that the -. weather
| in France was bad. Those latter items of in
j formation received no consideration from local
I speculators. The sunshine and clear sky that
I could be seen from the Board of Trade win
: dows had too potent an . eliect to lVmlt of
| other inlluenceH at . that time. There were
I bug stories from Kansas of a most harrowing
I description and reports from Buda Pest of rust
| In -the wheat crop of Hungary. ' Kven that
â¢ could not overcome the beanahneHS that * had
!so suddenly seized the crowd. In about forty
' minutes after the opening' September, whlcn
closed yesteraay at MHMNv%C had sold' down
to 7i>Vi'fl<S?*c. There was a rather .- nervous,
feeling in July, however. ' Shorts . were dis
posed to cover and there was some demand
tor the lon* uecount. The crowd, : however,
which had bought 100 freely on the bull sen
i timent yesterday, got discouraged at the tame
ness and weakness displayed. As the close
drew near, they attempted t.i liquidate, and the
strength which " had ruled In ' July early : was
all lest. Near the close "the bearish- feeling
gathered In intensity in September and that
month suffered a still further decline. Chi
cago receipts were 35 cars, 7 of them con
tract, and 70,000 bushels were inspected out
of store. Minneapolis and Duluth received. 164
cars, against 340 a year ago. The seaboard
clearances of wheat and Hour for the â  day
were equal to 326,000 bushels. July opened ' %c
lower at 93V4<Â§94c, ' sold up â¢to 94W.C, down to
93^>c, up to 94 % c, fell off to 92c and. firmed up
to 92 1 at the close. September began %@' T/scT /sc

to 79% c. declined to 7S lie ' and rose to-.75%@
1 fS-Tie, the closing figure. - -.'â¢
An easier feeling was displayed in corn on
lower cables, large receipts and favorable
weather for the . growing crop. Export â  de
mand has disappeared. July opened Vie lower
at 33Â®33%, sold down steadily to 32% c, then
steadied to 32%Â®32?4c at the close. -
There was some changing from July to Sep
tember oats. July started V4c off at 24'4c and
sold up to 24(&24'*c. the resting figure.-
The firmness in .provisions at the start was
based on the small receipts of hogs and â an
advance of s(sloc In prices at .the yards. Sell
ing by packers turned prices downward. July
pork started 5c , hither . at' lie, sold: up to
$11 05. then dropped steadily to $10 67's at the
close.
July lard opened unchanged at $6 17M- and

j VERDI'S PERMANENT ABODE.
That Verdi, the veteran composer, has
definitely decided to forego a residence
in Paris and to pass the remainder of
his days in Milan, has just been con
firmed in an interview with him pub
lished in II Secolo of Milan. A few
weeks ago It was stated on what seem
ed to be good authority that he intend
ed to make his future home in Paris.
But his niece and his Milanese friends
dissuaded him from the idea, reminding
him of his great age, his poor health
and the sorrow that the inhabitants of
Sanf Agata, where he has lived until
now, would feel at his departure, with
no hope of ever seeing the maestro
again. He had wished, when his wife
died, to have her body repose in the
park of his estate at Sanf Agata; but
on this point he has changed his mind,
and he has caused her to be entombed
in the chapel of the Home for Veteran
Musicians which he founded a few
years ago in a suburb of Milan. This
was the principal reason why Verdi
finally decided to spend his declining
days in Milan.

FREEING THE BEAR
SHO'.' 1 said the Lob Lolly, "it will
come out all right."
"I dunno," answered Sinbad.
doubtingly, "I awfully skeered of
bears."
"Think of the gramr'^PS and sharks
and dolphins and whales an' ail the
rest of the . in f he sea and they are
free. Oh! that's poetry, all by luck."
"I've lived 2000 years in Bagdad and
I have never he. rd of anything like
that." 1
"O'i,- come on."
So we all went to the Golden Gate
Park, Katy and Char'ie, Sinbad and
the Lob Lolly, and I brought up the
rear, and in forty minutes we were at
the cage in which the grizz ..- bear is
a prisoner.
"After we cet him out he'll be all
right," explaired the Lob Lolly. "He
will go out of the park with us so quiet
like that no one will notice him. Then
we will let him loose and he will find
his way back to his old home in the
hills and be through with his illsâ
that's another poem."
â¢Where did you learn poetry?" asked
Katy admiringly.
Charlie grinned.
"I've, been reading the war poems,
fifty a day, and all pretty bad, ever
since Dewey took Manila."
It was just as the Lob Lolly had
said.- We took the grizzly out of his
cage; the Lob Lolly cutting off the iron
bars wr a chisel, ad the bear looked
happyâ the first time in years. He
walked alons: with us through the Park
on Ms hind legs, lo.'-'np- f OI - a u the
world like the Great-Big-Bear in the
Goldilocks story. As â â¢â¢â¢ took a side
path, the policemen did not see us.
Katy "and Charlie both said that they
thought this was stealing a bear, but
the- Lob Lolly argu-d with them that
tie can really own a bear more than

' both curious to see what would happen

it when we reached the starting
. ' â  pi&cÂ£ ol the Haight-street cable cars
there" \vas a sensation. No policeman
.h-appened to be there, but there were
m.any Car men and a raft of women and
dfen standing about.
"{'We'd better get on a car." Sinbad
: â¢.pn&posed. That was all right, but the
gJMfczly would not go. He anchored him
.s*=-!f near a popcorn stand and would
..not budge one inch, evidently meaning
. tn stay there until he could eat up all
the popcorn, peanuts, candies, bananas
and oranges in sight. One of his first
acts was to step upon the peanut
roaster with one big foot, thereby
â¢ breaking it open. He ate all the pea
nuts and opened his mouth for more.
The Lob Lolly was a master of
strategy. He lugged the whole stand
of goodies, with the help of Sinbad, to
one of the cars and threw it inside.
Then the bear ambled in and began to
gorge himself.
"Where is the car conductor?" de
WILD AND DARING CHARGE OF THE BUMPKIN CAVALRY, WHO ARE NOW PRACTICING FOR THE FIELD OF BATTLE.
manded the Lob Lolly. "It is time to
go."
The car conductor and every one else
in the neighborhood had run away.
Most of these persons were willing to
watch proceedings from the windows
of upper stories in the near-by build
ings. - â¢â  ; 7 1 ; ' â¢
"Let's you'n me run the car, Sinbad."
"AH right let's, but let me say that I
have lived 2000 years in Bagdad and I
have never seen anything like this."
Katy and Charlie and 1 were on the
front seats of the dummy. Sinbad told
us all to get- off and push and so we
did. My, but it was hard work getting
the car up the hill from the turntable,
but when we were on top of the grade
it was all that we could do to get on
the car. before it could run away from
us.
By this time the grizzly had finished
eating and was satisfied to go into the
place usually occupied by the cable .
gripman. What an intelligent bear.
He seized the bell cord over head and
rang like a good fellow.
"Clang, clang, clang! Get out of the
way," said the bell, as plainly as ever
bell has said anything since there were
bears or bells.
An old lady at the corner waved an
umbrella at us and shrieked out that
she would report us to the superintend
ent because we failed to stop.
A fat man tried to get upon the plat
form as we flew past, slipped, turned
a complete somersault in the air, and
landed squarely on top of his bald head
and he kicked so that he seemed to
have as many legs as an ofctopus has
arms.
A dog tried to cross the tracks in
front of us and his tail was amputated
as cleverly as it could have been done
by an expert.
Going down the grade toward Market
street we got up such speed that the
telegraph poles looked to be as near
together as toothpicks in a bunch. We
whizzed around the Market street
curve.
Just then Sinbad and the Lob Lolly
both came to the front of the car and
looked a little anxious. They were sail
ors, indeed, and even the Jarring of the
car and its wild swaying to and fro
were not enough to make them walk
unsteadily. Not so with the griz
zly.
All the whoops of all the Indians
since Columbus discovered America, If
rolled into one, would have been less
striking than the growls and whines of
the bear. He was scared and crawled
over upon the dummy seat, edged his
way along between Katy and Charlie
and sat there, snugly, with his two
arms around the two children, smiling
in the funniest bear way possible.
"We've got to throw out a drag or
go to Davy Jones' locker this time,
sure," said the Lob-Lolly, with a little
chuckle.
"Drag it Is," said Sinbad.
There was a crash at the hack end of
the car. The two sailors had broken
off the back dasher and were fasten
ing it to the bell cord, which they had
pulled down.
The bear was every minute squeez
ing the children harder and harder and
something cracked.
"What is that, Katy?" I asked. "One
of your ribs?"
"Worse than that. My long stick
of striped red and white candy is
broken."
"Heave," commanded the Lob Lolly.
"Heave it is," responded Sinbad, and
they together threw overboard the
dasher.
We stopped just before we reached
the ferry. All the ferry-boats were
out, all except a little one, with a
walking beam. that runs over to
Berkeley. We all hurried onto that
and pushed off. The bear took hold
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JUNE 5, 1898.
of one side of the walking beam and
the Lob Lolly and Sinbad were on the
other side. Katy and Charlie and I
steered all together.
It was fun to see the walking beam
carry the bear in the air; and then
carry the Lob Lolly and Sinbad. The
bear worked as if he thought the whole
performance some sort of a game. We
laughed and laughed and cheered, and
the bear growled as the boat steadily
forged ahead.
When we reached the Berkeley shore
we all sat on the wharf until we were
rested and there we feasted on the
pieces of Katy's stick of striped candy,
the bear enjoying it more than any of
us. If you are asked where the bear
has gone do not tell, for this is all a
secret. He is off in the mountains
somewhere. D. H. W.
ROUN' IN THE WAY.
BY ELLA M. SEXTON.
Yes. it's hard to be a little boy,
(That's what I've always found).
Big follers have dead loads o' fun
An' make us stan' around
Or chase the ballâ but when it comes
Our "licks" they up an' say.
"Clear out. you little Kids, we don't
Want you ruun' in the way."
.f^TR^TeGY.
An" the big boys think it's jest our fault
We did't come to town
When they didâ an' they call us names
An' tease us up an' down!
They're always got such secrets,
An' keep goin' off to play
Where we can't go alongâ they don't
Want us roun' in the way!
An' brothers ie the worst of all!
They're always 'fraid you'll touch
Any ol' thing o' theirsâ as if
They'd got so dreftul much!
So they lock their drawers an' hide the
rest
An' then they growl an' say,
"Mommf-r, here's that kid, I don't
Want him roun' in the way."
So I jest wish I was Xumber One
(Instead 'o Number Three),
I'd give the little boys a chance
To live then, don't you see?
Mommer says, "Don't mind, you'll be
A big boy too, some day,"
But they make me tired jest saying they
don't
Want me roun' in the way!

PATRIOTIC little Douglas W.
Dodge is 9 years old only. He is
a live, wi eawake San Francisco
boy, who lives at 26 Pleasant
street. Into his young head came
an idea that he woui i go forth to
serve hjs country and to honor the
beautiful flag which is a visible sign
of freedom. That he is not on his way
to Manila with the First Regiment of
California Volunteers is due only to an
accident of wliic*. he is not respon
sible.
Little Douglas has a brother who is
an artist well known to thousands of
readers of The Ca' Douglass may
have artistic instincts. Certainly the
great outpouring of . hildren when the
first troops, the arti ry men from the
Presidio, passec uo Van Nessaveniie
and Golden G *fÂ» venue on their way
to the cars, touch 1 a responsive chord
in his breast, ~^ank upon rank, thou
sands and tl ousands of our Can Fran
cisco boys and gir - lined Van Ness and
Gold n Gate avenue as the grim can
non rumbled by, ma ned by Americans
whose gallantry can.ot be called into
question.
Little Douglass carried an American
flag that proud day His shrill little
voice was raised in chorus with thou
sands of other shrill little voices and
his flag kissed the breeze with thou
sands of other flags, while the pleased
artillery- men bowe" and manifested
their pleasure, and he thought that
they bowed to him. Proud, exultant,
hearing still in his ardent i- agination
the dull rumble of the cannon wheels
and the footfalls of the artillery
horses, he awaited with impatience the
march pf the First United States In
fantry.
Once more the sidewalks burgeoned
with myriads upon myriads of Amer
ican flags, upheld by childish patriots,
boy and girls. Looking down upon
them it seemed as if Freedom's flower
garden was there in its full bloom.
Onward came the magnificent First
Infantr;-. swarthy, keen of eye, alert
as greyhounds, sinewy, lordly, every
inch heroes: each^swinging along at a
natural gait. There Were their shel
ter tents, their uniforms, their rifles,
swift to sing a miserere, their flags;
their br..id â and the were real sol
diers who had seen service fi-hting In
dians â real, live, ferocious redskins!
"Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah" shouted
little Douglas, shouting: until he was
hoarse, shouting and waving his flag
until the soldiers were away down the
street and off 1 the war.
"Was there ever a live American boy
who has failed to elieve that Amer
ican soldiers are the best so* "iers on
earth? Not one. Nor was tnere ever
an American boy who d i not firmly
believe that victory must P ways go
with the American â¢-â¢Â». Imagine now
a boy's idea of a battlefield. Guns go
off with a stunning noise; men on
horses hold up long shining swords
and yell "forward" to daring cavalry
men, who sweep forward with the
speed of the wind vith bared sabers
flashing; or lead the men who carry
the guns upon which are fixed sharp
glistning bayonets and who advance
on the run, cheering all the time, un
der the folds of the Star Spangled
Banner. Hither and yon are brave
drummer boys beating lustily on their
drum head., while fifes shrill and
bugles sound the loud ala urn of war.
The foe flees. Victory, victory, oh
victory! for the beautiful red. white
and blue. The red, white and blue for
ever!
Nor was there evf-r a curly headed
little dreamer of a boy who has not
pictured how ne it would be to sail
over summer seas by day and by night,
listening to the wav foaming as they
are parted by the cieaving. sharp
bow of the tr"sty ship. Then, too,
think the -reamers, there are coral
islands in the Pacific, each inclosing a
silvery lagoon, each surrounded by a
ring of white, hoarse breakers, the
foam from which rises like smoke and
blows far inland, to be lew slender
palm trees and pineapple trees and be
salt the faces of fie i3land men and
;Â£?C>UARtLY 9? 'TOP Of r
women, who live in grass huts and
carry about awful va clubs, but who
would scamper away at the sight of
real soldiers! Sinbad, Robinson
Crusoe, shipwrecks, sharks, how de
lightful!
When little Douglas Dodge talked
to a friendly grocery manâ for all the
world just as little Lord Fay .tleroy
used to talk to his grocery man â he
found a stimulus for his imagination
and into his head c; ie the idea which
grew into fixed determination that he
would go to war ar.d fight for the
United States and t_ a real nine-year
old soldier. He tha there was a
lady who wanted him to go to Cuba
with her and he tin ught it would be
well to have her with him, but this
lady was a fiction, invented by some
one who- did not know the child.
Very well, then; He could not go to
Cuba â he would go to Manila with the
First California Volunteers. H^ kept
his secret. The day came when the
Californians made their ever famous
march from the cam- ground to the
Pacific Mail rock. Douglas looked at
th- with beating heart and eager
eyes. He heard the band, saw the
marching, and thought i' all simply
glorious. He had s^^retly planned to
stow himsel away on the 1 king and
go with the Californians. Tie \vn? nnt
able to get upon the ship. But his
purpose was indomi* ble.
Another march took place and the
First Oregon Regiment caused huzzas
to smite the sk - â¢ Jiey gallantly pro
ceeded to embark v >on the Australia
and the City of S"dnev for the far off
Philippines, to t. the assistance of
the brave Admiral T - - Â°y. The troops
marcho. tin the gang nlanks and were
aboard. Cowering in the hnlf dusk of
the"between decks" of the Rydn v. i-i
among the bunks erected for 'he use
of thi soldiers boys, was the form of a
boy â a very little boy. No one noticed
him f or a lone ti .c. He trembled but
felt happy. He was a stowaway and
he was little Douglas Dod*â¢. How he
came there - cannot pretend to ex
plain.
The great steamer swung idly at the
dock while -tores we-e going on board.
Crowds watch- ' and admired the sol

"As he stood on the Port Tampa dock
in line with his larger and older com
rades, his little black eyes sparkled
with pride and excitement. He had
his haversack on just as the big sol
diers had, and he was able to carry
. the Springfield rifle that he held at
his side. | Sturdy and strong in ' cour
age, he waited patiently until the com
pany to which he belonged got orders
to march on the boat. Not a moment
did he waver when the order came, but
â¢with military mien he shouldered his
gun and swung with the line as it
mounted the gangplank.

many glances and looks of admiration,
and he felt proud of the attention ,he
attracted. - I, with several other news
paper correspondents, edged my "way
through the crowd that surroundÂ«;l him
while he was on the deck. The i.id
talks Spanish fluently, of course, and
can get along fairly well with English.

"But aren't you afraid you will be
killed?"
"No, sir." .". r. .*â ; : ./:
"But you cannot hold that gun up to
shoot."
"No, but I can lay it on something and
pull the trigger. Yes, it might kick,
but -if it does I don't care. . When I
get over there I will get a little gun,
such as the men on horses carry. I
can shoot that standing up." :

THE VOICES.
BY MARGARET VAN CLEVE,
SACRAMENTO.
The sun was shining bright and clear.
And pleasant voices sounded near;
Hard by the little cottage wall
Towered a willow, graceful, tall.
Once I sat by the clear brook's side
And listened "to the murmuring tide;
I heard sweet voices loud and clear,
Full of glad life and merry cheer.
And once again, when all was still,
I heard those voices on the hill;
But shall I hear those voices more?
Far, far is childhood's happy shore.
Nellie, aged three, was out walking:
with her father one evening, but she
soon becamÂ« tired and he was obliged
to carry her. "Is I vewy heavy, papa?"
she asked, as he set her down a mo
ment to rest. "Indeed, you are," he re
plied. "Ray, papa," (.ontinued the little
miss, "isn't you dest awful tickled at
I ain't twins?"
LITTLE GOLD SEEKERS.
BY MAGGIE R. KOTTINGER,
SAN JOSE.
Let's play be miners, sister,
And go and search for gold.
Away ut) north in Klondike,
Where all is white and cold.
We must sail the big blue ocean.
In a steamer called the "Brave;"
And then we'll have a ship-wreck
But all the lives we'll save.
I'll he the captain, sister,
And you the first mate true;
And this field of wild nag-lilies
Will be the waters blue.
Over yonder, where those clovers '
That little knoll have hidden,
Will be a dang'rous Island
On whose rocky shores we've ridden.
After days and days of sailing
We'll reach Alaska's land.
And we'll leave our storm-tossed vessel
On Alaska's shore to stand.
This patch of white forget-me-nots
Will be great fields of snow,
Where slowly, with our sled and dogs,
Over narrow trails we'll go.
At list we'll reach the river,
Near where the gold is found;
And, when we go to mining,
Snowless will oe the ground.
Then see. here are the gold fields!
These yellow poppies bright!
When the snow was on the ground
This gold was out of sight.
Now we'll pick golden nuggets,
All that our arms can curry.
And travel home with treasure
For mama and boy Harry.
NELLIE'S IDEAS
ABOUT THE WAR.
ISAW the girls march on Memorial
day in San Francisco. They kept
time to the muÃic of the band and
looked cute. My sister May says
she would be afraid to march that way
for fear a horse would step on her, but
she is a little thing, and that Is why
she scares so. But she Las a dolL she
calls Columbia, and it wears a red,
white and blue dress that mamma
made for it.
May says it would be the most fun to
be a general and ride on a horse. Are
all the men who were on the horses
generals? I saw one whole company
of men who were riding and they all
had sharp swords. Were they all gen
erals? I thought soldiers were always
firing guns, but I must be mistaken,
because mamma says they have to stop
to eat ar.d of course they don't flre
guns when they are asleep, because
they might wake themselves up if they
did, and then they would be tired all
the time.
I am 12 years old. I read all about
the war in the papers, but don't under
stand much what is happening. But
I'll tell you what I'd do: If the Span
ish are really bottled up, as the news
papers say they are. I'd open up the
bottles nnd give them some fresh air,
for it must be dreadful to live in bot
tles where the weather is as hot as it
is in Cuba. But how did the Spaniards
get into the bottles? They must be big
bottles.
I wish you would tell me whether
the soldiers really eat hardtack that is
so hard they have to break it up with
AND "THE BEAR LOWED '
. . /Happy' I
a pickax, as the Bumpkins in Camp
Hardtack do? Perhaps it is soft when
they soak it. If it isn't it would make
good bullets. My papa used to be a
soldier, and what I ask him makes him
laugh. Now, are my questions funny,
or what Is the matter? He told me to
write and ask, and so* I have.
NELLIE HARGOOD.
Little Mabel was visiting in the coun
try and saw some little pigs for the
first time. What attracted her atten
tion most was the twist in their tails,
and after looking at them in wonder
for quite a while she asked: "Say,
grandpa, does the piggies' mamma put
their tails up in curl papers every
night?"
LITTLE SOLDIER
AND THE GEESE
I've got a brar.d new uniform,
I've got a flag and drum;
I'm looking up and down the road
For Spaniard men to come.
I've got a sword and pistol, too;
I've got a horse to ride;
And when those Spaniard men see mÂ«
I bet they'll run and hide.
But I will chase and capture them
Wherever they may go.
And I will bravely march them home,
All marching in "a row.
And I'll take every sword they've got,
And I'll take every gun.
And after that I'll send them home.
And then the war'll be done.
Hello! What's that? I hear a noise
And see a dreadful sight-
About a thousand Spaniard men.
In uniforms of white!
Oh. dear! they're coming right this way,
I don't know what to do!
I'm going right straight home to ma!
Oh, dear! Oh! Oh! 800-hoo!

SPIRIT OF THE YOUTH.
THERE Is a company of small boys
Who parade near the water front
in this city whenever they get a
chance, out of school. They c*rry
wooden guns and have something
around them like cartridge belts. Half
a dozen drummers furnish the music
for them to march by. Crowds near
the foot of Market street, who are wait
ing for incoming regiments to march
out to Camp Richmond, are frequent
ly aroused by these boys, who "rally
round the flag" with spirit. Phil
Clancey is the captain and Martin Nu
nan is the standard bearer.
When the Civil War between tha
North and the South was in progress
there were thousands of boy soldier
companies in the United States. Some
of the uniforms were very pretty.
There were suits such as the old Con
tinental troops, the soldiers of the Rev
olutionary War, were dressed in â three
cornered hats, knee breeches, etc. Then
there were Zouaves, with blue jackets,
red, baggy trousers and turban-like
caps. Small boys reveled in joint pro
cession of brass cannons, which made
considerable noise. Boy soldier com
panies may once more become as pop
ular as they were in the early sixties.

MR. NORTH
NEGLECTS
HIS DUTY
A Demand to Remove
Him From Office.
INCOMPETENCY IS CHARGED.
PASSENGERS DISCOMMODED BY
HIS ABSENCE.
Commissioner of Immigration Using
the Office as a Side Show-
Annex to H's Law
Practice.
â¢ .Custom-house circle? were agog yester- !
â¢&'si.y over a rumor that serious charges |
â¢w'ere.tP be preferred against United States ;
â â¢Commissioner of Immigration Hart H. !
..S'orfh. Assemblyman from Alameda
Co.unty. â¢
.. It Is alleged that the Commissioner is
. Incompetent and also neglectful of his j
-'official duties, to the great inconvenience |
of masters of vessels and their passen
â  gers arriving from foreign ports. Much ;
. complaint against his office has been j
made ever since he took possession of it,
but patience has been worn out and dras- ,
tic measures have been inaugurated to
have him removed from office and to sup
ply the vacancy with some one who will :
attend to the duties of Immigration Com
Â° missioner.
Mr. North is an Assemblyman from |
Alameda County, with a law office in the
â Mills building in this city and a residence [
in u Oakland. Ever since his appointment
to the lucrative Federal position he has
gone on practicing his profession as a )
lawyer, spending the greater part of his
time in his office in the Mills building and
la his | residence across the bay. The |
office of the Commissioner of Immigration
Is on 'he third floor of the Appraisers'
building, and when business is dull in the
courts and there is not much doing in the
law office in the Mills building Mr. North
occasionally visits his Federal officeâper
haps to â "see that none of his deputies have '
died since he saw them last.
He had not been long in office before he
succeeded in procuring the appointment
of additional help in the person of A. de I
la Torre as deputy and interpreter of
Spanish, notwltnstanding the fact that
the present deputiesâ Schell and j
Geffeney-^-are faithful men and had per- |
formed "ttrefr duties under the administra
tion of Commissioner Stradley to the sat
isfaction of ail parties concerned. But as
Messrs. Schell and Geffeney are often
on the water front attending to the duties
. of "their office and as Mr. North's law
business -r6iuir.es hiÃ attendance at his
office In the 'Mills building 'or in the |
'â¢ courts it was -necessary to Increase ex- i
- penses by hiring Mr. de la Torre to re
; main in the -office during the few hours
' of the day ah which it. is. kept open.
But' Mr. de -la 'Torre was not enough.
Within the- past 'few weeks a lady type
writer has- b^eh" added to the force, al
though the*" business' has not been any
;; heavier' than i.t was during the Stradley
.administration. W,hen Mr.. Stradley did
office duty" and 'when the -two deputies
took care of the. outside matters. An- I
other Innovation was the shortening of
the office hours : when Mr. North signed
the following â¢ circular, which has been
pastea on the door of the Immigration
.office? Ââ¢â¢ - .
NOTICE!
Tflffl 'OFFICE CIgSBS AT 3 P. M.
. . c _ DAILY.
SATURDAYS, .12 O'CLOCK NOON.
H. H. NORTH. Commissioner.
' : Under' "the .administration of his prede
cessor the ' office remained open until 4
p. â¢ns.y'a-n'd 'as already stated there was j
.no complaint:
â¢:. Tl)e. -complaints referred to are from
ma^te'ns of vessels which have the mis- j
fortune- .to arrive with passengers from '
forefgh- ports at other than the office
â¢hours : of. the Commissioner of Immigra- j
tion-/ '.In such cases It is not practicable j
' for the masters to send special Commls- ,
' eioners bver to Oakland to dig up the
official In order that the passengers may j
be allowed "to land, after they have been
passed upon by the quarantine officer and i
the custom house officials. In fact there
would Be no loss if the office were to be
abolished rather than to be mismanaged
bo grossly as it lias been under the so- I
called administration of Lawyer North.
The latest complaint is made by Cap
tain L. H. Hubbard of the American
brigantine S. X. Castle. The vessel ar
rived from Honolulu last Sunday night.
May 29,Â« at 10 o'clock. She was boarded
.by the quarantine and custom officials, I
who declared the ship and the six passen- j
gers free from disease and entitled to !
free pratique and the privilege of dock- j
ing and landing. But the Commissioner
of Immigration was represented neither
Â° in person nor by deputy. The law re- I
quires that upon the arrival of a vessel
from .a foreign port and carrying passen- â .
gers, ' the â  passengers shall bo examined
by" th.c Commissioner of Immigration and I
Immediately allowed to land if there be
â¢ rip lawful objection.
'The passengers on board the Castle were \
.American citizens, all returning from a
'trip to Honolulu. They were A. H. Me- :
" Cherney,' Charles Rhodes, S. M. Cork*?, i
Me'arle Rhodes, Mrs. M. B. Rhodes and i
â¢ Dr. C. M. Pease, all of them reputable
and well-to-do citizens. Dr. Pease is from i
Los Angeles and had taken a sea voyage !
for the benefit of his health.
â¢ They naturally chafed under the delay, j
and Captain Hubbard, who spares no
pains to make his passengers comfortable,
â¢ lost no time in endeavoring to secure the '
attendance of Commissioner North or one I
â¢of his deputies. At 9 o'clock on the fol
lowing morning, which was Memorial
Day, he dispatched his mate to the office
of the Commissioner. Being a holiday
the office was closed. He could not be \
found in the Mills building, he could not
.be discovered anywhere In San Fran- I
cisco.
The mate, In the course of his weary I
wanderings, visited the Custom-house i
where he found Deputy Surveyor St.
John, who telephoned for the Commis
sioner to all points of the compass, In
cluding the boxing thereof. - But the Com
missioner could not be located. The mate !
returned to the ship and made his re
port. He was sent downtown again and
again, all to no purpose. The captain, re- '
gardful of the rights of his passengers, i
â¢allowed them to land about noon of that
day.
Mr. North's office was opened for busi- ',
ness on Tuesday by his three deputies, '
and when he learned that Captain Hub
bard had neglected to keep his passen
gers prisoners for more than thirty-six
hours to suit the leisure of â¢ tne Commis- ,
sioner he was indignant and caused to be
transmitted to the captain a typewritten !
demand for six thousand dollars penalty :
â¢for- discharging passengers without leave. ';
Captain Hubbard has refused to pay the i
six thousand dollars for the purpose of j
gliding the dignity of an absentee Com- ;
missioner, and will contest the matter in '
th.c courts, so that the question may be [
settled as to whether the traveling, public
la to be subject to the whims and caprices j
of a derelict and incompetent Commis- i
sioner.
' Shortly after the appointment of Mr. I
North it was stated in confidence by, some !
of. his friends that he did not Intend to
give up his law practice because of the
duties devolving upon him as a Federal
.appointee, that he would not tie himself
jto the Federal office, but would continue
'his' law practice as usual, and thus draw
.down remuneration from his clients and
'the Government at the same time.
; The Commissioner's office In the Fed
eral-building: was visited yesterday after
.iwÂ«n nt 1:30 o'clock, but . the door ' was
forked and the Saturday noon closing no
tice stared visitors In the face. Twenty
fnlnutes later his partner In the law of
fice in the Mills building informed the
visitor that Mr. North, both Commis
sioner and lawyer, had sonÂ© home for
the day. ..â¢.-â -- ' 'â  â¢ - : -â¢Â«-_â¢ Â«-_
RED CROSS
BADGES ARE
IN DEMAND
Hundreds Anxious to
Wear the Insignia.
THE SOCIETY STILL GROWS
DONATIONS POUR IN FROM ALL
OVER THE STATE.
School Children Send Eggs With
Mottoes to the Soldiers.
Money Still Flow
ing- In.
Total Receipts up to Yester
day $39,000
The rooms of the local Red Cross So
ciety in the Claus Spreckels building
are daily besieged by hundreds of both
sexes who are anxious to wear the in
signia of the famous organization.
Many are disappointed owing to the
slowness of those engaged in manufac
turing the buttons, but are mollified by
the obliging ladies in charge.
When the Idea of looking after the
welfare of the boys in blue was first
broached in The Call some months ago
the ladies and gentlemen who respond
ed by organizing little dreamed of the
magnitude the work of the society
would reach. Starting as It did, with
small meetings and slight interest, the
noble purpose of the organization be
gan to assert itself in the minds of a
generous public and subscriptions be
gan to How in slowly but surely.
When it was seen that the Govern
ment could not cope with the immense
bodies of troops that kept pouring into
the city, the lied Cross Society stepped
Into the breach and filled the position
of benefactors to a nicety. The city
began to respond with praises for its
grand work and faster and faster do
nations began pouring in, In such large
quantities from every quarter that a
new system of organization had to be
established. A State organization was
perfected to louk after the many branch
societies In every town and hamlet In
the State, while the local board louked
after the constant stream of donations
received from all over this city.
A large warehouse was opened at
16 Post street to store the multiplicity
of things received, and ladies unaccus
tomed to work untiringly labored in
the cause of the army from morn till
night. There was no lack of appre
ciation from the men who enlisted in
defense of their country. Blessings
and warm words of praise poured from
their lips in thankfulness to the ladies
who lessened their sufferings.
That Is why every boy and girl, man
and woman feels proud to wear the em
blem of the Red Cross, as It carries
with it the respect of all who have a
spark of patriotism or feeling in them.
Yesterday 113 members were added
to the society, which already numbers
Into the thousands, and more are anx
i ious to add their names to the roll of
: honor, in the hope that they will be
: allowed to wear the sign of the Red
\ Cross.
Major Fitzg-erald, surgeon of the
Thirteenth Minnesota Infantry, ex
presses warm appreciation for the no
! ble work done by the ladies at the
ferry.
Donations of bandages, caps, com
fort bags and other necessary articles
i were received at 16 Post street yester
j day from Oregon, Pleasanton, Sacra.
' mento, Alameda, Vacaville, Gilroy, An
tioch and many other places in this
' State.
Belmont School sends daily twelve
gallons of milk, which is sent to Camp
Merritt and apportioned out to the
different regiments.
The Church of the Advent, nurses of
St, Luke's Hospital and Forum Club
sent generous allotments of bandages,
handkerchiefs and comfort bags.
E. F. Beckwith of Denver sent $25 to
be spent on the boys from Colorado.
Material will be supplied in bulk to
societies resiring to make it up into
useful articles if they call at 16 Post
street.
Mrs. W. T. Ellis of Marysville sent
180 dozen eggs to the boys in blue.- with
her best wishes.
School children of Benicia expressed
j twenty dozen hard-boiled eggs to the
society, on which was written some
sentiment that will surely add relish
! to those eating them. "Shoot a Span
1 iard for me," "Remember the Maine"
and other expressions were inscribed.
Clarence Martin Mann sent a large
| donation of things to the Red Cross So
: Ciety yesterday.
The young ladies studying at the
â  Girls' High School have formed an
auxiliary branch of the Red Cross So-
I ciety and will shortly send a bountiful
â  supply of necessaries to headquarters.
Master Monroe Schwalba of 1408
! O'Farrell street yesterday brought to
! 16 Post street 250 envelopes and three
| reams of paper, which he had bought
with his savings of nickels.
Mrs. L. Hnnn's juvenile dancing class
will give their third annual entertain
ment and ball in aid of the Red Cross
fund on Friday evening, June 17, in
Odd Fellows' Hall. Thirty-five chil
dren, ranging from 2>,Â£ to 15 years of
age, will participate. The entertain
ment will consist of a fairy dance,
stage nnd fancy dancing, recitations,
national songs and dances.
Among the Minnesota volunteers are
some clever ball players, and they are
daily practicing with a view to gain-
Ing their first victory in this city. Their
challenge to the local aggregation has
been snapped up and on Thursday next
the two strong teams will line up at

THE MAYOR
MAKES A
DECLARATION
Turns His Back on
the Workingmen.
IS AN ARISTOCRATIC BOSS
TO IMPROVE HIS POLITICAL
ASSOCIATIONS.
Declares That He Will Have Nothing
More to Do With South
of Market Street
Democrats.
Mayor Phelan has no further use for
the voters who live south of Market
street. He has sq declarded, so it is
said, and to prove the sincerity of his
assertion he has backed up his words
with deeds.
It was during the trying time when
the McNab-Gould-Alford committee
was scouring the city for Democratic
"high joints" to appoint as members
of the Committee of One Hundred that
the Mayor gave voice to the sentiment
that is now causing a considerable
flow of bile among the Democrats in
the most populous half of the city.
"I have do-ne politics south of Mar
kpt street long enough, and now I am
going to do a little work on the other
side, where the atmosphere is purer."
It was in these words that the Mayor
is said to have proclaimed the course of
his future political efforts.
To prove that the Mayor has been as
good as his word, it is only necessary
to glance at the personnel of the Com
mittee of One Hundred, which was ap
pointed by the men who have sworn
allegiance to him. Of the one hundred
members seventy-two live in the north
ern part of the city and only twenty
eight have their residence south of
Market street. By the wish of the
Mayor, the Democratic party of San
Francisco is to be governed by men
who have nothing in common with the
workingmen and small property-own
ers of the city. Even the twenty-eight
committee members who come from the
district on the sunny side of the city's
great thoroughfare are not representa
tive of the community in which they
live. Of the number not more than half
a dozen are known to even a small por
tion of the gTeat mass of the popula
tion. The others are professional men
and capitalists, who are* not in touch

he made so many of them" When Lincoln said this he meant God loved the

Honest Abe knew as well as Hale's do that every dollar has to be carefully spent

the Democrats against whom it was di
rected entered a protest that bids fair
to Interfere seriously with the cut
and-dried plans of the Phelan follow
ers. The leadership of Major Harney
has acquired a sudden popularity, and
the future is big with possibilities. It
is asserted that the Mayor's defection
would have been received with better
grace by the voters who claim they
have been sat upon if it had been an
nounced prior to the charter election.
It is pointed out that the Mayor
stumped the district south of Market
street in the interest of the charter and
posed as the friend and father protec
tor of the very men whom he has now
deserted as being unworthy of his high
er ideals of the political environment
of an aristocratic boss. He told the
workingmen and the small property
owners of the district that their Inter
ests were his, and that in promulgating
the plan of the new charter he had
in mind their welfare, as against the
selfish interests of the aristocrats.
Some of them believed him and cast
their votes in favor of the charter, and
thus aided in securing Its adoption.
The result had scarcely been an
nounced when their erstwhile friend
came out with the announcement that
he had done with the Democrats whose
hands are soiled by daily labor, and
would henceforth confine his political
exertions to the more aristocratic pre
cincts of the Western Addition and Nob
Hill. The first result of this determina
tion is to be seen in the personnel of
the Committee of One Hundred.
Now that the Mayor's position has
become known to the voters who are
considered by him to be outside of the
pale of the political Four Hundred, a
rebellion is in progress. Its propor
tions are such as to cause serious
alarm to the new-born bosses, and It Is
feared that the State Committee will
have to be called upon to undo the work
it has done at the suggestion of McNab
and his colony of professional reform
ers. The Harneyites, who were entire
ly overlooked when the members of the
Committee of One Hundred were being
selected, declare their intention to fight
the new governing body to the bitter
end. They have been already assured
of the support of the men whom the
Mayor has so recently deserted, as well
as all of the . Democrats who believe
that the arbitrary action of the State
Central Committee in assuming the
right to take charge of local political
affairs was uncalled for and undemo
cratic. Besides this, notice is being
served on the high joints who compose
the committee that they need not now
or ever expect to receive the support,
sympathy or votes of the great ma
jority of the Democratic voters of this
city 1f they persist in retaining their
positions on a committee that is ob
noxious to all good citizens and the ex
istence of which Is due to the unwar
ranted assumption of power by a body
that has nothing to do with local party
differences.
What the general effect of these
threats will be Is still but a matter of
conjecture. Such political pot hunters
as Sammy Braunhart, E. P. E. Troy
and Clitus Barbour are already begin
ning to squirm under the lash, and- it
is expected that some of those of their
associates who would not object to
Berving the people some time in the fu
ture under the favorable provisions of
the new charter will hesitate before
continuing to offend the majority of
Democratic voters.

SURPRISES WEF.E MANY
THE GREAT LISSAK BOWLED
OVER BY STAR POINTER.
Result of the Meeting and the
Probable Winners of the
First Round of
To-day.
The warm wave which dashed in un
expectedly on Friday caused a tired
feeling among the hares and dogs that
ran yesterday at Union Coursing Park.
Surprises consequently were many.
| The day's sport opened with the defeat
of Miller's Maid, a 3 to 1 favorite, over
Mollie, and in the course which fol
lowed Monotony came very near de
feating the .10 to 1 favorite, Sylvanus.
â¢Eclipse, although ranked among the
topnotchers, . was handsomely disposed
of by Jester, a dog' that is showing
marked improvement in his running.
Lady/ Campbell, although . played
strongly to win, ran out of form and
was sent to her kennel without a flag
by, Crosspatch.* Sportsman, owing to
his cunning 'style of running, was de
feated by Mercy May. Black Prince,
a confirmed lurcher, was defeated â¢by
Vanity ; Fair. ; Johnnie R ran a good
and strong- race and defeated ; Green
Valley Maid in the finish of a fairly
long course. Port ; Costa, another dog
of cunning ways, lost to Van -Knapp.
Skyball did not run up to form, but he
defeated Mission Boy nevertheless â¢'.'.,
Glenstone came ..." very ' near sending
White Chief home without honors, iÂ»~..
in the run-off of a "no. course" the
Chief won by a small margin.
Arna, a ' new dog from ; Stockton,
proved to be a thoroughbred lurcher,
and it is doubtful whether he will ever
be : heard from \ favorably. Sunollte, J a
young dog from Merced, will need dose
watching. â "': He gave I the : great Theron
a very hard rub : yesterday in a long
course and could not have been beaten
by more \ than two .'points. .. The ; defeat
of ' Llssak Âby Star â  Pointer > brought
sighs from the. talent, who played him
as high as . 8 and 9 ' to 1 to win. The
winner ran a very good race : all
through. < Lissak died away in . the fin
ish and was about to quit when the
course ended. - >';. â¢

AT INGLESIDE.
The Largest Saturday Attend-
ance of the Season.
A banner crowd saw the dog races at
Jngleside yesterday. The attendance was
the greatest for a Saturday that the park
has ever held, which was in a measure
due to the weather, but chiefly to the
splendid card offered in the all-age stake.
In the puppy stake the favorites with
but a single exception did not suffer an
overthrow. The exception was the defeat
of Mayflower by Phoebe, a 2 to 1 shot.
The great surprises came in the all-uge
stake. Sylvia, after two no-goes with
Flrenzl, easily outran the latter in the
third race. Flrenzi started a favorite, but
was backed down. The Lass o' Gowrie,
1 to 5, surprised the talent by winning
from Lady Jane. Another surprise was
the victory of Glen Chloe over Diana,
who sold as the favorite. 6 to 1.
