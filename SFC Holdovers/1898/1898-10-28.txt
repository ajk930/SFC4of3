SeosatioQal H earjn 9 of tfye Appeal
in the F r^O c h Court of
Cassation.
It Is Said That the Prisoner of Devil's Island
Will Be Released Without Reopening
the Arn)y Scandal.
Special Dispatch to Tbe Call.
LONDON, Oct. 27.â According to the Na
tional Review Emperor. Nicholas of Russia
has become an advocate of Dreyfus re
vision.
PARIS, Oct. 27.â The Court of Cassa
tion which is to decide upon the re
opening of the case of Alfred Dreyfus,
the prisoner of Devil's Island, who is
alleged to have been falsely convicted
of selling important military plans to
agents of a foreign power, opened at
noon to-day. The hall was filled with
people, but there was no demonstration
around the Palace of Justice, the gates
of which were closed. As a matter of
precaution only ticket holders were ad
mitted, and guards were stationed in all
the corridors.
Maitre Labourie, who was counsel
for M. Zola during the latter's famous
trial, was seated among the lawyers,
and Mme. Dreyfus, wife of the prisoner,
was provided with a seat in a corner.
She was represented by Maitre Mor
naud.
The Dreyfus appeal case was called
immediately after the opening of the
court. Reporter Bard opened the pro
ceedings by referring to the scandals
aroused by the case, even before the
appeal for a revision of the trial was
demanded. He then reviewed the his
tory of the case from the arrest of
Dreyfus and said his condemnation was
for one of the crimes which inspire uni
versal horror and -which implicated
one of those in whom the country put
much confidence. Continuing, M. Bard
spoke of the efforts made to obtain a
revision of the case, referred to the de
nunciation of Major Esterhazy and re
viewed Mme. Dreyfus' appeal for a re
vision.
In so doing M. Bard said this appeal
was based on the assumption that the
bordereau was written by Major Ester
hazy. He then pointed out that there
â¢were suspicious facts which justify the
request for the revision. Mme. Drey
fus contended that her husband did not
write the bordereau, which some of the
experts reported he did write. The
court, therefore, would have to examine
these facts and decide whether a re
vision was justified.
M. Bard added that the appeal for a
revision was decided upon in conse
quence of ihe late Lieutenant Colonel
Henry's confession that he had forged
a document in the case; but Bard said
this forgery was committed in 1896. and
could not alone be regarded as ground
for a revision or for an annulment of
the judgment rendered in 1894. Not
v/ithstanding the fact, M. Bard said
that Lieutenant Colonel Henry had
committed forgery, his evidence was
most crushing against Dreyfus, but, he
continued, the vidence of a forger is
open to suspicion. There was, there
fore, the preiumption of innocence,
based upon fresh facts that led to the
appeal for a revision of the case and
there was also ground to ask whether
or not any other fact had been brought
to light, and if Dreyfus was really the
author of the bordereau and note writ
ten to Major Esterhazy and found in
the apartment of Mme. Pays, in
â¢which the writer asked what be should
do respecting the bordereau.
M. Bard next read Colonel Paty dv
Clam's report of the arrest of Dreyfus,
then captain in the French artillery,
doing staff duty, in which the colonel
said that Dreyfus, while writing at his
dictation, "betrayed intense excite
ment."
"But," M. Bard added, "the photo
graph taken of this writing does not
give the slightest indication that Drey
fus was laboring under excitement."
Dreyfus, M. Bard also said, denied
to Colonel Paty dv Clam that he had
ever had relations, directly or Indirect
ly, with foreign powers. Colonel Paty
dv Clam's report further showed that
Dreyfus had to write Incriminating
documents in ten different ways, sit
ting and standing, with and without
gloves and with ordinary and broad
pointed pens.
Later M. Bard cited further facts
favorable to the revision and expressed
astonishment at the manner in which
the whole affair had been conducted.
He referred to the fact that the resi
dence of Colonel Picquart had been
searched, while the residence of Major
Esterhazy, who was directly accused,
was not searched.
The reporter also severely criticized
Major Ravary's report on the charge
against Major Esterhazy, and he fur
t,her saicl that the handwriting experts,
Benhomme and Varnierd, were luna
tics, whose testimony was unreliable.
After referring to the fact that the
experts who examined the bordereau
differed widely In opinion, M. Bard con
cluded by expressing the belief that, as
the bordereau was the principal factor
in the condemnation of Dreyfus, on the
testimony of experts his condemnation
ought to be revoked.
Great stress was laid by M. Bard on
Colonel Picquart's letter of July 14, 1898,
to t*iÂ« Minister of Justice, In which
The San Francisco Call
!he gave seven principal arguments
against the probability of the guilt of
Dreyfus, including the impossibility of
I Dreyfus procuring the plans of fort
i resses and projects for the movement
I of troops, unless detected, whereas
, Major Esterhazy had free access
! thereto.
This letter also cites Interviews which
Colonel Picquart had with Generals
Billot and Gonze and says: "With the
proof In his hands I have established
the innocence of Dreyfus."
To this General Gonze replied, accord
ing to the letter to the Minister of Jus
tice: "What is it to you if Dreyfus is
on Devil's Island?"
"Colonel Picquart â But he is inno
cent."
"General Gonze â You know Mercier
(former Minister of War) and Saussier
iformer Military Governor of Paris)
I are mixed up in this affair. Do you
| wish to compromise them?"
The letter then continued that on
leaving General Gonze Colonel Picquart
declared he was convinced of the inno
cence of Dreyfus and that he proposed
to fight the matter out and reveal what
he knew.
These statements upon the part of j
Reporter Bard caused a sensation in the :
court.
After further reference to Colonel i
Picquart's message that the Minister |
of War and the general staff had tarn- |
pered with documents and had manu
factured evidence in the Dreyfus ease,
and a presentation of the contradictory
statements of Colonel Picquart and the
Minister of War relative to the secret
documejit alleged to have been commu
nicated to the court, the hearing of the
case was adjourned until to-morrow.
The courthouse was emptied quietly.
There were no demonstrations and no
cries of any sort.
During the session of the court an
anti-revisionist mob numbering about
100 persons, and headed by MM. Drum
mont, Mulvoye and Lasies, shouting
"Vive l'Armee!" and "A Morte les
Juifs!" attempted to enter the Court
of Cassation. But the passage of the
mob was barred by the police and
large reinforcements were sent to guard
the approaches to the court.
The belief is general to-night that the
Court of Cassation will pronounce
neither for revision nor annulment of
the decision In the Dreyfus case, as
either course would entail awkward
consequences.
To avoid these it is expected the
court will decide that as the affair now
presents itself there has been no trea
son, and that therefore the condemna
tion pronounced upon Dreyfus by the
court-martial cannot be upheld.
The Courier dv Soir says that the
revelations in the report of M. Bard
before the Court of Cassation as to- the
part played by some members of the
general staff have produced a strong
effect in military circles and are "likely
to result in a reaction tending to put
an end to the antagonism between the
civil and military authorities."
The sensation of M. Bard's report was
the shorthand notes of the examina
tion of the late Lieutenant Colonel
Henry by M. Godfrey Cavaignac, then
Minister of War, after Henry's forgery
had been discovered. These notes
showed that the confession of forgery
was only obtained with the utmost dif
ficulty, Henry stoutly denying and then
prevaricating to the effect that he had
only added one phrase to the genuine
letter, and then, when driven to the
last corner, protesting that he acted for
the country's good.
The drift of M. Bard's conclusion was
that Comte Esterhazy was the real cul
prit, but his condemnation would mean
the ruin of the Intelligence Department.
M. Bard dwelt severely on the with
h6lding of the secret dossier from Drey
fus himself, as the presenting of the
documents to Dreyfus could not have
compromised the national Interests, and
said the course adopted was in flagrant
vioiation of the French prisoners' code
since 1888.
Although the meetings so far are fa
vorable to Dreyfus it must not be as
sumed that there will be any reaJ clear
ing up of the mystery. It looks rather
as though an attempt, is being made to
stifle the real truth by liberating Drey
fus without a new trial.
It is asked by the Dreyfusites if
the secret dossier exists, as alleged,
what good purpose can be served by
the Court of Cassation giving a decis
ion without seeing it, since that is the
only real proof, if any, of the guilt of
Dreyfus?
To-morrow's sitting of the Court of
Cassation is awaited with the most in
tense anxiety.
FAILED TO PROTECT
ARMY FROM SLANDER
LONDON, Oct. 27. â The Paris corre
spondent of the Dolly News says: The
SAN JFRAtf CISCO, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 28, IS9B.
THE PALACE OF JUSTICE, PORIS,
Where ti)e Court of Cassation Is Sitting in tbe Revision of the Dreyfus Case.
NEW CABINET
FOR FRANCE
PARIS, Oct. 27.â President
Faure, at 9 o'clock this evening,
asked M. Dupuy to form a Cabi
net in succession to the Brisson
Ministry, which resigned on
Tuesday. It is thought that the
Cabinet will be composed as fol
lows:
M. DUPUY, Premier and Min
ister of the Interior.
M. DE FREYCINET, Minister
of War.
M. CONSTANS, Minister of
Justice.
M. DEL. CASSE, Minister of
Foreign Affairs.
M. RIBOT, Minister of
Finance.
M. BOURGEOIS, Minister of
Public Instruction.
M. Dupuy has asked until to
morrow to decide. But he will
doubtless accept, unless unfore
seen difficulties arise.
M. Dupuy, who was inter
viewed as he was leaving the
Elysee, said the question of the
Dreyfus revision was purely ju
dicial, adding: "No honest poli
tician will decline to accept the
difficulty which shall be given."
Brisson Cabinet was overturned osten
sibly because it failed to protect the
army from slander. The real facts are
that the Ministers constantly but vainly
urged the staff officers to take proceed
ings against their slanderers. General
Mercier, General Seurildinen and Gen
eral Chanoine all declined to assist the
Government to vindicate the army's
honor on the plea that it was useless to
proceed against filthy newspaper rags.
General Chanoine's resignation was
timed to prevent the civil power getting
hold of the Dreyfus dossier. It was
calculated that If he went out slam-
ming the door the Government would
be beaten by Parliament, afraid of hav
ing the army and the people against it.
The coup was fixed for to-day (Thurs
day), but M. Roulede's sting provo-ked
Chanoine to precipitate the matter.
However, the desired object has been
accomplished. M. Brisson was unable
during the suspension of the sitting of
the Chamber on Tuesday to obtain M.
Faure's signature for the nomination of
a new Minister at War. Had he suc
ceeded the secret dossier would now be
before the Court of Cassation, but M.
Lockroy, who was then ad intrim War
Minister, could not take the Initiative.
The custodians of the dossier can re
fuse to let him see it.
WOULD VIRTUALLY MEAN
DECLARATION OF WAR
PARIS, Oct. 27.â At 9:30 o'clock to
night a report reached here that Salis
bury and members of his Cabinet had
voted to proclaim a protectorate over
Egypt. The statement was circumstan
tial and was accepted as authentic
wherever it gained currency. It was
too late for it to become generally
known except on the grand bojulevards,
but there the effect was electrical. The
news spread consternation in the clubs
and cafes. For the first time in the
present crisis Paris stopped discussing
the Dreyfus case and talked of the war
at its very doors.
It is terribly significant of how such
a step on the part of Great Britain
would be met here that no other inter
pretation was put upon the story ex
cept that it was a declaration of war.

HOUSTON, Oct. 27.â At Richmond,

PEACE PflÃflDE
PresideQt' McKJnley Reviews a
Pageant in Whicl) Are
Many Heroes.
PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 27.â For three
hours to-day William McKinley, com
mander-in-chief of the United States
army and navy, saw his victorious sons
pass in review before him. It was mili
tary and naval day of the great peace
Jubilee. Twenty-five thousand men
marched In the most brilliant and spec
tacular pageant the country has wit
nessed in many years. In a semi-cir
cular inclosure of the big reviewing
stand, in the magnificent court of
ho-nor, the President stood erect and
uncovered throughout the entire pro
cession. As the legions marched past
his face was set, but not stern, and in
his eyes was a gleam of satisfaction.
From his steadfast gaze one might
have fancied him listening to sounds
other than those which struck on the
common ear â sounds of deeper import,
telling the meaning of this glittering
panorama. Behind those martial tunes
he might have heard the music of can
non volleys, the sound of falling cities
and the dying shrieks of a decadent
people. But over these and louder he
might have heard peans of praise from
a helpless infant nation, lifted out of
servitude and cruelty by the work of
the embattled hosts.
Here and there, when some particular
renowned body of troops marched by,
the President pleasantly waved his hat
and motioned the crowds across the
way to cheer.
Mrs. McKinley reviewed the proces
sion from a small stand on top of the
conservatory of the Lippincott man
sion, back of where the President stood.
There was not an untoward feature
of the day â the weather tonic, autumn,
sunlit, gusty: the vast crowds were
handled with commendable skill and
whatever accidents occurred were of
the most trivial character. Over the
President's head hung a canopy bear
ing on its face the coat of arms of the
United States and surmounted by the
new President's flag, for the first time
unfurled in the United States.
During the parade the President was
surrounded by a small party consisting
of Vice President Hobart, Secretary of
War Alger, Secretary of Agriculture
Wilson, Postmaster General Smith, Pri
vate Secretary Porter, Mayor Warwick
and a few members of the jubilee coM
mlttee.
Mr. McKinley rose early this morn
ing and after a light breakfast taken
In his Bellevue apartments he and his
party were driven in open carriages
along the route of the parade, about
seven miles in length. The drive was
of course marked by Incessant applause
from the crowds. While driving up
Broad street he passed General Miles
and his staff, who were riding to the
place of formation. The moment the
general's sword made its salutary
sweep the President arose in his car
riage and raised his hat, holding it aloft
until they had passed. Returning to
the Bellevue, the Presidential party
was escorted by a squadron of the First
City Troop of Cavalry across Broad
street to the reviewing stand. They
had been preceded a few moments by
Generals Shatter, Lawton and Chaffae,
with their aids and a party of ladies.
Ten minutes later, at 11:25, the platoon
of the emergency corps, which held the
head of the line, reached the stand,
and from then until 2:30 o'clock the sol
diers and sailors tramped on in splen
did marching order, every sword raised
in salute, every gun presented.
Many illustrious heroes were in line,
but there w-as little partiality displayed
in the kind or quantity of enthusiasm
accorded the men.
Major General Miles, as chief mar
shal, rode at the front, immediately
behind the emergency corps, until he
reached his special reviewing stand at
Broad and York streets, the northern
end of the route. Here he dismounted
and from the stand watched his men
file past.
General "Jo" Wheeler rode behind the
Governors, his gray head bared for
some minutes before and after the
Presidential stand was reached, and
bowing repeatedly to the President's
waving hat and the applause of the
others of the party and the people genv
erally.
General Sumner, Captain "Bob"
Evans, Commodore Philip, Captain
Sigrsbee, Colonel Huntington, with his
marines of Guantanamo fame, all re
ceived tumultuous greeting, but, after
all, perhaps the loudest ovation was
that given Hobson and his Merrimac
crew. They rode on a tally-ho, and as
they reached the reviewing stand all
arose, faced the President and bowed
their bared heads.
So far as any body of men was con
cerned perhaps the Twenty-first Reg
ular Infantry, "the President's own,'*
received the greatest tribute. They
marched 300 strong under Col
onel McKibben. With them marched
the "fighting musicians" of the
regiment, the men who, in the
thick of the combat, flung their instru
ments from them and made music with
the guns snatched from their falleu
brothers. There are only twenty left
of the original thirty-eight bands
men. The others fell in the fight. The
Twenty-first carried the colors pre
sented to them by Mrs. McKinley, who
called them "the President's own," and
also those given by a lady of New
York City.
The Tenth Cavalry, colored, was dis
mounted, and to them the President re
peatedly nourished his hat.
Huntington's marines, who made the
first hostile landing on Cuban soil,
were immediately preceded by the Ma
rine Band.
Of course the highest degree of local
enthusiasm was bestowed upon Colonel
Hulings and his Sixteenth Pennsyl
vania Regiment.
The sailors were no less well received
than the soldiers. A line of jackies
from the Texas, Gloucester, Mayflower,
Marblehead and New Orleans, with a
few scattering men from the Tosemite,
Yankee and other ships, followed.
The rear of the line was held by the
Grand Army of the Republic and their
allied military organizations. As these
ancient warriors filed past with none
too lusty step they saluted the Presi
dent in their own way. Some waved
their hats, others timorously raised
their hands in the conventional way,
while several companies halted, turned,
and, fronting the chief executive, pre
sented the tattered battle flags. One
of the posts carried a battery of two
guns and saluted with a shot from each
as the stand was passed. The President
responded with a sweep of his hat and
continuous bows. Between two of the
Grand Army of the Republic posts rode
TRIBUTE TO THE
ARMY AND NAVY
PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 27.â
President McKinley was given
an enthusiastic reception when
he entered the beautifully deco
rated dining-room of the Clover
Club with Postmaster General
Smith and Secretaries Alger and
Wilson. In response to the pa
triotic Introduction of Colonel
McClure "the President of the
United States referred pleasant
ly to the fame of the Clover Club
and then, after a reference to the
imposing pageant of the after
noon, said:
As I stood on the great review
ing stand witnessing the soldiers
and sailors passing by my heart was
filled only with gratitude to the God
of Battles who has so favored us,
and gratitude to the brave soldiers
and sailoYs who had won such sig
nal victories on land and sea and
had given a new meaning to Amer
ican valor.
It has been especially gratifying
to me to participate not only with
the people of Philadelphia but
with the people of the great West,
where I have recently visited, in
doing honor to the American navy
and the American army. No no
bler sailors or soldiers ever fought
under the flag. You have witnessed
to-day the leaders of Santiago,
Porto Rico and Guantanamo. We
have unfortunately none of the
heroes of Manila with us. But I
am sure that our hearts go out to
them to-night and to the brave
Dewey and Otis and Merritt and
all the other gallant men that are
now sustaining the flag in the har
bor and city of Manila. (A voice,
"How about the Hobson?")
The American people are always
ready, for any emergency, and if
the Merrimac is to be sunk there is
an American officer to do it. He
succeeded in doing what our foe
has been unable to doâ sink an
American ship. (Applause.)
I ask you, gentlemen of the Clo
ver Club, to unite with me in toast
ing tne army and navy of the Unit
ed States, without whose valor and
sacrifice we could not celebrate the
victory we have been celebrating
to-day. Not only the men at the
front; not only the men on the
battle-ships and In the battle line;
but the men at home with ambi
tion to go to fight the battles of
American civilization should be the
recipients of the gratitude of the
American people.
As the President passed from
the room General Miles entered.
The head of the army received
an ovation as he pressed through
the crowd to his seat next to
General Shafter. The latter
arose as General Miles ap
prooached, reaching out his hand
and cordially greeted his chief.
The public exhibition of good
feeling between the two gen
erals was greeted with almost
deafening applause.
in a carriage Harry L. Macneal, who
had charge of a gun on the Brooklyn
and who crawled out over the side of
the ship while under fire to extract a
shell which had become fixed in the
muzzle.
Passing the Presidential stand the
troops marched in "company front"
formation, In three-step cadence, one
third faster than the regular time. In
nearly every instance the marching
was almost faultless.
As the last line of soldiers and the
body of police behind them passed the
stand the crowds broke through the
ropes and made a rush toward the
President's inclosure. He merely bowed
his acknowledgments of the cheering
and then withdrew to the rear of the
stand and to the residence of Mrs. J.
Dundas Lippincott, immediately back
of the stand. Here the party took
luncheon and shortly afterward the
President retired to his hotel to spend
in rest the time remaining until the
Clover Club dinner and the Academy
of Music reception at night.

BROUGHT TO THEIR SENSES

WITH AMERICANS.
A Long Step Taken Toward the Con

tions â The Philippine
Question.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, Oct. 27.â The Spanish Peace
Commissioners have accepted the nega
tive view of the United States commis
sioners toward the proposed assumption
by the United States of the Cuban debt.
The American commissioners havo
firmly but courageously declined to as
sume for the United States the entire or
Joint responsibility for the Spanish
financial conditions, and the Spanish.
commissioners have finally abandoned,
the effort and have agreed that the
Cuban article of the protocol shall,
without conditions, have a place in the
ultimate treaty of peace. It was not
until Monday that they became con
vinced that the Americans, who had,
at the outset, made a refusal to accept
the Cuban debt, meant exactly what
they said.
In spite of the fact that the Spanish
commissioners 'sad as a background to
their efforts doubts of suceeding, their
hope of so doing has been so keen and
their contention has been so vigorously
prosecuted that the final conviction of
their inability to win their point
brought the Spaniards such a shock
and depression that consistently with
the dispatches at the time there were
grave doubts as to the continuance of
the negotiations.
In support of these statements is the
fact that Senor Montero Rios, after
Monday's session and on Tuesday last,
| would have resigned the presidency of
j the Spanish Peace Commission had he
I not believed that his doing so might
have grievously shaken, if it had not
unseated, SefTof Sagasta's government.
From this standpoint, if for no other
reason, Senor Montero Rios maintained
j his position, and at yesterday's session,
j acting under the conviction arrived at
| on Monday the Spaniards anrounced
that they would forego further argu
ment on the Cuban debt and agreed
that, practically in the terms and ab
solutely in the spirit of the protocol,
the article about Cuba should go for
ward into the final treaty.
Thus Spain agrees to relinquish
sovereignty ov a r any claim to Cuba
without either terms or conditions.
All differences, if any existed regard
ing Porto Rico and the selection of the
island of Guam, were also arranged by
mutual understanding, and the com
missioners found themselves well nigh
touching the Philippine question, which
will be taken up next week.
It should be said that the adjust
ments already accomplished will stand
in the final treaty unless opposing
views and positions on the Philippine
question should develop hereafter and
bring to naught the efforts of the fu
ture and at the same time the results
already obtained.
SPAIN MUST YIELD
UP THE PHILIPPINES
NEW YORK, Oct. 27.â The Herald.a
Washington correspondent says: Now
that the Spanish Commissioners in
Paris have yielded to the refusal of the
American Commissioners to entertain
their proposition regarding the Cuban
debt the peace negotiations are thus
brought down to the disposition of the
Philippines, but it was the expectation
of Secretary Hay, when I saw him to
day, that this would be formally
brought up on Monday next.
While the authorities still refuse to
make public any of the instructions to
the Peace Commissioners it can be
stated upon unquestionable authority
that the President is thoroughly con
vinced there is no possible way for the
United States to escape responsibility
of the control of the entire Philippine
group, and it may be assumed that the
instructions which have gone to the
American Peace Commissioners in Paris
mean the relinquishment of Spanish
sovereignty of all parts of the Philip
pines shall be demanded.
A high official, thoroughly acquainted
with what transpired during the delib
erations at the White House on Tues
day night, says:
"Neither the American Commission
ers nor the President can do anything
else than insist upon Spain giving up
everything in the Philippines. The peo
ple in this country will not stand any
thing else. The President has been
made to fully understand this in a more
forcible manner than ever by the flood
of letters which continues to pour in
upon the White House from religious
bodies of all creeds and from every sec
tion of the country, not to speak of the
commercial interests, which have been
clamoring for American control of the
Philippines ever since the protocol was
signed.
"Annexation of the Philippines seem*
now to be the logical outcome of the
situation, but in insisting upon this de-
mand the Commissioners, on the part
of the United States, will be given con
siderable latitude as to the settlement
of questions between Spain and the
Philippines, and especially the Philip
pine debt. If the islands are to be an
nexed to the United States Spain might
reasonably require this country to as
sume at least so much of the Philip
pine debt as represented moneys ex
pended for the improvement of tha
islands."2

TO BE REMOVED FROM
THE CIVIL SERVICE
A Presidential Order Looked For That
Will Affect Several Thou
sand Places.
"WASHINTON, Oct. 27.â 1t la under
stood that a Presidential edict removing
a large number of Government officers
from the civil service will probably be
promulgated before Thanksgiving day.
The order is one which has been in con
templation many months, having been
deferred from time to time owing to
pressure of war business. As at present
determined upon the order will affect up
ward of 6000 places. It will include dep
uty Collectors of Internal Revenue who
are authorized to become acting collec
tors, actually serving in that capacity.
There are about 2000 of these deputies.
The largest class affected is i..c corps of
examining surgeons of the Pension Bu
reau, of whom there are in all over 4100.
There seems to be a general understand
ing that it will be better to have these
left out of the civil service, although Sec
retary Bliss, while understood to favor
such- action, would not recommend it.
Over 3000 of these surgeons are stated at
the Civil Service Commission never to
have been classified under the civil ser
vice law. The order will clear up the mis
apprehension as to the actual status of
the whole corps and place them all out
side. About fifty office deputy marshals
heretofore reported as classified, but con
cerning whose status there has been some
doubt because of their being in the judi
cial branch of the service, are expected
to be placed in the exempt class. There
are other scattering positions. Including
some of a fiduciary and confidential char
acter, which will aggregate possibly sev
eral hundred.
Oil Lands in Litigation.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 27.â Two bills in
equity involving portions of the Coalinga
oil lands near Fresno have been filed in
the United States Circuit Court here. One
is the California Oil and Gas Company
against E. O. Miller and the New York
Oil Company. The allegations in this suit
are that the land was filed upon as a
mlne'ral claim in October, 1891, and that
the claimants sold their rights to the
plaintiffs, who have since complied with
all legal requirements. In the second bill
most of the parties mentioned as claim
ants on the first bill are named, and the
Dewey Mining Company asks for an in
junction to prevent the Home Oil Com
pany from extracting oil from a certain
parcel of land.
Receivers Appointed.
NEW YORK, Oct. 27.â Justice Cohen of
the Supreme Court to-day appointed
Frederick W. Da" of Elizabeth, N. J.,

ceivers for the New York Woodenware
House, a New Jersey corporation with a

Sheriff's Force Sent to Capture Bene

the Band After a "Run

Special Dispatch to The Call.
BAKER CITY, Or., Oct. 27.â A B pecial j
from Canyon City states that a young
man, who was a member of the Sher
iffs' posse has just returned to Canyon
City with a report of a desperate fight
which occurred between the whites and
a renegade band of Indians. The nine
teen white men and five warriors were
about forty feet apart when the battle
began. George Cuttings, son of David
Cutting-s, received a ball in the left
arm, the bullet then passing through
his lungs.
One of the Indians, who was shot and
killed, fought with desperate courage.
After having been repeatedly wounded,
he continued firing his rifle until it
was empty, then fired his revolver un
til the muzzle dropped so low that the
bullets struck the ground near the dy
ing redskin's side.
George Cuttings, after having re
ceived his wounds, started In company
with M. Mozier for Izee, near the scene
of the trouble. The wounded man be
came so weak that he was left near the
trail, propped up against a tree. When
the searching party went to look for
Cuttings they found him dead near a
spring, to which he had crawled.
The posse continued in pursuit, and
after a running battle killed all of the
five Indians.
Settlers have sent to Canyon City for
more ammunition, stating that the In
dians are gathering around Izee in
large numbers.
The trouble arose over the Indians
accusing the whites of stealing horses.
MINING MAN SHOOTS
AT A TOLLKEEPER
Charge of Fine Shot Ruins the Hat
on His Intended Victim's
Head.
REDDING. Oct. 27.â George A. Fitch, a
well-known mining man of Shasta, Is
out on bail in this city on a charge of
assault with a deadly weapon with in
tent to kill. Fitch was returning over
the Camden toll road from a visit to the
Coffee Creek section of Trinity County.
He reached the Camden tollhouse, near
the town of Shasta, at 8 o'clock this
morning, driving In a spring wagon. The
toll gate was closed. Howard Shoemaker,
the keeper, came out to collect the toll.
Fitch asked what the toll amounted to,
and was told that 50 cents was the
charge. Fitch replied that he had passed
over the road many times In the same
rig for 35 cents. The He was passed.
Fitch asserts that he paid the 50 cents
and then demanded his change, Shoe
maker, according to the same version,
threw off his coat and declared that he
was ready for any kind of a fight. Shoe
maker reached for his hip pocket, Fitch
says, and Fitch then discharged his shot
gun at Shoemaker's head. The charge of
quail shot tore off the brim of the toll
keeper's hat and passed Into a window of
the house. Miss Katie Murray, a guest
of the Shoemakers, was struck by sev
eral shot, but was uninjured.
Fitch drove on to Redding. Shoemaker
telephoned from Shasta to arrest the
mining man. He was arrested but was
subsequently released on giving $1500 bail.
According to the tollkeeper's story the
6hooting was unjustifiable on any ground
of self-defense, as no attempt was made
to draw a weapon. Shoemaker darod
Fitch to shoot and Fitch raised his shot
gun and fired pointblank at the tollkeep
er's head.
Some time ago Fitch was one of the
leaders in an agitation against exorbi
tant toll rates, and It is believed there
was ill feeling between the two men.
There were no other witnesses and it is
doubtful if a conviction can be had.
Miss Murray, the young lady who was
hit by glancing shot, Is a resident of
French Gulch. She was visiting Miss Ida
Mosher, a stepdaughter of Howard Shoe
maker.

HAVANA HARBOR
FREE OF MINES
Assurance Given That
Ships Will Be Safe.
TO AGREE UPON EVACUATION
JOINT SESSION OF THE COM
MISSION ARRANGED.
â  â 
The President Decides Not to Dis
patch Any Men-of-War to
to Cuba for the
Present.
Special cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1898, by James Gor
don Bennett. â¢
HAVANA, Cuba, Oct. 27.â A joint
session of the commission is called for
10 o'clock to-morrow morning in the
Camera Insular. Among other things
the final date for the evacuation Is ex
pected to be agreed upon.
The American Government before
sending ships to Havana has instructed
the commission to determine definitely
whether any torpedoes or mines still
remain in Havana harbor. General
Parrado to-day sent the American com
mission his assurances that the harbor
is absolutely clear of mines and tor
pedoes and safe for any vessel that
may wish to enter.
The American commission has rented
a large house in rear of the trocha,
which will be fitted up as a hospital
where any person in ill health in future
may receive proper care.
"With the sale of the Circulo Milltar
last night snapped almost the last link
of Spanish military and social life in
Havana. For fifteen years it was the
home of officers and was presided over
by each succeeding Captain General,
Blanco being its last honorary presi
dent. It is worthy of remark in noting
the change in the situation that the
purchaser will make the old home of
the Circulo Militar an American-Cuban
club.
NEW YORK, Oct. 27.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent says: Not
withstanding the earnest recommenda
tions of the American Evacuation Com
missioners in Havana that warships
be sent to that port no such action will
be taken by the administration. I
learned to-day that Admiral Sampson,
the naval member of the American
commission, recently wrote to the Navy
Department calling the attention of
Secretary Long to the difficulties un
der which he and his colleagues were
laboring. The admiral suggested that
it would be advisable to dispatch a few
small .vessels to Havana and stated
that the effect of their presence would
undoubtedly be to make the Spanish
Commissioners more compliant to
American demands and less impudent
in their action in removing and dispos
ing of guns.
General Wade had written oji the
same subject to the War Department
and had reinforced his mail report by
a cable messag* Secretary L,ong called
the attention of the President to the
requests received from the commission
ers and before the President's depart
ure the matter was carefully con
sidered. As a result I understand a
decision has been reached not to dis
patch any men-of-war to Havana for
the present.
The commission has received instruc
tions, of a stringent character which
will require them to peremptorily de
mand that the removal of immovable
property cease at once and it is be
lieved in view of this instruction direct
from Ihe President the Spaniards will
not continue their objectionable course.
MUST SERVE A FULL
THREE-YEARS TERM
Status of Volunteer Soldiers Who
Re-enlisted in the Regular
Army.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 27.â 8y direction
of the Secretary of War, Colonel Thomas
Ward, acting adjutant general, has is
sued a general order In regard to the case
of members of volunteer organizations
who enlieted therefrom in the regular
army. It is explanatory of a previous
general order issued in September last,
prescribing that such men will be given
credit for service in the volunteer
army. The indorsement required by the
regulations on the enlistment papers of
men who have served in the volunteer
army and subsequently enlist in the regu
lar army results in giving to such sol
diers credit on the recorus of the depart
ment for time actually Berved in tne vol
unteer service, but without intention that
the terms of enlistment or re-enlistment
in the regular army shall be shortened by
reason of volunteer service.
According to the order just issued such
soldiers begin a new enlistment in the
regular army for the full term of three
years and tnelr clothing allowance like
wise begins at the first year's rates. The
age limitation of 35 years for original en
listments in the regular army does not
apply in such cases. The principal ad
vantage, however, accrues to those who
re-enlist in the regular army within three
months from date of discharge from the
volunteer army. In their cases the time
actually served in the volunteers is added
to the time served in the regular army
in computing the soldiers' service pay
from time to time."
Future enlistments and re-enlistments
in the regular army will not be governed
by the same rules which ootaineil during
the war with Spain. On May 10 last Ma
jor General Miles, with the approval of
the Secretary of War, issued an order an
nouncing that "mer enlisted or re-en
listed in the regular .irmy during the war
may be informed that they will oe grant
ed their discharges if desired at the close
of the war upon their individual applica
tions." Major General Miles to-day is
sued an order revoking the previous or
der and announcing that its provisions
wifl not govern in tne cases of men here
after enlisted or re-enlisted in the regular
army. Under this action enlistments or
re-enlistments in the regular army will
be for a term of wiree --"ars, regardless
of the present status of the negotiations
with Spain for peace.

Agent Vaille at Manila Reports the
Service Better Now Than
Under Spanish Rule.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 27.â United States
Postal Agent Vaille at Manila has sub
mitted a report to the Postofflce Depart
ment on the postal operations there. Pie
says everything is moving satisfactorily
and that the largest business houses re
port the mail facilities much better than
at any time under Spanish rule. He
speaks in glowing terms of the island and
expresses the hope that the United States
will retain it. He says there is room for
millions of people. He adds that on Sep
tember 19 he had a short talk with Agui
naldo about the mails in the provinces
under Aguinaldo's control, wnere the
former Spanish officials are out and there
is no regularly constituted postal author
ity in charge. Aguinaldo, who has prom
ised to send a representative to distribute
the matter, was told that If he could sat
isfy the agent that the mails sent out
would be delivered to their addresses in
proper condition, they -would be forward

SENDING POISON THROUGH THE

Several Similar Cases Where the
Postoffice Authorities Have
"Been Powerless to
Act.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Rlggs House,
Washington, Oct. 27.
Thus far the Postofflce authorities
have received no intimation of the de
termination of Chief of Police Lees of
San Francisco and Detective McVey.
representing the State of Delaware, to
appeal to the postal authorities to take
some action in the matter of the ex
tradition of Mrs. Cordelia Botkin, ac
cused of the poisoning of Mrs. J. P.
Dunning and .Irs. J. Deane of Dover,
Del.
It appears that these officers have
scant knowledge of the powers of the
Postofflce Department in such matters.
The sending of obscene matter through
the mails is a punishable offense and
many convictions have been secured
under this charge. The sending of
poison through the mails is simply a
misdemeanor and consultation with the
Attorney General of the Postofflce De
partment fails to reveal a single in
stance where punishment was meted
out to those guilty of this offense.
It will be recalled that about three
years ago Dr. Graves of Boston was
accused of sending poison through the
mails, which resulted in the death of
a wealthy woman of Denver, Colo. It
was known through later developments
that he was the beneficiary of her prop
erty and life insurance. An attempt
was made at that time to have the
postal authorities take a hand in the
prosecution, but as Dr. Graves had
violated none of the laws of the de
partment entailing punishment they re
fused. Dr. Graves feeling sure that he
could not be convicted went voluntarily
to Denver to stand trial. He was con
victed by evidence other than that of
sending poison through the mails, but
cheated the gallows by committing
suicide.
Only a few months ago a man In
New York city was proved to have sent
poisoned liquor through the mails on
three separate occasions to his intended
victim. In that instance also the postal
authorities were calk-d upon to insti
tute proceedings against the sender,
but the same conditions that existed in
the Graves case were found to hold in
this. It is believed by the authorities
here that if hope of convicting Mrs.
Botkin depends upon the action of the
Postoffice Department there is little
likelihood of her punishment.

FOR VIOLATING THE

WASHINGTON. Oct. 27.â Ex-Governor
Charles A. Bussiel of New Hampshire
has preferred charges with the Civil Ser
vice Commission against the members of
the Republican State Committee of New

butions, and has written to the Comptrol

issued by the Republican State Commit
tee and sent to Federal office holders

NO SUITABLE CAMPSITES.
Merriam Advises That Few Troops
Be Sent to Honolulu.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 27.â The report of
General Merriam, commanding the De
partment of the Pacific, regarding the
facilities for a camp at Honolulu has been
received at the War Department. It is
not favorable, as he finds the ground on
the higher levels Is covered with rocks
while the low lands and valleys are
swampy, the lands being used chiefly for
rice cultivation. There are no good drill
grounds, and he advises that as few
troops as possible be sent to Honolulu.
Camps cannot be established to any ad
vantage, and it will be necessary to con
struct barracks for troops stationed there,

The Greatest Trouble During tne
Cuban Campaign Was the
Lack of Smokeless
Powder.
Special Dispatch to . The Call.
HUNTSVILLE, Ala., Oct. 27.â The
War Investigating Commission began
its work to-day, with Captain Augues,
who was in the quartermaster's depart
ment at Tampa. He said that for a
time the department was swamped
there, but he attributed the congestion
to the railroads.
Captain Cutter, an Ohio volunteer
surgeon who had charge of the ambu
lance corps at Tampa, said there was a
shortage of ambulances there and that
the camp conditions were bad.
Colonel Duffy of the Sixty-ninth New
York, said his command had never
lacked commissary supplies, but there
was some delay in furnishing quarter
master stores. The sick had been well
cared for, and while he had seen some
criticism in the New York newspapers,
he thought most of the sickness origi
nated in the swampy camp at Tampa.
There they had to dig only six inches
for water and there were no tent floors.
He said there had been sixteen deaths
in the regiment.
Captain Charles V. Parkhurst of the
Second Artillery detailed the partici
pation of the artillery in the siege of
Santiago. There were times when his
men did not have time to eat, but there
was no time when they , did not have
food. There was also plenty of forage
for the horses. He was wounded twice
on the, 2d of July and his wounds were
dressed within a few minutes after
they were received.
First Lieutenant Conklin of the Sec
ond Artillery, who was in the Santi
ago campaign, said the only material
defect In the supplies was in the pow
der, which he thought should have been
smokeless. He said that in going to
Cuba the guns and horses were separ
ated, but he understood this could not
be avoided. He was the only member
of his battery, officer or man, who had
not been sick as a result of the Cuban
campaign,, but" he did not think the
sickness could have been prevented.
Major. Lebo, in command of the Sixth
Infantry, complained of the difficulty
of : securing lumber, firewood, horse
shoes and stoves in the camp here.
He also said the tents were of poor
material and ' leaked even when new.
He also said there. had not been suffi
cient medical supplies in Cuba, and
that the transport Gate City, in which
the command ; came north, was poorly
suited to the purpose.
; Captain Stretch ,of the Tenth Infan
try gave in detail the hardships of the
regiment during the San Juan fight.
He . said there was no time when the
men had nothing to eat, but he did not
remember -having drawn a â  full ; ration
while in Cuba. He said the sick of thÂ«
command were fed at Montauk better
than they had ever been in their lives.

WELCOMED BY VAST CROWDS
"BRAVO, HERBERT," AND "GOD

Police Have Trouble in Rescuing the
Hero of the Soudan From the
Enthusiastic Throngs
at the Depot.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
DOVER, England, Oct. 27. â General
Lord Kitchener of Khartoum arrived
at Dover this afternoon from Paris and
was frantically cheered by the enthu
siastic crowds of people assembled to
â¢welcome him home. He was met at the
landing-place by Major General Sir
William Butier, the military com
mander of this district, and the Mayor,
corporation and local functionaries.
Later General Kitchener was presented
with an address of congratulation.
LONDON, Oct. 27.â General Kitch
ener arrived here this afternoon and
was greeted by the commander in chief
of the British forces, General Lord
"Wolseley, and other high military offi
cers. The Grenadiers formed a guard
of honor at the railroad station, and
General Kitchener received an ovation
from the enormous throngs of people
assembled to welcome him back from
Egypt. The scene of enthusiasm was
almost unprecedented.
The crowds at the Victoria station of
the London, Chatham and Dover Rail
road was so dense that the police were
unable to cope with them. The bar
riers and the police cordon were carried
away together, and the multitude
surged Into the reserved portion of the
station.
As the Sirdar issued from the royal
waiting room, expecting to step into
his carriage, he found himself con
fronted with an impenetrable mass,
cheering-, gesticulating and shouting,
"Bravo, Herbert; God bless you. my
boy," "Cheers for the avenger of Gor
don." and kindred cries. His face
beamed with pleasure at the popu
lar greeting. "When he attempted to
make his way through the crowd his
â hat was "mashed in," and the police
had to save him forcibly from the
crowds of the enthusiastic guards, who
endeavored to carry him on their
shoulders through the throng.
All attempts to clear a passage were
futile. The Sirdar was forced to re
tire, and was finally smuggled out of
the station through a distant corner of
the building.
DANGER OF FRICTION
REPORTED REMOVED
LONDON, Oct. 27.â Although nothing
official has transpired regarding the
deliberations of the Cabinet council
yesterday, the Times says It may be
taken for granted that the decisions
reached are in full agreement with the
policy formulated in the recently pub
lished blue book.
The Daily Mail understands that an
arrangement has been arrived at which
removes all danger of friction with
France.
The Rome correspondent of the Times
says: "I learn that Prince Louis Na
poleon, who was supposed to have re
joined his regiment in Russia, is really
at Geneva, where he was raised, on
special security, a loan of such dimen
sions as excludes the hypothesis of its
being to be reouired for private pur
poses. Prince Louis has long been a
candidate of the Bonpartists for the
French throne in preference to his
brother, Prince Victor.
"COIN" HARVEY HAS
NOT BEEN REMOVED
Chairman Jones Says He Is Still in
Control of the Democratic
National Finances.
LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Oct. 27.â United
States Senator Jones, chairman of the
Democratic National Committee, arrived
in this city luis evening. The Senator
authorized the following statement in re
gard to the published statement in vari
ous newspapers announcing that he had
removed Mr. Harvey from the manage
ment of the affairs of the ways and
means committee of tne National Demo
cratic Committee, and that he had an
nounced the scheme conducted by Har
\>y was a rare disappointment to him,
and that ex-Governor Stone of Missouri
would take Mr. Harvey's place on No
vember 1. Senator Jones stated that the
whole story was a fabrication, without
a semblance of truth In It. He said he
went to Chicago a few days since to look
over Mr. Harvey's plan, as he felt great
Interest in its success. So far from being
dissatisfied with Mr. Harvey or his plans,
he was, in fact, very much pleased with
both and that careful examination of
what has been accomplished and the
plans for future work had inspired him
with the utmost confidence in the suc
cessful movement, and he wishes all
friends of the cause to know that the con
fidence felt by him in Mr. Harvey at the
time of his appointment has only been
confirmed by patient investigation of his
work. The statement that there has been
any friction between Mr. Harvey and
himself, or that there had been any fric
tion on any material point or want of
confidence in Mr. Harvey, he says, is a
fabrication and entirely without founda
tion in fact.
PROSPEROUS NEW MEXICO.
Governor Otero Shows Why State
hood Should Be Granted.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 27.â Governor
Otero of New Mexico, in his annual report
to the Secretary of the Interior, vigorous
5* renews his representations for the ear
ly admission of New Mexico to Statehood
and portrays the undeveloped resources
of the Territory awaiting capital.
He estimates the total population of the
territory now at 282,900, Including an In
dian population of 25,900.
Of the 11W) officers and men from New
Mexico in the war with Spain at least
one-half were National Guardsmen. The
report embodies a letter from Colonel
Roosevelt written from Santiago under
date of July 2T>th, commending the be
havior of the New Mexico troopers in the
Rough Rider Regiment. The report lays
special stress on the possibilities of irri
gation and says all the water now use
lessly running away, shortly will be util
ized to the highest degree. Meanwhile
individual enterprise is erecting a multi
tude of windmills throughout the Terri
tory.

SACRAMENTO, Oct. 27.â A young Eng
lishman, who gives the name of Arthur

MADISON, 111., Oct. 27.â "1 reiterate
that I will not tolerate this wholesale im
portation of foreigners into Illinois, and
I hear that another mob is to be brought |
into this Star^ such as was taken into I
Virden I care not on what railroad it '
comes, or for whom, I will meet it at the
State line and shoot it to pieces with
Gatling guns."
So declared Governor Tanner in a
speech delivered before 1200 auditors gath
ered at the Knights of Pythias Hall in
this city. It was the concluding state
ment of an address largely devoted to a
defense of his course in the recent strike
In Virden. The Governor reviewed at
great length the causes leading up to the
rioting. He held the operators to be at
fault in their dealings with the strikers,
and then, reverting to his acts when the
crisis came, said:
â 'When the United States Government
found it necessary and deemed it best to
forbid the importation of foreign labor
Into this country, I felt I was fully justi
fied in the course I took at Virden. That
trouble never would have occurred if the
negroes had not been brought here to
take the places of white men. The im
portations were representatives of the
scum of the country. I do not propose to
allow the operators to bring these people
here, and I took what I considered and
still consider the proper means to prevent
Then followed his uncompromising dec
laration that any train entering the State
under similar conditions in the future
would be met at the border and shot to
pieces with Gatling guns.
CHICAGO, Oct. 27.â The Tribune to
morrow will say: The coal operators of
Illinois, interested In the Virden situa
tion, are preparing a petition to be pre
sented in the United States courts for an
injunction to prevent Governor Tanner

SAN MATEO HEARS
FOOTE AND CRAIG
Democratic Gathering Addressed by
"Ole Bill" and the Candi
date for Congress.
SAN MATEO, Oct. 27.â The Democrats
>f San Mateo and vicinity held an enthu
siastic Jollification to-night. Addresses
were delivered by \Y. W. Foote and Wil
liam Craig, the latter the regular Demo
cratic nominee for Congress in the Fifth
District. Preceding the meeting there
was a parade, while throughout the town
red fire and rockets assinted the faithful
in a display of their exuberance. The
demonstration almost arose to the dimen
sions of a Fourth of July celebration.
Duncan Hayne presided at the gather
ing-, and seated upon the stage were many ;
of the prominent Democruts of the vicin
ity. ]n his address Mr. Foote touched i
on national a#d State issues, and then i
launched upon a eulogy of Mr. Craig, j
He and the candidate for Congress were j
schoolmates together, and since that '
time he had watched the career of his
former chum with keen interest. He re
garded him as a statesman to whom the
people of California could intrust their
interests, confident that the State would
be well represented upon the floor of the
House. The career of the nominee in j
the field of politics was reviewed and his |
record in office praised. The speaker de- j
clared that the voters of the Fifth Dis
trict would be casting their ballots for a !
statesman, an honest man and a gentle- I
man when they placed the "X" opposite
the name of William Craig. The speech
of "Ole Bill," as the Democratic war
horse is known to the rank and file of
his party, was witty and forcible, and
he was frequently interrupted by the ap
plause of his auditors.
Mr. Craig 1 delivered an extended speech, I
dealing with the issues before tigs people â â 
of California in this campaign and his j
own candidacy for Congressional honors.
He pledged himself, if elected, to work
for the best interests of the State and
the masses of the people, and declared
that In the future, as in the past, he
would be free from corporation Influences
and control.
At the conclusion of the meeting the
nominee shook hands with many men
prominent in local Democratic councils.
Mr. Foote declared that from what he
had seen and heard in San Mateo County
the county would roll up 400 plurality for
Magulre and the balance of the State
ticket, and he was confident that Craig's
plurality would exceed these figures.

NAPA'S CHEERING
THOUSANDS GIVE
GAGE GREETING
Monster Meeting in
the Open Air.
PARADE AND PYROTECHNICS
STANDARD-BEARER AND MR.
KNIGHT SPEAK.
Veterans at the Yountville Home
Receive a Visit From the Next
Governor of the Golden
State.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NAPA, Oct. 27.â Henry T. Gage, the
Republican standard bearer in this
campaign in California, arrived in
Napa this forenoon and was enthusi
astically greeted at the depot by many
representative Republicans. He was
escorted to the Palace Hotel by T. B.
Hutchison and G. W. Strohl, chairman
of the Napa County Central Commit
tee. In the reception at the hotel
there were no formalities. Many citi
zens came forward and greeted the
next Governor, assuring him that Napa
County would return a large majority
for the Republican cause.
This afternoon Mr. Gage visited the
Veterans' Home at Yountville, where
he received a great ovation from the
veteran soldiers and sailors. The party
that went from Napa to Yountville
was guided by Mr. Strohl. The next
Governor rode in Drury Melone's car
riage along with T. B. Hutchison, one
of the gifted orators of Northern Cali
fornia. In other conveyances were G.
W. Strohl, C. T. Masteller, J. C. Cur
rier, P. S. King, secretary of the Coun
ty Committee; M. L. Megladdey, Dr.
Hennesey, E. S. Gridley, R. A. Brown
lee, G. M. Francis, John Brott, M. M.
Haaa, G. S. McKenzie, J. B. Clifford,
Mr. Cory, Owen Wade and Judge Elgin.
On the return trip Mr. Gage tarried for
a short time at Oak Knoll, the home of
Drury Meione.
The band played a welcome when Mr.
Gage arrived at the Veterans' Home.
Social hall was soon filled by the vet
erans and citizens from the neighbor
hood. C. T. Masteller called the meet
ing to order and introduced to the au
dience "Henry T. Gage, the next Gov
ernor of California." A tremendous
shout hailed the introduction. Mi.
Gage did not make an elaborate speech,
as he felt constrained to reserve his
strength for the great open air meet
ing in Napa to-night. What he did
say was lofty in its tone of patriotism
and so clearly expressed that the vet?
erans cheered him at the conclusion of
every sentence. He maintained that
the American flag should wave wher
ever it had been planted by the valor
and blood of American soldiers and
sailors. He pronounced against the
surrender of one inch of territory
wrested from Spain. A storm of ap
plause signified the appreciation of the
audience. The fusion leaders who had
sought to disfranchise the veterans re
siding in the homes for disabled volun
teers were held up to scorn. "Little
Giant" Maguire's refusal to support the
war revenue measure in Congress re
ceived the comment that the unpatri
otic course deserved.
J. Wade McDonald followed Mr. Gage
and spoke for an hour on the political
questions of the day. He spoke as a
veteran to veterans, and made telling
points in favor of the grand old party.
The audience arose and sang
"America," and was about to disperse
when Drury Melone arose and made a
brief suggestion, requesting that time
be given to allow the next Governor to
meet the ladies assembled. Mr. Melone
observed that "the hand that rocked
the cradle ruled the world." The viÃit
of the standard-bearer was prolonged
to shake hands with the ladies. Many
of the veterans were also presented.
George A. Knight, one of the eloquent
exponents of Republican principles, ar
rived this evening and was cordially re
ceived by the committee and escorted
to the Palace Hotel.
To-night the great procession of
cheering- Republicans, the rockets, the
music, the red fire, the transparencies
with pertinent mottoes, created the
wildest enthusiasm. The procession was
marshaled by G. "W. Strohl, and In
line were Henry T. Gage and George
A. Knight. Thousands of spectators
lined the streets on either side of the
route and cheered the passing columns.
To attend the great outpouring of the
masses to proclaim against the scheme
of single tax citizens came from all
parts of beautiful Napa Valley. A big
turnout was expected, but the magni
tude of the demonstration and the
great number of visitors assembled
surpassed predictions. The procession
was creditable In the highest degree,
as it largely represented the actual in
dustrious and progressive men, who
have established the character of the
community for enterprise and Intelli
gence. Among the striking mottoes
reflected by the Illuminations were:
"Maguire's Single Tax Means the
Farmers' Double Tax," and "Maeruire
Stands for Single Tax, Confiscation and
Anarchy."
In the open air on the courthouse
prrounrts 4000 people gathered to in
spire the Republican speakers and place
their seal of condemnation on the
odious scheme of single tax. The mul
titude was called to order by S. E.
Holden, who named the following vice
presidents: Q. M. Francis. J. A. Mc-
Clelland, Clifford Roper. J. H. Lovejoy,
Thomas McÃain, Joseph Levinson, R.

Applause prolonged and mighty hailed
the introduction of the nominee for
Governor. When the cheering subsided
so that his voice could be heard Mr.
Gage acknowledged his appreciation of
the magnificent reception. He did not
accept it as a tribute to himself, but
as an expression of the general devo
tion of the masses to the cause which
he represented. Speaking of his tour
of the State and the great enthusiasm
everywhere manifested he said he was
convinced that the Republican party
would on the Sth day of November
achieve the greatest triumph ever
scored in California. The people were
alarmed at the danger of fusion. Their
intelligence had pierced the fallacies of
the single tax. Maguire had sought to
obscure the real and vital issue of the
campaign by shouting "Railroad! Rail
road:" But the tactics of the fusion
leader had not deceived the people.
Maguire's record on the railroad ques
tion was fully ventilated. The Congres
sional Record was produced as proof
that the "Little Giant" was endeavor
ing to deceive the people on this ques
tion. The fact was made clear to the
listening thousands that one word of
objection from the "Little Giant" would
have defeated the measure.
Mr. Gage spoke for over an hour and
convinced the people by his frank and
manly way of presenting facts that he
represents the best interests of the
commonwealth; that he is free now and
always has been free from corporate
influences. In a simple, straightfor
ward manner he gave a pledge to the
enlightened citizens of Napa County
that he would as Governor endeavor to
administer the affairs of the high office
in an honest and economical manner;
that he would use the best judgment
God has given him in the service of
the State. The sentiments of patriot
ism which he expressed in his admir
able address to the assembled thou
sands evc-ked a volume of great en
thusiasm. Cheer after cheer rent the
air.
Another signal for great applause was
the introduction of George A. Knight.
Mr. Knight delivered one of the most
forcible and convincing speeches of the
campaign. He turned the rays of truth
on Maguire's record in Congress on the
railroad settlement. He drew a word
picture of the "Little Giant" prancing
around the State of Delaware and talk
ing single-tax while important meas
ures were under discussion in Congress.
Words were not minced in speaking
of Maguire's pretensions before the
public at this time. The point was ad
vanced that if Maguire was so anxious
for more legislation to regulate the
railroads he ought to be seeking re
election to Congress from the Fourth
District. As Governor the only bill
that he could introduce was his own
bill, which had often been introduced
in the public treasury. Mr. Knight en
joined the Republicans to support the
whole ticket and not to be swayed by
the campaign lies circulated to injure
the cause of Justices McFarland and
Van Fleet.
The eloquent utterances of the orator
commanded the earnest attention of the
assemblage. His magnificent voice and
clear enunciation made it possible for
those standing at a long distance from
the speakers' stand to hear distinctly
every word uttered. His review of what
the Republican party had accomplished
for humanity, what the organization
had done to make people better, hap
pier, and more prosperous, elicited
shouts of commendation. Cheer after
cheer greeted his ringing declarations.
The great popular uprising to-night
in support of Gage and x\eff Is a re
buke to Maguire and single-tax. Tt has
inspired the Republicans of this valley
with fresh courage and a stronger de
termination to increase the Republican
majority beyond the records of the
past.
To-morrow Gage and Knight will
journey to Sonoma County and address
the people of Petaluma and Santa Rosa.
NEFF MEETS SAN
JOSE REPUBLICANS
Compliments the Good Government
League Upon Its Splendid
Work.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 27.â Jacob Neff, the Re
publican candidate for Lieutenant Gov
ernor, was a caller at the headquarters
of the Republican Good Government
League to-day. He was accompanied by
Captain Ellis and Mr. Colnan of San
â¢Francisco. The old warhorse of the Re
publican party met many orchardlsts and
farmers, who assured him of their sup
port. Mr. Neff complimented the Good
Government League upon the work It was
doing and especially praised the fine ban
ner across the street and cards bearing
his picture and that of Gage issued under
direction of Mitchell Phillips.
The members of the Good Government
League have requested the State Central
Committee to have Major Frank Mc-
Laughlln preside at the Gage meeting to
be held Tuesday night. The majority of
Republicans in the county also favor Mr.
McLaughlin for chairman, and his presid
ing would be the means of making many
votes for the Republican State ticket. The
Republicans of Santa Clara County have
been split in two under the leadership of
Rea and the Mackenzies. It is believed
that should the state committee send Ma
jor McLaughlin here to preside at the
meeting the Republicans would be reunit
ed so far as the State ticket Is concerned.

End of the Exodus Near
at Hand.
SOME LUCKY, OTHERS BROKE
SOUTHBOUND STEAMERS HAVE
MANY PASSENGERS.
Communication With Dawson City
During the Approaching Win
ter Promises to Be Not
Infrequent.
BY HAL HOFFMAN.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
JUNEAU, Alaska, Oct. 18 (by steam
ship City of Seattle to Victoria, B. C,
Oct. 22.)â The end of the rush out of
Dawson by the up river route has
reached the coast and the volume of
travel south will be greatly decreased
from this date. The steamboat war is
still hot, and rates to the Sound have
been cut more than half. This week
the fare has been $12 first class and $8
second class to Seattle. Before an
other week goes by, if the competition
continues, the steamboats may be car
rying; people for running and feeding
them for the privilege of having them
aboard. One ship, the Rosalie, played
a neat trick on the Pacific Coast
Steamship Company's Al-Ki and the
City <>t" S-attle, which were both lying
in port here bound north. She
dropped a boat over the side and sent
the mail to Juneau by two deck hands,
from the lower end of Douglas, and
then skipped for Skaguay with as much
more steam and as many more turns
in her screw as she could raise, in or
der to catch the southbound crowd
from the trail. She dropped her pas
sengers for Juneau on the down trip.
Many more advantages for getting
out of the Yukon will soon be availa
ble than were offered last winter. On
this account communication with Daw
fun promises not to be infrequent. The
work of establishing police and relief
posts thirty miles apart from Lake
Bennett to Dawson is almost com
pleted. Capacious cabins have been
built, and over 100 tons of provisions
packed over the Chiikoot I'usa for
these posts. These thirty-mile sta
tions are as much for the purpose of
facilitating communication between
Canadian Government officials from
Dawson to the coast, Victoria and Ot
tawa, as for relief of needy new com
ers. A thirty-mile trip from post to
post can be undertaken in any kind of
weather, as it is only a day's travel.
It may be possible to send mail Into
Dawson from Juneau or Skaguay dur
ing the approaching winter in from ten
to twenty days, or on an average in
less than half the time that the trip
was made last winter. For this rea
son considerable travel may be ex
pected both from and to Dawson, and
with the advantage of not having to
break trail through the snow. Much
of the news from the new diggings at
Atlin Lake will also come around by
Lake Bennett.
For almost a week every bed has
been occupied in Juneau and all the
hotels packed by Copper River ana
Cooks Inlet people and Dawsonites
awaiting southbound ships. In two
weeks more, with the last trip of the
Dora and Excelsior, no more people can
get out of the westward sections of
Alaska till next spring. Tne mining
results in the Cooks Jnlet country, ope
rations having been impeded by unus
ually high water, were told in a pre
vious article. Altogether about $6000
of Cooks Inlet dust was sold to banks
and exchanged at business houses here
this trip for immediate use. It brought
$15 50 an ounce. It is estimated that
the season's clean-up in the Cooks In
let placer mines will not exceed a total
of $50,000.
Lieutenant L. "S. Kelly of the Tenth
United States Volunteers, and ten men
of Captain E. T. Glenn's expedition be
yond Cooks Inlet, have reached here on
their way south. This Government
party went from Portage Bay to Ka
nik Inlet, thence over 100 miles up the
Matanuska River and down the Gerstle
River, a tributary of the Tanana, 100
miles, whence a view of the vast valley
of the Tanana was had. Provisions
ran short here and the main party had
to return to Sunrise City. Lieutenant
Castner of the Fourth Infantry and
two men continued on down the Ta
nana to Circle City. Colors of gold
â¢were found on a number of streams.
The country is timbered with spruce,
birch and cottonwood, which will ave
rage ten-inch boards. It is both roll-
Ing and mountainous, with plenty of
grass for horses, and dotted with lakes
large and small. Lieutenant Kelly
said the party passed seventy lakes
In one day. He thinks much of th<>
country can be made agricultural. Cap
tain Glenn Is still at Klonack. They
saw but little game and only a few
Indians in a total traveled distance of
360 miles, their extreme distance north
being 200 miles.
The steamer Brixham, which ran
aground on Lincoln Point reef, about
thirty miles south of Wrangel, early
last Friday morning, still lies in al
most her original position, on an even
keel, but has listed to port somewhat
by the action of the waves. Her bot
tom Is now said to be torn to holes, and
it is thought by steamship men that
she cannot be saved.
CONCLUDING A WHEEL
TOUR OF THE WORLD
Mr. and Mrs. Mcllrath of Chicago
Nearing the End of Their
Journey.
NEW YORK. Oct. 27â H. Darwin Mc
llrath and his wife, of Chicago, arrived
liere to-day from Southampton, England,
â¢n the American line steamship Perm-
Jand. The Mcllraths started on a wheel
rng tour on April 10, 1595. from Chicago.
They crossed the Rockies and on June 1
arrived in San Francisco. There they
took a steamer for China. The couple
rode through that country and then pro
ceeded through Japan. Their route was
afterward through Burmah, India. Per
sia, Russia, Austria-Hungary, Germany
France and Great Britain. The Mcll
raths had ridden nearly 30,000 miles when
they boarded the Pennland for New
York. They had some exciting experi
ences in Asia and India, but were not
molested by the natives. They Intend to
ride from this city to Chicago, and the
start will be made in a day or two. Un
der the auspices of the Century Road
Club of America, of which the couple are
members, relays of riders will accompany
them on their last thousand miles. The
trip it Is expected will take twenty days.
Receptions will be given them at Albany,
Rochester, Buffalo, Cleveland and other
places, and a large body of cyclists will
welcome them home.

AT LEAST EIGHT LIVES LOST

DROWNED.
The Three-Master St. Peter Goes
Down Off Sodus Point in Sight
of a Tug Sent to Her
Rescue.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ROCHESTER, N. V., Oct. 27.â A
special to the Herald from Sodus says:
The three-masted schooner St. Peter, of
St. Vincent, sank this afternoon about
five miles northwest of Sodus, on Lake
Ontario, with all on board, save Cap
tain John D. Griffin, who was rescued
in a precarious condition.
The schooner showed signs of dis
tress early this morning as she drifted
past Charlotte. During the forenoon
the people of Pultneyville sighted her
and immediately telegraphed to Sodus
Feint asking that help be offered. The
tug Cornelia started for the rescue, but
the great seas nearly swamped the boat
and the Cornelia was compelled to re
turn to the harbor. Word was sent to
Charlotte that the distressed vessel had
been sighted near Pultneyville, and the
tug Proctor started with the life
saving crew. When within a mile of
the St. Peter the crew on the Proctor
were horrified to see the ship sink.
In ten minutes the tug was cruising
about the spot where she went down.
Captain Griffin was picked up in an un
conscious condition. After spending a
half-hour looking for the other mem
bers of the crew the tug started for
Sodus Point, where medical assistance
was secured for the captain. He is
still unconscious, but will recover.
The wife of the captain was lost, as
was Mate McLaren of Kingston. At
least eight persons perished.
Olen Jolly and Jacob Serburg o-f this
town were standing on the shore when
the St. Peter went down and declare
the boat was not more than a half-mile
from the shore. It is thought that the
St. Peter lost her rudder and that the
heavy seas caused her to spring aleak.
The St. Peter was bound from Oswego
to Toledo with 700 tons of coal.
LOUISVILLE DEFAULTER
CAPTURED IN LONDON
Charles G. Henning, Who Absconded
With $8000 Bank Funds,
Under Arrest.
LOUISVILLE, Oct. 27.â Chief of Police
Haager to-day received a notification that
Charles G. Henning. who absconded from
the Bank of Louisville with $8000 several
weeks ago, had been captured in London,
England.
Young Henning bore a name well
known and honored throughout Ken
tucky and the adjoining States. He is
the son of John W. Henning, who for
many years prior to his death, soms
twelve years ago, made up the celebrated
firm of Hennrng & Speed, real estate
dealers and capitalists. Joshua Speed,
the junior partner, was a brother of James
Sp-ed, President Lincoln's Attorney Gen
eral, and whose warm and intimate
friendship for the martyred President
dated from very early days when, as a
young storekeeper in Springfield, 111., he
first met Air. Lincoln. This connection j
with the President gave the firm great
influence at a time when much money
was to be made in handling real estate.
A; Mr. Henning's death he left each of
his two sons some $350,000 and his interest j
in the business. Charles Henning, with i
his brother, was largely interested in the
reorganization of the several lines of
street railways in New Orleans Into one
general concern known as the New Or
leans Traction Company. The enterprise
was not a financial success and young
Henning, with se%eral others, is said to
have lost the greater part, if not the
whole of his fortune. His family connec
tions easily secured Tilm a position of re
muneration and trust in the Bank
of Louisville, of which his father
had for thirty years been a di
rector, and he was generally thought
to be retrieving his losses, when
j a short time ago the news of his ab- |
sconding with $8000 of the bank's funds j
! fell like a thunderbolt on the community, j
WEED BELIEVED TO
HEAD A SYNDICATE
May Be Working to Obtain a Foot
hold in the San Domingo
Republic.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 27.-Careful in
quiry at the Navy Department demon
strates the absolutely unofficial maracter
of any commission such as that said to be
headed by Smith M. Weed, which was re
ported recently at Nassau, B. W. 1., In j
conference with President Heureaux of j
San Domingo. It is said that Captain Con- j
verse of the Montgomery may have taken j
Mr. Weed on his ship as a guest. The i
Montgomery has been ordered from New
port to Charleston to participate in the
peace jubilee In the latter city, and Cap- j
tain Converse obtained permission to j
touch at Nassau en route.
It is believed here that Mr. Weed Is the !
representative of an American syndicate i
which has agreed to administer most of
the affairs of the Dominican Government,
collecting customs receipts in return and
paying a large sum yearly to the of
ticials of the island. Some such scheme as j
this has been opfrated by an American
syndicate In Honduras for several years !
with marked success, it is asserted, and j
this may have attracted the attention of I
speculators to the possibilities of other |
Central American and West Indian coun-
tries.
So far as any proposition to buy or ac
quire Samana Bay as a United States
coaling station is concerned, naval au
thorities declare there is no truth in the
story. The Samana Bay project was a
favorite of President Grant, but has not
taken serious shape since, and is less pos
sible of consummation now that the
United States has splendid facilities of
Its own in the matter of coaling stations
on the island of Porto Rico.
JUSTICE FIELD IS
NOT AT DEATH'S DOOR
His Sister Denies Recent Reports
Regarding the Alarming Con

WASHINGTON, Oct. 27.â A representa
tive of The Call who visited the residence
of Justice Field to-day was told by the
sister of the aged jurist that there was
absolutely no foundation for the alarm
ing reports printed in San Francisco con*
cernlng his condition.
"He is, of course, very feeble," said his
sister, "and receives no visitors, but this
has been the case for a year, and there
has been no change in his condition to
warrant such reports. Justice Field sits
up, reads and takes his sleep and meals
the same as usual. Mrs. Field is not
well, and it may be that this fact gave
rise to the story that my brother is vory
ill."

LEGISLATIVE
TICKET WILL
BE ELECTED
Hon. F. M. Leavitt Is
Warmly Received.
REPUBLICANS ARE POSITIVE
ALLIANCE PROGRAMME FOR A
BUSY WEEK.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
90S Broadway, Oct. 27.
Two years ago the Republican legisla
tive ticket was elected in this county
without a break. On that occasion one
Senator and six Assemblymen were elect
ed. At the coming election two Senators
and six Assemblymen are to be elected,
and there is no doubt but that the Re
publican ticket will be entirely success
ful.
One of the most active campaigners for
the legislative ticket is Frank A. Leav
itt, who two years ago was elected to the
Assembly and made such a good record
that when the late Eli Denison declared
his intention, long before his death, of
quitting politics, it was regarded as fit
ting and proper that his Senatorial mantle
should fall on the shoulders of Assembly
man Leavitt. Mr. Leavitt has recently
gone all over his district and his con
fidence in the success of the Republican
ticket has been materially strengthened
by his experiences with the voters. He
has also canvassed the situation in re
gard to the Assembly candidates and says
there is no room for doubt as to the re
sult. At the many meetings which he
attended Assemblyman Leavitt was very
enthusiastically received and assurances
of support were given him by many who
are utterly disgusted with the peculiar
antics of the so-called fusionists.
President Lukens of the Republican Al
liance has Issued the following orders:
Saturday, October 29â The Alliance muÃt turn
out at home. Hon. Henry T. Gage will be In
Oakland at the tabernacle. Report at head

ing, at which the Union League Drill Corps
will be present.
Monday, October 31â The Alliance goes to San
Francisco. The State Central Committee has
given the Alliance a special Invitation to pa
rade that night, and the Union League will
entertain the Alliance at their club rooms in
the Palace Hotel after the parade. This is to
be San Francisco's big demonstration.
Friday, November 4â The Alliance is Invited
to escort Hon. Victor H. Metcalf from Fruit
vale Station out Fruitvale avenue to a meeting
arranged by East Oakland and Fruitvale Re
publicans. After the meeting the Alliance will
be given a bullshead supper at Fruitvale.
Saturday, November sâwill5 â will be an Alliance
night at the Macdonough Theater. Hon.
George C. Perkins and Hon. Victor H. Metcalf
will be the speakers. An Alliance supper will
be given our Congressional candidate and
United States Senator after the meeting, at
which honorary members of the Alliance will
be invited.
Let every member of the Alliance go to San
Francisco Monday next, October 31, on the 6:45
p. m. train. The 7 o'clock will get you there

Claims He Barely Escaped Becoming
the Victim of Porkvihe
Sharpers.
CHICAGO, Oct. 27.â Count Leopold de
Bovitlz of Bucharest, Roumania, was ar
rested to-day on a charge of obtaining
$8 75 by false pretenses. The Count
claims that he is a victim of a clever
confidence game In which it was Intended
that he should be swindled out of $6000.
As a result of his suspicions he caused
the arrest of Marvin Victor Henshaw,

shaw and D. J. Hallaman, lawyers.
The Count came to Chicago several days
ago upon ihe solicitation, he Bays, of
Ernest Salvator, a playwright. He be
came Interested in a play written by Sal
vator, and was introduced to Martin Vic
tor Henshaw. Henshaw, according to the
Count, agreed to stage the play if Bovitlz
would furnish the money. The Count did
not have any ready money, but volun
teered to send to Roumania for the nec
essary amount. Henshaw gave him $8 75
with which to pay for the cablegram, and
when the money was not forthcoming a
warrant was obtained for the nobleman's
arrest. Bovitiz was arraigned in the
Criminal Court to-day, but the hearing
was continued until November. Mr. Hen

MARRIES HIS WIFE.
Slater Was Not Sure the First Knot
Was Tied Securely. â¢
SAN RAFAEL. Oct. 27.-" Well, I guess
we were married before all right enough,
but my wife's and my relatives made so
much ado over court decisions and one
thing and r another ; that we decided to
have the knot tied in conventional style."
This was the rather peculiar explana
tion given to-day by James Slater, a ship
joiner employed by the Union Iron Works,
after he had been united to Mrs. Anna B.
Pierce of 537 Alvarado street, by Justice
Gardner. According to Slater, both were
divorced persons when they wished to
marry a year ago, but Slater had not
been divorced a year. â â¢â  In order to avoid
the law providing that a divorced person
could not marry within a year after the
decree was granted, they ; went- to Monte
rey and were married at sea by Rev.
George Snodgrass. Their relatives made
such a protest that they finally concluded
to be united in "conventional" style;
hence to-day's ceremony. ,~" -; j-r

"Industry," the leading Populist paper
of California, published at Oakland,
October 27, 1898:
POPULISM DIES IN THE CESSPOOL
OF DEMOCRATIC CORRUPTION.
After the fusion convention at Sacra
mento, the chairman and secretary and
fifty-seven members withdrew from the
San Francisco People's Party County
Committee, leaving It in possession of A.
B. Kinne, George Silvey and other Demo
cratic office-holders. One of the Gal
laghers openly boasted to a member of
the committee that he owned the commit
tee and had paid for it. Money was of
fered openly for votes in the interest of a
fusion delegation at the election of the
delegates to Sacramento, and the fare
and expenses of most of the fusion dele
gates were paid with Democratic money.
After the Democratic ring got Maguire
nominated it completely ignored what re
mained of the Populist County Commit
tee in San Francisco. The Phelan Demo
cratic convention met and nominated a
full ticket of Democrats, never noticing
the existence of the Populist Piece Club
run by Kinne, Silvey & Co.; not a Popu
list was nominated by the Democrats.
Then the Populist fusion Piece Club re
solved itself into a convention and put up
Its indorsements for sale, indorsing both
Democrats and Republicans in a dis
gusting, loathsome manner. Men were
taken into secret session before terms
were arranged. The price was small, but
more than the indorsement of such a
piece club was worth. Not a straight
Populist was nominated. Carroll, a sore
head Democrat who failed of a Demo
cratic nomination, was given a nomina
tion for Justice of the Peace, and H. W.
Philbrook, who ran in 1896 as candidate
of the A. P. A. party, was nominated
and will get less votes than he got when
he ran as an A. P. A. alone. These, we be
lieve, are the only ones not nominees of
other parties.
On Thursday night they went through
the farce of a ratification meeting. The
first speaker was Phelan, an open gold
bug, followed by several Democratic
nominees. Not a Popuiist speech was
made or a Populist heard of.
So expires in the cesspool of rotten poli
tics the party which once commanded
honor and respect. Yet bribe-taking can
didates on the fusion ticketâ bribed by
officeâ and their organs have the gall to
denounce the men who have spen t years
to build up the People's party, simply be
cause they have tried to preserve It and
kee~ it from being strangled to death in
this loathsome manner. May an all-mer
ciful God forgive them. If He does it will
not be because they know not what they
do. They sold out at Sacramento for the
promise of office and salaries and went
back to their homes to receive the nom
inations for local offices, which was the
price of their votes. Such fusion should
be defeated by voting directly against it.
SMOKE DID NOT
OBSCURE THE FUN
POLITICS AND MIRTH AT NA
TIVE SONS' HALL.
Rincon Parlor Entertains and Is En
tertained by the Wit, Humor
and Talent of Its Mem
bers.
It was a "smoKer" Rincon Parlor No.
72, N. S. Q. W-, gave in Shasta Hall, Na
tive Sons' building Wednesday evening,
and it was the happiest gathering of
the season. The meeting was partly
social, but many aspirants for pub
lic office appeared during the evening
and were presented. They did not burden
the merry crowd with tales of politics ur
misconstructions of issues, however, but
joined in the fun. For instance, Charles
F. Kenneally, Republican and Citizens'
Republican nominee for the Assembly of
the Twenty-ninth District, quoted and
gave a few original essays far, far dis
tant from legislative matters, and Coro
ner Hawkins pulleu off his coat and "tore
off a few yards" on the piano that Chair
man Mogan stated would cause the dead
in the Morgue to seek other quarters if
played in that locality. The wit and tal
ent of the gathering was called upon to
do the entertaining, and in consequence it
was long after midnight before, the last
guest left the hall homeward bound.
A J Rocco opened the fun by deliver
ing an "essay" in Italian dialect, rich in
style, picturing Police Judge Mogan do
ing the neighborhood of the fish wharf
soliciting votes. He was promptly sen
tenced to serve a term of six months
twice a year by Mogan, and John Hoey.
candidate for Senator from the fc-i Knt ~
eenth District, was called upon to address
the audience. He pictured his hopes and
fears, and gave way to Edward Hanra
han who asked and stated that ne ex
pected the support of his comrades of
the parlor, which, he believed, would ma
terially aid him in his fight for the As
8 ChaVles Kenneall- who is confident that
he' will assist the next Legislature in its
labors, then took the floor and proceeded
to entertain the smokers. He was suc
cessful to such a degree that Mogan de
clared him elected without waiting tor
November 8. Joseph Hanson then sang a
song W. H. Growney made a ittle
speech, and D. E. Hanlon, in response to
a call, took the platform. Hanlon gave
Imitations of the efforts of the great
tragedians. Booth. Irving and Keane, and
the g ra vings of John McCullough. JUMH
H Barry. Finlay cook, Charles T. Con
lan Charles Myers, Justice of the Peace
Barry William A. Deane. Republican
candidate for County Clerk and Charles
Whelan were presented in turn and
played their part, and then Dr. Hawkins
rendered his "piano solo." Notwithstand
ing the solo the merriment went on, en
tertainers came to the front, speakers ap
peared until the rapping of the chair
man's gavel and a few brief words ended
the fun and all filed out to await the com
ing of another "smoker."
No Parade Needed.
The Republican parade committee held
a meeting Wednesday evening in the
Union League Club rooms at the Palace,
H. C. Flrebaugh presiding.
The report of the committee of five, ap
pointed at the last meeting to confer with :
the State Central and County commit
tees, resulted in a decision not to have
a parade this campaignâ it being the ]
sense of the meeting that the Republican
outlook was so favorable as not to re
quire any. It was thought best, how
ever, to preserve the organization. In the
hope that it might assist the State Cen
tral and County committees in watching
the polls. With this object In view, the
secretary was instructed to invite a rep
resentation from every Republican club
In this city to be present at the next
meeting, to be held at the samo place, on"
Tuesday evening next, at S o'clock.

By resolution the Society of Old Friends
has decided to complete the formulation

PHELAN'S WAIL
ON THE SUPREME
COURT DECISION
It is Arraigned byGeo.
C. Sargent.
ISSUE WITH THE MAYOR
JUDGES MUST NOT BE SWAYED
BY THE PUBLIC.
An Answer to the Hefter's Cry
to ' Beat Two ! Judicial
Candidates for
Office.
George C. Sargent has this to say in
regard to the criticisms passed by Mr.
Phelan upon the Supreme Court:
Editor San Francisco Call: In a recent
speech Mr. Phelan says:
I do not think that the courts are above
criticism, for we have an elected Judiciary.
Are they to sit in their places of power and
say or do what they please without any voice
from the people?
The people are responsible for the character
of the Judges, and when they desert the cause
of the people we can bide our time and beat
them when â ey come up for re-election.
There are two of them running for o.nce
now. Beat them and so uphold the hands of
good government, xhere Is a way of inter
preting the law In favor of the people, and
there Is a way of Interpreting it against the
people. When a court arrogates to itself the
power to say what the lawmakers Intended to
enact, then the court is arrogating to Itself
legislative power and Is giving us what Is
known as judge-made law.
Although not clearly expressed, the
meaning is unmistakable. The court Is
to take any view of the law which the
people at the time wish them to. They
are to listen to and heed popular clamor.
That Mr. Phelan's audience so under
stood him there is no doubt.
liis complaint is based upon the re
cent decision in the case of Fitch vs. the
Board of Supervisors, as a result of which
the present Board of Supervisors remain
in office. Mr. Phelan and others had ob
tained a judgment ousting them. The
movement was inaugurated by Mr. Phe
lan, another gentleman who acted as
plaintiff In the suit brought for that purv
pose, and some few othersâ not more than
a dozen in all. That is not enough to
warrant any of them in writing himself
"We, the people," and reviling the Judges
as deserters of the people when the court
renders an opinion adverse to their views.
The plaintiff in that action Is a temper
ate, law-abiding citizen. He thought he
had law for tne judgment he obtained.
But as yet he has not been heard to say
he wished the court to depart from well
settled rules and decide according to
clamor from the outside. So that it does
not appear but what "We, the people,"
means Mr. Phelan himself.
Therefore, even assuming that the court
should heed popular clamor, It does not
yet appear that the people have spoken.
But I wish to take issue at the very
outset with the speaker upon the propo- |
sitlon that the court should heed popular
clamor from any source whatever. The
Justices are put there to say what the j
law Is; not to Interpret it with favor to '
any side. If the people have a right to ;
be heard In any other manner through j
their chosen representative, the Attorney
General, they have a right tp speak per- !
sonaily, for themselves, and no single one I
can be excluded from the court. They I
have a right to parade through the halls
of justice, as did the Paris mob through
the chamber of the National Assembly,
and overawe the court by force of num
bers and threats to do what they wish in
the excitement of the momentâ to do
what the cooler judgment of the people
might later regret. .Nobody with any self
respect can permit this. Every Judge
whoso name is spoken with honor has
refused to be influenced by popular
clamor, while every one who has hark
ened to it is mentioned with contempt.
Mr. Phelan is in error when he says
the court has no right to arrogate to it
self the power to say what the lawmakers
inu-nded to enact. That is just what they
aro there for. And that intention, aa it
has many times been said, is to be as
certained from the words of the law
itself; by reference to the law repealed,
to see what it was intended to abolish
and the decisions in former cases. These
make a rule of decision which the court
cannot choose but follow. It has no
right to depart from it even for the ac
complishment of a temporary good, and
even though a temporary evil may re
sult.
The people of this State have made a
constitution which provides that we shall
have a Legislature to MAKE the laws;
courts to interpret them, and say what
they mean (not always easy); and an ex- j
ecutive to carry them out. When the
court departs from the terms of the law
to effect a temporary good, it nullifies it
to that extent; and since succeeding 1
courts must follow the construction thus
given the court in effect amends the law.
This is to trench upon the province of the
Legislature and to make, rather than in
terpret, the law. It is impertinent and
unlawful.
The court has only to say what the law
Is. If it is wrong, the people will take
care of that in the house of their elected
delegates â the Legislature. The court is
not called upon Dy the constitution to
make law for them; but only to tell them
what it is, in order that they may amend
it if it does not suit them.
Even a bad law is binding until repeal
ed. It is binding upon the court and
upon every citizen. It is the law-abiding
spirit which upholds officers and courts
in enforcing a statute until changed in
an orderly and legal manner which
makes self-government a success among
Anglo-Saxon peoples, and so difficult
among the Latins. Such people allow no
law, constitutional or other, to interfere j
with the pursuit of the present object. I
He is no friend who urges us to follow
such examples. Without this law-abiding
spirit, the most solemn constitutions ana
laws make but a rope of sand; and any
thing which weakens the sentiment, even
for the greatest possible temporary good.
Is a distinct injury to the foundation or
our institutions.
It Is a fact which Mr. Phelan does not
montion that not one word of either the
main or the concurring opinion in the de
cision referred to was written by either
of the Justices now arraigned. It waa
concurred in by the entire court â seven
Judges. They merely said, "We concur."
In viow of this his condemnation extends
to the whole court, and to every single
member of it. Ts it likely that all of them
deserted the people? Is it not more like
ly that one manâ Mr. Phelan â is misled
by passion, or disappointment, or error
of Judgment?
There is one gentleman in the court who
Is a Democrat; and whose honesty, good
judgment and devotion to his country have
never been questioned. Justice Temple,
also concurred in the opinion; he said, "I
concur." Yet for holding the same opin
ion as this eminent Jurist, Justices van
Fleet and McFarland are reviled as be
trayers of the people, who should be beat
en at the polls.
In conclusion, a word or two as to the
much criticized decision.
The constitution provides that the Board
of Supervisors shall fix water rates in
February of each year; and that they
shall take effect upon the first of July
next thereafter. The Legislature added
as a penalty, that if the board did not
fix the rates it should be convicted of
malfeasance In office and ousted. That
suit for that purpose could be brought by
any interested party. The board did not
fix the rates in February, but did before
the Ist of July, and when the time came
there were new rates to go into effect
at the time provided by law. On July
15, which was after the duty enjoined by
law had been performed, Mr, Fitch's suit
was brought. The court said the terra
"interested party" means some one who
is harmed by the failure of the board to
act. That when the suit was brought the
rates had been fixed, and were in force,
and that the plaintiff was, therefore, not
damaged, and so not an Interested party
within the meaning of the law. Before
July 1 the old rates were in force. Upon
the Ist of July the new ones were ready;
so that whoever else might have a right
to complain, a ratepayer could not, tor
the simple reason that all he could ask
was that he know at the proper time
how much coifld be lawfully taken from
him for the water used. Mr. Fitch sued

purely as a ratepayer, and alleged him
self to be sucn. â 
Briefly given, the above is the gist or
a long opinion. A controversy between
private persona would have beÂ«n decided
upon just those principles. It is hardly
necessary to*say that the same rule musj.
apply in all cases.
But there was another fatal objection
to the judgment which was pointed out
by Justice Garoutte, and which would
have caused its reversal if the first point
had not. The board had been convicted
of malfeasance in office as an entiretyâ all
of its individual members. Conviction of
malfeasance in office disfranchises nic
officer forever afterward. Three members
had sought earnestly to do their duty.
Yet these innocent three were disgraced
in law and disfranchised along with the
guilty. Such a law is contrary to the code
of every civilized nation. It is unconsti
tutional, unjust, outrageous, and no court
with any pretensions to fairness of mind
would sustain it. ..-_.Â»
Yet it is for failure to uphold this judg
ment and such a law that the Mayor says
of two of the unanimous seven: "There
are two of them running for office now.
Beat them, and so uphold the hands of
good government." Good government, we
are to infer, consists in punishing all
alike, the innocent with the guilty, and
refusing to apply a rule of decision to a
case in which the speaker felt a personal
interest, which the court would not apply
in any other case. . ..
I commend the moral courage of the
court that rendered this decision The de
cision itself I commend to the -voters of
the State as the best possible reason for
the re-election of the gentlemen against
whom the above remarks were directed.
Witâ¢such Judges, the fundamental rules
nf ritrht and wrong at least are safe, but
"/those whos^ "lection Mr. Phelan seeks
would uphold such a law we had better
leave them In retirement SA . RGENT .

THE GOSPEL OF
REPUBLICANS
Big Speakers Deal
With Party Truths.
LABORING MEN LISTENED
PHELAN -DONE BROWN 1 ' BY A
CONVERTED DEMOCRAT.
Attendance at Republican District
Meeting's Waxes Larger and
the Speakers Are Accorded
Hearty Reception.
There was another rousing Republi- j
can meeting in the Potrero last even- j
ing; another meeting of the laboring ;
men. Fully half a thousand of them
gathered last evening at the Potrero j
Opera-house, and many of them
brought their wives, to listen to Charles
L. Patton and others on the issues of
the day.
The speakers of the evening were
Julius Kahn, Alfred Morgenstern,
Charles L. Patton and John Lenehan.
Mr. Morgenstern began his speech
â with an argument for a national vote
of confidence in President McKinley
and in the course that the executive
has pursued through the late war with
Spain. He called attention to the fact
that it is only by electing Republican
Congressmen and a Republican Legis
lature to choose California's Senator
that this can be done.
Leaving State for local issues Mr.
Morgenstern said: "James D. Phelan,
my friends, thought that the Supreme'
Court was an angelic body until it com
pelled him to pay $63,000 in taxes that
he was trying 10 evade. Since then he
has had little use for that body, and he
has been holding it up to ridicule
through all of this campaign. Ho is
also holding up the railroad as a fac
tor in the coming election in spite of the
fact that he saved that company thou
sands of dollars by tearing up its old
track on Market street at the city's ex
pense at just the time when it was
about to tear it up on its own account.
And you don't want to forget that after
he had it torn up he paved a strip eight
feet wide with bitumen at the expense
of the city that the company by its
franchise was obliged to pave.
"The very convention that nominated
Mr. Phelan was contrary to the law;
it was the product of the Committee I
of One Hundred, an aggregation of job- j
chasers that had no excuse for its ex- j
Jstenee but Phelan's appointment. He i
is trying to square himself on that j
proposition by explaining that there is
no primary law under which he and
the Democrats could have proceeded.
Mr. Phelan is a lawyer and he knows
as well as any one knows that the Por
ter primary law is in full force and ef
iect, and that it affords voters and
parties full protection if they care to
â¢ it. It also provides severe pen
alties for those who transgress it.
"Another point that is counting
largely against Mr. Phelan is that he
has not the support of any one of the
reputable papers of this city. His sup
port is the Examiner and the Bulletin. 1
For me to stand here and argue to you
that the Examiner is not a reputable
paper wc-uld be an insult to your good
sense. As it is a well-known fact that
the Bulletin is out for whatever price
it can get there is also no need for me !
to give any attention to that quarter, j
These are the only papers in this city
that are lendins to Phelan any sup- j
port in his fight, and their support is
such that it would be shunned by any
Republican to whom it was offered."
Julius Kahn was next to speak. In a !
masterly manner he laid before his au
dlence the things that Mr. McKinley \
has accomplished in the last year; the !
height that the President has attained i
in the list of the world's statesmen. He
spoke of the necessity of retaining the
lands that this country has acquired
by the force of its arms and the justice
of its course in the late war. He
pointed out the many things that are
due this coast at the hands of the Gov
ernment and concluded with the argu
ment that only by electing a Congress
and a Senate in accord and sympathy
with the administration could they be
obtained and made the most of.
Following the speech of Mr. Kahn,
the Waterman sisters sang a number of
popular campaign songs. The applause
that rewarded them had scarcely quiet
ed when John Lenehan took the stand.
Mr. Lenehan was a Democratic repre
sentative in the Stale Senate in 1887,
and a stanch Democrat he has always
been until California Democracy lost
its identity. He stayed with it even
then, but when the party was turned
over to Maguire he gave up the at
tempt, and over since has stood for his
own belief and convictions. His con
victions are Republican, and he made
a rousing Republican speech last even-
I- er.
Ho opened with the broad statement
that if James D. Phelan was elected it
would be by the Republican vote. The
Democrats, he said, were solid against
him. With a knowledge of the man of
whom he spoke he held Mr. Phelan up
to the lim*> light of public opinion and
showed him, as he is, in his numerous
characters, to his hearers.
Mr. Patton got in late and his speech
was short. It consisted merely of a
pledge to subserve the best interests of
the peonie if he was elected. He was
received with the heartiest of greetings,
and lost nothing by his brevity.
William A. Deane. Judge Joachimsen,
T. H. Graham and Judge Low also
sroke, as did I. J. Trumaji and Asa
W>lls. The minor candidates were all
on hand, and icy wen all received
w the greatest enthusiasm.

MAGUIRE AN
APOSTLE OF
HENRY GEORGE
Kowalsky Condemns
Single Tax.
EVILS OF ITS ADOPTION
ELOQUENT ADDRESS DELIVERED
AT ODD FELLOWS' HALL.
James H. Barry Denounced as a
Henchman of Maguire's and an.
Advocate of His Doc
trines.
Odd Fellows' Hall was crowded to its
utmost capacity last evening by enthusi
astic Republicans from all parts of the
city, who assembled to hear the an
nounced address of Colonel Henry I.
Kowalsky on the issues of <the present
campaign.
After being introduced to the audience,
the attofney said: "The nomination of
James G. Maguire, the leading apostle of
the doctrine of Henry George, candidate
for Governor of California, has introduced
tlie Question of the destruction of private
property in land as an issue. The Demo
cratic party in Indorsing the man adopts I
this principle, because for many years I
Maguire has asserted and still asserts !
that it is the only remedy for industrial j
evils. Moreover, the Democratic party
openly commends the course of Maguire
in Congress, which has been spent almost
entirely in speeches and efforts to substi
tute the single tax on land In place of all
other taxes or tariffs. In addition to this,
Mr. Maguire, in a letter over his own
signature printed in the San Francisco I
Examiner May 6, ISS6, headed, 'The Next
Great Issue,' declares the single tax is
near at. hand, and in such letter says:
" 'Already the single taxers demand
that practical effort lie commenced imme
diately to force the issue into politics in
California.'
"Judge Magulre, in a speech before the
Single Tax Society in San Francisco on
September 6, 1891, published in the San
Francisco Call of September 7, 1891, esti
mates that under his system of single
tax, estimating the Federal Government
expenses as low as those of ISB6, viz.,
$242,483,138, the local tax rate would be at
least 4 per cent on all land upon the
assessed value, and according to his own
figures there made if based upon the
present expenditures of the Federal Gov
ernment the tax upon land under the sys
tem favored by him would be 5 per cent
or more, but he has repeatedly declared
that the whole rental value shall be taken
for taxes.
"Now, let me tell you. if Maguire was
as ambitious in a religious way as he is
politically ne would adopt about as many
religions as he has parties if he thought
he could get to heaven. I can see him
expecting a blessing -from Rev. Dr. Voor
sanger on a Saturday, and on a Sunday I
can see him beseeching Father Gallagher,
and when the moon is full I can see him
in a Chinese josshouse before the great
joss, licking the varnish off a fatted
pig so as to give evidence to the heathen
that he Is In full accord with them and
their ideas. I can see him gorging him
self with hog enough to keep an ordinary
Arctic explorer warm for six months.
Next. 1 can see him with his book
written on the Catholic church,
for which he ought to have two
covers, one of which to present
to the Catholic Irishman wno believes in
the Churoh of Rome, with a nleasing
preface, in order that he may hold him
as a friend, and the other cover merely
the reverse, which he can show to the
Irishman who doesn't believe in the
Church of Rome, but who is ready for a
fight on the 12th day of july. I say
again, if Mr. Maguire were as religiously
ambitious as he Is politically his amount

BROKE UP REPUBLICAN RALLY.
County Candidates Routed at Ala-
zneda by Organized Disturbers.
ALAMEDA, Oct. 27.â An organized at
tempt was made last nipht to break up
the Republican meeting at West End. ]t
is almost impossible to locate the perpe
trators of the offense, but they succeeded
in their efforts and stopped the speech-
making before half of the programme had
been carried out. Clarence Patton, a well
known character about the eastern end of
town, was used by the conspirators to
carry out their plans. He was togged out
regardless of style, and when the meeting
opened was seated on the stage with the
candidate?. He was a stranger to a West
End audience, and when during each in
termission there were cries of "Patton!
Pattort!" there were inquiries as to who
the individual was. It was whispered
about that he was an independent candi
date for City Marshal, who was backed
up by the younger element. As the calls
for Patton became more insistent the
chairman, all unconscious of the purpose,
introduced the young man to the audi
ence. Patton played his part well and
started to tell the crowd that he was a
candidate for Marshal, when his voice
waÃ lost in the cheers that came from
those who had put up the job. The noise
lasted for over ten minutes. The county
candidates left the hall In disgust, and
when the noise subsided Patton and his
friends were alone in the building.
REPUBLICANS AT OCEAN VIEW.
A Rousing Reception Tendered to
the State and City Nominees.
A most enthusiastic reception was ten
dered to the Republican nominees, both
State and municipal, by the residents of
Ocean View at Murphy's Hall last night.
A brass band and a huge brush bonfire
indicated the place of meeting as the
San Francisco and San Mateo electric
cars unloaded their human freight at the
doors of the hall.
H. E. Griffith, president of the Ocean
View Republican Club, had the honor of
presiding at the meeting. In addition to
the presence of the popular nominee for
Mayor, Charles L. Patton. and Henry S.
Martin, the next Sheriff, there were also
C S Laumeister, nominee for Railroad
Commissioner. C. F. Curry, nominee for
Secretary of State, was warmly greeted.
Mr. Pattnn reviewed the platform of
the Republican party and its nominees.
I J Truman, nominee for Treasurer, as
sured the people that they would
be fairly dealt with by the party. D. J.
Murphy, nominee for District Attorney,
followed. Thomas F. Graham, one of the
nominees for Police Judge met with a
very flattering reception and made a good
impression by his short and pointed
speech. Other speakers were A. B Tread
well, Judge Frank Kerrigan . H. N. Cle
ment. Judge C. A. Low Martin F Frag
ley G W. Collins and Henry S. Martin.
There Is But One E. L. Fitzgerald.
The votars of San Francisco who have
followed the exposures of The Call re
garding the record of Labor Commis
sioner E. L. Fitzgerald, the Democratic
candidate for Public Administrator,
should be careful not to confound the
name with that of Attorney General Wil
liam F. Fitzgerald, the Republican can
didate for the office of City and County
Attorney. The men are not relation:*
Attorney General Fitzgerald is an hon
orable gentleman, whose record as a pub
lic servant entitles him to the respect
and admiration of all good citizens.
A Mistake in Names.
In a report of the proceedings before
the Democratic Central Club published
In these columns yesterday Charles Eldel
man, one of the speakers, was reported
as making a humorous reference to a visit
be and "Tarpey" had made through the
district in search of votes. Instead of
"Tarpey" the name should have read
"Treacey," and in justice to all parties
concerned this correction is now made.
Enthusiastic Republicans.
The Republican Club of the Thirty
eighth District held a large and enthusi
astic meeting at its headquarters last
evening. Charles L. Patton, A. C. Ber
thier, John J. Conlon, Edward Aigeltlnger
P. A. Bergerot, W. H. Rlckard, Euward
Wolfe, J. R. McLean, "VVTlliam Roberts,
H. \V. Adams, Ed J. Sheehan and Sol
Shipper were the speakers of the evening.
United States Club.
One of the largest meetings of the |
present campaign was held in Pioneer i
Hall, corner Montgomery and Jackson i
streets, last evening, under the Auspices
of the United States Club. Intense en- '
thuslasm prevailed, showing that all the
speakers had the perfect sympathy of I
their auditors. Hiram S. Clark called the j
meeting to order, and after a few intro
ductory remarks he introduced Henry S.
Kelly *as the spt-aker of the evening.
Other speakers v.ere F. J. Widman, Fred
Ilinger and George V. Hartung.
Another Berthier Club.
A meeting was held last evening 1 at the
corner of Fourth and Mission streets for

GOOD REfIDiNG FOR VALENTINE.
AT a recent meeting of the National Association
of Freight Commissioners, held in Detroit,
much consideration was given to the attitude
of express companies toward the war tax. Criticism
upon such as refused, after a Wells-Fargo style, to
pay their share of the tax was general and severe.
The result of the deliberations was embodied in a
pamphlet which would make excellent reading for
President Valentine. If he has no copy he is wel
come to the loan oi a copy now in possession of The
Call.
Among reports read at the meeting were some
showing that certain express companies, notably
those of the South, had cheerfully complied with
legal enactments, had not striven to impose upon
their patrons, nor, attempting to misconstrue the law,
supported their contentions with Scripture quota
tions. Companies operating in Texas complied,
whether cheerfully or not matters little, since re
fusal to do so would have subjected the officials to
heavy fine. Here is an excerpt from a circular sent
out by the Railroad Commissioner of that State as a
warning:
"That any express company that requires the
shipper to pay for this stamp, in addition to the regu
lar tariff rates in force, is to that extent guilty of ex
tortion and liable to be prosecuted, and a penalty of
$500 for each offense collected of them."
Here is another, which was regarded as applicable:
"Every express company doing business in this
State which shall demand or receive a greater com
pensation than that which may be prescribed and
fixed by the said Railroad Commission for the trans
portation of any class or kind of property * * *
shall be deemed guilty of extortion and shall forfeit
and pay to the State of Texas a sum not to exceed
$500 for each offense."
Now California sustains a Board of Railroad Com
missioners. The Wells-Fargo Company is a common
carrier, and as such as directly within the jurisdic
tion of this body as the Texas companies are within
the jurisdiction of the one whose views and powers
have been cited. The Legislature also has a right to
participate in the regulation of a common carrier and
to force it to conduct itself honestly and decently, to
the elimination of comic Valentine methods.
The gentlemen at Detroit reached the decision that
the best method of protection against corporate greed
was the inauguration of a parcels post, but this is an
other subject.
PARETICS IN SPASMS.
SEVERAL paretics whose degeneracy has taken
the form of a desire to write are making a
feeble and babbling ado over an editorial para
graph in this paper. The paragraph in question con
gratulated Mrs. Botkin that she was not going to
Delaware to be tried, adding that a murder trial in
California was apt not to be a serious affair.
Thereupon arose a paretic, grasping a pen in his
red right hand, and said the paragraph had been writ
ten out of sympathy for the woman. Anybody with
intelligence acute enough to take a hint from the
tumbling of a house knew at a glance that the para
graph was a tribute to the laxity of justice when it
gets hold of a murderer. For the Botkin woman
there is not the least occasion for sympathy. If
guilty, hanging is too good for her.
But another scribe, impelled to rashness by the
softening of his brain or the absence of this useful
organ, declared that the attack upon the courts was
vile. He made the declaration in italics, and seemed to
feel real badly. Oh, well, possibly our courts are not
perfect. When three years are consumed in hang
ing a Durrant, when the slayer of a, police officer is
permitted to go free on evidence nobody doubted to
be perjury; when Mrs. Shattuck lures a man to her
house for the purpose of killing him, and does so
without excuse, afterward escaping punishment; when
a soldier kills his tent mate and is acquitted, there is
reason to think that a trial for murder is more serious
to the taxpayer than to anybody else. One woman in
recent years has been punished in San Francisco for
murder. She is now in San Quentin. She was a
silly creature, weak in body as in mind, moneyless,
friendless, not a dashing beauty. She had no in
fluence.
When there is such difficulty in convicting a mur
derer on the plainest evidence, while lawyers will
quibble so long as there is a fee in sight, it is surely
reasonable to suppose that in a case hedged about
with so many complications as the present one. the
trial will be long and, in all likelihood, ineffective.
Probably Mrs. Botkin would have found conditions
different in Delaware, She is to be congratulated;
the oublie isn't.
MAGUIRE ON PERSONALITIES.
JUDGE MAGUIRE has fallen to complaining
that his opponents have dealt in personalities.
He is> the last man who should make that com
plaint. As a rule a public man who himself avoids
j personalities toward others is exempt from them him
! self. But no public man in California has dealt in
more offensive personalities toward his opponents
than Judge Maguire. When he bolted the Demo
cratic ticket in 1886 he was rancorous and not decent
in his personal treatment. He called that gentlest of
gentlemen, Frank McCoppin, "a piece of carrion,"
when McCoppin's only offense was that he had re
ceived the regular Democratic nomination for Con
gress. In the same campaign he personally abused
Mr. Pond, against whom he was running Hinton, as
a bolter, for Mayor.
AY hen he sat down in his study to write his book
on "Ireland and the Pope" his abusive disposition
got the better of his discretion. Professing to write
truthfully on 800 years of history, stretching from
Pope Urban IV to Leo XIII, he displayed none of
the calm and judicial spirit which becomes the his
torian, but dealt in invective from start to finish. He
called the Pope "the serpent of the Vatican, sinking
his fangs in the heart of liberty." He called the car
dinals "red-capped hounds," and exhausted the vocab
ulary of abuse.
He betrays the same tendency in his discussion of
all public matters. In his copious speeches and
writings on the confiscation of land he continually
and with a wearisome and vituperative reiteration
calls the land-owner "a monopolist," a "cunning rob
ber," the "despoiler of God's children," an enemy of
"God's law," the "foe of society," who is to be pun
ished for investing in land by being "expelled" from
what he pretends to own. Vituperation and abuse,
personal detraction, the ascription to others of un
worthy motives, exude from him as naturally as red
sweat from a hippopotamus. In the present cam
paign he began with gross personal abuse of every
delegate to the Republican State Convention by call
ing them the tools and chattels of the Southern Pa
cific Railroad. He began personally decrying his op
ponent, Mr. Gage, by accusing him of bargaining
with the railroad for his nomination and intending,
if elected, to be the minion of that corporation in
stead of the servant of the people. No more gross,
abusive and insulting charge could be made against
a gentleman. But Maguire made it and has repeated
it. directly or by cowardly, unbecoming and unmanly
innuendo, in nearly every speech he has made.
Now what of the personal abuse of himself, of
which this venomously vituperative candidate com
plains? It consists solely of the publication of his
speeches and writings and holding him responsible
for what he has said himself, and for a fair and just
interpretation of it.
When he said that anarchists and nihilists were
worthy people and desirable immigrants whom he
hoped never to see excluded "from this land of the
free heart's hope and home," that utterance could
have but one meaning. It was an indorsement of the
anarchist and nihilist method and propaganda, and
the offer of an asylum in this country to the foes of
all government and the assassins of all who repre
sent law and order.
When he said that the land-owner had no right to
the land he had bought and "beautified and made fer
tile by his labor, but could be at any moment ex
pelled from it by its lawful owner, society," he de
clared for the communal confiscation of land without
compensation to the owner. If being "expelled" by
the commune is not confiscation, what is it? His
declaration was in form identical with Nicholas Ba
kounin's definition of anarchy â "Everything is every
body's."
It is no abuse of a man to hold him responsible
for what he says. If a man when a candidate for
office dodges responsibility for every public declara
tion he made before his nomination, but one conclu
sion can be formed concerning him â that he is a
mouthing fellow, so insincere that he will stand by
nothing that he says. If Judge Maguire would now
say from the stump: "Yes, I said the Pope is a ser
pent with poison fangs, and I stand by it. I said the
land-owner is a monopolist and a robber of God's
children, who can be justly expelled from his land
without compensation, though it may be a hardship
to him, and I stand by it," everybody would respect
his adherence to those expressions of his belief,
though the belief would be odious to a majority of
men.
If Maguire choose to treat his record as a dog does
the tin kettle tied to his tail and try to run away from
it, it is no personal abuse to call attention to the
kettle. â 
fl ONE-SIDED COMPOIGN.
ONE of the most striking and significant fea
tures of this campaign is the contrast in the
strength presented by the opposing parties on
the stump. It is a condition never before seen in
California in this generation. On the Republican
side is a host of orators of the highest eminence in
politics and in professional life, and on the other is
one stump speaker of note â Maguire howling in the
wilderness alone and forsaken.
The weakness of the Democratic campaign in this
respect is remarkable, for however that party may
lack for statesmen, it has never before lacked for
orators of considerable ability. At the present time
it has in its ranks many speakers who if they took
the stump would attract large audiences, but they are
silent in this fight. They refuse to be eloquent or
even to be loquacious for fusion, single tax, anarchy
and Maguireism.
The Democratic masses in this campaign look in
vain for the old leaders, listen in vain for the voices
of the old orators. English, Foote, Geary, Irish,
Caminetti, Reddy, Clunie and many another of local
fame and note â where are they?
There is surely some significance in this silence on
the part of the noted leaders of California Democracy.
Men who have been identified with a party through
out their political career â politicians whose fortunes
are bound up with the success of the party â do not
forsake it for nothing. Maguireism has struck old
Democracy a hard blowâ it has knocked it speechless.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 28, 1898.
ONE of the most barefaced tricks of the cam
paign is that which has been perpetrated by
the circulation of a so-calied "regular teach
ers' ticket" of candidates for School Directors. While
the trick has been carried out with some slyness in
an underhand way, it is not difficult to decide as to
its authorship. It carries on its face unmistakable
marks of its origin.
The ticket puts up something of a pretense to be
non-partisan in its nature, for it includes Republicans
as well as Democrats among its candidates. The pre
tense, however, is but a thin one, for there are but
four Republicans to eight Democrats. Such a
ticket, it will be seen, would give the Democrats com
plete control of the Board of Education by a two
thirds vote. It is clearly one of those tricks which,
if successful, would prove to be a snap for the work
ers of it.
That there may be no mistake in the matter we
give the names on the ticket. They appear without
any statement of the political affiliations of the can
didates, but the letters giving the initials of the
party to which each candidate belongs are added in
order that the public may understand the nature of
the scheme. The list is as follows:
William A. Kemp (R.), D. F. Keefe (D.), T. J.
Lyons (D.), J. M. Thomas (R.), Benjamin Armer
(D.), George R. Armstrong (R.), H. W. Branden
stein (D.), A. A. Cavagnaro (D.), J. J. Conlon (R.),
Dr. P. J. Conran (D.), William M. Cannon (D.), and
Charles P. Eells (D.).
A copy of the ticket has been sent to nearly every
public school teacher in the city with the request
that it be supported in the coming election. Several
of the tickets sent out were accompanied by remarks
giving the impression that they emanated from the
office of the clerk of the Board of Education, but this
it appears was a part of the trick.
The fraud, though cunning in design, was too
clumsy in execution to succeed. The teachers who
received the ticket were surprised and began at once
to make inquiries at the office of the board for an
explanation. It was then found that the thing was a
trick. The teachers not only have had nothing to do
with it, but they distinctly repudiate it. The whole
scheme was clearly an attempt to make use of the
teachers to elect a Democratic majority of the board.
We will leave the eight Democrats who would have
profited by the success of the trick to explain the
thing to their colleagues on the Democratic ticket
who were left out of the circular, and before the ex
planations are over it will probably be found by the
authors that the trick is a roorback.
The only way to provide for a good Board of Edu
cation and to assure the right administration of our
schools is to vote for the straight Republican ticket.
Every candidate for the board was selected by the
Republican convention solely because of his personal
fitness for the place They resort to no tricks nor
frauds in making the canvass. They stand for hon
esty in the campaign and in office.
SECOND CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT.
Iâ\EPUBLICANS1 â \EPUBLICANS of the Second Congressional
lâv' District have an opportunity of' rectifying the
* * mistake of two years ago and sending to the
House of Representatives a stanch upholder of the
administration in place of the Democrat whom they
elected at that time. It is an opportunity which no
loyal member of the party can afford to neglect. The
issue is far-reaching. It appeals to patriotism as well
as to local interests and popular welfare.
Grave problems of foreign as well as of domestic
politics will confront the administration during the
term of the Congress that is to be elected this fall. It
is for the voters to determine whether the President,
when he meets those issues, shah have the support
of a House of Representatives friendly to his policies
and willing to support him in loyalty, or a House
dominated by a majority antagonistic to the Presi
dent and more desirous of hindering than of aiding
him to make his administration a success and a benefit
to the nation.
All the questions now before the people in the
arena of national politics are summed up in the one
great issue of supporting the administration. Every
candidate for Congress is either for the President or
against him. It is for the voters to determine whether
they will be represented at Washington for the next
two years by a friend of the administration or an
opponent.
Foreign nations are waiting to see what Americans
will do in this crisis. The elections are to show
whether our people are changeable and fickle, or
whether they will stand by their Government until the
questions growing out of the war are settled and the
old issues of tariff and finance closed for this genera
tion.
To lead them in the contest the Republicans of the
Second District have a young and vigorous cham
pion. Frank D. Ryan is one of the most noted of
the Native Sons of the State. He has long been
prominent in public life, and holds a high rank at
the bar. As District Attorney of Sacramento he has
made a record which attests at once his ability as a
lawyer and his fidelity to the public service, nor can
it be doubted that in the wider field of Congressional
activity he will show an equal efficiency, integrity and
zeal.
With such a candidate to represent the administra
tion and with such issues at stake, there ought to be
no question as to what the voters of the Second Dis
trict will do on election day. The Democrats are
making a still hunt and fighting hard for every seat
in sight. Republicans cannot afford to be indifferent
or over-confident at any point of the contest.
"Stand by the President" should be the motto of the
canvass from this time on.
People of Connecticut are angry because no battle
ship has been named after their State. Yet here is Cal
ifornia, where the best battleships the world knows
are turned out as easily as Connecticut ever made
nutmegs, not getting its name attached to so much as
a converted tug, and not raising a row about it,
either.
By the opportunity afforded through murders com
mitted by Patrick Keenan and Patrick O'Shea the
courts will be able to demonstrate the speed with
which two cold-blooded assassins, concerning whose
guilt there is no shadow of doubt, can be dropped
about six feet.
People who witnessed the drowning of a team
ster at the Jackson-street wharf seemed to be stirred
by the spectacle, but there never came to them the
conviction that to rescue a man from drowning is
considered not only proper but laudable.

A ROORBACK TICKET.
THE WOODEN HORSE
To the Editor of The Call: The power of the people may be used
against the people. This is a proposition that plain people, must always
keep in mind. This government was made for the plain people, for you and
for me, and not for the politicians. The men who made the government
took all pains to prevent the politician getting so much power that he
might be dangerous to us. For that reason they divided political power
among many officials; they took care that every few years those officials
should return their power to the people and they cultivated the growth of
gieat political parties so that the people might have the power of choice.
The boss tries to get around these devices first by controlling as many
of the officials ac possible, secondly by nominating for office those that
will serve Mm, and thirdly by seizing the party machinery so that no other
leader may have an opportunity to come to the surface. This is Mr. Phe
lan's method. Other bosses have tried it, but none have brought it to such
perfection as he. Some have controlled conventions, some have mastered
Supervisors, some have been able to reach the judiciary, some have owned
the Sheriff or the County Clerk, but never in this city has there been a
man strong enough to own convention, Supervisors, School Board, Sheriff,
County Clerk, Assessor, Auditor, the judiciary, in a word everything ex
cept the Morgue. This is now Mr. Phelan's aim. To reach this end he ap
peals to the plain peopleâ to you and to me. He asks for your vote and
my vote to attain his ambition.
IN THE AMERICAN SYSTEM
There is only one legitimate way for obtaining elective office, and that is
by obtaining the most votes. But Mr. Phelan is not satisfied with that way.
In the first place, it is too uncertain and Mr. Phelan is not taking chances.
In the second place it does not make Mr. Phelan the sole source of power.
Of course he cannot entirely dispense with our votes, but we may learn
his desire and his inclinations where he thinks he can do without us.
Honesty may be put to many dishonest purposes. There was never a vir
tue yet that did not have its counterfeit presentment. Political honesty
is such a taking cry that it is no wonder that pretenders have made the
most of it. For a long time the plain people â you and I â have had our eye
on the professional honest politicians. One of the very peculiar facts con
nected with our local politics is that there have always been three honest
men- in our Boards of Supervisors. This is as constant as a natural law.
It has held so long that the memory of man runneth not to the contrary.
Mathematics and honesty have no connection as far as is known to our
philosophy. Why, therefore, there should be three and only three cannot
be explained by any inherent property of this virtue of honesty in gen
eral, or of political honesty in particular. Of course we know that if out
of twelve men only nine can fit in a room the other three must remain out
side the door. The three outsiders may explain their position by whatever
virtue they please â honesty, temperance, fortitude, magnanimity or fear of
the Lordâ any old virtue will do. But the plain citizen will have his own
explanation and his explanation will be based on the physical fact that a
room that can hold only nine does not need more than nine to make it full.
HENCE THE THREE HONEST MEN
Who appear with painful monotony In every Board of Supervisors are re
garded with suspicious interest by the plain citizenâ by you and by me.
We listen to their thunderous indignation as they denounce the solid nine
that have broken into some treasury or another. We take in their pas
sionate protestations that they have never cast a sidelong eye on a treas
ury â their thoughts are as virgin of treasuries as the colored person's of
fiction are of hen roosts. We smile when we hear them describe the in
famy of combines, for we are not so old that we have forgotten our child
hood's fable of the fox who gave his opinion of sour grapes.
In the present Board of Supervisors there were three painfully honest
menâ Mr. Dodge, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Lackmann. Their honesty has for
now two years reverberated between the Twin Peaks and Goat Island.
There is no one in this city ignorant of their virtues, for have they not
sat in a row in the public places like Justice with a patch on their eyes
and unlike Justice with a placard on their bosoms bearing the legend, "I
am blind, but honest"?
The chief characteristic of these three Supervisors during the past two
years, besides their honesty, has been
THEIR DEVOTION TO MR. PHELAN.
They were men who would support his policy. Two were Democrats and
one was Republican but they were all of the Phelan party. Whatever he
wanted they did, and without him they did nothing.
In the new Jerusalem which Mr. Phelan intends to let down upon this
peninsula from the heaven of his own honesty three such faithful servi
tors should have a high place. One might sit at his right hand and the
other on his left and the third would be convenient as the footstool of his
feet. Such services as theirs deserved a reward, and a reward that was
sure.
Of course the people are in theory the last judges of honesty. They
often in elections are rendered distrustful of professions that grow too
loud. It is possible that they might not take the three honest men at
their words. They might think it quite possible that the next time the
room that only holds nine was empty these three men might by mistake
wander inâ for are they not blind? But Mr. Phelan does not believe in
trusting the people any more than he can help. He knew a way to re
ward his servants with a sure reward.
When a member of one party Is dissatisfied with the party's candidates
he always has the recourse of voting the ticket of the other party. This
is one of the advantages of the existence of parties.
NO PARTY CAN AFFORD TO IGNORE THE PLAIN CITIZEN
Entirelyâ you and I can take our revenge by supporting the least obstrep
erous organization. But this recourse is taken away from us altogether
if both parties nominate the same Gandidates. We can do nothing then
but submit.
This was Mr. Phelan's brilliant scheme for rewarding those who had
served him well. He would put them on both tickets. No matter hov>
they had conducted themselves on other matters, the people could not re
buke them. They had been his faithful servants and this virtue covered
all other sins. They might have neglected their constituents, betrayed
their principles, flown in the face of justice, but the people could not
reach them. They were
SAFE WITHIN THE AWFUL SHADOW OF THE PLUG HAT.
Against them none dare lift a hand. With the Republican, Mr. Lackmann
the scheme succeeded. He was nominated by the Republican convention
and by the committee of one hundred. The committee of one hundred
claims to be the Democratic party of San Francisco. If it has any reason
for existence it is to nominate Democrats to office. If it does not nomi
nate Democrats it should go out of business and become a non-partisan
party or something else. Plain people like you and me may sometimes
fail to see the use of bringing national party names into municipal affairs
But as long as they are brought in, because we are plain people, we wish
to see them plainly and honestly used. A Democratic convention that
nominates Republicans is a mockery, a delusion and a snare.
But you and I see clearly enough that the virtues to which the commit
tee of one hundred looked were not the virtues known as Democracy, but
subserviency to Mr. Phelan. His cry has been, "Give me men that' will
support my policy." He does not care whether they are Republicans or
Democrats as long as they do his will. When we hire servants we don't
ask their politics. Sufficient for us that they obey.
So the committee of one hundred nominated Mr. Laokmann and Mr
Lackmann has received his reward. He can sit in peace under his own vine
and fig tree and wait for November 8. No matter how many enemies he
has, the people cannot defeat him. He goes on the board not as the repre
sentative of the people but as the representative of James D. Phelan.
Mr. Phelan tried the same tactics with Mr. Clinton. Mr. Clinton is a
Democrat, and the process was not so easy as in the case of Mr. Lackmann
Mr. Phelan, who poses as the apostle of purity, whose campaign Is a con
tinued cry against the terrible evil of having bosses other than himself an"
proaches the Kelly and Crimmins outfit with the proposition to nominate
Mr. Clinton on the Republican ticket. But whether Kelly and Crimmins
could not deliver the goods, or whether the scheme was too scandalous for
them, the deal was not consummated. But. Mr. Phelan's object was the
same. No matter how many valid and serious objections might be against
Mr. Clinton, he tried to force him upon the voters of this city because of
his obedience to himself.
The plain citzen, that is you and I, may learn from this how far Mr
Phelan is prepared to go. Here we have no ordinary boss; we have a man of
talent, of wealth, of ingenuity, striving to control the whole city Why \<*
he making such efforts? To give us a good government, he say's When
the wooden horse lay outside the walls of Troy the Phelan of that'dav de
clared that if it were brought within the city the wicked Greeks could
never again molest the Trojans' peace. A plain man, like you and I sairt
"I am afraid of the Greeks even when they bring us good gifts " The nlaln
man was right. The wooden horse was filled with armed men It 'was brought
into, the town, and soon the town was but a name. Even now- nlain twT
pie, like you and me, say, "We are afraid of a boss even when he brin-i, â=
good government." Yours truly, a PLAIN CITIZEN

FATHER CARAHER
ANSWERS FATHER OTIS,,
DISAGBEES WITH THE REV
EREND GENTLEMAN.
Commends the Decisive Action of the
Police in Closing More Dens
of Vice Yesterday.
Father Caraher of St. Francis Church
has submitted the following reply to the
letter from Father Otis, published in yes
terday's Call:
Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir: In to-day's
issue of your journal 1 am once more as-
Bailed for the stand I have taken against
a dire evil and for my defense of thousands
of children and adults. The two letters of
my censor are remarkable only for mis
representation, passion and reckless asser
tions. In the second letter he does not, as
in the first, suggest that I change my
residence in certain circumstances, for he
knows, or should know, that I have no
rural abode, and that in no case could I
think of scampering to an Eastern nome.
This diocese is mine by adoption; here I
have labored, however feebly and unfruit
fully, for twenty-five years, and here I in
tend to end my days.
The appeal to St. Paul's -writings to sub
stantiate the fearful doctrine that the
abominations of Sodom and Gomorrah are
"kindred" crimes to buying and selling in
the temple is, to say the least, unjust to
the great apostle. St. Paul merely men
tions the sinners that shall be excluded
from heaven if they die in these specific
sins, but neither he nor any theologian
dare teach that buying and selling are
"kindred" or cognate to these abomina
tions.
Time and again my self-appointed censor
strives to make me use the word "localize,
which I have studiously avoided. I have
said that "It is my belief that filth should
be impounded and compressed instead of
diffused," and I think that any sane man
will admit the correctness of this belief.
When a building or locality is invaded by
smallpox it is quarantined, and there is
neither ingress nor egress, lest the con
tagion spread. In the case under considera
tion the evil was being rapidly diffused,
the diffusion had already reached, and
threatened to ruin, this section of the city,
and the diffusers cannot now escape from
their criminal part in the work.
My censor asks me to furnish him with
the proofs in my possession that a move
ment was on foot to dump the filth or his
locality at our doors, and offers me valuable
assistance against any such future move
ment. What effrontery, to ask me to sup
ply him with proofs! An effrontery only
equaled by his indiscretion in starting a
controversy. As to his assistance in the
future, I disdain to receive any from such
a source. Nevertheless, these proofs are in
my possession, and I am ready to present
them when the demand comes from the
proper quarter.
In writing of the destruction of Sodom
and Gomorrah I stated I was far from sug
gesting fire and sword as a remedy for the
present evil, much though I desire to see
it extinguished, but my censor leads us to
believe that he would use fire. "We cannot
say that we indorse his disapproval of the
means employed by God," etc. This language
could be easily construed to imply a threat
to burn property, if not persons, and the
man who uses it might be easily connected
with future conflagrations. Not <~,nly would
I not burn nor kill any of these unfortonate
women but I am ready to provide a home
for any one in my parish that shows signs
of repentance. I am ready to receive any
of these pitiable outcasts as our Lord re
ceived the Magdalene and as my predeces
sors in the priesthood received Mary of
Egypt and Margaret of Cortona. They are
all made to the image and likeness of God.
That image and likeness, though dis
figured, still remain, and from their
fallen state they may be raised to the glory
of heaven.
The writer most unfairly separates the word
"impounded" from the word "compressed,'
whereas I had closely connected them, and
in contradistinction to the term "diffused."
Not once did I declare the impounding of the
evil a necessity, yet the writer harps upon
Us necessity, and in this relation makes a
distasteful allusion to "our monasteries and
convents." The impression is disingenu
ously sought to be conveyed that I an: â¢ â !">
posed to the enforcement of the law in the
case under consideration, but it is my deter
mination to enforce the law that has lately
moved Chief Lees to act so sweepingly in
this neighborhood. The Chief has done more
in the last twenty-four hours than I ex
pected from him in six months.
The singling me out from all the Inhabi
tants of the city as the one cognizant of the
disreputable dens in the writer's nelghb< r
hood and as the competent witness to appear
before Chief Lees Is too ridiculous to notice,
and the sudden change from "coercing" to
"cajoling" the Supervisors is most laugh
able. I have full confidence in the gentle
men of the board. I believe that they are
disposed to do Justice to all. and that they
are superior to threats and cajolery.

SEA KING TO THF RESCUE
CAPTAIN GRITFITHS OF THE
ALBERT REBUKED.
Started to Land His Honolulu Pas

His Vessel.
The Golden Gate was crowded with ar
riving- and departing wsseN last Wednes
day night and yesterday. Many of them

British ship Both well, L4B days from New

British ship Eurasia, 139 days from Ant

frotn HUo; Norwegian ship Hiawatha, i 52
viays from l,eith; bark Albert, 18 days,
and barkentine Addenda, 20 days from
Honolulu.
All these vesels came up the coast with
a good fair wind, but when they got off
the Golden Gate the wind fell light, and
they could make no progress. The Ad
denda attempted to sail In, but when she
grot between the heads the wii.u failed
and she began to drift. Captain Delano
was afraid bis vessel might go ashore, so
he tame 10 an anchor. In a short time
the tut; Soa King came along and towetl
him to a safer berth.
Captain Griffiths of the bark Albert got
Into trouble with the State Quarantine
Officer. While the Governor Perkins was
putting Dr. Hill aboard the Addenda Cap
tain Milestone noticed. that Captain Grif
fiths and three of his passengers were
going ashore from the Albert. He at
once gave chase and overhauled, the Al
bert's boat before she reached Powell
street wharf. The boat and passengers
were taken back to the Albert and were
told to remain there until the Quaranti*!
Officer had passed the vessel. For this
breach of the law Captain .Griffiths could
have been arrested and heavily fined, out:
the doctor did not press the matter wnen
the captain explained that he acted in
ignorance of the law.

The Harbor Commissioners had a lively ,
session yesterday. Commissioner Herold
started the ball rolling by moving that
two berths at Folsom street wharf be
assigned to the Alaska Packers 1 Associa- j
tion and one to the Alaska Commercial ,
Company. This Mr. Colnon objected to
on the ground that Folsom street wharf
had been built expressly for the Oceanic â 
Steamship Company, and that concern |
should be compelled to use it. Both Her
rold and Harney pointed out that the
commission was appointed to improve
and look after the shipping interests of ,
the port. The very best facilities should I
be given large companies, and if one :
wharf was better adapted to ocean trade
than another the ship owner should have
the choice. The Oceanic Steamship Com
pany found Pacific street wharf more j
suitable than Folsom street wharf and j
wanted to remain there. Other equally
large shipping concerns wanted space at
Folsom street and the board could please
everybody by granting the request of the
Alaska Packers' and Alaska Commercial
companies. The motion was carried. Then
Mr Colnon wanted the rent of Pacific
street wharf increased, and the matter |
was laid over for further consideration.

that the trouble was all caused by
grain dealers falling to remove their
wheat from the grain sheds in the regu

passed a resolution by which all owners
will have to pay 10 cents a ton a day for

ports that when out about six weeks the

It was carefully watched for a couple
of weeks, when it became hotter and a
large portion of it had to be thrown over

shortly before the arrival here. On

heavy sea which knocked the life boats
loose and broke the compass on the

being much damaged.
DEANE AGAIN ON THE STAND
Gives More Details of the Looting of
the Nevada Bank.
Becker and Creegan, notwithstanding
the fact that a strong and clever fight is
being waged to secure them freedom,
looked worried yesterday as Deane, their
accomplice, continued his story of the
methods used to swindle the Nevada
Bank out of $22,000. Deane has not for
gotten even the most trifling incident of
the steal, and the jury now knows all the
facts of the celebrated forgers'. It rests
with the prosecution simply to produce
sufficient corroborative evidence, and the
forgers stand an excellent chance of be
ing placed out of harm's way for the
remainder of their lives.
Deane closed his testimony on direct ex
amination about 3 yesterday afternoon
and was given into the hands of Attorney
II 1 ' ter Dunne for cross-examination. The
cross examination of the witness will
bly occupy the entire session of
court to-day and to-morrow. The prose

LABORERS WANT THEIR WAGES
Efforts Made to Protect Men of the
Atlas Iron Works.
A short time ago the laborers employed
in the Atlas Iron Works of this city made
application to the State Labor Bureau to
assist them in collecting $"2100 which was
due them for services and which the com
pany failed to produce. A meeting was
called by the Board of Trade last Tues
day at which Patrick Noble, president,
and George Townly, secretary of the
works, were present and they agreed to
turn over to the men book accounts to
the value of $2^09. Until this time they
have neglected to keep their agreement.
The laborers now, fearing that the com
pany will make an attempt to collect the
accounts themselves to-day, have signed
over their claims to Labor Commissioner
Fitzgerald, and he will request those par
ti. ?â¢ whose names are attached to the
accounts to defer payment until matters
can be adjusted in a manner which will
protect the men from the loss of their
daily wage. No written agreement was
made, and it is not known whether the
law could force the return of the amount
collected on the book accounts should
it once pass into the company's hands.
The liabilities of the firm are $6900, and
its assets $2309.
The Botkin Case.

THE SAN FBAyCTSCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 2S, 1898.
HAVE TAKEN
THE TEACHERS'
NAME 111 YMI
Democratic Trick to
Control the Schools.
REGULAR TEACHERS' TICKET
A FATHERLESS CHILD IN THE
FIELD OF POLITICS.
No One Was Consulted on the Scheme
and No One Knows Who
Is Responsible
for It.
In an effort to grab all in sight the
; Democratic faction has turned conslder
| able attention to the School Board. It
has flooded the town with a ticket of
; School Directors, containing just a suffl
| cient number of Republicans to give it a
i non-partisan appearance, and it has made
; an unwarranted use of the names of the
j teachers to give it respectability and to
help it along.
It is a fatherless child in the field of
> politics. No one knows from where it
came nor who is responsible for its be
ing. It is in the field and that Is all
i any one knows about it. The name of
j the office where it was printed Is mlss
' ing. It is an anonymous communication
I to any one whose memory of school days
i is green enough to induce him to over
j look the lack of parentage. It is an
! old trick, and ie its own undoing.
The ticket is indorsed "Regular Teach
ers' Ticket." It is not the regular teach
ers' ticket. The teachers declare, some
openly and others in secret, that there
is no "regular teachers' ticket," and the
one so labeled is the same kind of a
political trick as appears at every elec
tion.
The teachers deny that they are in, poli
tics, as the ticket heading would lead peo
ple to infer, nor have any of them been
consulted in its formulation. To correct,
therefore, the impression conveyed by the
unwarranted use of their name, the fol
lowing protest has been circulated and
generally signed:
We, the undersigned, hereby protest against
a ticket being largely circulated among the
voters of the city and county of San Francisco.
Said ticket is headed "Regular Teachers'
Ticket," and contains the namea of twelve
men selected from the different municipal tick
ets. The teachers have not Issued and do not
countenance any such document. Respectfully
submitted,

teachers, and there are many more who
refused to sign through fear of the con-

DEMOCRATS OF SAN
JOSE HEAR WHITE
Senator Ridicules the Single Tax,
But Declares It Is Not
an Issue.
SAN JOSE. Oct. 27.â Senator Stephen.
M. White addressed a large audience at
the Auditorium this evening. B. D. Mur
phy acted as chairman. J. L. Dryden,
fusion nominee for Railroad Commission
er, opened the speaking. He adhered to
the railroad question and accused the Re
publican party of representing railroad
corporations. Judge W. M. Conley, can
didate for Supreme Judge, followed with
a few remarks.
Senator White was then introduced. He
prefaced his remarks by saying he would
engage in no personalities. He knew
Gage personally and Maguire from boy
hood. Honesty and experience were nec
essary for the conduct of government,
and Maguire possessed both these virtues,
especially the former. The "Little Giant"
understood political affairs. His career in
the Legislature had been honorable, and
he made a good Judge. He had fully dis
charged his duty as Congressman. White
ridiculed the single tax proposition and
said it was not an issue. The railroads
were mentioned, but no reference was
made to the funding bill. The Southern
Pacific, he said, wished mightily that the
entire Republican ticket be elected, and
was working hard for it night and d;iy.
The speaker said the war revenue came
out of the people's pockets instead of
those of the corporations, and that work
ingmen who used beer and tobacco bore
the brunt of it. He denied that the Re
publlcanÃ should have the glory of the
war and said that Populists and Demo
crats also had taken part in it. He closed
with words of praise for the soldiers and
sailors who had participated in the war.

Those Who Still Hold Out of the
Combination May Join Any
Time Until January

Several weeks apo the stockholders
of the San Francisco and San Joaquin
Valley Railroad were invited to turn
their stock over to the trustees, accept
ing in return a guarantee that, if before
January 1, 1899, the combination had
proved successful, the shares they turned
in at fJO should be paid for at par, or $100
per share.
Most of the stockholders accepted thi3
Invitation at once, and a large percentage
of the capital stock was placed in escrow
with the Tnion Trust Company. The
Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway
Company having determined to take up
this option, for the purpose of getting a

petition with the Southern Pacific, Rob
ert Watt, first vice president of the Val

who had not yet come into the combina

"ST. NICHOLAS OR YOUR LIFE I"
ST. NICHOLAS
FOR YOUNG FOLKS.
Edited by Mary Mapes Dodge.
BEGINNING THE TWENTY-SIXTH YEAR.
DERHAPS you used* to read ST. Nicholas in its early days. Do
JT you remember how you enjoyed it, how you looked forward with
eagerness to the day of issue? Twenty-five years have gone by since
the first number appeared in November, 1873, but the magazine is to-
day just what it was then, â
The Best Periodical in the World for Girls and Boys.
It has the same editor, Mary Mapes Dodge, and the same policy,â
to get the best things in literature and art that money can buy and
young folks will enjoy and thrive under.
Young people to-day like to read the Henty books, â so Mr. Henty
has written for them a story of American history which will appear as a
serial in St. Nicholas for the coming year; and.Mrs. Amelia E. Barr,
author of " Jan Vedder's Wife," will furnish a historical romance of Old
New York and Mrs. Laura E. Richards will contribute a serial; and
there are to be good things from many writers, â Mrs. Burton Harrison,
Lieut- Robert E. Peary, Lloyd Osbourne, Mrs. Charles D. Sigsbee,
(the wife of the Maine's commander). Poultney Bigelow, and others.
Gelett Burgess is to contribute a series of remarkable pictures and verse
about the " Goop Babies." Every number of St. Nicholas will be as
good as can be made.
Keep in mind the fact that the young people of to-day are just as
anxious to read ST. NICHOLAS as you used to be, â and how many of
them can you subscribe for and make happy?
The price is $j.oo a year, and the year begins with November, an especially
beautiful birthday issue. December is the Christmas Number. All dealers or
the publishers take subscriptions.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Oct. 27.â The stock market
showed a continuation of yesterday's strength
to-day, and the speculative activity broadened
out considerably in addition. There was not
quite such a congestion of trading in Tobacco
and Sugar, although these stocks were the
leaders in point of activity. They were traded
in nearly all day at a level below yesterday's
rinse, though each stock advanced slightly
above yesterday's price for a brief interval.
Sugar left off with a decline of 3>i from the
highest and a loss of 1% from yesterday. To
bacco was under pressure from the supposition
that the recently incorporated company is des
tined to be a powerful c â etitor, and on de
nials ot" accessions to the American Company
of outside plug tobacco companies. The stock
was at one time off 2%, but closed with a small
net gain. In industrials, the hesitation on foreign
exchanges was without "effect. There was a
large demand for quite a number of railroad
stocks, the Grangers leading, with pretty much
all the Western and Southern roads showing a
good tone. The Eastern trunk lines continued
to lag on account of the admittedly bad rate
situation in that territory which nullified the
benefit of the exceptionally large tonnage which
is being moved. St. Paul was the leader in
the railway list, and the movement of the stock
â was supposed to foreshadow a good September
statement due to-morrow.
The gross increase of that period in earnings
is known to be well on toward $600,000. and it
Is surmised that the statement will show a re
du- f 'C>n In the recent heavy fates of expendi
tures for improvements charged to operating
expenses. The September statement of the
Union Pacific, while showing p decrease of over
$44,000 in gross earnings, showed operating ex
penses so largely reduced as to leave an ln
fn surplus earnings of $112, 554. The de
layed movement of cotton now coming for
ward and the decrease of yellow fever fore
shadow good earnings for Southern and South
western railroads. The easier tone to-day of
Sterling Exchange was the direct result of the
cal .er feeling in Paris. There was a heavy de
mand for Sterling Exchange here yesterday for
Piiris account, which sprang from the same
cause as that which lifted exchange on Lon
don in Paris above the gold export point, name
ly, the nressure to transfer funds from Paris
to London. It is now known also that the
violent recovery In British consols was partly
due to buying for account of timid Paris capi
tal because of the domestic disquiet, and not al
together to the relief of the Anglo-French ten-
Fion over Fashoda. There was a good absorp
tion of railroad bonds to-day, and prices are
generally higher. Total sales, $3.4*0,000.
United States new fours coupon declined %;

THE LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. Oct. 27. -.The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says:
The cheerful tone in the stock markets here
at the close yesterday was maintained to-day.
The rise was most marked in Americans and
In Kaffirs, the former closing quiet, at the
best chiefly on New York support. The one
small failure at the settlement to-day Is of no
significance, but the recovery in prices Is time-
Iv, as there are some weak spots.
* Consols closed under the best, and should

The very sharp drop in Paris exchange to-day

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Oct. 27.â Wheat started tame and
in the early part of the day had nothing to
stir it into more than moderate activity. How
ever the firmness of the cash markets in the
Northwest and a recovery at Liverpool re
sulting in Ud advance for the day Imbued the
crowd here with a desire for the buying side.
TheT accordingly pursued a bull policy during
the forenoon, but in a conservative way taking
moderate quantities on the soft spots. Eng
lish consols opened 5-16 higher and made a fur
ther Vi per cent advance, retaining all of it
at the close. This peaceful Indication about
balanced smaller domestic receipts and the
closing firmness of the Liverpool market. The
bulls weakened near the end and bears per
sisted in selling on all hard spots. December
left off at %'S 1 /ic decline on the day.
Late receipts and continued complaints of the
poor condition resulting from the recent damp
weather strengthened corn. Prices showed a
good advance the greater part of the day, but
near jihe end weakness developed in sympathy
with wheat and th? advance was nearly all
lost December closing with a gain of %c.
Oats were quiet, prices being sustained by the
Etrencth in corn and a good cash demand.
May closed unchanged.
The heavy run of hogs was a depressing fea
ture in provisions and more than balanced the
excellence of the demand. The market ruled
dull throughout and the tendency of prices
again was slightly downward. Pork closed
71..-.C lower, lard lost 5c and ribs 7V4c lower.

CALIFORNIA RAISINS IN NEW . YORK.
NEW Y*ORK. Oct. 27.â The Journal of Com
merce under this date says: The situation in
the market for California raisins Is very unsat-
isfactoryto packers' and commission merchants'
jobbers. The first named are unable because
of poor drying weather to deliver goods con
tracted for on time, and consequently -the as
sociation rules will have to stand the difference
between prices prevailing prior to October 15
and those which went into force on that date.
Delay in deliveries has been the cause of con
siderable embarrassment to commission mer-:
chants at this end. They have been unable
to fully make good their contracts with job
bers, and the latter, who need goods very
much, are dissatisfied and uncertain as to the
future. While goods contracted for are being 1
delayed some buyers are obliged to go into the
market and make purchases in order to
promply meet the requirements of their trade.
The demand for California raisins has not been
more than a third of the average since the
season opened. No raisins are reported to have
been sold to Eastern markets, at least not
east of the Allefrhanies, ;.t prices which took
effect on October 15. but trade In this section
seems to very much want to know why de
liveries on contracts maile prior to that date
have not been made as fully as was expected
they would be.
Eastern handlers of raisins generally are of
the opinion that consolidation of the California
industry would be a good thing. for everybody
concerned, and are disposed to make every al
lowance for hitches In carrying out what they
concede Is an experiment, but are Inclined to
be severe in criticisms of the management of
the business as conducted by the present asso
ciation.

bought sparingly. The home trade took the
bulk of the offerings after it was seen that

named. The unsettled wool market has a de

THE STOCK MARKET.
Prices for mining stocks were lower again,
with a corresponding decrease in sales.
Local securities were more active, and prices
were rather irregular, though there were no
variations worthy of note.
An exchange says: "The Anaconda Copper
Mining Company of Montana has declared a
dividend of $1 25 per share, payable November
1. The total amount of the dividend is $1,500,
000 on 1,200,000 shares of capital stock. The
last previous dividend was paid in May and
was of the same amount. The total of $1,500,000
is the largest dividend now being paid by any
mining company in the United States. The
total dividends paid by the Anaconda to date
amount to $8, 250,000."
The Pacific Lighting Company has declared
the usually monthly dividend of 40 cents per
share, payable November 5.
The Alaska-Treadwell Gold Mining Com
pany will pay a regular quarterly dividend
of 75 cents per share to-day.
The Smuggler Mining Company of Colorado

Great Danger to Foot Passengers
Who Are Not Aware of the
Recent Change of
Track.
Oakland Office San Irancisco Call,
90S Broadway, Oct. 27.
Some attorneys called at the City
Clerk's office to-day and examined the j
ordinance under which a franchise was
granted to the Southern Pacific Company
to lay its Webster-street tracks across!
the sidewalk near Second street, and ]
build a curve so as to run onto the new
Harrison-street drawbridge. The pur
pose of such examination Is undoubtedly
preparatory to bringing a 6utt for dam
ages, as there is a clause in the ordi
oance which has not been obeyed. When
the railroad company applied for the
franchise from Webster to Harrison |
there was much opposition In the Council j
owing to the arguments of Mr. Watkin
son and others that the franchise would
establish another "death curve." The
railroad company overcame this objec
tion by stating that it had purchased the
â whole of the block on which the curve
was to cross, and that it would till it in
and make a public park of the remainder
and that this park should be kept :"
all obstructions, so as to prevent loss of
life because of foot passengers not being
able to see the train.
The new track has been in operation '
some weeks and ihe park has not yet
been created, while at one corner of the
lot there are some shanties which it was '
understood were to be pulled down. These
chanties are on the opposite- corner from
where Othmar Miller was killed last
Tuesday evening. A cement sidewalk haa
leeil In u:>e at this point for some years,
and for twenty years the narrow-gauge i
train has gone down Webster street and
straight over Webster-street bridge. It :
ims across the sidewalk, and resi- 1
dents In that neighborhood think that
.there should be automatic gates across
the' sidewalk, inasmuch as they have hiren
accustomed to use it for so long and
there are many who do not yet under-
Btand that the train switches off its old
track at that point and crosses the block
diagonally. The danger is almost as great
When the- train switches from First street
across the sidewalks onto Webster street j
going north. It was on a northern trip
that Miller was killed. There is a nag
man at the point where the accident oc
curred, but after dark it is impossible for i
a stranger to distinguish his light, espe- j
cially as there are many signal lamps In
that vicinity.
It is thought that the ordinance was be-
Ir.g examined by some one interested in
MfHer's death.
MAHONEY ARRESTED.
Though Twice Looked Into by the
Grand Jury the District Attor
ney Advises Dismissal.
OAKLAND, Oct. 27.â William Mahoney,
who was arrested last night on a charge
of perjury preferred by Fred Murdoch:,
ex-Assistant Chief of the Fire Depart
ment, has been released on $30000 bonds.
Mahoney is particularly charged with
having illegally registered last July, he
having sworn to his age as 22 years, when,
as Murdock claims, he is not 21.
The case is a most peculiar one, since
the Grand Jury investigated Mahoney
twice and believing him of age had
dropped the matter. Furthermore, it ap-
Bears that the complaipant went to the
'istrict Attorney's office yesterday to se
cure a warrant, and being refused, ap
peared before Justice of the Peace Law
rence and' finally obtained a warrant.
Mahoney was arraigned before Justice
Lawrence this morning. He had no coun
eel and refused to plead. On the other
hand Deputy District Attorney A. A.
Moore Jr. moved for a dismissal on the
ground that the complaint had no foun
dation upon which a conviction could be
Efccured. Justice Lawrence refused to
grant this, saying he did not wish to take
snap Judgment on the complaining wit
ness, who, he believed, should be given
a chance to be heard.
Attorney Moore then asked the court
whether he was acting on the advice of
Murdock or on the advice of the Dis
trict Attorney's office. The court replied
that he was not taking Murdock's advice,
and after more words the case was set for
next Saturday morning.
Mahoney's arrest is the sequel of a
Fire Department row.
PROBABLE WILL CONTEST.
Indications That the Estate of Han-
nah Butler Will Be Litigated.
OAKLAND, Oct. 27.â There is likely to '
be a contest over the estate of Hannah j
Butler, who died in this city on Septem- j
ber 2* last. Mrs. Butler left a will be
queathing all of her estate to friends and
relatives, except $5, which is left to her
husband. Patrick Butler, aged 75 years, ]
she "believing that he has enough money
and plenty of property of his own."
There are several peculiarities about
the affairs of decedent which bespeak a
woman of considerable eccentrcity. Her |
estate consists for the most part of cash. |
She has 15261 30 deposited in the Hibernia '
Savings and Loan Society under the name
of Clara White; $2000 in La Societie Fran
caiae under the name of Mrs. A. McCar
thy: $2000 in the- Humboldt Savings and
Loan Society under the name of Hannah
McCarthy, besides a house and lot at to! 0
Kirkham street.
By the terms of the will the house and
lot are bequeathed to Mary Hook of this !
city; Herman and John Sou pal re of Oak- !
land and San Rafael respectively are each
to receive $2500; John Hook of Omaha.
Neb., $2000, and Hannah Leary of Oakland,
$1000.
Rev. Brother Michael of h n Rafael is
named in the will as exp< a , r , and tes
tator "appoints Brother _K*-iel guardian
Â«f John and Herman Soupaire."
Death Was by Asphyxiation.
OAKLAND, O<t. 27. â Coroner Raldwin
and a jury this morning inquired into the
death of John Campbell at Llvermore. Ine
evidence showed that decedent and A. A.
Fargo, the latter being foreman of tne
"Wallace Everson vineyard, near Liver
more, went to a wine tank for the pur
pose of giving the same its periodical
cleaning. Campbell entered first, and
Fargo was to have followed. Campbell
made an effort to get out again, when
Fargo, jrrabliing him, tried to pull him
out, but without avail. Decedent dropped
back into the tank and \v;)s asphyxiated
by the gases. A verdict of death by as
phyxiation was rendered.
Charged With Murderous Assault.
OAKLAND, Oct. 27.â Charles Degreef,
a sailor, was brought to the County oail
about noon to-day charged with assault
to murder Howard Davis. J?oUi men re-
Bide in San Francisco, and were on a
leave of absence. They had Imbibed free
ly of Alameda whisky, and during a dis
pute on High street, in the Enclnal City,
Degreef, it is charged, pulled a weapon
and tried to kill his opponent, when by
standers prevented further harm.

GRAND JURY
AT LAST FILES
ITS REPORT
Indulges in Usual
Criticism.
CHURCH IS COMMENDED
COUNTY HOSPITAL SAID TO BE
A FIRST-CLASS PLi-CE.
The Late Frank P. Thwaite Was Paid
Vast Sums of Money on
Alleged Raised
Orders.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, Oct. 27.
The long-expected, report of the Grand
Jury was filed this afternoon, and was a
great disappointment to those who ex
pected an interesting document contain
ing- facts. Instead it dealt with a host of
generalities, and contained nothing that
has not from time to time been published
during ihe ten months' investigation of
the body.
The report commends the management
of the County Jail and City Prison. It
pays a high tribute to the management of
the County Infirmary, of which Super
visor Will H. Church is the chairman.
The report says:
The hallways and rooms throughout the
buildings were well ventilated and thoroughly
clean, the food abundant and of good quality,
everything Indicating proper discipline and
commendable attention to the wants and com
fort of tfce inmates.
Seeing so much to commend In this Institu
tion, it is with some reluctance that we call
attention to the large increase in expenditures
fur 1537 over the preceding- year, viz., $14,401 89.
It Is true that a portion of this was spent
on the new reservoir, pipe line, fire protection
plant, new buildings, etc., permanent improve
ments that possibly could have been deferred
to a more convenient season, but, nevertheless,
very necessary to the completeness of a first
class Infirmary, -which this certainly Is.
In referring to the expenses of the hos
pital â  the following- typical sentence oc
curs: "While a few items in the list of
ordinary expenses seem rather large,
there is one, namely $5413 30, for drugs
and medicines, that is certainly, to put it
mildly, colossal."
The County Constables are criticized
as being: very careless, and the Supervi
sors are recommended to keep an "al
lowance book," such as the law requires,
and several subjects are mentioned as be
ing fit material for the next Legislature
to work upon. The Coroner is commend
ed as an official, but criticized for his
stenographic bills. Supervisor Talcott is
commended as the only member of the
board who filed proper reports of the re
lief given to indigents. in commenting
upon the investigation of the water rates
last spring the report says: "We found
a deplorable loss of memory by certain of
the Councilmen on subjects connected
with the fixing of water rates. We also
thoroughly investigated the charges of
bribery and corruption in the matter of
police appointments by the Board of Pub
lic Works, but were unable to discover
evidence of acts of an actual criminal
character." ' '
The Grand Jury recommends to the
legislative delegation from Alameda
County the following: .â .-,- ;â 'â â 
Firstâ The abolition of the fee system gov
erning Justices and Constables.
Secondâ An amendment to the county gov
ernment act that will require all Justices when
filing claims for their services to make an
affidavit to the effect that their dockets are
written up as far as possible to date and that
all fines and forfeitures received by them have
been paid over by them in accordance with the
law, and prohibiting the Board of Supervisors
allowing any Justice's claims to which such
affidavit has not been made.
Thirdâ An amendment to the county govern
ment act directing the County <"lÂ«-rk to issue
to stenographers upon their filing their tran
scripts a certificate stating the date that said
transcript was so filed and the exact number
of folioi contained in said transcript, the sten
ographer to deliver said certificate to the proper
magistrate, who shall not sign a Judge's order
for transcribing such testimony until he is
thus made officially aware of the number of
folios so filled: neither shall he sign the same
if said transcript has not been filed within ten
days after the defendant has been held to an
swer.
Fourthâ That the amount of compensation to
be allowed stenographers for transcribing their
shorthand notes b(.- fixe 1 at 10 cents per folio
for the .â¢nuir.ui transcription and 5 cents per
folio for additional copies.
Fifth â That the law be amended so as to re
quire a mig!*<trate upon signing each Judge's
order for stenographers to send to the County
Auditor by mall or otherwise a certificate giv
ing the date, name of stenographer and amount
signed for, duly signed by himself, and prohib
iting the Auditor from issuing a warrant until
such certificate had been received by him and
found to correspond with the order as signed.
The expert for the Grand Jury went
back to the records of 1892, and from his
investigation it appears that during the
past six years Frank P. Thwaites the of
ficial stenographer, who died some
months ago. raiser! his orders on the
county treasury until he defrauded the
county of over $20,000.
The manner in which Thwaites is al
leged to have worked is thus described
by .the expert:
After working for one day Thwaites would
present an order for his pay, amounting to $10,
make the affidavit out and the Justice would
sign the order; the amount would be entered
in figures only, but the blank space Just over
the Justices signature where the amount
Fhould be filled in in writing he purposely left
vacant and the Justice seldom if ever paid any
attention to It. Here. then, was an oppor
tunity; he would make a ftsjure (say 4) out of
the 1; that would make four days instead of
one; then change In like manner the $10 to $40
and insert the words "forty" and "00" in
writing in the blank space over the Justice's
signature and the order was ready to be
cashed. _________
A CLEW TO GOETZ.
The Missing Stanford Student Was
Seen Sunday by an Alameda
Policeman.
ALAMEDA, Oct. 27.â The Alameda Po
lice Department is making no effort to
locate Adolph Goetz, the missing Stan
ford student, who was last seen In this
city. They say they have not been offi
cially notified of his disappearance, and
without such official notification do not
feel called upon to volunteer their ser
vices In the search for the missing man.
Mrs. A. H. Clark, of 1417 Sherman
street, at whose home Goetz was visiting
at the time he disappeared, called at the
police station Sunday afternoon with a
picture of the young man. She told the
officer in charge that the photograph was
that of a friend who had disappeared,
but she refused to give his name. She
left the picture, however, and it remained
at police- headquarters until the following
day when she sent for it.
A possible clew to the missing student
is furnished by Officer Kamp. He saw
the picture, and states that late Sunday
afternoon he saw a young man who very
much resembled the photograph walking
along Park street in the direction of the
tidal canal.
"Not knowing the young fellow's name,
or the name of the lady who had report
ed him missing. I was in no position to
stop him, as he was minding his own
business and disturbing no one," said the
policeman. ,
I'u to this evening nothing further had
been heard of the young man. Mrs.
("lark has received Information from Palo
Alto to the effect that when Qoetz left
the university Saturday he had over $60
in his possession. How much of this he
had left when he reached Mrs. Clark's
home is not known, as he did not display
any money there and did not discuss his
financial affairs.

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, FBIDAY, OCTOBER 28, IC9B.1 C 9B.
IS IN FEAR i
, OF DEATH IN
HER HOI
Her Husband Used
Knives and Razors.
AN ABUSED WIFE'S STORY
MRS. SPENCER FREE AFTER
TWENTY-ONE YEARS.
Her Once Penitent Husba- d Wrote
Threatening Letter, but Did
Not Carry Out His
Intention.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Oct. 27.
Margaret F. Spencer is a free woman;
that is to say, after twenty-one years
of wedded life with Lysander Spencer
Judge Greene has granted her a decree
of divorce.
There have been some sensational di
vorce stories lately told in the Alameda
courts, but none more heartrending than
the tale of marital unhappinesa and cru
elty related by Mrs. Spencer. Twenty
one years ago they were married. Before
their wedding- Mrs. Spencer discovered
that her husband cultivated habits not
tending toward happiness. It was partly
with a desire to reform him that she
consented to become his wife. For years
he gradually fell from grace, but did
nothing to cause an open breach. Some
years ago his mother-in-law died, and
Spencer a few days after the burial en
tered the house and wanted to know "if
the racket was all over." Mrs. Spencer
resented such language referring to the
burial of her mother, and there was a
quarrel. According to the testimony
Spencer dragged his wi/e to the rear of
the house, raised a knife in anger and
suddenly, becoming smitten with grief,
cried out "Maggie, I can't kill you. He
satisfied his anger on that occasion by
cutting the arteries of his own wrist.
Mrs. Spencer said from that day she
has been in constant dread for her life,
and that on many occasions she has frus
trated her husband's plans. Tn May. 1897,
Spencer was attacked with Klondicitis
and he asked his wife for money with
which to go north. She declined to give
him any and he became mad, and, accord
ing to Mrs. Spencer, told her her time
had come. This episode was terminated by
a visit from another tenant In the house
who had heard the disturbance. Mrs.
Spencer fled from home, and her husband,
prostrate with grief at their unhapplness,
wrote his wife a note in which he said:
"I will leave this cold, cold world by
my own hand. Life is a failure for me.
No God. no wife, no fireside. This is the
last news from me. The next time you
hear from me will be in happy, blessed
death. This is not idle talk, for you Will
find me dead in the house of your friend."
Apparently the talk was idle, for hus
band and wife lived together until he
handled a razor in an unbecoming man
ner and Mrs. Spencer departed.
After hearing the little story Judge
Greene decided that Mrs. Spencer might
be divorced from her husband.
A NITROGLYCERIN
TANK EXPLODES
THREE MEN NARROWLY ES
CAPE INSTANT DEATH.
Combustible Chemicals Play Havoc
in the Factory of the California
Vigorit Powder Company.
BERKELEY, Oct. 27.â A storage tank at
the California Vigorit Powder Works at
Point Isabel exploded about 11:30 o'clock
this morning. Had the accident hap
pened a minute earlier the event would
have turned into a tragedy, bringing to
three men an instant death.
The explosion occurred in what Is
known as the recovery building, where
nitric and sulphuric acids are separated
from nitroglycerln. It appears that the
glycerin In the receiver became over
heated, either spontaneously or from the
presence of a greater quantity of the ma
terial than the volume of the receiver
will allow, and the big tank blew up with
out a moment's warning.
The shock was distinctly felt in Berke
ley, a distance of four miles. The prin
cipal damage was confined chiefly to the
scene of the accident, although several
windows were broken In some of the sur
rounding houses. The magazine and
packing houses standing about a hun
dred feet away were left unharmed.
The escape of the three men belonging
to the company was almost miraculous.
Robert Burcher. in charge of the recov
ery building, together with John Cain
and Superintendent P. G. Gallagher, had
just stepped out of the building when ihe
upheaval came. They were in one of the
sheds near by, and escaped without in
jury.
In explaining the cause of the acci
dent Frank J. Gallagher, one of the offi
cers of the company, said: "I feel sure
that the glycerin in the tank became
heated spontaneously, for I don't see how
the tank could have gone up in any other
way. This morning 'here was not more
than twenty pounds of glycerin In it,
but even that was sufficient to cause this
wreck. Even with the greatest care in
this work an explosion sometimes hap
pens."
FELL THIRTY FEET
THROUGH A SKYLIGHT
ARTHUR HOLMES' MIRACULOUS
ESCAPE FROM DEATH.
Dropped From the lloof of the Oak
land Iron Works, Sustaining a
Cerebral Contusion.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
SOB Broadway, Oct. 27.
Arthur Holmes, aged 15 years, residing
with his parents at 213 Third street, fell
through a skylight in the roof of the Oak
land Iron Works to-night to the floor be
low, a distance of nearly thirty feet. He
miraculously escaped death.
There is a cupola on the roof In which
iron is melted, and to prevent sparks ig
niting the timbers about it 1b necessary
to dampen the surface in its immediate
vicinity. Holmes was engaged in this
latter work when it was quitting time, 6
o'clock. The surface of the roof was wet.
He in some manner lost his hold, sliding
until he reached the skylight, when he
crashed through the panes and fell upon
the floor in the machine shop below.
He was picked up unconscious and
taken to the Receiving Hospital, where
he was treated for a severe 6calp wound.
So far as could be determined to-night he
sustained no other injuries, though there
is little doubt he is injured internally.
When Holmes' body crashed through
i the skylight most of the employes at the
works had left for the day. Had not the
noise of the breaking panes attracted the
attention of a man, who returned to in
vestigate, the boy would have remained
there all night unattended.
Marriage Without a Home.
OAKLAND, Oct. 27.â Leah E. Stutt
wants to be divorced. She has been mar
ried nearly a year, but her husband has
no idea of giving her a home. In No
vember, 1597, ehe sayÃ In her complaint,
the wedding took place, and the first piece
of information that the husband gave his
wife was that he was unable to supply
a home, and he kindly advised her to live
with her parents. The bride, who was
17 years old, took her husband's advice.
She went home and she is still at home.
She declares that her husband has never
since offered to give her a home or to
provide any support for herself and their
little child. Mr. Stutt is earning $100 a
month and the young wife thinks she is
entitled to one-half of this amount.
His Head Split Open.
OAKLAND, Oct. 27.â G. E. Garrison, a
lumber man of Diamond, Cal., fell down
the long flight of steps leading to the
waiting room at the Oakland mole this
morning, and was seriously injured. His
head was split open and before he reached
the Receiving Hospital a hemorrhage had
almost caused his death.

OAKLAND, Oct. 27.â The Alameda

Barely Escaped Death.
ALAMEDA, Oct. 27.â Ward Wells, the
eight-year-old son of C. B. Wells of the
Hawaiian Islands, nearly lost his life last
evening by falling from the platform of
a narrow gauge train. The little fellow
was visiting friends in Alameda and took
the 5 o'clock train at Chestnut street sta
tion to ride as far as Morton street. He
stood on the platform and lost his bal
ance by the jolting of the cars. He fell,
striking the ground within six inches of
the rails, but fortunately rolled away
from the track. His face was severely
bruised and cut, one eye was badly in
jured and he suffered a slight concussion
of the brain.

SEVEN PINES CIRCLE
HAS A CAMPFIRE
CHARLES L. PATTON'S PORTRAIT
EVOKES APPLAUSE.
A Pretty Drill by Ladies of the Circle
and a Soldier's Old Time
Camp Feast.
There was a laree audience in B'r.ai
B'rith Hall last night to enjoy the pro
gramme prepared by the members of
Seven Pines Circle, Ladies of the G. A.
R., for thtlr twelfth annual camp fire.
There was a profusion of patriotic deco
rations and on the walls were the names
of many of the prominent candidates on
the Republican tickets.
Mrs. James H. Whitesides presided, and
after an overture of patriotic airs, she
introduced Dr. Danziger, who delivered
an address on the noble wurk that thÂ«
ladies of the order are engaged in. MtM
Annie Corrigan gave two recitations; Mr.
Wilson and Mrs. Ida L^roi amused the
audience with a rendition in character of
"The Chinee and the Coon." after which
there were vocal (selections by a quintet
of the Fifty-first lowa Volunteers.
As the vocalists retired a veteran ap
peared on the stage, placed a staff on the
center and without uttering a word, hung
on it 'a white silken banner, surrounded
with red white and blue. In the center
was a tine likeness of Charles L. Patton,
the Republican candidate for Mayor, ana
above it was painted in letters of gold
his name and the office to which he win
be elected. This silent appeal produced a
marked effect on those who gazed at the
stage and with one accord there was a
tremendous burst of applause, showing
that the great majority was in accord
with the candidacy of Mr. Patton.
This incident was followed by a drill
by the following named ladies of the cir
cle, who were attired in a neat uniform
in which the red, white and blue predom
inated: Anne Eyers, president of the cir
cle; Jeannette Harvey, Lizzie Isolle,
Laura Oblinger, Abble Powis, Annie i.
Black Lulu Watrou, Annie Schweitzer,
Ella Tate, Lizzie Houtz, Sadie Pierpont,
Marchie Wenk, Rosie Perry, Louise Carr,
Jennie Martin and Julia Duhem. This
corps was put through a number of evolu
tions by J. E. Tower of the Fifty-first
lowa. A pretty feature of the drill was
the formation in living letters of the ab
breviation of the name of the order, L.
of T G. A. R. The ladies were rewarded
by long and loud applause.
After the drill there was dancing and
an old-fashioned camp fire supper, con
sisting of soldiers' fare.
CHAMPIONSHIP REGATTA.
Oarsmen Preparing for a Day of Ex
citing Sport at Old Long Bridge.
The regatta committee of the Pacific
Athletic Association is hard at work pre
paring for the championship races to bÂ«j
held at Long Bridge on Sunday, Novem
ber 6. A meeting was held Wednesday
night, at which the following members of
the board of nTanagera were present. W. C. ,
Espey (chairman), J. R. Bockman (sec- ;
retary), J. W. Morton, M. Breen, S. J. [
Pembroke and A. P. Rothkopf. The re
gatta will be on a large scale, and great
preparations are being made for it. A
band of music will be engaged, and will
play throughout the day. J. R. Bock
man, M. Breen and S. J. Pembroke were
appointed a committee to look after the
musical part of the programme. A stand
will be erected on the bridge, from which
candidates for office who have donated
subscriptions to the regatta funds may
address the people. Saloon privileges
have been granted to Louis yon Harten,
but no gambling or poolselling will be
permitted, the intention being to make the
event a purely amateur one.
E. Flanders will set the stakes and
supply the launch for the committee. The
names of candidates who have given sub
scriptions to the regatta will be painted
upon a banner, the name of only one
candidate for each office being accepted
by the committee. The following candi
dates have already contributed: Julius j
Kahn, candidate for Congress; John D. '
Siebe, for Assessor; Henry S. Martin, for
Sheriff; Charles F. Curry, for Secretary
of State: John H. Grady, for Auditor; Ed
H Kalben. William H. Phelps, Howard
Black, Ed Holland, Dr. E. C. Perrault
and Ed I. Sheehan for Supervisors, and
C. F. Kenneally for Assemblyman of the
Twenty-ninth District. A circular letter
mentioning all the candidates who have
contributed will be sent to every member j
of the rowing clubs on the bay, and to
all persons upon the invitation lists of the
clubs.
The regatta promises to be very inter
esting and to furnish several exciting con
tests. It is highly probable that the re
sults of the regatta recently held on Rus
sian River will, in several instances, be
reversed.
FOR THE TEACHERS' FUND.
"The Kubaiyat" With Musical Ac
companiment Furnishes a Fine
Entertainment.
The Teachers' Mutual Aid Society took
a benefit at Metropolitan Temple last
evening, which judging by the attendance,
was certainly a social and financial suc
cess.
The feature of the very excellent pro
i gramme was "The Rubaiyat" with musi
i cal accompaniment. Mrs. Florence Wy
1 man Gardner, soloist at Simpson Memo
rial Church; Mrs. Edith Scott Basford,
Frank Coffin and Robert Taylor Bien of
St Luke's Church, did full justice to the
exquisite music, both in the solo work
and the concerted pieces. Mary, Susan
and Dorothy Pasmore added greatly to
the evening's enjoyment, with their ex
cellent trios for piano, violin and violon
cello.
A Polytechnic Victory.
The Polytechnic High School football
team defeated St. Ignatius College yes
terday by a score of 30 to 0. The game was

A PROBLEM FOR THE JUDGE.
He Must Decide Who Is the Owner
of a Goat and Its Kid.
A most perplexing problem will be sub
mitted to Judge Joaehimsen this morning
and much Interest Is manfested as to the
result of his decision. Lawyers and citi
zens are equally interested and when the
case i 3 heard there will be a crowded
courtroom.

ilton, a lady SO years of age, living on
Twenty-second and Tennessee streets, ob
tained a search warrant from Assistant
Prosecuting Attorney Drury of Judge
Joachimsen's court for the recovery of
a goat which had been stolen from her
eighteen months ago. Since then she had
been constantly searching for the goat
and it was only Wednesday that she dis
covered her pet In the yard of John
Dwyer, on the Potrero hill, near Sixteenth
atreet.
What pleased her more than anything
else was to find that a kid was disporting
â¢itself beside the goat as she had looked
forward to the advent of the kid with
feelings of joy, as she longed to make a
particular pet of It. She made a demand
upon Dwyer for the return of the goat
and the kid, but Dwyer denied that either
belonged to her.
She told her story to Drury and he
thought the scare)] warrant should In
clude the kid as well as the goat, but it
would rest with the Judge to determine
whether Dwyer could lay claim to the
kid. She said she was prepared to swear
that the goat and kid belonged to her, but
Dwyer denies that the goat .ever was hers
and therefore both the goat and kid are
his property.
Policeman C. M.Barnes went with Mrs.
Hamilton to the Dwyer homestead and
she pointed out the goat, which Barnes
seized in virtue of the search warrant.
The kid could not be seen and Barnes had
to leave without it. He took the goat to
the City Prison, where its appearance
caused the greatest consternation. Ser
geant Lindheimer objected to have any
thing to <lo with the goat. "What do you
think 1 am, " he roared at Barnes. '"'Do
you think I am the poundkeeper? Take
ft away. I don't care what you do with
it." This In answer to a question of
Barnes, who seemed perplexed to know
what to do. Finally It was arranged that
the goat should be taken to Westphal's
stable; 3 to await the decision of the Judge
this morning.

WHICH ONE IS THE HEIR?
The Alcazar Leading^Man and His Counterfeit Pre
sentment Are Busy Looking Up an
English Inheritance.
'ERNEST WILUA/v\
HASTINGS
ERNEST HASTINGS, the leading man of the Alcazar Theater, has
met his double, who not only shares with him feature for feature
but name for name. The unadulterated name of the actor is William
Ernest Hastings, and of his counterfeit presentment Ernest William Hast
ings. The leading man, however, in deference to his good square chin
in boyhood days dropped the William and Is commonly known by his mid
dle name, Ernest.
Ernest William Hastings, accompanied by his legal adviser, is at pres
ent in this city endeavoring to trace up relatives In the hope of proving
heirshlp to Â£22.600 left by the death of an aunt in Lancashire, England, to
Ernest Hastings of New York. The Alcazar actor's home Is In New York,
and It seems that Ernest William Hastings also lived there. In the will
there was no middle initial given, but attached to it was an unmounted
photograph which would answer for either party owing to the striking re
semblance. Actor Hastings says that for some months prior to coming out
here to till the Alcazar engagement he was visited by a relative who
was on his way to Europe to spend the summer with relatives there.
Hastings had just received proofs of some photos of a sitting he had
taken, and at the request o*f his relative gave him one of them. That party
has not yet returned home, neither has Ernest hoard from either him or
other of his relatives in some time. He says he has relatives in Canada,
also some living in Southampton and Liverpool, but knew of none resid
ing in Lancashire.
Hastings knew nothing of his "double," or that any property had been
left until he was approached yesterday by the attorney for Ernest Wil
liam Hastings, who, thinking that he might be a relative, could shed
some light upon his pedigree. The astonishment of the lawyer when
meeting the very likeness of his client can only be imagined. By appoint
ment both gentlemen met, but Ernest William Hastings could disclose
but few facts, as he knew but little of his people. However, he remem
bered hearing when a boy his father say he had relatives living In Eu
rope, and that some day he might be a wealthy man. He said he sent
his photograph to the authorities in several of the leading European cit
ies, asking them if they could trace up his people. Since then he has re
ceived no reply, until some ten days ago there was mailed to him a copy
of a weekly paper published In London, bearing- a cut of the will and his
photograph.
The Alcazar's leading man has dispatched a letter to an uncle of his
living in Brooklyn, directing him to Investigate at once whether or not he
1b the rightful claimant to the $112,500 now awaiting an owner in England.

F. Cragln, the Chicago engineer and con
tractor, and Edward Eyere and Frank S.
Washburn of New York City, have made
an agreement with President Zelaya to
construct an interoceanic canal. Under
the terms of the concession they are au
thorized to negotiate with the Maritime
Canal Company, whose concession will
elapse next October. The"*fonn of agree

$400,000 more within three months after.
They must organize a company within
six months, begin the excavation of the
canal within twenty-six months, open up
some transit route across Nicaragua
within three years and complete the canal

LOOKING FOR
t POISON IN
THE SUPS
Chemist Green Begins
His Analysis.
SEEKING FOR PTOMAINES
CURIOUS PROCESSES FOLLOWED
IN THE WORK.
An Investigation Fraught With
Interest and Important Results
to One Branch of
Science.
The disreputable Butehertown shrimps,
after enjoying a long period of immunity
at the hands of the law, are in serious
trouble.
Yesterday morning City Chemist Frank
Green, acting under special orders from
the San Francisco Board of Health, sent
two deputies to the slaughter-house
â wharves, armed with long cane poles, sea
grass lines and sharp hooks, to cap
ture thirty or more of the swarm of dan
gerous little wretches for analytical pur
poses. The deputies' efforts were crowned
with success and within a short time they
wended their way toward the city build
ings with the required number of shrimps.
To-day Professor Green will begin sci
entific operations upon them, and by the
time he gets throutrh there will be very
little left of these good-for-nothing
shrimps, except, possibly, a few ounces
of poison, a pot of sulphuretted hydrogen
and some unsavory memories.
For a long period of time fishermen
plying their trade in the waters of the
bay in the vicinity of the Butchertown
wharves have complained of violent
stomachic pains, necessitating frequent
calls for the doctor and heavy medical
bills, thereby entailing financial discom
"fort as well as physical suffering. As
the pains usually followed the eating of
Butchertown shrimps all theories of dys
pepsia were soon swept to the winds by
the suspicion, which soon ripened into
belief, that the shrimps were poisonous.
Nobody thought for a minute that the
fish had resorted to the dissemination of
poison with malice aforethought, but the
fact remained that shrimps in other por
tions of the bay were palatable to the
taste and wholesome for the digestion.
Finally the fishermen complained to the
Board of Health about the matter and
Dr. Gallwey made an investigation, re
porting tha"t he was led to believe that
the Butchertown shrimps were highly sea
soned with poisonous ptomaines. He ad
vised that Chemist Green be instructed
to analyze the fish and see whether or
not his conclusions were correct. Sev
eral citizens who had purchased some of
the shrimps in open market and who suf
fered for their indiscretion made the
neuter still more urgent, and the chem
ist was told to get to his work on the
analysis as soon as possible.
Professor Green will chop the shrimps
ir.to small pieces. He will put the tt.-h
through various machines of brass, glass
and iron; pass them through varied col
ored acids and alkalies, gradually dissipat
ing the fleshy substance and the bor.es
and aiming to save nothing except the
poisonous ptomaines, if such exist. The
operation will require a number of days
and the outcome will be watched with
interest. Up to the present time pto
maine poisoning has never been clearly
explained by scientists. Investigations
on the subject arein progress in all of the
medical institutions of this country and
Europe. It is now believed that pro
cesses of decomposition in animal mat
ter generate ptomaines of several hun
dred different kinds. The eating of de
cayed animals by fish would transfer the
ptomaines to them.
If it 111 found that the Butchertown
shrimps are deadly when dead, fishermen
will be warned to let them alone in the
future and will be advised to do their
angling in Oakland and Alameda waters,
where the shrimps are of unblemished
reputation.
The shrimp investigation will be the
first work undertaken in the new labor
atory just finished. The apparatus is of
the most complete character. In fact,
the laboratory is the finest west of Chi
cago. It will be possible to conduct the
most exhaustive inquiries Into various
food products sold in the market, with a
view to the detection of adulterations.
PERU MUST NOW PAY
MACCORD $40,000
Award of the Chief Justice of Canada
for the Imprisonment of the
Consular Agent.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 27.â The award of
the Chief Justice of Canada, to whose ar
bitration was submitted the claim of Vic
tor H. Maccord against the Government
of Peru for damages sustained by reason
of imprisonment during one of the revo
lutionary outbreaks there, has been re
ceived at the State Department. Mac
cord is awarded $40,000. The payment of
this amount will close a diplomatic con
troversy which has been in progress be
tween the United States and Peru for six
years, this Government having persist
ently, but fruitlessly, heretofore urged
reparation for Maccord.
The settlement provides that the money
must be paid to Maccord within six
months from the date of the award. Fees
to the Chief Justice of Canadaâ slooo by
the United States and $1000 by Peru
were paid before the terms of the award
were made known to the respective gov
ernments. The arbitrator was the Right
Hon. Samuel Henry Strong, P. C. Mac
cord was Consular agent of the United
States at Arequlpa, Peru, In 1885, and also
superintendent of a railroad. During a
revolution he was thrown Into prison and
his life threatened. His original claim
was for $200,000.
Fire at Fresno.
FRESNO. Oct. 'a.â Fire broke out at
about 10 o'clock this evening in the furni
ture store of W. F. McVey, and in a half
hour the place ami $12,000 worth of prop
erty were destroyed. The fire began in the
rear of the store, where considerable ex
celsior and other inflammable material
was stored, and spread rapidly. Had it
not beefk for the bursting of hose, how
ever, it is likely that some of the prop
erty would have been saved. Mcvey s
stock was valued at $10,000, and the insur
ance on it was $6000. The damage to the
building, which is owned by the Bradley
heirs, amounts to about $2000. Nothing
is known of the origin of the fire.

OMAHA, Oct. 27. â Women's domestic
status under the law and her political
success as regarding patriotism; also
what is being done by the Universal

PORTO RICANS SLAP!
BY SPANISH SOLDIERS
Details of the Biot at Arrecibo Be-
tween Countrymen and the
Troops.
SAN JUAN, Porto Rico, October 27.â
Full details of the Arreclbo Incident of
Sunday, October 9, have been received
here, although the Spanish censor declines
to allow their publication in the local
newspapers. It appears that the trouble
began In a row between some soldiers of
the Alfonso XIII battalion and a num
ber of countrymen. The soldiers retreat
ed to the neighboring barracks and, af
ter arming themselves with Mauser rifles,
returned and tired upon the crowd, kill
ing four men and wounding many. Tiie
crowd, to the number of 200, secured ma
chetes and rushed through the streets,
the soldiers retreating to the barracks.
The people then carried their wounded
to the house of the British Consul, where
they found several United States officers
and soldiers, from whom they asked jus
tice.
When the wounded were cared for the
townspeople returned to the scene of the
conflict to destroy the houses of several
well-known Spaniards. Ultimately, how
ever, the persuasive word of cooler men,
coupled with the establishment of a vigi
lance committee, succeeded in restoring
order.
But only for a time. The same after
noon a party of forty Porto Ricans com
pletely destroyed the business house of a
well-known Spaniard. During the affair
an American was killed. The night was
not without its alarm. There was shoot
ing at the barracks, though no one was
hurt. Seventeen different tires in the sur
rounding country were counted from the
housetops of Arrecibp. The following day
most of the business houses remained
closed. That night twenty-four fires were
counted. On Tuesday most of the Spanish
business houses remained closed and
those that opened tht-ir doors were soon
forced to close. The military commander
at last issued an order directing that all
places of business be closed forthwith.

FRESNO, Oct. 27.â Webster Davis. As
sistant Secretary of the Interior, spoke
in Armory Hall to-night to a large audi
ence in spite of the counter attractions
offered by Wallace's circus and the thea
ter. His speech was an eloquent one
and greatly enjoyed, the applause being
frequent and enthusiastic. As the speech
was drawing to a close the fire bells rang
and the people who were proof against
the temptation of the circus and the the
ater began to fidget in their seats and a
few left the hall. Mr. Davis quickly
took in the situation and wisely cut his
address tfhort.
The Arrest of Chin Noon.
SACRAMENTO, Oct. i'7.â Chief of Police
Dwyer this afternoon received a telephone
message from the San Francisco police
office to the effect that Detective Gibson
had gone to consult with the Chinese Con
sul concerning the arrest In this city last
night of Chin Noon on a charge of mur
der. The crime for which he was ar
rested was committed in San Francisco
last Monday night. Chin Noon was then
in this city, employed as a tailor. He
evidently knew, however, that the crime
was to be committed, us he went to see
Chief Dwyer that night to prove his
whereabouts. The Chinaman may be
taken to San Francisco.

UNITED LABOR
PARTY SHOWN
TO BE A FRAUD
Many Forgeries in Its
Petition.
NO PRIMARIES WERE HELD
PHELAHPS PLAN OF APPOINTING
DELEGATES FOLLOWED.
Attorney Garret McEnerney Calls W.
P. Grace a Mountebank and aii
Enemy to Society â A
Warm Time.
The Supreme Court did not listen yes
terday to the argument that was to have
been made on the writ of mandate grant
ed by that body on Wednesday to W. P.
Grace, of the sokcalled United Labor
party, against Registrar Biggy. Instead
the court called in Commissioner Chip
man to listen to testimony that indicated
fraud and forgery on a big scale on the
part of the managers of Grace's alleged
political body.
Garret McEnerney, for the respondent,
said in his opening statement that he
proposed to prove that most of the names
on Grace's petition were either forged or
otherwise fraudulent; that the party it
self was no more than a piece club and
a trap through which Grace seeks to get
money by false pretense from the candi
dates for Indorsing their nominations,
and that the money so secured he intend
ed to use for his own private purposes.
He called him a mountebank and an ene
my of society.
Though W. H. H. Hart, for the peti
tioner, argued that as Registrar Blggy's
duties were purely ministerial, he had no
right to go behind the face of the peti
tion to look for fraud. Chief Justice Beat
ty ordered that testimony be taken by
the Commissioner.
Registrar Blggy was the first witness
to take the stand. He testified that Grace
had presented his petition for tiling on
the evening of the 18th lnst, and that he
turned the papers over to his counsel on
the same evening, and that he had also
submitted them to the chairman of the
Grand Jury. "At that time," said Mr.
Biggy, "I was working on two petitions,
both purporting to be of the United Labor j
party. 1 set my deputies to work on the
Grace petition, aiid we found many errors
and apparent forgeries. I so informed
Mr. Grace on the evening of the 2uth. In
ISOO names we found 903 that were not on
the register and 22S that were forged. We
found only 467 in the whole lot that were
genuine."
Chairman Grace followed Mr. Biggy to
the stand. Grace said he was a carpen
ter, but that It had been so long since he
had worked that he had forgotten the
Lapses of memory characterized
his testimony from start to finish. He
could not remember the date of the con
vention, which he thought his party had
held, but thought that it was some time I
last month. Nor could he recall the
names of any of the fifty or sixty mem
bers he thought were present. When
asked how his delegates had been selected
Grace said that he had pursued the plan
of Phelan and his committee of one hun
dred jobchasers and had appointed them.
"You held no primaries?"' said Mr. Mc-
Enerney, in surprise. "No," was the re
ply, "we followed the example of Mayor
Phelan's committee and appointed our
own men whom we knew would stand in
with us."
Grace acknowledged that during the
election of 1596 he had pursued the same
plan he is working now, and at that
time the Republican committee had prom
ised him $250, which he never received.
Mr. McEnerney attempted to pinhimdown
to a statement of how much he had been
promised on the present election and fin
ally elicited the admission that about $500
had been promised. "But," said Grace,
"I'd take fifty per cent if they would pay
it to me down.
Commissioner Chlpman announced that
he had heard enough of that sort of e%'i
dence to acquaint him with the nature of |
Grace's party, and one of Grace's solici
tors, Frank Buckley, was placed on the
stand. His statement was short but im
portant. He swore he had forged, at the
request of Grace, a number of the signa
tures that appeared as bona fide on the
petition and he read the names he had
so forged. Commissioner Chipman shut
out further testimony along that line by
continuing the matter to 10 o'clock thi3
morning, when other witnesses to testify
to forgeries will be introduced.
SARAH B. COOPER'S ESTATE.
The Administratrix Files a Report
and Asks That It Be Dis
tributed.
Harriet E. Skilton, administratrix of
the will of the late Sarah B. Cooper,
filed a report and petition for settlement
of account and final distribution of the es
tate. In the report the administratrix
says she has sold the legacy of $,~<wi
under the last will of Miranda W. Lux
and applied the proceeds to the assets
of the estate. Since the date of her ap
pointment the administratrix avers that
$4536 24 in money has been received by
her; she has paid all outstanding- ac
counts and brought about a complete set
tlement.
The administratrix then asks that the
balance of the estate of Sarah B. Cooper
be distributed to Irene W. Rawlings, ad
ministratrix of the estate of Harriet
Cooper, that the provisions of her will,
she being the sole devisee of her moth
er's estate, may be carried out.
ROWING MEN ENTERTAIN.
Ariel Club Reception and Dance at
Union Square Hall Last Night.
The stage and galleries of Union Square
Hall were gracefully draped last night
with festoons of blue and yellow cheese
cloth in honor of the Ariel Rowing Club's
annual entertainment and dance. After
a potpourri of popular airs had been ac
ceptably rendered by Temple's orchestra,
J. R. Bockman made a few introductory
remarks, which were received with a de
gree of appreciation that clearly proved
his popularity. The well-kno#vn ama
teur singer, Ben Tarbox, sang "The
Champion of the King." and for an en
core gave an anvil song. Messrs. Morey
and McGorey entertained the audience
with selections on the banjo, and Miss
ADVERTISEMENTS.
SHEDSKIN
20 TIMES
My little boy broke with an itching rash.
I tried three doctors and medical college but
he kept getting worse. There teas not one

He was one mass of sores, and the stench was
frightful. In remoring the bandages they
would take the skin with them, and the poor
child's screams were heart-breaking. After
the second application of Cuticttbjl (oint-
ment) I saw signs of improvement, and the
sores to dry up. His skin peeled off twenty
times, but now he is entirely cured.

clusion with a solo by J. Desmond, who
sang as an encore the well-known old

NATIVE SONS AT THE TIVOLI.
Successful Presentation of Lecocq's
"Girofle-Girofla" for the Benefit
of Olympus Parlor.
The Tivoli Opera-house was crowded
last night, chiefly with Native Sons and
Native Daughters, the occasion being a
benefit entertainment for Olympus Parlor
of the Native Sons. \V. A. Deane, Re
publican candidate for County Clerk, had
a box, and his opponent, John A. Brown,
and F. J. Burke, candidate for Justice of
the Peace, occupied another box. The
other two boxes were occupied by F. J.
Muraskv, Democratic candidate for Su
perior Judge, and A. Berthier, candidate
for Recorder.
Lecocq's celebrated comic opera, "Giro
fle-Girona," was the attraction, and was
pleasingly rendered. Elvla Crox assumed
the title role, and was twice encored lor
her capital rendition of <r See How it

The officers of Olympus Parlor are: A.

DEATH CLAIMS A LITTLE
CHILD AT ITS PLAY
HAROLD HAVER SUCCUMBS TO
CARBOLIC POISONING.
While His Mother Slept He Found a
Bottle of the Acid and Swal
lowed Its Contents.
Harold Haver, the three-year-old son
of Philip I. Haver, a contractor living at
3681 Twenty-fourth street, died yesterday
afternoon from drinking a glass of car
bolic acid which he found in a closet.
The mother of the boy has been ill and
while she was lying on a sofa asleep the
little fellow wandered into the kitchen.
In an adjoining- closet, which contained
a number of bottles of medicine, he found
a bottle filled with carbolic acid. Pour
j ing a large portion into a glass he drank
I it. Screaming with pain he ran to his
mother, who took him in her arms to a
near-by drug store. A physician was
summoned hastily, but the child died de
spite his efforts to save the little life.
The Coroner's office was notified, and
Deputy J. G. Tyrrell went on the case.
As the father waived an inquest the body
was not taken to the Morgue.
THE SPORT OF KINGS.
High Class Dogs That Will Speed

side Park.
Great sport will certainly be in order
for the lovers of coursing at Ingleside
Park on Saturday and Sunday. The dogs
that figure in the drawing which was held
last evening are the cream of the ken
nels of this city and State. Among the
saplings are many new dogs which from
appearances should certainly give good
accounts or themselves. The match race
between Mayflower and Rock Island Boy
is all the talk in coursing circles and
will doubtless attract sport lovers from
many parts of the State. The drawing

Holy Cross Fair.
As the time is nearing for the closing of
Holy Cross bazaar at Native Sons' Hall
the ladies at the various booths are giv
ing- attractive programmes of vocal and
instrumental music each evening. Rev.
J. F. MeGinty allows no solicitations for
money, which is a novel departure at a
church fair. Each guest can listen to the
music, see the artistic booths and the
unique prizes without fear of being im
portuned for cash. Whatever is given
must be voluntary.
Last evening Mrs. John Spottiswooa of
Holy Cross booth gave her evening at
home, and the fair was largely attended
by the parishioners, who enjoyed the
classic programme that was rendered.

agement of Mrs. J. Regan, Mrs. O'Toole,
Mrs. Buckley, Mrs. Hartrick, Mrs. Dough

and, in addition to the usual vocal and in
strumental programme, the champion
Irish Jig and reel dancers. Messrs. O'Con
nor and Kellehor, with their entire class
of ladies, will give an exhibition of step
dancing. They will be accompanied by
Professor McCarthy, the Irish piper, and
McMahon. the fiddler. Mr. Patton, the
Republican candidate for Mayor, has
promised to attend again this evening,
which will be his second visit to the fair.
The lunch which is being served each
day from 11 to 2 p'clock at 25 cents, at
tracts a number of business men who are

to give one on Saturday which will beat

fair each evening will be free.

DOCKERY AS
II DETECTIVE
WINS FAME
Holds Up a Producer
of Bad Butter.
REXINGER CAUGHT AT WORK
A MIDNIGHT HAUL FOR THE
FOOD INSPECTOR.
Clever Plan Which Succeeded in Ex
tracting a Confession From a
Manufacturer of Spe
cious Butter.
J. P. Dockery, food inspector and
nemesis of sly resterateurs, has added
one more rung to his ladder of Plnker
tonian accomplishments. This time he
has played the real detective, and, with
a finesse which would do credit to a vet

to call his greatest discovery. Through
THE FAC-SIMILE OF REXINGER'S ATTEMPTED DECOY.
the exercise of his talent the food in
spector has corralled one of his most
dangerous enemies, a manufacturer of
specious butter, something worse than
oleomargarine and a shade or two bet
ter than axle grease.
The offender against the pure food laws
is known by the name of Fred Rexlnger,
and plies his illicit trade at 2300 Mission
street. Yelfterday morning he was placed
in the hands of the police, but he did
not stay long in the City Prison, being
released on $50 bail.
On Wednesday Dookery received a visit
from a stranger. The man introduced
himself as John H. Treegolng, informing
Dockery that he possessed $300 which he
wished to invest in a butter manufactory.
I Knowing that Dockery was versed in
' such matters he deemed it wise to secure
j the tatter's advice before placing his
money in any such business. Dockery
confessed ignorance of such matters, but
offered a substitute, and expressed his
willingness to escort the prospective in
vestor to him. The substitute was Frank
T. Green, the chemist of the Board of
Health. The visitor then became more
confidential, and he showed Dockery a
note which he had received from the
manufacturer, and which is shown in fac
simile elsewhere in these columns.
The chemist, thinking Dockery's com
panion was in search of information in
regard to butter manufacturing, delivered
I a lengthy lecture on the art and shoT^afl
I how pernicious a practice it was. Dock
ery then played his game. With a pres
sure on one of Green's feet he apprised
him that something was wrong. Green
took the hint and withdrew, leaving Dock
ery alone with the investor. Like a true
knight of the road Dockery explained to
Treegoing that he must hold up his hands
and disclose the evil schemes of butter
making in which he was involved. Tree
going attempted a bluff, but it was futile.
Dockery, who is a magnanimous con
querer, said what he wanted was the true
malefactor and Treegoing must take him
to the place where he performed tit*
work; and if he would graciously assent
to this then he, Dockery, would exculpate
Treegoing.
Treegolng saw that there was no hope
for himself, so he gave a reluctant con
sent. They jumped Into a carriage and
were driven out Mission street to the
home of the man who makes a new com
pound composed of grease and butter, but
which parades under the latter name.
The two men, Dockery and Treegoing,
got out of the carriage at 2300 Mission
street, the home of Rexinger. They were
shown into a room dimly lighted by a
lamp reeking with the smell of oil. Dock
ery was introduced by Treegoing as a
friend who wished to invest money in
such a scheme as they were floating.
Rexinger enlarged upon the beauties of
his plan. He showed Dockery how he
produced his composition out of one
pound of butter which cost 25 cents, a
pint of milk, 2*Â£ cents, and the mixture
which he made by formula and the cost
of which was half a cent, the product
being two pounds of butter, selling for 50
cents, a clear gain of 22 cents.
The three men had been sitting about
a table, and Dockery arose. He pulled
back his coat and confronted the mixer
of feeds with a star glittering from his
vest and a gun gleaming in his right
hand. Placing Rexinger under arrest
Dockery, ordered him to leave the house
and acompany him to the City Prison.
No resistance was offered.
As a decoy Rexingtr has letter paper
with a head which shows him to be a
member of the Honolulu firm of Joseph
H. Stein & Co. Dockery thinks this is
simply a blind to gain patronage.

PRICE OF CHAINLESS
BICYCLES CUT IN TWO
MAY CAUSE A SLUMP IN THE
WHEEL MARKET.
The New Figures Indicate That the
Day of High-Priced Bicycles
Has Passed.
The announcement was made yesterday
by the local representatives of an Eastern
bicycle manufacturer to the effect that
their prices on next year's wheels would
be reduced nearly one-half. A chainless
bicycle held this year at $125 will be listed
at $75.
To correspond with this cut on the
chainless wheel, one firm will list its best
chain wheel at $50; another model at $40
and tandems at $75. Cheaper grades will
be sold at $35, $26 and $25.
The question will naturally arise
whether this will not cause a cut in the
prices of all makes of wheels. As no
chain wheel could compete with the
chainless at $125, so will they also be
handicapped at the new price. As the
best chain wheel has been marked down
to $50, it Is expected all the other makes
will be obliged to meet thi3 cut or lose
their business.
This is the biggest single cut ever
made in the price of wheels, and brings
them within reach of the workingman,
who, now that Market street is being
repaved, can soon ride home in comfort
on a wheel of his own. and thus save
10 cents per day from the railroad com
pany.
MISS BENTLEY'S FAREWELL.
Miss Marian Bentley, whose suc
cess in local musical circles
was so marked, is to leave this
coast, having" been engager! by a
leading manager In New York to
give a series of piano recital? in
the East. She is a native daugh
ter, although she obtained her
musical education in European
climes. She made her debut in 1896.
The years of study left their effects
and she was forced to return to
California in the hope of regaining
her health, which she has fortun
ately done. During her stay in this
city she has devoted her attention
to a large class of pupils, and many
of them will join her in New York
City that they may have the op
portunity of continuing their stud
ies when she completes her tour.
She will give her farewell recital
this evening at the Young Men's
Christian Association auditorium,
corner Mason and Ellis streets. She
will be assisted by Rhys Thomas,
tenor.
Pearl Ladd's Becital.
Miss Pearl Alden Ladd. the child pianist
and reciter, gave one of her unique en
tertainments last night at the Sherman
& Clay Hall. Her clever interpretations
of dramatic and pianoforte literature
won the applause of a quite numerous
audience. Miss Ladd will give a matinee
on Saturday in the same hall, commencing
promptly at 2:15.
Candy-Makers' Ball.
The candy makers will give their fifth
annual ball at B'nai B'rith Hall. 121 Ed<ly
street, to-morrow evening. A large num
ber of tickets have been sold up to date
and a bis crowd will be in attendance.
The music â¢Rill be furnished by a full or
chestra, and candy will *>c distributed
free to all.

Bookmaker George Rose Will Be
Here Next Week â Jockey Tom
my Rutter Gets In.
Items of Interest.
Joseph A. Murphy, who will fill the |
position of presiding judge at Oakland
track during the coming season, arrived j
here from St. Louis Wednesday evening, !
accompanied by his family. Joe, as he
is better known to turfites, presided in
the stand during the long meeting at St.
Louis, and says the Fair Grounds Asso
ciation experienced a very profitable sea- I
son. He says many of the horsemen he i
met before leaving for California signi
fied their Intention of coming this way,
and he sees no reason why the meetings
here this winter should not be as pros- j
perous as those in the past. Last sea- j
son Mr. Murphy occupied the stand as
presiding judge at both Ingleside and |
Oakland, whore his decisions met with i
general approval. This year he retires
at Ingleside track in favor of Edwin F.
Smith, the Sacramento racing official.
George Rose, the "leviathan California
bookmaker," as he has been termed by
enthusiastic Eastern writers, will return
here the early part of the coming week.
According to Sam Shaen, one of his block
men, George found the Eastern game
more advanced than ever. He started j
off $15,000 loser before one box of chalk :
had been used up, but managed to get
out, and broke about even.
Tommy Rutter, a light-weight rider who
gained considerable renown on the Chi
cago tracks by reason of some shifty
work in the saddle, was expected last
evening. He was here last winter with
Louis Ezell, but got very little chance
to show his worth.
trom present indications it looks as
ugh a bis field will line up in the
>ning handicap to-morrow. The prob
b starters with the riders that are apt
be seen up are: Satsuma, 122, H.
elds; *Grady, 116, Hennessy; Rubicon,
Butler; Buckwa. 112, Piggott; Morel
, 112, Wilson; Rosinante, 110. Gray;

Marplot, 103, Thorpe; Recreation, 98,
Wood; Highland Ball. %. Houok; Ranier,
tOlinthus, 89, Rutter. San Venado and
mmax are doubtful starters.
he track over the bay is gradually
ing on a velvety surface, and now
mises to be very fast. Not a few of
trainers had their charges out yes
terday morning, and several of the handi
cap candidates were moved at more than
three-quarter speed. Marplot covered a
mile in l:45 l>;l >; Wheel of Fortune in 1:444,
and Buckwa traveled around In 1:47.
Grady went a nice mile, reeled oft In
1:45. Satsuma worked three seconds
slower.
Billy Beverly, who will be out this way
as the meeting progresses, is reported to
be a heavy winner booking on the far
Eastern tracks. Beverly has a very keen
eye, and while booking here last season
frequently spoiled the market for many
a "lobster" dealer.
"Bill" uangford, formerly in the employ
of George Rose and well known to local
habitues ojf the track, is issuing an elab
orate turf souvenir in Chicago from the
proceeds of which he expects to reap
large dividends.
Harry Lowden, the hustling entry clerk,
has severed his connection with the Cali-
Knla Jockey Club people.
he programme or score card at Ingle
Â» track this season will be entirely de
d of advertisements. It will be simi
to the old single card form,
very vacant window, garret, basement,
!ar and empty room in the first block
on Ellis street Is being rapidly gobbled
up by prospective bookies for a pool
room. Even the old barn on Glasgow
alley is being dusted out, prior to the
grand reopening. The Queer street math
ematicians figure that with the "old
board" going out and the "new one" com
ing in there will be nothing doing for a
I pie of months at least, and seem jubi
t over the fact that everything will
wide open,
ouble Quick, recently purchased in
East by "Curly" Brown, won the last
c on the card at Latonia yesterday,
lelng his first start with the starter's
colors up. Brown, who is looming up as
quite a successful owner, recently gave
out that he had forsaken the starting
business.
From all accounts Tom Ryan held an
old-fashioned watermelon bee at Chicago
the last two weeks of racing there, at
which the bookmakers were all invited.
He handed them two hot ones in The
Pride and Dunois, and now they don't
like his game. The first named was
pounded down from 20 to 1, to 8 to 5.
Another batch of horsemen got in on
last night's overland train. Marsh Redos
was the first one to reach his hotel and
told three new yarns to a group of
friends before registering. He will be
on the block to-morrow. Al Legg and
Andy Blakeley were also about town.
Blakeley left h!s timber-toppers behind,
bringing out Lady Meddlesome and an
other two-year-old.
Willie Sink, the former publisher of a
handicap, better known now as the owner
of the crack colt Formero, accompanied
by Mr. Sink Sr., stepped off the train.
Mr. Sink had on the horse car attached
to the train Formero, Rio Chlco. Board
man and one other. In the same car
one of the Ryan brothers sent three
horses along. About this trio an air of
secrecy was observed. Before leaving
Chicago, Alvarado 11, one of the Sink
string, was sold to Bromley & Co. for
$2000. The erratic gelding Is said to have
developed Into a wonderful jumper.
The car of Duke & Wlshard is due to
arrive to-day with the well-known per
formers Mary Black, Heigh Ho. Ba
bteca, Judge Woodford, Doremus, Treach
ery and some others. Lester and J.
Reiff, the stable jockeys, will accompany
the horses.
ARRESTED ON SUSPICION.
Two Men Charged With Causing B.
Lacazette's Death.
B. F. Lacazette, the saloon keeper, who
was set upon and beaten by a gang of
roughs at Pacific and Kearny streets a
short time ago, died in the French Hos
pital yesterday morning. Shortly after
the death was reported to Captain Bo
hen he detailed Policemen McMahon and
Fowle to arrest the assailants. Last
night they arrested two young men
named Frank Jackson and James McDon
ough. on suspicion of being implicated
in the assault. They will be held pend
ing further investigation. The police have
thus far been unable to establish the
identity of the man who purloined
Lacazette's gold watch, as he lay uncon
scious in the Harbor Hospital. Fearing
arrest the thief returned the watch by
mail. Captain Bohen is satisfied that
he knows the man who robbed the help
less saloon keeper, but for lack of evi
dence he does not intend to arrest him.
A Thieving Packer.
George Ryan, a packer in the ware
house of Wangenheim, Sternheim & Co.,
was yesterday sentenced by Judge Con
lan to eighteen months in the County
Jail, being six months on each of three
charges of petty larceny. Ryan had been
systematically stealing from his employ
ers, and Detective Harper found that he
had been selling the stolen articles to
Aaron Crocker, a pawnbroker.

PURE FOOD MOVE
TO BE WIDESPREAD
ITS PROMOTERS WXLL FIGHT
FOR A COMMISSION.
Official Body "Will See the Laws Are
Fulfilled in the Interior Towns
as Well as Here.
The first move toward making the pufe
foods agitation a State matter was made
\ yesterday in the rooms of the Manufac
turers' and Producers' Association in the
Mills building. The pure foods commit
tee of that body called a meeting of the
directors, the Board of Health and sev- j
eral who have been prominent in the |
cause. Those responding were A. Sbar
boro, president of the organization; J. W.
Kerr, chairman of the committee; Direc
tors Charles H. Crocker, Samuel McKee,
Charles R. Allen, J. P. Currier. Inspector
J. P. Dockery. Edmund Godchaux, secre
tary of the State Board of Health, and
Drs. Baum and J. M. Williamson, of the
same State body.
President Sbarboro stated that the ob
ject of the gathering was to take steps
on the line of having the next Legisla
ture enact- laws in the interests of pure
foods that will effect the whole State,
As it is now the only people who seem
to be interested are the Manufacturers'
I and Producers' Association, the Board of
! Health and a few others. Outside of the
city no attention is paid to these laws
and when the local officers attempt to
have them put into operation In the coun
try they are met with opposition. This
was shown in the attempts of Inspector
Dockery when he went outside of San
Francisco to prevent impure milk from
being sent here.
Chairman Kerr, in his report of the
good work done in this cause, said it
should be extended all over the State. I
As it is now when a certain line or brand j
of impure or adulterated goods is con
demned in this city they are sent to some
of the other cities and there sold, as they
had been here. He said there are two
propositions to be considered, the health
of the people first and the commercial in
terest next. In California the finest fruit
jams, jellies and preserves of the world
are made. These in their unadulterated
condition command the best of prices in
the markets of the Old World. People
who have no wish to maintain the. good
name of the State Have been adulterating
these articles until the products of Call
fornia are no longer in demand. I
Upon Mr. Kerr's motion the pure foods <
committee was authorized to confer with .
Attorney J. J. Dunne and the Board of <
Health with a view to making the move- j
ment a State affair and having some kind
of commission provided for, whose duties *
it shall be to see the laws carried out in j
all parts of the State. Mr. Godchaux
Dr, Williamson and Dr. Baum, as well *
as the others present, thought it would j
be an excellent idea, and a special meet- ,
ing will be called within a short time to *
further discuss the best means of carry- S
ing out the propositions suggested.
Death of Professor Packard.
A dispatch was received from New lork
yesterday announcing the death of Pro
fessor S. S. Packard, well known as one
of the leading business educators of the
wcrld. Until his death Professor Packard
was the principal of the leading business
college in the State of New York, and
during his career of forty years as such
has graduated some of the most eminent
men of the Empire State. The Packard
Alumni Association, which was founded
in ISB2, was welcomed into existence by
such distinguished speakers as Chauncey
M. Depew, Chief Justice Davis, Bishop
Newman and others. Professor Packard 3
70th birthday was celebrated a year or
two ago by a notable public demonstra
tion. He was the recipient of handsome
testimonials from the business colleges of
the United States. He was/ a man or
strong personality and few men have been
more instrumental in developing the com
mercial branches of education.
The Heinrichs To-Night.
The sixth of the delightful Heinrich re
citals will take place at Sherman & Clay
Hall this evening. Mr. Heinrich will sing
the "Erl King." and the programme will
be one of the best that these artists have
yet rendered here.
