HIS SILENCE
NOT WORTH
THE PRICE
Tf)e Southero Pacific Compaoy
BalKed at William R.
Hearst's Blackmail.
Documents That Demonstrate the Danger of
Private *ln)morality in Public Affairs.
The Secret Compact.
The Call has given to the public of
Ban Francisco a plain story of plain
facts in reference to William R. Hearst
and the newspaper vehicle through
â¢which he levies tribute upon this com
munity. As a further evidence of its
faith to the people of San Francisco
The Call publishes this morning a fac
Bimile of the original secret agreement
in which Hearst deluded a powerful
corporation into an absurd belief that
he, even as a blackmailer, would re
main bought.
The document thus published repre
sent? something more than an affair of
passing interest. It demonstrates to
the people of the State that the single
remaining shibboleth of the Examiner,
the cry of "Railroad, Railroad, in poli
tics," is dictated and voiced in the
Southern Pacific building.
William R. Hearst valued his honor
and his paper's silence at $30,000. The
public is certainly at liberty to Judge
-whether the silence of the paper or the
honor of its proprietor was worth the
price. But the railroad officials agreed
to pay the money and William R.
Hearst accepted it and with it the
stamp of dishonor that decent people
Will place upon such a transaction.
In a puerile effort to evade the con
sequences of his bargain William R.
Hearst resorts to a personal abuse of
those that exposed his infamy. He for
got that personalities are dangerous
"weapons in such hands as his own, but
he remembered, with a coward's confi
dence, that there are some facts in
some persons' history that a decent
newspaper cannot publish. The Call,
in justice to itself and to its readers,
cannot discuss Mr. Hearst as a person.
The Call is concerned only in pre- i
senting to the public the facts that
prove William R. Hearst a blackmailer
an ! his aewÂ«papei a cheap subsidized â 
ag'-nt ul a corporation that has given j
to the Examiner a cheap notoriety, j
The facts may be briefly stated. Wil
liam R. Hearst sold whatever position j
he may occupy among decent people |
for $30,000. He sold his personal honor !
and asked in the sale only one ion
cession, that his purchaser would not
expose his shame to the community
upon which he imposed.
' In his secret contract with the South
ern Pacific Company Hearst stipulated
that his newspaper and his para
sites would indulge only in
**sucu criticism as may be
found necessary to keep and
maintain the confidence of the
public. 4*4 * Hearst promised more.
He was bought not only to silence what
the Southern Pacific people believed to
be a malignant tongue and a malicious
influence, but to open at the same time
the columns of his newspaper to what
ever railroad officials cared to print.
Mr. Hearst, through the medium of
one of his employes, has declared that
The Call delayed the expose of his
shame, until two of the parties to his
blackmailing exaction were dead.
Charles F. Crocker and A. N. Towne
are dead, but William R. Hearst is
alive. He was the blackmailer and they
his victims. They need no more de
fense for their conduct than a way
farer who is halted on the road by a
highwayman and throws up his hands.
The history of Hearst's blackmail is
interesting. For a long period preced
ing 1892 the Examiner had persistently
assaulted the Southern Pacific Com
pany with deliberate misrepresentation.
The corporation felt , itself powerless
under the attacks unless it bribed
Hearst and his newspaper to silence
their malignity. A conference was held
and a compact was made. Hearst
wanted money, and the Southern Pa
cific was eager to give it for fair treat
ment.
Agents of the Southern Pacific Com
pany and employes of William R.
Hearst met in consultation. There was
some haggling over terms. Hearst had
placed himself on sale and wanted the
best price he could obtain. His pur
chasers sought to drive a bargain, and,
as was proved by subsequent corre
spondence, whi^h The Call publishes
this morning, th.; Southern Pacific Com
pany made the most of its predicament.
It exacted from Hearst the privilege of
using the columns of his newspaper as
well as locking his tongue for thirty
months.
At that time Hearst, through his
authorized agents, promised in con
sideration of $30,000 to give the railroad
and its interests immunity from un
warranted abuse. The columns of the
Examiner were opened for what the
railroad pleased to say. A bogus quar
rel with the 'Southern Pacific was to be
maintained to delude the public, but
the railroad was Insured, as far as a
blackmailer's promise may insure,
against material criticism.
Hearst declares that when the secret
contract was made he was in Egypt,
dozing on the banks of the Nile and
striving to read the secret of the
Sphinx. But when he returned, how
ever, he hypothecated to a local bank
his blackmail demand, sanctioned the
extortion of his employes and pocketed
the ill-gotten gains of their labors as
the price of his dishonor.
It has been said that sometimes there
is not honor even among thieves. Wil
liam R. Hearst had been bought but he
refused to remain bought. He violated
the conditions of the compact that his
agents had made and that he, over his
own signature, had indorsed. The con
tract is now public property. When it
was made there was, as already indi
cated, a heated discussion of terms.
Some indication of this is given in the
â written statement of A. N. Towne, who
wrote across the face of the contract:
*'AÂ» I'rÂ«"in<*Â«iil>*Â»r i Â«tie tntlc the
nlÂ»ovÂ«Â» cover* Ihe nndcrKtnnd.
in <r fully. V
This was . Mr. Towne's emphatic , as
sertion that no clause in the compact
The San Francisco Call
! was to be rejected by William K.
Hearst or his employes, One of Hearst s
! agents, who was present at the confer
! ence, objected to the railroad's demand
that it was "to enjoy immunity from
i hostility in the columns of the Exam
! iner." Charles F. Crocker, W. H. Mills
! and A. N. Towne insisted upon such an
j immunity or declined to pay the trib
ute. The matter was thoroughly dis
i cussed and Hearst's agent, who is now
I one of his employes, made his objec-
I tion and was overruled. Thirty thou
sand dollars is not obtained every day
for one's employer, and F. H. Gassa-
I way, the Hearst agent who objected,
j was willing to be overruled.
The contract was therefore made and
signed. Another compact was prepared
and given to W. R. Hearst to protect
him in his shame against the lash of
public condemnation. Both of these
documents The Call has published.
These papers prove on their face that
the secret agreement was made four
teen days before the public imposition
was penned. The conferences had
ended when the secret compact was
signed. The Southern Pacific Company
had submitted to Hearst's blackmail.
The proprietor of the Examiner was
bought. A time lock had been set upon
his tongue. The money was already on
the way to his purse. Only one detail
in the transaction had not received at
tention. The public was to be deceived,
and on June 29, 1892, the absurd â¢'ad
vertising" contract was penned.
After the contract was signed the
Southern Pacific was not slow to de
mand what :'t had bought. Malice and
malignity were to oe silence;! and the
columns of the Examiner were to be
opened for the presentation of Southern
Pacific interests as Southern Pacific
people saw these interests. Hearst had
promised to silence his tongue and give
the railroad the right to present itself
as it pleased in the columns of the Ex
aminer.
In accordance with that demand and
with the knowledge that William R.
Hearst had become the purchased chat
tel of the Southern Pacific Company
WHliara-HrMllis wrote as follows:

March 24, '93.
I gave to Mr. C. M. Palmer
copy of an article written
by J. A. Woodson with the
understanding that if the
agreement heretofore made
with the Examiner was re

Examiner.
I have delivered to Mr. F.
H. Cassaway this morning
copy, with illustrations, for
an article, which, if the con
tract heretofore entered in
to with the Examiner had
been pursued according to
its terms, would have been
one of the articles contrib
uted. The copy heretofore
given and given this day is
with the understanding that
if the directory instructs me
to abrogate the contract the
copy given is not to preju
dice the case, but is to be
given as copy which the
Examiner can use as its
own, and is not to be con
strued an order to publish
the copy.
Signed, W. H. MILLS.
This also applies to pho
tographs and cuts furnished
to us.
Signed,
THE EXAMINER,
By C. M. PALMER, Busi
ness Manager.
When C. M. Pajmer indorsed this de
mand that was at the same time a
threat he was an authorized agent of
William R. Hearst and one of the most
trusted employes of the Examiner. Mr.
Palmer knew what he was doing and
saw that rebellion to such a demand
meant a loss of what remained unpaid
on the blackmail contract.
The Southern Pacific Company and
the Examiner for many months had a
community of interests. The well-being
of both demanded friendliness. Hearfet
did not dare quarrel as the railroad of
ficials had in their possession his signa
ture as the proof of hia shame. The
Southern Pacific did not dare venture
a breech as the Examiner wan still in
a position to resume its character as a
public blackguard.
But as the months went by the
Southern Pacific Company grew bold.
It insisted that Hearst had violated his
contract. He had been bought to be
decent and then refused to be pur
chased for that purpose. H. E. Hunt
ington became aniry, and the monthly
Installments on the blackmail contract
ceased. Young Huntington explained
the reason and took no pains to insin
uate his meaning. He was dealing with
ppople who understood facts by their
true names, and wrote as follows:
H. E. HUNTINOTON TO T. T. WIL
LIAMS, SEPTEMBER 27, 1894.

! was to receive certain advertising 1 and
also fair treatment at the hands of the
paper. There can be no question that
the chief consideration to inure to the
Southern Pacific Company in this trans
action was the fair treatment to be ac
j corded by your paper, that it would not
have entered into an agreement to pay
[ $30,000 for advertising merely, as the
i benefit to accrue from such advertising
alone was grossly inadequate to the sum
of money involved. It is now assumed
j on behalf of the Examiner that the ques
tion of fair treatment is one which could
be determined by the Examiner manage
ment only, and could not possibly be a
question of debate or arbitration. You
Bay to admit otherwise would be to sur
i render the entire disposition of your busi
ness into the hands of your customers.
Of course, if Mr. Hearst had not under
taken by contract to accord to the com
pany fair treatment he would undoubtedly

: his paper should take concerning the com
pany and its interests, but when he chose
to enter into an agreement that in con
sideration of a large sum of money to he
paid to him the Examiner would accord
to the company fair treatment, he neces-
Barily, under all business rules of fair
dealing, submitted himself as to this
question of fair treatment to the decision
of an impartial arbitrator or tribunal, in
case any dispute should arise on this point
between the parties. This contract was
mutual in Its character, and both
parties to it should be protected.
The Southern Pacific might as well in
sist that it has the sole right to determine
whether or not it would make the pay
| ments stipulated in this contract as for
Mr. Hearst to insist that he has the sole
right tv determine the question as to
whether or not he performed the cove
nants on his part. A fair analysis of this
case can yield no other result than that
the parties were equal In the contract:
that the arbitrary right to determine
whether the money had been earned and
should be paid was not left with the
Southern Pacific Company, nor was the
arbitrary right to determine whether the
consideration had been rendered on the
part of the Examiner left to Mr. Hearst's
sole determination.
I do not understand you as insisting
that it was improper for Mr. Hearst to
make the fair treatment to be accorded

Special Dispatch to The Call.
HAVANA. Oct. 22 (via Jacksonville.
Fla., Oct. 24).â Captain General Blanco,
after a consultation with his officers,
has defied the Governments at Madrid
and "Washington, and it may be that
a renewal of hostilities will be neces
: by his paper to the Southern Pacific Gom
pnny a subject of contract between-him
; self and the company. During the nego
! tiation which led to this contract it was
i not suggested nor Intimated that Mr.
â  Hearst would solely and arbitrarily de
termine all questions as to such fair
treatment. It is unfortunate that this po
1 sition was not taken in the negotiations
''â  which led up to this contract. Had we
been apprised of such intention on the
part of Mr. Hearst it is not likely that
; the contract proposed would have been
! entered into by us.
William R. Hearst cannot quibble on
the meaning of this letter. The terms
of H. E. Huntington speak for them
selves. W. R. Hearst and his news
i paper had been bought and the South
: crn Pacific Company intended to enjoy
i the benefits of its purchase or to re
pudiate the price. When Huntington
: penned his letter of censure he cvi
i der.tly did not know that William R.
I Hearst had a new grievance. The pro
i prietor of the "Monarch" felt that an
insult had been thrust upon him. He
1 had been eager to be purchased. He
had fixed his price and the Southern
! Pacific Company accepted it as reason
able. Southern Pacific officials had
agreed that $30,000 was a fair sum with
which to silence a lying tongue. And
William R. Hearst placed himself on
the market at their valuation.
It is one thing to be bought and an
! other, however, to have the public
know it. William R. Hearst was stung
' by the fact that Irving M. Scott knew
i of the shame of the proprietor of the
i Examiner. The great ship builder was
i informed of the private purchase of
! Hearst and mentioned the fact. Hearst
thought nothing of the sale of his honor
but he shrunk from the fact that the
sale was known.
One of his agents T. T. Williams,
! formerly an employe of William M.Neil
! son, hastened to his master's assist
ance and in answer to Huntington's
chiding, wrote the following letter:
W. R. Hearst, by T. T. Williams, to H.
sary before American sovereignty in
Cuba is established. Blanco early on
Friday received telegraphic instruc
tions from the Spanish Ministry to turn
the Government of Cuba over to the
Americans on December 1, should the
treaty of peace have been signed by
that date, even though the complete
evaluation of the Island by Spanish
troops may not have been wholly ef
fected. After a consultation with his
staff and a hasty council of war, BlancÂ«
sent the following response in code per
the French cable via Hayti:
"HAVANA, Oct. 21.â Hasta que no se
les pafue les muchos meses que se le I
debe no embarcara guarniclon Ha- !
bana. Ni permito que los Americanos
tomen posesion hasta que haya embar
cada todo el ejercito. Resistare.
BLANCO."
This message, which was addressed
to Sagasta, President of the Council at ,
Madrid, is translated into English as
follows:
"HAVANA, Oct. 21.â Until they shall
have been paid many months' salary
which we owe them, I will not embark
the Havana garrison. Nor will I per
mit the Americans to take possession
until the entire Spanish army be em
barked. I shall resist. BLANCO."
Spain owes her troops here six to
eight months' pay, amounting to $12,
000,000 or $15,000,000, besides some $6,000,
000 or ?7 000,000 due contractors and
civil employes. And yet in response to
Blanco's repeated and urgent appeals
for money, made almost daily since the
Washington protocol was signed, the
home Government has remitted him
but the pitiful sum of $3,000,000, and
this came in silver. Under the Spanish
law national troops and volunteers are
required to be paid in gold. The money
Sagasta sent here reduced to gold
would be worth hardly $1,500,000, or a
E. Huntlngton, September 29, 1894:
â¢ â¢ â¢ You say, "The Southern Pacific
might as well Insist that it has the sole
right to determine whether or not it
would make the payments stipulated.'
Now, my dear Mr. Huntington, that is
exactly what you have done. Without
any notice to us whatsoever you in
formed the clerk of the First National
Bank that you would not pay any more
on that contract; the reason for refus
ing to pay it was that the Examiner had
failed to keep its agreement to treat you
in a certain way, and you even
went so far as to point out on
the contract to Mr. Murphy, then
cashier of the First National Bank, the
clause which you claim covered that
thing. Of course when I say "you" I
do not mean you personally. I mean your
people or agents. Furthermore, your peo
ple did what I consider anything but a
proper, courteous thing when they dis
cussed our business with the clerk of a bank
where we deposit. A few days ago while
talking with Irving M. Scott he Informed
me that the Examiner was in receipt
of a subsidy from the Southern Pacific,
to wit: the sum of $1000 per month paid
monthly for thirty months, and he stated
that the time was arranged to
cover two sessions of the Legis
lature. He had the most intimate
knowledge of the matter under discus
sion, down to the smallest details, which
he could only have received from some
one high In the counsels of the Southern
Pacific. Without notice to us, without
explanation and without recognition of
any right except your own pleasure, for
a period of more than forty days, you
kept silent on this subject except as to
the communication made to a third party
not interested. If this is not an assump
tion that you had the right to determine
the matter I am very much mistaken.
But very little else remains to tell
the story of the purchase of William R.
Hearst. The facts merit publication,
simply to illustrate the danger of pri
vate immorality in public affairs. If
the proprietor of the Examiner cares to
know, The Call will also tell to the pub
lic the part that the Examiner played
in the conspiracy that wrecked the Pa
cific Bank.
mere drop in the bucket, considering
the sum owed. Riots would have
broken out days ago but for the cur
rent customs receipts, which have aid
ed Captain General Blanco in pacifying
his soldiers.
The situation is now becoming most
critical. The troops supported by all
the higher army chiefs refuse either to
deliver up their arms or to return to
Spain, unless their demands for money
be met, nor will they allow Blanco him
self to leave Havana unless he first
pays them their just dues. The Cap
tain General can do nothing to appeaie
the army unless Madrid supplies him
with the necessary funds.
The Government trick suggested by
Premier Sagasta, whereby the bulk of
the Spanish forces in Cuba were to be
mustered out of the service and aban
doned here, did not work. The men
would gladly accept relief from further
military obligations to the crown and
save the Government the expense of
transportation to the peninsula, but be
fore giving up their arms they want
their pay, and unless they get it there
will be trouble.
Owing to the rigid censorship it has
been impossible for correspondents of
American newspapers to send the truth
concerning the condition of affairs in
Havana. It is known that Blanco is
stripping the city and adjacent prov
inces of property that, under the terms
of the protocol, should revert to the
United States, and against which the
American Commission has protested, but
the protests have been disregarded.
Complaint has been made to Washing
ton, but so far as appears on the sur
face here nothing has been done to
check Blanco. The latter is now re
garded as ready to revolt and attempt
to establish himself as dictator. The
army in its present state of mind will
follow him to a man. The Htepano-
American war is not yet ended.

AGREE TO RETIRE
FROM FASHODA?
It Is Reported That tt)e Paris
GovernmeQt H as Decided
to Recede.
Great Britain Issues a Reply to tbe "Yellow"
BooK and Continues the WarliKe
Preparations.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Oct. 24.â The Paris corre
spondent of the Daily Chronicle claims
to have authority to say a decision has
already been taken by the French Gov
ernment speedily to evacuate Fashoda,
and that M. del Casse, the French For
eign Minister, will do his utmost to
facilitate a solution.
The Fashoda yellow book issued by
the French Government having left
some slight misgivings in this country
as to Lord Salisbury's firmness in deal
ing with the French Embassador,
Baron de Courcel, a speedy dissipation
of these fears followed the publication
of yesterday's blue book. It is specially
Welcomed by the London papers, which
this morning express their satisfaction,
notably at the view of the Egyptian^
Regent, which is held to nullify entirely 1
the French idea that England lacks
the approval of the Egyptian Govern
ment.
The Times says: "Lord Salisbury's
version of the interview with Baron de
Courcel is decidedly a dispatch to re
lieve the British mind."
The Standard says: "The blue book
removes apprehensions regarding Lord
Salisbury's position which it would
have been unsafe to leave uncorrected."
The Daily News thinks the blue book
confirms the impression left by the yel
low book, namely that France is seek
ing a loophole.
ENGLAND ISSUES A
SECOND BLUE BOOK
LONDON, Oct. 24.â The British Gov
ernment will issue another blue book
to-night, the most important feature of
which will be a dispatch dated October
12, from the Marquis of Salisbury to the
Entbassador at Paris, Sir Edmund Mon
son, reporting the previous interview
with Baron de Courcel, in which the
latter wished to ascertain what solu
tion of the question was possible. In
this dispatcth the Marquis of Salis
bury says:
"I gently insisted that the Nile Valley
had belonged and still belonged to
Egypt, and that whatever diminution
that title had suffered by the Mahdi's
conquest had been remove 1 by the
victory at Omdurman."
The Marquis of Salisbury then point
ed out the helolessness of Major
Marchand's position, which Baron de
Courcel denied, and finally the British
Premier, in response to Baron de Cour
cel's suggestion, offered to supply
Major Marchand with food and ammu
nition in order that he might be able to
reach French territory.
Baron de Courcel then said France
wanted an outlet to the Nile, and the
Marquis of Salisbury requested that
the whole proposition be made in writ-
ing:.
This was the last interview between
the Embassador and the Premier on the
subject. Baron de Courcel then went
to Paris and it is thought that the
proposition which he brings to-night
embodies the points indicated in this
conversation.
The British Cabinet council has been
fixed for Thursday next.
The Salisbury dispatch in conclusion
said: "The extreme indeflniteness of
Baron de Courcel's proposition made it
impossible for me to express or form
an opinion relative to the territory
claimed by France in the Bahr-el-
Ghazal region. Under the circum
stances the discussion has been fruitful
of misapprehension. I informed him
that it was in no way my duty to dis
cuss the French claims now, but that In
abstaining therefrom I must not be un
derstood as in any degree admitting
their validity."
The blue book also contains interest
ing letters from Mustapha, the Regent
of Egypt, to General Kitchener and
Lord Cromer, the British diplomatic
agent, respectively, showing Egypt's
attitude. He wrote to General Kitch
ener warmly thanking him for taking
possession of Fashoda and thereby re
conquering for Egypt the provinces
which assure her existence, and from
which she only retired provisionally.
The Regent in writing to Lord
Cromer protested against "the French
violation of Egyptian territory," adding
that Egypt had never lost sight of the
reoccupation of the province of the
Soudan, which are the actual sources
of the vitality of Egypt and from which
she only withdrew owing to force. He
also said that the reconquest of Khar
toum would fail to have its effect if the
valley of the Nile was not restored to
Egypt-
Mustapha concluded with referring
to the Anglo-French discussion on the
subject of Fashoda, urging Lord
Cromer to use his good offices with the
Marquis of Salisbury "in order that the
incontestable rights of Egypt may be
recognized and that all provinces occu
pied up the rebellion of Mohammed
Abmed to be restored to her."
FRANCE MAY RECEIVE
SOME SATISFACTION
LONDON, Oct. 24.â The afternoon
papers here to-day discuss the report
of the French Embassador, Baron de
Courcel, on the subject of the conver
sation here with the Marquis of Salis
bury regarding the proposed French
outlet on the Nile, as being the leading
feature of the yellow book on the Fash
oda question, issued yesterday by the
French Government. The Conservative
organs scout the idea of the Marquis
of Salisbury entertaining the surrender
of Bahr-el-Ghazal to the French, and
the Pall Mall Gazette and the Globe
suggest that the Embassador misunder
stood the Premier, and call on the lat
ter to make some explanation.
The Liberal and Radical papers are
not displeased at the prospect of a
compromise being arranged, and they
believe that, provided Major Marchand

is recalled, the dispute is susceptible of
an arrangement by which France will
receive some satisfaction in the Bahr
el-Ghazal district.
PREPARATIONS DUE TO THE
STRAINED RELATIONS
VICTORIA, B. C. Oct. 24.â The
preparations at Esquimalt, the naval
depot of the Northern Pacific squadron,
continue unabated. An air of activity
pervades all departments. The Amph
ion, which, it was understood, would
not go into drydock until after another
steamer already booked had been dealt
with, received instructions to-day from
the admiral of the fleet to commence
the necessary work immediately and
she entered the drydock. The officers
do not deny that the preparations now
going on are due to the strained rela
tions of France and England.
ADMIRALTY ISSUES
SIGNIFICANT ORDERS
LONDON, Oct. 24.â The Britsh Ad
miralty issued a number of significant
orders this morning. The dockyards at
Portsmouth, Devenport and Chatham
have each received instructions to pre
pare six thirty-knot torpedo boat de
stroyers for commissioning so that they
will be able to put to sea in twenty-four
hours. Overtime hours have begun on
the first-class cruisers Europa and An
dromeda, so as to hurry them for sea
service. Several gunboats in the dif
ferent dockyards have been ordered to
postpone unnecessary fitting. Finally,
the Cunard Line and White Star Line
have received word from the Admiralty
to hold their subsidized steamers in
readiness for turning over to the naval
officials.
INDICATIONS OF THE
APPROACHING CONFLICT
DALLAS, Tex., Oct. 24.â Cotton buy
ers of Dallas this afternoon received
cables from foreign customers ordering
them to make all future shipments
subject to war risks. Walter Glazener,
who buys for houses in Havre and
Liverpool, said to the Herald corre
spondent concerning the cables he had
received: "This indicates to my mind
that war between England and France
is sure to begin soon. Buyers in this
country may be embarrassed on pur
chases already made, as we cannot say
what the war risk will be. They may
be 1 per cent or they may be 2 per cent,
possibly more than the last mentioned
figure."
LIVERPOOL, Oct. 24.â Higher rates
are being demanded for cargoes to
French ports, and some ship owners
have refused such cargoes. The aver
age increase is 3d to 2s 6d per ton on
the net register. It is reported that
several large vessels have been engaged
on French account to load grain at
American ports.
FRANCE AND THE
OUTLET ON THE NILE
PARIS, Oct. 24.â The newspapers
here to-day warmly praise the exposi
tion of the French side of the Fashoda
question presented by the Minister of
Foreign Affairs, M. del Casse, in the
yellow book on the subject, issued yea-
t prd&v
The Figaro says: "I* the British
Government rejects France's moderate
and just proposals, it can only be be
cause the Government of Great Brit
ain desires before anything else the hu
miliation of France."
The general tone of the French press
comments is reflected by the Eclair,
which remarks: "An agreement re
garding Fashoda can be arrived at pro
vided Great Britain does not persist in
asking for the immediate recall of
Major Marchand. But, as to an out
let on the Nile, we have an absolute
right thereto, and will brook no re
fusal." ____________
MUST STOP THE '
SALE OF CANNON
NEW YORK, Oct. 24.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
I was informed to-day on high author
ity that as a result of consultations be
tween the President and his Cabinet
the Secretary of State was directed to
send a note to the French Embassy, ex
plaining that this Government could
not permit the sale of cannon or the
removal of guns from the fortifications
of Cuba, as reported by the American
Commissioners, and that such proceed
ings must be stopped at once. This
note was at once cabled to Paris by
M. Eugene Thiebault, First Secretary
and Charge d'Affaires of the French
Embassy, where it will be transmitted
to the French Embassador in Madrid
who will present it to Senor Sagasta.
So far as the dispatch of warships is
concerned, I was told to-day the Presi
dent feels that such action at this
time, while peace negotiations are in
progress, would be injurious, but such
action will be taken if the Spanish
Government fails to heed the protest
which has been made.
On the same authority I can say that
the American Commissioners have ac
cepted the proposition made by the
Spanish Commissioners that January 1
be decided on aÂ« the final evacuation of
the island by Sfaanish troops.
The President is determined Decem
ber 1 shall be the date when the United
States shall assume possession of tbÂ«
civil administration of Cuba.2
AGAINST THE
JOINT TRAFFIC
ASSOCIATIONS
U. S. Supreme Court
Decision.
ANTI-TRUST LAW VIOLATORS
A MENACE TO COMMERCE AND
TRADE.
Justice Peckham Announces the
Opinion Which Reverses That
of the Lower Federal
Courts.
to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 24.â The United
States Supreme Court to-day decided
the Joint Traffic Association case in fa
vor of the United States and against
the railroads.
The case was considered one of the
most important that has ever come to
the Supreme Court, not only to the rail
roads but to the general public, and
because of the vast railroad properties
represented by the Traffic Association.
The association was formed on Novem
ber 19, 181)5, by thirty-one railways rep
resenting the great trunk lines and
their network of branches. The pur
pose of the association, as Btated in the
articles of agreement, was "to estab
lish and maintain reasonable and just
rates, fares and regulations on State
and interstate traffic." A similar as-
Bociatlon, on a smaller scale, was
formed among Southwestern roads,
known as the Trans-Missouri Associa
tion.
These associations were soon at
iurts on the ground that
they were in violation of the Sherman
anti-trust law, and also of the inter
state commerce law. The Trans-
Missouri first reached the United
- Supreme Court where, in a not
able opinion, iho court held that the
i.itiuii was iile^iil, being' in effect
a combination In restraint of trade and
commerce, and therefore violatlve of
:ti-trust law. This opinion was
by a divided bench, the division being
rery close, viz. : Chief Justice Fuller
ana Justices Harian, Becker, Brown
and Peckham holding the Traffic Asso
ciation illegal, while Justices Field,
pray, Shiras and White filed a dissent
ing opinion upholding the association.
!i after this decision Justice Field
gave place to Justice McKenna. Al
though the Missouri ensf was consid
ered somewhat of a test, yet the Joint
Traffic Ass iciation prepared to make a
stubborn contest in support of its ex
istence. The case against it was be
gun on January 7, lk l jt>, in the United
States Circuit Court for the Southern
District of New York, the United
States being complainant and the At
torn. L ; directing its course.
The case went against the Government
in the lower courts, the Circuit Court
dismissing th>- bill and the Court of Ap
peals affirming th^ dismissal.
The Government appealed to the
United State's Supreme Court. An ex
ceptionally brilliant array of counsel
ared for the association, including
nator Edmunds, James C. Carter
and E. J. Phelps. Solicitor General
Richards filed the brief for the Gov
ernment. The main contention of the
rnment was thai tile traffic agree
ment is a combination to prevent com
petition, thus a contract in
restraint of trade or commerce. The
answer of the association maintained
the legality of the agreement on tho
ground that the vast needs of com
merce require joint action, and that
such action insm-es uniform and just
rates and prevents secret and unjust
discriminations.
Justice Peckham announced the de
cision. He said that the court could
distinguish no difference between this
and the trans-MissourJ case
igo against the railroads. He
the only new point Involved was as to
the constitutionality of the anti-trust
act. The court had reached the con
clusion that as railroad corporations
performed duties of a semi-public char
acter it was within the constitutional
power of Congress to regulate them as
provided by the anti-trust act. The
only question was us to the policy of
Congress in adopting such a measure.
As to questions of policy the court, he
said, had nothing- to do.
The opinion, which was very brief,
was concurred in by Chief Justice Ful
ler and Justices Harlan, Brewer. Brown
and Peckham. Justices Gray, Bhiras
and White dissented. Justice McKen
na took no part in the case, as the pros
ecution of the Joint Traffic Association
was begun while he was Attorney Gen
eral.
After Justice Peckham had an
nounced the opinion Justice Harlan
verbally expressed, with some evidence
of satisfaction, his concurrence on the
same ground, he said, as that set forth
in the trans-Missouri case. Under the
decision of to-day the decision of the
United States Circuit Court for the
Southern District of New York and of
the United States Court of Appeals,
both of which were favorable to the
Joint Traffic Association, are reversed.
Justice Peckham also announced the
court's opinion in cases against the
Kansas City Live fitnnk Exchange op
erating at Kansas City and Weston,
Mo. The Government prosecuted under
the anti-tru.Â«t law. The Supreme Court
holds that the association does not
come under the anti-trust law. Justice
Harlan in a dissenting opinion declared
that such combinations were rings or
syndicates which, if extended to oil,
sugar, salt, lumber and other staples
would place the commerce of the coun
try in control of a few rings and syn
dicates.

STEAMER PROTECTION
ARRIVES AT SEATTLE
Brings Seventy Passengers and Lit
tle Gold From St. Michael.
Portland on the Way.
SEATTLE, Oct. 24.â The steamer Pro
tection, the next to the last vessel to
leave St. Michael, Alaska, this season,
arrived to-night with seventy passengers
and a small amount of gold dust. The
last vessel to leave St. Michael is the
pu-amer Portland, which was to have
Bailed October 10 for San Francisco.
Only two sailing vessels were at Dutch
Harbor, the Wachusetts and the NÂ«l
mith. When the Protection left St. Mi
chael the Yukon River was still open
something unprecedented this late In tne
season. The last steamer to arrive at
St. Michael from Dawson was the T. . b .
Powers. She brought no passengers. The
steamer P. W. Weare was reported
aground on a sandbar near Russian Mis
sion. She will probably remain there all
winter. __. . ,
News has been received at St. Michael
that the steamer Abble Rowe was not
wrecked, a* has been reported, but nad
reached Golofin Bay. She was three
w- eks overdue. The delay was caused by
the breaking down of her machinery.
PROTOCOL HAS MADE
MANY CUBAN PATRIOTS
HAVANA, Cyiba, Oct. 24.â The Span
ish and American f ommissioners ex
changed documents to-day, all relat
ing to routine matters. In regard to
the sale of bronze guns, I am informed
by General Parrado that no final de
cision has been received from Wash
ington.
The French transport Cherebon left
to-day with eighty officers and 900 sol
diers for Cadiz. The transports now
here will carry nearly 400 troops from
Gibara this week.
Captain Page and Major Almy went
to <'ienfuegos to-day' to see what was
troubling the insurgents. From all
parts of the island come reports that
the insurgents are becoming restive
and impatient. A significant fact is
that the number of Cuban warriors
now in the field is nearly double the
number to be found when fighting was
going on. In the words of General
Dueasse, "the protocol made many pa
triots." Food is scarce and the ten
sion is trying to the nerves of the men
who expected before this to be enjoy
ing the fruits of victory won by the
Americans. Unless the United States
makes a show of force soon the opin
ion of those best informed is that the
insurgents may precipitate trouble.
For this reason the commission is anx
ious that some warships return to Cu
ban waters. General Butler recently
wrote to the President, explaining the
whole situation and advising that war
ships be sent here, making it possible
to hold the soldiers back until Decem
ber.
STEAMSHIP TACOMA
CHANGES HER REGISTER
Stars and Stripes Replace the Union
Jack â First Ca.se of the Kind
â¢ on the Coast.
TACOMA, Oct. 24.â The steamship Ta
eoma of the Northern Pacific Steam
ship Company was formally transferred
from British to American registry, with
j her home port at Tacoma, to-day. Five
''â  thousand people stood on the ocean dock
to listen to speeches on the significance
of the event and to see the British en
sign lowered and the Stars and Stripes
takf- its p
The change of register is significant.
This Is the lirat time an English vessel
changed from British to American
register on the Pacific Coast ;uid the nrst
time an English flag has been lowered in
these waters.
The steamship Victoria of the Northern
mpany's Tacoma-Oriental neet '
is in port and will be surveyed in a tew
preparatory to changing her regis
ter. All the other vessels of the line are
low.
Permission to assume American registt-r
was granted by Congress last July, but
the English Government forbade the \
transfer, as it might be construed as a
breach of neutrality. With the signing
of the protocol all objection ceased and
the owners of the vessels quickly made
arrangements for securing American reg
ist< r.
It is believed in shipping circles that
the Northern Pacific Steamship Company
is preparing its vessels for the Manila
trade when the Philippine Islands are an
nexed. If the American shipping laws
apply to that trade only vessels flying
tho American flag may engage In the
betwen ports on the Pacific Ocean
and Hawaii and Manila.
AGUINALDO WANTS
TO 60 TO PARIS
The Philippines Leader Prevented
From Attending the Peace Con

MANILA, Oct. 24.â General Rio del
Pelas. who is looked upon as being the
foremost rival of Aguinaldo for the
leadership of the Philippine Insurgents,
has been summoned to Malolos, the In
surgent headquarters, and arrested. The
charge against him is disregarding
A^uinnldo's authority and attempting to
defy the Americans. Agulnaldo has tried
i.i remove several of the Insurgent officers
who are uneducated and unfitted for
their positions, but he has beeivcompelled
to reinstate them. Aguinaldo is desirous
i f tiling to Paris for the purpose of ap
pearing before the Peace Commissioners,
but he is prevented from doing so by the
jealousies existing between the insurgent
leaders.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 25, 1898.
REFUSES TO
ASSUME THE
CUBAN DEBT
Uncle Sam Will Not
Agree.
SPAIN WOULD EXCITE PITY
MAY DECLINE TO PROCEED WITH
PEACE NEGOTIATIONS.
It Is Said the Dons May Even Prefer
a Resumption of Hostilities to
Yielding on the Financial
Propositions.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, Oct. 24.â The American Peace
Commissioners were in session from 10
a. m. until almost 2 p. m., when they
repaired to the joint session. They
took with them a carefully prepared
written answer to the proposals of the
Spaniards regarding Cuba.
Tlii consideration by the .Comrnle
fdoners of Porto Rico and rhe Ladrone
Islands has now been merged with the
Cuban question, and all the points in
volved are being carried forwari to a
simultaneous conclusion.
When this has been arrived at the
Philippine question will be taken up.
Of course there is a possibility oi a dis
agreement, and the Spaniards, if the
American Commissioners decide not to
assume any portion of the Cuban in
debtedness, may announce their un
willingness to proceed any further with
negotiations based upon the protocol.
Should the Spanish decide to do this
it will be because they wish . to . e^"
the pity of their creditors and of other
nations. The Cortes may then be
asked to indorse their action. In lact,
the Spaniards may even prefer a re
sumption Of hostilities to acquiescence
in the American refusal to share their
financial burden.
The Americans, however, have inti
mated to the Spaniards the possibility
that Spain may at some future period
be able to deal with an independent
government regarding the assumption
of the provincial and municipal por
tions of the Cuban debt, which is esti
mated to have been $150,000,000 before
the last rebellion in Cuba broke out
and $500,01)0,000 contracted since 1895.
But, should independent Cuba, as she
doubtless would, refuse to assume
more than her proportion of the debt,
based on actual betterments in Cuba,
and only even in this case of obliga
tions contracted previous to 1895, Spain
would be compelled to appeal to her
people and confront them with prac
tically seven-eighths of the debt con
tracted since. Spain would also be
compelled to declare her inability to
meet her obligations, and this, at pres
ent, seems to the Spainards a more bit
ter alternative than to accept the Uni
ted States refusal to share the Cuban
debt, with all that this means, the idea
being that the Spaniards would be able
to call the attention of their creditor*
to their unyielding though fruitless ef
forts in their behalf.
Finally, it is s;iid that there are per*
sons high in the Spanish councils who
claim to believe that Spain would
rather submit dumbly and helplessly to
decimation or dismemberment than
confront this continual financial bur
den. One course would leave" her pride
unsullied, it is claimed, and the other
is regarded as doubtful, if not Impossi
ble of adoption within the boundaries
of national solvency.
Spain, however, will not break off the
present negotiations before having pro
posed that the United States share half
the insular debt, which in such a prop
osition may be placed at $700,000,000, the
interest rate to be reduced to 2 per cent,
which Spain may hold, practically re
ducing her share to $116,000,000, the por
tion proposed to be borne by the United
States, or guaranteed thereby.
Such a proposition would not be ac
cepted by the United States, either di
rectly or in behalf of Cuba.
The session of the joint commission
began at 2 p. m. and ended at 6:35 p. m.
The adjournment of the joint com
mission was until 4 o'clock in the after
noon of Wednesday next. Guam, in the
Ladrone Islands, has beÂ«-n chosen by
the Americans for the United States
under the terms of the protocol.
The chief matter considered at to
day's session was the American reply
to Spain's revised and renewed propo
sitions of the last meetings, and the
indications are that the Cuban ques
tion will be disposed of this week. But
no details have been given out by either
side regarding Spain's presentment of
Friday last, or the American traverse
of the same submitted to-day.
MADRID, Oct. 24.â The Imparcial to
day says: "No victor ever treated the
vanquished as the United States is
treating Spain. The Government has
received a grave dispatch from Porto
Rico, announcing that the American
general there Is acting toward Spain
as the European nations have treated
China. He ordered a Spanish steamer
to embark the remainder of the Span
ish troops at Porto Rico in spite of the
protests of her captain, who had or
ders to go to Havana to embark sick
soldiers. Our Government will proba
bly protest against such action."

neer Harry Davis, killed; Fireman
Hugh Berry, badly injured; five can.
denfolished, twelve head of cattle killed
and many more injured, and he rail
road track torn up for a distance of
several hundred feet was the result of
the rails of the Southern Pacific spread
ing late yesterday afternoon near Ca
mulos. .
A special Sunday night freight train
of twelve cars, four containing cattle,
one oil car, two cars filled with hay
and the rest empty, was sweeping
down the Santa Clara River valley
from Saugus, coming toward Santa
Barbara. Five miles east of Camulos
the train reached a sharp curve to the
right, on the top of a high embank
ment. Suddenly the train came to a
stop, and the conductor and brakeman
jumping out found the engine lying on
its side with an oil tank car reared over
it, several cars piled up behind and in
the ruins the body of Harry Davis, the
engineer. As they stood there Fireman
Hugh Berry crawled out from under
the wreck, suffering from a broken leg,
a broken hip, ribs and internal injuries.
He was also badly scalded by the boil
ing water and steam which poured on
him from the engine boiler. It is be
lieved that when the engine left the
track Engineer Davis closed the throt
tle and put on the emergency airbrake.
He then jumped, landing all right, but
was struck immediately afterward by
the tender and oil tank car, which must
have passed completely over him. He
received a blow on the chest which
killed him instantly. The fireman
stayed in the engine and went over
with it. His escape from death is lit
tle less than miraculous.
A train hand was sent to flag ap
proaching- trains and to wire to Saugus
for an extra engine. At about that
time the incoming passenger train had
entered Saugus and immediately the
engine was sent to the wreck and took
back the dead* engineer and wounded
fireman.
Harry Davis was 35 years old and an
engineer of long experience. He was '
single and lived with hl3 sister. Miss
Helen W. Davis, and his brother at 109
West Ann street, Los Angeles.
Hugh Berry, the fireman, is married.
He lives at 117 East Elmyra street, Los
Angeles.

Exciting Ball Game at Vallejo.
VALLEJO, Oct. 24.â The ball game at
Trulls Park Sunday drew the largest
crowd of the season, and all those who
went to see the Kohlberg, Strauss &
Frohmans of San Francisco struggle once
more with the sturdy Vallejos are con
gratulating themselves on having seen as
good a game of ball as was ever played
on a diamond. It took twelve innings to
decide who were the victors, and then
Bob Les sent out a liner that brought in
two men and made the score 5 to 4 in ia

POLITICS ABOVE LAW IN
SANTA CLARA COUNTY
How the Matthews Murder Case Is
Being Put Off Until After
Election.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 24.â Politics is above
the majesty of law in Santa Clara Coun
ty, and just now certain politicians are
interfering with the Superior Court. Joh.n
Matthews, the drunken constable of Mil
pitas, who shot and killed Henry Hopken
on June 28 last, has a number of influen
tial friends, and they are doing everything
possible to postpone his trial until tne
crime is forgotten. The case has been set
for trial four times before Judge Lorigan,
and each time a continuance has been
granted. This morning the case was
called again for trial, and Judge Lorigan
granted a continuance until Isovember 10,
two days after election. This delay was
allowed on the presentation of a doctor s
certificate that Attorney Burchard, coun
sel for Matthews, was ill.
These frequent continuances are caus
ing much comment from the people. It is
nearly four months since Matthews comm
itteditted his crime and he has not been
brought to trial yet. Attorney Cotnran,
who is aiding in the prosecution, stated
this morning that men had been
to see him to get his consent to another
postponement. They had come at the re
quest of George Y. Bollinger, Democratic
nominee for Sheriff. Certain men had
agreed to support Bollinger for Sheriff if
he would secure a postponement of the
trial. The same proposition had also been
made to District Attorney Herrington,
and these two candidates have evidently
been using their influence, because it is
impossible to bring Matthews to trial. A
large block of votes at Milpitas is the re
ward to be given them.
Matthews' crime was a horrible one.
On the night of the killing he was drunk.
His buggy was tied in front of a saloon
on the Milpitas road. A tramp stole his
coat and whip from the rig and he start
ed in pursuit of the thief. A mile down
the road he overtook Hopken. a 19-year
old boy. who was visiting in the vicinity,
and driving up alongside of him shot him
down in cold blood.
CHEEKY PROPOSAL OF
A MILWAUKEE BREWERY
Would Christen the Wisconsin With
Beer and Offers to Furnish
a Souvenir Bottle.
MILWAUKEE, Wis.. Oct. 24.â One of
the Milwaukee brewing companies has
made a bold proposition to the Wiscon
sin Battleship Commission to use beer in
stead of wine in christening the WiÃCon
sln, and seriously expects to advertise
its product by the occasion. A formal
offer was submitted to furnish the com
mission a souvenir bottle of beer, to be
made up as follows: It is to contain a
"solid silver stopper, gold and silver fila
gree net holder, suitably inscribed: satin
ribbon bow and streamers, etc.; will be
designed and submitted to you for ap
proval, and every effort made to have the
gift suitable for the auspicious event."
The proposition has aroused indignation
and there is no likelihood that the promi
nent occasion will be permitted to be
used for advertising Deer of a certain
make.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW ORLEANS, Oct. 24.â The
Picayune's Forest, Miss., special says:
Eleven dead negroes, one dead white
man, and one negro and three white
men seriously wounded, is the result at
this writing of the bloody war being
waged between tne white and black
races in the Harpersvllle neighborhood
of this (Scott) county. Several of the
rioters have been captured and lodged
in Jail at Forest to-day, but the others
escaped into the swamps. Large crowds
of white men are in close pursuit, how
ever, and more names are hourly ex
pected to be added to the death list.
The following Is a partial list of the
killed:
Negroes.
FISH BUREE.
J. E. GATEWOOD.
HENRY ANDERSON.
JOHN GATEWOOD.
HUGH ANDERSON. .
SIM HARALSON.
BEN HARALSON.
Whites.
W. H. SIBLEY.
The wounded: Blackâ Ned Pace.
Whiteâ James Hamilton, M. Johnson,
James Armstrong.
It is impossible to obtain a full list
of the killed for the reason that some of
the negroes were shot down in the
woods and were hurriedly buried by the
whites where they fell. A member of
the posse said that he helped bury the
negroes in trenches, but neither himseli
nor any one in his crowd knew their
names, and they did nut care enough
about them to inquire.
Governor McLaunn went to Harpers
vine last night and appealed to the
whites not to molest the prisoners in
the custody of the Sheriff. The Gover
nor's talk had a good effect on the ma
jority of those in the crowd, but some
of the hot-headed members did not
relish the Governor's interference, but
he finally persuaded the crowd to per
mit the Sheriff to take the prisoners to
Jail Sheriff Stevenson had placed addi
tional guards at the Forest jail to pre- ]
vent the lynching of the rioters now in
custody. Two negroes who are under
arrest have made full confession.
Thf funeral of the murdered officer, I
Slbley, occurred at Harpersville to-day, j
and was attended by hundreds of peo
ple It is reported here that two of the |
murdered man's brothers are on their j
way from his home in lazoo t-ountj
at the lieao* of a larg^ crowd, bound for
the scene of the race war.
Sheriff Stevenson considered the sit
uation so serious to-night that he de
cided to take the prisoners to Meridian
for safe keeping. A large posse was
organized and the negroes will be
placed on the 9 o'clock train.
CONFLICT RAGES
IN NORTH CAROLINA
WILMINGTON, N. C, Oct. 24.âAd
vices from Aahpole this morning say
the town is closely guarded by whites
and that all Is quiet. The reference is,
of course, to the tragedy of yesterday
morning, the following account of
which appears in the Wilmington
gtar: At 3 o'clock yesterday morning a
gquad from the negroes who were dis
persed at Ashpole, Robson County,
crept up to tov.-n and shot three whites
stationed there as guards. They were
Albert Floyd, Robert Ir.man and Wil
liam Bullard. Dullard is seriously
wounded and the others are slightly
hurt. A hundred whites with blood
hounds are now in pursuit, and it is
said four of the negroes have been
caught. The whites are telegraphing
the principal towns in the State for
Winchester rifles to be sent there im-
mediately.
The four negroes who shot the three
white guards were captured near Ash
pole. They were brought to bay by the
whites and are now confined In box
cars at Ashpole and heavily guarded.
It is feared that the negroes will at
tempt to assassinate the guards, which
will so exasperate the whites as to
cause more serious trouble. The guard
was composed of eight or ten men who
were standing around the fire in the
open air, thus becoming easy targets
for the negroes, who fired under cover
of darkness and then fled.
The Ashpole incident has increased
the excitement at Wilmington, which
is near the riot line.
NEW YORK, Oct. 24.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
President McKinley and his advisers
are very uneasy over the situation in
North Carolina and the danger of a
raoe war in that State. Senator Prltch
ard has written a letter to a Republican
official giving a gloomy picture of the
gituatlon and saying that the Governor
may have to call on the President for
troops to quell prospective riots. The
North Carolina situation and Senator
Pritchard's letter were discussed by the
President and Cabinet to-day. In ad
vance of a request for troops from
Governor Russell no decision will be
reached as to the action to be taken
by the administration. President Mc-
Klnley and Senator Hanna are charged
by many Southern politicians with be
ing in no little degree responsible for
the situation in North Carolina and
other Southern States. It is pointed out
that the President's appointment of
negroes to office throughout the South
has been very distasteful to the whites.
According to some of the Southern poli
ticians the President had it in his
power to do more to solve the race
problem in the South than any man
fince the war. He has deliberately
thrown this chance away, they say, and
it may be another generation before
another such opportunity is presented.
DECISION AGAINST THE
PULLMAN COMPANY
Uupreme Court of Illinois Beatricts
Its Operations to Charter
Limitations.
CHICAGO, Oct. 24.â The Supreme Court
j>f Illinois decided to-day that the action
Instituted by ex-Attorney General Mau
rice T. Moloney during his term of office
to compel Pullman's Palace Car Company
to restrict its operations to charter limi
tations should stand, and remanded the
! case to the Circuit Court of Cook County,
| where it will now be fried.
Ex-Attorney General Moloney had con
tended that the Pullman company was
incorporated simply for the purpose of
making, selling andÂ»leasing railroad and
street cars. His object was to compel
â  the company to retire from the real es
tate, gas, water, heating, brtckmaking
and other enterpriser conducted by It at
the town of Pullman and In Chicago.
The ease was fought by counsel for the
company and was thrown out by the Cir
cuit Court. Counsel for the State de
murred and appeal was taken to the Su
preme Court, which was decided In favor
of the former Attorney General.
CRAMPS DELIVER THE

PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 24.â Japan's

sented by Commander N. Kashievabra,

sign as a special courtesy to Secretary-
Long and officers of our navy. She
cannot, however, fire a salute to Sec
retary Long, as her guns are at the
works of Sir William Armstrong at
NewcastJe-on-Tyne, England, whither
the prow of the cruiser will be turned
when she shortly departs from this
country-

HALF A MILLION
GOES UP IN SMOKE
Four Blocks Along the Brooklyn Wa
ter Front Destroyed by
Fire.
NEW YORK, Oct. 24.â Fire broke out
! shortly after 3 o'clock this afternoon at
| Pier 3d, East River, Brooklyn, and did
[ damage to the amount of $500,000. A north
wind fanned the flames fiercely and in a
few minutes the water front for four
blocks, extending from Van Dyke to Wal
cott streets, was ablaze.
Among the heaviest losses is that of
; George L. Hammond, owner of the naval
: stones, which is estimated at $100,000.
I The British ship Andorenha, owned by P.
! W. Roberts of Liverpool, England, and
valued at $300,000. lying at Pier 34, caught
fire. She was consigned to Ralli Bros.,
! commission merchants. The blazing yes
! sel was towed to the Gowanus Flats and
will probably be a- total loss. The Brook
lyn Wharf and Warehouse Company, ac
cording to the best estimates, will lose
$150,080.

ANARCHIST ARRESTS IN

HAIFA, Palestine. Oct. 24.â The police
made an important arrest of a well-known
anarchist here yesterday. Extraordinary
precautions are being taken to Insure the
safety of Emperor William and Empress
Augusta Victoria. During the time that
they are here veiled women will not be
allowed in the streets, as the police fear
that anarchists might assume these dis
guises.
INDIAN SUPERSTITION
PREVENTS A BURIAL
Body of a Squaw Kept From Inter-
ment in Unhallowed
Ground.
SAN BERNARDINO, Oct. 24.â An In
dian squaw named Juana Rozon was
found dead in a hut last night. She had
been dead for some time and the body was
guarded by two other squaws. It was not
buried because the Government had sold
the last of their burying grounds to
private citizens and superstition forbade
the Indians burying the remains in un
hallowed ground. Formerly there were
several ancient Indian burial grounds
near here. Recently the last was turned
over to the white men and planted to
oranges. The remains were given decent
burial in the city cemetery by the au
thorities.
THE SAN FRAKCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 25, 1898.
EXAMINERS GO
UP IN SMOKE
More Garbage Crema
tory Circulation.
LOS ANGELES BURNS A LOT
ANOTHER. CHAPTER OF THE
GREAT BUNKO GAME.
Thousands of Copies of the Yellow
Journal Feed the Fires in the
Southern California
City.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 24.â The San
Francisco Examiner, the paper which
divides its time between blackmailing
corporations and running fake money
getting schemes, evidently has papers
to burn. In fact, it has so many pa
pers to turn that the San Francisco
crematory is of too limited capacity to
take care of them all, and in order to
help out the circulation liar the people
of Los Angeles have been treated to a
sample of how this monarch of fakers
swells its totals in its sworn state
ments.
Three Immense drayloads of overripe
Examiners have been taken to the cre
matory in this city and the sur
rounding air polluted with the offensive
smoke from its reeking pages.
In order to make a, showing in Its
circulation statement thousands of Ex
aminers have been sent to this city and
stored away in the big cellar under the
branch office, and on Saturday the ac
cumulation so overcrowded the space of
25x100 feet that it became necessary
to get rid of them, and the circulation
department of the crematory was called
into requisition to dispose of the lot.
Hundreds of bundles of papers, which
had never been untied since they
reached this city, were piled up on the
sidewalk in front of the office until the
street presented the appearance of be
ing barricaded, and the citizens of Los
Angeles were treated to an object les
son in the way of a fake newspaper
faking a circulation.
In its reply to the charges that It had
sent thousands of copies to the crema-
Tory in San Francisco, the Examiner
fnltted that the bundles were so dis
ed of, but claimed that there was
hlng but "spoiled" sheets and waste
paper. This defense cannot lie in the
case of the papers burned in Los An
geles, for they have no press here to
spoil the sheets, nor do they have waste
paper other than the general wasteful
ness of using white paper for printing
such papers. The papers burned in
the Los Angeles crematory were the
papers that were regularly printed and
sent out regardless of the demand for
thfm, and the accumulation simply
shows the extent of the bunko game
which the Examiner has been playing
on the people of this city.
Just how many thousand papers were
burned and just what part they played
in the fake circulation statement of
Portion of the Barricade of Examiners Waiting to Be Taken to the Crematory.

that paper cannot be told in exact num
bers, but when it is known that there
were three large drayloads of the pa
pers and that it took six hours for the
crematory to dispose of them some idea
may be had of the bogus circulation of
Los Angeles. .
Notwithstanding the fact that every
scheme known to a decadent newspaper
for increasing its circulation has been
tried here, and that the newsboys have
given away large numbers of copies
to get rid of them, the people do not
take kindly to the blackmailing bood
ler, and the result is that the wind has
circulated the foul smoke over the city
and the people say that even this Is
preferable to the matter that is to be
found in the columns of the paper.
When the elevator began to disgorge
the accumulated bundles from the cel
lar a crowd of curious citizens was at
tracted by the unusual spectacle, and
when it was learned that the crematory
was the destination of the drays the
Jeers and hoots of the spectators told
plainly the position that the Examiner
holds in the popular mind In this city.
Many followed the drays to the crema
tory and saw the bundles deposited in
the receptacle for garbage, and then
yellow smoke began pouring out of the
tall chimney, and a new chapter was
written on fake newspaper circulation
in Southern California.
The question that is now agitating '
the minds of the people here Is how the |
Examiner disposes of the vast amount
of extra papers which It sends to all
parts of the State where there are no I
crematories. The people can now read
ily understand Just how badly fooled
Examiner advertisers are when ' they
buy space In a paper on Its sworn state
ments of circulation, when that cir
culation is largely made by the wind
at the top of the crematory chimneys.
and if the number of Examiners that
are burned in the San Francisco crema
tory is in the same proportion to the
circulation in that city as is the num
ber burned here to the circulation in
Los Angeles, then fully one-fourth of
the circulation is in smoke.
Already the fact of this bunko game
has been spread broadcast over the
city and the result is that many who
have been induced to take or buy the
Monarch of the Fakers say that they
will have nothing to do with it and re
fuse to become a party to the circula
tion of a paper that descends to such
disreputable methods. The exposure
of its blackmailing scheme against the
Southern Pacific Company has shown
the people that its business methods
and its boodling schemes are of a kind
and If the paper had any influence
whatever heretofore that influence has
been completely nullified by the object
lesson of last Saturday.
NEW SOUTHERN PACIFIC

To Strike the Main Line at Beau

Work.
SALT LAKE, Oct. 24.â For some weeks
past a railroad surveying party has been
operating in the vicinity of Richfield,
Utah. â¢ Much speculation has been in
dulged in as to the purpose of the sur
vey or the Identity of the employers of
the party. From a special dispatch from
Richfield it has just been learned that
the head of the party is L. A. Long, an
engineer in the employ of thÂ» Southern

to local railroad officials, the object of
the survey is easy to see. The Southern

Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON, Oct. 24.â The Boston Fruit
Company's steamer Beverly arrived at
her dock here at 7 o'clock this morn
ing:, twenty-four hours late, having on
! board Naval Constructor Richmond P.
j Hobson.
Previous to Hobson's departure for
Washington he was questioned by a re
porter as to the prospect of raising the
sunken Spanish war vessels off Santi
ago. He said he was now engaged in
the preliminary work on the Cristobal
Colon, and that It would take at least
three weeks more before anything
would be ready.
The Government had appropriated
$500,000 for the raising of the vessel, but
It will be money well spent, he said, If
the venture proves a success, as the
ship is worth $4,000,000.
The purpose of his visit to this coun
try, Hobson said, was to see the Secre
tary of the Navy regasding further
work on the warships. He thought the
i Vizcaya could be saved, but would not
j state positively. She had settled in
j the sand, which has formed a thick bed
I around her, so that she is resting in an
I easy position, but a drydock would
have to be built around her before she
could be raised. An appropriation of
i $1,000,000 would cover the work of rais
ing the Vizcaya and would enable the
Government to bring her north and put
: her into good condition. She cost $3,
j 000,000.
The Almirante Oquendo, Lieutenant
Hobson says, is a hopeless wreck. The
i Reina Mercedes, which was sunk in
I Santiago harbor, Is a good vessel and
\ can be raised with but little cost.
"When the work on the Infanta Ma
ria Teresa commenced," continued
Hobson, "I had fifty American laborers
employed, but owing to the foul at
mosphere, foul gases and foul water
very few escaped sickness, and I was
obliged to fall back on Cuban laborers.
These men seem to stand the work very
well, and under proper supervision can
accomplish good results.
"There is a growing sentiment, I find, j
among naval officers that every one of
the sunken Spanish ships should be
raised, and If found to be unseaworthy
be kept as relics.
"The Spanish vessels which have
been and those that no doubt will bo
saved and put in commission should re
tain their names as a memento of the
prowess of America."

GENERAL MERRITT
QUIETLY MARRIED

DUE TO THE BRIDE'S ILLNESS
MISS WILLIAMS COMPELLED TO
FOREGO CHURCH WEDDING.
The Couple to Go to Manila at the
Conclusion of the Peace Con
ference Now Being Held
at Paris.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Oct. 24.â General Merrltt
and Miss Williams were married at 6
o'clock this evening: in the bride's
apartments at the Savoy Hotel.
It had been planned to have the cere
mony take place in St. Andrew's
Church, Westminster, but an illness
which Miss Williams contracted dur
ing the voyage necessitated the sim
plest possible ceremony, and the avoid
ance of exertion and excitement. Con
sequently only a few relatives and inti
mate friends were present. They were
Mrs. Norman Williams, the bride's
mother; Norman Williams Jr., her
brother; Lord and Lady Arthur Butler,
Henry White, the United States Charge
d' Affaires and Marshal Dodge. A less
ostentatious wedding could not be im
agined. The general strolled from the
Metropole to the savoy unattended,
wearing a beaver hat, a frock coat and
a white tie. The party gathered in the
drawing-room, which had been beauti
fied by a few flowers. ahe Rev. John
Heathcote, rector of St. Andrew's, offi
ciated. The bride entered on the arm
of her brother, who gave her away.
She was attired in white satin and
wore the usual veil and orange blos
soms. Though looking ill, the bride
stood throughout the ceremony and
pronounced the responses in a strong
voice.
After the ceremony Mr. White pro
posed the health of the bride, which
was drunk with enthusiasm, and the
members of General Merritt's staff en
tered and congratulated the newly
married couple. The guests after
ward departed, and Mr. and Mrs. Mer
ritt dined alone. The bride's illness,
which for a time it was feared would
develop Into typhoid fever, was the
cause ctf the abandonment of the cere
mony which was to have taken place
in St. Andrew's Church. In fact, yes
terday it was thought the wedding
would have to be postponed indefinite
ly, but Miss Williams was so Im
proved this morning that it was de
cided at noon not to delay the wedding,
but abandon the proposed ceremony in
the church.
Then the red tape of English law
threatened to be another obstacle, but,
thanks to the friendly offices of Mr.
White, it was overcome. When Gen
eral Merritt's aid-de-camp applied for
a certificate to the registrar he was in
formed that four days' notice was
necessary. Mr. White was then ap
plied to. He had just returned from
visiting- Mr. Balfour, the first Lord of
the Treasury, in Scotland, and he spent
the afternoon in impressing on the of
ficials the importance of waiving for
malities. After much drlviner about
| and many interviews, Mr. White suo
ceeded in gaining the desired docu
ment, though the expectant couple
waited an hour after the time fixed foÂ»>
the ceremony.
The illness of the bride has not
proved as serious as expected, and Gen
eral and Mrs. Merritt will be able to
carry out their plan of going to Paris
at the end of the week. They will pro
ceed to the Philippine Islands after the
adjournment of the Peace Commission.
BADLY SCARED BY

Have a Narrow Escape From
Death at Santiago.
SANTIAGO DE CI T BA, Oct. 24.âGen
eral Wood, the acting military com
mander here, and Major Brooks had a
narrow escape last evening from a seri
ous disaster. They had started down the
bay on the way to Morro Castle on a
steam launch which, seemingly, had a
hundred pounds of steam registered. But
she lost fllty pounds in the first two min
utes, and a green engineer, who was in
charge of her, discovering that there was
little or no water In the boiler, was about
to fill it while it was almost redhot. Ma
jor Brooks saw the danger, stopped the
launch and had the fire drawn, and the
launch was towed back to her starting
place. The engineer was discharged.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 24.â The bish
ops and deputies gave most of their
time to-day to reconciling differences
between them on the revised constitu
tion In anticipation of final adjourn
ment to-morrow. It disclosed much
tenacity on the part of the deputies to
direct the affairs of their own house,
without the control of the bishops. The
question came on a conference report
on article I, which recommended that
the views of the disposal, on the man
ner of choosing members of the House
of Deputies, and giving missionary
deputies the right to vote, be ac
cepted.
The report was warmly opposed. Mr.
Francis Linde Stetson of New York
argued that there was a proposition to
surrender to the bishops the constitu
tional direction of the Ho ise of Depu
ties. The Rev. Dr. McKim of Wash
ington also argued that the deputies
should control the organization of their
own house.
Final agreement was reached to-day
in both houses of the council on the
articles for the consecration of bishops
for foreign lands.
Roland E. Gruber of Ohio was desig
nated to-day by the House of Bishop 3
as editor of the committee charged
with preparing for church use the
translation of the prayer book into Ger
man. Other members of the commit
tee are Dr. C. C. Tiffany, New York;
Johann S. E. Rockstich, Re;'. J. P.
Peters, New York, and Benjamin W.
Wells of the University of the South.
Another conference report was sub
mitted to the deputies on article 1 of
the constitution and it was adopted.
The committee reported that the dif
ferences between the deputies and
bishops had been adjusted in accord
ance with the sentiments of the depu
ties indicated in the debate during the
morning.
An amendment was adopted to the
canons giving a presbyter an equal
right with the bishop of a diocese to
appeal to the presiding bishop for a
council of conciliation to settle differ
ences, instead of the present canon,
which gives the bishops preference in
the matter of time.
The House of Bishops spent most of
the time of the afternoon in considering
the draft of the pastoral letter read in
the churches after the conclusion of the
work of the triennial council.
Rev. George Colinhill of Delaware
was elected bishop for the missionary
district of Kioto, Japan.
The announcement was made in the
House of Bishops to-day that the first
Protestant Episcopal clergyman to en
ter Porto Rico to spread the gospel of
the American church will leave New
York next Wednesday. He is Rev. Mr.
Taft of St. George's Church, and he is
sent by Bishop Potter of New York.
His headquarters will be at Ponce,
where he will first care for the Amer
ican sick and wounded in the hospital
there and thÂ»n administer to whoever
desires his services.
'Apple Crop a Widespread Failure.
CHICAGO, Oct. 24.â The Orange Judd
Farmer will say to-morrow: The apple
crop of the United States is smaller than
it has ever been before since reliable sta
tictlcs have been collected. The total sup
ply from the 189S crop of the United States
is 27,700,000 barrels, as compared with
something over 40,000,000 last year and 70,
000,000 in the record-breaking crop of 1897.
The failure is widespread, reaching from
the Pacific Coast to Maine, and in no one
of the apple States does the output of
fruit approach an average.

Examination of Romero and Carnes

Special Dispatch to The Call.
TVATSONVILLE, Oct. 24.â The Os
born abduction case occupied the at
tention of the general public to-day
and there was much speculation dur
ing the forenoon as to the outcome of
the preliminary hearing. When the
prisoners were brought into court the
room was packed to suffocation. Ro
mero was accompanied by his sister, a
rather pretty girl. Carnes, the other
prisoner, was painfully uneasy.
Brad Sargent of Salinas, the defend
ant's attorney, sprung a surprise by ob
jecting to going to trial before Re
corder Hawkins on the ground of prej
udice. Sargent declared the court
had advanced theories to him as to the
guilt of the men. which indicated that
his mind was biased. This Recorder
Hawkins emphatically denied, but
rather than take any chances on ob
jections called Justice of the Peace
Yoacham to preside. When the court
was ready to proceed District Attorney
Lindsey demanded the services of a
stenographer, and after considerable
delay it was found there was no one in
town capable of doing the work. The
prosecution then asked for a continu
ance until Wednesday, which was
granted.
The officers are now working ener
getically. District Attorney Lindsey
and Sheriff Besse put in the greater
part of the day in strengthening their
case, and expect to go into court Wed
nesday with the evidence necessary to
remand Carnes for trial betore the Su
perior Court. Carnes came here from
Gilroy two months ago. He had been
working in that neighborhood for about
a year, and the statement comes from
that town that he was suspected of be
ing guilty of crimes similar to the Wat
sonville case, and was given two hours
to get out of the place.
Romero's record In Salinas, his home,
Is good, and the probabilities are that
he will be released on the preliminary
examination.
Mrs. Jane Baker, the woman with
whom Carnes lodged here and who had
him as a boarder in Gilroy, was put
through a rigid examination this after
noon by District Attorney Lindsey and
Sheriff Besse. The woman has long
been an associate of half-castes, and
succeeded in contradicting herself
many times.
Much time was devoted by the Dis
trict Attorney to-day in endeavoring to
trace the pasteboard coffee can, which
was used by the abductors as a dark
lantern. It is a large three-pound
package, put up by a San Francisco
house. It has a crude swinging door
cut in the side and a candle was used
for the light. Owing to the fact that
such cans are sold in most grocery
stores, the effort to trace it has thus
far been fruitless.
Edna Osborn, the child who nar
rowly escaped abduction, was in court
to-day. She is exceedingly large for a
girl of her age, 12 years, weighing near
ly 130 pounds. She is a quiet, unas
suming miss, and evidently does not
realize the narrow escape she had.
Owing to the unusual darkness that
prevailed on the night of the abduc
tion, she could not see the face of the
man who carried her out of the house,
and was therefore unable to identify
the prisoners.
After going over the ground thor
oughly to-day District Attorney Llnd
sey stated that the evidence up to this
evening is very strong against Carnes.
The officials paid considerable atten
tion to a new theory as to the motive of
the crime, which was advanced to-day.
It is a novel one and involves not only
abduction, but robbery. The proposi
tion is that the miscreants got into the
wrong room, intending to abduct Miss
Edna's elder sister. She is the money
order clerk and cashier in the postoffice
under her father. She is presumed to
know the combination of the safe in
which there is usually a considerable
amount of money each night, and it is
thought that the men Intended to con
vey her to the postoffioe, force her to
unlock the safe and deliver up the con
tents. The darkness of the night and
the fact that the streets are deserted
at that hour would have enabled such
bold desperadoes to perfect their job.
GILROY, Oct. 24.â W. C. Bennett
says that Fred Carnes is not the man
â who was ordered to leave Gilroy. It
was a case of mistaken identity. From
the description Bennett heard of Carnes
he thought it tallied with the man who
was ordered to leave, and so informed
the Constable at Watsonville. He has
since discovered that the guilty man
was a Spaniard whose first name was
Fred, last name unknown. Carnes re
sided two years in Gilroy, and his em
ployers and associates speak highly' of
him.
VENTURA, Oct. 24.â 1f the Fred
Carnes now under arrest in Watson
ville is the same Fred Carnes once a
resident of this city, he is well known
throughout the county and his reputa
tion and record cannot be considered of
the best. Some six or seven years ago
he was Deputy County Auditor and
Recorder. He served in this capacity
for three years. His father and nu
merous brothers and sisters are still
residents of this county and are highly
resppcted. His father, Henry Carnes,
is quite a prominent and honored citi
zen. He has held several public of- 1
flees, among which was Postmaster of
Banta Barbara for two terms. When
Fred Carnes departed from this city
about six years ago he left a dark cloud
behind him.

SAN JUAN TO BE AN
IMPORTANT NAVAL POST
WASHINGTON. Oct. 24.â Secretary
Long has taken the initial steps to
make San Juan de Porto Rico the first
naval station of the United States in
the West Indian waters. Congress will
be asked to appropriate money enough
to make It one of tbe best equipped na
val stations the United State 3 has.
Speaking of this Secretary Long says:
"A station at San Juan will be of the
utmost importance to the Government
and to the navy. San Juan is an excel
lent place for a good many of our ships
in the winter time. It is an invaluable
possession from every point of view."
A naval official said: "Congress will
be asked to appropriate a large sum of
money for the Improvement of San
Juan harbor and the coast defenses. It
is probable that the historic forts will
be retained ac far as possible. It is
not unlikely that a navy yard will be
established/] '

SAN JOSE, Oct. 24.â The conviction
of "Boss" Rea for slander has had a
good effect. Even in the short time :
elapsed since Saturday evening it has ,
proved a stimulus to the people, and :
many formerly lukewarm anti-gang
men are now pronounced in their ideas. '
Many people though Rea invincible, but
now that a jury has been found to con
vict him they express themselves as
willing to oppose him in politics. Now
that his tongue has been bridled and ,
the people need not fear his slanderous !
remarks this class of voters will flock
to the aid of the Good Government
League.
The verdict has had a demoralizing
effect upon the gang. At the Califor
nia Club, the headquarters of the gang
sters, all was excitement yesterday and
last night. The boldness of the jury
in convicting Rea has stampeded hun
dreds of voters, and Rea and the Mac
kenzies know this. The gang see that
their disreputable tactics will no longer !
be tolerated, and that campaigns of
abuse. Blander and terrorism must
cease. Last night's meeting at the
California Club was a sort of a con
solation meeting, and the boss' lieuten
ants wore .Jong and sober faces. The \
Mackenzies and others who do Rea's |
bidding are being Eeized with "cold j
feet" and they shrink from doing acts j
that they were formerly ready to per
form. It will be hard to get ballot
box stuffers to perform the dirty work
that was done at the late Republican j
primary, for the gang now realizes that I
the majesty of the law is greater than !
Rea.
"Johnnie" Mackenzie Is working
harder than ever to supplant Rea. In |
Kea's conviction he sees a chance to j
slip in as leader of the gang, and is
holding out nattering promises, to his
followers for their support. Macken
zie is satisfied that the old way of do
ing San Jose politics was crushed out
with the reading of the verdict in the
Rea case Saturday evening, ana he
proposes to conduct things along dif
ferent lines. He would exclude all the
classes of dirty work he did for Rea
and give the city a cleaner regime for
a time. In doing this he could lay all
disreputable methods employed in past
elections to Rea. Mackenzie stands a
good chance of succeeding Rea, but the
people want none of him and are de
termined to stamp out the entire Rea
gang.
The Republican Good Government
League is making a determined war
fare against the gang and gang rule.
Never before were the reform forces so
well organized. Every one of the sevÂ»
enty-two precincts of the county has
been organized and thoroughly can
vassed by members of the league.
Meetings have been held and literature
disseminated and the voters educated
up to facts that the people's money is
being ruthlessly expended by extrava
gant officials. Farmers and orchard
ists have for a long time complained of
the way county affairs are conducted,
and they are more determined this year
than ever to vote the gangsters out of
office.
The Goad Government League held a
meeting at Mountain View this even
ing. Speeches Were made by candi
dates and others. County affairs were
gone into and the extravagance of offi
cials explained. The people were urged
to support Gage and the entire State
ticket. Meetings have been arranged
as follows for the balance of the week:
Gilroy, Tuesday evening; Berryessa,
Wednesday; Alviso, Thursday: Gard
ner, Friday, and Palo Alto, Saturday.
It has just leaked out that the gang
has been arranging to bring Companies
B and M, Eighth Regiment, here to vote
on election day. By this means they
are figuring on adding a couple of hun
dred votes to their ticket. The citizens
of San Jose want to see the soldier boys
come home and vote, but they object
to the attempt being made to vote them
in a band for the Rea gang. Company
B is at Fort Point and M at Alcatraz.
Captain Partridge of the former is re
lated to "Boss" Rea by marriage and
was in the District Attorney's offlcs
before the company was called Into ser
vice. It is through him and other
members of the organization that thÂ«
gang expect help. Company M will
undoubtedly rebel at any such request
as voting the gang ticket. This latter
company was organized through the in
strumentality of Mitchell Phillips,
chairman of the Good Government
League campaign committee, and they
will not bow to the dictates of Rea.

RED BLUFF, Oct. 24.â Henry T.
Gage, Republican nominee for Gov
ernor, and General W. H. L. Barnes,
the matchless orator, passed a
quiet and restful Sunday at Redding.
The clouds which showered the Upper
Sacramento Valley with rains laid a
mantle of snow on the noble mountains
of Shasta, and in the clear atmosphere
of Sunday the great white dome of the
mountains was beautiful to behold.
Early this morning Mr. Gage and
General Barnes left Redding and ar
rived at Red Bluff shortly after 9 o'clock.
Everywhere assurances were received
of Republican gains in Shasta and Te
hama counties. At the Red Bluff rail
way depot the standard-bearer and his
eloquent associate were greeted by a
throng of Republicans and escorted to
the Tremont Hotel by Major G. G.
Kimball, General N. P. Chipman,
Judge Ellison. D. S. Cone and G. H.
Chase, secretary of the Republican
County Central Committee. No formal
reception was arranged, hence the
standard-bearer had an opportunity to
meet in every-day style many of the
farmers, stockmen and merchants of
this region. The people have no hesi
tation in coming forward to meet the
next Governor, for they observe at a
glance that Mr. Gage is one of the
plain people.
It is refreshing to the masses to see
in a candidate a man who has not de
voted his life to office hunting and of
fice holding. The voters of political
persuasion are weary of the office
holding aristocracy, and resent the no
tion that a privileged class should be
created to fatten on the public treas
ury. Mr. Gage is therefore welcomed
as a candidate of the people and for the
people, and all the Republicans of
Northern California support him with
enthusiastic devotion, and many old
line Democrats and patriotic Populists
step forward and announce their pur
pose to vote for him. The enthusiasm
and popular uprisings, which have
made the towns of Northern California
memorable, convince Mr. Gage and
General Barnes that the Republicans'
cause will triumph on November 8, and
that the victory will be one of the
greatest, if not the greatest, ever
achieved in California. This is not the
Judgment of twenty men or a hundred
men, here and there, but is the ex
pressed judgment of thousands. The
people of Northern California are fully
aroused to the dangers of single tax.
Late in the afternoon people began to
arrive from the ranches and ranges
and from the various towns of Tehama
County. There was no organized plan
to excite enthusiasm. The demonstra
tion was spontaneous. At 7:30 big bon
fires were lighted and the Red Bluff
band discoursed inspiring music. The
Manhattan Glee Club lined up on the
baJcony of the Tremont Hotel and sung
campaign songs as the procession was
forming. The pavilion was beautifully
decorated, under the direction of Mr.
Chase, secretary of the County Com
mute?, and the speakers' stand so
placed in the center that the speakers
could be heard without special effort.
The arrival of Henry T. Gage and
K;ral Barnes was the signal for a
t demonstration.' The meeting was
d to order by E. W. Runyon, chair
rimn of the Republican County Com
mittee, who introduced aB the presid
ing officer the veteran soldier and able
Republican, General N. P. Chipman.
The following vice presidents were an-
W. E. Hazen, G. M. Lowrey, Charles
HeÃse, Dr. G. W. Westlake, A. T. Ellis,
G. G. Kimball, Andrew Simpson, C. E.
Christian, L. Doring, George Hoage, B.
A. Bell, H. S. Gans, Dr. W. H. Labarre,
Tester Champlin, R. H. Blossom, D.
In presenting Henry T. Gage Gen
eral Chipman naid: "I have come 200
miles to ask you, my neighbors and
friends, to again stand by the grand
old party that has so nobly stood by
this county." (Applause.) He re
marked that Californlans were called
upon to give their approval or disap
proval of the administration of William
McKinley. The mention of the Presi
dent's name invoked a round of hearty
applause. A few words were said to
the sheep growers of Tehama County
and they were asked to Judge whether
the Dingley tariff bill was just and
wise.' Reference was made to terri
torial expansion, a subject which the
i.irman indicated would be dwelt
m by General Barnes.
lenry T. Gage was introduced as the
:t Governor and another outburst of
husiasm hailed the introduction. Mr.
je at once proceeded to a discussion
the leading issue of the campaign,
single tax. In a forcible and logical
nner he exposed the dangers to the
home that lurked behind this phase of
socialism. The farmers present listened
with close attention to every word ut
tered on this engrossing question. When
Mr. Gage finished his masterly review
of the single tax scheme his hearers
were convinced that Maguire could not
dodge his record as a single-taxer.
Again the record was presented to show
the attitude of Mr. Maguire on this
Reference was made to Maguire's at
tempt in introduce the funding bill
amendment ac an issue of th>i cam
paign. To make the fact clear to the
voters of Tehama County that Mr. Ma
guire did nnt object to the amendment.
fn his objection would have defeat
he measure, Mr. Gage submitted
overwhelming proof contained in
pages of the Congressional Record.
Incidentally Mr. Gage asked: "Did you
gee what a wail the Examiner is setting
up for coin? The fusionists are wailing
that they will be ruined if they do not
raise $5000. -They are ruined now."
(Great applause).
The standard bearer took occasion to
thank the people of Tehama County
for the support the county gave him
in the State Convention. The assault
on the integrity of the delegates to the
convention was repelled. In closing,
Mr. Gage promised, if elected Governor,
to give the people a clean, fearless, pru
dent and business-like administration.
The pledge elicited from the vast as
semblage applause long continued.
The audience was next entertained
by a campaign song from the Manhat
tan quartet of Redding.
On being recalled the singers grave a
clever song descriptive of the single
tack that the teacher sat on.
General W. H. L. Barnes was pre
sented to the audience in a very flat
tering manner. General Chipman said:
"You can now understand why the peo
ple of Southern California love Henry
T. Gage. You can see that he is a sin
cere, honest and patriotic citizen. We
have a favorite son of Northern Cali
fornia who, like Mr. Gage, is an old
and devoted Republican, who has never
sought office. It is by no menas im
possible that a Republican Legislature
may elect this able and eloquent Ke
publican. W. H. L. Barnes, to the
United States Senate." (Great ap
plause).
When General Barnes arose to speaK.
he was hailed with enthusiastic cheers.
He began his speech by predicting a re
markable triumph of the Republican
party on November 8. He spoke of his
own campaign tours since 1867, and re
marked that he had never seen such
enthusiasm, such firm Republican reso
lution, such absolute confidence in the
certainty of triumph as he had wit
nessed in this campaign. "The Exam
iner," said the general, "is now passing
around the hat to save the political re
mains of Maguire from decay. The gu
bernatorial aspirations of Judge Ma
guire are now dead. The remains will
be on exhibition for a few days longer,
but the interment will take place on
November 8, and you will please omit
flowers." (Great laughter.)
The superb orator attained great
flights of eloquence in his masterly
speech at the Red Bluff Pavilion to
night. He was inspired by a vast au
dience of fine intelligence that quickly
responded to his exalted sentiments of
American patriotism. The examples of
"16 to 1" and the reverse theory of evo
lution, "The descent of the Democrats
from Thomas Jefferson to James G.
Maguire," evoked tremendous out
bursts of applause. He dwelt at length
upon the territorial expansion, tracing
the areas acquired from the Louisiana
purchase until the acquisition of
Alaska. He touched upon the new era,
new national responsibilities and the
new commercial greatness of the re
public. The flag was exalted to the
stars, and the audience gave mighty
shouts of applause. The vast assem
blage, one of the largest that ever con
verted in Tehama County, adjourned
with cheers for the Republican ticket.
To-morrow General Barnes proceeds
to San Francisco to fill engagements
elsewhere in the State.
Mr. Gage will be joined to-day by
United States Senator Perkins, and
they will speak at Oroville to-morrow
night.
LOUD AND CARPENTER
SPEAK AT CAMPBELL
The Meeting Large and Enthusiastic
and Campaign Issues Are
Ably Handled.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 24.â People of Campbell '
turned oui in force thjs evening to wel
come Congressman Loud and Judge E. B.
Carpenter of Los Angeles. The meet
ing was large and enthusiastic. E. A. !
Cooper was chairman, and after the meet
ing he tendered the speakers a collation.
Congressman Loud discussed national .
issues with great clearness. He empha
sized the fact that the funding bill waa
ended for all time, and the efforts of ;
Maguiro to bring the railjoad into tne
campaign would prove futile. The Demo
crats, he said, claimed everything, even
Schley and Dewey. The speaker toid how
he had lived at the E&bltt House in
Washington with both men for five or six
years, and had known them personally,
but had never heard them say what their
political faith was. All he knew was that
they were American naval officers and aid
their duty when occasions occurred.
Judge Carpenter said McKinley's policy
in regard to the war had been indorsed
by all parties, and he had mapped out a
future policy that would be beneficial to
the country. To hamper him by electing
Democratic Congressmen who would op- ;
pose the administration would not be j
right, and he urged people to see that only j
Republicans were sent to Congress.

ENGLISH WAYS, REVEALED BY THE
PRINCE'S ACCIDENT.
Several readers of Truth have had a I
shot at the "hard case" of Mr. A. and
Mrs. 8., propounded in Truth a fortnight
ago. The following solution is entitled to
most weight, as It comes from the cham- ,
bers of an eminent marrister in the Ter
n The case stated, it may be remem
â¢red was that Mrs. B. promised Mr. A.
Â£1600 "for Inducing an eminent personage
to come to her party. Mr. A. induced the
eminent personage to promise, but before
the party came off the eminent personage
met with an accident, which prevented his
attending. Mr. A. claimed the Â£1500; Mrs.
B demurred to paying. This is counsel's
opinion on the Question between them:
Re Mrs. 13.; ex parte Mr. A.
Referring to the "hard case" propound
ed in Truth of the current week, 1 have to
advise: That Mrs. B. must pay Mr. A.
the stipulated Â£1500, on the grounds (a)
that the absence of the eminent person
age was due to the act of God; (b) that
Mrs B received valuable consideration |
from Mr. A. in the interimâ power and
prospect of inviting the Snobocracy to
meat the eminent personage.
Counsel goes on to volunteer the further j
opinion that the eminent personage \
should pay Â£1500 to "a hospital for the !
treatment and cure of female snobocrats"
as a thank offering for the merciful dis
pensation which saved him from the im
pertinences of Mrs. A. and her friends.
But no question in regard to any third ;
party having bcÂ«n raised on the pleading,
this can only be regarded as an obiter
dictum.
It will surprise no one to hear that I
have also obtained counsel's opinion to an
effect precisely opposite to the above. In
this case counsel is of opinion that, as the
consideration for the promise has wholly
failed, no action will lie, but as the bar
rister in this case is quite Junior (he was
only called on 18154) he has probably over
looked the well-known rule of law that in ,
doubtful cases you should always advise '
litigation, and his opinion may safely be
disregarded.â London Truth,

trict.
Epeclal Dispatch to The Call.
MADERA. Oct. 24.â J. C. Needham, |
the Republican candidate for Congress i
from the Seventh District, and Major
C. W. Kyle arrived here at nobn to- 1
day from the south, and were warmly
received by the Republican County
Central Committee. At 7:30 this even
ing a band concert was given, after
which a rousing meeting was held in
Athletic Hall.
Mr. Needham was Introduced to the
enthusiastic audience by E. E. Vin
cent, chairman of the Republican Coun
ty Central Committee, and was re
ceived with vigorous cheers. The bear
ing, the words and the appearance of
the next Congressman from this dis
trict all favorably impressed the assem
blage. In a very plain and forcible
manner Air. Needham clearly set forth
the principal issues of the present cam- j
paign, and the effect of his logical and j
unadorned presentation of the hard i
I facts was frequently demonstrated by ;
, bursts of applause from a most atten
tive audience.
He stated that it was not his purpose
to abuse his opponent or any one else.
He did not believe in it, and there were \
issues before the people of this State to ;
be discussed of far more importance ;
; than invectives and vituperation. Mr. !
! Needham then proceeded to analyze
I the triple alliance which had been
formed for the purpose alone of trying
to defeat the Republican party. He
fully explained the incongruity of the
component parts of the confusion or
ganization.
Mr. Needham then touched unon the
I Issues of tariff reform and silver as ad
' vocated by the Democratic party in the
I last two campaigns which brought
forth deafening cheers from the audi
ence. He favored the immediate con
struction and ownership by the United
States of the Nicaragua canal. He
spoke very highly of Mr. Maguire as a
gentleman, but warned voters against
his dangerous single tax theory, which
he would naturally try to bring about
if he were elected Governor. A plank
in the Democratic platform already
paved the way for It.
Chairman Vincent then Introduced
Major C. W. Kyle, whose appearance
i on the platform was greeted by loud
cheers from the audience, as this was
â  the Major's second appearance in this
campaign in Madera, and those who
had heard him before realized the treat
I in store for them.
THE OLD COUNTRY BEHIND TUB \
NEW.
The railway companies having made
up their minds to introduce the Ameri
can system of collecting and forward
ing passengers' baggage, are, meta
phorically, falling over one another in
their eagerness to have the fact known.
The London and Southwestern, the j
London and Northwestern and the j
Great Northern send us, almost slmul- i
taneously, announcements of their 'â¢
adoption of the system. The prices also
clearly indicate that a common under
standing has been arrived at. All j
charge 6d a package "within the com
pany's 1 collecting boundary," which |
seems to be within two miles and a |
half of the terminus, and all alike have |
arranged with Messrs. Carter, Pater
son & Co. to collect outside this area
at the rate of Is per package, within a
radius of seven miles, and Is 4d when
the distance exceeds this. The higher
rates are, perhaps, a little excessive for
light baggage, but seemed reasonable
enough for heavy trunks.
The introduction of this system Is
certainly a curious commentary on the
leisurely manner in which we adopt
American ideas. The practice has been
in vogue in the United States for over
thirty years, which seems to be about
the usual time that it takes an Ameri
can invention to be acclimatized here.
Tramcars, far example, were started in
New York about 1845, and introduced
here in 1860, but were speedily aban
doned, and it was not until long after
1870 that the system made much head- I
way. The messenger boy service,
again, reached us just a quarter of a
century after its enlistment in New
York As to electric lighting, Union
Square and other centers of New York
have had it for over twenty-five years,
while Palace Yard has not got it yet,
and it has been much the same with the
telephones â London Chronicle.

DICKENS AS HE WAS.
When Charles Dickens, says Youth's I
Companion, was to mÂ«.ke his first ap- j
pearance In Boston before an Ameri- !
can audience as a reader, an immense i
crowd awaited him. The enthusiasm
of the people for the most popular nov
elist then living had risen to fever
heat. One of the most ardent of his
admirers afterward told this little inci
dent of the evening.
"With a few gentlemen who wished |
to welcome and show him attention, I i
was in the little room at the back of
the platform when Dickens entered it.
He was a rather stout man with a
somewhat red face, and I saw to my
surprise that he was dressed in an ex- i
aggerated servility to the extreme j
fashion.
"More than this, he wore a bouton
niere in each buttonhole, and two
watches, the chains of which were
strung aggressively across the chest.
There was a gaudi' bad taste in his
appearance which his friends regretted, i
knowing how distasteful it would be
to most of his admirers who appreci- j
ated his genius and enjoyed his writ
"No one, of course, could broach the
subject to him, and he armeared that
night and every other night of his en
gagement in the same attire. The un- i
iversal comment was, 'Why, this is a
petit-naitre. How can a man with
such tastes be the creator of Tiny Tim
and Sam Weller?' "^
THE LONG-LIVED PANAMA HAT.
"The life of a Panama nat, mat is, it
It is a good one to start with," explained a
hat dealer, "compares somewhat with the
life of the owner of it. One can run
through either in a hurry or hang on for
a long time if it is desired. If carefully
kept a Panama hat should last all the
way 'from ten to forty years. I know a
gentleman who resides In East Washing
ton who has owned and steadily worn
during the summer months a Panama hat
for nearly forty years. It has been
bleached every couple of years since and
retrimmed and relined, and it is to-day to
all intents and purposes as good as when
I first saw it thirty years ago. I know of
another Panama hat now worn by a phy
sician in this city, which has had almost
as long a life. Long before he got it his
father wore it. I know of dozens of them

SPEAK TO THE
MEN WHO WORK
Pledges to Guard La
bor's Interests.
REPUBLICANS FIND FAVOR
SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO IN
DORSES PARTY PLATFORM.
All of the Municipal Candidates Ad
dress the Biggest and Most
Enthusiastic Gathering
of the Campaign.
It was a typical South San Francisco
audience that last evening 1 greeted al
most the full list of Republican munici
pal candidates at Masonic Hall, corner of
Fourteenth and Railroad avenues.
It was a meeting of the men who work;
who build cozy homes, rear their fami
lies and provide for their pleasures out of
each day's wage, and who, as a conse
quence, have an interest in such things
as taxes and the things that taxes are
paid out for.
They didn't come in from the butcher
shops and the car shops and the other
places that pay men livingsalaries in that
section with any fixed idea of cheering
and waxing politically enthusiastic, but
they did come to demand and receive of
the men who seek their suffrages an ac
count of their intentions and pledges of j
their fealty.
Though they did not come to cheer, they
Btayed to do so. No more enthusiastic
meeting has ever been seen since this j
year's campaign opened.
That the platform which was fnrmu- ;
latÂ«Â»d by the men who look to labor's best
interests, and the men who are standing
t, met with the full approbation of
the men who had gathered as their cen- !
eors, was demonstrated by the ringing i
cheers and hearty shouts of satisfaction J
that followed each succeeding speaker to |
his seat.
The speeches were not of length. They
were simply plain statements of the prin
ciples of platform and candidates.
Charles L. Patton was first to apeak, j
He said that the voters had just as much !
ri?ht to ask him how he stood on mat
tera that interest thorn as he had to ask;
them for their votes. He said that he j
had definite ideas on the confirmation of \
the new charter. The people had elected j
to live under it and no man nor set of j
men had the right to prevent them. If j
elected he would see to it that the right j
should not be denied them.
IlÂ»> said he believed that municipal ex- j
pense could be met by the dollar limit â 
of taxation, and he would use his best
efforts to that end.
Mr. Patton declared that public utili
ties should be public property and under ]
the new charter this will be a possi- j
billty.
"'ln our platform," said Mr. Patton. "we
have a plank that provides that every
contract for labor shall provide for eight j
hours work and not less than $2 pay for j
the laboring Iran, and if elected I shall
never sign a contract that has not that |
provision.
"Another thing I will promise is that I !
shall court the money in the public treas
uryâl won't "heft" it. One man would
not be on his way to San Quentin now if
that du'.y had been conscientiously per
formed.
"In closing I want to say that if I go
into public life upon your vote I am re
sponsible alone to you; not to any boss,
any corporation or any Influence."
The applause ha a not subsided by the
time Mr. Patton was well out of the
building on his way to another meeting.
Mr. Pillsner took his place on the ros- I
trum. and in a well-delivered speech j
pointed out that it was the voter's duty i
as a good citizen not to carry sentiment
with him to the polls, but to elect solid, j
honest and capable men. He also pointed I
out that through all political history the !
Republican party had stood alone for
progress and expansion, and stood so j
stilL
He dealt with the candidates individu
ally, and with Julius Kahn and Martin !
Fragley particularly. The hard work of j
the campaign has been too much for both ;
of those hard-working nominees, so much
so for Mr. Kahn that he was obliged to
take to his bed late yesterday afternoon.
Henry Clement claimed that an as
pirant for the honors of the Superior
bench was not permitted to do much In
the way of a speech. He was glad to
nlf . r t everybody, though, and it was evi
dent that they were all glad to meet h!m.
He was cheered to the echo.
Charles F. Curry got lost on his beat
snmr-how or other and dropped in. He
didn't discover that it was a municipal
meeting until he had started to deliver
himself of an opinion on Mr. Maguire.
He apologized, not for the opinion, but
for the mistake, and went on with his
speech upon a vociferous suggestion to do
so from his audience.
"Maguire and I are good friends," said
Mr. Curry. "Maguire's a good fellow, but
he is kind of damned by his political as
pirations and the methods of his noml
nation. He's got four or five nomina
tions now, and it is said that he was
within telephone distance when the Re
publican convention was on, hoping the
boys would get into a row and offer him
that nomination, too."
Speaking of the local issue he said:
"You have got as an opponent to Mr.
Patton a young man who has never
known what it was to earn a dollar. He
was born with money and has spent the
better part of his life trying to forget
how his father made it. He is the sort
of friend of labor that wants labor to
live at the minimum salary, as was
proved when he wanted to cut City Hall
janitors' .salaries from $70 to $40 per
month. He is supported by a paper
whose support no sane man would have.
I want no libertine of Hearst's stamp
supporting me with a sideshow like the
Examiner."
Mr. Curry concluded with a short ex
position of his own case, and was enthu-
Ically cheered.
I). J. Murphy, for District Attorney, fol
lowed Mr. Curry. He dealt at length with
that portion of the Republican platform
that has to do with the interests of the
men to whom he was speaking.
"Even that gibbering sheet of the oppo
sition, the Examiner," said Mr. Murphy,
"has said that the Republican platform
was the fairest and best instrument that
any political party has ever indorsed, and
for once I am inclined to take the Exam
iner's word."
Kis audience stood with him there, and
with their applause stood with him until
his speech was interrupted by the arrival
of genial Henry Martin. Mr. Martin has
the only smile in the party that anywhere
near resembels Julius Kahn's. It was in
working order when he came In. He and
his principles were too well known to
need introduction. He simply said he was
glad he was there, sprung another gloom
breaking smile and sat down to make
room for E. I. Sheehan, who, when the
Martin greeting had sufficiently subsided,
explained that he wanted to be Tax Col
lector, and why.
"Doc" Hawkins, who wants to be Cor
jner again, told his hearers that he hoped
to have them all down to see if they could i
Identify the remains of the Democratic
party on November 9. From the roar
that sent Hawkins to his seat it may be
surmised that most of them will be there.
William A. Deane was classed in
Henry Martin's category. The loudness
of his greeting would not permit of a
speech. He passed muster without say-
Ing a word about "issues" and pledges
and things, and sat down to make way
for W. F. Fitzgerald, who was received
with the same convincing cordiality.
I. J. Truman, who Is mentioned on the
big bills for Treasurer, promised to count
and not "heff the cash in the safe and
to run his office on the same careful prin-
C A. eS C. Berthier, nominee for Recorder;
Judge C. A. Low, Judge Joaehimsen, A.
B. Treadwell and Thomas F. Â«r aha â¢'
who are nominees for Police J^ge*.
wound up the meeting with short intro- {
ductory speech, though it was evident
from the reception they got that nothin*
of the sort was needed.
AUSTRO-AMERICAN DEMOCRATS
Maguire and White Address a Meet
ing in Garibaldi Hall-
The Austro- American democratic
League held a meeting in Garibaldi HaU
last night. The chief "P^^JJJJJ
James G. Maguire and Stephen M. White
Senator White was the first
was forced to stop from time . * Â° "â¢â¢
request a disturbing element the rear
of the hall to subside. They ai
crfre to hear White speak, but the* qua
want to cheer Maguire, and neer mm
they would. Between the breaKs Mr.
White told his hearers that the on v ;
form was the signal for am cf
Mual rights, while every monopoly is on
fhe other side-not one Is supporting our
ticket because they know where their in. j
terests lie. Let every workingman know
that he has no interest in the monoply
and stand up for the grand old principle,
â¢Equal rights to all; special privileges to j
"The meeting was presided over by J. A. j
Arnberger and short speeches were made
by other candidates on the State and leg
slative tickets.
EBE MAYOR AND THE MONEY.
Phelan Speaks to Democrats, but Says
Nothing of His "Hefting"
Methods.
Mayor Phelan and a number of other
Democratic candidates addressed a meet- i
ng at the rooms of the. San Francisco ;
Uhletic Club on Sixth street last evening. ;
Franklin K. Lane, candidate for the of
ice of City and County Attorney, made a ;
engthy speech\ which was well received. ;
Be appealed for the support of the work- '
ngmen, saying that he was once the I
poorest of them all and that he had a
U-mpathv for them born Â«f past hard- ,
*hips. Though the crowd was not of the
largest the amount of noise that was
made when the candidate for Mayor en
"red the room was sufficient to compen- i
ate him for his visit. During the course
5f his address he took occasion to den> |
that he had ever advocated the reduction
at the wages paid by the gas company to j
?he men who' light and clean the street
lamps As a matter of fact, the Ma> or
did advocate the reduction of the wages ,
$ "these, men. as can be proved by compe
tent witnesses, whose testimony Is as
credible as that of the Mayor. He sal,
nothing of the manner in which he
"heftef" the money in the City Treasury,
thereby permitting a dishonest official to
-ob the taxpayers of something m " r^. t . ni l"
[116 000 but he declared that in all things
ie had performed his duty as Mayor to
he best of his ability. Theodore F. Bon
Â»et and other candidates made short ad-
Iresses and were all jvell received.
IN THE FORTY-FOURTH.
Maguire and Barry Promise to Save j
State and Country From Ruin.
The Democrats of the Forty-fourth Dis- j
trlct rallied in Apollo Hall last night j
Maguire was booked for the speaker of j
the evening, but Sam Waller, who acted ]
as chairman, evidently thought there was
some mistake about it and talked tang
and often. When Mr. Maguire arrived ,
there were a number of vacant seats in
the house, but he was greeted with hearty
cheers from those who had waited. He J
said a little about monopolies in general â 
and the Southern Pacific Railroad In par
ticular and pointed out the election of
the Democratic State ticket as the only j
hope for California, and the sending of !
James H. Barry to Congress as the sal
vation for the country. He then wont I
over the names of the candidates and
promised great things for each of tnem,
concluding with a few words of thanks
to James D. Phelan for neglecting his
own Interests to make Maguire speeches
in various parts of the State.
Edward L. Hutchison was then Intro- j
ducfd and spoke of his election as a "sure I
thing." He considers Maguire and him- j
self as elected already.
Stephen M. White. James H. Barry and
other candidates prayed for confusion to i
the Republicans and success to the Dem-
ocrats.
PARADE COMMITTEE.
Two Members of Every Republican i
Club Asked to Attend To
morrow Evening.
The Republican parade committee held
a meeting in the Union League Club's
rooms at the Palace last evening, for the
purpose of making arrangements for a
monster parade.
E. M. Galvin presided and some twenty
five or thirty clubs were represented.
After much discussion the committee as
originally formed was disorganized and a
new committee, presided over by H. rl.r 1 .
Firebaugh, was formed. The new organiza
tion then appointed a committee, com
posed of W. (J. Leale. Dawson Mayer, A. j
O. Perkins. Colonel M. S. Blackburn and j
ex-Governor Salomon, to confer with the j
State Central and County committees, it ]
being the sentiment of the meeting that
co-operation with these committees and
unity in the matter generally was im
perative. It was also decided to invite
two members of every Republican club j
in the city and vicinity to attend the next I
meeting of the committee, which is to be i
held at the same place to-morrow evening
at 8 o'clock.
NOT AN ANARCHIST.
Maguire Denies Some of the State
ments Regarding His Views.
In his tour of the city last night Candi
date Maguire dropped into B^rsaglieri
Hall and addressed a meeting of Demo
crats of the Forty-third District. His
speech was a general tir.-ide against
monopoly rule and a promise of better
things. He said in part: "The majority
of the people are always in favor of and
satisfied with justice, but they don't
always get It. The candidates are aa noth
ing as individuals; It is on the strength
of the principles we represent that we ask
for your votes. I have been called an
anarchist a socialist and a nihilist by my
opponents, and not only do I deny that
I am any of these, but I assert that I do
not believe the parties using these names
know what they really mean. They call
them however, because I am not in favor
of excluding political refugees from our
shores. This has been a campaign of
falsehood and blackguardism against me
and Mr Phelan by the great monopolies."
James A. Devoto was chairman of the
meeting and introduced Stephen M.
Whit" Edward L. Hutchison, Dr. Hill
and others, who made short speeches.
More Big Meetings.
The Republican State Committee has
added four big meetiners to its list to take
place within the next ten days.
There will be an Army and Navy
League meeting at Saratoga Hall to-mor
row evening, and on Thursday evening
Colonel H I Kowalsky will deal with
campaign 'issues at Odd Fellows' Hall.
A rousing mass meeting of German-
American voters is being arranged for the
evening of November 2 to takj place at
Turner Hall on Turk street. On the
same evening George A. Knight, who has
announced his candidacy for the Senate
will address a big meeting of laborers and
mechanics at Metropolitan Temple.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 25, 1898.
DEMOCRATS
NEGLECTED
THE ISSUES
German Central Club
Opens Its Fight.
SPEAKERS WITH GRIEVANCES
ALL PREPARED TO MAKE AND
ANSWER CHARGES.
Maguire Tells of His Relation With
His Party and Says^t's None
of His Opponent's
Business.
The personnel of the Republican
ticket and the motives which prompted
the various candidates to seek the sup
port of the voters of California were
construed, or rather misconstrued, ac
cording to Democratic ideas at Metro
politan Temple last evening. The meet
ing was the first big rally of the Ger
man Democratic Central Club. Many
speakers were enlisted to "enlighten"
the gathering, the enlightenment con
sisting of lauding Democratic candi
dates, grilling Republican candidates,
apologizing for Democratic shortcom
ings and venting latent spleen upon the
head of the corporations.
M. Greenblatt, proprietor of a Ger
man paper, was the first to speak. He
concentrated -his energies in the deliv
ery of an anti-railroad speech, occa
sionally giving vent to the contempt in
which he held Republican newspapers,
and concluded with an effervescent
sentence or two on the multitudinous
virtues of Democracy. Dr. Max Mag
nus folio-wed Mr. Greenblatt in a speech
in his native tongue. This pleased the
German contingent immensely, but the
American more, as the effort was a re
freshing variation. Chris Runckel,
Democratic candidate for Superintend
ent of Schools, H. P. Andrews, candi
date for Attorney General, and Frank
H. Gould followed as named. Mr.
Gmild spoke at length on "the motive
responsible for the interference of the
Southern Pacific in politics."
'The office of Governor is one of vast
importance," he said, "and for many
reasons the railroad has an object in
view when It enters the fight to fill
that office. In event the Legislature
enacted provisions beneficial to that
giant monopoly it is needful to have
one in that chair that will assist the
measure; if the enactment Is inimical
to the interests of the railroad it is
necessary that one should be there
willing to place a veto on any such
measure. The distribution of a patron
age that pays in salaries each year, as
near as 1 can estimate, the round sum
of $1,u00,000, also falls to the lot of the
Governor, and the distribution of that
patronage might assist one who so de
sired to pay his debtsâ his political
debts.
"It is known that no corporation
could get behind James G. Maguire, and j
therefore the people should gather to
his support. The Railroad Commission
and the State Board of Equalization
are offices that require men likewise
willing to see that justice is eriven the
people as well as the railroad. The
Democratic party's candidates cannot
be questioned as to their integrity and
they stand upon this most important
issue."
E. L. Fitzgerald, Democratic candi
date for Public Administrator, next
took the platform and endeavored to
explain how easy it is to be on two
great registers at the same time. He
then retired and was not again in evi
dence. Finlay Cook, candidate for Po
lice Judge, then explained that he had
no desire to drag any of the gathering
to the Police Court, but asked the gath
ering to assist in pushing him into
office. R. P. Doolan, nominee for Super
intendent of Streets, made a brief ad
dress, brief through the fact that just
as he was becoming enthusiastic Mayor
Phelan and James G. Maguire entered
the hal!, and the cheers and enthusiasm
that greeted them drowned the
speaker's voice.
"Three cheers for the standard
bearers of the State and municipal
tickets," was shouted from the gallery.
Phelan and Maguire bowed their recog
nition of the cordial reception tendered
them. Mayor Phelan spoke first. "There
Is much in common between the State
and municipal tickets," he said, "and
when the support of the people is given
one It will not neglect the other." The
speaker then explained a few conditions
he chose to consider issues- and then
branched, taking issue to statements
that have been made, picturing Ma
guire as antagonistic to property inter
ests. He then drifted to the railroad
question, referring to it as "the gigan
tic conspiracy of the railroad." "In
view of this 'conspiracy' the people
should be willing to trust the highest
public office in the gift of the people to
the hands of James G. Maguire.
"We all know his record, and that Is
a sufficient guarantee that he will not
betray the trust imposed upon him.
Gage has no public record, and the peo
ple do not know hew he stands upon
questions of vital importance."
A few more remarks and Mr. Phelan
gave way to Chairman Dr. Max Mag
nus, who Introduced the standard
bearer of Democracy. When the last
cheer had died away Mr. Maguire said:
"I am pleased to meet such a splendid
gathering and to receive such a hearty
welcome. I am pleased to see that you
all feel a deep interest in the issues of
this campaign and realize their great
importance. Being hoarse from con
continued speaking I will not speak on
the Issues of the campaign but rather
choose to reply to those who devote
more of their time to me than to the
current issues.
"To my mind the Issues of the cam
paign involve matters of greater im
portance than men, but It seems that
others hold a different view. lam both
surprised and flattered to find that my
opponents think I am more important
than the issues. They tell the people
that they are afraid that I have-not
been a consistent Democrat. I hÂ»ve
paid but little attention to these re
marks, but now I will state that I con
sider it none of their business. My re
lations with mv party are between my
party and myself, and I care to take
no advice from Gage or Barnes. They
know nothing about Democracy. Now
as to my relations v ith the Democratic
party.
"In 187r>, when I entered public life, I
was nominated as a candidate for the
Legislature and was elected. In 1882 I
was nominated In the regular Demo
cratic convention for Judge of the Su
perior Court and was elected. In 1592,
1894 and 1596 I attended Congress as a
regularly elected Democrat, and In 1898
T seek the office of Governor. I have
been indorsed, It is true, but have never
been elected to any office except to
those referred to. My opponents have
made a mistake. If they wish to abuse
any one they shnulrl abuse tho ppn->ip
who nlaced me in office, and cea c e de
nouncing me." (Laughter.)
The speaker then denounced many
statements he attributed to his op
ponents as falsehoods, gave his opinion
of the mental qualifications of his col
league, Congressman Loud, and con
cluded with the statement that he had
no fear of the coming election, as he
believed the people knew their duty
and would not neglect It. Maguire was
followed by Edward L. Hutchison, can
didate for Lieutenant Governor; Sena
tor Stephen M. White and James H.
Barry. The meeting then adjourned.
MR. HENLEY'S RETICENCE.
The Alien of Mexico Says Nothing of
His Affiliati6n With Emperor
Maximilian.
A well-attended meeting of Democrats
was held at Turn Verein Hall last evening.
The speakers of the evening were: Frank
lin K. Lane, James Denman, Washington
Dodge, L. F. Byington, Rhodes Borden,
E. P. Mogan. John A. Brown, T. J. Lyons,
George H. Cabaniss, R. Porter Ashe, Wil
liam Cannon, Francis Pope, R. P. Doolan,
L. F. Stone and Barclay Henley. The
last-named speaker declared that the is
sue of the present municipal campaign
was that of the bosses on the one side
and honest government on the other. He
promised that if he was elected to the of
fice of District Attorney he would do all
in his power to put the rascals in jail.
He made no reference to the circum
stances that induced him, in 1564, to re
nounce his allegiance to the I T nited
States and become a citizen of Mexico.
The fact that he has never since that time
announced his intention of again becom
ing a citizen of this country was not
mentioned by him as one of the reasons
why he should be elected to the respon
sible office he is now seeking.
W. A. Deane Central Club.
The William A. Deane Central Club held
a big meeting In Cabrillo Hall, Native
Sons' building, last evening, John C. Nob
man presiding. William A. Deane, the
Republican nominee for County Clerk,
was received with three rousing cheers.
Mr. Deane said he was highly pleased
at the enthusiasm of his friends who
were enlisted in his behalf. He said the
outlook for victory was bright. To see
such a large number gathered together
to advance his interests was enough to
make any man proud. Mr. Deane said
he could stay with them only for n
few moments, as he had to go elsewhere,

MAKES A PLEA
FOR STAUNCH
AMERICANISM
Webster Davis Speaks
in Oakland.
GREETED BY A GREAT CROWD
THE ISSUES OF THE CAMPAIGN
CLEARLY OUTLINED.
Voters Should Else Above Party
Prejudices and Stand Together
to Support the Admin
istration,
OAKLAND, Oct. 24.â For a couple of
hours to-night some thousands of peo
ple at the Exposition building were
lifted from the plane of petty politics
and were brought face to face with the
great principles of pure Americanism.
The orator of the evening was Hon.
Webster Davis, and for many days
Oakland will be busy discussing his
speech. The platform was filled with
leading Republicans, and among the
vast audience were hundreds who do
not call themselves Republicans, but all
applauded the speaker's sentences.
When he closed all would like to have
heard more.
Hon. Webster Davis did not plead for
votes for his party. He did not extoll
Republicanism and decry everything
else. He never once mentioned Ma
guir or Magulreism. He delivered an
American address so brc-ad and con
vincing that party doctrine seemed
puerile by comparison. He said in part:
"This is the middle of the administra
tion of President McKinley. During his
term of office the arms of America have
taught the world a lesson. It was not
a Republican war, but a national tri
umph. At this time the eyes of Eu
rope are on the Peace Commission now
in session at Paris. Europe knows as
well as we do that the temper of this
nation regarding the war with Spain
will be shown at the polls two weeks
hence â that the war is really an issue
in this campaign. What shall we say
then if after November 8, America pro
claims to the world that she does not
indorse her war-President, her Dewey,
her Schley. her Sampson, her Hobson,
and her other heroes? And this is what
she will do if the complexion of Con
gress should be changed at this time.
This is a time for citizens to show their
Americanism as much as when Mr. Mc-
Kinley issued a call to arms, and a
quarter of a million of the flower of
our country's manhood responded.
"California, f- - 1 becoming the center
of these United States, surely cannot
hesitate a moment to strengthen the
hands of the administration that
through our boys in blue has planted
the flag of liberty on the isles of the
East and of the West, making possible
a future comn.erce of which we dare
not have dreamed ten -ears ago."
Afro-American League.
A very enthusiastic meeting of the
Afro-American League was held last
night at 620 Bush street. Charles L. Pat
ton, Republican candidate for Mayor, ad
dressed the league and was heartily in
dorsed. The Republican State and
municipal tickets were also indorsed.
Several other candidates addresed the
league. A grand mass meeting will be
held on November 2, at which time the
several candidates will be presented.
AUSTRIAN JUBTLEE MEDALS.
The Emperor of Austria has announced
th;it he will distribute commemorative
medals of three kinds to the population.
The first is for the army, and all who
have worn the Emperor's uniform with
honor have a right to it. The second is
for Government or court service, and the
third fur all persons who have done any
kind of work during the last forty years.
The latter can be applied for by every
class of the population, and by men and
women equally. Before these medals were
struck there must have been profound
consideration as to the Inscriptions they
were to bear. During the Emperor's long
reign several medals and crosses have
been struck to reward merit of various
kinds, and they have always been fur
nished with simple inscriptions.
The medal for soldiers who have shown
courage before the enemy has the In
scription "Dor Tapferkeit" (for bravery);

TEN MILLION DOLLABo FOft A
SERVANT.
The death has occurred In Vienna of
Ferdinand Llnke, the king of Austrian
usurers, and a conspicuous figure in
Viennese life.
Linke started a money lending business
in ISfiO with a capital of Â£10, and by the
exorbitant rates of interest which he
charged, as "well as the callousness with
which he extracted his pound of flesh
from his vietime, he soon amassed a
large fortune, and died worth over Â£2,
000,000.
Linke's methods frequently exceeded
the limits of the law, and he was sen
tenced to several terms of imprisonment,
amounting in all to upward of eight
years. His passion for usury, however,
remained uncooled, and on his release
from prison he always returned to his
work with renewed zeal. In his private
life the usurer was eccentric in the ex
treme. He kept one man over 80 years
old to manage the household affairs, and
lived as If he were in need of the neces
of life. He clos.ely barred his doors and
windows, and had a body guard of fierce
bloodhounds.
After his death several hundred thou
sand pounds in banknotes and gold were
found hidden under the floor, in carefully
concealed holes in the wall, and other cu
rious places.
His daughter is the sole heiress to the
usurer's immense fortune. She has lived
in perfect ignorance of her father's
wealth, and h* earned her living as a do
mestic servant. When she inherited her
fortune of $10,000,000 she was maid-of-all
work in a struggling tradesman's house,
with an annual wage of $20.
Linke has imposed on hts heiress one
very characteristic condition â viz., that no
portion of the inheritance shall at any
time be devoted to charitable purposes. â

IN PLACE OF A GRINDSTONE.
Boys who think it hard to be compelled
to turn the grindstone should, instead,
be thankful that they have things so easy
as they do. The Six Towns Times, in its
sketches from Windham history, tells
how Duncan Mclntosh, who settled some
where about 1750. brought with him from
Portland a new scythe which he neglect
ed to sharpen before he left that place.
and when his first crop of hay w r as ready,
to harvest he found that there was no'
grindstone nearer than the old Province
Fort at South Windham. a distance of
four or five miles. Not wishing to spare
the time to go that distance he decided to
do the next best thing, so he made a
dozen flat pine sticks, took a pot or
grease and his scythe down to the beach,
in front of his house, greased the sticks,
sprinkled them liberally with sand and
actually rubbed hts scythe to a sharp
edge. Afterward when questioned as to>
the amount of labor and length of time
required for this unique operation he re
plied that it was no great affair, as it
took him only one day to get his scythe
into good cutting order. â Kennebec Jour

with three cycling clergymen, by whom
he was drawn into conversation. When
they discovered who he was one of the

DR. A. T. SANDENâ Dear Sir: The
belt received from you some time ago has
proved a Godsend to me. It has done
wonders for me and has put my wife in
better health than she has been for years.
She has gained in strength and feels as
good as she could wish. It has complete-
ly cured me of seminal weakness and am
strong in everv wav, and feel as well
as I ever did. The belt has done what
doctors and patent medicines have failed
to do, and think it a cheap cure as I had
spent over |200 trying to get relief for
myself and wife. I feel very grateful,
for God only knows what I suffered before
trying the belt. I had about given up
hope and was sick and tired of trying
different things with the same result. I
cannot tell you how I feel toward you,
but will do all I possibly can to make
known the good I have received from
vour belt and advice. You can use this
letter as you like and can refer any one
to me you wish, and I will easily prove
what I say is true. Wishing your belt
the success it deserves. I remain, yours
very truly, *. W. YELNIC.

BETRAYED BY PIE-HUNTERS.
â¦*Jâ ) ETRAYED by pie-hunters" is the phrase
Dused by J. V. Webster in describing the
manner in which the Populist party has been
duped by the Maguire fusionists. It is a striking
phrase and a true one. The only common interest be
tween the parties to the fusion was a desire for office;
or. in the expressive slang of the day, a desire for
"pie." Between genuine Populism and genuine Dem
ocracy there is a wide gulf, but between the self-seek
ers who last summer obtained control of the ma
chinery of both organizations there is the solidarity of
self-interest. Principles were sacrificed for personal
profit.
Mr. Webster, who was the Populist nominee for
Governor four years ago, stands with Mr. Shanahan
the nominee of the honest Populists in this campaign
and refuses to give even the consent of silence to the
betrayal of his party by the pie-hunters. He sees in
the fusion trick a menace to the whole future of Popu
lism, and is aware that if the party is to be saved and
its principles maintained, earnest and sincere Populists
must unite to break to pieces at the polls the corrupt
bargain made at Sacramento.
It is notable that both Mr. Webster and Mr. Shana
han lay special stress upon the absurdity of making a
single-taxer the nominee of the Populist party.
Maguire has been so erratic a politician, has had so
many varieties of policy, has shifted back and forth
in and out of the Democratic party so often, it might
be supposed some portion of his career, some frag
ment of his creed, would be found to correspond with
the fundamental principles of Populism. Such, how
ever, is not the case. Maguire has been everything
by turns except a Populist The whole course of his
checkered career has been antagonistic to Populism
and to the farming interests which that organization
represents.
The menace of the single tax is by Maguire's can
didacy made too clear to be mistaken. As Mr. Webster
puts it: "Mr. Magfeire's idea of taxation would drive
the farmers out of business and would quickly put
their farms into the hands of bankers and mortgage
holders. I cannot conceive of any system of taxation
that would be more agreeable to the Southern Pacific
and many large corporations than the singie tax. If
Mr. Maguire i> anxious to know how the farmers re
gard his single tax ideas he should go upon a few of
the ranches of San Luis Obispo and Kern counties
and talk to the men who own them."
The whole situation is that Populism has not only
been sold out. but it hns been delivered into the hands
of its worst enemy. The party of the farmer has been
turned over to the man who denounces the land
owijef as a monopolist of the worst kind, a robber of
humanity, a violator of the law of Gnd. "Is it any
â wonder," snys Mr. Webster, "that many Populists
have made up their minds that there is a better pros
pect of relief through electing Mr. Gage than by per
petuating the insincere official career of Mr.
Maguire?"
The pie-hunters have committed the betrayal and
made the trade with the single-taxer, but they can
not deliver the goods.
SIGNIFICANT FIGURES.
IU AYOR PHELAN must have had cold shivers
/ \ last night when he read the result of the can
* * vass made by the Report. As a matter of pub
lic interest that paper had sent representatives out to
the eighteen Assembly districts of the city to gather
through the medium of a ballot the sentiment regard
ing Phelan and Patton as candidates for Mayor. The
canvass was confined to the business portions of each
district, and here the Phelan strength is supposed to
lie; yet the total was practically a tie, Phelan receiv
ing sÂ°"B votes and Patton 5056.
A few short weeks ago Phelan thought there was
no opposition worth mentioning, and other people so
far agreed with him as to fear none could be found to
lead for the Republicans what was considered a for
lorn hope. Mr. Patton was appealed to. and consented
to enter the race. Now the whole aspect is changed.
In the residence portion of the city, among the small
shopkeepers, the laborers, Patton is distinctly in the
lead. The followers of Phelan depended largely upon
the "solid" business men, the citizens who had great
financial interests and who had confidence in the
Mayor. It was this class of citizens who were visited
by the Report canvassers. They have given their ver
dict. Among them sentiment is equally divided,
whereas a short time ago it was practically all for the
Mayor's re-election.
ft may be fairly stated that Phelan is losing in his
strongholds and, gaining nothing elsewhere. These
figures show that save for some circumstance, now
wholly unexpected, his cause is lost.
Mrs. Botldn is to be congratulated. A trial in Cali
fornia for murder is not apt to be a serious affair.
THE MAGUIRE OF RECORD.
THE land-owners of California need to consider
well whether they want a man for Governor who
has shown such hatred and spite toward them
and has persistently, for years, charged them with re
sponsibility for every crime that is committed by men,
as has Maguire. If he has believed what he has said
on the subject of land confiscation and in abuse of
land-owners, he is their virulent enemy and believes
them to be the cause of all the economic ills that beset
society. In November, 1885, he made a speech in this
city in which he used this language:
"There is a greater evil than Chinese immigration
preying upon labor which the people must discover
and destroy. The great evil which blasts and scourges
our social life, which produces our industrial depres
sions, which robs the producing classes for the benefit
of the non-producer, which gives wealth to the idle,
and brings the specter of poverty to the door of in
dustry, which within thirty years has locked up the
natural resources of California and reduced her labor
ing classes to pauperism, is none other than the grim
monster â private ownership of land. The iron hand
of land-ownership must be rom away from the white
throat of Liberty or she must perish forever from her
chosen land."
Here we have the land-owner held up asi
"Worse than Chinese coolies."
"Blasting our social life."
"Scourging our social life."
"Producing industrial panics."
"Robbing the producing classes."
"Making the idle rich."
"Impoverishing industry."
"Pauperizing the laborer."
"A grim monster."
"Choking the white throat of Liberty."
It is doubtful whether an equally awful list of crimes
ana offenses was ever charged against any class be
fore.
It will be observed that, like all of his denuncia
tions of land-owners, these serious charges are not
backed by any proofs. It is simply, "I, Maguire, say,"
that the land-owner is a scourge, a robber and a mon
opolist!
If a candidate for office had expressed himself in
terms of equal accusation and abuse of mechanics they
would regard his elevation to the Governorship with
justifiable apprehension and would unite against him.
If Maguire sincerely believes all these things of the
land-owner he owes to his conscience the duty of
doing whatever a Governor's influence may do to de
stroy land-ownership. If the land-owner is worse than
the Chinese coolie opposition to Chinese immigration
is a secondary matter, and the land-owner should be
suppressed first. If the land-owner is blasting and
scourging our social life, bringing on panics, robbing
the producer, impoverishing industry and pauperizing
the laborer, as Maguire says he is, then the land
owner is the most pernicious person in the com
munity, and Maguire will fail of his duty if he fail to
suppress him.
But, worse than all this, Maguire says the land
owner has an iron hand and uses that metallic member
fooling around the white throat of Liberty and threat
ening to choke her! Surely, then, it is time to ring
the tocsin and put a stop to this. Maguire is always
seeing Liberty in all kinds of scrapes. In his book on
"Ireland and the Pope" he had Liberty snake-bit by
the Pope, whom he called the "Serpent of the Vati
can." Between being choked and snake-bitten
Maguire puts Liberty in a position where she is en
titled to the protection of the police.
WORKING THE PEOPLE fIGAIN.
ONCE more the Examiner has set about working
the people for money. Once more it invokes
contributions from the masses, and as usual
says nothing about a rake-off. This time the appeal
is for funds for the Democratic campaign. It is politi
cal boodle that the blackmailing boodler is now after.
The appeal coming just at this time is significant.
The exposure made by The Call of the discrepancy
between M% Phelan's sworn statement that his expen
ditures in the last canvass had been $250, and the fact
that he had disbursed more than that sum for a single
newspaper, has evidently frightened that wealthy boss
into closing his sack. There is to be no more money
from Phelan this year. The Examiner has to look
elsewhere for coin, and, with the facility of a prac
ticed faker, it turns to the old familiar trade of work
ing the people.
To the public under these circumstances The Call
has a contribution to make, not of money, but of ad
vice. The Examiner says it wishes $5000. Now, un
der a contract it had with the Southern Pacific Com
pany, that corporation still owes the Examiner $8000,
according to the Examiner's statement. If, therefore,
the paper and its party is in need of coin just now, it
should sue the corporation for the balance due on the
advertising contract and spare the dear people.
The intelligent mind of Mr. Hearst cannot fail to
perceive how sweet would be the revenge and how
poetic the justice of making the Southern Pacific
Company pay up $8000 as a contribution to the
Maguire campaign fund. If the corporation in its
wickedness should refuse to pay the Examiner could
win glory by suing, not for the sake of the filthy lucre,
but for the purpose of raising funds for the party of its
love.
We advise the people to put nothing into the Ex
aminer hat. The Southern Pacific should be made to
contribute to the Maguire canvass all it owes to
Hearst. What is the advantage to the Democratic
party to have a blackmailing organ if the organ raises
money by wheedling its friends instead of by threaten
ing its foes?
Evidently the military authorities do not view with
entire respect the decision of the courts in the case of
Private Meadors. The man had been acquitted of
murder, the ground being self-defense, and was at
once thrown into the guardhouse for conduct preju
dicial to military discipline. Even deference for dis
cipline would not compel a soldier to refrain from
defending himself, and it may therefore be concluded
that the army has not been impressed by the verdict
of the jury.

THE SAST FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 25, 1898.
Q STRIKING contrast exists between the attitude
Mof Charles L. Patton as a candidate for Mayor
and that of his opponent. It is a contrast which
illustrates the difference in the characters of the two
men and shows how diverse are their motives in seek
ing the Mayoralty. It is therefore a significant feat
ure of the canvass, and one that should not be over-
looked or passed without consideration by the voters.
Mr. Patton was not an office seeker at the hands of
the Republican convention. Mr. Phelan was so eager
an office seeker he would not trust his nomination to
his fellow-Democrats, but procured it from two irre-
sponsible bodies: a self-constituted convention call
ing itself Democratic and another self-constituted con
vention calling itself Non-Partisan.
When the nomination was offered Mr. Patton by
the Republicans he stated that while he is willing to
fulfill any duty to which his fellow-citizens call him,
he would not be a candidate except upon a platform
of policies which in his judgment would advance the
interests of the community. Mr. Phelan, seeking
nominations from two conventions, did not concern
himself aboiit the platform of either of them. He did
not stop to consider what policies the two proposed,
or whether they agreed with one another. He took
the nominations greedily. All platforms look alike
to him.
From these contrasted incidents any person of or
dinary intelligence can discern moral and mental dif
ferences between the two men of no little importance
to voters who are called upon to determine which of
the two shall be intrusted with the chief executive
office of the city. It is a choice between a man seek
ing the public welfare and willing to accept office
only on terms that will enable him to promote that
welfare and another man seeking office careless of
public interests and policies and eager only to ad
vance his political fortunes.
Phelan has in fact become an office seeker of the
most rabid type. It is not the welfare of San Fran
cisco that he is working for in his political ventures.
He has his mind on the United States Senatorship,
and would use the Mayoralty of San Francisco as a
stepping stone to that position just as he used the
Committee of One Hundred as a stepping stone to the
boss-ship of the Democratic party.
Mr. Patton represents principles. Phelan repre
sents egotism. Patton stands for the advancement of
the city; his opponent stands for the advancement of
Phelan. Mayor Patton in office would work honestly
for the public good; Mayor Phelan in office would
work all the patronage of the place to win a Senator
ship. Mr. Patton would not accept a nomination even
from his own party except upon a platform he ap
proved; Phelan accepted nominations from any sort
of party, or faction or gang, upon any kind of plat
form or no platform. Mr. Patton is the defender of
popular interests and good government; his oppo
nent is the exemplar of Phelanism.
THE DONS AND THE DEMOCRATS.
RECENT dispatches from Paris are to the effect
that the Spanish Commissioners at the peace
conference are fighting for delay in the set
tlement of every point at issue in the belief that the
American people are opposed to the claims made by
the administration, and that after the elections Presi
dent McKinley will modify his demands and make
peace on terms more in accord with Spanish desires.
This belief on the part of the Spanish is founded on
the bitterness of the attacks made upon the President
by the Democrats and the yellow journals. The loud
clamors of denunciation against the War. Depart
ment and the administration generally have been ac
cepted by the foolish Spaniards as the voices of the
American people. One of the first results from these
tactics of Democracy, therefore, is delay in the peace
negotiations. For a little while longer commerce
and industry are to be hampered by uncertainty with
respect to our foreign relations because Democracy is
making one of its usual unpatriotic campaigns.
The Democratic masses are, of course, as patriotic
in their intentions as are the Republican masses. Un
fortunately, intentions count for little in this world.
It is not the intention but the word spoken and the
action performed that produce effects. In this case
the words and the actions of Democracy have af
fected European opinion injuriously to the United
States. They have confirmed the Spaniards in their
belief that the people of this country are not united,
and have strengthened them in a determination to
hold out against the just claims of our Government
in the settlement of the war.
If such injury has been done by the campaign ora
tory of Democracy, it is certain that far greater evils
would result from anything like Democratic success
at the polls. With a sweeping Republican victory
the peace negotiations would be brought to a close
in short order. The Spanish Commissioners would
then perceive that they have been living in a delu
sion, that the American people are united, and that
the country supports the President in his peace policy
as well as in the conduct of the war.
Under such conditions every patriot will see the
importance of sustaining the administration in this
campaign and in this crisis. This is our first war
with a European power since 1812 â the first time we
have been brought into something of antagonism to
European diplomacy. The great nations will watch
to see how we bear ourselves in the emergency. A
defeat of the administration will lead Europe to re
gard us as a fickle people, and therefore a nation in
capable of carrying out a great policy consistently and
persistently in the face of opposition. Such an im
pression would injure us in more ways than one.
Policy as well as patriotism demands of the people
a Republican victory at this juncture.

fl STRIKING CONTRAST.
MR. PHELAN, THE GREAT MOGUL.
Tne Plug-Hat Boss Aims to Plant His Feet on the Necks
ol the People.
NUMBER THREE.
Dear Sir: The campaign cry of Mr. Phelan, and of those who ha\e
bound themselves to support his policy, is: "If we must have a boss, let
him be one elected by the people." The founders of the republic thought
differently. They considered that it would be a menace to popular rights
to give any man elected by the people such power that he could be a boss.
Therefore they multiplied offices and instituted a system of checks ana
balances so that no official could have his own way. To their minds many
incidents were still fresh to prove that the power given by the people might
be used against the people. ' We have forgotten these incidents, but they
had burned into the souls of our "forefathers a dread and horror of such a
possibility. The Government they established was for the plain people, for
you and for me, and they thought it were better that the most elaborate
policies should fall rather than that your rights and mine should be
placed in Jeopardy.
But why bring up these deep questions of statesmanship now? All that
has been settled long ago. It is impossible now to rob the people of their
rights. There is no danger for us.
What is has been, and what has been shall be. Peoples have lost
their freedom before this, and they lost it because they thought there was
no danger. When we read history we can put our finger on the precise date
when freedom ceased. But we are looking backward. The people who
then lived could not see it. When the Roman republic was changed into an
empire not a jot or tittle of its constitution was altered. The old offices
remained, the old Senate, the old judiciary. The only change made was that
one man controlled them all..
ETERNAL VIGILANCE
Is the price of liberty, and if ever it behooved men to be vigilant now is
the time. Our fathers knew by experience that power corrupts, and that
the power of the people may be used against the people. If we but open
our eyes we shall see that the same experience is not absent from our
own lives.
When Mr. Phelan came Into power he came into power as the exponent
of the idea of a strong government. As Mayor his powers are limited and
defined by the law. His constant complaint has been that the Mayor's of
fice has not enough power. Now there may well be an honest difference
of opinion as to the amount of power that should be given to a Mayor. The new
charter increases his authority somewhat; the opponents of the new charter
would deny him that increase. Good men differ on the pomt â men who
are plain citizens and have no political aspirations and are looking solely
to the conservation of their rights.
But the new charter and every charter that is constitutional preserves
the fundamental distinction of powers in the government. The judiciary
does not depend upon the Mayor. The Supervisors are elected directly by
the people. The executive functions are not monopolized by one man, they
are parceled out among certain officials, each of whom is responsible to
the voters. Hence there is no difference of opinion between those who
favor the charter and those who do not, as to the necessity of the division
of power. They all agree on the American principle that there must be in
our government checks and balances to protect the rights of the plain
citizen â your rights and mine.
MR. PHELAN CAME INTO OFFICE.
As an advocate of a strong government. His ideas would naturally be in
terpreted by the terms of the charter he supported. But power speedily
corrupts, and the power of the people may be used against the people. Mr.
Phelan wanted to do something. In his mind, no doubt, what he wanted
to do would benefit the city. But he who steals the people's power to ben
efit the people does the people a deadly wrong. In order for him to carry
out his plans it was necessary for him to control the other co-ordinate
branches of the government. He began with the Supervisors. Mr. Phelan
is a man of talent. He has an observing mind. He marks how men gain
ascendency over others. His philosophy is materialistic and he believes
that the way to a man's heart is through his stomach. He dined the Su
pervisors, he wined them, he cigared them, he introduced them, some of
them for the first time, with saucer eyes and palpitating hearts to the lux
ury and taste which he can afford to gratify. But either Mr. Phelan was
too much of a novice or he did not continue the process long enough to
reach their hearts. There are other influences, and it was soon evident that
the Supervisors were not in his control. They preferred to differ from
him. Whether they were right or wrong does not touch the question.
The fact remains he was not able to attain to more power than that al
lowed him by the law.
But the power of the people nriay be turned against the people. After
all, the Supervisors are the representatives of the people as much as the
Mayor. If the people are not satisfied with them, the people have re
served the remedy in their own hands. They did not delegate it to Mr.
Phelan. They gave Mr. Phelan certain authority to be used in a certain
manner. They never authorized him to use that authority to curtail their
own privileges. To turn the rascals out is a power the people keep for
themselves. They have not yet learned to trust it In the hands of any one
man.
BUT STILL THE POWER OF THE PEOPLE
May be used against the people. When it comes to a question of the
misuse of power the people are very jealous. They look upon the law
making branch of the government as closer to them than any other branch.
Their practice is to put the power of Impeachment among the attributes of
this branch. If the President iocs wrong Congress may impeach him.
The President cannot impeach Co_ngress or dissolve it. Even when im
peachment proceedings take place they are seldom If ever successful. The
people are so jealous of the encroachments of one division of the govern
ment on another that public opinion has usually quashed impeachment pro
ceedings, except in one or two cases of notorious drunkenness or incompe
tency.
But the power of the people may be used against the people. Mr.
Phelan was not troubled with popular scruples about the limits of his
power. If he could not control the Board of Supervisors he might get rid
of It. By an alliance with another branch of the government, the judi
ciary, he might be able to end what he could not mend. Again, over a
dinner, for Mr. Phelan is partial to dinners, the plan was discussed and
matured. The Supervisors were adroitly led into what was supposed to
be a technical breach of the law. The machinery was ready to strike. Be
fore the decision was rendered Mayor Phelan knew of it and was pro
pared. The Board of Supervisors was thrown out of office. Guilty and
guiltless, majority and minority, all came under the same condemnation
and before the echoes of the decision had ceased from the courtroom a
Board of Supervisors controlled by Mayor Phelan was in office.
SUPPOSE THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS
Was as black as it Mas painted, yet this action was an attack on popular
rights. When Charles I went into the English Legislature and demanded
the members whom he considered far more guilty than the Supervisors were
ever said to be, he was met by the resistance of a people jealous of their
liberty and he paid the penalty on the block. When Oliver Cromwell halted
his troopers in the lobby of the Long Parliament he said to the members,
"Get you gone; give place to horrestcr men, to those who will more faithfully
discharge their trust." He may have thought he was acting for the good
of the people, but history dates from that day the beginning of a despot
ism far more injurious to the people than the Long Parliament had ever
been. When Congress was quarreling with Andrew Johnson one of the
most famous generals of the civil war proposed to take a company of sol
diers and clean the legislature out. If that hot-headed measure had been
adopted we should have had a civil war in every city and town and hamlet
of the Union.
Mr. Phelan's action toward the Board of Supervisors was precisely of
the same nature. He used the power of the people to suppress a co-ordi
nate branch of the government. Of course it was on a smaller scale and
it was not accomplished by military force. But it is a big question in
municipal politics; it is a big question for the plain citizenâ for you and
for me. It was accomplished by collusion with aonther branch of the gov
ernment and a squad of policemen can clear the board room as effectively as
a squad of soldiers.
Luckily for the plain citizenâ for you and for meâ Mr. Phelan did not con
trol all of the judiciary. The State Judges were not willing- to lend them
selves to Mr. Phelan's ends and his methods were characterized as revo
lutionary and unconstitutional.
BUT MR. PHELAN KNEW BETTER.
The power of the people may be used against the people. Mr Phelan mp P t o
the decision of the Supreme Court by the war cry, "Give me Jud*e<Ttw
will support my policy. This city can cast the deciding vote in the eleotin
of the Supreme Bench. Cast that vote for men who will support m* Â«i!?

read it every morning before going to

notice a piece about people making
purses and belts out of human skin.
The article was about that poor young
girl at the edge of death. Those young
ladies coming to buy her skin. Just
think how she must feel to know that
she must be skinned when she is dead.
It is perfectly horrible. What will peo
ple do next? I was so disgusted with
reading about those fools that I
stopped. People who haven't any more
sense than to buy the skin of human
beings should be themselves skinned
alive. People will be frying human
beings for breakfast next. Oh, how sick

A NEMESIS OF
MR, DEUPREY?
More Facts of the
Piedmont Mystery.
TALK OF A CRAZY CLIENT
A WRECKED OFFICE AND DISIN
CLINATION TO EXPLAIN.
Belief That the Hat and Purse Were
Subterfug-es and That the
Woman Is Still
Alive.
Mysterious circumstances surround
Mrs. Mamie Miller. She lived at one time
at 363 Prospect avenue, Oakland, and Is
supposed to have committed suicide last
Saturday night by jumping from the
steamer Piedmont.
A woman answering to the description
of Mrs. Miller, who from reputation and
appearance was well known on both sides
of the bay, was seen to take the 11:15
o'clock boat for Oakland on Saturday
night, but no one, and many have been
closely questioned, remember seeing the
woman leave the boat after it reached
Its destination.
A woman answering to the description
of Mrs. Miller was seen to enter one of
the ladies' retiring rooms on the boat.
When the usual search of the boat was
made, which is done after every trip,
there was found in the room in which the
woman was Been to enter a dark felt hat
with large feathers, a pocketbook con
taining a pawn ticket, a plain gold ring
and a handkerchief.
The pawn ticket established the fact
that the woman had on Saturday after
noon borrowed money on a child's ring
and had given her address as Mrs. Miller,
3SJ Protpect avenue, Oakland. It was
learned that the Mrs. Miller who lived at
S'J3 Prospect avenue, Oakland, has not re
sided there for some time, which proves
that the woman gave the wrong address.
That this woman or some woman answer
ing to her description committed suicide
by Jumping from the Piedmont is
strengthened by the fact that no woman
would be apt to get off a boat and
leave behind her her hat. pocketbook and
handkerchief. The police are coniident
th it the woman committed suicide and
that her body now lies at the bottom of
the bay.
Tlhs Mrs. Miller, and the facts are con
clusive in their proof that it was she
who sought death in a watery grave, had
on several occasions made herself con
spicuous in the press. Her escapades
were of the tenderloin love affair nature.
In connection with the case has been
linked the name of Lawyer Eugene N.
Deuprey. The facts connecting the name
of the attorney with that of Mrs. Miller
are as follows:
On last Friday or Saturday night "W.
E. Dennis, who for a number or years
has been employed at the Oakland race
track, and who knows Mr. Deuprey, in
company with his brother, Lincoln Den
nis, and Charles Jamison, was passing up
Market street about 10:30 o'clock. As
they passed the western end of the Par
rott building, Dennis noticed Mr. Deu

ern entrance, just outside the swinging
doors. In company wtlh a woman. He
called his brother's and friend's attention
to the fact, lit-cause the woman was talk
ing in an excited manner and was gesti
culating witn her right hand.
The next day when Dennis read an ac
count of the suicide he made the remark j
that it might be the woman that he saw j
Mr. Deuprey talking to. This got out and
Dennis thought it best to go and see Mr.
Deuprey as a friend and explain the facts.
He called on him yesterday afternoon and
ptated what he had seen and of the re
mark that he had made. Dennis declares
that Mr. Deuprey said to him. "Yes, she
was a crazy client of mine and I don't
care if I never see her again. I was at
tending to some correspondence for her.
I have not peen her for some time. She
wanted to come to my office to see mo.
but 1 would not permit her." Dennis
then told Mr. Deuproy that he would not
mention the matter and the lawyer
thanked him.
Yesterday afternoon Mr. Deuprey was
seen at his office by a Call representative
and asked if he had made the statements
that Dennis credited to him. He em
phatically denied that he had made any
such statements to Dennis as ;were cred
ited to him, and added that Dennis had
visited him purely for the purpose of in
stituting blackmail.
Dennis was seen after the interview
with Mr. Deuprey, and when told of the
fact that the lawyer had discredited
what he had said, offered to go to Mr.
Deupr^y's residence and face him with
the statement that he had made. Dennis
accompanied The Call reporter to Mr.
Deuprey's residence, but he was not at
home.
One significant fact occurred when the
reporter rang the door bell. The woman
who opened the door asked if the visitor
was a reporter, and on being informed
that such was the case said: "You have
come to see Mr. Deuprey about the wo
man that committed suicide, and I hope
that you won't put anything about it In
the papers."
Anotiier coincidence connects Mr. Deu
prey with Mrs. Miller, and it is the
strongest link in the evidence tending to
scow that the lawyer knew the sukide,
and that for some reason his relations
with her were anything but pleasant. !
Shortly before the Democratic convention i
at Sacramento Mrs. Miller visited Mr.
Deuprey's office in the Parrott building.
The clerks had instruction not to admit i
her Into bis private office, but despite this !
Fhe forced her way there. She had not
been In the office very long before angry !
voices were heard, and presently Sir.
Deuprey came out, followed by Uie
woman' who was heaping abuse upon him.
She then began to break up the furniture,
and finally threw a cuspidor at Mr. Deu
prey. Efforts to eject her from the omce
were useless, and to the consternation of
the clerks the woman began to disrobe.
A policeman was called in, and when ne
arrived Mrs. Miller was in almost a nude
state. She then sprang into the window,
and would have hurled herself into Uie
street below If tho oflicer had not prevent
ed her. Finally she was overpowered and
made to dress and was taken from the
office, but no charges were preferred
against her. Mr. Deuprey is reported to
have told the officer not to prefer charges
against the woman. At the time it was
said the woman was insane.
The story of t li<- scene in the office
leaked out while Mr. Deuprey was at
tending the Democratic convention at
Sacramento, and when he was seen in re
gard to the matter by the correspondent
of The Ckill he denied having any knowl
edge of the. woman having committed a
scene in her office or of her having broken
any furniture. All that he said was that
he knew the woman and that she was a
crazy client. m .

Major Edie Petums to Care for the
Sick and Claim His Bride.
IT Is with a double pleasure that Surgeon Major Guy L. Edle of the
United States Volunteers is journeying to this city from the East to
assume charge of the Division Hospital. Not only has hs ability been
recognized in that he has been placed at the head of the Division Hospital,
which means that he will succeed to the control of the General Military
Hospital that Is to be erected,
but Major Edle has also the
pleasant realization that he is
.coming' to the city of his lady
love, whom, early In De
cember, he will lead to the
altar. A few days ago society
received with pleasure the an
nouncement of the engagement
of Major Edie to Miss Clemen
tine Kipp, one of the most
charming and popular of San
Francisco's many charming
girls. The exact day of the wed
ding has not been determined
upon, but It will occur some
time during the early winter.
Major Edie is a native of Vir
ginia, and is a graduate of the
University of Virginia, where he
was a classmate of Dr. Hopkins
of this city. In ISS3 he entered
the army, and five years later
was commissioned a captain and
assistant surgeon. When the
war broke out Major Edie was
in Alaska, but was ordered
home and sent to the East for
duty with the rank of major of
volunteers. When it was decided
to build the general military
hospital here Colonel Middleton, chief surgeon of the department, se
lected Major Edie as the officer for the head of the hospital. He has been
ordered here, and win for the present relieve Major Matthews from duty at
the Division Hospital, as the latter has applied for a sick leave. Major
Edie will reach here this week.
Personally the major is a gentleman of charming individuality. He is ex
ceedingly approachable, and his easy and kind manners have made a host
of friends for him both in and out of the army.

that he owed him that amount for saving
the woman's life. Many people who are
familiar with the case are of the opinion
that the hat and pocketbook and handker

to leave for reasons not known.

BARELY MANAGED IT.
The following story is commonly re
lated as true in France. Old Harpagon
was fast approaching his end. His suf
ferings were very great, but he com
forted himself with the thought that as
he could not eat there was so much
saved, at any rate.
"Well, doctor," he said, In a feeble
voice, "how long have I yet to live?"
"Only half an hour. Would you like
me to send for somebodyâa clergyman,
for Instance?"
Harpagon was silent for a few mo
ments; he passed his hand over his
chin, bristling with a grizzly beard of
several days' growth, when a sudden
thought struck him, and turning to the
doctor he gasped excitedly:
"Quick âsend for âfor a barber!
The barber soon afterward arrived
with his shaving tackle.
Harpagon, whose voice "was getting
weaker, asked him: ''Youâcharge
twopenceâfor shaving?"
"That's the Trice," was the answer.
"Andâhow muchâis Itâfor shavingâ
a corpse?"
The barber paused a moment, and
then said, "Five shillings."
"Thenâshaveâmeâ quickly," stam
mered old Harpagon, casting a feverish
glance at the watch which the doctor
still held in his hand.
He was too feeble to utter another
word, but the doctor understood the
mute appeal and said:
"Fifteen minutes more!"
A smile of satisfaction stole over the
features of the patient. The barber set
to work and in a very short time fin
ished his task, notwithstanding the
nervous twitchings that distorted the
face of the dying man. When i~ i oper
ation was over old Harpagon uttered a
sigh of relief and was heard to whisper:
"That's a good thingâfour shillingsâ
and ten pence âsaved!" and he breathed
his last.
THE CROWN OF THORNS.
The thorny nature of much of the vege
tation of Palestine must have been a sub
ject of remark to the early pilgrims from
Europe; the underwood is dry and prick
ly numerous small gray spinous bushes of
paterlum. hawthorn, bramble, dog rose,
! buckthorn and the like abound, while the
' very oaks, as well as the acacias, are
prickly. There would be no long search
needed to obtain material for our Lord's
'â â  crown of pain. The ordinary white thorn,
or hawthorn, would bfcless likely to have
. been actually employ*, since the difficul
ty of adapting any but the shorter sprays
: to the purpose, for the tree gets its botan
ical name of Crataegus from the Greek
! word for strength, in allusion to the
toughness of its wood. It may have been
i one among the handful of various thorns
gathered, and It belongs to the same fam
ily as the apple, the traditional fruit, in
many lands, of the tree of the fall, and
therefore there was a poetical appllcabll
' ity in making it furnish this instrument of
suffering to the Saviour. At Toulouse,
1 moreover, they preserve a thorn as a relic
' from the crown which has been closely
, examined by the learned professor M. de
1 Cloos. who considers It to be a species of
â  Syrian Cratatgus. Signor Pletro Savi of
Pisa has also seen It, and is of the same
â¢ opinion. Barthollnus thought that some
! such white thorn formed part, at least, of
i the thorns collected for the purpose, and,
i of course, there is no reason why only one
species should have been used.
The Norman peasant of this day wears
: a sprig of hawthorn in his cap from the
' belief that it was once upon his Saviour's
j brow, and this notion was very prevalent
, in medieval times. Many of its names will
show this, such as Christdorn. still heard
in Silesia; Calavru or Calaviru in Sar-
I dinia; La Sainte or La Noble Epine In
' France; Hag, Halig or noly thorn in Eng-
I land, Denmark and Scandinavia, while Its
i fruit and early leaves have also many sa
i cred associations. It Is a common rustic
I eaying that "the hawthorn groans on
â  Good Friday night." as if still mindful of
! the share one of its genus was forced to
' take in the day's sad events; and nl Ire-
I land these trees are the "Monument
; Bushes." beneath which, formerly, the
I unbaptized children were burled, and up
on passing which the peasant uncovers
! his head and repeats the "De profundis"
psalm.â American Catholic Quarterly Re-

TAPESTRIES OF NORWAY.
The traditions of tapestry weaving have
descended from mother to daughter since
the days of the \ ikings in Norway. In
all the mountain farmhouses of the pres
ent day in Norway weaving is still car
ried on as part of the regular housework
ar.d girls are employed to do nothing else.
In the early days It was the work of
the Vikings' wives and daughters to make
large tapestries telling the story of the
conquests made by their family heroes.
These were hung in the great halls of
every home, together with the war weap
ons of the husband and the sons, and the
tapestries are said to have been very
beautiful. Only vegetable dyes were used,
and, while they lacned brilliancy, they
made up for it in durability. A castle in
Denmark contained a few of these rare
specimens till a few years ago, when it
burned down.
The weavers of Norwegian tapestries
usually work out from memory any pat
tern desired. The main body is of some
geometrical design, with a border of zig
zag lines or blocks. Certain character
istics of these rugs and tapestries remind
one of those made by the Navajo Indians.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 25, 1893.
HER DIAMOND
EARRINGS CAN
NOT BE FOUND
Julia Keeley's Prop
erty Missing.
THE POLICE INVESTIGATING
HER SISTER SATS THAT THE
BODY WAS ROBBED.
O'Shea, Her Slayer, Asks Permission
to Attend Her Funeral, Which
Request Was De
nied.
The police have been asked to inves
tigate the disappearance of a pair of
diamond earrings -which are supposed
to have been stolen from the body of
Julia Keeley, the unfortunate young
woman who was shot and killed by
Dan O'Shea, a steafnshlp fireman, last
Saturday night.
The sister of the dead woman is con
vinced that the Jewelry was stolen
from her ears while she lay in the cold
embrace of death. Yesterday she visited
Chief Lees and asked him to make a
thorough investigation with a view of
finding the culprit and Incidentally the
diamond earrings.
Shortly after the murder Police Offi
cer Owens took charge of the body. He
found a gold watch and chain with a
diamond locket attached, which be
longed to the dead woman, lying on the
bureau. He took charge of the jewelry
and subsequently turned it over to De
tective Tom Ryan. The latter gave it
to the Coroner, who has since returned
it to the sister of the murdered woman.
Several witnesses who saw the body
just after the fatal shot was fired posi
tively declare that they did not see any
diamonds in her ears. One of them
claims that he examined her head and
if she wore earrings he would have
noticed them. The sister of the de
ceased, however, is convinced that the
earrings were taken after the unfortu
nate woman was murdered. She claims
that she frequently saw the diamonds
in her ears and according to her own
admission she invariably wore them
after leaving the Baldwin Hotel, where
she was employed. The police Intend
to make a thorough investigation with
a view of finding out whether or not the
body was desecrated after the woman
was killed.
Yesterday O'Shea, who is charged
with the murder of the woman, asked
permission to attend her funeraj.
"I want to look upon her face before
she is buried," he tearfully remarked.
"I did not kill her; she knows I am in
nocent." His request was denied, much
to his disgust.
O'Shea still claims that he did not
shoot Miss . Keeley. His attorney is
preparing to make a desperate strug
gle to save his neck. The defense will
be that the fatal pistol was lying on a
table in the room, and as Miss Keeley
entered she tried to get possession of
it. O'Shea also endeavored to secure
the revolver and in the struggle that
followed the weapon was accidentally
discharged, the bullet striking her in
the head, causing instant death. The
prisoner denies that he wrote the tell
tale letters which were found in his
room. The police, however, claim they
have ample evidence to show that the
handwriting is the same as O'Shea's.

FITZGERALD'S
POLITICAL LIFE
IN THE BALANCE
Difficult to Fix His
Registration.
IS STILL ON TWO REGISTERS
GETS AN UNEXPECTED CERTIFI
CATE OF CHARACTER.
The "Hefting" Mayor's Candidate for
the .Important Office of Public
Administrator Still Under
Fire.
No person must cause him
self to be registered or en
rolled in one county when his
registration in another re
mains uncanceled. â Extract
from election laws.
Edward L. Fitzgerald, who was selected
by the "Hefting Boss," Mayor Phelan,
and by his Committee of One Hundred
purists as their candidate for the re
sponsible office of Public Administrator,
Is in dire distress.
His name is, contrary to law, hard and
fast upon the great registers of two coun
ties in this State. Notwithstanding des
perate efforts on his part to remove one of
them they will remain for some time to
come. He seeks the suffrage of the
voters of this city, so it is the telltale
records of Alameda County he would have
changed to relieve him from a possible
prosecution for violation of the State elec
tion laws.
Frank C. Jordan, County Clerk of Ala
meda County, dictated the following
statement yesterday:
Mr. Dam. representing: Mr. Edward Fitzger
ald called on me yesterday afternoon and
showed me a copy of a letter purport! n* to
have been written August 7, IS&6, requesting
me to cancel his registration in this county. I
at once made a very careful search of the rec
ords and failed to find any evidence of such let
ter or such cancellation. There is nothing of the
kind on record. I then went to the registra
tion file of Precinct 11, Berkeley, and lound
the required affidavit of registration.
There Is no evidence that the registration
was ever canceled or that thia office was aaked
to cancel It. Neither is theiv anything on the
great register against Mr. Fitzgerald a name
to indicate that such cancellation was asked
for or made Mr. Dam claimed that Mr. Fitz
gerald In answer to his letter received a cer
tificate of cancellation from this office In
August. 1596, and that he took It to San Fran
cisco, and was registered In one of the pre
cincts of San Francisco. This was when Mr.
Hinton was Registrar, and Mr. Dam nays that
It was lost or at least cannot be found.
1 have made a careful examination of all the
records of my office and there Is nothing what
ever to show that Mr. Fitzgerald changed his
registration.
The great register for this year Is now
closed, and Is In the hands of the printers, and
Mr Fitzgerald will appear as a registered
voter of Berkeley. I have no pewer to change
this.
Mr. Jordan's administration as County
Clerk has been a model one â compliment
ed by the business men of Oakland irre
spective of party affiliation. It is absurd
that Mr. Fitzgerald could have written to
Mr. Jordan and the latter canceled his
registration without some record being on
Ale.
Persons who have known Mr. Fitzgerald
for years were not surprised that hfe pro
duced the alleged copy of a letterâ he is
an adept at that game. That he can make
any one believe his word is anojLhe.r
matter.
Registrar Blggy of this city was asked
yesterday: "As Mr. Fitzgerald's name
does not appear legally on the San Fran
cisco Register, can he hold office here?"
The Registrar, who Is also a diplomat,
would nut discuss the matter. He was
content to say: "The case, which is a
serious one, has been called to my at
tention and I have commenced an investi-
gation."
The investigation has progressed to an
examination of all certificates of cancella
tion received by him and the one in ques
tion, the one alleged to have been pre
sented to him by Mr. Fitzgerald, Is not to
be found. The deputies in the office have
not had time to look over the old pre
cinct registration records, those of Mr.
Hinton's time, which are kept In tne
storeroom. Tne Registrar says he will do
h:s duty in the premises, no matter who
Is involved in the investigation. He will
send a deputy to Oakland to-day to confer
with Mr. Jordan, and the deputy will then
present the matter to him, Mr. Biggy,
officially. He has an able lawyer investi
gating the case from a legal standpoint.
The question was asked of the Regis
trar- "If you find that the name of E. L.
Fitzgerald is Illegally upon the great reg
ister of this city, what will be your action
in the premises?"
"I will follow the mandate of the law,
as I have done in many cases where I
have found that there has been illegal
registration," was his reply.
Clove Dam was at the County Clerk a
office, Oakland, all afternoon and as a
result of his search a poll list for Mr.
Fitzgerald's precinct in Berkeley was
found from which it does not appear that
Fitzgerald voted there in 1896. District
Attorney Snook advised that Dam be
given an affidavit that such was the case,
nnrf thi<s wis done. This is the step to
ward a technical clearing up of Mr. Fitz-
Kerald's double registration. It does not
remove the fact that his name appears on
two great registers, however.
Mr Fitzgerald sent a representative
to the city editor of The Call yes
terday, demanding a. retraction of cer
n.n statements made against him. He
awaited the return of the courier who
carried his ultimatum, in a nearby saloon.
The reply was not encouraging. It was to
the effect that the sooner he commenced
his action against the paper the better
pleased its representatives would be. The
rail would then be forced to expose his
part Tecord which will not bear the
Â£enrchintr light of publicity.
They are also positive he can tell what
nterarv services he rendered the Exam
iner during the Midwinter Fair and for
which he boasted he received $46 a week.
They scoff at the Idea that the "literary
work" consisted in carrying a valise full
of ballots, once voted for Alameda Coun
ty to the representative of Solano Coun
tv'who had a room at the Grand Hotel,
when not at his home In Adeline street.
The firm of Levl Strauss & Co. has
elven Mr Fitzgerald a certificate of good
character. They quote a paragraph from
The Call of October 22, and, although no
name Is mentioned, profess to believe the
paragraph alluded to their establishment.
They claim that a certain letter, lauda
tory of their factory, was a voluntary of
fering and was not paid for.
CHINESE CUT AND
SHOOT EACH OTHER
HIGHBINDER WAB OPENED AND
MORE TROUBLE EXPECTED.
Mock Too Shot by Chin Noon and Geo
Qui Die Stabbed by
Gow Sai.
The highbinder war which has been ex
nected by the police for some time broke
out last night when Mock Foo was shot
by Chin Noon at the Washington street
theater. The injured man was taken 10
the hospital, where his wounds vere
dressed by Dr. Zabala.
The shooting occurred In the second
gallery of the theater during a perform
ance given under the auspices of the Gee
Gong Tong, a society of Chinese Free
Masons. Sergeant McMannus was direct
ly across the street from the theater
when the shooting occured, and seeing
the Chinamen flock from the doors went
to make an investigation. Mock Foo
walked out of the theater and told the
officer that he had been shot in the back
by a man named Chin Noon. Further
than this he refused to make any state
ment. He was shot twice in the small
of- the back with a 44-caliber revolver, one
of the bullets passing entirely through
the body and the other lodging under
the skin in the abdomen, from where it
was removed by the hospital surgeon.
Mock Foo is a tailor, and while neither
he nor his friends will give any expla
nation as to the cause of the shooting, it
is believed by the police that this Is the
reopening of the old tailors' union trou
ble. Ever since the fishers began to ar
rive from the canneries in Alaska the
police have been on the lookout for trou
ble, and every suspicious Chinaman has
been held up and searched. A number
of them have been found with new re
volvers on their persons, and shooting
has been expected every night. The nf
fair of last night is only a starter and
more shooting will be no surprise to the
officers.
A quarrel between two Chinamen on
the ship Santa Clara, which reached port
yesterday, resulted in the stabbing of
Geo Qui'Die by Gow Sal. Neither man
will state the cause of the quarrel, though
the affair was reported to the police by
friends of the wounded man. Officer
Smith of the Harbor Station arrested
Gow Sai last evening, and Geo Qui Die
was taken to his home at 606 Washington
street. He is wounded in the left temple
and shoulder and twice in the stomach.
Both of the injured Chinamen are very
low and their recovery is doubtful.
FIGHTER LAVIGNE IS HERE.
The Clever Pugilist Will Doubtless
Sign To-Day to Fight Tom
Tracy.
"Kid" Lavigne has arrived from his
Eastern home In Saglnaw for the pur
pose of meeting Tom Tracy in a twenty
round contest under the auspices of the
National Club. The "Kid," according to
an engagement, was to have met the
managers of the National Club at 8
o'clock last evening, but for some reason
he failed to put in an appearance. In all
probability he will sign articles to-day
with Tom Tracy for the contest, which
will be held in the very near future.
It was rumored last evening that some
athletic club which is considered a rival
to the National was trying to persuade
Lavlgne not to fight under the auspices
of the National, but it can safely be
eald that the lad from Saginaw will not
be a party to any unprincipled proposi
tion which may mean the breaking up of
the sport in this city.
MRS. STERRETT'S SUIT.
Action to Recover Gustav Walter's
Estate Has Been Filed.
The long prepared suit of Mrs. Emma
Sterrett against Josephine Walter, admin
istratrix of the estate of Gustav Walter,
in which a decree is sought declaring and
Impressing a trust upon 12,500 shares of
the Walter Orpheum Company, $35,000 now
on deposit with the First National Bank,
$4000 on deposit with the Hibernia Bank
and five bonds of the Market-street Rail
way Company, was filed yesterday. In
the action Mrs. Sterrett alleges that the
property referred to was all accumulated
by Walter with moneys placed in his
hands by her to expend and invest as her
trustee and manager. Since Walter's
death Mrs. Sterrett has been dispossessed
by Mrs. Walter and now sues to recover
the property she claims.

HISTORY SHOULD HAVE
TAUGHT PHELAN A LESSON
Two Other Instances of "Hefting" in the Treasury
Department Whose Moral Was Not Heeded
by the Posing Boss.
With Defeat Staring Dim in the Face the "Holier Than Thou"
Mayor Cries for Aid While the Boodling Examiner
Pleads for a Corruption Fond.
James D. Phelan, the "hefting" Mayor,
cannot excuse his dereliction of duty
through Ignorance of the evils of such
practices, for the history of San Fran
cisco has two dark pages in it previous
to the Widber page, and thesa pages re
count crime, suicide and loss of money to
the city through similar methods.
When A. J. Bryant was Mayor a clerk
in the Treasurer's office abstracted money
.from the vaults, and his peculations
were permitted to go on through the re
missness of the Mayor, Auditor and
County Judge, who failed to count the
cash, but trusted to seeing the bags and
"hefting" them. After taking $20,000 the
deputy found that his crime was about
to be discovered and made a clean breast
of it and then killed himself.
Some years later, when James Otis was
Mayor, Alexander Austin. Tax Collector,
produced "certificates" from a depository
Instead of the coin, which the law says
must be "seen and counted." Judge
Btanly Insisted on "seeing and counting"
the coin, and for this was roundly de
nounced by friends of Mayor Otis and
Collector Austin. "When the bags were
opened it was found that there was a de
ficiency of $20,000. Austin's bondsmen
were compelled to make good the amount.
Pholan is undoubtedly familiar with the
facts in these cases, and knew that had
the law been complied with there could
have been but a small deficiency, which
would have been detected in the begin
ning. Had he properly "seen and count
ed" Widber's cash there would have been
no heavy defalcation, and the city would
not to-day be loser to the extent of more
than $16,000.
But this "Business Mayor" was too
busy laying wires for higher offices to
look after the duties for which he w;is
paid to perform, hence Widber's defalca
tion was permitted to grow from month
to month until it reached a point where
the erring Treasurer could no longer con
ceal it and exposure and ruin came.
While Phelan prates of his own hon
esty, and says there are none honest
. h to sit in council with him in
. Itber the Third, Fifth, Seventh. Ninth
and Tenth Wards, the people would like
to know what grade of honesty it is that
will permit a man to draw a big salary
to look after the city's interests and then
violate the plain letter and spirit of the
law.
Those men in the Third. Fifth, Seventh,
Ninth and Tenth Wards, whom Mayor
Phelan wished to supplant by "honest and
fit" men from other wards may not have '

Great Britain will expend the sum of
$2,875,000 on the Honkong dockyard exten

The Russian Imperial yacht Standart
1b the largest, fastest and most elegantly
furnished vessel belonging to royalty. She
was ordered as far back as 1893 by the
late Czar, who drove the first rivet of sil
ver in a plate of the same metal, now con
cealed under one of the toptank plates.
Originally the ship was intended for a
troopship, her cost to be nearly $1,250,000.
Three years later orders were received by
the contractors in Copenhagen. Denmark,
to convert the vessel into an Iperial yacht
plainly fitted out for which the sum of
$250.0<a> additional was to be allowed. But
during the following two years more
changes were ordered involving $150,000
additional cost and by the time she was
finally completed, one year ago, her total
cost had run up to $1,750,000. The Standart
is 370 feet in length, 50 feet C inches beam
and displaces 5247 tons. She carries a bat
tery of eight six-pounder Hotchkiss guns,
eight boats and four 40-feet steam
launches. The Imperial apartments are
on the main deck aft the engines, while
forward of the boiler room the officers of
the ship are quartered. The vessel is
lighted by electricity, over 1000 lamps be
ing distributed and nearly twenty miles
of wire is used. Her speed is 22 knots,
with 11,323 horse power.
The Pegasus, one of eight cruisers of
2135 tons building- by contract for the Brit
ish navy, has passed through a very satis
factory natural draught trial of eight
hours. The contract called for 1<?. 6 knots
with 5000 horse power, but she developed
20 knots and 5400 horse power. She is
fitted with water-tube boilers of the Reed
type and carried 278 pounds of steam, the
air pressure was .86 of an inch and the
revolutions averaged 203. Unfortunately
for a fair comparison with her aister
ships, the Pegasus was flying nearly two
feet light, and under the same conditions,
she will have no difficulty in reaching 21
knots when her forced draught trial
Cannes off. At the thirty hours coal con
sumption trial the engines developed 3693
horse power. Riving a Â«peed of 17.26 knots
and the coal consumption was only 1.96
pounds per horse power.
Tn the French armored cruiser Jeanus
d'Arc, the triple screw engines occupy
nearly three-quarters of the length of the
ship, although the length of. the vessel is
over 460 feet. A total horso power of
25.000 and a speed of 23 knots is expected.
Bhe will have six funnels, and electricity
will furnish the motive power for the
larger guns and for the ammunition
hoists.
Lockroy, Minister of the French Mar
ine, has great faith in the utility of the
submarine boats building at Brest, and
devotes much personal attention to the
subject of submarine warfare.
Japan has now an Institution of Naval
Architects, the new society just orga
nized beginning with 250 members and as
sociates. An Association of Engineers
has existed In Japan for nearly twenty
years.
The Emperor of China, acting upon the
euggestion of Yu Lee, the new member
of the Grand Council, has issued orders
to the North and South Superintendents
of Trade to advance $250,000 annually for
a term of ten years toward the building
of a new navy. Other viceroys have also
been ordered to subscribe, and the Im
perial Maritime Customs will forward the
requisite amount!.
A torpedo boat destroyer, built for the
German navy by Thorneyeroft at Ghis
wick, and known as D 10, had a measured
mile trial last month at the Mapiin. With
the official load of 84 tons aboard the boat
made a mean speed of 28.545 knots. The
contractors have guaranteed a speed of
27.5 knots on a trial to be ma4e in Ger
many with German engineers and firemen
in charge of trip machinery. The boat
Is 211 feet 9 inches In length, 19 feet 6
inches beam, displaces 300 tons on a
draught of 7 feet 6 Inches, and the horse
power Is 6500. The armament consists of
five 3-pounders and three torpedo tubes.
Nine years ago ten torpedo gun boats
of 735 tons were built for the British
navy. They were to have a speed of 21
knots with 4500 horse power under forced
draught and 15. 75 knots under natural
draught and 2800 horse power. The ro
I that kind of "honesty," but they have
I the honesty which will see to it that they
! are represented by men who will not
i slight their duty.
These men in the tabooed wards may
not be "fit" to work with a Mayor who
poses as the acme of morality and purity
In politics and then descends to political
tricks to gain his ends, but they are "fit
to pass judgment on him, and when Fne
lan is weighed in their balance he Is
found wanting.
The Mayoralty chair as a stepping-stone
to the United States Senate may be Phe
lan's idea, but the people prefer it to be
used for the good of the city, and when
the "hefting" Mayor tries to surround
himself with men who will do his bidding
and let him be in absolute control of city
affairs, those Democrats who have been
turned down as unftt feel that there taust
be some design in this sudden assumption
of honesty and fitness. They feel that
the Mayor's business methods, so far as
city affairs are concerned, are baa ana
they condemn him.
They condemn his dereliction of dut> ,
they condemn his assumption of ultra
purity; they condemn his snobbishness
in catering to the aristocratic element of
the city and saying that the men in al
most half of the city are not ht to asso
ciate with him; i.icy condemn him tor
swearing that but $250 was spent by and
for him during the last campaign, when
there is every evidence that thousands
of dollars were spent; they condemn him
for wearing a silk hat and kid gloves
when he goes among the aristocratic peo
ple and then showing his contempt for
wofkingmen by appearing before them in
old clothes and a slouch hat; they
condemn him for his arrogance in ap
pointing a committee to look after the
interests of the Democratic party and
refusing the rank and file of the party a
voice in the councils.
The "hefting" Mayor begins to feel this
ciimlemnation. for he has abandoned all
idea of election by his own party and
n.-w tries to wheedle Republican votes,
and his champions, the twin evils of jour
nalism, the Subsidized Bulletin and the
blackmailing Examiner, brazenly admit
this defection and proceed to read out of
the party all Democrats who have the
honrsty "and temerity to vote against
Phelan.
But while "hefting" Phelan poses and
his buzzard newspapers split hairs over
grave accusations, the people of the city
are turning from the man of pretense and
arrogance, and flocking to the standard
of Patton In such numbers that conster
nation sits in the Phelan camp and the
"hefting" Mayor is crying aloud to the
leaders of his' party for help, while the
boodling Examiner devotes its columns
to frantic appeals for a corruption fund
wherewith to buy the election.
suits, however, were very disappointing,
as the highest horse power reached was
only 3500 and a corresponding speed of 20
knots. But the trouble was not confined
to vie boilers alone, which were blamed
for the failure, for the hulls were found
to be dangerously flimsy and threatened
to fall apart at the high speed. It be
came necessary to put additional
strengthening into the hulls, thereby in
creasing the displacement from 735 to 770
tons, and the Admiralty waa satisfied
with natural draught power, which gave
a speed of about IS knots. In Brassey's
Annual these boats have ever since ap
peared as 30-knot racers and a uniform
horsepower of 3500. One of these boats,
the Salamander, underwent a three
hours' natural draught trial in Septem
ber last and with new boilers developed
272G horsepower and a speed of 17 knots,
which falls considerably short of the esti
mate when designed.
SCIENTIFIC JOTTINGS.
It is said that the cruelty and selfishness
I of Tiberius, the Roman Emperor, deprived
| the world of aluminum for eighteen cen
i turies. During his era, 41 B. C. to 37
I A. D., a worker in metals appeared at his
| court with a beautiful goblet, which
! shone like silver, and yet which, when
: purposely dropped on the floor by the arti
ficer, was bent out of shope. Quickly, be
j fore the court, he repaired it with his
j hammer. The Emperor asked as to the
material and was told the workman got
| it from a certain clay. The me-tal had the
â¢ same brilliancy as silver, was lighter and
j more ductile. The Emperor asked if any
one else knew tho secret of the manufac
ture and waa proudly told no by the
, clever workman. Thereupon. Tiberius,
i realizing that the value of ooth gold and
i silver would be greatly decreased if the
; new metal became popular, seized the
i workshop of the man, destroyed the con
\ tents and decapitated the unfortunate in
j ventor himself. There is no doubt the
j metal was the aluminum of to-day.
I The fact that tin, of all metals in com
j mon use, is only sparingly distributed
i throughout the world is again called at
â  tention to by an Australian geologist, Mr.
| B. J. Skertehley, who has published a
| monograph upon the subject. While the
I known gold fields of the world cover more
'â  than 1.500,000 square miles, the tin fields
j have an area of less than 12,500 squares
I miles. Thus, for every square mile of tin
; ground, there are 132 squares miles of
gold-bearing country. There are seven tin
1 districts in Europe, producing about 8300.
tons yearly, or which the Cornish
! mines yield about 800 tons. Asia
! has two tin areas â Hunan In China,
i estimated by some of the best au
! thorities to produce 10,000 to 20,000 tons
I a year, but proved by official figures to
! yield less than 2500 tons, and the Straits
I Settlements and adjacent principalities,
yielding 58,000 tons yearlyâ the richest
i yield in the world. Africa has no known
I tin mine; South America, only one tin
! area, Bolivia and Peru yielding less than
| 4000 tons a year, and Australasia, the
youngest, contributes about 6000 tons a
: year.
JOHN ALLEN'S TRUE STORY.
It ie a debatable question among his
friends whether John Allen depends more
upon memory or invention for his inex
haustible fund of stories. Colonel Wil
liam R. Morrison, who is somethmg of a
story teller himself, once felt called upon
to explain Mr. Allen's staying powers,
after a bout in which he and the Missls
sippian htul alternated in entertaining a
party of railroad men while the Interstate
Commerce Commission was having a slt
i ting at Tupelo.
"I can't compete with John Allen," said
Colonel Morrison, apologetically, "because
i I haven't got the gift of imagination. M>
storlee are true. They are actual occur
rences. Everybody in Washington knows
that John Allen's stories are made up as
he goes along. Now, I once heard him
tell of an army experience that was pure
fiction on its race. He said that a com
â â  rade and he were lying behind a log while
j the battle was going on in front of them.
The fighting was pretty hot. Allen and
I his comrade were a good deal in doubt
as to how long that log would protect
them from the bullets. They got into a
discussion as to which should poke up his
head and take a view of the surround
ings. Finally, Allen says, his comrade
urged: "John, you look and see where
the Yankees are. You know you are a
i single man and haven't got any family.'
| Now," concluded Colonel Morrison, "that
was something that never happened, but
I have heard Allen tell it repeatedly, and
always raise a laugh."
There was a general smile at John Al
len's expense, and then Edward L Rus
sell, the president of the Mobile and Ohio
Railroad said: "Colonel, you are mis
taken. That was a true story. I was the
other fellow behind that log."â Bt. Louis

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 25, 1898.
LEFT HER
COMPANY IN
THE LURCH
Clara Thropp Leaves
Town Suddenly.
HER WHEREABOUTS A SECRET
MISS SWIFT MOURNS A SUIT OF
UNDERCLOTHING.
Manager Leavitt Will Take Out
Requisition Papers and Have
the Actress Brought Back
to Town.
Without a word of warning either to her
company or her manager Clara Thropp
quietly slipped out of town yesterday af
ternoon, leaving her business and profes
sional associates to face the unpleasant
task of accounting for her absence to an
audience that comfortably filled the New
Comedy Theater last evening.
ilisa Thropp, who Is advertised as a
soubrette, was billed to appear yesterday
night In a medley of mirfn and melody
entitled "The Little Hussar." Shortly af
ter 6 o'clock Manager Leavltt of the Com
edy received a message from his "star**
stating that she was indisposed and would
not be able to appear in the evening's
performance. Miss Thropp's reported in
disposition aroused the manager's and the
company's suspicions, and at once Charlie
Thropp, the "Hussar's" brother and rep
resentative, was started on a chase for
the recalcitrant soubrette, with orders to
bring her back to face her audience and
her duties.
Brother Charlie's quest was useless.
Miss Thropp was nowhere to be found. At
the hotel where she had made her head
quarters it was learned that she hud
transferred her trunks to climes and hos
telry unknown and that she had neglected
the small duty of- paying her board bill.
A search of her theater trunks revealed
the fact that they were empty, an Inci
dent that went a long way to explain the
daily package that Miss Thropp carried
away from the theater with her. In her
Installment packings the suubrette had
bundled away elaborate stage gowns sne
had borrowed from Miss Goodwin, one of
the ladies of her company, as well as
one suit of Jaeger's, which the actress
had also taken from the same prolific
source.
While Manager Leavitt was having the
city searched for the absent actress word
was brought him that the winsome Clara,
with a friend, two hand satchels and a
ticket for the Oregon express had been
seen crossing the ferry at 5 o'clock. The
news completely prostrated the company,
to which Miss Throp-> is heavily indebted.
The charming and clever Clara is also be
holden to Manager Leavitt for nearly
$750.
PrevlouÃ to leaving town Miss Thropp
gave out the story that Manager Leavitt
was indebted to her for more than $lwo.
Miss Thropp explained the delinquency by
suiting that Manager Leavitt, who was
playing her on a 50 per cent busi
ness profit basis, had neglected to forward
her the transportation for herself and
company from Ogden to this city. In an
swer to Miss Thropp's wire for railroad
fares Leavitt is said to have advised that
the percenatge due him be used for that
purpose. According to tne Thropp story
there was no profit coming to the man
agement, and the actress was forced to
put up for the transportation. This al
leged breach of trust is said to have been
Miss Thropp's especial grievance, and, ac
cording to her friends, explains her un
expected leave-tuking unaccompanied by
the formality of leaving her address
Manager Leavitt tells quite a diifferent
story and backa his assertion by state
ments and a long list of figures.
"Besides the shameful way In which
Miss Thropp has treated her company,
leaving them with many weeks' salary
due, I have the added grievance of being
out over $750. I played Miss Thropp and
company from St. Joseph out here and
was to have received 50 per cent of the
gross receipts. As business was poor, I
allowed Miss Thropp to collect and use
my percentage, and she owes me my
share from the first town out till here.
When she got to Salt Lake she wired me
for transportation and I forwarded her
$160. Instead of using the money as I in
tended she should, Miss Thropp hypothe
cated her trunks out here for $250, and so
that she might open here as adverttÃed I
had to redeem those trunks from the
Southern Pacific." Mr. Leavitt has de
cided to take out requisition papers and
make Miss Thropp come back and face
the music. . . .
Charles Thropp, brother of the missing
actress, professes to know nothing of her
whereabouts. "I lunched with my sister
yesterday noon," he said, "and that is the
last I saw of her. At that time she was
extremely nervous and excited and ex
pressed her fear of facing a San Francis
co audience in a new play of uncertain
merit She said that to reduce expenses
she had given up her apartments at the
Lang-ham and had gone to stay with a
friend, Mre. Parson Taylor. I feel con
fident that she has not left town, that she
is just unstrung and nervous and will
turn up in time for to-morrow evening's
performance."
Mr Thropp does not know where his
sister's friend Mrs. Taylor can be found,
but is confident his slater is safely rest
ing with her.
Instead of "The Little Hussar
"Where's Matilda" went on at the thea
ter last evening. Miss Marie Wlnsom
assuming with success Miss Thropp's
part. ________^_â
THE ENGLISH BARMAID.
"If the Hoboken barmaids, about whom
there is much discussion just now, were
treated as the average English barmaid
and waitress is treated they would resign
in disgust," said a man who has just re
turned from London. "Before I left Eng
land an investigation was being made by
one of the morning papers of tha regu
lations under which these women work
and the results were surprising. The con
ditions of work there are trying and un
healthy. Owing to the reluctance oi em
ployes to give evidence against their em
ployers it was difficult to get at the truth,
but enough has been discovered to war
rant a sweeping Investigation. For ex
ample, It was found to be a common prac
tice for the employer to shut out a wait
ress or barmaid from Saturday night to
Sunday night, leaving her to lodge where
she could. And this practice of the em
ployers to shut the waitresses In on Sun-
Say between the time of closing and open
ing is to make sure that they secure the
proper rest. Aa to the wages paid, any
one who has tried to secure employment
for a respectable girl, entirely dependent
on the money she can earn, will find that
the best remuneration is totally insuffi
cient to keep her without additional help.
The young woman who Is willing to work
all day for a pittance which is some con
tribution to a common family fund fixes
the standard of wages at a starvation
point for the worker who is dependent on
her work.
"The hours of work for barmaids are
long and late. The Kemp bill, which has
just been drawn, fixes the limit of work
ing hours for these women at ten a day.
and forbids more than five hours at a
stretch without an Interval of at least
half an hour for a meal. It remains to be
seen how this will be enforced. Women In
America who have to work for a living
have no occasion to envy the women
workers in England."
A REMARKABLE CASE.
A thirteen-year-old girl of thl3 county
was brought to the city Tuesday to have
p.n examination made of her eyes. She
was taken to Dr. Pricer's office on
Third street, and. after a thorough exam
ination, the doctor found that the optic
nerve was dried and shriveled and almost
dead from the excessive use of tobacco.
The doctor found, upon questioning the
girl, that she had used tobacco since she
was 4 years old. She said that she had
a good smoke just before leaving home.
The girl ie almost totally blind, she is not
able to distinguish objects that axe dis
tant one foot from her eyes. The case
is remarkable on account of the child's
age. A case of this kind can be treated
successfully If the patient quits the use
of tobacco.â lronton Republican.

The list of nominations to the first ten
stakes of the California Jockey Club, to
be decided at Oakland track, was issued
yesterday. There is a noticeable lack of
Eastern horses among the list, but if the
money stays at home there can be no
"kicking" on that score.
These stakes and entries will later be
issued in book form and public interest
will revert to the opening handicap to be
decided on the first day of the meeting.
Saturday, October 29. The entries and
weights are as follows:

HANDLING COAL IN LONDON.
Infinite as 1b the variety of the ship
ping that finds its way to the Thames,
there is due to arrive in the river to
day a craft whose unusual appearance
will excite the curiosity of the long
shore population.
Recently there left the Tyne, in
charge of three powerful tugboats, a
larjre steel structure known in ship
builders 1 parlance as a derrick pontoon,
which, Riven a good voyage, will haul
up to Its berth at the coal depots of
William Cory & Son, Limited, at Charl
ton. This derrick pontoon, which has
been christened Atlas No ; 3, is specially
intended to facilitate the discharge and
distribution of the seaborne coals.
The pontoon measures 500 feet in
length by 47 feet 6 inches in width and
12 feet 6 inches in depth, and her outfit
of machinery is of such an Ingenious
and powerful character that she can
claim to be the only craft of her kind
in the world. Atlas No. 3 has, indeed,
been specially designed to carry out a
specific purpose, and when she is safely
moored at her berth Londoners will be
able to see their coal handled at a rate
which cannot be equaled at any other
coal-importing center.
At Charlton there are now two float
ing derricks, but they are simply old
ships converted for the purpose. The
new derrick pontoon is shi^shaped at
the ends, with a poop at each end, and
has four lines of rails running nearly
Its entire length. On one side â the side
which will present itself to the river, at
â which the steam colliers are to lie â
there are nine hydraulic grabs, with
weighing machines attached, running
on one pair of rails. With these grabs,
when a collier arrives alongside, the
coal will be hurried out of the holds,
weighed, and registered, and then
swung round and discharged into nine
corresponding chutes traveling on an
other pair of rails, and from the chutes
the coals are shot out on the opposite
side of the pontoon into barges.
In the course of a day it is estimated
that this derrick pontoon will be able to
handle in this way about 5000 tons of
coal, or the cargoes of four to five ordi
nary steam colliers.
Nor does this exhaust the equipment
of London's new coal distributor. There
is a complete set of workshops on
board, co that repairs can be done by
the staff; a large kitchen, with range
and grill, and separate dining rooms for
the lightermen, private cabins for the
captain and engineer in charge, and a
handsomely fitted directors' room,
while the electric light Is fitted
throughout.
The Cory Company imports and dis
patches over London and its environ
ments between five and six million toes
of sea-borne coal per year. This vast
quantity is used almost entirely for
household, manufacturing and bunker
ing purposes, and leaves out of account
another two or three million tons im
ported by the great gas companies for
lighting purposes, and also the large
quantity of rail-borne house coal that
comes Into the metropolis from the
Yorkshire and Midland coal fields.â

NOW A BEGGAR IN NEW OR
LEANS.
"A few nights ago," said a visitor
from New York, "I was standing on
the steps of my hotel, when a shabby
fellow with a frightful cough sidled up
and began the regulation hard luck
story. His distress was so evident that
I gave him a quarter at once, but when
I took a second look at his face I was
startled to recognize a musician who
had formerly been leader of the orches
tra of one of the principal theaters of
New York, and who was supposed in
those days to have a remarkably prom
ising career before him. He had com
posed several things that caught the
popular ear, and to all appearances
was a coming man. Then of a sudden,
and for no apparent reason, he lost his
grip, as the saying goes, and disap
peared. Perhaps there was a romance
at the bottom of it, and perhaps there
was something else. Anyhow, he
dropped out of sight, and now, after
half a dozen years or so, I find him
begging in the streets of New Orleans.
Queer, isn't it? He did not look as
if he had dissipated to any extent, and
all I could get out of him was that he
had been sick. When he saw I recog
nized him he hurried away at once. He
was a sensitive, high strung fellow in
the old times, and it is pitiful to think
what he must have passed through on
his way to the gutter." â New Orleans
Times-Demorrat.
In a new feed water regulator a float
is placed on the surface of the water, and
connected with a rod running to a slid
ing plate on the outside, which slides
across a fixed plate to form an electrical
connection as long as the water is low,
the current operating a magnet, which
opens or closes the valve in the feed
water pipe.
Gas is automatically shut off when
blown out by a new attachment, consist
ing of a balanced arm with an umbrel'a
shaped hood, which is held above the
burner by tho heat of tha flame, and \e
scends as soon aa the flame is extinguish
ed, thus pulling a lever, which cuta off
the gas.

The following letter has been received
by The Call:
October 24, IS9B.
To the Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir:
W 111 you kindly permit me to use the
columns of The Hall to make a few com
menta upon a communication published
in the issue of the 23d lnst. relative to the
work undertaken by the Society for the
Suppression of Vice, namely the closing of
the immoral resorts on Bacon place. The
writer of the article protests against the
influx of dissolute women into the North
Beach district and argues that it will
have a blighting effect upon the children,
who are very numerous in that section or
the city and would have to gaze upon
the disgusting spectacle. We are in ac
cord with this view and are pleased that
he Is striving to prevent such a degrad
ing state of affairs, and will render him
every assistance in our power to destroy
the pest. He declares that ho has called
upon the Chief of Police to assist him,
but that dignitary has helped him by an
"oyster dumbness" and a "masterly Inac
tivity;" in other words the chief has ig
nored him, and he asks the public, par
ticularly parents, "to judge of his con
duct and to say whether the morals of
our youth are safe In his keeping." In
our opinion they are not. We think the
writer has reason to complain and we
sympathize with him and urge him to op
'iy every lawful means In his power
the direful effect of the Chief's inactivity.
He argues that the premises surround
ing Pine, California and Dupont streets
have been "ruined irreparably" by this
immoral traffic. We acknowledge the
fact and press it further. A thing irre
purably ruined has no longer reason to
exist. That has been our contention
from the beginning, and hence our efforts
to supplant the "irreparable ruin" with a
breathing- spot for the people in the form
of a park. "In the area inhabited by
these fallen women the birth of a child is
SfiiK'thing unheard of." Why? Because
These characters are there. If they were
nut there this section would undoubtedly
compare favorably in this respect even
with North Beach. A good reason for
their removal.
The writer declares that It is his belief
that the evil complained oT should be "im
led and compressed." Is he reported
tly? Localize evil! Did God ever
teach us to localize a crime? Did he con
tent himself with localizing the lechery
of Sodom and Gomorrha? Did he not
hurl against it the power of his wrath?
lÂ»id he not cauterize the very ground on
which the cities were built with fire and
brimstone? Did Christ try to localize a
kindred traffic in the temple? Did he say
to the money-changers go here or thereâ
behind this pillar or that door? Did he
hesitate lest the miscreants, being driven
out, would occupy some other temple?
No. AMaze with a holy wrath he seized a
scourge and lushed them from his sight
go where they might â settle where they
wouldâ if others let them in theirs wouid
8 judgment. Was this "loving your
neighbor as yourself?" Did he act to
ward them with "charity, mercy and
equity?" Does the State act with Justice
or charity when it prohibits the crime, aa
It has done?
It is well contended that a fire is not
extinguished by spreading it industriously
through the town. We agree to that. Let
the fire company be called and stamp it
out, and if perchance in their efforts a
stray spark be carried on the breeze to
other buildings, let our neighbors arouse
themselves and quench the spark. No one
who is not terribly deceived will Pay that
Immorality is a necessary evil. Weak as
human nature is we believe better things
of it than thatâ God is not God if sin is
essential.
What would the writer have us do? Does
he .-xpeot us to tolerate the .abiding
stench of the leprosy that has crowded
to our very door? Because it has existed
there for Borne time does not give it a
right to remain there. He may remove his
residence or endure it, if he bo pleases,
but as long as the law is on our side we
ehall oppose this moral pestilence.
The regret has been expressed that
there is no law to reach and punish the
masculine lepers who make this traffic
possible. 1 uere is a law, but our Police
Board laugh at it. An efficient Police De
partment could solve this whole prob
lem in a week. If our Police Department
were watchful, active and aggressive the
evil would not exist. Brooklyn to-day Is
perhaps the* cleanest city in the Union,
yet ten years ago had you stood by its
City Hall thirty-eight haunts of shame
could be counted within a radius of 300
How was that city's expurgation
accomplished? Public indignation was
aroused. An honest and efficient Police
:!inent was secured; its Chief was
fearless in the discharge of his duty.
Every week the captains reported their
respective precincts. It was publicly
Ftated that there were captains there in
power who were receiving a percentage
on every bottle of wine sold In these sham
bles of sinâ a revenue from all the cribs
of death. These captains protested, pro
tested loudly and madly and long. They
the W'.rk could not be done. A po
liceman's badge debarred him from ad
mittance to these h.'ll-holes. They would
not let him see the crime, therefore he
was helpless. The Chief announced "break
In the doors." other captains said, "The
vice is of too long standing; we cannot
crush it," and the police Chief answered:
".Send in your badges and your resigna
tions. I can fimi other men who can."
If a citizen pointed to a single case the
law had overlooked. Police Chief Camp-
Veil rallied a handful of his men around
him and swept down upon it like a whirl
wind, and so Brooklyn stands to-day in
point of morals foremost among the
cities of the world.
If we had a Chief who desired to sub
firess this evil how long could it last?
low long could iniquity defy him? If we
can arouse the law-loving citizens of this
city to action we can free ourselves from
the thralldom in which we are held. At
the door of the Chief of Police we lay the
blameâ for the law forbids the use of
ir thin immoral traffic. The
â writer in the article counsels impounding
and compressing. In spite of divine and
State law he may do so, but we shall
make no truce or compromise with crime!
Th.^ suggestion in an evening paper for a
conference Is absurd until the law Is
chang-fil. Come what may we see our
duty stretched before us, plain and un
mistakable, and we feel that God 1h with
us in thf- strife and so we shall fight this
vice with all th<* Intensity of our being â
light if needs be single-handed and alone
â fight until our hands fall lifeless by our
I :nri others more worthy and more
capable than we rise up to take our
placets. Yours gratefully,

J. A. LEONARD RETURNS.
Is Recovering From an Injury Re
ceived on His Way Up the
Yukon.
Joseph A. Leonard, who went from here
last June as manager of an expedition
to dredge for gold on the Yukon River,
arrived yesterday on the steamer Walla
Walla.
While on the way up the Yukon River
a month ago his foot slipped and caught
in the machinery of the boat and was
badly crushed and mangled. From lack
of surgical care and proper medicines
blood poisoning and erysipelas Bet in, and
hope of saving his life was given up by
the other members of his party. At his
urgent request he was sent back down
the river, accompanied by J. C. Hum
phreys, a dentist of Alameda. After en
during many hardships they made St.
Michael. Mr. Leonard's condition re
mained extremely critical until after
leaving St. Michael, when a supply of
medicines, obtained from a doctor on
the steamer they had taken passage on,
proved so beneficial that he soon Degan
to improve.
Mr. Leonard hopes to be able to save
his foot, and expects next summer to
rejoin his party, who believe him to by
this time dead. His vessel is the Dawson
City, which sailed from Ban Francisco
on the 23d of last June with twenty pas
sengers and apparatus for dredging gold
from the river beds by means of a cen
trifugal pump.
Mr. Leonard was carried from the
Bteamer on a mattress and was taken to
his home in Alameda.
A BOOM IS ON
THE WHEAT MARKET
WAR SCARES ARE GIVING FOR
EIGNERS UNEASINESS.
General Advance in Prices Here and
Among the European .
Traders.
A general bull wheat market Is upon
the country. There Is no Lelter. Supply
and demand rule the market. War scares
are giving foreigners no little uneasi
ness. December wheat In the Chicago
market advanced 3 cents yesterday.
Liverpool quoted wheat 6 cents advance
over Saturday's closing prices and a still
greater advance on the curb after the
regular trading. Consols declined 1 point,
the greatest decline in months. French
rentes opened at lOlf 90c and closed at
lOlf 65c, with late sales at l<nf.
Reports from the United Kingdom and
Continent were of the most exciting char
actor. Liverpool cabled that all sellers of
wheat had withdrawn their offers and all
kinds of prices were being paid. The out
look would indicate matters growing
worse before getting better. The trade
in general is disposed to look upon war as
being Impossible, but while conditions re
main threatening there is no telling where
prices for food products may go.
America Is about the only source of
wheat and corn supplies from which Eng
land and France may draw at the pres
ent time. The Continent was a good buyer
of wheat futures during the latter part of
yesterday's session, giving the market re
markable strength.
If conditions become more alarming
wheat will advance rapidly. The last
French complications sent prices far be
yond $1 25 per bushel. It is just dawning
upon the trade that wheat has been too
cheap. It Is more than likely America
will feed the world this year with her big
crop, which means renewed prosperity
and less likelihood of prices going back
to their former low level.
The advance in cereals during October
means over $100,000,000 to producers-^-a
sung sum. "Wheat has influenced corn
prices, the latter advancing about 4 centa
per bushel. Hog products are strengthen
ing and promise a good-sized advance in
the near future. Cotton declined 10 points
on war rumors.
The local wheat market was strong, De
cember selling at $1 27Vi, May $129. Con
siderable celling by those who had good
profits in sight took place. There is a
etrong undertone to the market and much
depends upon Liverpool quotations. Yes
terday's trading was the largest since the
late decline. Barley was dull and neg
lected, traders awaiting developments.
TEACHERS MAY HELP
THE SCHOOL BOARD
CAN SIGN A PAPER TO FOREGO
SALARIES.
Only Way, According to Superintend
ent Webster, to Avoid a
Shortage.
The financial difficulties of the School
Board will not lead to the closing of the
public schools in December, as stated In
an ill advised rumor circulated yesterday.
Superintendent Webster said to a Call
| reporter: "There Is no reason to think
i that the schools will be compelled to shut
| down, even for a part of a month. This
I cry about the necessity of closing the
; schools is heard reguarly every year
; when the funds run low. So far as I can
i see the School Board cannot stop the
pay of the teachers, nor can it reduce
their pay 10 per cent, as the year's sala
: rles were fixed last July. If an attempt
should be made to cut the salaries I be
> lleve that the teachers would take action
in the courts. Nor can the board reduce
'. the number of teachers on the payroll, ac
j cording to decisions of the courts. Once
I a teacher is upon the payroll he or she
j must remain there, unless charges can
| be brought which will result in dismissal.
"There is but one way in which the
i School Board can be helped out of its
difficulties ;>y the teachers, and that is
by securing thflr voluntary signatures
to an agreement to release the board
from liability for their salaries for a
period of two weeks or a month. Perhaps
the teachers would be willing to make
I such a written agreement in case of a
' shortage. Any other way of handling the
'â  matter will, in my opinion, be subject to
I legal dispute."
"Are there not too many substitute
teachers?" waa askfri.
"Perhaps. I think that the schools
I could get along with fewer. ~"There are
I thirty-six paid substitutes in the day and
! night schools, drawing salaries aggregat
', ing $16,000 a year. As against this expen
i diture the School Board saved last year
i from the salaries of the regular teachers
: absent from their schools the sum of
i $7300, bo that the net loss by .the employ
| ment of the substitutes waa about $9000."
Asks for an Accounting.
Oscar Newhouse has sued E. A. Wiltsee,
his mining partner, for an accounting.
The plaintiff alleges that in June of 189 C
he entered into a copartnership with the
defendant, whereby it was agreed that
they should engage in the mining busi
ness. Since that time, the plaintiff al
leges, the profits have exceeded $50,000,
which the defendant has applied to his
own use to the exclusion of the plaintiff.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 25, 1898.
PHILANTHROPIC
SWIFT AND HIS
LUMBER BID
It Is Far Below the
Cost of Boards.
IS AWARDED THE CONTRACT
APPORTIONING THE VARIOUS
CITY FUNDS.
No Reason Given "by the Finance
Committee for the Long Delay
in the Segregation of
the Money,
The Board of Supervisors met yesterday
and passed the resolution segregating the
funds of the various departments, mak
ing no changes In the schedule previously
announced. No reason was offered by the
Finance Committee for Its long delay In
presenting the resolution, although it was
ready In the form adopted fully a month
ago. On several recent occasions there
have been discordant notes utttered by
several members of the "harmonious ma
jority," and resolutions have been pre
sented and withdrawn In a most Inex
plicable manner. That a falling out has
taken place among the brotherhood la be
lieved by many who arÂ© close observers.
The delay In segregating the funds for a
full month and then the final failure to
do anything except to pass the original
resolution causes this report of a dis
agreement to assume tangible grounda.
The board granted a contract for one
year to P. Swift to supply first-grade Ore
gon pine lumber to the Street Department
at $11 75 per 1000 feet. Mr. Swift sent word
to the Supervisors that he was not the P.
Swift who Is under Investigation by the
Grand Jury, but only his son. Inci
dentally It may be remarked that the
price of the first grade of Oregon pine In
carload lots, delivered In San Francisco,
ta $15 per 1000 feet, according to the state
ments of several reputable lumber dealers.
Mr. Swift, contractor, will, according to
these figures, be placed In the attitude of
a public benefactor, donating to the city
not only his reasonable profits, but also
$3 25 on each 1000 feet which he is per
mitted to deliver. The next lowest bidder
to Swift asked $18 per 1000 for his Oreg^ji
pine, but the Board of Supervisors did not
even consider his proposition, as it in
volved a profit of $3 per 1000 feet on the
face of it.
The Supervisors voted unanimously to
return to the various architects the plans
which had been presented for the con
struction of a new City and County Hos
pital. The board did not see fit to add
apology, stating that It had foolishly put
the architects to great expense of time
and trouble, which could have been avoid
ed If the board had before advertising for
plans asked the City and County Attor
ney if the procedure were legal.
Supervisor Smith, In behalf of Father
Otis, presented a petition asking for the
dosing of the disreputable dens on Bacon
place. It was promptly referred to the
Health and Police Committee until after
election;
Electric lamps were ordered placed at
Fell and Devlsadero, Fell and Broderick,
Twenty-flret and Guerrero, Hoffman and
Alvarado, View avenue and Twenty-third,
Douglass and Twenty-first; Tremont, near
Frederick; Liberty, between Castro and

ANARCHIST IMMIGRANT
TO BE EXCLUDED
ARRIVAL OF A FRENCH WOMAN
WITH A HISTORY.
She Was Exiled From France for
Holding Dangerous Doctrines
and Will Be Deported
Among the passengers arriving on the
Walla Walla yesterday was an old
French woman named Bertha de Giraud
d'Agay. Deputy Immigration Commis
sioner Geffeney questioned her and
found that she was a pauper and h.'id
been assisted to this country by a priest
in British Columbia. The woman made
an affidavit, of which the following Is the
text:
I am a native of France, aged 67 yeara. I
came from Vancouver, li. C. , where I have re
sided for two years pact. I was agÂ»nt for W.
Watson & Ives, opticians, London, for one
year, with two sons of mine. After that time
I became poor and lived for six months by sell
ing my goods and jewelry. For the past six
months I have been supported by Rev. P. Dom
meau, a Catholic priest at Vancouver, B. C.
He sent me to this city by the steamer Walla
Walla, which arrived here this morning. He
paid my passage and gave me $14 cash, of
which I have $4 left. I have real estate in
France (Langrune Sur Mer, province of Cal
vados, near Havre), valued at 25,000 francs,
fpim whu'h I receive COO francs each year. If
the resident French Consul will guarantee for
me I can get mmey from the French Bank in
this city now. I have no parents nor relatives
in this city. I desire to get assistance from
the French Society In San Francisco to send
me to France. Myself and s'une four were ex
pelled from France as suspected anarchists. I
am a Royalist. I want to go to England. The
above happened on the Hth of July, 1832.
BERTHA DE GIRAUD D'AGAT.
Mr. Geffeney called on the French Con
sul and on the president and cashier of
the French Bank, and found that they did
not know the woman and had no desire
to make her acquaintance. The Consul
said there is a French Consul at the
port from which the woman had been
shipped and he was the proper person to
have looked after the woman.
The Immigration Commissioner will
send her back to Victoria.
HIS WORK APPRECIATED.
Art Association Will Tender a Re-
ception to T. Alexander Har
rison.
The San Francisco Art Association will
tender a reception to T. Alexander Har
rison at the Mark Hopkins Institute of
Art on Friday evening: of this week.
Mr. Harrison is an artist of whom the
association is justly proud. He has trav
eled extensively, and wherever any of his
work has been placed on exhibition It has
received universal admiration. In this
city he has had an unusual honor con
ferred on him. It Is the custom of the as
sociation to give a medal every year to
the student doing: the best work, it being
stipulated, however, that the artist spend
a year in the institute. Mr. Harrison has
been there but eight months, but the
quality of his work was bo high that a
special ruling: was made in his favor and
he received the coveted medal.

Bold Crime of Three
Men.
WORKED AN OLD GAME
THE ARCH CO NSPIRATOji ELUDES
THE POLICE.
His Companions Landed in Prison
and Booked on Charges
of Grand Lar
ceny.
Two clever confidence men are locked
up in the City Prloon. Their names are
Joseph Beaumont and John Demarla.
They were arrested last night by De
tectives Oibson and Wren and Polloe
Officers Maloney and Daggett, and booked
on two charges of grand larceny.
Some tlmo ago the arch conspirator,
who has not yet been arrested, visited M.
Gagne, a florist at 1684 Pacific street, and
by representing that he was a wealthy
Italian soon won his confidence. He
claimed that he was possessed of con
siderable money, and offered to buy him
out. The following day Beaumont and
Demarla appeared and anxiously Inquired
about their "rich friend" who had recent
ly arrived from Italy. A few minutes
later the arch conspirator put In an ap
pearance and renewed his offer to buy
out Oagme. He carried In his hand a tin
box containing, so he claimed, $2000 in
gold. Passing it to the unsuspecting vic
tim the bold schemer told him to take
charge of it until he returned. Just then
one of his pals asked Gagne how much he
would take for his business. Thinking
that the time for him to sell out had ar
rived, Gagne offered to sell the place for
$1200.
The offer was quickly accepted, but as
the chief conspirator was not ready to
take possession he suggested that Gjyme
place the amount he wanted for the nur
sery In the box as a "guarantee of good
faith." As he claimed that he had de
posited $2000 in the box and as he offered
to allow Gagne to retain possession of it,
the latter, not suspecting anything wrong,
lost no time in going to his home and se
curing the amount required of him.
He then deposited it in the receptacle
along with the money of the confidence
man. Beaumont then took the victim
to one side and asked him if he did not
intend to reimburse him for his trouble
in effecting the sale. Gagne told him he
would give him $20, and as he started for
home to get it the clever schemer ab
stracted his money from the box. On
his return he was given the box and told
to keep it until the next day, when the
sale would be consummated.
As the prospective buyer did not ap
pear, Gagne became suspicious and
opened the box. To his surprise he found
that it contained a quantity of waste pa
per and a piece of lead pipe. He at once
reported his loss to Chief Lees, who de
tailed Detectives Gibson and Wren to ar-
rest the thieves.
While they were searching for them
they learned that they had robbed John
Garrigues, a hotel keeper at 814 Jackson
street, out of $800 by a similar trick.
One of them represented that he was anx
ious to buy the hotel, and induced the
proprietor to place $800 In a tin box, which
was "filled with gold" just to show that
he "meant business." While Garrigrues*
attention was temporarily distracted the
thieves opened the box and purloined his
money.
It was then securely locked and handed
to Garrigues, who placed it In his Bate.
The men promised to show up on the
following day, but as they did not ap
pear he became suspicious and forced
open the box. Like their former victim
Garrigues found that the box was filled
with lead pipe and scraps of paper.
From a description given of the men
the detectives, with the assistance at
Policemen Maloney and Daggett, arrested
two of the men and formally charged
them at the City Prison.
The chief conspirator is still at liberty,
but the police are hopeful of catching
him.
SOLDIERS TO BE DISCHARGED.
The Undesirable Men of the Tennes-
see Regiment Will Be
Mustered Out.
Orders were issued from department
headquarters yesterday afternoon for the
discharge of 160 men of the Tennessee
Regiment, who were found not suitable
for the service by Major Field, who in
spected them. Another general order was
also issued for the discharge of a number
of men from the Washington, Kansas and

ments and 164 from the Tennessee Regi-
ment.

of First Lieutenant Cady, the regimental
quartermaster of the lowa Regiment.
Both the lieutenant and Colonel Loper
stated yesterday that the account of the
Alleged shortage, as published In the
Chronicle, was Incorrect. Lieutenant
Cady said he knew nothing of the matter
until his attention was called to the ar
ticle in the paper. Inquiry at division
headquarters showed that instead of being
short Lieutenant Cady had submitted his
returns of all property and that he has a
large surplus he desires to return in to the
quartermaster's department and, author
ity to do so has been given him.
Captain Thompson, the quartermaster
of the Presidio, who has recently been
made chief quartermaster of the depart
ment, has been succeeded at the Presidio
by First Lieutenant Nolan, Fourth Cay-
Private Fred Carver, Company G, Fifty
first lowa Regiment, died at the Division
Hospital yesterday of typhoid fever.

OF SIXTY FEET
MTRACTTLOUS ESCAPE FROM
DEATH OF FOBEST ANGEL.
Plunged From the Eoof of a House
on Poet and Leavenworth and
Seriously Injured.
Forest Angel, a painter, had an almost
miraculous escape from instant death
yesterday morning, and as it Is he Is
very aerlously injured.
HÂ© was engaged with two other men in
painting the house of Levi Strauss, cor
ner of Leavenworth and Post streets,
and was on the roof painting a dormer
window that Jutted out onto Post street.
While walking round the cornice he
missed his footing and fell. In falling he
struck the scaffold, which was about six
feet from the roof, and tried to save him
self by grasping hold of It, but the mo
mentum was too great and he went
downward.
An Iron fence surrounds the house and
Angel's left arm was caught on the point
of one of the pickets. It tore the mus
cles and ligaments of his arm into shreds
and fractured the bones. He struck the
stone sidewalk after falling a distance of
about sixty feet. He was picked up in an
unconscious condition and taken to the
Receiving Hospital, where Dr. "Weil found
that both bones of his left leg were
broken, his left arm and hand were frac
tured and terribly lacerated, and his left
collar-bone was dislocated and there was
a wound on his scalp, besides internal in
juries.
Dr. Well thought it would be necessary
to amputate the left arm. but deferred
the operation until Ang-el had thoroughly
recovered from the Bhock to his system.
Angel is a married man and lives at 31
Oak street.
Acts Like a Lunatic.
R. T. Owen, a sewing machine collector,
charged with assault to murder in stab
bing Alexander Bable, a bartender, last
week at Fourth and Howard streets, ap
peared before Judge Slogan yesterday for
his preliminary examination. His conduct
was such that the Judge ordered him to
be taken to the insane ward of the Re
ceiving Hospital so the Insanity Commis-
Bianers could examine him. The case was
continued until Saturday. Owen claimed
the officials in the City Prison tried sev
eral times to poison him.

NEW TORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW TORK, Oct. 24.â The burden of selling
Of stocks for foreign account, growing out of
th- 3 stringency for money abroad and the :
threatened outlook of the European political ;
Bltua/ion, coupled with the depressing effects
of the Supreme Court decision against the le- ;
gallty of the Joint Traffic Association proved
too much for the stock market to carry, and
prices of most of the active stocks are between
$1 and $2 a share lower to-night than
Saturday night. There was quite an active
first hour trading, and the volume of commis- i
sion house orders were executed which had j
come in response to the encnuracing three daya
advance of last week. Selling lor London ac- 1
as a feature from the start, but prices
were well sustained in the early dealings. The 1
professional traders soon detected evidences
of realizing on the part of interests which were
the large buyers la3t week, and they promptly
bid prii-es down In order to take the market
away from these. London's liquidation was on j
a very large scale, salÂ°s for that account be
ing estimated at 50,000 shares, and gave the
bears the needed backing for their attack.
Operations for the long account were almost !
Wholly relinquished, and when the Joint Traf- I
flc decision was announce. 1 ., the prices crumbled :
away before the attack of the bears without
much resistance. There was sufficient cover-
Ing at the close, however, to cause some sharp
fractional rallies.
The j rlni ipal weakness on the Joint Traf- ,
fie decision showed itself rather Inconsistently
among the grangers, Burlington falling an ex- ;
trenv 84, Rock Island 1% and St. Paul 1%. ;
The trunk lines on the other hand were not
markedly affected. New York â¢'â¢â¢rural showing
the principal effect with a decline of IVa. This â 
1? the more remarkable since the trunk lines,
although the Joint Traffic Association has had i
a lepal status up to to-day, have l.een ad
mittedly unable to maintain rates, while the
western mails, since the trans-Missouri asso
ciation was outlawed, having devised other
means for maintaining agreements. have j
suffered much less from rate cutting. The j
gelling of stocks for foreign account was re- I
fler-te.'. In a viulent upward movement of ster
ling exchange, the a-tual rates rising fully
Â»i of a cent for the pound. The Continentals ex
changes on London were at the same time ris
ing (fuite sharply, and the open market dis
count rate In London shewed a hardening ten
dency. All of this was in line with the active
war preparations r-poi-ted from London, and
showed the effort of the British financial cen
ter to call home its outstanding money re
sources. Not having any outstanding rre'llts
on liabnop against the United States. London
sold our securities freely with the same result.
The midday reaction in the foreign wheat
markets was the only feature of the day that
did not point to threatening developments, and
the later recovery and the continuance of large
demand in American markets for export coun
teracted this. The manipulative rise in To
bacco continued and helped to sustain the price
of Sugar. The bond market was active to a
degree and weakened In sympathy with stocks,
although the New Tork money market con
tinued easy in spite of stringency abroad. Total
Bales. J2.310.000.

THE LONDON MARKET.
NEW TORK, Oct. 24.â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: The stock
markets here opened steady to-day, but this
was quickly followed by a severe slump in
prices in which console led. Politics was the
ostensible reason for the fall, but monetary
conditions and the approaching settlement also |
had much to do with it. The Glasgow mar-,
ket was especially weak, and a sharp fall in
Grand Trunk is mainly accounted for by sell- j
ing from the quarters. Mines were flat. The ,
carry-over in that market to-day shows heavy ]
I differences to be faced. Americans were com- ;
I paratively steady â¢ but dull, closing at about
the lowest. How far the carry-over in general
stocks to-morrow may be relieved by the evi
dence of a bear account remains to be seen, but I
( money rates promise to be stiff. The disposi
j tion in city circles is to regard the political !
j situation seriously, but there is no approach
Ito a panic. Should hostilities with France
i actually occur, the position would be seriouÂ»
because such an event is certainly not being
discounted. The best financial quarters are,
'. however, still considering war as out of the
! question.
Gold is down to 77s 9%d. The London dis
count market has risen to 3% to 4 per cent.
New York is offering few bills here and is
again lending freely to this market on two or
three months.
I learn privately that the Bank of England |
has alredy contracted for the purchase of a fair j
amount, some of which will probably go Into
the bank to-morrow.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Oct. 24.â Wheat opened practically
unchanged, but quickly began to develop symp
toms of unrest regarding the threatening as
pect of European politics. Prices started to
advance, and in the course of half an hour the
December future, which opened at 67%@67%e,
had touched 6S%'J?6B%c, the high mark that
was reached on the curb Saturday afternoon.
English consols were practically unchanged at
the opening, reflecting an absence of increased
concern in financial circles over the Fashoda
affair, but the Liverpool grain market was un
settled and . stronger, indicating further alarm
among grain speculators. The latter naturally
had the most Influence with the kindred market
here and ordinary considerations were deprived
of effect In the face of possibilities of a Euro
pean war. Liverpool . opened with an advance
of from 2%@3d per oental and closed with from
l%@2VÂ»d net ealn for the day. Around the
noon hour the price took a further upturn from
a drop of % in English consols and an increase
of only 250,000 - bushels in the visible,
instead of 1,500,000 bushels, as expected. The
market continued on the advance to the end,
and December finally left off at 70%@70%c buy
ers, a gain of 2%c.
The same cause that Wheat had for advanc
ing was likewise operative in Corn, though to
a much smaller extent. On the hard spots,
however, the offerings by longs were generous,
and this had a' tendency to check the upturn.
December closed with a gain of %c. . -
The absence of shorts in Oats was account
able for a slack trade and Independent prices.
May rose %@%e. .
Enormous receipts of hogs everywhere de
pressed Provisions early. Later, however, this
was supplanted by the strengthening rains, and
toward the close the early decline was more
than recovered. Pork left off 7%c higher and
lard and ribs gained 6c each. ?;-'"? "â¢'"

LAKE SEWER
Vandalism With a
Motive.
THE MARSH MADE WORSE
HEALTH BOARD HUNTING THE
GUILTY PARTY.
Evidently a Scheme to Produce Re
lief by Running Sewage Where
It Is Offensive to the
Public.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
Broadway, Oct. 24.
A peeul ry was reported to
>llce this morning. It was the ex
lstence of a sliding door ingeniously in
eerted Into the outlet of the main lake
along the marsh, so that the sew
age instead of running out into the bay
would be spread over the adjoning terri
tory.
For a long time a great deal has been
Bald about the unsanitary condition of
the marsh at certain places, and cora
plaints have been made to the Superin
tendent of Streets and the Health Office
that the sewage was pouring through
larse leaks in the sewer and was a men
;lth of residents in that
part of the city.
This morni::*; a survey of the sewer re
vealed the fact that some one hati de
liberately cut a section out of the side
of the sewer and on either side of the
opening had placed cleats into which a
sliding door was fixed. When this door
is down the sewage cannot go any far
. : is over the surrounding
Territory, and when it is opened thi- sew
age runs out at the side and is almost
as bad. An investigation is being con
ducted By the police and the Street De- I
partment to find out if possible the au- j
thor of this remarkable piece of work.
It is not easy to understand what was
the object of this scheme. The work was
j done, and there is no doubt j
that s>>me well-understood motive Exist
ed to induce its undertaking. Perhaps
â¢me interested in having the marsh
up as other portions of it have been
wished, to make it as offensive as possi
>r>ing thereby to call such definite
attention to it that it wuuld no longer be
t'lleratt-d. Should the perpetrator be dis
â¢ii he will at once be prosecuted
by the Health Department for maintain
nuisance.
YON GIEGLINGER'S PIPES.
Executor Emerich Contests and
Claims the Rare Collection
as His Legacy.
OAKLAND. Oct. 2-I.â There will be a
contest over the estate of the late Arthur
yon Geiglinger, which consists principally
of a valuable and rare cabinet of meer
schaum pipes, valued at about JSOOO.
13y he provisions gf the will, this collec
tion is bequeathed to the son. Arthur yon
Gleglinger Jr. But it appears that after
having: made the will testator wrote a
letter to Executor Emerlch promising
him the pipes- as a final legacy.
Attorney Parcells appeared in court
this morning on behalf of young Gleg
linger and stated that an endeavor was
being made by the executor to use the
letter as an. olographic will. The letter
was to-day presented in court as such to
be used in a contest-, and the case will be
fought between Executor Emerich and
the son.

MISS BATES TO PLAY IBSEN
"MAY BLOSSOM" REVIVED AT
THE ALCAZAR.
New Tarns at the Orpheum â Reviv
als at Morosco's and the Tiv
oliâAt the Other
Theaters.
The Frawleys played the "Prisoner off
Zenda" at the Baldwin last night, start
ing out with an insult to the adapter
and the audience and ending up with a
victory for the play, a victory for Miss
Bates and almost another for Mr.
Frawley. The insult lay in the omis
â¢ion of Mr. Rose's prologue, an original !
**t of playwriting, dramatic, distin
guished, and delightfully picturesque
la fa^t the most artistic act in the en
tire rlay. Perhaps Mr. Frawley cut it
out because of the expensive costumes;
or maybe in a moment of modesty he
concluded that his oneâtwoâthree
jab! style of swordsmanship would not
suffice for the. dueling scene. Anyway
he cut tho prologue without a blush,
and throughout the first act the sterner
element of the audience cursed him for
it roundly, and women hissed regrets.
Something of this feeling must have
gone over the lights and onto the stage,
for I never saw a first act of any piece
more abominably played. The company
was at its nervous worst, and the cur
tain went down to a lonely little thin
line of back-row applause that soundod
suspiciously usher-like.
But In the next act the play, assisted
by Miss Bates, asserted itself, aid Mr.
Frawley warmed as I have never
known him to warm before, and the
atmospliere became cordial and glad all
round. The actors worked for all they
were- worth; all, â¢with the exception of
Miss Bates, playing in the open key of
bronze escutcheons have been carried off.
Detective Shorey hats been detailed to in
vestigate the case.

WILLIAMSON SAYS HE
IS NOT A DUPE
CONFIDENT HIS LOVE HAS NOT
BEEN WASTED.
Says the City Officials Have Taken
Altogether Too Much Intereoc
in His Love Affairs.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, Oct. 24.
Randolph S. Williamson enjoys the
unique distinction of being: in love with
an unknown young lady whom he has
never seen and who has broken every ap
pointment with him that she has made.
Mr. Williamson's love-making has be
come rather troublesome to him, but he
declares that he will eventually find the
young lady who has stolen his heart and
that they will live happily ever after. il~
has prepared the following statement,
which he says is absolutely true and
which he believes is necessary to set right
some of the impressions gained of his af
fairs by the Police Department and the
Mayor:
I see in the papers a statement concerning a
lady find myself. I will ask you very kindly to
correct some errors. I will say I have had
divers thoughts concerning who wrote the K-t
ters to me. and I have thought that sometimes
they were written by some one who had gome
thing against me. Hut I do not know th;it
this is anybody's business except the lady's
and my own. I really think I have gained the
affection of this lady and I think I will yet
marry her, for I believe everything I haxe done
in this case is agreeable to her wishes.
I did Dot show th>Â» Mayor my correspond
ence, neither the Chief of Police, but to some
â¢ >ther official to whom Mayer Thomas intro
duced me I showed my letters. There was not
a bundle of them, but only seven. I wish th"
Mayor and the Chief would not say so much
about my affairs, nr something may happen to !
them that they might not like. I have not sent
the lady any more money, and 1 will say I do ;
not receive all the money I wish fn>m my mar- i
ried Bister, a.s the Mayor has stated. I have a
very hard life and there are many thinps upon
which I do net agree with others. I do not
approve of the lady being- ppoken of as "a
girl." and furthermore-. I believe I am fully
at using my own judgment in the mat
ttr. I am certain that I am not the dape of I
i man. as Mayor Thomas presumes, and I be- j
lieve I shall yet meet the young lady, who Is i
said to Vt- Miss Mabel A. Ptarr, and that our
marriage will take, place. Yours very truly,
RANDOLPH S. WILLIAMSON.
Mr. Williamson said this afternoon that
he had never met the young lady, but he
is confident from her correspondence that
she is a very estimable person and that
she will yet be his wife. Mayor Thomas
says that Williamson's a.rtU>ng are the
most peculiar hn has ever met with.
A Residence Burned.
ALAMEDA, Oct. 24.â The residence of
James Sheeran, Santa Clara avenue, near
Walnut street, was destroyed by fire
shortly before 10 o'clock this evening. The
fire was caused by the servant overturn
ing a coal oil lamp in the cellar. The
damage was about $1000 and was covered
by an insurance of $1500 in the Fireman's
Fund.
melodrama, and the play, even though
decapitated, won out on its own
strength. "The Prisoner of Zenda,"
after experiencing everything from
jeipularity to Frawley, stands to-day
the finest specimen of modern romance
In the English drama. It is not a model
in construction and character; the
"comic relief" is absurdly conventional
and some of the politer humor is not
fortunate; but the plot, the atmosphere
and the action are splendid. Even -it
this time of day one can marvel at the
audacious craft which reduces old
world royalty, sentimentality and
heroics to the plausible impertinences
of modernity. 'Zenda" is the most real
istic fairy tale that this age has seen
done up in silks and scenery; it is, in
its class, a classic, and one that is act
able. I-n snite of the leading part's
Hamlet-like monopoly, It is a piece
â within the talents of any good stock
company, because it adapts itself to
almost any scheme of acting.
It was played last night as melo
drama, and bar the disasters of the first
act, was played successfully. Miss
Bates is quite an ideal Flavia. She
gives to the part the full measure of
tenderness, beauty and sweet dignity
that was more or less denied by her
predecessors: and she never overdoes.
Her art is sensitive and secure. Mr.
Frawley's acting is not usually a good
! natured subject for the professional
i first nighter, but he was surprisingly
' different last night; he showed less self
consciousness than ever before, and
there was something of humor as well
as energy in his work. Mr. Edwards
played Sapt vigorously well if rather
obviously, and Miss La "Verne was im
pressively melodramatic as Antoinette
de Mauban. Mr. Roberts did as much
as any one can do with Black Michael;
Mr. Hickman was conventionally comic
in the impossible part of the artist, and
Mr. Mathleu advanced himself a notch
in the part of Rupert.
The few lbs nites in San Francisco,
and the many admirers of Miss Bates
will doubtless be glad to learn that she
is t<> play Nora Helmer in a special
matinee of "a Doll's House" at the
Baldwin a week from Friday.

PETITION FOR AN INJUNCTION
SHE WANTED HER HUSBAND

Capitalist Elkam L. Lipka Is Also
Defendant in Rather a Sensa

Suit.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Oct. 24.
Susan L. Hollocher, who is suing for a
divorce from Michael L. Hollocher on the
j ground of extreme cruelty, petitioned Su-
I perlor Judge Ogden this afternoon,
| through her attorney, William H. Waste,
j for an order in the way of an injunction
| to enjoin her alleged cruel and erratic
spouse from burning down the family
residence, near Berkeley.
The divorce case was to have been heard
i before Judge Ogden to-day, but owing to
! the time being taken up by a trial of a
case which preceded It on the docket the
divorce trial went over for one week.
It was then that Attorney Waste asked
, that an injunction issue against Hol
i locher to prevent him from even visiting
I the house where the family Is ensconced.
! He asked that Hollocher be arrested for
j his many wild threats or that he be put
j under heavy bonds, but Judge Ogden de
) nied the petition, holding that there Is no
| power on earth that can prevent a man
legally from visiting his own home or the
\ home of his wife.
Another sensational divorce suit was
! filed to-day) wherein Mrs. Emily Llpka
: asks for an absolute separation from her
alleged cruel spouse. Elkam M. J,ipka, a
capitalist doing business at 845 Broadway.
The complaint alleges innumerable acts of
i cruelty and charges Infelicity of the most
flagrant sort, but no corespondents are
mentioned by name.
The parties were united In ISSO, and the
j fruits of the marriage are two bright boys,
i They have resided here many years, and.
j aside from any Interest that Mrs. Lipka
; might hold in her husband's capitalistic
i circumstances, she Is quite well to do her
self. D. Mitchell is Mrs. Lipka's attor
ney and M. C. Chapman has been retained

A LONG-FELT WANT.
Alameda Citizens Will Try to Pur-
chase the Old Ferry Depot Clock.
ALAMEDA, Oct. 24.â Some public-spir
ited citizens of Alameda have concluded
that it Is about time that a clock should
be placed in the tower of the new City
Hall. The round apertures near the top
of the tower have peered down upon the
citizens of the Encinal city like the eye
less sockets of a skull. On several occa
sions attempts have been made to buy
a town clock by public subscription, but
the undertaking has always fallen
through just when the prospect of real
ization seemed brightest. When the
clock proposition failed of success a city
official suggested that a set of chimes be
placed in the tower instead of a time
piece. The sum of $375 was subscribed
for this purpose. When it was learned
that the rhlmes would cost $1800 efforts
in that direction ceased.
The empty tower has disturbed the Ala
meda mind ever since the City Hall was
formally opened; but now the citizens
down the house, while their acting added
much to the success of the play. The
"Span of Life" continues all week, and
will be followed by "Hogan's Alley."
Orpheum.
The Orpheum for this week has a long
list of legitimate stars and all are good.
John C. Rice and Sally Cohen were last
seen here with May Irwin, but they are
none the less funny in vaudeville than in
the legitimate. The skit produced by Mr.
Rice and Miss Cohen is entitled "Our
Honeymoon," and deals with the story
of a young couple who, on their honey
moon, suddenly find that they could live
for a few hours without the other in
sight. The one is anxious to attend a
prize-fight and the other to attend a little
dance at the house of a friend. After all
sorts of excuses each manages to go their
separate way only to later got found out
in their little stories. The lines are very
funny and the situations all that could
\-,i' arik<-<] for. Mr. Rice shines as the man
who has attended a prize-fight instead of
a prayer meoting, and as a soubrette Mi.ss
Cohen is a star. The Rossow Midgets
have ever been favorites here and their
boxing match and feats of strength have
not lost interest. They were received
with rounds of applause last night, but
the most interest centered in the appear
ance of little Charlie as a female imper
sonator. Hi.s coon songs were applauded
to the echo. He has a cute way, he car
ries the audience with him and his voice
is much stronger than one might expect
from such a mite of humanity. The
Royles in "Captain Impudence" were
greater favorites than ever. Their work
is of the kind that does not tire â in fact,
it sort of grows on one. The same can be
said of Miss Mary Norman, who will not
be seen after this week. Louis M. Gra
nat, the whistler, is a favorite, while
Barry and Felix never fail to bring down
the house. The show altogether is one of
the Orpheum's best. The biograph has
new views.
Alcazar.
The revival of David Belasco's "May
Blossom" at the Alcazar last evening
proved an enjoyable occasion for tho
large audience present. The play, a four
act drama, was one of Belasco's earlier
successes, and its fnmous run at the
M;i'lison-square Theater is still fresh in
the memories of New York theater-goers,
and the play itself has been seen here be
fore. "May Blossom" and "The Old
Homestead,'' along with a number of kin
dred plays have been too thoroughly es
tablished in the opinion of the public for
these many years to need comment now.
For a first night performance the play
was creditably presented by the Alcazar
company. George Osbourne as Tom Blos
som, and Miss Juliet Crosby as Millie,
were the ones particularly Reserving of
mention, the former especially. The
"May Blossom" will be the bill through
the week, and it is promised a successful
run.
Morosco's.
The old familiar drama "The Streets of
New York" was produced last evening
at Morosco's Grand Opera-bouse, with
James M. Brophy in the leading part of
Tom Badger, bank clerk, daredevil, and
at last philanthropist. It is hard to say
where he got his idea of the character
of the old-time Californlan. He dressed
for this part more like a Mexican than
one of the Golden West. Aside from this
his conception of the part was good, if
The fao-Bimlle y^Tj^ - "/iwTT m^ m la on ever \prappe?

have struck a new idea, and the gentle
men who advance it guarantee they will
see it through. They propose to make
an offer to the Harbor Commissioners of
San Francisco to purchase the four-dial
clock that for years told the time of day
from the steeple of the old ferry depot.
The amount of money subscribed for the
chimes will be asked for, and if it is given
the K^iitlemen interested in the matter
will solicit no more from the citizens. A
meeting will be held this week, when the
gentlemen will organize an association
that will have for its sole object the ac
quiring of a clock for the City Hall tower.
Alameda Has an Anti-Marriage Club.
ALAMEDA, Oct. 24.â Several prominent
young men of this city, all of marriage
able age, have forsaken the society of the
fairer sex and organized a bachelors'
club. They have pledged themselves by
the most solemn and binding oaths not
to join the ranks of benedicts. The
initial meeting was hold Saturday even
ing at the. office of Dr. \\ . R. Hughes,
where a permanent organization was ef
fected. Amons; those who signed the anti
nuptial agreement were Dr. Hughes,
Edward James, Clyde Conkey, George
Densmore George. Innes, Fred Elster,
Rulph Elster, Harry Zimmerman and T.
C. Coughiin. Several other gentlemen
who have been crossed in love have ap
plied for membership. The club will hold
semi-monthly meetings for the present,
but in the near future will furnish per
manent headquarters where the members
can congregate every evening. Among
the rules of the organization is one that

Major Tilden Returns.
ALAMEDA, Oct. 24.â Major C. L. Til
den of the First California Regiment has
arrived at his home, 3525 Chestnut street,
on a three months' leave from Manila.
He says his future course as to his com
mand will depend on the condition of his
health at the expiration of his leave. The
doctors state that hit* ailment is of such
a nature that his recovery will be very
slow. Major Tilden said it would not be
consistent with his position to express an
opinion as to the annexation of the Phil
ippines. He intimateil. however, that It
is not desirable to take in all of the isl
ands. "I think, the volunteers who have
borne the brunt of the campaign should
be- sent home," said the major. "They
dropped their occupation to fight the bat
tles of their country. The battles are over
and the remaining work should be left to
the regular army."
Murderous Assault.
ALAMEDA. Oct. 24.â Charles Degreef,
an Italian, has been arrested on complaint
of Howard Davis, who charges him with
assault with a deadly weapon. Both men
are residents of San Francisco. Davis al
leges that Pegreef enticed him to Hay &
Wright's ship yards Friday and beat him
into insensibility with a club. The man's
head was badly battered, and murder
would undoubtedly have resulted had not
some workmen stopped the assault. De
greef made his escape, but was arrested
Surrday in San Francisco. He was brought
to the Alaxneda Jail this evening. Degreef
claims that Davis attacked him first with
a knife.
Dissension in the Ranks.
ALAMEDA. Oct. 24.â The competitive
i drill "f Companies A. E and D, which took
pi ice in Alameda Saturday night, has
caused a little dissension in the ranks of
the organization. On account of the rain
Colonel de Wolf postponed the drill and
went home. Later, when Captain Bather
of Company A appeared, he ordered the
contest to proceed. Confusion and dis
satisfaction riHult^d, which the officers of
the regiment have smoothed over by de
claring Saturday's affair off. Another
drill has been ordered November ">. The
trophy to be contested for i.-; a silver cup
and a gold medal offered by the regiment.

the University of California will deliver
an address at the First Presbyterian

not strictly original. Landers Stevens as
Bloodgood, the banker, was good. Of all
the company he had best committed his
lines to memory. Julia Blanc, as Mrs.
Puffy, was appreciated about as much as
any, sharing considerate of the applause
with her "husband," represented V>y Fred
J. Butler. For one new to the stage Miss
Maud Miller filled a somewhat difficult
part with credit. The aristocratic daugh
ter of Banker Bloodgood was taken Dy
Lorena Atwood. whose experience before
the footlights fitted her well for the char
acter. The play Is well staged, and the
fire scene is as good as fire scenes usually
are. "The Indian" follows next week.
Another Delightful Recital.
The fourth of the delightful series of
Heinrich recitals was given at Sher
man & Clay Hall last evening to
an appreciative audience. The more
these singers are heard the better they
are liked, and the remaining recitals on
Wednesday afternoon ami Friday evening
will undoubtedly be crowded. Mr. Heln
rleh also announces two "intellectual sing
ing lessons" to be given Wednesday and
Friday mornings at 11 o'clock.
Chutes Theater.
The new bill at the Chutes Free Theater
went with a snap and bang last evening?,
especially that portion of it which in
cluded the Smith family of rifle shots.
Lillian Smith has no superior in the wond
as a markswoman, and she. performed
some marvelous feats of glass ball break-
Ing McÃrlde and James are clever Irish
comedians, and the political pictures in
Eusapia's transformation dance were re
ceived with great interest. When Lie
contented faces of Charles L. Patton and
H S Martin loomed up on the skirts of
the dancer there was a burst of wild ap
plause tnat shook the rafters. Kelly and
Violate changed their songs and dupli
cated their success of last week. The rest
of the bill was good. There will be an
other amateur iafehtj3n_Thursday.
Olympia.
The Olympia Music Hall has a strong
card in the four Florences, a troupe of
acrobats from Keith's. New York. Their
work takes place along with the very best !
that has ever been seen in this city. Their
double somersault to shoulders is great, :
and is alone worth seeing. The women
of the troupe are particularly clever.
Trene Franklin and others fill out a good
bill.

Services Over the Body of the Mur-
dered Woman in the Cathe
dral.
If the tolling of the bell In St. Mary's
Cathedral yesterday morning reached the
ears of Patrick Kepnan through the
grated windows of the City Prison, as the
body of his wife, whom he shot down in
cold blood, was carried up to the steps
into the house of God, he did not appear
to hear It. His wounds are healed, and
with returning strength comes renewed
determination to fight against death upon
the gallows.
Yesterday morning at 9 o'clock the body
was taken from the Keenan home to the
church. Behind the casket followed five
children, left motherless by the cruel
crime, and fatherless, too, as the law will
doubtless make the murderer pay the
penalty.

Pioneer Granger Has Proof That
Vast Tracts Will Soon Be Well
Fitted for Growing
Beets.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Oct. 24.
B. F. Granger, one of the old-timers of
Alvarado, has recently proved that a re
markable change is taking place in the
low-lying lands in that section of the
county through which flows the San Lean
dro Creek. An immense tract of from
twelve to fifteen thousand acres is being
reclaimed by nature and in a few years,
instead of being a swamp, will be first
class beet-growing land.
Mr. Granger has been making notes of
this change for thirty years, and he has
proved that in IS6S a fence, which was
then five feet high, crossing the swamp is
now almost entirely submerged, owing to
the successive deposits upon the swamp,
which have lifted the land higher and
hiKher each season. The land level of the
broad expanse of swamp ha.s risen until
it is a swamp no mere, and this last sum
mer being unusually dry made it possible
to have grown beets ail over this area.
Instead of mud there is hard soil and
water is not reached by laborers who dig
for it until a depth of three or four feet
is gained. Old inhabitants remember
when the land was so soft that it was not
even available for eat\e to feed upon it.
Should the rise continue for a few years
mere nearly fifteen thousand acres will be
added to the arabk: land of this county,
and a marsh which has been for years
the resort of duck-hunters will disappear.
Most of the gun clubs of the bay towns
have houses on some part of the marsh,
and although they need not move them
at present, It will not be long before they
will have to locate in new quarters, if
they wish to shoot duck.
It is said that owners of the marsh lands
have already raised the valuation on their
property in anticipation that the geolog
ical work slowly going on will be com
pleted in a few years.
Many old residents point out land marks
by which they are able to gauge the effect
of the great change. The newly made land
is declared to be first-class soil for beet-
KTOWingr, and as there Is ;i large beet
factory at Alvarado the passing of the
marsb will add greatly to the commercial
value of that district.
SILVA LANDED IN JAIL.
OAKLAND. Oct. 24.â Detective Denny
Holland to-day arrested Tony Silvu at
San Pablo, Contra Costa County, on a
charge of embezzlement, preferred by
Joaquin Silvieru. and locked him up in the
City Prison. The circumstances are some
what peculiar.
Silviera conducts a dairy, and Silva was
his employe. A few days ago Silviera had
ordered Silva to take a man out to the
ranch, but the employe, fearing- that the
strangi-r was to supersede him as driver,
refused to do so. He even resisted when
Silviera put him off the wagon to take the
man out himself. Thereupon the employe
had his boss arrested.
As soon as the case was disposed of Bil-
Vtera swore out a warrant for Silva's ar
rest for embezzlement, alleging that he
had Intrusted a -orse to the accused, di- :
renting him to take the animal to tne
ranch, and that instead Silva sold tne
horse and appropriated the proceeds to his ,
own use.
Verdict of Accidental Death.
BERKELEY. Oct. 24.â ThÂ» inquest held
in Ran Pablo this afternoon over thÂ«> re
mains of Peter Anderson and AVilliam
Roach, the two unfortunate victims of
body of the murdered woman, the solemn
intonations of his voice frequently being
stilled by the walling and sobbing of the
unfortunate children. At 10 o'clock the
tx fly was carried from the church to the
grave and the children returned to the
care of those who came to their aid when
the tragedy left them without means of
livelihood.
The case of Koennn was called In Judge
Low's court yesterday morning 1 . As he
was not able to appear in court a contin
uance was made till to-morrow. It is said
his defense will be temporary insanity.

ANNISTON, Ala., Oct. 24.â The War
Investigating Commission sat from 9
until 5:30 to-day, and examined about
a dozen witnesses, including a number j
of offlers and men of the regular ,
troops, as well as a number of volun- j
teer officers. It is now expected that
the Commission will leave for Hunts
ville to-morrow night.
Replying to charges made by a Sig
nal Corps patient in the Chickamauga
Hospital, Surgeon Drake said he had
seen maggots on one occasion in a box
in the hospital, but never on patients.
Often the men came there covered with
vermin, but they did nÂ«'t remain so.
Major John H. Heatwole, chief com
missary of subsistance, said the quality
of the rations had been excellent. As
for the quantity, a man would have to
be a gormand to eat it all.
General Dodge read a letter from Dr.
Seaman of New York, who was before
the Commission in Washington, in
which he corrected an error in his tes
timony. He stated that he had received
only the regular army rations for the
convalescents on the steamer uudam
from Porto Kico to New York. He says
that such supplies as had been received
up to the night previous to sailing had
been received from the relief societies. I
"During the night," he continued, "the I
hospital ship Relief arrived and early I
the next morning 1 boarded the Relief
and personally secured, without any
requisition, the additional supplies
enumerated in the receipt signed by me.
Until my conference yesterday with
Major Bradley I believed these supplies,
like many others, were bought by out
side contributions and were not Gov
ernment supplies."
The letter is dated October 16, and is
directed to the surgeon general of the
army.
Major Vickers, who was inspector
general for the Second Division of the
Third Corps at Chickamauga, at
tributed the troubles in that camp to
the shallowness of the sinks. He said, i
also, that some of the regimental offi- |
cers insisted on making poor selection
of camp sites, and in one instance a
Mississippi colonel, who had put his
men in a swamp, had insisted upon re
maining on the ground as the Missis
eippians had a natural affinity for
swamps. Nevertheless his men were
taken sick. Major Vickers also com
plained that the drinking water was
poor. Asked as to the competency of
the surgeons at the hospital he said
there was one man in the hospital
whose proneness to profanity unfitted
him for the service. This man was
Major Hubbard, surgeon in the Ninth
New York. "His profanity was of such
a villainous character," said Major
Vickers, "that it pretty nearly made
me sick, and I knew it could not have |
a pleasant effect on patients."
Lieutenant Colonel Bisbee, in com
mand of the First Infantry, told the j
story of the transportation of his regi- I
ment to Santiago, briefly described the j
fighting about Santiago, spoke of his j
experience in Cuba, of the return to i
Montauk Point, and of the stay at that !
place and the transfer south. Asked if j
the landing at Santiago could have j
been accomplished if opposed, he re- j
plied: "The facilities were so poor that
I think not; at least, I should say if I
had been on shore no enemy would
have been permitted to land. I cannot
say how it was with the Spaniards."
He said there was considerable dif
ficulty in getting food while in front of
Santiago, "but we had enough." He
added: "If there had been more to eat,
the men would probably have been
Bicker."
He expressed the opinion that the
only deprivation had been in not hav
ing proper food for the sick. They could
not take the food in their condition, he
said. He thought the rations contained
too much fat meat for the climate.
Colonel Bisbee stated that himself and
sixteen men were the only members of
his regiment who had not been ill at
some time during the Santiago cam
paign. "It had been impossible to secure
medical supplies," said the witness,
"and if we had them we could not have
carried them." He added that the army
â was badly broken up in that respect,
and it did not get into shape promptly,
for some reason. He said the men were
just beginning to break in health when
Santiago surrendered, and the capitula
tion came at just the right time. He
did not believe there was a sufilclent
number of doctors in the Cuban cam
paign. He thought the contract sur
geons were capable doctors, but they
were not familiar with army methods,
and did not know how to get the neces
sary medicines. Speaking generally of
the Cuban experience, he expressed the
opinion that the supplies had been as
liberal as could have been reasonably
expected.
Major Dempsey of the Second Regi
ment Infantry covered much the same
ground as Colonel Bisbee. He said his
command had never during the San
tiago campaign suffered for want of
supplies. Men had sometimes at night
felt ths want of covering, but not of
food. Not more than half the men in
the regiment were fit for duty at the
time of the surrender of Santiago. He
had heard a doctor say that quinine
and castor oil were the only medicines
he coul get.
Other members of the two regiments I
of regulars stationed here who were ex- j
amir-ed were Captain Waring of the
First; Lieutenant Lutz of ihe Second;
Quartermaster Katz of the First; F'ri
vate Feldus of the First; Quarteimas
ter Sergeant Stahl of the Second and j
Private Hounchell of the Second. All !
testified that while there was a differ- !
ence in rations issued while the troops I
were in the trenches in the vicinity of
Santiago, there was no real suffering
on the part of the men on this account.
They expressed themselves as satisfied
that they received as good attention as '
they could have expected under the cir- |
cumstances.
Colonel H. M. Seaman of the Fourth
Wisconsin complained that the sup
plies his regiment had drawn at Camp
Douglas, including clothing, shores and
arms, had been poor. He did not con- I
sider the men sufficiently well clad for I
the harsh weather, and said they had j
suffered somewhat on account of the
recent cold;

Pardo Lucero Gives Up
the Ghost.
DIES IN MONTEREY HOSPITAL
TO BE BURIED IN THE POTTERS'
FIELD.
His Great Age Proved by Record of
Missions Los Angeles and
Soledad â Leaves a Sister
in Mexico.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SALINAS, Oct. 24.â Pardo Lucero,
alias El Vaquero, whose age, as shown
by the records of Missions Los Ange
les and Soledad, was 125 years, died
at the County Hospital this afternoon
"of old age." Deceased came from
Sonora, Mex., after the Yaqui rebellion
of 1825, and settled near where San
Diego now is. In 1848 he went to min
ing, but for the past forty years has
worked at sheep herding for David
Jacks in Chualar Cayon. He has trav
eled the State extensively and was well
known for the last seventy-five years
as the second "Old Gabriel." He leaves
a sister in Mexico and some property on
the Yaqui River in Sonora, Mex.
For several days after Pardo Lucero
was admitted to the County Hospital
he seemed to recover and become
stronger. He would, however, have
weak spells, which would leave him
speechless. His death was expected,
but not for some months. Last Friday
night he experienced a severe attack of
heart failure, from which he never ral
lied. He became unconscious and un
til his death at 12 o'clock never ral
lied or partook of drink or nourishment.
His old friend, "Old Parlto," was called
and was present when the end came.
Lucero seemed to be sleeping easily,
and only when "Parito" and the su
perintendent noticed the change of
color in his face was it discovered that
the old man had passed away in his
sleep. "Parlto" wept like a child and
had to be led away.
Lucero, despite his old age. was well
built and stalwart. His dying mo
ments were peaceful, and though he
was buried this afternoon in the
Paupers' Cemetery, he will, like "Old
Gabriel," be talked of for years to
come. He was never married and his
property on the Yaqui River, Sonora,
Mex., will go to his sister, if alive.
Mrs. Foster, now in the hospital, aged
110, may soon go also.
TERRIBLE PRIVATIONS
OF A KLONDIKE PARTY
Two Men and a Woman Arrive at
Skaguay After a Thrilling
Experience.
SEATTLE, Oct. 24.â T. A. Baker of
Portland. Or., who arrived from Alaska
last night, says he met two men and a
woman at Skaguay who had just finished
a trip of incredible hardships over the
Edmondton trail. They were Henry
Mitchell and wife of Goldendale and
' George Le Fevre of Spokane, who left
Spokane fourteen months ago for the
! Klondike by the overland route. \V hen
they started they had 2000 pounds of pro
visions and twenty-one horses. Now they
1 have nothing. All their supplies and ani
mals wore lost and they consider them
| selves fortunate in having escaped with
They Haw provisions scattered along the
trail from the time they were well up In
i the interior until they left for the coast
i and found several graves of those who
i had perished in attempting to reach the
I gold fields. Several times they lost their
i way and it was only by good fortune that
i the trail was found again. After travel
ing several hundred miles and perceiving
that it was useless to attempt to get
through by keeping to the regular rbute,
they made directly for the coast, going
I down one of the rivers to the south of
I Skaguay.
HUNTER UNEARTHS A
GHASTLY MYSTERY
Skeleton of a Man Undoubtedly
Murdered Found in a Ravine
Near Hollister.
HOLLISTER. Cal., Oct. 24.â A deep ra
vine leading into the Pajaro River re
vealed a ghastly mystery to-day when
Benjamin FJint, while out hunting quail,
found the body of a man, evidently the
victim of a cruel murder. The body was
found encased in clothes and a heavy
overcoat, the latter up around the neck,
showing that it had been dragged some
distance. No shoes or stockings were on
the corpse, which was that of a large
man about six feet in height. The pock
ets were empty save for a few car
tridges and some matches. The flesh was
all gone from the body and the features
were unrecognizable. The right side of
the skull was badly crushed. The body
was lying on its back, half buried in
sand and had eveidently been in that po
sition for a year. No clew to its identity
could be found. The skeleton and clothes
are now at the Morgue and Coroner Black
and District Attorney Hudner are mak
ing a searching investigation. The scene
of the mystery is a deep dry run seldom
visited.
Three Lives Lost at a Fire.
DALLAS, Texas, Oct. 24.â Fire to-day

burned. Mrs. Wesson Jumped from a sec
ond-story window and sustained probably
fatal injuries.
TkE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 25, 1898.
DROWNED IN THE
BAY AT VALLEJD
Fate of Two San Fran
cisco Ladies.
MISS EMMA A. SMITH IS ONE
MRS. V. RYAN, HER NIECE, THE
OTHER VICTIM.
Both Bodies Recovered â No Witness
to the Sad Occurrence and Only
Surmise as to How It
Happened.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VALLEJO, Oct. 24.â Miss Emma A.
Smith of San Francisco and her niece,
Mrs. Vincent Ryan, were drowned in
the bay here to-day shortly before
noon. They had been staying at a
huuse on Florida street, a few yards
from the water front. The younger
woman had been under treatment at a
sanitarium at St. Helena and came to
Vallejo last Thursday. She was suf
fering from melancholia, and her aunt
was taking care of her.
The two ladies left the house about
10 o'clock this morning for a walk and
were not seen again alive. Their bod
ies were found shortly after noon, that
of Miss Smith near Kane's wharf and
that of Mrs. Ryan near Virginia street
wharf, where the tide had washed it.
There is nothing to indicate how the
two ladies came to their death, but it
is surmised that Mrs. Ryan, in her de
mented condition. Jumped from the
wharf and her aunt leaped into the
water to save her, or that Miss Smith
was seized by Mrs. Ryan and they fell
from the wharf together. Both were
fully dressed and showed no sign of a
struggle.
Coroner Trull was notified and the
bodies were taken to Connolly's under
taking parlors and prepared for burial.
It was learned that each had a brother
in San Francisco, J. F. Smith and W.
R. Snell. They were notified and ar
rived in Vallejo to-night to take charge
of the remains. An inquest will be
held to-morrow morning and th.c re
mains will be shipped to San Francisco
to-morrow night.
Mr. Smith received the Coroner's dis
patch from Yallejo at 5 o'clock yester
day afternoon and immediately left for
that place. Inquiries made at his resi
dence last night revealed the fact that
Miss Smith had been a sufferer for
some time from mental nervousness.
Three months ago Mrs. Ryan accom
panied her to the sanitarium at St. He
lena, and about two weeks ago they
went to Vallejo, hoping the change
would prove beneficial. At times the
unfortunate woman was very violent.
The family are of the opinion that Miss
Smith attempted to throw herself into
the water, and that in trying to pre
vent her from doing so Mrs. Ryan was
dragged off the wharf and both were
drowned.
SHOT TO DEATH IN A
PRINCETON SALOON
William St. Louis Slain by John
Ashley, the Bartender, Who Is
Charged With Murder.
COLUSA, Oct. 24.â William St. Louis
was shot and almost instantly killed by
John Ashley, a bartender, in Hoessli's
saloon at Princeton Sunday night. St.
Louis, who was slightly Intoxicated, came
into the saloon and began quarreling with
another man, when Ashley came up to
him and told him to either behave himself
or get out. St. Louis made some insult
ing reply, when, without further cere
mony, Ashley drew his pistol and fired.
St. Louis dropped to his hands and knees
and Ashley fired again, when St. Louis
regained his feet and rushed out of the
room, his shirt covered with blood. Ash
ley followed him to the door and fired a
third shot, when St. Louis exclaimed, "I
am done for," and sank to the ground.
Friends hurried to St. Louis' assistance
and carried him into his mother-in-law's
hotel, where he died an hour later with
out regaining consciousness. Ashley came
to Colusa and gave himself into the cus
tody of the Sheriff.
Eye-witnesses say it was a very cold
blooded affair. The murdered man leaves
a young widow and a baÃy girl about a
year old. Coroner R. A. Gray held an in
quest on the remains and the jury brought
in a verdict of "Murder, caused by a gun
shot wound fired by John Ashley."
STILL NO TRACE OF WANDELL.
The Young Rancher Believed to Have
Been Murdered.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 24.â Not one trace has
yet been found of Ben Wandell, the young
rancher who so mysteriously disappeared
from his cabin near Mount Hamilton. It
is now firmly believed that he was mur
dered, but why and by whom is a mys
tery. The Sheriff is busy on the case, but
gives out no information.
Edwin Gould's New Job.
NEW YORK, Oct. 24.â At tfce meeting
of the St. Louis and Southwestern Rail
road in this city to-day, S. W. Fordych
declined re-election to the presidency and
nominated Edwin Gould, who was unani
mously elected. Russell Harding of the
Great Northern Railroad Company was
elected to succeed Edwin Gould in the
vice-presidency .
Sonoma Bond Election Fails.
SONOMA, Oct. 24.â A special election
held here to-day to bond the town for a
municipal water system lacked four votes
of the necessary two-thirds to carry the

NOT HE BROWNS
BUT TRHE BARRONS
An Auburn Mystery Un-
raveled.
GOSSIP FOR SOCIAL CIRCLES
WEALTHY COUPLE ASSUME THE
NAME OF BROWN.
Purchase a Fine Ranch and Settle
Down â Death of George E.
Barron Discloses the
Deception.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
AUBURN, Oct. 24.â Auburn society
will be startled when it learna that the
Browns, who recently purchased the
handsome fruit farm and villa home of
the Pointings, are not the Browns, but
their true name is Barron. Several
months ago Mr. and Mrs. G. E. Brown,
hailing from San Francisco, located in
Auburn for the benefit of Mr. Browns
health, who unmistakably showed signs
of lung trouble. At first they rented,
and while they did not entertain they
lived well and apparently had lots of
money. This latter fact was verified
some time later by the purchase of the
Ponting ranch at a big price, for a
ranch would certainly not be a moneyed
Investment to a sick man. A week or
so ago Mr. and Mrs. Brown went to
San Francisco and it is learned that
Mr. Brown has since died.
On reading the account in The Call
of Saturday last of the death of George
E. Barron The Call's representative
here began to compare notes and now
finds that George E. Barron of San
Francisco was none other than George
E. Brown of Auburn. The deed to the
Ponting place gives the name of Bar
ron. The agent who made the sale says
the name first given him was Brown,
but when the deed was filed the name
recorded was Barron. George E.
Brown of Auburn was certainly George
E. Barron of San Francisco, son of
millionaire Barron and noted for the
bitterness of the contest he waged in
the courts of San Jose against the pro
visions of his father's will. It is be
lieved that prior to their departure for
San Francisco Mr. Barron made a gift
deed to his wife, or at any rate the
woman who passed as such.

MRS. BOTKIN CAN
ONLY BE TRIED
IN THIS STATE
Superior Judges in Bank Grant
Her Application for Habeas
Corpus in Part.
Question as to Whether She Can Be Tried
Under Section 27 of the Penal Code
to Be Decided Saturday.
Mrs. Cordelia Botkin has won her fighi
against extradition to Delaware, and it
she is tried at all for the poisoning of Mrs.
John P. Dunning the trial must take place
In the local courts.
Such was the decision given yesterday
by Superior Judges Oook, W;Â»J!ace. Sea
well. Troutt and Borden in the matter
of. the writ of habeas corpus sued out in
behalf of Mrs. Botkin by her attorneys.
Messrs. Knight and McGowan. The
Judges in granting the writ hold that the
Legislature has neglected to provide for
such an emergency, for under the present
law the defendant is not a fugitive from
justice, not having- been in the State
where the crime wus consummated at any
time.
Mrs. Botkin. accompanied by her sister,
appeared" in court and listened attentivel}
to the reading of the decision by Judge
Cook. Near her sat her attorneys, George
A. Knight and Frank McGowan, while ai
another table sat Chief Lees, Detective
McVey of Dover, District Attorney llos
jner and Attorney Chamberlain. The de
fendant appeared to be sumewhat disap
pointed because no order was made for
her release, while Chief Lees, Mr. Hos
mer and Detective McVey did not attempt
to conceal their chajjrin at the turn of
affairs. The opinion, consisting of nearly
5000 words, was written by Judge Cook,
and concurred in by all his associates. In
substance it is as follows:
The facts in this case are few. The prisoner
Is held under a waixant issued by the Governor
of the Stale of California for her arrest and
surrender to the State of Delaware. i?he
stands charged with the crime of murder, al
leged to have been committed in the State of
Delaware, and has been arrested as "a fugi
tive from Justice. The warrant Under which
she is held fails to find that she is a fugitive
from Justice and it is admitted by all parties
as well as shown by the documents annexed to
the Governor's warrant that she was not cor
porally In the State of Delaware at the time
the alleged orinie was committed and has not
been there since, in met that she was never
corporally within the boundaries or jurisdlc
tr:at .State. The documents annexed to
the Governor's warrant show that the prisoner
Is chaigni With having, while in California,
cent by the United States mail to Delaware
a. b>x â¢>:' poisoned candy, which was. partaken
of by the person In Delaware to whom It was
Bent, causing the death in that State of such
person. If these allegations be true, a most
v been committed, one de
serving the greatest punishment known to the
Jaw, and if a iegal way could be found to
send the prisoner to her trial there it should
be done. The court has labored earnestly to
find a way, but without avail. Tne prisoner,
like all citizens, has certain rights, which have
been preserved to her by our constitution,
which cannot be violated.
When the Government of the United States
was formed the framers of its constitution as
well as the framers of the articles of confed
eration which preceded it. made certain pro
visions lor the surrendering of criminals by
one State to another. The articles of con
federation, the constitution, the statute passed
â  .igresÃ to carry the constitutional pro
visions Into effect, and the statute of this
State passed to aid In carrying them into ef
fect, all provide for interstate rendition of
"fugitive from Justice," but the provisions of
each are specific and positive.
In the articles of confederation we find the
following language used:
better to secure and perpetuate mutual
.friendship and intercourse among the people
of the different States ln~this Union, the free
inhabitants of each of these States, paupers,
vagabonds and fugitives from justice excepted,
shall be entitled to all the privileges and im
munities of free citizens in the several States.
â¢ â¢ " If any person guilty of or charged
â¢with treason, felony or other high misdemean
or in any State shall flee from justice and be
found in any of the United States he shall upon
the demand of the Governor or executive power
of the State from which he f!e<l be delivered up
and removed to the State having jurisdiction
of his offense." â Article 4, articles of confeder-
atii'n.
In the Federal constitution the language is as
follows:
"A person chared in any State with treason,
felony or other crime, who shall flee from
justice and be found in another State, snail.
on demand of the executive authority of the
State from which he fled, be delivered up to
be removed to the .State having Jurisdiction of
the crime." â Article IV, section 2, constitution
of the United States.
The United States Revised K/atutes on the
subject reads: "'Whenever the executive of any
State or Territory demands any person sr a
fugitive from Justice of the executive authoriti
es any State or Territory to which such per
son has fled, and produces a copy of an indict
ment found, or an affidavit made Before a
magistrate of any State or Territory charging
the person demanded with having committed
treason, felony or other crime, certified as au
thentic by the Governor or chief magistrate of
the State or Territory from whence the person
so charged has fled, it shall be the duty of the
executive authority of the State or Territory- to
which such person has fled to cause him to be
arrested and secured and to cause notice of the
arrest to be given to the executive authority
making such demand or to the agent, etc."â
Section 5275, Keviaed Statutes of the United
States.
And the State statute, which follows almost
verbatum the constitution of the United States,
Is In the following language:
"A person charged In any State of the United
States with treason, felony or other crimes
â¢who flees from Justice and is found in this

Cured By
The most effective skin purifying and
beautifying soap in the world, as well as
purest and sweetest for toilet, bath, and
nursery.
It is the only preventive of pimples,
blackheads, red, rough, and oily skin, red,
rough hands with shapeless nails, dry,
thin, and falling hair, and simple baby
blemishes. It is so because it strikes at
the cause of most complexional disfigura-
tions, viz., the Clogged, Irritated,
Inflamed, Overworked, ok Sluggish
Pore. . â¢
I suffered two years with Acne. I have tried
all kinds of medicines but they did me no good
I have used nine cakes of your Soap, and I am
cured. My skin is as smooth as any baby.

Before using Cctiouka Soap, my face and
hands were just as rough as they could be and
my face was all covered with pimples. I was
unfit to look at, but after using Cdticura
Soap three weeks my face was equal to velvet.
Feb. 6, 1898. PAUL DUPRE, Chaler, La.
I suffered with blackheads and pimples for
two or three years until it became chronic. I
tried everything imaginable, but it did me no

I If the word "flee" and the words "from
i which he has fled" were eliminated from the
provisions of the statutes and constitutional
article referred to. a qualification would be
taken which appears to have been Inserted ex
lndustrta. lor If respondent's interpretation
; were adoptt-il such words would be meanlng
i lest*. We have no more right to eliminate th"t:e
; words than we would bave to Insert words, and
by so doing we would enlarge the terms of the
constltuttion as well as the statutes in ques
tion.
It is true, as stated by the District Attorney,
that modern mail facilities make crimes pos
1 sit.'le without the actual presence of the crimi
j nal. Congress has already seen this, and has,
to fi.ime crimes, acted. The constitution of
Inked States gives Congress the exclusive
1 of the mails, and the undisputed right
to detlne what ."hall be an unlawful use therof.
and to make such unlawful use criminal, with
such penalty as It shall lix, even to a death
penalty.
A great crime may, In the absence of such
a statute as we have in this Htat--. viz., section
27 of the Penal Code, go unpunished, but bet
ter that, than that the courts should attempt
to usurp a power of government not delegated
to them. Aside from these reasons and the fact
th&t the pecple never have adopted, and un
questionably never would adopt, a law. con
stitutional or statutory, which would permit
them, merely because a criminal charge was
made against them In a sister State, to be
taken from home and friends and into such
State (which is the construction that the 1 dis
trict Attorney asks us to put upon the law), i
the question has been fully and absolutely set
tled by the highest court in the land, and all
the industry' of counsel has failed to produce
one single case in which any court has ruled i
as they contend, while a score or more have
ruled adversely to their contention. The rase :
referred to is that of ex parte Keggle, 114 V. B.
642. In which Justice Harlan uses this lan
ruage:
"The only question remaining to be consid
ered relates to the alleged want of competent
evidence before the Governor of Utah, at the
time he issued the warrant of arrest, to prove '
that the appellant was a fugitive from the
justice of Pennsylvania. Undoubtedly, the act j
of Congress did not Impose upon the executive
authority of the Territory the duty of surren
dering the appellant, unless it was made to :
appear, in some proper way, that he was a
tugitive from justice. In other words the ap
pellant was entitled, under the act of Congress, I
to insist upon proof that he was within the
demanding State at the time he is alleged to
have committed the crime charged, and sub
sequently withdrew from her Jurisdiction, so i
that he could not be reached by her criminal
process. The statute, it is to be observed, does i
not prescribe the character of such proof; but
that the executive authority of the Territory !
was not required by the act of Congress to
cause the arrest of appellant and his delivery
to the agent appointed by the Governor of i
Pennsylvania, without proof of the fact that !
he was n fugitive from justice. Is. in our judg
ment, clear from the language from that act
Any other Interpretation would lead to the con
clusion that the mere requisition by the exec
utive of the demanding State, accompani. .1 by
the copy of an indictment, or an affidavit be
fore a magistrate, certified by him to be au
thentic, charging the accused with a crime i
committed within her limits. Imposes upon the
executive of the State or Territory where the I
accused Is found the duty of surrendering htm '
although he may be satisfied, from lncontest- ;
able proof, that the accused had in fact never I
been In the demanding State, and. therefore
could not be said to have fled from Its Jus
tice."
Many other cases could be cited to the same
effect, among thorn, in re Oreenough 31 Vt

The District Attorney finds support for his !
contention only In a dissenting opinion filed
in the case of State vs. Hall, 11." X c i""
S. E. Rep.. 732). The reneonlng of such dls- I
anting opinion is to our minds an absurdity |
and the opinion is supported by no sound rea
son.
The decisions all taken together with their
various shadings amount to the establishment
of this rule, 1. c.. that he who was actually in i
a Str.te at the time any act tending to the 1
ultimate completion of a crime was done or who I
at any time after the completion of a crime
has entered the State and left, whether vol
untarily or involuntarily, may be returned to j
it for trial. But where he never has been
within reach of the process of a State since the
crime or some portion of it was committed,
he cannot be sent there.
Any other construction than this would sub
ject every citizen, guilty or innocent, to the
possibility of being removed from the State of
his residence to a distant State upon the mere
filing of a complaint In such other State charg
ing a crime. All citizens would be at the mercy
of their enemies, for under the constitution as
well as the statute of this State, which is sub
stantially the same language as the constitu- '
tfon, it would be the duty of the Governor
upon It belne shown to him that a criminal
charge had been made, to order the arrÂ»st and :
removal of the person charged, for it has al
ways been hr-l.i that the question of guilt or I
Innocence cannot be Inquired into. Such a re
sult was never contemplated, either by the
framers of the constitution. Congress or the
Legislature of this State, therefore, words were
added which made proof that the person
charged had at some time been within roach
of the Jurisdiction of the demanding PtatÂ«
necessary before the liberty of the citizen
could be disturbed.
At the conclusion of the reading 1 Judge !
Cook said: "It still remains to be deter- j
mined whether Mrs. Botkin can be tried
under section 27 of the Penal Code of this
State." Turning to the counsel he asked
them to agree upon a date for arguing i
that point.
District Attorney Hosmer asked that !
the prisoner be formally charged with i
murder and the evidence In the case be '
presented to the Grand Jury for its con
sideration.
Attorney Knight said he was not pre
pared to argue the matter of the court's
jurisdiction in the premises.
Hosmer demanded that a day bo set
for the argument, and Knight said he
would waive all technicalities. He asked
that an order be made by the court re
manding the prisoner to the custody of
Chief Lees.
Judge Seawell said such an order might
entangle the case, for If it were entered j
on the record it might make it appear |
that the writ of habeas corpus had been
denied and a writ of extradition granted, i
Both counsel and court were at a loss I
how to proceed, but Judge Cook, without '
making any order that might appear on
the record, and refusing to make any
final order In the matter of the habeas
corpus, and with the consent of both
sides, continued the case until Saturday,
instructing the prosecution to take such
action in the meantime as It saw fit â
either to lay the matter before the Grand
Jury or to proceed on information and
take the matter into the Police Court.
Chief Lees and the District Attorney I
were anything but pleased at the out- I
come, and the Chief, after court ad
journed, declared the case would never
go before the Police Court If he could
prevent it. He said the evidence would
probably be presented to the Grand Jury |
at its next sc-sslon.
Attorney Knight stated that he would
place no obstacles in the way of the
prosecution bringing the matter to trial
here, but was satisfied to let the prose
cution proceed either before the Grand i
Jury or the Police Court.
MRS. BOTKIN IS BOSS.

Mrs. Botkin seems to be enjoying all
the comforts of home in the City Prison.
She is confined in the matron's room, and
refuses to associate with the other women
who are temporarily confined there.
Several nights ago an infant whose
mother had been arrested for drunken

ASPHYXIATED BY GAS.
Emmett Gray Lost His Life oy Rea
son of Defective Gas Fix
tures.
Emmett Gray, lumber Inspector for
Grace & Co., was found dend in his bed
yesterday morning at his residence. 2718
California street. He had been asphyx
iated by illuminating gas flowing from a
loose stopcock on the gas fixtures. It was
so loose It could be turned completely
around In a circle.
Mr. Gray returned from a business trip
to Fort Bragg last Sunday afternoon and
retired early. Th> servant found him dead
md cold at half-past 7 in the morning,
evhen he called him for his breakfast.
Prior to his employment by Grace & Co.
Mr Gray had for twenty-six years been
:ide observer at Sausallto for the Govern

Besides his widow the deceased left two
daughters. 16 and 12 years old. He was
I native of Mississippi. 65 years old.
A SERIES OF FIGHTS
THAT WERE FAILURES
THE FIRST SHOW OF THE BOHE-
MIAN CLUB A FIZZLE.
Jack McMahon Was Pushed Down
and Out by Eugene Mulligan in
the Second Round.
Of the many "scrub" fights managed by
so-called boxing clubs in this city, the en
tertainment held last evening in B. B.
Hall, 121 Eddy street, under the auspices
of the "Bohemian" Athletic Club, was
about as bad as any lover of sport could
imagine.
Jack O'Kane and Charles Vickers fought
six rounds, but in the middle of the sixth
the police took a hand in the game and
stopped the show. It was a slogging
match pure and simple and Sergeant Mar
tin called it a draw, but the contestants
were not satisfied with the sergeant's
Judgment and asked Referee Billy Otts
to decide the contest. Otts said "draw,"
but after he had had a talk with O'Kane's
seconds he declared the match in favor
of O'Kane, much to the chagrin of the
friends of Vickers.
Charley Johnson and Billy Otts were
booked to fight six rounds, but "the phy
sician," who. It was stated, had examined
the men, said Otts was not in condition
to box and the match was therefore de
clared off.
"Kid" Wiley and Joe Howard boxed
three rounds.
The event of the evening had all the ap
pearance of a prearranged affair. It was
to have been an eight-round bout between
Eugene Mulligan and Jack McMahon, but
the last-named fighter was pushed down
four times and the last time down he re
mained on all fours for ten seconds, but
after the referee had counted the ninth
second one of McMahon's seconds threw
up a sponge, which signified defeat for his
man. McMahon made some pretense at
being angry and said he was cheated out
of the contest. He certainly lost the
contest by falling repeatedly without hav
ing received a blow and the referee had
the authority to give the fight against
him if he had so desired on these grounds.
In the paris mutuels there was a heavy
play on Mulligan winning the contest In
from one to three rounds and scarcely
any money was wagered from three to
eight, proving. conclusively that some
thing was "doing" by those who had the
combination.
â  â¦ â 
Charged With Abduction.
A warrant was sworn out in Judge Con
lan's court yesterday for the arrest of
Frank Nesbitt, a young man not unknown
to the police, on a charge of abduction.
During the Native Sons' celebration at
San Jose he met Susie Hilton, a girl 18
years of age, and represented to her
parents that he had procured a situation
for her. He brought her to this city and
has since been living with her in a house
on Fourth street. The girl's parents
came to the city yesterday and swore to
the warrant for Nesbitt's arrest.
WELLS, FARGO & CO.
FORCED TO PAY THE TAX.
WELLS, FARGO & CO. has surrendered to the Inevitable. The Call's
fi^ht for the people has been won and those who have packages to send
can now do so without attaching the revenue stamp.
E. S. Plllsbury, attorney for the company, notified George D. Squires, at
torney for Costley, the plaintiff In the case of Costley vs. The Wells-Fargo
Express Company, to send a bill of costs, damages and judgment, and when
this was done It was accepted and Mr. Squires was told that a check for the
amount would be sent to him this rnornlnjj.
This virtually ends the contention of the company tTTat the stamps called
for by the war tax are to be furnt3hed by the senders of packages and now
the corporation will pay its share of the burden. In this case the decision
of the Superior Court was final and as there Is no appeal from this court in
cases from Justices' courts the company had no alternative but to pay.
While the company may make a bluff that this case will not be taken as a
precedent for future action. It is not probable that It will risk another suit
and those who have packages to send may offer them without stamps with
the assurance that they will reach their destination.
The case was fought through on Its merits, and the company was beaten
on every point in both courts, and while the company may try to Induce its
customers to pay the tax the courts will hold this case a? a precedent and any
one whose package is refused will have no trouble in getting damages on v
suit.
The Call began the fight against the express company feeling assured
that the courts would sustain Its opinion and the results of this trial bear
out fully Its position. It was a fight for the people and the people have
won, and henceforth the Wells-Fargo Express Company will do, under com
pulsion, that which It should have done from the beginningâ pay ItÃ share of
the money necessary to meet the expense of carrying on the war with
Spain.
PURLOINED THE
DIAMOND AND
DISAPPEARED
Bold Theft of a Valu
able Stud.
DETECTIVES ARE AT WORK
JEWELER VAN VLIET ROBBEI
BY A CLEVER CROOK.
The Gem Taken by a Boy Who Was
Supposed to Be in Collusion
With the Chief Con
spirator.
The police are investigating a peculiar
diamond robbery committed yesterday
afternoon In Julius Van Vliet's Jewelry
store at 752 Market street
Shortly after noon a well-dressed man
visited the store and asked to see m me
diamond studs. A tray containing a num
ber of precious gems was placed be
fore him, and after selecting the most
valuable of the lot he promised to return
and pay for it. The clerk wrapped up
the diamond and placed it on the counter,
expecting that the stranger would return
in a few moments.
A short time afterward a poorly clad
boy entered the store and pretended to
be looking at some watches which were
in the show case. He remained only a few
seconds and then left.
The clerk, whose attention was dis
tracted for a moment, went to get the
stud and to his surprise he found it was
gone.
He immediately rushed into the street,
expecting to find the boy, but he was not
to be found. The supposition is that the
prospective buyer of the diamond em
ployed the ragged urchin to steal the
stud.
Immediately after the loss of the dia
mond was discovered the proprietor of the
store telephoned to police headquarters
for a detective. Captain Bohen sent two
of his men to make an investigation, but
up to a late hour last night they had not
succeeded in finding the boy or the dia
mond.
While the detectives were searching for
the theif who stole the stud, a well
dressed, middle-aged woman visited the
office of the Chief of Police and com
plained that she had been robbed of a
diamond ring which she values at $200.
Her name is Mrs. Dletel, and she lives
at 1223 Geary street.
Yesterday afternoon a man visited her
house on the pretext that he was anx
ious to see her husband. While speak
ing to him she foolishly informed him
that she kept her diamond in a vase
which was on the mantel shelf. At that
moment a peddler rang the door bell and
Mrs. Deitel temporarily left the stranger.
During her absence he stole her diamond
ring, which was in the vase, and at once
left the house.
Some time afterward a friend of Mrs.
Deitel informed her that the thief had
sold the ring for $20 to a pawnbroker on
Grant avenue. She visited the place, but
the proprietor denied that he had bought
it To-day Mrs. Deitel intends to pro
cure a search warrant for the recovery
of her ring. A description of the thief
has been furnished the police, and every
effort will be made to run him down.
A Match for Lavigne.
Kid Lavigne, the world's famous light
weight, who has been matched to fight
Tom Tracy before the National Athletic
Club some time next month, arrived in
town yesterday morning. Messrs. Groom
and Gibb, the fight promoters, were look
ing for him all day, but were unable to
find him, and it is thought that some
other club has been trying to get the
match, but the National considers Jt a
sure thing.
A WOMAN'S
BODY AFLOAT
IN THE BAY
Passed Close to the
Philadelphia.
SEEN FROM THE BAY CITY

THELII* IN COLLISION.
Eva Hess, the Girl Who P*an Away
From Home Some Weeks Ago,
Returned Yesterday on.
the Walla Walla.
The crew of the cruiser Philadelphia
and the passengers un the 10:30 a. m.
trip of the ferry steamer Bay City wit
nessed a grewsome sight yesterday. The
remains of a woman floated past the war
ship and the ferry-boat had to be stopped
in order to prevent running- over It. The
body floated face upward, but the feat
ures were not recognizable, as the wo
man's hair had broken loose from Its fast
oninps and it was only occasionally, when
the wash of the waves removed the hair,
that the face could be seen. The hody
was well clothed and did not seem to
have been long in the bay.
The men on the Philadelphia were the
first to see the corpse. They asked per
mission to lower a boat and tow It to the
Folsom-street slip, but the officer of the
deck would not give his consent. It
would not have taken fifteen minutes to
secure the remains and clear up the mys
tery, but discipline had to be maintained.
The Jiay City was on her way to Oak
land, and being a little behind time on ac
count of the fog, Captain L^ale was very
anxious to make a quick passage. When
he saw the body it was considerably to
the north of the Philadelphia, and right
in the track of his vessel. In order to
avoid running over it he had to slow
down his vessel and change her course.
Directly the Bay City got back to this
side Captain Leale went to John Carter
and George Engels, the boatmen at Clay
street, and told them about where the
body should be. They got out their
whitehalls and made a thorough search of
the bay from off Clay street to Alcatraz
and Angel Island. They\ informed Captain
Stofen of the Government steamer Mc-
Dowell and he kept a bright lookout for
the remains on his trip to Lime Point,
but the body was not seen again.
It may have been carried out
to sea, and again it may be
stranded somewhere on the Marin
shore. It may have been the remains of
Mrs. Miller, who is supposed to have
jumped overboard from the steamer
Piedmont last Saturday night, and again
it may have been some woman whose
disappearance has not yet been recorded.
The fog came in as a surprise yester
day morning. It had been thick enough
to cut outside all night, and early In the
morning a big piece seemed to break off
and make for the bay. For a time noth
ing could be seen, and the red stack tugs
could not find the ship Galena, which
was at anchor in Richardsons Bay. The
men on the steamer could hear the men
on the ship calling to them, but could
not locate the sound, and had to come
back to San Francisco without their tow.
The fog disappeared almost as quickly
as It came up. Like a great ball It rolled
along the front and finally disappeared
over Baden.
The collier Wellington 'was delayed out
side by fog and when she did get in near
ly sank the schooner Jennie Thelin while
docking. The Thelin was anchored right
In the fairway, so no blame can attach
to the captain of the Wellington. The
collier struck the schooner a glancing
blow and started a few planks. Later
the Thelln set sail and got out of her
dangerous position.
J P. Donovan, a brother-in-law of Chief
of Detectives Bohen, has been appointed
a special policeman on the water front
by the Harbor Commissioners. He takes
the place of R. Cords, resigned.
The transport Pennsylvania came over
from the Union Iron Works yesterday
and docked at the seawall. The Ohio,
Indiana and Pennsylvania are all together
now and will sail for Manila In company.
The crews of the Philadelphia and
Wheeling are to be paid off to-day, and
then a few of them will be given shore
liberty. After that the warships will go
to Mare Island. The apprentice boys and
the crew of the Adams will be paid off
next Saturday. The armament for the
sloop-of-war Is daily expected, and as
soon as it is in place the Adams will
sail for Samoa.
The British ship Belford was placed
on the California arydock yesterday. The
dock hands say she is the dirtiest vessel
they have ever seen. Barnacles, grass
and dirt, gathered in every sea on the
face of the earth during the past three
years, cover the bottom several feet thick.
It Is no wonder the Belford was 91
days coming here from Newcastle, N.

her home at Los Banos.

THEY ABE NOW CHARGED WITH

Claimed to Have Swindled the City
Out of 360,000 Feet of Lumber,

$5000.
The Grand Jury made a report to Judge
Belcher at 11 o'clock last night, Indict
ing School Director Thomas A. Burns,
Building Inspector O'Brien and Contrac
tor P. Swift for felony. The charge is
that they conspired together to defraud
the city out of 360,000 feet of lumber of a
value of 15000. It is alleged that bills
were presented for over one million feet,
whereas Swift only delivered 640.740 feet.'
The transactions took place between June i
18, 1897, and January 31, 1898.
When the jury appeared before Judge
Belcher the foreman asked that In view I
of the public interest manifested in the |
cases the names of the persons Indicted j
be given to the press. The Judge stated '
that this should be done. Bonds for each j
of the accused persons were fixed at $5000
and bench warrants were ordered issued.

Thursday apparently having had an effect:
HOLY CROSS FAIR
NEARING A CLOSE
EHE PUBLIC IS OVERLOOKING
AN ATTRACTION.
A Programme of Instrumental and
Vocal Music Rendered Night
ly â Names of Those
Who Participate.
Although the ladies in charge of the
various booths at the Holy Cross fair at
Native Sons' Hall are exerting every ef
fort to make it a success by accomplish
ing the object in view of benefiting the
parish by raising sufficient funds to pay
off a fraction of the church debt, they are
not met ting with the success which is due
Jhem.
Notwithstanding the fact that this
bazaar is probably one of the best, i* not
*the best, of the many now in progress, it
seems to have been overlooked by those
who have visited and evidently enjoyed
some of the poorest.
From an artistic point of view it is per
fect, and from that point of view which
has for its object a good compensation
for the money expended, it is unequaled.
The current impression that to go to a
church fair is equivalent to going to some
gambling house, with less prospect of get
ting a fair return for money expended, is
a thing of the past, and is, as Fatner
Yorke says,' "the philosophy of the man
who stands on the opposite side of the
street and watches the crowds of people
as they pass through the entrance to be
entertained and not 'fleeced.' "
An exemplification of the truth of
Father Yorke's remark, which Is now
being shown the public at the Holy Cross
fair, Is meeting with approval and a lib
eral support. The old method of attempt
ing to coerce people into buying what they
don't want is entirely forsaken, being
supplanted by a system which gives like
for like and an enjoyable entertainment
besides. The booths. are there simply for
the purpose of raffling or selling outright
articles which, as far as value is con
cerned, are worth more than the price
paid or obtained for them. These articles
have been presented by charitable people
and are being sold for charity and not ior
the purpose, as many suppose, of making
about five times their value.
It is thought, by some of the parish that
the politicians of the city who are so anx
ious Just at present to pursue a course of
conciliation would be wise were they to
attend a fair, where they receive the
good will of the -people who exert an in
fluence over a portion of the city valu
able from a voting standpoint.
: Such a thing as a crowd of ticket sell
ers surrounding a person as they enter
is out of the question. This has been ab
solutely prohibited, and, as a result, a
good attendance should be insured for
each evening. : -^-. â ;â¢â¢ Â«.__-;,
The main - attraction Is afforded In the
nightly entertainment which includes in
the programme rendered many selections
by. both prominent amateur and profes
sional singers and merry-makers. Last
evening it was the Native Sons' booth to
afford the entertainment and procure in
teresting and enjoyable 1 talent. Mrs.
Frank Dunn and Mrs. C. F. Kapp, the
managers of the booth, arranged a per
fect programme, consisting of instru
mental and vocal music and comedy
sketches.
Among the many who made the enter
ment a success are the following: Miss
Grace Sherry, who rendered a soprano
solo; Jack Cathcart. who made all Kinds
of fun with his specialties, and Mrs. Wil
liam Kennedy, who also rendered a
soprano solo.
The ladies of the Sacred Heart booth
will entertain this evening. O'Connor and
Kelleher, the clever and well-known dan
cers, have volunteered to give an exhi
bition of Jig dancing, which will const!-, |
tute one of the many features of the pro- ;
gramme. 'â ' â ',''â  , j
One of the most successful ventures of >
the fair is the lunch which is provided ;
daily for business men between the hours |
of 11 and 2. *i was found necessary, :
owing to the increasing, attendance, to
provide additional accommodations. The A ;
regular price for the meal is 25 cents, and !
the food presented is even better than
that afforded by the most popular of
downtown restaurants. The management
announce a special menu for the lunch
next Saturday. -- â Â
The fair will continue until next Mon
day night, when it will be concluded with
a farewell address and a grand entertain
ment. - , ' '
