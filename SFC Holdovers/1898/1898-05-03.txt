AMERICA'S GLORIOUS VICTORY IN THE HARBOR OF MANILA
CHICAGO, May 3.-A special to the
Record from Washington says: The
President received the news of the cap
ture of Manila last night from the Brit
ish embassy.
Sir Julian Pauncefote tried all day
to get into communication with the
British authorities at Hongkong and the
Consul at Manila, without success un
til evening, when he received a cable
gram announcing that the city had
surrendered, but giving no details. A
copy was at once made and sent to
the White House by an attache.

DEWEY'S FLEETS
SHELLING FORTS
ON CORREGIDOR
Copyrighted. IS9S. by James Gordon Bennett.
HONGKONG, May 2. â 2:45 p. m. â A telegram has been received
here saying that the American ships are bombarding Corregidor, an
island in the harbor of Manila.
There is no news of the Spanish squadron, but according to the lat
est advices it could not take the oifensive in any case. The cable to Ma
nila is now interrupted.
The steamer Esmeralda, chartered by the banking companies here to
bring away specie from Manila, reached there, and it is believed that she
has been Boarded by the Americans.
MADRID, May 2. â After he had beaten the Spanish ships Dewey
sent an ultimatum to Captain-General Augusti, demanding all the stores
and coal and the surrender of every Spanish ship, and giving twenty
four hours to comply. It is believed the Government has cabled Augusti
to comply.
It is said here that American petroleum bombs set fire to a number
of native huts at Manila during the engagement.
Twenty minutes later the
Olympia again signaled the
other American ships to draw
in at close quarters, and once
mere rapid and incessant
cannonading began.
This terrific bombardment
soon ended the fight. One
after another the Spanish ves
sels were silenced, and three
of them caught fire, including
Admiral Montijo's flagship,
the Reina Maria Cristina,
from an explosion caused by
a shell from one of our ves
sels. The admiral at once
transferred his flag to the Isla
de Cuba.
One Spanish vessel

was sunk and several
were run ashore to
escape capture.
Commodore Dewey's at
tention was now directed to
the land batteries, which he
silenced after a brief and en
ergetic bombardment.
The battle lasted an hour
and a half, and it was a great
and terrible spectacle. The
Spaniards fought bravely
against superior force and
suffered heavy losses.
Four hundred Span
iards are reported
killed, including two
commanders.
Their losses by fire are also
probably very great j The
Spaniards would not giv,e in,
and when the American- fleet
returned to Cavite some shots
were still fired from thelforts

The American ships jwere
apparently uninjured. Com

well carried out. The; ma

"Senor Aguilera, the civil governor of Madrid, has just posted on
the walls of the Home Office the customary proclamation intimating that
the civil authorities consider the circumstances justify the handing over
to the military authorities the mission of keeping order.
"Lieutenant-General Daban, captain-general of Madrid, has assumed
charge and the first military patrols have just appeared in the Puerto

MADBID, May 3.-2 a. m.â The mob to-night tried to break into
the Apollo Theater and hold a manifestation. The police prevented the
attempt being successful, but the crowd broke all the windows before
they were dispersed.
Immediately after the declaration of martial law a large number of
police and civil guards occupied the principal streets. The Puerto del Sol
is held by a squadron of the Princess Hussars, while the Pava Hussars,
dismounted, are in the Pontejas square near the telegraph office.
The Princess Hussars are a fine sight, their white uniforms gieam

KEY WEST, Fla., May 2.â Miss Clara Barton and her associates
of the Red Cross are still aboard the relief ship State of Texas which
is likely to remain here for ten days at least. Miss Barton has pre
pared a letter to Captain General Blanco which she will submit to Ad
miral Sampson and the State Department at Washington. Should it
be approve! 'Ie will send it to the Captain General of Cuba under a
flag of peaceful entry into Matanzas or some other Cuban port.
Miss Barton's letter is as follows:
"In the name of the Red Cross, which represents the cause of suf
fering humanity, without difference of nation or creedâ that cross
which for Spaniard and American alike is the symbol of tire Savior who
died for all mankindâ l appeal to you to permit me to distribute the
provisions now on the Red Cross steamer State of Texas among the
starving reconcentrados of Cuba.
"Prompt distribution of these provisions may save the lives of
thousands whose death would be of no consequence, from a military
standpoint, to either side, in this unhappy conflict. There are, how
ever, lives precious in the eyes of Him, who, according to His sacred
word, views none wit., indifference, even the fall of the sparrow. Let
the war go on with its dreadful work, but permit the Red Cross to help

FUTURE OF
PHILIPPINES
CONSIDERED
The United States
May Have to Hold
the Islands.
NEW YORK, May 2.â The Her
ald's Washington correspondent
sends the following: Commodore
Dewey's victory in the harbor of
Manila has given the Government
of the United States a difficult
problem to solve. Spain's power
in the Philippines has been broken.
Her only foothold in the Pacific
has been wrested from her. The
United States is responsible for
the future of the Philippines, and
the question which will have to be
met is, What is to be done with
them?
Are they to be restored to
Spain? Are they to be held per- 1
manently by the United States?
Are they to be turned over to
some European power?
These are questions which offi
cials of the administration and
Senators and Representatives are
asking each other to-day. Their
restoration to Spain is regarded as
out of tiie question, even though a
large war indemnity might be paid
for them. Spain's power in the
Philippines having once been
broken and her navy having been
destroyed, it is doubtful if, under
any circumstances, she could again
establish her authority over the
rebellious inhabitants of the isl
ands. The United States, it is
held, could not turn the Philip
pines back to Spain with the
knowledge that by this act a con
dition of savage warfare even more
atrocious than that waged in Cuba
was to follow.
No one believes that the islands
will be restored to Spain, and yet
if this cannot be dene the situation
becomes all the more difficult. If
the United States holds the islands
this Government also becomes a
factor in all controversies of the
Orient. Men in public life here
are averse to this, if it can be
avoided. They believe the United
States should confine its posses
sions to this hemisphere and that
even the annexation of the Ha
waiian Islands is a .matter of ques
tionable policy.
The retention of the Philippines,
they say, means that the United
States is to become a world power
and is to have a voice in the af
fairs not oniy of this continent but
of the world at large. A military
force would have to be maintained
in the islands. The fortiftcations
of Manila, destroyed by x Commo
dore Dewey's guns, would have to
be rebuilt and strengthened, and
the Pacific fleet of the United States
would have to be made even more
powerful than that maintained in
the Atlantic-
Should the islands be transferred
to any other power, fresh compli
cations would arise. They could
not be given to Japan without in
curring the disfavor of Russia, at
least, and probably of other Euro
pean powers. They could not be
transferred to Great Britain or any
other European power without
bringing about complications of the
gravest character, and, perhaps,
endangering a general European
war.
The Government may be compelled
to hold on to the islands in the inter
ests of the peace of the world. What
ever may finally be done, the islands
must be held until the end of the war,
and in the meantime obligations rest
upon the United States which cannot
be avoided. Order must be main
tained. The natives cannot be allowed
to wreak vengeance on the Spanish
residents when the Government of
Spain is no longer able to afford them
protection. Whether Commodore
Dewey, with the force at his disposal,
will be able to enforce order, is a
question which is causing some anx
iety here. He had in his squadron
nearly two thousand men. How many
of these have been killed and wound
ed is not known. He will have to re
tain enough men on his ships to keep
them ready for action, and i*. is not
probable that he could land, even
temporarily, more than 1000 or 1200
men. As the natives are favorably
disposed toward the United States,
the task of controlling them may not
be as difficult as is feared. Senor
Quesada, the Cuban representative
here, received a letter from one of the
leaders of the insurrection some
months ago saying they wanted a
United States protectorate in the
islands.
Commodore Dewey's defeat of the
Spanish will give him prestige
among the insurgents that will tend
to give authority to his small force.
The Spanish force. in the Philippines
is understood to be about 5000 men,
and it may be necessary to reinforce
Commodore Dewey's command by
sending him some soldiers.
There has been some talk to-day
about dispatching several transports
to the islands with a considerable
force of men, but nothing definite
will be determined as to this until
complete special reports as to the con
ditions existing and the necessities
of the situation have been received.
There is little doubt that the cruiser
Charleston will be sent to Manila as
soon as she is put into commission,
which will probably be within a few
days if the necessary men can be
found to man her.
Among members of the Senate
Committee on Foreign Relations and
the House Committee on Foreign Af
fairs there is a disposition at present
not to discuss the probable future of
the islands, because it is a matter
with which they will possibly have to
deal, but which they have up to the
present time considered only super
ficially.
Senator Lodge said to me to-day
that he thought it would be a good
thing for the United States to keep the
islands, for the present, at any rate.
He did not see that the European
powers would have any right to ob
ject, even if we should determine to
keep them permanently. Some other
members of the committee believe the
best course might be to turn the
islands over to some European power
in return for a monetary or other
suitable compensation, retaining a
coaling station, however, for use in
emergencies.
Representative Williams of Mis
sissippi, one of the members of the
House committee, said this evening
he did not think the United States
wanted to retain the islands. He
thought they might be sold to some
European nation, probably Great
Britain, for enough to materially aid
in paying the expenses of the war.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, May 2.â The Madrid cor
respondent of the Standard says:
"Considerable surprise and disappoint
ment has been caused by the destruc
tion caused by the American lleet, as it
had been officially stated that the au
thorities at Manila had received sixty
torpedoes and heavy guns to strength
en the coast defenses, particularly the
two channels on the right and left of
Corregidor Island. It is noticeable
among all classes, especially among
politicians, that there is a strong hope
of an intervention by continental pow
ers, especially Germany and Russia,"
Little additional news has arrived
from Manila, but the cardinal fact is
that Commodore Dewey is now in pos
session of Manila Bay and can cer
tainly take possession of Corregidor
Island, even if he finds difficulty in ef
fectually capturing Manila itself, ow
ing to the absence of a necessary land
ing force. Thus, having secured a na
val base, he will have no difficulty in
securing supplies of coal.
As the Times remarks to-day:
"There is a mere question of money
and organization. Tt â¢ belligerent who
is strong in certain waters will gener
ally be able to obtain coal. To de
clare coal contraband is no obstruc
tion to private enterprise if the risks of
transport are moderate and the pecu
niary inducements sufficient."
The Madrid correspondent of the
Daily Mail says: "It is suggested that
the half-breeds at the Manila arsenal,
who are rebels at heart, cut the cables
connecting with the submarine mines
and thus enabled Commodore Dewey
to force the harbor in safety."
No real bombardment will be neces
sary to destroy Manila, if the shells are
of such a description as will set houses
on fire, the bulk of which there are
built of wood and bamboo. Only the
public buildings are built of stone,
while the brick built old town is inca
pable 01 resisting artillery.
Captain Cadarzo, of the cruiser
Reina Maria Cristina, who was kill
ed on the bridge of his vessel, was one
of the most brilliant officers in the
Spanish navy.. His ship was a model of
order and efficiency. He read and wrote
a great deal, especially with reference
to naval and colonial matters, and he
was so outspoken that he often came
into collision with the authorities.
It appeared that Admiral Montijo
was taken altogether by surprise and
the Spanish authorities generally were
in a state of utter unreadiness. The
forts were not completed, the harbor
was not mined, there were no search
lights, and the American squadron was
sighted only after it had already pass
ed the outer and principal forts.
On every side in England Is heard
praise of the skill and daring displayed
by Commodore Dewey in a situation
where, if anything miscarried, he would
have been caught in a most desperate
position. At the same time credit is
given Admiral Montijo, who had a
wretched fleet and stood no chance ex
cept from the assistance he might re
ceive from the forts.
The American vessels, however, by
moving to and fro, were easily able to
avoid the badly directed fire from the
forts and, looking to all the circum
stances, it is apparent that the Ameri
can fleet could have received but slight
damage.
The moral influence of the first great
victory is incalculable, and although it
is practically certain that Spain will
not yield until she had tried conclusions
in the Atlantic, where she hopes fur
better luck with her really first-class
fighting squadron, it is believed that a
similar victory in Cuban waters would
produce signs of revolution in Spain,
compelling an endeavor to come to
terms.
The Times says: "The measures ad
vised by the United States naval stra
tegic board seem well conceived to meet
any possible emergency."
The sending of three German men
of-war to the Philippines is much criti
cized.
PORTS OF CHINA AND
JAPAN YET OPEN.
Evidence of a Friendly Disposition
That Will Give Our Vessels a
Chance to Coal.
WASHINGTON, May 2.â lt turns out
that while Japan has given notice that
she will declare neutrality, a decree of
neutrality is not yet actually issued,
so that Yokohama and other advan
tageous ports of Japan continue to be
open to the American fleet. This is
looked upon by the authorities here as
an evidence of the friendly disposition
of Japan toward the United States. It
leaves both the ports of China and
Japan open to our ships. When the
Japanese decree of neutrality is is
sued, there is a strong hope, based on
reliable information, that it will con
tain what is known as a "hospita nl '
coal clause." This would afford ample
facilities to warships to lay in a neces
sary coal supply at Japanese ports, to
carry them to the next home port.
While the privilege could be enjoyed by
Spain as well as the United States, yet
the effect would be of distinct ad
vantage to the United States, as it is in
Asiatic waters that the United States
most needs hospitable ports for coaling.

Ex-President Harrison Talks of the
Glorious Achievement of Com
modore Dewey.
INDIANAPOLIS, May 2.â General
Benjamin Harrison was seen at his
home to-ni^ht and asked for an expres
sion on the great naval victory. He
prepared the following expression:
"If the accounts we have received are
correct, the performance of our fleet
under Commodore Dewey at Manila
will take a very high place in naval
history. The passing at night into a
harbor that was mined, to encounter
at dawn the Spanish fleet under the
guns of heavy land fortifications, and
that without any reconnolssance or dil
atory preliminaries, was a magnificent
exhibition of pluck. It recalls Farragut
and Mobile Bay. The fight must have
been very hot. and we can hardly, I
suppose, have escaped some losses in
the gallant crewâ if not of ships. I
have undaunted faith in the American
navy. Ship for ship and man for ma*" â
it is unn.atched."
ALL EUROPE IS
IMPRESSED BY
THE VICTORY
Realizes That American Ships (ire
Well Able to Hold Theiri Owq
With Any Afloat.
WASHINGTON, May 2.â lt is likely that the Government will re
tain possession of at least one good port, such as Manilja, for a coal
ing station and base of supplies during the remainder jof the war.
There was understood to be a considerable force in the Philippines and
a large number of natives are said to be "loyal," mean! ng, in that
sense, attached to fche SpaniÃh fortunes. With this material on one
hand and the insurgents on the other, the latter stimul ited by the
overthrow of the Spanish at Manila, it Is probable that civil war may
rage on the islands for some time outside of Manila proper. It is be
lieved the officials have not decided what to do with the islands at the
end of the war, but in their possession the United State s will enjoy
a powerful weapon in enforcing terms of peace with Spain. Supposing
Porto Rica shall next be seized, it would seem that Spain vill have lit
tle to encourage her in further resistance, particularly as the fall of
Porto Rico would mean the loss of her ironclad fleet shoulc it cross the
Atlantic. There is no talk yet of European intervention,
but one of the most beneficial results of Devey's victory
yesterday is that a deep impression has been made upon (he European
powers, which can now no longer afford to blind themselves to the fact
that, man to man, the American navy is equal to any in the world.
There was no exhibition such as was sneeringly predicted in the Euro
pean press, of weakness in the American fleet, caused by the fact that
it was of heterogeneous composition. It is safe to say that after the
battle at Manila the European powers will conclude that the American
flag always floats over an American crew, regardless of the national
ity or racial descent of the men who fight behind the guns.
The impression produced is likely to deter the European powers
from hasty intervention, and the present indications are that we shall
be left to settle our affairs with Spain at our own pleasure, providing
we do not get involved in the Eastern question through obtaining pos
session of the Philippines.
It is entirely possible that Commodore Dewey may secure his pro
motion to the rank of admiral through the splendid exhibition of pluck,
discretion and sailor qualities he made in yesterday's engagement. The
naval law, however, does not permit of promotion except by seniority,
so that it' would probably be requisite for Congress to pass a special
resolution, such as was done in the case of Commodore Melville, to
afford him a well-earned promotion.

Gibbons, the energetic young officer
who has done so much to for . the na

other battalion of 130 men which would
be ready soon for active service.
Commander Little of the Rhode Is- j

the department and explained that he
had 200 men ready for mobilization.
Commander N -ton of the North Caro

Four flags were displayed to-day for
the first time in many months from the
staffs of the State, War and Navy De

front a huge garrison flag floated, all
in honor of the victory of the American
fleet at Manila yesterday.
The War Department is bending all
its energies to the mustering in of the
volunteers and the recruiting of the

60,000 men. Ââ
Secretary Alger and General Miles
had a long conference with the Presi
dent this afternoon, presumably in re
gard to appointments to the volun

In a few days all the troops that have
been ordered to Tampa are expected to
reach that place, and the eight large
transports which are to conduct the
first expedition to Cuba have been or
dered to proceed to Tampa. The of
ficials, however, decline to m.-ike public
any information regarding the expedi
tion or the place In Cuba- where it is
to land. The Quartermaster's Depart
ment has begun negotiations with rail
road companies for the transportation
of volunteers to their mobilizing points,
and it is expected arrangements will
be made for uniform rates on all the
lines, so as to move the troops with the
least expense to the Government. Gen
eral Wesley Merritt, commanding the
Department pf the East with headquar
ters at New York, reported at the War
Department to-day for consultation
with Secretary Alger. The purpose of
his visit, other than stated, was not
divulged. The officers of the Com
missary Department at New York city
to-day opened proposals for supplying
food to an army of 185,000 men if the
Government finds it necessary to con

officials are opposed to buying concen

Department of the service.

SAILS AWAY UNDER
SEALED ORDERS.
Steamship Yale, Formerly the Paris,
Is Now Off on a Mysterious
Mission.
NEW YORK, May 2.â The steamship
Tale, formerly the American liner
Paris, left her docks shortly before 6
o'clock to-nigrht under sealed orders.
When the vessel swung out from her
pier, hundreds of steam vessels on the
river saluted her with their whistles,
and a number of small cannon in the
vicinity boomed salutes. On the bridge
of the Yale stood Captain Watkins, her
former commander, and by his side
Captain W. C. Wise* of the United
States navy, her present commander.
A Sandy Hook pilot was also on the
bridge. The Yale carried a full supply
of stores for an extended cruise, and
had 5000 tors of coal aboard. The last
of the proT!**ons were put in the hold
just before she sailed. A navy yard
tug, with the last of the ammunition
for the rapid-fire guns, arrived at the
pier in the afternoon and the supplies
were rapidly hoisted aboard the Yale.

DIPLOMATS ON

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, May 2.â A Washington
dispatch to the Herald says: In no
quarter is more intense interest taken
in newÃ of the great naval battle of the
Philippines than among diplomats at
Washington. At all embassies and le
gations the deductions made from the
news thus far cabled is the same â a
decisive victory for Admiral Dewey's
fleet.
No official advices have yet been re
j ceived by any of the diplomats, but
without exception they all agree that
Admiral Dewey has not only been suc
| cessful. in the naval engagement, but
' that it is only a question of a few hours
[ when he will have silenced all the Span
i ish guns ashore and taken control of
{ Manila,
With the Philippines now certainly
lost to Spain and an early bombard
ment of Havana, which every one con
cedes will result disastrously to Spain,
diplomats here now are looking for an
early termination of the war. The
Spanish defeat at Manila will undoubt
edly have a demoralizing effect in Mad
rid and tend to complicate an already
critical situation. Another crushing
blow in Cuban waters ought, in the
opinion of most diplomats here, to place
Spain in a position where she will be
suing for terms of peace. This will un
doubtedly be the advice given her by
the powers.
Leading diplomats here say that no
European intervention is likely to en
sue as a result of the Spanish disaster
in the Philippines. They still consider
that the main bone of contention â the
ending of the war in Cuba and the es
tablishment of an independent form of
government â remains unsettled and
that there will be no justification for
Interfering from any quarter until the
United States has completely removed
Spain from Cuba. With the victory of
Admiral Dewey's fleet in the Pacific,
repeated by Admiral Sampson's in the
Atlantic, the powers will then bring
pressure upon Spain to submit to the
inevitable and withdraw her forces
from Cuba.
Appreciating as she must her weak
ness both at home and abroad Spain
will in all probability be glÂ«d to yield
to the advice of the powers, especially
if it Is coupled with an assurance of the
preservation of the prese t dynasty.
At least this is the general opinion here
to-night among members of the diplo
matic corps.

HAVANA, May 2.â To-day was thÂ«
Spanish national holiday, In commem
oration of the victory ninety years ap^
at Madrid over the French, and it
passed off with considerable enthusi
asm. The Spanish are confident th:>t
"soon will occur another glorious deed
of valor against the stranger, thus per
petuating Spanish renown."
At 4:30 this afternoon, when this dis
patch is sent, three American warships
are in sight of Havana.
At 6:30 o'clock last Friday evening
an American ironclad, three smaller
vessels and six boats, evidently Intend
ed to be used in landing marines, ap
peared in front of Herradura Beach,
on Cabanas Bay. The Spanish gueril
las fired upon them and the American
ships answered the fire with cannon.
The guerrilla troops were then re-en
forced by Spanish regulars. The
American fleet retired and about two
hours afterward moved in the direction
of Dominica Beach. The Spanish
troops suffered no losses and nothing
is known as to the Ic-ss of any of the
Americans.
Yesterday morning, about 9 o'clock,
the American squadron began to move
in front of Havana. From' the shore
the principal vessel seemed to be the
lowa, and not the Indiana, judging
from the tall smokestack and the
abundant deckwc-rk.
At about 10:30 in the morning the
correspondent saw six vessels forme 1
in battle line and moving toward
Florida. At the same time a fast v*s
sel, going at full speed and at a â -
distance from shore, passed from West
to east, returning at 11:30 a. m. and
joining three other vessels, which in the
meantime had come together In front
of Havana, where they were drawn up
in battle line. At 11:30 p. m. (Sunday)
all but one had disappeared.
At 3 o'clock this afternoon the British
cruiser Talbot appeared in front of
Morro Castle and saluted, the saluta
tion being answered from Cabanas fort
ress. The Talbot did not enter the har
bor, but sent an officer in a launch who
delivered documents to Mr. Gollan, the
British Consul, after which he accom
panied Mr. Gollan to pay hiÃ respects
to the Spanish admiral.
Mr. Gollan and Mr. Jerome, the Brit
ish Vice-consul, later visited Â¥\\a
palace, where they had a conference
with General Blanco and his. chief of
staff. General i'ando.
Senor Marin Concepcion Duarte, a
Portuguese, has presented to. Mr. Gol
lan. in the latter's capacity as represen
tative of Americans, a claim for $50,000
in gold and bank paper for the bank of
Madrid, together with a claim for Jew
elry, cloth and other merchandise,
which he declares was taken by the
crew of the American warship which
captured the Spanish passenger steam

CAPTURE OF A
RICH PRIZE, AN
OCEAN BATTLE
After Taking a Spanish Steamer Near
Cienfue&os United States Cruisers
Quickly Rout a Gunboat.
OX BOARD THE HERALD-CALL DISPATCH-BOAT, SOMMERS N. SMITH, off Sand Key. via Key
West. . Fla., May 2. â The cruisers Marblehead and Nashville and the converted yacht Eagle, forming the fourth
division of the N rth Atlantic squadron and under command of Commander Bowman H. McCalla of the Marblehead.
- i the early part of iast week for the south coast of Cuba. The division arrived off Cienfuegos on Friday morning.
About 10 o'clock the Nashville sighted a steamer to the westward and began a chase. After a couple of hours the
steamer was hove to by a shot across her bows, and an armed boat's crew was sent aboard.
The prize proved to be the Spanish mail steamer Argonata. bound from Batabano for Cienfuegos. The Ar
ata is an ir."i steamer 1 1 about =00 tons burden, single screw and two-masted, schooner rigged, laden with a general
nd carrying forty passengers. Among the latter were ten Spanish officers and ten soldiers. These, with their
is and accoutrements and 500 rounds of ammunition, were transferred to the Nashville. The prize was captured
â¢ ighl miles west of Cienfuegos. The Marblehead steamed toward the Nashville and the Argonata and Eagle re
. .::.. lined at the entrance t" the harbor.
At half-past v o'clock the Eagle was seen to begin firing her guns. She hoisted a signal that she was being
icked by the enemy's torpedo-boats. The Marblehead steamed to the assistance of the little Eagle, which was
hg her two guns. The Spanish torpedo-boat was inside the harbor firing her eight-inch guns at the Eagle, but at
range, about 5000 yard-*.
â¢ "â¢â  The Marblehead was tired upon as soon as she was off the western point of the entrance to the harbor. Then
: . 'â '.<;â  McCalla opened lire with his five-inch guns, and the torpedo-boat beat a hasty retreat. Many shells
iboul the Eagle, and it is fortunate she was not struck. The range was long for the six-pounders with which the
lin Southerland, commanding the Eagle, says he thinks he struck the enemy several times. It
â  mown with certainty if any damage was done to the torpedo-boat. After the transfer of the prisoners from
to the Nashville the passengers of the Argonata were sent ashore under flags of truce in their own boats.
.vow from the Nashville was put aboard the prize, and Ensign H. C. Kutzli was put in charge of it. After cruising
trance to the harbor until late in the afternoon the squadron steamed to the westward. The Nashville
it-to Key West for coal.
All the captured officers were lieutenants except one. Colonel Vicente de Cortigo y Navarro, commanding a
'. criVri ;- v regiment of Principe, who was on his way to Spain to be promoted to a generalship. The other officers had
k cc . i near Batabano. and were being transferred to another station. The soldiers were bound
f or . ; [ c Cuba. They are a sickly looking lot and showing the effect of the climate on Europeans. Colonel
Vie( . _ Â«>o soldiers have "been sent from Spain, and to-day only 60.000 are fit for duty.

IN SYMPATHY
WITH AMERICA
Majority of the People of

Practically Solid lor the

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, May 2.â The question as to
i whether British sympathy is really
â  with America is still agitating those
who are chiefly interested in establish
ing- a good understanding between the
two nations. Alfred Harmsvvorth
who, personally and through his paper,
has been doing the most efficient work
in this direction is convinced that a
large majority of the people of the
United Kingdom are unreservedly in
sympathy with the United States. He
bases his conviction on a careful can
vass of the country, which he has-* just
completed. It shows that Scotland is
practically solid for America, and that
Ireland, except in the north, is hostile
to America. Of the merchants, ship
pers and business men generally, 30
per cent are keenly American; 35 per
cent are neutral and 35 per cent are
against war anywhere.
The non-conformists are solidly pro-
American, while 90 per cent of the Ro
man Catholics are pro-Spanish in all
cases, according tn the figures collected.
The British aristocracy, aside from
the Catholics, is evenly divided, while
the Jews are opposed to America.
On the subject of Catholic opposition
to America, the Daily Mail in an article
printed to-day, says: "It is largely due
to distinguished members of the Catho
lic artistocracy and to the Catholic pre
lacy of the United Kingdom and Ire
land that a slight sympathy for Spain
has been worked up during the past
few days. The priests and people alike
are intent on showing th'ir interest in
the country which is a firmer stmng
hold of tho church than Italy, and great
efforts are making to force the trend of
public opinion. This fact and the
strong Irish feeling explains why so
few Nationalist members of the House
of Commons have spoken publicly in
favor of the United States. Redmond
and Dillon have spoken, but the latter
was immediately attacked by the
widely circulated Catholic organ in
England, tho Catholic Times."

LONDON, May 3.â A dispatch to the

Business is paralyzed and great dis

telegrams prevents any news getting to
the outside world.
PACIFIC PORTS
ARE NOW SAFE
FROM ATTACK
NEW YORK, May 2â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald sends
the following: In destroying the Span
ish fleet before attempting: to take a port
in the Philippines for use as a base of
operations, Commodore Dewey has act
ed in accordance With orders sent to
him by Secretary Long. It can be
stated on high authority that Secretary
Long cabled Commodore Dewey eight
days ago informing him that war had
broken out between the United States
and Spain and directing him to sail at
once for the Philippines and commence
operations. His attention was specially
called to the Spanish fleet, which Sec
retary Long declared "must" be cap
tured or destroyed before any other
action was taken.
That Dewey carried out his Instruc
tions to the letter is now a matter of
history- But the destruction of the
Spanish fleet and seizure of the islands
this Government has taken a step
which, it is believed, will prevent Spain
from conducting: any operations what
ever against ports on the Pacific Coast.
What the officials have feared has been
in the event of Commodore Dewey's re
pulse the Spanish men-of-war in the
Philippines would harass the American
trade with the Orient; that privateers
would .be fitted out and that in a short
time American commerce would be
driven from the Pacific. With the Span
ish fleet destroyed this fear fled.
Having effectually disposed of the
Spanish men-of-war, Commodore
Dewey, under department instructions,
will nt once turn every attention to the
capture of Manila, and it is the firm
expectation of the department that the
insurgents of the island will aid him
in his assault upon that city. Sanguine
of success, the officials are now with
drawing their attention from the Phil
ippines and are centering it on Cuba
and the Atlantic.
Commander R. Bradford of the Bu
reau of Equipment, by direction of Sec
retary Long, telegraphed to-day to
Rear Admiral Kirkland, commandant
of Mare Island navy yard, to ascertain
the amount of coal which this Govern
ment has at that point and a reply was
received in the afternoon showing that
there are 4000 tons at that point. The
department is seriously considering the
advisability of sending colliers laden
with coal to the Philippines for the use
of American men-of-war. This will not
On the Deck of a Yankee Man-of-War in Action*
[be done, however, until Commodore
! Dewey has been heard from and he
' Bhows it is necessary for him to obtain
â  supplies. In this event the cruiser
! Charleston, which has been ordered into
j commission, will convoy the colliers
! and act as general supply ship to Ma
j nila. As Commodore Dewey was given
1 carte blanche in the matter of purehas
! ing supplies it is believed in naval cir
cles that he has contracted for coal
and such other supplies to be delivered
on the high seas as he may need. Be
sides, it was pointed out to-day that the
j collier Nanshan, which accompanied
! hia fleet, had a cargo of 3."00 tons and
i in addition the vessels were loaded to
' their fullest bunker capacity with coal.
j It was estimated by Engineer-in-Chief
Melville that only one-tenth of the to
tal coal capacity of each ship had been
exhausted in making the slow run from
Hongkong to Manila and that the ves
sels can go without coaling for some
time. From the Nanshan it will be pos
sible to recoal every ship. It is also be
lieved that the supply ship Zarlro which
j had ammunition aad other supplies
i aboard also carried coal. So far as the
ammunition of the ships is concerned
Captain Charles O'Neil. chief of the
Bureau of Ordnance, told me that there
need be no fear that Commodore Dew
cy's vessels would run out of ammuni
' tlon.
Rear Admiral Walker, who since noy-
I hood has been to Commodore Dewey as
I Damon to Pythias, expresses himself
to-day as highly gratified with the news
received from the Philippines.
"As far as we can judge." said Ad
miral Walker, "the Spanish fleet at
that point has been annihilated. The
job was done in a neat and workman
like manner that must command the
admiration of the world. Dewey is a
gallant officer, thorough and possessing
the sand to achieve such a victory, and
he has fine officers with him. I knew
he would do this thing the best way
when I heard of his being chosen for
the place. 'Don't be afarid; Dewey
will come out ahead." I said to friends,
when discussing this enagagement as
I a probability. It is great luck for
Dewey to have this chance, for we are
not fighting people, you know. He
served bravely and with distinction
during the civil war, but he was a sub
ordinate officer.
"It is great luck," continued Admiral
Walker. reflectively, as if regretting the
fact that he had not himself the
privilege of risking his life for glory
and country by the side of his deax
,est friend.
INVADING ARMY
TO BE DISPATCHED
TO CUBA AT ONCE
NEW YORK, May 2.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
While careful to announce that serious
consideration is being given the advis
ability of delaying the dispatch of the
army expedition to Cuba, the authori
ties are steadily continuing their efforts
to effect the capture and occupation of
a base of supplies. These efforts will
culminate within the next two or three
days in an attack which will be made
by the vessels of Rear Admiral Samp
son's fleet upon the port selected for
capture.
It was admited by the authorities
that the publication by the Herald yes
terday of the information that the
Spanish fleet is bound west caused them
to consider the advisability of delaying
the transportation of a force to Cuba,
but at a conference held at the White
House this afternoon it was determined
to proceed with the preparations for
dispatching the expedition. Secretary
Alger was in consultation to-day with
Secretary Long and Rear Admiral
Sicard, the latter being president of the
Naval War Board, in order to make
the co-operation of the army and navy
in the attack upon the Cuban port se
lected for seizure as harmonious as
possible. At the White House confer
ence, which was participated in by the
President, Secretary Alger, Secretary
Long and Major-General Miles, plans
were discussed.
It is understood that it has been
practically determined to order by
Thursday morning more than 6000
troops to leave Tampa and go directly
to Cuba. The Government has pro
vided the necessary transports to carry
the men and all the needfui provisions
are now on hand at Tampa. General
Shafter and his staff have probably by
this time .established their headquarters
with the invading army, and are only
awaiting the final orders from Wash
ington before beginnning the move
ment which will undoubtedly free
Cuba.
As soon as the army lands on Cuban
soil a union will be effected with the
insurgents, and an immediate move
will be made against Havana.
In determining to send the army to
Cuba the authorities have been guided
by their conviction that the American
fleet will easily dispose of the Spanish
men-of-war now on their way west.
The naval war board has been care
: fully considering the point where the
I enemy's fleet is apt to strike, and It is
the opinion of the members that an.
effort will be made to flre a port in
order to do as much damage as possi
ble, after which the attacking fleet wilt
scurry to Porto Rico.
The auxiliary cruiser St. Louis is ex
expected to arrive in the vicinity of
Porto Rico by Thursday, and the auxil
iary cruiser Harvard, which was in her
company when she sailed from New
York, is expected to proceed to a>
point between Porto Rico and the CaTv
ary Islands. These two vessels are
solely on scouting duty. When the
auxiliary cruiser St. Paul leaves
League island she will have on board Â»
supply of coal sufficient to keep her at
sea for a month at least, and it is ex
pected that she will create great havoc
among Spanish merchantmen, besides
gathering information which will be of
prreat value to this Government. Ii can
be stated authoritatively that as sooo.
as the Spanish fleet is reported at mr;
point there will be, as the Herald has
stated, a junction of the armor c!ad3
of the North Atlantic and flying squad
rons, and under the command of Rear
Admiral Sampeon this fore? will meve
to give battle to the enemy.
It has been determined that the naval
policy of this Government in its opera
tion in the Atlantic shall be primarily
defensive, and if Spain wantd a sea
fight she must seek it.

there will be a fight in Cuban waters.

EMERGENCY
MEASURE IS
NOW PASSED
Both Houses of Congress
Unanimous in Granting
Funds for War.
Naval Appropriation Bill Is Also
Finally Passed and Goes at
Once to President McKin
ley for Approval.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, May 2.
Beveral war measures were passed by
the Senate to-day, and notwithstand
ing their importance, not one of them
elicited the slightest debate. Probably
the most important measure passed by
the Senate was the emergency war de
ficiency bill, carrying $36,720,945. Not
more than ten minutes were consumed
In passing it, that time being occupied
in reading the measure.
.Hawley, chairman of the Military Af
fairs Committee, secured the passage
of a bill providing for the enlistment of
a volunteer brigade of engineers and of
10,000 men in the South who are immune
to yellow fever, these enlistments to be
in addition to those provided for in the
President's call for 125,000 volunteers.
The men will enlist "for the war."
Two other war measures were passed,
one suspending, for the duration of the
war, the resmctions placed by existing
laws upon the quartermaster's depart
ment of the army in order that supplies
may be purchased without the present j
formalities; and the others providing
that owners of mining claims shall not
forfeit them for not performing assess
ment work upon them, provided they
enlist for the war. The war revenue
measure massed by the House of Rep
resentatives last Friday was received
by the Senate and referred to the
Finance Committee for consideration.
At the opening of the Senate's session !
the chaplain offered devout thanks fur
th<- glorious victory won by Commodore i
Dcwey's Asiatic squadron.
The final conference report on the naval |
appropriation bill was agreed to.
The resolution presented last Thursday i
by Butler of North Carolina, declaring :
that no necessity existed for ifsuiny
. bonds to provide funds for the war and
in favor of the levying of an income tax ,
was laid before the Senate.
Bmler, in supporting the resolution, de- I
dared. ln favor of paying the expenses of i
the war "us '.ye ko." No issue of bonds
would be necessary if the war was car
ried' on :<s -Lincoln carried on the civil
conflict. If the navy and !and forces of |
the United States were allowed to move j
on the enemy, promptly and aggressively,
the issue would be over before -'the bond \
sharks" could further succeed in "mort- j
gaging the future of our own people."
The resolution was then referred to the |
finance committee.
The Senate agreed* on motion of Allen, ]
to adjourn from to-day until Wednesday
next, and at 1 o'clock went into execu
tive.
At 2:30 o'clock the doors of the Senate
were opened. The Senate took a recess
until 3 o'clock to await the emergency
war appropriation bill.
When tne Senate reconvened at 3
o'clock the bill was passed to amend the
postal laws relating to the use of postal
cards, so that persons using cards may
provide them under certain restrictions,
and mail them by placing upon each a
one-cent stamp.
The emergency war appropriation bill
was received by the Senate, and Hale
-asked that it be laid before the Senate
and considered at once.
Cha-ndler of New Hampshire inquired
whether the bill had be-en properly con
sidered by the committee.
Hawley, thinking that Chandler referred
to his bill, replied hotly, addressing
Chandler directly.
"That is two or three times the gentle
man has asked me that question about
bills T have reported. I have already stat
ed that the bill was duly considered. I
want you to understand that when I
bring a bill from my committee I tell
the truth about it. The committee has
j^lver: that bill full consideration."
"Do I " understand the Senator from
â¢ Connecticut to say." inquired Chandler,
"that this army deficiency bill has been
before the committee."
"The bill I have got here is not an ap
propriation bill," replied Hawley.
"if the Senator from Connecticut had
kept his temper, he would have learned
that the bill I addressed my remarks to
was not his bill. If he would listen before
he undertakes to lecture me it would do
him good," replied Chandler.
"I do not desire to enter into any dis
cussion with the Senator," replied Haw
ley.
"I think the Senator had better not,"
said Cfiandler. "I addressed myself to
the bill that came from the House of
Representatives and the Senator lectured
me on an entirely different bill."
The war deficiency measure was read
at length and passed without a word of
debate.
The Senate then, at 4 o'clock, under the
order previously made, adjourned until
Wednesday.

SANTA CRUZ, May 2.â Supervisor
James A. Linscott of Watsonville be
lieves he has a clew to persons who, he
thinks, might know something about
the powder mill explosion. He was in
his store at Watsonville on the morn
ing of the explosion. At about 9 o'clock
two Spaniards entered the store, one of
whom was attired in the regulation
Spanish costume. The other wore drab
clothes. The one in the Spanish cos
tume had nothing to say, but the other
Call Office, Rlggs House,
Washington, May 2.
The passage of the emergency war
bill was the feature of to-day's action
by the House. The naval appropriation
bill, with the Senate amendment pro
viding for the payment of officers of the
navy for the use of their inventions by
the Government stricken out, was re
ported from the conference and passed.
It now goes to the President.
Cannon, in explaining the necessity of
the emergency war appropriation,
pointed out that there was not a dollar
available from any source to meet these
demands. Prompt <u:tion was demanded
in each instance to place at the dispo
sal of the authorities means to equip
and make most efficient the forces of
the United States.
Steele of Indiana, Interrupting, said
he had been advised at the War De
partment that the Federal Government
would pay and desired to pay imme
diately volunteers from the moment of
their enrollment, and Sayers added that
the Government would pay all expenses
of volunteers incident to their move
ment from their homes to the place of
enrollment.
Dingley of Maine called attention to
the probable expense of the war and
necessity for extraordinary revenue. He
said the $50,000,000 appropriated for de
fense had been exhausted; that the
present emergency bill carried $36,000,
000 and the expenditures made neces
sary by reason of the war would prob
ably amount very soon to $100,000,000
because of the fortification appropria
tions.
The bill was then passed without
division.
Lacey of lowa presented the confer
ence report on the general Alaskan bill
extending the homestead laws to and i
granting railroads rights of way In the !
Territory.
Loud reserved a point of order pend- |
ing an explanation of the measure as j
involving new legislation. The confer- I
ence measure carried among other im-.
portant provisions one for the creation j
of a commission to consider the North i
Atlantic fishery question and another
to promote reciprocal trade relations
between the United States and Canada.
Dingley protested against the fea
ture orf the report creating a commis
sion to consider the North Atlantic
fishery question and other controver
sies. He believed the conferees had ex
ceeded their authority in incorporating
the resolution, and moreover, the posi
tion itself was not such to command
such support.
Moody of Massachusetts spoke, and
concluded by making a point of order
against the amendment that it was be
yond the jurisdiction of the conferees
as being beyond their duties.
Shafroth of Colorado spoke in sup
port of the conference report.
Speaker Reed 'sustained the point of
order made by Moody and the report
was declared rejected, and another con
ference asked with Lacey, Shafroth
and Ellis as House conferees.
Boutelle of the conferees on the
naval bill announced the result of a
further conference with the Senate in
an agreement whereby the amendment
providing for the compensation of na
val officers for governmental use of
their inventions had been stricken out.
It was this amendment to which the
House objected on Saturday, and it
having been eliminated the bill and
conference report were accepted.
The bill to increase the number of
surgeons in the army was passed.
Loud of California called up a reso
lution providing for the creation of a
congressional commission to make an
exhaustive examination into the postal
service. In support of the resolution
Loud and Fleming of Georgia said fre
quent statements had been made in
Congress and the press suggesting
abuses that had grown up in the ser
vice, and the field was apparently one
inviting investigation.
The resolution was passed.
The bill providing for the suspension
of certain statutes relating to the Com
missary Department was received from
the Senate with Senate- amendments,
and on motion of Hull the House voted
to non-concur.
At 4:35 p. m. the House adjourned.
one asked for rubber washers, but could
not find the kind desired.
At the time Mr. Linscott spoke to his
clerk about his suspicion, and said he
would follow them up. They drove
away toward Santa Cruz. When he
heard of the explosion he thought of
the men who had been in his store that
morning.
The inquest over those killed in the
powder mill explosion was to have been
held this morning at 10 o'clock, but
Coroner Clark has not yet grot all the
witnesses desired. The inquest has
been set for Wednesday morning at
9:30 o'clock. The result is watched
with much interest.
WOODLAND, May 2.â Captain Ward
forwarded to headquarters to-day a roll
containing the names of all members
of Company F, who pledge themselves
that when notified by the Governor
they will present themselves for muster
into the United States service. The poll
contained eighty-three names. The roll
was accompanied by the assurance that
the company would be recruited to the
maximum number. The company was
inspected this evening by Colonel J. T.
Hay of Fresno.
VALLEJO. May 2.â Lieutenant Moses
of the Marine Corps left this afternoon
for the Norfolk Navy Yard. The
Charleston will go into commission on
Thursday. There has been no assign
ment of officers as yet.
Will Not Intervene at Present.
LONDON, May 3.âThe Vienna cor
respondent of the Times says: In well
informed circles it is positively denied
that the powers will intervene at the
present juncture, nor has any agree
ment been arrived at for mediation at
any future time. The disparity of
views ie considered enough to render
highly improbable the co-operation of
all six powers in any diplomatic step,
either at Madrid or Washington.
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 3, 1898.
WATCHING FOR
SPANISH SHIPS
It Is Believed the Cape
Verde Fleet Is Alter
the Oregon.
If Such Proves to Be the Case
Fast Cruisers Will Be Sent
to the Rescue.
Then No TimÂ© Will Be Lost in Land
ing an Army to Take Possession
of Cuba.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, May 2.
Elated over the Philippine victory
and reports from British forces that
the Spaniards have surrendered or are
about to surrender Manila, the War
and Navy Departments are eager to
strike a second decisive blow, and this
time it will be in Cuban waters.
When the sailing of the Cape Verde
fleet in a westerly direction was an
nounced it was decided to postpone the
landing of troops on Cuban soil, for it
was feared that Spain's vessels might
be heading for the northern seaboard
to attack one of our coast cities. In
thiÃ case Admiral Sampson's fleet
would have to withdraw from the
blockade before Havana, join the fly
ing squadron and give battle to the
Spanish fleet wherever it might be.
This would leave the troops landed in
Cuba in a perilous situation. They
would not have had time to fortify
themselves against an attack from
General Blanco's superior force.
While the Navy Department lacks
definite information as to the destina
tion of Spain's fleet, it may be said
upon the authority of a high official or
the department that while Porto Rico
was at first thought to be the fleet's
destination, seine doubt of this is now
entertained, and it has been pointed
out by members of the war board that
Spain, improvident as usual, has failed
to lay in an abundance of coal at Porto
Rico, and could not stand a long siege.
It was also said that it would be sim
ply suicidal for the Spanish fleet to at
tack any of our Atlantic Coast cities,
on account of the same lack of coal.
The British having declined in advance
to supply any coal to war vessels, ex
cept enough to steam them home, the
Spaniards would have no other source
of supply, and they would be at the
mercy of the combined American
fleets.
Where is the Spanish fleet bound
then, if not to the North Atlantic coast
or Cuban waters? That is the question
now agitating the navy. The almost
universal belief is that Spain's vessels
will waylay and attack the Oregon and
Marietta and the report received to-night
to the effect that the Spanish torpedo
boat Temerario had also reached Rio
was calculated to strengthen the belief
that the Oregon and the Marietta are to
be made the victims of Spain's superior
force in numbers.
The department is now considering
aÂ» plan by which the design may be
frustrated. If any one of our fast
cruisers now scouting in the Atlantic
brings news that Spain's fleet is headed
for San Rogue, the flying squadron will
be sent in hot haste to the relief of the
Oregon and Marietta, while Admiral
Sampson's fleet will remain before Ha
vana and assist in landing Shafter's
men.
Having concluded that Spain's fleet
will not have the temerity to attack
Sampson, or the foolhardiness to at
tempt an attack on our coast, the War
Department plans to establish a base of
supplies at or near Matanzaswill be vig
orously pushed.
Based upon information received from
naval officers competent to judge it was
predicted in these dispatches Friday
night that Commodore Dewey's squad
ron would steam economically and ap
pear before Manila Sunday morning;
that a decisive battle would be fought
before sundown in which the Americans
would be victorious. From advices re
ceived from the same source it is be
lieved that by the last of this week a
gpeat naval and military demonstration
will be made in Cuban waters and our
troops will effect a landing at or near
Matanzas.

Execution of a Spy Who
Joined the Cuban
â¢ Army.
Caught Trying to Drop " Dope"
Into the Food Prepared for
the Insurgent General.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, May 2.â A Washington
special to the Herald say 3: Lieutenant
Artigo of the Cuban army, now in
Washington, has received a letter from
his cousin, Captain Charles Machado,
now with the insur-ren-. forces, in
which he says:
"The most interesting bit of new 3 I
have to tell you is about tho capture In
our camp of a spy. He was a ion-com
missioned officer, but he tivs no more.
He presented himself to our command
ing general as born Cuban, and was
duly enrolled. His intelligence was of
high character and he was raised from
the ranks. He established close com
panionship with the cook of General
Garcia, a poor and unintelligent negro
from Santa Clara. The spy would have
put poison in the food of our beloved
leader had he not been apprehended.
He was caught red-handed, and con
vincing evidence was found on his per
son. There was a slight disposition to
kill him without a hearing, but the
generosity of our general would not
permit this. He was tried fairly and
executed.
"We have had several encounters
with the enemy, and inflicted consider
able loss on Spain. It has been practi
cally all guerrilla war. We are weary,
but our patience upholds us. We do
little but range around the river so as
to be prepared to cover the landing of
the gallant Nunez when he and our
brothers shall come. The name Amer
ican is a safeguard and passport
throughout this island, except in â  the
little patches of territory controlled by
the enemy. We recently made prison
ers of three officers of Spain. They are
Captain Loch, Lieutenant Vega and
Lieutenant Martilez."

AT SPANIARDS
Movement Being Arranged to
Crush the Fleets of the
Enemy in Atlantic
Waters.
Copyrighted, 189 S. by James Gordon Bennett.
KEY WEST, Fla., May 2.â There is a feeling here to-day that some
important and decisive movement of Admiral Sampson's fleet is pend
ing. All day there has been an unmistakable bustle of preparations on
the vessels In the harbor. Officers ashore do not conceal their elation
over the prospect of breaking the monotony of the blockade. The news
of Admiral Dewey's brilliant victory has fired them with a spirit of
emulation, and the Spanish battery or ship which comes within the
range of their guns will suffer. In the coming movement sufficient
force will be massed to crush the opposition. From now \on the war in
these waters will probably be conducted more vigorously. Spain had a
chance to peaceably withdraw from Cuba and permit the starving re
concentrados to be relieved. She must now soon face the consequences.
I am not at liberty to disclose the exact nature and location of the com
ing operations, but there is likely to be news from Cuba or other West
ern waters before the week is out.
There is great activity about the Government coaling docks. More
than 200 Cubans have volunteered to join the army of invasion at
Tampa. There was an enormous crowd at the dock to bid the patriots
farewell, and much enthusiasm was displayed. The volunteers marched
from San Carlos Hall to the steamer in a body carrying their baggage.
At the hall they were addressed by General Nunez and other Cuban
leaders.

Woed Miss Virginia Lowery
of the "Exclusive Set
in Vain.
An Experience That Probably Gave
the Commodore Zest for His
Work at Manila-
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, May 2.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Club chat
ter among the intimates of Commodore
Dewey revives the fact of a previous
encounter with- Spain ip which he did
not come out first, and causes comment
that he probably enjoyed settling a per
sonal score, along the line of duty to his
country. Love, not war, was the source
of the original trouble. The devotion
of Commodore Dewey to Miss Virginia
Lowery, the handsome dauhter of
Archibald Lowery, one of the most
prominent and wealthy of the exclusive
"residential set" in Washington, is well
known here.
Miss Lowery was beautiful in the
grande dame fashion, and a woman of
definite views as to what would make
up her happiness. When very young
she became engaged to the dashing, im
pecunious secretary of the Spanish Le
gation, Count "Jack" Brunetti. Her
father refused to sanction the affair,
but declining all other offers, even that
of the present hero of the hour, Miss
Lowery kept during twenty years her
plighted troth. Three seasons ago,
however, with the consent of her father,
she became the wife of the Duke d'Ar
cos, her devoted and loyal squire, who
not only had inherited title and estates,
but represented his country as Minister
to Mexico.
The admiral resented bitterly his de
feat by a foreign nation, and it is prob
able sent hot shots with added vim, re
calling the horrid day when Jack tar
Cupid set Spain's flag above the stars
and stripes on the trim craft of his
iicuru' desire.

MADRID, May 2.â The celebrations
in honor of the Spanish officers, Ruiz,
Daoiz and Velardez, the victims of
Murat's massacre, have proceeded to
day as usual, in spite of the bad news
from the Philippines. A fine proces
sion was headed by the civic guards,
twelve abreast. followed by the
orphans, the Madrid charities, veterans,
municipal functionaries and officials
and others. Several regiments of
troops brought up the rear. The
streets were packed, but there was no
outward display of sorrow.
In political circles, however, im
portant developments are hourly ex
pected. Senor Romero Robledo
(leader of the Weylerite party) will in
terpellate the Government in Congress
to-morrow on the events at Manila, and
the Carlists and Republicans will par
ticipate in the debate, which is expected
to have important results.
It as asserted that the burning of the
Reina Christina was due to American
petroleum bombs and that a number of
thatched huts belonging to natives
were set on fire in the same w r ay.
The procession passed off amid glori
ous sunshine, but there were no pa
triotic speeches.
The minds of the people are too full
of the disaster to think of anything but
avenging the surprise at Manila Bay.
Senor Aguilera, the Civil Governor of
Madrid, did not take part in the pro
cession. All his energies were required
to watch closely popular feeling, which
is certain to explode and to require a
scapegoat.

SACRAMENTO, May 2.â The cheers
that went up from Sacramento last
night when the news of Admiral
Dewey's victory came reminded the
older inhabitants of the time when
Lee's surrender was heralded through
out the city. People gathered in throngs
around the various bulletin boards, and
as each dispatch was shown and the
certainty of an American victory estab
lished there was no mistaking the ex
ultant and joyous spirit. Cheer upon
cheer went up. Everywhere were
groups of men warmly praising the
gallant crews of the American fleet,
who had on the first opportunity offered
so valiantly "remembered the Maine."
A company of State troops which had
attended a religious ceremony, marched
down the street about the time the
news came, and Its martial tread and
soldierly bearing fairly set the people
wild.
At the Orpheum, where standing
room was at a premium, Manager
Clifton had arranged to have the war
bulletins read from the stage. When the
news of the victory came, the vast au
dience arose en masse and shook the
very walls with its shouts and cheers
and hurrahs for the boys in blue.
The news spread with lightning ra
pidity, and for hours the streets were
black with a jostling, good-natured
crowd, which made no endeavor to con
ceal its feelings of unbounded joy. One
man, either intoxicated or insane, made
a disparaging remark about a little flag
a bystander had pinned upon his coat.
When the crowd had finished with the
fellow he was more dead than alive.
The excitement continues to-night.
REDWOOD CITY, May 2.â Men,
women and children of Redwood City
are celebrating to-night the victory of
the American fleet at Manila. They are
parading the streets carrying torches,
with k band playing national airs lead
ing the way, while throughout the city
cannon are booming and fireworks are
painting the sky a lurid hue. Bonfires
blaze on street corners and the shriek
ing of whistles adds to the din. The
demonstration bids fair to continue
througout the night.
STOCKTON, May 2.â "Manila has
fallen!" One loud cheer at the bulletin
boardf and with electrical effect the
news of the triumph of the Yankee sail
ors â¢ and their intrepid commander
spread through the business portion of
the city. Sound American lungs and
the promptings of loyal hearts "-aye the
cheers an echo which resounded to the
homes, and ere long women and young
Americas were en route to the scene of
rejoicing.
All day long crowds have followed the
story of the stirring scenes before Man
ila. " "Good boy, Dewey," and other
familiar terms of endearment were
showered upon the admiral. At the
Armory Companies A and B, hard at
work under drill officers, heard the
news, and it was something like the old
rebel yell which shook the building.
Scenes all over town show that the
American habit of self control does not
stay the spirits of rejoicing when that
spirit is in order.
This afternoon Jn a restaurant a
Spaniard boasted that later reports
would show that Spain vanquished the
American fleet. He insulted a waitress
by his aspersions on the country in
which he is enjoying life and property.
He was not mobbed, but the proprietor
ordered him out of the place and some
good advice was given him.
At the Yosemite Theater, where a per
formance was in progress, a bulletin
was read and it was some time before
the performance could be resumed.
People insisted on cheering and sing
ing. When the militia drilled on the
square great enthusiasm prevailed and
the first noisy demonstration since the
war began occurred.
FRESNO, May 2.â The news of Dew
ey's victory was received in this city
with great rejoicing, although no pub
lic demonstration was made. All day
to-day people gathered in knots and
groups on the sidewalks and discussed
the signal victory. A local paper is
sued a special edition and people gath
ered around the bulletins, eager for fur
ther particulars. It was impossible for
many to get within reading distance of
the bulletins on account of t.he great
crowd. Flags floated from the Court
house staff and all public buildings.
There was a great deal of individual
enthusiasm, but it did not take con
certed form in the shape of a demon
stration.
BENICIA, May 2.â A wave of en
thusiasm swept over this place to-night
in consequence of the glorious victory
at Manila. The people have been on a
tension for so many days that the news
of Dewey's great fight has taken all
doubt from their minds and now they
feel as if it was only a question of
time, and a short time at that. Guns
are being fired, bands are playing,
fireworks burning and every man that
can talk is talking.
"WOODLAND. May 2.â "Woodland had
two representatives in the naval en
gagemnt off Manila on Sunday. George
Ball is on the Petrel and William Dun
phy is on the Olympia.
SALINAS, May 2.â On receipt of bul
letins announcing the naval engage
ment off Cavite and the total defeat of
the Spanish fleet by the Americans un
der Commodore Dewey the citizens of
Salinas assembled in crowds, cheering
and shouting. Flags were hoisted on
all public buildings and on many busi
ness houses. As many of the crew on
the American fleet are known in this
vicinity some anxiety exists as to who
were wounded and killed during the
battle.
SAN JOSE, May 2.â Mews of the sur
render of Manila was enthusiastically
received in this city this evening.
Cheers went up when the announcement
was posted. The news had been hourly
expected. It soon spread over the city
and never before were so many happy
faces seen on our streets. Every one
spoke of the brave and gallant fight of
the American navy, and Commodore
Dewey is the lion of the hour and his
name is upon the lips of all.
At Company B's armory great Joy
was expressed over Dewey's success.
This was regular drill night and most
of the boys in blue had their sweet
hearts or sisters with them, as it was
expected that this would be their last
night at home before being ordered to
the front. Ninety-seven of the com
pany have volunteered for Federal
duty, and all of t'.ese expressed a de
sire to go to the Philippine Islands, as
It was announced earlier in the day
that the California militia might be
sent at once to help brave Dewey hold
the islands.
LOS ANGELES. May 2.â Thousands
of enthusiastic citizens paraded the
main streets of the city for an hour this
evening, shouting themselves hoarse
and carrying small flags of the United
States and Cuba. This was merely a
manifestation of the enthusiasm and
joy which had been crystallized during
the day by the receipt of intelligence
of the victory of the American fleet at
the Philippine Islands.
During the entire day vast crowds
gathered about the bulletin boards. As
day grew on the satisfaction of. the
readers became greater. The grand
parade this evening was purely an in
formal affair. It was not worked up
by any one, but was merely a spon
taneous outburst of satisfaction over
the victory which crowned the Ameri
can flag. Democrats, Republicans,
Populists and Silver Republicans were
in lineâ old and young alike. All were
loud in expressions of their enthusiasm.

SPREAD OF THE BUBONIC
/; i PLAGUEJN THE ORIENT.
Over a Hundred and Fifty Deaths
at Hongkong From January
to April.
TACOHLA, May 2.â The steamship Co
lumbia, arriving to-day from Hong
kong, brings news that the existence
and spread of the bubonic plague is
causing much alarm throughout the
orient. Both the plague and small
pox now exist at Hongkong, Macao,
SwatoW and Canton. Each city is
afraid of the others and the govern
ta of a! 1 are taking measures to
prevent the plague becoming general.
K:u-ly in the year Hongkong held
races which weit largelâ¢ attended.,
particularly by Chinese from Canton.
It is now considered certain that th^-se
brought the plague with them. This
recalls to mind the fact that there was
just such an influx of Chinese coolies
into Honpkont? four years A/^o to at
tend the land and water celebrations
then held. Following that inllux oc
curred the plague oitbieak of 1594,
which gave Hongkon^ a severe scare.
In future it is intended to repress all
siuh gatherings of Chinese from out
ities.
Hongkong has already quarantined
against the cities named. Official re
port states that from January 1 to
April there were 181 cases and 154
deaths there. The Hongkong press,
however, states that many cases are
never heard of, being suppressed by
the Chinese to obviate the work of the
'health authorities, as at Bombay.

REVIVES TALK
OF ANNEXATION
Hawaii's Friends Seek to
Profit by the War
With Spain.
Say Dewey Is Handicapped by
Need of a Base of
Supplies.
Lodge, FryÂ© and Gray Discuss the
Proposed Acquisition of the
Islands.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, May 2.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
Hear Admiral Dewey's victory off Ma
nila and the report that he has estab
lished a blockade at that port was the
subject of serious consideration at the
White House and Navy Department
to-day. In view of the fact that the
Spaniards still controJ the cable from
Manila, or they did when last heard
from, the Navy Department is in ig
norance as to the supply of coal Ad
miral Dewey's fleet has on hand. When
the fleet left Hongkong tor Manila the
coal bunkers of the entire fleet were
filled to their utmost capacity with
fuel. In addition, a collier with a car
g-o of 3500 tons of coal accompanied the
fleet. The question under considera
tion to-day was how much of that coal
supply had been exhausted and how
long the remaining quantity would last
the admiral in the event of a protract
ed blockade at Manila.
As China and Japan have delayed
making their declarations of neutral
ity, it is Halmed by those well versed
in. international law that the United
Siat'-s still has those eastern ports
open to it, where an additional supply
of coal may be obtained.
Rear Admiral Dewey's gallant
achievements rrf yesterday and the able
and courageous support given him by
the officers and men of his fleet render
it imperative that the Government
should not hesitate a moment to send
supplies to him by the fleetest ships
that sail out of San Francisco. This
is no time to speculate what eastern
ports may be open to our ships or in
dulge in "what might have been" dis
cussions in the event of the annexation
of the Hawaiian Islands. The prompt
and vigorous action of Rear Admiral
Dewey in front of the Spanish fleet in
spired the Secretary of the Navy to
take immediate measure to relieve our
fleet in the Pacific Ocean of any em
barrassment it might feel for want of
coal.
Accordingly, orders were telegraphed
to San Francisco this morning for the
Government authorities to select two
of the swiftest ships at that purt. load
them with coal and dispatch them at
once to the relief of Admiral Dev.ey's
fleet.
It was during the consideration of
this subject that the question of an
nexing Hawaii forced itself to the
front. Senator Lodge of Massachu
setts, Senator Frye of Maine and Sen
ator Gray of Delaware, three of the
ablest and best-informed members of
the Committee on Foreign Relations,
were at the Navy Department and dis
cussed the proposition with Secretary
Ivong. Senator Lodge said he regretted
very much the failure of the United
States to> annex Hawaii several years
ago.
"We never needed it as much as we
need it to-day, added the Massachu
setts Senator, with great earnestness.
"It would be an invaluable piece of
property at this moment and to my
opinion the United States should not
hesitate a moment longer about accept
ing the generous and thoroughly busi
ness-like proposition of the Hawaiian
Government.
"Some of the wise men of this gen
eration," continued Senator Lodge,
"were shrewd enough to appreciate the
necessity of the acquisition of Hawaii
by the United States. If our people
who were opposed to annexation would
throw aside political and personal con
siderations and look at the situation
from an international standpoint and
as a plain, practical, business proposi
tion they would insist on the immediate
ratification of the treaty now pendng
before the Senate. Take existing con
ditions into consideration and any
reasonable man will be struck at once
with the importance of the United
States having a base of supplies in the
Pacific Ocean. Here is our gallant
Asiatic squadron fighting successfully
to uphold the national standard in that
far away eastern country. We have no
means of knowing at the present mo
ment what Injuries our ships and crews
may have sustained in yesterday's con
flict We are also in the dark as to the
supply of coal the fleet has at its dis
posal With all foreign ports closed
against us our only recourse is to ship
a coal supply from San Francisco.
"How different would be the condi
tions if Hawaii had been annexed to
the United States before this war with
Spain came on. With cable communi
cation between Hawaii and San Fran
cisco we could relieve Rear Admiral
Dewey's fleet from any embarrassment
it may be subjected to for want of coal.
Consider the difference in the number
of days it takes to go from San Fran
cisco to Manila and that Hawaii is
more than half way between those
points, and it is r* once apparent that
Hawaii would be of inestimable value
as part of United States territory."
The question of annexation of Ha
waii is likely to be revived in the Sen
ate and the reasons â ' forth by Sena
tor Lodge will be one of the strongest
arguments in its favor.

Los Angeles Council Committee
Brings Up the Water Sys
tem Controversy.
LOS ANGELES, May 2.â The special committee on mountain water
supply created a sensation to-day by making the following report to
the City Council:
As more than two months have already elapsed since the report of your
special committee on mountain water supply was adopted by the Council, and
as nothing has since been done in regard to investigation of the various
propositions submitted, either as to titles of lands in question or as to the
cost of either proposition, or the. accuracy or reliability of the estimates
submitted, and as less than three months of the lease of the Los Angeles
City Water Company yet remain in which to do anything in regard to ac
quiring a supply of mountain water before the expiration of the contract
with said water company, your committee on mountain water supply beg
leave to report that they consider that the time is too short for this com
mittee to make any further investigations of sources of supply of moun
tain water. As the legal status and its attendant engineering problems have
not been investigated in due season It is useless to report upon any outside
sources of water supply.
Therefore, your committee considers that nothing of consequence can be
done at this time except to take necessary steps to assume control of the
city's plant, now leased to the Los Angeles City Water Company, upon the
expiration of said lease on the 22d of July next, and that the city water
overseer be directed to take possession of said leased water plant on said
22d of July; that he be directed to collect all water rates then and there
after; that the public at large be notified that on and after the said 22d of
July all consumers of water supplied by said water plant must pay water
rent to the city water overseer only, and that water rates on and after July
22 shall be fixed at a rate which shall be a uniform reduction of 20 per cent
from present rates.
Messrs. Guder and Hutchison asked for the adoption of the report.
Councilman Toll denounced it as a political play. It was finally re
ferred to the City Attorney for a report. The matter will probably
sleep in the City Attorney's office.
MARIN COUNTY
TEACHERS MEET
Annual Institute Opens

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, May 2.â The annual
â  institute for the teachers of Marin
! County opened to-day at 1:30 in the
afternoon in the Superior Court room
; of the County Courthouse, and opened
auspiciously, with the orgun pealing
forth its deep-toned notes in accom
i paniment of the grand old national an
them. "America," sung with a will by
a hundred voices. County Superinten
dent of Schools Robert Furlong pre
sided. Words of welcome were extend
! Ed by William J. Miller, president of
; the Board of City Trustees, and Dr. W.
; F. Jones, president of the City Board of
! Education.
Professor John F. Seaman read an
i interesting: essay on "The Daily Pro
; gramme," which was discussed after
ward by the institute. Professor Sea
man took up the subject from a
'â  psychological standpoint, and dealt
i especially with the subject of mnemo
i nics and the most scientific arrange
i ment of daily schedule so as to preserve
the vital energies of teacher as well as
pupil.
The subject of a local history club
was discussed by Professor A. C.
j Abshire, Miss Annabel McDonnell and
I Professors F. W. Wright, G. H. Boke
and W. F. Blake. Such organizations
were mentioned as existing in various
parts of the State and doing a deal of
good. Miss McDonnell elucidated the
theme at some length and outlined the
plans proposed by Mrs. Winterburn of
Stockton at the last meeting of the
State Teachers' Association.
By invitation. Professor W. W.
Stone, president of the Lincoln Monu
ment League, delivered a feeling ad
dress on the objects of the leasrue. A
neat compliment was paid the teachers
I of Marin County ft,-r the interest they
have manifested, and he closed with
the injunction to his hearers that,
though thore may be blood on the flag,
it has tended to the uplifting of hu
manity.
The day's work was concluded with
a spicy paper on "Some Elements in
the Work of a Successful Teacher," by
Hart- Wagner. He gave an outline of
the elements of success as represented
in the best teacher of New Orleans, the
best primary teacher of Cleveland,
Ohio, and the best eighth-grade teach
er in Indianapolis. The remarks were
all based on actual observation of the
work mentioned, and the institute was
left to determine what were the ele
ments of success and those of failure.
The committee on music, of which
Charles N. Watson is chairman, has
prepared a tasteful programme of
music to intersperse the liter ry fea
tures. During to-day's session the
Sprudel Quartet rendered the "North
Wind," and Mrs. W. J. Wickman and
Miss F. H. Ingalsbe piano solos.
Prior to the day's session a pleasant
reception and banquet were . tendered
to the visiting teachers in the Masonic
building by the reception committee â
Miss Edwina Dufficy, Miss J. V. Haw
kins and Professor Abshire. Four
patriotic songs were sung, "The Star-
Spangled Banner" bringing down the
house. Some of the teachers, having
just arrived, had not seen the morning
papers and a narration of the victory
of the American fleet in the Philippines
by Professor Bake excited intense en
thusiasm.
There will be a morning and after
noon session to-morrow, theprogramme
containing papers by Professors Syle
of Berkeley and Griggs of Stanford.

Regulars Detained at Dyea
and Skaguay Complain
Bitterly.
Each Incoming Vessel Besieged by
Crowds Eager for News of
trio Conflict.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, May 2.â The steamer
Islander, which returned from Skaguay ;
this morning, brought ninety passen
gers, many of whom are or. their way j
south to Join the army of the United ;
States. They say fuHy 100 if not more j
will soon fallow them, for when they
left numbers were straightening out
their affairs preparing to come south
to fight the Dons. It Is said that the !
two companies of United States In
fantry stationed at Dyea and Skaguay j
are chafing considerably over their iso- j
laticm, and bitterly complain because i
they have no chance to join those who !
go to the front.
At Skaguay news of new finds In the !
interior pales into insignificance. It j
no longer causes excitement. The sole i
topic of conversation is the war, and i
no sooner does a steamer from the '
south enter the harbor than she is sur- i
rounded by Skaguayans in small boats, !
who throng around the officers and I
passengers, begging for the latest news
of the war.
Skaguayans are very patriotic and I
every report of the success of the stars
and stripes is duly celebrated. Prac
tical jokers and circulators of false
reports are abroad at Skaguay, and
their work adds considerably to the
excitement. One of these spread a re
port a few days before the Islander
sailed that Great Britain had loaned
the American Government four war
vessels to protect New York harbor
from attack. This was received every
where with applause.
At Dyea the customs officials are still
endeavoring to suppress the sale of
liquor. A few days before the Islander
left, on April 27, six officers, acting un
der the instructions of Inspector
Mount, went to Dyea and proceeded to
seize the whisky found in the various
saloons. The raid was unsuccessful, as
the saloon-keepers, having been warned
of the coming of the officers, had hid
den their intoxicants.
But few treasure-hunters are starting
inland at present, owin~ to the unsafe
condition of the ice on the lakes and
rivers. Should the warm weather con
tinue it is thought that it wil not be
long ere the lakes and rivers are Â« tvig
able. Sheep Camp Is now almost"" de
serted. The Argonauts have nearly all
made their way over to the lakes,
where they are engaged in boat-build
ing and otherwise preparing for the
trip down the river when the ice
breaks.
The work of exhuming the bodies on
the Chilcoot Pass continues. Sixty
four had been taken out when the
Islander left.
At Wrangel the residents are making
preparations for the opening of naviga
tion on the Stickine. The warm
weather has had the effect of breaking
up the ice in many places in the river
and it is said that should the warm
weather continue for about a week the
river would be free from ice.
DID NOT EMPLOY
PETROLEUM BOMBS.
â¢WASHINGTON, May 2 âNaval men
are inclined to discredit the statement
in dispatches from Madrid to-night that
Admiral ; Dewey employed petroleum
bombs in a reduction of the city to
Manila. In f act, : no ; definite information
could be obtained that the American
squadron was supplied with : such in
struments of destruction. It is regard
ed as quite likely that in the event of a
bombardment of the city the bursting
of shells I would start > serious . fires and
perhaps s result in ; a conflagration, , but
that Admiral Dewey used bombs with
the express idea of â¢â  firing the city is
believed utterly improbable, unless he
was pressed to extreme measures,
which is not thought to have been
likely.
The belief is prevalent in official cir
cles that ; if a : fire , occurred the Spanish,
confronted by the inevitable fall of the
city, themselves applied the torch,
thereby carrying ; into effect the threat
which they have made concerning both
Manila ! and Havana, [>, that ; the ; cities
should never fall into the hands of the
Americana except a*- beaps of I smolder

Suicide of an Officer at

Despondent Because His Regi

Acted Queerly of Late and Constantly
Complained Because He Was
Kept Back.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MOBILE, Ala., May 2.â The Spring
Hill camp was distressed to-day by the
suicide of First Lieutenant Rowland
C. Hill of Company C, Twentieth In
fantry. He had been standing in front
of his tent talking to other officers and
had his revolver In his hand. As he
turned away he raised the revolver to
his head and shot himself through the
head, back of the left ear. He died in
stantly.
Lieutenant Hill had been acting
queerly for several days. His health
has not been good since he suffered
from Chagres fever in Central America
in connection with the inter-oceanic
railway. He became despondent when
the Twenty-second was ordered t-j
Tampa and was heard frequently to
mutter:
"They won't let me go; they won't
let me go."
He said he was satisfied he would not
be allowed to go to Cuba. This idea
seemed to control him and apparently
unsettled him.
He was a native of Muscatine, la.,
and graduated in 1881 at West Point.
He was promoted in 1890 and was to
have been made captain in a few days.
He was 41 years of age and leaves a
widow, now visiting her mother in Co
lumbus, O. His father was killed in the
battle of Nashville in 1564.
The funeral took place at sundown at
the camÃ, with six members of his
company as coffin bearers. The band
played a dirge and four platoons of
Company G were the escort. Then
came the hearse and following were the
officers of the regiment, followed by
other companies of the regiment with
out arms. At the confines of the camp
the leave-taking took place and then
the hearse was driven to the city. The
remains will be sent to Columbus.

PLEASED WITH
THE BATTLE
English Comment on the
Defeat of the Spaniards
at Manila.
Embassador Hay Overjoyed by
the Prowess of the Ameri-
can Navy.
Many British Naval Officers Express
the Warmest Admiration for
Dewey's Work.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, May 2.â ln the House of
Parliament, at the hotels, which are be
ginning to be full of American tourists,
at all the Government offices, and par
ticularly at the Admiralty, the brilliant
defeat of the Spanish fleet by the
Asiatic fleet of the United States at the
battle of Manila was the one subject
talked of throughout the day.
The United States Embassy was the
center of interest for all London. There
was a continuous line of callers re
questing information, the majority be
ing Americans.
The United States Embassador, Col
onel John Hay, is overjoyed at this
demonstration of the prowess of the
American navy, remarking concerning
Commodore Dewey. who is a personal
friend of the Embassador: "It is hard
to imagine so quiet and amiable a gen
tleman controlling a fierce naval battle,
It is these quiet, gentlemanly Amer
icans, however, who may be depended
upon to surprise the world when the op
portunity for making history comes in
the line of duty."
Lieutenant Cohvell, the United States
naval attache, declared the result was
merely what he expected. The hotel
bulletins are surrounded with en
thusiastic Americans, many of them
displaying miniature flags within their
buttonholes.
Many British naval officers have ex
pressed the wannest admiration for the
work of the American fleet. In fact, a
preponderance of sentiment in the Brit
ish navy seems to be with the Amer
icans throughout, the officers giving
many practical proofs of their partial
ity. International courtesy, however,
debarred the high officials from com
menting upon the result.
All the information obtainable con
cerning the Spanish force of auxiliary
cruisers, in regard to which vague re
ports have emanated from Madrid,
tends to show that it has been over
estimated. The best two ships, the Co
lumbia and the Normannia, formerly of
the Hamburg-American line, are yet
unarmed, and it is believed they will
be unable to secure armament.
The r-hief factor of the remainder of
the Spanish force of auxiliary cruisers
consists in the six steamers belonging
to the Barcelona Trans-Atlantic Steam
ship Company. They are fairly well
armed, but they have been scattered.
Two of them are with the Cape Verde
squadron, as transports; one is convoy
ing the tornedo flotilla: another, it is
said, is at Santiago de Cuba, and two
are at Cadiz.
RAILWAY ACCIDENT
IN THE TIBURON YARDS.
Brakeman James Carr Crushed "Un
der Engine Wheels and Dan
gerously Injured.
TIBURON, May 2.â James Carr, abrake
man employed on the San Francisco and
North Pacific Railroad, was seriously, and
perhaps fatally, injured last night in at
tempting to step on the pilot of an en
gine in the yards at this place. At the
time of tho accident Carr was engaged in
loading the steamship Ukiah with freight
cars. The engine commonly used in this
work broke down a few days ago, and
the big freight engine. No. 16. on the run
between Tiburon and Petaluma, v. as
brought into requisition. As the engine
moved forward the brakeman stepped
on the pilot, holding a lantern in one
hand and the other hand slipping
from its hold, he fell under the front
trucks. The wheels passed over the fleshy
part of the thigh and tore the flesh from
the bones. The chance for his recovery is
slight. .

TAMPA, Fla. May 2. â Brigadier-
Generals J. B. Wade and W. R. Shatter
received telegrams from Washington
to-night informing them that the Pres
ident would to-morrow send in their
names as major-generals of volunteers.
Both will, however, accompany the
United States troops to Cuba. It is the
general belief in army circles to-night
that the command of the expedition
will devolve on General Shafter, with
General Wade in command of the first
division, and General Coppinger of the
Second.

ON BOARD Herald-Call dispatch
boat Somers N. Smith, via Key West,
May 2.â Deep draught and shallow
water on one side and Indisposition for
a fight on the other prevented the tor
pedo boat Porter from destroying three
gunboats of the enemy. Scouting along
the coast on a roving commission, the
Porter carried her investigations to La
Boca, a small port, near Sa~ua La
Grande, in Santa Clara Province, and
on the north coast of Cuba. The bay ia
dotted with small islands, and as tho
Porter came in there yesterday after
noon her commander, Lieutenant Joha
C. Fremont, discovered two small gun
boats and an armed steam tug patrol
ling within the waters of the bay. The
Porter made a dash at her foes tha
moment they were discovered. The
Spaniards promptly fled, and Lieuten
ant Fremont, greatly to his disgust,
found that the water was too shallow
for him to follow at*the speed of tha
fugitives.
Not wishing to jeopardize his vessel
for small game the engines were slowed
down and the crews of the rapid-fire
guns were sent to quarters and
after shot was sent after the flying
Spaniards. The distance was great and
it is not known whether any of th<i
gunboats were hit or not. They were
too busily engaged in getting away to
return the fire. The only firing iho
Spaniards did was under the boilers,
and at every shot from the Porter theie
would rise a fresh cloud of smoke from
the funnels of the fugitives, tellin? of
the sudden energy of their firemen.

CORRUPTED ]Â§V THE RACES.
' I 'HE prospect that several deputies in the Coun
ty Clerk's office will be arrested for the hypothe
* cation of their salary warrants to more than one
broker is but another indication of the corrupt in
fluence of the races. Chief Deputy Piper, who is
supposed to be the principal offender, is charged with
having transferred his warrant for one month's pay
to four separate brokers, naturally leaving at least
three to lament. Others have offended almost as
grossly. The immediate result is that men receiving
comfortable salaries face the possibility of disgrace,
that their probity as officials comes naturally into
question, and that upon the money they earn, and
that which they secure in dishonorable ways, the
"bookies" are fattening.
There is hardly a day when announcement is not
made that some man, usually a young man, has gone
wrong, has betrayed a trust, has been actually steal
ing, and in a great majority of cases the races are
directly the cause. The delusion that one may be
come rich by betting on track events is a common
and fallacious one. Pursued systematically by a per
son of moderate income it is virtually certain to lead
to crime. It took Figel to jail and into the shadow
of the gallows, it sent Welburn into exile, his cashier
to a suicide's grave, it has led Widber to the gates of
the penitentiary, and now Piper and his associates are
under a cloud for the same reason. It is natural to
suppose that there are many yet who tremble in
hourly fear of exposure, that there are tales of pecu
lation still to be told, and all because the races month
after month hold out a vain promise, offer fictitious
gain, show an easy path to affluence, a path that none
has trod but which ever stretches away to beguile the
feet of the unwary.
Will the Supervisors ever check this evil? Do they
care that criminals are being made by the mock races
they permit to be maintained that there may be a
chance to bet? Races as run in San Francisco now
are merely a form of crime, a confidence game in
which the "dupe," forced to desperation, often has to
steal the stake he plays and generally loses.
According to Mr. Huntington, speaking under
oath, he never made a cent out of a Western railroad,
md the original builders of the Pacific lines all lost
money. All of which is important as showing the
devoted self-sacrifice which constructs and maintains
railways for the mere pleasure of benefiting the coun
try, and sinking at last to a degree of poverty such
as marks the declining years of Huntington himself.
The list of fatalities among the Spanish in the
Manila fight has been given from Madrid as eleven.
Considering the source, this is a surprisingly liberal
figure. Probably to multiply it by only fifty would
be an undeserved compliment to the diplomatists of
Madrid. They have in all likelihood told a bigger
lie about it than this.
There is difficulty in understanding the Panama's
surrender to the Mangrove. There seems no ap
parent reason why the captain instead of striking his
colors should not have pulled the Mangrove aboard
with a boathook and gone on his way with the value
of his cargo enhanced.
When the Spanish Minister of Marine first heard
of the little affair off Manila he told his colleagues
that he was experiencing great difficulty in suppress
ing his joyful emotions. If this is true the gentleman
is a poor analyst of emotions. What he was torn by
lacked much of being joy.
C. P. Huntington has not yet developed a tendency
to tell the Railroad Commissioners all he knows
about the Southern Pacific. He has, however, not
haggled the least as to telling them a lot of things
already as familiar to them as to him.
The Kansas editor who spoke of the national flag
as a painted rag was chased into the next county,
and would have been hanged had the people caught
him. Such an episode is almost disgraceful. The
people ought to run better.
Cubans who are arming and enlisting under Blanco
would probably rather do this than starve. After
they have had a few square meals they can skip over
to the other side and make good use of the weapons
they are getting. .
Rev. J. K. McLean states publicly that the present
war is without justification, but it is cheering to note
that even among ministers he is part of a small
minority.
The only regret that will be felt in this country over
the westward journey of the Spanish fleet is that Wey
ler is not coming along to take chances with it.
When Spain admits a defeat it is safe to say tljat
the lickjiic administered has been cosiD.letc
FOREIGN INTERVENTION.
rROM the time when first it became apparent that
the United States would put an end to Spanish
atrocities in Cuba, even at the expense of war,
there has been more or less talk of possible Euro
pean intervention. As events have iollowed one an
other the talk has increased, until now it is suggested
in more than one quarter that some combination of
European powers may intervene at any time to save
the Spanish monarchy from the overthrow which
threatens it.
The only basis on which these rumors of interven
tion rest is that afforded by the application of the
Queen Regent of Spain to various courts to use their
good offices to prevent the war. This basis, however,
is not sufficient to sustain a belief that intervention
will be seriously attempted. The statesmen of Europe
know very well that the United States would not sub
mit to their interference, and they are also aware
that intervention against our will would mean a war
which would threaten more monarchies than that of
Spain.
In the present condition of international affairs
anything like an agreement among the powers of
Europe on an issue of such magnitude as that of in
tervening between the United States and the settle
ment of the war with Spain would be impossible.
There are too many antagonisms in Europe for any
concert of action in a case of this kind. That, how
ever, is not the main point in the matter. Even if
all Europe were agreed intervention would hardly
be undertaken, for the simple reason that it could not
be successfull}' carried out.
During our Civil War three of the great nations of
Europe entered into an agreement to offer their joint
services to bring about a termination of the war.
The Ministers of those powers at Washington ar
ranged among themselves for a presentation of the
offer to Secretary Seward. The Secretary learned
beforehand what was to be done, and when the three
Ministers called in a body he excused himself from
receiving them at that time, and then notified them
separately that the United States would refuse to lis
ten to any proposition of the kind they designed to
make. That ended the incident.
A short time ago the European Embassadors at
Washington went in a solemn ceremonial body to
offer to President McKinley the offices of their Gov
ernments to assist in maintaining peace with Spain.
It will be remembered that none of them suggested
intervention. Their representation was no more than
a perfunctory formality. The President replied to it
with fitting words, that offended no one, but at the
same time gave all the world to understand that the
United States would not consent to the interference
of Europe in the controversy in any manner what
ever.
All the precedents of our history are opposed to the
interference of Europe in any way with the policy of
the United States. We have no alliance with any
European nation, no voice in any European concert,
no concern in any European affair. We have pre
served inviolate the right of freedom of action, and
that right we will maintain. We will do in this war
whatever necessity compels us to do in defense of our
cause, and when the war is over it will be settled on
whatever terms we believe the exigencies of the occa
sion call for in order to do justice to ourselves and to
the Cuban people. In no respect will European in
tervention be tolerated. Any offer to intervene would
be met with a rebuff, any attempt to force it would
mean war.
AS TO PIRACY.
WAR is war. Congress has declared it and the
President is directing the conflict. For the first
time in our history the scene of the war is in
America, Europe and Asia. Our far-scattered fleets
are in the Atlantic, the Pacific and the China sea.
They are contradicting the stories that our Jack tars
had staled in peace and that the viking spirit of slf
reliance had died in the hearts of their commanders.
When a nation takes up the sword it must smite and
be smitten. It must give and take.
The shortest road to peace is over the ruin of what
peace has wrought. Commerce is its greatest achieve
ment; commerce is the calm health of nations, and
war strikes it like a pestilence. Property is less than
life, and its destruction saves life by shortening the
struggle. For this reason all nations at war strike
at commerce. Our first blow, therefore, fell not upon
fortified cities, but upon the merchant marine of
Spain, as hers was aimed at ours. That we got the ad
vantage was not to our discredit. That she failed was
her misfortune. Each nation aimed a blow at the
ocean commerce of the other, with exactly the same
motives, as an act of war.
It is a subject of sincere regret that while no Span
iard so far has characterized this advantage of ours
as piracy, a Californian has been guilty of that indis
cretion. Judge Maguire, representing San Francisco
in Congress, after voting with the extreme war and
recognition wing of the House, flinches at the first
blow of the combat he invoked and is quoted as say
ing, in effect, that the men of our navy are pirates,
because they took prizes at sea. He should have
known that they were justified by our own articles of
war and by the international military code.
What would he have? Does he think that war
consists of a joint resolution and a speech by Bailey?
It is a new thing in politics for a member of Con
gress to vote for war and then attack the President
and the navy for carrying it on successfully. Would
he have our navy lie at Key West roasting in the sun
while the merchant fleet of Spain revictualed Havana
and recruited the war chest and arsenal of Blanco?
The President is a soldier, and, like all soldiers,
accepted war as a last resort. While he was hoping
for the best and preparing the country for the worst
Judge Maguire and the majority of his party in Con
gress were daily nagging him with abuse. Now that
he wins in every action from the beginning and that
his orders and his strategy are bringing victory from
the Antilles to the Philippines the Judge denounces
his war policy as piracy! By parity of reasoning,
when a collision between the land forces kills Span
iards the Judge should denounce Shafter as a mur
derer. Maguire will soon find his proper companion
ship with that Kansas editor who denounced the
stars and stripes as "a painted rag," and had to walk
out of town to avoid the patriotic attentions of the
people.
America has a President who can sit in the White
House and direct the movements of our navy in the
Caribbean Sea and on the coast of Asia, the march
of our armies in the tropics and the triumph of our
arms simultaneously near our coast and at the anti
podes. He is not a pirate chief, but the elect of the
American people, who propose to stand by him to the
end.
The whereabouts of the Oregon and of the Spanish
fleet seem to constitute two of the great problems of
the war. But the final whereabouts of the latter will
probably be as definite as the location of the Maine
shortly after it shall pet into the vicinity of a gentle
man named Schley or of a certain Sampson.
THE SA^ FRAXCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 3, 1898.
CALIFORNIA TO THE FRONT.
CALIFORNIANS have a right to indulge more
than ordinary State pride in the record the
commonwealth has established for itself in the
present crisis. It has been noted at Washington
that the response of California to the call for volun
teers has been prompter and more unquestioning in
its loyalty and ardor than that of any other State in
the Union.
Adjutant-General Corbin in a recent interview
spoke highly of the swiftness of California in filling
her quota of troops, and said: "California is the only
State from which no complaint about quota or dis
tribution has come. Other States have been heard
from by letter or wire, and all of them have made this
or that objection to what was required of them. Cali
fornia on the other hand has gone nobly on organ
izing and getting into shape without delay or inter
ruption."
Praise of this kind from army headquarters in an
emergency like that which confronts us is of the
highest value to a patriotic people. It is no slight
thing to have achieved distinction for willing and
prompt action in a sisterhood of States, all of whose
people are so devoted to the Union and so ready to
respond to every call to follow the flag.
The men of the National Guard and the officers in
command who have superintended the work of or
ganization of the State's quota deserve the highest
credit for winning for the commonwealth this new
and honorable prestige. They have responded to the
call of the nation with the alacrity of those patriots
whom our revolutionary fathers called "minute men."
They have not questioned, they have not found fault,
they have responded to the call of duty with the
promptness of veterans responding to the demands
of discipline.
There is much gratification in knowing that the
praise given has been well merited. The response
from every section of the State with but one excep
tion has been of the kind noted by the adjutant-gene
ral, and even in the exceptional case the National
Guard was not to blame. The dissension there was
caused by small jealousies of certain local politicians.
Fortunately this one exception was of a character too
slight to affect the State as a whole. California has
made her record of honor in the organization of the
volunteer army, and, when the time comes, we can
rely on the men who represent her to make an equally
good record on the battlefield.
RESULTS OF THE VICTORY.
DEWEY'S splendid victory in the harbor of
Manila will have important consequences not
only in hastening the end of the war, but in
determining the course of hostilities while the war
lasts. It was not a victory achieved in a battle fought
merely for the sake of fighting. It had a definite
purpose in view, and that purpose has been accom
plished.
The existence of a Spanish fleet with a good base
of supplies at Manila constituted a menace to our
shipping in the Pacific Ocean and mor: or less of a
danger to all our Pacific Coast cities. The object of
Dewey in going to Manila was to destroy that fleet
or at least blockade it and so prevent it from doing
harm to our commerce in any part of the Pacific.
Had he been a cautious and hesitating leader he
would probably have contented himself with a block
ade, but being the brave, gallant seaman that he is,
he struck at once, and not only put an end to the
Spanish fleet but made himself master of Manila,
thus gaining for us that base of supplies which was
so menacing in the hands of the enemy.
The victory virtually relieves the Pacific Coast
States of all danger of attack during the war. Pos
sibly if the conflict be prolonged some Spanish pri
vateers may cruise along the coast, but this is not
likely, and even if it occurred the danger would not
be great. With the Spanish fleet in the Pacific de
stroyed and Manila in our hands the whole of this
part of the world is practically safe from molestation
by any form of Spanish attack.
In addition to these direct effects the victory will
no doubt have further effects by its influence upon
both ourselves and the Spaniards. There can be no
doubt that Dewey's splendid feat will rouse the emu
lation of the officers and seamen of the fleet in the
Atlantic, and they will be eager to rival it by as bril
liant a deed in the capture of Havana, For this pur
pose, however, the impatient men in the fleet along
the Cuban coast will have to wait the coming of
the Spanish fleet that is now supposed to be on its
way across the Atlantic. It is impossible to fight a
fleet until it has been found and brought into range.
Dewcy was fortunate in finding the Spaniards of the
Orient in a position where they could not get away.
On this side of the globe we must perforce wait a
while.
Whether considered in regard to its daring tactics
or with respect to its results the victory at Manila
will rank among the greatest in the annals of naval
warfare. It has shown that our seamen ha\'e the
courage to fight warships and land batteries and forts
combined, that they have the coolness to maneuver
their ponderous ironclads under fire, that the aim of
their gunners is as true in battle as at target prac
tice; and in addition it has freed one-half the seas of
the globe from the menace of Spain. All this was a
glorious achievement and fitly celebrated the May
day of war.
The blockade of both Havana and Manila at the
same time will have the effect of demonstrating to
smokers that there is such a thing as getting Manila
and Havana cigars from Connecticut without se
riously altering the established tobacco industry of
that State.
Weyler has been trying to justify his rule in Cuba,
but it may fairly be said he has not done so. If
Weyler is sincere in his professed beliefs he is so
curious a pervert that in the interests of science a
post-mortem should be performed on him.
Efforts to break the news gently to Madrid did not
have the effect of soothing the savage breasts that are
numerous thereabouts. The gentleman to whom fell
the difficult and delicate office should have employed
a long-distance telephone.
From the present outlook the war will probably not
be much more than a prolonged target practice and
exercise in prize chasing.
There is no doubt but a feeling of confidence would
be inspired by the presence in this harbor of a fleet
of torpedo boats.
The opportunity to go up in a balloon just now
would be a strong temptation to a member of the
Sagasta Cabinet.
Word has not been received as to how many mules
were killed in Manila, but in all likelihood there were
at least two.
The Spanish had evidently been misled by the ease
with which they achieved victory over the Maine.

"COAIMENCE FIRING."
Signal for United States Warships at
Opening of Battle-
COMMANDER DEWEY, whose name
and praise are on every American lip
to-day, won applause from naval
chieftains In the Civil War, and Ad
miral Porter, in referring to the conduct of
Captain Smith and Lieutenant Dewey in
connection with the destruction of the
Mississippi, remarked: "It is in such try
ing moments that men show of what
metal they are made, and in this instance
the metal was of the very best." The
Mississippi, with Dewey second In com
mand, served at the passage of the forts
below New Orleans and in the destruction
of the Confederate ram Manassas. In
March, 1863, while attempting to pass the
batteries at Fort Hudson, the Mississippi
grounded in twenty-three feet of water
and heeled to port. In spite of every effort
of her officers and drew, she could not be
moved. The enemy got the range and
were hulling her at every shot. At last
the order was given to fire the ship.
When the flames had obtained sufficient
headway the ship was abandoned under
a most heavy fire, and Captain Smith and
Lieutenant Dewey, who had made the
vessel so efficient, were the last to leave
the burning wreck. The action was ap
proved by Admiral Farragut and the
Navy Department. The Mississippi, by
the way, had borne Perry's broad pennant
at the opening of Japan to the world,
and was a splendid vessel, but her destruc
tion was unavoidable. The fine qualities
of Dewey as an officer were brought forth
then in a marked degree. Thirty-five years
have passed since the Mississippi epi
sode, and now Rear-Admiral Dewey has
proved his title clear to a place in his
country's temple of fame alongside of
the Joneses, the Decaturs, the Perrys, the
Cushings, the Wordens and thr> Farragnts.
A brief sketch of Rear-Admiral Dewey's
life appeared in yesterday's Call. There

EXPERT OPINION OF THE SPAN

Here Is a passage from Macaulay, which
American commanders and soldiers should
remember, for it will apply to Cuba,
under Spanish rule, as well as to Spain:
"There is no country in Europe which it
is so easy to overrun as Spain; there is no
country in Europe which it is more dilll
cult to conquer. Nothing can be more con
temptible than the regular military re
sistance which Spain offers to an invader;
nothing more formidable than the energy
whtrh she puts forward when her regular
military resistance has been broken down.

being poniarded."â Philadelphia Ledger.
RESPONSE TO THE CALL FOR COUN
TRY.
Judging by the enthusiasm everywhere
displayed, there will be less difficulty In

Hypothecated His Warrant to as
Many as Four Different
Money=Lenders.
Said to Be Going the "Widber Pace."
Grand Jury May Act â Arrests
Threatened.
Harry Piper, chief deputy under
County Clerk Curry, has got himself
and several other deputy county clerks
into a serious tangle with the money
brokers. Auditor Hroderick has been
bo exercised over the carrying on of
these men that he is seriously consider
ing the advisability of bringing their
actions to the attention of the Grand
Jury, and one of the brokers yesterday
threatened to have three of the deputy
clerks arrested to-day.
The trouble is over the hypothecation
of salary warrants. In one case Piper
. hypothecated one of his warrants to no
less than four different brokers. This
was the warrant for February. The
warrants for March and April have
each been hypothecated to three differ
; ent money-lenders, riis salary is $250 a
month. By his peculiar method of fln
; anciering he succeeded in raising $ISOO
on $750 worth of securities. But this
. was done without the knowledge or
consent of the brokers concerned.
Hence there is much anguish among
. those latter gentry.
According to common report all of the
proceeds have gone to swell the profits
of the â "bookies." In other words, it is
said that Piper has been "going the
V. idber pace." This Piper denies, and
claims that the money went to pay ex
penses in his family caused by illness.
It is further charged that not content
with what he secured by the manipu
lation of his own demands upon the city
treasury, he induced three of the depu
ties in the County Clerk's office to make
double assignments of their warrants,
and also "blew in*' the proceeds of
these on the race track.
Pipers salary for February was hy
pothecated to F. L. Carpenter, S.
Kampe. F. Smith and J. Olsen. t >lsen
rehypothecated it with the Columbian
Hanking Company. When the latter
ascertained on the representation of the
assignment of the warrant to the Audi
tar that the same warrant had been as
signed to others, they forced Olsen to
make good the amount, and Olsen in
turn compelled Piper to satisfy his
â¢â¢â¢"r claim, so that at the present time there
, .. are only three claimants'to the Febru
ary warrant. The March warrant is as
: : . sigwd.to J. Boas, F. Smith and S.
Kampe. The April warrant is assigned
â¢ â  to 'the same three brokers.
From Kampe Piper obtained $550,
â¢â ;; /from . Smith $500, from Boas $500 and
-* .from -Carpenter $250.
â¢ v Auditor Broderick will refuse to pay
any "f these warrants until there is but
one cJaimant to each. He states that it
is a matter that the brokers and Piper
: ivni have to sertle among themselves j
Among the other offenders are depu
. ties Thomas L. Doran, V. F. Northrop
Â Jarrtes B. Barber and H. Barron. The
March warrants of Doran, Northrop
and Barber, for $150 each, were as

According to the statement of North
. ro-p the transactions were carried on
'. by Piper, who received the proceeds
from their hypothecation. According
.. to Xnrthmp's explanation the hypothe
. cation. was first made with Smith. Then
the assignments were sold to Boas, the
latter being told tha: the warrants as
signed to him were among those that
â¢ had been held out on the suit brought
by Mayor Phelan to enjoin the Auditor
from paying certain of the deputies'
salaries. For this reason Boas did not
file his assignments with the Auditor
. -until last Friday. Meanwhile Smith had
Obtained the warrants and drawn the
money called for by them. Northrop
. stated that he .as induced to make the
-.. second assignment on the representa
tion of Piper that the latter had paid
Smith's claim and had withdrawn the
Smith assignment from the Auditor's
office.
IJ. ilarron, another deputy, is on rec
ord as having assigned one of his war
rants to J. Boas and also to S. Kampe.
. Broker Kampe is indignant but philo
sophical, over the manner in which he
has been treated.
"I loaned Mr. Piper some money," he
Bald, "and he gave me a number of as
signments as security for the amount.
He made no statement to me as to what
he did with other brokers. It is a dis
honorable act and no man of honor
would do anyt..ing of that kind. As the
matter now stands he cannot draw any
of his warrants until the claims of all
the brokers are satisfied."
Mr. Kampe is a member of the Grand
Jury. He was asked if he intended to
bring the matter before the inquisitorial
body. He replied: "I would not bring
any of my business before the Grand
Jury. I would rather be me sufferer
than do anything of that kind." Con
tinuing he said:
"I had no knowledge of his intend
ing to assign his warrants to any other
broker. If I had known he intended to
do so, he would not have got the loan
from me. I have two rules that I
strictly observe. On is that persons do
ing business with me must not do busi
ness with any other broker. The other
is that I will not loan money to a man
who drinks. When I went to collect the
warrant and was unable to do so, Mr.
Piper came to me and told rae he was
hard up and asked for time. Under the
circumstances I could do nothing else
than grant his rrquest. What good
would it have done if I had made
trouble for him?"

; among those that hud been held out for
i the purpose of the test suit brought by
! the Mayor. lie stated that his inform
i ant on this point was Harry Piper.
! When he learned that as a matter of
; fact the warrants had been drawn, and
> that his assignments had been filed too
late, he declared that if this was the
case he would have the three deputies
arrested to-day.
Harry Piper made a poor simulation
|of nonchalance when he was informed
of the "hot time" that was probably in
store for him. He said that he owed
these people money, and that when his
salary was tied up by the suit of the
Mayor, he had given assignments of his
: warrants to protect the brokers, who
I had previously made the loans without
; exacting any security. He at first
j denied that he had obtained the money
!on the double hypothecation of the
I warrants of Doran, Northrop and Baker,
â  but afterward admitted that these men
: had let him have the money which was
! thus obtained. He denied that he had
I negotiated the double hypothecation of
the warrants. He also denied that the
I money had been lost in playing the
; races, but claimed that sickness in his
i family had recently put him to an ex
j pense of between $1000 and $1500.
Mr. Northop, who is in charge of the
j Probate Department in the County
I Clerk's office, stated last evening that
: he was one of the unfortunate deputies
! who drew their warrants ahead. He
| did it to accommodate Mr. Piper, with
j the understanding that the warrants
! were to be redeemed within ten days.
1 He stated that as this was doce two
months ago and Mr. Piper has not car
\ ried out his agreement, he and not the
'â  deputies are to blame; that if he could
i not redeem the warrants he should
have informed the deputies and thus
given them a chance to set themselves
I straight. Mr. Northop further said
that it was an injustice to use the
I names of the deputies in connection
with the matter. He said that 6lnce he
has been in the office his actions have
been above board and always before
the public.
THE NEW CHARTER.
The Merchants' Association Sounds
Its Members on It.
The men who framed the new charter
have decided to hold a meeting on Thurs
day evening in Native Sons' Hall for the j
purpose of ratifying- the charter in its en
tirety. At this gathering ways and means ;
will be discussed looking to the adoption j
of the charter by the people. The char- \
ter has been a matter of some concern !
to the members of the Merchants' Assocla- i
tion. Many of its principal officials have |
spent time and money in creating some- i
thing to take the place of the old con- !
solldation act under which the city is now
governed, but their efforts were mure as ,
I individuals than as members.
There is now a strong desire to learn
how the majority of the members stand
on the subject. To this end postals have
been sent out to all on the association's
roll asking if they favor the adoption of
the charter, and If they believe the Mer
chants' Association should urge its adop
tion. So far about one-third of the mem
bers have answered. Of these 236 are for
it, seven against and two have not made
up their minds. Efforts are being made
to learn how the remaining two-thirds
stand before the association takes any
position in the premises.
LITIGATION EXPENSES.
The Southern Pacific Railroad Com
pany Wins Its Suit Against the
Atlantic and Pacific.
The United States Circuit Court of Ap
peals yesterday affirmed the judgment of
the Circuit Court for the Southern
District of California in the case
of the United States Trust Company

Atlantic- and Pacific Railroad "Com
pany and the Southern Pacific Railroad

SB3 74, the proportion of taxes ctelmed to
be due from the Atlantic and Pacific to
the Southern Pacific Railroad Company
for the fiscal year IRS7-IRSB, expenses, etc.,
incurred in contesting and litigating taxes
for that year.
One Year in Jail.
Edward Kelly was yesterday sentenced
to one year in the County Jail by Judge
Joachimsen, being six months on each of
two charges of petty larceny. Kelly has
for two or three years back been victim
izing business houses by representing him
self as agent for an Oakland firm, and
he has served terms both here and in
Coluaa for doing so. He was one of the
Kelly brothers who had a dry-goods store
on Sixth street three or four years ago
and failed.
Widber's Horses Ordered Sold.
Judge Hunt made an order yesterday
directing the Sheriff of San Francisco
County and the Sheriff of Alameda Coun
ty to sell the running horses San Ramon,

they were attached by the city.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 3, 1898.
CALIFORNIA
TROOPS MAY
GO TO MANILA
Bright Prospects of Active Service
in Co-operating With Com=
modore Dewey.
Muster of Volunteers Will Soon Begin.
Duty In Sight for the Naval
Reserve.
The scenes at the National Guard head
quarters yesterday were exceedingly lively.
All the prominent officers of the Guard re
ported during the day, and many of them
transacted an immense amount of routine
business.
The Governor, when seen at headquar
ters yesterday by a Call representative,
said: "The National Guard is now ready
and prepared. Its maximum strength is
about 5000 men. There will be seventeen
companies that will be excluded under the
call for troops, and these -will form the
nucleus of a new Guard, that will, no
doubt Lie rapidly recruited. In fact, there
will be some men in each company who
will be unable to go, and these wil form
the nucleus of a new company, for every
one that goes into the service.
"Were the Government to desire it,
California could easily furnish twice the
number of men called for by the Presi
dent."
The Governor expresed himself as hav
ing no fears regarding the loyalty of the
Spanish-Americans and Mexicans of the
State. He also approves of and thinks the
idea of properly equipping the police of
the city for a sort of home guard in -case
of emergency is an excellent idea.
Major J. W. F. Diss of San Bernardino
the inspector of the First Brigade, re
ported to General Barrett at headquar
ters yesterday morning. lie held a long
conference with the adjutant general, but
refused to divulge the nature of the busi
ness that required hia presence here.
Major Diss has only recently completed
an inspection of the entire First Brigade,
and he reports that General Last's com
mand is in excellent shape and prepared
for immediate service in the field. The
major will remain In the city for several
days. He says the soldier boys of the
Southern part of the State are eager and
anxious to go to the front, and that they
will be greatly disappointed if they do
not see servi< -i-.
In addition to the previous applications
that have been filed from the medical
officers of the National Guard, who de
sire to serve the Government, dispatches
were received at headquarters yesterday
from the following officers of the differ
ent medical corps tending their services to
Governor Budd: Charles D. Ball, major
ana surgeon of the Seventh Infantry;
W. W. Itr.blee, assistant surgeon of the
Seventh Infantry; P. L. Rusuell, surgeon
of the Sixth Infantry, and C. A. Rodgers,
assistant surgeon of the Sixth Infantry.
Innumerable dispatches were also re
ceived from prominent officers of the
Guard tendering their services, and these
were placed on file with those that have
already been received.
One of the chief topics of discussion at
headquarters yesterday was furnished by
The Call's special war bulletin announc
ing: the probability that the National
Guard may be ordered to the Philippines.
In event of such being the rase the Cali
fornia troops will be selected because of
their nearness- to the islands and the fact
that they are prepared to move at a mo
ment's notice. The mere prospect has
caused much excitement and speculation
among the officers and men of the Guard,
who are only too anxious to help share in
the glory of holding: the Philippines.
General Barrett said it would be the
most practicable thing the Government
could possibly do, to send the California
troops to the support of Admiral Dewey.
They could be moved with less expense
than troops from any other section of the
country because they are practically as
sembled at the point of embarkation. It
will require about three weeks to trans
port the troops to Manila.
Captain Carrington indorses the Idea
and thinks that the sending .of the Cali
fornia troops to the Philippines would be
both a wise and excellent move upon the
part of the Government. In event of the
Guard being sent there is hardly any
doubt but that Captain Carrington will
accompany them.
Benjamin Birdsall, a retired commis
sary sergeant of the regular army, has
applied to Lieutenant Cloman, who has
been detailed us acting quartermaster
and commissary of subsistence, to be ap
pointed commissary sergeant. He has
had thirty years' service in the United
States army.
Mayor M. P. Snyder of Los Angeles was
at headquarters yesterday, and held a
conference with the adjutant-general. It
was given out that his visit was purely
for the purpose of attending to private
business, but it is believed that the Mayor
came to see about having steps taken to
ward preparing defenses for the south.
Captain Carrington received a dispatch
from the "War Department yesterday af
ternoon, instructing him to purchase sup
plies for the volunteers as they are mus
tered in. He is empowered to purchase
the necessary supplies without advertis
ing for them, as is generally required.
The dispatch further instructed Captain
Carrington to report progress made in
mustering in the Guard. This report is to
be made every evening at G o'clock. Prom
this it would appear that the War Depart
ment thought that Captain Carrington
had received his orders for the commence
ment of the muster, or evidently it knows
he may receive them at any moment.
Colonel Guthrie of Sacramento, com
manding the Second Regiment, was at
headquarters during the afternoon, and
saw the Go%*ernor and General Barrett.
He reported the Second with nine com
panies recruited up to the maximum re
quirement, and stated I ' that he could easily
raise the three companies necessary to
m.ake a regiment of twelve companies.
One of these could be organized on a few
hours' notice at Willows and the other at
Auburn. The Second is eager to be mus
tered into the service and is prepared to
move at any time.
It is known that the Government has
made an appropriation for the subsistence
of the Guard when it is called out to be
mustered into service. They will be fed
by the day under < Government contract.
Colonel T. M. UcCormlck of Honduras,
a wealthy and influential citizen, who for
ten years was in the artillery service in
Honduras, was at headquarters yester
day and offered his services to General
Barrett. Colonel McCormick is a native
'of New Tork. He reports that the people
! of Central America generally are in sym
pathy with the Americans.
One of the most important announce
ments marie at headquarters yesterday
! was the official statement by Gener.il
Barrett that the applications for the vol
unteer service n mounted to 50,000, and of
1 fiiis number 40,000 were filed in his office ]
, at Sacramento by April so, the remainder j
having been received since then. Tho !
recapitulation of app4ications for volun- |
! teer service given out by General Barrett j
\is as follows: Number of companies, 110; I
number of battalions, sixteen; number of I
regiments, five; number of brigades, two; I
number of batteries, three; estimated :
i number of men, 40.000; number of chap
; lams tendering services, ten, number of
, veterinary Burgeons, one, and number of
doctors, forty-live.
NATIONAL GUARD.
Work of Mustering in Vol
unteers May Begin
To=Morrow.
The National Guard of California has
but a few hours' existence as a State mill
' tary organization remaining to it. In less
than forty-eight hours there Is every
; probability that the work of mustering in
! the soldiers will have commenced, and
I they will become Uncle Sam's Instruments
of war.
Late last night Governor Budd received
â  the following official letter from the War
; Department confirming the dispatch he
: received several days ago:
War Department,
WASHINGTON, AprtJ zo, 189 S.
To the Governor <7i Californiaâ Sir: Under
the act of Congress "to provide for temporar
ily Increasing the military establishment of the
United States In time of war, , and for other
purposes," approved April 22. is<<\ and calling
for 125,000 volunteers, by direction of the Presi
i dent, I have the honor to request you to pro
vide from your State the quota of volunteers
as follows: Two (2) regiments and two (2)
battalions of infantry, and four (4) heavy bat
teries, to serve in the arms of service destfT
nated, for the period of two years, unless
sooner discharged. Attached will be found a
statement shov- â â - the organization for artil
lery, cavalry and Infantry.
1" lease cause the adjutant-general of the
army to be informed of the time your quota
will be at its rendezvous, as it will be met
i as soon as practicable thereafter by an officer
to muster It Into service and pay of the United
States. The mustering ofllcer will be instruct
ed to receive no man, who is over 45 or under
; IS, or who Is not in physical strength and
â  vigor. As soon as mustered into the United
States service. It is the Intention that troops
! from your State shall be assembled with others
i for Instruction and service under the direction
of the major-general commanding the army at
some point or points to be designated here
after. It Is desirable for reasons stated in
telegram of this date that as far as practi
cable, the National Guard be given preference.
The rendezvous for â¢ your - State will be San
] Francisco. If, from any cause, It Is found nec
essary to change point of concentration, your
recommendation is requested. Bands ; may 'be
I organized from the strength of regiments as
! in the regular army, ; viz.: See paragraph 245,
army regulations, 1*9.". Very respectfully,
R. A. ALGER, Secretary of War.
All that now remains, since everything
Is In readiness, Is to wait until Captain
Carrington receives the mustering blanks
and his detailed instructions. These were
mailed from the War Department on
Friday, and should reach here to-day or
to-morrow. Immediately after they have
been received by Captain Carrington he
will notify the Governor that he is ready
and the work of mustering in the Guard
will begin.
NAVAL MILITIA.
Plans for Rendezvous of
the Reserve Men of
California.
There Is now absolutely no doubt
that the naval militia will soon be called
into the service of the Government. The
probability of such being the fact has al
ready been published in The Call.
The following letters, which explain
themselves, wore received at headquarters
lute last night:
Navy Department,
Office i.f Asf-istant Secretary,
"WASHINGTON. I). C., April 27, IS9B.
Sir: The department Is in receipt of your
telegram of April 26, in which you ask If it
can give you any Information as to the proba
bility of the California Naval Militia's services
being required sunn, and stating that the ofli
cers and men are ready and willing. In ifâ
ply, you are Informed that plans are being
considered for rendezvousing the Naval Militia
at certain points preparatory for sorvtce. At
present the attention of the department is
taken up almost entirely with the Atlantic and
gulf coast;;, as beinsr most liable to be at
tacked. As soon as the services of the Naval
Militia are required you will be informed by
telegraph. Very respectfully,
T. ROOSKVKI.T, Assistant Secretary.

ment. â 
It is required that you furnish the depart
ment, as soon as practicable, with the names
Of such officers of the Naval Militia who de
sire to receive acting appointments In the
United States navy, and with the proposed
rank to which they should be assigned, In or
der that - acting appointments may be Issued

From the letter of Assistant Secretary
Roosevelt It will be seen that the naval

Kirkland will in no way affect any of the
naval militia who may desire to enlist In
the United States navy without waiting
to be called upon.
THE ARTILLERISTS.
More Than the Required
Number Have Already
Volunteered.
Signatures to the heavy artillery rolls
have now reached 443. and to-day It Is
expected that the 500 mark, or close to
It, will be reached. The call was for 400,
but it is expected that at least twenty
five per cent will be rejected for one
cause or another, and so the rolls will
be kept open until 500 men have signed.

JOY AT THE
ARMY POSTS
Enthusiasm Over Commo
dore Dewey's Great
Naval Victory.
News of Commodore Dewey's splendid
' victory at Manila filled the hearts of the
Presidio soldiers with joy. The great
naval achievement was the chief topic of
conversation yesterday all along the line
from Fort Mason to Fort Point. The en
; listed men were as happy as the officers,
! and the troopers of the Fourth Cavalry
' were fully as enthusiastic as the men of
the Third Artillery. Every item of intel
â â  ligence coming over the wires was eagerly
1 awaited, and predictions were made that
one more triumph of equal magnitude
would practically bring to a close the war
with Spain. It seemed to be the judg
! ment of army people that the fleets of
Sampson and Schley should pounce upon
the Spanish armada from Cape Verde as
! soon as it came within range.
Colonel Miller, Third United States Ar
: tillery, the commander of the artillery
defenses of San Francisco Harbor, had a
j busy day yesterday. lie was at Fort
i Point early In the day and later on vis
ited the fortifications at Lime Point. He
received many dispatches from General
Merriam and the engineers, and dictated
replies to First lieutenant Morris K.
Barroll, Third Artillery adjutant. Major
David 11. Kinzie, field efflcer, is in charge
! of the forces on the tented field of Fort
I Point. Major Frank \V. Hess also holds
an important command on the main line
The sergeant and five men of the United
' States Engineer Corps, whose departure
from Willets Point for San Francisco was
mentioned a low days ago in the dis
patches from New York, -arrived here yes
terday. Colonel Morris, commanding the
post at the Presidio, provided quarters
and rations for the detachment. Major
lieuor of the Engineer Corps was at once
advised of the arrival of the men. It is
no secret that these men from Willets
Point will at once begin the work of
lili'nting torpedoes and submarine mines
in the bay. The work is well advanced
In its general scope. The torpedo ma
ti rial stored at CJoat Island is at hand.
Much of the preliminary work of the
electricians has been done, yet some ex
! pert manipulation Is required to render
. the system available for immediate use.
Batteries of rapid-fire guns are In posi
tion to protect the mine field.
Orders have been received at depart
i ment headquarters directing that the vol
i unteers when mustered into the United
i States service shall be rationed the same
as regular troops. Instructions to this
effect have been .communicated to the
commissary officers of the regular army.
To-day the band of the Third Artillery
i will come from Angel Island and occupy
the quarters at the Presidio recently va
cated by the band of the First United
States Infantry.

Cavalry recruiting officer at the Presidio,
applied to be relieved from other duty, as
it required all his time to attend to the
affairs of the recruiting office. Twenty
applicants for enlistment were in line at
the Presidio when the office opened for
business yesterday morning.
Two men were "fired" from the reser
vation yesterday. One was a drunken
citizen and the other a three-time deserter
from the army who wanted to enlist in
the Fourth Cavalry. lie was recognized
as a man who deserted from Captain
Gale's troop of the Fourth Cavalry in
Arizona. Colonel Morris questioned the
man, and ascertained that he had de
serted from the Sixth Cavalry while a
squadron of that regiment was on duty
in New York during the reception of LI
Hung: Chang. Th* old deserter's name is
Kearney. The reasons he gave for his
former desertions were so flimsy that Col
onel Morris and Captain Gale advised him
to leave the reservation at once. He ob
tained a day's rations and went away.

RACING CLOSED
AT INGLESIDE
A Moderate-Sized Crowd
Swelled Balboa Bou
levard Fund.
The Downfall of Won't Dance
Was a Stunning Sur
prise.
Recreation Scored Â«n Easy Win.
Light Fields and Four Beaten
Favorites.
Tt could hardly be Bald that Ingleside
track closed its gates on the racing sea
son yesterday in a blaze of glory. The
weather was cold, the card an extremely
light one, and only the regulars turned
out. However, the Balboa boulevard
fund, for whose benefit the racing was
conducted, must have received quite a
substantial amount.
Notwithstanding the paucity of entries,
it was not all pig tails and hominy for the
favorites, four of the, choices having their
pictures turned toward the wall.
The wise division to a man fell all In
a bunch over the result of Uie 1750 mile
and a quarter "special," with but three
starters. Everybody wanted Won't
Dance at 3 to 5, and the Corrigan mare
finished last. Twinkler, the outsider in
the betting, ridden by Dick Clawson, was
allowed to make the running, and when
it came to the drive at tne end the favor
ite couldn't make it and Thorpe's groggy
finish astride Morelllto permitted the de
spised one to win by a very scant length
in 2:10. The ring laid 6 to 1 about the
winner.
After having proven a disappointment
on numerous occasions, Hohenlohe at last
escaped from the maiden class just as
everybody played Major Hooker for a
good thing. Three to one was laid against
the brown colt and he beat Hooker out
by over three lengths. Joe Mussle man
aged to take the show. v; : v
The mile purse run proved an easy
thing for Recreation, the crack lilly from
the Burns and Waterhouse string. With
but 91 pounds up, 3 tv 5 looked a liberal
price. O'Connell stayed with her for six
furlongs and then she galloped in, almost
pulled to a walk. Zarro, a 250 to 1
chance, caught the tiring O'Oonnell, lead
ing him out for the place. :v r ,
Four lined up in the mile and a quarter
selling event, with Miller and Blazer's
chestnut horse San Marco ruling a 7 to
10 cnoice. i'iggot sailed away in front
with him and he won all the way, leading
Tulare over the line under wraps. I reach
erv downed Del Paso for the show.
the Corrigan filly, Daisy F, repeated
her handy win of Saturday in the mile
selling run. Second choice to Don Luis
in the betting, she came from behind in
the run home, defeating the favorite with
the utmost ease in 1:42%. Rio Frlo, a 100
to 1 shot, well ridden by a stable boy
named Langford, landed in the show.
An uncertain lot went to the post in the
final mile run, and the betting was ex
tremely nervous, finally resulting in The
Dragon being sent to the post favorite. A
poor start ruined his chances. Thorpe,
astride the old mare Fortuna, led to the
stretch, where Hennessy gradually got
up with Claudius, and driving hard, beat
Stentor out a head.
"POL.YCL.INIC " DAY.
Oakland Track Will Reopen To-DÂ«y
With a Great Card of Run
ning Events
The reopening of Oakland track this after
noon will be celebrated by a benefit tendered,
to the San Francisco Polycllnlc. The cause is
a most worthy one, and as the ladles con
nected with the Folyclinic have labored earn
estly the past few weeks in disposing of
tickets, it is expected that an immense crowd
will be in attendance.
The "regulars" will be augmented by a gath
ering of society, and the California Jockey Club
has endeavored to make the racing card a most
attractive one. In addition to the ordinary
purse and Belling events, a race for gentlemen
riders has been arranged, the crack horseman
and pet of society, Walter liobart. having the
mount on the handicap horse, Joe Vllman. The
Policlinic Handicap, too, should prove a very
fetching- feature, calling out as it does a great
field of starters, among them the Burns Handi
cap winner. Satsuma, and the black "Hindoo"
from Montana. Ostler Joe.
The pick of the riding talent now here, which
will Include "Jester" i'iggott, Charley Thorpe,
Henry Shields, who piloted Satsuma to victory
in the Burns Handicap, Lonnie Clavton, Johnny
Wood*. Mike Ilennessy and Dick Claw-son, will
be on hand, and the knights of the pigskin
have all generously agreed to donate their
earnings in winning and losing mounts to the
fund.
Racing will commence at 2:15 p. m., and
boats will cross the bay every half hour. The
usual admission fee of $1 will be charged, and
on this occasion complimentary badges will
not be honored at the gate.
Starter CaMwell departed for the East last
evening. The veteran sprung the barrier on
five fields and then left for town to catch the
train. Kd Corrigan tried his hand at Bending

RACING STEWARDS ACT.
Owner Tom Cooke Ruled Off
Ingleside Track.
The board of stewards of the Pacific
Coast Jockey Club met last evening at
the Palace Hotel and took action in the
cases of two horsemen. The suspension
of Jockey Eddie Ames, suspended for a
ride on Montallade some days ago, wad
placed to expire on May 21.
Turn Cooke, owner of Chihuahua and
Break o' Day, was ruled off Ingleside
track under Turf Congress rule lob.
Cooke's troubles date from the time of
his claiming the horse Chihuahua, owned
by Kd Corrigan, from a selling race at
Ingleside on April 26. Cooke started
Break o1o 1 Day in the race. Among the
other starters was imported Mistral,
owned by J. B. Earnshaw. The latter
horseman made a deposition before a
notary public that he was approached by
Cooke and asked to "stand in" on a run
up and they could both make some coin.
Earnshaw would not enter into the prop
osition and Cooke, according to the rul
ing, stands ruled off all Turf Congress
tracks. __^_______â â
EDWAEDS DAVIS
HAS A REPBIEVE.
The Christian Ministers Still Amend
ing Their By-Laws.
The Christian Ministers, in meeting
yesterday, referred the amending of the
by-laws to a special committee consist
ing of W. C. Gardner, F. S. Ford and P.
G. Mclver, who will make their final re-
port next Monday.
The Edwards Davis case was only re
ferred to in a general way. It being un
derstood that no definite action will be
taken to drop his name as a charter mem
ber of the Chrititia.ii Ministers' Associa
tion until the by-laws are in a shape to
sustain the association's action.
The amendment which has been pro
posed, and which is now before the com
mittee, is as follows:
When any. member of this association shall
be charged with unchristian conduct, and the
church with which he is connected fails, for
any cause, to investigate said charges for the
purpose of establishing the Innocence or guilt
of said member, then this association shall
select a committee of three members, of some
congregation other than that of which the ac
cused Is a member. The members of said com
mittee shall proceed to investigate the charges
against the said member, and upon their
recommendation Ills name shall be dropped
from or retained upon our roll of members. â >

NEW LEAGUE
FAIRLY STARTED
Baseball of the Best Will
Now Be Offered at
Recreation Park.
All Differences Are Dissolved
in a New Board of
Officers.
The Fans May Now Expest Some
Lively Contestsâ Sunday's
Schedule.
By Joe Corbett.
'rhe first meeting of the consolidated
baseball leagues where anything was
really accomplished was held in Presi
dent Bert's offices last night. The follow
ing officers were permanently elected:
Hon. Eugene F. Bert, president; J. J.
Rawer, vice-president; Theo. F. Bonnet,
treasurer; H. Slivens, secretary; execu
tive committeeâ F. H. Swanton of Santa
Cruz, D. J. Crowley of Athletics, W. J.
Hennesy of Sacramento, W. J. Weston of
San Jose.
It was decided to call the new league
the Paciiic Coast Baseball League.
The selection of the grounds brought
forth the first burst of eloquence, and for
a while it seemed as if all would end in a
lizzie. After muny heated arguments on
both sides it was linally agreed that all
games should be played at Recreation
Park, it being far the superior at Central
Park as a ball ground. The league now
controls, with the Sixteenth and Folsom
street grounds, the three most desirable
ball parks in town.
The task of preparing a schedule was
referred to J. H. Stapleion, who was
elected "official scorer," the following
schedule being arranged for next Bunoay:
Ban Francisco vs. San Jose, at Sun
Francisco; Gilt Edges vs. Fwinos, at
Sacramento; Stockton vs. Oakland, at
Oakland; Santa Cruz vs. Athletics, at
Santa Cruz.
A bond of $500 is to be exacted from all
clubs, conditioned for carrying out the
schedule on their part during the season.
Representatives of the various clubs of
the league were present, overflowing with
suggestions of every description, and al
together, taking into consideration the
number that had to be reconciled, it was
a glorious ending to a meeting which for
a while seemed as though It must end
in uncertainty. The new league prom
ises some great ball, as much rivalry was
evidenced among the managers regard
ing the respective playing abilities of
their teams. No amount of money is to
be spared in making this new league a
"howling" success, and if ("allfornians
really want to see good baseball the time
has arrived for them to show their ap
preciation of all this new league is do
ing by turning out, not in ones or twos,
but in thousands.
HOW SHARKEY SAYS
HE WILL FIGHT
Go Right at His Man and Fin
ish the Game in Quick
Order.
BÂ«tting Is 1O to 7, With Jeffries
a Very Strong and Active
Favorite.
Tickets for the big fight on Friday
evening are now selling like hot cakes.
Every lover of pugilistic sport who in
tends to witness the contest has applied
lor a goÂ«Kl vantage position, but those
who will apply later for seats need not
fear being shut out, as the director-gen
eral of the Pavilion seating arrangements
has raised each row of seats so the spec
tators on the far end can see every point
of the game.
Of course the people who will have good
opera classes or Held glasses will have
an advantage over other Bpectatora seat
ed a good distance from the ringside.
When Sharkey was asked yesterday
what he thought of the betting, which is
now $10 to $7 with Jeffries on the long
end, he replied that betting will not win
any man a light, and so tar as he was
directly concerned he did nut care a snap
how the gambling went.
"Possibly Jeffries may have a greater
number of betting friends than I." said
Sharkey, "but you can chalk down this
for me: AVlien the fiuht is over my
friends who will play me to win can
safely count upon cashing their checks,
and that's no lie either. Of all men I
have fancied a scrap with Jeffries is the
most acceptable. Ever since the talk of ;i
match between us came up i made up my
mind that lie was just the kind of game
1 could easily capture. VVhy, all those
other fellows ran away irom me, and
because I followed them up and punched
them hard when i got near to them a
howl went up from those who are anxious
to see me licked that 1 was a foul tighter
and should not be given a match.
"What do these squealers want me to
do? Stand in the middle of a ring like a
dummy and wait until the other fellow
comes after me? Why, if 1 had done that
there would have been no fighting at all,
and then the sports would cry fake!
faker!
"It's a wonder that those fellows who
have always crucified me for what they
call foul lighting don't cry foul now be
cause Commodore Dewey of the American
squadron did not wait for the Spanish to
make the attack, but instead he went
right after the game himself and ham
mered the Spaniards out of the ring, i
suppose those kid-gloved sports who take
fits at the sight 01 a drop of blood will
say Commodore Dewey should not be al
lowed to command a fleet because he
fights from the drop of the hat and stands
no nonsense.
"Well, I am going to fight Just like
Dewey. I will not wait for the enemy, but
I will go right at him, hammer and tongs,
and then you will see the fur fly. Jeffries
Is a big, powerful gunboat but I will
throw a broadside into him just as the
gong sounds that will cause something
to drop. You wait and see."
The Oakland sports are very sweet on
Jeffries, and It is said that several large
commissions will be sent across the bay
to-morrow to be placed on Jeffries at any
odds.
A sporting man who Is well known In
Vallejo wrote a letter to a friend in this
city, the purport of which was that the
Vallejo boys will visit San Francisco on
Friday and that they will carry with
them several sacks of coin which will bo
placed on the sailur at any odds. It
would seem, therefore, that on the day of
the fight the betting will doubtless be
pretty even.
The fighters are now in fine shape, and
the spectators will surely get a run for
their money.
The San Francisco Athletic Club will
give a first-class entertainment this even
ing at its rooms, :m Sixth street. A
trophy valued at $35 will be given the
winner of the feather-weight champion
ship, and a trophy of less vaJue will be
given to second-best man. The club will
give a special entertainment Wednesday
evening. May 18. and it.Â« ladies' night will
occur on the evening of May 25.

The "Incalculable mineral wealth" of newly

in too many instances really a fable. The

: ". . r ."â  full Measure.
, â¢â  Edward Swift, son of P. Swift, who has
the lumber contract for the School De
â¢ " partment, was put through the sweating
I process last night. It wasn't a Hammam
bath;- but it was just as effective. He
.. .was"- closeted with the Grand Jury for a
...couple of hours, trying not to tell what
.He knew about short measure fire wood,
â¢'..'= which he charged as No. 1 lumber. Swift
. transacts most of his father's business,
-' and .consequently was supposed to know
..- â¢considerable about the frauds in the
.â  /School Department.
â¢ . â¢'- But while kept under fire for two hours,
Swift managed to keep most of hie
knowledge to himself, and in order to do
. so he had to scramble pretty lively.
Awaiting their turn to be grilled, sev
eral' figures familiar to the public were
â /.. gathered in the waiting room. First there
was Inspector O'Brienâ old John
â  '.everybody has read about, but who is
â¢ â¢ remembered particularly because of his
â¢ being Director Ragan's brother-in-law.
â¢. â¢ Then there were Directors Burns and
. Drucker, Secretary Welch, Contractor P.
â¢ 'â â  Swift, and Storekeeper Ryan, all present
â¢ : response to the usual invitation of the
Jury.
â -..-.;. Swift was the first witness called and it
â¢was .five minutes to 10 o'clock when he
was released from the inquisition cham
:;bÂ£rv"his features bearing no trace of en
â  -jp/yment. If he had passed a pleasant
' time he was careful to conceal it.
:. 'â â . \ Some of Mr. Swift's statements were
"..Ingenious, others absurd, and all were
â ;,., framed with palpable intention- of cori
cealing the facts from his inquisitors. He
.â¢was examined at length as to the qual
â ' ity of. the lumber and shingles furnished
: " the -School Department, and was conn
â  -dent-all the material was the best qual
â  â¢ ft.y-.
.. ' . it 'was observed that Mr. Swift made no
. . -reference to memoranda of any descrip
. ..tion;- but depended entirely on his mem
;â¢ â¢ â¢or.y.'.so one of the jurors asked him if
-did not keep a set of books. His reply
. ; ':Was -Ingenious, if not wholly satisfactory
' to .the member of the Grand Jury. Swift
â  /.said he' did keep a set of books, but they
. 'had- become used up, and last February
.(just, about the time the Grand Jury was
'.. -beginning to make matters interesting lor
â  the' department) he got a new set and
â  ' Stored the old books in a paint shop.
.-Some time after, he went to get the'
7 .books, but they had disappeared and he
' haij :.not been able to find any trace of
â¢them."
[ â¢':â¢ Finding it was hopeless to endeavor to
. get .'a sight of the books, the jurymen
â¢ :. : began' "to tax Mr. Swift's brain for an
" s.Vy.is- i<> their exceedingly pointed ques
tions. Sometimes this wad of gray mat
â¢ â¢ t.-r. -showed signs of incipient paresis, as,
â for instance, when Swift was asked why
..he. charged $1 90 a thousand for shingles
â¢vt-h-af could, be bought in open market at
.-".â¢any- time for $170, when his contract
â called for fancy shingles at that price.
.-;â¢ ' : Swift 's reply was that the department
' /demanded a special quality of shingles,
, six" inches or more in width, and in order
"to tain them he had to open the
'".bunches as he bought them and select
those that would pass inspection. Mr.
â  Swift must have sorted his shingles in the
.dark, for the members of the Grand Jury
and--thelr experts who inspected the
school buildings last week that have been
' . repaired recently, found many and many
shingles three and four inches wide.
. ' Swift waa positive that all his lumber
was of the best quality and that he de
slivered every foot he charged for. As his
â ."books have vanished the Grand Jury can
..take his word for that or not as they see
.fit; the planks in the school yards speak
â  for the-mselves as to quality.
â ' After Mr. Swift had been allowed to
escape. Storekeeper Ryan was sum
moned. He told bow he checked up all
â¢ tha supplies for the department and was
' sure everything was straight In the lum
ber furnished. The jury adjourned fur
ther bearing of the school scandal to next
Monday night while Ryan was still on
: â¢the carpet. _____________
SUSPICIOUS DEATH.

HISTORIC UNION HALL DESTROYED.
HISTORICAL Union Hall is in ruins.
Fire broke out in the big building
on Howard street, between Third
and Fourth, about 11 o'clock last
night and despite the efforts of the entire
department the flumes licked up every
particle of inflammable mate-rial before
they could be subdued. Part of the walls
fell In, but with the exception of the
cornice the front remains standing,
though in a tottering condition.
That no lives were lost is almost a
miracle, but as it was several iiremen had
narrower escapes than they care to ex
perience again, and two or three sus
tai;it-d slight injuries.
Adjoining the hall on the east is a one
story building occupied in part by Tres
paille & Hiett as a saloon, the other part
being used as a horse and carriage re
pository- The contents were badly dam
aged by water, and a portion of the roof
was crushed by part of the wall of Union
Hall crushing down upon It. Beside this
building is the St. David's lodging hous-;,
the rear of which was badly scorched,
fcut not severely damaged.
Union Hall was one of the historic build
ings of San Francisco. Old-timers last
light did not agree as to the date of its
jonstructlon, but it was reared during the
var times in 1863 or IS<l4. In that day and
reneration it became a famous hall, where
he select and exclusive of San Francisco
rave the swellest of swell dancing func
ions. Among the noted balls given there
was one under the patronage of San
Francisco society ladles to raise funds for
he Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia
in l^l>). The ball w.-ls held when bonds
to aid the then forthcoming exposition
were disposable as a guarantee fund.
Each ticket to the ball was Jlti, which
entitled the holder to a $10 centennial
bond. The fund, however, was never
used by the promoters of the exposition,
;ts the Government came to the rescue.
The money derived from the issue of
the bonds was placed in a San Francisco
sank, and each holder of a bond received
tils $10 on presenting his bond to the
imnk. Many ether celebrated balls were
jiven in Union Hall.
In 1875 the Democratic State Convention,
which nominated William Irwin for Gov
ernor, was held in Union Hall.

PLEASING PLAY
AT THE COLUMBIA
Miss Knott Scores a Hit With
Mantell in "The Secret
Warrant."
"Texas Steer" at the California â The
Tlvoli's "Wang" Revived â The
Other Theaters.
After months and months of nothing but
farce and vaudeville it is a pleasant task
to chronicle the performance of a legiti
mate play, cleanly written and sym
pathetically acted by a well-balanced
little company. The play is "The Secret
Warrant," written by W. A. Tremayne,
a Montreal journalist, and presented at
the Columbia last night by Robert Man
tell. It is a romance, a modest little ro
mance of no striking originality of situa
tion and climax, but bright and graceful
in its dialogue and of delicate atmos
pheric charm. The scenes are in France
in the time when Philippe, Due D'Orleans,
was regent and blank lettres de cachet
were given to the royal mistress that .she
might supply the victim's name at her
pleasure and send him to the Bastille.
The story of the play has been told in
an earlier issue. The fury of the woman
scorned, the simple, unaffected love of
a simple girl of the middle classes and
the daredevil grit, easy conscience and
(finally) triumphant virtue of the soldier
of fortune hero, are made very picturesque
and very entertaining by both author and
company.
Mr. Mantell, an actor of elaborate ad
dress and somewhat old-fashioned stage
manners, is well litted in the part of the
hero; Miss Marie Booth Russell is largely
h;ti"!some and very effective as the royal
mistress; Miss Marion P. Clifton does an
admirable bit of stout comic character
as the heroine's aunt, and Miss Roselle
Knott is wholly unaffected, magnetic and
delightful as the heroine. The company
is quite good all the way through, the
only notable unevenness being in favor
of Miss Knott, who seems to possess
many <~>f the elements that go to make a
remarkable actress.
A Good Texas Steer.
It Is a good "Texas Steer" that Maurice
Freeman gives at the California, ' and in
his hjittds, and in those of the capable
company which supports him, the charac
teristically American political caricature
farce-comedy becomes invested with all
the charm of a new production. The role
of the politician who brands all the ; fat
mavericks in J the \ shape of emoluments
coming â â  within the radius of his grasp
offers much - temptation to overact, but
Mr. Freeman steered clear of this rock

THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 3, 1893.
Before the Engines Gained Control.
and sand-lotters in this hall during the
period of the Kearney agitation. Later
on the hall was rented for wrestling tour
naments, a skating rink and finally for a
variety theater.
The ba-sement of the building was orig
inally used as a car station of the Omni
bus Railroad Company.
Of late years the place has become run
down, and since Morosco moved to the
Grand Opera House it has been little
used. Of late, however, Lybeck has used
the upper portion for a skating rink and
dances, while the lower portion was used
to store bob-tall cars, a number of which
were destroyed in the lire.
It was a picturesque scene during the
passing of the old place, and many hair
breadth escapes occurred. Soon many
streams were playing on all portions of
the building. The men from engine 17
were lighting the blaze from the roof of
a shed next door, in which is the office of
the Occidental Horse Exchange. When
i\->- lire was at its height the roof col
lapsed, with all on top, and but for an act
Of Providence many would have been
killed. Foreman Dougherty managed to
craw] to the edge and then down a ladder
to safety, after his men had gone before
him. The only injury reported was a
slight stniin of the right foot receive: 1 by
Hoseman Callan, although it was ru
mored that Arthur Samuels had jumped
from the roof at the time he neard the
timbers cracking, receiving a fracture of
the thigh.
The cause of the fire has not been deter
mined, but it is supposed the blaze start
ed in Lybeck's skating rink. The property
is owned by the Market-street Railway-
Company.
Treppuille <Sr Heitt, who keep the How
ard saloon next door, were slight losers
through water, as were those adjoining.
The St. David's House also received a
drenching, but the heaviest losers outsido
of the owners of the building where the
lire originated are 'A. F. Rooker and A
F. Lang of the Occidental Horse Ex
change.
A noticeable feature of the fire was the
fact that the old flagstaff, which lias
stood for many years, was first ignited
on top, and the fire gradually crept down
where it took a firm hold at the base
and finally it fell with a crash in t"h^
raging furnace. Portions of the cornice
dropped from time to time, and all who
fought the blaze realized that the danger
was considerable.
Electric wires burned out in many
places, and a stream of fire ran along
one wire from the burning building to the
house across the alleyway leading to the
stables in the rear. All the horses and
bufgies were saved after hard work, but
the old horse cars were completely de
stroyed.
and gave a consistent characterization of
the role.
The honors of the performance belong
to Ratio Putnam, the "Bossy Grander"
Of the farce, Charles H. Stevens as
â¢Brassy Gall", and Will Bray, the- "Min
ister to Dahomey."
The three Texans who coÂ«t><- * o Wash
ington to investigate the political conduct
of their representative kept the house in
a ripple of merriment, which increased to
shouts of laughter in the dinner scene.
The audience was appreciative and good
humored last night, which speaks well
for the play and the company, consider
ing that the -attendance was not com
mensurate with the merits of ' the per
formance. â â¢:â¢. -i-Viy-
The company is evenly balanced, and
the absence of boisterous horse-play is
as refreshing as a breeze from Manila
ihe performance will be continued dur
ing the remainder of the week.
Lettie le Vjne at Morosco's.
Miss Lettie le Vyne, the singing sou
brette, captured her audience last night
at Morosco's in "Hearts of New York."
.Lettie has a plump little figure, and the
role, by obliging her to wear a short
skirt during the first part of the play,
enables her to charm the eye with the
spectacle of a pair or plump and well
shaped legs that are all her own beyond
any doubt. She is well supported by
Harry Malnhall and Charles Stevens as
Tom Milburu" and "Leonard Knight
leigh, respectively. Lorena Atwood
played the role of "Jane ' Milburn" ac
ceptably, although it is not a part af
fording -opportunities for showy work.
The play is well staged and abounds in
thrilling and picturesque situations. Miss
le Vyne sings sweetly, without affecta
tion, and has the good sense not to at
ternnt to force her voice. She has made
herself a favorite and possesses the Qual
ities that will keep her such.

but a comparatively short time whevi the
flames broke out, and it is supposed the
tire hud been smoldering for some time
before the alarm was turned in.
The firemen had not been working on
Tehama street in the rear of the building
more than fifteen minutes when the up
per portion of the wall, consisting of tons
of brick, mortar and the woodwork of
the cornice, fell to the ground. The wall
was unsafe for Borne minutes before it
fell, so the firemen had been careful
about venturing immediately in the rc;<r,
the streams being thrown from the sides.
But just before the accident J. H. Ho
gan, foreman of engine 6, started
through the alley to the west side of the
building, and this nearly cost him his life.
He had reached about the middle of the
building when the men who were watch
ing his movements saw the wall tremble
and warned him of his danger. He re
treated toward Third street and barely
got out of the way of the wall, being
thrown to the groin, d by the rush of the
wind caused by the falling debris."
Fully half an hour before the alarm was
turned in the people of the Occidental
Horse Exchange, directly behind the
burning building, saw the names and be
gan to rescue the seventy odd- -horses
which they took out through Clementina
street. Gus Palace and Jt. O. West were
in the rear of the building soon after the
lire was Been and broke open a door and
went through the lower floor. They say
that there was no fire there at all, and
the only flames they saw were in the
back part of the second story.
The New St. David's House, 715 Howard
street, had a very narrow escape and
Assistant Chief Engineer Wills deserves
credit for the work done by him and his
men in preventing the flames spreading
to the lodging house. A stream with
three lines of hose from engines 10 9 and
b was kept turned on the west wall of
the building until all danger of its taking
fire was passed. There were nearly 2W
lodgers in the house when roomers on the
west side of the building gave the alarm
that the place was on fire. Christopher
Zimmer. the manager of the lodginvr
house, immediately went through the
halls notifying the people that there was
a lire, and little time was lost by t c
lodgers in making the'.r exit. The NVw

Suecesslul Opening of the Annual
Women's Congress â Interest
ing Papers.
There are twice as l.any men as
there are women on the programme of
the Woman's Congress, but for every
man in the audience there are twenty
five women.
It's an audience of thinkers instead
of dreamers. The enthusiasts of the
first Woman's Congress five years ago,
by their strong individuality and the
frank expression of their hopes and
fears, made those off the stage more
interesting as a study of women-na
ture than those upon it. These have
given place to women of a different
type.
The congress opened yesterday aft
ernoon, Mrs. John F. Swift, the presi
dent, tailing it to order at 2:30. After
a prayer by Rev. Mr. Moreland Rev. Dr.
Cook of Trinity Church delivered the
opening address fur the president. He
was followed oy Rabbi Nieto, who
closed a short talk with a very pretty
compliment to the congress, declaring
that the causes which have been most
worthy, the accomplishments which
have been most successful, have been
those for which women have made
themselves responsible.
The audience applauded vigorously
when it was announced that David
Starr Jordan had agreed to take Dr.
Ross' place on the programme. But
they applauded quite as vigorously
when this announcement was followed
by another to the effect that Dr. Ross,
having recovered from his indisposition,
would address the congress on "Social
Values in Democracy."
"Social Life," said Dr. Ross, "ranks
third or fourth in Importance to men; it
runks second or third to women. To be
fit for society you must bring' to it some
qualification or rather a compound of
qualifications of birth, breeding, brains,
wealth and accomplishments. Other
wise you are a parasite, and people ex

enjoyment and to enjoy. We do not
Choose our friends because of their fine

that in a democracy there must be per

Utopia. In an aristocracy, particular
ly in a country which has suffered con

-. .Although the gathering at the evening
session was not as large as in the after
noon, those who attended were Just as
appreciative. .The playing of the "Star
spangled Banner" was a fitting opening
for the patriotic utterances of President
Jordan of Stanford. Before that able
and well-known speaker was Introduced,
Mrs. - Beck-Meyer of Oakland grave a

Society." She gave an entertaining his
tory of the life of the Danish â  teacher
and farmer and closed- her remarks with
a poem. Although she took the place of
Miss Mollie E. Connors, who was pro
grammed to speak on "Money. Measures
and Men." the speaker mowed a thor
ough knowledge of her; subject.
President Jordan, after lightly touching
on the subject of "Anglomania, Its Cause,
Its Justification and Its Cure," then gave
a brilliant dissertation < on the present
conflict between - this country, and j Spain,
using as a text the well-known and oft
mioted poem of Rudyard Kipling, "Lest
"We Forget." v - v
Speaking to the former subject, he
ridiculed the ' anglomaniacs who believed
it proper to turn up their trousers when
it rained in London, dock their horses'

The Dr. Slocum System at Last
Presents to Mankind a Perfect
and Positive Cure for This Foe
of Health.
CONQUERING THE CURSE OF
CENTURIES.
By Special Arrangement Three Free Bot-
tles of the Dr. Slocum System to All
Readers of " The San Francisco Call."
Science and
consumption have been battling for ages,
and now the glad tidings are being car-
ried around the world by the army of
the saved, that at last science is tri-
umphant, at last consumption has been
overcome and vanquished.
For many
weary years men of science have delved
in a desert of despair, seeking some
means with which to lay low the despoil-
er of human lives, tho wrecker of peace-
ful homes, the grim guardian of the
graveyard â consumption. Now the time
is at hand when all should know that
the terror of consumption is a thing of
the past; that the fatality of the disease
is absolutely unnecessary; that the
means to exterminate it from this glori-
ous world of ours is within the reach
of all, and is an, assured fact.
This annihilation of
consumption, this conqueror of bron-
chitis, asthma, catarrh and all other
complaints of lungs and throat, is named
after its celebrated discoverer, the Doc-
tor Slocum System of Treatment, and
cures by the simplest, the most natural
and yet the most forceful manner, by at
once removing the cause.
You cannot
expect, when a building: is on fire, to
put out all the flames by pouring water
on a portion of them: neither can you
ever expect to conquer consumption by
stupefying the cough and allowing the
deadly germs to continue in their wicked
work.
The Doctor Slocum
System is not in any sense a half-way
worker. It at once attacks the germs |
and drives them, not only out of the
lungs, but out of the entire system. At
t!i" same time, it gradually masters the
cough, until at length it disappears.
Meanwhile
it has been adding vigor and tone and
strength to the blood, until, to the merry
music of returning health, it leaps and
bounds Joyfully through the veins, send-
ing the bright, rich, rosy flush of youth
to the cheeks, till the nerves tingle with
strength, the step becomes elastic, and
the head is held proudly erect, with the
full sense of rejuvenation and recreation.
Why you
fairly thirst for air after you have been
under the Doctor Slocum System for a
little while. Where before you were un-
able to take even the slightest strain on
your lungs in breathing, you find, after
a little bit, that your lungs, once so
poor and tired, greedily take in copious
draughts of air, and away down in the
lower parts, which had been worse than
useless for so long, this pure, heaven-
sent air penetrates and sends the blood
bounding away with the glad tidings of
perfect health, til! you feel, no matter
how great the obstacle, you are ready
and able to cope with it.

its name implies, a comprehensive and
complete system of treatment, which at-
tacks every vulnerable point of tho dis-
ease and completely vanquishes it. It
leaves no point unguarded; it leaves no
pnase of the trouble neglected; it cures,
and cures forever, by absolutely obliter-
ating the cause, and with the cause re-
moved, the disease must necessarily dis-
appear.
lii all the
annals of scientific discoveries the Doc-
tor Slocum System must be accorded first
place, for it overcomes an obstacle which
has been the menace of creation for
countless centuries. It removes from life
one of its greatest dangers and one of its
gravest disasters. It makes life better

DISCOUNTING PEACE.
The "Wall-street circular of Caxley, Stokes &
Co. says of the New York market:
For several weeks past we have been dis
counting war; from this day forward we will
discount peace. By this we mean that the
general tendency of prices will be upward. Of
course in the event of some special disaster
for a moment the market would decline, but
such disaster can only come in any important
degree from a large naval battle.
When we say the market will now. proceed
to discount a settlement of our troubles with
Spain, we do not mean that it will have its
entire advance in the immediate future, but
we do mean that the war scare has gone out
of the security markets. No reaction here
after will take place, except one of a tempo
rary character when the small traders happen
to be overloaded and some false rumor or tem
porary disaster Is made known.
THE LUMBER TRADE.
Pacific Coast Wood and Iron says:
"Despite the war news, the drought and the
dv!! times, the millmen continue to cut lumber
and send it into San Francisco and the south.
Prices are down and will continue so for the
present. The fact is, there is too much lum
ber made. One order for BOO.OQO feet, special
sizes, to be used in flumes, was placed with a
Humboldt mill and cutting on it will be com
menced at once. Steamers are being withdrawn
from the Alaskan routes and will soon be back
Jn the lumber carrying trade, so a large influx
of shingles may soon be expected, as there are
many millions awaiting shipment. On the
whole, there is a better feeling among: the
miilmen and hopes are entertained of a better
state of affairs.
"The Spanish-American war is havine its
influence upon Eastern trade circles and the
lumber industry is somewhat affected. There
are divers opinions prevalent regarding the
ultimate effect of the conflict, but the general
feeling is confident. In fact, fear of a crisis 13
fceM by but few, and even the more conserva
tive hold that the prices will advance after a
little slump, which may occur early in the
season. A tendency to wait is seen throughout
the East and Middle West, but this is only
temporary.
"Unlike on this Coast, the crop prospects on
the othor bI ntJnent are very prom
ising and prices are Bteady and remunerative.
The Atlantic Bhippins fates :u-p naturally high,
owing to the war risks, and vessrls sail with
cargoes Quoted at risk of purchasers. Rnil
will tnke precedence over sea shipments, an*l
an advance of prices will necessarily follow
this important alteration.
"A resume of the entirÂ° lumber industry in
the United States finds but little change, unless
for the hotter, and the war scare will soon be
over. Every victory of our forces tends to
force conditions to a normal basis with every
prtispect of continuation throughout the year."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NTTW YORK. May 2.â Wall street saw a day
of speculative acti\Â»ity and furor whlrh lias
not be*n equaled before this year. There were
many varying phases in the events of the flay.
The upward surgre of prices at the opening
wan met by enormous offerings to realize which
oauMd a loss oÂ£ from a third to * hair from
the opening grain. The upward movement was
then renewed and there were occasional periods
of hesitancy afterward, but no serious re
action. The market closed in another burst
of animation and very buoyant in tone, with
prices, except for a few stocks, at the top
level. When the market opened the influential
bull operators who bought stocks last week in
anticipation of a United States victory in the
Philippines stood ready to take their profits.
Evidently the operations of this coterie had
been largest In Sugar, St. Paul and Burling
ton. They were aware that the news of com
modore Dewey's victory had brought large or
ders to the commission houses to buy stocks,
and they met the outside demand by bidding
up the prices at the opening as far as lay in
their power. They succeeded in effectine a
jump of 6% In Sugar and about four points in
Burlington and St. Paul. Their heavy selling
to realize in these stocks caused a reaction all
through the market. The accounts of the bat
tle in Manila left it a question whether the
United States vessels could effect the es
tablishment of a base for further operations
or whether they would be obliged to make for
home The London Exchange was closed for
a holiday and Paris was looked to for a re
flection of the foreign view of the engagement.
There was firmness in Spanish 4s at that cen
ter, the price having pained 5-lfi net by the
time trading ceased. These elements of doubt
helped the reaction in the first hour. But as
additional scraps of information began to
come to hand, especially that through British
official sources, there grew up a better appre
ciation of the scope of the advantage gained
and of its probable effect in bringing about an
early termination of the war.
The volume of outside orders from all over
the country showed a large increase as the
day progressed, and the demand was so active
and confident that the effect of the early re
action was entirely overcome. The grangers
and the internationals showed remarkable
strength as groups, and the majority of these
stacks showed net gains of over three points
on the day. Even more striking gains were
shown in some special cases. Consolidated Gas
rose 8 points, Pullman 9% points ex-dividend.
Lackawanna 11 points over Saturday's bid
price, and Oregon Navigation preferred gained
4-V Net grains otherwise are mostly found
within a radius of 1 to 3 points. The scramble
to buy at the opening was terrific and simul
taneous prices varied from 2 to 3 points in
Sugar, Burlington, St. Paul and Manhattan.
Standard Oil liquidating certificates were the
feature of the outside market with an advance
of IB points.
The bond market leaped into activity and
showed notable strength, the speculative issues
leading with gains of about 2 per cent. Single
Mocks of $150,000 of the Northern Pacific and
Atchison 4s changed hands. Total salps,
$3,775,000.
United States new 4s coupon ex-dividend ad- ]
vanced to 119%, new 4s registered 1, the old

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. May 2.â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: The only
event to note in the money market was the
growing belief that the war may collapse soon
and the revival of the New York demand for
gold. New York bought Â£300.000 of this week's
arrival from the Cape, and the price has risen
to 77s o%id. The Immediate future of the money
market hinges on the New York demands for
gold and the effect of the Chinese indemnity
payment on Saturday next.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, May 2.â On the belief that the
war would soon be ended prices to-day de
clined on the Board of Trade. Despite higher
quotations in Europe traders here sold every
thing freely. Trading in wheat began with
the American naval victory at Manila upper
most in the speculative mind. Traders be
lieved that the end of the war was possibly
in sight, and that it would be followed
by a cessation of the urgent foreign â  demand.
From the start professionals Bold July wheat
freely lc below Saturday's close. They dm
that in spite of the fact that Liverpool started
1 Id higher, and did not convince themselves of
I having perhaps too hastily commenced dis
i counting the termination of the war until.later
i quotations from Liverpool showed steady ma
! terial additions to the initial advance. The
| Chicago bears amended their original views on
seeing the continued foreign strength, and the
I result was a recovery in the course of an hour
!of all the early decline. Rumors of the sur
i render of Manila caused several sharp breaks
later. The visible supply decreased 2,651,000
bushels. Fine weather reports were offset by
predictions of frost in the West. July started
lc lower at from 93%@94c, improved gradually
to 94% c, dropped back to 94%c,and advanced
again to 95% c. It dipped as low as 93% c. The
close was at 94%@94%c. a net loss of %c. May
opened Vie lower at $1 20, declined to $1 17%,
reacting to $1 20 at the close.
Fine weather was the dominant influence in
the corn pit. Liquidation was heavy in all
! options. July closed %c net lower.
Trading in oats was heavy- Distant futures
ruled weak throughout on free liquidation.
May closed %c lower and July lc lower.
The Manila victory caused some selling of
â  provisions and prices ruled lower throughout.
I Liverpool quoted bacon firm and lard 3d
higher. July pork lost 22% c, lard 12% c and ribs
10c.

MAY HAVE HID
HIS LAST WILL
Life History of Peter
Christensen, Who
Died Rich.
His Estate to Be Settled Up
With a Minimum of
Litigation.
Only One Woman Was Ever Known
to Have Been Seen on
His Ranch.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, May 2.
Rarely has a large estate, over which
hung all the elements of a bitter and ex
pensive contest, been settled more quietly
or more prosaically than that of Peter i
Chriptensun, xi hermit of San Joaquin
County, who died several months ago.
Christensen's life, while not particular- ,
ly romantic, has been one of interest from
the time be was left a little orphan boy
on the island of Islon, in Germany, to the I
tin.c he died, leaving property valued at j
(150,000 In this and San Joaquin counties.
The old man. so far as can be ascertained,
I not leave a will, although it is said
' c was drawn up some years ago. But
he left four heirs in Germany and a
friend near rlaywards, if true, shows that :
the deceased evidently intended to leave
him a goodly legacy. â¢ .
William K rough, who has just learned i
the addressee and names of the German
heirs, lives on a ranch in Castro Valley,
about five miles from Haywarda. He is
perhaps the only living man that knows
the history of Christenaen, and if he were
not so unselfish and philosophical the
way would not be difficult for him to cre
ate much trouble fur the deceased's rela

CHILDREN'S DAY AT THE CHUTES.
Acres of HaDDU Boys and Little Girls, Like a Field Full of Sweet Roses, Rome
and Plau, View the Menagerie and Shoot the Chutes Till Night,
- : -Yesterday was May day at the Chutes. Managerial foresight had provided many thousands of children with tickets,
â free of charge. The result of this liberality was visible early in the day. A procession that would reach from the Pre
sidio to the Potrero was alive and moving chuteward before noon, and by 2 p. m. Young America owned everything in
sight-
Imagine an overflow from all the schools, which were closed in honor of May day. said overflow pouring in a restless
stream through the turnstiles for hoursâ and that is one view of the situation. Once within the inclosure, the scene was
one- vast picture of romping childhoodâ yelling, singing, riding elephants, loading down the merry-go-round, playing with
the monkeys, studying Chiquita's antics, shooting the chutes, riding over the scenic railroad and yelling out of the bub
' b\lng exhilaration of childhood's happy hours.
The eye beheld boys by the acre and girls like a field full of sweet roses. They had forgotten their lessons, cast
aside their books and turned themselves out for a day of uninterrupted sightseeing ajid play. Thousands viewed the ani
mals in the menagerie and thousands shot the chutes. The auditorium show was repeated for the benefit of those who
could not get in the first time, and the day wore away amid revelry, Joy being uninterrupted to the last.
Next to the monkey gymnasium, where Phil Hastings' trained goat played with the monkeys and coons, dogs and
badgers for the benefit of the multitude, the old elephant. Jolly, was the center of attraction. He made scores of trips

â  and the great beast was tied to his stake for the day.
The Board of Education allowed tickets to the free show to be distributed in the schools last week, and the day
was therefore long looked forward to by the children as a time for unbridled amusement. So by the time the shadows
had grown long on the hilltops the children were satiated and ready to go to their homes with the memory of such a
throrg of their own kind as they had never seen before and as they may never see or enjoy In the same way again.

verifying the details of Christensen's
death I wrote a letter to the Mayor of
my home in Germany and secured from
him a certificate showing that the rela
tionship between my father and Chris

stated. The certificate is also signed by
an official there who was the Judge when
we left Germany. Father had some of
Christensen's savings at that time and
turned them over to this Judge, whose
testimony now is particularly valuable to
"As soon as the property is properly
administered upon and ordered to be dis
tributed I will be appointed the heirs rep
resentative and take charge of it for their
interest. This much has already been de
cided upon. There is money enough in
the bank. I believe, to pay all expenses
give each of the heirs a good present and
to keep the real property in good shape.
The cousins in Germany need the money
worse than I do. but I shall be paid for
all that I do for thorn. The rest of the
estate consists of land, horses, bonds in
the Dnion Navigation Company and per
sonal property."
Notice of the existence of the heirs has
been filed in the Superior Court of San
Joaquin County. The cousins are: Hans
C. Thorelsen, Mrs. Catherine M. Jacob
sen, Mrs. Christine M. Wolf and Mrs.
Helen A. Haverner. It la said to be easy
of proof that there are no more heirs and
the estate left by the thrifty but generous
old bachelor will soon be distriouted.

A NARROW ESCAPE.
Borax Works Employe Falls Into a
Vat of Boiling Chemicals.
AIiAMEDA, May 2.â Frank Smith, of
1515 Mozart street, an employe of the
borax works, had a narrow escape from
â  r death ono day last week, the par
ticulars of which have just been made
public. He was employed about the tanks
in which the borax is boiled, and in pass
ing from one to another stepped on a
plank, which turned and plunged
him into one of the great vats in which
was about two feet of hot liQuid. He
struck on his side, but fortunately re
tained his presence of mind and pulled
himself out instantly. His legs from the
knees down were terribly burned, and his
hands, arms and sides were also scalded.
His clothes protected him to some extent,
but if he had not extricated himself as
soon as he did he must have perished. He
is resting comfortably and will recover.

YET WEALTHY.
Mystery of the Woman
Rancher of Contra
Costa.
Search Being Made for Friends
of Eccentric Mrs. William
Kreigher.
Dresses in Hags and Sacks, Yet Has
a Bank Account In San
Francisco.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, May 2.
Mrs. William Kreigher, the mysterious
woman of Pinole, is now sick unto death
at her ranch house, about six miles from
the depot. She was discovered a few
days ago by some callersâ for she had
few acquaintances and less friends â in a
sick and squalid condition, although she
is generally supposed to be wealthy.
Mrs. Kreigher has lived many years on
her ranch, and many stories have been
told of her supposed wealth. A few
months ago a photographer who was in
that neighborhood obtained the first pic
ture of this peculiar woman that was ever
taken, and although he worked with an
ordinary camera she was not aware of
his purpose.
Arthur Logan of this city was taking a
trip through Contra Costa County when
he discovered this eccentric woman. She
was clad in the wrecks of many gar
ments, appeared to be about 60 years of
age, and suffered no one to enter her
house.
For many years she was never known
to leave the premises except to make an
annual visit to San Francisco. On these
occasions the woman would wear an ele
gant silk dress and shoes. At all other
times she wore rags, sacks and almost
went with bare feet. On her annual trip
it was stated that she went to her bank
ers in San Francisco and deposited the
result of her year's hard work and thrift.
All kinds of estimates of her wealth have
been made, but no one knows authorita
tively whether she Is worth $1000 or $20,000.
Certain it is that she never let any one
into the secret.
The woman has not been seen on her
ranch for some time, and this caused
some inquiry' to be made. People wont to
the house, which they found in a horrible
condition, and the woman said she had
been sick for over a month and had been
but poorly fed and nourished. She is now
being cared for, and interested parties are
trying to discover whether she ha.s any
relatives in this part of the world who
might be persuaded to look after her in
her old age. _____

STRUCK BY A LOCAL TRAIN.
Knocked From the Seventh-street
Trestle and Died in an Hour.
OAKLAND, May 2.â The 2 o'clock local
train across the Estuary on the Seventh
street bridge is supposed to have struck
and knocked an unknown man into the
water and mud beneath. He was dragged
out by means of a rope and removed to
the Receiving Hospital. His head and
ribs on the right side were badly frac
tured and he died before 3 o'clock.
On his person was found a free peddlar's
license granted to D. J. Nelson, January
4. He had a G. A. li- receipt in the name
of George Oakley, dated Los Angelos,
September 12, IM>3, from Frank Bartlett
Post No. C>. There was also a card bear
ing the name F. C. Nelson, 1003% Broad
way. Inquiries make at the address
failed to find any one who knew such a
person.
The dead man was removed to the
Morgue. He is apparently about 60 years
of age and was minus one eye. He is sup
posed to have been walking across the
bridge, and this would indicate that he
was a stranger here, as there is a foot
and wagon bridge only one block north
of the one he was on. He might have
fallen from a car platform.
Oakland News Items.
OAKLAND, May 2.â .1. W. Moore, watchman

much liquor. He was picked up unconscious
at Broadway and Second street th!s morning.
Chiquita will arrive in her tiny brougham
and pony, a present from ex-President Grover
Cleveland, to-morrow. She will open her re
ception at lOCO Broadway at 2 p. m., and will
undoubtedly attract great throngs.

presented for probate to-day by Flora E. and
George C. Bauer, children of tt.e deceased.
The property is valued at 165,000, with $4000
personal property. These two, aged 25 and 23
respectively, and Louisa X., aged 17, are the
sole heirs. __________________
"TOO FEARFUL
TO CONTEMPLATE"
Attorney McDonald on De
mocracy Without
Music
Martial Strains for Budd Ars Still
Charged Up Against the
Committee.
Oakland Office Sah Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, May 2.
The Democratic campaign in this county
starts out seriously handicapped. Alameda
! is a sensitive county. It is always willing
! to be stirred to its center and to be en-
I thused to its very depths, provided the
right means are used to do the stir
ring and the enthusing. In the past this
political county has always gone wild at
election time, partly over the principles
i that the different political parties have
I set forth, but also in a measure by thÂ«
' liberality of the music which has been
supplied by the respective county com
mittees.
Nearly four years ago many votes were i
made for Governor I'.udd by the beautiful
strains of the Democratic music that par
aded the streets of uakand. Everybody
was charmed with it, but everybody '
knows also that it was not paid for. There
are now on file over lifty suits against all :
the members of the old Democratic |
County Committee, and all are on appeal
in some form or another, of # which the
average mind knows withing. but which
j have for over throe years prevented the
I musicians from getting their money.
"The position is very serious," said At
j torney McDonald to-day, "and it may re- |
j suit In our having to make the Democratic
i campaign without music. Possibly there
are enough loyal Democratic musicians
who would play for the. glory there la In
it, but I will not vouch for this. Of
course, it will seriously handicap us if
there Is no music, but the county com
mitteemen who are sued cannot be ex- |
pected to shoulder the old debts of their i
predecessors. Nobody denies that when â 
the Budd campaign was on we had plenty
of music; no one denies that the bills of I
the. musicians should have been settled
long ago; but it is a fact that this busi- |
ness is Htill pending somewhere in the
court, and it would be too horrible to
contemplate that the musicians of this
county should boycott the Democratic >
campaign."
For over a year these suits have been j
sleeping, and the collector to whom these
claims were assigned has shown no desire
to have them disturbed.

New Baseball Captain.
BERKELEY, May 2.â Donald McLaren
'99 has been elected captain of the Uni
versity of California baseball team for
the season of 1599. The election was
made unanimous by the members of this
year's team according to the regular cus
tom. McLaren played second base on the
college nine during the past season and
is one of the most earnest and conscien
tious player* In college. During the past
season McLaren has not missed a single
night's practice on the diamond except
when laid off on account of injuries or
by direction of Coach Cochran.
The new captain has mad a the college
nine every year since he has been in col
lege. In '96 he played shortstop, in - '.<7
shortstop and left field and this year he
took the place formerly filled by Cap
tain Elston '97. at second base. Before
entering college he played baseball at the
Lowell High School, San Francisco, from
which he graduated in ISPS.
McLaren is the son of Superintendent
John McLaren of Golden Gate Park. For
years even before he entered the High
Sshool he played ball in the park. There
are few amnteur ball players in San
Francisco who do not know him, at least
by reputation. "Scotch." as the Berkeley
players familiarly call him, has praeti
caify captained the infield during the past
season, and his election as captain to suc
ceed "Diddy" Hoag has met with unani
mous satisfaction by the blue and gold
supporters.
BRITT'S SPASM
OF ECONOMY
Opposed to Granting the
Taxation Committee
an Expert.
Mayor Phelan Places His Con
tingept Fund at the Mem
bers' Disposal.
Quick Consumption Meters Caused
the Veto of the Electric Light
Company's March Bill.
About the only ripple to mar the seren
ity of the meeting of the Board of Su
pervisors yesterday was the refusal of
Britt and his followers to grant the Com
mittee on Assessments and Taxation an
expert to prepare figures to fight an in
creased assessment already threatened by
the State Board of Equalization.
It is not at all probable that the action
of the majority was prompted by motives
of economy, but because they would have
no hand in naming the export, that duty
devolving upon the committee, which con
| sists of Clinton, chairman, Dodge and
! Lackmann.
The hostility of the majority was first
made apparent by a resolution from the
Finance Committee to indefinitely post
pone action on the request of the Assess
ment Committee to appoint an expert at
$175 a month.
Clinton opposed the resolution. He said
it was absolutely necessary that an ex
pert be employed for the next three or
four months and devote his entire time
to the work, as the members of the com
mittee could not spare the time. To re
fuse the employment of an expert would
be to practically abolish the committee,
and he would ask to be relieved from fur
ther duty on it.
Rottanzi wanted to know why Newman,
the Finance Committee's expert, could not
do the work. He had comparatively lit
tle to do now, and the Supervisor thought
he might as well be given a chance to
earn his salary.
Dodge said the work could not be done
properly by Newman, as it would require
the undivided attention of the expert for
Several months. He said that last year
the committee had been allowed an ex
pert at a cost of about $600, and he had
taved the people $100,000 by preparing
tics that induced the equalizers not
to increase the assessment of this city
and county. He, too, would decline to
B< r\e Hn the committee if it was not al
lowed iin expert.
Dodges remarks about the people being
saved $100 000 impelled Britt to move that
the Assessment and Taxation Committee
be abolished altogether. Evidently he did
not propose to give the taxpayers another
chance to escape.
Mayor Phelan announced that More
house and other equalizers had already
Intimated to him that San Francisco's
assessment was to be increased mater
ially. This brought Rottanzi to his feet
with the explanation that Dodge's re
marks had convinced him that Newman
would not be available for the commlt-
Britt's motion was lost, Hasklns and
Smith voting with Dodge, Laokmann,
Rottanzi and Clinton.
Lackmann, following the other two,
tendered his resignation as a member of
the committee, but Mayor Phelan would
not accept any of them. Instead* he
authorized the committee to employ an
expert and placed his contingent fund at
its disposal to pay the salary.
The Mayor's veto of the order author
ising the payment of $869 99 to the Edison
Klectric L,ij?ht and Power Company, for
lighting the City Hall for March, was
taken up, and Rottanzi asked that the
veto message be read. It was found that
the message was not at hand, but the
Mayor explained that his reason for veto
ing' the order was that the company's
moters in the City Hall were charging
for much more electricity than was used.
Eleven of the meters had been found to
be very fast, according to the exports
who had tested them, and he thought the
company should be compelled to make
a proper reduction in the bill.
The matter was referred to the Finar.ca
Committee with instructions to have the
bill corrected.
The Mayor's veto of the order accept
ing the sidewalks around Alamo square,
ana that of the order accepting the sew
ering of Scott street, between Hayes and
Fulton, were overruled.
Bids were received as follows: For
printing the delinquent tax list: Post. 43
c-r.ts a name; Report. 40 cents a name;
Journal of Commerce, 7 cents a name.
J. P. Devereau was removed from the
position of attendant upon insane pa
tients and John Kelley appointed in his
place at a salary of $75 a month.
The following communication was re-
C'\\i <i from City and County Attorney

SWINDLED AN
OLD RANCHER
George Russell of Ari
zona the Victim of
Two Friends.
They Rob Him of His Money
and Leave Him Stranded
in Eureka.
A preconcerted plan to rob an old man
of all the money he possessed In the
world was exposed by the police yester
day, when J. B. Johnson was booked at
the City Prison on a charge of grand
larceny.
It appears that George Russell, who
is 81 years of age, sold his ranch in
Arizona for $600. Old as he was, he had
the ambition to go to the Klondike to
join in -*c search for gold. J. B. Johnson
and T. Meadows knew of his intention
and agreed to accompany him to the gold
fields.
They arrived here on April 23 and reg
istered at the International Hotel. Next
morning Russell discovered that the $600
which he had received for his ranch had
disappeared. He had the money secreted
in his clothes, but it had been stolen. He
complained to Johnson, and he told him it
would be all right, and that day Johnson
put him on the boat to Eureka, telling
him that they were going to Seatte.
When they arrived at Eureka Johnson
took the old man to a hotel and, making
some excuse, left him there. Johnson
sailed from Eureka on the steamer Oriz
aba, and as soon as Russell found he had
been victimized he told his story to
Sheriff Brown at Eureka, and he commu
nicated with Chief Lees.
Detectives Gibson, Wren and Dinan
wore detailed on the case, and they went
to the water front on Saturday evening
to meet the steamer Orizaba. They rec
ognized Johnson from a description of him
and followed him after he left the steamer
to the Oakland ferry ticket office, where,
after he had purchased a ticket for Oak
land, they placed him under arrest. He
protested vigorously against being arrest
ed, and said he had only $10 in his pock
ets. The detectives took him to the Harb
or police station, and on being stripped
a wad containing $260 was found sewed
up in his undershirt.
Yesterday a warrant was sworn to in
Judge Joachlmsen's court charging John
son with grand larceny, and he was
booked on the charge at the City Prison.
The detectives have been unable to find
Meadows, who is suspected of haying in
his possession half of the amount taken
from Russell, and they believe he has
gone to Seattle, where Johnson was to
join him. Chief Lees has communicated
with the Chief of Police at Seattle, and the
probability Is that Meadows will be ar
rested there and brought back to the city.

ATTEMPTED
TO BRAIN
HIS WIFE
Mrs. Prendergast Bru
tally Beaten by Her
Husband.
Tried to Throw a Coal-
Oil Lamp at
Her.
Claims He Is Related to the
Assassin of Mayor Harri
son of Chicago.
TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL.
The Unfortunate Woman Bruised
About the Face and the
Body.
Mrs. Rose Prendergast. aged 22 years,
living at 1217 Mission street, was brutally
assaulted by her husband last night. Ac
cording to her story her husband returned
lmme in an Intoxicated condition and
proceeded to abuse her. When she ex
ilated with him lie struck her in the
face, knocking her down. While she lay
prostrate on the floor Prendergast, she
alleges, repeatedly struck her, bruising
her left eye and cutting her lip.
Her screams attracted the attention of
the landlady of the house, who summoned
Police Officer Campbell. Before the lat
ter reached the place Prendergast picked
up a coal oil lamp and vainly endeavored
to brain his unfortunate wife. Realizing
that he intended to seriously injure her,
the brave woman, after a short struggle,
took the lamp from him. She then at
tempted to leave the room when her bru
taÂ» husband seized her and endeavored to
get possession of the lamp.
â¢ Knowing that he intended to do mÂ©
up," remarked the abused woman, "I
threw the lamp at him, hoping to deter
him from further injuring me. It struck
him in the head, cutting a gash from
which considerable blood flowed. At this
juncture the policemen entered the room
anu placed my husband under arrest.
"1 married Prendergast when 1 was
only 14 years of age,' continued the un
fortunate woman, "Four children were
born to us, but happily for them they are
au dead. For some time past my hus
band, who supported us by peddling dry
goods, has been drinking heavily, fre
quently remaining away from home sev
eral nights at a time. He has repeatedly
threatened to kill me and taen commit
BUicide. A short time ago he broke my
jaw and 1 left him. He pleaded so hard
for me to return to him that I forgave
him and went to live with him again."
Mrs. Prendergast says that her hus
band told her that he was related to the
man who assassinated Mayor Harrison of
Chicago.
"During one of his drunken spells,
tearfully remarked the injured woman,
"he informed me that his father had died
in an insane asylum in Chicago and that
the murderer of Mayor Harrison was his
cousin. He also told me that his entire
family had a 'screw loose,' as he ex-
. pressed it, and that he was afflicted in
the same way. I became alarmed over the
assertion, hut it was not until he broke
my iaw that I concluded he was mentally
deYanged. At that time he acted like an
Insane person, and 1 left him, as I feaxed
that he would kill me."
Mrs. Prendergast. in eorroboratlon of
her story of the brutal treatment accorded
her by her husband, exhibited a bruise
over the eye and a lacerated wound on
the lip. After her husband was locked
up in the City Prison on charges of
drunkenness and battery she was taken
to the Receiving Hospital, where her
wounds were dressed by Assistant Police
Surgeon Tormey. Captain Spillane intends
to see that Prendergast receives the se
verest sentence that the law allows. He
will appear against him to-day and per
sonally conduct the prosecution of his
case.
WORKMEN ARE
LOSING TOOLS
Carpenters Suffering Severely
From the Inroads of
Thieves.
Tha Police on the Trail of What
Appears to Be *n Organized
Gang.
The police of this cfty are hot on the
trail of what seems to be an organized
gang of tool thieves.
A daring robbery of this kind occurred
only yesterday, and the indications are
that the thieves went to the trouble of
bringing a horse and wagon with them to
assist in carrying away the booty. A new
building is in course of construction at
the corner of Sutter and Hyde streets,
owned by Attorney Hutton. When the
. workmen left the building the usual ter
n. porary door was apparently fastened by a
padlock, and in addition to this a trust
worthy watchman was left In charge.
When the men came back to work in
the morning they found the building had
been entereo. and whatever tools haa been
left lying loose had been carried away.
In addition to this, a complete set owned
by Walter Goff had been carried away.
Mr. Goff had carefully gathered his tools
and locked them up in his chest, but all
had been taken. Many of the tools in the
chest were new, and as tools form a large
portion (if a carpenter's stock-in-trade tne
loss was felt keenly. Another workman
also lost many new and valuable tools
the same night, and, judging from the
weight and buiK of the articles taken, the
thief or thieves must have employed a
wagon in which to carry away the booty.
The police have been put on the trail, arid
in the future all buildings in process of
construction or repair will be carefully
guarded.
A NIGHT OF SCOTCH SONG.
St. Andrew's Society Entertains Its
Friends â Picnic Next Saturday.
The members of St. Andrew's Society
â  held an open meeting last evening in
â¢their hall to which were invited their many
friends. There was an audience of ladies
and gentlemen who crowded the hall to
its utmost, and it was treated to a choice
programme of Scottish song and recita
tions. James S. Webster, president of the
society, presided. The vocalists were R.
D. Burncss, G. Menzies, R. Duncan,
James Hill, Miss Baumgarten, George St.
John Bremmer, A. C. Ballingall, An
drew McNair and William Balnaves,
while the recitations were by Miss .Elsie
A. Duncan. These were loudly applauded,
and each of those named was forced to
give an encore.
The president announced that the an
nual picnic of the society will be held in
Fairfax Park on Saturday next.
At the close of the meeting the entire
audience, at the request of the president,
arose and sang "The Star Spangled Ban
nerr." and then followed with "Auld
Lang Syne."

MILLIONS OF
ACRES TIED UP
Pre-emption Settlers Must
Vacate Railroad Lands
Down South.
Decision of the Circuit Court
Reversed in Favor of the
S. P. R. R. Company.
Settlers Who Have Received United
States Patents Hold Them Only
in Trust for the Hoad.
The United States Circuit Court of Ap
peals yesterday reversed the decree of
the Circuit Court in favor of the defen
dants in the case of the Southern Pacific
Railroad Company vs. Otto Groeck and
C. S. Merrill Jr. Judge Gilbert read the
opinion.
It recites that the Southern Pacific
Railroad Company brought suit against
the appellees to obtain a decree that the
appellees hold in trust a patent which
Otto Groeck received from the United
States to a certain tract of land, which.
It is contended, was land granted by the
United States to the railroad company by
the act of date July 27, 1860.
The decision is to the effect that the
land in controversy was, at the time of
the entry of Groeck. and at the time
when he took steps to acquire title there
to, withdrawn from settlement by the act
of the Secretary of the Interior.
After such lands have been set aside
by Congressional act, no authority Is
vested in the Secretary of th<- Interior or
in any officer of the J^and Department to
restore them or ope* them to settlement.
Nor is any right conferred upon a pre
emption settler to take advantage of such
default of the grantee.
U follows from the rulings ot the Su
preme Court that the plea of laches can
not avail the appellees. The laches la
said to consist in the long delay of the
ra^road company in constructing the
road and selecting the indemnity bonds.
The Court of Appeals was unable to see
how that delay has conferred rights upon
the pre-emption settler, or how it now af
fords him ground to impute inequity to
the company. The company owed no
duty to any intended settler upon the
public domain. The United States did not
over this land to Groeck, nor did it Invite
his occupancy or entry. He was a tres
passer on t.ie premises. His pre-emption
entry was not only void, but it was un-
The appellant and Groeck were not in |
the attitude of persons to whom the land â ,
in controversy was offered on equal
terms, giving to the first entryman the
prior right. It was offered only to the
railroad company. . _. ..
The case was remanded to the Circuit
Court fnr further proceedings consistent :
with the decision.
The principle involved In this case coy- :
ers about fifteen million acres along the
line of the road in California, Arizona .
and New Mexico.
ROSS' DECISION
IS AFFIRMED
The North Bloomfield Mining
Company Must Not
Operate.
Ii Must Comply With the Act of Con
gress Regulating Hydraulic Min
ing in Every Respect.
The United States Circuit Court of Ap
peals yesterday affirmed the judgment of
Circuit Judge Ross in the case of the
I'nited States of America against the
North Bloomneld Mining Company. The
lower court had issued an injunction per
petually enjoining the mining company
from hydraulic mining until it should have
tiled with the Debris Commission the peti
tion set forth in the act of Congress, ac
companied by the conveyance therein
mentioned and otherwise conformed to the
rules and regulations prescribed by the
commission by virtue of that statute.
Judge Hawley rendered the decision for
the court, and in the course of his re
marks said that the references already
made and the provisions quoted clearly
showed that the act of Congress meant
just what it said. When it declares that
certain things must be done before any
permit is given, it means that they shall
be done. And if these things are not
done, as therein provided, no permit can
be issued, and if none is procured the
working of the mine by the hydraulic
process is prohibited and made unlawful.
The language and terms of the act when
viewed in the light of the history of the
times and all the surrounding conditions,
are clear, certain, positive and mandatory.
Any other view would unquestionably lead
to absurd results, which all courts declare
should be avoided in the construction of
any statute. There would be no positive
protection either to the miners, farmers or
the Government; litigation and strife,
which it was the object of the statute to
avoid, would continue to reign supreme.
Under the law mine-owners engaged in
hydraulic mining have no right to use
the streams without the permission of the
commissioners appointed under the pro
visions of the act. In other words, the
act of Congress, of itself, prohibits all
hydraulic mining unless its terms are first
complied with. The whole case is vir
tually disposed of in the conclusions al
ready reached, that the act is mandatory
and constitutional.
The navigable rivers being the property
of the nation, it follows that any injury
to them which affects the commerce of
the country is an injury to property
rights, and the mere fact that penalties
are imposed upon all parties found guilty
of violating any of the provisions of the
act does not of itself prevent the issu
ance of an injunction to protect the prop
erty rights of the Government in the
rivers. Where%'er commerce among the
States goes, the power of the nation, as
represented by the courts of the United
States, goes with it to protect and en
force its rights.
Under the provisions of the act hydraulic
mining in the territory named is pro
hibited unless the term? and conditions
which it imposes are complied with. If
these provisions are detrimental and in
jurious instead of beneficial to the mining
interests which it was intended to foster,
encourage and protect, the efforts of all
those interested in that particular busi
ness should be directed to have it re
pealed or amended instead of attempting
to evade it or destroy its efficacy. While
it remains the law on this subject it must
be obeyed.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 3, 189 S.
MUST SATISFY
WIDBER'S BOND
Supervisors Take Steps
to Recover From the
Surety Company.
Attorney Creswell Instructed
to Begin Suit if Reis' De
mand Is Ignored.
Insurance Commissioner A. J. Clunie
Threatens to Revoke Its License
if It Ro.uses to Pay.
Acting on the advice of City and
County Attorney Creswell the Board of
Supervisors yesterday took steps to re
cover from the Fidelity and Deposit
Company of Maryland $100,000. the
amount of defaulting Treasurer Wid
ber's bond. In compliance with the re
quest of the board for an opinion At
torney Creswell sent the following com
munication:
SAN FRANCISCO, May 2, 1898.
To the Board of Supervisors: I am in
receipt of resolution No. 1056 (fourth ser
ies) requesting me to report to the board
I what steps should be taken to recover from
the Fidelity and Deposit Company of
Maryland the amount for which it is
liable as surety upon the official bond of
A C Widber, ex-Treasurer of the City
', and County of San Francisco, and to fur
i nish the board with such resolutions as
1 in my judgment should be adopted to ac
â  complish such recovery.
In my opinion an action should be com
menced at once against the Fidelity and
Deposit Company of Maryland and A. C.
: Widber upon the official bond, after prop
: er demand has been made for the pay
ment of the money, and to that end I
I submit herewith: First, draft of resolu- j
tion instructing Christian Rcis, as Treas- j
; urer of the City and County of San I< ran- j
â  clpco, to make a formal demand in writ- i
ing upon paid Fidelity and Deposit Cor. -
pany of Maryland for payment of $100,000
i of the public money misappropriated by
1 A. C. Widber during his term of office as
Treasurer, and directing me to commence
1 an action upon the refusal of the com
pany to pay the same; and. second, writ
ten demand for the $100.0)0 so misappro- |
priated, to be served upon the managing:
agent of the Fidelity and Deposit Com
pany of Maryland, representing the com
pany in this State.
HARRY T. CRESWELL,
Attorney and Counselor.
In accordance with this communica- <,
! tlon the board immediately adopted
this resolution:
Resolved, That Christian Reis, Treas- j
urer of the City and County of San Fran- !
Cisco, be and he hereby is, directed to |
i make formal demand in writing upon the j
| Fidelity and Deposit Company of Mary- I
I land, a corporation, for the sum of $100.-
I 000, being the amount for which the said
i corporation is liable as surety on the offi
cial bond of Augustus C. Widber, as
Treasurer, for public moneys misappro
priated by him during his term of office,
and
Resolved, That the City and County At- j
torney be and he hereby is empowered :
i and directed, upon the refusal of the â 
I Fidelity and Deposit Company of Mary
land to pay the same, to institute an ac
tlon against it and Augustus C. Widber, i
j in a court of competent jurisdiction and â 
j in the name of the proper party plaintiff,
to recover the amount of the public j
moneys misappropriated by said Widber
I during his term of office.
Fresh trouble is in store for the sure
ty company unless AVidber's bond is
made good, as will be seen from the
subjoined self-explanatory dispatch
from Insurance Commissioner Clunie: ;
CHICAGO, May 1, IS9B.
Hon. James D. Phelan, San Francisco:
Have just learned of the outrageous atr
I tempt of the security company to escape >
! liability. You can say to the company i
' that unless payment is made at once I
I shall revoke its license to do business in
California. If necessary, communicate
! with me here care Continental Insurance ;
i Company. ANDREW J. CLUNIE.

j pose of perfecting arrangements for the

j that famous American victory-
President W. G. Badger of the Bunker
I Hill Association presided and the prin-
c ipal business of the evening was listen
ing to and accepting the reports of the
| various committees.
A. O. Perkin3, chairman of the grounds
committee, reported that a contract had
been entered into with the Southern Pa
cific Company whereby the railroad was
to furnish two special trains to take the
various associations and their friends to
Bunker Hill Park at Los Gatos, where
the celebration will be held.
The citizens of Los Gatos, headed by
Mr. Berriman, the president of the local
Board of Trade, will act as a committee
of reception.
A letter was received and read from
Charles L. Pierce, division commander of
the Sons of Veterans, in which he ac
cepted the invitation to participate which
had been offered him, and notified the as
sociations that ail the different divisions
of the Sons of Veterans throughout the
State would be notified of the courtesy
that had been extended them.
President Badger was asked to request
of the Secretary' of War the usual salute
on the day of the anniversary, and he
will also request all of the citizens of the
city having flags to raise them as an evi
dence of their patriotism.
S. G. Cheever. Henry Euler, George
Colton and Charles Seley, comprising the
committee on resolutions, drafted resolu
tions of congratulation on the great vic

CALIFORNIA READY TO AID
THE SICK AND WOUNDED
THE parlors of the California Ho
tel were not large enough to con
tain the men and women, or rath
er women and men, who respond
ed last night to the rail of the presi
dent of the Sanitary Commission and
Red Cross League Besides San Fran
cisco's patriotic ritizens. there were
delegates from Berkeley and Oakland
Red Cross societies, and representa
tives from various organizations, all
eager to enroll themselves under the
humanitarian banner with us or to be
come auxiliary to San Francisco's
league.
The main business of the mÂ«ettnflr
consisted in the appointment of an er
ecutive committee, composed of the
leading philanthropic women and the
foremost business men of the city.
This committee will meet on Wednesday
afternoon. May 4. at the home of Mrs.
John F. Merrill, its presiding officer, on
the northeast corner of Van Ness ave
nue and Washington street, at 3.30
o'clock. The committee will decide up
on a place of business centrally lo
cated, upon the personnel of the va
rious sub-committees and upon the
plan of campaign to be acted upon at
once.
The most enthusiastic of last night's
orators were worn eh. They even re
proached the men with a lack of patri
otic ardor. But a hearty "We're all
right!" from the rear brought about
a better understanding.
Berkeley's High School is the first
upon the roster of auxiliary members
of San Francisco's league. Her three
representatives present last night were

brimming with enthusiasm. They are
thoroughly acquainted with the course
pursued by the national association
and are ready to fall in line.
Although various plans were dis
cussed, it seemed to be the general
opinion that the Red Cross League and
Sanitary- Commission of California
owes its first duty to California's sons.
After that is the nation, and then the
suffering at large â to Spain Itself, if
the war shall be prolonged and the
Red Cross Commission find itself in
the field. The surgeon- general of Cali
fornia was present to answer questions
from those interested in supplying the
needs of the Sanitary Corps of the Na
tional Guard â pressing needs, if our
men should be called upon, which it
will take $9000 to satisfy. Contribu
tions toward making up that $9000 were
offered last night, and as soon as the

Whole Family Cured of

My wife had on her limbs five small pimples
that began to enlarge, developing into eating
ulcers, which, despite efforts to cure them,
grew -worse, eating to the bone. "With two
bottles of Coticura Resolvent, one box of
CcrricrÃA (ointment), and one cake of Crm-

I was afflicted with papular rash, from
â¢which I could not rest day or night. My skin
became in a very bad fix. Cuticdka Keme-

loyal woman who addressed the meet
ing last night, "as though we had
shouldered muskets and marched away
with the soldiers from the Presidio,
who are already at the front."
The president of the commission as
sured those present that not one dollar
of the sum to be contributed should be

ORGANIZED FOR
FUTURE DUTY.
Oakland Red Cross Society
Prepared for Active
Service.
OAKLAND, May 2.â The impetus and
encouragement given the Red Cross or
ganization of this city yesterday by the
enthusiastic and popular ovation at
the First Congregational Church was
felt at the meeting held this morning
at the Ebell rooms, to discuss ways and
means for future work. The attend
ance was large, considering that no
formal request had been sent any or-
ganizatlon to send delegates.
Mrs. G. S. Abbott, the society's
president, said in calling the meeting to
order: "This movement has been so
spontaneous that it has been impossible
to organize until to-day. Your names
and addresses are now being taken in
order that you may be hastily called
together in case of need. That time
may never come, but we must be ready
in case it does. We desire the enroll
ment of every loyal woman and man
too, under the banner of the Red Cross.
The blanks will be carried by all dele
gates and officers of this society and
may be found in M. S. Smith & Son's
store on Broadway. It reads as fol
lows:
"Desiring to co-operate with the
charitable and humane purposes of
the International Red. Cross Society, j
for the relief of the suffering, and to
mitigate the distress of the afflicted,
whether by war or famine, flood or
pestilence, we cheerfully enroll our
names as members of the branch of i
the Red Cross Society, organized in !
Oakland.
"We therefore declare ourselves as
ready to serve our country to the !
best of our ability, with such dona
tions of money, food, clothing or
medical supplies as our society may
be called upon to furnish.
"We have moved slowly, conserva
tively, not full of enthusiasm to die out.
Yeaterd&y showed public opinion. It j
was not a Red Cross meeting, although j
the work was touched upon by every
speaker. We must have a Red Cross
meeting where women can be heard.
The work cannot be done without the
men, but women can talk."
The question of the financial needs
was then presented for discussion, and
brought forth some very pertinent re
marks. Following are the names of
some of the speakers and their opin- I
ions:
Mrs. Amy Requa-Lang, wife of Cap- j
tain Lang of the First United States
Infantry-â Take what is offered us for |
running expenses and a reserve fund,
but do not ask for money until we are
called upon for it.
Miss Ray Frankâ "ln time of peace
prepare for war," Action has already
begun and we may have needs soon.
Mrs. Albert Millerâ l know the people
of this State, of this county, and I know
that any call made upon them will find
a ready response. We want no en
tertainments nor dances. We are ready
to give.
Mrs. J. G. Lemon â This is a perma
nent organization. California has had
none like It and any funds left on hand
will always be needed. It is a move
ment for times of peace as well as for
times of war.
Mrs. Franklin Bangsâ It is useless to
have burdens of a lot of money on Â°ur I
hands. We only need enough to pay
our expenses. Any call made will uÂ«- .
met with a spontaneous answer. Have j
a reserve fund as large as possible of j
medical supplies and necessary band
ages.
Mrs. F. B. Ginnâ Wait until we are
called upon; when called upon we'll not
wait.
It was announced that the Ebell So
deLv ha 4 donated the use of their rooms 1
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 3, 1898.
and appropriated $20 to be used in pre
liminary expenses. The Sequoia Chap
ter of Daughters of the Revolution also
gave the organization $20.
The ladies are exceedingly anxious
for the public to understand that this
is not an Ebell Society adjunct. They
being an organized body of women took
the initiative, but there their part
stopped. While many of their members
are interested and have joined as indi
vidual members, it is easy to see from
the following list of officers and the
executive committee that they are in
no way controlling it. The officers, to
gether* with the delegates from various
organizations, constituted an executive
board as follows:
President, Mrs. G. S. Abbott; secre
tary Mrs. J. G. Lemon; assistant, Miss
Mary Keene; tr-asurer, D. Edwards

Military medical methods â Not ap
pointed. Other delegates from local or
ganizations should report as soon as
appointed to Mrs. Abbott, 118 Eleventh
street.
The question of organizing the school
children was considered and brought
before the assemblage on motion of
Mrs S. M. Martin, Mrs. Dr. Myra
Knox, a member of the Board of Edu
cation said: "I doubt the wisdom of
this move. It will greatly interfere
with their school work and should not
be allowed."
Miss M. E. Bab'son responded: "It
would break **"**r hearts if they were
not allowed to participate in this
work." *
Mrs. J. G. Lemon said she remem
bered the "Inconvenient misunder
standing" and it was her greatest hap
piness that she had been permitted to
send needed articles to the sick and
wounded soldiers.
Superintendent MeClymonds of the
City Schools said: 'The limit of the
amount of patriotism being taught in
the Oakland schools is the limit of the
patriotism of the corps of teachers from
the Superintendent down. If any one
in this city can tell us a better way we
are ready to learn it. You will appre
ciate Dr. Knox's position when you
realize that every new thing seeks the
pupils of our public schools as a method
of introduction. The conservatism of
the Board of Education is owing to this
fact. We are teaching patriotism in
the schools and we can teach human
ity through the Red Cross. Ido not
believe it will interfere with the school
work, if you ask them to organize and
await instructions. The organization
will satisfy them for the present. The
Bchools are bound to be disturbed as are
all lines of business by war. We don't
want to get up any undue excitement,
but if we are ready and it becomes nec
essary to do any work, all well." It
was decided to ask all of the schools to
organize auxiliary branches and re
quest them to send delegates to the
executive board. Miss Thompson, of
, the Lincoln School, who organized the
first Junior Branch and Miss Marion
Walsh, its vice-president, were present
during the session.
Miss C. P. Leit, of the Alameda
County Teachers' Association, an
nounced that a special meeting had
been called for Saturday morninsr to
discuss the formation of auxiliary
branches.
Miss Holt of Mills College brought the
greeting of Mrs. Mills and thirty-five
young ladies who desired to co-operate
in any wp-- possible.

auxiliary.
READY NOW
FOR WORK.
The California Red Cross
Society Prepared for
Duty.
The California Red Cross Society is now
well organized. No funds to carry on the
work the society proposes to do have yet
been called for, but already $261 in cash
and promises that are as good as cash
have been given the executive officers.
The Grand Parlor of Native Sons, while
in session at Nevada City a few days ago,
gave $100 of that amount, and last night
A. Mack of the firm of Mack & Co. added
another $100. A lady who desired not to
be known handed the president $20 at last
night's meeting. Mrs. William Alvord
sent a check for $20 to the treasurer a
few days ago, and Mrs. A. Goodman of
111 Turk street followed Mrs. Alvord's
example. Miss Isabelle Dennison, a little
girl of San Mateo, was the first of the
contributors to the fund, and as soon as
the society was first formed she sent a
big, round dollar to help the work of
humanity that the organization has de
cided to perform.
As soon as the meeting was called to
order last night Mrs. Herrington, the
president, announced the appointment of
the following executive committee: Mrs.
John F. Merrill, Mrs. Louis Sloss, Mrs.
J. G. Clark, Miss Hanilin, Miss Dimond,
Mrs. L. L. Dunbar. Mrs. P. Lilienthal,
Mrs. W. H. Mills, Mrs. A. N. Town?, Mrs.

Rabbi Voorsanger and Dr. Hanson.
The ladies of the above committee will
meet on Wednesday afternoon at the res
idence of Mrs. John F. Merrill, 1732 Wash
ington street, at 3:30 o'clock, to decide on
some plan for the ladies to work on to
carry out the plans of the organization.
The gentlemen of the committee are ex
pected to be present if It is possible for
them to do so. Rev. Father Wyman will
arrange for a meeting of the gentlemen
of the. committee to prepare some plan of
action for the men to pursue at a time
wnen it is convenient for the men to
meet. Sub-committees will be appointed
from both branches of the committee and
between the two some plan for interesting
all the societies and organizations in the
city will be arranged.
Rev. John Coyle, who represented the
High School Red Cross Society of Ber
keley, proposed that all the organizations
of the State that are now formed and
that might hereafter be organized should
work under one central body, and he
asked that the society now assembled as
sume the central body and that arrange
ments be made so that there should be
co-operation with similar bodies all over
the State. He nsked that the society he
represented be permitted to be the first to
place its organization on the roster of the
Red Cross Society of California-
Miss Ray Frank was present as a dele
gate from the society recently organized
in Oakland. She said she came to offer
the co-operation of the organization on
the other side of the bay.
A. Mack of Mack & Co. had little to
say, but he wanted to offer to the Red
Cross some substantial aid in the way of
giving $100 toward the fund of carrying on
the Rood work.
J. B. Stetson asked for information
about the Red Cross Society and the work
it was to do.
Dr W. D. McCarthy of the sanitary
corps of the National Guard replied that
there was great need of medical equip
ment for the soldiers who are now being
called out. The National Guard was defi
cient if it should be called upon to he put
on a war footing, and there was every
prospect that it would be.
Mrs J. G. Lemon further informed the
meeting that California should have a
permanent organization of the Red Cross.
It is a. great power for good work in time
of peace or in war. We should have an
auxiliary to the national society and
stand ready to be called to help in reliev
ing want and suffering from no matter
what cause. In times of floods or great
fires that are almost national calamaties
we should be ready to assist in giving
relief. The Red Cross Is one of the broad
est charities on the face of the earth.
Professor Bacon of Berkeley also of
fered some Information of the work that
might have to be done by the society.
"The present war," he said, "might now
be almost at a close. Next weeik may see
the last battle that may be fought in the
present struggle, but when it is over we
will have Cuba on our hands. It will
be an island of desolation and suffering.
We have taken a great moral responsi
bility on ourselves and the Red Cross will
be called on to succor a people left far
more desolate than those left in the trail
of even the most barbaric war ever
fought." â
"We need aid for the suffering Cubans
and for our own boys who might be called
to the front at "once," said Rev. Dr.
Foute. "We should at once commence to
prepare to give it in a systematic way.
and I would propose that funds be at once
collected to equip the regiments that may
be called from this coast with ail thÂ«
necessities and supplies they may re
quire."
Dr. Hopkins, surgeon-general of thÂ«
National "Guard, in reply to questions
said that about $!*OO would be required tc
provide the 40<*> men who have been called
from this State with all that they ur
gently needed to fit the medical corps fqi
a campaign.
After all the discussion a resolution waj
adopted to the effect that the society
agree to lend its efforts to supply thÂ«
California reglmpnts with their needs foi
their proper sanitary care, and that th<
organization be known as the California
Red Cross Society.
Addle Ballou, who represented Martha
Washington Council, Daughters of Lib
erty, asked that the council be enrolled
second on the roster of the society.

HUNTINGTON
WORKED HARD
FOR NOTHING
He Explains That Pacific
Roads Are Only a Bur=
den to Him.
Professes Willingness to Tell Every=
thing and Volubly Fails
to Tell It.
C. P. Huntington appeared before the
Railroad Commissioners yesterday and ad
mitted without reservation that he was
president of the Southern Pacific. He
indicated a cordial willingness to admit
other things, and may yet have the op
portunity, as the inquiry was hardly
more than opened when it was cut short
by adjournment until 10 o'clock this morn
ing. Mr. Tuntlngton was on the stand
from 1 o'clock until 3:45. At the end of
this period he was somewhat weary, the
shorthand man had a mass of notes and
the spectators were ready for a rest.
Of course it is generally understood that
the Commissioners are acting under a
decision lately given by Judge Morrow of
the United States Circuit Court. They j
are given statutory power to fix rates, j
but not until the company at interest
shall be making a profit. Judge Morrow
declared that it was competent for them
to find why the company was not making
a profit; if the earnings were being di
verted to the corruption of courts, Legis- j
latures, newspapers or individuals; that if |
this could be shown to be the case, the |
power of the Commissioners still inhered, j
The first endeavors in the direction of j
ascertaining the facts had been balked
temporarily by an injunction, and that
Judge Morrow dissolved the injunction
was the circumstance which made possi
ble the proceedings of yesterday.
C. P. Huntington is an impressive in
dividual. When he entered the room
there was a ripple of excitement. Faith
ful attendants were with the man of
many millions. H. E. Huntington was at
his elbow, Dave Neagle, known as a gun
tighter, was close by; "Old Pard" lias
sett brought a farmer-like presence into
the scene, and glowered upon Hunting
ton, who either did not know or did not \
care. The President sat at the end of a ;
long table. On one side were ranged the I
members of the commissionâ La Rue,
Clark and Hinton. La Hue sat in the
center and asked the questions from an
extensive list prepared in advance. Clark
said nothing. As to whether he sawed
wood there was no evidence. Hinton did
not often speak, but when he did he
demonstrated that he was watching the j
trend of the occasion, and was anxious to j
get just the kind of information Hunting- !
ton was anxious not to give.
There were many little by-plays which i
were interesting. These did not appear |
as answers to direct questions, but were i
thrown in by the witness or by Hinton. j
Mr. Huntington adverted 'several times to!
his sense of gratification at being able to
enlighten the commission, and Mr. Hinton
intimated that if the witness would only
tell all they had a right to know the sense
of joy would be mutual. The absence of I
a lawyer -or of somebody accustomed to I
examination of witnesses was noticeable.
Attorney Genera.l Fitzgerald had been
there at the opening, but he withdrew, as I
the Commissioners thought they could get
through without him. Mr. Huntington j
adjusted his skull cap, got the head of his I
cane where he could consult it readily, |
took the oath administered by President |
La Rue, and was ready to be interrogat
ed. Previous to this the resolution under
which action was to be taken had been
read. According to this resolution action
had been set for May 11, but at the re
quest of the witness the time i-ad been
advanced.
In a voice not particularly strong or
clear Mr. Huntington explained the
status of the Southern Pacific It was a
company operating many roads, but or
ganized particularly for the operation of
j lines in the West. Its stock was, the wit
ness thought, he was not sure, about
$150.00 > 000. of which about $120,000,00") had
been issued. The present value of the
j stock was 12 or 13 cents. The road had no
j income, that is, it earned no dividends. It
never had earned dividends, and if the
rates were to be cut it never would. The
witness detailed how various minor lines
had been absorbed, but the attempt to get
him to state the value of these lines was
a failure. They had been secured in ex
chanpp for Southern Pacilic stock, the
proportions being different in different
instances. Sometimes ten shares of stock
' had been secured for six of the Southern
; Pacific, and sometimes the stock obtained
had been worth more per share than the
stock given for it.
But in trying to find out what any par-
I ticular piece of property had been worth
I at the time of purchase or absorption, or
its worth at present the commissioners
were utterly baffled. "It had no market
value" was the invariable reply. If
as.^ed its worth now he would say that it
had nn market value, not being for Bale.
"If any one wanted to buy it," he contin
ued, "we might fix a price." But he gave
out the impression that nobody would
want to buy anything which had to be
operated at a loss. It was a peculiar fact
brought out during the examination that
no matter what had been the market
value of a stock, when once embraced in
the Southern Pacific system it lost that
value and became part of the load that
Huntington and his associates were car
rying There was no explanation as to
why they persisted in making this load
Mr Hinton persisted in knowing how
certain individuals had seemed to acquire
so much property from the Southern Pa
cific- but he did not find out. Mr. Hunt-
Ineton informed him that no money had
ever been made out of a California road,
that the builders of the Pacific lines did
not receive from the Government a suf
ficient subsidy to reimburse them that he
himself had put large sums Into these
roads in the hope of some day making
them valuable and getting the money out
At this point Hinton was observed to
It was suggested to Mr. Huntington that
when the stock of the Southern Pacific
was exchanged for other stock the gentle
men manipulating the transaction must
have had an idea as to the relative values.
The suggestion was lost upon the witness.
He sought still to establish his point that
the Southern Pacific was a burden. He
had worked for many years, had put
much effort into the building of this sys
tem, and his reward in his old age was a
road which had never paid anything and
the income of which, pitiful as it was. un
grateful people were anxious to curtail.
He told how he had worked as a boy on
a farm, but this was incidental nnd not
directly drawn out by anything that had
been asked him. "I am not so young as
I was seventy years ago," he remarked, in,
brackets.
The examination would have possessed
no element of interest except for the ex
cursions taken by the witness, and al
though these might be wholly irrelevant,
he was never checked, but came back to
the subject in his own good time.
"I am very glad." he said once, "to be
able to tell all about the Southern Pa
cific There seems to be a misunderstand
ing in relation to it." Yet, stripped of
extra words, all he told about it was that
it was a struggling corporation, to which
good men had devoted their lives and for
tunes, getting no return. He distinctly
averred that he had never made a cent
out of the Southern Pacific. He had nut
money into it, hoping and praying that
there would some time be a return. He

told what had been dope for the State.
Land in the San Joaquin Valley had been
given a value of $50 an acre where it had
had a value of $5 or less. Everybody had
made money by the building of the South
ern Pacific except the men who had built
it. Even the narrow-gauge line to Santa
Cruz was not profitable. The witness saw
that this statement created a ripple of un
faith, and repeated it. The second ripple
was of a similar character.
only once did -Mr. Hiuuinprton decline
to give information. This was In regard
to the Mexican International, which he
said had nothing to do with the Southern
Pacific, but was an independent enter
prise. When he was shown that it figured
In the last annual report us a part of the
Southern Pacific, he was surprised and
expressed a willingness to tell .'ill h^ knew
about it. The r.sult was that while he
talked for several minutes lie pave abso
lutely no information. He was not quite
certain; the books would have to be
consulted; he had forgotten this and that.
So the commission gained nothing. He
related how the Morgan line had been
snapped up at a bargain. Morgan had
died and the widow wanted to dispose of
the property "I got it at a bargain,"
said the witness, "paying only $7..J00,000
for it." Thus he spoke throughout of
millions as another man might have
spoken of dollars.
Inquiry developed the fact that the Mor
gan line's found their way into the South
ern Pacific: that the stock was reckoned
then at $150 a share, but that when it be
came part of the great corporation which
Iluntington carries as a load the stock
of the road remained at the same old
level; the owners still worried about the
certainty of daily bread. Not only haÂ«l
Mr. Huntington made no money out of
Pacific roads, but he did not know that
anybody fdse had. All the money the
roads had earned had been put back in
them so as to Increase the earning capac
ity. Any cut of rates was out of the ques
tion. It* would inevitably result in cutting
the wages of labor, to the payment of
which fio per cent of the income was now
devoted. "I am close to the laboringmun."
said Mr. Huntington. "I would be sorry
to do this."
There were many questions which, while
necessary, were not of public interest.
There were many more bits of personal
history which, while not necessary, were
of public interest. Mr. Huntington de
tailed the fact that in building up the
system he had handled $300,000,000 and in
dividually had not made a cent. He ex
tolled the high character of those who
had engaged in the work with him. their
unselfish endeavor, their lack of reward.
Finally he was asked the â <!ilue of the
Southern Pacific, and just here Hinton
interjected something about watered
stock. But Mr. Huntington would not ad
mit the watered stock, and claimed that
the stock and bonds outstanding repre
sented the value of the road.
The sum f.f the testimony so far has
hren that the Southern Pacific is a com
bination of hard-working men struggling
to make a living, and sadly handicapped
by the determination of th^ public for
w : hosc sole benefit the concern is run, to
cut down the rates, which are already so
ruinously low that -with difficulty is the
wolf kept from the Huntington door.
LOOKING FOR
SPEEDY SHIPS
Prompt Decision of the Gov
ernment to Re-enforce
Dewey.
Indication That ths Australia and
Gaelic Will Bo Char
tered.
Evonts of world-widp importance which
must immediately follow Commodore
Dewpy's magnificent conquest at Manilla
are destined to bring San Francisco into
prominence as the base of operations on
the Pacific. Coal for the cruisers and
supplies of all kinds for the squadron in
Asiatic waters will be shipped from this
port. Already San Francisco is dividing
honors with New York and Key West as
a point of prominence from a naval and
military reckoning.
Yesterday and last night the wire con
necting the Navy Department in Wash
ington and navy headquarters In this
city were busy transmitting important
messag.es concerning the employment of
a swift expedition to convey to Commo
dore Dewey supplies of fuel, food and
ammunition.
George H. Griffing, pay Inspector United
States navy, was directed by the Secre
tary of the Navy to charter two of the
speediest steamships at this port for im
mediate dispatch to Hongkong. This mes
sage signifies that the President and Cab
inet have resolved to sustain Commodore
Dewey in holding the advantages gained
by the valor and nerve of his gallant
squadron. At this time no one can fore
shadow the. complications that may arise
in the occupation of the Philippine Islands,
but the fact Is obvious that naval opera
tions, on the Pacific are to cut a much
larger figure In the calculations of the
campaign than many of the commanders
first imagined.
The swiftest steamers of large class in
this port at present are the Australia
and the Gaelic. It Is highly probable that
the Government will demand the services
of both. Negotiations for the charter of
the Australia were entered into vesferday
between John D. Spreckels Bros. & Co.
and Pay Inspector Griffing. The points at
issue necessarily involved free interchange
of ideas and figures over the wires.
The Gaelic Is owned by English parties
and is chartered by the O. and O. Com
pany.
Robbery and Burglary.
Emil Leonard, the one-armed footpad,
who has been terrorizing the vegetable
gardeners in the M:.- ion diptriot. was
booked at the City Prison yesterday on
charges of burglary and robbery. On April
3 he entered the residence of Guiseppi
Oasaretto. Thirty-first and Clement av
enues, and stole a quantity of Jewelry
and $fi in coin. O n April 21 he broke into
the house of S. Kayo, near Ingleside. and
at the point of a gun robbed the occupant
of $17 50.
Seriously Injured.
Fred R<nm. a carpenter, workinp on a
I building In course of construction at Tay- ,
| lor and Washington streets, met with a j
j serious accident yesterday morning. He â¢
; was carrying a heavy pirre of timber on |
1 his shoulders, when his foot Slipped and ;
' he fell, the piece of timber striking him ;
ion the head. He was taken to the Re- |
j celvlng Hospital, where it was found that Â«
i his skull was fractured and that his j
j chances of recovery were doubtful.
