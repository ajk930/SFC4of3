KAPA, CaL, .Tan. 26.â T0-day has
been a busy day for hoth the prosecu
tion and the defense in the Clark case.
District Attorney Bell and Marshal
Johnson have spent the day over in
pope Valley hunting up evidence per
taining to the life of the Clarks years
Bgo.
Sheriff MoKenzie is taking all pos
sible precautions to prevent th^ mur
derer falling into the hands of a mob
should the St. Helenans be afflicted
with a relapse of the lynching fever,
v.-hich raged violently in the little town
Bix or eight years ago. This evening
the Sheriff received a message from St.
Helena advising him that the feeling
against Clark there is at euch a pitch
as to make a guard for the murderer
absolutely necessary. Two deputies
â¢will be seated in the team that takes
Murderer Clark's Clumsy Attempt to Manufacture Evidence
in Advance.
the Sheriff and the murderer cm their
early morning drive from here up in the
teeth of the north wind to St. Helena-
There is a possibility also of an extra
load of officers accompanying them,
and still other deputies will meet the
team upon its arrival.
The prisoner's attorney left for St.
Helena on to-night's train that he
might in person go over the few blocks
of territory whioh have been dia
gramed and searched and studied. It
was suggested to Attorney Hogan that
a body guard for himself might be a
proper precaution, for the reason that
St. Helena folk might visit their dis
pleasure upnn any man who would un
dertake the defense of such a creature
as Clark.
The lawyer shouted with indignation:
"I'll take a shotgun with me. That's
what I'll do."
However, there is evidently a decided
difference of opinion as to the state of
St. Helena's pulse, and peace officers,
, "who are the doctors in the case, cannot
agree. District Attorney Bell tele
phoned down -from St. Helena to-night
to The Call correspondent that all
lynching talk is nonsense; that Sheriff
McKenzie Is completely mistaken in
his diagnosis of St. Helena's case; that
the patient is sane and healthy and
thoroughly cured of the old lawless
malady, and, furthermore, that she re
ppnts being called a mob-sick town,
when she Is peaceable, respectable and
law-abiding as she was not once upon
en old and ought to be forgotten time.
Clark grows uneasy as the time ap
proaches for him to face the people of
Si. Helena with his plea of not guilty.
He decided not to attend the Inquest
upon his murdered brother when thÂ»
Sheriff warnod him of the uncertain
temper of his townspeople, but to-mor
row's trip is not a question of Clark's
inclination. Then, too, he has heard
no word in answer to his telegram to
his father, and as each hour that passes
Isolates him more completely from hu
man sympathy he become a more an(l
more pitiable spoetaclo, with his wor- :
ried, unshaven face and troubled dark
eyes beneath their queer-shaped brows.
Of late he has not askod for minis
terial consolation. He says religious
people "have gone back" on him.
There are on file in St. Helena twen
ty-flve affidavits from residents of St
Helena and Pope Vali ey affirming
George Clark's sanity. The prosecu
tion is preparing to meet that defense

CLARK'S FIRST CONFESSION.
NAPA, Jan. 26.â 1t has come to light that Murderer Clark practi
cally confessed his guilt to the Salvation Army Sunday afternoon. To a
Call representative this evening Captain W. A. Vandyke, of the
local corps, said: "At 5:30 Sunday afternoon myself. Lieutenant E.
E. Kailley and a few lassies held service in the cell with Clark.
We all got on our knees. Clark was very much unnerved, but he
seemed happy in our companionship, and, knowing us to be Chris
tians and true friends, became exceedingly confidential. He appeared
to form a particular attachment for me and gave me words unso
licited that led me to believe him guilty.
"T said to him: 'Now, Brother Clark, don't tell anything that
is other than truthful. If you are a Christian you will not speak
falsely, no matter whether it damages you or not.'
"He replied that h*Â» would tell the truth and nothing but the
truth. Then he started in to admit that he had murdered his
brother, and had made a partial confession when Jailer Kennedy en
tered the cell. Immediately he stopped and I did not ask him to go
on. Then I asked him to pray and he complied. Imagine my sur
prise when he told the Lord he was an Innocent man. I said noth
ing when he contradicted in prayer, nor have I nor any of the army
spoken of the matter for publication until now. lam positive that
had the jailer remained away a few minutes longer Clark would
have made a complete confession to me."
OJeorge Clark dignifies as "wits." A man
who has no more caution than to dis
pose of an incriminating bottle which
has contained strychnine used in a
double attempt to poison his brother
by throwing it into a bush only ten
f>et from his cabin door had better
forswear the difficult profession of
murderer and take to lecturing upon
"Easy Ways to Be Found Out."
The prosecution, though, is not in
clined to belittle Clark's mental en
dowment. They claim that there's too
much method in this man's madness,
only they don't believe it is madness.
They think his sending that printed
anonymous letter to himself through
the postoffice with its warning that his
life was in danger, to account for his
buying a pistol, is too deliberately
planned an act to be classed as insane,
and they emphasize the fact that the
letter was sent unstamped so that
postage might be collected and so
make its receipt by Clark noteworthy.
They instance the murderer's calling
at his brothers house two and three
times daily after each attempt at pois
oning as the cruel, cold blooded malig
nance of a snake anxious to note
whether its victim still lives.
In answer to the threat of the de-
fense that the confession will never be
admitted in a "ourt it is the prosecu
tion's claim that they possess enough
circumstantial evidence to hang Clark
anyway.
The preliminary examination which
takes place Thursday morning Is to be
the event of the year at St. Helena.
As Justice Chirm's court room will ac
commodate but fifty people, the Jus
tice has offered District Attorney Bell
the use of Turner's Hall, that all St.
Helena and half the population of the
surrounding towns may witness the
spectacle of weak, miserable, cowardly,

WAR NOW ON
Chief Examiner Bailey Scores
the President of the
Commission.
In Return He Receives a Rather Se
vere Cnstigatlon at His Chiefs
Hands.
Special Plupatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON', Jan. Rev. E. D.
Bailey, chief examiner of the Civil Serv
ice Commission, submitted some sensa- ;
tional testimony at to-days session of
the Renate Civil Service Investigating
Committee. It was a sequel to the
charges he made on Monday of intimi
dation and interference by the commis
sion with his testimony.
He called attention to the bitter at
tack made on him by President Proctor
of the commission, and read a letter he
had addressed to Theodore Roosevelt,
the New York Police Commissioner, se
verely criticizing the commission.
President Proctor made a statement to
the commission regarding the charges
that he and the commission had sought
to intimidate witness Bailey. He said
that when he had spoken to Mr. Bailey
and told him that hitherto no one had
been subpenaed by the chairman of the
committee except those who were antag
onistic to the committee, he had in his
possession a duplicate copy of the com
munication to Mr. Roosevelt, submitted
to-day. It was furnished him by a
Linlted States Senator, and he did " not
know its author until the first testimony
of Mr. Bailey, when he suspected him. He
had known for some time that the paper
had been passed among Senators and
made the basis of an attack on the civil
service. He told Mr. Bailey that he sup
posed the latter had been subpenaed at
the instance of some Senator who had
Been the paper and that after the com
plaints were all in he would ask the com
mission to summon people who had long
experience in important positions in rela- ;
tion to the operation of the civil service
He had stated that he wished any one
having a knowledge of wrongdoing in the
commission would state all the facts, but
there was a line to be drawn between
that and a subordinate criticizing the ad
ministration of the commission and the
President and making suggestions.

Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 26.â 0n Satur
day evening the citizens of Los Ange
les will assemble in mass-meeting for
the purpose of receiving information
and instruction on the water question,
and to take such action as may seem
to them me<'t after they have had the
facts laid before them by the able gen
tleman who have accepted Invitations
to address the meeting.
The fart that the people of Los Ange
les have not been able to secure Infor
mation as to the water fight through
local newspaper channels, nwln? to the
policy of the throe syndicated dallies to
give-only such intelligence as Is In the
interest of the water monopoly and its
efforts t" defeat municipal ownership,
has rendered th^ callinc of the mass
meeting Imperative. The syndicated
dallies were puttinsr forth their every
effort to keep the people In ignorance
as to the real facts of the situation, by
misrepresenting tru^ friends of muni
cipal ownership to a marked depree.
But The Call entered the field and
laid bare the nefarious plot in all of Its
details, and the result has been a great
awakening:. The people are now up In
arms against the syndicate press, and
they, are In the field to> B<Â»e to: It that
the public servants -whom they elected
In December, 1896. proceed to carry out
their ante-election p>dges without fur
ther unreasonable delay.
As an evidence of the fact that the
populace 1s aroused It Is only neces
sary to refer to the mass meeting
which is going to bring forth an ex
pression from the men who represent
the bone and Binew of the city. Mayor
M. P. Snyder will deliver an address
In which he will take occasion to in
form the public p.p tr. his position In the
matter. This the lo<"al syndicate press
has never stated. Oouncilmon L. M.
Grider and E. L. Hutchison will also
tell briefly of the struggle they have
made In the Council to carry out their
pledges and of the difficulties th^y have
met with at the hands of the tools of
the corporation who are ensconced in
public office, and Judge C. <". Wright,
the author of the Wright irrigation act.
will speak, as will also F. H. Gill, the
president of the Los Angola County
Council of Labor: Ernest Abs Haeen.
the civil engineer: M. W. Conkling,
Proft-ss-or W. C Bowman, Milton Carl
son and others.
The programme is to have short,
pointed addresses, sr. that every citizen
who is present in the hall, after he
hears a full, fair and complete exposi
tion of the water issue, can go forth
as a lecturer and inform his brethren
of the course to be pursued in this mat
ter, which is to his interest and for the
benefit of the whole people.
Thus will the great work The Call
has undertaken to secure for the people
of this city possession and control of
their water plant and to protect them
from any $2,000,000 steal and from an
extension of the monopoly's franchise
he assisted. The meeting Is to be abso
lutely non-partisan in its character. It
is for the sole purpose of discussing
the water question and no other issue
will be permitted to come up. Music
Hall, on South Spring street, has been
selected as the place of meeting.
The Log Angeles Times has, by si
lence, pleaded g-ullty to the charge
made against It by The Call of purposely
and intentionally deceiving the people
as to the water company's plant in a
page article appearing in its midwin
ter number. The paper, at that time,
s<_' forth an alleged map of a portion
of the company's system which was a
lie and a fraud upon the reading public.
It depicted mains which in size are not
In the positions Indicated In the alleged
map, and generally showed a system
which has never been built, but which
is a reproduction of a map in the City-
Engineer's office of a system proposed
for the municipality by Ernest Abs
Hagen, formerly the city's expert en
gineer. The Call has made this charge
of deception against the Times and has
stated that it was made intentionally
and purposely in behalf of the water
company to deceive the people and
lead them to believe that the corpora
tion had made Improvements to Its
plant, which It had not. The Times has
had three days to answer the charge,
but it has failed to respond In any way!
Among the ministers of the city the
water question is now attracting some
considerable attention. The Rev. Bliss
is delivering a series of lectures here
under the auspices of the Episcopal
Church, and almost every evening he
refers to the subject. This is exciting
considerable comment in religious cir
cles, as it is a departure from the or

So far as I am able to learn no offi

night that he had heard nothing from
Captain Wildes in relation to this par

"Happily Great Britain has the coun

United States, but the Japanese navy
is a factor of uncertain value."
An article in the Pall Mall Gazette
says: "The German fleet may be said
to hold the balance between England
and Japan and France and Russia. The
position or arbiter is the very thing
the Kaiser would desire, and with the
force he possesses In the far east he
can dictate terms.
"If the position Is really critical, we
run a grave risk in leaving our fleet

visited the Brooklyn Navy yard yester
day and Inspected Dry Dock No. 3. As
a result he is determined to see that
there is a thorough investigation In the
dock. Faults are so apparent, he de
clares, as to make it almost inconceiv
able that they were not discovered
while the work was in progress.
"If it should develop for any reason
that the deparmental investigation Is
not thorough enough to ascertain aJI the
facts and place the responsibility where
it belongs, there Is no doubt the matter
could be taken up by Congres."
There Is no desire In the Navy Depart
ment for congressional investigation.
There is no doubt whatever that Civil
Engineer A. G. Menocal will be court
martialed, as the officials have no rea
son to suppose he will make an explana
tion which will remove from his shoul
ders the responsibility for the defects.
The department also intends to look

PARIS, Jan. 26â Another turn has
been given to the Dreyfus affair by the
declarations of Baron yon Bulow in
the Reichstag. Le Petit Journal, Le
Oaulois, Le Journal, Le Soleil. Le Libre
Parole and L'Echo de Paris, all discuss
the matter this morning from this new
point of view.
The statement that Germany had
nothing to do with Dreyfus comes
eather as a surprise â in fact, is pretty
generally disbelievedâ although the j
Brussels correspondent of Aurore, Cle
menceau's paper, says that an official
in the foreign office there is authority j
for the following statement:
"If Dreyfus betrayed any secrets it j
was to Russia and not to Germany. Tf
the French Government refuses to :
speak." declares this Belgian dlplo- '
matipt, "it la because it would be com- j
pelled to accuse Russia and compro- j
mise an alliance so dear to the coun- j
try. Rather than do that," he adds,
"they would attempt a coup d'etat."
Le Petit Journal's article on the j
subject is a remarkable one. It says:
"Europe is beginning to think that
the French Government will soon be j
unable to suppress or keep back some
Statement liable to bring about a con
flict. Thin," it declares, "is the motive
which has prompted Baron yon Ru
low's statement in the Reichstag. Does
Germany fear or does she seek war?"
"In any case." Le Petiti Journal
says, "it Is not to the Interest of France
to let the matter go any further. Mod- j
era war is too terrible to be entered {
upon lightly. Although France is dan
gerously near the abyss, it is not yet
too late to pull up.
"That Germany intends to be in the
right is certain. She is taking her pre- !
cautions so as not to be caught un
awares."
In fact, according to Le Petit Jour
nal, she is repeating her tactics of 1870,
and the paper asks:
"Is French patriotism too dead #â >
lend her a helping hand by ending the j
agitation over the Dreyfus affair that !
has thrown the country into a ferment
for months, and can only serve Ger
many, which is looking for a casus
belli."

Call Office, Riggs House,
"Washington, Jan. 26.
There exists now no reasonable doubt
as to what prompted the sending: of the
Maine to Havana. Despite all the ef
forts of the pro-Spanish newspapers to
make it appear that De Lome was
overjoyed at the visit and that he was
cognisant of every movement, If he did
not actually suggest the visit as "an.
act of friendship," there is no dnubt
that the ship was sent in response to
the direct command of General Lee,
and that such demand was backed by
a threat to close the consulate and
leave the island unless prompt action
was taken.
Of course nobody familiar with the
situation there has believed for a min
ute the fairy tales that the State De
partment has been giving out. The
Maine had been placed at the disposal
of General Lee some time before, or
rather had been sent to the Florida
Keys with the idea that of the ships
of the navy she was most available for
this particular mission. It was given
out at the Navy Department that she
was to hold herself in readiness to re
spond to the request of the American
Consul General, but it seems that
statement was not literally correct, for
the orders under which the Maine went
to Havana were issued by Secretary
Long and sent from here. They
were sent in response to the de
mands of the Consul General made In
cipher telegrams sent by him to the
President direct.
Blanco had suddenly left Havana.
He had left on the day that anti-Amer
ican riots were scheduled to occur and
Havana was excited over reports of
Spanish defeats within a compara
tively short distance of Havana. Gen
eral Lee, who had kept the most prac
tical watch on developments, felt that
trouble was impending and the result
was his strong telegrams to the Presi
dent.
The President and members of his
Cabinet were at Secretary McKenna's
eating that farewell dinner when the
telegTams were hurried over to the
President. The contents of them were
made known and there was a sort of In
formal Cabinet meeting, at which it
was decided that the demand of the
Consul General must be promptly met.
De Lome, who is "foxy" enough to
find himself consulted on all matters
pertaining to the Cuban situation, was
sent for and met Secretary Long at the
State Department. The situation was
explained to him, and. so the story
goes, he protested vigorously, reiterat
ing what he had said a few days be
fore, that such action would be taken
by the Spanish as tantamount to a dec
laration of war. But, faced by the de
termination of the President to send
the ship and realizing that there would
be worse trouble if the President back
ed out and Lee made good his threat
and came home, he and the Secretary
of the Navy cooked up the pleasant
story about Spain's acquiescence.
This story has been so skillfully elab
orated by some of those papers which
have put themselves into the position
of being mouthpieces for De Lome
that it has been made to appear that
the Spanish Minister was not only de
lighted at the visit of the Maine but
that he actually suggested it himself.
Nothing quite equal to this for a fairy
story has been sent out from Washlng
ton for years. Of course it is natural
that the officials of the State and the
Navy departments should conceal the
real facts from the public. When they
did give out anything about the
Maine's trip across they carefully re
frained from telling the truth as to
the time of her departure from Florida
Bay and her arrival at Havana, There
la just as much truth In the statement2
that the visit is a friendly one. It is
friendly just so long as the Spanish
care to regard it as BUCO and conduct
themselves accordingly, but the mo
ment American rights in person or
property are assailed the Maine will
show her teeth; then look out for fun.
De Lome may continue t<> regard the
Maine's visit with Joy through his
newspapers, but at heart he sees in it
the beginning of the end. With this
start there seems little chance for the
administration to escape intervention
in Cuban affairs, however much Pres
ident McKinley may now deplore such
a step. It seems inevitable.
Secretary Long this morning re
ceived a telegram from Admiral Slcard,
Baying that the North Atlantic squad
ron had gone into tlr> inner anchorage
at Dry Tortugas. The telegram was
brought to Key West by the Fern.
which is serving as a dispatch and
supply boat for the fleet. The torpedo
boats in the vicinity of Key West are
under Admiral Sicard's orders, while
near the squadron, to stive also as dis
patch vessels and to give the vessels
some practice in the drills for repelling
lo attacks. This does not. how
Â« ver, interfere with the standing or
ders to Lieutenant-Commander Kim
ball, the commanding officer of the tor
pedo-boat flotilla, and the little craft
will continue on their cruise along the
coast as far west as Galveston, and
then, returning, go up the Mississippi
River iti the early spring. The Porter,
one of the fleet, sailed yesterday from
Port Tampa for Mobile in company
with the Ericsson, to be present at a
local celebration there, but they will
probably return to the squadron before
resuming their along-shore cruise.
SPANISH RADICALS IN
HAVANA DECLARE THEY
HAVE BEEN BETRAYED.
Blanco May Have to Seek the Maine's Pro-
tection in Case of Another
Outbreak.
Copyrighted, IÂ«9S, by James Oordon Bennett.
HAVANA, Jan. 26.â The last ripple
of visible excitement attending the ar
rival of the Maine died away this'morn
ing, and the ship as she lies at anchor
attracts no more attention than other
\ â¢ ssela in the harbor. The papers
made the briefest possible allusion to
her arrival and La Union Constitu
tional, the Conservative organ, prints
a Washington dispatch to the effect
that the visit of the Maine to Havana
is merely an act of courtesy, showing
the friendly feeling to Spain, and to
counteract Spanish utterances in Con
gress. La Union adds that the visit
will be returned by the Spanish ships
to American ports.
In spite of this there is a strong un
dercurrent of feeling in Havana, as is
evidenced by the excited talking last
night of angry groups assembled in the
cafes. The general impression among
al Spaniards is that the caus. <â¢â (
Plain has been betrayed by the Blanco
government, and the nation has been
humiliated by what they regard as the
first step in the direction of American
intervention.
This has intensified the hatred held
for General Blanco and his associates,
and for the cause of autonomy, and
this hatred may at any moment find
vent in an outbreak of fury in which
the memhi-r? of the Government may
be forced to depend for their personal
safety on the Maine, for, while their
peril is obvious, the troops concen
trated during the riots have been dis
persed and no new precautions have
been taken.
The radicals here say General Blanco
is playing his last card in his present
visit to the Eastern provinces, for the
purpose, it is said, of attempting to in
duce Generals Rabi and Salvador Kios
to lay down their arms. Both these
men refused to surrender at the close
of the last war, and the Cubans believe
them incorruptible. Before leaving Ha
vana on Monday General Blanco, it is
known, drew from the treasury $380,
000.
General Blanco received news that
an American warship would be ordered
to Havana while in Batabano, but did
rot delay sailing for the East. Yester
day he was in. Jucaro inspecting the
trocha, and to-day he went on to Man
zanillo. He Is expected to return at
the end of next week.
The Spanish account of the victory
of General Castellanos and the capture
of the headquarters of the rebel gov
ernment in the town of Esperanza is
now proved to have been a fabrica
tion. There is no such town as Es
peranza near Cubitas. The name of
the town founded and occupied as the
capital by the rebel government is
Agramonte. The Spanish troops are
unable to get near this place, being
repulsed in the mountains and forced
to retire with heavy lops.
The latest advices from Orient state
that the rebels are still besieging Hol
guin, and that the garrison cannot
possibly hold out without supplies and
re-enforcements. General Pando finds
It impossible to send these, alth'outrh
he is making desperate efforts to do so.
General Pando s army is still along the
banks of the Cauto River and strongly
Intrenched, but is unable to assume
the aggressive.
General Gomez shows no signs of
taking the field and conducting an ac
tive campaign. He states as his reason
that he is short of cavalry and cannot
operate successfully against the
Spaniards, who have plenty of horses.
At this rate the war in the east can
last for years.
In the western provinces, however,
the troops keep pretty well on the
move, but neither side has achieved
decisive results. General Molina had
what is called here an important battle
with rebel General Blancourt at Ca
marioca, Matanzas province, on Janu
ary 23. General Molina had 1500 in
fantry and 400 cavalry. He attacked
the rebel camp and there was fighting
for five hours, but finally he was
obliged to retire without success. The
loss on both sides was insignificant.
The rebels are still devoting their at
tention to preparing for the coming
wet season. Every day large quanti
ties of supplies of all sorts are sent to
them.
The first direct Interference of the
new Cuban colonial ministry in home
politics took the form of a telegram to
a Minister in Spain, begging him to
release Cuban prisoners in Ceuta in
honor of the King's name day. No re
ply has been received, but It Is ex
pected that the request will be
granted.
The American consulate is now pro
tected by a strong guard within and
without. This precaution is apparently
superfluous, as perfect tranquility
reigns. General Lee made an official
call on the Maine this afternoon.
CRUISER BROOKLYN TO
JOIN THE VESSELS OF THE
NORTH ATLANTIC SQUADRON.
Expected to Leave Brooklyn Navy -Yard
for the Gulf on Next
Sunday.
NEW YORK. Jan. 20.â A "Washington
special to the Herald says: The North
Atlantic squadron will bo augmented
next week by the cruiser Brooklyn, which
is expected to leave the Brooklyn Navy
Yard on Sunday for the Gulf. Orders
have been given to hasten the work of re
pairing: the ship. The battle-ship Maine
will shortly go to the drill grounds to
participate in maneuvers, but Secretary
Long told me to-day that the exact date
for her departure from Havana had not
been fixed. Another ship will go to Ha
vana to relieve the Maine.
The department was advised to-day
that the North Atlantic squadron had
gone into the inner anchorage at Dry
Tortugas. The torpedo-boats Porter and
Ericsson left Tampa yesterday for Mo
bile, where they will be docked, and
when they have rejoined the squadron
the Cushing and Dupont will be relieved.
It' is said that Rear- Admiral Slcard's
command will leave Dry Tortugas in a
few days and proceed to the drill ground
In the Gulf of Florida for target practice.
PACIFIC COAST
FIELD TRIALS
Some Clever Work Done
at Bakersfield by
Dogs.
One High-Strung Conine Runs
Away and Is Lost for
Two Hours.
Pointing and Retrieving Satisfactory
on the Wholeâ The Club
Elects Officers.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BAKERSFIELD, Jan. 26.â The third
> day of the Pacific Coast field trials was
very pleasant. After a drive of twelve j
| miles, a halt was called on entering a j
field profuse with sage without the
I onions. The first brace of dogs, Gleams
Kuth. handled by Dodge, and Luke,
handled by Couts, were cast off at 1:46
a. m., and they had not gone more than :
200 yards when they ran into birds in
! splendid cover. Luke was first to point,
' and was steady to shots. Luke re
trieved. Again Luke pointed, but the
bird flushed as the handler approached, j
Gleams pointed and Luke backed well. 'â 
Luke again drew on point and was
i beautifully backed. The birds were
acting very well and the performance j
I of the dogs was much admired. Gleams
pointed twice on running birds, but i
found his mistake and roaded several
yards, coming finally to a stanch point
| near a water ditch. The bird was
\ Hushed by the handler and killed.
I Gleams, steady to shot, retrieved the
I bird when ordered.
Luke again pointed stylishly, and the
! handler Hushed the bird, but did not
1 shoot. The dog was steady to wing, i
Several points were made by both dogs
on the margin of an old water ditch,
i but Luke was the more steady on
! points and showed better judgment in
reading and locating birds. Gleams
Ruth is certainly a very showy bitch In
the field, but Luke outclassed her in
pointing and locating game. The dogs
were ordered up at 10:30 o'clock.
The pointer Cuba, second prize win
; ncr of the Derby, hftndled by Dodge, ,
and the setter Yaliente. handled by
Walters, were cast off at 10:35 o'clock
lon new grounds. Valiente, a very high
strung dog from the City of Angels,
started off with the speed of a 2-year- |
old when ordered on, and was soon lost
from sight. His handler whistled and
called, but the long-distance canine pc- ;
destrian paid no heed to command and
on going. After three-quarters of
an hour's delay, the dog was given up
for lost, but a horseman discovered
Yoliente afterward two miles from
; where she was cast off.
In the meantime tho judges ordered
Countess X, handled by Dodge, and
Alex C, first prize winner of the Derby
and handled by Lucas, cast off. At
11:26 o'clock they went off at a merry
gait, but it was one hour before the
birds, which were found in the timber,
flushed to open ground. Alex was first
: to draw on point, stopping suddenly
in front of a small sagebrush when
traveling at high speed. Lucas kicked ,
the bird out and shot, but instead of '
keeping a close eye on his dog he
watched the spot where the bird fell. \
Alex broke and ran, and after covering
fifty yards of ground he pointed again
and Lucas shot and killed. This time
Alex was steady to shot, and held his
! position until ordered on.
While Alex was accomplishing good |
i work Countess X was ranging several \
| yards away and going over birds j
! which were afterward Hushed by the i
teams. Alex finally put up a hare and
: chased it a short distance, but stopped
{on a signal from the handler. After
! quartering some distance Alex again
j found birds which he roaded several .
! yards, bringing up to a stylish point
and was backed nicely by the Countess.
The birds flushed before the handler
! arrived.
Alex again drew on point and was
well backed, but the birds were run
ning and the pointer roaded them until
he reached the timber and heavy un
dergrowth, when the Judges ordered
the dogs up at 12:55 o'clock.
The Countess must have been off
badly In nose, as she failed to score a :
single point on birds during the heat.
At 1:30 o'clock Vallente, handled by;
Walters, and Cuba, handled by Dodge, I
were again cast off. After traveling
sume distance Cuba ran into birds and
dropped Hat on his stomach, but the
birds, alarmed by the approach of the
hunters, had moved. Cuba found his
mistake, and leaving his point roaded
some distance and again painted and
was beautifully backed. The handler,
on finding no game, ordered Cuba on.
Valiente, who was ranging to the left
of his opponent, came to a point and
was also beautifully backed. Cuba
again pointed, but soon discovered that
the bird had left. Again he drew on
and his tail stiffened. Vallente backed
nicely and the bird was flushed by the
handler. Both dogs steady to shot.
Vallente ranged some distance away
from Cuba and stiffened out. He was
steady to shot and retrieved well.
It was some time before a new covey
was Hushed from the trees. When they
scattered among the sagebrush Cuba
pointed well and was nicely backed.
Valiente was next to point and Cuba
rushed In and flushed the birds. Cuba
was now excited and flushing birds, but
a good talk from his handler steadied
him. Valiente again attempted long
distance racing and was severely
whipped by the handler. The hiding
had cowed him and his work after this
was poor, the dog having lost his dash.
The dogs were ordered up at 2:35
o'clock and Iroquois Chief, handled by
Dodge, and Peach Mark, handled by
Allender, were cast off at 2:40 o'clock.
Peach ranged well and quartered her
ground beautifully, but was rather
slow compared with other dogs. The
Peach made some very pretty points
and was invariably steady to shot. The
Chief acted very poorly, paying no at- j
tention to his handler, who annoyed the i
other dog by shouting and whistling
at the headstrong Chief, who paid more
attention to fur than to feathers. The
only redeemable feature in the Chief's
work was a stanch point he made c-n a i
bird when the trial was drawing to a
close. His handler was compelled to
drag him away from the beautiful posi
tion he had taken, and it was with the
greatest reluctance that his highnegs
cast himself away to other parts of the
field where long-eared rabbits were
numerous.
Dors wero ordered up at 3:35 p. m
Emmet Sullivan, owner of Dash An
tonia, purchased Peach Mark fr.Â»m
Gardner of Wells, Fargo & Co. She
was sold by her handler, Allcnder, for
$250. She will be bred to Dash Antonia.
Sadie Hopkins, a Portland (Or.) bitch,
handled by Guyse, had a bye with Lu
cas Wicklow. The dogs were cast off
at 3:40 p. m. Wicklow was out of form
and accomplished very poor work. He
was ordered up after being down lfaTT
an hour, and Sadie, single-handed, so
to speak, worked her ground very styl
ishly. She flushed some birds which
were lying close, but after being duwn
some time she redeemed herself by a
display of good judgment In locating

running birds and pointing stanchly.
She is a very pretty little bitch and
very stylish when in action, but her
pose is not the best. She was called up
! at 4:25 p. m., and this finished the day's
I trials.
Dogs that are cast off In the morn
ings and evenings have a great ad
vantage over those that are ordered
down in the middle of the day, when
birds are wild and hard to locate.
The dogs drawn for to-morrow ai-e:
N^nrod and Valiente: Luke and Cuba
of Kenwood; Dona Alicia and Peach
Mark; Dash Antonia and Alex C.
The election of officers for the ensu

WESTERN BIRDS
WIN THE MAIN
Mackin's Gamecocks Score a
Notable Victory at
Chicago.
Defeat a Crack Massachusetts String
When the Battle Seemed
Lost.
Ppeolal Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO. Jan. 26.â The great national
cocking main, held Tuesday night and
the greater part of Wednesday night in
Herman's Winter Resort at Bluff Lake,
attracted a crowd of sports, most of
whom came frÂ«>m Boston, Providence and
other New England towns. A blizzard
came on after the start was mad.' from
Chicago and once the party was landed
at the place where the pit was arranged
it could not get away. The time was well
I>ut in, however, and many rattling bat
tles were fought, th<* majority of which
were won by Western birds. The main
was for $2500 a side on the odd, and was
won against an almost hopeless lead.
When time was called fifteen birds fell
in, fighting at up and down weights, top
to li^ht alternately, with one and one
founh to one and one-half inch gaffs.
Mackin, on the toss up of a coin, won the
choice and selected for the first battle a
gray green grade of Jap sent to him by
Green a breeder of Sacramento.
Like all other birds sent him by Green
there were six of themâ this proved cra
ven, and, after losing four successive
lights to a man from Plackstone, Mass.,
Mackin withdrew the Japs.
Mackin never got a look-in until the
fifth light. Casey's favorite strain of
roundheads won the first four off the re.-!,
and it began to look blue for the Chicago
birds .".ml sports. After the fourth en
gagement Ma< kin refused to handle any
more of the Sacramento fowls and sent in
his own breed.
This turned the tide. The fifth went to
Mackin. the sixth to a Massachusetts
bird, the seventh to the local man and
th<- eighth to the Easterner. The score
then stood six victories against two in
fav>r of the Bay State, and it looked like
any kind of money against counterfeit
coin that the big main would be won by
Casey.
It was at this Juncture that the re
markable change set in. Mackin's last
bird, a blue-red Huddleston cross, hail
gone wrong and the ninth bird brought
out of the coop of the /Chicago man was
a brown-red, five pound twelve and three
quarter ounce bird that had won the
seventh fight. He was a game one. and
though badly wounded went in and won
handily enough. From that point, on
Mackin never again lost a battle, win
ning eight out of fourteen battles fought
and six of them in succession. The score
of the main follows:
East ....11110101000000
Total won, 6; lost, 8.
West ....0 0001010111111
Total won, 8: lost, 6.
The result was a great surprise to the
Eastern m^n. The same strain of birds
had won for Casey twenty-two straight
victories without a break, and to lose the
twenty-third, after having It wÂ«Â»ll in
hand, was a stunner. ConditionlnV and
strain told, however, and Maekin won
only because he had the better warriors.
NEW THIRTY-SIX-HOUR RECORD.
PITTSRURG, Jan. 26.â The record for
thirty-six hours in a Eeventy-two-hour

a pistol at his side and unconscious from
a wound in the head, having shot himself
in the mouth, the ball coming out near
the right temple. Temporary mental dn
rangfement, caused by sickness and finan

man's Call.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
INDIANAPOLIS, Jan. 26.â 1t was not
expected that the monetary convention
would remain In session more than two
days, and this expectation was realized.
It settled down to work promptly at 10
o'clock this morning, and adjourned at
2 o'clock, subject to the call of Chair
man Hugh Hanna. The business of the
convention was to indorse the report of
the Monetary Commission, which is
now before Congress in the form of a
bill, and when this was done it prompt
ly adjourned.
E. J. Parker of Illinois presented a
resolution approving the efforts of the
National Business League to forward a
movement toward the establishment of
a National Department of Commerce
and Industries, the head of which shall
be a member of the Cabinet. Charles
S. Fairchild, ex-Secretary of the Treas
ury, delivered a speech. He said:
"Men in the past have had stand
ards of value and mediums of exchartge
or circulating mediums, or whatever
name you may give them, with no laws
save the customs of business; these
they can have in the future without
statutes, if statutes stand in the way
of the irresistible force of the concur
ring habits of men.
"Whatever DC the standard named by
law, men will continue to measure
value by gold until, by the concurrence
of their habits, they evolve something
that suits their purpose better."
The n-xt speaker was Congressman
Jesse Overstie. t of the Indianapolis
district, who introduced the monetary
bill into Congress. He thought the bill
would receive the thorough attention of
Congress and saM Speaker Reed would
in no way retard its careful considera
tion.
"If we are defeated." said he, "we
shall not be conquered."
C. C. Homer of Baltimore urged the
importance of organization and said
that Congress should understand that
this plan was the will of the people.
Mr. "Wbcelock of Minnesota, chairman
of the Committee on Resolutions, asked
John N. Bullitt of Philadelphia to read
the resolutions. These recognize the
convention's obligations to the Execu
tive Committee and cordially approve
the plan of currency reform submitted
by the eommisnion.
The resolutions were discussed in
five-minute speeches, and at 2:30, after
two hours of favorable debate, were
unanimously adopted.

EASTERN WAITRESSES
COMING TO CALIFORNIA.
New York Restaurant-Keepers Complain of
the Exodus to the Pacific
Coast
NEW YORK. Jan. 26.â The exodus of
girls from this city to the Pacific Coast
and other Western points to secure posi
tions as waitresses has been felt here,
and the stories of high wages, easy
hours, beautiful climates and cheaper
living expenses have set girls in this city
to thinking. Many of the uptown em
ployment agencies are now filling west
ern orders, to the great discomfort of lo
cal restaurant keepers.
"There la likely to be serious trouble
for us." said the manager of a large
downtown restaurant to-day, "if this sort
of thing keeps up. Why. it is almost im
possible to keep goodiooking girls here
since the California craze has set in. A
number of them left two of our establish
ments to take positions in a hotel at San
Diego, and only to-day I learned that
four more had secured positions in Los
Angeles. One agent advertised hero about
ten days for two girls with experience
ds waitresses. One of our girls accepted i
and no sooner had the report of her trip
to the coast become known than four
more followed her examnlo. Our cus- '
â¢tomers. too. are in th<* habit of being
served by some one waitress and con- ,
stant changes of help means a severe loss j
of patronage. I cannot see why Califor- !
nla cannot turn out satisfactory girls, 'â¢
and why they should have to come east :
for their supply, but I am told that the |
demand is for eastern girls exclusively."

the Gasconade County Jail at Herman.
Mo. They became warm friends. Inter
changes of confidences followed and of
these Willard was profuse. They were of
a domestic nature generally, and particu

have served his term for beating a neigh

leased ten days ago. Willard "became a
free man Monday. His release came in
the form of a pardon oased on informa- :

friend's treachery. In brief, Conway had
visited thf> Willard home directly aft-r
he was released and had found Mrs. Wil

He prevailed upon her to go with him.

TWO GEORGIA MEN IN
A FIVE HOURS' DUEL
Protected by Trees. They Battle With Fire-
arms Until Both Are Seriously
Wounded.
SENOIA, Ga.. Jan. 26.â J. T. Entrikln
.and Clinton Morgan , white men. fought
for five hours near h<-rv w-st-rday after
noon. Both hid behind tree*, Morgan
using a shotgun and Entrikin a revolver.
For some time there had been had blood
betwetn the two men and Entrikin, who
if a bailiff, wont to serve papers on Mor
gan. The latter caught him in the road
and opened fire on him. After a flve
hours' conflict, in which both men wen
seriously wounded, a friend of Morgan
came along and extricated him, and En
trikin was compelled to return to town
without hi* prisoner.
Outside of the lepal phase of the ques

trouble is predicted when they are In
condition to renew hostilities. Entrikin
says that had it not been for two large
trees, of which they took advantage, both
he and Morgan would have been shot to
death.
PRAISE FOR THE CALL.
People of Suisun Pleased With the Go/den
Jubilee Edition.
SI'TSUV. Jan. 26.â The great stroke of
The Call's enterprise in the distribution
of the Golden Jubilee edition was the
principal subject of discussion here last
Sunday morning. At an early hour the
interesting edition, with its valuable and
appropriate data was In eager demand,
and The Call was complimented on Its
feat, which is regarded as a grand scoop
over its contemporaries. Public opinion
was unanimous in its praise of the Jubilee
edition, and there was a lively demand
for copies.
To the pioneers the edition was es
pecially welcome, containing as it did a
collection of facts and incidents which
carried them back to the "years of gold."
The Jubilee edition, following so closely
upon the unequaled Christinas number
of The Call, is evidence that the journal
which "speaks for all" has set a puce

GATHERING OF
STOCK GROWERS
Topics of the Range Dis-
cussed at Denver's
Convention.
Governor Richards Advocates
State Control of All
Public Lands.
Steps Taken to Apprehend Rustlers
in Utah, Wyoming and
Colorado.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
DENVER, Jan. 26.â Chairman Spring
er called the National Stock Growers'
, Convention to order at 10 o'clock this
morning. There was a fair attendance
of delegates. A committee was appoint
i ed, composed of one delegate from each
State represented, to draft a consti
tution and by-laws.
The first address was on "Statistics
as to Values of Livestock and Prospect
ive Conditions," by J. H. Neff, editor
I of the Drovers' Telegram, Kansas City.
i The speaker reviewed the history of the
stock growers' business for the past fif
teen years, showing that the industry,
which was on the down grade for a
number of years, reached bottom a cou
ple of years ago and has since been
improving.
Governor W. A. Richards of Wyom- j
ing next spoke on "The Cession of the
Arid Public Lands to the States." Gov- â 
ernor Richards took the position that
not only the arid lands, but all the
public lands, should be given to the
States. They would then, he claimed,
soon be made to help pay the Govern-,
ment expenses and sooner be put in the
hands of actual settlers. Governor
Richards said the money received from
the sale of public lands had been very !
largely used in States other than those j
in which the lands were situated, to
the advantage of the older and at the â¢
expense of the younger States.-
El wood Mead, State Engineer of Wy- â 
oming, spoke on "How Best to Prevent ;
Clashing Between Sheep and Cattle I
Men on the Ranges." He favored the j
leasing of all public lands and the !
breaking up of ranges as a means of
preventing constant warfare between
cattlemen and sheepmen.
The afternoon session opened with a
series of papers on "Contagious Dis- j
eases Affecting Values of Livestock."
Dr. Charles Cresswell, State Veterin- j
arian of Colorado, read the first paper,
treating of "The Best Methods of Pre
vention." He took the position that
the Government should maintain
proper quarantines and make experi
ments in methods of preventing and ;
subduing diseases, but he said a gen- j
eral knowledge of sanitary laws and
needs was necessary in the stock raiser
himself. He severely condemned
patent medicines as a general rule.
Dr. A. T. Peters of the University of
Nebraska spoke on "Advancement in
Controlling Diseases." He treated
largely of the various methods of vac
cination which he held to be the most
effective method of fighting disease in
livestock.
"W. S. Seavey of Utah offered a reso
lution calling upon the . Governors of
Utah,. Wyoming and Colorado to ap
point a joint committee to investigate
the alleged wholesale and repeated
cattle and sheep stealing by organized
robbers in the section of country, in
cluding Northeastern Utah, South
western Wyoming and Northwestern
Colorado.
F. J. Berry of the Union Stockyards,
Chicago, spoke on "The Up-to-Date
Horse and the Export Demand." He
asserted that electricity and the
bicycle had destroyed the demand for
small horses, but the demand for
large, first quality animals is better
than ever, and such horses bring good
prices at all times.
The committee on constitution and
by laws made its report, and after
amendments had been made it was j
adopted. "The National Livestock i
Association of the United States of j
America" was the name chosen. The
representation at the annual conven
i tion is to include State delegates at
large and representatives from stock
associations, commercial exchanges,
chambers of commerce and irrigation
associations^

He has also taken cognizance of the
syndicated press, and has remarked on
the fact that in many instances the
people were led on to ruin by newspa
pers and public Journals controlled and
run In the interests of monopoly. When
Rev. Bliss thus commented he must
certainly have had In mind the Times,
Herafd and Express, and the Los Ange
les water fight.
The special committee which has
been appointed by the City Council to
look into the matter of a source of
mountain water supply has started to
work in earnest upon the difficult task,
which has been entrusted to Council
men Grider, Hutchison and Matthus.
The effort will now be made by the
syndicated water company press to dis
credit the report before it is even made
ot a hint given out as to what it is or
what it will be. This policy is clearly
outlined by the Express, which is
owned body and soul by the water
company. The intention is to claim
that the three Councilmen who have
been named are interested in some
scheme or to discredit them in some
way.

HIS LEG AMPUTATED.
Theodor Meetz, tbe Capitalist,
Suffering From Blood
Poisoning.
ALAMEDA, Jan. 26.â Theodor Meetz,
the well-known Alameda capitalist and
streetcar man, is lying at his home, 735
Railroad avenue, suffering from the am
putation of his right leg, as the result of
blood-j)oisoning. The operation took place
this morning, and was successfully per
formed by an Oakland physician.
Mr. Meetz has long suffered from a crip
pled foot, caused by being crushed while
he was driving one of his own streetcars
years ago. A bunion made Its appearance
on the big toe of this foot some time
since, and it finally became so painful
that about throe weeks ago the services
of a chiropodist were called in, and the
excrescence was removed. Blood-poison
ing, however, set in, and the leg became
bo painful and swelled to such a size that
it finally became necessary to amputate it
in order to save t-\T Meetz's life.
The patient, however, is some 77 years
of age, and it is considered very doubtful
whether he will fully recover. He is one
of the oldest residents of this city, and
has accumulated much property. For
years he was the owner of the only
streetcar line between this city and Oak
land, and realized large profits from it.
Besides his property in Alameda, ho
also owns land in Kern County and else
where in the interior. He has no family,
except his wife.

TACOMA, Wash.. Jan. 26.â The crew
of the British bark Marlon Fraser.
which left Tacoma last week with
wheat for Europe, engaged in a terrific
free fight aboard the vessel while in
the straits Sunday. On Monday night
John P. Somburg and Victor Fred
berg, two of the crew, attempted to es
cape from the bark while she was lying
at shelter in Port Angeles. Fredberg
made shore, but his companion was
drowned. They used a raft made of
small timber. There was a heavy sea,
and the raft struck a wharf, broke up
and Somburg went under. Fredberg
got ashore after a hard experience. No
Inquest was considered necessary.
Somburg was buried at Port Angeles
to-day by citizens.
Seven sailors of the Fraser left her
here and libeled h^r for their wages.
declaring they had been treated cruelly
and given insufficient food. British
Consul Alexander investigated their
charges and pronounced them ground
less. He had the men arrested for de
serting and locked up by United States
Marshal Ide until the ship sailed, when
they were taken aboard in irons. En
to the ship three of them pulled
; â  of iron from their- pockets and
I three large plate glass windows.
On i;oing aboard they refused to work
and were put in confinement.
Before Flattery was reached
th<> rebellious sailors had got out of
b..th irons and the ship's hospital, in
which they were locked up. Then fol
lowed a fight such as has not been
s^ :i aboard a ship on Puget Sound in
years. Captain McDonald, who was
the special object of their hatred, was
severely kicked In the stomach and
knocked senseless. His body and limbs
are black and blue from numerous
blows. Hard knocks were dealt on
b..th sides, but in the end the sailors
capitulated.
An account of the fight, written by
Captain McDonald and sent back by
his tug, reached her to-day. He says:
"We locked the men in the ship's hos
pital, but while In the straits they
worked the swivels in their irons until
they broke and soon all were loose.
They were given food through the
ports, and I Intended to let them out
this morning, but while we were at
breakfast some one knocked away the
barricade of the door and my birds
were walking the deck In about a
Becond.
"I called them aft and asked if they
were willing to turn to, but each re
fused. So I called the remainder of
th<* crew and said that if they refused
duty I would put Into Royal Roads
and land all of them for mutiny at sea.
"I then gave orders to the mate and
th a peaceable members of the crew to
handcuff the seven who would not
turn to. They fought like devils. It
took fifteen minutes to down the seven.
1 was badly kicked in the stomach. My
logs are black and blue from kicks,
and the faithful men of the crew are
bumped and bruised from head to foot.
"I then gave orders to the mate to
iron them. In a short time they sud
denly gave in and promised to work.
After warning them not to touch one
another in the forecastle and telling
them that the first man to start a row
would be put in irons again I un
shackled them and gave them their
clothes. They then quietly turned to."

INSECT MONSTROSITIES
PRODUCED BY GRAFTING.
Novel Experiments Conducted at the New
Jersey State Experiment
Station.
NEW YORK. .Tan. 26.â The New Jersey
State experiment station at New Bruns
wick has been grafiiriK Insects and pro
ducing monstrosities by grafting half of
one insect upon half of another. The
experiments were the subject of a paper
read by Professor Smith befofe the New
J. rsey Microscopical Society in New
Brunswick.
'All thai is necessary to do," said Pro
teseor Smith. "Is to Ret any number of
pupae of moths, put them on ice, cut off
their beads or their tall, solder them to
together with paraflne wax and let them
grow.' 1
Dr. Smith showed how Professor
Crampton of Ithica, N. V., had soldered
the head of one moth to the tall of a
second; how he had united bends to
heads, abdomens to dbdomens, backs to
backs ami breasts to breasts. A fair per
of the Insects live.
â¢The fact is important," said Dr. Smith,
"that we can graft at all and be assured
that experiments in this line will not
cease. They may be tried soon upon
animals higher in the scale."

THE SAX FKAXCISCO CALL, THTJKSDAT, JAXFARY 27, 1898.
The above fac-simile Is of the original poster put up by the Vigilance Committee of the town of Randsburg on
December 7. 1596. warning lawless characters to leave the camp. It accomplished the purpose which it was intended
to serve, and is one of the relics of the camp no money could purchase, although many offers have been
made for it. The original, sent to The Call by express, and received last night, will, at the request of the ex
chairman of the Vigilantes, be presented to the Park Museum.
On January 18, 1897. there was a heavy fall of snow at Randsburg, and in the battle of snow-balls that followed,
the old poster, still on its wall, was made the target for many a missile. This accounts for Its dilapidated appear

JIMS LOCKED
IN A COLD ROOM
Given the Alternative
of Agreeing or

Reach a Verdict When Almost
Dead and Suffering
Greatly.
Steam Was Turned Off as Soon Â»s
They Had Retired to
Deliberate.
Special DlÃi<atch to The Call.
BOSTON. Jan. 26.â 1f the story upon
which is based the charge of corrup
tion of the Jury which heard the case
of Bucksport vs. Bluehill in the Han
cock County Supreme Court is true,
that jury has passed through an exper
ience probably never before undergone
under similar circumstances by any
twelve Maine jurymen. That twelve
men should have been kept locked up
in a cold room through such a severe
night as was that of last Saturday,
' without lights, and then told that if
they did not agree they would have to
stay ther-Â» tw?nty-four hours longer,
seems Incredible, yet that is the story
which has occasioned a motion that the
verdict be set aside, and which the
court will investigate.
The action was brought to determine
a pauper settlement. The case was an
old one, and had been in the courts be
fore. There was a great deal of inter
est in it all over the county from the
fact that at one time or another mem
bers of this particular family had lived
in and received aid from a great many
different towns. So closely were the
lines drÃwn that it was difficult to get
a jury to try the case, and a special ve
nire had to be issued in order to fill the
panel.
The case went to the jury on Satur
day afternoon about 6 o'clock. Then
the steam was turned off. and the room
allowed to become so cold that the
Jurors put on their overcoats, but could
even then barely keep from freezing, as
a terrible blizzard was blowing. Then
the lights were put out.
Some time Sunday morning the of
ficer in charge of the Jury entered the
room and Informed the members that
unless they should agree upon a ver
dict before midnight they would be kept
where they were until 9 o'clock Monday
mominp. At 9 o'clock Sunday morn-
Ing a. sealed verdict was rendered.

It. What can I do?"

Some Experiments That May Make the

Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Wash.. Jan. 26.â Russia
greatly desires to find means of com
munication between her north coast
and Siberia by crossing the Arctic Sea.
To this end she will make some exper
iments next summer. According- to ad
vices received tn-day by steamer Brae
mer. Admiral Makaroff, of the Russian
navy, has announced his belief that it
is possible to travel to Siberia by water
across the Arctic Sea. The Admiral
has lately returned to St. Petersburg
from a Journey along the extreme
northern coast, where he made extend
ed investigations and observations re
garding currents, seasons and the
breaking up of Ice in summer. His
report states that the chief obstacles
to the establishment of a maritime
route to the Obi and Yenisei rivers are
the Ice floes from the Kara Sea, located
between the island of Nova Zembla
and the Obi Peninsula. It Is found that
as a rule this sea is free from ice dur
ing August, though It occasionally hap
pens that Ice lasts throughout the sum
mer.
Admiral Makaroff believes that regu
lar communication with the north flow
ing Siberian rivers can be established
through July and August by providing
vessels bound for those ports with an
escort of boats furnished with â¢ ice
plows.
The government Is planning to test
his project, being greatly encouraged
by the success of the Danish Ice break
ers in keeping Vladivostock harbor
open this winter.
The Obi and Yenisei penetrate the
central portion of Russia's possessions,
their tributaries extending to the boun
daries of Turkestan and the Chinese
Empire. These rivers drain immense
fertile plains, which Russia is desirous
of having more completely settled.
Lack of transportation is the principal
drawback and this will be largely
overcome if Admiral Makaroff 1 s plan is
feasible. Materials for the trans-Si
berian railroad can also be handled
more cheaply that way.

LOS ANGELES, Jan. 26.â At a meeting

State and Treasurer. It is expected that
the matter will be taken up immediately

SIGNIFICANT MOVEMENT
OF BRITISH WAR VESSELS.
Hurrying Southward From Esquimau to
the Chilean Coast â Serious
Trouble fs Anticipated.
SAN DIEGO, Jan. 26.â The information
roparrHnK the trip south of tho British
Cruiser Phonsant. now here, is rather
startling if true, and it seems well
authenticated. While the officers of the
Pheasant would convey the Impression
thai their trip down the coast is merely
a cruise, it is learned indirectly from one
of the subordinates that their ship is
being hurried to reach the southern
â waters, where she is tv> Join the big
cruiser Amphion, and the two will go
south to Iquique. The I.eander and tor-
P< Mo-destroyer Sparrowhawk are also un
derstood to be on thHr way south, and
were to have left Esquimau yesterday.
It is impossible to learn what trouble
the British are expecting off the coast of
Chile, but it must be considered serious
for the I,eander and Sparrowhawk to be
ordered from Esquimau so soon after
their long voyage from England.

WELCOME
Hawaiia's Chief Ar
rives at the Na
tion's Capital.
Greeted at the Depot by
the Secretary of
State.
Conveyed in President McKln
ley's Carriage to His
Quarters.
SHOWN EVERY COURTESY.
The American Executive Sends Con
gratulations and Notice of
a Visit.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington. Jan. 26.
President Dole of Hawaii arrived
here at 2:10 p. m., and. in behalf of the
Government, was welcomed by Secre
tary Sherman and Assistant Secretary
Adee. The Presidential party was be
lated by storms along the way. and it
was three hours after the schedule
time that the train swung into the Bal
timore and Ohio depot. A crowd of
several hundred had assembled on
North Capitol street, and three platoons
of mounted police were on hand to act
as an escort.
As the train came to a stop Mr. Sher
man and Mr. Adee stepped on the rear
platform, and were met by Assistant
Secretary Cridler, who conducted them
inside for the first greetings to Presi
dent and Mrs. Dole and the party.
There was a brief and informal ex
change of compliments, and then the
party filed out to the waiting carriages.
As they alighted Secretary Sherman
and President Dole, with Mrs. Dole
standing between them, were photo
graphed. Then Secretary Sherman of
fered his arm to Mrs. Dole and escort
ed her to President McKinley's car
riage.
The platoons of officers wheeled
about, the spirited bays of the White
House stepped off at a lively gait, and
the party proceeded to the Arlington,
where the Hawaiian executive will be
the nation's guest. In the second car
riage were Minister Hatch of Hawaii,
Assistant Secretary Cridler and Mr.
Dole's private secretary.
Following this was the carriage of
Assistant Secretary Adee and Dr. Day,
the physician of Mr. Dole. The fourth
cairiage contained Major Heislandt,
representing the army, and Lieutenant-
Commander Phelps of the navy. There
was no military display, simplicity
being the order at Mr. Dole's request.
The Arlington was reached about
2:30. Secretary Sherman, with Mr-.
Dole on his arm, escorted the party to
their rooms and then took his official
leave. Mr. Porter, private secretary to
the President, accompanied by Colonel
Bingham, was notified by telephone of
the arrival and sorn appeared, bearing
the congratulations of President Mc-
Kinley and requesting to be informed
when it would be most convenient fur
the President of the Hawaiian republic
to receive him in person. It was ar
ranged that, soon after the arrival of
their baggage. President Dole would
notify President McKinley of his
readiness to receive him.
The apartments to which the dis
tinguished guests were assigned are on
the second floor, facing Vermont ave
nue and I street. The drawing room is
in the corner, and next on the Vermont
side are the bedrooms of President and
Mrs. Dole. The private dining room
adjoins the drawing room on the I
street front. The furnishings of the
apartments are rich, but apparently
there had been no effort at display.
Thp decorations consisted almost en
tirely of American Beauty roses, which
had been tastefully arranged on tho
mantles and tables.
UNION PACIFIC TRAINS
TO MAKE FAST TIME.
Improved Passenger Service to Go Into
Effect on the Sixth of
February.
OMAHA. Jan. 26â On February 6 there
â will be a complete reorganization and im
provement of the passenger train service
of the reorpanized Union Pacific Railroad.
Two handsomely appointed trains to run
between Chicago and Denver via the
Northwestern and the Union Pacific Rail
roads will be placed in service, and the
runningtime of all theexpress trainswill
be considerably shortened, recent experi
ments having proved that the Union .ra
ciflc can run its heaviest trains at as high
a rate of speed as is found on i_ny rail
road in the United States. Two" new
trains between Chicago and Denver will
be scheduled between forty-five and flftv
miles an hour, and this will necessitate
their being run at the rate of nftv-ilve to
sixty miles an hour.
The Colorado special will reach Chicago
at noon, reach Omaha at midnight and
Denver the next morning. The San Fran
cisco through service will bo shortened
six hours, the train leaving Chicago late
nights to connect with the New York
Central through train, thus cutting the
time from New York to San Francisco
twelve hours. This means a rearrange
ment of all Western schedules on the
roads.
A SAN RAFAEL MAN'S
HOME IS FORTIFIED.
Patrick Rice Fires a Shot at a Woman, and
Afterward Secures His Freedom on
$100 Bonds.
SAX RAFAEL, Jan. 2Câ Patrick Rice,
an old resident, lias turned his home into
a fortification, and, like old General
Clay's home in Kentucky, there are arms
stacked In the hallways ready for ap
proaching trouble. Rice very recently
pot into trouble by taking a shot at Mrs
William Brown, the wife of a San Fran
cisco mechanic. Brown swore out a war
rant before a local Justice for Rice's ar
rest for disturbing the peace, not desir
ing to arrest the man for a graver of
fense. Rice secured his liberty in $100
bonds, and is now at home ready with
gun and pistol to stand off any one who
approaches.
It seems that Mrs. Brown got into an
argument, and Rice got so excited that
he fired at her. Officer O'Brien went to
place Rice under arrest and found him
locked in his room, threatening to kill
the officer if he made an attempt to get
in and place him under arrest. Finally
however, Itice came out and secured
bonds.
PIGMIES OF.
THE UPPER
AMAZON
Discovery Made by a
Traveler From
Boston.
Strange Race Which Is
Evidently of Indian
Descent.
Ugly in Shape and Too Lazy
to Do More Than Hunt
and Gorge.
THE MEN ARE WARRIORS.
To the Number of Ten or Fifteen
Thousand They Rove the
Rio Negro Country.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON, Jan. 26.â A Boston man
just returned from South America has
brought a marvelous tale of the discov
ery of a race of pigmies inhabiting the
valley of the Amazon. He has not only
seen them, but stayed in their villages,
entered their houses, pat about their
camp fires, been with them on the hunt
and witnessed some of their religious
ceremonies.
Ebon J. Sullivan, for months accom
panied only by natives, rowed up the
mighty Amazon and the tributaries in
a dugout canoe. In this way he pene
trated to the headwaters of the Rio Ne
ero, where he came upon a nomadic
race of pigmies.
K. G. Haliburton of Boston, fellow
of the Royal Geographical Society, one
of the best authorities in the world on
pigmy races, thinks it of the greatest
value to anthropologists to have the
tradition of pigmy races in South
America, recorded by Humboldt in the
first years of this century, so strikingly
verified. In Mr. Haliburton's opinion.
Sullivan's observations clear the sub
ject and leave no doubt as to the exist
ence of numerous pigmy tribes in Gui
ana and Venezuela. Mr. Sullivan said
to-day:
"I met while on the Rio NegTo, one of
the tributaries of the Upper Amazon,
a race of remarkably small people, who
were more likely of an Indian than of a
negro origin, judging from their hair
and the peculiar color of the skin,
which was a brilliant livid reddish yel
low.
"They are very ugly in shape; their
stomach, which js distended in the back
as well as front, is big and out of all
proportion to their tiny, spindling "arms
and legs. I think this is caused by their
anaconda-like practice of gorging.
After a hunt they will eat like animals,
and then lie about listlessly in the hot
tropical sun for days till hunger again
Impels thfm to get more game.
"Curiously enough, they appear to be
metal-workers and tip their darts with
bits of hardened iron or steel made
from native ores. These darts are pro
jected from a blowgun, like a boy's
toy, but with deadly effect. They can
actually propel a light dart several
hundred feet by the mere power of
their lungs in blowing through a tube.
They are a race of roving hunters and
warriors. They are a vain and boast
ful people. I think that they may num
ber ten to fifteen thousand souls.
"These people are not over four feet
eight inches in height and the women
are less than this. Clothing Is worn
only by adults and consists of merely a
cloth over the krins. Their hair is done
up and Ftuck together by mud in a
most grotesque and repulsive fashion.
They have tribal marks that cover the
upper body and head, made by slits
in the skin.
"Their huts are sometimes construct
ed of mud. in which case they are low
and resemble a half egg with an open
ing at one end called massongos. The
same name applies to their huts when
made from poles and woven grass.
They have many fetish gods or idols
which represent animals and are very
ugly. As to the name of these pigmy
people, they were, as I remember them,
Makalak, Malaka and Malakrat."
SANTA CRUZ CONSTABLE
ON TRIAL FOR MAYHEM.
Arraignment of Joseph Harveston, Accused
of Being an Accomplice of George
F. Plyier.
SANTA CRUZ. Jan. 20. â The trial of
Constable Joseph Harveston. charged
with mayhem, began in the Superior Court
to-day. Harveston is wtll known
throughout the county and has served
several terms as constable. He is ac
cused of having been an accomplice of
George F. Plyier in maiming Charles
Harris. The courtroom was crowded and
a Jury was secured this afternoon.
Diptrlrt Attorney I,lndsay told the story
of thf crime and Harris testified to see
ing three men in the room, but could only
identify Plyier. He 6ald Harveston had
handed him a note from Mrs. Plyier.
Mrs. Plyier. who was next called, testi
fied that her husband was the only per
son she recognized; that she was too
busy trying to got out of the room to
bother about seeing who the other men
were. She said that Harveston had called
twice at the room while Harris was pres
ent to see her about a telephone mes
sage from San Jose. She was next cross
examined and after her testimony she
retired to an ante-room and shed bitter
tears of remorse and became hysterical
William Bishop testified to Plyier tele
phoning for Harveston.
J. P. Majors testified that the defend
ant had said he had been paid to watch
the house in which were Harris and Mrs
Plyier.
Sensational testimony is expected to be
introduced by the prosecution to-morrow.

LITIGATION TO
BE DISMISSED
Compromise of a Noted
Los Angeles Will
Contest.
Agreement Finally Reached as
to the Late Bridget Wil
son's Estate.
Administrator Will Settle Through
His Bondsmen and Relinquish
All Claims.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES. Jan. 26.â 1t seems
that the litigation over the estate of
the late Bridget Wilson is about to
come to a close. The inevitable dis
pute over the validity of the will was
fought all the way to the Supreme
Court, but after that was settled a
long litigation was threatened between
the heirs of the estate and the special
administrator. John P. Moran.
When Bridget Wilson died leaving a
large amount of valuable real estat<>
in this city and cutting off her hus
band. John Wilson, with practically
nothing, a will contest resulted.
Judge Clark gave a decision for the
contestant and revoked the probate of
the will. In 1805 the court appointed
M .>ran special administrator of the
estate under $38,000 bonds. An appeal
was taken to the Supreme Court and
Judge Clark was reversed. The
original administrators were rein
stated and a settlement wa. made by
Moran, the special administrator. In
this settlement it was found that he
had $9316 54 belonging to the estate.
In September. 1897, the adminis
trators of the estate made a demand
on Moran for this amount, but with
the exception of $635 34, which he paid
; before the settlement of the account,
;he refused to pay the shortage. An
: action was thereupon brought against
, him to recover the balance, $8680 80,
; which action is still pending.
In February, 1597, however, John
! Wilson died, leaving his sister, Matilda
; "Walden, as his sole heir to battle for a
share in the estate. Through her ef
; forts a compromise in the will contest
j was brought about, and it is to bo
I peaceably settled and all litigation is
i about to be dismissed. Through his
! bondsmen Moran has offered to pay
! $3065 67 and to relinquish all claims on
] the estate due him as administrator.
\ The compromise has been accepted.

Feud.

Remarkable Bill of Complaint
of Landlord Against
Tenant.
Small Compensation for a Wrecked
Cottageâ The Plaintiff Uses
His Fist.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAX RAFAEL, Jan. 26.â Superior
Judge F. M. Angellotti's courtroom
looked like a second-hand junkshop to
d;ty, fur broken dishes, cracked stoves,
wrecked crockery, smashed music
boxea and oth-r unsightly objects lit
tered the desks and the courtroom as
exhibits in one of the strangest cases
which has come before his Honor for
some time. And on the courthouse
steps at noon to-day one of the attor
neys in the case used his fist on the
face of the defendant's brother-in-law
to add to the general excitement.
It all occurred over the lease of a
little cottage in Larkspur by George
G. Gormley of San Franc^oo. Gormley
rented the place from W, H. Mahoney,
an attorney, and moved into It with
his -wife, and w_hen they left there was
hardly a piece of Mahoney's property
that was not smashed beyond recall.
The story id t..:,j in the complaint, and
a more hitter tale of woe could hardly
be conceived.
It seems that In January of last year
Mi honey and Gormley entered Into an
agreement whereby Gormley rented
Mahout ys house In Larkspur for three
months at the monthly rental of $20,
and it was expressly agreed that
Gormley did not lease the barn and
was not entitled to the possession of It.
This being the case, Mahoney caused
the barns dooTs to be bolted and the
windows nailed up securely, but Gorm
ley broke down the barriers, smashed
the locks and opened the barn. Gorm
ley used two bales of hay and a portion
of another bale, and when he left he
carried away with him the remaining
portion of the third bale. He also used
and broke v saddle in the barn belo-ng
ing to Mahoney and, in fact, completely
destroyed it.
Mahoney also laments the loss of a
double harness which Gormley broke
and threw in a filthy condition into the
attic. Even the- lock had been torn
from the d >or and lost. The defend
ant also either broke, lost or destroyed
some of the permanent fixtures in the
house, besides smashing crockery and
glassware galore. The bowls In the
washstands were broken and useless,
the ovendoor of the kitchen stove was
cracked and mutilated, and the glass
in the window of the bedroom was
smashed into ten thousand pieces. The
lamps and chimneys were among the
missing or broken, the looking-glass
was a pitiful sight, while wine and beer
glasses were total wrecks. The plates
were crack, d and chipped almost be
yond recognition, and so through a
score of articles the plaintiff sets forth
BOW his property was abused.
Both sides put in their arguments
and testimony, the plaintiff to prove
that the defendant had done all the
damage, and the defendant attempted
to show that the damage had been done
before he took the house. Some of the
rent remained unpaid and Mahoney
wanted that and damages also.
Among the witnesses were W. H.
Mahoney, Mrs. T. Gormley, George T.
Gormley, Mrs. Frances Ryan and Ber
nard Bassinl.
Late this afternoon Judge Angellotti
figured out the damage and allowed
Mahoney $44 and costs, and the event
ful case was over, and the Janitor re
moved the debris and Junk to the fur
nace.
It was at the noon hour to-day when
Mahoney landed his faithful right on
the nose of George Linderman, a broth
er of Mrs. Gormley. The affair occurred
Just outside the court room on the
tfteps of the courthouse. Mahoney was
calling the defendant, Gormley, a long
list of hard names, when Linderman
stepped between the Irate attorney and
Gormley and said that he did not in
tend to listen to Mahoney talking to
his brother-in-law in such a manner.
Linderman never said another word
Mahoney gave him a straight arm
blow that sent the young man flying
across the steps, and then the combat
ants were separated and went their
way. No warrants were sworn out,
and the Larkspur feud terminated with
Just a tiny stream of blood on Llnder
man's features.
DEATH TO THE

Than Offset by Riddance
of the Pests.

Southern California Weekly
Crop Bulletin.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FREPXO, Jan. 26.â Last night the
heaviest frost of the year, which has
been a particularly cold one, was felt
in this vicinity, but the vineyardlsts
and fruit growers, instead of taking
into account the damage done to the
trees and vines, are rejoicing, as the
heavy frost is said to have rid the
county of the thrip or the vine hopper,
which has been doing an Incalculable
injury to the vines. This morning the
vineyardists, upon examining their
orchards, found innumerable hoppers
dead in the grass, having been killed
by the frost.
A singular thing about the pest Is
that they seem to resurrect, but the
vineyardists believe they are all thor
oughly dead after last night's cold
spell. When the supposed dead h,op
pers are placed in a sack and put near
a fire they become as lively as crickets
in a short time, but the experiment was
tried this morning to see whether the
pests were dead. They showed no
signs of animation, and the vineyard
ists believe the frost was a blessing in
disguise.
Young orange and lemon trees were
badly damaged by the severe frost, be
ing stripped of every vestige of ver
dure. The unpacked oranges were also
damaged, but the loss was more than
compensated by the destruction of the
hoppers.
PETAL!' MA, Jan. 26.â This after
noon this city was visited by a fierce
wind storm, although of brief dura
tion. Shutters and gates were torn off
and buildings shook with the blasts.
LOS ANGELKS, Jan. 26.â The week
ly crop bulletin for Southern Califor
nia, prepared by Observer Franklin
for the week ending January 24, is as
follows: The weather during the past
week continued cool, dry and very
windy toward the close. Light rains
fell in some places on the 23d. being
scarcely sufficient to lay the dust. The
ground is becoming very dry, but plow
ing and seeding continues in the hope
that later precipitation will mature a
crop. Frosts occurred during the week
and in localities ice formed a skim on
water in exposed places. The high
winds did mne damage to trees and
blew fruit off. but no general results
of the wind and frost are received with
this week's report.
KKDLANDS. Jan. 26.â The orange-grow
ers of Redlandfl arc greatly worried over
prevailing weather conditions. It is gen
erally conceded that some damage must
have' been done to the fruit on the trees,
although no reliable estimate can be made
at present. For the first time in the his
tory of Redlfttids there was a resort to
smudging Monday night, which is re
ported to have assisted greatly in the
few orchards in which it was tried in
raising the temperature.

Two Citizens of Los Angeles Charged With
Murder Are Dismissed, but Are
Immediately Rearrested.
LOS ANGELES. Jan. 26.â George "W.
Cardwell and T. H. Harris, charged with
the murder of John Hilton on Saturday
night in the Las Virgines district, were
examined to-day before Justice Richard
son of Calabasas and discharged. They
were Immediately rearrested, however,
upon a complaint issued by Assistant
District Attorney Williams, who made no
effort to prosecute them before Justice
Richardson, being satisfied of the out
come. They will t>e examined to-morrow
before Justice Young, in this city.
Cardwell and Harris were neighbors of
Hilton's, and the tragedy was the result
of an attempt on their part to use a road
running through Hilton's ranch that had
been fenced in by him.
Justice Richardson was arrested re
cently for an act similar to that which
resulted in the murder of Hilton.

Half- Breed Indian Gets
His Death "Wound in
Chinatown.
The Victim Makes No Outcry,
and Is Found Dying on
the Street.
Stabbed in the Neck by Another Red
Man, Whom the Officers
Are Trailing.
Special Dispatch to The CÂ»IL
ANGELS CAMP, Jan. 26.â Last night
â  about 9 o'clock a half-breed Indian
' named Elmer Reed was found on the
: streets in Chinatown in a dying condi
â  tlon. The person who found him made
his ghastly discovery known at once,
and in a very short time there were
! fully 300 men on the scene. The Indian
lived only a few moments after being
found. Nobody knew how the dead man
: received his wound, nor who inflicted it.
An examination of the premises by
the Coroner and the Jury sworn In to
investigate the matter revealed the fact
that the Indian received his fatal
I wound in a Chinese house on the south
i side of the street leading to the cala
boose. The first trace of blood was dis
' covered in front of the door, and from
there a red line marked the sidewalk
j for a distance of over 100 feet, leading
! toward Main street, with here and
j there a pool of blood in the street. The
imprint of his bloody fingers was foiled
i on an awning post in front of the Chi
; nese store, and a pile of lumber in front
'of an adjoining building was covered
with blood.
The trail of gore was followed to a
new building recently erected. Here it
was that the wounded man crossed the
street and fell down and died. He was
evidently making his way to Main
street, but his life blood poured out too
freely, and it is believed he became too
weak and reeled and fell where found.
During his movements on the street he
made no outcry and nobody save the
party who cut him knew of what had
transpired till the body was found.
After the remains were viewed hy the
Coroner's jury, the body was removed
to the Morgue, where a further exam
ination of the body was made. It was
found that there was a small knife
wound in the neck, and it was evident
ly produced with a short-bladed pocket
knife, the wound not being more than
an inch and a half In depth. The caro
tid artery was severed, producing
death.
At the Inquest held to-day an Indian
held as a witness made a full state
ment of the killing, saying that an In
dian suspected of the murder was the
guilty party. The officers have gone to
his rendezvous to make the arrest, and
he will probably be in the toils of the
law soon.
SERIOUS CUTTING AFFRAY.
Discharged Employe Severely Wounded at
the Beck Ranch. Near Watsonville.
SANTA CRUZ, Jan. 28.â A very
serious cutting scrape occurred Monday
night at 10 o'clock at the Beck ranch,
near Watsonville. when Lee Reed was
very severely wounded by Robert Black,
foreman of Beck's drier. Reed had been
discharged by Black a few days before,
and on that night he came to" the drier
and a quarrel took place. During the
row Black got hold of two knives and
slashed Reed in a horrible manner about
the neck. Seventeen stitches were tak
en in the wound. The cut was of great
depth and the jugular vein was just
missed. He also received two awful
stabs, one in the shoulder and one near
his left temple. The doctor says that
Reed miraculously escaped being killed.
The examination of Black was held this
afternoon in Watsonville.

JAPAN MAY YET PUNISH
THE SLAYERS OF EPPS.
Compelled to Move by the Pressure Brought
to Bear by This Govern
ment.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 26.â The corre
spondence bearing upon the murder on
December 15 last of Frank Epps, an ap
prentice on the flagship Olympia, then
lying in the harbor of Nagasaki, Japan,
was to-day supplied to the Senate by the
Secretary of State. It shows that Ad
miral McNnir laid especial stress upon
the fact that the killing of Epps consti
tuted the- second murder of American
seamen by Japanese within three months,
that of the sailor Montgomery being the
first, and that he strongly urged investi
gation and punishment. This position was
sustained by the State Department in
pressure upon the Japanese authorities.
It appears that two Japanese were ar
rested and tried and on preliminary ex
amination were fined 150 yen each. Ad
miral MeNair, in a letter dated December
27. expresses doubt as to whether the
riali al culprits were apprehended, but he
says that the strong pressure brought to
bear upon the Japanese authorities "has
compelled at least an apparent display of
energy in seeking the murderers of Epps,
which is in contrast with the listless
course of action pursued in the case of
Montgomery."
It also appears that Epps' mother has
filed a claim for damages, and Secretary
Sherman says this will be properly prose
cuted.

Contentions.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggrs House,
Washington, Jan. 26.
For more than six hours the Senate
had under discussion the Teller resolu
tion providing that the Government pay
the principal and interest of the bonds
of the United States in silver. By agree
ment the resolution and pending
amendments are to be voted on before
adjournment to-morrow. The debate
was devoid of the sensational incidents
and acrimonious colloquies which char
acterized that of yesterday, but it was
replete with arguments and oratory.
The time was consumed by Teller (SiL
R.) of Colorado and Daniel (D.) of Vir
ginia, who supported the resolution,
and Hoar (R.) of Massachusetts and
Platt (R.) of Connecticut in opposition
to it. All delivered set speeches ex
cept Hoar, whose speech was in reply
to some points advanced by Teller yes
terday.
At the opening of the Senate Hale of
Maine presented the report of the con
ferees on the urgent deficiency appro
priatlon bill, and the report was agreed ,
to
('handler of New Hampshire secured
the adoption of a resolution calling upon
Lttorney-GeneraJ for a report as to:
whether there bav< been recent viola
tions of the constitution in Louisiana by ]
the exclusion from service on juries in
the United States courts of duly quali
fied citizens on account of color.
Upon motion of Vest of Missouri the
c then took up the Teller resolution.
The debate was opened bj Tel
Colorado, the author of the resolution, i
who began by stating that he would per- j
mit no man to excel him in honor or food
faith.
"I wou.'d do nothing," he said, "that
would bring about such a condition of
affairs ns would be disgraceful, what
ever the opinion of the Benator from
Massachusetts (Hoar) may be of my
opinions or convictions. The Massachu
setts Senator tried to make it appear
that my position was on a parallel with
the making of a $10 piece out of a cop- '
per cent. Such a proposition I do not
advance and 1 do not think it would find
much support in this or any other legis
lative body."
Teller sHid he was willing to retire
from public life If by so doing he could
bring about an international bimetallic
agreement. He maintained that the ex
isting contract concerning the money in
which bonds of the United States were
payable could not be changed without
action of Congressâ one of tne parties to
the contract â and that the Government
had a ripiit to all the advantages the
contract afforded it-
Fairbanks asked Teller whether the
present Secretary of the Treasury was
â¢ aying out only gold in liquidation
of the bonded obligations of the Govern
ment.
"I do not know," replied Teller, "what
thf Secretary of the Treasury is doing.
My relations with the present administra
tion are not such as to enable me to ob
tain information of its acts."
Being further pressed by Fairbanks
Teller said his belief was that the ad
ministration was paying the interest on
certain obligations of the Government,
r.o such obligations themselves having
matured, in gold.
"I have absolute information," retorted
Fairbanks, "that the administration is
paying the obligations I refer to in legal
tender notes. On January 1 $29,000,000 of
bonds matured, and I am informed by the
Secretary of the Treasury that these
bonds were paid, not in gold, not in sil
ver, but in legal tender notes."
"If that be so," said Teller, "we might
as well discontinue this debate and take
a vote on the pending resolution now."
The point had been reached, said Tel
ler, when an effort was being made by
the national administration to put the
country on a gold basis. There had been
too much sophistry and evasion of the
financial question among those who dis
cussed it during the past twenty years,
and, in his opinion, the time had arrived
for all parties to walk squarely up to the
cannon's mouth of the question and deal
fairly and honestly with themselves and
the people.
In response to a statement by Teller
that $202,000,000 of bonds were sold for the
purpose of maintaining the gold stan
dard Gear of Towa said it was well known
that more than $200,000,000 of those bonds
were sold to meet a deficit !n the treas
ury. The statement was flatly contra
dicted by the Colorado Senator, who
maintained that there was no necessity
for the sale of bonds to meet current ex

penses when there was plenty of silver
to meet pressing obligations of the Gov
ernment.
Referring in the course to his remarks
to the Presidential contest of IK%, Teller
said that no political campaign In this
country had ever been characterised by
bo much bitterness, acrimony and vin
dictiveness. He conceded the right, he
paid, of others to differ from him upon
this and other questions, but he h<Md
that he. ought to be accorded the same
right and liberty, for the people, nut
Â«uy of this country, but of the world,
depended upon the rightful solution of
the financial question. He had a right
to speak here for the great masses of
the people and he took advantage of it
because he felt that the fastening of the
gold standard upon the country would
simply make of the plain people hewers
of wood and drawers of water. In con
clusion, after speaking about two hours
and a half. Teller replied to some
ments made yesterday concerning sav
ings banks.
At the conclusion of Teller's speech
Lodge called attention to some state
ment* in criticism of an amendment of
fered by him (Lodge) yesterday to the
pending resolution. The amendment de
clared that the obligations of the United
B shouh! be paid "in the money
that is the highest'money of the world,
In Bold or its equivalent in gold, wheth
er ihat be silver or paper." Lodg
quired whether Teller was in favor of
that amendment.
"Well. I should vote against It." re
plied the Colorado Senator.
Lodge insisted on knowing whether
Teller did or did not think the amend
ment a proper principle for C<
lay down. Teller Btlll held that the
Government and the Government's cred
itors ought to abide by contracts i
"I desired to know," said I-od^. "what
the Senator from Colorado thought of my
amendment, because 1 copied it w<>rd for
word from a speech made t>y the Senator
in which he declared that every dollar
this Government owes will be paid In
the money that Is the highest money of
the world", in gold or its equivalent in
gold, whether that be silver or paper."
Lodge thought that if the Senator from
Colorado believed that his statement was
accurate when he made it, he ought not
now to object to supporting it with his
voice and vote.
Teller replied that he had never advo
cated the payment of Government ob
ligations In depreciated currency, and did
not now.
Hoar followed In a speech !n which he
maintained the position he took yester-
Ktliat the question under discussslon
no! one of law, but one of honor and
grity. He said that the advocafc
the pending resolution maintained that
by a crime the price of silver had been
reduced until the silver In a dollar was
. only 44 cents, yet the same Sena-
I ira who made the charge of that'Vrime"'
advocated the payment of the Govern
ment's obligation in this depre.
moneyâ money that had been depreciat
ed, as they claimed, by crime.
Hoar Bald that it had been made evi
dent by the statement of the Senator
from Arkansas (Berry), to whom he re
Â»ed as an "honest, stalwart sld Con
rate who was willling to walk up to
cannon's mouth," of the pending
question; that it was the purpose of the
silver men to go into the campaign of
1900 and declare it to be right and honest
to pay obligations in 40-cent dollars and
to stigmatize as "grabbers" and "rob
bers" those who differed from them on
the honesty of such a policy.
The Colorado Senator, when he rose to
begin his speech, Hoar said, expressed a
desire to resent something. In fact, he
was always resenting something.
Teller arose to call Hoar's attention to
another statement, and. when lie had
done so. Mr. Hoar ridiculed him by
lening him to the small boy who was
?ed what the cost of eleven pounds of
if would be at 7 cents a pound and re
ed, "You can't get no beef at no such
â¢bar was followed by Plntt of Con
ctlcut in an address in opposition to
the pending resolution.
Daniel (D.) of Virginia followed Platt
in support of the resolution. Daniel
thought the adoption of the pending reso
lution would tend to prevent nti'ls upon
the treasury. Daniel concluded at 7
o'clock. On motion of Aldrtch the Senate
went Into executive session and ten min
utes later adjourned.
POSTAL SAVINGS BANKS.
Senators Mason and Butler to Prepare a
Bill for Their Creation.
â¢WASHINGTON. Jan. 26.â The Sennte
Committtee on Postoffiees and Postroads
to-day had under consideration the ad-
visability of establishing a scheme of
postal savings banks in the United States.
The discussion was general, and the only
conclusion reached was that Senators
Mason and Butler should prepare the bill,
which could be used as a base for future
deliberations. This was done because ..f
the fact that there were a large number
of measures before the committee
looking to the Fame end. It Is intended
that the bill to be prepared by Mnson and
Butler shall supplant all these, and they
were requested to have II to no
taken up at the next meeting, to be held
a week hence.

Bitter Debate Over the
Mail-Carrier Ques
tion.
The Eastern Man Accused
of Having Spoken
Falsely.
Attempted to Justify Discrimin
ations in Favor of
New York.
SENSATIONS IN PROSPECT.
Postofflce Department Warmly As
sailed In a Speech by the
California n.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office. Riggs House,
Washington, Jan. 26.
The House devoted another day to the
consideration of the Indian appropria
tion bill, most of the time being con
sumed, ap on the two preceding days,
in discussing extraneous subjects. Ry
far the most interesting feature of th<*
day was the debate on the question of
reducing the mall carrier service in the
large cities, owing to the failure of the
Senate to attach the estimated defi
ciency of $160,000 to the urgent deficien
cy bill.
This subject has been agitating the
metropolitan cities ever since the order
was issued for cutting down the force
on February 1. A dozen Representa
tives from as many different cities pro
tested against the proposed reduction
and urged an immediate appropriation,
when Chairman Loud of the Postof
flce Committee and Chairman Cannon
of the Appropriation Committee allayed
the wrath of the members by assuring
them that there was no occasion for
alarm; that the service could not pos
sibly suffer until June, by which time
there would be ample opportunity to
pass a deficiency appropriation. Loud
used 5-triHie words in his criticism of
the Postoffloe Department officials and
promised some interesting disclosures
later.
The motion to strike out the appro
priation for the Carlisle Indian School
â  ;^feated after considerable debate
bo 65. Ten pages of the bill were
-< d of to-day. The conference re
port on the urgent deficiency bill was
adopted.
An amendment offered by Kelly (TV>
of South Dakota to increase the number
of Indian pupils at Flandreau, S. Dak.,
to 300. and to increase the appropriation
therefor 116,000, was defeatedâ ll t
The number of pupils provided for at the
Salem <or.> school was Increased by fifty.
â  tlon on this protest drew out an
indignant protest from Kelly, who paid
his respects to Shi-rman and Cannon for
looking with favor upon an amendment
offered by a member on the Republican
side- of the House. The latter replied
good-naturedly, but referred to Kelly
"bantam rooster." and usually a
"rath- r pood-looking 1 , amiable man."
The gentleman from South Dakota was
evidently nettled, and he retorted with
lerahle bitterness. So far a? physi
cal characteristics went, he said, he
thought Cannon might make as respect
a looking rooster as himself. This
wiis not the first time he had been iu
sulted by the gentleman from Illinois.
"I may Tut have had the executive ex
nce of the gentleman from Illinois,"
c. "Neither. I thank Cod. nave I
â â â¢ learned ruffianism, blackguardism
and tinirentlemaniy conduct. I grant that
he is an adept at chfcse-paring, but when
!i comes to Danville, 111., he wanted
everything in sight."
Cannon did not make any reply to this
'ilt.
Broir.well (R.) of Ohio got the floor at
this point to submit pome remarks upon
j the failure of the Benate to place in the
I urgent deficiency hill an appropriation
fur the continuation of the full mall
carrier .service until July 1. It was well
! known, he na!d, that an order had been
â¢ issued to cut down the carrier service on
I February 1. Up proceeded to comment
;on tl-e discrimination against certain
j cities, notably Cincinnati, in the matter
of carrier service.
Quigg <R) of Now York in reply maln-
I tamed that the mall deliveries in New
j York City were absolutely necessary to
i get the mat; out of and into the great of
in that city.
Williams (D.) of Mississippi made a
! humorous speech, contrasting the condl
; ticins now in his district, where the In
habitants went Fix or eight miles for
i their mails and p:iid the same postage
for the privileKe as did the inhabitant!*
of the big metropolitan cities, who had
their mail delivered free six or eight times
a day. As the Government was obliged
to economize in order to keep the ex
penditures down to the receipts he
; thought It could not be done better than
by cutting off three or four deliveries a
- day at the big trade centers.
Loud, chairman of the Postoffice Com
mittee, made a sensational speech â or,
rather, a speech promising sensational
developments in the future. He was
v.:ry boarse and It w;is with difficulty he
could be heard. Only the circumstances of
the case, he said, could induce him to
ai tempt to say anything to-day. Tha
question presented was one far
greater than the simple one of a
delivery more or less in New York
or Chicago. The statements of the gen
tleman from New York (Quigg), said he,
were absolutely false and unfounded.
That gentleman, he said, had been hav
ing himself Interviewed, charging that he
(Loud) was responsible for the existing
predicament; that he (Loud) had defied
Congress and the Postofflce and had
forced the department to cut off the car
riers.
"Such criticism," Bald Loud, "is be
neath my contempt. The charge is made
thnt the postoftice appropriation bill this
j year carried JIGO.OOO below the estimates.
I I know the officials of the Postofflce De
! partment back that charge; but I assert
i that it is false."
"Then you allege falsehood against the
officials of the department?" Interrupted
Quigg.
"Let him take It who can bear it,"
rÂ» i p raded Loud,
Loud proceeded to affirm that the Post
officials had. contrary to law
appointed 289 additional carriers and
ted a prospective deliciency of
JHiu.DOO. lie said further that, In
the face of an appropriation of
$75,000 for Incidental expenses, J107.U00
had been spent in six months. Over $50
txio of the reported deficiency, he said be
i longed in that account. He urged mem
bera not to be so < arried away by passion
ov< r tin- possible loss of a carrier or two
as to yield the last vestige of their power
of circumscribing the acts of the exec
utive branches of the Government. The
perpetuity of the legislative branch of
the Government was involved.
M<-;intimf\ he declared that the service
could not possibly suffer until June.
Tho conferenr*' report on the urgent
deficiency bill was submitted and agreed
to. At 5:32 p. m. the House adjourned.
ROUNDED THE HORN IN A CALM.
The American ship Iroquols made the run from 50 to 50 in twelve days, and rounded the cape of storms on a perfectly calm sea
and with every stitch of canvas set. The easel shown in the above cut Is made from the bones of the wings of an
albatross, which the men on the Iroquois caught off the Horn. They polished the bones and made a really beautiful
and useful ornament out of them. They presented the easel to Mrs. Taylor, the captain's wife, and she intends giving
It to her sister, Miss Alice Chittenden, the artist.
SCHOONERS ARE
IN HARD LUCK
Three of Them Had to Put
Back Owing to Stress
of Weather.
Rush of Gold-Hunters to the
Klondike, via Dyea, Still
Keeps Up.
Narrow Escape of Two of the Crew
of the Sharpshooter From
Asphyxiation.
The smartest trip of the year from
Philadelphia to Pan Francisco was
completed yesterday. The Iroquols
made the run in 128 days, and Captain
Taylor says that he would have been
in several days ago had it not been for
the heavy northwest weather off the
coast of California. From 50 in the
Atlantic to 60 In the Pacific was cov
ered In twelve days. ThÂ»: Horn was
rounded with every stitch of canvas
set, the sea was almost as smooth as
glass and the dangerous promontory
was visible from the deck of the vessel.
During the entire passage the shuttt rs
on the cabin windows were never
closed.
Paul Myrick, one of the crew, was
taken sick soon after the vessel left
Philadelphia, and Captain Taylor never
expected to land him In San Francis. <i
alive. Sailor-like, the crew grumbled
at the sick man because h>> was not
able to stand his watch and to prevent
him from being ill treated the captain
had to move him aft. Myrick was for
merly a sailor on the German ship ]!a
lena. While at work on her in Phila
delphia he fell down the hold and was
terribly injured about the head, back
and legs. He was doctored at vari
ous hospitals in the Quaker city, and
a few days after his discharge was
shipped on board the Iroquois by a
boarding-house runner, who grot a $50
advance on him as an A. 13. The sec
ond day out Myriek's legs began to
trouble him and at the end of a week
the unfortunate fellow was one mass
of running sores. He has been gradu
ally getting worse ever since, and di
rectly after the ship docked yesterday
Captain Taylor summoned the ambu
lance and sent him to the German Hos
pital.
Captain Taylor is accompanied by
his wife and two sons and the latter's
governess, Mrs. Estee, wife of the chief
officer of the ship. The two lads,
Willie and Ingram, have not only a
menagerie, but a small garden. They
have geraniums and roses in bloom
and the captain also has a box of rare
orchids which he received from the
captain of a South American trading
steamer. Willie Taylor has a little
chipmunk which is a great pet of his
and does all kinds of funny tricks.
There were two of them when the ship
left Philadelphia, but one of them died
a few weeks ago and was buried at
sea. There are also several chickens
on board the vessel and little Ingram
made pets out of them. One of them
began to set, and borrowing an egg
from his mother, Ingram placed it un
der the old hen. Much to his delight, a
couple of weeks ago a little chick was
hatched. He was heart broken, how
ever, when the chicken died and had to
follow the chipmunk overboard.
Two more schooners met with bad
luck In the northwester that is blow
ing. The Viking was 100 miles west of
Crescent City on her way to Grays
Harbor when she carried away her
foremsat and had to put back for re
pairs. A fatality caused the return of
the Amethyst. Shortly after leaving
port John Ostrom. the mate, fell from
the main boom into the sea and was
drowned. He was 35 years of age and
a native of Finland. Everything pos
sible was done to rescue the unfor
tunate man, but the sea was too heavy
to launch a boat.
The most important item of news in
the Klondike rush Is the charter of the
steamer Humboldt by John A. Magee
Jr. She will run between here and Dyea
and Skaguay, leaving on her first trip
on February 1. She will be the fastest
and best vessel on the run for many
months to come. The crew of the Hum
boldt will be furnished by the agents,
| M. Kalish & Co., and the purser will be
W. H. Triggs. The chartering of this
steamer is the biggest transaction yet
recorded, as hundreds of thousands of
dollars are involved in it.
It is said that the steamer Czarina
is to be taken off the Coos Bay trade,
fitted with berths for 100 passengers
and put on the Pyea-Skaguay run.
The steam schooners National City
and Albion have been chartered by the
Alaska-Yukon Transportation Com
pany and will at once be fitted out as
passenger steamers. The Albion will
sail from here on February 5 and the
National City five days later. The com
pany has booked its first passengers for
Dawson City, via the Yukon. Mrs.
Bjornstad and a party from Ross Val
ley will leave here about May 1 on the
steamer National City.
The steamer City of Puebla got away
yesterday with the following passen
gers for Dyea and Skaguay:
J. Ahrens. W. Stelner. D. Baltansky, M.
R. O'Connel, 11. Kahrs. Mrs. Oilman and
two children. J. C. Rico, D. 1... Gray, A.

Kate Johnson, Mrs. F. Cligrial.
Donald McLeod, a new arrival from
Australia, was also to have been a pas
senger, but he got into the hands of the
Philistines and missed his boat. Tues
day morning he had his ticket by the
Puebla, Â£41 in sovereigns, $20 in gold
and two gold rings. He met Pat
O'Donnell and John Hesslng, two sail
ors who were to have joined the Brit
ish ship Kilmory yesterday, and in
their company visited Barbary Coast.
Last night Officers Bean, Castor and
Clifford heard that O'Donnell and Hes
sing were spending English money
lavishly, so they locked them up on
suspicion. On them were found Â£36,
one ring and 56 45. Shortly afterward
McLeod showed up and said he had
been robbed and identified the two
men. Captain Ferguson of the Kil
mory had to get two more sailors be
fore his vessel could put to sea.
The schooner Actaea is fitting out at
Brooklyn, N. V., for St. Michael via
Bermuda and San Francisco. She has
been purchased by Captain Charles C.
McCarthy, late chief officer of the Pa
cific Mail Company's steamer Star
buck. She will bring out ten passen
gers, three of whom are women.
At a meeting of the Alaska Trade
Committee yesterday morning it was
decided to have an exhibit at the Min
ing Fair, showing the supplies neces
sary to last one man one year in the
Klondike, and also to have a cooking
exhibit, showing how the food should
be prepared in the Alaska gold fields.
The committee will distribute literature
and give all the information regarding
routes, sailing dates, fares, etc, and. In
fact, establish' a branch office at the
fair for the purpose of Informing those
who have been Induced to come via San
Francisco, on account of the fair, of
the real status of things in Alaska and
to give the most accurate data on all
points.
H. Calkskeln, the steward, and the
second mate of the barkentine Sharp
shooter, had a narrow Â«i ''ape from as
phyxiation yesteruiy. The barkentine
has been chartered to carry sugar from
Honolulu and as she was infested with
rats It was determined to kill them off
before putting the vessel into commis
sion. Accordingly everything was bat
tened down and a charcoal fire started
in the hold. The fumes awoke the
two men who had gone to sleep in their
bunks, and they were helped on deck
only Just in time. Calkskeln was ta
ken to the Harbor Receiving Hospital,
where Dr. Deas soon had him out of
danger.
On the 6th lnst. reinsurance was paid
in England on the following vessels:
British ship Glenpark. from Rio de
Janeiro for Astoria under charter to a.
W. McNear, S guineas per cent: Ra
venscrag, from Port Townsend to Cal

JURORS ARE
HARD TO FIND
Slow Progress Being
Made in the Figel
Murder Case.
' ..'â¢â¢â â '
Only Two Talesmen Were
Accepted Yesterday by
Both Sides.
The Other Citizens Examined Were
Disqualified for Various
Reasons.
A little better progress was made yes
terday In the work of impaneling a
Jury to try Theodore A. Figel, the
young bookkeeper who is accused of
having shot and killed Isaac Hoffman.
Two of the talesmen, A. Pauba, a re
tired tailor living at 833 Ellis street,
and R. Lewin, a blacksmith residing at
84 Belcher street, satisfactorily an
swered all of the questions asked them.
They were acceptable to both the prose
cution and defense, and were sworn in
by Clerk Tolle.
Figel, who will remain In the custody
of the Sheriff during the trial, arrived
in the courtroom at 9:30 o'clock, in
charge of Sheriff Whelan. He did not
appear to be in the least concerned.
When the examination of Frank Du
mont, If. Savage, A. H. Phelps, T.
Frahm, F. W. Whiteside, Henry Hamil,
A. Pauba. J. M. Merrill, A. S. Tubbs. W.
G. Doane, C. Cohen and R. Lewin, the
talesmen who were drawn Tuesday
evening, commenced, there were but
few spectators in the courtroom. The
case seems to have lost interest for the
idle and curious who thronged the Po
lice Court during the days of the pre
liminary hearing.
Talesmen Savage, Phelps, Hamil.
Doane, Tubbs and Cohen were excused
because they had fixed opinions. Tales
men Dumoni and Whiteside were per
emptorily challenged by the prosecu
tion, and the defense exhausted two per
emptory challenges on Talesmen Frahm
and Merrill.
Both sides then announced that they
were satisfied, and Pauba and Lewin
were sworn in.
Judge Cook then directed Clerk Tolle
to draw ten more names from the box.
! They were: Simon Scheellne, A. S.
i Lowndes, G. B. Barber, J. F. Murray,
Charles Nathan, Charles Coleman,
Lewis Joseph, William Kilday, W. S.
Chapman and H. Harms.
When adjournment hour arrived,
Kilday, Chapman and Harms remained
out of the ten to be examined. Schee
llne was excused because he had formed
an opinion; Lowndes and Murray be
cause they were not on the assessment
roll: Barber because he was opposed to
capital punishment, and Nathan, Colt
man and Joseph because they were
friendly to the families of both th?
dead man and the prisoner.
Another attempt will be made to-day
to complete thp jury.
RELEASED FROM HIS DEBTS
Willis PolÃ. the Architect of Bo-
hernia. Declared Insolvent
by Judge Slack-
Willis Polk, the architect of Bohemia, j
who failed for several thousands a few
months ago, has been granted n dis
charge from the Insolvency court and his
creditors must rest content. "When the
Polk insolvency proceedings came up be
fore Judge Slack yesterday morning for
NEW TO-DAY.
adjudication the H. S. Crocker Company
entered an opposition to his application
for a discharge from his liabilities. The
opposition alleged that the insolvent had
concealed some of his assets from his
creditors and as he was in the debt of
the H. S. Crocker Company to the
amount of $1500 it was anxious that his
application fee denied that it might get a
judgment against him for the amount
due.
A man by the name of Bowen, It was
alleged by the opposition, owed Polk
some $300u for services performed and
that he had not included the account in
his schedule of liabilities. Polk admitted
that he Lad received some money from
Bowen which he used for current expen
ses, but denied that any amount was due
him from that source. Testimony was
then introduced by Attorney Rothschild,
who represented the H. S. Crocker Com
pany, to show that when the insolvent
had been asked to show his books he pre
sented a set that showed evidences of
having been prepared for the occasion.
The evidence introduced to establish this
fact was insufficient, however, as it was
in relation to many other contentions of
the H. S. Crocker Company, and in con
sequence Judge Slack ordered that Polk
be discharged from his liabilities.

ECONOMY IN NEVADA.
WHETHER regarded as an industry, a pastime
or a method of practicing law, lynching in
Nevada is to continue for some time longer
unhampered by legal interference and unfretted by
public criticism. This is the only conclusion de
ducible from the refusal of the Douglass Grand Jury
to indict the lynchers in the Ãber case at Carson, for
it seems there was no lack of evidence against the
lynchers, but a most plentiful lack of desire to prose
cute them.
It is most fortunate in every respect that along
with the news of the refusal of the Grand Jury to in
dict there came an explanation of the cause of the
refusal. Had nothing been made public but the bare
report of the action of the jury, Eastern opinion
would have at once declared the case to be another
evidence of the wild and woolly lawlessness of the
West; while in the West itself there would have been
so many suggestions of "stuff" and "dough' and
"Colonel Mazuma" that the uninitiated would have
supposed the colonel keeps a bakery at Carson and
the Grand Jury had taken his cake.
The explanation which so opportunely came along
with the news saves the West and the people of Ne
vada from all injurious suspicions either on this
coast or beyond the Rockies. It makes known the
fact that the lynchers were permitted to go free
simply to save expense. It would have cost the
county a good deal of money to have prosecuted the
guilty parties, and bonanza days being over in the
sagebrush State there is no longer any money to
burn either in court or out of it. On that score the
lynchers were released by the thrifty members of the
Grand Jury, doubtless in the hope that having been
thus given rope enough they would eventually hang
themselves or one another without expense to the
county.
Thrift is the mother of all virtues. It is pleasing
to observe the cultivation of it among the people of
Nevada, where it has long been neglected. When
they have well learned how to save money they may
I-roceed to higher lessons of economy and learn how
to save lives and protect person as well as property.
Then they will know that thrift walks hand in hand
with la-.v, and that money expended in the perform
ance of justice is neither wasted nor lost.
In the meantime it is gratifying that the case when
fally examined makes a much better showing for the
people of Nevada than appears on the surface. An
effort, really in earnest on the part of the officers of
the law. was made to bring the lynchers to justice.
The Prosecuting Attorney did his work with zeal and
seems to have submitted to the jury abundant evi
dence to prove the case of the State against the ac
cused. A considerable number of the Grand Jury
also were ready and willing to act. Justice failed
simply because a number of thrifty citizens whose de
votion to economy would have made them excellent
Supervisors were by a freak of fortune turned from
that office and landed in the Grand Jury.
The practical joker who plays ghost and scares
people crazy has been at his work again. It is too
bad that something cannot be done with this fellow.
To be sure, some relative of the victim might knock
the head of the jocose idiot, and yet there is little
likelihood that any will be so thoughtful. The statute
can deal with crime fairly well; it provides for the
lunatic, but as to the fool it is still weak.
If Bennett was really insane when he stabbed his
wife seventeen times and cut his own throat, his re
covery just in time to escape to Victoria and fight
against being brought back was an instance of rapid
cure. It ought to impress any jury, the nature of the
impression depending, of course, upon the intelli
gence of the jury.
Frank Burnstein. who lived near Santa Cruz,
studied theosophy. and from some process not clear
to the worldly mind absorbed the idea that he could
live without food. It is painful to relate that Burn
stein was in error. His astral body may be all right,
but the body he left behind was a bag of bones.
Perhaps the United States army is a little weak
numerically, but there is nothing more impressive
known to modern military science than the new uni
form of General Miles.
There has been some concern because of the float
ing of counterfeit $100 notes, and yet the people who
have escaped annoyance do not seem particularly
glad of it.
Several Governors are in favor of annexation, and
several gentlemen who have hopes of going into the
same line of business are known to share this
feeling.
People who are fond of remarking upon coinci

the fact that Durrant and Figel were once class

POLLING AS AN ART
THERE is a brand of journalism which is afraid
to express an opinion until it has carefully
weighed the result in coin. One symptom of
it is the habit of polling. It does not care for the
right or wrong of any matter, but it does care how
the position it may take will strike the pocket. Its
brains are in its pocket, and had it a conscience this
would be there too.
The latest instance of this locally is in connection
with the fight of Los Angeles to free itserf from the
grip of the water company. The papers of that city
had been reduced to a state of submission. Three
of them did the bidding of the company, nor asked
any question unless perhaps as to the feasibility of
advancing the price of editorial support. It was ne
cessary that some paper not subject to local influence
should take up the fight of the people. This The Call
did freely, not stopping to inquire what the conse
quence would be to itself. Meanwhile yeflow jour
nalism held in abeyance such influence as it might
possess and began to feel its way. It resorted to the
'â poll."
There is only one construction to be placed on this
course when it is considered that the sheet taking it
is the Examiner. It wants to find whether it can
afford to espouse the cause of the people at the risk
of offending the water company, or whether its profit
able method will be to get on the payroll of the com
pany and :et the people go. On the returns from its
poll will rest the conclusion. There is never a pos
sibility of its doing anything from a conviction that
to do it would be right. It is not subject to this va
riety of conviction. A sheet which lacks the courage
to speak its little mind about a proposed monkey
ranch until it has taken one of its justly celebrated
polls cannot be expected to deal with a subject so
wide and far-reaching as the Los Angeles water
problem without having first got the consent of every
actual or possible subscriber concerned.
It follows, of course, that there is no importance to
be attached to the way the yellow toad may hop. It
can indorse the water company, and the reason for
doing so will be so plain that none will be deceived.
It can indorse the people, but the subject has already
been so exploited that even this unfortunate backing
will not weaken the people's case.
But there is really very little difference what it may
do. The controversy will be settled without its aid.
The point at issue is this mania for polling. Yellow
journalists will soon be afraid to announce a flood
without taking a poll of the citizens washed out. In
deed, the polling habit is only less virulent than the
affidavit habit, which impels the liar to swear to his
lies, but no less fervently to his accidental truths.
A BUGABOO WAR SCARE.
DESPITE the shudders and shrieks of yellow
journalists trying to get up a war scare over
the dispatch of the Maine to Havana, it is
notable that the business interests of the country are
not in the least concerned, and even Wall street, so
prone to excitement over every passing cloud, has not
had a flurry in any of its numerous pits and pools.
The incident shows in what contempt sensational
journalism is held throughout the country in all in
telligent circles, For weeks the yellow papers have
been screaming of coming war in type so big that
circus posters look mild in comparison. For weeks
they have been publishing interviews with the Gov
ernor of Cuba, the Prime Minister of Spain and a
host of other Spanish dignitaries, all breathing war
against the United States, and yet the public goes
right along paying no more attention to the lurid
news and the clamors of war than they would to the
gibbering of so many idiots shouting at passers from
the barred windows of a safe asylum.
Incidents of this kind are encouraging. We hear
so much of the influence of decadent journalism and
of the pernicious effects of the yellow monstrosities
there is at times a feeling of anxiety lest the whole
character of public opinion should be tainted by the
vicious depravities that emanate from such sources.
When we note, however, the indifference of the in
telligent portion of the community to such efforts of
yellow journalism as this war scare, we are freed
from all such fears. Decadent journalism is evi
dently one of the pestilences that affect only those
who by some taint of blood are predisposed to receive
them.
The bugaboo war scare passes as harmlessly over
the minds of the great bulk of the American people as
some noxious vapor from a sewer passes off from our
hills, blown away by the strong, pure breezes
of the ocean. The country has confidence in the abil
ity of the administration at Washington to guard
every American interest in Cuba and to effectually
aid in restoring peace to that unhappy island without
engaging in a needless war with Spain.
Yellow journalism must turn to some other source
for an international sensation. Probably it might
find one by getting an interview with Kaiser Wil
liam. One of our pictorial magazines is now running
a vivid story of a German invasion of the United
States, and it would take but little exercise of yellow
enterprise to transform magazine fiction into a news
paper realism that would serve, for a day at least, to
stir the pulses of the slums.
If anybody would rather die by faith than recover
by medicine the matter might be regarded as a per
sonal and private one, except that babies are some
times required to die by faith while yet too young to
appreciate its beauties. Resides this, come maladies
have the disadvantage of being catching, and germs
from them are likely to float to localities where the
people are not educated up to the point of curing
themselves by indulging in thought of a refined va
riety.
The revolting bestiality of the Clarks. now under
arrest or surveillance at Napa. has never been ex
ceeded so far as criminal annals show. Neither the
man nor woman is fit to live. The public has a right
to hope that exploitation of their foulness will be brief
and barren of further particulars.
While President Dole is speculating as to the fu
ture of Hawaii, and fearful lest the islands fall prey
to some greedy power, there is one possibility of
which he fails to make mention. What if the rightful
owners were to take a notion to rule themselves?
Natives of India have been scared into fasting by
the sight of an eclipse. Fasting is almost a habit
with them, but they usually have a better reason for
indulging in it, this being the absence of anything
edible.
The policeman anxious to make a record ought to
arrest a few of the peculiar people who leave horses
untied. The arrest of the horse is usually accom
plished after the damage has been done.
According to official records there is an abundance
of room in the local jails, and with so many thieves
and thtigs running loose it seems z pity that this
space should be going to waste.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY,
WE have striven successfully to impress the
American public with a correct idea of the
Hawaiian oligarchy, which is proposing to
sell that country to the United States for $4,000,000
to pay Dole's debts and about $8,000,000 a year pro
tection bounty on raw 'sugar. It has suited the an
nexationists in this country to deny these facts. "No
body is disenfranchised in Hawaii, ''they have insisted.
Senator Morgan, when confronted with our state
ment of the situation, cut across the question hy ap
proving the suppression of the native vote. While
in Hawaii at the expense of the oligarchy, which
omitted no hospitality, he told the natives that aftei
annexation they would be treated just like our
Southern negroes! After all this mixture of admis
sion and denial of Our statements, the truth is at last
confessed by a member of the Dole Cabinet. The
Chief Oligarch is away and the dissensions among the
.members of his government are taking shape.
Finance Minister Damon, in a public speech to the
members of the Government, has said:
"This question of the voting population being in
the minority cannot go on forever. * * * If we
are a republic we want to have a common country
and a common ground to work upon, and to .say that
a part of this community is to be kept outside the
pale seems to me a great mistake."
This is very broad and very valuable. It admits
government by the minority, as we have claimed. It
questions the existence of a republic at allâ "If we
are a republic"â and no colleague of Minister Damon
attempted to lift the imputation and its shadow off the
oligarchy.
In the light of this official confession the proposi
tion of Senator Bacon to submit to a vote of the
v hole Hawaiian people the question of annexation
gains an irresistible force.
Senator Morgan is struggling to divert public at
tention to some indecencies in which he indulges
toward Mr. Cleveland. But Americans are not to be
diverted in that way.
When a territory is to be admitted into this Union
the people make and offer to Congress a constitu
tion and they vote upon the question of admission.
In one instance Congress so changed a constitution
that the people voted not to enter the Union, refused
admission by a large majority, and there was no
power in the Federal Government to override their
will. Conrre<=s was compelled to concede the point
and then the people voted to enter the Union and the
Ftatc wa.s admitted.
Are we to violate all constitutional provisions and
repudiate all our povcrnmontal precedents just be
cause Dole pays a visit to get his $4,000,000 ol debts
paid and the planters want $8.000000 a year out of us?
Are we to let an oligarchy, which is not even
elected by the minority of voters admitted by Minister
Damon to exit, sell out a country under pretense
that it represents the people and is republican in
form, while Damon cries out, "IF we are a repub
lic!"
SENATOR TELLER burst into the Senatorial
debate on the silver resolutions on Tin
with such impassioned zeal that his fury car
ried him in one instance to a degree of rudeness that
shocked even his own sense of courtesy and brought
the flow of his raging rhetoric to a sudden stop. In
a half apologetic way he said afterward he would have
his offensive expression stricken from the record,
whereupon Senator Hoar, with the kindness of a
candid friend, advised him to have the whole speech
stricken out.
The advice of the calm Senator from Massachusetts
to his excited colleague from Colorado was judicious.
As an aspirant for the Presidency and a possible can
didate for that high office, Mr. Teller should keep
his head cool and beware of sudden heats. Red
hot speeches do not make campaign documents at
tractive to intelligent voters, and men who cannot
discuss coolly and reasonably grave matters of state
are not the kind that are chosen by the American
people to preside over the afTairs of the Union.
There is nothing in the occasion of the present
silver debate to greatly excite any one except a fan
atic who rages simply because he recognizes the im
potence of his rage. The silver Senators know very
well the House will never adopt the resolutions they
have submitted to the Senate and are now so ve
hemently discussing. They know, and they are aware
the country knows, the resolutions were introduced
simply to show the currency reformers that no re
form bill can pass the Senate at this session. The
whole thing is simply in the nature of a bluff, and to
make a successful bluff it is by no means necessary'
to create a volcano.
It is barely possible the rage of Senator Teller may
have been due to an excited fear on his part that the
bluflf will not work. The Senate may after all refuse to
adopt his resolutions. There are not so many silver
Republicans as there were a year ago. The party is
petting into line for currency reform, and some of the
Senators whom the silver men confidently counted on
when they boldly introduced their resolutions may be
found on the other side when the vote is taken. If
this be so. we can understand the wrath of the Sen
ator from Colorado. He will have seen himself about
to be hoisted by his own petard, and under such cir
cumstances excitement is natural.
As a matter of fact, the silver Senators are playing
a desperate game. There are several gold Democrats
in the Senate who will vote with the Republicans
against their resolutions. They can win only by ob
taining the votes of many so-called silver Republi
can^, and, as we have said, these are not so numerous
as they were.
By the St. Louis platform the Republican delegates
in Congress are pledged to the declaration, "We are
unalterably opposed to every measure calculated to
debase our currency or impair the credit of our
Government." Surely not many Republicans in Con
gress, even though favorable to silver, will violate that
pledge simply to head off a currency reform bill. It
is this aspect of the situation that gives interest to the
debate. Senator Teller's sound and fury may after all
signify something. It may mean that his bluff is
about to shoot from under him like a landslide.

found a singular Justification at
the < )pora In Vienna, where they were
playing "Tannhausi-r"' recently. Since
t).<- suppression of the official claque sev
eral artists of this theater have possessed
a private claque, composed of young en
thusiasts, whose manual labor is not
paid for. The tenor, Wlnklemann, and
the barytone, Reichmann, two celebrated
"Wagnerian singers, possess a very nu
merous and militant claque of this kind,
the members of which impose themselves
upon the public more than the old official
claque, without the director of the opera
or the police being able to Interfere in
any way. Now, one night lately the
"claques" of these two artists commenced
a battle against each other without as
signing any cause for this raising of
shields. In tho second act, after the allo
cution of "Wolfram d"Eschenbaeh, very
well sung by M. Reichmann, his claque
applannded vociferously for rive minutes.
M. Winklemann's claque got jealous and
began to cry, "Enough! enough:" and the
plaudits were Interrupted by hisses. M.
Reichmann let it be plainly seen that he
was furious. Arrived at the third act
and tho famous song of the "Evening

said some words to the conductor, which

On their side the director and the police

of the Wagnerian repertory, and neither

Little by little, sluwly the umbrella opens
and by the measure which he employs,
the sound of the voice ought to augment
to attain its full plenitude when the ob
ject is entirely open. Afterward the
contrary ought to take place: always
â lowly, poco a poco, the umbrella shuts
and the voices follow its evolution, di
minuendo, decrescendo. to arrive at pia

tinguished finally in a whisper when the
umbrella is completely folded. Is it not
marvelous, and can one comprehend

Some thoughts and aphorisms of Anton
Rubinstein: For the public, life is the
most serious thing and art is an amuse
ment; for the artist it Is the contrary;
art is everything and life is only a dis
traction.
Life is an enigma and death is the key
to it.
People talk of the fear of God; It is the
fear of man that one ought to have, for
God is merciful, while men do not par
don.
I am an adversary to capital punish
ment: for in inflicting the penalty of
death society places itself on the same
plane with the assassin; he has killed,
one kills him. The assassin should be
rendered inoffensive by being imprisoned
for life; I would suspend in his cell the
portrait of his victim and have a weapon
placed beside it. Perhaps remorse would
suggest to the assassin the idea of sui
cide, the only logical solution to the
crime, it appears to me.

Stops Token to Have San Frnnclsco
Properly Represented at the

The Chamber of Commerce has taken 'â 
prompt action to prevent the threat- ;
ened reduction in the force of mail car
riers of this city. The board of trus- j
tees held a special meeting yesterday j
afternoon, at which the report of the
First Assistant Postmaster General,
showing the necessity for retrenchment |
In the department, owing to the insulli- |
olent appropriation, was discussed at !
length. This report had been sent to [
the Chamber of Commerce by Postmas- i
ter Montague with the request that the j
representative organizations of the city j
appeal to the Congressional delegation j
to exert its influence with the postal I
authorities to prevent the crippling of I
the free delivery system In this city.
A series of resoluti <ns wore prepared
and adopted, setting forth that the lat- !
est reports issued by the Postoffl< â¢ De- |
partment show a steady increase in the i
business handled, and a corresponding
Increase in the receipts, indicating an J
improvement of business conditions I
throughout the country. They also set
forth that the present Congressional .
appropriation under which the Postal
Department is being operated is insuf- :
ficient, and in consequence the Post- i
master-General contemplates certain |
retrenchments, including the cutting '
down of the letter carrier force, which, ]
In the judgment of the board of trus- j
tees of the Chamber of Commerce, :
â would be injurious to the best interests j
of the people. The resolutions conclude
as follows:
Rfsolved. That in the opinion of this ;
chamber, no backward step should be j
taken In the administration of the postal I
affairs of the country; that the service |
should not only be held up to its present j
efficiency, but that it should be progres
sive and bo kept abreast of the wants of
the peopje.
Resolved. That our delegation In Con
gress be urged to favor such liberal ap
propriations for the postal service as well
prevent deficiencies necessitating undue
retrenchment in the present service, and
that, to this end, we invite special atten- j
tion to the estimates and recommenda- !
tlons as outlined in the report of the j
Hon. First Assistant Postmaster-General j
for the fiscal year ending June 30, li>97, j
and ask favorable action thereon.
The resolutions will be forwarded to !
the members of the California delega- |
tion and to the Postmaster-General at
once.
â  Mayor Phelan attended the meeting
at the invitation of the trustees to dis- J
cuss the proposition to have San Fran
cisco suitably represented at the trans- I
Mississippi and International Exposi- j
tion, to open at Omaha next June, and |
continue for six months. Mayor Phe- j
lan was anxious that the city and j
county should make a creditable show- j
ing, and promised his hearty co-opera- j
tion. A letter the Mayor bad sent to i
the chamber a few days previously
was read. In it he stated that th*
Hoard of Supervisors would undoubted
ly aid the movement financially to a
limited extent, which it was empowered
to do under the general law. FivÂ»>
thousand dollars was allowed for ad
vertising the city and $3000 of this had
been appropriated for the Golden Ju
bilee, but there remained $2000 in thf
fund which co-uld be drawn on. The
rest of the necessary funds would have
to be raised by private subscription.
The trustees appointed a committee
of six to confer with the Board of
Trade, Mechanics" Institute and the
four representatives of the Exposition
In this city as to the best means of
sending on a suitable exhiWt.
A communication was read from C.

FIENDS POISON
DOMESTIC PETS
A Number of Complaints
Recently Made to
the Police.
J. C. Fredericks, Steiner Street,
Loses Four Valuable Mal
tese Cats.
Dr. Creely States That a Larje Num
ber of Cases Have Been Brought
to His Attention.
' Numerous complaints have been
made to the police recently, not only of
valuable doga having been stolen to
meet the demand for the Klondike, but
also of dogs, cats, fowls and other do
mestic pets having been poisoned.
Yesterday J. C. Fredericks. 1612 Stein
or street, called upon Chief Lees and
complained that within three weeks
I four valuable Maltese cats belonging to
him had beer, poisoned. Three of them
met the same fate on the night of Jan
i vary 5 and the other on Monday night.
Fredericks had with him a tin dish half
filled with fish, which he had taken
| from a neighbor's yard. Dr. Creely had
j analyzed the fish and found large quan
tities of strychnine mixed with it. He
i suggested that some action should be
| taken by the police to find out the poi
i soners, as he had not only lost his cats,
! but also several valuable fowls by poi
: son.
Dr. Creely accompanied Fredericks,
! and he told the Chief that a large nura
i ber of people had come to him recently,
! asking him to analyze the stomachs of
dogs and cats that had evidently been
poisoned, and In every case he had
found the presence of strychnine. He
could pot account for the epidemic of
poisoning animals, unless it was done
by some evil-disposed persons without
any ulterior motive. About a week ago
he was called to South San Francisco
to attend a young colt that had been
horribly cut with a knife by some fiend.
The owner could offer no apparent rea
son for the dastardly act, as he could
not think of any enemy who would be
guilty of venting his spite upon the I
dumb brute.
The Chief sent for Captain Bohen,
and the Captain was instructed to de
tail a couple of detectives to look into |
the Fredericks case, and. if possible, :
discover the perpetrator of the poison
ing of the cats and fowls. It is a fel
ony to administer poison to animals,
and if the perpetrator is caught an ex
ample will be made of him or her.
In regard to the poisoning of dogs.
| the Chief thought that it might be done
i by burglars with the object of getting
j the faithful sentinels out of the way.
j He assured Fredericks and Dr. Creely
I that the department would do every-
J thing possible to stop the crime, and mi
i structions would be given to the Cap
! tains of each district to notify their
men to be on the lookout for the poi
ooners. _______________

THE SAX FKAXCISCO CALL, Till RSDAY, JANTJABY 27, 1898.
DEATH ENDS
HIS MISERY
Baldwin Gardiner Sue-
cumbs to a Stray
Shot.
Suffered for Weeks, Surrounded
by Hi? Family and
Friends.
An Attempted Burglary Led to the
Shooting, Which Is Surrounded
in Mystery.
Baldwin Gardiner, an aged stock
broker, who was shot, supposedly by
Adam Stroh, a burglar, on ChriÃtmas
day. died last evening at the Waldeck,
surrounded by his family and friends.
At the time of the shooting it was
thought by the physicians that the
wound, which was over the heart,
would prove fatal, and last evening the
prognosis proved correct.
The cause of the shooting and the
developments which followed aroused
general interest and the news sur
rounding the case was anxiously
watched. On Christmas night the
household was arousoj by a noise made
by Stroh. and Mr. Gardiner went to the
roar in search of the intruder. De
tectives had surrounded the house, and
shortly after ths burglar was discov
ered hanging to a porch railing in the
rear a shot was heard and the deceased
fell to the floor fatally wounded.
A dying statement was made which
accused Stroh of having fired the fatal
shot, but after developments created a
general opinion that a patrol driver
had unintentionally shot the stock
broker. Investigation followed and
it is now probable a charge of murder
will be placed against Stroh, but It Is the
general opinion that the burglar will
be vindicated.
After the shooting: the deceased
was carried to his apartments In his
home at LISS Geary street and Dr. Rix
ford was hurriedly called. Drs. Cheney
and Dosler soon followed and all was
done to make the sufferer comfortable.
< >n the 4th of this month the suffering
man was taken to the Waldock, where
he died. The cause for the removal was
not generally known, but it is suppose d
that It was thought by the family
that more attention would be given the
deceased at the hotel than could be ar
1 for at the reside:
The deceased, who was 59 years of
â  live of New York, was
well km>wn throughout the coast, and
for years had been prominently con
nected with the leading local stock
brokers. He had been known as a
thorough business man and thoroughly
honorable in all his dealings.
The Coroner's office was notified of
tho doath and the body was removed
to the Morgue.
Verdict for One Dollar.
The jury in the case of Samuel 1,. Thel
lor against Thomas Ross, a suit In the
United States Circuit Court to recover
$20,000 damages for an alleged infringe
ment of patent on a fruit dryer, returned
a verdict yesterday morning awarding to
the plaintiff damages in the sum of $1 and
costs.

TOO MUCH WORK
FOR SOLDIERS
Caring for the Big Rifles
and Mounting the New
Mortars.
Suggestion to Increase the Force
of Artillerymen at the
Presidio.
The Post at Angel Island Could Be
Abandoned Without Detriment
to the Service,
There is a feeling among some of the
commissioned officers and enlisted men
of the Third United States Artillery
that the work of caring for the new
guns recently placed In position, to
gether with the labor of mounting the
new mortar battery, is more than
should be imposed on the two compa
nies of heavy artillery detailed for duty
at the Presidio. The fact Is taken into
consideratifm that trje companies of
the First T'nited States Infantry, sta
tioned at the post, perform all the
guard and fatigue duty of the garrison
proper. It is said that the time of
guard duty to the infantry soldier
comes but once in a f'Ttnlght. Two
days of extra duty at the garrison dur
ing the same peric-d of time gives him
three days of duty in two weeks, while
the artilleryman must work eight hours
a day every day in the week saving
Sunday.
The men of the light batteries having
their own guns and h<>rst s to care for,
arc not obliged to work on the fortifi
cations, honce the burden of tcril falls
on the soldiers of the heavy artillery.
It is said that the work could be appor
tioned with greater fairness if the two
batteries of heavy artillery now sta
tioned at Angel Island were brought to
the Presidio.
It is clearly a military necessity that
Urn** Point, Aleatraz and Fn-t Mason
should be garrisoned with artillerymen,
but there seems to be no good reason
for keeping batteries of the Third Ar
tillery or tmnps of any other arm o-f
the service at Angel Island.
It is reported that Genera] Shafter.
commanding the Department of Cali
fornia, has in mind thÂ»Â« establishment
Of an artillery camp near the recently
mounted modern guni on the Presidio
reservation. Should this plan be carried
out the batteries now stationed rm An
gel Island could be transferred to the

mainland and employed where their
services are most required.
The department commander's plan of
having the infantry perform all the
Kuard duty at the Presidio so as to re
lieve the artillery from all service of
this kind was highly commended by
th.- Assistant Secretary of War. The
addition of two companies of heavy
artillery to the present garrison at the
Presidio need not disturb the existing
order of duty so far as the Infantry
companies are concerned.
Colonel If. P. Miller. Third Artillery,
with headquarters now at Angel Isl
and. Is two days the senior In rank of
Colonel Evan Miles, First Infantry,
now commanding 1 the post at the Pre
sidio. The Impression prevails among
the troops that Colonel Miller could
not come to the Presidio without dis
placing Colonel Miles, as post com
mander. If both officers were station
ed at the garrison the senior would be
entitled to command the post, but no
good reason seems to exist why an
artillery station or camp Ehould not be
established near the mortar battery,
two miles distant from the Presidio
Barracks.
Much time is lost every day in taking
the troops from the barracks at the
Presidio out to the heavy fortifica
tions. The troops are brought in for
th<> noon meal and taken out again for
the afternoon' 3 work. Sooner or later
there must be a force of artillery with
in immediate reach of the guns ap
pointed to defend the harbor. It is ad
mitted by all the military authorities
that this will be done when another
regiment of artillery is ordered to this
city. Four batteries of the Third Ar
tillery could now be made very com
fortable in tents near the mortar bat
teries and 12-inch guns.
The proposed review and sham bat
tle at the Presidio to-morrow ought to
assemble a multitude of spectators.
The evolutions will take place on the
parade plain within the immediate
view of the spectators. There will be no
attempt to solve a problem In tactics
by deploying troops on the hills of the
reservation. This might be interest
ing from a purely military point of
view, but would not afford much pleas
ure to the visitors from the city.
GRAY AGAIN IN TROUBLE.
The Youth flcquitted of Robbery

Bert C Gray, the youth who was ar
quitted a few days ago on the charge of
robbing and nearly murdering the old

Yesterday P. J. Sullivan, a furniture
dealer at 1504 Flllmore street, swore to a
complaint In Judge Joachlmsen's court
for the arrest of Gray on the charge of
potty larceny. Sullivan states that on
September 16 Gray called ut his store
and represented that he had some fur
niture to sell, as he was going to a rain-h
at Napa. Sullivan went to the house
with him and bought three pieces of fur
niture for ISO. A few days later Gray's
stepfather. W. H. Miller, called upon
Sullivan and claimed the furniture. Mil
ler subsequently recovered the furniture
on a search warrant.

ALL the programme for yester
day's Jubilee entertainment was
contributed by the soldiers. All
the athletes of the National Guard
companies of San Francisco and
of the United States troops stationed at
the forts around the bay contributed
their share, and their efforts made a
chining feature of the amusements of
the week's festivities. The sports were
almost all of a military character, and
each event was greeted with ringing
applause. The crowd was not as great
as was expected. It was almost too
cold to sit aJI the afterno-on in the
grandstand with comfort to Califor
nians, and that possibly accounted for
the comparatively small attendance. It
was estimated there were about one
thousand persons present, and what
thej r lacked in numbers they made up
in enthusiasm, and the competitors In
nearly all the events had about an
Soldiers Show Their Agility.
equal division of admirers to spur them
on.
Lieutenant Leon S. Roudiez, quarter
master First Infantry, was the man
ager of the entertainment and he was
assisted by Lieutenant D. E. Nolan.
The referee for the military and nov
elty events was Lieutenant J. ML Neall
of the Fourth Cavalry, and the Judges
were Lieutenant Charles T. Menoher
and Lieutenant John P. Halnes of the
Third Artillery and Lieutenant W. M.
Crofton of the First Infantry. The
starter was Lieutenant T. G. Carson
at the Fourth Cavalry and the clerk of
the course was Lieutenant James N.
Pickering of the First Infantry.
The first event on the programme was
a hundred-yard dash. There were twen
ty-two entries and it was run in three
heats.
There were six contestants in the
final dash. They got off well at the
crack of the pistol and the race was a
close and pretty one. Private Stram
of Company H, First Infantry, was the
winner, with Sergeant O'Marie of Com
pany C only a few inches behind him.
The time was 11 seconds.
Three soldiers of the First infantry
worked hard for five minutes digging:
a hole in the hard sand with their bay
onets and the tin plates they carry in
their haversack?. It was a competition
in hasty entrenching. The contestants
were Private Waldmann of Company
G, Sergeant Lang of Company D and
Private Anderson of Company EL Pri
vate Anderson was declared the winner,
he having dug the deepest hole and put
up the largest embankment of earth
before htm to stop the bullets of an
enemy. Private Waldmann was given
the second prize. He was somewhat
handicapped. He struck a large iron
water pipe a few inches under the sur
face of the spot where he commenced
to dig.
The wall-scaling event was a walk
over for the regulars. Two teams of six
men each, one from Company L, N. IJ.
C, and one from Company D, First In
fantry, entered for the contest. A
smooth wall ten feet high was con
structed, and the soldiers were to get
over it with all their military accouter
ments. Each man was to fire a shot
from his rifle from the top of the wall
and five more after he had reached the
ground on the opposite side. The regu
lars boosted each other over the wall
in quick time, and their whole team
was lined up on the other side waiting
for Inspection by the Judges long be
fore the last man of the National Guard
team had reached the top of the fence.
The gun detachment contest was the
most novel feature of the entertain
ment. Two teams from Light Battery
F. Third Artillery, were in the race.
Two guns, with their limbers, were
wheeled Into line, and at the word they
were loaded and fired, then the gun
carriages were taken apart and put to
gether again, and loaded and fired a
second time. The team commanded by
Sergeant Rathbun was declared the
winner. One minute and twenty-eight
seconds was the time occupied by the
winning team. â¢ The other team was
about a second behind them.
The high jump was won by Private
Honney of Company C, N. G. C, with
Private Hoffman of Company B second,
and Corporal Belden of Company C
third.
There were fourteen entries In the
220-yard run. It was won by Private
Fernandez of Troop X, Fourth Cavalry,
with Private Saunders of Company C,
N. G. C, a close second.
The shoe race was a novel and Inter
esting feature. There were fourteen
entries. The contestants took off their
shoes and mixed them up in a heap.
Then they raced fifty yards to them,
and the man who first picked out his
shoes and put them on and returned
to the starting point was the winner.
The contestants threw each other's
shoes all over the field, and it was a
lively race after them. Trumpeter
Merry of Troop I, Fourth Cavalry, was
the winner, with Corporal Curley of
Troop X second, and Private Taylor of
Troop X third.
The tent-pitching contest was won by
a team from Company C, First Infan
try. The team from Troop X, Fourth
Cavalry, was second, and the team of
Company D was third.
The equipment race, in which the sol
diers scattered their accouterments in
running 100 yards and gathered them
up and put them on on their way back,
was an interesting feature. It was run
in two heats. One for the United States
troops and one for the men of the Na
tional Guard, as their equipment differs
in some respects. In the race of the
regular soldiers. Private Nandell of
Company G, First Infantry, was first;

some very pretty cuts and parriee, even
though the melee was a bad one. The
team from Troop I, composed of Pri

MUSIC AND FLOWERS.
A Three- Day Floral Festival
Opens To-Day at Union
Square.
The Miners' Band, from Calaveras
County, with its brilliant uniform, is
proving itself extremely useful to the
Jubilee parade committee by its at
tendance and music at various Jubilee
functions. To-day the members of the
band will spend the entire day at the
flower market at Union Square, un
der the management of the California
Club. The music and the bright uni
forms of the men will, when combined
with the delicate yet gorgeous display
of California flowers, form a most
pleasing sight. The band has also
tendered its services for children's day
at the park and will render selections
throughout the entire day.
FUN FOR THE CHILDREN.
Saturday Will Be Devoted to
Entertaining the Little
Ones.
So well have the subscriptions of late
been coming in to swell the Jubilee
fund that the parade committee has
been enabled to appropriate an addi
tional JSOO to the fund for insuring the
success of Children's Dayâ January 29 â
at Golden Gate Park, making a total
fund of $1000.
At 10 o'clock on Saturday morning a
competitive drill and a series of calis
thenic exercises, open to the children
of the public, private and parochial
schools of San Francisco, will take
place at the park. To the school ex
celling in the competition, a handsome
silken banner will be awarded by the
parade committee. These exercises will
be under the supervision of George S.
Mlehling of the Olympic Club and H. C.
F. Stahl. The companies of school chil
dren, either boys or girls, intending to
compete in drilling at Golden Gate
Park on Children's Day will consist of
fifty-six each, one captain, two lieuten
ants, five sergeants and forty-eight in
rank.
A number of wagons and a quantity
of straw has been secured by the com
mittee in order that the children may
enjoy straw rides from dawn until
dark. Refreshments, consisting of
candy, fruits, milk, popcorn, sand
wiches, etc., will be served to them,
and the Board of Park Commissioners
has arranged that the use of the don
keys, goats and merry-go-rounds shall
be free to the little people throughout
the day.
The historical floats in the parade
will be on exhibition in suitable placfs
in the park during Children's Day, and
concerts will be rendered by a band.
PREPARING FOR THE FAIR
An Old Mission Dolores Bell
Will Announce the Open
ing of the Exhibit.
One of the bells from old Mission
Dolores will sound the announcement
of the opening of the Mining Fair. Af
ter reposing for 120 years in the turret
of the old church It is to be taken
down and brought to the Mechanics'
Pavilion, where, in conjunction with
other celebrated bells, it will be sound
ed by President McKinley, who will
touch an electric button at the White
House, starting the chimes ringing.
The interior of the Pavilion is being
filled with a number of scenic views of
the Klondike, taken from photographs
secured during the last year. These,
painted in vivid colors, in which an
icy white is predominant, are sufficient
in themselves to make those who see
them prefer to remain in California,
where the sun shines every day in the
year.
Some of the counties were very tardy
in preparing their exhibits, and in
consequence hundreds of men are be
ing rushed day and night in order to
get them in proper position for the dis
play, but everything, it is expected,
will be fully in readiness for the open
ing night, as an elegant banner, or
trophy, is to be awarded to the county
having the most complete display.
A suggestion has been made that in
stead of the parade, with which it was
intended to signify the close of the Jub
ilee and the opening of the Mining
Fair, masqueraders be allowed to roam
tbe streets.
McKinley Will Press the Button.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 26â The ar
rangements for the touching of the
electric button by President McKinley
on Saturday night, opening the "Golden
Jubilee Fair" in San Francisco, were
completed to-day. A mistake regarding
the time was made by the delegation
on midway, but it was corrected by
Senator Perkins, who was notified, as
were all the California delegates to-day
that the President would open the ex
position at 11 o'clock on Saturday night
which is 8 o'clock. San Francisco tiire'
The California delegation will be pres
ent at the ceremony in Washington at
the President's invitation.
Fireworks for Saturday Night.
The board of managers of the Mining
Fair met last night and decided to
make an attempt to interest the Jubilee
committee in making a grand display
at the opening ceremonies of the fair.
It was thought that the Jubilee com
mittee might make an appropriation
from its funds or assist In raising fur.dÂ§
to give a pyrotechnic display on Satur
day night from the dome' of the City
Hall.
It was decided to send oat circulars
to those manufacturers who control a
steam whistle or bell asking them to
sound them on Saturday night at 8
o'clock to announce the opening of the
fair.

A SHOWMAN
The Rich Man Thriftily
Garners Two-Bit
Coins.
Charged a Price for_ the Use
of His Windows Last
Monday.
Nearly Got a Beating, and Mourns
That Paying Patrons Were
so Scares.
W. H. Bradbury Is not content with
the fame that has crowned him. He
wants more. He thinks his halo needs
additional polish. He vindicated the
right of a citizen to spit on a car, floor,
and paid $5 for It. It was he who kick
ed a piano-tuner down stairs, paying
for thi? privilege also, and from time
to time he has been engaged in contro
versy tending to win renown, and es
tablish beyond cavil his love of liberty,
of the nickel and the two-bit piece and
to demonstrate that the humble copper
was not beneath his notice. His latest
essay has been in the show business,
and was not wholly successful, Brad
bury having neglected to secure a man
ager. The result is that, now that the
show is over, and advertising can do
-â  him no good, he is getting it. This story
is an incident of Monday when the
town turned out to see the parade.
Window seats commanding a good
view were in lively demand, as a mat
ter of course, all along the line of
march. People who lived on the streets
through which the gorgeous pageant
wended were visited by friends who,
perhaps, had not called on them for
many a day. In very many cases, too,
even strangers were received into the
favored houses which provided an op
portunity for viewing the sight, and
California!! hospitality, as usual,
showed itself worthy of its world-wide
reputation.
W. 1?. Bradbury resides In a stately
dwelling at the corner of California
street and Van Ness avenue, and was
among those who "received." Hospi
tality was not his motive. His recep
tion was held in a vacant double house
on Van Ness avenue, corner of Bush
street. It was no exclusive affair. No
invitations were issued for the event,
but any one was welcome to view the
grand spectacle of the day as the guest j
of the big millionaire; anybody will- j
ing to put up two bits for the privilege j
of peeping through the windows.
As the time drew near for the rising '
of the curtain on the great spectacular !
extravaganza the manager of the en- i
terprise "took a peep at the house," as !
is the wont of such thrifty managers, j
and â paradoxical as it may seem â he I
discovered that standing room outside
was at a premium, with very little !
money inside. Only a baker's dozen
of people had paid the established fee
for a seat behind the Bradbury win- j
dows, while the front steps were crowd- |
ed with men, women and chjld^n.
Showman Bradbury swooped down
upon the throng on his steps and read j
the riot act. The people must enter
the house â after going through the for
mality of paying two bits for the privi
lege â or they must leave the premises.
The aforesaid people â or at least some
of them â declined to adopt either al
lernative. and some vigorous dialogue
â risued. One lady who was burdened
-ith a baby in arms refused to sub
* nit to the proposed levy for the bene
fit of the Bradbury exchequer, and
was told by the showman that if she
did not get off the steps he would put
her off. She dared him to do it, and he
placed his hands upon her shoulders
and pushed her down a couple of steps,
when an indignant male observer of
the episode interfered and announced
his willingness to knock daylight injo
the Bradbury skull. In earnest of his
good faith he grabbed the capitalistic
collar and yanked the capitalist back
ward and forward through space a
good many consecutive times in a very
few moments.
A policeman arrived on the scene
about this time, and to him Mr. Brad
bury appealed for protection against
"the mob," which he ordered the guar
dian of the peace to disperse instanter.
The officer took in the situation at a
glance, ruminated for a fraction of a !
second on the nature of the occasion, j
and judicially decided that '"the mob"
was doing no harm at the threshold of
Dives, so he declined to interfere, and
the big rich man went inside again to
mourn over the paucity of two-bit
pieces.
Mr. Bradbury was Been at his nala- j
tial residence last night and asked re- j
pardlng this incident. He declared that !
his purpose In clearing his steps was
the fear that they would collapse under
the unusual weight upon them, they j
being, as he asserted, weakened by
lung decay.
"I was afraid of some one getting
hurt." he said. "I didn't want any one i
to suffer on my premises â and sue mo. j
for damages. I had a right to charge
People for the use of my house during
the parade. Lots of people did the same
thing, didn't they?"
"Oh. yes; many of them made money !
that way."
"Did they? Well. I didn'tâ l hardly ;
â ^ uule a good day's wages for a labor- i
Sng man!"
An injured look and a troubled sigh
Indicated that the interview was at an i
end. â

A FORGOTTEN NEWSPAPER.
Alex Badlam's First Attempt at Journalism, the "Weekly Prospector,"
of Quincy, Amador County.
Among his many other occupations, Alex Badlam was once a newspaper man, and his death, recalling mem
ories of his early life among the miners, has brought to light his first effortâ a copy of the Prospector, dated May
26, 1555. number 10 of volume I. It was not a very imposing sheet, but it served its purpose for nearly a year.
The issue of the Prospector for May 26, 1855. is owned by James B. Stevens. Assistant United States Ap
praiser, and he says he would not part with it for anything. He was a BUDscrlber from the time Badlam printed
the first number until it closed publication. Badlam was then running a "miner's supplies" store in Quinc* a
little town about five miles northeast of where the town of lone now stands. Quincy is nothing but a memory
now, but when the weekly issue of the Prospector went to press it was a flourishing place. The paper was printed
at No. 5 Broadway, which was what the townspeople called the county road within the town limits. Badlam had
a partner by the name of Clark, but he had not much to do with the paper. Badlam â¢rrote it. set the type and printed
it on a wooden press he had built himself. Its price was 12^ cents a copy, and its subscription list included nearly
every one in the district. When Badlam moved away from Quincy the paper died, for no one around that part of
the country would try his hand at journalism.
The paper was accidentally found by Mr. Stevens in one of his old school books about twenty years ago. He
remembered the paper, but thought he had lost all the numbers. He was looking over his old bonks one day to
revive his memories of school, and between the leaves lay the Prospector of May 26, 1855. He has kept is care
fully ever since, and its pages would form Interesting reading for the old pioneers of Amador County.

ST. SAVAS` DAY
Local Servians Celebrate
Their National
Holiday.
Religious Services at the Slavo

in the Evening.
I_adlÂ«s and Gentlemen Make Merry
Honor of Their Country's
Patron Saint.
The celebration of Pt. Savas 1 day, the
Servian national holiday, in commem
oration of their patron saint, was
brought to a fitting conclusion by a
| banquet given by the Servian-Montene
j grin Literary and Benevolent Society
lat Lodge Hall, on Polk street, last
evening. Covers were laid for 175
guests, every seat being occupied by
I the members and their ladies when at
8:30 o'clock Rev. Father Sebastian Dab
ovich, a native of San Francisco, who
i was seated at the right of the presi
i dent, arose to perform the beautiful
ceremony of blessing the bread.
Addressing the assemblage in the
Slavonic language, the priest first gave
a brief outline of the life and work of
j St. Savas, after which he pronounced
blessing upon the bread and wine be
fore him. Then, as he passed it to the
older persons to partake of, he accom
| panied the offering with this benedic
tion: "As ye drink of this wine and eat
of this bread, the full of the earth, so
I would bless you and have you live in
the true faith, In virtue, charity and
unity."
At the conclusion of this ceremony a
vigorous attack was made on the deli
cacies with which the three long tables
were heaped. The banquet hall had
j been artistically decorated for the oc
: casion, while rarely has a company
been invited to a more tempting repast.
President CJlavinovich presided, and
when the assemblage had done full jus
; tice to the edibles, delivered a brief ad
j dress. This was followed by. a pro
gramme of exercises in entire harmony
with the occasion, and the national and
historical events of the people.
St. Savas was born in the twelfth
I century. He was the youngest son of
Stefan Nemanja, who united the Ser
vians in their first kingdom. Leaving
his home secretly, he secluded himself,
;at the age of 17 years, in the holy
I Mount Athos. Finally, on beinjf dis
covered, yielding to the tears of their
son, his parents allowed him to remain
there in prayer and study. It was after
the death of his father, when the wise
j Germanus, patriarch of Constantinople,
| heard of the holy life of this hermit,
' and on examining him as to his ability
*and consulting with the episcopate of
his patriarchate, announced that he de
sired to consecrate Savas archbishop
for the Servians. But Savas, in his hu
mility, declined the dignity and said
he was willing to go to his people as a
worker, but for an archbishop a better
and more qualified man should be
sought. However, being prevailed upon
by his brothers, the people and the pa

triarch, Savas consented, and he be
came the first archbishop of the Ser
vian Autocephalo* Orthodox Church,
which ever since has been in full com
munion with the Eastern Apostolic
Church.
St. Savas' greatest work was the
opening of schools, which multiplied
throughout tho country. Re educated
a new choir of faithful clergy in place
of the few (Jre.k missionaries left in
the country. It was in 1222 when the
apostle of the Servians crowned his
brother Dushan Emperor of the Slbs
and Slaveni, his dominion having
spread fiom the Adriatic to the Black
Sea and "rom the Danube to the South
ern Archipelago. The preat and good
Archbishop fixed a firm foundation for
the orthodox Christian church in the
Balkan country by creating twelve dio
ceses and consecrating fur them tw<-!ve
Servian Bishops. In praise of their
first teacher the Slavonians in San
Francisco sung their odes in their
music and language, or which the great
Sehaffarik in his Slavische Spracheund
Literatur says the following* "Servian
songs resemble the tune of the violin;
old Slavonian that of the organ^ Polish
that of a guitar. The old Slavonian in
its psalms is like the loud rush of the
mountain stream: the Polish like the
bubbling and sparkling of a fountain,
and the Servian like the quiet murmur
ing of a streamlet in the valley."
The Servian holiday began Tuesday
evening by a nocturnal service in their
church on Powell street. Yesterday
morning the divine liturgy of St. John
("hrysostom was offered by Father Se
bastian.
The officers of the society under
whose auspices the banquet was given

Supervisor Delany Buys a Kinetoscope for
the Morgue.
"Cappun" Delany, chairman of the Health and Police Committee of
the Board of Supervisors, has posed before the public In many striking
roles, but his best friends never heretofore accused him of being a humor
ist. Yet if ordering a kinetoscope for Coroner Hawkins to pursue his Inves
tigations at the Morgue is not in the humorous line, then his brother Su
pervisors are at sea. According to Supervisor Hasklns and others, that is
Just what Delany has done, sent a kinetoscope to the Morgue and had the
Coroner and all his assistants mystified for a week, wondering if this great
City Father expects the cadavers to pose before the instrument and go over
their actions at the time of shuffling off the mortal coil for the benefit of
the officials and science in general.
According to the persons who relate the tale with great gusto, never
have they failed to provoke mirth unto the tear limit. That is why Delany
stands crowned to-day as the most subtle humorist the town affords. The
way of it is this:
Some time ago Coroner Hawkins went to Delany and explained that
several instruments were badly needed in cases calling for an autopsy.
Among them was a microscope. The "Cappun" listened impatiently to the
official's plea, and grumbled a little bit over the expense, but finally decided
to order the instrument. In a few days they all arrived at the Morgue
with the exception of the microscope.
"Captain," said Hawkins one day, as he met Delany on the street,
"where is that microscope you promised to get me?"
"Oh, a microscope, is it?" was the reply. "Well, I'll attend to that
right away."
Delany was as good as his word In one way, at least. The same day he
walked into a leading optician's and ordered a kinetoscope sent down to the
Morgue. "Let it be of the choicest," he stated, in his usual emphatic man
ner.
The kinetoscope went to the Morgue all right Hawkins happened in
shortly after its arrival and was shown the instrument by the wondering
deputies. "Great Caesar's ghost!" he yelled, when he viewed the instru
ment, "what does he think we are going to do with that thing? Does he
think the dead are going to dance around in front of it and show off for
the benefit of science?"
The matter was kept a strict seoret and the kinetoscope sent back
where It had come from. Cut the rest of the Supervisors heard of It and
went to Delany about it. "Oh, a microscope it was they wanted, was it?"
said Delany, with a puzzled expression, meanwhile stroking his military
mustachios fiercely, "well, how do they expect me to know the difference
between a microscope and a kinetoscope? Them things is not in my line,
anyway."
ARE DIVIDED IN
THEIR VIEWS
Freeholders Cannot Agree on
the Matter of Fran
chises.
The Majority Are in Favor of Letting
Them Go to the Highest
Bidder.
The Board of Freeholders had the
matter of the powers to be vested In the
Supervisors under consideration again
last night and but little headway was
made. The members were unable to
agree as to the extent of the authority
to be granted to the Finance Committee.
P. H. McCarthy argued that the Leg
islative Committee should have made
provision for the examination by the
Finance Committee of the books and
accounts of private corporations doing
business with the city.
L. R. Ellert thought Puch a provision
unnecessary, but after a lengthy debate
the entire section was referred back to
the Legislative Department Committee,
on motion of Joseph O'Connor, with in
structions to Incorporate In it provisions
In accordance with McCarthy's sugges
tion.
The matter of fixing the terms on which
street railway franchises shall In future
be awarded provoked a lengthy discua
â fcoa. The sub-committee reported in fa
vor of awarding the franchises to the
highest bidders, on condition that not less
than 3 per centum of the gross receipts
of the road for the first five years. 4 per
centum for the next ten years and 5 per
centum for the last ten years be paid Into
the city treasury, such payments to be
BMkde each month.
Alfred Cridge opposed the percentage
plan, as he believed the companies would
not act fairly by the city, and, moreover,
would argue, in the event of fares being
reduced, that the city was being injured,
as the gross receipts would be correspond
ingly reduced. He believed that the Su
pervisors should not be allowed to grant
railroad franchises until after the people
had first been given an opportunity to
show at the polls whether they wanted
the new road.
L. R. Ellort. Joseph Britton and E. R.
Taylor opposed Cridge's plan. They said
that if the Supervisors did not look after
the interests of the city in the granting
of franchises their acts could be vetoed
by the Mayor.
Cridge's motion to have proposed fran
chises first submitted to the people was
lost by the following vote: Ayes â Ander
son, Butler, Cridge, McCarthy and O'Con
nor. Noesâ Britton, Clement, Comte, El
lert, Gutte, Sachs, Taylor and Thompson.
McCarthy then offered as a substitute
for the original section, that all fran
chises for railroads furnishing power or
light be awarded to the highest bidder,
t h>- same percentage as originally pro
posed being deducted from the gross re
ceipts and paid Into the treasury.
Another debate followed, and it wÂ»s
finally decided to refer the original sec
tion and McCarthy's substitute to the
legislative committee for consideration.
Sachs moved that the section adopted
Turs.iay evening, providing that railroad
franchises be for only twenty-rive years
and that the tracks and roadbed then re
vert to the city, be reconsidered. He said
that if the section remained It would put
an end to railroad building, to the great
injury of outlying districts.
The board refused to reconsider its ac
tion, by an almost unanimous vote.
A section was then adopted providing
that ex-Mayors of the city and county
shall be entitled to seat? and a voice in
the deliberations of the Supervisors, but
not to a vote. The section is taken from
the charter of Greater New York.
The Freeholders will meet again Friday
afternoon.

be do doubt or the underlying strength and
breadth of to-day's market for securities
The Maine incident has. In fact, been convert
ed Into an actual bull factor in the stock
market, the exchange of courtesies at Havana
promising more towards
â moothing relations between the two court
..in anything that has yet occurred The
â  nta 01 i days market were broad and
deep, and left no room to doubt that large in
terests were absorbing securities with great
confidence, and on a very heavy scale Heavy
purchases of 1000 share blocks were freouent
In leading stocks and all through the list and
there were a number of transactions In bonds
In which $100,000 par value changed hands In
one block. Almost every group of railway
properties In the market was represented In
the advance.
The gToup of New York corporations waa an
exception and showed signs of heaviness
London continued a large factor, though its
purchases were probably not as large in this
market as was the case yesterday.
The exchange reflected the further effect
of its development with a sharp drop of % in
the actual rate for demand sterling, bringing
it down to $4 S4W. This Is the point which has
started the two last Import movements of gold
and there was talk In the street to-day of gold
Imports. This would be the more remarkable
In view of the hardening tendency of money
rates abroad and the continued ease here. The
loca* money market showed no effect from to
day s surrender by New York banks of the
first 10 per rent of the installment of the Gov
ernment d.-t runt of the I'nion Pa
ale. This transaction resulted in prac
tically wiping out the Sub-Treasury's debit
balance at Use clearing nouse to-day, which
has been running recently from over half a
million to nearly a million dollars a day.

stricted all stock markets here to-day, except
Americans, which rose steadily and closed
: quiet at the best, almost entirely on New York
support. New York Central and Ontario and
Western led the rise.
Other markets were featureless. Spanish se

ing still further and more was borrowed to-day
from the Bank of England. The East Indian

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. Jan. 26.â The opening In wheat
was firm. May starting at 94M ( @94 1 4c. an ad
! vance of %Â©%'â¢. while" July was %@%c higher
at 85@85%c. This partly due to the firmness
at Liverpool, where %d advance was shown.
The destruction of the East St. Louis ele
vator with 250.000 bushels wheat also had
some effect, as It was expected to cause buy
ing from there. The contrary proved to be the
case. New York reported good foreign de
mand with the May price up %c. Against this
was the big snowfall, and the bearlshness
: this caused was especially marked In July.
[ There were no signs of a renewal of the Leiter
' bidding for January, which ran the price of
that delivery up to {1 yesterday, but never
theless the sudden advance in prices which
: that maneuver caused yesterday" made the
bears rather timid, and each attack on May
was followed by â  a rally. Toward midday,
however, the market was allowed to sag.
! May had touched 93?Â£c and reacted to 94' 4 c
1 several times, but about 12 o'clock the price
! had gradually declined to 93 1 . 8 ,, c. The
â  fluctuations were . apparently the result of
j scalping, as no news of importance came In.
To-day's clearances from Atlantic ports
I were equal to 415,000 bushels. Liverpool closed
%d higher for futures; Paris from 5 centimes
to 10 centimes higher for wheat and flour
and Antwerp 12V4 centimes higher. '
About â¢ ten minutes from the close the pit
suddenly took on a scene of activity. January
had been practically nominal at about Â»6c all
day, but before the Leiter people got through
with it the price was $1 01. It closed at $1.
May responded to this rally much more readily
than It did yesterday. The market had been
; rather oversold anyway, and the Jump In
: January, coming Just after fresh war news In
| the shape of a report that a British gunboat
j had seized a steamer loaded with arms and
; ammunition In the gulf of Oman and con
signed to Russian houses, started shorts on a
hurried hunt for cover. ThÂ« top price was
reached on this bulge.
_ May closed decidedly strong at M" 4 p. July
had sold arf low as 84>*c early In the day. but
rallied and closed at 85Â«Â» c. â¢â¢
Not much was done in corn. May ranged
'Â«>Â«> Â»%gÂ»!Â»e Â° 29 '* C ' and closed %c higher
, Oats were very dull, but firm. May ranged
from 23*0240 and 23\@23!ic. and closed

BOSTON WOOL MARKET.
BOSTON, Jan. 26.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say of the wool trade to-.
: morrow: From outward appearances the mar- i
ket has been as quiet during the past week
as at any time. As a matter of fact, however,
there has been an enlargement In the trading
of more than 62 per cent, the sales amount- !
Ing to I. mm pounds, against 3.377,000 pounds
the preceding week. The amounts of wool |
Fold have ranged downward from about 600.000
pounds. There have been no excessive sales
by anybody, but a number of concerns, which
previously reported substantially no sales, j
nave done a moderate business. There have
been a few large mills In the market looking
for specialties, but the . demand has for the
most part been of a general character. Prices ,
are firmly maintained, and asking prices have ,
In some Instances been marked up materially. I
The attention of the market has been prin- '

Will Be No Cutting of Wages
in the San Francisco
Mint.
The Superintendent Anxious to Rest
After Thirty-Seven Years 1
Newspaper Work.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Jan. 26.
Hon. Frank A. Leach, Superintendent
of the San Francisco Mint, has re
turned from "Washington and says that
as a result of his visit to the Secretary
of the Treasury there will be no reduc
tion in the wages of the employes of
the Mint.
"The order reducing wages of the
employes in the Mint 25 per cent was
made of course in the name of the Sec
retary, but in all probability it was
suggested by subordinates. I knew that
the labor situation on the Coast and
the wages which obtained here were
not known at Washington and that all
that would be required was to bring
the situation here to the knowledge of
the S â  n tary of the Treasury.
"Mr. Hllborn is working hard on his
bill to get a public Federal building for
Oakland. He is putting forth every
effort to attain his object. There will
be opposition in the House on the score
of economy, but this will not deter Mr
Hilborn.
"I arrived in Washington in time to
do something for Judge McKenna, who
is an old p.-rsonal friend. The objec
tion to him was under consideration,
and I was able to say something to
Borne of the Senators about him. My
opinions as a newspaper man were of
great assistance in Indorsing what had
been said by other Californians. Allen
of Nebraska violently opposed Mc-
Kenna, but I believe did not vote
against him after all. Mr. Waymire
of Alameda is talked about at Wash
ington, but it was acknowledged that
nfter the President had placed Mr-
Kenna on the Supreme bench he could
not take another man from California
find put him into the Cabinet. Peo>
ho have talked with Mr. McKin
ley about Wayraire have an idea that
some office will be found for him."
Mr. Leu eh was asked concerning an
article in The Call, published this
morning, relating to the possible sale of
the Knquirer to people who were inter
ested In the gubernatorial situation,
and saying he was anxious to retire
from active newspaper work.
"About two months ago."' he said, "a
man named Williams came to me and
asked if the Enquirer was for sale. I
told him it was to any person who
would pay my pri^e. I learned after
iliat O. B. Daniels was interested
with him. and some time later when I
saw Dr. Pardee he said that he did not
think it likely they were trying to se
cure the paper in his interests, as he
knew nothing about it. I am tired of
politics and yet I shall take an interest
in them as a matter of public duty.
When a man has hwn in the newspa
per business for thirty-seven years, and
Is over fifty years of age. h>> feels as if
he would like to take a rest, and that
is the way I feel."
NUNAN'S WAR
TRUMP HEARD
He Shouts That There Is a
Plot in Democratic
Politics.
Prospects of Bed War in the Stnte
Central Committee Meet
ing.
There Is every promise that when
Chairman Alford's gavpl signals order at
the meeting of the Democratic State
Central Committee at the California Ho
tel on Saturday morning it will strike
fire an<3 that a regulation Democratic
row will promptly begin.
It is generally understood and expected
that thÂ» dropping from the roll of the
forty-two members who did not pay that
$30 campaign assessment will be insisted
upon by the representatives and friends
of the Sullivan Democracy. The issue
will be squarely presented on roll call.
and the engagement will open promptly.
The first note <>f thÂ« war trumpet has
been sounded by Colonel J. J. Nunan.
member of the committee and partner of
Harbor Commissioner Colnon In the
Stockton Mail. A long and vigorous cir
cular from him to the members of the
committee reached the local members
yesterday. He. jumps on the suspected
programme like a buck on a rattlesnake,
and appeals to the members to attend in
person.
The vigorous Democratic editor recites
the fact that the only official notice of
the meeting was en obscure, advertise
ment printed one time in the Examiner,
"a peculiar method." Notices Hent by
mail would have cost a total of $2 "o. "The
manner thus adopted in calling the meet
ing therefore naturally arouses suspi
cion."
"Rumors are Quito general," contin
ues the appeal, "that the purpose of the
meeting Is to drop from the roll of
membership forty-two members who it
Is said failed to pay the assessment
levied during the campaign of 1896. In
this connection it might be also proper
to say that those who apparently favor
this course seem very anxious to give
out the Impression that the most of
these forty-two members represent San
Francisco.
It is declared that but six of the
twenty-eight San Francisco members
are delinquent, leaving thirty or more of
the interior. Sir. Nunan wants to know
why country members should pay ass
essments anyway when they spend time
and money to attend meetings, while
San Francisco members board at home
and likely walk. It is shown to be an
unjust and undemocratic scheme. The
members are direct representatives of
the people, should not be removed ex
cept for grave cause and then vacancies
should be filled by county committees.
Why should forty-two be humiliated?
Then the Colonel sounds the key note of
the issue: \
"The proceeding savors of some plot.
"Is It possible that the wires are being
pulled in an - effort to control 'tin
works,' and capture the Democratic
State Central Committee?
"A shrewd and cunning diplomat is at
work, under cover, and possibly several
shrewd, cunning 1 diplomats jointly are
in a combination."
Then there is this analysis: There are
10S members representing the people and
elected at congressional and county con
ventions, and twenty-one at largo named
by the chairman. Removing forty-two
leaves eighty-seven members, and twen
ty-three members representing the voters
The Perfume of Violets I
The purity of the lily, the glow of the rose./
and the flush of Hebe combine ia Pozzotii'mi
wondrous Powder. r
and the twenty-one appointed by the
chairman would give a majority which
would elect forty-two new members.
"Every Indication points to an effort
being made to control the State Central
Committee, and the parties engaged In ]
the attempt realize possibly that such j
control is impossible with the membership
existing. Therefore the necessity to make
removals in order to further "their am- :
bition."
It is on these lines that a lot of big j
Democrats nre stirring their boots, and it
is on these lines that the forces are lining
up. There may lie a governorship at
stake and there may be the local machine ,
at stake.
Uses Foul Language.
Alexander Campbell, a young man j
ahout 25 years of age, was sentenced by
Judge Conlan yesterday to pay a fine of j
$100. with the alternative of 100 days in
the County Jail, for using vulgar lan- ;
puape to a young man and a young lady j
on Monday. The Judge said that Camp
bell had the foulest mouth of any human
t.-Mng he had ever seen. The defend
ant's father, who is a physician in the
Mission, had him arrested some time ago
and banished him from his hnrae owing
to his foul language and bad conduct.
RESULT OF A
CONFESSION
F. C. Kretzer Charged With
Murder by the
Police.
He Threw a Brick at Charles C-
Koelling With Fatal
Effect.
Frank C. Kretzer was formally
charged with murder at the City Pris
on yesterday by Detectives Dillon and
Reynolds who have been for some days
working on the case.
When Kretzer was arrested in Val
lejo on a warrant charging him with
burglary in Fresno he confessed, as was
then stated exclusively in The Call.
that he had murdered Charles C. Koel
ling in this city on May 30, 1895. It
was thought at first that Kretzer was
simply "bluffing" to escape being ta
ken to Fresno, but subsequent develop
ments showed that he was telling the
truth.
The detectives found an Important
witness yesterday. Seldon Orchard, a
bricklayer, was foreman at the time
for Koelling. He stated yesterday that
he remembered Kretzer and three or
four other men coming to 943 Folsom
street, where Koelling and his men
were building an oven. Kretzer be
gan to criticize the men's work and
called them 'scabs." Koelling ordered
him away, but he refused. Koelling
then attempted to eject him, but failed.
Koelling went to the Southern police
station and made a complaint against
Kretzer, but was told to swear to a
warrant for his arrest in the Police
Court.
Koelling returned to the building and
Kretzer and his friends had gone.
; About an hor- later, when the men
; were knocking off work, Kretzer re
turned, and seizing a brick threw it at
I Koelling. It struck him on the head.
i knocking him down. Kr.tzer ran home
! and remained in hiding for a few days
till he learned that Koelling had died.
; He left the city and went to Vacaville.
i Detective Dan Coffey went there after
him, but some of his friends gave him
i the tip and he skipped out for Suisun.
i From Suisun he went to Woodland,
then to Sacramento and finally settled
in Fresno, where he is wanted for
burglary.
The police Mill also have the evl
j dence of Dr. Kuegler who attended
: Koelling, and of Killing's widow who
i is at present housekeeper at the Golden
i West Hotel. Besides these there will
|be the witnesses who testified at the
| Coroner's inquest.
AN UNSEEN COMMANDER.
The superstitions of the men who go down to thp sea In ships have
been made the subject for the humor of all of the laughter-loving
portion of the civilized world. Yet those whose vocations or roving
instincts have made them the companions and confidants of sailors
know that the sea is replete with well authenticated stories of ac
tual occurrences which cannot be explained by any natural law or un
derstood by any course of logical reasoning.
A few years ago there lived in a cozy little rose-embowered cot
tage on the outskirts of Oakland an old retired naval captain, who,
when he was a young lieutenant attached to the European squadron',
had an experience which was, to say the least, rather extraordinary!
The vessel on which he was serving at the time of the Incident In
the capacity of navigating officer, was bound up the Mediterranean to
investigate the report of an insult to the American flag, which floated
over one of America's consulates in that part of the globe.
Four bells struck and the lieutenant left the wardroom, where he
had been sitting, listening to the customary Saturday night yarns of
sweethearts and wives, to take the second dog watch. On arriving on
deck he found the weather exceptionally fine and the vessel moving
briskly along with everything set and the yards slightly braced to
catch the gentle breeze which was fanning them from a few points
abaft the beam.
Everything pointed to a pleasant watch and a quiet "all night in"
when his* short two hours should come to an end. Not a cloud was
In the sky to dim the luster of the new moon shining down from its
setting In the heavens, and dimming with its refulgence the splendor
of the stars until they appeared but tiny specks of light In the grad
ually deepening canopy of purple. The men were gathered In groups
forward playing games, singing songs, telling stories or sitting idly
by and watching the antics of the ship's boys who were playing mon
key tricks and skylarking with one another; while the occasional note
of a guitar or refrain of a song floating up from below, reminded
those above that the wardroom was taking Its share of the license
allowed during a Saturday night dog watch.
Suddenly, as the officer was pacing the deck, his quiet was dis
turbed by a voice which seemed to come from directly behind him
and which said, "Take in sail." He turned quickly, but seeing no one
there, put the matter down to imagination and resumed his walk. A
few minutes elapsed when again he heard the command, "Take in
sail." This time he knew tbjit his fancy had not played him a trick
but. though he looked carefully around the broad expanÃe of deck, he
could see no one near enough to have thus addressed him. An uncanny
feeling began to steal over him and a premonition of coming evil
forced itself upon him against his will.
While still in this nervous state of uncertain expectancy he again
heard the voice, this time directly at his side, and in a tone so loud
as to put all doubt to flight, "Take in everything at once or it will be
too late."
The now thoroughly frightened officer hesitated no longer; and
though It is against the naval regulations for a subordinate to do any
thing more than slightly shorten sail without notifying his command
er, he sprang to the break of the poop and sang out, "Forward
there! Topgallant and royal halyards; man clewlines and buntlines
stand by jib-halyards and down hauls. All the watch to take in sail."
With the strict discipline that has made our navy the finest in the
world, the men sprang to obey the unexpected order. Jibs came rat
tling down and square sails were clewed up as though by magic; and
at the command of the shrill piping whistles, the t'gallant and royal
yard men sprang aloft to make everything snug.
But hardly had they got Into the tops when the order came for
them to lay down again and the last hardly reached the deck when one
of the terrific hurricanes common* to those latitudes broke out of the
clear sky.
It taught the ship right abeam and keeled her over until her
lee rail was buried out of sight, and the water raced aft as high as the
combings of the hatches, in a hissing, seething, boiling flood.
With an effort the ship righted herself and for the two succeed
ing days rode out one of the worst gales that it was ever her lot to
encounter.
Had not the officer obeyed the command of the unseen voice, the
ship, with the canvas she was carrying, would have been capsized by
the force of the blow so suddenly that not one of her complement
would have lived to tell the tale.
When the facts of the above story were told to the writer, a few
years ago, by the officer himself, the old gentleman, on concluding hiÃ
narration, said: "I tell you this story, my boy, because last night I
heard the same voice say "that my watch was ended and 'twas time
to pipe below." The next afternoon he was found dead in his chair.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 27, 1898.
IN THE REALTY
BROKERS'REALM
Dealers Encouraged by
Good Inquiry During
the Week.
"Inside" Property Has the
Upper Hand, While Country
Lands Go Slowly.
Only Small Sales Reported of Late.
Record Review, Auctions and
Random Notes.
When real estate prices are low there
always seems a disposition on the part
of intending purchasers to hold aloof
and wait until the market has reached
bedrock, in which cheerless state it has
been for many moons. But when the
tide turns buyers rush, helter-skelter,
to purchase before the change for the
better becomes very marked.
Dealers predict that the turning point
is here, evidenced by better sales, bet
ter inquiry and a far better outlook.
Inquiry, showing as it does that sales
will soon follow, has been especially
good for the past week. The market,
however, is practically only for "in
side" lands as yet. Country lands go
slowly, and generally sales are for
large tracts.
It is confidently expected that the
present Klondike excitement will con
tribute its quota to help the scales
lower on the side of prosperity in the
realty line. Several large sales may be
reported by next week.

Little Matter Set Right.
OAKLAND. Jan. 26.â Jamea Stewart
called at the District Attorney's office
to-day to tell of a financial trouble he
had had with Rev. Edwards Davis. Mr
Stewart said he came to Oakland with
his family partly on the representations
of Rev. Mr. Davis, with whose church he
united on his arrival. Soon after coming
to Oakland Stewart told Davis that he
had $100 In cash, and the minister ad
vised him to deposit it In a bank.
After this transaction an arrangement
was made by which Davis took the bank
receipt and gave Stewart a promissory
note, and when the latter called at the
bank the note was not honored. He then
went to Mr. Davis, told him the situation
and the minister paid him $70 on thf note
When tho circumstances were explained
to Mr. Melvln he said that the payment
of the $70 would act an a compromise in
the proceeding, and that the balance
might lÂ»e collected by civil suit. Mr. Mel
vln. however, will wrltf to the minister
and advise him that the balance should
be paid.

MANAGER BROWN
BECOMES BOLD
Openly Attacks the Athletics
Committee of the
Faculty.
Declares That They Are Not Work
ing for thÂ« Interests of Uni
versity Athletics.
BERKELEY, Jan. 26.â Everett J. Brown
was to-day- unanimously re-elected foot
ball manager for the season of IS9S. In
his speech of acceptance Brown vigor
ously roasted the athletics committee of
the faculty as at present constituted.
Professors Bacon, Clapp and Edwards
ar>- tae members of the^commlttee which
Brown declares is not acting in the Inter
ests of athletics nor trying to benefit true
sport. There is a growing sentiment at
the university In favor of reconstructing
the committee, with Professors Edwards.
Magee and Cloman as members. Presi
dent Kellogg will probably soon be re
qoested to make the change.
There has been considerable friction be
tween Brown as football manager and
Professors Bacon and Clapp. Brown's
recent attack on Yale m'en and Tata
methods was supposed to have been
aimed at Clapp and P.acon, both of whom
are Yale alumni.
CAPTAIN HEALEY'S FUNERAL.
Last Tribute of Respect to the
Popular Officer.
The funeral of the late Captain H. S.
Healey, clerk to the Police Commission
ers, was held from his residence. Fif
teenth and Mission streets, to Cypress
Lawn Cemetery yesterday afternoon.
The servi.es at tho residence and at the
prave were conducted by Rev. Dr. Rader.
The Police Choral Society sang. "Still.
Still With Thee," and "Lo, the Seal of
Death Is Breaking," at the house, and
brought tears to the eyes of many of the
mourners by the pathetic manner in
which they were rendered.
Three companies, under the command
respectively of Captains Wlttman, Spil
lane and Gillen, acted as an escort, and
among those at the funeral were Chief
Lees, ex-Chief Crowley, Auditor Brod
erlck and Police Commissioner GunÂ«t.
There were a large number of beautiful
and costly floral offerings. The pall-bear
ers were: Sergeants Donovan, M. O. An
derson and G. B. Baldwin; Policemen T.
<\ Murphy, O. B. Merrick. O. C. Phillips.
S. Orr, R. Graham and J. L. Murphy, and
Detective Harry Reynolds.
The Police Commissioners met last
night, but Immediately adjourned out of
respect to the memory of Captain Healey.
HIGH SCHOOL MATTERS.
Proposition to Be Made to Bond
thje City for $75,000 to Pay
for a New Building.
ALAMEDA, Jan. 2fi.â A Joint meeting of
the Board of Education and the special
committee of thirteen appointed to de
vise ways and means for relieving the
overcrowded condition of the public
schools was held last evening. President
Scott of the board addressed the gather
ing. He favored a new High School
building, and said that the proposition
was to have a bond issue of $75,000, of
which $60,000 would be expended in the
new building. $10,000 for a lot for it and
the remainder for fixtures and improve
ments upon the old structures. The mat
ter was gone into at considerable length
and Suprintendent Sullivan went into de
tail to show the reasons why a new build
ing of the kind proposed for the accom
modation of the High School was de
sirable.
It was finally decided that the commit
tee should be given an object lesson upon
the condition of the department, and it
was planned that they should visit the
various schools and see for themselves
their needs. This will be done on Satur
day next, and the committee will meet
again next Tuesday evening.
City Trustees' Meeting.
ALAMEDA. Jan. 2G.â The Board of City
Trustees met In committee of the whole
last evening to dismiss various matters of
public interest. Tho question of widening
Railroad avenue to conform with the
grade throughout was taken up. and It
was conceded that something should be
done, but no plan was formulated. The
proponed change in the making of requi
sitions and the purchase and delivery of
supplies came up. and it was found that
the system was already In operation In
some of the departments, while In others
the Trustees had no control. The fact
developed that no change could be made
unless it were brought about by the
Treasurer refusing to fash warrants on
tho ground thnt due precaution had not
been used !n making them out. It is
probable that something of this kind will
be done and that thr> safeguards In use
in banks with a similar object will he
adopted in the city's business to prevent
forgery and raising of warrants, as has
been the done in tho rase of the library.
Incidentally it was decided that the li
brary books should be experted during
the period that Mr. Harbourne was libra
rlan.
MURDER AT TRACEY
TRACET, Jan. 27.â Thomas Gaffery
was shot and seemingly mortally j
wounded by Joseph Byrnes in the for- ;
mer's saloon at 1:30 o'clock. Five stots
were fired, three taking effect, one in
either arm and one below the heart. At
this hour he is still alive, but the doc- <
tor's say he cannot survive. Byrnea
has gone to Stockton to give himself
up. Both are old residents.
John Noonan. 654 Oak street, reported
to the police yesterday that his house was
entered by burglars a few nights ago and
about $2uo worth of articles stolen. En- i
trance was effected by forcing open one
of the back windows.

"ladles' day," drew a large crowd to
Ingleside yesterday. To those who de
light in playing outsiders it was a most
enervating day's sport. Two favorites,
Zamar and The Bachelor, scored, but
the four other choices were carried to
their corners hopelessly beaten.
The racing was well contested
throughout, the finish to the second
event being one of the most exciting of
the season. In the way of riding honors,
Conley carried off the palm by piloting
two winners, one a favorite, the other
an outsider.
The steeplechase over the new "man
slaughter" course was replete with In
cidents and accidents. The favorite,
Reno, fell early in the game, severely
Injuring his rider, Barry, who was car
ried off the field in an unconscious
etate. Then the second choice, Presi
dio, ridden by the athletic George
Cochran, ran out at the fourth jump,
putting him out of business and burn-
Ing up a raft of coin. After this. Lord
Chesterfield, a highly touted beginner
over the sticks, assumed command and
â¢won as he pleased. "Stew" Peters suc
ceeded in finishing intact, and took the
place with Mestor. Una Colorado, after
a most tempestuous passage, landed in
the show. The course is a great boon
to the medical profession.
Little Gray distinguished himself by
a piece of rare good riding in the six
furlong run, second on the programme,
lie had the mount on Daily Racing
Form, a 6-to-l chance in the betting,
and six horses passed the wire so close
ly bunched that it was almost impossi
ble to pick the winner. Daily Racine:
Form gained the verdict by a nose, with
the fast coming Benarrela a nose in
front <>f Hermosa. Novia, Olenower
and Valencienne were but heads fur
ther away.
A very cheap class of platers went to
the post in the opening seven-furlong
run. with Ciaudiana ruling favorit" In
the betting. Cash Sloan, who had the
leg up, was unfortunate in getting
pocketed and was led out by Sardou, a
7 to 1 chance, ridden by Conley. Ra
fa^la secured show honors in a drivp.
Zamar is back in his old winning
form and took the six-furlong sprint,
third on the card, in tho gamest possi
ble fashion from Mainstay. Ho wns
r 3 to 2 choice at post time and getting
away well to a ragged start fought it
out the entire distance with Hughey
Jones' big chestnut, winning driving
by a npok. In a punishing finish. High
lrnd Ball led Hartly out for the show.
Tho start ruined the chances of Mid
light. Morinel fell at the post.
The victory of The Bachelor In the
mile and a quarter selling affair was
probably due to the splendid riding of
Willie Martin. After Our Climate and
Tulare had pet a merry clip for a mile,
Martin made his move with the Corri
gan entry and with little to sparo at
the end downed Tulare a head in 2:05 1 4.
Our Climate tired the last quarter, fin
ishing third. The winner was an even
money favorite.
Don Clarpncio ran for the first time
In the colors of Kittleman Brothers in
thÂ» last event, OVw one mile and a
furlong, decided under selling condi
tions, and overturned a very warm fa
vorite in Oorrigan's Can't Dance. The
latter was a 1 to 2 choice in the betting
nnd in a run )n which no pace was sot
the Don lpd the favorite out a length
â¢with the juicy price of 12 to 1 against

TRACK ITEWS
While being schooled over the steeplechase
course after the fencing event, Volt fell at
one of the Jumps with Maynard, breaking a
rib or two for that Impetuous rider.
Barry; the rider of Reno, had his tongue ,
nearly severed In half when that Jumper fell '
with him. and was otherwise badly bruised.
Lord Chesterfield was raced as a two-year
old by the firm of Burns & Waterhouee. Ha
was a pronounced failure, but appears to be
a regular kangaroo at the fen â '. gome. j
Judge Murphy says the Jumping horse riders j
have got him guessing. Hundreds of others
are in the same predicament.
As a yearling Sardou. winner of the first
race, cost Marcus Daly over $$000.

THE SAX rBAyCISCO CALL, THFRSDAY, JANUARY 27, 1898.
RYAN AND GREEN
MAY BE MATCHED
; A Permit From the Supervisors
the Only Obstacle In
the Way.
i ; '
i National Club Men Snngulna of Se
curing the Battleâ The Wires
Kept Hot.
â¢
For some time the National Club has
been making endeavors to match George
Green with Tommy Ryan, the famous
welter-weight, and affairs have ' now
reached a pass where practically all
that stands in the way of ultimate suc
cess Is the reluctance of the Board of Su
i pervisors In granting permits for boxing
contests.
Ryan has been wired several times In
regard to the proposed match, and has
signified his willingness to meet Green,
provided satisfactory articles of agree
ment can be decided upon. Manager
Groom telegraphed him Monday that the
club would give 60 per cent of the gross
receipts, the purse to be divided accord-
Ing to the will of the fighters themselves.
Up to a late hour last evening no an
swer had been received, but one is ex
pected to-day. It is believed that the
Syracuse pugilist will accede to these
terms and will start for this city as soon
as he learns definitely that the club can
secure a permit.
Messrs. Gtbbs and Groom are confident
that the board will grant them a permit
for February, and if their hopes are
realized the fight will take place, other
arrangements being settled, in the lat
ter part of next month, presumably on
the 24th. Green is perfectly willing to
agree to the terms mentioned and pre
fers to fight at catch weights. There can
be no doubt that Ryan will prefer catch
weights himself, and if the Supervisors
recover from their attack of the marble
heart in time lovers of the. ring may ex
pect to see a clever battle.

THIEVES
LAUGH AT
THE LAW
Commit Depredations
Under the Noses of
the Police.
City Hall Officials Cannot!
Protect Their Own
Property.
John Holland, a Southern Pat- |
rol Wagon Driver, the
Latest Victim.
ROGUES ROB A RESIDENCE
They Get Away With Five Hundred
Dollars' Worth of
Jewelry.
Glaring instances are being brought
to light tending to show that the crim
inal element is growing bolder with the
winter season. The police attribute this
apparent defiance of the law to the in
flux of strangers attracted by the Jubi
lee and are confident that they can keep
evil doers in check.
Nevertheless a daring burglar, whose
Identity is unknown, last night visited
the City Hall and, breaking open a
locker in which was stored the cloth
ing of the patrol- wag' m drivers, got
away uith a $50 overcoat belonging to
John Holland, who drives the Southern
Station wagon. The lockers, which are
used by the patrol-wagon drivers, are
situated opposite the Southern Station
and are under the very noses of the
police.
Shortly after 6 o'clock last evening
Holland was sent on a run, and when
he returned a short time afterward he
was surprised to find that his locker
had been broken open and his valuable
overcoat taken. A young man was
seen leaving the hall with something
bulky under his coat, and it is supposed
that he was the thief. Several weeks
ago the same locker was forced open,
and an overcoat an<J a hat belonging
to another driver was stolen.
As if to furnish another instance of
the prevalence of this species of crime
C. M. Converse, who lives at 1431 Oak
Btreet, reported to the police last night
that burglars entered the house last
Monday afternoon and stole a miscella
neous assortment of Jewelry, valued at
$." The family were absent at the
time, having left the house to view the
parade. "When they r* turned several
hours later they were surprised to find
one of the panels in the front door
broken. A large cobble-stone was ly
ing on the front Btoop, and judging
from the ragged hole in the door Mr.
Converse is convinced that the burglars
broke the panel with the stone. They
then reached in and unlocked the door.
After gaining an entrance the burg
lars forced open bureau-drawers and
closets and even cut open several mat
tresses, so determined were they not
to overlook anything of value. Mr.
Converse has furnished the police with
a description of the stolen property,
and every effort is being made to ap
prehend the burglars.
r>n the same day an attempt was
made to enter a residence at 1427 Gol
den Gate avenue, but the burglars were
frightened <-ff by a servant.
LATEST MOVE OF
REV. C. O. BROWN
He Will Speak in Metropolitan
Temple Next Sunday
Evening.
The Star Sensationalist Not Yet Ready
to Retire From Public
Gaze.
The Rev. C. O. Brown, who has never
been known to do anything that was
not sensational, is now about to make
his appearance before the public In a
new role. Last Monday evening he
created a sensation by appearing be
fore the Bay Conference with a con
fession â or, as he termed it, an admis
sion that a portion of the charges
against him was well founded, and
appealed for mercy. The mercy was
not gTanted, however, and the impres
sion went abroad that he would quietly
make his bow and disappear from the
public stage.
But those who made that guess are
entitled to "a few more thinks," as re
tiring to a life of obscurity or even
leaving the city without making
a public appearance is appar
rently about the last thing Dr.
Brown would think of doing, and
he now publicly announces his inten
tion of appearing at Metropolitan Hall
on Sunday evening next, at which time
and place he will make another
confession â not to a select assemblage
of pastors, but to any and all comers.
When interviewed by a Call repre
sentative yesterday Dr. Brown spoke
as follows:
"I shall speak next Sunday evening
NEW TO-DAY.

ITCHING HUMORS XSLSSJf
in Metropolitan Hall at 8 o'clock by the
invitation and advice of many people.
My theme will be the "Wages of Sin."
It is not my expectation to find any
condition of things that will flatter
human pride. I came to this city to do
an unpleasant duty, and a portion of
that duty I owe to the whole com
munity."
"What do you think of the interviews
that appeared in the several morning
papers this morning with reference to
your public acknowledgment?"
"I am extremely gratified, as in the
nature of things I would be, that the
most prominent members of the Green
street church can feel so kindly toward
me under these trying circumstances.
Mr. and Mrs. Stone and Mr. and Mrs.
Hanson are among the leading mem
bers of my Chicago church. When I
came to San Francisco I fully expect
ed to go away from this city without a
friend. On the contrary, I have been
met with the greatest cordiality, and
men who have opposed me m<>st
strenuously have invited me to their
homes and I have availed myself and
shall avail myself of those invitations.
"What calling do you expect to pur
sue hereafter?"
"It is impossible for me at present to
say. I am as much in the dark on
that subject as you are. I <!o not know
where I shall find work nor what the
work will be. Of course I must find
something soon, because my moans are
reduced. 1 am willing to do anything
that is honorable for the support of
my family."
There was a division of opinion at
the meeting of the Bay Conference at
which Dr. Brown was expelled from
membership, and the opposing factions
nre contending as to whether he shal!
be expelled from the ministry or be re
instated in case he should show a spirit
of true Christian repentance. The ver
dict simply excludes him from affilia
tion with the churches of this coast.
The Ecclesiastical Council <Â»f Chicago
which has accepted Dr. Brown into its
fold is the only body that can Rive the
decree of expulsion and it now lies with
that organization to decide whether he
shall be received back into the folds it
made an outcast.
SEWED HIS LIP TO HIS NOSE.
Some Startling Experiments in the State of Self-Induced Hypnotism,
Professor P. A. Bernard of Dcs Moines, lowa, clearly demonstrated to the mind of evrry person present at
the San Francisco College of Buggestlve Therapeutics last evening that the administration of an anesthetic for
the performing of a MirglcaJ operation is totally unnecessary. He did this by throwing himself into a self-induced
state of hypnosis, thus producing anesthesia, and submitting to such surgical tests as completely removed all
doubts as to his utter lack of any feeling -while in that state. Professor Bernard was assisted in his exhibitions
by Drs. D. McMillan ami Bemple Turm.in of the college.
The occasion was the formal opening of the fourth course of demonstrations in hypnotism. ProfesÃor
Bernard lias only recently come to San Francisco, He is connected with the college in the Instruction of trained
occultism, which Is an exemplification of the work of Eastern adeptship. Under this head is included the whole
range of pyscbologlcal, physiological, cosmlcal, physical and spiritual phenomena. ' The exhibition was the first
of its kind evt-r given in Ban Francisco or west of Denver. In the exhibition of scientific hypnotism Professor
Bernard was assisted by E. Mansfield Williams, who acted as his subject in his various tests. Mr. Williams
is a professional subject of world-wide fame, having worked for such famous hypnotists as Demonco of Paris,
Temple of Now York, Gregowictz of Russia, Palmer of London and Albert of Bombay, India. Professor Ber
nard himself has been associated with Burns and Gribble, Johnstone and Hamati of Beyruth, Syria, in Turkish
Asia.
Before beginning his exhibition of self-induced hypnosis Professor Bernard said that he was willing to submit
to any test that was within the bounds of human reason, and that could be found in any book on hypnotism
He also stated that he was the only man in this country that could of his own will produce upon himself a
state of anesthesia. Speaking of the occult sciences he said that In many of Its branches It was unlawful for an
adept to practice all the inner mysteries of the human mind that were within his knowledge.
Professor Bernard then sat In a chair and composed himself. In a short time he was asleep Dr McMillan
then took a needle and thread and sewed his ear to his cheek. He next sewed his upper lip to his nose and then
he pulled his tongue out and ran a large hat pin through It. Those present were permitted to examine the test
most closely. After the pin and threads had been removed Professor Bernard awoke. For a few moments he
appeared dazed, but he was soon himself. The towel that he had placed around his neck was saturated with
blood, but he declared that he felt no pain or soreness in his face. This sleep on the part of Professor Bernard
was purely voluntary and self-induced.
Next followed his own experiments upon his subject. They were truly wonderful v an exhibition of scientific
hypnotism. In producing Bleep upon his own subject Professor Bernard uses the telepathic rather than the phy
sical suggestion. He operates quickly and smoothly. Every one present was thoroughly convinced of the genu
ineness of every thing witnessed.
j There is an element in the Bay Con
ference that believes that Dr. Brown
having confessed and professed repent
ance is entitled to be received back into
the fold, and certain strong friends of
his are now working in that direction.
Had the matter come to a vote of the
j individual members on Monday evening
it is probable that the decree of expul
sion would not have been recorded
â  against him.
The action of the majority in voting
j that his fate be placed in the hands of
a committee changed the trend of af
fairs and made the final decision a mat
; ter for future consideration.
The Japanese forger.
An application was made to Judge Mor
row yesterday for a writ of habeas cor
pus on behalf of the Japanese Oyama
Kenichi. who was arrested on his arrival
here on a cablegram from England on
the request of the Japanese Government,
Kenichi being charged with having ob
tained 15,000 yen by means of forgery.
The writ was ordered issued, returnable
to-morrow. The application for the writ
set forth that the complaint on which h<
was arrested does not show a suffi
cient state of facts to show that an of
fense agalnsi the .aws of Japan had
been committed.

PISHING THE
RAILROAD
IN ASIA
Progress of Work on
the Great Russian-
Siberian Line.
Pending Completion of the
Road the Amoor River
Is Available.
Vladivostok Is Destined to Be
come the Commercial Me
tropolis of Eastern Asia.
TRADE WITH THIS CITY.
Russia Can Now Move Troops Across
the Continent From Mo6cow to
the Pacific Ocean.
Russell L. Dunn, a mining engineer,
who has traveled extensively in Siberia
as the representative of a mining syn
dicate in France, arrived from the Ori-
TORTURED WHILE ASLEEP.
ent day before yesterday on the steam
ship Coptic. Mr. Dunn left Vladivo
stok recently, but when asked yester
day concerning the number of Rus
sian troops at that garrison replied:
"1 did not try to ascertain the num
ber, and If I knew I would not say
anything about my knowledge of the
strength of the garrison as I expect to
return to Russia. Vladivostok is a
fine city of 30,000 inhabitants and is
rapidly growing. The improvements
are of fine character and the merchants
are enterprising and prosperous. It is
sure to become a great commercial me
tropolis and the leading city of East
ern Russia. There is no reason why
a large trade between San Francisco
and Vladivostok should not be devel
oped. The ice there obstructs naviga
tion somewhat in the winter, but with
the aid of ice-crushing boats the har
bor can be kept open all the year
round. TVe came out with an ice
crusher."
"Yes, Russia is the dominant power
in the Orient to-day," remarked Mr.
Dunn in response to questions on that
line. "At first glance it seems that
Russia will Russianize China, but the
result may be that China will Mongol-
Ize Russia, The Chinese merchants in
Vladivostok are influential and suc
cessful. Russia is powerful in Man
churia and Korea, and power once
gained by Russia Is never relin
quished."
Mr. Dunn gives an interesting ac
count of the progress it work in the
building of the great Russian Siberian
railroad to connect St. Petersburg and
Vladivostok. It is his belief that the
work on the main line cannot be com
pleted in 1900, but a rail and water
route will be opened for traffic across
the continent or Asia before that yeai
comes. Chelalisk, in the valley of the
eastern slope of the Ural Mountains, is
practically the initial point of the
Trans-Siberian Railroad. The line
which connects that point with St.
Petersburg and Moscow was finished
some years ago. From Che'.alisk east
the road is completed and in operation
to Nijni Ydinsk, a point about 350 miles
from Irkutsk. Much of the track on
the extension to Irkutsk is laid. In
order to complete the main line from
Irkutsk to Vladivostok it will be ne
cessary to build nearly two thousand
miles of railway. In going from St.
Petersburg to a point near Irkutsk. Mr.
Dunn was eleven days in the railway
car. He said of the Journey: "We
were going all the time, night and day.
and we seemed to be going at a fair
rate of speed, but I was eleven days on
the rail."
The railroad now in operation from
Vladivostok 660 miles north to the
Amoor River is not part of the main
line of the Russian Siberian Railroad,
but it is the only available route now
for travel between Vladivostok and
Russia and Europe.
The traveler (leaving Vladivostok for
St. Petersburg or Moscow goes by rail
north for 660 miles and there connects
with steamer on the Amoor River. The
river is one of the largest in the world,
being navigable 1500 miles above the
point where the railroad strikes the
stream. The head of navigation is a
place called Strelinsk, distant TOO miles
from Irkutsk. A vast deal of heavy
work has been done in building a rail
road from the head of navigation on
the Amoor across mountains to Ir
kutsk. American methods of construc
tion are employed. By decree of the
Czar ail the rails used are of Russian
manufacture. Many of the locomo
tives in use are of American make.
Perhaps within a year the railway
will be completed from the head of
navigation on the Amoor to Irkutsk,
and at the latter place connect with the
main line of the Russian Siberian Rail
way. As the main line is extended
eastward from Irkutsk and westward
from Vladivostok connection will be
made with a road building: in Manchu
ria to connect Port Arthur with the
Russian system of roads.
Troops can now be moved in small
detachments across the continent from
Russia in Europe to the Pacific Ocean.
The Amoor River is open from April
to September. The stream carries such
a large volume of water that there is
no hindrance to navigation during the
open months of the year. As the gap
is being closed rapidly between Irkutsk
and the head of the river navigation on
the Amoor the marching distance is
being correspondingly lessened. Rus
sia will soon be in position to move
large bodies of troops from Moscow
and St. Petersburg to vulnerable places

WINE MEN
DISAGREE
They Threaten aCut-Rate
War in California
Wines.
Redundant Vintage of Last Year
Is the Cause of the
Dispute.
President Crocker of the Winemakers'
Corporation Talks About
the Trouble.
An overflooded wine market has been
the cause of much discussion and no
end of dissension between the mer
chants and the producers of the State
and is responsible for the rumor that
wine would be hereafter placed on the
market at a reduction of 4 cents on the
gallon.
That wines have depreciated in value
since the redundant crops of the 1897
vintage were thrown on the market is
acknowledged by every merchant in
the city, but not one will acknowledge
that the trouble now at issue between
the California Wine Association and
the California Wine Makers' Corpora
tion relative to a reduction of the price
of wine has been prompted by a spirit
of animosity, but all say it is a natural
decline in the value of wine which
compels the former association to de
mand a reduction from the producers.
This they have refused to give and de
clare that if necessary they will go to
war with the association in order to
preserve the present standard of prices,
which range from 13 to 15 cents per
gallon.
Henry S. Crocker, president of the
Wine Makers' Corporation, expressed
his views and gave his opinion and so
lution of the present difficulty as fol
lows:
"The corporation of which I am the
president and representative head is
organized for the purpose of disposing
of the products of California wine pro
ducers without a middleman profit
and solely to the advantage of these
producers.
"Whether the wine merchants or the
California Wine Association think they
are in the right when they stoop to the
absurd folly of endeavoring to cause a
reduction in the price of wines mat
ters little to the corporation, because
such a reduction cannot possibly affect
the producers enrolled in its member-
ship.
"Such men as Percy T. Morgan of the
California Wine Association and Mr.
Jacoby of the firm of Lachman & Ja
coby and a few others arrogate to
themselves the fact that they control
the wine output of the State and can
therefore dictate to the producers the
price that shall be placed on the pro
duction of their vineyards.
"I have no personal enmity against
the individual wine merchants of the
city or the members of the California
Wine Association," said Mr. Crocker,
"but still as the representative and
president of the Makers* Corporation I
think my position demands that I
should say something in defense of the
producers' interests by taking a firm
stand apainst their oppressors."
Although Mr. Crocker expresses in
difference as to the movements of the
(Balifornia Wine Association and their
endeavor to cut prices of wine, he nev
ertheless exhibits considerable appre
hension as to whether these merchants
intend to institute the threatened rate
war. His characterization of the in
dividual members of the California
Wine Association and his pungent re
marks in the allusion to the association
as a whole indicate plainly that he
places some credence in the reports of
a contemplated reduction, and, also,
that the California Wine Association is
a power in the community.
"It seems absurd that an organization
which in my estimation is depreciating
in financial resources daily should pre
sume to dictate to the wine producers
of this State the proper price at which

"That this organization is on the
downward path can readily be seen by
observant men in this business; and
this little passing: episode of Mrs. Koh
i ler's insolvency is sufficient proof that
! things in this association are not what
j they should be.
"I believe this woman has been either
bunkoed into accepting stock, the
j value of which was exaggerated, or
j that the association since Mrs. Kohler
I joined it has been steadily on the de
j cline."
"When Mrs. Kohler joined this asso
1 ciation," he continued, "she was told
that in exchange for the plant and
, stock of the firm of Kohler & Frohling
'she was to receive 40.000 shares in the
new organization which represented,
she was told, $100 a sharÂ», par value.
She is now informed that her entire in- ,
terest in the association amounts to !
but $150,000. and I doubt whether she
could realize this sum in case of the
; disposal of her entire stock.
"Despite this enormous deprecia-
I tion in the value of the stock the man-
agers presume to dictate prices to pro
ducers, threatening them with boycott
unless they comply with their orders.
"This is the most absurd specimen of
business tact I ever heard of," said
Mr. Crocker, "and I think the origina
tors of the 4-cent reduction are
fools."
And thus the merry war goes on, and
it is a matter of conjecture at present
who will win out in thr> end. as the
California Wine Makers' Corporation
avers that it is in the right, and the
wine association people will not admit
that they are in the wrong.
As it is an inevitable and indisputa
ble fact that when two factions wage
war and wrangle over the same bone, a
I third party is going to be the gainer by
| their dispute, the point at issue just
at present is, who is going to derive the
benefit of this dispute and carry off the
bone of contention? Sympathy seems
to be on the side of the producer.
