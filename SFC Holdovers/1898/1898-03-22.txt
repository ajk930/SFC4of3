VOLUME LXXXIII.â XO. 112.
THE PRESIDENT
LOOKS FOR PEACE
WITH SLIGHT HOPE
Assured by Leaders in Congress
That He Will Not Be Embar
rassed by the Hot
Heads.
NEW YORK, March 21.â A Wash
ington special to the Herald says:
Nothing short of reparation for the
Maine disaster and the termination of
(\ Spanish sovereignty in Cuba will satis
fy the majority of the men in Congress.
These results are what the President
expected to obtain peaceably, if pos
sible, by war, if necessary. It does not
follow, however, that Congress will
drive the President and the country into
war. There is a conservative element
in both houses in favor of going slow
and resorting to war only if it is thrust
upon the United States by Spain. In
the conservative element are included
the leaders of the House and many of
the members, influential men in the
Senate on both sides of the chamber.
Speaker Reed will stand in the House
like a stone wall against any hasty and
ill-timed action, and in the Senate ad
vantage will be tak-n by the conserva
tives, if necessary, of their power of de
laying action by unlimited debate.
Even among the political opponents
of the administration there are con
servative men who deprecate any effort
to play politics with such a situation as
now confronts the country and to trust
everything to the President, unham
pered by any criticisms or suggestions
from Congress as long as he proceeds,
as they believe he wili, in a manner in
keeping with the honor and dignity of
the United States.
On the other hand, if they believe the
President is trying to use the Spanish
situation for political purposes on his
side, there will be a determined effort
on the part of the Democrats to have
Congress take the whole matter out of
his hands and pass a resolution calling
for intervention to stop the war in
Cuba.
As to immediate action, a great deal
will depend upon the nature of the re
port of the Court of Inquiry and the
message which the President sends to
Congress in transmitting it. It is ex
pected the President will inform Con
gress in his message of the diplomatic
representations which he has made to
Spain, and will say that when the reply
from the Spanish Government has been
received he will communicate further.
Under the rules a message would be
referred to the Committee on Foreign
Relations in the Senate and to the Com
mittee on Foreign Affairs in the House.
There has been some talk among oppo
nents of the administration of opposing
this reference and bringing on a debate
at once on the President's Cuban policy,
but it is improbable that this will be
done. The Democratic leaders with
whom I talked to-day told me that the
message would be allowed to take its
usual course without opposition unless
it should be apparent that the President
was attempting to delay matters so as
to carry the question over for its effect
on the fall elections.
Chairman Davis of the Senate Com
mittee on Foriegn Relations has long
believed that armed intervention by the
United States would be necessary to
.end the war in Cuba, but no one real
izes more fully than he the responsi
bilities and difficulties with which the

THE SPANISH
CENSORSHIP
VERY STRICT.
â  Copyrighted, lS9g, by James Gordon
Bennett.
MADRID. March 21. â The
strictest censorship has been sud
denly developed as regards dis-.
patches containing: any mention
of the torpedo squadron now at
the Canaries.
!Last night my dispatch of con
siderable length was stopped be
cause at the end there was a
statement, published by one of
the papers, that the Cristobal
one of the strongest war
ships of the Spanish navy, had
ieen ordered to coal with the ut
most rapidity at Cartagena and
start for the Canaries, there to
ioin the squadron, accompany
ng 1 it on its further journey as
?scort.
It appears the statement was
lot accurate, or, if so, that the
)lans have been altered, for now
he Government says Captain
nilamit has asked for another
nerchant vessel, not a warship.
President is surrounded, and he will
not favor any action in his committee
that will tend in any way to embarrass
the President in attempting to reach a
peaceful solution of the situation. He
would be glad if the President can suc
ceed on these lines, but feels it would be
impossible.
The House Committee on Foreign
Affairs, presided over by Representative
Hitt of Illinois, can be depended upon
to take conservative action. There are
some hotheads among its members on
both sides, but Chairman Hitt and Rep
resentative Dinsmore of Arkansas, the
leading Democrat on the committee,
both very conservative, and they will
be able to withstand any efforts to have
the committee act rashly or without full
consideration of the results that may
follow.
In order to be prepared fully for the
future the administration began to-day
filling up all the pitholes in the path of
peace. It is to be expected the country
will flame with excitement when the
report of the Maine Court of Inquiry
comes in. The aim is to keep the ex
citement from doing harm.
As Speaker Reed puts it in his quaint
way, "It is desirable to guard against
an inside explosion in Congress even if
there is an outside explosion."
Therefore, while all phases of this
great international problem touchine
the honor and happiness of the two na
tions have been discussed to-day, the
one that overshadows all others in
momentary importance has been the
necessity of precautions in Congress to
prevent the first false step and the mis
carriage of matured plans. President
McKinley and Speaker Reed have had
one of their very rare meetings, and
the result is that the situation is easier.
In the first place, the President did not
know, before he saw Mr. Reed, how the
SAN FRANCISCO, TUESDAY, MARCH 22, 1898.
UNITED STATES MILITARY BARRACKS AT KEY WEST.
House would take the report on the
Maine. The President does not know
how emphatic the report will be. nor
does he know what circumstantial evi
dence the Board of Inquiry may have
as to the agency that caused the blow
ing up of the Maine.
He knows there are many men in
Congress who want war under all con
ditions, and he feared that action might
be taken which would seriously compli
cate the situation.
Speaker Reed assured the President,
it is believed, that when the Maine re
port is transmitted it will be referred
to the Committee on Foreign Affairs in
the House and held there until the Unit
ed States can make its representations
to Spain and Spain can reply.
Vice-President Hobart and a large
number of Senators have said the same
thing for the Senate, and it has become
certain there are influential men in both
houses, representing both parties, who
will speak and work for delay.
The dampening of the Congressional
powder , magazine has had a good ef
fect, and it is hoped that wise diplo
macy may be allowed to run its course.
The general question of Cuba has
also been much discussed. The Presi
dent is firm in his determination to act
in this matter, either in connection with
the- Maine question 01 just after it is
out of the way. His mind to-day has
been running on the question of recosr
nizing the independence of Cuba in
conjunction with England and some of
the South American republics. This
sroposition has been very seriously en-
tertained. I have reason to believe that
the President has been considerably
shaken in his view that it is practicable.
He has had before him to-day all pre
cedents, and he finds that never before
was there a case like this. Heretofore
there has always been a Government
with a capital to recognize.
In addition to this, such men as Sena
tor Davis and Reoresentative Hitt have
declared their emphatic disapproval of
the recognition of independence. Sena
tor Davis says the only thing we can
do is to intervene by force of arms.
Representative Hitt is in favor of
letting Cuba alone. The President is
determined that, come what may, the
United States shall continue to send re
lief to the reconcentrados. If Spain
withdraws her consent relief will co
just the same. He believes that by
doing this and improving the condition
of the sufferers the Government will de
prive the jingoes of one of their prin
cipal war arguments and also provide
FOR RECOGNITION
OF INDEPENDENCE
WASHINGTON, March 21.â
Representative King of Utah
introduced to-day the following
joint resolution recognizing the
independence of Cuba:
Resolved, by the Senate and
House of Representatives, That
the republic of Cuba, having es
tablished and maintained an in
dependent Government, capable
of performing its duties, foreign
and domestic, which appertain
to independent governments, and
it appearing that there is no
longer any reasonable prospect
of the success of the prosecution
of war by Spain against said
state it is expedient and proper
and in conformity with the laws
of nations and the practice of
this Government in like cases,
that the Independent political
existence of said state be ac
knowledged by the Government
of the United States.
more time for the working out of a
peaceful solution of the Cuban prob
lem.
Thus it will be seen that the President
wants more time. He no longer wants
time to prepare for hostilities, because
he believes that we are ready for any
contingency now, or will be ready at
the rate work is being rushed, but he
wants time to avoid war and procure a
peaceful and honorable outcome. He
told all his callers to-day that he was
well aware of fhe difficulties that con
front him, but to no one did he intimate
that he saw a way out. That is what he
is looking for. and he will continue to
look for until he receives all the facts
in the Maine report. Then, if there is
no way out, he will act in two days.
SPAIN WILL APPEAL
TO THE POWERS.
The President Hopes to Sway the
Dons oy the Moral Effect of
Recognition.
NEW YOBK, March 21.â A spe
cial to the Herald from Washington
says: The semi-official announce
ment from Madrid that Spain wil re
fuse to accept any finding by the
American Court of Inquiry as to the
Continued on Second Pace.
BELIEVE THAT WAR
WITH SPAIN CAN
HARDLY BE AVOIDED
Report of the Court of Inquiry on the
Maine Disaster Will Reach Congress
Possibly on Thursday.
Then, if Spain Is Blamed, Sagasta Will Resent the
Imputation and the Critical Time Will
Come for the Nations.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, March 21.
The impression is now gen
eral in Washington that war
can scarcely be avoided.
Senator Morgan, who is us
ually conservative, said to
night: "It is inevitable. War
is sure to come. 1 have felt
for two years that it would be
the ultimate result of Spain's
policy toward the Cubans and
I feel more certain of it now
than I ever have before."
Representative Hilborn of
California, who, by reason of
his position as a member of
the Naval Affairs Committee,
is in closer touch with Secre
tary Long, said to-night:
"Thesituation is graver than
it has been at any time."
Everything is now ready for the
reception of the report from the
Maine board. The details of the
method to be pursued in handling
that report were agreed upon at a
conference held at the White House
this morning â a most significant
conference it was, when all the cir
cumstances surrounding it are tak
en into consideration.
The report will not reach Con
gress before Thursday. An offi
cial declaration to this effect was
made to-night. It may not be sent
to Congress even on Thursday,
though the present indications are
that it will be.
There is no disposition, as mat
ters stand now, to keep the report
itself and all matters pertaining to
it from Congress. It was for the
purpose of finding out what the
House would do â how far the
House could be held in check â
that Speaker Reed "/as invited to
confer with the President this
morning. Mr. Reed went to the
White House about n o'clock and
was in consultation with the Presi
dent, Secretary Long and Chair
man Hitt of the House Committee
on Foreign Affairs for half an hour.
The only point of importance
discussed at this conference was
as to whether the Speaker would
be able to suppress the jingoes so
as to prevent hasty and incon
siderate action. The Speaker was
given to understand that the report
would indicate an external explo
sion, but that the board had failed
SPAIN WILL REFUSE
TO ACCEPT BLAME FOR
THE MAINE'S DESTRUCTION
MADRID, March 21.â 1 am in position to Inform youâ and it may
be useful just now in connection with the political calculations of
the immediate future â that the Spanish Government will refuse to
accept any finding of the Maine commission which may suggest
Spanish responsibility. What is more, this intention is known to the
United States Government.
The Spanish Ministerial view is that the imputation which the
finding would have, if admitted, would be an irremovable blemish
upon Spain's reputation as a civilized country which she could not
possibly bear. If the report of the commission throws blame upon-
Spain which would carry with it a call for indemnity, the Govern
ment will forthwith make an appeal to the combined European
powers on the plea of equity and common fairness to intervene in
favor of Spain against what every Spaniard would esteem a mon
strous and iniquitous finding.
It is hoped that under such circumstances the United States will
agree to the appointment of a neutral court of naval constructors who
could carry out their work with perfectly unbiased minds, a condi
tion almost impossible to officers of the United States, who would
naturally seek to exonerate their service from all blame, and who,
without doubt, look upon Spain as an enemy.
It may be stated, however, that the Ministry still clings to the
thought that the commission cannot possibly return a verdict other
than one that the explosion was accidental.
to find any evidence directly in
volving the representatives of the
Spanish Government in the de
struction of the big ship. It was
pointed out that in view of such a
report it would be necessary to
present the situation to Spain
through the ordinary diplomatic
channels, but that pending a reply
from Spain the House must take no
action.
The Speaker alluded to the
strong war feeling in the House,
but assured the President that
there would be no hasty action.

KEY WEST. Fla., March 21 -
Lieutenant - Commander Marix
Judge Advocate of the Naval
Court of Inquiry, came ashore
at 3 o clock this afternoon ac
companied by an armed orderly
from the lowa, who carried a
bulky package of official docu
ments. These documents were
at once turned over to Rear Ad
miral Sicard. Some persons be
lieve that the documents were
the full findings of the Court of
Inquiry.
Others, who knew that Captain
A. S. Barker had already started
north with important papers,
took a different view. Their
theory was that the package
contained blue prints, affida
vits and other pieces of docu
mentary evidence that had been
submitted to the Court. Lieuten
ant - Commander Marix when
questioned on this subject, re
fused to either deny or confirm
that the package contained the
report, but an officer from the
lowa said he had been informed
that the documents were the
long expected report of the
Maine disaster. The papers were
immediately examined by the
rear admiral and Commander
West. It is presumed that if
these documents are the anx
iously expected report will be
taken to Washington to-morrow
by Lieutenant - Commander
Marix.
NEW YORK, March 21.â A
Tampa (Fla.) special to the Her
ald says: Captain Albert S. Bar
ker, who arrived from Havana
and Key West, is known to have
had in his possession the pack
age of papers he brought off the
lowa, upon which Court of In
quiry has been holding Its ses
sions in Key West.
He said he felt sure there were
enough conservative men on both
sides of the House to hold down
th<*se who were inclined to pre
cipitate immediate debate, and that
if assurance was given that there
would be no unnecessary delay the
House could be relied upon to
send the report and accompanying
documents to the Committee on
Foreign Affairs and to await the
report of that committee.
There is still uncertainty on one
important point in the administra
tion programme and that is whether
the papers bearing on the Maine
incident will be sent in by them
selves and be handled separately
from the general Cuban question,
or whether the two matters will be
submitted at the same time. In
dications point to the fcrmer meth
od of procedure. It is believed

TIME FOR THE
INTERVENTION
OF UNCLE SAM
Senator Thurston Declares That
This Country Should at Once
Stop the Extermination
Tactics in Cuba.
OMAHA, March 21.â "1f the time for the intervention of the United
States in the affairs of Cuba is not here now it never will come," said
Senator Thurston to a reporter. "This morning I wired Senator Allen
to announce that I would speak on the Cuban question in the Senate
next Thursday."
The Senator says that the only solution of the trouble is inter
vention, unless the people of the United States want to look on and
see the work of starvation already so far advanced completed. The
reconcentrados are absolutely without hope, and if the death lists in
any part of the island are decreasing it is only because the material
for starvation to work upon is giving out. .All that the reconcen
trados can now do, with their homes and implements destroyed by
fire their little farms devastated and growing in weeds, their stock
driven off to furnish food for the Spanish soldiers, and themselves
emaciated and diseased, is to remain in their pens with a look of quiet
despair and take the little food that they can get, sent by the charity
of the United States.
It is perfectly true, says the Senator, that the insurgents practi
cally have the whole island. All that the Spanish hold is Havana, and
even while the Congressional party was there, there was fighting in
the suburbs of that city.
Senator Thurston was asked what effect intervention would have
in increasing the volume of the insurgent movement. He said that it
would have some effect in that directicm, for then the Cubans gener
ally would rise and declare themselves.
Cuba will be held back until there
is a reply from Spain concerning
the Maine. Some of those who are
closest to the President say he
will advocate intervention in the
interests of Cuban freedom; others
say that it will be nothing more
than a recognition of Cuban inde
pendence; while there are still
others, and among them several
leading Republicans of the Senate,
who are just as certain the Presi
dent has not made up his mind
what it will be.
There was an important confer
ence to-day at the Navy Depart
ment between Secretary Long,
Commander Schley, who is to
have charge of the flying squadron
at Hampton Roads, and Lieutent-
Commander Clover, who is at the
head of the Naval Intelligence Bu
reau. This is the secret â¢ ser
vice of the Navy Department,
where records of the movements
of the battle-ships of every nation
are carefully kept. This confer
ence was for the purpose of per
fecting plans for the aggressive
handling of the flying squadron in
case the necessity should arise;
but, of course, the possible move
ments of that body are kept from
the public.
SIR CHARLES DILKE ON
THE IMPENDING WAR.
Declares That Japan Would Prob-
ably Be the Only Nation That
Might Interfere.
Copyrighted, 1!>S8. by James Gordon Bennett.
LONDON. March 12.â The Herald
correspondent interviewed Sir Charles
Dilke as to the relations between the
United States and Spain. He thought
that there was no doubt that if war
came the United States would more
than hold its own. He did not think
it possible that Spain would attempt
to blockade American ports. Asked as
to the attitude of other countries m
case of war Sir Charles said: "Japan
is perhaps the only nation that might
be tempted to interfere. She has not
fyund opportunities for expansion in
China that she expected, and war be
tween the United States and Spain
mieht tpmpt hf-r to grab the Philip
pines. I regard it as improbable that
England would in any way take part in
Buen a war officially. But the sympa
thies of England would all be with the
United States."
WHAT IS NEEDED TO
PREVENT STARVATION.
Dr. Klopsch Writes of the Terrible
Condition of Over Two Hundred
Thousand Reconcentrados.
NEW YORK, March 21.â Dr. Louis
Klopsch, now in Cuba in charge of the
American relief work, cables from Ha
vana, under date of March 21, to the
Christian Herald:
"The situation is simply this: Two
hundred and five thousand reconcen
trados in over 400 accessible towns are
helplessly destitute. Unless we can get
regularly, without a break, 300 tons of
cornmeal and 50 tons of lard or bacon
every week we cannot effectively re
lieve the suffering. Spasmodic and un
systematic efforts defeat all good in
tentions. Canned goods are useless and
condensed milk should be substituted.
Fifteen thousand dollars weekly will
feed every starving man, woman and
child in Cuba. Small, irregular ship
ments are only tantalizing."
CHIEF OF THE BUREAU
OF YARDS AND DOCKS.
WASHINGTON, March 21.â The va
cancy which has existed in the office
of the Chief of the Bureau of Yards and
Docks, Navy Department, since last
Tuesday, when the term of Rear Ad
miral E. O. Matthews expired, was
filled by the President to-day by the
appointment of Civil Engineer Morde
cai T. Endicott, for a term of four
years. In view of the probability of the
early construction of four or five new
drydocks this bureau becomes one of
the most important in the Navy De
partment. Mr. Endicott is an engineer
officer in high repute and is thoroughly
informed in regard to the matters
which come directly under the bureau
of which he will be the head. Aside
from this, his position as bureau chief
will make him a member of the gen
eral board which determines questions
of general policy relating to the navy.
He was a member of the Nicaragua
Canal Commission, of which Colonel
Ludlow was president, several years
ago, since which time he has been on
duty in the bureau of yards and docks.
The appointment of a civil engineer to
this position is a distinct innovation in
the naval service.

Now the Commodore Is Convoying
the Purchased Cruiser to the
United States.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, March 21.
Lieutenant-Commander J. E. Pills
bury, commanding the dynamite
cruiser Vesuvius, which has just ar
rived at the Washington navy yard
from Florida, was at the Navy Depart
ment to-day in conference with the of
ficials regarding the future of his
unique craft. The pneumatic gear used
in operating the dynamite tubes is un
dergoing repairs, which, it is calculated,
will take about two weeks' time. It is
conFidered probable, in view of the
speed power of the Vesuvius, that she
may be attached to the so-called flying
squadron, which it is alleged is soon to
assemble at Hampton Roads.
According to present plans the squad
ron will consist of the battleships Mas
sachusetts and Texas and the cruisers
Brooklyn, Minneapolis and Columbia.
The Vesuvius would be perfectly at
home in such company, being much
faster than either of the battleships
and nearly the equal in speed of the
pennant holders, the Minneapolis and
Columbia.
Although no orders to that effect
have been given, it is generally be
lieved in naval circles that Commo
dore Howell will be assigned to the
command of this fleet. He was recently
in command of a European squadron
which has just been abandoned by re
call to the United States of the three
vessels comprising it, the San Fran
cisco, Helena and Bancroft. Commo
dore Howell is now on the San Fran
cisco and will accompany her on her
cruise to the United Stales as the con
voy of the cruiser New Orleans, for
merly the Amazonas of the Brazilian
navy. It is expected that these vessels
will soon start from England on their
voyage across the Atlantic Ocean, and
the probabilities are that they will
make Hampton Roads their destina
tion. _^^_______

t?he United States has submitted its
demand to Spain, the authorities here
have been led to expect that this is
the way Spain will meet our repre
sentation.
While the sentiment in Congress
at present is strongly against arbi
tration, administration officials have
been giving serious thought to the
recent observations and are inclined
to be guided by them. Much will de
pend, however, upon the tenor of
Spain's rejoinder to our representa
tions when made.
There has also been much discus
sion here in the last few days on the
question of the attitude of the for
eign powers in the event of the rec
ognition of the independence of Cuba
by the United States. The President
has been told that many, if not all,
the southern republics would recog
nize the independence of Cuba si
multaneously with the United States,
and although no official declaration,
as far as can be ascertained, has
yet come from Great Britain on that
point, the earnest desire of that coun
try to avert war between the United
States and Spain will, it is believed,
induce her to promptly follow any
action in this direction which may
be taken by this country. Appreciat
ing, as they do, that such joint action
would be one of the strongest guar
antees against war, the administra
tion officials are naturally anxious
that other countries should follow
our course in recognizing the new
republic of Cuba.
President McKinley has had a
careful search made for precedents
which would justify the recognition
of independence at the present time.
As a result he frankly confesses that
there is no precedent. He does not
yet see his way clear toward estab
lishing a precedent of his own. If
Congress, however, should declare in
favor of recognizing the new repub
lic of Cuba, and a great nation like
Great Britain either joins in or im
mediately follows such action by this
country, it is believed by administra
tion officials that the Cuban problem
could be solved without war with
Spain. The moral effect of such ac
tion would, it is believed, result in
Spain withdrawing from the island.
BATTLE-SHIP MAINE
YET IN EXISTENCE.
WASHINGTON, March 21.â Accord
ing to the orders to naval officers, is
sued by the Navy Department to-day,
the battle-ship Maine is still In exist
ence. At least two of the orders would
seem to give that impression. They
read as follows:
â¢'Lieutenant A. W. Catlin, U. S. M.
C, detached from Maine, home; Lieu
tenant G. P. W. Holman, detached
from Maine, home and wait orders."
It is presumed that the ill-fated bat
tle-ship will not be stricken from the
naval register until - f tor it has been
finally established beyond the possi
bility of doubt that the shattered hull
cannot be raised and reconstructed
into. at least a sembianee of her former
self. Although there is scarcely ground
for the hope that the vessel can be
raised and restored to the navy, the
department will not abandon its effort
in this direction until the wreckers
now at work upon it report that it is
impossible.
RELIEF FOR
THE VICTIMS
Passage of the Bill in the
House for Reimburs-
ing Maine's Men.
Attempts to Amend the Meas
ure and Controversies Are
Averted by Eloquence.
Beautiful Tribute Paid to the Gallatn
Dead by Representative Cousins
of lowa.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, March 21.
The House to-day unanimously
passed the bill for the relief of the sur
vivors and victims of the Maine dis
aster. The bill reimburses the survi
vors, officers and men, for the losses
they sustained to an amount not to ex
ceed a year's pay, and directs the pay
ment of a sum equal to a year's pay to
the legal heirs of those who perished.
There was quite a spirited debate
over an amendment suggested by Can
non to give the survivors each a year's
pay out of hand instead of attempting
to reimburse them for actual losses.
Some old alleged scandals in connection
with the reimbursement of the sur
vivors of the Samoan disaster were
raked up, but the debate in the end was
saved from a rather sordid tone by a
beautiful tribute paid to the gallant
dead by Cousins of lowa in a short but
eloquent speech, rie aroused the gal
leries to spontaneous applause.
During the debate Boutelle said he
did npt imagine that Captain Sigsbee
or any of the gallant officers of the
Maine would dream of being reim
bursed beyond the actual amount of the
losses they sustained.
Boutelle and Cannon had a, rather
spirited exchange of personalities. The
former criticized the latter's attitude
toward the bill and the latter said he
was responsible to his constituents and
the general public sentiment of the
country, n<>t to the gentleman from
Maine, for his position.
Hilborn of California denied em
phatically that there had been any at
mosphere of fraund in connection with
the Samoan act. Several of the officers
Claimed mulling at all, and all of them
claimed only a small fraction of their
salaries.
Cousins (R.) of lowa changed the
whole tenor of the debate at ihis junc
ture by the delivery of a brief but elo
quent tribute to the American sailors
who went down with the Maine. Cous
ins said:
The measure now proposed is most ap- i
propriate and just, but hardly is it men- j
tionable In contemplation of the great
calamity to which it appertains, it will
be merely an incidental legislative foot-!
note to a page of history that will be
open to the eyes of the repooHe and of
the world for nil time to come. No hu
man speech can add anything to the si
lent gratitude, the Bpeechlees reverence 1
already given by a great and grateful
nation to its dead d- fenders and to their i
living kin. No act of Congress provid
ing for their need- can make a restltu- i
tion for their sacrifice. Human nature i
does, in human ways, its by.st and sail 1h j
deep in debt. Expressions of condolence i
have come from every country and every
clime, and every nerve of steel and ocean i
cable has carried on electric breath the I
sweetest, tendert-st words of -sympathy
for that gallant crew who manned th-.-
Maine.
Hovering above the dark waters of that
mysterious harbor of Havana the black
winjred vulture watches for the belated
deaG, while over it and over all there
is the eagle's piercing eye, sternly watch
ing for the truth. Whether the appro
priation carried by this resolution shall
be ultimately charged to fate or to some
foe, shall soon appear. Mciipwhile a
patriotic people, enlightened by the les
sons of our history, remembering the woes
of war, both to the vanquished and vic
torious, are ready for the truth and for
their duty.
There was a tremendous sound of ap
plause when Cousins concluded his
tribute.
Wheeler (D.^ of Alabama followed in
a. similar strain, concluding with the
declaration that it was God's will that
Cuba should be free.
The Cannon amendment was lost
without division.
Without amendment the bill was then
passed unanimously.
EMERGENCY CONTRACTS
FOR MEAT SUPPLIES
The Navy Department Has Ordered
One Thousand Barrels of Pork
and Salt Beef.
NEW YORK, March 21.â 1t was an
nounced on the Produce Exchange to
day, that tho Navy Department had en
tered into emergency contracts for 1000
half barrels of pork and 1000 half bar
rels of salt beef. These contracts were
in addition to the contracts for regular
supplies of the department, and the
terms were that the pork and beef
should be delivered at once. For two
years a large part of the food supplies
for both the Spanish and Cuban forces
have been contracted for in New York.
The chief supplies are salt pork, bacon,
lard, codfish, flour and beans.
William P.. Cragin of Armour & Co.
said that the latest contract he knew of
was one made last week to supply the
Spanish with 1,500,000 pounds of bacon.

To Baron El Cardo, Madrid, Spain:
Through the press dispatches I am
informed that you have challenged Sen
ator Mason to mortal combat for words
spoken in defense of his position as the
champion of the patriotism and prin
ciples of his country and its people in
the United States, with usual Spanish
generosity, selecting your own
weapon.
Now, as Senator Mason has spent a
lifetime in the pursuit of a more hu
mane calling and in the walks of a civ
ilization which has but poorly fitted him
to meet a bully-at-arms, as one who
has admired and now indorses the ob
jectionable words and patriotism of
Senator Mason, I, a plainsman, a West
erner, one of a class known as a typi
j cal American â typical because it holds
! principle and patriotism above price, be
cause it believes that murder in the
first degree cannot be paid for with
gold â hereby accepts your challenge
and name the army pistol, the old 44,
the organ of civilization, the instru
ment with which the American pioneer
1 measures justice to assassins; and
I while I earnestly assure you and all
your kind that thousands of men of my
type stand ready to step in my tracks
and pick up my pistol, if it should fall,
I sincerely thank the representative of
a thousand years of barbarism for the
opportunity to fire the shot in revenge
for the Yankee sailors who fed the
sharks in the bottom of Havana har
bor. GEORGE E. POWELL.

MAY PUT UP A
NEW POWDER PLANT.
The Giant Company Is Now Consid-
ering the Advisability of In
creasing Its Works.
The Giant Powder Company is figur
ing on the possibility of its putting up
a big and expensive plant across the
bay for the manufacture of prismatic
and smokeless powder and joining in
the business of supplying war material
to Uncle Sam.
The big and multiplying orders which
are keeping the ammunition makers
going night and day, the possibilities
of an actual war demand and the talk
of Senator Perkins and other California
representatives in favor of the Gov
ernment's nursing and stimulating Pa
cific Coast plants for the making of
war material, has started the Giant
Powder people to investigating tho
field. Julian Sonntag. secretary of the
company, is now actively looking into
the matter, and it is more than possi
ble that negotiations will soon be in
stituted at Washington.
The only powder factory on the coast
prepared to supply the Government with
the kinds of powder needed is the Cali
fornia Powder Company, which has
produced brown prismatic and smoke
less powder for heavy guns equal to the
best produced anywhere and which has
just enlarged its plant and begun
crowding operations twenty-four hours
a day to fill a Government contract for
2,500,000 pounds of brown prismatic and
200,000 pounds of smokeless powder. But
this wouldn't last a fleet long, and it
would be a small item in case of war.
The Government might not be averse
to having another souroe of supply on
the coast, especially when its only one
here is only four miles from an un
defended coast, being that distance into
the wooded mountains back of Santa
Cruz and within reach of hostile guns
that were not kept busy by the Mon-
terey.
"A contract for 500 tons of powder
would probably warrant our putting
up a new plant," said Mr. Sonntag
yesterday. "To make brown prismatic
powder we could use many of the fa
cilities we now have, but it would re
quire in addition large hydraulic pro
cesses and other expensive machinery.
If necessary we could be equipped for
supplying the Government in from
sixty to ninety days. The plant would
cost between $30,000 and $50,000.
"If we erect one it will be near our
present works at Giant, across the bay.
We are equally ready to go into the
manufacture of smokeless powder.
That require* a different plant largely.
It requires Irs machinery, but is more
of a laboratory operation with chemi
cals. If Uncle Sam wants powder from
us we are ready to supply it. So far, I
am simnly investigating the situation
and the possibilities, and cannot say
what will be done."

CUBANS WILL
BE RESCUED BY
THE PRESIDENT
In an Editorial Senator Chandler
Appeals to the People to Sus=
tain McKinley in Lib=
crating Patriots.
BOSTON March 21.â Senator W. E. Chandler, in an editorial in
his paper, the Concord Monitor, to-day, under the caption, "TheCubana
to Be Rescued; Sustain President MrKinley; an Appeal From Senator
Chandler," says that President McKinley is about to issue a Cuban
proclamation. He says in part: "The people of New Hampshire, with
out distinction of party, should with one accord support President Mc-
Kinley in the action he is about to take in the name of the United
States to relieve the devastating famine and sickness which are now
sending to death the whole Cuban population in the western provinces
of the island. RÂ«ad Senator Proctor's vivid description of the hor
rors. Feeble women and tottering children are no longer to die from
starvation and disease. Food and medicine and clothing, given by
generous people of the United States, are to save them.
"Relief will go with the approval of Spain if she consents or will
be carried by American sailors and soldiers without that approval if
she does not consent. To longer tolerate the existing cruelties will dis
honor the American nation, and the end of the starvation and torture
is near at hand. Every humane person In this whole land should sus
tain and bless the President in his coming proclamation, which is to
cause the name of William McKinley to be held in sacred reverence by
Cuban generations as long as will be "revered the name of Abraham
Lincoln by the colored race in America."
SEPARATED
MANY YEARS
Strange Meeting of Father
and Daughter Who
Parted in '61.
Come Together While in Quest
of an Estate Left by an
Eccentric Relative.
Now They Will Join Issues and Make
Common Cause in an Effort to
Break a Will.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MILWAUKEE, Wis., March 21.â Mrs.
Flora Herriek of Chicago and her
father, William Gessie, an inmate of
the National Soldiers' Home in this
city, have been brought together after
having been separated since 1861, when
the war broke out. The meeting was
brought about through the settlement
of a will in which an estate valued at
$100,000 is involved.
Robert Gessie died about six months*
ago at Newport, Ind., leaving a large
estate. The story of the litigation,
which will probably follow, has many
extraordinary features. He was an
eccentric character and drew up his
own will to suit his own peculiar fan
cies. He left a homestead valued at
$20,000 to his wife, but provided that
upon the appointment of trustees to
take charge of the estate, the mansion
should be locked and kept perpetually I
closed, except that twice a year men
were to be employed to go there, open i
it up and give It an airing. The widow,
who was his second wife, was provided i
with another house, in which she was j
to make her own home.
To his son William Gesaie, and his
granddaughter he left a small amount
of money, and the remainder of the es- j
tate was to be used in building a large j
school house in Newport. The will pro
vides that in the second story of the
building there shall be a large assem- j
bly hall surrounded on all sides with !
glass cases? in which shall be placed the j
clothing, bedding, furniture and house- j
hold goods from the Gessie mansion.
The reason assigned for this display of I
the household goods of the Gessie man- j
sion in the school house is "'that the j
pupils may be reminded of the donor j
and that his memory may be kept j
green."
There is another chapter to the story.
When the war of the rebellion broke
out William Gessie enlisted in an In
diana regiment and went forth to fight
the battles of the Union. He left be
hind him a wife and a daughter, the
latter ten weeks old. William did not
write to his wife when he was in the
army nor did he return to his homo
when the war was over. Instead he
drifted out into the Western country
and finally brought up at the Soldiers'
Home at Milwaukee. He finally wrote
to his father, and by this means- was
remembered with a small bequest when
the latter made his will.
He employed a law firm of this city
to look after his interest, and while a
member of the firm was in Indiana a
few weeks ago, he came in contact
with a Chicago attorney who was rep
resenting the interests of Mrs. Flora
Herrick of that city. It did not take
the lawyers long to discover the rela
tionship between their clients and to
show them that their causes were iden
tical. Later a meeting was arranged
in Milwaukee between father and
daughter in which an affecting scene
was enacted.
The father and child will make com
mon cause in their efforts to upset the
I will of Robert Gessie and secure a joint
i portion of the estate.

SEATTLE, Wash., March 21.â A war^

to what the authorities in California will
do in the case, in view of Governor Rog

Several weeks ago Van Smith arrived
I in Seattle and represented himself as the

An advertisement in a paper of that

Proposed Change in the
Commander in Chief
of the Squadron.
Failing Health Will Cause the
Temporary and Perhaps Per
manent Retirement of the
Present Flag Officer.
NEW YORK, March 21.â A Wash
ington special to the Herald says
Preliminary steps were taken to-da>
by Secretary Long to detach Rear Ad
miral Montgomery Sicard from th
North Atlantic Station and to assigi
another flag officer to duty as his sue
i bÂ» r. Much as the administration re
gretted the necessity of changing
h.nsc;- when crossing a stream, th
conclusion was forced upon I'nsiden
McKinley and Secretary L<jng, after an
earnest consultation this morning, tha
it was to the Interests of this Govern
ment to have an officer in command o
the navai forces on the Atlantic coas
ng in mind and sound in limb, able
to grasp and to meet any situation tha
might arise.
i Admiral Sicard has been suffer
ing for some weeks past from a sever*
: attack, and although in weak
condition he has courageously stood a
his post of duty, notwithstanding the
(1! of Secretary Lone
that he take a short leave ol absence
for at least two weeks. Recent report
red from Rear Admiral Sicard him
tnd from officers on duty in the
. the Secretan
that no Improvement in Hear Admira
Sicard s condition has taken place, and
in view of the exhausting work whicl
the admiral has to perform the Secre
believed that it was due to hin
as "weli as to the Government that h
should be relieved and given a chanc
uperate.
When Secretary Long brought th
matter to the attention of the Presiden
that official agreed with him that i
was necessary to assign another ila
r to duty In Rear Admiral Sieard's
But instead of directing Hear
Admiral Sicard' s immediate detach
ment, as he had authority to do, >
ret â  termined to place no
ifficer's record as would
have been done had he Deen summarily ,
relieved, but to permit him to have ev
ery chance to retain his present com- I
mand in case it should be shown that
he is well enough to continue on duty.
Accordingly, the Secretary, in ac
cordance with the determination
reai hed by himself and the President,
ving as Uheir object the
holding of a board of medical survey j
to-morrow on the rear admiral. These j
orders were telegraphed to Hear Ad- \
miral Sicard and he was directed to ap
medical board composed
of the following named officers: Mcdi- ;
cal inspector Michael C. Brennan, lleet
Burgeo i >f the North Atlantic Station,
and Surgeon Manly Simons, on duty
on board the battle-ship lowa. It is
proposed by the department officials to
follow the usual naval procedure in the
case of Rear Admiral Sicard. It is
hoped by the officials that Rear Ad
miral Sicard's trouble may be of such
ehara< ter as to cause the surgeons to
simply recommend his detachment up
on sick leave. Both the President and
Secretary Long have a very kindly feel-
Ing for Rear Admiral Sic&fd, and there
is no intention on the part of either to
attempt to "crowd" him from the ac
tive to the retired list. Should the
board recommend that he he retired it
will be necessary .for the Secretary to
convene the Retiring Board, which will
at once consider Hear Admiral Sicard's
condition and take what action seems
to them to be required. Should the
board of medical survey regard the ex
amination for retirement of Rear Ad
miral Sicard and the Retiring Board
recommi nd his retirement, the vacancy
thus created in the grade of Hag rank
â >* 111 be filled by the appointment <<(
Captain W. T. Sampson, commanding
the battle-Ship lowa, lioth President
McKinley and Secretary Long con
sider Captain Sampson as the best I
possible timber for the position of com
mander-in-chief, not alone on account I

GOVERNOR HASTINGS
TALKS AT STANFORD.
Tells the Students He Does Not Be-
lieve There Will Ba War With
Spain.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, March 21.â
Governor Hastings addressed the students
in the chapel this afternoon. His talk
was bright and interesting. After in- [
dulging in the customary encomiums on
the climate and scenery of California and
the ideal location of Stanford, he ad
vised the students to consider above all j
else the, problem of setting started in j
life and fitting themselves into the right
niche. He thought California offered ex- I
cellent opportunities for the industrious
young: and those who were prepared to
meet the emergencies which were certain
to come up in life.
"Most of the wrecks that are found
through life are due," he said, "to mis
fits "
He said that the country need have no
apprehension of war with Spain. If he :
thought there was danger of it he would
not be in California, but at his post in
Pennsylvania. - . .
"We are too big and too Christian to
go to war," he said. Â«...
He thought that such an affair between
two great nations should be settled by
other means. If trouble should result
between United States and Spain, he be- i
lieved we would meet the emergencies
that would* present themselves. The ac
tion of Congress in putting $50,000,000 into
the hands of the President as head of
the nation, without any question of poli
tics entering into the matter, was enough,
he asserted, to give him confidence.

ATTEMPT TO BREAK
FROM JAIL FRUSTRATED.
Riverside Prisoners Detected When
Well on Their Way to
Freedom.
RIVERSIDE. March 21.â The prisoners
in the County Jail, headed by an ex-con
vict named Harry Thornton, who is serv
ing a six months sentence for a mis
demeanor, attempted to break jail to
day. A hole sixteen inches square had
been cut almost through the back wall
of the corridor of the jail when the offi
cers detected them at work.
The men engaged in this attempt are
the ones who succeeded in getting out
of jail about a week ago. at which time
one of them. Tierney, driven back to
his cell at the point of the City Mar
shal's pistol. Thornton and Tierney are
both old convicts, and the officers have
it from trusties about the jail that both
men had planned to make their escape
even it" they were forced to killsomeonein
doing 80. When detected to-day the men
were sMrly and defiant, and considerable
force had" to be used to get them into
their cells. One of the prisoners had
stated t2 the officers that Thornton is
wanted somewhere for some serious
crime, and that is the reason he is de
termined to get away. The officers a>-e

BOND PROPOSITION
TO BE SUBMITTED
Public Sentiment Defied by the
City Council of Los
Angeles.
Will Call an Election to Decide as to
the Building of New Fire
, Houses.
special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, March 21.â At the ses-
Blon of the City Council .to-day there was ;
Introduced an ordinance of intention to
call an election to vote bonds in the sum j
of $150,600 iT the purpose of building
new fire engine houses and equipping
them. There will really be no necessity
tor tire engine houses when the city owns I
its own water plant and operates it with
proper pressure for fire purposes. But \
there is a clique here that seems to be
extraordinarily interested in forcing the
passage of these fire bonds. Members of
the clinue have real estate locations
which they expect to sell to the city as i
sit.s for the tire houses. Contractors
also desire the bonds to pass, as there j
will be considerable construction work to j
be done.
The real sentiment of the people is
against this bond issue and it has al- |
ready been beaten once, having been sub
mitted within the past six months. Nev- I
ertheless the city is to be put to the ex- I
pense of holding another election. An en- I
deavor is being made to add a rider to J
the ordinance which will make a $10 / mo
bond issue for the construction of an
other bridge across Los Angeles River to
Boyle Heiphts.
Just at present the feeling is most pro
nounced thai no more bonds should be
issued until the city has b<on restored
to the possession of Us water piant. The
. sperience of citizens in past years in
voting bonds has been dearly bought. As
a result of the last few bond elections
for specific purposes there have been nu
merous scandals and it has been almost
conclusively shown that the money of
the people was diverted into improper
channels. The City Council, however,
seems determined ,to resubmit the fire
bond proposition.
COMMITTEE OF LADIES
TO MAKE A CANVASS.
Result of Their Labor Will Decide
Whether San Rafael Will Have
a Carnival.
SAN RAFAEL. March 21.â The commit
tee of ladies that is to inaugurate the
proposed rose festival held a meeting to
day and decided to systematically can
vass the city to ascertain what support
the proposition would receive if arrange
ment for the fete were commenced. It is
proposed that there shall be no failure
if the entertainment is to be given, and
the ladies want to be sure of their ground
before they go ahead.
At the meeting to-day were Mrs. A. \V.
Foster. Mrs. Major Christensen. Mrs. L.
A. Lanzel, Mrs. George H. Foster, Mrs.
\V. S. Dreypoleher. Mrs. Captain Elliott,
Miss Jessie Elliott and Mrs. Henry Har
rison. They decided to commence the
canvass of the city to-morrow and be
prepared to report at a meeting to be
hold on Wednesday morning. At that
meeting it will be decided when the festi
val will be held, and a programme of
the festivities will be mapped nut. The
ladies of the committee are enthusiastic,
and they are backed up by the Ten
Thousand <"lul). In the discussion It was
suggested that if the carnival were held,
ir take place on May 6 and 7, and the
suggestion met with the approval of the
members of the committee. When a de
cision is reached as to the time of the
festival organization will be effected to
put the plan into successful operation.
PAYS ONE-TWELFTH
OF THE_TAX SOUGHT.
Southern Pacific Road Compromises
Its Franchise Controversy in
Kentucky.
FRANKFORT. Ky., March 21.â The
Southern Pacific Company's attorneys
have talked the State officials into com
promising' the suit for franchise taxes,
and instead of the State receiving $50,000
or $O).000 annually. ;is was lirst Insisted
on. it will receive only the paltry sum of
$5200. The State Auditor received a check
to-day for $22,000 for franchise liixt-s since
iy<l. and an agreement has been reached
for the company to pay $5200 annually
hereafter. This evidently ends the whole
case, as the Legislature will never agree
to repeal the charter of a company that
pays $5000 v. year into the State treasury.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 22, 1898.
"BOSS" REA
HAS NAMED
HIS TICKET
Alignment of Forces
for the San Jose
Campaign.
Martin the "Gang's" Can
didate for the
Mayoralty.
Political Dictator Makes the
Nominations to Suit
Himself.
NO CONSULTATION AT ALL.
Not Aware That the Ticket "Was
Completed Until It Was
Printed.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, March 21.â "Jim" Rea
caused his "business men," consisting
of Paul Pastin, C. S. Wright, Rush Mc-
Comas and A. G. Bennett, to hold an
other "mass meeting" to-day for the
purpose of further discussing candi
dates and a platform to be placed be
fore the voters of San Jose. It will be
remembered that the first act in thispo
litical farce was played last week and
resulted, according to the editorial of
the "gang" organ, in the selection of
candidates for City Clerk. Treasurer
and members of the appointing board.
According to A. G. Bennett, who
acted as secretary of the "mass meet
ing" held in the office of C. D. Wright,
nothing definite was decided upon at
the meeting held to-day in the line of
selecting candidates to complete the
ticket. C. D. Wright is authority for
the further statement that no candi
date was selected for the mayoralty,
Dor for Councilmen. Action was de
ferred to a future meeting, he said,
when a platform also would be adopted.
From facts which came to the knowl
edge of The Call correspondent it ap
pears that either these two gentlemen
made a wide detour from the path
traveled by the truth, or "Jim" Rea
has not fully taken them into his con
fidence. Whatever he may have in
structed his "business men" to do at
the "mass meeting" seems to give him
little concern. He evidently knows that
they will obey his every and slightest
behest whenever he is ready to make
known his wishes.
It was, therefore, in evident antici
pation Of what he intended they should
do in the future that Rea caused an
order to be given to Popp & Hogan,
printers, for a large number of cards
bearing. the names of the candidates
who are to be placed in the political
race by the "boss" again"?* the candi
dates who stand for good and econom
ical government.
At the "business men's mass-meet
ing" to-day the title to be given to the
"gang" ticket was discussed, but on th^i
authority of Secretary A. G. Bennett
this matter was also left in abeyance.
Here again Rea had the advantage of
his "business men," for he has already
christened his aggregation of candi
dates with the name of "Business
Men's Ticket." This designation ap
pears at the head of the cards which
were delivered to Rea at his office to
day. The full ticket is given on these
same cards, as follows:
For Mayorâ Charles J. Martin.
Clerkâ J. W. Cook.
Treasurerâ J. N. Ewing.
Councilmenâ At large. James D. Miner;
First Ward. J. W. Macaulay; Second
Ward, H. Ward Wright: Third Ward. H.
M. N. Spring; Fourth Ward, W. J. Rog
ers.
Appointing boardâ P. P. Austin, E. G.
Bennett. H. Booksin Sr.. Milton Camp
hell. E. E. Chase, Al G. Col. H. J. Fikes,
D. Hatman, John Leffler, Rush MeCnmas,
J. K. Secord, Francis E. Spencer, Frank
Stock, C. D. Wright.
By this action the boss' lines were
formally and closely drawn in the con
test for control of the government of
this city.
The ticket of the New Charter Club
was placed before the oublie more than
two weeks ago. Not until to-day was
the ticket in opposition to the good
government candidates made complete,
and then only in a surreptitious man
ner, and by the political boss who is
generally held responsible for all that
is reprehensible and objectionable in
politics in the city of San Jose and the
county of Santa Clara.
This was the last day on which peti
tions of candidates could he filed. The
total number of candidates in the field
is fifty-six. The twenty-two on the
ticket indorsed by the boss have al
ready been mentioned. Those on the
ticket of the New Charter Club are as
follows: Â»
For Mayorâ Sanford E. Smith.
Treasurerâ Joseph F. Colombet.
< 'lerkâ James M. Allen.
CounHlmenâ At large. John P. Jarman ;

In addition to the candidates on the
two tickets the following have filed
petitions:
For Mayorâ A. B. McNeil.
Clerkâ William J. Dougherty.
Councilmonâ First "\Y;irrt, William Moir

A. Vatuone, who filed his petition as
a candidate for Councilman from the
First Ward on March 11, withdrew
from the fight to-day. All candidates
have until Saturday next to withdraw.
At a meeting of the Council to-night
"Jim" Rea, through Councilman Wil
liam C. Nolting, one of his most loyal
henchmen, attempted to inflict a pecu
niary injury on J. P. Jarman, who is
suing the boss for $50,000 damages for
slander. Jarman has a number of bills
against the city for repair work on one
of the engine houses. These amount in
the aggregate to $150 45. The bills are
for mat trials furnished and work done
at different times, the largest being for
$53 75. On the plea that the claims
aggregated more than $100, the limit
prescribed by the charter for expendi
tures made without asking for bids,
Nolting, as chairman of the claims
committee, refused to approve the
claims, and the matter was referred to
the City Attorney for an opinion.
Councilman Dittus, chairman of the
fire and water committee, explained
that the claims were legitimate, as the
work was ordered by him on authority
vested in him by the Council. He had
given Jarman, he said, three separate
and distinct orders at different times.
DUNHAM LIVING
ON A RANCH IN
OLD MEXICO
Santa Clara's Sheriff Leaves to
Investigate the Story Told
by a PrisoQer.
SAN JOSE, March 21.â 1t is said the Sheriff's office is in possession
of information that Murderer Dunham is on a cattle ranch in Old
Mexico, and that Sheriff Lyndon's trip East is but for the purpose to
allow him to slip away unnoticed and make a search for the Campbell
butcher. Lyndon, who had been specially deputized by Marshal Bald
win, left San Francisco about ten days ago for Massachusetts with
Edwin A. Lowe, who is wanted in that State for embezzling $1800 from
the postoffice at Newton. Lowe was assistant postmaster at Newton.
He became $300 short in his accounts, and last November he took $1500
from the office safe and fled to Mexico. A month ago he came to Cali
.fornia and surrendered himself to Constable Martin at Mountain View.
Lowe was confined in the jail here for a couple of weeks. He told
Sheriff Lyndon he had met a man answering Dunham's description in
Mexico, and that the latter was employed on a big stock ranch. Lowe
said he became quite friendly with the Campbell murderer, and in tell
ing their troubles to each other Dunham told him he was wanted for
murder in Santa Clara County. He boasted of being a six-time mur
derer, and said his crime had startled the whole State. The man re
fused to give his correct name or tell just where the murders were
committed. Lowe agreed to accompany Sheriff Lyndon to the ranch
on which the Dunham suspect is working.
Lowe says he knew nothing of the McGlincy murders until after his
arrest. While in the custody of Constable Martin at Mountain View he
asked that officer if he knew of a man answering Dunham's description
being wanted here for murder. Martin at once recognized the man Lowe
had met as Dunham, and told Lowe to tell Sheriff Lyndon what he
knew.
Lowe did this. The Sheriff at first took little stock in the story, but
Lowe vigorously affirmed it. Lyndon finally decided to run down the
story, He obtained a sixty-day leave of absence from the Supervisors,
and started East with Lowe, in order not to arouse suspicion by his ab
sence, as it is thought Dunham is kept posted on the whereabouts of
officers from this county. He took Lowe to Boston, arriving there a
day or so ago, and is now probably on his way to Mexico.
Nolting is the Councilman who. after
a claim for $6no had been illegally al
lowed and paid Charles Wehner and
the amount had been returned to the
| city treasury through the efforts of
Mayor Koch, presented the same bill
in seven different bills, each less than
the $100 limit, and voted to pass the
same. He is the Councilman who a few
weeks ago took advantage of his offi
cial position to deliver an address be
fore the Council in which vituperation
1 and untruth vied with each other, the
purpose of the address being to cast
odium on the New Charter Club and its
candidates. Like Rea's slanderous re
1 marks about Jarman, it acted simply
j as a boomerang on the man who de
livered it and on the gang which in
spired it.

LOS ANGELES, March 21. â The

in the courts under a contest as to who
was in reality the dead man's legatee.
Silvaney was for years a local charac

made a will leaving all he possessed to
Bishop Mora in trust, the proceeds and
income to be devoted to the establish

be Silvaney's will. By this document |
Silvaney appeared to leave the prop

minor son. The alleged will was signed
by a mark purported to have been
made by Silvaney, and was witnessed
by Quijada and L. C. Flores, who was
named in the instrument as executor.

Eastern Freight Rate
Question Up for a
Decision.
Transcontinental Bureau
in Session at Del
Monte.
Large Lobby Sent Out From
Cities Beyond the
Rockies.
A FIGHT FOR EXISTENCE.
Local Commission Men Striving to
Maintain the Present Difference
in Rates.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
DEL MONTE, March 21.â The first
day's session of the Transcontinental
Freight Bureau meeting has come to a
close, and though little was done aside
from electing a chairman in the person
of R. H. Countiss, yet the promises of a
hot time to come are roseate in the
extreme.
There will be many vexatious ques
tons to settle, and many clashing in
terests to reconcile, but the grand fight
will take place when the question of
transcontinental rates on less than car
load lots is brought up. This question
is one of vital importance to every
large jobber in San Francisco, and the
opposition that will arise to thwart the
efforts of large Eastern houses which
have sent their representatives out here
to do all in their power to have the ex
isting differences in rates on carload
and less than carload lots reduced to
the smallest possible percentage if not
abolished entirely will be exceedingly
bitter. The matter, which to those not
acquainted with the situation may not
seem of paramount importance to the
people of the coast, is this:
The merchants of Chicago, St. Louis
and other large distributing centers
want no diffe.l nee in the rates on car
load lots and the rates on smaller ship
ments; and the greatest concession
they are willing .to make is the accept
ance of a freight schedule providing
less than carload rates that are at the
most not over five cents per hundred
pounds higher than the rate on car
load lots. This means that the retail
ers of the coast will be supplied di
rectly by Eastern houses, which with
the difference in rates once abolished,
will be enabled to shut out the large
jobbers entirely out of the field.
When the freight representatives ar
rived here this morning they were ac
companied by a delegation of gentle
men representing large Eastern busi
ness houses and manufacturers who
have been sent out here for the express
purpose of working together, and, if
possible, defeating the efforts of the
local merchants to preserve the at pres
ent existing rate. Among these wise
men from the East were A. J. Val
landingham and F. N. Johnson of St.
Louis and J. J. Wait of Chicago. Val
landingham is the commissioner of the
St. Louis Freieht Bureau. Johnson is
interested in the Simmons Hardware
Company of the same city, and Wait is
attached to the Spencer & Bartlett
Hardware Company of Chicago.
To offset the wire-pulling of these
1 gentlemen the large San Francisco job
bers sent down this evening a delega
tion composed of Brace Hayden of the
Dunham, Carrigan & Hayden Com
pany; W. R. Wheeler of Holbrook,
1 Merrill & Stetson, and A. C. Rulofson
i and Wakefield Baker of Baker &
â¢ Hamilton. When these Greeks of trade
' come together before the Freight
j Bureau a tug of war will result which
i will either stretch the opportunities of
local house? to greater elasticity or
snap the thread of their existence en
tirely.
The present difference in the trans
continental rate per 100 pounds on car
load lots and less than carload lots
ranges from 10 to 25 cents. The
Eastern jobber wishes this done
away with so that he can send his
travelers through the State to deal
directly with the smal 1 retail men,
and thus ignore completely the big
wholesale jobbers of San Francisco and
other large coast receiving points, thus
adding to his already large profits the
gains which are the rightful spoils of
local wholesalers. The local man
wishes the rates preserved as they now
are. and would be glad if the difference
between large and small shipments was
doubled or trebled, as it serves as a
sort of protective tariff to shield him
from outside competition. To make the
matter clear, while the distinction in
rates makes it impossible for the small
dealer to buy in the East, yet it allows
the big jobber who receives his goods
in immense consignments to sell at a
reasonable figure to the coast trade
and still make a profit.
The Eastern men claim that the
abolishment of the difference in rates
would prove of great benefit to the Pa
cific Coast at large, as it would allow
j every dealer, no matter how small, to
i ignore the middleman and purchase
I where he pleases and at an advantage,
as he would be able to reserve to him
self the profits which now go to local
jobbers- and competition, by reducing
the price at which the goods would
be retailed, would gradually bring the
commodities to the people cheaper than
they are now by just as much as the
profits of the local jobbers amount to.
The local men, in reply, argue that
the retailers will not get their goods
one cent cheaper, but that the object
of the Eastern firms is merely to shut
them out and absorb the profits which
are now made on this coast.
Aside from this question there will
be many others that will come up be
fore the freight bureau. The present
rate is one hastily thrown together to
meet the exigencies of the situation
which existed at the time of the war
between the Southern Pacific and the
Panama line, when it had its being,
and it is full of discrepancies and in
consistencies that need correction and
revision.

ferent roads now- here are T. M. Schu

SHERIFF AND DEPUTY
ARE SHOT DOWN.
One Killed and the Other Danger-
ously Wounded During an
Affray in the Street.
SENATOBIA (Miss.), March 21.â 1n a
shooting affray here to-day Sheriff W.
J. Bray was killed and Deputy Sheriff
Homer Gilmore dangerously wounded.
The row began between Ashley Cocke
and Homer Gilmore. Cocke emptied
his pistol at Gilmore, three shots taking
effect, while Gilmore missed his as
sailant. Cocke then walked across the
street, meantime reloading his pistol.
Sheriff Bray, hearing the shooting,
hastened to the scene, and getting
within a few paces of Cocke, drew his
pistol and ordered Cocke to throw up
his hands, Cocke at the same time
calling to the Sheriff not to come any
further. Bray fired, but missed, and
then Cocke. taking aim, shot his an
tagonist through the heart.
CUBA PRACTICALLY
LOST TO SPAIN.
Margalt, at One Time President of
the Federal Republic, Says the
Nation Is Vanquished.
BRUSSELS. March 21.â A dispatch to
Le Soir from Madrid describes an inter
view with Senor Pi y Margalt, at one
time President of the Spanish federal
republic and Chief of the Ministry, in
which he is represented as declaring
that Cuba is practically lost to Spain.
"Spain is exhausted," he is reported
as saying. "She must withdraw her
troops and recognize Cuban inde
pendence before it is too late. By an
immediate recognition she would ob
tain payment of a portion of the war
debt and commercial advantages."

LONDON. March 21.â 1n the House of
Commons to-day the Irish local govern

out a division and amid loud cheers.
YOUTH.
THERE is no vitality like that
of youth. It is grand. It is
great, and should be highly prized.
But when youth stupidly depletes vital
force, what is the result? It is the
same everywhere. In all countries of
the world. Weakness ensues. First of
all there are pains in the back, often
accompanied by fear, dread of dancer
that does not exist and general restless-
ness. Then sleep that refreshes be-,
comes impossible. This weakens more
and more the constitution till it is in
danger of breaking down altogether.
But sleep must be had. The man grown
old before his time seeks a poor and
useless stimulant. He should seek
"Hudyan," which will renew his youth
and his energy. This is only possible
by asking the Hudsonian doctors for
help. Then the story which the patient
tells is always similar to this:
Â§ There are pains in the back. $3
Â» And sleepless nights. g
"<% "' "Hudyan" rescues. X
Â£ Refreshing rest had. g
Â« Kidneys and strength perfect. Â£
'â Hudyan" has thousands of friends
in California, and it has them in all
parts of the world. They write grateful
letters to the staff of physicians who
lead the world in this special class of
diseases. If you have weak kidneys
why not try* what can be done for you?
There is absolutely no charge for medi-
cal advice, and, if you will take the
trouble to ask, you have circulars and
testimonials sent to you free. Then
again, if you have a suspicion of blood
! taint in your system, the "30-day blood
cure" surely clears it right out of the
system, no matter what, the stage may
be. Ask for these circulars too. They
are free, as "Hudyan" evidence is. But
don't delay. Get back that light-heart-
ed feeling of youth, and get it back
this week. Be a man and feel young
again. ' ___

He Finds.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA. March 21.â Liquor sellers
of Alaska will soon be without an oc
cupation for the liat has gone forth that
Alaska is to be a prohibition territory.
Just before the steamship Farallon,
which arrived here this evening, sailed
from Wrangel. United States Collector
Ivy went arouml to the various saloons
and hotels where liquor was sold and in
the name of the United States seized all
the spirituous liquors he could find.
Collector Ivy has just returned from
Washington, D. <".. and it is understood
lion is the outcome of an inter
view he had with the authorities there
ing the liquor question.
When the Collector began his rounds
saloon-keepers could hardly believe he
was in earnest when he seized their
Is. Having received no warning
they were surprised. As soon as the
news got abroad endeavors were made
liquors, but very few of the
dealers were successful in this, the
liquor in most cases being unearthed
and seized. The saloon men are in
dignant, speaking in emphatic terms
against the action of the Collector,
which they class as infringement on
their rights as American citizens.
Collector Ivey. who is backed up by a
large number of citizens, pays no heed
to the protests and has closed every
establishment where liquor is sold,
even the brewery recently established
at Wrangel. lie said in an interview
with one of the passengers of the Far
allon that he intended to rigidly en
force prohibition throughout the length
and breadth of Alaska, and would
shortly proceed to Juneau. Skaguay and
Dyea to seize liquor on sale in those
towns and close all saloons and bar
rooms in those cities.
The Farallon brings news that H.
Corbett ar.d two others, whose names
DOt given, all said to be from tfan
Francisco, h^ive been arrested by the
authorities and are now being held for
trial for the murder of Samuel Rob
erts, the faro dealer who was shutdown
in the doorway of his own cabin on the
Dyea trail on Monday last. The author
ities were given a description of the
murderer by Roberts' friend, who ac
companied the gambler to his cabin on
the night of the murder. Acting on
this information, they immediately set
out nn the trail of the three San Fran
ciscans, who fitted the description.
They were found on the Dyea trail on
Wednesday last and resisted arrest. In
the struggle that ensued firearms were
used an.i 11. Corbett was shot in the
shoulder, being severely though not fa
tally wounded. The suspects were ulti
mately overpowered and taken to
Dyea. whence it is understood they will
be sent t>> Sitka for trial.
The situation at Skaguay remains
unchanged. Gambling has broken out,
the gaming houses having been closed
for liut 24 hours, but now it is said
nothing but "legitimate gambling" is
allowed, all sure-thing, confidence and
bunko games being barred. In conse
quence of this many or the rough ele
ment are leaving Skaguay, crowds go
ing to Juneau on every steamship. A
number came down en route to Seattle
on the Farallon. The report that thugs
and rowdies have seized the Skaguay
w&gon road and the exacting tolls on
it is denied.
The weather at Skaguay and on the
trails has been mild, and if it continues
so for a short time there will be no
trouble whatever in setting over Chil
koot or White Pas trails. As it is at
nt many are going in, making the
journey from salt water to the lake's in
about two days. Host of those now
going in are hurrying to Rig Salmon
River and Walsh and Rosebud creeks,
where big strikes were recently made.
As a consequesnce of the mild
weather it is reported that over 2000
people with several hundred teams of
horses and a great number of dogs
and many outfits are stranded at the
mouth of the Stickeen River, the ice
having been made unfit to carry any
weight.
TRUTH DECLARED
COMPLETE JUSTIFICATION.
Circuit Judge Spencer Delivers a
Most Important Decision as to
Newspaper Libels.
ST. I.OriS. March 2Lâ Judge S. P.
Spencer, of the Circuit Court, to-day
handed down a decision on the rights of
newspapers to plead in justification in
libel suits that tho article sued on were â¢
true. The point came up on a motion for
a rehearing of the case of Charles i 3. :
Stark vs. Publishers George Knapp & ! !
Co., in which Stark sued for damages on
account of articles published.
Judge Spencer refused a rehearing of
thp case, which had heen decided in favor
of the defendants. The defense was that
what was published was true. Judge '
Spencer said in part:
"If the substance <>f the publication in
its full and fair meaning is alleged and
provt <1 to be true, the justification is
complete."

ARGONAUTS NOT
AS NUMEROUS AS
WAS EXPECTED
Seattle Shipowners Disappointed
in the Small Number of
Passengers.
SEATTLE, March 21.â Many misgivings are now beinpr expressed
that the expected rush to the Klondike from this port is likely to be
disappointing. The present fleet of vessels from here on the Skaguay-
Dyea run consists of twenty-four steamers and fourteen sailing vessels.
The copper River crafts number ten steamers and two sailing vessels.
These fifty vessels have a carrying capacity of nearly 20,000 passengers
a month, but they are all running very light at present, with the num
ber of vessels constantly increasing.
Since January 1 the total number that has taken departure from
Seattle for Lynn Canal and Copper River points is ftlaced at 14,56 ft. This
is more than three-fourths of the entire number leaving the Sound. Of
the number stated 11,763 have been landed at Skaguay or Dyea, and
the balance, or 2803, landed at Port Valdes or Oria. In January 3281
gold seekers left here for the North. February started the rush in
good earnest, as 5906 people sailed.
The present month, it was expected, would run up to at least 10,000,
yet thus far only 5379 went out. Of this number 1379 departed for Copper
River.
The crowd that has gone so far this year was composed first of
those who expected to cross the Chilkoot or White passes on the snow,
and go down the mighty Yukon over the ice fields. Then came those
who wanted to get across the passes to Lake Bennett before the rush
came. They were willing to suffer all kinds of hardships to accomplish
their object. The Copper River crowd went north early for a some
what different reason. These prospectors did not know just what they
were running up against, and considered one method as good as an
other.
BOOGE WOULD
DIVIDE ALASKA
Former lowan Circulating
a Petition at Fort
Yukon.
Asks for the Creation of a
Territory to Be Called
Lincoln.
Promotor of the Project Not Averse
to Becoming Its First
Governor.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
FORT YUKON, Jan. 2.â Judge J. E.
Booge of Sioux City, lowa, is for the
time being 1 in charge of the North
American Trading Company's business
here because of being stranded. His
destination also was Dawson. He dis
placed Fred Gash in charge. Mr. Booge
is circulating a petition for the division
of the District of Alaska and the mak
ing of a new Territory out of the north
western portion, embracing the Yukon
River district, the name to be Lincoln
and the capital to be located at the
mouth of the Tanana, the name of the
city to be Weare, after the name of the
president of the North American Trad
ing and Transportation Company.
It is an open secret in here that Mr.
'Booge aspires to be the first Governor
of the new Territory, and that his com
ing here was a part of a plan to that
end laid by influential stockholders and
officers of the trading company months
ago in Chicago. The trading company
has large influence with the admini
stration. Secretary Gage himself being
one of the principal stockholders.
The movement to divide the Terri
tory cemes as news to the people here.
At the place designated for the capital,
at the mouth of the Tanana, there are
four logs laid crosswise in order that no
mistakes as to its whereabouts may be
made.
Mr. Booge, the prospective Governor,
came here at the instance of P. B.
Weare of Chicago, almost with a days
notice. He was free to come, as he
had retired from business. His mission
he says was just to look things over
and see what was going on. He insists
that, although stranded at this isolated
place, the refuge this winter of the es
pecially unfortunate, he is still glad he
came to this country. He was formerly
engaged in the business of pork pack
ing at Sioux City, and at one time, he
declares with some pride, "killed as
many as 250.000 hogs a year."
It is the purpose of both the Alaska
Commercial and the North American
Trading and Transportation companies
to develop the Tanana country this
year. Boats will be sent up that river
and trading posts built, and the town !
or post of Weare will be established
whether it be the captial of Lincoln or
not.
Without regard to the politics of the
situation, Captain Ray is convinced
that the mouth of the Tanana is the
key to this whole lower country. There
seems to be no end of confidence in the
riches of the Tanana and Copper rivers
and Captain'' Ray shares it. This is
how he explained to me his plan for
establishing a mail route from Cooks
Inlet, a line that could be depended
upon for a weekly service all the year
round:
"From reliable prospectors who have \
been over a part of this trail I learn
that there is a practicable route from
the head of Cooks Inlet up the Shu
shitne River; that the right or west
fork of that stream breaks through the
Alaskan range by a new pass and that
the Indians from Tanana travel this
route in the winter to barter with a
trader located at the Â«*^>uth of the
Shushitne. From Circle City to the
Tanana, via the head of RLroh Creek,
is, I am informed by minei'B^.io have
been over the trail frequentl3\ not more
than 125 miles. The Indians say that it
is from fifteen to seventeen sleeps from
the Tanana to the store at the mouth
of the Shushitne, which, at their rate
of travel, would make the distance to
be by trail about 340 miles, making the
total distance from Cooks Inlet to
Circle City 445 miles. I notice that by
latitude and longitude it is less than
400 miles.
"The advantages of this route over
that of Juneau and Dyea is apparent,
as the distance from Circle City to Ju
neau is estimated at 1040 miles and the
route impracticable for winter travel,
and besides lies mostly through a for
eign country." SAM W. WALL.
Damage by Wind.
FRESNO. March 21.â A heavy wind
storm prevailed this afternoon and con
siderable damage was done both to
buildings and ift drying the ground. The
wind blew at the rate of twenty-two miles
an hour. Officials and attaches of the
Courthouse were badly scared in the
afternoon, as the tower building vibrated
â 0 as to shake the whole structure. The
false columns of tin were badly damaged
by the wind, one being parted at the
joint, and the two pieces flapping in the
â ale. They were secured by wire before
blown down.
THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 22, 1898.
STRIKE OF COLD
AT CLOVERDALE
Paying Ore Discovered
on a Sonoma County
Ranch.
Specimens Assay Four Hun
dred Dollars to the
Ton.
Vein Uncovered by a Farm Manager
While Excavating for Â« New
Dwelling.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA ROSA, March 21.â Some two
months ago A. M. Daly, manager of the
I Eckert ranch, near Moulton Hill, about
a half mile beyond Cloverdale, while
I excavating on a side hill for a barn and
i house, found promising gold ore. He
i sent some of the ore to San Francisco
; to be assayed and the report came back
| "41 cents to the ton." This was not re
j markable, but was not bad for surface
rock. Later more ore was sent down
! and this assayed $5 16 to the ton. This
! was encouraging, and more rock, se
| cured after considerable labor from the
j heart of the vein four feet wide, was
; sent to San Francisco.
This third report of the assayers has
'. been received and it has set all the
! tongues in Cloverdale to wagging and
| caused nine-tenths of the male popula
1 tion to dream of wondrous riches within
! their grasp. The last shipment of ore
assayed $400 to the ton. This is the best
| report ever received from Sonoma
| County gold ore.
The ranch upon which the find was
; made is owned by Mrs. Cora E. Eckert,
: daughter of Mr. Daly. Mr. Daly was in
town o-n Monday and filed mineral
! claims on the gold-bearing land, this
I being necessary under the law, not
! withstanding Mrs. Eckert already owns
the land on a patent right.
Last Friday blasting with powder
was begun, and on Tuesday a ton of
i rock will be sent to San Francisco to
<be smelted. If this ore proves as rich
as the last lot sent down the latest ma
chinery will be put in and the vein
: worked in real earnest. The ledge is
four fpet wide. Its length is not known,
but high-grade ore has been found in
five different places as far as 150 yards
j apart. Mr. Daly, who has made two
; fortunes in California mines, and who
' is recognized as an authority on mm;
; eralogy and geology, says:
"I know we have found gold ore in
; paying quality and quantity."
Mr. Daly has arranged to leave about
! April 10 for Trinity County, where he
i has valuable mining interests. He has
a claim adjoining the famous Graves
i Bros.' Blue Jay mine. It is located in
j the bed of an ancient river and the dirt
1 runs from 5 cents to 50 cents to the pan.
I His plans are to work this mine in sum
mer and the Sonoma County property
- in the winter.
MUTINOUS PASSENGERS
QUELLED BY FORCE.
! Trouble on the Schooner Morrill
on the Voyage to
Alaska.
SEATTLE, March 21.â The schooner
I Bering Sea returned to-day from the
| Copper River country. Her destination
! was Disenchantment Bay. but there
i were too many icebergs there to make
: navigation safe, so the twenty-six pas-
I sengers were landed at Takutat, a
small village on the coast. Captain j
i Grotte reports that but little progress ;
! has been made by the gold hunters i
now at Disenchantment Bay. The bay
has been frozen over during the win
ter, but the ice is beginning to float out
: on the tide.
According to the reports brought
down by the Bering Sea there has been
serious trouble between the skipperand
passengers on the schooner Morrill, now
at Yakutat. Before reaching there ad
verse winds were encountered and she
was driven some distance out of her
course. During this time the passen
gers became mutinous, and the captain
quelled a row by a liberal display of
guns in the hands of himself and crew.
Further trouble ensued, but without
serious result.
ALLEGED TIMBER TRESPASS.
Third Trial of the Suit Against the
Copper Queen Company.
FLAGSTAFF. Ariz., March 31.â T0-day
the Attorney-General of the United
States commissioned E. E. EUinwood as
Special Assistant United States District
Attorney to assist in the trial of the case
of the United States vs. the Copper
Queen Consolidated Mining Company.
This is a suit by the Government to re
cover $183,000 from' the Copper Queen
Mining Company for alleged timber tres
pass, and is probably the most important
case of this nature in the West. It has
twice been tried, with the result of a
disagreement of the jury at each trial.

as the One Who Planned
the Murder.

To-Day.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NAPA, March 21.â 1t was a day of
words in the Clark case, and if words
could save the murderer's neck he
would never mount the gallows. Mr.
Hogan resumed his argument in the
morning and throughout the opening
session devoted himself to showing how
the woman was responsible for it all.
He denounced the widow of murdered
William Clark and declared that if a
murder was committed at all it was
because of her. Clark, according to
him, was a person easily led by the
temptress, and to her Mr. Hogan at
tempted to trace all blame for the death
of William Clark. He compared the
plain, homely, expressionless face his
hearers had all seen upon the stand to
the glorious, still living beauty of Cleo
patra; to the fascinating wife of Poti
phar; to all the beauties of history who
have led men astray, and the defendant
himself he compared to Joseph â who
fell not.
He called attention to the attitude of
the defendant througout the trialâ an
attitude which has all the sprightliness
of an intelligent clam â and asked if
such a man could be guilty of such a
crime. The construction of George
Clark's head was also called into trie
case, and Mr. Hogan declared Clark's
appearance Justied his reputation for
peace and quiet.
This same head is the talk of all those
who have taken sufficinet trouble to
- come up into the courtroom to see it.
'It is all set forward of the neck. It ;
seems in a straight line up from the j
' shoulder blades and then the outline j
hurries angularly over the crown and
i down over the shallow, lowering bro*r, i
until it leaves his eyes just on a level i
with the middle of his ears; and then i
: leaving a dish nose and a mouth whose ;
weakness cannot be hidden by the j
! growth of hair around it, it wanders off ,
into a stubby growth of beard and
there ends in the air. His eyes are I
1 "lack-luster," inanimate, expressionless
Orb*, and altogether he looks a paradox i
â a man capable of nothing and capa- i
i ble of anything.
"The woman did it! The woman did ;
it!" was drummed into the Jury all j
day. "She lured him on; she led him j
first into the path of dishonor and then
: into the path of crime, if crime there
was," reiterated Mr. Hogan. "She did
1 it! She did it!" was the burden of the
: argument, and the man who, even
; granting that temptation was there,
: sacrificed his brother's honor, wrecked
hiÂ« brother's home and then took his
brother's life, was held up as one fitted i
j to be again turned loose on a forbearing ;
I community.
Hogan described the defendant as one !
\ who had lied to save his paramour's \
honor and who would die if necessary
to save her name and liberty, but the
testimony shows that Clark was the
! first to assail the woman's attempts to
lead a better life by a threat to tell the
j world all she had been doing.
There was a point made about the
i absence of mud on the porch of William
Clark's house and also the fact that no I
pistol shot had been heard nor had the |
! fall of Clark's senseless body been
noted by any one in the house.
Mr. Hogan also showed how a pistol
i might have been held in the right hand 'â 
: so a man might have shot himself in
\ the left side of the head, and he tried to j
: show that the woman might have j
I pinned the message which asked
j George to come over at 6 o'clock upon
I the door.
There is a growing sentiment in Napa
'â¢â  and the surrounding country that the j
; chances are there will be a verdict fix- |
j ing the penalty at life imprisonment, i
There is no gmund for the beMef, how- i
ever, except that George Clark is al
most an idiot, and the jury may take
! that into consideration and so show
some leniency. It is not expected that
there will be any hesitation over a ver
dict of guilty.
Mr. Hogan will complete his argu
ment to-morrow.
BILLS RELATING TO

WASHINGTON, March 21. -The Sen

the Sioux City and Pacific debts. The
Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary
of the Interior and Attorney-General are
created a committee to settle the debt
and to make such extensions as may be
necessary to secure the Governments in
terest. In the case of the Central Pa
cific an amendment was adopted provid
ing that the full amount of th(? Govern
ment's principal and interest must be
paid. No limitation was placed on the
Burns City and Pacific, uirl it Is probable
that Senators Morgan and Harris will
make a minority report in favor of a sim

Why the Santa Fe Has
Lost Prestige in
California.
President Ripley Coming to
Investigate Recent Com
plaints.
Change in Management May Be One
Result of His Visit to This
State.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, March 21.â Within
the next two days President Ripley of
the Santa Fe system will arrive in Cal
ifornia. He is now at Albuquerque, N.
M., and General Manager Nevin of the
Santa Fe and Pacific will meet him at
Gallup and accompany him on his
westward trip.
The object of President Ripley's visit
at this time is given out at the general
offices of the company in this city as
simply an inspection of the company's
property, but it is understood that
more significance attaches to his com
ing than the officials here will admit.
The policy pursued by General Man
ager Nevin in handling the Santa Fe
system in Southern California has
given rise to a great deal of criticism.
These strictures have come from indi
viduals, firms and shippers generally,
who have in the past been stanch
friends of the Santa Fe road, but who
are now up in arms against the road.
The result has been the creation of a
public sentiment in this section of the
State which not only has a disastrous
effect on the compnay's business, but
which also has been a source of annoy
ance to President Ripley.
A great many who could not obtain
a satisfactory adjustment from Gen
eral Manager Nevin have referred their
differences to the president's office,
carrying them over Mr. Nevin and ap
pealing directly to the head of the
road. President Ripley, while here,
will, so it is understood, investigate
the causes of complaint that have been
made against Nevin and ascertain
what foundation really exists for them.
The president will also endeavor to
place the Santa Fe road in its former
position in the esteem of the people of
Southern California, who have always
looked upon it as a safeguard against
any Southern Pacific exactions.
Nevin's friends assert that he will
have no difficulty in proving to Presi
dent Ripley that he has acted wisely in
handling the shippers in this section.
Nevertheless a change in management
is looked for as one of the possibilities
of his visit.
CHILE CONFRONTED
WITH A NEW CRISIS.
Members of the Cabinet Have Been
Dismissed, While War Talk Is
Again Resumed.
VALPARAISO. March 21.â Chile is con
fronted by another ministerial crisis. The
members of the Cabinet have been dis
missed, and to Senor Eulojo Altamiraine
has been entrusted the work of forming
a new Cabinet. The confidence of all tho
political parties is now sought by tho
Government in view of the seriousn.
internal and foreign affairs. In private
circles one hears nothing but war talk.
Generally it is believed that a conflict is
unavoidable, but I have good reason to
believe that Chile will not declare par.
Argentina will not do so because she has
too much to lose.
CROPS BLIGHTED BY WIND.

Hour.
Two of the Inmates Killed
While Escaping and Several.
Others Badly Injured.
Improvised Ropes Give Way and
Frightened Boarders Precipitated
to the Ground.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BUTTE, Mont., March 21.â The Hale
House, a large three-story brick build
ing on East Broadway used as a lodg
ing and boarding house by miners in
the employ of the Anaconda Mining
Company, was entirely destroyed by
a fire which broke out shortly after 3
o'clock this morning. So far as known
two men are dead from injuries re
ceived in jumping from windows, an
other is dying and twenty are missing,
while a search of the ruins may dis
close the fact that many transient lodg
ers lost their lives also. The casualties
were as follows: Dead â Matt Doyie,
aged 45, miner at the Mountain Con
solidated, jumqed from a third-story
widow, turned over in the air and
struck on his head; Frank Kohedy,
aged 40, lately from Portland, Or.,
Jumped from a third-story window,
turned over and struck on his head and
shoulders, fracturing his skull.
Dyingâ Hugh Boyle, aged 30, miner
at the Anaconda mine, started to lower
himself from the third story by means
of an improvised rope, which parted
fifty feet from the ground. He was just
recovering from the effects of a broken
leg through an accident a month ago.
Injured â Pat Gilligan went down
with the third tloor when it collapsed
and was rescued by firemen, badly
burned; John T. Carter, a stranger in
the city, got out by means of a fire
escape, badly burned and cut by glass;
J. J. Conroy, burned on hands and frac
tured bones of one foot by leaping to
the ground; Barney Reynolds, fracture
of right leg. he found escape cut off ajid
made a rope of his blankets, which
broke when he was twenty feet from
the ground; Mike Judge, right arm
broken; he had rescued Patrick Boyle,
who was hanging by a section of im
provised rope that had broken from the
weight of Hugh Boyle; he and three
companions made another rope; the
others got down safely, but the rope
broke with Judge. John Irwin, burned
about neck and face and cut by glass:
he jumped from the third story, but
was only stunned by the fall.
There were 250 men and women in the
building when the fire broke out. Of
these it is believed about 200 escaped
without injury. The fire started in the
bakery house in the center of the build
ing and had a good start before dis
covered.
As fast as the inmates were rescued
or jumped those injured were placed in
vehicles and carried to the different
hospitals. Those injured or only slight
ly hurt betook themselves to the houses
of neighbors and friends in order to se
cure some clothing. No one saved any?
thing but what he or she had on at the
time of the fire. The night was bitterly
cold, the thermometer registering 5 de
grees beiow zero. As long as there ap
peared any chance of people being in
the building the firemen devoted their
attention mostly to saving "human life.
It was only after there was no further
chance to do this that they began work
on the fire in earnest. The fire had
gained such headway that two hours
after it began the wails had fallen.
The Hale House belonged to the Ana
conda Company. It was built in 1595 at
a cost of 170,000, and with the furniture
and belongings of the lodgers the loss
will reach fully $100,000.

CAPTURE OF
A WILD MAN
Pursued to His Cave and
Taken After a Hard
Fight.
This Most Peculiar Human
Freak Frightened Farmers
of Connecticut.
Hunger Compelled Him to Sally Forth
and Finally Led to His
Pursuit.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON, March 21.â After an excit
ing chase of three hours through the
woods in the vicintiy of Beacon Falls,
Conn., a posse of citizens, headed by
Chief Hosford of Naugatuck, late last
night captured a wild man who has
been terrorizing residents of Connecti
cut for many months.
The freak wore only a pair of trous
ers, torn off at the knees, and his face
and body were covered with a long
growth of shagrv hair. He was hunt
ed from the outskirts of Naugatuck,
where he was spied by Dennis Ken
nedy, who gave the alarm, to his cave
in the hills three miles from habita
tion. When he reached the mouth of
his cave he attempted to bar the way of
his pursuers by letting down a door
made of young trees. His captors were
close on bis heels, however, and the
barrier was broken down and the queer
object was dragged out. He fought
like a tiger and it required the com
bined efforts of eight men to subdue
him. ..
Instructions had been given to the
pursuers, who were armed with clubs
and revolvers, not to shoot or strike the
object of their chase, as it was desired
to capture him alive. Once subdued he
was carried to the lockup, securely
ironed. He talked in a rambling vein
and said no harm could come to him,
as he had supernatural assistance.
After some questioning he said his
name was Charles Bradley, but refused
to say where he belonged. In his cayÂ»
were found kitchen utensils and a
quantity of foodâ chickens and vegeta
bles stolen from near-by farms. The
man has been seen frequently of late
dodging about farms, where it is be
lieved hunger had driven him.

SACRAMENTO, March 21.â The two
burglars who assaulted E. J. Croly last
night have been captured, identified by
Croly and W. H. Hanlon, and the prob
abilities are that the one who escaped
before his accomplice shot his victim
Will confess to the whole affair. Leroy
and Searight are the names of the as-
sailants, and both have unsavory pris
on records. Mr. Croly was resting
easier this evening, but his family and
friends are still apprehensive of fatal
results.
Chief of Police Dwyer lost no time
after the shooting in calling upon of
ficers and setting them to work to
guard all avenues by which the burg
lars might escape. Sheriff Johnson
and several of his deputies also entered
into the search.
The Chief and Officers Fisher and
Fitzgerald went to the Lafayette sa
loon, where they took into custody a
young man named Darwin, whom they
knew to be a dangerous character and
who had been seen in company with
two other men of equally bad character.
They did a wise thing in arresting
Darwin, for through him the police
succeeded in catching the burglars.
Soon after the Chief began questioning
Darwin he had him cornered. Darwin
cattne here last Wednesday from
Marysville, with Leroy and Searight,
where they had served a term together
in the County Jail.
"Where are those men now?" asked
Chief Dwyer.
"They went out to-night to do a job.
They wanted me to go along with them,
but I got a little nervous and would not
have anything to do with the proposi
tion."
Continuing Darwin said that when
they came here from Marysvllle Leroy
had some nippers of the kind which
burglars use. Since then, said Darwin,
the two men had provided themselves
with a revolver and jimmies with the
intention of engaging in a general
burglary business. Darwin told the
Chief that Leroy and Searight had
room 24 in the Vendome, a lodging
house on X street, between Third and
Fourth. Chief Dwyer and Officers
Fisher and Fitzgerald went to the
room, but the men had not arrived.
They waited for a long time, when the
chief went out and summoned Officer
Hardy to come and relieve Fitzgerald
for a while.
Just as Hardy reached the top of the
stairs he met Leroy and Searight, who
were coming out of room 29, they hav
iner changed their quarters. The other
officers were called and the two men
were taken to the station house. Le
roy had just shaved off his mustache
and the razor with which he had donf
it was secured. The officers were un
able, however, to find any revolver or
burglars' tools. This morning Officer
Bailey found a burglar's lantern in
Croly's yard.
When Leroy and Searight were taken
to the City Prison they were so ner
vous they could scarcely speak or
3tand. They trembled like leaves in a
gale of wind. On the left side of Le
roy's face were bloody scratches as if
they were made by the fingernails of
Borne one. There was also a scratch
at the corner of his mouth and
scratches on his neck. Questioned as
to how the marks came there, Leroy
Baid they had been caused by shaving.
Chief Dwyer, after having Leroy
stripped and his clothes thoroughly
searched, had him dress himself again.
Then he and Officers Fisher and Fitz
perald took the prisoner in a carriage
to the Croly residence, to see if the
wounded man could identify him.
Although Mr. Croly wns in a very
;v^ak condition 1 he raised himself up to
look at the features of the prisoner.
The Chief hf-ld a lighted candle by the
Bide of the prisoner's face, and Croly
looked closely at the fellow. Presently
he spoke, his voice h<>ing weak and
scarcely above a whisper.
"I am quite certain," said Croly.
'that is the man with whom I grappled
in the dark and who fired the shots at
me." Leroy was taken back to the City

E. J. CROLY, the Victim of a Burglar's Bullet.
Jail, and now occupies the old cell of
Mortimer, the murderer.
The Chief of Police says there can be
no doubt that the right men have been
captured. He also says they are the
same men who have committed other
robberies and burglaries in the city
within the past few days. This is not
the first time Jim Searight has been
in jail in Sacramento. In fact, he has
been locked up several times for petty
thefts and on suspicion of having com
mitted burglaries. There is a warrant
on file now against him for having
burglarized a store at Twentieth and
M streets a few years ago. He came
from a highly respected family. At
one time his father was a prominent
merchant in San Francisco. Meeting
with financial reverses the father came
to Sacramento and worked for a num
ber of years as a clerk in a department
store. Mrs. Searight died a couple of
years ago in San Francisco while her
son was in jail here for some petty
offense. The officers turned him loose
at that time to let him go and attend
the funeral On the way to San Fran
cisco he stopped at Suisun or Dixon
and committed a burglary.
WILKINS THREATENED
BY A PRISON GUARD.
Director Buns the Risk of Being
Shot While at San
Quentin.
SAN QUENTIN PRISON, March 21.â
James H. Wilkins, a member of the Board
of Prison Directors, had a novel experi
ence at the penitentiary yesterday. Wil
kins was riding a bicycle on the road
which skirts the prison walls, when hf>
was held up by a guard, who displayed
a rifle in a suggestive manner and told
the director to halt.
Wilkins replied that he was an officer
of the prison, but the guard informed him
that any one might say that, and if he
did not want to run the risk of being
punctured by a little piece of lead he
had better turn about and wheel the
other way. Wilkins told the fellow to
shoot if he desired, and kept on his way
toward the penitentiary. The guard con
cluded not to take the chances of mak
ing a mistake and so allowed the official
to go along without molestation.

THIRD STORY
Awful Plunge of Two
Laborers Near
Salinas.
Hurled to the Earth by the
Breaking of a Large
Plank.
Accident at the Now Sugar Factory
That .Neither Man Is Likely
to Survive.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
SALINAS, March 21. âAs Garrett
Hope and George Bullene, two of the
men employed at the sugar factory,
were engaged this afternoon in hoist
ing a large plank to the third story it
broke. The plank was to have been
used in making a platform for one of
the immense sugar pans and had been
landed on the girders with the men
seated on either end.
Hope arose and walked on the plank
to release the hoisting hook when the
plank broke in the center. He seized
hold of a rope and was rapidly lowered
to the ground. He saruck an iron beam
on the way down, which cut his face
open. The palms of his hands were
burned and a rib broken close to the
cartilage. His injuries are likely to
prove fatal.
Bullene was thrown forward from his
end of the plank. He fell between the
girders and in his descent struck
against a concrete pier, tearing his nose
half off and laying his left cheek wide
open. Continuing in his fall head first,
he struck the ground fifty-two feet
from the girders that held the plank,
striking on a small, sharp-pointed rock,
which made a triangular cut in the cen
ter of his forehead and rendered him
unconscious. Bullene was found to
have sustained concussion of the brain
and severe internal Injuries, which it
is feared will prove fatal before morn
ing. He is married and has a wife and
child.
No blame is attached to any one, It
having been found upon investigation
that the plank, which had been used
for some time past, had what is known
as a blind knot in the center. If sound
it would have been strong enough to
support twenty men.

STILL FARCE
AND VARIETY
"1492" Once Again With
Lots of Redeeming
Features.
Unseemliness of Female Im
personators as Typified
by Stuart
Alcazar's New Farce, Moroseo Melo
drama and the Orpheum's
One-Aot Play.
It was my fortune to be off on a vaca
tion while "1492" was here at the Bald
win a couple of seasons back, so I can
not draw any sagacious comparisons be
tween that production and the present at
the Columbia. With the exception of a
few songs and a few hundred jokes and
puns that have survived in other shows
"1492" was IS9S for me last night. And it
seems a piece that should age beautifully,
even for those who have seen it before,
since the author is never brought to ques
tion and the entertainment depends
wholly on the people who are giving it
and fleet stage management. Everybody
who sat near me seemed to know all
about the Baldwin performance and to
be quite amused by this one, so I feel
safe in estimating the difference between
the two productions at not a cent over
50 cents, the difference in the price of
seats.
The most poignant alteration is, I
dare say. in the part of Isabella, which
is now played by Stuart, of the large
Patti family. There are Black, White,
Irish and other Pattis. Stuart distin
guishes himself from his relatives by be
ing male. However, his maleness is not
insisted upon in the performance. With
out a programme you might easily take
him for the tired mother of the whole
Patti tribe.
If there is one branch of theatrical
work which I am incapable of judging
without prejudice, it is "female imper
sonation." A young woman in knickers
or in doublet and hose I can enjoy to the
full extent of her talent; but a man in
woman's clothes, affecting her guiles and
graces, gives me creeps and goose-flesh.
And I have yet to meet one of these
emasculated warblers who does not strut
like a peacock and sing like two.
But don't let my disesteem of Stuart
interfere with your enjoyment of
"1492"; he is by no means the whole
show. There are Ferdinand of Aragon
and Christopher Columbus, for instance,
most excellently well done by Carl An-
derson and Francis Gaillard. Mr. Ander
son sings several venturesome vrses of
comic song with such artless insinuation
that you hardly notice their vulgarity.
Mr. Gaillard's sones are virtuous, but
his singing is a sin. Nevertheless he is
a comedian of keen character apprecia
tion and makes a strong showing in bur
lesque.
I did not think much of Thomas Peas-
ley's tramp specialty, which was vulgar
without being; funny, but Master Tommy
Meade's imitations of Andrew Mjckwere
prodigiously entertaining. Only I could
not see where the imitation part came
in. Master Meade has personality and
voice that are purely his own; he sings
with poise and finish and his tone is de-
lightfully free aivl true. There is no
reason why he hould imitate Andrew
Mack or anybody else; there is a plenty
of good inspiration and material in his
own little self.
Another live feature is the Herald
Square Quartet, which diff.-rs from most
quartets in being really funy in the funny
songs. The girls of "1492" are not dan-
gerous to look upon nor especially siren
like in voice. They harmonize almost too
well with the scenery in the second act,
which mainly consists of an eruptive ad
vertisement for somebody's tomato cat
sup.
Those who deplore the present invasion
of farce and vaudeville may take com
fort in the news that the next attrac
tion at the Columbia will be James J.
Corbett. ASHTON STEVENS.
Morosco's.
Oliver Byron's "The Upper Hand,"
thanks to the loyal support of the nailery,
scored, from the point of generous ap
plause, a most decided success at Moros
co's last evening. "The Upper Hand" is
in every sense of the word a melodrama,
in which the old reliable components of
love, hatred and revenge are compounded
in the old reliable manner. It has been
played here before. Its story was told in
an earlier issue. It is just the son of
play that goes at Morosco's, and last
night's audience played the usual big
part in the enthusiasm of the production
They like their plays on tne old old
scheme at Morosco's, where the hero is
entirely right and the villain wholly
wrong.
Frederick Tjader, as Iko Beetam, was
fairly amusing, and La Petite Lund one
of those infant prodigies who have af
flicted the stage for many moons, quite
captured the audience. The company gave
the usual positive performance of the
usual parts.
Alcazar.
Farce comedy usually does well at the
Alcazar, but "The Girl Up to Date "
produced last night for the first time
here, is rather too boisterous to nlease
the patrons of that theater. Around a
very improbable plot are hung impos
sible incidents in a combination that is
more productive of anxiety than of
amusement. The innovation of semi
vaudeville in the third act is a nlpq^inn
relief from the play Itself, Miss Lilian
Leslie being especially acceptable in hor
coon songs. With a beautiful voic
splendid figure and catchy smile she was
a pronounced success from her first en
trance. The company makes the most'of
its chances.
Tivoli.
Interlarded with innumerable special
ties, the "Widow O'Brlon" is up for fun
again at the Tivoli. The plot of the old
farce is not entirely stifled by the musi
cal and vaudeville interpolations, but it
is hardly the same piece, for which many
persons will not be ungrateful With
Thomas Leary as the Widow ' Edwin
Stevens as the Count, Misa ri'all in a
"coon" part and John Raffael Arthur
Donaldson and Tillie Salinger well in the
foreground, the production is safe for a
short season.
Orpheum.
The one-act play, "Mrs. Hogan's Musio
Teacher," presented by Mr. and Mrs
Charles T. Ellis, at the Orpheum "this
week is a disappointment, not only to the
patrons of the house, but also to the
management. It is neither clever as i
skit, nor is it handled by the Ellises and
their little company in a manner tint
pleases Orpheum goers. Other pood turns
however, keep up the average of the
bill.
Baldwin.
"The Mysterious Mr. Bugle" entered its
second and last weets at the Baldwin to
small attendance.
"The Cat and the Cherub" and Anna
Held are of the attraction which follows.
Chutes.
The Zoo is drawing well out at the
Chutes.
Wong Hike's Oath.
Deputy United States Attorney Schlea
lnger yesterday filed a complaint against
Wongr Hike in the United States District
Court charging him with being a con
victed felon and asking that he be de
ported. Wong Hike was convicted of
felony In oan Francisco in 1883 and served
a term in the penitentiary. In 1894 he se
cured a certificate of residence by swear
ing that he never had been convicted of
a felony. As three years have elapsed,
prosecution for perjury has outlawed, so
he will be deported for the other cause.
ELEVATOR ACCIDENT.
W. H. Wiggins of the Appraiser's
Building Mangled.
W. H. Wiggins, the man in charge of
the elevator in the Appraiser's building,
was seriously injured yesterday morning
by the sudden starting of the cage. He
was caught between the floor of the cage
and the top of the door frame and sus
tained a compound fracture of the right
thigh. Then he fell out of the cage into
the bottom of the pit, a distance of about
twenty feet.
Besides the fractured leg the unfortu
nate man was badly bruised about the
body and cut on the head.
But for the presence of mind and the
prompt action of J. W. Hamilton, the
engineer, Wiggins would have been
crushed to death against the door frame.
Mr. Wiggins got to the elevator at 8:28
in the morning, and proceeded to make
the usual examination of the working
parts within the cage. He found some
grit or sand in the quadrant, or slot, in
which the hand lever was moved to and
fro to start and to stop the cage, and
went into the basement for a handful
of "waste" with which to wipe the slot.
Engineer Hamilton proceeded to the cage
for the purpose of making an examina
tion on his own account. Wiggins, in
explaining the matter, stood with one
foot in the cage and one foot outside
with his hand on the lever, moving it
gently to and fro without, however, start
ing the cage. Suddenly his right foot
Slipped, throwing the weight of his body
backward and starting the cage upward
at full force. Wiggins was sitting strad
dling the outer edge of the floor of the
elevator with his left leg handing down ;
in the open doorway at the time he was !
caught. Hamilton, who was in the ele- !
vator. at once threw back the lever and !
reversed the motion, but too late to pre- j
vent the accident. As the machine start- |
cd to descend, Wiggins fell out and down
into the pit.
The injured man was taken to the Har
bor Emergency Hospital, where the frac
ture was reduced by Drs. Hill and Dig
gins. He was then at his own request
sent in the ambulance to St. Luke's Hos
pital. The injured man has a wife and
two children depending upon him for sup
port. His salary as elevator attendant
was ISO per month, and he had been hold
ing the position for only a few months.
His father is assistant engineer on the
steamer San Rafael.
KLAMATH COMPANY
MUST VACATE
A Restraining Injunction Has
Been Issued in the Cir
cuit Court.
An Interesting Case Involving thÂ«
Possession of Â» Lumber
Plant.
An injunction was issued Friday morn
ing by Judge Morrow in the Circuit Court
prohibiting the Klamath River Lumber
Company from holding possession of saw
mills and other property on the Klamath
River which have been leased by the
Pokegama Sugar Pine Lumber Company.
The case is an interesting one owing to
the excitement created by the seizure of
the mills and property last month. The
plant was originally owned by the Kla
math Company, of which J. S. Scott is
president. The original owners were un
able to make th>- venture pay, and on
March 30, 1837, the whole plant was leased
for a term of years by Hervey Lindley
at a yearly rental of $1, with privileges of
extending the time of the lease, Lindley
to pay the Klamath Company a percent
age of the profits accruing, if any.
Things went along smoothly for a time
and Lindiey began to make money out of
the venture. In September. 18y7, he or
ganized the Pokegama Company and sold
the lease to it tor a good round sum.
The new company invested about $50,000
in the plant, cut a great quantity of lum
ber and were preparing to ship it to the
mills when a new company, which is
said to be identical with the box pool,
appeared on the scene and offered to buy
the plant. The figures they offered were
considered too low, and the Pokegama
Company refused to sell. The new buy
ers then approached the old Klamath
Company and offered to purchase the
plant outright, but would not offer a fig
ure large enough to satisfy the holders
of the. lease. The representatives of the
Klamath Company then decided to force
the sale, and accordingly appeared at the
mill one night last month and drove the
watchman from the premises with a shot
gun. President Cook took possession of
the office at the works, stationed an
armed guard outside and brought the
business to a standstill, intending to hold
the fort until the lessees would be obliged
to sell out for whatever they could get.
The Pokegama Company then secured the
services of Attorney E. S. Pillsbury, who
at once sued for an injunction restraining
the Klamath Company from forcibly hold
ing the property. The suit was hurried
into the Circuit Court, as delay meant
ruin owing to the rapid passing of the
lumber season, and Friday the injunction
was issued. As the defendants are insol
vent no suit for damages will ensue.
Lead Ores.
The Treasury Department notified Col
lector Jackson yesterday that the de
partment has rescinded so much of cir
cular 184 of November 4, 1897, (Synopsis
18349) regarding the transporting, sampling
and assaying of lead bearing ores, which
directs the liquidation of entries of such
ores upon the basis of reports to be fur
nished by the Director of the Mint on the
assay of samples forwarded by him. Por
tions of such samples will continue to
be forwarded to the Director of the Mint
with reports of assays made by local
assays for occasional verification.
Government assay ers will, whenever re
quired, be duly stationed at smelting es
tablishments for the assaying of ores
transported under bond.
Saved by Marriage.
Angelo Tosehi, a barkeeper, 22 years of
age, has been in the City Prison since
Friday on a charge of abducting Octavia
Vannucci, a girl, 16 years of age, living
at 420 Broadway. Yesterday afternoon
with the consent of the girl's parents
Tcachl was married to her by Justice
of the Peace Barry, and Judge Campbell,
at the request of Detective Reynolds, re
leased Tosehi from custody.
Mismated Couples Separated.
J. G. Lummis has been granted a di
vorce from Ada F. Lummis on the ground
of desertion.
Judge Bahrs yesterday granted the fol
lowing divorces: Frances J. May from
Enoch May, cruelty and failure to pro
vide; Mamie Tessier from John P. Tes
sier, cruelty, and Alice White from David
R. White, cruelty.
Pinioned by a Horse.
S. W. Towle. 530 Third street, was ris
ing a horse yesterday morning at Frurth
and Townsend streets, and the animal
slipped on the rails and fell. Towle *vas
pinioned beneath the horse, but escaped
with a fracture of his left wrist. He
was taken to the Receiving Hospital.
Dr. Orpen Must Wait.
The argument in the extradition case of
Dr. Arthur Herbert Orpen, wanted by the
New Zealand authorities for murder, was
concluded in the United States Circuit
court yesterday, and the case went over
to a week from to-day, when testimony
will be introduced on behalf of the pris
oner.
Held for Embezzlement.
Daniel Lynch was yesterday held to
answer before the Superior Court by
Judge Conlon on a charge of felony em
bezzlement in $2000 bonds. He was book
keeper for Captain Anderson, a ship
chandler on East street, and embezzled
the funds of his employer. Last weeÃ
he was held on another charge.
THE MATE'S
REVENGE
"Lengthy" Williams Recounts
a Weird Kxperienee of
His Youth.
"I suppose you old fellows who have followed the pea ever since you were
boys and whose recollections go back to the days when steam was yet a matter
of speculation, when iron went Into the water in the form of sinkers for fishing
lines, and when vessels, whose standing rigging was all of good manila or hemp
Instead of steel, hoisted their sails to the tune of a well-sung shanty instead of
the hissing of a winch, have had some weird experiences that would make
good stories if you chose to tell them," I remarked to "Lengthy" Williams as
that gentleman leaned over his favorite pile on Washington street wharf and
gazed down in a contemplative manner at the tide that went rippling by, mC
tionless as a statue, save for the occasional lifting of his weather eye as he
swept that comprehensive member along the horizon or let it rest for a mo
ment in approval or disapprobation on the hull and spars of some craft lying at
anchor in the stream.
"Lengthy" did not answer me for a moment or two, then turning his whole
body with the slow rotary motion of a frigate's swivel gun until his weather
beaten figurehead was pointed squarely toward me, he carefully removed an
exceedingly short and very black pipe that had been sticking from an aperture
in his face and said: "What dyer mean by weed?" I explained to the best of my
ability that weird meant something uncanny, strange, supernatural, out of the
ordinary course of human events.
He listened gravely to my explanation, and when I had finished said: "Ef
yer wanted ter say ghosts yer oughter jest sung out ghosts and I would ha'
know'd wot yer wuz drivin' at." Then relaxing somewhat: "Sit down on thia
'er stringer alongside o' me an' I'll spin yer th* dâ st yarn yer ever had throw'd
inter yer lug, an' th' best o' it is. it's true as yer sittin' alongside me.
"When I wuz 'er lad, 'bout th' size uv 'er spare pump an' 'bout ez much use,
I wuz cabin boy on th' brig Kangeroo, bound frum Port McQuarry, Van Die
mens Land, ter Melbourne, Australia.
"The whole ship's company was hard nuts, but th' secon' mate wuz 'er
bucko uv th' worst kind. I've seed many 'er tough mate, but this 'er Kelly boat
'em all. He wuz 'er Liverpool Irishman, an' had sold matches along th' docks
afore he run away ter sea as 'er packet rat on one uv them \Y. stÂ» in ocean
blood tubs, an' though he wuz "er good sailor he'd th' temper uv th' devil an'
used th' men like a Portugee slave driver.
"It wuz black eyes an' broken heads all along th' line frum th' time we
weighed anchor, an' I knowed, from th' way th' men talked when he wuz aft,
that sumthin' would happen sooner 'er later. All han's wuz afeared uv him. as
he uster say th' man didn't live who cud cross him an* he not get back. But
flesh an' blood ain't 'er goin' ter stan' everythin', an' one dark night th' feller on
th' lookout sung out th' fore sheet had parted, an' Kelly went up on th' fo'cas
tle ter see ter havin' a new one rove.
"That wuz th' last as wuz ever seen uv him, though when th' first mate cum
on deck at th' end uv th' watch ter relieve him his hat wuz foun' on th' main
deck at th' break uv th' poop.
"All han's forrud know'd that a young Glasgow chap by th' name uv Waddy
Frazier wuz th' feller that done th' trick, but none uv us ever squealed, an'
when we left Melbourne fur London aroun' th' cape Waddy wuz still one uv th'
crew.
"Xow 'ere is th' ghost part uv th' story. Yer knows that when sailors die
they becomes gonies, mates cape pigeons an' cappens turns inter albatrosses.
Well, this 'ere Kelly wus red-headed. One day off th' cape a squall cum on an'
all han's wuz sent aloft ter take in th' light sails. Waddy wuz way out at th 1
end uv th' royal yard, when along cum a cape pigeon with er head full uv red
feathers, an' flyin' straight at him struck him full in th' face an' knocked him
off th' stick. We hove to an' looked fur him, but he never cum *up agin after he
onct struck th' water.
"Now, I don't know nuthin' uv ghosts an' sich, but th" whole thing has allus
looked mighty funny ter me. Maybe you fellers kin explain it. Anyhow, there's
th" story, an' it's true, s'help me, boy!"
SUMMER SCHOOL
AT THE SEASIDE
Stanford University Classes to
Study at Pacific

Attendance.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PACIFIC GROVE, March 211.â The Stan
ford University Summer School is to be
removed from the university and this year
will hold its sessions in Pacific Grove.
Owing to the recent decision of Mrs.
Stanford, that the summer school should
no longer be conducted at the university,
it was feared the eight weeks of teachers'
work would have to be abandoned, but
the question was considered by a com
mittee appointed for the purpose, and the
decision reached that if accommodations
could* be secured the school would be re
moved to Pacific Grove.
Professor Cox, head of the department
of mathematics, came to Pacific Grove
yesterday to investigate the suitability
of this town as a place for conducting

I strength is a work of Nature. Thousands of men have been gifted with a
constitution fit to build such a physical structure . upon, but they have

with Professor R. L. Sandwiek of the

and procured from them the promise of
the use of the high and primary school

vantageous terms for boarding accommo

there is nothing to stand in the way of

This summer school is entirely distinct
from that conducted yearly at the Hop

PUBLISHING THE NEW CHARTER-
BY offering to do the work at a lower price than
that asked by any of its morning contem
poraries. The Call has obtained the contract for
publishing the text of the proposed new charter.
Our readers will, therefore, have the text of the
document in full, and can study it comprehensively.
It is scarcely necessary to point out that the charter
is a matter of grave importance to the people, and
that it should receive the earnest consideration of all.
It was because of a recognition of the importance
of the proposed charter that The Call made so
low a bid for the contract for publishing it. The in
tention was not to make money out of the contract,
but to publish the charter as cheaply as possible for
the public benefit, and at the same time secure for
The Call a document which is of interest to every
citizen as a matter of municipal politics.
By the low price at which it offered to perform this
work of publication The Call saved to the city a con
siderable sum of money. It will publish the charter
at just about cost, and seeks no profit other than that
which will come from the increased demand for the
paper from citizens who wish to post themselves on
the terms of the proposed new form of municipal
government, and from the popular appreciation of
the fact that the publication is to be made under con
ditions which are so economical and advantageous to
the municipal treasury.
VARIETIES IN TELEPHONE RATES.
A DEBATE in the United States Senate jon a
bill limiting the charges that may be made for
telephone service in the District of Columbia
brought out a good deal of information concerning
the telephone business and disclosed the fact that
there is an almost infinite variety in charges made for
such service in different sections of the Union, and
even between different cities of the same section.
It appears that the charge for telephone connection
in Washington is from $140 to $150 a year, accord
ing to the service. In that city the telephones are in
the hands of a monopoly. Senator Cullom showed
what rates could be profitably given under stress of
competition by citing his own city, Springfield, HI.,
and made a good point in doing so, for the rate in
Springfield is but Â§36.
Information given by other Senators shows that
charges for special metallic current are: In Mil
waukee, $120; in Louisville, $111; Atlanta, $90; Phil
adelphia, $160; Boston, $168; St. Paul, $120; and
Newark, $150. In opposition to these high rates it
vvas noted that in Augusta, Ga.. the rate is $30; Rich
mond from $18 to $30: in Kansas City, $12 for resi
dences and $18 for business houses; and in Roanoke,
Va., from $12 to $20.
One of the best illustrations of the benefits accru
ing from competition in the business was derived
from the experience of Detroit. In that city the Bell
telephone rates were from $50 to $72 a year. The
Home Telephone Company was organized, and the
Bell Company at once reduced the rates to from $24 to
$36 a year. As a result of the reduction in charges
the number of subscribers in the city increased from
less than 7000 to over 12,000. In this connection it
may be noted that under the present high charges in
Washington the number of telephone subscribers in
that comparatively large and wealthy city is less than
2000.
There seems no other reason for this wide variation
in different cities than that some of them will submit
to high charges and others will not. The rate is
fixed not on what the traffic will bear, but what the
people will bear. The Senate passed the bill limiting
the rates which the monopoly may charge in Wash
ington to $50 a year for the use of a telephone on a
separate wire, and $25 on a wire on which four or
more telephones are operated. It appears, therefore,
that while competition can do much, legislation also
can do something.
"Hyena press" is the characterization applied to
some of the papers of Havana, and it is doubtless
correct. But the charge is weakened apparently by
coming from a sheet which by climbing as high in
the moral scale as the hyena would be visibly im
proved.
When the Examiner demonstrated that it did not
know one end of a ship from another it merely gave
an illustration of the knowledge it is apt to have
concerning any subject it undertakes to treat.
Assistant Secretary Roosevelt sometimes makes
mistakes, being human, but his denunciation of
Hearst's paper as a lying, rascally sheet seems to be
(lawless.
One reason for not getting excited over the report
that in case of war France will be an ally of Spain is
that there is not the faintest reason for believing it.
fJBOUT PRECEDENTS.
1"^ HE Chronicle makes an airy skip-jump-and
hop over the constitution in discussing annexa
tion by joint resolution. It says that Congress
established a precedent in the Texas case, and Con
gress can now originate another precedent. It is
well not to forget the details of the Texas case. All of
Florida and Louisiana had been the property of
Spain. Louisiana included Texas. Spain by treaty
ceded to France all of her possessions on the conti
nent except Florida. In 1806 the United States by
treaty annexed to our territory all of Louisiana. In
1819 we made a treaty with Spain annexing Florida
and ceding to her the Texan part of Louisiana. The
King of Spain did not ratify this treaty until after he
had lost Mexico by the revolution. It was held,
therefore, that his ratification only conveyed to the
United States Florida, over which he had juris
diction, and that his ratification did not convey Texas
to Mexico. In this nice question was the germ of
our contention with Mexico that finally led to war.
As a result of the battle of San Jacinto, Santa Anna
made a treaty conceding the independence of Texas,
which thereupon set up for herself as the Lone Star
Republic.
It will be seen, then, that our surrender of Texas
by the treaty of 1819 was imperfect; that Mexico's
claim was defective; and that admission of Texas by
joint resolution as a State was the actual recovery of
domain over which we had always retained a shadow
of title. Texas was not annexed as territory, but was
admitted as a new State into the Union by express
authority of the constitution granted to Congress.
Precedent was followed, not invented. The constitu
tional theory and practice that alien territory' can De
annexed only by the treaty-making puwer of the con
stitution was left undisturbed.
The Chronicle avows itself ready and willing now
to establish a precedent, which will ignore the treaty
making power and arrogate to Congress a power
which no expounder of the constitution has ever pre
tended that it possesses. Congress can establish no
precedent unwarranted by the fundamental law. If
it could, the work of Chief Justice Marshall, in defi
nition of the powers of the three co-ordinate branches
of the Government, would not be worth the binding
of the books in which it is inscribed.
When Tim Campbell represented Tammany in
Congress he introduced a bill that was declared un
constitutional by the Judiciary Committee. Tim
heard the report, and, addressing the chair, said,
"Mr. Speaker, what's the constitution amongst
friends?"
The Chronicle seems to follow Tim's construction
(if the fundamental law. Between such friends as the
island oligarchy and the Chronicle the constitution
may not amount to much, but to the great body of
the American people it amounts to the charter of all
the rights they have, and should not be violated in
the smallest particular lest it become ineffective in
all its parts.
Will the Chronicle say, once for all, whether it
favors the immediate admission of Hawaii as a State
or whether it favors its annexation as a county of
California, or whether it favors its annexation as a
territory, ultimately to be admitted as a State?
Will it also cite the constitutional authority for the
accomplishment of the second and third plan by joint
resolution instead of by treaty?
Let it be remembered that this country fought four
years of destructive and costly war to establish the
constitution as the supreme law of tne land, and if
now that instrument may be set aside the sacrifice
made in its behalf was valor, life and treasure spent
in vain.
QUESTION OF THE AGE.
IN the local columns was recently recorded an ac
cident to a wheelman, and over it was the caption,
"Aged Cyclist Injured." A natural supposition was
that some venerable grandfather had come to grief.
The real fact, shown by a reading of the article, was
that the rider was 50 years old.
Now, if this century has been marked by so swift
a gait as to make proper the calling of a man of 50
"aged" it is time to slow up. Such a man should be
in his prime, unless he be a prize-fighter, in which
case he doesn't count. At the fifty mark the doctor,
the lawyer, the banker and the citizen generally has
just a sprinkling of the white hairs which are indica
tive of wisdom. If at this stage he is to be called
"aged" a clear insinuation that he has entered upon
the sere and yellow, there is little use in one's pre
paring himself for a career of usefulness. As a boy
devoid of experience he cannot have the full confi
dence of the rest of the world, and when, as a man of
50, he falls off his wheel, only to have the incident re
garded as an episode in the progress of senile decay,
life appears too short to bother with.
Any day in the park may be seen men whose
snowy heads bespeak the passing of at least three
score years over them, yet pedaling away like a lot of
youngsters. Some of them can add a half-score or
more to these figures and go spinning along, shed
ding the incubus of accumulating decades as they glide
and feeling as youthful as if yet to cast their first vote.
So it is not fair to term the fifty-year man "aged."
The one thus misrepresented would have a perfect
right to ask a retraction, and, not getting it, throw a
few copy-readers downstairs, just to convince them
of their error.
UNIFORM WEIGHTS OND MEASURES.
A MORNING contemporary suggests that the
MahonSy law establishing State and county
"sealers" of weights and measures throughout
California contains the germ of a valuable reform
which should not be lost sight of amid the indiscrimi
nate abuse now being heaped upon that statute. This
is true. Indeed, it was the existence of a demand for
a legal and uniform State system of weights and
measures which led Mahoney to concoct his law.
Being a politician, he could see no way of achieving
results except by creating more offices, and, in ac
cordance with his principles, evolved the State and
county "sealers."
The same effect would have been produced by es
tablishing a State standard of weights and measures.
Such a standard might be enforced by making it a
misdeameanor to use any other. The Sheriffs, police
officers and constables of the State under such a law
could, with the aid of the courts, see to it that the
people are not defrauded by inadequate weights or
short measures. If it were not practicable to estab
lish a State standard by law the Governor, Secretary
of State and Attorney-General could have been
authorized to adopt one. In this way the valuable
reform referred to by our contemporary might have
been effected without fastening upon the mercantile
community a hoard of mousing fee-takers.
The objection to the Mahoney law is that it estab
lishes an unnecessary and unjust method of taxation,
entirely foreign to the constitution. Business men
now pay real and personal property taxes, license
taxes, internal revenue and custom taxes, besides
other smaller impositions, and to pile upon them an
additional tax for examining their weights and meas
ures is in the nature of an outrage. We are willing
to concede that a State standard of weights and meas
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 22, 1898.
ures would be a good thing. No honest tradesman
could object to it. Indeed, such a standard would
probably be received by the mercantile community
with favor. But establishing a uniform method of
ascertaining weights and measures and fastening upon
the State fifty-seven new office-holders with power to
mulct tradesmen for unconstitutional fees are two
different things.
The next Legislature should be required to reform
the Mahoney law. Governor Budd, who is likely to
be called upon under the opinion of the Attorney-
General to appoint several of these county "sealers,"
may properly direct the attention of that body to the
subject. If it be true, as our contemporary says, that
the consuming public is now being generally cheated
in weights and measures, a uniform system should
be adopted as soon as possible. There is no question
that such a system could be enforced without costing
either the State or business men a cent.
SOME enterprising New York men have begun
discussing the advisability of opening a grand
universal exposition in that dry in 1901. The
idea is to take advantage of the collection of exhibits
of all nations in Paris in 1000 and provide a place
where they can be displayed in this hemisphere before
they are dispersed and scattered.
The discussions have not yet reached the point of
developing activity. At present it Is but a project,
and not a movement. Nevertheless, the matter is
one which concerns us, for if we permit the New-
Yorkers to get ahead of us in an enterprise of this
kind and be first to ask an appropriation from Con
gress for an international exposition in that year our
chances of obtaining a large appropriation will be
much diminished.
Philadelphia has already put forward a project for
holding a great exposition in 1899. Her representa
tives have made application at Washington for an
appropriation for $300,000 to be employed in the con
struction of buildings and $50,000 to be used in pro
moting exhibits of goods from foreign countries. In
addition to these sums, the Government will be
asked to appropriate a further amount for the pur-
pose of making a Governmental exhibit. Bills pro
viding for these appropriations are now before Con
gress, and it is likely they will be adopted either at
this session or that of the coming winter.
If Philadelphia gets the right of way for 1899 and
New York comes in for 1901 our chance for getting
a good appropriation would be limited to 1900. That
year would suit us perhaps as well as any, but it is
known that a considerable number of people favor an
exposition for the season following the grand display
at Paris. In order, therefore, to give those who pre
fer that year for holding the expedition a fair oppor
tunity to develop their plan, California should act
promptly in getting the project into shape. If we are
to hold our great fair in the year succeeding the
Parisian display we must present our claim before
New York does or we will have a hard fight on our
hands to win.
Upon no consideration have we any time to lose
in an enterprise of this nature. Expositions con
ducted on a large scale have become so popular in
the United States, they have proved so profitable to
their promoters and so beneficial to the general pub
lic that Eastern cities are vyÂ» n K with one another in
a contest for the right of holding them, as it seems
to be conceded that no two shall be held in the Unit
ed States at the same time.
At Atlanta and at Nashville the South in rapid suc
cession has held two exposition?. The upper Mis
sissippi Valley region will hold one this summer at
Omaha. Philadelphia will hold one next year. After
that the field is open for all aspirants, and many will
enter it. New York is already planning for the move
ment California has no time to waste if she intends
to get there first.
NAVAL APPROPRIATIONS.
REPORTS from Washington to the effect that
the President has received in advance full in
formation of the results of^he inquiry into the
cause of the destruction of the Maine and is prepared
to send the official report to Congress with a short
message as soon as it arrives hardly require confir
mation. It is a matter of course that in an issue of
this urgency the board would keep the President in
formed of the trend of evidence given during the in
vestigation, and it is equally a matter of course that
the President in turn should at once notify Congress
of the conclusions reached. In fact, should -the find
ings of the board raise an issue involving the question
of war, it will be imperative upon the President to
transmit them to Congress, since only Congress has
the power to declare war.
It is therefore certain that within a few days more
the country wil! learn what view our Government
takes of the situation and what are the prospects of a
peaceful settlement of the issue. It is under these
circumstances that the House of Representatives will
begin to-morrow to debate the naval appropriation
bill. The influence of the crisis will be felt more or
less by every member of the House, and the outlook
is that the consideration of the measure will be an
occasion for an outpouring of patriotic oratory rather
than a debate on the amount of money involved in
the appropriation.
The country will lose nothing by this substitution
of patriotism for the old fashion or haggling over
naval appropriations. It is full time that something
was done to provide the nation with a navy strong
enough not only to guard its long coast line, but to
protect its shipping and its interest* fn all parts of
the world. In these days of steam warships and guns
capable of throwing explosive shells for miles we are
no longer safe in the mere fact of our remoteness
from Europe. A weak nation like Spain can menace
us with something of danger, and in a conflict with
a first-class power the menace with our present navy
would be portentous indeed.
In the affairs of nations there are always proba
bilities of war, and in our case such wars as come
will almost certainly be fought mainly on sea. We
must therefore prepare to make ourselves a sea power,
and that of no mean importance. Along the Atlantic,
the Gulf and the Pacific we have three vast coast
lines to defend, and, moreover, an increasing foreign
commerce to protect. The importance of an ample
navy has been recognized by our ablest statesmen of
all parties, and the people are now fully conscious of
the need. It is therefore a matter for congratulation
that at last Congress approaches the consideration of
a naval appropriation bill with thoughts above the
level of buncombe economy. This is the week of
crisis and of patriotism, and it is not too much to
expect that out of it will arise a navy worthy of the
republic and equal to the defense of its coasts and its
flag all around the globe.
Truly the spectacle of France and Russia locked in
an embrace of mutual affection is a touching one. It
is designed principally to touch anybody who may
oppose the combination.
According to an evening paper a filibuster is to run
the "gauntlet." It is difficult to understand ju?t how
this is to be accomplished. Perhaps the paper means
"gantlet"

MEET WITH
SIGNAL DEFEAT
Jury in Judge Campbell's
Court Returns a Verdict
of Guilty.
The Police Are Making Desperate
Efforts to Prevent Women From
Degrading Themselves.
The efforts of The Call to suppress I
the poolrooms frequented by women
have called forth words of commenda
tion from men and women who have
the social and moral welfare of iho
community at heart.
The fact that women of all sorts and
conditions were degrading themselves
by visiting these dens of iniquity and
squandering their money in making
pools on horse races was a genuine
surprise to the public at large, and al
though some were inclined to doubt the
possibility of certain classes of women
being so lost to a sense of shame the
evidence submitted in the columns of
The Call was so conclusive that they
were forced to the conviction that the
] lain, unvarnished truth was being
told.
When once the spirit of gambling is
thoroughly aroused in a woman it is
hard to eradicate it. In this respect she
is worse than a man, as her emotions
are keener and she has less control over
them. She is easily made the dupe of
the wily pool-seller, who spurs her on
to make more sacrifices of her money
by lying- to her about/ the winnings that
other women have made.
That married women are frequenters
<-i the poolrooms has been demonstrat
ed beyond question by the police, and
Secretary Frank Kane of the Pacific
Coast Society for the Suppression of
Vice will probably soon have his hands
full if he carries out his threat to ap-
I'ly to^_the courts for letters of guar
dianship over the children of these wo
men. It is not an idle threat on the
part of Secretary Kane, but he means
what he says, and as soon as he has
sufficient evidence in his hands he will
make an example of some of these
women.
The police, stimulated by the expose
in The Call, are determined to make
one last desperate effort to prevent
women from practically unsexing them
selves by visiting these poolrooms, and
if the existing laws are found to be in
adequate tin- Board of Supervisors Will
be asked to pass an ordinance to meet
the requirements.
The police by their action on Satur
day in >: two men at all the
poolrooms known to bo frequented by
women in the "tenderloin district,"
with instructions to take ali the names
â  : the visitors with the object of arrest
ing them for vagrancy, gave evidence
belr hearty co-operation with Tho
Call, and yesterday another proof was
y.iv> n of their sincerity in the premises.
Â»J There are it few poolrooms in the dis
trict south of Market street, and yes
ay morning Captain Spiilane per
sonally saw that two officers were sta
tioned at each c-f the poolrooms who re
ceived the same instructions as those in
the '"tenderloin district." The places
visited were: ESr-Senator Dunn's rooms
on Stevenson street, near Third; corner
I Fourth and Mission streets; corner
K"urth and Stevenson streets in the
basement <â ; the Cafe Royal, and at
rooms 3_'O, 321, 322 and 325 in the Parrott
building on Market street. Room oJu is
occupied by McGee & Burbridge, 321 by
Stuart & Co., 322 by 11. A. Morse & Co.
and 325 by Joseph Hheridan.
Policeman John Jordan, who was one
of the. officers detailed in the Parrott
building, reported to Captain Spillane
that the men occupying thes
elaimed that they dealt only in New
York si"< ks and Chicago grain and pro
visions. MeGee& Burbridge Bhowed him
a broker's license from January 27, LBB7,
to February 26, IS9S, and Sheridan
Bhowed him a license dated January 1,
Notwithstanding these protestations
Jordan kept his eagle eye on th>- people
visiting tnese rooms and he reported
that from 7:15 a. m. till 1- noon, when
he was relieved by another --Hirer, fiye
ladies and several men visited the
rooms. When a lady entered he i l-
If>weu her and politely asked her num.
and address. They all indignantly re
fused to accede to the officer's request,
and questioned his right to ask foi the
information. Two of the ladies made
th<- excuse that they were friends of the
ladies in charge of the telephone and
had called to see them. The other three
said it was none of the officer's business
and curtly told him that they had a
right to go where they pleased. Jor
dan was unable to get .my of their
names, but if he sees them there again
lie will arrest them for vagrancy and
their identity will be known.
Policemen Tracy and McEntee, who
were stationed at ex-Senator Dunn's
â¢ ooms on Stevenson street, arrested
in th" afternoon John Connolly, a clerk.
for s- -iiiiii; pools and Jam. s F. Blanch
aid, a stableman, for buying po<
the horse races. Policemen Donovan
andO'Connell were stationed at I
and Stevenson streets and arrested Jo
seph Dow, a clerk, and George Wright,
the former for selling pools and the lat
ter for buying them. When Chief Lees
learned that the two latter were selling
and buying pools on the Jeffries-Jack
son fight he notified Captain Spiliar.e
not to make any more arrests on that
charge, as the department was only
after the poolrooms where pools were
sold and bought on horse races.
As an evidence of the growth of the
evil i I women gambling on horse races
Captain Spiliane received a report yes
terday from Sergeant Con boy that the
proprietors of the Custer lodging-ho-use,
LÂ»OG Market street; the Cosmo House,
1020 Market street, and the Leland
House. 1118 Market street, had been ap
proached by poolsellers to lease rooms
for selling pools to women, but they
had declined. In the Vendome, on Mar
ket and Turk streets, rooms nad been
i for this purpose, but the poolmen
left a week ago and removed to liason
The police scored a great victory yes
. afternoon, which fa attributed
to the crusade made by The tall
against the poolrooms. For months it
has been impossible to get a conviction
by a jury In any of the police courts.
The juries made it clearly understood
that so long as pool Belling was permit
,, i , :) the race track they saw no- rea
son why it should not be permitted out
tide the tia.-k. In other words, ther*
was no use rutting off the branches
and leaving the root untouched.
The police and Police Judges had
I given up hope of ever being able to se-
I cure a conviction and when a jury was
i impaneled in Judge Campbells court
! yesterday afternoon to try the case of
Dan Crowley, charged with violating
| the poolroom ordinance at 11 Mason
street, the usual result was confidently
anticipated. Ex-Judge Murphy was en
gaged as special prosecutor and the de
fendant was represented by Attorneys
Lennon, Hawkins and J. N. E. Wilson.
After hearing the evidence, which
was, as in former cases, clear and con
clusive, the jury retired and were only
out about two minutes when they re
turned with a verdict of guilty. It was
so unexpected that there was silence in
the oburt for a minute and thp Judge
in his astonishment asked the foreman
to repeat the verdict. There were a
large number of pool sellers in the
court, and the verdict acted like a wet
blanket upon them. They were simply
dumfoundedL
The attorneys for the defendant made
the usual motions which were denied,
and then they gave notice of appeal to
;!. Superior Court. The defendant was
ordered to appear for sentence this
morning.
The case of Dick Creighton will be
tried before a jury in Judge Low's
court this afternoon, when ex-Judge
Murphy will also prosecute, and it will
be a great victory for The Call and the
â¢ i: a verdict of guilty is also re
turned.
i n\ account of the expose in The Call
of the poolrooms whien are patronized
exclusively by women, McKee & Bur
bridge, who conduct the Pacific Stock
Exchange in rooms 320 and 321 of the
Parrott building have concluded to go
out of business. In a communication
addressed to Captain Spillane the men
state that they have decided to "close
up shop," as there is no more money
to lie derived from their women pat
rons.
THE HOFF CASE BESUMED.
More Argument Advanced as to the
Origin of the Coupling Pin.
The ease of Albert Hoff on trial for
the murder of Mrs. Mary Clute was re
sumed before Judge Cook yesterday
morning.
Dr. T. G. Inman was the first witness
called, and testified as to the condition
of the body when he arrived. "When I
saw the body," he said, "it was lying in
a pool of blood in the center of the room
with the clothes drawn up over the shoe
tops. There were several fractures and
gashes upon the head which convinced
me that death had resulted from blows
inflicted by a blunt instrument. Life had
been extinct some minutes before I ar
rived. As I could do nothing I notified
the police of what had occurred and left
the premises."
Samuel B. McLenegan, superintendent
of the San Francisco and San Mateo Rail
road, was next called, and testified that
during his residence in the house in which
Mrs. Clute was killed a coupling pin had
never been brought into the house, and
the witness was positive when he left
the house the coupling pin with which
Mrs. Clute was killed was not there.
Mrs. E. P. Hardy, who occupied the
house after Mr. McLenegan's removal
until August. IK'.tT. testified that when she
vacated the building no coupling pin was
there.
Eugene C. Robison, the policeman who
had been detailed to the scene of tne
murder the afternoon Mrs. Clute was
murdered, was the first to go on the stand
in the afternoon. His testimony, in sub
stance, was a corroboration of that given
at the preliminary examination in the
Police Court.
He detailed his visit to the house and the
finding of the coupling pin, half covered
with blood, in the northwest corner of
the parlor or upper front room, as it is
characterized. The coupling pin found on
the premises the day Of the murder was
.shown to him and he was asked if that
was the one he had seen that day. He
claimed that it was, and pointed out the
blood stains on the pin below the rim.
The identity of the coupling pin and
whether it was found on the premises
before the time thru Mrs. Clute has been
supposed to have been killed constituted
the chief argument of the entire proceed
ings.
Deputy Coroner O'Brien was recalled to
testily, and the evidence given by him
was simply a corroboration of that given
by him at the preliminary proceedings in
the Police Court.
1,. McGlnnis, also a Morgue official, tes
tified as to taking: the rings from the
murdered woman's fingers and handing
them into the possession of Detective
Seymour.
The examination of C. H. Clark, broth
er-in-law of Mrs. Clute, followed. A
photograph of the dead/? woman was
shown to him which he positively identi
fied.
John Faris testified that when Hoff
entered his grocery store the morning af
ter the murder he was pale and showed
evident signs of nervousness. His testi
mony was as follows:
When Hoff entered the slot* he n^k<-,i me if
I was afraid of him. and I answered no. I lit
I would like to have my money which he said
he would pay in a few diya. Ho had one
hand hanging down at his side which he ex
tended toward me. saying, "i>>.>k at that! '
There was a cut on the palm of his left h.inj
which from my recollection . was slight!''
curved. I poured a little whisky m the cut
and found that the outer surf ace, of the wound
was covered with a hard coagulated M > 1 1.
while iii M inner surface as I spread the wr.ntiÂ«i
open was covered with fresh blood. â¢! txkei
him how he did it, and he told me that ne
had picked up a plank In the stre and cut
his hand on a projecting nail.
The carpet bag which Hoff usually
carried was shown the witness and posi
tively identified as the same which he
saw thrown over the left shoulder of Hoff
hi several occasions as he left his store,
fully substantiating the theory that Hoff
is left-handed and with the left hand com
mitted the crime for which he is now
:x'ing tried. This testimony concluded the
:ria! proceedings of the day and the court
tvas adjourned until this morning.

Peary the Explorer on Baking Pow
ders.
Those going to the Klondike must re
member that a reliable baking powder
is an absolute necessity. If, after a long
and expensive trip and the great cost
of transportation, the baking powder
proves inferior or has lost its strength
the miner will be practically helpless.
It is no time or place to experiment.
What is required is a baking powder
that hae actually stood the test of the
Arctic climate.
The well- known explorer, Lieutenant
Peary, 11. S. N., says of Cleveland's
baking powder, which he used on his
Arctic expeditions:
â¢â¢Cleveland's stood the tests of use in
those high latitudes and severe tem
peratures perfectly and gave entire

there is no better baking powder made

Extract from an article on the Thomson watt mettr written by H. N. Sessions, ex
pert electtieian.
Merrily the wheels go round scoring
up watts of electricity that are never
consumed, and wearily the victims
draw upon their bank accounts to meet
the demands of conscienceless corpora
tions.
Truly the Thomson watt-meter is a
wonderful device and nobody under
stands the depth of its depravity bet
ter than Expert Sessions, who Is quoted'
above, unless it is the electric-light peo
ple themselves. That the latter are en
tirely satisfied with and approve of its
work is proven by the fact that it is
the meter that is now in general use in
this city: that they are also fully aware
of its larcenous proclivities is borne out I
by the alacrity with which they make
restitution whenever the culprit is de
tected.
Inquiry among consumers of electrici- j
ty show that there have been many \
such detections of late.
Herewith is given an illustration of
the mechanism of the Thomson watt
meter, together with the meter as it
appears inclosed in its metallic case.
The technical description accompany
ing the drawing is taken from Mr. Ses
sions' article in the Journal <;f Elec
tricity of last August. A watt is the
unit of electricity and charges are made
by the thousand watts.
Yesterday a Call reporter was given
a practical illustration of how easily a
meter may become susceptible to out
side influences. Upon this subject Mr.
Sessions says, again quoting from his
THOMPSON RECORDING WATT METER.
H. N. SESSIONS, the Expert Electrician, Describes the
Meter That Is in General Use in This City as
Follows :
The motor may be described as being a shunt motor, having very low re
sistance fields which are connected in series with the lights or power to be
used. The armature circuit of very high resistance is connected straight
across the service mains, and provided the potential does not change, the
armature strength remains constant. The speed of the meter depends upon
the strength of the fields, which in turn is in proportion to the number of
lights or amount of power in series with them, or, in other words, on the
amperage traversing the field coils. The armature shaft revolves in a
vertical position, its weight resting on a lower jewel. A worm on the shaft
is meshed to a gear in connection with the series of gears which moves the
indicating hands. The speed of the meter is reduced by an inductive brake,
consisting of a copper disk carried by the armature shaft and revolving be
tween the poles of permanent magnets. These magnets may be shifted to or
from the center of the disk, thus decreasing or increasing trie leverage of
drag and regulating the speed.
The power absorbed by the disk by induction adjusts itself to any load
that the meter may be running on, because the amount of current induced
in the disk is in exact proportion to its speed. The friction on the jewels,
gearing and commutator of the moter is of sufficient amount to absorb a
large percentage of the power necessary to propel the meter on low loads.
Inasmuch as this percentage of power increases as the load decreases, the
meter is often very slow on light loads and sometimes stops on the smallest
loads. Steps have been taken to balance this friction by inserting within
the field of a starting coil of very fine wire connected in series with the
armature circuit; but, with the friction of the meter thus balanced, it very
often registers when no current is being used, especially when vibration is
met with.
After the meter has been carefully calibrated and balanced on light
loads, it will generally be found fast on heavy loads, where the friction that
gave so much trouble on light loads now enters as a very small factor.
There will be a point, however, between minimum and maximum loads,
where the meter will record correctly.
article in the Journal of Electricity:
"Any magnetic bodies, such as mo
tors, magnets or heavily loaded feeders, !
when placed at the sides of the meter,
will influence it by helping to diminish
or increase the strength of the fields
within, making it run fast or slow, or j
even backward, when no current is be- !
ing used. The permanent steel mag
nets which retard the motion of the
disk often lope their strength through I
aging, thus making the meter run fast, j
and on the other hand as the meter j
is not dust proof iron particles might
collect on the magnets and slow it
down.
"A very important feature which
causes a great deal of trouble is the
high resistance coil of fine wire in se
ries with the armature. In damp places,
owing to the difference of potential be- I
tween the turns and layers of this re- I
distance, sections of it often become!
short circuited, causing an increase of
current in the armature and again the I
meter is made to run fast. But if tcr>
great a section of the resistance should
be cut uut the amperage would rise be- I
yond the carrying capacity of the wire 1
j and result in burning out the resist- j
ance. This of course would open the
shunt circuit and cause the meter to
stop.
"it is impossible to balance the
friction of meters where there is vibra
tion, the reason being that the balanc
ing force remains the same, and with
vibraiion the amount of friction is
continually changine. Suppose the
meter to be standing still and bal
anced on no load. A vibration will
tend to remove the weight of the ar
mature shaft and disk from the lower
jewel, thus lighting and overbalancing
the friction and causing the meter to
register without using current. The
working parts of the meter give very
little trouble if cleaned regularly."
In some of the tests The Call re
porter witnessed -an ordinary magnet
was used. One pole of this magnet
when brought close to the meter would
increase the resistance on the copper
disk and perceptibly retaijd its speed.
In fact, when the current was reduced,
it brought it to a full stop, and when
the current was cut off entirely the
meter -was moved backward. On the
other hand, when the opposite pole
was placed nearest the meter the revo
lutions of the disk were materially in
creased.
Next an experiment was made with
one of the three magnets attached to
the meter. By moving the poles in
toward the center of the disk the
speed was increased, wnlle by pressing
them out toward the edge it was de
creased. Thus, an employe of a com
pany, were he so inclined, if sent to
test a meter in order to satisfy a con
3'imer as to its correctness, cuuld. upon
moving the metal case, surreptitiously
move one of the magnets out, and his
test would show that the meter was
slow and the company losing accord
ingly. Then, when he went to replace
the case, he could push the magnet
well in toward the center and the me
ter would fatten the company's divi
dends, while the hoodwinked victim
would mentally estimate what his bills
would be were the meter to register
accurately.
As magnetic power penetrates metal,
the case inclosing the meter offers no
protection, except from dust, and an
old file, a piece of pipe, or even a wire
properly charged and placed at a
proper distance from the meter would
aid in the robbery and its complicity
never be suspected by anybody but an
expert. In view of these influences.
Mr. Sessions closes his article with this
advice:
"In view of this discussion regard
ing the facts concerning electric me
ters, not only the makers and sellers
of electricity should inspect their me
ters, but, in many cases, it would
profit the consumers to have their me
ters independently exported. "
Mr. Sessions' advice to consumers is
resented by the companies furnishing
light and power in this city, as is
shown by their efforts to prevent such
tests being made. For instance, the
cases covering meters are fastened and
nobody but an employe of the company
is allowed to remove them. Experts
however, have ample means of making
tests without removing the cases. Even
the glass covering the aperture in the
case, through which the dials may be
seen is in many instances covered
over with paper so that the amount
registered cannot be read except by re
moving the case. Were the meters any
where near accurate and the companies
believed that the consumers were be
ing fairly treated there could be no pos
sible objection to the figures being seen,
or even tests being made by independ
ent experts.
But the consumers, or many of them,
have awakened to the fact that they
are being "held up" by the meters for
the benefit of the companies, and ex
perts are being called upon by most of
the big merchants, hotel keepers, res
taurants and others to make independ
ent tests of meters. In some eases em
ployes of the companies are not per
mitted to test meters unless an expert
hired by the consumer is present.
The (ias Consumers' Association em
ploy* a staff of experts to test meters
for subscribers, and of all the meters
tested by that company 75 per cent,
roughly estimated, have been found to
register fast, or more watts than were
actually consumed, while the discrep
ancies varied from 3 per cent up, 20 per
cent fast having been not infrequently
discovered.
Three-fourths of the meters in use
based upon estimates of those tested,
are robbing the consumers! Those are
figures it would be well to ponder over
before you pay your next bill, unless
you have already had your meter ex
perted. The only way in which a con
sumer who has no knowledge of elec
tricity can form an estimate of the
amount he uses is to keep careful count
of the number of lamps and the length
of time each lamp burns. When the
lamps are new each one will consume
fifty watts an hour, which will enable
him to make a fairly accurate estimate
for the month. Old lamps, however,
consume considerably more electricity,
running as high as sixty-two watts an
hour. This is due to the greater re
sistance of the old carbons, so that at
best such estimates are unsatisfactory.
But the day of reckoning with the
companies has arrived, and already
they have been forced to disgorge a con
siderable portion of their loot. This
they have done in most instances with
promptness, when called upon, desiring
only that a settlement be effected as
quietly as possible. In some cases,
though, it has been shown that the
companies are not willing to pay the
full amount demanded, and lawsuits
may result. A call upon a number of
business men yesterday resulted in the
information thnt all were fully im
pressed with the importance of hiring
their own experts. Only one of those
seen, Mr. Frledlander of the Columbia,
Baldwin and California theaters, ap
peared to be at all satisfied with the
nent hi' had received, and he at
tributed this to the fact that he em
ploys an export electrician constantly
who watches his interests carefully. In
this. Mr. ?'ri<'dlnndor is in the same
position as the Palace Hotel manage
ment, and. like the latter, has found
the company prompt to allow any re
bate claimed. Rut Friedlander. Gottlob
& Co.. neaci to the Palace Hotel, are
probably the largest consumers in
town, their bills for the three theaters
amounting to ?25,000 a year in round
numbers, and it pays them to keep an
export on their regular pay-roll, as it
prevents in a large measure any at
tempt at overcharge and insures
prompt settlement of their claims.
With smaller consumers it is different.
George Raphael of the clothing firm
of Raphael Bros, said he had experi
enced much trouble with the electric
light company. The meters that had
been in use for years were tested last
fall and found to be running very fast.
He made an estimate of the amount
paid in excess of the proper sum, cover
ing a period of several years, and pre
sented the statement to the company.
The latter expressed a willingness to
make what it considered proper restitu
tion, but considered Mr. Raphael's esti
mate far too high. Finally Mr. Ra
phael thought it better to compromise
than to carry his claim into court, and
accepted a material reduction on his
claim. He asserted that his estimate
was correct, and charged the company
with dealing unfairly with him. He
now has his meters tested regularly.
The White House has a heavy claim
ri gainst the company for overcharges,
extending over a number of years, but
Mr. Weill's manager did not care to
discuss it. as the company refused to
&UOW the full amount and the matter
might terminate in a lawsuit. He said
that at a later period, however, he
might have something very interesting
to say on the subject.
Newman & "Levison called in an ex
pert to test their meter last fall, and
upon his report that it was registering
fast they presented a claim to the com
pany, w hich, being for a comparatively
small amount, was allowed without
protest. Consequently that Prm has no
soriouf complaint to make, but it has
its meter tested regularly just the
same.
Nathan, Dohrmann & Co., Wilson's
Restaurant and Kohlberg, Frohling &
Co. are among other downtown con
cerns that have had or are now having
trouble over the meters supplied them.
J. J. O'Brien & Co. have only recently
had their suspicions aroused and are
now making investigation. What the
result will be they do not care to specu
late on just now.
And there are others.
CHARLES HANSON
PASSES AWAY
Dies at His Home on Van
Ness Avenue Rather
Suddenly.
Came Hero When He Was Eighteen
Years Old and Went Into the
Lumber Trade.
Charles Hanson, the millionaire mill
owner and lumber dealer, died at his
home, 12U8 Van Ness avenue, yesterday
morning.
The deceased was born in Denmark on
September 21, 1533, and came to San Fran
cisco when he was 18 years old. He at
once went Into the lumber business, and
has remained in it ever since. He first
went to work on the Umpqua River, but
later went to Tacoma, where in istiG lie
built, at what is now known as old Ta
coma, the first sawmill erected in that
section. In ISS4 the milling firm was in
corporated and is now known as the
Tacoma Sawmill Company. During the
Frazer River excitement Mr. Hanson
made a big stake. He had a corner in
shingles and made immense profits out
of the deal.
Charles Hanson was a large stockhold
er in the Puget Sound Tugboat Company,
the San Francisco Lumber Company, the
Pacific Pine Lumber Company, Puget
Sound Lumber Company, Tacoma Mill
Company and several other local con
cerns. He owned the barks Dashing
Wave and Tidal Wave, besides being in
terested in a whole fleet of coasters.
The deceased leaves a widow and one
son, Charles Hanson Jr., who is at pres
ent the resident manager of the Tacoma
Mill Company. Mr. Hanson has suffered
on and off for several years, but was not
confined to his home until about three
weeks ago. He died from Bright's dis
ease of the kidneys.

A Little Good Advice Which You Will Do
Well to Consider at This Time.
At this time of year, when we are
i changing over from winter to spring.
i there is always a low order of vitalityâ
\ a reaction from the strains of the sea-
; sons. The blood does not flow so full
! or so rapidlyâ the strength is less.
For these reasons all kinds of diseases
have a much better chance than at any
j other season. "We all know this from our
| own experiences and those of our friends,
I and we are aware what a terrible amount
|of grip, pneumonia and other diseases
! there is floating in the air and drawn in
!by us with every breath. It is a time
I for exercising special care, for keeping
j the blood in circulation and the system
i toned up generally.
I There is but one way by which a proper
I reaction, at such a time, can be brought
about and that is by the use of a pure
stimulant, preferably whisky. This is
universally admitted, but the trouble has
I been to secure a good, pure and reliable
whisky. Indeed, there Is but one that
i can be confldentlv and certainly recom-
mended for this "purpose and that is
Duffy's Pure Malt. It possesses qualities
known only to itself. It will bring about
I a reaction, cause the "blood to circulate.
I prevent a cold, chei-k pneumonia and
i w*ard off grip. It has relieved more suf-
fering and saved more lives by reason
; of these powers which It possesses than
anything of a similar nature which has
ever been discovered. You will t>e wisa
1 if you have it on hand and use It when-
ever you feel the least signs of disease oi
weakening.

ROLLED HER
MASTS OUT
The French Bark Alice
Suffered in a Cape
Horn Storm.
Two Close Races Between Sail
ing Vessels That Left Here
in October.
Alter Getting Out of the Tiburon La
goon the Will o' the Wisp
Went Ashore.
The new French bark Alice, whlcÃ ar
rived from Swansea yesterday, had v pe
culiar experience while rounding the
Horn. While hove-to under two lower
topsails tii' 1 backstays parted and the
fore and main topgallant masts, with
everyuilng attached, went by the board.
It happened i>n December 31 last, in lati
tude 66 10 south, longitude 7t> f>o west. A
heavy gate was encountered, which lasted
ten days, and everybody <>n boaru hail
a terrible time of it. The bark was hove
to, and nearly every roll Bhe dipped her
Into the water. The strain on the
vessel's rigging was enormous, and in
spite of ihe fact that the vessel was on
her maiden voyage and everything \y;ls
brand new, the backstays could not stiuid
thf pressure, and the !">s of tin- spars
was the rosuit. The captain Bays that
considering the way the vessel was roll
-'..â  escaped easily, and it w;is lucky
that the fore and main masts did not go
by the board.
On Oecember 18, E. Paltonche, the
A a cook, died from natural causes,
and was buried at sea. The Alice is a
very handsome craft* and Is the finest
vessel flying the French ilag that has
come in to this port in many a day.
A couple of very interesting ocean races
have Just been completed, and in one
Instance the linisii was very close. The
British bark Olivebank, with a cargo of
wheat, valued i I . . and the British
ship Pinmore, with a similar cargo, val
ued at $119, . from San Francisco
for Great Britain on Oi tob< r 27 last, while
twenty-four hours later the British ship
Drumalis, with a wheat cargo valued at
JLJS.OOo, sailed. The Olivebank arrived at
her destination on the 17th hist., while
the Drumalis arrived a day later. When
it came down to actual figuring there
were only a couple of hours" difference
between the two vessels. The Plnmore
was beaten a day by botti vessels.
The second race started several days
after the three-cornered one. The Moel
Ellian, Salvatore Ciampa and [nchcape
Rock left together on -November 4 last,
the Cavaliere Ciampa and Anaurus
Bailed on November E and the Aberfoyle

FROM VAUDEVILLE TO LEGITIMATE COMEDY.
Ferris Hartman Will Appear at the Baldwin in a
New Role.
If Ferris Hartman ever writes an autobiography he will certainly devote
a Feparate and distinct chapter to his new adventure in histrionic art,
that cf a legitimate comedian in co . .-;., :â -. is affected by Joe Hol
land. On April 25 Ferris will appea â¢ :it the Baldwin In the title role of
"The Purser." an Kng-lish comedy which has run through the provinces
a.nd was successfully produced at the Strand Theater, London.
Hartman lias been rather protean In liis stage <-fforts. At first he started
his theatrical career as an actor In strung melodrama, then he lost some of
his heavy seriousness and delved for a lighter but more productive rein.
He found it in comic and burlesque opera. At the Tivoli. where Hartman
relpnec! supreme for several years, doing: much to draw the smiles and pro
voke the laughter of a generous audience night after nlpht, he played
Innumerable parts. He ran the gamut from Rip Van Winkle to Tommy
Nothing in Miss Frisco, warbling topical songs when necessary and clinging
to straight parts when the stage manager forbade a departure from the
role as written. After his long engagement there, the favorite of the Tiv
oli patrons ireni ESast and appeared In vaudeville. His success in this line
was not astounding, so Hartman crossed the ''pond" to capture the Ang
lians. In England h<> secured the play In which he will appear at the Bald
win for the lirst time.
Before leaving America Hartman signed a contract for five years with
George Bowli s. one of the most popular theatrical men In America. Bowles
is to star Hartman and the process will begin In this city late in April.
The play In which Hartman will make his debut as a straight comedian
offers many opportunities for the versatile actor. The entire action is laid
on boanl an ocean steamer. There are three nets, with three changes of
seen< â the first on the deck, the second In the dining room, the third in
ih.- salon. The situations are said to be very funny and at the same time
natural.
The Purser, the role which Hartman will essay, is returning from a
voyage to Australia. On the ship Is a beautiful and wealthy woman
whose married life has not been a sea of happiness and a round of pleas
ure. She fancies the purser, and In their confidential talks he recommends
the divorce courts as a solution of her difficulties. She imagines that an
immediate union with the purser will follow the divorce, but the latter had
no such thoughts. He loves a young London girl, and upon his arrival
marries her. Just after this eveni he is ordered to return, and is placed
in a quandary on account of the law of the company, which prohibits offi
cers of the steamers to lie accompanied on voyages by their wives. The
purser's wife ships as a passenger and the divorcee also. Then the fun
begins. The wife, posing as an unmarried female, evokes the erotic pas
sion in the breasts of the ship's captain, the ship's doctor and two young
men On a pleasure trip to Australia. The plot thickens in many knots, evi
dently inextricable, but the solution comes in time and there is the usual
pairing off for the denouement. Â«
Whether Ferris Hartman will make a success of this new venture or
not, a San Francisco audience will be the first to pass judgment. Hart
man is now in New York, which place he will soon leave for this city to
organize his company and prepare for rehearsals.
ROLLING HER TOPGALLANT MASTS OUT.
The new French bark Alice was caught In a storm off Cape Horn. A tremendous sea was running, and It was
blowing a gale. Captain Gosse hove the vessel to under two lower topsails, but she rolled and strained so that the
backstays parted and the fore and main topgallant masts with all attachments went by the board.
March 17. The Salvatore Clampa's run
of 113 days is the record run this year.
The yacht Will o' the Wisp will have
to go on the ways for repairs before she
can go Into commission. After coming
out of retirement in the Tlbnron basin
last Sunday she went to Sausallto and
moored near the marine boathouse. The
wind took command of her during the
night, and she went ashore, knocking a
big hole in her side. She will be fixed up
and ready fur opening day without any
trouble.
"Charley" Webster, clerk of the steam
er McDowell, Is a. great lover of cats, and
his office on Clay-street wharf is never
without three or four of them. Last
Saturday his favorite, tabby showed him
with motherly pride a litter of kittens,
in which were two freaks. One of the
little, animals, which Charley christen.il
Cuba, had two tails and the other, with
live legs, he called Captain Sigsbee. The
freaks lived until noon yesterday.
In-. H. 11. Thompson, who has made
himself so popular at the Harbor Re
ceiving Hospital, through his courteous
and skillful services, has severed his con
nection with thai institution. He goes
to San nfateo to take over the practice of
l>r. I*. Thomas, who loaves for Europe In
a few days for a two years' stay. Dr. C.
H Lowe-11 will fill the vacancy caused by
the resignation of Dr. Thompson.
Courtland F. Drum, port steward of the
California Navigation and Improvement
Company, died at his home on Glover
street lasÂ»t Sunday. The dece&Â£< d was for
a quarter of a century with the Naviga
tion Company, and was known to almost
every traveler on the company's river
steamers.
THE SAW/. FT? A^CTSCO CAIX, TUESDAY, MARCH 22, 1895. .
RACING MAY YET
BE CARRIED ON
Supervisors Do Not Pass
the Order Restrict
ing It
Clinton's Measure Is Found to
Be in Many Respects
Defective.
A Special Committee Will Have a
Chance to Amendâ Smith
Oljeets.
The Board of Supervisors dodged the Is
sue on the race track proposition yes- !
terday by referring the matter back to
the special committee to which the ques
tion of restricting racing was originally
intrusted.
The matter came up under the report
of the committee, which consisted of .
Supervisors Clinton, Rivers and Smith.
The two former tiled a report recommend- '-
ing that the board pass an ordinance re
stricting racing to forty-eight days In
each year. The third member of the com
mittee filed a. sharp minority report In â 
which he said that if racing was the cry- |
ing evil claimed by Supervisors Clinton
and Rivera it should be stopped entirely
â not simply restricted to a certain num
ber of days.
He was satisfied, he said, to have three
monuis of racing, but thought this was ,
little enough to give the horse breeders
of me State a chance on their Invest- ;
ments.
Supervisor Clintoa aaid that President
Androus of the Pacific Coast Jockey Club !
had called on him and stated that a job
had been put up to injure the ;lub, and
that tne proposed ordinance would work
a great hardship on those who had in
vested their money in the lngleside track.
Supervisors Smith and /Rottanzi both i
said that if there was any joker in the
matter they wanted, to see it Investigated,
and favored referring the order back to
the committee.
Further discussion developed the fact
that the ordinance proposed by Dr. Clin
ton is fatally defective in many points,
and is was finally decided to give tile
committee another chance . to properly
amend the ordinance before putting it ;
to a final test of the vote of the board.
it is thought that the restriction on :
ladies' day will be eliminated, legal advice
being to the effect that such a regula
tion cannot be carried out.
The report of the special committee was
placed on file. It is probable that the i
ordinance, when placed in proper legal â¢
form, will be accepted and passed by the
board.
Supervisor Haskins introduced a reso
lution that was adopted requiring Tax
Collector Block to furnish specifications j
for the publication of the delinquent tax
list for the year ISS7.
it was decided to instruct Attorney Wil- â 
lett to take an appeal to the Supreme
Court in the case of the city against the
California Hotel.- Willett is intrusted
With the collection of delinquent taxes
and recently sued the hotel, the city los
ing its case on technicality.
A resolution was introduced by Super
visor Delany, and passed, instructing the
clerk of the board to advertise for pro
posals for the burial of the indigent uead
lor the year beginning July l.
The Siayor was empowered by resolu
tion to examine Into the matter of the
County Clerk's employes ana, if neces
sary, to call upon City and County At
torney Crt-swell to determine whether or
not all of the appointments of Mr. Curry
are legal.

Hypnotic Wonders.
No one need go to Paris now to see all that
is marvelous In hypnotism. In the hypnotic
wards of many hospitals of this country are
hypnotic subjects that a mere glance. It is
said, throws them into the trance state. But
in order to overcome that obstinate kidney
trouble, the persistent use of Hostetter's Stom
ach Hitters is necessary. I'se it also system
atically for malarial, bilious, dyspeptic, rheu
matic and nervous diseases.

mend Ripans Tabules and to give his own experience with them, which

j asthmatic. As a general thing throughout the winter, I have to re-
main indoors at least three or four days in each month. I have suf-
fered a great â yet all the precautions I might take did not keep
me free from these terrible attacks. About eighteen months ago I
commenced taking RIPANS TABULES to regulate my stomach. I
am of a bilious temperament, and as soon as I become bilious I am
sure to have attacks of asthma. The Tabules keeps my stomach all
right, and for the past year I have not been confined to the house at
all. My asthma is not cured â but the attacks are very slight. I_uso
on an average two Tabules every Sunday, one on Wednesda: ana ono

The Governor of Penn
sylvania Arrives in
the City.
Members of the Union League
Club Extend a Cordial
Welcome.
Addresses Are Made by Prominent
Men of the City and the
State.
Governor Daniel H. Hastings of Penn
sylvania was tendered a reception by the
members of the Union League Club last
night at their headquarters in the Pal
ace Hotel. Prominent men in nearly
. very profession were in attendance and
many made short addresses in honor of
iho occasion, among them being United
B Oator White and Attorney-Gen
( ral McCormiek of Pennsylvania, The
"hi California hospitality was in evt
aad every effort was made to give
the chief executive of the "Keystone
State" an appropriate and cordial wel
come.
The prevailing remarks on the
subject of the imminent hostili
ties that are rapidly approaching between
this country and Spain were elo
quent appeals t.. the citizens of the
?Â°H ntr L tv s ''tnd together despite polit
ical affiliations to meet the impending
war with the "don."
Tirvy L. Kurd delivered the opening re
marks, which were as follows:
The Union League Clu*b desires me to extend
to you its sincere and hearty welcome and to
assure you of the great pleasure afforded its
members by your presence with us this even-
Ing. Though far removed from the historic
state or whose government you form so con
spicuous a part. 1 can assure you that our
hearts beat in Unison with yours in 'reverence
for the principles and policies that have made
our nation great and to which the Union
League club stands firmly and irrevocably
pledged. . -
But not alone as Republicans do the mem
bers of the Union League Club extend their
welcome, but rather as Californians who love
their State and who would have you know her
people and see and appreciate the beauties and
advantages that are peculiarly her own. As a
member of the great sisterhood of States Cali
fornia is still young, and yet her history is
replete with stirring incidents since Cabrillo
anchored his ships in the harbor of San Diego,
only fifty years after the discovery of America
by Columbus. We have no Independence Hall
or Gettysburg, but we have the mines of pre
cious metals that stood as a bulwark against
the waning, credit of an imperiled nation, a
truitfur soil teeming With all that makes a
great and prosperous State, with climate and
scenery unrivaled elsewhere on the globe. But,
above all this, with a proud and patriotic peo
ple. California stands guard at the western
gate and is ready at a moment's call to join
your own beloved Pennsylvania in defending
our nation's Hag and our nation's honor
wherever and whenever assailed.
It is not my purpose at this time to do
more than extend to you a welcome which I
can assure you is most cordial and sincere. I
cannot retrain, however, from taking advant
age of your presence to indicate to you, and,
through you to our political brethren of the
East, the supreme confidence felt by the Re
publicans of California in the administration
at "Washington, and their unbounded faith in
the ability of our President to guide our nation
safely through the perils with which she has
been so suddenly confronted.
CHAMPIONS DEFEATED.
Santa Clara Administers a Defeat to
the Clever California Market
Baseball Nine.
After downing the representatives of
Berkeley and Stanford, the crack Santa
Clara baseball aggregation tried its mettle
against the California Markets at Santa
Clara, a few days ago, with surprising
vrsultsr.*
They not only defeated the tournament
winners of last season, but proved their
right to be classed as one of the lead
ing teams of the State.
Although strengthened by two ex-Na
tional League players, Mertes and "Josh"
Eiielly, the Markets were outplayed, the
college team winning on their merits.
Rielly, Murphy and Mertes were the
jL ght lights on the local team, while the
&st individual work for Santa Clara -was
{.one by Taber.
Iberg and Kelly shared in the pitching
honors. Both men twirling in excellent
form. .'i
The game was played in remarkably
fast time, and created great enthusiasm
in the large crowd present. Following
is the score:

COOK ACQUITTED.
The Market - Street Officer Repri-
manded by the Police Com
missioners.
Police Officer James Cook was before
the Police Commissioners last night,
charged with ill-treating Frank Bond, a
clerk in a South-of-I^arket-street lodging
house. Cook had a warrant for Bond's
arrest on a charge of battery, and as the
latter did not want to be taken to the
City Prison, he *aye ti.e officer $40 as
bail. After leaving the place Cook was
Incensed at the remarks of some men
who were not friendly to B< i. and, evi

worst of it." as he exprefe-' . it. he re
turned to Bond's room, and, after drag
ging him out of bed. made him dress htm
selt He then took him to the nearest
patrol-box and rang in for the wagon.
After its arrival Bond was placed in it
and taken to the City Prison, where h.
was formally charged. Thinking that the
officer had exceeded his duty. Bond pre
ferred charges against him. l^ast night
the case came up before the Commission
ers, and as Bond pleaded that the officer
was not in blame De asked that the case
against him oe dismissed. After repri
manding him for his conduct, the Com
missioners dismissed the charge against
the officious policeman. It was decided
to postpone the appointment of a succes
sor to ex-Sergeant Davis until the. next
meeting.
DEATH DUE TO WHISKY.
An Autopsy Reveals the Fact That
Gaddis was Not Murdered.
The autopsy which was held yesterday
on the body of J. S. Gaddis. who died at
the Harbor Receiving Hospital on Satur
day night, completely upset the theory
of the poiice that the man had been mur
dered. Dr. Gallagher found that death
\v,s due to cerebral congestion, brought
on by the habitual use of liquor. The
only injuries to the man's head were the
lacerated wounds on the face. The doc
tor could find no fractured saull. which
was reported to have been the cause of
Gaddis' death, an,. Dr. (iallapncr pave it
as his opinion that any blow the man
might have received on has face or head
had nothing to do with the fatality.
Death of Two Noted Sportsmen.
L,ast Friday William Remfree of An
tioch died in this city of Bright' a dis
ease of the kidneys, and yesterday his
eldest son. W. J. Remfree. died in An
tioch The father and son were well
and favorably known to many of the
local sportsmen, who will learn with re
gret of their untimely demise.
WITHOUT HIM
IT COULD NOT BE
Colonel "Procession" Robinson
Will Head the Stars of
the New League.
A Great Season of Baseball Arranged
by the California League.
Schedule of Games.
When Colonel "Procession" Robinson
heads the opening parade of the new
California League on Saturday next, the
small boy and. in fact, people of ail ages
should be on the lookout for him. Seat
ed in the first carriage guarding a $100
trophy, which will be contested for by
the six teams, the doughty colonel will
head a regiment of the brawn and mus
cle of what constitutes the new league.
As music has always been a pleasing
feature of the colonel's openings, it will
not be omitted on this occasion, as two
leading bands have been engaged. The
parade will wend its way through all the
important streets, so as to give every
one an opportunity to gaze on the
colonel's beaming countenance and on his
galaxy of stars, who have made names
for themselves on the diamond in sea
sons gone by, and who will very likely
be heard from in the present series.
All the orphan asylums of this city
have received an invitation to attend the
opening game.
Games will be played every Saturday
and Sunday in the important cities of the
State, and 2Â»2 per cent of the gate re
ceipts of each game will be placed in the
Anglo-Californian Kank to form a fund
to be divided among the thrto teams
holding the highest percentage at the
end of the season.
Following is the schedule decided on
by the league and as it will be carried

THE SA^ FB-ANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAECH 22, 189 S.
OPPOSED TO
THE BOULEVARD
Meeting of Bush-Street
Property Owners Not
Favoring the Job.
The Hand of the Sutter-Street
Railroad Company Said to
Be at the Helm.
Resolutions Adopted Condemning the
Proposed Action of the Supervisors
and Against Its Passage.
A meeting of indignant property-owners
was held at Uie Wentworth Hotel, 6f7
Bush street, last night for the rturpose
of entering a tlnal protest against making
a boulevard of Bush street. The owners
of real estate on Bush street assemoled
on short notice to take suitable action
against what they characterized one of
the greatest farces of the closing century.
Among those present, all ot whom are
property-owners were: Dr. J. F. Shiels,
E. Peterson, J. W. Manning, Robert
White, P. T. Martin, Mrs. M. W. New
man, Mrs. Alma E. Keith, James M. Tay
lor, A. S. Baldwin, G. K. Hilton, Dr. S.
M. Mouser, Frank Maxson, John Miller,
John Donnelly, Edward Patridge, Dr.
Lohsen, Colonel P. Boland, Mrs. Ij. M.
Higlow, Mrs. Catherine Broad, mrs. Mary
McKeman, Mrs. Margaret Barr, Mrs. Â±ie
becca Carson, J. M. Costello, J. Hanlon,
Mrs. J. D. Feldbus.!, Mrs. E. Peterson,
J. B. Keesing ariu Irs. A. F. Asher.
The meeting was called to order by J.
M. Taylor, and on motion Dr. J. F. Shiels
was \.it<d to the coair and Colonel P-,
Boland was elected secretary.
bu&rp and pointed speeches opposing
the plan of making a boulevard of the
street were made by Mrs. Mary W. New
man; a large property-owner and pioneer
lady of the city, Mrs. Alma E. Keitn; P.
J. Martin, Montell Taylor, J. Hanlon, M.
J. Manning, Dr. Mouser and others. It
was bad enough, they agreed, to have a
ghost ear line ambulating past their doors
tor years, thereby retarding the prospects
of the street and tending to depreciate
the value of property, it was said ihat
Lucre are two men who own property on
tiie street who are aiding- the Sutter
street company to make the street a
boulevard, so that no other street rail
way company can ever get a franchise on
it. 'ihese two were named as Mr. HooKer
and Â»v . B. Bradbury, both of whom, it
Is charged, are stockholders of the Sutter
street company.
Resolutions objecting to the boulevard
scheme were adopted, and the secretary
and president appointed as a committee
to present them at a meeting of the
Street Committee on -hursday.
By a vote, it was decided to have every
member of those present appear before
the committee and also before the full
board at their meetings, and by this
means convince the Supervisors that tne
property-owners are determined to op
pose the boulevard scheme tooth and
nail, even to going into court if neces
sary.
Imposed on a Woman.
A well-dressed middle-aged man visited
the lodging-house at 818 Jessie street last
night and pretended to be anxious to rent
a room. He claimed he was a mining
man, and. after selcctlng'-a room, he gave
Mrs. Hoffman, the proprietoress a $5 Con
federate bin. She gave him $4 in change,
and he at once disappeared. A friend
who happened to be in the house at the
time informed Mrs. Hoffman that the
bÂ»il was valueless,- and she notified Cap
tain Spillane. The man was described
as being about 20 years of age, rather
tall and had a light mustache. He was
dressed in â  a dark" suit of. clothes and
wore a silk hat. From the description
given of him, the police are convinced
that he is the same man who recently
passed several Confederate bills on un
suspecting storekeepers in the Mission.
Lost in a Crowd.
\V. H. Craig, aged .77, a recent arrival
j from Rochester, N. V., is among the
i missing. li> v.a.~ stopping at the Palace
Hotel, and last night his daughter accom
; panied him to tne ferry, intending to
i catch the Sunset limited. In some way
she became separated from him, ana,
on account of his age, she fears some
thing may have happened to him. Last
night she reported his disappearance to
the police. He is described as being
âº; leei tail, weighs about 225 pounds and is
well dressed.
Customs Storekeepers Changed.
Assistant storekeepers of customs will
be shifted on the Ist of April, as fol
lows: J. J. Kelly from the seawall ware
house to the Greenwich; Joseph H. Sta
pleton from the Greenwich to the Val
lejo; C. J. Comyns from the Vallejo to
the Atlantic; George I*. Clough from the
Broadway to the seawall; J. G. Ueatty
from the Atlantic to the Oriental, ant!
B. F. Murphy from the Oriental to the
Broadway.
Wants the Judgment Set Aside.
James McCoy, a street contractor, com
menced suit yesterday against Joseph
Wells and John M. Hooper to have a
judgment for $6732 64 against him set
aside on the ground that it was procured
by â¢ fraud: j McCoy, claims that he was
not given" proper notice and did not have
an opportunity to present his defense.
THE SLAYER OF PRESIDENT BARRIOS
OSCAR ZOLLINGER, Who Avenged the Death of His
EmDlouer,
Senor de Las Rivas of this city has just received the accompanying pho
tograph of Oscar Zollinger, the man who put to death the President of the
Guatemalan republic, to avenge the death of Juan Aparicio, a wealthy
planter, who was formerly the assassin's employer. It is the first authen
tic picture of the murderer received in this country. Senor Rivas' corre
spondent writes that since the murder <>f Barrios peace has reigned in
Guatemala, and Pnrrios' successor, President Cabrera, t<> whom the writer
pays a high tribute, gives promise of uniting the opposing factions and es
tablishing harmony throughout the land.
THE BLACK WILL
MEET THE WHITE
Peter Jackson and Jim Jeffries
"Will Perform This
Evening.
Betting Ffcvors the Los Angeles
Heavyweight, Who Has Youth
and Strength.
This evening the sporting fraternity of
this city will witness a great treat in
fisticuffs at Woodward's Pavilion.
Apart from a ten-round contest be
tween two clever youngsters, the patrons
of the ring will have the pleasure of see
ing the great master of "the manly art"
in a contest of twenty rounds against the
powerful and fairly scientific Jim Jeffries
of Southern California.
The contest in a nutshell; will be a
game- of hit anil miss between a general
who has undermined hiÂ» constitution and
a young and powerful athlete who has
still much to glean in the art of self-de
fense.
Peter Jackson is undoubtedly a pol
ished artist. He thoroughly understands
every point of the game and as a matter
of fact he can rest himself in battle when
his opponent is exerting every muscle in
his body with the object of attaining- a
certain end.
But be that as it may, the question at
issue is, can the clever Peter Jackson
baffle the attacks of the enemy and re
main on deck until the limit round is
called?
According to Jackson his young oppon
ent will be made to learn that experi
ence teaches. Jackson baa seen Jeffries
pertorm, and unless he funned a good
line on the lighting qualities of the pow
erful young man from I-os Angeles, it is
surmised that he would not consent to
meet him in a twenty-rouna contest.
Jackson will certainly lose prestige if
Jeffries BhouH whip him, and having
honor and reputation at stake, it is ex
tremely doubtful that the sensitive and
proud champion of England and the Aus
tralians would sign articles to fight any
man unless he thought that victory was
fairly certain.
Rather uian suffer a bad defeat the
friends of the colored champion contend
that Peter Jackson would retire from thc
business of prize-lighting and leave the
hard-earned honors he has achieved by
the power of his fists to be fought for
by those who are most entitled to the
distinction which he now attains, viz.,
champion of the old countries.
There is an old saying that "every dog
has his day," but the colored heavy
weight feels that he is still physically
able to accomplish a trick in a fistic c >m
petitkn against the best man extant,
notwithstanding that he has lived "off
the reel" since he whipped the hard
punching Slavin six years ago.
J.ickson has trained with the object of
Winning the contest this evening. He is
physically in tolerably good condition
ami his admirers expect t.> see him elec
trify the big heavy-weight, but Jeffries
and his warmest friends' smile when the
name of Jackson is mentioned, and in a
quit t way Hilly Delaney remarks:
"WeH, Jackson is a good fellow in a
social way, and 'has been" a great fight
er, but 'Peter the Great' has had one
right too many. On Tuesday evening we
will land him a member or the John L.
Sullivan army; viz., men who have seen
better days."
At CroWley & Raggett's poolrooms last
evening Jackson crawled up to aimost
even money, but his stock fell away per
ceptibly, and at 10 o'clock last evening
tin- betting- favored Jeffries, the pools
closing at 10 to 7. with Jackson on the
short end. In the Paris mutuals the bet
ting was as follows: Jackson, from 1 to
4, 11; 5 to 9. 24; 10 to 13, 50; 14 to 17, 58; 18
i i iiil iivcr. 114.
Jeffries, from 1 to 4, 13; 5 to 9, 32; 10 to
13. ;;7; 14 to 17. 46; IS and over, 107.
It was rumored last evening that if
Jarkson discovered early in the contest
that Jeffries was a harder game than he
expected he would fight with the object
of winning the match on points, which
he certainly can do unless the manager
of Jeffries sends his charge into the con
test with instructions to do or die.
Jeffries should certainly defeat Jack
son, all things considered, if he can ue in
duced to sail In and fight to win.
JAPS MUST GO.
Thirty-Three of the Brown Men Re-
fused a Landing by the Spe
cial Board.
Immigration Commissioner North and
the Specia) Board of Inquiry yesterday
refused a landing to thirty-three out of
the ninety-eight Japanese who arrived
recently by the China and the Doric.
The remaining sixty-five were allowed to
land.
The unlucky thirty-three claimed to be
farmers, visiting California for the pur
pose of studying agricultureâ rice culture
for instanceâ by walking from farm to
to farm and watching the Californian
farmer raise cotton, rice, jute, opium,
sugar cane, silkworms, etc. None of the
new arrivals had more than $M in cash
and the board and the Commissioner were
convinced that the thirty-three were cool
ies and had come hither under labor con
tracts. Their blankets and clothing had
been supplied by the same firm In Yoko
hama, and they all hailed from the same
district.
Convicted of Criminal Libel.
"William Miller, an ex-convict, was con
victed by a jury in Judge Dunne's court
yesterday on a charge of having pub
lished a libolous article in the "Illustrat
ed World" concerning Jane W. Hruner
a lodging house keeper. Miller, who
served a term "across the hay" for burg
lary, is also under sentnee in Santa Clara
County for the publication of other libel
ous articles.

HOW KENNEDY
WON HIS BET
Tern Peasley Plays the Tramp
in Real Life and Is a
Success. \
The Knight of V the Road, in
"1492," Receives Cold .â 
Treatment"
.. â¢ . . . â¢â¢â  . . â  -
Tom Peasley is a tramp ana there is
no mistaking it. In the show and out
of the show ho meets with equal success
when he dons the raiment of the knights
of the dusty roads. Last night after the
curtain dropped on the first performance
of "1492" at the Columbia, Pe'asley re
ceived word from P. J. Kennedy, his man
ager, that he was not to change his tramp
costume. , A bet was 'â â  made between Ken
nedy and a friend that Peasley could not
so fur merge his identity in his clothes
and makeup as to be taken for a genu
ine tramp. The test was made last night
with the utmost success, and Kennedy
came in for first money.
Peasley, in his regular, tramp costume,
but with his face unadorned by the close
cropped roseate whiskers he wears on the
stage,, drifted into the Columbia cafe
about 11:30. He fell upon the lunch coun
ter like a hound upon a hare. On one
plate he piled crab salad, enchiladas, cold
meat and olives, all of which he devoured
with supreme gusto. Si Green took chills
at sight of this voracious avalanche, and
had hardly breath left to order one of
his barkeepers to eject the tramp. The
bar was crowded at the time, and some
generously inclined youth shouted out to
bring the fellow in for a drink, but his
words were unheeded and Peasley went
the way of the outcast.
From the Columbia the guileful tramp
walked over to ti,e Baldwin, sauntered in
to the lobby and asked for a room with
bath attached. The clerks displayed a
surprise that does not usually mar their
impassive countenances. Peasley's shirt
was striped black and white. A keen ob
server in the crowd wanted to know who
the tramp was with a "con's" shirt.
Neither lodging nor board was for Peas
ley in his stage effects. Escorted by the
clerk he left the building with impreca
tions on his lips about the charity of the
rich.
Up Powell street he stopped men and
women, his plea being thirst and hunger.
The cold shoulder of humanity was all
he got â with one exception Ãogie O'Don
nell wanted to buy him a drink.

XEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. March 21.â The only feature
discernible in to-day's stock market was its
dullness. The dullness wan the exact reflec
tion, however, of the doubt and hesitation
which prevail In alf financial circles over the
n<>xt probable development in the Cuban ques
tion. Apparently there was a limited volume
of sales fur the snort account at the start,
which resulted in sharp declines to practically
the low point of the day. There were lower
prices made In some few stocks later In the
aimless drifting of the market. Business was,
however, almost stagnant after the opening
until near the close, when there was a sharp
rally In prices. apparently due to the re
buying of stocks sold at the opening. There
was no spirit <t animation in the rally and
prices drifted downward again at the close.
There was only a small volume of stocks of
fering all day, hut the demand was almost
nothing and the result is that the prices are
lower all around, losses reaching a point In
some of the leading specialties. There Is
every indiration of a large outstanding short
Interest In the market, but in the presence of
the possibilities in the political outlook this
Interest Is very persistent in declining to
COVeT. It Is the privilege belief that the early
developments at Washington will include the
report of the Maine Board of Inquiry and a
President's message on that and Cuba, This
kerps purchasers out of the market and on
the other hand the larpe short Interest warns
r 11Â»1 1Â»- b--jirs to proceed with caution. The con-
Hifjui-nce Is semi-stagnation, such as was wit
nessed to-day. Bach selling as there was was
uttrlbuted to Washington account and there
was some selling also by large individual
operators. London was a seller, but not to a
large extent. The list of Ftocks and bonds that
moved at all was a comparatively short one,
the market being too narrow. Foreign ex
cbsajre stiffened slightly to-day and no en
gagement was announced of gold for import.
Discounts in London and Berlin were reported
slightly easier. The outlook here favors easier
money on account of the gold Importations
jilread'- arrived or on the way. Banks are not
yet <:f posed to make time loans and great j
caution in the buying- of commercial paper Is
also manifest.
The bond market was on a corresponding
scale of dullness, while stocks and prices were
lower. Total saleÂ», $960,000. United States new
4s were % lower and the old 4s (registered) %
lower, while the old 4s (coupon) and seconds
were % higher bid.
The total sales of stocks to-day were 209.100

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, March 21.â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: The stock
markets here were lifeless and featureless to
day. Americans were stagnant and dull, pend
ing the report of the Maine disaster and the
disclosure of President McKinley's plans re
garding Cuba. Arbitrage houses took stock
when It was offered with fair margins, but
otherwise there was no support for Americans.
Spanish 4s were weak. Brazils were flat, the
exchange being the lowest on record. The In
dian budget was better than anticipated, pro
viding, as It does, for a net increase of only
Â£3,000,000 to the debt. Silver has risen sharp- !
ly because of the absence of any allusion to
the budget to an Increased port duty. The de- j
dine in French exchange is believed to be
partly due to sympathy with the fall of money
sales here, and partly to the fact that the Bank
of France is parting more freely with gold.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. March 21.â Wheat opened with a
continuation of the weakness which marked
the closing on Saturday. July starting about
%c lower at 84>^Â®S4Â»ic. Perhaps the chief ele
ment of weakness lay In the large receipts
here and In the Northwest. Chicago receipts
far overran expectations, 309 cars being: re
ported, of which number- 92 were of contract
grade. The weather bureau reported freezing
temperature in the Northwest and predicted
cold weather for the West, which, In view of
the recent rains and the totally unprotected
fields, aroused a good deal of apprehension
among shorts and " soon â  turned the market
from weakness to strength. After July had
advanced to SS&C a reaction set in which car
ried the price back to 85c, but -support by
prominent bull interests started covering again
and for two hours the market, though qu'et,
showed a good deal of strength. May fluctua
tions were apparently out of the paJe of regu
lar market' Influence. Opening prices of that
future were higher at $1 03@l 04. It sold
at once to $1 05 and did not get below $1 04
again during the session. The announcement
that Letter had contracted for the shipment of
1.000,000 bushels more of his Wheat to the
coast, all rail, and the belief In the early open-
Ing of lake traffic with the movement of 2.000.
000 bushels already loded In boats, gave the
market a strong undertone during the period
of dullness. The market continued strong un
til -within a few minutes of the close, when
general realizing set in. many of ,-, the early
buyers disposing of their lines. Support in a
general way was withdrawn and prices dropped
quickly. July had sold as hish as 85%&85& c

THE STOCK MARKET.
An advance in Sierra Nevada to $1 30 was
the only change of Importance In mining
stocks yesterday. Since the official letter from
that mine was written the upraise from the
Riley tunnel has reached a height of 36 feet,
and the whole tup is now in low grade ma
terial. The upraise will be continued up some
30 feet higher to a connection with the work
ings above before any further exploration of
the ore body will be made, as it is very neces
sary to secure the ventilation and other facili
ties which that connection will afford.
The Home Gold Mining Company of Nevada
County has levied an assessment of 5 cents
per share, delinquent April 19.
The sixth installment of the Oregon Im
provement assessment is called for payment
March 22.
The directors of the Alice Mining Company
of Montana have passed the dividend for
March, but one Is likely to be declared in
April.

j FASHIONS IN SKIRTS AND WAISTS
Fashionably made dress skirts, with
the exception of some tailor gowns, hang
separate from the linings, which rarely
measure more than four yards around.
For narrow silks and washable ma
terials, the best and newest skirt is the
seven-gore bell, which fits smoothly
across the front and hips and has a
graceful fullness at the back. It has
a dip in the back, which is given more
by the bias back seam than by the add
ed length at the bottom. In wide wool
materials the bell skirt with the wide
side gore is most used. It is graceful,
and does not cut into the material to
disadvantage. The Paquin skirt, with a
graduated circular flounce, is made, in
all sorts of materials, and will be much
used in lightweight wool goods, as well
as on the foulards, which are again to
the front in new designs. Rows of
graduated velvet run from the skirt
hem to the waist, and many have rows
of black insertion placed at Intervals
the entire depth of the skirt. Of course
drop linings are always used in these
gowns, and the outside is tacked in
places to the lining to prevent the net
from sagging and hanging below the
lining.
There is no getting around the fact
that the fancy odd waist will reign in
definitely. Perhaps the chiffon and
mousseline waists are the greatest fa
vorites, yet the fancy colored taffetas
and velvets, as well as all sorts of
silken weaves, are much worn. Blousy
fronts are still coming out daily in new
creations, which fact assures their
style as good for the coming season. â

Residents' Only Hope Is

Oakland O*nct Â«i.r. Francisco Call,
90S HroadÂ«-ay, March 2L
Much dissatisfaction is being expressed
by the residents of East Oakland at the
plan of the syndicate railroads to cut
them oiT from connection with any other
; art of town. A notice has been sent out
by the company that after March 31 the
operation of cars on the Fourth-avenue
line will be discontinuedâ and a dark
underline is beneath the "discontinued."
The line in question was opened about
four years ago, and was designed as an
element in the development of a large
;.ii at Trestle Glen. This
was taken up by the East Oakland road
in opposition to the attractions at Blair
i'ark, maintained by the Piedmont line.
A large pavilion was erected at the glen,
and about a week ago it was destroyed
by lire. During the summer many picnics
camp-meetings were held at the
glen, and a long stretch of very expensive
trestle was built across the ravine. Now
tlie whole project will be abandoned, as
the syndicate, having no opposition, can
divert all the summer pleasuring to Leona
iieights or Blair Park.
The Fourth-avenue line is over a mile
li'iig. and no other road runs near the
oed neighborhood. The syndicate
states that it will not maintain a road
ihat steiuiily loses $b a day, and some of
the property-holders have asked that tne
tracks remain, until the territory shall
â iop.
A very interesting point that has arisen
in this connection is the fact that Trestle
Glen is a part of what is known as the
Sather tract, which has been offered
to the city for sale as a park site, if
the Realty Syndicate, which owns the
railroads, is not the direel agent for the
Satner property, it nas a large interest
in it, as is proved by its offer of a big
strip of land in the event of the city
purchasing the par*, site that could con
the Sather property with the boule- ;
yard around the lake. This strip is to be
givt n free. , . .. .
Should a park lie purchased in that
hborhood there would be sufficient'
travel to warrant continuing the Fourth
avenue railroad. The syndicate is pre- '
i to leave the tracks down, unless,
:.e of its officers stated, "some
cranks" order them to take them up and
tally abandon their franchise.
HONOBED IK.ISH HEROES.
St. Mary's College Athletic Associa
tion Gave a Creditable
Entertainment.
OAKLAND, March 21.â The students o
St. Mary's College gave a literary am
- musical entertainment last evening in th<
assembly hall of the college, under th(
auspices of the College Athletic Associa
tion. The stage was beautifully decor
ated'with* the green and gold of Ire
land wreathed in graceful folds with the
stars and stripes. The numbers were
well rendered and the students demon
strated that they were truly in accord
with the spirit of 1795, the mention ol
which always evoked the most generous
applause.
The exercises were opened by Thomas
i 1. Donovan, president of the day, whe
flielivered a very interesting address. Th.
oration of Leo F. Tormey was a mas
terly effort and he was frequently in
terrupted by the applause of his fellow
students. He spoke at length on th(
glories and hardships of the Irish peo
ple, and concluded by saying: "The
is not far distant when haughty Albion
crushed by the weight of guilt, shall
crumble to her ruin. Another Fontenoy
more terrible than its predecessor shall
drive away forever the last redcoat from
Irish soil, while the glorious harp and
shamrock, glowing with thrice its for
mer luster, will wave again in College
Green, upheld by a true and generous
people. Then will the principles of the
heroes of '98 be promulgated and Em
met's name will be written on monumen
tal stone."
E. T. Mallon was the poet of the day
and his poem was replete with beautiful
sentiments concerning St. Patrick and the
iand be converted to the faith. The mu
sical portion of the programme was under
the direction of Professor Schorct, and
was well rendered. .
The officers of the St. Mary's College
Athletic Association, under whose aus
pices the entertainment was given, are:

Alameda County Folks Finding Out
How Much Taxes Women
Pay
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, March 21.
The Political Equality League of Ala
' meda County is much gratified at me
manner in which suffragists have re
; sponded to the appeal for help lor the
I States that are to pass upon t.*e suffrage
question in the near future.
President JVirs. Lloyd Baldwin has re
, eently had an opportunity of canvassing
the sentiment, of the suffragists of me
i county, and she has found a very gradual
! growtli in its favor. The formal appeal
sent out by her for funds about a month
ago has resulted in quite a sum being
, collected to aid the National Suffragist
ation in its work. For over a year
there has been a division of opinion
among the ladies of the cause 01 tfle
failure to carry Alameda County in ISIHS.
A few weeks ago one of the ladies, Mrs.
S. C. Borland, made a statement that the
Eastern suffragists killed the movement
In this county by dictating to instead of
collaborating with the workers in this
county. The prophecy was made ihat on
this account the appeal to helo the Na
tionals would not be very productive.
President Baldwin, when asked as to
the reception of her circular letter, said
she was surprised at the response, "it
is a I Â«i M" mistaKe," she said "to presume
that Alameda County is not doing her
share of propaganda work or that the
movement is going t<> pieces here. A few
of our workers have a mistaken idea, of
the value of the help that we received
from the Eastern ladies. They gave us
the full benefit of their experience, and
we could not have done so well as we did
without it. Our cause in Alameda and
San Francisco counties was lost through
the united efforts of the saloon men and
wealthy brewers. We are going right
ahead on our usual lines, and although
we cannot get this question before this
State this election, we shall be heard
from in Sacramento next January."
The suffragists have been much elated
lately by the discovery that half of
Broadway in this city is owned by ladies.
It is probable that the whole assessment
roll will be gone over before tne next
campaign, so that the ladies may- know
exactly what taxes they pay "without
representation."
SCHOOL DISTRICT FIGHT.
Elmhurst Would Enlarge at the Ex
pense of Lockwood, but Is
Opposed.
OAKLAND, March 21.â The Board of
Supervisors were presented with a pe
tition this morning', asking that a por
tion of the Lockwood school district be
set off and annexed to the Elmhurst.
Among the names of the petitioners were
those of W. J. Keating, J. Hitchcock, W.
H. Roth, W. G. Williamson, K. M. Smith.
Alexander Goess, Edward Pelletier, A. C.
Christiansen, L. T. Higgins, Jose A. C.
de Forte of Lockwood district; and Ed
Horest, J. L. Lills, Newton Gray, A,
Meyer, M. S. Shaw and W. Lyon of Elm
hurst.
The reasons given for this request,
which is indorsed by County Superintend
ent J. P. Gariick, are given as "the chil-
Uving in that section which it is
proposed to change have to pass two or
more very Questionable wayside resorts
going to and coming from the Lockwood
district; the territory proposed to '>Â»Â»
annexed is nearer Elmhurst than the
Lockwood school, and the Lockwood dis
trict is taxed to its utmost limit now."
The petition is opposed by J. Tyrrcl, C.
A. Silva and G. W. Hacelton, trustees of
the Lockwood district. They claim that
they have just pupils enough for their
four rooms and teachers and that by
taking away from them they would no*t
have enough for four and too many for
three teachers. The matter will betaken
up next Monday morning at 11 o'clock,
when both sides will be given a hear-

AS DANGEROUS
AS KISSING
The Health Officer Is
After Microbes in
Telephones.
Analysis Being Made of the
Secretions in Mouth
pieces.
Dr. Dunn Believes There Is Need
of a Uniform System of
Cleansing.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
DOS Broadway, March 21.
If it bo practicable, and can be done
legally, an ordinance will soon be enact
ed that will protect the users of tele
phones from probable contraction of dis
ease. Â»
Some very interesting experiments are
about to be made by the Health Depart
ment that will determine how much dan
ger lurks in the little black mouthpiece
of the talking boxes. The matter has
been brought up before the Boards of
Health of many cities, but no definite ac
tion has yet been taken, so far as can be
learned.
Health Officer Dunn has now taken up
this matter in earnest, and has already
been surprised at the result. Although
not prepared to say much about the dan
ger, Dr. Dunn has seen enough to con
vince him that much filth lodges in the
mouthpieces, and that there should be
some system of keeping them clean.
"Some of the secretions 1 have collect
ed." said Dr. Dunn, "have surprised me,
and I wonder that the subject has not
been officially treated before this. 1 have
Been congealed breath actually dripping
from the mouthpieces. No one knows
what consumptive persons may have
sprayed microbes into it, and should it
be used in the dark, as telephones often
are, the experience is repulsive.
"The habit of indiscriminate kissing is
not, in my opinion, any more dangerous
than the common use of telephones. 1
have already some specimens of the de
posits and they are vile. There are tracts
of tobacco juice, whisky, and Other stale
things, but we have not yet learned
whether deadly bacilli lodge thereâ but
presumably they do. It is not an easy
matter to prescribe a remedy, but it is
certainly as important as many other
hygienic measures that the public is now
very particular about. When ready I
shall turn some of the specimens
taken from the phones over to Dr. H. A.
Ryfkogel, who will make a thorough
chemical analysis. I have learned that
there are certain devices that claim to
be automatically disinfectant, but it is
incumbent on us to go about the matter
very thoroughly and discover, if possi
ble, a remedy. If the danger is as great
as is anticipated, we cannot take stock
in the casual use of toys, but must adopt
some uniform system. The. rapid in
crease in the use of telephones makes an
investigation imperative."
Before the Council.
OAKLAND, March 21.â The Henneber
ry resolution to ignore the veto of Mayor
Thomas was passed to-night by a vote
of 6 to 4. Councilman Girard being ab
sent. Couneilmen Rowe and I'pton de
clared such an action worthless and a
waste of time, but no response was made
to their remarks. The veto was presented
and President Pringle asked "Shall tho
veto be sustained?' Hermeherry stepped
forward and presented a copy of his reso
lution that had been before the commit
tee and after it was read moved its adop
tion. The request of the Hoard of Edu
cation for permission to exchange prop
erty on Fifth street, between Linden and
Chestnut streets, f. >r a lot liOo by 160 on
Castro street, between Eighth and Ninth,
with a c;ish bonus of $15,000, and permis
sion to remove the Tompkina school
building to the new lot, was passed to
print. The resolution granting the South
Pacific Coast Railway a franchise
over the curve from Webster to Harrison
street, south of Second street, was also
passed to print. It included a section
providing that the company should keep
the block in which the curve occurred
clear of all obstructions to sight. OthiT
m< asures passed to print were one to
protect employes and patrons of street
railway companies by compelling them to
construct glass fronts on both < -nds of all
cars, and establishing "General specifi
cations for improving and paving main
thoroughfares, business and residence
streets."
Three Inquests.
OAKLAND, March 21.â Coroner Bald
win held three Inquests to-night with one
jury. Testimony for all three was taken
and the deliberations of the jury w. â !â¢â¢â¢
taken afterward. The first case was that
of Alvin Norlan of Golden Gate, in which
some ono accused Dr. A. H. Pratt or a
drug clerk of giving a child the wrong
medicine. The jury found that death re
sulted from pneumonia, as certified by
Dr. Pratt, and that the medicine was ail
right.
In the cisf of Thomas Moore, a colored
man of West Oakland, it was determined
that death was the result of consump
tion, and nothing was discovered that
was irregular.
The: greatest interest was manifested
in the case of Gee Lee, whose death fol
lowed a fracture of the right leg near
the thigh. Dr. R. S. Btrattr i reduced
the fracture and placed the 1< .n splints.
Lee was then removed to tho laundry
and Dr. Hai Lo Tai of San Francisco
.summoned. On his arrival ho removed
the dressings, twisted the leg, and aft. r
putting on some ointment bound it up
with rngs and bark. These were placed
fully six inches below the fracture. It
was expected that the jury would find
the Oriental physician responsible for
Lee's death, but they attributed it to the
shock occasioned by tbe fracture.

RECRUITS FOR
THE ARTILLERY
Changes in the Territo
rial Limits of Military
Departments.
Colonel James M. Moore, Chief
Quartermaster, Leaves To-
Day for San Diego.
Lieutenant Charles T. Menoher Or
dered Eastâ He Will Probably Be
Adjutant of the Sixth Artillery.
The following orders were issued from
military headquarters in this city yester
day:
Pursuant to authority from the War
Department, Colonel James M. Moore,
assistant quartermaster-general. United
States army, ami chief quartermaster
Department of California, will proceed
to San Diego and Ballast Point. Cal., on
public business pertaining to water trans
portation required in connection with the
mounting of guns at Ballast Point.

from the major-general commanding the
army, First Lieutenant Charles T. Meno
her, Third Artillery (Presidio), is relieved
from duty in this department and will
proceed without delay to Fort Mcllenry,
Hi, reporting upon his arrival to the
colonel of the Sixth Artillery for duty.
It is generally believed that Lieutenant
Menoher will he appointed adjutant of
the regiment, and that his transfer was
made by the adjutant-general of the
army on the request of Colonel Williston
of the Sixth.
It is probable that Colonel Williston
made his selection of a regimental adju
tant before he left California to take com
mand of the newly created Sixth Regi
ment of artillery. Other transfers are
likely to be announced before long.
A recent circular issued by the War De
partment says that until further orders

be disposed of in accordance with the
special instructions given the recruiting
olficers.
Recruits for the artillery should be
young:, active men of a good degree of
intelligence, and a considerable proportion
of those enlisted for the heavy artillery
should, in addition, possess a fair knowl
edge of arithmetic.
Commanding officers of posts who re
ceive no special instructions in the mat
ter will telegraph to the adjutant-gen
eral of the army whenever tHere are two
or more artillery recruits at a post avail
able for assignment, designating the num
ber for heavy artillery and light artillery
separately.
Recruiting for other arms at all stations
will be limited to the enlistment or re
enlistment of exceptionally desirable men
who fulfill all requirements, whether re
cruits or former soldiers.

HACKMAN IN TROUBLE.
John O'Brien Booked on Two Charges
of Grand Larceny.
John O'Brien, a hackman, was booked
at the City Prison yesterday afternoon
by Detective Silvey and Corporal Gei
mann on two charges of grand larceny.
Sunday afternoon Albert P. Burkhardt,
743 Mission street, engaged O'Brien to
drive him and Mrs. Mary McMahon and
a lady friend of Mrs. McMahon to the
roadhouse of Mrs. McMahon's husband
at Twenty-second and Point Lobos ave
nues.
Borkhardt was under the influence of
liquor, and when they got to the road
house O'Brien put him in bed and took
his shoes off. The ladies did not like
O'Brien's interference and insisted upon
him going away. After O'Brien left
Burkhardt claimed that his diamond pin,
valued at $125, had been stolen from him
and Mrs. McMahon discovered that her
gold watch, valued at $75. which she had
placed under the mattress in the bed, had
also been stolen. The police were noti
fied and early yesterday morning the two
officers arrested O'Brien. Yesterday af
ternoon Burkhardt and Mrs. McMahon
swore to complaints in Judge Conlan's
court, charging O'Brien with grand lar
ceny, and he was booked on the charges.
INDIRECT BOUNTIES.
Underhanded Competition of French
Sugar Manufacturers Will Be
Reduced.
Collector Jackson received yesterday the
following circular from Secretary of the
Treasury Gage relative to the duty on
French sugars:
It appears that under the operation of
the law of France now in force, sugars
produced in and exported from that coun
try, receive, in addition to the export
bounties specified in Department Circular
No. 153 of September 22, 1597, indirect
bounties in the following amounts:
Sugars receiving direct export bounties
of 3.50 francs, 4.00 francs and' 4.50 francs
per 100 kilograms receive indirect boun
ties of 5.67 francs, 6.4S francs and 7.29
francs per 10*) kilograms, respectively.
The countervailing duties to be as
sessed on such sugars under the provis
ions of section 5 of the act of July 24,
1897, must therefore be equal to 9.17 francs.
10.48 francs and 11.79 francs per 100 kilo
grams, respectively.
This decision of the Treasury Depart
ment is fraught with the greatest im
portance, not only to the American man
ufacturers of sugar, but to the farmers
of California now engaged and about to
be engaged in the cultivation of the sugar
beet.
Admitted to Citizenship.
Martin Johnson, a native of Norway,

CRITICIZED
THE CRITICS
Dr. Curry Scores Those
Who Find Fault With
the Bible.
Ministers Who Do This, He
Says, Make Themselves
Ridiculous.
Rev. A. O. Stevens Reads a Paper on
Poetryâ The Doings of the
Ministers.
The papers read before the ministers'
clubs yesterday morning were of more
than usual interest. Dr. Curry ad
dressed the Presbyterian ministers and
spoke eloquently and long." During his
remarks ho made the following asser
tions: "This is an age of critics, and
they have let themselves loose on the
Bible. I believe in scholarship and In a
thorough knowledge and careful study
of God's word and investigation of its
claims. But I do not believe there is jus
tice in any call for the destructive criti
cism that many who claim to be schol
ars of the ago are making upon God's
word. Many who are in the pulpits are
aping scholarship and so making them
selves ridiculous, leading many into
doubt and down to eternal mire."
The gentleman went on to tell of the
effect that the gospei would have on the
capital and labor question, and declared
that the Bible would be the great medi
ator.
The Congregationalists heard a very
entertaining paper composed by Rev. A.
O. Stevens of Oakland, entitled. "The
Value to the Preachers of Studies in
Poetry." He paid in part:
"We may doubtless assume that by
most of us the childish notion that
poetry is a form of literature designed to
please the ear, serving principally as a
means of recreation, has been outgrown.
"Good poetry will usually please the
ear; and poetry is often a means of re
creation, and as such is valuable to the
preacher. But I have in mind a more
serious purpose which poetry subserves,
and am very firmly convinced that the
great use of poetry is something other
than pleasure or recreation. For the
preacher poetry seems to me to possess a
peculiar value in helping him to appre
hend religious truth, and giving him fa
cility in its apt expression."
"What books ministers ought to have"
was the subject that Rev. J. Stephens
enlightened his brethren of the Method
ist church on at their meeting yesterday
morning. A great deal of discussion
arose over his paper and one minister
made the remark that he preferred the
"Arabian Nights" and "Robinson Cru
soe" to some of the English novels.
A paper causing a number of com
ments was also read before the Christian
ministers by Rev. W. A. Gardner on
"How-to got the greatest good from the
Lord's Supper at public worship." Near
ly everybody had views on this subject
Ihe greatest point discussed was wheth
er the communion should be given before
or after the sermon.
The Baptist ministers held an extreme
ly long session yesterday. The paper
read was on Calvinism, and was read by
Rev. J. Downie.

WIND BLEW
SLOAN`S WAY
The Lilliputian Horseman
Was First on Five
Mounts.
Ed Corrigan Felt Aggrieved
at Pulling Down Only
Three Purses.
One of These Was the Occidental
Stake, Taken by Frank.
Ireland.
James Tod Sloan, formerly of America,
but later of England, gave a riding re
cital at Ingleside track yesterday, and
with one accord it was pronounced an un
qualified success. Sloan in his efforts
in the saddle was supported by a corp
of cheaper jockeys of more or less note.
Charley Thorpe, the Emeryville meteor,
was an absentee. Tod declined to mount
jn the opening event, but after that nis
number was more prominent than a po
liceman's star at a tough picnic. The di
minutive rider and Ed Corrigan, the mas
sive master of Hawthorne, held a jolli
fication at the conclusion of the sport, for
Corrigan won three of the events de
cided, including the Occidental stake, and !
Tod scored on five successive occasions.
It was reopening day at the local track
and there whs a fair gathering of the tal- j
ent present. The members of the ring '
feel sore: when it was all over, as every
favorite came tumbling in first heavily
backed, with the exception of Masoero.
The track was in excellent condition, but
the strong wind prevailing hindered the \
horses from making many inroads on the j
track records, though Briar Sweet did
break the rule by shattering the live-fur
long mark.
Sloan began his all-conquering career
astride the- latter filly, followed by
landing the $10w Occidental stake at four
and a half furlongs with Frank J^eland.
It was a selling affair, and the Corrigan
entry, entered to In- sold for $500, car
ried 98 pounds. The youngster was a
6 to 5 favorite in the betting, and catch- i
ing LJuviia Ventura, a 40 to 1 chance, after !
crossing the bar, won easily in 5534. The !
outsider took the place, driving from To-
Briar Sweet, the fast daughter of Sir
Modred, was banded about as the warm
one in the five-furlong .sprint, and she
more than fulfilled expectations. Backed
down from >â  to ii to <i to 5, she led her
company from the start, winning in romp
ing fashion from Bellieoso in 1:00%, set
ting a new track record. O'Connell was
a. close third.
Fur the iir^t event decided the erratic
performer, Masoero. was sent to the post
favorite, but Stevens managed to Â£et him
mixed up at the start, and though show-.
Ing speed was unplaced at th<_- end. Old
Tim Murphy, a :>A> to 1 chance, surprised the
crowd by leading th<- Held to the stretch,
where Gray on Mamie G. the second
choice, got through next the rail, win
ning by a scant half length. William
U'lS came fast, securing the show.
The mile event, in which Paul Gripps
and Buckwa looked the contenders, was
declared off. and a cheap Blx-furlong
filing run substituted. Corrigan's Queen
Nubia was backed down to even money
favoritism, and never left the result in
doubt. Sloan taking her out in front and
winning all the way. Stentor. cleverly
piloted by Johnny Woods, downed the ex
tensively played Break O'Day for the
place.
Corrigan's gelding Joe T'llman went to
the post at odds of 3 to 5 for the mile and
a furlong selling run, and the result
shewed the price to have been a most lib
eral one. lit galloped in front all the
way, winning in a jaunt by four lengths
in 1:55%. Fashion Plate managed to take
place honors from Rey del Tierra.
Tod Sloan scored his fifth win of thfi
day on the back of Dr. Marks in the final
mile selling run. The doctor issued from
the paddock a C to 3 favorite, and head-
Ing Ban Venado in the stretch, won clev
erly by a neck in l:4i >;; 4 . Don Luis was a
poor third.
TRACK NOTES.
Carrie Lyle, the full sister to Libertine,
owned and raced by Starter "Curly"
Brown, recently won a mile race at New
Orleans, backed down to 6 to 5 favor
itism.
The stable folks thought well of Rubi
con, emptying quite a package of coin into !
the ring on the chestnut horse to show.
He was slow to get in motion which mit
igated against his chances.
Phil Casey and ex-Alderman Dunne, the
renowned exponents of handball, visited
the track yesterday as guests of Ed Cor
riÂ«?an.

races in which Veragua is a starter are
run of late, he manages to keep outside
of the money, after receding in the bet
ting.
Dick Clawson on Tim Murphy threw
the race away. Had he hugged the rail
instead of allowing Gray on Mamie G
to get through, the old roam sprinter
would have had his number hoisted on
top.
Joe Ullman was backed, off the boards
on the strength of a very fast workoui.
which was said to have ovsrshadowe-i a
trial made by Geyser.
The new rule at Ingleside of compel
ling the horses to line up against the bar
rier was put into effect yesterday. liar-
Ting one or two instances good starts
were accomplished with very slight de
lays.
Briar Sweet, the fast sister to Dr. Has
brouck, reduced the Ingleside record for
live furlongs from 1:01 to l:<X>V->, and she
could have done better. Unless the chest
nut lilly goes amiss there is trouble brew
injr for some of the Eastern division.
Jim Neil says he has done with the
horses for good. He will try the lighters
again. Jim is now manager for Hugh
Dougherty and is willing to match him
against any lliG-pounder on the coast for
a substantial side bet. Dougherty won
the championship of the Middle West in
the feather-weight class at Chicago dur
ing the World's Fair, and if no otner op
ponent shows up, he is willing to take
J_>al Hawkins on at 12S pounds.
Lavator by Salvator-Hot Spring, a
half-brother to Geyser, was well backed
to capture the two-year-old stake. After
opening up equal choice in the betting
with Frank Ireland, he receded to threes,
when a stiff play forced his odds down
to 11 to 5. He appeared to be green at
the starting gate and was virtually left
at the post.
Twenty bookmakers chalked up odds in
the betting ring and nearly every one of
them quit a heavy loser on the day.
Key del Tierra was heavily played for
the show and Fashion Plate for the
place. It was a rare sample of goud
"doping" on somebody's part.
The gossips are now trying to connect
another well-known light-weight riders
name with that of a certain heavy bet
tor, who sprang up meteor-like the last
three months. If it keeps on what a
good time there will be at the investi
gation to-morrow evening. If every book
maker is ruled off whose name is men
tioned in connection with the frauds sun
posed to have been existing, the betting
ring at Ingleside will probably be trans
tormed into a shooting gallery" next week

The Children of Otis J. Preston Are
Fighting Over His Estate.
Before the estate of the late Otis J.
Preston, vice-president of the firm of
Preston & McKinnon and of the Shoal
water Bay Mill Company, is settled, a
large slice of it will be in the hands of
attorneys. Preston died on the 2d ult.,
leaving a valuable estate to be distrib

ago Preston gave deeds to several valu
able pieces of property to his children
Evelyn E., Celestine R., William P.,
Otis J. Preston Jr., and Mrs. Florence
Marshutz. The other children. Ernest J.,
Denzil C. Preston and Mrs. Geraldine M.
Chamberlain, did not know of the trans
fer until after their father's death. Be
lieving that their father had been unduly
influenced by their brothers and sisters,
the three last named children of the de
ceased commenced suit yesterday to have
the gift deeds set aside. They charge that

their father was, by deceitful process, in
duced to deed away the property, and
they now seek to have the transfer set
aside. It is not improbable that a con- |

ton will be commenced within the next

WAS SHE
LURED TO
THE SOUTH?
Irene Lynch, the Miss
ing Girl, May Yet
Be Located.
Said to Have Left on a
Visit to "Lucky" Bald
win's Ranch.
Her Distracted Father Anxious
to Meet the Wealthy
Horseman.
MET AT THE RACETRACK.
Police Expected to Find thÂ« Girl
Last Night, but Were Dis
appointed.
According to the police Irene Lynch,
the fourteen-year-old daughter of
Daniel Lynch, living at 524 Geary
street, was not abducted as was
claimed by her parents, but is enjoying
life at Santa Anita Ranch, in Los An
geles. The girl is said to be a friend of
E. J. Baldwin, otherwise known as
â¢Lucky" Baldwin, and it is claimed she
frequently met him at the Ingleside
race track.
On the morning of March 9 Irene,
who is said to be very pretty, left her
home, after promising to return in a
short time. She failed to appear, and
since then her whereabouts has been
wrapped in the deepest mystery. Her
parents, fearing that something had
happened to her, at once communicated
with the police, with the result that
Detective Anthony was instructed to
find the missing girl. After a thorough
investigation he became convinced that
Irene was stopping at Baldwin's ranch
in Los Angeles, but fearing bloodshed
he refrained from notifying her par
ents.
Somebody informed the father of the
girl that she was en route to Victoria,
accompanied by a male acquaintance.
Lynch, who was determined to save
his daughter from the disgrace which
she had brought upon herself, took the
first train to Seattle, after telegraph
ing to the authorities at Victoria to
hold her. After he had arrived at the
latter place he found that Irene was
not aboard the boat on which he
thought she had taken passage, and
he immediately returned to this city.
Last night he and Detective Anthony
went to Oakland expecting to meet
Baldwin, who had telegraphed he
would arrive by the Los Angeles ex
press. Both Anthony and Lynch had
reeei% - od reports to the effect that
Baldwin and Miss Lynch would arrive
in this city last evening. As the train
pulled in the depot Anthony made a
thorough search of the cars but failed
to find either of the missing ones. Con
vinced that she was not on the train
the detective, accompanied by the anx
ious par* nt, returned to this city. After
reaching here Anthony informed Chief
of his failure to locate the girl,
and acting on hiri suggestion a dispatch
was sent to the police of Los Angeles
asking them to make a thorough inves
tigation.
Anthony, while refusing to admit
that Baldwin took the girl to his ranch,
says that it is not unlikely he will be
able to show in a short time that she
wa< with him a short time before her
disappearance.
Several days aft^r hor disappearance
Baldwin left this city to visit his ranch
in the southern part of the State. The
missing girl suddenly disappeared on
the preceding Wednesday and accord
ing to the police she bought a ticket
for I^os Angeles. This fact was not
discovered until her father had gone
to Seattle expecting to find his erring
daughter en route to the Klondike.
-Mis. Lynch, the mother of the miss
ing girl, refuses to believe that her
daughter was abducted by the aged
millionaire, but says that if she has
been enticed away and betrayed she
will leave no stone unturned and at the
first opportunity will kill the guilty
one.
"My Irene was always a good girl,
and I don't think that she would volun
tarily leave home to accompany any
man. She had but few male ac
quaintances, and the few young men
that shr- did know always came to the
house when they wanted to see her.
Her whole time was occupied with her
musical studies, and even if she had a
roving disposition and a desire to run
away from home she showed no evi
dences of it at home, because she
seemed to love home in preference to
the pageantry of the world.
"That Irene was in the habit of mak
ing visits to Baldwin's home and was
seen several times returning from his
mansion on California street as late as
10 o'clock in the evening is an untruth,
as she was never out at such a late
hour unless she was accompanied either
by me or her brother. She could not
possibly have made these visits without
my knowledge, as I always waited up
until long after she and her sister had
retired, which was usually at 9 o'clock,
and there was no possible way for her
leaving the house secretly after I had
retired, as the two girls slept together
in the same room.

WHERE THE
SOLICITOR
COMES IN
Methods Employed to
Work the Private
Contract Dodge.
A Good Friend in the
Board of Supervisors
Always Needed.
Property Owners of Big In
fluence Often Obtain
a Rebate.
BIDS NEVER OPENED.
Record of a Private Contract Obtained
by the Firm of Flinn
& Treacy.
The elections which take place in San
Francisco once in every two years or
once in every four years, as the Su
preme Court in its wisdom may de
cree, occasionally bring a change in
the personnel of the Street Department,
but seldom bring a change in the
methods pursued by the department to
make the property owner stand all that
the land will bear for improvement.
The present Superintendent of Streets,
Mr. Ambrose, inherited a few of the
men and many of the practices of his
predecessor in office, Mr. Ashworth. All
the tricks of the old Board of Super
visors are known to the new and some
modern features have been introduced
to catch the unwary owner of urban
real estate.
The contractors who live and thrive
on the profits of street work have got
the business down to a fine point, and
with the addition of a few kinks sup
plied by the solicitors can pave the way
to the poorhouse for any one who owns
real property.
The solicitor is a new element in the
business, but promises to be a perma
nent one. The chief function of the so
liciting genius is to persuade property
owners that it is cheaper to have work
done by private contract than to have
the street "Vroomanized' by direction
of the Board of Supervisors.
At the outset each of the big con
tracting firms had a solicitor and fre
quently several of the soliciting agents
found themselves in active competition
for the same piece of work. As a result
prices tumbled, and contractors saw
that the competition w-ould be ruinous
if pursued. Simultaneously the solicit
ors saw that there was nothing in it for
themselves if prices were cut down,
and so they formed a union. The union
developed more strength than they at
first fancied. In a short time the solic
itors found themselves strong enough
to do a little business on their own ac
! count with the Board of Supervisors,
and so adjust affairs that the contrac
tor would have to see the solicitor be
fore any work could be done.
The first move of the solicitor is to
have a friend in the Board of Supervi
! sors introduce a resolution of intention
ito pave a certain block. If the proper
ty owners do not wish to be burdened
at that time with the cost of paving,
they must get a majority protest
against the proposed work. If they
succeed in getting the protest the work
is delayed six months. If they fail bids
may be invited by advertisement. Con
tractors outside of the ring, who have
no affiliation with the solicitor, may
presume to bid for the work, but some
! thing is likely to happen which will
prevent the bids from being opened.
It often happens that some member of
j the board moves to reject all the bids.
This motion prevails, but the solicitor
\is not disheartened. The property
j owner having exhausted his right of
1 protest, the solicitor comes on the scene
j and presents a private contract with
| the explanation that the cost of adver
; tising and other expenses may be saved
by the private deal. Rebates are of
fered to get backward individuals to
come forward and ultimately a private
contract is obtained by which property
owners on an average through the
block pay three or four cents more a
square foot for paving than they would
be compelled to pay in apen and fair
competition in the Board of Supervi
sors.
At the appointed time a smooth fel
low appears on the scene as the repre
sentative of a reliable and worthy firm
of contractors. He describes the con
fiscating features of the Vroc-rnan act
and convinces owners of real estate
that their only salvation is in a private
contract. He has his contracts in
blank for 22 or 23 cents a foot. He
offers a rebate to the property owner
of big influence. When three-fourths of
the frontage has been secured the soli
citor takes his time. The owners of
the remaining fourth are in his grasp
On May 17, lsa,, the Street Superin
tendent recommended that Twenty
third street, from Harrison street to
Potrero avenue, be paved with bitumi
nous rock. On May 24 the Board of
Supervisors passed a resolution to per
form the work. On June 16 the proper
ty owners filed a protest and work was
stopped for six months. On December
16, 1897, another protest was filed. On
January 10, 1898, the board decided
against the protest of December 16. On
January 31 bids were received and laid
over one week, on motion of Supervisor
Devany. On February 3 the bids were
laid over for four weeks. On March 3
they were laid over for one week. The
bids were not opened, hence no one in
the Board of Supervisors was supposed
to know officially what figures were
contained in the sealed envelopes. It
does not appear that anybody wanted
to know, because the board on March
10 reported in favor of giving Flinn &
Treacy a private contract. The figure
on the private contract is 21 cents a
square foot for bituminous rock pave
ment and 80 cents a front foot for gran
ite curbs.
The original bidders before the Board
of Supervisors for the work were the
City Street Improvement Company, Pa
cific Paving Company, Flinn & Treacy,
C. B. Williams, J. J. Dowling and John
R. Morton.
The Call understands that the ruling
price for work of this character ranges
from 15% cents to 18% cents per square
foot. It would be interesting at this
time to know if some of the unopened
bids did not contain figures less than 21
cents a square foot. Information from
contractors on this point would be ac
ceptable at The Call office.
The Grand Jury might ascertain, to
gratify public curiosity, just what
figures were given by the contractors
who offered in public competition to
perform the work. The Supervisors of
course could not know, as the bids were
never opened, but it did take the board
a remarkably long time to decide
whether to open the bids or send them
back to the bidders unopened.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 22, 1898.
ROBERT EMMET DOYLE.
Funeral of th>e Late Assistant Postmaster of
San F r ancisco.
There was laid at rest last Saturday in Calvary Cemetery, alongside of
his brother-in-law, the late ex-United States Senator Eugene Casserly. the re
mains of a man with a national tnstory. This was Robert E. Doyle, Deputy
Postmaster of this city under the late Frank McCoppin. The death and burial
of Mr. Doyle were unannounced in the daily papers, yet his funeral was at
tended by a large cortege of prominent citizens.
Robert Emmet Doyle, modest in manner and unassuming for notoriety, had,
nevertheless, a history in the earlier period of the State. He was born in New
York in IS2S, and was educated in Georgetown College, District of Columbia,
from which he graduated in 1549, after which he started for California via the
isthmus, arriving in this city the same year, and, like the majority of early
arrivals, engaged in mining. In ls^l he returned to San Francisco and became
a journalist. From here he went to Central Ainericaand connected himself with
the Nicaragua Company, but left there and went to New York. He came back
again to this city in 1857, when he formed a partnership with James Birch and
operated the first stage line from San Antonio, Tex., to San Diego, a distance of
1400 miles.
In those days staging was beset with danger from the several bands of hos
tile Indians. Yet the contract was faithfully carrieu out by the stage company
on schedule time of twenty-eight days. In IS6I the service was shortened to
semi-weekly, at an expense to the Government of $300,inX> per annum.
The Civil ..ar broke up this contract, and Doyle and h.s partners saw their
entire stock seized and confiscated by the rebel leaders in Arizona, with no com
pensation from the Government from that clay to this. Having lost all he had,
he entered the service of the then "Wheat King." Isaac Friedlander, where he
remained until that monarch died. The next heard of Mr. Doyle was his ap
pointment as Deputy Postmaster of San Francisco under Frank McCoppin,
which posuion he held until death removed the head o t.iat department, when
he was appointed Postmaster pro tern., pending the filling of the vacancy by
President McKinley.
ATTEMPTED
TO SELL A
COLD BRICK
Attorney Haymond
Confesses to an Il
legal Act.
Hoffs Statement Peddled
at His Partner's In
stigation.
The Whole Matter Laid Bare
Before Judge Cook and Dis
barment May Follow.
TWO LAWYERS TO SUFFER
Attorneys Wonder at WhÂ«t Is to
Come and Co-conspirators May
Vet Disagree.
Attorney Edgar Haymond of Hoff
confession fame is not missing as re
ported, and from his recent actions a
rumor has been circulated that he has
been approached and hypnotized by a
loose confession editor. The rumor
seems to have a rather solid founda
tion from the fact that on Sunday
evening he visited the home of Judge
Carroll Cook and in mild manner and
with a written document to back ur> his
assertions, stated that he had been im
plicated in the desire to get $2000 for a
written document purporting to be a
cold blooded statement and acknowledg
ment of the murder of Mrs. Clute. That
was not all, however, that rather jarred
on the system of the unsuspecting
Judge, as the guilty party seemed
desirous of throwing the blame on his
partner, Mclntosh, and from informa
tion given by Judge Cook, Haymond
was penitent and stated that he had
carried out the plan to get the desired
amount through the pleadings of his
co-conspirator, and was anxious that
the papers should be presented to the
Bar Association for the purpose of hav
ing disbarment proceedings instituted.
When the Hoff case was resumed in
Judge Cook's court yesterday morning
the air seemed to be full of mystery,
and when the noon recess had been
taken and the' jury excused the sus-
pense was over, as the Judge stated
that Attorney Haymond had visited
! him last evening and told of his con
nection with the Hoff confession case.
Attorneys throughout the hall had
heard of the interesting proceedings,
and in consequence the court room was
soon crowded by attentive listeners to
hear the words of the Judge.
Judge Cook stated that on Sunday
evening Attorney Haymond had placed
| a written document in his hands which
had implicated him in the Hoff matter
and that according to the wishes c-f the
attorney the papers had been placed in
the hands of the Bar Association, and
that .within a few days proceedings
would be taken for the disbarment of
the self-anus, o ;.nd his partner in the
legal profession.
Judge Cook further remarked that
Attorney Raymond had included in his
written document that his partner had
approached him with the purpose in
view of. having him do the necessary
work in obtaining the desired $2000, and
that in compliance with that request
had acted to the best of his ability.
The < ommunications received by the
Judge are now in the hands of respon
sible parties connected with the Bar
Association, but it is not at all likely
that anything will be done in connec
tion with the matter until the trial of
Hoff has been finished, as it is tho-ught
the case may affect the interests of the
man now on trial for his life.
After developments may prove rather
interesting to many members of the
profession, and without doubt there
will be a split up in the firm of Hay
mond & Mclntosh.

KELSO TO BE
HAULED INTO
THE COURTS
A Rich Contractor
in the Toils of
the Law.
Sued for Divorce and Ar
rested for Striking an
Officer.
An Aged Husband Becomes
Belligerent and Insanely
Jealous.
A YOUNG WIFE'S GRIEF.
After Years of Suffering She Appeals
to the Courts for Jus
tice.
John Kelso, the well-known contractor
and president of the John Kelso Com
pany, has more trouble on his hands
than he ever dreamed would befall him
in old age.
The wealthy contractor will be in
Judge Low's court to-day for throwing
a process server downstairs and fractur
ing one of his ribs. As soon as he pays
his fine for this offense he will be called
before Judge Seawell for contempt of
court in the same matter, as Alexander
Moreno, who was serving the process of
Judge Seawell's court, represented the
power and dignity of the State, at the
same time that he was seeking to for
ward the interests of Mrs. Eleanor Kelso,
who is trying to free herself from the mat
rimonial bonds that tie her to the aged
and irascible John.
The troubles of the Kelso family be
gan many years ago, though the wife
has for ten years refused to sue for di
vorce on account of three young children.
A few weeks ago, however, she filed a
divorce suit on the ground of extreme
cruelty. Her attorney is L. B. Phillips,
whose processes were being served when
the defendant made a vicious assault
upon Moreno, who was carrying out the
legal steps of the domestic batile. The
paper which he was serving notified the
delendant that he must not transfer any
of his property pending the litigation.
The divorce suit itself is quite rich in
its charges. According to Mrs. Kelso's
statements her husband has been insane
ly jealous for many years, principally be
cause his wife is about 35 years of age
and handsome, while he verges close to
7U and has lost some of his early dim
ples.
The complaint gives the following suc
cinct account of the conduct which ren
dered it impossible for Mrs. Kelso to live
in peace with her husband:
"On the 20th of January at 2312 How
ard street defendant assaulted plaintiff
without excuse or provocation, and vio
lently and viciously struck her in the
face and knocked her down, cutting her
neck and injuring and bruising her head
and causing her great pain and suffer
ing."
It is alleged that on the same evening
defendant dragged his wife from a room
at the Donohoe building, where she was
taking music lessons, cursing her as h<Â»
forced her into the elevator and to his
buggy which was in front of the
Grand Central Market. The complaint
says that defendant forced his wife inttÂ»
the buggy, "using oaths and epithets in
the presence of strangers."
The complaint also says that the de
fendant is subject to violent and unreas
onable fits of jealousy, and that with
out any cause or provocation he exhibits
himself in the presence of his wife's
guests, "who are people of great refine
ment and gentility."
Mrs. Kelso and her children love lit
erature and music, according to the com
plaint, which seems to have made the
defendant very angry. It was when hia
wife was taking music lessons that Kelso
grew so violent in the Donohoe build-
ing.
There will be a big fight over the case
on account of the community property.
which is said to be worth $250,000. ThÂ»
wife has asked that defendant be re
strained from disposing of his property
and from interfering in any way wltn
the care and custody of his children.
They are now with their mother, who
seeks to retain them, alleging that she
is the more fit to have their care and
education. She asks for alimony to the
amount of $250 per month and for one
half of all the property, which consists
largely of houses, lands, mortgages and
bonds.
RARE OLD LACE.
Stuart, the Male Patti, Beceives It as
a Gift From Mrs. Diaz.
Stuart, the male Patti, who has long
been noted for his elegant wardrobe, has
just had an addition to it which would
make any lady in San Francisco envious.
The addition is a piece of costly hand
made lace presented to him by the wife
of President Diaz of The singer
w-as in Mexico several months ago with
the "1492" Company, and during his stay
was entertained to a great extent by the
Diaz family, and prior to his departure
from that city he was presented with
the lace, which was an heirloom in the
Diaz family. The lace Is a quarter of a
yard wide, and i.as a floral design. Stuart
was also made a member of the Order of
Maximilian, an honor conferred upon
very few, there being only 185 at present,
and the other members are of the highest
families in Mexico, many of them having
been nobles before the present form of
government was in order. The insignia
of the order is an enameled button of
blue, white and gold. The center part is
of white, and an inverted M in blue is in
the middle of the center. Around this are
bands of gold and bands of dark blue.
The back of the button is of gold. Stuart
is playing the part of Isabella in "1492,"
and some of his gownsâ many of which
he had made expressly for this cityâ are
"stunning."
Alaska Trade Convention.
It is expected that within the next few
days there will be a convention, com
posed of delegates of the Chamber of
Commerce, City Board of irade. Mer
chants' Association, Manufacturers' and
Producers' .-sssoeiation and the California
State Board of Trade, for the purpose of
determining upon ways and means of
carrying on the work laid out by the late
Alaska Trade Committee. During the
Mining Fair the latter body turned all of
its business and funds over to the State
Board of Trade, and the board wants the
help and support of vie other commercial
bodies in the work it has in hanu. The
board recently sent out invitations to the
organizations mentioned, asking them to
appoint a delegate to meet with their
committee and decide upon some definite
plan for advertising the advantages of
San Francisco as an outfitting nort for
Alaska. The Merchants' Association has
named H. H. Sherwood, the Manufactur

PLEA FOR A FREE PRESS
The ArchMshop Addresses the Catholic
Truth Society.
A meeting was held at Metropolitan Hall last night under the aU! *P lc
of the Catholic Truth Society, which was organized here several mon
ago by the Rev. P. C. Yorke. The society is based on the same plan as i c
Catholic Truth Society of England, having for its main object the flissem in -

members of the Catholic faith who are not as conversant as they snoum
with the history and teachings of their church. Notwithstanding the iaci
that the meeting was not widely advertised, Metropolitan Hall was _ co â¢~
fortably filled and it is expected that at the second meeting, to be hem
evening, those who do not get there early will be unable to find seats.
After an opening hymn the Rev. Archbishop P. W. Riordan deliverea
a short but spirited address. He said that it afforded him great pleasure
to know that during the few months of its existence in this city the Ca "J'
olic Truth Society had enrolled so many energetic workers in its ranks. Al
though the society is still young here," said ( he, "the officers and memDers
have already distributed over 90,000 pamphlets teaching the doctrines ana
tenets of the Catholic faith."
Archbishop Riordan then referred to the Sailors' Home, now under the
management of the Paulist fathers and said: "I trust the Home will grow
until every Catholic seaman who visits this poTt will receive and partake
of its benefactions. The Catholic Truth Society is now fully organized. Its
object is to spread Catholic doctrine among the people and refute the pre
vailing errors against the Catholic church. The United States is a reading
country. Every one is educated and every one reads. The people read
and are going to continue to read. I might say the press governs the
country. It molds and forms public opinion. I wouldn't be surprised it
the press forced us into war. It is doing the best it can that way. The
press is a powerful engine. For spreading ideas, it is the most powerful
engine in the world. For this reason the Catholic Truth Society has been
formed, to disseminate through the press the doctrines and history of the
Catholic church The press creates public opinion, and the only Scripture
some pepole read is the Sunday edition of their favorite daily Paper."
After outlining at considerable length the projects of the Catholic Truth
Society, the reverend speaker said that the majority of pupils when they
leave colleges or school have no formed opinion an any subject in the world.
"Their characters are built up in a great measure," said he, from what
they glean from books, magazines and the press. One vicious novel, one
impure or sophistical story, will undo the work of years of training and
teaching at school. Our great work will consist in taking the children when
they leave school and assist by means of our literature in building up their
intellectual and moral characters. Much has been said concerning the free
dom of the press. Perfect freedom is the guarantee of our success. If the
papers do tell lies once in a while, we can answer back. A free press is far
better than the despotism of Russia. All that the Catholic church asks is
fair play and an open field. The evils of a free press are not to be com
pared with those that grow under a suppressed press. We do not seek to
force religion on men. All that we ask and intend doing is to educate them
in the fundamental principles of the Catholic religion and the great part
the Catholic church has taken in the affairs of the world. We also intend
explaining our doctrines to those outside our fold. Man is a religious being.
The question of eternity is uppermost in his mind. He is not satisfied to
believe that he is only to live for a time and then die. He is always asking
something concerning the hereafter. The Catholic church is the largest
religious body in the world to-day, notwithstanding the trials and persecu
tions it has gone through. It stands to-day, triumphant and attracting the
attention of the world. There are thousands, aye, hundreds of thousands of
people who are looking for religious truth. We can reach them through
the medium of the press. As I have said before the press is a mighty en
gine. It has overturned more countries than armies have done. There is a
mass of prejudice in this community against the Catholic church. Through
the Catholic Truth Society and its pamphlets we will help them to find the
truth and a knowledge of the doctrines c-f the Catholic church."
Archbishop Riordan then closed his address with an eloquent tribute
to the memory of General Rosec-rans, who died recently at Los Angeles.
Father Yorke read the ninety-ninth psalm and at the conclusion the
large audience arose and sang "Loving Shepherd."
An interesting paper on "The Necessity of Catholic Reading" was next
read by John J. Barrett.
The Rev. Father Philip O'Ryan spoke at length of the good accomplish
ed by the Catholic church. "There is nothing more entrancing," said he.
"than the history of the Catholic church. Her influence on literature,
art, science and legislation has been the greatest the world has ever seen.
The Catholic church is not alone great in her history. Her dogmas and
her truths have satisfied all the seekers after truth." Father O'Ryan, in
conclusion, urged upon his hearers the necessity of Catholics reading up
the history of the Catholic church, so that if questioned upon any of her
dogmas they will be able to give intelligent and satisfactory answers.
"The Apostolic Spirit Among the Laity" was next discussed by the
Rev. Father Joseph Gleason. He said that the Catholic Truth Society was
organized to establish an apostolic spirit among the laity. He said that
it was the duty of the layman as well as the cleric to distribute the legacy
of the gospel to those who are not in the Catholic fold. He took the stand
that the Catholic conversant with the history of his church and the prin
ciples of his faith could bring many into the fold who never come within
the reach of the voice of the clergyman. >
The meeting concluded with an adress by James F. Smith. He said thlii
the apostolic spirit of the laity had been pretty dead for many years. He
added that the layman had left all the missionary work to the clergy. He
urged his hearers to become conversant with the principles of the tenets
of the Catholic faith, and by leading moral, upright lives set good examples
to all men.
