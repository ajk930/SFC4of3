WILLIAM A. CLARK
IS SLAIN BY HIS
BROTHER GEORGE
THE MODERN CAIN AND HIS VICTIM.
FT. HELENA, Cal., Jan. 20.â William
Anderson Clark, section boss of the
St. Helena division of the Southern Pa
cific Railroad, was assassinated a few
minutes after 5 o'clock this morning,
and there is little doubt that his brother
George was the murderer. It is known
that George Clark made several prev
ious attempts to kill his brother by ad
ministering- poison, and the residents
of St. Helena were\ so enraged by th<*
: n-rr" i'l-nlnn that the suspected
assassin was removed to the County
Jail at Napa for his own safety. All
the circumstances of the crime Indicate
that It was deliberately planned and
coolly carried out.
W. A. Clark arose as usual at about
5 o'clock this morning and proceeded
to prepare his breakfast, according to
his usual custom. A few minutes later
his son-in-law, George W. Day, heard
what appeared to be the report of a
pistol. He did not arise to investi
gate. However, Mrs. Clark, hearing
a nnlFe similar to that of a person
struggling, went to the kitchen. There
upon the floor, weltering in his own
blood, lay her husband. His head was
Inside the room, and close to the end
of the kitchen table: his feet were upon
the door rasing while close to hid hips
lay his pipe. Near his feet, but on
the porch, lay a 32-caliber revolver, stil!
smoking from the shot that had been
fired. There was a ghastly wound just
over and to the left of the left eye.
showing whir-re the bullet had entered.
Mrs. Clark aroused the household and
caused her hushand to be placed upon
a lounge.. A physician was summoned.
Mr. Clark never spoke after being shot.
Dr. Osborne arriv<J'. upon the scene, but
his services were of no avail, so he noti
fied Marshal Johnson.
George W. Clark, a brother of the
murdered man, sleeps in a room on
I >r. Osborne's premises, and the Mar
shal, accompanied by the doctor and
Charles Jackson, proceeded to the place
and placed the man under arrest. He
appeared very much surprised at his
brother's death and protested his in
nocence, saying that his brother had
committed suicide.
The officer, how-
ever, noticed that Clark's shoes had
i fresh mud on them, although the man
* raid he had not left his room since the
night before. The shoes exactly fitted
the tracks leading from his cottage to
the home of his brother.
George Clark formerly lived with his
brother William, but was ordered from
the place on suspicion of having placed
poison in the latter's coffee. On two
occasions William Clark narrowly
escaped death from poisoning. In each
Instance the coffee had been poisoned.
An examination showed the coffee to
contain strychnine sufficient to kill a
dozen men. The affair was myster
ious, and George was accordingly or
dered from the place until the matter
was cleared up. George begged to be
allowed to go back, but was refused.
YT. A. Blngbam to-day identified the
pistol found on the porch as one he
had sold to George Clark a few days
ago. Lou Pritchard said he gave
irge a bottle of strychnine some
time ago to kill mice -with.
A Call reporter interviewed Mrs.
Clark, and she said of her husband:
"If he had an enemy outside of his
brother I don't know it."
Peter York, on his way to work
shortly after 5 o'clock, p-<y a man run
ning in the direction of George Clark's
room.
William Anderson Clark was a na
tive of Ohio, 43 years of age. In addi
tion to the widow, he leaves seven chil
dren, who are destitute. Clark was a
quiet and industrious man, and has
lived in St. Helena eight years. His
brother George is a cranky, disagree-
able fellow and hard to get along with.
The Jail was guarded by officers all
day, and in the afternoon the prisoner
was sent to the county seat. A Coro
ner's Jury was immediately impaneled,

the Inquest was postponed until Sat-

flclent evidence to convict George
Clark of the murder of his brother.
NAPA. Jan. 20.â George Willard
Clark, who was arrested at St. Helena
this morning: for the murder of his
brother. William Anderson Clark, was
brought down to the county Jail this
afternoon by Sheriff McKenzle. He
was seen this afternoon and said:
"I have lived fn California for about
eleven years. I have been In Xapa
County for over blx years. I have been
a Christian for more than five years,
having first Joined the Methodist
church, then the Salvation Army. Later
I reunited with the Methodist church,
but now I belong to the Seventh-day
Adventists. As God is my witness, this
is the first crime of which I have ever
been accused. I protest my innocence
and shall fight the case to the last.
Would I murder my brother? Never! I
have my suspicion as to the murderer,
but I will not divulge It. lam 37 years
of age and was born in Ohio. Last
night I retired to bed between 9 and 10
o'clock, after attending prayer-meet
ing. I room at Dr. Osborne's, in St.
Helena, and have roomed there since
my brother and I had a falling out.
some time ago. The only thing I know
is that early this morning, between 6
and 7 o'clock, City Marshal Johnson
called at my rooms and stated that he
wanted me. I was surprised, but sur
rendered readily. I was taken to the
local jail and there was visited by three
Christian friends before noon. These
friends expressed their belief in my in
nocence and will contribute their aid
to my defense. God will see me through
in this matter."
""Were you near your brother's resi
dence last night?" was asked.
"No, I was not," he replied.
"How about the footprints that cor
respond with yours?"
"I know nothing about them. I am
innocent."
"How about the attempted poisoning
of your brother on two different occa
sions last month? Do you know any
thing about it?"
"I did not do it, as God knows. I told
you I had had suspicions against a cer
tain person. I have told the officers
whom I suspect. I shall be proven in
nocent at my trial. My brother also
suspected another."
"Were there ever rumors that you
were unduly intimate with your
brother's wife?"
"Such rumors are false. They are
monstrous. My brother and I had
trouble and I left his house, but not
over differences of that sort. Nothing
of such a horrible character ever oc
curred."
The prevailing opinion at St. Helena
is that George Clark is the guilty man.
He is of dark complexion, medium
stature and has a dark mustache. He
looked The Call representative square
in the face as he remarked: "I am
both sorry and glad over this tragic
affair. lam sorry my brother has been
murdered and I am glad that I am in
nocent." He was particularly inquisi
tive about the appearance of his
brother_after_death, and when told was
very much affected*. He" seems little
dejected behind the bars of the County
Jail and appears to trust in the Lord.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 20.â
Senator Bacon of Georgia to
day followed his action of yes
terday In offering an amend
ment to the treaty providing for
a vote upon it by the people of
Hawaii by offering the amend
ment to Senator Morgan's bill
for annexation, thus making the
amendment public. It is as fol
lows:
"That this act shall not be op
erative and of binding effect
upon either the United States of
America or the Republic of Ha
waii until the same shall have
been consented to and approved
by the majority of the voters
voting at an election to be held
in the Hawaiian Islands, at
which election all male natives
of said islands of the age of 21
years, and all naturalized male
persons of the a?e of 21 years
shall be qualified voters. Said
election to be held at a time and
in the manner and under regu
lations to be prescribed by the
President of th-? United States."
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Jan. 20.
This has been a bad day for the Ha
waiian annexationists. In an unmis
takable test of their strength they find
they have been performing that act so
familiar in politics and legislation of
counting their chickens before they are
hatched. Feeling secure In the stories
Of their invincibility, which had beon
carried to them by their runners Inside
r.nd outside the Senate, the men who
are engineering the annexation scheme
determined upon a coup which was ex
pected to show their strength, and the
result was a pair of black eyes for an
nexation.
For days the annexationlsts have
been prating about the growth In an
nexation sentiment which has been
developing in the Senate. They talked
so much about it they began to believe
It themselves, and when It was decid
ed to make a showing they fell into
the trap they had set for themselves.
It all came about in this way: Senator
Vest gave notice yesterday that he
would call up for consideration to-day
the resolutions which bear the name In
legislative history of the late Stanley
Matthews of Ohio, and which declare
in so many words that it would not be
repudiation to pay the coin bonds of
the United States in standard silver
dollars. Pursuant to that notice given
yesterday. Senator Vest, at what is
known as the conclusion of the morn
ing business of the Senate, rose to
make his motion. Before he could se
cure recognition, Senator Lodge of
Massachusetts, one of the most ardent
of annexationists. Jumped to the front
with a motion that the Senate proceed
to the consideration of executive busi
ness. That meant, of course, the fur
ther consideration of the Hawaiian
question.
It has developed that the annexa
tionists have been humping to them
selves the delusion that in the hearts
of all those who talked favorably
about annexation this Hawaiian ques
1 tion was uppermost and that the sll
' ver Senators of the West and some of
the Eastern men on the Democratic
side would put Hawaii above silver or
anything else. It was to show this
they determined upon the test. They
believed a majority of the Senate
would promptly go on record as in fa
vor of the consideration of the treaty
rather than thresh over old straw on
: the money and bond question, and they
! were foolish enough to boast of their
! supposed power before the Senate con
vened. The result was disastrous to
' their hopes. By a vote of 39 to 27 the
j Senate determined that It did not care
to go into executive session Just then,
and later, by the decisive vote of 41 to
25. the body decided to proceed with
the consideration of the bonds resolu
! tion. Senator Vest held it there until
| he made the men on the other side of
the chamber agree that it should be re
' garded as the unfinished business of
the Senate and should have the right
of way, and then he consented to the
executive session.
And instead of. making: a coup that
would help them, the annexationists
made a bad break. That is particu
larly manifest to-night in the an-
nouncement that has gone put to
friends of the treaty to play for de
lay. They are by no means as cer
tain as they have been of their ulti
mate success and so they have deter-

REDDING. Jan. 20.â While on her
way home from school late this after
noon Mary Chrlstensen was shot twice
by Sam Shields, a lover whose infatu
ation was not reciprocated. She had
reached the alley between Court and
Oregon streets, on the West Side, when
she was met by Shields, who said:
"Mollie, I am going: to kill you."
The girl attempted to ward off the
pistol, while pleading: "O, don't do
that: for God's sake, don't do that."
"Without heeding her entreaties, the
wretch fired point blank in her face,
the ball cutting an ugly gash in her
cheek.
"With blood streaming over her
clothes the girl fled toward her home,
screaming: "I am shot. O, I am
killed."
Her murderous assailant then ran up
behind her and fired again, the ball
striking her in the left shoulder and
coming out above the breast. This shot
set her clothing afire. The third shot
did not take effect.
James N. Logan Jr., District Attor
ney Rose, John E. Reynolds and Night
Watchman Johnson ran to her assist
ance and disarmed her assailant.
The young woman is staying at the
home of Mr. and Mrs. James N. Logan
Jr., whither she was carried. Her
wounds are not dangerous. Shields was
locked up in the County Jail. He at
tempted suicide b^ taking laudanum,
but succeeded in swallowing only a few
drops. He Is a shoemaker by trade, in
the employ of W. P. Buck, and is a
man of about 35 or 40 years of age.
Miss Christensen is a daughter of Colin
Christensen, an expert accountant of
Gas Point. Shields first became ac
quainted with the young woman in
that section.
James N. Logan Jr. says that Miss
Christensen complained of Shields' at
tentions and he ordered him off the
premises. , It was feared that Shields
might attempt something desperate,
and Marshal Eckels was warned. Lo
gan also spoke to Shields' employer,
but he considered him a harmless fel
low. Several months ago Shields wrote
an anonymous letter to the girl's
mother, making slanderous accusa
tions. The mother forwarded the let
ter to her daughter, who is 16 years of
age and one of the brightest pupils in
the public schools of Redding. A few
days since she carried off a 110 prize
for making the most changes in the
sentence "Homeward the plowman
plods his weary way," in "Gray's Ele
gy."
Had the young girl been fatally
wounded her slayer would not have
lived till morning, and as it Is, threats
of lynching are freely and openly
made in all quarters of town. Shields
is fearful that he may be lynched. He
submitted to Interviews, but could not
be prevailed upon to tell why he had
shot the girl.
HARRY WINTERS'
DOOM IS SEALED
Sentenced by Judge Buck to Be

Until Dead.
Motion for New Trial Denied â The
Condemned Man Has Nothing
to Say.
Special Plopatch to The Call.
REDWOOD CITY, Jan. 20 âIn the Su
perior Court at this place this morning
Judge Buck pronounced the death sen
tt-nci' upon Harry Winters, one of the
murderers of C. A. Andrews. Before
court convened the entire seating ca
pacity of the courtroom was full to over
flowing, even to the jury box, and stand-
Ing room was at a premium.
At 10 o'clock Sheriff Mansfield brought
the prisoner handcuffed to the courtroom.
He looked pale and worried, but kept
composed during the trying ordeal of the
passing of the death sentence.
Attorney Nagle asked the Court to de
fer passage of sentence for a month, in
order to allow him to move for a new
trial. This the Court refused to do.
Nagie then made his motion for a new
trial Â«m the statutory grounds and also
moved an arrest of judgment. The Court
refused both motions.
Winters was then told to stand up,
and was asked if he had anything to say
why the sentence of the court should not
be passed upon him. He had nothing to
say, contrary to the expectations of all
present in the courtroom. The Judge
then sentenced him to be hanged by the
neck until dead, and tho time for carry
ing out the sentence was fixed for April
8 next.

NO WATER
TO FIGHT
THE FIRE
Los Angeles Is in Daily
Danger of a Disastrous
Conflagration.
And Still the Allied Villainies oP
the Southern Metropolis Plead
for Delay in Securing
City Water.
"The flre on Pico Heights is an unanswerable plea for the early
settlement of the water question. The three syndicated dailies can
now continue their policy of defending those officials who are block
ing the city's acquisition of its water plant if they wish, but every
time they bolster up procrastination in this matter they are jeopardiz
ing the lives and property of hundreds of people." â From an interview
with Mayor M. P. Snyder of Los Angeles.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 20.â The people
of Los Angeles to-day had the fact
brought forcibly home to them that
the water service of this city now
given by the Los Angeles Water Com
pany was not only inadequate, but the
further fact that such of the pipes and
mains as the company had in operation
were out of repair, worn out and not
fit for a village of 5000 people. Owing
to the fact that not even ordinary gar
den-hose pressure could be obtained
through the water mains on Pico
Heights, one of the most Imposing
school buildings in the city is a mass
of smoldering ruins and the lives of
hundreds of innocent school children
were jeopardized. The homes of the
substatial worklngmen who reside on
Pico Heights, one of the most closely
populated residence districts of the
city, were all in danger at one time of
being consumed by the conflagration,
and two of them were .reduced to
ashes as it was.
It was 2:15 this afternoon when the
flre alarm was turned in. The fire
started in the school building in which
there were some 200 school children.
The blaze was fortunately discovered
early and the little ones were marched
out in safety, without panic. The build
ing was an eight-roomed, two-story
structure, and the loss to the city is
$10,000.
As a high wind was prevailing and
the firemen, who turned out promptly,
had absolutely no water to work with.
the flames spread to the adjoining cot
tages and three of them were con
sumed. The Chief of the Fire Depart
ment was forced to send two miles to
Vermont avenue to cause the water to
be turned on. in the old zanja, a relic
of the adobe days. It then percolated
down near the scene of the conflagra
tion. In the bed of an old creek, wells
were dug and here in the holes the
water collected. The fire engines were
usd to pump the water upon the flames
and thus was a spread prevented and
the Pico Heights district saved from
devastation.
As to the inadequacy of the water
service, the Chief of the Fire Depart
ment, Walter S. Moore, said to-night:
"With the pressure of an ordinary gar
den hose we coaild have saved the three
residences. But we absolutely could
not get water in buckets to prevent
the sparks from igniting the houses
adjoining. We finally dug wells in the
bed of an old creek and thereby cut off
the flames as soon as we could get the
water forced by our engines."
The water service in that district is
a disgrace to the city. The homes of
hundreds of working men are entirely
at the mercy of any fire that may
start. If th 3 flames had not been dis
covered when they were, so that chil
dren could be marched out of the
sehoolhouse, there would have been a
frightful catastrophe.
Yet in the face of this presentation
the syndicated press of Los Angeles is
advising delay in the settlement of the
water question. The three combined
dailies advocate a policy of procrasti
nation when, if the city were to come
into the possession of its property on
July 22 next, it could at once proceed to
improve the plant so -that every por
tion of the city would be adequately
protected.
The sentiment and feeling of thou
sands of taxpayers Is voiced by Mayor
M. P. Snyder, who this <â  -<ning said:
"The fire on Pico Heights is an un
answerable plea for the early settle-
I ment of the water question. The three
syndicated dailies can now continue
\ their policy of defending those officials
| who are blocking the city's acquisition
iof its water plant if they wish, but
every time they bolster up procrasti
nation in this matter they are Jeopar
dizing the lives and property of hun
dreds of people. Until the water ques
; tion is settled we can not have an ade
quate service for this city. The longer
settlement Is delayed, the longer we
will be without it.
"Every day of delay that could be
avoided by the City Council taking up
this question and treating it intelligent
ly, honestly and fearlessly as represen
tatives of the people and not as special
pleaders of the water company would
be a great boon to the people. Just
think of those innocent school children
whose lives were in danger this after
noon. Why, the contemplation Is ap
palling. If anything was needed to
arouse the people to action, my opinion
is that Providence has sent that thing.
"For this old, battered, worn-out, de
pleted plant, with forcible evidence of
its inadequacy at hand, the water com
pany asks 13,000,000 of the city
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
â has the audacity to endeavor
to either mulct the people of
close on to $2,000,000 or to force a
renewal of its lease and a continuation
of the present water service, which is
a disgrace to the city."
Councilman Edward L. Hutchinson,
in discussing the matter, said: "Con
sidering the fact that almost every
residence in this city is built of wood,
that all the school buildings but two
are huge wooden structures, that many
of the so-called business blocks are of
wood, that most of the flats and tene
ments of the city are of wood and that
many of the buildings wherein great
crowds assemble for purposes o>?
amusement are of wood, and the ad
ditional and appalling fact that most of
the water mains are of two-inch pipe,
making the facilities for coping with
conflagrations absolutely inadequate,
it is almost miraculous the fire demon
has not already wiped us from the face
of the earth. It is fortunate for the
hundreds of pupils who escaped death
at Pico Heights to-day that the teach
ers of this city have long recognized
the supreme danger and have frequent
ly drilled the children systematically
for just such emergencies. If the city
water company and the syndicated sy*
cophants of the press manage to con
trol the water supply of this city much
longer a special â¢fire drill" should be ar
ranged for the grown people who con
gregate in buildings where there is
hardly enough water to drink, to say
nothing of extinguishing conflagra
tions."
"By the way, what has become of
nearly all the huge wooden hotels that
ornamented this city a few years ago?
Wood-built cities that are careless of
water vanish sooner or later. Our
buildings are as dry as powder houses
and almost as inflammable. When a
holocaust occurs here, as it surely will
occur, I should not like to answer for the
City Water Company, for its syndicate
press nor for those who aid and abet
them in their nefarious schemes to keep
this fair and flourishing city from hav
ing one of the finest and most econom
ical and efficient water systems in thÂ«
world."
INWARDNESS OF THE
GREAT CONSPIRACY TO
FLEECE THE PEOPLE.
Powerful Combine to Dispose of a Compara-
tively Worthless VJater Plant and
Control City Politics.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 20.â Each new
disclosure made in connection with the
Issues that have grown out of the
School Board scandals shows clearly
that a powerful and unscrupulous ring
has been endeavoring for more than a
ye ar past to secure control of the gov
ernment of the city of Los Angeles.
Back of all the peculiar manipulation
that has been going on is the powerful
corporation which is now seeking to
unload upon the people of Los Angeles
a rust-eaten and otherwise worthless
water plant at nearly three times its
actual value, namely, the Los Angeles
City Water Company. Its plan of op
eration has been shrewd and subtle.
It has also had as able allies the Los
Angeles Lighting Company, the Los
Angeles Electric Company and the Loa
Angeles Electric Railway Company.
Realizing the importance of securing
the support of or gagging the local
press their first efforts were put forth
in this direction. The Herald and Ex
press were brought under the domina
tion of these corporations by direct pur
chase of an interest in them. From all
that can be learned the money for this
investment was provided by the Los
Angeles City Water Company. Just
how the support of the Times in behalf
of these corporations and the objects
which they are seeking to accomplish
was obtained is not definitely known,
but numberless residents do not hesi
tate to fix the price for which the influ
ence of the Times was purchased. The
figures vary from the price of a small
advertisement to a rÂ«speetable sum in
cash.
With the three papers mentioned thus
virtually forced to talk with the tongue
of the Los Angeles Water Company and
its allied cvorporations, the next step
in the great conspiracy to rob the peo
ple of Los Angeles of their money and
their rights as free-born citizens was
easily taken. This was the formation
of an organization dubbed the League
for Better City Government, C. D. T,Vil
lard being used to make the prelimin
ary arrangements. This organization,
while being coddled and nursed by the
Times-Herald-Express syndicate into
vigorous life as an ostensible purifier of
local politics, Was simply laying tha
ground work for capturing the city2
government, and more particularly the
Council, in the Interests of the Los An
geles City Water Company. This it
would in all probability bave succeced
ed in doing had not Th.' Call entered
upon the field, made a thorough Inves
tigation of the Bituatton and shown
how these three forcesâ the syndicated
Times-Herald-Express, the League for
Better City Government and. the Los
Angeles City Water Company and its
allied corporations- were all acting in
unison to accomplish one object, the
fleecing 'if the public.
Had not this powerful and menda
cious coalition attempted to bring
.â  the political ruin of Walter L.
Webb n might have succeeded in its
primary object It looked upon Webb,
however, as a serious obstacle to the
carrying out of its future plans. As
lias already been set forth in The Call.
the }>â :>>â  of the Los Angeles City Water
Company expires <>n July 20 of this
year. No one believes for a moment
that any settlement will be arrived at
between the city and this corporation
in reference to the price to be paid the
latter for its improvements. Delay has
the watchword of the water com
pany, and delay it will seek to obtain
by every moans available until the
n^xt election. At this election the
Mater company's plan is to elect a
Mayor and Council that will carry out
its behests. In this plan, it is said, it
Is to be aided by the syndicated jour
nals already mentioned and by the
League for Better City Government.
As a member of the Board of Educa
tion, Webb, who had received the in
ment of the League for Better
City Government, refused to be a par
ty to the organization of the board in
the interests i C the League. This made
him a marked man. He showed himself
tan of strong characteristics
f great political acumen. He re
fused to be dominated or coerced by
the league. For this display of inde
pendeni spirit he was pui to the rack.
Charged by the league with corruption
in office, be was tried before the Supe
rior Court on an accusation to remove
him from office, and was acquitted by
a jury in less than twelve minutes af
ter the case was submitted. He is now
under investigation on a similar charge
id of Education. In this
Investigation all the testimony has
been taken, and not a Bingle witness,
â  I two self-confessed perjurers,
led to anything that places
U.iiii even under a suspicion of having
corrupt.
While the league was carrying out
its part of the general scheme in direct-
Ing the ! a of Webb, the
Express combination did
not flinch for a sinsie day from its Im
part. Even before Webb was put
his arrival he was vilified, con
demned and persecuted In every way
familiar to the most saffron of yellow
jouri.
It was no secret among Webb's
friends and constituents that in ac
cepting a place in the Board of Edu
cation he was simply going into train
ing for the pur: '.king the liu r ht
: ouncilman from the Ninth Ward
in th . to be held next Decem
ber. This it was, in connection with
his i; .' attitude, t,hat caused
him to be singled out for slaughter by
tins giant and unmerciful ring, con
; of the combined corporations,
the tripartite newspaper syndicate and
the 1.- tor Better city Govern
ment. The result of this nefarious
plan is now history.
A short but significant interview in
this connection was had with Frank A.
; surer of the League for
Better City Government, and cashier
of the First National Rank. Gibson
was also one of the original ten who
composed the committee on organiza
whlch ultimately i reated the
League for Better City (government.
It is common report that Frank A.
Gibson holds as trustee for the Los
City Water Company large
ock in both the Herald and
Express. With a view to ascertaining
what ground there was for this rumor,
special correspondent inter
i Mr. Gibson.
"I'm you hold, as trustee, stock in the
â I and Express newspapers?"
Asked the correspondent.
"I do, and enough to be elected a di
rector," answered Mr. Gibson.
"Do you hold that stock as trustee
for th- Los Angeles City Water Com
pany or for any one or more of the
kholders in the \\nÂ«er company?"
\t :;sk>-d.
"My trust relations are a matter of
Strict confidence between myself and
th>=> people whom I represent," was the
nmittal reply.
It Is not amiss to call attention to the
latter answer of Mr. Gibson. Were he
r.ot holding stock in the papers men
. as trustee for the Los Angeles
City Water Company, he could have
answered with a simple "No," without
ng any confidence.
To even the most casual reader the
result of this interview will show the
apparent close relationship between
the Los Anireles City Water Company,
the local press and the League for
Better City Government. It must be
furtlK-r st.:ted that C. D. Willard. one
of the most active spirits in the league,
is manager of the Express: that T. E.
Gibbon, .-mother league leader, and one
of the attorneys who prosecuted Webb,
is an officer of the Herald Publishing
â¢my, while the Times is repre
sented in t*ie league by two active
workers, L. E. Mosher, formerly di
rector of the league, and Harry Chand
ler, one of the three illegally elected
directors of the league. g

Wants to Retain En

Requests That He Be Permitted

Five Weeks.
Muc^ Valuable Data Now Being Se
cured by the Parties In
â¢ the Field.
Special Dispatch to The Call.*
NEW YORK. Jan. 20.â The Herald's
correspondent with the United States
; Nicaraguan Canal Commission in a
dispatch from Managua, says: The ca
i nal commission desires to request the
; authorities in Washington through the
Herald to allow Civil Engineer Meno
cal. who has been ordered to return to
the United States in connection with
i defects in dry dock No. 3 at Brooklyn,
to remain with the party for at least
five weeks. The commission points out
\ that this is most important in order to
continue the work, as Mr. Menocal's
presence is necessary. It is asserted
that British influence has been thrown
against the canal project by the direc
tors of the London Bank of Central
America, because of a difference be
tween the bank and Government, grow
ing out of the contract. Congress has
declared as illegal the change of name
of the bank in Nicaragua to the Lon
don Bank of Central America.
The Herald's correspondence from
Greytown, Nicaragua, dated January
4, says: The work of the canal com
mission is proceeding The party
to be disbursed and provisioned and
assigned to various features of the
work and stations on the canal line is
I far larger than that of any previous
commission. This part of the work
has been accomplished, however, and
the delay of the present and past few
days has been caused principally by
conditions of the weather. The New
port has forty laborers obtained at
Port Limon. As soon as these are
landed by means of a surf tug the
commission will procure a steamer and
begin its journvy to points up the river,
distributing laborers along the canal
route, where they are much needed for
the purpose of clearing the line that
the hydrographic and topographic work
may be expedited.
Ruined machinery near the mouth
of the canal still lies where the last
commission found it. Big Panama
dredges lie in the water looking fully
their age. The canal opening is in
very good condition. The width has
been maintained and the banks show
: nothing but stability. The rainfall has
i been almost incessant, and this coupled
; with the rise of the San Juan put Grey
town nearly under water for a few
days. Parties in camps have been
having wet work, with the exception
of those whitfi are working on the line
of the canal between Lake Nicaragua
and the Pacific. They sleep under
thatched roofs in the camps, construct
ed by laborers. Many of the parties
are miles from each other, and some
are in places where life is not very
, pleasant. One engineer, for instance.
Is in a spot where he can be reached
only by boat, attended only by a cook
and a laborer. Eleven parties will
secure a vast amount of data In the
way of gauging of streams and rivers,
observations of rainfall, borings, etc.,
and their findings added to the data
of the canal company will give the
commission material for a more satis
factory report on the feasibility and
practicability of the canal than, has
ever been made. A satisfactory re
port as to the proposed works leading
up to the summit level of the canal can
only be made by having complete data
as to action of all waters, and by
which missing material will be ob
tained. Unless all signs fall the com
mission will have this.

Indemnity.

Bpectal Dltpatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE. Jan. 20.â E. A. Brown,
the HolliÃter farmer who was beaten
and robbed of $390 about two weeks
ago, only escaped death by a narrow
margin to fall into the hands of the
Philistines.
Isaac Irwln, who assaulted and
! robbed Brown, was captured a few
; days later, an* the entire amount of
â  money stolen was recovered. Brown
' was Joyous over recovering his wealth,
but this did not last long, for he was
presented with a batch of biils arising
i out of the robbery. Mrs. Sager, the
I landlady of the house where the crime
I occurred, has sued Brown for $100
damage done to the room, and City
Physician Hablutzel has sued him for
$30 for dressing his wounds at the Re
ceiving Hospital, while Chief Kidward
has also asked him to pay a bill of
$24 75 for telegraphing and sending out
' postal cards bearing a description of
Irwin.
Brown denounces all these bills as
exorbitant, and this opinion is shared
;by many citizens of San Jose. A great
deal of discussion has been caused by
the matter. Brown offered Mrs. Sagv'r
$5 for the damage done her room by
I the blood that was spilled on the
! sheets, but she spurned this amount
and secured District Attorney Her
i rington as her counsel and sued Brown
j for $100.
In Justice Gass' court to-day Brown
> filed an answer to the suit and de
j manded an itemized bill. An itemized
I account has also been demanded of
| City Physician Hablutzel, who simply
| bandaged up Brown's head. The City
I Physician receives $75 per month for
i attending to Just such cases, and peo
ple are wondering why he should pre
sent Brown with a $30 bill. Brown has
also refused to pay the bill of Chief
Kidward of $24, and has declared he
will fight all the suits to a finish.
At present Brown's money is tied up
in the hands of the Sheriff by attach
, ment proceedings.

SACRAMENTO. Jan. 20.â The Aud
iting Board to the Commisafonera "f
Public "Works met this afternoon at
the Capitol, with Chairman Corcoran
and a full board in attendance.
Major Heuer of the Qovernment En
gineering Corps ..n the Pacific Coast
was present and i atered into a con
tract with the board whereby he be
comea a consulting engineer to the
Commissioners of Public Works. At
no time in the history <>f California
has there been such close relations as
now exist between the State and Fed
eral authorities in the matter of riyÂ«_-r
improvements.
Major Heuer was somewhat reluc
tant In his acceptance of the board's
proposition to employ him as consult
ing engineer, but was prevailed upon
to accept, and to sustain Ins right to
act in that capacity an abstract of
the United States statutes was re
ferred to. The major remained
in consultation with the board
during the afternoon, and dur
ing the brief period of his participa
tion in to-day's meeting it was shown
that a most decided advantage will
come from hla Identification with the
.State Department of Public Works.
Commissioner Leake was very much
elated over th>- arrangement and ex
pressed himself as follows: "Things
a:-- certainly coming o;.r way in river
matters, and by this arrangement with
Major Heuer our department will not
only have the benefit of advice from
one of the most competent civil en
gineers of the I'nited States, but in
addition to that we are most fortunate
in securing the services of a man who
has made a study of river matters in
California and is familiar with every
phase of the auestl
The following petition was received
from residents along the river adja
cent to the city of Marysville.
\V", the undersigned land owners of
Sutter and I'olus.i counties, believing it
to !â â¢â  of immediate benefit to the Sacra
mento River and to the lands adjacent
thereto t., have weirs construi I
Butte Slough .uju Tladale Break up to thy
height of the n&Mtr&J bank, earnestly re
quest, if there are funds at your
command to he used for the Im] i
nu-nt of draining, that some portion be
to build said weirs and the work
prosecuted.
The petition was presented by A. E,
Bingham of Mu;ysvi!le. who personally
advanced arguments favoring the pro
ject.
A communication was received in the
shape of an agreement on the part of
the farmers on the Yolo side of the
Sacramento River to construct !â 
In front of their land fronting on the
Sacramento liiver, and to complete the
same on or before October 1, ISM, in
accordance with th# report of the Com
missioner of Public Works, and of such
a height and dimensions as he may
recommend, the agreement being made
conditional upon the building of ease
ments or overflow weirs and not to
become binding upon the resident own
ers until the Auditing Hoard to the
Commission of Public Works agrees to
build the same.
J. (). Coleman presented the matter
and stated that the farmers were will
ing and anxious to maintain their
levees at a proper height, provided the
board would construct weirs or ease
ments. The board ordered the engi
neers to locate the most advantageous
plans to establish the easements.
A communication was received from
Attorney-General FitzLr>>rald giving his
opinion upon the following resolution:
Resolved, That th<; Attorney-General be
request*'! to adv!>e this board whether
the Stato would be liable for damages if
an overflow weir !s constructed by the
Commission of Public Works by ai.d with
the consent of this board on the right or
west bank of the Sacramento River,
which weir or easement would carry the
surplus water "f said rivÂ» r above the
twenty-four and one-half foot stage at
Sacramento into the adjacent county.
The Attorney-General In reply says:
"I am of the "pinion that this work
should be construct, d under the act
providing for the appointment of the
Auditing Board to. the Commissioners
of Public Works, approved March 17,
1897, and In particular ur.dc-r section 5
of said act."
The board then adjourned to the Su
preme Court chamber, where a delega
tion from Marysville had assembled to
ascertain what would be the policy and
action of the Auditing Board on river
improvement in the future.
Mr. Stone of Marysville, chairman of
the last river convention, stated the ob
ject of the visiting delegation.
Chairman Corcoran briefly outlined
the work already undertaken by the
board, and said that contracts had al
ready been made to remove the New
ton nhoals and arrangements made by
which the farmers on the Yolo side
would build up their levees, and the
board would then construct weirs or
easements to permit the tide of high
water to flow into the Yolo basin.
Mr. Parks of Marysville arose and
remarked that his people would like to
know what the sentiment of the board
was regarding the purchase and em
ployment of dredgers.
Captain Hall expressed himself as
favoring a- dredger, provided the river
could not be relieved through the ope
ration of the water by confining it in
narrow channels by means of Jetties,
as already contracted for.
Senator Doty made a vigorous de
fense of the board and declared that
the resolutions of censure passed by the
river convention were uncalled for. He
said he would favor a dredger when
ever the necessity arose. He was fol
lowed by Tatterson and Markley, who
proclaimed themselves along the same
lines. ,' r *>.."-

There is. however, no official confirma
tion in either case.
BERLIN, Jan. L'O.â A significant ar
ticle in the Cologne Gazette asserts
that, according to international law,
Kiaochau is German property, and an
attack upon it would enable Emperor
William to declare war without con
sulting the liundesrath. The paper says.
furthermore, that being leased terri
tory, Ui a political sense, it remains as
before, foreign territory. Therefore
commercial and customs treaties be
tween either China and European
States or between Oermanf and other
i. at ions have no validity there, and
consequently foreign states cannot ap
peal to the favored nation clause or
claim similar rights to those granted
Germany, while Germany Is in a posi

mercial relations quite unreservedly if
she thinks lit.
VICTORIA, B. C. Jan. 20.â There is
no truth in the report sent from here
yesterday that the flagship Imperieuse
and other vessels of the Esquimalt

make ready for a hurried trip to South

countermanded.
PLAY FOR
DELAY UPON
ANNEXATION
Continued from First Page.
mined upon delay In order to bring
into closer communion some of those
whom they thought they could control,
but who swerved off to-day, and also
certain Republicans who voted against
the Vest motion because they are con
sistent gold men and represent gold
constituents. Among these are lfor
rill. Spooner, Thurston and Gear. They
are working on these men through the
White House and at the same time
back home with their constituents. This
explains the action of the lowa Leg
islature In declaring for the treaty.
That deal was engineered by the ad
ministration leaders here to drive
Gear Into line. The same tactics are
to be resorted to wherever it is neces
sary, especially so, it is said here, in
"Wisconsin.
During the executive session of to
day, there was an informal conference
of the men who are regarded as the
leaders for annexation and it was the
unanimous opinion of all that they will
have to go hlow. The result is there
are to be more speeches from the
friends of the treaty than were at first
scheduled. There is to be a play for
delay and no vote on the treaty need
be expected for weeks yet; that is, un
less the Dole visit pans out better than
is expected.
A good deal of reliance is placed upon
the part which President Dole, with the
aid of President McKinley. will be able
to play. This Dole visit is to be a grand
stand effort to convert some of the
weak-kneed and doubtful Senators.
President Dole is to be made much of. A
certain amount of courtesy 1b of course
necessary to the Chief Executive of a
friendly country, but the extreme limit
is to be played in this case.
Some of the details of the proposed
visit have already been given out. To
morrow the delegation, consisting o-f Mr.
Cridler of the State Department. Major
!!â¢ istiind of the army and Commander
Phelpsof the navy, will leave Washing
ton for Chicago, where they will meet
and receive President Dole in behalf of
the President of the United States. The
Governor of Illinois and the Mayor o-f
Chicago will participate in the recep
tion there, and there will be a military
escort and all that.
Here in Washington the annexation
newspapers have started a movement
toward the decoration of Pennsylvania
avenue in honor of Dole's coming, and
in every way is the visit to be made
imposing and impressive. All of this
is for effect on the doubtful members
of the Senate. They are to be shown
that Dole is as big a man as McKin
ley, and they are expected to forget
their objections in the general rejoicing
and demonstrations of brotherly love.
If this should have the desired effect,
a vote may be pressed while things are
hot. If not. President Dole will stay
and will make it convenient to explain
to as many of the doubters as he can
see how badly this country needs those
islands. Of coarse, it is not meant to
insinuate that the President of the Ha
waiian republic co-mes here for the pur
pose of lobbying with the Senate. Some
people here are strongly inclined to
think that is the case, but such sugges
tions are unkind. Mr. Dole is coming on
a purely philanthropic mission.
To-day Senator Bacon introduced an
amendment to Senator Morgan's an
nexation bill, which has caused much
discussion. As The Call has shown, the
senior Senator from Georgia is one of
the most active opponents of annexa
tion in the Senate. In the executive
consideration of the measure he has
taken a strong stand against the treaty
and has laid stress upÂ«.-n the necessity
of getting at the real sentiment of the
Hawaiian people. He has submitted an
amendment to the treaty very much in
the same language as is embodied in
the bill amending the Morgan bill,
which he introduced to-day
The sentiment against the treaty
seems to be growing. For a time im
mediately after Congress met, and
while there was much talk of parti
tion of China among the European na
tions, there was an apparent increase
of talk favorable to the treaty, but all
the recent developments have been on
the old line. Hawaii is not as strong
now as it was then. The chances for
annexation seem to grow leea as the
conditions and the resnonsibilties in
volved are discussed. Senator Carter
gave utterance to a statement during
open debate in the Senate which is
widely commented upon to-night. He
was pleading for the early passage of
his bill providing for taking the next
census. The opposition urged that the
time of the Senate for the next ten
days would probably be taken up with
the consideration of the Hawaiian
treaty, and Senator Carter retorted,
warmly:
"I do not know what the views of
the Committee on Foreign Relations
may be concerning the time at which
a final vote may be taken on that im
portant measure, but it is not reason
able to suppose that the vote will be
taken before the first of February. It
may be the first of June before that
vote is tak^n."
Senator Morgan concluded his four
days' speech to the Senate to-day on
the Hawaiian treaty. He spoke for al
most four hours, and when he finished
there were not more than half a dozen
Senators present. He discussed, among
other questions, the character of the
present Government of Hawaii. He
contended that the disposition of the
whites was to treat the natives liber
ally and saJd in reply to a question
from Senator Hoar that there was one
native in President Dole's Cabinet and
five natives in the Senate, while a ma
jority of the members of the House
were natives. The Senator read lib
erally from public documents on Ha
waii, including a history of the various
constitutions of the islands. There was
a call for a quorum during the day,
but the Senator remonstrated, saying
he preferred a small audience to the
interruption caused by the call.
Senator Teller took the floor and will
speak when the treaty is next
taken up.
The Senate will next consider the
nomination of Attorney-General Mc-
Kenna to be Associate Justice of the
Supreme Court.

| The members of the board again report that
' Apprentice J. E. Orton, who was recommended
1 by them last quarter for promotion to petty
! officer, third class, on account of his superior
: ability, and who was by permission of the
board rated as apprentice, first Glass, Ib still
worthy of the position of third class gun
ner's mate. Upon his examination he stood 5
I In seamanship, 5 In ordnance and gunnery 5
in conduct and 4.5 In signals. I think it would
j not be inappropriate to rate htm as recom
mended. Whether these apprentices are na
turally brighter than others I cannot say. but
I am led to believe from my observations' that
! with six months on a sailing ship they are
prepared to so on board our new cruisers and
I battleship?.
When torpedoes are overhauled and fired
many of -the boys request permission to be
present in order to become acquainted with
their manipulation. It is very probable that
the example set them by their divisional of
ficers encourages them to persevere. As I be
j lieve that the commanding officer is not au
thorized to rate apprentices higher than the
second class. I respectfully ask that I may
i be permitted to rate the before mentioned ap
j prentices as recommended by the board Very
respectfully. A. S. BARKER,
Captain Commanding.

ANOTHER GAME
FOR SCHAEFER
f
Easily Defeats Sutton at
18-Inch Balkline
Billiards.
Not Sufficiently Handicapped
for the Canadian to Have
a Chance.
Sutton, However, Has a Walkover
, in tho Afternoon Contest
With Spinks.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Jan. 20.â Jacc-b Schaefer
defeated George Sutton to-night in the
IS-inch balkline tournament by a score
of 400 to 195 to-night.
When the handicaps were announced
it was the opinion of most of tb.e fol
lowers of the game that Sutton was
too light, judging by his showing in the
New York tournament. With the pres
ent handicap, the Canadian would have
beaten both Schaefer and Slosson in
the Gotham games. The shortstops,
howev.r, \vÂ» re not willing to be sepa
rated and consequently Sutton was put
<>n the same mark with Spinks and
Catton.
That Ives appreciated the situation
â¢was evident last night, for he went out
from the start to make up his handicap
as quickly as possible. Schaefer tried
to do the same this evening, but tho
balls would not roll kindly for him, and
he could do nothing against the steady
work of the Canadian, who was peg
ging away with an average of over 15.
It was a hard game fur Sutton to
lose, after his good beginning, but he
had no complaint to make. Schaefer
plays Catton to-morrow afternoon, Ives
meeting Spinks in the evening.
Score: Schaefer, 400; average, 21 1-19.
Sutton, total, 195; average, 11 5-15.
George Sutton had an easy thing of
the game this afternoon. He was not
in his best form, but he was able to
run his 260 points while Spinks made
118. Spinks lost his nerve when he
found Sutton was out for business and
his first run was his best, save the sev
enth, during the game.
Third money is still to be fought for,
as the shortstops have each won and
lost a game.
The afternoon score: Suttonâ Total
260: average, 17 1-3. Spinksâ Total, 118 :
average, 8 3-7.

WITNESSED BY DIPLOMATS
Strength of the Big Warship That
Will Increase the Mikado's Power
in the Pacific.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PHILADELPHIA. Jan. 20.â The un
i romantic aspect of Cramps' shipyard
' was changed to-day, when the Japa
nese cruiser Kasagi was launched.
True oriental spirit pervaded the event.
When the breathless moment came,
and the huge ship began to glide down
to her first bath, six doves fluttered
from a basket at the bow, and circling
i about, scattered flowers on the deck.
It was a very pretty piece of mechan
ism and it was not at all incongruous
that the chief actor of the allegory
should be a charming American girl â
Miss Helen Long â daughter of the Sec
retary of the Navy. Miss Long was
merely to have drawn the cord which
released the doves and their floral bur
dens, but at the supreme moment the
cord slipped from her hand, and a
workman of the yard instantly caught
tt and performed the office. This was
observed only by those in immediate
proximity to the vessel, and the beauty
of this unique launch was in no way
marred. The Japanese Minister, Toru
Hoshi, headed the delegation from the
Mikado's court, and apart from those
attached to his staff In Washington
there were Japanese from New York
and .Chicago. The American party
from the capital was large and nota
ble, including many State officials and
their ladies.
The Kasagi Is the most important
ship ever built in the United States for
a foreign country, and is the first for
eign naval craft launched in American
waters since the Russian warship Zo
biaoa, In l v 7v
The dimensions of the Kasagi are:
Length 3744 feet, breadth 48% feet.
depth 30 feet, draught 17 feet 9 Inches,
displacement at that draught (900
tons. she is a protected cruiser of the
second class and like all vessels of h-r
type has no lefensive armor, relying
on her coal bunkers, which run 20f
fore and aft of her midship section, to
protect her engines, which are entirely
below tlv> water line. The motive pow
er is supplied by two vertical Inverted,
triple-expansion, four-cylinder engines,
driving twin screws and tsthnat-d to
develop, under forced draft, a mean
speed of 22 ] i knots per hour. The boiler
rooms contain twelve single - ended
boilers.
The batteries of the Kasagi are heav
ier than those on either the TTnit.-dT T nit .-d
States cruisers Minneapolis or Colum
bia. There are two 8-inch rifles on the
sides and her armament will, in addi
tion, include four 7-inch quick-firing
rifles, a secondary battery of twelve 12
pound quick-firing rifles and six 2-inch
Hotchkiss guns. There are two steel
masts on the Kasagi. These will be
provided with fighting tops, in which
rapid-firing guns will be placed.
The contract for the Kasagi was
signed with representatives of the
Japanese Government December 31.
1^96. and her building was carefully
watched by Commander Katsuro Na
rita, naval attache of the Mikado's
legation at Washington.
Ever since Japan had a navy the
custom of liberating doves has been in
vogue, and yesterday the release of
six doves was intended to symbolize
the happy fruition of a great endeavor
accomplished through the intercession
of white-winged peace.
POSSIBILITY OF RUPTURE
CAUSES APPREHENSIONS.
Relations of Chile and Argentina Yet Suffi

Very Serious.
Copyright. I? 3*. by James Gordon Bennett.
VALPARAISO, Jan. Despite the de
nial of the Chilean Minister in Washing
ton of the possibility of a conflict between !
Argentina and Chile, as I have cabled,
the near possibility of a rupture causes
politicians and merchants grave j appre
hensions. While the war talk has some
what subsided, it is believed that at a
meeting of worUngmen to be held on
Sunday the Government will be forced to ]
show its hand. The Trlbuna confirms the !
news already cabled to the Herald that j
Congress has given the Government full
power to place the country in a state of '
defense and adds that the Government
has been authorized to contract a for
eign loan for this purpose, if necessary.
The Chilean Government is negotiating
with steamship companies trading along
this coast to extend their trips to Monte
video. Uruguay and Rio Janeiro. Brazil.
It is believed that the South American
Company will enter into an agreement to
do this. The same company has decided
to run vessels up the coast to Central
American points. Mr. Stobel, formerly
United States Minister to Chile, left yes

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 21, 1898.
JAPAN'S DOVES OF WAR.
THREE BALLOTS
BUT NO CHOICE
The Maryland Legislature
Unable to Elect a
Senator.
And Now the Outcome Is as
Much in Doubt as at
the Beginning.
Democrats, of Course, Are Prolong
ing the Struggle, but They May-
Support a Republican.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ANNAPOLIS, Md.. Jan. 20.â The
General Assembly of Maryland, in
joint session to-day, took three ballots
for a United Ptates Senator, without
result. The last ballot resulted as fol
lows: McComas 40, Shaw 18, Gorman
47, Findlay 2, Parran 3, Milliken 2,
Shrock â ;. Total 111.
The effect of to-day's work is to leave
the solution of the Senatorial problem
a.s much In doubt, jwmi the >'mi of the
Btruggle apparently aa far off as it was
before the balloting hngsn
While it is true that both the loading
- made gains to-day, it is
equally true that both are far from
the goal, and that both have shown
nearly, if not quite, the full extent Of
their present' folio wing. Bui one thing
is dear, and that Is that r h.- fact that
i sympathy exists between the
Democrats and the bolting Republi
cans in the Baltimore city delegation.
This was dearly shown when, after
the second ballot, an attempt was made
to adjourn th.- joint convention until
to-morrow. The Democrats and bolt
ers voted solidly against th*Â» motion
and defeated it. Another fact is that
the "eleven" are seemingly stronger
than ever and are fully under the c<m
trol of th>-ir leader.
There is no doubt whatever that the
Democratic contingent stands ready to
cast its ballot for a Republican. VVho
that Republican will be is as yet un
settled, but the belief that it will be
William T. Malsu-r, Mayor of Balti
more, or M;ij..r Alexander Shaw, is
growlnsj, and the McCotnas men no
longer attempt to disguise the fact that
they dread Buch an outcome. As to
when the coalition will take place is un
certain. The Democrats have two
points to gain by protracting the strug
gle, for the longer this fight is on the
more I* disrupts the Republican party,
and they have not entirely abandoned
Die hope of protracting it through the
session, thereby making it possible that
Mr. Gorman's successor will have m be
chosen by the Legislature, which meets
in January. I*oo.
There are rumors to-night that thrÂ»
Democrats have apreed to vote f. .r
Maistt-r, providing ho wm guarantee
the necessary fifteen Republican votes
to elect.

S^Â«oht to Impose Upon a Sym

Special Dlepatrh to Th* rr a il.
NEW YoRK, Jan. 20.â Dr. J. H. Bru

Hetty Qreen, the richest woman in Amer

The new Democratic Congressional
Committee to-night elected as chair
man Senator White of California. The
election of a secretary, which had been
expected, was postponed to await ac
tion by an organization committee of
seven which will be appointed by the
new chairman.
The election has attracted a good
deal of attention in the House, owing
to its bearing on the Speakership con
test. Senator White was supported by
the friends of Representative Bailey,
who are favorable to that gentleman's
candidacy In case the next House is
Democratic. Under these circum
stances considerable confidence was
expressed in White's election, although
M<liae of Arkansas. Richardson of
Tennessee, Osborne <f Wyoming and
Myers of Indiana had been prominent
in the race. Owing to the Speakership
issue, however, the friends of Bailey
f >>lt that it was desirable that a Sena
tor should head the committee, so that
th^ chairmanship and the Speakershiit
should be entirely separated.
The meeting was q lite fully attend

of Missouri, who was defeated by Sen
ator White by the nnrrow margin of

As to the secretaryship it Is genera I
needed that Lawrence Gardner,
the Incumbent, will retire. The most
prominent candidate before the organ
ization committee is James Kerr, for
mer clerk of the House.
The committee adopted a resolution
affirming its adherence to the Chicago
platform.
The election of Senator White was
regarded as a distinct triumph for the
silver men, who Were anxious to have
a chairman whose record on the sub

SALINAS. Jan. 20.â A sad case comrs to
light In this rity of a husband deserting
his wife and baby. The wife is in desti
tute circumstances, an<l although officers
have been sending advices to different
towns they have so far been unable to

The story of the desertion Is that some
W< â¢ ks ago a man named A. Mathlesen ar

ter a little time procured work. He did
not hold his position long, and about
Christmas time went out north of town
and rented a ten-acre tract of land, upon
which he said he Intended to settle down

When he arrived in this city he told his

Castrovllle whom be. would soon bring
here. They came yesterday, but it would
seem th< y were not expected, for the hus

factory and could not be found. The wo
man told a pitiful story of desertion by
her husband and asked the services of
:;"icers to try to apprehend the man,
as she was penniless and in want.
Developments In the case reveal pome
sad features. Mrs. Mathiesen, the inlurÂ»Â»d
Wife, and her S-month-old baby came
from I'leasanton. whor- 1 she had been left
witli the promise of her husband 8008

she has been in this country not quite a
year, coming from Denmark, where her
parents are in comfortable circumstances.
Since arriving her* her parents sent her
JIOOO, which her husband spent in a short
time. He deserted her once before, about
the time of the birth or the child, but re
turned when he heard of the remittance
from home. She is now without any

MINERAL FIND NEAR CLOÂ¥ERDALE.
CLOVERDALE, Jan. 20.â A mother lode
of gold and platinum has been discovered
by George W. Coe and K. H. Whlpple,
old-time miners, four miles below Clover
dale, on the lands of W. H. Ulatt and the
Italian-Swiss Colony. The ledge contain
ing the gold Is of decayed rock, about ten
feet wide, and can bo traced distinctly
for 1000 feet. Experts estimate that the
quartz will pan out from $,"> to $15 per ton.
A Nevada County miner, who has
looked over the ground, says that the
quartz here and that taken from the rich
mines of Nevada County are very much
the same in appearance. A pan taken
from the top of the newly discovered
ledge washed out fourteen good colors. A
\on of quartz will be sent to San Fran

out as expected a company will be formed
to develop the mine..

than the highway-

health and life. And yet men actually court
the advances of this deadly enemy. -Its
name is consumption. Thousands of bright
men and women are passive victims in its
clutch. Its daily victims are numbered by
thousands.
A sure cure for this dread disease is found
in Dr. Pierce' 9 Golden Medical Discovery.
It goes directly to the seat of the trouble.
It restores vigorous action to the digestive
organs, tones up the liver, and makes the
appetite good. It makes the assimilation
perfect and supplies the blood with the
elements that build up healthy tissue. It
acts upon the lungs driving out all impuri-
ties and disease germs. It soothes the shat-
tered nerves and they resume their normal
function of imparting healthy activity to all
the organs of the body. All Druggists sell
it. Nothing else is "just as good."
" Dr. Pierce. I am one of your most gTateful
patients," writes Mrs. Annie M. Norman, of
Equinunk. Wayne Co., Pa. " I have taken
"Golden Medical Discovery." also " Favorite Pre-
scription " and ' Pellets ' with wonderful results.
I am, ns many of ray friends tell me. like the
dead brought to life. The doctors said I had
consumption and death was only a matter of
time. That was six years ago. I concluded to
try your medicine. I continued until I had taken
nine bottles of ' Discovery ' and several bottles
of " Pellets." I pot well and have done a great
deal of hard work since."
What more need be said of a book after
the one statement : "680,000 copies sold at

DEBATES IN CONGRESS
ISSUE OF
VERACITY
IS RAISED
Speaker Reed and
Leader Bailey
Clash.
Exciting Episode in the
House, but the Chair
Is Sustained.
Democrats Continue the Talk
to Recognize Cuban
Belligerency.
CHAMP; CLARK'S APPEAL
Arraigns the Administration, but Fails
to Amend the Consular Appro
priation Bill.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Jan. 20.
Speaker Reed, from the rostrum ot
the House, and Bailey, leader of the '
Democrats, from his place on the floor, â 
glared at each other at the close of the i
Cuban debate to-day and joined in an !
Issue of veracity. This sensational ep- I
lsode completely overshadowed the in- I
terest in the Cuban debate, which has !
continued uninterruptedly in the House
for three days, during the consideration
of the diplomatic and consular appro
priation bill. Yesterday notice was
given by "Williams (D.) of Mississippi
that at the conclusion of the debate to- j
day a motion would be made to re
commit the bill with instructions. To
day, when the motion was made by
Bailey, it was ruled out of order by the
Speaker. Baker thereupon startled the
House by affirming that he had a pri- i
vate understanding with the Speaker
by which a vote should be taken di- '
rectly on the motion to recommit. This ;
the Speaker emphatically denied, and
these two leaders of the respective par
ties in thediouse, with white faces and
voices shaken by emotion, set their
statements against each other s, while
the galleries looked on in breathless
amazement, and the members were in
an uproar. Smith of Michigan, who
said he was present, corroborated the
Speaker's side of the controversy. The
result of the Speaker's position was
that an appeal was taken from his de
cision and by a strict party vote it was
laid on the table, 165â 114, the Demo
crats and Populists, as on the two
previous days, voting against the solid
Republican strength. The debate was
not as Interesting as on the two pre
ceding days. The features were a
characteristic speech by Champ Clark
of Missouri, a strong appeal for con
servatism from Johnson (R.) of Indi
ana, a presentation of his observations
In Cuba during his recent trip to the
island from King 'D.) of Utah, and an
hour' 3 speech by Dingley of Maine, in
explanation of the causes of the re
duction of the wages in the New Eng
land cotton industry.
Clark (D.) of Missouri opened the de
bate with one of his characteristic breezy
speeches He said in part: "If Spain
does not bring the war to a speedy con
clusion the Inited States ought to expel
her from tho Western Hemisphere. There
?*",,Â£? no doubt as to what has been our
traditional foreign policy. What our for
eign policy is under the McKinley ad
ministration, like the peace of <Jod it
paaseth all understanding.
"In these days of McHannaism our for
eign policy is so feeble, so cringing so
cowardly that even old and decrepit
Spain insults our flag-, maltreats our citi
zens and searches our ships with perfect
Impunity, and President McKinlev In
stead of Bending men-of-war to protect
â¦ Ur u no .K Cr> . as ? crt our supremacy and
teach the insolent and impotent dons a
lesson they would not forget, has
passed the hat around and invites the
American people to contribute alms for
starving and dying Cubans.
*> " Jt i, i fÂ« hl Sh time we served plain and
emphatic notice on all kings, emperors
and other potentates that the navies of
trans-Atlantic powers shall not be used
as collection bureaus for questionable
debts, as was done a year or two ago at
Corinto, and as was done a month or two
ago at Hayti. The Cuban case is this-
For three years the insurgents have
fought with a courage and suffered with
a fortitude that have challenged the ad
miration of all the worldâ save and ex
cept the McKinley administration Three
or four hundred thousand people have
died; men, women and children, as much
martyrs in the cause of liberty as was
Warren or any other hero who died that
â we might be freed, and yet the McKinley
administration lifts not its finger to stay
the slaughter, and can think of nothink
more effective for their benefit than to
pose as the big beggarman. The party
of Sumner. Chase and Seward, which
proudly vaunted itself as the friend of
man, has become the ally of the pestilence
and arson, famine, devastation, rape and
murder.
"To every suggestion that we should
re-enter upon a vigorous foreign pollcy
we are mot with the hysterical shrlok
that we are advocating war. It is not
true; but suppose it were? There are
Borne things worse than warâ deplorable
as It unquestionably isâ and one is play-

spised of all nations and kindreds and
tongues.
"We now number over 70.000.000 souls
and a Republican administration cannot
be taunted, cuffed or kicked Into resent
ing an insult or demanding reparation for
an injury. Such a contemptible and pusil
lanimous policy is enough to make Grant
Sherman, Sheridan. Dupont. Farragu'
and Porter restless in their coffins
"My Republican friends." said the
speaker, in conclusion, "I invite you to
lay aside the weight that Ib holding you
down: assort your rights; to come out on
the side of eternal justice and human lib
erty, thereby demonstrating that you are
worthy of the high vocation to which you
are called. Democrats und Populists
stand here ready to remove from Ameri
ca her great reproach. We on this side
will contribute 152 votes. If only 27 Re
publicans will break the yoke, defy their
taskmasters and Join us in this noble
work, before the sun setn this day wÂ» will
send the glad tidings ringing round the
world that 'Cuba is free"; free, thank
God. by the act of the American Con
gress."
At the conclusion of Clark's remarks
Hitt yielded to Otgen (R.) of Wisconsin"
who called attention to the embezzlement
of thÂ° money of FraneiF Hlnton of Wis
consin, who died some years ago in Paris
by the vice-consul of the United States at
that capital and the fact that there was
no way by which the heirs of the de
ceased man could recover on the bonds of
the Consul.
Williams CD.) of Mississippi, a member
of the Foreign Affairs Committee, fol
lowed. He sneered at the statement of
Hitt yesterday that the granting of bel
ligerent rights to the Cubans would af
ford them no advantage.
"Shades of history and of all the peo
ple who have ever rebelled against tyr
anny," he exclaimed, "what a pity that
George Washington. Nathaniel Greene
and Thomas Jefferson, when seeking the
recognition of belligerency during the
(revolution did not know that belligerent
rights would not be advantageous to
them! What a pity thru Central Lee,
Jefferson Puvis and other Confederate
statesmen were not informed that bellig
erency would not aid their cause when
they were seeking that recognition
abroad:"
"Have the Cubans a government to rec
ognize?" asked Dalzell of Pennsylvania.
"They have the same sort of govern
ment that other Spanish colonies had
when they were rebelling against Spain."
"Who is their President?"
"Bartholomew Masso," interposed King
(D.) of Utah.
"Where Is the capital?" asked Dalzell.
"At Cubitas," responded Williams, as if
answering a catechism.
"At how many places was the American
capital located during the revolution?"
asked Clark (D.) of Missouri of Dalzell.
while others besieged him with ques
tions as to the name of the President of
the United States during the revolution,
etc., until Williams' time expired, when
he gave way to King (D.) of Utah, who
has recently returned from a visit to Cu
ba, and who gave the House some of the
results of his personal observations there.
Ke described the harrowing conditions
there, characterized the scheme of auton
omy as a delusion and declared that if
peace came on that basis Spain would
double the war debt on Cuba. There
would be resistance, and once more the
fires of revolution-would be kindled. Per
imancnt peace could ii"t come to the Isl
and unless independence was achieved.
King affirmed that those In Havana who
were openly committed to autonomy were
secretly helping to drag it down. In Ha
vana autonomy was derided and scorned
on every side, in conclusion, he de
clared that the dream of tiios<' who be
lieved peace could come to Cuba without
Independence would be rudely akattered.
Johnson (R.) of Indiana, in a fifteen
minute speech, sustained the course of
the administration. The President, he
said, had displayed pood sense. Bound
judgment and exalted patriotism. Con
gress, he said, would not be warranted
in attempting to override the President
and mshine the country rashly into war
fraught with tremendous consequ< i
Ho warned members that we might be
standing on the brink of a crater greater
than we Imagined. Spain might be old
and impotent and incapable of overcom
ing us. but we might goad her to that
point where, in response to her pride
and courage, she might Involve us In
great difficulties.
Simpson (P.) of K.insns. speaking for
the third party, said he was not "lying
awake o" nights worrying over the Cu
ban question." Hut he was satisfied, he
said, that the real secret behind the at
titude of the administration was the faÂ»-t
that the holders of the Spanish bonds.
$400,000,000 in amount, were !>â¢â¢! sal

said th>- bondholding Interests v. .-re as
much in control of the country as they
had been during the Cleveland adminis
tration, and that no action would h>
tak' n until the payment of these bonds
had beer, guaranteed.
After some brief pro-Cuban speeches
by Robinson (D.) of Indiana and Â«'"i-h
ran <I>. > of Missouri. Itingley <R.) of
Maine took the floor to reply to remarks
made during the course of the debate
relative to the wage reductions in the
cotton industry. After such a revulsion
of business as the country hail experi
< need during three y< ars it was natural,
he said, that rei ii;>. ration was slow. In
all but one industry (the cotton industry)
improvement was noted and wages had
been advanced. Alongside of the l 1"1" 1 per
cent reduction <".f wages in the cotton In
dustry had come an Increase greater than
that in the worsted industry. He ad
mitted, he said, that the depression in
the <-otton industry was unfortunate, but
the case was exceptional. It was due to
the sudden and unexpected decline in the
price of cotton. In three months the
price had declined 30 per cent be
the Southern planters Insisted upon
growing 2.000.000 bales more cotton than
the world wanted. Almost every cotton
â¢ in New England had from six
to eight months' supply of S cent manu
factured cotton on their hands.
In addition to this he pointed out the
effect of the competition that had grown
up in the South, where longer hours and
lower wanes were the vogue. Eventually
the South would come, up to the North
ern standard, but the temporary present
conditions gave tho South the advantage.
Protective tariffs cr>uld effect nothing if
the hours of labor in the several States
were not equalised. Dingley declared
that the labor organisations would
pel an amendment to th<> constitution
which woul>l permit Congress to equalize
hours all over the country. I Hurley had
a good deal of cross-firing with Southern
members. The <*Ã¼bnn question was tem
porarily lost sight "f. and for more than
an hour tariff was talked to the exclusion
of e\-erything else. Dingley said those
who were still "chattering" about the
lack of revenues under the new tariff
law had better be- prompt about it.
"For your opportunity to chatter will
poon be over," said he. "Yesterday our
receipts from customs were {860,000. The.
receipts themselves will soon silence these
critics."
At 4 o'clock the committee rose, under
the arrangement made yesterday, and rÂ«
ported the bill to the House. One of tho
most dramatic and sensational episodes
<>f this Congress followed. The Speaker
of the House and Bailey of Texas, the
Democratic leader, clashed <>n a question
of veracity and the excitement was in
tense. The Texan moved to recommit the
bill, with instructions to the committee to
report it back with an amendment em
bodying the terms of the Senate Cuban
belligerency resolution.
Hitt immediat<-ly made the point of or
der that the amendment was not ger
mane and was obnoxious to the rule
aginst new legislation.
This point the Speaker promptly sus
tained.
Bail* y. surrounded by a group of Demo
crats, protested that the agreement yes
terday included provision for a vote on
the motion to recommit.
Hitt denied this, saying that the notice
of the motion to recommit was given af
terward. There was much confusion
while Hitt was talking, and when he con
cluded Bailey suddenly electrified the
House with the statement that he had
had a distinct understanding to that ef
fect with the Speaker of the House.
"The chair states that the gentleman
from Texas is mistaken," retorted the
Speaker from the chair in the most em
phatic tones. The Speaker looked the
Texan straight in the eye and his voice
quivered with emotion. "The chair nevr
agreed that a motion which was plainly
out of order would be entertained^ The
gentleman notified me that there would
be no further opposition."
"And I make the statement." declared
Bailey, without flinching "that we did
have such an agreement. He, too, was
evidently laboring under great stress of
feeling.
By this time the House was in an up
roar and the spectators In the galleries
were looking on with amusement.
Bailey proceeded to explain the circum
stances under which the alleged agree
ment was made. He said that some of
the members on his side desired to attend
the funeral of a distinguished ex-member
Ben Butterworth, yesterday afternoon'
but they desired to remain if there were
to be any votes. He had approached the
Speaker, he said, with the proposition of
a vote on the motion to recommit. The
chair had assented, he declared, and he
had so informed his colleagues.
"I never knew until this motion was
presented." interrupted Hitt, "what the
instructions were to be."
"The chair again slates that no agree
ment was made," said the Speaker, look
ing down upon the turbulent scene before
him, "and if eorroboratlon is needed he
has just been informed by a gentleman
who was presentâ"
"I think the (hair will need eorrobora
tlon." Interposed Bailey, emphatically.
"I again present my statement against
that of the Speaker."
The confusion at this point was very
great, but the voice of Smith (R.) of
Michigan could be heard shouting above
the tumult that JÂ»c had been present and
that no agrr-emesjt had been mnd.>.
"The chair Is filling to rest the case

the Speaker, as he beat the desk with his
gavel in his attempt to restore order.
Bailey thereupon appealed from the de
cision of the chair and Dalzell moved to
lay the appeal on the table. The roll was
called amid much confusion, but party
lines were unbroken and by a vote of 168
to 114 the appeal was laid on the table.
The bill was then passedâ lsÃ to 95â and
at 4:40 p. m. the House adjourned.

ceed With Its Con
sideration.
Provides for Payment of
Bonds in Silver at the
Government's Option.
Vest Champions the Measure
Because of the Policy of Sec
retary Gage.
CENSUS BILL DISPLACED.
Now There Is a Prospect of Long
Debates on the Financial
Question.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House.
Washington. Jan. 20.
By the decisive vote of 41 to 2~> the
Senate to-day decided to proceed at
once to the consideration of the resolu
tion introduced a few days ago by Tel
ler of Colorado providing for the pay
ment of bonds of the United States In
silver at the option of the Government.
The resolution provides: "That all
bonds of the United States. Issued or
authorized to be issued, under the said
acts of Congress hereinbefore recited,
are payable, principal and interest, at
the option of the Government of the
United States, in silver dollars of the
coinage crC the United States, contain
ing 412' i grains each of standard sil
ver; and that to restore to its coinage
such silver coins as legal tender in pay
ment of said bonds, principal and Inter
est, is not in violation of the public
faith nor in derogation of the rights of
the public creditor."
Vest of Missouri, the member of the
Finance Committee who had charge of
the resolution, spoke briefly upon it,
but disclaimed any desire at this time
to thresh over old straw of financial
discussion. He believed, however, that
the time was ripe for a reiteration with
emphasis of the declaration of the
Stanley Matthews resolution, which
had been placed on the statute-be -ks
twenty years ago, particularly in view
of recent statements of the Secretary
of the Treasury, in which the President,
who had, as a member of the House,
votr>d for the original resolutions, evi
dently concurred. Vest announced his
intention to secure a final vote upon the
resolution as soon as one could be
reached, and accentuated his intention
by forcing thf* displacement of the cen
sus bill with the Teller resolution as the
unfinished business.
The day after 2 o'clock was spent in
executive session.
Mills of Texas secured the passage of a
resolution directing the Secretary of War
to make an examination of the Port Ar
thur ship canal, with a view to its exten
sion to deep water.
Gallinger of the Committee on Public
Health and National Quarantine secured
the adoption of a resolution empowering
th" committee to Investigate the di
bility of removing the quarantine station
from Ship Island to some other point in
the GÂ»ulf of Mexico.
Frye of the Commerce Committee re
ported favorably and secured the passage
â¢â f â¢ bill providing for the construction,
at a. cost n<>t exceeding 170,000, of a light
ship to bo located neai <"ape Elizabeth.
Lodge of Massachusetts moved that the
Senate go into executive session. This
v.-as antagonized by Vest of Missouri,
who called attention to the fact that he
had given notice of his intention to call
up the Teller resolution.
Hoar objected to the consideration of
the resolution, but withdrew his objection
to afford Allen opportunity to make a
statement. Allen then read a statement
directed to the President by Mrs. Roberts.
She says that she is the widow of How
ard Roberts, a Union soldier, that she
â¢was summarily discharged from the Pen
sion Office for misconduct affecting her
character. Charges were preferred
against her publicly and she claims to
have been treated cruelly and without
opportunity to vindicate her character.
Gallinger raid the presumption was that
the statement of Mrs. Roberts had !â â¢ en
properly referred and was now in the
proper place to receive consideration.
Gallinger then asked that the resolu
tion go over until to-morrow.
The chairman neld that Lodge's motion
took precedence and the ayes and noM
were demanded. The vote resulted: Ayes
27. noes 3ft.
The motion of Vest, to take up tho Tel
ler resolution, was then carried â 41 to 2o â
as follows:
Ayesâ Allen. Baron. Bate. Berry. Butler,
Cannon. Chllton. Clark. Clay, Cockrell. Faulk

Vest then spoke In support of the reso
lution, saying that he hail no d< sire at
this time to thresh over the old Straw of
financial discussion, but hoped to be able
to call the Senate's attention to Borne
reasons why the pending resolution should
be agreed to by the Senate. He said thru
twcr.ty years had passed since the
Matthews resolution was first put on the
statute books, but he believed that there
was no reason why there should be re
iteration of the resolution and the dec
larations contained therein. Vest main
tained that If the resolutions were orig
inally correct and proper they were cor
rect and proper at the present time
"They do not in any sense," sa!d Vest'
"involve either repudiation or dishonor "'
The Senator maintained that the issue
involving the consideration of the reÂ«o
lution had been thrust upon the Senate
by the administration, ami that the Sena
tors were required either to remain silent
and by their silence give tacit assent to
the recent declarations of the Secretary
of the Treasury' in favor of a gold stan
dard, those declarations being evidently
Indorsed by the President, or else to re
affirm the Stanley Matthews resolutions
which had been passed by the Senate by
a vote of^more than two to one and by
the House' by an overwhelming majority
Vest moved to lay aside the unfinished
business and to proceed with the dis
cussion of the Teller resolution. The mo
tion prevailed without discussion, the ef
fect being to make the resolution the un
finished business.
Vest then yielded to a suggestion of Al
drich that further consideration of the
resolution be postponed until to-morrow
In order that those opposing it might
have opportunity to prepare for the de
bate. At 2:10 the Senate went into exec
utive session, and at 5:53 adjourned.
BOLD ROBBER

BANK CASHIER

Bank.

ESCAPE OF THE OUTLAW
Miikes His Way Through Croups of
Excited People, Mounts His Horse
and Rides Away,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PORTLAND. Jan. 20.â A daring at
tempt was made to hold up the cashier
and rob the Citizens' Bank, on the
northeast corner of East Washington
street and Union avenue, to-day
shortly after 3 o'clock. The attempt
would have succeeded but for the
prompt and determined resistance on
the part of A. W. Lambert, the cashier,
who drove the robber from the bank
and took a parting shot at him as he
passed from the bar.kroom into the
str.et. He missed by aiming a little
too high.
Although the bank is situated in the
heart of East Portland, where numbers
are constantly passing along the
streets during the afternoon, and Is
surrounded by business houses, the rob
ber evaded every one and effected his
escape unscathed. When he saw he
was foiled in his purpose he hastily
left the bank, hurried around the block
and mounted a horse he had tied be
forehand un the other side of the same
block.
The entrance to the bank faces the
center of the intersection of East
Washington and Union avenue by
meana Of double doors. The bank had
just closed for the day and Mr. Lam
bert had nulled down the window
shades. E. If. Sargent, a real estate
dealer, was in his office, which opens
on East Washington street, and is in
tno rear of the bank building, being
only separated from the bank room by
a. small room and two doors, one of
which was open. He had Just been
talking to a customer when he was
ai" ised by the sh"t Cashier Lambert
had taken at the retreating form of the
thus: and dashed into the bank to as
certaln the cause.
The street in front of the bank was
at the time deserted, but the report of
ihf pistol soon caused a pica- crowd to
r fnm every direction. The scene
for a time resembled that when the
Fir>t National Bank of East Portland
was hold up by Preacher J. C. Read,
about fuur years ago.
From the evidence at hand, it is
clear that the highwayman had care
fully planned his work. He was seen
at 10 o'clock in the morning to make
an examination of the rear of the
building in which the bank is located.
He was also seen by the same person
a few minutes before the attempted
robbery, surveying the ground. The
presence of his horse also forces the
conclusion that he had carefully plan
ned his escape.
During his brief stay In the bank he
dropped a pair of spectacles, his mask,
and outside the door his hat, a light
felt one. Another hat and mackintosh
which he left behind for some, reason
or other were found in the rear of the
bull ling, where he had been seen to
put them by a woman, only a few min
utes before his attempt on the bank
took place.
The would-be robber is described as
a mnn of medium height, looking rath
er like a laborer, with a sandy beard
and florid complexion. He was dress
ed fairly well, but with an evident ef
fort at style, as his pants were neatly
creased. The local police and detective
force havf done nothing with the case
so far, and probably will not.
WIND-UP OF THE
UBER INQUIRY
Rumored That the Grand Jury
Will Present Nine
Indictments.
"Witnesses Who Fail to Appear and
Are Believed to Have Left
the Country.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CABSON, New, Jan. 20.â The Grand
Jury is dosing its labors in Genoa. I^ast
night Judge Muck, for the first time since
tho meeting of the Grand Jury, remained
over night in Genoa. To-day he was
closeted with the District Attorney and
Foreman Cook for several hours. It is
said on the streets thi.s evening that nine
indictments are being made out and will
1Â»- presented, but many shake their heads
and say that the recess from to-morrow
until Monday is too long an Interval if
the Orand Jury means business.
Chris Jensen, inspected of being one of
the lynchers, was before the Jury to-day
:uni swore that he was in Carson that
night. Many witnesses were called to
day to contradict statements made by
inspected men who were before the jury
on the defensive. Charles Hyronomous
and Abe Rice saw the mob from the win
dom of the hotel opposite the Jail, hut
When before the Grand Jury said they
were unable to identify any of the per
sons in the mob. Henry Mack. Fritz
Deerraan, William Murphy and Mrs.
Whittaker were recalled to-day.
The lynchers have their agents In Ge
noa and Carson and will bring their pres
sure on the Jury between the Friday
night adjournment and the meeting on
Monday. They need six men to holu out
against action, and it is expected that
they will resort to Intimidation and bri
bery to protect themselves.
At the present writing the Indications
are in favor of indictment. The Sheriff
was sent out last night after two wit
n< *se<3, who having been summoned
failed to materialize. It is rumored that
they have left the country to avoid tea
tlfying.

VICTORIA, B. C.. Jan. 20.â The light
housekeeper at Carmanah Point has re
ported by telegraph that the beach is
strewn with wreckage, including a lot
of life belts and buoys with "Steamer
Signal" painted on them.
Another life buoy has been found
six miles from Carmanah, bearing the
name of Alice, a craft not known in
Victoria. It is quite likely that the
buoys were washed overboard during
the recent severe weather.
SEATTLE, Wash., Jan. 20.â The
steam schooner Signal lies docked at
Schwabacher's wharf in this city and
has not been wrecked as an Associated
Press dispatch indicates. A couple of
Weeks ago the Signal left Seattle with
a cargo of coal for Astoria. After dis
charging she set sail for return to this
port on Thursday of last week. After
getting to sea Captain Bendegard threw
overboard a number of old life pre
servers which had become useless.
They were labeled "Signal" and were
evidently washed ashore and picked
up, giving rise to the report that the
vessel had been wrecked.
She reached Seattle on Saturday last
and was booked to leave for Dyea and
Bkaguay January is. Delay in loading
lumber necessitated a change of date.
Captain Bendegard informed The Call
correspondent to-night that he would
likely leave to-morrow.
Arrangements have been made by
the Government with the charterers of
the Signal to transport twenty-two
men and 110 pack animals on her next
trip north to Dyea, which will be
about February 5. In order to accom
modate her passengers a house will be
built on deck and other alterations
made. The Signal carries a crew of
fifteen men and has ample freight ac
commodations.

Almost every available vessel in California has been pressed into service to carry gold-seekers ss far as possible on their way to the gold fields of the Yukon. The fleet will be made up
of ships, barks, barkentines, schooners, ocean-going steamers anJ the more modest coaster, steam launches galore, and even the handy little gasoline launch has not been overlooked. Of
stern-wheel river steamers there will be a full supply, and if the transportation companies can only get the people to St. Michael there will be no lack of facilities to convey them up the Yukon.
In order to supply all these steamers with fuel a fleet of ten large sailing vessels will carry coal from Departure Bay to Dutch Harbor.
RATES HAVE
TAKEN A JUMP
An Advance ot Twenty-
Five Per Cent on the
Skaguay Route.
Nearly Every Available Vessel
in Port Has Now Been
Chartered.
Lute News From DawÃon Shows
That Food Commands a
Big Price.
Following the example set by the
shipowners in Alaska, the Pacific Coast
Steamship Company and the Pacific
Steam Whaling Company yesterday
advanced rates between here and Alas
ka 25 per cent. Beginning yesterday
passengen had to pay $82 first class
and $41 second class from San Fran
cisco to Dyea and Skaguay, while from
Seattle to the same points the rate
will be 550 and $35. From San Fran
cisco to Orca, Copper River, Portage
Bay and Valdes Pass on Prince Wil
liams Sound the rate will be $100 first
clasp and $75 second class, while from
Seattle to the same points the rates will
be $90 and $70. The rates from San
Francisco via Portland to Dyea and
Fkaguay will be the same as from San
Francisco direct. Freight rates have
been advanced to $13 a ton and pas
s^nsrprs will now only be allowed 150
pounds of personal baggage.
The charter of sailing vessels and
steam schooners still goes merrily on.
It cannot last much longer, however.
as the supply of craft that are guar
anteed to keep afloat for a reasonable
time has almost given out. W. E.
Migholl's line of coal-carriers has all
been secured to take black diamonds
to Dutch Harbor and Unalaska.
Among them is the James Nesmith,
now on her way here from New York;
the J. B. Krfiwn, due here from Aca
pulco, from Australia: the TVilna, Car
rolton, Elwell. Wachusett, Sea King
and General Fairchild. Another of his
fleet, the Rufus E. Wood, will carry
passengers from here to St. Michael.
The Sintram, with the river steamers
of tlv North American Transportaiim
Company will be towed to St. Michael
itch Harbor by the tug Fearless
and when the steamers have been put
together will tow them to the mouth of
th" Yukon.
Among the vessels chartered for the
Dyea-Skaguay route are the Chilkat
nrid Alice Blanchard. The former will
S< attle and Juneau on her way
and die Alice Blanehard will make
Port Lob Angeles her starting point.
Th<^ steam schooner Navarro is to be
built up to carry 150 passengers, and
ph" will go into commission at once,
while parties are now negotiating for
th^- ripone. Kimball & Co.'s new
steamer Dirigo is to leave Grays Har
bor for Ban Francisco to-morrow, and
as her machinery is all ready for her at
thp Fulton Iron Works she will be
ready to go into -commission the first
week in March.
The steam schooner Protection is
ready to sail at a moment's notice, and
the Albion will get away Monday or
Tuesday. Both of them will go on the
Skaguay run, the Protection stopping
at Seattle and the Albion at Eureka
only on the way. At Eureka the Albion
will take on about twenty passengers
and considerable lumber for uf at
Dyea, The steam schooner Signal has
also been chartered and on her return
from Honolulu the schooner Anna will
also go into the passenger business.
The schooner Mary Gilbert, which was
turned into a passenger boat several
months ago, but could not secure any
passengers and was laid up in conse
quence, has been hauled out. of retire
ment and will go on the Copper River
rou I^.
The steamer St. Paul is to be ready
for the Alaska Commercial Company
in time Jo be at St. Michael whon the
river opens. Every part of her is ready,
but the work of putting her together
will not begin until after the launching
of the Japanese cruiser to-morrow. In
the meantime Leon Sloss and Captain
Nlebaum make frequent visits to the
works to see that good progress is be
ing made with the vessel.
Vessels that go to Nanaimo, B. C, for
coal are finding it hard work to get
cargoes. Since Alex Orr, the under
ground foreman of the East Wellington
mine, came back with $^0,000 in nuggets
the miners have had the gold craze,
and in consequence there is very lit
tle coal being mined out. When the
rush fairly sets in it is feared that some
of the miiifs will be deserted, and in
that event the lack of coal carriers will
not be noticed so much. All kinds of
s will rendezvous in Dawson City
this summer.
The latest and most conservative
news regarding the Klondike country
was brought to this city yesterday by
a friend of J. P. Marshall, a well
known Portland business man. Mar
shall, together with a number of bank
ers and business men, sent a party of
prospectors, headed by J. Whiting, the
old Nevada expert, to examine the
whole Alaskan gold situation. In a let
ter to a friend Marshall says:
"Whiting, our expert, has just arrived
from the seat of the excitement. He
brings accounts that vary in many
ways from those brought by others. He
left Dawson on November 23, and came
through to bring gold and get provis
ions. He came in twenty-three days
with dogs, averaging as high as sixty
miles some days. He says the river
route is a delusion and a snare."
According to the report brought by
Whiting, there are about thirty miilions
of gold, cached and ready to ship. He
thinks It will be hard to get it out of
the country. When he left the prices
of provisions ran about as follows:
Hay, $400 per ton; flour. $200 per hun
dred weight; bacon, $225 per hundred
weight; sugar $30 per hundred weight;
whisky, $40 per gallon. Wages were $10
and $20 a day.
A dispatch received last night shows
that the Klondike fever is raging at
Eureka. The Albion will stop there en
route next Tuesday, and many passen
gers will go. The dearth of steamers
has affected the shingle business and
manufacturers cannot secure means of
transporting their products.
MIXED TOBACCO.
An Appeal Has Beer) Taken prom
the Decision of thje General
Appraisers.
A circular was received from the
Treasury Department yesterday by Col
lector of the Port Jackson, requesting
the Collector not to take any offi
cial action in the matter of the duty
on tobacco in mixed bales until a
decision shall havp been rendered in the
appeal of Rothschilds & Bros, from the
ruling of the United States Board of
General Appraisers In New York. The
decision of the appraisers was to the
effort that tobacco in mixed bales con
taining various percentages of wrapper
tobacco, loss than 16 per cent of each
bale, and the remainder of filler tobacco,
is dutiable under paragraph 213 at 3 r .
rents per pound as tiller tobacco. The
two grades of tnb:icio cannot bo con
structively separated and assessed for
duty a? part wrapper and part filler, and
each bale must be classified as an en
tirety.
COLLISIONS ON
THE WATER FRONT
Steamer Point Arena Crashed
Into the Ralph J.
Long,
While the Gasoline Schooner Her
cules Went Against the
Roderick Dhu.
Several vessels met with mishaps on '
the front yesterday. The first one to pet
into trouble was the schooner Bella. She
was on her way to Tillamook. got caupht
in a squall and her foremast head car
ried away. She was towed to Main
street wharf, where the repairs will be
made.
The gasoline schooner Hercules was the
next to get Into trouble. Returning from
her trial trip Captain Turner did not slow
down quickly enough, and in consequence
the schooner crashed into the bark Rod
erick Dhu, which was leaving for Hono
lulu. The bark was not damaged much,
but the Hercules lost her jibboom.
The steam schooner Point Arena, while
docking at section A of the seawall, was
caught by the tide, which runs like a
millrace at that point, and was carried
down on the schooner Ralph J. Long,
which was at the same section elischarK
ing lumber. The Long's forward bits
were torn out and her stern was
considerably damaged, while the Point
Arena was hardly scratched. A good
deal of repairing will have to be done to '
the schooner before she can put to sea
again.
Large shipments of cotton for Japan
have gradually accumulated on the
hands of the Pacific Mail Company, so
the Aztec had to be put on as a special
boat t>> carry it to Kobe. She went oat
yesterday with a cargo valued at 1299,997.
The State Mining Bureau has rented
the north end of the mezzanine floor of
the new ferry depot from the Harbor
Commissioners at JlChj per month. W. W.
Montague's offer to put radiators in the
depot for the sum of 52'<27 was accepted !
by the Commissioners yesterday.
Steve Pagett:. a Chinatown loafer, was
taken to the Harbor Receiving Hospital
yesterday Buffering from strychnine pois
oning. He said ?i Chinese had admlnis- i
t^red it to him on a biscuit, but Detec- '
tlve Gibson, who looked Into the matter, \
came to the conclusion that there was
no truth in the story. Pagetti is a mor
phine fiend.
Nonsuit Granted.
A nonsuit was granted by Judge Hunt
in thr action of Gollfried Schink against
the Pacific Rolling Mills yesterday.
Schink. who was Injured in the rolling
mills sjmo time ago, was suing for 125,600
damages. He alleged ihat his Injuries
resnlt<*d from the company's negliKt-n.-e
in allowing an Inexiie-rknced boy to run
a stpr.m hammer. S< hink was unable t<>
prove that t'io boy who was running the
>iamn:er at *he time he was injured wss
inexperienced, and in consequence lost
his st'it.
A NOVELTY IN SPORTS.
Basket-Bail at Night Between Young Men's Christian Association
Teams.
The first game of the Young Men's Christian Association Basket Ball League for the season of IS9B was played
in the gymnasium of the local association last evening, the contesting teams being the Business Men of San Fran
cisco and the Incognitos of Oakland, the former winning by a score of 29 to 9. There was a good sized crowd pres
ent to witnesr, the game, aJnong the spectators being a number of ladies, who grew most enthusiastic over the
clever plays that followed In rapid succession.
The San Franclscos clearly outclassed the men from across the bay, their play being more rapid and their
placing more accurate than the others. They worked together, too, as a team better than the visitors did, show-
Ing the beneficial results of steady practice.
The honors of the game fell to Titus of the San Franciscos, whose work was a revelation to those who had
never seen him bc-foie. He was ably supported, however, by all the other members of the team, but it must be said
that they ha,d a decided advantage in being accustomed to the room. Some of the gymnasium paraphernalia that
could not be removed interfered greatly with the Oakland players, who would attempt to pass the bail to another
player, only to have it strike a guy rope and bound back Into the ready hands of an opponent.
The Oaklands were also unfortunate In the matter of fouls, their opponents scoring many points from their
frequent infraction of the rules.
From the moment the umpire's whistle sounded for the first half, and the ball was tossed in the air, the San
Franciscos scored an advantage, and In less than three minutes had placed the first point to their credit. From
that time on the game was never in doubt, although the Oaklands mada a stubborn fight to the end. At the call
of time the locals had scored 14 to 3 for the visitors. In the second half, Batzer was substituted for Bernhard, but
otherwise both teams played the same men throughout, the line-up being. as follows:
Business Men. Position. Incognitos. *â¦,
Goodrich Left field Lausten.
Titus Right field Hunter.
Wilson Center Lackin.
Auger : Left guard Dunsmore.
Bernhard Right guard .' Brown.
Next Thursday evening the Lawyers of San Francisco will play the Athens of Oakland at the same place.
THE SAN FKAXCISCO CALL, FHIDAY, JANUARY 21, 1898.
HAS LOTS OF
MONEY TO BURN
F. T. Bohen, a Wealthy
Miner of Montana, a
"Good Thing."
He Refuses to Give Virgie Mel
rose Back Her Rare
Diamonds.
Judge Conlan Issues a Search War
rant and the Case Will Be Heard
This Morning.
F. T. Bohen, a wealthy mining man
from Montana, seems to be a "good
thing" to a number of people and he
is being pushed along for all he is
worth.
One of his beneficiaries Is Virgie Vcl
rose, a young woman well known In
the "tenderloin district," but the
course (jf their friendship has not !>â¢â¢â¢ v
running smooth since Wednesday night
and yesterday afternoon Yirgie ob
tained a search warrant from Judge
Conlan to recover the possession of a
pair of diamond earrings from Bohen
and Henry Dosoher, proprietor of the
Seal Rock House at the Ocean Beach.
In telling her story to the Judge she
said: "I met Bohen a few days ago
and he told me he intended to go to
the Seal Rock House to spend a few
days. After he went there he induced
me to put up there also as he felt lone
ly and wanted company.
"I was feeling blue one day and he
asked me what was the matter with
me. I told him I wanted $130 and he
said that needn't bother me. He gave
me the money and I got my diamond
earrings with it which I had given as
security for a loan of $130. Last night
I was cleaning the earrings in alcohol
and Bohen took them and admired
them. When I asked him to return
them he said he would keep them and
handed them over to Doscher. I tried
persuasion and then threats, but they
laughed at me. and finally I drove into
the city and asked the help of the po
lice, but they would do nothing as Dos
cher telephoned to them that he had
the diamonds.
"The diamonds are worth $570; at
least that is what ex-President Baril
las of Guatemala, who presented them
to mp, paid for them. He bought them
for me while he was in the city on a
visit.
"Bohen has be<*n having a goM
time out at the Seal Rock House and
has been spending his money lik" a
prince, but T don't propose that he
should be allowed to keep my dia
monds pven though he advanced me the
loan of $130."
A polier-man was sent out to the Pr>al
Rock House with the search warrant
and the case will be heard by Judge
Conlan this morning.
O. M. Welburn, the ex-Collector of
InU-rnal Revenue, was a friend of the
Melroee woman, and it was said that
he wasted considerable money upon
h^r. She is a handsome brunette and
belongs to a respectable family in the
city.
THE LOUD BILL.
Postoffice Department In Favor
of Its Passage for Ecooomy
and Justice.
D. 8. Richardson, secretary of the
Postoffice in this city, has collated some
interesting figures bearing upon the
merits of Congressman Ix>ud's bill ex
cluding certain classes of mail matter
from the second class category.
During the year 15.% there were mailed
at the San Francisco iv.stoflice r.,434.123
pounds of second-class mail matter. I lur
ing lkf'7 5,3fi".i77 pounds were mailed. The
)M,st;iuo paid <>n this was at the rate of
1 cent per pound, the Government receiv
ing for UN 554.X41 29; for isii", $T>S,!<7l 77.
The cost to the Oovp rntnent for the
transportation of this matter was at the
L rate of 8 cents per pound, leaving an
enormous d(fWieney.
i Mr. Richardson says that if the yellow
covered novels that are sent as second
class matter could be eliminated and
placed in the third class with standard
works paying the Government 8 cents per
pound portage, together with papers and
advertisements of private Interests, there
would be no deficiency whatever, and
there wÂ«.'ild be no occasion for the sug
gestion that the carrier service should be
cut down.
SUDDEN DEATH.
The Colored plag Bearer of Lincoln
Post a Victim of Heart
Disease.
George H. Roberts, the colored flag
bearer <>f Lincoln Post, Grand Army of
the Bepublic, died suddenly yesterday
while being conveyed in an ambulance
from his home to the City Receiving
Hospital.
Three ;lays ago the deceased moved
into the basement of 302 Van Ness
avenue, having rented the premises from
litea M E. Peyton, who occupies the
upper floors. Shortly before 9 o'clock
.-â¢lay morning Roberts was found
lying on the 800 l <>f his room in an un
loufl condition. The City Receiving
Hospital ambulance was telephoned for,
but the unfortunate man .lied before the
vehicle reaihed its destination. The body
was taken t>> tin Morgue, whore an ex
amination convinced Surgeon Gallagher
that death had been caused by disease of
the heart.
When the people in charge of the ara
bulance attempted to remove Roberts'
body from the hnise they were resisted
by a iargt Newfoundland dog owned by
the deceased. W. chili's, who worked
with Roberts for the Studebaker Bros."

A GIRL WHO
ACTED NOBLY
Sharon Case Recalled by the
Marriage of One of the
Witnesses.
Gave Evidence In Favor of Sarah
Althea, but Subsequently
Retracted.
A wedding was ,:elebmte<S at th* Metho
dist parsonage in AluoÂ«<ia 33 January 12,
the officiating clergyman being the Rev.
Mr. Bovard. The contracting parties
were Robert Becching, secretary of the
San Francisco Benevolent Association,
and Miss Nellie Brackett of this city. It
was a very quiet affair, on account of the
death of the groom's mother, which oo
curred a few days before the ceremony.
It is many years since Miss Nellie
Brarkctt (now Mrs. Beeehing) has been
in the public mind, but she will be re
memberi il as having been one of the
most important witnesses in the famous
Bharon â¢mm sumo twelve years ago, in
which Sarah Althea Hill tried to estab
lish her right to be railed the wife of the
deceased millionaire and so inherit one
half of his vast fortune. It created a
â Teat sensation at that time, but now has
been almost entirely forgotten.
During the progress of the trial Miss
Nellie I-iraekett gave the strongest kind
of testimony in favor of the plaintiff, and
her evidence would no doubt have done
much t'> establish the rights of Sarah
Althea had not something unforeseen hap
pened. This was nothing less than an
affidavit, made by Miss Brackett, in
which she solemnly swore that her evi
dence in the case was mere fabrication,
ami she retracted everything to which she
had testified.
(ioneral Barnes, who was one of the
attorneys for the defendant, became
reminiscent yesterday when discussing
the Incident and said: "If that is the
same Miss Brackett, who was a witness
in the Sharon case, she was but a young
girl at that time not more than 14 or 1j
years of age. -^nd she was more sinned
against than s.ni.ing. It was an example
of what wo wotlld now call hypnotic in
fluence, exerted by Sarah Althta. By a
system of cajoling, threats, gift making
and promises for the future the older
woman had obtained a complete mastery
over the child and compelled her to swear
falsely in regard to occurrences which
had no foundation in fact. The girl, bOW
ever, acted nobly and made full repara
tion by going on the witness-stand and
making an affidavit completely denying
her first evidence. She made the amende
honorable and was not to blame for her
conduct, for she was a mere child In
years and experience and was simply a
tool in the hands of an older and design
ing woman."
TROUBLE OVER
"DOCTOR" FINE
Appointed Interne of the
City and County
Hospital.
Not Being a Graduated Physi
cian He Has No Right to
the Position.
Protest of the Doctors Who Recently
Received Their Diplomas
at Cooper's.
The recently graduated physicians
from Cooper Medical College are ob
jecting to the appointment of a young
medical student at the City and County
Hospital who has no diploma and who
was never graduated at any college of
medicine.
The young man in question appears
on the bulletin boards of the hospital
as Dr. Fine, and is assigned to wards
H and D. both being medical wards.
His opponents say that he has failed
at two examinations and has never
once come near the standard, and that
his appointment is in direct violation
of the rules of the Board of Health re
garding the appointment of internes
that reads as follows:
Rules regarding house physicians and
Burgeons. Section 1. There shall be ap
pointed by the Board of Health annually
a staff of house physicians and surgeons
(Internes) who shall oÂ« recently gradu
ated in medicine and recommended by
th.ir respective faculties. They shall be
appointed for one year's term of service
and shall reside In the hospital in apart
ments designated by the superintendent
and shall be allowed their board and
washing, but shall be allowed no fees.
The young man in question was a
student at the San Francisco Poly
clinic, a % department of the University
of California, and from this college
there have been no graduates since
last July and the rules of the Board
of Health calls for men recently grad
uated from college. It is known that
he did not graduate at this time nor
did he graduate the year before, and ac
cordingly he has no rights to the privi
leges of the City and County Hospital.
Dr. Supsdorf denies any responsibil
ity in the affair. He says: "If any
body is to blame it is the faculty of the
college. I have nothing to say regard
ing who will be internes, though I have
other power. The faculty of the col
lege recommends the internes and we
accept them."
He then stated that Dr. Fine was
only placed in there temporarily. The
young graduates say that he has no
right to be there temporarily, and that
he has no right even to the title doc
tor.
Dr. Sussdorf first claimed that it did
not make any difference whether the
internes had any diploma or not as
long as they passed the examination
and were recommended by the faculty,
but when shown his opinion differed
from that of the rules he made the for

BOREL BALL
FOR DEBUTANTES
Elaborate Entertainment at
Native Sons' Hall Last
Evening.
The Four Hundred Dances In Honor
of the Miase3
Borel.
Quite the most elaborate private enter
tainment of the season was the ball given
last evening by Mr. and Mrs. Antolne Bo
rel complimentary to their debutante
daughters, the Misses Grace and Alice
Borel
Native Sons' Hall never looked prettier
than it did last night with Its tasteful ar
rangement of paims and bunting, all in
dainty lavender and white tones.
Everything 1 possible was done for the j
comfort of the 400 guests and the accom- |
modations were as perfect as though the j
affair was being held in a private, well- I
appointed home.
It was close to 10 o'clock when the !
guests began to arrive. Dancing was at
once inaugurated and continued until
midnight, when an elaborate supper was
served. After supper dancing was once
anain in order.
Mr. and Mrs. Borel received their
guests, assisted by their daughters, the
Misses Nita, Sophie, Grace and Alice
Borel. All the ladles of the receiving
party were gowned in white. Mrs. Borel
wore an elegant white brocaded satin,
trimmed with lavender velvet ribbon and
bands of gold embroidery. Miss Sophie
Borel wore a brocaded satin gown, the
corsage of which was entirely covered
with lace. Miss Nita Borel was hand
j somely gowned in white duchesse satin.
i trimmed with costly lace, and the Misses
Grace and Alice Borel were attired alike
In white tulle over white satin.
The invited guests were Mr. and Mrs.

THE REfJDY WARRANT.
IT is not surprising that the professors at Stanford
should be torn by emotion over the arrest of
one of their number. The man arrested was of
course innocent, otherwise the bucolic constable
would never have made him prisoner. Yet it is ap
parent that the objecting professors base their in
dignation on this fact. Certainly it is better that a
warrant should have been served upon an innocent
professor than upon a guilty one. Had the accused
been the "John Doe" for whom the constable was
looking Stanford would have felt itself swept
by a flush of shame from which it, happily, is now
free.
If Professor Dudley, by the mere inconvenience of
being kept a short time in jail, shall awaken the pub
lic to the fact that there is too great a tendency to
arrest citizens who happen to wander into the vicinity
of a constable, he should not begrudge the time nor
the discomfort. To be near a constable is not neces
sarily a crime. An indiscretion it may be, but so long
as constables do not carry signs the most worthy
professors are apt to drift into this form of error.
What the average constable needs is common sense.
But having acquired this lie would immediately re
sign, so the path to a better state of things is dark
and devious.
But we contend that a professor has a right to go
nosing after specimens of flora and to wear his oldest
clothes while doing it and not be thrown in jail be
cause he fails to answer the fool questions of a con
stable who is snooping around for a chance to try a
"John Doe" warrant on somebody. In this we are
confident of having the support of President Jordan
and every member of his distinguished staff.
FARMERS OGOINST fINNEXfITION.
IT is time for the American farmer to have his in
nings in politics. In a normal year our farm lands
produce a surplus of the bread and feed grains, far
beyond domestic consumption. This surplus must go
abroad for a market and must sell at the world's price
in competition with the land and labor of all other
countries of competitive production. In this situation,
if we are large consumers of a product of the soil,
which we must import but which we can raise at
home under proper encouragement, it is the height
of folly not to turn our lands and labor to that pur
pose. We consume sugar to the amount of more
than $100,000,000 annually in excess of our produc
tion. The most of this is beet sugar. In 1884 the
world produced of cane sugar 2,180,000 and of beet
sugar 2,690,000 long tons. In 1894 the production was
cane sugar 3,080,000 and beet sugar 4,790,000 long
tons.
Production and consumption increase about 7 per
cent a year.
It Is demonstrated that our farm lands can produce
in beet sugar our entire consumption. Withdrawing
them from production of the bread and feed grains
and putting them into sugar beets will reduce our
surplus of the former with a favorable effect on the
price they will bring at home and abroad.
Our farmers will gain not only this enhanced price,
but will keep at home the $100,000,000 now spent
abroad for sugar. This will also add a valuable crop
to their present list of production and gain in pos
sibility of rotation of crops so necessary to the sus
tained fertility of the soil.
There are 10.000.000 American farmers and 30,000.
000 of our citizens directly dependent upon agricul
ture for a living and a competence.
The American farmer is no longer a peasant. He
is a producer and a merchant. He knows the effect
upon his industry and his interests of far climates, of
distant competing fields, of domestic and international
politics. He knows, too, the advantage of his posi
tion in this republic and proposes to get a share of
the profits that generate under our system of laws. He
is opposed to the extension of that system to any
distant country and the dilution of his advantages by
bestowing them on others.
It is for these reasons that the American farmer
opposes the annexation of Hawaii, with a large debt
to be paid out of his substance and a prospective tax
of hundreds of millions to fortify the islands and
build navies to control and defend them. The Ameri
can continental policy of the republic is good enough
for the American farmer and he wants no change.
The wife of an actor has just secured a divorce
which permits her to marry again, but denies to the
ex-husbnnd a similar boon. Such decrees are prob
ably made to show the court's state of mind, and as
matters of law may possess great excellence. As a
matter of fact, however, men are either married or
they are not. and they will take this view just as soon
as occasion may arise.
Only a decent respect for the feeling and reputation
of the swine checks a natural impulse to say that the
Hanford man who ate sixty-two -jems at a sitting is
a hog.
WARNING OF TH|E LOS ONGELES CASE.
T"HE unpopularity of corporations in this coun
try is due to their own conduct, or at least to the
conduct of some of them. In the nature of things
there is no reason why the business of a corporation
should be done differently from that of an individual.
Corporations and partnerships and individuals use
capital for profit in enterprises. In each case con
tracts are made and there is buying and selling.
The ethics of these transactions do not change with
the parties to them.
The unpopularity of corporations has arisen in the
disposition of some to violate contracts, rue bargains
and seek advantages which are not theirs honestly.
These acts are most frequently done in corpora
tion contracts with public officers, the representatives
of the people in their political government. Muni
cipal Councils, Boards of Supervisors, State Legis
latures and the Federal Congress have been the legal
bodies most frequently manipulated for improper ad
vantage by corporations. If these bodies had always
been composed of a majority of wise and upright
men, insusceptible of such approach, scandal would
not have been made and corporations would have
been kept in the line of right conduct and their pres
ent bad repute would never have existed. There is no
doubt that members of such legislative bodies have
learned more than to give to corporations that which
they ought not to have. They have learned that
there is profit in threatening to take from them what
is theirs by law and right. So we have the legislative
"cinch" that is loosened by bribery. Corporations
having got what does not belong to them find them
selves able to retain what does only by the payment
of money to corrupt public officers. In this way the
"parliamentary expenses" of many large corporations
have become a burden and legislative blackmail has
taken a high place among the black arts of politics.
The issue over the water works of Los Angeles is
a sample of the methods by which corporations win
deserved unpopularity and popular government is
brought into contempt.
In this case there is a plainly stated contract, under
which public property was leased for thirty years to
a private corporation. By an expansion in population
unforeseen by either party to the contract, it has
proved of immense profit to the private corporation.
It is about to expire, and its plain recital of what is
to be done then leaves no room for any reasonable
disagreement. It is the duty of the city government
to proceed faithfully and in line with the public in
terest, to arbitrate and ascertain the value of the bet
terments put upon its property by the private cor
poration and acquire the same in the way pointed
out by the contract. If this were done the members
of the private corporation would surrender the public
property they have so profitably used under a lease
hold and would retire with fortunes that none would
grudge them. The city officers would get that popular
approval deserved by men who do their duty. The
communistic movement against all property would
get a check and the sum of corporate unpopularity
would not be increased.
If such sharp and dishonest practices as are illus
trated by this Los Angeles incident are continued un
til public desperation leads to an irresistible attack
upon property rights in which guilty and innocent
suffer in a common wreck, in the final analysis the
blame will rest upon those who refused to be con
tent with fair gains and with fair play.
THJE IMMIGRATION LEAGUE.
SENATOR LODGE'S immigration restriction
bill has safely passed the Senate, but according
to a number of our Eastern exchanges it will
meet with strong opposition in the House. A power
ful combination is working to defeat it, and it is prob
able a long fight as well as a hard one may be re
quired to overcome an opposition so forceful and so
determined.
The strength of the opposition, so far as is made
public, seems to be centered in an association known
as the "Immigration Protection League," which has
its headquarters in New York. Bourke Cockran is
president of the league and the membership contains
many persons hardly less eminent in politics and so
ciety. This league proposes at an early day to hold
a mass meeting to protest against the Lodge bill in
the hope that the protest will be effective in restrain
ing action in the House.
The league is not made up wholly of naturalized
foreigners, as the fact that Bourke Cockran is presi
dent of it might lead one to suppose. On the con
trary, it contains many native born Americans whose
view of the proposed restriction may be inferred from
a recent letter of William Lloyd Garrison denouncing
what he called "the inhuman, un-American policy of
excluding emigrants."
There is nothing in the Lodge bill to justify ex
citement on the part of the league or the screaming
indignation of Mr. Garrison. The measure is cer
tainly neither inhuman nor un-American. On the con
trary it is in the interests of humanity and the wel
fare of Americans. The object is not to exclude im
migrants as such, but persons who are unfitted to as
similate with American society or appreciate the ad
vantages of our political system.
It appears that the leaders of the league are mis
representing the scope of the bill in order to cause
prejudice against it and to arouse antagonism to it
As a matter of fact the bill will hardly exclude any
immigrant from Northern or Western Europe. It
has been frequently pointed out by the friends of the
proposed measure that immigrants from Switzerland,
Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Germany, France, Great
Britain, Ireland and Finland have an average illiter
acy of only a,Vi to every 100. Very few people of
these countries therefore will be excluded.
Back of the Immigration Protection League stand
the managers of foreign steamship companies, and a
considerable number of mine owners who wish to
procure cheap labor for their mines. There is busi
ness as well as sentiment in the opposition, and the
one is about as bad as the other. Mr. Garrison would
have done well to consider the company he is in and
the stake the American workingman has in the issue
before he indulged the florid rhetoric of denouncing
the restriction policy as "inhuman and un-American."
The health officer has been instructed to examine a
certain cigar factory and report as to its sanitary con
dition. Ashe Jcnows in advance that of two persons
engaged there in making cigars one is a consumptive
and the other a victim of cancer, it may be hoped that
he will not find the sanitation so perfect as to induce
him to regard the factory useful as a promoter of
health.
The collective ear of the country vainly endeav
ors to note any sound of protest provoked by
Blanco's threat to resign. There is nothing slangy
in remarking that he is welcome tv resign and be
hanged.
Perhaps some grocery store eggs are not up to the
standard, but a woman who stole a dozen and se
creted them in the bosom of her dress hatched out
a thirty day sentence readily enough.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 21, IS9B.
THE KLONDIKE TKfIDE.
SAN FRAJs'CISCO has the Klondike trade.
Whether she captured it by energy or whether
it came to her by natural attraction matters not.
It is hers. All declarations to the contrary on the
part of noisy opponents and all doleful croakings on
the part of timid residents are refuted by the records
of the water front. The tram : which already has come
to San Francisco is pressing upon the limit of trans
portation facilities, and the rush has just begun.
It may now be accepted as a settled fact that all
who wish to go to Alaska by any sure and safe
transportation line will be virtually obliged to come to
San Francisco to arrange for the trip. It is from this
port all the great steamers and sailing vessels start
for the north, and persons who go to any of the way
ports and wait for a steamer to come along and pick
them up will have their waiting for their pains.
Ship-owners are not the only business men of the
city who are feeling the impulse of the Alaskan trade.
The ship-builders have orders for new vessels that
strain the capacity of their plants to build. In every
one of them there is ceaseless activity. A whole fleet
of new vessels will be added to the commercial marine
of the city by the tfme the melting of the ice opens
a way to St. Michael and the Yukon River. These,
of course, will increase the transportation facilities
from this port, but even when all are launched it is
doubtful if they will be able to carry any freight other
than that which is shipped by our own merchants or
by Alaskan parties starting from here.
As a matter of fact the Klondike rush has become
too great to be adequately dealt with by any city of
le?s size than the metropolis of the coast. When
thousands of men are to be outfitted for at least a
year in a climate like that of Alaska there are
needed to meet the demand large stores and stocks
of supplies and large equipments for traffic and trans
portation. This fact is well understood by those who
are preparing to go to the northern gold fields, and
as a consequence they are coming here to get their
outfits, provisions and mining implements.
The Mining Fair will add force to tlie attractions
which are already drawing the great mass of Klon
dike prospectors to the city. It will offer strong in
ducements to all who contemplate entering upon
mining enterprises in any field whatever, and particu
larly so to those who intend to venture into the
gold fields of the Yukon. Under any circumstances
such an exhibition would be of beneilt to the com
munity and to the mining industry, but this comes
so opportune to the demands of the time and the
place that the good to be expected from it can be
hardly overrated.
Whatever may have been the shortcomings of San
Francisco in other things, it has certainly shown com
mendable vigor in preparing to profit by the oppor
tunity of the new gold excitement. It has prepared
for a big trade, has laid in ample supplies for the
traffic, provided inrreased transportation facilities and
opened an exposition to instruct the public in the in
dustry. It has taken energy to accomplish these
things, and it is gratifying to know that there is
every prospect the energy will be abundantly re
warded.
THE WATER FRONT MARKET.
O CCORDIXG to statements made at a meeting
/ \ of the Board of Harbor Commissioners on
Tuesday by members of the Fanners' Club, the
opposition to' the establishment of a free public mar
ket upon the water front proceeds from the commis
sion merchants and the river transportation compa
nies whose revenues will be impaired by the enter
prise. The commission merchants do not want to be
"regulated" by the Harbor Commissioners, and the
river transportation companies engaged in conveying
pioduce to this city are disposed to resent any inter
ference with their business.
From the standpoint of these interests there is, of
course, nothing improper in the positions they have
taken. But it is not readily perceivable what differ
ence it should make to the Harbor Commissioners
whether the produce merchants and river transporta
tion companies oppose the free market or not. The
act of March 29, 1897, which authorizes the board to
establish the market, says nothing about either of
those interests. It merely orders the commission
peremptorily to set apart a siriicient number of, piers
to accommodate all the producers of perishable food
products in the State and to connect them with the
belt line railroad. The act says "shall," not "may."
It is therefore mandatory, not permissive.
Moreover, it will be difficult for any person whose
mental vision is not obscured by prejudices to under
stand why the interests of the commission merchants
and river transportation companies should be allowed
to block an enterprise which has been conceived for
the benefit of every man, woman and child in San
Francisco. There are not over 500 men engaged in
handling perishable products in this city, and not
more than three or four river transportation compa
nies. On the other hand, there are upward of 300,000
men. women and children interested in the free
market.
Cheap food is the great necessity of the modern
world. Schemes for producing and distributing it are
the problems of civilization. No people can be pros
perous and happy unless they have sufficient to eat,
and the cheaper food products become the easier it
is for everybody to attain the chief end of existence,
which is physical comfort. The free market author
ized by the late Legislature is a distinct advance in
civilization. By bringing producers and consumers
together that market will eliminate to a large extent
the services of the middlemen, thereby cheapening the
food supply of the city. This may be hard on the
merchants now engaged in handling produce. But
the introduction of railroads was hard on teamsters
and hackmen. and the invention of street cars was
exceedingly distasteful to the owners of omnibuses
and other conveyances.
If the produce dealers cannot turn the free market
to account they will simply be compelled to accept the
inevitable and charge their destruction over to the
immutable laws of progress. The Harbor Commis
sioners have no discretion in the matter. They "must"
establish a free market. It is vain for the opposing
Interests to await the assembling of the Legislature.
That body will never repeal the law.
English authorities have reached to San Francisco
and nabbed a doctor charged with an offense which
resulted in the death of a young woman. The pris
oner knows that if his guilt be demonstrated he will
be hanged. Now suppose his crime had occurred in
California? Perhaps for reply it will be well to
await the verdict in a similar case now on trial here,
the position of defendant not being a new one to the
accused. But it is safe to predict that the local pris
oner will miss being hanged, and by such a wide mar
gin that he can soon resume business at the old stand.
Perhaps the Los Angeles Water Company swell*
the total of its assets by including a job lot of daily
papers. The contract with the city, however, does
not bind the taxpayer to purchase any of this sort of
truck in buying the corporation plant

TJIE FIRST BESTOWAL OF T.HE BRUCE .MEDJJL
BY ROSE O'HALLORAN.
Miss Catherine Wolfe Bruce of New
York recently founded the Jlruoe medal
for the recognition of "distinguished
services to astronomy," and the first be
stowal took place on November 27, isy7.
at a special meeting of the directors of
the Astronomical Society of the Pacific,
which society Is the trustee of the endow
ment and award. The temporary si
lence enjoined by the statutes connected
therewith as to the person selected for
the honor expired when a letter of ac
ceptance arrived on this day from the
first recipient. Professor Simon X.w
comb of Washington, D. C. This emi
nent astronomer, whose recent address
at the dedication of the Terkes Observa
tory excited tsuch general Interest, is a
native of Nova Scotia; was educated at
the Lawrence Scientific School of Har
vard, and in IMil, when in his tw.-my
sixth year, was appointed professor of
mathfmatics In the United Btatea navy.
To his supervision was chiefly intrusted
the construction of the 26-inch telescope
of the Naval Observatory, at that time
the largest refractor yet designed. The
organization of the transit of Venus ex
peditions (IS74> also devolved on him, and
his own observations of that event wore
conducted at the Cape of Good Hope. But
his most enduring renown has been at
tained by his mathematical contributions
to astronomy, some of wnicb appeared as
early as ISM, and all of which show a
high order of talent, combined with a ca
pacity for assiduous mental labor. In
recognition of the value of these services,
and especially of his researches as to the
orbits of Uranus and Neptune, the gold
PROFESSOR SIMON NEWCO.MB,
medal of the Royal Astronomical So
ciety of Kngland was conferred on him
In 1574. The planets Uranus and Neptune,
which mutually disturb each other's el
liptic motion, being in a comparative
sense of recent discovery, observations
had not extended over a sufficiently long
period to allow extreme accuracy as to
their theoretic orbits, while the accumu
lating errors became Intolerable from an
astronomical standpoint as the years
went by. Only those versed in the calcu
lation of planetary orbits can appreciate
the amount of work done by the naval
professor and his assistants In this in
vestigation, which required a compari
son of the observations of the principal
observatories and years of computation
before the corrected tables of motion
were completed. Among other subjects
of his mathematical researches, before
and since, the following may be espec
ially named: The orbits of the Asteroids,
the distance of the sun, perturbations of
the moon's orbit by the planets, tables of
eclipses from B.C. 700 to A. D. 2300, a com
parison of Hansen's and Dolannay's lunar
theories, positions of fundamental stars,
transits of Mercury from MR to 1881,
development of the perturbative function
and its derivatives, periodic perturba
tions of the four inner planets, and the
value of the constants of precession,"
nutation and aberration. A mere enu
meration conveys no idea of the labor in
volved in the preparation of these works.
In nearly every case it was rebuilding
on a more enlightened plan what h.a<!
been attempted by gifted men in the
past, who were hampered by the de-

Not only the American Nautical Alma

1577 to 1897, but all the ephemerides of

his sixty-third year, Â».e is still engaged

Indebted to his researches for more ac
curate knowledge of the orbits of the
Inner plaints.
Few intellects, even when effort was
equally fostered by circumstances, have
laborer more efficiently to satisfy the
pressing needs of science. It seems, then,
very fitting tnat the name of Newcomb
should be inscribed on the first impress
of the Bruce medal for distinguished
services to astronomy. The selection is
not solely due to the judgment of the di
rectors of the Astronomical Society, as
the statutes for bestowal require that the
six following observatories be each re
quested to name not more than three per
sons worthy of the honor: Harvard Col
lege Observatory, Lick Observatory,
Yerkes Observatory, Observatory of
Paris. Observatory of Greenwich, Ob
servatory of Berlin. Some weeks are al
lowed to intervene between the arrival of
these lists of names and the selection
from among them of a medalist by the
concurrent votes of at least six directors.
Neither nationality nor sex acts as a de
barment from the award, but no indi
vidual can receive it more than once, nor
can it be conferred oftener than once a
year. The medal will be of gold, and
inscribed as in the illustration, the reverse
bearing the seal of the Astronomical So
ciety of the Pacific.
The cost is to be defrayed from the
interest of a fund of $2500, which is but
one of many gifts to science from tho
same noble benefactress, who, we are
proud to say, is a life member of the
society mentioned. To her the Lick Ob
servatory is indebted for large sums for
the purchase of a comet-seeker and two
photometers, for the employment of a
computer for the reduction of the ob
servations of Professor Schaberle when at
Ann Arbor, and also to aid the instal
lation of the Crossley reflector. But her
judicious liberality is free from narrow
ing partialities, and the Observatory of
Prague, Austria, has been aided with
$1000 for the publication of a valuable
atlas of the moon. The Yerkes Observa
tory was equipped with a s7ooo photograph
ic lens just suited to the work in which
Professor Barnard is engaged: the reno
vation of the Dudley Observatory, Al
bany, N. V., was encouraged by a' gift
of $25,000. and the Harvard researches in
South American skies are now facilitated
with a 24-inch photographic telescope at
a cost of $50,000. Such well-directed muni
ficence cannot fail to make the world
wiser and better in the present day and

which he laid on the desk of the hotel
with evident difficulty.
"What have you got there that's so
heavy?" said Mr. O'Brien from behind the
register as he handed the visitor a pen
with his accustomed grace.
"I'll show you," responded the gentle
man; and opening the rag he brought to
light a large-sized gold brick and watched
for the look of surprised admiration he
expected to see on the clerk's face. But
O'Brien has seen tco many gold bricks of
various kinds during his hotel experience,
so with the remark that all the suckers
were not yet dead, he proceeded to assign
a room to his guest.
"I'm no sucker," said the man with the
brick. "This is merely a piece of lead
heavily gilded over, which I have had
made especially for my stage line up
country. "You see, we are troubled con
siderably with road agents and some of
the boys have suffered considerably from
their depredations. Each of my drivers is
supplied with one of these bogus bricks,
which they hand out when they are held
up and the treasure they are carrying is
demanded. The highwayman invariably
bites and when he finds out how badly
he has been fooled he is so ashamed of
himself that he never comes in town and
complains."
When the mining man concluded he
looked up, and this time he was not dis
appointed. The clerk looked surprised.

* The third match for the Spreckels
Challenge Cup between the Fort Mason
Polo Team and the Lurline Swimming
Club will take place at the Lurline Baths j
this evening.
While the Lurllnes feel confident of
â¢winning, still the game promises to be a |
hotly contested one, owing to the fact :
that the Fort Masons have materially
strengthened their team by the addition
of two such veteran players as MacKillop
and Hawthorne.
At the last match the Fort Masons
were badly handicapped by the loss of two
of their most valuable members and this
accounts for the very large score the
Lurlines ran upâ they winning by 9 to 0.
It is with the view of wiping out this
Bcore that Captain Bailey has decided to
Etrengthen his team and the game prom
ises to be the closest of the series.
If possible the Lurline Club will endeav
or to send a team to Chicago during the

interesting as showing how the Western

twenty-four hours more will see all the

In sneaking of the coming Jubilee Pas
senger Agent Horsburgh paid: "To form

to sell limited excursion tlckei
.1 rates we sent what we cons
to l"- .in ample supply to each of our sta
tion agents, but already orders for more
excursion tickets have begun to pile in at
an astonishing rate.
"I think that in the larger cities the
most of the people who intend coming
have already made up their mlnfls, and
many of them have purchased tickets';
but in tho rural districts the case is Just
the opposite. A man in the country is
Influenced by what his neighbor

In army circles ><f this department
the impression is stronp that Colonel
Ludington will be the next chief quar

His past promotion, it is Bald, was
gained by reason of his splendid ahili

ord as a volunteer bef<rre he was ap
polnted in the regular army. The rank
of brigadier general was bestowed upon
him for gallant and meritorious ser

â¢'I think that this parade and Mining

it bring a vast multitude of pleasure

ADAM MURPHY ACQUITTED.
No Charge of Embezzlement Could
Star>d Against H'").
The case of the Portland CrmckÂ«r Com
pany against Adam H. Murphy, which
was a civil action charging the defend
ant with embezzlement and seeking a re
covery of the moneys embezzled, after a
bitterly fought contest occupying twelve
days, came to a conclusion in Judcre
Black* court yeslerdsy afternoon. The
(1. f. 11. lain by the unanimous verdict of
the jury wan acquitted of the charge of
embesslenx
Murphy had been general manager of
the corporation. In settling their ac
counts a dispute arose as to the amount
of his commislons. He claimed that his
commissions more than offset the moneys
in his hands: while the corporation
claimed that his commissions were less
than the moneys in his hands by $1500.
Murphy refused to pay over, claiming
that he was not indebted; and the cor
poration then brought a civil action
against him for embezzlement, and
â ought to have him Imprisoned until the
debt was paid.
On the question of whether there was
any indebtedness in the case the Jury
found a verdict for the plaintiff for $750,
three of the jurors dissenting. On the
issue of embezzlement the verdict was
unanimous for the defendant. Murphy's
attorneys moved for a judgment in the
case on the ground that, as the action
was based entirely upon the charge of
embezzlement, and as the jury found that
charge to be untrue, the defendant was
entitled to a judgment. Judge Slack
seemed to be of that opinion, but. on
motion of the attorney for the plaintiff.
the matter was set over two weeks to be
argued, the question being whether the
plaintiff should have a simple money
judgment for $750. or whether the Judg
ment should be to" the defendant.

Burglar.

Blow as She Emerges
From Her Room.
Desperate Crime in a Private
Lodging - House on
Kearny Street.
A SUSPECT UNDER ARREST.
The Police Are Convinced That They
Have the Right Man Under
Arrest.
Mrs. Vesta Smith, who conducts a
boarding-house at 238 Kearny street,
was the victim of a brutal robber early
yesterday morning.
Shortly after 2 o'clock Mrs. Smith,
who was attending a sick lodger, heard
a peculiar noise in the hallway. She
emerged from the room, and was con
fronted by an evil-looking man. who
askt d her if she was the landlady. She
said yes, whereupon the robber
struck her a stunning blow between the
eyes. As she fell senseless to the floor
her assailant hurriedly searched her
clothing, but failed to find anything of
value. He then darted down stairs
and made his escape. Mrs. Smith re-
OOYered consciousness a short time af
terward, and after considerable effort
managed to reach her own apartments.
Throwing herself on her bed she re
lapsed into unconsciousness and re
mained in that condition until 6 o'clock,
when a friend succeeded in arousing
her. The police were at once notified
and Detectives Cody and Dinan were
detailed to find the criminal.
Last evening they arrested a noto
rious character named Campbell, and
locked him op in the tanks pending an
investigation.
The suspect is well known to the po
lice. Severe] jrean ago he gained con
! siderable notoriety through his asso
ciation with the notorious Sydney Bell,
who is undergoing a life sentence in the
I penitentiary for highway robbery.
j Campbell turned State's evidence, and
| was discharged from custody.
From the description given of her aa
pailant by Mrs. Smith the detectives are
satisfied that they have the right man.
Ij.iPt night the unfortunate woman was
still confined to her bed from the ef
| fects of the blow. To-day she will
visit the City Prison for the purpose
j of identifying her supposed assailant.

BLYTHE CASE.
The Decree Amended and a New
Ejectroent Complaint Filed
in the Matter.
T'nited States Circuit Judge Morrow
yesterday granted the motion of E. Burke
Holladay. of counsel for the Kentucky
Blythes, to amend the final decree of the
court in the matter of the Blythe estate.
so as not to bar Mr. Holladay's clients
from beginning other actions in the mat
ter. The amendment consisted of the ad
dition of the words "For want of federal
or equitable jurisdiction and without
prejudice to the plaintiffs' right to bring
or maintain an action at law."
An amended complaint in the action of
ejectment brought by the Kentucky
B'ythes against Florence Blythe Hinck
ley was tiled later on.

the eight companies of the regiment and
Adjutant-General Barrett and Brigadier-
General Warrield were also present. The
subject of the parade on Monday was
discussed, and it being made to appear
that all the companies of the regiment
cannot comply with the order to appear
in full-dress uniform, for the reason that
several of the companies have never re
ceived such uniforms, permission to ap
pear In service uniform was granted.
The subject of rille practice was taken
up and discussed. Ihe expressed opinion
was that at this tjme it is in a very un
satisfactory mariner. The regimental rirle
inspector was instructed to prepare rules
to conform with the revised rul>'s.
Colonel Fairbanks gave the officers an
outline of the work to be performed by
the several companies during the year in
order that there shall be a uniform sys
tem in performing that work.

OUR FOREIGN TRADE.
EUROPE IS INDEBTED TO THIS COUN
TRY IN LARGE AMOUNTS.
The circular of Henry Clews, under flat* of
New York, January 15, says:
"During the past week, the course of the
stock market has followed the direction fore
shadowed in our advices of the Sth instant.
The investment movement has been very ac
tive, and railroad bonds have made further
advances. in which the dividend paying stocks
have also participated. Naturally, the move
ment In stocks has sympathized with the im
provement in bonds. The transactions report
ed on the Stock Exchange have averaged about
450.000 shares per day; and the tone of busi
ness Is distinctly firmer and prices have
steadily risen. The outside 'element Is bring
ing- Into the market considerable amounts, de
rived from dividends and Interest payments,
for transient employment and altogether the
feeling preponderates strongly in favor of a
steady upward course of values. For a time
this prospect has to contend with realizing by
parties who were caught by the large drop
in prices during the fall; this, however, is only
a transient incident, and when it disappears
prices will be more free to respond to the
pronounced bullish sentiment, and more or less
of a 'boom' may be developed.
"The foreign markets begin to show a turn
in favor of New York, not only in London but
still more at Amsterdam and Berlin, from
which some Important buying orders have been
received during the week. At the moment, the
condition of the foreign exchanges is against
European buying of our securities. . Large
amounts, aggregating probably not less than
$40,000,000, are due to this country by the Eu
ropean centers, which are permitted to run
for the sake of the difference between local
and foreign rates of interest. A similar con
dition of things has existed for some months
past: and this fact has a natural tendency
not only to check foreign buying of our secu
rities, but to induce realizations here. On the
one hand. United States' takings of European
merchandise have been diminished, and on the
other, foreign purchases of our food products
have been very largely Increased through short
crops in nearly all the other supply coun
tries. This has inevitably brought home a

Iscbars, or solid lines, connect points of equal I
air pressure; Isotherms, or dotted lines, equal |
temperature. The word "high" means high !
barometric pressure and is usually accompanied
by fair weather: "low" refers to low pres
sure and is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
firpt appear on the Washington coast. When
the pressure is high In the interior and low
along the coast, and th" isobars extend north
and south alone the coast, rain Is probable:
but when the "low" is inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is Im
probable. With a "high" In the vicinity of i
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Cali- [
fornia coast, warmer weather may be expected
In summer and colder weather In winter. The
reverse of these conditions will produce an
opposite result.

EASTERN MARKETS.
KBW YORK BTOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Jan.. 20.â Slight losses resulted
from to-Â«lny's transactions. the stock market,
which was irregular and depreÂ«s>ed on the re
fsumrtion of Cuban and currency agitation at
"Washington, â 'â â¢:: courage to certain large
bear interests. Recent professional manipula
tion or stocks Is credited to people Interested
In making a market for bonds acquired during
the reorganizations. Western trade advices
continued good and further reflected favorable
traffic returns which were published to-day by
prominent railroad lines. The market had
hardly recovered from its early hesitancy when
liquidation and rhort pales were apparent with
resultant sharp declines. Toward the close
there "wan i! eomewhat improved tone and ln
creoped activity. London bought a little on
balance. Oregon Improvement advanced 1% on
an Intimation of poMible changes In that com
panv'n relations with other properties In the
Northwest. Northern Pacific and Union Pa
cific were purchased for London account. The
money market continued to display extreme
ease, round amounts being offered on call at 3
ptr cent. This condition of affairs waa re
garded by come of the leading exchange lnter
â  ests as offsetting possible imports which in a
measure would be Justified by the current ex
change situation
The bond market continued to reflect a sub
stantial outside Interest which was responsible
for notable improvements In some of the low
grade liens. The aggregate transactions were
â  $3,7S>7.O<X>. The Government bond market was
1 neglected with slight concessions In bid price
j in some Issues.

LONDON MARKETS.
NEW YORK. Jan. 20â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram sajls: The stock
market here opened dull to-day, but closed
quiet, consols leading in the recovery. The
bull point used was the decline in the Germsji
i bank rate. The features in Americans was the
j rush for Klondike groups, thus Denver and
! Rio Grande. Canadian Pacific and Northern
I Pacific were bought wildly.
New York is now absorbing Canadian Pa-
I ciflcs. Grand Trunks are also still booming.
Spanish. Turkish and International stocks
] were sold from Paris, but Etto Tlnto copper
I was the feature of strength. In spite of the
j apparent ease in money here to-day, there la a
; steadier tone to the market.
MONET MARKET.
NEW YORK. Jan. 20.â Apparently the only
thing that prevents gold imports Is the extreme
easiness of money here, which Is on the basis
of 1%@3 per cent for call loans and demand
sterling, which was quoted at $4 S4@4 84% to
day, with the supply apparently being more
than equal to the demand.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Jan. 20.â 1n wheat Liverpool
prices showed about %d advance at the open-
Ing hour, and this marked showing of strength
naturally had. great effect on the market here.'
May; which closed yesterday at 91>4c. opened
to-day at 91%<5'91 4c. while July showed a
still greater advance, starting *i@%c higher at
*3 V 3"S|C. Trade was very Blow for an hour
and a half, and fluctuations during that time
were practically confined to the fractional dif
ferences of opening trade. Hut It improved
later, especially In July. The Liverpool ad
vance was supposed to be the result of less
pressure from Argentine to sell wheat. This
theory was partially confirmed by a cable
gram stating . that $2,500,000 gold that nail
been ordered for shipment from London to
Argentina had been canceled, and one from a
Buenos Ayres correspondent of a Milwaukee
house putting the exportable surplus of Ar
gentina at 19,000,000 bushels. London quoted
the price of Argentina wheat, March. 33s 3d,
which Is Is above the price it was being of
fered at about a week ago, or a rise in that
time of equivalent to 8c per bushel. The re
ceipts at Minneapolis > and Duluth were 307
cars, against 833 a week ago and 362 the cor
responding week of last year. . Chicago re
ceipts were 85 cars, compared with 29 a year
ago. Of to-day's receipts only 2 cars were
contract, but 14,000 bushels besides were put
in store from unlicensed warehouses.
After 11 o'clock the trade took on some de
gree of activity. May in the meantime had
risen to 92yiS92Ue, The Letter party sold that
future at over 41%e. but bought Quietly, and
TIIE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 21, 1898.
as the price of July has gone up pretty easily
lately the purchases of Lelter frightened them
to covering. The consequence was an advance
, to 844 c. while May was. hanging around 924 c.
; The receipts of the closing cables showed
! weakness in the foreign markets and in a
i measure restored the confidence of the shorts
and Induced them to again put out their
lines, and during the afternoon prices suffered
: a considerable relapse. The Liverpool market
closed with a net gain of from %d to %d.
Paris at a loss of from 10 centimes to 20 cen
times for flour and 10 to 16 centimes for
wheat: Antwerp lower by 25 centimes for red
winter and 124 centimes for Walla Walla. May
declined to and closed steady at 91% c. while
! July was bringing 83% cat the close.
Corn was an exceedingly narrow market.
; There was plenty of bull news, which met
with little response. May ranged from 29@29%c
to 29% c and closed %c higher at 29c.
The market for oats was quiet but firm. The
! feature was the continued buying for New
York account. May ranged from 23%(523%c to
.â Â±3\c and closed %c higher at 23% c.
Provisions were strong throughout. At the
J start there was scarcely any trading, but as
; the strength developed in wheat the short in
1 terest In provisions began to cover and the
I demand soon became active, prices advancing
I rapidly. At the close May pork was 20c high

EDIBLE "COFFINS."
At a very early period the Orientals
were familiar with a kind of pastry, a
mixture of flour, oil and honey, and for
centuries pastry-making went no fur
ther, even among the nations in the
south of Europe. But in the beginning
of the Middle Ages a change began to
take place in the method of mixing
the ingredients, and some other sub
stances were brought into use. Butter,
eggs and salt found their way into pas
try-making, and the result was a
manifest improvement. Paste next
came to be used as an Inclosure for
meat, seasoned with spices, etc. After
ward it went a step further, the next
us- being for the inclosure of creams,
fruit, preserves, etc., and later still it
began to take the many fanciful shapes
in which it has since been commonly
found. In the early stages of English
cookery the pastry cases were called
coffins or â¢'coffynes," and were made
In various sizes from "gret coffynes
with low liddes" for the "tartes of
fflesche," to the" smalle coffynes" for
"tartolettes" of "fische or fflesche.''
mixed with "stuf of boylled figges
ground and good powdure and spices."
Petruchio, in "The Taming of the
Shrew,*" it may here be noted, calls a
little cap "a custard coffin." These cof
fins correspond with the " vol-au-vent"
of to-day. The art of making very
light pastry, such as puff paste, is
probably a modern one, but pastry of
several kinds was anciently used. For
meat pastry butter was dissolved in
boiling water and worked into a soft
mass with fine flour. As It cooled It
would set in any form desired An
other paste of a flaky kind was made
very much as at present, while still
another kind, called pam puff, was
made of fine flour and the yelk of an
egg. no water at all being used This
was for the finer kinds of con
festlonery.â -Gentleman's Magazine.
"Maud," said Mr. Dobbs. sternly,
"why did you refuse young Bliven? A
fin*- younp man, whose heart is in the
ripht place."
"Well, it wasn't when he proposed to
me," answered Maud, flippantly, "for it
was in his mouth."â Harper's Bazar
Dawkinsâ How's your indigestion
old man?
Phillipsâ Tfs (Joins nicely, thank you
but I don't feel very well myself.âHar

CONFIDENCE
IS RESTORED
Merchants and Representative
Men Well Pleased With
the Outlook.
Joseph Simon of Portland Speaks
Concernincj Matters of
Interest.
Joseph Simon. ex-Mayor of Portland,
a bright political light throughout the
ooast and connected with the legal firm
of Simon & Doff, arrived in this city yes
terday in company with George A. Steel,
well known in business and political cir
cles. They bare takon apartments at the
Palace, and during their stay U-gul and
personal matters in which they arc inter
ested will be attendf-d to.
Business and political interfMs are re
ported by them to be in a condition sult
aule to the prosperous times, and the
general confidence which has fathered
among the representative men of the
country has greatly aided in making af
fairs what they at present are. The
Klondike excitement has tended to cir
culate money heretofore stagnant, and a
year of contentment is predicted. Mr.
Simon said last evening: "As Is wÂ»-U
known our election is held in June in
stead of the usual month of November.
The State Central Committee will meet
on the 2d day of February, and even at
the present time political lireles are be
coming interested In the fight which will
soon be at hand. The State as well as
th>' general ticket will be elected at that
time, and I am of the opinion that the
sound-money followers will carry the day
by a handsome majority. In the natural
course of things a hard fight will neces
sarily be made, but I look for a larger
majority for prosperity and sound money
than was procured last year.
"Business interests are looking brighter
and taken all in all we have reasons for
re-juicing. Wheat-growers are branching
out and a large yield will be the result.
I account for this for the reason that a
general confidence has boen restored
through the election of McKlnJey, and
the sarnn ticket will lead at the next
election."
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 21, 1898.
SPORTS IN
WATTS TRACT
A Fistic Carnival Given
by the Oakland
Club.
Some Lively Work That Was a
Good Return for thÂ©
Money.
Captain Fletcher Receives Some SÂ©
vere Punishment in the
Stomach.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 20.
The boxing craze has struck the
Watts Tract. In past times, before that
neighborhood was the thriving and
prosperous settlement that It now is,
many dark tales of fights came from
that vicinity. But now all this is
changed, and the civilized method of
settling questions of supremacy is re
sorted to. To-night the Oakland Ath
letic Club, which has a capacious gym
nasium at B and Hollis streets, held
a fistic carnival, in which many young
Oaklanders distinguished themselves
and otherwise. These carnivals, which
have been held occasionally for several
months, are star events in North Oak
land, and now that San Francisco, on
account of a passing spasm of virtue
among the Supervisors, has declined to
permit exhibitions of the art for the
present, crowds that are quite fash
ionable can be found at the unpreten
tious Oakland club rooms.
Several young artists were tried out
to-night. Mike McCormick and Joe
Kane, who once fought eight rounds
before the Reliance dub, resulting in
a verdict for Kane, were in the ring
for eight rounds and gave the crowd a
fine exhibition. This was the star
event of the evening, and a goodly por
tion of the gate proceeds went to the
winner.
Jakey Raumgard, whom everybody In
Oakland knows, once secured a victory
over Josh Ward, and ever since that
time Ward has been anxious for an op
portunity to win back his lost laurels.
To-night the chance came, and the two
little fellows went through eight
rounds in good syle.
Jimmy Rlley, who once had a battle
with a gentleman named Yankee Sav
age, was matched against Jimmy Ca
sey, who is almost an unknown, and for
half an hour these two kept up a lively
contest in the ring. Altogether the as
sembled sports concluded that they had
received a good return for the modest
price of admission. Spike Hennessy,
spikes and all, presided over the cere
monies and in his opening speech
hinted very broadly that unless per
fect behavior were preserved no cere
mony would be folio-wed in ejecting the
offender. Captain Fletcher of the police
force was also present and stated after
ward that the entertainment had been
so humorous throughout that he had
laughed till his stomach was sore; in
fact, he said that he believed he had re
ceived worse punishment than any of
those who went into the ring.

WANTED TO GO
BACK TO CHINA
Lav Sun Ho Asks Uncle Sam
to Pay Her Passage
Home.
She Swore When She Arrived. That
She Was a Native of
California.
Lav Sun Ho, alias Chee Tuet Qu.ls tired
of living In San Francisco and desires the
United States Government to pay her
passage back to the flowery kingdom.
Ho arrived here on the Peru from Hong
kong In December, IÂ£?6. and was landed
In January, ISS7, upon furnishing proof to
the Collector of the Port that she was a
native of California.
Ho was a slave and was Imported for
immoral purposes. She appeared to ac
cept her lot with resignation and did the
will of her masters until recently, when
she became tirr-d of living In California
and wanted to go back to China. She ac
cordingly went to the. Methodist Mission
and declared that she wished to be re
deemed from her life of slavery. She
confessed that she was born in China and
not in California, and that she had been
landed on false and fraudulent pretenses.
This confession was reported to the Chi
nese bureau and yesterday Inspector
John Lynch swore to a complaint in the
clerk s office of the T'nlt^d States District
<'ourt charging the woman with having
jfaln*-'! admission to this country by false
und fraudulent representations, and ask
ing that she be deported to China.
ThÂ»Â» woman was arrested and brought
before Judge de Haven, where she was
asked whether she had any choice of an
attorney, ghe replied that Mr. Monroe,
the attorney for the mission, would be ac
ceptable to'her. 'i hen she became fidgety
and rÂ«-<fuested to be allowed to confer
with <'urn Lung, a Chinese business man
of good repute. After a short conversa
tion with Cum Lung she decided that
Thomas D. Riordan should be her attor-
ney.
The examination will take place before
T'nited States Commissioner Heacock, at
11 o'clock to-morrow morning.
It nppc-ars that after Miss Ho had been
in the mission for some days messages
were secretly conveyed to her from her
masters warning her against the action
she was taking and threatening her with
death if she did not return to her old
life. Thest> threats alarmed not only her
but the mission people ns well, and they
feared that an attempt at forcible res
cue would be made. Hence the Federal
authorities were Informed of the matter.
A NEW CONVENT.
Select Institution) Soon to Be In
augurated at Pasadena by
OaK'and Sisters.
Pasadena is soon to have a new con
vent, under charge of the Sisters of the
Holy Names.
Mother Delphlne of that order, who re
cently became mother provincial of the
convents in California and superior of the
Convent of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart
in Oakland, taking Mother Elizabeth's
place, has gone to Pasadena with Sister
Mary Symphorosa to select a site for the
convent and pass upon the plans for a
building.
The convent and the school that will
be attached to the institution will be par
ticularly select and promises to be one of
the most successful in the State.
Tho sisters in charge will be Sister
Rose of the Passion. Sister Agnes of
Mary and Sister Nobertine.
TRADE STAMPS NOT FAVORED.
Merchants' Association Lining Up
Against Gifts With Purchases.
Shortly after the trading stamp people
Introduced their scheme of distributing
goods on stamps obtained from the mer
chants with whom they had business
dealings In this city the Merchants' As
sociation discussed the matter. Its mem
bers claiming that the system Is sure to
â work a hardship on the business com
munity.
In order to get a general expression as
to the advantages or disadvantages <_r the
proposition. President Dohrmann and
Secretary Freud have sent letters of In
quiry to members of the Merchants' As
sociation. The letter recites that the
Board of Supervisors has passed an ordi
nance prohibiting the giving of "presents"
with purchases, but that the officials de
sire further expression of opinion of the
members of the association. As a leader
the secretary asks three questions.
Tho first is if the Individual members
favor the establishment of the trade
stamp system in San Francisco: the sec
ond Is if they believe that the association
should actively oppose its establishment;
and third, if they will attend a meeting
of the association at .which the subject
will be discussed. With the letter is sent
a copy of the "gift scheme" ordinance
and of the letter to the association from
the Supervisors. Secretary Freud said
that of the 927 members of the body he
has yet to hear the first merchant express
himself in favor of the plan. About forty
mi'mlicra handle the stamps, but these
are making the hardest tight against the
proposition. Ho expects that a meeting
of the association will be held soon and
from what he can learn believes that the
sentiment will be against the trade
stamp scheme.
Off for the K'ondiKe.
Officer Chambers of Captain Sptllane's
division has sent In his resignation- to the
Police Commissioners. He leaves In a few
days for the Alaska gold Holds
fln Insolvent Clerk.-
Sidney Lacey, a clerk by occupation,
has been declared insolvent. The Insol
vent schedules hla liabilities at 11557. He
has no assets.
THE CHINESE
NEW YEAR DAYS
The Mongolian Element of
the City Is Much
Agitated.
ThÂ« Holiday Season Comes on Wtih
â  Renewal of the Old Society
War.
Chinatown is agitated almost to fighting
point over the perplexing question which
Is the proper day to celebrate their New
Year. The dispute has already divided the
Mongolian quarter along the old lines of
the Sam Yup and See Yup feud, and the
upshot is that two different New Year
days will be kept and two calendars fol
lowed by these two factions throughout
the year in the Chinese communities of
the United States.
It appears that ever since the Chinese
came to California in 1549 there has been
a mistake of a d v In the local almanacs.
It is well known to trans-Pacific passen
gers coming from Japan to the United
States that when the lS'Hh meridian is
crossed in mid-Pacific one day is added
to that week and one day is dropped in
going west. The Chinese, regardless of
our geographical and astronomical sci
ence, counted right on, making no allow
ance for changes of time and place with
the result that their computation of time
is a day too fast. About four months ago
the new Chinese Minister, Win-Ting-Fang,
acting under the orders of the Tsung-!i
Yamen at Peking, 6et himself to rectify
ing the local calendar. The different Con
suls in the United States, Mexico and
Peru were commanded to instruct their
fellow countrymen in these places to ob
serve- Saturday, January 22, as the offi
cial day. The local consulate accordingly
issued a proclamation to that effect about
two weeks ago.
It is this ko shl that has driven China
town frantic. Whole cargoes of almanacs
and calendars printed in China are worth
less, and the booksellers are filled with
rage. Moreover all kinds of woes and
disasters are predicted to follow this im
pious interference with the Infallible al
manac of the gods.
The Chinese legation Is desirous of
making the home and foreign celebrations
synchronize as nearly as possible, and
also to avoid the bad form of celebrating
here before the year has begun in China.
It must be borne in mind that every Chi
nese New Year adils another year to the
Kmperor's age and reign. Now, if the
event is observed here on Friday the offi
cial telegraphic dispatch of congratula
tions would rf-ach his Majesty a day too
soon, and the local consular officials,
whose custom Is In the dawn of every
new year morning to proceed to the Six
Companies" chamber on Commercial street
and prostrate themselves before the Em
peror's tablet, would be rendering- homage
to their sovereign many hours before the
twenty-fourth year of Quong Sul had
dawned. This is why the officials are de
sirous of rectifying tho calendar.
It is all very puzzling to the average
Chinaman. Everybody knows that his
year and month follows the moon. Their
new year always happens at the first new
moon after the sun enters Aquarius,
that is, between the 21st of January and
tho 19th of February, and as the new
moon occurs on Friday, the 21st. at 11:23
p. m., the majority of Chinese instst that
Friday Is the proper day. The more en
lightened Chinese understand the prob
lem an>l nre disposed to obey the minis
ter's mandate, but there is a mass of Ig
norant, superstitious rabble who pin their
faith to an oracle like the European Zad
kiel. and are breathing defiance at tho
minister for his faring interference with
the "decrees of Heaven" and the "order
of nature" In attempting to lengthen the
year. The populace attribute this to his
excellency's Christian faith and well
known foreign proclivities. Poth he and
the local officials have been denounced in
filthy vituperative placards pasted on the
walls of Chinatown.
To pacify tho excited communltv the
original proclamation has been withdrawn
and another Issued explaining that the
Minister and Consul-General have no per
sonal interest in the matter and are sim
ply acting under orders from Peking. As
the matter now stands r.o compromise is
possible. The Sam Yups and the Chris
tian missions will keep Saturday as New
Year's day. while the obstinate See Yups
will k^ep Friday and follow the old calen
dar throughout the year, and cursed Is
every other son of Han who departs from
orthodox traditions to follow the crazy
notions of foreign devils.
A curious ceremony was observed two
nights ago in the homes of the Chinese.
Toward the close of every year Tsow
Kwan. the god of the kitchen, the prin
cipal household deity, is supposed to as
cend to tho skies and make his report to
Yuk Wong. thÂ«^ Pearly Emperor, of the
conduct of the household during the year.
Everything that has transpired, good or
bad. must he faithfully reported to this
supreme ruler of the terrestrial gods.
Little Tsow Kwan Is made of paper and
is burned along with a paper horse. Su
perstitions women believe they see him
seated on his horse, mounting up through
the flames and smoke to the sky. Before
he departs It is customary to regale him
with large quantities of sticky candy and
sugar, the. purpose of which is to cause
his lips to stick together so close that he
will be unable to inter a word to Yuk
Wong. Tn sumo homes a feast is prepar
ed for him and ditties sung or burned in
his honor. The following Is a transla
tion of one of such effusions:
Come, god of the kitchen, dear grand
father "Wong.
Come, here is your candy, and here Is
your Tong.
Now flit up to heaven, begone In a trice.
Forget all that's naughty, tell only
what's nice.
On the last night of the year Tsow
Kwan will return and take his place in
the new kitchen shrine prepared for him.
Another feast Is set and sacrifices of
fered to secure his good will and protec
tion of the household during the coming
year. The leading idea among the Chi
nese at New Year's time is that with the
new year a fresh lease of life begins, the
record of the year's conduct is complet
ed, the ledger Is closed and a new era
dawns. This week all accounts must be
settled, debts paid and old grudges for
given. A general cleaning up Is going on
in Chinatown, stores are being cleaned,
whitewashed and painted, the accumula
lations of a year's cobwebs and dust
swept away, these ablutions to conclude
with a fusillade of firecrackers to drive
out the ghosts and hobgobbllns of the old
year.

TRIOL OF DR. SAMUEL HALL
Prosecutlor) Rested Its Case Yes
terday and To-Day the Defense
Will Have ar> Inr>iog.
The prosecution In the trial of Dr. Hall,
who Is charged with the murder of Mrs.
Ida Coakley, rested Ita case yesterday
afternoon. The case came to such a sud
den halt that v> - hen the defendant was
called upon to present his side his at
torneys explained that they were taken
by surprise and would like to have a
continuance gTanted until this morntnp.
The request was granted by Judge Dunne,
and the case will probably be ready to go
to the Jury to-morrow.
During yesterday's proceedings several
witnesses testified, but the most import
ant evidence wad given by Mrs. Wells,
a daughter of the defendant. Dr. F. B.
Robinson and John Coakley, the husband
of the woman who it is claimed was ,
murdered by Dr. Hall. Mrs. Wclla testi- !
fled as to the dead woman's visits to j
the home of Dr. Hall for treatment, i
and also shed some light upon several ;
Important Issues In the case. Dr. Rob- !
inson was subpoenaed as an expert In |
the case, and In his opinion death was
caused by a criminal operation. Coakley
was extremely nervous on the stand, and
had to be admonished time and again by
counsel and the "ourt to prevent him
from making statements that might be
used against him when the charge against
him comes to trial. He was almost in
tears when he was finally allowed to step
from the stand. Nothing Important was
wrung from the lips of Coakley. and when
he left the Ftand the prosecution rested ;
Its case. To-day the defense will have its ,
turn, and perhaps the prosecution may â 
have an opportunity to put on witnesses
la rebuttal. If this is the case Dr. Hall ;
will either be a free man or a convict I
to-morrow.

FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS GONE IN FLAMES.
The Union Box Factory, With All Its Contents, Totally Destroyed by Fire Last Evening Desoite the Efforts of
the Fire Department,
THE FIRE SEEN FROM THE DOME OF THE CLAUS SPRECKELS BUILDING.
The rnlon Box Factory, North Beach owned by A. M. Simpson, was totally destroyed by fire last night. Not a box or a cord of wood In the ad
joining yard was sav<-d.
Shortly after 8:15 o'clock. Night Watchman Crowley while making his rounds of the btiilding detected flames In the sawdust bin situated In
the northwest corner of the factory, and at once ran to the auxiliary fire box and sounded nn alarm. He had barely done this and 'reaped from the
rear of the building when the entire factory was In dames. on gaining the street he rushed to the barn In the rear of the building where the horses
are stalled and succeeded in getting the thirteen frightened animals out of the burning building.
By this time flames were burptlng forth from the roof and sides of the doomed factory and were rapidly spreading to the lumber yard adjoining
The shingles on the roof being detached from their position were carried hundreds of feet beyond, descending In a fusillade among the dwelling houses
on Francisco street, and crossing Telegraph Hill, falling like a meteoric shower in the bay. Terror-stricken people wÂ«?re out on their roofs delugine
them with water, but fortunately no damage was dono by the fiery missiles.
At the time the fire broke out there were 200,000 boxes of ai order of 350,000 awaiting shipment to the Alaska salmon fisheries Thes- were a
total loss.
Shortly after S o'clock the Fire Department arrived on the scene and under the direction of Assistant Chief Doherty endeavored to get the
flames under control. The Chief seeing that the lumber yard was doomed endeavored to protect the surrounding building? and for thN purpose sta
tioned batteries on the adjoining streets. For two hours they kept steady streams pouring into the factory and among the lumber piles hut made no
apparent headway. It was not until 10 o'clock, and after the flames had extended to the utmost precincts of the box-factory property, that they made
any showing toward conquering the flames.
Acting Chief Doherty commanded one of the effective batteries on Powell street, while Assistant Chief Wells took charge of the other on Bay
street. As soon as these engines were put to work their execution was effective and th*> great volumes of smoke that rose from the burning piles of
lumber clearly indicated that the flames were under control. At the outbreak of the fire the lumber yard across on Powell street took fire from the
flying embers of the box factory and attention had to be immediately din eted toward preventing a spread of the flames in this direction
The total lees of the Union Box Factory and the lumber yard, owned by the same firm, is estimated at about fifty tbousai â¢dollars The 1
ance on the property, if any, was small. The loss to the California Wire Works is estimated at $2000. This loss cbnsists in damage to marhin-rJ

It Is all due to the rusfi to the Klon

to explain the cause of the present coal
famine, and then they add, with a
unanimity that shows they know
whereof they speak, that the situation
will grow worse until the return of
warm weather lessens the demand from
household consumers.
There is not a pound of coal In the
market available for the retail trade
and only one cargo is due to arrive

The Black Diamond Company recent
ly chartered the steamer Progreso for
this purpose for three months for $65,
000, almost as much as she would earn
in a year on her regular run. Every
steam schooner, even, that can make
the voyage to Alaska and can be se
cured at any price has been gobbled up
for the Klondike trade, leaving the coal
and lumber dealers in a helpless posi
tion.
A visit to the various wholesale' coal
dealers yesterday disclosed a condition
that cannot fail to cause anxiety among
all classes, and not one of the mer
chants could see where there is any
chance for improvement during the
next sixty days. So far there has been
no movement to advance prices, but as
one gentleman put it: "What's the use
of advancing the price when you have
no coal to sell?"
The Oregon Coal and Navigation \
Company, owning the Coos Hay
mines, while owning its own boats, is
without a ton of coal on hand. This
is due to the rough weather that has
prevailed and the impossibility of its
steamers to cross the Coos Ray bar. It
owns two steamers that under favora
ble conditions can land 1100 tons a
week here, but both vessels are now j
barbound and thers is- no telling when I
they can get out.

John Rosenf eld's Sons have 1400 tons

this is all required by their contract ,

them until she can make another round !
trip, for their other collier, the Peter [
Jebsen, is now on the way to Fan Di- i
ego and cannot land a cargo of coal
here inside of twenty days at best.
The Beaver Hill Company has a small
supply on hand which is being nursed
as carefully as an invalid infant, and
the Dunsmuir Company is parceling
out the few tons it has on hand in the
same manner as Mj. Chandler and the
others are, pending the arrival of the
