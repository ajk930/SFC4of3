PARIS, Sept. 23.â A tragedy
which shows the extent to which the
people's feelings are worked up m
connection with the Dreyfus case oc
curred in Paris last evening.
At a quarter past 6 o'clock a sty
lishly dressed woman called at the
offices of La Lanterne and asked to
see M. Millerand, the editor. He
was out, but she positively refused
to depart, and as she appeared very
excited M. Ollivier, the secretary, was
summoned. % He said: "I, Mme.
Paulmier, I have the right to answer
lor M. Millerand."
M. Paulmier, a deputy, had sent a
lecter to General Zurlinder, while the
latter was Minister of War, implor
ing him to put a stop to the attacks
on the army. La lanterne replied
with an article in which M. Paul
mier's private affairs wsre freely, if
not libelously, discussed, and the
name of his wife was dragged in.
Hence the lady's indignation. She
would see M. Millerand, she declared,
and when M. Ollivier repeated that
he was not on the premises she de
clared she would take the matter into
her own hands, and drawing a re
volver fired six shots point black.
Two took effect. M. Ollivier was
examined by a doctor, who stated
that his condition was serious. The
first bullet lodged in his chest and
the second in his groin. The latter
Is likely to cause serious trouble, as
the latest reports are rather alarm
ing.
Mme. Paulmier expresses sorrow
that under the pressure of nervous
excitement she shot an innocent man,
and declares that she will still find
A. HTlileiand. Of course she was de
tained in custody.
The military authorities have accom
plished their plan of stifling Colonel
Picquart by placin~ him au secret.
Colonel Picquart's friends have been de

LONDON, Sept. 23.â According to
special dispatches received from Pe
king members of the European com
munity there believe the life of the Em
peror of China is in danger. It Is add
ed that the Dowager Empress desires
to place Prince Kung's grandson on the

EMPRESS' RETURN NOT
â¢ DICTATED 3Y RUSSIA
WASHINGTON Sept. 23.â The Chi
nese Minister, Mi Tu Wing, to-day re
ceived a cable d'> ; atch from the Chi
nese Foreign Office at Peking giving
the text of the edict issued by the Em
peror yesterday, in which, owing to
the critical condition of Chinese affairs,
he calls back to power the Empress
Dowager and commits to her hands the
direction of the vast affairs of the em
pire. The edict, freely translated from
the cipher cable, is as follows:
Now that China is disturbed, there els
need that all business shall be done well,
and we, the Emperor, agitated from
morning to night for the welfare of af
fairs and fearful lest errors may occur,
observing from the beginning of the
reign of Tung Chi that the Empress Dow
ager had twlre given instructions to the
Emperor and with signal ability and suc
cess, so we now, considering the import
ant interests of the empire, have bepgrd
the Empress Dowager to give the em
pire the benefit of her ripe experience
and her instruction. The Dowager Em
press has been pleased to accede to this
The San Francisco Call.
La Liberte predicts important action
by the council on Tuesday which may
result in the convoking of the Cham
bers.
Everything tends to confirm the
opinion thr.t General Zurlinden, in or
dering the military trial of Colonel Pic
quart, acted entirely upon his own in
itiative.
The Temps declares that the Cabinet
has previously refused to sanction Gen
eral Zurllnden's proposal to prosecute
Colonel Picquart, and that General Zur
iinden, therefore, waited until he had
resumed the military Governorship of
Paris, when he acted upon his own au
thority.
Upon leaving the prison Colonel Pic
quart had a portmanteau and a port
folio. He looked pale and careworn.
The blinds of the fiacre were drawn di
rectly he entered it.
A mob, which had been howling out
side the prison, rushed toward Picquart
as he emerged, shaking their fists and
shouting, some for and some against
him. A similar mob waited at the
Cherche Midi Prison. A detachment of
military in both cases protected Pic
quart.
A majority of the papers denounce
this militarv coup with various degrees
of severity. M. Clemenceau, in the Au
rore, charges M. Brisson with coward
ice or imbecility, and couples President
Faure's^ name with that of General
Zurlinden in the alleged plot to sup
press the truth and defeat justice. M.
Clemenceau dwells strongly on the
"mauvaises chances" of the Cherche
Midi Prison, and credits the ex-War
Minister with the remark:
"If General Mercier had not been so
soft-hearted he would have had Drey*
fus murdered."
Another paper, Droits de I'Homme,
abuses M. Faure with the jcreatest vir
ulence and accuses him of employing
M. Brieson to make a coup d'etat. It
points out that President Faure's mili
tary friends hold all the strong posts.
The final meeting of the commission
to consider the subject of revision,
which was fixed for Tuesday, has been
postponed until 9 o'clock to-morrow
morning, when a report will be drafted.
It is stated in ministerial circles that
the report will advise that Sarrien,
Minister of Justice, is in favor of revi
sion.
M. Brisson, the Premier, opposed the
convocation of the chambers on the
ground that the revision question is
purely a governmental matter.
request, and, therefore. It Is to the good
fortune of the whole empire that this
auspicious event Is brought about. From
to-aay the Empress Dowager conducts
the business in the imperial apartments
and on the eighth day of the present
month (Chinese calendar) we will take
all the Princes and Ministers to perform
the ceremony In the Chin Chung palace.
Let the Yamen (Foreign Office) prepare
that the ceremony may be performed
with fitting honors.
The Chinese Minister was seen at the
legation to-day and talked freely con
cerning the edict. He said there was no
secrecy about It, nothing to indicate
that it was a triumph of one foreign
element over another, and that its es
sential purpose was to strengthen
China herself at a time when serious
foreign problems were presented.
Concerning the report that the Em
press' return to power was a coup
d'etat favorable to Russia, the Min
ister say he does not consider the move
favorable to any power as against any
other. Its effect, he says, would be
toward strict impartiality in China's
treatment of Russia, Great Britain,
Germany, France, the United States,
Japan and the world at large.
As to its effect upon LI Hung Chang,
the Minister says, the Dowager Em
press has long admired the rugged
ability of the old statesman. But he
did not think this would result in the
return of Li to the Foreign Office,
from which post he was recently re
lieved, owing, it was understood, to
foreign influences. It is probable, the
Minister says, that Prince Li will con
tinue in his nominal post as Imperial
Secretary.
When asked if China had the
strength to resist dismemberment by
foreign powers, Mr. Wu Tong Fang
said:
"I am confident China will remain in
tact and I am glad to note that your
Minister in China, Mr. Denby, has the
same opinion."
The Minister speaks with especial
satisfaction of the concession which he
signed a short time ago, by which an
American syndicate will build the rail
road from Hankow to Canton a dis
tance of 800 miles. It is understood
that among the names of those inter
ested in the concession are the Rocke
fellers, Vanderbilts, Morgans, Brice
and ex-Mayor Hugh Grant of New
York.
CRIMINAL AGGRESSION,
SAYS SCHURMAN
ITHACA, N. T.. Sept. 23.-Prosident
Bchurman, in his annual address to the
students of Cornell University yesterday,
touched upon the issue brought up by
the recent war with Spain, relative to the
disposal of acquired territory, including
the Philippines. He said:
"We hear it advocated that the Philip
pines belong to us by right of conquest.
But the idea that we have conquered
them is a mistaken one. We have taken
Manila, but there yet remain 15,000 in
surgents under the control of a fierce and
desperate leader. We are, therefore, un
der no obligation to its people.

of territory, but democracy, which is

SANTIAGO DE CTTBA, Sept. 23.â A

culated among revolutionary societies
of the eastern part of the island in ref
erence to the present relations of the
United States and Cuba, It is un
signed, but the fact that it is circulated
and that the circulation is authorized
by Cuban officials and that its senti
ments are those expressed by the most
violent of the Cuban party adds 'nuch
importance to the document. It is
couched in the strongest language, and
its tone throughout is hostile to the
United States. The veiled sentiment
running through it is that there shall
be no further intervention by America
save what is necessary to establish
Cuba as a republic. No further inter
ference is to be brooked and it will be
resisted to any extremity.
The document begins by stating the
broad principle that no will should be
recognized in Cuba save the will of her
own people, which must be supreme
and absolute. No form of government
will be acceptable save that of a re
public, with the most perfect Independ

MANILA, Aug. 13.â The battle is
won and Manila has been delivered into
American hands. Writing by electric
light in the Governor General's country
palace at Malakanau, with the swift
Pasig flowing silently by, it is difficult
to realize that what has been done was
done so quickly. For weeks the Ameri
cans have lain in the trenches before
MaJate, soaked with the torrential rain
of the tropics, shivering from fever
when the hot sun shone, watching the
electric lights of the Meet before Cavite
play up and down the beach by night,
fearful of nothing as an army, each
man realizing that one chance exposure
of his head above the line of intrench
ments would lead to death at the
hands of a Spanish sharpshooter, a
hoping against hope, day by day, for
the signal to be given for the advance.
It has been a weary waiting crowned
with glorious success. And while the
men waited the wise heads to whose
subtle brains had been entrusted the
conduct of operations planned a coup
which would deliver Manila into our
hands with the smallest possible loss
of life. It is difficult to say, In the
light of events, that the city was given
up as the result of an agreed plan, per
mitting Governor Jaudenes to make
just enough resistance to save his own
head under Spain's peculiar military
law. If the plan was made the Ameri
can soldiers knew nothing about it, nor
did the Spanish. They fought as men
fight who believe their quarrel just,
fiercely and to the death. Let it never
be said after the fall of Manila that
the Spanish soldier is not brave, al
though it can be said with truth that
he is badly led.
Last night the order came to Camp
Dewey that the attack would be de
livered this morning. The wild cheers
that broke from the throats of ten
thousand men as the news traveled
down the line was a sufficient demon
stration of the joy coming when the
long suspense was over. The boys in
camp .polished their rifles, jested and
sang and sank to sleep after taps
calmly and peacefully as though the
morrow would not dawn a day of bat
tle. If there was the slightest sign of
nervousness in the camp of the Cali
fornians, the gallant First, with whom
I made my home, I did not see it. Cer
tainly there was not an additional man
at sick call on the eventful morningâ
and many who were sick, as well as
even the cooks from the camp kitchens,
seized their guns despite camp duty
and the doctors and inarched to the
front with the rest. The Californians
only grumbled and as they thought
with justice when the word came that
they were to lead the reserve instead
of being on the firing line â but present
ly Colonel Smith, coming from the
headquarters of General Anderson,
said /he had been assured the First
would b* first into Manila and so made
light the hearts inclined theretofore to
rebellion.
â¢ The troops for the land attack were
disposed as follows: General Greene
had, on the left wing, extending from
the beach to the Pardy road, the First
Colorado, the Fourteenth regulars and
the Twenty-third regulars on his firing
line. The reserve was half a mile
back and consisted of the First Califor
nia, First Nebraska and Tenth Penn
sylvania in the order named, tike Penn
sylvanlans having held the wenches
last night and consequently not being
expected to come into action except as
a last resort. Battery A of the Utah
Artillery, with four guns, held the en
trenchments.
The right wing, under General Mc-
Arthur, had its line extending from the
Calle Real, otherwise known as the Pa
say road, to the entrenchments oppo
site the Spanish blockhouse at Paco
and the Santa Ana trenches. Battery
B of the Utah Artillery held the old
trenches above the Pasay road with
four guns. The Thirteenth Minnesota,
the Eighteenth regulars and the Third
Regular Artillery, acting as infantry,
were on the firing line, and the Astor
Battery, on high ground, commanded
the Paco blockhouse, where was housed
a rapid-fire gun which was expected to
do great havoc. The Dakota and Wy
oming troops formed the reserve of the
right wing.
The troops had been ordered to eet
under way at 6 a. m., to be in position
at 9 o'clock, when the battle would be
gin. The fleet would begin moving
long before that hour.
The day broke cloudy, with spits of
rain now and again sweeping over the
bay and almost hiding the ships from
the shore. At a little before 9 a. m.
the Charleston, which had been keep
ing coast guard over Camp Dewey, was
seen from the shore to be moving over
to join the fleet. Then I saw the Mon
terey slowly detach herself from the
slowly circling vessels and steam to
ward a position where her great guns
could batter the famous walled town
down about the ears of its garrison
and of the thousands who had sought
shelter within its gates. Slowly, as
the mist rose and fell, I could seÂ« the
admiral's line forming. The Monterey
still led. The Concord, far on the
left, had the Boston next in line, and
then there was the Charleston, the
Baltimore lying a little back, the noble
Olympia, the Raleigh, the Petrel and
close in to the shore the captured gun
boat Callao, bristling with rapid-fire
guns. As the ships came on, the Mon
terey like some grim black monster of
the deep, crept closer and closer to
ward the walled tow- her guns silent,
and no sound coming from the doomed
city, whose roofs, I could see, were
black with people watching the ap
proaching fleet.
In the meantime, in camp the
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
troops had begun to move out short
ly after daylight, the First Colorado
leading, with the band playing national
airs. The band of the First California
goes to the front, also, but it goes- as a
fighting band, fully armed, which is an
other kind of tale of war. The Call
fornians cheered the Coloradoans as
they passed through our cai-p, though
the hearts of the boys were heavy
within them. Then the call to arma
sounded. Father MrKinnon, brave
man and good, blessed the colors in
touching words and granted general
absolution to those who had thought
less of their own souls than of the
slaughter of their fellows. Thus, fol
lowed by prayer, strong In the con
sciousness of a rierhteous cause, the
First California marched away to bat
tle. They would be in the reserve; but
their good colonel, beloved of all his
men, had promised they would be first
into Manila, and they trusted him.
The troops, even those of General Me-
Arthur on the extreme right, were all
in place by 9 o'clock. It was 9:35 a. m.
when a 4-inch shell, screaming from the
side of the Olympia and falling short
of Fort San Antonio Abad, at Malate,
gave the signal for the opening of the
battle. The California boys, behind
the line of mango trees and bamboo
fringing the beach, could hear the
shots. They could not see the results
and their blood tingled with the ex
citement of it and the uncertainty.
The Olympia fired again and again and
the battie was open all along the line.
The Utah gunners, noble fellows, sent
shot after shot screaming into the fort
and the Malate pulverin (or powder
magazine), and how fatally well they
shot we saw when we had gained the
fort. The Colorado men on the firing
line worked like beavers, too, and far
on the right the Eighteenth and the
Third Artillery were sustaining a heavy
fire from the Spaniards strongly en
trenched, while the Astor Battery boys,
although two of them were killed while
serving a piece, they would :iot desert,
finding their guns working badly and
that the Spanish hornet in the Paco
blockhouse had a thousand stings,
stormed and carried the place with
their revolvers, setting it on fire. The
days when that rapido could sweep the
Calle Real to the American camp were
no more.
The fleet, while the boys on shore
worked so heroically, was not idle. The
Petrel and the Raleigh took up the
chorus from the Olympia, but their
shells fell, for the most part, short of
the Malate fort. It seemed to me,
watching from the beach, as to the
men on The Call-Herald launch out in
the fleet, that the bombardment was to
be all a bluffâ that the tale of the loss
of Manila to Spain was a story already
told.
Then the little Callao, steaming
ahead and close in, changed the scene.
With her rapid fire guns she poured
into the Spanish fort such streams of
murderous shot as made the place ab
solutely untenable. The little launch
Barcelo, tender to the Olympia, manned
by four sailors and carrying one ma
chine gun, dashed ahead of the Callao,
and, like an impudent wasp, went with
in pistol shot of the shore to deliver
her fire.
All this time, though the Spanish
riflemen fought fiercely and even sent
a few shots in the direction of the Cal
lao and the Barcelo, doing no harm,
there was no heavy gun within the
Spanish lines that fired a shot. The
great battery on the Luneta, about
which we have heard so much, the
heavy guns of the walled citadel, even
the guns mounted at San Antonio
Abad, were grimly silent.
All this time, out in the bay, the
showers were going and coming on the
southwest monsoon, now making thÂ«
ships invisible, now 1.-tting us see from
the beach the whole superb panorama.
In one short half-hour after the bom
bardment had begun, if that can be
called a bombardment which was only
a shelling of the Malate trenches and
in which not a great shell had been
fired into the populous city, General
Greene saw that the time had come to
advance. He gave the nod, and the
Colorado boys and the regulars leaped
over the trenches, meeting a scattering
fire from Spanish sharpshooters hidden
in rifle pits 300 yards in frcnt. They
swept over these and on into Fort San
Antonio Abad without loss of life, and
Lieutenant Colonel McCoy pulled down
the Spanish flag and hoisted the stars
and stripes. The works which had an.
noyed our lines so long had been won,
and now it was the day of the Califor
nians.
The Colorado troops had advanced
into Malate, headed by their band play
ins "There'll Be a Hot Time in the Old
Town to-night." The Signal Corps, un
der Major Thompson, had followed the
Colorado men. but the Californians. led
by Colonel Smith, swept over him down
the beach, across a slough, where the
water came up to our waists and
where my boots were filled with sand,
into the fort, where the Colorado men
a detachment of the regulars rested
"for a moment. That moment was
enough to give the Californians the
lead. They passed San Antonio Abad
and entered the cable station, a house
beside the Calle Real with an arch
running clear through it. In the fort
behind them a Colorado man had been
killed as our boys passed. Major
Sime of the Second Battalion, stepping
out in the road, became a target at once
for Spaniards who had barricaded the
Calle Real. He stepped back for a
moment. Cool and collected. Colonel
Smith, going over a fence in the rear
of the house, gained the street. "Come
on, boys." he said. Major Slme had
won the road also, and they sent Com
panies L and B across the street, where
the men would be out of the line of fire,
in detachments. It was the -only way
In which the FtrOft could have been
won. I was with the boys and I saw It
done. From the houses all about us
came the sharp sput! sput! of the
Mauser.
General Merritt. conducting the bat
tle from the Zaflro with the color com
pany of the Oregon Volunteers witfc2
him, had close at hand the Nan Shoan,
with the balance of two battalions of
Oregon troops from Cavite on board to
form a landing party. The fleet had
ceased firing when the advance of the
troops began.
It was the fortunes of war and not
superior bravery where all were brave
that led I Company of the gallant Cali
fornians to get ahead of Company B.
The boys followed Colonel Smith and
Major Sinie down the street, fighting
every inch of the way, until the barri
cade* had been passed. The balance of
the Californians .and the regulars were
cominur fast, but not quite rapidly
enough. The lads of "B" were brave.
The lads of "I" were not to be denied.
With not lees .nan 2500 Spaniards con
cealed in the houses of Malate and
Hermita they fought their way down
through those suburbs and were under
the guns of the walled city, at the
mercy of merciless foes, as it seemed,
before they saw the white flag waving
from the southwest corner of the city
walls. I know the peril of that cross
ing of the wide open space forming the
breathing ground of this capital for,
crossing with ...e boys, I myself heard
the sharp singini; of Mauser bullets,
fired from behind me, about my ears.
It is a sound that once heard I do not
believe will be ever forgotten. A kind
of small shrill screaming as of a wasp
tangled in a snare. General Greene
and his staff rode across the Lunetk
after the coming of the Californians
and were also under the fire of the
Spaniards concealed in the houses be
hind them. Perhaps their passions were
too thoroughly aroused to permit them
to see the sign of surrender on old Ma
nila. Perhaps it was Spanish treachery
to hoist the white fla.g to lure the foe
to death. At all events, with armed
men in thousands behind them and the
walls of the old city bristling with
other thousands of riflemen, while be
yond the first went an advanced line
of infantry crouched back of temporary
earthworks, certainly the lives of that
little band of Americans who had
fought their way through all obstacles,
the spots of blood staining the stones
of the CaJle Real, showing how deadly
had been their fire, nor of their com
manding general were worth a mo
ment's purchase.
General Greene and his staff rode out
across the Luneta to where the white
flag waved, at the outermost corner of
the walled city, and after a brief par
ley with the official at the gate near
the seaside was directed to the gate
farther west, before which the Cali
fornians, now joined by Companies D
and H, the balance of the battalion,
and by some of the regulars, had
halted.
It was at this moment 2000 Spanish
troops, driven into Hermita from Santa
Ana way by the advancing line of Gen
eral McArthur, were fired upon by some
insurgent devils who had managed
somehow to sneak in between McAr
thur's men and the city. It looked, for
a moment as though the signal for
massacre had come. The Spaniards
on the walls prepared to flre, and the
Americans, caught between the lines
of fire, threw themselves down, seek
ing what cover the''- could. Colonel
Smith, Major time, the Spanish officers,
exerted themselves to stay the fatal
struggle. Two Americans had already
been shot when the insurgents were
stopped and the crisis had passed. Gen
eral Greene came up, the balance of
the left wing moved through Malate
and Hermita still galled by the sharp
shooters, and the two sides halted for
a breathing space. The First Battal
ion of the Californlans had come up
and, still leading his men of the Sec
ond Battalion, Colonel Smith rode
down the long road, sweeping In a
curve about the walled city, which
forms a part of the pleasure drive of
Manila, and took possession of the sus
pension bridge leading into the south
western suburbs, and of the stone
bridge known as the Puente Espano,
which leads from the walled town into
the Escoka, the main business street,
and Binonda, the shipping district. The
appearance of the American troops
here seemed to set the people of the
city wild. They did not know the
town had fallen, and they would not
believe at first that these brawny,
brown-clad, bearded men, sinewy as
lions and lithe as panthers, were the '
troops of the nation they had been
taught to despise. Riding across the
Puente Espaiio and down into the Es
colta, I was the first American to en
ter the business heart of Manila, and
though the people who jammed the
narrow street fell back in front of me
as I rode, I could see from the scowl-
Ing faces that the position was not a
safe one, even with the white flag fly-
Ing. From our position on the bridge,
indeed, the white flag was not visible.
Only the yellow standard of Spain
floated from the flag staff in the cita
del, as it had floated every day for a
hundred years.
That flag was soon to come down,
never, let it be hoped, to Â».y there
again. General Merritt, from the Za
firo, had seen the white Hag and sent
Adjutant General Whittier, accom
panied by Lieutenant Brundy of the
flagship, ashore to arrange the terms
of the capitulation. Close behind the
launch which brought the ofliciaij came
the Call-Herald launch with represen
tatives of those newspapers on board â
the first newspaper men to land in the
walled city. There was some little
trouble experienced in finding Governor
General Jaudenes Alvarez, although
he was finally discovered concealed in
the sacristy of a church where a num
ber of women and children had taken
refuge and then he was greatly alarmed
at learning that fighting was still in
progress to the southwest of the city.
The Spaniards who held the trenches
there had not heard of the white flag,
and from their distant station could
not see it. They had fought, therefore,
as well as they knew how and were
Btill fighting. Perhaps they were doing
their duty as they thought better than
some persons. In Manila of higher au
thority. The Governor General was at
last prevailed upon to treat, and the
terms of capitulation as finally agreed
upon were in substance as follows:
The surrender of the Philippine Is
lands. Officers to be allowed to retain
their swords and personal effects, but
not their horses.
During their stay in Manila the offi
cers to be considered on parole, but
strictly speaking they are not paroled
owing to some peculiarity of the Span
ish military regulations.
The troops to be prisoners of war,
surrendering their arms at a depot ap
pointed by General Merritt.
All necessary supplies to be provided
from the public treasury and when the
funds are exhausted the United States
to provide for the maintenance of the
troops.
All public property to be surrendered
The future disposition of the troops
to be left for negotiation between the
United States and the Spanish Govern
ments.
Arms to be returned to the troops at
General Merritt's discretion.
All banks and similar institutions to
continue to operate under existing
regulations, t, bject to any changes
that may be made by the United States
There remained for the Americans
only the task of taking formal posses
sion of that which they had won with
such surprising ease. Leaving the
room in the Governor's palace where
the negotiations had been conducted
General Whittier, Lieutenant Brundy
of the Olympia and Lieutenant Povey
of the First Oregon, which regiment
had by this time been landed in the
walled city, walked rapidly down to the
staff from which the colors of Spain
still floated. The task was a short one.
Lieutenant Povey of the Oregons
dragged the Spanish colors down. Lieu
tenant Brundy of the navy brought out
the Stars and Stripes.

Individual Acts of Bravery During

BY PRIVATE Â£RED A. HEALY.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
MANILA, Aug. 28.â As the news of
peace has been received the boys of the
Second Battalion have come to the con
clusion that they are in for a long
term of garrison duty, and as they
wish to get as much fun out of life as
possible, and as there is plenty of ma
terial among the rank and file of the
battalion to supply any amount of good
clean fun, they have decided to utilize
it and give entertainments every two
weeks or so both for their own amuse
ment and for the sake of showing these
people down here that the American
soldier can be just as pleasant a com
panion in time of peace as he can be
terrible in time of war.
Last evening (Saturday) the initial
one of this contemplated series of hos
pitalities occurred. It took the form of
a literary and musical entertainment,
and though it had been got up in
a hurry, and was in fact an impromptu
a.Tair, it met with unqualified suc
cess, and when at last it was over
every fellow who attended It went to
his bed like Oliver Twist, with a keen
desire for more. All of the talent that
participated came from the rank and
file. The speeches, two in number, were
delivered by Colonel Smith and Major
Sime.
The affair was held In what In ante
bellum days had been the residence of
a princely Chinese merchant of Manila.
The house is a two-storied structure
with a court yard and a fountain In the
middle, around which are built the
suites of sleeping apartments, din
ing rooms, parlors, billiard and card
roomÃ, etc. Two companies of the bat
talion are quartered on the lower floor,
while the upper floor is used by the offi
cers of the battalion as their own quar
ters.
I am at loss to glv- you a description
that will really picture to your mind's
eye the sort of a place Manila really
is. But if you can imagine an amalga
mation of Chinatown and Barbary
Coast and then people such a delight
ful district with lazy and dishonest
Spaniards, treacherous Filipinos and
diseased Chinamen, you will come
pretty near describing: the place we
have been fighting for two months to
get into.
As to the people. The Spaniards are,
as a rule, fine-looking men in a coarse,
bloated sort of a way. They are very
polite, but the cruelty that lurks in the
corners of their dark eyes does much
to dispel the effect produced by theli
soft speech, and goes a long way to
ward confirming the tales we have
been told of their inhuman treatment of
those who were unfortunate enough to
first incur their enmity and then fall
under their power. The few Spanish
women are poor, pallid scurvy-looking
creatures and not to be mentioned in
the same breath with our own lovely
girls at home. As for the natives, they
are about the nearest thing to the brute
creation that humanity has to be
ashamed of, and are not worth as much
serious consideration as an Arizona set
tler would give to a drunken Apache.
The streets here would be alleys in
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1898.
any other country, and the boasted
Escolta, the center of the fashionable
shopping and parade district, is dis
tanced by a cheap grocery and retail
district in any out of the way place in
America.
The residences of some of the swells
are really fine places, but nothing to
what we have at home, and the only
thing palatial about them is the con
trast they exhibit to their surroundings.
The roads and drives are fairly pretty
and very dusty in dry weather. In wet
weather one cannot see the road with
out the help of a diving-bell. Alto
gether it is a nice place. It has one
brewery, which starts up every morn-
Ing and is promptly drunk to a state of
absolute dryness by about 4 o'clock
every afternoon by the crowd of beer
loving barbarians from America, whose
taste for the amber-colored beverage
has sent the price per keg up from $3
to $3 50.
The aftermath of the battle is still
the one topic of conversation in town,
and the volunteer troops are receiving
compliments on all Bides for the splen
did gallantry of their advance. As the
First California led the army it natur
ally comes in for the lion's share of
praise, and the Second Battalion under
the command of brave old Major Sime
is the distinguished section of the regi
ment. I am sorry to see that among
the different companies comprising the
Second Battalion there has arisen a
spirit of jealously which, if it is allowed
to continue, will have considerable to
do with destroying the esprit de corps
which a regiment should possess. Com
pany L under command of Captain Eg
gert and led by that gentlemen, Lieu
tenant Curzons a id Lieutenant Adler,
was the first to reach the walls of Ma
nila and witness the surrender, beating
every other company by over ten min
utes. Instead of congratulating Com
pany L on its distinction and giving it
the praise its gallant conduct entitles
It to, the other companies try to steal
its laurels by claiming to have won
them themselves, thus causing consid
erable argument and ill-feeling where
all should be in harmony and perfect
accord. Fortunately Company L's po
sition in the fight was so well deter
mined that there cannot be the slight
est question of who was really in at the
finish.
I understand that three men in Com
pany L are to be mentioned for dis
tinguished gallantry, namely Privates
Moltke, Clancy and Brown. Moltke,
when the insurgents came following
the retreating Spaniards up to the
walls firing into them and attempting
to start what promised to be a general
massacre, took a white handkerchief
from around his neck, and unheeding
the storm of bullets that rained down
about him from the walls behind and
sang and whistled up the street In
front where the savage Filipinos were
slaughtering the foe that had surren
dered, held it aloft in his hand and ad
vanced down through the retreating
Spaniards until he met the insurgents
face to face, where he halted and kept
them until their officers could get them
under control. It was a gallant dis
play of bravery and great presence of
mind, and entitles Private Carl Moltke
to every honor a grateful Government
can bestow upon him. What Clancy
and Brown did which should entitle
them to any honor not shared by every
one of their comrades I cannot ascer
tain, though I have made most diligent
inquiries in my endeavor to learn.
Though there were many officers
whose conduct on the day of days en
titles them to praise, yet there Is one
man whose splendid courage, excellent
Judgement, steadfast perseverance and
unwavering determination entitle him
to the very first honors ol the whole
army and who is already beginning to
receive the reward of his gallantry in
the respect and esteem he' is held In by
the non-combatant residents and the
regular army and navy officers sta
tioned here, both aboard our own ships
and on those of the foreign nations now
stationed here. That man is Major
Hugh T. Sime, commanding the Second
Battalion, who personally led the whole
army to success and was the first offi
cer or man to reach, the goal. Let this
be published if you cut all else of my
stuff, for in doing so, you will only be
doing justice to a man whose bravery
is splendid enough to stand out before
the best, but whose modesty would
never allow it to be known were it not
witnessed and commented upon by
others.
Colonel Smith I did not see much of,
but the boys who did see him say he
is an officer fitted to lead a body of
troops right into hell, and that they
would follow him there in a minute.
This I do know, that if I am any judge
of a man our colonel has yet lo learn
the meaning of fear and he loves a
scrap from a pure, unalloyed soldierly
Jove of fighting for fighting's sake.

SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Sept. 23.â T0
the residents of Santiago yesterday was
the most important day since the ca
pitulation, since it was the occasion of
the first visit of General Calixto Garcia
to Santiago since he left there in a bad
temper cm July 17. At 9 o'clock in the
morning General Wood, with a portion
of General Lawton's staff and several
American officers, met General Garcia
outside the city limits and escorted him
into the town.
Garcia was accompanied by his staff
and by his son, Colonel Calixto Garcia,
by many Cuban officers who have re
cently come to Santiago and by 200 Cu
ban cavalry. The streets through which
the party passed were thronged with
cheering people and it was estimated
that 10,000 persons filled the plaza In
front of the palace, where Garcia dis
mounted. He was met at the door by
General Lawton and an informal recep
tion by the American officers was held
in the audience room. At night another
reception was tendered General Garcia
at the San Carlos Club, which was
filled with prominent Cubans, American
officers and ladies. The plaza was bril
liantly lighted and decorated with nagÃ
and music was furnished by the band of
the Fifth Infantry. The Americans
wore dress uniforms and General Gar
cia and his officers wore white uni
forms and high boots.
In reply to a speech of welcome deliv
ered by Senor Trujlllo, editor of the
Porvenir, General Garcia said:
"After thirty years of desperate,
deadly struggle the Cuban people to
day celebrate the success of their ef
forts. It is a day for the remembrance
of the names and deeds of thOÃe heroes
who fought and died for the freedom
of Cuba from the year of 1868 to 1878,
and for the remembrance of the heroes
who fought in the war of 1881, which
was called the 'little war'â little only
because of its short duration, but great
on account of the principles defended
and for the quality of the men who
composed the army â find for the re
membrance of those noble soldiers who
fell in the struggle which began in 1895,
over whose graves our latest tears have
fallen.
"People of Cuba, we owe a great debt
to those heroes for their efforts In be
half of Cuban independence, efforts
which would have been useless â no, not
useless, for we would have triumphed,
but not speedily effective â if the Amer
ican peof>le\ wftn its famous fighters,
great ships and dauntless army, had
not sent its own sons to shed their
blood with ours. A grand nation it
must be when the sons of America, who
had nothing to gain in Cuba but a sol
dier's glory, should come here to die
side by side with Cubans. To this great
nation â to this noble country which has
always fought for the rights of liberty â
we owe the achievement of our inde-
pendence and the consummation of our
ideals. Our gratitude will long live for
America."
General Garcla's speech, which was
delivered with considerable expression,
aroused much enthusiasm among the
Cubans present. General Garcia will
remain in Santiago for several days as
the guest of the Cubans of this city.
CRASHED UPON A
SUBMERGED ROCK
The Barbara Boscowitz
Wrecked.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C., Sept. 23.â The
steamship Barbara Boscowitz was
driven upon a rock four miie3 above
Kitkatlah at noon on Friday last while
bound northward. Her crew arrived
here this morning on the Princess
Louise, When they left the Boscowitz
was lying on her side with water
sweeping through her, and was llkaly
to become a total loss. At high tide
she was all but covered, only the upper
works being visible.
Kitkatlah la an Indian fishing village
south of Goshen Islands. The weather
was clear and calm, but the swift cur
rent baffled all attempts to steer the
vessel, and she crashed upon a sub
merged rock. The rock shows at low
tide. Most of the passengers were be
low at luncheon.
An attempt was made to back the
vessel, but it was unavailing. The coal
and the cargo were shifted to the after
part of the vessel, the passengers aid
ing the crew. Then the boat arose
some, but still was fast on the jagged
rocks. Then the current swung the
stertr round closer to the rocks, which
impaled her bow, and with the falling
of the tide she gradually rolled over on
her starboard side.
Surveyor Wilkinson, his wife and a
nurse were among the passengers.
They lowered their boat and
rowed to Kitkatkah and sent In
dians to rescue the others. A large fleet
of sloops, canoes and skiffs put out,
towing a scow to receive freight from
the doomed vessel. The passengers
were taken off and all the freight un
loaded.
Then the vessel keeled over. Several
on board had narrow escapes, some
Jumping from the deck on to the scow,
and others below making their way out
of the portholes. In the fall the
steamer almost wrecked the scow. The
freight and passengers were landed at
Kitkatlah.
Captain Steele does not expect to get
the vessel off. She is too badly dam
aged, and will likely prove a total loss.
The Boscowitz was built here in 1883.
She was 120 feet long, 22 feet beam and
10 fret hold. She is owned by Captain
Warren and has been a money-maker
ever since she has been in the service.
Captain Steele and all her officers are
spoken well of, and are regarded as
careful navigators.

WASHINGTON, Sept. 23.â 1t Is prob
able that if Agoncillo and Lopez, the
two representatives of Aguinaldo, who
arrived yesterday at San Francisco call
at the White House on their way
through Washington to Paris, they will
be admitted to see President McKinley,
but only as individuals and not as rep
resentatives of any Government. The
President, doubtless, would be glad to
hear anv views these Filipinos might
care to set forth, being fresh from the
islands and thoroughly acquainted with
the wishes of the insurgents. But it
would be plainly impolitic and incon
sistent for the Persident at this date
and pending the conclusion of the peace
conference at Paris, to allow it to be
understood, by according a formal re
ception to the delegates that he had
thereby recognized the Philippine Gov
ernment as an independent nationality.
His attitude toward the Filipinos would
be similar to that assumed by him tow
ard the Cubans.
As the Filipinos have repeatedly, by
public declaration sought to convey the
impression that the United States rep
resentatives in Manila have at some
time during the progress of the war
recognized Aguinaldo as an independ
ent ally and entered into formal co
operation with him, it may be stated
that the Government at Washington is
unaware that any such thing has hap
pened. .Admiral Dewey, who was in
command of all the United States
forces during the most critical period,
expresÃly cabled the Secretary of the
Navy that he had entered into no for
mal agreement with Aguinaldo. If Gen
eral Otis followed his instructions, and
of that there can be no doubt, he also
refrained from entering into any en
tangling agreements. As for Consul-
General Wildman, any undertaking he
may have assumed with Aguinaldo
must have been upon his own personal
and Individual responsibility, and
would be without formal standing in
asmuch as he has not the express au
thorization from the State Department
absolutely requisite to negotiations in
such cases. Therefore, as the case now
stands, the Peace Commissioners are
free to deal with the Philippine prob
lem at Paris absolutely without re
straint beyond that which might be
supposed to rise from a sense of moral
obligation to avoid committing the
Philippines again into the hands of
their late rulers.
TO SWEAR AWAY
A MAN'S HONOR
Santa Barbara Lawyer
Accused.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA BARBARA, Sept. 23.â Late
this afternoon Justice of the Pea-ce W.
C. Gammil issued a warrant for the
arrest of C. A. Armstrong, a prominent
attorney of Santa Maria. The arrest
grew out of an alleged attempt on the
part of Armstrong to induce Flossie
Stanley, a woman of loose character, to
give false testimony in the divorce case
of Helen E. Cook against R. D. Cook.
Armstrong Is the attorney for the
plaintiff and Caleb Sherman the coun
sel for defendant. Desertion, cruelty
and adultery were charged and in at
tempting to establish the latter charge
the plaintiff attempted to prove by the
Stanley woman that the defendant had
Improper relations with her.
On the stand she testified that it was
false and on cross-examination swore
that C. A. Armstrong, who had caused
her to be subpenaed as a witness for
the plaintiff, sent for her to come to
his office and there offered her $25 if
she would testify that she had had im
proper relations with Cook.
The charge against Armstrong Is a
very serious one, the crime being a
felony. The defendant, Cook, is a high
ly respected citizen of Santa Maria. He
is one of the owners of the land that
the town of Santa Maria Is built on.
The divorce case has been a sensational
affair, and it has occupied the atten
tion of th court for a considerable time.

Title of an Addition to

Hawaiia to Probably Be Given the
Widest Kind of Self-Bule
by the Adminis
tration.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Sept. 23.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs;
Secretary of the Colonies will doubtless
be the title of the next addition to the
Cabinet of the President. There is
little doubt that It will become neces
sary for Congress to enact legislation
providing for a department of the col
onies.
When Congress is called upon to de
termine the character of the govern
ments to be given to the colonies it
is said that the English example will
be closely studied, and much of the
legislation enacted will be based on
English precedents. It is realized by
those who have given thought to th*
subject that widely different forms of
government may have to be instituted
for the different possessions that have
come to us, differing probably as wide
lv &S the Government of Canaia and
that of Hongkong in the English colo
nial system. Thus, if Hawaii is to be
governed as a colony, it will be given
at ence the widest kind of self-govern
ment, the control of the United States
>>:ing probably limited to the apoo'nt.
rr.tnt of a Governor by the President,
nnd the reservation of the right to veto
any legislation that may be enacted by
the Legislature.
It will probably be some time beiore
any of the possessions taken from
Spain will be capable of such a degree
of self-government as this, and it is
thought that different systems could be
applied with advantage to Porto Rico,
the Philippines and Cuba, for it is gen
erally assumed here that the Cubans
cannot establish a stable independent
government and that a good govern
ment for the island can only be guar
anteed by its retention under the sov
ereignty of the United States. There
will be many questions to be deefded
by Congress as to the extent to which
colonies shall be allowed to manage
their own affairs, and as to the extent
to which the Government of the United
States shall have direct charge of mat
ters. As long as they remain under
military control the War Department
will have entire charge of every de
partment of their governmental ma
chinery, Including military affairs,
finances, postal services and everything
else, but this will be changed more or
less when permanent systems are de
vised.
Great Britain's example may also be
followed in having native troops in
Cuba, Porto Rico and the Philippines
under command of American officers.
RECRUITING ENDED

VALLEJO, Sept. 23.â A telegram was
received at Mare Island to-day from Com
modore A, S. Crowninshield, Chief of the
Bureau of Navigation at the Navy De
partment, to "discontinue Asiatic detail."
This order will stop the enlistment of men
required for Admiral Dewey's ships at
Manila. It is believed by officers at Mare
Island that the men required by vessels
at Manila will be sent thither on the Ore
gon, the lowa and the colliers and ten
ders that accompany them from the At

of transportation that would be caused by
men going from Mare Island. The men
already shipped on the Independence w.il

ENTOMBED IN
A COAL MINE
Two Explosioos in Which Eigh
Delvers Meet a Terrible
Death.
An)fd Scenes of Awful Suspense trje Re
n)aining Workers Are Finally
Rescued.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BROWNSVILLE, Pa., Sept. 23.â
Seventy men were entombed to-day in
the Empire mine of Snowden, Gould &
Co., one-fourth of a mile below town,
as the result of an explosion of gas,
followed by another explosion of fire
damp. Of the number entombed all
escaped or were taken out by rescuing
parties except eight, who were killed
outright and three more or less hurt.
The dead:
John Haiston, mineT, aged 35, colored;
wife and two children.
Salem Haiston, miner; his brother.
Robert Davidson, miner.
John Bennett, driver.
: William Pritchard, miner. ,
Henry Hagar, driver.
' John Cartwright, miner.
James Hill, miner.
The injured: George Baker, miner;
John Baker, slightly burned; Samuel
Mclntyre, cut on head.
The explosion Is said to have been
â caused by the loosening of a large
block of coal which opened a pocket of
gas. Immediately following the explo
sion of gas there was a second ex
plosion of fire damp. There were
seventy men at work in the mine at
the time of the disaster and at first it
seemed an impossibility for any of the
fifty-four men in mines No. 9 and 10,
where the explosion occurred, to es
cape. Four men. Jacobs, Davis, Whesa
Â£.nd Walker, who were near the en
trance, managed to crawl out and the
others, with the exception of those
caught by falling coal, escaped by
traversing a mile and a half of under
ground passages, coming out at the
entrance near Lynn station. This point
is four miles from the opening of the
mine.
It Is difficult to find wordÃ to describe
the scenes of to-day. Shortly after
the report was circulated that an ex
plosion had taken place at the Empire
mine and that many miners were en
tombed. Water street, a narrow
thoroughfare leading to it, was crowded
â with men, women andy children, all
moving at break-neck speed toward
the mines. There were moans and sobs
and a general feeling of painful ap
prehension. There were conjectures of
whether husband, father, brother or
sweetheart were victims. When the
mine was reached willing hands at once
went to work. Everybody seemed to
want to go into the mine. It was by
vhÂ«4r Coree thax those In charge at the
entrance kept the crowd out. It was

Special Dispatch to Tho Call.
KINGSTON, Jamaica. Sept. 23.â Ma1l
advices which reached here to-day
brought news regarding the full ex
tent of the hurricane disaster at the
Islands of St. Vincent, St. Lucia and
Barbadoes, showing that the first ac
counts were not exaggerated. At St.
Vincent about 300 lives have been lost,
not counting the loss of life suffered
through the destruction of shipping.
The coast la strewn with the wrecks
of vessels, many of which were from
BarbadoÂ«s.
The storm raged from 10 o clock In
the morning, Sunday, September 11, un
til 2 o'clock in the afternoon, completely
wrecking the island. At the capital,
Kingston, fully 200 houses were demol- ,
ished, while the suburbs, Coxheath and
Monte Bello, were obliterated. Among !
the principal buildings destroyed are ,
the Anglican and Catholic â¢hurches, the
line new hospital and Fort Charlotte.
All the other public buildings were
more or less injured.
Cloudbursts from the mountains
ewept much of the ruins Into the sea,
as well as several dead and Injured |
arsons.
Throughout the island the destruction
9as on a wholesale scale, not only the
States .and buildings being razed, but
Cultivation being obliterated.
The following towns and villages were
destroyed: Rose Place, Grand Sable,
ArnoÃvale, Mount PU-asant, Argyll.
Wallilabo, Barrouallio, Lay on and Buc
cament, and the second city, George
town, was considerably damaged.
No approximate estimate of the pe
cuniary damage done has been reported,
but the island is practically ruined.
8t Lucia suffered mostly from rain \
and landslides, the deluge lasting ten j
hours. Cul de Sac and Rousseau val- i
leys the centers of the cane and cocoa- J
nut' trade, vere converted into lakes
and partly filled with debris from the
mountains, which ruined the crops,
while many plantations elsewhere were
wrecked. Serious damage was sus
tained at Mormetabo, which precipi
tated an avalanche three miles long,
covering the valley to the width of a
mile and over, covering Ruby and a
couple of other islands. Several other ,
elides partly destroyed the Dramond
and San Jacques plantations. The city :
of Castries suffered somewhat, chiefly j
from a tidal wave which swept over
half the town and wrecked a portion of I
announced that there was a sufficient
force of men inside to do rescue work,
when a weary and painful wait of
hours took place.
Just above the entrance to the mine
there is an artificial plateau up against
the hillside. From the edge of the pla
teau a good view of the track leading
to the mine could be had. Here women
stood wringing their hands in anguish,
weeping and wailing. The hundreds of
people realized that they stood at the
entrance of a living tomb. It was sev
eral hours later that the tinkling of
the electric bell in the engine house an
nounced that a train of coal cars was
coming from within. The scene of the
disaster is more than a mile from the
entrance. The cars were taken in and
out by means of heavy iron cables
wrapped and unwrapped by two large
spools. It took about ten minutes for
the first load to reach the outside
world. While the cable was winding
the suspense bordered on the awful. No
one knew what was coming, but feared
the worst, in which there was no dis
appointment. As one of the spools in
dicated that the load would soon arrive,
the suspense became all the greater.
"Here it comes," was an almost
unanimous whisper. When the little
train of cars emerged a shudder was
visible in the crowd. First there came
two cars loaded with coal, then three
cars, in each of which there were two
bodies. In one were two brothers, side
by side, John and Salem Haiston. In
the others were Robert Davidson and
John Bennett, William Pritchard and
John Cartwright. James Hill was in
the last car.
When the bodies were brought up
from the mines, they presented a
ghastly appearance. Their faces were
begrimmed with black dust of the
mines. Before they were brought out
the rescuers tied handkerchiefs around
th^lr heads to give them a better ap
pearance. After the first lot of bodies
had been brought out, the excitement
grew more intense. There were yet
many men in th-s mine, and there was
more anxiety to know who would be
brought out next. During the entire
afternoon there was a desperate wait.
It was announced many men had come
out of the mine from an abandoned
entry nearly three miles distant. This
allayed the fears of many, and as fast
the men were accourted for to their
friends and families rejoicings and
congratulations followed.
At 9 o'clock to-night the last of the
explorers from the mine came out and
announced there was nothing living or
dead in the mine, leaving the list of fa
talities as given. To-nieht there is a
constant stream of people passiner in
and out of the undertaking establish
ments to view the bodies.
the bay street. Thirteen lives were lost.
The full extent of the damage has not
yet been computed, but It is incompar
ably less than at St. Vincent. The hur
ricane struck the island of Barbadoes
on the night of the 10th, completely
wrecking that flat, exposed island and
sweeping away 10,000 houses, while
damaging thousands more. It left three
quarters of the inhabitants homeless.
Over 200 people were killed, so far as
known. The city of Bridgeto-n was
partly destroyed and the suburbs, St.
Michael and Belleville, were entirely
demolished. All the shipping was
wrecked or blown out to sea. In the
country the desolation is awful, owing
to the destruction of the provision
grounds on which the population de
pended. While all the parishes suf
fered, the greatest distress is in St.
Michaels, Christ Church and St. Philip.
All the sugar estates are damaged and
many of them are completely wrecked.
But, while the cultivation of cane has
suffered considerably, the cane has not
been totally ruined, as first reported,
the damage not exceeding one-fifth of
the cane. The total estimated damage
besides the loss on the cane crop and
provisions is about $1,500,000 at Barba

From It Poured Abuse
of Jarman.
LET PASS NO OPPORTUNITY

ACCUSATIONS.
Numerous Witnecses Testify to the
Charges Oft Preferred by the
"Boss" Against the City
Official.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Sept. 23.â 1n the Jarman-
Rea slander suit to-day a large num
ber of witnesses were examined, and all
gave testimony showing that Rea lost
no opportunity to tell his story impli
cating Jarman in alleged crookedness
In the purchase of a steam roller. The
attorneys on both sides are making a
hard fight and not the smallest point
is being overlooked. The prosecution's
case is nearly finished and when the
court convenes on Tuesday it is ex
pected the defense will make a motion
for a non-suit. This will require a
couple of days' argument at least. The
courtroom continues to be crowded, as
people are curious to learn the intrica
cies of politics as practiced by the gang.
At the opening of court Judge Kit
tredge announced that he would sus
tain the objection of the defense to the
introduction of Landers' testimony re
garding the witness' inference as to the
words spoken by Rea. Mr. Delmas
then asked Landers what he under
stood the words uttered by Rea to
mean. The objection was again made
and sustained and an exception noted
by Delmas.
George Koenig was the next witness.
He is a painter and paper-hanger and
was employed by Jarman in painting
Mrs. Goodrlch's fence at the time of the
trcruble. He heard Rea tell Jarman
that what he said behind a man's back
he would say to his face.
"That $900 was paid on the purchase
of that steam roller and you got $400
or $425 of it." said Rea.
The witness said Jannan denounced
this as a lie.
Archibald McDonald, general man
ager of the San Jose Woolen Mills, tes
tilied that at a meeting of the directors
of the Hotel Vendome last month Rea
had stated that Jarman had received
money on the steam roller. There were
present at the meeting, besides the wit
ness, James Dougherty, Joe Rucker, Ed
Clayton and Rea. Jarman's name was
brought up in a discussion of the vari
ous candidates. Rea said that while
Jarman was a member of the City
Council the steam roller was purchased;
$y(Â»0 had been divided among the Coun
cilmen and he believed Jarman got his
portion of it. The witness said Rea
stated that he "didn't see the money
paid to Jarman, but he believed he got
$400 of it." Rea aiso Bald "Jack was
not straight," in regard to city affairs.
Ex-Councilman E. P. Main was
called and everybody expected some
sensational testimony. Instead he was
only asked a few questions. He said
that just after Rea and Jarman had
the altercation near Mrs. Goodrich's
place he rode past on a wheel. Rea
cried out: "Hello, E. P.; I was just
asking Jarman whether it was $420 or
$450 he got out of the steam roller."
J. B. Church, former superintendent
of the Infirmary, said that last March
Rea stopped him on the street and ask
ed him why he was advocating the
election of Jarman. The witness an
swered:
"Because Jarman and I are old ac
qtiaintances. I know Jarman to be
honest and capable."
"If Jarman could be proved dishonest
would you support him?" Rea asked.
"No; If he were dishonest I would
drop him as quickly as I would a hot
potato," was Church's reply.
Rea then told the witness his story
of the steam-roller purchase.
Joseph H. Rucker and E. W. Clayton,
directors of Hotel Vendome, substan
tiated the testimony of McDonald.
Rucker said Rea declared that Jarman
was not honest and that the agent for
the steam-roller told him that he had
paid the Councilman $900 and that Jar
man "had taken some of the money or
was a fool and was having his leg
pulled." Rea said he knew of the mat
ter in that way. Clayton testified that
Rea told those at the meeting he did
not think Jarman was "square," and
his connection with the purchase of the
steam-roller was not above reproach.
The witness said that Rea said the
roller had been offered to him for $900
less than the city paid.
E. A. Hayes, president of the Good
government League, was called. Rea
had questioned him about the Good
Government League and asked If Jar
man belonged to it. He then charac
terized Jarman as "a member of the
boodle Council to which Dittus and
Krieg belonged, and the worst of them
all." Hayes said that, personally, he
was hot unfriendly to Mr. Rea. but was
opposed to his political methods and
had denounced the workings of the
gang in control of municipal affairs as
corrupt.
L. Seldenberg. representative of the
San Francisco Call, testified that he In
terviewed Rea in regard to the state
ment about Jarman. The Interview as
published was admitted as evidence. It
was along the line of the testimony al
ready given.
J. R. Patton had a talk with Rea and
asked the latter if he thought Jarman
got any of the money paid on the roller.
Rea answered:
"Yes, I think so; why, of course."
City Clerk Cook presented docu
mentary evidence showing purchase of
a roller. E. T. Sawyer, reporter
for the Mercury, lndentified an article
appearing in that paper as an inter
view with Rea. There was objection to
parts of the Interview being admitted.
Before the question was decided the
court adjourned until Tuesday morning
at 10 o'clock.

Delaware Authorities
Preparing New Papers.
SOME AFFIDAVITS ADDED
WARRANT SWOBN TO BY THE
FATHER OF THE VICTIMS.
Legal Veroiage Changed in Order to
Conform to California Laws
in Requisition Pro
ceedings.
Bpecial Dispatch to The Call.
DOVER, Del., Sept. 23.â The office of
Secretary of State Hughes looked like
an express packing-room soon after
Attorney General White arrived to-day
and settled down to hard work on the
poisoning case. The Attorney General
had received immense boxes and crates
from San Francisco containing magni
fied writings, photographs and other
mechanical evidence that will be neces
sary in the trial of Mrs. Adelaide Cor
delia Botkin for the murder of Mrs.
Deane and Mrs. Dunning. In fact the
Attorney General has no idea that the
Delaware authorities will fail in their
efforts to get the woman.
Secretary Hughes started early this
morning on the new requisition papers
which are much more full of phrase
ology and legal verbiage than the oth
ers and are accompanied by a lengthy
affidavit and the warrant of former
Congressman Pennington, who certifies
that his daughter, Mrs. Ada H. Deane,
the first of the victims to die, "did live,
exist and have being in the town of
Dover, etc., until killed, murdered, etc.,
by one Adelaide Cordelia Botkin of the
State of California by means of poison
sent through the United States mails
with full knowledge and mai.ee afore
thought, in sweet meats and chocolate
candy."
Cashier Walter Morris of the Farm
ers' Bank, who was the custodian of
the box of candy, which has figured so
prominently in the Investigation 3500
miles across the continent, and Con
fectioner Stephenson, who examined
the candies, were each* closeted with
the --.ttorriey General for nearly half
an hour. The Attorney General con
tinued his affidavit hunt until this
evening.
The requisition paper is now more In
the form of an indictment, while the
tJrst one was in the nature of a com
plaint. The one made out to-day was
framed to conform with the California
laws Besides the large number of ex
hibits attached to it exact copies of the
affidavits made by the Delaware and
San Francisro witnesses accompany it.

CONVICT GOULD
AGAIN IN PRISON
Recaptured Near Camp
Taylor.
MARIN'S WAN HUNT ENDED
RELENTLESS PTJUSUIT OF THE
ESCAPE.
He Shows Fight When Overtaken
and Is Wounded by a Bullet
From an Officer's
Bevolver.
Bpeclal Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, Sept. 23.â For just
four days and five nights Alton H.
Gould, the convict "trusty" who es
caped from San Quentln by scaling the
walls at night, was permitted to Inhale
the air of freedom and amuse himself
by rifling houses of valuables. Last
Sunday evening Gould effected his es
cape. To-night the fellow lies in a
dungeon, with the prospect of ten years
more in prison instead of five before
him.
The credit of the capture belongs to
Constable Louis Hughes and Guard
Benjamin Merritt. At risk of life they
accomplished what whole posses had
failed to do.
At 11 o'clock last night Hughes, Mer
ritt and The Call correspondent took
the trail of Gould, near Fairfax, after
he had obtained a Bhotgun and am
munition by robbing a cabin near San
Anselmo, and followed it unceasingly
until his capture was effected at noon
to-day. The trail led for the most part
along the road leading to Olema and
Gould's footsteps were distinguishable
by the fact that they appeared as
though his shi ?s were tied to his feet
with ropes. The night was pitch dark
in the lonely canyons and the trail
could be followed only by lighting a
candle and looking for Gould's foot
prints at intervals of a hundred yards
and at cross-roads.
Gould traveled very fast and suc
ceeded in temporarily baffling his pur
suers. At about 4:30 o'clock this morn
ing he took a path diverging from the
main road. His pursuers h irried to
Tocaloma, about five miles further on,
in the hope of ambushing the convict.
Missing htm there they returned and
were informed by Mrs. Stedman that
Gould had passed through her yard,
carrying a shotgun under a brown
overcoat. He wore leggings stolen at
San Anselmo, which accounted for the
peculiar prints made by his feet. Mrs.
Stedman said Gould had crossed the
street and entered the brush.
The correspondent was dispatched to
Warden Hale with the news and a re-
quest for reinforcements, while Hughes
and Merritt retraced their steps. At
10 o'clock a man named Rodgers, liv
ing near Camp Taylor, told them Gould
was only a short distance ahead and
keeptng in the bed of the creek flow
ing near the road. They overtook him
within a half mile of Tocaloma. Creep
ing: up as close as possible Hughes pre
sented his shotgun and shouted:
"Tour hands up, Gould."
"With an oath, the convict turned and
started to raise his gun, but a scatter
ing charge of bird shot changed his
mind, and he sprinted for the brush
with his pursuers fast gaining.
Hughes' second cartridge snapped and
he drew his revolver and began to pep
per away. Merritt shot four times
with his revolver and as Gould leaped
a fence and entered the brush they
closed in. The convict was found ly
ing under some scrub oaks and was
forced to surrender. He was manacled
and brought to San Anselmo on the
train.
There Warden Hale and Captain Bir
lem were waiting with a carriage.
Gould complained of pain in his left
side, and an examination by Dr. Law
lor, the prison physician, showed that
a revolver bullet had inflicted a flesh
wound.
Gould's haggard face plainly tells of
little food and less sleep. He says he
is suffering with consumption and if
kept in prison cannot' live longer than
two years. As five years were still
before him he tried to escape and get
to a better climate. Five years were
all the same aa twenty to him anyhow
and credits cut no figure.
"I am unacquainted with the coun
try," he said, "and cannot tell where I
have been all the time. I subsisted
on grapes and apples until I was- so
woak I could hardly stand. Three dif
ferent times I have lain hidden within
ten feet of men searching for me and
could hava killed several, but I have
shed all the blood I ever shall."

THE BOARD UNABLE
TO PLACE THE BLAME
THE THOMAS DAMAGES MAY BE-'
MAIN UNSETTLED.
General Miller, However, Hopes to Be
Able to Satisfactorily Adjust
the Matter in a Few Days.
The report of the board of Inquiry ap
pointed by General Miller to fix the re
sponsibility for the damage done the
property of Zero Vhomas was submitted
to General Miller yesterday. It will be
remembered that In Its first report the
board only Implicated Privates Davis and
Anderson of the Tennessee Regiment.
Colonel Smith refused to pay the dam
ages, which were assessed at $231, because
he declared that other soldiers than those
of his own regiment were concerned in tne
affair. The report then weqt back to tne
board, and it was Instructed to fix the
blame upon the responsible parties. The
board has been considering the question
for several weeks, and In Its second re
port declares that It is unable to find any
additional guilty parties.
General Miller refused to let the report
be given out and would not discuss It. It
Is said that Major Cheatham of the Ten
nessee Regiment refused to divulge to thÂ«
board the names of five or six men that
he saw in the mob. The board is saiu io
have reported that soldiers of the lowa
and Kansas regiments were also con
cerned In the affair, but it was unable to
ascertain who these soldiers were. Col
onel Smith has stated, and so written to
General Miller, that he was willing to
make all fair compensation to the Thomas
family, but he did not want his regiment
to be the only one to bear the blame. The
E resent report will be sent to Colonel
mith, and as the damage is small It is
believed that it will be paid and the inci
dent closed. It is in General Miller's
power to appoint a new board or else to
assess the damage among the oinerent
regiments of the brigade. The general Is
hopeful of obtaining a satisfactory solu
tion of the matter in a few days.
Formal charges have l>pen preferred
against Private John B. Moore of tnÂ«
Tennessee Regiment, and he will be tried
by a general court-martial. Moore, it will
be remembered, on "-Tuesday night went
into the restaurant of Mrs. Hard, 2749
Greenwich street, ordered a supper and
went away without paying for it. He also
wrenched the arm of Mrs. Hard in break
ing past her to leave the place. Several
of his comrades who were with him will
be brought before a summary court. Sev
eral unimportant court-martial cases were
approved both at brigade and post head
quarters yesterday by General Miller.
The AVar Department has issued an
order announcing that the applications of
enlisted men for discharges, whether ap
proved or disapproved, shall be forwarded
to the Secretary of War. This order Is
the result of the holding back by officers
of applications for discharges, and may
result in an investigation.
Private Henry F. Judson, Battery D,
California Heavy Artillery, died at the
division hospital yesterday of typhoid
fever.
The Second Battalion of the Washing
ton Regiment will remain at Angel Island
until the regiment sails, and will not be
â brought over to the Presidio, as previous
ly ordered.
Mme. Modjeska visited the Presidio yes
terday morning, and was the guest of
Colonel Wholley of the Washington Regi
ment. She witnessed guard mount and
was afterward shov/n over the garrison
by Colonel Wholley.
HUNDREDS OF COTTAPES
HAVE BEEN DESTROYED
Italian Peasants in Flight Before
Three Streams of Lava From
Vesuvius.
NEW YORK, Sept. 23.â A cable to
the World from Naples says: There
are three lava streams descending re
spectively toward the villages of Ve
trana and Crocelle and the town of
Resina. The last named Is seriously
threatened. It is a place of 13,000 In
habitants, directly on the coast and
five miles southeast of Naples.
Panic prevails at Torre del Greco,
three miles south of Resina. Peasants
on the hillsides are moving out with
whatever they can save, leaving the
lava to devour their cottages and out
buildings and vines. Hundreds of cot
tages have been destroyed.
Showers of rocks and ashes have al
ready wounded fifty-six persons, but no
loss of life has yet occurred.

ETTA H WINS IN

Peixotto.

THE RACE.

Backers at Remunera
tive Odds.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO. Sept. 23.-The racing
at the park this afternoon was viewed by
a largely Increased attendance, and the
bookies dealt out more pasteboard than
for some days past. The Merchants'
handicap, with Rubicon and Grady as the
stars, fell through, the owners of the
first named horse declining to start
Marplot. An event of less class was sub
stituted. Toriblo, P F and Ann Page
won at remunerative odds. Ringmaster
and Etta H proved the only successful
first choices.
The finish between that rare good piece
of racing machinery, Etta H, and the
high headed Peixotto in the five and a
half furlong- sprint was the feature of
the day's sport. The mare, with Gus AVil
son on her back, was a pronounced fa
vorite. Libertine enjoying second call
over Peixotto. Libertine was never in it
from the jump, and Shields gave it up
at the head of the stretch. In a long,
hard drive Peixotto lost the verdict by a
nose, due poMibly to Wilson's superior
finishing abilities on the favorite. At that
Peixotto is a hard horse to ride, and his
handling under Ames could scarcely have
been improved upon.
The opening event at six furlongs, the
wise ones figured, was oil from the can
for Dolore, but the mare is apparently
not at her best and she brought up in
third place, a swerve down the stretch
costing her a length or so. In a drive
Frawley with the leg up on the 8 to 1
shot Toribio led the heavily backed Tor
sion across the tape by a head. Pat Mur
phy started, but cut no figure.
In the seven and a half furlong selling
affair Ringmaster fell in with soft com
pany and ruled favorite in the betting
over Rosemaid. Away in front, the big
gelding was never headed, Winning at will
from Ockturuck. Rosemaid was lamentably
lacking in speed, finishiner a gloomy look
ing third. Ko Ko wa.s well supported, but
Snider appeared unable to get him to run.
Two or three trips at the timber-topping
game in Montana appear to have worked
wonders with P F. The ring took undue
liberties with the gelding, one of seven
starters in the fourth number on the card.
He simply galloped off the six furlongs,
stepping to town in itISH- Trappean, the
favorite, was in trouble when the bend
for home was reached, but hung on
gamely, taking the place from Home
stake. The latter with 'â¢Chimmie Fad
den" Houck in the saddle, stumbled and
nearly fell to his kneees at the head of
the stretch. There was a healthy play
on Oak Leaf, and the stable fancied the
horse, but a poor send-off operated
apainst his chance of winning.
Bonibel, a stout favorite, and Thorpe
up. hung crepe on many a door in the
closing chapter, a five furlong sprint. Ann
Page, ridden by Pie&ott, and second
choice in the ring, made the running- and
headed the favorite past the judges by
two lengths in the slow time of 1:03V4-

VENTURANS

Speakers.
ROUSING REPUBLICAN RALLY
HALL TOO SMALL TO HOLD ALL
WHO WOULD HEAB.
Republican Nominee Places Maguiro
on the Gridiron and the Gen
eral Draws a Few Com
parisons.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VENTURA, Sept. 23.â Henry T. Gage
and James G. Maguire shook hands at
the Ventura Railroad station thte
morning. The incident was agreeable,
but not exciting. Mr. Gage was alight-
Ing from the passenger coach when Mr.
Maguire was about to step aboard.
They recognized each other simulta
neously and exchanged the compli
ments of the day.
Mr. Gage on his arrival from Santa
Barbara on the morning train was met
at the depot by a delegation of leading
Republicans and escorted to the Hotel
Rose. The gentlemen meeting the
nominee were: O. Orr, B. T. Williams,
W. H. Barnes, F. S. Cook, F. W. Baker,
E. S. Hall, J. S. Collins, E. M. Jones, D.
S. Blackburn and J. H. Mason.
Mr. Gage is acquainted with many
residents of this city and the region
roundabout, and so put in the better
part of the day chatting with old
friends. Early in the afternoon the
arrival of voters from neighboring dis
tricts began. A special train of the
Ojai Valley brought 100 people. Dele
gations came from Santa Paula and
Hueneme. It soon became manifest
that the demonstration in honor of the
Republican nominee would .be one of
the greatest ever held in this county.
A delegation headed by E. S. Hall,
chairman of the Republican County
Central Committee, went down the
road to Santa Paula and escorted Gen
eral Barnes to Ventura.
Among the prominent Republicans
who participated in the reception to
Mr. Gage and who attended the mass
meeting to-night were: C. D. Bone
stel, J. R. Willoughby, Guadalupe El
well, Frank Hobart, W. D. F. Richards,
J. C. Youngken, James Hobart, J. K.
Gries, John Carnes, W. C. Richmond,
T. R. Bard, D. W. Matt, J. S. Collins,
D. T. Perkins, James Walker, N. Black
stock, Lloyd Selby, H. C. Sexton. Wil
liam Ramsey, C. C. Teague, N. W.
Blanchard Jr., Robert Clark, F. T.
Fairbanks, K. Snow Jr., E. R. Hill,
Ralph Hill, J. S. Blackstock, C. B.
Greenwell, T. S. Newby, *â . W. An
drews, J. J. Burke, R. Freeman and
Earle Soule.
Shortly before 8 o'clock Henry T.
Gage, General W. H. L. Barnes and
Mr. Blackstock were escorted to Arm
ory Hall, the Ventura City band lead
ing the procession. The hall at this
hour was filled to overflowing by as
fine an audience as ever assembled in
California. The crush was so great
that many seeking admission could
find no room inside and had to content
themselves with a position near the
main doors, where something of the
speeches could be heard.
There was no delay after the arrival
of the speakers. As soon as the cur
tain was raised disclosing to the view
of the audience a stage crowded by
representative Republicans, Mrs.
Myrtle Bagley Mason stepped to the
front and sang "The Star-spangled
Banner." She was accompanied by the
Ventura band. The rendition evoked
tremendous applause.
E. S. Hall called the meeting to or
der and announced F. S. Cook of Ven
tura as chairman. Mr. Cook was brief
In his remarks. He Introduced Henry
T. Gage as the next Governor of Cali
fornia. Cheering and applause were
maintained for several minutes indi
cated the popularity of the nominee
and the ardent enthusiasm of the Ven
tura Republicans.
Mr. Gage thanked the audience for
the generous greeting, and announced
at once that his remarks would not be
extended, as he desired to gratify the
people present by giving all the time to
the matchless and eloquent orator,
General Barnes. Gratitude was ex
pressed for the support which the dele
gation from Ventura County gave him
in the State convention at Sacramento.
Mr. Gage said it was incumbent upon
him to repel the charge that the Ven
tura Republicans in that convention
were dominated by corrupt Influences.
The speaker asked:
"What right, in the name of common
justice, or in the name of common hu
manity, has Maguire to say that the
788 men who composed the Republican
State convention were railroad hire
lings? It would be dishonorable for me
to say such things of the body of men
who nominated Mr. Maguire. It is no
less unjustifiable In him to say such
things of the men who composed the
Republican convention at Sacramento.
He has been trying to find some justi
fication for his remarks about railroad
hirelings. He says The Call and Ex
aminer named the ticket before it was
nominated. Because these two papers,
after delegates caucussed, predicted
the ticket Mr. Maguire drew the Infer
ence that the ticket was named by the
railroad."
Mention was made that Mr. Maguire's
nomination was made five weeks be
fore the Democratic convention assem
bled and the conclusion suggested that,
according to Mr. Maguire's logic, the
railroad demanded his nomination.
Referring to the selection of Osborne
and Parker on the executive commit
tee to manage the Republican campaign
Maguire was quoted as having said
that such selection indicated that the
railroad was dominant, and to sustain
his assertion he had cited the Los An
geles Times. Mr. Gage remarked that
the Los Angeles Times had pronounced
Maguire an anarchist and asked if a
Democratic nominee desired to accept
the Times as an authority. Attention
was called to the fact that Parker and
Osborne were on the committee in 18%
and assisted in securing the election of
President McKinley, the great Presi
dent. If they were good enough to con
tribute to the national welfare In 1896
they were good enough to help in the
battle this year. In closing Mr. Gage
announced, as he did at Santa Barbara
last night, that he would, if elected
Governor, be dominated by no other in
fluence than a determination to give
the people of California a clean, eco
nomical and businesslike administra
tion of the affairs of this State.
A solo by Mrs. D. E. Clarke, with
violin and piano accompaniment, was
the next feature in the order of exer
cises.
General W. H. L. Barnes of San
Francisco was then introduced. He was
greeted with prolonged cheers, a dem
onstration that inspired the orator to
one of the happiest speeches of his life.
At the outset he denounced the South
ern Pacific Railroad for the outrageous
delays at Saugua, and spoke of the
purgatory Inflicted on the traveling
public. General Barnes observed that
he did not bring his gloves with him
and therefore proposed to handle Ma
guire without them.
The orator took up the party plat
forms and considered them plank by
plank. The Populist platform, the
"landslide of political ignorance," the
"avalanche of political stupidity," the
document which Maguire signed, was
reviewed in detail. The review of the
platform kept the audience in roars of
laughter.
The destruction of sixteen Spanish
ships of war in remembrance of the
Maine was a 16 to 1 proposition which
the orator ever admired. The audience
hailed the suggestion with shouts of
applause. The extension of American
supremacy to the territory conquered
in "the war, the prospect of Nicaraguan
canal construction and the general be
stowal of blessings on the human race
by the triumph of Republican prin
ciples engaged the attention of the
orator.
For more than two hours the au
dience listened with admiration to the
sentiments which he expressed. The
beautiful peroration in which the flag
was hoisted to the stars so fascinated
the vast assemblage that all remained
in their places for several minutes after
the general ceased speaking. The si
lence was not broken until the chair
man proposed three cheers for the Re
publican State ticket. This proposition
brought the audience back to earth
and cheers were given with great vigor.
Then some one in the audience pro
posed three cheers for General Barnes.
The multitude arose and gave three
mighty shouts of commendation.
Henry T. Gage and the general re
mained on the stage long after the
meeting proper closed to receive the
congratulations of resident and visiting

BROWN DECIDES
IN BARRY'S FAVOR
He Is the Democratic
Nominee.
SPELLING'S CLAIM SET ASIDE
FOURTH DISTRICT CONTEST AD-
Certificate of Nomination of the Con
testant Returned Without
Having Beea
Tiled.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 23.â Secretary
of State Brown this afternoon decided
in the matter of the contest of Carl T.
Spelling against James H. Barry that
Barry was the regular Democratic
nominee for Congress from the Fourth
District, and that Spelling had no claim
to a place on the ballot.
After reviewing the facts presented
on both sides the decision concludes as
follows:
It is undisputed that there ts a Demo
cratic State Central Committee, the vali- .
dlty of which is unquestioned. There is
also but one county committee recognized,
as representing said party in the Fourth
Congressional District. The so-called
Fourth Congressional District Committee,
under whose direction the convention that
nominated T. C. Spelling assembled, has
never been recognized by the Democratic
National Committee or the State Central
Committee, nor was it considered by the
late Democratic State Convention. Since
the adoption of the purity of election
law in California, no Democratic Con
gressional Committee has acted, or even
existed, except the single instance men
tioned herein. There was no default on
the part of any authority in
calling a Congressional convention in said
district for the nomination of a Congress
man; nor was said T. C. Spelling prohibited
from seeking a nomination from the same
convention that nominated James H.
Barry. In all the Congressional districts
in California the nominees of the Demo
cratic party for Congress were nominated
by conventions called together by the
State Central Committee, delegates to said
convention being appointed or elected by
or under the direction of the county com
mittees comprising said Congressional
districts.
In keeping with well-established prece
dents of the Democratic party in this
State, considering party customs, prac
tices and usages, and in the absence of
any law In California to the contrary, I,
as Secretary of State, for reasons afore
said, return the certificate of nomination
of Thomas Carl Spelling, without filing
the same.
I file the certificate of James H. Barry
as the nominee for Congress of the Demo
cratic party in the Fourth Congressional
District.

MR. MAGUIRE AT
SAN BERNARDINO
Addresses a Gathering
of the Faithful.
APOLOGIZES FOR HIS PARTY
DEFENDS ITS OPPOSITION TO
THE REVENUE BILL.
Democratic Nominee Reiterates the
Allegation That the Kailroad
Controls Republican
Candidates.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN BERNARDINO, Sept. 23.â A big
audience greeted James G. Maguire, the
fusion candidate for Governor, who spoke
to-night In the City Pavilion. A. M.
Kenniston was chairman of the meeting.
Secretary T. W. Tuckworth read the list
of vice-presidents, which included the
names of the county candidates. Each,
as he took his seat, was cheered.
E. L. Hutchinson was the first speaker.
He devoted most of his time to apologiz
ing for his party, the Free Silver Republi
cans, in having indorsed the Democratic
candidates.
Maguire took the stand amid much en
thusiasm. He opened up on the corpora
tions immediately. He declared monop
olies must be relegated to the past. To
his opposition of these institutions he at
tributed his success as a public man.
The Judge then took up a discussion of
platforms. He devoted a few moments
to the free silver question, and soon
drifted into ridicule of the opening cam
paign speeches of Mr. Gage and General
Barnes. He spoke at length on the war
situation. He said General Barnes seemed
laboring under the belief that the Repub
licans deserved the credit for the suc
cessful termination of the war.
"The history of its commencement will
show," said the speaker, "that the war
was forced upon the administration, not
sought by It. It was, nevertheless, equal
ly supported by Americans of all political
faiths. I honor the Republicans as well
as all others for their patriotism."
He then tried to impress the people
that the credit for the war belonged to
all alike, but that the blame for any
mistakes belonged to the Republicans.
Mr. Maguire went into an elaborate de
fense of the Democratic party in Con
gress for having hindered the passage
of the revenue bill. He said they were
attempting to have a tax placed upon the
wealth and corporate interests of the
country.
Mr. Maguire discussed Southern Pacific
influence. He claimed that If the Re
publican candidates were not Southern
Pacific men, they were representatives of
a Southern-Paclfic-made ticket and were
under Its influence. He said The Call
published the right ticket before it was
nominated; that The Call claimed to have
got Information by canvassing among the
delegates to the convention, but he (Ma
guire) thought The Call went to a great
deal of unnecessary trouble. It could
have Becured the information gratis at
the Southern Pacific offices.

An Ancient Custom.
From Republican Traveler, Arkansas City, Kan.
Pilgrimages to some shrine of St. Vltus
to cure the disease known as St. Vltus'

way of treating this affliction is within

The woman who suffers from weakness

gans is certain to become an invalid. No
woman can suffer in ' this way and be a
healthy, happy, amiable wifetond a compe-

the strength, rack the nerves, paint lines of
suffering upon the face, destroy the temper,
make the once bright eyes dull and the once
active brain sluggish, and transform a viva-
cious woman into a weak, sickly, invalid.
This is all wrong. It is all unnecessary.
Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription is a mar-
velous medicine for ailing women. It acts
directly on the delicate and important
organs that bear the burdens of matern-
ity and makes them strong and healthy.
It allays inflammation, ; heals ulceration,
. soothes pain and tones and j builds up the
nerves. It banishes the discomforts of the
expectant months and makes baby's com-
ing easy and almost painless. - It guarantees
the little new-comer's health and an ample
supply of nourishment. Thousands of
women have testified to its marvelous mer- .
its. An honest dealer will not endeavor to
substitute some inferior preparation for the
sake of an extra little selfish profit.
"I took Dr. Pierce's Favorite , Prescription
previous to confinement," writes Mrs. Corda
Culpepper, of Tanks, Cottle Co., Texas, "and

Democratic Conven
tion Deadlock.
PROGRAMMERS ARE ALARMED
HOT SURE OF THE NOMINEES
TOR THREE OFFICES.
Will Meet Again Monday and Pro
ceed With Nominations in Case
Certain Candidates Can
Be Frightened.
The Democratic Municipal Conven
tion met last evening and adjourned
until Monday evening, because there
was danger that the slate would be
broken If the business of making nomi
nations was proceeded with. The pro
grammers believe that between now
and Monday night they will be able to
bo fortify themselves that all Demo
crats who are not In favor with Mayor
Phelan and "Whispering" Gavin Mc-
Nab will be compelled to surrender
their desire to secure nominations at
the hands of the convention.
One of the slate candidates on whose
account the adjournment was taken
last night Is Edmund Godchaux. the
programme nominee for Recorder. A
careful poll of the convention was
taken yesterday, and to the great dis
may of the programmers it was found
that a majority of the votes were
pledged to Thomas J. Plnder. Pressure
was brought to bear on Pinder to cause
him to withdraw and he was threat
ened with public condemnation In the
party organ unless he did so. He re
fused, however, to be bluffed. It was
then decided that an adjournment
should be taken In order to allow time
in which still stronger pressure may be
brought to bear on him.
Another slate candidate who would
have been defeated had the convention
not adjourned is William T. Baggett,
who wants the nomination for City and
County Attorney. His chief opponent
for the place is Franklin M. Lane. As
In the case of Pinder it appears that
Lane has secured the personal pledges
of the majority of the mem
bers of the convention, and
is now in a position to defy the pro
grammers. Strong pressure will be
brought to bear on him between now
and Monday to Induce him to get out
of the fight. It is said that he has been
told that in case he does not Btep aside
the influence of Mayor Phelan will be
brought to bear to prevent him from
getting the Non-Partisan indorsement,
MADE THE^ORJT'DRW
OF THfEvENINGr â  "
even should he be so fortunate as to
break the slate and secure the Demo
cratic Domination.
J. G. Barrett has Treated still another
crack in' the slate, and there is now
grave doubt whether the programmers
will be able to secure the nomination of
Eugem- Deuprey for the office of Dis
trict Attorney. Barrett has many
friends among the members of the con
vention and is making a determined
fight for the nomination, with every
present prospect of winning out against
the organized opposition.
With these conditions facing them it
is not to be wondered at that the pro
grammers decided to adjourn the con
vention until Monday, in order to give
themselves time in which to repair their
broken fences.
As soon as the convention was called
to order last night Chairman McGee
called for the report of the special com
mittee to which had been intrusted the
task of preparing a Supervisorial slate
for ratification by the convention.
George McGillivary. chairman of the
committee, announced that the commit
tee had canvassed several names, but
had not yet made any selections. He
asked the members of the convention
to assist the committee by handing in
the names at all who are desirous of
receiving a nomination for member of
the Board of Supervisors.
W. B. Cope, chairman of the commit
tee appointed to canvass the names of
prospective nominees for members of
the Board of Education, reported that
his committee would not be prepared
to make a final report until Monday
evening. He also made the request that
members of the convention hand to the
committee the names of such men as
they wished to secure the coveted nomi
nations. He said that the committee
had already had under consideration
the following names:
F. H. Gibson, Julius Frankel, John
Shanahan, O. H. Bowen, Dr. D. E.
Boyce, Benjamin Armer, J. W. C. Max

When Judge Cope had completed his
report P. F. McCarthy moved that the
convention adjourn until this evening.
Joseph Nougues objected to this, and
declared that the adjournment should
be taken until Monday evening. He
said that the two sub-committees
would not be ready to report before
that time, and that It would be a waste
of time to meet again before Monday.
Some one asked why the convention
could not go ahead a%d make other
nominations, but Nougues was not ans
wering questions of that sort, and the
chairman declared the convention ad
journed before any discussion could be
had. The adjournment was taken until
Monday evening.

Association, setting forth the aims and
objects of the association, was adopted:
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 23, 1898.
To Members of the Railway Employes' Asso
ciation of Californiaâ Gentlemen: This organi
zation having been subjected to much unjust
criticism and comment on the part of a por
tion of the press, your advisory board deems
It wise that we should clearly define our posi
tion, and with that end In view hereby recom
mends for the special consideration of the
members the following, as being a statement of
the objects and principles of this asaociatlon.
PREAMBLE.
The Railway Employes' Association of Cali
fornia hereby declares the objects and alms of
this association to be:
1. To awaken railway employes to a sense of
thetr rights and responsibilities as citizens of
their country.
2. To gain for them political recognition,
standing and place.
3. To. when feasible and advisable, nominate
and support for office men from among rail
way employes; otherwise to support for of lice
only those who will deal Justly with railway
employes' rights and interests.
4. To protect in all things the interests of
railway employes and to oppose with united
political strength all who wuuld act directly
or indirectly to the detriment of those inter-
ests.
6. To, as far aa proper consideration of the
interests of railway employes will permit, avola
injuring or antagonizing the interests of others.
an.l to be Just and conservative in all policies
ajid methods.
DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES.
In furtherance of the foregoing objects, the
following are declared to be the fundamental
principles of this association:
First â That this Is a non-partisan association,
being political only in t,he sense of being pro
tective of those interests from which we gain
our livelihood and the proper advancement of
our political Interests and standing.
Secondâ We hold It to be our bounden duty
to unite for our common defense against the
assaults of designing persons, who. from mo
tives of self-interest, would do ourselves and
those dependent upon us great and irreparable
injury.
Thirdâ That in the ranks of the railway em
ployes are to bÂ« found men of high character
and amply qualified to nil acceptably and cred
itably any office within the gift of the people;
and 'believing that we are entitled to fair
recognition at the hands of political parties.
we will endeavor by all honorable means to
obtain for our members such recognition, and
in the event of nomination for office <~,f any
member of our association such nominee should.
Irrespective of party affiliation, receive our
loyal support.
Fourthâ That aFlde from the desire to hon
orably advance the political interests and
standing of railway employes to a degree
equal with other classes of citizens, we declare
It to be Inconsistent with the non-partisan
character of our organization to urge upon any
political convention the nomination of any par
ticular person or to give our united support to
the nominee of any particular political party,
except in caÂ»os where our Interests are most
likely to suffer in the event of the election of
persons who may not be disposed to deal Justly
with such interests.
Fifthâ That we fully recognize the right of
any member of this association to vote as he
chooses and to fully and freely affiliate with
the party representing his political faith, and
furthr-r, that no pledge be required from any
member of this association to vote any particu
lar ticket or for any particular candidate, but
on the contrary, the utmost faith and reliance
Is reposed in the honor of each member to art
nnrt vote for the best interests of his coworkers
and fellow employes.
Sixthâ That we deny the right and repudiate
the assumption of any person or persons,
whether railroad employes or not, to, without
our advice and consent, enter into any political
arrangement whatsoever which may be based
upon our united support.
Seventhâ That any nnd all political matter*
In which we as raihv;iy employes are concern
ed, to receive the consideration of this asso
ciation or any branch thereof, should be com
municated through the regular channels pro
vided by this association, viz: for matters con
cerning thÂ» association at large, the udvlsory
board: for local affairs, the executive commit
tees of the x'arlous clubs, or by direct communi
cation with the clube. â¢
F.ighthâ That In order to preserve the non
partisan character of our organization, per
sons other than railway employs and particu
larly candidates for office, should not be In
vited to address our clubs on political or par
tisan topics.
Ninthâ That we will endeavor. In so far as It
may be possible, to remove from the field of
political controversy any further agitation oi
the rallrond question, to the end that we may
enjoy In peace and contentment the fruits of
our Industry as represented by our dally wages.
Should the foregoing declaration of principles
meet with the approval of a majority of the
clubs, provision will be made for printing the
same; and with that end In view, will your
club without delay, kindly ndvlge Its approval
or rejection of the same. Yours respectfully,
H. L. SANBORX.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 23.
The situation of the Non-Partisan
movement to-day Is not very encourag
ing. The little meeting last night, presid
ed over by J. A. Beckwith, was not so
largely attended as was anticipated, and
even Dr. Tom Carpenter of Alameda.who
was the ruling spirit of the occasion,
failed to enthuse the gallery. In fact, af
ter the meeting Carpenter denied that he
had attended It.
Four years ago and several weeks after
H. P. Dalton had announced his Inde
pendent candidacy for Assessor and had
practically won his campaign, the Non-
Partisan movement was created which
nominated a complete ticket. Among
those favored at the time by this move
ment were Henry Dalton, Ed Fitch, J.
"W. Ward, J. W. Tompklns, Harry Morso
and â > few others. With the exception of
Dalton none was elected, although the
vote given to Harry Morse undoubtedly
made the election of a Populist certain.
At this time there does not seem to be
any more useful field in which the Non-
Partisans can work than to make It pos
sible for some fusion candidates to be
elected, and this is what Chairman Beck
wlth states is their object. After the
meeting last night he said: "We aregoing
along quietly and will have a conference
with the Democrats and Populists to Bee
what can be done. It is possible that we
may hold a separate convention."
It has been freelv stated that -*Â«.r. Dal
ton is behind the movement this year, but
he absolutely denies it. "I have the Re
publican nomination," said he this after
noon, "and I want to see the ticket elect
ed. I am not giving my support in any
way to this Non-Partlsan movement, but
If they like to Indorse me 1 shall not re
pudiate such action. This is a year in
which all Republicans should stand to
gether, so that we can prove by our ma
jority in November that we were prop
erly represented by Dr. Pardee at the
State convention."
Tom H. Robinson, who was a candidate
for Tax Collector but who did not go be
fore the convention, denies all statements
that he is in any way allied with the
Non-Partlsan movement.
"I am not a candidate for anything,"
he said to-day, "and will not be. I am
absolutely out of the race for nomina
tions, and Non-Partisans or any other
body will be wasting their time putting
my name on their ticket. I am a Repub
lican, and I desire to see the ticket elect
ed from Governor to constable, as was so
well put by Dr. Pardee at the county con
vention."
The general feeling among Republicans
is that this is no time for ambitious or
disappointed politicians to be given an
opportunity to disrupt the Republican
party under any pretext whatsoever.
For over- a year this county has been
hysterically calling attention to its loyal
Republicanism, and now that the State
has conceded practically to Alameda the
privilege of naming the next Republican
nominee to head the State ticket, the
party men naturally desire that the ma
jority for Gage shall certainly be a little
larger than that given to McKlnley.
OAKLAND'S PRIDE.
Young Republicans Enthusiastically
Ratify Their Nominations.
OAKLAND, Sept. 23.â The Young Men'B
Republieation League held a ratification
meeting to-night, which was attended by
most of the county and legislative candi
dates. Dr. Mehrmann, candidate for
Coroner, made a very effective argument
on the talk of a slate at the county con
vention.
"In my ward," said the doctor, "we had
a hard fight in ttie primaries. A strong
ticket was put up against mine, that was
headed, 'Against the slate.' This did not
fool the people, however, for they clearly
saw that the 'anti-slate ticket' was just
what it pretended not to be, and they beat
it by a big majority. All this talk of slate
is the work of soreheads, and will not af
fect the ticket."
Arthur Feidler of Llvermore, Charles
Spear of Berkeley and Joseph B. Barber
oi Alameda were among the speakers.

SUISUN, Sept. 23.â The Republican
BURDETT CHANDLER
GROWN WEARY OF
THE DEMOCRACY
Member of the Los Angeles Cen
tral Committee Comes Out for
Hon. Henry T. Gage,
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 23.â Burdett Chandler, one of the oldest
Democrats in Los Angeles County, a citizen of high standing and
possessing large property interests, a member of the Democratic
County Central Committee, has publicly announced his withdrawal
from the party of his past faith and openly declares that he will sup
port Henry T. Gage for Governor. In a letter Mr. Chandler declares
himself somewhat forcibly as follows:
Dr. R. W. Hill, Chairman Democratic Central Committee, Los Angeles, Cal.
Dear Sir: I believe that for ththe past six or eight years the Demo
cratic party has been going to the devil, on the down grade, with the track
greased by the Stiver Republicans and Populists. And as a Democrat I
feel that I cannot touch the present slopbncket ticket made at Santa
Monica on the 21st and 22d of this month with a pole (with one or two ex
ceptions). I feel in duty bound to resign from the Los Angeles County
Democratic Central Committee, and hereby tender 'my resignation, not
from the Democratic party but from the Central Committee. Most re
spectfully, B. CHANDLER.
Member from the Sixty-fifth Precinct.
Mr. Chandler's letter, when made public, came as a great sur
prise. He had attended the Democratic county convention and it was
supposed that he was In line with his party. To The Call corre
spondent he said:
"My first vote was cast for Stephen A. Douglas for President,
and I have voted for every Democratic candidate for President since!
I have always regarded these unholy alliances the Democrats have
made as productive of no good to the party of which I have so long
been a member. But for six years now fusion has been going on. I
cannot see where we have gained, but I do see where we have lost. In
my judgment the only way to put a stop to it is to defeat the whole
combination, and then honest Democrats who are in the fusion move
ment will look upon it as unprofitable. As soon as they find this out
the way will be open to get back to a good old Democratic basis.
Then we can nominate straight Democrats for office, make a fight on
Democratic lines and principles, and, if we succeed, have a good, hon
est Democratic administration of public affairs. For these reasons and
to accomplish this end I leave what is called the Democratic party of
to-day, and when It is rehabilitated I will return."

THE IROQUOIS.
Spelling's Case Stjll Open but Indi
cations Poini to Trouble.
The case of T. Carl Spelling no more
than showed its head at the meeting of
the Iroquois Club last evening. There
was an effort made to have the matter
brought to a crisis next Wednesday even
ing, but the constitution has a clause or
two which blocks such a mode of pro
cedure, and so the case was allowed to
go along In the hands of the committee
which now has It in charge.
The committee held a meeting and
haled Spelling before it he responded, but
asked for more time, and was given until
Wednesday afternoon, when the commit
tee will meet and hear what he and oth
ers have to say. A report will be made
to the club at its meeting next Friday,
and then Spelling will be disposed of.
Some indication of the probable course
of the club can be gathered from the ac
tion last night of the committee on prim
ary law appointed by the Iroquois to
meet with similar committees from other
clubs. Spelling was the chairman of this
committee and the ground was cut from
under him last nignt by the discharge
of the committee and the appointment of
a new one In which Spelling's name does
not figure. The old committee was T.
Carl bpelling, Charles -Glldea and Max
Popper; now it is Max Popper, Charles
Gildea and W. M. Cannon. The reason
given for the change was that Spelling
was not a proper representative of the
club.
The resignation of Dr. Rottanzi, which
has lain for over a year in the secretary's
desk, was dragged from its slumbers Into
the light and accepted. Rottanzi handed
in his resignation when the club de
nounced the solid eight more than a year
ago.
It was decided that the club should
open the campaign with a big mass meet
ing to be held in Metropolitan Hall next
Saturday night, and to attend the meet
ing to be held at that place this evening
in a body.
On the matter of bullshead breakfast It
was reported that a big affair would be
given at San Leandro on either the third
or fourth Sunday of October, the date
to be definitely fixed when it is known on
which of those two dates Mr. Maguire can
be present.

AMBITION OF CANDIDATES IS
THE ONLY DANGER.
Some Very Queer Combinations That
Will Probably Be Consum
mated at the Con
ventions.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 23.
Barnum's "four great shows in one,
giving a continuous performance at the
same time," is not a circumstance com
pared to the combination of political ag
gregations that will assemble all over
town to-morrow.
There will be a great showâ actors ga
lore and scenes too many to put In even
a modern theatrical programme. Up to
this hour six distinct bunches of talent
have issued their cards announcing
their performances, and more are ex
pected before the doors open.
To-morrow mornisg the Democrats will
assemble at Germania Hall, not for the
purpose of naming a county ticket, but to
nominate as many men for office as the
fusion Populists, Silver Republicans, Bi
metallists, Independents and Non-parti
sans do not demand as their rightful
share of the spoils.
The remnant of the fusion Populistsâ
the middle-of-the-roadsters having a
ticket of their ownâ will assemble at
Grand Army Hall for the purpose of get
ting as many men upon the patchwork
ticket as the Democrats, Silver Republi
cans, Bimetallsts, Independents and Non
partisans can be persuaded to yield to
them.
For two days and nights this city has
been given over to conferences. Every
kind of political piece club has met in
conference either on the street corner or
in the rear of some real estate office, and
has decided upon some demand to make
upon the joint aggregation that wllP
assemble in different places to-morrow.
The Democrats have more than enough j
candidates to make three complete ticK
ets. The Populists could easily supply j
nominees for four counties. The Silver
Republicans are equally ambitious, while
the Non-partisans do not seem to have
profited by the fact that their ticket
four years ago was beaten from top to
bottom, and as to the Independents, they
will need a special ballot of their own.
Two years ago Alameda's Populists and
Democrats attempted to fuse. The at
tempt resulted in each party apparently
swallowing the other, for when the votes
were counted not a fusion candidate was
in sight. The prospect this year was no
brighter. Nothing could be more jocular
than to suppose that ex-Congressman
English will Join in ideas, platform and
campaign work with Auctioneer Rosen
berg. It Is almost as funny to Imagine
that Hon. W. W. Foote would conscien
tiously indorse a plauorm approved by
Dr. Oberg of Lorin. On the streets the
Populist is viewing the Democrat with
more than suspicion, and the Democrat
is generally returning the compliment.
Chairman Brosnahan of the Democratic
County Committee is blunt, but he has
the reputation of telling the truth. When
asked about fusion he replied: "Fusion,
what is it? We were supposed to have
some of it two years ago, and we had all
1 wanted of it."
Alameda's fusionists come from ele
ments too widely separated to be welded
with any degree of reliability. Prison
Director Fitzgerald is a good Democrat,
and Mr. Hougham is a good Populist, and
was a good anti-Chinese organizer, but
it would be hard to imagine Mr. Fitz
gerald and Mr. Hougham agreeing on a
political platform. Ex-Congressman |
Glascock is another representative Demo
crat, and Poet J. W. Dutton a representa
tive Populist, and here again there is a
divergence of ideas, and the same may
be said right along the line.
Nor apparently are all the elements al
ready mentioned the total of what will
constitute to-morrow's convention, for it
is openly stated that A. K. Grim, who
some weeks ago announced himself as a
good Republican, seeking a party nom
ination, will be nomnated for Recorder,
while Sam Heller, who has already been
nominated by the middle-of-the-road Pop
ulists for Sheriff, is equally confident that
he .will receive an indorsement at the
hands of the united convention.
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES.
There will be no lack of aspirants for
nomination when the local Republican
conventions meet next Tuesday night In
Native Sons' building.
The names of Horace Davis, Charles
Patton and Henry Martin are mentioned
In connection with the Mayoralty. Mar
tin, it is said, however, would not refuse
the nomination for Treasurer. L. M.
Jacobs is also In the race for the nomi
nation.
The leading candidates In tho fight for
County Clerk are W. A. Deane and Wil
liam Joost. Deane is said to have tho
Inside on the political racetrack.
Martin Fragley, the well-known Mission
livery stable keeper Is the favorite In
the tight for Street Superintendent. Ex-
Superintendent James Gllleran would not
decline the nomination, however.
Ex-School Director Barrett and ex-
Supervisor Heyer are contesting for first
places in the battle for the Audltorship.
Assessor John D. Siebe would not re
fuse another term In the office. Super
visor John Lachmann has a host of
friends, who are hard at work for him,
and they hope to be able to carry off the
political plum.
The fight for the shrievalty nomination
will be aji interesting one. There are a
number of aspirants In the field. School
Director Ed Head and William J. Blatt
ner, ex-County* Clerk, are at present in
the lead of the others. The friends of
Head are quite sanguine of getting their
favorite first past the wire.
Dewey Central Republican Club.
The regular meeting of the Dewey Cen

A Grand Republican Bally.
The executive committee of the Repub

gaged Woodward's Pavilion for a mass
meeting to be held a week from to-night,
when Henry T. Gage, Republican nominee
for Governor, and Jacob H. Neft, nomi
nee for Lieutenant Governor, will discuss
the issue of the present campaign. An
invitation has been extended to United
Stuates Senator Perkins to also address
the meeting.
They Jollied Themselves.
A well-attended meeting of the Thirty
fifth Assembly District Magulre Club was
held at Silk's Hall, Twenty-sixth street,
near Mission, on Thursday evening. Wil
liam Craig, the fusion nominee for con
gress in the Fifth District, and James H.
Barry, fusion nominee for Congress In
the Fourth, were the principal speakers,
and they "did up" the Republicans ac
cording to their usual methods. Mr. Craig
quoted poetry and Mr. Barry quoted
Wendell Phillips, and a county candidate
passed around several boxes of cigars
until the enthusiasm was at the usual
white heat.
Working for the Charter.
A communication has been received by
the Republican State Central Committee
from the Citizens' Charter Association,
earnestly requesting that the committee
exert its utmost endeavors to have the
district conventions insert a pledge in
their platforms requiring Oieir legislative
nominees to vote for the new charter of
San Francisco at the next session of the
Legislature.

OFFICER MARLOWE OFFICIOUS.
M. Xirby and His Son Were Unjustly
Arrested and Charged.
Police Officer Marlowe, he of the Tinker
Haynes tragedy, showed his offlciousness
last Saturday evening, with Officer Feeney,
when they arrested Michael Kirby and
son, John, on Sanchez street, for "ob
structing the sidewalk, disturbing the
peace and resisting an officer in the dis
charge of his duty."
Kirby and his son were on their way to
hear General Barnes deliver his lecture
in Metropolitan Hall when they met a
fentleman on the corner of Sanchez and
fifteenth streets and stopped to speak to
him for a few minutes. While doing so
the officer approached them and ordered
them to move on.
They said they were going downtown
and did not think they were violating
any law by standing on the sidewalk.
They were placed under arrest and with
the aid of Officer Feeney were carted off
to the Seventeenth-street station and four
charges placed against their names. The
cases were dismissed yesterday on the
motion of Prosecuting Attorney Graham,
who saw from the arresting officers' testi
mony that no offense was committed.
Kirby says that he will prefer charges
against Marlowe before the Police Com
missioners.
Was Merely His Attorney.
An article in yesterday's Call giving" an
account of the argument before Governor
Budd for the extradition of "Klondiker"
Davison stated that Reel B. Terry had
been associated with Davison in various
enterprises. This Mr. Terry denies. "My
sole and only connection with Davison,"
said Mr. Terry, "has been that of an at
torney employed in the civil stilt brought
against him, and subsequently, with J.
Hamilton. Lewis. I appeared before the
Governor and opposed the issuance of the
warrant for his return. For these services
Mr. Davison made arrangements to pay
me as his attorney, and before I was re
tained I was not acquainted with Davi
son."
Cars on Eighth Street.
It Is the intention of the Market-street
Railroad Company to have the Eighth
street electric cars running to-morrow.
For the present cars will stop at Eighth
and Market streets and from there will
run along Eighth to Bryant street to
Bryant avenue as far as Sixteenth street,
where they will turn into that street
running south as far as Kentucky, re-\
turning over the same route, thus bring
ing the Potrero and South Mission into
direct connection with the City Hall. It
is probable that transfers will be Issued
to and from all Market, Mission and
Howard street cars to this new line.
The Growth of Socialism.
It Is argued by deep thinkers that the growth
of socialism Is due to the large standing armies
of the world, In which men are often made to
enlist against their will, and thus become dts
contented with existing conditions. The growth
of a stronger race of people is due to the large
sale of Hostetter's Stomach Bitters, which is
the best medicine for costiveness, dyspepsia,
fever, ague and all nervous troubles. Try one
bottle.

NON-PARTISANS TOO QUICK-
THE Non-Partisans, as they choose to call
themselves, profess to be in favor of good gov
ernment: They regard as among their privileges
that of selecting from the nominees of the regular
parties the men whom they consider the best, and for
mally indorsing them. In theory they are on a lofty
plane. There are many other people who desire the
besi men for local office and do not care as to the
political affiliations of the men.
But have the Non-Partisans lived up to their de
clarations? They nominated Phelan for Mayor. They
did this before the Democratic convention, at which
hh nomination was a part of the programme, had
met. It strikes us that if they had been sincere they
would have waited. They do not know even yet
whom the Republicans will nominate. The choice
of the party may be a better man than Phelan. Yet
Phelan was on the programme of the Democrats.
He was at the head of the slate. There was no ne
cessity for indorsing him hastily. The Non-Partisans
could well have waited and ascertained what the Re
publicans intended to do.
Perhaps the fact that the Republicans have no slate
is unfortunate. As said above, it is quite
possible that fully as good a man as Phelan
will be put forward. It is not beyond the rang-e
of" possibility that a better man may be named
to lead the ticket. Nevertheless the Non-
Partisans have deliberately tied their own hands.
They have robbed themselves of the opportunity of
making an untrammeled choice. As to the head of
the municipal ticket they are already bound, whereas,
if they were sincere, they would have waited. They
hrive merely accepted the theory that Phelan is in
vincible, and, with a selfishness worthy of a worse
cause, have tried to climb into the band-wagon.
When the Republicans shall name the man of their
choice the Non-Partisans will realize that they have
been hasty. By indorsing Phelan in advance they
have destroyed their own influence. They marked
themselves as "programmers." This was an error of
judgment. They might be programmers and escape
rebuke, but they were guilty of a mistake when they
proclaimed the fact.
PROPOSED PfJRK IMPROVEMENTS.
WHILE there is sj much well-founded dissatis
faction among the people with nearly every
branch of our municipal administration, it is
gratifying that in tht Park Commission the city has
one administrative body to whose work the citizens
can point with pride, and to all of whose proposals
for further improvements attention can be given
without even a shadow of suspicion that anything in
the way of a job is to be furthered at the expense of
the taxpayers.
The commission has at this time a most notable
improvement under consideration, as was outlined in
The Call of yesterday. The improvement contem
plates the connection of the park with the Presidio
by the acquirement of seven blocks of land stretch
ing from the one to the other and lying between
Thirteenth and Fourteenth avenues. The title to a
considerable part of these blocks is already vested in
the city, .and there is reason to believe the remainder
nay be obtained by donations or contributions.
With the control of these blocks in the hands of
:he commission it would be possible to connect the
park with the Presidio by a grand plaisance occupy
ing the whole width between the two avenues â a
[pace ample enough to afford room for a broad drive
way with a roadway for horsemen and a bicycle track
is well. Nor would these occupy all the ground.
There would still be large spaces for trees, flowers
ind expanses of grass.
The appropriation for the maintenance of the park
6 not sufficient to enable the commission to purchase
:he portions of the blocks required, and the under
taking of the improvement i* therefore dependent
ipon the liberality of the property-owners and other
ritizens who may be willing to contribute to the pro
josed work. It is therefore to be seen what can be
Jone to obtain the needed donations and contribu
ions in time to begin the improvement this winter.
The benefits in the way of increased land values
rertain to accrue to all property in that ficighborhood
from the construction of the proposed driveway are
mch that the owners of the desired lots could well
ifford to donate them to the city, as was done by
hose, owning land along the line of the Dewey boule
rard. "Thej' have now an opportunity of enhancing
:he desirability of their property for residence pur
poses and at the same time aiding in the accom
plishment of a notable embellishment of the city, and
t is to be hoped they will promptly take advantage
>f it.
Somebody makes bold to call a Philadelphia paper
town for having said "The United States are," Yet
he constitution says the same thing:.
THE SAN FBAISTCIBCO CALL, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1898.
MR. GAGE'S CONVOSS.
J\A R. GAGE in making his canvass for the gov
/ \ ernorship had the good fortune at Santa Bar
* * bara, as at Los Angeles, of addressing the
people so shortly after Maguire that the contrast be
tween the language, the sentiments, and the political
methods of the two men was clearly discernible to
the public. It is one which counts so impressively in
favor of the Republican candidate that it will un
doubtedly go far in determining the result of the
vote of election day.
Perhaps the most striking feature of the contrast
between the rival candidates is that shown in the at
titude of each toward his opponent. Maguire goes
about denouncing and vilifying the Republican party,
the Republican State Convention and the Republican
candidates. Mr. Gage has no words of vilification for
any one, and makes use of denunciation only to con
demn the slanderous methods of his opponent.
Answering the charge made by Maguire and by
his supporting orators and organs that the members
of the Republican State Convention had been domi
nated by corrupt influences, Mr. Gage said at Santa
Barbara: "I take pleasure here to-night in denoun
cing that calumny. It is beneath a man who aspires
to the high office of Governor of this State to utter
such a statement. I would not have the temerity nor
the dishonor to say that the gentlemen who composed
the Democratic convention assembled at Sacramento
were a band of scoundrels or were dominated by cor
rupt influences. No, never would I make such an as
sault upon common manhood in that manner. It would
be dishonorable. Every Democrat, every Populist,
every man, woman and child in this audience who
hears my voice knows it would be dishonorable for
me to assail the integrity of such a body of men by
making such sweeping charges against them, and it
is equally reprehensible on the part of the gentleman
who heads the Democratic ticket to say such things
of the Republican convention."
In this single statement we have an illustration of
the striking contrast between the characters of the
two candidates. Mr. Gage discusses the issues of
the day as a statesman, conceding the honesty of the
rank and file of his opponents, but pointing out their
errors; Maguire rants like a demagogue, assailing
the character as well as the politics of any one who
differs from him. Mr. Gage appeals to intelligence;
Maguire to ignorance. The one expects a response
from reason, the other from prejudice. The Repub
lican looks for success to the better sentiments of
the voters, while the candidate of the fused factions
of discontent hopes to achieve a victory by exciting
one class of citizens against another and arousing
all forms of passion from rage to envy.
The people of California can hardly hesitate in de
ciding which of these two men is the better fitted to
fill the office of Governor â which is the more worthy
to be the chief magistrate of a great commonwealth.
The intelligence of the voters will note the contrast
between the two as the campaign goes on, and the re
stilt will be an overwhelming vote for the champion
of clean politics and fair debate â Henry T. Gage.
BERKELEY'S GREAT NECESSITY.
IF the regents of the University of California need
an object lesson in college presidents they may
profitably study for a brief period the record that
has been made by Professor Jordan of Stanford.
Not only has this learned man since he took up his
residence at Palo Alto lifted the Stanford institution
into worldwide fame, but he has himself become an
important factor in the intellectual and scientific life
of the country. Far and wide his opinions are
quoted and his scientific knowledge utilized, and it
cannot in the nature of things be very long before
Jordan will represent us abroad in almost everything
intellectual.
An instance of how a live college president by
keeping his thinker and pen moving can confer dis
tinction upon an institution under his charge is
shown by Professor Jordan's recent letter on the an
nexation of the Philippines. This subject is just now
enjoying the attention of the civilized world. Pro
fessor Jordan has not only tackled it with charac
teristic boldness, but he has evolved some ideas which
are at once thoughtful and original. He says the
Filipinos are no more fit for self-government than
so many monkeys, and he sententiously deals im
perialism this kind of a logical blow: "(i) Dominion
is brute force; (2) dependent nations are slave na
tions; (3) the making of men is greater than the
building of empires."
The terseness of Jordan's letter has caused it to be
everywhere quoted, and thousands are now hearing
of Stanford University who never knew that such an
institution existed before. Some of the jingo papers
are abusing him, which is additional advertising,
since it demonstrates that there is a college president
somewhere out West to whom it is necessary to pay
attention.
All this is business. While in his letters and
speeches Professor Jordan contributes a great deal
to the moving thought of the time, thus justifying
his existence in the world, the main result of his in
tellectual activity is the development of Stanford Uni
versity. Young men all over the country naturally
seek a college possessing such a president, and in
course of time parents will send their sons nowhere
else. If the regents of the State University will look
at this matter from a practical standpoint they will
observe that the way to make the institution in their
charge a national concern is to place at its head a
college giant like Jordan. With his prototype in the
State the intellectual fur would fly hereabouts in a
manner that would be at once lively and edifying. '
Besides, were a man like Jordan placed at the head
of the Berkeley institution the students there might
occasionally beat the Stanford boys at football. A
brainy president in a university makes everything
"go" from the ground up.
Omaha is getting too enthusiastic when it an
nounces that President McKinley will visit the ex
position and make a balloon ascension. The Presi
dent of the United States is a dignified gentleman,
not even remotely connected with the show business.
The Emperor of China is said to have lost his job.
Perhaps he can find work in some other capacity, but
the fact that he has been superseded by a woman
must worry him to a certain extent.
There is something wrong among the pugilists.
The big ones do not want to fight, which is not sur
prising, but some of them do not want to talk.
Spain hopes to retain the Philippines, but for what
reason is not clear. She never knew what to do with
them when she had them.
Esterhary ought to quit prating of his honor. Let
him talk about a guilty conscience or something else
he really has.
It is understood that 31anco did not join in the
shouting when the American flag was hoisted over
Havana.
Of late the Duke of Orleans has been exhibiting
violent symptoms of being a fool.
THE MAGUIRE OF RECORD.
JUDGE MAGUIRE has always been ready with
personal criticisms of other men, and always as
ready to resent criticism of himself or his
record.
His course in respect to all things but his own in
terests as an office-seeker has been tortuous.
lie began holding office and seeking more at a very
early age, and has succeeded marvelously in a salary
drawing career. According to one account he began
his official career at the age of 19- But there seems
no doubt that he began voting and holding office at
the same time. It is stated that he was drawing down
$75 a month in the City Attorney's office imme
diately after he served one term in the Legislature,
and continued until 1878. He was then admitted to
the bar and opened a small law office, which was
more frequented by politicians than clients. He was
elected Superior Judge on the Buckley ticket in 1882,
and held that office six years. He had not been in it
long before he began bolting the party that gave it to
him. His career on the bench was not marked by
any extraordinary service nor evidence of high ju
dicial ability.
Leaving it in 1889, he was in private life three years.
During most of the time his political activity was
against the Democratic party. When on the bench
he had bolted, put Hinton up for Mayor against
Pond, helped nominate Whelan as a bolter for Sheriff
against White, and Sumner for Congress against Mc-
Coppin. After this he withdrew formally and forever
from the Democratic party, because it would not fa
vor confiscation of land, but in 1892 he bolted back
into the part)' when a Congressional nomination was
in sight, and since then has been a continuous office
holder and candidate. At the close of his present
term in Congress he will be 46 years old, will have
been twenty-five years a voter, and from fifteen to
eighteen years an office-holder, and will have drawn
nearly $60,000 in official salaries!
There are some cases of chronic office-holding in
this State, but none that equals his.
He did not begin paying taxes in this city until
some years after he began drawing an official salary.
His first tax, amounting to $3 06, was paid in 1882.
Since 1882 he has drawn $24,000 salary as Supenor
Judge and $27,500 as member of Congress, and about
$3000 as mileage, making a total of $54,500, and for
the same period has paid in taxes $495 85. There are
not many men who in the same period have taken as
much out of the public treasury and put as little back
in taxes.
Nor are there many men who have as persistently
turned against the party which has put them in office.
He was never elected on any but a Democratic
ticket, and he has never scrupled to knife the ticket
when it suited him. To him and his friends is due
the defeat for Congress of Hastings, McCoppin and
Ferral. They knifed Clunie and fought Pond, and
now the whole gang of bolters, Maguire, Hinton,
Earry and all, are themselves "regular" fusion can
didates and are demanding the support of the party
which they never supported unless they were candi
dates!
MR. BYNUM'S fIDVICE.
\A R. W. D. BYNUM, who has recently resigned
/ \ the chairmanship of the national committee
of the sound money Democrats, has given tc
the members of that organization some sound advice
as to the course they should follow in this campaign.
He points out that all signs lead to the conclusion
that unless the fused Silverite and Populist factions
are thoroughly beaten this year they will take com
plete control of the Democratic party, and two years
from now will reaffirm the Chicago platform and re
nominate Bryan.
From these premises, which are hardly to be dis
puted, Mr. Bynum draws the conclusion that it is the
duty of all gold Democrats to assist in utterly de
feating the Bryanites, and to do this he declares
tnere is no other way than that of supporting the
Republican tickets. To give an ineffective vote to
independent candidates, or to refrain from voting at
all, would be an indirect support to the fiat money
fusionists. The only power capable of maintaining
sound money in this country, and of completely
crushing the fiatists, is that of the Republican party,
and all who favor honest finance must vote for that
party and its candidates.
While the fusion candidates are saying but little of
the silver question in this campaign and are endeav
oring to lead the pubiic away from it and all other
national issues, there are abundant evidences that they
are still wedded to Bryamsm, and that if by their
evasive trickery they can attain any kind of success
in the coming elections they will use all the power,
prestige and influence it gives them to strengthen
the silver factions for another disturbing and harass
ing campaign on the financial issue two years from
now.
The matter is one that concerns the largest busi
ness interests of the nation. Upon the stability of
our monetary system and the firmness of our credit
as a nation depends our commercial and industrial
prosperity. The silver agitations of the past seriously
injured almost every form of business in the United
States. All sections felt the evil effects of the un
certainty caused in financial circles, and hardly any
class of citizens escaped without suffering either a
direct or an indirect loss from them.
The complete defeat of the Bryanite fusion is,
therefore, almost as important now as it was two
years ago, and Mr. Bynum is right in advising his
colleagues of the gold Democracy that the only way
by which that can be accomplished is for all sound
money men to vote the Republican ticket this fall.
Qarnegie's project for establishing a gun plant
to rival Krupp's seems feasible. There is no particular
reason why the German should practically have a
monopoly, and anyhow this talk of peace and dis

Krupp, unaided, will not be able to supply the de
mand for cannon.
The idea of establishing a whipping-post is not

CALIFORNIA COLLEGE OF COMMERCE.
"The College of Commerce will become the most important college connected
with the university," said Arthur Rodgers while discussing this new and notable
institution which had its birth at the opening of the present college year.
California's College of Commerce has, in truth, every promise of a famous
career. There are three general warrants for this bright prospect. One is the
liberal and original scale and plan upon which it was begun and which alone in
sured it greatness. Now Miss Flood's munificent gift provides a royal income
with which its scope and work will be greatly extended. For another thing the
great commercial and industrial development in Pacific regions which has just
begun, and in the midst of which California will remain, will sustain an ever
growing demand for its men and its work and afford it an immense and fertile
field. We may well have faith and pride in its coming greatness.
The public has heard little or nothing of it since it really came into being as
the result of the enterprising pleas of some leaders in the business community,
and it is interesting to know how well it has started out and whither.
What the College of Commerce looks like a few weeks after its start is a
minor feature of its Btory, but one to which attention most readily turns. There
are about forty of the students of the university who have made it their major
course right at Its inception. It should be explained that all students who
have entered for this year's work have registered either as freshman or other
wise according to the entrance regulations. The College of Commerce pro
vided no special entrance examination, because it was in the formative state and
hence the old forms of registration have been followed. Only three students
have, on the register, entered as students of the College of Commerce, but
about thirty-seven others have taken up the course after entering as students in
social or natural sciences, because the entrance requirements invited such regis
tration. At its Inception and while In its formative stage the new college has
forty students.
One of the most interesting things in this connection is that two bright
young men have adopted the course with the. avowed intention of spending four
years or more in fitting themselves for consular careers. They have consulted
with Professor Plehn as to the special courses they should pursue to that
end. This is an interesting thing to note in connection with the apparently
forming demand for a trained diplomatic and consular American service.
These ambitious young men at the University of California have adopted public
careers as consular and diplomatic agents of the Government as their goal. They
heroically depend upon from four to six years of special training rather than in a
pull with some Congressman to get them the jobs they hope for. It is not a
matter of general information -that this has been attempted before in the course
of American history. , Perhaps it is a sign of the times as well as a sign of the
College of Commerce. A training for consular and diplomatic careers is already
one of the avowed and planned features of the wont of this institution. That
is only one of the respects in which it is an educational novelty among the uni
versity careers of the world. The University of California appears to be the
pioneer in putting forth university men trained for this public service as men
are trained to be engineers and lawyers.
Other students in the course contemplate railroad careers, a hardly less inter
esting phenomena and a not less natural one in this age of the competition of
brains. Banking and other business careers are goals for others among the forty
ambitious.
But the things of most important Interest are the plan, scope and hope of the
institution. It is yet' in 'its early formative stage. Its executive head is Profes
sor Plehn, who occupies the chair of economics at the university. He is a
man of ability and reputation and is the author of text books in economics in use
in important Eastern educational institutions. He haÂ« prepared the course of
Btudy as far as it has progressed and rules the institution under the supervision
of the Board of Regents and especially of Arthur Rodgers and J. B. Reinstein,
who take a keen interest in it. Like all the colleges of the university, except the
"professional" ones, it is an integral part of the university and students for the
most part pursue studies common to all the students, the difference being in the
synthesis of the courses. These general courses, however, are being modified and
enlarged for adaptation to the College of Commerce. The only absolutely new
chair that has been created so far is that of geography, which is occupied by
Professor Georfce Davidson.
This College of Commerce stands alone in the world as the only one that ex
ists on a university plane. Germany Is in the lead in this sort of education, and
is developing it in a masterly and successful way. But the German institutions
â  for training young men for business. Industrial and consular careers exist rather
on the plane of high school?. The College of Commerce of the University of Cali
fornia presumes that students who enter it have mastered bookkeeping, elemen
tary mathematics, stenography, etc., etc., including a considerable knowledge of
modern languages, and begins on the higher planes of university work, proceed
ing also to higher ends than any other institution. This is part of its initial great
ness and glory. It is in advance of anything else of the kind on earth as in to
that degree a new thing In the educational world.
The course as provisionally outlined would take much space to describe in de
tail. Ethics and civil polity are prominent. The legal studies Include interna
tional, admiralty, Roman and corporate law, the commercial and constitutional
law of different nations, etc., municipal government, the legislative control of in
dustry-and commerce, and so on. There is the history of commerce, private
property, land tenures, agriculture. Industry, labor, etc., In all times and lands.
The entire usual field of political economy is included. There are technological
studies, involving botany, forestry, the products of field, orchard, mine, manu
factory, fisheries, industrial art and so on, even including engineering. Modern
languages are important features, and general culture is provided for. The pur
suit of geography is greatly expanded. This field included political and physical
geography, commercial geography, geodesy, biological geography, meteorology,
oceanography, navigation, etc.
The department of geography is, as mentioned, in charge of Professor George
Davidson. It keeps him hustling. He has a chance to get to his offlee about once
a week and he earns his salary. The trouble is, it is interesting to note, that a
professor of geography is a new thing in the educational his- ->ry of the world and
this first professor finds that he has to rather blaze a way. It may sound odd to
hear that there is no text book or manual of geographyâ that is, that the facts of
geographical science have never been formulated in a scientific and orderly way
as have the facts of geology, botany and other sciences. But that is Professor
Wavidson's discovery and complaint as he proceeds to teach geographv from the
university standpoint. A wealth of geographical information exists, but It is all
in scraps.
The secretary- of one of the great geographical societies of Europe recentlv
complained that there were no text books on geography except the tlementarv
school books, although he had charge. of Â£1,000 volumes. Including 75 000 title? He
had vainly tried to get Oxford and Cambridge to establish chairs of geograohv
Professor Davidson finds the university and local libraries practically bare of ge
ography, and he wants some rich man to give a geographical library
Amid these difficulties, Professor Davidson Is going ahead with an Interest
ing geographical course. He Is just now lecturing on the ocean currents winds
typhoons, etc., of the Pacific, and how they affect Its commercial highways His
course will include ocean cables, the kind of people in different countrieV ' their
wants, consumption, etc., and a long list of other topics In which the practical will
be bound up with the scientific. In many Ways not here suggested the colieee of
commerce will broadly fit cultured yountf men for business and allied career-? Â«nH
the Pacific regions will receive special attention. ana
But all this lecture room Work Is only part of what the College of Commerce
contemplates and what Miss Flood's gift will make possible and probable As the
College of Mines experiments with the cyanide process and other mining problems
and as the College of Agriculture makes ceaseless investigations of soils the
adaptability of plants and other agricultural problems and Issues valuable bulled
tlnÃ thereon, so the College of Commerce will go afield and while not becoming
board of trade, will study commercial and industrial problems about and across
the Pacific Ocean, both by collating information and by sending trained investi
gators abroad, and issuing bulletins giving results. As Professor Rising studies
the sugar in beets In certain soils, so may College of Commerce experts study the
wants, habits and conditions that govern the consumption of cotton goods
canned fruit in the valley of the Hoang Ho, the problems in competition by sea
routes to Asia, and thus exhibit the spirit of original research which is more and
more filling modern universities.
Miss Flood's endowment will be largely devoted to the College of Commerce
and It at once opens a still larger future. It has attracted alreadv much notice
among educators. The University of Chicago followed suit by creating a coiled
of commerce and politics, but it embraces only existing courses ami Lt college

LIVE ITALIAN COUNT
Ceasar JWerigfr of tlje House of
Ferrara Playing Character
Parts at tlje Jlleazar.
THERE is a real live Count at the Alcazar. Caesar Merighi Is his
name, and he has a chateauâ ln a fair state of preservationâ ln Fer-
I rara, Italy. Countless acres of olive groves surround the home of his
-*â  ancestors, where the nobleman hopes one of these days to install a
fair young American wife.
Count Merighi is the "character" artist of the Alcazar company, and
while the management unite in praising his talent, they respectfully are
forced to admit that the Count, who plays under the nom de guerre of
Montaine, does not, in the language of the da}-, know his business.
Many American papas, so they argue, have already gone abroad to se
cure titles, with husbands attached, for their daughters, and it seems a
sinful waste, not only of traveling expenses but time, when they' might
have secured the real live thing "right here at home.
Merighi looks everything a Count and an actor should. He Is tall and
slender, with a clean-shaven lace to match his figure, while little eyes,
with a far-away expression, and a mouth that recalls the Juice of the Fer
rara olives lend to his physiognomy a rare nobility of cast.
Merighi has a large stock of medals and decorations, won by his dis
tinguished papa Count in the siege of Rome, as well as the many other
necessary et ceteras that go with the genuine noble article.
Merighi pere came over with Kossuth to fight against Maximilian in
Mexico, and after the siege, while enjoying the fruits of his successes, he
met Miss Caroline Frost of Philadelphia, the daughter of the noted his
torian and sister of the well-known artist, A. D. Frost. It was a case of
love at firsi sight, with the pleasant result that the Phlladelphian beauty
became the wife of the Italian soldier.
The present heir to the Merighi title and estates is In sentiment a true
patriot of the country of his mother's and his own birth. He speaks with
veneration of his ancestral possessions, but confesses that should an op
portunity present itself he might be induced to part, for a consideration,
with his chateau and olive groves.
Merighi, otherwise Montaine, is a playwright as well as an illustrator
of no mean ability. The latest work from his pen, "The Old Landmark,"
is shortly to be produced at the Alcazar.
Montaine's contract at the Alcazar is for sixteen weeks, and according
to the way that things at present look, the heiress who wants him would
better speak quickly.
MONGOLIANS
DETECTED IN
RANK PERJURY
Scheme of L. Quong
Frustrated.
JUDGE HEACOCK'S VIGILANCE
NEATLY TRAPPED A PROFES
SIONAL PERJURER.
Instead of Sleeping in a Pagoda
He Lodged With the
Family Cow in
China.
T.'nltc-d States Commissioner Heacock
put down his foot yesterday on a daring
attempt to land a young coolie by means
of perjury. '
Loul Foo Ok was the youth of 18 sum
mers or thereabouts. He alleged that he
was a native of San Francisco, and as
such was entitled to land. He was repre
sented by J. J. Quinn, the partner of
Thomas D. Riordan. Mr. Quinn had by
his side as silent partner Louis Quong,
president and treasurer of the Coolie Im
porting Bureau.
Quong is the Chinaman suspected of
being connected with the recent leakage
of Important testimony out of the Chinese
Bureau. Mr. Querns sports a hundred
dollar diamond ring and a pair of valu
able jade bracelets, and is a close com
panion of Lawyer Quinn, who, by the by,
is a close companion of the Chinese Bu
reau.
Loui Foo Ok, the boy, was placed on the
stand, and after he had repeated the
story taught htm on board ship to the ef
fect that his father and mother took him
back to China when he was too young to
remember anyuiing about San Francisco,
was asked by Commissioner Heacock to
draw a plan of the house In which his
parents lived in China. The boy did so,
and marked the rooms occupit-d by his
father and mother and the room occupied
by the family cow. The boy and his
uncle slept In a pagoda temple near by.
The uncle had been excludeo from thÂ«
courtroom while the boy was testifying
and when he took the witness stand told I
his etory glibly as to having been present
at the birth or the youth and having lived
in the same house with t.e family in Chi
na after their return thither.
Then the Commissioner requested the
uncle to draw a diagram of the house in
China. The witness did so and marked
one of the rooms as occupied by the boy's
father and mother, another room as oc
cupied by the boy and another by him
self. He had designated as his room the
one occupied by the family cow, and
seempd unaware of the existence of any
temple in the neighborhood.
"That will do." said the Commissioner.
"There will be no use in calling any more
witnesses. I have not the slightest doubt
that this case is a fraudulent one."
"Get out of here as quick as you can,"
said Louis Quong in Chinese to the uncle.
That worthy retired from the courtroom
and the building- with a nimbleness that
detracted much from the dignity of the
fat rascal who had hired himself out as a
professional perjurer.
Loui Foo Ok will .be deported.
A NINETEEN HUNDRED CLUB.
Members Will Prepare Themselves
for a Visit to the Exposition.
A rrifeting of great Interest to students
of languages was held last evening at
the office of Dr. J. M. Simpson, Y. M.
C. A. building, at which a preliminary
organization was effected, having for !t3
object the study of the French language
under the direction of a competent
French teacher and, second, the bringing
together of a number of persons who de
sire to visit the Paris Exposition in tne
year 1900.
The club proposes to have a clubroora
wfcÂ« re meetings will be held for 'esaons
and oonvi rsations in French, where will
be keot French books and different
French periodicals, such as Figaro, and
alr-j in riodicals published in French with
Knglfhh translations for students.
This club has some interesting and
novel features, one of which is the use
of the graphophone for home study, and
also in the clubroom. The lessons, after
they have tten given by the teacher, will
be dictated to the graphophone. Pupils
car then either take the lesson nome,
where they can listen to it repeatedly In
the voice of the teacher, or they can visit
the c'ubroom at any hour of the lay or
evening, where they can listen to it on
the club's instrument, fixing their accent
by constant repetition.
The club will also correspond with tho
Palls Exposition, hotels, railroads, steam
ship lines, etc., with a view to obtaining
full Information and special rates for its
members who desire to visit Parts during
the exposition, or at any time.
The following committee on organiza
tion was appointed, with Instructions to
call a larger meeting next Thursday
evening, when the full plan of organiza
tion will be reported: Temporary chair
man. Charles Freeman Johnson; tempo
rary secretary, Mrs. E. P. Jordan; Mrs.
Harriet C. French. Mrs. Nellie Holbrook
Bllnn, Dr. J. A. Simpson. W. E. Little.
A meeting will also be held at the Y.
M. C. A., Oakland, this evening, for the
purpose of forming a German section of
the 1900 club.
This Week's Wasp.

THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1898.
DAVIS LOVED
NOT WISELY
BUT TOO WELL
A Divorce Suit in the
Oakland Courts.
A WEST BERKELEY SENSATION
MBS. DAVIS' TALE OF TROUBLE
AND DESERTION.
She Accuses Miss Etta Johnson of
Luring Her Husband
Away From v
Her.
The loves and woes of Davis the
plumber are Just now the prevailing
topic in West Berkeley. Mrs. Davis Is
suing In the Oakland courts for a di
vorce, and Davis is not making much of a
contest, but West Berkeley is competent
to give the court points on the testimony.
So it does not have to wait for the court
records to supply it with the gossip of
the case.
Mrs. Davis is asking for the divorce on
the ground of extreme cruelty, and it is
of her specific allegations, or the princi
pal one of them, that the neighborhood is
talking.
Mrs. Davis alleges practical desertion
and threats to do bodily harm, and then
she proceeds to tell of the luring smiles
of a fair young neighbor and how they
led the faithless Davis away from his
home and family and brought him finally
to court. He left her for Miss Ktta John
son, the wife says, a young woman of j
about 20, whom they had known for some
time. Kind neighbors were the first ones
who told her what was going on. She j
would not believe it at first, but finally j
she asked her husband. He told her there !
was nothing in the story, but when she
volunteered to go over to the Johnsons' ;
and ask them she says he told ner he !
would kill her.
But Mrs. Davis carried her story to the
Johnsons just the same, and from Mrs. i
Johnson she says she learned that Davis I
had been worshiping at his new shrine j
for three years, and that he did so be
cause he loved Miss Etta to distraction,
and would sooner die than leave her.
In the early stages of his affection
Davis had anything but plain sailing. It
is told of him that he once was caught
by the young lady's father, Chris John
son, who prepared to argue with him in
a way more forcible than polite, and that
Davis drew a revolver from his pocket
and handed it to the irate father, .eiling
him to shoot, for in that way only would
his daughter be free from the attentions
being bestowed upon her. His gallantry
must have touched the parental heart,
for nothing further was done in the mat
ter by the Johnsons, and Davis and the
young lady continued to be subjects of |
comment.
It was on August 30 last that the divorce
was filed, and Thursday last testimony
was taken by Court Commissioner Bab- j
cock. Mrs. Davis was there and told her
story, and then she called in Mrs. John
son. Mrs. Johnson's testimony was sealed
up, and so far has not seen the lighc, out
she declares her daughter's name was
not mentioned V- the court, nor was it
In any of the papers in the case. She says
the suit is the result of jealousy on the
INVITED TO EXPLAIN HIS REMEDY.
DR. FREDERICK W. D'EVELYN, Whose " Eaulsine " Discovera
Has Aroused Interest In the East and Who Leaves
Shortly on a Lecture Tour,
Dr. Frederick W. d'F.velyn, the local physician who has, after fifteen,
years of experimentation on the subject of alcoholism and its hereditary
bearing, discovered means of eradicating the habit, will, on the 3d of Octo
ber, leave for New York, where he will deliver a series of lecturea in tho
leading churches and halls of that city.
About a week ago the doctor received a telegram from Dr. Madison Pe
terÃ, the distinguished New York clergyman, asking him to deliver a lec
ture on his discovery in the Bloomlngdale Church. Tne doctor consented
and fixed the date for some time In October. A week ago Monday he re
ceived another telegram from New York signed "Committee," Inviting him
to lecture in the Grand Opera House on October 16; Dr. Peters' Church,
October 23; Dr. Savage's Church, on October 30. The message also stated
" that the Rev. Lyman Abbott would meet him on his arrival in Bos
ton and Philadelphia with a view to having him speak in both places.
Dr. d' Evelyn expects to be away from this city three months. Dur
ing his absence he expects to visit England and may extend his travels to
South Africa, as he wishes to complete a course of investigations com
menced* years ago. On his way East he will stop at Chicago and consult
with a number of leading physicians and ladles who have asked for per
sonal Interviews.
In speaking about his success In treating patients with his great discov
ery, "Equlslne," the doctor said: "In the course of my Investigations I ex
perimented upon the subjects with Equlsine, which is prepared from the al
coholic blood of the horse, and in treating my patients I have obtained very
favorable results. I am prepared now to make the statement that this
line of Interference, if faithfully maintained, is destined to Immune man
from alcoholic disease. My mode of treatment has been to first take the
Equlsine and prepare plaques, which are pieces of chemically pure paper.
These are saturated with the Equisine and afterward dried at a low tem
perature. The method of application is to first scarify the arm or other
part of the body. The plaque is moistened with a few drops of distilled
water and applied to the raw surface. It is then covered with a disk of
rubber and remolstened at the end of ten hours. It Is then left In contact
with the arm for three or four days according to the intensity of the re
action. These plaques are applied once in six days, and most cases will
require from six to ten applications. The results have been very satisfac
tory, the treatment evidently being constructive and not destructive, as I
have not experienced any unfavorable results even In the longest addicted
or even in the most emaciated cases."

A CALIFORNIA HERO.
E. E. Kelly of tfee Signal Copps Dis
tinguishes .Himself.
BETTER has been received from Manila telling of the brave conduct
Aof another California boy, who will probably receive a medal from
Congress for his meritorious services. He Is E. E. Kelly, now Ser
geant Kelly of the Signal Corps. In the heat of the conflict he car
ried the wire a mile and a half right into the Spanish entrench
ments, while the bullets fell around him like hall. Two comrades fell
beside him, one fatally wounded. For his bravery he was made a
first sergeant, which is the highest rank that can be conferred upon him
there. General Merrltt sent his name to President McKinley for "gallant
and meritorious conduct during the capture of Manila," and it is expected
that he will at least get a Congressional medal. Since the capture of
Manila Sergeant Kelly has helped repair the cable, and has had a hand
in nearly all the wire stringing In the town.

the jealousy she will say nothing.
In the meantime Mrs. Davis Is staying
with a friend. Mrs. Harms. She says U
her husband wishes to marry Miss John

way. . â

"it would be wrong for me to keep them
apart," and so she is going to get her di

finally compromised on $15 a month, and
one months Installment has been paid to
her but as soon as she received it she
had to turn It over to the court as fees

IN A CBITICAL CONDITION.
Mrs. Soledad Esqueda Removed to
the Receiving Hospital for
Treatment.
Mrs. Soledad Esqueda, the woman who
was so brutally beaten by her husband,
Miguel, was taken to the Receiving Hos
pital yesterday morning in the ambulance
so that she could be removed later to the
City and County Hospital for treatment.
Dr. Weil found her in a critical condi
tion blood poisoning having set in. Her
temperature was 104. It is probable that
her ante-mortem statement will be taken
by the police to-day.
The efforts maae by the police to arrest
Esqueda have been without success.
Detectives and policemen who are fam
iliar with the Mexican quarter have been
detailed on the hunt, and if Esqueda has
not left the city, his arrest is only a ques
tion of time.
When Judge Conlan learned of the
woman's condition yesterday morning he
personally urged the police to use every
endeavor to arrest the miscreant, but his
interest in the matter did not meet with
the encouragement he expected from the
representatives of the Chief.

A Pound Official Held.
Frank Tyrell, the deputy pound keeper,
who was sentenced to pay a fine of $200
by Judge Mogan recently for using vul
gar and abusive language, was yesterday
held to answer before the Superior Court
by the Judge in $500 bonds on the charge
of assault with a deadly weapon. He im

SUCCESS IS ASSUMED.
Great Returns Promised From the
Richter Benefit This Evening.
The entertainment for the benefit of the
widow and orphans of uie late Captain
Reinhold Rlchter, who was one of the few
to be killed in the battle at Manila, will
be held this evening In the Mechanics' Pa
vilion. Captain Richter, it will beVmem
bered, was one of the first to enlist when
a call was made for volunteers to go to
the front in the war with Spain, and
when his company was in action before
the capital of the Philippines he was at
the front until laid low by a bullet from
the enemy. As soon as his death was
announced his old friends in this city de
cided that the gallant officer's family
should be remembered in a fitting man
ner. A beneficiary entertainment was
deemed the most fitting recognition of Ins
valor, and every one approached on the
subject was only too glad to be able to
lend a helping hand. As a result the af
fair promises to be a success.
Those who attend will be amply re
warded, for the programme has been ar
ranged with care. The features consist
of a concert by the League of the Cross
Cadets' band, marching review by the
soldiers of the Kansas Regiment, athlnic
exercises by the Verein Eintracht, the
San Francisco Turn Verein and the Olym
pic Club, gun drill by the Naval Militia,
vocal selections by the Police Choral So
ciety and numerous other attractions.
Besides these there will be refreshments
served in the several booths, and the en
tertainment will conclude with a dance.
The chairmen of the committees having
the arrangements in charge consist of the
following well known gentlemen: Colonel
Thomas M. Cluff, executive and finance;
Colonel A. Huber, advertising and press;
Colonel George R. Burdick, entertain
ment; General R. H. Warfield, music;
General John H. Dickinson, reception;
Captain A. L. Siebe, refreshments; C. W.
Heyer, floor; Colonel D. E. Miles, treas
urer; Major L. S. SehmUt. secretary.
Rates on Orange Shipments.
There will be a conference of repre
sentatives from the Southern Pacific, the
Santa Fe and the refrigerating car com
panies at Los Angeles next month to de
termine rates on orange shipping. Some
very important business will be trans
acted in regard to the adoption of a new
freight tariff. The matter will be fully
discussed and fixed rates established.

all suffering women of the benefit I have
received from taking; Lydia E. Pink-
ham's Vegetable Compound. I can hard- .
ly find words toexpressmy gratitude for
what she has done forme. â¢ My trouble .
was ulceration of the womb. I was un-
der the doctor's care. . Upon examina-
tion he found fifteen very large ulcers,
but he failed to do me good. 1 took sev-
eral bottles of Lydia E. Pinkham's Vege-
table Compound, also used the Sanative

vised me to try it. I did so, and had

THE GAME SEASON
WILL
OPEN NEXT WEEK.
The latest intelligence from the small
army of anglers which departed from this
city last week for Eel River is to the ef
fect that the large steelheads have not
yet put in an appearance in sufficient
numbers to guarantee the anglers on the
river the sport they! had anticipated.
Some ten-pound fish have been taken
by means of trolling from boats, but "the
sport is nothing now to what it will be
in a few weeks hence.
Fly-casting for small fishâ say from one
pound to two pounds in weight â cannot be
excelled in any of the coast streams.
Catches of from forty to sixty a day
of pound fish is not uncommon and the
"pounders" afford gala sport as they are
game and "put up" a great fight.
11. Battu of the San Francisco Fly-cast
ing Club returned recently from the Gar
cia River, In Mendocino County, with a
party of friends. He is very profuse in
his praises of the fishing that is now to
be had on that beautiful coast stream
near its mouth. He advises anglers who
are looking for real good sport to pay
Point Arena a visit before the heavy
rains set in.
Al Cummlng writes from Webber Lake
that the lishing is rapidly improving and
that lie is at present enjoying a grand
outing in the mountains, among the
grouse and quail. Al says that Johnny
Coleman is a splendid grouse shot and
would be a "champion" if he only under
stood . how to "hold on" his birds so
that he could easily tind them when they
fall. In winding up a letter to a friend ho
write?: "Coleman is a wing shot and
that's all there's to it."
Striped bass are very plentiful along the
east shores of the bay, but, as they jour
ney in schools, it is not an easy matter to
locate their whereabouts. They frequent
the sloughs on the Alameda County side,
but, being migratory in their habits,
expert anglers have found it a difficult
matter to keep track of their meander
ings. The striped bass is also a very coy
nsn, and, on days when the water Is
clear, the capture of them by hook and
line is not an easy task. The best lures
discovered so far by "the diggers" are
eoft shell crab and clams. It is said that
bass, during the past few days, have been
very plentiful in the sloughs near Mount
Eden.
A week from to-day there will be a
hot time on marsh and field. The season
â¢when quail, duck and other game birds
can be lawfully killed will be inaugurated
by a great exodus qf sportsmen from this
city. Rail shooters will do well to re
member, however, that in San Mateo
County rail cannot be shot until October
15â that is. In accordance with a county
ordinance which also says that shooting
from a boat during high tide is prohibited
Rail-sbooters will also remember that
they can enjoy but one month of the sea
son. In Alameda County the State law
prevails.
Every inch of the Sulsun marsh over
which a wild duck can fly has been leased
by sportsmen. The aristocratic clubs,
such as the Cordelia, Ibis. Tule Bell, Teal,
etc., have m;idt,- the most elaborate prepa
rations to give the "quackers" and "whis
tlers " the warmest Kind of a reception
and doubtless there will be tons of shot
scattered on the marsh next Saturday and
Bunday. The sportsmen of Suisun are not
behind in preserves this year. They have
organized clubs ad libitum, and keepers
are employed to keep outsiders off the
mud. According to latest accounts, the
home-breeding TMrds are quite plentiful.
Sprig and teul are also In evidence.
The Olympic, Mira Monte and Kmpire i
gun clubs do not expect anything Tike
good shooting upon their respective pre- !
6erves until after the heavy rains. A iew ,
malard reed in the marshes of Sonoma i
but they generally put out for the up- j
river fresh water ponds before the rains !
commence to fall. Last year duck-shoot- j
Ing on the Sonoma marshes was excep- ,
tlonally good, owing to the dry season,
which Kept the birds within easy reach of i
the bay. If this winter is productive of '
much rain, local duck hunters will not
enjoy much shooting on the Sonoma
marshes.
The Black Jack Club will be strongly
in evidence at the shooting grounds near
Antioch on Saturday next. Director Gen
eral Lemmer states that mallard, sprig
and teal are quite plentiful and that the
opening day should be productive of toler
ably good sport.
Although many of the devotees of quail
ehooting cannot resist the temptation of
having a shy at their favorite game on
the opening day. It can be said with
safety that there are many en
thusiastic sportsmen in this city who will
not pull trigger on a quail until after the
first good rain. The uplands are exceed
ingly dry this year, and doubtless there
â will be many conflagrations started dur
ing the first week or the season.
It is to be hoped, however, that the in
terior papers will give credit to whom
credit rightfully belongs. Heretofore,
when a large fire was reported In any part
of the country within a radius of 200 miles
of this city the Interior papers flamed up
in scare heads, "Blazed by San Francisco
Pothunters."
Now. the local sportsman, aa a rule, is
far more particular when he enters a
farmer's land to obey the laws of the
commonwealth than his brother of the
gun and dog who resides in the country
towns.
The city boys can stand some hot shot
from the interior editors occasionally, but
they seriously object to being made a
target to be shot at each vear whenever
a big fire is started in tne country by
â bucolic quail hunters.
Johnny Orr has been tramping the snipe
patches of the Country Club for some
weeks past, and reports having seen but
few birds, which is an indication of a
rather late arrival of the "Englishmen."
Snipe heretofore have put In an early
appearance in the Country Club preserve.
It is not generally known that the Chi
nese pheasant and the Oregon grouse will
cross, but the following excerpt from a
Portland paper will throw some light on
the subject. It says:
T. B. Foster of the First National Bank while
hunting near Turner, Marion County. Saturday,
shot a bird the like of which he had never
seen before, and he has not found any one
else who has ever seen such a creature. It was
put up by the dog. In company with a Mon
frolfan cock pheasant, and was taken for a
pheasant. It appears to be a cross between
a Mongolian pheasant and a blue grouse. It
hns the head of a pheasant, with the red ring
around the eyes. The markings on the neck
and breast resemble those of a pheasant, but
laok the brilliant coloring. The back and wings
ore like a pheasant's, while the tall is consid
erably longer than that of a grouse, and not
eo long or pointed an that of a pheasant. The
bird Is henvier than a pheasant, and the legs
are devoid of the spurs wliloh are worn by the
latter bird. It Is a veritable curio, and Mr
Filter Intend* to have the skin mounted for
a keepsake. Chinese pheasants have been cross
ed with domestic fowls, but It is not known
â whether they ever cross with grouse or not.
Hunters have accused the Mongolian pheasant
of driving the grouse away from their usual
haunts and all other sortÃ of wickedness %ut
the "Chinaman" is the game bird of Oregon
all the same.
ALL READY FOR THE
SCHUETZEN FESTIVAL
The annual prize shooting festival of
the California Schuetzen Club will be
held to-morrow and Monday at the
Schuetzen Park rifle range near San Ra
fael. The whole line of targets will be
opened at 9:30 o'clock in the morning,
and, with the exception of forty-five min
utes' intermission for lunch, will remain
In use until 4 o'clock. The prizes this
year are as numerous and liberal as
usual. There will be twenty cash prizes
on the point target, ranging from $20 to $1.
Similar prizes will be given for the twen
ty best centers. Twenty premiums, rang
ing from $10 to $1. are offered for the most
red flags in forty shots. The shooting for
the honor of "king" and the king dia
mond medal will bo done on the German
25-ring target. During the past year this
honor has been held by D. w. MeLaugh
lln. In addition to the medal there will
bo nine prizes from $10 to $1 to be distri
buted. One of the most interesting
matches will be shot on the honorary
target, three shots to a ticket, and the
prizes to the winners will be over $1000
worth of jewelry, silverware, household
goods and other useful and ornamental
articles. Besides these, special 'prizes will
be shot for by the prize Judges and mem
bers of the press. As usual, first and last
bullseyes will draw $2 50 and $1 cash
prizes. The distribution of the trophies
to the winners will be held on Sunday,
October 2, at Schuetzen Park, when the
club will give a picnic. It la understood
that riflemen from all along the coast
will be in attandance on this occasion.
Circuit Court of Appeals.
United States Circuit Judges Morrow
and Ross have arrived from Portland, and
Judge Gilbert Is expected to-day. The
three Judges will sit as the Circuit Court
of Appeals, beginning next Monday.
GUERNEVILLE TO
HAVE A
WATER CARNIVAL.
At the annual convention of the Pacific
Association held last Monday at the Re
liance Club, OaKland, the following row
ing men were chosen on the board of
managers: S. J. Pembroke of the Ala
meda Boat Club, J. R. Bockman of the
Ariel Rowing Club. A. P. lothkopf of the
Dolphin Swimming and Bo >. ting Club, W.
C. Espy of the Pioneer Rowing Club, Ju
lius Morton of the Olympic Boat Club, A.
H. Schimpf of the niton Swimming and
Boating Club and J. D. Mahoney of the
South End Rowing Club. These seven
form t>;e regatta committee.
The regatta committee held a meeting
In this city on Wednesday and discussed
the Aquatic Carnival at Guerneville on
October 15 and 16. The course is very
Ijood, the water being from four to twenty
feet deep, and smooth, while the sur
rounding scenery is lovely. The railroad
will provide transportation for the offi
cers and contestants, and a tine pro
gramme of aquatic sports will be given,
including four-oared barge races, shell
and ouirigged skiff events, swimming
contests, tug-of-war, water polo and
races down two toboggans erected side by
side. It is proposed to give a ball on Sat
urday night, October 15, and to keep vis
itors amused and interested during the
whole two day.-.
S J Pembroke of the Alamedas last
Sunday picked up in the Oakland Creek
a University of California man, who,
with more courage than discretion, had
gone out sculling in a smooth-bottomed
skiff, though quite ignorant of the art
jf rowing. Though the University Boat
ing Association nas a boat house and
some good boats, little interest is taken
in rowing at Berkeley. As the Stanford
men do not row. it is not possible to meet
them on the water, and a good coach is
Peking.
The Alamedas hope to be well repre
sented in skiff as well as barge races at
the coming championship regatta. The
?lub is increasing steadily, from six to
ten new members being added each
month. Messrs. Pembroke, Maass and
Hinchrnan are the club delegates to the
Pacific Athletic Association.
The South Ends will enter a senior and
lunior crew certainly, and probably an in
termediate one as well, at the champion
ship regatta. J. Foley will be in the
senior shell race and R. McArthur in the
lunior shell. V. Koster and J. Lyons will
represent the club in the junior skiff
;vent. As the cyclists have a representa
tive among the Justices of the Peace, Al
Fritz thinks the oarsmen ought to be rep
resented also. The club has appointed a
:ommittee to procure a new barge. The
:ontract may be made at an early date,
iut the barge will probably not be ready
'or use until next season.
The Tritons have now joined the Paci-
Sc Athletic Association, their delegates
Delng D. O'Keefe, B. Coffin and A. H.
Schimpf; the last is on the regatta som
mittee. The club is prospering, and will
lave its barges and skiffs put into racing
;rlm. B. Coffin and J. Hil.iard, who is a
candidate for membership, will practice,
n skiffs. The club Intends to come out of
ts shell and to engage more actively in
skiff and barge rowing than it has hith
erto done.
Two Pioneer barge crews and some skiff
men are practicing regulariv. and an In
termediate crew may be formed to go to
the Guerneville carnival. C. Ochs has re
ceived the prize which he won at the El
Campo skiff races in July: it is a scarf
pin composed of two crossed sculls. The
Pioneers have a skin canoe which might
be taken up to Guerneville.
Owing to the death of T. J. Hopkins and
the absence of Bartman on the steam
ship Australia, the ra-ce between the Irish
and German barge crews will not take
place on the Dolphin Club's ladies' day,
to be held on October 30. One of the
events on that day will be a special 100
yard match swimming race between E. H.
Coney and J. S. Earls.
In order to test the speed of the new
barge a crew consisting of Fred Woern
ner, bow; T. R. iveenan, No. 2; C. M. Far
rell, No. 3, and T. J. Kennedy, stroke, will
row three-quarters of a mile against the
intermediate barge crew, the latter using
the new boat. The intermediate crew is
practicing two or three times a week. The
new oars which they are using are lighter
than those they have hitherto had, and
the men are not yet quite accustomed to
them.
The visit of the San Francisco oarsmen
to Astoria will probably result in the
formation of a rowing club there. The
new club proposes to buy the boats of the
Willamette Rowing Club, which are for
sale, that club having gone out of exist
ence. A boat house Is to be bulit on
Youngs River, and the car line extended
to It. The club will Join the National Ab
soclation of Amateur Oarsmen.
PLACER COUNTY TEAM
TO VISIT THIS CITY
An eleven from the Citrus Colony,
Placer County, will visit San Francisco
next month. They propose to reach this
city oh Friday, October 21. and to play
against the Pacific Cricket Club on the
following Sunday. Matches will also be
played against the Alameda and San Jose
clubs, but the dates for these have not
yet been fixed. The matches against the
Alameda and Pacific clubs will be under
the auspices of the California Cricket
Association. So far the Citrus Colony
men have played only one match (that
against the Alameda Wanderers at Pen
ryn on May 29 and 30), "under the
auspices" of the association, and will find
it rather hard to make up the five In
nings required by the association as a
qualification to compete for the Burnell
batting and bowling prizes. Several of
our local batsmen have already been at
the bat in association matches more than
the eight times necessary to qualify as
competitors for the prizes. B. R. Hogue
has been at the bat 13 times, J. J. Moriar
ity 12. F. Croll 12, V. Seebeck 10, E. F.
Musson 12, G. Theobald 12, T. W. G. Wal
lace 11 J. H. Harbour 10, F. Sewell 9,
J. J. Theobald 9.
The match Alameda versus City of San
Francisco, of which the first innings was
played last Sunday, will be continued to
morrow on the Alameda ground. San
Francisco having scored 132 and Alameda
74 in the first innings, the representatives
of San Francisco have a lead of 58 runs.
But such is the glorious uncertainty of
cricket that the relative position of the
two teams may be entirely reversed by
to-morrow's play.
C. B. Fry, one of the most famous all
round athletes that the University of Ox
ford has ever had, has played splendid
cricket this season for his countyâSus
eex. In thirty-one innings (four times not
out) he made 1604 runs, or an average of
69.40 per innings. Six times he made
more than 100 runsâ three times against
Middlesex and once each against Somer
setshire, Yorkshire and Hampshire. His
highest score was 179 runs (not out)
against Yorkshire. He did better this
season for Sussex than the famous RanJ
itsinjhl did last year, and quite as well
as the Indian Prince did in his best year,
1896. For thirty-five innings In first-class
cricket during the season C. B. Fry's
average is 54.95.
A. E. Stoddart's average for Middlesex
is also a very high one â 1005 runs in 22
Innings (three times not out), or an aver
age of 52.89 runs per innings. His highest
score was 157, against Leicestershire.
In bowling the most brilliant perform
ance of recent date is that of Richard
son, the Surrey bowler, who, in the match
against Warwickshire, performed the
"nat trick," and took four wickets in one
over. In the second Innings of Warwick
shire he took eight wickets for twenty
eight runs, and in the whole match fif
teen wickets for eighty-three runs, and
that on hard, true turf.

THE FIELD OF SPORT
SOUTH BAYS WANT
A RACE
WITH CITY YACHTS
The regatta committee of the Pacific
Interclub Yacht Association will meet
next Wednesday evening to wind up the
affairs of the Admission Day races, and
to make a formal award of the trophies.
The San Franciscos give a hop at their
clubhouse at Sausalito to-night. Kltter
man's launch America will leave the club
wharf at 11:30 p. m. to bring back visitors
who wish to return to the city. Commo
dore Dr. T. L. Hill cruised to El Campo
last Sunday to witness the Corinthian
small yacht races, and was conveniently
on hand to pick up the vice-commodore
of his club from a swamped and water
logged Pacific half-rater, which the flag
ship afterward towed back to Sausalito.
The weather off El Campo on the 18th
was so squally and blustering that the
Corinthians, instead of marking out a
triangular course by means of stakeboats,
made Red Rock the turning point for the
small yachts. The course was thus a free
run out and a beat backâ a not uncom
mon course at important regattas. The
Eostponement of the races from Septem

WITH SPOON AND FLY.
Anglers Who Had Good Success on the Garcia River Last Week
Returned Home Happy.
DOINT ARENA can be reached In a journey of less than two days from this city by steamer. Within two miles <
of the town the Garcia River meanders on to the sea, and now is the time for the lovers of the angle to give <
| it a trial with spoon and fly. H. Battu, George Dupuy and J. A. Tatjo have just returned from the happy <
â *â¢ fishing groundÃ, and report having had royal sport. <
4
weather, was somewhat unfortunate; only
one member of the regatta committee,
whose duty it is to manage races, was
on hand on the 18th, and the best that
the circumstances allowed had to be done.
The commodore and secretary had sent
out all the notices to yacht owners, but
could not Bet any yachts to act as stake
boats. Ella, Clara and Mignon dragged
their anchors, and Aeolus had two hooks
out. After the regatta the sloops Aeolus
and Clara sailed over to Sausalito, the
former having the yawl Dulce in tow; on
the return to Tiburon the wind dropped
and both boats had some difficulty In
making their moorings.
To-day the Corinthians take the cruise
to Vallejo originally set for September
17. The Pacifies, Enclnals and Califor
nias have open dates.
The sloop which F. Stone has been
building for Hobson of Honolulu will soon
be ready for her owner, who wants a race
against the Macdonough cup winner.
T*he South Bays would like to see a
race between the boats of the twenty-foot
class open to all the clubs. J. E. Auzer
ais' sloop Papoose, which has been
brought within the 25-foot class, ar
rived too late to have an opportunity of
trying her speed on Admission day. But
interesting as such a race would be. it
is somewhat doubtful whether, with lit
tle more than a month of the yachting
season remaining, owners can be per
suaded to get their boats into racing
trim again. The South Bays had a
ladles' day last Sunday, and have a
cruise to Dumbarton Point to-morrow.
When their boats have been laid up
for the winter several of the San Fran
cisco yachtsmen will kick a pigskin for
exercise. At a meeting of the Vampires'
Association Football Club, held last Mon
day evening, Vice-Commodore O. T. S.
White was elected captain, Treasurer It.
B. Hoeue a vice-president, and Measurer
J. M. Punnett a member of tbÂ© executive
com mllUa.
ECHOES FROM
THE
GRIDIRON FIELD.
A week from to-day the initial football
game of the season will be played on the
Recreation grounds between the Olym
pics and the team representing the Uni
versity of California. The Olympics will
begin their training to-morrow morning;
the California athletes have been at work
on the gridiron for a month and are in
pretty fair condition for this time of the
season.
On Monday night there was a gathering
of football men in the club house on Post
street for the purposes of formation and
organization. It did not need much can
vassing to elect Pete Smith captain of
the team this year. Hardly had the men
present been informed that an election
of captain was in order when forthwith a
captain was elected by acclamation.
Douglas Erskine, tackle on the victorious
Olympic team of 1596, was elected vice
captain to serve in the advent of Smith
being disabled or being forced to with
draw from the same for other reasons.
George James became manager by ex
officlo right. He is the captain of the
club and a member of the board of man
agers and as such will be the point of
contact between the players and the
board of directors.
California has the advantage of training
over their club rivals. At Berkeley Coch
ran has been at work, with the exception
of a week's rest, drilling the men in the
preliminary practice. The Blue and Gold
contingent recommenced their practice
last Monday and have been at it ever
since. The Olympics are all tried players,
many of whom have lined up shoulder to
shoulder In a season's battles. This will
be to their advantage and will In a meas
ure offset the other disabilities. There is
a great deal of the problematic in the de
termination of the Olympic formation.
Sheehy, the great guard, will probably be
tried as half-back on account of the scar
city of good back material. Hobbs will be
tried at center or at right guard, the final
placing depending upon the approved
value of Ward, a Columbia college man.
or Bandy at center. Sexton, Erskine and
Nelson will try for tackles. Code will
probably not play with the Olympics this
year, who will. In consequence, suffer a
great loss. Roy Weldon will try for quar
ter back. The Olympic team will be ex
ceptionally heavy as Weldon is the light
est man on it. Back of the line King,
the full back of Santa Clara team of last
year, will try for half. Faw and Le Bal
lister will be the other candidates for po
sitions back of the line. Altogether the
Olympics should have a pretty strong
eleven, but they will suffer from a lack
of team play in the early games. But the
college eleven are not too strong in this
respect.
At Berkeley the new center trio which
has been practicing together is Greisberg,
center; Cadwalader. right guard and
Athern, the freshman, left guard. A
great deal of attention is being bestowed
upon this trio and It Is very likely that
they will form the center of the line. At
Stanford everything is in a tentative state
awaiting the arrival of Coach Cross, who
â¢waj ejected a few days asro.
NOTES AND GOSSIP
FROM
THE DIAMOND.
Tif Krelling, Arctic explorer, gold
chaser, athlete and devotee of baseball,
is in our midst once again.
Tif has spent over a year In the Klon
dike country, with the Intention, I am
told, of forming a ball league, and, fail
ing, owing to the lack of material, has re
turned to renew,' with Intense energy, the
art of instilling confidence into the hearts
of Manager Coffrath's "tin finishers."
The Sand Crabs,, after much worry and
a little money, have secured the perma
nent services of famed Pitcher Borchers.
Mr. Campbell of Stockton extended
every possible means which would enable
him to hold this much-sought individual,
but the fates smiled seawardly, and the
astute manager had to give way.
Monahan's sensational mishaps, while
playing at third base on Sunday last, con
tinue to be the topic in baseball circles.
He, however, plays rather steady ball
when some of his cohorts are taken into
consideration.
Jimmie Hughes is at it again. Yester
day the Chicagos fell down before his
cleverness, making but three hits.
The race between Boston and Baltimore
certainly Is Interesting, and, with just a
little luck, the latter team will come out
with flying colors. They are better pro
vided with pitchers than their opponents
having In Hughes, Maul and McJames
three of the best twirlers in the league
Boston has but one pitcher their equal
and it will be interesting to note that he
is expected to win the pennant for Bos
ton. He may do it, as he has in seasons
past, but if Baltimore ever catches them
as they did last year it is $20 to $1 they
win the flag. During the last aeries with
Boston in '97, Baltimore had #ot a pitcher
strong enough to work. They will have
three, one almost as good as the other
this year and should win easily if the
fates are generous enough to allow them
to catch up with the leaders.
To-day's game will be between the QJlt
Edges and Sand Crabs. That it will be
the greatest game of the season may be
Judged from the fact that the crack
twirlers, Harney and Borohers, are pitted
against each other. Come one and all and
root.
The line up is as follows;
Gilt Edge. Positions. Santa Cnut
Harvey .Pitcher Borchers
Stanley Catcher Daubenbia

BAY CITYS AND
OLYMPICS
BURY THE AX.
The Olympic Club Wheelmen and the
Bay City Wheelmen will have a joint run
to-morrow which promises to be the ban
ner event of its kind of the year both in
point of numbers and picturesqueness of
the Journey. Their destination will be
Mission San Jose, where they will be the
guests of their fellow memoers, Messrs.
Gallegos, Montealegre and Salazar. The
wheeling contingent of the party will take
the train to Haywards and ride the rest
of the way, about 12 miles. The infirm,
who cannot cycle that distance without
extreme fatigue and lassitude, have been
provided for, too. They will take the 8:30
a. m. boat and train to Niles, wnence they
will be "coached" down to the picnic
grounds behind gayly caparisoned steeds.
It was roughly estimated last night that
each club will turn out 75 men on this
run, so the attendance will be unusually
large. Swimming, baseball and other
outdoor amusements will be indulged In,
and a merry time is assured. The "hatch
et," which has so long kept severed the
string of peaceful relations between the
two clubs, will be buried with tittlng cere
mony, and it is hoped will never be resur
rected.
As stated exclusively In The Call last
Saturday, the Olympics and Bay Cltys
contemplate holding a joint race meet at
Elmhurst within the next two months.
Bach club has appointed a committee of
15 members, who will meet next Wednes
day night at the Olympic Club to arrange
particulars.
It is a pleasure to note the prevailing
feeling of friendliness between the Olym
pic Wheelmen and the Bay City Club, as
evidenced by last Sunday's road race, to
morrow's joint run and the coming race
meet to be handled by the two clubs.
This is as it should be, and with two such
powers combined the sport should flour
ish on the coast.
The newly elected directors of the Bay
City Wheelmen met Thursday r-ening
and elected the following officers for the
ensuing term: Emil Fahrbach, presi
dent; Henry L. Day, vice president; E. N.
Creigh, secretary'; Archibald Reid, finan
cial secretary; Theodore C. Dodge, treas
urer; A. J. Menne, captain; Frank H.
Kerrigan, Frank H. Watters, Dr. E. T.
Mervy, Harry Larkin and H. W. Spald
ing, directors. The retirement of Judge
Kerrigan, who has held the presidency
for four successive terms, was received
with regret by the other members of the
board, who urged him to accept re-elec
tion, but he declined. Emil Fahrbach, the
new president, was president of the club
for two terms twelve years ago. He is an
old-time wheelman, with an unconquer
able love for the sport, and should make
a splendid commanding officer for the
club. The other officers are old members
of the directorate, who have served faith
fully and been re-elected, save Secretary
Creigh, ttho Is new in the administration.
The Bay fc City members are promised
many innovations in social and wheel life
under the new board. To make the club
house more of a place of rendezvous for
the members will be one of its first ef
forts. Fortnightly Saturday evening en
tertainments and card tournaments will
be promoted, and club road races will
help to bring out any latent racing talent
that is undeveloped. In these and vari
ous other ways membership in the club
will be prized and new men will be at
tracted. If half the innovations proposed
by the new board are followed out the
club has before it a lively season.
A match race at ten miles between two
teams of young riders will be held next
Sunday week at San Leandro. The teams
are Rhodes, Hammer, Rusher, Bozio and
Carroll, captained by the latter, and Ped
lar, Davidson, Krager, Bowers and Rei
ser, captained by Harry Fowler. Each
contestant will ride a relay of two miles.
Hardy Downing has returned from the
North, accompanied by W. B. Ogle, a
well known wheelman of Portland.
The next meeting of the C. A. C. C. will
be held Saturday evening, October 1, at
the rooms of the California Club.
A great many racing men are in train
ing for the annual ten-mile handicap of
the C. A. C. C. on Sunday, October 9, from
Frultvale to Haywards.

JUDGE CONLAN THANKED
BY THE MASTIFF CLUB
The past week nas been one of unusual
activity among the dog clubs of the
coast. A call has been issued for a meet-
Ing to be held at the Occidental Hotel on
the 29th lnst. to consider the present con
dition of kennel affairs and to take such
action as my be deemed advisable.
In consequence of this call the San Jose
Kennel Club and the Collie Club of Cali
fornia both held meetings at San Jose last
Sunday, and both passed resolutions ap
pointing delegates and Instructing these
to vote In favor of the formation of an
independent coast league. C. R. Harker
and Norman J. Stewart will represent the
San Jose Club and H. H. Carlton the Col
lie Club.
The directors of the San Francisco Ken
nel Club were to have held a meeting on
Wednesday, but a quorum was lacking
and the meeting adjourned until this af
ternoon.
The star meeting of the week was that
of the Pacific Mastiff Club, which was
enlivened by the presence of H. T. Payne.
Two new members were elected and other
routine business transacted. Mr. Payne
obtained permission to address the club,
and delivered an able harangue upon the
advantages to be derived from a local or
nagizatfon, independent of the American
Kennel Club. The point on which he
scored most was the payment to the A.
K. C. by each club holding a show of the
fee of 25 cents per dog shown for listing.
This he claimed with some justice to be
an unjust, unnecessary and useless
charge. The secretary of the club re
plied at some length, warning the mem
bers against making a Jump into the
dark, and declaring against secession un
less harmony were guaranteed by suffi
cient authority being conferred on the
central body.
J. P. Norman was appointed delegate
to the convention, with discretionary pow
ers of action. It was Intended by the sec
retary that his action as delegate would
as far as possible be In unison with that
of the delegates from the San Francisco
Kennel Club.
Dr. d'Evelyn, the president, then ad
dressed the club, his speech being an
eulogy of Judge Conlan's denunciation of
the pound men's brutality toward their
canine victims. The following resolution
was ordered spread on the minutes: "Re
solved, That the Pacific Mastiff Club In
dorses the position taken by Judge Con
lan toward the ruffianism of the Pound
Master's employes, and recognizes with
pleasant anticipations the new era of re
lationship that has arisen between the
judicial authority and the Interests of
the canine race. It is further resolved
that the cordial thanks of this club be
and hereby are extended to Judge Conlan
for the noble humanity exhibited by him
in disposing of the case in question. The
secretary is hereby directed to Inform
Judge Conlan of these resolutions."
N. H. Hickman's fox terrier bitch has
arrived, and her new owner is delighte.l
with his purchase. George Bell has also
received two fox terrier dogs for the
stud, one smooth and one wire coated.
New blood Is greatly needed for the
breed on this coast, and Mr. Bell Is now
able to supply the demand.
Dr. Lougest of Boston has sold to S. H.
Miller of Baltimore for $1000 the peerless
and unbeaten mastiff Black Prince
Brampton, by champion Black Prince
out of Brampton Beauty. Black Prince
Brampton is beyond the shadow of a
doubt the finest mastiff ever bred In thi*
country. '

GETTING READY
FOR
MERCED COURSING
Coursing men are now turning their at
tention to the great outdoor meetings
which will be held in Merced, the first
of which will commence on November
15. It Is to be hoped, however, that the
officers of the clubs will see to it that
better eating accommodations will be
provided this year for the leashmen and
their friends who will be in attend
ance. The food last year was far from
being anything near good at the princi
pal hotels of the great plains city, and as
a consequence there are quite a number
of prominent coursing men who are in
favor of journeying on to Fresno, which
city has offered very flattering induce
ments.
Fresno should certainly be selected and
for many reasons, unless the Mereedites
improve on last year's rations, nut only
"at home," but on the field. Many dol
lars are scattered around Merced during
the coursing meetings in various ways,
but unh?ss there is some reciprocation
by which the vigorous kicks of the inner
man when he Is improperly treated are
appeased, other fields will certainly have
to be selected.
Tommy Hall, the prince of the Merced
coursing fraternity, has written to a lo
cal sportsman stating that although he
may not meet with good success in the
inclosures he is very positive of bagging
the long end of the stake this year's
open meeting with a few "scarecrows
which he is now preparing for cross-coun
try coursing.
"My coyotes," writes Tommy, "may be
a bit slow in getting away from Jim
Wren's leather rope, but after they will
cover a few miles or so and get warmed
up to their work they are regular ter
rors."
Tim Cronin, "the famous Pennie
slough jumper," has his eye also on the
big end of the Merced stake. Tim will
ship Thornhlll and the two recently im
ported dogs "from the old dart" to his
friend Hall to be trained for the gruelers.
Joe Golman of Merced will have Sar
castic in his string, and Mr. Fisher, also
of Merced will enter a ten-mile racer
from Chinese Camp. Hall is authority
for the statement that the tail of Fish
er's dog is "alle same Chinaman's tail."
It is said that a notable feature of the
meeting will be a grand barbecue pro
vided for the leashmen by Supervisor
Shaffer. Doubtless it will be done good
justice to.
During a conversation on matters that
pertain to coursing at a well known
sporting resort, B. Dougherty, of royal
buck fame, told the following story on
his friend, John Dugan of Newark:
"It was of a fine sunny morning in the
month of July about six years ago when
my friend Dugan heard two reports of a
shotgun within his fine coursing park
at Newark.
" 'What's that? 1 says John. 'Sure, it's
some thief killing your rabbits,' says I,
'and you'd better hurry up and stop him,
as he has surely found his way into the
breeding paddock and won't leave a hare
standing.'
"John started and so did I for the spot
where the shooting was going on, and you
never heard such shooting in all the
born days of your life. Man, you should
hear Dugan saying his prayers on the
run. I never heard anything like it be
fore. He was puffing like a steam en
gine when we got near the place where
the Sunday hunter was having the sport
of his life, and he says to the man with
the gun. 'What in the hâ are you doing
here?' The man with the gun turned
around when he heard John's voice and
said: 'Hush, hush! will ye? Get down!
Get down quick! the woods are full of
them! I've got a couple of dozen jacks
already, and I can easily knock out fifty
more if you fellers will only keep quiet.'
"Well, man alive, you should have seen
Dugan's face. He was tongue-tied; he
couldn't say a word for two minutes he
was so mad. Well, finally a big jack
jumped up near us and when the man
with the gun let fly two barrels at him
Dugan's tongue broke loose, and the fine
country air was red, white and blue for
five minutes.
"Well, to make a long story short we
took the gun away from the Sunday
hunter, which was afterward redeemed
on the payment of $25. But, boys, I
laughed so much over Dugan's misfor
tune that I lost my appetite, and it was
six days later when I found it again."
Atlanta Boy, entered by J. Foley. will
make his first appearance to-day. Dora,
the property of C. O. Holzhauer, is said
to be a good one. T. Moran has added
Royal Prize to his string. R. Dougherty
made an offer of $500 to Mr. Kenna for
the two "Bucks" last week, but failed
to capture his old-time stock. It is said
that the present owner has considered
the offer and will sell the "Bucks" to
Dougherty if Bernardo can be found.
Evening Star is a new dog that will soon
be seen raising park dust.
FOOTBALL KICKERS OP
STANFORD UNIVERSITY
The following letter from Stanford Uni
versity on football affairs is self-explan
atory:
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Sept. 23.
Compelled, as Stanford is this year, to form
almost an entire new team, a decidedly en
couraging feature of the practices up to this
time is the number of men who appear on the
gridiron dally. It is seldom that enough men
Ito make up four elevens are not out. Among
i them are several big and strong fellows from
I whom, it is thought, three good men for the
center can be developed. The most promising
candidates at present for center positions are
Biglow and Blanchard, who have done good
work on former second elevens, and Beedy,
Cairns, Anderson and Myer, who are new men
to the Stanford gridiron. All these men weigh
In the neighborhood of 200 pounds.
For the places at end and tackle all kinds
of good material has been out. Parker, Rea,
Smith, Rice, McFadden and Daggett are doing
the best work at end, and Rusk, Phil Wiison.
Emerson, Gray and Oilman are all showing up
well at tackle. It looks as if the backs will
be well taken care of with such men to select
from as Captain Fisher, Charlie Dole, Erb,
Hill. Burmeister and Geissler.
The first line-up of the season occurred Tues
day, when the freshman team lined up for a
few minutes' play against the first eleven.
Since then the freshman team and the second
eleven have been taking turns in playing
against the first team.
The freshman team will be in shape to get
Into rapid form as soon as Coach Cross ar
rives. The men have been working hard and
have made an excellent showing. A list of thÂ»
men who are trying for places on the "baby"
eleven and their positions is as follows: Ends,
Rice, Cone, Bowman, Cooper, Sell and Hamil
ton: backs. Downing, Bishop, Frisselle, Hough,
Rodolph and Geissler: center. Beedy. Anderson
and Cairns; guards, Rltter, Webber, Butler and
Keene; tackles. Gage and Bard.
In the first five months of IS9B more rain
fell in Kansas than during the whole of
last year.

Rev. Robert Roberts Suddenly Stricken With
Heart Disease.
T~\ OBERT ROBERTS, editor of the Christadelphian at Birming-
LJ ham, England, arrived in this city on the Alameda last Wednes-
I day from Australia and died suddenly yesterday morning in
â *â  his room at the Cosmopolitan Hotel.
Mr. .'.obcrts had purchased a ticket for New York by the
Canadian Pacific Railway and
i steamship ticket from New
Fork to j_.iverpool and was to
have started for Victoria yes
terday morning. He had taken
a bath and went to his room
to dress.
Shortly after 8 o'clock one of
the servants went to his room
to inform him that a visitor
was inquiring for him and
found his dead body on the
floor in front of the bureau.
The remains were taken to the
Morgue and a superficial ex
amination led to the belief that
death was caused by heart
disease.
The deau man had more than
a local reputation as a writer
and lecturer on religious sub
jects and was on a lecturing
tour around the globe. His
Itinerary found among his pa
pers shows that he had in
tended to stop at various
places along the route to de
liver lectures. This would pro
long his journey until Decem
ber 20 of this year, on which
date he intended to deliver his
last lecture of the tour.
The discovery of the death
was indirectly made by James
Cheetham, a salesman for M.
Friedman, the Post-street fur
niture dealer. Mr. Cheetham
promised to see Roberts off
and called on that mission, when he was informed of the sad oc
currence. Cheetham said he left Roberts last evening apparently
in the best of health.
Roberts had written several works, among which are "Christen
dom Astray," "The Trial" and "Did Christ Rise?"
An examination of his effects disclosed a number of medicines
used as remedies for heart troubles.
He leaves a widow and two daughters in Melbourne and a son
in London. The sad news has been wired to them and the remains
lie in Porter's undertaking establishment awaiting their orders.
REPORT OF
ADOLPH SUTRO'S
GUARDIAN
Tells of Her Father's
Last Days.
THERE WAS FEAR OF SUICIDE
OVER $700,000 INDEBTEDNESS
INCURRED.
During the Period of Her Guardian
ship of the Vast Estate the
Income .Exceeded the
.Expenditures.
Mrs. Dr. Emma Merrltt filed her re
port and account as guardian of the late
Adolph Sutro yesterday. She acted in
this capacity for several months prior
to his death, and after setting forth the
value of her services she asks that she
be properly remunerated therefor.
Mrs. Merritt presents a sorrowful pic
ture of her father's mental condition at
the time and alter her appointment as
Kuardiar. His helpless condition, she
says, prompted her to move him from his
old home to her residence. She took him
to her residence that she might the better
care for him. At that time the suffer
ing philanthropist was oblivious to his
surroundings, and often asked whether
he was in "Arcadia," his country home
fn Napa County. In this condition of mind
ehe feared not only for his life, but that
unless closely watched he himself would
end his existence.
The condition of the dead capitalist's
estate at the time he was declared in
competent is explained. The Heights and
the baths were handled economically and
were kept open as heretofore. The Cliff
House, managed and rented by J. M. Wll
klnÃ, she found to be drawing the nom
inal rental of $1000 a month. Wilkins was
also in arrears for rent, but she was un
able to enforce payment or to secure an
other tenant willing to pay over $700
a month. As Wilkins owned all the fur
niture in the building she saw that if
ehe ejected him she would have the build
ing left vacant on her hands. The mat
ter was therefore compromised, and Wil
kins now pays her $700 a month. In or
der to reduce expenses many employes
who cared for decedent's library were
discharged, and one man now cares for
the valuable property. She also found It
necessary to pay $42,000 out of her ward's
estate as an assessment on the stock he
owned in the Sutro Railroad Company.
She found many other difficulties in the
management of the estate. The debits
at the present time aggregate $690,566 82.
Of this vast amount $516,000 is due the
Hibernia Bank and $110,000 to the Nevada
Bank. Mrs. Merritt' s guardianship of
the estate extended from February to Au
gust of the present year. During that
period Bhe has received $87,743, and haa
expended on behalf of the estate $61,-
K2 22, leaving a balance of $26,490 78. Un
paid bills to the extent of $7652 57 In
curred during Mrs. Merritt's term as
gruardian are still outstanding, but these
account* will be adjusted in the near
future.

SAN MIGUEL, Manila, P. L, Aug. 25,
To the President of the Red Cross So
ciety, San Francisco â My Dear Madam:
1 have the honor to acknowledge the re
ceipt of a letter signed by you, as presi
dent, and by Mrs. \V. R. Eckert, as sec

I am certainly at a loss to fittingly ex
press to you, and the society, the thank
fulness of this command for the splendid
donation which will go far to alleviate
many of the hardships necessarily a part
and portion of a soldier's life.
Far less can I express to you the deep
feeling of appreciation we all have for the
kindness or heart and depth of human
feeling which prompted the gift.
Let me assure you that great as Is our
thankfulness for the splendid aid you
have given, it does not 'begin to meas'ure
our heartfelt appreciation of the kind re
membrance which prompted it.
The sum mentioned will be distributed
among the twelve companies, hospital
corps and band, as directed in your com
munication as soon as banks open and
exchange can be cashed. I have the
honor to be, very respectfully,
JAMES F. SMITH.
Colonel First California Regiment, United

WAS DESERTED
Made a Bluff at Shoot
ing Haynes.
WILKINSON WAS NOT IN SIGHT
COWARDLY METHODS "OF THE
ACCUSED OFFICERS.
Allowed Their Superior Officer to Ee
Shot Down in Cold Blood.
Further Hearing Con
tinued.
The "brave" officers who deserted Lieu
tenant Burke when he was shot and killed
by Theodore Park Haynes, the murderous
tinker, were again before the Police Com
missioners last night. Officer Marlowe,
one of the accused, was called to the
stand, and vainly endeavored to explain
why he had deserted his superior officer
when he was shot down.
According to his story, which he toid
under oath, Burke appeared on the scene
after he arid his fellow-officers had turned
tall and run. On being told that Haynes
had two revolvers, Burke told Wilkinson
to "stay back." He then approached the
cabin, and, encountering t"he murderous
tinker, told him he was an officer, at the
same time showing his star. Haynes or
dered him away, and as Burke refused to
leave, the tinker flred at him.
As Burke fell mortally wounded he
drew his revolver and llred at his asail
ant. Haynes again tired, and Burke feebly
attempted to shoot him, but did not have
sufficient strength to pull the trigger of
his revolver. The witness denied that he
had run away after Burke had been shot.
He claimed that after his superior officer
had fallen he retreated a few feet and
fired three shots at Haynes.
"Why didn't you empty your revolver
at Haynes when you saw him shoot down
Lieutenant Burke?" asked Commissioner
Tobin.
The witness replied that after he had
"shifted his position" he fired the remain
ing shots in his revolver at Haynes.
"After I had exhausted my ammuni
tion," he remarked, "I shouted to Mar
chant to 'give it to him,' meaning Haynes.
I did not see Wilkinson during the
trouble.
"Haynes fired a shot at me, the bullet
striking within a foot in front of me.
After Lieutenant Burke fell, Haynes re
treated into the house. I heard a peculiar
n*>ise, as if a shot had been tired, and con
cluded that he had committed suicide. I
at once sent a boy for more ammunition,
reaitzing that if Haynes was still alive
we would have more trouble with him.
"At this juncture I called to George
Casliel, the patrol-wagon d-river, and said,
'For God's sake get Lieutenant Burke
away from there.' He paid no attention
to me, and I called again. He then went
to the cabin and dragged Burke's body
away. Kennedy had a rffle, and he was
firing at Haynes. Detective Silvey ap
peared at this juncture, armed with a
rifie. As I was reloading my pistol, hav
ing received a fresh supply of amunition,
Silvey asked me to let him have my re
volver, as he was not accustomed to using
a rifle. I did so, and, taking the rifle from
him, flred at Haynes."
As Attorney Deuprey, who is prosecut
ing the case against the officers, was anx
ious to attend the Democratic convention,
further hearing was continued until next
Friday night.
TO OPEN WOLFS
DEPOSIT VAULTS
SUSPICIONS OF SARAH M.
PEIBSON'S HEIBS.
Some Irregularity Exists in the Miss
ing Man's Accounts â Friends
Scorn the Theory.
The heirs of the estate of Sarah Maria
Pearson are fearful that when the de
posit vaults of the First National Bank
of this city are opened the mystery sur
rounding the disappearance of John Wolf
of the firm of the Wolf-Wreden Company
will be solved. Wolf was administrator
of the estate of Mrs. Pearson, and as
such had in his possession, it is said, val
uable documents, stocks and bonds, and
other personal property which he depos
ited in the First National Bank. When
the heirs of the estate heard that he had
disappeared they immediately feared that
some irregularity in his accounts as ad
ministrator of the estate might be re
sponsible for his disappearance. In con
sequence they retained counsel, W. J.
Tuska, who made application to the Su
perior Court for an order directing a
search of the vaults to which the miss
ing man held the key. The order was
duly issued, but yesterday Reuben H.
Lloyd appeared in court and took excep
tion to the order on behalf of the bank.
The case was argued before Judge Troutt,
who, after deliberation, revoked the or
der issued. Another application will be
made, however, for an order less gen
eral than the one revoked and doubtless
the vault will be inspected.
The heirs are anxious for two reasons
to search the vaults. One to find whether
their suspicions are based on fact or not;
the other to materially assist them in
solving the mystery surrounding Wolf's
disappearance, for in event their suspi
cions prove unfounded and the accounts
and property are found to be correct the
theory of foul play will be greatly
strengthened. All of Wolf's friends lean
toward the theory of foul play, and state
that there is no ground for the suspicion
that some irregularity may exist in the
accounts. All of the moneys which have
come Into the hands of the administra
tor have been Invested in real estate in
South Australia and Tasmania, they say,
and no opportunity was afforded the
missing man to appropriate moneys or
other property had he so desired and
they scorn any intimation that any dis
honest desire ever occupied his time or
attention.
DIG FROM
THE INJURIES
SHE RECEIVED
Mrs. Esqueda Slowly
Sinking.
ACCUSES HER HUSBAND
HER ANTE-MORTEM STATEMENT
TAKEN.
She Feebly Tells How He Returned
Home and, Dragging Her Out
of Bed, Brutally As-
saulted Her.
Mrs. Esqueda, the unfortunate woman
who incurred her husband's displeasure
and was inhumanly treated by him, is in
a serious condition and may die. Yes
terday morning she wâ *â  removed to the
Receiving Hospital by the police. Police
Surgeon Weil, after an examination, gave
it as his opinion that she was fatally In
jured.
On learning that she was likely to die
Captain of Detectives Bohen last night
had an Interpreter take her ante-mortem
statement. It reads as follows:
My name is Mrs. Soledad Esqueda. I was
born in Mexico and am 30 years of age. I was
married by a Justice of the Peace whose name
I do not know. My husband has been Jealous
of me for the past three months.
On September 21 last he came home about 8
o'clock In the evening and started to abuse
me.
He threw me down and inflicted the Injury
from which I am pufteringf. He did this three
or four times, hurting me intensely. I wan
conscious all the time. He told me he would
kill me if I made an outcry.
Knowing that I am about to die, I make this
statement of my own free will.
MRS. SOL.EDAD ESQUEDA.
Notwithstanding the efforts of the po
lice, Esqueda st..i enjoys his liberty. Cap
tain Bohen, anticipating that the brute
will attempt to leave the city, has detail
ed several of his best men to watch the
ferries and railroad depots. An officer has
been stationed at his house, as it is be
lieved that he wll return, expecting to find
his wife there.
Esqueda's description as read to the
watchers of both stations last night was
as follows: Height about 5 feet 8 inches,
weight ISO pounds, light blue eyes, black
curly hair, light brown mustache; wore
a brown sack coat and light gray pants.
Captain Bohen is determined that Es
queda shall suffer for his crime.
"This is one of the most horrible cases
that has come under my notice for some
time," remarked the veteran detective
last night. "How a man could be such a
brute is beyond my comprehension. If it
takes every man in the department I in
tend to see that the fiend is landed be

Late last night the condition of the un
fortunate woman became worse, and the
surgeons at the hospital gave it as their
opinion that she could not possibly sur

LETTEBS FROM MANILA.
A Soldier Says That the Astor Guns
Did Not Work in Action.
When Sergeant Andrew J. Gaughran of
Battery K, Third United States Artillery,
was leaving this city for Manila he was
presented with a small silk flag by his
friend, F. J. Dougherty of the Custom
house. Gaughran wore the flag around
his neck at the battle of Malata, and sent
it back on the Alameda to the giver as a
souvenir.
He wrote a letter also, in which he re
lated some interesting facts in connection
with the battle, one being that the guns
of the Astor Battery would not work
when the attack was made on th.e Third
wing. The Spanish charged the battery
and captured two of the guns. The As
tors immediately made a pistol charge
and recaptured one of the guns, "but they
got pretty badly used up."
Surveyor of Customs Spear received a
letter from Captain T. J. McCreagh of
Company D, First California Regiment,
in which the writer states that the Cus
tom-house employes who went to Manila
as soldiers are in good health and expect
to be detailed to custom-house duty on
the islands.
MUTTON CHOPS HIS WEAKNESS,
Fred Miller, the "German Count,"
Gets Sixty Days for Petty
Larceny.
Fred Miller, an aristocratic-looking old
man, who is known as the "German
Count," was yesterday sent to the County
Jail for sixty days by Judge Mogan on
the charge of petty larceny.
Miller's confessed weakness Is mutton
chops, and he admitted in court that he
could not pass a butcher's wagon without
purloining the chops. Three months ago
he was arrested for the same offense and
got thirty days from Judge Mogan.
On Thursday afternoon he extracted
several chops from a wagon at California
and Laguna streets and took a passing
car. The driver of the wagon jumped on
the car after him, and they grappled, both
rolling on" the car to the street. Tne
driver clung to Miller until a policeman
arrived and took him into custody.

years old, by eight octogenarians, in

In the Divorce Courts.
Julius Silberstein was granted a di
vorce from May Silberstein yesterday on
statutory grounds. Suits for divorce on
the ground of desertion have been filed
by Ealar L/amar against Peter Lamar,
Sophie Flodberg against Andrew Flod
berg, Emily Curran against Maurice
Curran, and Charlotte Gray against
Thomas Gray.
Marie M. Wagner has been granted a
divorce from Ferdinand Wagner on the
ground of willful desertion. The com
plainant was allowed to resume her for
mer name, Mrs. Marie M. Dumont.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. Sept. 23.â There was only a rip
ple here and there on the surface of to-day's
market There were wide gaps In the list of
usually active stocks and the prominent securi
ties which moved at all did so In a sluggish
and hesitating manner and on a small volume
of trading. The bears seemed to haye the up
per hand at the opening and clipped the prlcu
of St. Paul a point in addition to the 2% per
cent dividend which was taken off to-day.
General Electric new stock. Sugar, Metropolitan
Street Railway and People's Gas all showed
declines ranging from a sharp fraction up to
nearly 1%. Sugar showed resistance anil drifted
back to the neighborhood of last night's clos
ing price. With that the market fell Into a
torpor, the bears being discouraged from fur
ther operations In face of the hardness of prices
and the easier tendency of the money market,
and the bulls being disinclined to renew the
campaign until conditions in the money market
became settled. Some reliance has been placed
upon the dawning interest in Americans which
was becoming manifest on the London ex
change as a help to the next bull campaign.
But New York's demand upon London for gold
and the consequent stiffening of the money rate
there, which went to 2 per cent to-day for
call loans and 2%@2% per cent for public dis
count. haÂ« broughf speculation in London to a
standstill. Americans have fallen flat there
along with the other markets. There were
movements in Individual stocks to-day, but the
market as a whole presented a waiting atti
tude.
Tobacco was weak and sold as low as 147%.
The mercurial New York Air Brake dipped 10
points and recovered 7 without any perceptible
influence on the general market. Chicago Ter
minal. EvansvlUe and Terre Haute, Central
and Southern Pacific and a few other compara
tively obscure stocks showed noteworthy ad
vances. People's Gas was up on the advanced
settlement of. the controversy . with the In
diana Natural Gas Company. There was good
buying on a small scale of the Grangers and
the Pacifies on the statements of earnlnÃa
Net changes in the majority of cases are small
and fail to reflect any general condition of
business.
The bond market waa extremely dull. Price
changes were Irregular. Total sales $1,500,000.
Government bonds unchanged.
Total sales of stocks to-day were 255,700
shares, including: 9205 Central Pacific; 6700
Burlington: 699") Manhattan; 11,000 Northern
Pacific; 17.485 Union Pacific: 11,825 St. Paul;
14.791 Union Pacific preferred: 7975 Cotton Oil;

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, Sept. 23â Evening.- Post's
London ; financial cablegram says: The stock
markets , here opened flat to-day on the de
velopments' In China. Argentines, were. espe-.
! daily weak on a pessimistic London Times
j editorial concerning the - boundary question.;
When the Information given in these dispatches
concerning Buenos Ayres buying became
1 known, however, a sharp rise followed, the
I foreign buying being backed up by Rothschild
purchases, and the prices of Argentines and of
Chile securities closed at the best. I am told
that private telegrams, received In good quar
ters, state : that a document providing for a '
settlement of the boundary question by arbltra- j
tlon has been signed. ' .
Americans opened dull on realizations :by
Ensllfh bulls In specialties as Erie, New York
Central. Ontario and- Western and Missouri Pa
cine. Louisville and Nashville was offered on
an exaggerated report of the weak condition of J
the cotton market. Subsequently NÂ«w York
bought Union Pacific, Louisville and Na*hvllle
and Central Pacific and the market closed
| steady. 4
I There is a falling off In the number of Amerl- !
I can â¢: bills offered for forward delivery. I am J

FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK, Sept. Bradstreet's . Finan
cial Review will say to-morrow: Irregularity
i has been 1 the chief feature of. speculation.'.. Pro- j
fessional , trading and manipulation furnished j
! the bulk of the activity and. the public Is hard- :
ly a factor, â  although commission houses are j
fairly busy. . London has bought a few stocks j
on balance, but .as a whole the market has j
represented a struggle â  between ball and bear j
speculative interests. In which the money mar-, ]
ket and the gold Importations have been used j
with some effect to Influence sentiment. The j
principal movements of the ' week, however. . ]
have been In stocks like Bugar, Manhattan, I
American > Tobacco and a few others, which j
have acted In accordance with particular, con- I
i dltlons or especial manipulation. The reduction
! of the New York bank surplus reserves to
I $4,000,000, shown by last Saturday's averages,
was followed by calling of loans early this
week and by 6 per cent call money rate. This
last, however, was only momentary, and not
only were assurances given by banking au
thorities that conditions were satisfactorily ad-
Justed, but as the week progressed the fall of
exchange rates and the engagement of $$,400,
000 gold In London for shipment to New York
assisted in bringing about easier rates for call
loans and a more confident feeling In regard
to money. This belief was not shaken by the
advance In the Bank of England discount rates
on Thursday and the sharp advance In Interest
In London, which would Indicate that opposition
will be offered to further large American with
drawals of gold.
Probably the most Important event of thÂ«
week wag the declaration of a half per cent
half yearly dividend on Union Pacific last
Thursday. Yet a portion of the street seemed
to be disappointed with these results, because
the company had earned in the first six months
of its existence not only 2 per cent for the
preferred, but something for the common
stock. Both the common and preferred sold
off on the announcement of the conservative
action of the management. Northern Paclffc
stocks were strong throughout the week. They
had excellent foreign support.
The Baltimore and Ohio securities were
strong early In the week on the announcement
of the deal by which Mr. J. J. Hill and a
Western syndicate acquire an Interest In the
road.
The industrials were., however, the active part
of the list, and the feature of the market was
sugar stock. Us break to 116% early In the
wppK was attended by liquidation of long
stocks and by reports that the trade war was
at last nenring an acute stage. The large short
interest created at the decline was responsible
for the subsequent rally to 183. but the stock
again reacted and has been very irregular and
sensitive In view of the uncertainty surround
ing the trades union.

DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK. Sept. 23.â R. O. Dun A Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade will say to-morrow:
Europe will have to consider possible American
needs for money much more anxiously In the
future. Doubtless there has been for many
years a feeling that the new continent could
not be put off with promises. But the control
of this country over money markets in the OJd
World is coming to be that of a master. Our
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1898.
bunks lend over there heavily when it ia the
most convenient market for them, but they
draw on Europe whenever they want money
and no longer have occasion to limit their
drafts.
This country Is not drawing on Europe as
largely to pay for breadstuffe aa it did a year
ago and wheat exports for the week, flour in
cluded, have been 2,963,204 bushels from At
lantic ports, against 3,677,868 bushels last year,
and 543.417 from Pacific ports, against 1.0y4.593
last year, making for the three weeks 10,203,941
bushels from both coasts, flour included, against
15,569,129 bushels last year. Prices have risen
sharply, about 4c for the week, and the exports
of com, though not as large as last year, have
been heavy in comparison with any other year.
The price is slightly advanced.
Reports from different cities disclose a won
derful activity at the chief centers of Western
trade, the dispatches from Chicago. St. Paul
and St. Louis being especially significant. To
Eastern dealers It may be hard to realize that
such extraordinary activity exists at the West,
although their own trade Is excellent. Even
In Eastern markets ft is commonly said that
no larger trade has ever been known, unless
In 1892, but the Western cities are running
things much after their own taste thle year,
having greater advantages than ever, before In
heavy bank balances, and while the exchanges
for the wee-k fall below those of last year 3
to 5 per cent they are 13.1 per cent larger than
In the same week in 1892.
The Iron and Eteel trade expands with a
rapidity which throws into the shade all ex
pectations, with a steel famine In Germany and
Great Britain in the market for 10.000 tons
plates and the American works crowded for
months ahead. New orders at Chicago cover
30,000 tons of tin plate bars, besides 7000 tons
sold at Philadelphia, Rails are In such de
mand that the makers are to meet with the
expectation of advancing prices, some sales
having been made from Chicago below agreed
quotations for delivery at the far West.
Plates are strong everywhere, but. on account
of car construction, especially strong at Chi
cago, and the demand for bars on the same ac
count Is heavy, with one order at Chicago for
1000 and several others for 500 cars each.
Prices have slightly advanced for plates, bars
and wire nails, which are in much better de
mand than heretofore.
Coke production increases, the output at Con
nellnvllle for the week having been 140,658 tons,
against 137,171 tons for the previous week, and
tin Is somewhat stronger at $16 15, reflecting
in advance at London, while copper Is quiet
Â«t tit BO for lake and lead comparatively ln
tctlve at 4c. Tin plates are selling at $2 82H
.'or full-weight Bessemer.
The copper production In August was 19.50S
tons domestic, against 69C9 foreign, and the lead
production, as officially reported, has been 166.
163 tons for the half year, against 259.59S tons
for the full year 1597.
Failures for the week have been 174 In the
United States, against 209 last year, and 16 In
Canada, against 28 last year.
BRADSTREETS REVIEW.
NEW YORK, Sept. 24â Bradstreet' s to-mor
row will say: Favorable trade developments
manifest themselves chiefly along the lines
previously noted. The Importance of a large
export demand to the country's domestic Inter
ests Is illustrated by the Improved tone and
prices of wheat and flour this week, growing
out of the better foreign buying, induced by
j less favorable Russian crop reports, smaller
! shipments from that country and apparently
j continued careful selling by American pro
j ducers. Raw cotton, on the other hand, re
j fleets probabilities of continued plentiful sup-
I ply and rather slow demand In quotations,
j lower than the lowest point reached In the
! year of depression. 1594, when a large yield
j was coincident with poor trade, Industrial
j troubles and tight money. From the Wept and
I Northwest advices continue largely In the
I former cheerful strain. Some retaliation in
I activity Is perceptible In some lines at large
j markets, but the volume of trade as a wohle
1 Is evidently equal to any previous record. At
I the South low-priced cotton and yellow fever
i quarantines affect trade adversely. Improve
ment in one section being counterbalanced by
! less favorable advices from others. Favorable
i conditions on the Pacific are most numerously
I reported In the States of Oregon and Washing
ton. Conservative management earlier In the
, year, however, has resulted In fairly good con
ditions in California, where crops were less
favorable than further north, and failures are
down to a minimum. At the East the leant
favorable reports continue to come from the
textile industries. Wool Is quiet and manu
facturers are not encouraged to buy heavily
In view of the very moderate trade in woolen
goods. Cotton goods are In better distribution,
but prices betray the unsettling influences of
low prices for the raw material, and print
cloths are slightly weaker. Activity In Iron
and steel manufacture continues unabated, and
similar conditions are reported abroad. Talk
of further moderate advances In prices has
Increased, particularly as this country Is the
cheapest market for Iron and steel In the
world. The export trade In pig Iron from
Southern points continues very heavy and an
other advance of 25 cents Is reported by some
large Southern concerns. An Improved foreign
demand for American cereals Is shown In the
enlarged shipments this week. Wheat, includ
ing flour, shipments aggregate 4,991,353 bushels,
against 8,675,291 bushels last week, 6,570,825
bushels In the corresponding week of 1897,
[ 3,930.466 bushels In 1896, 3.161.907 bushels In 1895
and 2,562,500 bushels in 1894. Since July 1 this
I year exports of wheat aggregate 41.160.444 bush
els, against 60,310,625 bushels last year.
Business failures In the United States for
the week number 182, against 173 last week,
compared with 237 In the week a year ago, 321
In }896, 198 in 1895 and 204 In 1894.
Business failures in the Dominion of Canada
number 19, against 20 last week, 35 in this
week one year ago and 34 in 1896.
DRIED FRUITS IN THE EAST.
NEW YORK. Sept. 23.â The Journal of Com
merce says: There Is an increasing demand
for all descriptions of California dried fruits
for forward delivery, but It is held by large
handlers of these goods at this end that busi
ness Is b<?lng restricted by the attitude assumed
by the sellers of the Coast. It Is asserted here
that the latter are not pursuing business meth
ods, however, by having organized different
producing Interests associations, and made
rules for the disposition of their stock. They
have, It is asserted, not given the considera
tion to large Eastern handlers that Is due the
latter as the chief distributers of goods not only
in domestic, but in foreign, markets. Very
much complajnt If heard regarding the action
of the rules of the syndicate In announcing that
prices will be advanced after midnight. October
8. The trade here who have orders for early
October shipment are uncertain as to whether
they will be compelled to stand the advance on
goods ordered bÂ»fore and shipped after that
date. A good deal of telegraphing has been
done with a view to making this point clear,
but people at this end of the line say that they
are unable to get any satisfactory replies. I
In a lesser degree Eastern commission houses
are having difficulty In getting orders for
prunes and peaches confirmed. In the case of
raisins. It Is said there Is no reason for any
uncertainty, as the stock is ample, and the
association has only to declare its position and
terms to straighten out the tangle in which
business has been caught. Regarding the prune
situation, it Is admitted that there may be some
reason for the present uncertainty, as the crop
Is turning out much smaller than was ex
pected.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. Sept. 28.- "eakneas was shown
by wheat right from the start. Prices at Liv
erpool were a disappointment to the traders,
that market responding feebly to yesterday's
advance here. Northwest markets opened at
lower prices. Opening trades In December were
made at 64Â®64Hc, compared with yesterday's
close of MMjiaiCJHc. There was a good dealof
realizing at the start by weax-kneed holders,
which made the market rather wobbly for a
time. An undertone of strength soon devel
oped, however, when later advices showed an
Improvement In the Northwest markets and at
Liverpool, but when the Northwest again be
gan to decline, which It soon did. the price
slid off atrain and to lower figures than before
December declining from 64%Â®64^c to 6STic'

YOUNG HEIRS
DECEIVED BY
A CIPHER
Rushed West to Get a
Big Estate.
FIND IT VERY LIMITED
BTURGES' LOST SISTERS HEAR
OF HIS WEALTH.
Many Attorneys Are Put to Confu
sion b-r the Arrival of a
Public Officer From
Michigan.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Sept. 23.
The misuse of a cipher in a news
paper has proved an expensive mistake
to two young men and an attorney from
the East, who have just arrived to claim
an estate left by M. B. Stunros. the old
Centerville pioneer farmer and capitalist.
Some weeks ago, when Sturges died, a
â will was discovered in which he left his
estate to his two sl6ters, Mrs. Lueretla
Crowell and Mrs. Eudosia Wilcox of
Michigan.
Twenty years ago Sturges quarreled
with these two sisters regarding his mar
riage, and from that time they never
communicated with each other. After his
tie i a . tl J. a re PÂ° r t of the will was published .
which stated that the estate was worth
about $100,000. and that the missing sis
ters could not be found.
This statement very quickly brought to
light the missing sisters, one of whom
lives at Adrian, Mich., and the other a<
Chicago. Each has grown children, and
when the prospect was held up of ob
taining JoO.ijw from their forgotten Cali
fornia relative, a son of each of them, ac
companied uy City Attorney Priddy of
Adrian, came to the coast.
When, the case was called in court it
appeared that a host of attorneys had
written to the absent heirs, asking for
an authorization to take care of their in
terests. Several of them had assured the
court that thoir authorization to act
would be received in a couple of days,
and then Attorney Priddy astonished
everybody by stating that he had come
from Michigan to handle the case.
Attorney Fred Whitney was appointed
by the deceased executor, and it was hia
unpleasant duty to inform the nephews
and their attorney ...at there hail been a
great mistarf.' made in the published re
port of the value of the estate. Mr.
Whitney informed them that the estate
would probablv be appraised at iS.OoO,
and that after the mortgages were paid
there might be $3000 apiece for each of
the deceased's sisters.
SAD CASE OF INSANITY.
C. W. Tappan's Mind Unhinged Over
a Train Wreck That Occurred
i '. -'. Sixteeen Years Ago.
OAKT.AXD, Sept. 23.â A most pitiable
case of Insanity was examined into by
Drs. TlsdaJe and Mehrman at the Re
ceiving Hospital to-day. The case was
that' uf Charles W. Tappan; 1 an ex-engi
neer; brother of the well-known Alameda
attornejvÃ- B. â -Tttypan. Sixteen years
ago C. â¢'\V. Tappan. "was an engineer on
the Oregon "Pacific. Railroad, and a train
wreck that .occurred many years since is
responsible for his present condition. The
accident unhinged his mind at the time,
and he has worried over It continuously
until recently : he be'oame very sick. His
wife took him ' to the country in the
hope, ot resuscitating him, but he refused
to tak<3 any medicine offered, and on the
journey' to his home In Alameda he at
tempted to chqke himself to death, by
tying a handkerchief tightly about his
neck.
He gave as a reason for this rash act
that detectives of the Oregon Pacific
were continuously hounding him on ac
count of the wreck (of sixteen, years ago>,
whidh he believes has just happened; that
no lives were los,t but much damage was
don!.' He appears to be in constant
dread. . ~. ...... . ...
After the Oregon "Pacific wreck, Mr.
Tappan â¢ was for thirteen years working
on a road in Mendocino County eight
miles long, and the monotony of this
short run is believed also to have affected
his mind. '
Judge Hall committed him to Napa In
fane A.Â«ylum, where he will have the
bestfOf care, as Dr. Gardner, the medical
superintendent there, is a particular
friend of the family. â¢
The unfortunate engineer is 52 years of
age and has a wife and several children.
He is possessed of an estate valued at
aboiit $15,000, and to properly look after his
interests his brother, R. B. Tappan, will
apply for the appointment of guardian.
Attorney Tappan is deeply grieved over
the Bad affair, and when he signed the
petition for the examination Bald: "I
would as willingly sign his death warrant
as this, but perhaps it is all for the
best/' '
Mrs. Kleigel Not Committed.
OAKLAND. Sept. 23.â Mrs. Sophie Klei
gel was examined as to her mental con
dition at the Receiving Hospital to-day
by Drs. Tisdale and,Knox, who concluded
that she was not Insane,' but was sub
ject to extreme-nervousness. - Mrs. Kleigel
spoke rationally at the examination. â  She
laimed that she is a victim of mistreat
ment at the hands of her husband, B.
Kleigel, who refuses to allow her to have
company and requires her to remain.in
side ' he house at all times. The doctors
were of the opinion that under kind treat
ment she would soon get -on nicely, and

GRAVE RESULTS
GROW OUT OF
THE LAST RUSH
More Students Called
Up to Explain.
FEUD FIGHTS MUST STOP
THE FACULTY EXPECTED TO
EXPEL OFFENDERS.
Freshmen Adopt Resolutions Ac
knowledging the Fault and
Promising to Be Good
Boys in the Future.
BERKELEY, Sept. 23.-^Just what the
attitude of the faculty of the University
of California is going to be toward those
students who took part in the ruÃh a
week ago remains as much of an enigma
to-day as when the college was first
startled with the news of the threatened
expulsion of four freshmen who had been
called before the committee on students'
affairs. Indications go to show that noth
ing will be done until the professors have
deliberated upon the matter for some
time. But whether expulsion be carried
out or not, It is certain that the ques
tion of rushing Is being settled once and
for all, and that hereafter there will be
a complete understanding between the
faculty and students as to the limits
within which the latter must keep
Henceforth the law of rushing will be
definite, and it will be known to every
member of the university, so that trans
gressors can have no excuse.
The fact that there has so far been no
such understanding between faculty and
students is largely responsible for the
agitation which the recent action of the
students" affairs committee has caused.
The men who are facing the severest
punishment that the university imposes
have at least the excuse that no tuch
thing was ever known In the college be
fore.
When tho Associated Students rescinded
their resolutions prohibiting rushing of
any kind, every student understood that
the only rule which prevented the old
tussles on the campus had been set aside
and that the way was open for the tra
ditional interclass feud without any of
the alarming consequences which the fac
ulty seem inclined on this occasion to in-
It would seem now that the committee
on students' affairs is trying to find the
men who are responsible, for beginning
the fracas which promises to become
historical in the college annals. That the
faculty evidently regards the matter as
one of very serious moment 19 seen from
the fact that the notices summoning stu
dents to appear before It are carried by
special messenger to their residences in
Berkeley instead of being placed upon
the letter rack as usual.
This morning seven more freshmen
were "called up," among whom were L.
A. Wimble, G. P. Fuller, M. Warner, D.
Smith, N. L. Stark and W. C. Robbins
They were questioned closely as to what
they knew of the rush and of the part
they took in It. Their cases were taken
under consideration, and they were told
to hold themselves in readiness to be
"called up" again at any time. It is ex
pected that as many more will be sum
moned to appear before the tribunal next
Monday morning.
The freshmen held a class meeting this
morning and adopted tho following reso
lutions:
"Whereas, a number of the members of
the class of 1902 have at two different
times participated in rushes, contrary to
the wishes of the faculty; thorsfor? be it
"Resolved, That we, thf members of
the class of 1902, acknowledge our fault
and express our willingness to arrange
an understanding between th-a faculty
and the class of 1902."
ATTACKED FURIOUSLY
BY A VICIOUS DOG
CHESTER RISTENPART NARROW-
LY ESCAPES DEATH.
A Berkeley Boy Bitten and Terribly
Mangled by a Ferocious Beast
on Channing Way.
BERKELEY, Sept. 23.â Chester Risten
part, the 11-yoar-old son of William A.
Rtstenpart, was attacked by a savage dog
yesterday afternoon, and but for the
friendly assistance of Mrs. M. C. Shipman,
would have received injuries which
might have proved fatal. As it is, the boy
was mauled about in a terrible way, and
fainted several times before he could bo
carried to a drug store.
Chester and his friend, George Sbipman,
were looking over some "cigar rings" in
front of the latter's house when a large
Newfoundland dog attacked him, mak
ing a snap at hia nose. Young Rlstenpart
ghouted at him to get away, But the sav

age animal sprang 1 to the attack, and, in
a mumÂ«nt, had the child in the gutter,
tearing at his tiesh.
Mrs. Shipman happened to see the
trouble from her house and ran immedi
ately to the boy's assistance. The beast
was" evidently frightened at her screams,
for he ran away as she came upon the
seen". Young Chester was taken into the
house, and later to a drug store. But hla
injuries were of such a nature that a
physician had to be summoned immedl
ately. Dr. Eastman was called. Ho
found it necessary to cut away several
pieces of flesh, so severely had the boy's
body been torn.
The dog was found later, and shut up
in Mrs. Shipman'H cellar. It is a very
large Newfoundland, and seems to belong
to no one in particular. The animal will
be killed as soon as the physician In
charge can determine whether it has hy
drophobia or not, in order to know what
treatment to prescribe for the patient.

STILL OWNS A MANSION

PAY FOR IT.
Suspicion That Mr. Gates Bore Some
Resemblance to Promoter
Hooley's English Aris
tocracy.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S. Broadway, Sept. '16.
One million eight hundred thousand
dollars!
This was the modest sum said to be
owned by Mr. "Swiftwatex" Gates when
he descended upon Oakland about a year
ago and threatened, its society with all
manner of dire upheavals. It now ap
pears that "Swiftwater's" imagination
was about five hundred times greater
than the reality. The information from
the Klondike and that contained in the
little complaint for a modest $299 99 nled
In San Francisco by Mr. Boyle has proved
at once a surprise and a relief to this
city. Mr. "Swiftwater" has been a thorn
in the side of Oakland society ever since
he purchasedâ lf he ever did purchase
that beautiful $25,000 mansion In the Lake
side district.
Now it is regarded as prettv nearly
true that Mr. "Swiftwater," the smaa
time he was here, treated to champagne
dinners on a sodawater income and
starved the rest of the year. In other
words, he aped the millionaire on four
lifths of an Income of a very moderately
fixed Dawson gold-digging laborer.
When Mr. "tiwlftwater" organized his
great company in Oakland it was consid
ered somewhat of an honor to be led into
the wealthy gentleman's presence. Some
of them were led into it upon the same
terms as Mr. Boyleâ by giving a paltry
$500 to be led over the trail and landed
safe and sound where they could earn $15
per day, and more if it were in sight. The
elegant mansion. It is said, Is still stand
ing in the name of Mr. Gates, and should
a Judgment be given against him it is
not altogether Impossible that the lovely
place may actually be attached. Mrs.
Swiftwater'" Gates, for whom the place
was bought, "merely as a toy," costing
but $20,000, has never, so far as known,
cast eyes on her Oakland plaything, and
there is more than a suspicion among
some intelligent Oaklanders that the pur
chase of the house was somewhat similar
in principle to the transactions which
Promoter Hooley of London carried on
with some of âe British aristocracy. Of
course, this insinuation is vigorously de
hied by Mr. Gates' friends, but the little
suit filed in San Francisco, coming so soon
after a report that Mr. Gates had gone
to the wall in Dawson, has forced people
to think, and those who did not bite at
the tempting circular issued about a year
ago are congratulating themselves.
Between f1.R00.000 and $8000,. of which
$5000 was borrowed for the occasion, there
is quite a difference.
CHEESEMAN'S MIND
TO BE EXAMINED
IF A LUNATIC HE CANNOT LE
GALLY PLEAD.
The Murderer of Brooke May Be Sent
to an Asylum Instead of the
â¢ Gallows.
O&kland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 23.
Frank W. Cheeseman may not be tried
for murder. If he should not appear to
be more rational next Tuesday morning
than he now Is, Judge Ellsworth will Im
panel a Jury to Inquire into the question
of the prisoner's sanity.
This morning Cheeseman was arraigned
in court but did not express any interest
in the proceedings and Judge Ellsworth
stated that the court was somewhat per
plexed as to the legal method of proced
ure. The murderer's attorney, T. F. Gar
rity, suggested that Cheeseman be ex
amined by a lunacy commission the samo
as any other suspected lunatic, but the
District Attorney objected to such a prop
osition. He maintained that the defend
ant Bhould be arraigned and the case set
for trial, and then if the jury should find
him mentally deranged, upon his recovery
he should then be tried.
Judge Ellsworth said he was not sure
whether an insane man could be legally
arraigned, and said that if the prisoner
was not shamming, to arraign him would
be folly, as it would Invalidate the pro
ceedings.
District Attorney Snook argued that
there was no provision of law by which
a man in the custody of the Sheriff could
be released, except after a trial. Judge
Ellsworth decided that on Tuesday morn
ing, if the murderer's symptoms do not
change, he will impanel a jury to pass
upon his mental condition.

whple for the purpose of discussing the
estimates for conducting the city govern
ment for the coming year and to fix the

City Clerk's office, $2000; making a total of
$5430.
Treasurer's office, $2929; Interest and redemp

City Attorneyâ Salary. $1200.
Street fundâ City Engineer, $330.
City poundâ sÃoo.
Exempt firemen's fundâ ssoo.
The total estimated expense is $116,
115 32, which on an assessed valuation of
$12,389,557 would give a rate of $1 15 on the
$100. Last year the rate was $1 10 on prac
tically the same assessed valuation, and
it is expected that the board will reduce
the estimates so as to make the rate no
higher than last year, and if possible a
little less.

GEORGE GREEN
KNOCKED OUT
F. McCONNELL
Ten Rounds of Very Heavy
Punching in Woodward's
Pavilion.
Greggains' Protege Fought a Game Battle,
but He Was Thoroughly Outgeneraled
by His Clever Opponent.
The National Athletic Club had a very
Bwell attendance at Woodward's Pavilion
last evening. The results of the enter
tainment were that George Green knock
ed out Frank McConnell in the tenth
round of a twenty-round contest; Fred
M&ynard won a decision over "K^d" Mc-
Fadden In ten rounds and Lou Agnew,
who was to fight Dudley Evans ten
rounds, was ordered out of the ring before
â¦the end of the first round.
Jimmy Murphy was selected as referee
of the McFadden-Alaynard contest and
because he rendered a very just decision
the gods In the gallery, who plways favor
a slogger when he Is pitted against a
clever man, hooted him unmercltully. In
fact, McFadden ran from his corner and
smashed Murphy a few times because of
his very poor judgment. The contest was
fairly interesting, except that Maynard
scored repeatedly on Mac's nose and eyes,
while the leads of the red-headed figa^r
Invariably fell short. True, McFadden
was the aggressor, but aggressiveness
without something more substantial back
of it will not count under Queensberry
ruling.
McJt'adden had probably the lead In the
eighth and ninth rounds, but in all other
rounds, Maynard outpointed his opponent
five to one
Then came the event of the evening.
It was a few minutes past 10 o'clock
when McConnell, trained to the hour, and
his seconds, Tim McGrath, Joe Reay and
Frank Schuler, entered the ring and se
lected the loser's corner.
Green, looking better than on many
past occasions, soon followed with his
esquires, namely "Bob" McArthur, Frank
Foster and Frank Purcell.
It was noticed that he had his hands
bandaged, but McArthur explained this
condition of affairs by stating that
oeorges knuckles were still rather sore
from the punching he gave "Billy" Smith
In New "iork. The fighters weighed in
yesterday afternoon at 152 pounds.
It was noticed just as soon as Referee
"Jack" Kitchen ordered the men to the
center of the ring purposely to have an
understanding concerning clinching,
breaking away, infighting, etc., that Mc-
Connell had two or three inches the bet
ter of Green in height, but what George
lost in stature he made amends for in a
good trunk, good limbs and neck.
Soon after the conference the master
of ceremonies with a fog-horn voice an
nounced that the contestants had agreed
to hit in a clinch or in the breakaway.
This news fell like a stroke of lightning
on the ears of McConnell' s friends, as
they knew only too well that the man
with the short and powerful arm and
muscular shoulders had a decided ad
vantage in tnis game over his opponent
of the racehorse build.
It was 10:2u o'clock when the gong
on the perch struck one, and Frank and
George sprang from their respective
stools and faced each other on the
scratch. Me was first to lead a left,
which landed very lightly on Green's
ribs. This was followed by a clinch and
a respectable breakaway. Mac then
ewung his left for the jaw, but George
ducked and missed a right swing which
was intended to land on Macs pointed
chin.
Green fiddled around his quarry, and
getting within range of Mac's face he
planted a good right on the neck. This
was followed by a clinch, and in the
break Mac sent in his right with telling
effect under George's left arm. Green
was trying many moves in the hope of
discovering any new blows which his
opponent may have had up his sleeve.
The second round opened up very nicely,
but before its finish the pugilists were
smashing at each other in rather wild
fashion. It was about the middle of the
round when, after the men broke from a
clinch, McConnell smashed Green a hard
right on the nose. George looked dazed
but grew suddenly wild and ferocious and
dashed at his opponent like a madman.
Exchanges of rapid blows followed and
everybody expected to see a quick knock
out on either side. During a hot rally
McConnell slipped and fell on his hands,
but when he regained his pins Green went
at him like a fighting dog, and just as the
gong sounded he smashed McConnell a
hard uppercut, which skinned the re
ceiver's nose, the biood flowing in a
Btream.
It was anybody's fight up to the eighth
round, when Green, by clever feinting,
lowered McConnell's guard and smashed
him a hard right on the ear. But Mac
came back quickly and hit Green a sharp
right on the jaw. Tnis was followed by
a rally, and both men came out of the
tnixup with honors even. McConnell. after
dodging around the ring a few seconds
tried a Tracey rush and swung, but the
blow skinned Green's Jaw and Mac fell
6prawling on the floor.
Green had the better of the ninth as he
bad gauged his man and was doing good
execution at close range.
The tenth was the warmest and most
Interesting of all. Gr<*en went In for
rapid fighting, and after two minutes of
heavy punching at close quarters Green
slipped and fell with McConnell on top.
Again they went at it like demons, and
Green forced McConnell back to the ropes
near the latter's corner.
After landing a wicked short arm right
In Mac's ribs George clinched with his left
arm around McConnell's neck. Frank,
for some reason, turned to the referee
â¢with the intention of calling his atten
tion to some supposed foul committed by
Green, George saw his opportunity and
vnnked Mac's head toward him with his
left glove, and quick a* a flash he
smashed him with his right on the chin
falling McConnell and winning the flght
by a knockout.
McConnell was outgeneraled all through
the game. Green, by clever fiddling, had
Mac on his toes all the time, and as a
consequence the protege of Afexander
Groggains fell short on many blows which
â¢would have had a telling effect had thev
lnndod. McConnell's arm work was good
but his foot work was miserable. He.
however, put up a gallant flght.
GREEN WAS CONFIDENT.
He Tells How He Gained the Victory.
Now Anxious to Meet
Smith.
George Green was carried to his dress-
Ing room by his jubilant friends. He
showed signs of having undergone a
heavy boxing bout. His nose was swollen
and his choeks were puffed, while red
â pots over his anatomy snowed where his
rival's gloves had landed. Withal he was
as fresh and confident as when he stepped
Into the ring. The victor made the fol
lowing statement:
"I was confident all along. I went Into
the ring not feeling the bost, and I did
not tell my friends to bet on me. I hurt
my arm In the second round and slowed
down. I led with a left hook and at the
same moment McConnell led with his
right. The result was that he ran right
Into me. striking me in the arm wnere I
once had a dislocation, and it pained me
considerably. I slowed down after that
and waited for a right knockout. I
'kidded' him along with my left until I
got him.
"We fought very game from the start
and need not be discouraged by his being
beaten by me. as he can fight some of
thpsp other fellows. He is a good man,
but is a little Inexperienced.
"McConnell never hurt me at any time
In the contest. I waited for my arm to
rest and then landed. The first time I
knocked him down with a lefthand Jolt.
It was not one punch that gained me a
victory, but the continued hammering. I
finished him with a 'right' in the belly
and another 'right' on the jaw.
"T now want to fight 'Billy' Smith out
here. Whfn ho beat me in the East I
was not in condition. T am now, and
hope to meet b'm npnin."
McCONNELL EXPLAINS.
young: McConnell quickly revived from
the blows that finished him. The only
mark of punishment was a big bruise*
on the bridge of his nose where Green's
glove had landed. There was a lack of
Jollity in the defeated man's room. Mc-
Connell's friends tried to raise his droop
ing spirits by praising him on the plucky
and splendid fight he put up. This in a
measure reconciled him to defeat, and
when asked to make a statement he said:
"I think I was a little ahead of my
time. I have only been in the business a
little over a year and in that time I have
met the best of them. I have taken on
the leaders, and felt confident that I
could do well against Green. That I did
not win is my misfortune.
"The only punch 1 felt during the whole
fight was the one in the stomach and the
rap on the jaw. m the second round he
had me going and 1 had him going. From
the very start I thought I had an even
break. In the second round I nearly '-ot
him, and up to the last mixup things were
THE FOUR-MASTED CUPPER BARK GALENA,
This is her first voyage to this port under the house flag of Thomas Sheet of Calao. Peculiar weather was
encountered during the run from Antwerp. For days the average run was from 20 to 30 knots, and then a
spanking breeze came along and the vessel made her 14, 15 and 16 knots an hour right along for a week. Her
best day's run was 310 knots, or an average of 13 knots an hour.
very even, as his punches were not both
ering me.
"Had I not been thrown to the floor I
would have stayed with him. I would
have got up before at the right moment
and continued the fight. The blow in the
stomach was a hard one. and the blow on
the jaw likewise, but the throw down
finished me. Whether I will flght again
or ask for a return engagement with
Green I cannot at present say. It re
mains with the club managers whether I
get another match."
AGNEW WAS INTOXICATED.
The Pugilist Enters the Ring in an
Inebriated Condition.
Lon Agnew, whose reputation for en
tering the ring in an inebriated condition
Is well known, carried out his usual pro
gramme last night. That he was not in
condition to fight at all was noticeable
as soon as he stepped in the center of
the ring and took his orders from Ref
eree Fox. Layers of fat covered his vul
nerable points, and his movements were
slow and awkward. At the sounding of
the gong he made a foolish pass at "Dud"
Evans and was staggered with a right
smash in the jaw. E'rom that moment
his actions puzzled the ring-goers. He
maneuvered about the ring like a ship
In a storm, and was followed by Evans,
who administered all kinds of punish
ment. It was at once evident that the
pugilist was at his old tricks, and the
crowd began to yell "take him away."
Once In a while he made an idiotic swing
at hiÃ opponent, nearly reeling to the
floor in the effort.
Captain Oillen, seeing his condition,
jumped into the ring and ordered the men
apart. Evans was given the decision.
The captain then notified Manager Groom
to have the next brace of sloggers ex
amined by. Dr. Bunnell before he per
mitted them to begin fighting. Captain
Gillen stated afterward that he would
never allow Agnew to fight while he was
on duty, as the pugilist was either crazy
or Intoxicated.
In his dressing room Agnew became en
raged at one of his seconds and made
a pass at him, which had it landed would
have placed him under the table.
One of Agnew's seconds was unkind
enough to remark that he thought the
fight was fixed, and it would seem so,
as the parts mutuels paid $10 80.
Evans donned his outer clothing and
left his dressing room with a complacent
smile. He said Agnew punched him hard,
but he showed no signs of punishment.
"Kid" Maynard's disgraceful attack on
Referee Murphy earned him very few
friends among the better element. It was
easily apparent that Maynard had scored
the most points up to the eighth round.
He turned himself loose during. the last
two rounds, but received just what he
sent.
McFadden In his dressing room between
sobs said he had put. up $50 on the fight.
I He also said Maynard would not dare to
! fight him again. On the other hand May
! nard replied: "I ain't got nuthin' to say
about it. See me manager. Spider Kelly."
Captain Gillen felt grieved that his offi
cers did not act properly during the fight,
and tried to smooth over their short
comings by Baying they had such a lot
to contend with. He pointed to clear
aisles and everybody being in their seats,
but forgot to explain why policemen were
bo rough In handling peaceful citizens. He
regretted the act of Officer Kenville
and also the roughness of Officer Cal
nan. Both were reproved for their con
duct, but this did not satisfy the feel
ings of those citizens who were witnesses
of the conduct of both men.
Suit for Damages.
Suit was filed yesterday afternoon by
William A. Field ana Kate Field for

The arrival of the four-masted bark
Galena brings a new ship-owner Into the
California trade. Thomas Shut is well
known as a merchant prince of Callao
and Liverpool, but it Is only within the
last year or so that he has blossomed out
as a ship-o'wner. lie first purchased the
Four Winds, then the Eudora, and then
added the Galena to his fleet just before
that vessel began loading at Antwerp for
San Francisco. He was lucky in secur
ing Captain Blair to bring his ship here,
as that gentleman is one of the ablest
masters in the California trade.
The Galena is a very smart vessel, and
beat the crack Vimeira easily on the run
from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Still
there were days when she did not log a
mile an hour and others when she ac
tutilly lost ground. Then about the mid
dle of July a spanking breeze picked her
up and sent her along at steamer time.
Her best run on that occasion was 310
knots in twenty-four hours. Sunday at
noon she was 145 miles off the Faral
lones, and at 11:30 p. m. she was at an
chor on the 55-fathom bank two miles
from the island.
Captain Blair of the Galena was for
merly here in the famous steel clipper
ship California. She was sold to the Ger
mans, and the captain took command of
the bark Santiago. That vessel was sold
here, and is now in the sugar trade.
Then Captain Blair took command of the
North Star, and when she was sold he
took command of the Galena.
The North Star is a new vessel, and
Captain Blair was in command on her
fourth voyage. This was the only occa
sion on which she reached her home port
without having been dismantled. James
Green, the steward of the Galena, has
followed the fortunes of Captain Blair
through every ship he has been In.

FOUND DEAD ON A LAWN
A REVOLVER LAY NEAR, BUT
PERHAPS WAS A "BLIND."
Strong Suspicion That the Man Was
Foully Murdered â Several
Clews for Identifi
cation.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, Sept. 23.
The body of an unknown man was
found on the greensward in front of Mrs.
Tabor's boarding-house, 533 Hobart street,
shortly before 11 o'clock to-night with
five bullet holes through the breast. The
affair is shrouded in mystery.
An elderly man called at the City Pris
on and notified the police that a drunken
man was lying on the grass, and when
Officers Hynes and Swain went to in?
scene they found the young man dead
with a 3S-caliber revolver lying six inches
from the body. The body was still warm.
The head was lying toward the house.
The Coroner was immediately notified,
and the remains were removed to thu
Morgue.
The lodgers at Tabor's heard five shots
fired about 10:40 to-night. Harry Tabor
states that there was a pause between
the first and second shots, and the other
three were In rapid succession.
"I heard the shots, but did not pay
any attention to them," said H. Tabor.
"This is a pretty time of night to wake
people up. What can we do if a fellow
commits suicide on the lawn?"
Harry Tabor is employed by Crane &
Co., wholesale plumbers in this city.
Harry Lewis, who also rooms at the
Tabor House, says that when he heard
the shots he looked out the window, but
it was so dark â the electric lights not be
ing lighted on account of the moonlight
schedule â that he could see nothing.
At the Morgue the bod" was thoroughly
examined. On the person of deceased
were found $5123; a key with a "No. 4"
tag attached; two Southern Pacific bag
gage checks, Nos. 37234 and 47838; a gold
watch of the American Waltham make,
numbered 51351471; a silk handkerchief
with the letter "C" worked in one cor
ner, and three linen kerchiefs; a speci
men of gold; several cigars and a rosary.
There were no papers found that might
lead to an identification.
The deceased was evidently a machin
ist, judging from his hands. He wore a
neat black m*** cutaway coat, black
slouch hat, striped black and white tie,
made up four-in-hand.
The coat , bears the mark of "Henry
Kilp, manufacturer for the trade, San
Francisco," and this mark is dated
7-12-98. He wore a black slouch hat and
cheap shoes. A pin was also found of
the Ancient Order of Druids. The suit
was also marked "order B 42" and this
the Coroner believes will lead to Identi
fication.
The body Is that of a fairly well put up
man, apparently about 30 years of age,
about 5 feet 11 Inches in height, high fore
head, brown eyes, light brown mustache
and heavy features, the teeth are perfect.
That the shots were fired at close range
is borne out by the fact that the shirt
Is badly powder burned.
The suicide theory was at first ad
vanced, but the fact of five bullets in
close proximity to the heart dispelled this,
and the opinion prevails that the man
was most foully murdered, and the 38
caliber Colts afterward thrown down by
his side as a blind.
The Tabor House is the abode of Miss
Tabor, who attained considerable noto
riety a few weeks ago when it was dis
covered that the man she married. Rev.
Ural Hughes, had a wife living in the
East and was therefore a bigamist. Rev.
Hughes had an unusual experience in a
San Jose pastorate, and has not been
heard from for several weeks, although
it was understood that he was in British
Columbia.
The people who live in the house next
to the Tabors were conversing in the par
lor when they heard the shots. Five were
counted distinctly, and then the occu
pants ran out to ascertain the cause. No
one was in sight, and the neighbors
thought the shots must have been fired
for run or that the 1 "- had been deceived/
The shooting, they Bay, occurred at 10:35,
but it was nearly an hour later when
some one passing by saw the figure of a
man lying on the grass.
Not a sound was heard- by anybody in
the neighborhood except the reports of
the pistol. There was no Bcreaming
heard, and the neighbors ran out so
quickly after the shooting that had the
victim uttered a, groan or a cry they must
have heard him.
The police are of the opinion that tho
murder theory alone is tenable, as thc
five Bhots are all within five inches of
each other, and all are either over or
alongside the heart, making It almost Im
possible that they could ha.vs heen self
inflicted.
GENEROUS GIFT
TO METHODISM
Mrs. Sarah Woodward's
Donation.
GIVES VALUABLE PROPERTY
SIGNS DEEDS OF TRANSFER TO
BISHOP HURST.
Seattle Lots and Buildings Valued at
Over $150,000 to Be Acquired
by the American University
at Washington.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PACIFIC GROVE, Sept. 23.â One of
the largest benevolences of recent years
has Just been brought to a consum
mation at this place, and, involving as
it does the transfer of over $150,000
worth of property from a private in
dividual to the Methodist educational
work in America, it is a matter of the
greatest moment to the Methodist
Episcopal church. Mrs. Sarah Wood
ward of Saratoga, Santa Clara County,
has signed the necessary papers giv
ing to Bishop John F. Hurst, D. D.,
chancellor of the American University
at Washington, D. C, an option of six
months to receive a deed of gift for
the institution, of which he is the head,
to property in the city of Seattle,
Wash., valued at over $150,000. The
property includes two pieces of im
proved real estate, one on the corner
of Main and Commercial streets, on
which stands a stone office building
valued at $95,000, and the other resi
dence property on Sixth street, between
Union and Pike streets, valued at $60,
000.
The papers of this transaction were
executed during the last days of the
California Conference that has just
closed at this place, over which Bishop
Hurst presided. J. H. Wythe Jr. of
Auburn was one of the persons most
deeply concerned in the transaction, it
being through his instrumentality that
Mrs. Woodward was led to make her
munificent donation to the American
University.
The matter has been in the wind for
about a year, Mrs. Woodward's first
intention being to deed the property to
Dr/ Eli McClish in trust for the Uni
versity of the Pacific at College Park,
California. When the proposition was
laid before the trustees of that insti
tution they decided that notwithstand
ing how greatly the university needed
the big rentals accruing from the prop
erty, they were altogether unprepared
to undertake the responsibility of the
management of such a property, and
therefore felt that they could not ac
cept it. It was then that Mrs. Wood
ward decided to transfer it to Bishop
Hurst for the American University, and
as Bishop Hurst also did not wish to
receive so valuable a gift at such short
consideration, she gave him a six
months' option to receive it.

FAIR WOMEN GRACE THE HORSE SHOW.
Burlingame Enlivened by the
Annual Outdoor Exhibition
of Equipages.
TRIBUNE FROM WHICH SPECTATORS VIEW THE JUDGING.
THE grounds of the Burlingame Coun
try Club were the scene yesterday of
the San Mateo County Open-air
Horse Show Association's annual ex
hibition. For the first time the show
â¢will extend over two days, the exercises
of yesterday being in the nature <>Â£ a
curtain-raiser, or preliminary canter, as
the horsemen have it.
The affair, which assumed the guise of
an open air fete, was an exact reproduc
tion of the shows which were such mark
ed features of the season in this city for
some years. The same beautiful
women, brilliant gowns, splendid equip
ages and dapper grooms were all there,
and suffered nothing through being
Bhown under cloudless skies. Even
"Dickey" Graham, the cleverest of all
ringmasters, was there with his shining
tile, severely black coat, English cord
riding breeches and top boots. There
was no drag to the long programme, as
no sooner was one class Judged than he
had the representatives of another with
in sound of his sweet-toned coaching
horn.
The members of the Burllngame Club,
under whose patronage the show was
given, commenced to gather at the club
house shortly after high noon. Lunch
eon was served on the veranda, where
members and th<Mr guests had assembled
in numbers. Shortly after 1 o'clock the
bugle calls of the Fourth Cavalry Band
were heard. This was the signal that
the judging was about to commence, and
the spectators began to maks their way
toward the appointed rendezvous.
This was a level space to the east of
the club house, where a ring of liberal
dimensions had been marked out. For
the accommodation of the onlookers a
huge marquee tent had been erected to
shield them from the rays of the sun.
Near by was a smaller tent for the band
men, while refreshment booths were
placed within easy access. _..,,,*
The mounted band of the Fourth Lnit
ed States Cavalry proved one of the fea
tures of the afternoon's exercises. The
men. who were mounted on their well
known gray horses, rode around the ring
several times, playing a lively march.
After this their horses were sent to the
paddock and the musicians played
CRACKED THE
SKULL OF A
LITTLE BOY
Outrageous Conduct
of a Policeman.
WILLIE LYNCH HIS VICTIM
HE IS DYING IN THE RECEIVING
HOSPITAL.
Officer Xenville Distinguishes Him
self at the Fight by Fatally-
Injuring a Ten- Year-
Old Lad.
The policemen attached to the Seven
teenth-street station distinguished them
selves in a manner at the prize fight last
night that should not be overlooked by
the Police Commissioners. Not satisfied
with abusing and maltreating respectable
citizens, one of their number struck a 10
year-old boy over the head with his club
Inflicting injuries from which the unfor
tunate victim will, in all probability, die.
The lad's name is Willie Lynch and he
lives at 166 Clara street. Accompanied by
several other boys young Lynch stood in
front of Woodwards Pavilion, anxious to
hWr the result of the first fight.
be patrolman Frank Kjmvffle. evidently
anxious to make a record, charged on thÂ«
boys his ever ready club swinging in the
air and his curses being loud enough to
attract attention even in a Barbary Coast
dive The boys, catching a glimpse of
the infuriated 'policeman started to run,
when the latter threw his club at them,
striking young Lynch on top of the head,
fracturing his%kull in two places
John I. Sparrow, an employe ofC. E.
Whitney & Company, seeing the boy fall,
and realizing that he was seriously In
jured accosted Kenvllle and asked him
what 'he meant by his conduct.
"Say. what yer glvin' me? remarked
the jjoilcemanu assuming an aogrjr atu
throughout the Judging. The men rode
down during the morning and camped
near the club house. They will remain
until Sunday. In addition to the spec
tators who occupied seats in the canvas
pavilion were many who preferred to rr
main in their private equipages. These
were grouped about one corner of the
ring. The people of the countryside were
also well represented. They came in car
riages, on bicycies or on foot, and proved
as interested in the proceedings as did
those who were represented in the ring.
The first class shown was that of trot
ting stallions. David Creswell, the pains
taking superintendent of the Burllngame
Club, carried off in triumph the blue rib
bon representing first prize, with his
horse Buttons Jr., the red ribbon being
â won by John Kenner, with Llghtfoot.
John Parrotfs Peplta and Paquita were
awarded the blue ribbon of honor in the
second class for pairs of light harm ss
horses. Stven teams were shown to hai
ness in the ring and were pronounced by
the judges to bo of exceptional class. C.
de Gulgne took second place with Punch
and Poker, while Henry J. Crocker's
Visalla and Fresno defeated the other en
tries for the white ribbon.
Magnet, Prince Ponlatowskl's repre
sentative in the thoroughbred stailion
class had matters all his own way, the
remaining entries falling to appear. The
absentees included \V. S. Hobart'a crack
Bright Phoebus.
In single roadsters J. C. Kirkpatrick"s
Azalia won handily. He was shown by
his owner. John Kenner's Lightfoot was
placed second and David Creswell's Real
third.
In the single horses there was a strong
showing, the honors resting with John
Parrott s Pepita and second prize with
the same owner's Paquita. Earlier in the
afternoon these horses won a blue ribbon
when shown as a double team. Prince
Poniatowski's Silver King was awarded
third place. Many of the horses wore
driven by their owners, who showed all
the cleverness of professional whips.
The hackney classes were accorded to
John Parrotfs Green's Rufus from the
start. The high stepping hackney was
shown in splendid condition and his ap
pearance was nicely set off by his white
ring harness. A number of his progeny,
all showing his marked individuality
were also shown.
Mr. Klrkpatrick and Mr. Creswell again
met in the roadster class for pairs, the
former driving: his black team and the
latter the pair he had shown separately
in previous classes.
tude. "I didn't cop the kid."
"I saw you strike him with your club,**
replied Sparrow, "and you ought to be
ashamed of yourself."
"Oh, get next. Yer know the kid was
knocked down by one of the gang."
As Kenvllle covered up his star and at
tempted to sneak off in the crowd Spar
rov>- seized him by the arm and snatched
the star from nis coat. In the struggle
that followed Kenvllle regained posses
sion of the star, but not until Sparrow
had noted the number of it. The Indig
nant citizen then picked un the wounded !
boy and calling a nack had him removed
to the Receiving Hospital.
Drs. Hartley and Zobel, who examined
him, found that his skull was fractured
in two places.
The unfortunate boy was still con
scious, and while the doctors trepinedhis
skull he repeatedly called for his mother.
"Please send for her, won't you?" he
begged. "I did not tell her I was going
to the prize fight."
Both the surgeons gave it as their opin
ion that the boy could not possibly sur
vive his injuries.
"This is an outrage." Indignantly re
marked Sparrow, as he assisted. in plac
ing the wounded boy on the operating ta
ble in the hospital. "If policemen are al
lowed to strike down inoffensive boys it
It time for the residents of this city to
call a halt."
In telling the Btory of the brutal assault
Sparrow said:
"I was standing near the entrance to
the pavilion when I noticed a crowd of
boys, among whom was young Lynch.
Sergeant Pc-rrin appeared at this junc
ture and approaching Kenvllle he told
him that one of the boys hftd thrown a
stone at him.
"Drawing his club Kenville charged on
the boys, and as they ran he emitted a
string of oaths and threw his stick at
them.
"1 oung Lynch Immediately fell, and,
realizing he was seriously injured, I
rushed up to Kenvllle and told him that
he had killed the boy. He replied that I
was n. liar, and declared that- somebody
had knocked the boy down. As he tried
to cover up the star, evidently to prevent
me from getting his number, I grabbed
him by the arm and tore the star off his
coat. I lost It In the scuffle, but managed
to see the number of It. After picking up
his star he disappeared in the crowd
without attempting to do anything for
the Innocent boy whom he had injured.
"As blood was pouring from the lad's
head and realizing he was seriously In
jured, I called a hack, and accompanied
him to the hospital."
Shortly after the boy had reached the
hospital several Citizens who witnessed
the accident appeared and volunteered to
make complaint against the officer. Their
names are: "W. Brown. 21 Adeline ave
nue; D. Taylor, 676 Liberty street; and
George Green. 2220 Pine street.
Edward Kenny, aged 10 years, living at
486 Tehama street, was with Lynch when
he was struck down by the over-vigilant
policeman. With tears streaming down
his cheeks he said:
"I was sitting on a Valencia-street car
when I noticed Willie Lynch standing
with some other boys near the entrance
to the pavilion. I called him over, and
as be came tiio other boys followed bim.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1898.
To the spectators the most interesting
classes were those of the four-in-hands
and the saddle horses and Jumping pon
ies. The contest among the four-in-hands
dwindled to a contest between H. J.
Crocker and C. A. Baldwin. The former
occupied the box of his own coach, While
Mr. Baldwin tooled the club coach. The
blinds of Mr. Crocker's coach were down,
while those of the one driven by Mr.
Baldwin were closed. This, in keeping
with the etiquette of the ancient pastime
of coaching. Mr. Crocker carried off,
amid much applause, the coveted bit of
blue ribbon, although one of his horses
was slightly lame.
The spectacular part of the day's pro
gTamme was supplied by the ponies. They
were first shown under saddle, the own
ers being up in the majority of cases.
Later they appealed for the Jumping,
and for a time a serious outcome seemed
a possibility.
Prince Poniatowski's gray pony Racket,
ridden in fetching style by Charles Dun
phy. a mere lad. won the blue ribbon.
Both horse and rider were in accord. The
boy had a seat like a veteran horseman,
and was loudly applauded as he cantered
the winner in front of tho spectators.
Harry Slmpkins on R. M. Tobin'3 Ro
slna won second prize, and John Lawson
took third on his own Greygown. By a
coincidence the prize winners were all
grav ponies.
Walter Hobart scored his triumph of
the day on Lady Greensleeves in the
Jumping class. Increasing weight has
not taken from him his graceful seat nor
his light hand. He cleared the Jumps
cleverly, which could not be said of his
opponents. The ponies breasted the
Jumps, but refused to rise to them.
Charles Dunphy on John Lawson's Grey
gown won second place, and W. P. A.
Brewer on his j>ony Dandy third. Just
before taking o* of the jumps the glrt,h
of Mr. Brewer s saddle broke, and he
narrowly escaped a serious fall.
The p'roErramme will be resumed this
morning and continued throughout the
day. A large attendance if expected.
Members of the Los Angeles Club will at
tend to gather knowledge that will be
useful to them In handling their forth
coming show. They are anxious to join
hands with the local horse-owners, for a
joint show in this city next year. Among
the spectators yesterday were:
Mr :tn.l Mr?. Mountfonl Wilson, Mr. and
Mrs \Vllllnm S. Tovls, Mr. and Mrs. Chase,
Mr. and Mrs. Joseph T>. Grant. Piinre and
Princess Ponlatowskl, Major J. It. Rathbone,
Mr and Mrs. Charles A. Baldwin, Mrs. C. A.
Just then somebody threw a stone at
Sergeant Perrin, and, as he and Keiivillt:
came after us, we ran up the street. We
had gone only a few feet when Lynch
fell. I heard him groan, and looking
around I saw the policeman's club on the
sidewalk. I picked it up and was about
gf-tting away with it when Kenville
grabbed me and took it away from me,"
When seen at the Seventeenth-street
station two hours after the occurrence,
Kenville sat In the office of Sergeant Per
rin, surrounded by a crowd of sympatniz
ing fellow-officers, who were endeavoring
to cheer him with vociferous assurances
of their belief in his innocence. But the
loud-mouthed faith of his friends went for
naught. The guilty officer's hands shook
with fear of deserved consequences, and
he could hardly control his tongue to co
herent statement. His uniform, his hands
and the very star that protects him were
still smeared with the red blood of hia
little victim, and he perceptibly shud
dered when his attention was called to it.
Asked for his statement of the affair,
and particularly if he hail struck young
Lyncn, Kenville replied:
"No, sir, I did not, and I'll leave It to
the sergeant. I did not have my club out
during the whole evening, did 1 sergeant?
There was a big crowd of men in front
of the building, and they had been dis
orderly all through the fight, and finally
Sergeant Perrin decided to clear the
street. He told me to get in and help
him and I did so. None of us drew our
clubs; we pimply ordered the crowd to
move on and we pushed them along as we
always do, but we didn't use our clubs.
"When we had got the crowd started
I turned round and saw the kid lying in
the street. I thought he had fainted and
1 went and picked him up and saw in a
minute that he was hurt. Then a fellow
rushed up to me and told me I had killed
the boy with my club and he took him
away from me.
"It is my idea that the boy was either
knocked down and kicked in the head, or
was hit by one of the stones that a lot
of boys over in the stock yards were
throwing at us. There is a big gang of
these kids that hang out in the stock
yard across from the pavilion, and they
not only pelt us but break all the win
dows in the neighborhood. Why, I was
hit myself to-night; a rook that somebody
throw hit me on the star."
A glance at Kenvllle's star revealed no
dent nor dirt, nothing but the blood of
young Lynch.
And then in the face of the evidence of
those who saw his act Kenville reiter
ated that all of the night he had not
drawn his club, and he left it to the near
by sergeant and the captain if it were not
so. And the sergeant and the captain as
surlngly nodded assent, and the little
group and sympathizing and admiring fel
low officers took their cue and smilingly
nodded assent also.
Kenville was not the only policeman
who "distinguished" mmself at the fight.
In mnr.y instances respectable citizens
were driven away to make room for some
pickpocket or opium fiend. Officer Cal
nan took it upon himself to seat all his
friends, evidently unmindful of the fact
that they did not have tickets. It is not
unlikely that Calnan's unseemly conduct
will be Investigated by the Commissioners
at the next meeting ot the board.

TJNDEB THE AMERICAN FLAG.
Endeavoring to Make Hawaiian Com-
merce a Coastwise Trade.
Hugh Craig of the Chamber of Com
merce recently telegraphed East a dis
patch setting forth tfte position of the
Chamber In the matter of having Hawaii
brought under the navigation laws of the
United States so that American vessels
only should handle the trade between the
islands and this country. The desire is
that the laws shall apply to vessels plyin/j
between here and the islands as they ap
ply between coastwise ports on this" con
tinent. Yesterday he received a dispatch
from one of the largest shipping firms of
New York, which reads:
'Have mailed to-day petition of East
ern shipowners urging your memorial to
Hawaiian Commission for application of
our navigation laws to Hawaii.
" ARTHUR SEWALL & CO."
This means that every effort will be
made to have the 'coastwise laws apply to
the island trade.

RETURNS TO
FIGHT IN
THE COURTS
Mrs. Craven Ready
for New Issues.
THE SAME COUNSEL ENGAGED
HER ATTORNEYS WILL MEET IN
A FEW DAYS.
Delmas Will Again Lead the Host
of Lawyers Who Will Op
pose the Fair
Heirs.
Mrs. Nettie R. Craven arrived yester
day morning from St. Louis and will
make her residence at the Palace for the
next few weeks. She has been away from
this city since February and has returned
to fight the battle anew with the Fair
heirs.
Mrs. Craven is not very communicative
concerning the details of her intended op
position to the heirs of Senator Fair.
Her mind reverts to her 3-month3 old
granddaughter whom she left In St.
Louis, who is pronounced by the fond
grandmother the most beautiful baby on
the continent. . . "
"My tight will now begin," said Mrs.
Craven. "The former case was brought
on the part of the Fairs and was an ac
tion to quiet title to the property which I
claimed was deeded to me. That matter
now rests on appeal and nothing will be
done in regard to that suit until we hear
from the Supreme Court."
Mrs. Craven admits that the Craven-
Fair controversy will break open again
and in the""*immediate future.
"I will bring a contest," she said, "for
other properties which I think are mine
of right and by law."
When interrogated about the contention
that she was the lawful wife of Senator
Fair, Mrs. Craven admitted that this
would necessarily enter into the suits
which are to be filed soon, but she de
clared that it was not the most material
â point. -
Continuing, she said: "I have the same
list of attorneys who appeared in the
trial of the action to quiet title in which
I was the defendant. Mr. Delmas is still
my leading counsel and George Curtis of
New Yorkâ the 'smasher*â will be associ
ated with him. W. W. Foote, George R.
Williams, Judge Denson, Abe Ruef and
General Dickinson are also of counsel. I
will ask my attorneys to accept the as
sistance of Koehler & Reis, attorneys of
St. Louis. Mr. Koehler is a brother of
my son-in-law, Henry Koehler, Jr. Should
my attorneys of this city make any ob
jections to this addition of legal artillery
I will not press the matter. I ask it only
as a matter of courtesy.
"The legal steps which I propose to
take will be upon new issues entirely. I
do not wish to speak of them in detail
out of courtesy to my attorneys. In a
few days there will be a meeting of all
the attorneys in the case and after that
consultation we will know what action to
take and when to begin."
Mrs. Craven will remain in this city for
some time. Hor daughter and son-in-law
will revisit San Francisco during the win
ter and will build a home here.

Ex-Treasurer A. C. Widber Resorts to Every Legal
Artifice to Escape Conviction.
INTENTLY watching every move
in the struggle to save him from a
felon's cell, A. C. Wldber sat all day
yesterday in Judge Carroll Cook's
court, taking copious notes of the
story of his shame. Close behind him
sat his mother and aunt, almost the
only persons left whom the ex-Treas
urer can call friends, for when expos
ure came the gay companions who
called him "Gus" and helped him
spend the city's thousands turned to
others nor gave a thought to the dis
honored official.
A change has come over "Widber
during the months he has spent in
jail. Then he was without hope, and
freely confessing his guilt, assumed
entire responsibility for the big defal
cation and declared his intention of
pleading guilty and accepting without
a murmur his just punishment. Now
his every energy is" bent toward sav
ing himself from this punishment. To
be sure he does not attempt to conceal
the fact of his guilt, but with the aid
of his attorney he is groping about
seeking some loophole In the loosely
woven law through which he may es

Widber is making a purely technical

AN EXPRESS TRAIN
HELD UP IN KANSAS
Pacific Express Company's Safe
Blown Open and the Treasure
Taken.
KANSAS CITY, Mo.. Sept. 23.â The Col
orado and Coffeyvllle express train on the
Missouri Pacific Railway, which left Kan
sas City at 9:15 o'clock to-night, was held
up by robbers near Leeds, a suburban
station about six miles out from the
Union depot. The locomotive and bag
gage car were detached from the Â«train
and taken down the track toward Dodson,
after which the robbers shattered the Pa
cific Express Company's car with dyna
mite.
The explosion of the dynamite used by
the robbers was heard by many persons
In the southeastern part of Kansas City.
Flying debris from the shattered car car
ried down telegraph wires along the
Frisco track, which parallels the Missouri
Pacific at that point. Before committing
the holdup the robbers entered the Frisco
station at Belt line, just east of Leeds,
and overpowered the operator. After
smashing the Instruments in his office,
fightâ a fight he must loseâ but by
which he hopes to gain time. That is
an. He will be convicted and sen
tenced. Then he will appeal to the
Supreme Court, pending which he will
be released on bail; can walk the
streets and renew old associations if
he will. The case will drag along, sent
back for retrial, maybe, in the years
to come, when the details are dimmed,
his own confession of guilt'forgotten
and the witnesses for the State dead
or scattered. That is undoubtedly
A\ ldber's hope and what he is work
ing for.
And such a travestv on the law!
Even during the first da'y of the actual
trial of the case the proceedings were
almost farcical. M. de la Montanya,
Widber's former chief deputy, was on
the stand all day, and toldâ what?

they took the operator with them to the
scene of the robbery.
Superintendent Moore, the Pacific Ex
press Company's chief official here, in
sists that the train carried very little
treasure.
The robbers numbered seven. It Is re
ported. The scene of the hold up is not
far from Brush Creek, or the Blue River,
where there is thick brush and heavy
timber, and the escape of the robbers
from that locality would not be a difficult
matter. A special train has taken police
and railway detectives to the scene. At
a late hour the train was still detained
there, owing:- to the wreck of the baggage
car. So far as can be learned the pas
sengers were not molested.

Annie Murphy, alias Annie Benson, was

or tne plunder or the my s treasure
sacks. District Attorney Hosmer con
ducted the examination, assisted by
H. C. Wilson, -who appeared in behalf
of the Fidelity and Deposit Coirfpany
of Maryland. Witness was not al
lowed to' volunteer a single statement.
Everything had to be drawn from him
and then only after a long, tedious
wrangle with defendant s attorney.
Mr. Piexotto objected to everything.
Judge and jury grew weary Hosmer
became exasperated more than once,
and the spectators were lul'td to
peaceful slumber by the dreary pro-
During the afternoon session just
an hour was consumed in debating the
admissibllity of the question as to the
ownership of the stolen money. Peix
otto read from legal authorities by the
yard, Hosmer responded in kind, the
Judge took a hand and finally witness
was permitted to swear that It was
the city's money. That was only one
instance. Every question asked Mon
tanya was objected to; Piexotto seem
ed to have an abiding fear that the
proper foundation for his testimony
would not be laid, and seemed to mind
not in the least when his objections
were overruled. When one was sus
tained he brightened perceptibly and
returned to the assault with renewed
vigor.
The net result of the day was that
De la Montanya told h6w he had first
discovered that one of the sacks in the
vault supposed to contain $8000 in gold
only had $250 in silver. He called Wid
ber's attention to it. and "after several
days' delay the Treasurer gave him a
check for the $5000. Other sacks were
afterward discovered to have been
tampered with in a similar manner,
and eventually "Wiuber confessed to
him that he was a defaulter to the ex
tent of about $76,000.
At the present rate of progress the
trial will last a week or ten days and
cost the city a tidy sum. And all be
cause the defaulter has concluded not
to stand by his first confession, but to
attempt to escape by a technicality.
Let all bow to the majesty of the
law.
