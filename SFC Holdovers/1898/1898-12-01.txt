SHERMAN IS SUED FOR A
QUARTER OF A MILLION
Pacific Bank at Last Demands
Restitution.
A MOST SENSATIONAL SUIT FILED
The Great Conspirator Accused of Violating
a Sacred Trust as the Agent of the
Institution.
When The Call-began its expose of the gigantic conspiracy that ruined the Pacific Bank and destroyed the People s
Home Savings Bank, this paper promised to prove that a gang of unscrupulous gamblers and ; unprincipled thieves who had for ;
nearly six years escaped public condemnation . and , punishment ; were the real destroyers of the institutions. The Call also
promised to prove that something more substantial than this would be done and that the public would be shown where and
how property belonging to the bank might .be discovered and restored to its rightful owners.. Both of these promises have
been kept. J; : : .. r; ;.â¢ â ",'.-.'.'.;'â â ' : , ' â  . \ / y'. **..''' .->*-,â¢ '. â 
The Call has shown that Moses H. : Sherman was the head and front and the master spirit of the entire conspiracy. This
man has proved himself to be in his own ; handwriting one of the most unscrupulous and dishonest men who ever operated in â 
this State. He has proved himself to be a cqrrupte.r of public officials, a briber of private individuals and a manipulator of the
most dangerous character. ' He has won" out of the Pacific Bank and the People's Home Savings Bank a tremendous fortune,
and now the Pacific Bank demands at least a part of this fortune in restitution. â  . \ , '
The Call has shown the appalling manipulations .of the thieving McDonalds, father and sons. The record shows how
; these '- sons .plunged 1 into every wild scheme and deliberately robbed the men and women who had been deluded into confi
dence by the hypocrisy of the McDonalds. * ? The association of every scheming sycophant who fed upon the McDonalds has
been sufficiently exploited to justify The Call's promise of exposure. While r many of the most important; letters written by
these men have' not been published, enough has been said to warrant the condemnation these parasites have received.
: " In the ? interests of justice and for the sake of the depositors and creditors of the two ruined banks, The Call will not
continue the publication at this time. There is in justification of this course the fact that two very important suits have been
in.<=/ ; tj'ted and others are 'hr^iter -^. T" Vetoing its pr-W"^ to j-h-vv to *he creditor? and the deposif.-s *f rthf t&O '-antes
wtire property belonging to the institutions might be recovered, reference is made particularly to the Market street prop
erty and the Norfolk land of Dr. R. :H. McDonald and the possessions of Moses H. Sherman. The Call has published, as far as
justice to the creditors would permit, every detail that was necessary to -assist the creditors in ; regaining their property. ;
The Market street land has already been attached by creditors of the bank. The Norfolk real estate has been proved to be un
questionably the possession of Dr. McDonald, but conveniently held in the name of bogus corporations. A sensational: suit ,
against Moses H. Sherman : has been begun and with the publication of that fact The Call concludes for the present its expose
of the ruin of two of the greatest banks that ever existed on the Pacific Coast
Moses H. Sherman was sued by the
Pacific Bank in the Superior Court of
this city yesterday for a quarter of a
million dollars. The authorities of the
Pacific Bank have at last begun legal
action to make the great Los Angeles
manipulator disgorge some of his Ill
gotten gains and to force him to a res
titution of a part of the enormous sum
of money he obtained from the defunct
bank through his unexampled financial
knavery.
The sensational action which was
commenced yesterday in this city will
be prosecuted rapidly to a conclusion.
The arch-conspirator who has been
made defendant will be forced to give
an accounting of his conduct of the
Lob Angeles Electric Railroad. The
creditors and depositors of the Pacific
Bank, if the suit against Sherman be
successful, will recover dollar for dol
lar what had been stolen from them.
The institution of the suit against
Sherman is the direct result of the
startling expose which has been made
by The Call.
In denouncing the scoundrels who
ruined the bank and In exploiting the
true history of the conspiracy that
brought destruction to the Institution,
The Call has supplied the evidence
upon which the creditors base their
legal action for restitution. Through
the efforts of The Call the valuable
property situated upon Market street
In this city was shown to be a posses
sion of Dr. R. H. McDonald, against
whom the statute of limitations has not
run, and who may still be sued. This
property has been seized by the credi
tors /it the McDonald bank. The enor
mous landed estates of Dr. McDonald
at Norfolk, Va., may also be attached,
as The Call has proved that they be
long to Dr. McDonald. It has been
shown that other valuable property is
subject to legal execution, and now Mo
ses H. Sherman must show why he
shall not give up one quarter of a mil
lion dollars that he received from the
bank and which the authorities of the
defunct institution now claim right
fully belongs to the creditors. The evi
dence upon which this claim Is based
has been kept for nearly six years a
profound secret.
There was a contract entered into be
tween Frank McDonald and Sherman
by which the latter became a trustee
for the McDonalds in the great Los
Angeles Electric Railroad. The history
of this contract and of the measures
dishonorably adopted by Sherman to
evade the fulfillment of his obligation
are of the greatest importance to the
creditors. It has been claimed that the
statute of limitations operated, but
this is not the fact, as the suit has
been brought by attorneys who thor
oughly understand their business and
are not engaged in the occupation of
bringing useless suits. The action that
ft-as instituted yesterday was brought
by Denson. Oatman & Denson, acting
for the Pacific Bank. The complaint
was gworn to and verified by H. G.
Meyer, the president of the bank. Sher- |
The San Francisco Call
man must now defend his ill-gotten !
gains and explain a remarkable series J
of incidents that marked his operations j
in the Los Angeles Electric Railroad.
In the complaint of the Pacific Bank j
the history of the secret agreement be
tween the cashier of the institution and
Sherman is set forth at length. It will
be remembered that the Los Angeles j
Electric Railroad was incorporated in |
1887 under the laws of the Territory of .
Arizona for $5,000,000. The incorpora- j
tion was made under these laws for the
deliberate purpose of avoiding stock
holders' liability. Sherman and the Me- \
Donalds intended to make great profit j
out of the cable road in the southern j
city, and Sherman's purpose was not j
only to ruin and then possess the cable
road, but to bleed the Pacific Bank and
every other corporation and individual
that could be Induced to enter into his j
scheme.
After the incorporaton of the railroad, j
B. O. Carr, the brother-in-law of Sher- j
man, was manager of the People's
Home Savings Bank, and in a variety
of ways assisted Sherman to secure J
franchises from the Los Angeles Coun- j
cil and prevent the McDonalds from I
becoming uneasy. In 1889 Frank Me- ;
Donald, acting not in his Individual j
capacity, but as cashier of the Pacific
Bank, entered into an agreement with
Sherman to pool 25,500 shares of the j
capital stock of the railroad. This pool |
was made in order that Sherman and i
the McDonalds might retain a control- !
ing interest in the railroad. The Pacific !
Rolling Mills had been induced to enter
the scheme and Sherman was fearful
that in the progress of the affair the
control might be wiested from him.
He therefore made his agreement
with the McDonalds, scheming at that
time not only to deceive the Pacific
Rolling Mills and the capitalists inter
ested in this Institution, but ultimately j
to force out the McDonalds and seize
entirely for himself the control of the
road. With these thoughts in his mind I
Sherman made his agreement with the j
Pacific Bank, and it is upon this agree
ment that H. G. Meyer, the president
of the defunct institution, now declares
that Sherman has cheated the Pacific
Bank out of a quarter of a million dol
lars. When Frank McDonald and Sher
man made their agreement in 1889
they specifically provided that 51 per
cent of the capital stock of the Los
Angeles Railroad, or 25,500 shares,
should be voted by the representatives
of the Pacific Bank and Moses H. Sher
man, under Joinx instruction from both.
In case the tv/o parties to the contract
could not agree then the stock was to
be voted by the person into whose
hands it was placed in such a manner
las to retain to Sherman and the Pa
i ciflc Bank a control of the road.
The pool was made for ten years and
I the agreement and the 25,500 shares of
! stock were placed in the hands of B.
I O. Carr, the manager of the People's
Home Savings Br.nk, ana the brother
tne conditions named in the agreement
SAIS FBANCISCO, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 1, 1898.
Carr was to act. There can be no ques
tion that the agreement was perfectly
legal Â»*** bound both parties. One
half of the stock belonged to the Pacific
Bank and, by the consent of that insti
tution, foolishly given, the other half
belongs to Sherman.
Yet this great manipulator cheated
the bankers out of their half and kept
the whole for himself. The history of
that financial knavery constitutes the
evidence that will be submitted to the
Sunerior Court of this city to compel
Sherman to give up a quarter of a mil
j lion dollars that the authorities of the
j bank Insist does not belong to him, but
to the creditors of the Pacific Bank.
Under the circumstances indicated
the Los Angeles Electric Railroad cor
poration was organized. The Pacific
Bank and Sherman having retained
| fifty-one per cent of the stock, there
remained for other uses forty-nine per
j cent, which was distributed in a va-
I rlety of ways and for a variety of rea
sons. There was influence to be bought
and stock was given to purchase this
! influence. When the conspirators went
j to the Pacific Rolling Mills to demand
i large concessions the names of such men
! as A. N. Towne, R. H. Pratt, Samuel
i Miller, J. T. Bass and J. M. C. Marble
were shown as stockholders in the
electric railroad. These men possessed
; power and standing, but they paid
I nothing for their stock.
Later In ttte development of the
scheme It was shown that certain offi-
I cers of the Pacific Rolling Mills, such as
L. B. Benchley, also possessed stock.
These men were Influential and Sher
man needed them in furthering his
scheme. After the organization of the
corporation and the issue of the bonds
Sherman possessed an absolute control.
Even then Frank McDonald vigorously
objected to the high-handed proceed
! ings of his associate, but his objections
were in vain. At one time two boards
of directors .were in existence and ope
! rating, but Sherman always won the,
j victory.
He had the absolute disposition of
the funds of the railroad. He bought
the site that the power house now
stands on and paid for the purchase in
bonds to Easton & Eldridge. In all the
' affairs, where moneys was involved,
i Sherman was forced to account to no
one. He bought land and extra cars
and franchises and the reputation of
men and he was responsible to no one
| but himself. After he had gained this
j tremendous power and had won a for
| tune he determined to attack, and if
| possible ruin, the very men who had
I assisted him to give him power and
money.
Late in 1892 he was determined to is
sue new bonds and crowd the McDon
alds out of the road completely. To
do this it was necessary for him to obt
tain the stock which Frank McDonald
as cashier of the Pacific Bank had.
I pooled with him. He went to New
I York with the deliberate and dishonest
j purpose of getting more money out of
I the McDonalds to support the danger
ous venture in which the young
banker had been caught. While decid
ing to crowd the McDonalds out alto
gether Sherman schemed also to make
$50,000 more out of them, and he went
to New York and made his cringing
plea that more money was absolutely
needed and he must obtain it or the
road would go down. He represented
the condition of affairs as most des
perate, and, as The Call has already
described, he procured $50,000 more.
He then began his gigantic scheme
to keep for himself the money which
the Pacific Bank now demands after a
period of almost six years. In order to
cheat Frank McDonald out of the stock
that had been pooled Sherman declared
that in order for him to continue the
operation of the ele#tric railroad it
would be necessary to assess the stock.
This assertion immediately frightened
Frank McDonald, who was doing every
thing in his power, even to the recourse
of desperate measures, to retain money
and not to give it up. He declared that
it would be absolutely impossible for
the Pacific Bank to pay such an enor
mous assessment at that time.
Sherman shrugged his shoulders and
declared that the young banker could
take the consequences. Having fright
ened Frank McDonald to the degree
he wished, Sherman proposed his two
schemes which the Pacific Bank now
declares was a most outrageous fraud.
Frank was told by Sherman that a
wealthy relative had agreed to loan the
Los Angeles Electric Railroad Company
$150,000 on the stock. Frank was de
llehted with this proposition, as it
seemed to clear the way for the dis
tressed bank. No more money certain
ly would have to be paid out at that
time and Frank's only regret was that
Sherman could %ot obtain more money
and give some to the bank. As a mat
ter of fact Sherman did not have a
lender for any of Vhe stock and did not
expect to meet one. He knew of no one
who wished to loan money on such se
curity, but he was scheming, craftily,
to get from Frank McDonald the 25,500
shares thaj had v^^ -ooled by the two
great parties to the contract.
When Sherman declared that he had
a person who would loan this enormous
sum of money he added that as a mat
ter of course the stock would have to
be placed iÂ« pledge with the lender of
the money. Frank accepted the schem
er's bait and telegraphed to B. O. Carr
to send on to the National Park Bank
of New York the fifty-one per cent of
the stock which the Pacific Bank and
Moses H. Sherman held in Joint inter
est. Sherman was progressing with
his cuÃtomary good luck. The stock
and the agreement of the pool were
sent on to New York and Sherman dis
covered, through legal advice, that his
title to all of the fifty-one per cent
of stock did not belong to him because
of the* secret contract that had been
made with the Pacific Bank through its
cashier, Frank V. McDonald.
Sherman informed the young banker
that as each of them possessed a halt
M. H. SHERMAN, THE MASTER SPIRIT OF THE CONSPIRACY
The sensational and startling expose of the secret history of the Pacific Bank reached a climax yesterday when suit was
filed by the Pacific Bank against Moses H. Sherman to recover one-quarter of a million dollars. The Pacific Bank
as a corporation and through its president, H. G. Meyer, alleges that Sherman has violated an important trust in
which he was to give the Pacific Bank one-half of 51 per cent of stock of the Los Angeles Electric Railroad. It is
asserted that Sherman appropriated all of the stock to his own use and now has disposed of it for five hundred
thousand dollars. The Pacific Bank, therefore, demands that one-half of this sum belonging to it shall be restored.
interest it would be necessary for both
of them to sign a joint note and thus
commit the bank again. Rather than
sign such a note Frank McDonald
agreed to turn over all of the 25,500
shares to Sherman. When the wily
conspirator had carried his point he
did not tarry long in New York. He
was soon on his way back to California
to -complete his arrangements for his
new bond deal in which he wished to
force the McDonalds out of the corpo
ration. The McDonalds had not dis
covered a single trick of the great
schemer.
While Sherman was in New York and
was showing Frank McDonald how ab
solutely necessary it was to obtain all
â of the stock that had been pooled the
arch-conspirator was far-seeing. He
secured from Frank McDonald a nomi
nal bill of sale for his half of the stock.
McDonald gave this bill of sale under
several distinct understandings. He
believed, because Sherman so repre
sented to him, that there was a chance
of securing a bona-flde loan with this
Btock as security. That assertion on
the^part of Sherman was a falsehood.
Frank McDonald then believed that if
he did not give a nominal bill of sale
he would have to sign his name to a
joint note with Sherman. The young
banker protested against this, and
Sherman declared that in consideration
of the fact that Frank McDonald gave
to him this nominal bill of sale Sher
man would sign the note himself,
pledge the entire 25,500 shares of stock,
receive the loan of $150,000 and place
the money to the advantage of the Los
Angeles Electric Railroad.
All of these assertions and promises
were absolute falsehoods. Sherman's
only scheme was to obtain possession
of the stock in order that he might
make a new bond issue for his road and
clean the McDonalds out.
This is the gigantic fraud upon which
the Pacific Bank will now base its de
mand for restitution of a quarter of a
million dollars. The correspondence and
the other collateral evidences of Sher
man's deceit will be produced in evi
dence, and it will be shown that the
great Bchemer received this nominal bill
of sale that gave him another great for
tune under the grossest misrepresenta
tion. As already indicated, when he had
obtained the 25,500 shares of stock and
Frank V. McDonald's nominal bill of
sale. Sherman left New York and hur
ried on his way to this city to complete
his plot and issue his new bonds. As
usual, he was successful in his machin-
ations.
A new bond issue was made of $3,000,
000, -vith $250,000 on the side, ostensibly
for the improvement of the road. The
company in this gigantic conspiracy
was even to change its name. From
being the Los Angeles Consolidated
Electric Railroad Company it was to
become the Los Angeles Railroad Com
pany. Under the new deal Sherman
had a great many influences to control.
There was considerable dissatisfaction
with his management of the road. It
was said that ha had not acted fairly
with the bondholders and there was
some suggestion of a change of man
agement. Sherman propitiated the va
rious interests and was equal to every
emergency that presented itself. He de
clared that he would surrender the con
trolling interest in the road and w ? ould
give over for distribution among the
bondholders 51 per cent of the stock.
If he would do this in good faith the
bondholders would then control the
road, elect its directors, choose its man- j
agers and supervise the expenditure of
its funds; but Sherman, as usual, was
deceiving. Under the terms of his own
agreement he was to retain 49 per cent
of the stock and thus be in an apparent
minority. As a matter of fact, how
ever, under the terms of this agree
ment, which was accepted, Sherman
succeeded in still retaining 51 per cent
of the stock, and consequently a control
of the railroad. As a stockholder he
held 49 per cent of the stock, and as a
bondholder he was entitled to 2 per
cent on the terms of distribution among
bondholders, which he had proposed,
and the men with whom he was dealing
had accepted.
It was not until after the first board
of directors was chosen that the shrewd
financiers understood the knavery of
Moses H. Sherman. When this board ol
directors was elected it was found that
six of the nine members represented
the interests of Moses H. Sherman.
This was one of the cleverest and
craftiest schemes that Sherman ever
accomplished in his manipulation of
the Los Angeles Electric Railroad, and
in its accomplishment he went even
further than has already been indi
cated. He received from the men he
had duped $40,000 as a bonus for bring
ing about the reorganization of the^
company and for tooling the bond
holders into a belief that he had given
up to them the control of the road.
In outline this is the history of the
great scheme by . which the Pacific
Bank now claims that Moses H. Sher
man cheated its creditors out of one
half of 51 per cent of the capital stock
of the electric railroad. The bank as
serts that during all these proceedings
and in all these transactions Sherman
was acting as the trustee of the Pacific
Bank and not in his individual capac*
ity. The president of the bank, in th?
complaint which was filed yesterday,
declares that Sherman has violated
this trust and had since disposed of
the pooled stock interests for $000,000.
The bank therefore sues for an ac
counting and for $250,000. The com
plaint in which these various allega
tions are made is an interesting docu
ment and is given in full, as follows:
LEGAL SUMMONS FOR
SHERMAN TO DISGORGE
In the Superior Court of the City and
County of San Francisco, State of
California,
Pacific Bank (a corporation),
Plaintiff,
vs.
Moses H. Sherman,
Defendant.
I.
For cause of action against the
PEICE FIVE CENTS.
above named defendant this plaintiff
avers :
That this plaintiff is and at all the
times' hereafter mentioned or referred
to, was a corporation duly organised
and existing under the laws of the
State of California, and as such had
the legal right to transact business in
said State.
11.
That on or about the first day of OÂ»
tober, A. D. 1889. this plaintiff and thÂ«
said, defendant were together the e<suaJ
owners of 25,500 shares of the capital
stock of the Los Angeles Consolidated
Electric Railway Company, a corpora
tion duly organized and existing under
the laws of the Territory of Arizona,
which said 2f>,500 shares of capital
stock was of a par value of $2,550,000
and constituted fifty-one per cent of
the whole of the capital stock of sold
last named corporation.
That for the purpose of securing and
maintaining control and management
of the affairs of the said Los Angeles
Consolidated Electric Railway Com
pany, this plaintiff and said defend
ant made an agreement whereby the
said 25,500 shares of said capital stock
were placed in the hands of one B. O.
Carr, a brother-in-law of said defend
ant, to be by him. the said Carr, held
and voted in and for the interests of
this plaintiff and said defendant, for a>
term of ten years.
111.
That on or about the Ist day of No
vember, 1892, and while the said shares
of stock were so held, the said defend
ant represented to the officers and
agents of this plaintiff that the said
Los Angeles Consolidated Railway
Company was in financial distress and
required money, although a large in
debtedness of said company had al
ready been created, and bonds there
for had been issued, and although this
plaintiff had, prior to that time, ad
vanced to the said Railway Company
more than $300,000 for the purpose of
constructing and carrying on its
works and operations; and further
represented that it would be necessary
to levy an assesment on the stock of
said Railway Company in order to
meet its liabilities and expenses unless
some other arrangement could be
made, and in order to avoid the neces
sity of so levying and collecting an as
sessment said defendant represented
and stated to this plaintiff that he,
the said defendant, had a friend,
whose name was not given, who would
advance and loan the necessary mon
eys, to wit: the sum of one hundred
and fifty thousand dollars, to relieve
the, necessities of said Railway Com
pany and would hold the said 25,500
shares of stock so belonging to plain
tiff and defendant as collateral secur
ity for the advances so to be made and
that when such advances should be re
paid out of the earnings of the said
Railway Company or otherwise, that
said shares of stock should and would
be returned to this plaintiff or its trus
tee as aforesaid, and upon such repre
sentations the defendant procured and
induced the agent of this plaintiff to
surrender and deliver to him, said de
fendant, the whole of the said 25,500
shares of said capital stock.
Said defendant did not hypothecate,
the said shares as he has pro->
posed as aforesaid, and did not borrow
any money thereon or otherwise to re
lieve the necessities of said railway
corporation, but simply by the means
aforesaid obtained tho possession of the
said 25,500 shares of stock for his own
uses and purposes and with intent to
defraud and cheat this plaintiff out of
its interest therein and share thereof.
And this plaintiff avers that the said
defendant Wcame and was and is the
trustee of this plaintiff of and for its
said one-half interest of, in and to thÂ«
said 26,500 shares of stock and he has
ever since held, managed and con
trolled the same until on or about the
Ist day of August, A. D. 1894. when
Bald defendant exchanged the said 25,
500 shares of stock for other stocks
and obligations which he, the said de
fendant, lias, *xs this plaintiff la !>â¢2
- formed and believes, since sold and
disposed of and for which he has re
â  ceived in payment certain . moneys,
bonds, stocks and securities of the
value of $500,000. And this plaintiff fur
ther avers that the said defendant
now has and holds in his hands as
trustee for this plaintiff, and as the
proceeds of the said half interest in
said 25.500 shares, the one-half of the
said moneys, bonds, stocks and se
curities'so taken by him in exchange
therefor, as aforesaid, the exact na
ture of which this plaintiff docs not
and "cannot aver because the knowl
edge thereof has been kept, by the
defendant and concealed from this
plaintiff, but the value of which, as
this plaintiff is informed and believes,
is not less than $250,000.
IV.
And this plaintiff further avers that
during all . the time that the said
stocks were so â¢ held in trust by the
said Carr and during all the time that
-the said defendant has held said stocks
as aforesaid, he, the said defendant,
managed, .controlled and manipulated
the affairs of the said Los Angeles
Consolidated Electric Railway Com
pany so that no dividends were
paid upon the said shares of
â¢took, and while the said rail
way company was not ' paying and
did not pay its bonded indebtedness or
the interest thereon the said defendant
made and realized large sums of money
out of his management of the said
property, the said defendant during
: that time being In receipt of not less
than $50,000 per month of income from
the operations of the property of said
railway company. That the ownership
of the said 25,500 shares being fifty-one
per cent of a majority of the entire
capital stock of the said railway com
pany, so held and owned by said plain
tiff and said defendant, enabled said
defendant under the aforesaid arrange
ment, to manage and control the af
fairs thereof, and this plaintiff was
and is entitled to one-half of all sums
and amounts realized, had and ob
tained by him. the said defendant,
through and by means of the opera
tions and management of the said
railway over and above operating ex
penses. The aforesaid averments are
on my information and belief and I
believe the same to be true.
. That as this plaintiff is informed and
believes; said defendant, while so in
the management of the affairs of said
Railway Company and while handling
and controlling the income and funds
thereof, misappropriated and used the
funds thereof and invested the same
In other property and enterprises, the
exact nature of which are unknown to
this plaintiff, and converted and used
large sums of such moneys for his
own use and benefit, one-naif of all
of which belonged to this plaintiff and
of which said defendant became and
was and is the trustee of and for this
plaintiff.
Wherefore this plaintiff prays that
an accounting be had between said de
fendant and this plaintiff of all the
business transactions between them
and particularly of and concerning the
said 25,500 shares of capital stock of
the Los Angeles Consolidated Electric
Railway Company, and of all sums,
amounts, properties, stocks, bonds, or
other thing of value received by said
defendant for,- in exchange for, or upon
the sale or disposition of the said
shares 1 or any part thereof, and of all
-sums of money in any received by
said defendant as the trustee of or for
this plaintiff, and of all Stocks, bonds,

H. G. MEYER,
The alleged disposition of Sherman's |
Interest in the Los Angeles Electric j
Road was made to the Southern Pa- ,
clfic Company very recently. In the |
complaint it is alleged that Sherman, j
while acting as trustee for the. Pacific j
Bank, during a period of four years,
appropriated to himself much of the
property and the earnings of the road.
During that time Sherman operated ab
solutely without the necessity of ac
counting to any one. The bondholders
sacrificed the interest on the investment
and Sherman used the earnings of the
road as he pleased. It is stated, in the
complaint, that the net profits of the
road average $50,000 a month, and the
Pacific Bank now demands from Moses
H. Sherman a strict accounting for that
money. It will be shown at the trial
that during this time Moses H. Sher
man secured a franchise for a road to
Pasadena and Santa Monica over the
tracks of the Los Angeles Electric
Road.
He built this new road out of the
earnings of the Los Angeles road, and
he to-day retains absolute possession of
them, not only for the profits they
bring to him, but as a weapon of com
petition that may be used at any mo
ment to fight the Los Angeles road. It
is claimed also that out of the earnings
of the Los Angeles Electric road Sher
tt"--- built his Phoenix Electric road.
This concern was at first a horsecar
line, which Sherman extravagantly
bonded for $66,000. When machinery,
dynamos and motors and other ma
terlal were taken from the Los Angeles

Electric Railroad to the Fhoenix con
cern, Sherman increased the bond in
debtedness of the Phoenix road to $166,
000, and made the People's Home Sav
ings Bank take the additional $100,000
in worthless bonds. It will be remem
bered that Sherman's accommodating
relative, John E. Farnum, forced the
McDonalds to accept these bonds.
This is some of the evidence that will
be presented to force M. H. Sherman to
an accounting of his alleged trustee
ship. The Pacific P.ank has therefore
good reasons to believe that in forcing
from Moses H. Sherman a quarter of
a million dollarÃ of his ill-gotten gains,
and in demanding from him a strict
accounting of his operations, the
creditors of the bank will have restored
to them dollar for dollar.
It was the purpose of The Call in
publishing the long s'-ries of stories ex
posing the secret history of the bank
to assist these creditors to a realiza
tion of their hopes of restitution. The
Call has for the present concluded its
long expose. Man: of the most im
portant documents of the Pacific Bank
have not been published for the simple
reason that they will be necessary as
evidence in the le<?al actions that have
been undertaken to restore to their
rightful owners the misappropriated
property of the bank.
RUNJVING DOWN
THE PLUNDER
Suit Filed to Force Moses
H. Sherman to Dis
gorge.
The history of the great bank loot
has not been written in vain. Through
the pages of that plain, unvarnished
tale the victims are looking backward
over the work of as unconscionable a
gang of scoundrels as ever called "Stand
and deliver!" By the telling of a simple
story the blade of Justice gleams aveng
ingly and by that gleam daylight shows
down the dark road, whither went the
plunderers with their golden booty.
Each column of narrative as told in The
Call has been as a broad highway over
which the minions of the law are, at
last, hurrying toward their cowering
prey. Â»
'The Call," said an attorney for the
depositors last evening, "made clear
the way. The present managers of the
Pacific Bank were fairly well satisfied
where and how the funds went. But
the light shed by The Call showed the
ways and means, and the management
is now moving to recover at least some
of the stolen funds."
Late yesterday afternoon a com
plaint was tiled by the law firm of Den
son, Oatman & Denson in behalf of the
Pacific Bank against Moses H. Sher
man to recover one-half of 25,500 shares
of stock loaned to- Sherman â or rather
squeezed by Sherman out of the bank.
The suit also s^eks to have Sherman
adjudged a trusree in the matter of
the shares and to require him to ac
count for them.
Judge Denson stated last evening
that there was an abundance of docu
mentary evidence as well .is witnesses
to prove all set forth in the complaint.
The disclosures published exclusively
in the Call, he averred, have brought
back the whole matter to public no
tice and not only that, but have given
j testimony not to be doubted. The pres
ent managers of the bank, he stated,
were pursuing an inquiry slowly along
these lines when The Call turned the
light of day upon a wonderful revela
tion. Judge E. D. Sawyer, one of the
attorneys for the Pacific Bank, made
in substance the same statement, and
expressed the same unbounded confi
dence in the ultimate outcome of the
suit and the complete disgorgement of
at least Moses H. Sherman.
Judge S. C. Denson gave the follow
ing substance of the complaint which
contains the story of the bank's ad-
vance to Sherman of funds for the re
"' lief of his Los Angeles Consolidated
Electric Railroad:
"Sherman was the organizer, or at
least, one of the early managers of the
i Los Angeles Consolidated Electric Rail-
I road Company, and was backed In the
1 scheme financially by the Pacific Bank
j under the McDonald management. Th-, :
! company issued bonds upon its prop- i
j erty for money to construct its lines \
I and to fully equip them. The bank !
I advanced money, taking some of the
, railroad bonds as security to the extent
of over $300,000. As a part of the ar-
r angement between Sherman and the
' bank it was agreed that a majority of
! the stock, that is, 51 per cent, or 25,509
! shares, should be controlled by the
bank and Sherman. â  And to that end
j that amount of stock was placed in thÂ«
hands of B. O. Carr, Sherman's broth
er-ir^'aw. The 49 per cent of stock, of
' 24,500 shares, were to be disposed of to
other people.
[ "Presently Sherman reported to the
bank that more money was wanted.
That institution, under the McDonald
: system of princely spendings, was : be
; ginning to feel a squeeze and objected
Ito this further drain. Sherman said
â¢ the money must come, and threatened
I to levy an assessment - on- the stock,
which the bank would have to pay, but
finally, proposed that if the managers
would . deposit, with him the 51 per cent
!of stock, the 25,500 shares, he had a
i friend who ; would advance $150,000.
i This stock was to be returned to the
bank when the ' $150,000 was paid out
of the proceeds or earnings of the rail
road or otherwise.
"Sherman got possession of the stock,
but did not procure the loan; neither
I did he return the stock. In 1894. by rep
| resenting himself, as the owner of all
j that stock, he made a new deal in
! which he procured other stocks and
bonds upon the surrender of the orig
i inal stock. Within the present year he
has sold those stocks and bonds, so the
bank is Informed,', for $500,000.
" "This suit Is to adjudge him a trustee
to the extent of one-half. of the 25,500
shares of the original stock and to re
quire him to account for the profits and
proceeds of the same. T It is confidently
expected that the bank will recover a
Judgment of not less than $250,000. The
evidence produced seems to me amply
sufficient to establish the averments
j and the bank ought to recover the en
tire sum." â  ' â¢ y".',..y ".',..

SHERMAN, OF COURSE,
SAYS IT IS NOTHING
LOS ANGELES. Nov. 30.â M. H. Sher
man was seen to-nifrht at Hotel West
minster and Informed that Henry Meyer,
president of Pacific Bank, had filed
suit against him to recover value of a
half-interest in 25,500 shares of stock
in the Los Angeles Consolidated Electric
Railway Company. Sherman said that
there was absolutely nothing in the
suit. Further than that he declined to
speak. ______________

NEW YORK REGIMENT
WILL SOON COME HOME;
I
VICTORIA, B. C, Nov. 30.â The New
York regiment will shortly be in San
Francisco on their way home from (
Honolulu, according to. news received i
this evening by the Miowera, Five
hundred men were to leave on the
steamer Australia on November 29, and i
300 more were to follow in a few days !
by the steamer Alameda.
The troops hnve suffered frightfully '
from typhoid fever, there being, ac- j
cording to one of the Honolulu papers, ;
as many as 300 cases. In Company E i
there were, when the Miowera left, but
ten men fit for duty. The list of sick
grows rapidly. On November 23 Com
pany A sent sixteen to the hospital.
Shortly before the steamer Miowera,
A JEWESS FOR LOVE'S SAKE.
Miss Jessie Rowena Taylor Becomes a Proselyte to
Gratify Her Husband.
THOU art sanctified to me according tp the law of Moses and Israel."
These words were' breathed by Herman Cohn "to the woman who
was formerly a gentile, as they stood before Ka-bbi N. Mosossohn and
participated in the solemn Jewish ceremonies which made them man
and wife, according to the teachings of the Israelite. The words made all
parties interested happy save one, and that one is the mother of the bride,
who from the llrst opposed the Idea of her daughter becoming a proselyte.
On September 20 of this year Miss Jessie Rowena Taylor, aged 19 years,
became the bride of Herman Cohn, aged 35. She being a Christian the
ceremony at that time was performed in a manner prescribed by her.
They took up their abode with his parents, 462 Tehama street, and since
that time every effort has been made Jn the household to Induce the young
girl to embrace the faith of her husband. She declined to listen to their
requests at first, but appealÃ so pathetic reached her that she relented and
decided to exist with her husband In thought and belief. Her mother Im
plored her to reconsider her. decision, but she remained firm. The mother
was asked to attend the ceremonies, at which her daughter would relin
quish the creed in which she had been born, but she declined.
Last evening at 7 o'clock a large congregation assembled In the Congre
gation Chebra Tehlllim to witness the ceremonies. The bride first re
leased all claim upon the Christian faith. She answered the rabbi that
she did so freely and voluntarily and was not actuated by a fear that her
husband would desert her should she remain outside the flock. Nothing in
all her answers would indicate that her husband or any of his family had
ever urged her to become one of them. She had been baptized earlier in
the day, but the ceremonies are formal and not counted as much by the
Jews.
At half-past 7 the canopy was spread over the man and woman, whose
previous marriage had been annulled, and they accepted all the condi
tions that will make their belief in God in unison until death. She was
given the name of Ruth and must cast aside her pretty appellation of Jes
sie Rowena. She is the first proselyte in this congregation, and there are
but few in the city.
I which reached here this evening, left
Honolulu two ships came into port with
flags at half-mast. The ship C. F. Sar
gent lost her first officer, William
Noring. to the sharks, and the Planter
arrived with her captain, F. A. Dow,
lying dead, he having died of dysentery.
His body was preserved in brine and
will be shipped to San Francisco, where
he is well known, for interment.
The sailing of the transport Newport
from Honolulu on November 16 was
made the occasion for a demonstration.
There was an immense crowd on the
wharf to bid the soldiers farewell.
Three days later another demonstra
tion occurred at the wharf, the occasion
being the departure of the transport
Pennsylvania for Manila with the Kan
sas troops.
The Miowera brought news that the
steamship Columbia had been con
1 demned at Hilo by a board of survey.
PREPARATORY
TO SIGNING
PEACE TREATY
Commissioners Dis
cuss Articles.
THREE ARE AGREED UPON
EMBRACE CTJBA, PORTO RICO,
GUAM AND PHILIPPINES.
Remaining Matters for Consideration
Include Release of Political
Prisoners and Religious
Freedom.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, Nov. 30.â The United States
Peace Commission held a session to
day for the purpose of discussing the
draft of the treaty articles made yes
terday by Secretaries Moore and Ojeda.
The final preparation of these articles
was concluded and the revised draft
was then turned over to the typewrit
ers, while the Commissioners hastily
lunched prior to the hour fixed for the
Joint session.
The Spaniards arrived first at the
conference chamber. They were quick
ly followed by the American Commis
sioners, with the exception of Judge
Day and Secretary Moore, who waited
for the prepared copy of the articles,
and who arrived at the conference half
an hour later.
The two commissions then began the
discussion of the formulated protocol
agreements and the subjects for ne
gotiation, all of which were presented
to the joint commission in a form ac
ceptable to the Americans.
The joint Commissioners devoted two
hours and a half â from 2 to 4:30 p. m. â
to drafting the three first articles of
the peace treaty protocol, dealing with
the cession of Cuba, Porto Rico and
the Philippines, upon which the mem
bers agreed in principle.
There were thirteen articles laid be
fore the two commissions, covering the
following subjects:
1. The relinquishment of. sovereignty
over and claim of title to Cuba.
2. The cession of Porto Rico and other
Spanish possessions* in the West Indies,
together with Guam, in the Ladrones.
3. The cession of the Philippines.
4. The terms of the evacuution of the
Philippines.
5. The pledge of the United States to
preserve order In the Philippines pending
the ratification of the treaty.
6. The release of military prisoners mu
tually.
7. The cession by Spain of the Island
of Kuhae, or Strong Island, In the Caro
lines.
8. The mutual relinquishment of indem
nity claims.
9. The religious freedom of the Caro
lines, assuring the rights of American
missionaries there.
10. Cable landing rights at points within
the Spanish jurisdiction.
11. The release by Spain of political
prisoners for offenses in Cuba and the
Philippines.
12. The pledge of the United Btates to
inaugurate in the Philippines an "open,
door" policy and to guarantee the same
to Spain for at least twelve years.
12. A revival of the treaties broken by
the war.
The first three articles were mutually
agreed upon to-day, as was also the
article embodying the terms of the
evacuation of the Philippines, which
will be practically the same as in the
evacuation of Cuba and Porto Rico.
The mutual release of military pris
oners was agreed upon, Spain liber
ating the rebel prisoners and the United
States liberating the Manila garrison
and the Spaniards held by Aguinaldo.
The political prisoners to be released
by Spain are such as are now in exile
at Ceuta in Morocco or at other Span
ish penal settlements.
Daily sessions will be held here, and
it is now believed that the work will
be possibly concluded this week, al
though so early a termination is not
probable.
The foregoing list of subjects under
consideration does not show the precise
order in which the articles were laid
before the Spanish Commissioners to
day, and in fact only eight of the thir
teen articles were discussed. Four
points arose about which the Spaniards
desired to consult Madrid and two upon
which the Americans will consult with
Washington. ,
After the session and the departure of
the Spanish Commissioners the Ameri
cans remained in the conference cham
ber for an hour in executive session.
The adjournment was taken until 3
o'clock to-morrow.
TAYLOR CRITICIZES THE
SETTLEMENT WITH SPAIN
NEW YORK, Nov. 80.â Hannis Tay
lor, late American Minister to Spain,
publishes In the December number of
the North American Review a scathing
criticism of the work of the American
Peace Commission. Taylor contends
that in the negotiations with Spain re
specting Cuba, Porto Rico and the Phil
ippines the members of the commission
should have been guided by the prece
dent establishd by this country In its
dealing with Mexico after the victorious
issue of the Mexican war. Then, hesays,

our feet, to take from her a single
square mile of territory by right of con
PANAMA CANAL LOBBY
BUSY AT WASHINGTON
Will Make Accusations to Mr. McKinley
Against the Maritime Company
of Nicaragua.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 30.â A sensation is promised to-morrow
morning, when the delegation of Panama canal people will call on
President McKinley. President Hutton and Messrs. Sullivan, Curtin
and Palmer of the Panama Canal Company have an appointment
with the President. The Call correspondent learned to-night that
these representatives will not only offer to sell to the United States
the Panama canal "ditch" as thus far constructed, but will make
some charges against the Maritime Canal Company of Nicaragua.
There promises to be an interesting campaign over the canal this
session. Several weeks ago The Call correspondent was advised by
letter from Costa Rica that President Iglesias would soon visit Wash
ington, and tÂ£at a "powerful Panama canal lobby" would be here in
the endeavor' to defeat the Nicar^ffua company. The delegation that
will call on President McKinley to-morrow is doubtless the "lobby"
referred to.
STEAMER SUNK
IN KOOTENAI LAKE
Of the Twelve PersoQS Aboard
the Ainsworth but Three
F^each Shore.
VICTORIA, Nov. 30.â News reached
here this afternoon of the loss of the
steamer Ainsworth, which plied be
tween Kaslo, Nelson and other points
on Kootenai River and Lake. She was
swamped during the terrific galÂ»s which
swept this province last night about
five miles south of Balfour, and all on
board, save the captain, chief engineer
and a seaman, who reached shore in
the lifeboat, were drowned. The vic
tims numbered nine in all, three of
whom were passengers.
The Ainsworth left Nelson last even
ing on her usual trip despite the fierce
gales and made good time, the wind be
ing behind her, until when off about six
miles south of Pilot Bay, where the big
Pilot Bay smelters are located. There
the winds veered and caught her on
the starboard side. She was about two
and a half miles from shore, when, dur
ing a heavy sea, a great squall struck
her, and she commenced to take in
water.
Water poured into her hold through
the seams, which opened until her hull
was like a sieve. Captain McLean im
mediately headed her for the shore and
she raced at full speed toward the land,
the intention being to run her ashore
before she could founder. The water
poured into the doomed vessel too rap
idly and before she had gone a half
quest. Our Commissioners were In
structed to offer her $11,000,000 in cash
and the assumption upon our part of
more than $3,000,000 due from her to
American citizens, as compensation for
the area out of which has been car veil
California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah and
New Mexico.
"And thus," says Taylor, "was estab
lished a new principle of moral iaw,
which stands alone, perhaps, in the an
nals of nations."
RELEASE OF PRISONERS
AND TARIFF ADVANTAGES
MADRID, Nov. 30.â The Cabinet's In
structions to Senor Montero Rios,
which were drawn up last evening,
were to request the immediate release
of the Spanish prisoners in the Philip
pine Islands, to negotiate navigation
and tariff advantages in the Philippines
In favor of Spain, to obtain a ratifica
tion of several treaties of commerce
with former Spanish possessions; also
an arrangement of the debt of the
Philippines and if possible of the Cu
ban debt. The Government also agreed
to refuse a ratification of the protocol
of 1877.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 30.â The proto
col of 1877, which the Spanish Govern
ment has notified her Commissioners
not to revive, is the celebrated Cush
ing protocol which has been a source of
much corespondence between the two
Governments, and was Invoked by this
Government a number of times prior to
the "outbreak of hostilities. The proto
col was framed with special reference
to the outbreaks in Caba against Spain
and now that she has lost nearly all of
her colonies and especially those near
our soil, has not its former importance
to the United States. Its aim was to
guarantee our citizens protection
against summary and secret legal pro
ceedings. Its first clause, which is fair
ly descriptive of the whole protocol,
provides that no citizen of the United
States residing in Spain or her island
possessions charged with conspiracy
against the Government or any other
crime shall be subject to trial by any
exceptional tribunal unless captured
with arms in hand, but instead shall be
tried exclusively by the ordinary legal
jurisdiction.
NICARAGUA'S GRANT TO
THE GRACE SYNDICATE
NE"W YORK, Nov. 30.â There has been
much curiosity in financial circles about
the terms of the recent grant of the Gov
ernment of Nicaragua to the Willis ;.i R.
Grace syndicate of a secondary franchise
to construct a canal through that coun
try from tidewater to tidewater.
Through the courtesy of William R.
Grace the terms of the concession are
now made public. After stating in the
preamble that the Government of Nicar
agua regards an interoceanic canal
through the Nicaraguan Isthmus to be
necessary, article I reads:
"The Government of the State of Nicar
agua permits Messrs. Edward Eyre and
Edward F. Cragin to enter into negotia
tions with the Maritime Canal Company
of Nicaragua for the purpose of obtaining
the immediate rescission of the contract
for constructing an interoceanic canal
known as the Cardenas-Menocal contract,
and dated April 24, 1597, which contract
shall terminate October 9, 1899."
In consideration of this grant the
srrantees agree to form within six months
after Messrs. Eyre and Cragin "notify
the Government of Nicaragua that the
Cardenas-Menocal contract has been re
scinded, or within six months following
the day upon which said contract shall
have ceased from any cause save that of
rescision, to organize the Interoceanic
Canal Company."
Throughout the grant the express stipu
lation is mode by the Nicaragua Govern
ment that the rights under me franchise
cannot be accepted until after it has been
established that the Cardenas-Menocal
contract has expired.

The Ainsworth was a sternwheel
steamer, 100 feet long and of twenty
feet beam. She was owned by Braden
Brothers of the Pilot Bay Smelter. For
eight years she has been running on
Kootenai Lake. She has been tied up
for some time past and was considered
by the majority of the navigators, of
Kootenai district an unsafe vessel.
Two well-known shipping men from
that district, who are now in this city,
said to-day that the news of her loss
did not come to them as a surprise.
They expected it long ago.
There are persistent rumors of the
loss of , another of the sternwheelers
running on Kootenai Lake, but no veri
fication of the reports can be obtained.

PROVINCETOWN. Mass., Nov. 30.â
The steamship Portland, plying be
tween Boston and Portland, was swal
lowed by the sea in last Sunday's
Btorm off Highland.
Of all the ship's company of over 100
Bouls not one survived, and the story of
the disaster will never be told. Sixteen
bodies have come ashore, and it is not
likely that many more will be recov
ered.
Following is a list of the bodies
washed ashore on the outside coast of
Cupe Cod up to midnight to-night:

F^ptham could not be obtained here to
night.
The exact number of persons who
were carried away from Boston by the
Portland will probably never be known,
as no list of passengers was retained on
sbore when the vessel left on Saturday.
Many estimates of the number on :
board have been made, but the esti
mates seldom agree. C. F. Williams of
Boston, aut-nt of the Portland Steam- â 
ship Company, places the total number !
of persons on the steamer at 100, or;
possibly 105. This estimate, however, is
generally, regarded as rather small. It
has b^en stated that the number was
as high as liir>, but Mr. Williams denies
that so many sailed on the Portland. It
Is probable that 120, including passen
gers and crew, is near the correct num
ber.
Neatly every tea captain and mariner
on the cape on being asked for an opin
ion, states that every one on board un
druyMprlly was lost. One feature of the
d:. c Ht-r is the absence of any frag
ments of a lifeboat or liferaft among the
mass "i Â).â¢< kagi; from the Portland,
which has been washed ashore. One
theory is that the boats and llferafte
were carried far out to sea and were
not blown anywhere near the coast.
Old mariners say they cannot under
stand v.hy the steamer, which, about
" k Saturday night, just before the
pale broke in its full fury, was sighted
een Thatchers Island and Eastern
Point, f'app Ann, by the schooner Maud
P.. 'lid not put into Gloucester harbor,
when it was apparent from the 2n\\ at
the barometer that a violent north
easter was approaching. Why the
Portland ever left Boston at all Satur

day night is what puzzles marine men |
on Cape Cod.
The crew of the Race Point life-say-
Ing station, which is located at the tip
of Cape Cod, reports that on Sunday ;
morning, during the height of the
storm, it heard four sharp whistles
from a steamer, which was recognized '
as a .danger signal. The signal was
heard at about 7:45 o'clock and the I
crew hastily mannfd the boats to give |
assistance if possible. The weather j
was so thick that it was impossible to ;
see any distance off shore. The crew !
could locate no steamer and the blasts \
of a whistle were heard only onca The
men are now of the opinion tnat it
came from the Portland some time be- .
fore she foundered, for it is generally
believed that she went to the bottom
and was not wrecked by going ashore, j
The opinion is also general here that
the boat was gradually battered to!
pieces by the mountainous seas, the up- :
per fittings being carried away until
the water began to pour into her. The
fact that her wheel was found, with
ropes attached, on the Orleans shore,
is taken to indicate that the pilots
were powerless to control the vessel's
course in the bay and that they were i
obliged to lash the wheel.
The absence of any very large sec- '
tions of wreckage from the Portland on i
the coast is accounted for by the the
ory that the hull itself went to the bot- ;
torn. The largest piece of wreckage j
reported up to sunset was a piece about
thirty feet long. Before the 111-fated
steamer took her final plunge the pas- '
sengers and crew, it would seem, '
adopted all means at their command to
save their lives, as is shown by the !
large number of life preservers and ,
belts found among the first portions of |
the wreckage.
The first body from the wreck came j
HIGHLAND LIGHT, CAPE COD.
It Was in the Vicinity of This Point That the Portland Is Supposed to Have Been Wrecked.
ashore at High Head, which is a few
miles farther down the outer coast
of the cape from the Peaked Hill sta
tion. The next bodies found were pick
ed up at points farther south on the
same day and the life preservers, wood
work, two or three pieces of baggage*
lard, \ tobacco, < paper and other stuff
from the cargo began to pile up on the
shore south of High Head. Little
wreckage was found north â  of that
i point. . The swift undertow off shore
carried an immense amount of debris
and many bodies south as far as Mo
nonomoy Beach and Nantucket Sound.
The northern limit indicates that the
wreck was near High Head.
Large numbers of â¢ volunteers, in
cluding several persons -who had
friends or relatives on board /the
steamer, assisted the surf men; in pa
trolling the beaches. From the tin end
of Cape Cod to Mononomoy there are
1 ten Government life , saving stations,
and all. the crews have been on duty
, almost constantly since last Saturday
i evening, when the great. blow set in.
On Monday and yesterday several
bodies were sighted in the surf some
' distance from' shore, but they disap
peared from view before they could be
secured.
The body of a man at an undertaking
room here is supposed to be that of
"tt'illiam Mother. :\ business man of
Oorham. Me. A body believed to be
that of John Walton, second engineer
of the Portland, came ashore off Nauset
ysterday.

RECEIVES THE NEWS
THAT HIS SON PERISHED
George E. Kennlston of Boothbay,
Me., who with his wife and daughter
arrived In this city last night and reg
istered at the Palace, heard the sad
news that his son, George E.
ton Jr., had perished with the Bteamer
Portland, which went down with all on
board off Cape Cod. The boy was only
19 years of age. He was a student at
Bowdoin College, and left there to
spend Thanksgiving with his sister at
Hyde Park. He started back and took
the Saturday night steamer, which in
tended to make an eight-hour run
from Boston to Portland.
The father got an inkling of the fate
of his son while on the road, and at
Truckee he received a dispatch that
confirmed his worst fears.
The unfortunate affair has proved a
great shock to the family, and instead
of proceeding to Los Angeles, as they
had intended, they will return to their
desolated home immediately.
The senior Kenniston is at present
Judge of Probate and Insolvency at
Boothbay, and was a classmate of E.
S. Pillsbury and S. D. Waterman, presi
dent of Berkeley High School, at Bow
doin College.
STORM'S VICTIMS
NUMBER HUNDREDS
BOSTON, Nov. 30.â News of the loss
of the Boston and Portland Steam
Packet Company's steamer Portland off
Cape Cod and the death of more than
120 persons, comprising the passengers
and crew of the steamer, and news
from hitherto unheard from ports in
Cape Cod showing that at least a score
and a half of vessels were wrecked
along that shore with the loss of
twelve lives, has come as a dire climax
to the previous report of disasters re
sulting from Saturday night's storm.
There are still other places to be
heard from on both sides of the cape,
which have not been reached by train
on account of washouts and which are
cut off from other means of communi
cation by broken wires, blocked high
ways and shattered bridges.
Up to this morning, while the total
loss of life cannot be estimated with
any degree of accuracy, it is known
that more than 200 persons have per
ished. This estimate is made on the
basis of only one for each crew report
ed missing, each of which would In
clude at least three, while the larger
schooners would have seven or eight
men on board.
Attempt to estimate the financial
losses sustained by shipping interests
is equally difficult from facts in hand,
but it appears that the bulk of the
damage was done between ('ape Ann.
where a score or more of vessels were
lost, and Cuttyhunk, where the steamer
â¢ Warwick is on the rocks.
From present reports it is known that
fifty-six vessels have been totally
wrecked, while forty-nine are ashore,
\vith hardly a chance of being saved.
Of the fifty-six total wrecks, barges not
included, forty-three craft aggregate
12,200 gross tonnage. Of those in peril
ous positions twenty-eight aggregate
7159 tons. The stranding of the big
English liner Ohio and the ocean tug
Tamaqua are not included in the esti
mate given, nor many of the big coal
barges ashore in Boston harbor. The
position of these latter craft Is now
dangerous, for they are exposed to the
northeast storm, which began this
morning,.
The number of schooners which have
been driven ashore in fairly safe berths
cr ha\e been damaged by collision or
dismasted can be reckoned by the
scores and many of them are likely to
be included in the list of total wrecks
before the day ends.
STORM RENEWED IN
NEW ENGLAND STATES
BOSTON, Nov. 30.â Another heavy
nortlieast snowstorm started here Just
before 7 o'clock this morning and an
hour later had settled down in a way
that promised several inches of snow at
least. A brisk wind of twenty miles an
hour was blowing from north-nor.th
east. These conditions will greatly in
terfere with the work that is being
done at points where vessels were
wrecked, as the sea is running high
and the snow is blinding on the water.
Passengers on the north and south
shore trains report that the wind is
blowing a gale along the shore. At Co
hasset and other points further down
the south shore it rained in torrents
about 6 o'clock, and the streets were
flooded with water and melting snow.
This storm promises to complete the
wreck among the shipping along the
shore.
FLOATING EVIDENCE
OF A BIG WRECK
PORTSMOUTH, Mass., Nov. 30.â A
body found yesterday morning on the
outside beach near Powder Point bridge
by the Gurnet life-saving crew, clad in
oilskins, marked "Haley," is. thought
to be that of one of the four Norwell
men, reported missing from their shoot-
ing box near the mouth of North River.
A six-foot steering wheel, a spar sev
enty-five feet long, wiih rigging at
tached, and what appeared io be the
front of a quarterdeck house or the
side of a steamer's stateroom, are re
ported floating in the water off shore
near Brant Rock. They are thought to
have come from some deep-sea ship
wrecked further up the coast.
FATE OF A BARGE
CREW IN DOUBT
BOSTON, Nov. 30.â The steamer Ori
on, Captain Smith, reached here this
morning after an eventful passage from
Newport News, during which she lost
the barges Ocean Belle for Providence
and the Enos Soule for this port. The
crew of the Ocean Belle, four men.
were saved. The fate of those on the
Soule is not known.

HAVANA, Nov. 30.â General Portu
ondo, President of the Cuban Assem
bly, who is of all prominent Cubans the
most sympathetic toward the United
States, confirms General Lacret's state
ment regarding the attitude of the Cu
ban army. He said to me last night:
"Even should a plebiscite of the Cu
ban people result in a majority voting
for annexation the revolutionary party
will not accept that decision, but will
still claim absolute independence. If
the United States shows a disposition
to combat that claim we can only take
to the woods again. Of course, against
the resources and power of America we
could not last a month, but we will
die fighting for that independence for
which we have so long struggled.
"Personally I believe that annexa
tion would be the best solution of the
problem, and also that annexation will
after a time come, but now we shall
and must have established that Cuban
republic so long the object of our
dreams."
General Portuondo told me that while
not giving the statement as authorita
tive he believes that a full understand
ing has been arrived at between the
American Government and Cuban lead
ers. The United States is to retain
troops in the island, maintaining a pro
tectorate, with power of veto on laws
passed by Cuban representatives. The
Cuban Government will be organized
nominally independent, but under con
trol of the United States.
Portuondo frankly stated that while
such was the probable course of events
any intervention by the United States
hi Cuban affairs or any attempt to, con
trol the Government would be bitterly
resented by the Cubans and would
probably lead to a denial of authority,
Cuban troops taking up arms. He said
that the feeling was strong In this mat
ter and the soldiers were prepared to
sacrifice everything rather than have
the taunt cast in their face that they
got rid of the flag of Spain only to
subject themselves to the yoke of the
United States.

SAMPSON SCORES
SHIFTER IN HIS
LATEST REPORT
Declares That the General Wanted
the Navy to Do the Most
Dangerous WorK.
Later, When tbe FÂ«rÂ« of tr;e Fleet Caused the
SurreQder of Santiago, Shafter Claimed
All tbe Credit.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 30.-The Navy
Department to-day made public a re
port from Admiral Sampson, covering
the operations of the United States
blockading fleet off Santiago. He says
that the bombardment of Santiago on
July 2 served no particular end, because
Shatter's attack had been postponed.
He quotes dispatches from himself to
Shafter stating that it Is impossible to
force an entrance to the harbor until
the mines had been removed and that
work could be accomplished only after
the troops had taken the forts. Shafter
replied that he could not tell when he
could take the batteries. If they were
as difficult as those against which he
was pitted, it would take some time and
a great loss of life. Said Shafter:
I am at a loss to see why the navy I
cannot work under a destructive firs a* ,
well as the aimy. My loss yesterday was I
over 500 men. By all means keep up lire j
on heights until demolished. 1 expti.i,
however, with time and sufficient men,
to capture the forts along the bay.
An hour later on the same day, July j
2. Shafter again appealed to Sampson
to immediately force the harbor en
trance so as to avoid future loss among
his men. already very heavy. He says:
"You can operate with less loss than
I can."
In reply on the same day Admiral
Sampson pointed out that the channel
of the harbor was well strewn with
mines, which would certainly result in
the sinking of one or more of his ships
if he attempted to enter the harbor
and that by sinking them the harbor
would be blocked against the entrance
of the others. He had hoped that bhaf
ter would take the batteries from the
rear, so that he might drag for the tor
pedoes, but it was Shafter"s earnest de
sire that he should force the entrance.
He would prepare to undertake it, think
ing, however, that the position of both
army and navy would be made more
difficult if they failed in the attempt.
He promised to use mines at Guantan
amo and to countermine those at Santi
ago which would consume considerable
time. Said Sampson: "It is not so
much the loss of men as the loss of
Bhips which has until now deterred
me from making a direct attack upon
the ships within the port."
Admiral Sampson says that after the
destruction of Admiral Cervera's fleet
Shafter renewed the request that he
should force the entrance to the. har
bor, and it was arranged between 'them
that the outside forts should be taken
by marines and Cubans after the fleet
had shelled them. Then the harbor was
to be forced by the fleet. Admiral Samp
son says he does not know; why this
plan was abandoned and still believes
time and many lives might have been
saved had it been carried out. Samp
son continues:
1 have been surprised to see published
in the papers any statement of refus.'l
on my part to endeavor to force ir.y way
into the harbor and cannot understand â
In case the newspaper reports be a ;ruth
ful statement of what was sent by linnâ
General Shafter sending any report of this I
kind. I here, moreover, would animad
vert upon the apparently extraordinary
openness with which every detail of hopo,
effort or sugÃestion on the part- of the
army has been published. The unwisdom .
of such procedure is too manifest for dis
cussion. The navy has been placed in
such an invidious and false position be
fore the country through the very unwise
publication of General Shafter's tele
grams that I think this matter should In
f-ome way be .made clear to the public.
On July 14 Admiral Sampson sent the
following to Secretary Long:
July 14, IS9Bâ Published telegrams of
General Shafter. Herald of July 6, reflect
on the navy. I wish the department and
tre President to understand that the first
requisite to opening harbor of Santiago '
de Cuba ts the occupation of forts and |
int.' -nchrjients at its entrance, guarding
mine fields, and that the general has
never made a move to do this, although
before his army landed he stated that
Fuch was the primary object of his op
erations. If the general Chooses to ignore
the sea approaches and to attack Santi
ago to the east and north that is his af
fair, but it should be clearly understood
that this attack does not influence the
situation at the harbor entrance, from
which his left flank is distant not less
than four miles. 1 have been ready at
any time during the last three weeks to
nilenee works, to clear entrance of mines
and to enter harbor whenever the army
will do the part which the proper conduct
of war assigns to it. To throw my ships
to certain destruction upon the mine fields
would be suicidal folly, and I have not the
force to form landing party strong enough
to- insure the capture of the forts. No
disagreements mentioned by the paper
have been brought to my notice by Gen
eral Shafter.
Admiral Sampson gives a number of
dispatches saying he was asked to
participate in the terms of surrender
and tried to find out when he would
Fend a representative; but owing to one
or two delays no time was fixed. Samp
son comments aa follows:
The foregoing showa clearly the most
absolute Joint action, an*" 1 took it for
granted that we should be joint signa
tories of any capitulations, as is custom
ary in all nervicM in such circumstances.
Captain Chadwlck arrived at the front at
the earliest hour possible for him to do Â«o
and informed General Shafter of my ex
pectancy in the matter: but General
Shafter peremptorily refused. The con
vention had already been signed 1 , and he
stated as one reason,' that nothing had
been said of the army in my report of the
fleet action of July 3. There would have
been an much reason for mentioning the
navy In the report of the land action of
July 1, when assault was .made by our
army on the Spanish lines. No mention
was made of the shipping on the capitula
tions, and Captain -Chadwick informed
General Shafter that all Spanish ships
would bÂ« regarded by us as property to be
COLLAPSE OF CENTRAL
AMERICAN COALITION
MANAGUA, Nicaragua (via Galveston), Nov. 80.â The attempt
to effect a coalition between the States of Nicaragua, Honduras and
Salvador, to be conducted under a common administration, and known
as til" United States of Central America, has failed completely.
The Federal organiser* to-day formally declared the union dis
solved, the three States resuming respectively absolute sovereignty.
The collapse is due to the failure of the troops of Honduras, acting
in behalf of the Federal organizer*, to suppress the outbreak in Sal
vador against the proposed federation and to force Salvador into the
Onion. The prospects are peaceful.

! would refer such matters to the Secretary I
of War, but that, of course, had no bear-
I Ing upon. what I considered my duty in !
i the matter, particularly in view of our >
< late experience of Spanish perfidy in re- I
gard to the injury of ships, which, in my I
i opinion, made it necessary to look after !
; their safety at once. I thus, after the
i hauling down of the Spanish flag, sent
; prize crews on board the gunboat Alva
i raao and to the five merchant steamers in
! the harbor. An officer of the army was
; found on board the Alvarado, who stated
he had been sent ,to take charge of her,
whereupon I addressed the following let-
I ter to General Shatter:

FIFTY VESSELS LOST
ALONG LONG ISLAND!
NEW YORK. Nov. 30.-The storm of
Saturday night and Sunday has liter
ally strewn the Long Island coast with
wreckage. Altogether about fifty ves
sels, not counting small yachts and
scows, were wrecked or rendered use
less, and the numerous harbors where
vessels sought shelter from the fury of
the storm are filled with wreckage nf
all kinds.
The damage in Green Point harbor
and vicinity was estimated to be over
$25,000. The small steamer Niantic Is
reported ashore near Montauk.
It was reported to-day that there is
a three-masted schooner ashore near
Wading River, fourteen miles east of
Port Jefferson. It is impossible to
learn anything about her, as communi

No word has yet been received from
the steamship Pentagoet of the Man

port on Thursday last for Bantror
where she was due early Monday. The
secretary of the company said to-day
that there was a possibility that the
ship had been taken out to sea when
the storm of Saturday night was en
countered and that she would turn up

AGUINALDO'S PRICE
TO RELEASE FRIARS

stated that Aguinaldo, the insurgent leader, demands
$1,500,000 for the release of the imprisoned friars.
was a barber by trade, but recently
has been a tin horn gamtfler. In Au
gust my husband and a man named
Nunan left Perris, where we were liv
ing, with two mules and a buckboard
and thirty days' provisions, but no
money. Before Beam left Perris he
came to see the children, I having re
fused to live with him some time pre
viously. He told them he wouldn't
come home until Christmas, when he
would bring them many presents. Some
one in the room remarked that money
was scarce. Beam replied that there
was plenty of money in the "world and
he intended to have his share by fair
means or foul. This was the last I saw
of him.
"A few days after the holdup my at
tention was called to the description of
the dead robber in the papers. Several
others said it was a good description of
Beam, so I wrote to Sheriff Holcomb
for a photograph. On receiving it I
could not swear it was that of my hus
band because the deceased wore a full
beard. I wrote again to the Sheriff,
describing several marks on my hus
band's body, particularly a lump on the
left knee. All these marks were found
on the dead man, and when I received
a picture of the deceased with clean
shaven face I recognized it immedi
ately. After a personal examination of
the body to-day 1 am positive he is the
man.
"I never thought my husband had
nerve enough to rob a train, but he was
a gambler and beat me pretty often. I
know the pistols found on him are not
the ones he left Perris with, as I re
member one of them particularly, Beam
having used it over my head."
Deputy County Clerk William Miller
knew Beam at one time, and although
he could not positively Identify the
dead outlaw he believes Beam Is the
man. In order to make identification
certain, James Hancock of Perris, a
brother of John Hancock, who has con
fessed the murder of .two men in Ne
vada, has been summoned, but hasÂ»not
yet arrived. The fact that Beam left
Perris intent on robbery with a man
named Nunan makes it seem possible
that Nunan may be the accomplice who
disappeared. Officers now have a good
clew and intend to work upon it dili
gently. â

' The California Representative Thor
oughly Qualified to Guide the
Destinies of the Navy
Department.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Nov. 30.â A Washington
special to the Evening Journal says:
Secretary John b. Long of the Navy
and Secretary Cornelius N. Bliss of the
Interior have expressed a desire to re
tire from official life as soon as they
can do so without causing embarrass
ment to the President.
They are said to be thoroughly in ac-
cord with the President's policy and
have been throughout the war and the
negotiations leading up to peace, but
each has large private interests, and
neither is apparently ambitious for
higher political honftrs. Should the
resignations be accepted Whltelaw
Reid will undoubtedly succeed Mr
Bliss, while Representative Hilborn of
California will assume the naval port
folio.
Mr. Hilborn is particularly fitted for
the position, having made the needs of
the navy the study of his lifetime Be
cause California so stanchly supported
the administration at the recent elec
tion and made such great gains It is
believed the President should recognize
it by giving it a representative in the
Cabinet in the event of a vacancy.
Expansion and construction of the
Nicaragua canal mean more to the Pa
cific States than to any other section
say Californians who are here, and
they should be represented at the coun
cil board of the President.
While the rumored changes in the
Cabinet seem purely speculative as yet
the gossip seems to have high authority
for its origin.

WILL WAGE WAR ON
EXPRESS COMPANIES
ST. LOUIS, Nov. 30.â William R. Corwine of the Merchants'
Association of New York, who is In the city attending the Mer
chants' Anti-Scalping Conference, in an Interview tells of the crusade
in New York to compel the express companies to pay the war stamp
tax imposed by the present revenue laws.
"In addition to the taking of the question into the courts," Mr.
Corwine said, "the association proposes to introduce a bill in the
Legislature this winterâ and to fight it to a finishâ to place the ex
press companies under the control of the Railroad Commission of
New York State and to regulate their charges. This fight will be a
very bitter one. The Merchants' Association proposes to obtain the co
operation of every manufacturer and every merchant in the State of
New York, and. through them, to appeal to the members of the Sen
ate and Assembly through their respective districts to support this
movement."
Efforts are being made to organize similar movements in other
States. Mr. Corwine says that a project is being pushed rapidly by the
organization, in the large cities of the country, to have package com
panies, so called, virtually take the place of the express companies.
This is being done, he says, not for the purpose of making money, but
to save It for merchants and others all over the country who are pay
ing excessive express charges. It is the purpose of these package
companies to accept packages for shipment. These will be packed in
large cases and sent to their destination by fast freight at about the
same time made by express companies and at about half the cost.
SPAIN NOW
THREATENED
BY CARLISM
Sagasta Admits the
Danger.
AUTHORITIES ARE ALARMED
PLANS FOB THE UPBISING
ELABOBATELY DEVISED.
The Pope Interested and Would
Avoid Civil War by the Mar
riage of the Pretender's Son
to Princess Mary.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Dec. I.â The Biarritz cor
respondent of the Dally Mall says:
Senor Sagasta, who has hitherto been
Bkeptlcal on the point, now admits that
Carlism is the greatest existing danger
In Spain. The authorities are seriously
alarmed at the indication of an Immi
nent rising. The Carlist plans have
been elaborately devised, even to the
extent of appointing a Governor of
Madrid.
The Madrid correspondent of the
Daily Mail says: Lieutenant General
Correo, Minister of War, declares that
the Government has 140,000 troops in
readiness to take the field in the event
of a Carlist rising and will soon have
200,000 available. He says, however,
that he does not believe the Carlists in
tend to move.
Four hundred guns, which were
smuggled, have been seized in a Basque
village. Don Carlos, in his forthcom
ing manifesto, will make a strong ap
peal to the army. The Carlists agree
among themselves as to the ability of
an immediate movement. The military
element is impatient, but the civilians
urge the uselessness of an attempt to
rise until the Carlists are assured of
the help of the army.
The Rome correspondent of the Dally
Mail says: The Pope has been so much
impressed by the alarm expressed by
the papal nuncio at Madrid at the pos
sibility of civil war that, with the con
sent of the Queen Regent, and with a
view of avoiding bloodshed, he has
opened negotiations with Don Carlos,
proposing that Don Jaime, the pre
tender's son, should marry Princess
Mary of Asturias.
GENERAL BLANCO
SAILS FROM HAVANA
And It Is Piobable That His Victory-
Creating Typewriter Goes
With Him.
HAVANA, Nov. 30.-The Spanish mail
steamer Villa Verde, with Marshal Blan
co, the former Captain General of Cuba,
and his suite on board, left this port at 1
a, m. to-day.
The departure of Marshal Blanco was
not accompanied by the pomp and cere
mony marking similar events in previous
years. On returning from paying a fare
well visit to his life-long friend. Count
Lamblllo, at 11 o'clock last night, the for
mer Captain General found assembled at
the palace Generals Castellanos, Pa'rrado,
Ruiz, Ruberter and Maroto, the civil Gov
ernor, and other military and civil of
ficials.
After a long conference with his suc
cessor. General Castellanos, Marshal
Blanco left the palace, accompanied by
the generals mentioned, and drove to the
Cabelleria wharf, where he was met by-
Admiral Manterola, the Spanish naval
commander here, who placed the ad
miralty launch at his disposal. The adr
miral accompanied the marshal on board
the Villa Verde. An affectionate farewell
took place on the wharf between Marshal
Blanco and a number of his old friends,

DELAY IN WORK ON THE
POSTOFFICE BUILDING
Declared to Be Due to the Changing of Plans
by Federal Judges After Steel Contracts
Were Made.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 30.â 1n answer to Congressman Loud's
complaint that work on the San Francisco new Postoffice building is
practically at a standstill, when, in fact, the steel work was contract
ed to be completed by March 1, Chief Executive Officer Kemper said to
The Call correspondent to-night that the delay was due to the fact
that Federal Judges resident in San Francisco had suggested various
changes in the building since the foundation was laid and the steel
contract let. These suggestions were adopted by the supervising
architect in order to satisfy the court officials, thereby necessitating
a change in the steel structure and steel material. He says the de
partment is not to blame, neither is Contractor Thomas Marshall Â©f
â ttsburg. Chief Kemper is advised that 480,000 pounds of steel was
shipped by Carnegie & Co. of Pittsburg on November 17 last, and
that by the time it reaches San Francisco the derricks and cranes
will have been placed in position ready to begin work on the super
structure.

Special Dispatch to The Call. Â
SAN JOSE, Nov. 30.â Deep mystery
surrounds the death of Bessie M. Bai
ley, a former â¢ inmate of Agnews Asy
lum, who was â¢ found â¢ dead 'â¢ in ; a car !
berth near Elko, Nev.,, on November 18. i
The young lady was on her way to
Lafayette, Ind., where her uncle, M. : j
Timmins, was, to care for her. Whether
her death resulted from murder, suicide
or natural causes will never be known, - j
because an . over-zealous undertaker j
filled the body with embalming fluid j
before a post-mortem could be held.. â 
There are all kinds of rumors afloat j
about i the^_- girl's . death, and some of
them are of 'a. sensational character.
The greatest,: secrecy has surrounded
the case, and a . although , nearly two
weeks has elapsed it was only to-day
that news of the" death leaked out. \ The i
asylum officials are , worrying over the j
matter and at the next meeting of the
board it will be investigated. â¢ , -
If Miss Bailey spent the night at j
Sacramento, as rumor has it, then the j
mystery is deeper than ever and there j
may be a man in the case. No reason j
can be advanced for â  her ; death. ; Coro- i
ncr Morgan of Elko says : that in his
"private opinion" death resulted from
poisoning. It is not thought she would
commit suicide and there was no ap
parent cause why she should be gotten

purchased it along â :- the road or was

sent to Lafayette, Ind. The matter
was brought before the trustees ana
they decided to send her. The sum
of. $52 -was appropriated for railway
fare. The patient had also $30 of her
own. The girl had been improving rap
idly for the past year and all the phy
sicians pronounced her well enough to
travel alone. Amourist ticket over the
Union Pacific was purchased and the
excursion manager agreed to watch out
for her.
On November 16 Bessie Bailey was
ordered discharged from the asylum
and the next morning she started East.
She was In the best of health and joy
ous at the prospect of going to â¢ her
relatives. She was driven to Milpitas
to catch the 6 o'clock train for Oak
land, where connection was made with
the through Eastern train.
Here the mystery commences. There
is some doubt as to when she died. The
Information varies. One story is that
she went straight through on the train
and was found dead at Elko, while an
other rumor has it that she stopped
over night at Sacramento.
The asylum authorities say the girl
was in perfect health, save a slight
cold. She had no poison, and it is not
thought she would kill herself. It is
not known what disposition was made
of the remains, but it is supposed they
were buried in the potter's field.
Bessie Bailey has had more than her
share of notoriety since she became an
inmate of Agnews. Last summer she
' figured prominently in the scandal at
that institution. On the morning of
June 12, Eddie Herbert, an attendant,
was caught in shirt sleeves and stock-
Ing feet in the corridor in front of
Bessie Bailey's room. Herbert was told
to report to Dr. Sponogle, but instead
of doing so he mounted his wheel and
rode away. Inquiry developed the fact
that he had a key to the door of the
corridor and she a key opening the door
into the corridor. They met clandes
tinely and spent much time in one an
other's company.
Bessie M. Bailey \**as committed to
the asylum on June 29, 1896, from Santa
Cruz. She was 18 years of age. and", as
i the record states, homeless and friend
| less. Hysteria was the cause, and she
j was despondent. Mrs. Oliver, a sister,
| also is an inmate of Agnews.
Chairman Curnow of the Board of
i Managers said this evening:
"Mystery certainly surrounds Bessie
Bailey's death, and I would like to see
it cleared. I do not believe she com
mitted suicide, or she would have left
some trace. There is no reason I know
of why she should be made awtey with,
yet I cannot believe death resulted
from natural causes."
It was rumored that an attache of the
asylum had paid particular attention to
Miss Bailey, given her chicken dinners
and spent a great deal of time In her
company: also that the Board of Trus
tees had discussed the affair at the last
meeting. The person accused was in
terviewed to-night and denied these
statements. He said they were made to
Injure him, and he knew the originator
of the slander.
Yorktown Ready for Service.
VALLEJO, Nov. 30.â The United States
gunboat Yorktown has undergone a thor
ough overhauling at Mare Island navy
yard. It is now in flrst-class condition
and could be ready for sea at a few days'
notice.COLONEL DAN BURNS
STATES HIS POSITION
Says His Acceptance of the Senatorial Toga
Is Simply a Matter of "Personal
; Inclination."
The Good People of the State Hold Their Breath While He
Toys With the Honor That Is His for
the Asking.
The people of the great State of Cali
fornia are now engaged in the pleasing
occupation of holding their breath
while Colonel Dan Burns,
of State, present political boss and re
puted Mexican mine-owner, makes up
his mind whether or not he wishes to
be United States Senator.
With the thoughtlessness and lack of
attention to details that resulted In a
loss to the State of over $30,000 during
the time he served It as Secretary of
State, the colonel does not concern him
self as to whether the people want him
for th^ir next United States Senator,
his present hesitancy, according to his
own account, being due entirely to the
fact that he has not yet made up his
own mind as to whether or not he
wants the place. Pending his final de
cteion, he says that he is not a can
didate for the honor, a statement which
he qualifies sufficiently to leave him
free to act if. he sees fit to change his
mind.
The facts just stated are drawn from
an interview had yesterday with Col
onel Burns on the subject of his Sen
atorial aspirations. When viewed from
the standpoint of the ordinary citizen
the factSjseem to be that the colonel is
just now busily engaged in feeling the
public's pulse while he attempts to slip
up on the blind side of the Senatorial
He is a candidate in the same
sense that a chicken thief is a cora
miseiOD merchant.
A few weeks ago Colonel Burns was
Interviewed by a representative of' this
paper on the subject of M. H. de
Young's supposed Senatorial aspira
tions. What 'he said on that occasion
was faithfully reported, but the truth
ful politician saw fit to deny it on the
following day, his defense being that
he had not made the statements at
tributed to him; that he did not know
that he was being interviewed for pub
lication, and that if he had known they
were to be printed he would never have
made the statements, anyway. Profit
ing by past experience, the interviewer
yesterday infor.med the statesman that
the impending talk was to be for publi
cation. This being understood, the fol
lowing conversation ensued
"Are you a candidate for United
StateV Senator?
"I am riot a candidate."
"Have you decided that you will not
be a candidate?"
"On that point I have not yet made
up my mind. I have not yet decided
what course I shall pursue."
"Under what conditions would " you'
become a candidate?"
"I have not considered conditions."
"Have you been urged to enter the
contest for the Senatorshlp?"
"Many of my friends have earnestly
solicited me to announce myself as a
candidate. I have received letters and
messages from all parts of the State
urging me to become a candidate. It is.
a question now of personal inclination.
I have no desire for service In Con
gress. If one thing more than another
would influence me to enter the contest
It would be such articles as appeared

CLOSE CALL FOR THE HAYDN BROWN
The British ships Afon Alaw and Scottish Hills and the American ship Shenandoah and bark Haydn
Brown were all off the heads and sailing in at 10 a. m. yesterday. The bark outran them all and crossed the
bar and drifted and sailed through the Golden Gate alone. After passing between the heads the wind died out
and the Haydn Brown drifted down on Point Diablo. Luckily the tug Rescue went to her assistance and got
a line aboard before she struck and towed her to a safe anchorage off Black Point.
|In two newspapers to-day. If I did not
i understand the ways of the world I
might believe half of the flattering
offers of support which I have re
! ceived, and, believing them, become in
j Mated with the thought that 1 am the
| greatest man In California; but I do
not lose my balance so easily. I listen
and reflect before I decide on a plan
of action."
"Is It proper to ask, cc-lonel, if Mr.
I Herrin of the Southern Pacific Com-
I pany desires you to become a candi
date?"
"That is a question that you should
| propound to Mr. Herrin. Others have
j sought to get Mr. Herrin to join them
In bringing cut a candidate for United
States Senator. They would have no
right to blame me if 1 sought Mr. Her
rin's support, or if he gave me his sup
port unsolicited."
Such was the interview, and it is
given here for what it is worth. Know
ing that he was being interviewed for
publication it is to be presumed that
Colonel Burns desires the public to un
derstand that it rests entirely with
himself as to whether he will represent
the people of the State in Congress. As
it is with him "now simply a matter of
personal inclination" other prospective
candidates for the honor^may retire
from the contest until the colonel
makes up his mind. Of course the peo
ple have nothing to say and the mem
bers of the Legislature are not material
factors in question. It all depends
upon the colonel's mood.
The Joke seems to be on the half a
score or more of Senatorial candidates
who have been "making their fights"
for months past, and on all of the
newspapers of the State that have been
worrying their editorial brains in an
endeavor to point out the course that
should be pursued by the Republican
majority in the Legislature in the mat
ter of electing a United States Senator.
While they have been appealing to pop
ular prejudices Colonel Dan has
been wearing the Senatorial tea for a
nightshirt. It now develops that he
will use it for every day wear if it
suits his "personal inclination" to
do so.
If what Colonel Burns has to say
for himself is left out of the question,
it seems barely possible that there is
yet some small hope for some of tho
gentlemen who are willing and able to
represent this great State in the Senate
of the United States. Honest men will
not believe that Colonel Burns owns a
majority of the men who have been '
elected to the Legislature. It is the
general belief that had Colonel Burns
had the courage to announce his can
didacy prior to the election the people
would have demanded from legislative
candidates a pledge that under no cir
cumstances should they vote for him
for United States Senator. Failure to
subscribe to such a pledge would have
meant the inevitable defeat of the can
didate. But Colonel Burns is a politi
cal hunter of ability and experience,
and he prefers to stalk his game in the
manner In which a South Carolina
darkey stalks a farmer's chicken. Tn
'this case the farmer is represented by
the people of California, and it remains
to be seen, now that the thief is dis
covered in the act of robbing the roost,
what part the shotgun of public opinion
will play in the game.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 1, 189 S.
THROUGH ICE
AND SNOW AND
FULLING STARS
Hard Luck Voyages of
Four Big Vessels.
HAYDN BROWN'S CLOSE CALL
VERY NEARLY WENT ASHORE
ON POINT DIABLO.
Shenandoah Just Escaped a Meteor.
Afon Alaw in the Iee â Scottish
Hills Forced to Come
Via Good Hope.
Four deep-water vessels reached port
yesterday with tales of many perils es
caped. The bark Haydn Brown made
a good run from Departure Bay only to
narrowly escape destruction on Point Di
ablo. The Scottish Hills encountered such
a succession of gales oft the Horn that
Captain Blackmore gave up the attempt
to round it and squared away for the
Cape of Good Hope. The Shenandoah had
a narrow escape from an Iceberg and was
nearly struck by a meteor, while the Afon
Alaw had a time that Captain Thomas Is
not likely to forget in a hurry.
The British ship Eton Hall left Swan
sea two flays before the Afon Alaw and
on September 2 she had to put into Rio
de Janeiro with her decks badly damaged
and her boats gone. The Routenburn
left Swansea four days after the Afon
Alaw and on September 2 she also put
into Rio de Janeiro with her cargo shift
ed and some damage to the ship.
In talking about the voyage of the Afon
Alaw Captain Thomas said: "We had bad
weather from the start. Off the River
Platte we had two strong gales with a
very high cross-sea. The wind in one of
them shifted suddenly from southwest to
southeast without any warning or moder
ation of the gale. This put the ship
broadside on, and it being very dark it
was impossible to wear the ship around
until daylight. In the meantime a heavy
sea struck her and threw the cargo over
to leeward, giving the ship a very heavy
list to port, although shifting-boards were
fixed the same as for a wheat cargo. The
next morning the weather moderated, the
ship was wore and put on the port tack.
| Part of this day and the next day the
i crew was employed in trimming the
I cargo."
The captain's log continues as follows:
On approaching the cape the wind was strong
from west-southwest, so we kept to the south
ward. In latitude 69 south wind fresh from
east, with blinding 1 snow, when the lookout
man reported Icebergs on port bow. Hauled
the ship up on starboard tack, with her head
about north. When it cleared up we found the
icebergs reported were small Ice floes, but Im
mediately after we found we were almost hem
med in by pack Ice. Got canvas reduced as
soon as possible to three lower topsails and
foresails. From the topgallant yard pack or
field ice was reported all around ac far as
could be seen from the northwest by southwest
to southeast. There were several small fleldÃ,
which we passed through, none of these being
solid enough to damage the ship.
At midnight a fearful blizzard came down
of wind, enow and sleet. 'Got the foresail
hauled up, but could but partly furl It, a> it
was all frozen stiff, and gome of the crew got
frostbitten. At daylight some large icebergs
were sighted on our lee how, on which we
were drifting. To make sail on the ship vu
impossible, as all the ropes and blocks were
frozen up so that in some cases the ropes and
blocks seemed to be all one. The brace bump
kins, blocks and braces looked as one. All the
main rail belaying pins and ropes were one
solid mass of ice. Decks had a cover of Ice,
which in some place* was over a foot thick.
The Ice on deck had forced out the ports on
each side, so Instead of ports a large lump of
ice filled the space and stood out of the side a
couple of feet. By the use of capstan' bars and
other things we were able to clear away three
staysails and set them, and by that means grit
a little headway on her and passed to the
windward of the largest berg, which was
about 300 feet high and a mile from end to
end. We kept drifting all night through the
only passage visible, as the. pack Ice was to the
west ami south and Icebergs to the northeast
and north. Next day the wind came from the
northward and the Ice commenced to thaw.
Mauls, handspikes and crowbars were used to
cii up the ice on deck.
In conclusion Captain Thomas said that
in all his experience of twenty-four pas
sages to the westward around Cape Horn
he had never before met pack ice, nor
had he ever before seen the blocks, rails
and ropes frozen so as to be unfit for
use.
The Shenandoah from Baltimore had a
similar experience to the Afon Alow off
Cape Horn. Her most exciting experi
ence was with a meteor, however. "I
never saw such a meteor before," said
Captain Starkey yesterday, "and at one
time it looked as though it was going to
strike the Shenandoah. It came sailing
through the heavens, a great big green
ball with a long trail of iire behind it.
Had it struck the phip it would have been
all day with us and another vessel would
have been 'pouted at Lloyds as missing.'
It sailed over our head, however, and
exploded before striking the water some
distance away. We saw the fragments
as they scattered, but we did not hear
any sound.
"It was a most beautiful and yet a fear
some sight. The light from the meteor
seemed to light up the ship with Its green
glare, and as it came nearer and nearer
It increased in size until it looked to oui
scared eyes the size of a house. "We all
expected to hear a great noise when it
went off, but we were disappointed. The
scattering fragments struck the water
with a hissing noise, so if there had been
any explosion when the meteor burst I
think we would have heard it."
The Scottish Hills was 188 days coming
from Hamburg and 10 per cent reinsur
ance was paid on her. From latitude 42
south, longitude 49 east, to latitude 4S
south, longitude 160 east, the ship en
countered nothing but contrary gales, ac
companied by terrific squalls which blew
with urricane force. These were accom
panied by mountainous cross seas, and as
no headway could be made Captain
Blackmore gave up the attempt at round
ing the Horn and came here via the Cape
of Good Hope.
The Haydn Brown came very near go
ing ashore on her first trip to San Fran
cisco. She was purchased last month by
Captain Charles Nelson, and was coming
here from Departure Bay with a load
of coal. The Brown, Afon Alaw, Shen
andoah and Scottish Hills were all sail
ing in, but the bark was the fastest ves
sel and ran away from the others. After
crossing the bar the wind fell light and
she drifted and sailed in past the heads.
Then the wind died away altogether and
the current began to set the Haydn
Brown on Point Diablo. When she was
close inshore the tug Rescue, bound out,
hove in sight, and immediately went to
the assistance of the bark. There was
no haggling about a price, and the tug
was soon made fast and towed the bark,
stern first, into safety.
Robert Boyd is foreman of the swee,ors
employed by the Harbor Commissioners
on the water front and Lee Jasqua drives
one of the dirt wagons. Boyd and Jasqua
are not good friends and they have had
many a spat, with Boyd generally first
best." Jasqua was determined to get even
and so as not to jeopardize his position
got two days' leave of absence from Chief
Wharfinger Scott on the understanding
that his brother was to do his work.
Tuesday Jasqua hunted up Boyd and
they agreed to meet that night in a place
on the corner of Eighth and Harrison
and settle the matter with bare knuckles.
Each Tvas to bring two friends and no
more to see fair play. Jasqua took along
his brother and a sailor named O'Brien,
but for fear of foul play had six brawny
longshoremen stationed in a nearby sa
loon. Jasqua and his seconds were on
time and a few minutes later Boyd, ac
companied by seven or eight roughs,
marched on the scene armed with clubs.
They proceeded to lay out Jasqua and his
friends, but the 'ongshoremen heard the
racket and rushing in turned the tables.
Boyd's friends were chased out of the
place, but Boyd was caught, and yester
day his best friends didn't recognize him.
He got a terrible beating. During the
melee one of Boyd's henchmen tore out
Sailor O'Brien's eye, and now there is a
"John Doe" warrant out for the man who
did it.
The sloop yacht Florence A is now sup
posed to be in Mexican waters, and James
L. Athey, her owner, is mourning her
loss. Some months ago Athey rented the
sloop to E. E. Hicks, a graduate of the
medical department, of the University of
California, for a trip to Santa Barbara.
Instead of going there Hicks went to
Mazatlan, and Athey has not heard of
him or the yacht since. Hicks is sup
posed to be practicing medicine in Mexico.

HOW THOSE
DEPOT PLANS
WERE CHANGED
The Commissioners
Were Responsible.
COLNON'S LITTLE SPEECH
ARCHITECT E. R. SWAIN PRE
SENTS HIS SIDE.
Commissioner Colnon, Speaking to a
Question of Privilege, Asserts
That He Did Not Take
the Initiative.
Edward R. Swain, supervising architect
of the ferry building, was the chief wit
ness yesterday at the session of the Sen
ate Committee of Inquiry. Before ad-^
journment Tuesday evening last General
Dickinson, chairman of the committee,
gave notice that the line of inquiry would
be formed to establish the responsibility
for changes in the plans and specifica
tions. It was understood also that Mr.
Swain would have ample opportunity to
present figures and records of measure
ment to dispute the calculations embodied
In the report of Expert James W. Reid.
A vast deal of time was occupied in the
expression of opinion concerning a proper
allowance for work done and material
furnished under the revised specifications.
Mr. Swain Submitted figures showing thÂ«
cost of new material in excess of th*
amounts figured by Mr. Reid. It was
obvious that the forms of calculations or
the methods of determining cost were not
uniform. Mr. Swain followed one form and
Mr. Reid another. Hence a great deal
of figuring was done during the progress
of the inquiry in order to bring the cal
culations to a common basis.
On the total cost there was not a wide
divergence. On marble cornice it was
contended by Mr. Swain that Mr. Reid's
report did not give an estimate approxi
mating the actual cost of the material.
On the four big contracts, steel and iron,
masonry, carpenter work, and roofing
painting and glazing, it was shown that
the revision of the specifications was au
thorized by the Board of Harbor Commis
sioners. The architect's estimates of In
creased allowance by reason of the
changes were separately approved by the
Board of Commissioners. A statement
setting forth in general terms such ap
proval was embodied in the official re
porter's notes and made part of the of-
Jlclal record of the Investigation.
General Dickinson, chairman of
the committee, directed that the state
ment be embodied in the- committee's
record of the Inquiry, Commissioner Col
non addressed the chairman, saying, in
substance: "Is this general statement,
or omnibus report of the action of the
Board of Harbor Commissioners, to be
transmitted to the Legislature in lieu of
the record on each change, as contained
in the minutes of the board? As a mat
ter of personal privilege I desire to re
quest that the minutes of the board be
entered in the report to show how each
Commissioner voted. I have been ac
cused of taking the initiative in allowing
these changes. The record will show
that as chairman of the board I put a
motion whenever It was made, and when
two Commissioners voted In the affirma
tive declared the approval of the board.
The only purpose I have is to show that
the imputation sought to be cast on me
by the press Is unjust."
General Dickinsonâ Suppose that all
three Commissioners were present, and
that Chadbourne made the motion, that
Cole seconded it, and that you made no
objection; would you not be responsible
with the others for the action of the
board?
Commissioner Colnonâ Yes; I would be
responsible morally and legally, and I do
not seek to shirk that responsibility. The
board acted harmoniously on this revis
ion, but I have been charged with as
suming the Initiative on all these
changes.
General Dickinsonâ There is no at
tempt to besmirch you.
Commissioner Colnonâ l want the offi
cial record to prove the falsity of the
charge that I assumed the initiative.
General Dickinsonâ [ shall determine
that all three Commissioners assented,
when no protest was entered.
The change in flooring from terra cotta
and cement to expanded metal and ce
ment was a subject of prolonged contro
versy. Architect Swain contended that
Expert Reid's estimate of $9000 was ex
cessive.
The estimate of Mr. Wright, the ex
pert of the Grand Jury, was not brought
out in the testimony yesterday, but it is
ascertained that it varies only $600 from
Mr. Reid's figures.

THE CONTUMACIOUS EXPRESS
COMPANIES.
A RUM OR comes over the wires from St. Louis
to the effect that the merchants of the Western
States'are preparing a petition asking Congress
to place the express companies of the county in the
hands of the Interstate Commerce Commission. It
is to be hoped that this is true. Moreover, it is to be
hoped that when Congress receives the petition it will
instantly pass an act ordering the commission to take
the express companies in hand. If there ever was a
class of corporations which needed a strong dose of
retributive justice it is the express companies.
These corporations have thus far resisted all at
tempts on the part of people and Government to
make them pay their war taxes. They have, in viola
tion of the decisions of the courts and the rulings of
Attorney General?. Internal Revenue agents and
others, flagrantly refused to comply with the statute.
Not only have they displayed a selfish and unpatriotic
spirit, entirely at variance with the course of other
corporations during the late war, but they have been
arrogant and insolent as well. They have forced the
payment of their war taxes upon the people with a
reckless disregard of the decencies which demands
punishment of some kind.
Under the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce
Commission these corporations could be made to re
spect the Government and meet some of their public
obligations. The commission would have power to
regulate their rates, prevent their discriminations and
compel them to obey the laws. Heretofore they have
had things mostly their own way. This may account
in part for their defiant attitude upon the war tax
question. A specimen of the way in which they do
business is found in the course of Wells, Fargo &
Co., the local express corporation guilty of violating
the war revenue law. This company stamps the
packages of its large customers and pays for the
newspaper bundles. It cinches only the helpless por
tion of the public.
We sincerely hope the merchants of the Western
States will persist in forcing this matter upon the at
tention of Congress. If sufficient pressure is brought
to bear doubtless- that body will enact the necessary
laws to put the express companies upon the rack.
Certainly these corporations should not be permitted
forever to set the whole people of the United States
at defiance. We, in common with most sane in
dividuals, are disposed to regard with toleration or
dinary disputes as to the meaning of laws. But the
war revenue law is not ambiguous. Not only does it
require the express companies to pay for the stamps
used in their business, but all the Judges and officials,
except one, who have so far considered the subject
have so decided. Under the circumstances of the
case almost any measure of punishment would not be
considered too severe by the public.
THE LATE CORBETT AND SHARKEY.
THAT there should be occasion for devoting
space to such creatures as Corbett and Sharkey
is a matter for regret. The pair seem to forget
that as attractions they are dead. They persist in
projecting their unpleasant remains across the line of
vision. They even talk of "fighting" again, and the
suggestion is made that they "fight" here. Not if
decent citizens can help it. San Francisco has had
enough of them and their kind. The pugilists are
fr_uds and fakers. They have been fully exposed.
Yet the public is forgetful, and unless attention is
directed continually to the record of these fellows,
sooner or later they may again enter the ring, attract
a crowd and annex a purse.
The proposal has been made that they "fight" for
the benefit of charity. The scheme is too apparent.
Probably in the judgment of the pugs there could
be no more fitting object upon which to shower the
alms than the pugs themselves. Charity does not yet
have to rely upon a couple 01 rowdies for the means
of doing good, and when it shall have been reduced
to such extremity it will be in a bad way. These fel
lows would as soon do their robbing in the nanr of
charity as in any other, since, for the time at least,
their own names have lost power to draw. Just now
suckers are sated. There is a glr.t in the gold brick
market.
There v only one proper fashion of treating the
professional fighter. This is to regaid him as an
enemy of society, a corrupter of morals, a nuisance
and a swindler. He should be prevented from follow
ing his calling, and, as he will not work, Jn the end
the law against vagrancy would fittingly terminate
his public career.
Peru reports a revolution just out of sight, but
whether going: or coming advices fail to state.
THE PHILIPPINE PURCHASE.
IT is announced, with an appearance of fact, that
our Peace Commissioners at Paris have arranged
with Spain for the purchase of her sovereignty in
the Philippines for the sum of $20,000,000, leaving
the island debt in an unadjusted condition. This
I treaty of purchase may be separate from the treaty
which settles our controversy with Spain, or it may
Ibe a part thereof. On this point there is no informa
tion. When the history of the West and East Indian
tropical islands is considered, it is plain that Spain
has driven a very good bargain. We have many florid
statements of the fertility of the tropical islands.
Their beauty has been written and sung, and they
are imbedded in literature from Hakluyt's Voyages
tc Joaquin Miller's poems. But when we are taking
twenty millions from American taxpayers to buy land
seven thousand miles away, as a practical people it
becomes us to look beyond the poetry of the purchase
and see what it will prospectively add to our basket
and our store.
The commercial value of the West and East In-
J dian tropics lies in certain products of their soil, in
I sugar, hemp, tobacco and rice. An examination of
i the conditions under which these are produced may
j dispel some illusions which form the iridescent back
i ground of this new purchase.
Labor in the tropics has never had features in com
mon with labor in the temperate zone. Tropical pro
'â  duction of the articles of commerce has been always
forced. Labor under a vertical sun is not necessary
to the support of life. That support is furnished
1 spontaneously by nature. In the temperate zone life
I must, be supported by labor. The world's highest
civilization' is in that zone, because men have to live
by overcoming the resistance of nature. In the tropics
nature presents no resistance, but lavishes the sus
tenance of man with a prodigal hand. Therefore
tropical civilization has always been low.
The European countries which have held tropical
possessions have realized profit on them only by
! forcing labor to production. When France owned
i Hayti the exports were $50,000,000 a year, the result
â of labor driven by lash and spur. After Toussaint
; L'Ouvertnre, Hayti became independent, France was
expelled, labor ceased because the lash and spur were
withdrawn, and the exports fell to $1,500,000, and
j consist principally of the spontaneous products of the
j soil.
Jamaica was the only greatly fertile West Indian
possession of Great Britain. When production was
forced by the lash on the back of slave labor it was
an important possession, but now its exports have
fallen to $7,582,630 annually, although by reason of
the altitude of its mountains it has the best climate
found in any of the American tropics.
The same story runs round the world. When
forced labor ceases, tropical production lapses and
cemmerce decays. The great trouble with Spain was
that she held on to slave labor in the tropics long
after England and France gave it up, and after
Canovas emancipated her slaves force exerted by a
military' government continued to compel labor to its
task, until in Cuba and the Philippines it revolted.
Every day comes the story that the liberated Cu
bans refuse to work. Spanish compulsion is upon
them no more. Three-quarters of them are negroes.
j Nature produces all they want, and they will lapse
\ into exactly the same condition as their congeners,
i the descendants of .the black slaves in Hayti, San
i Domingo and Jamaica. They live where white men
j cannot, where no other labor can exist, and if there
jis no pow r er to drive them to their tasks, these will
! remain undone.
The same conditions, in a more marked degree,
prevail in the Philippines. Spain, by a combination
of military and theocratic government, laid exactions
upon the people that could be met only by forced
labor. That labor produced a total inward and out
ward commerce of only $30,000,000 a year at the
highest tide of Spanish oppression of the people by
compelling them to work. What are we going to do
in the Philippines? A vast majority of these ten mil
lions of people refuse to go again into colonial con
ditions. 1\) them those conditions mean forced labor,
and they don't want to work because they don't have
to in order to supply all their wants. Therefore it
is plain that we must make our title good by con
quest. Spain may give us a quitclaim; she cannot
give a warranty. After we conquer the islands we
cannot put labor again under the lash. White labor
there is impossible. We will have all the difficulties
and cost of a military government, and get a gold
brick in return.
Let this be remembered: No nation has ever se
cured profit out of a tropical colony except by a sys
tem of servile labor, or compulsory labor. We can
not change natural conditions, and therefore cannot
get out of the Philippines a Spanish profit without
using Spanish methods.
Without desiring in any measure to influence the
court, it may be remarked that the man who engages
in forgery and then confesses that his accomplices are
guilty does not take on the aspect of a blossom of
innocence himself.
Europe is reported to be opposed to American ex
pansion. So are many Americans; but the opposition
cf Europe will tend to weaken them. They may not
desire the Philippines, but they want Europe to attend
to its business.
A young man of San Diego has just died from the
effect of a 100-foot dive. The utility of the 100-foot
dive, the plunge from a balloon and the thrusting of
the head in a lion's mouth have never been fully
grasped.
c SIN OF OMISSION.
A CONSIDERABLE number of Congressmen
have given their views on the programme of
legislative work to be undertaken this winter.
There has been, of course, more or less divergence
in their statements, but in one notable respect they
have been alike. None among them has given any
prominence to the subject of protection to American
shipping. That issue seems to have escaped the at
tention of all who have up to this time spoken of the
prospects of the session.
It is not easy to understand why this should be so.
The importance of the subject is well understood, for
commercial expansion is now the prevailing desire of
the people and the most pressing of our industrial
needs. It occupies a large part of political discussion
among the people and the press, and is recognized as
a material factor in every problem that confronts us,
whether it be one of domestic or of foreign politics.
There can be no comprehensive commercial expan
sion without an adequate merchant marine, nor in
competition with the subsidized marine of other
powers can American ships maintain themselves on
the sea without some form of aid from the Govern
ment. To grant that aid in a liberal measure would
be economy in the fullest and truest sense of the term,
for at present we are paying to foreign ship-owners
something like $150,000,000 a year to carry our com
merce for us.
Several Congressmen is discusring the work of
the session have declared that earnest efforts will be

made to provide this winter for the construction of
the Nicaragua canal. That the people will heartily
support any well directed plan for that enterprise is
beyond question, and yet under present conditions we
would be constructing the waterway for the benefit
| of European ship-owners rather than our own. Long
before the canal is completed we should have an ex
panding merchant marine to make use of it.
By the St. Louis platform the Republican party is
emphatically pledged to foster and promote our
shipping industries. Such a policy is an essential
part of the great principle of protection of which the
party is the recognized champion. So long as our
merchant m..rine is left exposed to the ruinous com
petition of the subsidized vessels of Europe, with their
cheaper labor in the shipyards and cheaper wages for
sailors, so long will the protective legislation of the
country be incomplete and inadequate.
NEEDED PRISON REFORMS.
ri CCORDING to the report of the State Board
/ \ of Prison Directors the management and dis
* â  cipline of the prisons at Folsom and San
Quentin compare favorably with any similar institu
tion in the Union, and yet there is no classification of
prisoners which permits the separation of the totally
depraved from those who are young in vice, nor any
effective means of preventing the prisoners from ob
taining opium.
On that showing, prison reform is needed every
where in the Union. Certainly it is needed here.
The Directors report that a means of separating the
two classes of prisoners is desirable, but add: "To
carry out our views in this direction would involve
the construction of new cell buildings, the introduc
tion of new industries, and a large expenditure of
money. Probably it is a larger question from a finan
cial standpoint than the people are prepared to re
gard favorably in their present mood."
That the people are avers to any increase in the
cost of maintaining prisons is beyond question, but
possibly the desired reform might be accomplished
without the heavy expense suggested. There are gen
erally more ways than one of effecting reforms, and
an investigation of the subject by experts might re
sult in the discovery of some means by which the
separation of the juvenile and first offenders from
habitual criminals could be achieved at a cost the
people would willingly pay.
The smuggling of opium into the prisonsis oneof the
evils that to outsiders seems to imply a woeful lack of
discipline somewhere. To prevent the use of opium
in a large city may be impossible, but it ought to be
comparatively easy to prevent it in a penitentiary.
The Directors recommend the enactment of a law
making the introduction of opium into the prisons a
penal offense, and the recommendation should be
adopted. It is but a badly managed commonwealth
that cannot make its laws obeyed even in its prisons.
The most gratifying feature of the report is the
showing made of the good effects of the parole law.
The system was adopted with much hesitation, and
there was a widespread fear that it would result
badly. The Directors report that they have exercised
the authority conferred upon them by the act with
the utmost caution, but with encouraging results.
They announce that fully 80 per cent of the paroled
prisoners are leading industrious and honorable
lives.
fl FEDERAL MARRIAGE LAW.
\A R. ROBERTS of Utah, who has just been
/ \ elected to Congress as a representative of
* * Democracy, free silver, free trade and four
wives, is likely to be the cause of an agitation which
will go far beyond his personal fortunes and possibly
result in a far-reaching reform in our marriage laws.
As has been pointed out by The Call, it will be easy
for Congress to refuse a seat to Roberts on the
ground of his polygamous marriages, but a full set
tlement of the whole question at issue can hardly be
effected without the adoption of a constitutional
amendment forbidding polygamy and the enactment
of proper legislation to enforce it.
This- view of the issue has been taken by a large
number of authorities, and consequently a move
ment of considerable strength has been already
started to support the proposed amendment. It is
certain that a memorial will be laid before Congress
urging that steps be taken to submit the question to
the State Legislatures, and that the memorial will
have able advocates in both houses.
The movement does not flow solely from the op
position to polygamy, though of course all of its ad
vocates would be glad of a means of putting an end
to that evil. Much of the strength of the agitation
is due to the fact that the adoption of the amend
ment would authorize the enactment of a Federal
marriage law, and thereby enable Congress to put an
end to the confusion which now exists by reason of
the diversities of State laws on the subject.
It has long been recognized that a nation with
forty-five different divone codes is more of a para
dise for lawyers than a well organized society. The
evils resulting from the conflict of State laws on the
subject have been well known and frequently dis
cussed. The advocates of reform in this direction
will be prompt to take advantage of the chance
afforded by the Roberts case to get an amendment to
the constitution which will enable them to carry out
their plan of establishing a uniform, marriage and
divorce law throughout the Union.
The issue, it will be seen, is likely to become one
which will affect all the States, and not Utah only.
This fact, while adding to the strength of the advo
cates of the amendment, will also increase the oppo
sition to it, and the result is likely to be one of the
most interesting contests of a non-partisan nature
that the country has known for a long time.
A curious feature of the murder of a Kansan by a
son who got in a hurry to realize on the life insur
ance is that according to the law as lately interpreted
in a California court the son can obtain the money
and use it in his defense. Belew, convicted of murder
and hanged for it, had inherited the property of his
victims, and his heirs cannot be disturbed in pos
session of it.

PETER McGLADE
MADE MONEY ON
BOGUS ORDERS
Has Disappeared and Left No
Trace, Except a Shortage of
$1100 at His Broker's.
A fat salary at the City Hall and the
ponies at Ingleside, with the cock
tail route as the road between, have
wrought the undoing of another
"trusted deputy." Peter McGlade, chief
bookkeeper for the Street Department,
has been missing from his desk since
Friday afternoon and the only trace of
him that he has left behind is a short
age of $1154 in his accounts with Bier &
Regensburger, the warrant brokers.
Although McGlade has been operating
since May 1, with prospect of discovery
staring him in the face on the first of
every month, his crookedness was not
discovered until Monday morning, when
a letter from his brokers notified Su
perintendent Ambrose that they had
a half-dozen labor tabs dating back to
the Ist of May for which they had
never received warrants. A hasty
glance at the books disclosed the fact
that all of the names in which the tabs
were made out were fictitious, and that
McGlade had signed each order. Ex
pert Derham was at once put to work
and yesterday he had figured that the
missing deputy had realized $1154 up to
November 1.
McGlade's method was as simple as it
was clumsy. Finding himself in need
of money after a night's bout or an off
day at the track he would issue a tab
to J. Radumsky or J. Kelley, or to some
other fictitious person, stating that the
bearer had performed thirty days' labor
for the Street Department at ?4 per
day, for which a warrant would issue
on the Ist of the month following. This
tab would be hypothecated at the
brokers for a matter of 2 per cent dis
count and McGlade would pocket the
returns. Ordinarily he would have
been discovered at the end of his first
month, for it is the custom of the
brokers to demand the warrants for
these tabs as soon as they fall due.
Bier & Regensburger, however, al
lowed the accounts to run along until
the first of the present week, when the
crash came too late to find McGlade at
home.
So far as investigation has progressed
THE EDITORIAL THAT
CAUSED A RACE WAR
The trouble in Wilmington, N. C, broke out on the day after election.
The chief cause alleged was an editorial printed in a paper edited by a
mulatto named Alex L. Manley. It reads as follows:
A Mrs. Felton, from Georgia, makes a speech before the agricultural society
at Tybee, Ga., in which she advocates lynching as an extreme measure. This
woman makes a strong plea for womanhood, and if the alleged crimes of race
were half bo frequent as ofttimes reported her plea would be worthy of con
sideration.
Mrs. Felton. like so many other so-called Christians, loses sight of the basic
principle of the religion of Christ in her plea for one class of people as against
another. If a missionary spirit is essential for the uplifting of the poor white
girls, why is it? The morals of the poor white people are on a par with their
colored neighbors of like conditions, and if any one doubts the statement let
him visit among them. The whole lump needs to be leavened by those who pro
fess so much religion and showing them that the preservation of virtue is an
essential for the life of any people.
Mrs. Felton begins well, for she admits that education will better protect girls
on the farm from the assaulter. This we admit, and it should not be confined to
the white any more than to the colored girls. The editors pour forth volleys of
aspersions against all negroes because of the few who may be guilty. If the
papers and speakers of tht other race would condemn the commission of crime
because it is crime, and not try to make it appear that the negroes were the only
criminals, thtey would find their strongest allies in the Intelligent negroes them
selves, and together the whites and blacks would root the evil out of both races.
We suggest that the whites guard their women more closely, as Mrs. Felton
says, thus giving no opportunity for the human fiend, be he white or black.
You leave your goods out of doors and then complain because they are taken
away. Poor white men are careless in the matter of protecting their women, es
pecially on farms. They are careless of their conduct toward them, and our ex
perience among poor white people in the country teaches us that the women of
that race are not any more particular in the matter of clandestine meetings with
colored men than are the white men with colored women. Meetings of this kind
go on for some time, until the woman's infatuation or the man's boldness brings
attention to them and the man is lynched. Every negro lynched is
called a "big, burly black brute," when in fact many of those who have thus
been dealt with had white men for their fathers, and were not only not "black"
and "burly," but were sufficiently attractive for white.gins of culture and re
finement to fall in love with them, as is well known to all.
Mrs. Felton must begin at the fountain-head if she wishes to purify the
stream.
Teach your men purity. Let virtue be something more than an excuse for
them to intimidate and torture a helpless people. Tell your men that it is no
worse for a black man to be intimate with a white woman than for a white
man to be intimate with a colored woman.
You set yourselves down as a lot of carping hypocrites; in fact, you cry aloud
for the virtue of your women while you seek to destroy the morality of ours.
Don't think ever that your women will remain pure while you are debaucning
ours. You sow the seed â the harvest will come in due time.
Two days later. Mrs. W. H. Felton, wife of ex-Congressman Felton of
Georgia, upon whose speech at Tybee Island Manley's editorial commented,
gave the following signed statement to the press:
CARTERSVILLE, Ga., Nov. 15.
It is a disgrace in a free country when violence is a public reproach and the best
part of God's creation are trembling and afraid to be left alone in their homes.
With due respect to Southern politics I say that when you take the negro
Into your embraces on election day to control his vote and use liquor to be
fuddle his understanding and make him believe he is a man and a brother,
when you honey-snuggle him at the polls and make him familiar with dirty tricks
in politics so long will lynchings prevail, because the cause will grow and in
crease with every election when there Is not enough religion in the pulpit to
organize a crusade against this sin, nor Justice in the courthouse to promptly
punish the crime, nor manhood enough in the nation to put a sheltering arm
about innocence and virtue.
If it requires lynching to protect woman s dearest possession from ravening
drunken human beasts, then I say lynch a thousand negroes a week, if it is'
Since my Tybee address was made the crime and lynchings have decreased
50 Der cent in Georgia. The condition in North Carolina Is the manifest result
of corruption in politics and undue familiarity with North Carolina negroes at
the polls. It is the unwritten law in Georgia that a black fiend who destroys a
white woman In her home or on the highway, and is identified with proof posi
tive must die without clergy, Judge or jury. I know that tens of thousands of
honorable colored men and women in Georgia will approve the verdict.
The black race will be destroyed by the whites in self-defense unless law
and order prevail in regard to the crime of rape and the lynching that follows
I nlace the blame where it should be In my Tybee address. Such politics will
ruin the prosperity of the South and destroy the colored race at last.
When the negro Manley attributed the crime of rape to intimacy between
negro men and white women of the South the slanderer should be made to fear
a Iyncher's rope rather than occupy a place in New York newspapers.

the brokers are the only losers. Mc-
Glade's account with his office is ap
parently perfectly straight, although
Superintendent Ambrose is looking for
something in the way of forged orders
on the treasury. The brokers have not
yet put the matter in the hands of the
police, but a thorough search is being
quietly made for the missing deputy by
those who are most interested.
Peter McGlade has been for years a
popular figure in local politics and
sportdom. Four years ago he was de
feated by Lew Brown for the office of
Secretary of State, and when Governor
Budd went Into office he was made
chief deputy of the Registrar's office.
He remained there for two years, when
he resigned to take the position of
which he has just deprived himself in
the Street Department.
His shortage has not yet been offi
cially brought to the notice of the po
lice, but a thorough search is being
made for him. The police say that the
last seen of him was on Friday after
noon, when he dropped in to a McAl
lister street saloon and said he was on
his way to the Hammam baths. A
number of his intimates, however,
claim to have talked with him on Mar
ket street on Sunday afternoon, that he
has not fled the city, and that he will
be on hand when needed.
Superintendent Ambrose is much dis
turbed over the transgressions of his
deputy. Asked as to McGlade's short
age, he said: 1
"McGlade's shortage in no way af
fects my office. The loss is the
brokers', so far as we know, but I have
started an investigation of the books
to find whether or not he has drawn
any fraudulent orders on the treasury.
I do not know what to make Â»Â£ Mc-
Glade's crookedness. He had a good
salary, was highly esteemed and could
have had almost anything he asked for,
and yet here he goes wrong for a beg
garly $1100. I have always known him
for an honest and upright man. I have
not heard that he gambled or that he
drank to excess, and I have liked him;
but I must say that if he is the sort of
man circumstances make it appear, I
have no sympathy for him. I do not
know what action the brokers will take
against him. I can take none at all
unless it is discovered that the city has
lost by his transactions."

DEATH OF A VETERAN
OF MEXICO'S WARS.
p APTAINA.DE LA TORRE SB., who ,
I for more "than; twenty-Seven years
li was '.' commander of * : the. Mexican â .
military company, the Juarez Guard
of this city, died in San Rafael on
Tuesday, November 29, after a long ill
ness. Captain de la Torre was a grid
uate of the National Military Academy of
Mexico, and was an officer in the army
of Mexico for many years. . He saw
service in the field â  during the French
invasion of Mexico in 1862.
He came to San Francisco in ISÂ«7 and
he has resided here ever since. In IS7I
he organized the Juarez Guard In this
city and was captain of thi organiza
tion for . twenty years. He has.
always been a prominent leader of the
Mexican colony of this city, and was
well known in National Guard and other
military circles here. !
The body was brought to this city
from San Rafael yesterday, and it is
now lying at the funeral parlors of J. S.
Godeau. 305 Montgomery avenue. Cap
tain de la Torre was the father of A. de
la Torre Jr.. who for some years has

to ~Â£y.AÂ£ rather
excitedly declared that the arr^t of the
women was wholly unwarranted.
"This is the most villainous presecu
tlon I ever heard of." he thundered put.
â¢You come here as a police practition
er," excitedly retorted, Shadburne. 'All
wÂ» want is a fair deal."
"I am here to protect the property own
ers of Bacon place." replied Ach, with
considerable bitterness. "Personally I do
not know that the evil exists in the alley.
1 have seen officers enter the alley and
with Jane Doe warrants arrest a number
of Inmates. In several cases unfortunate
women were booked on three charges of
â  vagrancy. Of course when the matter
was called to the attention of the Judge
I who issued the ( warants they were
. promptly released.!' ;
The opposing counsel declared that Ach
knew that the evil: was existing in Bacon
place. 'â¢â â¢â : \ ':
"The assertion that he does not know of
its existence is ridiculous,"' he remarked.
"As Police Commissioners It is your duty
to suppress the evil. You know that vice
is rampant in this city, and it falls to you
to eradicate it. Every officer of the law
knows that the women of Bacon place are
of immoral character. The alley Is barri
caded, so that the women may continue
to flaunt their shame, It is a disgrace to
the legal profession to s6e an attorney
like Mr. Ach lend his voice in trying to
firevent us from driving out these shame
ess Women. Ach knows that immorality
exists in Bacon place, and he dare not
deny it."
"Do you know that prostitution exists,
in Bacon place?" Inquired President To
bin. *
"Yes, and you know it, too, sarcastic
ally replied Shadburne, "and it is your
duty to suppress it."
Tobin explained that he knew it from
' hearsay, but had no personal knowledge
of it.
Chief Lees, who up to this time had re
'â  mained silent, took a hand in the discus-
I sion. After throwing bouquets at himself
! for closing Qulncy and St. Marys streets
he proceeded to closely question Shad
; burne. evidently for the purpose of find
' ing out whether or not he was considered
j of more importance than Secretary Kane.
Tiring of his questions President Tobin
adjourned the farcical investigation, after
ordering the attorney to tile written
statements of their respective conten
tions. â -..... . â

ciety for the Suppression of Vice, visited
Bacon place with thirty-two warrants,
and arrested P. C. Clapp and three
I women, who were released on ball of $253
each.
WILL TEAR DOWN THE GATE.
Mayor Phelan has taken up the cudgel
| for those who are trying to close Bacon
place, and with it he proposes to beat
down the big Iron gate that was built
across the alley to hide the iniquity
within. To this end he yesterday ad
dressed the following letter to Superin
tendent of Streets Ambrose:
November 30, 1898.
Hon. w. F. Ambrose, Superintendent of
Streetsâ Dear Sir: My attention has been
called to the fact that Bacon place, off
Fine street, between Kearny and Dupont.
Is obstructed by a gateway, which has been
j erected without proper authority. Ah effort
is being made by Interested parties to rid
the neighborhood and this street in parti
cular of tenants uslns the same for un
lawful puriiuses. They claim that the re
moval of the gates will facilitate the ac
complishment of their object, and that
while this street remains in Its present con
dition it forms a nucleus for vice and en
dangers the success of the movement. Fur
thermore, thf-y express the fear thnt the
I ground already gained will be loet by con-
I nlving at the unlawful occupancy of Bacon
place. As It is the policy of the city \o
purify this neighborhood, for which the
Supervisors have already made an appro
priation for a public park, there Is every
X â "â â ! reason why you Bhould act promptly
in this matter. I therefore direct you to
forthwith remove the paid (rates and open
the street for traffic. Yours respectfully,
JAMES D. PHELAN, Mayor.
CLOSING OF BACOiM PLACE.
â¢
When the cases of the women arrested
in Bacon place were called in Judge Con
lan's court yesterday morning It was ex
pected that Attorney Ach would make his
motion for a change of venue, but he was
silent on the subject.
The Judge expresred the opinion that
the officers were exceeding their duty by
rearresting the women on a second offense
before the first one of a similar character
had been tried ajid decided. He instructed
his clerk to mark the secondary crimes
charged against the defendants dismissed.
Attorney Ach then asked the Judge to
rule that the defendants need not come to
court every day, hut only when summoned
for trial. He contended that under the
law people charged with crimes could be
arraigned in court without being in at
tendance. The Judge so ordered, and the
cases were continued till Monday.

Landed the Berkeley
Handicap Cleverly.
MT. M'GREGOR RAN UNPLACED
ZAMAR GIVEN A RACE AT THE
STAR'x'.
Favorites Were All Beaten â Barney
Schreiber's Colors Prominent.
Major Cook Won at Odds
of 15 to 1.
Nash Turner, one of the latest Im
portations in the riding lino from the
Eastern country, may make some bad
fumbles in the saddle, but he furnished a
ride yesterday that will offset two or
three miscues. The Texas boy sat astride
"Daggie" Smith's mare Torsida, carrying
128 pounds, in the Berkeley high weight
handicap, and the major portion of the
crowd figured her out of it. In the ring
she was a 4 to 1 choice, the favorite being
Mt. McGregor 11. The latter led into the
stretch, where he was passed by Schreib
er's Good Hope. By a bit of perseverance
Turner gradually slipped TorÂ«ida into sec
ond place, and then going at Bullman
with a rush, beat Good Hope a head on
the post. It was a neat piece of horse
manship, and was well appreciated by the
crowd. The favorite was unable to crowd
inside the money, the short end of the
coin falling to Rio Chico.
The track was very heavy, and form
was at a discount, all rive favorites going
down to defeat. Ferguson, too, was in
wretched form, the majority of his starts
being very ragged.
In the last race of the day, the start
made a gift of the purse to Zamar, backed
all around the ring by Purser, Charley
(juinn and Coleman. "Skeets" Martin
beat the gate half a dozen lengths, and
then barely downed Pat Morrissey, the
favorite, half a length. The others had 1
no chance.
Barney Schreiber's colt Jerry Hunt took
the opening scramble for two-year-olds.
Going to the post a 3 to 1 chance, he led
all the way, winning cleverly from Tlb
uron, a 30 to 1 shot. Reina de Cuba, the
favorite, was third.
In the sprint next decided over the
futurity course, Major Cook, ft 15 to 1 shot,
with Devin in the saddle, led from start
to finish, beating the favorite. Sweet Wil
liam, two lengths. Ricardo, a rank out
sider, snatched the show from Lady Bri
tannic. The latter ran very much as if
her rider didn't like her chances. She was
piloted by I. Powell.
Barney Schreiber's colors were again
carried to the front in the mile selling
event, this time by Imperious, with J.
Ward up. The Morello gelding easily out
footed the even money favorite, Step
about, through the stretch, winning easily
by eight lengths. Prince Blazes secured
the show.
Track Notes.
For the first time since his return from
the East Spencer was seen in the saddle.
He had the mount on O'Fleta In the sec
ond event, and was unplaced.
Bookmaker Hugh Jones received a tele
gram from home yesterday conveying the
sad intelligence of the death of his father.
Johnny Coleman lost over $1500 on the
opening event and quit more than $4000
winner on the day.
William Murry's horses will be sold at
Occidental Horse Exchange to-morrow
night.
Earl Islington was played for a killing,
but little Stimpson couldn't manage him
in the heavy going.

The bride looked extremely lovely in
her exquisite bridal robe of cream white

Smythe wore a pretty Imported gown of
pink satin and white lace. Mrs. Cook,

A Native Born Felon.
Ah J.en was discharged from the peni
tentiary at San Quentin several weeks
ago. having completed a term of Im
prisonment for homicide. He was rear
rested under a section of the exclusion
act, which provides that natives of
China Imprisoned In this country for fel
ony must be deported. He alleged that
he was a native of California, and there
fore was not affected by the exclusion
act. He speaks excellent English, and
for that reason the services of an inter
preter at his examination yesterday be
fore United States Commissioner Hea
cock were dispensed with. Ah Len hav
ing produced several Chinese witnesses
to prove that he was an American by
birth. Judge Heacock announced that he
would recommend a dismissal of the pro
ceedings. *

C. Lord and Theodore Birnbaum filed a
libel suit In the United States District
Court yesterday against the Pacific
Steam Whaling Company to recover
$5354 50. the alleged value of the cargo of
the steam whaler Navarch, which cargo,
they alleged, was unlawfully and for
cibly seized by the defendants and trans
ferred from the Navarch to the Newport

The cargo was the "lay" In which the
plaintiffs were interested, and was re
moved from the Navarch on October 2,
1597.

from Its inception to its close. He was on the
wreck of the Maine while the Commission was
sitting. He saw the volunteers called into
service, and visited Camp Black and Chicka-
mauga. He was at Tampa and with Admiral
Sampson's squadron, and he was at Santiago
from the beginning to the surrender. Mr.
Hemment was under fire with the regulars and
Rough Riders at El Caney. Ban Juan and else-
where, and he shared In the dramatic scenes
preceding the capitulation. He witnessed the
bombardments of Santiago and saw Cervera'B
fleet destroyed. Later Mr. Hernment was
present at Camp Wikoff and saw the return
of the regulars and Rough Riders and the Sev-
enty-first Regiment.

OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION.
The New York circular of Henry Clews says:
"For the past ten months the excess of ex
ports over Imports of this country amount to j
$470,000.0(10, against which we have imported I
over $120,000,000 of gold. Allowing for the re
turn of American securities and for freight
money paid out to foreign ship owners, a very
large credit balance still remains due to the
Unite* States. This showing amply protects j
us from any possibility of gold shipments for |
some time ahead. On the contrary, we are j
placed in a fnrtlfied position to draw gold i
from Europe to the extent of from $50,000,000 ;
to $1011,000,000 at least, whenever the situation I
on this side makes it necessary. While the call ;
money rate remains so much under the Bank |
of England rate, which is now 4 per cent, and
the Benk of Berlin rate, which Is at present
6 per cent, it Is a great deal more profitable
to keep credit balances on the other side; but ,
It adds much to confidence to know that we i
have the ability to draw at any moment against â 
the large cash indebtedness due us. For that ;
reason the small surplus reserve now held hy i
the New York city banks Is not in the least .
disturbing. While Europe has been losing
fiei circulating medium, which has compelled
th* Brink of England rate to go up to 4 pet
cent and the Bank of Berlin rate to 6 per cent,
this country has pained during the past two ;
years $350,000,000, which has been derived from i
our own gold product, gold Imports and tha j
Increase in national bank bills. This Immense. |
Increase In actual money is the real substantial !
bull argument backing the security market, !
mat fully Justifies the present advancing price j
of the sound and "improving properties dealt In ;
a: the New York Stock Exchange."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Nov. 30.â The market for stocks i
in Wall street hinged very largely to-day on ;
the financial situation abroad. Berlin was ;
again evidently the source of the pressure for j
accommodation, and its urgent needs resulted I
in the sympathetic hardening of the rates for
money at London and Paris, call â  money at |
London rising to 3 per cent. The nrlce of gold '
bars rose an additional fraction in London, but |
gold to the amount of 640,000 was withdrawn
from the Bank of England. Of this amount
11,000,000 was shipped to the United States and I
probably the rest went to Germany. The en
gagement for the United States was the out
come of the recent tendency toward lower
rates for money at foreign centers, which left
â¢o narrow a margin of profits on the with
holding of the exchange, which Is constantly
accumulating at New York as a result of the
continued heavy exports of merchandise. ' that !
the movement of gold is necessary to meet the j
obligations. The rise >in the money rate In !
London yesterday again effected a margin of j
profits on loans made abroad and the result I
was seen in a rise In sterling exchange In |
New York, reflecting a renewed demand for
Investment in sterling which will necessarily }
put an end to the gold movement for the pres
ent. The incident may be accepted as an ad
monition to the foreign money markets that
they must pay a good rate of Interest if they
want the use of the credits established by this
country's favorable trade balance. Otherwise
the activity of business at home and the needs
for financiering enormous consolidations and
the formulation of huge. new corporations will '
necessitate the calling home of. these credits. '
The effect of the tightening money markets
abroad was to throw a burden of liquidation
on the local stock market, the International
stocks, of course, showing greatest weakness.
In view of the large German holdings of North
ern Pacific it was perhaps natural that this !
stock should be most acutely affected. But
there remains some feeling of apprehension still
over the relations between Northern Pacific and
Its competitors. The story reported to ac
count for the strength of Union Pacific of a
plan for the exchange of Oregon Short. Line
stock for Union Pacific common stock Indi
cates rather an aggressive strengthening of
resources than a resignation to an accom
plished agreement. â¢â¢ as. Oregon Short Line owns
a majority of common stock of Oregon Navi
gation, thus Insuring an outlet for Union Pa
cific to the northwest coast. The letter strength
in the market radiated from Union Pacific.
Sugar's , strength was. due to the rumors of
consolidation with the .Glucose Company. Rub
ber stocks made the usual response to the pre
vailing gumshoe weather. There was strength
also In the few of the obscure low-priced
stocks. The rise In Manhattan ; was . unex
plained. The declines were largely recovered,
but the net changes of the day were decidedly
mixed.
The bond market Was irregular, In sympathy 1
with the stocks, but -business was fairly large I
and well distributed. Total sales. $3,375,000.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, ' Nov. 30.â Opening prices In wheat
showed slight recessions from yesterday's clos
ing figures," May â  and December starting 4c
lower. Trading was remarkable only for Its ex
treme dullness. . Liverpool by the time trading
commenced here 1 showed 4W%d decline. About
11 o'clock, a moderate buying demand was
caused by the excellent local cash business and
reports of heavy seaboard engagements for ex
port, and for. over an hour prices after advan
cing slightly were well maintained: May reached
the highest point of the day. 66V;c. about 11:30,
and December held comparatively firm at 65% c.
In the ; last -our â . of trading â  the market grew
quite weak again and continued so to the close.
' During this 'time liquidation â¢of - December by
j tired local holders and by , outside Interests be
came prominent. . There, was also selling by ele
vator Interests of both . December : and May.
Bulls â  were evidently , discouraged at the diffi
culty In maintaining prices and threw over all
j the market could carry and more, -too. Decem
ber closed. 65V4<ji 65% c. â , May closed at 65%@65%c."
Corn : was , Irregular. ~ Starting rather â  weak,
because clear,", cool weather prevailed,' the mar
i ket | became stronger on the excellent cash and
export business and â on storm â¢ predictions, and
a fair advance \ was scored. This was main- â 
| tamed until late In the session, when the slump â 
i In wheat started liquidation and the advantage
was lost.' : May closed ; h%'fi liC1 iC â  lower.
A good business was done In oats. The bull
i ish 'factors V were light stocks and â â  the small
i country movement. Â« Best prices were not main
! tamed, but the market was steady at the close
I May. closed a shade hlghr- ..->â .- ;
| Provisions were exceedingly strong, consider
ing the unfavorable surroundings. Hog receipts
j were large, but offerings of provisions â  were
small even from packers, Indicating that pack

Best in the Division of the
County Money as Now
Made.
After a day of dickering ana a half
dozen sprightly scraps precipitated by the
belligerent Rottanzi, the Board of Super-
Alsnrs, sitting in rxtvutive session, agreed
yesterday upon the distribution of the
1200,000 that has been added to the public
funds by the withdrawal of the garbage
contract and new hospital project. â¢ Inci
dentally they added $92,000 to the general
distribution by breaking their faith with
the people in rescinding the $75,000 appro
priation for St. Mary's Park and by with
drawing the proposition of opening Lyon
. street at a cost of $17,000.
All this was done in executive session,
and the deal would have been finally
passed in Open meeting but for the arrival
of Father Otis and Attorney Chadbourne.
who lifted their voices against the robbing
of the fund for St. Mary's Park. Rottanzi
and Clinton took sides with them and
forced a postponement until 4 o'clock this
afternoon, In order that the friends of the
park project may have time to use their
â : influence.
Rottanzi and Clinton's voices were the
only ones against the scheme to railroad
the' appropriations through. Dodge had
gone over to the majority for the consid
â¢:â â¢: eration of an additional appropriation ot
i to the Assessor's fund, and Lack
mann fell in upon a promise of $1200 to
build a flight of concrete steps on Joyce
â  BtT-CGt â 'â "â -â â  â  â  â  â¢'
In the absence of the Mayor, Lackmann
rnlled the board to order, and remained in
the- chair.' â â :' .
rk Russell had barely finished read
ing the when a motion to
order 126. the schedule of appro
priations made September 19. was in or
der Clinton moved an amendment repeal
ink all of section 126 save that clause ap
propriating $75,000 to St. Mary's Park, but
th. amendment was lost by a vote of 7
to * Tire original motion to repeal was
then in order, and was put and carried.
l?a.kmann, Rottanzi, Smith and Clinton
â¢^a n nzVand Clinton gathered^in a far
corner to consult, and taking advantage
of their absence Chairman Lackmann put
the question on the passage of the new
order It wont through without meeting
any obstruction. and Lackmann was about
to announce "other business when Kot
tanzi resumed his seat and inquired:
"What* become of the previous order.'
â¢â¢It's been passed." replied Clinton.
-It has. hey!" yelled Rottanzi. "^ ell.
I wont stand for any- such railroad
work as this In this board. I didn t hear
i- read, nor did I have a vote, and I m
not Kning to tolerate any such crooked
'â¢if y.uM been paying attention to

Lackmann. â â -.' â¢ ....

long since 'honest John' went over to the
Well, now, I've got an amendatory
order here and I demand a chance to read
it. It don't cut out $7:Â».000 from St. Mary's
Park and it opens Lyon street, and '.t
makes up deficiencies that your order
does not." , â â â â 
"Move we lay it on the table," yelled
"Gag law." foamed Rottanzi. "I want
to say, too, that it doesn't give Mr. Dodge
more money than he said he'd need to
run his office."
Dodge jumped into the arena at this
with an explanation of why he needed
that extra twenty thou, and of the things
he was going to buy the taxpayers with
it, and was only shut off when Clinton
moved to rescind the vote and give Rot
tanzi's amendment a chance.
Further action was stopped by the ar
rival of Attorney Chadbnurne hnd Father
otis. who had come in behalf of St.
Mary's. Mr. Chadbourne reminded the
board of its promises and paid the people
would hold them to account for broken
pledges. His eloquence moved Clinton to
a motion for postponement until thfs af
ternoon at 4 o'clock.

THE dressmaker and the usual fail

borers on the Market Street
Side Are Ordered to Stop
Work.
Three waterlogged mattresses, the back
of a mirror, two drawers of a bureau and
several bundles of singed clothing was the
net result of E. J. Baldwin's search of the
dismantled rooms In his burned hostelry
yesterday. To' acquire this collection of
junk he was obliged to pay wages to, half
a dozen men to clamber about among the
portions of the upper floors still standing,
at imminent peril to their lives, while
thousands of pedestrians and street-caf
passengers were also menaced by the tot
tering walls. <- :^! : ,'â¢ â 
A second gang of workmen employed by
the merchants. who occupied the Market
street stores before the fire, to search
among the ruins for valuables remained
p4uckily at their- work '. until late in ..the
afternoon. .In attempting, to remove a
heavy timber that had fallen from, above
and was braced against the Market-street
! wall the whale mass, swayed so threaten-"
ingly that the police on duty ordered 1 the
men to desist and get out of the place al
together. After they stopped work, only
Baldwin's searchers remained .to delve
among the debris, and it is probable that
they, ' too, will be prevented from contin
uing their search to-day.
â¢ If the police take- this action Baldwin
may see lit to begin the tearing down of
the walls. He was to have let the con
tract for that work yesterday, but did not
do so, and neither he nor his agents, Mad
ison & Burke, seemed to have any idea
when It would be let. â¢
â¢ A large force of police is necessary to
keep thoughtless , pedestrians from ap
proaching too close to the place, and the
officers on duty are anything but infatu
ated with the job. Swaying chimneys,
tottering walls and' overhanging â  cornices
keep them in a constant state of appre
hension, and while they keep one eye on
the passing crowds, the other, is ever alert
for the first signal of ,the crash that'
threatens to : come .at any minute. Not
alone are the lives of these officers Im
periled, but the city is deprived of their
regular services in order to satisfy ; the
greed of Baldwin. .When he begins the
work of demolition a high fence will be
placed around the premises and the ser
vices of the police will not be necessary.
â¢ The stench" arising from the ruins is
dally becoming more offensive, and it ,is
no longer necessary to invade the mass of
wreckage 'to have ; one's nostrils assailed
by the sickening odors. They are all too
apparent now from Market or Powell
street and they will increase until the re
mains of the victims still buried under
the blackened heap are recovered, which
cannot be done until " the -, walls are torn
down â  and the debris removed. It s is â  es
timated that this work will require sixty
days â to complete, i and every day. wasted

task of selecting not an easy one.
The kid beauties are to be ranged in
classes according .to the gown they
wear, and kept from coming in con
tact with ladles not in the same run
ning as their exclusive selves.
There is one table for the tailor-
made dolls; another for those arrayed
In all the elegance of a "calling cos
tume." Dolls in the fluffy smart finery
appropriate for the garden party are
massed together, and stare in haughty
disdain at the inanimate ladies in "re
ception dress" at the opposite table.
Dolls in ball gowns and dolls in din
ner gowns occupy adjoining tables,
and in the rear are the "babies," the
"two-year-old" class, and the "six to
eight" division.
An interesting baby table is the one
contributed by the girls of the Colum
bia Grammar School. Every stitch in
the exquisite baby clothes Is the work
of some industrious little maid. From
a needlework standpoint, the Colum
bia Grammar School table represents
the finest hand work in the show.
A contribution from Kansas, pre
sented through Mrs. Flournoy, is the
corn shuck dolls. These little things,
arrayed In all the beauty of delicate
cream dried corn shucks, make a most
picturesque display. There are two
distinct classes of corn shuck dolls, the

her dainty, beflounced dress and flar

Following up the recommendations of
the Fire Commissioners at their meeting
last week in regard to the lessons to be
derived from the Baldwin Hotel tire, the
Fire Wardens met yesterday and adopted
a resolution to compel the owners of
buildings of four stories or over to place
fire escapes and stand pipes on their
buildings.
The resolution recites that owing to the
fact that these buildings are "defective
and dangerous to the lives and safety of
the occupants and persons frequenting
the same, by reason of inefficient egresses
and facilities for escape in case of lire, in
and to said buildings, and by reason of
said buildings not being provided with tne
necessary- and proper protection against
fire, the owners shall be compelled to
place fire escapes and stand pipes on said
buildings."
A list of the buildings referred to in the
resolution was appended, and comprises
the following: 814 Sutter street; 906. 1020,
1104. 1126, 1130, 1236 and 1364 Market; 207

Merchants' Association's Offer to the
Police and Fire Departments.
The board of directors of the Mer
chants' Association met yesterday and
elected a number of new members.
As the new charter of San Francisco
must be submitted to the next Legislature
for final approval, the board decided to
send to the home address of each member
of the next Legislature a bound volume of
the charter, so that all members may be
fully informed of its provisions before
the opening of the session. Another copy
of the -charter will be sent to Sacramento
to each member so soon as the Legisla
ture convenes.
The board decided to donate a gold med
al to the Fire Department and a gold med
al to the Police Department on January
1, 1b99, and on January 1, 1900, to be known
as "The Merchants' Association Medal
for Heroism." Two medals will be thus
conferred to the two members of each of
these departments of the city who shall
be deemed most worthy by reason of he
roic conduct during the respective years.
No conditions will be attached to the do
nation of these medals except that they
be awarded respectively by vote of the
Fire and Police Commissioners, and the
award be publicly made in the presence
of as many members of each department
as the Commissioners may deem advis
able.
A resolution was adopted indorsing the
movement for cheaper ' postal package
rates and for an equalization of rates on
postal packages between this and foreign
countries. A memorial to Congress is
now being prepared in the East to this
end which the local organization indorses.

Detective Egan secured an interpreter
yesterday afternoon, and Barrato told
contradictory stdries as to how he re

fallen from a scavenger's wagon, and then
that he had a quarrel with three men near
Butchertown Monday night, and one of
them struck him on the head with -a hard
instrument. He had been wandering
around since.
The detective ' will make a thorough in
vestigation of the case before making his
report.
Canvass Completed.
The official canvass of the State returns
on the late election was finished yester
day morning and the Commissioners have
turned the balance of the work over to
the tally clerks who will announce the
result of the count on Friday. It is aaid
that no material changes will result.
The forty-day limit for contests is al
most up and the Commissioners consider
it improbable that anything in that line
will be taken up, although a number of
lively legal fights have been threatened.
It will be ten days before warrants for
election day services will be issued.

' There was Â°aÂ° clergyman ; in 1 a Long Island village who suf- '
fered from dyspepsia to such an extent that it positively, seemed
sometimes as though his doctrine was not sound. It was, however,
only a stomach trouble, and had nothing to do } with the mind.-
Being convinced of this, one of his parishioners, a lady, presented"
'. : hrm with a small quantity â  of Ripans Tabules and the relief he ex- . 0
perienced was such that all the congregation noticed an improve-
ment, and now, although his salary is small, this clergyman and
â  his wife devote a portion of it to keeping the medicine closet Â°
stocked with a suitable . supply 'of Ripans Tabules. . Doubtless
\ there are many cases where what â . has been thought heresy was in
fact nothing more nor less than dyspepsia, and Ripans Tabules curd
â¢ dyspepsia. ; One gives relief. :C v - : ' ; Â° l . â â¢ 'â 'â â â .'.â  Â°

MERCHANTS TO
PETITION THE
CITY COUNCIL
Opposed to the Sale of
City Land.
SOHST IS TOO DEFINITE
HIS MATTER RIGHT BUT HIS
MANNER DOUBTFUL.
The Sale of the Water Front Recited
as an Argument Against Part
ing With the City Hall
Site.
Oakland Office San Hrnncisco Call,
908 Broadwiy. Nov. cU.
The City Council is to be petition-*! by
the Merchants' Exchange not to sell lie
City Hall site. Director Soridt has pre
pared a petition, but It Is considered
rather too radical to present to the'Coun
ci!. â  It Is now being revised by a com
mittee of the exchange, consisting of
President Arper, Secretary Walk?r Hnd
Director Sohst. :â .Â»,â  -V?
Mi. Bobst'a report is based partly on the i
Information published in The Call that
there is no necessity to submit to the peo
ple the proposition of selling city prop
erty, but that it can be done by six vote*
In the Council and the assent of th?
Mayor. He says:
"We look upon this measure as a- fatal
blew to Oakland, which can only be com
pared with that of I^2. wnen the whole
â¢water front was bargained pway for a
school house and two small wharves. The
argument then was that the city was too
poor to buy a school house and wharf,
and property worth millions was Rac-ri
flced. History repeats itself, and some of
your members say we need money and ah
that is in sight to raise it on is the heart
of Oakland. They stand ready to sell it
to an English syndicate. That is no won
der, because no American syndicate would
take advantage of our people', when,
through a loophole left in the law, six
members with the Mayor, by advice of
our City Attorney, can sell it to John
Chinaman.
"Can the rtambers who favor the
scheme give thttpeople of Oakland a
guarantee that me Englishmen will put
up a six^story building on the site, as one
of jour members said thy.' would?
"Suppose we were serv.-.l the samp a-s
the people of San Francisco and small
shanties were -erected on the site. Would
it not' be a lasting disgrace? San Francis
co was not only disgraced by its Super
visory, but it is a reflection on the State
to have her metropolis defaced because.
In the eyes of strangers, the. height and
beauty of The Call, Chronicle and Exam
iner buildings and other public Improve
ments cannot cover up that' eyesore.
"All your projects .which you call Im
provements mean higher taxationâname
ly, building a new City Hall, free library
and buying a park.
"You will not increase the revenue ot
the city by carrying out your intentions.
The city wharf and licenses are the only
revenue of the "city. Therefore if you in
crease the expenses revenue must be
raised by direct taxation, and- instead of
$1 21 on the hundred you will need $1 71.
or the School, Police, Fire and Street de
partments. Free Library and free readinar
rooms will have to suffer.
"TakÂ« our advice; help consolidation: .
mako n sacrifice by legislating yourselves;
out of office; work, as we do, solely for
the best interest of Oakland."
Although the foregoing report will be
somewhat modified in the manner of its
presentation, the subject matter, it fs un
derstood, will remain about the same,
although the reference to "hypnotizing"
pome of the voters in the Council may
not appear. â  .

GOT MONEY FROM HIS GIRL.
Now Mrs. Sullivan Is Suing Her
Former Lover.
OAKLAND, Nov. 30.â A figurative
scroll of romantic history wap unrolled
to-day before Superior Judge Hall, in the
suit of Mrs. Kate F. Sullivan against
Charles T. Slamberg Jr., for the recovery
of $120 claimed on a loan. The ease was
appealed from Justice Wood's court,
where defendant had won a victory. In
1F94 the still fair plaintiff was Miss kath'-^
erlne Sheehan, a winsome, petite belle,
with whose chano*. the defendant be
came infatuated. In those palmy days,
too, Mr. Slamberg was the pride of tin'
local pugilistic arena. He earned many
fat purses, and the strings wore not held
when .the question of Ice cream. French
suppers, buggy drives, etc.. for his lady
love bobbed up. However, Miss Sheehan.
too. had money, for she had obtained a
judgment against the Southern Pacific
Company for a snug sum on account of
injuries sustained on a local train in
April, 1893.
Hut there came a day when Mr. S!nm
berg found other uses for his fat purses,
and his earnings were directed to the
family fund. " This, however, did not in
tf-rff-re with long moonlight drives and
other lovers' amusements, for Miss Shee
han gracefully turned over $120 to him.
Later a coolness sprang up, and th^n
Miss Sheehan married and removed to
San Francisco. Now she wants her
money back.
On the witness-stand to-day Slamberg
testified that every cent of the money
went toward the fair plaintiff's edifica
tion* and he Insisted that she had freely
given him the sum for that purpose.
Mr*. Sullivan, though her countenance
was wreathed with smiles, apparently
raueed by recollections of days of yore,
also testified, fthe claimed to have re
ceived a letter from Mr. Slamberg
wherein he clearly promised to repay
her, but she had voluntarily destroyed
this business epistle.
It was here that'Slamberg's attorney
moved for a non-suit, and as grounds
cited section 1700 of the Civil Code, which
precludes all claim where evidence or
an indebtedness has been voluntarily de
stroyed. Here an interesting controversy
suddenly hitched, and Judge Hall al
lowed until next Saturday to listen to
arguments and further citations on that
point.
DIRECTS HIS OWN FUNERAL.
1 L. P. Fisher Wants No Hearse, No
Casket and No Mourning Worn
by Relatives.
j OAKLAND, Nov. 30.â Luther P. Fisher,
the advertising man, who died in this
city yesterday, was eccentric, if any
thing. In a letter found with his will to
day he gives explicit directions bearing
i upon his funeral and burial. The letter
was found by Harry \V. Knoll, Mr. Fish
er's business associate, and the envelope
lls labeled: "No. ]â To be opened Imme
i diately after my death." In it Mr. Fisher
, distinctly requests that no hearse be em
ployed in conveying Ills remains to the
?rave in Mountain View Cemetery. He
, urtherniore requests that his body "be
i not placed in a metallic casket with
I mountings, trimmings, lead linings and
plush covering, but a rough box of the
cheapest kind."
Another paragraph enjoins his family
from making any show of mourning; no
crape is to used on the house or about
the remains; nor are the children to wear
black. He expected to be buried from his
home, 1203 Castro street, "where his
friends might come if they wished to,"
und he asks that a quartet sing "cheerful
music." The quartet must be composed
of church people and Christlnns; and Dr.
j George Mooar, Mr. Fisher's classmate in
Phillips Academy, Andover, Mass., is to
officiate as clergyman.
While Mr. Fisher lived always econom
ically, all the money he ever obtained, cx
i copt that required by his family, was de
i voted to religious and charitable causes;
i and much or his kindness will never be
j made public.
The funeral services will probably be
i held In the First Congregational Church
i early next week, by which time It is ex
pected the daughters and son will have
i arrived from the East.

WAS . TECHNICAL BATTERY.
Manager of Oakland Exposition Pun
ished for Enforcing the Rules.
OAKLAND, Nov. 30.â Manager Charles
de Garmo Gray of the Oakland Exposi
tion, was fined $5 this morning for puHing
a cigar from between the fingers of a vis- j
itor to the show. F. L. Gift, the com
plaining witness, testified that the cigar
was not lighted. and that Gray forcibly i
pulled It out of his hands.
Manager Gray told of the incident In the ;
exposition. He stated that Gift was in
the company of two ladies and was smok- j
ing. He was informed, and the informa
tion was accompanied by a slight tap on |
the shoulder, that smoking was against j
the rules of the exposition. A little, later, i
said Gray, Gift relit the cigar, and again '
â¢Gray approached, him. When Gift saw j
I the manager approaching he extinguished ;
the cigar' by pressing it against one of ,
! the exhibits. Gray then approached oÂ»ft |
and told him it was evident he could not
prevent him from smoking except by tak
ing the cigar from him. At the same time, !
said Manager Gray, he dfd not touch any i
j portion of Gift, not even hfsÂ» fingers.
Judge Moore said it was very proper to
! prohibit smoking in such places as a pre
i cautionary measure; but he was obliged j
I to find the defendant guilty, as there was j
I no doubt that a technical battery had !
been committed. He therefore fined Man
ager Gray $5, with the alternative of two I
days in the basement. The directors of
the exposition have decided to stand by j
their manager and prosecute an -appeal, I
claiming he was perfectly justified in ;
acting as he did.

Exposition Marriage Night.
OAKLAND, Nov. 30.â The State Expo
sition will probably close next Saturday,
after a fairly successful run of several
weeks. The attendance to-night was
larger than usual, since the special occa.
sion was "Marriage Night." The happy I
couple joined in the bonds of matrimony
were Miss Jessie Donegan and -Charles
Josephs, both of Alameda. When they ap
peared on the stage the exposition build

OAKLAND, Nov. 30.â A largely . at- I
tended meeting was held to-night bi the |
rooms of the Board of Trade to consider |
the proposition of holding another elec
tion and submitting the park bond issue
to the people. Auditor R. W. Snow pre
sided and stated that the object of the
meeting was to hear the views of those
representatives who were from the wards
where the bonds had been defeated and
to ascertain their objections. Jt is be
lieved that with more education and more
liberality to East and West Oakland
the necessary two-thirds vote can be ob

THE SAIST FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 1, 1898.
OAKLAND AND
VALLEJO FIGHT
FOR A DOCK
A Million-Dollar Prize
in Sight.
OBJECT TO MARE ISLAND
MR. HILBORN'S RESIDENCE IS IN
EVIDENCE.
Oakland's Water Front Said to Be
an Ideal Place for a Huge
Government Dry
dock,
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Nov. 30.
The largest vessels of the United States
navy In a huge dryjdock, giving work to
hundreds of men, Is the possibility that
Oaklanders see in the report of Chief En
dlcott of the Bureau of Yards and Docks
with reference to the shoaling of Mave
Island channel.
That Vallejo realizes there is a possi
bility of her losing the big appropriation
to be made by the next Congress for a '
huge drydock on the Pacific Coast is
proved by the activity that has come into
existence in that town. Chief Endicott
in his report practically condemns the
Mare Island Navy Yard on account of the
insufficient depth of water in the channel
approaching it. A prominent- Vallejoite
says that when old Admiral Farragut se
lected the site for the yard he did not
foresee the demand to be created by the j
great battleships now built. It is also |
stated that it will cost $300,000 to put the |
Mare Island channel in a condition to ad- j
mit the largest naval vessels to the dock
at all stages of the tide. While the tax
payers and business men of VaWejo are
Holding meetings and doing everything i
possible to obtain the appropriation Oak- |
land is not idle:
At a meeting of the Board of Trade this I
morning the matter was discussed, and Jt
was decided,. If possible, to bring this ap
propriation to Oakland. The. approprla- â 
tlon bill is now being drafted at Wash
ington, and Oakland is interested in see- j
ing tha#the one. million dollar item for a
drydock 3s appropriated' "for the Pacific
j Coast" and not "for the Mare Island
yards." â¢
In the discussion a humorous incident ;
was brought up. Mr. Hilborn has always
referred to his residence in Oakland as a
reason why he has a claim on this section ;
Jof the Thfrd Congressional District. Ed- â¢
i itor Pennycook of Vallejo nublishes an
article in which he says: "It ).as been tne
good fortune of Vallejo in the past to have
attacks on Mare Island counteracted be
i fore they have resulted in evil, and some
i of the most effective work has. been done
! by our own. fellow-citizen, and Congress- |
' man Hon. 8. G.. Hilborn. He is still at
Washington, and it is safe to say that lie
i has not been idle .since Endicott broke,
! loose."
. This reference to .Mr. Hilborn as a fel- ;
low-citizen of Vallejo caused some com- j
: ment and now that Mr.. Metcalf, solely ,
: of Oakland (.from a residence point of I
view) has been elected to Congress, there |
â  is additional interest in the struggle be
1 tween Oakland and Vallejo for that mil
lion-dollar appropriation. ,
E C Sessions, one of the best-posted j
men on water front matters in this city,
! has already communicated with the Secre- â 
1 tjarv of the Navy, giving aTI the data nee-,
essary to create a favorable Impression of
! Oakland's advantages as a place for build
! ing a large drvdock. He sets forth that
J the substrata iying under Oakland is in
! finitely superior for drydock purposes to
i anything that, can be found in San !â¢ ran
<i*oo, and also that Oakland harbor is
! accessible or can easily be made so to
vessels of any draught at any time. j
The Board of Trade has taken up the <
matter In earnest, and Senator Perkins ;
i has already promised to give it careful |
, nonatderatlon.
ALAMEDA AT A GLANCE.
Story of a County Told in Prose and
Picture.
OAKLAND, Nov. 30.â For the past ten
' years Alameda County has been steadily
I growing in all directions. Her industries,
; her. manufactories, educational facilities,
i commerce on the estuary, splendid dock
i ing system and all other developments
i that tend to make a county truly great
' have been steadily and solidly Increasing.
! Ip to this trme, however, there has been
I no publication containing a bright, at
tractive, reliable and complete record of
the growth and life of Alameda County up
ito date. The Oakland Tribune- has Just
I Issued an illustrated souvenir. Infinitely
superior to' anything of the kind ever be
fore published. The work commences with
j a brief sketch of the origin, of political,
i civic, commercial and religious life in this
county, and traces the development of
1 each iip to the present hour. ' Nothing is
] lacking, and every statement Is reliable.
! Many of the most accurate and talented
i writers of this county, some of whom
I have lived here over a generation, were
i engaged on this souvenir. Its value to
send abroad cannot be overestimated. A
glance through its pages proves conclus
ively 'that Alameda is In the front rank
of the counties, not alone of California,
but of the whole country.
A pronounced feature of the work is its
illustrations. Â»ln all of the 250 pages there
is not one that does not contain an attrac
tive half tone picture. Many of the beau
ty spots of the county are faithfully .pre
sented, and the industrial sections are
brought into prominence. There are over
200 photographs of people prominent in
every walk of life, and three times as
many illustrations of other kinds. The
work has been many months In being
compiled, but the labor has been crowned
with complete success.

Hoeck Soys Released.
ALAMEDA, Nov. 30.â Georgie and John
nie Hoeck, the pair of diminutive lads
who were locked up In the City Prison
last night at the request of their father,
were released at an early hour this morn-
Ing. At 6 o'clock this morning, as soon
as the father Baw a copy. of The Call giv
inp the story of his inhuman action, he
hastened to the prison and demanded the
discharge of his little boys. He raved at
the officer in charge and blamed him for
the publication and held him responsible
for giving the facts of the case to the re
porter. Hoeck has been roundly con
demned for his action. Last night there
was a meeting of several prominent citi
zens, who discussed the subject of bring
ing his treatment of the boys to the at
tention of the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children.
A ROAST FOR
THE JURY BY
GALLAGHER
Some Hot Words Be
fore the Board.
NO NOVEMBER WARRANTS
TEACHERS MUST WAIT FOR
THEIR PAY.
At the Same Time the Inspector
of the Mission High
School Holds His
Job.
The session of the Board of Education
yerterday afternoon, as was expected,
was one of toil and Worry. The members
were clearly worried over two thingsâ
the finances and the Grand Jury investi
gation. In connection with the latter
Director Gallagher found it convenient to
launch Into a bitter tirade against the
jury as a whole and Juryman Irving ;n
particular. As he made the gravest
charges against this body the solid contin
gent of the board resolved itself into a
society of mutual admiration, smiling and
nodding approvingly as the charges fe'l
from his l,ps. He finished his reading
with an air of satisfaction and sat down
with the remark that the story would
be "continued at our next." The matters
of finance were disposed of In a measure.
by cutting out the salary' of all teachers
foi the month of November.-
Gallagher introduced hie floral tribute*
to the Grand Jury by complaining of an
editorial In a recent issue of the- Ohro:i
cle charging unreasonable expenditures
in the furnishing of the Mission High
School. He took up the charges seriatim
and classified them as "lies," "misstate
ments," "false statements," "maHciolis
lies" and "unwarranted abuse." Then he
passed over his little package to tne
Grand Jury in the following language:
I would like to Bay a few words about the
various statements that have appeared* In the
papers of late Â«.nd are. alleged to be reports
from the Grand Jury: If those statements are
true, if if is a fact that some member of the
Grand Jury Is making the statements attributed
to him, then that member Is a scoundrel' and
perjurer and should be prosecuted as such. The
members of the Urana- Jury are sworn to
secrecy and to keep their own counsel and that
of their fellows, and they are not supposed to
use their -.position for purposes of intimidation
or slander.
The only, name of. a Juror that I have read
in the papers In that connection is S. C: Irving.
I have read, too, that he is responsible for the
apj>olntment of E. C. Kllpatrick as expert. -The
appointment of this man savors not of honest
and disinterested Investigation, but of simple
â¢persecution. The fact that this member has a'
grievance against the board is well Known, and
must have Dccii known to the Grand Jury. He'
entered upon .his duties with -the avowed pur
pose, state*! in the iÂ»resence of witnesses .if
squaring scores with Much members of the
be a--'l as has antagonized him in th^e past ' By.
this statement, if It is true, this man publicly
brands himself aa a crook. When I heard the'
statement I Immediately caused to be employed
a man for the purpose of preventing possible
thett or mutilation of our records.
In this morning's papers appears an alleged
re P. or t of - th| s expert to the Grand Jury in
which the amount of our shortage Is placed at
J. 51.000 These figures are simply ridiculous'
They give proof of, to say .the least, the rank
lncompetency of their author. His course as an
expert has been accomimnied by a series of
sensational and lying statements regarding the
board and its financed. I am informed in the
presence of witnesses that he has stated that
he expected to find immense shortages in the
delivery of supplies. He wan positive he would
be able to do this because he knew that princi
pals, as a rule, signed for goods without know
ing what they received. He knew this because
he had been in the habit of signing anything
presented, whether he received the goods or
not.
I anticipated just such a- report after listen-
Ing to Kilpatricks talk last Saturday at the
board rooms, where he appeared In not the
soberest condition in the world, and used his
best efforts to pick a quarrel with our secre.-
The resolution to. withhold the salaries
of teachers for the month of November, |
with the understanding that the amounts
withheld would be refunded at the close '
of the. present fiscal year in case there !
was sufficient money on hand to make
them good, caused a general discussion-.
Director Head opposed it on the ground
that the present board would be out of
power long before the close of the present
fiscal year and it had no authority to
saddle its debts on the new board. Argu- I
ments, however, were useless, and the I
resolution was passed by the usual- S to 4 \
Certificates were granted as follows:
Miss Rosie Ryan and Nathaniel Sanders
High School; Rosalind Kottinger, Millie
E. Mayer, Ruth Mclntyre. Mary T Swift
grammar grade. Renewalsâ Miss R. c'
Leavy, high school; A. E. Roberts, spe-'
cial.
. I,ife diplomas were granted to Misses
K. Q. McQuade, Marie Ruef and Nelllfe j
G. Walsh.
Transfers . were made as follows: Miss!
E. Fenton, assistant teacher in Horace j
Mann School, to receiving class in Red- j
ding Primary; Misa L. Radford from
Hearst Grammar to Horace Mann; Miss I
Lizzie Lavery from substitute class to !
probationary and assigned to Hearst |
Grammar; Miss B. Hemminway. to . new
class in Moulder School; MlÂ»s H. B. Fair
weather, assistant In HearsOGrarnmar to
unassigned list; Miss L. B. Harrigan from !
Irving Scott School to Hearst Grammar; i
Miss Alice O'Connor to new class In West
End School; Miss Lucy M. Wade from
Grant Primary to Park Primary; Miss
Rose Cassassa from substitute list to

stitute list to Washington Grammar; Miss
I. M. Roseman from Crocker School to
Irving Scott School; Miss E. M.- Carlisle
from Sherman Primary to Franklin
Evening; Misa A. Hawley of Franknn
Evening to Sherman Primary.
A resolution was passed closing the
schools from Friday, December 16, 189S to
Tuesday, January 3, 1S!)9.
The board will meet as a committee of
the whole on Monday evening to consider
the acceptance of the new Mission High i
School. A resolution by Director Head '
discharging the superintendent of con- I
struction on the building met with the
usual 8 to 4 fate.
SCHWERIN WANTS
NEW REGISTRY
FOR HIS SHIPS
At Washington Lob
bying for Contracts.
A special dispatch to The Call states
that Vice President* Schwerln of the Pa
cific Mall Steamship Company is in
Washington, arranging to have the
trans-Pacific vessels of that line entered
under American registry, in order that
they may obtain the contract for carry
ing the mails between San Francisco and
Honolulu and the Philippines. Of these
vessels there are threeâ the City of
Peking, of 5680 gross tonnage; the Rio
de Janeiro! of 3iV4.S gross tonnage, and the
Peru, of 352S gross tonnage.
Under the act of March 3, 1891, the Rio
Is of the second class and the others
of the third class. The compensation for
the second class Is $2 per ' mile by the
shortest practicable route for each out
ward voyage, and $1 a mile for the third
class. The distance from San Francisco
to Hongkong by one route is 6381 miles
and from Hongkong to Manila 600 miles,
making a total of 6981 miles. At $2 per
mile the compensation would be $13.W)2
for each outward-bound trip. The dls
tance by the second route by way of
Honolulu and Jamestown Harbor, In the
Caroline Islands, to Hongkong and
thence to Manila is 7568 miles. At $2 per
mile the compensation would be $15,136.
There would be about four trips per
year, for which the compensation would
be $60,544.
The vessels of the O. and O. line avail
able for this purpose are the Alameda
and the Marlposa, each of 3158 gross ton
nage and of the third class.
The act provides that all vessels of the
three classes shall be constructed with
particular reference to conversion into
auxiliary naval cruisers, an.4 that they
shall be of sufficient strength and stabil
ity to carry and sustain the working and
operation of at least four effective rifled
cannon of a caliber of not les than six
inches.
All of the above mentioned vessels ful
fill the requirements of the act.

JEALOUS RAGE
CULMINATES IN
WANTON MURDER
J. P. Gross Shot and
Instantly Killed.
JOSEPH CLARK HIS ASSAILANT
COMPLAINS OF ATTENTION PAID
HIS WIFE.
The Tragedy Enacted Immediately in
Front of the Headquarters of
Engine Five, Stockton
Street.
Through alleged jealousy Joseph Clark,
an upholsterer, residing at 919 Pacific
street, phot and almost instantly killed
Joseph P. Gross, the assistant foreman
of engine 5. last evening. The tragedy oc
curred immediately in front of the engine
house. Stockton street.
At the time of the shooting Gross, to
gether with Thomas J. Coogan and J. J.
Mahonry. both members of the same com
pany, was standing just inside the guard
rope at the- entrance to the building, when
he was accosted by Clark. The latter,
without warning, drew a revolver and
commenced shooting.
After the first shot Gross staggered and
made an effort to escape from his assail
ant by running to the rear of the build-
Ing. Before he had gone ten feet he was
pierced through the heart by the second
bullet and dropped to the floor, dead.
Although almost blinded by the smoke
from the revolver. Engineer Coogan suc
ceeded In passing under the rope, where
he grappled with the murderer, who was
endeavoring to fire another bullet into
the dead body of his victim. With one
hand he grasped the revolver, while with
the other he attempted to throw Clark to
the ground.
Before Mr. Coogan succeeded in getting
possession of the weapon he narrowly es
caped death from a bullet aimed by the
murderer, who with the revolver free
placed it over his left shoulder and
against Coogan's breast. Before he could
pull the trigger Aiahoney grabbed the
weapon from behind and succeeded in
wresting it from him. The murderer was
immediately placed under arrest. When
he learned afterward that his victim was
dead he gave a laugh of satisfaction and
said that he ought to have been dead long
ego. The cause of the tragedy, as told
by Gross' associates, is the outcome of a
long existing and ill founded Jealousy.
Clark, who is of a pugnacious and ill
tempered nature, was forced to leave his
wife and family a year ago, they being
unable ,to endure his cruelty and his negli
gence. From this time dates the com
mencement of the trouble that culminated
last evening in the murder of Gross.
When Clark left his family some time '
since, his wife, seeing no other means of
support, was compelled to take in board
ers. Among these was Gross. From the
statement made by Coogan, the murdered
man boarded at the home of the Clarks.

This excited the suspicions of the mur
derer, who openly accused Gross of alien
ating and trifling with tne affections of
his wife.
From this time continued threats were
made, but never until last evening was an
attempt made to carry them into execu
tion. Gross was repeatedly warned by his
friends to avoid Clark as much as pos
sible and take precautions to insure his
own safety and protection. The advice,
however, was totaly ignored on the score
that Clark was too much of a coward to
use any violence. Gross was 28 years of
age, and in addition to occupying the po
sition of assistant foreman of engine 5
was engaged in the draying business. The
body immediately after the shooting was
carried to the rear of the building and
afterward conveyed to the Morgue.
The only explanation that Clark gives
for the shooting is that Gross should
have been dead lonr ago.
RARE TREAT FOR
LOVERS OF MUSIC
St. Markus Church Filled With a
Fashionable Audience â Delight
ful Entertainment.
St. Markus Church, on O'Farrell street,
between Franklin and Gough, was filled
with lovers of high-class music last even-
Ing, the occasion being the grand con
cert given by Ernst Werner, organist of
the church, assisted by Miss Lilly L.

Becker, Miss Priscilla Davies, Miss Anita

Horstmann, H. A. Weichhart, J. A. Hang
and Alvin Maa.s.
The large and fashionable audience ap-
p lauded each number heartily, but owing
j to the great length of the programme
no encores were responded to, much to
the disappointment of the assemblage.
The choruses, particularly the ladles'
chorus, were well rendered, while the in
strumental numbers were all of the high
est merit.

LUCKY POLITICAL
PLACE-HUNTERS
FIGHT FOR THE OFFICE OF
CHIEF WHARFINGER.
The question of appointments Is still the
all-absorbing topic among politicians. The
next few weeks will decide the fate of
many who have been promised positions
by successful candidates, and It goes
without saying that there will be many
bitter disappointments, as ante-election
promises are not always considered bind
ing.
Attorney General-elect Tlrey L. Ford
will make some notable changes In the
present personnel of the office, the only
one of the present attaches who will re
tain a place being Charles N. Post of
Sacramento. Mr. Ford's first deputy will
probably be A. G. Sturtevant of Mendo
clno County. The place of second deputy
will no doubt b.e given to Fred A. Moore
Jr. of Oakland. Other appointments at
the disposal of Mr. Ford are third deputy,
two clerks and a porter.
The appointment of chief wharfinger on
the water front to succeed George Root
has provoked a lively contest between ex-
State Senator Percy Henderson, Street
Superintendent William Ambrose and
Harry Scott, the present assistant chief
wharfinger. It is admitted that Hender
son and Ambrose are the only ones In the
running, with the chances In favor of the
first-named gentleman.
Supreme Court Clerk-elect Root has al
ready chosen three of his deputies In the
persons of A. W. Johnston, William
Ward and J. J. Duncan. A controversy
has arisen as to the date on which Mr
Root will take office. A section of the law
governing his election states that the
newly elected Clerk shall take office on
the fourth day of December. It is held by
the best authorities, however, ,that this
clause is Inoperative- because he cannot
become an officer of the State until his
certificate of election has beerr signed by
the Governor. The general law states
that an officer of the State shall hold of
fice until his successor has been duly
qualified. This seems to u.spose of the
matter, and it is probable that Mr. Root
will go Into office at the same time as the
other newly elected officers of the State
Government.
THE SAN TRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 1, 1898.
POLICE "PEACE" CONFERENCE
Chief Lees and Captain Wittman Discussing "the
Good of the Department."
WITTMAN IS
NO LONGER
THE "CZAR"
Chief Lees Divides the
Central District.
BETTER HALF FOR ESOLA
HE WILL BE IN CHARGE 07
CHINATOWN.
The Captain Must Be Satisfied With
the "Fog Belt" or Resign.
Two Stormy Inter
views.
Captain Wittman Is no longer Czar of
Chinatown, and one of the choicest cuts
of the "tenderloin" has ~een taken from
the police platter and handed to Lieuten
ant of Police Fred Esola. This radical
and unexpected change In the department
Is the direct cause of two violent Inter
views between Chief Lees and the cap
tain.
During these "conferences" â one yes
terday afternoon and the other night be
fore lastâ the peace of the City Hall was
rudely shattered and more torrid times
about police headquarters are anticipated.
Whether the Chief will compel Wittman
to resign Is yet a matter of speculation,
and the result of his effort Is awaited with
keenest interest by the department and
the public generally.
Chief Lees has already secured one of
Captain Wittman's shoulder straps. The
Central police district, which was the
largest and most important division of
the Police Department, has been divided.
The principal portion has been taken
from the captain and given to Lieutenant
Esola, who has been acting prison-keeper
at the California street station. Esola.
whose authority is now equal to that of
Captain Wittman, is placed in charge of
the district bounded by Front, California
and Larkln streets and the bay. This dis
trict Includes Chinatown, Barbary Coast
and a large section of the water front.
More arrests are made in this district
than in all the rest of the cLty, from
fifty to sixty prisoners being brought in
daily to the California street station.
Chinatown alone keeps a large force of
police and detectives on the gui vive day
and night, and Captain Wittman's failure
to suppress the highbinders and other
vicious elements In that plague spot has
brought him into disgrace.
Captain Wittman retains supervision of
the "fog belt," which comprises the West
ern Addition, "Cow Hollow," Harbor
View, the Richmond district and the Cliff
House. Lieutenant Esola has a detail of
100 patrolmen to cover his district, and .s
amenable to Chief Lees directly and not
to Captain Wittman, as heretofore.
Chief Lees will not give his reasons for
degrading Wittman and promoting Esoia
further than to say- it is for the good of
the department. The Call's story yester
day morning of the row between the Chief
and the captain was denied by all con
cerned; but the radical change In the Cen
tral district fully explains the cause of the
violent quarrel and the loud words which
reverberated through the corridors white
the Interview was in progress.
Wittman objected to losing all but the
quill of his yellow peacock feather, ami it
was extremely galling to think that Lieu
tenant Esola was to be the recipient of
authority and honor stripped from him.
The motto, "Love one another," which at
one time adorned the wall at the old City
Prison, seems to have been lost, and none
of the officials of the department are
searching for it nowadays. In fact, they
have for some months been laying in a
supply of knives, hammers and axes, and
open hostilities are now at hand.
For some reason known only to them
selves Lees and Wittman have been at.
swords' points for a long, long time.
Wittman considers himself the heir ap
parent to the throne now occupied by
Lees, and as the Albert Edward of the
department he thinks the proper time has
arrived for the old lady to abdicate. Chief
Lees (who has been 45 years in the de
partment) Is aware of Wittman's aspira
tions and he doesn't like It. He believes
that no man (who has not had 46 years'
experience) can fill the void which would
exist forever if he were to leave the de
partment, and Wittman needs to be se
verely rebuked for daring to think he
could lead a procession or organize a
drum corps. Then, too, how would the
six-foot captain with the frigid feet and
big voice look in that nice new gold-be
spangled uniform. "Preposterous/ sput
ters the' Chief.
The strained relation* between, the
Chief and the captain of the Central dte
trict has been a matter of gossip with the
patrolmen and about the City Hall for
several months past. Not so very long
ago Wittman was placed In command of
all the police parades and he came to be
lieve that no out-of-door celebration was
complete without his austere and com
manding presence. Suddenly â¢ a change
canie, and the men In the ranks wondered
thereat. Instead of Wittman, Captain
Spillane of the Southern district was
chosen as the Chief's representative In
charge of escorts for martial and civic
parades. The wise men in the depart
ment talked knowingly about Wittman
being too rapid in trying to get to the
top, and of the Chief kicking the ladder
from under him. To-day these same wise
acres are saying the "old man's kick was
never equaled by a Government mule, and
he not only tumbled wittman but he
smashed the ladder all to pieces."
As Lees fears Wittman,, so Wittman
fears Lieutenant Esola. On 'several occa
sions when Czar Wittmah's official head
was in danger of dropping Into a basket
Esola has been named as the noxt cap
tain of the central district. Run>ors of
Esola's probable promotion reached his
immediate superior so often that the tem
perature of the latter'B- extremities
dropped several degrees. When- the cold
blood reached Wittman's- heart frost be
came king and he now has the warmth of
an icicle for the young man from Califor
nia street. The air surrounding tfte cap
tain became so cold and rarefied that the
lieutenant feared his budding hopes
might be blasted if he ventured too fre
quently within the arctic circle, so for
months he has made but few official calls
at headquarters. As for making a social
visit a golden star would not have tempt
ed him.
Other captains and lieutenants have
watched developments with anxious eyes,
and they have endeavored to remain
astraddle of the fence and rtot take sides
with the combatants. Captain John Sey
mour assiduously attends to his duties as
prison keeper at the central station pa
tiently waiting for Ben Bohen to retire as
captain of detectives. Seymour has al
ways been the Fidus Achates of Chief
Lees, and now he is credited with being
against Wittman. As the days go by the
happy family in the upper office is gradu
ally being brought into the arena and
each is compelled to show his colors; and
many of the banners which are reluctant
ly unfurled only add to the fierceness of
the battle. Lees knows that many of his
subordinates are ready to mutiny as soon
as a Spartan leader comes forward to as
sail the old man in his citadel.
For several days past an air of deep
mystery has hung like a pall over the de
partment chiefs. Their daily greetings
were apparently cheerful and cordial, but
those on the Inside were well aware that
a regular old southwest storm was about
to break. Discarded and unusual "pulls"
were dug up from various sources and
each awaited the onslaught of the other.
Isight before last Chief Lees mounted his
rocking chair, rang his new telephone
with a vicious twist, and ordered Captain
\yittman to appear before him forthwith
The captain was prepared and obeyed in
stantly.
The battle was on, and for hours It
raged fiercely. Two great big capital I's
had met and neltherwould bend. Wittman
r^, dl / an , d Profanely objected to the
Chiefs plan to split the central division
and give the better half to Lieutenant
Lso a. When his objection became too
torrid the Chief ordered him to keep silent
or leave the room,, whereat came the re
tort in loud and angry tones:
"I'll not keep silent and I'll not leave
this room till I get good and ready, and
you can't make me do either."
Then the Chief, with quavering, strident
screech:
"You'll do as I say. I've broken better
men than you, and if you don't resign '
when I want you to I'll make you."
Captain Seymour, who was an unwilling
auditor to this and more, got up to leave
the private office, saying, "I'm going out:
I don t want to listen to this conversa
tion."
Wittman, with ironical sarcasm, said:
Oh! you'd listen to anything," implying
that where the Chief was there also
would John be found.
This meeting was but a skirmish com
pared with the "peace conference" which
was called for yesterday afternoon. In
response to Chief Lees' "request" Cap
tain Wittman and Lieutenant Ksola ap
peared at the private office, and after
"friendly" greetings were exchanged the
"good of the department" order of busi
ness was taken up. In about a minute
the windows and doors were rattling and
the men in the outer office knew Lees and
the captain were mixing things again.
As oral bomb after oral bomb exploded,
the desk sergeants became alarmed, and
fearing the violence would lead to blood
shed they took turns in interrupting the
"conference." For a moment after the
first intruder's entrance all was still, then
as the door closed on his exit hostilities
were resumed with increased fierceness.
Both warriors had had an opportunity to
reload their lungs and the Chief took" ad
vantage of the moment to get renewed
courage from a glance at two new pic
tures of himself which face his desk. The
Chief always gave the signal for begin
ning the fight anew by defiantly shouting:
"I have been In this department forty
five years." Then the captain would re
tort, "I don't care if you ye been here a
hundred years." And so they kept fight-
Ing all the afternoon. During' the engage
ment Lieutenant Esola only smiled in
wardly and sat complacently in his
chair. He was certain the plum which
was being shaken down would drop on his
plate.
People passing through the corridors
were at a loss to understand the cause of
the great racket until word went from
one to another that Lees and Wlttman
were "talking over police business." Then
every one stopped to listen, and at ono
time half a hundred individuals were
gathered in front of the door from which
the roar came.
The only topic of conversation about
the City hall all day and among the
members of the Police Department was
the story in yesterday's Call that Lees
had demanded Wittman's resignation.
Policemen reporting on early in the
morning had read the story and comment
ed upon it. They declared that they had
long expected Just such a row and that
all the story had not been told. Rumors
of scandal in the department are now fly-
Ing around and Captain Wittman's for
mer shortcomings are recalled by those
who remember his trial by the Police
Commissioners several years ago.
Lieutenant Fred Esola, who now ranks
Captain Wittman, although he wears a
single bar. has been in the department
since November 4, 1892. April 4, 1894, he
was promoted sergeant, and In November,
1890, was appointed lieutenant. He had
charge of the old City' Hall for some time
before the department moved to the pres
ent headquarters. At the time of re
moval he was a lieutenant and was made
station keeper at California street, which
position he has retained. Lieutenant
Price will remain In charge of the China
town squad, but some changes among the
sergeants are expected.

THROWN OUT
OF A SECOND
STORY WINDOW
Attempted Murder on
Seventh Street.
A WAITER THE VICTIM
HIS ASSAILANTS LOCKED UP IN
THE TANKS.
Julius Perata Fatally Injured Dur
ing a Drunken Brawl.
His Skull Frac
tured.
Julius Perata, a waiter, is lying in the
Receiving Hospital with a fractured skull,
the result of being thrown out of a second
story window by his drunken companions
early yesterday morning. As the surgeons
believe he is fatally Injured, Detectives
Crockett, Graham and Dillon last night
arrested four men who were with him
when he was injured. Their names are
G. Calamara, P. J. Fitzpatrlck, D. Tren
ton and G. B. Vallejo.
Shortly after midnight Tuesday the in
jured man went to visit some friends at
900 Seventh street. While there he met
the four men who are accused of having
injured him. Fitzpatrick. it is claimed,
took offense at some remark passed by
Perata and struck him on the face. The
latter picked up a bottle and brought it
down on Fltzpatrick's head. According
to the other men, who witnessed the trou
ble, Fitzpatrick then viciously attacked
Perata. and after striking him on the face
several times, carried him to an open win
dow and hurled him into the street.
Perata's skull was fractured by the fall,
but despite the serious injury he walked
along Seventh, street until he reached
Market. A citizen who was passing at
the time seeing the blood flowing from the
wound in his head suggested that he ac
company him to the Receiving Hospital.
Perata paid no attention to him and con
tinued walking until he reached Golden
Gate avenue and Larkln street. He was
about to enter a saloon on the corner
when he fell unconscious to the sidewalk.
Policeman Pyle was at once summoned
and he had the unfortunate man removed
to the Receiving Hospital. An examina
tion of the wound showed that he was
fatally injured.
It was not until last evening that the
police learned how he was injured. A
scavenger who was passing the house on
Seventh street at the time saw the unror
tunate man hurled through the open win
dow. He informed Captajn Bohen, who
detailed three of his men to make an In
vestigation. The prisoners deny knowing
how Peralta was injured. Despite tbeir
protestations of innocence, the police are
convinced that at least one of them is
responsible for the serious condition of
the unfortunate waiter. Late last nigi.t
the latter was slowly sinking, and the
surgeons at the hospital gave as their
opinion that he would not live many
hours. '
TEN YEARS FOR MEADORS.
Gets a Very Heavy Sentence From
a Court-Martial.
Although acquitted by an Alameda
County jury of the crime of murder. Pri
vate James M. Meadars, Company C,
Eighth California Volunteers, will not
escape punishment.
Meadora stabbed Joseph Ury, a com
rade, during a quarrel over a Small sum
of money, while the regiment was in
camp at Sather station, last July. He
was tried by the civic authorities of
Oakland and was promptly acquitted.
The murderer returned to his company
and was placed under military arrest
and confined in the Presidio guafd house
for violating the sixty-third article of
war. Specifically he was accused of
"conduct to the prejudice of good order
and military discipline in drawing a
knife and threatening to kill Private
Jonas Ury of said company, for threat
ening to kill Corporal Thomas Silas and
Sergeant James C. Pitt of said company,
and for assault upon said Ury with in
tent to kill."
A court-martial was ordered, and on
September 30 Meadors' trial began. It
lasted for several weeks, and a few days
ago the findings were sent to General
Merriam for approval. The department
commander yesterday gave his approval
and made public the outcome. Meadors
is found guilty of the. charge and sen
tenced to dishonorable discharge from
the army, forfeiture of all pay and al
lowances due or that may become due,
and ten years' confinement in th<* Fort
Leavenworth military prison. There is
no appeal from this sentence, except to
the President, and it is not likely the
President will interfere. As the credit
system does not prevail in military pris
ons Meadors will have to serve the full
term.
Fry was Meadors' second victim, the
murderer having killed a man in Texas
some years ago. He had escaped punish
ment, however. He will be taken to Fort
Leavenworth at once.
