TWENTY=FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS
TO RELIEVE STARVING FARMERS
Check for Fifty Thou
sand Proffered to
Governor Budd.
Committee of Leading
Citizens Appointed to
Distribute the Re
lief Fund.
PLAN'S were devised and put into
effect yesterday that will afford
ample and immediate relief for
the destitute farmers in Monte
rey and San Luis Obispo coun
ties. In The Call of last Sunday state
ments were published describing the
extent and nature of the destitution in
that region. The intelligence con
veyed to The Call was at tho same
time placed before Governor Budd. who
announced at onoe that prompt meas
ures would lie taken to provide tem
porary r.-lit I and bridge over the dis
tress until the Legislature convened.
Yesterday a representative of this
paper waited on Governor Budd and
referred to the fact that at one time
In the history <>f the State when no
public money was immediately avail
able for the support of one of the State
Institutions, Charles Crocker advanced
from his own means the sum of $50,000.
and was subsequently reimbursed by
the State through action <>f th.- Legis
lature. The Governor remarked that
thÂ«re might be some difficulty at this
time in finding a man so generous and
public-spirited as to advance the money
needed to alleviate the distress in the
counties mentioned. The representa
tive of The Call suggested that the
Governor go with him and present the
case to Claus Spre< kf-ls. The sugges
tion was readily accepted, and they
called on Mr. Spreckels. who listened
with close attention to the Governor's
statement of the situation, and then,
without hesitation, Mr. Spreckels prof
fered his check for $50,000.
Oo\ernur Budd had no thought of
suggesting a greater sum than 525.000.
hence he was surprised and gratified
heyond measure at Mr. Spreckels'
prompt and generous response. The
Governor, upon reflection, decided that
one-half of the amount named by Mr.
Spreckels would be sufficient t<> meet
the urgent necessities of the situation.
"Very good," remarked Mr. Spreokels.
"we will make the chock for S.
with the assurance that if $25,000 more
Is required you can have it."
The Governor, desiring that Mr.
Spreckels should clearly comprehend
the case, explained that the question of
reimbursement would rest wholly with
the Legislature. The latter manifested
no uneasiness on that score. He said
he had given away larger sums than
that and if the amount should not be
repaid he could fret along very well
without it. He said he was taking care
of fifty familic-s in that region and had
already advanced $."0,000 to th>> farmers
of ; ri a t locality, which would be repaid,
hf> fancied, when they were favon !
with good crops. A large tract of land
which he purchased in that section of
the State had been cut up into small
holdings for the convenience of the
settlers. He had asked families to set
tle there and agreed to purchase the
products of the:" land, but owing to the
prolonged drought the land last season
did not produce a spear of press. There
fore he had advanced money and con
tributed supplies to those with whom
he was in that sense associated. Others
no doubt were equally deserving and
should receive assistance.
Governor Budd returned to the Pal
ace Hotel delighted with the happy re
sult of his expedition and immediately
adopted a plan for the prop?r disburse
ment of the relief fund. He decided to
appoint three well known men of high
character to supervise the distribution
of money and supplies to the end that
the relief should be at once afforded to
those in need of it. **Â« named as the
committee A. B. Spre.ckels, President of
the State Board of Agriculture; J; fries
D. Phelan, Mayor of San Francisco, Vid
F. W. Dohrmann, of the Merchants'
Association. The nature of the ser
vice which the Governor, requested was
explained to each of the three, and
they all agreed to serve as a sense of
public duty demanded the service
When merchants, bankers and others
of the community were informed of the
happy adjustment brought about by the
conference of the Governor and Claus
Ppreckels the utmost satisfaction was
expressed.
The whole question of affording relief
to those in need of assistance is now
disposed of until the Legislature sees
fit to make an appropriation of public
money. The relief can be quietly and
speedily afforded in a systematic and
methodical manner. There will be ncr
occasion for printing a picture of every
person obtaining help together with his
name and biography. A sack of flour
may be sent t<"> a family in need of it,
and illustratio |of the family tree will
not be required as a condition of relief.
Now that all the money needed has
been secured there will be no excuse
for importuning merchants of the city
every hour of the day to contribute
either cash or merchandise. Should
Governor Budd find the sum of $25,000
Inadequate he can go to Claus Spreck
els and get $25,000 more. There will be
nothing to justify any Individual or any
community in organizing a begging ex
pedition to visit the Eastern cities of
the country. The great and rich State
of California will amply provide cloth-
Ing, subsistence and seed for the dis

now confronting the State is that an
army of beggars will take the field and
in the name of starving humanity seek
to collect money for needy farmers.
Among the letters received .by The
Call yesterday was the following:
SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 19, 189 S.
Editor Callâ Dear Sir: Referring to
your several articles calling for relief of
the poor at the settlement of Lockwood,
Monterey County, we desire lo say that
we have received to-day donations to the
amount of t?2<), and are willing to receive
furth>r Ki-t* in cash or orders for pro
visions, which latter we hope that the
railroad company will forward free of
freight charges.
"We propose to send you daily for pub
lication a list of any donations received
by us. We have written to the Relief
Committee at Lockwood to send us a
list of the families in distress and of the
quantity of provisions needed.
Would it not be best to name a com
mittee to take charge of this matter?
If such a committee be named or should
organize itself we desire tc turn over any
funds in our hands to the same.

OERMANIA TRUST COMPANY,
H. Brunner, Cashier.
In reply to the foregoing communi
cation from the generous and public
spirited people of the Germanta Trust
Company The Call suggests that it will
â 1
not be necessary for any one to receive
further sifts. A committee to take
charge of the matter has been appoint
ed by the Governor of California. This
committee will doubtless authorize \
responsible agents to obtain a list of j
the families in distress, but it does not j
follow that the information so obtained
will be imparted to the public. Since ;
! an adequate sum of money has been \
| raised and since a committee has been I
i named by the Governor to supervise
i the distribution of supplies, it can be
; said in a general way that persons
I other than members or agents of the
j committee, who represent themselves j
as collectors and distributors of relief
! funds, are rank impostors and should
be treated as such.
When the Legislature convenes there
will be in the State treasury the sum
of $4,000,000. At present the amount ex
ceeds $2,000,000, but it cannot be appro
priated for any use until an act of the
Legislature authorizes appropriation.
The Governor, observing that the State
has appropriated more than $1,000,000
for the support of agricultural fairs, in
which horseracing is the chief feature
of the rural display, contends that
there is ample authority to use the
public funds to relieve actual distress
among the farmers. He is confident j
that one of the first acts of the incom
ing Legislature will be the enactment |
of a measure to reimburse Claus '

Spreckels for the money advanced on
the credit of the State to help the dis
tressed farmers of Monterey and San
Luis Obispo counties.
When Governor Budd went to Mr.
Dohrmanns place of business yester
day to ask Mr. Dohrmann to serve on
the committee, he found a solicitor
there importuning the merchant for a
relief contribution. The Governor put
an end to the soliciting negotiation by
the prompt remark: "There is no need.
Mr. rÂ»ohrmann, of making any contrl
butions to this cause. I am the Gov
ernor of the State; I understand the
situation and am in position to take
care of the distressed farmers. The

or authorizing any one to solicit relief.

what I desire now is a proper and time
DUNNING SWEARS MRS. BOTKIN ADDRESSED THE PACKAGE OF DEATH
The trial of Mrs. Cordelia Botkin developed a series ol sensations yesterday in Superior Judge Cook's
court. John P. Dunning swore that Mrs. Botkin wrote the anonymous letters which his wife received a year
before she was murdered. He declared that during his intimacy with Mrs. Botkin he told her that his wife was
passionately fond of candy. He then swore that Mrs. Botkin addressed the package of poisoned candy. Under
cross-examination he declined to give the names of certain women who were the companions of his revelries
in this city. For this refusal he was sent to the County Jail until he does answer.
ly distribution of the funds at my
command." $
The Governor's interruption upset the
solicitor but gratified Mr. Dohrmann.
Doubtless many other merchants were
interviewed yesterday and urged to get
in and give something to somebody.
The sentiment of the mercantile com
munity as expressed yesterday after
the fact was made known that Mr.
Spreckels had advanced money to af
ford ample relief was to the effect that
no further mention of the distress
should be publicly made. The point
was raised that the distress was con-
fined to a small section of the State
and was not in the nature of a calamity
which the whole world was invited to
contemplate, but on the other hand
was a little family affair which con
cerned Calif< >rnians only, and which
the State was able to take care of. It
was suggested that no further reference
should be made to the subject until
the committee was able to render a
report of the distribution of the relief
funds.
PEOPLE HIDE
THEIR DISTRESS
By C. E. Edwords.
KINOS CITY. Dec. 19.â 1 have just
returned from a sixty-mile drive
DUNNING SENT TO JAIL FOR
HIS REFUSAL TO EXPOSE THE
COMPANIONS OF HIS GROSS REVELRY
through the drought stricken district
of Monterey and San Luis Obispo coun
ties and for twelve hours have baen
an eye-witness of such destitution and
distress as seems almost impossible of
realization in this land of plenty. It is
not the poverty that is seen in the cities
among people who are improvident and
always poor. It is the blighting touch
of misfortune that has withered thÂ«*
energies and is sapping the lives of a
large farming community which has
struggled against adverse circumstan
ces for four years without a murmur
of complaint until now it has reached a
point where it is either death by star
vation or immediate aid from the more
fortunate people of the State.
In the territory lying between Chua
lar and Paso Robles there are to-day
500 families that need assistance. One
half of these will probably deny that
they are in want, but the fact remains i
and is plain to even the most casual ob- j
server. The ground lies absolutely
bare of verdure of any kind. Even the
live oak trees are brown and sere and .
only the stubble of the scant crop i
which was raised two years ago re- j
mains to show that the white and i
parched earth ever yielded anything
that contained sustenance for man or
beast. I saw the members of the com- !
mittee appointed at the Locksvood
meeting and from their lips got stories
of destitution that are heart-rending,
and even as they spoke the distress 01 ;
their neighbors their own sorry plight
could be read in the drawn look and
quivering lips.
No man whom I have seen to-day
has admitted to me that he needed as- \
sistance, yet but one of all to whom I j
spoke is in a condition to carry his j
family through the season without aid. \
Of thep*- 500 families requiring aid none '
are of the improvident class that is al- j
ways a burden. All are farmers and the j
great majority are owners of farms
ranging from 160 to 500 acres. Most of '
these farms are unincumbered and with
the taxes fully paid up, and the ques- |
tion naturally arises why do they not
mortgage their property. Two illustra-
tions will answer this:
One man owning a fine place of 160
acres with good improvements tried
to borrow $100 on it and could not get
even $50. Another with almost similar
property and with secured notes
amounting to more than $1000 tried to
borrow $100 and failed. Yet these men
have nothing upon which to feed their
stock or upon which to support their
families until such time as their farms
will again be productive, and it is these
men who are now in need of assistance.
There are but few families who are
now facing actual hunger, but the

Terrible Story of Vice
Unadorned Told
in the Court
Room.
John P. Dunning is a prisoner in tha
County Jail by the order of Superior
Judge Carroll Cook. Dunning will re
main there until he tells the names of
women of this city with whom he
claims, with shameless unconcern, to
have been intimate. The trial of Mrs.
Cordelia Botkin reached yesterday a
dramatic climax. The scene in the
courtroom during the afternoon has
had few parallels in San Francisco.
There were only two witnesses on the
stand and both narrated a story of
shocking immorality and unbridled
I lust. One of these witnesses, Miss Liz
| zie A. Livernash. related what she
! claimed had been told to her by Mrs.
\ Botkin. The other, John P. Dunning,
| pictured disgusting scenes and inci
dents in which he had been one of the
i leading actors. His testimony was a
I confession of his own degradation in
i which, if his manner of speech and at
[titude indicated anything, he took con
siderable pride. In a courtroom crowd
! Ed to the very doors he confessed a
moral obliquity that stamps him aa
despicable.
Dunning's material evidence for the
prosecution may be briefly summarized,
i This man, who admitted yesterday that
he deliberately deceived his wife and
dishonored his home, could do little more
than declare that the anonymous letters
in the case and the address on the
package of poisoned candy were writ
i ten by Mrs. Cordelia .Botkin. Beyond
j this Dunning knew nothing except that
| he had supepÂ«ted during his intimacy
i with Mrs. Botkin that his wife was
| passionately fond of candy. The rest
' was an unvarnished, revolting story of
j unadorned vice. It was a story that
j told of unbridled, vulgar passion in a
! man and woman without refinement,
education or the common restraints
of decency.
This story was told plainly, without
an effort to disguise or soften a mean
ing. It was vice in rags, the whisky
soaked passion of the Barbary Coast.
And the man who confessed it, whose
presence on the witness stand was
moral pollution, had the indecent ef
frontery to characterize San Francisco
as a city involved in an immoral at
mosphere. There was something of
horror in the calmness with which this
man admitted his own viciousness and
when he was released from the witness
stand to be taken to jail there was a
murmur of relief and satisfaction in
the crowded courtroom.
Hundreds of fashionably dressed
women, and girls who were hardly
more than children, listened to this dis
gusting recital. They were at a tension
jto hear every word spoken. Their eyes
I shifted from the speaking figure on the
witness stand to the woman before the
bar. There was in the manner of the
man an utter absence of shame and
across the woman's face now and
again would flit the shadow of a smile
at the narration of some escapade with
her former paramour.
There was no session of court in the
morning as a sister of one of the
jurors was dead. At the opening of
the afternoon session Miss Lizzie A.
Livernash, an occasional reporter for
'the Examiner, took the stand. Miss
Livernash had much to tell. Quick and
sharp of speech, nervous and positive
of manner, she related for an hour a
new edition of La Terre. As a reporter
Miss Livernash gained the confidence
of Mrs. Botkin after the Dover mur
ders had been committed and Mrs. Bot
kin was suspected of the crime. As
a witness Miss Livernash told what
she had learned as a confidant and as
an eavesdropper.
She related what Mrs. Botkin had
detailed to her of the liaison with Dun
ning. Miss Livernash tc-ld more than
that, and described what she heard
while listening at the transom of a
door. The witness covered ground that
has been tracked more than once in this
case. The progress of the illicit love of
Dunning and Mrs. Botkin was traced
from its inception to its culmination.
Scenes on the race course, at road
houses, in the park, in cafes, saloons
and low resorts were pictured. Orgies
at 927 Geary street were described in
merciless detail.
Dunning was represented in physical
and financial distress, whisky-laden,
poverty-stricken and mentally despond
ent. Now he was at the race track
squandering his money and that of
others. Again he was the recipient of
money from his jealous mistress. Now
the picture was that of a drunken
mother and her drunken son, one with
her paramour, the other with his mis
tress. The story from the witness stand
shocked even those who fed their
morbid curiosity with it.
Miss Livernash spared no detail in
passing. If one escaped her she In
â  terrupted the progress of her story to
i recall it. Tho great audience listened
i in absolute silence to the end to learn
; that more than once Dunning would
I have taken his own life had it not been
j for the restraining hand of his mistress.
j She fed him, housed him clothed him
[ and tear-stained, bade him good-by as2
he went to the Cuban war. Th>?n the j
motive Changed.
Miss Livernash devoted her second |
charter to Mrs. Botkin, whose confl- j
dence had been won. the witness ad- j
iXiitted, under the mask of friendshio j
and through the very hospitality of the j
accused wonian herself. Mrs. Botkin i
confessed time and ajraln, the witness i
said, her paast< n for Dunning. She |
had lived a pay f[te with no thought
bat pleasure. What others conceived
to be wrong was no sin for her. For
pleasure's sakÂ£ bI â  would stop at noth- !
ing, not < â  the divorce court, but \
Bhe would not stoop to murder.
Then in the same breath she would
Lim thai it would have been far!
:â  to have let the man die and !
spare the mothei for her child. Mrs.
Botkin, the witness declared, was Beri
rfusly disturbed over the shadow of sus
picion that had fallen upon her. She
argued whether or not the death of
Mrs. Dunning woutfl keep the husband
from her. She suggested the possibil
ity of marriage with her paramour, and
then dismissed it us dangerous. She
vais racked by fears and fa&cii b: she

She Bought her husband and thought ;
she was in privacy with him. but Miss
Liwrnaah was listening at the door and
heard Uv unfaithful wife demand of
her husband, under pain of exr
his amours, to Bave her life. She sought
her son and then feared him. ae he had
the power to condemn her. This in
outline was the story lUsb Ltvernash
told on the witness ntand. Under
-examination Bhe was m^rcilesslyj
attacked. Hi â  character was impugned.
her family was bitterly scrutinized and'
her moti\*i s doul ted.
She was released to give place to
John P. Dunning, the miserable crea
ture who had been the theme of her
discourse. There was a hum of ex- I
pectation in the courtroom when the
name "of Dunning was announced.
There was the rustle of dresses, the :
shifting of chairs, the murmur of voices '
as the aud ttled themselves for)
the salacious sensation of the case.
There was something: pathetically im
pressive In the question: "Did you
know Mary Elizabeth Dunning, a j
human being:?"
"I did," was the answer. "She was
nay wife."
With that preliminary Dunning re
lated the history ot his intercourse with !
Mrs. i ']â¢ told where and how
he met her and how their acquaintance
grew to friendship and then to Inti
macy. He to k < are that no one he!
knew knew her. With tier he avoided!
public places. Bought the back rooms of j
ns, "cafes," road houses, the race!
-â¢â . He knew her first as Mrs.
Curtis, then as Mrs Ad laide Botkin,
finally by her true name. :fe followed
where Bh< went, seeking her Bociety,
ompany, neglecting his I
duties that be might be with her.
Calmly and shamelessly Dunning;
confessed the facts of that intimacy j
even to the smallest detail. H e told
h.Â»w he deceived his wife, even show- ;
ing her letters to his mistress. At last I
t]ie time came for him to sever the re-!
latiohship. His dissipation had robbed j
him of the possibility of employment in ;
thiÂ« city and he received a position as j
Cuban correspondent for the Associated j
Press. He was without money or
friends here and he decided to accept
the proffered place.
Mrs. -Hotkin bflgrged him not to go.
It would be unkind and cruel,' she said. â¢
to leave her after their long intimacy.' ,
He should stay with her even in pov- i
â¢ rty rather than leave her. He was j '
determined, however, and tearfully : '
Mrs. B_otkin accompanied him across | !
the ferry on his way. That ended for !
him the intimacy which the prosecution ! i
claims resulted so tragically to Dun- I
ning's wife.
Dunning was then shown the an.
mous letter... He declared that they'
were in the handwriting of Mrs Bot- i
kin. He said that during his intimacy ! I
with Mrs. i; >tkin he had told her that I I
his wife was passionately fond of can- j â¢
dy. He then identified the handwrit- '
ing on the wrapper that inclosed the Â«
box of poisoned candy as the hand
writing of Mrs. Botkin. With that as- Â«
in he was turned over to the :
mercies of the cross-examiner. '
With the same calm unconcern that j
had characterized his direct evidence
he answered the questions of Attorney!'
Knight. He declared that he had 1 n
intimate with many women other than ;
Mrs. Botkin in this .city. He knew the ]
names of some and of others he did
not. He was commanded to tell the ''â 
names of those he knew. He declined i
to do so. It was the first indication '
of decency that he had given. He de- i
stroyeci its effect by asking time in
which to refresh his memory.
He was given a few minutes for this! 1
purpose, and then again declined to I '
answer. Knight pressed his question,
and Judge Cook commanded Dunninjr
to answer. Again he refused, and Judee
Cook ordered him sent to the County
Jail until he does answer. Assistant
District Attorney Hosmer made a plea
that Dunning asked for time. "Let
him pass the night in the County Jail,"
replied Judge Cook; "it may do him
some good."
The case was then continued, until
this morning. George Knight declares
that he will not continue the cross ex
amination of Dunning until his ques
tion is answered. This means that
Dunning will pass more than one day
in Jail unless he completes the despi- j
cable character he has chosen for him- i '

idiot. After the audience had left the
courtroom only the officers and Dun
i ning and Mrs. Botkin remained. Both
j were going to the County Jail. Dunning
I stood within the area reserved for wit
i nesses. He looked down upon his
I former mistress with hatred marked in
i every line of his face. The woman's
i answering glance was one of Insolent
unconcern.
Owing to the death of a relative of
one of the jurors the court was ad
journed from 10 o'clock in the morn
! ing until 2 in the afternoon, when Mist
Lizzie Livernash took the stand for the
J prosecution. Miss Livernash's story as
she detailed it in answer to questions
by Mr. Hosmer, is substantially as fol
lows:
"1 live in Healdsburg and know Mrs
Botkin. I saw her at the home of he
Bister, Mrs. McClure, at Healdsburg, o
the mornirig of August 15. At that tim
1 was detailed by the Examiner to visi
her and ask if she had any idea as t
the persons who poisoned Mrs. Dun
ning. She said she had not and spok
of Mrs. Dunning as being a woma
with many friends and no enemies
She thought the poison had been sen
by some friend who did not know i
was in the candies. I saw her again
the next d: y. being sent this time t
interview her â â â¢; to the alleged inti
tnacy existing between nerself and
Dunning.
At ftrst she did not want to speak fo
publication, as she wanted to consul
a lawyer. 1 told her to consult a law
yer if she had anything to do with
the tragedy. She said she had nothin
to conceal, and then w nt on to tell m
of her acquaintance with him. Sh
first met him in Golden Gate Park
where she was with a friend. He passed
tm a bicycle, rind something goint,
v, rorig with it he stopped near them
He Introduced himself and she wa
favorably Impressed with him. Th
next time she met him was at the race
course, when she lnvlteC him to call on
her ;it 827 Geary street, where she wa
living with her stepson, Beverly.
"He lived on Post street three llight
up, and she persuaded him to take the
small hall bedrooni in the Geary-street
house. This he did, anil they always
spent their evenings together while
there. Mrs. Botkin said he was ex
travagant at the races and was of dis
sipated habits. Had it not been for
her she said he would have committed
suicide. He was financially embar
rassed and she went to his aid with
money. She prepared .his meals and
endeavored to reclaim him from his
dissipated habits. He was In rags and
in abject poverty and his misfortunes
proved a tax on her resources.
"This conversation," continued Miss
Livernash, "took place in the morning.
On the afternoon of the same day I was
sent to her to tell her that she was un
der suspicion of having committed the
crime. Mrs. Botkin was shocked, hor
rified and became hysterical. She criec
out in her distress: "Oh, why didn't I
leave the man to die; I should have
! the wife and child.' Mrs. Botkin
decided to go to her husband at Stock
ton and prepared to leave the next
morning. I told her I would travel with
her and the next morning we starteu
for San Francisco en route for Stockton
Mrs. Botkin was heavily veiled. She
discussed a telegram printed in the
papers in which Mr. Pennington point
ed the finger of suspicion at her. She
said that if Dunning heard of her be
ing suspected of the crime he would
blow out his brains. She also suggested
that her enemies might have forged her
writing in the note that accompanied
the candies. She talked a great deal
about poisons and gave it as her theory
that the killing of the women was ac
cidental. She mentioned Mrs. Corbalay
a> one who might have done it. Mrs
Botkin said she knew she would be
suspected. She also said that if the>
can c together and married Ul9 strong
hand 0/ the law might be laid on her.
"Mrs. Botkin was anxious to go to
her husband, who, she said, would tako
all the blame for their living apart on
his shoulders. While in San Francisco
we stayed at the Russ House. I regis
tered, but Mrs. Botkin did not. She
kept closely to her room as she said she
did not want to be apprehended until
she had reached her husband's side.
She explained that Mr. Pennington's
suspicions were aroused by three an
onymous letters sent Mrs. Dunning in
five months. Mrs. Dunning sent them
to her husband and he sent them on to
Mrs. Botkin. She told of the dissipa
tions in which she had indulged and
a. knowledged having led a gay life.
She loved the pleasures of the world
and would let nothing stand in her way
to gratify her desires, not even the di
vorce court, but she would not stoop
to murder.
"During the trip to Stockton she told
of the life at 927 Geary street; of Dun
ning coming home drunk and of her
efforts to sober him up. She said Mrs.
Seeiey, Beverly Botkin, Dunning and
herself would come home from the races
and after getting on the outside of
Beveral bracers they would all lie on
the bed together and tell racy stories.
Sometimes Mrs. Botkin would get on
top of a chiffonier in the room and en
tertain the others with dances. She
acknowledged her intimacy with Dun
ning and said the world may see sin
in those things but she did not. Her
thoughts reverted to the murder and
she said that intimacy does not show
murder. She' also said Dunning was
her affinity and to live with one's af
finity was only to be compared with life
on another planet.
"In turn she charged Mrs. Beole!
Mrs. Arbogast and Mrs. Forcade with
the authorship of the anonymous let
ters.
"We left on the afternoon of August
17 for Stockton. I was to interview
her husband and was to do all In my
power to have him say the blame for
their seDaration was all his. We went
to the. Imperial Hotel, where we met
Mr. Botkin. They asked to be left alone
for a few moments. I went outside,
and the transom being open, heard all
the conversation that passed. Mrs.
Botkin was excited and pleaded with
her husband. She said. 'You must say
the fault is yours; you must say this
to save my life. If you don't I will
hound you and that woman into the
very gates of hell.' The husband re
plied: 'That will do; I don't want
her brought into this case.' In the in
terview which I finally secured Mrs.
Botkin supplied most of the material,
her husband merely answering in the
affirmative when I asked him if he
agreed to the statement his wife was
making for him.
"In the meantime Beverly Botkin, the
son, came in. He was in a beastly state
of intoxication, and was cursing report
ers and sending them to the warm re
gions. I tried to pacify Mrs. Botkin.
and asked the son not to create a
scene. I asked him if he knew Dun
ning, and he said: "Yes, Jack Dun
ning loves my mother and my mother
loves him.' The mother cried out:
'Oh! Beverly, Beverly, you will ruin
mo: 1 When Beverly left the room she
said tnr me: 'Oh! Miss Livernash, my
son has the power to damn me!'
"She. told me of her correspondence
with Dunning and gave me some of his
letters, but said she had taken care
not to give the most compromising ones
for publication. She also expressed the
hope that Dunning was smart enoueh
to destroy the ones she wrote him. She
said they were twenty-page affairs, and
couched in such affectionate laneuaev
that she did not want the authorities
to get them. She said she was an Eng
lish woman and believed in living as
they did. She explained that the women
have husbands who provide them with
all comforts, and that they also have
lovers with whom they livpd in inti
macy, and that was her ideal as to
the way to live."
At this point Attorney Knight of Th
defense took Miss Livprnash for cross
examination. His first question was:
"You were detailed to interview Mrs
Botkin. Did you tell her you were an

abandoned woman and living with a
man in San Francisco?" The witness
replied with decision: "I did not."
Knightâ Did you tell Mrs. Grant? Wit
nessâMost assuredly I did not.
Knightâ ln talking with Mrs. Botkin
first didn't you idenufy yourself to her
by saying you had a brother who was an
attorney? Witnessâ Yes.
Knightâ Didn't you tell her about your
brother dressing in woman's clothes and
masquerading on Market street? Wit
nessâl did not, ra,ost assuredly.
Knightâ Didn't your brother shoot a
man and wasn't he acquitted on the plea
of insanity?
The witness' answer was hardly
audible and was to the effect that
she had told nothing about her fam
ily. She was also asked if she did not tell
JVjTS. Botkin that one brother was trou
bled in his mind and that another com
mitted suicide after selling the story of
his death to a newspaper. Tnis was all
intended to break the force of the wo
man s testimony before the iury.
Knight drew from the witness that all
her traveling and hotel expenses were
paid by Mrs. Botkin. the consideration
being that she would prove Mrs. Botkin's
friend.
"You are her friend." was Knight's sar
castic rejoinder to this. Miss Livernash
said that she secured all this information
bit by bit, It being admitted grudgingly
by Mrs. Bntkin. The latter said that Mrs.
Seeley was the mistress of her son., and
that Mrs. Arbo,~ast had the same relation
with her husband. Mrs. Arbogast was
anxious for Mr. Botkin to secure a divorce
and marry her. but Mrs. iiotkin would
never agree to this.
The witness was asked if she had ever
told Mrs. A. F. Grant that she had gained
Mrs. Botkin's confidence by telling her
she was in love with a married man In
Healdsburg whose wife was a drunkard,
fehe replied thai she had not condemned
Mrs. Botkin â- 1 was not w.ih her to ex
change confidences. Mr. Knight asked
how she secured all this material against
Mrs. Botkin. She said Mrs. Botkin was
hysterical sometimes and talked without
reserve. Mrs. Botkfn had told the wit-iess
about the financial difficulties of Dunning
with the Associated" Press and of his
- at the races, but never men',
any amounts. To a juror she said that
Mrs. Botkin did not use whisky, morphine
or any other stimulant during 'the journey
from Healdsburg to this city and thence
to Stockr "i;.
John P. Dunning was the next and last
MISS LIZZIE A, LIVERNASH, REPORTER and EAVESDROPPER
Dunning's companion witness at the Botkin. trial yesterday was
Miss Lizzie Livernash, who swore that as a friend she gained the con
fidence of Mrs. Botkin, and then divulged what she had gained in confi
dence. When this failed, Miss Livernash testified that she listened at a
door to learn the secrets of the accused woman. While engaged in this
duty she was employed as a reporter on the Examiner. She told on the
witness stand a revolting story of the relations that existed between
Mrs. Botkin and John P. Dunning.
witness for the day. He told of his mar
riage with the daughter of Mr. Penning
ton in Dover, February 12, IS9I, and of the
birth of a daughter in December of the
same year. The couple came to this State j
at once. He first met Mrs. Botkin while
he was living at 2529 California street.
Although his wife was here, he met Mrs.
Botkin frequently at Golden Gate Park
and in numerous cafes in thp city. At
first she gave the name of Mrs. CurtiÃ,
and was living at 2217 California street,
three blocks from where he lived. While
his wife was here his acquaintance with
the woman was not an open one. He
avoided being Been with her in public
pluces. About this time his wife went to j
her father's home in Delaware, inking j
their daughter with them. After thin the
relations of the man and woman became i
more open and they were together every
day. At the time she lived at TIT Post
street, and he had a room at 612 Post.
He said he was not sailing under false j
colors with Mrs. Botkin, as she knew he i
was a married man from the first day of
their acquaintance. One of her first quea- |
tions to him was, "Is there not some one I
in this world who is very, very fond of
you?" and he replied, "Yes, my wife."
She told him she was married and that her
husband was in England. 'She was living
here to establish a residence in order that
she might secure a divorce. Later on sh^
told him that her right name was Ade
laide Botkin. She said she was born in
Kent, England, and that her mother died
when she was a child. Her father fol
lowed her mother "to the grave, and she
then was sent to a convent. While yet
young she married one Curtis, who was
much older than herself. She. then moved
to Boston, where she married Botkin, a
widower, with a boy then some 13 years
of age. She took him into her especial j
charge and brought him up.
The witness moved finally to !i2T Geary
street. Mrs. Botkin was living there, and
he had gone frequently to see her.
"Finally there was a room vacant in the
house," said the witness, "and I took it
for the benefit of Mrs. Botkin's society
more than for any other reason. It was a
small hall bedroom. Her room was on the
same floor, but in the back portion of thu
house.
"At whose request did I go there?
There was no request about it.
"I was frequently in the company of
Mrs. Botkin at that time at the race
track, in cafes, restaurants and hotels.
We took most of our meals at restau
rants together. 1 was in her company a
great deal, except in the morning, when
I was at my office. The intimacy be
tween Mrs. Botkin and myself was a '
closd one. She treated mo with a mark- |
ed degTee of affection. 1 went to Salt I
Bake in August and we corresponded all
the time during my absence. Frequently
her letters averaged one a week or ten
days. My answers were not quite as reg
ular. I destroyed her letters &% soon as '
1 was through reading them.
"While there I received a copy of an I
anonymous letter which my wife had for- I
warded to me. It was In my wife's hand- i
writing. It told of my life in San Fran-
Cisco at 027 Geary street and of many j
things objectionable' to my wife. I sent
it to Mrs. Botkin, accompanied by the i
answer I sent my wife. I had my sus
picion as to the author and wanted her j
Ideas on the matter. She thought Airs.
Louise Seeley had written it. We fre- J
quently tulked over it afterward when we j
met. Sometimes one and sometimes an
other of us would start the conversa
tion.
"About this time she told me that dur- j
ing my absence she had been divorced,
and that I had been named as the co
respondent. The proceedings were lnstl
tuted by her husband at Stockton, I did
not know until I reached Dover this sum
mer to the contrary.
"When I came back from Salt Lake in
August, ISD7, I went first to 227 Geary
street. I remained in this city then un
til March of this year. I saw Mrs. Bot
kin every day. and spent a great deal of
my time in her company. When not at
the office I was usually with her. We
spent our time in her room, at the race
track and in saloons and cafes. At whose
solicitation? I don't think there was any
solicitation.
"1 left San Francisco to go to Havana
as a newspaper correspondent on March
8. I left hurriedly at the time, as the
position depended on my reaching New
York on a certain day. I was living at
the Victoria at the time and Mrs. Botkin
was there also. I told her of the re
ceipt of the telegram and she urged me
not to go. She said that she thought it
unkind and cruel after our intimacy to
leave her at that timo. I told her I had
to go. I was in sore financial straits
and I proposed to take advantage of the
opportunity to better my condition. To
this she said it was better to remain in
poverty and all that went with it, rather
than to break the relationshipâ she might
never see me again. I don't know what
I told her, except that I would never
come back to San Francisco again.
"I received the telegram on Monday
and left on Tuesday evening. I did not
see much of Mrs. Botkin all day Tues
day, as I was kept downtown making ar
rangements for my departure. When T
left she went to the ferry with me and
accompanied me to Sixteenth street sta
tion, Oakland. She was much depressed
in spirit and had very little to say. She
cried on the -train and at the station
her manner was particularly affec
tionate.
"On a number of occasions I talked
with her about my wife, her likes and
dislikes. I told of her peculiar character
istics. I s;Ud she was extremely religious.
She was born in an entirely different at
mosphere from that of San Francisco and
she could not get accustomed to condi
tions here. She had a particularly high
kl#a of morality. In addition to this, I
told her that she was passionately fond
of candy.
"When I went away I told her that I
would not return to San Francisco, as I
had reasons to expect a permanent po
sition in New York after the war. I also
conveyed this information to her in let
ters from Key West, Havana, Jamaica
and Porto Rico. During this time she
ilia not express any desire to join me.
After the surrender of Santiago I went
to Porto Rico to fit out an expedition. At
j 1 once I received a cablegram notifying
,me i if my wife's death. Five days later
In Netv York I learned how it happened."
The witness was then shown the vari
ous exhibits of handwriting, the wrapper,
the note and the anonymous letters. He
gas asked, if from his knowledge of Mrs.
Botkin a handwriting he could state in
Whose handwriting they were. "I believe
them to be in the handwriting of Mrs
Botkin." said the witness slowly.
Mr. Hosmer tried to bring out the fact
that in one of the letters was a state
ment peculiarly within the knowledge of
I Mrs. Botkin. The- court would not permit
| tins unless the witness would state that
it was exclusively within the knowledge
of Mrs. Botkin and himself.
Mr. Knight then commenced the cross
examination that ended bo abruptly when
the prisoner declined to answer a ques
iÂ« on- He . lirst asked him as to his ident
ification of the anonymous letters writ
ten in ink and pencil. The witness said
he believed that Mrs. BotTtln wrote them,
but acknowledged that when his wife sent
them to him he cast suspicion on an
other preson, Mrs. Kellenberger. He knew
at the time she did not write them.
TJie witness had heard of a remark this
woman is alleged to have made to thÂ«
efect that it was a shame that after Mrs
Dunning left San Francisco her husband
tried to drink himself to death. He ac
knowledged that he knew no good will ex
isted between Mrs. Botkin and Mrs
Seeley, and that Mrs. Botkin tried to
brj ak the intimacy existing between Bev
erly and the woman. He also said he
knew Mr. Botkin lived with Mrs. Arbo
cast, as Mrs. Botkin hnd discussed it with
him. She also discussed fhe matter of a
dlvbrce, which She said Mr. Botkin desired
and which she did not propose to permit
As a reason she said she did not intend
to be left without support. The witness
said he did not encourage her either to
gel a divorce or to fight her husband in
the matter.
Asked as to why he associated with Mrs.
Botkin he said he enjoyed" her societyâ
enjoyed it more than that of any other
woman in San Francisco at that time.
The witness was asked what women he
associated with before Mrs. Botkin came
on the scene, and he said some he oid
not know. Roughly speaking there might
be half a dozen of them.
"Were you affectionate with them?"
asked Knight.
"Not particularly."
He met. them in the park, at the Cliff
ar.d at cafes. He wrote no notes to them
j and had no difficulty in breaking off with
I them.
"Give their names," said Knight.
I decline to answer," said the witness.
Judge Cookâ Answer the question
"1 will answer it when I have time to
figure it up. It is now nearly half-past
4 and the court will soon adjourn. I want
to think it over until morning."
Knightâ l insist upon an answer to my
Dunningâ l decline to answer.
Knightâ l insist. I submit to your Hon
or that the witness is in contempt of
court and that he must be confined in
the County Jail until he answers the
question.
Judge Cook then remanded the witness
to t^he custody of the Sheriff, saving-
You can have the night to think the
mfittrr over.
To Mr. Hosmer the witness said he did
not claim he did not remember, but want
ed time to think the matter over.
The trial will go on this morning. Dun
ning will be asked the question at which
he shied yesterday and if he does not
answer will probably be taken back to
jail and the examination of other wit
nesses will proceed.
JOSSELYN WAS NOT
AN ASSASSIN'S VICTIM
A PROBABILITY THAT HE COM
MITTED SUICIDE.
Peculiar Action of His Relatives,
Who Seek to Make It Appear
That Me Was Murdered.
Lockwood H. Josselyn, the young sol
dier who was found dead in the bathtub
at the home of his parents, 441 Geary
street, Sunday morning, was not the vic
tim of foul play, despite the intimation
of his relatives that he met death at the
hands of some assassin.
For some inexplicable reason they have
sought to uphold the theory that the
young man was murdered, but a careful
investigation by Detective Tom Gibson,
substantiated by the autopsy, disproves
this.
In the opinion of Gibson, Josselyn either
committed suicide or died from the ef
fect of alcohol, for, although the young
man's parents maintain that he never
touched liquor, it is known positively that
he was drinking heavily last Saturday
night. If Josselyn ended his life by
means of poison, an analysis of the sto
mach, which will be made to-day, will
undoubtedly disclose that fact, unless he
took some poison which leaves no trace
behind, for Josselyn was an expert In
poisons and would have had no difficulty
in choosing some means of death that
would not be disclosed by chemicals.
Josselyn, in company with L. M. Oak
ley, left the cineograph parlor on Mar
ket street, where both were employed, at
12:10 Sunday night. They went to the
Metropole saloon, a few doors from their
place of business, where they had two
drinks. From there they went to the
Olympic and had two drinks more. At 1
oelock they went to a restaurant on
Taylor street, where they had supper.
From there the couple proceeded to 2
Mason street and sat down to a game of
poker. During the game Josselyn had
three drinks of whisky and three drinks
of gin. He lost about $o, all that re
mained of $S 50 when he left the cine
ograph establishment. He was some
what under the influence of liquor, and
Oakley accompanied him to his home, 441
Geary street, leaving him at the door.
They arrived there at 4:15 a. m. On the
way home Josselyn remarked that he had
promised .to give his mother $ti 50, but
he didn't know where the money was
coming from.
It would have been utterly impossible
for anybody to have attacked Josselyn
and carried the body up the two flights
of stairs, or even to make his way up in
the dark unhampered by any "burden
whatever without arousing the entire
household unless he was thoroughly fa
miliar with the place.
Josselyn has been quite despondent of
late, and it is said that the sole object
of his visit here was to seek a reconcilia
tion with his divorced wife, but she re
fused to have anythng more to do with
him. A few years ago he was found by
his father In an unconscious condition in
a room at 520 Eddy street, where the
family then lived, from the effects of gas
which he had evidently turned on with
suicidal intent.
Sunday morning, soon after the body
was found, Mrs. Josselyn stated that
Lockwood had told her that some time
he would be found dead in the bathtub.
The family asserted that when they re
moved the body to his room and took his
clothing off they saw several suspicious
marks on his throat and a bruise on the
head as though he had received a violent
blow, but yesterday when Dr. Gallagher
held the autopsy he was unable to find
any of the marks described, and all the
organs were in a healthy condition, with
the possible exception of the stomach,
which will be tested to-day.
The youngest sister of the deceased. who
discovered the body, told the detective
yesterday that when she entered the
bathroom she noticed a peculiar smell.
Her stepmother sharply told her not to
say anything. From this and other cir
cumstances the officer thinks the family
are satisfied that the young man commit
ted suicide, but in order to escape the
odium are trying to make it appear that
he was murdered.
While in camp at Chickamaupa last
summer Josselyn had an attack of ty
phoid fever, and it is possible that in his
weakened condition the liquor he drank
Saturday night caused his death :<^ he
entered the bathroom, his body falling
into the tub.
SUPERVISORS TURNED
THE MAYOR DOWN
THEY REFUSED TO INDORSE
HIS SELECTION.
Another Extension of Time Granted
to the Hall of Justice Con
tractors.
The chief feature of the meeting of the
Board of Supervisors yesterday afternoon
was a knock-out blow straight from the
6houlder to Mayor Phelan from the en
tire bodyâ the solid contingent and the
minority joining hands to show him that
the old committee of one hundred's deeds
live after it.
The retiring Mayor always places in
nomination a gas inspector for the ensu
ing two years. Yesterday afternoon,
shortly after calling the meeting to or
der, Mayor Phelan named John P. Dunn
as the man he would prefer to see en
joying this soft snap. There was a brief
pause. The members oi the board leaned
back in their chairs in a reflective mood
and memory carried them back to the
days when John P. Dunn presided over
what has frequently Deen termed "the
one hundred job chasers." Supervisor
Smith broke the silence. "I move that
the matter be laid over for one week "
he said. "Why do you want it laid over?"
asked Clinton. "To beat John P. Dunn
if possible," was the retort. When the
roll was called it showed that the ma
jority of the board was in favor of -lav
ing over to beat John P. Dunn." And the
Mayor sighed deeply.
The next pretty little thing that popped
its head into the nest of jobbery was a
communication from iiateman Brothers
requesting a further extension of time
on the Hall of Justice. The last time
such a request was made they were given
untitl January 1, 1899, to finish the build
ing, although every one was confident
that it could not possibly be made ready
for occupancy by that time. There was
the. usual talk, the usual cry of "altera
tions in the plans," and the lucky con
tractors were given until July 19. This
is good news for the spiders that have
made their nests undisturbed in the cor
ridors of the building, but the property
owners may look at it in another light
Another problem came up among a
batch of bills. It consisted of bills from
Henley & Costello and McGowan &
Squires for $475 each for legal services
Inquiry elicited the information that these
services consisted of defending Supervis
ors Lackmann and Rottanzi in the suit
which followed ousting the board from
office about a year ago. Some of the
members of the board objected to the
payment of these bins on tho ground that
they were personal bills, but they will
be paid just the same.
Supervisor Clinton sprung a ne\Â» scheme
the object of Which is to provide for a
Mission zoo at a. very small cost to the
ci.ty. He stated that the Branch county
Jail is nothing more or less than a com
fortable summer resort for a horde of
criminals; that, when the Hall of Jus
tice is completed, the portion of ie City
Hall now used for police headquarters
and the City Prison will be vacated. His
plan Is to move the inmates of the branch
jail into the City Hall and use the House
of Refuge property as a Mission zoo. The
resolution was passed to print and wnl
be taken up next week.
Children's Lyceum.
The Children's Progressive Lyceum will
hold its twenty-seventh annual Christmas
festival on Monday evening, December
2fi. at Pythian Castle, 909 Market street.
The programme will consist of the oper
etta in one act entitled "Under the Green
wood Tree." and a piece "The Christmas
Ship," in which seven persons, including
Santa Claus, will take part. There will
also be recitations, vocal and instru
mental music and a distribution of gifts,
the whole to conclude with dancing.

time is close at hand, and while the
necessity for relief is not actually pres
ent except in a few cases the direful
day is not more than a week or two
off. The few cars of provisions and
feed that have been distributed have
been timely and have prevented some
suffering, but in order that the entire
community may be tided over a bad
time it will require the expenditure of
at least $150,000.
On going over the country the evi
dences of distress are not present ex
cept in the absence of live stock and
the barren fields. The people are not
flaunting their destitution before the
world. Rather, are they hiding it, but
when you go into their houses and see
the scant larders and the pinched faces
of. the women and children you realize
that you are in the presence of want,
and terrible want.
I talked to Dr. Galbraith, a man of
wide acquaintance, who has responded
faithfully to every call made upon his
services, notwithstanding the fact that
he has not received a fee in two years.
He was loath to tell of the distress of j
his neighbors, but gave stories of many
who were in sore straits, yet are too
proud to have it made public. He told I
of one boy whom he treated and found
that the malady arose from the fact
that the child's food had consisted prin- |
cipally of acorns. He told of families 1
where there had been nothing but flour
or meal and beans for weeks. No
grease of any kind and no meat. These
are the stories that were told wherever
I went and yet they were impossible
of actual verification, for when the
houses of the unfortunates were visited
they would hide their misery and put
forth an assumption of comfort that
was only too strangely belied by their
gaunt features and starved look.
I saw but two dead cows and one
dead horse during the day's ride. The
stock has been sent out of the country
except on the large ranches. There it
is reported that great numbers have
died. The few horses and cows neces
sary for ordinary farm purposes are al
most walking skeletons, and unless
they get food soon they will all die.
A few tons of hay to each farmer will
save his stock, and $50 worth of pro
visions will save his family. If rains
come this will be sufficient. If an
other dry season is upon them they
will have to be carried for more than
a year.
When it was announced that Claus
Spreckels had sent his check to Gov
ernor Budd for $25,000 to be distributed
to the needy in this county, the uni- j
versal reply was that Mr. Spreckels j
was one man on whom the people could
always rely, and there has been a gen
eral expression of satisfaction and
gratification that the money has been
placed in the hands of the Governor
rather than being distributed, as some
has been, in a May that will advertise
the misfortune of the people in a the
atrical manner to display with ostenta
tion the liberality of the donor.
As one man expressed It, "God bless :
Claus Spreckels. He always knows
how to help the unfortunate."
The theatrical display of ' a news
paper has brought forth nothing hut
expressions of dissatisfaction, as the
people do not want their misfortunes
used to advertise yellow journalism.
CLAUS SPRECKELS'
ACTION IS TIMELY
Farmers Will Accept Help
on Condition of Being Al
lowed to Return Money.
SALINAS, Dec. 19.â News published
in the San Francisco dailies of the fact
that destitution existed in the southern
portion of Monterey and adjoining
county has created intense excitement
among all classes. Many who were
fully cognizant of the true facts con
tinue to belittle the information and
claim that the publication of details
would only serve to give the county a
black eye and stop all progress. While
they acknowledge that many deserving
people are in need they also say many
who are always grumbling even in the
best years, will receive aid which
should not be given. That feed for
stock, food for families and also cloth
ing are wanted, is not denied.
Further excitement was found to ex
ist, however, when rumors began to
spread that Claus Spreckels, believing
the truth of reports sent by corre
spondents and private letters, had of
fered Governor Budd the sum of $50,000
to be used as State aid for the destitute
and suffering of Monterey County.
When the report came direct, however,
that Claus Spreckels had offered 550,000
to Governor Budd for relief of the suf
fering" people of Monterey County, of
which sum $25,000 had been accepted,
there was great satisfaction. "It is one'
of the grandest and noblest gifts ever
given for suffering humanity by any
one," was the general outspoken opin
ion of every one who was shown the
news, and none could praise Cla,us
Spreckels too much. The gift will, if
used properly, do much to alleviate dis
tress during the long period between
the present date and the crop season
of 1899.
Bankers, merchants, physicians and
all the more prominent citizens seemed
relieved by the news of the donation
and many stated that numbers of those
who will be relieved will accept help
only on the condition that they will be
allowed to return money when better
times come. All except a few croakers,
who seek to decry the existing want,
declare that the gift comes in the nick
of time and all say God bless Claus
Spreckels, who, believing that suffer
ing exists, extends a glad hand to all
and makes Christmas time possibly
a merry one.
NEW YORK SOLDIER ,
BOYS START EASTWARD
Four companies of the First New York
Volunteer Infantry, constituting Major
Walter Scott's battalion, started for home
yesterday, happy in the prospect of spend
ing Christmas with their families, from
whom they have been separated almost
ever since they were mustered into the
Federal service, last May. The returning
soldiers are members of Companies C of
Albany, E of Utica, F of Walton and G
of Oneonta, N. V., and they will reach
their homes on Christmas evening or
Christmas day, barring accident. The
only cloud that mars the joy of their re
turn is the fact that since leaving the
East deaths have averaged three to a
company. In addition a number of sick
were left behind in Honolulu, afflicted
with typhoid fever.
The mustering out of the Utah Cavalry
is proceeding rapidly and they will' de
part for Salt Lake Friday.

WHAT PRIESTS HAVE
DONE IN PHILIPPINES
NEW YORK, Dec. 19.â Archbishop
Ireland of St. Paul was seen at the
Holland House, where he has been
stepping during his stay in New York. â 
and said regarding the attitude of the
Roman Catholic church in the Philip
pines:
"Who in America knows anything about !
the Philippines? The church in the Phil- \
ippines will. I have no doubt, accustom
' itself to the conditions under the new
| regime, as it did under the old. The church
I will accept the conditions that are to be, ;
I just as it accepts them in this country.
! All the civilization that the Philippines
i have has beÂ« n received from the priests.
! They are the representatives of social
i and civil order in the islands. The people i
; were taught tiy the priests and they were
! taught too much. The priests will uphold
this Government as they upheld the Gov
ernment <>f Spain. That is, as the repre
i sentatives of order, they will uphold the
existing Government. This Government '
] will have to depend upon the priests to a ,
! large extent for their moral influence in ,
! law and order.
j This Government will do well not to an- ;
tagonize the priests. And I will say I
know it is not the policy of the Govern- I
ment to antagonize them, nor is there I
any disposition to do so in any quarter.
The Archbishop was asked if the our- I
poses of his visit to Washington had
been to discuss this matter with the
President. He said:
I saw the President, but I cannot say
what the subject of conversation was.
There Is no truth in the published report j
j that the Archbishop of Manila has issued
! a circular of an unfavorable character
against the United States. Agulnaldo is |
jealous of the power of the priests and i
wants to rule absolutely himself. The
| conduct of the priests will depend entirely
upon the policy of the United States in
j the Philippines and that I have no doubt
will be the same as in this country.

SOLUTION OF THE
CRISIS IS DELAYED
MADRID. Dec. 19.â T0-day's Cabinet
Council was adjourned owing to Senor
Sagasta's indisposition and the solu
j tion of the crisis is therefore delayed.
i The Ministerial Correo publishes this
from Santiago de Cuba: "A group of
insurgents, commanded by Calixto Gar
cia's son, made their appearance in the
town. The American Governor wish
ed them to disarm, but they refused
and invaded the Spanish Casino,
smashing the furniture."
Senor Montero Rios had a long con
ference this afternoon with Duke Al
modovar de Rio. Minister of Foreign
Affairs, to whom he handed the peace
treaty documents.
Lieutenant General Marin, captain
general of Madrid, is about to issue a
proclamation closing all the Carlist
clubs in the district and it is expected
that he will also order the suspension
of all Carlist newspapers.
MARSHAL BLANCO
ARRIVES IN SPAIN
ALICANTE, Spain, Dec. 19.â The
Spanish mail steamer Villaverde with
j Marshal Ramon Blanco, formerly Cap
i tain General of Cuba; Generals Fernal
and Tejega, Colonels Cevalos, Pagliery,
Tusser and Domenigo and several
others of lesser rank arrived here this
: afternoon from Havana. Marshal
Blanco landed without incident and
evading the crowd which was waiting
for him took the train for Madrid atter
sending to the Queen Regent a tele
gram of devotion and receiving from
Sagasta one of welcome. He declined
to discuss the Cuban question, but ap
peared greatly affected.
CUBANS THREATEN
TO LYNCH OFFICIALS
HAVANA, Dec. 19.â Crowds of people
of the lower class at Correo, the evacu
ated suburb of Havana, Invaded the
residence of an ex-police official named
Prim, with the intention of lynching
him. Prim escaped through the rear
of the house. Other officials were also
threatened with lynching. At Pueblo
Neuvo and other places last night un
known persons fired several shots at
the Spanish sentinels.
Cuban forces have entered the evacu
ated town of Calabazar and Santiago
de las Vegas, this province, and have
hoisted the Cuban flag.
REFUSES TO COUNT
THE SOLDIERS' VOTE
CARSON', Dec. 19.â The Supreme Court
met as a Board of Canvassers this after
noon and refused to count the vote of the
Nevada Battalion, now at Manila. In sup
port of the count Republicans urged that
the constitution granted the right of suf
frage to soldiers when absent, and that
the election ordinance of tjie constitution
provided how the votes should be taken
and returned until the Legislature should
provide better moans. In 1866 the Legis
lature provided this means. This a<i waa
repealed In IS7:{. but attorneys contended
that the concluding section of the con
stitution revived the means as provided
in the election ordinance of the constitu
! â¢ The board denied the request on the
I ground that it had no jurisdiction, and
I if any board should canvass the returns
i it should be a board under the election
I ordinance. The board then proceeded to
I canvass the State vote, which resulted in
I the election of the whole silver ticket,
with the exception of the superintendent
of Instruction. Cutting. In the Gover
nor's vote no changes were discovered.
and Sadler is elected Governor by 22
votes.
The action taken by the Republican
attorneys is preliminary to the steps of
William McMillan in his contest of Sau
ler's electtion as Governor.

OPPOSITION TO
THE JUNKET
OF SENATORS
Their Visit to Cuba
Unnecessary.
PLATT TALKS FOR EXPANSION
SAYS THE UNITED STATES CAN
ACQUIRE TERRITORY.
Motion to Postpone Consideration of
the Nicaragua Bill Causes
an Interesting
Debate.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 19.â The Senate
I had a busy day and there were several
important speeches. Platt of Connecti
cut spoke against the Vest resolution,
which declares that the United States
j has no power to acquire territory. He
I said that the power of a nation to ac
qutre territory was as inherent as its
sovereignty. The United States had
the right to govern such territory in
the best possible manner until the peo
i pie of the acquired lands were capable
' of self-government
Proctor of Vermont and Hale of
[ Maine explained divergent views upon
1 the committee of Senators to visit
Cuba. Proctor thought such a com
mittee was necessary, while Hale
thought it would be in extremely bad
; taste and useless.
The Nicaragua canal bill was up dur
' ing last part of the day, and Senators
i Berry, Allen, Hoar, Caffery and Mor
|gan discussed the measure.
I Lodge of Massachusetts, from the For
eign Relations Committee, favorably re
ported the following resolution and asked
tor its immediate consideration:
"That the President be and is hereby
required to give to Congress so far as the
Bame may be done without detriment to
public interests, all the information in
1 his possession concerning certain alleged
outrages committed on the person of
] Bishop Earl Cranston and other citizens
I in the city of I.-king China, by subjects
I of the Emperor of china, and what steps,
IJf any, have been taken by the State
Department in the matter of requesting
suitable indemnity therefore."
The resolution was agreed to.
Platt's speech was a constitutional ar
gument, maintaining the legal right of
the United States to acquire territory.
Baying he <H<l not propose to discuss t lie
policy of expansion nor the features of
the government we might establish in any
foreign territory we might acquire. Ex
pansion, he said, has been a law of our
national growth, the mainspring of our
national development.
I Gallinger, from the Committee on Gen
; ernl Expenses, attempted to report the
resolution introduced by Proctor provid
ing for the appointment of a select com
â  mittee of the Senate to visit Cuba and
â  report upon the conditions prevailing
I there.
The effort on Gallinger's part developed
stern resistance from Hale, and was the
j occasion of a short explanation from
; Proctor.
The Senate took up the Nicaraguan ca
nal bill, and Berry of Arkansas spoke
upon his amendments to the measure, xie
announced preliminarily that on general
! principles he was favorable to the con
: structlon of a canal across the isthmus,
j and he had been so for many years be
fore he felt that such an enterprise
would promote the interests of the South
; crn States, but always contended for
: its construction by the Government of
! the I'nlted States. He had been honeful
' on this account that it mijjht be possible
to eliminate the Maritime l anal Company
i from the question entirely. He had voted
; against the company's charter In 1887,
! Still, said he. Morgan insists that this
! accomplishment is out of the question at
present. If this be true, the Question
now was whether the work of construct
ing the canal should proceed under tiie
name of the Maritime Canal Company or
be suspended entirely. In this connection
he also took into consideration the ad
: ditional fact that another company would
secure concessions from Nicaragua, to
take off.-ct immediately upon the expira
, tion nf the Maritime Company's grant,
hence It seemed difficult to get away from
corporation interests, but he hoped that
before the final vote all corporate inter
ests would be eliminated, and in view of
this fact be had considered it desirable,
if not incumbent upon the Senate, to
i make the pending bill as perfect as it
could be made, and it was to this end
that his amendment had been made. He
, did not commit himself to vote for the
bill, even if his amendments were adopt
ed,'but would determine that question
when a vote was reached.
Berry then explained the provisions of
his amendments.
Allen of Nebraska followed Berry. He
was not opposed to the canal scheme, he
said, because he antagonized certain fea
j tures of the bill. One of its most per- I
nicious features would be eliminated by
the adoption of the Berry amendments,
namely, the bond feature. He was op
posed "to the provision for the adjustment
of the claims of the Maritime Canal Com
pany. He wanted the Government pro
tected from all loss and all possible fraud
and peculation by that company.
Caffery of Louisiana, at the request of
i Turner, who was; unavoidably absent,
read the latter's motion to postpone the
consideration of the bill until January 10.
Hoar said he thought the canal should
be built and at once. While Senators
did not know what the canal would cost.
they knew enough to know that its con
struction was necessary for the protec
tion of the commercial relations between
the coasts nf the United States. The ca
nal, he insisted, should be built by the
Government.
Morgan maintained that the concession
of Nicaragua and Costa Rica was not
forfeitable next October. Morgan said
that the Berry amendments for financing
the enterprise were more acceptable to
him than the provision of the committee.
He predicted that the United States
would secure at least 5 per cent divi
dends upon its investment, and drew a
glowing picture of the use to which the
funds could be put.
At 5:15 P- m. the Senate went into ex
ecutive session, and at 5:30 p. m. ad
journed.
AN APPROPRIATION FOR THE
PHILADELPHIA EXPOSITION
WASHINGTON, Dec. 19.â This was sus
pension day in the House and several bills
were passed, the most important of which
was the bill appropriating $350,000 for the
Philadelphia Exposition of ISS9. The vote
was exceedingly close, it having but two
I votes more than the necessary two-thirds.
Bills were also passed under the suspen
sion of the rules to authorize the distribu
tion of the assets of the Freedmen's
Bank; to enlarge the scope of the Fish
Commission to include game birds; for the
relief of the Fourth Mounted Arkansas
Infantry, and for the relief of John W.
Lewis of Oregon.
Bailey of Texas introduced a resolution
in open House directing the Judiciary
Committee to investigate and report on
the question as to whether the members
of the House who had accepted commis
sions in the army had forfeited their
seats in the House. He made the resolu
tion the text for some remarks, in the
course of which he took occasion to bit
terly denounce a newspaper statement to
the effect that in his attitude on this ques
tion he had been made a catspaw by
prominent Republicans in the House. He
denounced the Republican who had insti
gated the statement as an infamous liar
and challenged him to father it. There
was no reply to Baileys statement and
the resolution was referred to the Com
mittee on Rules.

PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 19.â District
Attorney Graham to-day filed In the
prothonotary's office of the Supreme
Court the answer of the commonwealth
to the petition of United States Sen
ator M. S. Quay, his son. Richard R.
Quay, and f..v. - â â¢ State Treasurer Hay
wood, In which the defendants asked
the Supreme Court for a rule to show
cause why a writ of certiorarl should
not be issued to take up the record of
examination of the case, in which three
defendants are charged with con
spiracy to misuse State funds on de
posit in the People's Bank.
True bills of indictment were re
turned by the Grand Jury against the
defendants and their trial was fixed
for Monday, December 12, but on De
cember 10 Justices Green and Williams
of the Supreme Court granted the rule
asked for by the defendants and fixed
January 1 as the time for hearing the
argument.
The District Attorney says that the
statement that the defendants could i
not obtain a fair trial is "scandalous
and untruthful and a gross Imputation
upon the twelve Judges of the Phila
delphia courts," and he declares it to
be untrue, as charged in the petition,
that the pnrsecutions were Inspired by
Judge James Jay Gordon, as alleged.
Continuing, the answer says:
The evidence shows that public funds of
the commonwealth of Pennsylvania for
years have been used by the conspirators
for their private and unlawful gain. In
tereat has been allowed by the People's
Bank on deposits of money and paid to
the accused in their bank account and
checked nut by them along with their own
moneys in the same account. In other in
stances cashiers' checks and drafts have
been made payable to the accused for cer
tain sums of interest on the public money
and these documents, bearing the indorse
ment of the accused, showing the receipt
by them of the interest money paid, are
in existence and in possession of the com
j monwealth. The books show that hun
! dreds of thousands of dollars of public
! money deposited in the People's Bank
were set apart for the use of M. S. Quay
and used by him, and that he was charged
no interest thereon. The book showed
that hundreds of thousands of dollars' |
worth of stock were bought for M. S.
Quay with the money; that whenever he
failed to use his full allowance of public
money thus set apart for him interest was
carefully calculated upon the balance not
used by him in the purchase of stocks
and paid to the State Treasurer.
The District Attorney declares that
these proceedings were instituted be
fore' Mr. Quay made the personal an
nouncement of his candidacy to suc
ceed himself in the United States Sen
ate. Why a legal proceeding should
be arrested upon the ground of a de
fendant's candidacy for office, the Dis
trict Attorney is at a loss to under
stand, and all allegations to this effect,
he says, are irrelevant and immaterial.
The District Attorfiey avers that in
seeking trial for these cases he is do
ing simply his duty under his oath of
â¢ â¢fflee and that in so doing he is not
prejudicing and intimidating the Gen
eral Assembly. The prosecution, he
says, was based upon "incriminating
evidence," a part of which was pro
cured before the committing magis
trate and before the Grand Jury, and
the prosecution "has no other purpose
than that of bringing to justice per
sons whom the respondent believes have
persistently violated the laws of the
commonwealth, and used the public
moneys of the State as though they
were part of their own private prop
erty."
In closing the answer the District At
torney says:
Respondent avers that appeals of the
extraordinary nature of the one in the
petition in question, where rules are
granted accompanied with stay of pro
ceedings that interrupt large and orderly
progress of the administration of justice
in the lower courts, are calculated to do
irreparable injury and to make it impos
sible to successfully prosecute persons of
wealth and power.

SAX QUENTIN PRISON. Dec. 19.â
For months Parole Clerk F. \V. Rey
nolds of San Quentin has been en
gaged in selling tobacco to the con
victs, and it was only when the mat
ter was brought to the attention of
Prison Director James li. Wilkins that
a searching Investigation by him dis
covered the fact that Reynolds was
trafficking with the prisoners by con
sent of Warden Hair. The tacts in the
case will be laid before the board of
directors at its next meeting.
Director Wilkins, whose duty it is
as resilient din ctor to take special cog
nizance of Buch affairs, demanded why
the practice was permitted in violation
of the rules laid down by the Board
of Prison Directors, and even by the
Warden himself, and received the re
ply that as the amount of tobacco al
lowed the prisoners by the State was
inadequate for their needs, the Warden
had thought it best to permit it to be
sold to them in order to prevent us
being smuggled through the Kates.' As,
it is against prison rules for the pris
oners i" be m possession of any money,
this excuse failed to satisfy the in
dignant director, and he immediately
unced his Intention of bringing
the matt' r up at the next meeting of
the Prise n Board. The Importance of
the affair and the momentous conse
quences that may follow from an in
vestigation of this character can only
be Burmlsed.
Prior to the great strike in the jute
mill two years ago every prisoner was
allowed weekly a pound of tobacco,
either for Bmoking or chewing, or a
convict might take half of one kind'
and half ol the other, as suited him
best. During the strike it was found
that th-- force of guards on duty was
totally inadequate to cope with the dif
ficulties of such a condition and more
guards had to be placed on duty. In
order to save the Stale the expense of
hiring these additional guards, the t
prisoners had their weekly supply of
Unfinished, and since then
have been allowed only one-sixth of a
pound weekly. This plan had the ef
teet also of punishing them for their
unruly behavior.
The tobacco is distributed every Sat
urday and lasts the average user only
Until the succeeding .Monday or Tues
day. Consequently they were Bupposed
to do without the weed for the remain
der of the week unless they managed
to smuggle it in small quantities
through tl "Supposed" is said 1
advisedly, for it is now known that !
(or seveutl months such of the prison- j
ers as could afford it have purchased
all they wished to use from Parole 1
Clerk Reynolds, who Is also the War- i
den's stenographer. .Most of Reynolds' j
supply was bought in San Rafael at
the stores of < '. Grosjean and .L. L,a- \
\ |{ 'Sa.
'â¢lie of the most rigid rules of the I
prison is that not only shall no convict
Emitted to have any money in his i
ssii n, but that no person shall be
allowed to sell or give them anything. '
When Director \Vilkins learned a few
days ago that Reynolds was selling i
tobacco to the prisoners he suspected
that in this manner a good deal of the |
opium used by the inmates had found
Its way inside the walls. He laid a plan [
to catch Reynolds in the act, and, being |
aware that Warden Hale must co-oper- i
ate in such a proceeding, sent for him [
to come to San Rafael. The Warden
met Wilkins and dumfounded the Di
rector by admitting that the parole j
flerk was selling tobacco with his
knowledge and consent
If Warden Hale knew tobacco was !
b-^ing sold prisoners he also knew that ''
they had money, itself a contraband ''
article. His failure to consult with the i
Board oil Directors before permitting
ho Important an infraction of the rules 1
is peculiar. Director Wilkins asserted I
at the close of the consultation that the ;
matter would have to be brought up
before the board at the January meet- i
Ing.
"I am exceedingly sorry that this has !
reached the public," said Director 1
Wilkins this evening, "as the printing
of such things never fails to have a I
tendency to cast reproach on prison af- !
lairs, whether or not anything comes
of it. It is true that Warden Hale and I
myself disagree on the advisability of
permitting anybody to sell to the con
victs tobacco, but the discussion be
tween us was perfectly friendly. of j
course, as it is contrary to prison reg- I
illations. I shall he obliged to call it t-i
the attention of the board at the next '
tweeting, but I hope that the tangle can!
b e straightened out satisfactorily to
all."

GRIP EPIDEMIC
AT THE EAST
New York Physicians
Are Kept Busy.
TALK OF RADICAL TREATMENT
HEALTH BOARD ASKED TO ISO
LATE THE PATIENTS.
Dr. Crosby Declares It Is an Infec
tious and Contagious Disease,
and Should Be Treated
as Such.
Social Pis-patch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Dec. 19.â Grip is epi
demic in town. The deaths are few â
one or two a day â but the physicians
have their hands full.
The Health Board informally dis
cussed the epidemic this morning. Dr.
John B. Crosby favors amending the j
sanitary code by including influenza, or !
grip, with consumption, diphtheria, yel
low fever, cholera and other diseases
classed as "infectious and contagious. "
making it mandatory that physicians
report cases of grip to the board. Dr.
William T. Jenkins, while not deriving
that grip is infectious and contatrious. !
was not in favor of officially including!
it among reportable diseases. The board j
deferred action, after listening to the
arguments.
"Influenza is an infectious and con
tagious disease, due to influenza bacil
lus," said Dr. Crosby. "In cases of in
fluenza or grip organisms are present in
all secretions of the nose, throat and
bronchial tubes. The disease is trans
mitted from person to person through
taking in these organisms, either from
direct contact or after secretions have j
been dried and pulverized and inhaled
In the form of dust. The disease cannot j
be produced by any other causes than j
influenza bacillus. There are many '
catarrhal affections of the respiratory
tract Improperly called grip, and the !
distinction between th^se and the true
grip is extremely difficult and often
impossible in milder forms. The srrip.
however, is a more serious affection,
produces greater depression and is fol
lowed by more tedious convalescence.
The disease extends rapidly and affects j
large numbers of people because of
lack of a definite diagnosis, and no at
tempt at isolation of the patient or dis
infection of the discharges.
"Failure to isolate on the part of
those responsible for the health of a j
great community is a crime, and should
great loss result from this carelessness
the Health Board cannot escape public
censure."
NEW HAVEN, Dec. 19.â 1t is esti
mated that 400 Yale students and fifty
professors have the grip. Only severe
cases are being treated at the college
Infirmary, which is filled with patients.
The epidemic has played havoc in col
lege, for this is the fortnight of "semi
annuals," and grip sufferers will be
seriously handicapped in their studies
by failure to be present at examina
tions. There are several thousand casos
uf grip in the city, including thirty
physicians.

NEW YORK, D^:. 19.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald |
telegraphs: Secretary Long, Acting
Secretary Allen and Captain Crownin
shield, chief of the Bureau of Naviga
tion, have been giving a great deal of
attention to the number and character
of the ships to be distributed among
the North Atlantic, European and
South' Atlantic stations. It is desired
to retain a strong force on the home
station and to send a respectable naval I
force to Europe, but the ships avail- j
able in view of the strengthening: of
liear Admiral Dewey's command aru
very few.
The only armorclads under the com- '
mand of Rear Admiral Sampson are I
the battleships Indiana, Massachusetts
and Texas, and the cruisers Brooklyn
and New York. Only four protected
cruisers are in commission on the North
Atlantic coastâ th# Chicago, Cincin
nati, Newark and New Orleans. The |
New Orleans will be placed out of com- |
mission to receive sieveral improve- !
ments, and the smokestack of the New- !
ark is to be lengthened. The Cincin- !
nati, upon arrival at New York, will !
also be placed out of commission.
It is expected that the cruiser At
lanta will be commissioned next month.
The Newark will probably be sent to
the South Altantic as the flagship of
that station, and she will be reinforced !
by the Wilmington and Castine.
Most of the gunboats which are be
ing prepared at the navy yards will
be required for service in Cuban and i
Porto Hicnn waters, and these will be i
attached to the North Atlantic squad
ron.
What ships will comprise the Euro
pean squadron cannot be indicated
now, but it is generally believed that!
the Brooklyn will be the flagship and I
xho Chicago and one of the battleships, j
perhaps the Texas, may be assigned to
it.
It is the understanding at the Navy
Department that no attempt will be
made by the friends of the naval per
sonnel bill in the House to brine the
measure up for consideration until af
ter the holidays. Speaker Reed has
promised ho will then set asidf a day
for its discussion, and Senator Hale has
promised that favorable action by the
House will lead him to do what ho can
to facilitate action hy the Senate.
MACKENZIE DEPRIVED
OF HIS SINECURE
SAN JOSE, Dec. 19.-The Board of Su
pervisors to-day abolished the office of
! Fish and Game Warden, which for the
past three years hasfbeen filled by John
D. Mackenzie, a lieutenant of "ex-Boss"
Rea. The place was simply a sinecure.
Mackenzie's salary was $75 per month,
With an allowance of $25 a month for ex
penaea This latter sum was always
drawn to the limit. For the past year
large numbers of taxpayers have gone to
' the different Supervisors and demanded
that the Game Wardenship he discontin
ued, but without avail. The victory of
the Republican Good Government League
[ at the last election changed the situation
( The Supervisors were given to understand
.that the Mackenzie soft snap- must cease
or suit would be brought. To-day Super
| visor Roll introduced the following reso
, lution:
"Resolved, That It is the sense of the
Board of Supervisors that no appointment
be made to fill the office of Fish and
| Game Warden of this county as no ade
quate reason exists that renders such an
office a public necessity; the result of
labors of such office having demonstrated
the fact that no compensatory advan
tages have been shown to have resulted
therefrom, and it is, therefore, inexpedi
ent to incur the expense to the county
attendant upon the' appointment of such
an officer." '
The Supervisors looked at one another
1 in amazement, but none seconded Roll's
motion to. adopt the resolution. Roll
then moved that the office of Game War
den be abolished. Ayer seconded it, and
Stein voted with them. The rays . were
P. P. Austin and G. E. Rea.
Fen Massol, a clerk employed by the
board, was ordered dismissed at the end
of the month, and H. S. Foote, another
clerk, was given until April 1 to complete
some work he was employed on.
It is said the abolishment of the office
of county stenographer is contemplated.

PRESIDENT AND
CONFEDERATES
Men in Gray Honor Their
Former Foe.
LOVING WORDS OF WELCOME
THE PRESIDENT HAS WON ALL
HEARTS IN THE SOUTH.
Veterans Decorate the Chief Execu

Compel Him to
Wear It.
Ececlal Dispatch to The Call.
MACON, Ga., Dec. 19.â The President
and his party were received here by
the largest cro\ d which has gathered
in Macon since the last visit of Jeffer-
B&n Davis to this city. Drawn up in
front of the station was the Bibb Coun
ty Camp of the Confederate Survivors'
Association, 400 strong, headed by
Commander C. M. Wiley. As the Presi
dent reached the old Confederates he
was hailed by Colonel Wiley, who, in
Welcoming the visitors, said:
Wo extend to you and your party a
most generous, hearty and sincere wel
come to our beloved city. You, sir, have
endeared yourself to the hearts of all
Confederate soldiers on account of the
noble sentiments expressed by you In re
gard to our Confederate dead. 1 assure
you that these old, maimed and Infirm
veterans who have met hero to do you
honor to-day appreciate such words of
love and kindness, and, tittered, too, by
the President of this great country, and
by one. who was a member of the Union
army In the sixties, i hope and pray,
Mr. President, that God in his infinite
mercy may so direct the future legislation
of this country thut the living Confeder
ates will be remembered. This country
and the stars and stripes belong as much
to the Confederate veterans as they do
to the Grand Army of the Republic. The
South proved its loyalty to this grand
obi country when war was declared with
Spain, and now henceforth and forever 1
i she will be found ready to take up arms
to defend our country and our flag.
Mr. president, on behalf of the brave
| and maimed Confederate soldiers of Biub
County, Georgia, 1 present to you thU
j parchment engrossed in letters of gold,
I the beautiful sentiment expressed by you
I in our capital city in regard to our hon
ored dead.
As the President was about to pro
ceed Dr. Roland B. Hall, another vet-
I eran, addressed him as follows:
Mr. President: In behalf of our noble
dead, and as Confederate veterans, we
are here to manifest our appreciation of
the noble and gtuierous sentiment you
have recently uttered. Do us the honur,
sir, to accept and wear this badge of a
Confederate veterans' association, which
bears your likeness and the words which
should endear you to the Heart of every
Confederate.
"I do not know that it would be
proper," said the President.
"But you must," said Dr. Hall, and
without further ceremony the President
marched ahead with Judge Speer. The
sight of the Confederate badge on the
President's coat as he passed through
the lines of veterans called forth vocif
erous cheering. The President wore the
badge during his stay in Macon.
One of General Wheeler's old cavalry
men also pinned a badge to the lapel
of his major general's coat and the
| doughty little warrior proudly wore it
j away with him when he left the city.
The Presidential party was driven in
carriages to the stand where the Presi
dent was to review the troops of Gen
eral Bates' division of General Wilson's
', army corps. As his carriage passed the
Confederate monument an old Confed
erate veteran frantically waved a Con
; federate Mag, while by his side was the
son of the colonel of one of Georgia's
hardest lighting Confederate regiments,
who was as vigorously waving ths
Stars and Stripes. When the President
was abreast of him the two flags were
I brought to a salute, side by side. The
' incident seemed to appeal to the Presi
j dent. Emblazoned on the base of the
' monument were the words of the Presi
dent about the graves of the Confed
erate dead.
After the review a great crowd gath
ered about the stand, though a steady
rain was falling. Judge Emory Speer
j introduced the President, who delivered
i a short address.
The President's remarks were fre
quently interrupted by cheÂ«rs. Then
there were loud calls for General
j Wheeler, "Little Old Fighting Joe,"
as he was affectionately called. He re
sponded briefly.
General Shatter was next called and
spoke briefly.
The Presidential party was taken In
\ charge by the committee and driven
i about the city until it was time to take
! their departure for Augusta.
TO PROMOTE COMMERCE
AND INCREASE TRADE
Some Very Important Provisions Are
Made in the Hannan-Payne
Bill.
WASHINGTON, T>ec. 19.â The Hannan-
Payne bill us it will be reported to Con
gress is entitled "A bill to promote the
commerce and Increase the foreign trade
of the United States and to provide auxil
iary cruisers, transports and seamen for
Government use when necessary."
The first section provides a graduated
plan of compensation for all vessels in
foreign commerce flying the American
flag, from the slowest sailing vessel to
the steamships of 10,000 tons burden, cap
able of making twenty-three knots an
hour and upward.
Section 2 provides that at least one
fourih of the navigating crew must be
citisena of the United States. Section 3
provides Ipr speed tests. Section 4 pro
vides a bounty of $2 per ton for all vessels
engaged in the deep sea fisheries, requir
ing that at least one-third of the crew
be citizens of the I'nlted States.
Section 5 provides that a bounty of $1
per month be paid each oallor actually
engaged in the deep sea fisheries. Sec
tion 6 provides safeguards ror payments.
Sections 7. 8, 9 and 10 make a general pro
vision .similar to the Act of 1898, under
which the New York and Paris were ad
mit t*d to register and the St. Louis and
St. Paul were built, and may be extended
to all similar vessels owned by American
citizens.
Section 11 requires that a certain num
ber nf American boy apprentices shall be
carried on each American vessel and
taught the art of navigation. Section 12
provides that in time of war all vessels
under this act may be taken by the Gov
ernment and used as cruisers, transports,
etc.
Section 13 prevents all vessels bulit
under this act from participation in the
coast trade or fishing. Section 14 provides
that all vessels registered under the act
shall carry mails, if required, without
other compensation than that provided in
the act. It also provides for the cancella
tion of the present mail 1 contracts with
the American lines.
The bill, it is explained, provides the
same general system adopted in building
up the German, British and other foreign
lines. All of the foreign countries en
gaged in commerce, the proposers of the
bill state, maintain their lines by a sys
tem of compensation to a greater or less
extent; some of them extending the
system, as does this bill, to all merchant
marine registered under their flag.
Hawaiian Bill Considered.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 19.â The Hawaii
an bill was further considered by the
House sub-Committee on Territories, and
â¢progress was madÂ© which takes the com
mlttee up to section 15. The changes thus
far made have been largely in the way
of verbal amendments, and It is said that
nothing in the nature of a vital change
has occurred. As yet, however, the com
mittee has not passed upon the sections
relating to the qualifications of voters for
Representatives and Senators, and those
are expected to develop the widest dif
ferences.
AGNEWS BOARD DROPS
THE BAILEY AFFAIR
Decide Against an Investigation of
the Death of the Young
Woman.
SAN JOSE, Dec. 19.â The Board of Man
agers of the Agnews Asylum met to-day
and awarded contracts for supplies for
the institution for the ensuing six months.
When this work was finished the board
went into executive session. White, who
wants a thorough investigation of the
asylum, brought up the question of pro
ceeding with the secret investigation of
Bessie Bailey's death. Last Thursday,
after adopting a resolution that the girl
came to her death frum natural causes,
the managers reopened the case at the
request of Dr. Stocking. It was to have
been taken up again to-day. At the se
cret session the case was discussed, but
no action was taken. Curnow, Upham
end Hale, the others present, were not
in favor of delving any further into asy
lum affairs.
After the meeting White stated he was
in favor of a full and open investigation
of the conduct of the officials and at
taches at Agnews.
The appointment of H. R. Selby, a son
of ex-Supervisor J. S. Selby, as carpenter
at Agnews â¢is causing a great deal of
talk. J. S. Selby was an independent can
didate for County Treasurer, and it is
stated he entered the fight only to help
J. A. Lotz, Baa's candidate. The appoint
ment of his son through Curnow is looked
upon as a reward for aid rendered the
"gang" by the father.
SERIOUS IMPORT OF
PRINCE VICTOR'S VISIT
His Presence in Paris Was Known,
hut the Government Feared
to Arrest Him.
LONDON, Dee. 19.â The Paris corres
pondent of the Daily Chronicle says:
"Prince Victor Napoleon's recent so
journ in Paris was of more serious im
port than was at first surmised. His
presence was known, but the Govern
ment did not arrest him because M.
Dupuy, the Premier, believed his ar
rest would be the signal for a coup
d'etat, and he knew that he could not
rely upon either the police or the troops
commanded by General Zurlinden.
"Prince Victor intends to come again
at Christmas and remain until the new
year, when he hopes the League of Pa
triots will be able to force a convoca
tion of the National Assembly."

CADWALLADER WILL
NOT SERVE TIME
Acquittal of the Alleged Bank-
Wrecker Who Was Kidnaped
at Stockton.
STOCKTON, Deo. 19.â A letter from In
diana to a frigid of C. JI. Cudwallador
in this city says Cadwallader was re
cently acquitted of the* charge of bank
wrecking in that State. Cadwallader is
the young man who was arrested here
by local officers and veld for an Indiana
Sheriff, and waa rushed out of the State
on a special engine to beat habeas corpus
proceedings. At Truckee a writ issued
By a Sacramento Judge was served on
the Sheriff, but he went on and made
fast time to his home town. The trial
lasted twenty-two days. It was the Un
ion City National Bank that the young
man was charged with having wrecked.
FOR A LIEUTENANT GENERAL.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 19.â The House
Committee on Military Affairs made con
siderable progress on the Hull bill to in
crease the army. Some sharp opposi
tion was encountered to some provisions
of the bill, but the committee got be
yond sections 1 and 2, and the features
of these sections are considered settled.
The only party division was on the mo
tion of Hay of Virginia, that all troops
above 26,000 be confined to those required
for the foreign service, the Republicans
voting against it and the Democrats
for it.
Among the important provisions In the
sections passed Is that for one lieutenant
general.
In detail the organization in the sec
tions beyond which the committee has
passed is for an army consisting of one
lieutenant general, six major generals,
twelve brigadier generals, twelve regi
ments of cavalry, a corps of artillery and
thirty regiments of infantry, with the va
rious staff bureaus, thirty post chaplains,
the record and pension office, the retired
list and staff of the military academy.
Section 2 provides for the cavalry or
ganization into twelve troops formed of
twelve squadrons of four troops each.
BRYAN WRITES TO STEWART.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 19.â W. J. Bryan
has written the following letter to Sen
ator Stewart:
; WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 19. 1898.
Hon. "W. M. Stewart, United States Senateâ
My Dear Sir: I have Just read a dispatch from
Washington charging mo with unfriendliness to
you and friendliness to Congressman Newlands
in the pending Senatorial contest. I desire to
assure you that the above is entirely without
foundation. ,1 take it for granted that your
'State will select a silver man as Senator, but
1 have carefully avoided taking any part in the,
contest and have never expressed any prefer
em â  : I assume that your people are able to
choose wirely and they will properly resent any
attempt upon my part to influence their action
or give advice. Believe me, very truly yours,
W. J. BRYAN.
CHOYNSXI GETS THE DECISION.
CHICAGO, Dec. 19.â Joe Choynski was
given the decision over Ed Dunkhorst of
Syracuse, N. V., to-night after six rounds
of fighting. Dunkhorst entwred the ring
weighing 230 pounds, while Choynski
weighed but 102. Choynaki throughout
the tight was able to land pretty much as
he liked, although the big man came
back now and then with some heavy
counters. It was practically impossible
for a man of Choynski's size to knock out
a giant like Dunkhorst, and all that was
left for him to do was to pepper him at
long range. The decision was easily
Choynski's.
FASHODA EVACUATED.
CAIRO, Dec. 19.â Major Marehand an,!
his party evacuated Fashoda during the
morning of December 11, when the
French flag was removed and the British
and Egyptian flags were hoisted. The
French detachment started for the Sobat
River.

Yolo Teachers' Institute.
WOODLAND, Dec. 19.â The Teachers'
Institute convened in the M. E. Church
at 1:30 p. m. to-day. Owing to the in
clemency of the weather, the opening

The institute will be in session four days.
SECRET DOSSIER
NOW DEMANDED
Court of Cassation Has
So Ruled.
DISSENT OF THE DEPUTIES
OBJECTION TO GIVING UP ALL
THE DBEYFUS DOCUMENTS.
Failure of an Attempted Interpella
tion on the Alleged Indiscre
tions of the Brisson
Ministry.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Dec. 19.â The
French Court of Cassa
tion, according to a spe
cial dispatch from Paris,
has demanded the secret
dossier, undertaking not
to publish its contents.
PARIS, Dec. 19.â There was a repeti
tion this afternoon of the now fa
miliar scenes in the Chamber of Depu
ties. M. L,ascies, anti-Semite, interpel
lated the Government on the subject of
the alleged indiscretions of the Brisson
Ministry in the Dreyfus affair. He ac
cused the former premier, M. Brisson,
of violating the constitution and vio
lently attacked the Court of Cassation,
whose president, M. Loews, he said,
was a brother of a German official. The
speech of M. Lascies elicited uproar
and protests.
The Minister of War, M, de Freyci
net, replied that he did not desire to
appear as wishing to influence the de
cision of the Court of Cassution. But,
the Minister added while willing to
submit to the court all the official docu
ments in his possession, he was jibso
lutely determined not to submiT the
secret batch of documents in the case,
which, he pointed out, contained papers
affecting the security of tho nation. He
added that if the house did not ap
prove of his attitude he was willing to
resign.
M. Lascies said he thought that un
der the circumstances the revision of
the Dreyfus trial was only a comedy,
and he thanked M. de Freycinet for
furnishing official confirmation of the
report that the secret I ~*fh O f docu
ments so frequently referred to really
existed. He then withdrew his interpel
lation.
The Chamber later discussed an In
terpellation by M. Miller relative to the
conditions upon which the secret dos
sier would be communicated to the
Court of Cassation, as, he cantended,
Unless the court was put in possession
of all the documents the whole ease of
revision was vitiated.
M. Dupuy, the Premier, replied that
unless a guarantee of absolute secrecy
was forthcoming the Government would
not communicate thepe documents to
the court. The Premier declared also
that it was impossible to show the
documents to the de/ense unless t}:e
Government were absolutely assured of
secrecy.
M. Brlsson said: "There is no docu
ment in the Dreyfus dossier that could
affect the security of the state. I ex
amined the entire dossier after the dis
covery of the Henry forgery and con
sidered them all spurious."
M. Cavaignac, former Minister of
War, interjected: "Yes, M. Brisson and
M. Sarrien examined the documents. I
thought it necessary to show them.
Afterward I offered to show M. Brisson
certain documents in the hands of Gen
eral Conzo, in which there were ele
ments of conviction, but M. Rrisson
thought it useless to examine Ihr.se."
After further debate, which became
of an animated character, the chamber
by a vote of 370 against 80 approved the
attitude of the Government.

Vn-^330 MARKET ST. S.F.^Â§Â£^HOBSON GETS
MANY KISSES
AT KANSAS CITY
Women of All Ages Join in the
Rush to Hug the Young
Naval Hero.
KANSAS CITY. Dec. 19.â Lieutenant Richmond Pearson Hobson,
U. S. N., was the central figure in an osculatnry carnival at the
Coates Hotel this afternoon that clearly overshadowed any of the
kissing affairs in which the gallant Alabaman has figured since his
return from more serious duties at Santiago.
When Lieutenant Hobson
arrived from Chicago at 2
o'clock this afternoon, he was
cheered by several hundred
persons who had gathered at
the railway station. A recep
tion committee awaited with
carriages and along the route
from the station to his hotel
the hero of the Merrimac was
recognized and cheered. The
streets in the vicinity of the
hotel were crowded. In the
corridor of the hotel, sup
ported by the local reception
committee. Lieutenant Hobson
received and shook hands with
several hundred men.
The more exciting part of
it came a few minutes later,
when the lieutenant was es
corted to the parlors on the
second flooor, where over 400
women, young, old, handsome
and plain, awaited to greet the
popular hero. Most of them
came to be kissed, and 267 of
them, by actual count, were
not disappointed. Some of the
more matronly of them re
ceived a cordial handshakeand
were passed up the line, but
the most of them who showed the least inclination were embraced
and kissed.
To-night Lieutenant Hobson divided honors with Major General
Adna R. Chaffee, they being the guests of honor at the annual ban
quet of the Kansas City Commercial Club. General Chaffee. who has
been in the city for several days, responded to the toast. "The Fifth
Army Corps in Cuba." Lieutenant Hobson spoke to the toast, "The
American Navy."
After the banquet Lieutenant Hobpon departed for Denver on the
fast mail train of the Santa Fe service, en route to San Francisco
and Manila.

STOCKTON, Dec. 19.â Rain began

SACRAMENTO, Dec. 19.â Last night j
the Sacramento Valley had another
generous downpour of rain and farmers
will have no cause for the blues at
Christmas time. The fall of rain in I
this city from 12 o'clock last night to j
9:30 this morning amounted to .60 of
an inch. The rainfall for this month j
bo far is 1.20 inches, making for this j
season 2.81 inches as against 4.38 inches
to an equal date last year. The a\ Â»r- j
age rainfall for December during the
past fifty years was about 4.50 inches. |
Sacramento has not yet had half as i
much as the usual average rainfall. â 
The greatest amount ever known to j
have fallen in December was 13.40

conditions to-day are unsettled and
Fhowers are predicted for to-night. In
this county ranchers are unable to do
anything toward seeding for next
year's crop until rain comes, though
other counties of Southern California
have been more fortunate; and while
there has not been rain enough for
every purpose, the fields have been pre
pared on many places and seed put in.
Fruit trees are suffering for water.

QUARREL OVER
DICE FOLLOWED
BY A FIGHT
Private Henry of the Marine
Corps Dangerously Wounded
at Vallejo.
VALLEJO, Deo. 19. â A disgraceful affray occurred here early this
morning between Joe Curran, proprietor of Old Ketchum's place in
the tenderloin district, and Private Henry of the United States Ma
rine Corps, in which a lead pipe and a pistol were used. The trouble
originated over a dice game. Without warning Curran drew a pistol
from his pocket and commenced shooting at the sailor. Henry seized
a piece of lead pipe and a terrible struggle ensued.
The men wrestled each other to the floor, Curran using the butt
end of his revolver and the marine wielding the lead pipe. The ma
rine received what may prove fatal injuries. His head was cut open
in several places and one bullet grazed his cheek. Curran was badly
wounded.
Dr. Turner was summoned and found Henry in an unconscious
condition, very weak from loss of blood. His wounds were dressed.
It is impossible to tell the extent of his injuries. He was removed
to the Naval Hospital at noon. Curran's wounds are considered not
dangerous.
The affair was not surprising to the residents of Vallejo. For
years Old Ketchum's place has been classed as a dangerous resort
and an eyesore to the naval city. Just who was in the wrong can
not be ascertained, but Curran will undoubtedly be placed under aF
rest and held until the extent of the sailor's wounds are known.
District Attorney Devlin was on his way to the county seat when no
tified that the affray had occurred. He returned to Vallejo with
all possible speed and has been busy investigating the case. '
pects are for more rain to-night. Many
farmers are already plowing.
WALNUT CREEK, Dec. 19.â Rain
has fallen all over San Ramon Valley
since early this morning. The precipi
tation amounted to about .75 of an inch.
SUISUN, Dec. 19.â A soaking down
pour commenced early this morning
and continued during the day.
REDWOOD CITY, Dec. 19.â Rain fell
throughout San Mateo County last
night and part of to-day. The indica
tion" to-night are for more rain.
ANGELS CAMP, Dec. 19.â Rain com
menced to fall at an early hour this
morning and continued at intervals
during the day. Reports from the
mountains state that it has rained and
snowed to a great extent during the
last twenty-four hours. It is expected
many mines now idle will resume oper
ation.
ANDERSON, Dec. 19.â A heavy rain
fell last night and it is raining hard
to-night, with prospects for an all
night rain, (lood crops are assured.
WOODLAND. Dec. 19.â Rain began
to fall in gentle showers shortly after
midnight this morning. It has rained i
intermittently ever since. The wind is
in the southeast and ordinarily the in
dications would be considered good for
a general storm. Notwithstanding the
signal service predictions that the
weather will clear up on Tuesday, the
farmers, fruit growers and other busi
ness men are much encouraged with
the outlook. At S o'clock this morninc j
the prcipltation for the shower amount
ed .43 of an inch, making 2.93 inches
for the season.
NAPA, Dec. 19.â The rainfall in Naoa
up to 7 o'clock this morning amounted
to half an inch as measured by the |
gauge at the depot. At a corresponding
date last year the total was 4.46 inches.
The total for this year is now 3.29
inches. At Callstoga there was auite
a heavy rain during the night. .72 of an
inch being the record there at fi o'clock
this morning. A heavy mist has been
falling all day. There is every indica
tion for more rain to-night.
MILTON, Dec. 19. â Rain commenced
falling here last night, accompanied by
a strong wind from the southeast. At
noon about one inch had fallen, and
as the wind still blows strongly from
the rainy quarter a continuation of the
storm is expected. A large acreage has
been seeded and in many places grain
is up and growing nicely.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
KANSAS CITY, Dec. 19.â The Amerl.
can Federation of Labor opened the
{ second week of its annual convention
to-day with many resolutions still un
passed upon. To-day there was shown
a desire to hurry through with the
convention's business, and speechmak
ing was left for another time.
One of the resolutions was for Gov
ernment ownership of a system of tele
graph lines and the adoption of the
postal telegraph system was favored.
John M. Hanter, president of the
United Mine Workers of Illinois, shook
the convention up by reviewing the
strike at Yirden, where the strikers
only obtained a victory after a battle
and bloodshed. He thanked Governor
Tanner for not calling out troops to
protect the mine-owners.
The executive council was instructed
to petition President McKinley for the
pardon of E. W. Clarke, who is serving
a life sentence at Thomaston, Me.
Clarke was one of the crew of the ship
Jefferson Borden, which mutinied be
tween New Orleans and Liverpool and
murdered the ship's mate in 1576.
Three of the crew were arrested and
one, an Englishman, receiving assist
ance from the British Government, got
off with a ten-year sentence. Clarke
and a sailor named Miller were sent
to jail for life. Miller died and Clarke
is an imbecile. A plea will be made
for his pardon.
The federation struck from its con
stitution the 2 cents per capita tax for
support of striking organizations. This
was done because of the difficulty en
countered in collecting the tax and for
the reason that it has been the means
of disappointing many striking bodies

HOLDAY OR NO
HOLIDAY, THEY
MUST CONVENE
VIEWS ON THE OPENING OF
THE LEGISLATURE
Members of the Legal Fraternity Unani
mous in Their Interpretation of
the Constitution.
ACCORDING to the opinions of I
some of the leading attorneys
and jurists of this city there is
no possible doubt that the Leg
islature not only will but must
begin its session on Monday, January
2, despite the fact that this day is a
legal holiday.
Some of the individual opinions ex
pressed are as follows:
Robert Y. Hayne â
"Section 2 of article IV of the constitution of
1579 provides that "the -sessions of the legis
lature shall commence at 12 o'clock m. on the
first Monday after the first day of January
next succeeding the election of Its members.'
Without having made a critical examination
of this question it would seem to me to be
plain that the session should commence on the
second of January. The first day of January Is
Sunday; 'tho first Monday alter the first 'lay of
January' would be Monday. Unless there is
something in the constitution which says that
the Legislature shall not meet on a holiday the
above proposition would Bean to me to be ab
solutely clear. You have not called my at
tention to any provision that the Legislature
shall nut meet on a holiday and 1 have not
time to look for any such provision. I do not
think that the provisions of the codes could
override the constitution or that they were
intended to dn so. Of course you will under
stand I Just Rive you my offhand opinion, as
I have not studied the question critically."
Garret McEnerney â
"There Is no question that the cessions of the
Legislature mui-t and shall commence at noon
on the first Monday after the first day of
January succeeding the election. The mere
fact that that first Monday should happen to
be a holiday would, under the constitution, cut
no figure. I have not made a special study of
; thls point, but I am satisfied that 1 am right."
D. J. Murphy â
"You take me at a disadvantage In asking
me for an offhand opinion as to the effect ot
section 2, article IV, of our constitution, pro
viding for the first meeting of the Legislature.
It is a subject which I have not given any
serious thought to, but I will give you my
views. Now, It seems* to me, the language of
that section is very plain and speaks in an un
mistakable manner as to when the Legislature
shall moot. It will be admitted that Sunday
1r the first day of January, and that Monday
following is the second day of January, hence
If we are to give the language of section 2 Its
fair ordinary meaning, it is clear that the Leg
islature should meet on the second of January,
at 12 o'clock m. The provision of this section
is mandatory and so plain that the question r>(
construction does not come in. It Is perhaps
well to call your attention to another provision
of the constitution, which I think is anala
gous to the one under consideration. Section
2. article VI, of the constitution, provides that
the Supreme Court 'shall always be open for
the transaction of business,' and. as I remem
ber, our Supreme Court has held In accordance
with that provision that that court is always
open for the transaction of business on Sun
days, holidays and all other days. Tn Show
that the framers of the constitution intended
that that court should always be open, we
may look at section E of the same article which
relates to the Superior Courts, and that i-ec
tion provides, speaking of the Superior Courts,
"they shall always be open' (legal holidays and
non-Judicial days excepted). Thus it will be
seen that while the constitution provides that
the Supreme <^ourt shall always be open, it ex
empts the Superior Court from transacting
Judicial business on holidays and on non-Ju
dlclal days. I therefore think, for these rea
sons, that the Legislature should convene and
meet at 12 m. on Monday. January 2. The
constitutional provisions herein referred to re
lating to the courts are substantially re-enacted
in sections 47 and 73 of the Code of Civil Pro
cedure. I am not aware of any legislative act
that attempts in any manner to interfere with
the constitutional provision as to the meeting
of the Legislature, and even If such an act
did exist. I think it would be unconstitutional
as In conflict with section 2 of article IV."
T. Carl Spelling â
"Without looking into the matter, I would say
that the Legislature, being the supreme law
making power, may meet on the day fixed by
the constitution, and if the existing statute be
in the way of the validity of Its acting, which
I do not believe, it may on that day repeal or
amend such statute for the occasion. This,
while not Impossible, is scarcely practicable,
owing to the necessary time required to organ
ize. They must meet on the first Monday or
not meet at all, according to both the consti
tution and the statute."
Matt Sullivanâ
"The opinion on the subject expressed In to
day's Call is correct. Section 2 of article IV of
the constitution is mandatory. "The nrovisinns
of this constitution are mandatory and prohib
itory unless by express words they are declared
to rw otherwise. 1 (Art. IV, Sec. 22, Const. Cal.)
If the framers of ti.e constitution intended to
postpone the opening of the legislative session
In the event of the first Monday after the first
day of January next succeeding the election of
Its members falling upon a legal holiday, they '
would have inserted In our organic law
a provision to that effect. Xot having
done so. section 2, article IV, Is sus
ceptible of but one construction. There
Is nothing In any of our codes or statutes pro
| hlbitlng the Legislature from meeting on the
I first Monday after the first day of January if
i said Monday happens to be a holiday. If tnpre
I were such a legislative enactment it would be
unconstitutional and void, becau:e the consti-
I t-.itinn is tliÂ° paramount law of the State. Holi
| days are not fixed or ueflned by the oonstitu-
I tlon. The Legislature has nV> authority to
j nullify the mandatory provision? of section 2,
i article IV, of the constitution, which requires
the Legislature to meet on the first Monday
after the first day of January, by making that
Monday in the year 1899 a legal holiday. The
! Legislature has the right to and should con
vene at 12 m. on Monday, January 2, 1899."
I M. C. Hassett â
"I think the provisions of the constitution
are mandatory and that the Legislature should
meet on the first Monday In January. The
constitution was framed as the organic law by
which and through which the government of
the State is conducted. It says the Legislature
shall meet on the first Monday in January, and
that mandate must lie obeyed."
John E. Richards â
"I have read your article entitled 'Legal Knot
for Lawmakers,' and while the question it
presents might puzzle the minds of some of
the makers of our laws. It will not Drove a
difficult one for lawyers to untie. The State
constitution takes no note of holidays. Its pro
vision as to when the Legislature shall con
. vene Is mandatory, and properly bo, In order to
I avoid such confusion as your article euggests.
Holiday* are the creation of the Legislature,
and their time and number are prescribed in
i the Codes. It requires no argument to show
that the plain provisions of the constitution
designating the day and even the hour when
the Legislature must convene cannot be modi
fied nor in any manner affected by a statute.
The constitution might have provided that the
Legislature should convene upon the first day
of January or the fourth of July, or any other
day which might have been previously or which
might he thereafter set apart by statute as a
legal holiday. The precise command of thÂ» con
stitution must, of course, prevail, and any at
tempt to postpone the day designated for the
election of a t'nited States Senator upon such
a pretext would be nothing less thnn a gross
violation of the express mandate of the organic
law."
George W. Monteithâ
"The constitution being lex suprema is abso
lute, and the constitution does not recognize
the existence of holidays in a case of this kind.
Many years ago the question came up at a
time when the fourth of March fell on Sunday.
I think it occurred during Monroes administra
tion, and Chief Justice Marshal was appealed
to, and he took the ground that th> constitu
tion should be obeyed, but that it was not the
puri-ose of the constitution to compel the per
formance of a secular act upon Sunday, and he
therefore held that the inauguration of the
President should take place on the fifth day of
March, which was Monday. But that "rule
which he applied to Sunday would not apply
to any other holiday. The statutory holidays
outside of Sundays include New Year's day,
and while I am satisfied if the constitu
tion Bet the first day of the year, that, follow
ing Chief Justice Marshall'! decision, Monday
would be the day, a fortiori where the consti
tution specifies Monday without any qualifica
tion whatever, it must be held that it means
what it says, and that the Legislature must
meet on the second day of January."
Judge S. C. Denson â
"The setting of a holiday is a Legislative
enactment and cannot affect a constitutional
provision. 1 cannot see what will prevent the
Legislature from meeting January 2, IVJ3 Sec
tion 2, article 4. Is mandatory and th<? Politi
cal Code follows the direction of the Constitu
tion. Section 10 of the Code of Criminal Pro
cedure establishes holidays on every Sunday,
January- 1. February 22, May 30, July 4, Septem
ber 30, first Monday in September. December 25,
general election days and Thanksgiving days,
the last two days being designated by the
President or Governor. Section 11 of the Code
of Political Procedure says If January 1 Feb
ruary 22. July l, December 25, fall upon Sun
day, the following Monday is the holiday. Sec
tion 134 of the same code says no court shall
open on these holidays nor shall any judicial
business be transacted on the holidays or on
Sundays. This only refers to Judicial' business
and not the Legislative. There are, however,
exceptions to this, for a court may give in
structions to a Jury or receive the verdict of
a jury and engage in a few other matters in
its criminal business on holidays. Besides be
ing In accordance with the Constitution the
Legislature has fixed the time of its own meet
ing in section 235 of the Political Code. The
Legislature has not attempted to change the
constitutional provision and could not do so It
it should attempt such a thing. I think that
body will meet January 2. UM and will be
clearly In the right in doing bo."
General J. H. Dickinson â
"We will meet January 2, ISM, holiday or no
holiday. The Constitution says the Legislature
shall meet on that day and I know of no rea
son why it should not. Holidays cut no figure
at all. Of course if a working majority of the
members vote to adjourn early and go out to
eat Turkey, possibly they will do ho. I don't
Imagine there is a prohibitory clause in the
Political or Civil Code to prevent such a pro
ceeding. I have served in the California Leg
islature through holidays and nobody offered
to object."
Eugene F. Bert â
"There is nothing to prevent the Legislature
from meeting January 2 simply because the
public choose to observe that day as a New
Year's holiday. The wording of the Constitu
tion is r)Jain on the subject."
Andrew Clunie â
"All Legislative enactments are clearly In the
line of the Constitution, which sign!neÂ« when
the Legislature should meet. If a holiday
happens to fall on the second of January there
would be nothing to prevent a Legislature from
working on that day."
Hon. R. P. Ashe â
"I' believe that it was the Intention of the
Legislature to meet January 2 '599 as there
was no legal reason why It should not do so
A Legislature is not a court and cannot be
prevented from certain Judicial proceedings on
a legal holiday."

Raisins and Currants.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 19.â Senator Per
kins to-day introduced a resolution pro
viding for a division of mines and mining
in the United States Geological Survey.
Representative Barham has already in
troduced in the House a bill creating a
Bureau of Mines and Mining. It is
thought that the object of this bill may
be attained by Senator Perkins' resolu
tion and at a great saving- of expense to
the Government.
Senator Perkins to-day received from
California samples of seedless raisins and
Zante currants, which he has handed to
Reciprocity Commissioner Kasson. These
currants come into direct competition
with similar fruits of the Mediterranean.
It is practically settled th\t reciprocity,
so far as it relates to these fruits, will
not be pushed to a conclusion, but the
California delegation are not relaxing
their efforts for its defeat.
Senator Perkins and Representative
Barham have prepared a bill which will

MRS. HEARST BUYS A
SPLENDID ART WORK
Has Purchased and Will Bring to i
America D'Epinay's Bust of
Jeanne d'Arc.
Special Cable to The Tall and the New York
Herald. Copyright ed, IS9S, by James Gor
don Bennett.
PARIS, Dec. 19.â France has lost an op
portunity to keep a remarkable art work,
and, as usual, America has seized it.
Mrs. Fhebe Hearst has bought Prosper
d'Epinay's marble bust of Jeanne d'Arc,
her Intention being to present It to the
Washington Museum after it has been
publicly exhibited in New York for a
short time.
During the last month the most distin
guished personalities in Paris have ad
mired unreservedly the bust, where M. !
d'Eplnay has realized the marvelously
strange union of mysticism and martial
ardor that makes the Maid of Orleans one
of the most attractive and enigmatical
figures in French history. The Grand
Dukes Vladimir and Alexis paid more
than one visit.
The bust is to be taken from the studio
to-morrow, packed and be sent direct to
New York, probably on Saturday.
The suggestion is made that M. d'Epi
nay enlarge his equestrian statue to
colossal proportions, so that it might be
placed on the little hill at Domremy,
Jeanne d'Arc's birthplace. The Duchess
de Chevreuse and several other grandes I
dames are said to be willing to take '
place at the head of a committee to re
ceive subscriptions for casting the statue. I
When the hdge monument is completed it
would be offered to the French nation.

far as the latter is concerned, the fight
will be fought over again.
The vote to-night surprised both sides.
Harrison believing he had a majority of

CLAIMS HE FIRED
IN SELF DEFENSE
James Moss Shoots and Fatally
Wounds Matt Brannan, a Car
son Athlete.
CARSON, New, Dec. 19.â There was
a shooting affair this afternoon at what
; is known as the "110" house, occupied
;by Esther Coronado. Matt Braniyin, a
i local athlete, was probably fatally
j wounded by James Moss, who formerly
( was employed at the Briggs House. The
j bullet struck Brannan in the abdomen.
JHe was taken to the Sheriff's office,
| where a hurried examination of the
wound was made by Dr. Guinan. Bran
nan was removed to his mother's home
|in a very serious condition. Moss
â  started at once for the Sheriff's office
and gave himself up.
The trouble originated at a fire which
took place about twelve hours previous
ly, when Esther Coronado was taken
out unconscious from a burning
building. After the fire Moss took
charge of the woman and was trying
jto restore her. This seemed to anger
I Brannan and he made insulting re-
I marks regarding Moss and the woman.
j Moss took her to "110" and was there
I caring for her, when, according to his
: story, James Barrett, Jerry Connolly
; and Matt Brannan came in and tried
j to force the door of the room he was
i in. Moss protested, and after a few
words Brannan struck him in the face
and he shot in self-defense.
Miss said at the jail that Brannan,
j Connolly and Barrett had been after
i him some time looking for a row, and
I he carried a revolver with which to
j defend himself. Brannan, when he
; came in, jumped at him and struck him
j over the eye. There is a black and blue
! spot on his fe".ce where he was struck.
Deputy Sheriff Knoblock said that on
1 Sunday Moss had told him that he ex
j pected trouble with Brannan, Barrett
i and Connolly, and was obliged to arm
himself in order to stand them off.
Brannan says that if he dies it will
!be cold-blooded murder. He is still
: alive, but sinking.

CORRUPTION ON DISPLAY.
THE time has come for a protest against the
crowds who go to the Botkin trial. So un
speakably filthy are the proceedings that re
porters, accustomed as they are to every phase of lite,
would fain escape the fetid ordeal. Nevertheles
courtroom is thronged daily, and among the specta
tors are women and girls. The admission must be
made with astonishment and shame. These females,
if they wholly lack the decency belonging to their sex.
if they are without a sense of modesty to which to
appeal, should be driven away by the clubs of the
police. With necks craned and ears alert to catch
every salacious bit, these brazen harpies constitute a
spectacle at which humanity blushes.
Yesterday the man Dunning was on the stand. It
lias been said that he is a degenerate, and he is prov
ing the estimate correct. According to his story he
it. without conscience or suggestion of moral quality.
He told n( orgies so debased as to be almost beyond
I clief, and in which he was a participant. Unscathed
and unblanching he betrayed his associates. Finally,
some latent spark of manhood within him being
touched, he refused to reveal his partners in other
intrigues. He is in jail for contempt now â contempt
of court merely â but it he had senses to realize with,
he would know that seldom has a creature been
dragged from the slums into the light and made a
figure so contemptible as himself, and a normal im
pulse would be to ask for the darkest cell, slink into
the darkest corner of it. and pray for death.
Dunning says that San Francisco is on a low moral
plane. Perhaps it is. It tolerated him for a time,
Mid it can still produce petticoated freaks who will
listen while he details a depravity so foul that the soul
shrinks from him, and the mind wonders that such a
degenerate can exi=t and move among men.
KISSING AS A BUSINESS.
WITH all respect for the memory of Hobson's
valiant deed, it must be remarked that by the
aid of divers women the young officer is rap
idly changing into a star spangled ass.
When the kissing business is carried to an extreme
it becomes disgusting. To place a respectful salute
upon the chaste lips of beauty is ever a delight, but
merely to smack each female in a long procession
filing by with mouths pursed and heads perked for
promotion of the oscillatory riot is another thing.
The kiss bestowed under the calcium glare loses its
charm; given for the joying of the gallery, it becomes
a spectacle at the which strong men shudder.
Several ladies have declined to kiss Hobson. Their
names should be writ large. They are not hysterical,
slobbery, hero worshipers, but give evidence of hav
ing been blessed with sense and modesty. Hobson
was once given credit for similar attributes, but his
judgment seems to have oozed from him. He has
caught the infection of foolishness.
Such promiscuous kissing recalls the theory of mi
crobes, which asserts that organisms, concealed
within the mouth, spring forth when another mouth
gets too close, carrying with them all manner of ills.
If the microbe theory is correct, Hobson will sweep
across the country like a plague. From the Atlantic
to the mid-West he has been harvesting the microbes,
and as he gathers them, so must he scatter. In the
rosebud of the garden lurks the worm, and in the
labial rosebud there may lurk the germ of phthisis,
dyspepsia, disordered liver. Let Hobson beware.
He is doing the country a wrong. If he but garnered
these bacteria to flourish in his own system, why he
iz brave and may not shrink from the risk, but as he
kisses from shore to shore, so must he leave in his
wake a train of disorders.
Moreover, some male, not carried away by the
august presence of Hobson and desiring a monopoly
of the favors usually granted by a wife or a sweet
heart, may object to seeing a lady love put on ex
hibition as one striving for the prize for silliness, and
smite the hero of the Merrimac. Anyhow the cus
tom will lead to trouble. What lover could patiently
endure to witness the cheapening of privileges he had
regarded as all his own? Some foolish females may
find, if they want to be kissed again, that they will
have to hunt up Ilobson and once more stand in line.
Hobson must be given to understand in advance
(hat he can't kiss San Francisco girls as a candidate
kisses babies. They do not have to await the im
portation of a hero to get all the kisses good for
them.
Perhaps the trip of the Kaiser to the Holy Land
was not a success, but we hesitate to ascribe this, as
a French paper does, to the fact that he found him
self unable to walk on the Sea of Galilee.
It was about time anyhow for the Cincinnati to
strike a rock or something. Too long a period of
good luck would have made the crew apprehensive.
A clairvoyant declares there will be a dry season
for two years and that Burns will be defeated. This
makes, a iair average. x>f luck^ ,
THE ADULTERATED WINE.
: 1 T (IS indeed to be lamented that there is a general |
I admission of the fact that the wine seized in Mex
ico was treated with salicylic acid, and it is de
plorable that an attempt is made to conceal responsi
bility and to justify the adulteration.
One of the men connected with the organization
which supplied this condemned shipment and which i
controls the commerce in our wines, after laying it J
on the country vintners and declaring it impossible j
to test all the wines shipped By his association, says i
there is no harm in salicylic acid, anyway, and that j
it must be used in young wines sent into the Mexican I
climate. The earlier authorities do not assign pois
onous principles to salicylic acid. It is the active
chemical principle found in the bark and leaves of
the willow, the "salix," from which it derives its
name. It is not confined to the willow, however, but
is found in the oil of wintergreen and other vegetable
substances, and also in some minerals. Its effect is
to arrest fermentation. It if used to arrest the natu
ral and necessary fermentations in dry wines, so as
to put them on the market as aged wines, when, in j
fact, they are young, raw. crude and unwholesome.
Various chemical authorities are referred to by the
wine man we have quoted in proof of his assertion
that this drug is harmless, and in the same breath
he speaks of its use on young wines? For what pur
pose? Obviously for no other than to arrest the i
cleansing process of fermentation which makes them
fit for use. If salicylic acid were harmless as rain
water in itself, but by arresting fermentation left wine i
loaded with the organic matter which is dangerous i
tc life, its use is fatal to health and against the law.
The chemical opinion of its benign use in catsup I
is quoted, as if the fermentation of wine and catsup
were analogous. The fermentation of catsup is de- ;
leterious and destructive. It is not to cleanse and
purify, but to render unwholesome, and therein is
exactly the reverse of the natural fermentation of I
wine. Therefore the same agent which would sup- I
press fermentation in both would made the wine
dangerous to health, but leave the catsup innocuous
and wholesome, provided the agent itself were non
toxic.
The wine men defend the use of this drug by de
claring that a drinker gets more of it in a glass of j
beer than in a gallon of wine. Perhaps these apolo- !
gists are not aware that life insurance companies are j
more afraid of the modern beer drinker, and shy
from him oftener as a risk, than of the confirmed con
sumer of straight whisky. This was not the case un
der the old system of low brewed beer, ripened in
months of storage in the cellars.
The modern beer drinker is subject to troubles of
the liver and kidneys, to Bright's disease, diabetes, j
acute nephritis and similar ills, and if it be true that j
modern beer is treated with salicylic acid to age it j
prematurely, only another reason against using this
drug is supplied.
We cannot avoid the feeling that the tone assumed
by the wine men in discussing this incident is de
plorably damaging to California wine interests. It
is not true that the climatic change between this
State and the central plateau of Mexico makes neces
sary the use of this acid in wines to preserve them.
It they are properly aged and fermented they need j
no such treatment, or, if they do, they should not be I
sent where they require it. A market should be
sought where they can be used in their purest and \
best state, and they should be sent there in that state i
and in no other.
They should be aged, that is to say, be cleansed by
natural fermentation, and should not go to the con
sumer until that process is finished.
It is evident that greed, grasping for the price of
eld wine for young, is responsible for this incident
in Mexico. Greed, not long ago, mixed five barrels j
of young California brandy with eighty barrels of raw
high wines only two months out of a Nebraska dis
tillery, and about twenty-five barrels of water and
coloring and flavoring drugs, and branded it "old
California Grape brandy,' and the Collector of the |
Port in San Francisco, with a knowledge of its make
up, officially connived at its shipment to England j
under that lying brand.
If these things are to go on, the vineyards of this
State may as well be grubbed out, for in a few years
no one will touch a California wine or brandy.
Some missionary should go and preach to the wine
association that commercial honor is commendable
altogether, and that to admit, deplore and justify in j
one breath the adulteration of wine is destructive of
trade.
0 NEW ARGUMENT.
THE Examiner, which advocates the conversion
of the Philippines into a sweat-box for Ameri
can labor, has found a new argument. It is
that a New York bank has cut the rate of interest
to zYz per cent per annum, and that in order to bring
interest back to its former proportions new fields for
the investment of capital must be found. Imperial
ism, therefore, is to accomplish the double purpose
of enabling capital to secure enormous profits abroad
and to check enterprise at home. This is a frank
admission which will be duly appreciated by Ameri
cai. citizens whom the Examiner endeavored to bully
into the support of the fusion platforms and candi
dates on the ground of hostility to trusts, corpora
tions and the aggressions of the money power.
BALLOT MACHINE VOTING.
AS THE time draws near for the Legislatures
of the various States to assemble, an increased
consideration is given to the subject of provid
ing for future elections by ballot machine voting.
The issue is more warmly discussed in the East than
elsewhere, but in a general way all sections of the
Union are showing interest in it.
The cause of the increased support given to the
plan is the success attained with machine voting in
New York during the recent election. While ballot
ing by machinery has not been adopted in New York
as a State system, the law permits the local adoption
of it, and in the last election such machines were used
ac Rochester, Utica, Jamestown, Hornellsville and
several smaller communities. Reports from all of
these show that the results were in every respect sat
isfactory.
From our Eastern exchanges we learn that in all
of these places the use of the machines not only gave
the results of the election more promptly than was
possible by the old system of counting, but that there
was a great economy in their use. In Rochester it
iÂ« estimated the saving amounted to $iz,ooo and in a
town as small as Jamestown with a voting strength of
only 3400 the City Clerk estimates the saving in sala
ries amounted to upward of $800 and the saving in
printing and other expenses brought the total up to
$1800.
Estimates of this kind founded on actual experi
ence from tests made in a considerable number of
cities are valuable. They afford a basis on which safe
calculations can be made, and deserve the attention of
all legislators who are desirous of providing an
economical as well as a safe and speedy method of
conducting elections.
s Jhe. report made- b* the pomauttcc- *paoiated-4jx.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 20, 1898.
I the California Legislature of 1897 is good as far as it
! goes, and shows a careful inquiry into the construe
! tion and merits of the various machines submitted for
investigation, but it ought to be supplemented by a
report upon the results of the tests in New York.
No experimental investigation, however carefully and
intelligently made, can be of equal value to the test
of actual operation in elections where large numbers
j of voters make use of the machines, and that is the
! test which the New York elections afford.
In the F.ast the subject is being urgently pressed
upon public attention, and it seems fairly certain that
in many States the New York plan of local option
will be followed, while in some a State system of
machine voting will be adopted. California should
not be a laggard in the reform. Our system of voting
is costly, the counting is slow and subject to frauds.
Any system which will decrease the cost and increase
the rapidity and the honesty of the count is certainly
to be desired.
GOOD THfIT ROSSER DID.
INDIGNATION aroused by the farcical verdict
which held young Rosser not guilty, after he had
taken the life of an inoffensive and worthy man, j
has not yet died away. That verdict, as we have said |
before and may again, was a disgrace to everybody j
concerned. However, some good may come of it.
Peculiarly pitiful was the figure cut by the police.
Had Chief Lees been half as active in efforts to
prove the guilt of Rosser as he was in proving the j
innocence of Figel, the Kentucky soldier would be
in the penitentiary now, instead of on his way home
ward. No official interest seemed to be taken in the ;
prosecution. Chief Lees was sputtering over the
Botkin case, and the prosecutor who had the conduct
ing of the Rosser trial was a weak sister at the law, or
had no desire to convict. By the phrasing of his
questions he shut out testimony which would have
been effective in establishing the guilt of the prisoner.
He displayed no vigor in hunting up witnesses, nor
extracting information from them if they happened
to be found.
The jury may claim to have been guided by the in
structions of Judge Wallace, and if they were, no
wonder that aged jurist was so sick that he had to get
another member of the bench to read the instructions.
Even the manner of the reading was bad. The sub
stitute took no interest and his elocutionary ability is
limited. However, if Judge Wallace was to blame,
and we would regard his instructions as strongly
biased in favor of the prisoner, he will go from office
with a stain on his record.
Chief Lees professes great indignation at the mis
carriage of justice, but he does not go to the extent
of declaring himself incompetent and resigning.
Deputy Hinkle yowls feebly at the result, but neither
does he seem to think of getting out of the way and
giving some conscientious deputy a chance to enforce
the law rather than bring it into* ridicule.
Despite all these facts, disgraceful as they are, the
Rosser verdict may be productive of good. It has
revealed again and emphasized the incompetency of
Chief Lees; it has shown the folly of putting a lot of
conscienceless dullards in the jury-box; and it has
demonstrated that a prisoner with a pull can escape
punishment for crime. There is a limit to endurance,
and reform will follow. Rosser was not a moral man
led suddenly to err. On the contrary he was quarrel
some and dangerous, a bully, shunned by his fellow
soldiers as a nuisance and charged with dishonesty.
He had no spotless record to bring to court; there
was no doubt as to his guilt, and yet he was turned
loose.
The outrageousness of the entire proceeding has
impressed the people. They demand that such traves
ties shall cease. They demand that the senile Chief
shall attend as well as he can to duty, that juries shall
be sane, and courts unbiased.
IAN IRREPRESSIBLE FREE TRADER.
SENATOR VEST of Missouri is one of those
free traders who have become too oH to learn
from the events of the time, or to profit by the
teachings of recent experience. His free trade ideas
have become a monomania with him. Finding the
general doctrine impracticable at this time, he is mak
ing a last ditch light for free trade in ships.
In discussing the subject in the Senate the other day
he bitterly denounced the recommendations of the
President in favor of promoting the upbuilding of an
American merchant marine by the construction of
ships in our own shipyards. He maintained that the
existing navigation laws of the country are bad, but
that the adoption of the President's policy would
make the system worse. Warming to his theme he
said:
"Let the American buy his ships where he can buy
cheapest. Take off this relic of monarchy, this miser
able legislation that prohibits an American from buy
ing where he can buy cheapest. Let him raise what
he pleases and carry it abroad in his own ship and
under his own flag."
If Senator Vest were capable of learning anything
from events going on around him he would perceive
that the surest way of providing our merchants with
the best ships at the lowest cost would be to build up
American shipyards to compete with the foreigners.
A few years ago steel plate was imported from Europe
to this country. The Republican party gave protec
! tion to the industry, and we are now manufacturing
j steel plate cheaper than any nation in the world and
are actually exporting it to Great Britain.
At the present time the material for ship building
can be obtained more cheaply in the United States
than anywhere else. Give the American shipbuilder
j a chance to build up his industry and without reduc
j ing wages he will ere long be furnishing ships cheaper
| than the British. The history of the steel plant indus
t try will be repeated, and the protective system again
vindicated.
By adopting the free trade policy proposed by Sen
ator Vest our merchants would indeed obtain ships
to carry our produce abroad, but our labor would
be unemployed and our money would be sent out of
the country to pay for the purchased ships. By adopt
ing the Republican policy we shall get the ships, em
ploy our labor and save our money at the same time.
California has been aroused to a sense of demand
ing justice in the cases of people who shoot other
people, yet here is pretty Evelyn Holt likely to es
cape trial for shooting at Conrad Fecker, although
the evidence is conclusive that she did not kill him.
One of the presents of the Sultan to the ruler of
Germany was a lot of ground to which he held no
title. The case is likely to lead to litigation so ex
tensive that in the interests of peace the Kaiser should
haste to give a quitclaim.
An "aged" woman, who committed suicide in the
park, now has a grievance almost sufficient to bring
her to life. It seems that while reported as 60 in
reality she was twenty years younger.
An Oakland widow refused to tell her age in court
and we are glad of it. The matter could not possibly
have been any of the attorney's business.
The public will await with impatience the portrayal

BURNS' ELECTION AN
INSULT TO MEXICO
Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir: There
is a legal international point of law
that I desire to call your attention to
which seems to have been overlooked,
and that is this: The Government of

half on former occasions, and for your great

A POSSIBLE SOLUTION OF
THE PHILIPPINE QUESTION
There Is a great diversity of opinion
expressed as to the form of government
which we should bestow on the Philip
pine Islands so that we may safely strad
dle the fence which divides republican-
Ism from imperialism. The gravity of
the question lies in that it will probably
entail such an abrupt departure from the
principles on which our republic has been
reared that it will be a source of contin
ual dissatisfaction in our midst. It is one
thing to colonize on this continent and in
territory adjacent to ourselves, and quite
another thing to acquire territory over
7000 miles away, containing 5.000,000 peo
ple of a race, color, language and customs
so entirely different from our own, and
which people are incapable of self-gov
ernment and will be for decades, partic
ularly when this foreign territory lies di
rectly in the path of foreign complica
tions and its people can never become
citizens of the United States and enjoy
the privileges of which the American Sag
Is the emblem.
At this period It may not be amiss for
any humble citizen of this country to
offer suggestions as to the policy to be
pursued, and some merit may be found in
the following plan:
First Invite all nations to enter into a
treaty guaranteeing the permanent integ
rity and neutrality of the Philippine
group In exchange for a slightly quali
fied form of "open door" policy, which
will permit the United States to have the
advantage of 25 per cent reduction from
any prevailing tariff on import duties.
Secondâ The governing power to b
vested in a board of five Commissioner
appointed by the President of the United
States, to hold office at his discretion.
Such are the essential features.
THE TREATY.
All nations desire equal trade and com
mercial privileges; they would prefer the
Philippine group to be independent rather
than that any single nation should own
it; thus, in event of war, the islands
would not change hands or become a fac
tor in political complications; they would
be protected by all the powers from in
fringement of neutrality laws; they
would enjoy perpetual peace with the out
side world. All first-class powers (with
possibly one or two exceptions) now have
trade relations with the Philippines which
they do not wish disturbed by the country
being made exclusively American; it is,
therefore a selfish interestâ always the
most effective-that would persuade them
to enter into such a treaty, and it is qu te
consistent with reason that they Â»ouM
naturally recognize the right of the Lql
ted States to have a preferential duty of
25 per cent less on imports, which is due
b- reason of conquest and necessary
through the higher price of labor in
The treaty would provide that citizens
of any nation party to the treaty would
have the same rights to acquire propertj
and transact business as those o anj
other nation, including even the United
States. Such nations as refused to be
party to the treaty could be excluded en
tirely or could be made to pay 50 per
cent higher duties, and their citizens not
allowed to become property holders or
invested with the rights of citizens of
other nations.
With a treaty of this character in force
the question of an army, navy or forti
fications for the group would be entirely
eliminated. In itself this would mean an
enormous burden saved to the islands; or
to the United States if it was obliged to
assume the sole protection of the group.
It does not require much profound
thought to perceive what a colossal un
dertaking It would be for us to place the
islands in such a defensive condition as
would enable them to resist the attack
of any first-class power. Would we not
have lost them, had we owned them, if
we had lately been at war with any of
the powers except Spain? Of course, we
could thoroughly protect these islandsâ it
only requires time and an enormous out
lay of moneyâ but is the game worth the
candle, and can we not, with the aid of
the proposed preferential duty, advance
our interest* as much as we can reason
ably desire?
Free trade with the islands would oc
casion no end of dissatisfaction and
complications in the United States. AVo
do not want competition with coolie labor.
If we demanded that our imports into the
islands should be free of duty, how could
we discriminate against the products of
the Islands by a duty on their imports
into this country? And that leads us to
ask, "Where would the revenues neces
sary to support the islands come from if
the Philippines received no duty on their
imports? Certainly the United States
would not want to make immense appro
priations every year out of its treasury
to support the group; and, finally, if we
had free trade and all other nations paid
the duty, they would be largely â if not
entirelyâ shut out of trade with the isl
ands, and the loss of their present com
merce would make our possession of the
group most unpopular and invite re
prisals.

under the protection of the world, to eight
millions of people low in the scale of life,
with the opportunity for their advance
ment. It would place us before the world
as a benevolent power, not striving for
foreign conquest so much as for freedom
and liberty to mankind. It is out of the
question to believe that Congress, with its
ever shifting policy, due to party vims
and frequent elections, can ever handle
this matter with perfect satisfaction. We
have not yet reached the zenith of self
government ourselves. Our negro prob- 'â 
lfm has not yet been settled on a basis
that justifies us in the belief that our
*/â¢Â«â¢' smen Cf L n cx PÂ«st to handle the more
difficult problem of the government of
eight millions of a race that we do not
know or understand.
We have strayed too far already from
our first principles, and we do not want
to have this matter a feature of every
political campaign. J
THE GOVERNMENT.
We must consider the group to be an
estate, for which the United States is to
assume the role of administrator, and it !
must be kept out of the hands of tae poli
ticians. The President of the United
States, by special act of Congress, should
have the sole appointing power of five
commissioners, to hold office during his
pleasure, and each to receive a salary of
not less than $25,000 per annum, which
wouk: be an inducement to our best men
to serve; they should also be provided
with suitable quarters, all at the expense
of the revenues of the islands. T - com
missioners should hold office during the
pleasure of the President of the United
States, but should not otherwise be con
trolled by him. They are to take up their
residence in Manila and are to be en
tirely free in their action, supreme in
power to administer the affairs of the Is
lands in every particular, make laws of
every description, including tariff laws,
inaugurate an unsectarian free school
system, provide for judiciary and police,
and, in fact, form a government that will
be self-sustaining and conducted on busi
ness principles.
Educate the natives; give them appoint
ments when their qualifications will per
mit, and invest them with equal rights. I
Educate abroad at the expense of the
country a certain number of the Philip
pine youth, thus opening to them the op
portunity of mingling in the affairs of
their own government.
In the event of internal troubles, such
as insurrections, support the commission
ers with American troops, with an Amer
ican army and navy, but payment to be
made to the United States out of the rev
enues of the islands for the expense.
Form a military police force of natives,
well paid, and under guidance of Ameri
can officers. The commissioners to fill all
offices with American citizens, except
where natives could more properly be em
ployed, the object of the whole being a
beneficent government, satisfactory to the
tenets of high civilization.
FLAG. #
The islands should have a flag of their
own, to be adopted by the commissioners,
but not to be used on the high seas. This
restriction would prevent possible compli
cations in event of war between any of
the powers party to the treaty, and would
at the same time promote the patriotic in
stinct in the natives.
Incidental to this plan, the commission
ers should pay to the United States out of
the revenues of the islands $40,000,000. of
which we are to pay Spain $20,000,000 under
our treaty of peace, the balance to be re
tained by the United States as indemnity
toward the cost of war expenses. Possi
bly it might be found expedient not to ex
act this latter sum.
The commissioners would divide their
government into departments, at the head
of which they would place responsible and
efficient Americans. These various depart
ments would require an enormous number
of offices to be filie-. whic. would open
opportunities for American citizens, and
this, together with the 25 per cent pref
erential duty, would be a source or Im
mense strength to us in the commerce of
the islands.
I FREE TRADE AND PROTECTORATE.
It must be remembered that the Chi
nese are a prominent feature in the popu
lation of the islands. Are we going to
apply the exclusion law to them?
Free trade between the Philippine
Islands and the United States is as im
possible as between the United States and
China.
What would a protectorate mean? Sim
ply that, for the sake of a portion of the
trade of the islands the United States
would tax its people and sacrifice their
lives for the defense of the islands out
of all proportion to the benefits received
from trade. If we need a coaling station
for war purposes we can find one outside
of the group.
THOSE WHO WILL OPPOSE THIS
PLAN.
1. The average politician, hungry for
the spoils.
2. That portion of our manufacturing el
ement who will ask for free trÃde, having
nothing to fear themselves from compe
tition with the islands.
3. The jingo, who believes in expansion
at any cost.
A few short months ago none of these
classes would have advocated accepting
the islands as a present, but now that we
have, them they are willing to go to the
extreme and will not favor any moderate
or conservative policy.
I la-cpAduslon I believe that-the plan, out-
lined when understood by the insurgent
element, will satlsy them If they can be
satisfied with anything reasonable. \\ lth
the knowledge that the powers of the
world are arrayed against them and that
the Government proposed for them will
insure liberty, equality and advancement,
freedom from religious intnleration and
unjust taxes, if they do not lay down
their arms then, under such conditions,
I we would Indeed have a stupendous and
costly task to control them under any
other form of policy.
This plan simply cuts the group loose
from the United States as far as politics
is concerned and provides for its affairs
being conducted on business principles,
under the protection of the world.
Th<Â» responsibility for the abuse of pow
er by the Commissioners would be with
the "President of the United States, he
haying the privilege of revoking their ap
pointment.

trouble was caused by the cabin windows

of other officers who may in future have
to travel by that transport they should
be moved to some other portion of the
cabin. These particular windows open
out on the forward deck, and at night, if
the curtains are not drawn across them,
throw a very strong light, which is very
distracting to the man on the bridge. As
it might prove a source of danger, Cap

chief steward to have the curtains closed.
Schwartz, the watchman in the
cabin, was sent to do the job. He closed
one curtain and went to the other. When
he turned around the first one was

Barber Heinz at this point arose and
was so manifestly opposed to the pro
posed legislation and asked such pointed
questions about the finances that he was
called to order by the Chairman, and Sec
retary Barber Fuchs arose and swore by
the "beard of the prophet" that the
money collected, $20.20, was honestly ex
pfndt'd and he gave the figures to support
his contention. Becoming historical, he
said, that in early times the operations
of the barber were not confined as now
to shaving or hair cutting, but included
the dressing of wounds and other sur
gical operations. The art of shaving and
the art of surgery went hand in hand.
The barbers and surgeons were separated
and made two distinct corporations in
France in the time of Louis XIV and in
England in 1745. It was now in order to
restore the tonsorial artist to his pristine
glory. He thought that a barber was as

STANTON TELLS
HIS STORY TO
GRAND JURYMEN
Arrested on Dr. Ra
gan's Warrant.
CHARGED WITH EXTORTION
THE DIRECTOR ACCUSED OF
SOLICITING A BRIBE.
Ancient School Board History Is
Thrashed Over Before the Grand
Jury â Investigation Re
sumed To-Night.
The much looked for ex-teacher of the
Business Evening School, D. E. Stanton,
materialized at the City Hall yesterday
afternoon, and for an hour was on the
carpet before the Grand Jury telling
again his story of the alleged bribe
taking of School Director Ragan. Stan*
ton left Los Angeles, where he has been
teaching for some months past, on Satur
day, and arrived in this city on Sunday
evening, but he did not make his presence
known until yesterday when he appeared
voluntarily before the Grand Jury to
assist with the knowledge which he
claims to have in the investigation which
the jury is making Into School Board
affairs.
He was not allowed to remain long in
peace. The particular object of his attack
before the Grand Jury was Dr. Ragan.
He came all the way from the southern
city to tell again how Dr. Ragan had
demanded $300 of him as the price of the
position he sought in the Business Even
ing School, and of the $G0 he alleges was
given him by Jack O'Brien with which
to flee from the wrath that was to come
out of the expose of School Board crook
edness last February. But Dr. Ragan
had a little score of his own to settle
with the versatile Mr. Stanton and as
soon as he heard of his arrival in town
he appeared before Justice of the Peace
Barry, how acting for Police Judge Con
lan, and swore to a complaint charging
the pedagogue with a felony, to wit, at
tempt to extort money.
The resultant warrant was served upon
Stanton as he emerged into the corridor
haV f n f given t0 the Grand Ju ry the
weight ot his testimony, and he accom
panied the police officer who made the
At Vh c <m ' nh l} l \ resistance or complaint.
At the City Prison he was booked upon
the cnarge in the complaint and was given
a chair nstead of a cell In which to await
the arrival of Judge Belcher, who had
announced on the previous day that he
would release him upon his own recogni
zance. It was fully an hour before the
Judge wan notified and another before
he arrived and sent the prisoner out into
the open air.
Dr. Ragan denies that his complaint is
made for any frivolous reason or to pre
vent Stanton from presenting any knowl
edge he. may have to the Grand .lurv
He says, on the contrary, that ht^ has let
ters and telegrams to prove his charges
and will prosecute them. One of the tele
grams upon which he places most reli
ance is dated at Vancouver, Washington
and is worded a* follows: "Two forty or
San Quentin; see relatives immediate!'
or I return. Well bucked witnesses sixty
dollars transaction." It means that after
Stanton fled to Vancouver he found him
self in need of money and threatened to
use his alleged knowledge of Dr. Ragan's
career unless he gave up enough to make
life easier.
After the jury had adjourned to this
evening it was learned that Stanton's
story differed in no wise from the ainda
vits he made when the case was nrst
opened, all of which have been thoroughly i
aired in the newspapers.: His story is by I
no means so connected as at that time,
and he became badly tangled when put
on the witness-stand. The only other
Witness examined was his nephew,
Charles Freedeman, who accompanied
him to this city from Los Angeles
Freedeman roomed with him before lie
was Suspended from the Evening School,
and the evidence he gave yesterday was
corroborative of Stanton's. Both Stanton
and Kilpatrick will appear before the jury
again when it meets this evening.
DIRECTORS CANNOT PAY.
School Creditors Must Await
the Court's Injunction.
The fig-ht between merchants, contract
ors, laborers and school teachers for the
gold remaining in the coffers of the
School Department is on in earnest and
the teachers have drawn first blood. The
teachers are determined that the nefari
ous acts of the School Board shall not
deprive them of their legal salaries, while
those who have labored in behalf of that
august body and merchants who have
furnished material and merchandise are
equally anxious to collect. But one thing
is certain, the present board will not
have the pleasure of paying claims of any
nature now due and payable.
At the instance of Elisha Brooks, a duly
appointed teacher in the Girls' High
School, Presiding: Judge Belcher issued an
injunction yesterday, morning prohibiting
the authorization and payment of claims
against the School Department amount
tary features of the bill would cause men
who shaved themselves or allowed hir
sute appendages to accumulate on their
faces to patronize the barbers, and busi
ness would therefore Improve. Becoming
heated in his argument he moved the
adoption of a section compelling individ
uals whose countenances are now adorned
with "spinach" to have it removed forth
with, but it was declared to be against
the constitution.
After a thorough discussion the I*ll was
ordered referred to a competent attorney,
and after revision It will be presented to
the next Legislature. The question Is of
Â§reat import to -the 3000 barbers in the
tate.
After the meeting adjourned one of the
members said that he would move at the
next meeting to incorporate the following
in the act in order *o prevent official cor
ruption:
"That it shall be unlawful for the Board
of Examiners to accept a free shave from
any barber and that each shall be required
to have and pay for an egg shampoo at
least three times a week."
ing to $102,070. The matter was set for
hearing on January 6, four days after the
incumbent board shall have quit office.
In the complaint in which Elisha j
i,r,"" ks appears as plaintiff and Auditor !
\\ 111 am Broderick, Superintendent of
Schools Webster, Treasurer Christian
Keis and all merchants', contractors and
laborers having claims against the School
Department as defendants, it is recited
that the amount of money appropriated j
v , city government for the public '
schools during the fiscal year of 189S-99 :
was $1,232,040; that most of this amount
has been expended; that the petitioner's
salary for the month of November,
amounting to $250, is due and unpaid and |
lr defendants' claims are honored the res
idue of the fund will be exhausted and
petitioner will be deprived of his salary.
It is further alleged by Professor
Brooks that defendants' claims have been
passed and approved by the" board; that
Superintendent Webster threatens to sign I
them. Auditor Broderick to audit them !
and Treasurer Reis to pay them, which,
he avers, will result in irreparable dam
age to him, and hence the proceedings.
In the prayer it is asked that the de
fendants, other than the officials, be re
strained from asserting, advocating or
demanding the payment of their claims
and that the defendant officials be en
joined from approving, auditing or pay
ing the same.
On the filing of the petition Judge Bel
cher issued a temporary restraining or
der and assigned the cause for hearing
in Judge Seawell's department of the Su
perior Court oÂ« the 6th prox. Mean
while the deendants are forbidden to take
any action regarding the claims and the
School Board must stand idle while its
last days come and go.

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. Dec. 19.â The stock market
moved irregularly an>l resulted in mixed
changes in prices. The genral market had a
good undertone, but was devoid of interesting:
' Jeatures. Little was done In the standard
stocks and the industrials, except sugar, which
broke nearly four points and rallied fraction
ally. The confirmations of the report that Sec
retary and Treasurer Searles would retire owing
to ill health was used in depressing sugar.
Central Pacific was strong in anticipation of
a reorganization plan which expected to follow
any settlement which the company may make
â with the Government. Southern Pacific, which
would beneiit in any favorable development in
Central Pacific, rose 3 points. Prices were well
ii-i'l until the last hour, when there was a
break in Atchison and the Grangers. Trad
ers worked for a decline on the theory that
t-uch a movement was usual before the Christ
mas ilidays. Active bulls professed gratifi
cation at utinuance of outside interest In the
market, which was reflected in the undue prom
lnenc- of sales of the minor stocks in the trad
ins. Tennessee Coal and Iron became strong
and moved up 2 points, and the rest of the
list sympathized in this movement fraction
ally, and the market left off firm.
Operations in railway and â  miscellaneous se
curities were attended with the same aggres
sive show of strength which has characterized
the dealings for some time. Business was
mewhat below recent totals and a general
diversion of interest in securities not usually
prominent. T"tal sales, $5,310,000.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Dec. With plenty of bull
news to encourage buyers, wheat started strong
and in good demand at an advance of %@%e.
May at 67%<g67%c. A few small-sized lots were
disposed of almost immediately at 67% c. The
big factor was the strength at Liverpool. That
market, considering the weakness developed in
I the Chicago market Saturday, showed a some
| what surprising degree of firmness, advances
I ranging from U to % being recorded. Accom
panying the Liverpool quotations were reports
of continued rains In Argentine. Later on
estimates of the exportable surplus of that
country placed the amount at but 30,000,000
busheis and said the quality would be poor.
General rains were also reported in the winter
wheat belt of this country. World's shipments
showed a marked falling off from last week,
the total being placed at 7,397,000 bushels. The
â harp opening advance provoked a lot of re
| alizing, and under this the market \eased off
! to 67% c, where the market held for some time.
I About 11 o'clock the market weakened on the
enormous increase in stocks at Buffalo, which
caused a complete overturning of the calcula
tions as to the visible supply. As a result of
this, visible increase was placed at 3,821.000
bushels, a small decrease having been looked
for. A break of HiSVic occurred in consequence.
But before noon the market had again turned
strong and remained so for the balance of
thÂ» session. Toward the -close the. market was
helped by the excellent local cash business,
sales of 25.000 bushels all-rail shipment being
reported. A good deal of the early realizing
and the short selling was caused by the
heavy northwest receipts, 1495 cars. Rumors
that the visible fipurns w?re incorrect ; also
h'lped late In the session. May rallied to
67%fi?67"6c and closed at G7%Â«?67%c.
Wet weather was the principal influence in
corn. That market, though not very active,
ruled firm and higher all day. May closed %c
higher .at 35% c.
Onts were firm and slightly higher, principal
ly In sympathy with corn. May closed at 26^4c.
Hog prices and the tone of grain markets
favored buyers of provisions. Although pack
ers, and local longs sold liberally .it times,
offerings were well taken and prices were
maintained. At the close May pork was un
changed: May lard a shade higher, and May
ribs a shade lower.

Judge Wofford Finally Scratched In.
Bey del Tierra Enjoyed Him

Sprinter.
Drizzling rain, an unfriendly fog bank
and splashy mud, all conspired to make
the sport at Ingleskle uninteresting: yes
terday. Added to this. La Goleta, the one
big "cinch" of the day. was laid away
to rest, and thereafter the scanty batch
of people In dance fumed, fretted
and appeared altogether disconsolate.
Four choices did win, but this fact did
not atone for this one stupendous upset.
1-H Goleta. the chipper daughter of
Amigo, carried the Santa Anita colors and
â¢was an cdd.s on favorite for the owners'
handicap, with Charley Gray on her back.
Pitted against her were: Moringa, rid
den by Devin, and Ed Purser's aged geld
ing, Buckwa, piloted by "Skeets" Martin.
Christmas money galore was to have been
made on the popular choice. When the
barrier -was released. Buckwa beat it
away a couple of lengths and led the
favorite for over half the distance. Then
the mare went to the front. "When the
straight for home was reached, Gray
made a fatal mistake, which Devln oh
Moringa lid not overlook. He allowed
the latter to take the path and in a fu
rious Irive was beaten the shortest of
h^-ads in the fast time of 1:42'/J. The win
ner was as good as 4 to 1 in the betting.
The other events were very common
place. Judge Wofford, ridden by Johnny
Itoiff. and a 2 to 1 favorite, experienced
no great difficulty in winning the open
ing lle run from Gratify, second choice
In the betting. The balance of the start
ers, aside rom McFarlane, were a poor
lot. â¢
With a snow-plow attachment, the fa
vorite Elldad tnlght have captured the
mile and a quarter Belling affair, but un
der no other conditions. Lady Hurst,
â¢with Spencer op. made all the running
and won with nothing to spare. Martin
on Major Hooker took care of the favor
ite the entire route, and led the latter
out four gtha for the place.
The mile selling run was somewhat of a
pift for the favorite Rey del Tierra, Pur
eer's horse, with Eddie Jones in the sad
dle, was all the best, and won at leis
ure. In a hard drive Spencer on Myth
downed Martin on David Tenny a neck
for second place.
Fog obscured a view of the last two
events. -Don't Tell, favorite for the
maiden two-year-old number, won easily
from Racivnn. and in the final six-furlong
pprint Lodestar beat a fair bunch of
sprinters. Stemler's gelding closed favor
ite in the betting.

old price is given the poor, deluded un
fortunate who buck? their game, and if
a â¢â¢kick" is registered the automatic
usher is called Into requisition and the
recalcitrant player is made acquainted
with tho daylight. These barnacles,
whoso thieving proclivities tend to pros
titute the turf, should be summarily
squelchod.
Jockey Spencer did not care to ride
Lady Hurst, thinking she wouldn't do and
that he would come in incrusted with
mud. John Weber, the mare's trainer,
complained to the judges, and Spencer
rode out his engagement. This is really
too bad. Before Spencer went East he
was willing to ride a 100 to 1 shot and eat
mud. If he has become such a hothouse
plant, the tall rider should wait until the
spring time comes again, with its hopes,
with Ita over-fragrant perfume of the
wild flower.
Harney Schreiber backed Judge Wof
ford on the outside.
Billy Randall , the popular Montana
turfmfin, accompanied by Frank McMahon,
owner of Pat Morrissey, left for Great
Falls on Sunday. The duo will spend

returning here in a couple of weeks.
Fog must ctrtainly have enshrouded the
judge's stand, completely enveloping it,
during the progress of the mile and a
quarter event. If such tactics are permis
sible as were used to defeat Elidad, then
Bullman should be reinstated and resti
tution made to that rider tor the loss he
hajl sustained by being kept out of the
paddle. It has been claimed that preju
dice figured strongly in the suspension of
Builman. and it begins to look as if such
were really the rase. It Is unnecessary
to state what those tactics were. They
were plain to every spectator who can
distinguish a vegetable garden windmill
from a crthle-house flywheel. The dwin
dling popularity of the local track has
received fresh Impetus during the meeting
now In progress.

Evidence of Suicide.
John Fiske, a trooper of Battery B,

the Coroner's office yesterday and said
that he had a conversation with Miss
Klaiber last Friday night and she told
him that she was unable to ]>ay her room
rent and that she intended to commit sui
cide. This is evidence against the meory
that the woman was robbed and murdered
in Golden Gut*' i'ark, where her body was
found last Saturday.

THE SAÂ«" FKA^tTSCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 20, 1898.
TWO CLEVER PUGILISTS.
Martin Denny, the clever Australian 133-pound pugilist, -will meet the
local champion, Sammy Maxwell, in a contest of twenty rounds in
Woodward's Pavilion next Thursday evenicig. Maxwell is in splen
did condition, having trained hard for three weeks at Blanken's Six-
Mile House. Denny is being looked after by Jimmy Anthony, and
if appearance counts for anything he certainly should give a
first-class account of himself. The contest gives promise of being
very interesting. The preliminaries consist of ten-round bouts be
tween Tom Murphy and Billy Hogan and Billy Finnerty and Wil
liam Cole.
WILL ORGANIZE A NEW
BASEBALL LEAGUE
CALIFORNIA CLUB MAGNATES
DISSATISFIED.
"Jack" Bonnet to Be President and
Henry Harris Manager of the
Proposed Organisation.
Plans Outlined.
If present plans dÂ° not miscarry, a new
r-ra in the history of baseball in Cali
fornia will be inaugurated with the open
ing of the season of 18W. That the pres
ent loose methods of changing schedules
ami transferring players, with a superflu
ity of clubs in San Francisco, has been
the cause of a great deal of dissatisfac
tion, is a matter of general knowledge
and the sport has undoubtedly suffered
in consequence. The fault Is laid at the
doors of the present league management
and it is doubtful if the organization, as
It at present exists, could command the
support of the public for another season.
This opinion is shared by nearly, ii" not
quite, all the clubs comprised in the Cali
fornia Baseball League, and they have
decided on an entirely new deal.
Representatives of the San Joso. S
ramento, Santa Cruz, WatsonvUle
Stockton Baseball cluba held a confer
ence with prominent promoters of the
sport in this city during the past week,
when ii was decided to form a new l
in which a certain element of the man
agement of the present league should
have no voice. Jack Bonnet, who â 
no introduction to the lovers of ba
in San Francisco, has been tendered the
presidency of the new organization and
has accepted. Mr. Bonnet has been serv
ing as treasurer of the California Lt-ague,
but has had little voice in its sk.
ment. Henry Harris, equally well known
as a successful promoter of the sport, has
been induced to re-enter the field aa the
manager of the new league. With such
a team the success of the project is as
sured from the start.
All the cities represented at the confer
ence have agreed to put strong clubs in
the field and keep them there through
out the season, with the possible excep
tion of Stockton. There Is little doubt,
however, but what Stockton will come in.
Fresno baseball enthusiasts are alsu anx
ious to be represented in the new league
and have promised to organize a team
that will be able to hold its own with
any.
The plans Include new and larger
grounds to be secured in this city in a
convenient locality, which will be put in
first-class condition for the opening of the
season. The uncertainty that has char
acterized the game during the season
just closing will be entltrely done away
with. In the first place, the new league
will have ample backing financially and
will run the game for the sole purpose
of interesting the people in the sport. A
league schedule will be arranged at the
opeiiing of the season which will not be
changed to HUit the convenience of any
club, and the present haphazard man
ner of arranging dates will be done away
with entirely. The details of the new
organization are yet to be perfected, but
enough has been done to warrant the an

BOXING AND POLO CONTESTS.
Events That Will Take Place in the
Amateur Athletic Clubs This
Week.
The California Athletic and Swimming
Club will give an athletic exhibition this
evening at Mowry's Hall. With the ex
ception of the evening, the programme is
not by any means first class. The feature
of the evening's sport will be an eight
round bout between Charley Rochette and
Charley Johnson at 132 pounds. If Ro
chette is in anything like good form he
should win.
The popular Merchants' Athletic Club,
325 Davis street, has announced that on
Wednesday evening it will entertain its
members. The bill of athletic fare reads:
Six-round contests between Jules Tillman
and John Faccini, at 125 pounds; Joe Gall
ardo of Stockton and Young Jeffries of
this city. ..The feature of. the entertain
ment will be an eight-round bout for the
so-called amateur middle-weight cham
pionship between Al Neil of the Princeton
Athletic Club and Joe Reay of the Olym
pic Club, at 152 pounds. As the Mer
chants' Club has invariably given good
boxing shows, it is to be presumed that
the events of Wednesday evening will be
of classic order.
The polo tournament of the Olympic
Club, which will be contested on Wednes
day evening. Is attracting much attention.'
The contestants, or rather the athletes
who have entered, are trained to the hour,
and a good evening's ' entertainment is
looked for. The Excelsior Club has made
extensive arrangements, for its boxing ex
hibition at Woodward's Pavilion Thurs
day evening.
Creedon and Green will meet in the ring
on Friday, the 30th lnst.. under the aus
pices of the National . Club. ,
There Was No Negligence.

from the Pacific Mall Steamship Company
for Injuries sustained by the falling of a
lot of flour. Henry Bingham had a con
tract with the company to load and un
load Its vessels, one clause specifying u^at
the company should furnish power and
appliances. Six slings were provided, and
after an inspection two were discarded.
While a sling- full of flour was being hoist
ed the rope broke and McCall was in
jured. In the lower court McCall ob
tained judgment, which was reversed by
the higher court. The position was taken
that there was no negligence on the part
of either party, for when the slings were
inspected by a competent person there
was nothing to show that there was any
thing the matter with the rope, and the
fact that there was an inspection relieves
the company and contractor.
Schwarzschild a Defendant.
F. J. Schwarzchlld. the well-known min
ing and railroad man, has been sued for
divorce by his wife, who alleges deser
tion a/id extreme cruelty. The couple
were married in this city in IMM, and
lived in Fruitvale. Soon after the mar
riage, Mrs. Schwarzchlld alleges in ncr
complaint, the husband began to abuse
her, and on occasions beat htT. She fur
ther claims that he refused to nrovide her
with suitable clothing and money. She
asks for a divorce, permission to resume
her maiden name, Charlotte Allen, and
alimony and counsel fees. According to
the complaint the defendant is a capital
ist, owning $40,000 worth of real estate in
Alameda County, and interests in the
Tesla Mining Company and the Alameda
and San Joaquin Railway Company.
Judge Mogan Holds the Court.
"v\'hen Judge Mngan opened court yes
terday morning, after making his suc
cessful coup Sunday. Judge-elect Graham
appeartd and desired to know why Prose
cuting Attorney Spinetti was In his court.
Judge Mogan read him the resolution of

The World's Supply of Wheat.
An English expert, | r phesles â  universal
dearth in the wheat supply. He claims that
the wheat producing soil is unequal to the
strain that will be put upon it. Even now
when the food supply of the world is ample,
thousands die because their disordered stom
achs fall to properly assimilate the food they
take. .Hostetter's Stomach Bitters strengthen

WITH FACTS
Oakland May Secure
a Postoffice.
HAS WAITED MANY YEARS
APPROPRIATIONS HAVE OFTEN
BEEN MADE.
Not a Port of Entry in the Country
the Size of Oakland Is Now
Without a Federal
Building.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Deo. 19.
In a few days Congressman Kilborn will
know enough aboui Oakland i" persuade
Congrtss that this city must have an ade
quate Federal building, that Is to >;i>, if
Congress be amenable to pei
Tliis afternoon many city officials, in
cluding the Mayor and several !â¢
merchants ami real estate dealers, met
at the City Hall to prepare a statement
such as Mr. Hllborn has stated he de
sired. A little surjiri.se was expressed
that at this time, after Mr. Hllborn hati
represented this district three times In
Congress, he should Bend for data regard
ing the population, assessment,
street railroads and other facts about
this city. It lias been thought right along
that all this and much more was already
at Washington. However, the m<-n at
to-day's meeting represented all that is
worth knowing about this city, and the
facts to be s.-nt to Mr. i inborn will very
fully cover the question.
Oakland, it is said, is the only port of
entry in the United States of its size in
which there is not a Federal bulding.
The postoflice is located in an out-of-the
way part of town in what was formerly
a furniture store. It is a very third
rate looking office for a city of the size ol
Oakland, and during the past fifteen
years the postoffice has frequently
moved as its business grew. In another
part of town is located tlu> Oakland cus
tom-house, another building which the
Government rents, and which is difficult
to find on account of its being on a side
street. San Jos.-, it was stated, tonog
ago obtained a very handsome postoffice,
but Oakland has always been Bldetracked
just after it has seemed as it her ap
propriation would go through. Several
Times the matter has been almost com
â i. ami a comfortable sum of money
has been put in the appropriation bill.
But the bills have always passed with the
money for Oakland's postoffice left out.
It lias been stated by friends of Mr.
Hilborn that the elimination of the post
appropriation lias been due to the
fact that several magnificent amounts
have been spent by the uovernment on
the Oakland harbor, and there is doubt
less a good excuse in this for waiting so
long for the postoffice. However, it is
now believed that the harbor work can
and money be appropriated by the
â¢,t Congress for the much desired
Federal building.
A LOTTERY TICKET
SEVERS MAN AND WIFE
Mrs. Margaret Farrell Is Granted a
Divorce.
Fortune Smiled Too Unexpectedly I
and Prosperity Proved Too Big
a Burden for This
Family.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Dec. 19.
The troubles of John Joseph Farrell,
which originally commenced with his for
tune in winning $15,000 in a lottery, were j
ended to-day when Judge Greene granted
Mrs. Margaret Parrel! an absolute di
vorce from his father, John Farrell.
Father and son had for several years
eked out an existence at shoe-pegging in
a small shop on Eighth street. One day
the son purrh;isprl a lottery ticket and
won. With the money a fine home was
bought at Grove and Twenty-seventh
streets, besides several other lots.
The unexpected leap into wealth an<
â¢ prosperity came as an ill omen to th
family, for soon the relations betwee
Mr. and Mrs. Farrell became anything bu
harmonious and finally Mrs. Farrell, se\
eral years ago, commenced suit for d
vorce, alleging extreme cruelty as th
ground. Incidentally the plaintiff Joine
the fortunate step-son, John Joseph Far
rell, as a party defendant for a divisio
of the property.
.She claimed that the lottery ticket wa
purchased by father and son jointly am
that therefore she was entitled to a par
of the former's share.
The trial occupied a long time an
proved decidedly interesting, and a decis
ion was looked for during the past tw
or three months.
In granting the divorce decree Judg
Greene allowed plaintiff $10 monthly al
mony, but all of th*Â» r<Â»al <-state was de
clr.red to be the separate property of th
son.

THIS MAN WAS HUNGRY
AND WEARY OF LIFE
FIVE TIMES HE PLUNGED A
KNIFE TO THE HiLT.
Antone Alatoria's Cravings Drove
Him to Seek a Horrible
Death.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Dec. 19.
Gnawing hunger caused Antone Alato
ria, a Mexican, aged 5S years, to plunge
a throe-Inch blade Into his abdomen five
times this afternoon with the hope that
death would relieve him.
Two of the wounds were glancing
s'aphes, but the others entered the ab
dominal cavity, making an operation ne
cessary. This was very cleverly per
formed at the Receiving Hospital by Drs.
Stratum, lluntington, Wilcox, Sill and
Sanborn, assisted by Stewards Tobin and
Borchert.
Alatoria was perfectly conscious when
he was picked up near his home at Third
and Peralta streets this afternoon, though
decidedly weak from loss of blood. His
wife has been an invalid for some time,
and this, together with hunger, led to the
rash act. Moreover, he had long been out
of work, but those who know him speak
of him as an honest, conscientious man.
"I couldn't stand it any longer," whis
p< red the unfortunate man, in broken
English. "My poor wife is sick and we
had nothing to eat the past three days un
til this morning, when a good friend
brought us two loaves of bread."
This would not appease their hunger and
Alatoria decided that his death would
leav<- one 1Â»-hs to care for.
His wounds are considered not necessar
ily fatal, and the surgeons entertain some
hope of his recovery, though his long in
voluntary fasting has left him a very
weak patient.

EVEN AFTER DEATH
STRANGE TESTIMONY AT AN IN
QUEST AT LIVERMORE.
Ole Eikland Was Killed by Striking
His Face Against a Live
Wire.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Dec. 19.
William Nelson told a remarkable story
at the Coroner's inquest to-day at Tesla
into the killing of Ole Eikland by an
electric wire.
Eikland was not killed by grasping the
wire, but he ran into it with his face.
Death was instantaneous, but his com
rades did not know it and could not un
derstand how a dead man could stand on
his feet with his face against a live
electric wire for several minutes. Nelson
testified that he saw Eikland strike the
wire and *.c immediately tried to push
him away. Eikland could not be moved
and Nelson thought he was "asleep,"
meaning shocked. Nelson tried to push
his companion away from the wire half
a dozen times, but could not move him.
He then went to another man and the
two together took Eikland from between
the cars and discovered he was dead.
The deceased was only 23 years old, anc l
from papers found in his possession the
Coroner discovered thai he is the owner
of some water rights in Montana which
are supposed to be of some value.
ROSE UNDER A CLOUD.
Money Collected by the Gamewell
Company i*ot Accounted For.
ALAMEDA, Dec. 19.â T0-day the city
authorities were instructed by the Game
wel! Fire Alarm Company of New York
not to make any further payments on the
company's account to R. A. Rose, who
had been the concern's coast agent up to
within three weeks ago, when he disap
peared from 1-os Angeles under a cloud.
The company sent the city a statement of j
account, showing a balance due of over
$1000 on a contract for a storage .battery
system purchased about a year ago. An i
investigation shows the amount was paid j
to Rose last April.
<;. Alexander W right, a friend of Rose,'
residing in this city, denies the man has j
disappeared, saying: "His wife has been in
constant communication with him during
his absence and has information that he
will certainly be home within a week. His '
jibs, nee arises from his own personal af- !
fairs and not from any desire to conceal
liis whereaoouts from the Gamewell peo
pli ."
Rose and his family formerly lived on
Mozart street, this city, but moved to San |
Francisco about two months ago. Ala- â 
meda will lose nothing by his transac- i
tions. as at the time he collected the i
money in question he was an accredited
agent of the Gamewell company.

EN ROONEY'S DILEMMA
NO PEOPLE LIVE NEAR TO HIS
SALOON-RESTAURANT.
Tens of Thousands Pass His Place
Daily, but None Can Legally
Sign His Petition for
a License.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Dec. la.
Following: the example of many other
counties Alameda has brought suit
against State Controller E. P. Colgan to
recover $104,316 66 claimed to be due on ac
count of fees, charges and commissions
that should be allowed the following
county officials' departments: Auditor,
Assessor, Treasurer and Tax Collector.
The complaint gives in detail the
amounts due each year from 1593, and ror
each year from that time the figures are:
$25,634, $21,227, $21,396, $18,117, $17,942. It is
also stated the Controller has been aske .
to refund this money to the county and
has refused.
At. the meeting of the Supervisors this
morning they were notified that such a
suit had been brought.
Owen T. Rooney, the proprietor of the
saloon and restaurant at the Oakland
Mole, is in a dilemma. The law requires
that when any one applies for a saloon
license his application must be signed by
a stipulated number of residents within
a certain district of the proposed saloon.
Rooney's place of business is at the cx
ii i-ine end of the mole, and there Is not
a single signer available within the re
quired distance or twice the distance re
quired by law. He has therefore done the
next best thing and procured signatures
of people who live in AVest Oakland near
est to the mole. The Supervisors believe
that this fs the intent of the law, and he
will probably be granted his license, al
though the point raised by the law has
never been passed upon.
The question of fixing water rates
In the districts outside of incorporated
towns whs brought up, as it is
every year, and as usual there
was some doubt as to the interpre
tation to be placed on the section gov
erning such procedure. Secretary .1. H.
T. Watkinson of the Contra Costa Water
Company does not desire to go through
the same experience every year, so no
naively suggested to the board that as
District Attorney Snook had been stuoy
lng this matter for eight years, while in
office, he be required to furnish the board
with a report bearing on the statute, so
that the next District Attorney would not
have to cover the same ground.
Mr. Snook was requested to report not
later than next Tuesday morning.

The Council Transacts Important Ac

OAKLAND, Dec. 19.â The edict against

"THE YELLOW DWARF"
PLEASED THE TIVOLI
A LIVELY VEHICLE FOR SOME
FAIRLY GOOD SONGS.
New Bills at the Other Houses of En
tertainment â Mrs. Bates Re
turns to the Alcazar.
"The Yellow Dwarf" appeared to please
the first-night audience and the applause
! was frequent. It is the inconsequent ex
| travaganza so popular in England at
Christmas time and miscalled a panto
j mime, of which there have been so many
i examples at the Tlvoli at all seasons of
j the year. One does not expect to find
much wit in such a piece, and there is
nothing very original or amusing in the
I story told or In the lines, but it serves as
a vehicle for some fairly good songs â the
best of them are of the sentimental kind
âa number of specialties of all kinds,
some pretty ballets, elaborate costuming
! and a great deal of scenery. The manage
ment has spent money lavishly in dress
ing the piece and the chorus girls and
several of the principals are kept busy
changing their costumes. One of th>.- best
sets is the orange grove where the "dance
of the fireflies" makes a very pretty ef
rect
A piece of this kind depends so much on
! the individual efforts of the whole com
i fi.my, and especially of the comedians,
that it takes several nights before it is in
first rate working order, as it affords un
limited opportunities for adding comic
"business," which the Tivoli company
will no doubt soon take advantage of.
â  However, it went fairly smooth for a
j first performance, although several scenes
are capable of being much more worked
up, as, for instance, the boxing bout in
the orange grove, which Mr. Stevens and
! Mr. West could doubtless make very fun
! ny. The appearance of the Yellow Dwarf
and the Fairy Queen and their flight with
tbe lovers also needs elaborating, as it
went very tamely last night, and Mr. Ste
vens will have to get some new material
for his monologue if he expects to make
a hit with it.
The Tlvoli stock sompany, with a few
additions, appears in /"The Yellow
Dwarf." One of the additions is Miss
Iris Maynard, a lady of opulent charms,
who plays the part of the Fairy Queen,
and another is Miss Ida Wyatt, the pre
miere danseuse and maitresse de ballet.
Miss Anna Lichter plays the part of the
usual beautiful princess, and Miss Elvia
Crox that of the fortunate Prince, who
wLns her from threatening suitors. Both
ladies appeared to advantage and had
many opportunities of showing their good
voices. Mr. Pruette, in a female part,
created much laughter, but his comical
ity was more in nis absurd appearance
than in his acting, of which he did very
little; his performance deserves credit for
its freedom from the vulgarity which is
generally inseparable from female im
personations. Mr. Branson in the title
part has not much to do, and the other
principal comedians, Mr. Stevens and Mr.
West, had to create most of their own
opportunities for fun-making. Ineir
song at the end of the second act was one
of the most successful episodes in the
piece and was very well done. Miss An
nie Myers appeared in a bewildering
number of characters, and several others
of the well-known Tivoli people in less
importafit parts.
"The Yellow Dwarf" is good enough to
run through the Christmas holidays, when
people are supposed to be in search of
mirthful theatrical fare. The book is by
Mr. George Lask, and the scenery and
transformation scene by Mr. Oscar L.

California,
1 California.
"O'Brien the Contractor" seems to have
been written especially for Daniel Sully
lie plays the character in his own inim
itable way and scored a success at the
California last night. As the builder of a
road through Rocky Gorge he has staked
his all on its completion, and the manner
in which he triumphed over his foes won
the sympathy of the large audience. He
was ably seconded by his wife, Mrs. Lou
ise Sully, Miss Daisy Chaplin. Jefferson
Lloyd. Harry MeFayden and the remain-,
der of the cast. Baby Ethel is a very
clever child and was one of the features
of the play. "O'Brien the Contractor" will
continue during the week.
Alcazar.
Fred Marston's comedy "Humbug,"
which was written for Roland Reed, was
presented at the Alcazar last night. The
event was marked by the reappearance
of Mrs. F. M. Bates, the Alcazar's favor
ite. She met with a most cordial recep
tion. Several theater parties were pres
ent in her honor. The comedy is well
named. A young man, the son of a shoe
maker, and a young widow, the daughter
of a butcher, meet and te"ll each other of
their noble ancestry. They are married,
and the difficulties they have to surmount
to prevent the inevitable exposure are
provocative of the heartiest laughter. Er
nest Hastings, as Jack Luster, the hum
bug, made quite a hit, and he had a con
genial partner in Miss Maria Howe as
Mrs. Araminda Bertram-Ponsby-Luster.
Mrs. Bates had not much to do as Mrs.
Judge Sham, but what she had she did
well. The other parts were ably sustained

West's Minstrel Jubilee.
The appearance of Millionaire West's
big minstrel jubilee at the Columbia The
ater beginning with a Christmas matinee,
Monday, December 26, promises to be a
rare treat. Mr. West has gathered an
all-star cast to present the artistic side
of minstrelsy. Among the many celebri
ties in this company is Carroll Johnson,
whose fame as a song and dance come
dian is well known to theater-goers. An
other celebrity is Clement Stewart, Lon
don's favorite tenor. His voice has at
tracted the attention of all the critics In
this country. In New York the West com
pany played to the most fashionable au
diences ever seen at a minstrel perform

J. G. EDWARDS'
DEATH DUE TO
AN ACCIDENT
He Was Thrown From
a Car.
NO DAMAGES TO BE ASKED
THE QUESTION OF HIS SUCCES
SOR IS DISCUSSED.
Governor Budd Positively Announces
That the Appointment Belongs
to the Republican
Party.
J. G. Edwards, editor of the Coast Re
view, died at his home In this city early
yesterday morning. Death resulted from
a fracture of his skull. At the last gen
eral election Mr. 'Edwards was elected to
represent the First or San Francisco Dis
trict on the State Board of Equalization,
the position now filled by A. Chesebrough.
Und Mr. Edwards lived he would have
taken the office to which he was elected
on the 2d of January next. Some of the
politicians surmise that Mr. Chesebrough,
holding until his successor shall be elect
ed and quaiiiied, may hold the place until
tne next general election, but the generai
current of opinion is that the Governor
will appoint to fill a vacancy. It was
definitely stated yesterday by Governor
Budd that he would not appoint. Speak
ing with reference to the subject he said:
"Had Mr. Edwards been elected as a
Democrat I would announce my purpose
to appoint some one to take his place on
the State Board of Equalization, but as
he was a Republican I hold that the office
belongs to the Republican party, and,
therefore, I shall leave to the incoming
Governor, Mr. Gage, the question of fill
ing the vacancy."
Dr. Cluness notified the Coroner yester
day that the death of John G. Edwards,
the veteran editor, was caused by a frac
ture of the skull sustained ten days be
fore his demise. An inquest will be held.
At the home of the deceased it was
learned that about 11 o'clock p. m., on
the night of the Bth of this month, Mr.
Edwards boarded a car* at the corner of
O'Farrell and Market streets for home.
When the car was between Powell and
Stockton streets a sudden movement of
it caused Mr. Edwards, who was standing
on the dummy, to fall into the street,
striking directly on his head. He had en
deavored to save himself from falling,/
but owing to a lame arm was unable to
do so. He struck directly on his head,
fracturing his skull. While he was not
rendered uncouscious he was. dazed and
lost all knowledge of his identity. He
was eventually recognized, and with the
assistance of some of the street car em
ployes was taken to his home on Cali
fornia street. The next day paralysis set
In, and in this condition he finally ex
pired.
His relatives will make no claim agains:
the street car company, as they believe
their sad loss was not due to any negli
gence or fault of the employes of the
company. They are inclined to attribute
it to the unfortunate fact that Mr. Ed
wards was suffering from the loss of the
use of one of his arms.

NATIONAL BANK TAXES.
Personal Property Exempt According
to a Supreme Court Dscision.
The Supreme Court has decided in favor
of the defendant in the case of the
Assessor of Sacramento County against
the National Bank of D. O. Mills, an ac
tion brought to recover taxes from the
corporation. In the statement of its man
ager to the Assessor a description was
given of certain real estate, safes and fix
tures, the valuation of which was placed
at $5000. The county officer was dissatis
fied, and the bank employes changed the
statement, omitting the safes and fix
tures, and gave the altered statement to
the Assessor. Still the Assessor was dis
satisfied and he made an arbitrary as
sessment which took in all the property
mentioned. The bank tendered the taxes
on the real estate, but declined to pay on
any of the personal property, claiming
that the same was exempt under the law
creating national banks. The bank re
ceived judgment and the case was ap
pealed.
The contention of the bank was first,
that the assessment was illegal because
the Assessor did not subpena the officials
of the bank for examination as to the
property in dispute. This the higher
court holds to be unnecessary. The sec
ond contention of illegality was that un
der the. national banking act the personal
property, fixtures, safe, etc., are exempt
from taxation, and upon this the judg
ment of the lower court was affrmed.
The point was that Congress had specified
what should be taxed, and the property
under discussion was not on the list.
In the Divorce Courts.
Anna L. McCord was granted a divorce
from Mark McCord yesterday on the
ground of desertion. Myrta Struhel has
sued F. M. Struhel for a divorce, alleging
failure to provide a^ a cause of action.

they are not the kind of husband you want. I shall be gone some months
but I hope you will not miss me. You are a good girl and deserve a good
husband and I hope you will get one." He signed the letter, 'Yours truly
William Ralph.' "âExtract from a statement made by Miss Emma Oliver
to whom Brandes was making love, and on whom he called on the eveninc
after the murder of his daughter.
A sensation was injected into the
Brandes murder case in Oakland yester
day by the appearance on the scene of
Miss Emma Oliver, a young lady who will
probably be one of the principal wit
nesses at the trial in the Superior Court.
On the day of the murder and for some
time previous W. A. Brandes was making
love to Miss Oliver and was actually as
purii-.f,- her that he was a single man with
honorable intentions. He frequently told
the young lady that the bad Berkeley
Brandes was his brother and that he waa
a good man looking for a good wife.
"And he might have killed me, too,"
said Miss Oliver, when she learned the
extent of her false lover's perfidy. The
remarkable story told to-night by the
young lady is one of the strangest chap
ters that ever formed part of a tragedy.
It shows clearly that Brandes was one
of the most perfect of plotters.
Just what his designs were in regard to
Miss Oliver she does not care to contem
plate, but it is probable that if the death
of Lillian had not resulted In the arrest
of her father and stepmother Brandes
would yet be paying his attentions to
the young lady who is only too thankful
that she discovered the truth in time.
The testimony of Miss Oliver knocks
several of the props from under the de
fense of Brandes. He was forced to ac
count for his money to his wife, and as
he was spending It on another than the
ones at home, he accused Lillian of steal
ing it. It required money to make love
and live a dual life, to be the head of a
nciusfhold at Berkeley and to be an
ardent lover in Oakland, and Lillian was
branded as a thief. Whether she took
any money or not, ehe certainly did not
take all that was missing from Brandes'
income, yet she was beaten cruelly for
Stealing it. and from these blows the 13
year-old child now lies in her grave.
Nor did hf cease paying his attentions
to Miss Oliver even while his only daugh
ter, bruised and battered, lay cold in
death, for twelve hours after the girl had
been found hung to her bedpost, Brandes
was making a call and with his icy cold
hand was telling in pitiful tones 6f the
death of his "brothers child" to the girl
to whom he again proclaimed himself a
single man.
Miss Oliver is 20 years old, and in figure
very much resembles Lillian. She Is pe
tite, with a very refined manner, has
a round girlish face and impresses one as
being an impulsive, conscientious girl
She has told her story to her friends and
last evening she repeated it In detail to a
Call reporter. She is at present employed

I take pleasure in letting yon know how
much < rncuÃA Remedies have done for me,
my father and two brothers. In the fall of

was all over my body. I could not sleep but
was compelled to lie awake and scratch all

afflicted with the same thing.at the same time.
We all suffered terribly fora year and a half,
trying in the meantime all the remedies we
could find, but received no benefit. I hap-
pened to see Cctiocra Remedies advertised
and how they had cured others from itching

them. I bought three cakes of Ccticura

"I was introduced to Brandes some
months ago by a friend," said Miss Oli

"He told me his name was Ralph, and
one day I noticed on his star the name
'W. A. Brandes. 1 I asked him who that
was and he said it was the other Brandes.
I was not satisfied and told my mother of
my suspicions, and she said that it would
perhaps be as well if I had nothing more
to do with him. I again asked him if he
were not married and he said no, and
swore positively that he was single.
"On one occasion when he was taking
something out of his pocket an envelope
fell to the ground. I pirke.d it up and
saw on it these words. 'Have pone to call
on Mrs. , your wife.' I told him that
I considered that proof that he was not
telling me the truth, but he told me the
envelope, belonged to his brother and that
it was his wife who had written on it. I
allowed myself to be convinced and con
tinued our friendship. My uncle is Town
Marshal of Pleasanton, and he said he
had heard some very unpleasant things
about Brandes of Berkeley, but wl
told Ralph about It he said It was not h*
but his married brother. Brandes Old do
always like to come to the house when
was at home, so he would stay outside
and whistle In a peculiar manner.
"On the Saturday on which Lillian
Brandes died he came outside our house
in the evening and I heard his peculiar
whistle. I went out to him and saw a
once that he was greatly excited. He
was trembling from head to foot. When
he shook hands I drew back with a start.
He asked me why I did so. I did not
reply for a minute. I had grasped a
hand of ice. It was cold as death, and
clammy. I asked him what ailed him,
and he began to cry like a child and
said there had been a death in his I
brother's family. Then he became so in
tensely dramatic that I was forced to
laugh at him.
"But even after his arrest he attempted
to keen up his deception and to lead me.
tg believe that he was a single man.
He wrote me a letter intended to throw
me off the right track. He said that he
could not call on me for some time, as
he had found It necessary to go East.
His brother, he said, had gotten into very
serious trouble and he was going East
to raise money to help him out. He said
he would be gone some months. He also

ter, 'Yours truly, William Ralph.'
He did not propose marriage to me,
because I did not encourage him, but he
was always impressing on me the fact
that he was single, and I suppose he
would have talked of marriage in time.
\Yhen I learned the truth I could not
help saying to myself, 'perhaps he might

MBS. BRANDES CHEEBFT7L.
Accused Murderess Blossoms Out in
New Attire and Her Demeanor
Changed.
OAKLAND, Dec. 19.â Recent miscar
riages of justice, with an attending hope
of eventual freedom, have apparently had
a decided cheerful effect upon Mrs.
Etta Brandes, who, together with her
alleged husband, is charged with murder
ing their 13-year-old daughter Lillian.
Mrs. Brandes' preliminary hearing was
to have commenced in Justice Olift's
court at 2 o'clock this afternoon, but
owing to the protracted illness of Dep
uty District Attorney Harry Melvin, who
Will have charge of the prosecution, the
I matter went over until Tuesday of next
week.
The accused woman, who has hereto
fore appeared in deep mourning and most
sorrowful countenance, has suddenly ap
peared in an entirely new outfit and
cheerfulness. To-day she was gowned in
a neat-fitting dress of the latest winter
pattern, a light Melton jacket and a white
fedora hat. As Jailer Lane released Airs.
Brandes from the prison corridor to the
outer room. Constable "Weidler was en
gaged for a few moments in the main
office, and the prisoner waited impatient
ly. Finally when Weidler took charge of
her she- remarked most jocularly. "Pshaw,
I thought you were going to let mo walk
â¢ to the courtroom all alone."
In the courtroom she smiled, even
laughed audibly, chatting merrily with
a woman companion, and her entire de
meanor has changed most remarkably.

Police Pension Decisiom.
Joseph Maguire was a policeman, and
wh^n he died th.> administrator of his
estate brought suit against the old Police
Life and Health Insurance Board for
$1000 claimed to be due the estate. The
lower court decided against the estate
and the case was appealed to the Su
preme Court. The Supreme Court af
firmed the decision of the lower court,
holding that Maguire was appointed to
the force before the passage of the act
of ISS9 creating the Police Relief, Health
Insurance and Pension Board. In ac
cepting his position he did so with the
full understanding that the Legislature
had full power to amend the law regula
ting his compensation. This means that
Maguire was appointed while the old
board wm in force, and It was that board
the administrator sued. The act creating
the new board also authorized the old
board to turn its funds over to the more
recent board. Hence there were no funds
at the disposal of the old board, and while
it is not said in so many words the infer
ence is that a suit should have been
brought against the more recent organiza
tion.

Frank A. Turner and his wife came

unable to secure steady employment,

E. D. McCABE IS
THE LUCKY MAN
Governor Budd Appoints His Former
Private Secretary a Building and
Loan Commissioner.
f~*\ OVERNOR BUDD'S appointment of his former secretary, E. D. McCabe,
( as a member of the Building and Loan Commission, which was announced
IT yesterday, is one of the most popular acts of his administration and one
*-** that is certain to give general satisfaction in his own party as well as
among the many friends of Mr. McCabe of other political faiths. They be
lieve he has earned the honor and his friends are confident he will acquit
himself with credit in his new position.
Mr. McCabe was born in Tuolumne County, April 18, 1859. In 1867 his
parents removed to Stanislaus County and young McCabe spent his boyhood
on a ranch. In ISBO he was graduated from University Mound College, in
South San Francisco, and in the following year was appointed Under Sheriff
of Stanislaus County, which position he held for several years. With the
money he had saved while in the Sheriff's office he came to San Francisco
and entered Hastings Law College, from which Institution he was graduated
in 1884. Returning home he was soon after elected clerk of Stanislaus County
and' served one term. He refused to seek a renomination and shortly after
ward removed to Merced, where he formed a law partnership with Hon F
H. Gould, ex-Speaker of the Assembly and at present a member of the Build
ing and Loan Commission. This partnership continued until he was made
executive secretary of Governor Budd In 1895. Upon the retirement of E L
Colnon, the Governor's private secretary. Mr. McCabe succeeded to the po^
sltion, which he held until he was appointed State Librarian, from which
position he was deposed by the Republican trustees a few months ago Since
that time Mr. McCabe has been practicing law in Sacramento. His term as
.Building and Loan Commissioner will expire in four years.
became acquainted with A. H. Merrill,
an insurance solicitor, who was a can
didate for Assemblyman on the Repub
lican ticket from the Thirty-sixth As
sembly district. The acquaintance
ripened into intimacy, and when the
contest at the polls resulted in Mer
rill's election Turner celebrated the
event in becoming fa-shion.
Shortly before Turner's departure for
the East he formed the acquaintance
of a member of the Chronicle's repor
torial staff who, for purposes that will
become apparent, concealed his real
identity under the assumed name of
James Goff. The supposed Goff posed
as a young Philadelphian who was
homesick and without funds. He be
came so friendly with Turner that he
accompanied that gentleman as far as
Port Costa when Tuner and his wife
started tm their trip to New York. All
that passed between the supposed Goff
and Turner during their last inter
view was witnessed by another report
er, whose presence was unsuspected by
the communicative Turner.
The reporter, who shall be known in
this tale as Mr. Goff, expressed a desire
to go home to Philadelphia, but con
fessed to a lack of funds with which
to purchase railroad tickets.
"You can get around that easily
enough," said Turner. "Look at my
wife and myself. We had just $14 be
tween us and not another cent in the
world. But just the same we have two
through tickets to New York."
In proof of his assertion Tuyier dis
played the tickets. They were regular
in form and were signed "G. W. Fletch
er, per A. H. A." After having shown
the evidences of his own good fortune
Turner became confidential.
"I will tell you how I did it and you
can go and do the same thing," he
said. "I went to Assemblyman A. H.
Merrill and told him what I wanted and
he took me down to see Dan Burns.
Merrill told Burns what he wanted and
Burns sent us over to see Bert Worth
ington, who is a confidential clerk in
the employ of the Southern Pacific
Company. "Wort v >inÂ° r ton sent us to see
H. E. Huntington.
"It began to look as If we were go
ing to be kissed off all around, for
Huntington mumbled something about
not wanting the political department
of the railroad mixed up in his end of
the business. He finally told us to go
back to Burns and get him to give us
a note to Herrin.
""We went back to see Burns again
and he pulled Merrill off to one side and
they had a little private conversation
that I could not hear. Affer they had
fixed it up Merrill and I went to see
Herrin. When Herrin got the mes
sage that Merrill gave him he told us
to sit down and wait a few minutes.
We did so and pretty soon a clerk came
in and handed Herrin an envelope,
which he handed to Merrill. When we
got outside Merrill gave me the en
velope and in it were the tickets to
New York for myself and wife. I felt
pretty good about it and told Merrill
so.
"He told me not to mention it, an
he had the Southern Pacific Com
pany where he wanted it. I axkrd
him what he save in exchange for
the tickets, and he said that that
irai a matter between himself and
hi* maker. I asked him which
maker, and he Raid he guessed it
was his political maker."
Just before the train bearing Goff
and Turner reached Port Costa Turner
gave Goff the following note addressed
to Merrill:
A. H. Merrill, Esq.â Dear Friend:
This will introduce Mr. J. Goff, a friend
of mine from Philadelphia. If you can
fix him with a pass do so. Here is an
other chance for you to show your
fighting qualities. Yours,
F. A. TURNER.
Two days later this letter of introduc
tion and recommendation was present
ed to Mr. Merrill in person by Mr. Goff.
After reading it Merrill said:
"Turner is a good fellow, but I am
afraid I have done all I can. I had a
hard pull to get tickets for him and I
don't want to go at them again so
soon. I can't go direct to the railroad.
I tried it last time and got turned down.
Huntington fired me back on Burns.
"You nee," continued Merrill,
"Bnrnn In doing; all of the political
end of the free paNK bunlnenH now.
I think it Ti-ill be hard for me to Rit
more pamieH ion. Yon nee, I tied up
my vote for Senator on the flrwt
proposition, and they don't need to
so ont of their way to favor me
iiKiiln just now."
Merrill then asked if Goff knew any
of the "boys" in the Thirty-sixth dis
trict. Upon receiving an affirmative re
ply he said:
"Get them to go to Senator Burnett;
he can help you out In a minute. Men
tion my name. Tell him it is dead easy
and if he wants to know how to work
it tell him to telephone me and I win
put him on. All you've got to do is to
be a good fellow to Burns.
"Hold on a minute, though. Perhaps
it will be better If you do not mention
my name. You can say a Republican
Assemblyman told you about it. Oh,
well; I don't know; mention my name
anyway; If Burnett don't feel right
about it any other Assemblyman or
Senator can work it for you. You see,
it is probable that several of them have
not worked the pass business yet. They
can get in in a minute if they feel like
going up against it.
"You tell them that there is one thing
sure and that is that it is Burns they
will have to go to first or the Southern
Pacific people won't listen."
Later in the day Goff went back to
Merrill and told him that the "boys"
said he (Merrill) could get more trans
portation if he cared to ask for it.
Merrill, however, refused to "go up
against it," as he expressed it and there
the conversation ended.
TO BRING ROSSEB BACK.
The Grand Jury Will Examine Into
the Shooting at Young Walsh.
The Grand Jury will be asked to in
quire into the shooting at Willie Walsh
by the "dazed" and drunken Walter Kos
ser, who was recently acquitted of tne
murder of Henry Hildebrand in the
Spreckels Market. At the time that Ros
! ser shot and killed Hildebrand he fired a
shot at young Walsh. It is for this of
fense that the Grand Jury will try to in
dict him.
Should he be indicted a requisition will
be asked for his return to this city to
stand trial. A conviction on the charge
of shooting with intent to commit mur
der is punishable witr^ twenty years in
State prison.
Chief of Police Lees will collect all the
evidence at his disposal and submit it to
the Jury as soon as possible, in order tfcat
the young man with a predilection for
drugs may be brought back to this city
and made to pay at least part of tne
price of his bloodshed. The police author
ities say that had they thought for one
moment that the District Attorney's of
fice would have made guch a weak
prosecution of the murder, a sec
ond charge of assauTt to murder
would have been lodged against Rosser
That precaution was not taken for tne
reason that it was never dreamed by the
police that an acquittal would result on
the more serious charge.
