VOLUME LXXXIII.-NO. 48.
LOS ANGELES NOW UP IN ARMS!
Its People Determined to
Break the Clutch
of the Water
Company.
Mayor Snyder and a Minority of
the Council Standing by
Their Pledge.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 16.â A grave
Question has arisen. Shall a water
company rule this city? The present
year will witness an eventful struggle
to determine this point. No more im
portant contest than the one to be
waged between an entrenched capital
and the taxpayers has yet l>een record
ed' in local history, and the outcome
must directly Interest every one of the
110,000 residents. Nevertheless, the peo
ple who recognize the fact that their
rights are in danger, that a corpora
fattened on their generosity, is
loth to relinquish its grip, are obliged
to turn to San Francisco to find a daily
paper bold enough to champion their
cause.
Almost as a unit the people of Los
Angeles, taxpayers and voters, favor
public ownership of a water-distribut
ing plant. This statement Is not ad
vanced as an estimate. It is simply
declan <1 as truth, for the people have
directly indicated their wishes at the
ballot-box.
It will be thirty years on the 22d of
next July since the city of Los Angeles
entered into a contract with private
parties to take from the management
of the little adobe town of 1868 the
â water works plant, then owned by the
municipality, and to conduct and oper
ate it for thirty years.
To these private partiesâ now known
as the Los Angeles City Water Com
pany â the City Council of the later six
ties gave the use of the water of the
Los Angeles River for the period
above stated, the same to be distri
buted for public purposes.
According to the terms of the lease,
it was provided that at the expiration
of the contract the plant of the water
company should once more become the
property of the city, the company to
be paid at a fair and equitable figure
for all improvements made thereto.
When this contract was entered into
and this lease made, the city of Los
Angeles had a scattered popula
tion of a few thousands. No one for
one moment thought that at the ex
piration of the lease there would be
here the second city In size and com
mercial importance west of the Rocky
Mountains. But such is the case, and,
as the city has grown, bo. has the re
muneration of the original holders of
that valuable lease, their heirs and
assigns.
Under this private direction and con
trol the city and its people have for
thirty years been put to a very heavy
tax for water Bupply. The water com
pany has had a monopoly and has been
enabled to place a burden upon the peo
ple which they have been forced to
bear, complaints being futile. Accord
ing to the rates now in force, and they
have been reduced year by year for
Borne rlx or seven years, there is an an
nual profit of $400,000 accruing to the
stockholders of the water company.
The citizens have long realized this
but In a good-natured way they have
borne their burden almost without
murmur. They had to. But they had
ail the time one bright ray of hope In
the future. In 1898 the lease, franchise
all rights of the water company
were lapsed by the contract and the
property reverted to the city. Then a
greater era would dawn. People could
have all the water they desired for
household and other purposes and It
would be furnished to them by the city
direct, at the simple cost of distribu
tion, which would be exceedingly light.
All agreed that when this time arrived
their troubles as to water would be
over.
The water contract that was made In
lobe days of Los Angeles has be
come an historical document, and it is
Inly a most extraordinary paper.
It is given in full, as follows:

The Mayor of the City Advocates a Plan of
Acquiring the Plant.
To the Editor of The Callâ Sir: Who shall supply the In
habitants of the city of Los Angeles with water, the city itself
or the City Water Company? This is -i question that has been
agitating the minds of the citizens of this city for a lons time,
and this agitation has been growing greater and greater with
the general advancement of the city. For nearly thirty years
the City Water Company under a lease, has been in absolute
control of the system for distribution of water for domestic
purposes. The members of the present municipal administra
tion were elected on platforms declaring unreservedly for. the
ownership and operation by the city of the water plant. All
the officeholders were sleeted by large majorities, the: people
believing them thoroughly in sympathy with the great cause.
Twelve months have elapsed, and but little has been accom
plished. Every effort on my part and on the part of others
to bring about a settlement of the controversy has been're
ferred to by certain members of the administration as "gallery
play." and our sincerity has been otherwise questioned by these
people. Procrastination in all matters relating to water supply
is the only "action," if such term applies, that escapes criti
| cism. There are some who seem to be doing nothing more than
to look for stumbling stones to place in the way. It appears to
me as if the water company were exerting every effort to ar
range things so that it may continue in possession of the plant
after the expiration of the lease.
In the month of July of this year the lease h.tween the city
and the City Water Company will expire, SO it will be seen that
there remains only a short time in which to act T do not want
to be understood as advoenting the position taken by some few
citizens that the water company bus absolufc ly no rights In the
controversy. I contend, to the contrary, that the water com
pany under the thirty-year lease with the city has certain
moral, if not legal, rights, which must be respected; and I also
contend that the city has certain rights which must and which
Bhail be respected by the water company.
There is only one logical solution of the problem. I stated
It In my annual message to the <'ity Council. It Is as follows:
"In the event that tho city should, jift.-r having <l<.n. â  every
thing in Its pnw.-r, fail to bring about a settlement, there Is but
one course to pursue that cannot be evaded ly the water com
pany. At the expiration of the thirty-year contract the city. If
Its Interests are to be protected, take possession of the entire
plant of the water companyâ reservoir, pipes. In short, every
thing that goes to form the system. No one should for a mo
ment question the city's right to this course. There is not â¢

one year from the date hereof place a

Into the possession of the city at the expiration of the thirty
ycr contract; but the contract fioes Bay that the water com
pany will mnko all Improvements as mentioned and set forth

of the said pert* d of thirty years in good order and condition,

city of Los Angeles not being Insolvent, the water company
could in duo timo recover all it is entitled tv for improvements
under th<- contract. I consider Uie Water company acting sim
ply in the capai Ity of trustee, and that acting as such the com
pany lias absolutely nothing to Bay about operating the plant
after the expiration of the contract. By terms of the contract
the plant reverts to the dtjr. All the water company his is
a claim on the city for the real value of the improvements
wit during the 1 i r.Â» of the contract. There Is
no doubt that nearly thirty years ago when the Mayor and
Common Council of the city of Los Angeles entered into con-
With the water company, it was never intended (and if it
had been Intended it would have been expressly provided in the
tract) that the water company should at the expiration of
the contract hare any rights in the premises except to the
real raloe of the Improvements.
The press dispatches made it appear that in my annual
ffe I advocated confiscation and other anarchistic meas
ures. T have not tsid a word about confiscation. Why should
I? The water plant is the property of the city of LOS Anp.-1.-s.
and under the contract all that the city has to no is to pay
for the Improvements. I believe that the City Water Company,
after having made millions of dollars out of a privilege granted
by the city and for which it paid nothing, should be philan
thropic enough to assist rather than obstruct the efforts at an
early settlement.
It is a plain case. Kither th<* city or the water company is
to rule. If the city doesn't demand Its rights, the rock of ages
will crumble away before we are any nearer municipal owner

In conch rmit me to say that I am standing
firmly on the platform upon which I was elected. I am exert
ing every effort to bring about a fair, just settlement of the
question at issue, and I shall continue to do so while in tsa

PRESIDENT SANFORD B. DOLE.
TO FURTHER
THE CAUSE OF
ANNEXATION
flrrival of President Sanford B.
Dole of the Hawaiian Govern
ment as an Err)bassador
to Washingtor).
After a stormy passage from the Is
lands, and nearly four days overdue,
the Peru slipped in through the fog
last night, and just before 9 o'clock
dropped anchor off Melggs wharf.
There had been some anxiety as to
her welfare, but she arrived with all
well, and bearing the President of the
island republic, Sanford B. Dole.
President Dole Is in a hurry. He
will stay no lÂ«inger in San Francisco
than possible, and then he will speed
on to Washingtonâ for Washington is
his goal and Congress is his object, and
his mission the cause of annexation.
Doles arrival just now is particular
ly significant, for the question of an
nexing the Hawaiian Islands is now be
fore the Senate, and the presence of an
embassador no meaner than the head of
the Provisional Government itself
shows how deeply * concerned the an
nexationists are in regard to the fate
of their favorite project.
President Dole will appear before the
committee on foreign relations in the
furtherance of his mission, and his
hopes reach to a hearing before the
bar of the Senate itself, should such a
course be allowed. At any rate, he
comes armed with all the weapons of a
diplomat, and the fight against the au
tonomy of the island government will
be a bitter one.
President Dole is accompanied by his
wife and daughter, both of whom will
continue on East with him.
Dr. Rosenau, the Federal quarantine
officer, whose Jurisdiction in the matter
of inspecting foreign vessels has been
decided by the courts, followed his
usual custom in the case of the Peru.
He made no effort to allow the passen
gers to land, having had no Instruc
tions from Washington to waive the
usual custom.
Drs. Chalmers and Hill, however.
State officers, accepted an invitation to
become reporters for the yellow journal
on Mission street, though they failed In
tatlve that they had made their late
trip through the rain for the benefit of
the press. A singular fatality over
took them, for but one paper received
any intimation that the doctors were
losing their time for the benefit of news
in general.
The ship's officers said that they did
not know that the doctors were act
ing as reporters.
It was learned from both doctors and
from Mr. George Hooper, who accom
panied the yellow paper's tug, that not
anyone of the party was allowed to see
President Dole and that the reporter
was not allowed to leave his tug. Drs.
Hill and Chalmers were very eager to
have the papers denounce Dr. Rose
nau for not allowing the President to
land, though he seems to have stuck
closely to his line of duty, refusing to
lend himself to yellow methods.
The extent of the anxiety felt for
the Peru can be best Judged by the
comparative silence of the Merchants'
Exchange telephone. It has kept up a
constant jingle since the ship was due,
the racket increasing in proportion as
the hours flew by and the ship was
still unsighted. It took the full time of
one man just to answer queries about
the vessel.
President Dole was not the only one
for whom a welcome was prepared.

This contract United States District
Judge Olin Wei bom has decided is
le~al and binding as to both parties.
THE POPULAR IDEA.
It Was That by the Middle of
July of This Year All Was
to Be Settled.
It will be noted that the agreement
which is so fully set forth provided
and evidently contemplated municipal
ownership of the water plant of the
city at its expiration.
Anyway, the people have for the last
ten years always so regarded it.
When the municipal campaign of 1896
opened the voters of the city realized !
that the public servants chosen at the
December election of that year and j
taking office on the first Monday in '
January of 1897 would be called upon
to adjudicate the question of municipal
ownership of the plant. The Council
men chosen would go to make up the
legislative body of the city. The
Mayor, the head of the corporation,
would have the power to veto all acts
of the Council. The City Attorney
would >>c the legal adviser of the Coun
cil and Mayor, while the City Engineer
would be the expert relied upon for
knowledge and information concerning
the water company's plant.
All political parties declared in favor
of. municipal ownership, and the indi
vidual candidates vied with each other
ing who could carry out the idea
that ho was and always had been in
favor of the city furnjpninpr its inhabi
tants at the cost of distribution the
water which it was admitted the muni
cipality owned.
The water company also had inter
ests at stake in the campaign and the
corporation through its agents en
deavored to play some very clever
(schemes whereby the people would be
deluded. It succeedf-d. Perhaps not
before the election, but it certainly did
afterward.
The corporation realized that its
very life was involved in the result of
lection; and, as 'well, a matter of
anywhere from a million and a half to
two millions of dollars. The work it
did was under cover and was under
stood only by those who were close to
its directing Bpirita.
Herculean efforts wore put forth by
the water company to defeat M. P.
Snyder for Mayor. It was fruitless.
He was elected by 1600 majority.
In the matter of City Attorney and
City Engineer the candidates who were
endeavoring to beat each other were
none of them objectionable to the
water company save J. R. Rush, who
; ran for City Attorney. He was de
feated.
But it was in the Council that the
j water company got in its finest work.
Four Republicans and four Democrats
j were elected. The L .gue for Better
; City Government elected one Council
i man, and he had the deciding vote in
! the Council. This was Herman Silver,
i the member from the Fourth Ward.
There was considerable speculation
about the organization of the Council.
Mr. Silver settled it by combining wi '\
the Republicans, ar " he was chosen
president of the Council. It was by
this clever move that the Republicans
were ostensibly enabled to organize the
Council, but really Mr. Silver and the
League for Better City Government
are responsible for the present admin
istration of the affairs of the city. The
Mayor is like the fifth whe 1 to a cart
so far as concerns his legal power to
do or undo what the Council docs.
When President Silver appointed the
important Committee on Water Supply
he named F. M. Xickell. a Demo< pal
as chairman. This -was regard*
extraordinary â that rader the circum
stances a Democrat should be n "ned
for that committee, which would have
all to do with the settlement of the
water question.
The friends of municipal ownership
then and there began to realize that
once more the people had been deceived
and that the prospects for an equitable
settlement of the problem were becom
ing dim.
Time passed on, and, under extraor
dinary pressure from the people, the
Council took one limping step after
another, but no move seemed to bring
any nearer the great desideratum of
municipal ownership.
In the meantime, for reasons which
must have been substantial, but which
are not known to the average citizen,
three of the daily papers of the city â
the Times, Herald and Express â be
came silent on the water question. If
they had anything to say it was in
condemnation and denunciation of
those public servants who were en
deavoring to carry out their ante-elec
tion pledges, solemnly made to the
people. Shafts of ridicule were hurled
at the Mayor and at the two Council
men who were endeavoring to do what
they considered to be their duty to
their constituents.
It soon became apparent that the
three daily newspapers named were
syndicated for the purpose of delaying
if not to entirely defeat municipal
ownership.
All efforts to get the water committee
of the Council to do anything effective
were fruitless. It held infrequent meet
ings at unknown times, but what it
has ever done to hasten municipal
ownership no man knoweth.
FIGURES OBTAINED.
The City Engineer Directed to
Figure on the Cost of a
New Plant.
The City Engineer was finally direct- j
ed to make an estimate as to -what an |
entirely new distributing plant would j
cost. He made it, and figured that for i
a city of 350,000, which was the basis :
he was instructed to figure on, it would j
cost $3,500,000.
Then the City Engineer was a?ked to j
take the water company's inventory of j
its property and figure what it was
worth to the city.
For this work Ernest Abs Hagen, a j
competent engineer of unquestioned
reputation and ability was chosen. He
made an exhaustive examination as per
the water company's own return of its
property. The result of his examina
tion he himself speaks of elsewhere.
That result was that the water com
pany's plant at a liberal valuation was
worth to the city $1,192,000.
The water company's price was and
is how understood to be $3,000,000, al
though it has never yet given a posi
tive price to the City Council.
For once the corporation had been
outgeneraled. Engineer Abs Hagen's
i report was submitted to the Council by
the City Engineer, and it raised con
sternation in the ranks of the water
company, their allies, official and unof-
I ficial, and their newspaper organs.
Abs Hagen was bitterly condemned
j and denounced, and he has -ever since
i been excluded from city employment.
; He made an honest report and lost all
prospect of present employment by the
city. His report did not suit those who
are running things.
But the figures and facts set forth in
his report never were assailed. They
are absolutely unassailable.
This report of Abs Hagen's, mnde as
the City Engineer, was a bombshell in
the City Council. The members there
who seem to have forgotten ajojut what
THE SAX FEAXCTSCO CALL, MONDAY, JAITUABY 17, 1808.
| they Lad promised the peopit; prior tc
th>-ir election did not know what to do.
Finally it was decided to offer the
! water company $1,192,000 for its plant.
As a matter of form this was done, and
the result was that the offer was
promptly refused.
The next step under the contract was
; arbitration. But the water company
declined to arbitrate, claiming that
I under their contract they were not
compelled to arbitrate until after July
2*.\ IÂ£SB, when their contract expired.
Then delays and delays and delays.
The Council acted as though it was
fearful lest it might do something that
would clear up the matter and push it
along closer to consummation. If sev
en members had any such fear or ap
prehension it was ground
Then a petition, signed by NOO vot
ers, was filed, asking the Council to at
once call an election to vote bonds to
construct an entirely new water dis
tributing plant.
The petition is now in the hands of
the. Council, and there It will remain.
The citizen who honestly desires mu
nicipal ownership does not think the '
outlook auspicious to secure it imme
diately. The proposition is being stop
pf d in the house of its supposed friends
âthat is to say, by city officials, who
claim to favor it and by newspapers
which for various considerations are
the allies of the water company.
Messrs. Silver, Mathuss, Baker, Toll,
Ashman, Nickel! and Blanchard will
' tell you that they are for municipal
ownership, but they are not willing to
take one single solitary step or to sup
port a motion or measure that will
\ open the way to bring it about.
The newspapers all deny that they
j are controlled by the water company,
! either directly or indirectly, yet they
furnish almost daily evidence of it by
their editorial policy.
A man, either In public or private
life, who manifests any activity in the
way of municipal ownership promptly
has his wings clipped by the press In
j so far as it is possible for the syndi-
I cated dailies to effect this.
In the Council . Messrs. Grider and
Hutchison are the only two- members
who have placed themselves squarely
on record on the water question. They
i are distinctively anti-water company
1 men. They are both honorable, and
are above purchase. They may be
I radical in their views, but the opinion
of citizens generally is that they are
trying to carry out their ante-election
promises, and to secure for the people
of this city water at the lowest possi
ble rate it can be given to consumers
i direct by the municipality itself.
The Mayor of the city, M. P. Snyder.
whatever else may be charged against
him by his political enemies, has never
been accused of being an ally of the
water company. He is doing the best
he can in his- official position to effect
| the change provided for in the contract
' In a signed article for The Call the
i ; head of the municipality touches upon
i j the water question in no uncertain
, i way.
VIEWS OF COUNCIL
MAN E. L. HUTCHISON.
Prior to his election to the City
Council Edward L. Hutchison was an
instructor in the public schools of the
city. He was elected from the Eighth,
the one ward in the city where the
people of ordinary means make four
fifths of the population. He is a very
piain, blunt-spoken sort of citizen,
young, active and courageous. He
tells what he thinks about the situa
tion.
To the Editor of the ('all-
Sir: In the I,os Angela* municipal
campaign of a y.ar hk" '!.â¢â¢ platforms
of all political parties f.-.iri
and bellowed for thf municipal o-wnor
ship of a water plant and tor the con
struction of an entirely now v.
plant at the earliest posible date.
The Democratic and Populist plat
forms, upon which I v i to
the City Council, together with t
other?, declared "Unqualifiedly .-it.-I
unreservedly in favor of an entirely
new plant to be owned and operated
by the people for the people, the rates
to be charp^l to !>â¢â  Dpon a basis of
actual cost of distribution."
The snmo platforms also declared in
favor of "A supply of pure water from
mountain sources in place Of the un
desirable "substance 1 furnished us by
the Los Angeles city Water
Company"; and they were ho
clear and clamorous in favoring the
construction of the proru>sf<l water
plant with "sufficient pressure for fire
purposes, thus savins the city a I
portion of the annual expense of $M.
000 for an expensive fire department .
besides thousands upon thousands of
dollars every year in fire insurance."
The final clause in the said plank was
a." follows:
We Uem&nd that the neccstaiy proceed-
ings tending to the acquisition of such a
system be Instituted immediately, and we
pledge each and all of our candidates that.
If elected, they will take Immediate steps
upon taking office In the honest and earnest
Investigation of Bald matter, with a view
to the acquisition and construction of said
water mil electric light Rj'stem. and that
all proceedings be pressed with all possible
dispatch, to the end that fnid system. If
found feasible and reasonable, shall be
constructed and in operation before the
expiration of the present privileges of the
city water company.
And, In general, the Republican plat
form was like unto these; and every
city official ele â¢ 5 last year was "ab
solutely and unqualifiedly pledged" to
do something at once, which has not
been done to this day. But five short
months of the lease of the City Water
Company yet remain.
The present city government has
frittered away more than a year in a
vain and foolish attempt to acquire
not an entirely new and â¢ adequate
water plant of scientific construction
of sufficient capacity to supply a great
city, and with force enough to serve as
an agent for the extinguishment of
conflagrations, besides furnishing pow
er for a great electric lighting'sys
temâbut a scurvy, Little antiquated
system of rusty water "mains" of the
enormous diameter of two inches.
Some thirty years ago the Council
of the village of Los Angeles entered
into an alleged agreement with certain
individuals by which the latter were
to have the privilege of using the
water of the Los Angeles River, which
is owned by the city; and at the end
of thirty years the city was to buy
the plant of the said individuals at
whatever it was worth. .
At present the plant of the City
Water Company consists of a batch
of ancient machinery, some antiquat
ed neadworks for extracting water
and diluted mud from the bogs up
the river, a few ponds called "reser
voirs" and about 300 miles of rusty
"mains." of which latter commodity
the average size is about three inches,
ISO miles thereof being of no more
than two-inch pipe.
Only 9 per cent of the ponderous
"water mains" of this city are more
than four inches in diameter, and
many miles thereof are of that per
ishable material commonly called
sheet iron.
For all this rust firu' scrap iron, and
for ail these bop sinks, the City Wa
ter Company asks the Town Council
to pay the modest sum of $3,000,n00.
City Engineer Djpckweiler prepared
plans and estimates for an elaborate
water By stem, in accordance with the
political platforms of the late munici
pal campaign, the smallest main in
any side street to be Inches in
diameter, <t of nine times the ca
pacity of â¢ ge main of the
â¢ system, and the entire cost
I for a city
100 inhabitants was found to be
but little more than |
If this city can construct a prrcat
â  in for 13,000,000, with water
mains of S, 12. 18, 3<> and 40 inches in
diameter, it would he a crime to pay
any such sum for the rusty pipes that
ivw ('.rip a little water here and there
over the city, and which aggravate
the entire Fire Department
time it tries to extraci from tho said
pipes enougti water to quench the
dames in a burning shanty.
The Los Angeles Water Company is
more powerful as a political engine
after elections than as a distributor
of water to the public. Most of the
newspapers of this city appear to be
in it* employ or upon its pay roll.
The Express seems to be its steadiest
and most trusted ally. The Times
seems to grow restive occasionallyâ
but it usually cools down into a.
friendly apologist for the water com
pany within a lay or two after its
bluster or covert attack upon the
said company. , â 
In a labored editorial published a
few days ago, the Express said that
the water company is a large tax
payer of this city. and that for that
particular reason it was foolish to
think that the water company would
take advantage of the city, or the tax
payers thereof. Whether the editor
did not know that the water company
might want to get back its tax money
together with the tax money paid by
20,000 or 100,000 others is not known to
everybody.
Nobody but the water company can
ever know how many people there are
here, or how few, who are under the
thumb of the said company for pe
cuniary reasons; but it is certain that
there are many officials* of the city
and ma private citizens wri*o see
through the water company's spec
tacles because of pressure brought
about by pure business relationship
and constant insidious maneuvering on
the part of the astute management
of the water company.
I could name half a dozen city offi
cials whose worst enemies never ac
cused them of downright bribery for
coin, and whose official conduct con
the water question is ab
solutely inexplicable if it be not for
the Insidious Influence of business re
liiti'T.
Mayor Snvder has fought well for
s of the people. In the
City Council, Mr. Orider and myself
fought ona and hard to have plans
timates tor s. new water system
prepared by City Engineer Dockwei'er,
or under his supervision. It took a
Qgbi equally lonir and bard to get an
: y of the slant of th>-
Water Company.
That inventory, made by Ernest
A.bs Hagen, C. EL, unde/ the super
vision of Engineer Dockweiler, was
most minutely exhaustive, and It re
vealed the fact that nobody could find
any value in the present water plant
beyond the sum of $1,190,000. That is
far less than the three millions asked
for the plant by the water company.
No criticism of Mr. Abs Hagen's
Bdenttfip investigations and careful es
timate of the water plant was ever
made ty anybody; yet somebody's
political and sinister Influence has pre
vented the city from employing him in
any similar work for the past six
months.
The water company manages to
â queexe out of the property-owners of
this city Ã¼bout $600,000 a year. About
530U.000 of that is clear profit to theeom
pany. The service is utterly unsatis
factory and inadequate. In many sec
tions of the city the water 1 -Ipea are
almost empty f<>r several hours each
day and the pressure is but slight at
all timr-;.
Almost the entire city is eager for
a new and adequate water plant. The
city ov. is every Inch of water in tho
Los Anseles Ktver. The lease of the
City Water Company will expire next
summer. The supply of water in tha
mountains north of the city is ade
quate for the city and is available for
its use.
The present water plant is worse
than worthless as a nucleus for a
new plant or as a part of a great sys
tem. It would be of no more use as
the basis of a new system than a
Waterbury watch would be as a basis
for a fine watch. Its attempted use
would entail almost endless expense in
every part of the city.
The present policy of the majority
of the city officials seems to be to
watt and wait and wait. Kvery move
<-:uis. s w.-cks of unnecessary delay.
The city should begin the construc
tion of a new system of its own with
out delay. Its alleged contract to pur
!>â <â¢ alleged plant of the City
\\ ;.ur Company does not prevent it
from constructing an entirely new
water plant of its own after modern
and scientific plans.
If we must purchase the present
water plant, we can utilize some parts
of it, perhaps, but we need not burden
the city with any further attempt to
ERNEST ABS HAGEN, C. E.
make water run up hill through iron
rust.
If The Call will but aid us in our
work and lead us out "t' >>ur legal
and illegal dilemmas of Lua
Anpelos will owe The Call a debt of
gratitude. Yours truly.
EDWARD L. HUTCHISON.
Councilman Eighth Ward, Los An
geles.
AS COUNCILMAN
L. M. GRIDERSEES IT.
Councilman L. M. Gnder always ha?
been one of the best known real estate
men in the city. He was elected to
the Council from one of the aristocratic
wards and has made quite a reputation
for himself. He has demonstrated
that he is beyond the reach of toe
water company. His views of the situ
ation are below.
To the Editor of The fallâ Sir: It
is indeed fortunate for the city of Los
- that ;i great newspap
The Call i* willing to take up the
fipht of its people against the corpor
ate monopoly which now controls Its
water supply, and which Is seeking
through a subsidised press to perpetu
ate such control, <>r to swindle the
city by selling what it has for
000 more than it is worth.
The Los tallies with one
d â have openly
water com
pany, and the fact that The Call has
taken up tl on behalf of the
; â  .â¢ promise for I
tore brighter.
Every ctty officialâ certainly every
member of the present Council â was
pledped prior to election to tak>
imni- dlately to secure a. municipal
water system, to be owned and con
trolled by the city, nothing was said
in any of the platforms or pledges
about waiting untii m-xt July
if the water company's plant could
be purchased, and no candidate men
tioned such a thing: during the cam
paign; if one had, such one would
not now be â  city official.
The Democratic platform especially
ignored the plant of the water ("in
pfiny and pledged its candid.
immediately construct an :r,<.
eat water system, and. if praetlcable,
to brinp the water fmrn a mountain
source and not from the Los Angeles
River, the source of our present sup
ply.
As early as January 12. 1897. I intro
duced a resolution in the Council di
rectlng th> City Engineer to prepare
plans and specifications for a water
system to be owned by the city, with
estimate of cost. This was voted
down. The Herald next day denounced
the majority for having betrayed the
people, but the Herald was not then
controlled by the water company.
It then became evident that a ma
jority of the Council were not going
to carry out their pledges, but were
going to try and find out how not
to do it. The lion in the way was
found Jn the shape of a contract he
tween the city and the water com
pany, made in 1868, binding the city
to buy the Improvements of the water
company in Jul I a price to
be agreed on or fixed by arbitration.
1 am credibly informed that this
contract was secured by corruption
and fraud, and every one T have talk
ed with who was familiar with the
matter at that early date has stated
that it was a Job. But be that as it
may. no attorney not in the employ
of the water company has ever claim
ed that their contract could be en
forced against the city. Tn this con
nection I may state that my under*
standing of the law is that a city of
ficial Is in duty bound to insist upon
every legal right and legal defense
â¢which the city has.
Now although every city official
knew of this contract as well when
he made his pledge for Immediate
construction of a water system as he
does now, still the majority of the
Council are making tnis contract their
excuse for not carrying out their
pledges.
Impatient with the delay about this,
thousands of residents of the city in
November last filed a petition with
the Council asking thnt an election
be Immediately called to vote bonds
to build a water system. This was
referred to the Water Supply Com
mittee, which committee held a public
meeting to consider it. Any ordinary
man hearing the discuMion which
took place at this meeting would
have suppose, l that a prominent
member of the Water Supply Com
mittee was there as the special agent
of the water company, so watchful
was ho of the interests of that cor
poration and so fearful iest the square
thing shoud not be done by that soul
less organization. Kven the special
counsel of the city did not seem to
have even bothered his brain or dis
turbed his lawbook in endeavoring to
advise the city how to avoid the
afore-mentioned contract. In fact, it
seemed that this contract mi a
savior and a deliverer to the majority
of the Water Supply Committee,
which led them out of the land of
bondage to their pledges to the peo
ple, not to mention their reaching the
water company land of milk and
honey.
The petition was reported back with
a recommendation in substance that
the water company be requested to
pleape consent to immediately sell Its
plant to the city. The water company
has not as yet hearkened to the
prayer of the Council, and some, lack-
Ing In faith, say tt never will.
What will the Council do? Well, I
am now as always in favor of build- â¢
Ing at once and now a new and com
plete water system, completely Ignor
ing 1 the Witter company, but I have
small hopes that this will be done. \ I ;;
believe that after all possible delay
has been obtained In other ways, the
, majority of the Council will order a
reappralsement of the water com
pany's plant, and that the matter will
be so arranged, that a much higher
appraisement than the former one of ' ,
$1,190,055 will be made; that when July
has come and they are certain who
the third referee will be, the water
company will consent to sell its plant
at a price to Joe fixed by arbitration; â¢
that referees will be appointed who
will report a much higher valuation
than that reported by City Engineer
Dockweiler last summer; that the
people will be asked to vote bonds to
consummate the purchase; that the
bonds will be defeated, and then the
people will have to settle the matter
at the next city election. Yours truly,
L. M. GRIDER,
Councilman of the Sixth Ward, Los
Ang'
THE EXPERT'S FIGURES
What the Value of the Water
Company's Plant Really Is.
The property for which the water
company is endeavoring to squeeze
$3,000,000 out of the people and which
bargain the syndicate press of Los An
geies has given its quasi approval to is
by one of the best known expert en
gineers in the country figured to be
worth just $1,192,000.
Mr. Abs Hagen has credentials which
establish beyond question hiS experi
ence and ability. He is being followed
and hounded to a more or less extent
and an endeavor is being made to
drive him out of the city by rendering
it impossible for him to make a living
here. However, the effort may fail.
Anyway, whiie Mr. Abs Hagen is yet
here he has consented to give a few
facts for the readers of The Call.
To the Editor of The Callâ Sir: A
water works system, complete in all its
appurtenances, subservient to the needs
city with over 100,000 inhabitants,
with a supply and distribution sys
tem sufficiently large to respond to
the needed subsequent enlargements,
in order to meet the requirements
of a yearly increasing population;
well planned, carefully executed and
economically administeredâ is not only
a necessity of the present age
but a boon to the people whom
it deserves. Dependence on its ac
curate, never failing action reduces
I the expense caused by fires, it insures
; clean streets, well flushed sewers,
j wholesome water for domestic uses and
it reverberates in general to the credit
' of its owners, i. c.. it pays a handsome
interest on the capital invested.
Such a system is needed for the city
of Los Angeles. The question of ob
taining the same has been agitated
some years. It is now at the point of
taking its form of development, and in
oruVr to evolve s?u<-h a system in the
, desired direction it must be guided
I from the start, trained and directed so
as to produce an ultimate result ade
quate to the needs and wants of the
j people.
As a beginning 1 toward a successful
end this city Is confronted with the fact
; of having to buy a water works system
j at the present owned by private parties,
! of either enlarging, renovating and im
| proving such undesirable features In
\ this system as are or may become ap
! parent, or else substitute an entirely
1 new system for the old one, which lat
ter at all events will have to be bought
and paid for at such a price as may be
i agreed upon.
A contract made thirty years ago ne
cessitates the acquisition of this prop
erty. The price which is to be paid for
this property is the stumbling: block for
the rapid solution of the question. The
purchase prise asked by the present
owners Is $3,000,000. The sum offered
by the city and based on careful engi
neering investigations is a little over
$1,000,000. This produces a gap in the
present business negotiations which ap
parently only time, arbitration, law
suits and similar time-consuming ex
pediments may overbridge.
A comparison of the present water
works system as it shows itself to be
with what it ought to be leads to some
astonishing results.
It is the aim of the writer to present
the existing conditions of the Los An
i geles water works system to the reader
:in as calm, unbiased and correct a
j manner as possible, based upon a pre
j viously made searching investigation
reduced to a dollar and cent estimate.
Every item of such estimate can be
substantiated and verified.
A schedule list of the city water
works property was filed by the offi
cers of this company with the city vi
thorities, which list ein"ora<:<:H every
ti^e o! r-.V estate, every piece of ihe
numerous features, such as tunnels,
conduits, reservoirs, power station? and
pipe system, which go to make up a
large water works system. Water
rights and rights of way. etc., will be
considered, and ihe prices se* opposite
the different items are, in* the opinion
of the writer, not only adequate, hut
like material can be bought to-day in
open market for less money if purchas
ed in large quantities.
The object and aim being to arrive? at
a fair valuation, giving at all ~v* nts,
the benefit of the doubt to the present
water works.
The investigation was made by rig
idly inspecting every one of the fea
tures of the system.
Three hundred and eighteen pipes at
different localities were unearthed,
tested and their condition noted, in or
der to arrive at a fair understanding
of the general nature of the pipe ys
tem. The sizes and conditions of the
pipes were ascertained, depths and
â widths of excavations measured; com
parison was made with the record of
the pipe system as submitted by the
company; errors of sizes, etc., were
thereby corrected, and the first star
tling discrepancy between facts and fig
ures was shown to be that instead of
1,870,931 feet of pipe system as listed
by the company, but 1.6K2.259 feet, ot
a difference of over 35 miles of pipes
was found. It appears, that the com
pany has carried en Its record all
abandoned lines, and submitted same
as part of their system.
N The condition of the existing pipe
lines was scrutinized, and investigation
showed that out of 114 pipes of two
and three inch dimension, 47 are good,
67 in poor condition. Out of 153 cast
iron pipe of various sizes, 145 are good
and 8 are poor; out of 51 sheet iron
pipe of various sizes, 29 are good, 22 are
poor.
It was further found that there are
at present within the city limits a lit
tle over 23 miles of pipes, which are
paralleled by others of larger dimen
sions. This latter fact shows that such
23 miles of pipes of insufficient sizes
had to be augmented by parallel pipe
lines. The combined capacity of both
are found to be hardly sufficient for
present requirements.
The pipe system was found to con
sist of 103 miles of cast iron pipes,
equaling 32 per cent of the whole sys
tem; of IS9 miles, or 60 per cent, of
wrought iron: of 3.75 miles, ot 1 per
cent of cement lined pipe: of 21 miles,
or 7 per cent of sheet iron; or a total of
318 miles of pipe, good, bad and indif
ferent.
The conditions of the pipes were
found to be as follows: All cast Iron
pipes, with the exception of those suf
fering from the effects of electrolysis,
were found to be good and serviceable.
All wrought iron pipes, except the new
ly laid, were found to be covered with
rust and deteriorating rapidly. All
sheet iron pipes, except such as were
laid in deep trenches and favored by
local conditions of the soil, were badly
deteriorated, and some utterly spoiled
by rust. The cement lined pipes were
absolutely worthless. Sooner or later,
within the next five or ten years, every
one of the pipes, except the cast iron
pipes, will have to be replaced by cast
iron mains.
The sizes of the mains, as found in
connection with this system, furnish a
remarkable illustration of what can be
done with inadequate means, by the
use of good judgment and careful ad
ministration by the one party and in
dulgence by the other.
Out of a total of 1,626,490 feet of avail
able pipes, there are at present in i^S":
Of 2-inch pipe. 55 per cent; of 3-inch
pipe, 5.5 per cent; of 4-inch pipe. IS 5
per cent; of 5-inch pipe, .5 per cent; of
6-inch pipe, 6.5 per cent; of 7-inch pipe,

The preponderance of 2-inch, 3-lnch

the more apparent when it is consid

there are no hydrants available except
where connected with 4-inch or larger

of pipe predominate.
The propected city water works sys

The present system contains less than
twenty miles of such pipes. The depth
to which mains are laid is inadequate,
the average depth of 2-inch and 3-inch

AILING SWINE
GIVEN RELIEF
Successful Tests of the
Anti-Toxine for Hog
Cholera.
Dr. Salmon Submits an Encour
aging Report to Secretary
Wilson.
Congress Will Be Asked to Appropri
ate Money for the Distribution
of Serun i.
Special DlÃpatch to The Call.
Call Office. P.iggs House,
Washington, Jan. I*s.
The chief of the Bureau of Animal
Industry, Dr. D. E. Salmon, has sub
mitted to Secretary Wilson a report
upon the experiments made in the
treatment of hogs for hog cholera with
anti-toxine scrum. This serum Is made
upon the same principle as the anti
toxine of diphtheria. Good serum has
been oljt.aini.-il from both horses
cattle, a horse or row being in"< a
with the h>>g cholera virus in small
quantities at first, and with larger
after suitable intervals of time.
The resistance of the animal is thus
! to the highest p; point.
The blood of such an animal when in-
I under the skin of SWinfi has ':â â¢ â â¢ n
found t" possess both a preventive aDd
curative action.
This serum was first tested uj>on
small animals in the laboratory, and,
being found efficacious, was last fall
tested in Page County, lowa, on sev
eral herds of swine, containing alto
gether 278 animals. Leaving out one
herd, from which definite returns as to
cause of death could not be obtained,
only 3l< died out of l'-J4 animals treat
ed, of which 86 were .siÂ«-k. Consequent
ly 82.8 per cent of the animals of these
herds were saved. Of untreated hogs
kept under observation during the pe
riod referred to, about 85 per cent of
thÂ»- animals died.
Dr. Salmon believes that with experi
ence a better quality of scrum can be
prepared, and he has no doubt tfiat
this percentage can be maintained
hereafter.
Referring to this report, Secretary
"Wilson remarked that undoubtedly the
I results reported by Dr. Salmon were
j most encouraging to hog raisers. The
i cost of the serum now. said the Secre
j tary, was but 10 cents per head of ani
mals treated, only one dc-se being re
! quired, and doubtless in course of time
i this light cost may still be further re-
J duced.
"It is, in my opinion," said the
'â  Secretary, "of the utmost importance
, that this serum, for the next year at
least, be made by the bureau under our
own supervision and distributed in
large quantities in order to demon
strate its efficacy upon a more extend
jed scale. It is absolutely essential that
during the experimental stage serum
of undoubted quality be. used. Unless
the hog growers can obtain it from this
department they will be forced to de
pend upon what can be obtained from
private sources, and, owing to the nov
elty of this product, not only will dls
couragingly exorbitant prices be charg
ed for it, but in many cases inferior
products may be offered. This would
preclude the possibility of making a
satisfactory test on a widely extended
scale.
"I propse to ask Congress to provide
j an appropriation necessary to enable
' this department to furnish 2.000.000
doses of serum during the next year
and to make a considerable portion, of
the appropriation immediately avail -
; able. It seems from Dr. Salmon's re
port that It takes three or four months
to put a horse or cow Into condition to
I supply the serum: consequently the
1 work unon an extended scale must be
undertaken at once.
"The losses from hog cholera are so
' enormous and have welched so heav
ily for years upon our farmers that I
'â  cannot Imagine that Conpress will for a
j moment hesitate to make the appro
priations necessary to carry on this
work thoroughly. Indeed, apart from
: the great stake the farmers hay* in
i this matter, to refuse to proviso for a
thorough test of this remedy now would
, he. indeed, 'penny wise and pound fool
ish': for the discovery of this serum has
Involved already many. years of work
and a very large sum of money. It
would be a great mistake now that so

GREAT BRITAIN'S SHARE
OF THE CHINESE PUDDING.
Concessions to Be Acquired Through the
Proposed Loan to the Imperial

LONDON, Jan. 16.-The Peking cor
respondent of the Times says: Yester
day (Saturday) Sir Claude Mac Donald,
British Embassador to China, in the
course of an Interview with the Tsung-
LJ-Yamen (Board of Foreign Control),
stated that England was willing to as
sist China to liquidate the Japanese in
demnity, and would provide a loan of
Â£12.000.000 at par, to run fifty years, the
service to be 4 per cent net. including
sinking fund conditions, as follows:
Firstâ The opening of three treaty
ports, the Talien-Wan. Slang-In and
Nan-Ning. thereby increasing the cus
toms revenues; second; a declaration
that no portion of the Yang-Tse-Kiang
Valley shall b<- alienated to any other
power; third, the right to extend the
Burmafa railway through Hunan prov
ince (the most southwestern In China).
In the event of her default China is to
place certain revenues under the control
of the Imperial customs. On this basis
the negotiations will proceed. China re
gards them as advantageous, but fears
the threatened apposition of France and
Russia, especially to the opening of
Tall-en-Wan and Nan-Nit,
The Times, commenting on the report,
suggests that Siang-In. which the cor
respondent describes as "in Hunan prov
ince" is a telegraphic error and means
cither Siang Yang in Hu-Pei province, or
Siang-Tang, in llu-Nan province.

The threatened crisis In the Cuban

They all agree that the worst is

a result of my conversation with them.
There is no immediate intention of In

the developments in the island within
the next two months.
The Herald's special cable from Mad

that the râ¬ nt rioting in Havana was
the result of a great conservative plot
against the Sagasta ministry of Spain,
attracted wide attention in diplimatlc
and official circles here The dispatch
was read with great Interest, particu

from the riots thai the authorities made
such prompt preparations for sending
a warship to Havana. They feared
that i:' the plot should succeed and
Captain-General Blanco should be
overthrown anarchy would prevail. The
â¢ character of the news from Ha
vana, however, during the past
days has somewhat eased th> j ir minds
on this score.
In the opinion of Minister de Lome,
the riots have Improved rather than
aggravated the- situation. !!â¢â¢ thinks
they have cleared the atmosphere and
thai General Blanco will now be able
to vigorously push his plans for auton
omy without any further Betback He
considers the riots solely th. result of

that he will consider that it is not com

According to a telegram received this
morning by captain A. s. Crowin
shleld, chief of the Bureau of Naviga
tion, from Rear Admiral Sicard, the
North Atlantic squadron left Hampton
[loads to-day for the Gulf of Florida.
The squadron is the Strongest that lias
been in southern waters since the close
of the civil War. it comprises the
battle-shipa lowa, Indiana ami Massa
chusetts, second-class battle-ship
Texas and armored cruiser New York.
The squadron is expected to reach Dry
TortUgaS on Saturday.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 16.â Grave ap
prehensions were felt, by both the ofil
cials of the State Department and those
erf the Spanish Legation that disturb
ances of a more or less sen. .us charac
ter might occur in Havana to-day, ow
ing to the fact that many persons oth
erwise occupied during the week would
be comparatively free on- this day to
follow their own Ine (nations. Advices
received by Minister de Lirme to-day,
followed by others at a later hour, in
dicate, however, that Havana was per
fectly tranquil. After noon the Minis
ter received a dispatch conveying the
information that at 11 o'clock this
morning there had not only been no
rioting, but that there were not even
sporadic disturbances crt any kind. As
a precautionary measure. General
Blanco had carefully provided against
any trouble, but so far as surface indi
cations went, the precautions he had
taken were entirely unnecessary. The
advices were that the better judgment
of the people was uppermost. Good
feeling prevailed generally through
out the city, and no disturbances were
anticipated.
Ip to ?, o'clock this afternoon State
Department officials had received no
word from Havana, and th -y accepted
this as an Indication that no trouble
had occurred or was anticipated. They
regard the rioting < f last week as
merely a flurry which spent Its force
in the few hours it lasted.
General Lee is under instructions to
notify the department promptly of
anything unusual or in the least way
threatening, and the fact that no dis
patch was received from him clearly
Indicates that the city Is practically
absolutely quiet.
Becretary I^>ng has received no ad
ditional Information concerning the
movements of the North Atlantic
squadron and said that he expect. .1
none. Admiral Heard simply carried
out the orders previously issued to him
and sailed to-day with the main body
of the squadron for Southern waters
to enter upon the usual winter maneuv
ers.
NORFOLK, Va., Jan. 16,â Having
completed coaling and nil provisions
for their winter's cruise In Gulf waters,
the ships of the North Atlantic squad
ron, which have teen anchored in
Hampton Roads for the past ten weeks,
the flagship New York and the battle
ships Indiana, Massachusetts and lowa
left < >ld Point at 10 a. m. and two hours
later passed out the rapes, south bound.
They put to sea in the teeth of a north
easter which is blowing off Hatteras
to-night. It is Admiral Sicard's inten
tion to keep well away from the stormy
cape. The fleet will proceed directly, at
tfii knots speed, to Dry Tortugas, their
headquarters for the Gulf evolutions.
This point is within such easy reach of
Havana that the ships could be sum
moned in a few hours should their
presence be necessary. The Texas will
join the flagship off the South Carolina
coast. The torpedo-boat Foote was
forced to take the inside route owing
to the heavy weather off Hatteras. The
ships are equipped for a long voyage
and their magazines arf well stocked.
HAVANA, Jan. 16.â N0 â¢'disagreea

SEATTLE, Jan. 16.â The steam schooner
Noyo arrived here to-night from Skaguay
and I've;'.. Alaska. Among her passen
g> rs was Hans Larsen of Circle City, who
came "'.it t" Dyea with a <i.>g train by
way of Dawson City. He said there was
plenty of food at Circle City. He also
conllrmrd previous reports that there
would lie no suffering at Dawson this
winter from lack of provisions, as the
exodus bad removed danger of famine.
He <iid not think that the government
relief expedition was feasible at this time.
J. A. Lacy of San Francisco, who took
a cargo <>f lumber to Bkaguay on the
Nfoyo, says so great is the demand for
lumber that the people can hardly wait
until It is unloaded. Lacy Bays that but
a small part of the hundreds of people ar
riving at Dyea and Skaguay intent on
pushing on to Dawson, have any con
ceptlon of the difficulties before them. H<j
predicts that the congestion on the trails
will be greater than it was last season.
VESSELS IN NEED
OF AMMUNITION
Navy Lacks Sufficient Powder
for Use in Case of
Emergency.
Officers Arjree That the Batteries on
Commissioned Warships Should
Be Modernized.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office. Rlggs House,
"Wash! . Jan. 16.
Naval officers generally agree with the
statements made by Assistant Becretary
of th< â  ps should
t.e taken to modernise the batteries of
many vessels now In commission. I un
derstand that Mr. Roosevelt informal the
President yesterday that the navy was
also badly tn need of ammunition. Mr.

the navy has a supply of powder suffi
cient, for peace purposes, but in case of
ency, he thinks, there :s not enough
p >wder t>> rapidly replace that now In tne
magazines of the men-of-war.
Naval officers generally say Congress
should lose no tim* in appropriating the
$500,000 required by TCcretary Long for the
purchase of reserve ammunition. The
only recent contract made by the depart
ment for powder was that entered into
several months ago for I'JO.OOO pounds of
six-inch smoke';.--.; powder.
It is desired by Captain Charles O'Neill.
chief of the bureau of ordnance, that ne
be given authority to convert all of the
six-inch gutis of ordinary type now in ser
vice Into rapid-firing guns. He has esti
mated that 125,000 Will be needed, and has
urged that Congress make an appropria
tion without delay. There are ninety-five
six-inch guns of ordinary type on board
ships of the navy, and their conversion.
Captain O'Neill says, will double th. ir ef
flciency. The cost of converting a six-inch
gun Is ab.ait $1000, and the time required
would be from five to six months for each
lot of twelve guns undertaken at the
s.i me time.
Bight six-Inch guns have already been
converted, and work on nineteen was
commenced some months ago. Eighteen
of these are for the Newark and Atlanta.
Buried Under Sacks of Wheat.

young man of IS years, working on the
Fulgham rancli. bad a narrow escape
from death yesterday. He was soaking
wheat in Milestone liquid !>â¢ fore sowing
in the field when a large pile of wheat
in sacks fell, covering him completely. It
was probably an hour before he was dis
covered by his employer, as he failed to
report for dinner. With all haste the
tumbled sacks were thrown aside and the
poor fellow rescued. He could neither
speak nor walk, and nearly two hours
passed before he was able to realize what
bad happened. Another half-hour's im
prisonment would have been fatal.

Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, D. C, Jan. 16.
In her apartment in the Wellington
Hotel last night, Mrs. Lucille Lane,
youngest daughter of ex-SenatÂ»r Joe;
Blackburn of Kentucky, shot herself.
According to the statement given out
by the family the shooting was acci
dental. Both of Mrs. Lane's physi
cians refused to discuss the subject,
even to the extent of saying whether
or not the wound would prove fatal,
but from the best that can be learned
she will probably recover, although
now suffering severely from shock. A
friend of the family nominated to give
out a statement said about midnight
on Saturday that Mrs. Lane was pre
paring to retire. Her husband at the
time was in the adjoining room look
ing over the paper. Mrs. Lane opened
a bureau drawer to get a handkerchief
and picked up a handful of gloves and
laces which had been tossed together
in the drawer. Under this fluffy mass
was a tiny lady's pistol, a gift to Mrs.
Lane from her father and a posses
sion of which she was particularly
fond. It caught in a piece of lace as
sh-- raised her hand, and falling of Its
own weight struck the hammer on the
edge of the open drawer. The pistol
exploded and the ball penetrated her
left breast. What became of it is |I
possible to say.
Lucille is the youngest daughter of
the bullet struck a rib and ranged
around beneath the left shoulder, mak
ing only a superficial wound. At the
same time it is said Mrs. Lane is suf
fering BO from the shock that the phy
sicians have devoted all their energies
to rallying her without attempting to
definitely ascertain the extent of the
injury. The most precise statement
thai either physician would make to
night was that Mrs. Lane would prob
ably live until morning. At the re
quest of the family the Mock in which
tht> hotel is Bituatefl has been roped off.
Senator Blackburn is deeply affected
by the occurrence. He does not live
with his daughter, and when the af
fair occurred was summoned from his
room on New York avenue, remaining
thereafter at Mrs. Lane's hotel.
Lucille was the youngest daughter of
Senator Blackburn. She was' married
In 1895 to Thomas F. Lane, a prominent
business man and politician of Sum
mit, N. J. At the time of the marriage
Mr. Lane was a chief of division in the
Treasury Department. Subsequently
he accepted a place with the Maxim
Arms Company of New York as their
agent in Washington. The position is
reputed a good one, and the Lanes had
apparently always an abundance of
money, which they spent freely, living
at a fashionable hotel and seeming to
lack none of the good things of life.
Their little girl, something over a year
old. was one of the favorites about the
house with all who knew her and the
particular pride of her mother. Mr.
and Mrs. Lane, according to those who
saw them every day. were unvaryingly
affectionate and attentive to each
other, and she, while of slight phy
sique, was in excellent health.
Mrs. Blackburn, who Is not In *the
city, has been telegraphed for. Mrs.

WEEK'S WORK
IN CONGRESS
The Annexationists Show
Their Weakness by
Further Delay.
Senators Will Enter a Discus
sion of the Immigra
tion Bill.
In the House There Is a Prospect of
Considerable Argument on For
eign Relations.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Jan. 16.
The Hawaiian annexation treaty will
this week again occupy the major por
tion of the time o-f the Senate. It ap
pears Improbable, however, that the
treaty will be taken up on Monday.
There is an unanimous agreement to
vote on the immigration bill during the
day. and it is altogether probable that
this vote will be preceded by some dis
cussion of the merits of the bill. The
la at the measure are confident of
its passage, but they are not very hope
ful of getting it through without fur
ther debate.
Senator Wolcott has given notice of
his intention to address the Senate on
Monday, when he will make a report of
the transactions of the recent interna
tional bimetallic commission. Wolcott
has never given extended public utter
ance concerning the commission's work,
and there is very general interest man
ifested as to the course he may pur
sue in his speech on Monday.
When the Senate resumes considera
tion of the Hawaiian treaty Senator
Morgan will take the floor, and it is
expected will consume at least another
day in the presentation of his views in
favor of annexation. He will be fol-
I by Senators Pettigrew and
White in opposition to the treaty and
by other Senators for and against it.
There is no hope that the discussion
will be concluded during the week. A
great many Senators wish to speak,
and as long as the result of the vote is
as uncertain as it is at present, neither
side will be disposed to allow the vote
to be taken.
The Senate has agreed to vote on the
confirmation of Attorney General Mc-
Kenna as Associate Justice of the Su
preme Court on next Friday, and the
probabilities are that this vote will be
preceded by some discussion as to Mr.
McKenna's merits.
The urgent deficiency appropriation
bill will in all probability be reported
on Monday, and there may be an effort
to secure its consideration during the
week.
The House is likely to become the
arena for a general discussion of our
foreign relations in connection with the
consideration of the diplomatic and
consular appropriation bill during the
present week. The Cuban situation
the annexation of Hawaii and the de
signs of the European powers toward
China will, of course, be the principal
topics to attract attention. The House
managers do not want an extended de
bate on Cuba precipitated at this time,
but the minority is determined to press
the question during the consideration
c-f this bill.

POWERFUL
NEW WARSHIP
FOR JAPAN
Launching of the Big
Kasagi Occurs
Thursday.
Most Important Vessel
Built Here for Foreign
Account.
Sisters Being Constructed in
Various Parts of the
World.
WILL RULE THE PACIFIC.
Charles Cramp Speaks of the Signifi
cance of the Increas-i in Japan' 9
Naval Power.
Special Dispatch to Th? Call.
PHILADELPHIA, January 16.â The
launching of the Japanese warship
Kasagi, which was built at Cramps'
shipyard, will take place on Thursday
at noon. The Kasagi is the most im
portant ship ever built in the United
States for foreign account and is the
first foreign warship launched in this
country since the Zobiaca, In 1878. In
compliance with requests for informa
tion from all over the country, Charles
H. Cramp to-day gave the following
Interview:
"The Kasagi is a protected twin
screw cruiser or commerce destroyer of
the latest and most Improved type and
design in her (lass. She is built
throughout of mild steel of the United
States navy standard. Her model is
calculated primarily for high speed, the
contract guarantees being -- 1 - km
the- mean of six runs back and I
over a measured course of ten nautical
miles. She is powered with two four
cylinder vertical inverted direct acting
triple expansion engines, driving twin
screws. Steam is supplied by twelve
Bingle-ended cylindrical boilers, pro
vided with a St. John grate and bearer
bar, and the machinery calculations
contemplate a maximum collective in
dicated horse power of about 17,000. The
Kasagi is among the large number of
ships of various types and classes em
braced in the new naval programme of
Japan.
"A sister ship to her is building on
the Pacific Coast and others of various
classâ¬ 3up to 14.^00 ton battleship -
In England, France, Germany or in
Japan's own dockyard at Yokosuka. It
is worth while to call attention to the
fact that she is a representative of the
most marvelous and formidable naval
development of this age; a develop
ment that is rapidly bringing into front
rank among civilized naval pov.
nation, the ports of which were first
opened to commerce through the in
strumentality of an American naval â¢ x
pedition clearly within the memory of
men not yet past middle age. Prom this
point of view alone her launching is an
event worth remembering in the his
tory of American ship building.
"When the fleet of which the Kasagi
is an- important factor shall be com
pleted, an event not more than two
years off at the farthest. Japan will
rank as the foremost naval power In
the Pacific Ocean and generally speak
ing neariy, if not quite, third in rank
among the naval powers of the world.
She will certainly outrank in the all
around sense ail but England, France
and Russia, and so far as the 1'
Ocean is concerned, will be far superior
to all except England perhaps, and it
is doubtful if even England could, with
due regard to her requirements in her
own \vator3 or in the Mediterranean
and the defense of her commerce spare
naval force enough for concentration on
the Pacific to equal in that ocean the
new Japanese navy of which the Ka-
Bagi is a factor.
"This superiority is due not so much
to the mere number of the vessels
Japan is building, as to the fact that
they are of carefully selected typos,
perfectly elaborated designs and wisely
distributed clasps, all of the most ap
proved construction and highest at
tainable efficiency. The men who oper
ate the material of this force have
demonstrated by th"ir behavior in the
late war and as evinced by the pro
fessional skill and ability they dis
played in the work of supervising ves
sels under construction that they have
no odds to ask in that respect of the
naval officers of any powr-r.
"In short, the v.-hole naval policy of
Japan as represented to Americans by
the object lesson of the Kasagi is one
which nations far older in the. arts of
western civilization would do well to
emulate. Failure to emulate or keep
up with it may in the not distant fu
ture bring some of them to humiliation
and defeat.
"The principal dimensions, qualities
and armament of the Kasagi are as
follows: Length on water line, 374 feej
6 inches; breadth, 48 feet 9 inches,
depth, 30 feet 6 inches; draft, 18 feet 9
inches; displacement, 4900 tons; speed.
22M; knots. Armament: Two 8-incn
breech-loading rifles; ten 4.7-inch
rapid-fire guns; twelve 12-pounder
rapid-fire guns; six Hotchkiss rapiG
fire guns."
The ceremonial attendant upon the
launching of the ship will be exclu
sively in the hands of the Japanese
Minister, and the affair will be con
ducted in accordance with the customs
of the Japanese in such matters. On
the part of the Tramp Company there
will be no special provision for guests,
but the shipyard will be open to the
public at the time r,f the launching.

NOW UP IN ARMS
Continued from Second Page.
grades encroaches upon these dimen
sions.
The distribution system as a whole
seems to be designed irrespective of
engineering rules and without the view
of obtaining the best results by the
aid of approved appliances. It is an
assemblage of various pipe systems
originally laid down with economic
propensities and without reference to
ultimate extension. From time to time
new sections of the city were added to
the nucleus thus obtained, and great
engineering skill, indeed, was needed
and brought to bear upon making and
maintaining such a large system as the
Cross-Section of a Gulch in the Klondike Gold Diggings.
Th- above rut was made from a sketch specially prepared by T. B. Corey of Seattle for The Call. It con
veys a more correct and comprehensive idea of the earth's formation in the famous Klc-nrlike gold fields than any
descriptive matter possibly can. The various gulches along and contiguous to the Yukon River lie in valleys from
200 to 8000 feet wide, between hills and mountains covered with light timber. It is of Blow growth, and ranges
from brush to 12 inches through. In summertime this timber Is cut and later used in thawing the gro-und to reach
bedrock. For every cord of wood used in the Klondike district the Canadian Government exacts a duty of 25 cents
per cord. Many claim owners are required to go two or three miles back in order to get this wood, which makes its
use quite expensive but a positive necessity.
When a prospector first commences work on his claim he tears off a layer of think moss from one to one and
a half feet deep. He then builds a fire and continues to thaw a layer of frozen muck and gravel which extends
in depth fr.Â»m two to thirty feet until the pay streak is reached. The hole being burned down, is usually from rive
to ten fe.n in diameter, and is continued through the pay streak from one to three feet deep and from two to 100
feet wide, until bedr.Tck te reached. During the winter the pay streak dirt is hoisted out. and when the snow thaws
in May and June plenty of water is afforded for the clean-up that brings fabulous wealth to the hardy prospector.
Bench claims are 100 feet square and 7 feet above high water.
For a number of years Mr. Corey was superintendent of the Oregon Improvement Company's mines in the
State of Washington. He has just returned from the Klondike district, where he secured a number of claims and
familiarized himself with the various land formations and streams In the upper Yukon basin.
present with such means at hand. Tt
is safe to assert that there is not in the j
United States at present another
water works system which tries to
accomplish so much as the Los An
geles water works system with such a
vast number of pipes of such vastly
disproportionate sizes.
The books of the water company show
a total of IT, CIS taps, of sizes from
half an inch to six inches. Out of â 
total of 8064 prates there are 2379â 0r 7T
per cent â of two-inch and three-Inch
brass stopcocks. There are no valve
boxes in use. There are 377 meters,
ranging from three-eighths of an inch
to three inches in diameter. There are
at present 535 hydrants, of which 339
werti found to be in good condition,
while 196 wore in bad order. Some of
these were found to be of no service
whatever. The indiscriminate use of
the hydrants for street sprinkling pur
i accounts for the large number
Of hydrants out of order. The require
ments for a complete hydrant system
fur the city Of Los Angeles are not less
' than 1600, against the pres- r.-
The efficiency of the present distri- '
bution system is forcibly illustrated by j
the fact that in all cases where two
and three Inch mains supply the needs
for any section of the city the pi
sure at the house taps is visibly dimin
ished and entirely cut off whenever
more than a limited number of such
taps are open at the same time. A re
liance upon a plentiful supply of water
for fire-extinguishing purposes is en
tirely precluded in Sttcfa places.
The reservoir system is of the mani
fold kind. There are seven reservoirs
listed by the water company, of which
but four are available. The rest were
discarded years ago, and indicate their
former usefulness by some remains, |
earthen walls, concrete debris, etc. The
storage capacity of these four reser- j
volrs is fifty-four and a half million
gallons when full, but only the Buena j
Vista and Beaudry reservoirs carry a '
full supply of eighteen and three-quar
ter million gallons. The new Bellevue
reservoir of thirty-five and a quarter '
million gallons' capacity is usually car- j
rying but one-third of Its capacity, and j
has never been subjected to a contlnu- j
ous stress and strain of its maximum
capacity sufficiently long to demon
strate its worth. The High Service i
! reservoir Is of simple earthwork con
! Btruction, is leaky and in bad order.
Moreover, part of the grounds is not j
owned by the water company, but is
leased.
The three power stations for elevat
ing the water from the low level to the
I high level reservoir are scattered about
the city, and are provided with a very
inferior class of boilers, engines and
i pumps. The East Side springs station
consists of a "Worthington steam pump
of about 225 gallons' capacity per min
ute, and a 40-horsepower stationary
! boiler. The boiler is in good condition,
j but the pump is badly in need of re
pairs. The station is not used at pres
ent, and the machinery is partly dis
mantled.
The Beaudry pump station contains
two 60-horsepower boilers, one of which
is in good condition; also one duplex
â W'.rthington Steam pump of one mil
lion gallons' capacity per twenty-four
hours. The pump is in fairly good
Shape. There are also a number of dis
mantled pumps out of use, lit only for
the scrap pile. The buildings are
wretched, tumbled-down wood shan
ties. The main station of the Buena
Vista reservoir is wc-11 housed in a con
crete and brick building, the machin
ery therein, as a whole, is serviceable.
but too small to answer any increased
demand. It is boing worked now to its
full capacity. It consists of two 60
horsepower boilers, one compound du
plex Wortliington steam pump, bought
second-hand from Nashville, Term.,
still serviceable, and one duplex power
force pump of two and one-third mil
lion gallons' displacement in twenty
four hours. This pump needs repairs
and general overhauling. There Is one
five-foot Pelton wheel with rope trans
mission to the power station. This
wheel is well housed and in good con
dition. A 14x30 single expansion Cor
liss engine completes the machinery
at this station. This engine has been
out of commission since the installation
of the Pelton wheel, is of an old pat
tern and of no particular value in con
nection with an improved form of sub
stantial water-works machinery.
Collectively speaking, tho entire dis
tribution system shows a want of
unity. Single features have been
| added successively, never with any re
| gard as to a pro-arranged plan, but
evidently as a makeshift, serving the
best it can during the time being.
The main source of r.upply is drawn
from what is termed "Crystal Springs,"

that permanent water rights are glv< n
by the water company to adjoining
land-owners in exchange for such right
i of way.
The rights to develop water are a
mooted question. The city of Los An
geles is at present preparing for the
final struggle In the courts to deter
mine the value of the so-called "Cry
stal Springs" property. It is not in
tended to prejudice this case now or
to anticipate the results of such legal
Investigation. A recital of the facts
anparent to any one visiting the locali
ties, however, may be of Interest in
this matter at the present time.
The water company is entitled to the
use of ten miners' Inches of water
out of the Los Angeles River, ac
cording to the terms of the con
tract with the city, made thirty
years ago. The water company uses
to-day about ISOO miners' inches for
the domestic water supply, as well
as for power to operate their pumps.
The difference of IT9O miners' inches is
supposed to be developed on their
grounds called, euphoniously, "Crystal
Springs." Thr-se "springs," being the
head works of the water company, are
located on land adjacent to and partly
beneath the bed of the Los Angelei
River. The head works cover fifty-four
acres of ground, four acres of which
are owned by the water company,
while the remaining fifty acres are
leased land.
Two lines of 24-inch percolation pipes
laid in the ground, running partly par
allel to the Los Angeles River and 400
feet distant therefrom and partly be
neath the river for a distance of nearly
800 feet, and two other lines of 16-inch
percolation pipes, distant about 2200
feet from the river, begin at the fmir
acre "Crystal Pprings" tract and Join
with the fir.^t line of pipes at the gute
house, from whence the water thus de
veloped discharges into the main con
duit leading toward the city.
How do these percolation pipes oper
ate?
The lines of pipes parallel to and be
neath the river necessarily gather their
water from the saturated sub-strata of
the river bed and drain the water from
the river. The lines of pipes leading off
"Crystal Springs" and being too :ir
away to be materially benefited by the
waters of the Los Angeles River, are,
however, artificially provided with
"spring" and "percolating water" by
means of an open ditch which, drawing
the surface water out of the river, do
posits such water in a wide, shallow
ditch immediately above the "springs,"
saturates the ground, furnishes the
percolating water In any quantity de
sired; a convenient entrance way to
these percolating pipes being provided
by moans of an open pit located on tho
four-acre "Crystal Springs" tract, into
which the Los Angeles River water
flows unhindered.
The following is a summary of the
water works system: The pipe system,
with the exception of all the cast iron
pipes and a few of the newer riveted
Steel pipes, is old, deteriorated and sub
ject to constant repairs and renewals.
Investigation proved a deficit of 46.3
miles of pipe in the water company's
schedule. The water works system
contains two good, serviceable and
well-located reservoirs, while :ill
the other reservoirs are neither
in size, location nor construc
tion fit for more than temporary
use, and need replacing by others. The
power stations are scattered over too
large a territory, and are poorly equip
ped and maintained. With the excep
tion of the Buena Vista plant, they are
too small and housed in poorly con
structed buildings. The machinery Is
old, has seen many years of service, is
of insufficient capacity, In need of re
pairs, and is serviceable only lor tem
porary use. The conduit leading the :
water from the headworks to the Belle
vue reservoir Is of ample size and good
construction. The BuÂ« Vista conduit
is also good and serviceable wherever
tunnel and brick and iron construction
is used. The present covered wooden
flume in connection therewith Is in bad
shape, and needs replacing by other ma
terial, brick or iron. The so-called
power ditch is too small, in poor con
dition throughout. The headworks at
"Crystal Springs" can furnish, by
means of the percolation system, un
der favorable circumstances, 650 min
ers' inches of river water, while, in ad
dition to this, approximately 1250 min
ers' inches of water are taken direct j
from the surface flow of the Los An- I
geles I liver. The darvanza headworks '
furnishes a supply too insignificant to !
| be considered, and the permanency of
which is doubtful.
In the foregoing the vital parts of the
water company's plant . have been
touched upon. Aji estimate was here
tofore pared by order of the City
Council, and careful surveys of all fea
tures of the plant and inspection of, the
water company's books and records, as
well as estimates, bids and offers from
I reliable business firms, were obtained,
and a summary of the estimate, as it
appears in the following abbreviated
form, can be substantiated at any time,
and new estimates made on the basis
j of ascertaining the true value cannot
i possibly vary 5 per cent either way:

The sum of $1,190,605 was offered by
the city to the water works company
for the acquisition of the plant.
The present owners derive a yearly
income of over $440,000, and the maxi
mum yearly expense account for main
tenance does not exceed $100,000. The
company probably rates the value of
their plant upon a revenue basis, while
| the city of Los Angeles rates the value
of the plant upon the specific contract
clause which prescribes a valuation on
improvements made by this company
upon the mother plant owned by the
city originally, and turned over to the
; company at the beginning of their thir
ty years' franchise. Hence the differ

VERY RELUCTANT.
The People of Los Angeles Slow
About Being Bled For Al
most Tv-o Millions.
Now, with this showing of statistical
data before them, is it to be wondered
that the people of the city of Los An
geles decline to pay $3,000,000 for the
plant .-f the City Water Company?
Be it understood that the taxpayer!
and citizens generally .ire ready and
will gladly g-ive to the water company
a fair and equitable price for their
property.
But it Is apparent that they do not
intend to be bled. Nor will they be led
like lambs to the slaughter.
The public servants who betray them
and who accept bounties in order that
they may advance, us private individ
uals iis Hprainst the municipal welfare,
will be gibbeted by public opinion.
The fact that the syndicated local
press falls absolutely In its duty and
tl to criticise the weak, vacil
lating and Inefficient councllroen who
arc delaying the settlement and adjust
ment "f this vital question will not
Rave them from popular contempt.
They will be marked men in the fu
ture, and wherever they go they will be
known for the treachery of which they
have not as yet been found guilty, but
which has been alleged against them,
and for which they are now on trial.
They can yet clear themselves of the
taint which rests upon them, and In a
very easy and simple way.
Firstâ The criticism of the syndicated
trio of Journals must be overlooked.
B "nd â The negotiations with the
water company should be conducted In
a manly way, as if business, and noth
ing but business, was intended, and
with a view not to procrastinate but
to bring about a result.
The manner In which negotiations
have thus far been carried on with
the water company has plainly Indi
cated to the people the purpose of those
Counctlmen, Who have clearly shown
that they were laboring assiduously to
complicate an already complicated
r,uf stion.
There remains but little over five
Bhort months when the contract ex
l'ir.s. The battle that Is to be waged
from now on is one of vital importance,
find upon the outcome the future of
tli â  < ity depends to a large extent.
The time has a^ain come for citizens
to take their coats off and enter the
lists in their own behalf. From the
local press neither aid nor correct in
formation can be expected. The in
fluence of the corporation is great, and
its pv.pporters are thoroughly fortified
behind strong bulwarks. The people
can win if they unite and work to
gether. Will they do so?

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Jan. 16.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: The ex
clusive announcement in the Herald a
few days since that the conference for
the settlement of all outstanding claims '
â¢n Chile and the United States,
negotiated by Mr. Olnoy and pent to
the Senate last winter, had myster
iously failed and lapsed by limitation
because of the failure of the Senate to
sanction the matter, has caused no lit
tle commotion in diplomatic circles.
The conference had as it.s purpose the
revival of the tribunal of 1^93-94, and
the sum involved amounted to more
than $3,000,000. The proposed tribunal
was to adjudicate and settle among
other claims that of the South Ameri
can Steamship Company of Valparaiso
against the United States for detention
and seizure of the steamer Itata in
Chilean waters in 1593. On a point of
law the former commission held in fa
vor of the claimant company, and it
has been intimated that owing to cer
j tain possible contingencies arising out
of our present relations with Spain it
j was deemed desirable by the Senate
Committee on Foreign Relations that
the question of liability for pursuit,
seizure and search at sea outside of the
national jurisdiction be left open for a
time.
Behind the whole subject there is an
interesting train of events disclosed by
the secret archives of the State De
partment now made public. The origi- 'â 
nal conference for the settlement of!
mutual claims was made through the
of Mr. Foster, Secretary of State,
during the last year Of Mr. Harrison's
administration. At that time, the re
lations between Chile and Argentina
-trained, and Mr. Foster touk ad
vantage Of this, leading the Santiago
nment tÂ«> believe that were th-
United States not appeased its moral
support might be given to Argentina.
Benor Errasuris, Minister of Foreign
Relations of Chile, acceded to Mr. Fos
ter's invitation to arbitrate all pending
claims. The conference was signed in
Santiago on August 7, 1892, by Mr.
Egan on behalf of the United States
and by Senor Errazuriz on the part of
Chile. I'nder its terms ratifications
to be exchanged at Washington
within six months.
The State Department received, in
January. U9S, secret information that
though the Chilean Congress and the
powers to exchange ratifications had
k . n drafted and signed by the Presi
dent, the papers were pigeon-holed in
the Santiago foreign office. Mr. Foster
cabled to the legation In Santiago to
inquire about the matter. Assurances
were given that the papers would go on
the next steamer. A few days later
Mr. Foster was advised that they had
missed the steamer. Thus the treaty
would arrive too late for the exchange
of ratifications.
The situation was clear enough. The
relations between Chile and Argentina
were now pleasant and there was no
reason for completing the treaty. The
State Department sent an intimation
to Â«hile that ratifications must be ex
changed, treaty or no treaty, suggest
ing that proper powers be given the
Chilean Minister in Washington by
cable. The Santiago Government, re
alizing that its subterfuge had become
known, cabled thr desired powers.. The
form of exchanging ratifications was
gone through on January 24, though
two copies of the treaty and the pow
ers were not really exchanged until ten
days later. Out of courtesy to Chile the
correspondence was suppressed.

LONDON, Jan. 16.â Right Hon.
Charles Pelham Villiers, member of
Parliament from South Wolverhamp
ton and known as the "Father of the
House of Commons," having sat con
tinuously in the house since 1835, died
at 9 o'clock to-night.
Charles Pelham Villiers was the third
son of Hon. George Villiers. The Lon
don papers on January 4 said that on
the previous day Mr. Villiers celebrated
his ninety-sixth birthday and received
congratulatory messages from all parts
of the kingdom.
In addition to being the oldest mem
ber of the House of Commons he was
'â¢father of the English bar," being ad
mitted at Lincoln in .1^27. Mr. I
stone, seven years the junior of Mr. Vil
liers, entered Parliament two years be
fore him, but while the service of Mr.
Villiera at Westminster had been con
tinuous that of the great Liberal t=:
nun was broken when he retired
the House of Commons. Mr. Villiers
was returned for Wolverhampton three

act by th<- last Parliament of

member of Parliament he was the old

It was in I<?2*>.1 < ?2*>. when George IV was
King and Victoria was a young child,
that he traveled down into Yorkshire
from London and contested Kingston

nea in eulogy of his public service
in connection with the anti-corn law
tnent were delivered by Earl
Granville and Sir Robert Peel.
Notwithstanding his extremely ad
vanced age his memory was singularly
live, and he was able to entertain
his friends for hours at a time with
lively and charming naratives of scenes
in the House of Commons during the
first half of the century. Canning had
lised away eight years before Mr.
Hers entered Parliament, but the
5 often met. He often went to the
use of Commons to hoar Canning
ak and he invariably described him
a wonderful orator.
imong the famous personalities he
ad recall and vividly portray were
â¢ great Sir Robert Peel, Lord Mel
jrne. Lord John Russell, Lord Derby,
Lord Aberdeen, Lord Brougham, the
Duke of Wellington, Daniel O'Connell.
Hume, Grote, and of course, Disraeli.
He always delighted to recall the cir
cumstances in the House when Disra
eli, who was then quite a -young man,
made the celebrated speech in which
he paid that one day the House would
be compelled to listen to him. Among
interesting events which he witnessed
was the attack by the mob on the
House of t*he Duke of Wellington, and
early recalled the excitement over
the Duke's duel in a London suburb
with Lord Winchelsea, which arose out
of his lordship calling the Waterloo
hero a traitor in connection with Ro

SAN RAFAEL, Jan. 16.-A story of
almost inconceivable inhuman treat
ment to a dumb beast comes to-day
from Point Reyes station, and is
brought by Marshal John E. Creed of
Sausalito. Creed to-day journeyed to
Point Reyes with Dr. C. B. Case, sec
retary of the Marin County Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals,
and George Crandell to learn if the re
ports of cruel treatment to calves in
that section were true. Marshal Creed
returned from Point Reyes to-night.
He had placed under arrest Thomas
Irving, Thomas Marshall and Quinto
Codono for cruelty to animals. The
men were released and warrants will
be forwarded from this place to-mor
row or Tuesday, when they will be for
mally brought before a Justice of the
Peace. ,
Some time ago word reached the or

the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
that calves were being strung up alive
in the northern part of Marin County.
and, while hanging from steel hooks,
their throats were cut and their en
trails removed. What the officers found
to-day fully confirmed the reports.
Marshal Creed said:
â¢â¢We visited the slaughter house to
which the cattlemen bring their ani
mals. Every Thursday and Sunday the
animals are killed, and to-day at S
o'clock they commenced. I never wit

thirty or forty live calvos up in this
way and then, after they have been
hanging with their -throats exposed, to
sever their necks one after another,
until the last one is dead."
Dr. Case, the secretary of the society,
reiterated Marshal Creed's story. He
said that they had seen Dr. Cavenough.
the health officer at Point Reyes, and
the doctor said that it was the cleanest
method of billing calves that h? had
ever seen. The physician was surprised
that the officers could see anything
cruel in the proceeding.
Dr. Case telephoned from Point Reyes
late this afternoon to District Attorney
E. B. Martinelli and received instruc

procedure in the matter of the arrests.

PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 16. - The
body of five-year-old Percy Lockyar,
Is believed to have been mur
dered on Friday night by 15-year-old
Samuel Henderson, was to-day found
ir. the bottom of "ReddieV Creek, at
Fixth and Catharine streets, and there
poems little doubt in the minds of the
police that young Henderson is guilty
of the crime. H-^ is now locked in a
cell at police headquarters. Th<> body
of thÂ« child, wh^n found, was weighted
by two heavy stones, one about his
neck and the other around his ankles.
Hla skull was crushed la and there was
a knife thrust just above the heart and
similar wounds on his breast, side and
forehead, while on one side- of his face
was a long cut extending from below
the eye to the chin.
from what th^ police have been able
to learn, the crime seeuta to have been
one of the most horrible character,
and. if all details are true, it stamps
young Henderson as v degenerate of
the worst type. Testerday after his
arrest, he admitted a knowledge of the
knife thrust, but said that it was due
to the child accidentally running
against an open knife. Henderson be
came alarmed at this, he said, and
threw the body into the creek. To
day, however, when shown the muti
lated body of the child, he admitted
that he was responsible for the other
but he still persisted th^t
11 a an accident.
Thf ' poli â¢â  it was a planned
murder in which the guilty one pur
posed ending the life of another small
boy, Willie Addison, aged seven years.
Henderson, it is claimed, has * be.-n
reading trashy novels of the wild west
stamp, and has shown a desire to
the ""heroes" of those tales.
Th<=> police assort that Henderson ac
companied Lockyar and Addlson to
the woods, as he told yesterday, but
Instead of any accident happening to
either, Henderson tipd both children to
a tree. Addison broke away and ran
home. It was then, it is said, that
young Lockyar's murder was accom
; â¢1. Dr. Morten, the <"oroner's
physician, who explained the thrust
above the heart, said that it caused
the death of the little fellow.
The police searched for the body dur
ing all of last night, and it was not
until after daylight this morning that
it was found. Henderson will be
given a hearing to-morrow morning. A
fact that has come out in connection
â¢with Henderson's alleged crime is that
his father, John D. Henderson, was on
trial before Judge Reed in October.

Christopher Nelson. The killing was
the outcome of a quarrel. Henderson

WEDDED ON AN
OCEAN WAVE
Sausalito Justice Conducts
a Marriage Service
at Sea.
Between His Sea-Sick Spells
He Makes a Couple Man
and Wife.
Mary Campbell and M. S. Seibert
Evade the Divorce Lawa of
the State.
Special Dlsrateh to The Call.
SAITSALITO. Jan. 16.â There was a
romantic marriage on the hiph seas to
day, and Justice Rellrude of Sausalito,
who has grown gray In service on the
bench, officiated and a stranj?er scene
was never witnessed. The Justice long
since passed the half-century mark,
and though he once could withstand
the rolling of old ocean, the peculiar
sensations of the sea now affect him.
To-day the Justice suddenly pave way
to his feelings as he was performing:
the ceremony th;it made a love-rick
couple man and wife.
Mary Campbell had been the wife of
a man named Burns and had procured
a divorce from him last December.
Then Mary Campbell, who preferred
her maiden name for reasons best
known to herself, fell in love with ML
S. Seibert, whose residence is on Sec
ond street in the metropolis, and the
grew apace as the days went by.
Both resolved that the law which the
Legislature had framed to the effect
that people who had been divorced
could not marry within a year was "
bit of foolishness. To circumvent it
they decided to brave the ocean's
wrath and the law's also, and so they
came to Sausalito and hired the swift
tug Gazelle from Charles Forrest and
put to sea.
It was 12.30 o'clock to-day when the
tug, with the party on board, s.'t out.
In the party were Mary Campbell, the
bride-to-be; M. S. Seibert, the happy
groom; Justice J. S. Bellrude of Sausa
lito, and H. Nelson, the engineer and
captain of the little tug. over the
bounding waves, through the Golden
Gate and to a point far beyond the
three-mile limit, the little tug swept.
To the surprise of all the Justice grew
sick at heart and the luncb he partook
of before he left the peaceful port took
occasion to distress him mightily.
When the captain believed he had
reached the limit of the l*nit"d States'
jurisdiction he informed the little party
and the ceremony of Joining Campbell
and Seibert in holy wedlock was per
formed. Justice Bellrude opened his
mouth and commenced to utter the ste
reotyped words and the couple stood up
in the rocking boat to hear , when sud
denly in the middle of the service the
Justice experienced an attack thai left
him speechless. He tried hard to resist
the ocean's tempest but failed, and in
fits and starts performed the ceremony.

STRAINED RELATIONS OF
CHILE AND ARGENTINA.
Recent Diplomatic Disclrsures That Tend to
Increase the Possibilities of War.
NEW YORK, Jan. 16.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Little
surprise is expressed in diplomatic cir
cles at the announcement that Argen
tina and Chile are on the verge of war.
The friction between the two govern
ments has been recently very great. It
is known here that the hostile attitude
of Argentina toward Chile in 1892, In
offering the United States permission to
use Its territory for warlike purposes
against Chile, became known to the
Chilean Government only very recently,
and the latter, it is said, has excellent
information concerning the whole af
fair. The history of the intrigue was
told in the Herald of Monday last, and
caused something of a sensation
among the Latin-American diplomats.
The Chilean Government is Incensed
j over the disclosures, and it is believed
j when the facts rÂ«-ach the Chilean pub
lic the situation may become even more
i grave.
Minister Gan, the diplomatic repre
i sentative of Chile in Washington, could
: not be seen ta-night, but his son told
me that his father had no advices that
; Chile was preparing to go to war with
, Argentina, and did not believe the re
| port. The State Department has been
informed, however, that the relations
between Chile and Argentina have been
mu^h strained, and no surprise would
. be felt If war should result.

GODS' PENALTIES
SELF INFLICTED
Dr. Jordan of Stanford on
the Cause of Human
Misery.
Man Prone to Selfishness and
Disregard of the Laws
of Right.
"Carries in His Own Breast the Key
to Hits Own HÂ»Hven or His
Own Hell."
' Dlspatr-h to The Tall.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Jan. 1&
The announcement that Dr. Jordan
would deliver this morning's sermon
overcrowded the cfa&pe] with students,
who were desirous of learning mm-.- of
their 's religious views. The
subject Of the sermon was "The Hu
man Reaction." Pr. Jordan prefaced
his remarks by saying:
"Lincoln once said that he would
walk one thousand miles to Join a
church which believed In God and hu
manity. As a humble member, it may
be, of some such church I would speak
to you."
He first showed how the tendencies
to worship humanity arose In the rev
elations of power that made for right
eottsncss and come to us from the lives
and acts of other men, who were the
sons of God incarnate in the human
flesh and a part of our common hu
manity. The reason that men had
never been content to worship human
ity as God was ascribed to the
that they recognised a larger responsi
bility than thai Of man.
"Man," he said, "the last of the ani
mal creation on earth, is not the first
cause of his own creation. He can
claim no credit for his own deveVop
nn-nt. Man, therefore, cannot worship
himself. He knows that whatever he
does of goodness or of wisdom was
good or wise before he did it; that .L"">d
or wise action on his part is but fol
lowing in liti" with the great tendeni les
and purposes In the universe which ex
ist'-ii before man, and by virtue of
which man came to exi^t. It is not the
work Of humanity but of Qod in hu
manity, and this only can man wor
ship."
After speaking of how slow p
were t<> recognise that nature had her
own laws and purposes and that she
was not the executor of human justice,
he added:
"We smile at the sealous clergyman
who tin diets the destruction of San
Francisco by material earthquakes, be
cause ( .f her moral and political delin
quencies. We stand aghast at tli" bias
phemy of the clergyman in Pittsburg
who found in the death of a fireman,
in a burning storehoui â  In Chicago, â 
punishment for the opening of tl.
position on Sunday. God's penalties
are self-inflicted, for the forces that
punish sin are innate in the heart of
nan. Every man carries in his own
breast the key to his own heaven or his
own hell.
"Much <>f human misory," hp contln
uÂ« <1. "comes from th<- belief that nature
owes us ;t living; that somehow or
other who "UL'in to make an exception
in our favor. Most rascals consider
themselves privileged characters. The
laws <>:' ri;;ht were intended, for some
one else.* 1
The spirit, he believed, that made
each nation think Itself tin- favored <>f
Qod and each little sect "f Chrtsttans
advance its claims of on soil <<r an
other to the true apostolic success loii,
was a phase of human selfishness.
"Man," he said, "projected his little
epoism out on the face "f nature."
Prayer, he thought, was th<- expies
sion of what might be called "human
reaction"â the force which caused man
to resist gravitation, which pulled
man toward th" ground. In conclu
sion, he said, "Right and wrong exist
in human conduct. All Hse in the uni
verse is merely truth. Thus it may be
In the universe. God is truth, while
within man Cud is love, and love and
truth ;ii: b and ri^ht are at
c and Indivisible."

Handsome Bessie Anderson's Adven

Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Jan. 16.â Miss Bessie An
derson, the belle of Tacoma, escaped
from her home last evening while de
lirious, went to the old Tacoma wharf,
two miles distant, and Jumped off Into
the bay. John Burns, a longshoreman,
heard the splash when she struck the
water. He called for help, got a rope
and plunged i n after her.v She had been
In the water nearly fifteen minutes
when he succeeded in getting a rope
ab<>ut her and rescuing her.
A strong ebb tide was running, and
Miss Anderson, who is an expert swim
mer, was paddling with her hands out
toward the sea when he caught her.
Her clothing, together with her pad
dling buoyed her up until help arrived;
otherwise she would not now be resting
easily at the Fannie Paddock Hospital,
with indications pointing to her speedy
recovery.
Miss Anderson was taken ill with
fever two weeks ago. Being of a strong
constitution, the fever made but slight
inroads, except to create In her an un
controllable desire to get out of the
house. This feature of her illness
caused a strict watch to be placed on
her by her mother and brother. On
Friday night the latter kept vigil over
his sist.r. ami more than onCe had
hard work to keep her in the house.
Early last evening he was in the draw
ing-room with her, when, upon the pre
text that she wished to speak to her
mi >t her, she left the room.
She had no soobjÂ£T closed the door
than Mr. Anderson surmised her pur
pose, and, hurrying to the door, learned
that she had gone rut. Search was
Instituted, but proved unsuccessful
until, Just after he had notified the po
lice, a telephone message announced
Miss Anderson's rescue at Old Tacoma,
She was hurried to the hospital in a
hack. It is thought she had previously
determined to g" to the pound and
plunge in, probably belfevlng, In her
delirium, that that was the best way
to shake off the fever.
Miss Anderson is a daughter of Gen
eral Adna Anderson, deceased, a promi

ment of the army during the Civil War.
She is a beautiful blonde of athletic
build, a leader at tennis, golf and ey

NO PERMANENT CHANGE IN
MR. SHORTRIDGE' S CONDITION
Illness of the San Jose Editor Still Critical,
and There /s No Hope That He
Will Recover.
SAN JOSE, Jan. IR.â There was some
improvement durinp the day in the con
dition of Charles M. Shortridge, who is
at the Gllroy Hot Springs, but it was of
brief duration. The cause of his relapse on
Friday was the development of symptoms
.of typhoid fever, which, owing to his
weakened state, rendered his condition
alarming. Mrs. C. M. Shortridge and his
brother, Samuel M. Shortridge, are with
him.
Because the symptoms of typhoid fevi r
have developed the case is deemed hope
less. Mr. Shortridge being too much
weakened by illness to be able to stand
a long siege, which he would have to
underpo before recovering from an at
tack of typhoid. The attending physi
cian looks for a relapse and death, which
may occur within the next twenty-four
hours.

MARKED IMPROVEMENT IN TRADE.
THE spring demand for merchandise has al
ready set in, n we are to judge by the
bank clearings of the country, which gained
37.6 per cent last week, the largest gain for a long
time. This is all the more encouraging in that it
is not often that this demand sets in so early. It us
ually makes its appearance about the first of Feb
ruary, and for several years has not appeared at all.
There is evidently a general disposition to go into
business much more heavily than usual, which in
dicates confidence in the future. Indeed, Brad
street's Financial Review says that "Both specula
tion and investments have been active during the
past week. The best feature of thr market has
been the very heavy dealings in bonds at generally
higher prices, both for the high grade and new and
more speculative classes. Transactions, rising as
they have to $34,000,000 or $35,000,000 of bonds on
the Stock Exchange, with the trading distributed
among an unusually large number of different is
sues, would indicate a large demand for invest
ments and the growth of confidence in regard to
the position and future of the market."
One of the leading reasons for this augmented
business on the New York Stock Exchange is the
marked increase in railroad earnings, which were
over $43,300,000, in December, a gain of 10.5 per
cent over 1897, and which, in fact, were the largest
earnings in the history of American railroads. The
iron furnaces also report an increased output, and
orders in this branch of trade are unusually large
for this time of the year. The woolen manufac
turers are also buying wool heavily and have a rush
of orders to fill from now on. The cotton manu
facturers, on the contrary, have been overloaded
by excessive production, and find no increase in the
demand or gain in prices. The commercial fail
ures continue to decrease, those last week being 323,
against 479 for the same week in 1897 and 412 in
1896. Wheat exports have fallen off, owing purely
to the usual holiday dullness in Europe, and not to
any decrease in the demand itself; but corn ex
ports have increased 1,000.000 bushels during the
past week. The distributive trade throughout the
country is good, and whatever tendency is exhib
ited in prices is upward rather than downward.
The local situation shows no particular change,
if we except the demand for merchandise for Alaska
which has now fairly opened and is steadily increas
ing. We are getting our share of this business up
to date, and will probably continue to get it with
the exercise of ordinary commercial enterprise. It
is too rich a plum to be allowed to slip through our
fingers. It is not a transient, but a permanent
trade, and if properly fostered by j>tir local mer
chants will increase the wholesale business of this
port by millions of dollars annually.
The erratic character of the rains keeps local trade
very unsettled. Showers are succeeding each other
with sufficient rapidity, but except along the imme
diate coast they do not amount to much. The pro
tracted cold snap has kept back the growing grain
and the outlook for a large crop is not as bright as
it might be. Still, with a fair precipitation from
now on an average harvest will probably Be secured.
The cereal market reflects the uncertainty, and the
different grains are becoming very sensitive. Wheat
remains about the same, but barley is steadily ad
vancing and feed has now got up to $1 per cental,
which is. over the average price of late years. Oats,
too, are rising, and hay moves up a notch every
few days. If the present lack of moisture continue?
there is no knowing where hay and the local grains
will go. But good rains would keep them down
to reasonable values, and here is where the uncer
tainty comes in. The same conditions are affect
ing merchandise, as country dealers are cautious
about laying in heavy stocks until they have a fair
idea of how the crops are going to turn. out. The
matter will probably be settled one way or the other
shortly, when values will become better defined.
But a short grain crop this year will not prove a*
serious a calamity as in some former years. Time**
are now so improved that a deficiency in the crop
is certain to be made up in greatly enhanced values.
However, from present indications, there will be no
serious shortage.
Naturally the courts are puzzled as to what to do
with three youthful footpads who proclaim their
cuilt and seem to glory in it. They nre too tender
of years to be sent to prison, and would have a bad
influence at a boy's reformatory. There seems to
be nothing to do but regret that the man whom
they robbed failed to suddenly reform them with a
pistol.
It is not to be assumed now that the United
States will be forced to take action ns to the affairs
of Cuba. The probability that Spain will sail into
Key West and proceed to annex Florida, or even
that it will storm the City Hall of New York, is
happily remote. Nothing less radical would be apt
to arouse Uncle Sam to a sense of outraged dig
nity.
KEEPING FAITH-
IN our New Era issue we announced certain prin
ciples which it seemed to us should govern those
who control newspapers and command the pub
licity which goes with such control.
The policy announced was one of fairness and
justice and truthfulness toward all Interests and all
individuals.
Many who read and approved this declaration
were skeptical as to the realization of such a policy.
They believed, in the first place, that the public taste
had been so trained up to the rank and the raw in
journalism, by the yellow and sensational press,
that a paper which gave the minimum of news space
to the ignoble doings of ignoble people, and the
maximum of legitimate literature and news and edi
torial opinion and encouragement of what is clean
and manly and womanly in life, would not get ade
quate support. It was also insisted that the busi
ness community was subject to so many blackmail
schemes laid by the sensational press that it had lost
courage by having no paper ready to defend it
against misrepresentation and robbery. In proof of
this was cited the repeated exposures of one morn
ing paper in forgeries, in sophisticarion of news, in
the printing of letters which were never written to
it upon subjects of current interest, raising the pre
sumption that in all things it was equally false and
unreliable.
Events have turned these doubts. The Call has
kept on the course set for itself. We said that in
this State the interests of the producer must be con
sidered. Our exposure of his unfair treatment in
the manipulation of prison jute bags is in line with
that declaration. We impute no criminal intent to
the prison directors. The jute law was drawn by
a farmer, in the interest of prison discipline, of free
labor and of the fanners. Prison discipline is a
hopeless problem if convicts are not furnished occu
pation. Any form of manufacture that outputs a
prison product in competition with the product o<
free labor is objectionable. The Ostrom law wal
in right line with penological science and econo
mics, and while these were served the farmer was
made the beneficiary. Farmers take so little bene
fit from statutes and other classes take so much,
that this law may be characterized as a stroke of
genius, for what benefit it gave the farmer was nol
at the expense of any one else. The directors seem
to have misapprehended this high purpose of the
statute, and as a result the producer has been treated
unfairly and benefits intended to reach him have
been arrested, midway, and absorbed by a class no?
comprehended in the law at all. In tolerance o?
spirit and temperance of language The Call has
simply kept faith with the producers of the State, a?
it proposes to do with all classes, interests and in
dividuals. It is pleasant to know by the accumu
lating experience of each day, that this fidelity i?
appreciated and rewarded by the business com
munity.
THE GOLDEN JUBILEE EDITION.
NEXT Sunday the Golden Jubilee edition of
The Call will be given to the public. It is
to consist of forty-four pages, will be pro
fusely illustrated in the highest excellence of news
paper art and supplied with brilliantly illuminated
covers. It will contain a record of the mining in
dustry of the Pacific Coast from Mexico to Alaska
and will be the most comprehensive and accurate
compilation ever made on that subject.
A notable feature of the edition will be the
number of mining experts and established author
ities on mining matters who will contribute to its
columns. It is not to be a paper made up of the
careless productions of hack writers, but a sympo^
sium on mines and mining by accomplished special
ists, each of whom will write on departments of
work in which he has had practical experience as
well as scientific knowledge.
The edition is designed to serve as a journalistic
accessory to the Golden Jubilee and the mining ex
position. It will cover both the history of mining
in California which the Jubilee celebrates, and the
conditions of the industry throughout the Coast,
which the exposition will exhibit. It will there
fore serve the general public as a species of elabor
ate textbook on each of these subjects and will be
valuable to all who desire to obtain an intelligent
understanding of what mining was in 1849 and what
it is to-day.
The fact that the edition is to be devoted to min
ing only, instead of trying to cover all the indus
tries of the State, will add to its value as an issue
pertinent to the time and the opportunity. At this
juncture the whole country is excited on gold mines
and gold mining. The Call's special edition will
give full information on every branch of that great
industry. Placer, quartz and hydraulic mining will
be treated comprehensively by men who under
stand them, and all who wish information up to
date concerning gold mining on any part of the
coast from Alaska to Mexico will find it in the Jub
ilee edition of The Call next Sunday.
According to an evening paper only one out of
four celebrated murderers of this city has succeeded
in escaping in the last twenty years. The qualifying
adjective utterly spoils the beauty of this record.
Just what characteristics a murder must possess to
make it 'â¢celebrated" is not a matter of common
knowledge. But the fact remains unshaken that
during the period named scores of murderers have
escaped either through avoiding arrest or through
turning the courts for the nonce into farcical tribu
nals apparently designed to shield crime. Two
sample instances may be cited, both recent. One was
the murder of Ware and the other that of Policeman
Grant. The first assassin never came to li^ht and
the second might as well never have been caught, as
the trial amounted to an expensive and elaborate
process of letting him go again.
It was a mean trick for a contortionist back East
to cultivate the faculty of throwing his hip out of
joint and then keep involving himself in railway ac
cidents so that he could do this to the despoliation
of some innocent company. Yet there is some com
fort in the thought that the railroads have knocked
many a hip out of joint and not put up a cent.
It was a neat idea for an actress in Chicago to have
a Spanish sympathizer shoot at her. She is appearing
as a Cuban heroine, and nothing could be more
fitting than that hot Castilian blood should do a
little spectacular boiling. Besides, the cost of blank
cartridges is a trifle. One could better afford to buy
them than to lose even paste diamonds.
It is an interesting fact that a confidence man who
was sent from Kansas City by the police turned up
in Greater New York, where he at once became a
politician. It was while acting in the latter capacity
that he got into jail. This simple incident shows
that when a confidence man starts on a downward
course he may expect trouble.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JAKUABY 17, 1898.
THE WEEK OF PREPARATION.
A WEEK remains in which to prepare for the
Golden Jubilee. It will be a time of cease
less activity on the part of all who are charged
witli the responsibility of any feature of the great
festival, and so far as the public can give assist
ance in the way of work or money, it should be cor
dially and liberally done.
San Francisco cannot afford to fail in any part
of this undertaking. The festival has been adver
tised far and wide, and hosts of visitors with great
expectations will be in the city to share in the
pleasures of the occasion and enjoy the glories of
the pageant. It therefore behooves all who have
my feeling of civic patriotism and pride in San
Francisco to co-operate in the task of decorating
the streets and adding to the splendid beauty of
the entertainment which is to be provided in cele
1 ration of the golden day.
The programme of the festival has been well ar
ranged. It contains many features of interest to all
classes of persons. It will be the most notable pa
rade ever given in the State and the most magnifi
cent. It will be accompanied moreover by sports
and games, by floral fetes and by balls and enter
tainments. San Francisco will be !n gala attire
and joyous, mood, and virtually the whole week fol
lowing Jubilee day will be given up to pleasure and
the business that pleasure entails.
One of the most promising features of the pro
gramme of entertainment is that of the floral carni
val at Union Square. It was a happy thought on
the part of the ladies who designed it. Among all
the attractions of San Francisco none are fairer
than those of her midwinter flowers. In the mul
titude of bright blossoms that adorn the gardens of
the city we have the most beautiful and most con
vincing witnesses of the mildness of our January
air and the geniality of our climate. It is right
and fitting that these flowers should have a promi
nent place in the festival and it is to be hoped that
profuse contributions will be made to the display
that is to beautify Union Square and make it ra
diant 'for all the world to see.
While so much is being done in the way of public
work for the celebration, much remains for private
enterprise and individual taste to do. Every build
ing along the line of march should be made brilliant
with banners and gay festoons. The occasion is
one on which each citizen may vie with his neigh
bor in generous emulation to see which can design
and achieve the most striking and gorgeous effect.
A week remains- for tl/e work, but the time will pass
rapidly. Begin the preparations to-day.
AN IMMEDIATE REMEDY WANTED.
PUBLIC indignation aroused by the many acci
dents caused by the almost criminal carelessness
with which the street cars of the city are run,
demands an immediate remedy for the evil. Such
demands when made in the past have been ignored,
because the people did not persistently urge them.
1 his time the demand is serious, earnest and per
sistent. It cannot be overlooked nor neglected.
As a matter of course a reasonable time must be
permitted for the selection of proper fenders and
proper brakes. No one expects the Supervisors to
compel the companies to take the first things of the
sort that are offered. This does not mean, how
ever, that the companies may dally along making
trials and experiments forever, and leaving their cars
still dangerous to the safety i f every person who
crosses the streets.
A reasonable time under the circumstances cannot
be justly construed to mean a long time. The issue
is not a new one. It has been under consideration
in every city in the Union where trolley cars are
operated, and even in this city itself the subject has
been discussed for years. Many tests with fenders
and brakes have been made and a large amount of
information as to the merits of various appliances is
immediately available. It ought to T>e easy there
fore to decide upon the adoption of some remedy
within a comparatively short time.
There can be no doubt that if the proposed safety
devices were of a nature that would make the opera
tion of the roads more economical and more profita
ble to their owners, the managers would not take
months of experiment and other months of dis
cussion before adopting them. It does not take
business men a lifetime to make a change in
methods of work when there is money in the
change, nor should it take the street car companies
a lifetime to adopt safety appliances on their cars
when lives are at stake.
Both the street car companies and the Supervisors
might as well understand at once that the p^crt
demand for a remedy will not pass away and be for
gotten in a few days because of popular interest in
other things. They may as well understand also
that the people cannot be put off much longer by
promises of compliance at some future time, not by
making a show of testing new devices in fenders.
If neither the companies nor the Supervisors can
devise a means of protecting citizens from the reck
less methods of operation now in use, perhaps the
Grand Jury might find some way to quicken their
wits a little.
It is not a regrettable fart that a scorching bicy
clist is in jail. lie did not intend to kill anybody
no scorcher does so intendâ but he was entirely
willing that the world afoot should take its chances.
He conceived it to be the duty of the pedestrian to
dodge, but failed to make allowance for the aped
and infirm. Therefore he is locked up to await a
demonstration of his power as a missile. If his vic
tim die the scorcher will learn that his sort do not
make up the whole world, a bit of information
which may cause him to lead a better life and
promote longevity among the wheeilcss.
Somebody in the East has gone to the trouble of
suggesting Van Wyck for President in 1900. The
gentleman might be an excellent one. but as he has
yet to prove that he is equal to being a good Mayor
for Croker there seems no occasion for haste. How
ever, the people of this country will hardly be ready
to accept Croker as their chief executive, no matter
how the complacent New Yorker may feel about it.
Japan has done this country the honor to fine
the sailors who amused themselves by killing some
tars of the American navy. Complaint is made that
the punishment is not severe enough. Yet the fact
must be remembered that an assassin in this coun
try is seldom even fined. He is simply tried, and
the people foot the bills, or, in other words, pay the
fine.
The Seminoles did not go on the warpath, but they
could be excused if they were to do so just long
enough to secure the scalp of the liar who sent out
a report that they had.
Spain, says an exchange, is ripe for revolt. This
is probably true. In fact, Spain shows some symp
toms of being over-ripe.
INDIVIDUAL THOUGHTS,
BY A MODEST CRITIC.
A distinguished jurist asks me to
show that the Hawaiian Islands, "in
stead of being strategically of value to
us, will be a Constant source of weak
ness." I regret that the request came
so late. The space at my command is
limited, and it is a matter that cannot
be treated in a few lines. Neverthe
less, with gladness the courtesy s-hail
be extended next week.
The chairman of the Senate Com
mittee on Foreign Relations has saidâ
If we may rely oh the telegraphic re
port â that the possession of the Sand
wich group. In case v,ar, "would be
equal to eight or ten battle-ships." This
seems almost incredible; but assuming
It to be true, in what way, may I ask
this distinguished gentleman, does he
see this wondrous value? Does he
imagine that territory fightsâ that the
possession of land Is war material?
As pointed out by Mr. Josenh Cham
berlain, one of England's ablest states
men, the other day. the acquisition of
territory Implies its protection. We can
protect these Islands after annexinr
them In two ways only: We can for
tify them and make the largest of the
group impregnable at an exp -rise of
two or three hundred of millions of dol
lars; we can build ten battle-ships at
an expense of fifteen or twenty million
dollars, and they can be detailed to
watch our precious territory, our own
coasts being unprotected. Both plans
are so evidently foolish that it futlgues
to even think of them. But one of them
must be adopted if we insist on this an
nexation scheme.
Mr. Reed has explained lucidly
enough that "empire can wait." He
should have gone further. Until we
can protect our coasts efficiently em
pire MUST wait.
Freely translated, therÂ« is a French
proverb which reads, "Those in need
of succor hide in curious holes." The
Examiner is an example. Driven to
despair on the ever present question of
Hawaiian annexation, it now vows that
the scheme is advisable on humani
tarian grounds. What next? This Is
exactly what it says:
"The Hawaiian Islands have a ca
pacity for becoming one of the most
productive spots on the earth. That
they have not achieved this results
Bolely from their lack of development
in the methods of Western civilisation.
They have made some advance of late
-. but it lias been slow and labored
I ired with what it will lie under
the free institutions of this country.
The annexation of the Islands is a duty
that is the highest of all duties â a duty
owed In the name of humanity."
The execrable English may be over
looked, but where, it is asked, did this
nation get its mission to provide for
humanity generally? The annexation
of the whole of the South Sea Islands
logically follows if we make the Sand
wich group an Integral part of this
Union on humanitarian principles. It
is casting pearls before swine to point
this out to the "yellow fellow." though.
He is a poser â not a logician.
A couple of interior papers have ob
jected to the broad statement that "to
admit Mr. Charles E. Naylor'a right to
talk on pilotage is absurd." Both -
ly think it ne^ds con** rotation, and as
Mr. Naylor has been v- od enough to
supply the necessary Indorsement, there
Beema to be no good reason for -with
holding the publicity which the Over
land could not give. In that magazine
(the current number), Mr. Naylor ar
gues for "A Fed ral Riot Service.** 1
think I know what he means by that;
but those who read English critically
might doubt. Mr. Xa lor evidently
wishes Congress to enact a lnw which
will place the Bervices of pilots â the
ts over â under Federal supervision.
It has ever been the avowed object of
our Government to get as far away
from paternalism as p ssible when
prudent. And it is not only prudent,
but undeniably sensible that States
should keep as direct control of 'heir
pilots as they do <>f their wharfingers.
Mr. Naylor sees in the words, "Until
further provision is made by Con
i that the national legis
lative bodies seriously Intended to in
terfere with what is. of course, merely
a local matter. The phraseology occurs
more than a score of times in the Re
vised Statutes. At the time when sec
tion 42SS was enacted the Union was
scarcely on a firm basis, ami none of
us knew exactly what was going to
occur next. The Wisdom of the provi
sion is admitted, and the fact that
Congress has declined again and again
to interfere in the matter of local
pilotage is fair proof that the present

There can be and there Is no doubt In the mind of any patriotic and disin

that this Hawaiian scheme is a tissue of iniquities, past, present and future.
Wherever you look fit it you find tho same warp and woof. For instance,
the San Francisco Call directs attention to this extract from the report of La
bor Commissioner FLtzffcrakl:
-My investigations through the Hawaiian Islands have brought to my at
tention many new conditions and phases of labor, the most important of which
Is the Asiatic hordes which now infest the Islands and predominate in num
bers upon the plantations. I have seen 20,000 barefooted laborers, half of whom
work under v penal contract; I have seen rewards offered for their arrest
when they violated their contract and deserted the plantation, with their num
ber printed across their photograph in convict style."
Such are the normal and practically universal conditions of labor in this
remote group of islands which Is being "jammed" Into our Union.
wise not to expel Dr. Hirschfelder, who
sensibly believes that diseases of the
lungs can be guarded against. The
conclusion was wise, but the exclusion
of Dr. d'Evelyn from the same club is
not explicable. Dr. d'Evelyn has dis
coveredâor thinks he hasâ a method of
inoculation which will destroy the
love of alcoholic tranquillity. If he has
not, his efforts have been very dis
tinctly praiseworthy. Moreover, it will
not be very surprising if his theory of
alcocytes turns out to be quite accu
rate. What may I ask is the ethical
difference between finding a remedy for
phthisis and alcoholism?
Grover Cleveland of unhallowed
memory has exhibited his lack of "bal
ance" again. He is now in evidence
pleading to the Governor of California
for mercy for Salter D. Worden. He
urges it with no more reason than
could have been uttered on behalf of
Durrant, who, it is cheering to know,
has been "heard to cease." If Worden
is guilty of the crime charged, hanging
is his just due. This is not an instance
in which the belravior of the Southern
Pacific Company can be considered in
any way. That has no bearing what
ever on the justice of the sentence if
the man be guilty. In cases of this
sort it is irrational to talk of the "high
ly Inflamed state of the public mind,"
of the suggestion that "he was the tool
of others" and last, but not least, that
he was "drunk" when he committed
the crime. These and a half dozen
other halting excuses have been made
in this man's behalf. Whoever removed
the fish-plate which caused the derail
ing of the train which sent brave men
to death chose a spot where he knew
full well fatal results would ensue.
Had the attempt to wreck that particu
lar train been made where there was
at any rate a possibility of no lives be
ing lost, the action (vile though that
would have been) might perhaps tem
per justice with mercy; but the spot
chosen for the wreck clearly shows the
mind of a fiend. Threats were freely
made by the strikers that any train
leaving Sacramento could never reach
Oakland in safety. It is said that care
was taken to have this information cir
culated among the United States troops
4s well as due diligence being exer
cised to let each engineer and train
hand know what was intended.
Whether the poor fellows who met
death in the wreck expected it or not
it is impossible to say, but it is prac
tically certain that they knew their
peril to be as great as was that of the
Gordon Highlanders about whose hero
ism, when in the fire zone, we have
heard so much recently.
The United States soldiers who sac
rificed their lives on that occasion lie
buried beneath a shaft which says
"Murdered by strikers." I respect the
moral courage of the man who ordered
the inscription, and still more do I ad
mire the determination that kept the
truth on that shaft when personal vio
lence was openly threatened if the ob
noxious words were not erased.
On "VTorden's behalf it has been
promised again and again that he
would reveal the men who were actu
ally the instigators of this crime. The
promises have never been kept. He
stands to-day in the identical position
that he did when tried. If Worden is
guilty he should hang; if he be innocent
he should be freed.

NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
The French Admiralty contemplates
large expenditures upon its naval sta
tions abroad. At Bizerta, in Tunis, a
breakwater and two drydocks, costing
from $3,000,000 to $3,500,000, are to be built.
In Corsica the naval authorities propose
to build a boom in the port of Ajaccio
and the army department to put up two
batteries as 'a defense for what is in
tended as a shelter for torpedo-boa_ts.
At Dakar, Madagascar, the sum of $50,
000 is to be expended on works in contem
plation.
The Don Alvaro de Bazan, a gunboat
recently launched at Ferrol for the
Spanish navy, is a somewhat ambitious
naval design. The vessel is 236 feet 3
inches in length, 27 feet 1 inch beam and
displaces only 828 tons. Her two triple
expansion engines are calculated to give
4600 horse-power under forced draught
and a speed of 20 knots. The armament
is composed of two 4.7-inch quick-firing
guns, four iv.-inch, two machine guns
and three torpedo tubes. The usefulness
of the vessel will be extremely limited,
owing to the small quantity of coal she
is able to carry.
The Kostroma of the Russian volunteer
fleet, which ran on the Elba reef in the
Red Sea last November, had up to De
cember 17 not yet got afloat. Great ef
forts had been made by the steamer
Petersburg of the same fleet, aided by a
steamer from Port Said and a British
torpedo-boat destroyer, to pull the Kos
troma off, but without success, and as a
last resort the torpedo-boat was arrang
ing to blow up portions of the reef. The
stranded steamer is a single-screw of 7975
tons displacement and 14 knots speed,
and was built in England in ISSS.
The gathering of naval vessels in Asi
atic waters will be of such a magnitude
as will long be remembered. On Decem
ber 14 there were thirty-eight Britisn
war ships of all classes, and since then
the Powerful has arrived from Singa
pore and the Edgar and Arrogant are due
within a month. Seventeen Russian ships
were hovering about the coast of China,
and the armored cruiser Rossia of 12.130
tons, just completed, left St. Petersburg
for the long voyage to the Orient. The
seven French war vessels will be fur
ther Increased by the Isly and Alger, due
in one month, and Germany's fleet of six
vessels will have added to it the cruiser
Ka.lserin Augusta, which was at Singa
pore December 13, and the battle-ship
Deutschland and cruiser Gefion, both of
which loft Kiel December 16. The United
States squadron of five ships will also
be ro-enforced by one or more vessels,
and within two months there will thus
be no less than eighty-three ships-of-war
under five national flags. These, with
the representative ships of Japan's navy
around the disputed territory in Kiao

show, equaled only by that at Spithead

J. DEAN'S WELL-BRED CONNEMARA, WHO WON THE STAKE.
MONEY FLOWED
AT INGLESIDE
Sports Kept the Pool-Sel

the Day.
Hares and Hounds in Earnest,
and a Happy Crowd
Looked On.
Moondyne, Diana, Tod Sloan and
Connemara Were in Splen
did Form.
The sports were ou* in force yester
day at the Ingleside coursing grounds,
and the manner In which they plunged
was proof positive that they were on
to the twists and turns of the fleet dogs
which started. The day was rather
raw, but as large a crowd as usual was
present. Gaily dressed women lent
color and animation to the scene, and
children mingled with the gathering.
Ed Conlan and Ed Thies have proved
themselves to be second Itiley Gran
nans, with the cxi eption that EUley
was a judge of horses, while the parties
named drew no dividing lin.
betting between hounds, horses or
hares is concerned. Harry Hrennan,
connected with the park, was in evi
dence, and was closely questioned as
to the chances of this and that hound,
and "dipped" correctly with one or two
exceptions.
Louis Metzer, Teddy Osbourne and
Captain F. W. Warren helped to keep
the pool-sellers busy, and Jockey
".Midget" O'Connor, the feather-weight
rider of the coast, was seemingly anx
ious to try his chance astride of a
hare. "They are off in a bunch,"
would declare, and at the finish h<
would coolly walk up and cash Ins
tickets, for he won, and won strong.
Then \Y. Kay, of the popular owners,
Kay & Trant, came to the front, first
declaring that he was not connected
with the opposition dog men, and that
no authority had been given them hy
him for his election as an officer in the
new combination, and then followed
with a few well-placed bets. A lady,
well known by many present, persisted
in asking questions, which placed the
baseball female questioner in the
shade.
"Why do tne hares run so fast?" was
her first question, and then when the
gentleman friends had escaped through
a rear entrance she inquired of her
lady companion, "What makes the
hounds follow?" Of course the ques
tions were answered, but the lady rode
home alone.
It was plainly a day for the favorites.
The hares were in splendid trim, and
many courses were more than exciting.
The first throw-down of the day was
when Semlnole, at 2 to 1, lost to the
neglected Sly Boy. Then Eclipse, who
was thought to be a "lead piper," failed
to follow "White Lily. But the faint
ing spells arrived when the ii to 3 fav
orite, Fleetwood, lost to Tod fcloan In
a long and well-fought course. Nelly
B ran a bye with Vigilant, and the
course proved that bettors were not al
ways in the right, as Vigilant took a
nice slice of money, which had been
played at 2*& to 1 against him.
The feature of the day was the run
ning of Diana. Beating such hounds
as Myrtle, Sly Boy and Susie is no easy
thing, and when the fleet hound start
ed the money flooded the ring. Moon
dyne was in bad condition in the fourth
ties. In the course between Moondyne
and White Lily Moondyne won hands
down, but the hare escaped, and un
fortunately a loose rabbit was started,
and a hard run was taken all over the
course. White Lily outran the com
petitor, which proved that Moondyne
was tired from a severe day's work.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 17, 1898.
COULD NOT
IDENTIFY A
SUSPECT
The Robber Who En
tered Jess' Grocery
Is Released.
Confronted by His Three
Victims They Fail to
Recognize Him.
He Is an Ex-Convict, and Is
Well Known by Several
Different Names.
POLICE SURE OF HIS GUILT.
He Recently Served a Short Term
in the San Quentin
Prison.
Since the daring robbery in Jess' gro
! eery store, at First and Folsom streets,
last Thursday night, Detectives Ryan
and ODea have had under suspicion a
â  man whom they strongly suspect of be
ing the robber. He is an ex-convict,
and is known under several different
: names. Convinced that he was the
right man, the detectives yesterday
took him to tho grocery store fur the
purpose of having him identified. Aft
i er carefully scrutinizing him, Jess, the
proprietor, failed to recognize him.
"I was so excited at the time." he
explained to Ryan and O'Dea. "that
even if he was the right man 1 oruld
not identify him."
The two men who were in the store
at the time were then sent for, but,
like Joss, they were unable to i
nize the suspect.
Realizing the folly of throwing him in
jail the detectives, after the three wit
nesses had failed to identify him, re
leased him.
A description of the ex-convict has
furnished the officers of the South
ern Station, With instructions to k>^p
a strict watch on him.
It developed last night that after the
desperate robber entered the saloon he
ordered Jess to turn over to him the
contents of the cash drawer. Only
three dimes were in the drawer, and
Â»vhen the proprietor threw them on the
counter one of them rolled off on the
floor.
The robber placed one of his revolv
er* on The counter and stooped d
to pick up the ten cent piece. One of
the men who was in the saloon at the
time started to reach for the weapon,
when the robber suddenly jumped up,
and, covering him with the other re
volver, threatened to blow out his
brains if he moved another inch. After

LECTURES ON "CIVIL
AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY."
Hon. Charles A. Bonaparte Speaks in a Sen-
sational Style Upon Trusts and the
Acts of Congressmen.
BOSTON, Jan. 16.â Hon. Charles J. Bon
aparte delivered a striking lecture at the
mont Theater this evening on "Civil
and Religious Liberty." attacking trusts
and boodle Congressmen. He said: "It
is a great wrong that the law should be
obscured as it sometimes is. Perhaps
some of our United States Senators would
not be on such familiar terms with trusts
and corporations if a few were hung up
to lamp posts. The progress of the law
is so slow It does not cause any satisfac
tion when its decrees are carried out.
When a man can be convicted, sentenced
and put out of the way in two weeks
after he is caught there will be few
lynrhings heard of.
Mr. Bonaparte alluded to certain secret
societies that had attempted to keep from
public office all men of his faith. He
said be looked with equanimity upon such
efforts. The A. I. A. would help Cath
olics in the opinion of Americans whose
good opinion was worth having. Some
politicians of his faith had lacked Judg
ment and sought to fight the puny ef
forts of the A. P. A. He was very sorry
for it, but those who sought to kindle the
dying fires of religious hatred met with
failure. Time would do the right thing.

ROTTANZI AS
A CRUSADER
Property Owners of the
Mission Flock to His
Standard.
Twenty Picked Men to Urge the
Removal of the City and
County Hospital.
Enthusiastic Meeting nt Maennerbund
Hallâ Strong Speeches Ap
plauded.
The crusade for the removal of the
City and County Hospital to some oth
! er site and the erection of new build
! ings has at last begun in earnest. Yes
terday afternoon the property owners
of the Mission assembled in mass meet
| Ing at Maennerbund Hall, Twenty
fourth street and Potrero avenue, and
used the parliamentary battle-ax vig
orously In a united endeavor to gain
redress of their grievance.
At that meeting two names shone as
stars of the first magnitude of
! Supervisor Rottansl and Senator I*. J.
Dwyer. They have both devoted a
good deal of their time and energy to
the proposed reform, and the assem
blage simply showered them with en
comiums from the drop of the chair
man's gavel to the passing round of the
hat. As a result of that meeting twen
ty representative citizens will call In a
sort of friendly way to interview the
Supervisors on the proposition to-day,
and later on will make a few business
visits. In addition It was decided to
I hold monthly meetings and keep ham
! mering away on the reform string until
! somebody's heart softens or nerves
wearyâ it is the same thing to them.
The meeting was under the auspices
of the Potrero Avenue Improvement
Club. James B. Hughes called it to or
â¢â  der, and Thomas Blevin was selected
as chairman, and Eugene V. Sullivan
as secretary.
After asserting the purpose of the
gathering and the fact that vigorous
support at this time would direct at
tention to Supervisor Rottanzi's pro
posed resolution to remove the hospital
and erect new buildings, Chairman
Slevin read a resolution, adopted unan
imously. Its general purport was as
; follows:
That <"hristian charity r- quires that
community shall care properly
for its Buffering poor; that senator I-.
J. Dwyer had introduced a bill at the
[ as t session of the Legislature empow
.â liiiÃ the Sujurvih^Ts to levy a special
tax of $300,000 for the >. 'instruction of
a new City and County Hospital; that
the hospital was built twenty-five yours
ago with the assurance that it was to
bo torn down and the land to revert to
the city in ten years, none of the prom
ises made at the time being fulfilled;
that the rights of the taxpayers should
be respected in the matter of having a
hospital fit for the largest city west Of
the Rocky Mountains, and that public
decency should be respected and the
suffering poor no longer be treated U
inadequately as th-y have been. The
document concluded as follows:
"Resolved, That the chairman of this
meeting shall appHnt a committee of
twenty, which shall be present at the
next meeting of the Board of Super
visors, to lay before that honorable
body these resolutions, and in the name
of the citizens request that immediate
steps be taken to remedy this crying
and shameful abuse; and. further.
"Resolved. That the secretary of this
meeting be Instructed t<~> present to the
Hoard of Supervisors and to the pr<>ss
of San Francisco a copy of these reso
lutions."
At the suggestion of members of the
audience the following were appointed
a committee to carry out the purpose
of the resolution: M. Ohiandt. t.. j.
Dwyer, T. F. Mitchell, D. F. Keefe, A.
P. M.-ieuire. .Tames P>ehan. James B.
Huches. John Kenney. John Rippe M.
F. C. Mauser. Mr. Newman, P. J. < 'ur
tis. b. Majrlnnla, P. noggins, p. stoi
berg. Rev. William Tuhb. Henry-Schul
ken. M. C. Cull, Max Popper and Will
iam Cook.
This committee was made permanent,
and the first Funday In February was
appointed a? the next time of meeting.
Huphes tried to speak with Dr. Rot
tanzl by telephone, In order to make
arrangements as to the time of confer
ring: â with the board, but failed to find
him.
Stirring addresses were made by Sen
ator Dwyer. A. B. Magulre. Max Pop
per, P. J. Curtis and Rev. Dr. Tubb.
All urged the people to keep working
until their rights were respected. Pop
per struck the keynote of the situation,
erldenced by the applause, when he de
flared that "we want no money ex
pended by the Mission in Caring for
monkeys when human beings are left
sick and neglected." Curtis declared
that the present hospital Is not good
enough in which to place a high-bred
dog. and Rev. Dr. Tubb believed It
would be a fine thing if all the patients
could be removed and the structure
burned to the ground.
Resolutions were adopted tharkinp
Senator L,. J. Dwyer and Dr. Rottanzi
for thf-jr activity in the matter.

THREW UP
HER ARMS
AND DIED
Mysterious Death of
an Old Woman in
the Hospital.
Jennie Webster, While
Chatting With the Sur
geons, Passes Away.
She Was Picked Up by the Po
lice at Eddy and Leaven
worth Streets.
MAY HAVE TAKEN POISON.
Fragments of a Letter Discov
ered in Her Posses
sion.
The surgeons at tho Receiving Hos
pital are puzzled over the death of a
well-dressed woman which occurred in
the female ward last night.
Shortly after 5 o'clock, the woman,
who was about 45 years of. age, was
found lying on the sidewalk at the
corner of Eddy and Leavenworth
streets. The police were notified, and
she was removed to the hospital in the
patrol-wagon. After recovering con
sciousness, the woman said her name
was Jennie Webster. She denied that
she had taken poison, and claimed that
she was subject to fits. She was placed
in the female ward, and at 8 o'clock
lust night she had sufficiently recovered
to ask Dr. Fitzgibbon, who was In
charge, to allow her to go home.
On account of her advanced age, the
surgeon advised her to remain in the
hospital until morning. While chatting
pleasantly with the matron and an at
tache, the unfortunate woman threw
up her hands and suddenly expired.
Her body was afterward sent to the
Morgue.
In a pocket-book which was found
in the bosom of her dress was JL' 20 in
silver and a card bearing the name,
"Miss Clara Fortuna, 319 Sutter street.
There was also found in the pocket
book a portion of a letter bearing the
signature "Miss Ifollle Shaw, Salinas."
Sh>- had evidently destroyed the letter,
tut had carefully preserved the name
Of the sender. The woman was dressed
In a dark brown skirt and a light col
ored waist. She wore a tastefully
trimmed hat and a brown jacket. In
one of her stockings was found a
white handkerchief, in the corner of
which was tied up two $10 gold pieces
an<l two f"> gold pieces.
Officer Gaynor, who took the unfortu
nate woman to the Receiving Hospital,
says that he found her lying on the
sidewalk, apparently unconscious. Sev
eral citizens who were standing by said
that they noticed her walking along
Eddy street. As she reached Leaven
wortfa she suddenly threw up her hands
and fell. Thinking she had fainted
they tried to revive her, but without
avail. It was then that the police were
notified.
The most mysterious feature of the
case is that the woman refused to give
her address.
'"They shall not know of my troubles,"
she remarked to the surgeon, "I would
rather die first."
No amount of questioning could in
duce her to tell where she lived or who
her relatives were. She first gave her
name as Mary Webster, but finally ad
mitted that her true name was Jennie.
Dr. Fitzgibbon is inclined to believe
that the woman's death was caused by
strychnine poisoning. He bases his be
lief on the suddenness of her taking off,
which he thinks could not have been
caused by a fit, as Fhe was conscious
the minute before she died.
At ?.!!> Putter street, the address
found on the card in the â¢woman's pos
session, nothing was known of her, or
of any woman of the name of Clara
For+unji. The clerk looked over his
books to a date months hack and
found no reference to the names in
question.

BUSINESS BEFORE SENTIMENT.
"You old fellows who coil up your line of life here In the city, making the
same old turns day after day until finally the last fathom haÃ been paid in.
pnsH such a routine existence that you have no conception of the sort of life
that we fellows, who pass three-fourths of our time on blue water, eke out,"
said the old sea captain.
"You read of the life of Jack afloat out of books written by men WhOM
sea experience consists of passing over a river on a trestle and imagine you
know all about it. You think that It is all fun and romance, but we old
Bhell-backs, to whom it is a business, are a rather practical lot of old
duffers and look :it things in a different way.
"Point Hope, which lies about 300 miles Inside the Arctic Circle, Is a
place of rendezvous where the whaling fleet put in "tween seasons' to see
each other and have a gam.
"One Sunday morning a few years ago there were about thirty of us
lying there, amongst whom was Cogan, commanding the Bounding Billow.
Cogan bad a man aboard who had been laid up for some time with the
scurvy and who had finally died. As there was no particular business on
hand Cogan decided to bury the fellow in first-class style, and accordingly
Bent Invitations to all the other captains In the whaling fleet to assist at
the funeral. We accordingly went over at the appointed hour and there
found the man neatly sewed up in a piece of canvas with a shot at his feet
all ready to be launched in a seamar.-Uke manner. Cogan came up on deck
dressed for the occasion and carrying a ponderous Bible In his hand. We
all gathered around and stood with uncovered beads while he read the ser
vice for the burial of the dead, and though I am not much given to senti
1 must say that the slc:ht of the outlined human form under the can
vas with a few miserable articles of wearing apparel, representing all that
he had to show for thirty years of hard work before the mast, piled up
alongside it. and we old weather-beaten tarpaulins standing around with
uncovered heads, was a sight to afford food for the reflection of a moralist.
"As the service proceeded the gravity of the occasion seemed to impress
Itself on every one. and as the rough eloquence of Cogan continued the ten
sion became extreme. Just about the time when the captain had reached
the climax of his rhetoric, the mahogany-faced cherub who was up aloft
in the crow's nest sang out "there she blows." The service came to a sud
den stop, Cogan gave one look up to the masthead and another at the
body, and his face was a study as he struggled between professional in
stinct and reverence for the dead. Instinct won the day. 'Heave that
thing overboard and lower away. Twenty dollars to the first boat that gets
an iron in,' he thundered. The corpse was shot Into the water like a bolt
out of a catapult, and a wild scramle ensued for the boats alongside in
which the visitors and those belonging to the vessel alike participated.
About thirty boats' crews took part in the exciting race toward that whale
they followed. Hut though they chased it until far Into the night they never
succeeded in striking it. I guess the dead man must have squared things
by hoodooing their luck."

IDOLATRY IN THE CHURCH-
The Polished Idol of Denorrjloa
tionalism and the Golden
Calf.
"Church Idols" was the theme of Oliver
C. Miller, pastor of the Church of the
Holy Spirit, yesterday at the morning
service.
The speaker selected his text from Ho-
Bea, Jriv:B: "What have I to do any more
with ldolB?" and said in part:
"The chapter from which our text Is
taken records one of the happiest scenes
in the history of Israelâ God returning to
hf-al their backslidlngs and love them
freely because they forsook their idols.
Oh. that this scene might be re-enacted In
our nation. When the church of to-day
le weighed in the balance, it is found
wanting, it requires but a glance to re
veal the fact that she is full of idolatry.
I recently talked with a number of ear
nest ministers of all denominations, and
it was the verdict of all that therf- is
something wrong with the church. What
is it but idolatry? Yes, idolatry. There
stands before us the polished idol of de
nominationailstn set right up in the tern
pie of the living God. Holy Ghost power
is not confined to isms, be they Catholi
cism, Calvinism, Lutheranism or any
other ism. If either Calvin or Luther
could return to the earth to-day, they
would with fiery indignation resent their
names standing lor the pure Gospel of
Christ. Although 1 am a clergyman of
the. Evangelical Lutheran Church, and
am at no variance with its Scriptural
Christocentrlc doctrines, yet will I suffer
Ho denominational walls to come betwe* n
me and my brethren in Christ Jesus, such
as are sealed with the spirit. I can hard
ly believe that denoim nationalism was
ever ordained of God; it is rather the ab
normal than the normal development of
Christian faith and practiced 1 believe
that In these the closing days of the !
Spirit's dispensation be is about to sound j
the death-knell of deiiorninationallsm, i
and elect or call out, from all denomina
tions, those whom be has sealed as heirs
of salvation and who love to watch for '
their Lord's appearing. At Christ's first
coming he broke through al! the existing ;
forms of ecclesiasticism, and so it will be
With his second coming. Oh, for some
Fplrit-filled man, like AÂ«a of old, to cast
out from the Church of the Living God
this polished idol of denominationaiism.
"Then there Is the idol of idealism
Btalking into the very holy of holies of
the church of Christ. .Men fancy their
own Ideals of a perfect life, instead of ac
cepting by faith the only perfect Ideal,
Christ Jesus, the only perfect typal man. j
Then, too, the hideous idol of Self is set
up right around the communion altar of
the Saints. Despite all etYorts to counter
feit the ChrlÃt-Ufe within humanity,
there are really only two kind.s of lives,
the self-centered and the Christocentiic.
Christ is the great supplanter. When he
conr-s in Self must be put out. NotwitTi-
Btandlng God's awful warning to his an
cient people, the Golden Calf is uplifted
in both pulpit and pew, and the majority
of those enrolled in the church fall pros
trate before him in adoration. Here we
find the reason why the church has lost
the respect of and her hold upon the
masses. Among these idols is one most
dangerous, because most popular; the idol
of worldly pride and fashion, flaunting Its
deceptive finery In the very face of God
before whom all Idols must fall. Although
th,Â« time, for the annual revival ia now on,
we need expect no permanent results for
good, unless the people obey Un- cry of
God's prophet unto the house *>f [i
"Thus saith the Lord. Repent, and turn
yourselves from your Idols." It will n^t
do to have a few weeks of revival fervor
and hallelujahs to the Lord, and then go
back to desecrate the house of God with
merchandise and worldly entertainment.
God declares that we must put aw I
these Sduls before he will pour out his
spirit in power and lasting effect upon
his people. The salvation of our nation
depends upon its return to God. who in
myriad voices is crying throuph these
'perilous times.' 'O Israel, return unto
the Lord thy God; for thou hast fallen
by thine iniquity.' Happy our lot could
we hear th* call of mercy, and return,
saying, 'What have I to do any more with
idols?' "
THE BROKEN HEARTED.
The Sermon Preached by Rev. J.
A. B. Wilson Last Nig^t.
At the Howard-Street kfethodlsi Epis
copal Church last nipht the pastor. Rev.
J. A. B.Wilson, preached on "Heart Heal
ing," from Luke. lv:lS: "He hath sent me
to heal the broken-hearted." He said in
part:
The broken-hearted are the subjects of
gospel endeavor. Broken hearts may t>Â»
healed, not helped merely, and for this
very purpose the gospel was sent into the
world. It is a great commission to I
sociated with th^ Savior in this beneficent
mission of healing the broken-hearted.
The fact is. the world is full of broken
hearts. I once thought that people of very
large means were i-xcmjit from such ex
periences, but I have lonp sir
that th> re are no exemptions In this way.
<;â¢"! helps us. Yes. he does help us. f..r
"He hath sent m*Â» to heal the broken
hearted." I know the healer, and can
point every broken-hearted to his al
mighty, all-tender, all-helping power.
JESUITS HONOR
A FEAST DAY
Celebrate Solemn High Mass
in Honor of the Sacred
Name.
Archtolshop Rlordan Delivers a Ser
mon on the Subject of
Christ.
Solemn hiph mass was celebrated at St.
Ignatius' Church yesterday morninj? In
honor of the feast of the Sacred Name of
! Jesus.
His Rraco, Archbishop Riordan, deUv
' ered an eloquent sermon at the m:
j the subject of Christ and his life, touch
j Inp the earliest Institution of the church
| and its remarkable existence to the pres
â¢ day, aftf-r nineteen hundreil yean <>f
j steady growth, since the birth of the
Savior.
"Christ, when he came into the world,
put himself into a three-fold aspect,"
said the preacher, "in the way of the
world, and the way of eternal life."
The speaker then entered a lone dis
cussion on the history of the church from
its foundation to the present time, and
spoke of the imperishable rock it has
stood upon since its creation, outliving
the rise and fall of temporal dynasties
and the birth, growth, and death of vari
ous system of philosophy.
"Of all the systems that man has ever
tried." said the preacher, "not one <;tn
outlive the everlasting system that Christ
has founded and incorporated into his
holy churr-h."
The concluding remarks of the sermon
were devoted to a beautiful tribute t<> tin;
Jesuit priests, the good work they have
accomplished and the assistance they
have rendered to the Archbishop and the
diocese over which he governs.
The mass was celebrated by the Rev.
Father Vossl, he being assisted by the
Rev. Father Buckley as deacon and
Father Carroll as .sub-deacon. Father
Mulligan, from St. Mary's Cathedral,
acted as master of 'â¢â rfmonies; he was
assisted by F.-ither Butler.
The altars were decorated beautifully
with white roses and myriads of wax
candles. Riga's mass was chanted by a
choir of forty male voices, accompanied
by the new organ.

Other Games.
If Photographer Bushnell could have
caught a snap shot of the look of dis
consolatif >n that Temporary Manager
Bob Mitchell wore In the eighth Inning
of yesterday's game, when the Santa
Cruz team were parading the bases and
the players under his chaperonage
were afflicted with such an aggravated
case of rattles that they forgot the
first rudiments of the game, he would
need no more to dabble in the national
sport for the sale of a picture of genial
Hull's countenance would have been a
veritable Klondike.
During the first part of the game
Bob's smile was like a ray of sunshine,
which seemed to overspread the crowd
suffusing it with warmth. Bushneli
had turned over the management of his
team to him for the day, and Bob al-
Lowed himself to indulge in not a few
dreams of returning to his superior
with the glad tidings of vitory. But
when the Santa Cruz team began to
hammer Mr. Moskiman around the lot
the smile gradually disappeared, giving
way to a look of sorrow painful to be
hold.
AJert sympathisers lay the blame of
the team's defeat to auburn-han ed
"Bill" Devereaux, whom they charge
with carrying the remains of his mus
tache In his busi â¢m, and which acted
as a potent influence.
Whatever the cause was, the Alerta
were defeated, and badly at that. Al
though errors were made in plenty the
game was an Interesting one, and was
much enjoyed by the Cans. Both teams
were strengthened for the occasion
with players who have made nam> s in
thi- baseball world. The Alerts played
Lange of Reliance, "Brother Joe" Cor
f the Baltimore! and Iberg of the
California Markets. In the Santa Cruz
ranks were Peoples of th- Olympics,
Stulz and Borland of Reliance and
Doyle of the s.mta Claras.
Santa Crus was the more fortunate
In having men who could bat. ami ow
ing t.i this fact they gained their vic
tory.
I T p to the eighth Inning Iberg pitched
great ball, allowing only seven hits off
his delivery and striking out six men,
thn f them succumbing to his skill
fn one inning. For an unknown rwson
he cave way to M>>skiman In th^ sev
enth, and from that time the Alerts'
chance >\w Indled.
Three runs were all that Santa Cruz
could stack up to the eighth inning.
and twice during tlv game th<Â» AWts
came near evening the score, but luck
was against them.
"Brother Joe" had an excellent
chance to distinguish himself In the
sixth when there -vere three men on
bases, but all he could do was to fan
out.
Borland's heavy battlnpr and
Schmeer's many errors were the only
other noticeable Incidents of the game.

Despite the threatening; weather quite
a crowd of fans went out to the Com
mercial League grounds at Sixteenth and
Folsom streets yesterday and saw the
White House team defeat the Altos.
The game was a little one sided owing
to the heavy batting of the dry-goods
representatives. Keely's work at second
stamped him as being the right man for
that position. The ground was a little

THE X-RAY ON
DURRANT'S LIFE
Rev. W. E. Dugan Draws
Deductions Regarding
His Fate.
He Declares That Appeals Were
Made to the Wrong
Tribunals.
Thinks Christ Was Neglected in Early
Lifeâ a Synonym iop the
Subject.
Theodore Durrant Is dfÂ»adâ ln body.
But In the minds of the preachers he
lives yet, lives as ai; â¢"> â¢ -Hasting ex
ample at which to point the moralizing
finger.
The first thus to draw deductions
that will attract the attention of the
public in any marked degree is the
Rev. E. Dugan, pastor of Stewart
Memorial Church. Guerrero street, near
Twenty-third. The reverend gentle
man not only thought that Durrant's
spiritual nature must have been neg
lected in early life, but believed it so
strongly that the title of his sermon,
"The cry of That Father's Heart tor
His Son," might well have been, "Of
Ali Bad Words of Tongue or lvn, the
lest are These, it Might I
Been." The subject was taken from
John iv:4!Â«.
'The man whom the text treats of."
he said, "was a nobleman holding a
position of wealth and power, but
neither of these had any (harms for the
iron heart of death. The curtains were
drawn, there was a hush in the house,
the child was at the poini "f death, and
in an agony of despair the man went
to Christ with the cry of his heart for
the life of his son.
"When The 'lore Durrant had
1 arrested and tak.-n into the cowl
i this city and that web of circumstance
! had bten drawn tightly around him
which ended in his conviction and fin
ally in his execution â .luring all this
i time that mother's heart was going out
in yearning. In earnest pleading to the
i courts of San Francisco, to the Gov
ernor of our State, to the authorities
at Sacramento, to the authorities at
Washington, and to .-â¢Â»â¢â¢â¢! y one from
: whom there was any h â â â¢ f deliver
ance from the- awful fate that lay be
fore her boy, but she was pouring out
her lamentations and petitions to those
who had no power to gne her back h^r
son.
"Had she with as mucn yarning of
h^art gone to God with that boy in
his teens, the inoid'-nt which has p
a blot on the record of that family,
and has been the noted criminal case
of the century, never would have hap
pened. Jesus Christ Is the only one
who has power to bring deliverance
to those who are troubled. That is
the source to which she should have
gone earlier In his life, before the
of spiritual death and decay had
its Inception."
Th< rest of the pastor's sermon dealt
in generalities. He was listened to
with the closest attention by his au
dience, and at the conclusion of the
service many pr-ssed forward to con
gratulate him < n thÂ» <vay he had
i treated his theme.

To tell the plain, somber truth about
Annie, she is one of the most notorious
pickpockets and one of the worst all

The Plckett woman was for a long time
a pal of the notorious May Bonner, who
was run out of the country by a threat

last victim of this precious pair was an
old man from Tulare County whom they
encountered on Market street, one night
last summer, and enticed into a doorway
on Grant avenue, where they relieved his
pockets, of $206. The visitor soon discov
ered his loss, and. enlisting the aid of
â¢lice, had the women arrested. They

To-Day.
The trial of Theodore Fipel for the mur
der of Isaac Hoffman will come before
Judpe Cook this morning, and it is almost
a certainty that this time the case will
proceed without further delay.
Fipel Is now out on bonds of $100,000, his
sureties being his father. Joseph Figel,
his mother, S. H. Seymour and J. F.
Plummell.
The case will include but little more
than was d*>velopÂ»-,l at the preliminary
hearing, *x<-. pt that the fiefei
a little more latitude in exposing the fam
ily r.'hiti'.ns ..f the Hoffmana in order to
â ut the suicide theory. All such evi
<i.-ncp was ruled out at the preliminary
h< aring, and objections to al! questions
touching upon Hoffman's homo Ufe were
sustained. Flgel hopes the Superior Court
will rul^ differently.
About fort) 9 have been sub
fur the trial - â  far.

OF SENSE
Is Oakland Earnest in
Wanting a New
Charter?
A Review of the Future in
the Light of the
Past.
Tha City, Perhaps, Not So Full of
Cranks as Dr. Knox
Believes.
* Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, Jan. 16.
Do the people of Oakland really want
a new charter? The,re is probably not
to be found within her borders a sin
gle citizen who does not admit the need
of a new organic law for municipal
government, but there is a possibility
that the many scandals connected with
the past few years Jiave created such
marked indifference on the part of the
public generally that they cannot be
persuaded that any charter can restore
decent government, and, corsequently,
the present movement may be defeated
by the very people who are desirous of
a change.
There is good reason for this public
Indifference. City Hall scandals and
quarrels have been so frequent that
they are no longer regarded with any
feeling of shame or significance. They
are accepted as a necessary part of City
Hall politics, which for a long time
have been associated with much that
Is generally regarded as undesirable.
To-morrow evening the Council will
take up the ordinance providing foT the
calling of an election of freeholders to
frame a new charter. As the expenses
of such an election were Included in the
annual tax levy, It Is certain that the
ordinance will finally pass. Important
as the measure is, there has not, up to
this time, been a single manifestation
of public Interest in it, and probably
not one in a hundred of the voters has
any idea that such a measure is before
the city government. As to the need of
It the events of the past are all the
proof that is necessary. Ta-day the
city government is more In politics in
every one of its departments than it
â was in the old time when city employ
ees stood outside the Council chamber
at its weekly meeting wondering
whether they were to be discharged or
retained.
The present charter was one im
provement upon this system, but com
pared with- the prevailing methods of
running the city government at this
time the old Board of Works that was
;t of office three years ago was a
paragon of propriety. It Is surprising
that there has not been more trouble
between the different departments <-f
the city government than there bas
been during the past three years. The
present charter was framed upon the
understanding: that there would be an
Irvir pendant Board of Works, yet, when
the board was abolished by a little
epasm of reform in 1895 and the present
system Instituted, no other changes
â were made, and consequently the city
charter is now an instrument being
carried out by the board, the consti
tution of which was never dreamed of
â when the cnarter was framed.
The citizens will soon be given an
opportunity to have a change, and they
should not be indifferent to it. Dire as
have been the failures of the past, this
is no reason why the present attempt
should prove fruitless. Reform move
ments are all very well when they are
honest; but in this city they are gen
erally born at a time when they are
able to accomplish the least good, and
seÂ«m to go or be driven into hiding
â¢when most needed. At this time a pub
lic movement in favor of a new charter
that shall be an honest charter is cer
tainly the greatest need of Oakland,
and yet not even a primary move has
been made in this direction. At the
same time, any public movement that
1b not based on the broadest principles
of policy had better never be under
taken. There have been in all elements
of society in Oakland too much nar
row-mindedness and selfishness for the
public good and advancement, and a
charter that is not built on principles
entirely different from those that have
prevailed in the past will only add to
the peculiarity of the view h. which
Oakland Is held In other pans of the
country.
Erratic geniuses and theorists never
fail to come forward in great numbers
at a time -when the public good would
be best subserved by heir keeping: in
the background. According to Mrs. Dr.
Knox, chairman of the High School
Board, the Creator may have made
more cranks than are to be found in
Oakland, but ho never placed more of
them In one community. This may be
true, but should this element be per
mitted to control .the formation of a
new charter, Oakland can bid good-by
to progress for the next few year,s.
The great point In city government
that Oakland has had to study and
develop since the town was incorpor
ated in 1852 has been the matter of
dealing with corporations* T obably no
other city of its size has had a larger
experience or a more varied one. There
was a lime when everything connected
with her government was dominated
by a corporation. Little by little the. j
shackles were thrown aside, and It was
learned that there was a common
ground on whirh corporations and mu
nicipalities can come together and
derive mutual benefit. Oakland
learned that corporations, proper
ly governed, are very desirable
adjuncts to a city; but when
permitted to do the governing they are
a city's worst enemies. That stage
having been reached about four yean
ago, it is quite plain to-day that the old
corporation fears the city of Oakland
more than Oakland fears her old
enemy.
No one denies that more capital Is
needed here, and no one conversant
with the state of affairs, now prevail
ing will deny that more has been done
to drive away capital In the past than
to invite it. Any charter that will be
acceptable to conservative citizens
must hear these facts in mind and
must provide for the encouragement of
capital. There are to-day in Oakland
large corporations, whose stocks are at
the lowest because dividends are not
forthcoming. If it should be known in
ALAMEDA COUNTY NEWS.
the money markets of the world that
these stocks, were paying dividends
Oakland would be at once greatly bene
fited. No argument is needed to sus
tain this point. Such measures can be
taken with dignity and self-respect,
but there will no doubt be insinuations
and false motives attributed to all who
say a favorable word for capital. At
the same time there are scores of men
in Oakland who arc able with credit to
themselves and the city to frame a
progressive law that will be in itself
the best refutation of cavil and Jingo
ism, and it is to be hoped that such a
board will be elected.
While one of the Council committees
was in session a few days ago Mr. Up
ton referred to a corporation that is
now attempting to so arrange the street
car systems of this city as to put them
on a paying basis. It is well known
that with all the little Individual lines
running under separate and expensive
managements all were losing money,
and within the past two years they
have gradually entered into a com
bination, which is now under one
powerful management. The consolida
tion is anxious to drop small franchises
and to acquire a few others, for the
purpose of getting things in such shape
that there will ultimately be a hope for
a dividend. Mr. Upton stated that he
believed such investments should be
encouraged, so that others would be
tempted to bring their money here.
Mr. T'pton took a great risk In mak
ing this remark, because of the very
element to which Dr. Myra Knox once
alluded in a public speech. His ideas,
however, are worthy of consideration,
because to admit that such ideas are
an acknowledgment of servility to cor
porations, is to admit the inability of
Oakland to govern herself. Surely even
the most Impracticable theorist has
more confidence In his fellow-citizens
than to declare that no one can bring
a few dollars for investment to this
city and not be required to obey the
ordinances of its government.
In framing the new charter there -will
be no difficulty in procuring brains
enough to formulate a good organic
law, but there will be great difficulty
In preventing the introduction of all
manner of schemes and theories, which
will be advocated by the class In the
giving of which to Oakland the Creator
has been very generous.

The H'Sri School Proposition.
ALAMKDA, Jan. ICâ Quite a strong
1 sentiment is developing- among taxpayers
! against the proposition to erect a high
â¢ i] building. The fact is pointed out
| that the city already has a bonded In
debtedness i, and th" times are
not propitfius for any addition to the
burden thai has to be borne by the tax-
I payers. <"ity Trustee Fletter la very out
spoken in his opposition to the pr<
1 tion. Id s; t ys that the people will never
vote to issue the bond* that would bo

his opinion a new building is not n<
He favors building additions to t v ie
schools already in existence, as the
grounds about most of them are roomy
and such additions can be built at com
paratively small cost ar.d without materi

all.

THE SA"N' FRAXCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JAXrARY 17, 1898.
EXCUSES OF
YOUNG MEN
They Tell Dr. Coyle Why
They Do Not Attend
Church.
Some Reasons Given Are in
Direct Conflict With
Others.
Streetcar Men and Postal Clerk 3 Could
Not Attend If They Ds
eired.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 16.
Rev. R. F. Coyle opened his series of
sermons to-night on the answers he
has received from young men to his
| query sent out recently asking for
j reasons why so few of them attend
| church.
Dr. Coyle said that a goodly number
of replies have been received, all of
them courteous and some of them very
thoughtful and suggestive. All were
not complimentary, but all were hon
est. He said in put:
In Bending out this letter I did not for
a moment assume, as seems to have
been understood by most of those reply
ing, that there are fewer young men
in the churches to-day than in former i
years. a generation or two ago it was
a rare thing to see young people of either
sex enlisted in Christian work or in any
way prominent in church life and activ
ity, and especially young men. But it is ,
not bo now. The truth is that the num
ber of young men who go to church has
been steadily Increasing, and Is larger on
this Sabbath day than ever before. In
calling attention to this subject I am
not to be considered as implying that
church neglect among young men is
growing, for that does not agree with
the facts.
One reason assigned for their absence
from church, and It Is common to all
the answers I have received, Is "indifier
enco, "lack of- religious feeling." One
young man says, "\S"e do not feel the
compulsion to attend." This indifference '
is variously explained. Two or three of j
my correspondents say: "Too much
church In early life. "we had to go I
whether we liked it or not. It made us !
Bore and sour, and now we do not care
to go."
In direct opposition to this, others say:
we were not required to go to church
when we were younger; we were per- I
mitted to grow up without the church
and >so never formed the habit of attend
ing."
Thus, on one side they got too much
church; on the other they did not get
enough; hence their indifference.
The need of recreation i.-> another rea
son given for absence from church, and
it is dwelt upon in every letter. One
writer tells me that he often hears the
following offered as an excuse for non
attendance: "I work hard all the week
and need the fresh air and recreation
which green field's church alone can give.
My boss is a churchman, and if he is
interested In my welfare why doesn't he
and the rest close thejr Etores Saturday
afternoon and give us a chance, to go to
church." The writer concludes this speci
fication by saying: "There is much in it,
but still 1 believe it covers a multitude
of sins." In which judgment I think he
is about right. â  r*
Several of my correspondents declare
that hundreds of young men are kept
from church. JÂ»y Sunday labor, and that
we know is true. The street-car men
say: '-it is Impossible for us to attend
church. We have to wait on Christian
people and see that they get to their
places of worship." *%
One young man writes "The postofh"t"T
men say that three-quarters of tho mall
I delivered from the windows on Sunday is
received by people Just from church, and
j that if the good people would stay away
| Uncle Sam might be induced, from lack
j of patronage, to close up all day and
1 give his boys an opportunity to attend
j church."
Ji is difficult to say anything in reply
as these. Tl â 
casm that pricks up through them is de
served.
on ore side the preaching is found
fault with because it is too doctrinal, and
on th(
1 am
tly willing to admit that th<
thing in both charges. 1 nai
doubt that we i>re;i times deal
With things a little I â¢â  from life,
and sometimes we try to ret so close

A VERY UNIQUE
PROPOSITION
The Rev. Edwards Davis
Wants a Religious
Debate.
Asks Rev. Father YorkÂ© to Go
Over the State With
Him.
A Controversial Leotura Tour as a
Means of Obtaining Money and
Advertisement.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
903 Broadway, Jan. 16.
A good deal of surprise has been
manifested at an original proposition
made a few days ago to Rev. Father
Yorke by Rev. Edwards Davis ! of
Oakland. The idea advanced by the
Oakland divine embraced a tour that
would be distinguished by controversial
lectures in all the leading cities of the
State. There does not seem to be much
prospect, however, of the people of Cal
ifornia being regaled with any such In
teresting spectacle.
Neither of the gentlemen Is anxious
to talk of the proposition, but it oc
curred nearly two weeks ago. Rev.
Mr. Davis called upon the well-known
defender of the Catholic faith at the
office of the Monitor and outlined his
proposition. According to what has
drifted out of the sanctum regarding
the interview Father Yorke was advis
ed of the fact that he was well known
as a champion of Catholic rights, and
was popular, and Mr. Davis also stat
ed that he was not altogether unknown
to the people of California.
Newspaper work and routine preach
ing not being particularly productive at
this time, it was suggested, so it is
said, that for the two to tour the State
with a lecture repertoire might prove
a very acceptable proposition from a
financial point of view, as well as add-
Ing to the laurels the two gentlemen
have already -won In their respective
spheres.
Rev. Father Yorke listened to Mr.
Davis' plans, and Is said to have stated
later that it was the first time in his
life that he had been at a loss for an
answer. The proposition took the edl
tor-prieÃt so completely by surprise and
was so far remcrved from any plan ever
contemplated by him that he was ab
solutely nonplussed.
He listened courteously to all that the
visitor had to say, and the result of the
interview was that the matter was held
In abeyance subject to what might be
agreed upon when Mr. Davis should
call again. Mr. Davis has not yet call
ed again.
"I called on Father Yorke," said Mr.
Davis, "and outlined a plan to him em
bracing a lecture tour thro-ugh the
State. He received me very courteous
ly, but we came to no agreement. I
would prefer, however, that he express
!iis views of the project in the press
before I say anything. When he ha?
expressed himself I will give my
vk-v.s."
B 'NE B 'RITH.
There Is prÂ»at activity In the order at this
time, preparing for the twenty-flfth annual
session of the District Grand Lodge, which 19

There will be at least 135 representatives In
the grand body, and the Oregon district will
make an unusually fine showing.
It Is expected that the representatives of
the grand lodge will take part in the jubilee
procession.
During the Eesslon of - the rrand body the
business that will occupy the greatest atten
tion will be the report that is to be presented,

NOTES FOR THE
NATIONAL GUARD
Some of the Appointments
on the Division Staff
Are Not Popular.
Candidates for Governor Will
Be Questioned on Military
Affairs.
T*o Full-Dress Uniforms for tho
Jubilee Paradeâ A Model of
the Marion.
Much of the time of the National j
Guardsmen In this city was taken up !
last week in making preparations for the
grand jubilee day parade, consequently
there was hut little of general interest
going on in guard circles.
Colonel H. B. Bush, whilom assistant
adjutant-general on the division st;iflf, has
turned over the offia el Thomas
duff, his successor, and every day at
noon the new adjutant is to be found at
quarters in the Baldwin Hotel. Dur
ing his absence the office is in charge of
Major Schmitt, a medical student at the
University of California, who was pro
moted from a non-commissioned â 
in the Lowell High School Cadets to
that of aid on the division staff, with the
title of major. While it is true that
Major Schmitt is an active, bright, well
educated young man, who, no doubt, is
very ambitions, there are many of those
who have business to transact at head
quarters who are of the opinionâ and
they have not been res* rved in their
expressions thereof â that positions
of that character should be given to
men who have had practical â 
in the guard and who are soldiers â men
who by hard work have acquired a
knowledge that cannot be pained by
theoretical instruction.
As the time for the gubernatorial elec
tion is approaching and candidate
the offifp of Governor, who is comma
in-chief of the National G loom
ing up. they will in the near future find
that there is a force quietly at work in
the ranks of the guard. It Is pr<
to test those who will be candidate
the office of Governor on National Guard
matters, and one matter that they will
be particularly questioned about will be
their position "in the matter of taking the
office of adjutant genera] of the State out
of politics. The nif-n say they are get
ting tired of having a new adjutant gen
eral once every four years, and th:: :
an officer should be i | Luring gi.od
behavior and only retln d for cause or for
age. ;
There is considerable complaint about ;
the rule that prohibits State shoots on j
Sunday. The men who belong to the Na- j i
tional Guard are willing to face the tar- '
gets, but as the majority of them are em- j
ployed in business from which they can
not get away without a. great deal of in- â¢
convenience during the week, the result 1
Is that there is but a very small percent
age of the men who attempt to become
marksmen. Previous to the new order
they could, on their day off. get to the ! ,
targets without inconvenience and make
records.
The companies of the First Infantry I
will shoot between the following dates,
January 22 and 29, not including Sunday,
the 23d. As they have .not yet secured
their range near 'ingleside they will have ;
to go across the bay.
As yet the companies of the Fifth Reg
iment of Infantry have not received any
Instructions in regard to the January
shoot.
Lieutenant T. W. Sparrow of G. First
Infantry, Major J. H. Hendy, engineer of
ficer of the Second Brigade, and Captain
W. D. Elliott of D. Fifth Infantry, have
passed the examining Board.
Colonel Thomas duff, assistant adju
tant general; Lieutenant-Colonel J. A.
Huber, commissary; Lieutenant-Colonel
Barrere, inspector of rifle practice; Lieu
tenant-Colonel Henry F. Emeric, pay- j
master; Lieutenant-Colonel C. T. Stanley,
quartermaster, and Major J. G. Fitzger
ald, chief aide, recent additions to the <ii- i
vision staff, passed the examining board
on Friday last.
The entertainment proposed for the
benefit of the rifle range fund of the First
Regiment of Infantry will not be given
until after the close of Lent.
The Board of Officers of the First Regi
ment of Infantry has selected the several
committees for the year and following are
the chairmen thereof: Finance. Major
Charles Boxton; music, Captain A. J.
Kelleher; library. Captain John A. Miller.
At the first business meeting of Com
. panics C and G. First Infantry, at the
Ellis-street Armory, in the presence of a :
full attendance of both companies, the j
following civil officers were elected for
the current year: C. P. Lebreton, treas
urer; J. S. Macabe, financial secretary;
G. T. Phelps, recording secretary; T. Me
. Gilvery. librarian: J. F. Morton, A. E.
Anderson and J. P. Heilbron, range com
mittee; G. J. Petty, W. F. and C. W.
Swasey, armory committee; and S. 11. '
Palmer, C. Meyer and O. C. Baldwin,
auditing committee. Last Monday these
companies had the annual distribution of
medals and prizes for shooting, after
which there was. as usual, a National's
good time. The medal winners are: -
Championship class, C. Meyer, Company
C; first class, Sergeant F. J. Porey, Com- i
pany G; second class, V. F. Northrup,
Company C; third class, Sergeant J. H.
McKnight, Company C. The prizes that .
were distributed to the next best shots
numbered about seventy-five.
The election for a captain to succeed
Charles A. Jenks as commander of Troop
A will probably be held this week.
The idea that the First Regiment In
fantry should on jubilee day parade ap
pear in full dress uniform has been aban- i
doned, and the men will appear in fa- I
tigue dress, and this came about because !
some of the sections of the Second Bri
gade have not full-dress uniforms. Twelve
companies could have made a very fine
showing, but because two or three com
panies of the brigade did not have full
dress uniforms the citizens will be de
prived of the opportunity of seeing how
the First looks in full <lre?s. This is an
other case of the tail wagging the dog,
or of a minority ruling the majority.
Nevertheless, the three majors of the
First, or, rather, two majors and one
acting such, for Major Charles L. Tilden
has been on the sick list -and has not done
any active duty for many months, will
this week inspect the full-dress uniforms
of the several companies.
THE NAVAL MILITIA.
The work of removing all the movables
from the Camanche to the Marion has
been accomplished and there remains in
the monitor but six tons of coal, which
could not be placed in the bunkers of
the Marion for want of room. It is prob
able that this will have to be sacked and
placed on the deck of the vessel. When
that shall have been done, the militia's
new vessel will be all ready to be taken
to this port. The day has not yet been
fixed and it will be at the pleasure of
Governor Budd, who desires that the
event shall be a grand one in the history
of the militia. She will be steamed down
from the island under the orders of Cap
tain L. H. Turner.
Bruno Nellson, one of three men de
tailed by the Navy Department for duty
on the Camanche. but who will, with
-three more, be assigned to the Marion,
about two weeks ago received a block
Df pine and out of that he carved a fine
model of the Marion and then rigged her"
Dut completely. So complete is the model
that on last Tuesday Lieutenant Gunn
used it for the purpose of Illustrating a
lecture on sailing, and by its use made
Clear many things that the officers of the
militia will have to know when they go
on board of the Marion.

United States, a large relative share
will fall to this New Northwest: for it
Is yet in its infancy of development. In
1890 the total acreage of Minnesota
farms, improved and unimproved, was
18.603,654. leaving at least 2
rtile soil still unoccupied. The
farms of the two Dakotas, including
their unimproved acreage, cml
oniy 19,000,000 of the 90,000.000 acres in
these States, most of which is arable. .
Not a tithe of th<> mineral wealth of the
mountain States has been developed.
Alaska, reached by numerous steam
ship lines from Seattle, Taooma and
and, with its boundless wealth of
auriferous rivers and mountains, is an
outpost of this Northwest belt. Large
areas of fertile but arid land in Mon-
Washington and Northwestern
Dakota, now xiseful only as pastures
for cattle and sheep, may easily be'
converted into fruitful fields by a scien
tific system of irrigation, for which na

mountain streams and in the artesian
basins which underlie the Dakota
plains. The areas adapted t<> agricul

THE BELT OF SPRING WHEAT.
The spring wheat nf the Northwest
owes its superior nutritious qualities t->
a law which governs the whole p;
Bion of commercial flora, of which it is
the leading representative â that the
cultivated plants reach their highest
perfection in food qualities near the
northernmost limits of their growthâ a
law to which the bright summer sun.
the clear dry atmosphere, arid th>- pure
waters of this Inland region lend ad
ditional force. The cattle which bo
come skeletons on the plains of T
are driven north to grow fat on the
grasses of the Montana and Dakota
ranges, or the pastures of Minnesota,
twice as rich in albuminoids as even
those of Illinois. The fruits of these
northern latitudes are juicier, the pota
toes more farinaceous, the melons more
luscious. The strawberries, the toma
toes, the butter, the whole series of
field, garden and dairy products, tell
the same story. This hard wheat belt,
following the curves of mean summer
temperature, extends far north of the
international boundary, through Mani
toba and the Canadian Northwest, tra
versed by the Canadian Pacific and
tapped by several American lines.
Within the United States it embraces
the broad prairies of Minnesota and the
two Dakotas.â From "The New North

Magazine.
A MIGHTY WORK.
"The great wall of China which. -we
have heard of from infancy, and which
we read of in our geographies, with ac
companying pictures purporting to
represent its great proportions, never
ceases to interest the people," said Mr.
Prank A. McClellan of Cheyenne. Wyo.,
last night at the Riggs. "it was a great
piece of work on the part of the Mon
golians, and must be ?ee n t<> bo ap
preciated. With all that we have heard
of the wall, it remained for an Ameri
can to measure the structure. This was
recÂ« ntly done by a gentleman from the
United States named I'nthank. an en
sslon. His measurement
gives the height at eighteen feet. Every
few hundred yards there is a tower
twenty-five feet high. For 1200 miles
the waH goes over plains and moun
tains, every foot of the foundation be
ing of solid granite, and the rest of the
structure solid masonry."â Washington

EDWIN BOOTH AS A HUSBAND.
At this period the second Mrs. Booth,
always a nervous invalid, began to
show pigns of the mental lack of bal
ance which finally sapped her own life
and almost broke his heart. During
her frequent attacks at Sarato â â  and
later, when the two families met in
New York and in Loi.don, sometimes
she was very trying, but I never knew
him to show a sign or utter a word
of impatience. He bore meekly with
everything she said and did, made ex
cuses for he.-, concealed Ler irritability
and her Irresponsibility as much as
possible; he held her in his arms, as if
she were ;â  baby, for hours and nights

STOLE HIS FARE.
An Irishman landed in Liverpool
when the cholera was bad and went to
an undertaker for a job.
The man of the somber business said
'ild give him two days' work, and
the first job would be to screw a Jew
down.
Before the operation began all the
relatives walked round the coffin and
dropped money in.
When l'i.t got back to the shop h<^
asked his master what they dropped
the money in for, and the master
it was to pay the dead man's fare
over the Jordan.
"Then," said Pat, "I hope he can
swim, for I stole his fare"

up to the average.
The light on the targets was not
such as to insure pood scores, for the
fog hung over the park during the af
ternoon, when the shooting was most
spirited, and, added to this. It was cold
and correspondingly damp. The air
was still, and the si;:. ike -from the
ri:!<-s of the marksmen hung over the
butts. Despite the unfavorable con
ditions there was plenty of shooting.

OFF DAY FOR MARKSMEN.
Ambitious Sharpshooters Shiv
ering at the Ranges of
Shell Mound.
Yesterday was an "off day" at the
Shell Mound targets.
It was such according to the regular
schedule of the clubs using the ranges
and by reason of the fact that the fore
boding weather kept some of the marks
men away and the cold bestowed upon
the fingers of those who did essay an
onslaught on the bullseyes a numbness
which rendered a steady aim well nigh
Impossible.
It was mostly :i matter of practice
and medal shooting by ihe military, and
some of the companies which had tar
pets fur the day did not appear to claim
them.
The San Francisco Schuetz^n Y<-rc-in
held Its monthly practice shoot, with â 
fair attendance, as did also the Knights
of the Bed Branch Rifle;-.
Companies A and V, of the Fifth Regi
ment, held a practice shoot at 20
ami i>Ct yards. Their shooting rules have
not yet been agreed upon, hut they will
soon commence the regular medal com

PILING UP DEBT.
The all-important question during the
Reichstag session just begun is the re
organization of the German navy on a
much enlarged basis. . The Emperor,
whose hobby the navy Is. as his grand
father's was the army, just now wishes
to increase the size of the German fleet
within the next seven years until it is
one-third that of the British or one
half that of the French. At present
the British navy has 62 battleships and
l â¢. cruisers; that of France 36 battle
ships and Â£3 cruisers. Germany is to
have 19 battleships and 63 cruisers.
Nearly, if not quite, all that the Reich
stag is willing to grant, but what the
majority of the delegates are not will
ing to grant is the "septennate"; that
is. to vote with the Government on the
whole financial plan on which this reor
ganization rests. At this moment the
German navy consists of but 12 battle
ships and 33 cruisers (against the
United States, 11 and 47, respectively,
or Japan's 7 and 39). and that this is
not enough is admitted pretty nearly
all around, considering the transmarine
colonies and the aspirations of Ger
many and her vast export trade. But
the Reichstag strongly dislikes tying
its successorâ for the quinquennial leg
islative period of this present Reichstag
ends next spring, and a new <>r.e is then
to be elected for another five yearsâ
to a line of action over which this suc
cessor has no control. â¢ That, in fart, is
the main objection to the naval plan of
the Government, and owing to it prob
ably the whole plan will fail, for the
present at least. However, there Is a
strong probability that the first annual
appropriation called for under the bill
will '"â¢ voted,! and that ought to satis
fy them for the nonce, leaving the rest
to the next Reichstag.
How enormously the empire's debt
has grown- nearly every penny of
It for the army and navyâ may be seen
from the following list. The debt was:

There is no riddle about it. The Ger

WHAT CAUSES STEAM?
A newsboy at one of our railway
stations was very much puzzled as to
what made the steam issued from the
railway oi:nines.
Beeing a learned-looking old gentle
man pacing up and down the platform,
he accosted him thus:
"I say. mister, will you tell me what
steam is."
"St tarn, my boyâ steam, did you say?
Oh â er, Bteam is steam, of course."
The lad felt as wise as ever after
receiving this reply, and seeing a mate
of his coming toward him, he addressed
him with
"Bill, do you know what steam is?"
"Why, of course I do. Jack. It's a
bucket of water all of a sweat," he
replied, with ;t knowing air.
HE WANTED TO KNOW.
A North of Scotland clergy man al

they ought t<> whistle.
One Sunday he preached a sermon
on the loaves and the fishes, and be
ing at a loss how to explain it said the
loaves v.- re not like those nowadays,
they were as big as some of the hills
of Scotland.
He had just pronounced these words
when he heard a loud whistle.
"\Vha\s that ca"s me a liar?" asked
he.
'It is I. Wullie Macdonald, the

General Miles Wants Commissioned
and Non-dommiasioned Officers
to Be Emblematized.
The transfer of the batteries of heavy
artillery of the Third Regiment from one
post to another In this district, was ac
complished last Wednesday and Thurs
day without any marked incident and the
change has not brought about any noitce
able effect, yet there are a number of the
men who were loth to vacate the pleasant
quarters at the Presidio to take up new
ones on islands distant from the city.
It has been decided that the grand par
ade df troops shall take place on the large
parade grounds on the afternoon of the
28th inst.
Since last Monday a detachment of a
non-commissioned officer and six men
from each battery at Fort Mason. Fort
Baker and Angel Island, in addition to
the artillerymen stationed at the Presidio,
have been engaged on the Fort Point res
ervation in the work of mounting the
heavy guns and -mortar carriages. Of the
latter there are to be eighteen. The work
is to be completed before the end of June.
All the men who are to take part in the
military tournament to be given during
jubilee week, have been busy practicing,
when not in the performance of military
duties, and in this they have been en
couraged by the officers, who are anxious
that the participants shall make a cred
ttable showing at that time.
Commencing to-day. First Lieutenant
Eugen. T. Wilson, Third Artillery, will
report daily, Sundays excepted, to the
commanding officer at the Presidio post
in connection with the mounting of gun
carriages at that post.

no black fit after\vards. There is. too,
something very pleasant about all the

smell of the fresh crisp shavings, the
lovely gloss that follows a sharp plane
over a good bit of cypress or oak.
even the ring of the hammer and the
drone of the saw eating steadily

MUST THE
MEN PAY
HER COURT?
Rumor Hints What a
Beau Must Do to
Keep Afloat.
Some New Developments
in the Salisbury-Wells
Case.
Gossip Has a Merry Time
Apropos -of the Latest
Scandal
WHO BOUGHT A BELLEDOM?
A Pair of Sleiprhbells Lost and â 
Pair of Sleighbells
Found.
And still the merry social war con
tinues the tumultuous tenor of its way.
leaving no gory trail to mark a course
strewn with spicy hits of gossip, point
ers for the uninitiated, authenticated
tales from the "Inside" and pointed
aphorisms born of the occasion and the
hour.
Mr. Wells 'Imps not into poetry, hut
sententious phrases and says: "He
-who runs society for his own personal
benefit, who consider? BOCiety an asset
purely personal with him, makes a big
mistake."
Mrs. Salisbury, the leading lady in
this social farce, evidently considers
her role- a strong thinking part, for she
pays nothing at all. maintaining the
same dignity that has always hereto
fore characterized her, and treating the
entire tale <>f commercial belledom with
highbred silent contempt.
Dame Gossip naturally has taken a
hand in the game and drawn the beau
as well as the belle into the conflict.
With a more than usual justice she ac
credits the "full grown man" with some
backbone, but unmercifully grills the
I . harmless, necessary dancing
brownie.
Says the worthy unreliable dame:
"i/trs. Salisbury insists that all her
men â the men who lead and dance at
her cotillons, pay court to her. She
is at home on Sundays and there they
are aU expected to call. A big proces
sion of men is imposing'; it looks as if
her daughters were admired to within
an inch of their lives. Woe betide the
poor little dancer who fails to make
his wt-ekly call. Arui they go. Every
one of them. Have to. They are ac
tually afraid not to.
"With the full grown men it is quite
different. They belong to â  the Fort
nightly for Ihe very same reason that
the brownie pays his weekly duty call
but they draw the line at paying court
to the Czarina.
"Further."' says interesting but un
trustworthy gossip, "motherless belles
were a great source of revenue. Doting
fathers with plethoric purses readily
saw the necessity of a reliable social
guide of unquestioned Hrth and breed
ing, and they paid handsomely for the
same." We could, if we would, but
either they can't <>r they won't, for
they stop provokingly short right in the
most exciting part.
Then there is a story of sleighbells.
mixed up in it. although to the un
initiated it is not (juite clear what
pleiphbells have to do with dancing
S. But the tale comes from Mr.
Greenway and some how or other it
does not seem quite proper to have a
social story in which Mr. Greenway's
name does not appear. Thus runs the
fable â it must be a fable, for it is sup
posed to have a moral:
Once upon a time Mr. Greenway, at
a gr<=at personal expense, imported from
Baltimore, the worthy home of the suc
ulent bivalve, a pair of sleigh bells.
These same Imported beils were used
at a Christmas cotillon and then, like
the Jewels of a farewell tour diva, were
reported missing. Sleuths were put
upon the track, but the bells left no
telltale tinkle behind them. Time sped
on and Mr. Herrin gave a cotillon.
Handsome Kate Salisbury led and one
of the most taking features was the
Fleighbell figure. The refit of the fable
Is wrapt in mystery, and the moral
hard to df^corn. However It concludes
â with a vulcrar refrain: "Where did you
get those sk-ighbflls?"
And while the unconcerned are enjoy
ing themselves so thoroughly Mr.
Wells, who unintentionally let loose the
dogs of war, Is overwhelmed with a
great pity for the unfortunate organizer
Of the Fortnightly.
"Phe 1p a good mother," he says. "Re
cently her actions have been peculiar,
hut I fear she is not responsible for
â¢what she pays or does."

during the week. The band will be as
signed to lead the California State Min

Colonel James F. Smith, chief of
Grand Marshal Morse's staff, was en
gaged all day yesterday in preparing
the details of the parade. He estimates
that at least 16.000 or 17,000 men will
be in line, which will make the dem
onstration one of the greatest ever held
In this city.
The parade committee has extended
an invitation to Brigadier General Mul
ler. commanding the Third Brigade,
with headquarters at Fresno, asking
him and his staff to command the pa
rade. In addition to this command, it
is probable that the companies, com
prising the Fifth Infantry Regiment, N\

Xiipa, Oakland and Alameda,' will also
participate.
Work on the floats ordered by the
Jubilee committee is progressing favor
ably. They have been inspected daily

satisfied that the eras they are intend
ed to commemorate will receive a fit

CELEBRATED HIS FIRST MASS
Hundreds of people eager to attend the first mass of the Rev. T. J
O'Connell, the young priest who was ordained last Friday at St Mary's
Cathedral, were turned away from the door of old St Mary's Church nn
California street yesterday morning, unable to gain entrance Into the build
ing:. Those who were fortunate enough to come early procured seats In
the galleries and downstairs wherever there was an unrserved or empty
seat, and when these were a;i taken Urn surging crowd forced Its way down
the aisles almost to the steps leading to the sanctuary.
Just before the ceremony of mass began It whs found nnrossnry to turn
the people away by force, and one of the Paullst pr Isted by a
number of police officers, vainly endeavored to persuade 'thÂ« -people who
were trying to force their way Into the center aisle thai there was no
more accommodation, and that it would h<- better to attend mass at one
of the near-by churches. This they refused to do, and the priest compelled
them to accept the alternative, and forced tho crowds from the main vesti
bule, shutting and bolting the doors of the church. Those in the church
prop< r were allowed to remain.
During mass Father D'ConneD was assisted by the Rev J F Rvrne
who acted as deacon to the new priest, Father J. P. MeQuade as sub-dea
con, and the Rev. John C. Oottle as master of ceremonies. Father M. Con
nelly performed the office of assistant priest,
The Rev. Peter C. York.- delivered an eloquent sermon on the subject
of "The Priesthood of To-day,"' tracing Its growth from Its Institution
down to the present generation, and upholding the noble sacrifice of its
members in consecrating their lives to Almighty Ood and performing Ills
holy mission by preaching His word and spreading His gospel from one end
of th<' earth to Its opposite confines.
He traced the priest of to-day bark to the night before Christ laid down
his life to wash away the curse of mankind, when the Saviour of the
world, surrounded by his Apostles, preached his mission before them In
structing them to go forth in the world and preach His word to. all man
kind.
In conclusion he paid a touching tribute to the noble career of Father
O'Connell, telling of the time when in early boyhood he knelt at the same
altar and beneath the same cross where he now stood to offer up his first
mass and consecrate his life to the glory and honor of God.
Specially for the occasion and in honor of the young priest's first mass
the l'anlist fathers made every effort to make it a m.-morahle event in his
life Haydn's glorious war mass was arranged and sung by a specially aug
mented choir of thirty voice*,
In addition to the organ, the singing was accompanied by Instrumental
music. The services of Eugene B. Sc-hmltz. the music v director of the
Columbia TSeater, and an accomplished violinist,- were procured for the
occasion, as were also a number of other musicians.
The altars were beautifully decorated with ferns and bouquets of rare
and beautiful flowers furnished by members of the Ladies' Aid Society, and
expressly for the occasion.
At the conclusion of the mass the young priest, after repairing to the
sacristy and divesting himself of his vestments, returned to the sanctuary
and offered up his blessing to God for the hundreds who knelt to receive It.
Among the notable priests who attended vesterday'a mass were the Rev.
Fathers Riordan and Shallo of th<> Banta Clara College.

"fllmflammed" out of $5 by two well
dressed men last Friday afternoon.
Mrs. Becker was alone in the store
when the sharpers entered. They pur
chased 10 cents' worth of candy, claim
ing that it was for a sick boy, who
lived in the neighborhood. They ten
dered her a $10 gold piece, and as she
handed them a $5 gold piece and the
balance of the change in silver they
asked her if she could not give them
all silver. She readily did so, and,
placing the $n gold piece in the cash
drawer, start* d to enter the rear room.
One of the sharpers called her back,
and after remarking that he did not
want to carry so much silver asked her
to let him have the gold piece. The
woman gave him the money, but in the
excitement forgot to ask him for its
equivalent in silver. It was not until
the sharpers had gone some time that
the innocent woman realized that she
had been robbed of V\ She at once
communicated the facts to the police,
and two detectives were Pent to make
an Investigation. From the description
given of the men the police are con
vinced that they are the individuals

Police officer McXamara of Captain
SpillaiK-'s division late Saturday night
arrested a man who gave his name as
William McDowell o n suspicion of hav
ing stolen a lady's gold watch and
chain and a valuable ring which was
found in his possession. He and a com
panion. wh(r was not arrested were
n Market street trying to dispose
of the jewelry to passersby.
McNamara's attention was called to
them, and convinced that they had
stolen the jewelry, he decided to arrest
them. As h<> approached the pair they
ited. one running down Market
street and the other in a westerly di
rection. McNamara followed the man
who had tried to sell the jewelry, and
after a short chase overtook him He
was then taken to the City Prison and
his name registered on the "small
book."
Yesterday the case was turned over
to Detective Dillon, who is anxiously
striving to find an owner for the prop

DISCOURSE BY DR. MYERS.
Subject, "Is Judaisro a F^ltcfyer)
Rellgioo?" Well Han
dled.
An entertaining discourse was delivered
last evening by Rahbi Isadore Myers at
the Bueh-street Temple, Congregation
Ohabai Shalomo. His subject was, "Is
Judaism a Kitchen Religion?"
The reverend doctor said that while the
JÂ» -ws were for years forced to live under
great disadvantages and in crowded
places, vital statistics show that they are
more vigorous and live longer than their
Gentile friends. One of the causes of this
condition of things Is to be found in the
Mosaic dietary laws, the observance of
which is most conducive to good health
and longevity.
The Jew was always anxious to know
what he was eating, and only ate what
he could properly assimilate. The Jewish
boily has always been considered sacred
as a j.art of his religion, and especially
was he solicitous that anything con
taminting should be avoided. That was
why the Jew was careful of the char
acter of the animal food of which he par
took. While some people regarded clean
liness as next to godliness, the Jew
looked upon it as part and parcel of god
liness.
The Jews have less deaths than births,
and have been exempt from epidemic
diseases on account of their hygienic
laws, the wisdom of which has been ad
mitted by modern scientific men. It Is
a well-known fact that the flesh of ani
mals is the greatest conductor of disease
perms, and that is why the Jew requires
that the expert who kills the beast must
first make sure that it is perfectly
healthy, and even the knife used must
contain no notch nor blemish. The Eng
lish and American governments have
adopted the Jewish method of Inspecting
meat, and long before there was any
Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Ani
mals the Jews were humane in their
treatment of dumb beasts.
Rabbi Myers referred to the renowned
actresses. Rachel and Sarah Bernhardt,
two daughters of Israel, who though
comparatively frail evinced extra
ordinary vigor on the stage. He exhorted
his hearers to educate their neighbors up
to the highest standard of pure living,
which can only be found in the sanitary
laws of the Jewish religion.
A LATTER-DAY DIOGENES.
Rev. J. George Gibson Thinks Mer)
Are Fjord to Find It} This Age.
Pioprr.cs and Rev. J. Georffe Gibson of
Baptist Emmanuel Church are ;i unit on
one propositionâ that the number of men
on earth are few. The reverend pentle
man took for his theme last evening "Let
Him First Cast a Stone nt Her." John
v1i1.7. Before the sermon he sang a bary
tone solo, "I Am the Door."
"A woman asked me the other day," he
said, "if I knew I was being watched to
see what message I was going to give the
young. Well, I want to say right here
that most of the discords of the ages
have not been rang hy the young. The
aged have contributed their nut.' to the
lack of harmony."'
He asked that no criticism be made of
the subject he had selected until he had
finished speaking. He believed that one
who had labored in the slums of London
was competent to speak on that theme
"The New Testament story has often
been referred to as one of woman's deg
radation," he asserted, "but to mv mind
It is an example of man's. But women
are always to be condemned, and men
never. Why? Simply because men are
too few in mi mi
The subject ended with an admonition
to his hearers to be careful in criticizing
others, for, like the gospel story, it ma?
be thought. -to an exposition of the
unworth of the critic.
