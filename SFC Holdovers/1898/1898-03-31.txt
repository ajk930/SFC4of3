SAGASTA APPRECIATES
THE CONDITION THAT
NOW CONFRONTS SPAIN
It Is in the Disinclination of the Ministry to Put Its
Concessions in Distinct Terms That
the. Greatest Danger Lies.
MADRID, March. 30.â While the
situation here is outwardly of the
calmest description, the actual posi
tion of affairs is regarded as critical
by both the United States Legation
and the Spanish Government.
The United States Minister, Gen
eral Stewart Woodford, is working
energetically and will continue to
â work energetically for peace until the
first gun is fired. It is known that
the Spanish Government admits the
desirability of 'complying with the
demands of the United States and it
was only in the disinclination of the
.ministers to put this willingness in
concrete form that the danger lies.
If a conference were to be held with
British, German or French diplomats
the matter would be settled without
question.
The point -which General Woodford
is now pressing is that in the inter
est of humanity, hostilities in Cuba
must cease immediately. No date was
fixed either in the first or in the pres
ent note, but the United States is
now dwelling upon the meaning of
the word "immediately" and insist
ing that Spain accept its general in
terpretation. The public generally is
taking little apparent interest in the
situation, but there is a general dis
inclination to believe that war is.

that the armed steam yacht Giralda.

ment from Harry McCalmont, the
English race horse owner, after the
vessel had been rejected by the
United States, is now beirig fitted up
as a dispatch boat.
El Pais says, four warships have
been obtained by Spain in France
and that negotiations are pending for
the purchase of several torpedo boats
in Great Britain. El Pais also says
orders have been issued to mobilize
all the Spanish warships and that
the torpedo boat Eicon is to sail im
mediately from Cartagena for Ca
diz, where a second torpedo squadron
is being prepared. Military engineers
are starting for the Canary Islands
and the Balearic Islands are being
fortified.

CHARITY WITH NO RAKE-OFF.
SEATTLE. March 30. â An emissary of the Journal-Examiner has
a.bandoned his attempt to "work' 1 the people of this community to en
courage and contribute to yellow journal methods. Repeated efforts
â¢were made to induce the citizens here to organize and adopt means to
raise contributions for a monument to be erected in honor of the he
roes of the Maine disaster. When the fact became knovÂ»._ hrough the
columns of The ("all that their special representative sent from Ken-
York was to receive 10 per cent of the amount collected there was con
siderable indignation expressed. As a consequence nobody would have
anything to do with the project.
A new and legitimate movement, however, was begun, and Mayor
Thomas J. Humes called together twenty-one representative citizens
to consider ways and^ means of aiding the distress. The meeting was
held this evening and* an organization was effected by electin ? Mayor
Humes chairman, E. O. Graves treasurer, and Will A. Steel secretary.
It was decided to give a mammoth theatrical benefit from 1 to 5 o'clock
on the afternoon of April 16 in the principal theater.
Inhere will not be one dollar of expense, as the talent and everything
necessary have been volunteered. Every dollar of the receipts, which
will likely aggregate several thousand dollars, will be forwarded for
the benefit of the maimed survivors of the Maine and for the families
of the lost sailors.
according to El P_is, are going to the
Canary Islands to strengthen the
Spanish garrison there.
The Armstrongs' Spanish agent, a
Spaniard, who is in .touch with the
Government and commercial people
in Spain, has expressed the belief
that unless the powers intercede there
will be war.
He added: "If the United States :
offered money for our clearing out
of Cuba we could not accept, b\it if
the proposition emanated from an
other power it is not unlikely that
it would be accepted."
This view of the case is echoed by
a portion of the Spanish press' which
advises Spain to wash her hands of
Cuba.
Senor Ortiz de Sarato, a prominent
former Carlist deputy, who has just
. been defeated at Vittoria, expresses
the opinion that there would be no ,
war, saying: "We have neither ships, j
sailors, soldiers, plans nor money and
; the Government knows it. It will '
struggle to the last, then cave in."
Senor Sarato, who was recently at
' Cadiz, says the Spanish warships i

eminent announced ready for sea, !
cannot possibly be made ready sooner
than in two months.

McKinley Still Believes That Spain Will Yield
Without Fighting, but the Temper of America
Is Not to Be Trifled With.
NEW YORK, March 30.â The Herald's Washington correspond
ent telegraphs: "If I do not succeed in freeing Cuba by Monday I
wili ask Congress to declare Cuba free." WILLIAM McKINLBY.
There is an armistice over the Cuban
question, and it is not between Blanco
and Gomez. It is between the Presi
dent and Congress, and it will last until
Monday. President McKinley has
promised members of Congress that if
he is not able to report to them by
that time that the independence of Cuba
has been assured he will be ready to co
operate with them in any policy they
desire to f>rmulate.
Thus, from chaos to cosrros. the
events of this historic day have marched
rapidly. The day opened with both
houses of Congress ready to take the
question of the peace of the world out
of the President's hands. Unquestion
ably an overwhelming majority in both
houses favored such a step.
There were several reasons for this.
In the first place, everybody in Con
gress believed that the President had
been influenced on the side of peace so
powerfully as to lose sight of all the
issues involved. Unfounded though
their suspicion may have been, they felt
they would be willing to meet Spain
half way on matters that within their
opinion could possibly admit of com
promise. For instance, they thought

RECONCENTRATION IN
THE EASTERN PROVINCES
IS NOW AT AN END.
"WASHINGTON, March 30.â The Spanish legation here late to
night received a cablegram from the Governor-General of Cuba,
saytng the caotain-general reported the pacification of the eastern
pio-.inces bo fa; advanced that it had b^n decided to rescind the
reconcentrado order in these provinces and allow all subjects of
this decree to return to their homes in the country-
To aid in the re-establishing of the reconcentrados upon their
farms the cablegram stated the Government will grant them the
protection of the Spanish military forces augmented by local re
lief committees to look 'after their immediate needs.
Economic kitchens, it says, are to be established to support the
reconcentrados while waiting for their first croos to mature, and
they are to be furnished farming implements and seeds by the Gov
ernment. To supply them with ready money, such of them as are
able will be given employment on public works, and it is asserted
by the authorities that these measures will result in the speedy re
habilitation of the rural communities in the western provinces.
This cablegram was not made public till more than an hour
after midnight and no official comment upon its significance could
be secured.
they saw evidences of a willingness to
i arbitrate the question t of the Maine ex
; plosion and of a compromise on the
j Cuban question short of absolute inde
| pendence.
In the second place, the Congress
men had been hearing from their con-
I stituents, and most of them were afraid
!to go home if decisive action against
1 Spain were not taken promptly.
The President began to hear from
the members of- both houses early. The
Senate "steering" committee called, and
with many wags of the hesd told him
they were sorry for him and favored a
\ conservative policy, but the Senate was
, "gone." The entire Michigan deiega
: tion went in and told him the people of
the Wolverine State believed we should
j declare war against Soain. Members of
the House Committee on Foreign Af
j fairs also appeared and said the House
was about to act independently of the
executive unless it had definite infor
! mation. Dozens of others, members of
, the Senate and House, told the Presi
dent they were sorry to come to the
parting of the ways, but they were
going to speak and vote for armed in
tervention in Cuba.
Then it was that the President bowed
to the wishes of Congress and took his
callers into his confidence to a limited
degree. He explained that he could not
yet make public the correspondence
with Spain, because it was still being
conducted. The negotiations had been
| delayed in Madrid. He expected a
| definite answer to-morrow night. But
| in the most positive words the Presi
| dent informed his callers that he was
second in patriotism to no man. and that
he was demanding of Soain exactly
what Congress wanted. He" believed
that the negotiations would result in the
independence of Cuba.
If Congress forced him to break them
off no one could foretell the result.
We would be placed in a false light be
fore the world. The President asked
for forty-eight hours' time, if Congress
would give him no more.
He also said to one caller: "If
I do not succeed in freeing Cuba by
Monday I will ask Congress to de
clare Cuba free."
â¢ Monday being the extreme limit
of time asked by the President, it has
been decided by Congress to give him
until Monday.
In view of the incident in the House
when Representative Bailey of Texas

PROTECTION FOR
SPAIN'S COASTS.
Copyrtght, 1898. by James Gordon Ben
nett.
BARCELONA, March 30.â The
feeling that war is probable is
apparent from the feverish way
in which measures for protecting
the Catalan coast Â«md increas
ing the naval forces are dis
cussed, subscriptions for these
purposes being offered from all
parts of Spain.
tried to get ah^ad of the procession by
securing immediate consideration of a
resolution recognizing the independence
of Cuba, this becomes <-Â«~nificant. There
was no reason on earth mtc it should
have had the slightest effect on the price
of stocks. It was not indicative of the
sense of the House. Mr. Hopkins, who
opposed it on the floor afterward, was
chairman of the conference of nq Re
publican members who favored armed
intervention.
Speaker Reed, during the discussion,
showed plainly that hz too had yielded,
and had done it as gracefully as the
President had. The conference which
the Republican members held to-nierht
to advance the cause of armed interven
tion unless Spain immediately declares
Cuba free really removes the last ves
tige of doubt as to what the House will
do. It was a remarkable event. There
was no clap-trap â no fireworks. The
men who talked meant what they said.
They all said Spain must leave Cuba.
The 115 will be 204 when the House
votes. The Republican strength is 204.
A committee of eleven was appointed
to wait on the President to-morrow and
tell him there must be no hesitation and
no drawing back.
As for the Senate, the a: durances the
President sent to that body were suffi
cient to cause a change in its poiicy.
The Senate, too, will wait until Monday.
The authorities await with the great
est anxiety a definite proposition as to
just how Spain proposes to let go of
the island. While the President and
Congress are in accord in their desire
for the freedom of Cuba there is some
difference between the demands made
upon Spain and what Congress expects.
The President, for instance, would be
willing to agree to an armistice, with a
guarantee from Spain beforehand that
the Cubans should have their indepea2
WILL BUY ONE
WARSHIP FROM
THE CHILEANS
The Oregon May Not Be Alone
on Y}er Cruise to Join
tf)e North Atlantic
Squadron.
NEW YORK, March 30.â A Washington special to the Herald says:
Anticipating that Chile will sell a man-of-war to the United States, Com
mander F. M. Symonds, commanding the gunboat Marietta, has been
ordered to proceed at once from Callao to Valparaiso, where he will
hoist the American flag on board the vessel. Before his departur > from
Callao Commander Symonds, it is expected, will make arrangements for
the collection of a sufficient supply of coal to be placed immediately
aboard the battleship Oregon, due at that point the first of next week,
so that there will be no delay in her race against time around the
Horn. It is proposed to place the crew of the Marietta on board the
Chilean cruiser to be purchased in case negotiations are successful
and the new addition to the American navy will join the Oregon in
her voyage to this country east, while the Marietta, in charge of a
short crew, will work her way north, until she falls in with the Alert,
which will place a portion of her crew aboard and the two will then
proceed to Mare Island. Should the negotiations for a Chilean cruiser
fall through the Marietta will steam with the Oregon to Key West.
The officials recognize that it is of vital importance that this Gov
ernment should obtain possession of another arr ored cruiser before
â war with Spain occurs. It is admitted that the armed cruiser O'Hig
grins, which is completed at Elswick, England, is not for sale; the* the
Argentine Government has declined to sell the cruiser San Martine,
practically compl *ed at Leghorn, Italy, and that the Italian Govern
ment will not dispose of any other completed cruiser.
It is believed this Government is endeavoring to purchase the Blan
co EnciJada/ which has been in commission in the Chilean service for
three or four years. This vessel has a displacement of 4500 tons and a
speed of 22.7 knots and has an armament consisting of two 8-inch
breech-loading rifles, two 10-inch quick-firing guns in sponsons, twelve
3-pounders, twelve 1-pounders and five torpedo tub- The only battle
ship in the Chilean service which this Government has considered with a
view to possible purchase is the Captain Pratt, but It is not believed
that Chile will be willing to sell her.
With such a vessel as the Blanco Encalada accompanying the Ore
gon the authorities* do not anticipate that these ships would have any
difficulty in disposing of the Spanish torpedo gun vessel Temerario,
which is thought to be lying in wait for the American ships in order to
prevent them reaching Key West in case war should be declared.
It is officially denied at the Navy Department that any negotia
tions are being conducted with Denmark for the sale of ai.v of her
vessels. It is said that there are no ships in the Danish navy which
would be worth anything to the United States in th; present crisis.
It is also stated that no authority has been given to naval attaches
of this Government abroad to purchase any additional torpedo-boats
and it is doubted by the officials that this Government will be able to
proc- re any more vessels of this type by purchase. The torpedo-boat
Somers, purchased at Elbing, left that point, according to a dispatch
from Lieutenant J. J. Knap, received at the Navy Department to-day,
for PHlau, en route to the United States.
lieutenant Knap is under instructions to hasten his cruise as much
as possible across the Atlantic, and to be parti- 'larly watchful for
Spanish torpedo-boats.
dence when order has been restored and
sufficient time allowed for the formation
of a new government. Congress, how
ever, seems to demand recognition of
independence at once and an armistice
to come afterward. Independence only
guaranteed, however, there will prob
ably be little trouble about agreeing to
an armistice pending the organization of
the new government. Although the
authorities are not saying much on the
subject, it is well known that one of
the leading propositions before the Sa
gasta Ministry involves the question of
the purchase by the Cubans of their in
dependence.
It is known that all the moneyed in
terests of Europe are working on Spain
to have her accept the proposition for the
sale of Cuba, and that the financial inter
ests here are at work with the repre
sentatives of the Cuban reoublic for the
purpose of effecting an agreement on a
financial basis.
At Madrid there is a pause. Sagasta
asked for twenty-four hours of time and
got it. Madrid has also got a definite
statement that the concession of the in
dependence of Cuba can prevent inter
vention and that nothing else can.
When diplomacy gets that far it
is only a step to an ultimatum. In
this case it is only twenty-four hours
to an ultimatum.
While Madrid pauses the President
and Congress .are fully prepared for ac
tion, at last happily together. Two
cables came from Minister Woodford to
The State Department last night.
The first said that the Spanish Council
had asked for twenty-four hours' time
in which to consider the representations
which the United States had made re
garding Cuba and the Maine. Would
that time be granted? The reply to this
inquiry was "Yes."
The second cable was for further in
formation. Spain desired to know
whether it was to understand that the
concession of the independence of Cuba
was a prerequisite and an essential to
the granting of our desires about the
island. To this interrogatory the an
, ewer was also "Yes."
The first question explained the sec
ond. Spain had not realized that the
President was in a hurry until Minister
Woodford presented an urgent cable
requesting immediate information as to
Spain's willingness to comply with his
wishes. Then Sagasta saw that he was
confronted with the necessity for promot
action on momentous questions which
he had hoped to consider at his leisure.
So he asked for time, and then
asked definitely as to whether the
meeting of the question of the free
dom of Cuba was regarded as urgent
and pressing by Washington. He
now knows they are ominously urg
ent, feverishly pressing.
At the White House and at the State
Department there is a general air of
sprightliness which suggests unbounded
confidence that when the Sagasta Min
istry sends its reply at the end of the
fateful twenty-four hours it will be in
compliance with the administration's de
sires. Minister Woodford has been
sending roseate opinions as to the pros
pects.
There is skepticism everywhere else
as to the likelihood of Spain entering
into a definite agreement at this time to
give Cuba independence. It is believed
that Spain will submit a counter propo
sition embodying an armistice until Oc
tober, during which negotiations for the
independence of Cuba or for a more
liberal government can be conducted,
and conceding our right to feed the re
concentrados. Spain is expected to say
that the Ministry cannot act, the ces
sion "of territory can only be made by
the Cortes, and the Cortes does not
meet until April 23. On that ground
the Prime Minister will ask delay. But
no such period of waititlg is in the
President's mind, unless ttie Queen-
Regent, by some proclamation, binds
Spain to independence.
Spain's threatening movement in
sending more warships to the westward
does not conform harmoniously with the
pacific news from Madrid, and the op
timism shown at the State Department
does not prevail among officers of the
army and navy. I can state on high
authority that a reply asking for further
delay will not be satisfactory to this
Government, and that an ultimatum on
the independence of Cuba will be sent to
Madrid on the coming of that reply, or
any other that does not free Cuba.
There is to be no hesitation now. If
war must come, it will come without
more shifting of positions, and it will
come by Monday.
The question of hostilities at once was
discussed at the Cabinet meeting on
Tuesday. This meeting was a very long
one, lasting from 11 o'clock till nearly
2. The question of readiness was
brought up. It was considered that we
were ready. Then the question of strik
ing quickly was discussed. Several
members of the Cabinet were in favor
of immediate action the instant it be
came apparent that diplomatic relations
were broken â among them even the
men who have refused to consider that
there was a probability.
The consensus of opinion was that
if Spain's reply was not satisfactory
war should be declared on Saturday.
It should be borne in mind that when
this meeting was held Spain's final re
ply was expected to-day. The point
was made that if this country did not
strike at once the torpedo flotilla would
be at Cuba, and this would hamper our
operations. The danger of yellow fever
was pointed out, and it was the opinion
of all that if hostilities did not begin
soon all our operations around Cuba
would have to be deferred until Sep
tember. All this has been "ding
donged" into the ears of the Cabinet
by Assista-nt Secretary Roosevelt of the
Navy for weeks, but the impression it
made was dulled until Congress ex
ploded on the. President's hands and a
firm demand on Spain could be no
longer delayed.
Immediate cessation of hostilities.
Immediate relief for reconcen
trados through the co-operation of
the United States.
Prompt withdrawal of Spanish
troops and an armistice for a short
period, during which time the United
States will exert its good offices in
establishing an independent form of
government.
Concisely and bluntly these comprise
the demands which President McKin
ley has made upon Spain. The basis
and principle upon which the whole de
mand is made involves the indepen
dence of Cuba. Courteous diplo
matic language has of course been
used in nicking these representations to
Spain. The President was careful in
the phraseology of the several commu
nications which have within the last few
days gone to Madrid on this subject.
The most important one was the joint
production of the President. Fonrier
Senator Edmunds and Third Assistant
Secretary of State Adee. The notes
were so framed as not to hurt the sensi
bilities of the Spanish diplomats, but
at the same time to show that the
President was firm in his determination
that the time had now come for Spain to
end the war and concede the indepen
dence of the Cubans.

HAVANA, March 30.â 1 have the per

Dr. Congosto, the Secretary-General of
the Government, that they have no
knowledge of any plan for peace in
volving the declaration of an armistice
with the insurgents until October 1.
The first intimation received at Ha
vana of such a plan as contemplated
was contained in your dispatch stat
ing that the armistice was to last six
months, the United States meantime to
feed the starving reconcentrados. I
showed this dispatch to Dr. Congosto,
who received me courteously at the pal
ace:
VI will be perfectly frank with you,"
said Congosto. "If there is anything
in this proposition I do not know of
it. I have no knowledge that any such
plan has been proposed, officially or
otherwise."
I asked Dr. Congosto whether he
could also speak for the Captain-Gen
eral.
"Yes," he said. "You may Bay the
same for General Blanco. I am quite
sure that he knows no more of any such
plan than do I."
"Could you authorize the statement
that there is no truth in the report or
that Spain would not consent to such
an agreement?" I inquired.
"By no means. I cannot go as far as
that," Dr. Congosto' replied. "I can
only say that if such overtures have
been or are to be made, the entire af
fair must be in the hands of the Wash
ington and Madrid authorities. Please
observe, I do not say there is nothing
in this report. Some such proposition
may be under deliberation. I only say
that if that is the case the Govern
ment's representatives in Cuba do not
know of it."
Consul-General Lee appeared to be
Incredulous when I showed him the
dispatch! He said he had no infor
mation on the subject, and evidently
did not place much faith in the idea
that Spain and the insurgents might
both consent to six months' cessation
of hostilities. I have outlined the pro
posed plan to many representative Cu
bans who naturally prefer not to be
quoted by name. None of them believe
Gomez would subscribe to such an ar
rangement unless with absolute guar
antee that the independence of Cuba
should follow. The approach of the
rainy season has no terrors for Gomez
and his Cuban veterans. That has al
ways been his harvest time and the
time when the Spanish troops silffer the
greatest losses.
On the other hand, I find no greater
disposition among Spaniards to sub
scribe to any such proposed solution ot
the difficulty. The impression is grow
ing among them that Spain has the
sympathy and is likely to have the
support of several foreign powers. So
long as this belief exists the average
Spanish loyalist will not listen to talk
of an armistice with Maximo Gomez.
La Union Constitutional says edito
rially to-day: "If it Is confirmed that
there has been a change In President
McKinley's attitude, we must regard it
as due to two reasons, namely: First,
the severe attitude maintained by our
Government, never alarmed, knowing
as she does, the right and Justice of
her cause; secondly, the menacing atti
tude of the European powers, which
cannot with indifference look upon the
United States provoking a war in
which their own interests would suffer
so severely."
BROOKS HAD
MANY ALIASES
Swindler Arrested at Ta
coma Prominent in
the East.
Taught School for Twenty
Years in Michigan and
Wisconsin.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, March 80.â It develops that
Marion Brooks, arrested several weeks
ago for defrauding Eastern publishers,
was a prominent man back in Michigan
and Wisconsin, where he taught school
for twenty years, holding State certi
ficates. In Michigan he was known by
the name of Tripp, which is thought to
be his right name. In the West he
has gone under the names of Brooks,
Charles Brown, Charles Lyon and John
W. Wilson.
The Federal authorities allege that
Brooks has been using the mails with
intent to defraud Macmillan & Co.,
Rand, McNally & Co., Harper Brothers,
the Werner Company and several other
publishing houses. He has claimed to
be the clerk of school boards of Ta
coma and other cities, requesting the
publishers to send him consignments of
books to be paid for on arrival, His
supposed object was then to sell the
books to local book firms, pocketing
the proceeds. The Federal attorney's
office has advices that one consignment
of books sold in Seattle brought him
$150. He is known to have been in Los^
Angeles and his alleged operations in
other cities are being Investigated.
. Macmillan & Co. of Chicago and E.
F. Goodyear, Macmillan's agent at 319
Sansome street, San Francisco, were
instrumental in effecting Brooks' cap
ture. He wrote to the Chicago house
as Charles Lyon and to San Francisco
as John Wilson. The Chicago house
forwarded its order to San Francisco.
The difference in the names used
aroused suspicions. The agency here
was asked to investigate, its inquiry
resulting in the placing of the corre
spondence in the hands of the Federal
authorities, who captured Brooks at the
postoffice when he called for his mail.
It is believed Brooka will confess,
thereby reducing his probable sentence.
He spends his time in jail studyiuer
French and German and reading the
Bible. His family in Michigan does
not know of his trouble. He has prom
inent connections at Kenosha, Madison
and Pewaukee, Wls., and hopes to
guard his identity so they will not
learn of his disgrace.
WARLIKE MOVE
OF SPANIARDS
Three Warships Sent to
Join the Torpedo
Flotilla.
Madrid Taking Advantage of
the Time Still at Her
Command.
Amerioan Flying Squadron May Be
Ordered to Intercept the
Fleet.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW I'ORK, March-30.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: In di
rect contradiction of her promises to
peacefully settle the question existing
between herself and the United States
Spain to-day took an action having as
its object the re-enforcement of her fleet
in Cuban waters and the protection of
her torpedo-boat flotilla.
Minister Woodford informed the State
Department early this mor-ing that
the Spanish armored cruisers Cristobal
Colon and Infanta Maria Teresa and
the torpedo-boat destroyer Destructor
had. left Carthagena for an unknown
destination but when last seen they
were steaming to the wes'ward. Min
ister Woodford's information was ob
tained from the consular agent of the
United States at Carthagena, who, in
company with other consular officers of
this Government in Spain had been in
structed to report to the Minister all
movements of Spanish men-of-war.
As an offset to the Spanish movement
the strategic authorities of the Navy
Department are seriously contemplat
ing the issuance of orders to Commo
dore W. S. Schley, commanding the fly
ing -squadron, directing him to move
with his command down the coast to
Savannah or some other point which
will place him several hundred miles
nearer Porto Rico. Its first duty will
be to dispose, if possible, of the Span
ish, torpedo-boat flotilla, which will not
arrive at Porto Rico, it is officially es
timated, before April 7, and, when this
has been destroyed, the squadron will
turn its attention to the vessels which
left Spain to-day.
There is considerable speculation in
official naval circles as to the first
point at which the Cristobal Colon, the
Infanta Maria Teresa and the De
structor will touch, and it was sug
gested that they might proceed to
the Canaries and from that point sail
for the United States. What is, how
ever, considered* more probable by na
val experts is that the Spanish Gov
ernment, anticipating war, has sent
these vessels at th- ir highest rate of
speed to join the torpedo boat flotilla,
which, it is believed, is 1200 miles from
the Canaries, and therefore has 1400
miles to cover befure reaching Porto
Rico.
To comply with the plan of campaign
prepared by the department it is first
necessary to dispose of the flotilla, and
when this has been accomplished to
have the flying squadron give battle to
the Cristobal Colon, the Infanta Maria
Teresa and the Destructor and the de
feat, of these for^te will be much easier
and safer providing they can be met
separately. Combined they would make
a force which the flying squadron could
hardly meet with safety. This flotilla
consists of seven seagoing torpedo
boats, anil if re-enforced they would
have a destroyer of 386 tons and two of
the finest armored cruisers in the world
to aid them against an attacking force.
Comparing the Broo-klyn and Texas
with the Cristobal Colon and the In
fanta Maria Teresa, the â authorities say
that the American ships would have a
most difficult task to come off victors,
but in view of the superiority of the
American sailors over those of Spain,
it is believed that an engagement be
tween the four ship 3 would result in
success for the ships flying the stars
and stripes. With the Cristobal Colon
and Infanta Maria Teresa re-enforced
by the Destructor and seven torpedo
boats, the latter composing the flo
tilla, it is appreciated that Commodore
Schley's squadron would have to be in
creased in order to gain a victory with
out any great difficulty.
It is the question of these contingen
cies that has caused the authorities to
discuss the advisability of having the
flying squadron leave Hampton Roads
"and drop down the coast to a point
nearer Porto Rico than their present
anchorage. If the torpedo boat flotilla
is to be destroyed before the armored
cruisers and the Destructor can re-en
force them this work will have to be
done by the armored cruiser Brooklyn
and the protected cruisers Columbia
and Minneapolis, leaving the battle
ship Massachusetts and the second
class battle-ship Texas join these ves
sels later.
The Brooklyn, Minneapolis and Co
lumbia could reach Porto Rico from
Hampton Roads in about seventy-five
hours and c^uld proceed on their way
to meet the flotilla In case it had not
reached Porto Rico up to the time of
their arrival. The Massachusetts and
Texas would not be able to reach Porto
Rico under five days.
On the other hand, the Spanish arm
ored cruisers and destroyers, it is esti
mated by the officials, can overtake the
torpedo-boat flotilla within six days
and possibly in less time. In view of
the belief of the authorities that the
Spanish naval officials, anticipating
trouble, directed the torpedo boats to
proceed with such deliberation that
they could be easily overtaken by re
enforcements, it is appreciated that it
would mean annihilation to the Brook
lyn, Columbia and Minneapolis to at
tack the combined force without sup
port from the Texas and Massachu
setts. The move of Spain in this mat
ter is. therefore, appreciated to have
been the result of careful thought and
every day of delay in bringing- matters
to an extreme issue will result in im
portant advantage to the Spanish navy.
"The trouble is," said an official to
me to-day, "we have delayed too long.
We ought to have begun the war by
March 1, at least, if we were to have
it."

VALLEJO, March SO.â The navy
I yard is dark to-night. For the first
| time since the war scare gave such an
I impetus to the work there the night
! shift has been allowed to stay away.
! It was found that some of the men were

night work go for at least one night
in the week.
The steamer Modoc tied up at the

and during the noon hour the men lined
!up to receive therr money. There were
806 men paid off, involving an amount
close to $30,000. This number does not
represent all the men at work, for
there are over 200 more who did not go

LOCAL DEMOCRATS
OUT FOR WAR
Strong Resolutions Passed at
the Meeting of the Central
Club.
A Number of Auxiliary Com
mitteemon Are Ap
pointed.
The meeting of the Central Democratic
Club last evening was an unexpected suc
cess, both In point of numbers and en
thusiasm manifested. A feature of the
evening was the stirring resolutions
passed In relation to the impending inter
national crisis growing out of the Cuban
war and the sinking of the Maine. W. P.
Stradley made a short speech in which he
dwelt upon the existing state of affairs
in the island, and then presented the fol
lowing resolutions, which were unani
mously adopted:
Whereas, The war now waging in the island
Of tuba between the armies of Spain and the
Cuban patriots has been conducted by the hpan
tÂ«h monarchy in utter violation of all the
rules of civilizc-'l warfare and has now degen
erated into a deliberate and barbarous scene
of starvation and extermination; and whereas,
the Monroe doctrine, which has become a dis
tinctively American policy, to the enforcement
of which the faith and manhood of this coun
try stand pledged, forbids the Interference
of foreign powers in the affairs of any State
or nation on the Western Hemisphere; there-
Resolved, That Christian civilization and
common humanity alike demand the rigid en
forcement of said Monroe doctrine against the
Spanish monarchy to the end that the Cuban
patriots shall be what of right they ought to
be a free and independent people, and that. If
necessary, said policy shall be executed by
force of arms.
And whereas, the good battleship Maine
was, while peaceably at anchor in the
harbor of Havana, at a place designated
by the Spanish authorities, within the do
minion and under the control of the kingdom
of Spain, maliciously destroyed by a subma
rine mine and he brave sailors without a mo
ment's warning treacherously mangled and
murdered: therefore b& it
Resolved, That the United States should im
mediately demand full reparation for said gross
outrage at the hands of Spain and enforce the
same, if need be, with the armed forces of the
United States.
President Charles H. Holcomb intro

man states th.it the accident, which has
resulted fatally, was no fault of his, and
he expressed his satisfaction when he
was released on his own recognizance by
Judge Conlan.
GEN. HARRISON
FAVORS ARMED
INTERVENTION
One of the Reasons Why He Will
Not Go Into the Cabinet
as Sherroan's Suc
cessor.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., March 30.â Benjamin Harrison left for the
Eastat 240 o'clock this afternoon. His sudden departure gave rise
to several rumors. One of these is that he may succeed John Sher
man as Secretary of State, and another is that he has been called
into conference with the President and the men who are trying to de
cide what the policy of the nation shall be at this time. The former
President with his usual reticence, refused to talk of his mission, but
his private secretary. E. F. Tibbott, assured Inquirers thtt the general
was going to New York on legal business. There was the further as-
Burance that a visit to Washington was not contemplated.
For several days the suggestion has been going the rounds In In
diana that it would be wisdom on the part of the President to Invite
General Harrison to become Secretary of State, and have the benefit
of his advice at this critical time, but whenever the suggestion has
been made in the presence of men who are acquainted with the former
President's views, the improbability of such a step has been pointed
out. It is stated by men who probably know that General Harrison
has not been in accord with the Cuban policy of the President, and
that under such circumstances he could not consider an offer to enter
the Cabinet. â ,
"General Harrison has distinct views on this subject, said one of
his friends, "and without violating any confidence it may be stated
that if he had been in the President's chair something definite would
have been done before this time."
Ex-President Harrison, according to his closest friends, holds to the
belief that this nation ought to have driven Spain out of Cuba by this
time. He has been telUng his callers for two weeks that the time had
come for armed intervention.
DAN DE QUILLE
IS NO MORE
William "Wright Passes
Away in an lowa
Town.
Was a Contemporary of Mark
Twain in the Early Days
of Nevada.
Spent Thirty Years as a Local Writer
on the Territorial Enterprise
of Virginia City.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VIRGINIA CITY, March 30.â News
has just reached here that William
Wright (Dan De Quille) died at the
home of his daughter at West Lafay
ette, lowa, on March 16. He was one
of the Comstock pioneers, arriving here
in 1859, and mined in Gold Canyon, near
Johntown, Lyon County. During his
sojourn there he furnished mining and
other Items for the Comstock papers.
Wright began his journalistic career
as a local writer on the Territorial En
terprise in 1860 and held- that position
continuously for nearly thirty years.
He was associated at various times
with writers who subsequently attain
ed celebrity, among them were Mark
Twain, 'R. M. Daggett and C. C. Good
win. In 1876 he resigned his position
for a few months and went to the home
of his former associate, Mark Twain,
where he revised material for a volume
issued that year entitled, "Big Bonan
za," the funds for which were furnish
ed by John W. Mackay. The book
proved a poor investment, as the con
tents related exclusively to men promi
nent in the history of Nevada, the
Comstock Lode and the State mining
industry; therefore it was devoid of
general interest.
From 1876 until 1888 Wright was em
ployed as local writer on the Enter
prise, and about the latter date he en
tered the field of romance, writing short
stories for popular magazines and syn
dicate letters for various publications.
Becoming too feeble to continue his
literary work, he left for his daughter's
home last fall, where his busy life
ended.
He possessed an inexhaustible fund
of material gathered in his long jour
nalistic career, was a marvelously pro
lific writer of deep scientific knowledge
and had the faculty of investing com
monplace matter with interest.
Through all of his productions a quaint
vein of humor is discernible.
PUTATIVE. CHILDREN

STOCKTON, March 30.â Kasson
will case, over which there has been such
a great legal struggle, in which so many
lawyers have been engaged on both sides
arid during which there have been so
many sensations, was decided in favor of
the defense by Judge Jones to-day. The
case was submitted without argument,
and the decision defeats George W. Tindy
and Mrs. Mann, who alleged that they
were legitimate children of Kasson, the
deceased capitalist.. There was more than
$500,000 involved 1 in the case." :
After all the evidence was in this after
noon the attorneys for the claimants
moved for a, continuance, and created a
sensation by reading affidavits: stating
that i they could 'prove by the court rec
ords of St. Louis that no divorce was
granted to Mary A. Kasson between 1847
and 1573.' Numerous witnesses in Los An
geles. Arkansas and Missouri were named
by whom they could prove that the testi
mony of Mrs. Malloy was untrue that
she had children and that r she" was not
the Mary Hayden who married George
M. Kasson. v â  ...-i^ ' '

It Is Upon the Promise That
There Will Be Speedy Action
in Cuba's Behalf.
Call Office, Rlggs House,
Washington, March 30.
A wild and uproarious scene occurred
frn the Kouse to-day when Mr. Bailey,
the Democratic leader, attempted to
force the hand of the Republicans upon
a proposition to overrule the Speaker
and pass a resolution recognizing the
independence of the Cuban republic. He
â was cheered on by the crowded galler
ies, but the members of the majority
refused to support him.
Many of them sympathized with the
purpose of the resolution, Mr. Hull,
chairman of the Military Committee,
going so far as to indorse the propo
sition under the impression that it pro
vided for a declaration of war, but most
of the radicals, and who yesterday
were in fdvor of any sort of revolution
ary method, had been won over to the
policy of sticking to the party organi
zation and refusing to do anything un
til the initiative came from their side.
They were rallied by two of the lead
ing advocates of armed intervention.
The Speaker himself from the
chair made an indirect appeal to his
party associates to stand firm, at the
same time intimating that if their
impatience was curbed a little longer
they would have the opportunity
they coveted.
When the vote was taken only two
Republican*, Messrs. Achison and Rob
bins of Pennsylvania, broke, from the
party lines. About a dozen more sat
in thÂ°ir seats and refused to vote.
The scene throughout was most dra
matic and members and spectators in
the galleries wore wrought up to a high
pitch of excitement. Several times,
later in the day, during the considera.
tion of the naval bill, whenever the
Cuban question was broached, the
members swarmed around the Speaker
and the galleries cheered. This was
especially the cas%when Mr. Cummings
of New York spoke. Mr. Boutelle, who
objected to a request for extension of
his time, was hissed. The only im
â .t ".-â !'<â¢, i on the naval bill to-day
was the refusal of the chair to sustain
a point of order against the provision
for a floating steel dock at Algiers, La.
The storm broke immediately after
the reading of the journal, when Mr.
Bailey, the Democratic leader, demand
ed recognition as a matter of privilege
and offered a resolution. A profound
F-ensation followed. Members rose en
J|-.;isse all over the House. No one knew
ft' hat the resolution contained, but all
Knew it related to the aJI-absorbing
topic of Cuba-
Evans (R.) of Kentucky interposed
to declare that a pension bill coming
over from last night was in order and
amid Intense excitement the Speaker,
with white, stern face, held that the
regular order was the consideration of
the pension bill, which he directed the
clerk to read.
While it was being read, Mr. Bailey
requested that the resolution be sent
back to him. As soon as the pension
bill was passed he was again on his
feet demanding recognition. But Mr.
Eoutelle, chairman c-f the Naval Affairs
Committee, was also calling for recog
nition and the Speaker recognized him,
pausing amid the clamor and confusion
to inform Mr. Bailey calmly that his
rights would be respected.
Mr. Boutelle then moved that the
House go into committee of the whale
and resume the consideration of the na
val appropriation bill.
"Pending that motion," announced
the Speaker, "the gentleman from
Texas says he desires to present a
privileged question. The gentleman
will state it."
Mr. Bailey then offered the resolu
tion for the recognition of the inde
pendence of Cuba, as follows:
Resolved, By the Senate and House
of Representatives, that the heroic
struggle of the Cuban people against
the force of arms and the horrors of
famine has shown them worthy to be
free; and,
Resolved, That the United States
hereby recognizes the republic of
Cuba as an independent State.
The reading was listened to amid si
lence profoundly impressive, and at its
conclusion cheer after cheer was given
from the galleries and the floor. The
Republican side was ominously silent.
The Speaker rapped vigorously for or
der and warned the galleries that no
demonstrations would be allowed.
Mr. Boutelle immediately made the
point of order that the resolution was
n&t privileged and upon that Mr. Bailey
demanded to be heard. He said the
subject with which the resolution dealt
was too serious and the occasion too
Important to be hastily disposed of. He
Insisted that he had a ritrht to present
the resolution under the rules and
rulings and the responsibility must rest
with the majority if it was ruled out of
order, and the ruling sustained.
He called attention to the fact that
in the Fifty-third Congress, when Mr.
Crisp was Speaker. Mr. Boutelle, who
now made the point of order that this
resolution was not privileged, presented
a resolution of a similar character re
lating to Hawaii, which the Speaker
held was privileged, but must go to
committee. Against that latter ruling
an appeal was taken and the whole Re
publican side had voted against tabling
the appeal. Whon ho said that at the
head of a list of distinguished Repub
licans who voted on that occasion was
the honorable Speaker of this House j
the Democrats went into rapturous ap
plause.
Meantime the confusion was great.
The Republican leaders were evidently
rallying their forces. Hull, chairman of
the Committee on Military Affairs, who
was one of the prime factors in the
movement for prompt and vigorous ac
tion on the Republican side, came for
ward with a strong appeal to Republi
cans not to be carried off their feet.
At the outset he acknowledged that
his sympathies were with the resolu
tion (which it appeared afterward, he
believed at that time contained a de
claration of war) but he argued that
I lid not present a'question of higher
vilege than the consideration of an
Dropriation bill. We could have war,
said, whenever we wanted it. A
olution declaring war was a privi
e, he admitted.
L?ut this is not a resolution declar
j war," interposed Bland. "It is a
resolution recognizing the independence
of Cuba, which does not necessarily in
lilve war."
'If the resolution falls short of that,"
plied Hull, "and I did not hear It
lly read â if it falls short of that
Int, it is not operative and to my
md it does not present any question
privilege at all. As I have always
id, I am in favor of this Government
tervening at the very earliest date
iless conditions change materially, so
at they will insure the liberty of Cu
bans and a cessation of the deplorable
conditions that prevail in that island at
this time. (Applause on the Republi
can side.)
"I am in favor of that principle, and
state now and here that I will go as
far as any man on this floor for the
.purpose of preserving the rights of the
struggling patriots in their heroic ef
forts on that island; (applause on the
Republican side); and I am in favor of
the United States controlling the des
tinies of this continent and saying to
Spain that she must get out of the
western hemisphere."
Mr. Terry (D.) of Arkansas argued
that a question involving a matter of
privilege was, in fact, one for the House
to decide.
While he was speaking tli9 Re
publicans were conferring. The lead
ers were circulating among them and
such confusion resulted that JLt.
Simpson (Pop.) of Kansas raised a
laugh amid the excitement by ask
ing for orders among the "Speaker's
reconcentrados. "
Mr. Hopkins (R.) of Illinois, another
of the Republicans who openly favors
armed intervention, called attention to
the distinction between the resolution
in the precedent recited by Mr. Bailey
and the present resolution. In the
former resolution it was contended that
the dignity of the House had been in
fringed upon by the executive. There
was no such contention here. Contin
uing he appealed to his colleagues to
rally to the support of the Speaker.
The Republican members knew, he
said, that within a brief time action
would be had, so that there was no ne-
Plty for resorting to revolutionary
lods.
nid profound silence the Speaker
"made his ruling. He spoke in de
ate, distinct and emphatic tones
decided that the resolution was not
privileged in the following ruling:
A question of privilege which concerns
the House is one whicn concerns the ex
ercise of its functions in accordance with
the principles which govern parliamen
tary bodies. Every parliamentary body
has to have rules for its government,
otherwise it would have ro government
at all, and upon adherence to these rules
depends its success as a parliamentary
body. The rights of the House under the
constitution are in no way to be con
founded with privileges of the House and
of every member of it in me sense this
j matter is presented here to-day. Congress
j has certain powers conferred upon it, and
jin the exercise of those powers each
House is governed by its rules. It is au
thorized expressly by the constitution to
make rules, and without the authorization
of the constitution it would be at liberty
to make rules. These rules are the pro
tection of the rights of the House. Now
it would be noticed in the constitution, if
any gentleman will turn to it, that there
are certain powers conferred upon Con
gress, the power to declare war, the
â¢power to legislate for the general welfare
and a series of other enumerated powers.
[ No man up to this date has for an in
stant pretended or suggested that because
Congress ha.s the right to pass laws upon
certain topics that proposals for these
laws become questions of privilege; never
before, except once, and the chair will
present the decision to the House. The
same language is used with reference to
our relations with foreign nations that is
used with reference to tlie creation of the
courts of law and all other power which is
concerned.
It is a legislative power and is exercised
under the constitution by rules adopted
IV each body. This i.Â« the preliminary
idea that we ought to have in regard to
this matter. J}ut this proposition in re
gard to the war, or about recognition, or
[ any of thosr- subjects which may or may
not be within our purview, do not become
questions of privilege at all because we
have a right to pass upon them, because
that would make everything a question of
privilege and end by making nothing a
question of privilege. Now let us see
what this is founded on. This is a mat
ter that we should not have given any an
swer to, except in times of interest, not
to say excitement. The gentleman from
Maine (Boutelle) some time ago presented
to Speaker Crisp a proposition which had
in it certain elements charging that the
executive was interfering with some of
the rights and privileges of the legisla
tive body. The Speaker ruled that it was
a question of privilege, and you will per
ceive that it is entirely different from the
present proposition, has no aspect like it
at all; not the faintest resemblance to it;
but, the Speaker ruled that that was a
privileged question. He also ruled that,
being a privileged question, it should go
to a committee.
Well, now, to that doctrine the chair
has always been opposed, and the ques
tions, as members will see by turning to
the Record, that were put to the House
were on that part of the Speaker's de
cision as to whether it should go to
committee or no, and if it appears, as t
gentleman from Texas says. I voted o
that subject, I voted according to m
rights and voted against it. But he ha
omitted to state to you that this oth
question, the same question almost, wÂ«
put before Speaker Crisp, and by hi
promptly decided to be out of o*rder.
an earlier day, on the 30th of July, 1894.
The gentleman from Maine (Mr. Bo
telle) demanded its immediate consider
tion as presenting a privileged questio
and the gentleman from Missouri, an o
and experienced member (Mr. Dockerj
made the point of order that the resol
tion was not privileged, daughter an
applause on the Republican side.] We
now, as a matter of course, the Speak
sustained the pointâ and that is precise
this question.
Bailey â May I inquire of the chair if
there was any appeal taken on the de
cision of the chair?
The Speaker â There was no appeal.
It was too clear for an appeal even.
(Laughter and applause from the Re
publican side.)
Bailey immediately appealed from
the decision of the chair.
In putting the question on the ap
peal. Speaker Reed made the follow-
THE SAIST FRANCISCO CALL., THUBSDAY, MARCH 31, 1898.
ing significant and impressive state-
ment:
As far as any question arising out
of this matter is concerned, the
chair has not the slightest doubt that
the wisdom of the House, which has
always been able to arrive at im
portant questions in a suitable way,
will get at them at a speedy time for
the occasion. (Applause on Republi
can side.)
Baileyâ ln reply to that suggestion,
which was not a part of the decision,
of course. I understand that it was
made to hold oui friends on the other
side and I venture to .say
At this point Boutejle moved that the
appeal be laid upon the table.
The division was eagerly awaited.
The Republicans arose en masse when
the Speaker called for the ayes. The
Democrats, who anxiously surveyed the
solid phalanx, for a sign of a break,
were disappointed. A solid minority
voted against the Republicans. The
division resulted, 180 ayes to 130 noes.
As soon as the result was announced
the ayes and noes were demanded and
the roll was called, resulting: Ayes,
180; noes, 139. On the roll call two
Republicans, Atcheson and Robbins of
Pennsylvania, voted vith the Demo
crats.
The Republicans enthusiastically ap
proved their victory with a round of
applause.
A parliamentary wrangle followed
over an attempt of Mr. Bailey to ap
peal from what he contended was a
ruling of the chair.
The House then went into committee
of the whole and resumed consideration
of the naval appropriation bill. Mr.
Cannon (R.) of Illinois, chairman of the
Appropriations Committee, made a
point of order against the paragraph
authorizing the construction of a float
ing steel drydock at Algiers, La. The
chair overruled the point of order.
From time to time during the after
noon the Cuban question was brought
forward and aroused intense feeling.
Wheeler (D.) of Alabama said this
morning- that the country had been
stirred u^ by the announcement that
the Republicans had at last revolted
and action was to be taken. To-mor
row the --merlean people would be hu
miliated when they found that the Re
publicans of the House had joined the
temporizir>' -^olicy which was betraying
the American Government and the
American name.
Cummin gs (D.) of New York â
How much time would it require, re
garding the prospective alliance be
tween the Government of Spain and
the United States, to put down the
patriots of CubaP (Great applause in
the galleries.)
"With my head bowed In humilia
tion," reolied Wheeler, "I have watched
how matters have gone, but I do not
believe the administration will go so
far as to extend a friendly hand to the
murderers of the sailors of the Maine
and the patrit +s of Cuba." (Renewed
I applause.)
Cummings. speakinr to an amend
ment, aroused the galleries to a high
pitch of enthusiasm.
"That there will be war between this
j country and Spain ' he said "is indi
cated by every pulsation of the popu
! lar heart to-day. I have received from
! my own constituents this batch of let
ters in one mail, asking me why my
voice is silent at this time, asking me
j why, after I have visited Cuba and
know the facts, I remain silent. Now,
Mr. Chairman, I shall not vote for any
$400,000 appropriation to feed the recon-
I centrados of Cuba until this Govern
i ment explicitly says to Bianco and to
1 Sagasta: 'Repeal your Weyler order,
i which is starving these people.' (Ap
plause.) There is the place to take
the initiative. Make them repeal the
murderous orders of Weyler. From
even a Spanish standpoint or a Wey
ler standpoint it is no longer necessary
that th^t order should continue in
force. It is an utter impossibility, un
less they bring their provisions wirh
them, for Gomez and Garcia to march
into the western provinces of Cui>a_
j Therefore I say that the initiative
! should be peremptorily demanded by
this Government for the repeal of the
Weyler order. When that is done feejl
the reconcentrados if you please. First
give them homes, give them plows, give
them oxen. And in God's name, send
them back to the blackened ashes of
their homes and give them the oppor
tunity to raise provisions for them
selves." (Applause.)
Mr. Boutelle objected to an extension
of Cumrnings' time beyond the five
minute limit and was hissed by the gal
leries.
Without reaching the provisions re
lating to the increase in the navy the
committee rose and at 6:05 o clock the
House adjourned.

When the orders were received the
news traveled like wild fire through the

while regarding the preparations for
departure with envious eyes, congrat

SPUN SEEKING
AID IN EUROPE
Sends a Note to the
Powers on the Ameri
can Trouble.
France Is Ready to Make a
Move to Assure
Peace.
It Is Only Necessary for the United
States to Signify Its
Willingness.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, March 30.
It was stated to-day in a high dip
lomatic quartc. that the 7 >anish Gov
ernment within the last ten days had
addressed v te to the great powers
of Europe fully setting forth the grave
aspect of the controversy with the
United States and at least ' 'ergntially
suggesting that the time iS now op
portune for European influences to be
exerted. It is sa' " that this note led to
the utterance of Premier Hanotaux in
the French Chamber last Saturday and
has been the cause of activity at Eu
ropean capitals within the last few
days in connection with Spanisn-
American affairs. Up to the present
time, however, no actual step toward
mediation or intervention has been
taken by any foreign pow-r, although
there is little d >Ã¼bt that France stands
ready to take >c initiative if there ia
the slightest evidence that the United
States Government will view such a
move with favor. The French Embas
sador at Washington, M. Cambon. has
received no definite instructions direct
ing him to tender the good offices oi
France. At the same time the Em
bassador. taking the cue from the re
marks of Premier Hanotaux, has called
on Judge Day and has said that if this
Government at any time feels that the
French Government can aid in avert
ing the present crisis and maintaining
peace he has no doubt that France will
readily undertake to exert such good
offices as will be acceptable to both
powers. This, as stated, is not a formal
tender by the French Government, for
as yet the French Embassador has re
ceived no positive instructions, but it
clearly indicates the tendency and wil
lingness of France to act as mediator
in the present emergency at any mo
ment. It is probable that the sugges
tions ha- c not taken a more formal
form owir"- to the delicate character
of such overtures.
A tender of good offices is one of the
last resorts of diplomacy, when all
other means of averting war seem to
be at an end. There is additional dif
ficulty from the fact that when two
nations are involved in a crieis any-ex
ternal influence may be resented as an
intrusion. There is reason to believe
that the French authorities are fully
conscious of these delicate and difficult
phases and that no F r Â«?p will be made
unless it is clearly apparent in advance
that the United States desires the
friendly office?? of other nations.
The Spanish Government has earn
estly hoped within the last week that
sony- of the European powers and more
likely Austria or France, would take
the initiative without waiting to con
sult the desires of this Government.
This hope has proved vain, however,
and it is said to-day on high author
ity that recent negotiations in Europe
have disclosed positively that while
the sympathy of some of the continen
tal powers was toward Spain, no one
of them stood ready to espouse her
cause by mediation or by arms. Most
has been expected of Austria, owing
to the dynastic relations between Aus
tria and Spain.
Up to the present time, however,
Austria has not felt ready to take the
initiative. The reports from Vienna
last night that the Austrian Minister
of Foreign Affairs. Count Goluchowski,
had instructed the Austrian represen
tative at Washington to co-operate in
the steps to be taken by France, are
not borne out by any actual develop
ments which have thus far occurred
here. The Austrian Minister has not
been at the State Department the pres
ent week nor have any suggestions in
this line been received by the State De
partment from him. It is a passing
coincidence that the French Embassa
dor, the Austrian Minister and the
Spanish Minister are more closely asso
ciated together than any other diplo
mats in the case.
FOUGHT OUT
EIGHT ROUNDS
Mike McCormick and Joe Kane
Before the Excelsior
Club.
It Was a Draw, Both the Contestants
Being Exhausted at the
End.
Mike McCormick of Pennsylvania and
Joe Kane of the Excelsior Athletic Club
fought an eight-round draw last night in
the Excelsior Club rooms on the corn*) â¢
of Folsom and Eighth streets. It was a
lively bout from start to finish, and had
there been two rounds more it is certain
that one of the contestants would have
"gone out." Both of^ them were weak
when the gong sounded the end of the
eighth round and Jimmy Lawler, who act
ed as referee, properly decided the fight
a draw. Kane made a good showing, con
sidering the fact that he had only beer
training for four days, having been se
lected to take the place of Pat Lynch,
who was to have met McCormick. Lynch
was taken sick about a week ago and
Kane was substituted.
McCormick started to rush things in the
first round, but a stiff right punch on the
mouth caused him to cool down. He
found before the end of the round that
Kane was not partial to blows over the
kidneys. From that time on to the end
of the contest he kept up a continual
hammering over Kane's kidneys.
Kane, on the other hand, was looking
to plant a knockout blow on McCormick's
jaw with his right. He landed time and
again, but did not have steam enoi gh be
\hind the blows to floor McCormick. One
round was a repetition of the preceding
one, but the work told on both contes
tants. When they squared off at the be
ginning of the eighth round they were
both in bad condition, and had either of
them gone down there would have been
a different ending to the contest.
J. J. Hourigan acted as master of cere
monies, and Harry F. McGurren as offi
cial timekeeper.
Preceding the "main event" there were
several friendly bouts between Jimmy
Lawler and Jack Dalle, Jim Webster and
Jack King. Jack Gorman and Charles
Rapp, Tom Devine and Willie Otts; Jack
Sullivan and Billy Lawler. Joe Hansen
sang several songs, and Louis Solomon
gave an exhibition of his abilities as a
contortionist.

tion of England have their lives in

WAITING UPON
THE PRESIDENT
Republican Congressmen
Agree to Give Him
Until Monday.
There Has Been a Definite
Understanding Reached
All Around.
The End cf It All Will Be the
Freedom of the Suffering
Cubans.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, March 30.â The Re
publicans of the House who are ag
gressively in favor of prompt and ener
getic action in the Cuban matter and
who met last night in conference held
another meeting after the House ad
journed to-night. At last night's meet
ing forty-six members were present.
To-night they were re-enforced by sixty
nine, making a total of 115. This con
stitutes considerably more than a ma
jority of the Republicans of the House
and the members present to-night said
that it by no means represents the full
strength of those who will be satisfied
with nothing short of complete inde
pendence of Cuba. Many of the radi
cals favor armed intervention, and a
few, like Representative March of Illi
nois, believe the blowing up of the
Alaine is a casus belli.
The speeches at to-night's meeting,
While vigorous and yielding nothing.
were nevertheless in favor of giving
the President an opportunity to iracure
his policy and of completing the nego
tiations in which he is now engaged.
Many of the leaders in the movement,
including Mr. Hopkins of Illinois, Mr.
Hull of lowa, Mr. Tawney of Minnesota,
Mr. Bromwell of Ohio, Mr. Hepburn of
lowa and W. A. Smith of Michigan, saw
the President to-day and all lie asked
was a brief delay. Action hy Con
gress before the pending negotiations
are completed, he told them, would em
barrass him and might result in a com
plete rupture.
Mr. Hull and Mr. Bromwell and oth
ers explained the situation to the con
ference. They counseled acquiescence
in the President's desires. A rupture
with the administration was greatly to
be deplored and should, they argued,
only occur as a last resort. They in
formed the conference that the Presi
dent had said that the negotiations j
now in progress would either fail or be i
successful by the end of the week. He !
believed they would be successful. He !
did not indicate their nature, they said,
and they pointed out that it would be
manifestly ruinous for the details to be â 
made public at this time. They said
further that the President informed
them that he would, in the event of !
the failure of the negotiations, place
the whole subject before Congress and
share with it the responsibility for
what might follow.
Adams of Pennsylvania, the ranking
member of the Foreign Affairs Commit
tee in the absence of Hitt, explained j
that the sentiment of the committee j
was strongly against further delay al- i
though he himself was a conservative. ;
But he said the committee were will- '
ing to defer to the wishes of the Presl- i
dent and no action would be taken at i
the meeting to-morrow. On Monday, j
however, if a solution had not been pre
viously reached, action would be had.
All the members present professed
ignorance of the detail^ of the Presi
dent's plans and negotiations, although
several said the President assured them
that If successful they would, he
thought, be satisfied.
While these different reports were
made to the conference, they were un
official, and the conference decided at
last to appoint a committee of eleven
to wait upon the President to-morrow
and explain their views of the situa
tion, the committee to report at a
meeting to be held to-morrow night.
The committee appointed consisted of
the following: Messrs Hopkins and
Lorimer of Illinois, Joy of Missouri.
Sulloway of New Hampshire, Cooper of
Wisconsin, Arnold of Pennsylvania,
Mercer of Nebraska, Knox of Massa
chusetts, Faris of Indiana, Hager of
lowa and Smith of Michigan.

HAVE SELF-GOVERNMENT
Governor Brady Declares the Terri
tory Is Not Granted Its Just
Consideration.
SEATTLE, March 30.â Governor John
G. Brady, of Alaska, who arrived in this
city this morning, will depart to-morrow
for New York and go thence to Washing
ton. There he will labor with members
of Congress in the effort to obtain what
ho considers just and equitable laws for
Alaska. The Governor expressed him
self to-night in terse language. Said he:
"The principle of local self-government
js violated in the case of Alaska. The
pÂ«;ople of that territory have no voice
whatever in the construction of laws that
are to govern them. The cities are denied
the right to form municipal corporations
for the purpose of governing themselves.
Laws are framed by men who have never
stt foot in Alaska, and who are utterly
unfamiliar with conditions there. The
people of the United States should know
that Alaska is now being settled by men
from everj' State in the Unionâ by a
hardy, intelligent, law-abiding and self
reliant element of the common people.
For these people due consideration should
be paid to gain their wishes in the meet
ing of the laws through which they are
to bo governed."
SENATORS
WAIT FOR
McKINLEY
Nothing Done Yesterday
With the Resolutions
of Tuesday.
The President Has Given Assur
ances Here, Too, That the
Independence of Cuba
Will Be Secured.
WASHINGTON, March 30.â The Sen
ate Committee on Foreign Relations
held two sessions to-day and adjourned
a few minutes before 5 o'clock without
reaching any agreement. Commander
Bradford of the Bureau of Equipment
was before the committee for several
hours more, giving expert testimony
as to the relative strength of the navies
of the United States and Spain, and
also advocating the purchase of the is
land of St. Thomas of the Danish West
Indies as a naval station.
The committee, as a result of its
session, agreed to postpone the comple
tion of the committee's work on the Cu
ban situation for a few days, in order
to afford time to the President to con
tinue his diplomatic negotiations with
the Spanish authorities. This conces
sion was the result of a request made
directly to members of the committee
by the President and it was granted by
the entire committee, without any mur
mur or dissent.
Previous to this action on the part of
the committee, the President had been
frankly informed that neither the com
mittee nor the Senate would be dis
posed to acquiesce in any agreement
for an armistice. This opposition is
understood to have been made clear on
behalf of the joint Republican and
Democratic steering committees of the
Senate, and It is understood to have
been met by the President with the re-
sponse that this Government would not
press the matter.
The President freely admitted to all
visiting Senators that the negotiations
with Spain were rapidly approaching a
crisis, and said he felt quite confident
that a conclusion would be reached b>
Friday night at the latest. He asked j
that in view of this fact no action be j
taken by either house until after that
time, or until the present negotiations
could be brought to a close.
The actual proceedings of the com
mittee to-day consisted of a general ex
change of views concernir- the situ
ation and the proper course to be pur
sued by the committee of the reference
of the various Cuban resolutions to a
sub-committee; of the reading of part
of the testimony of the Maine Court
of Inquiry, and of the examination of
Commander Bradford, chief of the Bu
reau of Equipment. There is a reso
lution pending before the committee
providing for the opening of negotia
tions for the acquisition of the Island
of St. Thomas, in the West Indies, from
Denmark, and the disposition of the
committee, after hearing Mr. Bradford,
seemed favorable to early affirmative
action upon it.
The committee was authorized to oifc
during the session of the Senate and
will meet again to-morrow.
WOLCOTT SCORES
SECRETARY GAGE
Says an Insulting Letter Was
Sent to a Senate Com
mittee.
Flippant Reply to a Request for an
Opinion as to a Postal Savings
Bank.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, March 30.
.In the Senate to-day Mr. Wolcott of
Colorado, chairman of the Committee on
Postofflces and Postroads, made a re
markable and caustic arraignment of the
Secretary of the Treasury, on account of
the Secretary's flippant treatment of a
request made by Mr. Wolcott's com
mittee.
Mr. Wolcott said that on March 10 the
Committee on Postofflces and Postroads
had asked the Secretary of the Treasury
for his opinion on a postal savings bank
system. A similar communication had
been sent to the Postmaster-General, and
a courteous and extended reply in due time
had been received. The views of the
Secretary of the Treasury upon the ques
tion were particularly desired by the
committee, as it was expected that some
opinions of value would be presented.
After waiting for an unusual time the
committee, Mr. Wolcott said, had received
the Secretary's reply.
"I have to report to the Senate," said
he, "that the reply was of such a nature

LITTLE DAMAGE TO CROPS.
Santa Clara Valley Has Suffered but
Slightly From Frost.
BAN JOSE, March 30. â "A personal In
spection of the present condition of the
Santa Clara Valley crops shows much
less damage than earlier reports led peo
ple to believe had been inflicted by the
frost," said C. M. Wooster to-day. "The
raised lands approaching the eastern
foothills have not been injured by the
frost. This is true of a large extent of
the districts around and east of Berry
essa. Some apricots and early peaches
have been touched, but not destroyed.
The lower lands, particularly along thÂ«
old creek courses, are more seriously af â¢â¢
fected as regards apricots and peaches,
but the frost damage to prunes is not
very serious. The large fruit sections on
the west side, mostly with slight eleva
tions, are damaged very little, if any.
The Saratoga and Los Gatos region shows
but little evidence of injury. Grain and
hay is suffering some from the lack of
rain, but this is not beyond redemption,
provided we have the usual April rains.
"While the frost has done serious harm
in some parts of the valley, the damage,
compared with the grÂ«u volume of the
output, will, in my judgment, be small,
and principally confined to early peaches
and apricots in the lower lands. Noth
ing at present indicates that the volume
of fruit for the .valley will be less than
the average, inasmuch as" many young
orchards are coming into bearing this
year that have not heretofore been pro
ductive." - -. :â

AGED GENERAL CLAY
BESIEGED BY WOMEN.
Wish to Marry Him as Soon as He
Is Divorced From His
Child-Wife.
WHITEHALL, Ky., March 30.â Since
the publication of the report that General
Cassius Marcellus Clay proposed to pro
cure a divorce from his child wife, but
that he still felt the need of a spouse to
share his magnificent home, he has re
ceived hundreds of offers from women
who are willing- to marry him, though he
has but a life interest in an estate and
350 a month pension. Thirty-one letters
came yesterday, this being 1 only a sample
mail. Some of them were from widows,
some from middle-aged women and some
from young girls. A few inclosed their
photographs, and nearly all were anxious
to visit Whitehall at once. All were
willing- to marry him as soon as he could
get a divorce.
EPIDEMIC OF SPINAL
MENINGITIS AT TACOMA.
Physicians Say It Is Due to Colds,
Followed by Intense
Worrying.
TAC.OMA, March 30.â An epidemic of
spinal meningitis is beginning to be
feared on Puget Sound. It cannot result
from any lack of sanitary precautions,
but rather through the worrying of
scores of people who have relatives and
friends in Alaska. Doctors here say that
taking cold, followed by Intense worry
ing, is sufficient to cause Inflammation at
the base of the brain, producing the
dread disease. During March there have
been nine deaths from meningitis, most of
them occurring within a few days.
August J. Brummer, ex-Chief of the Ta
coma Fire Department and well known
to San Francisco insurance men, died of
meningitis yesterday after suffering ter

BATTLES WITH
GALE AND SEA
Perilous Voyage of the
Little Schooner
Morrill.
Encounters Hurricane Winds
While Returning From
Alaska.
Blown Nearly Seven Hundred Miles
Out of Her Course In Ten
Days.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
SEATTLE, March 30.â The trim little
schooner M. M. Morrill arrived in port
this afternoon after battling with ter
rible gales for ten days, during which
she was blown nearly 700 miles out of
her course. She took twenty gold
hunters to Yakutat Bay, whence they
hoped to reach the Yukon country by
the newly discovered route. As Cap
tain Grant and the members of the
crew describe the Morrill's adventures
with the hurricane that raged in Feb
ruary in northern waters, it is little
short of wonderful that she brought
her people back to tell of it.
The schooner, however, is stiff and
staunch. For three days she drifted
before the mighty winds that blew from
the south and west. Lite was made
miserable enough for those on board by
the Morrill's preliminary brush with a
stiff wind off the straits, for many of
her passengers had never before em
barked on a long sea voyage. But
compared with the weather encountered
later tlie gales off the straits anrl from
there north to Dixon Entrance were but
summer zephyrs.
J. S. Green, who owns the schooner,
says that when he left Yakutat the
wenther in Disenchantment Bay waw
delightful. Said he:
"There had been some small amount
of ice at the mouth of the bay and some
of the schooners found It necessary to
disembark their passengers at Yaku
tat. We went clear to the headwaters
of the bay and found navigation open
in good shape. The party that went
north on the Morrill Is among the ear
liest to get over the route to the Alsek
River. Travel over the pass is all right.
People are going and coming contin
ually. At Yakutat there are 200 peo
ple preparing to make the start for the
Interior." ,
Mr. Green reports that the brlgantine
Blakeley had arrived safely at Yakutat
berore he left.
FATAL ACCIDENT
ON THE SOLANO
Body of an Old Gentleman
Found on the Ferry
boat's Car Tracks.
Supposed Resident of Oakland Decap
itated While Crossing at
Port Costa.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ANTIOCH, March 30.â An old gentle
man was killed on the ferryboat Solano at
Port Costa last evening. No one saw the
accident, and no one seems to know how
It occurred. When found the body was
lying across one of the numerous tracks
on the ferry, with one foot crushed and
the head entirely severed.
The victim was a passenger on the No.
2 Sacramento train, which arrlveu at
Port Costa at 7:20 o'clock. He had a
conductor's check in his pocket, punched
for Oakland or San Francisco. Coroner
Curry had the body removed to the
Morgue at Martinez. It has not been
Identified. The old gentleman was about
60 years of age, well dressed in black di
agonal trousers and vest, blue frock coat,
black overcoat, calico shirt, gray under
clothing, laced shoes and black Fedora
hat. There was nothing upon the body
by which it could be identified, except
that the shirt was marked "No. 2" on the
flap, a peculiar marking for a shirt. Be
sides the conductor's check a couple of
Oakland street car transfer checks were
found In a pocket, together with a new
purse, containing $6 65. It is supposed
that he was a resident of Oakland.
CARRIES FOURTEEN
SHOT IN HIS BRAIN.
Youthful Victim of an Accident
Proves His Physician a False
Prophet.
GRTDL,EY, March 30.â A case which is
a surprise to the physicians and a grati
fication to anxious parents is that of
eight-year-old Willie Martin. On March
B Willie and his brother observed a hawk
sailing above their father's barn on the
farm near Gridley, and they determined
to rid the place of him. The brother went
Into the house and got a shotgun. As he
came out the door the gun was discharg
ed, and Willie, who stood about fifteen
feet distant, received the charge of No. 5
shot in the face and head.
Fourteen of the shot penetrated tb';
boy's skull and the doctors probed deep
Into his brain. He was given up to die,
but with a perverseness quite astonishing
he refused to realize the doctor's prophe
cies, and now he is running about his
home with the other children of the fam
ily, apparently in no way the worse for
the fact that he carries fourteen shot in
his brain.

COLLISION
AT FRENCH
CAMP DEPOT
Fresno Flyer Crashes Into
an Engine Upon a
Sidetrack.
Carelessness of a Fireman in
Leaving a Switch Open Respon
sible for the Loss of
a Life.
STOCKTON, March 30.â The "Fresno
flyer," due at French Camp station,
four and a half miles above here, at
4:10 o'clock, was wrecked this after
noon. William Huffman, the fireman,
lost his life and a number of trainmen
and passengers were injured. The dis
aster was the result of gross careless
ness. The train was made up of a first
class coach and a smoker, and the first
exclamation of one gazing on the mass
of wreckage is that it is remarkable
that no more lives were forfeited in
the catastrophe.
This afternoon a large freight engine
in charge of Engineer William Hat
field and Fireman R. P. Stevens started
from Tracy with orders to allow the
flyer to pass at French Camp. The run
was made on time- and the locomotive
backed upon a siding, the switch be
ing thrown by Fireman Stevens, who,
according to the best information ob
tainable, went down the embankment
to attend to something and failed to
close the switch. Engineer Hatfield
ran the engine back a hundred yards
and was oiling it, when the whistle of
the flyer soundod. As no flag was out
at the station the engineer came down
under full headway.
As the train neared the switch, Ste
vens ran up, evidently remembering his
neglect, but he was too late. Engineer
Henry Hahn saw the open switch sig
nal when nearly upon it. In despera
tion he threw all the emergency brakes,
but the train crashed into the big
freight locomotive with a report like
an artillery volley, and fire, steam and
smoke enveloped the scene.
People who rushed to the wreck be
held an appalling sight. The passen
ger engine had been literally torn to
pieces and the first-class coach had
rolled down the embankment, lying on
its side. The yells and curses of the
imprisoned passengers seemed to indi
cate great loss of life. Engineer Hahn
fell from his cab and staggered over
the grass. William Huffman, the young
fireman, was caught between the ten
der and the fire box and instantly killed.
It was some time before his remains
were extricated. Conductor Lev! Bardo
and Brakeman Ed Hundley were
bruised and injured, but with the help
of people from the County Hospital
near by they set bravely at work rescu
ing the passengers. They climbed
upon the coach and began pulling wo
men and children out of the windows.
In the wrecked coach w r ere about
twenty people, but, strange to relate,
REV. J. AVERY SHEPHERD DEAD.
Passing of the Divine Who Opened the First Confed
erate Congress With Prayer.
SANTA ROSA, March 30.â Rev. J. Avery Shepherd, the oldest Episcopal
minister In California and one of the best-known churchmen on the Pa
cific Coast, died at his home in this city this afternoon.
Dr.. Shepherd was born in Vermont. When quite young he moved with
his father to Brazil, but after spending a few years in that country he re
turned to his native land and matriculated at Middlebury College, Ver
mont. Four years later he graduated from this institution, and at the
request of Bishop Green of Mississippi he shortly afterward went to that
State and took charge of St. Andrews College at Jackson, where he re
mained for several years. While there he married Miss Evelyn Turner of
Baltimore, who was Justly distinguished for her many accomplishment* and
charming manners.
After leaving Mississippi Dr. Shepherd went to Kentucky and at Louis
ville he was ordained a priest of the church by Bishop Smith. From Ken
tucky he and his wife moved to North Carolina, and nine years later they
came to California shortly after the appointment of the Right Rev. Wil
liam I. Kip a Bishop, arriving here in 1854, eight months after that well
known churchman. He opened a young ladies' school in San Francisco
and educated many of the now prominent matrons of that city, afterward
returning East and conducting a ladles' college near Montgomery, Ala.
The war breaking out, the school was closed.
Montgomery being the first capital of the Confederacy. Dr. Shepherd
opened the first session of the Confederate Congress with prayer, but did
not afterward officiate at the meeting, although it has been Incorrectly stat
ed that he was thÂ« regular chaplain of that organization.
Twenty years ago he came to Santa Rosa, and for many years had
charge of this parish. For several years past he has lived in retirement.

RUNAWAY HORSES.
Napa Young Man Badly Injured on
a Ranch Near the

NAPA, March 30.â Joseph Henry, a well
known young man of this city, met with
an accident to-day at the Cutting Pack
ing Company's ranch west of Napa, in
which he sustained a compound fracture
of the right leg. Henry had hitched four
horses to a heavy roller on the hillside
and then proceeded to take his seat, when
the dashboard gave way and he fell in

none were killed. Among the several
women and children not a limb was
broken, but many were cut and bruised.
Those who are injured were: Fred
A. Grim, a traveling man from Ohio,
cut by glass; J. A. Reynolds, adjuster
for the Royal Insurance Company, stu
tioned at San Francisco, hurt in the
back; A. C. Burnett, fireman on the
steamship Mary Garratt, running be
tween Stockton and San Francisco, dis
located shoulder. Engineer H. C.
Hahn of the Fresno flier train, with
whom young Huffman was running-,
was severely cut in the right sid?, but
not seriously injured. C. Cleveland, the
Wells-Fargo messenger on the flier,
was slightly hurt.
As soon as possible an engine and
coach from the Stockton yards went
out to bring in the dead and injured.
So quickly was this done by the rail
road people that it was impossible to
get passenger lists.
The freight locomotive, struck head
on, was knocked 200 feet, its front torn
out and the tender and fire box mixed.
Pieces of wreckage from the passenger
engine were strewed for a distance of
a hundred yards. Boilers, tanks, ten
der and cab were one jumbled mass.
The smoker, which was the second car
in the train, left the track, but stayed
on the grade. The crew of this train
included Conductor I>vl Bardo, Engi
neer William Hahn. Fireman Huffman,
Baggageman Charles Cleveland and
Brakeman Ed Hundley.
While waiting the arrival of help,
young Stevens, who threw the switch,
lay groveling in the sand, moaning over
his unfortunate act. He declared the
company at fault, as he had been kept
on the road forty-eight hours with no
sleep and was half crazed on the run
toward Stockton. Stevens is the son
of wealthy parents, who lately got his
promise to quit railroading, and this
was to have been one of his last trips.
C. H. Huffman, father of the de
ceased fireman, is the originator of the
Crocker-Huffman canal enterprise of
Merced County, where he owned vast
tracts of land for many years. A few
years ago when his son Will expressed
a desire to learn railroading the father
urged him to turn his attention to some
other business and offered him any
necessary capital to engage in any en
terprise which he might choose, and it
is said he offered the young man $15,000
in cash to give up railroading, but the
fireman determined to continue in his
calling that was so full of interest to
him. He was twenty-three years of
age and generally well thought of.
Among his young associates he was a
favorite and his death is deeply re
gretted here.

distance before they stopped. One horse
broke its leg and had to be shot. The
flesh on the entire length of Henry's right
leg was torn into threads. Medical aid
was summoned and Henry was removed
to the County Infirmary. He is a son of
S. P. Henry, a prominent citizen of this
place.

FRESNO, March 31.â
At midnight the principal
posse returned, to Merced from
the hunt for the Cross Creek
bandits. Eight or ten men are
still on the trail. Sheriff Cun
ningham believes the men be
ing chased are the robbers.
They are thought to be head
ing for Raymond.
FRESNO March 80.â Railroad De
tectives Meade and Crowley and
Deputy Sheriffs Peck and Timmlns re
turned to this city on the 5:20 train this
evening from Merced, whither they
went last night on a special engine
when it was r*" >rted that the Cross
Creek train robbers had been surround
ed at a point near Indian Gulch. It
was found this morning that the rob
bers were not surrounded, but had
made good their escape before the
gathering of the officers in the vicinity
where they were supposed to be hiding.
The officers were divided against them
selves as to whether the men supposed
to be the robbers were actually bandits,
and while a posse of twenty officers is
still In pursuit of the men in question
Meade's men have given up that clew
and expect to strike a new lead.
Peck and Timmins are strongly of the
opinion that Bandit Cliff Regan led the
outlaws, and they are satisfied that one
of the men who had the rig that was
recovered was jrtegan. The proprietor
of the store at which the men bought
|18 worth of provisions and a hat de
scribed the man who did the buying
and the description given fitted Regan
in every particular. He -as then
shown a picture of the Madera County
outlaw and as soon as he set eyes on
It he identified it as that of Reeran.
The local officers are thoroughly con
vinced that the man at the store was
Cliff Regan but the only question with
them is whether Cliff Regan committed
the train robbery, or whether he was
merely making his way to more Becure
fastnesses, believing his position too
near here dangerous while so many of
ficers are scouring the country for the
train robbers.
Another reason why the men should
be wary of the officers was the fact that
the rig'whlfh they had was stolen from
J. C. Anderson at Bates on February
28. The rig \va* thoroughly overhauled.
Nothing that would connect the occu
pants in any degree with the Cross
Creek robbery was found.
The officers who surrounded the sec
tion of the country where they thought
the robbers were corraled could find no
trace of them this morning. It is now
believed that the men, from their point
of vantage, saw the officers tracking
them, and, abandoning their buggy,
provisions and blankets, struck out
through the ridge leading to the foot
hills. Parts of the ridge are thickly
covered by undergrowth, but the men
were tracked this morning to a place
where the base of the ridge consists of
rock, and there the trail was lost.
Sheriff Tom Cunningham, the veteran
peace officer and criminal hunter of San
Joaquln County, is now with the posse
following the robbers. Sheriff War
field of Merced and Sheriff Prouty of
Mariposa are also relentless in the
hunt, while a number of constables and
Deputy Sheriffs are on the trail of the
men.
Detective Crowley does not believe
Regan had anything to do with the
Cross Creek robbery, while other of
ficers think differently. Crowley, after
talking for three minutes to the Indian
Gulch storekeeper, said there was noth
ing in hunting those men and wanted
to return at once. Meade was of dif
ferent opinion.
It is not thought likely now that the
robbers will be caught for several days.

When Fremont followed the Mexicans
south he left Aram in command at Santa
Clara Mission to protect the settlers.
Later Aram went to Monterey and helped
to construct a fort. In 1849 he returned
to this county with his family, and he has
resided here ever since.
Captain Aram was a member of the
first State Constitutional Convention and
a member of the first Legislature which
met in this city in 1849. He established
the first nursery in Santa Clara County.
He always took an active interest in poli

SITKA HAS A
MINING BOOM
OF HER OWN
Quartz Assaying Nine Hundred
Dollars to the Ton Said to
Have Been Struck.
JUNEAU, Alaska, March 26 (by Steamship Cottage City to Seat
tle, March 30) -Sitka, the sleepy capital of Alaska, has a sensation.
Some of her people are becoming excited and have Monte Cristo dreams.
According to the latest reports which have reached here from Sitka a
semi-quartz semi-placer formation of slate and di >rite found in "Pauda
Basin, beyond Saw Mill Creek, back of what is known as Billy's Ba
sin," has been assayed and found to run from $250 to $900 a ton. The
formation is a sort of pebble, which is said to have come off glaciers.
Ex-Surveyor-General Willey of California, a son-in-law of ex-Collector
Moore of the port of New York, and a few others are among the prin
cipal owners of the property, which has been bonded. There is somÂ«
quartz in the gravel. General Willey is over at Sitka now and has been
there for some time and so has Mr. Moore.
The news was brought to Juneau late to-night by C. S. Johnson,
Judge of the United States District Court of Alaska, who confirms the
report of the richness of the ground; by J. M. Davidson from Sitka and
by a Mr. Shelly of Portland, Or., who carries considerable reading mat
ter about it for a Portland newspaper. Mr. Shelly vehemently denies
that it is a stock scheme.
A packer from Billy's Basin, who came over on the ship to-night to
Join the march to the Klondike, says that assays of the gravel have
run as high as $600 to the ton. It is impossible here to-night to get
a more detailed description of the character of the gravel or of the lo
cality.
The same locality was prospected two or three years ago and as
says made, the highest of which is said to have run $24. Pacific
Coast newspapers published this at the time. It was known as the
Gold Lake District, but very little has ever been done to develop it. It
is about thirteen miles from Sitka. The capital has always been be
lieved to be surrounded by a rich mineral district. Any kind of gravel
or ore which runs from $250 to $900, showing an average of $450, buriea
the Klondike out of sight, hence the people of the capital are begin
ning to dream that 'Sitka will become more than a synonym for Klon
dike and to spread its fame. Reports more in detail are expected on
the next boat in about two weeks.
J. M. Davidson is recently from Siskiyou County, Cal. He said in
addition:
"Do not give me as authority for this. I don't know anything about
It. Some over at Sitka think it is a great thing and some take no
stock in it I don't want my friends in California to get excited by
anything from me about this." HAL HOFFMAN.

Senator Enns for many years was a
prominent politician in San Francisco
and received many honors from dif
ferent political parties. In 1880 he was
elected by the Workingmen's party to
represent the Thirteenth District of San
Francisco in the State Senate. From
1883 to 1887 he served under Governor
Stoneman as Labor Commissioner, and
it was at the time of his appointment
to this office that a great protest went
up, his opponents claiming that office
was created especially for his benefit.
For a number of years he was prose

circles.
Mr. Enos came to California in the
early fifties from Fulton County, New

Rea's San Jose "Gang"
Springs a Unique
Innovation.
Insurance Policies Taken Out
to Gain the Support of
Agents.
Thirty Thousand Dollar Risk on a
Building the City Does Not
Yet Own.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, March 30.â Mystery has
hitherto surrounded the motive which
led the City Council at a recent meet
ing to place $30,000 worth of insurance
on the uncompleted High School build
ing at the same time that $40,000 worth
of insurance on the City Hall was re
newed. The mystery has now been dis
sipated. The facts that explain it
make up another illustration of how
the "gang" fraudulently utilizes the
funds of the tax-payers to intrench
itself in office.
At the time the matter of insuring
the High School building, which is now
in the course of construction under the
contract awarded to P. J, Byron, was
up for consideration in the Council
Mayor Koch objected to this expense
on the ground that the city had no in
terest in the structure until it was
turned over to the municipality after
it was completed by the contractor.
Despite his protest the motion to place
this insurance was carried.
Contractor Byron, in an Interview
with The Call correspondent, expressed
himself in accord with the view of the
Mayor. He said further that he had
$8000 worth of insurance on the build
ing, and would keep that amount on it
until he had completed his contract and
had turned the property over to the
city and it had been formally accepted
by the Council. Until that time he con
sidered the risks of fire and other dan
gers were entirely his. He did not in
sure for more, he said, because he
thought $8000 would cover any damage
that would be likely to occur.
Why, then, was this insurance placed
when there was absolutely no necessity
for it? And why were hundreds of
dollars of the cit s funds thus wasted?
Thes3 are questions that tbu tax-payers
have asked and are still asking. Here
is the answer:
The "gang" realized that it was go
ing to have one of the hardest battles
to fight in the coming city election that
it had ever been engaged in, and that
one of the strongest factors in the con
test would be the real-estate men,
many of whom act as agents of various
insurance companies. By giving them
a little sop in the shape of some of this
insurance, as well as part of the re-in
surance on the City Hall, it was hoped
to keep them in line for the "gang"
ticket.
J. D. Miner, the "gang" candidate for
Councilman at Large, was selected to
peddle out at least part of this insur
ance. He went from one agent to an
other, and made a deliberate proposi
tion to "swap" insurance policies for
votes and Influence in behalf of the
"gang" ticket, which is masquerading
under the name of the People's Muni
cipal ticket. To the credit of the real
estate men. most of whom realize thor
oughly that their best interests lie in
the defeat of the "gang," Mr. Miner
was not in all cases successful, but he
kept to his task until he had no more
policies to peddle.
By the part that Mr. Miner took in
this matter he not only made himself
a party indirectly to the robbery of the
people, but he made himself liable to
punishment under the purity of elec
tions law. He was virtually spending
the money wrongfully taken from the
city treasury to further his election on
the 11th of April. Mr. Miner Is the boss
i candidate, who is running in opposition
to J. P. Jarman, whom "Jim" Rea is
charged with having slandered and
damaged to the amount of $50,000.

There have lately been so many com
plaints against the Sanitary Reduction
Works that a petition Is now In circula
tion asking the Board of Supervisors to
compel the company to do something to
prevent the stench from polluting the
neighborhood.
Scavengers complain they axÂ« charged
unlawful prices for having their garbage
burned, and there are evidences that
there will soon be a battle between them
and the sanitary company.
"When the wind is not blowing out In
the vicinity of the works," said A- J.
Crawford yesterday, "the stench Is very
bad, being something like the smell of
burning rubber and old leather. There la
a general complaint in the neighborhood
that the works are run in such a way as
to be a detriment to the health of the
people and do great damage to property."
There will be a meeting of private gar
bage gatherers and owners of garbaga
drays to-morrow for the purpose of devis
ing ways and means to defeat the pro
posed ordinance that compels all garbaga
dealers to buy a special wagon, which Is
owned by the Sanitary Reduction Work*
and covered by divers patents. Those
making the fight say that agents of tha
company are good underground politi
cians, and that they have mastered tha
art of handling Boards of Supervisors and
others in such a way as to get laws
passed that benefit their company. It is
probable that the circulation of the peti
tion now being advocated in the Mission
Is the signal for the beginning of a war
that will last for some time, for It is a
fight for survivorship on the part or pri
vate contractors.

V|CL
ft is undeniable that then are men irAÂ»<
do not live lives that are best for them.
They live too rapidly altogether. Then
nature comes to the fare and denies to them
the great privileges that she allows toothers .
who live more discreetly. She takes away
the gifts that are most prized by men.
When she has done that the man usually
despairs of ever getting back his former
power. But it is not only possible, but it
has been done in many thousands of In-
stances. The great thing to be done first of
all is to stop the losses â the drains â that Â»
are making the system still weaker. This is
done by the great "Hudyan" treatment in a
week, and then complete recuperation rapidly
follows in this way :
A fast and reckless life led.
Vitality all but gone.
Hope vanishing.
The drains are stopped.
Full vigor and health return.
"Hudyan" can be depended on to do this.
In the event of your having led a life that
i has weakened you. it is wise to lose no time,
but to seek relief at once. It is certain to
come, and you will become a vigorous and a
j healthy man again, as it is that you are a
! weakling now. Write and ask for free cir-
culars telling you what "Hudyan" has dona
for 20,000 men in this land of ours. Then
if you have blood taint of any nature ask for
! "30-day blood cure" testimonials. They are
free, too, and so is medical advice. Mo one
need suffer from the effects of blood poison,
for "30-day cure" is as efficient in the ter-
tiary as in ihe primary or secondary stages.
ft cures them all completely. Is there any-
thing else that troubles you ? If so write

A FOND FAREWELL
Plain Facts Showing How the
San Jose Mercury's Falsi
fication Artist Digged
a Pit and Fell
Therein.
To enter into a lengthy controversy with the San Jose
Mercury would be to ascribe to that sheet a dignity It never
possessed and an influence it can never hope to attain. Yet
there seems occasion for reply to its charge that The Call
is striving to injure the Santa Clara Valley to show the
groundlessnes of the accusation and make a display of the
stupidity of the Mercury- A sheet so practiced in the arts
of falsehood might naturally be expected to do its lying
gracefully. But even in its lies the Mercury blunders, ex
posing its animus and making a wanton and unpleasant ex
hibition of its guile.
That The Call published a telegram relative to frost in
the Santa Clara Valley is true. That it changed the tele
gram so as to make the prospect? of the valley seem worse
than the correspondent set forth is the opposite of true, as
may be observed by a glance at the affidavit of Mr. Cowles
and other evidence presented herewith. The only change
maÂ«r" in the process of editing was a modification of the
original statement. The ccrpy received from the Associated
Press and the reproduction of it in The Call and the Exam
iner render further explanation on this point a trespass on
the intelligence of readers. â¢
Even the dim Rea of light illuminating the Mercury
must realize that had the valley been visited by a severe
frost the news would have been of great importance, and
Interesting to the entire State. Had any item concerning
such a visitation been suppressed nothing tending to benefit
the valley would have resulted. As to the reliability uf

depend upon its correspondents. As a rule the Associated
Press is accurate, and it could have no object in wantonly
assailing any territory in which it gathers information. One
of its agents at San Jose is city editor of the Mercury, a
second on another local paper. If either of these gentlemen
happen to be off duty and their work fall to a temporary
substitute, the fact would not be known among the papers
receiving messages, and would be of no importance. The
work would be accepted as up to the usual standard of
veracity.
The person who forwarded the message which has sent
the Mercury into hysteria avows himself as Herbert A.
Yoell, and doubtless he is correct ir. this. But why was it
so grave an offense for the city papers to print that which
they supposed to be correct, and no offense for Yoell to give
it to them for the purpose erf being printed? He was on the
ground and the facts were within his reach. They were far
away, and forced to take his word. But as will be seen by
indubitable proof the Mercury had garbled the Yoell dis
patch, whether with or without his consent matters noth
ing. In either case it has lied elaborately and deliberately,
and furnished the tools wherewith it is branded.
An apology is due readers in general for devoting so
much space to so unwholesome a subject as the falling Mer
cury. Convicted as a falsifier, a garbler of telegrams, a
silly traducer, it shall not again be allowed by any excess of
mendacity to project itself into the notice of The Call.

TIME TO INVESTIGATE.
A Striking Example of Negligence
in Sewer Repairing on Morris
Avenue.
An example of negligence, or some
thing worse, in public work, may be
found on Morris avenue, a little thor
oughfare between Fifth and Sixth and
Bryant and- Brannan streets. A slx
teen-inch stone pipe sewer was laid
there in 18S9. Seven weeks ago it was
uncovered for repair and it has re
mained uncovered ever since. It is
eight inches higher In the middle than
at the point of beginning and as water
will nut run up hill the sewer is a fail
ure as a drainage canal. The joints of
the pipe bulge up and down so the
wreck resembles a snake partially un
coiled.
The spectacle was observed by The
Call's expert two weeks ago, but it was
deemed best to say nothing for a fort
night in order to ascertain if the Health
authorities would not intervene to pro
vide an c/utlet for the drainage. The
health authorities seem to be as inac
tive and indifferent as those who are
charged with the responsibility of
street repairs.
As an excuse for the neglect of the
sewer it is given out that the force of
men under the direction of theÂ» Street
Department is not adequate to per
form all the repairs demanded. Ac
cording to- the March payroll of the
Street Department there was quite an
army of employes in the field. On sew
ers there were eleven underground
men; ten windlass men; thirteen men
with horses ar.l carts; one flusher;
three men with horses and wagons;
one watchman, two cesspoc-1 men, seven
bricklayers, eipht hod carriers, sixteen
laborers and four foremen. This force
of eighty-six able-bodied men on the
sewers, working full time, as the pay
roll showy, ought to be able to do con
siderable work.
There is another battalion of men !
engaged on accepted streets. In this
column may be .found fourteen ram
mers, fifteen pavers, nineteen laborers,
one inspector, six foremen, two car
penters, nine men with horses and
carts, eleven men with double teams
and five clerks in the office. Here is
a respectable force of eighty-two men
who put in full time during the month
of March.
The reserve force, in addition to the
men above enumerated, may be classed
as follows: Sixteen deputies allowed :
by law, engineer at Fourth street i
bridge, two keepers at Fourth street I
bridge, one assistant keeper at the I
bridge, three keepers at the corporation !
yard, two assistant keepers at the j
yard, one keeper at the dumps and one
inspector at Alpine street sewer.
It would seem that this large force
which the taxpayers maintain should
be able to take care of the accepted ,
streets and keep such thoroughfares in
passable repair. The Call's inquiry dis-
Closes the fact there is yet an addi- i
tional or auxiliary force paraded under
the banner of the City Street Improve- ;
ment Company. This force is employed j
on the repair of .accepted streets. In i
some instances the bills rendered for!
patch work show that the patching !
costs more than would be required to !
put in new work, concrete and all.
On one job, the repair of Folsom
street from Third to Twentieth, fie City I
Street Improvement Company rendered j
a bill of $1995. Authorizations passed |
in favor of this company which amount 'â 
in the aggregate to $3285 are held up by
the Auditor.
The most remarkable chapter in the
history of street work scandal now
comes to light. It appears that the
City Street Improvement Company has
no contract, arrangement or authority
whatever, from any responsible source
which authorizes it to repair accepted
streets. The Call, under a misappre
hension, indirectly charged the Super
intendent of Streets, Mr. Ambrose, with
having entered into a private arrange
ment with contractors to do certain
work. The Superintendent distinctly
denies that he has made such private
arrangement. His deputies cannot pro
duce any contract, arrangement or
memoranda by which the City Street
Improvement Company is directed to
do the work of repairing accepted
streets. The clerks in the office of the
Board of Supervisors fail to find the
record of any Board or Street Commit
tee resolution authorizing any arrange
ment with the City Street Improve
ment Company to perform this work.
Mr. Ambrose says that the Street Com
mittee told his chief deputy to make
an arrangement with the City Street
Improvement Company for repairing
bitumen pavement.
Surely the Supervisors at the next
session of the board will inquire as to
whether any members of the Street
Committee hav^ arrogated to them
selves in this high-handed fashion the
power to let contracts contrary to law
and public interest.
Inquiry brings to lipht the further
fact that the Street Committee author
ized Dowling to do the Alamo square
work, for which bids were received at
the last sessio.. of the board, as Dowl-
Ing's original method of obtaining the
work was irregular. The Superinten
dent of Streets says distinctly that he
did not makr any arrangement what
ever with Inwling.
A wide field of investigation may now
be opened up by the Supervisors.
Somebody in the board is evidently as

MRS. EVA HARRISON.
BERKELEY, March 30.â The Halsey
murder wag the chief topic of comment
to-day in Berkeley, where both the mur
dered man and his slayer, as well as the
woman over whom the men had quar
reled, are well known.
According to Charles D. Haines, at
whose home Halsey met his tragic death,
the events which led up to the killing
make a pathetic story of a man who
risked and lost his life *ln an effort to
protect a woman from the evil influence
of former companions. Miss Eva Fenton,
the adopted daughter of Joseph Fenton,
a South Berkeleyan of some means, had
been neglected by her folks and aban
doned by a worthless husband whom she
had married just a year ago to-day. She
was without means of support for herself
and child when Mrs. Hair.es brought her
to her home and undertook to free her
from the influence of her former sur
roundings. In her new home she fre
quently received the attentions of Halsey.
who wa3 an old friend of the Haines
family. Rogers, the murderer, was aiso
an admirer of Mrs. Harrison. He had
called once ai the Haines residence, but
had been requested both by Hu.ir.os and
Mrs. Harrison to remain away. In addi
tion to this Halsey had warned him to
.stay away and to cease annoying Mrs.
Harrison under penalty of being
thrashed. When Halsey started in to ad
minister the' thrashing last night, Rogers
killed him.
Haines places no credence in Rogers'
plea that he killed Halsey in self-de
fense. Both Haines and his wife, who
were standing at the door when the shot
was fired, declare that Halsey rushed out
after Rogers with his hands in the air,
and that he had no weapon of any kind
in his hand. Haines declares that so far
as he knew Halsey was in the habit of
going entirely unarmed, and that he is
positive that the dead man never carried
a revolver. Halsey's brother-in-law
Robert Hunter, with whom he lives, cor
roborates this statement.
The finding of a razor in one of Hal
j sey's pockets, however, would seem to in
dicate- that he was not of so peaceable a
| disposition as some oZ his friends sup
: posed. The razor was nicked and rusty
j and did not appear to have been used for
1 some time. Moreover, Halsey had quar
reled with others and had separated from
his wife, from whom he received a divorce
; some time ago. He had quarreled, among j
I others, with James Overall, a D wight way- ;
! cigar dealer, and the latter obtained a j
i warrant for Halsey's arrest for battery, j
I although Halsey was never convicted on i
! the charge. A number of other Berkeleyans \
! declare that Halsey was of a quarrelsome j
! disposition and had at one time drawn a
| knife upon a man.
An autopsy was held this afternoon at
the Berkeley branch morgue on th*e body
of t"he murdered man. It was found that

The inquest will be held to-morrow even
ing at 8 o'clock.
OAKLAND. March 30.â Stacey Rodgers
was removed to the County Jail to-day,
but he declines to further discuss the
shooting of E. Halsey at Berkeley last
night. His brother Leo said to-night that
he is convinced his brother acted in self
defense and such will be his defense.
"There is no doubt whatever that Hal
sey threatened my brother," said Leo
Rodgers, "and he was naturally careful.
When Halsey was searched after his
death a razor was found in his pocket that
could not possibly have been used for
shaving, and it is but natural to presume
he carried it for other purposes. On a
former occasion I understand tiiat Halsey
used a knife in a disturbance, and this
f.K t was known to my brother. We have
engaged attorneys and shall contest the
proi â utlon every Ftep of the way."
Rodgers was very nervous to-day, and
has been told by his attorneys to say
nothing. Hf Is following their advice.
SUBSTITUTE CARRIERS.
Eleven More Are Appointed by
Postmaster Montague From the
Civil Service Eligibles.
Postmaster Montague yesterday made
appointments of substitute carriers from
the civil service list in addition to tha
forty substitute carriers already in ser
vice, the approach of the postofflce vaca
tion season, when many of the regular
carriers will take their much-needed rest,
and the fact that the number of substi
tute carriers was cut down from fifty to
forty some months ago, rendering this
increase in the force imperatively neces
sary. The following are the names of tha
appointees:
Henry S. Dunn. Edward V. Atkinson,
George A. Ross, Frank E. Wyse. William
R. Foster. William H. Houlihan, Fred A.
Forner, Otto H. yon Lowonfels, Charles
W. Dunn, James T. Walsh and William
H. Barry.
Substitutes receive SI per year and pro
rata the pay of the carriers whose places
they take. There are three grades of car
riers, drawing $600. JSOO and |MM per year
respectively.
The new appointees will go to work to
morrow.
The Eureka Society.
The Eureka Society for the Protection
of Children has started out with a new
life. Under the former management
there was not the greatest of harmony,
and the causes were many. On Tuesday
evening a new board of director! was
elected, and within the next few days the
society will become incorporated. At th*
meeting President R. A. Tuttle resigned
as trustee because his business demanded
more of his time and attention. The new
directors are Frank Murasky, J. M.
Waldteufel, L. A. Goldberg. Mrs. Gurnett,
Mr. and Mrs. Henry Templeman, J. W.
Walton, N. Fallek and V. Krolow. There
are several applications for the position
of secretary, and John Bovey. John Hoch.
E. L. Wadham and Fred Evans seem to
be about even for preference. These and
other officers will l>*> elected at a meeting
to be held this evening.

THAT BRITISH ALLIANCE.
Q N American is impressed by the spectacle of
/ A Mr. Davitt and other Irish members of the
British Parliament discussing a British al
liance with the United States in a tone of deep
seated hostility to . the Government of whose law
making body they are members. Their advice to this
country against an actual or implied alliance is some
what gratuitous, since there is no evidence that the
United States is seeking either war or alliance with
any European power.
The policy of this nation since 1820 has aimed at
a combination, at first commercial and finally mar
tial, with the nations of Central and South America.
As a rule alliances have not projected along the line
of common race, language or institutions. Eng
land has been at the head of two European alliances.
Spaniard, Russian, Austrian, Dutch, German and
Italian have joined under her leadership, and in the
great combinations against Louis XIV and Bona
parte neither common sympathies of race nor insti
tutions have cut any figure at all.
Russian autocracy was as eager to seek the help
of England on sea and land, as if that country were
also an absolute instead of a parliamentary govern
ment. Zones and hemispheres have interests in
common. It is possible that the slowly crystallizing
community of interests among the nations of the
Western Hemisphere will end finally in the presenta
tion of a united front from the Dominion line to the
Straits of Magellan on all questions wherein the in
terests of the New World and the Old may clash.
England would have a remote sympathy and a cer
tain right in such union by virtue of her Canadian
domain, but, as from a partnership in such alliance
she would gain more than she would give, her entry
could not be by her own will. There is no desire
among Americans for the misfortune and downfall
of Great Britain. As a colonizing nation she has
carried civilization by fleet and sword, and the other
European nations cannot claim a quality of mercy in
external policy superior to hers.
This country is desirous of avoiding European
complications. We have nothing to gain by them.
If we were put in straits by war our alliances would
be negotiated with our Western neighbors. If they
are wise they will respond. The bar to such response
would be a ftar of our becoming so strong that we
might enter upon a policy of absorption which would
destroy their autonomy, and it would be the policy
of Europe to incite that fear and play upon their
jealousy. As long as we are able to inspire confi
dence in our sense of justice and in our determina
tion to respect our own constitution we may count
upon the friendship of our American neighbors.
While it is not our business to strengthen Eng
land, it is also our duty to give no encouragement
to her enemies. The issues of peace and war are be
tween her and them, and concern us as individuals
only, as a nation not at all.
The position of Davitt and the Irish members of
Parliament is taken in revenge for seven centuries
of history', in which England has absorbed the auton
omy of Ireland on the plea that possession of that
island is necessary to her destiny and her defense.
Wherever in the world it is necessary for any pur
pose to impeach England the Irish indictment of her
policy is read. It is n warning to the United States
to avoid that form of arrogance which assumes that
strong nations may of right usurp the sovereignty
of the weak in order to their own defense.
Our proposition to annex Hawaii is getting dan
gerously near to that policy which is the great stain
on England's escutcheon, and in all times of trouble
her weakness and her worry.
Once the dispatch of a Spanish flotilla of torpedo
boats was scheduled to be regarded as an act of hos
tility. The flotilla was dispatched, and informatio:i
went forth that the dispatch of a second flotilla would
never be endured. The second one started without
delay, and the circumstance has been borne up under
with a fortitude most admirable. But of course Spain
will not be permitted to start any more flotillas â un
less she happen to feel like it.
It will be useless to try to check the Kansas im
petus toward the higher education now. After a
single term in an Eastern seminary Sallie Jane Smith
of that State emerged as S. Jeannye Smythe. Still,
Sallie must be an unusual girl. A person of ordin
ary intelligence would hardly have received this pol
ish in less than a whole year.
Writing from Dan-son a miner says the gold up
there is enough to set tenderfeet crazy. He is un
doubtedly right, and this has nothing to do with the
amount of gold either. The vaguest rumor is suffi
cient to start a stampede of people, who, unless they
can plead lunacy, have absolutely no excuse.
There seems to be no adequate punishment pre
scribed for the man who tore out his horse's tongue.
Hanging would be too good for him, and.even this
" interdicted,
THE "INCIDENT" OF THE MAINE.
UPON the graves of American seamen in Cuba
the tribute of a national grief withers under a
tropic sun. Within sound of the signal guns
of Spain, beneath the very shadow of her flag, the
bones of the gallant Maine sink daily deeper into the
slime of Havana harbor. Yet Americans are told
that the wrecking of this ship was an "incident."
They do not accept the verdict. They know it was
treachery without parallel; wholesale murder without
pretext. They resent the imputation that any na
tion â least of all that nation whose history is made
up of broken pledges, of rapine, of brutality unspeak
able â shall be able thus to add a new chapter to its
infamy and go unpunished and unrebuked.
It was the diabolic destruction of the Maine which
inflamed the United States with a wrath so righteous
as to 'be almost holy. It was the news that this craft
had been sent to the bottom of a friendly harbor
it had visited on a mission of peace which
caused Congress to make an appropriation for war
and the country to applaud Congress. But have the
statesmen at Washington forgotten the Maine? Do
they no longer remember that the sailor lads sent to
death represented the dignity of a great people?
There is talk now of a "free Cuba," and we have it
borne in upon U3 by every message from the Capitol
that the passing of the Maine was an "incident."
This is an unnatural and monstrous conclusion. The
passing of the Maine was a tragedy, an appeal to
patriotism, a call to arms. The truth cannot be
veiled by the talk of Cuba's wrongs, however great
and grievous these wrongs may be.
Civilization viewed with horror the outrages in
Armenia, but it did not interfere. For years the con
dition of affairs in Cuba has been known and de
plored, but the United States could find no excuse
for intervention such as the comity of nations would
have upheld. It was for the Cubans to work out their
own salvation. But the Maine was destroyed, and at
once a new and mighty factor was brought into the
situation. The honor of America had been trailed in
the mire, and, inexplicable as may seem the fact, it
is trailed in the mire still. While an investigation
conducted with care and dignity has established as
truth the suspicion of Spain's guilt, the verdict is
thrown aside as of no moment and the tones of Sen
atorial eloquence quiver and quaver with tears for
wretched Cuba. Why not some oratory on behalf of
the land which built the Maine and sent her proudly
forth bearing its colors?
If Cuba is freed it will be as a punishment for a
specific wrong â the wanton killing of American citi
zens. If the stars and stripes fly above Morro Castle
it will be because the power centered there betrayed
a sacred trust. If Spain be driven from the West, the
last colonies wrested away, the act must be ascribed
to an outburst of the latent barbarism of Castile cul
minating in the slaughter of innocent and free-born
men. Such is the charge of America against Spain.
No effort of diplomacy, no cunningly contrived
speech, no expressions of sympathy can make us for
get it. It is impossible to understand why any one
should wish to make us forget it, except Spain, jubi
lant at having had the privilege of blowing up a lot
of "Yankees" and now the privilege of approving the
verdict or setting it aside.
We believe in the most complete reparation for the
loss of the Maine. We would have the Spanish for
this crime banished from the Western Hemisphere,
just as any other criminal is sent into exile. But the
course of retribution should be marked throughout
with the utmost frankness. Let it be known to Spain
and to the world that American honor, injured and
maligned, finds no balm in gold, no virtue in prom
ises, and deprives Spain of her possessions not for
gain, not for the sake of the Cubans, not on a general
plea for humanity, but in token that Americans in
Spanish territory, with the American flag waving
over them, are not to be butchered. The Maine will
float no more, but many a brave ship still carries the
colors she bore. It is in memory of the Maine, it is
for the rest of the navy, the honor of American citi
zenship, the safety of Americans everywhere, that the
peopWnow look to Washington for action quick, de
cisive, final. Cuba may benefit, but Cuba is the "in
cident."
MUNICIPAL ECONOMY.
TO our mind it is vain to assert that any system
of finance which can be adopted in this city,
by charter or otherwise, will effectually prevent
deficits in the local treasury. The sources of muni
cipal shortages are found, not in the organic law of
the town, but in the character and disposition of the
officials who disburse the accumulations of the tax
payers. Stringent laws and regulations can never
entirely prevent waste and extravagance in local
government. There is no way to secure an econ
omical municipal administration except to elect men
of ability and character to office.
This is a fact so patent that it seems a useless con
sumption of space to discuss those provisions of the
charter now being published in The Call which pro
vide for a change of system. Under the consolida
tion act most expenditures are fixed by law. This is
the difficulty with the County Clerk's office. The
law authorizes the head of that department to em
ploy a specified number of deputies and to pay them
certain salaries. No one is empowered to vary this
programme, and when the Supervisors appropriate
$76,000 for the County Clerk and that official ex
pends $130,000, the amount authorized by law, the
difference constitutes a deficit.
The new charter abolishes the general fund, sub
stitutes for it "appropriations!' by the Supervisors,
and limits every official to an expenditure of one
twelfth part each month of his appropriation. On
top of this there is a legal limit to taxation. This
undoubtedly abolishes the old system of grouping
most appropriations into one fund, but how will it
prevent deficits if the Supervisors shall continue to
make large appropriations and enact deficient tax
levies? The real cause of deficits has heretofore been
the failure of the Board of Supervisors, in obedience
to platform pledges, to raise a sufficient sum of
money by taxation to satisfy its own demands and
the legal demands of its co-ordinate departments.
How will this be remedied by limiting taxation and
substituting a number of funds for one fund?
Municipal deficits may be prevented by electing as
Supervisors plain men of business. There were no
deficits from 1883 to 1887, because the Supervisors
were determined there should be none. There are
deficits now simply because the Supervisors are care
less and extravagant. Tax-eating is the science of
getting money out of the public treasury with or
without rendering service â preferably the latter. No
system that can be adopted will invade this science
until appropriations are made and tax levies fixed by
men who sincerely desire to put an end to it. The
proposed charter may set up a better method of d"s
bursing the city's money than now prevails, bnt thai
method will not of itself produce economi
cal government. Honest, painstaking officials will
always be a necessary prerequisite of any close sys
tem cf finance.
THE SAN FKAKCISCO CALL, THTJKSDAY, MARCH 31, 1898.
THE FIGHT FOR PURE FOOD.
THE announcement that the Boa.d of Health is
preparing to take more vigorous steps than
ever to prevent the sale of impure milk in the
city will be gratifying to all who are aware of the
danger which lurks in such impurities. The danger
is all the greater because milk is so largely used as
the food of very young children whose systems have
not yet grown strong enough to resist the effects
of anything deleterious in what they eat.
The efforts made some time ago by the board
to protect the public from milk adulterations and
honest dairymen from the competition of dishonest
dealers resulted in much good. Rarely if ever has
the board performed a work which was more useful
to the general mass of citizens or was received
with more popular approval. That experiment in en
forcing the law was completely successful in its main
results, and from it may be drawn auguries of bene
fits to be accomplished by the new movement.
A crusade against the milk adulterators, however,
is not the only work the people expect of the Board
of Health. It is well remembered that the board has
brought to light the fact that a large proportion of
the fruit preserves sold in the city is adulterated.
A new crusade in the direction of suppressing that
evil would be as welcome as the one promised
against the unscrupulous dairymen. In short, the
fight for pure food should be kept up vigorously all
along the line, and if the board is unable to maintain
a continual watch it should make attacks on fraudu
lent dealers so frequently that they will find it cheaper
in the long run to be honest than to attempt to either
defy or evade the law.
The issue is one of growing importance, because
the advance of science is every year providing the un
scrupulous with new means of adulterating food so
cunningly that the average man cannot distinguish
the good from the bad. Vigilance on the part of the
law should increase with the increased activity of the
adulterators. Perhaps in the end a national law will
be required to deal with the subject properly, but in
the meantime municipalities can look out for them
selves. Let the Board of Health go forward with
courage against the wrong. It will have abundant
support from the people.
GREAT BRITAIN AND HER FOES.
DESPITE the attempts of Lord Salisbury and
his colleagues of the Ministry to reassure the
British people in the crisis that confronts the
empire, such confidence as ma/ remain among them
is weakening day by day. Every report from the
Orient shows that the Germans and the Russians are
steadily persisting in their demands upon China, and
every report from Africa notes another advance of
the French toward districts that have been claimed by
the British. Whether or not there is a formal alliance
between the three great powers of the Continent,
it is apparent from the course of events that they are
acting in harmony if not in concert, and that the in
terests of Great Britain are subject to the aggressions
of all.
In this situation there is clearly lacking in Great
Britain any well defined policy of action on the part
of either of the great political organizations. The
Liberals criticize Salisbury for Inaction, but they do
not advance any programme of action to which they
are willing to pledge themselves if restored to power.
Parliament without a dissenting voice voted an
enormous sum for the maintenance and extension of
the naval force of the empire, but not a man in Par
liament had a suggestion to offer as to how that force
should be exerted in the present emergency.
It is a Well-known fact that the- temper of a na
tion is largely determined by the temper of its offi
cial leaders. With a strong man at the head of affairs
a nation is strong. With a weak man it is vacillating.
This truth helps us to an understanding of the Euro
pean situation. Russia and Germany are ruled by
vigorous young men, one of whom is known to be
the most ambitious, proud and dominating ruler of
his time. These men, while perhaps not seeking war,
are not afraid of it. England is under the influence
of an old Queen whose sole desire is to live her re
maining years in peace. Her Prime Minister is old,
broken and in feeble health. He al9o prefers peace
to war. It is not strange that under such contrasted
leadership there should be vigor in the councils of
Russia and Germany, while in Great Britain there is
doubt, hesitation and delay.
With a Queen so desirous of peace as Victoria,
and under a Prime Minister so inclined to prefer dip
lomacy to war as Salisbury^ the prospect of an actual
outbreak over the situation in either China or Africa
is slight. It must be borne in mind, however, that
the British are a high-spirited, aggressive race, and
they will, not always be ruled as they are to-day. It is
written in the stars that sooner or later Great Britain
must fight for her empire, and the force of circum
stances may be such as to compel her to undertake
it now. There is such a thing as twisting the lion's
tail too much, even when the beast has been overfed
and desires to sleep.
There has grown up a habit of abusing Alfred
Austin because he does not often write poetry which
can be recognized as such, but he should be given due
credit when he does thump his lyre and rattle out a
little genuine melody. His latest effort was not per
fect, but it glowed with a kindly sentiment and went
for the most part with a swing and fire. Neither is
the thought of an ultimate alliance between the two
English-speaking countries wholly foolish.
It is time for a law prescribing life imprisonment
for the person who throws vitriol or any chemical
having similar effect with intent to mutilate another.
This crime has just been perpetrated at San Jose by
a woman. Indeed the offender ordinarily is a woman,
so it is a sense of gallantry which would send the
offender to prison rather than to the gallows.
Last evening's papers announced that the chances
for peace were considered good. The man into
whose face another man has expectorated copiously
can always be sure of peace by going away from
there, but some strange people are so constituted that
at such a crisis they would naturally be hankering for
a mixup and a total absence of harmony.
A Spanish sailor ashore at Newport News re
marked that Americans were all coward 9 and afraid
to fight Spain. There is no doubt he was in error,
and yet there has been so notable an effort on the
part of diplomacy to create the impression the sailor

CRUISERS, MINES AND TORPEDOES.
Some Interesting Information on Subjects That Deeply
Concern the Public, but Are Not Gen
erallu Understood,
BY WILLIAM C. BOYNES.
The loss of the Maine and the
strained relations with Spain (for other
reasons) seem to have awakened a
lively general interest in torpedoes and
vessels of war. People generally know
little of either, and as a reply to a
single letter this column is published,
but the information given will doubt
less satisfy most of those who wish
enlightenment on these subjects. In
what follows technical terms are alto
gether avoided as far as at all possible,
the object being to instruct the general
readerâ not the expert. The letter to
which this may be called a reply fol
lows:
The Manager Callâ Sir: As I know
nothing of torpedoes, the use of a torpedo
catcher, how a torpedo is ejected, what
a cnuiser is as distinguished from a fight
ing ship, or much else about such mat
ters, I shall esteem it a favor, etc.
To begin with, it is necessary to
know what a torpedo is. The term use.!
to be applied to any submarine agent
that had destructive power, but to-day
a torpedo is exclusively something pro
pelled at an object for its destruction.
Submarine defense ia divided into
four distinct classes, viz.: (1) Ground
mines. (2) Buoyant self-acting mines.
(3) Controlled buoyant mines, and (4)
torpedoes.
(1) A ground mine la constructed by
placing a suitable amount of explosives
of high power â properly protected â in
position at the bottom of a harbor or
river. They are usually somewhat sunk
in the sand or mud, but rarely in hard
rock. Their principal advantages are
that they permit the use of heavy
charges of explosives without the cor
responding difficulty of mooring, and
that their position is easily determined
and can always be relied on. The num
ber of these wines which it is possible
to place is limited, for they can only
be used in shallow water. They are In
variably electrically connected with a
shore station from which they are flred
at will.
2. The buoyant, self-acting mines
may be fired either by simple mechan
ism or by an electrical device. They
usually consist of a metal case shaped
much like an inflated balloon which is
partially filled with dynamite or gun
cotton. On the top of the case there
protrude a half dozen or so small tubes
of a foot or more in length, and a ship
passing and striking either of these lit
tle tubes violently would break a glass
inner tube which by simple chemical
action in the purely mechanical class
releases a heavy weight which, falling
on the explosive in the bottom of the
case, acts as a detonator and fires the
mine. The electrical automatic mine
is constructed in much the same way,
but the explosion is caused by the
breaking of an electrical current when
either of the tubes at the top of the
case come into violent contact with an
other body. Of course, this class of
mine depends entirely for its usefulness
on the enemy's ship striking one of the
firing tubes.
3. The term controlled buoyant mines
Is applied to those which can be flred
only by electricity from the shore. They
do not differ much from the automatic
mines, and a combination of both has
proved successful. These controlled
mines are usually laid in groups, and
whenever possible and practicable the
electrical connections are made so that
one or any number may be fired at
once. The detonation is of course a
very simple matter. This form of sub
marine defense, though, is extremely
expensive, which prevents its more ex
tended use. These mines, as well as the
automatic, are moored by a chain or
wire cable to a heavy anchor, and by
an ingenious device it is possible to
keep them at any depth below the sur
face which may be deemed advisable.
Here it is interesting to note that it is
unsafe to moor one mine nearer to an
other thon at least six times the radius
of its striking distance. That is to say,
if a mine would work destruction a
hundred feet from where it is anchored
there must be at least 600 feet between
it and its next door neighbor, and 800
feet would be better.
4. For lack of space only one variety
of torpedo â the automobile â can be de
scribed. But it is practically the only
torpedo now in use. These little en
gines of war are really small vessels in
themselves. Shaped much like a ci^ar.
they have a couple of propellers, rud
ders and half a dozen watertight com
partments. The nose or percussion end
holds the cap, then comes the compart
ment devoted to explosives. There is
an air reservoir, a balance "chamber
(where the mechanism for keeping the
machine on an even keel is); there is
the engine compartment and the buoy
ancy chamber. The delicacy and accu
racy of the mechanism of these instru
ments of destruction are amazing. Not
only can they be aimed and fired with
almost the accuracy of a gun, but they
can be made to stop and come to the
surface at any 4 es ' re^ distance from
the ship firing them, and recent experi
ments tend to show that it will be pos
sible in the near future to even zig-zag
their course with accuracy. A torpedo
is ejected by placing it In a tube some
thing like a large grooved pipe. The
amount >t energy required to launch it
is very small, and the moment it
touches the water its engines (worked
usually by compressed air, but some
times electrically) start automatically.
The speed can be rpgulated in any de
sired way, but twenty knots are not at
all unusual. If the torpedo misses its
mark it will continue till Its air pres
sure is exhausted and then rise to the
surface. A Whitehead automobile
usually runs about ten feet below the
surface of the water, but that, too, is
a matter easily regulated.
The term "torpedo catcher" Is a mia
noxnef. It would seem to imply that
there are vessels built for the purpose
of locating and destroying torpedoes.
Indeed the Examiner is evidently of
that opinion, for in an article on things
naval which was Riven due prominence
it says the name of the torpedo catcher
"indicates its mission," which it cer
tainly does not. But that is not start
ling, for in the same article the Maine
was spoken of as a second-class cruiser,
when, of course, she was a second-class
battleship, and a plan of naval action
was mapped out which would make the
tears from a yellow canine stream down
his cheeks from laughter. "Torpedo
catcher" is a corruption of torpedo-boat
catcher, the first name given to the
larger torpedo-boats. Soon after the
advent of the torpedo-boat It became
I evident that means had to be devised
for the destruction of these little ter
rors. The success of the larger speci
mens for that purpose has called Into
existence the class of vessels known as
"torpedo-boat destroyers" â commonly
called simply destroyers. The speed of
a first-class destroyer is about 30 knots
an hour. She is slightly protected,
sometimes has as many as six torpedo
tubes (the old style torpedo-boat had
but one) and carries quite a consider
able battery of rapid-firing guns. The
coal carrying capacity of the destroyer
can never be great as at present con
structed. These little vessels are very
poor targets. They sit deeply in the
water and their speed is so great that
it is practically impossible to hit them,
except by the grace of Mr. Irving
Scott's "lucky shot." How true this is
will be seen from the fact that when
steaming thirty knots an hour the de
stroyer is making over a thousand
yards a minute. In action their prin
cipal mission is to destroy torpedo
boats, to protect battle-ships from them
and incidentally to torpedo the larger
ships of the enemy if possible.
The difference between a battle
ship and a cruiser is best shown by
comparing: a type of each; but the uses
for which each is intended are briefly
these: The battle-ship is for fensive
purposes only. She is intended for
fighting alone and is consequently as
heavily armed and armored as possible.
The cruiser, as thetname implies, is in
tended for a variety of cruising pur
poses; to act as convoy to transports
or commercial vessels, to patrol sea
space to blockade ports, to destroy the
enemy's commerce, and among other
things, to do her share of the fighting
when called into action. Cruisers are
of two types, armored and unarmored,
both of which are necessary to a com
plete navy. Recently, however, more
unarmored cruisers have been built
than those of the fully protected type.
The speed attained by first-class mod
ern cruisers is equal to that of the
fastest ocean greyhounds and supasses
nearly all merchant vessels. They hays
greater coal endurance than battle
ships, and are in a word eminently fit
ted for cruising. A coast defense ves
sel Is little more than a floating bat
tery, and except in great emergency
they are intended to stay close to land.
They are all heavily armed, and, like
the battle-ship, -well armored. In fact,
they carry as large guns as their size
will permit, usually in turrets.
For comparison of a cruiser with a
battle-ship scarcely a better example
could be chosen than the Olympia (she
is a first-class unarmored cruiser) and
the Oregon (a first-class battle-ship).
Both these vessels were built here.
They differ but six feet in length, yet
the breadth (or beam) of the battle
ship is 69 feet and that of the cruiser
but 53 feet. The displacement of the
battle-ship is 10,288 tons, and the
cruiser's but 5870 â little more than half.
The speed of the battle-ship is about 15
knots per hour, while the cruiser can
make nearly 22. In the matter of
armament the difference Is this: The
battle-ship carries four thirteen-inch
breech-loading rifled guns, eight eiKht
lnch and four six-inch of the same
type, with a complement of smaller
arms. The cruiser's heaviest ordnance,
however, is a battery of four eight-inch
guns of the same type, supplemented
by ten of five-inch bore. The equip
ment of lighter guns compares well
with the battleship. But, as will be
seen by what appears above, the uses
for which the vessels are intended
widely diverge. It is a moot question
among naval experts whether the day
for the heaviest type of battle-ships is
not rapidly passing away. At any rate
the increase in the number of torpedo
boats and destroyers in the past few
years has been very noticeable.
IN THE SOLDIERS' DEFENSE.
To the Editor of The Call: The
Chronicle has asserted editorially that no
one, except he is given to drinking or
weakmlndedness, would join the army as
an enlisted man at 513 per month. Now
this may have been written in good faith
and all that, but it certainly does not re
flect credit on the 2".,000 men composing
the army of the United States, nor is it
likely to stimulate the recruiting business.
No one wants to be considered a poor,
weak-minded inebriate because he joins
the army. It seems to me that men who
uphold the dignity and honor of our na
tion should be extolled as noble martyrs
instead of being stigmatized as idiots and
drunkards. As a matter of fact the
average of intelligence and temperance in
the United States army is eaual if not
superior to any military body in the
world. The Chronicle seems to forget the
importance of the soldier. Does not our
very existence hang on the valor and
bravery of the "boys in blue"?
What of it if his pay is small? Is that
not all the more reason why we should
encourage and praise him? Does that de
tract from his fighting qualities? At a
time like this, when every nerve is
strained to increase our strength, when
our hearts are beating in sympathy for
the poor persecuted Cuban and every
patriotic American is anxious for the
fray, it is bad policy to write pessimistic
editorials reflecting on the efficiency of
our national defense.

A Native Daughter Whose Struggles and Privations
Were Considered a Joke at Home.
MISS LILLIAN LAMSON.
When the audience that packed the Columbia Theater last Monday night to
â witness the presentation of "A Naval Cadet" applauded the conclusion of the
first act, the entire praise was not for the popular pugilist. There was another
in the company who was native to the State and whose friends had gathered to
show that they were not unmindful of the credit she had reflected on the city of
her birth since she' left it six years ago to win laurels on the Eastern stage. The
one In question is Miss Lillian Lamson, a San Francisco girl, who, since she first
came before the footlights some seven or eight years ago with Frederick Warde
at the California, has been steadily climbing upward, until she now occupies a
position on the theatrical ladder so near the top that a very little exertion will
place he*r where her glances will travel only downward.
Miss Lamson was born on California street in this city twenty-seven years
ago. She first attended the local public schools, from which after graduating she
was sent across the bay to Snell's Seminary to finish her education. Shortly be
fore her full term at that Institution had been completed her father, who was at
one time a man of considerable wealth, failed, and she was forced to look for
some way of earning feer own living. As she had displayed considerable talent in
a number of private theatrical entertainments, her thoughts naturally turned to
ward the stage, and obtaining an opportunity through the kindness of Mr.
Warde, who was then playing an engagement at the California, she made her
i debut with him as Juliet, scoring an instantaneous success that procured en
gagements for her at the local theaters, where- she continued to play different
parts for the next lew years.
Finally she decided to go East, where she played with a number of different
organizations until three years ago, when she accepted an offer to become the
leading lady of Corbett's company, where she has remained ever since.
"I am glad to get home, of course," said Miss Lamson yesterday, "because it
Is here that my parents live and the associations of my girlhood are brought to
mind. I must say, however, that the papers of my native town have not been
as kind to me as I could wish. I don't mean in the matter of dramatic criticism.
Of that I have no complaint to make. I mean that when I went on the sta2e I
went because I needed the money to support myself and help my parents. This
fact, as well as all my private family matters and personal eccentricities have
been made the subject of so many cruel articles that I rather dread an Interview
as I don't know in what light I will be made to appear in the morning.
"I don't wish to claim any unusual talent for myself, as I would rather let
my acting and the critics speak for me. Whatever success I have made is the re
sult of many a hard day's work and many a bitter lesson in self-abnegation.
Why, I have been In New York when I did not know where I was to eat or sleep
during the next twenty-four hours, and have gone for months and months want
ing many of the necessaries of life, to say nothing of the comforts, in my en
deavor to win my own way and not burden with the expense of my support
parents who couid ill afford it. And when that is all past and I find myself on the
way to prosperity, I must confess that it is rather more gratifying to get kind
words from the people at home than to have my past hardships and mortifica
tions made the subject of unkind jests and cutting sneers."
Miss Lamson married Andrew Robson of the "Blue Jeans" company some
time ago, but the couple decided to separate, owing to incompatibility of tem
per, and have not been living together for nearly two years past.

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 31, 1898.
BASEBALL HAS
COME TO STAY
With Dual Leagues the
Games Are Certain to
Be Hard Fought.
Midweek Gossip of Doings on
the Home and Interior
Diamonds.
Interior Clubs Begin the Importation
of Players to Strengthen Weak
Points.
"With two regularly organized leagues
playing ball in this city every Saturday
and Sunday it looks as though the na
tional game had come to stay. Since the
death of the old California League base
ball has b_een in a state of coma here, but
although the public has refused to pa
tronize the games tbe players have kept
themselves in constant practice, with the
result that there are scores of ball play
ers in California to-day who are capable
of putting up as fast a game as the most
ardent crank would care to see. During
the past half-dozen years many have
graduated from the sandlots into the pro
fessional ranks, and these, with such of
the old players who have kept themselves
in the game, have been drafted into the
present organization. They will have to
put up the.bes*. they have in stock, for
San Francisco is comparatively small,
and even in its palmiest days, from a
baseball standpoint, it would have been
difficult for two leagues to exist here.
Consequently, unless both organizations
uncork the blue ribbon article and play
right up to their limit all tne time, one
or the other will be forced to the wail,
for with the teams of either league har
vesting naught but icicles that band is
doomed. At best, the interior clubs can
do little more than meet expenses on their
home grounds and when visiting other
interior points, so that the profit must be
derived from the San Francisco games.
All these facts justify the prediction that
every man who plays ball on a Califor
nia diamond this year will have to excel
his previous efforts in order to keep in
line, and the slightest let-up will be the
signal for his release. Slovenly played
games, dragged out to more than two
hours, unless they be extra Inning games,
will no longer be tolerated. Short, sharp
contests, full of life and episode, are what
the patrons demand and what they will
get with the two leagues bidding for
popularity.
The Fresno team of the California
League is determined to have the best
there if going. This is the first season
Fresno has ever been represented in a
regular State league, and the people there
are anxious to prove their oft-made as
sertion that theirs is one of the best base
ball towns in the State. The managers of
the team have plenty of capital behind
them, and have spared no expense in get
ting together a strong aggregation and
giving it a good home. A new ball park
has been laid out, with grand stand and
bleachers capable of seating several
thousand people erected. Regular sal
aries are guaranteed the players, and the
strongest team it has been possible to
secure has been gathered. But not con
tent with those now under contract, the
management has sent East for more
players, and has secured a battery from
Dcs Moines and a shortstop from one of
the "Western League teams. The names
of these players are kept secret at pres
ent, the managers preferring to spring
th.^m as a surprise when they make their
fir. t appearance, but they are said to be
exceedingly fast. Fresno was to have
opened its new grounds last Sunday, but
a heavy rain Friday night soaked up the
diamond so that it could not be played
on. The opening of the season will take
place April 3, when San Francisco will
meet the babies.
A strong effort Is being made to induce
President Bert of the Pacific States
League to reinstate McGulre of the San
Francisco team. After McGuire's un
warranted attack upon Daubenbis at the
close of last Sunday's game at Central
Park, President Bert ordered the first
baseman's instant release. He said there
might be some excuse for a man who
struck another in the heat of passion,
but MeGuire nursed his wrath until the
close of the game and then *mote Dau
benbis, which act was sufficient to prove
him unworthy of being allowed to go
upon a diamond. Manager Crowley has
represented to Bert that if the latter's
order holds another member of the San
Franciscos will leave the team, but Bert
wa-s obdurate, and said McGulre could
not play any more if every man in the
team withdrew.
The strong teams presented by Oakland,
Fresno and San Francisco of the Califor
nia League have made the managers of
San Jose. Stockton and Sacramento do
some bracing up of their weak points.
San Jose has secured Oui^elder Parker
and Catcher Weed, both strong men,
while Sacramento has signed Kdwards,
Spokane's famous outfielder, and Catcher
J. R. SuSMvan, who has played with both
the Western and Eastern Leagues. Stock
ton has not been behind , and has gatnered
in its old battery, Iberg and Peters, who
did the brunt of the work for ftie Cali
fornia Markets last season. In addition
Beck, a pitcher from Seattle, with a good
record, has been secured for the season.
Treasurer Bonnet of the Pacuic States
League has on hand $15 SO, received from
the games at Central Park and Sacra
mento last Sunday, which is to be held
until the close of the season when it will
be divided between the first three clubs,
the winner taking ha'f and the other two
dividing the remainder. Two per cent of
every' game played is to be set aside for
this purpose, so that the fund will be
worth battling for, and is a further guar
antee of good ball. San Francisco con
tributed $6 SO of the amount turned in
and Sacramento $9, while San Jose has
not yet made its report.
The California League has a similar
fund, setting aside PA per cent of the re
ceipts for that purpose.
THROWN FROM THEIR BERTHS.
Suit of Brandt Against the Southern
Pacific Company for Fifty Thou
sand Dollars' Damages.
In the United States Circuit Court yes
terday the trial of the suit of Ernest
Brandt against the Southern Pacific Com
pany was begun before a jury. Brandt
asks for $50,000 damages for injuries al
leged to have been sustained on the
southbound train, near Roseville Junc
tion on March 30, 18^7, when he was
thrown from his berth by a sudden stop
page of the train, and his shoulder was
dislocated, crippling him for life, as he
alleges. Brandt is a subject of Great
Britain. His wife,' Susannah, died of her
Injuries, and Brandt has another suit for
JSO 000 damages for her death.
Two passengers testified that they were
also thrown out of their berths, but wit
nesses for the railroad company denied
that there was any accident on that oc
casion.
Will Purchase Meeker's Grove.
The special meeting called by the Bo
hemian Club yesterday afternoon for the
purpose of considering the proposition of
the purchase of Meeker's Grove, near
Guerneville. resulted in a unanimous vote
in favor of it. Aft^r considerable dis
cussion it was decided to issue bonds cov
ering the entire amount asked by the
Sonoma Land and Lumber Company for
the property, which will be immediately
issued. % This grove that is soon to pass
into the possession of the "Bohemians"
of this city has been their favorite spot
for years for holding their annual high
jinks, and the actual possession of it
means many of those mysterious noc
turnal events so appropriate to un
civilized regions.
Will Go to the Jury To-Day.
The second trial of Dr. Samuel H. Hall,
who is aroused of having, through crim
inal malpractice, caused the death of Mrs.
Ida Coakley.. will be concluded to-day in
Judge Dunne's court.
808 MITCHELL, the Latest Adjunct of the Tivoli Company
Another of San Francisco's popular amateur minstrels and vaude
ville artists will loin his fortunes to the army of professional Thespians and â¢
launch out in a footlights career for all time. This time it is Bob Mitchell, and
the scene of his first professional venture will be the Tivoli, Saturday evening,
April 9, at the initial performance of "Sinbad."
Mitchell Is thoroughly well known to San Francisco. Whenever a charitable
organization entertained its friends with a performance of any kind, it was an
even bet that Bob Mitchell would appear in black. He has filled a number of
roles running the scale from minstrel to the prlma donna in a Chinese opera.
His latest successes have ~een in tne Olympic minstrel aggregation, among -which
Mitchell was always seen on the end.
If success as an amateur is any index of what will be his portion of popular
approval as a professional, Autchell's career on the boards will be strewn with all
kinds of sweet flowers. He is a natural low comedian, with full knowledge of
his craft. As a minstrel or in eccentric parts Mitchell displays an aptitude that
fits in readily with the character he attempts to present. His voice is also well
suited to eccentric low comedy parts. What he may lack at firs, is assurance,
composure and self-control.
Mitchell's part in "Sinbad" will be Chokey, twin of Hokey, to be piayed by
Branson They are detectives, and their adventures would fill a modern "Arab
ian Nights" book with phantasmagoric tales. Linked together by spiritual affini
ties these Siamese sleuthhounds do wondrous things.
The first performance of "Sinbail" will be attended by large theater parties,
all gathered to trumpet the first stroke of the stage career -of their friend Bob
Mitchell The several cycling annexes of the Olympic Club will be on hand in a
body. Floral pieces in profusion have already been ordered and the young hls
trion' may anticipate a deluge of flowers.

MIDNIGHT
CAPERS OF A
LOCAL TEMBLOR
W. F. Howe Narrowly Es=
capes Death in a Razed
Building.
Much Alarm Caused Here and in
Other California Towns, but
Little Damage of a
Serious Nature.
At exactly 17 minutes to 12 o'clock
last night, as shown by the halted
hands of the clocks, San Francisco was
shaken by the severest earthquake that
has visited it in many years. There
was no preliminary tremor, so far as
downtown observers know, but without
an instant's warning the- rocking be
gan. So long was the movement con
tinued, and so violent was it, that re
ports the most exaggerated, born
of the terror and surprise of the mo
ment, were at once in circulation. It
is probably no exaggeration to say the
shook lasted ten seconds, but which
way the earth was moved must be left
to the determination of scientific in
struments. Nobody who was under
going the sensation of being churned
by the forces of nature, and who was
thoughtful enough to take out his
watch and time the jolts, has yet been
found.
There were in the restaurants to
which after-theater parties resort
scenes of panic almost comical
at the time, but no on-looker apre
ciated the funny side of them. People
who had ordered refreshments fled for
the outer air and forgot everything ex
cept an ardent desire to get away from
there.
Some trivial accidents were reported.
At 687 Mission street plastering fell, to
the great alarm of the inmates. In a
lodging-house at Minna and Third
streets an overturned lamp set fire to
the curtains, but it was quickly sub
dued. Probably there were many
niinor accidents of this description.
"Wild rumors were at once started, but
traced to their source proved to be
based more on fright than actual hap
pening.
Naturally much Interest centered
about the Claus Spreckels building at
Third and Market streets, this being
the tallest structure in the city. People
had looked forward to seeing it sub
jected to some such test as it received
last night. The result was an absolute
triumph for the structure. While it
swayed, as was inevitable in an edifice
rising nineteen stories, it sustained not
a sign of injury. Nq plastering crack
ed, no joint yielded. At the moment of
the shock several gentlemen were in the
rooms of the San Francisco Club on the
seventeenth floor engaged in playing
â billiards. They did not stop the games.
Everybody realized that the unusual
was happening and that the ground
was some distance below, but there was
nothing in the nature of a rush for the
elevator. Later the chief engineer of
the building gave it an inspection from
basement to flagpole and found it with
out sign of fla r .v.
In the hotels people jumped from
their beds at a lively rate, each explain
ing that his purpose was to see how
other people were acting under the im
pulse of fear. Of course these searchers
after the truth did not own to any
pangs of fear themselves, yet they sat
about for a long time after the bosom
of Mother Earth had sunk to its ac
customed repose and discussed the sit
uation.
Many men turned pale. Men who de-
THE COLLAPSE ON CLEMENTINA STREET WHICH NEARLY COST W. F, HOWE HIS LIFE
clared they could not be scared by any
earthquake turned white as chalk, and
when they called for a drink to sooth
their troubled breasts there -was a
quaver in their voices which bespoke a
feeling not of unruffled joy.
â  The house at 445 Clementina street
was a total wreck. The hero of the
day or rather night was William F.
Howe, who, after discovering that the
door of the house was jammed in
such a way that it, was impossible to
get out, broke out a pane of glass with
his hand and then after raising the
â window helped his wife and relatives
on the sidewalk, from where they were
Boon taken to Mrs. O'Brien's grocery
Btore across the street. Upon examina
tion it was discovered that Howe had
sustained severe bruises about the body
and after he had removed every one
from the wrecked building fainted on
the sidewalk and was carried across the
street.
Howe had lived in the building with
his wife and mother-in-law, Mrs.
Davis, and In the seme building were
Charles Bergstein and family, Mr. Tier
ney, Mr. Kaiser. Mr. Hoffman, George
Mills and their families.
It was thought to be a miracle that
many lives were not lost in the col
lapse of the dwelling. The injured man
blames the owner of the property for
the acefdent, as he states that on many
occasions he had been notified of the
condition of the house. According to
his reports the building had been in a
state of collapse for many months and
all attempts to have it reconstructed
were without avail.
George Mills was one of the first men
on the street after the shock, and when
he saw that the door of the building
was jammed in he went to the window
which had been broken by Howe and
i assisted him in rescuing the frightened
I women in the building. All along the
street windows had been broken out
and panic reigned supreme. A chemical
engine was soon on the scene, although
I no blaze had been reported.
Two chimneys on the old Supreme
Court building on Larkin and McAllis
ter streets were so twisted by the
shock that they are momentarily ex
pected to fall. The Fire Department
was summoned last right and stretched
ja line prohibiting travel wTtTiin the dan
ger limits.
Marion Crawford, the lecturer, was
dining with Mayor Pond. "I am used
to earthquakes," said Mr. Crawford,
"and was only afraid that Pond would
get frightened and run away without
paying for his dinner." â 
As Mr. Crawford was in Ischia in
1885, when an earthquake claimed 6000
victims, last night's affair failed to give
him a new emotion.
Rev. Dr. J. E. Scott was attending a
meeting on the third floor of the City
of Paris building. He said: "It seemed
to us all as if the building would sure
ly fall. The chandeliers vibrated in
the most erratic manner, the chains
not swinging in any one direction, how
ever, but seeming to get into a general
entanglement."
Max Popper and Joseph Nougues
rushed from the room in the Phelan
building, where the Democratic Cen- j
tral Committee was in session, feeling
that the building would surely fall.
Walter Vail was in his bed at the j
Palace Hotel. So violent was the shock j
that it tore plastering from the ceiling !
and he hastily dressed, bringing out a j
large piece of plastering with him. !
"I rushed into the street as :
soon as I could dress, for I felt sure
that a shock that did so much damage \
in the hotel must have seriously hurt
tall buildings. The first agreeable sur- j
prise I met was to see the Claus j
Spreckels building standing as solidly ;
as Gibraltar."
The earthquake was felt quite se- i
verely along the water front, though no â¢
serious damage was reported.
Considerable plastering was thrown j
down in the Strathmore building oppo- I
site the new City Hall on Larkin street ;
and some of the floors were severely {
wrenched.
At the Merchants' Exchange a con
siderable amount of plastering was de
stroyed.
Reports from the seashore show that
there was a lively shake at the Cliff
House. The Seal Rock House shook
like a ship at sea and reports indicate
that the effect was particularly vio
lent at the beach.
"William E. Lacombe, staying at the
New Washington Hotel, at 342 Fourth
street, was so alarmed at the shock
that he jumped through a glass door,
sustaining a serious cut of the right
wrist.
At the Southern Police Station Cap
tain Spillane restrained his men who
were ready to fly, remarking: "Gen
tlemen, you are not now making a bluff
at rescuing Lieutenant Burke."
At the Receiving Hospital one pa
tient who was expected to die, on feel
ing the shock, rose from his bed and

ern T'nion electric clock at 11:42' i..
The earthquake took place Jus* at the
time that all the police officers are re
porting on and off duty, and they all re
ported that the shock was uniform all

one of the recording instruments of the electric generators in the power
department of the Claus Spreckels building by Chief Engineer Wolters.

I very much in error. Mr. Cole is not seri

I to alarm his family for his safety. Ho is
able to be up and about and expects to be
among his acquaintances downtown in a

TWO DAIRYMEN
WERE ARRESTED
Early Results of the New
Crusade for Pure
Milk.
Dozens of Wagons Are Being
Held Up Nightly by
Inspectors.
Cans of Pure Water for the Pur
poses of Adulterntion Were
Found.
Chief Food and Milk Inspector Dockery
of the Board of Health is not losing any
time in the renewed crusade against im
pure milk that is known to be coming into
this city in considerable quantities.
Acting on his instructions two arrests
were made yesterday morning. One waa
A. Mozette, and th% other the senior
member of the firm of Baumann Bros.,
who came in for considerable notoriety
at the time that cows were being inspect
ed for tuberculosis. Both were taken into
custody as they were entering the city
over the San Bruno road, which passes
their ranches. Their cases will be called
in the Police Court this morning, and a
determined effort made to secure convic
tions.
Inspector Dockery and his men have the
city thoroughly districted, and not a night
passes without dozens of wagons being
Inspected. Four inspectors are stationed
In as many portions of the city, while Mr.
Dockery and his assistants guard the
main avenues through which milk arrives
within the city limits.
, In a large number of instances recently
cans of clear water have been found in
the wagons, showing unmistakably that
adulteration is going on. In the majority
of cases where the water-laden wagons
were not those of previous offenders, the
inspectors have been content with dump
ing the water into the gutter and letting
the drivers off with a warning.
A careful record is kept of all Instances
where water or adulterated milk is found
In the wagons, and a second offense is
certain to bring arrest. Inspector Dock
ery declares that the crusade will be
kept up until not a quart of impure milk
is allowed to reach the consumers of the
city. __^_^^

He was a foreman of the street cleaning de-
partment in New York City and, when speaking
of Ripans Tabules, said: "I used to have lots
of trouble with my heart, caused, my doctor
said, from an imperfect digestion. Amongst other
remedies I used Ripans Tabules, and they are the
finest thing I ever tried. They 'knocked out' the
indigestion, and relieved the - trouble in my heart,
whatever it was. Since I began to use them, my
bowels are regular, and I feel ten per cent better.
I can't recommend them too highly."

Joaquin Eslaba Hears of
His Crime and
Smiles.
He Must Answer for the Brutal
Killing of Crippled
Gates.
The Young Murderer Sits In the
Court and. Appears to Enjoy
the Trial.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, March 30.
Joaquln Eslaba, the confessed murderer
of the crippled tamale vender, was exam
ined in the Police Court this morning and
was held to answer for murder.
The most unconcerned man, apparently,
in the court room was the murderer. lie
seemed to consider the proceedings some
what dull and uninteresting, and I
deprecatingly at Prosecuting Attorney
Melvin when that gentleman considered
It necessary to ask the witnesses so many
questions. He listened to all the testi
mony and occasionally smiled. There was
not a semblance of shame or sorrow visi
ble, and even the sight of the pie^e of
gas pipe which had been bent on his vic
tim's head and still retains evidences of
the fearful crime did not appear to be ob
jectionable to the man in the dock. His
blood-stained clothes were carefully in
spected by him. and the proceedings con
tained no testimony that could bring out
the least display <>f feeling.
Otis Baker, the father-in-law of Eslaba,
identified the murderer and said he knew
him, but did not know that he was vicious
or had a criminal disposition.
Gracie Galindo, the girl who was of
gTeat assistance in arresting the murder
er, inasmuch a-s she had peon him at the
tamale parlor when she and her compan
ion lef'w, was the next witness. She told
of her visit to the cellar where the crime
was perpetrated. She *aid that her friend
John Metz and Eslaba drank some beer,
but all were sober at 10 o'clock, when she
and Metz left. Metz, who followed her
on the stand, told a similar story.
Detective Denny Holland told the story
of the crime as it had been told him by
Eslaba. He paid the prisoner confessed
to striking the tamale man over the head.
Eslahs. t.'.i'l the detective of stealing $1 75
and of taking the trousers off the mur
dered man and putting them on over his
own so as to hide the bloodmarks. He
said he had on his coat when he started
to beat his victim, but when he saw that
Gates was dying he took off his coat,
: I up his sleeves and finished the hor
- :ob.
To Officer Kyte the murderer said he
was po mad when he was committing the
murder that he did not know what instru
ment he used.
Dr. Buteau described the fearful condi
tion in which he found the head of the
murdered man. After the testimony.
Judge Allen held Eslaba to answer for
murder and he was removed to the Coun
ty Jail. .
THE SCHOOL QUESTION.
A Lengthy Discussion and No Con
clusion Reached as to What
Shall Be Done.
ALAMEDA, March :>:>.â There was a'
large attendance at the meeting of citi- .
ng to take action with re
gard to relieving the overcrowded schools.
port was made by the committee of
thirteen who had been investigating the
matter, which disapproved of the high
school plan and recommended the erection
â :ew grammar school In such location
Â»as would best relieve the overcrowded
â schools. Such a building could be erected
for $30,000 to 135.000, and it was believed
that the people would vote the necessary
bonds for the purpose. This report was
signed by Rev. G. R. Dodson, as chair
man of the committee, but he took occa
sion, in the course of the discussion, to
disclaim any approval of the suggestion.
A lengthy discussion foUowed, in which
all phases of the matter were handled,
and the meeting finally adjourned with

1 went into office with Mayor Davie three
years ago. For a long time there has
been a rtamoring that the appointments

j Thomas and City Attorney Dow, the Ro
i publican majority, could not agree on
! suitable men. The changes were made
! to-day by the votes of the Mayor and
i City Engineer Clement, and all the ap
! pointees are Republicans with the excep
j tion of Chief Ball, who is a Democrat.
' This appointment was given to Clement,
' who is the Democratic member of the

i therefore looted the treasury- The Mayor
! objected to this and told Mr. Dow that
;on former occasions when he (Dow)
1 wanted to combine, combinations were all
! right, but that now they were evidently
j all wrong. â 
Mr. Clement said he was not tied up
to vote for Harry Thomas, and if it wero
! shown that he had done anything wrong,
; he would vote to remove him.
Mr. Dow asked if Chief Lloyd had not
i made a good and efficient officer, and Mr.
i Clement said he did not think the manner
I in which Lloyd had acted in the Bro?na
' ham incident was anything very credit
'< able. The Mayor paid he did not care
I to answer Mr. Dow's questions. Mr. Dow
'â  replied that there had been scandal
i enough at the City Hall and the people
; could now judge who were responsible
i for it.
William F. Fletcher, the new Chief of
i Police, is a veteran officer. He was
! born in Bloomfield, 41 .\. sixty-one years
1 ago, and has been a member of the Oak

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, 3IARCH 31, 189 S.
HARRY THOMAS
IS INDICTED
Charged With Inducing a
Witness to Commit
Perjury.
Result of the Note Asking
Hammerton for a
Loan.
McKenrie Cannot Secure a Bond and
Is Forced to Remain in
Jail.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, March 30.
Just before it adjourned this evening,
the Grand Jury returned an indictment
against Harry Thomas, secretary of the
Board of Public Works. It charges sub
ornation of perjury, and fixes bail at $3000.
The indictment Is the direct result of
the story told to the jury by Robert Mc-
Kenzie, who was for a time Harry
Thomas' companion in the Board of
Works office. McKcnzie is the man who j
carried a letter from Thomas to Officer j
Hammerton, asking for a loan of $100.
Thomas denied writing me letter, and
: yesterday the story of the affair was told
to the Grand Jury.
Mcxvenzie at first stuck to his story that
i he did not carry the letter to Hammer
: ton and knew nothing whatever of it. He
i then changed his testimony and said that
Harry Thomas had told him to say he
knew nothing whatever of the letter and
to deny that he carried it to Hammerton.
This story McKenzie stuck to until he
realized that he, too, was in danger, and
then he told what he now claims to be the
! truth.
Harry Thomas was before the Jury to
i day, and was asked about the "H. W. T."
letter to Hammerton. He was asked if
i he wrote It.
"On the advice of my attorney, I must
; decline to answer that question," he re
plied.
"Cannot you tell us whether It is in
your handwriting?" asked a Juror.
"I have no other answer to make at this
timo," said Thomas.
The witness then denied that he had
I entered into a conspiracy with McKenzie
to give false testimony. He said he had
consulted with attorneys because he con
sidered it the wisest thing to do.
Before noon the vote of the Grand Jury
was taken to indict Harry Thomas for
subornation of perjury, in that he at
â  tempted to induce McKenzie to go before
a legally constituted body and give false
testimony under oath. It was late this
evening before the papers were drawn up
and served. Harry Thomas was at the
c.rurthouse, and his attorney, Emil Nus
baumer, at once saw to the preparation
i for the bond which is signed by A. M.
i Farwell and Charles Butler. As soon as
the bond was approved Harry Thomas
was released from the custody of the
Sheriff. .. . . . .
Robert McKenzie was not indicted, but
he is Just a little less fortunate than his
i late friend Harry Thomas, for he is held
! as a witness under $SCO bonds, and as he
cannot furnish it he is still at the County
â¢1 do not fear this indictment." said
Harry Thomas this evening, "for I have
nut been guilty of anything. McKenzie a
story was told simply because he thought
he was in a hole himself and he thought
he could help himself out at my expense.
I haven't askod him to go before the
Grand Jury and perjure himself and I am
confident o*f being able to clear myself.
Thomas will not say whether he wrote
the letter or not. He says that whenDow
i fired the question at him at the Board of
! Works The quickly denied it. but he .ays
i that does not prove anything. lamat j
I liberty to borrow money if I see fit, he
said to-night, "and I don't think anybody
i has a right to criticize me for it. At the
same time, knowing that the Grand jury
was after me I did not feel Justified in
talking too freely."

BLOODY BATTLE
IN CHINATOWN
Officer George Tracey
Shot by a Desperate
Highbinder.
Chinese Shoot a Countryman
and Give the Police a
Hard Tussle.
Two Hatchetmen In Cells at the Cali
fornia - Street Station âNo
Wounds Fatal.
The deadly highbinder feud In China
town has broken out in all its old fury,
and this time the Chinese have not
scrupled to turn their weapons against
the arresting officers. As a result of the
endeavor of two of the hired thugs to kill
one of their race in Chinatown last even
ing. Officer George Tracey of Sergeant
! Shea's posse lies on a bed in St. Mary's
i Hospital with a bullet hole in his left
i arm, and Lum Pier, the man marked for
i the assassin's bullet, is at the Harbor
i Hospital, shot through the left leg above
I the knee.
It was shortly after 11 p. m. that Offi
cers Tracey, John Galloway and John
Burke, all members of Sergeant Shea's
Chinatown squad, while passing up Jack
son street, paw the flash and heard the
report of a revolver at the Intersection i
of Sullivan alley. They rushed to the spot
and ran into two Chinese endeavoring to
make their escape.
One of tbem was Â» randishing a huge i
Colt's revolver in order to frighten the '
policemen out of his path. Officer Gal- I
10W&y grappled with this Chinaman, who |
wriggled round and pulled the trigger of i
his revolver while trying to place it !
against Galloway's body. The bullet
missed that officer and struck Tracey in
the- arm, inflicting an ugly but not serious
wound. The murderous heathen was not
given another chance to usr> his weapon
but was promptly handcuffed, the other
highbinder being secured at the same
time.
An ambulance was summoned and Tra
cey sent to St. Mary's Hospital, while It
was coming the officers directing their at
tention to a Chinaman who lay groaning
in the alley. He was found to be suffering
from a bullet wound in the left leg. The
wounded Chinese was sent to the Harbor
Hospital in the patrol wagon.
( in examination he was found to be
phot through the left leg above the knee,
the bullet passing through the bone and
making a clean wound. He will recover
and the leg will not have to be amputated
if inflammation does not set in. The name
of the woumlf-d Chinese is Lum Sier. He
says he was standing in the alley when
the two men came up behind and shot
him.
Galloway and Burke took their two men
to the California-street Police- Station
and placed their names on the "small
book," pending the result of the shoot
ing. They gave the names of Bah Non
and Tuner Yee. Non was the one who
shot Officer Tracey, but the Identity of
the one who shot Lum Sier is not known.
The circumstances would point to Bah
Non as the would-be murderer.
DECRIES PROFESSIONALISM.
Editor Creed of the Califoraian De
clares It Has Demoralized
Baseball.
BERKELEY, March 3n.â Editor Creed
of the Daily Californian, in this morning's
issue of the college daily, declares that
the national game has been demoralized
by the inroads of professionalism, and
that the general public in San Francisco
is being "baseballed to death." He says:
"ProfessionaJ teams are as thick as
mushrooms in San Francisco and the sren
eral public in that city is baseballed to
death. The decision of the management
to play the remaining- contests on the
campus was the only course open under
the circumstances and should meet with
hearty approval. A game which has been
demoralized by the inroads of profes
sionalism to the extent baseball has can
find no better place for improvement than
a college campus."

BRODERICK OBJECTS.
Will Address the Supervisors Re- '
garding the Cost of the New
Insane Ward.
Auditor Broderick is preparing a vigor
ous protest to the Board of Supervisors
regarding the manner in which city funds
are being expended in the establishing of
an insane ward in connection with the
Receiving Hospital.
He will call attention to the fact that
the original resolution called for the ex
penditure of $4Â©o, and that since that time
bills have been run up aggregating $800.
Mr. Broderick objects to the manner in
which the matter has been handled, and
calls attention to a similar state of af
fairs when the sewerage system at the
City and County Hospital was in course i
of reconstruction. The original cost of '
that improvement was computed at $I<XK) i
but nearly $6000 was expended before the !
job was finished.
Dr. Sussdorf Sued.
Dr. Gustave E. Sussdorf, superintendent
of the City and County Hospital, was
sued yesterday in the Justine's court by
W. S. Morrow, a collector, on a nromisaorv
note. The Instrument binds Sussdorf to
pay $52 50 within six months from the
time the note was executed.
FIFTY YEARS
AS A PRIEST
Remarkable Career of
Father Demesani of
the Jesuits.
A Celebration Will Be Held In
Honor of the Aged Priest
Next May.
Brief Notes From the { Different
Churches Throughout the
City.
For fifty years Father Te!esphoru3 >
I Demesani of the Society of Jesus (Jesuit
community) has had the highest ideals of i
a preacher continually hefore his mind, j
Although 75 years of age, he Is in perfect ;
health and is In possession of all his fac- <
ultles, looking less an old man. in fact,
than many half his own age.
For half a century he has labored for
the church and has consecrated the
flower of his youth and the bloom , of his
manhood in the study of man and God, j
converting the one by disseminating the j
truth and the words of the other. Hjp has
lived all these years in the world and at
the same time beyond it, taking no in- '
terest in earthly affairs other than to,ad
minister to the wants of suffering hurran-
Ity. For fifty years he has labored i! V tne ;
I cause of righteousness, piety and virtue; ;
j and to crown his noble career he is to |
| see the day that both his fellow-workers, ;
i and those he has labored for, will honor j
his name by a celebration seldom seen in
the Catholic Churchâ a monument of de
votion ajid prayer erected to the memory
of a man still living. The celebration next
May will mark the first of its character
erer held in the Catholic Church in this
city.
Father Bemesanl was born in Rome,
Italy, on the 11th of May. 1823. It was dur
ing "the early years of his boyhood that
he first manifested the desire of entering
the church, and at the age of 16 he was
admitted into the Order of Jesuits.
From this early period his brilliant ca
reer dates. After several years of close
application to study he left the college
and taught for several months in a Cath
olic seminary.
After his return to the college where he
had first taken up the work of Christ he
again pursued his studies for several
years and was finally ordained a priest
of the order on the 2d of May, IS4B.
Boon after his ordination he was sent
on a mission to Canada, where he re
mained for twenty years preaching,
teaching and working lndefatigably in
the cause of Christianity.
On October 9, IVJS, he arrived in San
Francisco and joined the society of Jesu
its in the old St. Ignatius College on Mar
ket street, which formerly occupied the
present site of the Emporium building.
He remained in this city until IKK7, when
he left here to take the professorship of
philosophy in the Santa Clara College
and at the same time the ministry of the
Catholic Church at Mountain View (Santa
Clara).
He held the professorship at the college
until July, 1594, when he was recalled to
again resume his duties In this city.
From this time he has continually re
mained here, being employed in teaching
moral philosophy and modern languages
in the new college on Grove street.
In addition to an acute and thorough
knowledge of moral philosophy, he is an
accomplished linguist, speaking French
and other languages with the fluency of a

"A Man's Responsibility in Social Life"
was the subject the Rev. H. E. Cooke
chose to expound before the business men
at the half-hour Lenten exercises in the
rooms of the Chamber of Commerce yes
terday noon.
"Jesus is the true and actual leader in
social life." said the preacher, "He came
not to be ministered unto, but to minister
unto others, and we should take Jesus as
our example, for he was the model of
goodness and a man amongst men. He
formed, and. in fact, molded society to
his own idea and he carried his joyous
Christian life everywhere with him.
"Although God," he. continued, "gave
his life as a ransom for many. He did not
shun the social life, but on the contrary
assisted in perfecting it.
"Our conversation, whether at home or
in business circles, should be s<uch as to
edify those who come in contact with us;
and* with the aid of prayer this can be
done."
The usual interest and religious feeling
was manifested in the services and an un
usual number of clerks and business men
generally were in attendance.
ON THE TRAIL
OF A BURGLAR
How a Slick Individual Is
"Working" the House
holders.
Pretends to Be the Employe of a
Gas Company and Annexes
Valuables.
Detectives Reynolds and Dlnan are In a
quandary which Is worrying them almost
to distraction as the various men in the
upper office of the police are endeavoring
to outdo one another with captures worth
speaking about. Within the last few days
many small and some large burglaries
have taken place In various portions of
the city, and the detectives in question
were detailed on the case by the Chief nf
Police. According to the reports made to
the office by parties who have been re
lieved of their valuables there Is a "sMok"
individual working in the city, who has
evidently been in the business before, and
in consequence the detectives are woik
ing all the harder.
The party who is being looked for by
the police visits a residence which suits
his fancy and tells a tale of his being
employed by either a local gas or electric
company and gives a card with the name
of William Tell written on it, and states
that he has been sent by the company
by which he Is employed to look over the
fixtures to see that everything is in work
ing order. As is natural in such cases con
fidence is reposed in him by the parties
in the various residences, and he is given
free access to all parts of any house
which he may be operating in.
However, when the occupants of the
house begin to look over their valuables
the next day it is soon discovered that
something out of the ordinary has been
taking place and the thefts have finally
been traced to the gas fixture repairer.
Mrs. Levy, who lives on Larkin street,
called at the office of the Chief of Police
last evening and reported that the man
had visited her residence, but that luck
ily she had not been robbed of anything
which had so far been missed, but the
facts were given that many neighbors bad
complained of both small and heavy
losses and the description given by the
losers tallies in every detail with that
given on previous occasions by those who
had been unfortunate enough to have be
lieved in the tale recited by the one who
has evidently worked his game in other
cities, as it is stated he is exceedingly
clever and has the appearance of one w-io
would be believed under ordinary condi
tions.
Without doubt the guilty party will toon
be arrested as the description given Is ac
curate according to all reports given by
those who have had tne pleasure of h's
company and the pain of discovering their
loss upon looking over ihelr valuables in
a short time after the departure of the
much-wanted man.
SHARKEY MAKES
A STATEMENT
He Will Fight Jeffries Where
the Best Inducements Can
Be Had.
But an Eastern Man Must Bo Se
lected to Referee the
Match.
Thomas Sharkey, the young and
hard-hitting pugilist who will not take
a back seat from any of the heavy
weight champions of the ring, gave The
Call last evening the following state
ment which speaks for itself:
San Francisco, March 29. 1898.
Sporting Editor The Call: As
there has been considerable talk
recently about a contest between
Jeffries and myself, I think it only
right to let my friends know how
I stand in the matter. It has been
said that the sporting public de
mands that I meet Jeffries. I am
quite willing to do so, and the only
conditions I impose are that we box
before the club offering the largest
purse, and that some reputable
sporting man be brought here from
the East to referee the contest.
While I prefer the National Club,
as it brought me out and haa
handled all my matches in this city,
I am nevertheless ready and willing:
to go before any club offering
better lpducoments.
As the National Club has offered
the best Inducements so far, I am
ready and willing to sign at any
time. If any other club offers
better inducements it will have my
sanction to make the match.
If Mr. Jeffries takes the same
businesslike view of the matter as
I do we should soon be signed.
Yours, etc.,
THOMAS J. SHARKEY.

"WORM THAT
DIETH NOT"
Father Yorke Portrays
the Remorse of
Conscience.
The Fundamental Truths That
Underlie Religion Vividly
Presented.
St. Mary's Cathedral Was Crowded
With a Vast Assemblage
to Hear the Lecture.
"The Worm That Dieth Not" was the
title of Father Yorke's sermon delivered
last evening in St. Marys Cathedral on
Van Ness avenue, and under this caption
the eminent divine developed in a master
ly style the argument of the remorse of
conscience. The cathedral was tilled to
Its utmost capacity. Every seat was oc
cupied.while tin alsleswere alsocrowded.
Following the brief devotional exercises
Father Yorke ascended the pulpit and in
substance spoke as follows:
We have entered upon this mission in order
to give ourselves time to think. It is hard tor
us u> put aside even for a brief space of time
the trifles that make up our lives and to bring
our minds to dwell upon the truths that under
lie religion. It is never a pleasant occupation
to collect our wondering thoughts^ The mind
la greatly distracted by the reading ot the
modern prints that are rilled with gossip, scan
dals, foolish alarms and lies without end. Tbua
â we lose the power to think for ourselves, but it
la necessary that we should give ourselves U>
eerlous thought no matter how unpleasant it
may be. The problem does not affect our
neighbors", it affects us.
We stand alone before God and by our own
hearts shall we be justified or condemned. The
point trom which we start Is the truth that
God has giver, us something to do. He is great
In his generosity to us and his one purpose is
to save our souls. We see uuon our right and
Jeft hands his warnings and his mercies, let
despite them we are free to fail or succeed.
It would he a relief to blot out the word fail
ure from our minds. The thought that flesh
and blood may fail is a hard one. God ia
?-ood. He will not ask of us forever. He died
or man and some day and somewhere lie will
bring us to himself. If we would know how
rood he Is we have only to read the life of hia
blessed son. For 1300 years has the story been
told and yet it Is not finisned. There was no
fnrm nf suffering that he did not alleviate, no
sorrow that he did not console. He came not
to call the just but sinners to repentance.
Tet he has taught us that th-re is a bound
beyond which even his mercy cannot go. De
spite all that he has done and would do there
are some who must fail. The ten foolish vir
gins that kept not their lamps supplied with
oil clamored to obtain entrance after the
bridegroom had closed the door. Theirs was
the remorse of conscience. Christ would
bring- us closer to himself If it need be only
to cast us out. for broader and broader does
he make the conditions of salvation only in
order to show us that failure is possible.
The king that made a marriage for his son
and thin found at the feast a guest that had
not on a wedding garment had him cast out.
This guest observed not the custom of the
feost. and while It was a little thing yet he
was lost. This illustrates the facts that we
must observe Gods laws and keep his com
mandments.
What does failure mean? The God of love
and mercy has taken oarc to tell us. His own
gracious "lips have again and again declared
what the lesson .rf failure means. The parable
of the unjust steward teaches us that God
Is full of me'-cy, but that we can provoke that
â wrath from which there is no escape. Odd
does not falter when he tells us of the tor
tures that be for those that set his words at
defiance. He likens his kingdom to a net that
â was let down Into the s^a and when it was
drawn up filled with fishes the good were kept
but the bad were thrown out. So shall it be
at the gTeat and final end.
There is no suffering or sacrifice too hard to
be endured upon this earth in order to escape
the wrath that is to come. These are the
words of him that died upon the cross to save
us. We have our Lord's word that failure is
possible, because we have our own free will
to choose either the good or the evil. We
know why he has sent us into the world and
we can defeat his wishes if we choose. If
â¢we reject God he will never force himself
upon us. We have eaten of the fruit of knowl
edge and there is no excuse.
When it is too late we shall be tortured with
a longing to love him, but it shall be turned
Into the bitterness of hate. Who can put Into
words all the gloom and despair In the word
failure? What can compensate the soul be
fore the Â«eat of Judgment that knows that all
If too late and that all is lost? Once the soul
is lost it is lost forever.
Eacb has his own life to live: each has his
own work to do. We each may fall, for salva
tion is guaranteed to none of us. Whether we
succeed or fail depends upon ourselves. We
are the keepers of our own souls: we are the
masters of our own fates. If we fail we alone
must suffer the penalty. Forget not the day of
Judgment.
MAYOR PHELAN TO BLAME.
The Snail-Like Gait of the Mission-
Street Cars a Source of Annoy
ance to Business Men.
A reduction in the schedule time of the
Mission-street electric cars from eight to
Blx miles an hour has been the source of ,
considerable annoyance to not only the j
laboring men whose time means money, :
but also to merchants and others living in i
the Mission. Heretofore the speed at â 
which the Mission, and for that matter
the Valencia and Howard street cars, ran i
â¢was considered a great advantage to |
those who patronized them in consequence
of the speed at which they traveled. The j
Mission-street line in particular was j
sought by the great majority of laboring
men and others by reason of the fact that
it only required a few minutes to reach j
their places of business or shops in which j
they worked from the furthermost part
of the line.
Now the speed of all lines running into
the Mission has been reduced from the
â¢^^t-mlle ciiD to that of six miles an
hour, and on this schedule of time the
people are dissatisfied and ask for a
restoration of the former schedule time.
Mr. Vining, the superintendent of the
Market-street combine, when seen by a
Call representative on the subject, said:
"The object of the company in running
Its cars Is to try to please the public.
This we have been doing by running our
cars at the rate of eight miles an hour.
And as a result the Mission-street line
monopolized almost all the traffic of the
Mission.
"The working men whose time meant
po much to them, as also clerks, and, for
that matter, business men, were well
satisfied with these arrangements. The
company likewise had no fault to find,
t)Ut on the contrary was well satisfied be
cause the public were satisfied.
"But at a time when everything was
running along smoothly between all par
ties, this company received a letter from
Mayor Phelan requesting us to establish
b. slower time schedule. This we have
ione, recognizing the fact that it is to be
supposed the Mayor of a city speaks for
the people. Now we hear nothing but
complaints from one end of the Mission td
the other over the creeping gait of the
cars. They are likened unto the cars of
years gone by, when the horsecars trav
eled at the rate of four miles an hour.
"If the public want us io go faster we
will, although it will entail more expense
to run cars at eight miles an hour than
Jt will to run them at six: yet we are
willing to please our patrons.
"For all of this inconvenience, which
we very much regret, the public must lay
the blame with the Mayor and Super
visors and not with the company.
"In addition to having one of the finest
climates in the world, San Francisco has
one of the best street car services in the
Vnited States, and it is the desire of this
company to keep it such. Had I my way
I would run the cable and electric oars at
a rate of ten miles an hour. It is none too
fast for the wide streets over which they
travel.
"If Mayor Phelan revokes his request
we will return to the eight-mile clip with
pleasure."
Alarmed the Neighbors.
Captain Nicholson, 3G32 Twenty-first
Btreet, had occasion to go In search of
Mrs. McDonald, 332 Clipper street, early
Tuesday morning, and meeting Policeman
Meredith asked him to help him in find-
Ing the house. They went to No. 228, oc
cupied by G. J. Attinger, and struck a
match to see the number. They had just
gone when Attinger opened a window and
fired two shots from a revolver, when
Meredith questioned him he Bald he
thought burglars were trying to break
Into the house. The police are afraid that
the Incident might be exaggerated into a

the exciting scenes that have been en
acted during its previous sessions. Re
ports were read and adopted without the

on the nature of a lova feast.

W. G. Hyde, who was charged by Con
rad Haub with unprofessional conduct,
answered through his attorney, B. S.
Gregory, denying the allegation.
The secretary of the board was in
structed to advertise for sealed bids for
the lease of the Clara-street school lot for
a period of ten years.
Some discussion was had over the re
port of the evening school committee,
which recommended dropping the names
of those teachers who were without
classes owing to the consolidation of the
evening schools from the department.
Dr. Carew thought the proper thing to
do was to place them on the substitute
list without salary, as it would give old
teachers a chance to earn a livelihood.
This course was adopted.
The report of the committee over which
the discussion was had is as follows:
That the high Bchool class in the Hamilton
Evening School be consolidated and W. W.
Damm. teacher of said class, be dropped from
the roll, and that the said Hamilton Evening
High School class be transferred to the Hum
boldt Evening High Bchool.

rey in the Horace Mann Evening School be
consolidated, and that Miss Kate Humphrey
be transferred to the day school list of teach-
ers.

School taught by C. L. Turner be consolidated,
and that Mr. Turner's name be dropped from
the roll of the department.
That Mrs. S. Wigands class In the Hum
bnidt Evening School be consolidated, and
that Mrs. Wlgand's name be dropped from
the roll of the department.

Eigncd list of da"y school teachers.

School.

"U'ebst^r, Mrs. L. Booth, J. F. Banks. Miss
E. Douglass, R. L. Mann and Miss C. B.
Nolan.
The following were elected reg
ular teachers in the department, having
served the term of probation required:
Miss Mary L. Meaney, Jefferson School;
Miss Josephine A. O'Neil, Star King Pri
mary ; Miss Pauline Dworzazek, Bernal
Primary School.
The Committee on Buildings and
Grounds recommended that the property
on The corner of Hoffmann avenue and
Twenty-iifth strec-t be rented for Rchool
purposes, but nfter a great deal of discus
sion It was laid over indefinitely.
This will be a disappointment to the
residents of Xoe Valley, as they are anx
ious to acquire a school house. The board
has- boon asked time and again for an ap
propriation, but without success. At pres
ent the children of that vicinity are scat
tered around the valley in rented rooms:
They f-ven proposed to the board that
they rent a building in order to keep the
children under one roof. Owing to the
Jack of funds the board will continue rent
ing rooms until there is enough money to
build a school house.

Last week the State Commissioners in
Lunacy met in this city and held what
they desired to be called "consultations,"
but the members of the press were ex
cluded. Since t-.eir return to their homes

to $3500 a year; the assistant physicians
$2000 and the seconu assistants $1300. Sal

ENTHUSIASTIC
FOR THE FESTIVAL
Meetings of Masons Yester
day Insure a Suc
cess.
The Committes on Donations En
larged and Active Work
Will Begin.
It now seems clear that the thirty-four
thousand Masonic families of California
intend making the coming Masonic fes
tival a sure success. All hearts are en
listed, all hands are joined in the good
work. The committee of the first import
ance is that on cash donations, a meet
ing: of which was held in the Grand Sec
retary's office at the Temple at 3 o'clock
yesterday. The chairman of the commit
tee, Lippman Sachs, called the meeting
to order. It was shown that the Grand
Master of the State of California had
issued a letter indorsing the work. Two
hundred and sixty acres of fertile land
have been obtained at Decoto and $60,000
is being expended in erecting suitable
buildings as a delightful home for the
widows and orphans of Masons of Cali
fornia. More money is needed, hence the
festival. By unanimous consent Timothy
Hopkins was elected Secretary and Ed
ward Newhall Vice-Chairman.
Lippman Sachs declared that it was the
first time in fifty years that the Masons
had joined together to hold a public
festival In order- to raise money. He said
that this charity was for a good cause
and should meet with the support of all
Masons and the sympathy of every Cal
ifornian. It was thought wise to enlarge
the committee on cash donations in order
that collections may be- made rapidly.
Timothy Hopkins was assigned with
John D. Spreckels to visit the banks. Real
estate men, hotels and restaurants will
see the smiling faces of Wendell Easton
and M. H. de Young. F. W. Van Sicklen
and J. Sussman will call on the mer
chants on the lower part of Market and
Front, streets. Lippman Sachs and Ed
ward Newhall will take Battery and San
some. Jacob Eppinger and Henry J.
Crocker were assigned to the Produce
Exchange. Colin M. Boyd will learn how
generous the Insurance men are. J. K.
C. Hobbs will talk to the lumber men.
Max Goldman is to go on the Stock Ex
change,
A. Sbarboro will consult with the Ital
ians. P. C. Hale, Adolph Roos and Mr.
Kohlberg were assigned to the rental dis
trict. The committee at large, to go to
whomsoever they please, are: Charles E.
Green, Colonel Isaac Trumbo, W. W.
Montague, S. W. Rosenthal and John F
Merrill.
It was intended to send Ed Coleman to
the most difficult places, but when it was
learned that he was one of the first to ex
pend $5000 of his own money for the home
a vote of thanks was tendered him for his
share of the work.
While this meeting was going: on n'earlv
three hundred of the ladles of Scottish
Rite were holding a meeting in St. John's
Hall. Mrs. Henry Cline acted as chair
man. Among the ladies present was Mrs.
Thomas H. Caswell, wife of the highest
Masonic dignitary in the world. As a Ma
son the Hon. Thomas H. Caswell ranks
superior to the Prince of "Wales. He is
the head of the Scottish Rite of the Sout
hern jurisdiction of the United States. From
this jurisdiction have come those of the
known world.
It was decided to fit up a Scottish Rite
booth. All the ladles present were enthu
siastic and promised good support.
The ladies of California Lodge held an
enthusiastic meeting in King Solomon's
Hall at the temple. Mrs. Ernest H. Hill
was chairman. Mrs. George Johnson, wife
of the grand secretary, to whom all Ma
sons turn for knowledge, was present. The
ladies decided to fit up their own booth.
Chairman Charles L. Paton of the exec
utive committee received hundreds of let
ters yesterday from the interior, assur
ing him of donations and a large at
tendance. He was kept at the temple from
early morning till late at night.
The ladies of California Commandery
will meet to-day at 2:30 o'clock, and the
ladies of Fidelity Lodge will meet at Â»
p. m, ax th& temple.

Four Favorites Brought Up In the
Rear â Lord Marmion Out of
Humor.
"With all his ingenuity and his fa
mous ironclad "prep," Ed Corrigan
seems fated never to win one of the big
distance stakes. Yesterday at Ingle
slde the J. F. Ullman stake at three
miles, worth $1900 to the winner, slipped
through the fingers of the Hawthorne
horseman. It was a "handicap and the
Corrigan entry, The Bachelor, carrying
118 pounds, was sent to the post favor-
ite, with Tod Sloan in the saddle. Ace,
weighted with 120, carried the money of
Tom Ryan and his friends, the gelding
closing in the market at 7 to 5. Lin
coln 1" with 115 up, and Sharon Lass, in
at 108, were the only other starter* For
two miles and a half The Bachelor,
swinging along out in front with a wet
sail, had things all his own way, with
Lincoln his closest company. Then I
there was a change. Conley, who had j
been taking matters easy with Ace, cut
loose and the gelding shot to the front,
and reeling off the last quarter as
though it were but the beginning of the
test, won by ten open lengths in S:2SU,
within five seconds of the world's rec- j
ord, held by the Australian horse Port- I
sea. The former Ingleside record was
5:42^i. The Bachelor, with his tongue i
hanging out and his legs wobbling like '
a drunken man-o'-warsman, just man- ,
aged to beat out Lincoln, which finished !
on three legs, a length for the center
piece of the prize.

It was another disastrous day for fa
vorites, Montgomery and Captan Rees
proving the only successful ones. Sloan
was again unable to land a winner.
Reina de Cuba seemp to be possessed
of a streak of yellow three leagues in
length. The Emperor of Norfolk filly
was sent to the post favorite for the
opening two-year-old scramble, and
quit like a dog when pressed. Native
Son, a 5 to 1 chance, ridden by Gray,
won easily from Sweet Cakes.
A select gathering of speed lined up
in the six-furlong run that followed,
with Montgomery ruling favorite at
odds of Bto 5. Magrane's horse made
all the running and won hard ridden
from Fortunate in 1:13%. Midlight, Tod
Sloan's mount, was a fair third.
The lon^ course steeplechase was a
farce. The Corrigan entry, Captain
Rees, was a 1 to 3 favorite* and won
at leisure. Esperance fenced well,
taking the place. McKenna on Hunts
man ran off the course once, eventually
finishing third. Eureka and Sky Blue,
two "crabs," should have remained at
home, both tumbling early.
Tod Sloan had the mount on Dona
tion in the mile and a sixteenth, and
the horse ran as though he had feasted
on bakery doughnuts that failed to di
gest, for he finished fourth, behind Paul
Pry, Lena, and the 5 to 1 shot, William
08. "Skeets" Martin on Paul Pry,
second choice, laid away second to Al
vin E to" the stretch, where he took
the lead, winning off from Lena.
Lord Marmion ruled a 9 to 10 favorite
for the six-furlong handicap, and show
ed beyond doubt that he is a coward.
Rated in third place behind Ed Gart
land and Daily Racing Form until
nearing the bend for home, he "dogged"
it badly when asked to respond, land
ing beyond the money. In a hard' drive
Clayton astride Glorlan led Ed Gart
land over the line a neck In 1:14 flat
TRACK ITEMS.
Mike Hennessy signed a contract with Ed
Tlpton yesterday to pilot the horses of Marcus
Daly on the Montana circuit this coming
season. Mike Is a hustling rider, ar.d on good
mounts can put up a ride with the best of
them.
Joe Plggott made his reappearance in the
saddle on Garnet Ferguson's filly Sweet Cakes
In the two-year-old event, riding with his old
time dash and determination. He was warmly
welcomed.
Some one. it was rumored, put In a claim
for Fortunate, but waited Just a trifle too long,
the fifteen minutes allowed by the clause hav
ing elapsed.
On Saturday last Montgomery was an an
nounced starter in the sprint won by Trolley.
The chestnut horse opened at 4, receded to 10,
and when the barrier was released refused to
break. Yesterday he was touted over the town,
and after being played from threes down to 8
to 5, broke away as though gpttlng left was
not In his line. Wise horse, that one.
Report had Potentate working very fast in
his morning trials, and though he had been on
the shelf for a long time there was a strong
play on him early in the betting, cutting the
price from 10 to 6. Conley handled him at the

he was merely an agent for some one who

A Search, of Two Decades
Rewarded at Stock
ton.
J. M. Leland Discovers His
Long-Lost Wife Among
tho Insane.
Though She Errod, Ho Loves Her
Still, and Says She Is Not
Demented.
After a search of twenty-two years for
an erring wife, J. M. Leland of this city
has found the girl whom he married in
Philadelphia in 1569 in the Stockton In
sane Asylum.
"She is not Insane," said the happy
discoverer of his long-lost companion last
night, "and I. shall soon have her out. . I
have searched for her ever since 1576.
That year she ran away with another
man. Though she is old and infirm, she
is still my legal wife. Frank Snook of
Oakland is her guardian, but that will
soon be changed. The woman has been
robbed and railroaded, and I propose to
see the thing through if the courts have
any power. She has a great deal >of
property."
The woman is In the asylum under the
name of Mrs. Clara Harrison, which
name she took after she left her husband.
She has about $50,000 worth of property in
Oakland and about an equal amount "in
cash, . according to Ned Foster, who is
making an active fight with her husband
to liberate her from the asylum. The
two, accompanied -by Attorney Joseph
Hawkins, and following the advice of B.
K. Collier, senior counsel in the case
spent yesterday in Oakland, where they
made an Investigation of the woman's af
fairs. â  ..
"I charge that a t>and of Oaklanders
and some San Franciscans got the woman
drunk in October, 1897," said her husband
last night, "and, after robbing her of her
diamonds and whatever they could get
ho.vi of, they railroaded her to the
asylum. I called, on her lately. She knew
me ,at once, after more than twenty-one
years' separation, and Is. perfectly willing
to return to me. The doctors will let her
out if I will care for her, and I shall do so
gladly, for I believe in the saying of
Shakespeare, ...at 'love is i not love that
alters when it alteration finds.' I shall be
only too glad to relieve Mr. Snook of the
guardianship of her property and to do
all in my power to make the remaining
years of her life happy." , g
Inquiries iat the Stockton asylum last
night developed the fact that the author
ities have decided to make a thorough in
vestigation of. the case before they re
lease M ,Â£\ Harrison. In answer to the
charge that the woman was railroaded to
the asylum Dr. Sanderson said" "The
woman s mania is . pronounced a"nd the
asylum is the only place for her She
appeals to us to save - her from beinc
murdered and to others she callsTherself
â¢Queen of the Masons",' <so that there is
no n rtoubt here as to her condition." **

woman save on legal proceedings or on

yÂ»leacU Â«twÂ«U Itlej*Â»a* "diujrcto'MfcTHE METROPOLIS OF NEVADA
RENO, March 29.â 1f all you know of :
Nevada has been learned from a car
â window-. It will surprise you to hear of :
the beauty and productiveness of the
Truckee Valley, in whose heart the city j
of Reno is located. Reno, in winter |
time, with the broad valley snugly en
circled by the Bnow-topped mountains,
with the lovely Truckoe River rushing
through on the way down from its
mountain source, and the exhilarating
Nevada air like a tonic to challenge
every drop of blood in one's veins,
might pose as the type at an ideal win
ter town. And Reno in summer, when
the valley smilesâ lt smiles in alfalfaâ
and the town is embowered in trees and
flowers, and the beautiful mountains
grow dim and hazy in the warm dis
tance, and the Truckee murmurs quietly
and Bleepily, is the most charming of
summer residences.
Reno's growth as a health and pleas
ure resort is the natural consequence of
the unusual combination of attractions
the fortunate city possesses. It is but
fourteen hours' ride from San Fran
cisco. It lies in a valley, but an ele
vated valley, where one may benefit by
the proximity of the mountains. Best
of all, it is situated in Nevada, and
â¢when a valley city possesses a Ne
vadan climate â the healthiest, the most
inspiring in the world â and a fertility
supposed to be exclusively CaJifornian,
she may well be inclined to throw a
golden goblet into the sea to placate
the Jealous gods.
Reno's golden goblet is her right to
fair treatment by the Central Pacific.
The fact that the goblet was not
thrown voluntarily isevidently unknown
to the aforesaid jealous gods, who, be
ing pagan and easily cheated, no doubt
suppose Coilis P. Huntington to be the
agent of Reno in the matter. At all
events that their natural resentment is
Btified is evidenced by Reno's accumu
lating wealth, by the growth of her
fame as a coming great city, by the
contentment of her people and their
trust in her future.
"We made a mistake thirty years
ago," said one of the foremost men in
Reno, "when we insisted upon being
known as producers of silver alone.
People have learned to think of Ne
vada as the place where silver was once
produced and sagebrush is now the sta
ple article. Since the depreciation in
silver Nevada has turned her attention
to the development of her other re
sources. Within a few years we have
made such advances in the develop
ment of our State's resources that we
might more properly be called a cattle
State, or a sheep State, or a dairy
State, or a farming State than a silver
State. And, of course, Reno is our nat
ural metropolis."
* â¢ â¢
The City of Reno was incorporated
by a special act of the Legislature of
the State of Nevada, approved March
8, 1597. It is the largest city on the line
of the Central Pacific Railroad between
Sacramento, California, and Ogden,
Utah, has had a steady and continu
ous growth ever since its inception and
is situated in the midst of the richest
agricultural and stock raising country
between the Sierra Nevada and the
Rocky Mountains. Its resources are
agricultural and pastoral rather than
those of mim-s. It is the terminus of
the V. and T. R. R.. extending south
with its connection 350 miles, and also
of the N. C. and O. R. R., extending
north eighty miles. It is the seat of
the State University, of the State Hos-
pital for Mental Diseases, and of the
f>tÂ«eÂ« AÂ«ricuitiira! Porf^ty. At the gen
eral election of I*s*6 it cast 1300 vot^s
and its present estimated population is
6500. Its assessed valuation in the
year 1597 was the sum of $1. 745,890
which was upon a low and very con
servative basis of valuation. Its total

The largest : heep owner in Nevada
values the 40,000 sheep he possesses at
a quarter of a million dollars. He is
enthusiastic over the prospects of Ne
vada in general and of P.eno in par
ticular.
"People do not realize," said he, "the
proportions that the sheep industry has
assumed here. Three years ago we
shipped from Reno 30,000 sheep to Chi
cago. The following year we shipped
60,000. And last year 100,000. Dealers
there were not anxious to buy of us at

and Omaha. Why? Simply because
Nevada mutton is better than any
raised anywhere cisc in the United
States. Our lambs are fatter because
the conditions make Nevada the btst
possible sheep-raising country. Many
of the cattle men here are quitting the
cattle business to invest in sheep. Tou
see Nevada is an ideal country for the
sheep man. The browse here can't be
equaled. We never suffer from drought.
When the winter comes the sheep come
down from the mountains anrt
feed on the deserts here. Why.
last winter we lost not 2 per cent of our
sheep. As to the wool, Nevada pro
duces wool that is particularly fine in
quality. The shrinkage is great, but
the 5.250,000 pounds of wool sent out of
Reno yearly are of a quality that is un
excelled. Three years ago we shipped
3000 sheep as far as Glasgow; shipped
them alive and the.y arrived in good
condition and were sold at top prices.
Nevada men will not accept anything
but top prices. And why should" they?
They are so situated, the climate of Ne
vada is such, its natural advantages as
a sheep-raising country are so great
that the Nevada sheep-raiser is in a
position to dictate terms â to all except
the railroad. You see Nevada is still
groaning under the discrimination
describing how the officer had shoved the
coupling pin into his face and used vile
! language to him. The defendant was
; asked by Mr. Hosmer to show the jury
: just how Seymour acted, and grasping
. the murderous weapon flourished it about
1 in much the same manner as he did the
j previous day in his direct examination.
The District Attorney, during the morn
! ing. had Hoff retell the incidents that oc
j curred at the Clute residence, 803 Guer
rero street, while he was there on the
day the murder was committed. Hoff said
that when he went up stairs Mrs. Clute
j apologized for disappointing him. but
said the confusion of moving had inter
fered with her settled plans. He was
questioned about the man he saw putting
down some matting and whom, he testi
fied Tuesday, he had left in the house.
Yr-ste relay Hoff contradicted himself and
. the man went down stairs.
To all of Hosmer's attempts to get him
to say whether the man returned to the
house. Hoff evaded a direct reply. Finally
the District Attorney asked:
"Are you willing to swear that the man
you saw go down stairs came back again
while you were there?"
"I am willing to swear to the truth."
"Answer my question. Are you willing
i to swear to that?"
"I am not."
That was the first flat contradiction of
his own testimony. Hoff then entertained
the jury by illustrating how he received
the cut on his hand, claiming it was
i caused by a tack in a carpet. Hosmer
I next asked him if he had ever stated to
i the Chief of Police that when he reached
| the house he found a short, thick set man

i guest.
"I never made such a statement," Hoff
declared with emphasis. Later on he de

' against us. Still within the last three
i years freight charges on sheep have
been reduced 50 per cent, so that the
sheep men are making money and other
j trades feel the effect of course.
"We need a larÂ°-e market. Only one
| fifth of our sheep are sent to San Fran
, Cisco. A little village of 300,000 people,
i like San Francisco, is too small to ab
! sorb the products of so great an in
dustry as has developed in Nevada.
There are 700,000 sheep on the hills of
Nevada to-day. The nutritious grasses
which our soil produces are capable of
feeding two and a half millions of
sheep.
"Reno owes her present prosperity â
and she will be still more benefited in
the future â to the fact that she is so
situated as to be the point from which
all shipping will be done.
"But the time will come when the
banks of the Truckee will be lined
with woolen mills. The only reason
that has not been done already is on
account of railroad rates. We made
arrangements with the railroads to re
duce the rate on wool from Reno to
Philadelphia from $2 B0 a hundred to
$1 50. The rates lasted just twenty-
four hours. The commission mer
chants of San Francisco wouldn't have
it. They want all our wool to be
shipped via San Francisco. So now
if we ship wool direct to Philadelphia
we pay $2 50 a hundred; if we send it
to San Francisco and from there to
Philadelphia it costs us $1 80.
"We arranged to have a scouring
mill, but we were informed that if by
scourins the wool we reduced its bulk
about two-thirds, the railroad would
maintain its profits by increasing the
rates COO per cent. We can send a
carload of potatoes for $27 50. If that
same car be filled with scoured wool
we must pay 3 cents a pound. But this
state of affairs will not, cannot last.
And that despite such discrimination
Nevada's sheep men are so prosperous
and the city of Reno is doing so much
business are the best evidences in the
world of the great resources of a State
that was supposed to be bankrupt when
its mines gave out.
"The sheep business is paying splend
idly, and as every lamb that's sold,
every sheep that's sheared pays its tax
in money spent or men employed in
Reno, the future of the city which re
lies not on this one industry-, but on
many, is assured."
tatingly repeated the harsh language
he had on direct examination charged
Seymour with using, and also described
how the officer shook him by the collar
and in other ways tried to intimidate him.
I When he illustrated how Seymour ap
i proached him with the coupling pin Hoff
I raised his voice to a high pitch.
Hosmer asked if Seymour spoke in that
tone.
"Yes; only louder."
"Can you show us how loud he spoke?"
"Oh, no; my lungs are so bad now that
I if I tried I would break down and prob
ably die right here."
After seme further questions about Bey
| mour's conduct Mr. Hosmer dismissed
| Hoff, and Attorney Schooler called John
I Donald, proprietor of the Lindell House,
1031 Howard street. The defense evidently
expected to show that at the hour of the
murder, between 4:30 and 5 o'clock on the
afternoon of December 15, Hoff was at
the house, but witness was not there at
the time, and when he attempted to tell
what Eugene Welton. a former employe
of hip. who is now in Alaska, had told
him about it. an objection shut him off.
H. Heneker, a grocer at Franklin
ajid McAllister streets, was next called,
and also attempted to give some hearsay
testimony, but an objection stopped him,
too. and the defense rested its case.
Mr. Hosmer then had Hoff's carpet bag
and the coupling pin weighed, the former
tipping the scales at 16M> pounds and the
later at 5 pounds, after which he called
Otto Heyneman. Chief Lees' official sten
ographer, in rebuttal. Witness with the
aid of his notes corroborated certain
statements attributed to Hoff during his
examination by the Chief, and which the
defendant a short time previously had
denied having made.
Hoff's testimony regarding Seymour's
rough treatment and harsh language was
read to witness and he positively denied
that the oflicer talked or acted in the

companied Hoff and the detective to SO3

at and I told him it was not necessary
for me to do any work as I was able to
live off the income from my property. He
then asked me other insolent questions,
his evident purpose being to get me to
create a disturbance, so that he could
place me under arrest.
"I kept my temper, as I did not want
to get mixed up in any quarrel with him
or with Thompson. He rudely kept his
hat on all the time he was in the house,
and conducted himself altogether in a
manner unbecoming a guardian of the
peace. I was glad when he went away,
as I was afraid of losing control of my
temper. At the time I thought of laying
a complaint before the Commissioners,
but decided for the sake of peace to let
it go. Now. however. I think I would be
doing wrong in not making the charge
against him."
After telling his story Scheel was ad

lodge it with the clerk of the Commis

of such expiration in the operation of
a street railroad, then the Board shall j
have power to lease such property to !
any person, company or corporation af- i

CHAPTEB XX.
Improvement of Streets.
SECTION 1. All streets, lanes, alleys,
places or courts in the City and Coun
ty, now open or dedicated or which
may hereafter be opened or dedicated
to public use, shall be deemed and held
to be open public streets, lanes, alleys,
places or courts, for the purposes of
this Chapter; and tacj Supervisors are
hereby empowered to fix the width
and grade thereof, and to order to be
done therein and thereon any and all
street work and street improvement
under the proceedings hereinafter de
scribed.
Sec. 2. Application for the doing of
any such work or improvement must
in the first instance, except where
otherwise provided in this Article, be
made in writing to the Board of Pub
lic Works; and if the expense thereof
is to be assessed upon private property,
the Board shall investigate the same;
and if it determine that such improve
ment is expedient, it shall so report to
the Supervisors; and the Supervisors
shall not order any such improvement
until the same has been recommended
by said Board. When the construction
of any sewer or drain shall involve a
cost of more than five dollars per lineal
foot for any block, it shall not be au
thorized except by an or< nance passedl
by the affirmative vote of not less thaiM
fourteen members of the Board of Su^
pervisors. ' If an application is made
for any work or improvement of which
the expense is to be paid by the City
and County, and the Board of Public
Works shall not approve of such appli
cation, it shall report to the Supervis
ors its reasons for such disapproval,
and the Supervisors may "then, after
having obtained from the Board of
Public Works an estimate of the ex
pense of said work or improvement,
by ordinance passed by the affirmative
vote of not less than fourteen members
of the Board of Supervisors, order the
doing of said work, or the making of
said improvement.
The Board of Public Work's may also,
except as herein prohibited, recommend
any improvement, the expense of which
is to be paid by the City and County,
though no application may have been
made therefor, and must make, with
said recommendation to the Supervis
ors, an estimate of the expense, and in
such case the Supervisors may order
the same done.
No street work or street Improve
ments of any kind shall be ordered to
be done by the Supervisors unless a
written recommendation to do the
same has been made to them by the
Board of Public Works, and all sucfi
recommendations shall be made mat
ters of record in the office of eaid
Board.
When the Board shall recommend any
work to be done on a street intersec
tion or crossing, where the streets do
not intersect each other at right angles,
it shall in each such case determine
what lots in the blocks adjacent to such
intersection or croc -ing will Le benefit
ed by said work, and shall cause a,
map to be made on which shall be
delineated the lots so to be benefited.
Such map shall be transmitted to the
Supervisors with said recommenda
tion.
Sec. 3. Before recommending to the
Supervisors the ordering of any work
or improvement, the expense of which,
or any part thereof, is to be assessed
upon private property, the Board of
Public Works shall pass a resolution of
its intention to recommend the same,
specifying the work to be recommend
ed, and shall fix a day when it shall
take final action upon said resolution.
Upon the passage thereof the Secre
tary of the Board shall forthwith, with
out any further authority, cause a copy
of said resolution to be posted conspic
uously for five days in the office of said
Secretary, and to be published for a
period of ten days (leg-al holidays ex
cepted) and cause a copy to be deposit
ed in the Post Office at the City and
County, with postage prepaid, address
ed to each person represented on the
Assessment Book of the City and
County for the next preceding fiscal
year as being owner of land liable to be
assessed for said improvement; but if
said lot stand on said book in the name
of unknown owners, such notice need
not be sent.
The Board shall also cause to be con
spicuously posted along the line of said
contemplated improvement, at point 3
not more than one hundred feet in dis
tance apart, notices, not less than
three in all, of the passage of said reso
lution. Each of said notices shall be
headed "Notice of Street Work" in let
ters of not less than two inches in
length, and shall in legible characters Â«
state the fact of the passage of saii }
resolution, its date, and, briefly, the
work or improvement proposed, and re
fer to the resolution of intention fjr
further particulars.
Sec. 4. The owners of a majority of
the frontage of the pro-, rty fronting
on said proposed work or improvement,
and, in case of a district, hose ownlnctnore than one-half of the superficial
area of the district, may make written
objections to the same within ten days
after the expiration of the time of the
publication of said resolution of i."?%*;i
tion, which objections shall be delivered
to the Secretary of the Board of Pubjic
Works, who shall endorse thereon the
date of its reception by him. Such ob
jections shall be a bar for six months
to any further proceedings in relation
to the doing of said work or making
said improvement, unless the owners of
the one-half or more of the frontage or
of the district, as aforesaid, shall
meanwhile petition for the same to be
done, and the same shall, after the ex
piration of said six months, be contin
ued under the resolution of intention
first passed if said Board shall deem
proper. If, however, the owners of at
least two-thirds of the property front
ing on said proposed work or improve
ment, and, in the case of a district
thoae owning at least two-thirds of the
superficial area of the district, shall
make written objections to the
same within said six months, no fur
ther proceedings shall be taken under
the aforesaid resolution of intention.
When the work <* Improvement pro
posed to be done is the construction of
sewers, manholes, culverts or cess
pools, and the objections thereto are
signed by the owners of a maiority of
the frontage or of the district as afore
said, the Board shall, at its next meet
ing, fix a time for hearing said objec
tions, not less than one week there
after. The Secretary shall thereupon
notify the persons making such objec
tions, by depositing a notice thereof in
the Post Office at the City and County
postage prepaid, and addressed to each
objector or his agent when he appears
for such objector. At the time speci
fied the Board shall hear the objections
urged, and pass upon the same, and its
decision shall be final and conclusive
and if said objections are overruled the
proceedings shall be continued as
though no objections had been made
At any time before the making of
the assessment as hereinafter provid
ed, all owners of lots of land liable to
assessment therein, who, after the first
publication of the aforesaid resolution
of intention, may feel aggrieved or
who may have objections to any pro
ceedings in relation to the performance
of tne work described in said resolu
tion, may file with the Secretary a pe
tition- ni remonstrance, wherein they
i-hall state in what respect they feel
aggrieved, or the proceedings to which
they object. Such petition or remon
strance shall be passed upon by the
Board, and its decision thereon shall
be final and conclusive.
Sec. 5. When the contemplated work
or improvement in the opinion of the
Board of Public Works is of more than
local or ordinary public benefit, it may
recommend to the Supervisors that the
expense of such work or improvement
t*> made chargeable upon a district,
and said Board shall in its res
olution of intention set out the district
benefited by said work or improvement
and to be assessed to pay the expense
thereof. Objections to the extent and
boundaries of the district of lands to
be benefited by said work or improve
ment may be made by any interested
party, in writing, within ten days af
ter the expiration of the time of pub
lication of the resolution of intention.
The Secretary of the Board shall lay
said objections before it and the Board
shall, at its next meeting, fix a time
for hearing said objections not less
than one week thereafter. The Secre
tary shall thereupon notify the persons
making such objections by depositing
a notice thereof in the Post Office at the
City and County, postage prepaid, ad
dressed to each objector. At the time
specified the Board shall hear the ob
jections urged and pass upon the same,
and if said objections are overruled, its
decision shall be final and conclusive
as to the extent and boundaries of the
district.
If the ODjections are sustained, the
Board shall proceed to set out another
district to the extent and boundaries
of which objections may be made and
a hearing had thereon as above pro
vided; and so on in like manner until
a district has been set out to the ex
tent and boundaries of which all ob
jections shall be overruled by the Board
â its decision in that behalf to be final
and conclusive; and thereupon the pro
ceedings shall continue the same as if
no objections had been made. In its
report to the Supervisors the Board
shall accompany its report with a dia
gram on which shall be delineated each
fc-parate lot, piece or parcel of land.
fcae area in square feet of each of such
lots, pieces or parcels of land, and the
relative location of the same to thÂ«
work or improvement proposed to be
done within the limits of the district.
Such diagram shall be certified to be
correct by the Secretary of the Board.
Sec. 6. When the work under any
contract shall have been completed, the
contractor shall make and file in the
office of the Board of Public Works
an affidavit to the effect that he haa
not entered into any private agree
ment, verbal or written, with any per
son liable to be assessed for said work,
or with any one on his behalf, to ac
cept a price from him less than the
price named in said contract, or to
make any rebate or deduction to him
from such price. Any such agreement
shall be deemed a fraud upon all per
sons liable to be assessed for such
work other than the property owners
who were parties to the agreement, and
shall make void,, as to such persons so
defrauded, any assessment made for
the work done under such contract; and
where there is more than one contractor
each contractor shall make such affi
davit.
Sec. 7. "When any work in or upon

provisions as to grading contained in
subdivision nine of this section.
Subdivision Elevenâ When the reso
lution of intention declares that the
expense of the work and improvement
is to be assessed upon a district, im
mediately after the contractor has ful
filled his contract to the satisfaction
of the Board of Public Works, or to
the satisfaction of the Supervisors on
appeal, the Board of Public Works
shall proceed to estimate upon the
lands, lots, or portions of lots within
said assessment district, as shown by
the diagram provided for in section five
of this Chapter, the benefits arising
from such work, and to be received
by each such lot, portion of such lot,
piece or subdivision of land, and

Sec. 10. If at any time there shall be
any street work or improvement done,
and none of the methods hereinbefore
provided are legally sufficient to au
thorize the Board of Public Works to
make an assessment to pay for the ex
pense thereof, then said Board shall,
before it passes a resolution of its in
tention to recommend the ordering of
said work or improvement, establish
by resolution a method by means of
which such assessment shall be made;
and on the completion of the work or
Improvement to the satisfaction of said
Board, or to the satisfaction of the
Supervisors on appeal, said Board shall
make an assessment to pay the ex
pense thereof according to the method
established by said resolution.
Sec. 11. In making all assessments
the Board of Public Works shall act
as a Board, and the assessment shall
be authenticated by the signatures of
all the members thereof.
Sec. 12. To said assessment shall be
attached a warrant which shall be
signed by the President of the Board
of Public Works and countersigned by
the Secretary thereof. Said warrant

form:
By virtue hereof the Board of Pub
lic Works of the City and County of
San Francisco, by the authority vested
in it, does authorize and empower

ceive the several assessments upon the
assessment and diagram hereto at
tached, and this shall be (his or their)
warrant for the same.
( D a te) . (Name of President of
Board of Public Works.)
Countersigned by (Name of Secre
tary of Board of Public Works.)
Said warrant, assessment and dia

the Board. When so recorded the sev
eral amounts assessed shall be a lien
upon the lands, lots, or portions of lots
assessed, respectively for the period of
two years from the date of said record
ing, unless sooner discharged; and
from and after the date of said record
ing of any warrant, assessment and
diagram, all persons interested in paid
atflK wsment shall be deemed to have no
tice ft the contents of the record
thereof.
After said warrant, assessment and
diagram are recorded, the same shall
hi delivered to the contractor, or his
agent or assigns, on demand, but not
until after the payment to the Board
of the incidental expenses not previ
ously paid by the contractor or his as
signs. By virtue of said warrant said
contractor, or his agents or assigns,
shall be authorized to demand and re
ceive the amount of the several assess
ments made to cover the sum diie for
the work specified in such contracts
and assessments.
When it shall appear by the final
judgment of any court in this State
having jurisdiction to render such judg
ment, that any suit brought to foreclose
the lien of any assessment for street
work made under this Chapter, or in
the recording' thereof, has been defeated
by reason of any defect, error, infor
mality, omission, irregularity, or iUe
ga'ity, thereof or therein, or in the re
turn on the warrant issued pursuant to
any such assessment, or in the record
ing of any such warrant, any person in
terested therein may, at any time with
in f.even months after the entry of said
final judgment, apply to the Board for
ar other assessment to be Issued in con
formity to law; and the Hoard shall,
within sixty days after the time of
said application, make and deliver to
said applicant a new assessmant, dia
gram and warrant in accordance with
law, and sign, record and authenticate
the same as above provided. Such as
sessment shall be a Hen upon the lots
of land set out therein for the period of
two years from the date of its record
ing, and suit may be brought to enforce
said lien as provided in this Chapter.
Should such final judgment be that of
the Superior Court for the City and
County and an appeal therefrom to the
Supreme Court of the State has been
taken, no such other assessment shall
be made until said appeal has been de
termined.
Sec. 13. The contractor or his as
signs, or some person on his or their
behalf, shall call upon the persons as
sessed, or their agents, if they can con- i
veniently be found, and demand pay
ment of the amount assessed to each, j
If any payment be made, the contrac- i
tor, his assigns, or some person on his
or their behalf, shall receipt the same
upon the assessment in the presence

the action, as a complete discharge of
the lien until the costs in the action
shall be refunded to the plaintiff.

ment upon the books of its office on
the payment to it of the amount of the
assessment with interest against any
lot or on the production to it of the
receipt of the party or his assigns to j
whom the assessment and -warrant |
were issued. If any contractor shall j
fail to return his warrant within the .
time and in the form provided in this ,
section he shall thenceforth have no
lien upon the property assessed; but if \
any warrant is lost, upon proof of such j
loss a duplicate may be issued, upon |
which a return may be made with the
same effect as if the original had been
so returned. After the return of the ;
assessment and warrant as aforesaid, I
all amounts remaining due thereon
shall draw^ interest at the rate of seven j
per centum per annum until paid.

ployed, or his agent or assignee, said
contractor, or his assignee, shall have
the right to sue such owner, tenant, or
occupant for the amount contracted to

said work and materials, and of the
right of the contractor to recover for
the same in such action. Said certifi
cate shall be recorded by the Board of
Public Works in a book kept by it in
the office for that purpose, properly in

pairs and restoration of the street
damaged in said construction, when
ever the Supervisors shall deem a

County as the Board shall determine
should be cleaned and sprinkled at the
public expense. Before causing notice
for such proposals to be published the

Extending and Changing the
Grade of Streets.
SECTION 1. When an application
shall be made to the Board of Publio
Works for the straightening, widening
or extending of any street, or for the
laying out, establishing or opening of
a new street, signed by the
owners of a majority of the
frontage of the lands upon the line
of said street, or proposed street, ana
such improvement requires the con
demnation of private property, and the
Board shall by resolution determine
that the improvement would be of pub
lic benefit, it shall make an estimate
of the expense of such improvement,
and determine by resolution the district
which will be affected by, and should
be assessed for, the expense of such im
provement. No proceedings shall ba
had upon the filing of such petition un
til after the persons signing the same
shall have deposited with the Secretary
of the Board an amount of money
which, as may be determined by the
Board, will be sufficient to defray all
the expense that may be incurred in
case the Supervisors shall not pass an
ordinance for said improvement.
Sec. 2. If within three months after
the passage of the resolution determin
ing such district, a majority of the
owners of the land within said district
who shall also be the owners of two
thirds of the superficial square feet of
the property included within said dis
trict, and of three-fourths in value of
said propertyâ including improvements
thereon â estimating said value accord
ing to the last preceding Assessment
Book of the City and County, shall
present to the Board a petition for said
improvement, verified by their oaths
and describing the lands of which they
are the owners, and showing the
amount at which the same was as
sessed upon the last preceding Assess
ment Book of the City and County, and
stating that they are the owners and
in possession of the lands named in said
petition, the Board shall pass a reso
lution of its intention to recommend
such improvement to the Supervisors,
and shall in such resolution specify a
day upon which it will hear any ob
jections that may be made to such im
provement.
Before passing such resolution of In
tention, the Board shall cause to be
prepared a map or diagram of the dis
trict affected by and to be assessed for
the expense of such improvement, upon
which shall be delineated the several
lots of land upon which said assess
ment is to be levied, and also the lots
of land which are to be taken for such
improvement, and showing the name of
the person to whom the said" lots were
assessed upon the last Assessment Book
1 of the City and County, together with
the amounts of such assessments.
Sec. 3. The Secretary of the Board
shall thereupon cause said resolution
of intention to be published for a pe
riod of thirty days, non-judicial days
excepted, and shall also cause a copy
of said resolution to be deposited, post
age prepaid, in the Post Office at the
City and County, addressed to each
person whose name is delineated upon
said map, at least ten days before the
day named for hearing objections
thereto.
Sec. 4. At any time before the day
fixed in such resolution for hearing ob
jections to such improvement, any per
son interested therein may file with the
Secretary of the Board his objections
thereto, briefly stating the grounds
thereof and the nature of his interest;
and upon the day fixed for hearing the
same, or some day to which the hear
ing thereof shall then be postponed,
the Board shall proceed to hear and
determine the sufficiency of any objec
tions which may have been filed.
Sec. 5. If the Board shall determine
that such objections are sufficient to
prevent a recommendation of the im
provement, it shall pass a resolution to
that effect, and no further proceedings
shall be had under said petition. If
no objections have been filed, or if the
Board shall determine that the objec
tions filed are insufficient, it may pass
a resolution recommending to the Su
pervisors said improvement, and in its
recommendation shall specially report
to the Supervisors whether in its opin
ion the land within the district speci
fied as affected by said improvement
will be benefited to the extent of the
expense of said improvement.
Sec. 6. If the Board shall pass a
resolution recommending said improve
ment, the Secretary shall forthwith
transmit to the Clerk of the Supervis
ors a copy of said resolution, together
with the petition, map, estimate of tho
expense of said improvement, and any
objections that may have been filed;
and the Supervisors shall at their first
regular meeting thereafter, or at any
meeting to which said hearing may
have been adjourned, pass upon said
recommendation, and may by resolu
tion adopt or reject the same. If said
recommendation is rejected no further
action shall be had thereon or upon
said petition. If the Supervisors shall
adopt said recommendation, they shall
within thirty days thereafter pass an
ordinance providing for said improve
ment, and may in said ordinance pre

Board of Public Works respecting tha
assessment and valuation to be made
by said Board, and providing for the
condemnation of said lands, and the
collection of said assessment, in addi
tion to, and not inconsistent with, the
rules herein prescribed, as to said Su
pervisors shall seem expedient. Upon
the passage of said ordinance the Clerk
of the Supervisors shall transmit a cer
tified copy thereof to the Board of Public
Works.
Sec. 7. Upon the receipt by the
Board of a certified copy of said ordi
nance the Board shall cause to be
made an accurate survey of the con
templated improvement, and a map
thereof, upon which shall be deline
ated each and every lot of land to be
taken or appropriated for the purposes
of the intended improvement, showing
its extent in feet and inches, and also
each and every lot of land within the
district determined to be affected by,
and which is to be assessed for, tha
cost and expense of said improvement.
After said survey and map are ma â¢Â«..,

ARTICLE XIL
ACQUISITION OF PUBLIC UTIL
ITIES.
It Is hereby declared to be the pur
pose and intention of the people of the
City and County that its public utilities
shall be gradually acquired and ulti
mately owned by the City and County.
To this end it is hereby ordained:
SECTION 1. Within one year from
the date upon which this Charter shall
go into effect, and at least every two
years thereafter until the object ex
pressed in this provision shall have
been fully attained, the Supervisors
must procure through the City Engi
neer plans and estimates of the actual
cost of the original construction and
completion by the City and County of
water works, gas works, electric light
works, steam, water or electric power
works, telephone lines, street railroads
and such other public utilities as thG
Supervisors or the people by petition to
the Board may designate.
In securing estimates of the original
cost of the construction and completion
of water works by the City and County,
the Supervisors must procure and place
on file plans and estimates of the cost
of obtaining from all of the several
available sources a sufficient and per
manent supply of good, pure water for
the City and County, in order that
propositions for the acquisition, con
struction and completion thereof, and
the incurring of municipal indebtedness
therefor, may be submitted to the elec
tors of the City and .County as herein
after set forth.
Sec. 2. After such plans and esti
mates shall have been procured and
filed, the Supervisors shall, at as early
a date as they may deem for the best
interests of the City and County, enter
into negotiations for the permanent ac
quisition by the City and County, by
original construction, condemnation or
purchase at such or any of said
public utilities as they may regard
most important to the City and. County
to be first acquired, and to formulate
and submit to the electors of the City
and County, at a special election, prop
ositions for the permanent acquisition
and ownership thereof.
Before submitting propositions to
the electors for the acquisition by orig
inal construction or condemnation, of
public utilities, the Supervisors must
solicit and consider offers for the sale
to the City and County of existing util
ities in order that the electors shall
have the benefit of acquiring the same
at the lowest possible cost thereof.
Sec. 3. When a petition or petitions
signed by electors of the City and
County equal in number to fifteen per
centum of all the votes cast at the last
preceding general election shall be pre
sented to the Supervisors, setting forth
that the signers thereof favor the ac
quisition by the City and County of any .
public utility, and requesting the
Board to prepare for submission to the
electors of the City and County, as
hereinafter provided, a proposition for
the acquisition of such utility, it shall
be the duty of the Board to immediate
ly take such steps or to enter into such
negotiations as will enable it to formu
late such a proposition for submission
to the electors as aforesaid. Such prop
osition shall be so formulated and com
pleted within six months from the date
of the filing of such petition. The Clerk
of the Supervisors must, immediately
upon the filing of the aforesaid petition
or petitions, after examining and veri
fying the signatures thereto, transmit
an authenticated copy thereof, without
the signatures, to the Board of Election
Commissioners, and another such copy
to the Mayor, together with a certifi
cate that the required number of signa
tures are appended to the original. The
Mayor shall also have the right to for
mulate and submit to the electors a
separate proposition from that formu
lated by the Supervisors for the acqui
sition of the utility named in said peti
tion. At the next municipal election af
ter the formulation of such proposi
tions by the Supervisors and the May
or, the Board of Election Commission
ers shall submit to the electors the two
alternative propositions. The proposi
tion receiving a majority of the votes
cast thereon shall be adopted; but in
case the votes cast in favor or Â©ota
1920
propositions shall not exceed one-half
the total number of votes cast therein,
both propositions shall be deemed re-
in this section shall be so
construed as to prohibit the Supervis
ors from responding to the aforesaid
netition of the electors requesting the
acquisition of any public utility by pro
ceeding at once, without the submission
of propositions to the electors as afore
said to pass an ordinance declaring its
determination to acquire the same a.
provided in section six of this Articie
and from proceeding thereafter to ac
quire the same in the manner herein
after provided. ..,
Se C 4 In case the cost of any public
utility sought to be acquired under the
provisions of this Article, can be paid
out of the annual revenues of the City
and County, in addition to the other
necessary expenditures thereof, it shall
be lawful to acquire the same by a ma
jority vote of the electors voting there
on at any special election. In submit
ting propositions to the electors for
such acquisition the Supervisors shall
specify in such proposition the cost of
the public utility, the proposed method
and manner of payment therefor, and
Submit to the electors the question
whether the same shall be acquired,
upon such terms.
In case however, the cost of such ,
public utility sought to be acquired
under the provisions of this Article J
shall so far exceed the annual revenues i
of the City and County, in addition to !
the other necessary expenditures there
of as to render it necessary to incur a
municipal bonded indebtedness for such
purpose, then the Supervisors, in sub- |
mining propositions to the electors for j
the acquisition thereof, shall specify i
therein the amount of the proposed
bonded indebtedness, the rate of inter- !
est thereon, and whether such bonded j
indebtedness shall be Incurred. At
least two-thirds of the electors voting
thereon at such election shall be neces
sary to secure such acquisition and to
warrant the issuance of municipal
bonds therefor, as hereinafter set forth.
Sec. 5. When the electors by vote
shall have determined, as hereinbefore
set forth, to acquire any public utility,
such action on the part of the electors
shall be equivalent to the passing of
the ordinance by the Supervisors de
daring such determination as set forth !
in section six of this Article, and the
Supervisors shall proceed without de
lay to pass an ordinance calling a
special election as required by section
seven of this Article.
Sec. 6. When the Supervisors shall de
termine that the public interest or ne
cessity demands the acquisition, con
struction or completion of any public
utility, the cost of which will be too
great to be paid out of the ordinary an
nual income and revenue of the City and
County, the Supervisors shall, by or
dinance, specifically declare such de
termination, and shall publish the same
for at least two weeks in the official
newspaper.
Sec. 7. At the m-xt regular meeting of
the Supervisors after the publication of
the ordinance declaring said deter- j
mination as above set forth, or at an
adjourned meeting thereof, or not less i
than two weeks nor more than four i
weeks after the electors by vote shall
have determined to acquire any public i
utility, the Supervisors by ordinance \
shall call a special election, at which
shall be submitted to the electors the
proposition of acquiring such public
utility, and of incurring a debt for the
acquisition of the same as set forth in
such ordinance. . No question oth*>r
than the acquisition of -such utility and ;
â¦he incurring of the indebtedness i
therefor shall be submitted at such
election.
Sec. 8. The ordinance calling such
special election shall recite the objects
and purposes for which the indebted
ness is proposed to be incurred, the es
timated cost of the proposed public
utility, the necessity for the acquisition
of the same, and that bonds of the City
and County shall issue for the payment
of the cost of the same as in such or
dinance set forth (if the proposition be
accepted by the electors), and shall fix
a day on which such special election
shall be held, the manner of holding
such election, and the Tnanrjr of voting
for or against incurring such indebted
ness. Such election shall be held as
provided by law for holding elections
in the City and County.
Pec. 9. Such ordinance shall be pub
lished daily for at least ten days in the
official newspaper. At the expiration
of said ten days the Supervisors shall
cause to be published daily for not less
than two weeks in the official newspa
per a notice of such special election.
Such notice shall specify the purpose
for which the indebtedness is to be in
curred, the number and character of
the bonds to be issued, the rate of in
terest to be paid, and the amount of
tax levy to be made for the payment
thereof.
Sec. 10. No indebtedness shall be in
curred for the acquisition of any public
utility under the provisions of this Ar
ticle, which, together with the existing
bonded indebtedness of the City and
County, shall exceed at any one time
fifteen per centum of the assessed value
of all real and personal property in the
City and County.
Sec. 11. The bonds issued under the
provisions of this Article shall be of the
character of bonds known as serials,
and shall be payable in lawful money
of the United States. The Supervisors
shall decide at the times of the issue
of the bonds in what lawful money of
the United States said bonds shall be
payable. Not less than one-fortieth
part of the whole amount of indebted
ness shall be paid each and every year,
on a day and at a place to be fixed by
the Supervisors, together with the in
terest on all sums unpaid at such date.
The bonds so issued shall be exempt
from all taxation for municipal pur
poses, and shall be issued in denomina
tions of not less than ten dollars nor
greater than one thousand dollars, and
preference in the sale and allotment
thereof shall be given to subscribers for
the smallest amounts and lowest de
nominations.
Said bonds must be payable on the
flay and at the place fixed therein, and j
with interest at the rate specified there
in, but such interest shall not exceed
four per centum per annum, payable '
annually, semi-annually or quarterly, j
as the Supervisors may determine. '
Such bonds, when issued, may be sold
by the Supervisors from time to time
as required, and in such quantities as j
they may determine, but the same must :
be sold for cash in lawful money of the
Tnited States as aforesaid to the high
est bidder at not less than par, after
having been advertised in the official
newspaper. They shall be sold under
sealed proposals, and the Supervisors
shall have the right to reject any or all
bids made for the purchase thereof.
The proceeds of such sales shall be
placed in the treasury to the credit of
the proper fund and shall be applied
exclusively to the purposes and objects
mentioned in the ordinance authorizing
their issue until such objects are fully
accomplished, after which, if any sur
plus remains, such surplus shall be
transferred to the General Fund.
Sec. 12. Such bonds shall be signed
by the Mayor and the Treasurer, and
shall be countersigned by the Auditor.
The coupons shall be numbered con
secutively and signed by the Treasurer,
and the bonds and coupons shall be
payable at the office of the Treasurer
Sec. 13. At the time of levying the
municipal tax and in the manner pro
vided for such tax levy, the Super
visors shall levy and collect annually
a tax sufficient to pay the annual in
terest on such bonds, and also the
proper aliquot part of the aggregate
amount of such indebtedness so in
curred. Such taxes shall be in addition
to all other taxes levied for municipal
purposes, and shall be collected at the
same time and in the same manner as
other municipal taxes are collected.
Sec. 14. A neglect or refusal on the
part of the Supervisors to comply with
the provisions of this Article shall con
atiuila cause for the removal from
' office of any member or members of the
Board guilty of such neglect or refusal.

BRITAIN'S TRADE.
According to the London Economist of March
12 the returns of England's foreign trade for
the month of February were not as encour
aging as expected. Exports of British produce
and manufactures showed a decline of Â£222,5G3,
a shrinkage in two months of 2.1 per cent. As
regards foodstuffs, wheat made a heavy con
tribution to the decline in imports, probably
due to comparatively high prices. The falling
off was p*oportonÂ»tely divided between the
Hea from the United States and Russia.
Imports of Hour have increased considerably,
the United States having obtained a firmer
hold on the milling industry.
According to the report furnished an Eastern
by an American who visited Birming
ham, England, nut long ago, the street trolleys
ir; that city at*e constructed of rails made in
Pittsburgh the cars were from Philadelphia, the
boilers frum Erie, the engines from Milwaukee
and the 'general electric fittings from Schenec

Isobars, or solid lines, connect points of equal
air pressure; isotherms, or dotted lines, equal
temperature. The word '"high" means high
barometric pressure and is usur.lly accompanied
by fair weather; "low" refers to low pres
sure and is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the Washington coast. When
the pressure is high in the interior and low
along the coast, and the isobars â  extend north
and south along the coast, rain is probable:
but when the "low" is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is Im
probable. With a "high" in the vicinity of
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Cali
fornia coast. warmer weather may be expected
In summer and colder weather in winter. The
reverse of these conditions will, produce an

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, March 30.â T0-day's transac- j
tions in stocks might fairly be termed a run- j
away bull market. The overwhelming convic- i
tion of ail operators on : Wall street seemed to !
be that a peaceful ; adjustment , of the contro
versy with Spain is probable. Any of the
minor developments of the day which seemed
to intradict this assumption or to threaten I
the defeat . of > this : outcome were persistently j
and confidentially ignored. There were reac- |
tions at times during the day, . but these were j
evidently due â¢ merely to realizing; sales by j
those who were content to take a large profit j
already assured. These realizing sales were j
absorbed Without at any time reducing the
level -of prices to last â  night's close or even
near "it, and 'the market several times rallied
to . near the " top figures of the day under | re
' ne'wed"*'buylng. . ' The day closed with the buy
! ing movement in lull force and prices near the j
! highest level.--. The ; day's net gains in the rail- ;
'â  road list ranged- from 1 to 3 points, and in the i
specialties gains of over five points in Sugar j
, and nearly seven points in Metropolitan Street
Railway were scored. Some of the shorts put j
out in Monday's bulge were covered to-day, and !
perhaps helped on the advance materially, : but i
the leading Influences in the > market was a :
rampant speculative buying movement. London i
was credited with being a large buyer here, !
but foreign exchange failed to. reflect the fact, j
! the tone of exchange being firm. This might |
be due to slightly easier time money, which '
i was no less significant of the prevailing con
; fidence in the peaceful outcome than the
strength in stocks. Prices of Americans in
London had risen '-ef ore the opening here,- but |
cabled reports said that this was due ; to buy- j
ing on New York orders. Spanish Government ;
bonds /also showed strength in Paris and Lon
don. Early . reports from Washington " that ;
' Spain had agreed to free *Cuba" for : $200,000,000 j
i Indemnity gave the first p-fwerful upward : im- i
petus to the market. The] underlying convic- ]
tion In financial circles wfi that whatever de- j
mands were made by the /united States = Spain
would accede to them and thus avert , hostili
ties. â ....: -pii wijiiiumi iiiiiftnvffflwawwrtffrrTniff

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. March 30.â The Evening Post's
London Â«, financial cablegram Bays: More
eagles were withdrawn from the Bank of Eng
land to-day for shipment to New York and
the bank has since raised the selling price
by a half penny to 76s Bd. There is a possi
bility also of a rise in the bonk rate soon.
After a dull opening the stock markets here
were practically booming to-day, being led by
Spanish 4s. Americans and Grand Trunk.
There is a tendency here again to buy Amer
icana and prices were above the New York
parity all day. The close in the street was a
trifle under the best.
There was a sharp rise In Kaffirs, first on the
rumors of the dpath of President Kruger then
on reports that the Deutsch Bank declined the
terms of a lojin to the Transvaal Govern
ment. Neither of the reports was confirmed
but the latter was credited in good quarters.
The satisfactory termination of the settle
ment has given fresh heart to the market, but
much liquidation must perforce occur.
Charles Hoare, the banker, died to-day.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKETS.
CHTCAGO, March 30.â Wheat displayed some
strength at the start and for about an hour
after there was quite a demand from shorts,
and not a little general buying. Following the
extreme weakness of yesterday's market here,
Liverpool showed surprising strength. It was
said that farmers had even sold trielr seed
Wheat. These were the factors Jn the opening
strength, starting July %c higher at S2VÂ£@B2%c.
For a few minutes the market displayed nerv
ousness, selling between g2%c and B29i@B2V&c.
Then the sharp advance which was taking
place in Wall street stocks and more quieting
reports as to the Cuban situation lent addi
tional strength to the market and started a
quiet buying movement which carried the price
up to 82% c. Here the market again sagged
under realizing by scalpers and some of the
first buyers, but the decline was limited to
about %c. For more than an hour the market
continued nervously within a narrow range un
der the operations of scalpers, but around the
noon hour thf continued strength of Wall
street and rumors of Impending Cabinet
changes Ftlffened the backbone of Wheat hold
ers and resulted In an advance in the price t<s
83V6c Closing prices at Liverpool and Paris
showed substantial advances. May Wheat was
little heard of. It sold at $1 03 shortly after the
opening, but quickly recovered to $1 04 and re
mained at that firure until near the close.
Some July buying by Leiter cut no small fig
ure in the advance in that future to f>3Vie,
though it was not on a large scale. The mar
ket held firm at around that price until the last
half hour, when realizing caused a decline to I
SlTic. The close was S2@B2V&c. May closed at
Com was quiet and steady. May closed a
shade higher.
oats were very quiet, business being mostly
of a scalping nature. May closed %c higher.
Provisions were strong early, but heavy real
izing did away with most of the advance. The
close was steady. May pork unchanged and
May lard and ribs each 2^c higher.

BOSTON WOOL MARKET.
BOSTON, March 3aâ The American Wool
and Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow of
the wool market: The wool market has been
so quiet that it may almost be said that there
has been no market. It looks at present, how
ever, as if a turn for the better has taken
place in our foreign relations, and that the
market would not experience such dullness as
has lately characterized It. Much of the dull
ness in the trade may be attributed to the
state of the money market. Very few manu
facturers have been seen in the market. An
other cause for the dullness is believed to be
the increased use of cotton, shoddy and other
substitutes.
The London sales report heavy buying by
France and Germany at advancing prices. No
sales have been made as yet for American ac
count. Prices' are almost purely nominal.
Practically no one cares to buy at the ex
isting quotations, but on the other hand scarce
ly any one will make any concessions.
The sales of the Â«oveek amount to 293,000
pounds domestic and 60.000 pounds foreign,
making a total of 3n3.000 against a total of
1.299,500 for the previous week, and a total of
12,839,500 for the corresponding week last year.

News of the Wonderful Find
Reached Here by Letter
Yesterday.
POSTAGE ON IT WAS $SO.
The New El Dorado Is Entirely
on American Terri
tory.
The first authentic news from the
Kotzebue Sound gold fields reached San
Francisco yesterday. It was written
at Rampart City last November, and
has thus taken over four months to get
here. It is from John Ross to J. A. Ral
ston of this city. The latter gentleman
has spent years in the Kotzebue Sound
country, and many a big hunt has he
had on the Kowak River. As the result
of one expedition he and his compan
ions secured the skins of 162 deer. Yet
he never dreamed of the untold millions
hid in its streams.
Mr. Ralston is well known In this
city, and numbers among his friends
Howard M. Hough, president of the
Union Fish Company; A. H. Herriman
of Herriman & Mills; Lawrence E. Noo
nan, president of the Lynde & Hough
Company, and Lieutenant George M.
'Stoney. whom he met cm several occa
sions when the latter was surveying
the Kotzebue Sound country- Ross, the
gold hunter who wrote the accompany
ing letter, is under many obligations to
Mr. Ralston, and naturally he sent him
the first news of his discovery. The
two men mentioned in the letter
reached Seattle some months ago, but
their little sack of $25,000 cut very little
figure when compared with the hun
dreds of thousands that were coming
from the Klondike.
Rumors of the wealth of the Kotze
bue Sound district have reached here
at different times, but nothing so defin
ite or startling as the present commu
nication. When Captain Cogan was on
his way back from the Arctic on the
"RICHEST SPOT ON EARTH"
Fac-simile of a Portion of the Letter Sent by John Ross
From Rampart City to J. (\. Ralston of This City.
steam whaler Thrasher he anchored in
Kotzebue Sound, and on his return
here traces of gold were found in the
mud on the anchor. The genial old
whaler also brought back some nug
gets with him which he had secured
from the natives. The Esquimaux told
him that they had secured the speci
mens a long way up the Kowak River,
and it was so plentiful that they could
scrape It up with a paddle.
In his letter Ross says:
"Two days after they left (pros
pectors who reached Seattle last Jan
uary) a native who had been further
up the stream hunting deer came
back with plenty of fresh meat and
a nugget that will weigh not less
than twenty ounces. I gave him tbe
last plug of tobacco I had for it. I
hated to part with the last plug, for
gold was more plenty now than to
bacco. We went on up the Creek.
The native led the way to a small
riffle, where he had found it, and we
commenced to work and found it in
such quantities as to make us almost
crazy, often getting ten ounces to the
pan. In ten days we washed out
$50,000."
Ross warns his friend to keep the mat
ter quiet, but in view of the fact that
seven or eight vessels are already on
the berth for Kotzebue Sound and more
are ready to follow, he came to the
conclusion that there was nothing to
be gained by keeping the matter secret.
Over a thousand gold-hunters have al
ready secured their passage on various
sailing vessels bound for the Kowak
River, and they will reach the new gold
fields Just as speedily as Messrs. Rals
ton* and Ross. In fact they will all ar
rive on the ground together, as Mr.
Ralston will go to St. Michael on the
first steamer to rejoin his friend, and
the barkentine Jane A. Falkinberg will
call at that place for them on her way
to Kotzebue Sound.
All of the eight sailing vessels bound
north are taking away stern-wheel
steamers, so, as before stated, all will
reach the head waters of the Kowak
River about the same time. Ross' let
ter to Mr. Ralston is as follows:
RAMPART CITY. November 16, 1597.
Friend Ralston: You will be surprised
if this letter reaches you. Remember
when I left you at St. Michael on the
27th of last June. You were bound for
Dawson, and all those at St. Michel
were very much excited when Clarence
Berry arrived there from Dawson with
so much dust. You left on the Bella on
the 28th of June, and on the following day
I left with the natives in a skin boat for
Port Clarence, that being as far as I
could induce the natives to go. From
there I got another native with a skin
boat to take me to Kotzebue Sound, but
I could not induce nim to go up the river
unless I gave him whisky. Not having
the requisite I was obliged to look for
some one else. Not having much trade in
their line, I was finally obliged to give
them what tobacco I had for our own use.
Jack Hayes had a gallon of alcohol and
some drugs, and with this we made about
four gallons of whisky. With this we
finally induced the natives to continue up
the Kufctick (.Kowak) River, as far as we
wanted to go.
Our original intention was to go as far
as Fort Cosmos, but before we got there
the Indians told us two white men had
gone up before us and were on a small
stream where they were getting plenty of
gold. We thought this too good to be
true, but concluded to follow on around
to where they were. Imagine our surprise
to find them with not less than $25,000,
which they had taken out in fifteen days.
The mosquitoes were nearly hell, and as
we had not much provisions, we started
in to do our best. Our fondest hopes were
more than realized, and in twenty days
we cleaned up with I should think about
$50,000.
This was about August 20, and our
two friends were thinking of coming
down the river in the hopes of getting to
St. Michael before the last boat would
leave for San Francisco. They started,
but we concluded to stay ten days longer
and take our chances in getting out. Two
days after they left a native who had
been further up the stream hunting deer
came back with plenty of fresh meat and
a nugget that will weigh not less than
twenty ounces. I gave him the last plug
of tobacco I had for it. I hated to part
with the last plug, for gold was more
plenty now than tobacco. We went on up.
the creek. The native led the way to a
small riffle where he fnunu it, ami wo
commenced work and found it in such
quantities as to make us almost crazy,
often getting ten ounces to the pan. In
ten days we washed out $50,000. Oh, how
we hated to leave. We had only fifty
pounds of flour left, and very little tea
or sugar, so we started down to the
mouth of the river, and when we got
there the weather was getting cold. Ice
was making fast in the Kubuck, and the
natives told us we couiv* not go down un
til it froze up. They also told us that it
was as near to go to the Yukon, as to the
mouth of the river, and they agreed to go
with us if we gave them some tobacco
and whisky when we reached the Yukon.
Here we stayed with them until October
15, when we started coming by the way
of Zanes Pass and reaching Mulatto after
fifteen days" traveling. There we got some
flour and a little tea from a half-breed
trader, and I also got some tobacco for
the natives, but no whisky. The natives
would not go any further, so I stayed
there until November 10, when hearing
that there were plenty of supplies at
Rampart City we started for this place,
which we reached in five days.
Skink Miller told me you went down
the river on the J. J. Healey. so I sup
pose you are in San Francisco now. I
Jbojie so and I JaojyÂ© this letter will reach
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 31, 1898.
you. I intend to stop here until the riv.er
opens and then go down to bt. Michael
and purchase supplies from the Commer
cial Company, or else go to San Fran
cisco. I have plenty of dust now to
charter a vessel with and take back all
the supplies I want. If you should re
ceive this letter wait in the city until I
arrive, as I will be down on the first boat
from St. Michael, and we will return as
soon as we can charter a boat and pur
chase supplies.
Hoping this will reach you, I send it
with the mail that is going to leave here
to-morrow. I am paying $50 postage on
it, but that is nothing, as I have better
ground than any on the Klondike, as you
will say when you Bee it. Kotzebue is
the richest spot on earth.
Hoping this will find you all well, I re
main, your friend, JOHN ROSS.
In talking about the Kotzebue Sound
country yesterday Mr. Ralston said:
"There need never be any fear of a
famine there, as deer are plentiful and
fish can be caught in abundance all the
year round. In winter you can break a
hole In the ice and catch enough salmon
and trout for a meal in ten minutes.
Ross is right about the mosquitoes.
They are something awful, and the only
thing that will withstand them is a
closely woven wire mask. Just fancy
my tramping and hunting over that
country for years and never finding an
ounce of gold. The Kowak River is far
easier to navigate than the Yukon, and
there Is all the timber that will be
wanted for a generation on its banks.
Ross is a level-headed fellow, and I am
inclined to think with him that 'Kotze
bue is the richest spot on earth.' "
NARROW ESCAPE OF THE PIONEER.
When the schooner got outside the wind fell light and she drifted in close to the Cliff House, where she an
chored. When the fog lifted an attempt was made to sail out from the dangerous position, but the Pioneer only
drifted closer in near the ocean beach life-saving station. The station sent a boat to her assistance, and the Re
liance brought another from Fort Point, but no assistance was required.

BACK FROM PARIS.
Artist Altmann Home Again With
the Results of Five Years'
Labor.
Aaron Altmann, the young student of
the Mark Hopkins' Institute of Art. who
left this city five years ago to study art In
Paris, returned home yesterday morning
a full-fledged painter.
While absent from this city Altmann
studied for a little over a year in the
Julien Academy in Paris. Later he se
cured admission to the Ecole de Beaux
Arts, where he remained for over two
years. Here he worked directly under
the direction of Gerome and had the ad
vantage of association with some of the
best painters in France. After over three
years of hard study in the schools of
Paris Altmann took a studio for himself
and studied in the galleries and also
worked in the studio of Caroius Duran.
The last few months of his stay abroad
he spent in travel, visiting all of the great
art centers and exhibiting his work
wherever opportunity presented itself. 'At
the Munich exhibition he received an hon
orable mention and also sold one of his
pictures.
Altmann has confined himself almost
entirely to figure work and painting por
traits, but has also produced a number of
outdoor paintings that have called forth
favorable comment.
He brings with him a large collection of
drawings, paintings and studies executed
while abroad. These pictures all show
great strength and conscientious study.
They are good in both drawing and color
and have a strong aspect of individuality.

NEARLY WENT
ON THE BEACH
Lifeboats and a Tug Went
to the Assistance of
the Pioneer.
Trouble Between Union and
Non-Union Sailors on the
Water Front.
Ships Columbia and St. Nich
olas Had Their Non-Union
Crews TÂ«ken Off.
The schooner Pioneer, hound for Grays
Harbor, had a narrow escape from going
ashore early yesterday morning. When
she got out past Point I^obos the wind
died away to a calm, and do what he
would the cnptain could not prevent his
vessel from drifting close in to the Cliff
House. Seeing that she was in danger of
going ashore he ordered the anchor let
go, and the vessel swuuf to it for
three or four hours until the fog lifted.
A light land breeze came up, the anchor
was hove up and an attempt was made to
get to sea. The wind was not strong
enough to carry the vessel out, however,
and soon she was close in again, this time
off the Ocean Beach Life-saving Station.
The crew of the li'e ; rraxs;-ti inking the
vessel in danger, telephoned to the
Spreckels Towboat Company for a tug,
and then launching their own boat went
to the assistance of the crew of the Pio
neer. The captain of the schooner told
them that his vessel was in no danger,
but the lifeboat remained by her never
theless until the tug Reliance hove in
sight.
On his way to the supposed wreck Cap
tain Brokaw stopped at the Fort Point
Life-saving Station and explained the sit
uation. Ine lifeboat was launched and
its crew got on board the tug. It was
towed around to the ocean beach, ' when
Captain Brokaw found that his assistance
wa*> not required. During the afternoon a
strong offshore breeze came up and the
Pioneer finally made a good otting.
There was lots of fun on the water front
yesterday, ;md it looked like the oid days
when union men and â¢"scabs'" had a pas
sage at arms every hour in the twenty
lour. The sailors' union is irymg to keep
wages on vessels gonyc to tne canneries
up lo $45 a month, uut The Packers' Asso
ciation is not willing to pay inort; man
*40 a montn. Twelve me:iha.a been shipped
on the Columbia lying at L'nion-sireet
wharf, but a detachment from the union
descendea on the vessel and drove them
all ashore. The sailors were driven all
over, the city, and not one of the shipping
masters could nnd them again. Sergeant
Mahoney ajid a squad of police were sent
trom the iiurbor police station, but in or
der to avoid any trouble tne vessel was
moved into the stream and a new crew
will be put on board of her there.
Captain I'niitt; of the ship Spartan had
the same trouble with his men. He, how
ever, secured a full crew at the lower
rate of wages an>l got away yesterday
The snip St. Nicholas had also to go
into the strtum to ship Â±i.er crew. Dur
ing the afternoon ihe union men descend
ea upon her and got every man to go
ashore. Set ing thru there was no chance
whatever vi. obtaining men while the
vessel was at the wharf the captain had
her towed out Into the stream and an
chored off Folsorn-sireet wharf. Before
getting away froni the wharf there was
a free fight among the Chinese who are
going up to work in the canneries. No
one seemed to know what was the cause
of the trouble, but rice and slippers were
very much in evidence. It was just about
mealtime, and the Chinese threw their
pans containing rice at each other, and
then each Mongol took off a slipper and
began belaboring his neighbor over the
head with the heel of it. In the meantime
every one of them was coughing and
screaming at the same time, and never
was such a pandemonium seen on the
decks of the St. Nicholas before. It took
nearly an hour to quiet down the Chinese
and then it was found that the whole
trouble arose over the fact that one
coolie had taken more than his fair al
lowance of rice.
The schooner Free Trade finally got
away on her voyage in search of "an isl
and of gold" yesterday afternoon. She
was to have got away with her aristo
cratic passengers last Tuesday morning,
but the law, which is no respecter of
persons, stepped in and delayed the de
parture. Peter Petersen, the watchman,
and James Garrett got into a .squabble
over the ship's stores and Garrett struck
Petersen over the head with a marlin
spike. A few minutes before the vessel
left Main-street wharf Petersen arrived
on the scene with a policeman and Gar
rett was arested on a charge of battery.
The matter was finahy settled before
, : Judge Conlan, but before the schooner
I could get away, John Gilbert, the mate,
; and Peter Petersen, the watchman, libeled
I her for wages which they alleged to be
due them. This necessitated the vessel
remaining in port over night. During the
night the boys around Meiggs wharf paid
the schooner a visit and got away with
' two sucking pigs and a crate of chickens
that were intended for the table of the
aristocratic gold-hunters during the voy
age. When Captain Moore came ashore
yesterday he determined that nobody
should get on board to serve any more
warrants during his absence, so he armed
j his wife with a Winchester and left her
on guard. Nobody more alarming than
a boatman came anywhere near the ves
sel. When Captain Moore returned he at
once put up sail and started for Alaska.

Copper River, another is going to Cooks
Inlet and the third is to survey an all-
American route via the Valdez Pass to
the headwaters of Copper River. A tele
gram from Captain Lord of the Valencia
says that the Valdez Pass is now in excel
lent condition, and the gold-hunters
are coming and going over it continu
ously.
The anxiety felt over the long passage
of the schooner Nellie G. Thurstnn from
New York has been set at rest. She
passed out of the Straits of Magellan in
company with the schooner Thomas S.
Negus, and the latter has now been in
port for nearly a fortnight. Oscar Mik
kelsen, mate of the Negus, has received a
letter from Callao. which says that the
Thurston was last seen in the vicinity of
the Galapagos Islands. She may now,
therefore, be expected at any timo. The
Thurston has on board a party of nine
teen pold-hunters bound for the Klondike.
The barkentine Catherine Sudden istob*
built up and put on the berth for Kotz
ebue Sound. At the present time shÂ« is
unloading a cargo of lumber, but when
that is discharged the worn of building
a large deckhouse will be at once begun.
First-class accommodation for lfiO pas
sengers will be provided, and as Captain
Fred Green, the old Arctic whaler, is go
ing in command, the passage to the
mouth of the Kowak River is sure to be
made in quick time. A stern-wheel
steamer to carry the gold-hunters up the
Kowak River is to be taken along.

TRYING TO DOWN
THE POOLROOMS
Supervisors and Racetrack
Officials Meet in Con
ference.
Horsemen Object to Restrictions
Matter Put Over lor One
Week.
The conference of the Special Committee
on Racing of the Board of Supervisors
and the officers of the Ingleside track,
held yesterday at the City Hall, came to
nothing. It was called to discuss Super
visor Clinton's proposed ordinance to re
strict racing to forty-eight days in each
year.
Supervisor Clinton stated that, while
he was in favor of racing as a sport, he
was not in favor of poolrooms, and had
drawn up the ordinance with a view of
stamping out the dens.
Supervisor Smith suggested that it
would be probably impossible to amend
the order so that the poolrooms could be
closed.
President Androus of the Jockey Club
said that the poolrooms would handle
the racing at other tracks and that re
stricting racing would not have the de
sired result.
Vice-President Crocker stated that the
track gave employment to 1000 men and
boys and that it annually put into circu
lation, over one and a half million dollars.
Supervisor Clinton claimed that many
young boys had been ruined by tne gam
bling feature Â«onnected with racing, and
Mr. Crocker retorted that it was no worse
than stock gambling.
"Two wrongs don't make a right," said
Supervisor Clinton, "and I think this
matter is too large to be settled at one
meeting. I move that the committee hold
another session one week from to-day,
when we can hear more testimony on the
subject." The matter was then put over
for a week.

With Him.
Declare That They Have
Been "Dreyiused" Out
of Their Positions.
The Collector Refuses to Con
sider It Because It Is
Not True. â¢
HE ACTED ON A CIRCULAR.
Took Evidence and Did Not Allow
the Accused to Bo Present at
the Investigation.
The ghosts of Lennon and Zemansky,
the dismissed deputies of the Internal
Revenue Department of this district,
will not down. Yesterday afternoon they
presented themselves at the office of
Collector Lynch and filed with him a
typewritten protest against the manner
of their taking off. They ask in the
document that the Collector make re
paration for the wrong which they
claim he has done them, and that this
reparation take the form of a reconsid
eration of his recommendation of dis
missal.
Their complaint in brief Is that the
Collector "jobbed" them by holding a
secret investigation in their case and by
not giving them an opportunity of fac
ing their accusers or of being present
at the investigation. Mr. Lynch, after
reading the protest, informed the ex
deputies that he would not receive It
or send it to Washington for the rea
son that certain statements therein con
tained were false, and that he would
be put In the awkward position of sendr
ing to the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue a document accompanied by a
statement by him that the matters con
tained in the protest were not truth
ful. He said that if Messrs. Lennon
and Zemansky would amend their pro-,
test he would consider it.
The following is a copy of the pro
test:
John C. Lynch Esq., Collector of In
ternal Revenue, San Francisco â Dear Sir-
Under date of March 24, 1898, you notified
me that the termination of my appoint
ment as Deputy Collector of Internal
Revenue took effect from and after said
date.
I have also been notified that such no
tion was taken upon your recommenda
tion.
I respectfully ask that you recall the

recommendation of dismissal, and that
the matter of my suspension be reopenec
for further consideration for the following
reasons: ,
L You acknowledge that your conclu
sions in the matter were based upon am
davits submitted to you by Louis Loupe,
late Chief Deputy: W. H. Dillard. mes
senger in your office, and B. M. Thomas,
a subordinate in Revenue Agent Thrash
er's office. That said affidavits came Into
your possession after the filing of our
answers to the original charges, and that
you gave me no opportunity to know of.
submission of said affidavits, I only learn
ing of the same through the colums of
The Call, a newspaper published in San
Francisco on the 24th inst., in a reputed
interview held with you in relation to
these charges.
2. If 1 had had an opportunity to meet
and rebut these affidavits I could have
done so successfully, ana your recom
mendation would have been in my favor
and not against me.
3. I desire to say that the entire pro
ceedings, from the time of the filing of
the charges against me to the time of my
"termination" notice, have been irregular,
unjust and malicious and contrary to the
civil service regulations, under which I
have rights, and that I have, to use a
modern expression, been "Dreyfused" out
of a position in your office. Respectfully,
ED F. LENNON.
Mr. Lynch was asked later in the day
as to his reasons for having denied
Lennon and Zemansky a hearing at the
investigation and as to why he had not
invited them to be present. The Col
lector replied that he had acted under
authority of department circular No.
480, which required that the accused
should be furnished with copies of tha
written charges against them and re
quested to file a written answer w!thin
ten clays. That proceeding had been
folio ,ved to the letter he said.
"The circular," continued Mr. Lynch,
"does not require the Collector to hayÂ«
a trial. He is simply to forward his
recommendations. I did not give an
interview to The Call and I toll Mr.
Lc-r.non that I wished him to amend hig
paper because I was not responsible
for what was said in The Call, and I
did not want to be obliged to send his
report to Washington and to send a
communication with it to the effect that
it was not true." Up to a late hour
last night Mr. Lennon had not amended
his report and it is not believed that
he will. He says that he and Zemansky
are insisting upon their rights and that
they do not propose to be "star-cham
bered" and "Dreyfused" out of their
positions under the stigma of charges
of misconduct.
