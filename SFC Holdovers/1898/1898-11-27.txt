AT twenty-one minutes past 9
o'clock yesterday morning slip
No. 4 of the Union Iron Works
gave birth to the new and latest
terror of the American navy.
Amid the thunder of barking guns and
the piercing shrieks of thousandsÂ»of
steam whistles, amid the shouts of a
loyal populace and with a wealth of
the national colors fluttering on the
crisp morning breeze, the Wisconsin,
the fairest of Uncle Sam's proud
daughters, made her debut to the na
tions of the world â and was at home to
her sister ships on the blue waters of
San Francisco Bay.
A beautiful woman stood sponsor for
the mountain frame of warlike iron and
steel. A little gulden-haired, rosy
cheeked, laughing child placed her
chubby fingers on a small, white but
ton. Then In answer to the electric
current the Wisconsin accepted her
mission of life, her duty of war or
peace, and started down the incline like
Borne frightened deer. Slowly at first,
until her fair sponsor cast against her
Bteel breast the christening wine, say-
Ing: "I name thee "Wisconsin." Realiz
ing her freedpm was her own, and as if
In acknowledgment of the proud feel-
Ing, the battleship leaped forward to
the water, the Joyous waves came surg
ing up to meet and welcome her, and
out into the glorious wealth of sun
shine, out onto the breast of the
fathomless deep the armored terror
plunged â the coast line battleship

launched from the yards of the Union
Iron "Works. ;;;^:
At the first signs of approaching day
the Potrero began to awaken. Yester
day was a gTeat day in the Potrero, for
the men who gave to our navy the his
tory-making Oregon were to send forth
from the same slip on which was built
that historic battleship another mon
ster creation of their brawn and
muscie. For nineteen months and fif
teen days the smoke-begrimed, â work
hardened toilers of the Union Iron
"Works had been patiently building the
new battleship. Slowly they had seen
the latest object of their pride and
adoration grow from a mass of iron
ribs and frames into definite shape and
form. From its conception on Febru
ary 11, IS&7, the eyes of the Potrero had
rested fondly, lovingly on the Wiscon
sin. The hopes and prayers of the Po
trero had gone daily into the very body
of the ship and had been built into
her from keel to top deck. Yesterday
was the day when the Wisconsin was
to say good-by to those who had given
her life and existence, and while a feel
ing of sadness oppressed the heart of
the Potrero at the thought of the part
ing, yet the Potrero to a single man.
and for that matter to its oldest gaffer
and youngest child, was determined
that the Wisconsin's natal day should
be a success.
At 6 o'clock the busy sounds of prep
aration disturbed the morning stillness.
An army of men began the work of
sawing and cutting away the blocks
from underneath the ship, while others
hurried around her decks to see that
all was right and in order.
President Irving M. Scott, proud,
happy and smiling, was himself early
on the scene. He hurried here and
there. He seemed to be everywhere at
once, giving orders and directions. His
personal supervision was lent to the
smallest detail. Before the gates were
opened Captain Spillane and Lieuten
ants Anderson and Hanna arrived with
a small army of police. From begin
ning to end they kept perfect order and
handled the 7000 people that were ad
mitted within the shipyards in a most I
thorough and efficient manner. Be- I
sides the thousands that came by in
vitation there was a host of curious
humanity along the water's edge, while
the roof of every house in the Potrero
was covered with people. Every point I
GOVERNOR-ELECT CAGE
WELCOMES WISCONStN
At the banquet last evening at the Palace Hotel priven to the rtistln- I
grulshed visiting representatives of the Badger State, Governor-elect Henry -
T. Gage of California made the following response to the toast of the "State â 
of California":
Mr. Toastmaster, Ladies and Gentlemen and Fellow-citizens of â 
the State of Wisconsin: California with her great agricultural, min
ing, manufacturing, industrial and commercial Interests, with her â 
cheering hopes and enlarged possibilities for the future in consequence â 
of the annexation of the Hawaiian Islands, an accomplished fact; and â¢
the inevitable further extension of our territory In the near future, â 
the resuit of the indomitable courage of our soldiers and sailors In the â 
late war. bids her fellow-citizens from Wisconsin a most cordial and â 
hospitable welcome. .
It is our greatest glory that we are a part of the Indestructible i
Union; that we share in Its achievements "by sea and by land; that â 
its flag is the sacred and common property of all; and that in defense â 
of Its honor all are ready to sacrifice fortune and life. " {
The grand battleship that to-day for the first time embraced the I
waves, constructed by the skill of California mechanics, bears the I
proud name of the great State of Wisconsin, and in her future ca- i
reer in defense of the flag and the Union she will be another bond be- â 
tween the two great States. j
Ladies and gentlemen from Wisconsin, we thank you for this visit, i
and our best wishes go with you to your far-off home. May you, your â 
State and all you love have peace, prosperity and happiness to the )
latest generation. 4

The police kept the crowd from the

with patriotic bunting. Shortly before
the arrival of the guests of honor the
Marine band from the receiving ship

of sailors and marines from the Wheel

officers in two lines on either side of the
Wisconsin's prow to keep back the
crowd.- --v"- V; '^V'"'v ' â  -
At 8:45 o'clock the Union Iron Works
tug Millen Griffith arrived with, the
Wisconsin contingent and specially in- ;
vited guests on board. They were es
corted to the stand by Mr. Scott.
First came Miss Elizabeth Stephen
son, with Senator J. L. Mitchell. The
fair sponsor wore a dream of a gown â
a Parisian creation made especially for
the occasion. The skirt was of cadet ;
blue broadcloth. The shirt waist was
pink silk trimmed with duchesse lace, j
while the Jacket was of the same mate- \
rial as the skirt, trimmed with blue j
velvet and lace applique, with white \
satin facing. The exquisite impression I
of the gown was heightened. In its ef- j
feet by the high sable collar and the i
black velvet hat, from which waved i
graceful white and black plumes. Next j
came Governor-elect Gage and Mrs. j
Gage, with their little daughter Lv- !
cille. She was a perfect wonder of j
childish beauty In a fluffy little dress of |
some soft blue material, while from un- i
der her big white hat her wealth of
golden curls fell gracefully over her
shoulders.
Following came Lieutenant Governor
Emil Bench of Wisconsin, with the fol
lowing distinguished members of the
party from his State, among whom was
Govenor ScofieÂ»a's staff:

The army was represented by Major
General Merriam and his aid. Lieuten
ant Bennett, while Commodore Watson
and the officers of the Franklin, Adams
and Wheeling were present on the part
of the American navy. The officers of
the Italian cruiser Etna were also
among the guests, as were Captains
Sakmo, Sakurai and Wodagaki of the
Japanese navy. Mayor Phelan was
present on behalf of the city. There
were also the Union Iron Works offi
cials and many swell girls on the stand.
Promptly at 9:05 the brief ceremonies
began. This consisted of the presenta
tion to the Wisconsin of , her colors,
which were received by Commodore
Watson.
About the 26th of October Mrs. M. H.
Mayberry, teacher of sewing connected
with the manual training department
of the Irving M. Scott School, suggest
ed that the children under her charge >
make a set of colors for the battleship <
Wisconsin. Her patriotic sentiments
were enthusiastically seconded by the
principal. Miss M. M. Murphy, and her
entire corps of assistants.
This work of love and patriotism was
begun on the 26th of October of the
present year, 1898.
The flag and Union Jack are made in
accordance with the specifications and
rules of the Navy Department of the j
United States Government. The flag is I
27 feet long by 14 feet wide. The Union I
Jack is 10 feet 10 inches by 7 feet 9 I
inches. One hundred and seventy-three !
yards of bunting were used in the con- j
struction of these colors.
The children engaged In the work of
making the colors were from eleven
reguiar sewing classes, In all about 300
pupils.
The homes of these children are In
the vicinity of the Union Iron Works,
where they have seen the mighty form
of the Wisconsin rising, as it were, out
of the sea. The parents of many of
them wielded the hammers that sang
out the strokes that told of the mighty
work their strong and sinewy arms
have done for the nation.
The furled flag was suspended from
the bowsprit. Miss Margaret Duff,
Miss Jeanette Draper and Master
Frank Dixon, all pupils of the Irving
Scott School, held the cords that were
to release the colors. These pupils had
won this honor by their meritorious
work- In presenting the colors Miss
Duff addressed Commodore Watson.
She said:
"Hon. Commodore Watson, Repre
sentatives of the Army and Navy, Hon.
Irving M. Scott and friends:
"The high honor of presenting the
colors to the great battleship Wiscon
sin has been accorded to me by the
teachers and pupils of the Irving Scott
School.
"The high honor conferred is en
hanced by the fact that this is the only
occasion when pupils of our public
schools have made a flag with their
own little hands, gladdened by the
thought that the United States Govern
ment w"ould accept their work.
"Through the kindness of Hon. Irv
ing M. Scott, who has now a world
wide reputation as a promoter and
builder of great battleships, we are per
mitted to offer this token of our love
and patriotism.
"Our parents have wielded the ham
mers, driven the rivets and otherwise
builded this noble ship from keel to
turret. Now she is ready to displace
the waters of our erlorious bay: to greet
the sun as she rides triumphantly on
her mission of humanity; to demon
strate to all nations of the earth that
she. as well as her noble sisters, the
Oregon, the Olympia, the Charleston,
Monterey and others, great ships built
here at the Union Iron Works, can de
fend our nation's honor and use her
power to battle in the cause of hu
manity.
"Go forth, magnificent "Wisconsin;
dip your noble bow to-day in the waters
of San Francisco Bay; sail fearlessly
over the seas; show your magnificent
lines in the ports of all the great na
tions of the world. Let your message
be one of peace, and Instead of a fig
urehead of the God of Battle, let there
be emblazoned in words of living light.
'We come In the name of the living

God, for the nation's honor; we come
in tha cause of humanity.'
"And now, Hon. Commodore Watson,
we beg that you accept these colors
which we have carefully made accord
ing to the specifications laid down by
the Navy Department for the construc
tion of such flags. Three hundred
children have put in every stitch with
the utmost care, so I am sure you will
find upon examination that our labor
has not been in vain.
"Under the guiding hand of our sew
ing teacher, Mrs. M. H. Mayberry of
the manual training department of our
school, we have worked with patience,
with most patriotic devotion, to crown
the work of many of our parents, who
have bent their energies to complete
this noble ship."
'â¢All is finished.
And at length has come the bridal day of
beauty and of strength.
To-day the vessel shall be launched.
With fleecy clouds the sky is blanched.
And o'er the bay
Slowly in all hiÃ splendor's light
The great sun rises to behold the eight.
The ocean old, centuries old.
Strong aa youth, and as uncontrolled
Paces restless to and fro
Up and down the sands of gold.
His beating heart is not at rest.
And far and wide with ceaseless flow
His beard of snow
Heaves with the heaving of his breast.
He waits Impatient for his bride.
There she stands, with her foot upon the sands)
Decked with flags and streamers gay.
In honor of her marriage day.
Her snow white signals fluttering, blending
Round her like a veil descending
Keady to be the bride of the gray old sea."
At the conclusion of the graceful
speech Commodore Watson in a few
patriotic words accepted the Wis
consin on behalf of her captain. The
three children pulled the cords and
Old Glory floated on the breeze amid
the cheers from the multitude. Then
Mayor Phelan read Clara Iza Price's
eloquent ode to the battleship pub
lished in yesterday's issue and the su
preme moment had come.
The bottle of wine was lowered from
the vessel's pr-w by streamers of the
national colors. Miss Stephenson
grasped it firmly and smiled. Then
little Lucille Gage touched the button.
Slowly at first, so slow in fact that it
scarcely seemed to move at all, tha
huge ship, snail-like, went forward.
"She's off:" was the cry from tha
waiting thousands.
A soft, firm, sweet voice said, "I
christen thee Wisconsin."
There was a crash of glass and the
white effervescing wine dampened the
iron prow of the mighty vessel and ran
in sparkling rivulets down her sides.
Forward, like some animal that feels
the lash, the Wisconsin leapt, and then
with a rush and a roar the largest bat
tleship ever constructed on this coast
sped down the incline into the waters
of the bay and into history.
PLEASURE CRAFT DOT
WATERS OF THE BAY
Yachts and Excursion Steamers
Gaily Bedecked Carry Throngs
to the Launching.
The launching- was witnessed from
afar by thousands of spectators. The
shore line was sharply defined by
them, while the adjoining hillsides wore
also the vantage point from which
great throngs viewed the moving spec
tacle. Every class of seagoing craft
was represented in the bay about the
great shipbuilding yard, from which so
many notable fighting machines have
been sent forth to do battle under Old
Glory-
Anchored just off the iron works waa
a jaunty yacht, the white sides and gay
bunting of which showed out in strong
relief against the dull, leaden sky. The
early morning was cold and cheerless,
and those viewing the launching from
the bay were all closely muffled in furs
and overcoats. ,
The pleasure boats and those carry
ing excursionists were early on the
scene, forming a solid semi-circle about
the course over which the battleship
was to glide after leaving the ways on
which she was built. In addition to the
Government boats in the vicinity, ail
the tugs and available steamers were
pressed into service. Dainty racing
skiffs scraped noses with stout tugs,
while launches, both steam and gaso
line, flitted about lending life and ac
tion to the color scheme. The most
novel of all the craft was a bicycle boat
built catamaran fashion and propelled
by two men.
There was but little delay. So soon
as the tide served and the launching
party were in their allotted places thÂ«
signal was given and the huge hulk
began to move. To the spectators on,
the water this movement was scarcely
perceptible at first. Soon a shout went
up, only to be swallowed in the shriek
ing of steam whistles, punctuated by
the booming of cannon. The guns of
the Italian cruiser Etna and the Mari
etta belched forth a salute as a wel
come to the latest of Uncle Sam's fight
ing machines.
The Wisconsin went down into the
sunless sea as gracefully as a swan.
She gained impetus as she advanced
and cut through the water like a racing
yacht. Usually the large boats cast up
a great wave, which tosses the pleasure
craft about and then breaks high on
the shore, dampening the enthusiasm
of the more venturesome spectators.
There was none of this yesterday.
After she entered the water a slight
swell disturbed the bosom of the bay.
leaving its surface as nlacid aa a mill
pond.
After the din subsided all eyes were
turned on the Wisconsin. Her graceful2
lines are apparent, although she sits
high out of the water and is utterly de
void of aÂ«l the guns and fittings which
will later on add to her grim beauty.
A concerted movement toward home
was then commenced by the gayly dec
orated pleasure craft. The majority of
"them passed the Italian cruiser Etna,
affording a good view of the foreigners.
Naval militiamen from the Marion
Tind "Jackies" from the Marietta picked
their way among the steamers, while
the band" of the Marietta lent tone to
the occasion, the musicians being all
garbed in red.
Alexander Harrison, the celebrated
marine painter, attended the launching
as the guest of W. G. Stafford. Mr.
Stafford and his wife entertained a
large party on the tug Reliance, among
others E. M. Greenway, E. H. Hamil
ton and family and Rolla V. Watt.

DAY CLOSES WITH
BANQUET AND BALL
Glasses Click to the Never
Ending Success of the \
Giant Ship.
An epoch in the history of Califor
niaâthe ceremony surrounding the
launchine of the .^reat battleship Wis
consinâwas closed last night with
banquet and ball at the Palace Hotel.
The American dining room in the
Palace was ablaze with light and bril
liant with the flowers of garden and
field. On the south txvrr flags, the
stars and stripes, were draped, and
above them an eaerle. in one talon an
olive branch, emblematic of peace, in
the other a spear, emblematic of war.
Shortly after 7 o'clock two hundred
guests of Irving M. Scott entered the
room and were seated. To the right of
the president of the Union Iron Works
Miss Stephenson took her place, the
place of honor. At the same table were
1 Governor-elect Henry T. Gage,
or Mitchell of Wiscojjfln, M. M.
Estee. Captain Cotton. Mayor Phelan,
Senator Sawyer of Wisconsin, Mrs.
Henry T. Gage. Lieutenant Governor
Baensch of Wisconsin, Francis G.
Newlanda of Nevada, ex-Governor
Btephenson of Wisconsin, General
Barnes and Congressman Julius Kahn.
Irving M. Scott first addressed the
gathering. In part he said:
Ladies .and Gentlemen: I am happy to
night to have the privilege to extend a
welcome, to the people of the Badger
State and as to the ship I can only say
that I hope she will carry the flag ana
maintain its honor as have the other gal
ins of the United States navy.
Mr. Scott then read a telegram from
Secretary Whitney saying "Good luck
to the ship and good luck to you," and
another from Governor Budo" who con
gratulated the Union Iron Works and
the notables from Wisconsin on the
successful launch of the vessel. Mr.
Scott then continued regarding the
launch of the giant vessel.
The launch was a complete success, in
fact it was the must successful in every
way we ever had. considering the- size of
the battleship. The fact that It went
without a hitch or a iar is due entirely to
Mr. Dickey, the prince of launchers, who
in this case outdid himself, having the
ly for launching nine minutes
time tixi-i] on July 7 last. This
nrost important lounch. In fact sec
ond to none in the United States, as the
ns larger than the Oregon
and the â¢ >ntra t rails for one knot more
tte pride of the people of
Wisconsin whq came across the country
to witness the ship name<l in honor of
their State nls.-> added lesi to the occa
whlch is a most memorable one.
Lieutenant Governor Baensch then re
sponded to the toast, ''State of Wiscon
sin." In part he said:
"The people of Wisconsin hail with de
light the launching Ot a namesake which
be part and parcel of the brightest,
bravest, most < !fi<-i.-ni navy in the world.
Half-way across the continent they have
sent this delegation to escort one of Wis
'a daughters fair that sho might
christ< n the ship with all rtue form and
nony, while from a million hearts
c<>n!Â»-s the sincere cheer of 'Good luck,'
<) with an earnest prayer that the
vast strength and power of this modern
engine of war will ma&e ft a preserver
and guaranteer of universal peace."
Governor Henry T. Gage was next
presented to the gathering by Mr. Scott.
â His response to the toast "State of
California" was roundly applauded by
the guests, and Senator Mitchell of j
"Wisconsin was introduced. He said:
Once ranged with our warships the j
"Wisconsin will have to look lively to keep
abreast of her mates, for the American
navy, man to man, is superior to any
navy in the world, as recent events have
shown. The American navy is the most
efficient, not because of the ships and
their armament, but because its officers
are selected with more care and more
thoroughly trained than those of any oth
er nation. We hear a good deal about
the "man behind the gun," but the officer
behind "the man behind the gun" is who
does the business. They are taken, not
from the aristocracyâ because we have
. none; not from a favored class, but from
.the people-^-the robust people of the whole
"land.
before we take leave of our ship we
leave wishes for her welfare. May she
never pound on the pitiless rocks. " May
she never be pursued by the wild hunts
man of the storm. When she drops slow
ly into her last haven, may she never
have had the necessity for firing a shot
â  save in practice or of burning powder
save in salute.
At the conclusion of Senator Mitchell's
address th<- following toasts were re
sponded to: General W. H. L. Barnes,
"The Occasion"; Senator George C.
Perkins, "A Greater Navy"; Miss Olsen,
poem; Edward P. Hackett, presenta
tion: Mayor James D. Phelan, "Our
Guests"; Horace G. Platt, "First
Rivet."
Mr. Scott announced at the conclu
sion of the toast on the "First Rivet"
that a ball was next in order in the
hotel parlors. Host and guests alike
then returned to the parlors and
mingled in the mazes of the dance until
the mldnlgat hour came, then the fes
tivities ceased.
Doubled His Sentence.
Frank Smith, a petty larceny thief, com
pleted a sentence of three month on Fri
day for petty larceny. That afternoon he
Went to the stationary store at 641 Valen
cia street, where he committed his pre
vious theft, and stole an inkwell. Judge
Conlan yesterday sent him back to the
County Jail for six months.

Mad Act of a Liquor-
Crazed Clerk.
ARRESTEDAFTER A HOT CHASE
ATTEMPTED TO ROB A HYDE
STREET RESIDENCE.
Charles Johnson Locked Up in the
City Prison on a Charge of an
Attempt to Commit
Burglary.
A respectable appearing man wtth a
large diamond in his shirt front was ar
rested at an early hour yesterday morn
ing by Policemen Collins and Skein and
charged with an attempt to commit bur
glary. He is accused of trying to break
into the residence of Y. L. Madrid at 40S
Hyde Etreet. At the City Prison he gave
his name as Charles Johnson and his
occupation as that of a clerk.
Shortly after 3 o'clock yesterday morn
ing a servant girl in the employ of Mad
rid was awakened by Johnson trying to
pry open the rear window. She imme
diately awakened her employer, who,
donning his clothes, went in search
of the intruder.
He saw Johnson leaving the premises,
but thinking he was armed, determined to
follow him until he met a policeman. Af
ter following Johnson Policeman Skein
was found and the feilow was caught
after a hot chase. He was searched by
Officers Skein and Collins, who found
an open knife with a six-inch blade in hia
P Madrid positively identified Johnson as
the man he had seen leaving the prem
ises When asked why he carried such
a murderous weapon Johnson rather tes
tily declared that it was none of the offl
cer's business. He was then taken back
to Uie house and confronted by the
servant girt. She was unable to identify
him, as she could not see his face on ac
count of the darkness.
Notwithstanding his protestations of in
nocence he was taken to the City Prison
and charged with an attempt to commit
burglary. In trying to force an entrance
to the house Johnson used tne knife
which was found in his possession. He
first cut the sash of the window and then
proceeded to remove the pane. Evidently
b.-cuming rattled he thrust his elbow
through "a lower pane, breaking it, and
causing the servant to scream with fright.
After being locked up Johnston admitted
that he had broken the window, but de
nied having intended to enter the house.
"Liquor is the cause of it all," he lugu
briously remarked. "I must have been
crazy to have committed such a crime. 1
Several of his friends on learning of his
arrest hunted up Judge Conla.n. who, be
coming convinced that Johnson did not
Intend to rob the house, issued an order
for his release on his own recognizance.
Johnson, it is said, is well connected. It
is not likely that Madrid will prosecute
him. ___

SPAIN TO SELL HER
REMAINING ISLANDS
Ready to Part With Those in Oceanica and
May Even Dispose of the
Canary Group.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York Herald. Copyrighted, 1808,
by Jtmei Gordon Bennett.
MADRID, Nov. 26.â There is unaer consideration a pian ior me
selling of all of the remaining Spanish islands in Oceanica. This will
be formulated soon after the ratification of peace. It is considered by
.those who advocate this course that in view of the great demand for
coaling stations in the Far East by all nations, good prices could be
obtained for property of trifling value under the Spanish regime.
This colonial liquidation would include Marianos and the Carolines.
In certain circles I have even heard that Spain might possibly part
with the Canaries.
ACCEPTANCE BY
SPAIN IS NOW
EXPECTED SOON
Time Limit Expires
Monday.
! ORIGINAL DEMANDS HOLD
NON-COMPLIANCE TO BE FOL
LOWED BY AN ULTIMATUM.
Action of Spanish Commissioners,
However, Indicates They Are
Only Trying to Soften Their
Country's Fall.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Nov. 26.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: As a result of advices received
from Judge Day and the counter-propo
j sitions made to the American Commis
i sioners yesterday the administration
! expects that on Monday the Spanish
I Commissioners will formally announce
'â  their acceptance of the American terms
j respecting the Philippines. It was re-
Iterated by a Cabinet officer to-day
that notwithstanding the propositions
made by Spain Judge Day and his as
sistants had been instructed to closely
adhere to their original demands, and
it is presumed that by this time Senor
Rios has been so informed.
It is believed in official circles that
further propositions will be submitted
befure Monday, but it can be stated
positively that they will be rejected,
and that Spain must answer definitely.
Non-compliancy will be followed by
the submission of an ultimatum requir
ing immediate action as desired by this
Government or an interruption of ne
gotiations and resumption of hostili
ties. Naturally the authorities are
anxious over the outcome, but the ac
tion o-f the Spanish Commissioners in
making the propositions outlined indi
cates to their mind that the Madrid
Government is prepared to yield and is
only endeavoring to isoften her fall as
much as possible by making better
terms than these offered.
SPAIN'S REPLY WILL
BE MADE MONDAY
But the Spanish Commission. Claims
Not to Know the Nature
of It.
PARIS, Nov. 26.â The Spanish Peace
Commission this evening does not
know what will be the terms of the
answer to the American tender of $20.
000,000 for a treaty cession of the Phil
ippines. Senor Montero Rios, president
of the commission, will himself write
Spain's final reply, presumably upon
the lines approved by the Madrid Gov
ernment, but as yet he has not formu
lated a sentence thereof.
Up to this evening the Madrid Gov
ernment has not instructed Its com
mission here to reject the United
States' offers. Some tentative instruc
tions have been received from Madrid,
but to-day Senor Montero Rios tele
graphed to Madrid for a construction
of them or a clearer light thereon, and
the commission is now awaiting a re
pjy.
Spain will not ask for time beyond
Monday. She will then meet the Amer
icans and make a conclusive reply.
Speculation continues rife here as to
the acceptance or refusal of the Ameri
can terms, but a majority of those who
are in any degree able to Judge believe
that Spain will yield and the American
commissioners expect that a treaty will
be signed.
SPANISH CABINET
OBLIGED TO ACCEDE
Revision of the Treaties of Commerce
and Special Treaty for the Phil
ippines in Order.
MADRID. Nov. 26.â The Impartial
to-day says: "The Spanish Govern
ment thought that after the signing of
the peace treaty friendly relations be
tween the United States and Spain
would be resumed and the Govern
ments would negotiate directly on mat
ters of secondary importance. But the
United States' last note requests that
the Paris Commissioners be empowered
to arrange a revision of the treaties of
commerce and a special treaty for the
Philippines, as well as to settle other
questions. The Spanish Cabinet is
obliged to accede to the request, and
therefore several additional sessions
will be necessary after Monday. The
instructions sent to M. Montero Rios
order him again to jnsist that the abso
lute rights of Spain in the Philippines
should be maintained in accordance
with the very clear text of the protocol.
However, the Government declares that
Senor Montero Rios will sisrn the peace
treaty without reserve, as its signa
ture under protest will deprive the
treaty of a definite character and
leave matters as bad as they are now,
and we have Ministerial authority for
saying that the Government desires
the speediest settlement of these mat
ters, as otherwise they may result in
grave dangers In Spain."
DEMAND FOR CESSION
OF SULU ARCHIPELAGO
Spain Has Sovereignty Over These
Islands, Notwithstanding As
sertions of Germans.
LONDON, Nov. 26.â Special dis
patches from Madrid say Senor Mon
tero Rios, the president of the Spanish
Peace Commission, has informed his
Government that the Americans de
mand the cession of the Sulu archi
pelago. Further advices from Madrid
say the Spanish Cabinet has decided
to instruct its commlsslonerg, after the
peace treaty is signed, to ask for a re
vision of the treaties existing before
the war.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 26.â The asser
tions made in some of the German
newspapers that Bismarck, in 1877, had
established Germany's rights to the
Sulu Islands, forming the southern por
tion of the Philippine group, have led to
the making of an investigation into the
history of the negotiations of that date
relative to the islands in the East. It
has been found that in the year named
England, Germany and Spain having
conflicting claims to various islands, a
tripartite arrangement was entered
into by the terms of which Spain
yielded her claim to the northern part
of the Island of Borneo, and guaranteed
to England and Germany liberal rights
of trade and fisheries in the Sulu
Islands. The treaty, however, con
cedes absolutely Spain's sovereignty
over the islands, so there is no ob
struction to their cession to the United
States on that score.
SCHLEY RELATES TWO
CURIOUS INCIDENTS
At a Banquet Given in His Honor He
Tells of Strange Emotions of
Telepathy.
NEW YORK, Nov. 26.â Rear Admiral
Schley was the guest of honor at a
banquet given to-night by the Lotus
Club at their magnificent home on
Fifth avc-nue. Seated at the boar^l to
greet him were gentlemen prominent
In the American-Spanish war and well
known in professional and commercial
circles. The banquet room of the club
was richly decorated with cut flowers,
palms and potted plants, and immedi
ately behind the admiral's chair were
draped the stars and stripes, with the
flag which the admiral brought back
from Santiago.
Seated at the guests' table were
Bishop Potter, Admiral Erben, Captain
Si^U-e, Channcey M. Depew, Colonel
Robert G. lngersoll, Key. Mlnott F.
Savage, Captain A. T. Mahan and Ad
miral Schley.
When Admiral Schley arose to speak
he was accorded a tremendous ovation.
In the course of his remarks the ad
miral told of two strange incidents In
connection with the battle of July 3
off Santiago. After stating that it had
been the Intention of Admiral Cervera
to make his dash out of the harbor on
the night of July 3. Admiral Schley
said;
"By some of the strange emotions of
telepathy I felt on that night that an
outward movement had been deter
mined upon and decided to connect the
after and forward engines of my ship;
yet I feared to be caught in an opera
tion of nearly an hour, but I was told
that the full speed of four engines and
one-half boiler was greater than two
engines and full boiler power,, so I
risked it. Much has to be risked in
battle. It appeared that at the very
hour I was occupying my mind with
this question Cervera had planned his
attempt to escape.
"An >ther curious Incident followed
their army's retreat to the hills west
of Santiago, when our army was clos
ing rapidly about them. The insur
ants took possession of Spanish block
houses to the number of six and burnÂ»l
them. That was the number of ships
in f'ervera's fleet, and he thought it
was a signal to us of their intended
movement, so he thought to fool the
Yankees and remain until the follow
ing day. That little fact determined
the result."
Admiral Schley, In concluding, re
ferred to His v.ork In Porto Rico as
commissioner and said that the people
were gentle and that with the rule of
Spanish oppression removed and confi
dence established they would be a val
uable addition to the United States.
What their position was, he said, he
would leave to Congress.
PREMIUM ON CRIME.
Light Punishment for an Attempt at
Wholesale Murder.
RAN RAFAEL, Nov. 26.â 1t appears
that some of the officials of this city take
a rather light view of a man's attempt
while under the influence of liquor to kill
his wife and daughter, and afterward to
let daylight stream through the bodies of
the arresting officers.
Last night Joseph Soldavinl fired both
bnrrHs of a shotgun at his wife and his
daughter, causing them to flee for their
lives. Then he barricaded the doors of
his house and threatened to kill anybody
that tried to arrest him. He was dis
armed and lodged in Jail by strategy on
the part of Night Watchmen Peter O'Brien
anu Jacob Miller.
This morning Constable C. M. Sheppard
preferred a charge of simply disturbing
the peace against the desperate man. He
was taken before Justice Gardner and
f riven his liberty upon paying- a fine of
10. m

FRESNO, Nov. 26.â J. M. Dias, an old-
time resident of this county, was found
unconscious on the Selma road this even
ing, near the Colwa winery. He was re
moved to a neaVby saloon, where he died
within an hour. Dias had gone out to
Malaga to see his wife, who was work
ing there, and on the way home he was
thrown from his buggy. He was 62 years
old and leaves a large family.

"OPEN DOOR"
POLICY FOR

PRESIDENT'S VIEWS UPHELD
CONGRESS MAY MAKE TARIFF
CHANGES.
Revenue Systems of the Possessions
Taken From Spain â¢ Continue
to Excite Great Interest
Among Statesmen.
.
i â 
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK Nov. ,26.â Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald
sends the following: Despite the views
of some able constitutional authorities
In and out of Congress the President
and his Cabinet are convinced of the
power of the Government to maintain
an "open door" policy in the Philip
pines.
This whole matter was gone over
very carefully by the administration
before the policy announced in Paris
was adopted, and it was decided that
the right to carry out this system at
least during the term of military occu
pation was ample. I learn that dis
patches from Paris were in error in
saying the commission announced that
the United States would pledge itself
to this policy for a term of years. The
Commissioners went no further than
to declare that this would be the pol
icy of the United States while the Phil
ippines were under military control.
After they pass under the control of
Congress it will be for Congress to de
termine whether the policy shall be
longer continued. It is regarded by the
administration as a good diplomatic
move as It will put the United States
In a strong position in Oriental diplo
macy and will tend to insure the sup
port of Great Britain for any policy
this country may adopt in dealing with
questions arising in that nart of the
world.
Questions of the policy to be adopted
in dealing with the tariff and revenue
systems of the possessions taken from
Spain continue to. excite great interest
among Senators and Representatives
who are arriving in Washington for the
approaching session. As might be ex
pected on the question involving the
construction of a debatable constitu
tional point there is a wide diversity of
views. Senator Gorman does not be
lieve that what is proclaimed as the
"open-door" policy with reference to
the Philippines at all commits this Gov
ernment to a non-uniform tariff sys
tem with reference to these islands. In
due time, he holds, Congress will take
hold of the whole matter and no more
obstruction 'Will exist between the Phil
ippines and the United States than ex
ists between the United States and any
other territory controlled by it. '
Senator Gorman proceeds on the pre
sumption that the Philippines will be
occupied by the United States, and that
the treaty will be signed and ratified
on that basis.
Senator Faulkner of West Virginia, a
member of the Canadian Commission,
says he has carefully examined the so
called open-door proposition, and he
holds there is nothing unconstitutional
in the position paid to have been taken
by the President. He contends that
Congress alone has constitutional power
to levy taxation, and pending action by
Congress the President, in the exercise
of his constitutional power, may es
tablish a military form of government
in the Philippines and make such regu
lations as -will best serve the Interests
of the United States. â â â -,
STOCKHOLDERS WILL GET
|HE FOX JUDGMENT
Judge Hebbard handed down an opinion
yesterday directing that the residue of the
judgment hi the celebrated case of Fox
against the Hale & Norcross Silver Min
ing i 'iimpany be distributed to the stock
holders and not to tho corporation aa a
body. This by no means settles the liti
gation, however, as an appeal will be
taken from the order of distribution. New
points will naturally arise, and in their
order they must be passed upon by the
Supreme Court before the contending liti
gants will be willing to cease battling and
close the suit.
In this action Fox obtained Judgment,
which, with interest, aggregated $304,447 71.
Twice the Supreme Court was called upon
to review the case, and finally on the or
der of that tribunal the money was paid
in Judge Hebbard's department of the Su
perior Court. The amount was placed in
the hands of Recei\ - er Groom and subse
quently deposited in bank, and the order
of yesterday directs the receiver to dis
tribute It to the stockholders, reserving,
however, the payment of the dividend
upon the shares of stock now in contro
versy between the corporation and certain
stockholders concerning a sale thereof,
for nr>n-payment of assessments.
In ordering the distribution of the judg
ment the court says:
The petition presented in this case by the
Grayson Board of directors shows to the court
that the official control of the Hale & Nor
oross Silver Mining Company is now In dis
pute and In litigation which may be prolonged
indefinitely, and In terms asks that the court
lock up this fund for a time Just as Indefi
nite. There is every reason why the court
should proceed and distribute this fund imme
diately. It Is a court of equity; the court has
appointed a receiver to carry the Judgment
hito effect, not to nullify It; the damages to
the stockholders accrued in ISB7, 1888 and 1889;
the then stockholders or their assigns, to
whom all equities attach, are the beneficiaries
of the fund in court; a distribution to tho pw
ent stockholders is. in effect, a distribution to
the corporation; the fund is not and Mas never
been in the possession of the corporation; it is
in legal custody, and so recovered against the
wishes and the efforts of the corporation; the
titlf thereto Is out of the corporation and never
was in the corporation. The cause is in equity,
and the chancellor must see to it that the fund
ha equitably distributed. It Is therefore ordered
that the petition of G. \V. Oraynon and others
claiming to represent the Board of Directors
of the Hale & Norcross Silver Mining Company,
and asking that the fund In court in this case
ba held until the final determination of the
controversy as to which of the contending
Boards of Directors is the de jure board of said
corporation, and then to pay the fund to that
board, be and it Is denied.
It is further ordered that the receiver herein
proceed, after five days, and under the direction
of this court, to distribute said fund to the then
stockholders of said corporation; that is to say:
Out of the judgment collected, to-wtt, the
gum of $304,447 71, there being- already deducted,
under orders of court the sum of $69y4 60. be
ing defendant's costs, and the sum of $76.
111 86, being plaintiff's attorney's fees, 25 per
cent of the judgment, and the sum of $5000,
Tiild to the receiver on account, and the sum of
$5)00 paid to the receiver's attorneys on account,
and the sum of $70 40, being a balance due the
official stenographer of the court In the case.
Bald receiver shall retain the further sum of
$8310 85 for fees and incidental expenses to be
hereafter determined, and upon the balance re
maining of $204,960 said receiver shall declare
a dividend upon 112,000 shares of the stock of
the corporation, being at the rate of $1 83 per
share and shall pay the same to the stock
holders of the corporation, reserving, however,
the payment of said dividend upon the shares
of stock now in controversy between the cor
poration (jnd certain stockholders concerning a
saJe thereof, for non-payment of assessments
thereon, until the further order of the court,
Binl that said receiver report to the court from
time to time what lie has done under this
order.

TELEPHONE WAR
AT SAN JOSE
Price of "Helios" Will
Come Down.
SAN JOSE. Nov. 26.â The Sunset and
the People's telephone companies are at
daggers' points and the Sunset is doing
all in its power to bring about such
a condition of finances in its rival's
exchequer that it can swallow the Peo
ple's. The two lines have never been
friendly, and it looks now as though
the people of San Jose will before lon*
enjoy a telephone war, in which the
price of "hellos" may be cut in two.
More than competition enters into the
fiehf there is local politics, which
dates' back to the charter election of
At that time there were two tickets
in the fieldâ named by the gang
and the other by the citizens and tax
payers. The campaign was a bitter
one Prominent among those opposed
to gang rule and the mismanagement of
city affairs were nearly all the large
stockholders and officers of the People's
Telephone Company. These men were

Then Rea and Mackenzie decided to
teach Dr H J- B- Wm-ht and other
members of the People's Telephone
Company to keep out of politics by
Â«i?plfng their business. Stockholders
frier to the "gang" were given the
tip to get out of the company. Ernest
I- ion and Gus Lion, nephews of Mayor
Martin, who was Rea's candidate in
the charter election, withdrew and sold
their stock. A boycott was then de
clared against the People's Telephone
C A^wtning ally was found in the Sun
set Telephone Company.
Th*> People's Telephone Company was
organized in 1896. Before this time the
business men and residents of San Jose
were at the mercy of the Sunset Com
pany and they were made to pay "all
the traffic would bear." Business
houses paid $5 and. in some instances
$7 a month, and residences $4 a month.
The service was poor, and telephone
employes were autocrats who paid no
attention to the complaints of subscrib
ers. The People's Company was organ
ized by local capital, and in it mer
chants , saw -their salvation. This
forced the Sunset rates to be cut to 52
a month for business houses and $1 25
for residences, and the Sunset's income
was materially reduced. The People's
Company gives a good service, with low
rates, and its list is rapidly growing.
The first move made by the political
leaders against the People's Telephone
Company was to order the 'phones out
of most of the ctlv and county offices.
Five were- taken out of the Courthouse
and five from the City Hall. The Mac
kenzies. who are said to hold franks
over the Sunset line, wore instrumental
in this move. Their friends discon
tinued the 'phones of the -local corpora
tion,- and it Is said that .over 100 instru
ments were removed through the^bov-

pany to inconvenience the people was
made a few days ago. The People's
Company has always had a couple of
Puiiset 'phones in its office and trans
mitted messages free from its sub
scribers to the business houses on Sun
set. For this accommodation it paid
$10 per month. Now the Sunset people
have ordered the local company to dis>
continue this under penalty of having
the 'phones removed from their office.
For a lons time the Southern Pacific
stood in with the Sunset Company and
refused to allow the home people to
put phones in the freight depots, al
though no charge was to be made for
them and they were simply to accom

LONDON, Nov. 26.â France and
Italy, after a decade of tariff warfare, j
have surprised their friends and ene
mies by concluding a commercial ;
treaty which promises to shift the
balance of power in Europe. But for j
the friendship of the United States,
which emboldens Great Britain to
comparative indifference regarding;
continental combinations, Great Brit- i
am would be alarmed at this prospect '
of Italy deserting the triple alliance j
and adding her formidable navy to the
Franco-Russian compact, which is
held to be the inevitable result of the
union of the two estranged nations.
The critics here regard the treaty as a i
sequel to the Fashoda incident, i
France's defeat in Egypt opened her j
eyes to the necessity of increasing the
number of her friends. Therefore, she j
hastened to initiate negotiations with
Italy and will give her weaker neigh
bor the benefit of the minimum tariff,
long and vainly sought by the lat- j
ter. The Italians estimate that under i
the new arrangement a million hecto
litres of heavy southern wines, which
are used in mixing the lighter French
wines, will be exported to France, re- ;
suiting in a great impetus to Italian
Industry. In return France expects to
remove the dangers of having to cope
with the Italian navy in the Mediter
ranean in the event of a German war
and also to nullify Germany's policy
of isolating France.
Free trade Britain has no subsidies
she can offer to retain Italy's support;
but, in the present position of the
wi .lid's politics, she is not as solicitous.
for it as she would have been a year
ago. What Great Britain loses in Italy,
the Westminster Gazette declares, she :
grains in the Philippines.
Conversations which a representative j
of the Associated Press has had with !
politicians here indicate that the inter- i
est of Englishmen in the United States' j
Eastern tariff ia increased \y the be- j
lief that once embarked in colonial ac- J
quisition the United States will be j
compelled, as Great Britain has been, j
to constantly add to her colonies pos
sessions which may be thrown on the (
market merely to prevent them falling ,
into the hands of her rivals. I ]
Th>- inauguration of a "closed door"
policy, they think here, should do much
ial damage to British interests,
and every American utterance tending
reshadow the "open door" policy
has been eagerly seized upon and mag
nified by the editorial writers.
The Speaker says: "The Government
at Washington is creditably anxious to
chow to the world that they do not de
sire mere aggrandizement for their vic
tory over Spain, and they do not desire
to shut out other nations from the ma
terial advantage which they derive
themselves."
The London office of a Philippine cap
italist has received a letter from ite
â  at Manila, dated October 18, in
which the agent says:
"The rebels are prepared already to
n.-sist annexation. I am in the confi
dence of their chiefs and I assure you
they are quite prepared to retire to the
hills if more than a protectorate is of
fered. I hope it will not come to war
like proceedings, for it would be a very
protracted affair. The Americans
would not find the rebels as easy as the
Spaniards did, for they formerly had
only 400 rifles, while the rebels now
have SO, OOO rifles and eighty cannon, in
cluding several Maxims."
The Manila correspondent adds:
"Americans are not allowed to pass
the rebel lines without passportr. A
party of German officers who attempt
ed to do so without passports were
mistaken for Americans and were re
fused permission. When it was dis
covered they were Germans the offi
cers were permitted to proceod."

Philosophy of this kind is based upon
gross ignorance. The fact is, that there is
no necessity for the severe pangs under-
gone by the average woman. If a woman
Is strong and healthy, in a womanly way,
motherhood means to her h;it little suffer-
ing. The trouble lies in tne fact that the
majority of women suffer from weakness
and disease of the distinctly feminine or-
ganism and are unfitted for motherhood.
This can always be remedied. Dr. Pierces
Favorite Prescription is a sure, speedy and
permanent cure for all disorders of this
description. It acts directly on the delicate
and important organs concerned, making
them healthy, strong, vigorous, virile and
elastic. It banishes the indispositions of
the period of expectancy and makes baby's
advent easy and almost painless. It quick-
ens and vitalizes the feminine organs, and
insures a healthy and robust baby. Thou-

velous merits. Honest druggists do.net

SHIPBUILDERS' TRUST
HAS BEEN ORGANIZED
But the United States Will Defeat the Object of
*the Combination by Building Warships
at Its Own Yards if Necessary.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 26.â Notwithstanding Henry T. Scott's state
ment that no trust of ship-builders is contemplated, there are reasons
for believing otherwise, although In justice to Mr. Scott it is only fair
to assume that he had no knowledge of such an organization when he
made his denial last Wednesday. The Navy Department has been
informed that ship-builders may organize, but the department is pre
pared to resist any possible extortionate exactions hereafter by
building its own vessels at its navy-yards, if this shall become ne
cessary. A naval bureau chief said to The Call correspondent to-day
that he believed the ship-builders would abandon their idea of a
trust when they were made to realize that the Government was
ready to recommend to Congress that its shipbuilding. plants at va
rious navy-yards, including Mare Island, be so increased and Im
proved as to be capable of turning out as good vessels as are
now constructed by private contractors.
"If we ascertain that such a trust actually exists we will undoubt
edly have the support of Congress and the necessary appropriations
to enlarge our facilities at the navy-yards," he said.

says the Americans have magnified the

There is a report in commercial cir
cles that Spain will reorganize her en
tire financial system and readjust her
bonded indebtedness after the treaty
of peace is signed. This report disturbs
the bondholders of Spain. '
An English Carlist positively asserts
that Don Carlos' army will take the
field in Spain soon after the treaty is
signed. He declares that a loan has
been fully financed and that it is di
vided equally between France and Eng
land, and he adds that after the Eng
lish capitalists were shown the evi
dences on which Don Carlos' chances
of success are based, they offered sev
eral times the amount asked. The
Englist Carlists assert that much more
money would have been secured had it
not been for the fact that Don Carlos
stipulated that there should be no as
sistance from Jews, as he Is apprehen
sive of their obtaining financial con
trol of the monarchy.
Continuing, it was asserted that the
Spanish Government has known for
some time that Don Carlos possessed
an army, organized into battalions and
batteries, officered and largely armed,
but the Spanish Ministers counted on
his failuaÂ§ to secure funds. Therefore
the Spanfth Government is said to be
panic stricken and to be endeavoring
to make the Spaniards believe that
Great Britain has agreed to finance
Don Carlos and that hie, in return, has
undertaken to cede the Canary Islands
to Great Britain in the event of suc
cess.
The commission appointed by the
Spanish Chambers of Commerce to
consider the question of reforms in
Spain met at Saragossa and recom
mended sweeping military and civil re
trenchment, in addition to many re
forms for the benefit of the working
men. The commission also pronounced
in favor of an investigation into the
continuance of the Cuban insurrection
and withholding the rewards promised
to Cuban officers.
The recent tragic death of the Em
press of Austria overclouds the celebra
tion in that country of the half-century
of the Emperor's reign and prevents
the carrying out of the festive featmes
of the programme. The ceremonies
will be confined to the churches, schools
and army, and Vienna will be decorated
and illuminated only by private citi
zens.
The Austrian Reichsrath assembled
yesterday and listened to the addresses
of the presidents of the two houses
eulogizing the reign of Emperor Francis
Joseph. The members as a rule wore
evening dress and decorations, but the
Poles and Czechs were dressed in gala
national costumes. Only the benches of
the Socialists were empty, the members
of that party having refused to partici
pate in the meeting. About 4000 civic
honors will be conferred on December
2, the anniversary of the proclamation,
In 1848, of Francis Joseph as Emperor
of Austria, after the abdication of his
uncle, Ferdinand T. and the renuncia
tion of the crown by his father. Among
those who will be honored are all the
burgomasters. All the garrisons will
attend church, and every soldier, in
cluding the retired and bronze medal
men of each regiment, will select the
best officer or private for a decoration.
GRANTED WATER FRONT
FOR ITS TERMINAL
Monterey and Fresno Railroad Com
pany Receives a Provisional
Gift.
SALINAS. Nov. 26.â During the visit
j here of Mayor Johnson of Monterey this
j afternoon he officially gave out the infor
! mation that the Council of that city had
i grantpfl to the Monterey and Fresno Rail-
I road Company 1470 feet of water front, all
i that was owned by the city, on the pro
vis. 1 that active operations on the road
be commenced within forty days.
The constra<t with the California Con
struction Company calls for work to begin
thirty days after the contract was signed,
which was on November 15. It specifies
that the company must construct, equip
and put Into operation a first-class road
bftween Monterey and Hollister, with all
rolling stock, depots and other appurte
nances. The work must be finished and
j the road in operation by July 15, 1&99. A
I bond of $100,000 has been given the trustees
of Monterey County to bind the contract.
Colonel A. W. Jonea. president of the rail
road, says that as soon as eight or ten
remaining rights of way are obtafned the
work will begin. This will be before De
cember 10.
PRESIDENT M'MANES
FULFILLS HIS PLEDGE
Pays Off Every Dollar Due Creditors
of the People's Bank of
Philadelphia.
PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 26.â Thomas TV.
Barlow, receiver of the People's Bank, has
notified the depositors of that institution
that the remaining 10 per cent due them
will be paid on and after December 5,
1898. This payment will close every un
contested claim against the bank, includ
ing those for tho deposits of the city and
State.
The People's Bank closed its doors on
March 25. after the cashier John S. Hop
kins, had committed suicide. Tho liabili
ties were about $1,500,000, while the assets
were less than $1,000,000.
, At the time of the suspension President
McManes pledged himself to pay the de
positors dollar for dollar, and the an
nouncement of Receiver Barlow shows
that he has kept his word.

Digging- for Gold Near
San Rafael.
RESERVOIR HILL CROWDED
MEN EVEN CROSS THE BAY TO
SEARCH.
Excited by the Story of Leopold

Buried by Bandit Adolph

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, Nov. 26.â 1t is evi
dent that there are several hundred
persons residing in this city and its
environs to whom the Klondike is a
matter of secondary consideration at
! present. As soon as the news reached
â  the public generally through the me
. .liurn of The Call that Leopold Goetz,
j a local cigar manufacturer, was search
; ing for over $50,000 in gold dust and
; nuggets believed to have been cached
] by Adolph Newton, a Shasta 1 County
bandit, in the year 1866, and had ex
: pressed confidence that he would lay
I hands on the booty, there was an exo
j dus of people with Reservoir Hill as
i the Mecca of their hopes.
Goetz this morning repaired to his
mountain haunts with the intention of
pursuing his excavations. What he
saw caused him to come back with eyea
dilated with wonder.
"Holy smokes!" he exclaimed to a
confidential friend, who thought the
story too good to keep, "dot hill vas
simply loaded down, mit people. Dere
ain't a man but has some sort of tools
to dig somewheres mit, and dey is
dryin' to move de whole hills avay from
dere."
Goetz was shown The Call article,
j and his astonishment increased. He im
] mediately asserted that he must take
! some means to throw the public off
the track. He found a reporter later
and told him that he had already found
the money and taken it to San Fran
j Cisco, and requested him to publish the
I statement.
The explanation he offers now for be
ing in possession of the diagram of the
location where the go-Id is cached is
that he got it from a cousin of Newton,
who, he says, lives in San Francisco.
This explanation is rather flimsy, for It
would appear that the cousin would
certainly be eager to get the go-Id him
self.
The search for the treasure is not
confined to San Rafael and vicinity.
Several came across the bay to-day and
Joined the ranks of those -mw after the
gold, while one man put in three hours'
time trying to find Goetz himself. This
man claimed that he had an instrument
that would locate gc-ld buried at a
depth of five feet If it were brought
within fifty feet of where it is hidden.

at 1:30 o'clock this morning formally
re-signed the office of Governor General
and Captain General of the Island of
Cuba, In favor of General Jlminez Cas

the palace without any further sol
emnity than the secretary of the Gov

the subject In the nresence of the Colo
nial Governor, and General Parrado,
General Solano, General Ruiz and Gen
eral Tejada. The ceremony and fes
tivities attending the taking of the

the appointment of a new Governor
General were dispensed with on the
present occasion. There was merely a
formal turning over 'of the military
c ..imands.
Preparations for the rapid evacuation
of the provinces of Pinar del Rio and
Havana are progressing actively. The
Spanish transnort Covadonga arrived
here last night.
The United States transport Florida

KRIE, Pa., Nov. 26.â When ex -Mayor
Magowan of Trenton, charged with kid
naping, heard that Governor Hastings
had granted a requisition returning him
to Ohio, Magowan tried to hire a tug to
take him to Canada, but could find no
owners who would rent a vessel to him.
He next offered to buy a tug, but was
unable to secure one. When it was
learned that Magowan was trying to leave
the country he was arrested and taken
before Judge Walling, who sent him to

BERLIN,' Nov. 26.â The German
press this week has busied itself a great
deal about the Philippine question and
the peace negotiations at Paris. Nearly
all the comment has been uncompli
mentary to the United States, which is
charged with "excessive greed and po
litical indecency in formulating new
demands, " President McKinley being
accused of "inconsistency" and "lack of
backbone" in not withstanding "the in
creasing demands of the imperial
party."
A number of the German papers
have now adopted a strain indicating
a desire to obtain a portion of the
Spanish Asiatic possessions for Ger
many. The Kreuz Zeitung, which has
much influence at court and in army
circles, says:
"Germany is materially interested in
the outcome of the peace negotiations,
more particularly with respect to the
Sulu archipelago, where Germany and
Great Britain possess the same kind of
commercial privileges, granted to them
by Spain in 1877, and in which Ham
burg and Bremen are largely inter
ested.
"American annexation of this group,
besides being a matter of strategic im
portance, would mean, in view of
America's prohibitory tariff policy, the
I destruction of both the German and
j British trade. In short, an understand
: ing with Great Britain for joint action
I and intervention is absolutely indis-
p ensable. The theory of an 'American
i sea' cannot be accepted by any of the
i European nations. Air. Kasson, there
fore, has been indulging in day
dreams."
The Deutsche Zeitung, an organ of
the Pan-German party, says: "It ,is
particularly painful that with the Caro
line Islands, to which will probably be
added the rest of the islands, a piece of
Spanish goods is disposed of to which
we had the historical pre-emption
claim."
The Deutsche Zeitung concludes with
urging the Government to seize the oc
casion to acquire a portion of the Caro
lines, or at least secure compensation
in Samoa, and also obtain guarantees
for the future of Germany's commer
cial interests in the Philippines and
Sulu archipelagos.
"Guarantees," it says spitefully,
"which will hold water even against
American Interpretations."
In spite of the newspaper comments,
the correspondent of the Associated
Press Is informed on good authority
that Germany still does not contem
plate Interference, active or otherwise,
with the American claims, at least as
lonf as no concerted action is proposed
or carried out Jointly by the European
powers. This statement tallies with
assurances given by the Foreign Office
here. So far as the United States Em
bassy is concernod, no proposition Of
any kind has been made by the Ger
man Government. In fact, the Ger
man press utterances urpin~ Germany
to secure special benefits from America
or Spain during the peace negotiations
are solely an expression of the wishes
of part of the German people, and they
in no wav bind the Government, which
is now, more than ever, desirous of fos
tering the good will of America.
The Cologne Gazette publishes a let
ter from a correspondent at Manila as
serting with "keen regret" that half
of the United States land and naval
force there is composed of Germans,
and giving a far from flattering picture
of American rule at Manila.
The Manila correspondent of the Vos
sische Zeitung draws an even more
gloomy picture, dwelling upon the al
leged prevalence of drunkenness and
other excesses among the American
troops.
Emperor William has returned home
to find Germany in a seething political
ferment. All classes of society seem
permeated with the spirit of unrest and
dissatisfaction. In liberal and radical
circles there is a feeling that there is
too much of the personal element in the
government of the country and that
this personal rule is doing much mis
chief. This feeling has found expres
sion in a strong article in the Vor
waerts, which discusses the matter in
its usual caustic and able way. It
says:
"There is an imperial Chancellor and
there are imperial Prussian ministers.
But who hears of them? Where is
Prince Hohenlohe? What is he doing?
No one knows. We hear day after day
of the acts of the Government. The
Emperor is everywhere and the Chan
cellor is nowhere."
The meeting of the Reichstag is
looked forward to with apprehension.
The reopening of that body was an
nounced to-day for December 6, and
domestic problems will have to be
faced which it will require most tactful
and liberal statesmanship to solve sat
isfactorily. The anti-Semites are clam
oring for measures against the Jews;
the Junkers demand legislation to ar
rest the growth of the Polish population
and to oppose the steady march of the
Slav races westward; the Socialists are
clamorous for recognition and extension
of the rights of the working class; the
Radicals are insisting on a whole pro
gramme of reforms; the Danes in North
Schleswig are bitterly resenting the ex
pulsions of Danes; the Alsatians are
opposing a dictatorship in Alsace-Lor
raine, and the Agrarians are goading
the \Government into a reactionary
tariff policy.
Such is the stormy sea of conflicting
demands in which the German Govern
ment has to navigate during the com
ing session of the Imperial Diet.
It was hoped the Emperor would visit
the three South German rulers on his
way home and assist in the task of
government by allaying some of the 111 -
feelin? which is still latent in the south
against Prussia.
The fact that Russia is not on very
friendly terms with Germany and that
Emperor William's visit to the Holy
Land has made matters worse is re
ceiving confirmation in more than one
quarter. Prince Ukholmsky, the Czar's
close friend and confidant, in the St.
Petersburg A r edomosti, violently ex
presses Russian disapproval of the
trip, calling Emperor William a rene
gade and accusing the whole German
nation of being his accomplices. More
over, the fact that the Czar, contrary

to common explanation, has not given
a sign himself during the German Em
peror's trip is held here to be clear
evidence of strained relations existing
between the two courts.
The Emperor and Empress of Ger
many returned home terribly sunburn
ed, but they have been benefited in
health.
During their majesties' trip the or
chestra of the imperial yacht Hohen
zollern performed on several occasions
a symphony composed by the Emperor,
and while at Messina, Sicily, the sym
phony was performed at the opera
house.
The audience did not appreciate its
beauties and gave unmistakable signs
of displeasure.
Emperor William presented Queen
Margaret of Italy with a birthday gift
of four costly oriental rugs from the
Sultan's factory. Incidentally the Sul
tan's presents to the Emperor and Em
press of Germany, which have arrived
here, fill a big freight car, without
counting two beautiful caiques which
the Sultan gave the Emperor on learn
ing of the latter's love for rowing.
Emperor William has sent the Sul
tan a bronze table, in the center of
which is a portrait of the Kaiser fn the
uniform of the Guard dv Corps, and he
has also sent the Sultan two oil paint
ings, painted by himself in Damascus,
representing types of Turkish soldiers.
A sensation is related by a German
named Fisher, who has returned home
after five years served in the French
legion at Salda, province of Osan, Al
geria, and elsewh r.fl in Algeria. Fisher,
it appears, desertt \ three months ago,
succeeded in reaching Morocco and
from there traveled to Hamburg.
He has now informed the military
authorities that a German had been
kept in severe imprisonment in a tower
at Saida ever since the Franco-German
war. According to the Vossische Zei
tung. the German Foreign Office has
taken steps to secure the release of
this soldier, who, apparently in defiance
of all international law, has been a
prisoner for nearly thirty years.
Official statistics show that German
cattle everywhere are suffering from

Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 26.â The United
Statea navy has landed marines In
China. A dispatch was received at the i
Navy Department to-day statins that I
the captain of the Boston had land- ]
ed his marine guard at Tientsin. The
dispatch was taken immediately to the
White House by Acting Secretary Al- 4
len.
Secretary Hay was called in consul
tation, with the result of reassuring- the
officials and allaying their rirst feeling !
of apprehension. It seems that the ma- |
rines were landed not because of any !
information of rioting or attacks upon <
American missionaries but solely to i
act as guard for the United States Le- j
gation at Peking.
The Boston was dispatched to the j
mouth of the Pieho River several weeks
apo at the instance of United States
Minister Conger to provide a guard
for the legation. The Minister repre
sented that nearly all of the legations
of the European powers were provided
with marine guards and he did not care
to be exceptional in this case. After ly
in- at Tangu for a while, the Boston S
worked her way up the river to Tien- I
tsin, about the head of navigation for j
vessels of her class and distant about
fifty or sixty miles from Peking. It is
believed at the Navy Department
that the marines will be sent forward
from that point in launches or small
river boats. Captain Frank Wilder,
the commander of the Boston, who re
ported the landing to the Navy Depart
ment by cabl-, did not state how many
I i â¢
men were In the guard, but the force
is not believed to exceed two dozen.
The presence of these foreign guards
is not welcome to the Chinese Govern
ment. When the landing was nrst pro
posed its representative sought to dis
suade the United States Government
from inflicting this humiliation upon
It. The effect was to cause a suspen
sion of the execution of the purpose,
but, as has already been stated, most
of the European legations have pro-
Tided themselves with guards, and th*
Chinese, having become reconciled . to
their presence, no longer object in our
case.
Advices that reach the State Depart
ment do not indicate an immediate out
break in China. But the reactionary
policy of the Empress Dowager has
caused a very uneasy feeling, and may
afford one or more of the European
powers, who have been active in East
ern affairs, a pretext for making a
coup, with results affecting the inter-
ests of the United States.
AGUINALDO REFUSES
TO FREE CLERICALS
Insurgent Leader Addresses a Second
Communication to General
Otis.
MANILA. Nov. 26.â Aguinaldo, the
insurgent leader, has addressed a sec
ond communication to Major General
Otis, the American military com
mander, on the subject of the Spanish
prisoners in the hands of the insur
gents. He has declined to release the
clericals and civilians, arguing that
both carried arms voluntarily against
the insurgents. Aguinaldo then refers
General Otis to the local papers pub
lished since the insurrection for "irre
futable proof" of his assertion that the
clericals were the most active and
vengeful agents in "sacrificing the lives
and honor of innocent natives."
Continuing, Aguinaldo quotes the in
ternational rule of reprisal, claiming
the right to delay the prisoners in the
hope of causing Spain -'to liberate the
Filipinos and to cease torturing and
shooting natives whose only crime has
been the love of liberty."
Ab to his having said, in a former let
ter, that international laws must recede
before the just wishes of the people,
Aguinaldo asserts that he meant that,
under the existing circumstances, rec
ognized laws "must accede to the wishes
of those fighting for the recognition of
the bulk of said laws."
The insurgent leader also maintains
his right to detain the prisoners until
the Vatican recognizes the rights of the
Filipino clericals and civilians or until
they are exchanged.
The United States transports Arizona
and Ohio have arrived here with rein
forcements.

J. E. FARNUM'S SHAMELESS PLOT TO
PLUNDER THE PEOPLE'S BANK
Tragic Story of a Day in
tr;e Affairs of the
Banks.
Th)c McDooalds Ordered to Give
Up Ooe Hundred Thousar)d
Dollars in Coin.
In its expose of the shameless rob
beries that were committed in the name
of the People's Home Savings Bank
and the Pacific Bank The Call has
mentioned incidentally the name of
John E. Farnum. This man is the
present manager of the now defunct
Pacific Bank, and The Call proposes to
tell what part he took in the ruin of
the institutions in which thousands of
men and women and children had
placed their savings.
Mr. Farnum's connection with the
People's Home Savings Bank dates, as
already indicated in The Call, from a
very early period in the conspiracy. He
was placed in the People's Home Sav
ings Bank by his relative, ML H. Sher
man. He used the funds of the savings
institution to assist his relative, Sher
man, in every scheme that demanded
assistance. He was something more
than Dr. McDonald believed. He was
not only a servant of the McDonalds,
but for several years he was the dicta
tor of their affairs. He stooped to
every dishonorable duty they demand
ed, and then having the dishonest
bankers in his power he commanded
them to do what he pleased. He sent
them money from the People's Home
Savings Bank in a golden stream to
the Pacific Bank in order that his rela
tive, Moses H. Sherman, might receive
it; and when this stream seemed likely
to be stopped even by the McDonalds
he commanded the bankers by delib
erate and absolute threats to give what
money they had left for the worthless
securities of Sherman.
After John E. Farnum was placed in
the People's Home Savings Bank as
manager he became the "stool pigeon"
and outside guard of the conspiracy.
It was his duty to warn the bank
wreckers whenever the Bank Commis
sioners threatened to descend upon
them. It was his privilege to tell them
what the authorities were likely to do.
An soon as the money of thousands of
poor depositors was placed in the
vaults of the People's Home Savings
Bank it was the duty of Farnum to
send it to the Pacific Bank. After both
institutions became insolvent this man
continued in control, and even when
the McDonalds wished to call a halt he
commanded them to continue their
depredations and to permit Moses H.
Sherman to foist his worthless securi
ties upon the savings institution.
This terrible affair in which Farnum
played the leading part did not end
until long after the collapse of the Pa
cific Bank and the People's Home Sav
ings Bank. When Sherman found it
impossible to keep his relative in the
People's Bank he thrust Farnum upon
the Pacific Bank, and there he remains
as the director and manager of what
remains to the deluded and robbed
creditors of the institution.
The events that are incidental to the
placing of John E. Farnum in the Peo
ple's Home Savings Bank and after
that in the Pacific Bank are of timely
Interest. Farnum was a member of the
Legislature when the Bank Commis
sioner act of this State was adopted.
As a member of the Legislature Far
num possessed some influence, and
with that influence he succeeded in
having himself made a member of the
Bank Commission. In that capacity
he became acquainted with the affairs
and private doings of the banks of this
State. He became connected with a
bank in Pasadena and familiarized
himself with banking methods. This
was long before Sherman planned his
tremendous raid on the People's Home
Savings Bank and the Pacific Bank.
B. O. Carr, a brother-in-law of Moses
H. Sherman, was the first manager of
the People's Home Savings Bank. Mr.
Carr was an honest man and necessar
ily was useless to Sherman. After
Sherman became a director in the Pa
cific Bank in January, 1891, he succeed
ed in securing for his relative, Farnum,
the position of manager of the People's
Home Savings Bank.
The McDonalds had at that time
plunged into hazardous speculation.
The funds of the Pacific Bank and the
People's Home Savings Bank were be
ing dissipated in crazy schemes and
unwarranted ventures. Sherman had
already involved the McDonalds and
their banks in his Phoenix schemes
and he was prepared to inveigle them
into the great Los Angeles electric road
deal. Farnum was necessary, therefore,
to the success of Sherman's plot and
the man who is now manager of the
Pacific Bank was placed in full con
trol as manager of the People's Home
Savings Bank. He had absolute power
in that position until the final collapse.
When the end came he resigned his
position, under instructions, and re
tired from the bank. Almost instantly,
through the agency of Moses H. Sher
man, Farnum was replaced.
The Call has already exploited the
scheme of the Los Angeles manipula
tor to control the liquidation of the
People's Home Savings Bank. Sher
man had determined to protect his dis
reputable interests in the bank and
Farnum was selected as his agent.
"When Farnum was appointed as re
ceiver, however, those who were inter
ested in the honest closing of the bank
rebelled and Farnum had the unenvia
ble honor of being the receiver of the
bank for two hours. He never obtained
actual possession and was thrown out
to be succeeded by others.
Notwithstanding this tremendous de
feat Sherman was persistent. He still
had the Bank Commission in his power
and with the assistance of Attorney
General Hart and others he placed Far
num in the Pacific Bank as receiver.
A series of legal complications followed
and Farnum and Sherman won out, and
to-day Mr. Farnum is the manager of
the Pacific Bank.
As already indicated in The Call the
association of Mr. Farnum with the
McDonalds began through Moses H.
Sherman. It was through the agency
of Sherman that Farnum was placed in
the bank as a servant and a willing
tool of the McDonalds. Before the as
sociations were closed Farnum became
one of the most uncompromising con
spirators, who forced from the McDon
alds the remaining funds of the banks.
Late in 1892 and early in 1893 the Pa
cific Bank was sorely in need of funds
and was depending solely upon the
People's Home Savings Bank for its
resources. Sherman's schemes had al
ready made the banks insolvent, but
the deluded people of this city were still
pouring their money into the People's
Home Savings Bank. This Institution
was nothing more or less than a sieve
through which the savings of deposi
tors dropped into the vaults of the Pa
cific Bank to be dissipated in their wild
speculations. Farnum knew the situa
i tion thoroughly and knew what was
i expected of him. He knew that as soon
as money came into the People's Home
Savings Bank it was to be sent to the
Pacific Bank and he carried out bis
contract to the letter.
One of his first important letters in
reference to this proposition was writ
ten early in 1893 and is as follows:
SAN FRANCISCO, January 7, 1893.
Mr. R. H. McDonald Jr., vice-presi
dent Pacific Bank, San Francisco,
Cal.â Dear Sir: I send per our mes
senger thiÃ morning twenty thousand
($20,000) dollars in coin.
We have on hand a little more than
we think we will need in payment of
recent dividends. Besides, loans are
not being applied for to any great ex
tent, and we cannot afford to keep
the cash on hand without getting any
interest thereon.
A year ago our board of directors
decided to have the rate of interest
changed which your bank allowed us
from six per cent to four and a half
per cent, with the expectation that the
money would be available for loans
and investments within six months
thereafter.
While we have gradually drawn
down our balance, still it is of such a
sum as not to be of moment to us; and
if your bank can now allow us from the
first of January five per cent on our
daily balances I know it would be
greatly appreciated by our directors.
Please let me know if that meets
with your favor, and I will be glad to
bring thÂ« matter up before our board
at their next meeting. Tours truly,
J. E. FARXUM, Secretary.
The foregoing letter, which was writ
ten by Farnum in January, 1893, was. in
a measure somewhat formal. A month
and a week afterward Mr. Farnum
wrote another letter In which he
showed clearly how the People's Home
Savings Bank was being bled to sus
tain the dying energies of the Pacific
Bank. The Call promised to prove that
the People's Home Savings Bank was
simply a feeder for the Pacific Bank,
and in the following letter of John E.
Farnum that promise is kept:
SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 15, 1593.
R. H. McDonald Jr., Pacific Bank-
Dear Sir: Yours at hand, and in reply
permit me to say that the R. Coal
Company paid only a portion of their
loan yesterday, but I expect to col
lect In all of it this week if possible.
I send you $10,000 coin this a. m., and
will continue to send our surplus
money for our credit with you. Your
apprehension as per your letter may
be well founded, but I do not look for
anything of that nature, although it
is well enough to be prepared.
I do not know what your Ideas are,
but I presume there Is to be a limit
to the amount that you expect to re
ceive from us and a time beyond which
the special deposits are expected to
cease. Please let me know about that
and oblige, yours truly.
J. E. FARNUM.
Two months later affairs in the Peo
ple's Home Savings Bank and the Pa
cific Bank were becoming critical. The
enormous debt of the Pacific Bank was
rapidly approaching $1,000,000, and,
notwithstanding the compliance of the
Bank Commissioners, It was imperative
something should be done. Farnum
and Frank McDonald understood thor
oughly that it was impossible to con
tinue the depredations upon the People's
Bank any longer, and a series of tele
grams passed between the conspirators.
These telegrams show how clearly the
bank wreckers understood that they
would have to settle their accounts in
,the People's Bank. This, however, was
impossible, and affairs had drifted to
such a stage that Farnum himself took
the reins and forced upon the dishonest
bankers the concluding outrages of
Sherman. He not only insisted that
Sherman should be tolerated in his dis
honest manipulations, but he planned
to foist upon the banks several more of
Sherman's worthless loans. The chief
of these loans was in reference to the
Electric ItaJlroad of Phoenix, Ariz.
This road, as The Call has already
shown, was built at an expense not ex
ceeding $35,000. With this investment
Sherman floated a bond issue of $66,
000. These bonds the Los Angeles and
Phoenix manipulator foisted upon the
Pacific Bank and the People's Home
Savings Bank. These two Institutions
as far as money was concerned were
one. Sherman had Frank McDonald
absolutely under his control, and he
had had his relative, John E. Farnum,
in the People's Bank. The McDonalds
had already given $66,000 for the bonds
of the Phoenix Railroad, which was
I subsequently known as the Valley
j Street Electric Railroad. Sherman's
agents, who happened to be dishonest
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL., SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 27, 1898.
employes of McDonald, appraised the
road far above its actual value, but
the McDonalds had accepted the bonds
and they were forced to abide by their
acceptance. With a greed which seems
almost inconceivable, Moses H. Sher
man determined to bleed the McDon
alds on this very proposition for JIOO,
000 more. He was not satisfied in hav
ing floated a grossly excessive issue
of bonds, but decided to add $100,000
more to the issue.
At that time the Pacific Bank and the
People's Home Savings Bank were in
dire distress. Both institutions were
nearing collapse. The Riverside bank
ers were increasing their, tremendous
overdrafts and the McDonilds were ap
pealing hopelessly for money- The men
whom they had placed in the banks as
servants had become dictators. Those
who had been suppliants were now at
the throats of the dishonest financiers.
Sherman and his relative, John E. Far-
num, saw their tremendous advantage
and they forced the McDonalds to ac
cept on pain of disaster the new issue
of $100,000 of worthless bonds. The
correspondence in reference to this
transaction is of exceptional Interest.
PEOPLE'S BANK A "FENCE" FOR THE PACIFIC.
When John E. Farnum was manager of the People's Home Savings Bank it was his policy to send by messenger the
money that he received from depositors down to thÂ© Pacific Bank, where the funds were dissipated in the wild
schemes of M. H. Sherman and the other conspirators. Time after time demands were made on Farnum for more money.
He replied that he gave the money received from his depositors to the Pacific Bank as quickly as It came in and he
could not be expected to do any more. His letter acknowledging this fact is given above in fac-slmile.
The McDonalds understood thoroughly
their desperate condition. They knew
that at any moment the Bank Commis
sioners might descend upon them and
close the banks. Dick McDonald was
In this city bearing the full force of the
attack. His father and brother were
In New York dome their utmost to
realize something upon worthless se
curities. Farnum and Sherman were
in San Francisco bleeding the last drop
from the banks. Diclc McDonald did
not dare protest. Every s-ct that he
dared perform was dictated by Sher
man and Farnum. The telegrams that
he sent to New York to his brother
were forced from him by these two con
spirators. They would not even let
him out of their sight and went with
him to the telegraph office In order that
they might assure themselves that he
did what they commanded him to do.
They were forcing from him $100,000 In
gold for the utterly worthless bonds of
the Phoenix electric railroad.
In all the secret history of the Paci
fic Bank there Is no more dramatic
spectacle than this.
Dick McDonald, by his own confes
sion, was dishonest. He and his broth
er had placed themselves in the power
of unscrupulous men and In the last
incidents of this financial tragedy Dick
McDonald was forced to sit at his desk
with John E. Farnum and Moses H.
Bherman dictating the telegrams that
were designed to take from the Peo
ple's Home Savings Bank the savings
of poor depositors. Dick McDonald did
not dare rebel.
The correspondence which is In the
possession of The Call shows that he
obeyed the commands of Farnum and
Sherman and sent the telegrams as
they were dictated. He was caged like
a rat in the office of his bank, and with
these men leaning above him he penned
his dispatches. The conspirators then
permitted him to go, and then Dick Mc-
Donald sought the next nearest tele
graph station \{> send another telegram,
countermanding what he had already
sent,' and telling his brother that his
first message had been dictated by the
two conspirators, Moses H. Sherman
and John E. Farnum.
The epistolary and telegraphic corre
spondence which proves these asser
tions Is of exceptional interest. This
tremendous struggle between the caged
banker and the conspirators who held
him by the throat began in May, 1893.
One of the first telegrams sent indi
cates McDonald's position and his tre
mendous effort to defeat the designs of
Farnum and Sherman. The dispatch
wad sent by Dick McDonald to his
brother, Frank. The first part of the
message has reference to the John
Brown Colony, and is not of primary
importance. The concluding part shows
how Dick McDonald attempted to de
feat the men who had literally become
highwaymen. They were simply stand
ing the McDonalds up as any robber
would on the road. The message is as
follows:
SAN FRANCISCO, Cal., May 11.
Mr. Frank V. McDonald, care Mr.
F. S. Edminster, 44 Broad street, room
6, N. V. : John wires "Bonds sold

loan." Wire him as secretary.
RICHARD.
The correspondence in reference to
the tremendous theft planned by Sher
man and Farnum In reference to the
Phoenix Electric Railroad came thick
and fast At the dictation of these two
conspirators Dick McDonald wrote a
telegram that was forced from him
as it might have been at the point of a
pistol. This telegram was as follows:
Bank Commissioners have seen Far
num nnd say that we owe People's,
including stock, over seven hundred
thousand Rnd cannot allow us draw
out more until we make account good.
They Investigated Phoenix railway,
approving provided Sherman guaran
teed, also leave land additional se
curity. They pronounce Sherman
financially strong. His guarantee ac
ceptable. Will also allow People's take
Electric bonds. Also other assets of
OUTS sufficient pay everything. Per
mitting us draw one hundred fifty be
fore 21st. Sherman guarantees issue
not to exceed one sixty-five bonds
covering City lighting plant. Guaran
tees principal and interest. Telegraph
consent.
This telegram R. H. McDonald was
forced to send. He sent It under the
conditions The Call has already indi
cated. The conspirators and bank
wreckers, one of whom is now manager
of the defunct Pacific Bank, stood at
his very shoulder. Frank McDonald
did not understand at that moment the
dreadful situation of h!s brother. He
sent, therefore, the following sensa
tional telegram:
NEW YORK, May 12, 1893.
R. H. McDonald Jr., Pacific Bank,
San Francisco, Cal. : Sherman propo
sition monstrous fraud and imposition.
Property, including proposed realty,
not worth half the amount asked. His
personal guarantee of little value-
Bonds in no case worth over ninety
cents. I better take to-morrow night's
train back for California; then we can
together defeat this Imposition. /
FRANK.
Later in the day, within thirty min
utes after the foregoing telegram was
sent from New York, Frank McDonald
made an appeal in a telegram to John
E. Farnum. Frank McDonald was
confessedly a thief, but he could not
complacently see one hundred thousand
dollars more go out of the bank to
Moses H. Sherman. Frank's telegram
to Farnum was as follows:
NEW YORK, May 12, 1893.
J. E. Farnum, Manager People's
Home Savings Bank, San Francisco:
Sherman far overestimates his rail
way and realty. We cannot accept
and guarantee another hundred such
bonds. His failure to submit proposi
tion to me shows bad faith. We pre
fer to offer you other security. I ex
pect to leave hers to-morrow night
for San Francisco. Please show this
to Mr. Waterhouse and my brother.
f. v. McDonald.
The reference in this telegram to Co
lumbus Waterhouse is significant. The
cc-nspirators were so insistent that they
left no stone unturned to force the Mc-
Donalds to give up this coveted $100,
000. Columbus Waterhouse, who was
then president of the People's Home
Savings Bank, was pressed into the
service, and on the very same day tele
graphed, urging Frank McDonald to
accept the proposition of Sherman and
Farnum and at the same time inserting
the covert threat that the Bank Com
missioners were supporting the con
spirators. Waterhouse's telegram was
as follows:
SAN FRANCISCO, May 12, 1893.
F. V. McDonald, care of Edminster
& Co., 44 Broad street. New York: This
first time commissioners have made
positive proposition. "We better ac
cept it. Cannot deposit with Pacific
specially unless you wire approval to
Farnum. C. WATERHOUSE.
Even this telegram was not enough
for the conspirators in their efforts to
secure for Moses H. Sherman $100,000
mo out of the People's Home Say-
ings Bank. Dick McDonald had been
compelled to send his telegrams at the
dictation of Sherman and Farnum.
Waterhouse had sent an imperative
message and then Farnum himself on
the very same day wired a dispatch as
follows:
BAN FRANCISCO, Cal.. May 12th.
F. V. McDonald, 44 Broad street:
You must give consent to take Phoe
nix Railway bonds. It is absolutely
necessary and with guarantees jt
meets with approval of B. (Jomsrs.
and our board. Answer.
J. S. FARNUM.
Dick McDonald, as already indicated,
was like a caged animal in the office
of his bank. He sent to his brother
the telegram urging him to accept the
monstrous proposition that had been
made by Sherman and his relative Far
num. Having sent this telegram and
hav'ng escaped from the espionage of
the two conspirators McDonald went
to his home at 813 Sutter strest. At
the corner of Sutter and Leavenworth
streets he sent a telegram showing
clearly under what stress he had sent
his first message. In his second dis
patch he spoke very plainly to his
brother. He declared that his message
and all the others that had been sent
on that day, May 12, were dictate! by
M. H. Sherman and John E. Farnum.
In the telegram that will follow S. re
fers to Sherman and F. to Farnum.
Dick McDonald's telegram is as fol
lows:
SAN FRANCISCO, May 12, 1893.
Mr. Frank V. McDonald, care of Mr.
F. S. PJdminster, 44 Broad street, room
8, New York: Telegram sent dictated
by S.. and F. Wire simply consent.
Nothing else. Otherwise got no money.
Advise temporarily submit. Late can
upset loan illegal. I write.
RICHARD.
After this exciting day in the history
of the bank the conspirators rested.
Their outrageous deal had not yet been
consummated and Frank V. McDonald
made one more appeal to save the Peo
ple's Home Savings Bank from a loss
of $100,000. There was absolutely no
question of the fact that Sherman and
Farnum were deliberately robbing the
bank, but Frank McDonald made one
for appeal for honesty in the following
telegram:
NEW YORK, May 13, 1893.
J. E. Farnum, manager People's
Home Savings Bank, San Francisco:
Father and self protest against the un
just Phoenix Railway bond measure.
Please await my arrival before con
summation. Show Richard this and
telegraph answer immediately.
f. v. McDonald.
The conspirators did not wait for the
arrival of Frank V. McDonald. The
deal was consummated and the People's
Home Savings Bank gave to Moses H.
Sherman $100-,000 for 100 worthless bonds
of the Phoenix Electric Railroad. He
placed upon these bonds, however, his
personal guarantee that he would be
responsible personally for the payment
of the money if the railroad would not.
The bank now had 166 of these bonds
with Sherman's guarantee upon them.
This was the condition of affairs when
the bank failed, and this condition ex
plains why it was that Sherman was
so anxious to wind up the affairs of the
bank after it failed. He wished after
that failure to have some one in charge
who would return to him his guaran
tees and release him from the tremend
ous debt by manipulating the appoint
ment of a receiver and bribing James
Alva Watt.
In passing it is not uninteresting to
reproduce another letter of John E.
Farnum to show beyond the possibility
of doubt how the money of the Peo
ple's Home Savings Bank passed into

This statement is vehemently denied by Mrs. Louise D. Hayward, the

In the Police Court â¢sterday the scavengers Brignoli and Rosso were
charged with violating section 297 of the Penal Code, which provides that
any one attempting to bury a body outsidfe of the regular places of inter

VIEW OF THE NATIONALISTS;:
JOHN DILLON AND FOLLOWERS
HOLD A CONVENTION.
Clancy Tells of the Manner in Which
the Irish National Flag Was
Changed to Green a
Century Ago.
BY J. J. CLANCY, M. P.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
DUBLIN. Nov. 12.â Lord Salisbury's ref
'intrusion" of the 1 nited
Btates Into the Eastern worldâ thereby
mean ng I sed Intentions of the
; i Government in regard to the Fhii- ,
ippfni een extensively commented j
on in Ireland. It is hardly needful to
Btate the view entertained In reference to
it by the majority vi Irish Nationalists.
They a.l least c6nsider it extremely nn
pudent and indicative of the true inward
ness of British policy-England, appar
ently, thinking that no other power but
herself ought to have any interest? in the
to acquire any rights or
possessions in that region. But it is r<Â»i;
ed satisfactory that, for whatever
. England is not inclined to dispute I
tion of America, and it is cons
- â  [rish heart to think that the reason
is that there is such a fleet as that ot Ad
miral Sampson and Admiral Dewey, ana
that the destruction of the Spanish fleet in
the recent war shows unmistakably mat
all the efficiency in naval warfare Is not
on the Bide of England. The naval vic
at Manila and Santiago did a great
roy the naval power
1. 1 Spain. They taught in England a fe
tor the naval power of America
which had not been felt before, lhe re
sult is Lord Salisbury's acquiescence in
any course which America may resolve
to pursue In regard to the Philippines, and
the further result is that America need
fear, as long as she maintains her!
: -its present state of efficiency, any
thing from or on the part of England. In ;
:tion with this matttr. a say:
ssor Goldwln Smithâ an Englishman,
â¢ Toronto â in relation to the U
war between France and England,!
may be apropriately recalled. â¢"Even," he
Id, "in the sad event of war between
i England. [ have no apprehen
sion that foreign forces could be landed in
t.ut I should fear that Ireland
. !>.- the scene of at least an attempt
ision and, what Is the worst part of
it, l am disposed to think the invader
would tit- welcomed bj a section of the
Irish people." Of this fact there can be
no doulit whatever. Even in such places
as the Dublin theaters, the audiences in
which are usually more representative of
the pro-British minority than of the ma
jority in Ireland or in Dublin, when it was
attt mpted during the past week to get up â 
a demonstration In favor of the Sirdar,
g for I.'ml Kitchener of Khar
â .â ...- absolutelj drowned in hisses.
John Dillon. M. "P.. and his followers ,
held a convention a few days ago in this .
city to 'ny down a policy for his party ;
on th< to be observed toward the
minority in the coming local government :
" . tion was decidedly
a sn; â  â¢ was attended only by
-two members of Parliament out \
nly six or eight out- i
Neither Mr. Healy him
r any of his followers attend*
even sent an apology for non-attendance.
Strangest < ireumstance of all, not a
atholic clergyman put in an appear-;
ance. I do ru>t rru-an to suggest thai the
n of the Catholic Bishops and
which has hitherto sui'i
Mr. Dillon and his followers h;ts deserted
them; 1 only mention a favt, whatever be
splanation. The principal busi
done was to make a declaration in favor
of making the coming County Councils j
strongholds of Irish Nationalism: but on
[uestion whether the anti-National
minority should be allowed representation
Jn the new local bodies the derision ar
rived at was not of a very iK-tinite char
one hand. Mr. Dillon an
â¢ d that he had had no intention of
advising hia followers to keep out of the
new councils all competent men belong
ing to thÂ» minority; on the other, a rath
er h< Ing was expressed toward
the grand jury class in general. It is j
right to add that William O'Brien, in a
letter to the convention, repudiated the
construction put upon a former declara
tion of his on this subject that he would, |
â if he had his way, wreck tht- new system
â¢ If-government with a vi- -,s i :
making home rule inevitable. But. on the
whole, it Is, I repeat, difficult to summa
rize In one sentence the policy of Mr. Dil
lon and his followers beyond saying that
they have determined to make the n< w.
councils consist wherever they can effect
that object of Nationlist majorities, and
in this respect they are at one with Mr.
Redmond and his party. The result of
course outside Ulster will be that the
new bodies will be either wholly or main
ly Nationalist. In Dublin. I may add, the'
electoral battle has commenced already,
end here the test question will be wh.-th.-r
there is to be a Unionist or a Nationalist
Mayor for next year. How that
question will be answered is n matt
â which little doubt can be entertained.
The majority of the Nationalists of Dub
tinâthat is, "of the population of Dublinâ |
are Parnellites, and they would gladly
favor the introduction into the corpora
tion of the city of a fair representation
of the anti-Nationalist majority, provided !
the intention of electing a Tory Lord:
Mayor were openly abandoned; but. as
long as that prospect is not abandoned.
the consequence must be that all over the j
t tv only Nationalists will be elected
An interesting discussion on the subject
of the Irish national color has this week
taken place in the Irish National journals,
and the result will no doubt be surprising
to most Irish Nationalists abroad. It
seems that it is only about a century ago
since green became the Irish nationa i
color and that the ancient Irish national
color was blue. How green came to be
adopted instead of blue is explained by
v' r,oorge D. Burtchall. secretary of the
RoYal Dublin Society of Antiquaries. It
Koc-Vns that It was the result of an attempt
to E a Volor which would unite both ;
â VVilliamites and Jacobites in the last cen
tury and as a matter of fact, green is a j
blend of orange and blue. This theory is
borne out by an incident which took place
on the 4th of this very month of Novem
ber 1792. when the Volunteers, desirous of
no longer outraging the feelings of their .
Catholic countrymen, discontinued thean- :
mnl nrocession around King Williams
Statue College Green. Dublin, and ap
peared with green cockades instead of the,
ribbons they had previously worn
Mr Burtchall. I may add. has also had
something interesting to say n bout the
ham without the crown." In the sixteenth
century the "Irish arms" consisted of a
eolden harp on a blue ground, without the
crown The English royal standard is also ;
the harp without the crown, and it is a â¢
factâ although it may appear a strange
oneâ that the uncrowned harp as an em
blem of Ireland is to be found all over the
House of Commons. How, then, did It ;
]'Â|,,;,n that the crown came to be placed
over the harp In Ireland? The. most rear'
Bonable conclusion seems to be that the |
Repealers fifty years aeo adopted the j
crown In addition to the harp for the pur- I
SosTof showing their loyalty to the Brit- ;
Fsh connection. The controversy, of |
course has not much of a practical as
neci but the very fact that such a contro
versy has arisen among persons who
file' not Nationalists is a significant sign
Â°Vhe c /-" es't Irish beauty is Miss Corn
wallls Vv'est. the sister of the already fam
ous Princess Henry of Pless. about whose
exploits the renders of The Call have al
rea.lv been furnished ample information.
This" young lady is said not to belong
either to the learned or the "new" school
of wom.n. I don't know much about her
myself, but I hear she belongs to the old
fashioned type of pretty society girls. It
remains to be seen whether She, too, will i
Â«ot capture a Prince- *

THE LATEST PHILIPPINE FHOSE.
JUST what has been proposed to Spain in re-
I to her sovereignty in the Philippines is j
not known.
From time to time rumors seep out from Paris,
and the nearest to a reasonable conclusion from them
all is that our Commissioners are haggling with the
Spanish representatives over a price to be paid for the
islands and their people. To pay for territory after
we have whipped the nation that owned it has a pre- j
cedent in our settlement with Mexico. But that was
territory .over which Mexican jurisdiction was not
only nominal, but it was land that was untouched by
the hand and untrod by the foot of civilized man. In
all of its vast area the Mexican settlers hardly num
bered into the thousands, and when we made treaty
with Mexico their ownership of the lands they occu
pied was respected and they were made citizens of the j
United States. It is not to be denied that their fate
when their nomadic simplicity was brought in contact
with American shrewdness was such as not to attract
people of their sort into a like companionship. But
in dealing with Mexico we bought unpeopled land
and admitted the few civilized settlers to citizenship.
In the Philippines, however, we are not buying un
peopled land. Human beings swarm there like ants.
As individuals or tribes they own and occupy the
land. They have drained to its sorry dregs the cup
of colonial experience. The few who have gained
:' great wealth are reported in favor of annexation to
this country, in order that their fortunes may be un
der the protection of an American fleet and garrison.
It is said that these rich natives complain of Aguin
: aldo that they paid to him a large sitm of money as a
bribe to support annexation, and that he pocketed
the cash and came out for independence. This inci
dent means that there is Filipino gold ready to pay
for the advocacy of annexation and that Aguinaldo
will not stay bought, because he is in the midst of
the people, wild and tame, wlio want no more colo
nial government.
Notwithstanding the prayer of the few- rich for an
nexation, it is every day clearer that if we buy the
Philippines of Spain we are buying the privilege of
conquesting them. There are ten millions of people
â in those islands, and Spain has had jurisdiction of
only a small minority of them. A modern rifle can
non can fire a shot from the shore and its inward
, range wfll nearly everywhere cover the narrow rim
that has really belonged to Spain. Beyond that are
the tribes which are drawn upon for a fighting force
by the revolutionists, like Aguinaldo, and have been
use 1 time and again to force Spain to pÂ«y for a peace
which she would not conque â  in that climate by arms.
If we are to pay twenty millions, it is just two dol
lars per head for the Filipinos, Buddhists, Moham
medans and all. If they are worth it they ought not
to be sold. If they are not we ought not to buy them.
With their climate as an ally they can make the effec
tive assertion of our jurisdiction cost us ten
times what we pay per head for them. It is amaz
ing that the American people should abandon them
selves to such a hasheesh dream as ownership of
these islands. Senator Morgan aids the delusion by
an. interview in which he vaunts their "vast and im
. measurable wealth." Spain has been exploiting
"them for centuries. She has driven their people to
Kbor performed unwillingly, as all labor in the tropics
is. Their production of hemp, sugar, rice and to
â¢â¢ bacco has been forced by Spain for the benefit of the
' few rich and the Chinese who control th- trade. With
all this forcing the. total trade of the whole archi
pelago, imports and exports, is only thirty-two mil
. Jions of dollars a year. This sum, generated by the
producing and consuming capacity of ten millions of
â  people, so fires the fancy of Senator Morgan that he
sees in it the evidence of "vast and immeasurable
wealth."
California, with but little over one-tenth the num
ber of people, exports forty millions a year of the sur
plus products of her mines, orchards, fields, vine
yards, forests and waters! The Philippines produce a
total trade equal to three dollars and twenty cents
per head of the population,, while California exports
â nearly forty dollars per head!
We invite the attention of Senator Morgan's
sumptuous and tropical imagination to the statistics
of California's trade.
If the people are to pay twenty millions, or two
dollars per head for the Filipinos, who generate a
trade of only three dollars and twenty cents per head,
why not do a little more for California, whose people
produce in exports alone more than twelve times as
much?
The wife of Dreyfus is very ill, a circumstance
which may be regarded as a new triumph for France.
TELEPHONE fIBUSES.
A SUBJECT which should receive attention from
the coming Legislature concerns the secrecy
of telegraphic and telephonic messages. The
law as it exists at present gives business men and
newspapers inadequate protection against eavesdrop
ping and actual betrayal, and it ought to be amended
so as to visit severe penalties upon those who traffic
in the business secrets of others. Such amendment
need repose on no higher plane than ordinary public
policy.
The code now provides that even in judicial pro
ceedings involving life and property the secrets of
attorney and client, physician and patient and priest
and parishioner shall be inviolable; that is to say,
that the lips of these three classes shall be closed
unless they are opened with the consent of the per
sons concerned. The reason for this is founded upon
an enlightened regard for the confidences of man
kind. It is better, says the law, that evil should be
worked now and then than that men should be pre
vented from imparting their secrets to those who es
pecially enjoy their confidence.
The law with respect to telegraphic messages as
bid down by various courts prevents fishing excur
sions among the records of telegraphic corporations.
The only way a litigant can get a telegram on a sub
pena is to name and describe it. Moreover, owing to j
the litigation which is taking place over business
secrets intrusted to their care the telegraph compa
nies are strict with their employes and promptly
punish violations of confidence. It is rare, there
fore, that information contained in a telegram leaks
out, and no change that could be made in the law
would be likely to improve the secrecy that is now
maintained with respect to those communications.
But with telephones it is altogether different. Not
only is it easier for talk to leak than for tickers to be
understood, but no curb at all has ever been placed
upon the operators by the telephone companies of j
California. Everything that goes over the telephone \
wires is public property, and it is reasonably safe to j
say that if a business man in San Francisco were to
telephone his partner in Sacramento that he contem
plated the legal absurdity of attaching the City Hall,
even-body in the State within an hour would know
all about it. The newspapers, whose chief concern
is keeping their information dark until it is published
â news being the valuable commodity in which they j
dealâ have no secrets from the telephone compa- !
Viies. If a man in Los Angeles were to telephone The j
Call that the water lords of that city were about to j
relinquish their grip on the city's works, every news
paper along the line would be in possession of the
information immediately.
This may all be stopped by law. The Legislature
has power to regulate telephone corporations as well
as telegraph companies, and it can enforce secrecy
among the operators of both. We are especially in
terested in the preservation of the property called
news. The general idea seems to be that news re
sembles umbrellas in being the common property of
mankind. But. nevertheless, it is a valuable com
modity, and the newspapers are entitled to have it
protected frorft robbers as well as other business men
are entitled to the protection of their money, dia
monds and watches.
LOCAL RfllLWflY PROJECTS.
BY the construction of the Valley Road during
the years of industrial depression and financial
stringency, the managers of that enterprise not s
only accomplished a great work, but encouraged the
undertaking of other railway enterprises in the State.
The encouragement, indeed, was of a substantial
character, for if railway construction could be made
profitable in the hard times we have just undergone,
it is certain that good results are to be expected of
such work now that we are fairly started upon a new
era of prosperity and business activity.
One of the evidences of coming railway construc
tion is to be found in the reports concerning the long
projected road from Fresno to Monterey. Definite
information is said to have been received that con
tracts have been given for the construction of the
road from Monterey to Hollister, and "semi-official"
authority is quoted for a statement that the work of
building a wharf at Monterey will commence early
in December.
Good reasons exist for regarding these reports as
reliable. It is known that all necessary rights of way
for the proposed road have been obtained through
San Benito County, and it is announced that steps
have been taken toward getting L he right of way
through Salinas Valley to Salinas. It is believed that
no great difficulty will be met in getting the required
right of way, and the people along the line are san
guine the work of construction will begin shortly
| after New .Year.
Active work upon the proposed roa ' will be an
other inducement to the managers of the Southern
j Pacific to fulfill their long neglected pledges to com
j plete the connecting link in their, line of railway
â  through the coast counties. The rights of way across
the existing gap in the line were given years ago
upon a promise that the road would be undertaken
at once and pressed to a speedy completion. The
company, however, has played fast and loose with its
promises and the gap is still open. It will be impos
tible, however, for the old-time monopol to continue
! this policy of stagnation in face of the competition it
will have in the new routes, and that company also
may begin . to display some activity in railway con
! struction before the coming year is ended.
The undertaking of the Fresno and Monterey road,
which is to connect the valley with the sea, will have
the effect of stimulating a similar project in the
j northern part of the State of connecting Humboldt
Bay with the interior. There is a rich region of coun
j try to be opened up in that section of the State by
railroad builders, and now that better times have
come and capital is seeking investment it is not likely
that the advantages of Northern California will be
overlooked, or that enterprising capitalists will ig
nore the profits to be made by assisting in its develop
ment.
Frank Belew's heirs will be enriched by the mur
der he committed. Had Belew been acute he would
have killed the rest of his brothers and gone to the
gallows serenely conscious that the crime of neglect
ing to provide for his little ones could not be charged
I against him.
For swindling the susceptible public two so-called
pugiiists the other night acquired $15,000 each.
'"What fools these mortals be" is still an apt expres

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 27, 1898.
Tlif^T UTAH CONGRESSMAN.
IN the State of Utah women vote and are eligible
to office. At the first State election women were
chosen to the Legislature. They take part, quite
generally, in primary politics, and appear as dele
gates in State conventions, where they are heard as
well as seen.
In the last Democratic State convention, when Mr.
Roberts was proposed as the nominee for Congress,
a lady delegate made a speech against him, in which
she in elaborate detail gave the reasons why he
should not be nominated. She said she was prepared
to prove that he was the father of three children,
whose ages were only a few months apart, the off
spring of plural marriages, or polygamy. The issue
was raised against him during the campaign, and no
answer was made to it, except to charge that it was
merely an appeal to religious prejudice as a force in
politics. He was elected, and now the matter goes to
the next House for test and trial.
The best friends of the admission of Utah to state
hood were opposed to polygamy, and pledged the sin
cerity of the Mormon hierarchy and people in their
abandonment of it. The Tucker-Edmunds law, up
held by the Supreme Court of the United States, had
borne heavily upon the Mormons, and many of them
had performed legal expiation of the offense of
polygamy. Among these Roberts himself had stood
imprisonment, upon due conviction.
To the credit of human nature let it be admitted
that the enforcement of the anti-polygamy law fur
nished many instances of sterling manhood on the
part of the men convicted under it. They refused to
abandon their plural wives to infamy and their chil
dren to the stain of illegitimacy, and while they prom
ised obedience to the law which punished them, made
ample provision for their wives and children.
But Utah was admitted to the Union, with a clause
in her constitution making polygamy a felony and
upon a pledge to enforce it by legislation which would
give the courts jurisdiction. There is a question
among lawyers whether admission as a State ended
Federal jurisdiction over this question. The con
stitution had to be passed upon by Congress, and the
anti-polygamy provision became an act of Congress
thereby. Whether thereafter it became a State mat
ter solely may have to be determined. The people of
a State have always been held to have the sole power
to change and amend their constitution, with the
single limitation that it must conform to the constitu
tion of the United States. The latter instrument docs
not forbid polygamy. The domestic relations are by
it left to State regulation. It did not forbid slavery,
which existed solely as a domestic institution, created
and protected by State constitutions and laws, until
it was forbidden by the thirteenth amendment to the
Federal constitution, which was declared to be rati
fied December 18, 1865.
Since Utah was admitted the rumors of a return to
plural marriages in that State have risen and in
creased. The Gentile population is a small minority
of the whole people. The Mormons, when united,
can control the elections and the State polity without
Gentile alliance and in defiance of the minority sen
timent. If they choose to use this power to return
to a practice which they pledged themselves to aban
don, as a condition precedent to statehood, they can
do so, but they must take the consequences. There
is no way by which a State may be expelled from the
Union and reduced again to territorial subjection.
The proper mode for reaching the Utah ca?e is by an
amendment to the Federal constitution prohibiting
polygamy, to be enforced by appropriate legislation.
This will make it a Federal question, the same as
slavery, and it will be within the jurisdiction solely
of the Federal courts. The discussion of the Roberts
case has called out the expression of some singular
views.
United States Senator Cannon, himself a monog
amist in practice, though a Mormon and the son of
one of the greatest men in the church, has dismissed
the matter by saying that tree coinage of silver, and
not polygamy, was the issue in the late campaign,
and it will do no good to refuse his seat to Roberts
for the State will elect a free silver man in his place.
Of course this is an apparent appeal along political
lines, and seems intended to create the impression
that the opposition to Roberts is really on account of
his financial views.
If this be the Senator's purpose, no clairvoyant
sight is required to see that it is merely special
pleading.
No one cares what the financial views of Mr.
Roberts may be. He is entitled to their possession
and expression. The whole country cares, however,
what his practices in his domestic relations may be.
If he is living in polygamy, in defiance of the funda
mental law of his own State, in violation of the pledge
of the hierarchy of his church, and in defiance of the
moral sentiment of the American people, the House
cannot evade the issue presented. If. on proof of his
offense, the House seat him, it will be taken in Utah
as indorsement of the covert violation of the consti
tution of the State, and what may now be assumed as
a secret relation will come to be practiced as openly
ah it was before the Tucker- Edmunds law prohibited
and punished it.
If Roberts is denied his seat, the next step should
be the reference of an anti-polygamy amendment to
the constitution, for ratification by the States. The
first Republican platform denounced the "twin relics
of barbarism, slavery and polygamy." The party can
only gain by standing by that declaration and adding
to the abolition of slavery the Federal prohibition of
plural marriage.
A threat to put a face on a man has heretofore been
regarded as in the nature of a threat, but New York
surgeons are going to try it, and from che kindliest
of motives. Their subject was incautious enough to
blow his face off with a gun, and the men of science
think they can replace it with one on a celluloid foun
dation. The public's best wishes will attend their
efforts, and yet there is reason to fear the new phy
siognomy will never take a prize at a beauty show.
The best use to make of features is not to blow them
off.
Probably the charge that jewels were stolen from
the linen of a victim of the Baldwin fire and replaced
by worthless imitations are unfounded. Thieves
might have snatched the valuables, but they would
not have lingered in the vicinity long enough to have
done the rest.
At least there is the excuse for fighting over the
estate of James T. Murphy of San Jose that the es
tate is of considerable value, and several people who
would like the spending of it did not happen to be
mentioned in the will.
A Police Judge has just given a wife-beater ninety
days. The sentence is not. generous. Surely the
Judge could have spared another ninety days.
The way creditors are swooping down on Baldwin
reminds one of the circling flight of vultures above a
carcass.
Racing may be a good thing. There may be too

It had v been my purpose to say this

fully true that, dimly remembering the

the proposition that Roosevelt did write

this I was mistaken. It would, seem
that to so write oneself is the way to

Strange questions come to this de
partment, questions clearly designed
for the query editor, who has grown
gray in the acquisition of wisdom and
draws a salary for dispensing it. For
instance, I am asked to give an opinion
as to phrenology. By this term the
ordinary intelligence means craniology,
as taught by Gall and later expounded
by Fowler and others of his school. In
other words, they mean the science of
bumps, which is not a science at all,
but may be a fad or a fraud according
to the understanding of the advocate
thereof. In a general way something
may be told of mental or even of moral
characteristics by the shape of the
skull, yet to dally with the protuber
ances of the dome of thought and essay
from the impression gathered to out
line the worth, the ability and the im
pulses of the subject is, in my estima
tion, as foolish and futile as to feel a
man's biceps and proclaim what he has
eaten for breakfast. The interior sur
face of the skull does not conform to
the exterior surface. The bump on the
outside may be but the visible indica
tion of an osseous thickness fully as
apparent inside. Investigation is ham
pered by the necessity for an autopsy
to determine this point. There are
people with similar heads and wholly
different conceptions of life. There are
people governed by kindred impulses,
yet bearing no cranial resemblance. I
once knew a skeptic to be examined by
a disciple of Fowler, and he was told
that he was lacking in the organ of
veneration. "In fact," said this wise
disciple, "so ftr as religious conception
goes, you are an idiot." Yet this moral
idiot was shortly after that converted
to Christianity and became one of the
most ardent worshipers at the ahrine
of orthodoxy. He developed no new
bumps. There are gentlemen who have,
theoretically, the heads of assassins,
thieves and degenerates, but who are
wholly trustworthy. There are rascals
of saintly conformation, doits with the
brows of a Webster, savants who would
be lost under a No. 7 hat. Therefore,
my faith in craniology is absent. I re
gard it as a little better than palmis
try, because its devotees, with a
strange and interesting confidence,
think that their belief has some basis.
â¢ * *
The same inquirer wants to know the
utility of phrenology in the treatment
of disease. If anybody has an explana
tion I will gladly surrender space to it.
Certainly men have been benefited by
the sudden erection of bumps even by
bo crude an appliance as a rolling-pin.
This however, refers to their moral
betterment.

Once more I wish to protest against
the lingual abortion, "Varsity." There
is no sense to it, no excuse for it. It
offends the senses. We might as rea
sonably call the great scheme in which
we form a petty part a varse.

In a fashion so gentle as to hardly be
a rebuke, I am corrected by Editor
Robertson of the Placerville Nugget
for having expressed sympathy for
young Rosser, now on trial here for
murder. However, that expression of
sympathy had no string attached. To
feel sorry for a man is far from hold
ing him blameless. Knowing himself
possessed of a violent temper, readily
Inflamed by liquor, Rosser should have
remained sober. However, the saloon
keepers who sold him stuff no better
than poison must share, morally, the
burden of his guilt. It is notorious
that the volunteer soldiers here were
lured into dives, doped, robbed and
thrown out. In many instances they
were found wandering penniless about
the streets the night after pay day,
crazy and irresponsible, evidently not
the victims of bad whisky so much as
the victims of drugs administered along
with it. That there were so few bloody
escapades was a stroke of good for
tune. However, this is no plea for
Rosser. The matter is in the courts,
the proper place for its adjudication.

A queer story comes out of Chicago
that women have decided that the silk
skirt must go. They reached this mo
mentous decision at one of the con
gresses which to the feminine soul Is
ever a joy. Similar congresses from
time to time decree that the oorset Is
an evil, the street sweeping dress a
menace to health and destructive of
cleanliness. Undoubtedly the women
are sincere at the moment, but they go
to their several homes, and the first
time they robe for a swell function
have an extra cinch taken in their cor
sets, even if to do so they have to tie
the string to a bedpost. Also they do
not h^.ve the train snipped from the
condemned street raiment, but move
along the pave in trailing majesty,
clearing It of detritus as they go.
Therefore no fears need be felt for the
future of the silk skirt. Long will its
delicately suggestive frou-frou continue
to charm. The silk skirt Is a delight.
The plea that the noise of It racks the
nerves is born of envy. On' the contrary
it soothes the ear. It is charged against
the garment that worshipers are dis
turbed, or the theater audience driven
to frenzy by the racket the tardy lady
makes upon entering. The lady her
self Is to blame. She has no business to
be tardy. Let the fault rest upon her
and not upon her innocent bedecking.
Civilization has not reached that stage
at which it can spare the shimmer of
the visible skirt nor the silken rustle by
which its presence is announced. The
proposed war would not only be fool

The matter-of-fact way In which
great problems are referred to this de
partment would be flattering if they
brought with them any assurance of
ability to furnish the solution. A letter
has just been received asking for an
expression of views as to woman's
rights, woman's suffrage, their mutual
relation, and the relation of both to
the home and to society. One objection
to discussing these matters is the im
possibility of saying anything new con
cerning them. They came into exist
ence in some form shortly after Adam
lost a rib, and varying to suit different
conditions have been in existence ever
since. Probably when the heavens
phall roll up as a scroll and the light of
regions beyond be shed directly into the
material universe its first ray will
search out an advocate of woman's
rights, and the music of the celestial
choir drow> with difficulty the vocife
ration of her opinions. Another objec
tion is that people holding certain views
concerning the subject continue to hold
them. Reason cannot shake them, nor
eloquence appeal. However, the ide,as
of an humble individual, while possess
ing absolutely no value in themselves,
can do no harm, so here goes. If a
woman desires to vote, I cannot think
of an excuse for preventing her, save
the personal regard it is natural for
men to hold towartf her. By asking the
privilege of voting she mars a high
ideal, steps into an atmosphere where
the barriers of veneration which now
shield her are threatened. If she exer
cises the ballot these barriers are swept
away. No person of sense would de
prive a woman of her rights. This is
far from meaning that every man of
sense would eneourr~~ her in an ambi
tion to vote. Women now have every
right, except that of going to the polls.
This would have been given to them
long ago had the best interests of the
nation and of the home demanded it.
Instead of having to seek it, it would
have been thrust upon them. The Su
san B. Anthonys and Anna B. Shaws
are not fair specimens. They have none
of the instincts which make women be
loved of men, lead to the establishment
of the home and gladden the household
with affection that increases with
years. Women have a right to defer
ence and protection. Would they for
feit it? They have the right of reigning
queen over the domestic circle. They
have the right of forming their chil
dren into good and useful citizens. In
many instances this carries with it un
restricted participation in comforts and
luxuries earned and gladW bestowed by
the man. It is his to provide 1 . Certainly
in this joint partnership she should
have equal voice, and usually this is
granted without thought of it being a
concession. In a thousand ways women
are taught that men esteem them.
Even so small a thing as the surrender
of a seat in a street car has its signifi
cance. It is not because men think
women inferior that they object to the
extension of suffrage, but for exactly
the contrary reason. They do not want
woman to come down from her lofty
estate. They want her to remain where
she is, so that she can remain what she j
is. In Colorado, a State in which the |
average of intelligence is high, the j
women can vote as freely as the men. I
The experiment has proved a dismal j
failure. An excess of gallantry, an
overplus of Anthony and Shaw,
brought about the arrangement, and
now the discovery Is made that the
women do not care to vote. They are
not interested in politics, and I hope
they will never be. A man engages in
politics only at the peril of his reputa
tion; he has less to lose than a woman.
If the time ever shall come when the
mothers and wives ask for suffrage
th^y will get it. They can have any
thing it is in the power of man to give.
If they will observe narrowly they will
ascertain that most a man achieves is
to enable him to make some woman
happy. But a Shaw can have only a
negative influence, unless in excep-
tional circumstances. She is a preacher,
a lawyer and a doctor of medicine, as
well as a lecturer drawing fat stipends.
Yet she has the unspeakable nerve to
mount the rostrum and -<-owl that in
this country her down-trodden sex has
no rights. She is, of course, insincere,
since she cannot be accused of foolish
ness. No concern need be felt for the
shouting Shaws. They can take care
of themselves. But for the true woman,
whatever her station, men have a ten
der and. I believe, unselfish regard.
Therefore it seems to me all this agita
tion is superfluous, that it does no pos
sible good and may easily work ill. Let
women be as they areâ sweet, gracious,
superior.
Mormonism seems bent on hara-kiri.
A few years ago the laws on the sub
ject became so strict and their enforce
ment so rigid that the Mormon shunted
his superfluous wives Into the back
ground and made pretense that he was
in a state of single married blessed
ness. Then Utah was admitted as a
State, and the followers of Brigham be
lieved that they were beyond control.
They corraled the stray wives and set
up housekeeping on the old wholesale
plan. Outsiders were not aware of this.
They thought that reform had been
genuine. Thus the polygamists waxed
bold, and, not content with herding the
seasoned wives back to the domestic
pasture, laid in a stock of new ones.
When the time arrived for sending a
man to Congress they selected a polyg
amist whose latest wife was numbered
4 and who had blessed him with a pair
of twins. That his election was an in
sult to the nation, to the decency of its
men and the purity of its women,
needs no saying. Therefore, will the
polygamist be denied a seat in the Con
gress his presence would disgrace and
attention be directed again to the
shameless condition of affairs in Utah.
In the end the erring people will be
driven forth. They do not dovetail
with civilization. Their place is in the
wilderness, where they may be a
statute unto themselves. They had a
chance to mend their ways and ignored
it. Instead of laying aside the degrad
ing customs which make their religion
to be abhorred, they flaunt in the face
of an enlightened people a defiance of
written and unwritten regulations.
Roberts will be refused a seat. So
should all of his kind. But as they will
decline to give up habits disgusting
and unpardonable, in the end they will
seek another place. In this land, where
the integrity of the family relation is
the cornerstone of society, they must
be, so long as they remain, aliens and
strangers.

Profound as. is human respect for the
dead- instinctively as one bares the
head in the still city where friends and
strangers lie sleeping under the bloom
of flowers, there is something inexora
ble about material progress. Its ad
vance cannot be stopped by a marble
shaft, and the most stately mauso
leum can hardly more than stay it
briefly. In the end the grassy avenue
between the tombs becomes the paved
and noisy street. The dust of those
who rest is removed. The marble shaft
rears itself farther from the haunts of
men. The mausoleum, stone by stone,
is rebuilded in another spot. San Fran
cisco has to face the problem which
sooner or later is met by every muni
cipality, and ever with a single result.
When the interests of the quick clash
with the seeming interests of the dead,
the quick prevail. After all, even from
a sentimental point of view, there are
two sides to the question. Is it not
better that our loved ones shall be
placed ia their final peace far from the
busy haunt, away from the mart of
trade, out of sight of the heedless
passer-by? There is something incon
gruous in the presence of a burial
ground where carts and cars go rattling
by. It should be where quiet reigns,
and if sentiment is to guard our dead
let it guard them against the trespass
of those whose summons has not yet
come. It seems to me a pity that any
more interments should be permitted
in the cemeteries about and beyond
which the city is growing. Their fate
is inevitable. Sooner or later they will
be abolished, as this is so, why,
the sooner the better. There will be all
sorts of hindrances, but they will be
futile. A cemetery does not belong in
the center of population and it cannot
remain there indefinitely. My personal
belief is that there should be no burial,
but that the body should by fire be re
duced at once to its original elements,
rather than undergo the slow process
of decay, causing the danger of corrup
tion to the earth and the air. Never
theless, burials will be continued for
many years,, but at least they should
be conducted with a view to the pro
tection of the living and proper respect
to the dead. This cannot be done while
the burial place infringes upon the
ground where press the feet of the hur
rying, careless multitude.

all the cooks and waiters drowned. The
sea did most damage between the main

doors, tore away the railing, lifted the
hurricane deck three inches and did a
great deal of minor damage. A coal
passer named Hillman died three days
ago and was buried at sea.
The steam schooner Aloha while on her
way up Mission Creek to discharge her
cargo of lumber collided with a scow
schooner and did considerable damage
yesterday.
The scow was loaded with hay ana
was discharging her cargo on the hay
wharf. A horse was used to pull the
bales from the schooner's deck to the
wharf and was in the act of hauling
away on the tackle when the crash came.
The scow's bowsprit was carried away,
and all her mooring lines parted. The
hoi'se -was fast to the scow's mainmast
by means of the heaving rope, and as the
vessel was moved along by the force of
the impact the horse had to go, too. When
the mooring lines parted and the schoon
t r moved away from the wharf the horse
was pulled clear overboard. Luckily
there was very little harness on him, so
he was able to swim, and when one of
the deck hands cut the rope that held
him fast to the bale of hay he swam
ashore.
The Samoa was not very much dam
and proceeded to the lumber yard,
while in half an hour the scow was fast
to the wharf again and the horse was
at work hauling away on the bales of

RIGHT TO PLAY QUESTIONED
LOOKS AS THOUGH FAVORITISM
IS DISPLAYED.
Burge Makes the Greatest Catch of
"iears, While the Stands Ap
plaud Him to the
Echo.
By Joe Corbett.
Six days ago, at Recreation Park, the
Athletics and Sand Crabs competed. For
ten long innings they struggled and
fought midst the cheering of multitudes,
only to have the contest declared a draw
by "Umpire McDonald. The score at this
moment stood 6 to 6. The game was hard
and earnestly played, but the fates were
against the men. Darkness set in and
McDonald, as heretofore mentioned, called
the contest with the even score, inflicting
no damage on any one save, possibly, in
the chances the patrons of the game
might have had of witnessing one of the
greatest games of the year. This the
contest promised to be had the fates al
lowed It to proceed. However, they were
generous enough in giving these same two
clubs an opportunity to clear the doubt
that existed in all minds as regards which
team was the better.
yesterday they crossed bats again, and
the Athletics vanquished the Sand Crabs
by the very close score of 3 to 1. It was
not, however, the same Athletic team that
played on Sunday last. They were mighty
in the box yesterday; on Sunday they
were not. The doubt still exists rather
than is silenced. The clubs will have to
meet on the same footing as they did in
that memorable ten-inning contest before
basebalidom will draw final conclusions.
But how is it, asks every one, that Mr.
lberg so mysteriously and suddenly be
came a member of the Athletic team?
How is it, ask these same fans, that Iberg
is permitted to roam from one team to
another at will? Until yesterday he was
indisputably a member of the San Fran
ciscos. He has played in over ten games
with that organization and why he should
be allowed to bob up so serenely and at
such an opportune time is a question I
should like to have explained. It really
looks to me like a put up job to defeat
the Sand Crabs out oÂ£ second money. My
conjectures may be wrong, and if they
are but one conclusion can be arrived at
and it is simply this: The league is man
aged as though a crowd of children was
at its head. In fact, from this late and
most opportune move of Mr. Iberg I am
inclined to believe that a fe-w school boys
could do better.
The league apears to be as devoid of
system and discipline as ft was about
three or four months ago. Just think of
it. A team has a chance for second
money and deliberately takes one <3f the
best twirlers in the league from anothei
club to insure this chance. The league
board, if there happens to be any such
body in existence at the present time,
should put its foot on this sort of thing
and send Mr. Iberg back to where he
came from.
It is not fair or just to permit him to
roam where he pleases and where he can
render sume team invaluable service.
With these two teams fighting for second
place it certainly looks bad, very bad, to
Bee a man of the ability Iberg possesses
going to the assistance of one of the
< lubs. In my opinion the Sand Crabs
have a tremendous kick coming.
1 had almost forgotten about the game,
yet. recollect mentioning that the Athletics
emerged the victors, thanks to Mr. Iberg.
This player, as usual, was almost invin
cible. His work through the entire game
was of thÂ« order that wins nine times out
of ten. The Sand Crabs, try as they
would, could do no better than score one
run, and this from a baseball view strict
ly was a pure gift. With Strieb on third
Whalen started to steal from first to sec
ond. Ldhman threw to second, and Han
ley, who received the ball, paid no at
tention to Strieb, contenting himself with
tunning down Whalen. Had he been on
ihe alert and quick at all he could have
prevented Strieb from crossing that plate,
but Blockera has a poor arm and does not
in consequence care to display his throw
ing propensities. This is the reason why
the Sand Crabs manaÃf-d to secure one
measly run. They should have been shut
out, but the beating as it stands is severe
enough.
Again, they did not play up totheirusual
form. Whalen, who occupied the pitcher's
department, was alarmingly wild at tne
outset. Three men were given free trans
portation to first in the inrtlal inning ow
ing to his inability to locate the plate.
Alter filling the baserf, however, he pulled
himself together and allowed only one
run. In the next inning two more were
scored off him. Yet the blame cannot be
laid directly ;it his door. From then on he
did well, but was supported in a most
wonderful manner by Sir Burge, the acro
batic right-fielder. This individual cov
ered himself with so much glory that he
was barely visible. To him must be given
the credit of making the greatest catch
Been in California in years. With one man
out, Johnson hit a long drive into right
center. With a burst of speed as wonder
ful as was the catch, he started for the
ball, and Just as it w.us about to disappear
In the seats erected for the purpose of
accommodating the football cranks leaped
in the air and brought it down with nis
ungloved hand. Immense applause greet
ed the performance, and it c*ontinue'l
every time the boy came near the stand.
Later on in the contest he made another
sensational catch and threw to the piute,
both of which performances received tu
muituous applause.
Outside of Burge's great work, the play
ing of the Sand Crabs, while steady at
times, was nothing to really brag about.
Their opponents outplayed them at all
stages save in right garden; yet it is a
question whether they would have won
with Fitzpatrick in the box. Laying asidf 1
the Iberg episode, the game was a clever
onÂ« and interesting. Those who saw it
were not dissatisfied by any means; but
the crowd was awfully slim. To-day
however, it will improve. The score is
as follows:

PHILBROOK S PETITION DENIED.
! Is Refused Permission to Practice in
the Supreme Court.
Horace W. Philbrook, the ex-attorney,
has received another setback at the hands
of the Justices of the Supreme Court. In
! 1895 he did not like a decision of one of the
: Justices (Harrison), and In a brief filed
with the clerk of the court made disre
spectful reference to the gentleman on the
i bench. For this he was haled before that
i tribunal and disbarred from practicing
! there again. For a long: time -Attorney
! Philbrook amused himself by writing
| pamphlets, in which he scored the mem
1 bers of the Supreme bench in a rough
! manner. The disbarred lawyer recently
i made another effort to obtain forgive
j ness in the following language:
! To the Supreme Court of the State of Cali-
I fornia: I request that the Judgment of dis
â¢ barment made against me in this proceeding on
the sth day of January, 1595, be vacated, and
that this be done in suitable and Just language
to be published in the California Reports.

his notes too well. It was common talk
that Ventoro was sore and not at his best
and First Tenor had a strong call In the
betting, going to the post a 7 to 10 favor

was possessed of a large bottle of speed,
which he uncorked and let flow during the

Won easily. Second and third driving*.
The track suited Faversham. He Is not of much account. My Dear ran consistently.
In better hands she might run faster
After many trials and vicissitudes Lime
water managed to win a purse. - Going
into the starter's hands a 9 to 5 favorite
for the opening flve-furlong scramble tor
two-year-olds the colt, through Piggott'a
superior riding, beat Sam McKeever a
nose ' on the wire. Of the others, Rio
Chico was best, and got the show.
The surprise of the day was the down
fall of Lodestar, the 1 to 4 favorite for tne
mile selling affair. Thorpe waited with
him until the midnight hour, and was then
outfooted by. Corrigan's gelding, G. B.
Morris, backed from 7 to 5 to 1. The win
ner covered the distance in 1:43, and if
Lodestar can repeat no better than yes
terday's race would indicate he should be
consigned to the hack service.
The best of society was Sown on Wheel
of Fortune to win the mile and a 'six
teenth run, and "Skeets" Martin sat on
the back of the jaunty matron. Nine to
10 was offered about her, and though she
ran quite up to expectations, Cromwell
ran better, and was first over the line by
a neck. The winner made all the running,
and Jockey Bullman furnished one of his
star efforts. Adam Andrew, at long odds,
was a distant third.
Report had Pat Dunne's gray horse Paul
Griggs taking to his work kindly, and the
seven-furlong event proved quite easy for
him. An even money choice, he forged to
the front the last furlong, and holding
Yankee Doodle, the second choice, safe,
won by nearly a length. Novia, after
cutting out the pace, found the distance
too far, and was led out for the show by
Cabrillo. â¢
Seven maiden two-year-olds were un
loosened in the concluding race: of tne
day, a four and a half furlong scramble.
Billy Randell's Montana-bred gelding. Sil
ver Beaux, was played from 7 to 5 down
to even money, but succumbed to Faver
sham, which came from the rear, winning
by two lengths. Don't Tell was third.

It Is now conceded by eminent sci-
entists that the most important organs
of the whole body are the kidneys.
They filter your blood and work away
night and day, whether you sleep or are
awake.
People are apt to believe that kidney
! disease Is a rather rare disease, but re-
cent discoveries have proven that it is
a most common trouble.
And the proof of this is that most dis-
eases, perhaps 85 per cent, are caused
in the beginning by disorders of the
kidneys.
BECAUSE they fail to filter your
blood.
You cannot be sick if your blood is
p Ure â free from kidney p^i^on and dis-
! ease-breeding germs.
The treatment of some diseases may
' be delayed without danger, not so with
kidney disease.
When your kidneys are not doing
their work it will be manifested by pain j
or dull ache in the back, rheumatic
pains sciatica, sediment in the urine, j
scanty supply. scalding irritation in
passing it, obliged to go often during |
the day and to get up duriner the night, j
uric acid, sleeplessness, nervousness, j
irritability, sallow, unhealthy com- ,
plexion, puffy or dark circles under the j
eyes, loss of energy and ambition.
PRESENTED A
FORGED ORDER
OF RELEASE
Judge Conlan's Name
Was Utilized.
THE ATTEMPT FRt^TRATED
Two of the Trio Are Well Known to
the Police and One of
Them Is an Ex-
Convict.
Through a clumsy attempt to forge the
name of Judge Conlan to an order for the
release of a prisoner three men were yes
terday booked at the City Prison on a
charge of forgery.
Early yesterday morning Policeman
Pyle, whose beat is on Larkin street, over
heard three men talking about forging an
order. He watched them and saw them
enter a saloon on the corner ot Larkin
and Fulton streets. He then went 10 the
City Prison and notified Corporal Parrott,
the doorkeeper, of his suspicions. In a
few minutes the trio called at the prison
and one of them, who was recognized as
Frank Deering, an ex-convict, presented
the order to Parrott while the other two
remained outside. Parrott called them in
and when the order was presented by
Parrott to Desk Sergeant Brown he at
once saw that the Judge's name had been
forged The order called for the release
of Lizzie Hanley, alias Coyne, alias
O'Connor, who was arrested on Thanks
giving day with P. J. Hanley, her alleged
husband, for drunkenness. Hanley at the
time put up $5 for his own release, which
was forfeited. Hanley and Emmet Calla
fhan were the two who remained outside,
n the order drunkenness was spelled
"drunkkinneÃÃ," and instead of writing
"O. R." across the face of the oraer "O.
K." was written.
The trio were locked up in the tanks,"
and yesterday morning the matter was
called to the attention of Judge Conlan,
who instructed Pyle to swear to war
rants for their arrest on a charge of
forgery. The trio told a trumped up
story of being in a saloon on Market
street when an unknown man called them
out and said he would get Judge Conlan
to sign an order for Jfe^which Hanley
paid nim. In half an hcrar the man re
turned with the order and they took it
to the prison. They denied being in the
saloon on Larkin and Fulton streets, but
were subsequently recognized by the bar
tender, who stated that he saw Callaghan
writing out the order.
Deering bears a bad reputation and
Hanley is his equal. The latter is now out
If your water when allowed to remain
undisturbed for twenty-four hours
forms a sediment or settling or has a
cloudy appearance, it is evidence that
your kidneys and bladder need Immedi-
ate attention.
Swamp-Root Is a vegetable remedy,
the great discovery of Dr. Kilmer (the
eminent kidney and bladder specialist),
and has truly wonderful restorative
powers over the kidneys. It will be
found by both men and women just
what is needed in all cases of kidney,
liver, bladder and uric acid troubles.
Swamp-Root will set your whole sys-
tem right.
The best proof of this is a trial, and
nothing could be fairer than the offer
to send a sample bottle of this great
remedy and a book telling all about it,
both sent absolutely free by mail to
any address.
The great discovery. Swamp-Root, Is
so remarkably successful that our read-
ers are advised to write for a free sam-
ple bottle and to kindly mention San
Francisco Sunday Call when sending
their addresses to Dr. Kilmer & Co.,
Binghamton, N. Y.
If you are already convinced that
Swamp-Root is what you need, you can
get the regular fifty-cent and Otte dollar
bottles at the drug stores.

perior Court on a charge of grand lar
ceny. October 31 he was held to answer
by Judge Mogan. He was accused of
stealing a diamond stud from John F.
Tighe in a saloon on Market street. The
woman in the case is also a notorious
character.
The police would like to know where or
how the blank order of release was ob
tained, as they are supposed to be in the
custody of. the Police Court clerks.

INROADS OF DREAD DISEASE
DEATHS AVERAGE THREE IN
NUMBER A DAY.
11l and Homesick Soldiers Yet Com
plain That They Receive No
Reading Matter From
the States.
BY CORPORAL FRED A. HEALY.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
MANILA. Oct. From the dally
papers we receive by each mail we
Bee long accounts of the sickness
and death attending: upon, the army
of Cuba, but never a word is
whispered concerning- the illness preva
lent down here. And yet we have ill
ness, and plenty of it. This. is a land of
promise and pestilence. Fair as the
Garden of the Lord, filled with sun
shine, fruit and flowers, it appears to
the first graze of the traveler from more
northern and more inhospitable climes
an island paradise. Yet in its every
beauty there lies a hidden danger, in
its every perfection there will be found
death. Contagion is on every hand. It |
arises from out the sun-kissed flower
beds that carpet the entire island; it
drops down from the starry heavens in
the gentle mists that shadow the light
of the moon that at night seems to
hang, like a lambent flame, midway
between earth and heaven; it floats
upon the limpid waters of every one of j
the thousand streams that, rising
amid the fastnesses of the blue moun
tains that tower in the interior dis
tance, force their way to join together
In a grand expanse of bay, from which
infected shellfish are drawn and sold
In the markets.
There is sickness in the heat of the
noonday sun, there is death in the mi
asmas of the night. Fever comes with
the dryr.ess; more fever is ail that
is brought with the rains. One sleeps,
eats, walks, drills and passes his whole
existence down in this beautifu!, ac
cursed land in a continual atmosphere
of fever, smallpox and dysentery. The
consequence is that every hospital â and
there are many â is filled tv overflowing,
and the dead march is heard almost as
often as the bugle call. It has got so
that a common query every morning is
as to the number that have answered
the call to eternal assembly the night
before. I say night befure, for it is
when the shadows are the darkest and
the candle flame burns most faintly in
its socket, when the light has almost
faded and everything grows dim, that
the weary spirit of the tired, lonely
Eoldier goes forth to juin the comrades
that beckon to him from the other side.
Fever and dysentery are the most
prevalent maladies, though smallpox
has claimed nine victims out of a total
of only thirteen cases. This is a per
centage of mortality for that disease
that is alarmingly high, and every one
Is congratulating himself on the fact
that apparently the spread of the
disease, owing to the excellent work
which has been accomplished by Dr. A.
P. O'Brien, who is in charge of all the
smallpox cases, has been checked. A
curious fact in connection with the
deaths of those who died from the ef
fects of this evil Is that every one of
them had been vaccinated but a short
time before they contracted the illness
which resulted in their death, and in
each case the vaccination took effect
in a satisfactory manner. This is
something for the medical fraternity at
home to ponder over and argue about.
The other two evils which are most
attendant on our army here â fever
Of a malarial-typhoid nature and
dysentery â while not as terrible in their
results as the dreaded smallpox, yet are
- quite bad enough to become a problem
for the most serious consideration of
our medical staff. The hospitals, as I
said before, are crowded to their ut
most capacity, while hundreds out
side of them are ill and unfit
for duty in their quarters. The
deaths average about thiee every
twenty-four hours, and yet the sickly
season has not commenced. One of the
worst features of illness in this part of
the world :.- thar when the danger of
death has passed the patient does not
recuperate as he would in his own cli
mate. He gets to a certain stage of
convalescence where he is not danger
ously ill, yet where he is very, very
weak and far from well, and there he
remains in a condition that renders him
perfectly useless to his country (should
he be called upon to undergo any active
campaigning, such, for instance, as
preceded the fall of this city), and a
misery to himself, with the fÂ°ar ever
upon him of becoming, like many of
the Spanish soldier he sees loafing
about, anaemic and good for nothing
for the re; t of his life.
There aie hundreds of men down here
r."\v in thu condition I have described
who when they left home were as fine
specimens of young American manhood
as one would wish to B< full of
youth, strength, energy and enthu-
Kia.su . Now they drag themselves
around like decrepit old men, with
their spirit as well as their .strength
gone. A change to th*Â»ir own climate
will set many of them on their feet
again, but there are many more who,
I much fear, will feel for the balance
of their lives the effects of th<:ir Manila
campaign.
This general illness cannot be as
cribed to any lack of attention on
the part of the medical authori
ties down here. They are doing all in
their power to alleviate distress, but the
Ulnesa Is in the very atmosphere we
breathe, and nothing in thÂ« power of
man can divert it. The medical men
among us complain of the lack of suffi-.
cient supplies. Whether these com
plaints are or are not well founded I
am unable to say, but from what I
have seen I Imagine that the Govern
ment at home has beenfcibout as tardy
in the matter of drugs as it has been in
everything else.
The place is beginning to fill up with
Americans of all sorts, and not a
few women of the best class, offi
cers' wives for the most part, have
already arrived, bringing news of
many more to come in the near future.
Though we of the rank and file are de
barred for the most part from the so
ciety of these good women, yet even
them on the streets and to know
thai they are about is something of a
satisfaction. The Red Cross ladles, un
der the leadership of Mr. Schlott, have
got to work and are doing an immense
amount of good. There are two nurses
who have been with the California
boys from the start, whose labors have j
been unceasing, and who have made J
themselves simply invaluable. They
axe Messrs. Lewis and Waage. They
worked day and night; day in and day
out they kept it up, until the strength
of one, Mr. Lewis, entirely gave out
and he was forced to return home in
I order to save his own life. Waage is
i Btll] with us. He works all day and un
| til far into the night, and seems to be
E'ssed of an iron constitution which
ing can break. Father Doherty,
'aulint priest who accompanied the
is down here, has also been forced
turn to the States, his health hav
ntirely given out. The work done
jth himself and Father McKinnon
.-imply splendid, and by con
\s ith some of the other regimental
men they stand out prominently,
task has been too arduous for
to take hold of and they will
on a mission of comfort and mer
midnight as cheerfully as at any
hour, nor do they care whether it
leads them into the headquarters of a
general or the hospital of the leper or
smallpox patient. Dr. McCarty's hos
pital for the beys of our regiment is
now an established fact out on a pleas
ant site on the seashore in the district
of Hermita, where the salty, strength
giving ocean breezes blow all day and
where the fine accommodations pro
vided fur them and the good atten
tion they ;ire sure to receive will do
all for them that can be done in this
climate. The hospital is large and
comfortable and already all the sick in
quarters have been gathered together
and sent out there. The Scandia is in
the bay and is being put in order to re
ceive patientÃ, as she is to be used as
a hospital ship. The boys are all figur
ing on an early return home though I
am afraid they will be disappointed
from the 'way things look down here.
Diplomatic procedure is slow and the
weeks are likely to lengthen into months
before the boys see the foggy but be
loved coast of their native shore again.
In the meantime Death goes merrily
on reaping his harvest and when the
official report of the fatalities is re
ceived at home the peans of victory
which are now resounding throughout
the land will be changed to dirges and
the voice of Columbia will be heard
mourning for her children and refusing
to be comforted because they are not.
There is one thing which no one
seems to have thought of. the want of
which is so much felt down here that it
almost amounts to a necessity. That
is good reading matter. Almost every
Vhas an old magazine or a novel or
lying around the house. Thesecould
gathered together and sent down
here where they would be valued at
their weight in gold. If i.ny one starts
any such movement, let him be sure
they are sent in such a way that they
will* to a certainty reach the regiment.
The officers and enlisted men are con
tinually receiving word by letter of
delicacies, comforts and articles of
wearing apparel which have been sent.
Yet they often fail to arrive at. their
destination.
The soldier seems to be legitimate
prey for every one, and comforts which
are meant for loved ones at the front
often go into stomachs still bilious !
with the richness of San Francisco grill
rooms.
A bulletin was posted in front of
the Spanish newspaper office last
night informing the public that the
United States had decided to return the !
islands to the dominion of Spain.
Great was the resultant excitement un
til it was ascertained that the story
was a fake, the Spanish paper merely
attempting a little yellow journalism
and copying the methods of some of its
trans-Pacific contemporaries.
I am not a moralist â far from it â but
there is one thing I would advise
mothers to do in the future, and that
is to keep their sons, if under 20 years I
of age, at home until war reaches such
proportions that it becomes imperative
for all to go. Army life, while it will
do much toward making a man out of
some young fellows, proves the utter
ruination of many. Especially is this
true in the case of boys who are too <
young to have seen anything of dissi
pation at home and who in garrison
in a foreign land are loosed from the ,
leading strings for the first time. There
are few good women of their own race
in the land where they are stationed, j
and even these few are so far removed
from an enlisted man that their In
fluence is not felt; there are no even
half-way decent places of amusement
to which they can s:o; the language
they hear about them is that of a for
eign tongue, thus preventing anything
In a social way with the natives of the
place; there Is no reading material to
be had; there are no games such as
checkers, dominoes, etc., and the few
packs of cards to be found in garrison
are used exclusively for gambling pur- j
poses. In fact, the only places open to j
them for recreation and relief from the
terrible monotony of the barracks are
the saloons and the brothels.
In every army there are many "hard
cases" whom nothing can spoil, and it's j
a dollar to a dime that the young boys ]
fresh from a good home will pick out j
one of these fellows for a chum instead J
of one of the better men, in whose com
pany he would at least learn to dissi
pate with discretion, if nothing more.
The young fellow gets the idea that to
be a soldier he must be a ba;l man, and
the more he 'drinks, carouses, curses!
and gambles the more of a man he is. I
The consequence is that by the time |
his term of enlistment has expired he j
has become a rough of the first water, j
and in many cases a confirmed drunk
ard in the bargain. I don't intend this
for a lecture on morality, for I have j
not been much of a Sunday school i
teacher myself, and penance rather
than preaching should be- in my line.
But I do dislike to see young fellows,
some of v.'horn I knew at home, who
have yet two or three years to go be
fore gettin w out <-f their teens, becom
ing not even fast gentlem n, but com
mon gin drunks and whose lives are
in some instances ruined ere they have
fully commenced. Don't let thosA who
read this artielÂ» misunderstand me.
Not all nor even the majority of the ;
regiment is going to the demni- j
tion bow-wows. Most of the fellows are
as fine, healthy minded and pure-mor
aled men ns can be got together in the
way a regiment is recruited.
Numerous / lericans are continually
arriving here and looking around
for good apartments on the ground
fioor. The fecundity of ther-e islands j
is surely something surpassing be
lief, minerals lending their treasures
to swell the richness of the ag- ;
ricuitural abundance and the prom- '
ise of a mighty commerce throw- \
ing- a golden halo over all. It is !
a country where, taking the climate j
into consideration, the chances for the ;
prosperity of the posterity of the orig- !
ir.al settler* ai2 excellent. How much
this statement may please those con
templating becoming original settlers I
am unable to pay.

FATHER McKJNNON'S GOOD WORK AS
SUPERINTENDENT OF MANILA SCHOOLS
Educational System for the F jli P jnos Which) tf)e California ChaplaiQ
Is Takjog Steps to faithfully Carry Out,
MANILA, Oct. 21.â The above photograph is one recently taken In
Manila, showing Rev. Father McKinnon, chaplain of the California Vol
unteers, in his new position of superintendent of the municipal schools
of this city, surrounded by the able staff of men and women he has gath
ered under his authority, and whose business it is to preside over the dif
ferent schools and teach thj young Filipinos.
The school system- as it exists at present in Manila does not provide
for the teaching of English nor have any other innovations in the order
of things prevailing before the investment of the city been as yet at
tempted. The schools have merely been rescued from the state of chaos
into which everything, both public and private, was thrown by the recent
war, and have again been started on about the same lines upon which
they were run in the days when the Spaniard and not the American was
the master. The teachers' salaries are paid by the United States Govern
ment, as is also the rent of the buildings in which the schools are situated.
The furniture, etc., is that formerly used by the Spanish authorities.
Education has not yet arrived at that point where school attendance is
compulsory, but it will eventually have to be enforced if anything is to
be accomplished, as the laziness of the young Filipino is only exceeded by
the indifference of his parents, the two traits together making a com
bination at which a Hypatia could play and lose. The entire number of
schools in Manila is about thirty, situated in the different districts into
which the city is divided, the average being two teachers, a principal and

one assistant, to each school. Schools for boys and girls are run separate
ly, the one being presided over by male and the other by female teachers.
These teachers are for the most part mestizos, that is, they are of half
blood between the island aborigine and some other race. The second half
may be anything from Chinese to Esquimaux. They are all fairly well
educated in both Spanish and native and not a few of them are highly
polished, having received the finishing touches to their educations in the
best colleges and convents of Paris and Madrid. It is nothing unusual to
drop into the home of one of the better class mestizo families and be en
tertained by excellently sung French, Spanish and Italian operas, the fair
singer playing with excellent skill and technique her own accompani
ment on the piano, reserving her accomplishments on harp or guitar for
a later hour, when the moon lends its enchantment to songs of a less diffi
cult, yet more pleasing nature.
These teachers take kindly to the new order of things, and it will be
only a short time before the First California Volunteers can point with
pride to an excellent school system, of which the energy and executive
ability of their chaplain have made them able to boast.

DARK PICTURE IS
DRAWN BY BUTLER
Havana Described as a
Pesthole.
FILTH, SQUALOR, DESTITUTION
POORER CLASSES WHO MUST RE
CEIVE AID.
The Evacuation Commission Thinks
All Spanish Troops Will Have
Departed Before the Date
Fixed in Agreement.
Sp/clal Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 28.â General M.
C. Butler of Smith Carolina, a member
of the Cuban Evacuation Commission,
arrived ip-day from Havana in re
sponse to a telegraphic summons from
President McKinley, and this afternoon
he had a two hours' co-nsultation with
the President at the White House.
General Butler gave it as his opinion
that all the Spanish troops will have
departed ten days before the date fixed
in the agreement. He says the Span
iards have met the American Commis
sioners with reasonable fairness, and
that there has been little friction. Some
of the claims they have made for com
pensation for Spanish property have
been ridiculous and they will, of course,
be abandoned in the end. General But
ler denies all the reports of dissension
among the members of the American
Commission.
General Butler is of the opinion that
the military government must be con
tinued for some time, but that it should
only be as rigorous as may be neces
sary to preserve order. He thinks the
CubanÃ are ambitious for self-govern
ment and anxious to avoid friction with
the American authorities. If military
control is exercised with discretion he
believes there will be little trouble.
One of the most troublesome features
of the situation is the criminal class,
and the difficulty of determining, in the
case of prisoners who are incarcerated
for political offenses and who for crime.
There has existed in Havana in the
past an oath-bound organization on the
order o-f the Italian Mana, known as
the Nenigo, which was a source of ter
ror to the inhabitants. One of the few
commendable acts of Weyler was the
deportation of about 700 of the members
of this organization to the penal colony
of Ceuro. But fears are expressed that
these criminals may return or that the
order may be revived by some of those
who were not deported.
General Butler describes the sanitary
condition of Havana now as a pesthole,
filled with unmentionable filth, squalor
and destitution. The Spanish authori
ties have, however, agreed to inaugur
ate the work of putting the city in
sanitary condition, with the aid of the
municipal authorities, and work to this
end is to begrin at once. General Butler
paints a dark picture of the destitution
among the poorer classes, and says it
will probably be necessary for us to
furnish some aid to the starving
wretches.

TWO PRETTY SCHOOLGIRLS
Being Slowly Poisoned to Death by
Coffeeâ A Mother's Story.
"Our daughter Maud gradually be-
gan to show more and more nervous
trouble during her school days last
spring, and it came to such a pass that
she was not making the progress de-
sired, and was so terribly nervous that
except by the utmost effort she could
not pit still, or get her mind upon her
work. One evening I asked her what
in the world ailed her, and told her to
put her lesson aside until morning, so
j^JiS^^^

that she could rest. She said, 'No,
mother, I must get this lesson to-night
and be up early to get another in the
morning. I don't know why it is,
but I have been falling behind my class
for over six months, and I must work
in order to graduate this spring. I be-
lieve I will go and make me a cup of
strong coffee, that will brace me up. 1 So
a good cup of coffee was made and
Maud got through with her lessons at
11 o'clock.
"The next morning I heard a rattling
nt the stove about half-past 4 and went
down to find Maud there building a
lire. She said she could not sleep and
that she had to study, so she thought
she would make some coffee, as it help-
ed her the night before. I went back to
. ith a heavy heart, for there was a
thought of danger creeping in. Step by
my mind went back over the last
and the acts of our dear daughter
during that time passed before me like
a panorama. She used to be so well
and happy, but now she acted as if she
was almost crazy with nervousness and
a wreck of her former beautiful self.
It dawned upon the mother's mind that
Maud was fading away, and, looking to
God, I breathed a silent prayer to the
dear father to save my child.
"The next morning I started nut to
consult the family physician, but Just
at the door I met a neighbor's daugh-
B h"r way to school. A year ago
this young lady had been confined to
her bed for months with nervous pros-
tration, and it was whispered about
that if shft lived she wouid be likely to
her mind. Her parents sent her
to a village near by. and this
he first time I had seen her since
her return. I saw that she was the pic-
ture of health, and I said, 'Why, Fan-
aie Prayer, what have you been doing
with yourself? I never saw such a
Change in my life. She answered,
â¢Why you know I finally found out
that "the coffee I was drinking was ruin-
intr me, and when I got out to auntie's
she took the coffee away entirely and
gave me I'<stum Cereal Food Coffee.
That Is the only thing I have had, and
you can see what the result is. I am
Just as well as I can possibly be, and
getting along beautifully with my
School work.'
"I was so deeply impressed with Fan-
nle's experience and her former condi-
tion tallied so closely with Maud's that
I abandoned my proposed trip to the
physician's and went instead to the
grocer's and secured a package of Pos-
tum. That night Maud had Postum
Food Coffee instead of .offee and the
next morning the dear child said she
had slept and was very much refreshed.
The effect was so Instantaneous that I
was very mu'h surprised and feared
perhaps there might be some medicines
in I'oÃtum, but I have since been assur-
ed that it contains no medicines what-
ever, but that on the contrary it is
made of pure cereals, so handled by
skilled exports in its manufacture that
the delicate small particles of phos-
phate of potash are retained in a natu-
ral state as found in certain parts of
the cereals, and that this, together with
the albumen in food, goes quickly to
work to rebuild the nervous system.
Our daughter has been saved to us. She
graduated with honor, and instead of
the nervous wreck she was at one time,
she is now the picture of bounding

run counter to the will of his superiors.
It is a matter of common notoriety
here that the medical department
of this army has been and is being
sadly mismanaged. What is to be
gained by keeping this truth from the
people at home? On the contrary, much
is to be gained by making the fact
known. This army is losing more men
now by disease than it ever lost in bat
tle, and if so small a thing as a change
of management will. remedy this condi
tion, then in God's name let us have
the change. Colonel Lippincott, who is
the medical director, is a lovable old
gentleman. He does not mean any
harm. His intentions are all of that
kind going to make up the pavement of
hell. At the same time he does not
seem able to grapple with the problem
confronting him in a way to give men
confidence that the solution rests in
his power. Colonel Lippincott is an
army doctor, strong solution traditions
wer. Colonel Lippincott is an
doctor, strong in the traditions
of the army. That, ossibly, is the rea
son he overlooks men in the volunteer
service whom years of practice have
fitted to grapple with the ills that af
flict the men here now, and placed the
direction of his hospital for the most
part in the hands of young regular
army men, whose experience at army
posts has been of the kid glove and
lancers kind. Anybody who knows any
thing about the regular army in time
of peace knows how much and how lit
tle the practice of a doctor at an army
post amounts to. There may be a few
Ithe practice of a doctor at then,
t amounts to. There may be a few
es of cramp colic now and then, a
case of delirium tremens say once a
year, an accidental shooting and now
and again a birth in the married quar
ter. The regular army doctor who can
select a sergeant writing a good clerky
hand and capable ef keeping up his re
ports in excellent shape is esteeemed a
cracker-jack by his superiors. Of gen
eral practice he .mows nothing at all.
And it is general practitioners, not sur
geons, who are wanted here now. VV c
have, as the readers of The Call know,
some of the most talented physicians of
San Francisco with the volunteers here.
The question of rank has nothing to do
with it What difference does it make
to a man suffering from typhoid or
smallpox or dysentery whether the man
who prescribes for him has one bar or
an eagle on his shoulder straps?
And the way the medical supplies
have been purchased and the way they
have been doled out is a scandal of
itself I do not know who inspected
these' supplies. Whoever did will have
se' supplies. Whoever did will have
more than one murder to answer for.
Let me tell you of a case within my
own knowledge: An officer, a lieuten
ant, is lying ill at this moment of,
typhoid fever in the Red Cross hospital.
He is dangerously 111. If you know any
thing at all of typhoid fever you will
know that the whole of the intestinal
tract becomes inflamed and sore; that
the walls of the intestines are so thin
there is constant danger of perforation
and consequent sudden death. The
slightest obstruction in the bowels may
cause death to supervene. For this
reason only liquid nourishment is given
to typhoid patients, and that in small
quantity. It became necessary for the
attending physician to give quinine,
and a small dose was ordered. The
nurse gave the only form of quinine
furnished to the army, in small, hard
tablets. Two of these were administer
ed, and by a miracle the patient
swallowed them without fatal re
sults. The tablets had not been even
softened. How many typhoid patients
have died them without fatal re
. The tablets had not been even
ned. How many typhoid patients
died in the general hospital,
where there are hardly nurses and doc
tors enough to go around, by reason of
the inability of the system to throw off
the pellets will never be known. They
do not hold post mortems down here
climatic conditions are against it.
And then there is the case of the
smallpox scare we are now just pass
ing through. The plague, which first
struck the Minnesota boys, coming:
from a native laundry, where a mother
nursing at the breast a baby with the
disease was found washing the clothes
of the regiment, we were told was only
smallpox in the mildest form. In real
ity it is black smallpox, from which
there is no record of the recovery of a
white man in this climate. The disease
is most virulent. That is shown by the
fact that of thirteen cases in the pest
house eight have died and the rest have
not the least chance of recovery. I
wanted to cable you this fact yesterday
and was told coolly that there had been
only six deaths and that I would not
be allowed to send the matter anyway.
I do not know whether the official re
ports of the progress of the disease
were falsified. I do not suppose they
were. Hospital authorities in military
hospitals are delicate of their reports.
Their "paper work" Is their pride and
joy. But at all events I am sure of my
facts. The disease is now under con
trol. I hope and believe, but you will
see that the military reports will bear
me out when Congress asks for them
and they come to be published.
Now, I do not charge Colonel Lippin
cott with being a party to the pur
chase of cheap drugs. I do not charge
Colonel Lippincott with anything. That
is not my province â and, besides, there
is no need. But let me relate an in
cident which occurred at the pesthouse
the other day. '.' , r :
"I hope," said Colonel Lippincott,
speaking to one of the attendants at
the place, "that you are very careful
of your healthâ that you take all pos
sible steps to avoid contagion."
"Yes, sir," was the answer. "I wash
myself in alcohol and â "
"In alcohol," interrupted the medical
director, amazed, "but that is very ex
pensive. Can you not use something
cheaper?"
Alcohol, it would appear, is more
valuable than the life of a manâ even
of a man brave enough to volunteer
his services to army smallpox patients.
There is not a great deal to be said
about Colonel Lippincott aftef that.
Some stories, you know, tell themselves.
Before I leave this smallpox business
I want to say just a word in commen
dation of the noble self-sacrifice of Dr.
A. P. O'Brien of the First California
Volunteers, who has crone to live at the
pesthouse. taking charge, and who is
working almost against all hope to save
the lives of the unfortunates there.
Also perhaps it is well to tell how
young Horace Powers, one of the First
California Regiment recruits and the
only man in his regiment to get small
pox, came to contract the disease. He
had been sent to the general hospital
suffering from mumps. The man in the
bed next to him the doctors were treat
ing for measles. That man went to the
pesthouse and died of silfcllpox, and
Powers followed him there and also
died. I am not enough of a doctor to
know who is â¦Â« blame in a case like
that. That somebody should be held
accountable would seem to be in accord
with the scheme of the eternal fitness of
things.
One thing is very certain concerning
this American army at Manila. The
men now here must be taken out of the
city forthwith and put on high ground
or they must be ordered home. If the
United States holds the Philippines
they must be held by troops c ? some
kind who can endure the climate better
than the lads now here. In all the regi
ments sickness is Increasing at an
alarming rate, and matters promise to
grow worse instead of better. There
are received daily at the division hospi
tal an average of five more cases than
are discharged, and the place is already
so full that large tents have been put
up in the yards to accommodate the
overflow, and a brr.nch hospital for
convalescents, ; besides the Red Cross
Hospital, for officers,' has been estab
lished atMalate. The men suffer from
dysentery,, typhoid, diarrhea and a kind
of low malaria or dengue fever, from
which recovery is always slow. The
dysentery ' leaves the men, when it

go home they will never be thoroughly
well again. Typhoid is always danger

victims so that it seems impossible to
regain strength. " Only, from malaria is

COCK-FIGHTING ENDED IN
THE PHILIPPINE CAPITAL
Pits in Whicf) Feathered Gladiators Contested Â¥\ove
Been Transformed Ir)to Barracks for the
Soldiers.
MANILA, Oct. 21.â Lieutenant James H. Jordan of the First California, public architect, has virtually
been the means of putting an end to cock-fighting as a public pastime in Manila. There are â or were
when the town was under Spanish ruleâ three immense buildings of the kind called Nipa, in the city
used solely for this sport. There was no Tagallo so poor he did not own at least one fighting cock
and the bloods of the city had anywhere from one to a dozen. There we're strains of fighting cocks,
and families had their favorite strains, as some old English sporting families have their lines of racers
and hunters, tracing back to the Arabs.
But there will be no more cock-fights in Manila, at least in public. The American soldier must have
shelter and Lieutenant Jordan as public architect recommended the adoption of the pits for barrack pur
poses. The places are roomy, well ventilated and adapted for the purpose. Bids were accordingly invited
and then it was discovered that the Chinese, who control the lumber trade and the hardware business, were
up to all the tricks of which American contractors claim to have a monopoly. In effect, the Chinese com
bined to "do" the United States Government. Lieutenant Jordan saw the scheme and blocked it by fixing
an upset price. For this price, $10,000, the cockpit shown herewith, at Paco, has been floored and fitted for
the occupancy of troops, and for the like sum the two remaining pits at Sampoloc and on the Calle Iris
will be similarly refitted.
The whole scheme, besides being unpopular with the Tagalloa, was a great surprise to the Thirteenth
Minnesota Regiment, most of the members of which had game cocks which they fought in the pits, and par
ticularly to one Captain McWade of that company, whose bird was a winner. Captain McWade knows more
about fighting cocks than he does about fighting men. If he had not he would not have laid down in a paddy
field with forty-six of his company while the fate of Manila was being determined.
third attack, which may prove fatal.
Add smallpox and the likelihood of bu
bonic plague and cholera to this cate
gory and the outlook is not cheering.
The Californians have at last estab
lished a hospital of their own
in the suburbs of Ermita, almost on
the seashore and fronting on the Calle
Real. It is a roomy place and the sick
boys, who were moved there to-day, are
delighted with it. The place is cool and
airy and the sea breeze blows in upon
the beds of the carrying heal
ing in its breath. The Californians,
even against the adverse conditions of
garrison life, are carrying their record
as the healthiest regiment in the army.
I give you herewith a list of the sick
in the regiment. Compare it with old

Those cases of organic trouble shown i
here are among the recruits for the
most part. The old men of the regi
ment suffer from chronic ills and from
the results of hardships endured in the
capture of Manila. It remained for the
medical gentlemen examining recruits
at San Francisco to send into the trop
ics men so diseased they would not
keep health possibly even in so tem
perate an atmosphere as that of Cali
fornia for very long. Little, however,
ran be expected when a man is passed
fit for a soldier's duty who has hem
orrhage of the lungs on the secorid day
after he landed at Manila. That is
what happened to one of the recruits
for D Company. This man did one
day's guard duty and has been on sick
call ever since. Among those who came
down on the Pennsylvania were several
men who were rejected on the first
medical examination.
By the way, I do not send the names
of the sick because so long as a mother
does not really know her boy is ill she
will have the satisfaction of hoping he
is not.
The boys are bearing up well. No
set could do better in the field or in
garrison. Reflect that this is the
healthiest regiment in the command
and you can picture to yourself what
the others are. The men who are in
the hospital are as nothing to the sick
in quarters â the men too ill to work
and not ill enough to go to bed.
The Callfornlans at last given the
care they should have had all along
and would have had if their own offi
cers had been given the care of them,
are the most fortunate regiment. The
Minnesotas, poor boys, are the most
unfortunate. Whatever they did on
the day Manila fell, they are doing
noble work now. They police the city
by night and by day, going into all the
dens and death traps, into all the filthy
holes and dirty corners, exposed con
stantly to a thousand unknown dangers
and nameless infections, and they do I
their work well and faithfully. The
atonement has been made, is being
made dally in the sick list and the
death rate of the Thirteenth Minnesota. 111 1

TWO GUILTY,

INNOCENT
Nevills Extortion Case
Ends.
A NEW TRIAL IS DEMANDED
MOTION WILL BE ARGUED NEXT
SATURDAY.
Story of the Relations Between Com
plainant and Defendant That
Led Up to the Arrest of
the Extortionists.
For their crime of demanding "hush
money" from Captain W. E. Nevills, Mrs.
Elsie Williams and Myron Azhderian
must go to the penitentiary. Such is the
verdict of the jury after a deliberation of
almost eighteen hours. Mrs. Grace Loose,
a sister of the convicted extortionist, was
declared innocent of the charge against
her and by order of court she was dis
charged, while Mrs. Williams was recom
mended to the court's mercy. When the
verdict was announced surprise rather
than grief was manifest on Mrs. Wil
liams' face, while Azhderian remained
mute and sullen. Mrs. Loose did not ap
pear happy over the fact of her acquittal.
She busied herself comforting her sister,
and perhaps her heart was too bitter for
happiness to find place there when she
recalled to mind the story of her sister's
downfall and how circumstances, if not
desire, had led her to a felon's cell.
The story is a simple one. Nevills met '
Mrs. Williams when she was making an
honest living- toiling over the keyboard
of a typewriter. She was young and j
handsome and Nevills soon took her from
her busy life and installed her in a cot
tage, where he was a frequent visitor.
She had clothes and money given her
and, if her story given on the stand is
true, her conscience was fortified against
the sinful life she was leading by a prom
ise made by Nevills that he would marry
her.
Finally she went to live on Nevills'
Fresno vineyard and h^re her troubles
commenced. She formed the acquaint
ance of Azhderian, and after Nevills had
decided to break off the relations that
had long existed between Mrs. Williams
and himself, Azhderian became a willing
ally, in fact the leader, in a conspiracy to
"bleed" the aged capitalist.
After a time they succeeded in getting
$2000 out of Nevills, but they wanted
more. Nevills refused to comply with
their demands. They, were obdurate and
with certain alleged incriminating letters
forced Nevills into a corner. His patience !
became exhausted and with no thonght
of the inevitable expose he had his perse
cutors arrested.
The trinl was long and bitter. Special
counsel were employed and every point
for and against the accused was taken
advantage of. Friday night the case was
submitted to the jury. The hours passed
and as it could not reach an agreement
was ordered locked up for the night. Yes
terday morning It handed in its verdict
and after it had been read Judge Cook
announced that he would pass sentence
Saturday, December 3. On that date a
motion for a new trial will be argued and
in event it Is granted the prisoners will
be released on bail; if not, sentence will
be passed and they will go to prison to
await the action of the Supreme Court or
serve their sentence, as they see fit.

NO NEED OF AN

Congress Can Complete
Its Work on Time.
ARRANGING APPROPRIATIONS
SUB-COMMITTEES CONSIDERING
EXTRAORDINARY EXPENSES.
Representative Cannon Thinks It Is
Useless to Attempt to Labor
During the Holiday
Recess.
Special IMspatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 26.âRepresen
tative Cannon of Illinois, chairman of
the Appropriations Committee of the
House, has arrived, and to-day the
Sub-Committee on Deficiencies began
the consideration of the estimates for
the extraordinary expenses of the army
and navy growing out of the war, also
the preparation of a bill covering these
deficiencies from the period from Janu
ary 1. 1899, to July 1, 1899. Mr. Cannon
will push the preparation and consid
eration of the regular appropriation
bills as rapidly as possible, but he sees
no reason now why any of them should
fail and thus necessitate an extra ses
sion.
He expects that the urgent deficiency
and the District of Columbia bills will
pass before the holidays and that work
on the other regular bills will have pro
pressed so far during the recess that
they can be brought into the House
after the recess as rapidly as that body
is ready for them. The committees
having- jurisdiction over the bills not
prepared by the Appropriations Com
mittee, agriculture, consular and diplo
matic, army and navy, etc., will also
get to work immediately after the Bes
sion begins.
Mr. Cannon thinks it is useless to at
tempt to work during the holiday re
cess. There have been two occasions
during the last twenty years when the
House has refused to adjourn for the
customary recess, but on each it was
impossible to keep a quorum of mem
bers in town, and little was accom
plished.
Both he and Mr. Dingley, chairman
of the Ways and Means Committee,
share the opinion that to try to hold
the House here during the recess would
be impracticable and unprofitable. With
the enactment of the regular money
bills necessary to carry on the govern
mental machinery at this session of
Congress Mr. Cannon sees no occasion
for an extra session, bo far as legisla
tion for our new possessions is con
cerned. He believes unripe or hasty
legislation for the government of the
islands would be infinitely worse than
military rule. Under military gov
ernorship there is perfect elasticity.
Changes can be made to fit new condi-"
tions as fast as they may arise.
A year's delay before attempting
permanent legislation would give ample
time for the study of all the conditions
surroundlr- the government of the
islands, both by the military authori
ties and commissions which miKht be
provided by Congress. Congress could
then, Mr. Cannon says, deal intelli
gently with the subject.
The grand total of the- appropriations
for the fiscal y^ar ending July 1, 1898,
including the deficiencies for extraor
dinary expenses from January 1 to July
1, 1899, is $893,231,615. There are no fig
ures as yet upon which the appropria
tions for the coming session of Con
fess can be base*? but Mr. Cannon
says they will be considerably below
the figures of the last Congress.
WILLIAM RETURNS
FROM HOLY LAND
All the Prussian Ministers Welcome
the Emperor and Empress of
Germany.
POTSDAM, Nov. 26.â The Emperor
and Empress of Germany arrived here
at 11 o'clock this morning on their return
from the H6ly Land.
All the Prussian Ministers welcomed the
Emperor and Empress of Germany on
their arrival here. The imperial Chancel
lor, Prince Hohenlohe, expressed the sin
cere pleasure experienced by the Minis
ters at the safe return- of their Majesties.
Later the Emperor detailed to the Min
isters the results thus far obtained by his
journey and the results expected, with
which he expressed himself as being sat
isfied. The Emperor also gave the Min
isters his views of the present political
situation In the Mediterranean.
BERLIN, Nov. 26.â The church bell*
were rung and the public buildings were
decorated with flags when Emperor Wil
liam passed through here to-day. The
Boersen Zeitung says his Majesty's trip
to the Holy Land has cost 10.000,000 marks.
A few of the newspapers print welcoming
articles.
Conflagration at Fresno.
FRESNO, Nov. 26.â Fire broke out last

firemen had, therefore, great difficulty in
extinguishing it. The loss to the owners
of the building and the tenants will

"WHISKY MEDICINES."
THE VOICE,
The Leading Temperance Paper*
Sounds the Call to a New Cru-
sade in the Following: Article.
"ANOTHER HEAD ON THE HYDRA."
"It Is time attention was drawn to a
form of alcoholic traffic that seems to
have been overlooked by those engaged
in the crusade against the rum power.
If, as is believed and taught, alcohol is
most dangerous when it fights in am-
bush, if it is most to be dreaded when it
finds its first entrance to the system in
the pleasant sauces and dishes of the
home, then the form of alcoholic traffic
in question is doubly dangerous, for it
comes in the guise of medicine and at-
tacks a system prepared by weakness to
easily surrender to the assault. In many
PATENT MEDICINES
which are largely consumed throughout
the country by all classes of people
there is a percentage of alcohol which
puÂ« them on a level with beer, rum
and whisky as intoxicants. It is the
smallness only of the dose prescribed
which prevents a prompt recognition of
the intoxicating effects of these so-
called medicines by those who use
them.
"It is safe to affirm that they are
MEDICINES IN NAME ONLY.
Their chief value lies in their alcoholic
effect as a stimulant. In fact, those who
know attribute the benefits ascribed to
this class of medicines wholly to the
stimulative effect of the alcohol they
contain. They are used largely by
persons not In the habit of drinking
liquors, and the little dose taken three
or four times a day is as stimulating
to these people as his regular 'finger'
of 'bitters' is to the regular liquor-
drinker.
WHAT CAN BE DONE?
"What ought to be done at least is to
compel every patent-medicine manu-
facturer to put on the wrapper of his
bottle the quantity of alcohol it con-
tains. That would at least leave peo-
ple to exercise their own judgments.
More than that, no paper truly interest-
ed in temperance reform should print
the advertisement of any alcoholic
medicine. It should be the duty of
every temperance organization and
branch in the country to look into this
question, agitate it and deal with the
facts just as earnestly and as honestly
as other facts have been dealt with."
Appreciating the gravity of the issue
raised by the strong statement of facts
made in the foregoing article, we wish
to call general attention to the fact that
Dr. Pierces Golden Medical Discovery
and Dr. Pierces Favorite Prescription
contain
NO ALCOHOL, NO WHISKY, NO IN-
TOXICANT OF ANY KIND.
These medicines are equally free from
opium and other narcotics.
They are in the strictest meaning of
the words, temperance medicines. Of no
other medicine, put up especially for
woman's use, can it be truthfully af-
firmed as of Dr. Pierces Favorite Pre-
scription, that it contains neither alco-
hol nor opium or other narcotic in any
form.
While the negative features of Dr.
Pierces medicines may only interest
some of the readers of this article, the
positive features of these medicines
must be of interest to every one. The
great value of "Golden Medical Dis-
covery" in the cure of diseased or de-
ranged conditions of the stomach and
digestive and nutritive organs is testi-
fied to by tens of thousands who have
found health and healing in this great
remedy. The "Discovery" Increases the
action of the blood-making glands, and
by curing the diseases which corrupt
and cripple the stomach and digestive
and nutritive organs, it enables a full
and pure supply of blood to be sent to
every part of the body.
WOMEN KNOW ITS WORTH.
Women who are always appreciative
of benefits have been especially appre-
ciative of the benefits following the use
of Dr. Pierces Favorite Prescription.
Its wonderful cures of irregularities,
inflammations, ulcerations and female
troubles have caused women to name
it, "that God-send to women." It is en-
titled to wear the "blue ribbon" of
merit as well as the blue ribbon of tem-
perance.
THE BIBLE OF THE BODY.
Perhaps no greater gift was ever of-
fered than the People's Common Sense
Medical Adviser. It contains 1008
pages and has over 700 illustrations,
j and is the life work of its author, Dr.
j R. V. Pierce, chief consulting physician
I to the Invalids' Hotel and Surgical In-
stitute, Buffalo, N. Y. This book has
been well called "The Bible of the
Body." It is to the body what the Bi-
ble is to the soul, "a lamp unto the feet
and a light unto the path." It deals
with the great questions of physical
life so simply that all may understand
and so purely that it is essentially the
I one medical work for the home library.

NEW YORK, Nov. 26.â The first se
vere snowstorm of the winter struck
New York and vicinity early this after
noon and increased in violence until
to-night, when it assumed almost the
proportions of a blizzard. Forty miles
an hour is the rate the wind blew
through the city and on Long Island
.:o;Lst it reached a velocity or' sixty
s an hour. At about 11 o'clock
to-night the snow had fallen to a depth
ireral inches, and in some places
hid drilled as high as live feet. The
temperature had gradually fallen un
til at midnight it was 26 degi
All of the trolley cars running to the
suburbs have been forced to discon
tinue service and the surface lines in
Manhattan and Brooklyn boroughs
have fared almost as badly, being
forced to abandon then- schedules.
All of the horse car lines are block
ed. The elevated roads ha\ c discon
tinued their regular schedule and are
nning to have trouble. The rail
road lines out oi the city have not yy t-tt -t
been forced to abandon their regular
schedules, but the prospect is that they
will have to do so before morning.
The only vessels to leave New York
City were seven steamers, and only one
of these, a freighter, was for Europe.
The rest were all bound to Southern
ports on the coast and the West Indies.
Th>- only Atlantic passenger liners to
their wharves were the Cunarder
Lucania and the Atlantic transport
steamer Manitou, both of which
dropped anchor off Staten Island,
where they remain. After the storm set
in at noon only three steamers arrived
In port, two from the West Indies and
an old Dominion line boat from Nor
folk. The British freight steamer
Leitrim, from London, was sighted
passing Fire Island shortly after 2
o'clock this afternoon, bound here, but
â was not reported again. A number of
schooners ran in past Sandy Hook
during the afternoon for refuge in the i
lower bay. A number of steamers are |
due, among them being the French
liner La Touraine. No word can be
obtained from Sandy Hook to-night as
to what may be seen In the offline, if
anything, as shortly after 7 o'clock to
night the wires went down and cut off
communication.
BOSTON, Nov. 26.â T'nless the north
east snowstorm, which began in this
city last night and which is general
throughout the State and Southern
New England, subsides before morning,
it seems it will be a record-breaker for
November. Near the coast the temper
ature is just above freezing. The snow
is damp and sticky, but in the interior
the flakes are finer and the snow is
drifting badly.
PHILADELPHIA. Nov. 26.â Over six
inches of snow fell here during the past
twelve hours. up to midnight to-night,
â¢ at which time the storm showed signs
of abatement. Reports from the in
terior of the State are to the effect that
snow fell heavily in all sections.
LEXINGTON, Ky., Nov. 26.â The
thermometer has been dropping here
. since 3 o'clock this morning and prom
. ises to go to zero to-night. The worst
blizzard known in years raged here this
morning. It is almost unprecedented
weather for this time of the year.

THE SIMPLEST CURE FOR
INDIGESTION,
As Well as the Safest and Cheapest.
The new medical discovery, Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets, digest the food in-
stead of making the worn-out stomach
do all the work, give it. a much needed
rest, and a cure of dyspepsia is the
natural result.
You get nourishment and rest at the
same time because these tablets will
' thoroughly digest all wholesome food
â¢ taken into the stomach whether the
Btomach works or not. A cure .is cer-
tain to result because the digestive
organs are given a chance to rest and
recover their natural vigor and tone.
The Tablets are. then no longer re-
quired.
To show the manner in which the
remedy acts on different people and

IMPROVEMENT OF
OUR WATERWAYS
Public Works Board's
Excellent Record.
PRAISED BY EXCURSIONISTS
SACRAMENTOANS VISIT NEW
TOWN SHOALS.
Loud in Praise of the Extent of the
Work Accomplished, as Well
as Its Substantial
Quality.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Nov. 26.â About 150
well known State and County officials
and merchants, residents of Sacramen
to and adjacent counties, attended the
excursion to-day to the Elk Horn
easement and the jetties at the New
Town shoals, given by Commissioner j
of Public Works K. E. Leake and his J
auditing board. The excursion afforded
the first opportunity to a representa
tive section .of the public to see what
the present commission has accom
plished during the two years it has
been In office, and on every hand ex
pressions of surprise at the extent of <
the wurk and commendation for its
substantial quality were heard.
Among the passengers were Con
gressman Marion de Vries and Major
M. H. Heuer, the Government engineer,
who has charge of the work on the
navigable rivers of California and who
for some months has been serving as
consulting engineer to the commis
sion.
Major Heuer spoke in most compli
mentary terms of the work accom
plished by the commission, declaring
that in all his experience he had never
known of a commission which had
effected so much at such a small outlay
of money. The commission was author
ized by the last Legislature to expend
$300,000, but while it has constantly
been at work and while various points
on the Sacramento and San Joaquin
rivers show a vast improvement
through its endeavors, the total ex
pense to date has been but $78,872 47.
Fifteen or twenty years ago the sec
tion of Yolo County along the the river,
and lying in a northwesterly direction
from Sacramento, was populated by
prosperous farmers and orchardists,
whose vacant and dilapidated homes
and granaries, seen now from the decks
of the river boats, testify to the ruin
which the annual floods have wrought.
One of the most vulnerable portions of
the levee was located near Elk Horn,
and the breaks were so frequent there
that for nearly 3000 feet the old levee
was completely washed away, the
water even at its lowest stage refusing
to stay in its channel, the river dividing
its now between the channel and the
basin into which the crevasse opened.
It was here that the commission de
cided to make its tirst large experiment.
The result is to be found in a magnifi
cent piece of engineering skill in the
shape of an easement 2000 feet long,
covered by a rounded concrete surface
some 15 feet in width. This concrete
rests upon a foundation many feet
deep, of rock and earth, solidly packed,
and is flanked the entire length by a
system of piles and riprap work. Front-
Ing this again is an earth embankment
rising ten or twelve feet from the river
level and removing the easement eighty
or a hundred feet from the water.
The purpose of this stupendous piece
of work is to confine the river within
its banks during stages of low water,
and also during stages of high water,
until an excessive height Is reached,
when the water will flow over it into
the Yolo Basin, thus taking the strain
off the general -levee system. Eventu
ally, it is believed, the effect will be the
complete restoration of the valuable
lands which the annually recurring
floods pouring through the open levees
have ruined.
The jetty system at the New Town
shoals was also inspected. The work
here is of a character to remove the
shoals which for over forty years have
obstructed the entrance to the river
from salt water. The natural width of
the river at that point is 3000 feet, but
the jetties constructed by the commis
sion narrow the channel to 1200 feet,
thus adding to the velocity of the
stream and augmenting its power to re
move the shoals. In some places,
since the work has been put in, the
shoals have cleared for a depth of six
feet, although this cleansing has thus
far not been uniform.
Knerineer M. A. Nurpc, who has
charge of the work for the commission,
snid to The Call correspondent that the
next high-water season would demon
strate the utility of the work per
formed hy the commission, and he w r as
confident tho commission would be jus
tified in its course by the action of the
high water.
All the plans upon which the work
has been done were first submitted to
the 3ecretary of War, passed on by
him and th^ Government Board of En
gineers and returned with their ap
proval.
NAMES A COMMITTEE
ON LEGISLATION
| State Library Association Completes
Its Labors at the
Capital.
SACRAMENTO, Nov. 26.â The librari
ans, who have been in session in this city
i since yesterday morning, have completed
their labors and gone home. As a result
of the conference a committee on legis
lation, composed of F. J. Teggart and
George L. Clark, was appointed. This
committee will prepare a bill to be sub
mitted to the next Lepislffcture, the effect
of which will be, if passed, to allow any
one in the State, who is willing to pay the
mail, freight or express charges, to ob
tain books from the State Library.
Another committee was appointed, con
sisting of F. J. Teggart, Robert E. Cowan
and J. C. Rowel 1, whose work it will bo
to prepare a biblioÃraph of all the litera
ture ever written about California. This
is claimed by the librarians to be a much
needed work and Committeeman Teggart
is an enthusiast on the subject.
A number of interesting papers were
read at the concluding session to-day.
One of these was by C. L. Weller of Ala
meda on the the desirability of allowing
the public free access to the shelves;
another by v j. Te^gart on the subject,
"Bibliographic Aids." and a third, writ
ten by Miss U. M. Rurs of Pasadena on
"The Children in the Library."
Those in attendance on the conference
here feel that one of the effects of the
meeting will be a Concerted effort on the
part of the librarians of the State that
will lead to the people of California get
ting a larger use of the wealth of
books locked up in the Capitol.

Sensational Letter to
Investigators.
PROTECTION OF THE TROOPS
DEMANDED BY THE SECRETARY
OF THE SOCIETY.
It Is Alleged That the Boys in Blue
Have Been Starved, Maltreated,
and Some Even Murdered
While Sick.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Nov. 26.â At the meet
ing of the War Investigation Commis
sion to-day Captain Howell read a let
ter addressed to the commission by
Robert J. Roosevelt, secretary of the
committee of the Society for the Pro
tection of Soldiers.
General Dodge suggested that the
letter be received and filed, and by gen
eral consent General Dodge's sugges
tion was adopted. The letter written to
the commission by Mr. Roosevelt read
in part as follows:
To the Presidential Commission of In
quiry: I have noticed in the morning press
that one of your members criticizes the
witnesses who have testiiied at the re
quest of the committee formed in this city
to protect soldiers. They do not fix the
responsibility nor show who is to blame.
There seems to be a misunderstanding be
tween us. We supposed that all the wit
nesses had to do was to prove the facts
and chat the commission would .fix the
responsibility. .
The h( roic boys may forget their suffer
ings, may even refuse to testify to them;
but their mothers will not and their
fathers will not. Nor will It do to take
refuge behind the errors of the Civil War.
There was no intentional cruelty, such as
seems to have so often prevailed in this
war. The sick men were not starved.
The uncomplaining endurance of our
men has simply been heroic. They bore
wounds, sickness, privations, to death,
even, without a word. It was only neglect,
starvation, in fact, and abuse in the hos
pitals which called for the letters, and
RESULT OF REA'S RULE.
Salaries of San Jose High School Teachers Reduced
One-Half.
SAN JOSE, Nov. 26.â The Board of Ed
ucation met this evening, abolished all the
kindergartens, dismissed five special
teachers and reduced all salaries of teach
ers in high school one-half and all gram
mar teachers 10 per cent. This action
was taken on account of lack of money in
the school fund.
then only home to their familiesâ letters
which were sent to me by broken-hearted
mothers in pitiful appeals to try and help
their sons. I wish your commission could
have read them, but as many of them
were transmitted to me confidentially I
cannot even quote from them.
The witnesses have established mon
strous incapacity. That they have not full
confidence in the power of your commis
sion, no matter how good its will, to meet,
all the requirements the public demands
of it, is only echoing your own doubts;
but in spite of that they seem to have
done their share, and it would seem that
It only remains for you to do your best,
even "if that best is not quite satisfac
tory to yourselves. If done In good faith
it will teach the soldiers that at least
there is a power which was honestly
endeavoring to do them justice.
You can direct your inquiries in the first
place to the food supply. Find out who
gets the difftience between the double
rations allowed by the Government and
the meager hardtack, bacon and green
coffee served to the soldiers. The wit
nesses are the books and the rolls in the
public departments, to which you have
full access-.
We have furnished you the facts, shown
you the brutality, cruelty, neglect, indif
ference: how men whom the Government
was under every obligation to protect, and
especially because they had a right to rely
upon surh protection, were starved even
in the land of plenty; were uncared for
when sick; left without attention; when
wounded were abused, maltreated; in
some cases practically murdered. We
have shown you an indifference and belit
tling of human sufferings which continue
even now. If this nation is to become a
warlike one, if we are to have an array
which shall be efficient and to be relied
upon, these crimes and blunders must be
corrected; and your commission must cor
rect them. It is not for you to make the
feeble excuse that your commission, a
mere voluntary association, with no legal
existence even,,shall shouMer this respon
sibility.
The afternoon session completed the
work of the commission in this city.
The members went to Boston to-night.

STANFORD BADLY
BEATEN AT RENO
Nevada 'Varsity Team's
Triumph.
SHUTS OUT THE CARDINAL
SCORE THE SAME AS IN THE
THANKSGIVING GAME,
At No Stage of the Contest Had the
Palo Alto Lads the Better
of the Brawny Moun
taineers.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
RENO, Nev., Nov. 26.â The Nevada
University football team administered
a crushing defeat to the Stanford team
to-day, the score being the same as in
the Berkeley-Stanford game on
Thanksgiving dayâ 22 to 0.
The Stanford team arrived this morn
ing at 8 o'clock. It was met at the de
pot by a committee from the Nevada
University, which received them with
the Nevada 'varsity yell. The boys
alighted from the train apparently in
fine form, but after standing on the
platform 10 or IF minutes in a Nevada
November morning waiting for car
riages they got humps in their backs
and were heard to remark, "Lord, but
it's cold." The chill ozone sharpened
their appetites for the hot breakfast to
which they were treated by the Nevad
ans.
The two teams lined up at 2 o'clock.
Nevada won the toss and chose the
west goal. Stanford kicked to Brule,
who made fifteen yards. By a series of
end runs and center bucks Nevada car
ried the ball down the field and in
twenty minutes Hayes went over Stan
ford's line for the first touchdown.
Keddie failed to kick the sroal. Score-
Nevada 5, Stanford 0.
Stanford again kicked to Brule, who
ran in twenty-five yards. By a series
of counter rushes and repeated end
runs, and after a crowning run of fifty
yards by Moorman, Hayes scored the
second touchdown. Keddie kicked the
goal. Score: Nevada 11, Stanford 0.
Stanford kicked to Brule a third time.
The ball was forced to Stanford's rive-
yard line, where time was called for the
first half. Score: Nevada 11, Stan
ford 0.
Second half â Nevada kicked off and
Stanford ran in forty yards, and after
a series of center rushes forced the ball
to Nevada's fifteen-yard line. Stan
ford lost the ball on downs. Keddie
made a twenty-five yard run on the left.
Leavitt made a bad fumble and the ball
went to Stanford. At this point Stan
ford lost the ball on downs and Nevada,
by a series of rushes and bucks, carried
the ball to Stanford's three-yard line,
from which Chism scored the third
touchdown. Keddie failed to kick the
goal. Score: Nevada 16, Stanford 0.
Stanford kicked to Moorman, who
ran in twenty yardb and lost the ball
on a fumble. After Stanford lost on
downs, another fumble by Nevada and
a fumble by Stanford, without material
gains, Nevada by rushes carried the
ball to Stanford's goal, where Evans
made the fourth touchdown. Keddie
kicked the goal. Score 22 to 0.
During the remainder of the game
Nevada kept the ball almost entirely
in Stanford's territory. The game end
ed with the ball on Stanford's twenty
flve-yard line and the score at the close
stood: Nevada 22, Stanford 0.

GRANT GILLETT'S
TANGLED AFFAIRS
Young Cattle Speculator
Kept No Books.
NO RECORD OF BIG DEALS
NUMEROUS CREDITORS SCRAM
BLE TO LOCATE STOCK.
It Is Said the Daring Operator Mort
gaged Cattle Twice, and Is Now
in Hiding to Avoid
Arrest.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
KANSAS CITY, Nov. 26"â The where
abouts of Grant C. Gillett, the big
Kansas cattle-feeder, whose failure
was announced yesterday, are still
unknown. Probably twenty-five dif
ferent Kansas City live stock commis
sion houses are indorsers of Gillett's
paper, which is said to be scattered
through the banks of the country from
Denver to New York city. All of the
local firms declare that the paper they
hold is amply secured and that there
cannot possibly be any loss to a single
holder. Of the cattle in the feed lots,
something over 10,000 head were pur
chased from one Denver firm, that of
Dake & Keeler, to whom Gillett ia said
to have given a mortgage of $208,000.
These cattle are 3-year-old steers, and
cattlemen assert that a low estimate of
their present value is $30 a head, or
about $10 a head more than the interest
in the cattle held by the Denver .firm
Another lot of cattle contains 6500 head
which Gillett and another dealer own in
Oklahoma. These cattle are said to be
mortgaged for $125,000 and are stated to
be worth a third more than the amount
against them.
A remarkable thing about Gillett s
methods of doing business was that he
kept no books and took no one into his
confidence. All the details of his enor
mous deals were carried in his head,
and this complicates the matter. Gil
lett is dubbed as a careless financier,
and those who know him best now say
that sheer luck carried him through
many of his heaviest deals. Many local
stockmen declare that he would not
run away even if he knew his debts
would wipe out his herds and ranches,
because he believes that luck will al
ways attend him. Nevertheless, there
was talk to-day that he had mort
gaged cattle twice and left to avoid ar
rest.
The deal that forced Gillett to the
wall was a $12f>,000 loan held by a
Kansas City livestock firm. The money
was advanced to him on 6500 head of
feeding cattle in Oklahoma, and the
mortgage fell due last week. The Kan
sas City firm declined to extend the
loan.
Gillet tried hard to secure money,
but for the. first time in his ca
reer he was unable to get backing.
Close upon the heels of this came a
deal that he had with Valle & Gates,
the Arizona cattle magnates. Gillett
had paid $10,000 as earnest money on
4000 cattle in the Panhandle of Texas,
which Vaile & Gates owned on the
famous "J. A." ranch. These cattle
were worth $120,000, and Gillett was
unable to raise the money to take them,
and saw his $10,000 go to pay his liabil
ity for the loss to Vaile & Gates. As
soon as it was learned here that Gil
lett was being pressed by one or two
of his creditors, others sent their rep
resentatives to his ranch to protect
their loans. Meanwhile the plunger
took his leave.
Eastern holders of Gillett's paper,
I which has passed through the
hands of the Kansas City firms, began
telegraphing, and to-day a few of the
Kansas City houses are trying to sell
livestock paper.
KANSAS CITY, Nov. 26.â A special
to the Journal from Abilene, Kans..
states that the liabilities of Grant Gil
lett, the cattle kiner. will reach nearly
a million and a half dollars, and that
the assets ma 1 - not reach more than
half this amount. It develops that Gil
lett had filed in Dickinson County
mortgages covering 30.993 head of cat
tle and aggregating $849,740.
In addition to this amount, according
to the Journal's despatch Gillett has
outstanding nearly $600,000 of accommo
dation paper. The thirty or more men
who are in Abilene representing com
mission houses and other creditors of
Gillett have been busy all day tracing
the cattle upon which their firms hold
mortene'es. It was found that at least
one bunch of cattle has been mortgaged
to two firms. The affairs are in a bad
tangle, which will require weeks to un
ravel, and it is feared that much litiga
tion will result. The whereabouts of
Gillett is still unknown.
The mortgages filed in Abilene show
the principal creditors and their securi
ties to be as follows: Elmore & Cooper
of Kansas City. 8170 head, $243,000; Gil
lespie Commission Company, Kansas
City, 7000 head, $210,000; Trowers &
Sons, Kansas City, 4600 head, $160,000;
Vaile & Gates, Kansas City, 542 head,
' $16,200; Holmes Live Stock Company,
Kansas City. 1560 head. $41,800; Evans-
Snyder-Buell Company, Kansas City,
6220 head. $122,900; Bohnrt & Co., St.
Joseph, Mo., 1500 head, $30,000; Keeler
& Dake, Denver, 1264 head, $25,000;
total, 30,993 head, $849,740.

BERLIN, Nov. 26.â Frank
Knaak of New York has been ar
rested on the charge of lese ma-
Jeste, said to have been com
mitted In a wine shop. Mr.
Knaak was arrested while sit
ting with his wife in a fashion
able restaurant. It is alleged
that he referred in an offensive
manner to the Emperor, and a
person who heard him immedi
ately summoned a policeman.
Although Mr. Knaak had sev
eral witnesses who denied that
he had made the alleged remark,
he was thrown into jail.
The officials of the United
States Embassy have done
everything possible to bring
about his release and a large
amount of bail has been offered.
J. B. Jackson, the first Charge

GOVERNOR-ELECT CAGE'S
EXECUTIVE SECRETARY
IV. ff. DAVIS OF LOS fI.KCEI.ES SAID TO BE THE MAN.
HERE has been and Is at present a gTeat deal of curiosity as to who
rI 1 will receive the appointment of executive secretary to Governor
\ Gage.
JL The Call is informed on very reliable authority that this honor will
be conferred upon W. H. Davis, the well-known attorney of Los Angeles.
Mr. Davis is the son of E. A. Davis, Superior Judge of Tuba and Sutter
counties, and one of the active party workers in the southern section of the
State.
It was impossible to confirm the news last night, owing to the pres
ence of Governor-elect Gage at the battle-ship banquet, and Mr. Davis
could not be found; but owing to his intimate social and professional rela
tions to Mr. Gage, the statement that he has been selected may be taken
as authentic.
During the recent Republican convention Mr. Davis took a very prom
inent part In the nomination of Mr. Gage.
THREE OF SEGNA'S
SLAYERS CAPTURED
Mexican Murderers in

Special Dispatch to The Call.
PHOENIX, Ariz., Nov. 26.â The in
formation reaches here that three out
of five Mexicans who murdered William
Segna at Weaver, Yavapai County,
last Sunday night, have been arrested
and will have their preliminary trial on
Monday at Congress.
The crime was cmc of the most cold
blooded recorded in this Territory. The
Mexicans effected an entrance to Seg
na's place of business, and, shutting
the doors, proceeded to stab their vic
tim to death. His outcries attracted a
number of people to the scene, who at
tempted to force an entrance. The
murderers stopped their bloody work
long enough to have two of their num
ber slip to the door and notify the by
standers that they would be killed if
they did not go away. After the mur
der they were seen to leave the prem
ises.
The murderers secreted themselves in
the community and began a course of
intimidation against those who were
disposed to inform the authorities of
their whereabouts. Sheriff Ruffner and
deputies effected the capture of the
men by walking in upon them at tb.3
house at which they were stopping.

ROBBERS MURDER
"GRANDMA" WYNN
Left Dead by Ransack
ers of Her House.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ST. LOUIS, Nov. 26.â Aged "Gramd
ma" Wynn, the richest resident of
Brooklyn, 111., and owner of half the
town, which lies across the river from
here, was murdered Friday night or
early Saturday morning by robbers,
who cut her throat and left her dead
in the front yard, after ransacking the
house.
Mrs. Wynn, who frequently had con
siderable money in the house, lived en
tirely alone. She was a kindly old lady,
with many virtues. Her only failing
was a desire to live by herself. She
managed her own estate personally,
collected her rents, banked her money
and invested her savings without con
sulting any one. Mrs. Wynn was esti
mated to be worth from $90,000 to $100...
000.
The murderer or murderers left no
clue. It is not known how much money
they obtained, but the amount must
have been considerable. Mrs. Wynn'g
relatives all live in St. Louis. They
asked her many times to leave Brook
lyn and put her property there in tha
hands of an agent, but she always
refused.
A negro man and woman living near
the scene of the murder have been
arrested on suspicion. They tell con
flicting stories about two tramps and
act suspiciously.

Out in the Cold.
A eeoret conference was held last even-
Ing- of Supervisors Devany, Haskins, j
Erltt, Sheehan and Delany, to determine j
what disposition should be made of the i
$150,000 surplus rash derived from the re- I
cent tax levy. It was not exactly a meet-
Ing of the Finance Committee, for the

Rottanzi, was absent. The caucus, how
ever, included the leading spirits of the
close combination in the board which dic
tates the policy In all Important matters.
As stated In yesterday's Call one Item
of proposed expense Is for the building
of a new police station on Seventeenth
street in the Mission district. The esti
mated cost is $60,000 and the Supervisors
In caucus favored the appropriation. It
was a mooted question with them wheth

THE SAN FEANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 27, 1893.
BIG FRAUDS IN FERRY
BUILDING CONTRACTS
Startling Revelations Made by the Expert
Employed by the Senate Investigating
Committee.
The State Was Robbed of Almost Sixty-Sewn Thousand
Dollars on Four Contracts Alone - How
the Immense Steal Was Ac
complished.
SUMS STOLEN FROM THE STATE.
_ â _ . i
Galvanized iron contract $14,789 94
Iron and steel contract 3,334 3O
masonry contract 28,042 62
Carpentering and Plaster
ing vuork 20,680 69
Total (investigations to date)s66,B4 7 55
A trifle less than $67,000 is the amount
named by the expert of the Senate In
vestigating Committee as the net loss
to the State on four of the contracts
in connection with the construction of
the new ferry building. In other words,
the State has been robbed of that
amount of money by persons not named
in the expert's report.
The Senate Committee having au
thority to investigate the affairs of all
State institutions undertook the work
of investigating the ferry depot frauds
about three months ago, soon after this
paper had concluded an exhaustive in
vestigation, by which it was proved be
yond a doubt that contractors and in
terested officials had robbed the State
of more than $100,000 in connection with
the construction of the ferry depot
building. The revelations made yester
day by the expert employed by the
committee bear out in eVP*4" detail the
truth of the startling disclosures made
by The Call some months ago, as well
as by a partial report made by the
present Grand Jury. Under the search
ing investigation now being conducted
there is promise that the guilty officials
will be brought to justice and the whole
shameful combination by which vast
sums generously provided by the tax
payers of the State for the erection of
a model depot building for the benefit
of the public have been fraudulently
appropriated by private individuals
will be exposed and broken up.
The Senate Committee met yesterday
afternoon in the rooms of the Harbor
Commissioners in the tery building for
the purpose of taking the testimony of
Expert James W. Reid, the well known
architect, of this city, who. with Archi
tect WB. * aville, has been engaged in
the work of investigating the ferry
building contracts under the -direction
of the members of the committee dur
ing the past three months. The mem
bers of the committee present were:
Â£pnltor J H Dickinson (chairman),
lenftor W F. Frisk and Senator
fohnJ Boyce. All of the members of
the Board of State Harbor Commis
sioners Architect Swain, Chief Engi
neer Holmes and many interested con-
Tractors were also In a" enda " Â£ itness
After being placed on the witness
stand Expert Reid stated that his in
the roofing and galvanized iron work,
iron and steel work, masonry work,
and the woodwork and plastering As
four," that the State was a hea V J, ' oS er
hv reason of excessive prices paid to
coVrlctors, and that the " opportu-
Tiltv for the payment of these
excessive prices was brought about by
a system of changes and substitutions
in the original plans under which the
original contracts had been let. *-"<-"
of the four contracts mentioned was
taken un in turn and the various
changes and substitutions made under
authority from the Harbor Commis
sioners and with the approval of Archi
tect Swain were discussed in detail.
Among the items in the contract for
iron and steel work Mr. Reid pointed
out the one having connection with the
i steel braces for the tower. The orig
! inal plans under which the contract
i was let placed these braces on the in
1 side of the structure. Supplemental
i plans were afterward made placing
the braces on the outside of the tower
Later on the plans were again changed
so as to place the braces where they
were originally. These changes cost
the State $1149, which sum represented
a net loss. A change in the style of
certain tie rods cost the State just
$1080 50, and in substituting iron for
steel in another item of construction
the State came out loser to the extent
of $400. In the matter of the steel work
for the large windows for the grand
nave the State was mulcted of the sum
of $600 and the substitution of wooden
for steel doors netted somebody an un
earned profit of $854, which sum, of
course, represents the net loss to the
State on this particular Item of con
struction. The expert's figures show
that on this one contract for the iron
and steel work the State suffered a to
tal loss of $3334 30.
It should be stated here, as the fact
was brought out in evidence, that
Chairman Colnon Is the only member
of the present Board of State Harbor
Commissioners who held office during
the period when the original contracts
were let and during the time when a
majority of the changes and substitu
tions, by means of which the State was
robbed, were authorized.
The next contract taken up by Ex
pert Reid was that for the masonry
work In the building. He was of the
opinion, he said, that the change from
Oregon stone to Colusa sandstone as
the material for the outside walls of the
building did not involve any loss to the
State. The substitution, of ; common
brick for enameled and Roman brick,
and other changes in like material had
resulted in the. State beiner robbed of
the sum of $5496 98. That is to say. the
contractor was paid that amount more
than he should rfave been paid over
and above a legitimate profit. In all
of these cases where * changes and sub-,
stitutions were made the amounts-paid
out were fixed by the Board of Harbor
Commissioners and approved ; by Archi
tect Swain.
The style of floor arches In the build
ing were changed from terra rotta to
expanded metal and this chancre In
volved a net , loss to the State; of : $10.
952 18. It should be understood that in
the case of this item, i as with ', all ) items,
,that . have - been -â  mentioned '% or ; will be
mentioned : as belne a : Dart of the I ex
pert's report, the sum named as the
amount of the net loss to the State rep
resents an illegitimate expenditure for
the work as performed. That is to say,
the State paid a legitimate price for
the work and then, as in the case of
the item just mentioned, paid an ad
ditional $10,952 18 to the interested par
ties.
The State suffered a net loss of
$1772 76 by the changes involved in the
omission of the finish of the mezzanine
floor, changes on the ground floor and
the substitution of wire laths for ceil
ing tiles. Changes in the thickness of
some of the walls involved a loss to the
State of $505, and changes in the speci
fications for certain marble work re
sulted in the public treasury being
robbed of the sum of $2162. Other mar
ble work specified by the expert wa.&
the cause of a net loss of $196, and
some additional masonry work put
$1199 65 unearned dollars into the pock
ets of those who were interested in the
thieving game. The item of extra ce
ment, the use of which was made
necessary by various changes in the
masonry contract, added $3167 S2 to the
bank roll of the conspirators, and the
State was robbed of $2000 in connection
with the construction of the mosaic
floor of the grand nave.
To make a long story short, the ille
gitimate profits in c nnection with the
masonry contract aggregate, accord
ing to the report of Expert Reid, no less
than $25,042 46.
In connection with the contract for
rofing and galvanized iron work, all of
the charges made by The Call were
fully substantiated b" the report of the
expert. In this contract light iron was
substituted for heavy iron, changes
were made in the manner of construc
tion, and items provided for in the
specifications were omitted. This, ac
cording to the report, resulted in a net
lopf to the State of $8244 31. Changes
in the plans for certain items of mold
ing involved a net loss of $302 40. The
contractor charged extra for covering
the west wall of the main waiting room
with galvanized iron, though it was in
cluded in his original contract. For
this he received $2978, all of which was
net profit to him and net loss to the
State.
On this contract, which originally
amounted to less than $20,000, the State
was mulcted of the total sum of $14,
789 94.
The last contract taken up by Expert
Reid was that for carpenter, plastering
and glazing work. He showed that by
the change of the material for the in
terior partitions from oak to Oregon
pine the State was juggled out of the
sum of $10,640 80. Item after Item was
taken up and in almost every instance
where changes were authorized by the
Harbor Commissioners the State was
swindled, the sums usually being pro
portionate to the amount of work done.
On the entire contract the net loss to
the State was stated as being $20,680 69.
The grand total of losse" on the four
con tracts investigated is given as $66,-
S4T 56.
The figures of the expert have to do
with the kind of material and work
actually furnished and do not take Into
account the great loss the State has
suffered by reason of the substitution
of poor and cheap material for the good
and expensive material originally con
tracted for. This is particularly true
of the substitution of Colusa sandstone
for Oregon gray stone. It is not con
tended that one is Inferior to the other,
and the expert in his investigations
was not authorized to go behind the
bids actually made to the Harbor Com
missioners; but it is, nevertheless true
that the Harbor Commissioners, by
their act In substituting one for the
othen, made it impossible for the State
to benefit by the disparity in the bids
for the balance of the material included
in the blanket contract. The effect of
the change was to make the contractor
a present of about $11,000. the difference
in the cost price to him of the two ma
terials.
Several important contracts have yet
to be investigated, and the work of the
Senate Committee will not be com
pleted for several weeks. Another ses
sion will be held on Monday morning,
at which contractors will be given an
opportunity to question Expert Reid on
the accuracy of his report.
TWO OLD MEN GONE TO REST.
One Dies in the Receiving Hospital
and the Other in the Ambulance.
Two old men died suddenly yesterday,
one while being removed from the City
Prison to the City and County Hospital,
and the other in the Receiving Hospital.
A. J. Owen, a veteran of the cival war
and an inmate of the Yountville Home,
fell at Turk and Jones streets Wednesday
afternoon and was taken to the hospital.
He was not much injured, but early yes
terday morning he was stricken with ap
oplexy and died in a few minutes.
John D. Ross, a wheelwright. 75 years
of age, was arrested on Kentucky street
Friday night by Policeman C. Murphy on
a charge of drunkenness. While Judge
lonian was in tho prison yesterday morn
ing discharging "drunks" the old man.
Who was a sufferer from asthma, was
seized with a fit and the ambulance was
summoned to take him tn the City and
County Hospital for treatment, but he
died on the way.

Bernard McArdle has sued the A. S.
Neal Warehouse Company and the Ca
hlll & Hall Elevator Company to re
cover damages In the sum of $50,000 for
personal injuries. On October 1, McArdle
alleges that while he was in defendants'
employ a defective valve on a boiler blew
out and he was severely scalded by the
escaping steam. Hence the suit.
SENATORS AND
ASSEMBLYMEN
COME TO TOWN
Legislative Quorum
Present.
COMMITTEE CHAIRMANSHIPS
FOUR CANDIDATES TO HEAD
WAYS AND MEANS.
Lieutenant Governor NefE Listens to
Hints About the Organization
of the Senate for the
Coming Session.
There -was a quorum of the next Legis
lature in San Francisco yesterday and
many of the newly elected Assemblymen
and several of the hold-over Senators as
sembled at the Palace Hotel just after the
Wisconsin was launched. The arrival of
Governor-elect Gage and the event at thp
Union Iron Works attracted the legisla
tors to the city.
Much of the gossip around the Palace
had reference to legislative affairs. The
United States Senatorship was discussed
and many opinions were expressed as to
the preference of individual members of
the Legislature.
Among the guests aboard the Harbor
Commissioners' boat, the Governor Mark
ham, were Senators Dickinson, Bujla.
Morehouse, Boyce and Pnsk, and Aseem
blvman Howard Wright. They .ignored
legislative topics for the time being arid
talked of cruisers, gunboats, battleships
and torpedo craft. .
Later in the day at the headquarters of
the Republican State committee and in
the court and corridors of the Palace
Hotel political topics engaged the atten
tion of visitins and resident statesmen.
Main- a hint was dropped to Jacob rsetT,
Lieutenant Governor-elect, concerning the
good qualities of this or that State Sen
ator for service on some important com
mittee. The Lieutenant Governor may
have some trouble in arranging committee
chairmanships to the entire satisfaction or
the Senate, but his difficulties will be triv
ial compared with those which Howard
Wright, as Speaker of the Assembly, will
encounter when the time comes for mak
ing up the committee lists of the lower
house. Already four Assemblymen aspire
to ihe position of chairman of the \\ ays
and Means Committee. Henry C. Dibble.
Grove L. Johnson, C. M. Belshaw and L.
H Valentine are candidates for this po
sition.
Republican leaders recognize that the
party will be held responsible for the acts
of the incoming Legislature. The Re
publicans control the executive depart
ment and both branches of the Legisla- j
ture, and will therefore be held account
able for all appropriations of public
money.
Some of the politicians perceive an ele
ment of danger to the party in the mag
nitude of the Republican majority. Should
the various State institutions and com
missions applying for allowances of
money combine, as they did in the noto
rious" Buckley Legislature of 1889, a
strength sufficient to overcome the ob
jections of the executive department
might be rallied. Assemblyman Wright
does not apprehend danger in this re
spect. He relies on the wisdom and
strength of the conservative forces to
hold the Legislature in check.
Whatever may be said concerning the
wisdom and virtue of the Legislature, the
people generally build their hopes of
economical administration on the firm
ness of the chief executive officer.
The chairman of the. Senate Finance
Committee can accomplish much good in
keeping appropriations within a proper
limit. At the recent convention of min
ers Governor Budd expressed regret that
Senator Voorheis had retired from legis
lative service, remarking that the Ama
dor Senator, as chairman of that com
mittee, had saved the State a million dol
lars. Senator S. C. Smith of Kern Coun
ty is spoken of as a man possessing many
of the qualities that a chairman of the
Finance Commiee should possess.
The coyote claims are bound to engage
the attention of tne incoming Legislature.
It is said that the claims are now in the
hands of a few respected bankers, and
that the work of handling the bill for
the payment of bounties will not be in
trusted* to talkative agents.

HOMELESSâ
What a dreary sound the word has! It Is
associated in the mind with loneliness, hunger
'. and threadbare clothing. Yet all homeless
people are not poor. Some of them are
merely unwise. They continue to live In
. rented houses, when they might with the
. same rent money possess a home of their
. own. To be sure they have a temporary
: " abiding place which they try to delude them-
selves to believe is â¢â¢home." But they pay
- . rentâ taxâ for it. Why not have the papers
â¢ drawn differently ? Instead of a rent receipt
â  â  let it be an Installment receipt, and the
monthly payments that now go to the land-
lord, leaving you as homeless as ever, will
."â . remain with you. Every month's payment
. â  brings your home so much nearer. It's easy.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 27, 1898.
CLINTON SAYS
HE WAS WRONGED
Makes a Reply to Father
Yorke's Speech.
A REVIEW OF THE SAILORS'
HOME CONTROVERSY.
Attributes His Defeat to Prejudice Created
Aganst Him by the Speeoh Made
at Oakland.
â¢â â  â 
On learning the day before the recent
election that the Rev. Peter C. Torke
intended leaving the city on the follow
ing day, 1 caused to be submitted to
him the following affidavits, and trans
cripts from official records, refuting the
charges he had made against me in his
recent Oakland speech and pamphlet,
which he had distributed all over the
city on the eve of the election, and re
questing him to retract said charges,
otherwise I would be compelled, in de
fense of my good name, to publish
them.
' Father Yorke read the papers and
thereupon positively refused to make
any retraction. I took the precaution
to "thus give him fair warning of my
Intention to publish the papers, so that
he could not charge me with making a
-cowardly attack" on him during his
absence. Although already in posses
sion of this evidence, I deliberately de
clined to use it in support of my can
didacy during the closing week of the
campaign, for the reason that my de
sire for re-election to the office of Su
pervisor was subservient to my deter
mination to protect and vindicate my
good name in the community, and be
cause I well knew that owing to the
prejudice created against me by Father
Yorke I would not receive the calm and
unbiased judgment, which at the pres
ent timeâ the excitement of the elec- i
tion having subsidedâ l confidently
hope to receive from my fellow-citizens.
In his pamphlet Father Yorke says:
"When the question (Sailors' Home)
was first before the board Dr. Clinton
was reported as having made a motion
to give the home to the old sectarian
society. ' *
This is erroneous. My first official
act regarding the matter was taken at
the meetintr of the board last February,
when I offered the following resolu
tions:
"Whereas, There are two applications
for a lease of the building formerly
used as the United States Marine Hos
pital for the purpose of conducting and
maintaining a 'Sailors' Home'; and
"Whereas, It appears that the La
dies' Seamen's Friend Society have
heretofore conducted and maintained a
sailors' home in the said building under
a lease from the city and county; and
"Whereas, It is desirable that such
an institution, as well as all other pub
lic institutions, should be conducted on
non-sectarian principles so that their
usefulness may be extended and not re
stricted or abridged; therefore
"Resolved, That full power and au
thority is hereby conferred upon his
Honor, the Mayor, to make, execute
and deliver a lease of this property for
a term of two (2) years for the purpose
of a 'Sailors' Home' to such corpora
tions who may be organized for the
purpose of conducting a home for Bail
ors on non-sectarian principles, and to
make such conditions as may be con
ducive to conducting such home in the
manner and for the purposes as herein
set forth. (Signed) C. A. CLINTON."
"February 7, 1898."
The resolution was not adopted. It
was an earnest though futile effort on
my part to settle amicably the wholÂ«
question and thus save our city from
the infliction of another religious
wordy war, which should be avoided, if
possible, by all good citizens.
The pamphlet readÃ:
CLINTON'S COWARDICE.
"As soon as Dr. Clinton thought I
was helpless and could not answer he
comes forward with an attack on me
in the shape of a letter, supposedly
written by the sectarian society."
Now, in the first place, I was not
aware of Father Yorke's illness. In
the second, 1 was not the author of the
letter In question. In the third, cow
ardice is not a factor in my make-up.
In refutation. of the charge that I was
the author of the letter, or that I had
inspired it, I submit the following:
"To Whom It May Concern: This is
to affirmâ upon oath, if necessaryâ that
the article of explanation in reference
to the history and present condition of
the Sailors' Home, which recently ap
peared in the leading city dailies, was
written by the request of the board of
managers and trustees of the Sailors'
Home for three specific reasons:
"First â To Inform our right-minded
citizens concerning the history of an as
sociation which for forty years had
held its ground and numbered among
its managers some of the most reliable !
and philanthropic people in the State.
"Second â To refute incorrect state
ments concerning Its management, to
which publicity had been given through
the press.
"Third â To publicly express our
gratitude to those Supervisors who had !
nobly battled for our rights, some
of whom we know * having suffered
much abuse and defamation through
their efforts in our behalf.
"(Signed)
"MRS. NELLIE BLESSING EYSTER,
"Treasurer of Ladies' Seamen's Re
lief Society.
"November 1, 1898."
Father Yorke In his lecture says:
"In regard to his protestations of in
dependence, Dr. Clinton bears the same
relation to J. F. English that Delany,
for instance, bears to Ralney. J. F.
English made Dr. Clinton and put him
in politics, and Dr. Clinton worships
his maker. J. F. English is in the com
mission business and sells potatoes and
onions and such things. Up to a few
months ago â voting that I have
spoken of took place In the summer
time â on the Ist of September I
learned from Larzelere & Co. of 320
Davis street that up to a few months
before that time they had supplied po
tatoes and onions to the Sailors' Home.
At that date the superintendent of the
Sailors' Home began to drive up to the
warehouse of Dr. Clinton's friend and
get his onions and his potatoes for the
institution.
. . "Of course one . good turn deserves
another, and it is :an Instructive 11 and
edifying fact that the vote of Dr.
Clinton should be rewarded by patron
age for Dr. Clinton's friend, and so the
Honorable 'Potato' Clinton r was not
able to give a reason why he had voted
to turn over the Sailors' Home to a
sectarian society,; but preferred to re
main silent in the absence of any rea
son." -V â¢
I am and have been for many years
Mr. English's family physician, and if
I had followed his advice I would never
have accepted public office.
With regard to Father Yorke's insin
uationâwhich, if true, would ibe In
famousâthat I had bartered my vote
in order to gain the patronage of the
Sailors' Home for Mr. English, I sub
mit the following affidavits":

has been there, I think, for some seven

lately. 1 find from my books that my
supplies to the Sailors' Home for the
current year â that is to say, for the
last ten monthsâ aggregate $111 96,
making the average sales to them $11

"3-0 Davis Street, San Francisco."
Father Yorke, in a letter in The Call
of the 2d inst. says:
"But the Mayor's innocence did not
exculpate Clinton and Dodge and Lack
mann. The Mayor's innocence in the
matter of the lease (Sailors' Home) did
not assoil them for their treachery in
voting for Chris Reis, the Indorsee of
the A. P. A."
Regarding this charge of the rev
erend gentleman I have only to say as
a matter of fact that I was not present
at the meeting of the Board of Super
visors at which Mr. Christian Reis was
elected treasurer, as the following cer
tified copy of the minutes proves:
"Copy of the minutes of the Board of
Supervisors of the city and county of

No. 159, at Its meeting held on April 23,

"The chair then declared Christian

"On motion the board adjourned to
meet on Monday afternoon, April 25.
1898. at 2 o'clock.
"JNO. A. RUSSELL. Clerk."
Father Yorke in his pamphlet dealing
with the action of the Board of Super
visors in re-leasing the Sailors' Home
to the Ladies' Seamen's Friend Society
"In the Monitor I called the attention
of the peopie to this monstrous wrong.
Among the members guilty I mentioned
Dr Clinton and he replied not by prov
ing that his vote was right, but by
saying that I was a liar."
Simply because I voted on the Sailors
Home question according to the dic
tate* of my conscience the reverend
gentleman jumped upon me with both
feet. He "mentioned" me by holding
me up to public scorn and obloquy. He
denounced me as "a vociferous re
former whose protestations of philan
thropy, of purity, of principle and of
common veracity the public should dis
count." That 1 had "cast aside even
the pretense of decency." He stigma
tized me as "a Judas who had betrayed
the sacred cause of religious liberty,"
and by innuendo he charged me with
having sold my vote.
Conscious of not having done any
wrong, and naturally indignant at the
unjust attack on my good name, I re
plied that the "Monitor's article, in so
far aa it touched me, was false, and x
hereby pronounce as equally false thfc
allegation Hiat I used the word 'liar 1
in my communication."
Continuing Father Yorke says:
"Dr. Clinton, with his eyes open,
voted that Catholics were not entitled
in this town to equal rights with Pro
testants. To this Dr. Clinton made no
answer. He did not dare to give the
reason he voted for the Apaist outfit of
the Sailors' Home."
This charge I brand as absolutely and
unequivocally false, as I will presently
prove.
I have already shown how I endeav
ored to secure for the Home an abso
lutely non-sectarian board of directors,
and having failed in this. I then turned
my attention to the management of
the Home, which up to this time I had
not had the opportunity to fully in
vestigate.
I instituted a thorough and conscien
tious investigation of the institution, its
officers, inmates, library, accounts, rec
ords, etc., and found that the state
ments contained in the communication
of the board of managers of the Sailors'
Horne â to which I have already re
ferredâwere, as far as I could ascer
tain, true, and were substantially as
follows:
Forty years ago a band of teroted
women, chiefly the wives and mother*
of sailors, after many years of hard
work, accumulated $30,000 for the pur
pose of providing a home for sailors in
our port, free from the influence of the
saloons and kindred temptations. The
old Marine Hospital having been con
demned and abandoned and fallen into
decay, these ladies petitioned Congress
for its use in order to enable them to
carry on their humane and disinter
ested work for the sailors. Their prayer
was granted and the lease of the oia
hospital was placed in the city, for^tne
only reason that the city was a PP r "
manency, while the society might aie
out and the lease consequently lapse.
I do not believe that It was ever con
templated that the city should manage
the home, or that it should be con
sidered either a State or national In
stitution. And further, I believe that
if the city had been required as a con
ditiun of the lease to spend any money
to make the old building tenantable it
wouid not have been accepted.
The Ladies' Seamen's Friend Society
secured the franchise and spent their
hard-earned $30,000 in necessary per
manent improvements in order to make
the home habitable.
The home is not in the full sense of
the word a charitable institution. Board
and lodging is $5 a week to those who
\ are able to pay but no poor and worthy
sailor has ever been turned away from
its door on account of his poverty. In
this way many bad debts are con
tracted, as my examination of the
books revealed.
When a seaman is sick he la cared for
at the society's expense, a doctor is
provided and medicine supplied, and n
he dies he Is burled also at the so
ciety's expense.
No Inquiry into the denomination of
the sailor's religious belief is ever
made. Any minister, Catholic, Pro
testant or Jewish, is at liberty to hold
services in the chapel of the home.
Absolute liberty of conscience is given
to every inmate, and when sick each
I is permitted to call to his bedside any
religious teacher whom he may desire.
I found absolutely nothing in the li
brary, including the periodicals, etc., to
justify the charge made by Father
Yorke that "The vile publications of
the bigots, the obscene weeklies pro
duced by Jailbirds were supplied lavish
ly to the sailors." In a word, I found
the home, as stated by Mayor Phelan
after he~had thoroughly investigated
it, conducted in a business-like and
proper manner.
The society, however, was composed
exclusively of Protestants; a Protestant
chaplain was employed and religious
services were held for those inmates
of the home who wished to attend
them. At the instance of Mayor Phe
lan these sectarian features were elim
inated. Services by the chaplain were
discontinued and Catholic ladies were
elected as members of the board of di
rectors. These concessions, the Mayor
assured me, were perfectly satisfactory
to Father Yorke, and Supervisor Rot
tanzi informed me that he had sub
mitted the terms of the proposed lease
to the Rev. Father^Mulligan^segretary
to the Archbishop, and that they weit
: ! y sat isfactory to him.
Considering all the circumstances, as
a conscientious public servant, I came
to the deliberate conclusion that if the
Board of Supervisors should take the
home away from those humane and
philanthropic women, who had spent
the best years of their lives in perfect
ing it, and had expended upward of
$60,000 in keeping up the Improvements,
and hand it over to another society
which had made application for it, and
which society was without experience
in the management of such a difficult
business and had done nothing what
ever in creating it, the act, to my mind,
would be nothing less than a species of
robbery; the Board would be fairly
open to the charge of bigotry and every
fair-minded man and woman in the
community would be justly arrayed
against them.
These were the just considerations
which moved me to support Supervisor
Lackmann's motion â not my motion, as
claimed by Father Yorkeâ to renew
thelease to the Ladies' Seamen's Relief
Society, and I so stated them before
voting, although Father Yorke has re
peatedly asserted that "I did not dare
to tell the reason for my vote/* For
instance, In~h!s Oakland speech the
Rev. Father says:
"I had to leave the city during the
time the convention was going on, but
I left word at the Monitor office that
any kind of a letter at all that he might
send should be printed and put before
the public to set him right with his own
people. Dr. Clinton refused to give any
explanation if his vote. Dr. Clinton did
not dare to tell the reason why he had
voted to turn over municipal property
to a sectarian institution."
I did not consider it necessary to
â¢write "any kind of a letter at all" to
Father Yorke in the further explana
tion of my vote. My course in the mat
ter was fully understood by the reading
publicâ it was plain and above board,
and I had nothing to explain to the
reverend gentleman, my "own people"
or any one else.
Of those voting for the motion seven
were co-religionists of Father Yorke,
and their act was ratified by the Mayor,
himself of the same faith. Now, I do
not believe there is a man or woman
in this whole city so narrow-minded,
so unreasonable as to believe for a mo
ment that these eight men were as
Father Yorke charges, "Judases who
betrayed the sacred cause of religious
liberty by voting: to deliver the poor
Catholic sailors to a bigoted sectarian
society."
The sacred principles of civil and re
ligious liberty are as dear to me as
they are to Father Yorke, and I yield
to no. one in my respect and love for
the constitution of our common coun
try, which guarantees to every citizen
equal civil and religious rights. I love
fair play with the same intensity of
feeling that I hate injustice.
When Apaism was rampant in this
city a few years ago I was among the
very first to publicly denounce it. With
voice, pen and purse, as far as my lim
ited means permitted, I fought it; and
Father Yorke in his glorious and suc
cessful battle against it had no more
earnest supporter than I.
My whole life has been a protest
against bigotry. When scarcely out of
my boyhood, in the land of my birth,
I did not hesitate when called upon to
obey the call of duty and prove my
devotion to the eternal principles of
civil and religious liberty.
In conclusion, I submit that the fore
going affidavits and transcripts from
official records completely refute the
charges fulminated against me by the
Rev. Father Yorke.
To the prejudice he created against
me during the closing days of the late
campaign I frankly attribute my de
feat at the polls.
The reverend gentleman proved him
self a chivalrous enemy.
He accomplished his purpose, and I
would not, If I could, deny him the
gratification which he undoubtedly
feels at the result.
His charges, although susceptible of
refutation, were to him "a ood enough
Morgan" during the few days of popu
lar excitement immediately preceding
the election, but, so far as I am con
cerned, the episode is now ended.
The fact that upward of 23,000 of my
fellow citizens refused to bejieve the
allegations of Father Yorke is sufficient
vindication of my course as a public
servant. That this army of freemen
upheld by their suffrages the principle
which was involved in my candidacy is
adequate satisfaction to me aa I retire
to the enjoyment of private life.
I did not receive justice from Father
Yorke.
I confidently look for It In the
opinion* of my fallow citliens, without
regard tQ creed or party, whÂ«n they
shall have calmly considered the facts
which I lay before them.
My career in San Francisco for the
past twenty-seven years is an open
book. In public as well as in private
life I was honored with the confidence
and good will of the people long be
fore the Rev. Father Yorke set foot in
California.
I have done m v best to prove worthy
of their confidence and good will. I
deeply deplore the course pursued by
the Rev. Peter C. Yorke since his entry
j into the arena of politics In California,
and I earnestly hope that the reverend
gentleman may never again perpetrate
I aerainst any of his fellow citizens an
I injustice such as he has inflicted upon
the motives and good name of â Yours

RAZING OF THE
HOTEL RUINS
AGAIN DELAYED
Baldwin Wanted Fur
niture Removed.
â¢
WRECKING RESUMED TO-DAY
BIG CROWDS WATCH WORKMEN
IN PERILOUS PLACES.
Traffic on Market Street Repeatedly
Interrupted â Police Had a Hard
Job Keeping the Crowd
Out of Danger.
An unusually large Saturday afternoon
crowd thronged Market street yesterday,
and gave the police a deal of trouble in
the neighborhood of the Baldwin Hotel
.ruins.
A large force of officers was on duty keep
ing people outside the danger line around
the tottering walls. In hundreds of cases
warnings were unheeded, and the officers
were compelled to lay hands on men and
women alike to get them on to the farther
sidewalk and keep them moving. Crowds
of idlers stood all day in front of the
Emporium, gazing at the wrecked hotel
and keeping close watch on every move
ment in and about the buildings. The
center of interest was in front of the
theater, where Mays- wrecking gang was
attempting to finish the, demolition so
nearly completed by fire.
Only a small portion of the dangerous
walls was pulled down. During the fore
noon the wreckers worked hard on the
Market street side, but they did not ac
complish much, owing to the Inadequacy
of their machinery. The heavy cable
which was attached to the iron girders
broke repeatedly when the windlass was
turned and the strain became great.
Early in the morning George Renworth
and William Mays, the intrepid climbers,
went up the Insecure lire escape, over the
loosened cornice and attached the cable
to the unsupported chimney, which sways
back and forth with every breeze. Mer
chants, clerks and laborers on their way
to work stopped to gaze at the two men
at their perilous vocation, and when a
brick or piece of charred timber came
crashing to the ground the spectators ex
pected to see the two men toppled over
into the debris five stories beneath. The
workmen paid no attention to these things
or to the crowd below. Familiarity with
danger had deadened whatever fear they
may have had, and they proceeded with
their work with the utmost unconcern.
When the line was made fast to the
chimney Renworth and Mays descended
and half a dozÂ£n men began winding at
the '"crab." A turn or two and tho
slack was all taken up. Then the specta
tors became intensely interested. All
traffic was stopped on Market street, and
the police forced the curious crowd be
yond the danger line. The men at the
capstan were soon pushing the long han
dle bar with all their might, the ropes
tightened and the chimney began to bend
inward. Anather turn and the pile of
brick and iron seemed about to topple
over, when the cable snapped with a loud
crack. The crab Jumped from its moor
ings and the men were thrown on their
faces. The chimney swung back to its
original position and for a moment looked
as though it would fall outward. Several
subsequent attempts to demolish the
chimney were made, but the cable would
not stand the strain, so operations were
transferred to another section of the wall.
The climbers again ascended to the
top, this*time to a more dangerous posi
tion than the first, and tied the cable to
the iron girder on the fifth floor. This time
the efforts of the wreckers were success
ful, and after a hard pull an immense
section of the overhanging debris tum
bled within the walls with a rumble and
a roar which could be heard blocks away.
A cloud of dust enshrouded the ruins for
a few moments and prevented further
operations until it had settled.
The end of the cable was again car
ried to the fourth floor and wound around
another girder, but at this juncture
"Lucky" Baldwin ordered the wreckers
to cease work until considerable furni
ture of little value had been removed
from the rooms which were only partially
burned. The remainder of the day was
consumed in lowering sofas, tables,
pianos, wardrobes, etc., to the ground.
To-day the work of pulling down the
walls will be resumed.
No search for bodies of victims of tne
fire trap can be made for several days as
the wreckers will not have the dangerous
wall down before Tuesday or Wednesday
When the searchers for the dead do begin
removing the debris they cannot reach
the bodies for another week, as the walls
are to be entirely razed, which will inter
fere with digging hi the ruins.
Madison & Burke have asked for bids
for wrecking what remains of the hotel
but they have nothing to say about the
probable erection of a new hotel. It is
reported that the Hibernia Bank will, in
order to protect its large mortgages on
Baldwin's property, advance him the nec
essary funds to rebuild. Another rumor
is that several wealthy men and a cor-,
poratlon or two are very anxious to buy
the property and have opened negotiations
with Baldwin.
Apprehension regarding the number of
dead who lie buried in the blackened mass
of debris increases from hour to hour.
Persistent rumors that several well
known people are missing and that their
families believe they perished in the
flames continue to circulate. Attempts
to verify these reports are being made,
but the Interested relatives swear that
the absent members of the family are out
of town, adding that no information reÂ«
garding their whereabouts can be gtrao.
There is now no doubt that the last body
taken from the debris is that of Tate
Pryor. A telegram from Mrs. Pryor, giv
ing a detailed description of her husbands
teeth, which corresponds with the teeth
in the remains at the Morgue, establishes
a complete identification.

I A Miraculous Escape.
Among: the losers in the Baldwin Ho
tel fire was the Baldwin Jewelry Com
pany. However, their patrons will not
lose a cent, because all the valuable
stock and papers were saved. Through
the energy and enterprise of the mana
gers, aided by the efficient Fire Dis
patch Association, in which organiza
tion the company has very wisely kept
up membership ever since their incor
poration, on August 1, 1896, all .the
movable effects were removed to and
new headquarters opened up across the
street in the Parrott building, room
408. This was all done lon~ before day
light, while the fire was still burning
fiercely, and the work was attended
with no small amount of danger from
falling timbers, hot ashes and cinders.
Besides the protection of the Fire
Dispatch and Bursrlar Alarm compa
nies, as a further precaution against
losses to their patrons by fire and store
breakers the directors of the jewelry
company have always adhered rigidly
to the rule of placing all articles valued
above $50 every night in a public safe
deposit vault. All other articles of
j value were kept in a tested fireproof
safe, so that, save for a slight wetting,
everything besides the store furniture
is now in good shape in their temporaÂ«p
! office in the Parrott building. 7
New and larger quarters are now be
ing fitted up and will be ready for oc
cupancy in a few days at 84R Market
street, just a block below the old store.*

Makes a Discovery in
Pig-Stealing.
DISAPPOINTMENT AND JOY
MENDONCAS AND DT7ARTES IN A
HAYWAEDS COURT.
A Fifteen-Dollar Porker Causes a
Trial That Brings Out a Large
Part of the Town
ship.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Nov. 26.
Judge Allen's first appearance as repre- ;
sentative of the District Attorney's .office
(in which department he is serving a few
â¢weeks" apprenticeship prior to taking
charge on January 1) produced a little
comedy that amused and disappointed a
large portion of Haywards.
In Judge Pimental'scourt Mr. Mendonca
was charged by the people with stealing |
a pig, the property of Mr. Duarte. Ap
parently the Portuguese residents of Eden
Township are about equally divided, half
of them b#ing friends of tiie Mendoncas
and the other half being friends of the j
Duartes. They were all in the courtroom
when Judge Allen opened the case for the
people. The Judge had not gone far when
he discovered that he was on the short
end of the argument. Whoever drew up
the complaint made the fatal error of
charging Mr. Mendonca. with a felony, to
wit, the stealing of a pig.
â¢'lf your Honor please," said Judge
Allen, addressing Judge Pimental, "I do
not feel like going any further in this j
rase. Mr. Mer.duuca. is charged with steal
ng a pig. Many years ago, when pigs
were scarce in California, as your Honor ]
doubtless remembers, it was declared to j
be grand larceny to steal one. After
ward this statute was modified, and the
State of California .does not now hold it !
to be a felony to steal a pig. and therefore j
the charge of grand larceny must of ne
cessity be dismissed."
Attorneys Mickle and "Whaley. who ap- ;
peared for Mendonca, made a little argu- i
ment, after which Judge Pim< ntal ue- I
clared that a new complaint must be :
drawn if the case must go to trial. Judge I
Allen nnoved for a dismissal, which was :
granted and the alleged pigstealer was
discharged So bitter is the feeling be- ;
tween the Mendoncaa and the Duartes
that Attorn. George S. Langan has been
retained to assist the prosecution, al- '
though the pis is only valued at $13.
Mendonca declares that he found the
pig on the highway and took it home; but
Duarte declares it was taken from his
p*>n. There is also much doubt as to the
value of the pig. and it will probably be i
produced In court and expert testimony
given regarding Its pedigree when the
trial for petty larceny takes place.
Mr Mendonca'a friends were highly
elated at the partial success, or ifÂ» â â¢â â¢
fendant; but now that in case of convic- â¢
tion he can be sent to no place more in
convenient than the County Jail the
friends of >iart.-> have lost part of their
interest In the case.
GOLD FOUND IN A
DEAD MISER'S HOUSE
END OF CAPTAIN TIBBETTS' RO-
M ANTIC LITE.
In Early Life Was an Arctic Explor
erâLived Forty Years at
Irvington.
â¢ Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, Nov. 20.
The Irvington recluse, Captain M. Tib
betts. is dead. Yesterday he was found in
an unconscious condition and was taken
by friend* to a more comfortable home
than his cabin. He died without becom-
Ing conscious. . . . W.
The old captain has lived at ashing
ton Corners for forty years, and it is
always supposed that he has been a miser.
This opinion was strengthened last even-
Ing when Constable Vr.ndervoort found
several hundred dollars in a corner of the
old house where the captain lived. The
Bearch. is being continued, but as the
shanty is full of corners and material col
lected during half a century, the task
cannot be done thoroughly and speedily.
Captain Tibbetts frequently told visitors
to his house that he was the only sur
vivor of the British expedition to the
Arctic that left England in the 30 s. He
was at that time little more than a boy,
but he remembers distinctly the exciting
incidents of the expedition. He came to
California in 1850. The vessel In which
he rounded the Horn was under his com
mand and after arriving here he en-
L-ae-ed in the " coasting trade; between
Puget Sound and San Francisco, and
made considerable money. Eight years
later he owned a boat which he put into
the produce business between Kowry s
Landing, near Irvington and San ran
cisco. He bought a small place at Irving
ton many years ago and has since resided
there He was never known to leave the
town,' and the presumption was that he
kept -whatever he possessed in his little
home. No will has yet been found, anil
It is believed that the captain has no
relatives living.

Contestant alleges that the will, dated

The taxpayers of this county are likely
to be greatly disappointed unless the Su
pervisors shall make an appropriation for
getting out the annual iinancial report of
: the various departments of the county
government This report has been pre
: by County Clerk Jordan for each
; of the past three years, and has done
more to open the eyes of the people as
to what goes on in the county buildings
| than anything else ever published. Ip
; to this time no appropriation has been
made lor this work, and the County
Clerk has done it largely as a matter
:of pride. Now he declares that having
i spent fully a thousand dollars a year out
: of his own appropriation for three years,
he doea not feel it incumbent upon him
i to do it this year, and his contention is
not unreasonable.
Next year under the new county gov
ernment act it Will be the duty of County
i Auditor Kwing to prepare this statistical
, report, but there is not likely to be any
ft>r this year.
The break in the issue of the reports
should be avoided if possible, for there
is much public curiosity regarding the
manner in which the county officers have
done their work during the past year.
than ever is it important tnat the
report should be prepared, because, with
out It there can be no intelligent com
parison drawn of the effect ot the new
county government act. This act goes
: into effect next January and provides that
1 instead of immense appropriations for the
i different departments of the county gov
ernment, each official shall draw Â« salary
r and shall be provided with depulfes, the
salaries ot whom are also fixed. It would
: be- interesting to know the difference be
', tween the cost for this year under the
1 go-as-you-please plan and how it com
i pares with the new schedule of next year.
if the Supervisors can legally appropriate
money to prepare the annual report, and
it is said that they can, it should be pre

There is already some talk of trying
to bring about other changes than those
contained in the new act. Between now
and the opening of the Legislature there
will be a conference between the legisla
tive delegation from this county and the
county officials, relative-to these proposed
changes. Two years ago the county of
ficials swarmed the halls of the Capitol
and subjected the legislators to much
Inconvenience and work by continually
f"isting upon them their Individual views.
This time all this is to be avoided and
the legislators are to be made aware be
fore going t" Sacramento of what the
county officials consider necessary. There
is much dissatisfaction with some officers
regarding the pas-ment of a lump salary
of S-iOOQ pÂ«Â»r year. They will attempt to
have it raised to $6000, although it has
already been demonstrated that $4000 is
a very munificent pay. especially when
compared with the salariei of State offi
cials who receive but $3000.

BERKELEY. Nov. 26.-Dr. C. F. Glad
ding, a well-known physician of West
Berkeley, was served with a warrant from
Justice Cliffs court to-day charging him
with disturbing the peace.
The summons is the outcome of an af
fair In which Dr. Gladding, Dr. Alfred
de Marconnay and I. Wolff of the M<Â«iet
drug store were the principals, and the
drug store and the sidewalk the chief
scenes of action. Dr. Marconnay acted as
peacemaker.
â  There was some vigorous calling of hard
names, threats of personal violence and
the usual incidents of v war of words.
It Is stated that Dr. Gladding entered the
store, accused Wolff of defaming him
and called the druggist a "cur." The lat
ter denied the allegation, ordered the phy
sician out of the place and promised to
do violence to the medico. Dr. de Mar

avoided.

CHARITABLE WORK OF
SCHOOL CHILDREN
GEOWD OF LITTLE FOLKS EN
TERTAINED AT A BANQUET.
Pupils of the Alameda Public Schools
Engage in a Worthy Under
taking.
ALAMEDA. Nov. 26.â Nearly 150 little
children, upon whose parents Dame For
tune has frowned, were treated to a
Thanksgiving dinner to-day provided by
the pupils of the Alameda School Depart
ment. The affair took place at Masonic
Temple and was the crowning success of
a project undertaken by the young folks
several months ago. The usual good
things of a Thanksgiving dinner were on
the bill of faro. The school children pre
pared the dishes and served the banquet
and did everything possible to make the
joy of their little guests complete. The
banquet room was decorated with smilax,
ivy and holly berries, and bouquets of flow
ers from the Alameda gardens adorned
the tables. The banquet started at 2
o'clock In the afternoon and it was nearly
dusk when the children retired.
The Idea of entertaining the poor chil
dren at a Thanksgiving dinner originated
with Miss Emma Postel. a student at the
Porter Grammar School. Committees
from all the schools were appointed to as
sist in the work. They gave an enter
tainment at Armory Hall to assist in de
fraying the expenses of the dinner, and
what was lacking was cheerfu!ly\made
up by the mc-rchants of Alameda.
The committee of arrangements was
Miss Emma Postel. Miss Ethel Seiden
berg. Miss Ruby Schloss, William Butler
and Miss Alice JooÃt. Foster Griffiths
acted as chief cook of the banquet. The
waiters were: Henry Behnemann, Willie
McStay, Albert Butler. Ralph Davis,
Thomas Stacknole. Thomas Benton. Paul
Shattuck, Nick Reinecker Jr., Arthur
Donovan, Alfred Zadlg and Edwin Cooley.
CRUSHED BY AN ELEVATOR.
Mortimer Truett, a Teamster. Instantly Killed in
Front of the V, M, C. A, Building,
MORTIMER K. TRUETT, a team
ster, who resided at 132 A Twelfth
street, was crushed and instantly
killed last evening in a freight
elevator on the sidewalk in front
of the White Sewing Machine Com
pany at 138 Ellis street, in the Y. M.
C. A. building. He was employed by
the company, and the accident which
cost him his life happened while he
was attempting to close the iron doors
covering the elevator.
The man's body was found about 7
o'clock by W. R- Martin, but he had
been killed two hours before. Truett
drove up to the building shortly before
5 o'clock, and, noticing that the ele
vator bad not been closed, remarked
that he would close it, as the man
whose duty it was to see that the doors
weie locked was busy. He went into
the bascVnent, and was not seen from
that time until his body was discov
ered.
It is the belief of Mr. Martin that
Truett got on the ele/ator and raised
it iii^'n enough tc. enable him to dose
the Iron doors above his head, and then
when he went to lower It pulled the
wrong rope, causing the elevator to
BRANDES AND
WIFE CHARGED
WITH MURDER
Complaints Sworn to
by Marshal Lloyd.
ARRAIGNMENT NEXT MONDAY
IMPORTANT PHOTOGRAPHS OF
THE MURDERED GIRL.
No Time to Be Lost in Trying the
Accused, Who Are Still
Separated by Prison
Walls.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway. Nov. 26.
Two complaints were filed this after
noon in Justice of the Peace Cliffs court
which will begin the legal battle over the
strong chain of circumstantial evidence
that surrounds the cruel and cold-bdooded
murder of 13-year-old Lillian Brandes at
Berkeley on the 19th inst.
In one complaint William A. Brandes is
charged with murder and in the other
Mrs. Etta Brandes, his wife, is charged
with the same crime. There Is no dis
tinction made, though it had been sup
posed that the wife would be held only
as an accessory.
Both complaints are sworn to by Rich
ard Lloyd, Marshal of Berkeley, who has
taken an active part in collecting evi
dence which was used at the inquest. Ihe
complaints are written in the usual or
dinary form and were prepared by Dis
trict Attorney-elect J. J. Allen, who, with
Deputy District Attorney Harry Melvin,
will conduct the prosecution from begin
ning to end. _ M .Â»
The warrants were served by Constable
K-i Weuller late this afternoon at the
County Jail, and the accused man and
wife will be arraigned in Justice Clift s
court next Monday afternoon at 2 o'clock,
of which fact Attorney Eugene Deuprey,
in the meantime, will have been advised,
for he has so requested. Deuprey. how
ever, had not up to to-day consented to
defend Mrs. Brandes.
The testimony as taken before the Coro
ner's jury established such a strong case
in itself that the prosecution builds on the
: most formidable hopes of conviction.
A feature of the trial will be the lntro
' duction In evidence of certain important
I photographs taken to-day at the instance
i of District Attorney Snook. ' These are
photos of the dead girl and the wounds
from blows tiiat led to her death.
Brandes is still depressed and now
views with alarm the serious charge that
has been placed at his door. He is not
permitted to see his wife, and thus they
1 have no opportunity of comparing notes
and stories upon which to base a coincid
ing defense.
Officer Swain of the local police has
received several letters from parties at
Mcnterey who were acquainted with the
I murdered girl and all of whom write that
â  she was a child of many good traits and
â  was bright. These clearly refute Brandes'
statement that the girl was ignorant and
i half-witted..

rise. Thf> head was caught between the
girder and the floor of the elevator,
showing that Truett had seen his dan
ger and attempted to jump. Had he
remained on the platform the chances
are that he would have escaped with a
few bruises.
Truett was 55 years old. He had been
employed by the White Sewing Ma
chine Company for a number of years,
and was generally respected by his
employers and the large number of
friends he had made during his life.
He leaves a widow, who Is at present

WATER FRONT
OF ALAMEDA TO
BE IMPROVED
May Be Leased to a
Syndicate.
WHARVES TO BE BUILT
PROJECTORS WILL RTTN A FERRY
TO SAN FRANCISCO.
It Is Proposed to Construct a Land
ing Place and Warehouses at
the Foot of Prospect
Street.
ALA MED A, Nov. 2J.â Alameda's water
front, which was acquired by a settle
ment of the suit to partition the marsh
land north of the city, will be improved.
Agitation Is already on foot to build
wharves, coal-bunkers and warehouses
on the city's property. An organization
was formed to-day to be known as the
Improvement Syndicate, and the object ot
its projectors Is to make an offer to lease
the city's water front at the foot of Pros
pect street for a term of ten years.
There is 960 feet of j frontage at that
place, and if the offer of the syndicate,
is accepted work will be commenced at
an early date on the construction of a
wharf and coal-bunkers. At the present
time there is not a place on the shore of
Alameda where a vessel of any kind can
discharge a cargo. The merchants, pro
i duce dealers and coal men are compelled
to deal entirely through Oakland people.
This necessitates an extra outlay for
transportation and drayage, which it is
calculated, would be avoided if the city
had a wharf of its own. Several mer
i chants have taken an interest in the Im
provement Syndicate and claim that ir
its plans are carried out Alameda will be
enabled to deal almost directly with the
producers and will not have to handle its
goods through the middlemen of Oak-
a Th*e Prospect street site for a wharf Is
an admirable- one in point of location, as
the roads leading to it are convenient to
all parts of the city. It has long been
Alameda's ambition to have a water front
lined with monufacturies, warehouses and
other evidences of business activity, ana
the movement of the Improvement Syn
dicate is the first actual step taken in
that direction. An option has been se
cured on a sternwheel steamer which will
be used in transporting < freight between
Alameda and San Francisco.
The gentlemen connected with the en
terprise, while admitting that they will
endeavor to secure a lease of the city s
water front, say it is too early yet to
discuss their plans in detail. It is known
they are trying to interest several cap
italists In their project, and if they suc
ceed they will commence operations at

A WARNING TO THOSE
WHO WOULD LOBBY
IMPORTANT DECISION IN A CO
LUSA COUNTY CASE.
Attorney F. S. Sprague Loses a Fee
Promised by the Supervisors.
They Exceeded Their
Powers.
The Supreme Court handed down a de
cision yesterday in which there is some
gmxl law on the matter of lobbying-. It
.was In the case of the District Attorney
of Colusa County against R. F. Welch,
the Treasurer. The former sought to re
strain the latter from paying $1000 to F.
1 S. Sprapue on an authorization of the
Board of Supervisors.
Sprague Is an attorney and the Super
visors hired him to so to Sacramento
to attend the Legislature that met in ISM.
He was hired to "lo'bny" In the interests
of Colusa County by defeating the pass
age of an "act to provide for tho ad
justment of Indebtedness and assets be
tween any county that has been created
or may hereafter be created, and the
county or counties from the territories
of which said new county may be cre
ated."
Glenn County was the new county that
had been created from the territory of
Colus-a and it was to the Interest of the
latter county to defeat the passage of the
act. *
In the lower court the alleged contract
between the Board of Superivsors and
Spragrue was upheld, but the Justices of
the higher court took a different view
of the matter, holding that such a con
tract was in excess of the power vested
In the Board of Supervisors and hence it
was. void. The point was raised by the
defendant that it la the duty of the Su
pervisors to preserve the interests of the
county and that they were authorized un
der the law to employ a special attorney
to maintain such interest. The Supreme
Court disposes of this argument by say
ing':
In thÂ© case at bar the Supervisors hnj no
duty In the premiss to perform. They had no
authority to Influence or to employ others to
influence the Leg-islature In the notion which
in its wisdom it should Â«cc fit to take. If the
board could do so in the present case, then
by parity of reasoning it could do sj in ail
matters of reveuue, and in ait oases wttfch
might indirectly affect the interests of the
crmnty. If the board of a sriven county may
exercise such authority, then like boards of all
other counties may exercise like authority In
Ilka capes, and there is a possibility of a corps
of attorneys being always in attendance upon
sessions of the Legislature to influence the
actions of. members Jh matters confided to the
JiniKTnt'nt of the latter. There Is no sijeh au
thority siven either directly or by implication
t-> Boarcis of Supervisor, and the attempt t.>
exercise it by the board in the case at bar was
null and void.
The Judgment and order of the lower
court was reversed and Mr. Sprague will
not be paid for lobbying. '

HEAVY RUNS
Grueling Courses at
Ingieside.
VERY . SPEEDY SAPLINGS
COUNTERFEIT AND FLASHLIGHT
WERE EXHAUSTED.
Sports Who Played the Short Enda
Fared Well for a While, buc
Lost Heavily on the
Finals.
To -the surprise of many critical observ
ers, the performances of the saplings that
contested yesterday at Ingleside Coursing
Park were of a very high order, and The
Call's tips won every course excepting
one, and that was the race between Babe
King: and Hattabell, which was easily won
by Hattabell. who. however, was beaten
subsequently by Maggie N, a probable
stakewinner.
In the non-winners' stake the coursing
was truly excellent. In fact, the coursing
pleasures of the day can be attributed in
a great measure to the wonderful running
of the hares, a number of which, after
carrying their pursuers from end to end
of the field, escaped, in the language of
Tom McHugh, "with flying colors." Out
of the thirty-six courses which composed
the run down The Call was again suc
cessful in tipping thirty winners. The pik
ers were fairly successful up to the tweij^
ty-second course of the day, when the long
shots got in and held possession to the
end of the run down. Those who played
the short ends won on Emerald, a 1 to 4
shot, against Brutus; at Last against
Fear Not; Commodore â¢against Mission I
Tip; Prince George against KiUarney
Lass; Counterfeit against Flashlight;

Spirited Running With the Favorites
i Leading for the Opening Stake.
The running at Union Coursing- Park
yesterday was spirited and with three
notable exceptions the favorites came in
first. In the first race of the day, in the
puppy stake. Miss Skyball beat Rose of
Tralee, an 8 to 1 favorite, in a flukey
course. and Prince Jerome beat Cam
pania, a 3 to 1 shot.
Interest centered in the two new im
ported dogs, Crawford Lad, v.ho was
rated 2 to 1 in favor over all the dogs at
the park, and Crawford Braes. Both dogs
have been heavily touted and much was
expected, but Maid of Erin : beat out
Crawford Lad handily, though she was
led up to the hare by two open lengths.
I After the turn she ran up a sequence of
a half dozen points, beating the touted
dog with ease. Following is the result

COUGH
DON'T COUGH.
There is nothing more irritable to a
cough than coughing.
Constant coughing is like scratching
a wound; so long as it is done the
wound will not heal. When tempted to
cough draw a long breath and hold it
until it warms and soothes every air
cell, and some benefit will soon be re-
ceived from this process. The nitrogen
which is thus refined acts on the mu-
cous membrane, allays the desire to
y.ough and gives the throat and lungs
a chance to heal. At the same time the
use of "77" will aid nature in her efforts
to recuperate.

the Carpenters' District Council waa held,
last evening to take action regarding the
construction of the new buildings in Cen
tral Park.
William Wehner of San Jose has let out
a contract to Senate & aicCafm of this
city for the construction of a circular
building to be vied as a cyclorama. Tha
building Is of rather flimsy construction
and will be built almost wholly of wood
and canvas with a covering of sheetiron.
Work was begun on It a few days ago,
but from the start the contractors have
violated trade rules by employing non
union labor, working the men over hours
and paying wages far below the union
rates. The contractors have positively
refused to act in conformity with the
rules of the union, and the union men in
turn will tight them in every possible way.
The union men employed on the structure
will be called off at once ami at the meet
ings on Wednesday, Thursday and Fri
day plans will be formulated for further
action
It is probable that a protest will be sent
to the fire wardens against the erection
of such a building within the fire limits,
as some of the building experts in the
council declare that it is notÃing but a
flretrap and a menace to surrounding
property. __^_

NOT ONE CASE
OF THE PLAGUE
IN CHINATOWN
An Outrageous Rumor i
Found to Be False.
PUZZLED BYASTRANGE DEATH
CHINESE CONSUL REPORTED
BUBONIC DEATHS.
Investigation. Shows His Mistake and
He Makes Formal Acknowledg
ment of the Error â Quar
antine Discontinued.
No cases of bubonic plague have been
discovered In Chinatown. This is the
definite 6tatement made conjointly by
by Health Officer Gallwey, City Bacteri
ologist Spencer and Dr. Williamson of
the Board of Health.
An alarming report that four Chinamen
had died of bubonic plague reached the
Health Office Friday morning through a
verbal report made to Health Officer Gall
wey by the Chinese Consul in San Fran
cisco. This repor#' was to the effect that
Leong Chun Chew of 913 Dupont street
had died of a mysterious disease, believed
to be the black plague, and three other
Chinamen, whose names the Consul u-d
not give, were thought to have fallen vic
tims to the same dread disease.
The semi-official aspect of this infor
mation created considerable alarm in the
mi::d of the Health Officer, and he at once
telephoned to the various members of the
Board of Health, asking them to meet im
mediately in special session at the Health
Office. Every member responded without
delay, and within thirty minutes the
Mayor convened the board and presented
the report of the Chinese Consul, as made
to Dr. Gallwey.
At first the board was inclined to pub
lish the Information "through the daily
newspapers, advising people to keep away
from the Chinatown district until an in
vestigation could be made. Telephonic
messages from the various papers, how
ever, concurred in the advice to give no
publicity to the matter until an investi
gation nad been made, especially as it
would require but a few hours to find out
the truth. It was not considered advisa
ble to create a scare which might do the
city great damage outside and which,
perhaps, would prove to be entirely un
justified.
The Board of Health agreed to this view
of the case and decided to immediately
send inspectors into Chinatown to watch
for any suspicious developments, while
Dr. Spencer, the City Bacteriologist, was
instructed to make an immediate investi
gation of the remains of Leong Chun
Chew, to ascertain whether the bacilli of
the bubonic plague were present or not. :
Inspectors were also ordered to quaran- I
Tine the house at 913 Dupont street and !
to quietly advise all persons approaching ;
the vicinity to go away. These instruc
tions were carried out to the letter. . i
Dr. Spencer, assisted by City Physician
Hereford and Dr. McMurdo, took posses
sion of the corpse of the dead Chinaman,
itnd yesterday made an extensive autopsy
at 734 Pacific street, cutting into all of the
vital organs and every suspected portion.
They found no traces of bubonic plague,
sven under careful microscopical examina
tion; but they did discover what they
considered to be plain evidence that tne
Chinaman came to his death from edema
of the lungs. As a result of the researches
made, the three physicians all signed a
death certificate stating tnat Leong Chun
Chew came to his death from edema of
the lungs. This finding was promptly i
made known to the Health Office, which
by this time was besieged by telephonic
Inquiries as to whether the bubonic plague
had broken out In Chinatown. The story
had been picked up by a few persons and
had spread with great rapidity.
While the attaches of the office were
busy answering the questions -with a
statement that no plague existed the
Chinese Consul walked in and was re
ceived by Assistant Secretary Zobel. The
Consul stated that he was anxious to Hear
the result of the autopsy, and when in
formed expressed himself as greatly re
lieved. He stated that it was his earnest
desire to have the Health Inspectors re
moved from the Chinatown district: that
he was convinced that no plague had ever
existed there and that the vague reports
had already done considerable damage to
the business of Chinatown merchants and
would do much more to the Christmas
trade if allowed to go uncontradicted.
Evidently the Chinese merchants had been
getting after the Consul to secure relief
from the threatened boycott. :'â  ', ~"\
Secretary Zobel assured the Consul that
all proper steps would undoubtedly be
taken in the direction of correcting any
erroneous impressions that might be
abroad, and the Consul expressed himself
as satisfied and withdrew.
While the Board of Health and the
newspapers of this city were taking care
of the interests of the people, as already
outlined, several irresponsible correspond
ents of Chicago and New York news
papers sent out sensational telegrams to
the effect that the bubonic plague had
broken out in San Francisco and that fif
teen Chinamen had died of the disease.
The Chicago newspapers at once issued
special editions, while the New York
sheets contented themselves with dis-
ADVERTISEMENTS.

MASCOT "BOOTS"
HOME FROM MANILA
A Little Hero From the Wars Tells a Graphic Tale of Fight
ing and "Me and Dewey/'
BOOTS" Is with us again. He first came with the Pennsylvania soldiers, sailed with them in the capacity of
mascot to Company B, and having helped them in their rush into the trenches before Manila is in hs name
Knd once moâ¢ uifsca hed and as modest a lad as when he sold papers and shines on the streets of Plttsburg.
Boo' whSe real name is Robert McDennott. is 13 years old. yet for six of these years he has made at Â£ast
iioo.s, wuubo jcax Â«Â«u hig n and fQr three years he hag been regrarded as the mas
cot of Company B. It was a habit of his to attend the yearly encampments,
and because he was so tiny and so Independent he became a favorite. \Vhen
the regiment was ordered West, the order was construed to include Boots.
The little mascot had not been here long before he attracted attention.
diminutive, and so manly. Only four feet five inches in height, he talked
like a soldier, and the blue in which he was arrayed seemed exactly to suit
Boots told something of his adventures. He had sailed with the regiment June 15, and reached Manila more than
a month later. He was "stationed at Camp Dewey, and had a vivid recollection of the terrible night attack made
on the trenches by the Spaniards.
'â¢Was I scared?" he replied indignantly. "Naw. I carried ammernltlon to the men. On the 3d of August I came
near gitting hit by a shell, and in about ten days more I marched into Manila with the rest of the men.
"I shook hands with a Spanish baby," he added gleefully, "and shook my fist at a Spanish general. He didn't
mind, though."
"Did you meet Dewey?"
The small chest heaved. "Meet Dewey: Why me and him's friends."
He told of a trip from Manila to Hongkong and back on the Olympia and the kindness of the sailors to him.
They had made him up a purse of $40, and while he was grateful, the fact of having talked with the admiral was
his pride.
So the picture of Boots is printed, and his story. It is not printed to incite anybody to send him back to his
home. The Call will attend to this.
â  playing the stuff under big black head
j lines. The correspondents In question
wen' apparently disappointed yesterday
afternoon when they called at the Health
Office and were Informed of the result of
the autopsy and examination. A choice
story for the yellow Sunday papers was
spoiled.
It should be stated that Dr. Spencer, in
order to confirm the findings made yester
day, has determined to conduct a bac
teriological examination of some of the
tissues taken from the Chinaman's re
mains, and will try to grow bacilli, using
culture ovens for the purpose. If that
Chinaman had any microbes at all in his
composition the doctor expects to find and
classify them. But he does not expect to
discover any of a harmful character.
As a result of the findings made, the
quarantine of Chinatown was declared off
yesterday afternoon.

Ex-Bank Commissioner's Domestic
TTnhappiness Will Be Aired

Before the estate of the late James T.
Murphy, the wealthy San Jose banker
and rancher, is finally distributed all the
skeletons In his family will be brought
into glaring light. He died recently, leav
ing about $250,000 worth of property, and
whether it will be apportioned ' as he
wished will be decided by the courts. He
divided the estate into two parts, Â£ivinK
half to his daughter, Mrs. Chapman, and
half to a number. of nephews and nieces.
The daughter is not satisfied with this di
vision and will sue for the whole of the
estate, claiming she is the only heir, and
that her father was unduly influenced
by his relatives to make such a dispo
sition of his property.
' There is another dissatisfied- claimant
who will also seek to break the testament
â¢with the aid of lawyers. Miss -Bertha
Smalley, at present residing in this city
with her brother, believes she has a just
claim to a portion of the property. ' The
young woman claims that she was the af

would have been wedded long ago but for

When told- of the impending lawsuits last

"If Bertha Smalley got all of Murphy's

life. He was a very hard drinker and she

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 27, 1898.
In the renewal of old friendships Boots did The Call the honor of a
visit. He might have been taken for a messenger boy, but the uniform was
of a military cut. on the left arm two crossed flags and above this emblem,
in yellow letters, the legend: "Boots. Co. B, 10 Regiment Penna. Vol." Plain
ly his credentials were strictly military. Besides he is too small to be a
messenger. He is only big enough to have gone to the Philippines, to have
marched into a conquered city, and to have shared the glory of the occa-
Boots explained that the title was only a nickname, and that his father
called him Bob. He spoke in a childish voice, but with every indication
that he knew what he was talking about. "I got a 'nonorable discharge,"
he said, "an" I ain't got enough money to git home. I'd like to have my
picture put in The Call so's the Red Cross and such folks '11 know I'm no
bum and give me a ticket home."
The request did not appear unreasonable, and Boots perceiving that he
was In a congenial atmosphere began to talk freely. He had been a passen
ger on the City of Para, and his stock of money consisted of $30. He was
stopping at the California, but realized that Pittsburg was a long way off.
He showed a formal order of discharge, given that he might go home and
to school. Colonel Hawkins had added that Boots was an intelligent and
well-behaved boy entitled to consideration from all Americans. The traveler
Is also fortified with the following letter:

HIS CARRER
IN SOCIETY
CUT SHORT
George Newstadt Ar
rested in Oakland.
TRAVELED IN SWELL CIRCLES
ENTERTAINED ROYALLY, BUT
DID NOT ALWAYS PAY.
A Host of Caterers, Livery Men, Flor
ists and Hotel-Keepers 'lYusted
Not Wisely but Too
Well.
George Newstadt, a German marine,
was arrested on Washington street, Oak
land, last night, by Detectives Hodgkins
and Shorey and turned over to Detective
Dillon of this city, who wanted him and
wanted him badly.
The news of Newstadt's arrest will be
received with mingled feelings of joy and
surplrse. Society friends will once again
be shocked and a host of creditors will
chuckle gleefully.
Newstadt arrived in this city some
months ago and managed to secure entree
to good society, and of course, made the
most of it. He at once became known as
ACTOR OSBOURNE A
NEW SANTA CLAUS
To Organize a Society for the Mu
tual Protection of Stage
Children*
/"> EORGE OSBOURNE, the veteran actor, is preparing to assume the
gratifying role of a real live Santa Claus. Osbourne's character Is to
Ãbe a thoroughly up-to-date one. No furs, no reindeer, no flowing snowy
beard â only the name of the dear old saint and his endearing charac
teristics â love for the little ones with plenty of gifts for all.
Mr. Oabourne's arrangement for the Important role which he is shortly
to assume has been patterned after the more experienced actors of Lon
don, Paris and New York. There dear Kris Krlngle Is known as the head
and front of the society of the "Children of the Stage," and he presides at
its annual Christmas entertainment and helps the members stow away un
limited good things, besides gratifying their hearts' most secret desires.
Mr. Osbourne assisted at the Christmas festival of the "Children of
the Stage" in New York last year, and the noble motive of the society so
impressed him that the actor decided to contribute his mite by assisting in
the organization of a similar society in this city. A week ago Osbourne
made the first move in the touching little game by sending out circulars to
all the local theaters and all tho actors, requesting that they send in the
names of all their stage children, and further that they request the same
children to write to Santa Claus, demanding of the sainted gentleman the
thing or things that each one most desired.
Osbourne has gone into the matter with heart and soul, and his only re
gret is that he has not enough time to devote to the noble and charitable
work. "My plan," said the actor, "Is to make the society one of mutual
advantage and protection. I want to interest the children of the rich in
the children of the stage. I should like the little ones reared amid all
that affluence can give to meet the little ones who labor so hard to please
them. I would gratefully receive the application of an eligible little girl for
president, and consider It an honor to bestow upon her that distinction.
"As in the New York society, I propose to have a Christmas entertain
ment given by the Children of the Stage. This entertainment will be held
during Christmas week at the Alcazar Theater and admission will be by
invitation only. The Christmas tree will be a feature of the affair, and
any donation for the same will be gratefully received. The growth of
the society, I expect, will at first be slow, but as the noble purpose be
comes better known I hope that the organization will increase In mem
bership and its financial resources increase proportionately. My greatest
desire is to see the Children of the Stage endow a cot at the Children's
Hospital."
All the local theatrical people have embraced enthusiastically Mr. Os
bourne's noble purpose, and with the co-operation of the social world which
will surely be forthcoming the Society of the Children of the Stage is bound
to shortly stand upon a foundation of mutual love and protection, backed
by a gratifying condition of the exchequer.
a hig-h roller, who rolled exceedingly high.
Money was apparently no object with
him, expense a thing not to be thought
of and he entertained most lavishly. So
ciety young men flocked to his side and
enjoyed his banquets and society mammas
received him with open arms, while
chaperons snowed their choicest buds and
creditors accepted his "I. O. Us."
The livery stable man, the florist, the
caterer, the hotel keeper and the proprie
tor of the fashionable cafe all fell victims
to his winning ways and empty pockets.
He never patronized anything but the
best houses, and if all reports are true,
sometimes forgot to i>ay. But he made a
good showing. His friends of both sexes
were his guests at driving parties Innu
merable; as a host the choicest viands
and rarest wines tickled the throats of his
guests and the town was ransacked for
flowers choice enough to be presented to
his friends. Only a few days ago he hired
a launch from Henry Peterson and took
a party out on the Bay. Henry's palm U
still itching for the gold which might
have been his and he has tacked up a "no
credit" sign over his desk.
The specific charge to be lodged
against Newstadt Is felony embezzle
ment. He is accused of having borrowed
a sword from an officer and attempted to
dispose of It.

of traveling. ISone of that on Sunset
Limited. A trip on that train is more
than a pleasure; it is a great novelty.
The Southern Pacific has never lost
sight of the desirability of California as
a winter residence for people in the
East, who could not endure the rigors
of Eastern climate. It has long real
ized, too, that its southern route, famil
iarly known as the Sunset route, is
without exception the most desirable
road leading into the State for travel in
cold weather. California is a long way
from the East, and many who would
otherwise be glad to spend their win
ters here stayed away rather than face
the trying ordeal of getting here.
The one thing needful, therefore, to
make the natural tie between Califor
nia and the East binding and
Indissoluble was the means of get-,
ting here with absolute ease and com
fort. This has all been solved by Sun
set Limited. That magnificent flying
palace is exactly as comfortable and
luxurious and enjoys as many conve
niences between San Francisco and
New Orleans as the finest apartments
in the finest hotel in California, and it
doesn't cost a cent more than traveling
in first class trains of other lines. You
don't have to buy daily papers or mag
azines or literature of any kind any
where en route; writing material is
supplied in abundance; the ladies have
a waiting maid in constant attendance;
gentlemen have a barber shop an"
bathroom; both luxurious parlors and
observation apartments, in which to
lounge and be sociable; and the grade
of living afforded by the exquisite din
ing car will hardly bear description for
fear of seeming exaggerated. The
severest injunction Is placed upon the
train operatives to not only be vigilant
in keeping away all annoyances to pas
sengers but even to anticipate their
wishes and pleasure and treat them as
though they were entertaining guests.
That sort of thing didn't have to con
tinue long to spread the fame of the
Limited and endear it to the heart of
every traveler, nor is it surprising to
hear many of our visitors say that they
come to California every winter as
much for the pleasure of the trip as the
visit.
It is in this way that Sunset Limited
is so closely related to California. It is
distinctly Californian. It was born
here, is a true native product, enjoys
the superior quality, enterprise and
pride of California, and has done more,
it might almost be said, than any other
single cause to spread California's glo
rious fame and endear her to all the
world.
Sunset Limited is worthy of the
patronage of all Californians. It will
leave San Francisco every Tuesday and
Saturday at 10 p. m. for New Orleans,
and connect there with through limited
trains for all narts of the South and
East.

When Lucky Baldwin Saw His $3, 000, 000 Go Up in Smoke
Eventful Life of a Mam Who 'Began With Nothing, Blundered on to a
Small Fortune, Ran It Up to Millions and Saw His Life
Work Vanish In an Hoar.
. On the night of the m '.ââ¢.-â¢â¢.Â«* i Â«Â«,"'.Vww' Ratdwln and his daughter were awakened and; dragged from the flaming rooms Just;; -'in ,time itosave> their lives.
N old man wandered disconsolate on the edg-e of the
throng. Fire cast a glow upon thousands of up-
I J turned faces. All were eagerly, fearfully watching
I^l the great building robed in flame. A shudder swept
I across the multitude when at some lofty window
# would appear a form, framed with smoke. There
would be a shout as brave men went to the rescue. A
hero was seen to save three women, helpless but for him.
Then he sought to save himself, and death reached out
of the pyre and clutched him. There were screams and sobs.
From adjacent buildings, horrifieri yet entranced, people
gazed upon a scene so terrible that ever the memory of it
shall be with them.
The old man stood for a moment as if fascinated.
About him rained the ashes of his hopes. A fiery shower
pattered and hissed in the puddles at his feet. Deeper
wrinkles came into his face. He seemed to grow visibly
aged as the awful moments passed. Was it that his mil
irons were flying on wings of flame? Was it at the thought
that when he had reared himself a towering monmnent
of lath and plaster he had made a trap and a tomb? At
last the trap had been sprung. After many years the
tomb had been seared of its paint and gilding and yawned,
heated, horrible and wide, for Its victims. With shriek
and prayer they vainly resisted.
People looked at the old man and said: "That's Bald
win." â
It was Baldwin. "Lucky" he had been called in the
days when all he touched seemed to turn to gold, when
mines and stocks rolled wealth into his lap, when his realty
doubled and trebled in value, when his horses could not
lose; and now, when his fortune has shrunk, a great mort
gage covers his possessions, the petty tradesman brings
suit, when there is no ready money and no credit and tne
Baldwin Hotel, his pride, is a blackened wreck, he will
still be known as "Lucky." The old significance Is gone.
The term is one merely of identification.
The history of E. J. Baldwin is strange, as individual
histories go, yet it is familiar to this coast, where he has
been an important figure in the financial world. He came
here without money, worked at what he could find to do,
hoarded, speculated in modest fashion and returned from
a trip to Australia to find that he was a magnate. Cer
tain stocks had been left with a broker to be disposed of
if they reached a certain price. These had been locked
in a safe, or Baldwin had forgotten to sign the order, or
at least the broker was unable to carry out the directions
o? the principal. So the stocks, remaining unsold, rose by
leaps and bounds. By the time Baldwin had them In his
hands again they were gond on the market for many times
more than the amount an avarice-tinted dream had led
him to think they might realize. Soon he was engaged
with all the fervor of an enthusiasm newly awakened in
adding to his store. He did not hesitate at risks from
which the prudent would have held back, and they all
resulted as he planned and wished. He became mighty
enough to fight Flood and O'Brien, and after one of his
notable turns could have retired with $18,000,000. This was
the top-notch in his monetary triumph.
In his mining speculations Baldwin was never ham
pered by conscience. With a given object in view noth
ing could swerve him. There were ugly stories of the
way in which he and his associates manipulated the stocks
SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 27, 1898.
into which eager imitators, inspired by his glittering suc
cess, had poured their meager savings. Perhaps these
stories were true. Similar tales have been true in every
great excitement which has brought riches to the few and
penury to the many.
A climax had to be reached. Baldwin got out of the
Comstock in time, and the accumulations were invested
in various channels, all remunerative. He bought the
ground where until a few days ago the Baldwin Hotel
reared itself, a huge tinder box built on graceful lines.
The site was far from the center of the city then. Friends
told Baldwin he was crazy, but he was shrewd; he seemed
to have read the future, and he laughed at their counsel.
The city came to the hotel, then went far beyond, until
to-day the site Is practically the center of San Francisco,
and by all odds the most valuable piece of realty within
its bounds. The owner took much satisfaction in the hotel
and the theater It contained. He was vain enough to give
his name to both. He had an almost childish fancy for
bedecking their interiors with gaudy ornamentation. The
rotunda of the hotel was bright with color, and swinging
lamps of censor shape lighted it through strangely tinted
glass. There was an abundance of variegated marble.
The doors were heavily paneled so as to give the aspect
of being weighted with jewels. The entire cos^t to Baldwin
was $3,000,000. But even at so recent a date as 1873 archi
tecture was far from its present state of advancement.
The stately structure was shoddy. From basement to the
topmost .rafter it was an invitation to fire. All this defect
was covered, but it was known. The Baldwin Hotel was
as dangerously inflammable as a Chinese laundry, which
is considered so great a risk that no company will insure it.
â¢ â¢ *
It was two days after the fire. Some of the dead had
been removed. The tottering walls still stood, a menace,
the gigantic plaything of any chance breeze. Curious
crowds gazed, regardless of their peril, and the police had
to drive them back. From the chaos inside, the riot of
broken and blackened timber, the twisted pipes, the piles
of brick, nothing had been taken. The secrets held in the
depths of this unspeakable confusion were well held. Now
and then a sullen haze of smoke would curl upward from
the chasm into which one could look through breached
masonry, or with resounding clatter a loosened pillar would
be hurled from the swaying heights. Murky water was
being drawn from the Grotto where the merriment had
been wont to reign.
Mr. Baldwin had gone home. His ample house on
California street is comfortable and luxurious. There he
was found in the evening with- his daughters. Was he
downcast? Not in the least. The past he ignored, and
the future he faced as determined and unflinching as years
ago he had faced the directors of a bank and at the point
of a pistol compelled them to his will.
"I am tired," he said, "not disheartened. It was a
shock, of course, and I have been around trying to find
some personal property. I feel all right to-night and only
need a little rest."
"TeÃ, dad," said the younger daughter, "you must be
tired," and he answered her with a caress.
"You know," he went on, "that we had a narrow es
cape ourselves. Familiar as we were with the place and
bo near the ground, we could hardly find our way. That
was the fault of the firemen. So far as everything else
was concerned they did noble work, but they made a mis
take In turning off the electric lights. If this had not been
done I do not believe there would have been a fatality.
People were naturally confused, and in the darkness they
were helpless."
On this phase of the subject Mr. Baldwin was positive,
nor would he assent to the suggestion that some exigency
of the fire itself had extinguished the lights.
"They say," continued he, "that this fire has ruined
me financially, but they are entirely mistaken. I have
already had offers of all the backing necessary. That cor
ner is not only the best piece of property in the city, but
the best in the world. This Philippine annexation will
cause it to double in value. I could sell the corner for
enough to clear oft! every mortgage on anything I own.
Then I could go to my ranch and take life easy."
He paused a moment and thought. "But I do not care
to take life easy," he resumed. '"I want to see go up at
that corner a splendid hotel. It shall be the finest that
money can build." His eye kindled at the idea. "It shall
be eight stories high, all steel and iron, no wood except
the doors and window frames. There will be a great
arcade running from Market to Ellis, with a magnificent
rotunda. The cafe will seat 1500 people and the profit from
that alone would be $200,000 a year. The lease on the hotel
that burned had two years longer to run and then I had
expected to clear from the hotel at least $175,000 a year."
Here were vast plans, in the mind of a man who had
lived of years three score an 4 ten, whose life had been
marked by struggle and by triumph! and upon whose
whitened locks adversity had fallen, yet who was not dis
mayed. He struck the observer as a wonderful old man,
one who stood in the twilight and still felt the impulses
born of the morning sun. Ambition is as of yore,
hope seems as radiant. Without a tremor he faces the
future as though it stretched before him an indefinite
vista, each season certain to be crowned with the fruits
of endeavor. He had no word of repining for the loss, in
deed refused to regard it as a discouragement. And if deep
in his heart there was a pang that the house he had
erected to be his monument should have caused the death
of the innocent, he made no sign; no, the turning out ct
the light had been the cause, and the firemen had done
this. No word of the tortuous passages in which the de
spairing had groped, the lath and piaster which environed
them until it burst into blazing.
* â¢ â¢
As to the financial standh.ar of E. J. Baldwin now
I' ere are few who know and they are not of a communi
cative sort. For years he has been hard pressed. !f one
could judge by the suits filed against him, the mortgages
held by moneyed institutions, the pledging of chattels.
There Is a mortgage on the Baldwin site, on the great
Santa Anita ranch. There are judgments unsatisfied,
liens, actions pending and threatened. Either Baldwin
has been without money, or with the obstinacy which is
characteristic of him, he enjoys litigation more than he
does- the paying of debts.
As to the personal reputation of the man, charity might
pass it by. He has not been used to respond to the call
of need. He has never been regarded as generous. When
he has spent coin freely it has been in some scheme of
gain or aggrandizement. The gain has dwindled, the ag
grandizement never became more than notoriety. The
association of Baldwin with women has been a series of
shameful scandals. This more than any other one thing
has made him virtually friendless.
He was shot at in open court by the sister of one girl
he had wronged, and the only comment was in the form
of expressions of regret that the bullet missed. He has
sworn that his own reputation w.as so unholy and so well
understood that none led astray by his blandishments had
a right to set up the plea of deception, because he had
lost power to deceive. His pride has not extended^ to the
safeguarding of his own name. According to the ethics
of society he is an outlaw whom none of the other sex
may meet without reproach. The doors of respectability
have long been closed to him. He has never cared. Thus
he may account, if the matter occur to him, for the ab
sence of sympathy. If aid be extended it will be solely
on a business basis.
* â¢ *
There is the crash of falling beams. The smoked and
blistered remnant of the Baldwin is coming to earth.
Upon the stage where tragedy and comedy thrilled and
amused the debris is piling high. From the pitiful wreck
will come scarcely enough plunder to tempt the junkman.
And to another, a man not equipped with the dauntless
nerve which has marked Baldwin's career, the wreck of
the owner would be as complete as the ruin of the property.18
EX-QUEEN LILIUOKALANI`S LAST STRUGGLE: To Get Possesion of the Crown Lands of Hawaii
THEY`RE WORTH $7,000,000
THE most pathetically dignified
â¢woman in all America, she
sits crownless, scepterless and
regal. In the plainly fur
nished room to which she brings
an atmosphere of fallen gran
deur. She has lost her scepter, crown
and lands, but she has inherited that
from her blue-blooded ancestors of
which no republic could rob her. Self
respect clothes her as with a garment.
No note of complaint can be detected in
thf> well-chosen, musically toned Eng
lish phrases that fall from her lips.
Albeit surrounded by a small circle of
ardent sympathizers, to whom her con
fidences would be sacred, she has no
bitter word for those who have so
cruelly injured her. Even of the suf
fering American soldiery thrust upon
her fair land she only speaks with the
tender pity of a great heart. She has
gone through the training school of.
Buffering to learn the divine lesson of
forgiveness and looks upon the harsh
present with the large-eyed glance of
one who has a glorious past to gaze
upon. It is that past which invests her
with her sanctity of fallen grandeur;
its ghosts hang around her with an in
tangible glory. They place an invisible
crown upon her brow, they drape an
invisible mantle of royalty upon her
shoulders, and her small brown hand
still closes on an invisible scepter of
which death alone shall rob her. Calm,
stately and retrospective, in a little
ro< m of a big San Francisco hotel, she
recalls a noble chatelaine of, the old re
gime, unshaken by the tumult of the
Reign of Terror, with naught but higl
born pity on her persecutors.
But behind the chatelaine the woma
shelters; and the crushed, insulted wo
man, keenly alive to personal sympa
thy, reveals herself in the sudden
dimmed eyes, in the mobile, quiverin
. lips, as her plight tapering hand
kissed with that reverence which
more instinctive toward royalty falle
than royalty triumphant.

According to the Court Jeweler, pub
lished in Germany, the crown that
adorned Queen Wllhelmina of Holland
on her coronation, and which was once
stolen and regained, is valued at 1600 -
â  000.
This is not the only crown that has
had an adventure. Prince Drago
grandnephew of Isabelle, former Queen
of Spain, visited America a few years
ago for the purpose of regaining the
crown the Queen had disposed of.
Much to his chagrin, he found that it
had been bought up as a valuable addi
tion to the jewels of the Countess de
CaptPllane. daughter of the late Jay
Gould. The price paid for it was $125 -
000.
Queen Victoria's crown Is set with
2500 diamonds, 233 pearls and a most
extraordinary ruby. The crown is val
ued at $1,600,000.
The crown of Portugal is said to be
worth $6,200,000.
The crown worn by the Emperor of
Austria was made 800 years ago for
Stephan TI. King of Hungary. It
weighs fourteen pounds, has flfty
three sapphires, fifty rubies, one

of rebel guns. General Tomas
Regalado, commander in chief of
the rebel forces, has proclaimed
himself conqueror.
His adversaries are plentiful and
powerful.
There Is Gutierrez, President of Sal
vador and commander of the official
army.
There Is Carlos Melendez, one of the
richest and most powerful men in Sal
vador.
There Is Horacio Villavicencio, Gov
ernor of San Miguel and sworn enemy
of Regalado.
And above all there is the concen
trated power of the new United States
of Central America.
Against these forces stands Tomas
Regalado with his allies. To-day he is
master of the situation.
Yesterday he was but the puppet of !
Gutierrez.
To-morrow, Quien sabe?
For though the rebel forces are now]
in control, the opposition haa not yet i

made the full measure of its strength
felt. Nicaragua and Honduras have
sent 8000 men, well armed, but as yet
they have not reached Salvador. Mod
ern methods of transporting troops are
not available there, and the progress of
the unmounted troops is of necessity
dangerous]}- slow.
Gutierrez, Melendez and Villavicen
cio have combined, but so far Regalado
has been able to crush their concerted
efforts.
They have money, official power, the
regular army and ammunition.
But Regalado has Santa Ana. The
men of Santa Ana boast that they make
and unmake presidents. They are' men
of might and muscle. When Santa Ana
declares itself for a certain candidate
his election is assured, for in Central
America political problems are gener
ally settled by a revolution. And San
ta Ana warriors are the bravest and
boldest. Regalado is himself a native
of Santa Ana; therefore to a man. Santa
Ana is fighting for Regalado.
Regalado and his forces claim that the
object of their movement is the over
throw of the Federal Republic, which
was organized November 1 last.
The United States of Central America
was formed of Nicaragua, Salvador
and Honduras. (
EX-QUEEN LILIUOKALy\JMI.
From a rccont photograph.
This changed the aspect of the De
cember elections. The candidates who
were aspiring for the Presidency of
Salvador were forced to seek the Gov
ernorship instead. Salvador by the
new treaty was but a State in the
Union.
There were three candidates for the
coveted position. Gutierrez, the incum
bent, declared that he had no desire
to serve another term.
Of the three desiring the office Melen..
dez was by far the most popular. He
had the support of rich and poor alike.
He had proven that he had the coun
try's good at heart when in 1889 he ne
gotiated a loan with England and re
fused to accept the proffered commis
sion. Until he entered the race the
chances looked about equal between
Regalado and Villavicencio, the two
other candidates.
Regalado, it was believed, had the
secret support of Gutierrez.
Villavicencio, as Governor of San Mi
guel, had a strong following.
But when Melendez consented to run
it was generally conceded that he would
not- have the slightest difficulty in de
feating the other candidates.
Villavicencio and Regalado became
threatening. Their resignations, the
one as Governor and the other as in
spector of the army, were officially de
manded.
But Regalado's resignation was
printed in the official paper with flat
tering comments on the character and
ability of the man. This was in keep
ing with the marked preference Gutier
rez has always shown Regalado. And
Regalado showed his appreciation by
starting a revolution.
Then for the first time Gutierrez took
a stand against him. For Regalado,
stone deaf and a heavy drinker, had
heretofore been a prime favorite. Gu
tierrez forgave him his misdemeanors
and cherished an affection toward him
strange and unchangeable. Some said
it was because Regalado suffered exile
with Gutierrez after his first attempt
against the rule of the Ezetas. The man
who shared the ill fortune of Gutierrez
was given the lion's share when for
tune favored him.
Others said Gutierrez countenanced
the vagaries of Regalado because he
was "flojo" (weak).
Regalado was the commander in
chief of the army. While on a drunken
bout some of his intoxicated henchmen
questioned his power.
"I will show you." said Regalado. He
led them to the fort.
"Who goes?" called the sentry.
"Regatado and his followers."
"Regalado can enter. The others re
main outside."
So his companions waited while Rega
lado entered the fort.
"Do you know who I am?" he asked
the general in command.
"Certainly, sir."
"Do you recognize my authority?"
"Certainly, sir," again responded the
general.
"Will you do my bidding?"
"Certainly, sir."
"Then," said Regalado, "I declare
myself President. Release the fort to
me."
"But that is unlawful. I " Rega
lado slid into a chair, and then the gen
eral saw that the self-proclaimed
President had been drinking.
The conscientious general telephoned
Regalado's treacherous proposal to Gu
tierrez.
"He must be drunk," said Gutierrez.
"He is," responded the general.
"Fix him up a soft bed and let him
sleep it off," commanded Gutierrez.
"Flojo," said the people of Salvador
when they heard it.
Regalado furnished arms to Castillo
in the Guatemalan trouble. This was
in direct violation of the treaty of neu
trality. Gutierrez was forced to dis
charge Regaiado, but he immediately
gave him another position.
"Flojo," again said the people of Sal
vador.
Regalado was forced to resign from
this position because of hia attitude
during the political campaign. But the
resignation was officially printed with
flattering encomiums.
"Flojo," said Salvador.
, But wfcien baffled in his political as
pirations Regalado took up arms. Then
at last Gutierrez proved that he could
be oiher than "fio-jo."
He* has rallied the forces and is de
termined to put down Regalado. Carlos
Melendez and Villavlcencio are aiding
him and the forces from the other
States in the union are daily expected.
But at present Regalado, with Santa
Ana as his stronghold, is master of the
situation.
What will to-morrow bring forth in
this turbulent country? Quien sabe?

NOW come the United States of
Central America, a nation which
has arisen out of mucn revolu
tion. It is composed of Nica
ragua, Salvador and Hcyidurae,
which have at various times done a
little fighting together and against each
other. The seat of Government was
moved last week from Amapola, the
temporary capital, to Chinandega, in
Nicaragua. A constitution, which is

was adopted early this month. So the
new nation, pocketed between Guate

unambitious, easy-going natives, too

these that a foreign soldiery must ba

For the Hawaiian of to-day is poor,
very poor, sometimes hard-pressed for
food. *'But you know what my people

lack everything, they still smile and

"But what has caused this Increase

"Not at all; it is the result of Immi

Indeed, there is little left for the Ha

There is a puzzling reserve In Liliuo

tion is speedily vouchsafed by one
present, whose heart rises to his lips, a,
speaker with the authority of experi

"There is another reason that your
Majesty perhaps purposely omits," ho
comments â "the political. A native who
is known to have national or monarch
ical sympathies, one who has not taken
the oath of allegiance, is denied work
on every pretext; he is practically sub
jected to petty persecution; everything
is done to deprive him of a means of
livelihood and to harm him and those
belonging to him. Your Majesty can
corroborate what I assert?"
A hot flush rises to the dark cheek.
"I can say more," comes the swift an
*wer. "If I, taking the oath of allegi
ance, strive to help some friend who
has not taken it, I shall be made to
suffer for his omission. We may not
even choose our affections."
"And in spite of this how many na
tives have taken it?"
"Very few," the words ring proudly
and sadly through the room; "from two
to three thousand at the outside."
"And for the rest, there are no longer
rich chiefs to depend upon; the pa
triarchal life is done away with?"
"There are few chiefs left and no pa
triarchal life."
The small brown hand closes sud
denly as with nervous tension. Liliuo
kalani is thinking of her people, whom
she can no longer help; of the broad
lands inherited fo>m a long-lined an
cestry and held in fief for the good of
the people. On those lands the sugar
cane waves, the fragrant white coffee
flower blossoms and the produce there
of weights the pockets of white rulers
who "knew not Joseph."
And with the lands has ffone the flag.
"Our flag," says Liliuokaltuii; "our
fl a g_ t hat was pulled down. The Ha
waiian Ladies' Patriotic Society wrote
to Admiral Miller asking, to be allowed
its possession. He never answered."
Yet another flag has fallen into un
loving hands. In a Washington draw
ing-room the unfortunate Queen had
the royal standard triumphantly point
ed out to her by its girl owner.
"How on earth did it get there?"
protests the indignant adherent who
has already spoken. "By what right
does Miss Berry hold it?"
"I cannot say. You are aware that
I received orders to collect and send the
rlags. They were to be burned. This
one "was not burned, and apparently
Miss Berry was deemed worthy to pos
sess it."
"And was it the particular flag
worked by ?"
The Queen interrupts with quiet
dignity, but her voice trembles:
"I do not know. I was shown the
flag. I did not look at it."
There are women â and they may be
Queens â who glorify their sex. There
are othersâ and they may be citizen
esses â who forswear their crown of
womanhood. But there be men of
kindlier nature, and Lilioukalanl still
cherishes the memory of Robert Louis
Stevenson's tender sympathy. "We
sat without speaking," she tells in al
lusion to their last interview. "At
last I said, 'We have been making his
tory, you and I.' He pressed my hand
and our eyes met."
Would that those eyes could meet
again! Would that Stevenson's fervid
pen could be enlisted on behalf of the
woman who is now on her way to
Washington seeking redress and justice
for herself, and, through her, for those
she pines to help. For Liliuokalani's
object in going to Washington is an
open secret of which she alone denies
knowledge.
"The papers know all about It," she
Bays carelessly; "the papers know all
about my business. I have nothing to
"But you can trust to the generosity
of the American nation?"
The mobile mouth twitches slightly,
then a quiet laugh comes:
"On that point I have no opinion at
all to offer."
As I leave her in her calm gracious
ness with her soft voice, sweet, dark
face and rippling gray hair, I pray that
this land may at last tender lustice and
reverence to one whom it has used so
harshly. A. R. ROSE-SOLEY.

Special Correspondence of the Sunday Call
WILMINGTON, N. C. Nov. 19.
âThe Governor of South
Carolina, he says to the
Governor of North Caro
lina, "It's a long time be
tween lynchings": and the Governor of
North Carolina, he says to the Gover
nor of Sou h Carolina, "Sh-h! Don't
talk to me about lynchings. Golly!
Don't you know they came near lynch
ing me the other night?"
Thus in allegory they are telling
through this Southern country of an in
cident in the race war of last week
which somehow did not get into the
papers, but came very near furnishing j
a.s big a sensation as North Carolina j
ever had in its history. So far as re
called no Governor of a State in this
..country has ever lost his life at the
hands of indignant citizens of his com
monwealth.
But Governor Daniel L. Russell of
North Carolina came very near suffer
ing it from mob rule when the excite
ment was at its luight and while the
streets o' Wilmington were literally
running with blood.
Governor Russell began his political
career as a leader in this section of the
He organized the colored Re
publicans in Wilmington, and more
than any other one man is responsible
for the ascendency of the African over
the white man in the Cape Fear region.
So when the negi >es were shooting at
the white citizens and the white citi
zens were actually potting the negroes
by dozens with Winchesters, Spring
fields and shotguns, the Governor, who
was in this section of North Carolina,
hearing of the trouble, started for
home.
M LYNCH THE GOVERNOR."
He first intended going by way of
Goldsboro. Learning that there was a
mob of several hundred men at Go'.ds
boro waiting to give him a reception,
and knowing that at that period of
excitement he was a marked man, he
changed his route and went via Max
ton. Word got to Maxton ahead of the
Governor that he was going that way,
and when the train arrived a swearing,
howling mob of "red shirts," heavily
armed and ready for almost anything,
was awaiting him.
They invaded the car, threatened the
Governor and actually offered him vio
lence. The crowd was increasing and
there were cries of "Lynch him:" when
the Governor and one of his friends
hustled out of the car into a box car,
which was locked behind him, and the
conductor and his friends stood guard
until the train pulled out.
Governor Russell reached his home, in
Raleigh, over the Seaboard Air Line,
very badly frightened, and the Govern
or's friend did not have a button on
his coat and his raiment was in tat
ters. The Governor weighs more than
300 pounds and his frustrated enemies
at Maxton are still speculating as to
the figure he would have cut at the
end of a rope.
This is only one incident of the many
â¢ exciting events that have stirred the
two Carolinas during the last ten days.
There has been a great political riot
and a wholesale massacre of negroes in
Wilmington, N. C. There has been a
great political riot and a wholesale
sacre of negroes in Greenwood, S.
:C. ThÂ»- story of Wilmington and the
story of Greenwood both furnish food
for thought, but on 'tr different lines.
THP WILMINGTON RIOT.
At Wilmington at least fifteen ne
groes were killed,- but no white man
lost his life. At Greenwood at least
â¬-ight negroes were killed and one white
man lost his !if<'.
I will first teil the story of Wilming
ton and then of Greenwood, and lot the
"impartial reader draw his own conclu
sions and make his own comparisons.
The Wilmington riot was due entirely
â to th<- negro attaining supremacy in lo
cal politics. North Carolina Is about
Th>- "nly Southern State in which the
negro has practically without restric
tion exercised the right of .-tuffrage. The
negroes have b< en permitted to do this
..because they were in the minority.

State and about 100,000 colored voters.
Only in recent years did the danger of

threatening. Tri 1898, whf-n a combina
tion Of the black and white Republi
. cans and th< Populists mad" Russell
Â;nvnrnor by an enormous majority, the
white voters, and especially the Demo
cratic white voters, began to have their
apprehensions.
Governor Russell hails from the sec
tion of the State in which Wilmington
ils situated. Here the ratio of colored
men to. white is almost two to one. The
Governor and his Republican allies got
: hold of the government of the city of
Wilmington, and in order to keep the
'..negroes solid permitted them to share
in the offices. The colored men here
quickly felt their power. They realized
that it was through their votes that
the Republicans had triumphed. While
the Republican leaders held the more
â¢ important offices the white men in
: Wilmington soon found that they had
â¢ over them a colored police force, while
â¢the fire department largely consisted of
colored men and the postoffice was
. manned with colored letter-carriers.
A NEGRO GOVERNMENT.
In fact to all intents and purposes, it
was a colored city government. The
colored city government levied the
city taxes, collected them and spent]
them The whites were paying 96Mi
per cent of the taxes, the colored were
paving 3Va per cent of the taxes.
Following the induction into office of
this new regime came a repetition or
the old story of profligacy and an abuse
erf power. Nearly every Southern city
in the days of reconstruction had been
through it, and now it was Wilming
ton's turn. The colored men did not
make good policemen. They neglected
their posts and robberies multiplied.
Women were insulted on the street and
there was no redress. White women
would be jostled from the sidewalks
into the muddy streets by â¢lored
women and negro men would laugh at
them. Little white girls would have
their hats snatched and thrown into
the roadway and assaults of negroes
upon whites were of constant occur
rence. Property was insecure and in
surance rates advanced. âÂ«!Â«,,,
Even Mr. Chadbourn, the Republican
Postmaster, wrote and published a let
ter in which he declared that the ne
groes were in charge of the municipal
government of Wilmington; that the
whites would not longer ar *ith thib
condition of affairs, and that they
would carry the next election either
with votes or with arms.
Long before the canvass in the cam
paign just closed began the white citi
zens of Wilmington, almost without re
gard to party, prepared for the great
Ist emergency. Six months ago they
be?an to arm themselves quietly. Each
white citizen not affiliated with the Re
publican reign, if he did not already
have a serviceable firearm, purchased
a Winchester or a Springfield rifle and
lots of ammunition. They determined
to carry the fall election by force and
intimidation if they could not carry it
any other way.
GOVERNOR RUSSELL ALARMED.
They made no concealment of thiÂ£;
determination before the election; they
make no concealment of it now. They
were firmly convinced that the African
was not born to rule the white man.
and no amount of argument can change |
tl \ e ; lovernolrÂ°Russell1 overno l rÂ°Russell became alarmed at
the threatening condition of affairs that
his management had brought about.
He was notified that something dread
ful would happen in Wilmington if the
negroes attempted to outvote the
whites on election clay, and through his
influence the Republican leader 8 were
forced lust before the election, to take
down their ticket and give the Demo
crats no opposition in the- county ex
cept one Representative in Congress and
State Senator, these districts including
other counties than New Hanover, in
which Wilmington is situated.
Election day passed off quietly in
Wilmmgton, although in three or four
other counties in the State the negroes
were SSKildated and hindered from
voting by the presence of armed men at
th TheÂ°ei e ction 'eing over the whites de
termined to put out of office the entire
o?tâ¢ government, by force if necessary.
The Governor tried to induce the city
officials to resign, but without avail.
Then an orderly meeting of the white
citizens was called, and resolutions
were passed taking possession of the
city government in the interest of the
white population, calling on Alexander
Manly the colored editor of the Repub
lican paper, to leave town, and appoint
ing a committee to wait on the more
objectionable white officeholders and
colored leaders and invite them to leave
the county.
WHITE NAN KILLED FIRST.
The story of the exciting events that
full-, wed this revolution have already
been told. Manly, the colored editor,
who had been an object of loathing for
month? because of the editorial attack
ing white women, had already taken his
departure. The Record office was
burned, because the proprietors of the
paper were believed by the committee
appointed at the mass meeting to be ig
noring its demand.
An outbreak on the part of the ne
ernes hnd been expected that day, and
nearly every white man in the city of
Wilmington was under arms. This
number has been estimated at 2000. The
white citizens f >f each block had a dis
tinct organization undrr a separate
leader. TCach man had his orders, and
no matter where disorder broke out the
white citizens were prepared to quell
it quickly or add to It materially.
There is no question ihnt the first
shooting was done by thÂ° black men.
A negro in Brooklyn, a suburb, phot a
white man through the tight arm. The
wounded man with his left hnnd shot
the npgm dead. The negroes began to
rally in force with guns, and four of
them were shot dead in their tracks
then and there. The blacks were over
awed but not before at least fifteen
had been killed and probably twice as
many wounded. One negro was found
badly wounded hiding beneath a porcn
and was taken to the hospital.
It was a rei^n of terror simply for
the blacks and their white associates.
A REIGN OF TERROR.
A committee moved quickly around
and notified the more prominent and
objectionable white Republicans that
they must leave town. Silas P. Wright,
the Mayor, had already gone. Justice
of the "Peace Bunting, who was also
United States Commissioner, was told
to go' So were Chief of Police Melton
and Charles Gilbert, the superintendent
of city carts. Notice was also served
on G. Z. French. Mr. French is th*
acting, sheriff. He allowed the actual
Sheriff $1200 salary, and performed all
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 27, 1898,
the duties of the office himself and took
all the emoluments.
Pictures of Bunting and his colored |
housekeeper still hang on a tree in
front of his house, where they were
hung by the mob. Thomas Miller, a
noted colored leader, who, when he
heard the Record building had been
burned, declared that he would wash
his hands in white men's blood that
night, was lodged in jail, and a picket
was thrown around to prevent the
more irresponsible whites from drag
ging him forth and killing him.
Colonel Waddell, one of the most
prjminent citizens, who had been chair
man of the mass meeting, was elected
Mayor, and all the old officials resigned
under pressure. Waddell has a fighter's
jaw. His ancestors have fought in three
\> ars.
Dr. Silas P. Wright offered his resig
nation as Mayor of the city, and it was
accepted. Colonel A. M. Waddell was
elected Mayor of the city and sworn in
by M. Newman, J. P., 'whereupon Mr.
Wad Jell took his seat as Mayor.
Nearly all of the old city officials aro
now in Washington seeking to have a
Congressional investigation or aro wan
dering northward seeking new places
of abode.
The statement telegraphed North that
ministers of the Gospel, with rifles on
their shoulders, paraded the streets on
Thursday and Friday nights to pre
serve order is no fiction. This actually
took place. It is also a fact that the
race question in Wilmington rose above
politics, and that many white men
heretofore Republicans joined in over
turning the city government.
The fury of the mob at Wilmington
when it finally burst forth was added to
by race prejudice, long kept in restraint
in North Carolina. The deepest blot on
the city is that the poor whites wan
tonly shot any negroes they met. Most
of the murdered victims were unarmed
and molesting no one.
So high did the feeling in Wilming
ton run during the political campaign
that it is a marvel that there was not
a murderous outbreak long before
Thursday, November 10.
Early in the campaign Governor Rus
sell became a target far the orators
of the white men's party. The Gov
ernor owns a large plantation on the
other side of Cape Fear River, just op
posite Wilmington. For years he has
supplied the city with milk. Some one
printed a communication in the Mes
senger one day inquiring why white
men bought Governor Russell's milk,
since he was responsible for negro rule
in the city.
Instantly the Governor's dairy was
boycotted and his milk is not now sold
in the city.
So much for the story of the riot in
Wilmington. Now for the story of
Greenwood.
THE OREENWOOD RIOT.
Greenwood County in South Carolina
is a omparatively new county, having
been erected from the county of Edge
field on one side and Abbeville on the
other. Edgefield County was the scene
of some of the most disastrous political
riots" during the period of reconstruc
tion. Within its borders occurred the
famous "Ned" Tennant riot, so called
for the negro leader, who was killed.
The colored population in that sec
tion is very large, outnumbering the
whites, but the race question there is
merely a social problem, not a political
one.
In Greenwood County the qualified
white voters outnumber the qualified
negro voters about ten to one. The au
thority for this statement is Senator |
Tillman. The Tolberts are a very influ
ential white family in Greenwood
County. The most conspicuous member
of it is Major John R. Tolbert. He is
really the Republican leader in South
Carolina.
Major Tolbert is a man of middle
age, who graduated from the South
Carolina University, which at the time
of his graduation was the educational
institution of the highest standing
in the South Major Tolbert served
during the war as a member of
Butler's Confederate Cavalry Divis
ion, and came out with a fine repu
tation for courage and the rank of a
lieutenant. He is to-day a slender,
erect, dressy man, with an iron gray
beard and fine presence. He has two
brothers, one of whom, Thomas Tol
bert, lives near Phoenix.
THE TOBERTS.
Major Tolbert has a number of sons,
among whom are Robert and Rhett
Tolbert, Thomas Tolbert Jr., Joseph
Tolbert and James W.^ Tolbert. Major
Tolbert became a Republican leader in
South Carolina. He turned Republican
during reconstruction days, in the hope
of getting office. He is at present the
Collector of the Port at Charleston, S.C.,
having secured that post by virtue of
his efforts for McKinley at St. Louis in
1896. His son, Robert Rhett Tolbert, is
chairman of the Republican State
Committee. Robert Rhett Tolbert's
name has been invariably printed
Robert "Red" Tolbert. "Red" is a
nickname. His other sons are all ac
tive Republicans. The Tolberts are all
planters in that section of the State.
There are all very well educated and
very well-to-do, too, and their com
bined holdings in land exceed 10,000
acres.
The wife of James W. Tolbert was
appointed postmistress of McCor
mick, a small country town. James W.
Tolbert professes to be his wife's as
sistant in the office. Collins, a brother
in-law of R. R. Tolbert, claims to be
the postmaster of Ninety-Six, a station
on the Southern Railway, near Green
wood. This is denied by the Demo
crats, who say that Collins is an ap
plicant for the poHtoffice at Abbleville
Courthouse, and James Tolbert is an
applicant for the postoffice at Green
wood.
Although the Tolberts are one of the
best families in the State, there being
nothing against either their personal or
business habits, the great mass of
white people have regarded them with
enmity because they are Republicans.
When Robert Rhett Tolbert became a
candidate for Congress this fall the
white Democrats declared that he
should not have any votes, and the feel
ing in the community was very bitter.
NEGRO VOTES REFUSED.
The negroes were bolder than they
have been for many years. I do not
think the Tolberts have anything to do
with this. The only reasonable explan
ation I have got is that furnished by
Colonel N. G. Gonzales, who says that
since the colored troops behaved so fine
ly at Santiago and El Caney the ne
groes through the South believe that
they are a race of warriors and can
whip the white men, and this impres
sion has made them very hard to get
along with. ; _ .^
They were encouraged by the orators
both in North and South Carolina to go
to the polls on election day, and were
reminded of the great exploits of their
race in Cuba. The colored orators were
prone to allude to Maceo as one of the
greatest warriors of modern times.
Election day came and all the negroes
of Greenwood County who were quali
fied to vote through coming up to the
requirement of the South Carolina con
stitution were told by the Tolberts to
go to the polls and vote for Robert
Rhett Tolhert for Congress. Phoenix,
which was one of the polling places,
consists of a cross roads country store.
It was here that the race war in South
Carolina began.
The polling place was on the second
floor. Every time a negro applied to
vote for Robert Rhc't Tolbert his vote
was refused, whether he owned $300 and
could read and write or not.
Thomas Tolbert Jr. was in charge of
the negroes at this polling place. He
asked permission to take the affidavits
of the negroes that they were qualified
voters and were not allowed to vote. In
the room where the ballot boxes were
this was refused, so he went down
stairs, had blanks filled out in regular
form, signed and acknowledged by a
notary public. As each affidavit was
made It was folded and put into a bal
lot box which the Republicans had pro
vided.
This went on for some time until J.
I. Etheridge, a prominent white man in
the community, tried to stop the pro
ceedings. As a matter of fact Mr.
Etheridge had no more rieht to inter
fere than if he lived in another State.
There was no danger of negro supre
macy; there was no danger of the Dem
ocratic candidate for Congress being
unseated, because the contest could not
possibly amount to anything, and in ad
dition to this, Phoenix was not in Mr.
Etheridge's voting place.
Mr. Etheridge's interference resulted
in a fight, and during this fight Mr.
Etheridge was shot and died almost in
stantly.
THE WHITES TO ARMS.
Then the whites flew to arms. A
Tolbert and negro hunt began, which
lasted for three days. Most of the ne
groes took to the woods and were hard
to find.
At the close of the second day's riot
ing some negroes fired upon a party of
whites from ambush at Plney Grove
Church, wounding two of them. Armed
white men scoured the country in every
direction.
The fury of the mob was directed
more especially toward the Tolberts.
Thomas Tolbert had been shot and
mortally wounded in the fight at the
polling place. Major John R. Tolbert
was driving along the road with his
15-year-old nephew when the whites
fired on him. He was shot in the back
with buckshot and in the head with
bird shot. His nephew was also wound
ed with buckshot. Some of the promi
nent Democrats assisted the elder Tol
bert to a place of safety, but later,
when the rioters learned his where
abouts, they went to the house deter
mined to kill him.
He made his escape, however, and
reached Columbia, three days after he
had been shot, with none of the forty
six leaden pellets that had entered his
flesh yet removed. The other Tolberts
and the whites who had been connected
with them In the movement got out of
the county as best they could.
The only Tolberts who remained were
Thomas, senior, and Elias L., the
brothers of John R. Tolbert. Thomas,
senior, had remained in Abbeville and
was not molested. The mob pursued
Ellas L. Tolbert to the house of a
prominent Democrat, but was finally
persuaded to disperse. Since that time
Ellas L. Tolbert has printed a most ab
ject letter, in which he alludes to his
! brave war record in the Confederate
' army, states that he never joined in
' the movement to have the negroes vote
i and pledges all his efforts in the fu
j ture for the sustaining of white su
| premacy in South Carolina.
In the meantime the negro hunt went
on, the Tolbert hunt having been aban-
I doned. Wherever a negro was found
I he was shot down.
It is doubtful if any of the men who
' had a hand in the shooting; of Etheridge
have been killed. Nearly all of those
who were slain were not only inno-
I cent of participating in the earlier trou
ble and of firing on the whites at Piney
; Grove Church, but were unarmed.
I When a negro was found no questions
j were asked. He had merely to run and
i the mob riddled his back with buck
; shot and bullets. At one place by the
I roads there was a pile of five dead ne
| groes as late as Thursday afternoon.
While the excitement was at its
; height a movement was started to burn
the houses of the Tolberts. Wiser coun
! sel prevailed and this was not done.
Both Governor Ellerbe and Senator
I Tillman are in favor of shooting colored
i men in order to keep them in subjee
1 tion. Tillman himself participated in
the great Hamburg riot in 1886. In
- speaking of the Governor's conduct a
i Greenville paper said that the Governor
i on Tuesday, when there was rioting at
I the polls, remained calm, and that on
i Wednesday, when white men were

CYCLIST IN AFRICA
CHASED BY A LION
THE following is. says the British
Central Africa Gazette of Septem
ber 10, perhaps one of the most
extraordinary adventures that has
ever fallen to the lot of a European
even in Central Africa, where adven
tures with wild beasts are pretty fre
quent:
Mr. D. C. Robertson, Gala Estate,
Namazi, about midway between Blan
tyre and Zobra, sends the following
note:
"I rode out on my bicycle from Blan
tyre on Monday afternoon, the 2?a of
August, and reached Mr. Stoud's before
the sun went down, and after waiting
for a few minutes, started again. Just
after sunset. By the time I got to the
Namazi crossing it had got quite dark,
except for a little ljght the new moon
was giving. The road leading to the
Gala Estate from the main road has
only just recently been made, and is
quite soft and lumpy, besides being
very steep for at least half its length.
The rest of it is fairly level, but none
of it is in a condition for cycling yet,
except the portion which extends from
my first plantation to my house, which
was made some time ago, and is now
nice and hard.
"When I left the main road I dis
mounted, and started pushing my bi
cycle up the hill, but before I had gone
far I heard a heavy body pushing its
way through the bush on my left. I
thought it was some big game, possibly
an eland or buffalo, but as I felt a cer
tain amount of uneasiness I went to the
other side of the road and pushed away
as quickly as I could. When I had gone
a short distance up the slope I looked
wood County, he became calmer still,
On Wednesday, when the rioting
reached its climax, the Governor was
as serene as a summer morning, and on
Saturday, when the trouble was all
over and most of the white men had put
away their guns, the Governor sent an
impassioned dispatch to Greenwood de
manding that the rioting stop.
Major Tolbert has returned to his
post as Collector of the Port at Charles
ton. All the other Tolberts except those
badly wounded, together ' with their
relatives and associates, have gone to
Washington to get satisfaction through
Federal interference.
The burning question of the hour is
what will become of the Tolberts. The
white men's party around Greenwood
declare that if they return to their
homes they will be killed and their
houses will be burned over their dead
bodies.
This is evidently no joke. It has hap
pened again and again to white Repub
licans all over the South. It has hap
pened as frequently in South Carolina
as in any other State. What a South
Carolina mob can do when aroused was
shown at Lake City, where the colored
Postmaster and his entire family were
either murdered or burned to death.
Apparently the average country white
in South Carolina has made up his
mind to use the shotgun and the torch
as long as the negroes are appointed to
office or are encouraged to be active in
politics.

a full-grown lion standing across the
road, broadside on, with his head turn,
ed toward me,* and, as I looked, he
started in pursuit.
"T attempted to mount my machine,
but owing to the slope and ray excite
ment I failed twice. The third time I
succeeded in getting away, and I did
pedal for all I was worth, but the ma
chine kept wobbling across the road,
and I saw that the lion had lessened
the distance between us by about half,
though I was still fifty yards from the
top of the slope. He kept up a low
growling all the time, and I could hear
him more and more distinctly every
time as he still lessened the distance
between us.
"I think I could easily have outstrip
ped him if it had been level, but the
machine kept up a rattle, rattle over
the inequalities in the road, and once
or twice I was almost thrown off. I
did not dare to look back; indeed, there
was no need, as the growl plainly told
me that he was almost on me, but at
last I reached the crest and flew down,
the opposite slope. I then suddenly re
membered that there was an open cul
vert across the road some 200 yards
ahead, but there was no time to dis
mount, so I rode into it, and the shock
flung me high out of the saddle, but I
fell back on it without being knocked
off. Fortunately the side of the drain
next the hill was high and the opposite
side low, so that the machine was not
stuck in the culvert, and though the
front fork was twisted and the front
wheel grated against it it was not quite
jammed and I was able to ride on.
When I reached the smooth part of the
road near my first plantation I was able
to get up a good rate of speed, but I no
longer heard the growl in the rear.

THE church denominations of California are fervently prayintr for rain. An annual substantial drenching means millions
of dollars to the farmers, 'miners and merchants of the State. The drought of last year was a hard blow to the agricul
tural and mineral industries. Hundreds of big mines were shut down along the Stern foothills and the crops anl
cattle of the grangers never suffered so much. Some weather prophets are already en record with the declaration that
laÂ«t "year's drought will be repeated this year. Certain kinds of witch hazel augurs point to this conclusion, and many
hunters of game are of this opinion on account of the "dry winter" actions of plants and wild birds. Should they be
rieht in their prognostications there will be great suffering in the agricultural and mineral districts. Other prophets be
lieve that the holidays will usher in the welcome rainstorms. Since the prayers began in the churches the State has re
ceived several showers, but not a storm of any consequence.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 17.â An
insect that is able to do one
hundred million dollars'
worth of damage to the
farmers of the United States
in a single year may well be regarded
as the most dangerous and destructUe
of the many foes against which the ag
riculturists of thiÂ§ country are obliged
to fight for a living. This is the highest
record up to date of the famous chinch
bug which has been such a sorrow in
recent times In Missouri. Kansas and
other States of the Middle West.
Hence it is not surprising that the Gov
ernment should be making a serious
study of the creature in question, or
that an elaborate publication on the
Â«uhjert should be now in course of pre
paration. The letter is from the pea of
Professor Webster, the well-known en
tomologist, and will be Published short
ly by the Department of Agncultura
Professor Webster says that the
chinch-bug first made its PJ^m-e
known in this country by Kb javagea
in the wheat fields of the North Caro
lina farmers in 1785. From 1840 to Ito9
it attacked Illinois and portions of In
diana and Wisconsin. The loss which
it caused to the farmers in Illinois in
Â£-.0 was reckoned at $4,000,000 or $4 70
â¢*y.r every man. woman and child living
in the State. The earlier outbreaks,
though the occasion of smaller money
loss were even more disastrous, for the
destruction of the grain crops in those
pi,,neer days not only took away all
cash profits, but also deprived the early
settlers of their very living, and in
Borne cases reduced them to starvation.
From 1863 to 1865 the insect was again
active and it was estimated that
three-fourths of the wheat and half of
the corn crops wore wiped out through
almost the entire Northwest. This
meant a loss of 30.000.000 bushels of
wheat and 138,000,000 bushels of corn,
representing a total value of more than
$73,000,000. , .
There was a serious outbreak of the
chinch-bug in the West in 1868. and
again in 1871, but in 1874 the ravages
were widespread and enormous. The
loss in 1371 in seven States, viz.. lowa.
Missouri, Illinois, Kansas. Nebraska.
Wisconsin and Indiana, was computed
at $30,000,000. Dr. C. V. Biley computed
the loss in Missouri alone in the year
1874 it $lf< 000,000. The Joss to the whole
-v for 1874 was not less than $100.-

stretched two tiger skin
rugs, whose fierceness of ex
pression was almost lost in a look of
vague astonishment at the splendor of
their surroundings. On the walls were
hung paintings of renown. Through a
portiered doorway was the dining
room massively elegant, and a smaller
exit led from the drawing-room to a
bedroom furnished as a Queen's cham
ber was furnished wher^ there were
thrones in France.
One of the managerial staff of the
big Waldorf-Astoria Hotel was show
ing to me the beauties of the "royal
suite," which has recently sheltered
the visiting Princes of Belgium
"This suite costs $100 a day," said
Mr. Thomas, the assistant manager.
Nine years ago the writer prepared
an interview with one of the best
known hotel men in the metropolis in
which it was stated that $10,000 a year
was all that a man, wife and maid ser
vant could spend in board and lodging
in the highest-priced hotels in America,
occupying the most expensive suite of
rooms to be found, eating the costliest
food on the menu and drinking the
most expensive ines. It was pre
sumed that the man was not a glutton,
nor a drunkard; neither did he throw
money away in extravagant tips. He
simply lived up to the limit, and $10,000
was the limit for mere food and shelter
in the most expensive hotel the new
world had. Let us see what it would
cost to-day.
"There is more money to-day than
there ever was before in this country,
if onÂ£ may judge by what is spent in
hotefs," continued Mr. Thomas. "Big
fortur.es are being made nowadays in
the street, in mines and in business,
and the money is rapidly being put into
circulation. Ten years ago you very
seldom saw two men on a man's trap.
Now it is the rule. Men spend more for
food, for wines for apartments, jewel
ry. Theaters cost more, entertainments
are more lavish and the accommoda
tions in hotels have grown accordingly.
Money can't buy anything better than
what you're looking at. The furniture
in this suite co3t more than $50,000.
Hotel service has Improved. One is
served now in a public restaurant as he
could only have been served ten years
ago in his own home, and in very few
homes was the service as nearly perfect
as it is now in most really first-class
hotels.
".Vine years ago the highest-priced
suite of rooms in any hctei in this city
cost $100 a week.
"Our suites cost from $10 a day up to
$40," replied Mr. Thomas, "and we have
large ones for families that run from
that figure up 10 $100. We have one
suite now occupied by a gentleman and
his family which costs $88 per day, and
that is exclusive of food and service.
Those are ordinary prices for people of
wealth, who demand the very best that
is to be had and are willing to pay for
it."
A comparison of the present prices
with those of a decade ago offers a sig
nificant and startling contrast. If the
opi nrtuniiy to spend money in hotels is
a fair criterion of the prosperity of the
times, this country was never so pros
perous as it is now.
These Two Insects Have Destroyed
was estimated at $60,000,000. the heav
iest losses occurring: in Illinois, lowa,
Missouri and Kansas. This gives, as the
estimated loss in the thirty-eight years,
1850 to 18S7, the enormous sum of $267,
000,000. Another chinch - bug plague
reached its maximum severity in 1596.
Careful estimates of the loss during tne
last seven years would in all probabil
ity swell the amount to fully $330,000,
000 for the period from ISSO to 1898.
During the outbreak in Ohio at least
two farmers became discouraged and
sought relief in suicide.
It should be taken into consideration
that the financial losses above esti
mated have not fallen upon the entire
nation, but upon the nine States
named. In fact, small as it is. the
chinch-bug has cost the people of these
nine States a sum of money sufficient to
defray the entire expense of the na
tional government for a whole year
Fire excepted, there is probably no
other thing that has caused ko great a
financial loss within the same period
over the same area of country.
No other insect, native to the west
ern hemisphere, has spread its devas
tating hordes over a wider area of
country with more fatal effects to the
staple grains of North America than
has this one. But for the extreme sus
ceptibility to the very yount* to de
struction by drenching rains, the prac
tice of raising grain year after year on
the same areas, as followed in the
T'nited States, would be altogether un
profitable. It wems *r> be a fact that
plentiful rain destroys the chinch-bugs,
Nine years ago, as before mentioned,
the price of the costliest suite of rooms
in an American hotel was $100 a week.
Allowing the man the most epicurean
taste consonant with reason and the
tef's resources, his breakfast could
t cost him more than $3 a day on an
erage; his luncheon, with wine. $6,
and his dinner, with wine, $10. The
board of the servant was put down at
$9 a week. This did not take in tips,
cigars, liquors, except wines, or the en
tertainment of friends, because these
expenses would be the same whether
the man lived at a hotel or at his own
house. The total expenses for six
Knths, which is all the time this man

i, the improved service which hotels

it was supposed that the man did not

if It comes at the nroper time. The
years of greatest abundance of the pest
are apt to be preceded by a series of
years of drought.
Each female chinch-bug laysaboutsoo
eggs, and the adult insect is not pro
duced until sixty days later. The new
ly hatched young are very active, and
the first to appear may be observed
with their progenitors about the bases
of wheat, corn or grass plants, and
later all stages are seen mingling to
gether, having little appearance of be
longing to the same species, so greatly
do they vary in size and color in their
several stages of development. On first
emerging from the chrysalis the adult
is generally of a dull pink color. In
a short time these colors change to the
normal ones of the species, which are
black as to the body, with white wings.
From attack by enemies the chinch
bug seems to be protected in some de
gree by its vile odor, which is similar
to that of the related bedbug. How
ever, in the Middle West the birds
which are its natural foes, such as the
quail, are being ruthlessly . wiped out
by the shotgun. This fact may ac
count, in a measure, for the bugs'
spread and multiplication, but. as will
be explained later, only in a small de
gree. Various predacious insects feed
on the chinch-bug, but they do notseem
to be of great importance. Indeed, the
spread of the pest is accounted for
largely by the absence of natural ene
mies within the limits of the United
States.
The most important natural foes of
been erected in the far South and on
the Pacific Coast where the* expenses
are about as high as they are in town.
A man bent on paying the highest pos
sible prices for his rooms should have
no difficulty to-day in finding- accom
modations during his six months away
from home that will cost an average
of $20 a day. In some instances the
price may be greater, but that is a fair
average. The maid's board will aver
age $15 a week and the services of a
butler $15 more. The meals will cost
$20 a day. It figures up as follows:
Mpals, r?r wwk $140 00
Maid's board, per week 15 00
Kutlor's services, per week 16 00
Rooms, per week 140 00
Total per week $310 00
Total for six months Â» $Â»,oâ¬o 00
Grand total for year $31.605 60
Of course these figures represent the
highest amount a man can possibly pay
for such accommodations. There is no
attempt made in these calculations t<>
economize. The man deliberately seeks
for the highest priced articles he can
find, and it costs him $33,000 a year.
Nine years ago he did the very same
thing, he spent all that he could, but
$9800 was tho limit.
We are supposing an extreme case.
Men can live at these same expensive
hotels modestly and at a moderate cost.
Rooms with a bath may be had at the
Waldorf-Astoria, and at all the other
hotels mentioned at from $5 to $7 a day,
and the meals may be made to cost
pretty nearly what a man chooses to
pay.
But the man who wants to spend
money in hotel living never had as
good a chance to do so as he has to
day. BENJAMIN NORTHROP.
INTERNATIONAL POSTAGE.
John A. Merritt, the Third Assistant
! Postmaster General, in his annual re
port recommends immediate negotia
tions with the postal administrations
of England, Germany and France to
reduce the international postage rates
to 2 cents for a half ounce or fraction
thereof. The report says:
"The administrations named have
direct or separate postal intercourse
to a large extent with our country,
and consequently are more likely to
agree to the change desired than the
administrations of inland countries that
j have to pay transportation charges to
the seacoast to intermediary nations.
The English administration particu
larly will probably assent to the pro
posed arrangement, for it has but re
cently decided to adopt the 2-cent rate
on letters between the British Islands
and Canada, as well as other parts of
the empire â the change being ordered
to take effect December 25 next.
"The department now realizes nothing
in the way of revenue from ocean let
ters, practically all the postage paid on
them going to the steamship companies
carrying the mails. If the rate should
be reduced the same state of affairs
would exist: the department would
still get nothing and lose nothing, and
the steamship companies would suffer
no hardship, for the stimulus given to
correspondence by the reduction of rate
| would no doubt eventually at least give
them as much compensation in the way
of postage as they now get.
"An ocean penny postage would con
nect and permeate all the sea-divided
communities of mankind with myriads
of/new ties and veins to strengthen and
beautify their brotherhood with bonds
of sympathy and the circulation of
knowledge. It would be one of the most
powerful aids to the work of Christian
missions. An ocean penny postage is
demanded by the social necessities of
the Anglo-Saxon race. The reduction
does not require action of Congress, as
the Postmaster General has authority
under section 398 of the revised stat
utes."

Kansas entomologist. Professor Snow,

humble but destructive plants for the
purpose of infectine healthy chinch

How Favorite Actresses Save Their Money
Special to The Sunday Call.
NEW YORK, Nov. 25.â The actor is proverbially a spendthrift,
and the women of the craft vary little in this respect from their
brothers. There are any number of rich actors of both sexes,
but few of them are rich through their own prudence or good
investment.
There is one clever comic opera star whose wealth is largely
the result of his careful disbursement of funds and his saving habits;
but he is held up as a remarkable example â not 1n his own profession,
for the actor prudent in money affairs is about as unpopular as a
sporting man who refuses to keep up his reputationfor good fellowship
by frequent loans to his improvident fellows.
The richest actors have been the most reckless spenders. Fritz
Emmett, who was the best-paying star of his time, and whose fortune

accumulated as though by magic, threw his money right and left in
the most extravagant fashion. Joseph Murphy, who is wealthy, has
never been miserly in his expenditures. Maggie Mitchell, Lotta,
Fanny Davenport â three of the richest women stars â have all lived
lavishly, had costumes and jewels that cobt " irtunes. Bernhardt has
squandered several fortunes and is always in debt.
The most conspicuous example of business acuteness. shrewdness,
daring andapparent luck in investment among the women of the stage
Is personified in Mrs. Lillie Langtry, who has made a fortune in almost
every venture to vhlch she lias turned her hand. She has never been
parsimonious, but her dealings have always reen guided by a shrewd,
clear head. When she came to this country she imported Englishserv
ants, because they were to be had for one-third the price paid in New
York.
She took a house in New York instead of stopping at a big hotel â
not a fashionable house, but an old, roomy house, which is marked by
the high fence which shut out' the curious view of passersby. Her
house at Long Branch was chosen in the same way â not for its showy
pretentiousness or location, but for its solid return in comfort for the
cash expended.
While Mrs. Langtry was in this country she invested largely in
flat property in the tenement district of New York, which is said to
have increased enormously in value within the last few years. Her
California ranch was another paying venture, in spite of the vast
amount of money which she put into it and the loss she sustained in a
railway accident in which some valuable horses were killed.
But in every case Mrs. Langtry realizes a profit. She sold her
yacht, the White Ladye, at a goodly su i, which was all profit, as the
yacht had been a gift to the actrVss. It was the same with her private
car, which she disposed of by telegraph, making a handsome margin
on the original outlay. Her stable in England is another gold mine,
some of her horses recently carrying off some of the richest stake 3of
the English turf. She has a large fortune invested in jewels.
Mrs. Langtry employs any number of men to take care of her
business interests, but she gives her personal attention to all. Her
special representative in London says that she has none of the varia
bleness of woman in her composition in dealing with business affairs.
She makes up her mind as to how she will proceed in Important mat
ters with lightning rapidity. She hesitates at no expense in carrying
out her plans, and frequently wires her man in London to start for
New York at a day's notice.
Yvette Guilbert is another prudent, almost stingy, artist, who has
a beautiful home in Paris, a chateau in the country, fine jewels and
than moribund insects, and it may be
scattered over a field with far greater
ease and convenience.
The effectiveness of this plan for com
municating plague to chinch-bugs ar
tificially has been much questioned, but
Professor Webster and other scientists
to-day pretty generally admit that it
ttcoompliPhes wonderful results. In a
firld of wheat that has been treated in
the manner described, the track of the
insects as they move in any direction
is literally paved with their dead bod
ies, each little corpse enveloped in a
white winding sheet of fungus. In
places thu' ground is white with them,
and, on stirring up the soil at the edge
of a cornfield, it is found to be full of
dead chinch-bugs to a depth of two or
three inches, the white fungus covered
bodies contrasting strongly with the
black color of the rich loam. Never
theless, it seems that the fungus has
little effect except where the insects
are very thick, bo as to make contagion
easy. Furthermore, it requires moist
weather for its maximum efficiency.
"There ought to be a central propa
gating station for the disease-fungus,
from which farmers could obtain
promptly an abundant supply," says
Professor Webster. "FarnTeVs, also,
should watch the seasons carefully, and
when there are two dry summers in
succession, every preventive measure
should be adopted â notably the burn
ing of leaves, dead grass and other rub
bish during winter or early spring, fol
lowed up by sowing small plats of
early millet, Hungarian grass, or spring
wheat, in low damp places in the fields,
with a view of attacting the females
and massing the bugs, and then freely
applying the fungus in their midst."
One very effective method of fighting
chinch bugs is to lay a line of fresh coal
tar as a barrier between a migrating
horde and the field which they are ad
vacing to attack. The line, poured from
the nozzle of a watering pot with the
sprinkler removed, needs to be only
three quarters of an inch wide, and at
intervals of twenty feet in its length
are dug holes, in which tin cans are
sunk. The insects proceed along the
tar line until they fall into the cans,
where they are easily killed with a lit
tle kerosene. In this way the bugs are
caught literally by the bushel.
Chinch bugs are essentially gregari
ous, gathering and feeding together in
flocks. On reachiner a suitable field of
grain they congregate upon the stalks
until the latter are literally covered
with the insects, varying in color from
the black and white adults to the dif
ferently tinted larvae. Only the winged
adults fly, the main body of less de
veloped bugs remaining and leaving in
a body only when the plants on which
they have congregated have been drain
ed of their juices and have begun to
wither. Then they aimply crawl to the
gowns all as a result of her saving: habits. In the hotels In which she
stopped while In New York her parsimony became a huge joke with
the bellboys and chambermaids. She values a dollar for a hundred
cents and obtains its worth in every case. But Guilbert comes natur
ally by hor saving instincts, for her youth knew the bitterest pov
erty and hardship. . , .
Cora Potter Is an instance of a woman who has saved a comfort
able fortune out of her earnings on the stage, although there are many
who never have admitted her success as an artist. In her tours of
Australia and in South Africa Mrs. Potter reaped a golden harvest,
and she has her money invested in bonds, in jewels and in a collection
of laces and curios.of which she- is most fond. Her house in St. Johns

paintings of value. She never has been frugal in her living, but has
been one of the careful ones on the stage.
Maude Adams, whose leap into sudden success has made her fa
mous, has also begun her stage career well by investing her earnings
in a new kind of bond called investment bonds, which insure the life of
the possessor. Many of the younger actresses are saving in this way,

nearest healthy plants and begin work
on them. A general migration by flight
takes place in the autumn.
Favorite articles of chinch bug diet
are broom corn, sorghum, Bermuda
grass, blue grass, bottle grass and crab
grass. Over the Western country the
major portion of the damage done is to
fields of wheat, barley, rye and corn.
Oats are rarely attacked. The female
chinch bug deposits her eggs about the
roots of grasses and grain plants. In
early days the insect doubtless sub
sisted on the native grasses, but it
readily acquired a taste for exotic
kinds.
Last summer Entomologist-in-Chief
Howard of the Department of Agricul
ture found chinch hups in the act of
destroying the lawn in a Brooklyn,
park.
In 1897 an assistant of Professor How
ard's collected chinch bugs from coarse
grass, incrusted with a salty deposit, in
the Colorado Desert of California. This
locality is considerably below the ocean
level and represents an ancient exten
sion of the Gulf of California.
The immunity of the chinch bug from
attacks by natural enemies is so strik
ing that it has attracted the attention,
of all ento* '-cists who have made a
study of the species, and all accept this
as indicating that it is an exotic, not
originally belonging to our insect fauna.
Professor "Webster's theory is that the
bug is of tropical seashore origin, and
worked its way northward centuries
ago by way of the east coast of Cen
tral America. Apparently the chinch
bug occupied the most of the country
prior to its occupancy by the white
man, and its first * depredations were
caused by its coming in contact with
the advance of civilization.
Not until within the last fifteen years
has the chinch bug been known to work
serious and widespread injury east of
the Allegheny Mountains, north of Vir
ginia; and west of these mountains
they have done scarcely any damage
north and east of a line drawn from
Chicago southeast to Cincinnati.
Thousands of farmers in Ohio never
saw a chinch bug until within the last
four years, and there are thousands
more in Northwestern Ohio, Southern
Michigan and Northern Indiana that
even yet would not be able to recognize
one were they to see it among their
growing grain. RENE BACHE.

THESE MONKS HAVE SPOKEN ONLY TWICE IN FIFTY YEARS
THE -muffled knell of a deep
chested bell wafted through the
crisp, cold air of a Kentucky
morning summoned, on October
2<.to a ceremony of unusual im
port the Trappist monks of (ieth^>
mane Abbey. This ceremony, the in
stallation of a now abbot, has been per
formed only once before within the sa
cred precincts of this holy place, and
for this occasiop the solitary and silent
brotherhood were given a freedom
which comes to them only once in many
years, and the memory of which will
serve to lltrhten many weary hours of
toil and solitary penitence.
Pay after day the Trappist monks go
their narrow way In silence ami in
eolitude. They speak to no one â not
even to their brothersâ and when
through illness or want they are com-
pellÂ°d to break silence it is only per
missible through a special dispensa

"What little earthly joy is theirs comes
from- within, and the"hours not spent in

tilling the soil. It is. a custom of the
Trappists to settle in localities where
the land needs cultivating?, and their
persistent labor transforms barren
wastes Into fruitful, yielding groves
arid gardens.
SECTIONS OF SAN FRANCISCO
WHERE DISEASE IS PREVALENT
The Board of Health has just issued a series of maps indicating the localities in the city where diphtheria, pneumonia,
typhoid fever and kindred diseases are reported to be most virulent. The object of issuing the map is to
warn property-owners and residents that by proper improvements and remedies the infected sections can be
raised' to the level of health of the rest of the city. The map shows Chinatown to be the most infected district.
THE Board of Health of San Francisco has just issued a map show
ing the districts in which certain diseases are most prevalent and
also the points where the most deaths have occurred during the
last fiscal year. Three localities in the city stand out prominent
ly on this "sickness map": Chinatown, the Latin quaiter and the section
generally called -'South of Market street.'*
The total number of deaths in the Latin quarter for this year was
257. This is the district bounded by Powell, Greenwich,
Broadway and Sansome streets.
In Chinatown there were 540 deaths, about 120 of which were
Caucasians and Africans. Chinatown includes the district bounded
t>y Kearny, Powell, California and Broadway.
Eight hundred and four deaths occurred in the district known as
south of Market street, running from First to Eighth streets and
from Market to Brannan streets.
The greatest number of deaths in any one square was 148. This
square is bounded by Pacific, Dupont. Broadway and Stockton streets.
In the Latin quarter there were 21 deaths in the square bounded
by Kearny, Dupont, Broadway and Vallejo streets.
Soutn. of Market street, in the square bounded by Folsom, Harri
son, Sixth and Fifth streets, there were 55 deaths.
The largest number of deaths in any one square in the Mission
was 13.
In the Western Addition 10 deaths is the maximum number for
one square.
Below will be found the explanation for this extraordinary mor
tality in certain sections of the city.
THE distribution of the most viru
lent and contagious diseases In
San Franciscu is shown by the
accompanying map. it Is the
first of its kind ever published In
this city, and one of a very few of
similar nature published in other cities
qt the United States. The data upon
. which it is based are the figures and a
new 'series of most graphic and useful
maps prepared by Statistician Will D.
Griffin of the Health Department for
the annual report of 1897-98.
Only, a glance at the map is required
to. discover the location of the nursery
of. San Francisco's sickness. In the
area known as Chinatown and its im
mediate environment the total number
at deaths from all diseases during the
fiscal year 1897-98 was 540, notwith
standing that this area contains only
twelve pquares. Of this number of
deaths less than one hundred were not
Chinese..
Xt is common knowledge in the Health
.pepartment that all sick Chines. â  In
San Francisco go to the Chinatown dis
trict to die. They carry with them
iht-o their hovels tuberculosis, fevers,
pulmonary complaints and saturate
the air with the deadly germs they
breathe. The result is that not even
the East Side of New York or the for
eign quarter of any American city is
more given to fatal diseases.
The one block bounded by
Dupont, Stockton, Broadway and
Pacific streets reported the ex
traordinary number of 148 deaths
during the fiscal year. Other blocks
in the same vicinity reported aggre
gates' running from 25 to 81 deaths.
.That these large numbers are alto
gether abnormal is made evident by

labor and prlvatjon.
The order was founded in the year
400 by St. Bernard, on much" the same
plan as it exists to-day, but the de
mands were so great that the disci
pline was for a time relaxed, until, in
LIOO, it was restored by the Abbey of
Citeaux, and the name Cistercian
Monks was adopted. Pome years later
the rules were again modified. Finally,
at the Abbey of La Trappy in the year
the Influence of Abbot Huaz re
instated the strict rule of former years,
and from that time forward it has re

Scarlet and typhoid fever are spread
over the largest expanse, but they are
correspondingly lighter in number. In
no case, outside of the military camps,
which were not fully reported in the
fiscal year, were there more than four
to six fatalities in any one block.
Similarly with the pneumonia, pluer- â¢
isy and other acute lung diseases, the
deaths and cases reported extended i
farther into th Western Addition than
any of the other marked diseases. The

From an overhanging gallery women in
modish gowns, rosy cheeked with the
unusual excitement, stood side by side
with wives of Kentucky moonshiners,
dressed in bright cotton fabrics and the
conventional sunbonnet of the moun

of vantage.
The ceremony itself was impressive.
At a little after 10 o'clock the bell
ceased tolling, and a long line of black
robed acolytes entered the chapel, bear
ing candles, which threw a weird glow
upon the wan faces of the monks when
they went to take their places a few
moments later. Following the acolytes
was the bishop, in a trailing robe of
purple, and the abbot, in a gown of
spotless white that shimmered and
shone in the light of the waxen tapers.

during the summer about six years ago
and tried the experiment on his own
responsibility. It was so successful
that he put forth his best efforts to get
the United States Government to make
it a practice.
Just recently Joseph Murray, who
was this quiet but most Important fac

home In Fort Collins, Colo., after ten
years in Alaska. He brought his report
with him, but before he could present
it he was suddenly stricken with pa

An interesting feature of the service

reference to his position at the head of
the fold. The crozier presented to
Father Obrecht is an elaborate affair,
composed of more than 7000 pieces of

spent ten years on the work.

have been depleted had not some means
been adopted to stem the tide of pela
gic slaughter. And so rapacious
have been the pelagic sealers that
our Government has even con
templated the killing of all of our
herds in order to circumvent the
conscienceless marauders of the north
seas. But humane scruples intervened
and no such extreme measures have
been resorted to. Various methods,
however, were adopted by our Govern
ment by which the herds, although ter
ribly decimated, have been kept intact
and a sufficient number of seals re
main. If properly protected, to perpetu
ate the snecies. The first step taken to
ward conserving the herds was the an
nual branding of the female seals. This
experiment was suggested to Mr. Mur
ray's mind by the custom in vogue in
Colorado and other States of the West
of branding of cattle, with which he
was well acquainted. The purpose to
I be attained was to make the skins of
the female peals valueless for eommer
i cial uses, and thus render the animals
immune from the ravages of the pela
gic sealers. The idea was received by
j the higher authorities with but little
favor at nrst, but consent was finally
given to have the experiment tried.
Those opposing it expressed a fear that
if the branding did not absolutely de
stroy the life of the seal, it would im
pair its reproductive faculties. The
experiment was first tried upon adult
seals. A full-grown seal with a pud at
her size was first to be branded, and
the iron was brought to a white heat
and the animal branded to the very
quick, yet but little p;iin was mani
fested by the seal, and as soon as the
operation was done the old seal went to
her pup and calmly nursed it. After
some 350 adult female seals had been
hranded, the branding was confined to
pup seals between the age of three and
four months. The entire back of the
animal, from hip to shoulder, is grid-
Ironed with deeply burned scars, so
that the skin is rendered absolutely
valueless for the manufacture of furs,
and the animal is left to breed by the
open sea sealers.
The special agent then directed his
efforts to the preservation of the male
seals. The open or pelagic season un
der the present international agreement
between the United States and Great
Britain extends from the first of Au
gust until the first of October. This
period is included within the breeding
season, when the seals, both male and
female, old and younsr. are inhabiting
the rookeries. The breeding females
are caring for their young, the breed
ing males or bulls have charge of their
harems, while the non-breeding males
or "bachelors" are compelled by the
bulls to herd by themselves. The males
take little or no food during this sea
son, while the females are obliged to
go to sea dai'- to obtain food in or
der properly to nourish their young.
Scattered over the seal islands are
numerous lakes and lagoons, connect
ing with the sea b- means of narrow
inlets, through which these smaller
bodies of water are supplied with fresh
j water by the action of two tides dally.
From San Francisco the special agent
had transported a large quantity of
â¢wire nettin' with which he fenced these
lakes and lagoons about, leaving open
in~a through which the seals could be
driven and which could be closed by
means of Â£_ates. The bachelor seals
were driven into these inclosures about
the first of August and kept until the
! first of October, and having plenty of
; fresh water to disport In and by na-*
ture requiring no food, were kept In
good condition until the open season
j had exnlred. when they were let out
I and allowed to frequent the open sea
again. These methods have been so ef
fective in their results that the pelagic
sealers have become well nigh discour
aged.

FRESNO, Nov. 17.â Should a min
ister of the Gospel practice hyp
notism?
This is the rather peculiar
question -which is being dis
cussed in church circles in this
.city. This agitation is the result of sev
":>fnl remarkable cures which Dr. J. K.
Carpenter, pastor of the South Metho
dist Church, has effected by means of
â¢ : . Hypnotism. He has cured the cigarette
: habit, drunkenness and dyspepsia â
throe things which the reverend gen
: Neman declares do not yield readily to
" : preaching.
Dr. Carpenter has been in Fresno for
. the last throe years, having come here
from Stockton, where he was pastor of
the Orarp Methodist Episcopal Church.
Jl^ has been very popular in this City,
; and his sermons have been character
ize^ by broadness and even radical
views. He has been enterprising and
progressive, and under his pastorate
the present handsome church â the
handsomest in the cityâ was built. At
the last conference Rev. Mr. Carpenter
was assigned to a charge in New Mcx
â  ico', and left a few days ago for his new

Th-ere are people in this town to-day
who would burn witches. Yes, sir,

witch but a hypnotist?"
"Then you contend that it is perfectly
proper for a minister to hypnotize â
that is, becoming to his station and all
that?"
"I most assuredly do. Why, take a
drunkard, for instance. In nine cases

QUEER IDEAS OF FEMALE BEAUTY
In some parts of the world the shape of the head is of great importance. Many American Indians ad
mire a head so extremely flattened as to appear to us idiotic. The natives of the norchwest coast compress the
head into a pointed cone, while the inhabitants of Arakhan admire a broad, smooth forehead, and in order to
produce it they fasten a plate of lead on the heads of the new-born children.
IT is curious to note the queer ideas
of beauty â¢which characterize dif
ferent nations. In Fiji the native
women paint their faces with red
â¢' and white stripes as an ornament,
v" The .women of Greenland cover their
.'â¢â¢ faces with blue and yellow, while
'.Arabian beauties stain their lips blue
and their fingers and toes red.
The pearly teeth of the poet and nov
elist would not be valued by some of
â¢the Eastern and Polynesian nations.
: In Macassar the women paint their
teeth red and yellow in such a way that
a red tooth follows a yellow one, and
: alternately: The teeth of the Ton
quin-ese are as black as art can make
. them. The dyeing occupies three or
four days, and is done to both boys and
girls when they are about twelve years
: Df age.
' .'During the whole operation, says Tit
Bits, they never take any nourishment
' for fear of being poisoned by the pig
ment if they swallowed what required
: mastication. Every person, high and
low. rich and poor, is obliged to under
go this somewhat objectionable opera
tion, as it is alleged that it would be a
; disgrace to human nature to have
teeth white like those of dogs or ele
â¢j phants.
â  : - In Japan fashion compels married
. women to blacken their teeth, not, how
ever, as an ornament, but to make
: them. more ugly and save them from
. temptation. t - aa ,^
â  The Sunda Islanders sometimes
blacken all the teeth but two with
burned cocoanut. covering the two ex
â  cepted teeth with thin plates of gold
â â or silver. The same tribe is in the habit
jf employing their old women to dress
up the teeth of the youths and maidens
at wooing times. The canine teeth are
â¢ .filed to a line, smooth edge, and the
'body of the tooth made concave, , or
they will notch the edge of the teeth
like a fine saw as an additional means
"of beautifying. Â»
This mutilation of the teeth is ob
served by many of the savage or un
civilized races in various parts of the
' world. In the Malay Archipelago the
' natives ille their teeth into points like
those of a saw or pierce- them with
holes, into which they insert studs. The
Macassar people sometimes pull out
two front teeth in order to supply their
â  places with teeth of pure gold or silver.
Some African tribes knock out their
front teeth, on the ground that they do
not wish to look like beasts. On the
Upper Nile four front teeth are always
knocked out, but further south only
the two upper incisors are dispensed

"My object in practicing hypnotism
as a minister is simply to do good.
Now I want it understood that I do not
make a business of it, but, as they say
at the restaurant, it is merely 'on the
side.' My calling is that of a min
ister, but I believe that a minister
should be more than that word ordi
narily implies. A true minister should
be both a teacher and a healer, as
Christ was. I have never received any
money for any of my treatments.

it was not my business.

but six or eight in one day are too
many."
Dr. Carpenter's cures have not been
confined to smoking and drinking. He
has cured an affection of the eye, dys
pepsia and a number of complaints of
a nervous character. His fame has
spread in a quiet way and people from
different parts of the State have come
here to be treated by him.
Among those treated by Mr. Carpen
ter was W. S. Badger, a prominent
young attorney. He went to him to be
cured of the tobacco habit. The treat
ment was most successful. In fact,
two birds were killed with one stone,

Tn some parts of the world the nose is

They endeavor to produce the impres

for the lawyer was also cured of dys
pepsia, although it may be that his re
fraining from smoking was accountable
for the disappearance of his dyspepsia.
He speaks very highly of Dr. Carpen
ter's treatment and not even a cam
paign cigar tempted him to take a few
whiffs.
Another person treated successfully
was Elmer E. Hartsough, runner for
the Grand Central Hotel. His experi
ence is best told in his own words.
"Say, that's all right. Now let me
tell you, for eight years I smoked cigar
ettes all the time â well, I won't say all
the time â but I smoked a package of
tobacco a day easy. "Why, you never
saw me but I was rolling a cigarette or
smoking one. Well, I was persuaded
to go to the minister. Dr. Carpenter,
for treatment. I didn't believe in it
and I said so.
"He said to mo: 'You don't have to.'
"Well, he kind of hypnotized me and
said: 'You won't have any further de
sire to smoke.'
"I laughed, but when 1 got outside
th>- first thing I did was to throw away
a bag of tobacco and a bunch of cigar
ette papers and I haven't smoked since.
1 just haven't any desire at all. That's
right."
Led Winohell, who is employed in
Genera] Muller's office, is another man
who was successfully treated for the
cigarette habit. He had been an in
veterate smoker for years. "I tell you
it's wonderful." he explained. "I had
been trying to quit smoking for years
but could not do it. I took all
sorts of cures for tobacco, but
they didn't do me any good. Since Dr.

ACTRESSES WHO MARRIED
MILLIONAIRES.
EVERY time an actress marries a
young man of wealth and social
position there is a stir, as if it were
an unusual occurrence. But the truth
is that it has been going on ever since
the introduction of women upon the
acting stage.
It is half a century ago that Mary
Taylor, who was then the reigning fav
orite of the town, left the stage at the
invitation of wealth. She was without
] years of his life, when he appeared to
| the world as a prophet and Messiah.
There are many spots in the Holy Land
which are associated with the mother
of dnd. She was a native of Nazareth.
Christ was born to her at Bethlehem.
He was brought up under her care at
Nazareth. Later the family domicile
was transferred to Jerusalem. After
the crucifixion, according to the legend,
Mary fled with St. John the evangelist
to Ephesus, where the beloved disciple
built her a house, in which she spent
i her last days.
In Nazareth is still pointed out the
remains of what is claimed to be the
erstwhile home of the holy family. This
is now a portion of the Latin convent, a
large, square building inclosed by a
wall. A chapel known as the Church of
the Annunciation rises over the spot,
but underneath the church are shown
desire to smoke."
The objections of certain' townspeople
to a minister practicing hypnotism are,
as yet, not well defined. Most' of the
objectors think that it does not become
a minister's station. In fact, one
prominent church member declares
that Dr. Carpenter is not a minister
at all. but a hvnnotist. Despite all the
objectors the doctor goes serenely on
his way practicing what he preaches
and the deacons of the church smile on
him approvingly.

The most extensive system of seacoast
defense in the world is being rapidly
completed at this point in connection with
the original fortification of Fort Monroe.
Great progress was made on the original
plans of the Fortification Board during
the war, much of the $50,000,000 emergency
appropriation being expended here. Just
why the remaining work on these plans
and the extensions of the scheme of de
fenses is being completed in such haste
no one appears to know. The engineer
officers in charge of the work express
their pleasure at the disappearance of the
annoying series of delays experienced in
inaugurating the work. The almost anti
quated original Fort Monroe and the two
modern disappearing gun batteries, and
mortar battery will shortly be increased
by the addition of three concrete emplace
ments for disappearing guns of 10-inch
caliber, and the original work will be
further strengthened by the construction
of a concrete emplacement within the
walls of the orieinal stone fort. in which
will be installed a disappearing gun , of
ten or twelve inch caliber. Added to
these improvements are the four rapid
fire guns and the 8-inch rifles on the para
pet, erected in anticipation of an attack
by the Spanish fleets. : '.

Mary Anderson is probably the most j

The precise spot in Bethlehem where
the stable stood in which Christ was
born is marked by the Church of the
Nativity, originally built, according to
tradition, in the year 330 by the Em
peror Constantine. Part of the ma
sonry attributed to Constantine is still
extant, but most of the older work
dates from the time of Justinian, about
sf>o. Additions and alterations have
been made from time to time since
then, until the church as it stands is
practically a medieval structure. The
stable itself is a cave beneath the
church. Thus the cycle of tradition in
regard to the spots consecrated by the
presence of Christ as infant, boy and
man was completed at a very early
date. But the legend which took up
the story of the Virgin's life after the
death of Christ had no domiciliary wit

and Russia have each appropriated $1,

country, while it has not yet appropri

an amount far in advance of any of

received attention from the American
exhibitors, and exhibits of decorations

to erect the exposition buildings in the
very heart of the city, and therefore it
cannot be spread out as in the World's

The Paris Commissioners, on being .
urged to hold the exposition on the out

that it would be impossible to trans

absolutely necessary to erect it in the

need of space from the fact that two
and a half acres of ground have been
made by filling along the banks of the
Seine. The gardens and terraces on
both sides of the river will be utilized
and there will be exhibits on each side.
Spanning the Seine and commanding
a view of the exposition will be a new
bridge, to be known as the Pont d'Alex
andre ITI. The cornerstone of this
bridge was laid by Czar Nicholas on
October 19, 1895. Each end of the bridge
will be made a dream of loveliness. .
Pavilions, where will be received the
kings of the earth, are to be erected
along here, and the republic of France
will hold royal court.
Several of the palaces have begun to
rear their heads and others are rap
idly being constructed. The most im
posing buildings will be the two fine
art palaces, which are now being built
on the site of the old Palace de l'lndus
trie. These are to be known as the
Grand Palace dcs Beaux Arts and the
Palais dcs Petits Arts. The sum of |5.
000,000 is being spent upon their con-
Btruction. The Grand Palais holds the
finest productions of France and the
Petit Palais holds the exhibits of for
eign exhibitors. American works will
be exhibited in the Petit Palais.
The Crystal Palace, lighted by elec- â 
tricity, will be a novelty, not only in
beauty, but in electrical workmanship.

THE harbor -was crowded with fishing boats, and
iresh arrivals were coming in every few minutes.
Until the entrance was reached they came scudding
along with every appearance of haste, but then
their mainsails came tumbling down to the deck,
iÂ».nd the boats with sufficient way left on them
moved easily over the still water and felt their way to a
berth.
.^mall boats conveyed the fish to the quay, where fish
ermen were appraising the catch with a wisdom beyond
Their years.
There was a glut of whiting. So many whiting, and
..going so cheaply that it was enough to make them bite
â  their tails from sheer annoyance. Small flat fish, which
aUd away from their pile, were carefully looked after and

"There's a lot you ain't seen, Bob Tarbut," said Gubbs,

Arrelsford had fooled him would be a

"By degrees," continued Mr. Gillette,
"the" present treatment of the scene
was developed with all the incidents
connected therewith, scarcely one of
which resembles my original idea. It
often happens this v.ay in the develop

ultimately made use of in a manner en

too much strategy for sport in a large ring, at the bidding
of the resourceful individual who had last spoken, gradu
ally made it smaller and smaller. Two or three small
blows warmed the combatants, and they set to work in
earnest. Then Gubbs, under a heavy blow from Tarbut,
went to the ground and stayed there.
It was three minutes before he came thoroughly round,
and then he sat up in a dazed fashion and looked round
for his opponent.
"Did I kill 'm?" he lnauired in a whisper.
"No, not quite," said one of his friends gently.
Gubbs rubbed his eyes. "What are they patting him
on the back for?" he inquired, eying the group who were
making a fuss over Tarbut.
" 'Cos 'c's won," said his friend,
Gubbs staggered to his feet.
"It's no good," said the landlord of the Three Fisher*,
who had run over to the scene of the fray; "you wasn't
properly trained, you know. Now, look 'ere â it you put
yourself In my hands. In three weeks you can beat him
holler."
"You do as Mr. Larkins ses, Joe, ' said hie friend, Im
pressively.
"I lived among prize fighters afore I came down 'ere,"
said Mr. Larkins,. expanding his small frame. "In three
weeks' time, Gubbs. you'll be able to knock him silly."
"Well, what about Tarbut: he ought to be trained,
too," said one of the men. ''Fair play's fair play ariy
day."
"I'll train 'im," said an old ex-coast guardsman.
"I don't want no trainln'," said Tarbut surlily. "I've
beat Mm; beat 'im easy."
"Well, beat 'im again, Tarbut," said one of his friends.
"I'll put my five bob on you, who'll take me?"
For the" next five minutes, heedless of the assertions
of both men that they wouldn't fight any more, bets were
freely taken. Tarbut, in view of his recent success, being
a hot favorite.
A jarring element was introduced into the proceedings
by a sfmall elderly man wearing a piece of blue ribbon,
who, pushing his way in eagerly. Inquired what it was all
about. Nobody troubling to give him a correct answer,
he tried to *olve it for himself, and was then caught,
just in the nfbk of time, trying to make the enemies shake
hands.
"You go off to your mothers' meeting, Peter Morgan,"*
said an incensed voice.
"It's a fight." said the little man, raising his voice.
"Oh, my friends â "
"It's nothin' o' the kind," said Larkins, hotly. "I'm
trainin' 'om for a race, that's all. They're just goln' to
see who's the best runner."
Morgan, disregarding the publican, looked to others
for information.
"It's quite right," eaid a bystander, "You can believe
me, can't you?"
"When's it going to be?" asked Morgan.
"I don't know." said the other, turning away.
"You ought to be ashamed of yourselves," said Mor
gan, warmly; "it's bad enough to make a couple of men
fight what don't want to, without telling a lot of lies
about it."
"It's none o' your business," said Larkins, surlily.
"Ask no questions and you'll have no lies. "You'll get
some idea into that 'cad of jours and then go and split,
and have it stopped."
"I never told of anything in my life," said Morgan,
sharply; "my mates here know that. That ain't my way.
My way's pvrsuasion and example, not forcing people to
do what I want." 0
"There's a purse o' fifteen and six made up for the
winner," said Larkins, turning away and whispering the
news to Gubbs. "The spot for the picnic '11 be made
Known later on. Them what's in the know is respectfully
asked to keep their mouths shut to save trouble all
around."
He went back to his bar, and the other men, after
Ftanding about a bit. strolled off one by one to their teas.
Mr. Morgan was one of the last to leave, and went as
far as Tnrbufs door with him to tell him an anecdote of a
man who was struck behind the ear in a fight and killed
on the SDOt.
A comfortable meal and a good night's rest restored
Mr. Gubbs to his wonted serenity of mind, and he awoke
at 6 o'clock feeling determined to shake hands with Tar
but and let the matter drop. A persistent hammering at
the door, which gradually got louder and louder, inter
fering with his meditations, he roused Mrs. Gubbs, who
was sleeping peacefully, and with some asperity bade her
get up and stop it.
"It's Mr. Larkins. Joe," said the lady, hastily with
drawing her head from the window.
Mr. Gubbs sat up in bed. and then with a mighty yawn
rose, and pushing open the casement again gazed indig
nantly at the small publican, who was standing below
keeping up an incessant rapping on the door with a small
cane.
"Morning, Mr. Larkins, sir," said Gubbs, sniffing at
the cool morning air.
"Halloa." said Larkins, looking up. "This won't do,
you know, you're wasting time. You ought to be up and
out by now."
"I've changed my mind," said Gubbs. leaning out and
ppeaking- in a low voice, to defeat the intentions of Mrs.
Gubbs, who was looking. "I dreamt I killed Tarbut an'
it's give me such a fright that I've resolved not to fight."
"That's all right." said Larkins, briskly, "dreams al
ways go by contraries."
"Well, there ain't much comfort in that." said Gubbs,
who was anxious to get back to his warm bed, sharply.
"You dress yourself and come down," said Larkins.
imperiously, "you ought to be ashamed of yourself after
all the trouble I'm taking on your behalf."
Mr. Guhhs rubbed his eyes and pondered. "What's the
towel for?" he demanded suspiciously.
"Rub you down with after you've bathed," said the
other.
making that the period of the play, but !
by degrees I evolved the idea of an of- ;
flcial telegraph office in Richmond dur- i
ing the siege, and then the other mci- :
dents began to group themselves i
around this episode."
"There is, then, no historic basis for !
this theme.'' he was asked.
"None at all," quickly responded the
author. "During the New York run
and even yet I have a note on the pro- j
gramme explicitly disclaiming any at- ,
tempt to be historically accurate in the
play. It is pure fiction, and I don't
know that even the faintest resem- |
blance to this telegraph office existed
In Richmond. I gained some knowledge i
of the manner of doing things from an I
ex-Confederate official, and also
learned that they had a few breech
loading rifles late in the war, which en
abled me to introduce the scene where ;
the colored man bites off the bullets in
order to save the life of the spy hero." j
"Is that Incident absolutely neces- j
sary?"
"No; the act could be ended in an
other way, but the scene is effective, i
and then you see it enables me to make
out a better case for Dumont, or Cap
tain Thorne, as the spy calls himself.
In Richmond. * He refuses under the
circumstances to profit by the fact thnt
the builds have been extracted, and
tells the officer in command that his
guns have been tampered with."
"Which exhibition of manliness prob- |
ably wins the admiration and sympa- j
thy* of the other characters on the stage
and also of the audience," interjected
the reporter.
"Exactly so. And that reminds me
that I have been a little surprised by
the view most people take of army
spies. To my mind there is nothing
disreputable about this duty It is a |
recognized branch of army service, ex- ]
ceedingly dangerous, but not neces- I
sarily dishonorable. Why, monuments j
have been erected to spies!" exclaimed
Mr. Gillette with enthusiasm.
"But how about the social side of the
mattei*?"
"Well, In 'Secret Service' the spy
hero relinquishes his commission and
refuses to act when it .is made to ap- j
pear that he has taken "a dishonorable I
advantage of his social opportunities. |
That sets him rirrht in that particular." j
"How did 'Secret Service 1 come to be |
written at last after so many years of j
mental incubation?" Mr. Gillette was ;
asked.
"It Just happened all at once and
wilhout any premeditation," replied the
actor. "We were preparing 'Too Much
Johnson' for production, and had put
it aside for a little rest. You know I
there can be too much rehearsal. Dur- i
ing the interval, I roughly sketched the]
first act of 'Secret Service,' and, meet- j
ing Mr. Frohman, who was on the eve |
of going to Europe, told him that I
thought I had a good idea for a war

He led the way down to the beach, and ignoring the
looks of aversion which Mr. Gubbs bestowed upon the sil
ver sea, stood by while he disrobed and peacefully plied
his way over the shingle to the edge of the water. It was
a bright morning, but somewhat chill, and Mr. Gubbs
breathless gasplngs furnished an excellent clew to the
temperature of the water. , , .
â¢ f How do you feel?" inquired Mr. Larkins anxiously^
as he rubbed him down.
"I feel bad," said the other, shivering.
"You'll feel better when you've had your run, said
Larkins, cheerfully. ,

him offensively, and rubbing himself furiously with the
towel. , Â
"Your run," repeated Larkins, sternly. You don t want
your coat. See, hold that. And mind, I don't want you
to go running like a steam engine, or a runaway horse.
"I wasn't goin' to," said Gubbs.
"Just trot easy." continued the other, "for about half
a mile. Go as far as that gate over there, then rest two
minutes, and trot back again."
His manner was so dictatorial that Mr. Gubbs, re
membering in time his scene at the Three Fishers, swal
lowed something he was going to sayâ and it was nearly
strong enough to choke himâ and set off at a f trange,
weird gait toward the indicated goal. He reached it at
last, and, after a very Wong two minutes, started back
again, in response to the semaphore-like appeals of tho
enthusiastic Larkins.

latter, as his victim, puffing and blowing, sat down on the
ground. "But I'll soon get you in trim, and you can keep
quiet about it. I don't want Bullock to know."
"Why not?" demanded Mr. Gubbs.
"Because he'd train Tarbut the same way." said Lar
kins, with a cunning grin. "Well, why shouldn't Tarbut
'aye a doing same as me?" said Mr. Gubbs, vindictively.
"Why should 'c be layin" in comfort In 'is bed while I'm
catchin' 'arm bathing* and killing myself running?"
"Don't you be a fool." said Larkins, affectionately,
patting him on the shoulder. "Come into my place when
you have time, and I'll put the gloves on with you a bit;
and be careful what you eat, mind, else you'll undo all
the good I've done you."
If it is possible for a man to expectorate sarcastically
Mr. Gubbs achieved that feat.
"Only two cups of tea with your breakfast," continued
Larkins, solemnly, "and no gravies for dinner, and I'll
Bend you in one pint of old ale every day free gratis."
The tensity of Mr. Gubbs' features relaxed, and he
Bmiled faintly as he rose and accompanied his friend back.
Larkins saw him to his door and after explaining fluently
to Mrs. Gubbs that her husband was training for a race,
gave her explicit instructions as to his diet and departed.
It was a source of much joy to Mr. Larkins. though he
was unable to persuade Gubbs to share in his feelings,
that Tarbut's trainer was satisfied with a less vigorous
system for his man. He let Tarbut off with a cold spong
ing on rising, and as Tarbut had his own ideas as to what
constituted a cold sponging, both parties were well pleased
with each other.
The businesÃ-like nature of these proceedings was
keenly appreciated by the inhabitants of the fishing quar
ter. Fights had happened before and doubtless would
again, but they were mere rough and tumble affairs, and
Over before any proper excitement could be wisked up.
The purse had steadily mounted up to 35 shillings, and the
betting varied from day to .lay.
Each man had his kno: of supporters and enthusiasm
had reached such a pitch that Gubbs, who was naturally
of a retiring disposition, had to take his matutinal tub
before quite a circle of admirers. Opposition on the part
of the ladles was balked by continuing to refer to tho
affair as a race, though Mrs. Gubbs, who got up one.
morning to see her man run, went home in a slate of mind
bordering upon stupefaction.
An uneasy feeling was caused by the anxiety of the
excellent Mr. Morgan to discover the time and place of
meeting. No information was afforded Him, and as he
had indignantly denied any intention of giving the alarm,
the gentlemen interested were much exercised as to the
reasons for his curiosity.
The battle was fixed for a Saturday evening, the two
trainers, aiter much wordy warfare, having selected a
site which Mr. Larkins insisted had been made purposely
by nature, with a view to affairs of the kind. Lofty cliffs
hid it from view, and the ground itself consisted of turf
so soft and spongy that Larkins predicted that Tarbut
would bounce up from it like an India-rubber ball. The
performers expressed themselves as satisfied, though their
regardlepsnf ss in the matter of thanks for the trouble
which had been taken over the arrangements formed food
for conversation for the trainers all the way home.
The boats got in early Friday afternoon with their
fish. The catch was small and soon disposed of, and then
the attentive trainers, reserving their men from admirers
who were feeling their arms and putting leading questions
as to their wind and state of mind, sent them indoors with
concise instructions as to how they were to spend the last
evening. Larkins officiously sent his man off for a short,
sharp walk after his tea, and later on going to the quay
found that Bullock had given his man trie same instruc
tions.

kinÂ«.
"It is, though," said the old fisherman, peering
through screwed up eyes. "They've made it up through
old Peter, that's wot they've done. He's been talking at
'em and getting at 'em, and now there won't be no fight.'
His disappointed auditors groaned in chorus. 'W on t

don't think me and my friend Bullock here are going to
slave three weeks for nothing, do you?"
"There won't be no fight," repeated the old man.
"Look how loving they are! All three of "em as close to
gether as sweethearts."
The advancing trio certainly bore out the old man s
words to the letter Mr. Peter Morgan was in the center,
and appeared to be half embracing his companions.
"Why. they can hardly walk," said Bullock, "they've
been too far."

"Yes, that's what It is," said Larkins, in a hollow
voice.
"Seems to me," said the small boy slowly, "that
they'vev'ad a bit of a scarf already."
The crowd with bated breath stepped out to meet
them, Larkins and Bullock leading. It was evident tfcat
the two heroes were clinging to Mr. Morgan more for
support than from any motives of affection, and it was
no less evident that the lad^s remark as to a bit of a
scarf was capable of a wide interpretation. In a few min
utes both parties were face to face, and the two trainers
gazing at their charges speechless with indignation.
"Which is Gubbs?" demanded Mr. Larkins at last in
an unnatural voice.
The figure on Mr. Morgan's right arm managed to
open an eye and to twist its swollen lips into something
intended for a smile.
"What 'aye you been doing?" vociferated the incensed
landlord.
"Fightin'," said Gubbs, speaking with some difficulty,
"it's all over now. It was a draw and we'r* goln" to halve
the money between us."
"Oh, are you?" said Larkine, bitterly; "well, you won't
have a d d ha'penny of it. What do you mean by it?

FAMOUS JEWEL
ROBBERIES IN ENGLAND
THERE is a remarkable, if some
what morbid, fascination attach
ing: to gigantic jewel robberies â
like that, for instance, recently
perpetrated at the expense of the Dow
ager Duchess of Sutherland. That a
man should coolly walk into a railway
carnage and in less than one minute
annex a fortune, such as not one person
in ten thousand- attains after a lifetime
of toil, is sufficiently startling. But the
thing becomes amazing when one re
flects upon the time, patience, thor
oughness and resourcefulness expended
upon the successful carrying out of
these colossal criminal coups.
Take, for example, the theft of the
Countess of Dudley's jewels at Pad
dington Station in December, 1574. This
case was almost on all fours with the
Duchess of Sutherland's, and although
the thieves were never captured it was
proved conclusively that the robbery
had been planned six months pre
viously, and that during that entire
period the Duchess had been shadowed,
night and day, by one or other of the
confederates engaged in it. The value
of the gems was at first stated to be
$250,000, but subsequently this was re
duced by about one-half.
On January 15, 1871, all London was
talking of a remarkable outrage and
robbery perpetrated on the previous
day. A Mr. Parkes, employed by the
great jewelry firm .of London & Ryder,
proceeded, by appointment, to a house
in Upper Berkeley street with abuut
$30,000 worth of gems in a bag. Di
rectly he entered he was set upon by
twer persons, a man and a woman, who
seized, bound and chloroformed him
and decamped with the valuables.
Luckily the victim recovered his senses
an hour or two later and a hue and
cry v. ere at once raised.
Both culprits were eventually ar
rested and the man received a sentence
of eight years' penal servitude. The
woman, his wife, was acquitted, mainly
owing to the eloquence of Montagu
Williams, who defended her. Only
about $4000 worth of the stolen property
was ever recovered. A somewhat simi
lar robbery, it will be remembered, was
planned last year at a hotel in Brighton.
Luckily it was unsuccessful.
Hatton Garden, as may well be imag
ined, has been the seat of several no
torious diamond robberies. One of the
earliest and biggest occurred on March
26, 1876, when Messrs. Williams & Son,
manufacturing jewelers, lost gems to
the value of $125,000. The thieves ob
tained entrance to the premises at dusk
on a Saturday evening, opened the
safes with duplicate keys and carried
away all the most costly articles, things
of lesser value being left untouched.
Many people will . doubtless be able
to recall the daring robbery per
petrated at Hatton Garden Postoffice,
on November 16, 1881. Shortly after
dusk, and while what was then known
as the "Continental Diamond Mail"

."Must ha' been," said a dejected voice. >( .
"After that there was twelve more rounds, continuea
the narrator; "sometimes Tarbut had the best of It. ana
sometimes Gubbs. Both men were very determined and
fought very fair. It was good, solid, hard hitting, and
they were bruised all over before they d finished.
Once Gubbs give Tarbut a blow over the heart, and I
thought he wouldn't get up to time."
"I wouldn't if you hadn't blowed water into my face
out of that puddle," said Tarbut.
"It was a most disgusting spectacle," said Mr. Peter
Morgan, hurriedly.
"Seems to me," began Lrarkins, ferociously.
"Two fine, strong men, stripped to the waist, hard as
nails, knocking each other about for money," said Mr.
Morgan. "They're never going to fight any more. I made
'em promise they wouldn't. They're good friends now.
Ain't you, lads?"
With an utter disregard for the feelings of the by
standers the two men shook hands.
"And though I regard fighting with horror," concluded
Mr. Morgan, beaming on them, "I think that as It was a
bargain you should divide the purse between 'em."
â¢They won't get a farthing of it," said Mr. Larkins,
explosively. 'Unless you like to give it to *em out of your
own pocket."
"Me?" said Mr. Morgan, opening his eyes. "Why?"
"Ask yourself." said Mr. Larkins, pointedly. "I should
cay if any man ever 'ad 35 shillings worth of sport all to

Peter Morgan. "
The peacemaker sighed, and, turning, led his charges
gently away. The crowd watched them as far as the

selves by force from their guide and friend, crossed the
road and followed them in.
was being made up, the gas was sud
denly turned o^ at the meter and the
whole place plunged in d ,rkness. At
first it was thought to be an accident.
But, on lights being brought, it was
seen that the two registered mail bags,
containing cut and uncut stones to the
total value of $200,000, had disappeared.
The robbery was skilfully planned
and cleverly executed, and all subse
quent efforts to recover the diamonds
or apprehend the thieves proved fruit
less. The last great robbery associated
with the "Gai'den" took place on Sep
tember 13, 1894, when Herr Spyzer, an
Antwerp diamond merchant, was de
coyed into a L gus office, attacked by
three men, chloroformed and robbed of
gems valued a* $100,000.
Early in February, 1877, occurred the
great jewel robbery at Battle Abbey,
Sussex, when gems to the value of be
tween $40,000 and $50,000, the property
of the Duchess of Cleveland, were car
ried away. In this case the coup was
effected while his Grace and the
Duchess were in the drawing-room en
tertaining a few friends, and the serv
ants were in the kitchen at supper.
The articles stolen were chiefly pres
ents; one of them, a magnificent neck
lace of diamonds, rubies and emeralds,
being a gift of the Queen to the
Duchess, who v as a bridesmaid at her
Majesty's vedding. Curiously enough,
one case of jewelry, containing gems
of far greater value than any of those
taken away, was overlooked by the
robbers in their hurry.
On the 19th of November of the same
year a peculiarly heartless robbery was
perpetrated at Halstead Place, near
Sevenoaks. The newly married Earl
a.id Countess of Aberdeen had gone
there on tl eir !.oneymoon, taking with
them the whole of their beautiful
bridal presents. The published descrip
tions of the costliness of these had
evidently attracted the thieves, for
hardly had the young couple reached
their destination ere the bulk of the
offerings, valued at about $25,000, were
anvexed by burglars, who forced an
entitnce while the Earl. and Countess
were at dinner.
Reference has already been made to
the Hatton Garden Postoffice robbery,
which took place on November I*s. ISBI.
Just eighteen days later, on a Sunday,
the biggest jewel robbery of this cen
tury was effected at Brynkinalt. the
seat of Lord Hill Trevor, near Chirk,
North Wales. The coup was brought
off while the family were at church,
and the total value of the property car
ried away exceeded $300,000. In this
case two servants were arrested, but
they were discharge* almost immedi
ately, and the mystery remains un
elucidated to this day.
Another valuable haul was that made
at Leigh Court, near Bristol, the seat
of Sir Philip Miles, on December 18,
1892. In this case the family were at
dinner. The jewels, worth $150,000,
were safe at 7 o'clock. An hour later
they had vanished. Yet another "din
ner-hour robbery" was that effected at
the expense of Baron Schroeder of^
I Woolerton House, Cheshire, where
$15,000 worth were taken. This occurred
on March 16, ISÂ£3, and on August 1 of
; the same year there took place at The
Hatch, near Maidenhead, the extraor
dinary and mysterious robbery which
j deprived the Countess of TVilton of ,a
! number of priceless heirlooms and
I family relics.
Most people can recall the circum
stances surrounding the theft, by a
i trick, of Mrs. Langtry's jewels. A
; man presented at her bankers a forged
[ order for their delivery, walked away;
with the box and was never seen or
heard of again.
But, after all is said and done, all
i modern jewel robberies sink into utter
\ insignificance when compared with th*
â¢ theft of the world-famous Tavernier
. diamond. It was valued, at a moderate
| estimate, at $10,000,000, and was stolen
1 from the Garde Meuble, Paris, In 1792.
' "What became of it is a mystery. But
it is generally believed to have been cut
into two or three pieces, each being
i afterward sold as a separate diamond.

YALE'S BAD DEBT AGENCY.
Collegians are furious because, they
say, an attempt is being made to sully
the fair name of their Alma Mater.
It is veil known that a college man
spends considerable money. A Yale man
as a rule spends more rather than less.
Yale men, even those who have large
allowances, are prone to spend their
incomes before the month is half over.
Then it is either borrow from friends
or resort to the money-lenders.
It is easy enough for Yale students
to borrow money or to get goods on
credit.
Sometimes, often, it is said, it Is not
so easy for tradesmen and lenders to

To fill a long-felt want a Yale Bad

Mrs. Harris was the widow of Daniel
Harris. She believed she was the
third white woman who came across
th.<- plains in an ox team to California.
She knew James Marshall, the finder of
gMKI in California,, before he sr.w
â¢â "â¢â  Cblpma, and her husband and she
knew General Ulysses S. Grant when
he was at Benlciaâ a modest and un
promising captain in the United States
army. She was a genial person even
in her old age and days of weakness.
;.She loved to dwell in the past and to
recount her extraordinary adventures
in California long before the Americans
came. She became a cigarette smoker
from her association with the Mexicans
m her early life, and in her last days a
â¢ giff of a few packages of anild dear
ie Â©ties' or a bag of smoking tobacco
would elicit a tale of adventure or a
â  thrilling chapter of State history that
was always worth attentive hearing.
Mrs Harris was born in Gloucester.
Mass., in 1820 and her relatives were
whalers and fisherfolk. In 1834. when a
:-: : girl of 14, her father gave up fishing,
â  .and hearing of the possibilities of for
tune on the frontier of Missouri and
â Illinois, in those days, started for the
â â¢â¢ West. Chicago was the objective point.
They went there by the Erie Canal to
Buffalo, and were three weeks going on
a boat from Buffalo to Chicago via the
lakes. Chicago was at that time a
place of 3000 or 5000 people. In 1838,
whin Mrs. Harris 1 father became con
vinced that Chicago was on the decline
and would retrograde into a wild West
ern village, the family moved to St.
Louis which was then 'a fast-growing
city of some 12,000 people. There Mrs.
Harris was married in 1840. She was
20 years old at the time, and her young
husband had had letters from an uncle,
who was a sailor, saying that there was
a fortune to be made on the Pacific
lin" with the Indians for
furs. The young people talked over a

before Marshall found the gold in Sut

traders among the Spanish and the In
dians, were about to start from Fort
Leavenworth for California. When the
party was made up for the journey in
April, IS4I, there were twenty-two men
and two women in the party.
A fortnight before her death Mrs.
Harris told the story of her remarkable
vicissitudes in the West, particularly
Californiaâ in the following way:
"We were from April 11 until Sep
tember 28 in going from Fort Leaven
worth to what is now Colfax, Cal. We
hired a man at Fort Leavenworth. who
had been across the plains once, for our
guide. I believe he was to get $300 for
his work, and he expected to become a
sailor when he reached the coast.
"Our first mishap was on the Platte
River, where a young man named Daw
son was captured by the Indians and
stripped of his clothing. They let him
go then and then followed him, so that
without knowing it he acted as their
guide to our camp. The redskins sur
rounded our camp and remained all
night, but whpn daylight showed them
our strength they went away. We had
a picket guard about our camp nearly
every night we were on the plains, and
we saw literally millions of buffaloes.
Many a time the galloping of immense
herds of the beasts across the prairies
sounded like distant thunder.
"We left our wagons this side of Salt
Lake and finished our journey on horse
back and drove our cattle. At one place
the Indians surrounded us, armed with
their bows and arrows, but my hus
band and four other men leveled their
guns at the chief and made him order
his Indians out of arrow range. Be
fore we had been two months on the
plains we had become so used to hard
ships, had seen four of our party wel
come death from sickness, and had had
such frights at threatened death by the
savages, that we lost a good part of the
natural alarm one has when environed
by danger.
"We crossed the Sierra Nevadas at
the headwaters of the San Joaquin
River. On the Ist of September we
camped on the summit. It was my
twenty-first birthday. That day one
of the priests in our party drank at a
spring of clear, cold water. It was
strong alkali water, however, and he
came near dying in the next few days,
and it ruined his stomach so that he
lived only a year. We had a difficult
time to find a way down the mountains.
At one time I was left alone for nearly
half a day, and as I was afraid of In
dians I sat all the while with my six
week-old baby in my lap on the back
of my horse, which was a fine race ani
mal.

cousin and a man named Jones had
strayed from the company while in the
mountains and we supposed they were
dead, but my husband discovered their
tracks and reported that they were
surely alive. At one place I was so
weak I could not stand, and I lay on
the ground while Mr. Harris went out
and killed a deer. We were then near
the Sepulveda ranch, which was close
to what is now Martinez. Mr. Jones,
one of the supposed dead men, and one
of Sepulveda's Indians rode into our
camp and brought with them some
farina for me. We arrived at Sepul
veda's on the 14th day of October.
"We met General Sutter at Alva
rado's hacienda, and in December we
went up with Sutter in a leaky rowboat
to his fort. We were fifteen days mak
ing the trip. The boat was manned by
Indians, and Sutter instructed them to
swim to the shore with me and the
child if the boat should capsize. That
is only a sample of the chances we took
with our lives every day in those pio

game, cooked and ate it and then

building was a great barnlike affair,
and the household equipment the very

he could develop into an industry or

WOMAN SUFFRAGE IN COLORADO
By MRS. X- f- G. PATTERSON. President of the NoQ-Partisao Colorado Equal Suffrage (Association
DENVER, Nov. 25.â Colorado is the State in which equal suffrage
has found the warmest support and achieved its greatest success. In the
East women have voted for schools and in some remote cases for muni
cipal officials. There were three women members of :he last Legisla
ture, and they took an active part in the proceedings. Women have even
outnumbered the men in a Colorado election. This occurred in April of
last year, when municipal elections were held all over the State. Two
years before the women of Denver oragnized a Civic Federation for the
election of good men to office. This federation became an active politi
cal machine. It was non-partisan by its own platform. It recognized no
creed or nationality. Its avowed object was "to investigate the condi
tion and needs of the city and to promote by education and active co
operation a higher public spirit and a better social order; to separate city
and county affairs from State and national politics; to endeavor to se
cure the nomination and election of competent and trustworthy persons
for public office," etc.
This was the fourth election in which women had taken part in
Colorado, and they were eminently successful.
Emboldened by the results of their interference in municipal affairs,
the women have gone into matters of national policy, and in the elec
tion last week they threw their influence with the friends of silver, ac
cording to Mrs. Thomas M. 'Patterson (or Mrs. Katherine A. G. Patter
son, as she appears in public affairs), the President of the Non-Partisan
Colorado Equal Suffrage Association.
Here is what she has to say of women's influence in Colorado
politics:
Sseclal to The Sunday Call.
WOMEN have been voting In
Colorado since 1895, and have
yet made no permanent lm.
pression upon the politics of
the State. .
It is claimed that no ap
preciable effect of this enfranchisement
could be expected in a time so short,
since Intricate political methods of
long established organizations even
when found very objectionable are not
to be overcome by the efforts of tyros
in a single generation. In muniolpal
affairs, it is true, woman's vote has as
sisted in a triumph over tyrannical ma
chine rule in more than one election,
and it is acknowledged that through
the leaven of a reorganization influence
has begun its work, which, like all
elemental processes that are to build
up the new upon the decay of the old,
Is the task of more than a day.
In the contest just closed between the
Indians and selling them to the trading
agents for the Astor Company and
some English buyers, who sailed up
and down the coast for this purpose.
So we started for Oregon. I have been
told by some California historians that
I was one of the first white women to
make the journey which was danger
ous in those days I can assure you.
There were fourteen men in our party.
We went up the east side of the Sac
ramento River for about forty miles,
where we crossed over by swimming
our horses and cattle, of which the
crowd had quite a number. It was
there I first witnessed the killing of an
Indian. The men were all out trying
to drive the stocl- into the river and I
was left alone in camp, when several
nude Indians ame in, and as I thought
they intended to steal I stepped* to a
tree where the guns were. As they
approached me I warned them away.
"I marvel now how I ever dared so
much, and my grandchildren cannot
believe I was in my senses to have
stayed as I did in such a barbarous
country. My husband saw from where
he was that Indians were in camp and
sent one of the men whom we called
Bear Dawson to protect me. He was a
reckless young man and as he rode up
he ordered the Indians to go, but they
drew their bows on him and reversed
the order. Then he drew his pistol and
killei one of them and the rest fled.
The Indian fell within six feet of me.
After that my husband got one of the
Indians to swim across the river ana
tow the canoe in which I and the child
were sitting. The Indian took me all
right because he knew they hua theii
guns .bearing on him.
"Do I remember the news of the
finding of the first gold in California?
I never could forget that if I should
live a thousand years. We were living
in Napa at the time. My husband was
foreman for a Mexican ranchman and
by that time managed to get a living.
One night when Mr. Harris came home
he said that one of the men who work
ed for Mr.Vallejo up on Sonoma Creek
was terribly excited, and said they had
found bits of gold in the sawmill sluice
up at Coloma, and that the canyons and
gulches up that way were full of gold
nuggets. Mr. Harris and I had been
fooled so many times by exaggerated
stories in California that we gave the
subject only passing comment. We
thought no more about the stories un
til a sailor came to our house on his
way to Sutter's Fort a few days later.
He said that his brother-in-law had
seen some gold down at San Jose that
had been washed out by several of
Sutter's workmen. He had quit sail

Then the news of the gold find came

among the willful confusion of tickets
offered for the people's ballots.
As to the conditions of the participa
tion of women in Colorado campaigns
it is to be recorded that they are sub
ject during its course to no rude asso
ciations. In the stress of the partisan
struggle that necessarily precedes an
election, women of public Bpirit and
good position are chosen to direct the
political meetings of women, and It is
the rule that from the precinct parlor
meetings that are preliminary to pri
maries to the parlor headquarters kept
open exclusively for women citizens,
their meetings closely resemble their
accustomed club assemblies.
There are. besides, women's purely
political clubs of every party, whose
seasons of activity coincide with cam
paign seasons. During these times
in. When a month more had passed
and we began to see for ourselves nug
gets of gold as large as peas in the
hands of people, my husband believed
that the stories of the riches in the
mountains were after all true. He
started with several other men to walk
to Coloma. In three weeks he was home
again with $1300 in gold and silver. He
was as crazy as every one else by that
time and I was about the same. Then
he fixed the babies and me more com
fortably, stocked the house with pro
visions and started off to the gold dig
gings again. The whole country was
literally insane with excitement, and
when autumn came around a white
man or a white boy, who was at all
able-bodied, was not to be found for
miles and miles around Napa, for they
had all gone seeking gold. Prices for
everything we ate or used rose ten and
twelve times their former value, and it
was often hard work to get provisions
at any price, because what man was
going to fool awa- his time with ham
and pork and calico when he could pick
up gold nuggets all day long up at the
diggings?
"You can have no idea how plentiful
gold was in that region all of a sud
den, and its very plentifulness made it
such a delirious, dreamy state that
none of us realized what a marvelous
epoch we were living in.
"Did we know Marshall, the finder of
the first gold? Yes. I recalled, when he
became known as the first gold miner in
California, that we knew him when we
were at Suttej "s. He was a dozen years
older than either my husband or my
self, and came to California a few
weeks before we did. I remember we
knew him as 'Jersey,' and he called us
'Yanks.' He was a herder or vaquero
for General Sutter's cattle when we
first knew him. I saw him in 1851, when
the gold fever was raging, and he was
worth probably $60,000 or $70,000 by his
gold operations. He might have been
one of the greatest millionaires the
world ever knew, but he had no ability
for accumulating wealth. He had no
ideas above the simple duties of life
and caring for a herd of cattle or a
band of horses. I saw him again in
18T3, when he was old and poorly
dressed and in poverty. He just laughed
about the way he had sat about and let
men get millions of dollars, but he did
think California ought to give him more
honor for what he had done for the
commerce of the world.
"My husband came home in April,
1850, for the third time. He had made
over $30,000 in digging gold, and we felt
as rich as any Astor or Vanderbilt ever
did. Just at that time my husband
broke his leg, and that was the begin
ning of our hard luck again. There was
only one doctor within sixty miles, and
he was a poor one. We paid him $1500
also many a friendly tete-a-tete upon
the situation or brief persuasive plea
for candidate or measure is heard in
some quiet corner of hall or library,
where people meet in amiable mood at
social receptions.
In the great political mass meeting
the proportion of women in attendance
is no greater than in the campaigns
before their opinions began to be
counted at the ballot box.
If, in all this Colorado women, al
though graciously allowed to agree
with masculine managers, have yet lit
tle choice in the construction of the
tickets placed before them or in the di
rection of campaign matters, they are
content, through the still small voice
of the ballot, to do their part with what
patience they may toward the coming
of the better times, when, even after
their own day, perhaps only after gen
erations of use, woman's prentice hand
ehall have come to be often the guid
ing hand and the beneficent wisdom of
"the eternal womanly" shall have been
found as indispensable in the State as
in the home.
For the present the registration of
new voters in Colorado is much larger
than at any time since woman's vote
four years ago was said to have "re
deemed the State" from the dangers
that were threatened by the possible
success of one of the gubernatorial can
didates. As is the ease with all citi
zens, the number of women voting va
ries with the interest felt in the issues
that are at each election to be consid
ered.
School questions are woman's great
est concern. But on account of the
entire absence of the often predicted
evil effects of the ballot in woman's
hands, and because of the widening of
her outlook and the healthful develop
ment in good women of their sense of
responsibility for the public good, the
number of the new citizens who reg
ister and vote is on the whole steadily
increasing from year to year. Among
the women of Colorado who thorougn
ly believe in both the justice and ths
expediency of equal suffrage are a host
of the best women of the State; mov
ing spirits in the work of philanthropy,
reform and education; unquestioned so
cial arbiters, intellectual leaders of
thought and the women of supreme
common sense who guide the new, ef
ficient club work.
to look after my husband for four
weeks, and were glad to have his serv
ices at that price. My husband never
went back to the mines, for by the time
he was able to endure hardship the
mining field was swarming with rest
less, aggressive, wild miners, and he
felt that he had no more chances there
to get rich.
"In June, 1851, Mr. Harris bought a
herd of cattle from Salvador Vallejo
and drove them down to Benicia, where
the military garrison was located. I
went along with my four children in a
wagon drawn by an ox team. The cat
tle were butchered and the beef sold
at Benicia, but it was a poor invest
ment. We lived at Benicia for over a
year. While there we became well ac
quainted with Captain U. S. Grant,
who had come there from the Mexican
war. He and my husband were about
of an age. We little imagined that the
quiet, modest, chunky man would be
the great American general in twelve
years more. Captain Grant was then
a smoker, but cigars were too expensive
in those crazy gold days, and he con
tented himself with a briarwood pipe.
He was a good card player, and I re
member that pedro was his favorite
game. He was very poor then, and I
recall that although he had to be care
ful of every cent he spent of his small
salary, he took little interest in the
alluring stories that men down from
the mines with gold dust used to sit
about the saloons at Benicia and tell
day after day.
"We lived in Monterey for six years
and my husband dfalt in cattle and
sheep, which were shipped and driven
to the mining towns. I have seen hun
dreds of fair steers that brought $500
in gold each in those days, but when
you remember what exorbitant prices
had to be paid for feed and for ranch
men there was not such great profit in
the business, besides everything we ate
and wore was put on a gold mining
basis. My husband paid a common
vaquero $200 a month in gold for three
years, and my calico dresses used to
cost $35 and $40 each in those days. We
sold hundreds of pounds of butter at $2
a pound, and some at $4 a pound, but
that was too slow a way of making
money in those extraordinary times,
and we did not make a quarter as much
butter as we might have done.
"Up to 1859 I had enough personal in
cidents to fill a book. I once rode sev
enty-five miles on horseback in one
day and carried a one-year old child in
front of m^. I was going to see a sick
woman in San Jose, and I fainted when
they helped me off the horse.
"Mr. Harris' health began to fall in
1859, so we started for the dry, hot cli
mate of Arizona and New Mexico. The
palmy days of gold mining for poor
folks were over by that time. The
mining companies with their combined
capital, science and machinery were
beginning their era then. In 1860 we
were in camp in Arizona, near where
Benson has since grown up. We heard
stories of massacres by the Apaches
and Pimas once in a while, but we had
no idea they were as bold as they were.
One October day, when the men in the
camp were out foraging for fuel, and
we four women and seven children were
left in camp, a boy came running ex
citedly into the tent and told us that a
gang of Apaches was sneaking around
among the chaparral in the foothills a
! mile from our camp. We had four car
', bines in camp and we women quickly
loaded them, and put the ammunition,
Jiorns and belts about. Then we all
hid ourselves as best we could. We had
1 no time to plan the manner of secret- %
I ing ourselves. It was as horrible an
i experience as I ever knew in all my
! days among the redskins. There was
i a small cave near by. It was hid by
t.ill chaparral, and we women, each
with a gun in hand and leading or
carrying a child, ran swiftly for the
cave. The larger girls started to run
; with us, but they changed their minds
â¢ and ran into the brush to hide.
"In a moment the Indians came leap
ing toward the cave. We could see
i them on the way. Each of us women
: got behind a boulder at the mouth of
the shallow cave, resolved to deliber
ately shoot down every Indian that .
; came that way before we were killed.
i The Indians robbed the camp of all the
! money and the few valuables there,
and started back to their own camp,
i In some way they saw the bie girls
! hiding in the chaparral and started
j after'them. We heard the girls scream
jas they ran. closely followed by the
' Apaches. My girl, Jennie, aged 12
' years, tripped and fell in the bush.
i while the arrows fell thick about her. â¢
i I can hear now the screams and piteous
' veils she uttered as she begged the
j savages for her life. But none of us
' dared move from our place.
"Then the screams subsided and we
i saw the Indian* going away from the
i chaparral on a run. We watched for
! a time that seemed an age before we
dared move or make a noise. We got
back to camp after nightfall. All that
! night we searched for my Jennie's
body, but she had recovered from her
injuries so that she was able, to walk
about in a demented state. "We came
I upon her a mile away the next morn
! ing. She was lying on the ground, and
I our horror wh^-n we pickpd her up is
! unspeakable. She had been scalDed
I and her shoulders slashed. The men in
camp got other men in camps near by
to form a posse and for a week they
vainly trailed the escaping Indians.
But the latter knew the country . well
and "ot away into the mountains.
'That experience was enough of
Arizona for us. We came back to
California at once. Our poor Jennie
never recovered from her awful scalD
wound. She suffered excruciating pain
in her head as if she had acute neu
ralgia whenever the weather was cold
or damp, and she had chronic head
aches under the skull where the scalp
was cut away. She was ill for four
years and gradually sank into her
grave. My husband died in 1863 at Los
Angeles.
"During the period from 1864 to 1875
I had a dairy in Santa Barbara and a
small sheep ranch in Santa Barbara
County. I reared and educated my
children and grandchildren by. that.
A fire destroyed my home, barns and
my best heifers in 1875, and I have been
poor ever since.
"There, do you not think I have had
a life filled with remarkable vicissi
tudes? Often as I get to thinking
about strange scenes I have witnessed
and the extraordinary phases of life I
have participated in. I wonder if I
really am one and the same person who
has experienced this and seen a great
State grow in one lifetime as has Cali
fornia."

to our colors. Ever since then we have
been busy collecting our bets. In fact I
have been so busy collecting that I have
not had time to pay those I lost. For,
of course, I hedged, which would lead
one to suppose that I both won and lost.
Not I. 1 have already pocketed my win
nings and shall not cheat any one out
of theirs. But I'll owe it to them. 1
could live. on the interest of what I owe
now, so I'm sure of a cheerful old age.
We had our seats in the front row of
the University Club section. The sec
ond half the playing was all down at our
end so we had an excellent view of the
game. Dick said my remarks were so in
telligent that I surprised most of the men.
The other girls looked wise. One would
never have guessed that they didn't know
a fullback from a quarterback. I think
Bobby Eyre divined It. Helen said some
thing or other that made it impossible
for her best friend to accuse her of un
derstanding the game. But Bobby can be
trusted not to tell.
Everybody was there. From where we
sat we could see all that there was to
be seen. The Hopkins party sat three
rows back of us. Helen, Edna and Caro
Crockett wore the cardinal. It was very
b'-comlng. Bobby Eyre and Lawrence
Van Winkle were with them.
Marie Oge was there with Alf Williams.
Cupid has been doing some good work
in that quarter if Dame Gossip speaks
whereof she knows. Forsooth I know
not. but 'tis averred on all sides that
Marie has turned a willing ear to Cupid's
pleading. Marie looks as well as ever,
but Dick says that Mr. Williams no
longer eats three good meals a day. And
when a man's appetite fails he is either
in love or a victim of indigestion.
Mr and Mrs. Lester, Daisy Van Ness,
Howard Veder and Harry Stetson sat
within hearing distance of us; that is. it
would have been hearing distance under
ordinary circumstances, but in that noise
and din it was impossible to hear your
neighbor think.

ADELINA PATTI
WILL MARRY AGAIN
LONDON. Nov. 19-- Aa Â«" ,n
Patti has fixed the first week in
February for her marriage to
Baron Kederstrom. â¢
ADELINA PATTI is about to take
jnto herself a young and
charming husband. At least it
Is to be supposed that he Is
young, for where a woman of
55 puts on the matrimonial yoke and
for the third time the object of her
choice is pretty sure to be some years
her junior.
a woman's heart is always young.
That the Baron Kederstrom is
charming goes without saying. He is
a Norseman, perfect in physique, at
tractive in his manner, a gifted vocal
ist, handsome, indeed, quite a para
gon in every particular, according to
the diva's description. What more
would you have?
For some time gossip has been busy
with the ever-young Adellna's affairs.
But a few weeks since that meddle
some old Dame Rumor violently cir
culated the report that Patti was
about to link her fortunes with a mem
ber of the "smart" set, who had been
rather conspicuous as a member of her
house parties at Craig-y-Nos in Wales,
and who had been dangling his fascin
ating person about her for some time.
Curiosity was piqued to such an ex
tent that the young man in question
was besieged with interrogations, par
ticularly on the part of the American
newspapers, or, to be more correct, an
American newspaper, as to who he was,
what he was and why he was. Also,
when he was going to marry Mme.
Patti, how much she was going to set
tle on him, and whether he intended to
allow her to give any more "farewell"
concerts.
London talked and talked and the
ripple spread into a mighty surge.
When Patti herself stepped forward
and announced her approaching mar
riage â not to the young man who had
been well-nigh paralyzed with the
wt-alth of interrogation that had been
showered upon him â but toÂ» the lucky
Baron Kederstrom.
Adelina Patti was born in Madrid
February 19, 1843. Her father an Ital
ian, her mother Spanish, both of them
singers, it is not surprising that the
daughter should have inherited a voice
which has electrified two continents.
A stern determination, some might
call it obstinacy, has been one of her
most prominent characteristics through
life, and when she made up her mind
to have a thing all obstacles were
borne down before her will like wheat
before the reaper's scythe. She ex
hibited this trait in early age.
One night at a theater in an Ameri
can town, a small child occupied the
stage. Sho stood, making no move
ment, a strangely resolute look upon
her infantile face. Several times the
music started, the accompanist motion
ing to her to begin, but neither song nor
sound of any description issued from
her tightly compressed lips. Finally
some one from the wings approached
her.
After what appeared to be a rather
heated argument the some one retired.
reappearing in a moment with a hupe
doll in his arms. The little lady's face
broke forth into a pmile of heavenly
radiance, she clasped the doll in both
her arms and sang as no child ever
sang before.
This was Adelina Patti's first appear
ance before the public. Applause might
lurk in every corner of that house,
there mltfht be waiting for her any
number of bouquets and bon bons. but
unless she could have her beloved doll
to share it with her they mi^ht wait
until doomsday and she would not sing.
This child prodigy fortunately had
wise parents, and she was withdrawn
from the public to pursue her studies.
She did not appear again until May 14,
evidently wishes It even more than I do.
But Leontlne. and Ethel Keeney are go
ing, despite th" aching voids their ab
sence will create. V<\
Charlotte- Elllngwood and her friends

than a bowing acquaintance with the wee

Ollie, Josie and Mabel Loughborough

Therese Morgan gave Ollie a dinner last
week that was exceptionally enjoyable.
The decorations were autumn' leaves, and
their rich colorings lent a warm, delight
ful tint that was charming.

was to give her had to be indefinitely
postponed. Gertie's uncle, Mr. Murphy of
Han Jose, died, so the Carrolls and Whit

Mrs. Hopkins is going to give Ollie a
dinner on Tuesday night, to which we are

His WondÂ«rful Name.
The following is a true story told of a
Mr. Ottiwell Wood, who was a minister 1
of gospel, and whose son, John Wood, j
for many years chairman of the Board of
Inand Revenue, vouched for its correct
ness, says the Household Words, Lon- |
don. Mr. Wood had to appear as a wit- j
ness in a North Country assize court, and
was asked and gave his name in due
course. "What?" asked the Judge peev
ishly, being rather deaf. Mr. Wood re
peated his answer. "Can't hear you;
spell it out. "snapped the Judge. U,
3ouble T, I, double U, E. double L, double
LJ, double O, D." The Judge threw down
:ils pen in despair.
This is even a more remarkable name
than that of the late Admiral W. vV â¢
Wood, which the cadets at the Annapolis
Naval Academy, when he was an In
structor in mathematics there, always
Bvrote, "W cube. O square, D." f

1861, when she made her debut In Eng
land at the Royal Italian Opera. Her
success was instantaneous. From that
time she became famous.
During her second season in Paris,
the Marquis de Caux crossed her life.
He became a constant visitor at the
Pattis' and devoted to the prima donna
his undivided attention. That Adi?lina
was flattered by his attentions and re
turned in full his ardent admiration is
shown by the following conversation
which took place one evening at the
close of a performance of "La Travi
ata." Some of her friends had quitted
her dressing room. The Marquis re
mained behind. Adelina turned to him
and said:
"Now, Marquis, what Is the newest
gossip in Paris?"
"The newest," was the answer, "is
that we are engaged!"
The indescribable love light is said to
have animated her features, as with a
smile she said to the Marquis:
"And why not? I hope that would
not.be unpleatant to you?"
"No, surely not," the Marquis stam
mered. "I should be the happiest of
men if it were true."
Adelina, blushing sweetly, extended
her hand to the Marquis, exclaiming:
"And 1, too, should be happy."
And then true love began its rough,
tempestuous course.
The Marquis' mother considered that
her son was marrying beneath him
and withheld her consent.
Patti pere was not pleased with his
daughter's selection.
All this but helped to fan the flame,
: and Patti, resolute in her determina
i tion to wed the man she chose, fixed
1 July 29, 186S, as the day upon which the
j marriage ceremony should take place.
The first years of married life were
i blissfully happy.
About this time Patti reached the
! summit of her fame.
When she made her debut in St. Pe
tersburg orchestra seats sold for 100
rubles each, which is equal to about
! $78 40 of our money, and the flowers
! thrown upon the stage represented an
â  outlay of 6000 rublesâ over $4000.
Then Nicolini appeared upon the
I scene. He and his wife and five chil
'< dren occupied the villa adjoining
Patti's. 'Tis said it is best to begin with
a little diversion, and Patti took a most
| intense dislike to the tenor. She avoid-"*
| ed him on all occasions, and even re
i proached her husband for being his
j friend and admirer. But Nicolini fair
j ly dogged her footsteps, following her
!In ail her tours. The first expression
' that he gave of his love was one day
< when Patti and a companion were
Â«tr<'lling in the Petrowski Park. A
carriage drove up, Nicolini alighted and
placed a note in Patti's hand. It ex
pressed In most Impassioned words his
love.
Patti laughed most heartily over it,
and declared that even if she wished it
would be impossible to love the man.
Then Adelina began to treat the tenor
with less harshness than heretofore,
the displeasure that she felt at Nico-
Jini's character changing to compas
sion. From this stage it was but a
short step to love.
When the Marquis learned of his
wife's faithlessness he tried in every
way to separate the pair. Engagements
in which the two were to appear were
by him canceled and the mere mention
of Nicollni's name led to many a
stormy battle between the Marquis and
his wife.
However, it was impossible to sepa
rate the two.
From the Frai leln Lauw's account
of Patti's life at this period the' follow
ing excerpt is taken:
"At the close of the season in Mos
cow the Marquis heard that Nicolini
was on his way to St. Petersburg, hav
ing offered to make amends for break
ing his contract by taking part in
twelve performances without receiving
any salary therefor. As soon as he ar
rived in the Russian metropolis the
Marquis demanded that 'Romeo and
Juliet,' in which Nicolini was to sing
Romeo, be stricken from the repertoire,
and that the tenor should not appear
during the season with his wife.
"The management promised that the
Marquis' wishes should be respected,
but â under pressure, no doubt, of the
two artists â 'La Traviata' was an
nounced for Nicollni's first night.
"The Marquis, furious, declared that
his wife should not appear. In despair
Ferry then promised that Signor Ma
sini should be substituted for Nicolini,
but on the evening of the representation
the latter stepped forth.
"After such occurrences no descrip
tion of the scenes enacted in the De
Caux household is needed to explain
how the inevitable rupture between
husband and wife came about."
Patti had held a brilliant social po
sition until this time, but she was
obliged to endure much obloquy after
her defection with the tenor. When
she appeared upon the stage women of
high social position either left their
boxes or drew the curtains.
Early in the seventies the Marquis
began divorce proceedings, which were
not concluded until late in 1884. Judg
ment was rendered in favor of the Mar
quis, "inasmuch as the scandal which
caused the separation between husband
and wife was still maintained."
In August, 1886, the offending couple
were married, and the devotion of the
pair is unparalleled in the annals of
stage romances. Never were they sep
arated, and Patti Insisted always upon
having Nicolini in the same company
with herself.
In his tenderness and care for her
Nicolini was untiring, ever watching
over and protecting her from every
thing that could bring injury to her or
to her voice.
During one of their visits to this city
the chronicler happened to ride in the
elevator of the hotel in which they were
stopping at the same time that they
were ascending. La diva's throat was
closely muffled In some soft silken
fabric. An acquaintance in the ele
vator addressed a remark to her, and
in an Instant Nicolini stepped forward,
placed a gentle finger upon Patti's lips
and remarked that madame never
spoke on the days when she was to
sing.
To the day of Nicolini's death, which
occurred little more than a year ago,
there was, apparently, never a cloud
to mar the halycon bliss of their union.
And now for the third time Mme.
Patti is going to take a chance in the
lottery of matrimony. The little game
seems to have a wonderful fascination
1 or* ye merry stage folk.
One blank â one prize â has been the
result of Patti's matrimonial ventures
so far.
Her chances seem about even.
There is certainly no reason why she
should not take such a step.
She is charming enough and young
enough at heart to make most men
happy.
And, in the meantime, all London
talks.

All dim before.
And straight there rose around
A new strange world, all wonderful ,
With words to hear and things to do
The old world had not known.
A hand was laid on mine, *,ââ,Â«, !
And sudden glow shot through my frame.
All cold before.
And with the touch awoke
That which had slept and now rushed forth
With radiant hopes and daring dreams
The old days could not hold.
Dear lips were pressed to mine.
And sudden flame burned in my soui.
All calm before.
And from that flame there sprung ,
A new strange self whose pulses throbbed I
With secrets vague, mysterious.

SIMPLICITY OF GREAT MEN.
The simplicity and ignorance of great
men form the subject of an entertain
ing article by Mr. Michael MacDonagh (
in the current number of the Cornhill
Magazine. There are, he says, many
amusing examples of the infantile
ignorance of judges, such as the late
Lord Coleridge's "Who Is Connie Gil
christ?" Sir Henry Hawkins' "What is
hay?" and Earl Halsbury's "Who was
Plgott?" In a libel action by a lady
journalist against Mr. Gilbert a few
years ago Sir E. Clarke read from a
book of the plaintiffs a description of
Chopin's "umber-shaded hair." Lord
Russell of Killowen's face assumed a
look of blank astonishment. "What
shade?" said he. "Umber-shaded," re
plied Sir Edward. "Yes, but what
shade is that?" pressed the Chief Jus
tice. The British jury could stand it
no longer. "Brown, my Lord â brown,"
they all cried with one voice and the
case proceeded.
Mr. Justice Ball, an Irish Judge, was
noted for his amusing manifestations
of ignorance, but whether they were
real or pretended has never been clear
ly established.^ He tried a case in which
a man was indicted for robbery at the
house of a poor widow. The first wit
ness was the young daughter of the
widow, who identified the prisoner as
the man who entered the house and
smashed her mother's chest. "Do you
say that the prisoner at the bar broke
your mother's chest?" said the Judge,
in astonishment. "He did, my Lord."
answered the girl, "he Jumped on it till
he smashed it entirely." The Judge
turned to the crown counsel and said,
"How is this? Why is the prisoner not
indicted for murder? If he smashed
this poor woman's chest. in the way the
witness has described, he must surely
have killed her." "But, my Lord,"
said the counsel, "it was a wooden
chest!" :': ;-.V
Some men were indicted at the Cork
Assizes for riot and assault before the
same Judge. The prisoners had beaten
two laborers who were drawing turf
from a bog belonging to an obnoxious
landlord. One of the witnesses said in
the course of his evidence, "As we
came near to the bog we saw the
prisoners fencing along the road "
"Eh! what do you say the prisoners
were doing?" asked Mr. Judge Ball
"Fencing, my Lord." "With what?"
"Spades and shovels," my Lord." The
Judge, looking amazed, said .to the
crown counsel, "Can this be true? Am
I to understand that peasants in this
part of the country fence along the
roads, using spades and shovels for
foils?" "I can explain it, my Lord,"
said the counsel. "The prisoners were
making a ditch, which we call a fence
in this part of the country."

Special to The Sunday Call.
NEW YORK. Nov. 25.â 1t sounds
like what the boys call a "chest
nut" to say that it will be a win
ter of furs, but such is truly
the case. Furs belong to cold
weather Just as they belong to
animals that live in the Arctic zone. But
this winter more than any winter
for years past furs will be worn by every
woman who can afford them.
This last clause is well added, for with
their very great popularity the price of
furs have gone up; for instance, take
Fueh a simple thing as a muff and boa.
Last winter you could get a very good set
for $15â ten for the muff and five for the
boaâ the fur being a nondescript of dark
shades. The cheap chinchilla could also
be obtained for that price.
This year you need $50 for a muff and
boa; that is If you are going to suit your
â  n the selection.
The furs are absolutely bewitching; no
- word will express their loveliness.
They arP also, as the marriage notes say
of the gifts, "numerous and costly," and
Itively irresistible.
In one of the shop windows of New
York the other day I found a silver fox
muff and boa, which, i.i spite of tho hand
t .me price which the editor of this news
paper pays me for writing this fashion
letter. I was unable to buy, although I
would gladly have worked all winter for
ftâ had there been nothing else to buy.
The- boa consisted of a great, round
foil of fur, which might have been, to
ft brilliant fancy, the body of a blue fox
stretched out, delighted at the prospect
of .encircling some fair neck. The head
< f tho fox formed one end of the boa, the
tail completed the other. The latter was
and silvery, with the blue of the
fur; it was so deep that you could bury
your face in It, yet so soft that it could
be. drawn through your hands. It was
Just a nice length, long enough to reach
when fastened just to the waist, with the
tail falling over the muff.
And the muff, what a pretty thing
it was! a great round mass, fully an arm
ful of blue fur with a blue fox's head at
the front and a great sweeping tall at
one . side. L'nrier the fox's head there
was a pocket Into which a small handker
chief could be thrust and a dime for car
fare. The lining of the muff was a love
ly scarlet, and when I carry that muff.
If the time ever comes, I shall wear with
It a coat lined with pcarlet.
I saw another handsome cape, and as
my fancy is fickle I may really choose it
instead of the other. It was made of er
mine, with the longest "eyes" upon it that
you ever saw. Around the edge of the
ermine cape were, thrc-e ruffles of silk
over silk, one falling over the other, and
each one edged with black stitching.
The muff was simply immense; nothing
elce would describe ft, and I hope the girl
who carries it will not lift it to her face,
for It will cover it.
Such lovely hats are to be worn this
winter. They are tin-tilted either far
i ' <r the face or far back: you can wear
i your hat just as you please, provided you
f lo not wear it in conventional style â
square over the pyi B.
The newest hats have still the pudding
laX tops made of spotted velvet, bro
caded silk, cloth, beads and gold and sil
ver. The latter can be taken almost lit
erally, for there were actually exhibited
in one of the shop windows of New York

guinea hen's breast Is highly desired; so
also is the breast of the Australian bird
which is now gayly singing in this coun

priced, andâ told as a secretâ so is that
of the duck also. These thick, soft breasts
are finished with plumes which are very

The very newest capes have fur com

For example, there was exhibited in a
very elegant shop window in New, York
a few days ago a sealskin cape which
consisted of bands of sealskin with puffs
of purple satin set in between, as a satin
puff and a band of sealskin, then a puff
and another band of sealskin until the
cape reached to the hips. It was a nov

in fashion?"

no hope of a resurrection.
Hate are not quite bizarre, although
they are nearly so; they are becoming,
and that isaves them from being gro
tesque. Yet It is hard to describe them.
One of the most beautiful hats seen at
the convention of women's clubs in New
York, where hats were very handsome,
was the tiniest' green velvet toque worn
very far back on the head. At one side
were eight or ten feathery plumes, which
waved very gracefully over the back of
the head.
Mrs. William Tod Heluth, the president,
wore a toque so small that it could not be
seen from the audience except for Its wav
ing plumage.
Mrs. Theodore Sutro, the woman lawyer,
musical composer, society woman and
wife of a millionaire, wore a picture hat
well on one side caught with a beautiful
breast. The whole was of velvet except the
breast, which might have been that of a
bird of paradise. Several of the women
wore whole birds, head, feet, tail feathers
and all upon one side of the hat. Incident
ally there was a velvet crown and the piece
of a brim tipped over the ear. These odd
little hats are soft and becoming and you
cannot wonder that they remain popular.
In the midst sat the Audubon sisters,
grave and sedate in velvet hatsâfoather
less.
â¢ Winter, coats are still hesitating between
the tightntting and the loose. The close
fitting are very close indeed, suggesting
the tailor-made. The loose ones are very
loose and some of them have the Watteau
plait, which falls . from the back of the
neck. The plait In this case is lined with

Kid yokes are the "very-, latest things for

HELEN WARD.
Theater
Fashions.
THE absorbing question: What
shall we hear at the theaters?
has been answered. Grand opera
Is an assured fact. The more ab
sorbing question, What shall we
wear? naturally arises. For 'tis
sale! that If the theater-going women
were given their choice of two imperative
afflictionsâ of becoming either deaf or
blind during the opera seasonâ they would
promptly give their preference to deaf
ness.
The origin of dress Is usually wrongly
assigned to the ingenuity of the first
woman. Not at all. She may have pro
pounded the first essentials of clothes, but
it was an astute man who hit upon the
evolution of dresp.
He was trying to baffle the curiosity of
his wife, which he found Inconvenient,
after the manner of man sometimes.
"If I could only head her off on some
other idea! Happy thought. I'll try to
put together a new fabric for a dress." So
he expounded the pros and cons, the whys
and wherefores, the raison d'etre of dress,
till the feminine attention was thoroughly
aroused.
The instinct once implanted soon became
second nature in her sex. The modern
man finds little difficulty in his way when
he wishes his wife's mind to turn to the
subject of clothes.
Some beautiful gowns and opera cloaks
are ready to shed their wrappings and de
light the eyes of the public as soon as the
proper time arrives. Unless all signs and
auguries go for naught we are to have
a very dressy season at the theaters. The
heraldings of La Mode are even more
comforting than the advance notices of
the press agents. Buds, belles and mat
rons have all signified their willingness
to don purple ana fine linen for the thea
ters.
The matinee girl who Is absolutely good
form will still wear a simple but elegant
tailor-made gown. An elaborate robe at
an afternoon performance is in poor taste.
There is always a large sprinkling of
gowns of this sort, but the wearers never
belong to the sacred inner circle. I
counted over a dozen society girls last
Saturday afternoon. They one and all
wore tailor gowns.
For the evening there are gowns and
wraps gorgeous enough to please the most
fastidious. For the opera season there
are some semi-decollete gowns that will
delight the eyes of the beholders. The very
low-necked gowns have never found fa
vor with San Francisco theater-goeri.
A beautiful gown which will be worn for
a theater party In the near futuro Is made
in a semi-decollete design with a dog-col
lar of pearls. The bodice Is made with a
lace yoke terminating In long narrow
points of lacÂ©, the points upturned, and
caught under the pearl collar. The effect
of the flesh tints showln* between the
strips of lace Is wonderfully attractive.
The gown Is m turquolie blue taffrtn,
showing to advantage the blonde beauty
of the wearer. '
The theater Jackets are newer and bid
fair to be equally as popular as the opera
capes. The only objection to them is that
they are more likely to crush the bodico
underneath. They are all made in Louis
XVI style, finished in tabÃ around the
lower edge of the jacket. In fact, every
thing must be tailed, whether it be coat,
mantle or skirt.
A striking little theater jacket in this
Louis XVI mode has been brought over
from Paris by one of our beautiful society
women. It is made of yellow and white
brocade. A wired lace collar flares up at
the back of the neck and terminates in
front in two long points. The Bmall sleeves
reach only to the elbow, where they are
finished with upturned lace cuffs. A frill
of lace fails from under the tabs that are
cut around the lower edge of the jacket.
Two wide revers fold back from the front
and each ends at the waist line.
The style of wearing odd waists and
skirts has been revived and pleads Its own
cause, not only from a point of usefulnebS,
but because some beautiful combinations
are really possible. A creamy tan skirt,
with a bodice In rose has Just left the
modiste's hands and is really a thing of
beauty. The combination of color used
this season is far more harmonious than
heretofore. Glaring effects are no longer

fitting the hips without a wrinkle. From
below the knee it widens out into volumin
ous clinging folds. This necessitates a
great deal of attention to one's steps when
walking. If not properly handled the be
holder is very likely to think that infirm
old age has suddenly descended on the
victim to Fashion.
Since theater no longer consists of two
solid hours of millinery, large picture
hats are seldom worn, for they are too
cumbersome to hold. They are only seen
at the matinee in the boxes, where they
can enjoy the proud distinction of adorn
ing the 'wearer's head throughout the
play.
Picture toques are affected by girls who
have not quite attained the age of opera
bonnets. The hair is arranged In some
pretty, fluffy manner that will look well
with the toque removed.
AT-HOME
DRESSES
FOR at-home dancing parties young
ladies are expected to be suitably
gowned, which means in thin gowns
of organdy, net, chiffon, etc., over silk
linings, or light silk gowns with belts
and sash ends of velvet edged with tiny
frills -of black or white mousseline. Silk
at 75 cents a yard Is pretty and would be
economical as It would answer another
â eason for a lining.
Fetching Suit for Winter Wear.
White, pink, turquoise, light yellow and
lavender are the favorite evening colors
in the order named. White forms a con
venient dress, as different accessories
may be used with it and the skirt worn
with odd waists. If merely a looker-on
a light dress or waist, made high in the
neck and long sleeved, in silk or
chiffon, or a light weight veiling
trimmed with three gored ruffles to the
knees, each edged with velvet ribbon;
blouse waist finished with two ruffles
around the low neck and a removable
yoke of white lace over pink, of pink
tucked taffeta, with collar, belt and sash
ends of the silk, would be appropriate.
Another suitable toilet is a black silk or
nice white wool Â»klrt. with a full gath
ered waist of light-colored chiffon having
collar and sash of silk or velvet. One
more advanced in years might wear a
light waist and black silk skirt, or an en
tire black silk costume with lace yoke or
vest.
A black silk is again the most useful
dress for one's wardrobe, and in contem
plating a city visit, with any of its at
tendant gayetles, such a gown becomes
an absolute necessity. If bent upon a
quiet visit without any society one may
dress more plainly, but in all cases the
social position of the friends who are en
tertaining us must be considered.

The novelist can give the preacher some
good points, and especially in the matter
of the sermon plan. After Zola had col
lected some 1700 pages of notes and ar
ranged them in order he writes about
"Lourdes": "My book is finished; ; I
have only to write It." George Eliot
would make several draughts of her plot
before she wrote a line. Of Mrs. Henry
Wood her biographer says: "The great
amount of thought and deliberation be
stowed upon her books was always at the
commencement. She would first compose
her plot â a matter of extreme care and
deliberation, where nothing was passed
over or hurried. This would take her
about three weeks of very close applica
tion, and until the whole was accom
plished not one line was written." As a
rule the more time a preacher spends
over the plans of hie sermon the less time
will he need to spend on Its composition.

If we would keep the colors of the lilies
and the rose in our cheeks we must labor
unceasingly. "We must see to it that the
diet is what it should be; that our bodies
are kept clean; that the creams and lo
tions that we put upon our faces are of
the purest; that our sleeping rooms are
well ventilated; that we take sufficient
exercise to keep the blood from getting
sluggish; and last, but not least, that
the water with which we wash our faces
is as soft as it is possible to get it. There
is no sort of doubt but that the water
wi.ich comes to us through the hydrants
and faucets of a city residence is respon

The secret of a beautiful complexion is
said by those who ought to know to lie
in the exclusive use of rain water for
washing purposes.
Ninon de l'Enclos never used anything
upon her face but rain water, and she .

she was still capable of inspiring the ten

Of Diane de Poitiers and Madame Re

the next best thing Is distilled water.
This is said to be the very best whltener

cost of a few dollars, but if one does not

latterly refuse to allow your face to
have evon a bowing acquaintance with
hard water. The lime which it contains
will crack the epidermis, roughen, redden
and chap it out of all semblance of
bonuty.
The face must be thoroughly scrubbed
once in the twenty-four hours lest the
pores become clogged with the Brooke ar.d
dust of the atmosphere. Bedtime Is the
best time for this scrubbing and a little
castile soap and ft camel's hair face
brush will assist the cleansing operation.
Then, to keep the skin soft and yielding,
free from harshness and on unpleasant
terms with wrinkles, a little pure cold
cream should i,e used.
In the morning it will not be necessary
to again wash the face unless the skin
has not absorbed all the oils of the cream.
In that case merely wipe away with a
cloth just slightly moistened. If the face
needs washing at other times I would sug
gest that this toilet milk be used:

Answers to Correspor)dents.
X B. R.â You, too, I feel certain will
forgive me for not having replied to your
letter by mall. The alum wash Is to be
used only In case of ftabbiness of the
skin, and should be used after massage
with a good cold cream or skin food. A
piece the size of a bean In a pint of water
is plenty. It is not necessary to bind It on
over nightâ just dip a piece of absorbent
cotton or a small sponge In the water and
dabble It on the chin.
AUGUSTAâ The condition of your skin
is no doubt caused by an impure condi
tion of the blood. Try and remedy this
by plenty of outdoor exercise, and by eat
ing good, nourishing food. Avoid all rich
and indigestible foods, such as gravies,
fried foods, pastries, sweets, pickles and
all highly spiced dishes. Eat vegetables
and lots of fruit. Sleep in a well ventilat
ed room; take a daily tepid sponge bath
and a hot bath twice a week, scrubbing
the entire body briskly with a flesh brush
and a good soap. Then suppose you first
drive away the pimples by sponging the
blemishes with diluted llsterlne. When
they disappear, go for the blackheads
each night with a camelshriir face scrub
bing brush, tepid water and castile soap.
After thoroughly rinsing and drying the
face, rub Into the skin cold cream made
after the following formula: Spermaceti,
one ounce; white wax, one ounce; oil of
sweet almonds, five ounces; rosewater,
one and three-fourths ounces, and twenty
grains of borax. Melt the first three in
gredients In a porcelain kettle over a slow
tire, and be sure not to let the mixture
boil. Remove from tho heat and add the
rosewater In which the borax has been
dissolved. Fluff up witk an egg-beater.
E. B. â Take equal parts of red vaseline
and cocoanut oil and mix by melting in
a porcelain kettle. This will do nicely to
make the eyebrows grow, but it is rather
B risky business to put anything on the
lashes, as the simplest oil will irritate the.
eyes. To make the neck plump massage
every night for ten or fifteen minutes with
equal parts of cocoa butter, laimline and
cocoanut oil melted together. The breath
ing exercise given in beauty talk of Sun
day before last will help wonderfully.
BEATRICE B.â l am afraid nothing but
time will restore the color to your faded
locks. For the dry and brittle condition
I would advise massaging the scalp with
a little pure olive oil which has been
heated. The next simplest tonic is sage
tea. Take a small handful of the com
mon dried sage, which can be bought at
any drugstore, and place It in a porcelain
kettle. Add nearly a quart of water and
let simmer until it has boiled down to
about a pint. Strain and add one table
spoonful of alcohol. This will darken the
hair slightly and may be just what you
r.f-ed. Cutting the ends of the hair is
excellent and is surely not the cause of its
becoming coarse and dry.
MRS. W.â I can tell you of nothing bet
ter in the way of a skin food than the one
you are using. Perhaps you have not
used it long enough to see Its good effects,
for it may be that your skin does not re
spond readily to treatment. I am so
pleased that the exercises which I recom
mended for reducing the large abdomen
have been of so much benefit to you. I
consider the rubber toilet brushes too
harsh and severe. The camel's hair
brushes are better, but unless there are
blackheads or clogged pores the crash
wash cloth will do just as well.
ETHEL B.â You can get a piece of fine
ly cut pumice stone, and by rubbing it
daily over the superfluous hairs can keep
the skin free from the blemishes. This
will not destroy them for good, and al
ways, but by constant use will keep the
skin clear of them. Peroxide of hydrogen
âthe liquid used for bleaching the hair
can be applied with perfect safety. It
will bleach the hairs to a lighter shade,
so that they will be less noticeable. Soap
if It is pure should not encourage the
growth of hair on the face, but it is very
difficult to tell about these things. Where
the tendency toward a superfluous growth
is excessive, almost everything will seem
to stimulate it, even friction. A pure and
perfectly harmless powder can be made
after the following formula: One ounce
Lubin's rice powder; one ounce best, pur
est oxide of zinc; one-half ounce carbo
nate of magnesia, finely powdered; twen
ty grains boracic acid: ten drops attar of
roses. When purchasing your Ingredients
ask your druggist to powder each separ
ately in a mortar. First put your rice
powder through a fine sieve and then
through bolting cloth. Do the same thing
with the oxide of zinc, the magnesia and
the boracic acid before adding them to
the rice powder. When all are combined

Here is an excellent tonic for falling

fancy a quart would be about right. There
are two or three of your questions yet

KITTIE M.â l really do not know what
to suggest in connection with the co,d
cream. I have never known It to act in
the way you describe, and could not very
well tell what is wrong with it without
seeing it. Possibly your skin needs nour
ishment and the orange flower skin food
would be better for it. I'm 80 sorry you
have had such a time.
MRS. W.â l wouldn't use precipitated
chalk on the skin if I were you. Not that
it is particularly injurious to the skin
but it is very apt to roughen it. The cold
cream that you mention I have never
heard of before, so do not know If it is
pure or not, and I do not advise any one
to put any preparation upon the face tne
ingredients of which they do not know.
TOPSYâ I cannot tell you just how
much of the orange flower skin food it
will take to bring about the result >ou
desire. If the face is very much emaci
ated it will take longer to fill out the hol
lows, of course, and, too. some skins
respond more quickly to treatment tnan
others. The development when once ac-'
quired will remain without further mas
sage, unless one loses one's health and
: strength. Just rub the cream lightly over '
the nose without rubbing it in. The deep
lines that you speak of on either side the
mouth will sometimes resist all efforts to
get rid of them. The only thing that will
nave any effect upon them is systematic
massage with the skin food, rubbing al-.
ways across the lines and away from the
. mouth, upward. Massage must always
be gentle, taking care not to stretch the
skin. I cannot suggest anything for the
daughter's fingers except to put some
thing bitter on them to keep her from
putting them in her mouth. It is merely
a habit and , one that should be easily
broken. " ' .

HAROLD FREDERIC`S PLAN OF WORK
As a Novelist
THE late HaroTfl Frederic, -wliose
recent death has been already
duly reported in this as in. most
other newspapers, was a man ->t
pronounced peculiarities of manner
and character: but he had the power
of inspiring some extraordinarily close
attachment?. When Stephen Crane
made his first visit to London, a year
or two ago, a great friendship sprang
up. almost in a night, between him and
Frederic; and thenceforward one was
never-failing in uttering the praises of
the other. Their ardor in mutual ad
miration was at times a little amusing;
end it might at times even have proved
offensive but for the unquestionable
sincerity of it.
The eminent quality In Frederic's
composition seems to have been his in
domitableness; he was a man who
never gave up; and' the good rank he
attained as a journalist, and later as a
novelist, he attained largely by force of
â¢will. This is shown in the way in
which he wrote his first novelâ that is,
the first undertaken, but, as it after
wards proved, not the first finished. He
told the story of this enterprise once
to his friend, R. H. Sherard, and it has,
I believe, never been published â cer
tainly not in this country. "All the
time that I was editing this paper,"
said he, the paper referred to being the
Albany Journal, "I was wanting to
write my novel, 'In the Valley,' my his
torical novel, my Lorna Doone, than
which I shall probably never write any
thing better. I started on it four or
five, times whilst in Albany, but al
ways tore up all that I had written be
cause 1 was not satisfied with it. I
once wrote as much as twenty thou
sand words, and altogether I must have
written fully fifty thousand words of
this novel, all of which went into the
fire."
Here the work stopped until after
Frederic went to London, to represent
the New yorkv ork Times. "There, after
some time," said he, "I began once
more upon 'In the Valley, 1 ' and during
I>-M wrote about seventeen thousand
words, which I also threw awaj. I
then realized that I did not know how
to make a book, hew to cover a can
vas. I had notions about how certain
parts of the canvas had to be covered,
but did not know how to complete the
work as a whole. So, as an experi
ment, a literary preliminary canter, I
wrote "Seth's Brother's Wife.' I wrote
it off-hand and purely as an experi
ment, to see what it was like to write
a bonk. When it was written I sent it
to Scribner's. . ever believing that
they would accept it. To my enormous
surprise they wrote to tell me that
they were starting- a new magazine and
that they would like to use my story
as the first serial in that magazine. It
was thus that # Seth's Brother's Wife'
appeared in Scribner's Magazine, where
it made its point. Encouraged by this
success I felt at liberty to set about
my 'In the Valley,' the thing nearest to
my heart, and in eight months, in the
year ISS7, I wrote that book. It was
written as I say in eight months, but
it represented eleven years of work and
preparation."
As a novelist Frederic regarded him
self as the direct son of the famous
French collaborators, Erckmann and
Chatrian. "I hold myself, more indebt
ed to these two men than to all other
writers in any language, all put togeth
er," was his positive way of putting it.
Except "The Damnation of Theron
Ware," none of his novels can be said
to have had great success.' They have
all' had high commendation; but, for
the most part, moderate sales. He had
finished a new novel only a month or
two before he died, which will be pub
lished serially in this country by the
Saturday Evening Post of Philadel
phia. I have had the privilege of read
ing it in manuscript and I can say that
for immediate and sustained interest
it is. the equal of anything he ever
wrote. It is the story of an immense
speculator, who, after many disap
pointments, makes a mammoth fortune
at a single stroke, and then, having no
further need of money, tries to adopt
t-he life of a gentleman of leisure. The
discord between such a life and his ac

into the mysteries of the order. This cir

sketches of tenement house life in Isew
York City. This story will prove more in
teresting to New Yorkers than to other
readers, but it is well worth a perusal on
the part of anybody who has any interest
in the lives of the lowly. Its significance
lies in the fact that Mulberry street has
been for many years the site of the Met

here told being drawn from the daily

then, while picturing the play and strug

1430.GILLETTE'S CLEVER WORK
In "Secret Service."
JOKES come true sometimes. One I
day shortly after the Columbia'
Theater management had secured
control of the Baldwin and Califor
nia Melville Marx said. "Now
we've pot theaters to burn." In a few
yreeka the Columbia was richly dam
aged by flre and water; in a few weeks
more the California was singed and al
most the scene of a frightful panic;
and now the Baldwin is burnt to the
last entrail. Three fires in a year for!
one management in one town is a seri
ous haxd-luck Btory. To be burned by i
the clitics is bad enough, but the real
â¢thing is awful. It is discouraging.
"While/ The Fire Department poets of,
the p'rVss are applauding the burning
of the Baldwin as a vital protection of j
inflajiimable humanity, Messrs. Gottlob
and Marx are wondering when their
turn will be over. They are frankly
tired of fires and think that they have
suffered more than their share for the
good and excitement of the town.
And William Cillette, what must he
think? "Secret Service" goes all over
the English 'speaking world and is re
ceived with noble acclaim, only to come
to San Francisco and be ignominiously
â  1 out. There have been shows at
the BaMiwn that -would have justified
any fire, but "Secret Service" is not one
if them. It is a wonderful play, the
best 'ever written in this country, and
it Is played by a remarkably poised act
or and a strong, -well-ordered company.
â¢n may not have approved of the
the Baldwin that would have justified
3,) r from God-like in its social policy,
but surely heaven could have had no
vengeance to wreak on "Secret Serv
ice," as modest a masterpiece as ever
â¢was played. Mr. Gillette has reason to
he disappointed in Western hospitality,
and Mr. GottJob and Mr. Marx are just
ly weary of the persistent warmth of
their fate. But none of these gentle
men Is spending his hours in idle moan
ing. Ever since the morning of the
Baldwin tire the California has been
the Bcene of lightning preparation. Mr.
Gillette, of course, wired to New York
immediately for duplicate scenery and
mes, but against their late coming
the local scene maker and costumer
were put to rush work. By all
I'resent tokens "Secret Service" will be
as good as ever when it is presented j
I alifornia to-morrow' night, j
.iy. it. is not a play whose sue- \

more due to scenery than it
â  is due to an actress who has made an
nit of crying. It succeeds because Its
excitement is human, mental. It Is
quite different from Mr. Belasco's wob
bling "Heart of Maryland." In that
difference is the principal reason why
it is a great play. The comic relief
which, though clever on Its own lin*?,
..volitional and inclined now and
then: to interrupt the suspense and the j
on, is perhaps the only vulnerable!
}>uri of rhe work. Certainly the rest is
rly.ytewed by any standard that 1
may be set for a play of adventure and j
And if Mr. Gillette has used j
>n of the old mode of melo- j
drama and in spite of the handicap
i In writing a masterpiece, so
ihe more honor to his crafts
hip. We used to look to Augustu
as for the great American pla>
but of late he seems to have staggerec
!;â¢ the roadside. He has spoiled th
memory of "In Mizzoura" by reckless!
v ,rking over the gem situations of tha
jlay into several later ones. He ha^.
} "t-boiled and not even been popula
at it. Gillette is an artist who, as yet,
has never gone back. "Too Muc
Johnson" is the cleverest of the Ameri
canized farces and "Secret Service"
the finest of the American plays â i
and these are his latest works. We
used to look to Thomas to be the
ancestor of the native drama, but
Gillette is the man now. It is to be
looped that his next play will be an
original one and not, as per rumor, an
adaptation. No onÂ». in this country is
to be mentioned with him as an adapt
or,: but, even so, his art is too precious
to be used up in polishing off another
man's invention. If it is, as with Syd
r.cy Grundy in England, a question of
money, some philanthropic patriot
ought to buy up William Gillette and
nave him for the glory of his country.
The old days of patrons were not such
bad days after all. Many a man of to
day TVould be fattening posterity with
rpieces if he worked for one mas
ter instead of a million. Another thing

The fire means one less of the cheap
theaters, as the regular Baldwin at
tractions will play at the Columbia and
those intended for the Columbia at the
California. It is vaguely rumored that
Richard Mansfield may open the new
year at the Columbia with "Cyrano de
Bergerac." In the meantime we are
having- plenty of cheap "Cyrano," but
very little sensation about it. The Hen
derson production offers no cue for a
serious consideration of the play, and
the critics have about used up their
jokes on the subject. Undisoouraged,
the Tivoli has worked away on its pro
duction, which will be divulged to-mor
row night with Edwin Stevens as the
Cyrano Savlnien Hercule de Bergeriic
and Elvia Crox as the Roxane. Mr.
Stevens and Miss Crox and Stage Man

the performance. If there is any bur
lesque it will not be of the conscious

I "Two years ago I arrived in Vienna
a few hours before my concert and
wafi very much astonished to find at
the Hotel Bristol hundreds of letters
not only from musicians and the press
but from wealthy people, asking for
tickets for my concert. The key to
that riddle was quickly found out. A
rather eccsntrie Countess (one of the
greatest professional beauties) had
bought the whole house, and when I
: appeared on the stage I found her sit
ting alone in a big arm-chair in the
I immense hall. Never mind, I playedâ
perhaps better that evening than a few
days later, when I had to repeat the
programme before a crowded audi-

THE OUJER~WOFLD.
Hillary Bell has this to say In the New
York press, apropos of a cheap Cyrano
production: "Why 'Cyrano de Bergerac,'
whose chief charm Is Its simplicity of ro
mance, should be considered a fitting at-
traction in the Bowery, whose tastes are
feverish and unhealthy, is a managerial
mystery beyond telling. Rostand's drama
was nevc-r Intended for and never can be
properly applied to the entertainment of
an audience which is not susceptible to
the noetry of life; and' the story must be
treated with care by the actors and
thoughtful consideration by the specta
tors in order to arrive at success.
The contention of this journal, put forth
when the play was first produced, was,
and still is. that "Cyrano," like Audrey,
is not made for every market. In the
Uo'.vcrj it is treated with derision, and
Augustin Daly's production raised such a
Btona In the newspapers that .hat rr>n
ager will hardly venture the Rostand play
during his coming season at the home the
ater. As in his dramatic history the long
nosed man lias an effective way of re
venging himself upon those who take llb
crtlfs with him. There was no particular
harm in Mr. Daly's treatment of the
French work, for that same system has
enabled us to continue in enjoyment r >t
the English comedies. But, apparently
Cyrann casts some occult and malign in
fluence over tamperers with his dignity,
and the fortune which has attended him in

Paris and London with Coquelin follows
Mansfield in New York, but is opposed to
other actors who have not observed simi
lar respect for his speech or personality
On his return home Mr. Daly will revive
Shakespeare instead of Rostand, and give
us the big-nosed man of Venice instead of
the bis-nosed man of Paris. There is no
sign of longevity in the Bowery produc
tion, and probably the enterprising Mr.
Brady may hesitate before sending out his
projected companies. From the furor
aroused by its production in England and
France, it was believed that "Cyrano
possessed the cosmopolitan qualities of
Trilby," but the play had no sooner been
done in rhe best possible style at the Gar
den than it became apparent that Rostand
was caviare to the general. "Cyrano de
Hergerac" belongs to Richard Mansfield in
this country as much as if he held the
rights to it. and though he cannot protect
the play in law. it is self-defensive be
cause unintelligible to other audiences
than those that form his following."
The following estimate of Henry Arthur
Jones and his comedy. "The Liars,"
which John Drew is playing in New York,
is written by the critic of the Commer
cial Advertiser:
That "The Liars" will run successfully
for some time there is little doubt. The
causes are visible to the naked eye and
they will not make a pessimist of any one
who was not one before.
Henry Arthur Jones is unsympa
thetic people call a Philistine. As Vol
taire might have said, a Philistine is one
of the most useful animals in this best
of all possible worlds. He often has a
good heart, tears moisten his eyes at the
sight of virtue, and he works with regu
larity, reacting exactly at the pull of
given strings. On these strings Mr.
Henry Arthur Jones keeps his hands, not
because he is a cynic, and knows that in
such manner shall he achieve success,
but because he is that kind of a useful
animal himself.
He never gets over the heads of any of
us. Certain statements have been proved
humorous by the experience of centuries.
From those' Mr. Jones selects his jokes.
Certain situations succeed upon the stage
every year of the century. Those Mr.
Jones knows and handles with faithful
precision. Other men among the contem
poraries of this gifted author pack one
meaning inside another, so that there is
the obvious surface for some of us and
the inner Intricacies or delicacies for oth
ers. Anybody may laugh at Gilbert, Pi
nero or Shaw, and yet see but a little of
what is there. One who sees anything in
Mr. Jones sees all there is. He writes for
good, honest, commonplace men and
women, and he never fools them to the
top of their bent. In his hands they are
safe as an infant in the care of a fond
parent. As Meredith and Hardy are elus
ive and unfair to the portly merchant,
yet often dramatic and of general appeal,
so are Gilbert and Barrie, but even as
Hall Came gives to the multitude una
dulterated intellectual food which they
like and fatten upon, so Jones, somewhat
higher in the same class, perennially pro
duces the supply which is in most de
mand. , ,__;
As the serious parts of Mr. Jones bring
this pleasant trait more to the front, there
is room for thanks that "The Liars" 1?
comedy. Pedestrian as his humor is, it is
Aght compared to his solemnity. Last
night when Sir Christopher Deering and
Edward Falkner, charming gentleman
and knightly hero respectively, had quar
reled and were about to part, each turns 1
at the appointed time, just before one j
has reached the rear door:
"Kit!" cries one.
"Ned!" the other cries.
That is Jones when he is touching.
When he is humorous he be.cngs to a
mixed speeches. His "Liars " is a kind of
mongrel, half-artificial and half-natural,
not sparkling enough to be a polished
artifice or intelligent enough for a com
edy of nature. Fundamentally, Henry
Arthur Jones Is not altogether easy to
hoist into the hierarchy of the great.
The pupils in a certain New Hampshire
village school are taught a cheerful com
bination of music, morals and mathe
matics. They sing the following verses
to the tune of "Yankee Doodle":
"The surest way on earth to make
A jrreat and glorious nation.
Is for each boy and girl to get
A thorough education.
Five times five are twenty-five.
Five times six are thirty.
Five times seven are thirty-five,
And five times_eight are "forty."

! as an actor in "The Christian" and pre
â¢ sented so striking an appearance in the
rote, Mr. Haworth had a doubly difficult
task before him in assuming the place
of his able and popular prejSeoessor.
Nevertheless, he mad'- a succesa of the
undertaking, and in the same scenes in
which Mr. Morgan made his strongest
points he won emphatic approval and re
callsâand not through a mere reproduc- .
tion of Mr. Morgan's mariner or methods
but by a forceful and manly performance
after his own conception of the part. He
was not so fine looking a Storm as was
Mr. Morgan, but he acted the role with
intelligent discretion, admirable voice and
gesture, and at times invested the char
actor with a new pathos that was most
effective.
TVe are making an uncommon fuss over
Edmond Rostand at present. What is
there in "Cyrano de Bergerac" that will
compare in theatric art. to say nothing
of diction, with "The Merchant of Ven
ice?" Shakespeare found a long-nosed
man in Italy, Rostand one in France.
That is all the similitude. Otherwise
Hyperion to a Satyr. A year from now
"Cyrano" will b" forgotten in the limba
that holds "Trilby." "Pinafore" and
"Charley's Aunt." Shylock will still have
his pound of flesh centuries after all
modern authors are gone into dust. So
writes Hillary Bell.
The New York Evening Sun thus re
sponds to "A Constant Reader": No.
There is no truth in the rumor that Mr.
Daly intends to rename the Shakespear
ian play which he will produce at hÂ»s
theater on Saturday. "The Girl From
Venice." Such a rumor could only have
been started by some one with a preju.
dice against Mr. Dalyâ possibly M. Ros
tand. If any change in the title of "The

Stage versions of "Pickwick"â there

been very successful in America. A
dramatization of "Pickwick" is to be one

Sarah Bernhardt has Just celebrated
very Quietlyâ her fifty-fourth birthday. ;
Went Out Between /\cts Herself,
It did not take place in the city of:
Washington, because no man in Wash
ington leaves a lady alone while he goes
out between the acts at a theater â un
less it be his wife, and, of course, that
doesn't count. . '.
But it did occur, and the site of Its
occurrence is not west of the Alleghaâ
nies, where, according to some Eastern .
thinkers, all the peculiar occurrences ...
occur.
The man In the case was perhaps SO,
the girl 22, and the theater was one in
which the melodrama has its home.
The girl was pretty and there was that
kind of a jaw hedging the lower part
of her rosy cheeks that ought to have
been a hint to the young man. The
young man was a very fair sample of
the average chap who makes $1200 to
$1500 a year.
Between them and the aisle sat a big
man of 50 with his wife and two daugh
ters, and the big man had a voice big
ger than he was. When the curtain
went down on the first act there was a
slight scrap between the couple, "which
ended in the young man not going out
between the first and second acts, be- ,
cause the wait was short and he hadn't
time to argue. The girl's cheeks were .
redder than before when the curtain
went up and the set of her Jaw was
firmer. . â 
At the next fall of the curtain there
was a slight scrap again, which ended
this time in the young man dragging
himself over four people and leaving
the girl to sit alone until he was ready
to come back to her.
Two minutes later the girl dragged
herself after him, over the same four
people, but she stopped in the aisle long
enough to say something to the t>tg
man with the two daughters. Then she
disappeared.
It was a long wait, and just as the
curtain started up the young man hui
ried down the aisle, and was about to
drag himself over four people when the
big man called his attention to the va
cancy which had occurred during, his
absence. ,
The young man's Jaw dropped and he
actually grew red in the face.
The big man handed him a ring with
ji bright little diamond glistening in it. . .
"She gave me that and told me to .
?ive it to you," he said, with a menace .
n his tone, as he looked over at his own .
girls, "and she said if you ever came
to her house again or spoke to her her
father would thrash you as you de
served." ' .. â¢.
The young man was paralyzed.
"And I want to say," added the big
man, "that If the old man ain't able to
do it he can call on me."
Then he let the young man go, and
the way he went was a caution to a
flying machine.
It was a clear case of ships that pass
in the night, but with just a little more
Interesting cargoes than usual.âWash

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Nov. 26.â T0-day's short ses- 1
sion of the Stock Exchange was long enough j
for several uncertainties to develop and to re- .
serve themselves again, so that the session, as j
a whole, continued of the same irregular and |
mixed character as those of the whole week
have been.. The strength of Americans on the |
London market was not sufficiently pronounced
to affect the opening prices here and prices
were k.eiow the London parity, even where
gains "were shown. It was clear enough, how- j
ever, . that there was continued good demand I
'".for. Union Pacific and the St. Louis and San j
; â  ajranciscb preferred and Northern Pacific re- j
.'coWed'.a recovery of part of yesterday's de

' dent.- at other points and Manhattan suffered ;
. a break' of. 1% on published denials of a Van

' .on the. -threatened competition in cigarettes.
- .There were conspicuous fractional recession*
â  84So in the Baltimore and Ohio stocks and the |
â  "ci-*lers showed no oration over stories that i
' â¢â¢'file coal trade had been fixed." There was
. i.. ; 'ifjiich encouragement to bear operations In â 
such' .-a market, ana. when reports by cable were
' 're.cvi'veit- that- the Spanish Uovernnient had in
etructetf its commissioners to sign a treaty of
pi-;*ce the market generally turned upward and
quickly recovered a part or all of the earlier j
ueclines.- AtchiSOO's October statement helped
â  tteit company's preferred stock, and, by sym
pathy, the enUre list. The statement showed
v net increase of $21:7,437 saved out of the gross
Increase, it was announced incidentally that
the reduction- in operating expenses, due to
extraordinary expenditures for betterments,
would begin on December 1. Good statements
of- earnings by a number of other railroads
helped* the recovery. The bank statement was
considered a strong one at first glance, with j
the increase in surplus reserve, though sub- j
sequent scrutiny of the decrease In the loan
item caused some modification of this view and i
come' late reactions, but not until an active j
â¢ buying, movement had developed all through
' the list.
A midweek holiday Is almost certain to break
':" In on the course of' a market and to curtail
1 operations, except 6uch as are designed to
> â¢"even up" contracts. The past week was no
exception and the movement of prices has been
J highly irregular at all times, and at intervals I
Inclining toward the reactionary side. The ;
-.- aggressive attitude assumed by the Northern
â  Pacific toward Oregon Navigation in its policy
. Mo" extend into disputed territory has brought
â¢ large blocks of Northern Pacific stocks to the
. market from the disgruntled element in the
. ownership. The banking Interest, which seems

Profit taking in the Atchison securities was on

' "Inclination to sell. The strained relations

\V YORK. Nov. 26.â The Financier says:
bank >-t..totnent of averages for the week
g November 26 shows a decrease of $2.
) in loans and a gain of $764,300 in cub.
Â« loan contraction has affected the deposit
total, the reserve requirements have been les
sened, and this with currency receipts swelled
the surplus $1,090,200, making the excess above
legal reserve $18,357,575. The statement is con
fusing in several directions, but as It does not
cover the full week the probabilities are that
the conditions reflected do not prevail to-uay.
The banks have an unusually large amount of
money loaned on collateral as a result of ac
tive exchange transactions and borrowings in
cident to operations of syndicates in connec
tion with recent reorganizations and incorpo
rations, antl the Joan total, therefor*, is sus
ceptible to suddeir changes. The closing of sev
eral syndicate deals recently has returned a
great deal of money to banks, and this may
be regarded as a contributing factor toward the
fluctuations noted. Still, it is to be observed
that the decreases In one bank account almost
altogether for tlie changes In loans and de
posits tor the week. The international ex
change situation changed somewhat during the
week and the evident tend or sterline fore
shadowing smaller profits in investments has
lessened buying. The absorption of large quan
tities of sterling bills has contributed directly
and indirectly for some weeks past toward
lowing smaller profits in investments has
-ned buying-. The absorption of large quan
s of sterling bills has contributed directly
indirectly for some weeks past toward
swelling the loans of New York banks. The
loss of specie for the week, amounting to
$*>72,100 was due to operations with the treas
ury, representing the balance which the banks
owed en settlements and sums deposited for
telegraphic transfers to the South. The gain
in legals reflects the trend of money from the
Interior to this, center, although at the close
of the week it wan estimated that the banks
had lost nearly or quite as much as they
gained. The banks are increasing their circu
lation to an appreciable extent, the new 3 per
cent bonds being used as a basis. If the state
ment is to be regarded as typical of circum
stances controlling the money market the out
look might be said to favor easy conditions,
but as the close of the year usually creates a
demand for funds to be employed in dividends
and settlements it is not impossible that rates
may harden slightly. The constant outward
movement of cereals and manufactures Is add
ing to the balance owing this country abroad.
The only offset last week was selling of Ameri
can securities on German account, and when
this balance is to be collected Is uncertain,
but the next thirty days will show whether
loans to Europe are to be continued or called
for payment. '
THE LONDON MARKET.
I the next thirty days will show whether
b to Kurope are to be continued or called

THE LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, Nov. 26.â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says:
A sharp recovery in Kaffirs was the only
feature in the stock market here to-day. The
rise was stimulated by a shortage" in shares
at the settlement. Excepting for Baltimore
and Ohio and Union Pacific, Americans were
somewhat drooping, business probably being
checked because of the settlement to begin on
Monday next. It is belived that the carry
over may next. a considerable increase carry
may show a considerable increase in the
account, as it is expected that large lines will
be carried for Berlin.
The money position Is most perplexing. The
stringency in Germany increases, but with no
perceptible effect on discount rates here. It Is
believed that one important reason for this
position is the fact that New York is lending
largely to Berlin and moderately to London.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. Nov. 26.â Wheat opened at about
Friday's closing prices. May starting at 66%@
66% c. and December at 66% c. There was no ap
parent reason for the steadiness, and after
about half an hour's dull trading at about the
opening prices the market weakened percep
tibly, December selling off to 66%@66%c, and
May to CoVif366%c. December recovered a trifle,
but it was hard work to maintain prices. There
was no encouragement to holders in the early
news. Liverpool although unchanged for spot
wheat wan %!gl4c lower for futures. Weakness
of the coarse grain markets was an additional
Incentive to sell, and at times there appeared
to be no short Interest In the market for De
cember at least. Toward the close holders ap
parently became somewhat demoralized, and
May, though given fair support, was dragged
I down by the quick decline of the nearby fu-
I ture. Some recovery took place from bottom
figures, but the market was very weak at the
finish. May closing at 65 T i<a-6t>c, and December
at 65%Â®65%c.
Corn was relatively as weak as wheat. Cold
weather was the chief bearish factor. Some
i important lines of long corn were sold out. and
! short selling was prominent. May closed %@
i %c lower.
Oats were weak with wheat and corn. There
! was general liquidation and prices went stead-
I ily downward. May closed with a loss of %c.
The break in grain markets and unexpectedly
heavy receipts of hogs exerted a depressing In
fluence on provisions, and prices were a lit
! tle lower all around. Trading was not very
! heavy. At the close January pork and ribs
! were 5 c lower and lard 5Â©7% c lower.

1 Jacob Wollner's circular pays: "There has
i been a little more doing In this market. About
i 250. 000 pounds of spring, 150,000 pounds of fall
and 50,000 pounds of Nevada have been sold,
but at low prices. In Eastern markets the
sales In the last four weeks amount to about
one-quarter of the sales Bince the first of Jan
uary, with prices from 2 to 3c per pound less
than wools were held at live or six weeks ago.
Holders of wool are satisfied that they made
a mistake in the amount of wool or woolen
j goods carried over the first of January last,
i and therefore commenced to sell, although the
I woolen goods trade has not shown much lm
; provement.
"We now have enough wool In the United
j States to supply all demands for the next two
' rears to come, and with the new clip which :
| will b<> available In four or ttve months there i
; Foems to be little prospect of high prices in the j
near future.
"Of the wools that have been sold here the
prices were ll'S)2c for foothill spring, 86 9 c for
Southern spring, mountain fall 7<Â§Sc and Ne
vada 9igloc. At the wool sales held at Uklah j
800 bales were offered and sold from S\Â£<s??iHc. i
The demand here for wool is not very brisk. !
and it seems that when an offer Is refused It is ;
not repeated again except at lower price."

Harrison's circular says: "During the week
there have been five deliveries of coal fn-m
Washington, amounting to 14,330 tons; two ,
I from Oregon, 950 tons; one from Newcastle, N.
S. \\\. 3G30 tons; one from British Columbia,
2250 tons; total, 21,169 tons. This is a par
i tlcularly light week's delivery for this season
1 Of the year, when the demand is fully equal
I to 30,000* tons per week; still there is no actual
1 scarcity, as the yards are fairly well sup-
I piled. A good storm accompanied with a soak
; ing rain would force housekeepers to replenish
i their bins and double up domestic consump
! tlon. The existing coal freight rates from
: Europe and Australia show no decline, but are j
; firm at last week's quotations: they will prob- |
| ably remain as at present until our season's I
J weather shall have declared itself. A few
j new names have beon added recently to the J
I engaged list from Australia, but free engage- j
ments from that section cannot be looked for
until freights decline, as consumers here will
not pay asking prices, based on present
I freights, simply because they can purchase
i more economical fuel. Largo quantities of un-

GARNERED WISDOM.
In that world of books, the British
Museum library, thme are hundreds,
nay thousands, of volumes and manu
scripts which lay claim to possessing
rare interest, both to the antiquarian
and general reader; but it is doubtful
if any readers or students would ever
find it necessary in the course of their
investigation to consult the largest
book in the world, for it is written in
strange characters withal and most
sedulously guarded under lock and key
in the strongest of cases in the world
famed king's library section of the
museum.
It consists of 1150 volumes, the whole
constituting a Chinese dictionary,
which was compiled by imperial com
mission at Peking, and is dated 1726.
No one writer contributed the whole of
the words and definitions in this book,
but it was the work of many authors
for a number of years. The book was
purchased by the British Museum li
brary in 1878, and is a most valuable
acquisition to the long list of priceless
books in the possession of the British
Museum trustees.

HIS CLARIBEL
. . PART I.
rT"-\RINCESS HELEN was very
j 1 beautiful and it was said that
|"â ' none other was as handsome as
V she, with the exception of Clari
â¢*â  ' bel, who was the daughter of a
poor farmer. So lovely was Claribel
that Princes and Knights went woo
ing her, and Princess Helen, who was
very jealous, grew angry. Clarlbel's
mother was dead and she was cared for
by her grandmother.
None of the Princes or Knights suited
the fancy of the grandmother, who
used to say that Claribel should marry
only the young King of the neighbor
ing country who was so rich that his
horses ate from gold mangers, and
whose servants were dressed in cloth
of gold.
One day the young Kin-, whose name
was Valiant, sent out Alfred, a mes
senger, to find for him the handsom
est of all Princesses for his wife. This
messenger saw the Princess Helen and
was speeding back to his royal master
with the news that Helen was the love
liest of all, when his. horse fell and he
was hurt badly. For many days he
lay upon a couch, racked by pain, at
tended by Claribel, for she saw him
when he fell and had him brought to
her grandmother's house.
Alfred soon fell in love with Clari
bel and she loved him. When the
grandmother learned this she locked
i laribel in a dungeon and sent Alfred
9 .pen his way with many angry words.
King Valiant married Princess Helen
and her ambition was satisfied, but she
had such a bad temper that she made
the King very unhappy. One day she
said to the Kijng that there was one
Claribel, who lived in the next country,
who was a witch. The King had Clar
ibel seized and brought before him, but
v. hen he saw her beauty he called to
Alfred to answer why he had not told
him that Claribel was so lovely.
"By my father's beard," quoth the
King, "she would ha" been mv wife
had I known. Strike off her shackles
and set aside for her a large, sum of
gold, that she. may return to her home
in peace and live no. more in poverty,
for she is no witch."
Princess Helen beard and her. face
turned crimson with wrath. Not many
clays after Claribo! had departed Helen
sent out spies- to find Claribel and cut
off her lovely golden hair, which was
her chief beauty. But the old grand
mother hMd hidden Claribe! in a cave
and so Â£ha aped. Alfred .heard <.f
her peril -sod,- finding where she- was
hidden, broke down the iron gate to
the cave and carried her away in
triumph to a priest's, where they were
married. Together they went before
King Valiant and asked his favor.
Princess Helen saw them and urged the
King tn punish Alfred for daring to
- take a wife outside of the kingdom,
which was against the law for all men
except the" King. Helen was still jeal
ous of Clarlbel's beauty.'
The King did not wish to be cruel,
but, while he was talking with Prin
cess Helen, the old grandmother of
ClarLbel: who had been following Al
fred and his bride, arrived at the Pal
ace and asked for audience with the
King. â¢ . .
â¢""Know, O King," said the wicked old
woman, "that before Alfred returned to
tell you that Princess Helen was the
most beautiful of all. he had seen Clari
bel. He loved Claribel, whom I in
tended to offer as your bride, and Al
fred alone is at fault that she is not
your queen."
Then' was King Valiant angry, for
he saw clearly that not only was Clari
be] more. lovely than Helen, but that
she was amiable and kind, and he re
proached Alfred for lack of faith.
"But you shall have your Claribel,"
he said bitterly. "Henceforth You shall
dwell in a high and lonely castle with
her in the land of Giants. Never shall
either come forth from the castle alive."
Nor. . would he heed any appeal for
mercy. )':':-'.'
Alfred and Claribel were placed on a
. ship aS prisoners, and. after sailing
many days over a rough ocean, they
came .to- a rocky shore. Many miles
from' the shore stood the stone castle
In which they were to pass all their
day's .as prisoners. When the castle
gates were closed behind them huge
giants were placed at the gates for
, guards; that neither Alfred nor Claribel
might escape. .
"' They- were happy in their love after
â¢ a time..- There- were flowers in the
garden, fish in the streams, game In
â¢ the. forest and fruit of many kinds in
large orchards, and no one to disturb
them. They had enough to eat, and
in the â¢ castle they found books and
games. But they were not permitted
to forget that' they were prisoners.
; Every day, just as the castle clock
struck the hour of noon, a giant called
through the gate at them in a loud
'voice that was like thunder:
: Neither in life,
:.v": .v" Neither in death,
... Shall ye go forth forever !
,So they began to fear that one
PUZZLEâ FIND THE STONECUTTER'S CHILD.

BOYS` AND GIRLS` PAGE
might die and leave the other to drag
out existence miserably in solitude, to
old age. They grew sad with this
thought and Alfred planned, secretly,
to try to escape with Claribel, if pos
sible. Claribel first learned of this plan
when Alfred was asleep under a ban
yan tree. He talked aloud and Claribel
heard and she was so frightened that
she awoke him with her sobbing.
"Go not forth to sure death, my dear
Alfred," she pleaded. "If you were
dead I would die with grief. While we
are unhappy here, we are still together.
Let us remain and perhaps King Va
liant (will yet send for us, being sorry
for our sad fate."
Alfred did not believe that King Va
liant would repent and he would not
promise not to attempt to escape. Clar
ibel became so anxious that she would
not consent to have him leave her for
even a minute.
By and by the giants who guarded
the "gates began to think that King Va
liant would never send for his prisoners
and they demanded that Alfred should
open the gates and let them in. that
they might feast upon the fruit and the
fish and the game. Outside of the cas
tle vails the country was a barren wil
derness haunted by ferocious wild
beasts, who roamed over great pathless
masses of gldomy looking stone. The
giants had to battle daily with the
beasts for food and the cries of the
beasts, and the shouts of the giants
dreadful. Alfred turned a deaf
ear to the threats and requests of the
giants. But the new danger made him
hasten his preparations to go away.
First he made a tough yew bow and
many arrows, and tipped the arrows
with sharp barbs of fishbone. Then he
made a coat of furs and lined the in
side of the coat with pockets to carry
and drink for the journey; then he
picked herbs for medicines. When he
had made ready he told Claribel that
he would try to escape with her. See
ing that he was not to be dissuaded,
Ibel agreed to go with him.
''But how will you get past the
giants?" asked Claribel.
'To-morrow you shall see."
All that day Alfred busied himself
gathering fruits ;.nd the rarest flowers
and game and fish. Late into the night
the ovens of the castle roared, for Al
fred was making a great feast for the
giants. The tables fairly groaned with
weight of th<> good things that he
placed upon th^m : and when wreaths
of flowers, prepared by the dainty fln
gers of Claribel, were used to decorate
the banquet hall, and all the column*
were wound with greens and flowers,
and rare wines pparkled amid the nice
viands, it must be confessed that Al
fred and Claribel had provided well to
please the giantsâ for it was the pur
pose of Alfred to admit them to the
castle and to make friends of them, if
possible. He well knew that there was
gr^at risk in this: for the -iants, never
having had any friends, knew nothing
about friendship and they were even
more ferocious than the wild beasts
which roamed in the wilderness. But
Alfred had his plan prepared to repay
any treachery of which the giants
might be guilty.
When all was ready he requested
Claribel to dress in white and to place
a wreath of flowers upon her head, that
she might appear as beautiful as pos
sible. Then he caused her to stand at
the door of the castle to welcome the
giants when he should let them in.
"But, beware," he told Claribel, "do
not walk across the marble heart that is
inlaid in the floor of the banquet room.
I will act as the servant of the giants
and will wait at the table. Sit you only
in the chair that is covered with red.
Make no answer to anything that is
said: but make it appear, when any
question is asked you, that you are
dumb."
"Be sure, dear love," answered the
beautiful Claribel, "that I will do as
you have said, and I pray that the day
may not part us forever."
"Tut, tut, no tears," commanded Al
fred; "men do not like tears and your
beauty must be at its best to-day."
With that he went out and parleyed
with the giants, and they promised to
let him and Claribel go 'â th freely.

TWO CHILDREN.
BY ETHEL MAUDE COLSON.
One day when the sun was shining
And the. sky was a perfect i.-ue,
A little maid walked in a valley,
Where a sweet wild violet grew.
And the little maid, sighing, whispered,
"Were I but a blossom wild."
While the violet breathed, with its sweet
perfume,
"Now if I were a little child!"
Then the winds laughed softly o'er them,
And the fern-fronds, waving, smiled,
For the child was a flower of nature
And the flower was God's little child!
"My Bister's takin' music lessons,"
said little Mamie to a neighboring play
mate, aged 4. "My sister's takin' sum
fin' on ze piano," replied the other, "but
I tan't tell whezzer it's moosic or type
writin'."

QUEER STORY
OF THE OCEAN
By ALMAS S. BEMENDERFER.
WHEN Sam Parker disappear
ed from Clideville the older
people said he had run away
to see the world. His boy
friends thought him fortunate. But
this shows how little they really
knew about Sam. The fact is,
while out fishing one day he was
changed into a fish by a wicked fairy,
and after swimming about in the lim
pid waters of the Truckee he was
frozen into the ice, which was later cut
into blocks and sent to different places.
The one in which Sam was enclosed*
found its way to a coast steamer, where
the fish was cast overboard.
From this instant Sam's adventures
began. For when he came to look
around he knew he was in the Pacific
Ocean. It was a very different place
from Truckee River, and the swell was
so strong he was forced to swim quite
lively. Before he became accustomed

TO the Future, strange and dark,
Doth Life' 3 river flow;
In its stream the goodly bark
Of the long ago.
Now to me in memory
Comes another shore.
Where the waves beat cheerily
On a day of yore.
Spirit of a vanished hour!
Thou art with me yet!
Fa<*ed through each early flower
I cannot forget!
I had closed the schoolroom door
When my task was done,
Feeling, while my work was o'er,
It had just begun.
As I walked with drooping head
Thinking of the day,
Two nmall pupils, running, said,
"Let us go and play."
Happy thought! my dreaming fled!
Clasping hand in hand
Forth we went, with airy tread,
To the river's strand.
Skipping, dancing, up and down
The merry children flewâ
Mabel dear, with orbs of brown,
Blue-eyed Stella, too.
to this change he happened to swim
among some fish who made comments
upon his appearance; whereupon his
vanity was so touched, he declared he
was not a fish, but Sam Parker.
This caused the water to ripple and
the fish had to laugh. Hearing this a
large fish swam up and asked him to
desist, saying:
"If you ever were Sam Parker, you
are only a fish now. So do not excite
ridicule by boasting without founda-
Sam was so pleased with this logic
that he determined to make a friend of
the fish, and learning he was going to
the coast of Brazil, asked permission to
accompany him, which was granted.
By taking advantage of favorable
currents they were able to visit many
places of interest.
"The way to*manage," explained his
friend, "is to take time and be exact
about your bearings. Now I have actu
ally known fish who were so careless
they would get into currents that car
ried them quite out of their course,
and others who swam to such a depth
they could not live in any other wa
ters. Then again some fish like shal
low water. There is no accounting for
taste."
Sam being of a scientific turn found
much of interest. Taking advantage
of a chance to visit Manila, he swam
around Dewey's fleet and also explored
some of the narrow channels and la
goons. But hearing firing from the
shore, and narrowly escaping being
caught by Spanish fishermen, he left
for America, where the spell was
broken. These adventures being of
such an improbable nature, he has not
told his friends about them, and when
they ask him where he -went and what
happened to him, he only grins.
THE SECRET
FRANK KEPT
THERE was a crash that sounded
through the house, and mamma
ran to see what the matter was.
A moment later she reappeared
leading by the chubby little right
hand the pet of the family, little Frank,
aged 3. Tears were running down the
face of the curly-headed little prattler,
and there was a look in his bright eyes
that told that he knew he had been in
mischief. His white dress was streaked
with ugly black marks, and there were
suspicious stains of black upon both of
his hands. He was steered without de
lay, as the sailors might say, straight
for the washbowl. A little soap and
water took the black stains from his
hands, but left the dress marked up in
memory of his accident and his mis
chief.
"What were you doing, Frankie?"
asked the fond mamma,
"O-o-o-h, ink all spill and baby get
all black; dess all dir-r-r-ty."
"But what were you doing with the
ink?" persisted mamma.
"You love me, don't 00, mamma?"
"Yes, I love you, but tell mamma
what you were doing with the ink?"
"Won't do so any more, mamma."
"Sure you will leave the ink alone as
mamma told you?"
"Dcs, mamma, I'll be flood all the

time."
"But what happened, Frank?"
"O-o-oh, big, big sing with ink fell all
over and ink all spilled and I'se sorry,
mamma."
"But what made you touch the ink
when mamma told you not to touch
it?"
"Das a secret, mamma."
"Who knows about it?"
"Sandy Caws and me.
"Were you writing a letter to Santa
Claus?"
"Dcs, mamma."
"And what did you want him to do?"
"Turn down ohimmy and bing sings,
trane, and lotâ big, big lot canny, big
big dolly, cart, nice Ittie dum; Kismus
tee, big apple, nice new dess, new soos,

"What do you want Santa Claus to
bring you?"
"Das a secret, mamma."
"And you will not tell any one what
you want except Santa Claus?"
"No, mamma."
"Well, I guess that you want Santa
Claus to come down the chimney and
bring you a train and a lot of candy
and a big dolly and a cart and a little
Swift I ran along the sandâ
The children hurried after;
All around that sunny land
Rang the joyous laughter.
Roundabout I turn, and send
My pupils in a flurry;
Yet, before I may descend,
Off again they scurry.
"Ah! I have you now, at last!'"
"No, you axe mistaken !"
Four small arms are 'round me cast
I myself am taken.
Down they bore me to the ground.
Nor would I have risen;
It were pleasure to be bound
In so fair a prison!
Sitting there they prattled long
Of this and that grave(?) matter.
(Sweeter far than any song
Was that guileless chatter.)
But as thus the dear ones spoke
In their infant gladness
Surging thoughts within me broke
Like a wave of sadness.

"I go home to-nwrrow."
O'er those faces bright and gay
Came a cloud of sorrow.
drum and a Christmas tree, a big apple
and a nice rfew dress and a pair of new
shoes and some more nice things."
"Dcs, mamma."
But all the day long, until the curly
head went to his daily nap, he would
stop at times and say that his letter to
Santa Claus was a "secret," and he
would not tell any one, not even
mamma, what Santa Claus was going
to bring him; no, he wouldn't even tell
mamma.
AN ODD PRESENT.
BY MARGARET BYRNE.
ON Rebecca's ninth birthday her
aunt Rebecca gave her a present.
I think you would never guess
what it was, so I will tell you.
It was yarn, woolen yarn enough
to knit a pair of stockings. This was a
nice gift, as you see, and not so queer
as you may suppose, for it was eighty
years ago that Rebecca got this yarn
and enough of it to knit a pair of stock-
Ings was a fine present for those times.
Perhaps her aunt Rebecca spun the
yarn on the great spinning wheel they
had in those days. Now, Rebecca knew
how to knit, and with this yarn she
would knit a pair of stockings to sell,
and not for one of the family to wear.
Sale stockings must be knit very
strong, and Rebecca knit every stitch
herself, even to the heels and the nar
rowing of the toes. When they were
done the captain of a packet, who was
a friend of theirs, took them and sold
them for one dollar.
Rebecca was very proud when the
captain brought back the dollar and
gave it to her. Then the question
arose what she should do with the dol- ,
lar. Should she buy something to wear
or something good to eat, or would she
put it in the bank to grow? Rebecca
thought it over and talked about it.
One person would say do this and an
other do that.
Her uncle finally suggested a plan,
which was that she should buy a lamb
and then she would have wool of her
own, and after a while a big flock of
sheep. Rebecca liked this plan and
bought a lamb. The next year she
bought another, and in a few years she
had a flork of thirty sheep. They were
all great pets and very fond of Rebecca.
When she went to the field and called
them they would come running to her,
and even the little lambs would crowd
around her. Was it not a fine birthday
gift from which a flock of thirty sheep
could grow?
MY UNCLE FRANK.
By LAF SMITH
SAN FRANCISCO.
ONE rainy day Uncle Frank told
us a Btory. "I was on a gun
boat in the Mississippi River
during the Civil War," he said,
with Confederates all around us. There
uas a high levee along the bank, and
they got behind that to shpot at us.
One day my cousin Archie and I went
to burn up one of their houses. We left
a boat at the bank and started for the
house.
"I left Archie behind a tree and crept
forward alone. I found that there were
about one hundred men in it. Just as
I was about to light a match one of
the men came out. I shot at him and
then ran toward the boat with all the
other men following me. I barely es
caped and had tf leave Archie behind.
Stella paid, "You shall not go!"
With her lips a-fjulver;
Mabel, turning, murmured low
To the heedless river,
Saying faintly, "If you stay
We will tease you never;
On the bill, in happy play,
We can run forever!"
Pearest child! T could not speak,
But I gently kissed her,
Then I kissed the rosy cheek
Of her loving sister.
When at last I needs must start.
My departure takirtg,
Well T know each tender heart
Swelled to almost breaking.
And alas! I walk to-day
Lone and sorrow laden;
'Mid the mountains far away
Dwells each little maiden.
What to me Ambition's call!
What the sordid gold!
Gladly would I give my all
For one song of old!
Take thy harp, O elf of Time!
Sound the chords of yore!
Let that dulret music chime
With my heart once more!
He ran to the house, after they had all
gone. He set fire to the building and
then went on to the river, and there
found two Confederates who were try
ing to take the mail across. He cap
tured the mail and the boat; and that
was the last of that adventure."
Papa â You saw that big boy whipping
the little one, and you didn't interfere?
Suppose you had been that little boy?
Bobbie â I did think of that, an' was
gome; to part 'em, but then I happened
to think s'pose I was that big boy? So
I left 'em alone.
"Don't you think you have a goo.l
mamma to spread such nice, large
slices of broad with jam for you?"
asked little Ethel's grandma. "Oh, I
don't know," replied the little miss.
"She'd be a heap sight gooder if she'd
let me spread the jam myself."
A CAY NIGHT AT STOW LAKE.
MOONLIGHT upon Stow Lake at
Golden Gate Park. Moonlight
upon the fair surface of the Pa
cific Ocean, which, seen in the
distance, is bright as a great
shield of silver thrown down to reflect
the star-sprinkled sky. It Is quite late
and the last merry boating party has
gone home and the lake is deserted.
Deserted? What is that which attracts
the attention of Mr. Ohnimus, the
keeper of the boats? There is a reach
of water on either hand as he stands
and gazes over the lake. To the left,
as he faces toward the south, there is
dimly seen an arched bridge not very
far away. From the shadows that
cluster thickly around the bridge slow
ly there emerges something white and
glimmering, and at the same time the
lake boatman hears the measured
cadence of oars.
Looking about the float that fronts
the boathouse, Mr. Ohnimus counts his
boats and finds that none are missing.
Whose boat, then, is this and how did
it ever get upon Stow Lake without
his knowledge or consent? A thought
Hashes over him that the ' Park Com
missioners will inquire into this. Be
fore he can have a second thought upon
the subject he hears the sweetest music
that has ever pleased his ears. Stand
ing and listening he hears gay laughter,
ut out these five pieces and arrange them in the form of a Maltese cross.
which indicates that another boat of
mysterious origin is coming from the
opposite direction. Another and an
other â and now it is clear to him that
at least a score of boats are upon the
lake.
The first of the number is now near
the float, and in another minute the oc
cupants of it are ready to land. They
are the queerest people that ever have
been seen in the park. First there
stepped ashore a little girl who led by a
long blue ribbon a snowy lamb, which
bleats with evident joy, now that its
voyage is over.
"Let it go, Mary," says a gentle
voice, and before the boatman can in
terfere the lamb is nipping the well
kept turf about the margin of the lake.
"Ha, ha, ha," sounds a faint little
voice.
The next instant the air vibrates to
the sound of a silvery horn. At this the
lamb looks up a little bit alarmed, but
when it notices that the owner of the
horn is a very small and sleepy lad,
who is dressed in blue, it goes to eating
once more.
"Wake up, wake up, Little Boy Blue!"
calls out a later arrival, who wears a
hood of red, and who is known at once
as Red Riding Hood. She looks cau
tiously about to make sure that there
are no wolves in the park; then she
gives her attention to a dainty little
lady who is just alighting from a beau
tiful little carriage that has come un
noticed along the carriage drive to the
edge of the boathouse. As she steps to
the ground, being assisted by a brave
little prince, whose raiment is glisten
ing with diamonds and other rare gems,
a moonbeam touches her dainty slip
pers, and behold, they are of glass!
Cinderella stands there truly.
THE TALK O/="
THE GARDEN.
SOME trees and plants were one
day having a little talk together,
and telling their experiences. The
chestnut tree, which was the larg
est and oldest, said:
"Little did I think I should live to
grow so large and wave my branches
over the heads of boys and girls as they
gathered my fruit in the autumn, for
while I was still a green chestnut in
my prickly burr squirrels tried to pry
into my house; but the prickles were so
sharp they gave up in despair. Soon
Jack Frost came and I rattled onto the
ground. Then I expected to be picked
up and roasted, but winter found me
still lying there. The snow kept me
warm until spring; then it began to
rain, and I swelled up so my outer coat
burst and my little stem appeared. It
looked like a tail. I had kept it hidden
in my shell during the cold weather.
How glad I was when some boys picked
me up and planted me. The soil was
just what I needed to make me grow,
and here I am, a great big tree."
The cherry tree standing near said:
"I was afraid I never should live to
grow into a ripe cherry. At first I
was as green and unpalatable as you
can imagine. The robins and cedar
birds flew into my tree every day, they
were so impatient for me to ripen. The
robin pecked at me, but I was so green
and bitter that he flew away and
stayed until I was red and juicy. Then
I did not care If he did have a good
meal of me, for I knew I could grow
What is that queer-looking thing
that is cominp down out of the
Bky? Now it is like a speck; speedily
it grows larger; now it is clearly made
out to be an old woman who is riding
a broom through the air.
"Would have been here sooner, my
dears," said the old woman, in a crack
ed voice, "but the fact is that the cob
webs on the sky stick uncommonly
tight this season and I could not come,
until I had the sky spick and span."
Up the hill toiled another old woman,
leaning upon a staff. Her face was so
full of kindness that at once it was evi
dent that this was no other than Qld
Mother Hubbard. She carried her "poor
dog" in her arms and put him down
tenderly upon the grass while she went
into the boathouse to see if she could
not find him p ' one there.
The boats came faster arm faster, un
til all the landing, space of the float
would surely be needed to give aceorn
modation to all the unexpected visitors
to Stow Lake. There was a brave lit
tle man, whom all the others named
with respect, as he was Jack the Giant
Killer. Another was a boy, who had
a vine planted beside the boathouse in
a jiffy. This vine grew straight up
ward, and at such a prodigious rate
that Jack of the Bean Stalk, for it was
he, was soon out of sight, climbing up
it Little Boy Blue had to .be
awakened to blow his horn three times
before Jack would come down to join
the others in their merrymaking. -
One old woman â the one who used to
live in a shoe. and. had so many chil
dren that she didn't know what to do
âcame in a boat that nearly sank while
crossing the lake, her crowd of chil
dren filling it so full that it was very
hard work for the old woman to find
room to move the oars enough to row.
Prety soon the entire queer party
surrounded the boatman and clasping
hands, danced around him and sang all
about "Lon-on bridge is falling down."
and followed this up with '.'Ring a
round a-rosy, pocket full of posy" and
when they came to the part where "all
fall down," down they plumped, so
cunning and so charming that the
boatman could not but shout "bravo"
in sign of approval.
That was the very worst thing that
he could do. The whole throng van
ished like magic and he saw them no
more.
But this was not the end of the mat
ter. Several days later, still puzzled
over what he had seen and not quite
sure but that he had been dreaming,
Mr. Ohnimus walked to the top of
Strawberry Hill. Something thr.t glis
tened in the grass beside the path
caught his watchful eyes. He bent over
and picke#>. it up: and what do jfoti
think it wa-? Why. it was a pi> â 
giass, shaped just like the toe of .(hi?
smallest and daintiest slipper imagin
able. Now if that was not a piece of
the glass slipper of Cinderella, dropped
during her flight from the lakÂ«i. vvhat
was it? That is a question whir' the
children must answer, for I confess
that it is too hard for me.
just as well if he did. He could not
pry open my hard stone, and you kno\v
my stem and leaves were hidden in
there. One of the boys carried me to
the orchard just as I was sprouting
and planted me beside you."
Just then a tomato plant called over
the fence: "I never expected to grow
up either, for while I was still in a
green tomato a chicken came along and
began picking at the tomato. She ate
up some of my mates, but there were
so many of us she did not get to me.
The tomato ripened just the same and
was carried into the house, but was so
badly pecked that it would not do for
the table. The kind lady took us seeds
out and laid us away until spring. It
was fortunate that we were not left
on the ground as you w r ere, wasn't it?
for we had no strong covering like you
to protect us from the birds and the
weather."

STORY OP THE NEW
UNITED
CENTRAL AMERICA.
Continued from Page Eighteen.
forests of Honduras, Salvador and Nic
aragua. Salvador has had several en
'' counters with Guatemala, and Nica
ragua and Costa Rica are on especially
good terms. It has always been said
when the subject of the union of the
five republics was discussed that
j Guatemala was the key of the situation.
; The United States of Central America
look to the north and the south, and
; there is a chip on its shoulder. Let
Guatemala try conclusions with little
i Salvador, if she will, and there are Nic
aragua and Honduras ready to join the
fray. Let Costa Rica throw down the
gage of. war to Nicaragua, the United
i States of Central America will go into
the arena to pick it up.
Theoretically the five States are sup
posed to have a community of inter-
I ests; to be a greater republic, the mem
| bers of which are bound together by in
dissoluble ties. Revolution seems in
born in the body politic of these coun
tries.
The wars and internal disorders have
undoubtedly interfered with the pros
perity and progress of the republics.
While the United States of America
was building railroads, reclaiming the
wilderness and improving harbors Cen
tral America was pursuing the game of
revolution. War and intrigue, the cre
ation of governments .only to be over
thrown by the appearance of a few
hundred armed men have filled the life
of the people these many years. There
was a time when you might make your
way through Central America with the
simple direction: "Go south three revo
lutions and turn one revolution to the
right." Stability of government, the
completion of a ship canal, the ex
change of products with the United
States may work wonders in this land
I of change and shift.
Here is the oldest community on the
American continent and yet the last to
take to itself a government which gives
some sign of being an abiding one.
It was on this neck of land which Co
| lurabus set foot when he first reached
this continent. That was in 1502.
Twenty years passed by and then the
conqueror of Mexico â Hernando Cor
tes â hearing stories of the fabulous
wealth of the countries which lay be
low, started south with an army of
seasoned, mail-clad veterans.
He reached his destination after two
years of almost incredible hardship.
He conquered Guatemala. The natives
' were slaughtered by the thousand. The
', conqueror or his lieutenants possessed
â¢ the land. Granada, in Nicaragua, was
founded and a civilization was built up
on this continent which the Spaniards
had largely learned from the Moors.
In Granada many of the old buildings
still stand.
All the countries of Central America
were united under the name of Guate
mala and a captain general presided
over them. Those who have followed
the history of Spain know how the
proud old land ruled her Central Amer
ican possessions. The native race was
decimated under the hardships imposed
by their conquerors. The labor on the
plantations and the toil In the mines
brought death. Europeans and negroes
were brought to the country.
Then Mexico gained her freedom.
Then the Central American provinces
of Spain demanded independence and
in 1821 they received it. The Federal
Union of Central America was founded
in 1823, and until the close of 1839 it
held the five States together. The
States withdrew one by one.
With this period the name of General
Morazon will always be associated. He
was one of the founders of the union.
Even after it had gone to pieces he
tried to join together the fragmentsâ
to get the blocks which formed this
puzzle of five into regular order again..
He was shot at San Jose, in Costa Rica,
in 1842, whithtr he had gone to attempt
a coup in the interest of a unified Cen
tral America.
Several efforts have been made since
that. Unrest was the leading trait in
the political character of these repub
lics. Revolutions sprang up from time
to time in all of them. It was charged
by each republic that its neighbor or
neighbors were giving aid to the revo
lutionists which she had expelled from
her borders. Less than a year ago Nica
ragua came very near going to war
with Costa Rica on account of such a
charge. Her President imprisoned a
Costa Rican Consul at Managua.
Troops were marched to the frontiers
and a treaty of peace was finally
signed. , .
An unsuccessful effort was made by
Guatemala in 1885 to effect a union of
the States. General Justo Rufino Bar
rios came very near forming an organi
zation in 1885. He discovered that bal
vador was treacherous and marcnea
against it. He conquered the baiva
doreans, but fell a victim to sharp
shooters. By treaty concluded at
Amapala in 1896 atf five of the republics
formed a federation, which was called
the Greater Republic of Central Amer
ica. It amounted to little more than an
agreement to leave questions in dispute
to a diet of deputies appointed from the
various republics. It will, of course.
be superseded by the formation of the
United States of Central America.
Diplomacy has sought to do every
thing possible to restrain Jealousy and
dissatisfaction in this new nation. The,
Presidents of the States become Gover
nors. It has been agreed that none of
them shall become a candidate for
President of the new republic, who will
be chosen on December 13. The success
ful candidate will be inaugurated next
March. The new capital, Chirandega,
is in Nicaragua, on the Pacific side.
If the resources of this new nation
were properly developed it would be
come a rich and peaceful nation. The
forests of all three of the countries are
rich in mahogany and dyewoods; sold
and silver have been found, there is an
abundance of coal, and there are for
tunes in coffee and tropical fruits. The
future of this trio of republics depends
in a large measure as to what policy
may be pursued with regard to the Ni
caraguan canal. The present conces
sion expires next year. The United
States of America, it will be remem
bered, sent a delegation of officers and
engineers under Admiral Walker to
make an examination of canal routes.
It is proposed to use the San Juan
River, the boundary between Nicara
gua and Costa Rica, and Lake Nica
ragua as a part of the proposed water
way across Central America.
Nicaragua is as large as the gToup
of States including Maine. Massachu
setts, Connecticut and Rhode Island.
Honduras is about the size of Ohio.
Salvador is one hundred and forty miles
long and sixty miles in breadth.
