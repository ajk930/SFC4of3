THE NATION'S VOICE
FOR WAR WITH SPAIN
SPANIARDS FEEL
CUBA IS LOST
TO THEM NOW
They Will Not Surrender Their
Hold Upon the Island With- |
out a Hard Fight.
â  .^t^.!. IBM. by James Gordon Bennett.
MALRID, April 18.â All eyes are
directed toward Washington to-day.
It is felt that the Cuban question has
entered upon its last stage, and that
the chance for a peaceful solution is
a very slender one. namely, whether
the House stands firm and keeps to
its non-committal attitude or allows
itself to be influenced by the example
of the Senate.
The way this nation regards the
question is shown by the fact that
now the resolution of the House is
felt still to leave a loophole for a
peaceful settlement, whereas only a
short time ago such a resolution
would have been looked upon as
equivalent to a declaration of war.
This change in sentiment has been
further helped by the speeches of
Senators Wellington and White.
There is really no bellicose feeling
here in administration circles.
Neither is the feeling a sullen one
in bowing to the inevitable. It
seems, however, to be felt that war is
being forced on the country, and that
it could not be avoided, no matter
what sacrifices were made.

SPANISH TORPEDO DESTROYERS UNDER SAIL.
SPANISH FLEET
STRIPS FOR ACTION.
ST. VINCENT. Cape Verde Is
lands, April 18. â Should war be
declared the Spanish fleet, con
sisting of the cruisers Cristobal
Colon and Infanta Maria Teresa,
the torpedo-boat destroyers Ter
ror, Pluton, Ariete, Rayor and
Azor, now anchored in this har
bor, will leave at once for Cuba.
On all the ships the utmost rest
lessness prevails among officers
and men, because of the uncer
tainty as to the time for action.
No shore leave is being granted
to any man on the ships, as it is
expected that word to move may
come at any moment.
The cruisers Vizcaya and Al
mirante Oquendo, which sailed
from Porto Rico, are expected to
join the fleet here by Wednes
day.
The vessels here now are
stripped for action and ready to
sail at a moment's notice. The
Spanish transport San Francisco
arrived here this afternoon, hav
ing on board a cargo of coal in
tended for the Spanish squadron.
Every one appears to realize that
Spain's actual hold on Cuba is lost,
but at the same time the people are
united in a determination to cling to
the sentimental bond that still ex-
ists between the mother country and
the island. Ido not think any one
really hopes to keep that bond intact
should war break out, but all are
determined to make the victory of
the Americans a dearly purchased
one.
A Spaniard, who has large inter
ests in Cuba, said to me to-day: "I
hold that the Government ought to
give Cuba the broadest liberty, but
I would fight heart and soul against
giving up the nominal hold on the
island. If war comes, you may bo
sure it will not be a short one. Not
only will you have our forces and
the loyal Cubans to fight againstâ
, both bodies acclimatized and inured
to hardshipâ but you will also have
to contend with the natural difficul
ties of the place, with the rainy sea
son that will shortly begin and with
the fever that is epidemic there."
There were renewed disturbances
| at Valencia yesterday in which the
women participated. Before order
was restoreu the gendarmes were
compelled to make two charges upon
the mob.
Although Sunday morning passed
quietly at Barcelona, there was a
demonstration last evening when the
crowds which gathered in front of
the newspaper offices read the latest
announcements of the action taken
by the United States Senate in re
gard to Cuba. After it became
knovni that the Senate had adopted
a resolution favoring the recognition
of the. present Cuban insurgent (*ov
ernment, there was a scene of the
greatest excitement, and patriotic
shouts were raised on all sides.

DYNAMITE ROMB
AT A CUBAN CHURCH.
An Explosion Causes the Death of
Three Persons and Serious In
jury to Others.
Copyrighted. 189S, by James Gordon Bennett.
HAVANA, April 18.â Latest advices
from Alfonso Doce are that the explo
sion of a dynamite bomb took place at
the Church of San Francisco de Paula
at 8 o'clock last night. It occurred at
the main entrance. Those killed were:
Jose Larino, sacristan. and Tuan
Growcs. Ramon Fondora, a child,
was so seriously injured that he died
soon after. Pedro Dago, a policeman,
and Luis Perez, child, were also
wounded.
The usually peaceful neighborhood
was terribly frightened by the noise of
the explosion and people- crowded
about the scene, stupefied at the first
sight of the mangled bodies and de
struction wrought.
The church doors were smashed to
pieces, and also several images. The
explosion greatly damaged the main
wall of the church. The windows and
glass in the doors of the house of Dr.
Fucntes in Adams street, near the
church, were blown out.
The whole community is denouncing
with the greatest indignation the per
petrators of this horrible crime.

WASHINGTON, April 18. â The resolutions as agreed on by
both houses of Congress are as follows:
Resolved, By the Senate and House of Represantatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled â
First â That the people of the island of Cuba are and of
right ought to be free and independent.

and the Government of the United States does hereby demand,
that the Government of Spain at once relinquish its authority and

Third â That the President of the United States be and he

as may be necessary to carry this resolution into effect.
Fourth â That the United States hereby disclaims any dispo
sition or intention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction or control
over said island except for the pacification therof, and asserts its
determination when that is accomplished to leave the government
and control of tho is/and to its people.

to use the United States land

He preferred the House reso

further negotiations before
adopting the extreme course
of using the military and na

The only possible escape
now from war would be a
treaty of peace between Go

pairs to which are being pushed
at the Norfolk and Mare Island
navy yards respectively, are
Lieutenant-Commander W. H.
Turner, who will be executive
officer cf the former vessel, and
Lieutenant-Commander G. Elock

position on the Charleston.
It is practically decided that
Captain Henry Glass, captain
of the Mare Island Navy Yard,
will be placed in command of the

The Newark is a prize for
which several officers ranking as
captain are struggling. No de
cision was reported up to the
close of office hours to-night as
to who will have command of
this vessel.
considers that the declarations
in the resolutions are clearly
within the province of Con
gress, and that as the respon
sibility for war rests upon that
body he will carry out its
declaration to the letter.
Under the terms of the^
resolution he is first required
to demand that the Govern
ernment of Spain at once re
linquish its authority and
withdraw its land and naval
forces from Cuba and Cuban
waters.
It is expected that he
will immediately ap

SQUADRON TO
PROTECT THE
COAST CITIES
Corr)n)odore hjowell Will Con)n)and
Cruisers to Be Used as a
Patrol.
NEW YORK, April IS.â A Washington special to the Herald says:
Thi- seaports of the Atlantic coast of the United Statesareto be protected
third squadron formed to-day by orders issued by Secretary Long.
This Bquadron has been officially designated "The Patrol Squadron,"
and Its commander-in-chief will be Commodore J. A. Howell, former
ly commander-in-chief of the European station. The cities of the coast
which will be provided with protection by this force may thank Captain
A. S. Crowninshield, Chief of the Bureau of Navigation, for its forma-
Lfi it was he that bo strongly urged upon the department theneces-
Bity of keeping Cjmrnodore Howell afloat with a command which
would enable him to prevent any cruisers of the Spanish navyattempt
destroy property along the coast. The final decision to organize
a licet was reached at a conference between the Secretary and his
Chief of Bureau of Navigation to-day, although it has been a matter
of considei ission for several days.
It is understood thai the cruisor San Francisco will be retained as
hi;.. l::.1 that other vessels which will be as
l to In- command will be the auxiliary cruisers Yosemite, Prairie,
, Dixie. On account of the necessity of converting these
it will In? impossible for Commodore Howell to collect his fleet
weeks. As soon as it is formed it will be the duty of the
r-in-chief to do as the official name of his squadron indi
patrol the coast and be ready to strike an enemy the moment
hed to him that a vessel flying the yellow and red
flag of Spain is nearing port for the purpose of attack.
What will probably be a matter of no small interest and import
ta "f New York is the fact that New York is recognized
us the headquarters of the squadron. One reason why officials do not
desire to send the squadron south with Commodore Howell in com
mand is the fact that his rank is senior to that of Commodore W. S.
Bchley, commander-in-chief of the flying squadron, which is at Hamp
ton Roads, and of Captain W. T. Sampson, commander-in-chief of the
North Atlantic Bquadron, stationed at Key West.
The formation of the patrol squadron is indicative of the purpose
of tin- nt to employ the North Atlantic and flying squadrons
solely for offensive purposes. Essentially a home squadron will be
Commodore Howell's force.
As the Herald stated, four naval militia organizations will be or
dered to duty on board the auxiliary cruisers as soon as war breaks
ons to tins effect have been sent to the militia selected.
New York naval militia will man the Prairie, which will be commandedby
;. â  i- T. '""iiin; Massachusetts militia, the Yankee, command
ed by Commander W. B. Brownson; Maryland militia, the Dixie, com
manded by Commander C. H. Davis; and Michigan militia, the Yo-
Bemite, commanded by Commander W. H. Emory.
fully convinced that Spain will
bluntly and indignantly spurn the
proposition, if she does not go fur
ther at once and formally declare
war.
The Spanish Cortes Is to meet on
Wednesday. By that time Spain
will have the ultimatum of this coun
try. It is confidently expected that
the Cortes will at once respond with
an appropriation for carrying on the
war. This will bring the United
States face to face with the alterna
tive in the resolution requiring the
President to use the entire land and
naval forces and to call the militia
into service for the purpose of driv
ing Spain from the island.
It is true that the President is not
bound to any specific time within
which to comply with this provision
of the resolution, but the act clearly
implies that Spanish sovereignty
over the island must end at once.
Unless, therefore, the unexpected
happens, the President's plans for
forcible intervention ought to be put
into practical effect within a week or
ten days, if not earlier.
I was assured by a
member of the admin
istration to=niÂ£ht that
the naval forces would
be on the move in less
than a week.
It remains to be seen, however,
â¢whether any further action will be
taken than the blockade of the ports
of Cuba and Porto Rico within that
time.
Although the authorities had had
every reason to believe Congress
would authorize forcible interven
tion, it is nevertheless true that they
have not fully determined upon all
the details of the campaign or as to
the time when military and naval
operations will actually commence.
There is a difference of opinion among
military and naval authorities about
the time for landing the army of oc
cupation on the island of Cuba. The
original plan of the President when
he first recommended forcible inter
vention contemplated the dispatch-
Ing of several vessels laden with re
lief supplies for the suffering Cubans,
under convoy of an American fleet.
This is still, In part, the programme,
but the question of landing a large
body cf troops to successfully cope
v/ith the Spanish forces on the island
is now involved. This point has not
as yet been settled. In the first
place, the army is not prepared for
the immediate occupation of Cuba.
Borne of the military leaders insist
that we should not send less than
100.000 men to Cuba, and that as it
will take at least six weeks, if not
two months, within which to thor
oughly organize and equip an army
for service in Cuba, it will be better
to postpone active military operations
In the island until October. The
damage to an army from yellow fev
er, if landed in the island in the
midst of the rainy season, is a mat
ter causing serious concern to the au
thorities. They realize, however,
that Congress, by its action to-day,
has forced the President to act at
once, and. as war is no respecter of
time and conditions, we may be com
pelled to iand our men in Cuba in
the midst of the rainy season, no
matter what the consequences may
be.
General Lee -wants the President
to act at once. He talks as though
It would be merely child's play to
land an army of twenty or thirty
thousand men in Cuba after our ships
have silenced the fortifications in
Havana with our great guns, and
this force will be able to complete
ly rout the Spanish soldiers from the
Island and return to this country be
fore yellow fever sets in.
This, however, is an optimistic
view which is not shared by the mili
tary authorities. One of the plans
of campaign prepared by the War
Department contemplates the block- :
ading of the ports of Cuba by our i
naval vessels and the dispatching of
munitions of war and food supplies
to the insurgents, in order that Gen
eral Gomez and his men might keep
up the war against the Spanish sol- |
diers until autumn, when an army
could be landed from this country
and peace, consequently, restored
without endangering the lives of the |
soldiers from disease.
These are matters still to be con
sidered by the authorities before
definite decision is reached as to the !
time for the occupation of Cuba. In
any event, all the authorities agree
that it will be impossible to get an
army fully organized and equipped
and transported to Cuba within less
than a month or six weeks.
Congress is still to act on the army
bill, which will bring the regular
army up to a strength of 40,000 men, |
; and the National Guard bill, giving
the President authority for organiz- i
ing military forces to a strength suf
ficient for the purpose in view. The
navy is in much Letter condition for
immediate service. In fact, our fleets
are in such condition that they could
, sail at once, and, indeed, it is under
stood that the navy will, in a very
few days, begin operations.
KEY WEST AND PUNTA
RASSA CABLE CUT.
Seemingly the Work of Some
Enemy of the United States
Government.
KEY WEST, Fla., April 18.â It WU
learned to-day that the cable between
Key West and Punta Rassa had been
cut about two miles this side of Saibel
Island, about 117 miles from Key
West. The matter was kept secret
and the break has been repaired. The
; incident looked suspicious, as the bro
ken end of the cable showed that it had
| been cut clean through, though the
rupture might have been accidental, as
! the water is shallow where the break
; occurred and the anchor of some yes
; sel may have become entangled in the
i cable.
Captain Sampson learned of it to-day
; and wired the Navy Department at
I Washington. It has been decided to
, establish a careful guard in those
i waters and any suspicious craft will be
â  summarily deaJt with. The revenue
I cutter McLean has already been sent
i on patrol there. The matter is of the
i utmost importance as the cables be
| tween here and Punta Rassa are the
. only communication with the mainland
I and if it were interfered with at this
! time the consequences could not be
! foretold.
BUTCHER WEYLER MAY
COMMAND IN CUBA.
Madrid Newspapers Outspoken, in
the Belief That He Will Bo
Appointed.
LONDON, April 18.â The Madrid cor
respondent of the 'Daily Telegraph
says: Several influential and out
spoken journals believe that in the
event of war Lieutonant-General Wey
ler will be placed in chief command of
Cuba. I learn a member of the Cortes
intends to make a proposal in that I
sense, but it is questionable whether it !
has any hope of success.
It is possible that an attempt will be '
made when the Cortes meets to replace :
the present Cabinet by a more ener-
Ketic administration in order that the
conduct of the war may be in stronger
hands.

THE BAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 19, 1898.
INFANTRY AND
ARTILLERY READY
All Arrangements Made for the Trans
portation of tr;e Regulars to New
Orleans and ChicKamauga.
The forward movement of the troops
from the Presidio will begin to-day.
Orders issued yesterday by General
Shafter direct that the train carrying
the light batteries of the Third Artil
lery shall leave the Ookland mole at 5
p. m. to-day. The artillerymen are un
der orders to commence loading their
baggage at 7 o'clock this morning. The
field guns, caissons and battery equip
ment genez-ally will be placed aboard
the cars at Kings-street platform.
When the work of loading is completed
the men will form and march to the
ferry landing at the foot of MJa>*ket
street.
The infantry column, under command
of Colonel Evan Miles, First Infantry,
will leave the Presidio for New Or
leans to-morrow afternoon. The exact
time of departure may be announced
to the public to-morrow morning. The
route of march will be along Lombard
street from the reservation to Van
Ness avenue, along Van Ness to Golden
Gate avenue and along" the latter ave
nue to Market street and down Market
to the ferry. The same line of inarch
is prescribed for the artillery leaving
to-day.
The light artillery battalion leaving
San Francisco to-day for Chickamauga
Park, near Chattanooga, will be com
manded by Captain Ramsay D. P<>Us,
Light Battery F. He will be accom
panied by First Lieutenant John P.
Hams and Second Lieutenant E. P.
O'Hern. Light Battery C will be com
manded by Captain Joseph M. Califf.
He will be accompanied by First
Lieutenant Archibald Campbell and
Second Lieutenant R. P. Gardner.
At least once in every twenty-four
hours the command will , ause to en
able the artillerymen to water and
groom their horses. The trip to Chat
tanooga may therefore occupy six days
time.
Light Battery C is the old organiza
tion of Mexican war fame. It was com
manded by captain t>ragg. When the
battle of Buena Vista was hottest Gen
eral Zachary Taylor rode over to the
guns and gave the order which history
quotes as "A little more grape. Captain
Bragg." What the general really did
say was "Give 'em hâll,h â 11, Captain
Bragg."
Yesterday Lieutenant Colonel Wal
lace F. Randolph, Third Artillery, re
ceived telegraphic advices from the
Secretary of \\ ar that an order assign
ing him to a command at Chickamauga
had been issued several days ago. It
4s now known that a very Important
command has been given to Colonel
Randolph. It is the judgment of army
officers who keep well posted that
Colonel Rondolph will have command
of all the light batteries of the First,
Second, Third, Fourth and Fifth Ar
tillery Regiments. Before he was pro
moted to the grade of lieutenant colonel
he was in command of the light artil
lery battalion at Fort Riley, Kan.
Colonel Randolph is an officer of re
nown. He has a brilliant record for
heroism on the field of battle and is
recognized as one of the ablest and
most progressive artillery officers in the
service.
The following officers and civilian
employes will leave Thursday night on
the Sunset Limited for New Orleans:
Brigadier-General William R. Shatter.

General Merriam, who is to tempo

The Southern Pacific Company has
secured the contract for transporting
the troops from this city to New Or
leans and Chickamauga Park. Bids
were opened by the department quar
termaster, Colonel Moore, yesterday at
noon, and it was found that the bid
of the Southern Pacific Company was
at least $5 lower than that of any of
the others on the rate for the men,
while its bid for the freight was near
ly up to the regular tariff.
The Southern Pacific, Union Pacific,
Rio Grande arid Western and the Mis
souri Pacific were the only bidders.
As near as could be figured out the bid
of the Southern Pacific was $40 a man
and $2MJ a car for freight; the figures
from the other roads were about $45
a man and regular rates for freight. In
addition to its rales the Southern Pa
cific promised a schedule of ninety-one
hours to New Orleans and fifteen hours
from there to Chickamauga. C. J.
Wilder represented the Southern Pa
cific at the opening of the bids, D. W.
Hitchcock and E. M. Shoemaker the
Union Pacific, W. H. Snedaker the Rio
Grande and Western and L. M.
Fletcher the Missouri Pacific.
The call far bids asked for trans
porting for 21 officers and 478 men for
New Orleans, and S officers and 150 men
for Chickamauga. Those for New
Orleans are the infantry companies and
the 150 for Chickamauga include two
batteries of light artillery.
The troops will be transported on
two trains, each run in two sections.
In the first train will be twenty-two
cars carrying the light batteries, and
in the second will be forty-eight cars
carrying the First Infantry. Tha men
for Ohickamauga will start first, and
the infantry will follow to-morrow. Thu
trains will be rushed through as fast
as possible.
There was no unusual commotion at
the Presidio last night. The men are
ready to march and eager for the con
flict. An infantryman said last even
ing: "If it were left to the vote of the
First Infantry whether we should have
war or not every man would vote for
a war. There has not been a single
desertion since the order came for the
regiment to go to the front. One man
who went away a few days ago had
to get out because he owed more money
than he could pay. Two that left some
time before* went to the Klondike. The
men arc weary of the monotony of life
in the barracks. They all want the
excitement and activity of a campaign
and will take the danger along with
the excitement. If the war scare should
blow over now several of the men
would Jump out for the Klondike at the
first opportunity. Now that there is
a chance of a lively campaign every
man wants to get to the front and see
what is going on."
The instruments of the First Infan
try Band are not packed away for
shipment, but will be carried to New
Orleans by the bandsmen. The band
will play tunes while marching through
Pan Francisco and one of the tunes
may be "Dixie," as the leader has had
a special request to play that tune
which is so dear to the Southern heart.
Several policies of life insurance have
been Issued to army officers who have
been ordered to the front. Yesterday
a prominent officer took out a policy
for $10,000. He said that no extra
premium was charged on account of
the war risk and that there was no
condition in the policy against his de
parture from the United States.

The following circular was issued
yesterday:
SAX FRANCISCO, April IS. IS9S.
To Principalsâ Ladies and GentlfniPn:
The occasion of the passing through the
city, en routo to New Orleans, of the
United Bt&tea troops, commanded by
General William K. Sharter, has been
deemed a fitting oiip to impart a lesson
of patriotism and love of country to the
children of our public schools, the men
and women of the future, now under our
care.
Further orders will be forwarded you
if time- permits, if otherwise, publicity
will be given through the daily press re
garding time of departure and line of
march. In the absence of further orders,
upon notice as above, you will assemble
your pupils along the route to be fol
lowed, displaying as far as possible all
flags belonging to your school and to the
separate classes thereof.
It might be well to request children hav
ing at home small flags which can be
carried in the hand to bring such flags
to school upon the first opportunity, so
as to be ready to march whenever the
occasion may demand.
(This must not be so construed as to
require the purchase of any flags or
bunting by the children.)
Particular efforts must bo made to in
sure the safety and comfort of ail pupils
under your charge. Very respectfully,
CHARLES L. BARRIXfiTON.
President of Board of Education.
Although there is really nothing for
the National Guard to do but wait,
still the time of waiting is not being
spent in idleness. There are prepara
tions going on all the time under the
surface that the rank and file know
nothing about. Ammunition Is being
brought to the city almost by the car
load and is being distributed among the
various commands and stored in out
of-the-way places ready to be brought
forth the minute it is wanted. There
are now in the city several hundred
thousand rounds, enough to last a long
campaign.
A conference was held yesterday be
tween Colonel Shafter, U. S. A., and
General Mckinson and General Bar
rett, N. G. C, and it is understood
that the principal subject of discussion
was the organization of light batteries
from the troops of the National Guard
and the furnishing of such troops with
modern high-power guns by the Gov
ernment. There is at present no light
artillery in the guard, and it is thought
to be a wise thing to supply the de
ficiency as soon as possible.
Major J. Wallace F. Diss, inspector
of the First Brigade of the National
Guard of California, arrived in the city
yesterday. When he goes to Salinas
and inspects Captain Burkes troon of
cavalry his to-ur of duty as inspector
will be finished. He finds the First
Brigade in fine condition.
Carlton W. Seeley, clerk in the money
order division of the Postoffice, and
Edward E. Harrison, mailing clerk,
have asked Postmaster Montague . for
a leave of absence until the close of the
expected war with Spain. Mr. Seeley
is a member of the First Regiment o*f
Infantry. N. G. C. Mr. Harrison served
In the artillery arm of the service iji
the regular army, and because of Ris
good record was allowed to resie-n be
fore the expiration of his term of ser
vice to accept a position in the Post
office. He is a well-drilled artillery

wanted by the Government in this
emergency.
MADRID LOOKS TO
M'KINLEY FOR DELAY.
Believes He Will Not at Once Sign
the Resolution Adopted by-
Congress.
MADRID, April 18.â El Correo (Min
isterial) says:
It is reported from Washington that
in the event of the Senate's resolu
tion prevailing President McKinley will
avail himself of his privilege of ten
days ere giving the resolution his ap
proval, provided he does not employ the
actual veto. Amid much excitement
the vote of war with Spain prevails in
Washington, but further delays will
probably occur, owing to parliamentary
routine or President McKinley's vacil
lation.
El Epoca (Conservative), discussing
the question of privateering, says:
Spain cannot be lawfully prevented by
Europe from employing the right, hav
ing reserved her liberty of action at
the time of the declaration of Paris.
ROUGH RIDERS^ FROM
THE ARIZONA RANGES.
PHOENIX, April IS.â Governor Mc-
Cord is deeply interested in the forma
tion of Colonel Brodie's regiment of
Arizona rough riders. To-day he tele
graphed the President as follows:
"I beg to remember that Arizona was
the first to offer to the Government a
regiment of cavalry recruited from the
cowboyi of the Southwest. The regi
ment can be ready for muster in u-n
days and will be an honor to the Terri
tory and to the nation. Please Rive
me authority to raise such a regiment
outside of our quota of volunteers to be
called for."
MARINES THE
FIRST TO LAND
ON CUBAN SOIL
Cruisers Panther and Badger to
Be Used as Transports for
the iQVadiQg Force.
NEW YORK, April 18.â A Washington special to the Herald says:
United tates marines will be the first body of American troops to at
tempt a landing on Cuban soil. In accordance with an order issued by
Secretary Long, the auxiliary cruiser Venezuela, renamed to-day the
Panther, and the Yumuri, which hereafter will be the Badger, have been
set aside for duty as marine transports. Colonel Charles Heywood,
commandant of marines, has directed the formation of a battalion,
which will be ordered at once to the Panther, and that vessel will pro
ceed, without delay, to Key West, where she will join the North Atlan
tic squadron. A second battalion will be transported to Key West by
the Badger. When Captain Sampson receives orders to attack Havana,
the Panther and the Badger will accompany the squadron, and the ma
rines aboard will effect a landing at such pc-int as may be deemed advis
able.
In order to form the battalion Colonel Heywood has been compelled
to draw on the Marine Guards now at the several navy yards, and
a second battalion will probably be formed from enlistments which he
will be authorized to make. The battalion to be transported by the
Panther will be commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel R. W. Hunting-ton.
It will comprise 415 men and about fifteen officers. Captain Charles Mc-
Cawley, assistant quartermaster, will accompany the battalion.
The action of the administration in giving the honor of making the
first attack to the navy and marine corps shows how much it is pro
posed to rely on the naval branch of the * .eminent service to carry
out the wishes of Congress. The army will support the navy and will
follow up any advantage that may be gained by the men-of-war a.-d the
marines.
I understand that the order of the department contemplates the
assignment of a guard of forty marines and one officer to each of the
auxiliary cruisers purchased by the Government.

SANTA CRUZ, April IS.â While in
San Francisco Colonel W. H. Lamb,
Mayor-elect, had a consultation with
Governor Budd and General Dickinson
In reference to the protection of Santa

pointed out that the powder works
would be a *>oint of a. tack by the
enemy. Troops could be landed here
and march into San Jose and San

women and men in evening dress filled
the galleries until the close of the pro
ceedings. When finally the verdict
came from the Conference Committee
there was a hush in the great chamber,
which a few seconds before had been
thrilling 1 with animation. When the
verdict had been rendered and ac
cepted by the Senate the great audi
ence dispersed, quietlyâ almost solemn
ly. All realized that the verdict meant
war, and the action was too momentous
to inspire anything 1 less than awe.
As soon as the decision of the House
became known in the Senate .the Senate
chamber became the scene of many ani
mated conferences. The leaders of the
Democrats. Populists and Silver Repub
licans got together and immediately the
word was passed around to non-concur
in the J louse amendment and not to
agrve to a conference, thus throwing the
responsibility for delay on he House.
At 1:35 p. m. the Republican Senators, i
with the exception of Wilson, who voted
originally to insert the Turpie resolution, â 
went into conference to decide upon a i
line of action, in Senator Quay's room.
Ton wore present; els Follows: Baker,
Chandler, Foraker, Gallinger, Mason,
Nelson; Pen rose, Perkins, Quay and j
Thurstor:. All decided to toil against
concurrence.
At 2:. Vi p. m. the message clerk of the
House of Representatives appeared in the
main entrance of the Senate with a
package of the bills and resolutions 'n
hand. Almost Immediately Vice-Presi- j
dent H'lbart, Interrupting the debate,
recognized the clerk. He presented to
the Senate several bills and resolutions
which had been passed by the House,
Including that relating to the interven
tion of the United States In the Cuban
rebellion.
The last was the resolution adopted by
the Senate on Saturday night and agreed
to to-day by the House, with certain
amendments. Scores of members of the
House were on the lloor awaiting the ac
tion of the Senate upon tile House
amendments, and although every Sena
tor at the Capitol was present ('handler
of New Hampshire noted the absence of
a quorum and demanded a call of the
roll.
The rollcall Indicated the presence of
seventy-five Senators. Davis, the distin
guished chairman of the Foreign Rela
tions Committee, requested that the mes-
F>age from the House concerning the !
Cuban resolution be laid before the Sen- i
ate. After the reading of the message
Davis addressed the Senate. The still
ness as he began to speak was profound.
He spoke clearly, but rapidly.
"In my great anxiety to secure speedy
action upon this question," he said, "ac- i
tion which I think ought to *be taken im
mediately, i have refrained from taking
part in the discussion up to this time.
The resolutions as they come to us, with
the exceptions which I shall note, prac
tically are thr> same as those which were
reported to the Senate by the Foreign
Relations Committee."
The exceptions noted by Davis were the
striking out of the words "and are" and
the provision in the Senate resolution pro
viding for the recognition of the present |
Cuban republic. Davis then said that the
whole subject had been tnoroughly de
bated. Meantime while the debate was
proceeding, the destruction of the Maine

WASHINGTON, April 18.â In
the Senate to-day Mason of Illi

to the Naval Affairs Committee
the following concurrent resolu
tion:
"That the Senate of the Uni

resolution and that the President of the
Senate appoint its conferees.
"Let the motion be divided," cried Dan
iel.
From the Democratic side of the cham
ber came- such expressions as "We ilon't
want a conference; let's settle this ques
tion right now. while we are at it, ' etc.
Hale of Maine said that he had never [
known in long experience in the Senate, |
when the two houses were at odds, a .
committee of conference to be refused.
Conferees were appointed in order that
the differences between the two Houses
might be dissolved and an agreement
reached satisfactory to both without in
flammatory speeches on the lioor of
1 either branch.
Eie maintained that it was the duty of
the Senate to appoint conferees to assem
mn conclave in an endeavor to.
adjust the diffi â¡ the two
lies of Congress. After briefly dls
â¢ ntary status of the
resolutions Hale said that there was an
etermination here in the Senate
upon the part of the temporary majority
to dragoon everybody Into its way of
thinking. The proposition for a confer- j
was to be voted ii..wn, he declared,
and those in temporary majority who

would have to take tin- responsibility for
any delay that might now occur. He be

Aldrich of Rhode Island, briefly ad
dressing tho Senate, snld he had never
known during his service in the s< i I
such a course as was proposed by the
majority to be insisted upon, and he !
thought the Senators in favor of that
ci urse ought to give some reason for the
position they had taken. It was per
fectly evident, Aklrieh said, that the ma- [
jority desired no action at all.
In reply Jones of Arkansas maintained :
that it was the part of the House to re
quest that a conference committee be ap
pointed, and thus far the House had not
asked for a conference.
The second part of Davis' motion, direct
ing th.- Vice-President to appoint the con
e, was thi n defeated.
The consideration of the sundry civil
bill was then resumed, Galllnger's amend
ment relating to the use of the steam
: es in the Bureau of Engraving and
Printing being agreed to.
During the consideration of the sundry
civil appropriation bill Allen took the |

Allen asked for a division on the ques- i

There was some discussion about the

voice of the American Congress in favor
of Cuban freedom and Independence
should reach the Cortes. This gentleman
(Turpie) is the,, author of the clause for
which the Senate has pronounced by its
two votes with a majority of h. The
Senator from Ohio (Foraker) was the only
Republican on the Foreign Relations
Committee who advocated that clause
and now it is gravely proposed that a
conference committee shall be appointed
on which neither of these Senators shall
be â a committee of three Senators, every
nni; rf whom is against the proposition
f.r which the Senate has twice voted.
"It seems to me that the enemies of
Cuban freedom who have taken charge
of the movement, and who do not mean
that it shall co forward except under
their authorship, yes, and witn their con
sent, ought at least to allow the decision
of the matter to be In the hands of its
friends."
Chandler Bald that in the interest of I
immediate action Republican Senators !
who bad voted for the freedom of Cuba
were willing to make some sacrifices. This
was the first note sounded on the floor
of the Intention of ten Republicans to
yield their position.
Foraker of Ohio said: "I want to say,
Mr. President, In answer to the sugges- ;
tion that has been made to me as one of j
the conferees on the part of the Senate, i
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APKIL 19, 1898.
that I would be perfectly satisfied to have
the chairman name the committee, and
indeed, I should greatly prefer that hÂ«
sh( uld do so. 1 want some action to be
taken; I will not speak longer at this
time, because I have some anxiety to hear
the guns."
Frye of Maine said: "I am against tne
present recognition of the alleged repub
lic of Cuba. I believe that such recog
nition belongs to the President of the
United States and not to Congress, end
I believe that In my place some Senator
on the Foreign Relations Committee
ought to be appointed who holds views
diametrically opposite to me. The Sena
tor from Ohio (Foraker) Is the father of
this proposition to recognize the Cuban
republic now, and I trust that the V'ico-
President will appoint him. I have been
silent all through this discussion be
cause I wanted action, now for God's
pake let us do something to relieve tho.se
pi or people in Cuba. Every American
Consul and every American citizen has
loft the island. The Red Cross ha.s been
removed and come north. Every hour
is freighted with the death of womc/i and
children, and we should not delay our
action a minute. I believe that if we act I
now. within ten days Cuba will be free, I
provisions will be there for the starving
and it" not, our guns will be thundering !
at Morro Castle/
Lindsay of Kentucky made a strong !
plea for the recognition of the independ
ence of the island republic.
The first note of compromise was then j
sounded by Teller. He said it was ap- !
parent that if a vote were taken now
the Senate would change the position it ;
n â¢ k last Saturday night, and he sug
gested that the Senate might as well j
Bettl< the matter at once.
Foraker suggested that the whole ques
tion could be disposed of before adjourn
ment to-niÃht if the conferees on the part
of the Senate were appointed at once. He
had received assurances that there would
be no great difficulty in reaching a sat-
Isactory conclusion.
Teller said that at a later day he pro- |
posed to answer some of the offensive '
Utterances of the Senator from Maine
(Hale) and other supporters of the ad- i
ministration, He concluded with the ;
statement tr.-n if Spain did not answer
our ultimatums fairly then we should
speak with shotted guns.
Tillman, addressing Spooner of Wiscon
sin by name, demanded to know if he
could pivc him assurance that the admin
tion would not saddle the Spanish i
bonds upon the Cubans.
The question, put in a direct manner, i
aroused the Wisconsin Senator. He arose
from his seat on the opposite side of the
chamber, and. walking over to within a
few feet of TiHman, said: "I challenge
the decency of the Senator from Smith
Carolina in putting such an interroga
tory to me by name. I want to say now,
that the suggestion to he sent out from
here in Buch an exigency as now con
fronts this country in little less than a
slander upon the President of the United
I."
"1 am pretty thick skinned. Mr. Presi- :
dent." replied Tillman. "If I can accom
plish my purpose In preventing the possi
bility of f:*st< ninÂ« this debt upon those
people I shall be satisfied to take all the 1
odium that may attach to it."
Allen then withdrew his motion, and
the motion made by Davis that the Vice-
President should appoint tn>- conferees 1
was agreed to without division.
The Vice-President appointed as con
ferees <>n the part of mo Senate Davis,
Foraker and Morpan. The Senate then
tÂ«',.k a r ss until Rp. m. The long
waited-for situation, the return of the
rees, came at 8:10 o'clock. There
was n visible stir in the galleries as the
chairman of th c i ference committee,
Davis, rose to present tne report.
By this time nearly every Senator was
in his seat. Davis said that he had to
report that after full and free discussion
the conferees had failed to reach an â 
agreement. There was intense silence.
It was the unexpected that had happened.
Davis then stated the points of disa^ree
ment, that there had been no difficulty
to agree to the House resolution as
amended, but the point of contention
arose over the insertion of the words
"and are," in the first section, which
says the people of Cuba "are and of ripht
oucht to be free and independent." He
said that the majority of the conferee*
had agreed to report the Turple amend
ment, providing that the words above
mentioned be inserted. But the Senate
conferees wire met with refusal to so
agree and he reluctantly reported the
same to the Senate.
Morgan Btated that the chairman of the
Foreign Relations Committee spoke for
the majority. For one, he had not re
linquished the hone that the Cubans
might be free, but thought that under
the temper of the House there was little
or no use to sÂ«'inl the conferees again
into conference unless it was Indicated
that the House would recede.
Hoar of Massachusetts said it was the
understanding that if th'> United States
wrr.t to war and s<-nt its ships Into Cuban
\ aters and Its armies into Cuban terrl
tory. our navy surely would be under the
direction of the Cuban Government If the
Senate insisted upon the Turpie amend-
Maxon of Illinois Btated what he con
ceived to be the parliamentary statua of
the pending question. He Bald thai the
hope had been that if the Senate would
yield the substance of Independence th.-
Bhadow of the freedom would be left to
us.
A strong appeal was then entered hv
"White of California for action of some
kind that would end the suspense and end
it at once.
The- first part of Davis 1 motion, that to
insist upon the Senate amendments, was
carried without division. The second
I>art. that requesting a further confere
nce, was disagreed to, zu â io.
At fÂ» : IT> p. rr... on motion of Allison, a re
cess of one hour was taken.
After the recess Morgan presented a
joint resolution declaring war against
Spain, which was read and allowed to lie
on the table-.
At 10:25 Chief Clerk Browning of the
House presented a message from that
body, asking tor a further conference on
the <'Ã¼ban question.
Davis moved to Insist upon the Senate
amendment and grant a conference but
Allen asked for a division of the ques
tion. The motion to agree to a confer
ence was adopted before the second por
tion of the motion.
Allen then addressed the Senate. HÂ».
paid that tho time had com,, when the
Senate should appoint tho conferees and
not the chair.
Allen's motion to have the Senate to
name the conferees was losl, 2S â 49.
Davis' motion was carried and the Pres
ident pro tern. (Senator Frye) appointed
Senators Davis, Foraker and Morgan.
A recess was taken for half an hour.
After midnight the Senate was in for
mal recess, althouob technically in ses
slon. The conference committee remain

returned from a consultation with l.*"use

WHIT THIS
ACTION MEANS
Armed Forces to Expel
Spaniards From the
Island.
Now the Resolution as Passed
by Congress Goes to the
President.
An Agreement Reached After One of
the Hardest Fought Battles of
Recent Years.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, April 19.
After one of the hardest fought bat
tles between the two Houses known in
many years Congress at an early hour
this morning came to an agreement up
on the most momentous question it has
dealt with In a third of a century.
The Cuban resolution was passed and
will be sent to the President this morn
ing. Its provisions moan the expulsion
of Spain from the island of Cuba by the
armed forces of the United States.
There were many rollcalls in both
Houses and each body held tena
ciously to its own resolution. The con
ferees had great difficulty in agreeing.
The first conference showed a deter
mination on the part of the House not
to yield a single point, and it was only
after long consultation with the House
leaders that they agreed to allow the
little words "are and" in the first sec
tion of the Senate resolution, which de
clare that the people of Cuba "are,
and of right ought to be free and inde
pendent."
The resolution, as finally adopted,
was that reported from the Senate
Committee on Foreign Relations, with
the addition of the fourth section,
known as the Teller amendment, dis
claiming any intention on the' part
of the United States to acquire Cuba.
The resolution cannot be sent to the
President until after it is signed by
the presiding officers to-day.
The resolution as agreed to Is as fol
lows:
Joint resolution for the recognition of
the Independence of the people of Cuba,
demanding that the Government of Sp;iln
relinquish its authority and government
In the island of Cuba and to withdraw
its hind and naval forces from Cuba and
Cuban waters, and directing the Presi
dent of the United States to use the land
and naval forces of the United States to
carry these resolutions Into effect.
Whereas, The abhorrent conditions
which have existed for more than three
ye, i is In the Island of Cuba, so near our
own borders, hay.> shocked the moral
senses of the people of the United States,
have been a disgrace to Christian civ
ilization, culminating as they have in the
destruction of a United States battleship
and 266 of its officers and crew, while on
a friendly visit in the harbor of Havana,
and cannot longer be endured, as has
been set forth by the President of the
United States in his message to Con
gress of April 11, IS9S, upon which the
a< tion of Congress was invited; there
fore
Resolved, By the Senate and House of
Representatives of the United States of
America in Congresa assembled:
Firstâ Thai the people of the island of 1
Cuba are and of right ougrht to be free
and Indi pendent.
Secondâ That it is the duty of the Unit
ed St.it. s t.> demand, and tho Government
of the l':iitoi! States does hereby demand,
thai the Government of Spain at oi cc i"' v
linquish its authority and government !â¢'
tho island of <'ul>a and withdraw its lanTl
and naval forces from Cuba and Cuban
waters.
Thlrd-That the President of the United
be and he hereby is directed and
empowered to use the entire land and
naval forces of the United States, and to
call Into actual service of the United
States the militia of the several States to
tin- extent as may be necessary to carry |
this resolution into effect. .
Fourthâ That the United States hereby
disclaims any disposition or intention to
exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction or con
trol over said island except for the pact- :
fication thereof, and asserts Its determin
ation when this Is acomplished to leave
the Kovernment and control of the island
to its people.
The President retired before mid
night and the White House was desert
ed, except for the executive clerk, Mr.
Montgomery, who received the bulle
tin announcing the Senate's action over
the Capitol wire. The message was
turned over to the domestic end of the
mansion, and without waiting for the
action of the House, the executive of
fice was closed for the night.
ARMED WITH RIFLES
USED IN THE REBELLION.
National Guard of California Seri
ously Handicapped by the War
Department.
SACRAMENTO. April 18.â In Febru
ary, 1597, Congress passed a resolution
providing for an exchange of arms by
the various States and Territories which
! were then provided with old-fa-shioned
rifles. Adjutant General Barrett im
mediately sent to the War Department
I a requisition for 2300 45-caliber new
Springfield rifles in exchange for the
same number of what is known as
seventy-threes.
The reply from the^ War Department
rejected the proposed change and one
of the grounds of objection was based
on the terms of the resolution, which
the department claimed did not include
the new Springfield 4fj-caliber. The re
sult has been that in the present crisis
the State troops are provided with over
1700 old-fashioned and inferior rifles.
According to the last report of the ad
jutant general there are but 1800
Springfield 4f>-caliber rifles, when as a
matter of necessity there should be
3000 or more.
For over a year the adjutant general
has used every effort to effect the
change, but notwithstanding the com
bined endeavors of the entire Congres
sional delegation the War Department
has persistently refused to conform to
the expressed desire of Congress.
Powers Taking No Action.
LONDON, April 19.â The Berlin cor
respondent of the Times says: In well
informed quarters all reports of fresh
efforts on the part of the powers to
avert war are described as unfounded.
If President McKinley to-day
signs the resolutions adopted by Con
gress, the fact will not only be an
nounced on all The Call bulletin
boards, but will be signaled by hoist
ing the national flag in the place of
The Call flag on the Claus Spreckels
building. If the signature is not
given until to-night, it will be sig
naled by a display of red fire from
the lantern for an hour. Watch for
the signals.
HOW THE HOUSE
FINALLY DECIDES
Many Recesses, Warlike Addresses and
Songs While the Conferees Are
Reaching an Agreement.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, April 18.
For nearly seventeen hours to-day
the House of Representatives remained !
in session while the conferees were \
battling to secure an agreement on !
the wording of the resolution authoriz- ;
i<|g the President to use the army and j
navy of the United States in putting
an end to the war in Cuba, and driving
the Spaniards from that blood-stained
"gem of the Antilles."
The House, after one of the hardest
and most desperate fights in its his
tory, succeeded in forcing the Senate
to yield the main contention in the war
resolution â the Independence of the ex
isting Government of Cuba. With that
exception the House accepted the Sen
ate resolutions. The Republicans who
joined with the Democrats in an at
tempt to concur in the Senate amend
ments entire rallied fourteen votes at
one time and on every vote thereafter
the vote dwindled. When the final
vote was taken, shortly before 3 o'clock
this morning, 310 votes were cast for
the declaration upon which we .are go
ing to war, if war is to be. Six votes
only were cast against it. They in
cluded five Republicans and one Dem
ocrat.
Immediately upon the House convening
at 10 o'clock this morning. In accordance
with the recess taken Saturday morning,
Dingley, the Republican floor leader,
moved an adjournment, which motion
was carried. The regular session therefore
began at noon.
As the hands of the clock pointed to
noon the Speaker ascended the rostrum
and with one resounding whack of his
gavel silenced the confusion on the floor
and the hum of conversation in the
crowded galleries. It was an impressive
scene as the members listened with bowed
heads to the solemn invocation of the
blind chaplain.
No sooner had the chaplain ceased,
however, than the confusion was re
doubled as the members labored during
the last few precious moments. The
reading of the journal had not been con
cluded before the clerk of the Senate an
nounced the calling tip of the Cuban reso
lutions with the Senate amendments. In
stantly the gallleries were all attention,
and membe-s leaned forward in their
seats. The leaders watched each other
with alert features.
The first move was important, and as
the resolutions were read the declaration
with, regard to the recognition of the in
(!( pendence of Cuba was vociferously
cheered by the Democrats. This demon
stration was repeated when the reading
was completed.
Both Dingley, leader of the Republicans,
and Bailey were on their feet. Dingley
was recognized, and he immediately
moved concurrence in the Senate amend
ment with an amendment striking out tho
clause in the first resolution, which recog
nized the independence of the existing
republic. The actual form of the motion
(which was reduced to writing) was as
folows:
"I move to concur in tho Senate amend
ment to the Hows.' joint resolution with
an amendment striking out in the first
p.anipniph the 'are 1 and also the words,
'and that the Government of the United
States hereby recognizes the republic of
Cuba as the true and lawful government
of that island." so thnt the first paragraph
of tho Senate amendment will read as
fallows: 'First, that the people of tho
island of Cuba of right ought to be free
and Independent.' "
Upon this motion Dlngloy demanded the
previous question, which served to cut off
amendment and debate.
Bailey, who was immediately on his
foot, asked if the motion to concur with
an amendment precluded a motion to sim
ply concur, and was Informed by the
Speaker that It would not If the motion
was voted down. It was a moment of in
tense excitement.
Johnson (R.) of Indiana and Bromwell
of Ohio Were On their feet, both demand
ing recognition to state preliminary in
quiries. The former wanted to ask unan
imous consent to a. dress the House in
antagonism of the motion, but he was
howled down. But when Bromwell. a mo
ment later, declared that he wished to of
fer an amendment to concur the Demo
cratic side sent up cheer upon cheer.
The announcement pave the vote as 179
to 15fi. and the decisive victory was loudly
applauded by the Republicans. The fol

Them was a hot tilt between the
Speaker and Bailey after the vote, ending
in the latter denouncing a statement of
the Speaker "as absolutely false.'
After it became noised about on the
House side that the Senate had non-con- ;
curred with a request for a conference
the leaders held hasty consultations and
the galk-ries tilled rapidly.
At 3:40 p. m. the resolutions were re- I
turned to the House with the Senate's de
cision to non-concur. Dingley, Bailey I
and Bromwell (R.) of Ohio were all on |
their feet asking for recognition. The
Speaker recognized Dingley, who moved
that the House insist upon its amend- |
ment and ask for a conference. Upon his !
motion he demanded the previous ques- â¢
tion. Bailey, as a parliamentary- in
quiry, desired to know of the chair
whether a motion to recede and concur
would not take precedence.
The Speaker said he thought not.
Bailey cited a precedent from the
Twenty-ninth Congress, which, he said. ',
covered the exact case In point.
The Speaker asked to see it. The mem
bers waited with breathless interest
while the Speaker examined it. When he
decided that it would hold the Democrats i
applauded. The Speaker then recognized
Bromwell, who formally made the mo
tion to recede and concur. This time the
Democrats cheered and the galleries
Joined in the demonstration. As the pre
vious question cut oft" debate, the Speaker
ordered the roll called.
The vote came so unexpectedly that
the leaders of the respective sides sent
messengers and officials scurrying in all
directions to drive in absentees. Carri
ages were sent clattering to the down
town hotels at a gallop, and committee
rooms, restaurants and every place i
where a stray Congressman might be
routed out by the pages and employes of
the House. It was like a call to arms.
The responses on the rollcall were fol
lowed closely for further defections from
the Republican side, but there were no
acquisitions. In fact, two of the Repub
licans who voted against the motion to
concur with an amendment on the last
vote, Johnston of Indiana and Loud of
California, voted with the Republicans.
They did not, however, properly belong
to the deflections on the other vote, as
they voted as they did because they op
pose any action whatever. The an
nouncement of the defeat of the motion,
14S to 173, was the signal for another
demonstration on the Republican side.
The following twelve Republicans voted
for the motion to concur: Belknap, Lori
mer, Mann, Warner and White of Illin
ois, Bromwell and Brown of Ohio, Colson
of Kentucky, Cooper of Wisconsin. Dorr
r>f West Virginia, Johnson of North Da
kota and Sulloway of New Hampshire.
Dingley's motion to insist and ask for
a conference was then agreed to with
out division, the opposition realizing the
manifest uselessness of demanding a roll
call.
Just before 5 o'clock the Speaker an
nounced J,ho appointment of Adams (R. )
of Pennsylvania. Heatwole (R.) of Min
nesota and Dinsmore (D.) of Arkansas
as conferees on the Cuban resolutions.
Grosvenor then moved to adjourn, but
Cannon called attention to the fact that
the House would have to await the ac
tion of the Senate before the resolutions
would be legally in conference. There
upon Grosvenor withdrew the motion and
upon Cannon's motion the House recessed
for twenty minutes.
At 6:35 ;i further recess of twenty-five
minutes was taken. At 6 o'clock the
House tot ; a recess until 8 o'clock.
Adams had a long conference with the
Speaker at his desk. Half a dozen load
ers crowded about and took part in the
consultation. A question arose as to
whether the House, having asked for the
conference, was entitled to have charge
of the papers or not. and to settle this
question Captain McKee, the journal
clerk, paid a visit to the other end of the
Capitol.
While the House was waiting, a half
hundred of tho Representatives gathered
in the lobby of the hall and awoke the
. hoea with patriotic songs. The battle
hymn of the republic was sung by Gen
eral Henderson of (owa.
The House reconvened at 8 oclock. The
members vere jubilant over the news
which floated about that the conferees
had agreed, the Senate to yield on the
independence clause and the House agree
ing to restore the words "are and" in the
first section, but suddenly the greatest
confusion arose, when it was discovered
that there was still a hitch over the
words "are and." the two Republicans of
tin- House conferees, Adams and Heat
wole, having refused to yield on the point.
Several of the members of the Hoii*o
were in their dress suits, and In the gal
leries were many brilliant evening cos
tumes. Nothing was done until S :4o p. m.,
when the clerk of the Senate announced
the disagreement of the Senate to the
House amendment and the appointment
of conferees.
"Dixie" and other songs were sung-, led
by some ex-Confederates, and then, in
tremendous volume, tho corridors rang
with an improvisation, "Hang General
Weyler on a. Sour Apple Tree, as We Go
Marching On." The war spirit was re
flected in the songs. Soldiers bivouacking
about the camp lires In the enemy's front
could not have been more Enthusiastic
than were many of the grizzled veterans
who participated. The Btruggle which was
going on was one to si-cure parliament
ary advantage. The House, which had
possession of the conference papers, could
at any time recede and agree. It was
this desire to hold the papers which in
duced the Senate to refuse, thus com
pelling the House to further Insist and
ask for a further conference. Agreement
to this conference would give the Senate
possession of the papers.
A general conference of the leaders was
held at the Speaker's desk after the Sen
ate had voted. 39 to 40, to insist. Dalzeil
and most of the Speaker's lieutenants fav
oring: voting to further Insist, but GrOS
vi nor counseled an adjournment. He ar
gued that If the House adjourned the
country would place the responsibility for
the deadlock u:>on the Senate. There
were many indignant comments on the
situation, which placed it in the power
of one Senator to hold up the resolutions
and prevent an agreement.
At 9:35 p. m. the House was officially
notified of the Senates action in further
insisting. The Democrats applauded the
announcement. Adams (R.) of Pennsyl
vania, as soon as the report of disagree
ment had been read, moved that the
House still further insist upon its amend
ment and request a further conference.
Again Bromwei) moved that the House
recede from its disagreement and concur
in the Senate's amendments.
The Republicans who were voting with
the opposition lost the vote of Cooper of
Wisconsin on the roll call. He voted no
with the administration Republicans. The
other eleven Republicans again voted to
recede and concur.
The motion was again lost, 14-1 â 178.
Secretary of "War Alger, who entered
the hall araycd in a dress suit, while the
vote was being recapitulated, joined in
the Republican demonstration of approval
when the result was announced. Adams'
motion was then agreed to without divi
sion.
The Speaker again appointed Adams,
Heatwole and Dinamore conferees.
Adams moved a recess until 11 o'clock.
Johnson (R.) of Indian i antagonized
this with a motion to adjourn, but the
chorus of noes was so fierce that he with
drew it, and Adams' motion was agreed
to.
At 11 o'clock the House took another
recess until 11:30 p. m. to give the con
ferees another opportunity to meÂ«t. At
11:30 p. m. the House was formally noti
fied of the action of the Senate and an
other recess until 12 o'clock was taken
immediately.
At midnight the House took a recess
until 12:30 a. m. to await the action of the
conferees.
At 12:05 the House conferees asked to
be allowed to have a conference at 1
o'clock and there was then a prospect
of reaching a compromise on the original
basis.
At 12:30 the House took another recess
until 1 a. m. During this recess thÂ«
members again congregated in the lobby
in the rear of the hall and, led by sev
eral of the younger members, sang many
of the popular songs of the day.
In the House, as soon as the conferenca
report had been presented. Adams moved>
the adoption of the report, and upon >hat
motion he demanded the previous auesÂ«
tion.
The galleries gave cheer after cheer at
the resolutions were read. The demand
for the previous question cut off debate,
and Bailey and Johnson appealed for a
few minutes.
Adams refused to yield time for debate,
owing to the lateness of the hour.
Johnson protested indignantly. Bailey
demanded the ayes and noes, and the roll
was called.
The previous question waa ordered;
171â121.
The first rollcall on the adoption of the
resolution showed 293 ayes and 5 noes.
The conference report waa adopted by
the Houseâ 3lo to G. [Great applause.]
The following voted against the adop
tion of the report: Boutelle (R.) of Maine,
Brewer (D.> of Alabama. Gardner (R.) of
New Jersey. Johnson (R.) of-* Indiana,

of Massachusetts.
RIOTS OCCUR
IN PORTO RICO
American and British In
terests Are in Grave
Danger.
Protection of Foreigners on the
Island Wholly Inade
quate.
Epecial Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. April 18.â St. Thomas
(West Indies) cable advices just re
ceived from Porto Rico are to the ef
fect that rioting has occurred on the
island and that further disorders are
possible. A general revolt may re
sult. American and British interests
on the Island are In grave danger and
the remaining citizens of the United
States and British colony are greatly
alarmed. This fear was primarily
aroused by the uprising of laborers on
April 13 on the Canovanas estate of
the Colonial Company, which is spread
ing rapidly.
Large bodies of men have been mak
ing threatening demonstrations. The
protection of foreigners is inadequate
and the use of torches and wholesale
bloodshed are Imminent. The high
price of food and the failure of auton
omy are causing social and political
discontent and the colored natives are
assuming an aggressive tone. They
beat an officer on a street of the city
yesterday. International disorders are
certain. Many have been arrested aa
suspected leaders of the Insurrection
and Spanish officers have warned
friendly foreigners. The British Con
sul Is ill and on a leave of absence, and
the Vice-Consul, a Creole of Spanish
sympathy, is in his place. He is en
gaged in business, which takes most of
his time.
American and British interests are
unsafe, and the colonists want Great
Britain to send warships there to pro
tect them. Convict labor Is being
used night and day on fortifications.
Large shipments of dynamite, mines,
thousands of rifles and millions of cart
ridges have arrived there. Two bat
talions from Havana arrived on April
15. The men were in a pitiful condi
tion. In San Juan harbor now aro
the warships Concha, the Ponce de
Leon, the Alfonso XII, the Isabella V
and the Crillo. Ten thousand tons of
coal are stored there and more Is com
ing. Eighty thousand rations have
been ordered from Spain. The warship
Bausan Is going to Havana to-day.

DEADLOCK IN
THE CASE OF
THE FINIGANS
Settlement of the Famous San
Rafael Divorce Suit Not
Yet in Sight.
Wife of the "Affluent Pauper" Unable to Pro
ceed Until He Is Made to Ad
vance Money to Defray
the Costs.
PAX RAFAEL, April 19.â There Is a
deadlock in the case of Finigaa versus
Finigan. To-day in the Superior Court
at San Rafael Ji:<lj, â¢ Angellotl denied
Colonel Finigan's moti"ii to set a date
for the trial of the f.m-.ous divorce
case, which was begun a year and a
half ago.
"It is a genera] rule, especially in
courts of equity," is the argument of
Mrs. Finigan'a counsel," that a party
In contempt will not be heard to ask
any favor of the co-urt in the case In
which the contempt occurs, nor be per
mitted to take any affirmative step in
the particular litigation, except only
such as is necessary to his defense
against the charge of contempt until
be has purged himself of such charge."
"The hearing of the defendant," says
Colonel Finigan's attorney, "resulted In
his discharge and trf the order to show
cause, which necessarily purged him of.
the contempt. Otherwise we should
have th<- absurd position that the party
had dune nothing for which he could be
punished, yet was still guilty of con
tempt."
P. 11. Lund appeared for the always
in-contempt colonel and Attorney
Crowley for Mis. Finigan.
Colonel Finigan's enemies say that he
is 70 years old. His friends admit that
Ij.' is 60. And he looks about 55. His
is round and ruddy, his mustache
is quite white, and his small light eyes
look out amiably upon the world from
. -neath his bushy white eyebrows.
.!!â¢â  sat m ...int to-day, really a very
well-dressed pauper. In his button
hole was one of these beautiful San
Rafael roses, which are already riot
ingâin anticipation of the carnival â
over the very peaks of the houses and
to the topmost branches of the trees.
His year and a hi.lf of litigation has
been of some Bervice to him, despite
the claim of his friends that it has
ruined his credit, for it has taught the
colonel how to maintain his composure
under trying circumstances.
"The plaintiff is unable to pay the
- <>l this action. She is unable to
pay her counsel. If it were not for
her relative :- -!: â  would lack the neces-
Baries of life," declared Attorney Crow
ley, in combating the motion to-day.
"She is unable to pay a five-cent piece
toward this litigation, and this defend
ant appears, surrounded by counsel,
dressed in the height of fashion, with
that audacity which has characterized
his proceedings in this case, while
calmly permitting his wife to depend
on charity of relatives, and asks the
court to set a date for the trialâ a trial
which the plaintiff is positively unable
â¢ on with for lack of funds it is the
defendant's duty to provide. It is the
height of impudence."
And the genial Hibernian, falsetto
voiced Colonel Finigan â pauper or
quarter-millionaire, according to your
bias in the matterâ who had put on his
gold-rimmed pince-nez, sat two feet
away, apparently absorbed in a news
paper, shifting his position occasion
ally or twisting a silver pencil-holder
uneasily, but on the whole bearing
the attack with equanimity.
"We do not press the case for to-day
or to-morrow," argued Attorney Lund.
"We don't want to take Â»nap judgment
â¢upon the plaintiff, who is entitled to
consideration. We -would not ask that
the trial be set for this month. If, in
the meantime," he concluded gener
ously, "we get our hands on any
money, we'll help her."
Strange to relate, the attorney for
handsome Mrs. Finigan didn't appear
to consider that this settled all the pe
cuniary difficulties of the case. When
plaintiff's counsel pleaded poverty, de
fendant's attorney vied with him in the
pitiful presentation of poor Colonel
Finigan's sad case. When Crowley
talked about that property signed over
by Colonel Finigan to his lawyers
pince the filing of the suit for divorce
Lund said he "might talk about $500
checks, but he wouldn't. It was unnec
essary. But," he asked, "when would
plaintiff be in a better position?"
The answer to this, of course, is that
plaintiff will be in a better financial
position when defendant's finances im
prove. Defendant's finances will im
prove when this vexatious divorce suit
js settled, which will be when plaintiff's
financial position is bettered. This is
the Finigan endless chain. There is no
patent upon it. Any married couple,
consisting of an old, wealthy, obstinate
husband and a young, fine-looking, re
sentful wife, unable to compromise
their differences, may take advantage
of the formula and get their domestic
affairs quite as hopelessly tangled.
The last motion of Colonel Finigan
presents another old phase of this pe
culiar caseâ the defendant pleading for
and the plaintiff objecting to the trial
of a divorce suit, which, though a year
and a half old, has never made its ap
pearance in public, except in the shape
of alimony and counsel fee fights, im
prisonments for contempt of court and
other light preliminary legal skir
mishes.
It's an indication, plaintiff's attor
neys say, that Colonel Finigan is weary
of the strained position his own ob
stinacy begets: that he has an invest
ment for the funds so carefully hidden,
and that he Is anxious to see the end
of the endless chain. It's simply, say
defendant's attorneys, for the purpose
of showing that plaintiff has no case
or phe'd be eager to have it tried:
though Colonel Finigan is getting to
be an old man, and he is anxious to
be able to work for some provision for
his children.
What the next move in this case wll
be nobody is willing to prophesy. Jt
may be a motion to dismiss the suit
firm the defendant. It may be a fur
thci demand for money or for liberty
fiom the plaintiff, should new or over
looked evidence of Colonel Finigan's
hidden riches he brought to light.
For that this self-confessed, repeat
edly sworn p.-iuper, who lives at the
Hotel Rafael, whoso wine card runs up
to ten or twelve dollars a day at times,
who looks and who lives like one who
loves the good things of this world, !s
other than well provided with the mu
nitions of logal war, counsel for the
plaintiff will not for - moment admit.
And Judge Angellotti himself, in dis
missing the motion, repeated to-duy
;what he had said before:
"I am satisfied in my own mind that
the defendant is not destitute of
means."
But where is Colonel Fini<?an's eso
teric Klondike? Attorneys have sought
in vain, though encouraged by the ad
vice of the court, by the necessities
of the situation, by the inspiring
thought that to compel a man to pay
his wife's counsel fees is the sweetest
kind of revenge; a combination of in
sult and injury beside which the old
school teacher's sendine the bad boy
down to the river to cut willow switches
f'>r his own chastisement sinks into in
significance.
Unless the good fairy of compromise
comes to cut this matrimonial Gordian
knotâ and the very vigor with which
this solution is scouted makes one hÂ«. pe
for its ultimate adoptionâ a new cen
tury will be born, whose round, as
tonished eyes will behold the quasi im
prisonment for various terms of con
tumacious Colonel Finfgan, by a liberal
minded jailer, the never-ending pleas
i p , overt >'- and perpetual motion
solved by the conjugal jangling of the
i-inigan endless chain. That is if Col
onel Flnigan and Mrs. Finigan's just
wrath endure that long.
In the meantime defendant 1* serene
and very comfortable at the Hotel
Rafael. There he and his daughters
live, while a son of 15 has all the ad
vantages, educational an] otherwise
that the son of a pauper who used to
be worth a quarter of a million should
have, on the hotel books the queerest
items are charged up to Colonel Fini
gan's ever-increasing account, if Miss
Finigan or either of her younger sis
ters require drugs or clothes or books,
these things are paid for by the hotel
management and charged up. There
are little items such as "Cash, $1 50"
"Cash, $5"; "Cash, $10"; which betray
to the world that exceedingly charita
ble spirit which animates the soul of
this marvel of hotel keepers, whose
trust in poverty-stricken Colonel Fini
gan is bo complete that besides board
bills and rent for handsome apartments
he assumes the entire burden of min
istering to the Finigan family's wants.
"They harp upon the colonel's living
at the Hotel Rafael." said a friend of
his across the bay. "They insist that it
hurts his case."
"Why doesn't he leave then?"
"Why? For the simplest reason. He ]
couldn't ' live anywhere else. A man i
like Warn" eld, who's rich, can afford to
wait for his money. A poor woman
who kept the kind of lodging-house
people would like to see Colonel Fini- !
gan live in would have to be paid
monthly. And the colonel hasn't the !
money."
Which is funny and ought to be '
recommended to all paupersâ those who
have been worth a quarter of a million
and those who haven't. If you're needy, i
if you haven't a nickel to bless your
selfâand your suing wife â with, "learn :
the lesson that the Finigan philosophy
preaches. Avoid second-class lodging
houses. You would only inflict your
misery upon those who themselves' are i
comparatively needy. Seek boldly che â 
finest, the swellest inn in all the coan- i
tryside and trust to Providence to re- j
ward your solicitude for the misfor- !
tunes of othersâ as it has Colonel Fini

you; a Warfleld who'll clothe you, shel- !

the blue-racer variety, four feet long,
rolled out of a mail pouch in the bag

NEVADA CITY, April IS.â As two
trains, closely following each other, ar
rived shortly after 5 o'clock, bringing
400 Grand Army delegates to the an
nual encampment, half the population
of the city was on hand and gave the
veterans a welcome they will never for

Of bells and band music, and in return
the veterans and sens of veterans
cheered back, and everybody was hap

more, and by noon to-morrow all the
delegates will be on hand.
The arrangements for taking care of
the crowd are perfect and everybody
here so far is comfortably situated,
â with room to spare for as many more.
To-night the city was ablaze with elec
trical displays of marked beauty. Hun
dreds of strangers thronged the streets,
many of them taking their first glimpse
of the typical mining town by night.
Around the lobbies of the hotel dele
gates discussed proposed legislation,
considered the prospects of various
candidates and canvassed the situa

unusual smoothness the past year.
The department membership has in
creased from 5405 to 5492 and 123 com

for places on the board are: John C.
Currier, W. J. Ruddick and Charles S.
Wilson, all of San Francisco. Sonoma
County will present the name of Judge
Crawford of Santa Rc-sa or A. L.
"Winans of Petaluma.

numerous, among them being the
following: For office of department
commander Colonel George Stone and
Sol Cahen, of San Francisco, W. H.
Seamans of Los Angeles, F. W. Cush
ing of Oakland, are named. For senior
vice-commander â A. C. Shafer of Los
Angeles, Allen Cooley of Marysville.
For junior vice-commander J. W. Cul
lough of Post Xo. 10 of Auburn is the

tanooga Post of this city, which has
no candidate for any office, will use its
influence to have him chosen by ac
clamation. For chaplain, J. A. Cruzan
of San Francisco, the incumbent, is out
for re-election, and Rev. A. Drahms,
chaplain at San Quentin prison, is his
opponent.
The Sons of Veterans have fourteen
camps in their division, including one
in Honolulu, which is a gain of four
for the year. The membership has in
creased by 116, making the total 418.
The old Indebtedness has been wiped
out and the money in the treasury dou
bled. Colonel Charles L. Pierce, divis
ion commander, is fighting to have the
organization establish permanent head
quarters in San Francisco and hold
meetings at a different date from the
Grand Army, so that the veterans who
are honorary members of this organiza
tion can attend the encampments. He
urges the formation of each camp into
a uniformed company, pledged and
ready at all times to respond to the call
of the country when soldiers are want
ed on the field of battle.
The Women's Relief Corps reports for
the past year will make a gratifying
Bhowing. The membership has grown
from 2959 to 3100.

ted, giving a total of sixty-seven in the
department. Nearly $5500 has been ex
pended for relief.
Two of the Grand Army delegates
here are receiving special honors on all
hands. Each wears the Congressional
medal of honor bestowed for bravery.
One is Judge Buckles and the other
Colonel Parnell. The latter is one of
the only two- survivors of Balaklava on
this coast. Colonel Trevelyan of Fres
no is the other survivor of that charge,
but is not here.
To-morrow morning all the bodies
will go into session for work. In the
evening a reception will be given them
and on Wednesday will occur the pa
rade and the visit to the mines.

BRING GOLD
FROM DAWSON
T^A^o Parties Arrive on
the Steamship Utopia
at Seattle.
Over Two Hundred Thousand
Dollars Brought Out by
Four Men-
Report the Recovery of the Bodies of
Sixty-Three Victims of the
Chilcoot Avalanche.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE. April 18.â The steamship
Utopia got into port to-night, having
on board several Klondikers. One party
of four Jeft Dawson on March 18, com
ing out over the ice and reaching tide
water eighteen days later. They are
Chris Morgan of Butte County, Cali
fornia, \V. E. Lloyd of Cripple Creek,
Colo.. M. B. Hall of Spokane, Wash.,
and P. M. Madale of Seattle.
Another returning party, most of the
members of which have claims on
Stewart and Pelly Rivers, includes J.
E. McGrew, J. S. Cole, William Boh
lander, A. Habner, John Badley and M.
Sheppard. In answer to an inquiry aa
to the amount of money his party
brought out Mr. Morgan said:
"We have over $200,000 in drafts, bul
lion and dust. We all have valuable
claims and will return in a few weeks
to work them."
Morgan started from Fort Yukon on
February 23, with Captain Phil Ray
and came with him as far as Dyea. He
says:
"There is every promise for big re
sults from the Tanana River. It is not
a swift stream and is navigable about
250 miles for small steamers. The
method of prospecting has changed on
the Yukon. Old miners never looked for
gold in the flat places without any
grade. If they had done that *a year
or two ago they would have been
thought crazy. Now they are digging
down anywhere, going to bed rock and
finding gold. It is the greatest gold
bearing country In the world, and my
own opinion is that the gold in there
is only just beginning to be found.
Why, they are taking out nuggets of it
away up on the benches and side hills.
That shows that the gold deposit is not
the result of action of streams, and
that a man is Just about as likely to
find gold away from a creek bed as in
it."
The Klondikers report that the winter
trail over the ice and snow will soon
be a thing of the past. The ice is
rapidly breaking up and the rivers are
opening.
When the last man out passed the
scene of the avalanche on Chilcoot trail
sixty-three bodies had been recovered
and the work of looking for the un
fortunates was still in progress.
CONTEST FOR SALINAS'
MAYORALTY CHAIR.
Hill Refuses to Give Way to Francee,
Whom the Court Declared
Elected.
SALINAS. April IS.â When the City
Council met this evening Mayor Hill was
about to take his seat to prpside when
Attorney Renison served upon him a copy
of Judge Doollng's decision, declaring
Charles Francee elected to the position,
and demanded that Hill vacate the chair
and allow Francee take it. It was said
that as no appeal had been filed, refusal
to comply with this demand would be
contempt. Attorney Lacey advised Hill
that, if he would be guided by- counsel, he
should continue to exercise the functions
of Mayor and ignore the demand. At this
point ex-Mayor Francee aovanced to the
rail dividing the Council from the public
and made a formal demand for the
Mayor's position, uill replied that he re
spectfully declined to accede to his re
quest. This ended the incident.
After withdrawing Francee and his ad
visers held a meeting on the street and
agreed to try quo warranto proceedings.
They hold that an appeal does not stay
proceedings. The demand was made,
though ten days are allowed after judg
ment for filing an appeal.

A Speckled Card Drew a
Light Attendance at
Ingleside.
Four of the Purses Picked Up
by Favorites in the
Ring.
Canaca Possessed of a Sharp Turn of
Specd â Caspar Unable to Get
a Mark.
A meek, humble-looking card confront
ed visitors to the Ingrleside track yester
day. It had a shopworn look, and attract
ed a most moderate-sized crowd L'be
weather was cool, and there was but one
redeeming feature to the sportâ the music.
It was the best furnished during the en
tire racing season. Outside- of the victory
of four favorites, the racing was dull and I
featureless.
Ed Corrig&n'a filly Winifred was chalked
up favorite for the opening four-furlong |
scramble for two-year-old fillies, but |
Burns & Waterhouse dropped Bonibel In,
und the piebald lilly beat the first choice
out a couple of lengths.
Miller & Blazer finally landed a purse
with San Mateo. With the more danger
d _;s 01 ea scratched, the brown colt was
installed an even-money chance for the six- i
furlong sprint following, and after leading !
all the way downed imp. Mistral over
two lengths in 1:14' 2 . Zamar ran an in
different race, finishing in the show.
H. L. Frank's English-bred horse Bitter
Root came very near furnishing a sur
prise in the mile dash for three-year-olds,
with but four facing the barrier. Torsida,
with Thorpe In the saddle, mostly en
attention 01' speculators, ruling
a 4 to 6 favorite. Piggott, astride Bitter

by finishing behind San Venado.
Twinkler was always favorite in the
ring for the mile ajid a quarter run, de
1 under Selling conditions, and with
â  son up came on from third position
when squared away for the wire, win
ning cleverly from the 50 to 1 shot. Little
Cripple. "Pop" Weaver was a close
third on his gelding Tulare.
; Hall appears to have another
shifty trick in the Crighton-Xellie Bell
lilly Canace. An pven-monoy favorite in
the betting on the tive-furlbng spin fnr
two-year-olds, she was in front the entire
r'Ute, and downed Ach in a canter in 1:02
Caspar was served up a piping hot fa
vorite for the final mile selling affair, and
gotung cut off at the turn was never
prominent. Miss Ross led to the stretch
where Lena took command and won
handily from the 40 to 1 shot, Veloz

Satyr Ftarte<l with Galen Brown's colors up
for th<? first time in the mile and a quarter
run, an.l after covering half a mile well up
near the front, bmke f^wn bidly. The bay
uld hardly hobble off the" track and
will have to fee shelved.
Arh doesn't seem to like a route. He was
sprawling all over the track at the finish.
Al Martin thinks the Judges a trifle out of
line when they ordered the entry of Lost Girl
refused some days at-o at Oakland for incon
sistent running. The mare has had a severe
Jgnlnc. an d. if the officials observed
C Â«\ y l f y must huv * sc-ti that he was cut

MEXICAN PETE IS Â£ASY.
The Man From Montana Is Evi-
dently Soft Game for Big
Jeffries.
Members of the Olympic Club who have
seen Mexican Pete epar with heavy
weight Kennedy predict a very easy vic
tory for Jeffries.
Yesterday quite a number of sports
gathered at Pete's training quarters, aa
It was privately announced that Pete
would mix matters with his trainer, and
some lively boxing would result. But the
unforeseen happened. The sports were
doomed to disappointment. Kennedy, al
though much slower than Pete, found not
the least difficulty in hitting Pete on the
neck or jaw whenever he pleased, and
Pete's return blows were so light that
Kennedy smiled each time he was hit. In
fact, the exhibition was made up princi
pally of hugging, clinching and tomfool-
erv.
Pete Is unquestionably quick on his
feet and will give Jeffries some truble to
locate him when time is called for listio.
punches. He will look a pigmy when he
stands in front of the Los Angeles cham
pion. Pete in fighting costume looks to
weigh about 165 pounds. Jeffries will have
lots of fun chasing the champion of Mon
tana, who is very quick on his pins. The
betting at Crowley & Ragett's yesterday
was $10 to $3. with Pete on the short end
and very little money In sight.
The Jefferson Athletic flub will hold its
regular monthly exhibition on Thursday
evening, April 21, at the club house.

DRAINAGE SYSTEM NEEDED.
Professor Hilgard on the Evils of

BERKELEY, April IS.â Professor E. W. |
Hilgard, dean of the College of Agricul
ture of the State University, In a lecture
this afternoon before the agricultural
seminary on "Irrigation and Drainage,"

Pigeons' Remarkable Flight.
Eight homing pigeons belonging to Jonn
Mole were liberated at Ashland, Or., Sat
urday at 5:35 a. m., and were in their loft
at p;ast Oakland at 2:18 p. m.. making
the trip in the quick time of S hours and
43 minutes, an average spoed of about
10% yards per minute. The birds were
liberated by Mis? Myrtle C. Gill of Ash
land, who telegraphed to H. F. Whitman,
the race secretary of the California Hom
ing and Pigeon Club, as follows: "Liberat
ed pigeons 5:35. Weather slightly cloudy.
Wind north." Mr. Mole Is flving'hls birds
for the long distance record of 1898, and
stands an excellent chance of winning the
$25 in gold offered uy the club to the win
ner of that record. He will now send
them to Roseburg, which is about 100
miles farther north.

CORPSE FOUND
IN A RESERVOIR.
Probable Suicide of a Middle-Aged
Man on the Balston
Estate.
EELMONT, April 18.â A queer find was
made to-day in the reservoir belonging to
the former Ralston estate, situated in the
hills behind Belmont. Mrs. Bull of Rad
cliffe Hall is the present owner of the es
tate. A man driving: some calves from
Spanishtown to Belmont this morning
noticed what he correctly supposed to be
a corpse floating on the surface of the
reservoir. On his arrival in town he noti
fied Eugene O'Neill of his discovery, and
the latter telephoned to Dr. Crow at Red
wood City, mt- Coroner of San Mateo
County. ThW doctor drove to Belmont
and with the assistance of O'Neill and
others proceeded to withdraw the corpse
from the lake.
The body was that of a middle-aged
man. wearing good clothing, but absolute
ly lacking any means of identification
No money or valuables were found on his
person.
A jury was Impaneled, and the verdict
was that the deceased had fallen into the
water Whether by accident or design
was not clearly apparent, but the opinion
of the jury Inclined to suicide. The corpse
had been in the water about ten days, and
was badly decomposed.

NEW ARMY TO
BE CREATED
Congress to Enact Legis-
lation Relating to
Volunteers.
Indefinite Increase of the Mili
tary Force of the United
States.
Move Made Nece36ary by the Pres
ent Constitutional Status of
the Militia.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW TORK, April 18.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent sends the
following: Congress will be called upon
within the next few days to enact com
prehensive legislation which will pro
vide for the indefinite increase of the
United States military forces for for
eign service. The proposed legislation
will settle the vexed question of the
power of the President to use the State
National Guard for such service, should
they volunteer, by entirely obviating
the necessity of depending upon the
State organizations as such to aid in
fighting an enemy outside the United
States.
Senator Hawley, chairman of the
Senate Committee on Military Affairs,
and Representative Hull, chairman of
the House Military Committee, will in
troduce the proposed bill probably to
morrow. The measure has been pre
pared at the War Department, and
meets the approval of Secretary Alger
and the military authorities of the de
partment.
The bill is intended to meet not only
the present emergency, but to provide
for all future emergencies. The bill,
while it seeks to provide fortheinerease
of the United States army in time of
war, does notconfllct many way with the
army organization bill recently amend
ed by the House Military Committee.
The new bill provides that the mili
tary forces of the United States shall
consist of the regular army and the
militia of the States when called into
Federal service. The term "militia"
in this connection is not intended^ to
mean National Guards, but every at>le
bodied male citizen of the United
States between the ages of IS and 45.
The army is thus defined as the regu
lar standing army, which shall exist
during peace and war, and a volunteer
army, which shall be called into ser
vice by.the President whenever Con
gress shall declare that a state of war
exists, and shall be mustered out of
service at the close of hostilities.
The volunteer army is to have the
same organization of officers, regi
ments, brigades, divisions and corps as
the regular army. It is to be speci
fically a part of the United States
army, and all of its officers are to be
commanded by the President and its
recruits to be enlist-d by the United
States recruiting officers. Every vol
unteer or recruit is to be enlisted in
dividually in the United States ser
vice and is to be amenable to no State
jurisdiction. Organizations called from
the different States may, at the discre
tion of the President, bear the name
of their State for distinctive purposes
and the Governor of the State may
recommend to the President the name's
of officers up to the rank of colonel,
who may command troops raised in his
State, but the President is not bound,
to make such selections.
No limit Is set as to the size of the
volunteer army. That Is left for Con.
press to determine, in order to meet
the contingencies that may ariso.
The necessity for the proposed bill Is
found in the provisions of the consti
tution affecting the militia, which as
such may be used only within the
limits of the United States to repress
Insurrections and repel invasions. It
can in no sense, under the constitution,
be considered part of the army of the
United States for foreign service. It
is held by the War Department author
ities that should the State militia vol
unteer as organizations to serve the
Federal Government In a war carried
into a foreign territory, they are still
State troops and cannot be bound un
der the constitution to remain in the
United States service, nor can the Fed
eral Government compel them to fight
outside the limits of their State. It is
to remove the necessity of the Federal
Government being left to depend upon
organizations over which it cannot con
stitutionally have exclusive Jurisdiction
that the proposed legislation is to be
introduced.
METEORIC SHOWER
STARTLES OREGONJANS.
Two Lurid Clouds With a Myriad of
Shooting Stars Traveling
Back and Forth.
PORTLAND, April IS.â The citizens of
Hunting-ton, on the Oregon Railway and
Navigation Company line, near the Idaho
boundary, were startled last night by the
appearance of a meteoric shower, the like
of which none of them had ever wit
nessed. Two parallel clouds strangely Il
luminated with a lurid plow stretched
across the zenith, and between them
played a fire of shooting stars that con
tinued for over four hours. The long,
narrow clouds loot ed to the excited in
habitants of Huntington like great bat
tlt-ships, and the effect produced was
sensational in the extreme. No one who
witnessed the phenomenon went to bed
at all, and to-day it is the chief topic of
conversation in the village and surround
ings.
The shower was first noticed at about
9 o'clock and continued with unabated
brilliancy until long after midnight. Com
ing at this time many who saw it attach
special significance to it and declare that
it Is prophetic of an Impending naval
conflict between a united states vessel
and one of Spain.

CLINTON TIRED
OF REFORMING
His Resolution to Restrict
the Racing Season
Defeated.
Another Postponement on the
Proposition of a Mission
Monkey Ranch.
Efforts to Put Through the Third-
Street Paving Job Have Not Yet
Been Abandoned.
Three matters of more than usual im
portance came up before the Board of
Supervisors yesterday. One of these, the
Third street paving job, involving $2100,
attracted little attention, but the other
two, relating to the racing season in this
city, and the proposed Mission monkey
ranch, caused considerable discussion.
At last week's session Mayor Phelan
vetoed the contract for "repairing" Third
street, between Mission and Howard,
which had been let to Flinn & Treacy for
$2100. His reason -was that the explana
tion made by J. J. Dowling for with
drawing his bid of $950 for the same work
was not satisfactory. The matter came
up yesterday on a motion to refer the sub
ject again to the Street Committee, which
would indicate that hope has not been
abandoned of putting the "job" through.
The motion was carried.
Clinton's racing resolution, â which was
amended by a special committee last
week so as to provide for sixty consecu
tive days' racing, exclusive of Sundays,
met with a fate that caused its author
to exclaim in tones of discouragement:
"From this moment I cease to attempt
to be a reformer."
When it was reached on the file. Smith
moved that action on it be indefinitely
postponed.
Clinton moved, as an amendment, that
it be passed to print. He argued that by
reducing the racing period in this city
from six months to six weeks, an im
portant step would be taken toward the
abatement of the poolroom evil.
Smith claimed that a State law would
be necessary to do this, as there was
nothing to prevent racing in neighbor
ing cities, for which pools would be sold
in this city. The only Undency of the
resolution, if passed, he argued, would be
to discriminate against San Francisco.
Lackmann opposed Clinton's amend
ment for the same reasons set forth by
Smith.
On roll call, Clinton and Rivers were
the only members to vote for the amend
ment. Devany, Haskins, Delany, Shee
han, Lackmann, Rottanzl, Morton, Britt
and Smith voted in the negative. Dodge
was absent.
Smith's original motion was carried
without objection, and it was at this
point that Clinton renounced the role of
reformer.
In order to provide for the continued
lighting of public buildings, the provisions
of the one-twelfth act were suspended,
bo far as they related to the public build
ing lighting fund. Mayor Phelan an
nounced that the $30,000 which was in this
fund at the beginning of the year was
already exhausted.
Clinton opened the fight on the propo
sition to give the City Attorney power to
begin condemnation suits to secure the
land for the proposed Mission Pnrk. Ho
moved that the proposition be laid over
for nine months. This received no sec
ond and Clinton, nowise discouraged,
moved that it be laid over for one month.
Lackmann came to the rescue with a sec
ond. Clinton promised that if this car
ried he would make a thorough investi
gation of the matter and would be able
tn show that the proposition involve] a
shameful waste of public money, as nine
tenths of the people in the Mission did not
want the park. The city, he added, owned
100 acres of land which could be used
for a park, if one were really wanted.
Rottanzl wanted to know what the es
timated expense would be for acquiring
the land In question.
Devany said this would be a matter for
a jury to decide, and added that the prop
erty owners were asking $Â£50,000 for their
lands.
Rottanzl moved to amend that action
be postponed for one week so as to give
him time to look into the matter of ex
pense.
Through the intercession of Devany, T.
V. O'Brien, who was credited by Clinton
with representing the owners of the lands
Involved, addressed the board in favor
of the park.
Rottanzi withdrew his amendment, and
a vote was taken on Clinton's motion to
postpone action for one month. It was
lost by the following vote: AyesâLack
mann, Rottanzi, Smith, Clinton. Total. 4.
Noesâ Devany, HasKlns, Delany, Shee
han, Morton, Brltt. Rivers. Total, 7.
Rottanzi moved to postpone for a week,
and this was carried without objection.
Delany introduced a resolution grant-
Ing permission to the Western Addition
Athletic Club to give boxing exhibitions.
This was changed so as to exclude pro
fessionals from participating and was
passed.
A similar petition from the Alpine Ath
letic Club, with headquarters at 28 Gold
en Gate avenue, was presented and re
ferred to the proper committee.
The following veto message of the
Mayor was read:
SAN FRANCISCO, April IS, IS9S
The Honorable, the Board of Supervisors nf
the City and County of San Franciscoâ Gentle
men: Herewith I return to you without my
approval a demand on the treasury by the
Edison Light and Power Company for $12S" a

have had a test made or the electric
meters in use in the City Hall and find that
out of those examined eleven are running fast
and two are running slow, and this is the rea
son for my objection. I recommend that your
Finance Committee demand a rebate on the
itemized showing, which I herewith submit
I'nder similar conditions the Palace Hotel iri
this city has demnnded and received a large
rebate. The lighting fund for public build
ings set aside at the beginning of the year, as
you are aware, has been depleted, and hence

Stands Ready to Answer the Many
Charges Mads Against Him in

Harry Corson Clarke, the much-abused

KILLING BREEDING FISHES.
A. V. La Motte Is Strongly Opposed
to the Capture of Steelheads
by Anglers.
Alfred V. La Motto, who has charge of
the fish hatchery near Ukiah Is un
questionably well versed in all piscatorial
affairs ai I his views on fish propagation
are well worthy of consideration, but Mr.
La Motte, in a communication to The
Call, is evidently not in line with the
doings of the Fish Commission, otherwise
he would possibly reprimand them for
amalgamating with local midwinter fish
ermen in the destruction of breeding
fishes.
During the winter season of 1597-1593
the Fish Commissioners, the chief of the
fish patrol, and some of the deputies en-
Joyed great sport in Russian River in.
hooking, playing and landing large steel
heads which were on a journey from the
ocean to spawning beds. Several largo
steelheads were taken and shipped to this
city.
But Mr. La Motte, in the following com
munication to The Call, is evidently of
the opinion that the Fish Commissioner!
and their deputies would not dream of
such a thing as making a bad precedent
for the local angling fraternity.
A little Inquiry may. however, alter Mr.
La Motte's ideas of the question of fish,
slaughter by means of red and line as
interpreted by the Board of Fish Com
missioners of this State. It has been fre
quently proven that where steelheads are
plentiful a single haul of a net will land
more fishes than are taken during a sea
son by local anglers.
Mr. La Motte's letter to The Call is,
however, self-explanatory:
Editor The Callâ Dear Sir: The importance
of artificial propagation of trout Is becoming
more and more apparent each year. The num
ber of fishermen is Increasing so rapidly that
nature fails to keep pace with the demand
made on her bounty. A few years since It
was estimated that there were in San Fran
cisco 5000 people who were votaries of the
sport; now it is claimed that they exceed
10,000. Now our waters do not Increase, hence
one of these things must be done more fish
must be raised for the waters we have or
fewer fishermen can indulge in their favorite
pastime. The California Fish Commission is
taxed to the utmost of its appropriation to
supply the needs of the most prominent waters,
while other localities Just as favorable are
obliged to depend altogether on the natural
product, which is entirely inadequate. It Is
true that a more law-abiding sentiment is preÂ«
vailing in many localities. At the same timÂ«
many acts of lawlessness are indulged in. Our
indigenous trout (steelheads) ascend our
streams with the winter and spring rains on
their way to their spawning beds, and large
quantities are still butchered by the spear men,
who follow them up relentlessly. Others take
advantage of the law which permits their cap
ture in tide waters, no matter how heavily
laden they may be with eggs, knowing- full
well that every ten-pound female they kill
represents some 8000 fry destroyed, yet grum
ble at the Fish Commission the following sum
mer because the fish in the streams are becom
ing decimated. They willfully destroy the
goose that lays the golden egg and howl for
more freese to destroy. The votaries of the rod
and reel condemn the spear men, and the
spear men cry out against the law which al
lows city men, as they call them, from killing
the fish in tide water, and bo it goes, "pot
calling kittle black," while both are wrong.
If our trout Is a game fish and worthy of
conservation it should be protected wherever
found during the spawning season. Other
pseudonym sportsmen will locate themselves
on the shallow rapids and with No. 4 hook*
fill baskets with fry not more than fingerlingrs,
and call it sport. Such people have not thÂ» in
stincts of sportsmen in them and should he
frowned down and their practice made odious.
Ask such people to subscribe a few dollars
toward the establishment of hatcheries, or the
protection of our game or fish, and they re
ply "Why, where Is the Fish Commission 7"
The editor of Recreation has properly named
them "fish and game hogÂ«." LA MOTTE .

fJN EVIDENT MISCONCEPTION.
GENERAL MILES' order refusing permission
for the troops at the Presidio to march through
the city on their way to the front was evidently
founded on a misconception of the situation. The
General ba?ed his refusal on the ground that such a
march would be in the nature of a spectacular parade
inappropriate to the occasion. This is clearly an er
ror, and it is to be hoped the General will reconsider
his decision before the troops move.
The initial march to war by a body of soldiers
equipped for a long campaign and in fatigue uniform
is not a spectacular performance in the ordinary
meaning' of that phrase. One might as well call the
solemn service of the church a spectacular perform
ance. There is an essential and a vital difference be
tween the sight of men going about a great and noble
duty with well-ordered discipline, and a display which
is intended as a pageant merely. A parade which is
to end with a parade is a spectacular performance,
but a march of soldiers to war at the call of patriotic
duty is a very different thing and has a profoundly
different effect upon the minds of the beholders.
The patriotism of the people so keenly excited at
this time has awakened in every breast an ardent de
sire to manifest the loyalty which all feel for the flag
of the republic and the army and navy, which uphold
it in battle. It was this feeling that prompted the peo
pie to make General Lee's return a continuous ova
tion from Tampa to Washington. It was because he
stood as a representative of the nation in its attitude
toward Spain that thousands greeted him with cheers
at every station along its route. He showed himself
to the people and received the cheers as of right he
should. Does any sane man in America consider that
in doing this General Lee made himself a spectacular
show?
The desire of the people of San Francisco to see the
troops start on their march to the front is one of
honest patriotism, and not of idle curiosity. Arrange
ments had been made to permit the children of the
public schools to witness the march that it might serve
them as a memorable object lesson and instill into
them new conceptions of the honor that comes to
those who uphold the glory of the flag. It would
have entered into no man's mind that the occasion
was one of spectacular parade, and, had such a sug
gestion come from any one of less dignity than the
commanding general of the army, it would have
been hooted down with indignation.
THE TELELECTROSCOPE.
1 \EPORTS from Europe are to the effect that the
Iâ/ greatest marvel of the Paris exposition in iooo
will be. in all probability, the apparatus devised
by Herr Szczepanik, known as the telclectroscope, by
means of which actual scenes are made visible to
people hundreds of miles away from the spot where
they occur. The machine, it is said, has not yet been
perfected, but experiments made with it have been so
far successful that the inventor, it is reported, has re
ceived $1,250,000 for the exclusive right to use the
patent at the exposition and in France generally.
According to the London correspondent of the
New York Sun the machine is a development of the
kinctoscope. only it performs much more marvelous
feats than that invention. The scene which is to be
transmitted is divided into a number of points, each
of which is reflected in a mirror, and the reflected
ray of light is then converted into an electric current
which can be sent to almost any distance and again
converted into the corresponding .ight ray. As these
rays are thrown upon a screen in rapid succession
the result to the observer is a picture something like
that exhibited by the kinetoscope.
Great expectations are cherished of the possibilities
of the machine. If it is brought to anything like the
perfection hoped for it will enable persons many miles
distant to watch theatrical performances, games of
all kinds, and even battles that are not too widely
extended. It might even save people the trouble r.:id
cost of going to Paris to see the exposition, for
scenes in the various buildings could be transmitted
easily to surrounding countries, and possibly across
the ocean.
It goes without saying, however, that if the ma
chine is anything like equal to what the inventor
claims for it the world will not have to wait until the
Paris exposition opens in iooo to see it. There will in
all probability be a large field for it in Cuba before
long, and we shall then learn what it can do in the
way of showing battles in operation to people who
do not care to go to the battle-fields to see them.
Herr Szczepanik is in a fair way to achieve fame, and
it is to be regretted that his name can never become
popular.
There must be a ferocious set of people down in
Cuba when it is no longer safe for Clara Barton to
remain in the island.
CONGRESS HAS SPOKEN.
WITH a promptness which will be hailed with
gratification throughout the country, the two
houses of Congress have reconciled their dif
ferences and taken action on the Spanish crisis. Those
who have feared that the situation threatened a dead
lock are now relieved, and those who all along have
had an unshaken confidence in the wisdom and
patriotism of the representatives of the people have
occasion to rejoice that their faith was well founded.
The resolution adopted is somewhat in the nature
of a compromise, but it surrenders nothing of any
principle at stake. The only difference at issue be
tween the majority in the Senate and that in the
House was one of policy more than anything else,
and the basis of agreement was therefore reached
without engendering dissatisfaction on either side.
It is needless to say that the great mass of the peo
ple will be well pleased with the end of the debate.
When the bulletin announcing the resolution agreed
upon by the conference committee was placed upon
The Call bulletin boards it was greeted with cheers
by the crowds that had gathered to wait the news be
fore sleeping. When later on it was added that the
Senate had accepted the conference report the ch-ers
were louder and longer. At last, when the news came
that the House also had adopted the resolution, the
outburst of applause was as prolonged and as exultant
as if a great victory had been already achieved for the
Union and for Cuba,
By the resolution Congress declares that the Cu
bans are and of right ought to be free. This waives
the question of recognizing the Junta Government,
but leaves no doubt of the intention of the United
States to drive Spain from the island and secure the
Cubans in the enjoyment of their independence. With
that declaration the people will be satisfied. It throws
down the gantlet to Spain. She must retire or fight.
Nor can there be any doubt of what the consequence
will be. Spain will fight. We shall have war. The
Maine will be avenged.
DEMOCRATIC GOVERNORS.
T a meeting of the Democratic State Commit
/â A tee on Saturday last San Francisco was urged
I \ as a meeting place for the next State conven
tion on the ground that the party is always lucky
when it nominates a gubernatorial candidate in that
city. To practical people this may seem a curious
reason for locating a State convention, yet the facts
upon which it is based are unassailable.
Perhaps holding Democratic conventions in San
Francisco has had nothing to do with the election of
Democratic Governors, but it is nevertheless a fact
that even- time the party has nominated a candidate
elsewhere for over thirty years it has been with a sin
gle exception defeated.
During the Civil War period the Democrats were
pretty effectually kept out of office in California. The
Union party in successive elections carried the State,
and the People's party â a relic of the Vigilance Com-
mittee â ruled San Francisco. In 1867, however, the
Democracy broke the line with Governor Haight.
who was nominated by a convention held in this city
on June 19 of that year. His opponent, George C.
Gorham, was selected at Sacramento. Four years later
the Democrats, made reckless by success, held their
convention at Sacramento and renominated Haight.
He was defeated by Newton Booth. In 1875, having
apparently learned a valuable lesson, the State con
vention was again assembled at San Francisco. Wil
liam Invin was nominated and elected. In 1879 a fu
sion Democratic convention met at Sacramento. It
nominated Hugh J. Glenn, who was defeated. In 188.3
George Stoneman was nominated at San Jose and
elected, but when the Democrats nominated E. B.
Pond at the same place in 1890 they lost the fi^ht. In
the meantime, however (1886), they had won with
Washington Bartlett, who was nominated in this city.
The defeat of the San Jose candidate, as in the case
of Haight, seemed to have conveyed its lesson, for in
1894 the Democratic convention was again held in this
city. James H. Budd was nominated and elected.
This record shows that since the Civil War the
Democrats have nominated but one successful candi
date for Governor outside of this city. It is scarcely
a source of wonder, therefore, that the politicians of
that party have grown superstitious on the subject of
San Francisco gubernatorial candidates. Nor does the
Republican record serve to clear away the notion that
the place in which conventions are held has some
thing to do with the fate of the "head of the ticket."
Since 1867 the Republicans have elected three Gover
nors â Booth, Perkins and Markham. All three were
nominated by conventions held at Sacramento.
It is possible, of course, that the Democrats may
some time choose a candidate for Governor outside
of this city and win with him at the polls, but the
prospects, if the record of thirty years is put in evi
dence, would not seem to be flattering. Good judg
ment, undoubtedly, dictates that all Democratic State
conventions should be held in this city. Local hotel
keepers and others who profit by assemblages of the
unterrified will probably rejoice to know that it is un
safe to nominate Democratic candidates elsewhere,
and, if they do their duty in propagating the notion,
it is not unlikely that the politicians of that party
will soon settle down to the theory that State conven
tions in this city are political necessities. It is too bad
that Republican enndidates have to be nominated at
Sncrnmento. Otherwise we might scare the bo^cs
into holding the conventions of all parties in this
city.
Don Carlos thinks Spain should have landed an
army and captured the United States a year ago.
There is something about this which suggests the woe
of the infant when refused the moon, and it also re
calls the dread dark days when Chile almost conclud
ed to disembark 10.000 men at San Francisco and have
them sweep to New York, leaving a broad trail of
first-class desolation.
Germany's plan to seize Samoa because it thinks
this country and England too busy to prevent the
theft shows the lofty spirit which permeates the
diplomacy of Europe. Apparently it is no more ad
mirable than the sneak-thievery which strips a clothes
line.
Spanish emissaries have set out for the purpose of
conferring with the insurgents. It will be remem
bered that in the past trie emissaries who have tried
this have been shot, and no armistice has been recog
nized by the Cubans.
Spain's Consul has left Key West under different
circumstances from those marking the departure of
Lee from Havana. The Spanish gentleman can't
come back without an invitation.
When Havana papers sneer at Clara Barton and
her work intelligent people understand that the pa
pers are edited by blackguards..
THE SAX FTtAyCISCQ CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 19, 1898.
"REMEMBER THE MOINE."
WHILE Congress is discussing the bearing of
international law upon the affair with Spain
hostile preparations go steadily ahead. That
war can be avoided is the dream of a vain hope. That
there must be the clash of arms is as certain as any
thing known to the human intelligence, save death
alone.
Discussion concerning the course of procedure is
necessary. There are prescribed methods which
needs be respected, forms which have to be duly
weighed, the opinion of other nations, precedents,
consequents. To all this Congress is expected to pay
due attention. The people wait with patience until a
conclusion shall be reached. They do not care so
much for the manner in which the final step shall be
taken. They are interested in the step and the result.
But the men who will do the fighting, the brave
sailors of the navy, the marines, the volunteers, the
commanders of battle-ships, the regular soldiers
marching away to. nameless graves, have but one
thought. It is of the Maine. Diplomacy may in
dulge in sounding periods, may delay, may hide its
purpose behind an array of verbiage, but the truth
that the wreck of the Maine is to be the real cause of
war cannot be hidden. The navy feels that a crime
has been committed. It longs for a proper vengeance.
To achieve this it is willing, from admiral to the hum
ble passer of coal, to go out upon the broad sea and
there do battle, not for Cuba; but that a great wrong
has been done and expiation is necessary and right.
They demand this. They are ready to give their lives
to back the demand.
In this self-sacrifice there is a mighty lesson. Peo
ple who have nothing but money at stake are willing
to forget the Maine, are anxious to leave to arbitra
tion the adjudication of the price of ship and seamen.
But the navy is actuated by a different and a loftier
feeling. It favors no tribunal, no regretful dole of
coin. It is convinced that such concession would be
a stain upon its honor, that at the cannon's mouth its
appeal for retribution must be made. It will man the
cannon. It will challenge the peril of the deep, the
torpedo, the broadside; it will send its gunners up the
military mast, there to perish, and the gunners are
clamoring for a chance to go to their doom. They
are saying to each other, "Remember the Maine."
To any who will make inquiry of his neighbor, of
his own intelligence, will come the assurance that the
war with Spain is not because that country has
abused its subjects, not because it has used famine
as a weapon and spread desolation throughout a fair
and productive land, but because the bones of a
noble craft are bleaching in the harbor of Havana.
It is not competent now to say why they are there.
Even if accident sent them to the bottom with their
human load Spiin treated the catastrophe in a way
which has given to it all the sinister aspect of design.
From the wreck of the Maine is springing an aveng
ing fleet. The explosion which marked her going
down marked also the end of the power of Castile in
the West. There are ships still afloat which may
thunder at the walls of Morro. But there is a ship,
silent, motionless, tenanted only by the dead, a tangle
of steel, a tomb and a monument, which is still the
potent factor in shaping the destiny of a nation. Its
guns will never speak again, but for every one of
them a hundred guns are ready. When first the ships
of the United States and Spain meet our sailors will
remember the Maine, and in the remembrance will
be. the strength of purpose and power in action.
"Remember the Maine"; it is a righteous and in
spiriting war cry.
THE YELLOW INGOLLS.
THE war situation calls into action every agency
of slander and detraction directed against the
administration. The Hearst papers offer a mar
ket to every insinuation, rumor, falsehood and cal
umny that reflects upon the President.
The fellow who seems to have the most of this
feculence for sale is Ingalls, the ex-Senator. He is:
"Like a peach that's got the yeuows
With the meanness breakin' out,"
described in the Bigelow Papers.
With a disloyal disregard of the country's interests,
he obeys instructions to abuse the President for
everything that is done or left undone. With as much
knowledge of war and tactics as a hog has of bicycle
riding, he plans campaigns and military movements;
and, with a quality of statesmanship fitted to the size of
a boodler in some "solid" ring in a City Council, he
treats of international questions as if international
law were the season's rule for baseball or slugging
matches. His viperous temper is armed with a vocab
ulary of vituperation that would be the envy of a
costermonger, and loyalty to his country sits as lightly
upon him as propriety on a Chinese boatwoman.
He knows just where to place the poison of an in
sinuation, where to plant the sting of a half-lie filled
with the venom of a whole lie. His ingenuity is ad
dressed to making other men seem as evil as he is.
Loyalty to country and fidelity to trust, in others, are
mirrors in which he sees his own petty and evil genius
reflected. His intellectual gift is the invention of a
bad motive for a good act, and the dragging down of
high purpose to the gutter wherein he roots and
grunts and makes the air foul. He is employed to de
fame the President for pay, to injure his country for
hire, to make men seem worse, for a consideration.
He tnkes a contract to spread moral pestilence for the
benefit of Hearst's yellow papers.
He is the costumer and modiste of Hearst's wanton
journals. Out of his stock of English defiled he daubs
rouge and henna, grease paints the wrinkles of de
bauchery, and sprinkles meen fun, to repair the fading
attractions of the yellow creatures and suspend for a
time the public aversion to that pair of painted
hussies.
Tosell papers he strikes at the Government of which
he was once a member, demoralizes politics which
were bettered by his retirement to private life, and
weakens every national energy that can be affected by
the virus of his abandoned mind.
The time is coming when the suppression of such
creatures will be demanded by the public safety.
When everything is in peril and all that men have is
at stake, in the great war that is now so near the pant
ing of gunners may be heard as they load and range
the guns, no yellow-jacket like Ingalls. whose sole
talent is in his sting, will be permitted to annoy the
chosen leader of the people or weaken the avenging
arm of the country by directing it to aim a false blow.
If in war the civil law is not silent it will be found
equipped with resources to silence those who, by ly
ing, make dissension at home and strengthen the
enemy abroad.
The Bakers and the Howards of Kentucky have a
nice new feud which, during: its existence of ten days,
has resulted in filling ten graves and four hospital
cots. Steps should be taken to ship this feud to
Cuba.
It seems almost a hardship that notwithstanding the
heavy mortality for March not a Supervisor nor a
School Director was on the list.
WHY AN EVENING PAPER
GIVES WAY TO WRATH
After a lucid Interval of surprising length the Bulletin Is again in the throes of unseemly anger. As usual in this
condition, it attacks The Call. There is no occasion for vituperation, and no inclination to respond to the eventngpaper
in its own terms. The question Involved is a matter of business. A collateral question is one of manners, but it Is a
waste of time to attempt to teach the Bulletin how to behave. All the woe of the evening sheet is brought upon itself
It announced with impressive display that it had secured the exclusive right to war news collected by the New York
Herald. It said this service was the most complete in the world, wherein it was right. But The Call having already bi
cured this .-^rvice, did not understand how its contemporary could also have it, together with the right to proclaim it
as exclusive. In places the Bulletin spoke of a "day" service, but growing enthusiastic In contemplation of its own
unwonted enterprise, it set forth that it was to have all the Herald war news. Naturally The Call, through its New
York representative, notified the Herald that any such arrangement would be In violation of a contract already in force
with this paper. It did this to protect its own rights.
Promptly a reply came from the New York representative that the arrangement with the Bulletin had been knocked
out, and adding other details. It was at this juncture the wrath of the evening paper became spectacular. The char
acter of the message it sent to New York may be gathered from the telegrams published herewith. It had not been
accused of lying, but the tenderness of its conscience caused it to declare that it had. In so declaring it did lie. But
what is to be expected of the Bulletin? There is no occasion for even mild surprise.
These controversies do not interest the public. It is only desired to make plain that the Herald war news Is printed
by The Call; that no other publication in San Francisco can get it. There is nothing to hinder the Bulletin from pre
senting it the evening of the same day it has appeared in this paper. The evening sheet asserts that The Call knew i
contract had been signed by the Bulletin. It did not know It. And in the proper spirit of investigation, it upset the
scheme. It seems that the service was not what the Bulletin advertised that it was to be, but doubtless it would
have possessed great news value. By boasting unduly and untruly, by setting forth that it had procured that which It
had no means of procuring, the Bulletin brought about its own undoing. It said, among other things, this: "The
Bulletin has finally closed a contract with the New York Herald for the exclusive use on this coast of its magnificent
news service, which undoubtedly is the best in the world."
Now this, according to a telegram from the Herald, according to The Call's contract, was not so, and could not
have been so. Yet even the news the Bulletin would have got, its lack of modesty has taken away from it. It counted
unhatched chickens and then kicked over the basket of eggs. Now it Is filling the air with epithets, and giving evi
dences of temper. Meanwhile the "best news service In the world" is at the disposal of The Call. It is to be hoped
the Bulletin may accept the inevitable with what grace It may, and cultivate a more benign frame of mind.
THE BULLETIN SHOWS A DISREGARD FOR FACT.
WHfIT THE DRUMS SflY
Hark! I hear the tramp of thousands.
And of armed men the hum;
Lo! a nation's hosts have (gathered
Around the quick alarming drum-
Pay lnt?, "Come,

alarming drum.
"T,#>t me of my heart take counsel;
War la not of life the sum;
Who shall stay and reap the harvest
When the autumn days have come?"
But the drum
Rchoed, "Come!
Death shall reap tlif braver harvest,'" said the
solemn-sounding drum.
"Hut when won the comin* battle.
What of profit springs therelroroT
What if conquest, subjugation,

But the drum

Yankee-answering drum.
What If, 'mid the cannon's thuiri ?r.

Wlien my brothers fall around me,

But the drum
Answered, "Come!

new.RECEPTION HALL OF THE MASONIC HOME.
Ample Funds Secured for Its Adornment nu the Adoption of a
Unique Plan.
Plans for the splendid reception-hall of the Home for Widows and Orphans that the Masons have projected have
been definitely agreed upon, and when the building is finished this hall will be the especial pride of all who contributed
to its beauty and grandeur.
As the accompanying illustration shows, the room is of magnificent dimensions, and it was at first intended to finish
it plainly in uregon pine, but R. P. Hurlbut suggested a plan whereby it was made possible to beautify it in a manner
at once novel and at the same time self-paying. There will be a marble wainscoting, a superb marble staircase,
tiled flooring, and from the top of the wainscoting ornamental tiles will be placed extending to the beams, and these tiles
are to be the means of providing funds for the entire cost.
Evfry person who contri!>utcs $5 to the fund will have his or her name engTaved upon one of these tiles, a lasting
monument to the giver's generosity. The plan has met with the approval of everybody who has heard of it, and many
subscriptions have already been pledged. Any Masonic bodies desiring to have their good deed permanently and con
spicuously recorded will be given tiles considerably larger than those for Individuals at a slightly increased cost.
So popular has this idea become that it has" been decided to set apart a space 10x50 feet on the front of the build
ing, on which will be inscribed the names of all who donate $1 to the good cause.
Interest in the festival at the Mechanics' Pavilion in aid of the home is steadily increasing, and its success Is al
ready assured. The Italian Masons are working with a will, under the leadership of James A. Devoto and F. Cavag
naro, to help it along, and the local colony promises to contribute something unique that will also be of material benefit.
The special administrators of the estate of the late James G. Fair have given their promise to assist the home.
MINISTER WHO
OPPOSES WAR
Rev. A.M. Elston Believes
Fighting to Be Un-
christian.
The Press Charged With In
flaming the Passions of
the Masses.
Mceung3 of the V ar i O us Denorn-i
national Representatives
Yesterday.
Prnf, ?r-.->r A. M. Elston, of the 'Berke
ley Bible College, in his talk before the
Christian Ministers' Association yesterday,
gave some reasons for being strongly op
posed to this country entering into" hostili
ties with Spain. He deplored the fact
that the press and even the pulpit were
tryir.p; to inflame the passions of the
masses in an endeavor to brine about
â war.
The reverend gentleman took as a text
â¢::arks "You shall hear of wars
and rumors of wars," Matthew 24, vi.
In part he said:
Although not directly applicable to the pres
ent contention, yet by the principle of accom
modation these words may refer to the present
warlike condition of the .rid. True, there
are wars and rumors of wars. Wars Imminent
and wars universal. The press, the pulpit and
the masses are clamoring for war. Not only
are the newspapers inflamlng-publlc passion, but
even the floodgates of public oratory have been
opened with inflammatory appeals for war. The
Rev. Thomas Dixon of New York 13 reported
to have said last Sunday in his sermon: "The
eweejilncr of the last vestige of Spanish tyr
anny from the Western Hemisphere will not be
enough. The nation that would ignore the
blowing up of the Maine and overlook that
foul blow to its honor, that black crime of the
century, Is dead and rotten and ought to be
in hell. 1 '
Are the masses Improved by such an appeal
to their passions? Are such sentiments born
of the spirit of Jesus? Was such wholesale
â laughter and relegating to hell the nature that
ignored it, Christ's method of redeeming na
tions and making them righteous? Is war to
be exalte*! by the press, the pulpit and the na
tion as the mightiest thins; instead of a relic
of barbarism? Do we worship the principle of
peace or the gods of battles? Such things to
my mind are a travesty on the ethics of Chris
tianity.
Professor Elston then went on to show
the Effects of war from an economic and
moral standpoint, and in support of his
contention, quoted many leading author
ities.
The problem of the unemployed was
tted by Rev. Edward E. Clark
at the Presbyterian Ministers' Union yes
terday, and was I'scussed very thorough
ly. Before adjournment Rev. O. C. Mil
ler led in a ten -minute prayer for the

At the Methodist Ministers' meeting, an

participated.
If President McKinley to-day

The Yordi Inquest.
ALAMEDA. April ]s.â A Coroner's in
quest was hekl this morning; upon the re
mains of Miss Mar;/ Yordi, who died Sat
urday evening- from the effects of burns
from a gasoline stove. It was developed
that the stove did not explode, but must
! have been leaky, as the fluid ran on the !
; outside and was ignited, and it was while
carrying the blazing object from the room
that the poor woman received her fatal
Injuries. A verdict was rendered in ac- i
cordance with the facts as stated.
WEIGHT WILL CONTEST.
Attorney Talcott Threatened to Fight
to Gain Admittance to a
Sickroom.
OAKLAND, April 18.â Judge Ellsworth
partially heard the contest over the pro
bate of the late George T. Wright's will.
The deceased was a son of Captain
George T. Wright, and his wife filed a
sensational $25,000 damage suit against hÂ«r
father-in-law just before his death.
H. D. Talcott testified that he drew up
the will and threatened to thrash Dr.
Krone if he interfered with the witness
visiting Mr. Wright. He said that a tele
phone conference was held with Dr. Mul
ler, after which he was given permission
to go to the sickroom. When asked what
he would have done provided his demands
were refused, Mr. Talcott answered
"Somebody would have been badly
thrashed."
The estate affected was the son's in
terest in his mother's estate, which has
never been probated. It is alleged that
the captain's second wife is the cause of
the trouble, and that the son while sick
was not ciired for by his father as ho
should have been. This Captain Wright
denies and says he did all he should have
dune.

PATRIOTIC POLICEMEN.
They Will Be Given a Chance to As
sist in Whipping Spain.
At the meeting of the Police Commis
sioners last night a resolution was passed
allowing all the members of the depart
ment who so desire to join the active
forces of the Unitea States in case of war
with Spain. Their places will be filled by
other men, who will be expected to re
tlre as soon as the regular officers shall
I have returned. The resolution was
I brought about by the following letter
! from Policeman T. A. Atchison 01 the
Central station:
Chief Lees Esq -Dear Sir: There now seems
to be a reasonable prospect of a call bein- Is
sued by the President of the United States for
volunteers to enforce the resolutions passed hv
Con B re ? s as well as to give the Spaniards the
whipping they so richly deserve. In all wars
which this country has been engaged there
was at least one of our family holding a com
mission In some branch of the army of Uncle
Pam. I have the assurance that a commis
sion will be tendered me In the volunteers
i should they be called out. and I do not want
I to be an exception to the rule of our family
I I would not trouble you at all only for the
j fact that there Is a wife and four children de
pendent upon me, and believing trouble with
I Spain would be over In from four to six
I months, I wish to ascertain if on my re
turn to the city a position on the force would
be open to me. Kindly advise me If such ar
rangements could be made, and oblige Yours
respectfully, T. A. ATCHISON
Police Officer.
After the letter was read the following
I resolution was drawn up and adopted:
Resolved, That in the event of war between
| the United States and Spain all police
| officers of the City and County of San
Francisco who may tender their services
to the Government In the army or navy or In
any other official ca|*acity and shall actually
serve during the war shall on their return
if they bo desire, be reinstated, and that the
men appointed to fill their places during their
temporary absence shall nt onoe vacate ThÂ«
men filling surh vacancies will, however re-
I ceive the pay of the police officers who have
temporarily laid aside their stars to fight for
their flag and country.
After the adoption of the resolution the
Commissioners toojt un the eases of Pnt
rick Perry, charged with being intoxi
cated while on duty, and Policeman Vor
aky, charged with being off his beat for
a period of four hours. Both cases were
dismissed, but the accused officers were
i severely reprimanded for their conduct

The Printers' Strike.
The printers' strike is still going on
quietlyâ in fact, so quietly that, as Mr.
Crocker observed yesterday, "I hardly
know that there Is a strike going on."
The -union men claim that negotiations
are pending with two offices which they
think will be won before the week Is out
while the Typothetae claim that they are
positive that this is false. Delegates
from the strike committee visited the
various outside unions which mot last
night and made an appeal for llnancial
assistance, which was answered in every
case, and in most cases the assurance
was given that there was plenty more as
soon as it was called for. This will be
pay-day with strikers again and funds
from the International have arrived so
the money collected can be used for out
side purposes.
The Typothetae claim to have already
won the battle, and the printers say the
victory will be theirs within two weeks
at the furthest.

CANNOT DELAY
ANOTHER YEAR
Bad Crops Will Drive
Many Into the
Cities.
Land Offered fcr the Pingree
Plan Ample for a
Start.
New Organization May Be Effected
to Provide for the
Winter.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, April 15.
Over a year ago an organization was
effected in this city for the purpose of
carrying out the system of relief known
as the Pingree plan. A committee was
appointed months ago to make inquiry
regarding ttie amount of land that wouid
be placed at the disposal of the organiza
tion when it was ready to commence op
erations.
It was the original Intention to have
the plan in effect for last winter, but
nothing was done of a practical nature
and on acount of the improved conditions
of the industrial classes its need was not
felt. This winter, however, on account
of the partial failure of the fruit and
grain crops in some places and total
failure in others, will decidedly be a hard
one for many of those who depend on
agriculture. The consequence of this will
be that a large population will drift into
the cities, where they will have to be sup-
ported. These circumstances have so im
pressed themselves on some of the active
supporters of the Pingree system that
they believe an early start should be
made to put into effect that which has
been the subject of discussion for over a
year.
Mayor Thomas was at the head of the
former organization, but owing to his
many dutii-.s at the City Hall he will prob
ably be relieved of the responsibility.
A member of the committee who has
been very active in brir.ging the matter
up to a point where it is practicable said
to-day that there is no doubt during the
next winter thousands of people from the
valleys to the south will come to Oakland,
and {he Pinerree plan is the mo3t feasible
method of supporting them.
"The report of the committee showed
that there is a large quantity of available
vacant lots which the owners are only too
willing to place at the disposal of any
responsible party," said he. "It is a pity
that a start was not made last year, even
in a small way. because it would have
been a lesson the experience from which
would be invaluable this coming winter.
It is not an expensive plan to carry out;
in fact, it requires practically no money
except for seeds and plants. It will be
too late to start in when winter is here,
and the proper time to begin is now. A
great many people, on account of the de
lays that have occurred, are of the opin
ion that the project ha,s been abandoned;
but while its original committee may. per
haps, have lost some of its enthusiasm,
it cannot further be ignored."
DETERMINED BURGLARS.
Two Attempts Made to Rob an Ark.
Would-Be Thieves Fired Upon
Without Effect.
ALAMEDA, April: ft.â An old man
named Charles Raddetz has lived for
many years in an ark on the San Lean
dro bay marsh at the foot of San Jose
avenue, this city. He is reputed to be
well-to-do, and this report has apparent
ly attracted the attention of some would
be thieves, who decided to make a raid
on the place. About a fi rtnight ago
Raddetz was aroused from his slumber
one night by the noise of some one try
ing to gain an entrance to the door of
his habitation. He very quietly got out
of bed, noiselessly opened a window and
pokf-d a shotgun â which he kept for such
emergencies out of the aperture. With
out trying to take aim he fired both bar
rels, whereupon two men ran from the
place down the road. He could see them
but indistinctly and of course could not
recognize them.
On Wednesday evening last Raddetz
had been downtown until rather a late
hour. lie was proceeding quietly toward
the ark, when lie saw a man sneaking
about it, while another stood in the road
appaicntly as a sentinel. Thereupon
Raddetz gained the beach and crept along
it until he reached the back of his ark.
By this time the fellow whom he had
seen about the place was fumbling with
the lock on the front door. The one in
tho road called out to him and asked
him why he did not open the door, and
the other replied that it had a Yale lock
and he could not gain admittance. There
upon Raddetz, who had a pistol with him,
1 c'-.: up and fired all the cartridges it
contained at the burglars. He does not
know whether he hit them or not, as they
at once took to flight and made good
their escape. Raddetz says he is not
afraid, but is prepared to give a warm
reception to any intruder who may try
and break into his place.
ESCAPED THE AVALANCHE.
A Newspaper Man's Close Coll on the
Chilkoot Passâ The Merest
Chance.
ALAMEDA, April 18.â A letter was re
ceived to-day from Walter R. Weeks, of
the Daily Encinal of this city, conveying
the welcome news to his friends and rel
atives that he had escaped the terrible
avalanche which did such destruction on
the Chilkoot Pass on the 3d of this month.
The letter was written on the day the
disaster occurred and before its full ex
tent was known. Weeks had been en
gaged in packing his outfit from the
Sheep Camp to the Scales. On the morn
ing of the accident he had to get a sup
ply of wood for his camp, and so was ont
on tho trail, over which ho had been pass
ing regularly for several day-8 with por
tions of his outfit. There were rumors
of tho loss of anywhere between fifty
and throe hundred men, and he saw
eighteen or twenty brought in shortly
after the disaster. Most of his outfit was
at Scales, and he expected that it had
bof-n buried beneath the avalanche, but
said that he did not care about that so
long as he was alive, as be realized what
a narrow escape he had had.

ABUNDANCE
OF WATER
No Need for Berkeley
to Risk Annual
Droughts.
Millions of Gallons Could Be
Piped at a High
Pressure.
Report* or Engineers Show That *
Good Supply Is Easily-
Available.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, April 18.
The lack of water in the district north
of Oakland has led to prospecting in the
hilly district in the southern portion of
Contra Costa County. Experts sent out
by interested parties have made reports
which tend to prove that within six miles
of Berkeley there Is a supply of water
entirely free from mineral or alkali and
amounting to 200,000 gallons per day at
the present time without any attempt at
development.
George F. Allardt of this city and T.
A. McMahon ,of Martinez, both well
known civil engineers, report that there
is a very feasible site for a reservoir be
low Bear Creek Falls. These falls are
located In the center of Rancho la Boca
de la Canada del Pinole, six miles north
east of the town of Berkeley, and twelve
miles from Oakland. There Is a water
shed there of five thousand acres, gen
erously supplied with lakes and BprTner?
of pure soft mountain water. This res
ervoir has a capacity of seven hundred
million gallons of water.
For the past twenty-five years a record
of the rainfall on this district shows that
it has been nineteen inches per annum,
which would guarantee an average daily
supply to the reservoir of two million gal
lons.
This natural site for a reservoir is 535
feet above sea level, and there is an easy
grade along the county road for a pipe
line to Berkeley, to Point Richmond, to
Crockett and Port Costaâ all along the
county road. The reservoir site consists
of ninety acres of land and meets with
very favorable commendation from the
engineers.
On the property of Simon Blum at the
head of Alharnbra Valley is another
water supply that only neeas development
to be valuable to Martinez, Crockett and
Port Costa. It is located on the same
ranch, and this reservoir has an elevation
of 450 feet above tide water, and accord
ing to the estimate of the engineers has a
capacity of seventy-five million gallons.
About 60,000 gallons of pure water from
tunnel and springs run through the res
ervoir daily.
A project Is on foot to develop and util
ize those water supplies co as to make it
impossible for there to be any Berious
drought in any of the towns between
Berkeley and Martinez. These reports of
the engineers may also have some effct
on the operation of the new sugar mill,
which was formerly Starr's flour mill, at
Crockett. At the nresent time the ques
tion of an adequate water supply is caus
ing some anxiety to the management, and
it is believed that it was partly due to
the desire of the sugar mill people that
the recent surveys and reports were
made.
OPPOSED THE
CONGREGATION
The Official Board Is Badly
Defeated After a
Hearing.
Old Thirty-Fourth-Street Methodist.
Episcopal Church Fight
Renewed.
OAKLAND, April IS.â The unusual spec
tacle of the official representatives of a
church opposing the wishes <v those who
elected them is presented in the 'inirty
fourth street M. E. Church. The official
board of that organization has opposed
the congregation and attempted to depose
their pastor against the unanimous pro
test of the congregation. The represent
atives who do not represent have been
defeated, however, and Rev. John Kirby,
presiding elder of this district, refuses to
grant the prayer of the disgruntled
board.
As a result two have resigned and
left the church, but others seem deter
mined to stay. The present trouble arose
out of the interpretation of the ecclesi
astical law by Rev. E. Francis Brown,
the present pastor. Three years ago the
church was rent with discord and many
of the members left. Mr. and Mrs. J. M.
Van Every and their son, O. Van Every,
were among the disturbing element at
that time, as they are at present. Mr.
Van Every was once the pastor here, but
in the middle of his second year resigned
and passed in his credentials to avoid
puhlicity regarding some unpleasantness.
This family have taken a prominent part
in the affair, and It is claimed by Brown's
friends that the pastor"s rigid interpreta
tion of Methodism and outspoken words
regarding morality were the causes of
their bitterness.
At any rate, the official board, con
sisting of the Van Everys, George C. Hall
and wife, Lester Hiscox, Mr*. "W. A.
Rouse and Mr. and Mrs. August Dow, pe
titioned the presiding elder, John Kirby.
to remove Mr. Brown from the pastorate
of the church. The members of the con
gregation learned of the proposed move
and sent a counter petition, signed by al
most every other member and outsiders
attending the church, asking for his re
tention. As there was no charge of mis
conduct against the pastor, and a change
of pastorate in the middle of the year was
almost an unheard of state of affairs ex
cept in the grossest cases, the elders
called a meeting Of the board and with
the pastor attended the meeting.
During the session Mr. Brown stated
openly with the three Van Everys present
that "If Mr. Van Every had the least
sense of propriety he would be a thousand
miles distant from this place, instead of
being here disturbing the harmony of a
church he had nearly ruined."
No answer was made by the man at
tacked and the congregation's request for
the continuance of the pastorate was
granted. Mr. and Mrs. A. Dow with
drew from the church, but the others re
mained.
"The church Is prospering despite this
difficulty," said Mr. Brown to-night. "We
are taking in new members right along
and all of the former ones except the
board are in accord with the pastor's
actions. lam sorry this affair has be
come public, but the church's representa
tives do not represent the congregation's
views in this matter, hence they must
act for themselves."

How the Expedition From
Oakland Saw the
Eclipse.
Professor Burckhalter Returns
and Tells of His
Success.
Believes He HÂ«s the Best Plates or
the Event Taken by Any
Astronomer.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. April 13.
Professor Burckhalter of the Chabot
â  Observatory, who has just returned from
j India, is very sanguine of the complete
j success of his expedition. He is assured
| that aJI his plates are perfect and in ex
cellent condition, and that the investment,
from a scientific point of view, is very
| satisfactory.
On his trip to India Mr. Burckhalter
I took both the lenses donated by Mr. Pier
son of San Franciscc and Dr. Pardee of
Oakland, and used them In connection
with his own invention for photographing
the sun's corona. He is well pleased with
the result.
The camp of the Chabot expedition was
| about two miles from that of Professor
I Campbell and the Lick Observatory party.
j The British Government kindly undertook
I to see that the visitors, who had gone so
: far to view the eclipse, were treated with
i every courtesy. The government officers
! furnished the parties with tents and as-
I sistance. On the day of the eclipse the
| interest was so great that thousands of
j people flocked to the vicinity of the
I camps, and it required a detachment of
i police to keep them away so that the
! astronomers could do their work with
| comfort and accuracy. Professor Burck
! haiter's euest at the time of the eclipse
| was the assistant manager of the great
Indian Peninsular Railroad.
While not anxious to say too much
i about his own work, until able to exhibit
j the proofs, Mr. Burckhalter admits that
: his own Invention is the only device which
I gives a distinct photograph of the Inside
! details of an eclipse and the outside cor
! ona at the same time. This morning he
! appeared before his classes at the Central
I Grammar School, and referred briefly to
his trip. Since leaving Oakland October
| 30th of last year, he has been entirely
i around the world, going to India by way
: of Japan and coming home by way of
; the Suez canal and London. He says, !n
| cidentally, that In the present controversy
: with Spain it is easy for a stranger to see
the sympathy of Great Britain is with
the United States.
I VICTORY FOR MRS. MARTIN.
Announces That She Will Reopen
the Celebrated Henry Martin
Will Case.
OAKLAND, April IS.â Mrs. Isabella J.
Martin, who won so much notoriety in
, the Henry Martin will case, in San Fran
cisco three years ago, won a victory in
Judge Greene's court to-day when he ren
dered a verdict in her favor, against
August Larsen, her carpenter.
Larsen sued to recover extras on a
building he erected for Mrs. Martin. She
claimed that he had been paid by lumber
; taken sufficient to build his own home.
She also raised the point that as the suit
was not filed (or three years it should
be dismissed, and was sustained in this
point by the court.
She was much pleased at the result, and
later stated that she would reopen the
Henry Martin case, which she fought so
obstinately. She has engaged attorneys
and will soon have the case in court
again.
Mrs. Waterman's Funeral.
BERKELEY, April 18.â The funeral of
Mrs. S. D. Waterman, wife of Professor
Waterman, principal of the Berkeley
High School, took place this afternoon

which Mrs. Waterman was a member.
Rev. John Coyle conducted the services,
which were attended by hundreds of
Berkeleyans, students and former stu
dents of the High School and others. All
of the public schools of Berkeley were
closed out of respect to the memory of
the deceased. The pall bearers were:
Frank Hull, A. W. Naylor, Lorenzo Ken
nedy, Simeon Hackley. Samuel Martin
and John Hausman. The interment was
in Mountain View Cemetery.

A WORD OF WARNING.
Regarding the Water You Use dust at
This Tims of the Year.
In these days there is such a univer
sal interest in the water we drink that
anything bearing upon the subject is
eagerly read by the public. "It is evi
dent." says a New York Medical Jour
nal, "that the necessity of using ab
solutely pure drinking water cannot
become too strongly impressed on the
public mind, but water in that condi
tion is provided by very few communi
ties. Where such water cannot be
obtained, the ordinary drinking water,
if the least suspicion attaches to it,
should be boiled before using. Precau
tions should be taken at all times of
the year."
There are few ordinary drinking
waters that do not contain traces of
impure matter and poisonous germs,
invisible to the naked eye. If these
enter the system at a favorable time,
disease will ensue. Boiling and freez
ing, it has been shown, often fall to
destroy these dangerous foes to health.
It is known, however, that the addi
tion of a little pure spirit to contami
nated water will render it perfectly
harmless. It is recommended that
pure whiskey be used for this purpose.
The one absolutely pure medicinal,
whiskey known to the world is Duffy'3
Pure Malt. Scientists admit this, doc
tors confirm it. and the public has
proven it. There is no difficulty in
counteracting the poisons in drinking
water if this pure whiskey is used.
Care should be observed, however, to
secure Duffy's, as it is a pure medici
nal whiskey, and will accomplish what
you desire.

KLONDIKE'S
GOLDEN
HARVEST
The Output of the District
Will Run Upward of
Twelve Millions.
Conservative Estimate Made Up
From a Personal Inspection
of Every Working
Mine,
BY SAM WALL.
Total estimated output for this year of the Klondike and Indian
River divisions of the Yukon mining districts, based on a personal in
spection of every working mine in those districts by Sam W. Wall,
$27,640,000.
Bonanza Creek $12,465,000
hi Dorado Creek 10,727,000
Bi^ and Little Skookum Gulches, including the bench claims 1,000,000
Hunker Creek 2,1 38,000
Bear Creek 500,000
Dominion Creek 1 50,000
Sulphur Creek 150,000
Gay Gulch 300,000 :
Last Chance Creek 100,000 â 
Gold Bottom Creek 60.000 !
All other creeks in the two divisions 50,000
Immediately preceding my coming
away from Dawson â starting "out" â I
made a tour of all the gold-bearing
creeks in the Klondike district; that is,
all the creeks where something more
than prospecting 1 was being done. My
purpose was to gain In advance of the
clean up the best information possible
as to the probable yield of gold. I vis
ited every considerable dump on El
Dorado, Bonanza, Bear, Hunker, Do
minion and Sulphur creeks, talked to
the owners of the claims when they
were to be found, and to the foreman,
laymen and miners on every such
claim. From them I got the results of
their daily pannlngs, from which they
computed the average value of the
dirt. This information was sometimes
freely given and sometimes reluctantly
and sometimes sought by the owners
to be entirely withheld. The mine or
claim owners are not as a rule boast
ful of their possessions now, since the
Canadian Government seeks to take
from them 20 per cent of the output. In
nearly every case, however, I ultimate
ly secured a careful and conservative
estimate from some one connected with
each mine, and can. with them all, sum
up the proba'ule output of the Klondike
ami Indian Kiver districts based upon
something more than a mere vague
guess. (Juesses have been made in
print ranging all the Way from five to
forty millions. The thick run of yel
low metal to be met with in Bonanza
and Xl Dorado creeks or the light trip
ping of the tongue over large figures
that is a familiar part of every man's
conversation In that big country makes
it easy to run to exaggeration. The
great part of the product of this year,
as it did last, will come out of eleven
miles of frozen ground on Bonanza and
four and a half miles more on El Do
rado, and when that is considered the
figures that I have to present as being
the reasonably certain output of the
mines will have their true value in the
forming of an estimate of the country.
It? probabilities and possibilities. The
output of last year â that which roused
the whole world to a stampede the
like of which the world had never seen
before â was one million dollars. Some
few say it was two millions. Creeks
that at that time were jokingly re
ferred to as frog ponds or were not
known at all will this year yield double
the higher amount, and the output of
El Dorado and Bonanza and the other
creeks in the Klondike district, exclu
sive of the Indian River district, will
rise above $27,0uu,000.
The country is a wonderland of gold.
And if I did not know it I would not
say It, for I have seen the nothing

Soon after I was taken ill my hair com-
menced to fall, so that each day more came
out than I thought I had in my bead. I was
turning gray rapidly. Finally I became afraid
to have it combed, but the nurse said that
wouldn't do, and used vaseline to keep it
in, then used beers marrow, then quinine
tonic, and finally (Ccticcea ointment), which
helped it immediately. The nurse said she
rubbed up a fine white dust from the scalp
where she could see nothing before com-
mencing, and the scalp looked healthier and
more natural every day. Now I haven't as
many gray hairs as when I commenced using
Cctici;ra, and I have a crop of fine brown
hair all over my head about an inch and a
half in length. I only lose a few hairs when
combing every day, and always more gray
than brown. My nurse is delighted becausa
the new hairs aro brown. I never had very,
luxuriant hair, even in my youth. It is as
thick on my head today as it ever was, and
Citticuka did it. Mrs. J. M. LAWSON,

less than frightful results of the rush
of unprovisioned and unprepared peo
ple into that frost-bitten land. I have
told about that. I have seen gold
thawed out of the ice in such quantity
as to amaze the miner, and it is none
the less my business to tell about that. I
did not see Alex McDonald take $11,000
from four buckets of dirt gathered
from the bedrock of No. 27, El Dorado,
but I have it on so much authority
that I may say that I know he did so.
I did see single pans of dirt yield as
much as $50 so frequently that it ceased
to be a matter worth noting. I saw a
little girl stand on a dump in El Do
rado and by permission pick up all the
nuggets she could find before the next
bucket came up from the shaft. A few
minutes later the results of her brief
industry were weighed in a neighboring
cabin and developed a value of $35.
They keep a watchman on the dump
at 29 Bonanza in order that no thief
may steal the dirt at night.
But the most important thing that I
have to =ay here Is that this very rich
ground Is not wholly confined to these
two creeksâ Bonanza and El Dorado.
That is the question constantly being
asked, and I am able to answer it. On
June E of last year the first stake
was driven on Dominion Creek. That
waa a little more than ten months ago.
On the 12th there was the usual stam
pede that follows the first reports of a
new disco-very, and a number .f claims
were staked. Then came the custom
ary reaction. Many of those who
joined in the trying summer
Journey over the divides from
Dawson, about twenty-five miles
refused to record their claims
believing them to be of no value. The
stampede became a Joke. Along the
trail as I came over about March 1
last I fc-und remembrances of the spirit
Of fun that it had developed. Posted
upon trees and upon boards that then
scarcely protruded above the snow
were such notices as: "I claim ten
miles of this creek to be used as a
frog pond"; "I claim this tree for
climbing purposes"; "I claim thu sky
above for the purpose of raising an
gels." Very many of those who took
the trouble to make the trip thought
so little of what they secured by it
that they refused to pay the $15 that
it cost to record it and so make it their
own. The techarcos, or new-comers,
knew so little about mining in Alaska,
or the Northwest Territory, and what
constituted reasonably good-looking
ground that some of them built cab
ins and began prospecting. It was only
during the latter part of the winter
that there was a trail from Dawson to
either Dominion or Sulphur Creek that
could be followed with any kind of cer
taint3 r . Now both these creeks are
staked from the hilltop to the mouth,
and claims are valued as high as $100.
000, and the most remote and unpros
pected claims are quoted above a thou
sand. And the change Is not a matter
of mere booming, but is the legitimate
result of what the men who dug in the
ground found there. Out of the pros
pect holes dirt has been taken that
showed two ounces of coarÃe gold to
the pan.
Dominion and Sulphur creeks are
branches of the same stream, empty
ing into Indian River nd the story of
one is the story of both. The owners
of the claims are jubilant, and expect
to see their properties placed in the
class with those of the Bonanza and
El Dorado. This expectation has such
reasonable basis that Joe Barrett, who
owns some of the best properties on
both Bonanza and El Dorado, told me
that If $50,000 was taken out of Dominion
Creek in the clean-up this summer,
in view of the slight development work
that has been done there this winter,
he would put all the money that he
takes out of his first-mentioned prop
erties into the purchase of claims in the
newer field. This is what many of the
so-called bonanza kings will do and are
doing. Alex McDonald, who is the
king of these kings, in that he owns
more rich claims than any other, is do
ing so. He is buying up claims not on
ly on Dominion and Sulphur, but on
many other creeks about which even
less is known. He awns a dozen claims
on both the creeks named. He is build
ing a large storehouse on Dominion
Creek about midway between the two
"Discoveries," to cache supplies for
their development. This summer a per
manent trail will be built, leading over
the divide from Bonanza Creek at Cor
macks down into Sulphur and Domin
ion. Pack trains will be dispatched and
make regular weekly trips from Grand
Forks, the town at the mouth of El
Dorado. Next winter will therefore
witness such scenes of extensive de
velopment on Hunker, Dominion, Sul
phur and perhaps Quartz Creek as we
now find only on Bonanza and El
Dorado in this upper country. A com
pany has 1 oen formed and steps taken
for the building of a telephone line con
necting all these creeks, and it is prob
able that the work will be completed
before the return of winter.
So it is not strange that the habit
of laughing at the stampeder and his
claim because the crei'k located upon
has not been heard of before has gone
out of fashion in the far north. The
result of this winter's prospecting has
THE SA^ FRAXCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 19 1898.
produced such results that a claim up
on any creek within a certain radius,
and bearing a certain relationship to
the discoveries, Is held to have some
speculative value. For that reason
the whole winter has witnessed a con-
Btnjit succession of stampedes, and
creek after creek, gulch after gulch,
has been staked off and recorded. The
Gold Commissioner's office is a small,
single-room, rough-board affair, and
his corps of assistants through a great
part of the winter consisted of two men.
He had several others in the early fall,
but for the lack of provisions was com
pelled to send them to Fort Yukon.
The work of recording was thus inade
quate to meet the conditions, and thus
every day, and all day long, there were
drawn up In front of the office a score
of the latest stampeders, stamping
their feet and swinging their arms to
keep from freezing â often unsuccess
fully â while they awaited their turn to
record.
With the moment that the exodus up
the river and the exodus down the
liver of last fall and the early winter
relieved the town of the fear of star
vation that oppressed and paralyzed
it, the prospecting of new creeks began
and Interest in mining revived and in
creased with each day, as almost each
day brought its rumors of new finds
and new locations. These rumors were
so frequent and most of them had so
little foundation that as the winter
dragged its slow length along they
came to bo little regarded and only
those who took the pains or paid the
price to keep properly posted knew
what to believe. There were a num
ber of these, however, who, having
money, were In a position to take ad
vantage of the situation, and they kept
Bcouts out watching the work of de
velopment on all near by creeks. As
often as good prospects were found
these bought up the neighboring claims
where they could at bargain prices.
A few men, taking advantage of the
necessities of those who lacked money
and particularly of those who lacked
provisions, bought up, or secured op
tions upon claims for the purpose of
sending them "out" to be sold, or of
fered for sale In the mining markets
of the world. Numbers of men found
relief from very embarrassing, not to
say distressing, situations by this
means. They found a ready market
with these so-called brokers or agents
for any claim upon almost any creek
at varying prices, of course, ranging
from $25 to $200. In most cases, how
ever, the broker paid but a few dollars
in money, if any, supplied the stam
peder with provisions, taking an option
on the claim at a fixed price ranging
from $f)00 to $1500 and over, according
to the location, the money to be paid
only In case claim was sold. Brokers
who had a good stock of provisions
often had several men constantly em
ployed ln_ stampeding and securing
claims on these terms. That was in
the early winter. Later this business
got so far beyond the Gold Commis
sioner's ability to record for all appli
cants that he made a terse law of his
own that no man should stake more
than four claims in one year. He based
this ruling on the law which requires
every claim owner to be upon and work
his claim continuously for three
months in the year, and there being
but twelve months in the year no man
could do that, he argued, for more than
four claims.
Numbers of claims were sent out dur
ing the early winter. Ail this time
development work was going on and
every now and then big pay was struck
on this and that among the newly lo
cated creeks. With each new " find
came a panic among those who had
bonded claims, or who, as agent or
broker, had sent them out to be sold
at figures quoted for comparatively un
known ground. Pome of the speediest
journeys from Dawson to Dyea were
made by men who came out to recover
deeds that had been sent out earlier
or to otherwise head off and stop pos
sible sales of claims that had increased
in value by $50,000 to $100,000 since the
papers were signed at Dawson.
Among the earliest of these strikes
was that on Hunker. Several among
the men who were forced to go down
the river In th~ fall for lack of provis
ions held claims on this creek which
they valued at from $1000 to $suoo. The
strike wna made before communica
tion had been re-established by the ice
on the river. No sooner had tlie first
dog team reached Dawson from Circle
City giving the sign that travel was
possible than a race was on to reach
these men for the purpos - of buying
their property before they became
aware of Its value. SeveraJ small for
tunes were made in a few days in this
way.
Then came the strike on Bear Creek
and after it on Dominion and on Sul
phur and other creeks. Many claim?
on th -se creeka had been sent out under
options that v.lued them at $louu ..,.â 
$1500. Their values suddenly ran up
in Dawson along a scale from $10,000
to $100,000, and messenger were sent
scurrying out over the ice and snow
600 miles to Dyea with instructions to
get into telegraphic communication as
quickly as possible with the agent %vho
held the authority to sell and to with
draw them from the market at the
price previously given.
Dawson has been literally isolated all
winter. While individuals started "out"
at comparatively frequent intervals no
one came in. What was going on In
the world outside was only to be
guessed at. The ft*-st mail from the
outside reached Dawson on February
28, and it was the end of the first week
in March before it was distributed.
This brought money to many and in
telligence to all of the lively Interest
th~t was felt by the people in "the
States" concerning the Klondike and
this again quickened activities.
It Is expected with the clean-up and
the arrival of t*o great army of peo
ple now on the way that this summer
will see in Dawson the liveliest mining
camp that has ever been planted on the
earth. I think that there must be 15 000
people on the trail. On the lakes they
were marching in single file over the
truil as far as the eye could see, each
with his outfit on his sled and nearly
all running with sail set before a fa
vorable wind. It was a most remarka
ble sight.
The clean-up will be retarded some
what by the scarcity of nails necessary
for he making of sluice boxes A
neighbor of mine sold for $5 the right
to draw out and carry away the nails
he had driven in the walls of his cabin
for the purpose of hanging up his
clothes and other things. Of course
there will be no gold lost on account
of the scarcity of nails, but the first
boat may not carry down the river as
much as it otherwise would. How
ever, another and still better reason
for their not doing so will lie in the
fact that very much of the gold will
be held for reinvestment in the mines.
The detailed report of the output of
the mines which follows is based, as
stateJ, upon the very best information
obtainable from a personal canvass of
all the creeks and Is placed conserva
tively upon this information. The new
regulations which require a tax of 20 per
cent of an output above $500 a week
may materially interfere with the
wash-up. If it is to be enforced very
many of the claim owners say they
will only wash up enough each year
to come within the limit for the year â
that is $26,000. Major Walsh, the new
executive of the territory, whom I in
terviewed at Lake Bennett, declares
that it is the law and he m.ist see that
it Is carried into effect. It will have a
very demoralizing effect to say the
least upon the mlninT interests of the
whole territory.
There is a strong tendency among
American miners to go down across
the line into An erican territory and
the last months of the winter saw
stampedes numbering hundreds of men
toward Mission Creek, American Creek,
Charley Creek and others, all on the
American side, as well as to the creeks
about Circle City and even further
down.
To put an estimate on the output of
! the Yukon country there must be added
to this about $1,000,000 coming from the
; mines on the American side of the line.

SKOOKUM GULCH.
Big and Little Skookum Gulches, which come
into Bonanza Creek a little below the mouth
of El Dorado Creek, are extremely rich. ThÂ«
knoll or rounded hill that separates the two
Is found to be rich to Its very summit and the
entire hill Is located, there being thirteen tiers
of bÂ»>nch claims. One hundred men are em
ployed on the hill and In the gulches and a
careful estimate of the output places the total
at not less than $1,000,000.
DOMINION CREEK.
Total estimated output, $150,000. This creek
Is in the Indian Hiver division and is a branch
of Sulphur Creek. It heads up In the same
hills where Bonanza and El Dorado have their
source, though on the ether side of the divide.
The creek is scarcely out of the prospecting
period and has few large dumps, although
shafts are being: sunk at near intervals over
ten miles of its length. There are two Discov
ery locations four and a half miles apart, and
some confusion in locating between these h;i.s
resulted. The following are the largest dumps
on the creek:

UNJUST FREIGHT RATES.
Manufacturers Protest Against Dis-
crimination Between East
and West.
The Manufacturers' and Producers' As
sociation has decided to send to its mem- ;
bers a statement showing the unfair dis
crimination of the railroads in the matter
of freight rates between this city and
cities of the East. The matter was taken
up a long time ago, but nothing wns marie
public, on account of some of the directors
fearing that the railroad nun would take
offense and make the conditions harder
if the wrong should be presented to the
puolic. However, a committee was set to
work to compile data upon the subject,
and the table produced is very Interesting
for the most of the community. It shows
In a hundred places how the manufacturer
of the West Is obliged to compete with
his brother of the East on decidedly un
equal conditions. The jobber and manu
facturer of Chicago and New York can
send products and goods to this coast all
the way from 10 cents to $6 per hundred
pounds cheaper. For example, the rate
on agricultural implements in carload lots
from San Francisco to Chicago is $3 40 a ;
hundred pounds, while from Chicago to ;
San Francisco the charge is $2 40. Burlap
bags from San Francisco to New York
cost $1 60 a hundred pounds in loss than
carload lots; from New York to San Fran
cisco the cost is only $1. Pickled fish from
San Francisco to New York is $2 10: from
New York to San Francisco it is $1. Wine
to Chicago from California is $2 In less
than carload lots, while from Chicago to
California it is only $1 35.
And so It runs through all the necessi
ties and luxuries that are moved from
place to place in the ordinary commerce
of communities. In the hope of getting ;
some relief and changes on these rates, i
the association had one of its mem- I
bers go to Monterey to the last conven
tion of railroad men, but the facts and
figures and the request for more justice |
and loss rate were pigeonholed with a
calmness that was very discouraging to
the petitioners. When this lack of action
was reported to the association some of
the directors expressed the fear that to
give the figures to the public and show
how hard the discrimination falls on all
would only excite the ill-will of the rail
road people and cause the latter to make I
the burden even harder. This sentiment '
did not prevail, for the majority of the i
directors thought that their fellow-mem
bers should be made aware of the facts.
Hence, the table was prepared, and yes
terday over 700 copies, together with a
letter of explanation from the committee. I
were Pent out While some question the
wisdom of this action, it is safe to say
that all are of the opinion that the pub
licity of the discrimination will not be \
productive of any good, at least for some ,
time to come. It is generally understood !
among the directors of the association
that if the Southern Pacific Company
were the only line to be petitioned there
would be some ground for hope, but this ;
company is only a part of the great rail- ,
road combine, and the Eastern roads '
seem to have no interest in the welfare
of this State as against that of the East
ern States.

MENACE TO THE HARBOR.
Her Water-Front Approaches May
BÂ« Controlled by Â« Private
Corporation.
The petition of the Oakland Water
Front Company to the Secretary of War.
asking for the relocation and moving of
the pierhead lines in Oakland harbor,
brought about the first clash between
that corporation and the city of Oakland,
â¢which is violently opposed to the former"s
petition as was Bet forth In numberless
documents of legal verbiage, that were
read and filed yesterday at the meeting;
of the two opposing factions.
The meeting was held in the office of
Major Heuer, chief of l'nit--d States en
gineers, in the Flood building at 10 o'clock
sharp. Colonel Charies It. Suter, of the
corps of United States engineers, pre
sided, and the various documents submit
ted were read by Major C. K. G. B. I 'avis,
of the corps of United States engineers.
The city of Oakland was represented by
the Mayor, the Board of Trade and the
Merchants' Exchange, while the Attorney
General was present, as were also ihose
favorable consideration of
the petition by the Secretary of War.
The meeting was the result of the fol
lowing petition, which was liled in the of
fice of the corps of United States engi
neers February 4.
To the Hon. Russell A. Alger, Secretary of
War: We, the undersigned snip owners, cap- I
tains and masters, engaged in shipping upon j
the I'aelric Coast, and in the bay of San Fran
cisco, and in the harbor of Oakland, respect
fully represent that the interest of shipping
and commerce, present and prospective, re
quire that the pierhead lines In Oakland har
bor, in the State of California, be relocated
and movedâ north line northward and the
south line southward â until said pierhead lines
shall Jail uiK)ii and become conlncident with
the limits of public ownership, and butt
against and Join lines of private ownership,
and so Insure to commerce the fullest possible
width to .said harbor by nature and public
ownership.
By the order of Brigadier Wilson this
petition was referred to Colonel Suter,
and he was instructed to have a public
bearing of it, at which any and all parties,
including J. E. Runcier, U. S. A., retired,
but now practicing law in San Francisco,
were to be present. The petition was
sigrr.ed by forty-three persons Interested
in the Water Front Company and the
shipping of Oakland harbor.
In Opposition to this petition there was
filed <.-.._â  from the Board of Trade of
Oakland, by its president, James R. Tay
lor. It, was as follows: ;
Whereas, A petition has been filed and Is
now pending before the Corps of Engineers, !
Eeeking to have moved landward pierhead lines
In Oakland harbor, as established about live
years ago by the Federal â  . â  eminent, the j
effect of which change would be to put new
pierhead lines and all wharves and landings
solely upon land claimed by the Oakland Water j
Front Company, leaving no free water front '
or landing place inder the control of the pub
lic, as Is now the case under the decision of
the Supreme Court of California as it now
stands;
Resolved, That this body views the proposed
change with great alarm as being against the
public interest, against the growth of Oakland
against the rights of the city and of the whole
public; and this body does strongly protest
againet any change of the pierhead lines, the
effect of which would be to limit the wharves,
docks, piers and landing dominion, now under
control of the city water front, and to take
them out of the hands of the public and put
them into the hands of individuals, or a private
corporation organized for profit.
And this body protests .tL-.iinst any change
of harbor lines, the effect of which would be
to diminish the area of the water front now
under the control of the public.
The petitionof the Merchants' Exchange
against the Oakland Water Front Com
pany's petition was similar to that of
the Board of Trad.-, with this addition:
That our representatives in Con
gress i.Â». an 1 they are herebj requested, to use
all honest meani to prevent the culmination of
this dlabolii al ;r- ,-,j c o f
this cli â â¢ of valuah!
The brief of thf> Attorney Ccn.r ' pre
pared and submitted in I jras a
lengthy one, and was to the effeel tha it
was both Inadvisable for the beat inter
ests of the city of Oakland, as well as In
consistent with the finding of the Su
preme Court of the State for the pier
head lines to be m ved.
One of the strongest and most forcible
petitions filed was the one of the city of
ficials nf Oakland. It set torth that the
changing <>f the pierhead lines would be
of great injury to the United States and
the State. To the United States in this
that if the pierhead lines, at which ships'
may now ue in 20 feet of water, is re
ceded to the shore line, which is bare >f
water at low tide, deep water for ships
must be made at the new line, necessarily
at the expense of the Government.
To retire pierhead lines Is to efface the
present harbor, which must be restored
hy dredging to tho depth of 20 feet. The
effect of the change would be not only to
water frontage to the owners of
bore line but to force the Govern
to make a harbor for their accom
modation.
It would take from the State a large
area devoted to the erection of wharves
â¢her advantages to commerce now
â¢ the control and dominion of the
it would injure the city. In that
i" w uld shut up all avenues of com
mer< â¢â  i f the city by giving them to a pri
vate corporation, at whose mercy would
de "f the city and all tho water
front approaches. It would work injury
â  harbor, in thnt the tidal flow
would be sluggish and not sufficient to
this portion of tho estuary, If the
width is Increased. The petition further
sets forth that the pierhead linos have
â i â '. onca by the Government
thai they have no right to change
without some good and sufficient
reason.
It Is said that the, Water Front Com- !
pany proposes to divide its property up
Into lots and dispose of them, and "it la
also insinuated that the- nave intimated
to tho Government their willingness to
give the Government certain water front
property if their petition is lavorably
considered.
The papers in the case will be forward
ed to the Secretary of War for his action
in the matter. There will be another
meeting of the two factions on Thursday i
morning, but it will be a private one I
PLANNING TO INCORPORATE.
The San Francisco Presbytery Con
siders a Proposition to Become

The San Francisco Presbytery met yes
terday and decided to notify its members
that the next regular meeting would be
devoted principally to perfecting plans I
for Incorporating the body into a legal

a plan is that the presbytery can hold

SOME OF THE HORRORS OF WAR.
Sufferings Congress Seems Determined to Inflict Upon Certain Citizens.
OUR citizens, or those of them who
by nature or by cultivation have ac
quired a thirst that only the product
of barley and hops properly liquefied
can satisfy, are about to experience one
of the first horrors of war.
The price of beer Is going up.
Mr. Dingley and some more patriots at
Washington are engaged in formulating
a new tariff to meet the extraordinary
demands for revenue to prosecute the
coming conflict with the tamale manu
facturers, and with an utter disregard
for the sufferings of our own people they
have already agreed to increase the tax
on beer from $1 to $2 per barrel.
When this startling bit of Information
was fla-shtxl across the continent It wrung
large drops of amber colored anguish
from the hearts of thousands. The very
thought of the calamity about to befall
them created a thirst in every throat
magnificent in its proportions.
But the keenest sufferers were the
brewers. Before the news was twenty
four hours old notices were out tor a
ducted at Union Square Hall. At the last
meeting of the presbytery It was decided
i.i temporarily suspend the mission. Mr.
Russel In his letter t- Â» I <l of the hardships
ncountered while in charge of t!v>
school. He said be was twice obliged to
call the protection of the police to de
fend himself and property against at
tacks made by parties of rowdies that
were led to do him and his work mis
chief owing to religious prejudices.
The ministers deplored the fact that
they were obliged to close the mission
owing to the withdrawal of Mr. Russell I
to other fields of work, but promised that '
it would be opened again as soon as the
necessary arrangements could be made \
to conduct and Bupport It.
An overture to the General Assembly \
recommending that an amendment be
to the rules governing the church
giving the church session control of the
church property was adopted.

GIANT SEAWEEDS HIS TOPIC.
Professor Setchell of Berkeley De

the Subject.
Professor William A. Setcneu of Berke- |

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 19, 1898.
meeting of the Brewers' Protective Asso
ciation at their rooms in the Flood
building, and there for the past three
days the matter has been discussed In
all its bearings behind closed doors. The
first meeting was Held on Friday. Sec
retary Rudolph Mohr, whose breadth of
beam is somewhat in excess of his depth
of hold, was on picket duty to guard
against any attempt on the part of out
siders to invade the camp, and every
member took solemn oath on a brass
spigot and a hiing starter not to reveal
the proceeding". Then, after tossing off
the contents of a barrel of extra pale,
thoughtfully provided by one of their
number, the twenty members present got
down to discussing the proposed action.

HIE COOKS
OF KLAMATH.
Denial of Their Request
to Modify the Re
straining Order.
Judge Morrow Said That Force
of Arms Gave No
Rights.
They "Were Trespassers Upon tho
Sawmill Property and Must
Remain on tho Outsldo.
Vnlted States Circuit judge Morrow
yesterday rendered his decision in the
matter of the application of the KltTjaath
River Lumber and Improvement Com
pany to so modify the restraining order
heretofore issued against them as to .al
low the Klamath people to retake posses
sion of the property Including the mill
and railway now being held and operated
by the lc.-s es, the Pokegama Sugar Pine
Lumber Company. The court denied me
application in an oral decision, which
gave the attorneys making the applica
tion very little comfort.
The court gave a very clear resume of
the history of the case from the time the
sawmill property was leased from the
Cooks by HervÂ«y Lindley and his asso
ciates of the I'okegama Company. The
lessees had expended $75,000 and more in
extending the railway, repairing the mill
and In otherwise improving the property.
They had also made a cut of logs pre
paratory to beginning this season's work.
They were just ready to make their
spring drive and start the mill when
some capitalists came out from the East
and offered the Cooks a good figure for
the property for its purchase outright if
they could get immediate possession.
As the property was leased immediate
possession was out of the question, but
the Cooks went down one night with a
gang of armed men an- forcibly took
possession of the mill and the railroad
and forcibly drove out tho employes of
the Pokegama Company. The United
States Marshal thereafter proceeded to
the scene to Berve the restraining order
issued by the United States t'ircuit Court,
but he was resisted by the Cooks and
their employes, and it was only until after
0 large number of them had been arrest
ed for contempt of court that they allow
ed the law iii 'i take its course.
Judge Morrow dwelt particularly and
emphatically upon the fact that the
Klamath people had not denied the alle
gation that the reason for their having
forcibly taken possession of the property
was that they had a favorable opportu
nity to sell it, provided they could give
the purchasers immediate possession.
Judge Morrow held yesterday that the
Klamath people had gained no rights
whatever in that contention, because they
went in upon the property with a gang
of armed men, and that they therefore
could not acquire any possessory rights
whatever by means of violence and force
of arms. They were simply trespassers
on the property, and the court could not
give them possession under the circum
stances.
It is expected that Judge Morrow will
pass upon the contempt cases In a day
or two. ____^_____^__
The City Wins the Case.
Judge Dainperfield yesterday rendered
judgment In favor of the city and coun
ty in the suit brought by John M. Mc-
Kay and K. V. Dey, as trustees under
the will of the late Theresa Fair, to re
cover $28,445, paid as taxes under pro
test.

Mrs. Biadley Loses Her Suit.
Mrs. Elizabeth P. Bradley, who was
formerly employed as a teacher of free
hand drawing In the Polytechnic High
School, has lost her suit against the
Board of Education. The position occu
pied by her was recently declared vacant,
and she brought mandamus proceedings
grocerymep, deserted music halls and
empty "growlers." while many plans of
greater or less feasibility have been pre
sented for relieving the threatened dis
aster. It is slated that one plan, which
has received favorable consideration, em
braces a new process of brew, whereby
the succulent steam when drawn into the
generous schooner will dissolve Itself in
to one mass of airy foam, instead of
leaving an inch or so of liauid In the bot
tom of the glass as now. Then there are
others, but most of them have been dis
carded ;is Impracticable.
Already word has reached the saloon
men of the contemplated action of the
brewers, and great is the consternation
thereat. Some of them have already be
gun to substitute glasses of less dimen
sions than they formerly served, and in
a short time we may expect to see a
black line drawn through the familiar V
that ornaments the windows of most of
m:v corner emporiums, and underneath
the less alluring X. signifying the price
list fif the staple dispensed therein.
Meanwhile Congress Is going right

SEVEN HOmiS A DAY NOW.
Federal Employes Must Work Sinty
Minutes Longer Than For
merly.
The edict har- grohe forth thnt hereafter
all employes of the Federal Government
will have to perform s rven hours' labor
for their i-siy. This docs not mer.n that
they can be in attendance at their re-
Bpectlve departments for this time, but
they must work. Secretary C. N. Bliss
of the Department of the Interior has so
ordered, and he must he obeyed. In the
past employes were in the habit of get
ting to work at a o'clock In the morning,
taking an hour for their noonday lunch
and .iiuitting at 4 o'clock, making- a day
of six hours. In the recent circular re
ceived by Surveyor-GeUeral Gleaves from
Secretary ISliss the latter calls attention
to the act of March 16 Of this year, which
em; hasises the fact that hereafter the
lie.-ids of all departments shall require
not less than seven hours' labor of their
employes, without additional compensa
tion.
The act also specifies that each em
ploye is entitled to at least thirty days'
vacation every year on full pay. While in
the p.ist it was understood that they
could gel .-i vacati ( about a month
s-np it was more a matter of discretion'
with the heads of the departments than
law. In some of the departments the en
forcement of the new law will be the
metros of getting from six to forty hours
a week more work out of the office forces
In a number of the Federal offices of this
city there is a disposition to get in the
extra, time before 4 o'clock In the day
so as to :,'et away early. This is accom
plished by starting in work a little aheac.
of time and taking less time for lunch.
LINDEN HAD TO APOLOGIZE.
Because a Reporter Tried to Catch a
Robber He Was Accused
of Robbery.
John Linden, 433 Jersey street, imbibed
too much liquor Sunday night, and while
wending his devious way home at an
early hour yesterday morning he was
knocked down and robbed of $20 and his
' watch and chain on Howard street near
! Seventh. A reporter saw the robber run
ning away and save chase, but was un
able to overtake him. He returned to
. where he had seen Linden and found him
lying in a doorway. He roused him un
and Linden accused him of being the rob
; her. The reporter indignantly denied the
! charge and felt so angry about it that he
compelled Linden to accompany him to
' the Southern police station, where lin
â¢ den had to apologize.

The tug Vigilant has resumed duty with
the fleet of J. D. Spreckels & Bros. Com
pany. In the negotiations conducted by
John D. Spreckels, representing the com
pany owning the tugs, and Lieutenant R.
F. Lopez, i_. S. N., representing the com
mandant at Mare Island Navy-yard, there
was a misunderstanding regarding the
price to be paid for the Vigilant. Mr.
Lopez reported the price to be $55,000,
whereas Mr. Sprecke'^ fixed the h'tj
ure at $60,000. When it came time
to close the deal and surrender the prop
erty to the Government the variance was
noted. Mr. Spreckels declined to sell the
tug for less than $60,000, and the repre
sentatives of the navy declined to pay
more than $55,000, hence the sale was de
clared ; ft.
The tugs Fearless and Active have been
secured by the Government. There was
no question between the negotiating par
ties as to the price designated; hence the
bargain was closed. Plans for convert
ing the tu;;.s Into war vessels have been
('.rawii and submitted to the Navy Depart
ment for approval. As soon as the rec
ominem.atinns are approved at Washing
ton the union Iron Works will make the
necessary changes.

Is understood that the Fearless and Act
ive will be supplied with quick-iiring six
pounders of the Hotchkiss type. The tug
Relief, belonging to the Sprecke'.s fleeet,
is now on duty in the Columbia River.
The owners do not see their way clear to
sell the tug. as towing contracts requir
ing the service of the Relief had been
made before the Government began to
look around for naval re-enforcement.
In the event of great emergency the
Government could exercise arbitrary au
thority and place the vessel in such "serv
ice as the Navy Department should indi
cate. An emergency of this character is
not likely to arise on the Pacific, but if
it should cfrne the owners of the Relief
would subordinate their private interests
to the public service.
AN ARTIST
OF ABILITY
A. V. Anderson Hopes for
Recognition of His
Efforts.
Has Recently Finished an Historical
Sketch Which Deserves
Prominence.
A. V. Anderson, living at 1343 Vallejo
street, has recently completed a painting
Sxl2 feet in size which proves him to be
an artist of considerable ability. The ar
tist started his work early last Novem
ber, and great care '.s shown in the entire
work, which represents the landing of
Swedes at Partys Point, Pennsylvania, in
1638. The idea was taken entirely from
readings of history.
In the foreground the travelers are
Biandlng with uncovered heads, relig
iously thanking the Supreme Being for a
safe voyage. Others are bartering- with
the Indians, and on a distant point two
half clad savages sand. seemingly won
dering at the vessels which lie at anchor
off the reef in the distance. All are
dressed in ancient garb worn by their
people at that date, and the entire work
of art has been produced true to nature.
In the center of the group a little child
stands clinging to his mother's skirts,
looking in a frightened mariner at the
savages near by. The ships which have
carried the travelers to their journey's
end are Hying the Swedish Hag, and a
boat with the last on board can be seen
coining in the distance. The foreground,
sky, water, light and shade blend in per
fect harmony.
As many artists before him. Anderson
is a poor m;!:i and is depending on this
last effort to bring him before the eyes
of the critical world, and he Is confident
of recognition.
The Lamp Exploded.
William Ahem, a painter living at 546
Fourth street, was working at a building
on Welch street, between Fifth and
Sixth, yesterday afternoon when the
gasoline '.amp used by him exploded and
his face and hands were burned. He was
taken to the Receiving Hospital, where
Dr. Bunnell attended to his injuries.
May Lose His Hand.
Joseph Harry, who was employed on a
ranch in San Benito County, went out
Bhooting Sunday and, in getting over a
wire fence, the rifle he was carrying acci
dentally exploded and the bullet went
through his right hand. He called at the
Receiving Hospital yesterday and Dr.
Wall fears that the hand will have to be
amputated. Barry's parenta live at 542
Joost street.
STREET GRADES OUT OF GEAR.
The Supervisors Held Blameless for
the Bad Condition of Affairs.
The grade on the crossing of Ashbury
and Seventeenth streets has given the
property owners, or such of them as hold
small lots, ouite a deal of trouble. The
running of Seventh street throufih the
summit of the hill toward the park and
ocean has been one of the long cherished
hopes of the owners of property In this
section. To accomplish this much de
sirable end considerable money has been
expended in cutting Seventeenth street at
the crown of the hill to a passable grade.
While this is being done Ashbury street
is left In its virgin condition without any
attempt being made to conform to grade.
There are two elements to be reconciled
before the desired improvements are
made, one of which is the smaller ho'a
ers who favor improvement, and the
other the larger holders who are opposed
to it on the ground of expense.
The former class have formed an im
provement club known as the "New Park
Lane Tract and Seventeen ..h-street Im
provement Club." The members of this
club have appeared before the Super
visors and presented its grievance. It
asked for street grades to be established
and proper sewers put down. The Super
visors accorded the committee a patient
hearing and have done everything in 'he
power of the board to improve the dis
trict and make it both healthful and de
sirable to the many residents. Therefore
the club feels indebted to the Supervisors
for whatever benefits have been accorded
to this section.

Board.
When the Board shall recommend any
work to be done on a street intersec
tion or crossing, where the streets do
not intersect each other at right angles,
it shall in each such case determine
what lots in the blocks adjacent to such
intersection or cro. ing will Le benefit
ed by said work, and shall cause a
map to be made on which shall bÂ©
delineated the lots so to be benefited.
Such map shall be transmitted to the
Supervisors with said recommenda

ing such district, a majority of the
owners of the land within said district

that such objections are sufficient to
prevent a recommendation of the im
provement, it shall pass a resolution to
that effect, and no further proceedings
shall be had under said petition. If
no objections have been filed, or if the
Board shall determine that the objec
tions filed are insufficient, It may pass
a resolution recommending to the Su

fied as affected by said improvement
will be benefited to the extent of tha
expense of said improvement.

ACQUISITION OF PUBLIC UTIL
ITIES.
It is hereby declared to be the pur
pose and intention of the people of the
City and County that its public utilities
shall be gradually acquired and ulti
mately owned by the City and County.
To this end it is hereby ordained:
SECTION 1. Within one year from
the date upon which this Charter shall
go into effect, and at least every twa
years thereafter until the object ex
pressed in this provision Bhall have
been fully attained, the Supervisors
must procure through the City Engi
neer plans and estimates of the actual
cost of the original construction and
completion by the City and County of
water works, gas works, electric light
works, steam, water or electric power
works, telephone lines, street railroads
and such other public utilities as tho
Supervisors or the people by petition to
the Board may designate.
In securing estimates of the original
cost of the construction and completion
of water works by the City and County,
the Supervisors must procure and place
on file plans and estimates of the cost
of obtaining from all of the several
available sources a sufficient and per
manent supply of good, pure water for
the City and County, in order that
propositions for the acquisition, con
struction and completion thereof, and
the incurring of municipal indebtedness
therefor, may be submitted to the elec
tors of the City and County as herein
after set forth.
Sec. 2. After such plans and esti
mates shall have been procured and
filed, the Supervisors shall, at as early
a date as they may deem for the best
: interests of the City and County, enter
' into negotiations for the permanent ac
! quisition by the City and County, by
' original construction, condemnation or
i purchase of Buch or any of said
! public utilities as they may regard
I most important to the City and County
1 to be first acquired, and to formulate
! and submit to the electors of the City
I and County, at a special election, prop
! osltions for the permanent acquisition
and ownership thereof.
Before submitting propositions to
the electors for the acquisition by orlg
' inal construction or condemnation, of
| public utilities, the Supervisors must
! solicit and consider offers for the sale
to the City and County of existing util
ities in order that the electors shall
i have the benefit of acquiring the same
i at the lowest possible cost thereof.
Sec. 3. When a petition or petitions
signed by electors of the City and
' County equal In number to fifteen per
centum of all the votes cast at the last
preceding general election shall be pre
i sented to the Supervisors, setting forth
that the signers thereof favor the ac
quisition by the City and County of any
! public utility, and requesting the
Board to prepare for submission to tho
electors of the City and County, as
i hereinafter provided, a proposition for
j the acquisition of such utility, it shall
I be the duty of the Board to immediate
i ly take such steps or to enter into such
I negotiations as will enable It to formu
| late such a proposition for submission
i to the electors as aforesaid. Such prop
: ositton shall be so formulated and com.
! pleted within six months from the data
jof the filing of such petition. The Clerk
I of the Supervisors must, immediately
i upon the filing of the aforesaid petition
or petitions, after examining and veri
fying the signatures thereto, transmit
an authenticated copy thereof, without
the signature?, to the Board of Election
Commissioners, and another such copy
to the Mayor, together with a certifi
cate that the required number of signa
tures are appended to the original. ThÂ©
Mayor shall also have the right to for
mulate and submit to the electors &
separate proposition from that formu
lated by the Supervisors for the acqui
sition of the utility named in said peti
tion. At the next municipal election af
ter the formulation of such proposi
tions by the Supervisors and the May
or, the Board of Election Commission
ers shall submit to the electors the two
alternative propositions. The proposi
tion receiving a majority of the votes
caÃt thereon shall be adopted; but in
case the votes cast in favor of bothpropositions shall not exceed one-half
the total number of votes cast thereon,
both propositions shall be deemed re
jected.
Nothing In this section shall be so
construed as to prohibit the Superris
ora from responding to the aforesaid
petition of the electors requesting the
acquisition of any public utility by pro
ceeding at once, without the submission
of propositions to the electors as afore
said, to pass an ordinance declaring its
determination to acquire the same aiÂ»
provided in Bectlon six of this Article ]
and from proceeding thereafter to ac
quire the same In the manner herein
after provid
Sec. 4. In case the cost of any public
utility sought to be acquired under the
provisions of this Article, can be paid
out of the annual revenues of the City
und County, in addition to the other
necessary expenditures thereof, it shall
be lawful to acquire the same by a ma
jority vote of the electors voting there
on at any BpÂ» lal election. In submit
ting propositions to the electors for
such acquisition the Supervisors shall
specify in such proposition the cost of
the public utility, the proposed method
and manner of payment therefor, and
submit to the electors the question
whether the same shall be acquired
upon such terms.
In case, however, the cost of such
public utility sought to be acquired
under the provisions of this Article
shall so tar exceed the annual revenues
of the City and County, in addition to
the other necessary expenditures there
of, as to render it necessary to incur a
municipal bonded indebtedness for such
purpose, then the Supervisors, in sub
mitting propositions to the electors for
the acquisition thereof, shall specify
therein the amount of the proposed ;
bonded Indebtedness, the rate of inter
est thereon, and whether such, bonded
indebtedness shall be incurred. At
â  two-thirds of the electors voting;
thereon at such election shall be neces
sary to secure such acquisition and to
w-arrant the issuance of municipal
bonds therefor, as hereinafter set forth.
Sec. 5. When the electors by vote
shall have determined, as hereinbefore
set forth, to acquire any public utility,
such action on the part of the electors
shall be equivalent to the passing of
the ordinance by the Supervisors de
daring such determination as set forth
in section six of this Article, and the
Supervisors shall proceed without de
lay to pass an ordinance railing a j
Bpeci&l election as required by section |
seven of this Article.
Sec. 6. When the Supervisors shall de
termine that the public interest or ne
cessity demands the acquisition, con
struction or completion of any public
utility, the c>st of which will be too
great to bepaid out of the ordinary an
nual income and revenue of the City and
County, the Supervisors shall, by or
dinance, specifically declare such de- \
termination, and shall publish the same

have determined to acquire any public
utility, the Supervisors by ordinance
shall call a special election, at which
shrill be'submitted to the electors the
proposition of acquiring such public
utility, and of incurring a debt for the
acquisition of the same as set forth in
such ordinance. No question other
than the acquisition of such utility and
the incurring of tho indebtedness
therefor shall be submitted at such ',
election.
Pec 8. The ordinnnce calling such
special election shall recite the objects
and purposes for which the indebted
ness is proposed to be incurred, the es
timated cost of the prt-pnsed public
utility, the necessity for the acquisition
of the same, and that bonds of the City

of the cost of the same as in such or
dinance set forth (if the proposition be

shall be held, the manner of holding

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, April IS.â There was buying of
etocks by professionals in the first hour this
morning, which raised the price* of most of
the limited number of stocks traded in a point
or over. After midday, traders sold again,
wiping out the early advances. The day's
changes are insignificant and are mixed be
tween gains and losses. The amount of busi
ness done was almost the smallest In the his
tory of the Exchange, and a large proportion
of the small total was - made up of Tobacco.
This stock continued to reflect the contest be
tween Insiders and shorts and the Indications
all went to show that the shorts were In dis
tress. After falling off more than a point the
stock mounted in an eccentric way six points,
and closed a point below the best. The buy
ing of the morning, which advanced the gen
eral list, was apparently based on the pre
sumption that the differences at Washington
on the Cuban question added to the chances
Of a peaceful solution by delaying war. There
were silent advances in the price of Ameri
cans in London before the opening here, which
helped on the rise.
The selllnc was due to the action of the
House of Representatives in receding from its
resolution and concurring in the Senate reso
lution after eliminating the Independence of
the Cuban Republic. The feature Is the small
floating supply of stocks. This makes an Ideal
market for professional operators on account
of the ease with which prices move. But It is
evident that the present market Is buttressed
with buying: orders below the present level
of price*. Any considerable advance is met
with large selling to realize. It Is this that
produces the almost unyielding steadiness of
the market. A one point turn seems to be
about the utmost that . the professional room
traders are. able to accomplish.
The gold received by Saturday's steamers
still further fortified the cash reserves of the
banks and engagements announced for to-day
were over 000. 000, besides $1,000,000 encaged
late on Saturday. The money market how
ever, showed little disposition to yield al
though call money was loaned on the Stock
Exchange at 2 per cent. Banks and trust com
panies generally hold out for 4 per cent for call
money and 6 per cent for time money The
movement of funds to the interior continues
but it is regarded as very significant that out-
Bide banks are- beginning to loan money here
The expectation of a Government loan with
out doubt influences the banks to hold their
reserves, and the marked weakness of Govern
ment bonds to-day was taken as indicating the
approach of a new bond issue.
The market for railroad bonds was almost
absolutely stagnant to-day, and there were
no changes of significance In prices. Total
sales. J550.000. â â â¢â 'â  ..
United States new 4s declined 1*;. the old 4s
registered Hi. the old 4s coupon 1 and the 6s Â«

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. April 18.â A rather easy ferline
was noticeable at the opening of wheat. With
the exception of California almost the entire
country reported crop prospects as bright, with
the weather perfect for farming operations.
Prospective buyers were also held tn check for
the time being by the fact that Liverpool, al
though opening at a good advance, had lost
about all of it before trading commenced here.
But the Incipient weakness gavo way to
strength almost before the market got under
way. The big bull factor of laet week, the
foreign demand for American grain, was again
very much In evidence, it being stated that
everything offered or wheat, corn, rye and oats
was accepted In the Continental markets at
good prices. This evidence of determination
on the part of the foreigners to get all the
grain possible before the actual outbreak ol
expected hostilities resulted in a very general
buying movement, In which St. Louis short*
were quite prominent, and which continued
for half an hour. Offerings were small and In
scattered lots, prices advanced steadily. July
opened at 86%Â®MHc, or a shade under Satur
day's closing piice. Before selling became
hravy enough to cause a turn the market had
advanced to 87*ic, the high price of the day.
Realizing on the advance then became quite
heavy, a decline to &6%c resulting. Before
11:30 July had dropped to BGV4c The price of
July at one time in the afternoon fell as low
as SO<c. It recovered to S6%c, where it closed.
Very little was done either in May or the other
futures.
Corn was strong early In sympathy with
wheat. Foreign demand was heavy. The mar
ket was strong to the close, July closing %c
higher.
Oats followed corn to some extent, ruling firm
all day. The best prices were ruling at the
close. July closed %c higher.
Provisions were exceptionally dull and prices
durum- most of the session were practically at
a standstill. Only a narrow trade was done.
At the close July pork was unchanged, July
lard 2V>c lower and July ribs 2%c higher. -^7..

COFFEEâ The circular of C. H. liickford I
gives the receipts at this port thus far this
year at 53.855 bags, against 48,705 during the
same time in 1897. The sales from first hands
were. 31,299 bags, against 30,850. The stock on
hand April 1 was 27, 2 bags, against 15.293. The
world's visible supoly April 1 was 174,766 bags,
[ against 4.151.529 April 1, 1897. The circular !
| says: "Since the date of our last circular, the
26th ult., sentiment has undergone a radical
change in favor of this article, especially so '
among buyers, who "were almost universally ;
carrying scant supplies.
"Th# immediate cause of this sudden turn i
of feeling has been the serious tension between \
the Governments of the United States and
Spain with reference to Cuba, leading to pro- i
posals by Congress providing for funds in
event of actual hostilities â among others being
' the renewal of port duties on Coffee and i
I Teaâ the daily contingency that these reso- |
â  lutions in part or whole might become law.
"While among both buyers and sellers there
has been and is much divergence of opinion as I
to the ultimate outcome of the present diplo- :
matic difficulties the net result has been a ;
heavy business at improving figures for all ex- ;
j cept the highest . price descriptions, the latter
being neglected In favor of those qualities
thought likely to be most affected by a tariff
renewal.
"The market has been quite irregular, sway
ing according to the news of the day. Local
i conditions of supply and demand have also
played their part. While some Coffees, notably
current unwashed Salvadors, have advanced
fully 1 cent, others have moved but a fraction
or have not changed at all.

vised to this writing.

DEMOCRATS
ENGAGE IN A
FIST FIGHT
Campaign Committee
Rooms the Scene of
the Encounter.
Larry Buckley and Pat
rick Hayes Were the
Combatants.
Row Over the Possession of
District Enrollment
Records.
BUT LITTLE BLOOD SHED.
Lively Time* Are Expected at To-
Morrow'a Election in thÂ« 28th
Assembly District.
The serenity that has thus far marked
the proceedings of the Haraey Democrats
in preparing for district, enrollment was
marred last night by a personal encoun
ter of the good old campaign variety.
The scene of the encounter was the
rooms of the campaign committee in the
Baldwin Hotel, the principals being
Larry Buckley and Patrick Hayes, both
of the Twenty-eighth Assembly District.
While no great amount of blood was
Bhed the festivities were sufficiently live
ly while they lasted to cause a stam
pede from the committee rooms to the
corridors and lobby of the hotel.
The trouble was the direct outcome of
a factional fight that is being waged in
the district named. Hayes representing
one side and Buckley the other. Both
tides turned out In force la*i week and
registered their names before the enroll
ment committee. Everything went along
in an orderly and proper manner until
the rolls were closed Saturday night. It
was then that Buckley executed his grand
coup. He took possession of the enroll
doing scored a signal vic
tory for his faction. To-morrow is the
Rxed for the election of twenty-live
delegates to serve on the general com
mittee from each district. Only those
whose names appear on ihe enrollment
s will be permitted to vote, there
fore it will be seen that Buckley's pos
u of the <.n!y existing list of en
namea In the Twenty-eighth Dis
trict becomes at once a matter of very
serioufs importance to the Hayes faction.
Thus it was tnat when the leaders of
no factions met in the rooms of the
campaign committee last night those
among the Initiated at once began to
issue war bulletins.
Hayes began hostilities by calling Buck
ley a dog, a compliment that was returned
in kind, with a few additional oral gar
nishments too emphatic for publication.
i returned to the charge, and then
Buckley, abandoning diplomacy , swung
on his opponent and knocked hirr. against
a plate-glass mirror. Hayes lashed out
with his left and sm<Â«ti Buckley under
tile eye. After that it was give and take
until .some of the less timid ones, â¢â¢in
the interest of harmony," separated the
combatants and prevented further dam
age to person and property. Buckley still
retains possession of the enrollment sheet,
' thai premises much for the inter
est attached to to-morow's election in
Senator Braunhart's stronghold.
Last night's meeting of the campaign
committee waa for the purpose of deter
mining how the election oriicers in the
various districts should be appointed. It
was agreed that the members of the cam
paign committee should be authorized to
appoint election officers.
A CLEAN BUT DILL
FARCE-COMEDY
Poor Playwriting and a Tame
Star in "Delmonico's
at Six."
Melodrama of Many Crimes at Moros
co'sâ Old Bills at ;he Other
Theaters.
"Delmonico's at Six" Is the title of a
comparatively clean and innocuous, but
very foolish little farce which was
played at the Columbia Theater last
nipht, without either justifying Its exist
ence or explaining the stellar ambitions
of Mi.=s Marie Jansen. The main id- a in
the farce is not bad A middle-aged
physician tires of the trustfulness of his
wife and the peacefulness of his fireside
and determines to relieve the monotony
by making himself out to be a regular
devil. This he accomplishes by means of
a photograph with c bogus Inscription on
It and a spurious compromising letter.
Unconsciously ho is taking in vain the
name and features of a celebrated vaude
ville actress. Bbc learns of the plot and
turns up at Delmonico's punctually on
the hour of G (as per spurious letter),
bent on vindication and comic vengeance.
There is nothing electrically novel about
the idea, but with a little of the sensa
tionaJ invention that is denied it by the
author it might be made to serve for a
half hour of harmless fun. In Its ores
ent shape "Delmonico's at Six" is two
acts of utter vacancy and one (the last)
of belated and misdirected hustle. A star
of ten times the candle power, of Miss
Jansen might twinkle in it uns< en.
It seems almost Inevitable that the
comic opera favorites <>f New York
should take to the road and the center of
the stage just so soon as their metropoli
tan vogue begins to wane. Marie Jansen
cannot sing any better than many of the
little tdrls at the Tivoli, v,ho are glad to
be alive on incomes of jig a week; her
acting is of the defunct comic opera
Bcbool â mock-heroics am) Infantile drool
She has rather a pretty face and prettier
legs. 1 mention these latter not because
I nm an especially capable scrutator of
such members, but because In their day
they have rtood for a good deal of sensa
tional praise from the New York critics
and because they are strenuously insisted
upon In this performance.
With the exception of Jessie Bradbury,
who Is exorbitantly bad as a French maid
and preposterously good !n a bit of pop
ular song; and Elice Bertram, who Is
amiably Lyceum-like In. the part of sub
sidiary heroine, and Mack Charles, who
ha-s moments of cheerfulness as a Bowery
Sandow, the company is of an undis
turbed mediocrity. g.
BALDWIN.
"A Stranger In -\'ew York" entered Its
cocond and last week to light attendance.
Ferris H^rtman and his company are put
tine the final touches on "The Purser,"
which on Monday night at the Baldwin
will he pre.^nt^d for the first time to an
AmerJcitn audience.
ALCAZAR
"The Strange Adventures of Miss Brown"
has caught on and continues all of this
week at the Alcazar. Then comes "The
Gay Parisians." with L. R. StocKwell and
Howard Scott In the cast. At to-night's
WHEN SHALL THESE" THREE MEET AGAIN?
The five-masted schooner Louis, the pilot-boat Grade S and lightship No. 70 were all in a bunch yesterday,
Captain Jordan had just been transferred from the pilot-boat to the schooner and the latter was squaring
away for port when the snapshot from which the above was drawn was taken. The Louis went from the
Sound to Collao, Peru, with a cargo of lumber, and while there Captain Hatch died. First Mate Franz brought
the schooner to Portland and from Portland to San Francisco.
performance the Alcazar's new fireproof
curtain will be formally dropped. Its
subject Is "The Garden of Love, and it
has been painted by Stevens under the
direction of the house artist, Edward
Williams. In the foreground six pairs of j
lovers in pay attire pive reason for the I
title while in the background is b senti- j
mental bit of water view, and an old I
chateau almopt veiled in the luxuriant
foliage of the water's banks.
TIVOLI.
No successor to ihe Tivoli's Jolly Easter
burlesque. "Sinbad the Sailor." has been
appointed as yet. "Sinbad" seems good
for several weeks more. To-morrow night
the Bay City Wheelmen will attend in a
body In honor of "Bob" Mitchell, who is
an old member of their organization. The
Bay City March, composed by Wheelman
A. R. C'una, will be pla>eu by the Tivoii
orchestra.
ORPHEUM.
The Orpheum retains Its excellent Hyde
comedians until Sunday afternoon, when
the new bill will be presented. The per
formance is the same this week as last,
with the exception of several new songs
and a few variations in the turns.
CALIFORNIA.
There will be a fashionable crush at the
California to-morrow night to welcome
Melba in "Traviata." On Thursday night
Rossini's "Barber of Seville" will be
sung: on Saturday nifht ".Lucia" will be
the bill.
PASSION PLAY.
Last night commenced the second week
. of the cineomatographic reproductions of
; the "Passion Play" at the Young Men's
! Auditorium. The attraction has been
; strengthened by several new colored
views in addition to the 5000 feet of mov
ing films and the two uozen slides al-
I ready shown, and Mrs. John Morrisey has
j been engaged to sing and Herr Retdor of
New York to play upon the organ. Nearly
all the local clergy have attended and ap
! proved the entertainment.
SYMPHONY.
The following Is the complete pro
gramme of the symphony concert to De
given at the Tivoii on Thursday after
noon: Overture. "Hans Helling" (Marsch
ner): Symphony No. 4 (i . Zech Jr.);
Suite. Peer Gynt (Greig); Rhapsodic No.
1 (Liszt).
CHUTES.
The wild animals and the docile little
Cuban lady are 5...i the attractions at the
.Chutes. There is some new vaudeville in
'the free theater.
MORGSCO'S.
"The Diamond Breaker," a play with
! four acts and forty crimes to the aft.
was played at Morosco'a last night. There
were seventeen people and a coal crusher
in the east. The coal crusher did re
markably well, as it was the only thing
n:i the stage that had no lines to speak,
and consequently none to forget^
The play is of the kind known as a
i "mechanical drama.'' and its plot hinges
lon a young girl by the name of Rex
AJden, whose fath< r has been murdered,
thus leaving her mother a widow. This
young lady "starts" somewht're In the
â  mountains of Pennsylvania (where the
: Inhabitants, owing to their dual occu
i pation of mining coal and stilling whisky,
I are of an uncertain and cynical tempera
j mentj and sets the ball rolling by falling
jin love with a poor but handsome in
ventor, who tells her of his passion for
j her and, incidentally, assures her that
I he is just the sort of an individual that
! can be relied on in the hour of need. She
' receives his attentions with complaisaney,
: but informs him that for the present she
i cannot think of marrying him. as she has
; a little errand to perform, namely, the
detection Of the man who murdered her
father, and who she swears shall pay
the full penalty for his dastard act.
Now this young man is not the kind
' to see his girl go on an errand by her
self, so he starts to hunt up the unknown
! desperado on his own account. When
; the plot beuins to develon itself the
! casual spectator begins to wonder if the
: hero had any sort of an idea of the Job
:he undertook when he started. The girl
I leads him all over the mountains, where
| he is robbed and shot at; through an in
sane asylum, where he is forced to scrap
â  with the entire force of brutal assistants*
: Into a coal mine, where he is first dubbed*
with a (shovel and a lead pipe, and then
i thrown down a chute leading toward the
, machinery, and finally saved from a hor
: lible death by his sweetheart, who re
covers from being choked to death and
arrives, riding on a coal car, just in time
; to slide down a pole and rescue him
In the fourth act there is more villainy
which is brought to an end by the death
of the arch fiend from an electric shock
and the demise or Imprisonment of all
his associates. The hero, heroine and all
the miner heroes and heroinettes are
made proportionately happy. The a'ctine
tits the play.
"Charity*' His Subject.
The eloquent Paullst missionary, the
Rev. EL H. Younan, will lecture in St.
Francis Church, Vallejo street and Mont
g-omery siyenue, to-morrow evening, on
"Charity." The lecture is for the benefit
of St. Vincent de Paul Society, who look
after the poor of St. Francis parish
Father Younan leaves for New York ori

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 19, 1898.
WHERE IS THE
BARK MIDAS?
Underwriters and Ship
ping Men Fear for Her
Safety.
She Was Out In the Storm That
Nearly Wrecked the Bark
Willscott.
Gold-Hunters From All Parts oT the
Union Are Engaging Passage
to Kotzebue.
It Is feared in shipping circles that the
British bark Midas, now out sixty-five
days from Nagasaki, Japan, has gone
down with all hands. Six vessels that
sailed fom the Orient the same time and
later than the Midas have arrived at
their destination, discharged their cargoes
and, In some instances, gone to sea again.
The "Willscott, that sailed eight days be
fore her, had to put in here in distress.
She was caught In a terrific storm and
dismasted, while the Puritan, which sailed
thje same day as the Midas, was also
caught in the Willscott's gale, but has
reached Portland in safety.
The following vessels made the run from
Japan to coast ports in from twenty-four
to thirty-six days. The Barmbeg left
Hlogo on February 15 and the Pass of
Lenig on February 21: the Amazone left
Yokohama on March 7 and the Nomea on
March 10, while the Mistley Hall left
Nagasaki on .February 27 and the Se
mantha on the same day. In view of these
facts, it is no wonder, then, that shipping
and insurance men are anxious about the
Midas.
The anxiously looked for tramp steamer
Venus arrived from Hongkong via Yoko
hama yesterday morning with the yellow
flag Hying. On the way to Yokohama Chief
Engineer Peter Harvey was taken sick,
and when the vessel put in at Nagasaki
he was put ashore, suffering from small
pox. During the run to San Francisco
Chief Steward Horace Brown was taken
sick, and was still confined to his room
when the vessel came to an anchor. Dra.
Hill and Rosenau ordered the Venus into
quarantine, where she will be thoroughly
fumigated, after which she will dock.
The Venus took the place of the Coptic
for this trip. The latter vessel was dis
abled in a hurricane, and had to dock at
Hongkong for repairs. It snowed during
almost the entire trip of the Venus. She
brought no passengers, but has an un
usually heavy cargo, among which is 115,
000 mats of rice.
Fred Ga-^t, a Bailor on the British bark
Bocotro, lost his life from Green-street
wharf early yesterday morning. He and
Charles Dahlgren started f"r the vessel
about 1 a. m., and while looking for the
ship's boat Gast stumbled over some
lumber and fell overboard. In his fall he
must have struck the raft of piles that is
lying In the slip between Green and
Vallejo streets and sunk. His remains did
not come to the surface, and all that
could be found after a most diligent
Bearch was his hat.
The tug Vigilant is back among the
Spreckels fleet again, and Captain John
Bilovlch is once more happy. There
was a hitch over the price of the vessel,
anil Mr. Spreckels was only too glad to
get his vessel back again.
Captains Fulton and Mclntyre changed
steamers yesterday. Captain Johnson
went from the Fulton to the Hueneme
and Captain Mclntyre went from the Hu
eneme to the Fulton.
The. Mare Island and Vallejo steamer
Monticello is to be laid up for a few days,
and the tug Sea Queen will take her place.
The Monticello is to have her guards ex
tended and other repairs made which will
make her a first-class sea boat.
F. Clark, a waiter employed at a rest
aurant on Pine street, met with a pecu
liar accident yesterday, and had his
wounds treated at the Harbor Receiving
Hospital by Dr. Green. Just as Clark was
making for the glass swinging door with
a trayful of orders In 'his hands a diner
in a hurry, flung the door open, and
Clark's bead went clean through it. He
was very badly cut by the broken glass,
and a dozen stitches had to be taken. in
his scalp by Dr. Green.
Captain Whitesides of the bnrk North
ern Light nearly broke his leg yesterday,
and, as it is, he will have to go aroun.l on
crutches for several days. A number of
piles to be used in the foundation of a
building on East street were lying on the
street. They were wet and slippery, hav
ing been just drawn from the hay Cap
tain Whitesides attempted to walk over
instead of around them, and in conse
quence got a very ugly fall. The genial

the chef, "is a new dish called raw fish
and mitte harrle. The raw fish Is com
posed principally of fish and the mltte
harrie Is a sauce made of salt water,
lime juice ami eocoanut milk. Try some?"
"1 don't mind if I do. I never heard of
this particular dish before." he proceeded,
ns be Started to pile enouph to make a
middleweight whale on his plate, "but
I have tasted some queer things in my
time.
"I remember when I was connected with
| the diamond mines in South America I
used to consider myself quite a gourmet,
j and never let slip an opportunity of try
' Ing my taste on something new. I went
through the whole gamut of South Amer
ican delicacies from plain beans cooked In
Jaguar fat to fancy butterflies brochette,
j but I think the most toothsome morsel
I ever ran across was a spare rib from
the fourth Quarter of a boa constrictor
i that I shot myself while out blrdsnest
1 ing in the Andes at a place called High
Rail, some 7000 feet above the sea level.
We merely smeared the meat over with
a little juice obtained by crushing some
leaves of the Pampata and, sticking: it
on the end of a native lance, allowed it
to slowly broil over the camp fire. And,
upon my word. 1 don't believe I ever
tasted anything half so sweet in all my
experience."
"I c.in readily believe that." said the
quiet man at the other end of the Junch
counter, who had been takinp in the' con
versation. "But, if you will pardon me
for saying so, there is one thing which
seems rathor strange to me and which
I would like you to explain. Where is
the fourth auarter on a snake to be
found?"
"1 am glad you asked," replied the con
fidence man, "as I always like to be the
means of giving information to those who,
probably, have not had the same oppor
tunities of picking up knowledge by
travel that have been mine. The fourth
quarter of a snake, sir, is always to be
found about midway between the third
and fifth Quarters, and runs directly
along the spine from top to bottom."
"Of course, how foolish of me not to
have known that," said the aulet one.
"I thank you, sir, for your kindness.
Won't you have something to drink?"

Farmer : This is the third time since Spring you
have lost your time because you don't feel
well enough to work. If you will buy
some Ripans Tabules and take one at
night, or one after each meal for a day
or two, you'll be all right, and stay so,
rtoo, if you take one when you notice that
you begin to feel bad. I don't use a
dozen a year, but I always keep them in
the house.
