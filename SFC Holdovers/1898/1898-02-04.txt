Constable Frank Newby and John W. Bird Hear
the Human Monster Gloat Over
His Crime.
SUISUN, Feb. }.. â Frank Belew is in prison, charged with the murder of
his brother and sister.
He was arrested on a ranch eight miles beyond Elmira, at 10 o'clock, as
a result of the vigilance of officers, aided by The Call, and was hurried here by
carriage and placed in the County Jail an hour after midnight.
The affair was so quietly conducted that none suspected the plans of
Sheriff Rush.
The suspected man had become careless and the climax was a terrible
surprise to him. He is a strong man physically, but his hands shook within
their circling bands of steel. His eyes filled with tears as he stood helpless in
the presence of the officers of the law. His voice faltered, but faltering it still
denied the charges,
"Gentlemen," he had said when the click of the manacles first made him
realize the clutch of justice, "you have the wrong man."
This he repeated many times.
"I never did it," he added, but there was no confidence in the tones, and
they did not impress as being sincere. He licked his lips with feverish per
sistency. He looked about him, as if in each shadow there might be some
thing to fear.
The scene was a striking one. It took place under the open sky, the
moon throwing a radiant light, which made all the land seem robed in white, and
brought out with peculiar distinctness every detail.
For months Sheriff Rush has been working to discover the murderer of
Susie and Louis Belew, and during all of this time he has suspected Frank.
Others were content to let the matter settle itself into a mystery, to let the
assassination go unavenged and the law be cheated again. Sheriff Rush has
made no loud protestations of his intentions. He has simply been following
clews, patching together scraps of information, until finally "the clews led to
Belew, and the scraps became an unbroken chain.
Then the Sheriff acted.
Yesterday afternoon a train from the city was met at Benicia by a repre
sentative of The Call. On board was the Sheriff. A conference followed, and
results were sudden and decisive. The Sheriff did not get off as the train passed
Suisun, his home town, but two deputies got on. These were Robinson and
Fitzpatrick, two stalwart men, who would not dread a task because it may have
danger in it When the train pulled out of Suisun few noticed the deputies, who
came in quietly, and few noticed that the Sheriff remained in his seat. Yet their
conduct was part of a plan.
At Elmira the party, which included a representative of The Call, took car
riages. There were whispered orders to the drivers, some curiosity manifest,
some evasive answers necessary, and the vehicles rolled out of the little town.'
None but those carried by them knew the destination.
The horses in front were put to a smart pace. The horse in the rear could
hardly keep up, and at times the larger rig was almost lost in the distance despite
the clearness of the moon. Mile after mile was reeled off without pause. The
Sheriff knew that he might be obliged to go as far as Dixon' and loss of time
could not be risked.
Suddenly the leading team was halted and there came from the carriage a
sibilant signal tor silence.
The place had (peen reached.
Leaving the horses by the outer fence, the visitors went through the gate,
across a growth of dark verdure by a path well worn. A few rods from the gate
stands a small house, a low whitewashed structure, that in the moonlight looked
almost ghostly.
No ray shone from within. No response was made to gentle knocks, and
it was only when the knocks became emphatic and voices had been raised to
shouting pitch that any sound could be heard inside the walls.
Then there came a sleepy inquiry, "Who's there ?"
There was no indication of haste to open the door. There was no wel
come when the door was opened. But, with civil, yet scant apology, the depu
ties pushed in, the Sheriff and newspaper man remaining on guard, so as to cover
all exits.
"Put on your clothes, Frank," said Fitzpatrick, and from the bed arose the
man who is now in a prison cell.
He is not, at first glance, an evil-looking man. He is distinciy animal,
however. All his features are heavy, his bones and muscles large, his chest
deep. A dangerous enemy in physical contest had he but courage.
It was not until Frank had dressed completely and stepped out upon the
lawn that he seemed to realize the seriousness of his predicament. He had made
it appear that he thought the officers were in search of a woman. Such a woman
had been spoken of. She was a fiction created for a purpose.
Completely clad to his overcoat, Frank is a jig man. He had just finished
pulling on his gloves when suddenly a weapon flashed in the hands of Fitzpatrick.
" Put out your hands, Frank," he said quietly, "you are the man who
killed your sister."
"For a hardly perceptible instant Frank hesitated. He glanced at the circle '
of faces, the array of weapons

SAN FRANCISCO, FKIDAY, FEBRUARY 4, 1898.
Prank Belew's arrest for the fiendish
murder of his brother and sister marks
an epoch in one of the most celebrated
crimes of the century.
Retributive justice has overtaken the
brutal wretch with the suddenness of a
stroke of lightning, at a moment when
he felt most secure, and when the pub
lic had given up all hope that the pois
oner would ever be brought to the gal
lows-tree.
In spite of the cunning with which he
planned the crime that swept his rela
tives away, and of the remarkable way
he sat at his sister'B bedside and
watched her drink of the waters of
death as he held her hand, he has been
outdone in cunning. From his own
lips have been heard the monstrous
confessions that stamp him as one of
the most infamous demons that the
ages have produced.
Frank Belew's arrest and confession
are strange proofs of the truth of the
statement of the immortal "Webster
that "murder will out."
The moral monster who committed
that dark crime is the one man in all
the world toward whom the finger of
suspicion was pointed by all who knew
the circumstances; yet the evidence
seemed forever lost until the murderer
himself gave it to the expectant world.
Before the victims of the murder
were burled The Call exclusively pub
lished the fact that Frank Belew was
the murderer. His own shameful con
fession, at a moment when he little
dreamed that hostile ears were listen
ing, is more marvelous than the tales
of Aladdin, mure dark and damning:
than the blackest pages from Dante or
Milton, and more cruel than the stories
of tortures common with savage races
and benighted tribes, in lands where
human blood is held of no more value
than water that : uns in ditches.

Two weeks ago Frank Belew was met
by a Call reporter in the Postofflce at
Dlxon. Discussing the murder of his
brother and sister he said: "We would
all contribute liberally to help hang the
fiend who committed this dark crime. I
don't think a worse murder was ever
committed In the United States. It
gave me lots of trouble, but I am glad
they have let me alone now and are
hunting elsewhere for the criminal. I j
do not believe there are many person,* |
in this county who will believe that I
could have poisoned my relatives and
held my sister's hand while she was
writhing in pain and slowly dying.
Tommy will tell you that I did more
for her and Lewis while they were suf
fering than anybody else did, and that
it broke me all up."
In its essential details the story of
B. F. RUSH, the Intrepid Sheriff of
Solano County, Who Ran
Poisoner Belew to Earth.
the murder and of Frank Belew's con
fession is as follows:
Satisfied that Frank Belew was the
murderer of his brother and sister, The
Call kept a reporter in the field for
weeks after the other daily papers had
abandoned the case. Lately it has
maintained special commissioners and
reporters in the field to aid Sheriff
Rush and those who represent the
State. Through the eftorta of thla
FRANK BELEW, the Monster Whose Confession
Convicts Him of the Murder of His Brother
and Sister.
1 combined force, seconded ably by Cap
[ tain Curtin of this city, whose zeal has
been unflagging 1 , the full details of the
monstrous crime are to-day given to
the world, and the murderer is behind
the bars confronted with an avalanche
of testimony from his own lips that he
killed those who were born of the
mother that first taught him to lisp
the words of prayer at her knee, while
those he murdered knelt by the same
bedside.
Lewis and Susie Belew were two of
the most ;-. popular â¢< young people In
Dixon. * They \ lived together in jfa
humble cottage on the outskirts of â¢ the
quiet : little town. ,; - I'â  .__ "".
, The night before they were poisoned,
early last ' November, Frank â¢ Belew ate
supper ?at the ; house. ; v He was the one
person '. who ;â  had f access %to \ the -; water
and the food. >. When the ; victims -. took
sick ;he was almost the f first : person \to
[ coma to ; their boms* Bo helped tha
nurses to make gruel, using water from
the tea kettle he had poisoned.
The monstrous murderer Insisted on
holding Susie Belew's hand while she
writhed in pain and pleaded with those
around her to give her relief from the
pangs of dissolution. He was with her
to the end.
At the funeral, which took place on
November 10, Frank Belew was dressed
in a suit of solemn black, apparently
one of the most deeply affected mourn
ers.
In the wild night of crime, however,
his mind slipped a cog. So fierce was
the storm of rage, so high leaped the
flames of ' revenge, that he forgot . a
threat he had made the day before. he
poisoned his relatives ; for the' purpose
of a few thousand dollars â a threat
that he would commit a crime that ;
would startle the world.
The â¢ day, : before he poisoned his
brother and sister the wretch who now
stands confronted with his own con
fessions called upon his brother-in-law, .
John f W. Bird, a Sacramento pho
tographer. He complained to him bit
terly, as he had done to others, that he
had not received enough of the prop
erty, of his parents, who overlooked
him in their will.
"I've just been down to' see Susie," I
he said. "She showed me her wedding
clothes and â¢ said she and" Charley Eh- I
man.were going to Nevada on a tour." i
"; The . fiend ' then passed, â  gritting his j
teeth and regretting that his sister and.
brother were ". both - about to marry, |
thereby introducing new people in the
family to divide . } the . hard earned j
wealth of his parents. In desperation j
he said: 'â¢.'â 
"They have not treated me right
in regard to the estate, but I'll have
some of it yet. : They'll not live to j
enjoy it."
There was a pause, some Interrup- |
tion causing a change of the ; subject.; j
Then the spirit of murder again spoke, |
saying: â¢ . . Â-..â¢
" "Bird, I'm going to commit a ter- j
rible crime to-morrow. I'm going J
to commit a tragedy that will shock
the whole community." â¢
Bird, whose wife was Frank's sister,
Ellen, said:
"Do not do :? anything foolish,' old
man. Think of .*. * the consequences ,of
such a crime." Â«'_ ' : "^ " ;
Belew said no more about his plans
of murder, ,; though he seemed dogged,'
morose, ;.'; determined. The ," men * then
separated " and â did > not meet again ; un
til after the funeral, where both had
attended apparently as sincere mourn- :
ers. Then there was a strange conver
sation. : - r ,.. .; .:: â¢, , .:;. â ",..'_< - . ..,â  ;; ....... '. . , -'.
"Well, you did what you said you
would do," said; Bird. /â  , ;' ;
, "Did what?" asked the murderer, ap
parently startled. '/-:j__
V" "Murdered ' Lewis ; and Susie."
; -> "Did I tell . you that?" he asked In
great trepidation.
"Yes." â  ." ; â :: Â»..ââ''

moment and said: "Yes, l I do remember
that I made a threat^ but I didn't tell
you I had done iU"-'^~~~- â . _^<
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
""Well, but I know you did it."
This was the substance of the re
markable conversation between the
murderer and the one man who bes-t
knew whose hand had caused thd
tragedy.
Since that time Bird and Frank
Belew have often met at Sacramento
and Dixon, discussing the munderinaU
its phases, part of the time when Con
stable Frank Newby of Dixon was se
creted so as to overhear the murderer
admit without a tremor that he slew
those whose death he pretended ta
mourn with bitter contrition.
Bird, the strange brother-in-law,
who has kept the dreadful secret for
months to save his wife from the dis
grace of being known to all the world
as the sister of an infamous moral
monster, at last made his confession
through fear.
Hints repeated with increasing fre
quency and persistency led him to be
lieve that the brutal wretch intended
to murder him so that no human be
ing could confront him with more than
suspicion.
"Frank has been trying to get me. to â 
go out hunting in the tules for a long :
i time," said; Bird last night. "He has
been. persistent in this request, and haÂ»
planned in every way to get me. to go ; ..

that he wanted to murder me- because!

MURDERER BELEW CAGED.
His hands were held out. Robinson snapped the iron cuffs about the
extended brawn wrists. Frank was at last a prisoner. The beginning of the end
was upon htm. It was a moment which he must have dreamed of and dreaded.
" Where are you going to take me ?" he asked, and, being told, he insisted
upon changing his clothes for a better suit. At first there was demur. With
handcuffs on Frank Belew is a person to be regarded with more equanimity than
with them off. Yet lie pleaded, and his captors yielded the point. He went
back to the house, the dreary little room. He turned back the coverlid of his bed,
showing where he had been at rest, and then donned a decent suit. Then he
meekly held out his wrists for the cuffs again. In a few moments he had
learned the lesson of submission. Then he sighed as he saw the officers rum
mage in the drawers of the rickety old bureau. They brought out letters, pic
tures, some of them old-fashi ned and in the quaint cases of years ago. There
were personal trinkets of no value, and yet the prisoner was grieved at the lib
erty the officers took with his trumpery. He was getting another lesson in
servitude.
Up to the time the party left the house the prisoner said hardly a word,
beyond to protest his innocence, but he did say the handcuffs were too tight.
His brother, Arthur, looked on dumbly. The friend of the family looked
on, but kept silent. Frank Belew is strorg only in body. From the first moment
he was aroused from sleep he showed signs of weakness. It was evident that
with difficulty he repressed a tendency to express violent emotion. He did not
get over the tremor in his voice, but when it changed sometimes to a petulant dis
claimer it seemed to become more steady.
"I suppose," ventured the representative of The Call, "that you had antici
pated something of this kind ?"
"No, sir," was the reply. "I did not do this. You have the wrong man."
"Did you anticipate leaving the country before long?"
"No; I did not â but, well, it 1 did intend to go, that has nothing to do with this. lam
innocent."
"Don't you know that you have been talking about this case and made fatal
admissions?"
"1 never did. 1 never thought of this happening. You have the wrong man."
"Ho \ oo not remember having a conversation with Mr. Bird January 21?"
"No;'l don't."
"Try to tecall.Mr. Belew. It was the conversation in which you admitted your guilt."
"I do not know what you are driving at," the prisoner said, writhing in his seat.
"Perhaps you can remember the conversation of January 30?"
"1 don't know what you are talking about. 1 have had no such conversations. I'm
the wrong man, 1 tell you."
"Mr. Belew, you might as well know that these conversations were overheard; that
they were taken down and sworn to. Now, do you recall the subject?"
The moon beat into the man's face, showing the pallor which swept over
and settled there.
â¢â¢1 will answer no more questions."
His jaws closed tight, and only opened when he had to lick his lips, which
would go dry, or to reiterate to the officers that they had the wrong man.
All the way to Suisun he retained this attitude, partly defiant, partly
despairing. The officers did not try to question him. They have no care what
his answers may be, for it has been borne in upon them that they know the truth.
There was nothing in the nature of a farewell between the brothers. Arthur had
hardly spoken, and the most he said at last was that he would go straightway
to Dixon. And if any along the road by the side of which sleep Susie and Lewis
Belew heard this night the sound of horses' hoofs, mayhap it was made as Arthur

blood.

Constable Newby of Dixon Tells What
Belew Said in Bird's Photo-
r ' graph Gallery, :
The evidence that Constable B. F. Newby of Dixon has
gathered against the poisoner: is corroborative of the state
ment made by John W. Bird, Frank Belew's brother-in
law. This tireless and relentless official arranged to over
hear a conversation between Bird and Belew at the for
mer's branch photograph gallery in Dixon and incidentally
the revolting confession.
Newby gives the following account of the events of that
fateful Sabbathâ January 30, 1898â Sheriff Rush, Detec
tive Curtia and District Attorney Devlin :
I went 10 Sacramento on Friday, January 28, 1898, to see J. W. Bird,
to arrange for the meeting of Sunday, January 30, and perfected arrange
ments with Bird for the meeting at the Dixon gallery at 10:30 a. m. Sun
day, January 30. 1 returned to Dixon on the afternoon of the 2Sth. i
On Sunday, the 30th, Mr. Bird came to Dixon about 9 a. m. Frank
Belew did not get to town until 11:30 a. m.. After notifying Bird of his
arrival I went to my place In the engine house and waited for him to go
to the gallery, which ho did at 11:50 a.m. When he entered the gallery
I Immediately went to my place of concealment on the side of the gallery,
looked through the peep-hole and saw Frank Belew sitting about two feet
from me. I also saw Mr. Bird sitting at a table opposite Frank. They
were talking about Alaska. After a while Mr. Bird asked Frank what he
was doing down to Fairfleld during the week. Frank said: "Tom and I
went down to see our lawyer about the estate." He said ho had made
everything over to Arthur, that he had fixed things so that Steve Little
could get nothing. Said Little wasn't so damned smart after all. He
said Charles Newman had first put him on how to fix things so Little
couldn't get anything; that several of those who didn't like Little were
anxious to see him beat Little and asked him quite often how things were
coming out.
Bird asked him what the Grand Jury was going to do about his case.
If he had heard anything. He said he had not, but thought they would not,
as they couldn't get anything new. : â¢v â 
Bird asked him If he saw the District Attorney. He said "Yes," and
that he was as good as pie. He said, "There Is another election coming
on this year, and Devlin wants votes, and thinks he wants my help, and
won't bother mo any more; but I won't be here at election. I will be in
Alaska.' If everything goes well I want to go as soon as I get settled up,
which I think can't bo done before the middle of April."
Bird said: "Well, Frank, you fooled them all in grand shape
in this poisoning case, not to get caught."
Frank said: **Yes." â¢- â¢. , ; :':?: ':? â¢*â  ; .v - '"
Bird said: "Frank, that was a terrible thing; but you would
not have poisoned Louis and Susie if they had treated you right
with the estate before, would youP"
Frank said:, "No.''
Bird said: "They were after you pretty hot for a while. You
must have been pretty slick in getting the poison so they could
not find out where they got it, for they hunted every drug store
in Sacramento and all around."
Frank said: "Yes, and they went to you, didn't they?"
liir.l said: "Yes. 1
Frank snil: "Who?"
Bird said: "The reporters. All of themâ Call. Examiner and
Chronicleâ they were all after me, and also wanted your picture. I would
not tell them anything or give them the photo. I have been a friend to you,
Frank." '
"Yes." says Frank, "and If I can ever do anything for you, Bird, I
will do it."
Said Bird: "Yes, Frank, after you told me beforehand that
you were going to poison Louis and Susie, and then it happened
as you said, it worried me so I couldn't hardly eat or sleep
until after I had a talk with you about it. Then I felt better and
haven't thought so much about it since." *
Frank said: "Bird, you have been a friend to me and when
I go to the Klondike I want to take you with me."
Then Frank said: "Ellen don't know anything about it, does
sheP"
Bird said: "No, she don't know you did the poisoning."
Frank says: "Don't tell her. I don't want any one to know
I did it, but you and I." .
Bird says: No, If I should tell her, she might tell some friend, and
then some other friend, and it would get out, so its best for only ;us to
. know it."
Frank says: "No, I don't think she would tell it; she is a good
friend to me. but it would woiry her if she knew it and it's best
to keep it from her."
"It's enough for you and I to know you poisoned them," says
Bird.
Frank says: "Yes. and I am grateful to you for the friendship you have
shown me. and I would do anything for you. I won't go to Alaska
alone and I hope you will go with me."
At this time some girls came in and the conversation was â¢ turned to a
trip Frank had taken to Winters with an insurance man by the name of
Lancaster. Frank said Lancaster had hired him to take him over to Win
ters. â¢
When the girls had gone out Frank said: "Newby thought he was
raising hell for a while, but he has let up now. Guess he was out for the
money there was" in It." . â¢ '
Bird says: "Does he talk to you about the case any more?
Frank says: "No, but he patronizes the stable and sends business there.
Guesa he is all right now." . 'â 'â ,-; .
I Frank then spoke about taking some insurance out f or the benefit of
his boys (spoke of Foresters. Home Forum and other societies). in case
anything should happen him; also spoke of Tom's wedding, which he said
would take place next week. Â£lso spoke of business affairs with the es
tate; said Louis had $100 in bank and Susie $110; wanted to collect to meet
bills and not touch that. . -- "â -"â " /-
Tom passed by and Frank went to the door and hailed him. and then
came back and paid Bird some money. Frank said: "Tennie wanted to go
to the Klondike but did not know how she would get there, as she had no
money he said he told her she could get a divorce from him if she want
ed, but he would not give her the money. Said it cost him $113 to get a
divorce for her when he married her. so that the next fellow could do as
he did.
Bird said: "Arthur ought to be good to you for doing this job and get
ting a division of the property and giving him another stake."
Frank said: "Yes. but I don't believe he will take care of it. He got
a letter from Llttlefield the Other day, and I told him not to answer it as
Ilttleflold had heard he had another stake, : and Llttlefield's wife would
get* away with it. 3 Arthur says, â¢Llttlefleld owes â  me : money now, 1 but he
i answered the .letter." - . ' ,â '
â  Bird said- "Frank, you were not as big a fool -s that fellow Clark,
of Napa County. You we're sharp enough to come out of yours all right;
but that fellow Clark was a fool.". :
"Yes" said Frank, "that was a badly mixed-up family affair. Her hus
band ; should have left her long ago, after she bad children ; " by another
i : man."
After this the conversation 'changed, as a Mr. Coleman came in to have
some pictures takon. and after a few minutes ; Frank said: "I must go
back to the ranch. " â¢ . Â° .^SHnpSHI .. -
It was then 1:50 p. m. I left my place of concealment â  and } FranK
soon went out also and left for thÂ« ranch. . ... r
ment that It was he who had com
mitted the dark deed that shocked the
entire country.
The following strong intimation that
Frank Belew committed the murder
was printed in The Call the day after
the funeral of the murdered brother
and sister. It stands to-day as a truth
ful characterization of the murderer
and hl.s habits:
Frank Is a quiet man, who drinks very
Uttle It Is well known that he is in
financial distress; that he has had do
mestic troubles, and that he bitterly op
posed the marriage of his sister, which
waa to have taken plane to-morrow.
SuhU- B( lew went to Cashier J. H. R!ce
of the Dixoa Knnk two weeks ago and
asked him to draw her will. Speaking of
tho visit to-day Mr. Rice stated that th*
young lady said she Intended to cut off
both Frank and Arthur without any In
beritanoe, as Arthur had spent his money,
and for some reason she shared her par
entÃ' aversion to Frank.
If Frank Below disliked his dead
brother and sister it is not known to
many. If ho knew his sister had cut him
off In tho roughly drawn will that was
never executed he did not complain to
his friends, but kept his own counsel. If
he felt bitter over his portion at life's
CONSTABLE fi. R NEWBY of Dix
on Who Heard the Damning
Confession of the Poisoner-
feast he did not complain to those around
him. If there were any rows it is cer
tain that fhoy did not result in such acri
mony as to break family relations. This
appears from the fact that Frank Belew
was a guest at his sister's table at the
last supper she ever ate. The breakfast
following the supper at which Frank was
a guest and Louis the host contained the
fatal poiaon â or it was in the water of
which the tea was made.
Within two days after the murder
| the finger of suspicion was directed to
i the man who is now behind the bars.
! Belief was general that death resulted
from a cunning murderer's plan and
that he was the man. Though his
brothers stood by him and made a bold
i defense, the belief in his guilt has never
wavered. The poison of suspicion filled
the very air, piercing the minds of the
friends of the dead, and assuming
shape and direction.
The funeral was the largest ever
seen in Dixon. Shortly after noon on
November 10 the solemn ringing of an
old-fashioned church bell summoned
j the people of the town and country for
miles around to the First Baptist
Church to the funeral of the unfortu
nate brother and sister who were pois
oned on the eve of their wedding.
There yere no more popular young
i people in the village. As they had been
the pride of their parents, who left
them the bulk of their estate a few
years ago, so they were esteemed by
their fellow-men.
The afternoon was one of the most
beautiful of all the halcyon days of
autumn, and the long cortege filed sol-
FranK Belew's Threat to
Murder His Brother
and Sister.
The following threat was
made to John W. Bird, the
murderer's brother-in-law,
the day before he poisoned
his brother and sister:
"1 have just been down to
see Susie. She showed me
her wedding clothes. They
are going to Nevada fjr a
tour. She and Lewis have
not treated me right in re
gard to the estate, but I'll
have some of it yet. They'll
not live to enjoy it. I'm go
ing to commit a terrible
crime to-morrow. I'm going
to commit a tragedy that
will shock the whole com
munity."
emnly through the quiet streets, past
the places the dead had known, over
the leaf-strewn roads to the Odd Fel
lows' Cemetery. The funeral closed all
places of business, the schools were
shut for the day. and not even a sa
loon was open from neon until the min
ister had said the last word.
But there was another agonizing pic
ture, which was a part of the dread
ful mystery, that now becomes the
well proved crime of Frank Belew. It
was the picture of the sole survivor of
the household writhing in pain, hover
ing near death.
On a humble cot in the livery stable
that was owned by the murdered man
lay Bruno Kle4n, the faithful hired man,
who ate at the Belew home, whodrankof
the waters of death at the Belew well.
He was the sole survivor of all who
dwelt happily in the house of desola
tion. Just as the bodies of the dead
were being returned to elemental dust
a rumor spread throughout the city
that Klein was dying. Then there was
great excitement, and it would not have
required much evidence to cause the
lynching of Frank Belew.
So it has come at last that the cloud
that caused a pall over the sunshine
: and the flowers ar.d marred the golden
: beauty of a halcyon Xovember day in
Dixon is no longer a vague mystery,
j but a reality that has materialized into
I as dark and terrible a murder as was
j ever woven into the warp and woof of
j crime in the whole of America.
The skill with which the criminal at
first covered his tracks has been over
come by the acumen of those who have
been relentless in pursuit. The man
whose mind was fatally bent on mis
chief has been trapped by his own
words. Crime has left its shadow, its
footprints, its blighting evidence so
boldly written that the world may
read. Beneath the sunshine and the
stars the detectives have worked with
nnabating xeal, spurred by a sense of
duty and sustained and directed In
part by The Call, â which to-day gives
the only complete story of a murder
that will puzzle scientists to the end
of time.

SACRAMENTO, Feb. 3.â J. W> Bird,
brother-in-law of Frank Belew, was in
terviewed here shortly after midnight
in regard to the poisoner's arrest.
"Is that so!" was the surprised ex
clamation that burst involuntarily from
his lips, "where was he arrested?"
When he was told of the circum
stances. Bird's face grew very solemn
and his jaw gradually set v^ry firmly.
"Well," he said. "I have absolutely
nothing to say;, if he has made a con
fession that is his business, but I care
to say nothing."
Bird was pressed to make some state
ment as regards his knowledge of the
affair. He politely but emphatically re
fused to say anything at this time.
"Later on," he asserted, "I may have
something to say in the matter. Now,
however, I will say not a word."

Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Feb. 3.
Japan has been removed as an ele
ment in the opposition to the consum
mation of the annexation of the Ha
waiian Islands by the United States.
This result has been attained by the
conclusion of an agreement between
this Government and that of Japan, as
represented by Minister Toru Hoshi,
which, by practically settling the status
of the Japanese in Hawaii, removes the
only substantial difference that has ex
d between the two Governments.
The Japanese Government, for its
part, announced some time ago that it
no longer cared to interpose any ob
jection to the annexation of Hawaii,
based on principle. Since that time the
correspondence between Mr. Hoshi and
the State Department has been directed
to a satisfactory settlement of the
status of the resident Japanese in Ha
waii, and this last point has now been
adjusted, so far as the executive
branch of the Government is capable of
acting independently, the agreement
being reduced to the snape of a written
memorandum.
This tlocument which bas not been
generally taken into account in the
consideration of means for adjusting
the questions that have arisen over the
status of Japanese in Hawaii, goes into
effect in July next year, and among
other things it confers upon Japanese
within the territory of the United
States all of the rights accorded to the
citizens of the most favored nation,
which, of course, carries with it rights
nf naturalization and the exercise of
the rights of franchise. Presuming
that annexation is effected the Japan
ese in Hawaii will, in 1899, have the
same rights as those in the present
limits of the United States. All that
remains to be fixed is the status of the
Japanese during the time that must
elapse between the ratification of the
annexation treaty and the beginning of
the operations of the Japanese treaty
of 1899. Inasmuch as the pending an
nexation treaty provides for the ap
pointment of a commission to vis-it the
islands and prepare such legislation as
may be necessary to consummate the
amalgamation of the territories, this
last question can easily be adjusted
along with other details in the bill to be
reported to Congress.
There will be no vote on the Ha
waiian treaty in the Senate for at
least a fortnight, and it may be post
poned for a month. The friends of the
treaty to-day claim exactly the two
thirds necessary for ratification, but
they are not bo sure of these votes
that they dare risk a roll call. Just as
soon as they see the ratification ma
jority clinched a vote will be taken,
and not before.
If the success of the treaty is not
assured a joint resolution will be sub
stituted. Friends of the treaty have
been annoyed by the course of Senators
< handler and Wolcott, who have i>een
advocates of annexation, but who now
seek to delay and embarrass it. Both
these Senators, since the vote on the
Teller resolution, have declared their
intention of postponing consideration,
and yesterday in executive session
they Joined with Senator Thurston in
his attempt to sidetrack the treaty.
It is surmised that their purpose is to
worry the administration as a lesson
to President McKinley for his attitude
in regard to the Teller resolution.
Senator Chandler is as much inter
ested in Cuba aoin Hawaii, and lie
may insist thatnbefore going further
in the direction pf Hawaiian annexa
tion the Senate be assured that the
President will intervene in Cuba on
behalf of the insurgent's.
So far as the ratification of the
treaty is concerned the hope of the
Committee on Foreign Relations rests
In Senator Gorman. The Maryland
Senator is doing all he can to advance
Hawaiian annexation. He has shown
more genuine interest in this subject
than any other that has come before
Congress this session. If a Joint reso
lution be resorted to the only question
would be as to whether it could reach
a vote in the House. A majority in
the Senate is .assured, and there is
aiso a favorable majority in the
House, but . Speaker Reed is not
friendly to the scheme and it has been
doubted whether he would stand in its
way. Chairman Dingley thinks that
in this case the Speaker will do noth
ing to prevent the majority in the
House . and he. looks for favorable
action on a joint resolution.
Seina'tof â  White said to-day, after
introducing his resolution for non
intervention in Hawaiian affairs by
other ; powers, that he would call the
resolution up to-morrow and ask the
Senate to pass it without debate. He
addrft that it was his opinion that our
. intention -.to defend the independence
of the .islands has been made suf
ficiently- clear in the past, but that it
would do no harm to reaffirm the doc
trine by Congressional declaration at
the present time. _
AMERICAN
CITIZENSHIP
ASSAILED
The Secretary of State,
acting for the President
of the United States, and
the Japanese Minister at
Washington, acting for
his Government, have
entered into an agree
ment, under the terms of
which Japan withdraws
all objection to the an
nexation of Hawaii to
this country, in consid
eration of the virtual ex
tension to the Japanese
in the United States of
the rights of citizenship,
including the franchise.
In other words, Hawaii
is to come in as a State
or Territory, dominated
by Japs, and the nation may see the spectacle of Japanese sitting in both
houses of Congress, and there will be thrown into the electorate of the Pacific
Coast States a body of Asiatics alien in every way to the spirit of American
institutions.
It is too high a price to pay for the islands. Even Congress and the
President should respect Anglo-Saxon civilization and the sanctity of
American citizenship.

RICHES OF THE
LITTLE GEM
Wonderful Strike Made at
the Washington
Mine.
Ore Assays From Twenty-Five
to Forty Thousand Dollars
to the Ton.
Now There Will Be a Great Rush to
the Gold Field on an Indian
Reservation.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
COLVILLE, Wash., Feb. 3â One of
the richest strikes ever made in the
Northwest is reported in the bottom of
the 90-foot shaft in the Little Gem mine
about three miles east of Rockcut and
one mile from the well-known Little
Giant mine, in what is known as the
Pierres Lake district of the north half
of the Colville Indian reservation. This
portion of the reservation was thrown
open to mineral settlement in 1896, and
in the last few months has developed
several mineral surprises, the greatest
of which is this.
Yesterday samples from the bottom
of the Little Gem shaft were brought
to Marcus. They showed malleable
free gold, and assays gave values of
from the unprecedented figure of $25,
000 to $40,000 a ton. The samples were
not mere chips, but were chunks of
rock six inches long, which would
weigh from five to ten pounds. It is
reported the vein runs transversely
across the bottom of the shaft, describ
ing nearly a perpendicular dip, and is
fully ten inches in width, with free gold
sparsely scattered through the rock
outside the vein.
The property is owned by the Federal
Mining Company of Spokane. A big
rush to the Pierres Lake district has
started from all portions of, the reser
vation as the result of the strike. It
is expected when the news reaches Spo
kane there will be a still greater rush.
It is anticipated the rush will be even
grater than that of last summer into
Eureka on the western portion of the
north half of the reservation, when the
Republic mine was struck. Eureka
now has a population of 2500, but will
have to give up some of her! popula
tion in favor of the new camp.
Should the quartz which carries this
wonderfully rich value, as shown by
the assay, prove to be only a pocket, it
would nevertheless, according to min
ing experts, indicate the presence of
rich ore bodies. The owners of the Lit
tle Gem are close-mouthed about the
matter. While they deny the rich
values come from a pocket, they offer
no description of the property. It is
expected this spring will see an enor
mous rush from all parts of the North
west to the north half of the reserva
tion, which with its two millions of
acres, is proving to be fabulously rich.
Just north of the boundary line the
rich mines of British Columbia havo
been refractory ore propositions, but in
this new region, forty miles from the
Canadian mines, the rich strikes have
all been free gold. The experience of
the Republic is likely to be repeated by
many. Development was begun two
months ago on that mine. There is now
two million dollars' worth of ore block
ed out. running as high as $800 a ton

LEASE OF LIFE
Reprieved by Governor

of June.
Should His Sanity Be Estab
lished He Will Then
Be Hanged.
Meantime the Commission of Lunacy
Will Make a Thorough
Investigation.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 3.â Governor
Budd to-day granted Salter D. Wor
den, awaiting execution at Folsom
Prison for participating in the wreck
ing of the overland train in Yolo Coun
ty during the strike in 1894, another re
prieve until June 17 of this year. Un
less by that time he is granted another
reprieve or is pardoned Worden will
be hanged on the date designated. The
reprieve was issued to enable the com
mission of lunacy appointed by Gover
nor Budd to inquire into Worden's
mental condition, to continue its In
vestigation. It is most likely that the
Governor will be guided in his future
acts in the matter by the nature of
the lunacy commission's report.
Recounting the facts of the reprieve,
the Governor's order reads: "A large
number of organizations and citizens
of this State and of the United States
have petitioned me, asking that I com
mute the sentence of death heretofore
Imposed upon said S. D. Worden. This
request has also been made by many
prominent State and Federal officials
occupying exalted Judicial and legisla
tive positions, and by the Hon. Grover
Cleveland, former President of the
United States. The request is chiefly
based upon a claim that the said Wor
den is and was mentally unsound and
not fully responsible for his acts. For
the purpose of enabling me to deter
mine this fact, I have heretofore re
ferred this question to Drs. Gardner
Hatch and Clark for examination and
investigation, with a request that they
report to me their opinion as to his
sanity or moral responsibility, and they
have asked for an extension of time
with which to correct and conclude this
examination and to make the report re
quested."

NOW SUBJECT TO ARREST.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON, Feb. 3.â An Auburn
(Maine) special says: Interest in the
famous Melcher-Hadley affair, which
occupied so much of the public atten
tion last September when that breach
of promise case was tried here In the
Supreme Court, has been revived by the
return of Mrs. Louise Dingley-Hadley
from San Diego, Cal., where she mar
ried the wealthy hotel proprietor of
that city. It will be remembered that
Mrs. Hadley is the niece of Congress
man Dingley.
It is feared that she has bearded the
lion in his den by thus baldly return
ing to the scene of the old trouble, and
it Is said that she may be taken into
custody in the legal process of the exe
cution of the judgment awarded
against her.
Arthur S. Melcher of Auburn, her re
jected suitor, got a verdict of $1789, and
the judgment as made up was $1848 30.
Mrs. Hadley refused to pay, as did her
father, the Hon. Jeremiah Dingley, who
is reported to be the wealthiest man in
this section of the country. The most
sensational attempts are constantly be
ing made to collect the money, but so
far they have been In vain. An exe
cution was issued October 15, 1897, and
Monday another execution was issued.
This has been returned to the clerk of
the Supreme Court with judgment not
satisfied.
George C. Wing, counsel for the
plaintiff, sent Deputy Sheriff Cum
mings to the home of Mr. Dingley,
where his daughter is stopping, to
serve a paper upon her. Mr. Cummings
was told that Mrs. Hadley was sick
and could not see him. Later the Dep
uty Sheriff was sent to the house again,
but he could not gain admittance in
spite of his several determined efforts
and persistent demands, and so the pa
pers were left in the vestibule of the
house. Mrs. Hadley has now been
cited to appear before Judge J. "W.
Mitchell, who is a Disclosure Commis
sioner, next Tuesday. If she is able
to show that she has no property she
will be obliged to take the poor debtor's
oath. If Mrs. Hadley and her father
persist in their stubborn Resistance to
the law and refuse to obey the sum
mons to appear before the Disclosure
Commissioner the police here say that
they will be compelled to resort to
sterner measures, and will certainly
have to subject her to the indignity
of arrest. It is stated by his friends
that Mr. Dingley has threatened to
defy the law, and declares that all the
Sheriffs in the Pine Tree State can't
compel his daughter to undergo the
humiliation of taking the poor debtor's
oath.
It is an interesting situation, and the
society people of the State are on the
qul vive for the latest developments
in the case. Some of the friends of
Mrs. Hadley say they are confident that
she will do the wisest thing before it
is too late, and not try to defy the law.
They intimate that she has signified
her willingness to pay the judgment,
but that she does not want to do it,
unless she is compelled to, out of fem
inine spite for Melcher..

This Shows That Relations
With Spain Are Now

Explanations of a Peaceful

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Feb. 3.â According to
an official statement by Captain Mur
phy, captain of marines on the cruiser
Brooklyn, when that vessel leaves the
New York navy yard to-morrow she
will go out for the purpose of meeting
unofficially the Spanish warship Vis
caye, under command of Captain Eu
bate. The Viscaye is expected to ar
rive in American waters about the time
the Brooklyn reaches Hampton Roads.
The Brooklyn, which is under command i
of Captain Cook, had orders to join the
Atlantic squadron, but Captain Mur
phy, when he gave out these facts at
the navy yard to-night, said that these
orders had been changed. He called
attention to the fact that the Brooklyn
had been ordered to proceed to Wind
ward Islands, and mentioned the place
at which she would touch, and said
this was proof positive of the position
the cruiser was to take. It was learned
from other sources that the Brooklyn
is to pay all courtesies to the Spanish
vessel which are accorded foreign ves
sels sailing in American waters.
MADRID, Feb. 3.â The war party
here has tried to make capital out of
the Montgomery's visit. El Correo, the
Government organ, puts them right
and says that in political circles the
departure of the Montgomery has
nothing to do with the political rela
tions between the United States and
Spain, and that all rumors to the con
trary are without foundation. The Gov
ernment of the United States, it says,
has acted in the matter with the great
est discretion, because, before he Mont
gomery left Key West, explanations of
the peaceful nature of the cruise were
fully given. One paper quotes a refer
ence to jingoes claiming indemnity for
the death of Dentist Ruiz, and says
that the Washington Government has
no claim against Spain. El Correo fin
ishes by saying that all the data show
the good dispositions and friendship
of the United States, which are the
best assurances of peace in Cuba.
GENERAL FLAGLOR
IS NOT SURPRISED
WASHINGTON. Feb. 3.â The Call cor
respondent to-night asked Chief of Ord
nance Flaglor of the War Department
whether he had seen a report to the ef
fect that at a test made at the Presidio
yesterday at least fifty pieces of the
shrapnel shells were defective. General
Flaglor said: "Yes, and it would not be
surprising if more than that number
were defective. They are old shells. The
department requires tests to be made fre
quently to ascertain if the stock of am
munition on hand at the different posts
is serviceable. It is not surprising that
a large proportion of the shells tested at
the Presidio were worthless. Indeed, this
is the very reason that the test was made
of the old stock so that we could replan
ish with a fresh supply."
The correspondent then saw General
Wilson, chief of engineers, about the or
ders sent to San Francisco yesterday to
rush the work on the fortifications.
"There is no significance in this action,"
said he, "we merely desire that the work
or the engineering corps in erecting the
fortifications keep pace with the ord
nance department, so that a place for
the guns and carriages will be ready
upon their arrival."

FRESNO, Feb. 3.â A complaint was
drawn up In this city this afternoon
charging Francis A. Fee. ex-District
Attorney of Madera County, with forg
ery. The document was mailed to Dis
trict Attorney W. H. Larew and a wai>
rant was issued upon it. Fee was im
mediately placed under arrest and waa
arraigned at once. He demanded that /â¢
his preliminary examination he set tot
hearing as soon as possible. It was
fixed for to-morrow forenoon at 10 : .
o'clock, and he was then released on
bail. , .;.
The alleged forgery is of a peculiar
nature, being the claimed changing of .'â¢
a document after it was signed, which
Is defined as forgery under the law, :."
The alleged crime grew out of a busi
ness transaction bet%veen the Conir â¢â¢;..'
mercial Bank of Madera and Watklns :
& Prosser of the Hunter Company of
that town. Some time last September
Watkins & Prosser became embar
rassed financially and they made a. bill; ;
of sale to the bank of all their lumber ...
and personal property of every de 4. â -'â /.â 
scription to secure the payment ;pf :..
their debts, amounting to between .$20,Â«.-..;'
000 and $30,000. The bank, in consldera*:' ;>'â¢
tion of the bill of sale, assumed pay*./.;:
ment of all the liabilities. . 'â¢â¢ '.â¢'.";â¢'â¢.â -':â "'
Fee acted as attorney for the. baxtjf"'*.:
and prepared the bill of sale, which
was signed by Watkins & . Prosser.. ; ; : .
Among the creditors was the firm of..-
Rosenthal & Kutner, to whom the lum-. .
ber concern owed $2429. It is stated /:' =
that that being their claim it was on : . â¢
the original bill of sale and was â¢ as'-|:'\ /:â â  â â 
sumed by the bank. After the bill .of : .
sale was signed by Watkins & Prossejr. '\
it is claimed that the bill of salewaa 1 .'.;;
returned to Attorney Fee, who is al- \' :
leged to have removed the first page
of the document, in which the Rosen
thai & Kutner claim is said to have : _':
been set forth. The document was
typewritten, and Fee is alleged to have
substituted a duplicate page, excepting
that Rosenthal & Kutner's claim was
omitted in the substituted page.
The alleged tampering with the dqc
ument was not discovered until recent
ly, when Rosenthal & Kutner present
ed their claim to the bank for pave
ment. The bank cashier referred to
the bill of sale and stated that he knew
nothing of the claim, as it did not ap
pear in the bill of sale, which was sup
posed to contain all the liabilities of
the erstwhile lumber firm, and they re
fused to pay the claim.
Rosenthal asserts that Lawyer Fee
had assured him that the claim of his
firm was included among the list of
creditors of Watkins & Prosser. It ia
claimed, on the other hand, however,
that the substitution of the page was.
made before the document had been
signed. When Fee had prepared the
paper the bank officials told him that
the bank had an agreement with Ro
senthal & Kutner different from that
with the rest of the creditors, and Fee
claims that acting upon that informa
tion he made the change complained
of. He declares that it was before the
bill of sale was signed.
Mr. Fee is quite a prominent lawyer
of Madera and was the first District
Attorney of that county, assuming the
office In 1893, when Madera was sep
arated from Fresno and made a county
by itself. He took a prominent part in
the fight for the formation of the new
county.

BERLIN. Feb. 3.â lt is an
nounced that the Bundesrath
(Federated Council) in plenary
6itting to-day, approved its com
mittee's proposal that a decree
should be Issued prohibiting the
importation from America of live
plants and shrubs and packages
containing the same. The decree
will also, within a certain meas
ure, affect American fruits.
These are to be examined by ex
perts on their arrival at German
ports; the packages found to be
infected with the fruit louse
will be excluded. Instructions to
this effect will be issued to the
customs authorities.
This announcement, which is
made by an official agency, ap
pears to indicate a measure dis
tinct from the decree issued on
Tuesday by Dr. Miquel, the
.Prussian Minister of Finance,
prohibiting the importation of
any kind of American fresh
fruit, but jt is difficult to as
certain the exact details. The
Bundesrath's measure, it is
pointed out, is "far less strin
gent than similar measures at
present enforced in individual
States of the American Union."
The Hamburg authorities to
day permitted the unloading of
apples from the United States,
owing to instructions received
from Berlin, as the result of the
protests nf the United States
Embassadnr. White, against Dr.
Miquel's decree. The Bundes
rat'n supersedes with its author
ity Dr. Miquel's decree, which
Beems ill-advised in its rigor and
suddenness, and which, natur
ally provisional, was occasioned
by the recently reported results
of experiments by Dr. Fried
rich yon Kueger, of the Agri
cultural High School. Tha
Bundesrath's action is due to a
series of vigorous protests from
shippers affected, and especially
those of Hamburg, on the lower
Rhine, and at Emmerich, and
still more to the protests of Em
bassador "White. Its decision
forbids the importation only
where the fruit is affected by
the Aspiditus pernlciosus, or
San Jose plant bug, which is
said to have done enormous
damage in the United States.
The Bundesrath's decree applies
to the whole of Germany and
makes matters momentarily bet
ter, but it is believed that its
future Interpretation will large
ly correspond with Dr. Miquel's
decree. Parties interested here
fear that the United" States will
resort to reprisals. Following
are last year's fresh fruit
imports In hundred weights:
American. 206.000; AuÃtro-Hun
garian, .607.000; Dutch, 861,000;
Belgian, 540,000; Italian, 303,000.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Feb. 3.
A brief cablegram from Embassador
White at Berlin that came to the De
partment of State last evening con
veyed the only official information so
far received as to the decree of exclu- j
sion of American fruit from Prussia.
This cablegram was so meager that a
request has been sent to Mr. White for I
further details. While it 1b not posi
tively known, it is supposed that the j
rtecree applies only to Prussia and not
to all Germany, a considerable limita- j
tian. Whether or not it also applies j
to Canadian fruit is a matter of specu- j
lation.
The German Embassador was a vis- !
Itor at the State Department to-day |
and spent some time with the officials. '
After talking with Secretary Sherman ;
and Assistant Secretary Day the Em- I
bassador was for half an hour in close |
consultation with Mr. Wasson, the |
Special Commissioner for the United
States In the negotiation of the recipro
city agreement. The Embassador had
no news from Berlin direct as to the
last decree, which threatens to kill all j
hope for the negotiation of any kind j
of reciprocity treaty or agreement
within the terms o-f the present tariff
act, as far as Germany is concerned.
It is gathered that the basis of the
decree, or rather the reason officially
sent 6\it by the Prussian Government
for the exclusion, is that some ship
ments of American apples, coming
from California, have been discovered
to be affected with the disease known
as San Jose scale, but just how Ger
man apples are endangered, even if
this fact should be established, is not
made plain.
One of the standing complaints
against American dried fruit, the trade
in which with Germany has assumed
enormous proportions, is again brought
to official notice by a report that comes
to the State Department from United
States Consul Ozmun at Stuttgart,
and Is to-day made public in the daily
Consular reports. He transmits a no
tice Issued by the Chief of Police of
Stuttgart, to the effect that most of the
Bample9 of American "appleings," or
dried apples, taken from the local re
tailers, show the addition of metallic
TO EXPLORE
THE COPPER
RIVER ROUTE
General Merriam Instructed to
Find a Supply and Mail Road
Within United States
Territory.
WASHINGTON, Feb. S.â The Secretary of War has telegraphed in
structions to General Merriam, commanding the Department of Colum
bia, February 1. to organize and send an exploring expedition over the
Copper River route in Alaska for the purpose of ascertaining whether
a practicable summer or winter route, wholly within the territory of
the United States, for mail and suplies, or for mail alone, could be
found to the mining regions on the Yukon between Forty-Mile Creek
and Circle City. The organization of the party and selection of officers
to command it is left to General Merriam. In case a practicable route
can be found, instructions were given to so mark it that it could be
followed hereafter. The party is to take, as far as practicable, such
supplies as may be found to be serviceable to relieve any persons in
distress that may be encountered. The natives of the Copper River
Valley have been reported as aggressive, and the officers in charge
will be expected to use their efforts to conciliate them. The party
will be instructed to proceed as far as practicable toward Circle City,
and if deemed advisable to communicate with the relief expedition
taking supplies to the Yukon, and the two parties will co-operate in the
work of exploration. The expedition probably will make an entrance
by Port Valdes or Prince William Sound, unless it be found that some
other point is made more advisable.
zinc in quantities of 5 grams to the
milogram, and warning all dealers that
they will be punished and their goods
confiscated if further sales of such
goods are made.
This complaint was made to the De
partment of State about two weeks
ago, the German Chief of Police in Co
logne asserting in his notice that the
zinc was present in the apples because
the Americans dry the fruit on "zinc
trays instead of wooden bars, as we
do."
Immediately one of the most enter
prising of our Consuls in Germany
visited an agricultural exposition then
going on in Germany, and reported
that all of the fruit evaporators ex
hibited, about fourteen in number,
were fitted with the alleged harmful
zinc trays, which were freely used in
Germany.
During the afternoon further advices
were received from Embassador White
as to the nature of the decree. It would
seem that the full details are not yet
obtainable in Berlin, but it is expected
that the Embassador will cable the en
tire decree as soon as he can obtain
possession of it. The important facts
that were established by the last ad
vices were: First, that the decree of
exclusion uses the word "American" as
descriptive of the place of origin of the
fruit, which would seem to include Ca
nadian fruit without question; second,
that the decree, instead of applying
only to fresh fruit, as was at first sup
posed, includes in the prohibition all
dried fruits from America-
State Department officials have not
yet recovered from their surprise at the
method adopted by the German Gov
ernment in accomplishing its object in
this matter, and undoubtedly the cor
respondence to follow will set this out
very clearly.
The objection to the course pursued
is threefold. In the first place, it is
said to be entirely without the slight
est warning, contrary to precedent and
discourteous toward the Embassador at
Berlin to make the decree and put it
into effect without the slightest warn
ing to him. In the second place, by
making the decree take effect at once
and stopping all fruit in transit, a great
injustice is done to shippers who thus,
without warning, are made to lose
heavily on their capital invested in the
fruit. Third, the decree is condemned
in that it makes no provision for the
admission of fruit of absolute purity;
permits no demonstration of origin or
healthful condition and, in fact, con
demns all fruit, good or bad alike.
These considerations are to be strongly
urged upon the German Government
as reasons why it should either revoke
or modify the decree on the lines indi
cated before any more radical action
is taken.

Changes That Revive the Old Stories
Concerning Major Meade'a
Removal.
Special Dispatch A The Call.
BOSTON, Feb. 3.â lt Is now two
months since Major Robert L-. Meade,
U. S. M. C, who for several years com
manded the marines at the Charlestown
navy yard, was detached from duty
and ordered to the command of the
marine guard at the navy yard at
Portsmouth, N. H. At the time of his
detachment several newspapers pub
lished an announcement that Major
Percival C. Pope had received orders
detaching him from duty at the Mare
Island navy yard and assigning him
to this station as a successor to Major
Meade. As a matter of fact. Major
Pope has not as yet been detached
from Mare Island navy yard, and no
one has been assigned permanently to
the command of the marine guard here.
Captain Kelton is acting in command
until a successor to Meade is appointed.
At the time of Major Meade's de
tachment there were various stories in
circulation as to why he was assigned
to duty elsewhere. Two daily papers
printed columns as to the probable
cause, and mixed the gallant old major
up in a pottage of canteens, sutler
stores, drunkenness among the men of
his command, temperance reform
clubs, protests of ministers, etc. But
Major Meade, who came of a family
which has added lustrous pages to the
history of the United States, came up
smilingly through it all. It is true he
was transferred from Charlestown to
Portsmouth, but then the "exigencies
of the service" may have required an
able man at Portsmouth. It is com
mon talk at the navy yard, however,
that Major Meade's removal was the
result of a well-laid plan by several
officers of this station; that the scheme
was formulated by a- number of his
own corps, and by careful nursing a
brood was hatched that worked in uni
son for his removal. The announce
ment that Major Pope was coming to
this station, it is undestood from a re
liable authority, was given out for the
express purpose of enlisting the inter
est of his friends, who are legion in
Boston, and to make the detachment
of Major Meade certain. It was spe
cially stated that Major Pope has been
detached from Mare Island and would
report for duty at Charlestown on a
positive date, but this was not true, for
he never received any orders. He heard,
however, that he was coming, and that
his friends had interested themselves
in his behalf, and now he probably will
come, for it is understood that he has
made an application to the Navy De
partment for transfer to Charlestown.
All his interests are centered in and
about Boston, and besides it is regarded
as the most desirable of all the sta
tions. It is rumored that within a few
days he will receive preparatory or
ders, and that in a day or two he will
receive formal and final orders to
Charlestown to report for duty early
next month. Pope has performed sev
eral tours of duty here, and is a popu
lar officer.

FAT DIVIDENDS IN DANGER
Now There Will Be Developments

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 3.â There ex
ists discord and dissension among the
stockholders of the City Water Com- j
pany, and It is impossible to predict at i
this juncture Just what the outcome I
will be. But whatever it is, it will be
to the advantage of the people of this
city.
Until The Call entered the field and
exposed the nefarious arrangement
whereby, through the agency of the
syndicated boodle press, the water
company stockholders were to have
clear sailing in their scheme to mulct
the city, there was no trouble among
the directors. It appeared to them that
they were certain to obtain either two
million dollars more than their plant
was worth or an extension of the fran
chise for fifty years. But now some
of the directors doubt whether they will
be able to do anything of the kind,
while other directors seem to think that
if the matter is diplomatically handled j
they will be able to secure an extension j
of the franchise or a fat price for the
rattle-trap improvements they have put
on the plant.
It is claimed that Messrs. Miner and j
Drake are the two stockholders who
represent large holdings who seem to j
think that the water company has the
good will to sell to the city at the ex
piration of the lease. They are intent
and insistent upon a fat price, and it
is claimed that they have stated that I
if the worst came to the worst the com- !
pany could go in arid obtain an ex- ;
tension of the lease.
It is also stated on good authority
that some stockholders are dissatisfied
with the manner in which Secretary
Stephen H. Mott and President W. H. ;
Perry have handled the affairs of the \
corporation in connection with the ex- j
piration of the lease. It is also said j
that when Messrs. Mott and Perry
heard of this they be<v.me very wroth
and promptly offered to sell their stock I
to the kickers at 60 cants on the dollar. '
This would make a total valuation of I
$1,800,000 for the entire plant.
Some of the kicking stockholders |
seemed to think that It would be an J
easy matter to get an application for
an extension of the franchise through j
this Council. When they were in- i
formed that if the application were
granted it would be necessary to have
a special train on hand to convey the |
Councilmen who voted for such exten- >
sion beyond the wrath of their constit- j
vents they seemed to be very much ;
surprised.
The truth of the matter is that some
of the stockholders of the water com
pany, who for a long period of years
have been drawing down big dividends
on their stock, have just had their
eyes opened to the fact through The
Call's presentation that the people of
this city are in earnest in this water
contest, and they do not propose to be
defeated. Treachery on the part of any
public servant in the pending negotia
tions they will neither condone, forgive
nor forget. These wealthy stockhold
ers are Just becoming aware of this
fact. The reason their eyes have not
been opened before is because the
Times, Herald and Express never per
mitted the real situation as to the wa
ter struggle to be disclosed through
their columns. But when The Call
opened the fight then for the first time
did the people have an opportunity to
hear their side of the case and be heard
themselves. That opportunity they
not only accepted, but they have not
been at all slow in expressing their
gratitude.
Unless the present discord existing
among- the water company stockhold
ers is healed up there will be some de
velopments within a few days. A party
named Herman de Laguna has filed an
offer with the City Clerk to construct
a water works plant for the city and
to obtain a water supply for $1,800,000.
De Laguna is not in good odor in this
city. He has been an applicant for
sundry franchises before, and when he
did get one he forfeited it. His offer to
take a $2,000,000 contract is looked up
on as simply ridiculous. It is thought
that he la not making the offer in good
faith. Whether he is or not the Coun
cil will not for a moment consider it,
as the standing of De Laguna does not
warrant it.

OVER THREE
MILLIONS FOR

An Appropriation Bill
Passed by the
Senate.
Preliminary Provisions
Made to Secure Needed
Irrigation.
Germany's Embargo on Amer
ican Fruits to Be Inves
tigated.
CAFFERY ON CORBETT.
White Introduces a Resolution in
Reference to the Rights of the
People of Hawaii.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Rigs House.
Washington, Feb. 3.
One of the features of to-day's ses
| sion of the Senate was a speech by Caf
i fery of Louisiana in support of the res
olution reported by the Committee on
Privileges and Elections declaring that
Henry W. Corbett is not entitled to a
seat in the Senate from the State of
Oregon. Mr. Corbett was appointed as
Senator by the Governor of Oregon
after the failure of the Legislature to
elect a successor to Senator Mitchell.
Caffery maintained the Governor of a
State had no authority to appoint to
fill an original vacancy â a vacancy be
ginning with a new termâ after the
Legislature had had an opportunity to
elect and had failed to do so.
The agricultural appropriation bill
was under consideration oaring the
greater part of the afternoon and final
ly passed. After a brief executive ses
sion the Senate adjourned.
Germany's order prohibiting th* hn
portation of American fruits into that
empire called out a resolution from Davis
of Minnesota, chairman of the Committee
on Foreign Relations, calling upon the
President, if not incompatible with the
public interest, to transmit to the Sen
ate the correspondence and other infor
mation bearing upon the matter in his
possession or in that of the State De
partment. The resolution was agreed to.
In accordance with notice given, Caf
fery of Louisiana called up informally
the resolution reported from the Commit
tee on Privileges and Elections declaring
that Hon. Henry \V. Corbett is not en
titled to a seat in the Senate from the
State of Oregon.
Caffery spoke in support of the com
mittee's report against seating Mr. Cor
bett. He claimed a constitutional Leg
islature had failed to elect, and the
United States Senate could not put a
premium upon such dereliction of duty
and thereby allow a Governor to appoint
a favorite of his to a seat.
The agricultural appropriation bill was
then taken up. During the discussion of
the bill Cullom yielded to White of Cali
fornia for the introduction of this Joint
resolution:
"Resolved, That of right it belongs
wholly to the people of the Hawaiian
Islands to establish and maintain their
own form of government and domestic
policy; that the United States ought in no
wise to interfere therewith, and that any
intervention in the political affairs of
these islands by any other government
will be regarded as an act unfriendly to
the United States."
The resolution was passed by the Sen
ate on May 31, 1894, having been reported
by Turpie of the Committee on Foreign
Relations. White asked that the resolu
tion lie on the table.
Cullom then called up the agricultural
appropriation bill, the reading of which
was concluded last evening. Pending the
submission of certain amendments to the
bill, Platt of Connecticut expressed his
regret that the committee had not strick
en from the bill the appropriation for the
purchase and distribution of seeds. He
read a letter from a number of members
of a Connecticut Grange, in which the
statement was made that the seeds sent
out by the Agricultural Department were
not good, could not be depended upon,
and were of no use to the farmers or gar
deners.
In reply to Platt's brief statement, Al
len thought that the chief opposition to
the Government's distribution of seeds
came from those who themselves had
seeds for sale.
The amendment to the agricultural bill
offered by Warren, providing for a di
vision of irrigation and reclamation of
arid lands, for the investigation of meth
ods of constructing irrigation canals and
of storing and distributing water in the
reclamation of arid lands, the whole to
cost $21,300, was discussed briefly by its
author and by Stewart of Nevada. It
was maintained that the adoption of the
amendment would be of enormous value
to the Western country.
Cullom proposed as a substitute for
Warren's amendment the following:
"For the purpose of collecting from ag
ricultural colleges, agricultural experi
ment stations and other sources, includ
ing practical agents and engineers, prac
tical Information and data on the sub
ject of irrigation, and publishing the
same in bulletin form, $20,000."
The amendment was adopted and the
bill, carrying $3,237,022, was passed.
The Senate, then, at 5:25 p. m., went
into executive session. At 5:28 p. m. the
Senate adjourned.
COAST FORTIFICATIONS
During the Discussion in the House
Political Topics Crop
Up.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 3. â The House
spent the day ostensibly considering the
fortifications appropriation bill. In real
ity the major portion of the time was
consumed In the discussion of political
topics. The existence of prosperity in this
country was again the main question of
dispute. The feature of the day was the
discovery by Simpson, the Kansas Popu
list, and the exploitation of the alleged
fact that Dingley, chairman of the Ways
and Means Committee, wore a London
made pot hat. Dingley explained that
the hat was made in New York. The
London trademark was simply placed
there to please the Anglo-maniacs who
always preferred things because they
were English. All attempts to increase
the appropriations in the fortifications
appropriation bill or to amend It in any
respect were voted down to-day.
A bill was passed appropriating: $10,000
for a survey and report on the practica
bility of securing a thirty-flve-foot chan
nel in the Southwest Pass on the Missis
sippi River.
Foote (R.) of New York then devoted
some time to the criticism of the fortifica
tions bill. At the rate of appropriations
provided in this bill, he said. It would re
quire fifteen years to carry out the plans
of the Endicott board. He asserted that
on the South Atlantic and Gulf coasts
there was not a gun that could be fired
in defense of the narbors.
At 3 o'clock the general debate closed
and the bill was taken up for amendment
under the five-minute rule.
McClellan (D.) of New York offered an
amendment to increase the appropria
tion for guns and mortars from $1,000,000
to $5,000,000. It was voted down.
Without completing the bill at 5:05 p.
m. the House adjourned.
SLAUGHTER
OF STRIKERS
AT LATTIMER

Officers.

vance of Murderous
Intentions.
Many of the Victims Shown to
Have Been Shot in the
Back.
BUTCHERED MERCILESSLY
So Far the Testimony for the Com
monwealth Puts the Acts of the
Sheriff In a Bad Light
BpÂ«clal Dispatch to The Call.
WILKESBARRE, Pa., Feb. 3.â The
taking of testimony in the trial of Sher
iff Martin and his deputies began to
day in the Luzerne County Court. At
torney McGahren presented the case
for the Commonwealth.
McGahren told how the strikers had
started to march from Hazelton to Lat
timer and about the deputies boarding
the cars and attempting to intercept
the men.
"We will prove," he said, "that at
this point some of the deputies made
threats; that one of them said: "111
bet I'll drop six of the strikers.' An
other said, 'I hope we get a chance to
take a pop at some of them.' " Mc-
Gahren then described the shooting.
Andrew Siver was the first witness
called. He is a Hungarian, but speaks
excellent English. He proved the death
of Mike Cezlek, saying that he saw him
lying dead on the road at Lattimer
with a bullet in his head. Witness saw
the Sheriff draw his revolver and heard
it snap, and then the shooting com
menced.
The defense attempted to show that
the witness had been enc iged In ter
rorizing men who did not want to
strike to such an extent that they were
forced to Join the strikers through fear
of injury, but the court would not al
low It. Later the defense asked the
witness if he had not been engaged in
or known of sundry cases of violation
with the strikers as aggressors on the
day of the strike. This the witness de
nied.
The second witness was John Manala,
who was at the time of the strike the
president of the Harwood local union
of the United Mlneworkers of America.
He told of the meeting, where it was
agreed to march to Lattimer, at the
invitation of the miners there; his
counsels of peace, and the start the
next day, all the men being unarmed.
At West Hazleton they were stopped
by the Sheriff, who ordered them to
disperse. Manala protested that they
were breaking no law, whereupon one
of the deputies grabbed the American
flag he bore and tore it in halves. "The
Sheriff pointed his revolver and threat
ened to shoot," said Manala. "The dep
uties pushed us around with the muz
zles of their guns and swore at us, and
one struck John Eustis twice with his
gun, cutting his head and breaking his
arm in two places. Then Burgess
Jones of West Hazleton remonstrated
with the Sheriff, saying that he could
keep the peace without using any
weapons; that he had confidence in us
and would let us march through the
streets of his borough as much as we
liked. The Sheriff and his deputies
then boarded the cars and we marched
on toward Lattimer."
Witness was in the road when the
shooting commenced. He saw ten men
and a number of wounded lying In the
road.
Rev. Father Richard Aust, pastor of
the St. Stanislaus Polish Catholic
Church at Hazleton, chairman of the
prosecuting committee, was called to
prove that many of the strikers were
shot in the back. He said he had ex
amined a number of the dead, but could
not tell in detail what their wounds
were. He had burled thirteen of the
dead.
Rev. Carl Hauser, pastor of the
Lutheran church at Freeland, said ho
had examined several, and found all
of them w.ere shot in the side or back.
"I boarded a car," he said, "which
brought ten of the dead and a lot of
the wounded from the scene of the
shooting. There was a pile of rifles in
the corner. I paid to one of the dep
uties, Frank Clark, "I am afraid of
some of them falling and exploding.'
'You need not be afraid,' he replied,
'they are all empty now.' "
Charles Guseott. principal of the
Lattimer School, a building about 600
yards from the scene of the shooting,
said he was teaching school when he
heard an unusual noise, and going to
the window he found that a number of
men, some eighty, were alighting from
an electric car. They were deputies.
He saw the deputies line up to the side
of the road and form with rifles ready.
The strikers were by this time some
two or three hundred yards away.
They were marching five or six abreast
and were quiet and orderly. Witness
could not Bee that they carried any
weapons. As they drew near the
Sheriff advanced to meet them. As he
reached the first man a dozen or so
formed a sort of half circle around
him. He did not hear the Sheriff say
anything, nor did he see him read any
paper. A minute after the line first
stopped those behind pushed ahead to
see what was going on and got ahead
of the Sheriff. At that moment one of
the deputies stepped out of the line
and advanced, and one shouted. "If
you do not come back we will shoot
you, too." The fellow jumped back
Into line, and almost immediately after
the witness heard a shot, it came
from the left line ot deputies. A mo
ment later two shots were fired and
then came the volley. As soon as the
volley was fired the strikers ran in all
directions. Between the road and the
schoolhouse fifteen men fell, struck
down by shots fired after the first vol
ley. He saw a man shot and killed
while running at full speed at a dis
tance of 100 yards from the road. The
shooting continued for some two or
three minutes. The witness did not see
any of the deputies leave the line and
run after the strikers to shoot them.
He knew a number of the deputies
and saw them plainly just before the
Bhooting occurred.
The hearing will be continued to
morrow.

Deed.
Special Dispatch to The CaM.
TUCSON, Ariz., Feb. Iâ Jose Lopez
was brought in from: the lower San
Pedro Valley yesterday Under guard of
several cowboys and placed in the
I County Prison, charged with the mur
der of his wife. The deed was one ot
dreadful atrocity, the unfortunate
woman having been almost chopped to
pieces with an ax. Lopez and wife
lived at Redington, a small camp forty
miles northeast of Tucson. The man
went suddenly insane or was frenzied
through drink and started out with an
ax to terrorize the village. After chas
ing several of his neighbors he returned
to his home, where his wife was lying
asleep in bed. With one blew he cut
open her head, then hacked at the
body till he became weary. He waÂ»
afterward surrouirded and captured.
The body of : the woman was also
brought to Tucson and was buried here
In consecrated ground.
Lopez, who is about 30 years o}J, will
be held to answer to the Grand Jury
on a charge of murder. He is a quiet,
stolid Mexican, generally believed to be
harmless, and has usually been respon
sibly employed by the stockmen of the .
San Pedro Valley. Any insanity he
might have exhibited was simply jeal
ous rage. so. hig captors say.
The wife was about; 20 years of age
and was highly esteemed among her
class. They had been married a year.
Beside her in the bed, when her maniac
husband brained, her,-, was her two-
Weeks-old child. Several years ago
Lopez attempted suicide by dashing his
head against the biade of an ax.

SHANGHAI, Feb. 3.â The China
Gazette says the British Indian, Aus
tralian and Pacific squadrons have
been ordered to be ready to re-enforce
the 'fleet In the far East, thus giving
the British admiral a fleet capable of
coping with "any combination oppos- \
ing 'British policy."
In the meanwhile, adds the China i
Gazette, the British claims in the
Tang Tse Kiang will be supported by
a strong squadron stationed at Chu
san, to which place two other war
ships are en route. In the event of
Russia hoisting her flag over the forts
at Port Arthur the British admiral j
has been ordered to raise the flag over j
Chusan, arid the Japanese will ascend :
the Tang Tse Kiang as soon as the i
river rises.
About 7500 Russian artillery and j
cavalry, with stores and munitions,
have arrived at Kirin, the capital of
the Manchurlan province of Kirin.
LONDON, Feb. 3. â According to a
special dispatch from Shanghai, pub
lished to-day, two British warships j
entered Port Arthur yesterday and left
without anchoring.
On incontrovertible authority it is
learned that Great Britain has not
backed down on the question of mak
ing Talien Wan a free port. The Mar
quis of Salisbury, Mr. Curzon (the
Parliamentary Secretary of the For
eign Office), the Russian Embassador
and the Chinese Minister each said
yesterday, in conversation, that they
bad not heard of any backdown.
The opening of Talien Wan, it is
pointed out. was never made a condi
tion in any sense in connection with
China. The preliminary negotiations
on that subject, the opening of Talien
Wan was "sketched" in neutral tints,
Great Britain only suggesting it as
one condition fa^ >ring a speedy com
'pletitin of the loan. She never de
manded It, and therefore in no sense
can be said to have backed down, if
the desire was not persisted in. The
Talien Wan question is, However,
â with other suggested conditions of the
loan still negotiating.
The heat of the Russian press on the j
subject is in no sense shown by the !
Russian Government in its communi
cations which have reached the For
eign Office. Though Russia has pro
tested and means to continue to pro- j
test in the stoutest manner against Ta
lien Wan being opened by British in- !
fluence, she will not tarry her protest j
to the point of making it a casus belli. :
Further, it is by no means Russia's \
Intention to close China to other na
tions in any concessions made to Riis- !
sia by China. The irritation in Great ;
Britain and the disappointment in the !
United States over the so-called back- j
Ing down of the Marquis of Salisbury j
Is therefore not yet justified. Great â 
Britain is acting strenuously in favor j
of free .ports in China and hopes sin- j
cerely to have the moral support of the :
United States in this policy. If events
should push Great Britain from this
position, at the prospect of defeat i
therein, she will ask for the support of
Washington.
Some of the afternoon papers to-day
refer to the absence of Russian and !
German Embassadors at the Marquis
of Salisbury's regular Wednesday re
ception of the diplomatic corps as be
ing a disquieting portend.

PEKING, Feb. 3.â There have been

PT: PETERSBURG, Feb. 3.â lt is as- I
serted that although M. Dewitte, the
Minister of Finance, has ordered a sus
pension of sales of stock on the mar
ket as a preliminary to an issue of a
Chinese loan, nothing nas yet been de- j
cided upon.

loan on the ground that Japan declines j
to evacuate Wei-Hai-Wei before the '
stipulated time, even if the indemnity i
is paid.
LOS ANGELES WHEELMEN
IN FATAL COLLISION.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 3.â A fatal col- !
lision occurred between a couple of '
â wheelmen near the corner of Third and
Main streets this morning, one of the
men dying at the Receiving Hospital '
about two hours after he was hurt. !
while the other was taken to his home
for medical treatment, as he, too, was
quite badly bruised and cut up about j
the head. .
The accident occurred a few minutes
before 7 o'clock. S. W. Page, a sales
man in the employ of Charles Gassen,
was coming south on Main street at a
rapid pace. Just before he reached the
corner of Third he suddenly cut across i
the street and was struck broadside by j
Merman Glass, a young man living at !
No,. 440 Wall street, who was also riding !
at a rapid rate of speed. The shock [
was something terrific and Page was 'â 
thrown violently to the cobble pave- j
rnent, striking on the back of his head, j
while Glass, went flying in the opposite !
direction, also falling on the pavement
oh his face and head.
â¢A number of people at once rushed to
the assistance of the men, but it was at j
or>ce apparent that nothing could be i
done for Page, who was unconscious J
and bleeding from the ears, indicating
that the skull had been fractured.
MARQUIS ITO,
A DIPLOMAT,
IS RETICENT.
But He Says Japan Will Be
in a Position to Take
Care of Her Own
Interests.
TOKIO, Feb. 2.â Marquis Ito received me to-day at his official resi
dence. He' said: "Concerning matters of foreign policy, I must be
necessarily reticent. The Government of Japan is watching the situa
tion in the east, and is prepared to safeguard Japan in this by what
ever means may be required by events. I am investigating the ex
isting condition of international affairs. I retired from power only
sixteen months ago, but there have been so many changes under the
late government that I feel I need to study the situation carefully
before announcing my policy and plans. The Diet to be elected on
March 15 will probably convene about the middle of May. By that
time I shall be ready to lay a programme before Parliament."
"Do you approve the proposal to increase the Japanese navy to
400,000 tons, now advocated by several Japanese newspapers?"
"Every nation," the Marquis replied, "would like to be as strong as
possible. Such an increase would require several years and a great
deal of money. We would not hesitate, however, to make the neces
sary sacrifice if circumstances demanded it. I would like to have you
inspect the Japanese fleet and see how well disciplined it is. We are
stronger than ever before.
"I believe in making public school education practical and harmon
izing the training therein given with what are called modern progres
sive ideas, bringing it into line with American methods. This will re
ceive very careful attention from my government."
"Do you expect to go forward with colonizing Formosa?"
"Tes; I hope to pacify it soon and extend our control to all parts
of the island and develop its great resources."
The Marquis said he thought the result of the coming election of
the Diet very important. The political situation, said he, was very un
certain, and it was possible that such members might be elected as to
give no party a majority.
"The people," he continued, "are now greatly interested in econom
ic questions. They are inclined to get rid of mere politicians and elect
really representative men who understand the needs of the manufac
turing industries and commerce. The late government adopted the gold
standard. The change is too recent to judge of its permanent effect."
"What will be Japan's attitude toward Hawaii?"
The Marquis laughed, and replied: "No, I don't regard that inci
dent as important. Negotiations are Just where they were. My gov
ernment will cultivate friendly relations with the United States, whose
people always had a friendly feeling for Japan."

Councilmen J. P. Fay. Julius Krieg,
George B. Dittus and William T. Nol
ting and the contracting firm of Nash
& McÃeynolds from entering into a
three years' contract for sweeping the
streets of the city.
The grounds set forth in the com
plaint are: That the letting of the
contract is in violation of the pro
vision of the charter -whic hprohib
its the contracting of a debt in any
quarter in excess of the money avail
able for that period, and that for the
quarter ending March 31, IS9B, there
will be but $1350 in the street contin
gent fund, while under the contract of
Nash & McÃeynolds the street sweep
ing will amount to $595 per month, or
51785 per quarter.
It is also further alleged that the
contract with Nash & McÃeynolds
cannot be lawfully entered into, as
their contract was not the lowest.
The complaint recites that but $27,
000 has been raised for the street con
tingent fund for the year commenc
ing July 1, 1897; that the street sprink
ling and water for the streets will cost
$2000 per month, and that if the con
tract is entered into between the
Council and Nash & McÃeynolds
there will be no money which can law
fully be used to pay for the same.
Judge Kittridge granted a tempo
rary restraining order and cited all
parties to appear in court February
14 and show cause why a permanent
injunction should not be Issued re
straining them from granting the con
tract to Nash & Me Reynolds.
On January 19 the City Council,
composed of Councilmen Fay, Kreig,
Dittus and Nolting, passed a resolu
tion awarding Nash & MeÃeynolds a
three-year contract for sweeping the
streets. Five bids were received for
the work, but the Council singled out
that of Nash & McÃeynolds, the
highest of them all, and awarded the
contract to that firm. The bid of L.
Hewlett, over a third lower than Nash
& McÃeynolds', was thrown aside.
The Council claimed that Hewlett was
merely speculating in the matter and
therefore they would not give it to
him The two bids are as follows:
Nash & McÃeynoldsâ .oos2B2 cents per
Bquare yard per month, six times a week
for two-year contract; .002641 three times
a week. Two per cent discount for a con
tract for three years. m
L. Hewlettâ .oo397s cents per square
yard per month, six times a week, two
year contract; one-half of the above
amount for three times a wck, Two per
cent off for three-year contract.
By giving the contract to Nash &
McÃeynolds it was proposed to mulct
the city to the extent of $4000 per
year for three years. The old contract
was $595 per month, and it is said that
the bid submitted by Hewlett was
lower than this. Three years ago
Hewlett was given the contract and
he immediately sold it to Nash & Mc-
Reynolds, who pay him $75 per month
for it. Just who was to get the $4000
per year that the new contract was to
mulct the city of is the all-absorbing
question.
Mayor Koch refused to become a
party to looting the city treasury' to
the sum of $12,000 in the next three
years and vetoed the resolution. The
veto was filed late Tuesday night and
when the facts appeared exclusively
in The Call this morning the citizens
were unanimous in praise of that of
ficial's action.
THE SAy FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 4, 1898.
EX-JUDGE FINED
FOR CONTEMPT
I Insolence" of an Erratic
San Diego Attorney
Punished.
Judges Torrence and Hughes
Sustain the Dignity of the
Superior Court.
Scandalized, for Denying a Change, of
Venue in a Case Involving ' -
.Water Hates. "'i^
Â« .'
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN DIEGO, Feb. John D. Works,
Justice of the Supreme Court, was
adjudged guilty of contempt of court
S to-day . and fined $250. The circum
stances of the case were such as to
extremely provoke the two Judges of
â¢ the Superior Court, and while their
language was well curbed they did not
fail to make their displeasure felt.
The case of T. J. Higgins : et al. vs.
the City of San Diego and San Diego
; Water Company was under considera
| tion, and it relates to the question of
) water rates. The water company, rep
i resented by Judge Works, applied for
| a change of venue, alleging that the
two San Diego Judges, being consum
ers of water, are interested in the case
| and therefore disqualified. In support
! of this allegation the affidavit of J. M.
Howells, president of the San Diego
Water Company, was filed, in which
Howells declared, of his own knowl
edge, that application had been made
to secure a disinterested Judge and the
application denied.
Howells was called before the Judges
and he admitted that he knew nothing
of his own knowledge and that his af
fidavit was false in this respect. His
affidavit was prepared by Judge
Works, who caused Howells to sign.
In addition' to this offense Works in
dulged in criticism of Judge Torrence
in language scandalous and imperti
nent and repeated certain charges
against his integrity. These charges
had been previously made by Works in
a brief submitted to the Supreme Court
in a former case, and the Supreme
Court ordered the language: stricken
from the brief on the ground that it
was scandalous and impertinent. But
Works, nothing daunted, returned to
the charge .in Judge Torrence's own
court,, disregarding the hint given in
the Supreme Court that a repetition of
such an -offense might result in pun
ishment for contempt if not disbar
ment.
In court to-day Judge Torrence call
ed upon Works to explain this portion
of the affidavit. Works made an at
tempt at an explanation, saying that
he meant no offense and stating that
as Judge Torrence had met him on the
street and declined to speak to him he
| believed he had just cause for feeling
| that Judge Torrence was prejudiced
against him. Judges Tocrence and
Hughes, who were sitting in bank in
the case, conferred for a time and then
j announced that ex-Judge Works was
I guilty of, contempt and that he be fined
I $250. In the order the Judges say:
"The court finds that' the said John D.
Works, by incorporating â in said affi
davit of said J. M. Howells the state
ment therein contained last above re
cited and presenting and : reading the
same to the court, Intended thereby to
â¢show his disrespect to the court and
especially, to the Judge of Department
1 of this court: (Torrence) . and . improp
erly influence the decision to be made
by the court -upon the motion present
ed by him as aforesaid."
SAN DIEGO'S CITY
CLERK IN TROUBLE
SAN DIEGO, Feb. 3.â George Wilbur,
City Clerk of Oceanside, is in trouble.
His office is in the hands of Constable
Myers, and an expert, B. F. Whiting,
has been engaged to go over Wilbur's
books. It is alleged that Wilbur is
about $1000 short in his accounts. The
finance committee of the Board of
Trustees is in charge of the investiga
tion, â¢which promises something start
ling. One or two other city officials,
it is said, are trembling. Some of Wil
bur's friends claim that the whole mat
ter is a political conspiracy to prevent
his re-election to the office.
LETTER FROM
JOHN CLARK
Brother of the Fratricide
Asks for Full Infor
mation.
The Murderer Has a Violent
Attack of Illness in
His Cell.
He Is Visited by Salvationists, Who
Pray for Him While He
Weeps.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NAPA, Feb. 3.â A letter to Dr. Os
borne of St. Helena has arrived from
John Clark, a brothet- of the now fa
mous fratricide, George Clark. The
missive is penned at the home of the
father of the Clarks, in Wayne County,
Illinois, and asks the doctor to send full
particulars of the revolting crime.
From the tenor of the letter it is in
ferred that the writer had less affec
tion for George than lor the murdered
brother. Nothing is said of contribut
ing funds for the murderer's defense.
The letter simply says that the writer
had seen brief accounts of the crime
in Eastern papers, which was the
extent of what he knew of the affair.
George Clark was terribly ill in his
cell yesterday, and the county physi
cian had to be called. He is better to
day. This morning Captain N. Evan
son and Lieutenant Charles Baker of
the Salvation Army at St. Helena and
Captain W. A. Vandyke of the Napa
corps held services with the prisoner.
When they emerged from jail they
were questioned.
"We prayed and Clark went," said
Captain Evanson. "I must say that I
believe him guilty. God pity him! He
says to me, 'I know the Lord has for
given me for all my sins.' Then he
quoted from the Scripture, 'Though thy
sins be as scarlet they shall be made
white as snow.' "
"Of course he is guilty," continued
the captain. "He confessed to that last
week, though he is now half claiming to
be innocent. Why he partially confessed
to Captain Vandyke before he did to
any one else. From his general man
ner and conversation to us, at least,
he practically confesses all the time.
To-day he seems to be almost col
lapsed. He does not seem to care for
anything. He realizes his fate and
says he doesn't mind death only he
doesn't want to die by the rope. I
said to him, 'George, at the last mo
ment do you want me to be there?'
and he answered, with a sob, 'I do.' "
Saturday is the day set for pleading.
NO AMERICAN FLAG
ON THE MEDITERRANEAN
Orders Issued for the Flagship San
Francisco and Gunboat Bancroft
to Go to Lisbon.
NEW YORK. Feb. 3.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs;
Orders have been issued to the San
Francisco, flagship of the European
squadron, and the gunboat Bancroft, to
proceed to Lisbon, Portugal. Their de
parture from the Mediterranean will
leave that eea for the first time In three
years without a vessel flying the Ameri
can flag. Affairs in Turkey are now so
quiet that the administration has deter
mined that there is no further need for
an American vessel in the eastern part
of the Mediterranean. Orders were sent
to the Bancroft several weeks ago direct
ing her to proceed to Genoa, Italy. She
arrived there several days ago, being
joined soon afterward by the flagship
San Francisco. I understand that orders
directing the departure of the squadron
for Lisbon were to po Into effect imme
diately after Commodore J. W. Howell
succeeded Rear Admiral T. O. Selfridgo'
as commander In chief of the European
station. This took place yesterday morn
ing. The Helena has been at Lisbon for
two weeks.

MAGIC IN THE
NAME OF HANNA
How a Santa Rosan's
Pension Claim Got
a Boost.
A First Cousin of the Ohio Sen
ator Will Soon Receive
His Dues.
Department Red Tape Temporarily-
Suspended Through Influence
That Counted.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA ROSA, Feb. 3.â The theory
that there is nothing in a name was
shown to be an erroneous one by a lit
tle circumstance that took place here
to-day. The details of the case show
conclusively that there is considerable
in some names, especially when they
begin with "H" and are spelled Hanna.
Some three or four years ago Cassius B.
Hanna filed an application with the
Pension Bureau asking that he be
placed upon the pension roll. He served
throughout the war under Sherman,
took part in the memorable march to
the sea, and as colonel of his regiment
led the celebrated charge across the
river and into the graveyard down in
Tennessee â the time the One Hundred
and Third Ohio was devoting a little
attention to General Hood â and he sup
posed, of course, that it would not take
long for the Pension Department to at
tend to his claim and place his name
where it belonged.
Almost four years rolled around,
however, and nothing was heard of the
matter. Two weeks ago Hanna, who
is a first cousin of Mark Hanna, United
States Senator from Ohio, grew tired
of waiting and wrote to his cousin,
asking him to try to hurry things along
a bit. By the return mail, which ar
rived last night, came a big batch of
legal documents from the department.
The whole matter had been arranged,
and forms that usually require seven
or eight months at the least to be gone
through with had been so attended to
that all that was necessary was an ex
amination by the physicians and the
attachment of a few signatures to com
plete the matter.
With the documents came a letter
from Senator Hanna, saying that he
had spoken to the head of the Pension
Bureau concerning the matter and that
It would be attended to without delay.
Hanna was examined to-day, the sig
natures were duly affixed and no doubt
about next week a nice check wifi come
this way, and all because his name is '
Hanna.
MRS. ALSIP SHOWS A
NOBLE DISPOSITION.
SACRAMENTO. Feb. 3.â The Bee
â will publish to-night the announcement
that Mrs. E. K. Alsip, wife of the miss
ing real estate dealer, has transferred
to an assignee all of the property con
veyed to her by her husband before
his departure. Mrs. Alsip does this
unequivocally, for the purpose of
wiping out her husband's Indebted
ness. The property will be sold from
time to time and the money applied to
the purpose she has designed. It is be
lieved that this action will enable all
unsecured creditors of Alsip to get
their money in full. The property con
sists of half a dozen town blocks and
land in Sacramento and Placer coun
ties.
The stockholders of the Union Build
ing and Loan Association, which is in
financial trouble, made worse by the
disappearance of its secretary, Ed
win K. Alsip, met this evening to talk
matters over and try and find out
where they are at. A committee was
appointed to wait on all the creditors
TRICING THE
MANY CHECKS
Chemical National Bank
Trying to Realize on
Grable's Paper.
Directors Anxious to Recover
Some of the Money Loaned
by Quinlan.
Enormous Enterprises in the West
in Which Many Financiers Are
Entangled.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Feb. 3.â John S. Silver,
one of the men \vhqse borrowing from
the Chemical Bank led to the resigna
tion of Director and Cashier Quinlan,
said to-day that he did not owe as
much as he had been said to owe, but
whatever the sum was he would pay it.
The officers of the Chemical National
Bank were in communication by tele
graph with banks in various parts of
the country to trace the course of the
certified checks given by Cashier Quin
lan to Messrs. Silver and Grable, and
to ascertain whether financial institu
tions elsewhere had advanced money
on drafts such as were accepted as se
curity at the Chemical National Bank.
The directors of the bank were in ses
sion all to-day discussing means of re
covering as much as may be possible
of the money loaned by Mr. Quinlan.
President Williams of the Chemical
National Bank, when shown a dis
patch from St. Louis containing an in
terview with Grable, in which the lat
ter said that Mr. Williams had been a
stockholder in one of his companies for
several years, said: "It is wrong for
this man to try to mix me up in his
schemes. It Is true that I have been
connected with one of his companies,
but It was a trifling matter, not more
than two or three thousand dollars."
He also admitted the truth of a state
ment that on Thursday last the Chem
ical National Bank had accepted a de
mand note of ?201,501 from Grable,
agreeing at the same time not to press
Grable for the money.
William H. Kurtz, who is said to
have beeen associated with Grable in
many of his deals, said to-day: "Mr.
Grable's dealings with the Chemical
National Bank have extended over a
considerable period. As I understand
from him, he was wHI known to all
the bank's officials. To my knowledge
he owed the bank $170,000 at one time
and liquidated the debt until only $19,
000 was left. Thus he has gone on con
tracting obligations and discharging
them. At the beginning of last week
the total amount of Grable's indebted
ness to the bank was $201,500."
Judge F. M. Hamer of Kearney,
Nebr., who was said to be Mr. Grable's
counsel, said that Grable began his bus
iness life as a bank clerk in Kearney
and then branched out as a money
lender and real estate dealer in Lin
coln, where he prospered. Judge Ha
mer said that Grable had never failed
in any of his enterprises. He said
that if Grable had not been pressed he
could have easily paid off his present
indebtedness to the Chemical National
Bank. Grable's Western companies.
Judge Hamer said, were all in a pros
perous condition. Judge Hamer said
he supposed Grable's property, if real
ized on, would bring $1,000,000 over and
above Mr. Grable's total indebtedness.

AN ASININE BOODLER.
IN its latest attempt to secure another "advertis
ing" contract from the railroad monopoly the
Mission street Boodler is entitled to the sym
pathy of all tender-hearted people. The Boodler
thought it had the monopoly in the door on the fen
der question, and its editor rushed out to the police
court and swore to a warrant for the arrest of H. E.
Huntingdon under an ordinance which is not in
operation. This has not disturbed the railroad at
all. The Boodler has merely succeeded in laying its
editor liable in civil damages for malicious arrest and
itself open to an action for libel, besides convincing
the public that it is an ass of the first magnitude.
Then in order to carry out its desperate programme
of getting on the railroad payroll whether or no, the
Boodler took up the cause of Supervisors Delany,
Haskins, Devany and Rivers, members of the Com
mittee on Health and Police, who are responsible for
the delay in adopting a fender. For several days the
Boodler has been loud in its defense of these officials,
while soundly berating the Market Street Company
for not equipping its cars with a fender in defiance
of the law. In its frantic efforts to put itself right be
fore the public and dissipate the universal impres
sion that its crusade is only a campaign for another
'"advertising" contract, the Boodler has converted it
self into a veritable journalistic comedian. Now it is
howling daily about lenders, ordinances, electric cars,
Attorney-Generals, Governor Budds, warrants and
Huntingtons, without either system or coherence.
I? we did not know that the Boodler was always a
brainless donkey we should fear for its sanity.
There is nothing truer than that when a man
weaves a tangled web of fraud and deceit he soon be
comes enmeshed in his own lie?. The Boodler
started the fender fight with a corrupt motive. It did
not desire the public good. It wanted to put Hun
tington in a "hole" because he will not "advertise"
in it. So it proceeded on an inoperative ordinance
and told a whole lot of falsehoods about fenders and
electric cars. Like all numskulls who play with tools
which can be handled successfully only by grown-up,
intelligent men, the Boodler has simply fallen into
the mire of its own idiocy.
The Call hesitates to pursue this subject further,
because we understand there is a law. moral if not
statutory, against ridiculing fools. We are. indeed,
sorry for the Boodler. We are especially sorry for
it in this fender question. If it is so important that
it shall get another "advertising" contract, why does
it not put in an application in the proper way and
offer to shut up about the railroad monopoly? It has
no moral right to inflict its idiocy upon its readers
in a futile attempt to compel the corporation to "ad
vertise." It is our opinion, foolish as the Boodler is,
that the railroad, if properly petitioned, would pay a
little something for its silence.
The arrest of a mate for cruelty to sailors has taken '
place at Portland As usual, the sailors are held in
jail as witnesses and doubtless the accused will give
bail with comfortable promptness. One of the pen
alties of being a sailor is. apparently, to get beaten,
and the penalty of complaining about this is to get
the punishment which ought to go to the original
offender.
Murderer Clark says he bears no ill-will toward
any one, which is a noble sentiment and ought to have
been cultivated while he still had possession of a
gun.
Possibly Secretary Alger ha; been worried into ill
ness by the fear that the harbor at San Pedro will be
built despite his conscientious scruples against it.
There is no doubt that Vining's material for a
private graveyard is enough to make an imposing

OUR COMMERCIAL INTEREST IN
GERMANY.
7^ HE news from Germany is disagreeable. Cali
fornia had just opened the way in that empire
for American fruit. Our exhibit at the food
show in Hamburg was followed by a steady and in
creasing demand for American fruit. German deal
ers were represented here by buyers who were fairly
skinning the market of its stock. In the midst of
this activity appears an arbitrary prohibition of im
ports which cuts off apples, pears and all fresh fruits
entirely, and may readily exclude also all dried fruit,
the form in which our trade promised the best results.
We have a commercial treaty with Germany
whereby we are guaranteed the same advantage in
her markets which is accorded to the most favored
nation. Under this treaty each nation may establish
such revenue regulations, by tariff, as it chooses. It
may put its tariff rate on any given article or class
of articles at a prohibitory point if it chooses. But
neither nation may exclude the products of the other
by subterfuge and indirection. This is done by Ger
many when she excludes our meats and fruits on
pretended sanitary grounds. To answer the de
mands of her agrarians Germany excluded our pork
under pretense that it was commonly affected by
trichina. Against this exclusion we could show the
almost entire immunity of our pork-eating people
from the disease caused by that parasite, but this
made no impression upon the German Government.
It desired to get around its treaty and avoid punish
ment for violating the favored nation clause, and so
it stubbornly insisted upon this exclusion for sanitary
reasons. Even after our Government had established
a rigid scientific inspection of all meats for export
Germany flouted the efficiency of the inspection and
in a high-handed way impeached the good faith not
only of the exporter, but of the Government itself.
At the same time that this was going on England
was taking largely of our pork products, packed in
the same way and by the same houses, and her peo
ple consumed them to their advantage and without any
evil results. In the same way England is to-day
taking our fresh, dried and tinned fruits, and with
a scientific inspection of all her food products that
is not excelled by that of Germany finds no reason
for refusing them on sanitary grounds.
It is noteworthy that Germany does not put up
these bars to the trade of any other nation. If she
did it by her tariff it must act equally against all the
countries with which she has commercial relations.
This she does not wish to do. She desires to take
and hold an attitude of hostility toward the United
States, to single out our people for her resentment,
without injuring her standing with any other.
It is time to end the game of false pretenses under
which this policy has been pursued by that nation.
The American people were badly impressed recently
by the information that the American Minister to
Berlin was treated with such conspicuous disrespect
that it had become the subject of diplomatic pro
test. Our Minister was compelled to the statement
that he could endure the snubs and slights put upon
him as an individual, but did not propose to treat
them patiently when they were offered in his official
character.
There has been nothing in the attitude of the
United States toward Germany to provoke insults to
our Minister or discrimination against our trade, and
it is time that both cease or that diplomatic and com
mercial intercourse cease until that Government im
proves its sense of respect for its treaty obligations
and for other members of the family of nations.
The most impartial and unimpassioned representa
tions should be made to Germany, with no hint of
anything beyond amicsble protest, and if patient ef
fort on that line fail to improve the situation, it will
be proper to make it plain that this is not China and
the policy which forced the Tsung Li Yamen to dis
graceful submission is not of general application.
A QUESTION OF ANARCHY.
UNDER the heading "Anarchism in San Fran
cisco" the St. Louis Post-Dispatch moans
over one of the most noted movements of our
civic life; declaring that it tends to weaken govern
ment and is subversive of republican institutions.
It describes the movement as an example of philo
sophical anarchism, and advises us to battle with it at
once or prepare to meet the worst.
It will surprise our readers to learn that the authors
of the anarchy are the members of the Merchants'
Association, and that the anarchical movement itself
was the enterprise that resulted in having some of our
streets kept clean and well lighted by voluntary con
tributions.
The argument of the Post- Dispatch is that any
movement on the part of a voluntary association of
private citizens to perform work that ought to be
done by the Government is a tendency toward an
archy. It is a substitution of the individual will for
the public will, and it weakens all government by
causing the people to rely upon voluntary actions and
contributions for public improvements instead of pro
viding them through the machinery of the organized
municipality.
According to this view of the case, the sweeping
and lighting of the streets by an association of pri
vate citizens was in the nature of lynch law. It was
a violation of the established order of society, and
was virtually an act by which certain determined men
set the government aside and executed something
with promptness which otherwise would not have
been executed at all.
There is an element of reason in this argument, k
is not advisable that a people should ever be led to
rely upon private action to perform work which
ought to be done by the people as a whole. It fares
ill with a community that waits for a millionaire to
give it a public library or a park or to provide any
other work necessary to the general good. The best
communities are those all of whose institutions and
undertakings essential to the general welfare are car
ried out by the people themselves at the public ex
pense through the established government.
It does not follow from this, however, that volun
tary action in matters of public concern tends to
anarchy. Such movements as that so well carried out
by the Merchants' Association in this city serve
rather to advance municipal government by exhibit
ing to the people object lessons of what could be ac
complished by municipal authority if wisely directed
and energetically employed. â¢ San Francisco has
learned from the action of her merchants what can
be done in the way of street improvements of all
kinds, and as a result her government in this respect
has been distinctly better than before. It would in
deed be gratifying to have more object lessons of
that kind. He that calls them anarchy is himself an
anarchist.
It seems that the family of Henry George was not
left destitute, and there was certainly no reason wh}'
it should have been. Genius ought to be certain of
at least the reward constituted by the ability to make
a decent living.
THE SAIST FRAXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 4, 1898
MAKE READY FOR THE CANVASS.
IT is full time for the Republicans of California to
begin making ready for the coming political cam
paign. The Democratic State Central Commit
tee has already held a meeting and started activity in
the ranks of that party. Republicans cannot afford
to be idle when the enemy is at work. The day
when the contest will open briskly all along the line
is not so far distant as to make the preliminary
work of organization at present either premature or
untimely.
As the dominant party in the nation and in the
State, it devolves upon the Republicans to take the
initiative in every step of the campaign. The party
in power must shape the issue to be submitted to the
country. It must take the leadership at the start or
lose prestige with the people. A party charged with
the administration of the Government cannot afford
to wait and leave it to the opposition to decide what
questions shall be put to the front in the canvass
and what measures shall be made the dominant fac
tors of the contest at the polls.
The appeal recently issued from the State League
of Republican Clubs calling on the Republicans of
every county to organize clubs to co-operate with the
league during the campaign deserves a prompt re
sponse from the party at large. This is the time to
begin such organizations. The sooner .the party gets
into ranks the quicker will all its members feel the
thrill of the coming contest and the more efficient
will they be for the performance of the arduous
work required of them when the campaign opens ac
tively and the battle becomes hot and furious.
It is too soon, of course, to fix a definite date for
the assembling of the State convention, but it is not
too soon to decide that it shall be called compara
tively early. On the part of the Republicans this is
to be a campaign of education. They will have
specific measures to defend and to some extent these
will not be understood by the people until they have
been explained by the press and from the stump.
That work ought not to be postponed too long. In
fact the party should be ready to take the field as
soon as Congress adjourns and the record of Re
publican legislation is made up for submission to the
voters.
California is not "a yellow dog" State. It is Re
publican in principles, sentiment and policy, but it
demands of the Republican party unswerving fidelity
and untiring energy- in the performance of public
duties. It does not bestow victory as a favor on the
party at any time, but holds it up as a high and noble
prize to be won by merit. Because that truth was
overlooked in times past the Republicans of Califor
nia have qjet many defeats, and at this time, with a
Legislature strongly Republican, there is a Demo
cratic Governor at Sacramento, and our industries
are misrepresented by five free traders to only four
Republican protectionists in Congress.
There must be no mistakes this year. The Re
publican party is in this campaign to support great,
broad principles and far-reaching measures of na
tional importance. It must have brainy, broad
minded, vigorous, full-blooded men to represent it.
This is the time to get the energies of the party
started. Activity aroused now will mean enthusiasm
when the battle begins.
IT is significant of the extent to which the Klon
dike excitement has affected the Eastern States
that the stocks of all railways likely to obtain a j
large share of the travel westward ha\c advanced con- j
siderab'y on the strength of the incrci?ed trade they !
are expected to receive. In such papers as the Wall
Street News these roads are referred to as "the Klon
dike group," and the announcement is made that all
of them are booming.
The financial editor of the New York Tribune at- |
tributes much of what he calls "the sensational ad
vance" in the bon.ds of the Seattle and Eastern Road :
to a contest for control, but says the upward move
ment in all the northern lines is due largely to the
"Klondike craze" and its effect upon the public mind.
He quotes reports to the Secretary of War as in
dicating that 200,000 people will go to Alaska this
year, and concedes that estimates of a large business
for the Klondike group of roads are well justified.
The Wall Street News in discu^ing the rapid rise
in the shares says that at present it is based upon an
ticipation only, but adds that the Northwestern rail
ways have spent a great deal of time and money in
an effort to approximate the extent of the Klondike
rush this year, and concludes. "If only a fair part of
their expectations are realized the shares of all roads
running to the Pacific Coast are selling very low."
The Tribune estimates that the abnormally large
rush for Alaska will continue for at least two years,
but argues that the vast extent of the Alaskan gold
districts and the richness of the placers thus far dis
covered promise a permanent trade of great propor
tions. It is pointed out that the difficulties which
have confronted the Alaskan miners in the past will
be diminished with each succeeding year as the facili
ties for obtaining supplies increase, and that con
sequently the development of the country will go
steadily forward so that even if the rush falls off after
next year the trade of the region in supplies of all
kinds is likely to grow in magnitude for years to
come.
Wall street is not always a safe guide to follow. It
has its temporary aberrations as well as the rest of
the country. Nevertheless, when it is so sanguine of
a great trade and business in a particular direction
as to put up the millions of money necessary to ad
vance the stocks and shares of a whole group of rail
roads it may be accepted as a very good indication
that a good basis exists for the bull movement.
In a sparsely settled country like the Pacific Coast
we do not feel the Klondike excitement as it is felt
in the crowded East, where the intending prospectors
of the new gold fields are counted not by hundreds,
but by thousands. Wall street is in the center of the
excitement in the East and knows what is coming.
As the Tribune says, "it may be imagined what earn
ings the companies which handle the bulk of the
Alaska trade will make this year and what a perma
nent trade is opened to them. Supplies for 200.000
people must average over a ton each, and all has to
be carried in."
Live flshes are ordinarily transported in cans, de
signed for the purpose, and made of different sizes.
If necessary the water in these cans is aerated by
dlpping it up and letting: it fall again through the air
into the can. Sometimes the water is aerated by
pumping from one can to another with a pump made
for the purpose. In cars especially designed for the
transportation of living fishes, as. for example, those
of the United States Fish Commission, a constant
circulation of water is maintained. The young salmon
recently received at the New York aquarium from
the commission's station at Green Lake. Me., came
through in such a car. It is fitted with tanks. There
is carried under the car f.oor a reservoir of water,
which is pumped into a supply lank above, whence it
runs down into the tanks containing the fishes, over
flowing into the reservoir below. It is practically an
aquarium on wheels.â New York Sun

GOOD THINGS IN NEXT SUNDAY'S CALL
Summon a man from a distant land to appear before you in a few hours?
Bosh you will say.
But that is just what several adepts claim to have done in a meeting of
occults across the bay. Of course the man who was summoned did not ap
pear in his every-day body, but in its "counterfeit presentment." How these
adepts met and why they permitted a novice to visit the meeting and the
strange scenes that took place there are all set forth
IN NEXT SUNDAY'S CALL.
In France a discovery has just been made that promises to save millions
of dollars annually to that country. It is a way to destroy the phylloxera,
that deadly post of the grape vine. So anxious were the French to discover
a remedy for this evil that a reward of $300,000 was offered. The pest is rap
idly destroying the non-resistant vines in this State as well, and a loss of
millions of dollars is threatened. California winemakers, as well as the
French nation, are deeply interested in this discovery. So important and so
certain of effect does the new remedy seem that the French Academy and
the leading specialists of this country have taken it up.
Read what they say about it in next Sunday's Call.
Missionaries meet with strange adventures in China, but a woman mis
sionary, working all by herself in a section of the empire rarely penetrated

day's Call she relates the queer sights she saw among the Olestials and the
odd customs that prevail ia their home life.
A notorious confidence operator, a merchant in "gold bricks' and such
ware^ a man who has been hunted by the police of nearly half the States
in the Union has just been netted here by the law. Time and again he was

A VERY
DOUBTFUL
COMPLIMENT.
OCOOOOOOOO r a cy ' he had be .
come so critical on matters of dress,
form and speech that there was nothing
in his native California that had his com
plete approval. Yet the feeling that he
entertained for his benighted fellow be
ings, who had never been over two or
three thousand miles from their homes,
was rather one of compassion than con
demnation. He pitied their* unfortunate
ignorance and never allowed an opportun
ity to pa?s without endeavoring to cor
rect It. Strange as it may seem, this
young gentleman's kindly attempts to
polish off the rough edges on some of the
old nuggets of the days of '49 were not
always received in the proper spirit; la
fact, some of the hardest cases that he
tried to bring under the influence of his
transatlantic refinement have been heard,
after his departure, to commune with
themselves in terms not generally heard
in the best society.
The other day a party of business men
was sitting at lunch in the Palace Grill
when their circle was added to and orna
mented by the advent or this young scion
of nineteen centuries and one generation,
who drew up his chair to the table, and,
regardless of the business discussion that
was going on, proceeded to hold, forth on
his favorite topic to the exclusion of all
other conversation. The rest o* the party
listened with ill-concealed impatience un
j til one of them broke In with: "Say, old
man, you know I was once in England
myself. I met some delightful people
there. One of them in particular. Lord X..
was, I think, the most thorough and per

"What is that?" asked the surprised
and delighted young anglomaniac.
"The complete difference," replied the
first speaker.
It took some time for the full signifi
cance of the answer to soak in, but when
it did there was a sudden rustling of
chairs heralding the abrupt departure oX

M. J- Ryan, the Lowest Bidder
for a Garbage Contract,
Overlooked.
FINDS A REMEDY IN COURT
Although Without the Limits of the
Favored' Circle He Gains
His Point.
The Board of Supervisors has been
brought up with a jerk in its endeavor
to fellow in the footsteps of the Har-
bor Commission and award contracts,
not to trie lowest bidder, but to the one
\\h<>m it is better pleased to please.
Behind, the illegal attempt of the Su
pervisors to award a contract calling
tor almost double the sum asked by a
bidder who chanced to be without the
limits of the favored circle no gigantic
scandal exists, but there is implied in
the action either a determination on the
part of the Supervisors to assist them
selves, or, as can be deducted from cir
cumstances, an immediate friend, or an
undeniable desire to violate the provi
sions e-f the law now in existence for
their government.
Judge Seawell yesterday decided that
the Supervisors had no right to award
contracts for the performance of any
labor to any person but the lowest bid
der. The decisicm was reached in the
action of M. J. Ryan against the Board
of Supervisors for an injunction re
straining it from awarding a contract
to P. J. Carroll for the removal of dirt,
ashes and rubbish from the County
Jail, jail yards, City Prison, City Halls,
City and County Ho-spitals, public
buildings and public squares.
Un December 6 the Supervisors ad
vertised for bids for the labor men
tioned, and on the 13th inst. they were
tipened. M. J. Ryan was the lowest
bidder, $169 a month being his figure;
and P. J. Carroll required $300 a month
before he would undertake the labor in
volved to carry out the contract.
On December 20, notwithstanding the
great difference between the figures of
the bidders, Carroll was awarded the
contract. Subsequently an order was
prepared and drafted awarding the
contract to Carroll and the bids of
Ryan and several contractors were re
â  jt-cted. Ryan immediately declared
that the law had been violated. He
tiled suit, asking that the board be en
joined from awarding the contract to
: â¢â¢â¢11, and notwithstanding the vari
ous excuses advanced by the defendant
a decision was handed down in his fa
}| r. All that now remains for him to
r in order to get the co-ntract is to file
an approved undertaking in the sum of
$500, as required by law, to pay for the
advertising and as a surety that he will
carry out the provisions of the con
tract. The opinion of Judge Seawell
on granting the injunction as prayed
for by Ryan is as follows:
I will state briefly the conclusions at
â which I have arrived on this motion.
There is no controversy as to the re
quirements of the law governing the
awiard of contracts by the defendants.
They must be lÂ»t to the lowest bidder.
As <\irroli was not the lowest bidder the
contract which defendants intend (as al
leged i to enter Into with him would be
illegal and void. The law cannot be
evaded by any neglect of defendants to
open all the bids. It is not therefore ma
terial whether all the bids mentioned in
the complaint were in fact opened.
Under the rule st.ited in Bradford vs
San Francisco I think that an action may
be maintained by a taxpayer to restrain
the defendants, not only from entering
into an illegal contract, but also from
passing an order awarding such a con
tract. True, the courts have no power to
control thp legislative discretion of the
Board of Supervisors: but upon the sub
ject of the award of contracts to the low
est bidder they have no discretion what
ever. If they make any award at all it
must be to the lowest bidder. Upon the
Keneral proposition that the legislative
body of a municipal corporation may be
Restrained from incurring an illegal obli
gation there seems to be no conflict of
authority.
It is alleged in the complaint that de
fendants intend to and will, unless re
strained by this court, pass an order
awarding the contract to Carroll, and will
also enter into a contract with him
While no express threat as to the inten â¢
tions of the defendants is alleged, it is
averred that they have prepared the or
der which they intend to pass, and also
the form of contract for Carroll to sign.
I think that the allegations of these
preparations, in connection with those
stating the Intentions of defendants,
JÂ£ uch are not denied, are sufficient to
Tf .-tify plaintiff in applying to the court
t- restrain the defendants from passing
the order and awarding the contract.
An injunction will issue as prayed upon
plaintiff filing an approved undertaking In
the sum of $500.

TWO OF THE FERRY STEAMERS CRASH TOGETHER IN THE FOG.
The Piedmont Lost Her Way and While Looking ior the- Broad-Gauge Landing Ran Into
the Garden City.
Both Steamers Smashed Their Forward Rudders and Aprons and Their Forward Upperworks.
THE ferry-boat Piedmont got lost
in the fog yesterday morning,
and while Captain Jones was
vainly looking for his landing
place on the Oakland side he
found the creek boat Garden City, and
ran his vessel into her. The two steam
ers collided nearly end on and almost
a panic ensued among the passengers.
The rudder and forward part of each
boat were completely wrecked and it
will be at least a month before either
will be ready for service again. In the
general smash-up among the trucks
and freight wagons on the lower deck
of the Garden City, P. M. Partridge,
a painter of Oakland, was seriously in
jured and was removed to the Harbor
Receiving Hospital when the vessel
reached this side.
The Piedmont left San Francisco at 8
a. m., in charge of Captain Jones, and
the Garden City left the foot of Broad
way, Oakland, at the same hour, In
charge of Captain Fredrickson. In
stead of picking up Goat Island on his

BEATS WIFE
AND CHILDREN
D. C. Vanier, a Salesman,
Is Again Under
Arrest.
On the First Occasion He Suc
cessfully Played the Insanity
Dodge.
His Wife Fled From Him "Yesterday
as She Was Afraid He Would
Kill Her.
D. C. Vanier, a salesman, who was
arrested some months ago on co-mplaint
of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children, for brutally beat
ing his little girl, is again under ar
rest, the sufferer on this occasion from
his violence being his wife, a delicate
looking little woman.
On the previous occasion there was
no doubt as to the cruelty to the child
as her body bore striking evidence of
the fact, but Vanier played the insan
ity dodge and to all questions ag to
why he beat the child so brutally, he
replied, "The Lord told me to do it."
He was arraigned before Judge Low,
! but the Judge deemed it advisable to
send him before the Insanity Commis-
I sioners. The commissioners did not
think him insane enough to be sent to
an asylum, and he had to stand trial \
in the Police Court. He demanded a
jury trial, and so conducted himself in
court that the jury, after two hours'
deliberation, brought in a verdict of
net guilty on the ground that he was
not exactly responsible for his ac- ,
tions.
Vanier placed all the blame for his
srrest upon his wife, and since then
he has been abusing and beating her
until yesterday she could stand it no
longer, as she was afraid of her life,
so she complained to Colonel Parnell of
the society, who conducted the previous
case against her husband. She was
sent to friends in Oakland to get her
oat of his way, and as the colonel re
ceived a telephone message from the
neighbors that Vanier was acting in a
very violent manner he went to Chief
Lees and asked the assistance of two
policemen in arresting him.
Policemen P. Coleman and McAuliff
were detailed to help the colonel, and
when they reached the house in the
rear of 1113 Jc-nes street they found Va- i
nitr storming around the place. He
subsided when he saw the two officers
and waited quietly at the patrol box :
until the wagon arrived to take him to
the City Prison, where he was charged
with battery upon his wife, the com- j
plaining witness being the colonel, who â 
says that Mrs. Vanier's body is cov
ered with black and blue marks from
the beatings she has received from her
husband.
The two children are being cared for
by the neighbors. After his experi
â¢PM in the Police Court Vanier care
fully refrained from venting his rage j
upon them.

the Narraw Gauge Oakland slip. The
Piedmont was put about and was mak
ing her way along the shore to the
broad-gauge landing when the Garden
City came out of the creek. The steam
ers were not ten feet apart when the
lookouts gave the warning, and then
all that could be done was to reverse
the engines, but it was too late to avert
the collision.
P. M. Partridge, the injured man, In
talking about the matter yesterday,
said that Captain Fredrickson did
everything in his power to prevent a
collision. From the moment the ship
cleared the mouth of the creek the en
gines were slowed down to half speed
and the fog-whistle was blown every
minute. The second mate and four of
the deckhands were on the lookout on
the steamer's bow, and the captain and
first mate were in the pilot-house. No
body saw the Piedmont till she was
right on top of the Garden City; then
the men on the lookout threw up their
hands in warning and ran for their
lives.

company with a number of others when
the shock came," said Mr. Partridge.

CORONER'S INQUESTS.
The Jury Passed Upon Several Cases
of Violent and Accidental Death
Within the Past Week.
The Coroner's jury inquiring into the
cause of the death of Robert Johnson, a
sailor who was found in bed with a re
volver bullet through his liver and a pis
tol on a table beside him, returned a ver
dict yesterday to the effect that the
wound was inflicted by a party or parties
unknown. Coroner Hawkins refused to
sign the verdict for the reason that two
of the witnesses had sworn that when
Johnson was asked at the Receiving Hos
pital whether he shot himself he nodded
in the affirmative.
In the case of Luke McDonald, who
jumped off the steamer Encinal and was
drowned, the verdict was suicide while
insane.
The jury charged Charles Weathers
with the murder of Nathan Phillips, whom
Weathers %hot In the Empire dive a few
days ago.
In the case of Baldwin Gardiner the
jury returned a verdict to the effect that
the fatal shot had been fired by some
person unknown to the jury. Patrol
Driver Murphy testified that i.c" fired over
Burglar Stroh's head and that the bullet
could not have struck Gardiner because
he was not in a line with it.
SHOT TO KILL
HIS ADVERSARY
John Gorman Fires Five Shots
at William Black, His
Brother-in-Law.
The Latter First Attacked Him With
a Knife and He Retaliated With
a Revolver.
John Gorman, a Grant-avenue saloon
keeper, fired five shots last night at Wil
liam Black, his brother-in-law. Three of
the bullets took effect, one striking the
man in the left arm, another taking off
the lower portion of the right ear and the
third striking him in the chin, making a
superficial wound. The shooting occurred
at 2219 Mission street.
According to Black's story he went to
the house where the shooting took place
to look for his wife, who had threatened
to desert him. As he entered he was met
by Gorman, who started to eject him.
Black drew a knife and ordered Gorman
to let him pass. Just then the latter
opened fire on his adversary, and as he
fell Gorman continued shooting at him.
Gorman was arrested immediately and
locked up at the Seventeenth-street Sta
tion on a charge of assault to commit
murder.
About a year ago Black got into trouble
with a relative named Morrison over his
wife and tired two shots at him, one of
which took effect in the ' right arm. The
knife which Black attempted,: to use. on
Gorman was found a few feet away from
the scene of the shooting.

The Piedmont also lost her forward
rudder, nearly all of the forward upper
works and part of her starboard
paddlewheel. Each vessel was strewn
with wreckage, and for a short time
those on the Garden City thought the
Piedmont had gone down, as she had
disappeared from view. She was only

PICKPOCKETS
AT A FUNERAL
Frank Smith and Thomas
Costigan Work the
Crowd.
They Were Observed by Some
Hackmen and Roughly
Treated.
Both Were Arrested and a Charge of
Attempt at Grand Larceny Was
Placed Against Them.
A pickpocket is no respecter of per
sons nor of circumstances. A few
months ago one was caught operating
among the congregation of the First
Congregational Church, and yesterday
two were discovered working the
mourners at a funeral.
The services over the remains of the
late John Raddich, who was killed by
the cars in Oakland, were held yester
day afternoon In St. Brendan's Church
on Fremont and Harrison streets. A
large number of friends of the deceased
attended the services, and as they came
out of the church two well-known pick
pockets, Thomas Cc-stigun and Frank
Smith, got among the people. Costi
gan carried an overcoat over his arm
and he was observed by some hackmen
to insert his hand into the pockets of
several people under cover of the over
coat. The cry of "Look out for your
pockets" was raised and the hackmen
made a rush upon Costigan and Smith.
They were being handled rather
roughly by the hackmen when Police
man Bakulich, who was attending the
funeral, made his appearance and the
two pickpockets were placed under ar
rest. John O. Kane, proprietor of a
livery stable near the church, and Wil
liam Happ, 2226 Fifteenth street, told
Bakulich that they saw Costigan's
hand in the pockets of several people
and that they would appear as wit
nesses against them in court. Several
hackmen will also appear against them.
They were taken to the City Prison and
a charge of attempt at grand larceny
was booked against them.
Costigan is credited by the police
with being one of the cleverest pick
pockets in the city. February 1 last
year he and Smith were arrested for
stealing a diamond pin from Frank
Phillips, a horseman, while on an elec
tric car coming from the Ingleside race
track. They were handed over to an
officer at Twenty-ninth and Mission
streets, and when searched the pin
could not be found. Costigan had it
in his mouth, and while he diverted
the officer's attention for a moment he
passed the pin to a friend who gave it
to Phillips with the request that he
should not appear against the two de
fendants. Phillips, however, appeared
in the Police Court and Costigan and
Smith were held to answer before the
Superior Court. They were tried in
Judge Dunne's court, but as Phillips
had gone East there was not sufficient
stopped backing and was just begin
ning to forge ahead, or else the Pied
mont would have crashed into her
the second time. Mr. Powell says the
foghorn on the Garden City kept up
such a constant din that he had to
give up trying to read his morning pa
per, and was pacing the lower deck
when the collision happened.
The Piedmont finally made her land
ing in the Oakland broad-gauge slip,
and after discharging her passengers
was laid off for repairs, the Newark
taking her place. Strange to say, on
her first trip toward Ran Francisco the
latter steamer also got lost in the fog,
and instead of making Market street
brought up off the foot of Spear street.
Then her captain brought her up
along the front and made three unsuc
cessful attempts before the vessel was
finally got into her slip.
The Garden City came on to San
Francisco, and after discharging Tier
passengers was taken over to Oak
land, where she was laid up alongside
of the Piedmont. The work of repair
ing the boats will be begun at once,
but it will be some time before either
of them is ready for service again, and

The big fleet which has been outside
for the past week got a slant of fair
wind yesterday and nearly all of the
vessels got in.
Among them was the British ship
Kate Thomas from Sydney. When out
a short time she got caught in a hur
ricane and was so badly damaged the
captain had to put back for repairs.
The British bark La Escoeesa, from
the nitrate ports; the barkentlne Irm

ships are outside, and their agents ex

the wind keeps in the right quarter.
The fog on the bay yesterday kept

spread, and on the next trip the fog
whistles had to be kept going from
slip to slip.
The Occidental and Oriental Com
pany's steamer Coptic got away for
Japan and China yesterday. She took
a large and valuable consignment of
cotton for the Japanese mills, and
a big lot of nails as ballast, but her
general cargo was light.
Still another vessel is being fitted out
for Kotzebue Sound. The barkentine
Leslie D (formerly the old whaling
bark Herriman) is being fitted out by
a party of. prospectors and will sail
next spring. There are about a dozen
men in the party, and no outsiders will
be taken along.

IS "PEELER"
ONE OF THE
"ATTERSONS"?
Simplicity in Bookkeeping
as Expounded by
Mr, Slade.
Daring "Doctoring" of More
Books to Shield the Board
of H ar "kor Commis
sioners.
Such an exhibition of effrontery and
moral obUqnlty as was presented be
fore Justice Belcher yesterday is rare
ly witnessed in a court of justice.
At the conclusion of the examination
of S. E. Slade, which took up the en
tire day, nc attendant at the trial of
the injunction case of the Parafflne
Paint Company asair.st the Harbor
Commissioners could have retired from
the courtroom with any belief other
than that in the record of the evidence
thus far presented is developed the
proof of bribery, corruption and fraud.
This civil action against the board
has assumed a countenance, in every
line of which is written culpability and
crime. The fact now stands out as
boldly as if confessed that the rascally
contract system, which the Dundon-
Slade-Laydon combine has fastened on
the State Board of Harbor Commis
sioners has been maintained by ini
aa methods brought home to the
commission, or to at least some mem
ber of it.
Collosicn and complicity are manifest
throughout the transactions between
the board and the Dundon clique.
The case has become a public griev
ance, demanding drastic red:- â
To point the force and effect of
r.y a brief review of the
antecedents is â Bi . The combi
n of contract jobbers has been
n presented by three organiza
tions, namely, the firm of Darby Lay
cL-n & Co. (Dundon partner), the Slade
Lumber Company (alleged by S'.ade to
s own), the San Francisco Tim
ber Preserving Company >a partnership
betf.> - and Dundon). Dundon
lea has an iron works doing bus
- with and through the three, con
cerns named.
The Siade Lumber Company and the
ler Preserving Company transact
business in the same office, and both
Beta ft flea are kept by Slade him
secretary of the Timber
Preserving Company, and runs the
Siade Lumber Company.
During- the year past the combina
tion has done business under a favored
contract fysterr. with the Harbor Corn
amounting to 5134.000. The Slade
Lumber Company supplied lumber
largely in excess of current prices.
Darby Laydon & Co. furnished logs I I
water-front improvements and repairs.
These were turned over to the San
Francisco Timber Preserving Company
for treatment with creosote. It is
charged that the whole number of piles
paid for by the board were not deliv
ered by Darby Laydon & Co. to the
T:rr.ber Preserving Company; that the
â¢whole number paid for as having been
creosoted by the Timber Preserving
- ir.y v, ~re rot treated, and that
the thefts thus connived at in both in
stances represented certain moneys
paid by the Harbor Commision and di
vided between the Dundon combine
ar.d the commission, or its representa
tives.
Positive record proof on this point
could be obtained only from what are
designated pile-books, which have dis
appeared. A former bookkeeper of
Darby Laydon A: Co. testified as to the
existence of the record and to the
practice cf theft.
A man named Patterson, former su
perintendent of construction and re
pairs for the commission, was alleged
to have received this partition money.
"When the Darby Laydon & Co. cash
book, journal and ledger were exam
in court numerous items were
found disclosing the payment of money
to persons indicated by the letters "at
terson." to which had be*m prefixed
recently the initials "M." "B" and
â¢"R." making the names read "Mat
terson." "Batterson" and "RatterÂ«on "
The bookkeeper, who testified to hav
ing made the substitution of initia's
ur.der instruction of Laydon. did not
know the persons thus named, but he
did know Superintendent Patterson,
and had seen him at the office of the
firm. He made other important era
sures intended to conceal any secret
transactions the firm might have had
with the Harbor Commission.
As a necessary link in the chain of
circumstantial evidence which was to
prove the theft of piles and. the pay
ment by the board for materials it had
never received it was necessary to tie
the fraudulent entries in the* Darby
Laydon books to some item or itemÂ« in
the records of the San Francisco Pre
serving Company. When their hodge
podge accounts were investigated yes
terday against the persistent remon
strance of Slade and his attorneys, it
was discovered that many sums of
money had been paid "to cash" in
checks, recorded either in the stubbs
or journal as having been drawn in
favor of "Peelers." In every Instance
save one where the record was found
a word had been erased recently; so
recently that the fur and fuzz stood
out plainly on the paper, and over this.
In Ink fresh and scarcely dry, had been
written "Peeler."
In the excepted instance the hand of
the slick worker had grown tired or
lost its cunning:, for the original "P"
In partly faded ink was left, In striking
contrast with the dewy black addition,
"eelers" written over the erasion. In
still another place the cross of the let
ter "t" had not been wholly erased. '
Slade admitted that he kept the
books himself; that he made the
erasures and substitutions, and then
had the hardihood to state to the court
that the money drawn on checks "to
cash." which was unindorsed. had been
paid to somebody, whom he did not
know, to pay how many men he did
not know, for peeling logs. This was
the extent of his testimony as to the
"eeler" and "Peeler" entries.
If secret service money had been
paid to any member or members of the
board, or an agent, it was important to
ascertain whether that fact was in any
manner told or implied in the Timber
Preserving books.
Items of the payment of money
amounting to thousands of dollars,
represented 'by checks drawn to cash
or Dundon himself the eventual desti
nation of which had been indicated
originally by private marks, either in
the check stub book or the journal,
showed recent alteration, in that the
marks had been erased.
Slade admitted that he made the
original entries and the subsequent
erasures, but denied positively that he
knew why the erasures had been made.
His only explanation was that he made
other erasures, and finally the cun
ningly devised plan of the defense was
suggested when the witness and his
rney dwelt with particular em
phasis on the fact that in two distinct
instances In which the Harbor Com
mission <md J. J. Keegan. their pri
vate secretary, were named in the
checks erasures of record had been
made. One was the payment to the
board of $~>s for rental: the other was
the $1006 check deposited with the sec
retary in the recent bidding contest.
This fake was so transparent that
everybody in the courtroom smiled.
Slade's attitude throughout the day
was one of open hostility tÂ© the inves
tigation and contempt of the court in
which he stood as a witness. He had
an attorney at his side to protect him,
next to whom in the jury box sat the
oleaginous Dundon himself. Darby
Laydor. appeared in the morning, and
was excused until afternoon.
Chairman Colnon was missed all day
from his favorite post behind Attorney
Stratton, who seemed to be in a state
of mind Inclining him to advocate the
suppression of newspapers.
Shortly after the morning session had
opened, with Slade on the witness
stand. Attorney Stratton made a
"special objection.'" which was in the
nature of a charge that counsel for the
Paraffine Company were "working"
the newspapers, to put it vulgarly. He
was sarcastically aggrieved that the
press never came to the rescue of "a
downtrodden public official." but were
always rescuing the downtrodden peo
ple.
""I will reply on behalf of Mr. Sulli
van and myseif." said Judge Cope,
"'that we have never at any stage of
this case sought newspaper publicity.
The case, as your Honor knows, pro
gressed here several days before the
newspapers mentioned it at all. We
have never sought to give information
to anybody connected with the news
papers. If the newspaper reporters de
sired information from us which we
thought we could conscientiously give
we have given it, as we believe that
the newspapers have the right to know
and be Informed upon questions In
volving public interests.
'"If this case has attracted the atten
tion of the newspapers it is not our
fault; It is the fault of those gentlemen
whose conduct has brought this inves
tigation. We are not responsible for
it, if this has become a public ques
tion.
"We have a right to come Into court
to try this question or any other legal
question upon which your Honor sees
fit to receive evidence. If the newspa
pers take it up, if the newspapers add
to the exposures that have been made
In court, the gentlemen should reflect
upon their past conduct and bemoan
that, and their sad fate, that has
brought upon them this notoriety.
'"We do not care about the notoriety,
although we appreciate the fact that
the service of the newspapers Is val
uable for public purposes.
"We expect it to have no Influence
upon the court or upon the trial. But
we say that we have a right to produce
this evidence, not because It may get
Into the newspapers or will get into
the newspapers, but because It is com
petent evidence for your Honor to re
ceive.
"The theory of this case is. as we
have explained several times, that the
Board of Harbor Commissioners have
unduly favored certain institutions
traveling or posing under the name of
corporations, or under names that
would indicate corporate existence, but
which turned out to be individuals and
partnerships; that they have unduly
favored them for a considerable length
of time.
"We now say that we desire to show
from the books of these institutions
that their conduct has been open to
suspicion. The entries in their books
are such that they are unable satisfac
torily to explain them, and the court
would have a right to infer from that
fact that the conduct of those corpora
tions or those individuals and partner
ships Is a matter for suspicion.
"Of course the Beard of State Harbor
Commissioners, the president of the
board or any member of the board,
may, if they can do it to the satisfac
tion of the court, come upon the stand
and purge themselves of any connec
tion with this matter.
"They may be able to convince your
Honor that their conduct has been per
fectly fair and open and free from sus
picion, but if they do cot do it. we
claim that this evidence of suspicious
transaction* in the books of these fay
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 4, 1898.
ored individuals and partnerships will
have a tendency to show that there has
been wrong conduct on the part of the
board."
â¢The court," said Judge Belcher, "'will
not amplify the rulings already made
touching matters of the same charac
ter or nature. It is only necessary to
say that if the defendants are not con
nected in some manner with this tes
timony it will not avail."
On going into the books of the tim
ber preserving annex of the Dundon
pool, that is to say, the journal and
ledger, a unique, complicated and mys
terious method was slowly revealed.
Slade said the books were kept in this
manner, with only two accounts, be
cause it made it so easy for him to
explain everything to Dundon's satis
faction. The following extract from
the testimony of the day will give a
fair idea, both as to the system of book
keeping, and Slade's comprehension of
its simplicity, together with the first
discovery of the "Peeler' in the log
pile:
Q.â On page 9 of your journal there is
an entry under the date of February 20.
IStt, "P. F. Dundon." Is that check 10?
A. â Tenth page, page on the ledger.
Qâ Referring to page 10 on the ledger?
A.â Yes. sir.
Q.â "Cash not accounted for. $650. Dit
to. $1060. Ditto, $350. Ditto. $5. Cash P.
F. Dundon as above. $:Â»65." The figure 2
precedes that last entry. What is that?
A.â The page on the ledger.
Q.~ What does that entry mean there,
"Cash not accounted for"? A.â lf you
will follow the entries right down
through it will explain itself.
Q. â Can you explain it? A.â Mr. Dun
don. in the course of our business, made
advances of money, and we credited it
to his account, and to keep it in double
entry form we had to make a cross en
try, and we opened on our ledger at that
time a cash account, and that I think is
the only time that cish Is mentioned in
our bookkeeping. He afterward rendered
us an itemized statement and turned in
his vouchers for the amount, stating for
what the money had been used. We just
credited him in blank with the money,
S2OCS. ar.d charged it to cash. Afterward
we made the cross entry, itemizing the
whole thing. It was for moneys advanced
and he afterward accounted for it.
The courtâ To whom? A.â To the San
Francisco Timber Preserving Company.
Mr. Copeâ Do you know what for? A.â
Yes, sir; that Is, the after entries will
show.
Q.â What after entries? A.â Following.
It seems to me rather intricate, and as
it happened in !*s*>, which is nearly two
years ago, I think, to refresh my mem
ory on that, that I had to refer to his
statements which we could produce at
the request'of the attorney. I don't real
ly remember what that is.
Q. â Your system of bookkeeping is not
so simple of explanation when it comes
to examination. A.â lt seems to be a very
difficult matter to make a proper expla-
nation of.
Q.â ls there anything in these books at
all that would show the nature and char
acter of these expenditures of Mr. Dun
don; what they were spent for? A. â I
think that I could find it in the books;
perhaps not itemized. I know about what
that money was advanced for. I could
explain at quite a good deal of length
about that, what that money was spent
for, and I can bring his statement with
the vouchers for the money, showing
what he had spent it for.
Q.â We would like to have all these
vouchers; as many as you have of Mr.
Dundon's. I will cail your attention to
page 27 of the journal, under the head of
expense account. The date is November
23. 159Â»5; check No. 211, S2OO. Will you
produce that? A.â Here It is (producing).
Q.â This is a check to cash. Have you
the stub book of that? A.â No. I had it
here, but I didn't bring anything except
what you told me to bring.
Mr. Sullivanâ We would like to have the
stub book. A. â I can't get it here before
the noon recess.
Mr. Cope â That item is now "peelers."
That appears to have been erased and the
word "peelers" written in. Do you know
when that was done? A.â No. Ido not.
Qâ Did you do it? A.â l did.
Q.â Do you know when yon did it? A.â
I do not.
Q.â What was your object in doing it?
A.â l don't know. It was evidently wrft
ten in wrong and corrected. I might make
an explanation to your Honor about items
charged to expense this way: There is
no charge to anything except to expense,
and it amounts to a great many thousand
dollars. All the labor is charged to ex
pense and all of the improvements that
have been made from time to time, in
cluding the time after the fire; that is
all charged to expense, and we have no
other account to charge anything to ex
cept to expense and to oil. All the creo
sote oil that has been purchased has been
charged to oil account. Everything else
has been charged to expense account.
There are only the two accounts.
Q. â Tou will observe that check No. til
is made to cash. $200? A.â Yes. sir.
Q.â lt bears no indorsement whatso
ever? A. â It is not necessary.
Q.â l am not askinej-ou whether it is
necessary or not. A. â iPbears no indorse
ment.
Qâ Tou showed us a check made to
cash and indorsed by Dundon. A.â lt was
done unnecessarily.
Q-â Do you know who handled or cashed
that check? A.â l do not.
Q.â You say you don't know when this
change was made, the erasure and the
word "peelers" written In? A.â l don't
know.
Qâ Do you know why It was done? A â
Except that it was entered erroneously
in the first place and corrected.
Q.â Don't you know that change is a
recent change? A.â No.
Q.â You are familiar with ink? A.â l
am familiar with It.
Mr. Sullivanâ lsn't that Ink fresh?
A. â It may be fresh.
Qâ It was not made within a day or
two? A.â Ho.
Q.â Or within the last week? A.âWith
in the last week. no.
Qâ Will you produce check No. 139?
(.Witness does so.)
Qâ There is nothing to show from the
check what that money was for? A.â No
Qâ Do you know what it was for? A.â
Xo.
W-â Produce that voucher also: I sup

When the vouchers arrived it trans
pired that the Dundon cash checks of
$2CNÂ»S and f S7S SI were for the Dundon
Iron JVorks.
After that a lengthy series of "peel
er" checks and checks to Dundon and
cash, without voucher proof, in con
nection with -which erasures had been
made in the accounts, were put in evi
dence. Attorneys Cope and Sullivan
had a magnifying glass, with the aid
of which they minutely examined the
"peeler" substitutions and erasures.
Judge Belcher availed himself of the
instrument frequently. Slade declined
to do so when requested to look at the
fresh made fuzz on his fine work on
the ground that he was not an expert.
At or.c time Slade affirmed he could
produce vouchers for every check, but
when it came to the mysterious checks
for $200 and $230 to cash he discovered
that the vouchers for them did not ex
ist.
Darby Laydon reappeared after re
cess and requested permission to ab
sent himself, explaining to the court
that he was a bidder, with a single
competitor, for a contract, and as they
were "within a few hundred dollars of
each other a gr;od deal of work had to
be done." The unconscious witticism
provoked an outburst of laughter. Lay
don was allowed to stay away from
court until next Wednesday.
On one of the "peeler" stubs the
word had been written above the era
sure. Slade did not know why the era
sure should have been made and
"peeler" written above in order to
make a correction. He had a good
memory, but it was not good enough
to remember why he did this or for
"whom or what or where."
It would be a work of tiring reitera
tion to review Slade's testimony as to
these checks and erased entries. Where
Dundon received checks "to cash"
without vouchers Plade said they were
for salary. Though a partner, part of
the time Dundon received a salary, he
added.
Coming down to December, 1897, j
Slade's memory as to the cause of
these many unexplained expenditures
did not improve in the slightest de
gree. The court significantly asked
him at this point. "You did the writing
in the books all during this period?"
"Yes, sir," was the emphatic reply.
"And the date of that last item?"
asked the court of counsel.
"December 27, 1897," was the an
swer.
The sum of these many checks was
thousand?! of dollars.
Just before adjournment Judge Cope
discovered on pase 76 of the ledger an
entry of $30,959 64.
"Mr. Stratton." exclaimed Slade, !
excitedly, "this is a private matter."
Stratton was poised over the ledger, '
but straightened up and flushed to the
roots of the hair. "You have your own
counsel here to represent you in pri
vate matters," said he. rebuklngly. and
walked back to his seat at the table.
It will be remembered that Slade
early In the day had testified he kept
only two accounts, in his simple way.
The $20,959 64 turned out to be the
accumulation, for the months between
March. 1897, and January, 1898, of a
creosote plant account, a stock, account,
an oil account, a Gus Partridge ac
count, a State Board of Harbor Com
missioners' account, a Dundon account,
an S. E. Slade account, a dividend ac
count, a creopotins: account, a Wells,
Fargo account and an expense ac
count.
Further hearing of the case was post
poned by the court until Tuesday.

Guatemalans Waiting
for a Good Chance
at Barrios.
Rifles and Cannon Suffi
cient to Equip a Strong
Army.
Story of an American Carpen
ter Who Recently Made
His Escape.
SIX WEEKS IN A DUNGEON.
John F. Con-way Says the Revolution
Down There Has Only Just
Begun.
The most thrilling story of the hor
rors of a Central American revolution
that has yet reached this city comes
from John F. Conway, an American
carpenter, who recently succeeded in
escaping from Guatemala and made his
way to home and friends in spite of the
effons of desperate Guatemalans to
take his life before he succeeded in
communicating his knowledge to the
world.
Conway's life was in constant danger
for months up to the time the steamer
on which he sailed was in blue water
and beyond reach of the Guatemalans,
and though he lost his all at the hands
of the savage natives he vows never to
return, but to take his chances here
after beneath the protection of the
Stars and Stripes.
He tells of American Consuls who
admitted their inability to save those
they are paid to protect from degrada
tion and death, and of American citi
zens disowning their country and
; claiming to be English in order to save
S themselves from further imprisonment
or ignominious death from a rifle bul
let.
The most important part of his story.
! however, does not relate to what has
! passed, but more to what may be ex
pected in the near future. According to
his story the rebellion started by Gen
1 eral Manuel Fuentes-Barrios, brother
; in-law of the present dictator of Gua
temala, is In its incipiency and must
inevitably end in the defeat of the self
constituted president. He tells of thou
sands of stands of small arms, thou
sands of eager revolutionists, rapid
fire and Gatling guns and competent
leaders collected across the Mexican
' border and only awaiting an oppor
tunity to swoop across the boundary
and drive Barrios from the soil he has
usurped.
"No one has any idea of the horrors
of a Central American revolution un
less they go through the actual expe
rience as I did during the last three
months," said Conway.
"I left San Francisco, which is my
home, two years ago on the promise of
receiving large wages at my trade in
the cities and plantations of Guatemala.
I wound up in a Guatemalan jail as a
political suspect, and in the end be
came a revolutionist, more to get re
venge on those who had wronged me
than for any other reason. Guatemala
has been and is now a hotbed of revo
lution, which no one except those that
have been there can understand.
"The revolution which is now
smoldering started in San Marcos, the
home of Manuel Fuentes-Barrios, the
brother-in-law of the President, and
that accomplished scoundrel at once
assumed the leadership of the revolu
tionary forces which consisted of a few
thousand assorted peons and coffee
pickers, most of them well armed, but
the large majority ignorant of the
workings and uses of the modern rifle.
"From San Marcos to Quezaltenango
is only a short distance, and when his
standard was raised Fuentes-Barrios
at once made for that place, knowing
that the cathedral there was rich and
that large tribute could be levied if the
place could be captured. At that time
Juan Aparicio and sixteen other
wealthy Spaniards, who were suspect
ed of having aided the revolution with
money and men, were in jail at Que
zaltenango, and word was sent to
Fuentes-Barrios that if he fired a sin
gle shot on the town there would be a
bullet put through Aparicio's heart.
"He fired on the town from the sur
rounding heights, and Aparicio, who
was a brother of the wealthy Aparicio*
of New York, was taken out in front of
the cathedral with his sixteen com
panions and shot to death.
"The man who slew him, an officer
of the Government troops, met with
speedy retribution, for as soon as the
news of Aparicio's death reached his
vast estates his superintendent, Fer
mlne Piales. armed himself, and. hunt
ing down the assassin of his employer,
shot him dead after explaining his
reason for committing the act. Piales
followed Fuentes-Barrios into Mexico
with the intention of killing him also,
but the wily ex-rebel had made good
his escape to San Francisco before his
Implacable foe could reach him.
"Once in possession oc Quezaltenango
Fuentes-Barrios began preparations
for taking everything in sight. The
venerable Bishop who had charge of
the cathedral was told he must pro
duce $50,000 within twelve hours, and
when he stated that such a thing was
impossible he was taken out to the
place where Aparicio was executed,
and a file of soldiers with loaded and
cocked rifles lined up In front of him.
In this position he was given the high
wayman's old alternative, 'money or
your life.'
"Forty thousand dollars was th*Â»
amount he succeeded in getting and he
was given an additional two hours to
get the remainder. He must have suc
ceeded, for he was not shot.
"There was a reign of terror In
Quezaltenango while Fuentes-Barrios
and his men were there. As the revo
hztionists marched into town after
driving out the handful of Government
troops they Â«aw a gang of American
carpenters working on the Govern
ment hospital building. In pure want
onness the rebels began firing on them,
and before they could escape Jack Aul
and Patrick O'Shaughnessy. the two
San Francisco carpenters, were killed,
"There was nothing to stop Fuentes-
Barrios had he chosen to advance, but
he was not In a mood to go ahead until
he had cared for his treasure. He sent
13S mules loaded with silver across
the Mexican border, and when the Gov
ernment army arrived retired and left
the country, looting Las Mercedes of
$5000 as he went.
"When I reached Quezaltenango on
my way to the outer world I found
Jack Cummings. a San Francisco
plumber; Dr. Bran, an Englishman:
William Nelson and Charles Connolly,
two New York carpenters, and a couple
of Germans, .whose names I do no re- "
member, all â¢ bent on >. the same errand
I went to Samuel Lord, the local Con- 'â 
sul, and asked for .a passport, but he
refused to give :me ; one, claiming that
he did not know that I was an/Amer- \
lean citizen. The first thing we knew
we were in the little stuffy jail with '
every prospect of remaining there for
an indefinite period if we were fortu
nate enough to escape being shot. The
fact that Dr. Bragg was an English
man saved us. The Guatemalans were
notified by the representative of the
English Government that unless we .
were liberated within two hours he
would bring English guns in plenty
to bear on anything in Guatemala they :
could reach, and the doors of the jail
speedily swung open.
'â¢So notorious has it become In Gua
temala that an American gets no pro
tection from his Government that it is
almost invariably the case that Amer
icans repudiate their own country in
times of trouble and claim protection
of England through her representa
tives. When I went to Guatemala I .
asked Consul-General Pringle for my
papers showing that I was an Ameri
can. He wanted 55 to make them out,
and I told him that he was paid by the
Government to do that work and that

the revolutionists were offering Ameri

"His action had the desired effect and
my life was saved. I do not care to
give the name of the ship nor her mas

captain is running still to Guatemalan
ports and it might cause him trouble.

HOT TIMES IN THE VALLEY
Commissioner Kinney Says a Tin-
Horn Gambler, Employed as Guide,
Menaced Him With a Revolver.
Governor Budd, Abbott Kinney, W.
TV. Foote, Charles G. Clinch, Charles
6. Givens and H. J. Ostrander attended
a session of the Tosemite Valley Com
mission yesterday forenoon. A short
time before the board was called to or
der General John F. Sheehan, ex-sec
retary of the commission, had a talk
with the members of the finance com
mittee and assured them that he stood
ready to accompany them to the Co
lumbian Bank, where he would turn
over all the money deposited to the
credit of the commission and also turn
over the bank book. The committtee
arranged to receive the money and
book at the adjournment of the board.
Among the letters placed before the
board was one from the Columbian
Banking Company addressed to Gen
eral Sheehan, in which It was stated
that the balance to the credit of the
Yosemite Commission in the bank at
11:15 a. m., February 3, was $1535 97.
After the session was regularly open
ed Secretary Lermen reported that he
had followed out the instructions of the
board given at the last meeting and
presented to the bank the demand
signed by the president of the commis
sion that the banking institution turn
over to the board all the books and
papers belonging to the commission.
The bank promised to comply with the
order, but was subsequently served
with a notice by Sheehan's attorney
that the account with the bank was
General Sheehan's private account. In
view of this notice the bank declined
to obey the order of the board.
The Governor suggested that an or-
FEATURES AT THE MINING FAIR.
der be obtained from the Attorney-Gen
eral directing the bank to produce the
books.
Commissioner Givens remarked:
"Mr. Sheehan was here a few minutes
since and agreed to surrender the bank
book and turn over the balance of
money."
Commissioner Foote said: "It must
â¢^ be clear enough now for all to under
stand that General Sheehan paid these
bills some time after they were marked
on the books as paid. I have no desire
to persecute him, but I hold that the
bank book should be placed in the pos
session of the board."
The finance committee, which con
sists of Commissioners Givens, Kinney
and Clinch, was instructed to obtain
the book and the cash balance.
The committee will now proceed with
the aid of an expert to examine all the
accounts. The Controller's statement
was received and read to the board..
Commissioner Kinney, from a com
mittee appointed to promote travel to
the Yosemite Valley, reported confer
ences with the transportation compa
nies and gave assurance that the re
duced rates allowed to Native Sons
would be extended to other grades of
humanity. At the suggestion of the
fommisploner the board adopted a res
olution inviting the American Forest
ers' Association to hold their next an
nual meeting in the valley.
The Coffman & Kenney lease was ]
called up by Commissioner Kinney. |
Hints had been thrown out at various :
times that the lessees had disregarded
th*Â» rules for the government of the j
rtprrvatinn and had been carrying
things with a high hand, regardless of
the guardian.
At the annual meeting in the valley j
last June the Commissioners agreed to j
jtMvo Coffman & Kenney certain privi- |
lVtffs for four years and in return the !
concessionaires agreed to furnish hay
;.t cost. The price of hay to campers
was therefore reduced from $50 to $30
a ton.
< 'â¢ iff man & Kenney represented in a
communication to the board that they
â¢ .til gofle to considerable expense on
the strength of a four years' lease, and
did not view with satisfaction the sug
gestion to limit the lease to a shorter

NEW FENDER FOR ELECTRIC CARS.
In pursuance of a decision recently ar
rived at by the board of directors of the
Market Street Cable Company, General
Manager Vining yesterday issued an or
der to provide all the electric cars be
longing to the company with a new fen
der.
The fender is one which originated
with the company and consists of a sort
of a steel scoop attached to the car truck
and curving down to within a few inches
of the rails directly in front of the
wheels.
This scoop Is connected to a long steel
rod, which stretches to the forward
guard and is held in place by a trigger
like arrangement. This trigger is slipped
either by an obstruction striking the for
ward guard or by means of a foot-trip,
worked by the motorman from the floor
fight seemed to be present. Mr. Ken
ney of the firm was on hand to protect
his own interests, and Abbott Kinney of
the commission seemed to be ready to
engage in a dispute on the merits of
the controversy.
Governor Budd examined the records
of the annual meeting in June last and
found that the offer tendered by Coff
man & Kenney had been accepted-
Mr. Kinney insisted that the board
had no authority under the by-laws to
execute a lease for a longer period than
one year. He spoke of the inefficiency
of Co-ffman & Kenney's guides and
how they deliberately refused to show
tourists certain points of interest in the
valley which the coupons entitled the
â¢ travelers to see. Concerning the moral
character of the guides, the complain
ing Commissioner remarked: "I as
certained in the valley that one of the
guides was a tin-horn gambler. He
threatened me with a revolver at the
I hotel."
Addressing Mr. Kenney, the Commis
sioner. Abbott Kinney, said: "In de
fiance of rules your stock has been run
ning at large for years. No attention
was paid to protests until the Sheriff
of Mariposa County threatened to ar
rest you. Until last year travel to the
Yosemite Valley had been annually de
clining. The questir.-n to be settled
now, is whether the Commissioners or
concessionaires shall run the valley."
Governor Budd reviewed the former
management of the valley and spoke of
the pools and exclusive privileges
which had been abolished during his
own administration. He called atten
tion to the diversion of $13,000 by the
Board of Commissioners which imme
diately preceded" his administration,
and said:
"The management had been so bad
and reckless that the Legislature at
the beginning of my administration cut
down the appropriation to one-half the
usual allowance. I instituted meas
ures of reform in the management of
the trust. 1 broke up the pools. Hay
was ?60 a ton. We brought it down to
I $30. Wo had but one line of transpor
tation to the valley. Now we have
three. I opened the competing line

Before the meeting adjourned an
agreement was reached between Kin

that his lease should be cut in two

Commissioner Foote had the record

of the car, and allows the scoop to fall
down directly on the rails, offering an
absolute protection from the wheels to
any one who may be under the car.
Mr. Vlning, when seen yesterday, said:
"We have had numerous patterns be
fore the Board of Supervisors for the last
two years, but as they have acted on
none of them we decided to adopt this
device without waiting for an ordi
nance.
"We are more than willing to take
every precaution we can to insure the
safety of persons living along the line of
our roads, but in my opinion fenders do
but little good. Practically no one is
ever injured by the wheels of the cars,
but when an accident occurs the injuries

Mephisto Mystifies the
Crowds at the Mining
Fair.
Many Other Startling and
Novel Features Offered
Visitors.
Souvenir Spoons to Be Presented
to the Ladies Who Attend
To- Day.
The crowd at the Mining Fair is
steadily increasing. The attendance
last night was exceedingly large. Some
excellent features were presented by
the management, and several were re
peated from the afternoon's pro
gramme.
Mephisto, the King of Fire, gave an
exhibition of devouring flames, there
was also a popcorn eating contest be
tween four small boys, and the candy
batch swinging contest proved one of
the best features that has yet been pre
sented. It was between Edward To>
wer, Martin Zeis, "W. G. Sparrow and
Louis Gordon of Gruenhagen's candy
factory. It was easily won by Edward
Tower, who pulled his thirty-five
pounds of candy in the shortest time.
The afternoon programme, although
somewhat altered, proved very inter
esting. The Klondike dog bench show
was postponed until next week, when
it will be held under the auspices of
the St. Bernard Club of this city. The
management replaced this attraction
with Professor Batholomew's trained
contortion horse, "Lady Phyllis." This
beautiful animal, although it was her
first appearance in public without the
other horses that act with her, gave a
wonderful exhibition and evoked much
applause from the audience.
U. H. Henry's performing bears were
the next attraction, and they excited
much amusement by their tricks and
grotesque actions.
J. L. Waller's King Frisco, a St. Ber
nard, Rose X, a pointer, and Queen the
Second, an Irish setter, were on exhi
bition and much admired. They wi'l
be in the bench show next week.
One of the most unique attractions of
the fair is the old and original pioneer
printing press, now owned by J. A. Fil
cher. Its history is linked with the
early journalism of California in a most
historical and interesting manner.
It was first brought from the East
to Monterey in 1847 by the famous
Sam Brannan, who started the Cali
fornian, the first paper published in
the State. Later the press was moved
to this city and the Californlan was
consolidated with the Alta, the paper
being known as the Alta-Californian.
The press was next moved to Marys
vine, where a paper was started, but
this venture proved a failure. In 1852
it was moved to Auburn, Placer
County, and the Placer Herald start
ed. Thhis paper Is still running. Here
In 1872 the press was bought by Mr.
Filcher when he purchased the paper,
and this interesting relic has been in
his possession ever since. The make
of the press is not known, but it is
supposed to be the Franklin pattern.
Among the presents that will make
the Klondike wedding on next Tues
day a special feature Is the mammoth
pavement. It Is a curious fact that as
long as I have been connected with the
company 1 ni-ver remember an instance
where life was lost on a regular crossing.
AYe do the best we can to keep a sharp
lookout, but if people will allow their
children to run unattended in front of
our cars tUc greatest vigilance cannot
prevent an occasional accident.
"The cost of our cars is about $3000
each, and as the fenders only cost in tlie
neighborhood of $30 each the expense
practically amounts' to nothing, and that,
or an expense much greater, will cheer
fully be endured if we think any positive
good will result. However, fenders will
now be on the cars as quickly as our me
chanics can put them there, and it will
not be our fault if they do not prove as
efficacious as they are expected to be in
preventing accidents."
cake that will be presented to the
bride. It Is on exhibition at the Del
Monte Milling Company's booth. The
cake weighs 300 pounds and will be
taken by the couple upon their honey
moon to the Klondike. They intend
to eat it upon the trip in place of car
rying provisions, and they hope to
have enough left over when they get
to Dawson City to give every miner
there a slice.
The singing of the miners' quartet
always proves an interesting feature.
Souvenir spoons will be presented to
all the ladies who visit the fair to
day. Among the features to-day will
be the Ladies' Symphony Quartet in
the art gallery in the afternoon and
the vaudeville show at night of the
leading female artists from the vari
ous theaters in the city. The tickets
for Saturday for the school teachers
will be honored at the door at any
time during the day or night that
they are presented.
Hon. James B. Coffey, Judge J. L.
Joachimsen and C. L. Barrington
have been selected by the management
of the fair to judge the baby show on
Tuesday.

the council, delivered an address on the
"Perpetuity of the Republic," In which he
took the ground that If this republic is to
be preserved It must be done through
the loyalty of the patriotic organizations
of America to the church. He added:
"There is nothing on Sunday evenings
except the theaters, paid places of amuse
ment. Let us forego this pleasure for six
months and Instead visit some church, be
It Protestant, Jewish or Catholic. Let us
Bee what the effect of such a movement
will have on the community."

STILL THE BOULEVARD.
The Spring Valley Water Company-
Claims to Have Kept Its
Agreement.
The entire attention of the Street Com
mittee of the Board of Supervisors was
taken up yesterday with hearing argu
ments regarding the completion of the
Balboa Boulevard.
Mayor Phelan claimed that the Spring
Valley Company did not seem inclined to
keep its agreement regarding finishing
the boulevard through its lands. Engin
eer SohuÃsler of the company denied that
the company had been dilatory in its
work and threw back the .statement of
Adolph Sutro's representatives that his
company was trying to got out of its
promises. He asked whether the city
would build the boulevard through the
company's lands free of cost to the cor
poration if a right of way was granted
The committee was not ready to say and
put the matter over for a week.
Charged With Grand Larceny.
George. Merlon, a cigarmakor, 27 years
of age, was arrested by Officer F. Nolan
on Kcarny street last night, charged with
grand larceny and taken to the Califor
nia-street Station. Merlon is alleged to
have stolen jewelry valued at $120 from
his sister, Mrs. McGregor, who lives on
Clement street between Ninth and Tenth
avenues. The complaint was made by
Mrs. McGregor's husband.

INVOKE THE AID
OF ST. BLAISE
Ceremony of Blessing the
Throat at St. Ignatius
Church.
Hundreds of People Kneel to
Receive the Coveted
Rite.
A Similar Service Observed at St.
Joseph's Church on Tenth
Street.
Hundreds of Catholics from all parts
of the city crowded St. Ignatius and
St. Joseph churches yesterday to in
voke the blessing of St. Blaise as a
protection against the ailments and dis
eases of the throat.
From an early hour in the morning,
and, in fact, immediately after the cele
bration of 8 o'clock mass throngs of
people began to crowd the churches and
block the aisles leading to the altar
rail. Old men leaning on their canes
and supporting their tottering bodies
to the sanctuary by means of this sup
port, infants carried in the arms of
their mothers, children with school
books under their armsâ all alike wait
ed their turn to kneel before the altar
to receive the coveted blessing.
It was an impressive spectacle to see
Father Varsi and the other priests of
the Society of Jesus who assisted in
the ceremony at St. Ignatius Church
passing in front of the altar rail, placing
the two blessed candles one on each side
of the throat of each suppliant and
pronouncing the words of blessing
which would be a protection and a pre
ventive against disease.
In Catholic countries it has ever been
the custom, on the Feast of St. Blaise,
for the faithful; together with their
children, to present themselves at the
altar rail in order to have the throat
blessed. The candles which are used
on the occasion, are blessed on the
feast of the saint.
During the ceremony the priest says
the following words: "Through the in
tercession of St. Blaise, may the Lord
deliver thee from every ailment of the
throat. Amen." This is the formula
prescribed by the Sacred Congregation
of Rites in the decree of March 20,
1869.
The following is the story of the
marvelous cure St. Blaise worked upon
the widow's son, who was slowly dy
ing of strangulation from a bone lodged
in his throat, and this cure forms the
basis of the present ceremony of in
voking his blessing on the anniversary
of the incident:
"St. Blaise was born at Sebaste, in
Armenia. In early life he applied him- I
self to the study of medicine, but, lis
tening to the call of God, he gave up
his profession and studied foT the
priesthood. The Bishop Waving died
St. Blaise was appointed to succeed
him. In the meanwhile Agricolaus. the i
Governor of Armenia, by order of the
Emperor, Licinius, - began persecution
against the Christians. At the earn
est entreaty of his flock, the Bishop
retired to the vicinity of Mount Ar
geus, where for some time he hid him
self in a cave. One day, while the sol
diers of Agricolaus were following the
chase, they discovered his hiding place
and arrested him. The news spread
quickly among his flock, and the people
went out of the city to meet him.
Among these was a poor widow, whose
only son was dying from the effects of
a bone which had lodged in his throat.
Prostrating herself on the ground, she
implored him to save her son's life.
Moved to pity by the mother's grief
the saint placed his hands upon the
child's head, praying to God as he j
pronounced the words of blessing over
his throat. The boy was instantly
cured.
"On account of this miracle, as well
as many other singular favors of the
same kind which have been obtained
through his intercession, St. Blaise has
come to be the patron of those who suf
fer from ailments of the throat."
Fully 15,000 people knelt to receive the
blessing of the throat at St. Ignatius
Church alone, to say nothing of the
vast numbers who attended the cere
mony at St. Joseph's Church.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NF.W YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Feb. 3. -The strength of to
day's stock market was confined to spots and
the general tendency continued toward a lower
plane in realizing sales. Pressure by the bear
traders was marked and the outside support
offered by the buying orders through commis
sion house? was considerably less. There was
a strong tone In a few individual stocks and
advances in others were brought about by
manipulation. London also bought some se
curities here. All causes combined, however
aid nm avail tn maintain prices in the general
iOM and the average level of the market sagged
to a lower basl*. The most conspicuous move
ment of the day was in Great Northern pre
ferred, which added 5 points to its recent ui>
ward course, making itÂ» gain thus far for th*
Week 2fi points. The supply of this stock in
the street at any time is exceedingly li K ht and
urgi-nt demand for even a small volume raises
the price very quickly. The methods of opera
tlon on this road and its financial relations to
Its subsidiary companies make the stock at
tractive at any time on the general possibillty
of the readjustment of relations, and the ad
vance this week gives strong reasons for sup
posing the general possibilities are shaping in
concrete form. There was nothing in the news
of the day to warrant a statement as to what
that concrete form may be. Over 3000 shares
changed hands during the day. Coalers were
favorably affected as a group by the prevail
ing cold weather, but they failed to hold their
gain. Sugar also ruled above yesterday's clos
ing prices. Other exceptions to the prevailing
weakness might be named, but they were not
conspicuous, and none held all their advance
Union Pacific preferred was very largely dealt
In and rose sharply over last night's close
but fell below before the close. The activity
of the markets showed a considerable falling
off from recently prevailing averages.
The activity in the bond market was much
bftter sustained than In stocks, and prices
were better held, the general level being higher
and some sharp gains being scored. Total
sales. J. 1.610,000.

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. Feb. 3.â The Evening Post's â¢
London financial cablegram says: The stock >
markets here were irregular and dull to-day, !
the reaction being most marked In all stocks '
recently affected by Klondike influences. There :
was a sharp falling In Grand Trunk, good
traffic returns being offset by a report of a |
pending rupture with the Canadian Pacific.
Forelcn stocks were good on Paris buying, and
mines were better for the same reason. The
general tendency here at the moment Is to se- ;
cure profits on Americans, but there is a firm i
undertone.

' "ft ednesday curb, though there was no such ;
! rebound as was looked for. May advanced to j
' 84% c, where It held for a short time, then \
commenced to sag again. About noon the
: market again developed strength. Short sell
â  ing had become too popular and the market
I had become somewhat oversold in conse
4 quence. Brokers for the Lelter crowd appear
ed in the pit, and their buying started an ad
vance that carried the price within a few
minutes to 9b%c. The corn market became
very strong about that time and lent its lnftu- '
i ence, as did the Atlantic port clearances, j
which amounted to the liberal total of 522,000 '
buKhftls. Uurlng this rally the only real ac
tivity of the session was exhibited, the over
sold condition of the market making a rush of
shorts an easy matter. After the Lelter buy
ing was over, however, the market fell away
again. The advance Induced the putting forth i
ol more and heavier quantities on short ac
count, and this caused the final collapse â¢ in
prices. This time May declined to 94">ic. The
market was given support again Just before j
the close, buying again being apparently led |
by the Letter Interests, and the price had re
covered to 94% c before the session ended.
'â  Corn in the main was firm and fairly active.
May closed Vi<gÂ»&c higher at 29c. Oats were I
active and firm. May closed Vie higher. A
good deal of interest was again shown in pro
visions. At the close May pork was 7%c high
er. May lard 2VÂ»c higher and May ribs oc
higher.

IMPROVEMENT IN RAISINS.
NEW YORK. Feb. 3.â The Journal of Com
merce says: After a long period of depression
â  the market for California loose Raisins Is be
i ginning to show signs of improvement. Liberal
' consignments to â  Eastern markets by . Coast*
i packers have shut off the outlet. for New York
receivers to a considerable extent, and com
petition between sellers here and at out of
town points has resulted, It is reported, in a
demoralized condition, out of which has come
I no benefit to any one concerned. | The wants of
consumption In the East, it is reported, have
gradually absorbed the supplies or good fruit.
! but have left comparatively a large supply of
| Raisins, damaged or otherwise inferior fruit,
! efforts to sell which have had a depressing in
[ fluence upon market values heretofore. As the
' bulk of good Raisins have gone Into consump
i tion and the demand for that class of goods
j Is reported to be Increasing, a firmer feeling
! has been developed, though no actual increase
j In prices is to be reported.

ROOT MAY BE
IN DANCER
Mrs. Gordon's Confession
May Lead to His
Arrest.
His Bondsmen Now Have
Hope That They May
Be Safe.
A Woman Scorned Cannot Be Ignored
Even by Gold-Brick
Men.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, Feb 3.
The confession of Mrs. Gordon, wife
of Charles Gordon, the gold brick man
now in San Quentin. will probably lead
to the arrest of "Big Foot Dave,"
otherwise Root, who forfeited his bail
of $7500 in the Superior Court of this
county rather than stand trial.
At the time that the gold brick men,
Including Raymond, Gordon and Root,
were arrested in this city Root was
enabled to get out on bail, and after
the conviction of Gordon Root thought
It best to disappear. The case was
noticeable fcr the many attempts made
to secure the release of Gordon on
habeas corpus proceedings, but the
prosecution was ready with additional
charges in case habeas corpus should
be successful, that this method of try
ing to obtain release was given up.
Patsy Carroll, well known In San
Francisco, seemed to have full charge
of the gold brick men's business while
In jail, and was successful in finding
bonds for Root. A few days ago the
bonds were declared forfeited, and one
of the bondsmen, Mrs. L. Ross, has
been forced into insolvency because of
the judgment against her.
Now that Gordon has been aban
doned to his fate in San Quentin and
his wife in New York has also been
cast aside by those who were with her
husband in the gold brick business, it
is very likely that Root may be traced.
A few days ago word was received by
the Oakland Â»police authorities that
Root could be captured in New York,
and now that Mrs. Gordon has reveal
ed the names and whereabouts of all
the gang, the swindlers of Banker Lit
tle of Dixon, who has since died, and
Farmer Hofstra from Contra Costa,
may yet be brought to Oakland for
trial, and the revenge sought by Mrs.
Gordon may be gratified.

THE LATEST AMBITION OF OAKLAND.
OAKLAND Feb. 3.-Now that the movement to consolidate Oakland,
Berk^y and Alameda and some eastern territory has been activriy taken
up the subject is being very generally discussed There is so me doubt as
to whether the consolidation Of all the proposed territory can be effected
by an act of the Legislature or whether it will be nece. sary to "Ã¼bmit It
to a vote of all the towns and cities involved. President Taylor of the
Board of Trade and President Arper of the Merchants E xch ange, together
with a large majority of their organizations, are heartily in favor of the
formation of a city and county, and the conference next week will be

IS CURIOUS
An Old-Time Litigant Too
Sick to Suit the
Court.
Her Doctor Must Explain How
She Has So Many
Ailments.
New Chapter In a Romance Which
Began With the Civil
War.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Feb. S.
Mrs. Kate Grogan Dulcich has been
in the courts more than any other
woman in Alameda County, but she
was not able to be present to-day and
her doctor has been summoned Into
court to explain.
Mrs. Dulcich has also been married
more than any other one woman in
this county and her complications in
the matrimonial line have involved
her in litigation that appears to be
endless.
This morning she should have been
In court, but Instead a certificate
from Dr. A. F. (.'hilds was handed the
court, stating that she was suffering
from "pneumonia and indigestion."
Judge Ogden offered to go to the
house to take her deposition, but the
attorney stated that she was too ill.
The court then ordered the doctor to
appear and explain the meaning of
the duplicated term, "indigestion and
pneumonia."
The Dulcich romance began with the
marriage of the woman to Terrence
Grogan, who was killed at Gettysburg,
and has now reached a dispute over
a little piece of property in East Oak
land.
In the interval, Mrs. Dulcich says,
Grogan has died, and In 1871 she mar
ried Louis Dobin. She went with him
to Peru, was an actress and they both
ran a saloon. After some years Mr.
and Mrs. Dobin parted, and later she
discovered that she had married not
Dobin but Louis Dulcich. They had ac
quired property located in East Oak
land, and it is now in dispute.
Dulcich noxV claims to have discov
ered that Grogan was never dead and
now lives in Washington, and so he
claims that Mrs. Grogan-Dobin-Dulcich
has no right to anything.
JURY LOCKED UP.
No Verdict Last Night in the
Knowles Case.
OAKLAND, Feb. 3.â At midnight the
jury in the Knowles case, which was
charged at 5 o'clock, were called into
court, and as they could not agree
they were locked up for the night.

evidence were at variance, and stated
that the University of California was
the injured party. Both sides sub
mitted arguments on the motion.
It is understood that the jury stood
8 to 4 for conviction.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 4, 1898.
COONEY IS A
GOOD OFFICER
Chief Lloyd's Attempt to
Break Him Has
Collapsed.
The Lengthy Alleged Charges
Are Unanimously
Dismissed.
Inquiry Brought Out the Fact That
He Is Intelligent and
Brave.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Feb. 3.
The Board of Police Commissioners
by a unanimous vote this morning de
cided that there was no foundation for
the charges preferred by Chief of Po
lice Lloyd against Officer C. B. Cooney.
The trial of this officer has occupied
several days, and his special counsel
has contested all the points brought
OFFICER COONEY, WHO IS SUSTAINED
BY THE COMMISSIONERS.
forward by Chief Lloyd. Prosecuting
Attorney Melvin gave evidence that
was greatly in favor of Cooney. and
paid a high compliment to the officer's
intelligence, and this opinion had great
weight with the Commissioners.
Chief Lloyd's charges consisted of a
long list of generalities, Including try-
Ing to create "dissension between two
brother officers" and similar vague
offenses.
Two or three witnesses from West
Oakland testified that Cooney had not
done his duty, and others testified that
he was a good officer. Chief Lloyd es
sayed the role of public prosecutor,
but did not make his charges stick.
| Captain Fletcher testified that while
'he did not consider Cooney the best
! officer on the force, there were many
! others who were not more competent.
i He said Cooney was on a wrong beat;
that there were certain men good on
; some beats and second rate on others,
! and that Cooney should be put on a
; beat where he would be far more use
ful than in West Oakland.
Officer Cooney told his own story on
the witness stand. His beat covers a
vast territory, and the special charge
that a section of fence had been torn
down and he had- not been present at
the time appeared to the Commission
ers to have very little merit. He was
examined by his counsel, M. C. Chap
man, who took occasion to bring out
several incidents showing that Cooney
had been on several occasions credited
with acts of bravery in making arrests.
One of these was that of a notorious
character named McKay, and Prose
cuting Attorney Melvin stated that,
owing to the intelligence of the evi
dence of Cooney, conviction was easily
secured.
The little scandal was finally dis
posed of by the unanimous passage of
the following resolution:
Whereas, Charges were filed against
Officer T. B. Cooney with this board on
the 19th day of January, 1898; and,
Whereas, Said charges have been fully
investigated by said board and found to
be unsubstantiated by the evidence pro
duced; therefore, be it
Resolved, That said charges be, and
they are hereby dismissed; and be it fur
ther
Resolved, That in the judgment of this
board said Officer Cooney should be
transferred to another beat.

BERKELEY, Feb. 3.â Dr. X. ' C. Bab
cock of the history department of the
University of California gave this after
noon the first of a series of three lectures
on "Suggestions as to the Philosophy of
American History." He concluded:
"True, democracy can not be said to
have prevailed in American society un
til the present century, when the monop
oly of land in the colonial proprietorships
gave way to freedom of access to the
land, when an unlimited quantity of till
able land was open to all. This freedom
of land was the true basis of American
democracy."

Legal Battle of First Magnitude
Promised in the Ames-
Harris Suit.
OAKLAND, Feb. 3.â One of the fiercest
legal battles ever fought In the Superior
Court of this county is likely to be that
of Ann Harris against Joslah P. Amos.
The stake fought for is twenty-three in
terest-bearing bonfls of $1400 each of the
Cincinnati, Richmond and Fort Wayne
Railroad Company, twenty interest-bear
ing bonds of $1000 each of the Ohio and
West Virginia Railroad Company, being
an aggregate value of $43,000 and an ag
gregate annual interest of $3010.
The case came up to-day on a motion
for a continuance. The plaintiff is rep
resented by Bishop, Wheeler and Fitz
gerald, W. 11. Anderson, Raymond Ben
jamin and H. A. Treat. The defense will
be represented by Fox and Gray, A. A.
Moore and Everett Ames. Owing to the
illness of Mr. Fitzgerald and the absence
of Mr. Wheeler in Honolulu the defense
asked for a continuance. This the prose
cution refused to allow and the court
ordered the case to proceed at 9:30 o'clock
to-morrow morning.
The parties to the suit are brother and
sister and have lived together here for a
number of years and are well known.
She alleges that her brother sold the
bonds and appropriated the funds to his
personal use. This he denies and claims
that she gave them to him outright and
knew that they were to be â¢ sold. The
case was filed a year ago the first of this
month.

TWO LOWLY ARTISTS PASS
AWAY.
The Almshouse Poet and Fiddler Have
Gone to Their Rest.
Two artists, lowly, but wedded to the muses, went to their everlasting
rest, at ripe old ages, at the Almshouse Wednesday. One was the Alms
house poet, who had rhymed for sixty years past, and the other was
"Helm, the Fiddler," who, though 88 summers had passed his head, still
clung to his beloved violin and actually slept with it, they say.
The violinist was a peculiar character. He spent his time fiddling
until his business slipped through his hands to the tune of musical
strings, and then his wife fell away from him, and all because of the
fiddle.
Several months ago he wandered into the Health Office with the
violin under his arm and asked to be sent to ttte Almshouse, where a
humble cot might be his and where he might fiddle away the hours,
untrammeled by the necessity of seeking his daily bread. He told Sec
retary Godchaux how his worldly goods had fled, how his wife, who had
come to detest the fiddle, had left him, and then demonstrated his ability
by playing a few airs on the instrument. The genial secretary was
touched and Captain Reddy made him comfortable as long as he lasted.
The story of William E. Krause is somewhat similar, though it was
the poetic muse that landed him in the Almshouse. When business and
figures should have occupied his attention he was continually hunting
for a rhyme in which to arrange them, and, like Helm, fortune passed
by his door. He dreamed and rhymed until the institution where the
city's poor are cared for opened its portals to him and he became one
of those that have been.
He made verses, such as they were, almost to the day of his death,
and the records of the Health Office say that he died as he lived. They
Bimply chronicle the demise of William Krause, poet, age 73 years.
SEERS AND
SILVERWARE
Mrs. Bolton's Experience
With Two Wander
ing Gypsies.
Promise Her Charms and Ask
for Valuables, Which She
Gives Them.
Has an Idea That She May Have
Been Somewhat
Foolish.
ALAMEDA, Feb. B.â Mrs. Bolton of
Tregloan place, who has been taking a
chance at occult science under the tu
telage of a couple of gypsies, and
whose tale of woe was told in yester
day's Call, may be a relative of
"Lucky" Baldwin or she may not be.
Whichever the case, this much is cer
tain that the claim to consanguinity
with the muchly married individual
can never be based on anything con
nected with the sobriquet, for, accord
ing to her own tale, the only kind of
luck she has been having lately is
easily hard.
Yesterday at the Bolton residence
when a reporter called the door was
reluctantly opened and a mild man
nered little woman appeared, who bade
him enter.
With fear and trembling the visitor
found himself in a cosy little parlor
that looked all unsuited to the awful
invocations of the necromancer, though
it no doubt would prove a very pleas
ant lounging place to any casual spirit
from the vasty deep who might chance
to drop In after a hard night spent
with the boys in some adjacent grave
yard.
Mrs. Bolton did not want to be in
terviewed. She had been having trou
bles enough for the last few days. First
came the original gypsy, who told her
fortune, said something that sounded i
like "tick, tack, toe," touched her fore- j
head, then touched her silverware, to
the value of $65, and vanished.
Secondly, Just as Mrs. Bolton was
coming out of her trance, the figure of
the gypsy again appeared and said:
"Have you any jewelry?"
"No," said Mrs. Bolton. "I lost it all
in a fire."
"Have you any more silver?" again
asked the mystic.
"No."
"Well, give me that rose," pointing
to one on the mantle, "and you will be
lucky."
Mrs. Bolton gave it, and was lucky
that it was not more valuable.
Trouble No. 3 consisted in the ap
pearance of a witch, a sister to the first i
visitor. This companion of broom- \
sticks and dark nights, after informing I
Mrs. Bolton that she was destined to
become a great actress, prevailed upon
her to part with a large lock of her
hair for the furtherance of that ambi
tion; and after relieving her of an In
dian shawl, the only thing of any con
siderable value overlooked by the first
visitor, departed, promising to return
in a few days and supply her with a
charm of such potency that she would
be enabled to gratify any ambition,
from unraveling stitches to unveiling
, futurity.
"I may have been a Httle foolish,"
said Mrs. Bolton In conclusion, "but
I gave the thinga to the gypsies be
cause they asked me for them," which
is certainly a good reasonâ from the
gypsy's point of view.

STOPPED SHORT
Street Carmen Cannot Form

A Little Notice at the Market-Street
Office That Spoiled
It All.
NOTICEâ Any employe of the Market-street
Railway Company who organizes, attempts to
organize, joins or in any way is connected
with any club, society or organization, which

This notice was conspicuously posted
In the carhouse Of the Market Street
Railway company at Mission and Twen
ty-ninth streets, a few weeks ago, and
may frustrate the plans of about eighty
of the conductors and motormen of the
Mission street system to organize a
union for the protection of the street
railway employes.
Several weeks ago eighty of the con
ductors and motormen of the Mission,
Bryant and Brannan and Folsom street
car lines held a secret meeting to discuss
the advisability of forming- such an or
ganization. At the meeting those pres
ent were greatly in favor of organiza

tect members against "layoffs" for over
sleeps.
According to the rules of the Market
Street Company, if a conductor or mo
torman arrives at the carhouse two min
utes late, no matter what his excuse
may be, he is immediately laid off duty
for three days. For the second offense
within six month* he is given a vacation
for seven days, and for the third offense
within a half year he is discharged.
This rule, in particular, the organiza
tion was to force out of existence, if pos
sible.
All the employes of the company con
sulted immediately signitied their will
inpness to join and uphold thf> organiza
tion and all looked bright, until one of
the timers was consultedâ most of the
men claim it was Charles Ketch.
Ketch immediately opposed the organ
ization and a few days afterward Super
intendent Stein posted the notice.
The organization formed by the eighty
men has not as yet gone out of existence,
but it undoubtedly will, as the members
have been informed that they will be
given until February 15 to make up their
minds one way or the other.
One of the projectors and most earnest
supporters of the association yesterday
afternoon said: "The Market-street Rail
way Company treats its employes like
dogs and now when we make an attempt
to uphold our rights we are threatened
with being discharged from our positions.
Last week one of the motormen came to
the carhouse a few minutes late and was
discharged. His wife had been taken
suddenly ill and it was thought that she
would die. After summoning a physi
cian he sat up all night with her, and
near morning it was again necessary for
him to summon the physician, as the
woman's condition had become worse.
Naturally he was a few minutes late at
the carhouse in the morning, but the
timer would not accept the motorman's
explanation of the circumstance.
"That is one of the many wrongs our
association would have suppressed. We
merely ask that the men be given a fair
chance.
"I do not believe the association, though
only in its infancy, will disband, as all
the boys are in sympatnv with it. We
may surprise the railway officials."
GOVERNOR IS BUSY.
Time Given for the Worden Inquiry.
Vacant Place on the Railroad
Commission.
Governor Budd has given the physi
cians appointed to investigate concern
ing the mental condition of Worden un
til June 17 to complete their examination
of the case. Dr. Hatch recently visited
Worden at Folsom. Drs. Gardiner and
Hatch will probably go East to attend an
annual meeting of physicians, and while
there one will visit the scene of Worden' s
childhood and collect such information
as may be attainable in regard to the
case. The Governor is disposed to give
the medical authorities ample time to
consider and verify all the documents
recently transmitted from the East to
the Chief Executive of California.
The Governor was asked yesterday
when he proposed to fill the vacancy on
the Board of Railroad Commissioners. He
replied: "The appointment will not De
made at present. I have not had time
to consider the applications and hear the
statements on behalf of the applicants.
An opportunity, however, will be given
for a full discussion of the merits of ap
plicants before the appointment is made."
The Governor was asked if there were
applicants for the place othor than J. T.
Burke. Judge Lawler and James Barry.
He remarked that other names had been
favorably mentioned.
DRUGGISTS IN TROUBLE.
A Number of Them Arrested for
Selling Counterfeit Patent
Medicines.
A number of the druggists of the city
have already been arrested, and there are
warrants out for many more, charging
them with selling counterfeit patent
medicines. The brands which have been
counterfeited are Castoria and Carter's

SCORED ONE
FOR THE CUP
Mr. Skinner Won the j
Race for Gentlemen
Riders.
Judge Denny Downed a Nose
in the Stake Event by
Garland Barr.
Geyser Won Another Purse for Ed
Corrigan â George Miller Ran
Away From His Field.
The rare for gentlemen riders proved
4juite a fetching attraction in the way â 
of drawing out society to the races, j
On the verandas of the clubhouse at :
Jngleside yesterday the upper ten were ;
â well represented, and the Hobart tally
ho carried a jolly crowd of "rooters." j
But society cannot dictate in all things,
for fashion's favorite, Walter Hobart, j
riding the favorite. Our Climate, fin- j
ished last of the field. The distance |
was one mile and the prize an elegant j
silver cup, which must be won three j
times before it becomes the property of
the fortunate rider. Mr. Hobart's well j
known prowess in the saddle made Our
Climate the favorite, and although the :
young millionaire handled his mount â¢
well, Honig's horse faded away to
nothing in the stretch. Mr. Skinner's !
mount, Wawona, had many supporters, j
that clever rider having been returned i
the winner in several races of the kind
in the past, and they got all the coin.
The young newspaper scribe handled
his mount with the air of a profes
sional, and overtaking Mr. Dunphy
astride Triumph at the head of the
etretch, won easily by over half a
dozen lengths. Mr. Forsland, who was
cut off at the iirst turn with Dick :
Behan, came fast in the run home, !
beating Veragua, piloted by Mr. Sink,
four lengths for the place. The win
ner was 10 to 1 in the betting.
The racing was marxed by no un
usual features. Three favorites, a sec- i
ond choice and two outsiders captured '
the purses.
The San Rafael selling sweepstakes !
at one mile and three furlongs was de
cided and went to Garland Barr, which, ,
with Wheel of Fortune, ruled favorite !
in the betting. Judge Denny and Col- |
lins were the only other starters. Col- j
11ns, with Thorpe up, had speed for j
about a mile and cut out the running, i
Clawson then assumed the lead with
Judge Denny and looked all over the â 
winner when Jones challenged him
with Garland Barr, and in a long, hard
drive gained the decision by a long !
nose. "The Wheel" was last through- j
out.
Joe Ullman, the meek favorite for the
mile selling run, made a very poor
showing with his bad tendons, never
getting within hailing distance of the
leaders. Polish, a la to 1 shot ridden
by Master O'Connor, showed first to
the stretch, where Fashion Plate forged
to the front and won ridden out. Lena
finished third, three lengths behind
Polish.
The good form of Geyser was again
apparent in the last event, a seven
furlong run. Receding in the betting
from 4 to 5 to evens, the bay colt al
lowed the speedy Trolley to cut out a
great clip for two-thirds of the dis
tance, when he strode to the front and
found no difficulty in downing Orimar
over four lengths*. The latter just got
up in time to take the place from Trol
ley by a nose.
The faint-hearted Blarneystone went
to the post favorite for the opening six
furlong sprint. After leading to the
stretch he was passed and beaten out
easily by Hermoso, an 8 to 1 chance,
ridden by R. Narvaez. Valencienne
came from behind, securing the show.
The seven furlong selling run proved
p. gift for George Miller. Backed down
from twos to 6 to 5 he ran over the
top of his field and won, with Spencer
looking back at the nearest horse, Don
Fulano. The latter opened favorite at
odds of 7 to 5, receding to 2 to 1.

The number of bookmakers was increased to

THE SA^T FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 4, 1898.
WILLEY WAS IN
GOOD SPIRITS
No Reason Why He
Should Take His
Own Life.
There Was Nothing Unusual
in His Demeanor When
He Went to Bed.
Story of the Man Who Was Last in
His Room as Told at the
Inquest.
The Coroner's Inquest into the cause
of the death of Charles Walter Willey
was commenced yesterday morning.
The evidence taken showed no motive
for the suicide of the deceased nor
anything that would lead to the belief
that Willey had ever contemplated
such an act.
All the witnesses united in the dec
laration that he had been sober on the
evening before the day on which he
was found poisoned by the gas. His
landlady, Mrs. L. S. Harvey, said he
was most regular in his habits and
she considered him "one of my very
nice roomers; quiet and interfering
with no one."
Timothy J. Lyons, his attorney, was
with Willey in Lyons' office on the af
ternoon before the death of the de
ceased, and they spent an hour or so
in reading the Gospel of St. John in
Latin. They quit at half past 5
o'clock and Willey agreed to meet
Lyons again at the office at half past
8 in the evening. Lyons was detained
and did not reach the office until 9:05
or 9:10, and he was informed by the
janitor that Willey had been there
about five or ten minutes before and
had said he was going home.
L. S. Harvey, the landlord, told the
jury the door of Wllley's room had not
been locked, and when he traced the
odor of gas to Willey's apartment he
turned the knob and went in. The
single gas jet was fully open, but the
crevices in the transom, the window
and the door had not been stopped up,
and ther were no indications that
any attempt had been made to do so.
Willey had retired in the usual man
ner and was undressed and covered
with the bedclothes.
The deceased had had a visitor on
the evening before whom Mr. Harvey
had seen going to "Willey's room on
several occasions. This man had
culled on Willey at about 10 o'clock on
Friday evening, the evening before
his death. Harvey did not know his
name, but was familiar with his ap
pearance.
The man in question proved to be
Hugh Landels, a carpenter. He was
called to the witness stand and told the
Jury that he had frequently visited
Willey "because of his heart trouble."
Landels said he was passing by the
Estella lodging-house, at 1145 Mission
street, between half past 9 and 10
o'clock Friday night, and went into the
house with a boy, who was taking in
a pitcher of milk. He rang the bell
for the landlord, and was shown to
Willey's room. The room was dark
and the door was locked, and Landels
was turning away when Willey opened
the door and invited him in. The de
ceased had just got out of bed and
remarked that he had come home early
and had retired because he felt a little
fatigued. Landels said it was 10 o'clock
and he would not stay. He went out,

FOR LINCOLN DAY.
Elaborate Preparations for Its Ob
servance in the Schools.
The memory of President Lincoln,
whose birthday falls on Saturday, the
12th inst., will be patriotically honored by
the public school children of San Fran
cisco on the afternoon of the preceding
Friday. In all of the primary, grammar
and high schools pupils and teachers will
rally to the occasion. Superintendent
Webster has sent circulars to all the
schools, directing principals to make nec
essary preparation for the proper ob
servance of the day. Following is the
general programme suggested by W. W.
Stone, president of the Lincoln Monu
ment League:
Patriotic song and salute to the flag;
address; declamation, "Lincoln"; Lin
coln song; quotations from the sayings
of Abraham Lincoln, by pupils arising
in their places and repeating, one pupil
at a time; "Gettysburg Address," by a
pupil; poem. "Why Should the Spirit of
Mortal Be Proud?" (Lincoln's favorrte
poem); patriotic song; tableaux or group
ing, to represent historical events in the
life of Lincoln; unveiling (have a good
sized picture or bust of Lincoln on a
table, veiled. Let a pupil unveil it, giving
at the same time a previously prepared
speech); song. "Battle Hymn": remarks
by visiting veterans and Invited guests;
"America.
In the evening there will probably be a
gathering of citizens, at which the Mayor
will be invited to preside. A Lincoln song,
â written expressly for the occasion, will
be sung.
A False Alarm.
John Carey of Siskiyou County, com-
plained to Captain Bohen yesterday that
he had been robbed of $70 and a gold
watch and chain. He had been sampling
the liquor in the "tenderloin district" and
was kept till his friends were communi
cated with. They called and told the
captain that they had taken the money
and watch from him as they were afraid
he might lose them. Carey was handed
over to them and will be sent home to
day.

PUPIL'S FACE
Mrs. Chalmers, Principal
of the Edison School,
to Be Arrested.
She Is Accused of Mistreating
Laura Chase, a 1O- Year-
Old Girl.
The Latter's Sister Will Swear to a
Complaint Against the Offend
ing Teacher,
Mrs. Chalmers, principal of the Edi
son Primary School at Church and Hill
streets, is. to be arrested to-day on a
charge of battery. She is accused of
slapping Laura Chase, aged 10 years,
in the face with her open hand simply
because she had made a "mistake" in
her studies. Last night the sister of
the girl visited police headquarters and
asked that a warrant be issued for the
arrest of Mrs. Chalmers.
"I think it is an outrage that an in
nocent girl should bo subjected to
such treatment," she remarked. "Mrs.
Chalmers could have punished her in
some other way without attempting to
disgrace her in the eyes of the other
pupils by slapping her face.
"My sister is rather small for her
age, and as far as I know she is a
model pupil. Last Monday she hap
pened to make some mistake in her
studies, when the principal, who Was
examining her, walked down the aisle
and deliberately struck her In the face
with her open hand.
"The poor girl was in a condition
bordering on hysteria when she
reached home, and as she is without a
mother I concluded to take up her
fight if for nothing more than to teach
Mrs. Chalmers that she has no right
to slap a child's face. If she had rep
rimanded her or even chastised her In
a mild way I would not have felt so
bad."
Miss Chase was advised to see the
Superintendent of Schools and if her
story was found to be correct to file
charges against the offending princi
pal.
"I want her punished by the court,"
she remarked, with an angry toss of
her head. "Mrs. Chalmers has com
mitted an unwarranted assault on my
sister, and I ask that she be made to
suffer the consequences."
The indignant sister was told she
could procure a warrant for her ar
rest on a charge of battery, which she
threatened to do this morning.

LAPIQUE ESCAPES PBISON.
The Supreme Court Holds That He
Did Not Commit Embezzlement,
By a decision banded down in the Su
preme Court yesterday John Laptque will
not don stripes. Lapi>!"e was convicted
in the Superior Court on the charge of
embezzling $300 from a Mrs. Mespel, who
Intrusted him with the sale of her fur
nished houso. The Bale was made, and
instead of $1150, the ;.riee she authorized
him to take, he obtained $1450, and kept
the defference. For so doing she had him
arrested and the jury found him guilty.
The Supreme Court reversed the ver
dict, holding that his defense of retaining
the amount should have been considered.

WALLER ACCUSED
OF DEALING IN
TEACHERS' PLACES
Attorney Eli Sheppard Testifies Before the
Grand Jury That the School Director
Offered to Sell a Position to
Him for $500.
The Accused Man Denies It and Says the Charges Have Been
Ventilated by Previous Juriesâ Director Hammond's
Conduct In Office Is Under Inves
tigation.
The Grand Jury has commenced an investigation into the official
conduct, or misconduct, of several of the membersof the Board of Educa
tion. Nearly the whole of yesterday's session of the inquisitorial body
was occupied in probing into charges of alleged fraud on the part of
two of the Directors, and hints were given that if the Grand Jury
desired there was much in the administration of the School Depart
ment that could occupy their attention, and many flagrant wrongs
could be corrected.
Assertions have been made that places in the School Deparment
were for sale and that promotions of teachers to responsible and
lucrative positions have been made by monetary influence. It has also
been said that friends of the Directors have been given coveted places,
not for their ability, but for other reasons. Persons from other coun
ties in the State have been brought to the city and made vice-princi
pals of schools over the heads of teachers who have served for years
in the San Francisco School Department, and who have long demon
strated greater ability for the positions than those to whom they were
given.
The investigation of yesterday pointed the finger of suspicion of
misconduct toward Directors Waller and Hammond, and it is said
others will be among the proscribed before the inquiries are ended.
Eli Sheppard, an attorney, testified
before the Grand Jury yesterday that
Samuel L. Waller, one of the Board of
School Directors, offered to secure a
position for his daughter as a school
teacher for the sum of $500.
Sheppard said under oath that on
May 5 of last year he went to the store
of the schc-ol director and there had' a
conversation with Julian Waller, a
brother of Samuel, on school matters
and the methods at securing positions
as teachers. Sheppard says he was in
formed that there was a way to do it
and that a hint was given him to the j
effect that such positions were for sale, j
N<M. long afterward Sheppard says he |
saw Samuel Waller and broached the !
subject to him. Waller replied that ;
there was considerable expense in put
ting a teacher on the pay roll of the j
department, and after some hesitation !
the director said the cost would amount
to about ?"00 and for that sum he would
secure the desired appointment for i
Miss Sheppard.
School Director Waller says Shep
pard's story is an old one with Grand
Juries. In December Sheppard told
the tale to the Grand Jury that was
recently discharged and that body, af
ter a full hearing, dismissed the com
plaint. Sheppard's testimony at that
time was unsupported and he could
bring nothing to bear him out in his
charges. Waller was called before the
Grand Jury and he testified that he had
never to his knowledge ever seen Shep
pard until they met in the Juryroom.
"Since I have been a school director,"
GRIFEO BESTED
ON POINTS
How Frank McConnell
Defeated the Clever
Australian.
Fifteen Rounds of Fancy Fisti
cuffs Where No Gore
Was Shed.
Jlramle La-wlor Put " Cocker "
Tweedle to Sleep In Three
Rounds.
Yotms Griffo, the Australian light
weight champion pugilist, proved to
the satisfaction of expert boxers and
Judges of pugilism last evening, in the
gymnasium of the Olympic Club, that
he was one of two things, viz.: a
phenomenally clever lad at hippo
dromlng or a man who has retrograd
ed very much during the past few
years of warm living and high dissi
pation. â¢
Griffo "the great" â that is, as a
master of the manly art â met Frank
McConnell of the San Francisco Ath
letic Club in a fifteen-round bout,
which was witnessed by a large gath
ering of Olympic Club members and
their friends, who had paid a fee of
$2 50, which was the price of admis
sion charged for outsiders.
McConnell was in superb condition;
in fact, he looked as If he were trained
a shade too fine.
It will be remembered that some
weeks ago the men were booked to fight
in Vallejo, but owing to the Insignifi
cant sum that was taken in at the gate
McConnell refused to "go on," and in
hfs place was substituted a Vallejoite
named Lewis, a big husky middle
weight, who proved to be a first-class
chopping block for the Australian.
The Olympic Club, however, feeling
that considerable interest would be ta
ken in a match between McCcmnell and
Griffo, signed tha men a few weeks
ago, and as previously stated Griffo
played successfully the "old rocks"
game or satisfied his admirers that dis
sipation that landed him among the
army of good old timers.
McConnell, who recently joined the
professional ranks, is unquestionably a
very promising colt, but his - blows '- are
â teamless glroply. Jiecaasa Jtxez we joot
said Waller yesterday, "scores of per
sons have called on me and offered to
pay me for securing position for them
or their relatives or friends with the
School Board. As soon as even a sug
gestion of offering any pecuniary com
pensation for a position was made, I
diligently avoided all further inter
course with such persons, recognizing
them as dangerous characters."
Julian Waller stated that he never
had any such conversation with Mr.
Sheppard and said further that when
ever anybody addressed him on school
matters he always professed his ignor
ance of such matters, and referred
them to his brother without inquiring
in the slightest degree as to the nature
of their business.
The Grand Jury has expressed a de- i
termination of probing deeply into the ,

Bchool Superintendent Webster was
asked for information on the matter i
yesterday. He told of a man named |
Kreutzner who was appointed as vice- j
principal of the Hearst Grammar
School after only a few months' service !
in the department. Attention was called !
to the actions of Director Hammond, j
who insisted that the Board of Exam
iners agree to the appointment of one
of his friends, a man named Copeland,
as teacher of draughting in one of the
schools. Copeland had failed on three
successive occasions of passing the
necessary examination and the Board
of Examiners refused to agree to his
occupying the place.
The Grand Jury will meet again to
night when the complaints accusing Su

conduct in office will be considered. It
is thought that the complaints will be
simply received and referred to com
mittees for preliminary investigation.

Time and again he planted his right on
Griffo's ribs under the left arm. but I
with the exception of imparting a red j
mark to the spot where his glove land- j
ed the effect of the blows did not seem
to annoy the invader very much. In
fact, Griffo remarked after the congest
that the pleasure taps were stimu
lating.
But Griffo with his nasal appendage
managed to stop some left hand smash
es that caused him to blink and wonder
how McConnell contrived to get inside
of his famous guard.
The Australian's clever ducking was
a revelation to the members of the
club. Time and again he shot his bul
let head under the left wing of his
opponent when avoiding swinging
blows, but instead of planting his
lightning left, as is his custom, three
or four times in succession on the
face of his opponent before executing
the back step Griffo slid away to
either side of McConnell and fiddled
like a dancing master in front of his
long-armed adversary.
Time and again Griffo could have
easily crossed McConnell, but he
failed to take advantage of a single
opening. The Australian guarded his
chin beautifully with his shoulder and
was seemingly satisfied to take all
the ribroasters that were aimed at
him.
Occasionally Griffo let out a link or
so and planted his left on his oppon
ent's nose as a reminder, but none of
the blows was what could be termed
wicked, excepting the swings aimed to
land within an inch or so of McCon
nell's jaw.
The local man is, nevertheless, a very
shifty and clever fighter, and he should
have stopped the Australian had there
been any steam in his punches.
On points McConnell won the match
easily. Griffo played a very clever
defensive game. The referee, Phil
Wand, gave a good decision when he
awarded the contest to McConnell on
points.
Young Jimmy Lawlor made short
work of "Cocker" Tweedie.
The local lad had the better of the
first round, but in the second round
Tweedie opened fire and was doing
gocd seryice when he was sent to the
boards a completely knocked-out man
from the effects of a right-hand smash
on the point of the jaw. Tweedie
missed a left swing at Lawlor's Jaw,
and as the glove shot past the mark
Lawlor sent out a straight right
which won him a short but handsome
victory.

MASTER OF ARTS
DEGREE TO STAND
A Vexed Question Temporarily
Settled at the Stanford
University.
But the Close Vote Is Taken to
Indicate That the "A. M."
Is Doomed.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PALO ALTO, Feb. 3.â The deadlock
in the university council over the
measure to abolish the Master of Arts
degree at Stanford was broken to-day
when the envelopes containing the
votes of the eight members present at
the last meeting were opened. By a
vote of 22 to 21 the recommendation of
the majority of the graduation com
mitte was rejected and the master's
degree must stand for the present.
The considerations that led the ma
jority of the council to favor the mi
nority report of the graduation com
mittee handed in by Professor Ernest
Pease, head of the Latin department,
were based on the belief that the abo
lition of the degree would work a hard
ship on both the university and the
students who expect to try for an "A.
M." They contended that a student do
ing graduate work studied better with
a degree in prospect. It was held also
to bring to Stanford a very desirable
class of students, a great many of
whom the university would lose if the
degree was abolished. The commercial
value of the degree to students who
wish to teach also weighed with the
council.
The close vote on this important
matter plainly shows that the "A. M."
at Stanford is doomed. The innovation
will undoubtedly gain strength among
the members of the faculty, for the
arguments against it, for instance, that
it is largely an honorary degree, and
for practical purposes obsolete, are
vital thrusts at its retention in a col
lege unhampered by the traditions and
rubbish under which most institutions
are struggling
LAID TO REST BY
MANY MOURNERS
Imposing Funeral of the Late
Thomas L. Thompson at
Santa Rosa.
Largest Procession Ever Seen In the
Cityâ lmpressive Services at
Church and Grave.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Feb. 3.â The
funeral of the late Thomas Larkin
Thompson, whose terrible death by his
own hand on Tuesday morning shock
ed the entire State, took place this
afternoon under the auspices of the
Masonic order, assisted by the Odd Fel
lows and the members of Santa Rosa
Typographical Union No. 31.
The religious services were held at
the Church of the Incarnation on Men
docino street at 2 o'clock, and as the
guard of honor detailed by Santa Rosa
Commandery, Knights Templar, to es
cort the bo-dy from McTavish Hall to
the church, drew up in front of that
edifice, the cortege was received by
Rector James Cope and his vested choir
at the entrance. The body was pre
ceded up the aisle by Rector Cope and
jhe choir and aa tne^casfcet was borne
up the steps it wap between a double
row of six Knights each with drawn
swords and lifted headdress.
The church services were brief, but
very impressive, and at their conclu
; sic.-n the cortege wended its way to
Rural Cemetery. A large concourse
'â â  of friends both on foot and in carriages
followed the deceased diplomat to his
i last resting place, and on every hand
were seen evidences of the deepest re
gret at his untimely end. The proces
| sion was the largest ever seen in this
i city, and in it were seen prominent per
sonages from all parts of the State.
The pall bearers accompanying the
hearse were selected from the Blue
Lodge, CommanderyandOdd Fellows as
follows: A. B. Ware, John S. Taylor,
H. C. FRANKS, the Pennsylvanian Who Was Lured to This City by
a Marriage Broker.
O. H. Hoag, Dr. R. P. Smith, Col. M. X

The impressive services of the Ma
sonic order were conducted at the grave
I by Worthy Master W. B. Griggs of the
Blue Lodge, and Rev. James Cope and
George Rogers, noble grand of the Odd
Fellows, also made appropriate re
marks.

ISAAC BAIN
AT IT AGAIN
A Marriage Personal
Lures a Guileless East
erner to This Coast.
The Woman .Accomplice in the
Scheme Well Known in
Certain Circles.
But the Plans Miscarried and the
Prospective Groom Will Depart
for Home.
There arrived in this city on the
overland train last night a gentleman
by the name of H. C. Franks, who had
traveled all the way from Bradford,
Pa., and Judging from the motive that
actuated him Jin coming such a long
distance it would seem that marriage
able ladies are few and 'far: between in
his locality, for he braved the discom
forts |of an overland journey with the
intention of marrying a lady whom he
had never seen and to whom' he had
plighted his troth by mail. This would
appear to be a romantic courtship on
the surface, but : the romance fades
away when the â  true inwardness of
the facts become known.
The preliminary bait that lured this
unsophisticated individual ' to ... this
coast was the appearance on January
9, 1897, of two . personals in a local
Journal of recognized saffron tinge
which read as follows: â.-.'â¢â -â

WIDOW, aged 34, . owns a large ranch, wishes

aging the ranch; object matrimony. Box 6024
Kxamlner.
It is not known -which one of these
attracted the attention of Franks
nor to which one he responded, but
probably it was the second, because
the inducements were greater. Suf
fice it to say that he did open up a
correspondence, and considering that
he had never met the lady he -wrote
in a tender, loving strain something
in the following style:
, M 7.J? ear Unknown: Although you are
invisible to me something tells me that
you are my affinity, and I long to tell you
of my love for you. I am very weary of
living alone, with nothing but solitude
for companionship, and it will only be
necessary to tell me where to find you
and I will go to you as quick as steam
will take me. I will say that money is
not so much of an object to me as love
for without love life is dreary and deso
late. Answer this as soon as you receive
It and I will immediately make arrange
ments to go to you, as I long to clasp you
in my arms.
P. S.â l have always had a liking for
widows and I have a matter of $2000,
which will accompany me on my trip, so
our honeymoon may be made a pleasur
able one.
Now the little matter of the $2000
evidently had an uncommon attraction !
for the widow, who desired to take an- i
other whack at the matrimonial lot- j
tery, for she hastened to respond. In j
her correspondence she said that she \
was a little diffident about meeting !
strangers, but nothing would give her ;
greater pleasure than to make the ac- '
quaintance of the writer. As to her i
physical accomplishments, she weighed
136 pounds, was of medium height, of
good form, had large, expressive eyes,
golden , brown hair, small feet and
hands and her friends called her pood
looking. She added "by way of no â 
harm that she was possessed of $35,000,
which her lately deceased husband had
left her before making his exit to an
other and happier sphere."
This settled the business, and the
courtship which commenced less than a
month ago was to have had its culmi
nation on the arrival of the prospective
groom last night, but it is to be hoped ;
that when he learns how he was cruelly
imposed upon by two schemers he will
lose no time in hieing himself away !
from here and return to his native
heath a wiser if a sadder man.
The lady in the case is Mrs. Grace
Allison, who resides at room 20, 415
Jones street, and she formerly lived at
29 Grant avenue. She also advertised
in a matrimonial paper called "Wed
ding Bells," published at 111 Ellis
street. In that paper she appeared
as "No. 291" and represented herself as
a Jewess born in San Francisco. She
moves in a circle hardly recognized as
select by connoisseurs in social ethics,
and there is no doubt that she, together
with her male accomplice, intended to
fleece Franks just as soon as he would
set foot on our hospitable shore.
This will be readily seen when it is
known that the name of the broker,
who conducted the negotiations, was
Isaac Bain, whom The Call exposed in
its issue of Sunday, October 3, 1897, for
conducting a fraudulent marriage bu
reau,, .which had the good, effect of
causing that individual of malodorous
memory to cease his nefarious prac
tices. He then conducted the Pacific
Coast Information Agency at 110 Ellis
street under the alias of H. C. Curtis,
and his star matrimonial attraction at
that time was an Indian maiden with
a fabulously rich gold mine, and that
the bait took was evinced by the fact
that a number of business men from
all parts of the country, and even a
count from across the "pond" offered
their hearts and hands to the maiden,
or maybe it was the gold minp.
Isaac Bain has been in the clutches
of the law more than once and ho ex
periences his greatest difficulty in keep
ing out of jail. He was a year in a
Los Angeles prison, for a marriage bu
reau swindle of which he was the head
and was put in the Alameda County
Jail for the same offense. On August
1, 1894, he was sent to San Quentin for
two years for conducting the Acme i
Marriage Bureau.
