VOLUME LXXXIII.â NO. 118.
Birdseye View of the Waters Between Cuba and Porto Rico, Showing the Strategic
Value of the Proposed Station for the American Squadron at
Samana Bay, on the Eastern End of Hayti.
Opening upon Mona Passage between Hayti and Porto Rico, within sight of the hills of the latter, and .icar the open water on the north through which
lies the direct route from San Juan, Porto Rico, to Havana, Samana Bay offers the very best point of observation of the movements of the
Spanish torpedo fleet now expected at San Juan to await orders from Havana or Madrid and whose presence is considered a menace to the
plans and interests of the United States Government Well begirt with high hills on all sides but one, and with a large stretch of water rang
ing from five to thirty fathoms in depth, Samana Bay can afford safe and convenient anchorage to the navies of the world. There is not a finer
* harbor in all the West Indies or the adjoining coasts. Santa Barbara on the northern side of the bay has telegraphic connection with Porto Playa
on the northern coast of Hayti, whence a direct cable line to New York owned by an American company gives ready communication between
the authorities at Washington and the commander of the squadron in the bay. Porto Playa has cable connections also with Havana via Santiago
de Cuba, and with Spain via San Juan, Antigua, Cayenne (French Guiana), Pernambuco (Brazil) and the Canaries to Cadiz. These lines are all
owned by English companies.
SPAIN'S
LATEST
INSULTS
Pretending to Make Liberal
Offers to Cubans While
Sparring for Time.
NEW YORK, March 27.â The
Herald's Washington correspon
dent telegraphs: While the ca
ble is hot with war news from
Madrid the air of Washington is
fogged with talk of peace. Spain
is after more time. At the White
House and Spanish Legation
they are chasing a will-o'-the
wisp of peace in Cuba cm the ba
sis of even more liberal auton
omy. Congress is waiting for
the Maine report and promises
to be tranquil for a short time
longer.
The explosion may come at any min
ute, but they say in administration cir
cles that the outlook is better. It may
be that the administration only hopes
it will be better. This is what has
been going on while Madrid has been
talking of war.
Through her Minister, Senor de Ber- j
nabe, Spain to-day asked for further j
delay before the United States did any- j
thing about Cuba, and promised that :
she would lay before the State Depart
ment at an early day following the i
Spanish elections her plan for a more
liberal government of the island. This j
statement the Spanish Minister colored j
with rainbows of the most roseate hues. ,
It would be such a plan, so fair, so lib- i
eral, so alluring that the United States ;
â would not fail to accept it. It would;
have such attractions for insurgents j
that Gomez and all his followers would J
Immediately lay down their arms, j
Peace would reign In Cuba. Plenty/

ever.
If this proposition came at any other
time. It might have a more important
bearing on the situation. Coming now
when the Spanish elections are being
held, when the Maine report is about
to go to Congress, and a crisis con
fronts the peace of the administration

ing the starving and ending the 'var â
no man living knows how â no one who
knows of these new overtures thinks
he should be blamed for being skepti

the only persons who are not skeptical
are the President and diplomats of
Spain. The President wants more
time. He believes that war can by
averted, and with characteristic pa
tience is ready to consider everything
that might lead to a peaceful solution
of the question. Spain's promised prop
osition is based on a successful out
come for the Sagasta Ministry in the
elections which are held to-day.
The Spanish legation asserts that
Sagasta has won the Cortes. Details
of this plan were not made known to

that Spain could not yield her sover

GERMANY HAS MUCH
SYMPATHY FOR SPAIN
Belief That the Madrid Government Is
Guilty of Negligence, but Public
Opinion Against American
Interference in Cuba.
LONDON, March 27.â A dispatch to the Observer from Berlin says the imminent danger
of war between the United States and Spain is the absorbing topic of discussion. Until recently
political and financial circles refused to credit the probability of war, but the report of the Maine
Commission dissipated this skepticism. There is great depression on the Bourse.
German opinion may be summarized by saying that it refuses to believe that a mine was
exploded. It regards the case as one of negligence on the part of Spain, for which the United
States is entitled to compensation, but Spain's claims on account of the filibustering expeditions
must also be allowed. No German credits the genuineness of the American measures against
these expeditions or the indignation of Americans over Spanish cruelties in Cuba. Irfdeed, opinion
here resents American intervention as impertinence and would, in case of war, sympathize outspok
enly with Spain, but would at the same time preserve the strictest neutrality.

THE CAUSE
Report of the Naval
Court on Maine
Disas ter.
WASHINGTON, March 27.â
The Associated Press presents
herewith a complete abstract of
the report of the court of in-
Â® quiry which Investigated the Â®
Â® wreckage of the battle-ship Â®
Â® Maine. This abstract is made Â®
Â® from the report itself, access to Â®
Â® which was obtained to-day de- Â®
Â® spite official sec cy unparalleled Â®
Â® in the handling of official papers. Â®
The report is made up of eight parts,
as follows:
Firstâ The court finds that at the
time of the explosion the battle -hip
Maine was lying in five and one-half
to six fathoms of water.
Secondâ The discipline aboard the
ship was excellent; everything stowed
according to orders â ammunition, guns,
stores, etc. The temperature of the
magazine at 8 p. m. was nominal, ex
cept in the after ten-inch magazine,
and that did not explode.
Thirdâ The explosion occurred at 9-:40
o'clock on the evening of February 15.
There were two explosions, with a very
short interval between them. The ship
lifted on the first explosion.
Fourth.â The court can form no den
nite opinion of ie condition of the
wreck from the divers' evidence.
Fifthâ The technical details of the
wreckage, from which the court de
duces that a mine was exploded under
the ship on the port side.
Sixth â The explosion was due to no
fault of those on board.
Seventh â Opinion of the Court, stat
in"' that the explosion of the mine
caused the explosion of the two maga
zines.
Eighthâ The Court declares that it
cannot find evidence to fix responsibil
ity.
The report is unanimous and is sign
ed by all the members of the Court. It
does not refer to the existence or non
existence of the mine in the harbor of
Havana except in the specific finding
that a mine was exploded under the
ship, and the explosion of the two mag
azines was caused by the explosion of
a mine.
The report as a whole is a formal,
dispassionate recital of facts and bears
the stamp of that strict officialism
which marks naval procedure. It is
brief, not exceeding ISOO words, and

MADRID, March 27.â Madrid is
ringing with patriotic outbursts. Spain
has taken a stand which is apparently

it will neither accept the money offer for j

BERLIN, March 27. â The Madrid correspondent of the
Frankfort Zeitung says: Senor Gullon, the Minister of For
eign Affairs, has informed me that an extremely threatening
note has arrived from Washington regarding the cessation of
war in Cuba. He added: "No matter how one regards the
affair, a rupture can now hardly be avoided."
The Madrid correspondent of the Berliner Tageblatt says:
Spain will not only refuse to allow American interference in
assisting suffering Cubans, but will decline to pay indemnity
unless it is shown unmistakably that the Spanish authorities
were responsible for the Maine explosion. If President McKin

The entire country is unanimous ta

assertion that the Carlists are disloyal
is as wide of the truth as the silly state
ment that the Southern States of the

Gullon, while firmly believing in up
holding the dignity of the nation, is
still busy racking his brains to suggest
some peaceable solution. He is the

To-day he would only say, "I do not

There are many silly statements sent
from here, and few among them should
be dignified by denial. One, however,
which stated that Gullon had denied

has been very mischievous. I am

SIGNIFICANT
WORK PROCEEDS
ON THE SABBATH
Mechanics Labor Day and Night at the
Mare Island Navy-Yard, and There
Is No Lull in the War
Preparations.
VALLEJO. March 27.â One shift worked in the navy yard to-day
from 7 a. ra. to 6 p. m. The executive offices were all closed, but the
shops were running as if there never were such a thing as Sunday,
and the day so gained is held to be of more importance than any one
In authority will admit. The ordnance department has the most sig
nificant order issued in the last few days. Some fine, new six-pound
ers of the latest model had arrived for the secondary batteries of the
Charleston find the Philadelphia, but they had no sooner arrived at
the yard than orders came from Washington to ship them back to
the Norfolk navy yard, and # not only the new ones, but also those
that had been carried by the Charleston, Philadelphia and Yorktown,
twelv.e or fourteen in all. Where the cruisers will get other small
guns has not been explained by the department, but the guns will go
back along with the new ones to help arm Eastern emergency craft.
The registry department has been bothered by hordes of men from
all over the State, who want to offer services of no use to the yard,
â al house carpenters, all the way from San Diego, offered them
lay, and were much disappointed when their services
â were refused. What the yard wants are shipjoiners, shipwrights, riv
eters, drillers, and machinists and painters, and ordinary carpenters
cannot be given work.
Retired officers are putting themselves in active and constant com
munication with the department, offering their services, and the re
cruiting station on the Independence is doing a rushing business.
Captain Kempff is to be detached from that ship, and will probably
be ordered East. He was assigned to the Monterey, but after Cap
tain Clark, his junior in rank, was given the Oregon, he made objec
tion to the inferior command, and so he will probably be sent East.
The pass regulations are now stricter than they have ever been be
fore. No one but Captain Glass, commandant of the yard, may issue
a pass, and even such a permit especially mentions that the bearer
may not go in the shops or upon ships out of commission when work
is boing done. More men are coming and preparations are being made
to keep work going twenty-four hoyrs a day.
a Ministerial statement, but unauthor
ised newspaper talk. I made inquiries
in high quarters to ascertain what re
ception would be accorded any propo
sition from the United States for send
ing further supplies to Cuba to be dis
tributed by Americans. I learn that the
probable reply will be that such sup
plies now sent by the Fern will be re
ceived, but any request for the sending
of further supplies will be refused on
tho ground that they are unnecessary.
Minister Woodford still professes to
believe that war can be averted. On
Friday he said to the editor of Epoca
that President McKinley desired peace
between the United States and Spain.
Commenting upon this, a high person
age remarked that it was not words
but deeds that would convince Spain
and Europe. Spain has done every
thing in her power to preserve the
peace and wishes to avoid the horrors
of war. It is even now in the power of
the North American republic to procure
and maintain peace.
Sagasta's organ, the Liberal, in an
article evidently inspired says: "Spain
will tolerate neither armed nor peaceful
intervention of the United States. Peo
ple like the Spaniards, who respect
themselves and who have been some
thing in the world, neither traffic with
honor nor speculate with shame. We
all wish and invoke peace; if others
disturb it with motives no fault of ours
we accept the consequences without ar
rogance or apprehension."
The entire press takes the same view.
The Saturday evening Correo, a paner
which has the ear of the Ministry, says:
"God knows if matters are becoming
worse, which is possible, but the provo
cation is notorious and scandalous, and
if onerous conditions are proposed to
us, the country, en masse, faithful to
its traditions, will repel them."
All sorts of rumors were current on
the Stock Exchange, rind when it was
announced that Minister Bernabe had
been handed his passports there was a
serious panic.
The Heraldo. the most important
evening paper, had a leading article
headed "El Conflicto, in which it says:
"We have small hopes of restraining
the tide of public feeling. War is in
the air we breathe. War is in every
conscience; it presents itself in a hun
dred different forms, and never has
provocation invented more tortures to
make people forget all prudence. In a
thousand ways has the American Gov
eminent violated our sovereignty in

those. Does the United States con

among the eight points, goes to the
greatest under the second, which deals
with the discipline of the ship.
Then the Court explains with ex
treme minuteness, the least detail, the
satisfactory condition of everything on
board being given. Th<* normal tem
perature of the large forward maga
zine at S o'clock â only an hour and
furty-flve minutes before the explo
sion â disposes of the question of acci
dental combustion within these maga
zlnos. While the Court holds that these
magazines did not txplodo from inter
nal causes, they nevertheless are of the
opinion that the explosion of the mine
under the port side of the ship caused
the explosion of the two magazines.
This will explain the remarkable de
struction wrought, the explosion thus
being shown to have combined the
force of a mine without and the two
magazines within. The two explosions
which the Court finds to have occurred
with a very Fhort interval between
them, is an additional detail showing
that two forces operated in causing
the destruction. The finding that the
ship lifted on the first explosion indi
cates an external source, and one of
tremendous power to be able to lift a
battleship of thousands of tons. The
character of the wreckage, technically
decribed in the fifth part of the report,
from which the Court deduces that a
mine was exploded under the ship on
the port side, sustains the view taken
by some experts shortly after the dis
aster, that the force of the explosion
was exerted from port to starboard.
The feature of the report of deepest
Interest to the navy is the complete
exoneration of Captain Slgsbee and all
on board, contained in the second find
ing, setting forth the perfect order and
discipline prevailing on the ship, and
more directly stated in the sixth find
ing, which declares the disaster to be
due to no fault of those on board.
The inability of the Court to find evi
dence to fix the responsibility, as stated
in the eighth part, makes the report so
guarded in expression of blame that
neither Spain nor the Spanish are men
tioned throughout.

MADRID, March 27.â The latest in

occasioned a great patriotic movement
throughout Spain. A large number of
persons have announced their inten
tion t6 give up a day's pay for services
to raise a fund to purchase a war
ship. A committee, over which the

ing said:
"President McKlnley does not inspire
me with confidence. He thinks himself
the first statesman in the world. He
is proud and vain, and his great vanity
makes him believe himself a Napoleon,
when in reality he is an ignorant sut
ler."
It is reported that the Conservatives
intend to propose that the troops in
the interior of Cuba should withdraw
to the coast until the autonomists and
faeparatists arrive at an agreement, but
it is not expected that the Cortes will
entertain such a proposal. The situa
tion in Cuba is declared to-day to be

Notwithstanding rain fell for the

SPAIN'S LATEST
INSULT
Continued from First Page.
into effect a government over which
the mother country would exercise a
most limited authority. It is described
as something half way between au
tonomy and suzerainty.
It was also definitely stated at this
interview that the purchase by Cuban
insurgents of their independence was
out of the question. Spain would never
consider the hauling down of her flag
by peaceful means. Spanish honor
could not entertain for a moment the
payment of money for Cuba. This
subject was fully gone into, because
the plan of eminent financiers to lend
Cuban insurgents $200,000,000 to buy
their independence and to guarantee
the Spanish-Cuban war debt has been
completed. It is stated on good author
ity that Henry W. Cannon and Colonel
Paine of New York came here yester
day with this information. The Span
ish Minister said no proposition of the
kind could ever be entertained by
Spain. That ended the plan of the
financiers and Mr. Cannon and Colonel
Paine have gone home.
Minister Barnabe could hold out no
promise as to how soon the new plan
could be expected to end the trouble
in Cuba, nor have any satisfactory as
surances that the insurgents would be
pleased with this any more than with
autonomy. It was all rainbow prom
ises.
When the representations of the
Spanish Minister were conveyed to the
President they seemed to impress him.
In the face of the disquieting news
from Madrid and other European capi
tals that Spain will not even sanction
our continuing to give relief to the
Cubans, the President sent for several
members of his Cabinet and began seri
ously to canvass the question whether
the country would be satisfied with
the Spanish proposition when it came;
whether Congress could be controlled or
prevented from smashing the Presi
dent's peace policy in disgust, and
whether the Cuban insurgents could be
induced through the "unfriendly office"
of the United States to consent to the
continuance of Spanish dominion under
changed conditions.
Information that the President is dis
posed to acquiesce in the Spanish prop
osition comes from an official in a po
sition to speak. He has been dis
couraged from many quarters to-night.
In every human probability the Span
ish Minister will to-morrow be told that
the United States cannot pledge itself
to indorse any policy that Spain may
offer short of the granting of inde
pendence to Cuba.
That will end the will-'o-the-wisp.
But it is not doubted by those near the
President that he will consent to giving
Spain more time if Congress and pub
lic opinion will support him. He is.
willing to go to extremes, short of sur
render, on the question of feeding the
innocent victims of war in Cuban
towns, if Congress will let him go. On
that it is believed there will be a clash
unless Spain recedes from the position
she is reported by tÃte Herald cable
fr>;m Madrid to have taken.
There is no change in th>> plan of the
President about sending relief. If Con
gress is quiescent to-morrow over the
Maine report hÂ»- will on Tuesday ask
for not less than $500,000 and possibly
$1,000,000 for relief purposes. The 'sug
gestion from the advocates of peace at
any price that it might be less "dis
quieting" to ask for $200,000 as a "start
er" has be^n spurned by the President.
If Spain objects to the sending of food
and clothing then the United Staes will
insist, and Snaln can take the respon
sibility fur declaring war if that be
deemed wise in Madrid. So insistent is
the President on this, bo continually do
his personal friends bring this up in
conversation, that it is clear he desires
should war be inevitable that It shall
come over the question of sending re
lief.
Should the Spanish Government ob
ject to this relief then steps will be ta
ken to overcome this objection forcibly,
if necessary. Should the Spanish Gov
ernment hamper the distribution of re
lief, all the power of the United States
Government will be exerted to sweep
these impediments away.
There is noticeable here a change in
the sentiment throughout the country
on the question of war. Business in
terests have noticeably receded from
their stand taken some time ago that
war should be averted at all hazards.
Letters members of the Cabinet are re
ceiving all breathe the hope that the
Cuban question shall be grot out of the
way. They are almost unanimous in
the opinion that if the question can not
be taken away peaceably it must be
taken away with war. They are will
ing to follow the President, no matter
what the outcome may be, but to have
the whole question dragging along for
months and months, with the business
of the country unsettled, is not to be
borne.
A deeper shade of concern is also ob
served in the faces of men Tike Senator
Hanna, who have been urging the
peace policy. These men are beginning
to suspect that the more time we give
to Spain the more difficult it will be to
dislodge her.
They are learning that the Govern
ment at Madrid is rapidly strengthen
ing its sea power. They are getting
information that in a short time she
expects to be so strong that she can
say when we want to back up our re
lief movement with force: "Do so if
you dare. We are ready. ' Word comes
to-night that with her new loan of
$40,000,000 she will soon have overcome
the advantage we now have over her
at sea. This change of sentiment is
having some effect on the administra
tion, and some of the members of the
Cabinet who h%\e been for peace are
shifting and beginning to contemplate
the prospect of war as not remote. Sec
retary of the Treasury Gage is not one
of these. He is still combating the
idea of war with might and main. It
has been learned that it was he who
brought up again at the last hour the
proposition to have financiers settle
the Cuban war with money, which
has been spurned by the Spanish Gov
ernment.

FURTHER DELAY
Senate Not to Act at Once
on the Maine
Report.
Findings Will Be Referred to
the Foreign Relations
Committee.
Administration Still Appealing to Con
gress to Prevent Bellicose
Speechmaking.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call >vice, Riggs House,
Washington, March 27.
The important event of the week in
the Senate will be the receipt of the
President's message transmitting the
report of the Maine Court of Inquiry,
which is expected early in the day on
Monday. The present understanding
is that the report will be referred to
the Committee on Foreign Relations,
and sent to the printer without being
re" '1. or more than incidentally re
ferred to, and that after this nothing
more will be said concerning it until
the committee shall have had a rea
sonable o^fcor' unity to consider it, or
until some further communication may
be received from the President on the
Cuban question.
There has been a general appeal
from the administration to the Senate
to avoid undue agitation on the Cuban
subject until the President may have
an opportunity to formulate the policy,
and the Senate appears quite disposed
to comply with the request. Still there
is no doubt that the Senate would grow
very restive under delay. Senator
Money expects to make a speech to
morrow on the lines of those of Sena
tor Proctor, Gallinger and Thurston,
based upon his observations in Cuba.
What further discussion there may
be on the Cuban situation will depend
so largely upon future developments
that it is useless to discuss the proba
bilities If the President should make
a recommendation or the Committee on
Foreign Relations a report the Senate
at once would be the center of an ani
mated discussion, the result of which
would be some radical declaration
against Spain. The problem is now to
hold the expression of opinion down to
the minimum pending the negotiations
of the President and the deliberations
of the committee.
REPORT TO BE READ
IN THE LOWER HOUSE
Will Then Be Referred to the Foreign
Relations Committee Without
Debate.
WASHINGTON, March 27.â The larg
est crowd which has attended a ses
sion of Congress in years is expected at
the Capitol to-morrow when the official
report of the Board of Inquiry on the
Maine disaster will be given to the
country. Extra instructions have been
issued to the attendants and admission
to the reserved galleries will be strictly
by card. Not one-tenth of the people
who storm the doors are expected to
g-ain admission. The members of the
House await the report with the same
feverish anxiety the public manifests,
and there are not likely to be a dozen
vacant seats on the floor. The scene
when the report is read will be intensely
dramatic, but those who go to the Cap
itol to-morrow expecting to see its pre
sentation followed by a wild furor of
oratory probably will be sorely disap
pointed. The report and accompanying
message will be brief and after being
read will be referred to the Committee
on Foreign Affairs without debate.
Mr. Hitt of Illinois, chairman of the
Foreign Affairs Committee, will be rec
â¢d by the Speaker to make this
motion. The motion is not debatable.
It is the wish of the President, as ex
pressed to the leaders of both parties,
that this course be followed and the
programme has been acquiesced in by
all parties> Should any single member
attempt to interfere with it a demand
for the previous question will take him
off his feet. Once in committee the find-
Ings of the board will remain there
until a report is made by the commit
tee, which would certainly not be until
Spain's explanation and position are
made known to the administration.
Meantime the precipitation of the
main issue between Spain and the
United States is likely to throw the
Maine disaster, with which the admin
istration means to deal as a separate
and distinct issue, into the background
as a subject for future settlement un
less Spain should 'take a position not
now anticipated \fhich would compel
immediate action. On Tuesday the
President will probably transmit a
message asking for an appropriation to
relieve the starvation in Cuba, The
appropriation will probably be voted
with almost as much unanimity as was
the â¦50,000,000 for the national defense,
but the debate may bring out some
criticism of the administration policy
by those wLo believe radical and ag
gressive intervention should be taken
at once. The administration is assured,
however, of a strong majority for the
policy it has so far mapped out to the
Republican an* Democratic leaders.
The members are so completely ab
sorbed by the questions of the hour
that during the remainder of the week
they are likely to inject debate upon
these questions into the proceedings at
every opportunity.;
But the rules as at present enforced
are rigorous and the outcrop of passion
and patriotism is likely to be confined
largely to the debate upon the naval
appropriation bill. Every effort will be
made to dispose of the bill as quickly
as possible in order to remove he op
portunity for Inflammatory speeches.
The Republican leaders believe they
are justified in exercising restraint un
til the time for actin arrive r.
After the Main<? report is read to
morrow the consideration of the naval
appropriation bill will be resumed, if
it is not deemed expedient in view of
the attending exeftement to allow the
District of Columbia Committee, whtch
is entitled to the day under the rules,
to go ahead. Tuesday and Fridn
private bill days and a contested elec
tion case could be thrown into the
House to consume the remainder of the
week. Under the rules any attempt to
discuss the Cuban question, except
during the consideration of the naval
bill, and then only by subterfuge, can
be prevented.
NAVAL CADETS MUST
UNDERGO EXAMINATION.
ANNAPOLIS, Md., March 27.â At the
dinner formation at the Naval Acad
emy to-day an order was read
directing the first class of cadets to re
port at the medical department to
morrow for physical examination pre
paratory, it is supposed, to sea
orders. It is rumored here that Cap
tain P. H. Cooper, superintendent of
the Academy, will be detached in a few
days and given some other command.
AGAINST PERPETUAL
INTERVENTION BY THE
AMERICAN GOVERNMENT
Newspapers of Madrid Cry Out Against
What They Term the Intolerable
Interference of the United
Slates.
MADRID, March 27.â A general in the army, who declines to per
mit the use of his name, said that it was incredible that the report
of the American court of inquiry into the Maine disaster should attrib
ute the destruction of the vessel to a submarine mine.
"Not even among savages," he asserted, "would such mines be
placed in their ports. Moreover, our own ships would have incurred
equal peril had the mines been placed in Havana harbor. Mines are
only laid in time of war, and then friendly nations are notified."
L,a Correspondencia de Espana says it understands the Government
is occupied with certain new factors in the situation which it believes
may give a more favorable turn to events.
El Correo says the Government is calm in the consciousness of
having done its duty, and is satisfied. The foreign press has recog
nized this, and also the firmness with which Spain is resolved to de
fend her national right and honor. El Correo adds: "God knows if
matters are becoming worse, which is possible, but the provocation is
notorious and scandalous, and if onerous conditions are proposed to us,
the country, en masse, faithful to its traditions, will repel them."
The Epoca says that Spain is trying to prevent war, considering it a
calamity, and has freely made important concessions, such as auton
omy, in order to avert it. Spain, the paper continues, has not lost for
.a single moment her calm consideration, but she cannot consent to
the perpetual intervention of Americans and the American Govern
ment.
El Heraldo declares that without the intervention of the United
States the Cuban insurrection would have been reduced to mere bri
gandage. "If the revolt continues," says El Heraldo, 'it is because
the rebels see in America hope of an ill-starred morrow for Spain,
and while this hope exists the insurrection will maintain sufficient
strength slowly to consume our blood and money. War with the
United States represents then the solution of the problem which we
must examine with tranquil minds."
I. a Nacional says it awaits calmly the approaching denouement.
CUTTERS FOR
NATAL SERVICE
Thirty-Eight Craft at the
Navy Department's
Disposal.
Valuable Auxiliary Force to
Be Utilized in Case
of "War.
The recent transfer of the vessels of
the Revenue Marine to the navy has
directed attention to this important
service The Revenue Marine was es
tablished upon the recommendation of
Alexander Hamilton, the first Secre- !
tary of the Treasury, and antedates the '.
regular navy by six years and seven i
months. It was organized with thirty j
commissioned officers March 21, 1.91, |
with ten vessels built or in course of
construction. On March 27, 1794, Wash
ington signed the bill authorizing the
construction of six frigates, the first of
whichâ the Constellationâ was launched ,
September 7 1797, and these dates fix
the beginning of the Revenue Marine
and the navy of the United States.
The statutes provide that in time of
war the vessels of the Revenue Marine
may be turned over to the Secretary of
the Navy, and in the wars and skir
mishes from 1798 to the rebellion of
IS6I-64 the revenue cutters and their
officers and crews have always ren
dered efficient service. Beginning in
1793 with the vessels commanded by ten
masters and other officers, maintained
at an annual expense of $18,500, this
sei vice has grown until at the present
time the fleet numbers thirty-eight ves
sels of all classes with 111 line officers,
10 cadets, 55 engineers and 863 enlisted
men. Of the vessels, thirty are propel
lers, two sidewheel steamers, four
steam launches and two are sail. Only
about one-half of the propellers are
available and serviceable, three being
stationed on the lakes. Of the twenty
screw steamers enumerated in the ap
pended table one-half have a speed of
only ten knots, and only those built of
late have sea speeds of twelve to fifteen
knots. Only those available for naval
service are enumerated in the following
table:

Total, IB vessels

The locations of these cutters are:
Commodore Perry, Richard Rush,
Thomas Corwin, U. S. Grant, Bear and
Golden Gate on the Pacific Coast, and
the Hugh McCullough is on its way
out here, makinrr a voyage of 25,000
miles, via the Suez Canal. The other
cutters are on the Atlantic Coast.
Of all these vessels, more or less suit
able for naval purposes, the Hugh Me-
Cullough is almost equal to any of the
gunboats recently built. She is a com
posite vessel, steel frame and wood
bottom, and was launched from
Cramp's yard December 19, 1896. The
displacement is 12S0 tons, her length
219 feet, breadth 34 feet, draught 14
feet. The engines are of 2000 horse
power, and developed a speed of 17
knots at the t-ial. Her armament con
sists of four 6-pounder Hotchkiss, four
1-pounders and a bow torpedo tube.
Next in efficiency come the Daniel
Manning:. Wlnona, Galveston, Hud
son, Lot M. Morrill and the rest tabu
lated. The Walter Q. Gresham of 777
tons, built in 1896, is also a very fast
and efficient cutter, but not likely to
be taken from her station. The offi
cers of the Revenue Marine number 36
captains, one-half of whom hay..- pass
ed the age where active duty should
cease; 36 first lieutenants, 33 second
lieutenants, one-third of whom are
practically retired; 6 third lieutenants
and 10 cadets. The engineer officers
include 25 chief engineers, 21 first as
sistant engineers and 9 second assis
tants. The present armament, cinsist
ing mainly of Hotchkiss and smaller
machine guns, could no doubt be in
creased on some of the cutters to 4
inch quick-firing guns, as all the ves
sels are built sufficiently strong to
carry gunboat armaments.
The other branch of the Government
property on water convertible into aux
iliary naval vessels ie the fleet of the
Lighthouse Establishment, which com
prises 39 vessels of all classes. Many
of these would be useless for war pur
poses, and the following list includes
only such as may be considered avail*
able: Armeria, 1052 tons: Azalea, 4?9
tons; Laurel, 320 tons: Madrono, 412
tons; Manzanita, 450 tons: Mangrove,
393 tons, and Wisteria and Zizania,
each of 450 tons. These Iron or steel
propellers range in speed from 14 to 11
knots; they are by virtue of the ser
vice required very strongly built, and
could be fitted with a four or five inch
pivot forward without much trouble,
their general build and arrangemont
favoring such an armament. Thus the
Revenue Marine and Lighthouse Es
tablishment may furnish 29 vessels to
the naval defense, the only difficulty
in the way being a lack of guns other
than Hotchkiss.

CONFER ON
THE CRISIS
Report of the Maine Court
and Cuba Are Under
Consideration.
Many Are Beginning to Believe
That Spain Will Accept the
Demand of Uncle Sam to
End the Island War.
Call Office, Rlggs House,
"Washington, March 27.
The President saw a number of the i
members of the Cabinet at the White
House to-day. They dropped in one by
one until those present included Secre
taries Bliss, Alger, Gage and Attorney
. General Griggs. With them also was
Assistant Secretary Day of the State
Department, who presumably had
some dispatches to show the President.
The gathering was not a special Cabi
net meeting in the sense that that
term is generally used, but was simply
a talk between the President and his
advisers concerning matters on which
he desired to consult. The Cuban ques
tion and the report of the Maine court
of inquiry were the topics discussed,
but so far as could be ascertained noth
ing conclusive was determined, one of
the members of the Cabinet saying
subsequently that there was nothing
new or startling in the situation.
The presence of Judge Day would
infer that there were advices from
Minister Woodford, but further than
an acknowledgment that communica
tion is in progress between the State
Department and the Minister nothing
could be ascertained.
At the State, War and Navy depart
ments there was little semblance of
Sabbath. Chiefs of bureaus, clerks,
ms3sencers and telegraph operators
-..ero at work. Probably never since
tÂ£a days of the late war have so many
officials gathered at the War and
Navy departments on a Sunday. Dis
patches that came over night regard
ing the movements of ships and other
matters were received, and, as many
of them required a prompt answer by
. the department, emergency replies
were formulated.
Secretary Long, however, did not ap
pear at the Navy Department during
the day, as most of the matters re
quiring attention were those that
could as well be attended to by bureau
officers and their assistants. Mrs.
Long has been ill for some time, and
the Secretary in part shook official
cares and spent the major portion of
the day with her. In the afternoon, in
company with Mrs. Long, the Secre
tary drove to the navy yard and in
spected the dynamite cruiser Vesuvius,
â vjhich is having her guns repaired. The
v'ssel has been at the yard since about
a week, and great crowds have been
there to see her.
Assistant Secretary Day spent a por
â  tion of the Sabbath at the State De
partment and there received a call
from the Span'sh Minister, a rather
unusual procedure, indicating impor
tant matters for consideration. The
conference lasted some time, but its
nature could not be learned.
To-night Commodore Winfield S.
Schley, just appointed to the command
of the "flying squadron," left here for
Norfolk. It is said that to-morrow he
will hoist his flag on the Brooklyn,
' -which is to be the flagship of the fleet.
The only other vessel of the squadron
now at Hampton Roads is the Massa
chusetts. Of the remaining three the
Texas is in New York receiving her
ammunition hoists and the Columbia
and the Minneapolis are at League Is
land navy yard, where the final work
preparatory to their sea service is be
ing hurriedly done. The latter will be
at Norfolk about the middle of the
week.
Thj developments of the day in the
Cuban situation indicate steady pro
gress in the negotiations in this coun
try and â  Spain, looking to the main
tenance of peac at the present at
least. There is good authority for say
ing that Spain's wish is to secure a ces
sation of hostilities in Cuba rather than
to engage in a war with the United
States, and that it is more than proo
able that negotiation between the Gov
ernment of the United Stater and the
Sagasta Ministry will take a turn in
the immediate future. The present
Spanish Ministry has expressed a pa
cific disposition from the beginning,
"1 and the indications are strong now that
it will avail itself of the good offices
of the United St. tes to the fullest ex
tent that public opinion in Spain will
allow in bringing to an end the hos
tilities in Cub;.,
To what extent the Unted States may
â¢ go in assisting Spain in her present de
sign of securin I an armistice is not yet
determined, but the conservative ele
ment in the administration consider the
â¢ manifestation of this desire on their
. part for even a temporary peace a di
rect result of President McKinley's
diplomacy and they are naturally dis
posed to contend that the President
should be left free for the present at
least to pursue a policy which promises
much in the way of preventing war be
tween this country and Spain and also
of bringing to a close the hostilities in
Cuba. Hence there will be an effort
on the part of the peacefully inclined in
Congress to continue to hold that body
In check and to prevent inflammatory
utterances there until this promising
diplomatic lead may be exploited. On
the part of the administration it is ;
stated that the development of the situ
ation will not require a great length of |
time ana that there will be no ex
" tended delay.
A policy has been fully determined |
upon by the President. It is to bring
the Cuban war to a close. This will be |
accomplished by pointed intervention if j
necessary, but "it is considered far pre
ferable that the end should come as the
result of peaceful negotiations than
that it shou '<i be accompanied by hos
tile demonstrations on the part of the
United States. Hence the disposition of;
the President Is to give Spain a fair op
iPortunity to secure an armistice with
V.? C " bans and to allow her a reason- i
able time in which to come to an un
derstanding with the Cubans. '
â¦v, \Â°*u stated upon -high authority
that there has been no abatement of
the. President's intention to see that
the war is terminated and that it is
closed upon terms that will render the
Cubans practically a free people. : It is
not believed that they would accept
1 iney Â«ouia accept
anything less nor that Americans
would be satisfied if we should encour
age a settlement that would not be ac
ceptable to the Cubans. If there should
now be an armistice it would be with
the concessions made by Spain at the
instance of this country, that negotia
tions should be opened immediately
with the insurgents looking to the es
tablishment of a permanent peace upon
these terms. It has long been the hope
of the Administration to bring Spam to
the point of making propositions of this
character as the basis of a settlement
that is satisfactory to all parties, and
it is hoped from Spain's attitude that
this time has arrived.
The friends of the Administration
feel that the situation is a very delicate
one and that much will depend upon
the course Congress may pursue. In
the meantime the President will, on
Wednesday, send his message asking
that an appropriation be made for the
aid of the destitute Cubans.
CONGRESS WEARY OF
CONTINUED DELAY
Will Take Affairs Into Its Own
Hands If the Administration
Does Not Act Soon.
NEW YORK, March 27.â The Her
ald's Washington correspondent tele- i
graphs: Many members with whom I
talked to-day express themselves as ,
very impatient of further delay in the ;
enunciation of a decisive policy look- j
ing to the speedy ending of the war |
in Cuba. They say that if the admin
istration is disposed to negotiate for
settling the Cuban difficulty diplo- I
matically with Spain much longer Con
gresa will take the matter into its own
hands and precipitate decisive action, i
Senator Lindsay of Kentucky, dis- i
cussing the general situation, said to
me to-day:
"If the President does not transmit
to Congress to-morrow the entire re- j
port of the Maine court of inquiry, the !
absolute confidence and support which j
the members of both houses, regardless
of party, have accorded him will be
very materially lessened. The adminis
tration has stated that it is making
every preparation for a war with Spain
growing out of a long chain of events,
of which the destruction of the Maine
may have been the most important. If
we are on the brink of war, Congress, j
which is the sole war-making power, '
ought to be put into possession of every j
line of testimony adduced, at the ses- I
sions of the court of inquiry.
"If the testimony goes to the Com- I
mittee on Foreign Relations, Congress
will not be satisfied, and the policy
which the President may have formu
lated will be disregarded. Unless Con- |
gress is assured that the administra- !
tion is not temporizing it cannot be re
strained from taking decisive action on
its own account. Furthermore, Con- j
gress will not endure continued diplo
matic negotiations with Spain regard
ing the settlement of the Cuban ques
tion. If we are to continue to parley i
with the Madrid Government the ad- I
ministration will find that the patience j
of Congress is exhausted; even the (
most conservative men will be con- ;
strained to repudiate this waiting and !
indecisive policy and to act. We do not !
want war, but we must insist that Cuba j
shall be immediately freed forever ;
from Spanish Government and barba- j
rity. If Spain will not peaceably re- j
llnquish the island she must be forced |
to do so. This is the temper of Con
gress, and Congress will shape the pol
icy of the country."
I had a talk with a very conserva
tive member of the House Committee
on Foreign Affairs, who, en account of
his connection with that committee,
could not talk for publication. This
gentleman, who has on former occa- j
sions opposed any action in regard to j
Cuban affairs, said to me:
"There is grave danger of Congress
taking the whole matter from the
hands of the. President if he tries to
hold back too long. Aside from re
stricted localities, the people of the
country are a unit in favor of aggres
sive action, and the men in the House
who expect to stand for re-election, and
who are getting letters from their dis
tricts, come to me every day and de
clare they cannot face their constitu
ents if they fail to take early action
toward ending the horrible condition of
affairs which prevails in Cuba, and
which Spain has given ample evidence
she has neither the desire nor the
power to end. Unless there is some
vital military or naval reason for the
delay, the President should not hesi
tate a day longer, but should take ac
tion at once to terminate Spanish mis
rule in Cuba."
GARIBALDI IS READY
TO FIGHT FOR CUBA.
"Would Send an Army of Forty Thou
sand Men if Their Expenses
Were Paid.
BERLIN, March 27.â The Rome cor
respondent of the Berliner Tageblatt
telegraphs:
"The Marquis Visconti Venosta, the
Italian Foreign Minister, says the Cu
ban situation has grown worse, but
that outside of Austria, which morally
supports Spain for dynastic reasons, no
European power is inclined to show

TALKS WAR
Declares That the Time
for Action Has
Arrived.
This Veteran Knows Only Too
Well of the Treachery
of Spaniards.
Has Never HÂ«d a Doubt That the
Maine Was Blown Up by En
emies of Uncle Sam.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON, March 27.â General N. A.
M. Dudley, retired, gave the following
statement to The Call correspondent to
night:
"It is my opinion only one construc
tion could be put upon the sending of
the fleet of torpedo ships to Havana
harborâ an act of war, which It would
become the duty of the United States
Government to resent. The situation
is indeed one of imminent war, and as
much as I deplore the fact, I cannot
doubt from the bellicose attitude of the
Spanish Government that she has been
expecting a conflict and as well as she
could has prepared herself for it
"No other conclusion could be arrived
at from a review of the circumstances
of the last three months than that
Spain was regarding war with this
country as inevitable. And it is equally
true that the administration looks at
the matter in the same light. I hate
the thought of war. 1 have been in the
army a King time, have been under a
hundred days' fire and seen service in
Mexico and the West, and have in my
memory a recollection of hundreds of
brave men dead and dying from the
ravages of battle, and I don't want
war. It is a horrible thing but I feel,
nevertheless, that the Government has
shown a noble spirit of forbearance,
and the time for forbearance has
passed. I know what the Spaniards
are. The whole history of Spain is a
story of atrocities, of unspeakable
crimes, and the Spanish are the most
treacherous of all races of the earth.
And it is because I know Spanish
character that I believe and have be
lieved from the first that the Maine
in Havana harbor was deliberately
blown up. I can't express with too
much emphrsis my admiration for the
attitude the administration has taken
during the whole course of this
trouble. The whole disturbance is a
credit to the country. It is standing
upon the same ground which it stood
during the Civil War â the cause of
simple humanity, and if the nation
for whose starving people thousands of
dollars and shiploads of rations have
been sent to Cuba wants war this coun
try has nothing to fear and will take
part in any c nflict with credit to it
self and honor to the administration."
WOULD NOT SHIP

Cotton Expoi-ters at Galveston Fear
That Their Cargoes Might
Bs Seized.
NEW YORK, March 27.â An Austin
special to the Herald says: Cotton
buyers and brokers of this State are
becoming alarmed at the situation in
business brought on by war rumors.
They find it impossible to secure In
surance. People will not accept cotton
with the present cloud hovering over
the country.
A Spanish ship now in Galveston, in
attempting to load cottc-n for Liver
pool, has been refused insurance for
fear of seizure on the high seas. Sev
eral foreign firms have wired to their
State buyers to ship on British vessels
only, as they are considered the only
safe means of transportation in case of
war. There is at least a third of the
Texas cotton crop yet to be moved, and
the present war scare is being seriously
felt in the marketing of the product.
Efforts are being made looking to re
lieving the situation, but at present
local buyers say the situation is very
critical.

KEY WEST, Fla., March 27.â The ex

everywhere groups could be seen dis
cussing the probability of war with
Spain. The work of painting the bat
tleships, unexpectedly stopped yester
day, will be resumed to-morrow. They
will be painted a dull lead color in

It is learned that Captain Wick of

Bpecial Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, March 27. â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Four of
the speediest and most desirable ves
sels of the lighthouse service have been
selected for conversion into auxiliary
men of war. By direction of the Presi
dent the Treasury Department formally
turned over the Ameria, Maple and
Mangrove to the Secretary of the Navy
yesterday, and that official at once is
sued orders to their commanding offi
cers, directing them to proceed imme
diately to Norfolk navy yard. There
the vessels will be inspected by a board
of officers to be appointed by Commo
dore Farquhar, commandant of the
yard, for the purpose of determining
the armament and protection that they
should receive. As these orders were
telegraphed, it is expected that the ves
sels are now making preparations to
start for Norfolk. The Ameria is in
New York harbor, the Maple is
serving in Maryland waters and the
Mangrove is now in Havana in attend
ance upon the divers who are working
on the remains of the Maine. It is ex
pected that the Ameria will make quite
a formidable gunboat when she re
ceives her protection and armament.
She has a gross tonnage of 1100, a
draught of 16 feet and horsepower of
1000, which will drive her at the rate
of about IT> knots an hour. It is ex
pected that the Ameria will be given a
battery of four or five inch guns be
sides a number of smaller weapons, and
she will be attached to the fleet at Key
West for duty as a picket boat.
The Maple has a gross tonnage of 400
tons and will be remembered as the
vessel used by ex-President Cleveland
during his fishing expeditions in the
Virginia swamps. The Mangrove will
leave Havana probably as soon as pc-s
sibel for Norfolk, her place being taken
by the coast survey steamer Bache.
which arrived at that port last night
from Key West.
The board which will be appointed to
determine the armament and protection
to be given the lighthouse service ves
sels will perform a similar duty in con
nection with revenue cutters. Some <rf
the cutters are expected to arrive at
Norfolk during the present week. The
Gresham and Calumet are on the lakes
and they will begin their voyage tn
Norfolk through the lakes, the Welland
canal and St. Lawrence as soon as they
can be made ready for the trip. In order
to permit the Gresham to get through
Welland canal it will be necessary for
twenty feet of her stern to be removed.
It will also be necessary to remove the
same amount from the Onondaga and
Algonquin, which are being rushed tci
completion at Cleveland. To pay the
expense of this work and to take the
revenue cutters to Norfolk from their
present stations the President has al
lc-wed $75.000^
SAYS INTERVENTION
WOULD BE JUSTIFIED.
General Manderson Believes This
Government Should Inter
fere in Cuba.
OMAHA. March 27.â General Charles
F. Manderson in an interview on the
Cuban situation says:
"It surely looks more like war than
it did two weeks ago. To my mind
the action of Spain in sendinga formid
; able flotilla of torpedo boats to Cuba
forms an incident that is more war
; like than any of the features of the
| Maine disaster or of the complications
! growing out of the oppression and
1 starvation of the Cubans.
"The question of indemnity to this
! Government for the loss of the Maine
1 might be settled by a Court of Nations
'or any other form of arbitration. On
, the other hand it seems to me that this

I ranted In taking steps toward inter-
I vention in the Spanish -C. ;>an difficul

ST. LOUIS, March 27.â John A. Mc-
Call, president of the New York Life

to the probability that insurance rates
would be increased by war, said: "We
will not only maintain our present

WITH ENGLAND
Views of Professor Wells
of Dartmouth Col

Believes There Should Be an
Alliance of English-Speak
ing Nations.
American TrÂ«da Threatened by
the Powers of Continental
Europe.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON, March 27.â Professor D.
Collins Wells of Dartmouth College, a
well-known authority on international
law, to-day gave The Call correspond
ent a statement on the proposed Eng
lish alliance in view of the present
Spanish and Chinese troubles. He said:
"I believe that inasmuch as the colo
nization of different parts of the world
by France, Germany and Russia has
gradually shut out the United States
commerce byd -riminating tariffs in fa
vor of the mother country, an extension
of such a policy is ultimately going to
prove disastrous to the United States.
Both England and the United States
are virtually shut out from trade with
French, German or Russian colonies.
Is it not time that these two great Elng
lish-speaking nations should combine
for mutual protection from future en
croachment upon their commerce by
nations of Europe and for benefits of
mutually increased commercial advan
tages? The present Cuban crisis has
revealed a fundamental sympathy be
tween all English-speaking people. Un
i der certain circumstances there is
growing up in tht? Teat American re
public a dangerous antagonist for
1 Great Britain and a valuable ally for
the European continent, whose policy
should be to treat her with the greatest
consideration.
"It is time we realized that there is
practically a continental alliance with
the end in view to divide up England's
provinces. This anti-English or anti
liberal feeling seems the ruling passion
in the breast of Kaiser William. He
would not lose sight of German bond
holders and traders in these events.
"Now all this concerns us. If they are
allowed to partition China we must re
i tire from that market. In the present
crisis continental nations give at least
moral support to Spain.
"I know of no valid reason why Eng-
I land and the United States, having re
â  ciprocal interests and common lan
' guage, traditions and institutions,
should not have for one another such
! natural sympathy as to forever pre
' vent hostilities between them. There
would be vast strength in such an al
\ liance."

HAVANA, March 27.â As a result of
the arrival to-day of Captain Chad
wick of the flagship New York to con
voke a sub-committee of investigation,
consisting of himself. Captain Cowles
of the Fern and Lieutenant-Comman
der Watowrlght of the Maine, the
work of dismantling the wreck of the
Maine may be abandoned. It is for
this committee to decide whether that
work shall continue at this time and
under the present circumstances. An
informal meeting was held this morn
ing, at which an inventory of the
movable furniture still aboard the
Maine was gone over and an estimate
marie of the time that would be re
quired to remove it. To-morrow the
matter will be gone over in a much
more thorough manner, and a decision
may be arrived at to-morrow night,
though it is quite likely that the Bache
will not take Captain Chadwick back
to Key "West before Tuesday.
It is said to be quite likely that
wrecking operations will be dropped
upon order of this committee. The
Mangrove has taken on the six-inch
guns and explosive materials already
brought up from the Maine and w r ill
sail for Key West as soon as Captain
Chadwick makes known the decision
of the committee.

DETERMINE
TO ABANDON
THE MAINE
The Naval Officers Realize
That the Battle=Ship
Is Lost.
After All the Property Possible
Is Saved by Wreckers the
Hull Will Be Destroyed
as an Obstruction.
NEW YORK, March 27.â A Wash
ington special to the Herald says: In
view of the refusal of the Spanish Gov
ernment to permit the use of dynamite
in wrecking work on the Maine con
siderable difficulty is anticipated by the
authorities in raising the turreted guns
of the battle-ship.
There has never been any Intention
on the part of this Government to al
low the use of explosives in such large
quantities as to destroy the evidences
of an external explosion, which have
been reported by the Court of Inquiry.
Appreciating that the Spanish courts
will seek to have the matter referred to
international arbitration it is desired
by the officials to leave the Maine in
the same condition as when she went
down. The authorities say, therefore,
that it is as much to the interest of this
Government as to Spain not to permit
the use of dynamite in sufficient quan
tities to destroy the evidences of exter
nal explosion.
Captain Sigsbee's letter to Secretary
Long recommending the use of dyna
mite in small quantities for the pur
pose of lifting the caps of the 10-inch
turrets was written because of the diffi
culties in wrecking work which dyna
mite would overcome. The caps are
riveted to vertical plates and it is prac
tically impossible for a diver working
under water to exert enough force to
break the rivets so as to permit the lift
ing of the caps by the derrick chief.
With dynamite it would have been
comparatively an easy matter to raise
the caps of turrets and to remove the
10-inch guns. There are four of these
weapons valued at about $250,000, and it
is desired by this Government to get
them as quickly as possible. Although

It is generally understood that the
Maine will be abandoned as soon as the
wreckers have completed their work,
unless the Spanish and American gov
ernments should agree to an interna

will be retained as the property of the
Government until the investigation is

BKAGUAY, March 23 (via Seattle,
March 27).â For a week past the excite
ment here as to the rumored rich strikes
near the Big Salmon Paver has been
growing and growing, and one after
another a dozen or so of the leading
men of the town have packed their out
fits and started up the trail in a rush.
From Dyea also there has been an
exodus, and the Chilkoot summit has
for the last three or four days been so
jammed with men that night and day
there was a continual procession, the
chin of one man grazing the pack* of
the man in front of him. It is said that
on the other side from Lake Bennett
and all the camps along the lakes
where so many hundreds have been
camped during the winter there has
been a regular stampede, and the trail
for two hundred miles is thick with
people.
A man arrived at Dyea on Monday
who showed a lot of nuggets from the
new diggings, and Charles Kilpatrick
of Philadelphia is in town here showing
shot gold that, he has taken from his
claim on the creek where the new
strike was made. The new diggings
are on Phil Walsh Creek, which emp
ties into the Lewis four miles below
the Big Salmon. The first discovery
was made in January by a party of ten
spending the winter there, of whom
C. M. Breede and a man named Tim
ons put in the discovery post two and
a half miles from the mouth of the
creek. Mr. Kilpatrick was there on
March 6. and staked claim Xo. 60
above Discovery. When he left the
creek, which is about eighteen miles
long. No. 17f> above and Xo. 40 below
Discovery had been staked. He says
by this "time at least 1500 people are
there, or more than enough to stake
the creeK in claims of 250 feet several
times over.
He heard that rich strikes had been
made on Lake or Cedar Creek, ten
miles below, hut on the opposite or
west side of the Lewis River, by Con
nelly of the same party which made
the discovery on Phil Walsh Creek.
Mr. Kilpatrick declares that the aver
age at a depth of four feet was $2 50
a pan. Bedmck is about eight feot, and
had not been reached When he left.
Every one who has comÂ° out these last
few days declares the district to be
richer than anything in the Klondike.
KLONDIKER HAMLIN
SUCCUMBS TO EXPOSURE.
Former Dominion Engineer Fatally
Frost Bitten While Lost
in a Storm.
VICTORIA, B. C. March 27.â News
was brought from Dawson City to
day by John Piche, who left the Klon
dike capital on February 16, that L. B.
Hamlin, a well-known Canadian engi
neer, died In a hospital on the morn
ing'of that day. He was badly frozen
a month ago and lingered In the hospi
tal since then, suffering until death
came.
Hamlin left Victoria last summer to
Burvey Hootalinqua river and Teslin
lake for the Provincial Government,
which wished to ascertain if a steam
ship could run from Teslin to Daw-
Bon. After submitting his report he
proceeded to Dawson to try his for
tune as a miner. While at Dawson in
January, r.ews came of rich strikes on
Reindeer Creek, and with another man.
whose name was not given, he joined
the stampede. He and his companion
were fortunate enough to find good
claims on the new creek, which is a
tributary to Dominion Creek, and we*e
on the way back to Dawson to record
them when they lost their way.
The weather was terribly cold, and at
nightfall a heavy wind intensified it.
Hamlin and his companion, realizing
they must find shelter if they would
save their lives, hunted in all direc
tions, but It was not until early morn
ing that they found shelter from the
storm in a small cabin on the sum
mit of the divide. The miners living
there cared for them as well as they
could, but the effects of the severe ex
posure had been too much for Hamlin
and his companion, who were in urgent
need of medical assistance. Realizing
this, the miners made a Irip to Dawson
and informed the mounted police, who
sent a dog team for Hamlin. The jour
ney took several days and when the
Dawson hospital was reached Hamlin
was very low. After suffering great
pain for a week he died. His conirian
lon, although surviving the terrible
night's exposure, suffered severely and
both his feet will have to be axnpu
tated.
Hamlin, who was GO years old. was at
one time very wealthy, having realized
considerable money from his connec
tion with the construction of the Cana
dian Pacific Railroad and other rail
way enterprises. He lost his fortune
through the collapse of the real estate
boom.
GOVERNOR BRADY GOES
OVER THE DYEA TRAIL
Travels to the Summit to Note the
Presence of the British
Flag.
SKAGUAY. March 20, via Seattle.
Wash., March 27.â Governor Brady and
Collector Ivey yesterday went over the
Dyea ' trail to the summit to of
ficially note the British flag fly
ing there. Collector Ivey came al
most direct from Washington, with in
structions to post two American sub
collectors at Lake Bennett, so that peo
ple going through the ; United States'
narrow strip of territory, now very
much narrower, could v deposit the
amount of their duty here and T collect
the same amount at the boundary, and
thus save the expense of convoys at
$6 a day.
The late newspapers reported that
the summit had been conceded to Can
ada, but the collector did not know this
officially, and so he and the Governor
went on horseback to Sheep Camp, and
from there climbed up the summit to
interview Captain Belcher, in com
mand of the mounted police there. The
captain received them courteously, but
in reply to Mr. Tvey's "question as to
whether he could place sub-collectors
at Lake Bennett. Captain Belcher said
he certainly could not with his (Bel
cher's) permission. The conversation
that ensued was similar to the one had
with Captain Belcher by The Call cor
respondent, the courteous mounted po
lice officer making no disguisement of
the fact that Canada claimed the ter
ritory beyond.
Governor Brady and Mr. Ivey asked
politely Li what authority Captain
Belcher hiVd taken up his position
there, and the answer was. "By in
structions from his superiors." The
collector has nothing further to do
but to report the matter to Washing
ton and ask if the sub-collectors be
placed on the summit.
So far as the rumored drastic in
structions from the Treasury Depart
ment to entirely stop the liquor traffic
in Alaska are concerned. Collector Ivey
had done nothing except close the
breweries. All the saloons are running
as usual. Governor Brady, however,
who leaves for Washington at once in
order to have his say in the impend
ing Alaska legislation, is outspoken as
to the iniquity and illegality of the
saloon business, and he seems to favor
the idea of asking Congress to grant
Alaska statehood, instancing Califor
nia, as an example of becoming a State
without first being a Territory, under
similar conditions to those now exist
ing in Alaska.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 28, 1898.
STAMPEDE TO
NEW DIGGINGS
Rush From Dawson to the
Scene of a Rich
Strike.
Pay Dirt Found Between the
Big and Little Skookum
Creeks.
Charles McCarthy of San Francisco
Shot in a Brawl at
Skaguay.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SKAGUAY, Alaska, March 24, via
Seattle, Wash., March 27.â One of the
biggest stampedes yet recorded in the
Klondike region was occasioned on
February 12 by a very rich strike on
the divide between the Big and Little
Skookum. The strike was made in
bench diggings on a high hog-back, 300
or 400 feet above the level of the
gulches. Pay dirt running from $15 to
535 to the pan was found.
Following the announcement of the
strike occurred a stampede from Daw
son of immense proportions, and the
entire ridge was staked out in an in
credibly short time.
This news was brought to this city
this week by A. Piche, official courier
and dispatch bearer for the Canadian
Government. Mr. Piche says there was
immense excitement at Dawson when
he left over the Skookum strike, and
that over 200 men were standing in line
at the Recorder's office to make a rec
ord of their claims. Mr. Piche brings
the news of a new strike on Lewis
River, which is of great importance if
It develops as now promised.
On March 6 a man named Con
nolly, while prospecting a small "pup"
leading off the leads about seven ty
miles below Lake Le Barge, found pay
dirt, which is big in promise. Piche
personally visited the claim and took
from 52 to $3 from a single pan. The
discovery is about three miles up the
stream from the leads.
The latest reports from the Salmon
River country were brought out by
Charles Fitzpatrick, who arrived here
from that district. Fitzpatrick says
the find on Walsh Creek is all that has
been claimed for it, as he took from his
own claim $2 50 to the pan. He says
there are already about 1000 people at
Walsh Creek, which is 500 more than
can obtain claims on that particular
stream. The creek is not fifty miles
in length, as was at first reported. It
will not measure over twenty-five miles
in length. He says, however, that the
whole country in that vicinity is min
eral bearing, and that in his judgment
the next three months will see some
further remarkable strikes. He says:
"For instance, I think the Sc-uth
Fork of the Big Salmon will turn out
a paying investment. It is about 125
miles from Lewis River. Then there is
the Loto or Lote Creek, which has al
ready shown up favorably, running
about 75 cents to the pan, and I could
mention fc-ur or five other creeks in the
vicinity equally as good."
What is regarded by many as an im
portant and rich gold strike has been
made in the immediate vicinity of
Skaguay. For some time past system
atic prospecting has been carried on in
the hills surrounding the Skaguay trail,
and at List it has been rewarded.
Thomas H. Phipps and Ralph Smith
claim to have unearthed a ledge of rich
quartz bearing free milling gold. The
location is kept a secret, but is de
scribed by them as being "within an
hour's walk of the post office."
The value of the find cannot be deter
mined until returns from the assay
office at Juneau are made.
The prospect bears every evidence of
being more than a surface cronping.
Samples picked at random were beaten
up with a hammer and particles of yel
low metal washed from the dust excited
much interest. The locators claim to
have abundant capital to develop the
mine and say a bucket tramway will
readily solve the prc-blem of getting out
the quartz.
Charles McCarthy, a well-known
ward politician of San Francisco, was
shot through the legs in this city this
morning by Charley Ritter, a waiter in
the Horseshoe restaurant. The row
grew out of a drunken brawl. McCar
thy's wound is serious, though not dan
gerous. At about the same hour an
c-ther shooting affray occurred on Mc-
Kinney street, in which several shots
were fired. No visible results were left
save a bullet hole through the sign of
a newspaper office.
RELIEF FUND FOR

Twenty-Five of the Crew Reported
Dead and as Many Mora
Missing.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ST. JOHNS. N. F.. March 27. -The j
scaling steamer Greenland, which put i
Into Bay de Verds last night with a story i
of terrible disaster to her crew on !
Wednesday and Thursday while among
the tee floes in search of seals, arrived i
here this afternoon. She reported twenty- !
five dead, twenty-five missing and sixty
six so fearfully frostbitten that about
twenty of them will lose their limbs.
Already a relief fund has been started
to assist the injured and the relatives of
the deceased.
The Greenland drove ashore In Bay
de Verds last night during a heavy gale, ]
her anchor chains parting, but she got :
off again without serious damage. She j
had a narrow escape while making St. I
Johns harbor, owing to the imperfect
compass and a thick fog. A man who was
watching her from the rigging of a vessei
near by fell to the deck, and has since
died from his injuries.
The Greenland has 14.000 seals. She re
ports that the Aurora has 18.000, the
Diana 12,000 and the^ Iceland 10,000.

GENERAL LEE IS
PREPARING FOR TROUBLE.
As Consul He Is Taking Steps to
Communicate With Americans
If a Crisis Comes.
HAVANA (via the Herald-Call dis
patch boat to Key West, Fla., March
27.â The Spanish guard boat containing
a naval officer and sailors has again
been placed on duty day and night, pa
trolling the waters immediately sur
rounding the wreck of the Maine. Their
purpose is said to be to see that Gen
eral Blanco's orders prohibiting the
use of dynamite in removing portions
of the wreck is not violated.
For many days immediately after the
explosion Spanish patrol boats guarded
the wreck continually, but their serv
ices were discontinued after the arrival
of the barge Chief and other large
wrecking apparatus from the north.
The sudden presumption of what ap
pears like official espionage, therefore,
has caused some comment.
Since Captain Sigsbee requested and
General Blanco refused permission to
use dynamite, nobody for a moment
has contemplated its use in violation
of the Captain General's orders. The
Spanish authorities cannot suppose
any such violation has been contem
plated.
The spirit of resistance to a point of
war has grown rapidly here within
forty-eight hours. Local newspapers
are catering to it daily. The position j
of Americans in Havana is undoubtedly
more delicate to-day than ever before, j
This act, therefore, together with the j
Government's order directing local al- I
caldes to refuse all information to rep- i
resentatives of the American relief
committee, is regarded as only an
other evidence of the growing ani
mosity against the so-called American
impudence.
Secretary-General Congusto yester- ]
day asked Consul-General Lee to per
mit him to furnish personal body j
guards. General Lee declined this of- {
fer, and Congosto contented himself
with increasing the detail of plain
clothes detectives which for weeks have
kept a careful eye on General Lee at
all times, with a view to his protection
as he goes about the city.
Consul-General Lee. believing that a j
serious crisis of affairs is likely to oc
cur now at any moment, is to-day pre
paring a revised list of all Americans
now in Havana, together with their
addresses, so that in case of emergency j
they may be communicated with at
short notice.
ENORMOUS MAJORITY
FOR SENOR SAGASTA
Elections for the Popular Branch of
the Spanish Cortes Pass Off
Quietly.
MADRID, March 27.â The elections
for the popular branch of the Cortes
have passed off rather quietly. The in
dications are that Senor Sagasta will
have an enormous majority, estimated
at 300 of the 432 seats in the Congress.
Disorders are apprehended at Bil
bao, where the polling caused great ex
citement. The military judge at Bilbao
issued a warrant for the arrest of three
Socialist Municipal Councilors. One of
them was taken into custody, but the
other two escaped.
MIDNIGHT â The election In the
capital was without special incident.
The elected Deputies include five Lib
erals, one Independent and two Con
servatives. *â 
Despite great precautions at Bilbao
there was much disorder. A body of
a hundred miners tried to commit acts
of violence. It is rumored that a So
cialist has beaten a Conservative can
didate there. All the other provinces
are reported calm.
M. Patenotre. the French Embassa
dor, had a conference with Senor Gul
lon yesterday, to which much impor
tance is attached.
HAVANA, March 27.â The election of
Deputies to the Cortes has been in
progress to-day. The Orden Publico
Guards, armed with rifles, have stood
ready to prevent any disorders and the
polling up to the time this dispatch was
filed (before noon) was peaceful. The
city generally is quiet. Last night the
theaters were full and to-day the
streets are thronged.

SENSATIONAL EPISODE
AT FORTRESS MONROE.
Report That a Sergeant Has Disap-
peared With the Plans of the
Fortifications.
NEWPORT NEWS, Va.. March 27.â
The disappearance of a German ser
geant named Tscherning from Fortress
Monroe caused the report to be circu
lated to-day that plans of the forti
fications had been stolen. The com
mandant at the fort attributes Tscher
ning's absence to a spree, and says no
plans are missing. Other officers say
that Tscherning could have drawn
plans of his own if he had been so dis
posed, as he is a skilled engineer.
In the Handball Arena.
The coming of the two champions of
handball sports has started among the
local players a sort of impetus to emulate
as far as it is possible the example set by
those two great players. As a conse
quence, the attendance at Phil Ryan's
San Francisco court yesterday afternoon
was better than on any other Sunday,
except, of course, when the crack players
were billed for a day's sport.
The farewell game of Phil Casey was
played yesterday afternoon, at which
that distinguished world's champion and
J. C. Nealon entered the arena against
James Dunne and T. F. Bonnett. Both
Dunne and Casey played with their usual
coolness and showed the local boys some
new tips on backwall takes and low
ground send-ins.
The result of this game was:
Casey and Xealon 15 21 21 IS 21
Dunne and Bonnet 21 16 17 21 19
The scores of the other players were:
E. Lynch and E. McDonough defeated L.

Comstock was unable to determine the
cause. The loss will reach $500, which
was fully covered by insurance.
FACTS FOR SAN
JOSE VOTERS
Heavy Tax-Payers Lack
ing on the "Jim"
Rea Ticket.
Four Candidates Are Not on
the Assessment Rolls
at All.
On the Other Hand, the New Charter
Club Nominees Are Men
of Affairs. $
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, March 27.â There are
many more things to recommend the
ticket of the New Charter Club to the
favorable consideration c-f the people
of San Jose than the fact that it was
nominated by a body of men who are
thoroughly representative of the people
who make a community progressive
and prosperous.
At the present time the people are
represented in the Council and in the
offices of City Clerk and City Treas
urer by men who pay little or no taxes,
and it is to this fact that many attrib
ute the reckless extravagance that has
characterized the present administra
tion.
One of the features of the Charter
Club ticket is the large amount of taxes
that its candidates pay in the aggre- !
gate. This is nearly three times what
is paid by the men whom the "gang"
has put forward on its ticket. The
Charter Club ticket represents an as- I
sessed valuation of $356,444, while the
People's Municipal or "gang" ticket
pays taxes on but $130,145. Four men
on the "gang" ticket pay no taxes at ;
all, while c-n the Charter Club ticket
j there is but one man who is not on the
assessment roll.
The men on the "gang" ticket who j
do not figure on the county assessment |
I roll are J. W. Cook, candidate for re
j election as City Clerk; J. N. Ewing,
! candidate for re-election as City Treas-
I urer, and A. G. Bennett, candidate for
I membership on the Appointing Board.
P. P Austin, one of the "gang" candi
dates for membership on the Appoint
ing Board, is down on the county as
sessment roll for $3030, but he really
.owns no property of his own; so he i
j claims. That he does not pay taxes on !
i any property is further evidenced by j
the fact that there are four unsatisfied
] judgments aggregating more than $27,
: 000 standing out against him since IS9.V
In this connection it might not be
amiss to mention several interesting ;
circumstances that center about Aus- j
j tin in reference to the pending elec
tion. Everbody knows how close Aus
! tin is to Boss Rea. Austin is the man
! agor of the Security Savings Bank, and ;
with him on the "gang" ticket are no
i less than three other directors of the
j same institution â F. E. Snencer, H.
Booksln Sr. and Frank Stock.
As this is a campaign to secure a
business administration for the city of
San Jose, the question for the voter to
decide, among others, is which ticket
is likely to give such administration |
I Are the larger or the smaller taxpayers
I likely to best look after the city's in
terest?
If the "gang" Appointing Board Ist
elected its ruling spirit will be Paul P,
Austin, and he in turn will be abso
lutely controlled by "Boss" Rea. Aus
' tin is not a taxpayer, and is not likely ;
; to become one for some years to come, ;
as he must firpt wipp out an indebted
ness of more than $27,000. Rea is not
I a resident of the city. Therefore, if the
I "gang" ticket is elected, it will be un
der the joint control of a non-taxpayer
and a non-resident, neither of whom 'â 
will have any interest in protecting the
man who by h's hard earned money i
contributes to the maintenance of the
city government.
If the voters want their taxes judi
ciously and economically expended by
men who ar^ laree contributors to the
revenue of the city they must vote the
New Charter Club ticket straight. If
they want their funds used by non
taxnayers and non-residents to fatten
political trickFters and their favorites
they will votÂ» for the "gang" or Peo
ple's Municipal ticket.
NOW BEING PUT
ON A WAR FOOTING
Significant Activity in the Prepara
tion of the New Jersey Militia
for Emergencies.
TRENTON, N. J., March 27.â The
work of putting the New Jersey Na
tional Guard on a war footing is being
successfully pushed. Major-General
Plume, commanding the New Jersey
division of the National Guard, adju
tant-General Stryker and Quartermas
ter-General Donnelly held a conference
here last night to compare notes. They
expressed much satisfaction at the
work that had been done. Captain
Armstrong, of the quartermaster-gen
eral's office, returned last night from
Washington where he had gone to
hurry up the orders for ammunition
and ordnance stores. These latter will
be shipped to Trenton without delay.
Yesterday a lr.- Â«re number of army hats
and leggings and about 2000 rubber
blankets were received at the State ar
senal. Adjutant-General Stryker said
that no orders had yet been received
from Washington for the calling out of
the National Cuard or the militia, but
it was not denied that the preparations
were being made in the belief that such
a call might be made. There is talk of
a special session of the Legislature to
place a fund of $250,000 at the disposal
of the Governor for the better equip
ment of the National Guard in the
event of war.
NEGOTIATIONS FOR THE
CRUISER CARLO ALBERTO
In a Few Days It Will Be Known
Whether tne Italian Vessel May
Be Bought.
NEW YORK, March 27.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: It is
the expectation of administration offi
cials that the next few days will deter
mine whether or not the Italian |ar
mored cruiser Carlo Alberto is to riy
the American flag. Official information
was received by the authorities from
Rome to-day in regard to the action of
the Italian Chamber of Deputies in ap
proving the course adopted by the Min
ister of Marine in selling ships under
construction. The authorities under
stand from their information that Italy
will not sell ships actually in commis
sion, and if this refusal should be per
sisted in. then the authorities will un
doubtedly abandon their efforts to buy
Italian vessels.
It is admitted by the authorities that
active negotiations for the sale of the
Carlo Alberto are in progress, and it
will not be the fault of Commander
Richardson Clover, chief officer of the
Naval Intelligence Bureau, who is di
recting the: , if this Government fails
to procure her. One thing the authori
ties are absolutely certain of, and that
is if the United States does not acquire
the Italian cruiser Spain vill not do so.
It probably will be definitely deter
mined to-morrow or Tuesday whether
this Government will purchase the
steamer St. Paul for conversion into an
auxiliary cruiser. No action has as yet
been taken b<-' the authorities looking
to the conclusion of negotiations for
the purchase of this vessel.
GOMEZ SAYS SPAIN
CAN NEVER CONQUER
Her War in Cuba Has Resolved It
self Into One of Murder and
Kevengs.
Copyrighted. IS9B. by James Gordon Bennett.
HAVANA, via Key West, March 27.â
Recently a prominent American here,
a warm personal friend of General
Maximo Gomez, wrote to him, giving
him the full details and theories of
the Maine disaster and requested an
opinion. In his answer to this letter.
General Gomez made no direct refer
ence to the Maine affair. Here is his
letter:
SLAB VILLAS, March 9, IS9S.
Dear Sir and Friend: It is very agree
able for me to answer your favor of Feb
ruary 26, the contents of which amused
me and gave me great pleasure. Spain's
impotence to subdue this revolution either
by military force or political action is
well evidenced by developments that have
lately been taking place, and our deter
mination and purpose too well proclaimed
and proved that I should be required to
demonstrate them here, much less to a
person like your good self, who has
formed a complete judgment by your own
experience, of the respective situation of
both belligerent forces. At the stage that
things have reached every man of sense
understands that Spain's continuance of
this war is iniquitous and Inhumane and
even a menace to the peace of the world,
as a just and noble end is no longer pur
sued, but to kill and to destroy by a
sense of vengeance.
The great American republic Is destined,
by many causes, to intervene sooner or
later in some way in me termination of
the Cuban war, but her mediation may
only be fruitful of final peace. If through
it Cuba obtains her absolute independ
ence under this basis and by means of
indemnity of several millions, it Is pos
sible that our government would treat
for peace with Spain. This is the opinion
r<nd unanimous feeling among the Cuban
people, and particularly of its army of
liberation, which I have the honor to
command. With highest esteem, consid
eration and friendship, I am yours, com
mander-in-chief. M. GOMEZ.
SLIGHT DAMAGES TO
THE BATTLESHIP TEXAS
Struck on a Coral Reef While on
Duty in Her Station in South
ern Waters.
NEW YORK, March 27.â 0f all the
surmises made by reason of the sudden
trip to this port of the battle-ship
Texas none were correct. She struck
a coral reef while on her station in
Southern waters recently, and if this
was not the ab\ reason for her being
ordered to the Brooklyn Navy Yard, it
had much to do with the transfer.
The extent of the injury she suffered
will probably be known to-morrow,
when divers will make an examination
of her hull. It is likely that she will be
put in the drydock. The machinery of
her starboard turret is also out of gear
and will need extensive repairs.
That the Texas had struck the reef
was learned from two sources. A
workman who came over to this side
mentioned casually that he had heard
it from one of the seamen, and a petty
officer verified the statement when
pressed for an explanation of the
presence of the battle-ship here.
â "I can give you no further informa
tion," he said. '"It is a very small mat
ter, anyway, and I do not think the
accident caused the Texas to be sent to
the yard. Two or three matters need
attention. This may be one of them.
I understand that clivers will go down
to-morrow and examine her hull to see
whether it will be necessary to put her
in dock."
This officer said the Texas had merely
touched the reef in the neighborhood of
Dry Tortugas. The injury to the ves
sel's hull cannot be very serious or she
could not have made the trip north in
safety.
CALLS UPON CONGRESS
TO END BUTCH C RY.
Letter Sent by Chicago Typograph-
ical Union to Senator Mason
and Colleagues.
CHICAGO, March 27.â At the regu
lar meeting of Chicago Typographical
Union No. 16 held to-day, the follow
ing open letter was ordered telegraphed
to Washington:
W. E. Mason, Senator, and Colleagues,
"Washington: Chicago Typographical
Union No. 16 believes that the eloquent
appeals to the intelligence of the Ameri
can people by Senators Thurston, Proctor
and Gallinger in the United States Sen
ate on behaJf of the starving women and

in a position where their duty to ci%-iliza
tion and humanity is clear. This union,
therefore, calls upon the Chicago Con
gressmen and Senators of Illinois to in
sist upon the United States demanding
that the butchery, starvation and in
human policy pursued by Spain in Cuba
under the guise of so-called warfare shall
cease forthwith and in the name of hu
manity, which rises puperior to diplomacy
and precedent, to enforce such demand
immediatelyâ peaceably if possible; by
force of arms if necessary.

truth:
The truth about yourself is something like
this: You have been indiscreet enough to .
waste your powers. You have abused some
of the privileges with which you were en-
dowed by nature, and now you area sufferer.
Spots have already appeared before your
eyes, and your nerves are all half shattered.
You do not sleep at night the number of
hours you should, and you wake up tired
and without a particle of energy. And you
know, although ashamed of the fact, that to-
day you are only half a man. Get on your
thinking cap. Do you want to be a weak
and puny creature always ? If you will but
call at the Hudson/an Institute, or write
there for free advice, you will again be
placed on your feet. Then a part of your ,Â±
life will be shown to be just like this table : *

Percy Cotton Arrested on a Charge
of Assault to Murder.
Percy Cotton, a young man, was booked
at the City Prison yesterday afternoon on
a charge of assault to murder, but as the
wounded man refuses to prosecute, the
chances are that the case against him
will be dismissed.
From a statement made to the police it
seems that Cotton was visiting August
Vignaut at his room. 515 Connecticut
street, in the Potrero, and they began to
talk about revolvers. Vignaut said that
he couid take a revolver from Cotton be
fore he could fire it off. Cotton pulled
a revolver from his pocket, not knowing,
as he alleged, that it was loaded, and as
VisnAut mn.ie a dash for him he pulled
the trigger and a bullet struck Vignaut on
the chin, nearly tearing his jaw off and
making Its exit in the back of his neck.
Drs. De Witt and Simpson were sum
moned and attended to the wounded man.
Cotton was arrested by Policeman Cassin
and sent to Captain SpiUane. who de
cided that it was better for a Judge to
pass upon the case and ordered Cotton to
be locked up on a charge of assault to
murder. Drs. De Witt and Simpson sent
ft certificate to the effect that the wound
an ugly one, but not likely to prove
fatal.

HE MAY PROVE A COMER
A Utah Boy Who Is Anxious to Meet Any
and All Aspirants in His Class.
GEORGE BAKER, the New Aspirant for Bantam-Weight Honors.
George Baker, the new aspirant for the honors of the bantam-weight class, is
a native of Utah having been born in Salt Lake City just twenty years ago.
He began lifp as a printer, sen-ing his apprenticeship upon the Denver Times,
but he aspired to the fame of the prize-ring, so three years ago he began to fight.
Since that time he has not met with a single defeat, although he has gone
against some very clever men, both in and out of his class. His most recent
victory was the one that he gained Saturday night over Farmer O'Brien before
the Beacon Athletic Club of Berkeley. In this fight he was heavily outweighted.
Bakor is tall and of a slender build, but he is wiry and possesses good wind
and staying qualities. He is cool and never loses his head, no matter how se
verely he may get punished. He wears a continual smile, and uses a vicious left
hand jab that may win him fame and fortune 6ome day. He is now in the pink
of condition and tips the beam at 120 pounds. Among the fighters that have met
defeat at his hands are Kid Brooks, Johnnie Purcell, Spider Doyle, Mick Earl, ]
Jim Welsh, Jack Livingston and Curley McHale. J
UNION PARK.
For Freedom, the plucky English hound,
again demonstrated his ability to go the
pace that kills and yet land a winner.
In the presence of 6000 people yesterday
at Union Coursing Park, in the open
stake for all-aged hounds. For Freedom,
by perseverance, grit, speed and indomit
able courage, a second time won the final
course and first, money. He defeated Pre
tender, False Flatterer, Flying Buck,
Mountain Beauty and Lissak. Several of
these courses were long and tiresome,
and in them For Freedom' showed his
grit.
In the course with Flying Buck, in the |
third ties, the English dog was given a
strong argument, and two courses were j
run before it was decided. In the final i
he gave a great exhibition of stamina. !
Lissak showed better from the slip, but I
the hare was a strong one and the course i
long, and the American dog, while hay- j
ing much the best of it at the start, I
could not hold the pace, besides being out- I
general ed by For Freedom. Tne latter i
was a hot favorite, and was played by the
talent at prohibitive odds. In the finals 'â 
he opened at 7 to 10 and closed at 2 to 5.
The veteran stake was easily won by
Electric. In the final between Electric j
and Waratah, Judge Bull announced the
former as the winner, but the flag stew
ard misunderstood his order and raised j
the red flag. The pools paid off many
white tickets before the judge discovered '
that the wrong flag was up, and ordered â 
it down. Some plungers tore up red ,
tickets, and for a time there was much !
protesting and no little excitement.
The day's sport produced a number of
beautiful courses, but occasionally a bad
hare was loosed. Dr. Van Hummel sold
seven dogs from his kennels at a total
of $595. the hiphfst price being paid for
any one hound being $100. It was after 7 ;
o'< lock before the ouursing was over.

A NEW CHURCH
FOR CATHOLICS
Italians Lay the Cornerstone of
Their New Edifice at
Ocean View.
Father Prendergast Conducts the
Ceremony and Delivers
an Address.
The ceremony of laying the corner
stone of the Corpus Christ! Church, the
new house of tyorship for the Italian
Catholics in the Ocean View District, was
solemnly performed yesterday afternoon
by the Rev. Father Prendergast, V. G.,
of the cathedral.
The stone was laid in the southwest cor
ner of the foundation and consisted of a
solid block of marble eighteen Inches long
by twelve wide. On the front surface was
the inscription of the present year carved
in Roman numerals. Hollowed out of the
center was an oblong receptacle in which
was placed a zinc box, which was after
ward hermetically sealed.
The box contained a medal bearing
the image of Pope Leo XIII, a medal
consecrated to the Madonna, and an
American coin of the present year's mint
age. In addition to the medals, carefully
wrapped in a piece of parchment, was the
portrait of Don Bosco, the founder of the
Salesian Community.
On the under Fide of the cover of the
receptacle was the date of the present
year inscribed in Arabic numerals.
After the consecration of the stone and
its contents it was lowered into position
in the foundation of the building and
carefully mortared and secured against
displacement. During the ceremony of
laying the stone the Italian band, hired

EVOLUTION OF AN OAKLAND CHURCH.
From the Very Smallest Beginning It Becomes a Great
PoWer.
Plans for the complete renovation of the
Interior of the First Methodist Episcopal
Church of Oakland that will make the pa
rent church of the denomination one of
the most beautiful in Alameda County
as well as one of the largest. The foun
dations of the church have been com
pletely rebuilt and a new roof placed over
it. as well as some other minor altera
tions which will add to the appointments.
It is also contemplated to effect changes
In tho exterior and front which will widen
the doors and permit freer egress. The
for the occasion, rendered a number or
American and Italian patriotic airs.
The Rev. Father Sardi of St. Ignatius
Church delivered an address in Italian,
the purport of which was the request that
the Italian Catholics of the district would
manifest a pride in their new church and
contribute liberally toward assisting the
new priests In their work of ridding the
edifice of whatever debt will bo con
tracted in its erection.
Fully 3000 people, mostly Italians, par
ticipated in the ceremony yesterday after
noon and the inhabitants of the district
for miles around flocked to the vicinity
to get a glimpse of the interesting stone
and its curious contents.
Fathers Cassius, Oreni and Redahao
will be stationed at the new church. It
has been rumored that when the new
church and the parochial residence are
completed a convent will be erected in
the rear of the former.
The church, which has been in process
of construction for the past month, will
be hurried to completion so as to allow
the celebration of mass for the first time
next Sunday morning. The framework is
now entirely completed and during the
coming week it is expected that the roof
and sides will be completely shingled.
Easter Sunday morning the dedication
ceremony will be held.
YOUNG THIEVES IN JAIL.
Chief Jailer Sattler Has an Unwel-
come Quartet in the Broad
way Bastile.
Chief Jailer Sattler has four young
criminals in the County Jail that he
would very much prefer to pet rid of, not
that the Chief Jailer is opposed to ac
commodate the criminal class with bed
and board, but in this case the inmates
are all under the age of 1G years. Two
of the boys are in prison for stealing a
few bottles of soda water from an ojÂ»ter
saloon on Third street. Their names are:
E. Kirby, alias Yerby, aged 13, and Emil
Holloway, aged 14. These two lads, with
another boy named Sam Ridge, while go
ing for their morning papers on the 6th
lnst. saw the oyster saloon open and they
went in and helped themselves to the
soda water. Unfortunately for them a
vigilant police officer saw them and
placed them under arrest upon the
charge of burglary. On this they were
held to answer before the Superior Court
by Judge Campbell. The other two are a
few years older, and are charged with a
graver offense. Orazzlo " Salvinl was
caught while trying to clean out a store
in which there was an assortment of
pickled olives. He Is aged 10. but small
for his years. The other boy is John
Dagnio, and is aged 15. He is charged
with highway robbery in having garroted
a German boy whom he met on the street
and relieved him of a witch and chain.
Each of the boys is willing to plead
guilty in anxiety to get away from the
County Jail.
Columbia School Closed.
Out of respect to the memory of Miss

"WINDY AND DISAGREEABLE." , .
When a man blows wind off his stomach, that is flatulence.
Sometimes people call it. gulping Wind. No matter what you call it,
the disease, for it is a disease, is an annoying one to you and disgust-
ing to your friends. I once heard a politician speak of a rival, whom
he did not admire, as a flatulent old fool. â¢ Flatulent means windy. .
Usually we mean by it wind collected in the stomach. Wind in the
intestines may also be just as. properly designated flatulence. It is
always caused by indigestion. A physician, who practices in a town
' near Albany, New York, reports the case of an old gentleman who
. had been so annoyed by a persistent condition of flatulence that he
had consulted all the doctors in the rtcinity without securing any*
benefit. "Finally he came to me and I prescribed several remedies, â 
which failed utterly. I then prescribed Ripens Taboles, which he re- s
ported gave him immediate relief, and he is now nearly cured. I think :
it would be an excellent thing to make a strong feature of "flatulence -V

OUR COMMERCIAL STATUS.
THE feeling in trade was again unsettled last
week, owing purely to the war scare. As usual,
Wall street was feverish and irregular, and
stucks responded on the moment to both favorable
and unfavorable rumors from Washington, showing
extreme sensitiveness of securities to current condi
tions. Press reports state that the public is entirely
out of the market and the larger holders are also
taking comparatively little interest, though foreigners
are sellers to some extent. Industrial operations,
however, have not been perceptibly affected, and mer
chandising is going on as usual. There is no strin
gency in the money market. The bank clearings of
the country are 22 per cent larger than last year, and
the failures 30 per cent smaller, hence, as ono author
ity tersely puts it, "it is difficult to take dismal
views when the nation is surpassing all previous
commercial records." The inflow of gold from
Europe now amounts to over $34,000,000 since the
movement began, and the end is apparently not yet.
The exports of wheat from the Atlantic Coast last
week were 2,160.000 bushels, against 1,272,000 for the
same week last year, and the most flattering reports
regarding the distributive trade are being received
from the West and Northwest. The only two staples
which are really dull are wool and cotton, while to
offset this we have an iron trade which is simply
booming. The activity in this line is unprecedented,
the mills all over the country being rushed with
orders. At Chicasro, for instance, an enormous de
mand for new cars and farming tools and implements
is reported, with a structural demand exceeding that
of any previous year by 80 per cent. There is, how
ever, an unfavorable feature to all this, inasmuch as
decreases in prices are more numerous than for some
time past, though they are chiefly in articles of specu
lation rather than those of regular consumptive trade.
The local markets are almost devoid of feature.
General trade is good, as shown by the bank clear
ings of San Francisco, which were 30 per cent larger
last week than for the same week last year. The close
of the week was distinguished by an advance in
wheat and barley, the former rising in sympathy
with higher Eastern and foreign markets, and the
latter owing to the dry weather. There was a fine
shower on Friday in the Salinas and San Joaquin
valleys, but it was less than an inch, hence it was
hard!\ r enough, but was infinitely better than noth
ing and made the farmers feel brighter. The most
unfavorable feature at the moment is the widespread
damage to several kinds of fruit, notably apricots
and peaches, by the long-continued cold weather. It
is now conceded that the apricot crop of the State will
be practically nil this year, and the peach crop will
be too light for the usual large output of canned and
dried fruit. Prunes have not suffered as much as
the others up to the present writing, and the pears,
apples and grapes remain untouched as yet. The hay
crop looks poorly, and buyers are already in the field
bidding $15 for new oat hay, which is about 100 per
cent better than the usual opening price of this de
scription. The farmers are generally refusing to sell
at this figure, but it is all guesswork on both sides.
It is admitted by all, however, that this important
staple will open far above its usual figure.
The question of feed has become a serious, one.
It has caused the shifting of cattle from one point to
another, has led to the withdrawal of all extra horses
from ordinary business and has sent in larger supplies
of hogs to this market for sale, besides affecting
butchers' prices more or less. In fact it is cutting in
many directions.
In spite of all these drawbacks, however, the con
dition of trade is better than at this time last year.
The increase in the volume of business is well illus
trated by the overland shipments of produce and
merchandise from California during February, which
were 41,659 tons, against 17,582 tons in February,
iS97.
Twice has ex-District Attorney Page been found
guilty of the meanest type of embezzlement and twice
have the courts granted him a new trial on a foolish
technicality which has no possible bearing upon the
merits of the case. It is a thing like this which tends
to rob the courts of the respect people would be glad
to feel for them if they were permitted to do so. It
h claimed that no demand had been made upon Page
for a return of the stolen money, and so far as actual
words are concerned this may be true. Yet the cir
cumstance of arrest on the charge of stealing might
be construed into a strong insinuation that the return
of the loot was considered desirable. If Page has the
money concealed about his person and yearns to make
restitution he should not let a diffidence due to the
fact that he had not been asked for it stand in the
way of handing it over. The law was not made for
the benefit of rogues, and when the courts permit it
to be twisted about so that such seems to be its pur
pose they are not doing their duty, and no defensive
technicality can be projected into the situation,
either.
THE PRESIDENT'S PROGRAMME.
ACCORDING to reports from Washington it
is the intention of the President to send to
Congress this morning the findings of thÂ«*
Naval Board of Inquiry concerning the cause of the
destruction of the Maine, with the information that
he has acquainted the Spanish Government with the
results of the inquiry. He will follow this to-morrow
or Wednesday with a message on the condition of the
non-combatants in Cuba and will ask of Congress
an appropriation for their immediate relief.
As the President will so soon speak for himself, it
is useless at this time to attempt to forecast what he
will say. The programme as outlined promises a
policy that will meet the approval of the country. It
is evidently the intention of the President to take on
the issue a position that will have not only the sup
port of all loyal Americans, but of the civilized world.
The question of indemnity for the destruction of the
Maine is not to be permitted to overshadow the even
greater question from the standpoint of humanity, of
relief for the starving and destitute people of Cuba
who are suffering from the intolerable wrongs in
flicted by despotic government and barbarous war
fare.
Congress and the country have shown abundant
confidence in the President. A sum of $50,000,000 has
been voted for him to employ at his discretion in
providing for national defense, no effort has been
made to force his hand, nothing has been said or
done in either house to embarrass him, the most
intense partisans have made no attempt to discredit
his methods of procedure for the sake of making
points for use in the coming Congressional cam
paigns. He has had a free hand and full support from
all parties and classes of the people and from all sec
tions of the Union. His message will go far to show
whether this confidence has been well or ill placed.
The people expect of him something in the nature of
an ultimatum, and if it is not forthcoming the week
in Congress will be stormy and wrathful.
McKinley can find in the message sent to Congress
in 1854 by President Pierce in relation to the seizure
of the Black Warrior a precedent which will serve
him as something of a model in this juncture. Pierce,
after pointing out that the Black Warrior case did
not stand alone, but that "there have been in the
course of a few years past many other instances of
aggression upon our commerce, violations of the
rights of American citizens and insults to the national
flag by Spanish authorities in Cuba," went on to say,
"All attempts to obtain redress have led to protracted
and as yet fruitless negotiations." He then added:
"In case the measures taken for amicable adjust
ment of our differences with Spain should unfortu
nately fail, I shall not hesitate to use the authority
and means which Congress may grant to insure the
observance of our just rights, to obtain redress for
injuries received and to vindicate the honor of our
flag. In anticipation of that contingency, which I
ertnestly hope may not arise, I suggest to Congress
the propriety of adopting such provisional measures
as the exigency may seem to demand."
Some such message as that in the present temper of
the people and of Congress would settle the crisis
and put an end to the feeling of uncertainty. It is in
confident expectation of it that the country waits the
message which is to make known the President's
policy.
A NEW PHILOSOPHY IN CONGRESS.
\A R. WALKER of Massachusetts is regarded
/ \ as one of the leading political economists in
*â  * Congress. He is chairman of the House
Committee on Banks and Banking, is always one of
the most conspicuous speakers on questions of tariff
and finance, is a director of a bank and a manufac
turing company, a member of the American Acad
emy of Political and Social Science, a trustee of the
American Institute of Civics, trustee of Brown Uni
versity and of Newton Theological Seminary and
president of the board of trustees of Worcester
Academy. He is also several other kinds of a digni
tary, and altogether one who has a right to say, "I
am Sir Oracle, and when I speak let no dog bark."
This eminent master of social and political econ
omy has just propounded in Congress a new phil
osophy and thereby won another title to fame. He
achieved the distinction in the course of a discussion
on the comparative conditions of factory operatives
in New England and the Southern States, and pro
pounded his novel theory in reply to an assertion of
a Southern Representative that owing to the smaller
cost of the necessaries of life in the South the South
ern workingman saved more money out of his wages
than the Northern worker. Lest we may be sus
pected of garbling Mr. Walker's economic discovery
we will quote exactly as it is printed in the Con
gressional Record the paragraph in which he an
nounced it to an applauding House. Mr. Walker
said:
"Let me say to the gentlemen on the other side
that each man in this country cannot save 10 per
cent of his earnings or income without the nation
going back to barbarism in a hundred years. Under
natural law and economic conditions it is only the
few who can save. The economic law of the race
is that enough will saye â that enough are so en
dowed with acquisitiveness and the administrative
faculty that they will accumulate enough to employ
the balance. All men ought not to save and do not
save. All spend that all may live in comfort. It is
in spending that civilization advances. Why we
have in our town four or five men to-day who have
fifty to a hundred thousand dollars who yet live on
an income of five or six hundred dollars a year,
and if we all did it we would all go back to barbar
ism. They are practically the worst citizens we
have. (Laughter and applause.) I tell you it is in
the act of spending the race gets on and not in the
act of saving." (Applause.)
It is fortunate for Benjamin Franklin that his
bones are buried in Pennsylvania and not in the soil
of his native State, or this doctrine uttered from the
lips of a Massachusetts man in answer to a thrifty
speech from the son of a wasteful cavalier of the
Sunny South would have ruffled his rest and made
him uncomfortable in his grave. "A penny saved is
a penny earned" was Franklin's doctrine, and the
old philosopher would hardly be able to comprehend
such a proposition as that of the new man.
Mr. Walker, it is safe to say, does not spend all
that he earns. He is content to leave to other men
the advance of the nation. He takes his place among
the ranks of the worst citizens and practices thrift
while urging workingmen to spend freely. This fact
of course does not detract from the value of his
teaching, for no apostle of a new creed can be ex
pected to practice what he preaches. The only point
we make upon it is that the difference between the
life and the lesson is so striking that it needs eluci
dation. Mr. Walker should write a book.
If the Minnesota widow who wants $1000 from a
man who rashly ventured to hug her is not over
estimating the value of that operation she must in
deed be a charming woman.
THE SAIN" FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 28, 1898.
THE RESPONSE OF THE GOVERNORS.
GOVERNOR BUDD'S letter to the Governors
of the States of the Great West requesting
them to appoint committees to attend a con
vention for the purpose of formulating a plan of
joint action in celebrating the semi-centennial of the
admission of California to the Union has been cor
dially responded to, and assurances have been given
that the enterprise will be warmly supported. It is
thus apparent that the movement will be something
more than a State undertaking and that the proposed
exposition will be one of the greatest in design and
accomplishment ever carried out in the United
States.
The letters of response which have been received
up to date have been published in The Call and they
show the wide extent of territory which will be inter
ested in the enterprise. Among them are letters
from the Governors of such distant States as Minne
sota and Nebraska. These States, which by us are
regarded as parts of the East, are, however, essen
tially Western in history, development and sympathy.
Their Governors promise a cordial co-operation in
the movement for the celebration, and their progres
sive citizens will take a pride in assisting to make the
first great Western exposition a genuine triumph for
this section of the Union.
The cordial tone of these responses from other
States should be felt by Californians as an incentive
to earnest efforts in promoting the enterprise. It will
devolve upon California to lead the way and take the
initiative. When the interstate convention assembles
the delegates from this State should be prepared to
submit a programme of work which will at least fur
nish a basis for discussion even if it be not sufficiently
broad to be generally satisfactory. That much will
be expected of us and we must not permit the ex
pectation to be disappointed.
It will be seen that the sooner we get to work the
better. The time between now and iooo is none too
long for the task of preparing for such an undertak
ing as this is designed to be. We have invited our
sister States to join with us in a movement to aug
ment the prestige of the Great West and their Gov
ernors have responded with words of warm accept
ance. Now let us be ready to welcome the conven
tion and all its delegates in true Western style and
Californian hospitality.
THE JURY-BOX STUFFERS.
JUDGE HUNT and his coHeagues on the bench
have shown a commendable zeal in searching
out the parties who are responsible for tampering
with the boxes containing the lists from which the
jurymen are drawn for service in the Superior Courts.
It is to be hoped the zeal will not diminish no matter
in which direction the evidence may point. The
offense is one of the rankest that could be committed
tinder our system of society, and the offenders,
whether high or low, should by all means be dragged
from concealment, disclosed to the public, convicted
and punished with the utmost severity of the law.
The difficulties in the way of finding legal evidence
against the criminals may be great, but with patience
and perseverance there will be found a means to
overcome them. No matter how clever a rascal may
be, he always leaves behind him some trace of
his work. This is especially true of offenders who
have been practicing a particular sort of fraud for a
long time. They are careful at first, but, growing
bolder as they progress, they at last become careless
and then exposure comes swift and sharp. There is
reason to believe that this is what has happened in the
case of those responsible for the stuffing of the jury
lists, and if so it needs only a persistent and sagacious
pursuit to catch them and bring them to justice.
While the offense is not what is known as a sen
sational crime and has not "startled the community,"
it has nevertheless made a profound impression upon
the more intelligent and reflecting class of citizens
and will not be lost sight of until it has reached its
proper conclusion. A cloud upon the jury-box is
a cloud upon our whole legal system, and Judge
Hunt can render no better service to the community
than that of confirming public confidence in the es
sential impartiality and fairness of our juries by
bringing to punishment any one who has violated the
law which regulates their selection.
THE MERCANTILE LIBRARY.
THE men and women who are engaged in the
task of saving the Mercantile Library from what
seems an impending bankruptcy deserve the cor
dial support and help of the community generally.
Their labors are for the public good, and they have
a right to appeal to all who have regard for the
literary advantages and mental culture of the city to
assist them with energy and with money to accom
plish it.
It matters not by what unfavorable conditions, ad
verse circumstances, mistakes or errors of manage
ment the Mercantile Library has arrived at its present
perplexing condition. It is sufficient to know it is
one of the institutions of which the city has a right to
be proud, to which a large number of people owe
much, which has had a career of usefulness in the
past, is useful now, and may be even more useful in
the future, and that it needs help to tide over an
emergency in its affairs which threatens it with dis
solution unless help is forthcoming. To know the
merits of the library and to know what are its urgent
requirements should be sufficient to prompt every
one in proportion to his means to give the aid that
is needed.
We have none too many libraries in San Francisco.
Any institution of the kind would have a rightful
dairy on popular support. In this particular case the
claim is augmented by the worth and dignity of the
library that makes the appeal. The Mercantile is one
of the oldest of our civic institutions. It represents
one of the earliest efforts of our people to provide for
a broad and deeply cultured intellectual life at a time
when few persons expected San Francisco to be any
thing more than a trading center. It is an honor
able monument of the co-operative efforts of former
days, and if for no other reason should be so sup
ported as to be made perpetual.
The strong feature of the Army and Navy Jour
nal is its conservatism. This publication says that
the dispatch of the Spanish flotilla to Porto Rico is
an act of war. Now is the time for some complacent
advocate of peace at the price of any insult to rear
on his hind legs and denounce the journal as a jingo.
Announcement that one of Pulitzer's war editors
has brain fever will be received with more or less
incredulity. There is a common impression that he
has nothing to have it with.
It is learned from one oi the evening papers that
Salisbury has retired, and from another that he has
no thought of taking such a step, all of which goes
to prove the value of accuracy.
PHOTOGRAPH OF AN ELECTRIC SPARK.
POSITIVE POLE.
SOME very Interesting and Instructive
experiments in photographing the
electric spark have lately been made
by M. Henry Langumler, in charge
of the course of practical electricity given
at the "Bourse dv Travail" to the mem
bers of the Association of Firemen and
Engineers, at Paris. The results of one of
these experiments are shown on the ac
companying illustration, taken from a
half-tone picture in a recent number of
L'lliustration.
It is about half the natural size, and
represents an electric spark sixteen centi
meters in length, which was obtained di
rectly and without the aid of any lens in
a chamber or lecture room completely
darkened. A sensitive plate was set in in
sulating clamps and to It were fastened
at the opposite ends the two extremities
of the wires from the poles of an induc
tion coil.
The spark was furnished by an in
duced current of about 45,000 volts from a
Ruhmkorff coil, which was operated by a
primary current of eight volts and four
amperes. As the spark passed over the

little while and on . her return to her
home on wheels walked down Fourth
street to her destination instead of taking
a street car. She was accompanied by a
couple of theatrical people besides one or
two Willie-boy admirers, who, knowing
the charming Anna's love of comfort and
distaste for any sort of unnecessary phy
sical exertion, wondered why she should
elect to walk instead of riding, particu
larly such a distance and at such a time,
the hour being considerably after ten.
They had not gone far before they passed
a green-grocer's and Miss Held stopped
and purchased a bunch of asparagus,
which she handed to one of her admirers,
who not only carried it, but gallantly in
sisted on paying for it. At the next shop
a bundle of spinach was acquired, which
was paid for and carried by admirer No.
2 Then, in quick succession, a market,
a fruit store and a fish stall were visited
and purchases made, which were paid for
by the different male members of the
party until every one of the crowd was
packing something that promised to de
velop into a toothsome dish under the
skillful handling of a good cook. Miss
Held herself brought up the rear, carry
ing a large sized crab tied to the end of
a string. To the numerous interroga
tories put to her with the purpose of as
certaining what she Intended to do she
would return the one answer to wait and
see the artist she had for a cook, so the
gentlemen who were carrying the dif
ferent articles trotted along contentedly,
cheered by visions of the delightful mid
night supper that would reward them for
their trouble and devotion when the car
should at last have been' reached. It is
a long lane that has no turning and
Fourth street is no exception to other
lanes. When the party stood beside the
car they heaved a sigh of relief, and,
handing their bundles to the servant, they
prepared to mount the steps which were
to lead them to the interior and supper.
Miss Held, however, had a surprise in
store for them which they little suspected.
Standing on the platform she expressed
her regret that the lateness of the hour
prevented her from asking them in and
then, thanking them for their kindness
in carrying the parcels, which she in
formed them were destined to charm the
palate of Tod Sloan, who was to dine
with her on the morrow, she bade them a
smiling good night and vanished. To say
the gentlemen of the party were crest
fallen would be putting It mildly. They
were crushed.

NO OBJECTION TO THESE.
While there is a general feeling against

Europe no one will have a word to say
against 605 steerage passengers who ar
rived last week on the Kaiser Wilhelm.
Their average age was 25 years old and
they brought $21,460 with them, had rail
road tickets to their destination and knew
exactly where they wanted to go. A

countrymen are already settled and are
developing that great agricultural terri

NEGATIVE POLE.
sensitive coating of the plate from one
end to the other It left the curious evi
dences of Its ways and wanderings per
manently marked thereon. The plata
was then developed and from the nega
tive the picture for L'lllustratlon was
printed directly from the etching plate.
Photographic results somewhat similar
to the above have been produced before
by the aid of iron filings or sulphur pow
der scattered over the sensitive plate,
which, of course, to a greater or less de
gree, affected the course and character of
the spark and the resulting picture.
In this instance, however, we are as
sured by M. Langumier that the spark
which he has reproduced was absolutely
natural, the opposing electricities being
entirely free to exert themselves In every
direction but that of the sensitive plate.
It is to be noticed that the negative pole
of the spark takes the form of a branch
of fern, while the positive pole takes that
of a bunch of hairy roots. This accounts
for the curious vegetable-like appear
ances that are often to be found indelibly
marked on the skin of persons who have
been struck by lightning.
THJE BITTER RIVER WARRIORS.

You'd ort to seen us fellers stand
A nghtin' battles at the bar!
There want a Bitter River chap.
From Colonel Tom to Kid McLane,
That wasn't achin" fur a scrap.
All spattered up with blood, with Spain.
We'd stand an" diagnose the news
'Atween our fretfuent snifts o' booze.
Ol' Colonel Tom he said that he
Was in the wor o' Sixty-one.
An' reckoned he was up In O,
A pumpin' bullets through a grun.
Fur bravery in facin' death
His name was on the honor roll â
An' then he'd reinforce his breath
By h'istin' in another bowl.
An' we Jes' cheered till we was hoarse;
Him settin' up the drinks, of course.
An' One-Eyed Riley, he chipped In
By sayin' that he marched an' fit
All over sacred ol 1 Virgin.,
An' used to make the rebels git.
He reckoned he was Jes' as brave
As any man that foliered Grant,
An' many a rebel soger grave
He'd furnished with an occupant.
An' now if war should come, you bet
We'd see he was a fighter yet.
Then Shorty Norton said that when
You talked o1o 1 desp'rit fightin', he
Was one o' them same rebel men
That tuk his dose along with Lee.
It used to be his one delight.
As Lee an' all his comrades knew.
To hunt the thickest o' the fight
An' plug them sassy boys in blue.
An' If a call for sogers come
We'd see him steppin' to the drum.

An' Windy Jim an' Scrapper White â
In short the hull durr.ed River crowd
Was all a itchln' fur a fight.
An' when ol* Colonel Tom once more
Set up the devil lightnin', and
Got oft* a spec-ch 'bout sptllln' gore
We 'lected him to take command.
An' swore that In the bloody fray
We'd foller him through Helena.
Nex' day we found a written call
Stuck up In front o' Jackson's store.

To givp their sarvlce to the war.
It drawed a quite excited crowd,
An' 't wasn't very hard to see
That talkin' wasn t near so loud
Nor bloody as It used to be. '
None of us hadn't much to say,
An' said it, in a quiet way.

That he was old an' full o' pain.

To knock the stuffln' out o' Spain,

NEWS Of FOREIGN NAVIES.
The Russian contract for armor plates,
recently given to the Carnegie mills, is
for two armored gunboats.
The Hai-Shen. the third of the three
Chinese protected cruisers of 2960 tons,
was launched at Stettin, February 12.
The contract delivery of these three ships
will be exceeded by nearly six months.
Contract for an armored cruiser of 7700
tons, to be named Kleber. has been given
to the Chantlers et Atelier de la Gironde
Company. The ship is to be delivered in
fifty-one months, dating from December
9 of last year, and to be ready for her
official test three months later.
Another British torpedo-boat destroyer,
the Sturgeon, has come to grief. During
a protracted sea trip something went
wrong and she limped into Portsmouth
under the starboard engine. An ex
amination revealed the fact that the
struts of the port propeller had broken
off and that the shaft was bent and twist
ed, the rudder smashed and the hull bad
ly damaged.
A pair of sheer legs 150 feet in length, to
lift 100 tons, are to be erected at the De
vonport dockyard/ The cost of the sheers
and machinery will be $55,000. The item
recalls the fact that a similar work was
accomplished at the Mare Island Navy
yard In 18S7, where the sheer legs and
machinery were built In the department
of steam engineering under Chief En
gineer Kutz for the sum of $44,375, or
nearly $6000 less than that now being built
in the British dockyard.
The European pressâ excepting that of
Russiaâ is greatly worked up over the
mystery which surrounds the departure
of two Russian battle-ships from the
Black Sea. The treaty stipulation be
tween Turkey an, Russia expressly for
bids any Russian war vessel to pass the
Dardanelles, and hitherto the Sultan has
only given permission to vessels of the
Russian volunteer fleet to pass through
the Bosphorus. The armor-clads referred
to as having violated the treaty stipula
tions are said to have sneaked through
in the nighttime, and an investigation Is
on foot to locate the responsibility.
A Royal Naval Reserve man on board
the British armored cruiser Australia has
got himself in serious trouble and thrown
discredit upon this auxiliary branch of
the naval service. The ship was lying at
Portsmouth and a lot of stores were
broken out of the room adjoining the
magazine. The R. N. R. man saw some
pistols such as are used for firing night
signals, and grabbing one fired Into a
bunch of fuses lying on a shelf and a
fusillade of exploding fuses was the re
sult. A regular blue Jacket at once threw
a bundle of the fuses outside the door of
the storeroom and fire was communicated
to a pile of serge and fearnought. An
alarm of flre was m*le. hoses stretched
and water soon extinguished the blazing
woolen stuff, and the R. N. R. individual
was escorted by a guard of marines to the
guardhouse. His explataiion that he did
not know it was loaded" will not save him
from a court-martial and merited punish

AGAINST^fhFcUBANS.
San Francisco, March 25 1893.
Editor Call-Dear Sir: While public sen
timent appears to be so^ bitterly opposed
to the consideration of an> thin g that
would tend to relieve Spain of the ' <^> vâ¢u â¢
that the Maine disaster has created It
may seem out of place to say a: thing
that would tend to lessen the hatred of
the American people against that nation.
Nevertheless I cannot forbear to direct
the intelligent reader's attention to some
pertinent considerations that even tne
extremest patriotism should not sanction.
The people of these United States, we are
told, are wearied with the continuous
warfare that has been maintained witn
so little valuable result and so much use
less suffering in the "Queen of the An
tilles" and they propose to put an end to
it by demanding that Spain having been
unsuccessful either in subjugating or
coaxing the subjects of its rebellious col
ony should give them their liberty. The
excuse for this demand is primarily that
this incessant strife in Cuba is damaging
to the commercial interests of this repub
lic and incidentally that the suffering of
the Cubans should come to an end. I ad
mit that the commercial claim is a good
one but when we begin to lament the
cruelties of war we are depending upon
the ignorance of our listeners for ap
plause A war that has no cruelties is
no war and the more merciless a war is
the more successful it becomes. More
over in the instance under consideration,
the misery of those who are complaining
is entirely of their own making, as loy
alty to the Spanish crown would secure
them protection and better government
than the nondescript blood of the rebel
lious movement could ever provide. \\ c
are told by the telegraphic dispatches
from those who profess to know the
Presidential mind that our chief execu
tive is preparing a manifesto for the
Spanish Government demanding large in
demnity from that nation (which is quite
proper) and also demanding that as it has
been impossible for Spain to conquer the
Cubans, in the interest of humanity the
war should be stopped and freedom given
to them. There is no sense nor justice in
this demand. If the only solution of a
war is that one of the belligerents should
cease fighting, who shall have the right to
decide which party shall lay down its
arms? Would it not accomplish as much
if Mr. McKinley should say to the insur
gents that if they did not cease their
fighting at once this country would help
Spain to compel them to do so? Unques
tionably It would. It is quite proper that
Spain should pay for the loss of tho
Maine, but absolutely wrong that this
Government should seek to interfere for
the benefit of the Cuban rebels. More es
pecially does it seem wrong as this coun
try has tacitly sympathized with and aid
ed the insurgent movement in very many
waysâ which aid and which sympathy has
emboldened the one side and embittered
the other. THOMAS H. KERR.
ONE GREAT UNITED COUNTRY.
Roanoke (Va.) News.
General Wade Hampton's advice to
Southern men to stay at home and let
the North furnish the troops, if war is de
clared against Spain, is narrow, sectional
and wholly repugnant to the feelings of
the brave followers of Lee arid Stonewall
Jackson. We are one great country un
der one flag, and it is admitted by patri
ots all over the land that a declaraHon of
war would have the effect of abolishing
sectional lines, and that In the future
there would be no North, no South, no

Look at the proportion between the to

the public debt and he who fears war
with Spain may be reassured that the
hostilities may occur only between the
treasuries at Washington and Madrid. It
is far more likely to be a battle of dol

LARGE CROWD AT THE PARK.
Bicyclists Meet With a Serious Ac

There were, perhaps, two reasons for
"the large number of people at Golden
Gate Park yesterdayâ the fine weather
and the stoppage of the running of trains
on the Park and Beach Railroad. Many
who had started for the Cliff and Sutro

FLED WHEN
POOR BURKE
WAS SHOT
The Murder of the
Lieutenant to Be
Investigated.
His Companions Must
Answer for Their
Cowardice.
Detective Cody Makes a Lengthy
Report of the Killing to
Chief Lees.
KENNEDY'S STATEMENT.
He Makes a Futilo Attempt to Ex
plain Why He Ran
Away.
Acting under instructions from the
Police Commissioners, Chief Lees is
making a thorough Investigation of the
charge that the four policemen who ac
companied Lieutenant Burke on his
mission when he was shot down by
Hayn.es, the murderous tinker, acted
with surprising cowardice. Last night
he sent for Policeman Kennedy, who
was with the brave lieutenant when
he was killed. Kennedy tried to ex
cuse himself by claiming that he fired
four shots at Haynes after Burke fell
mortally wounded. In explanation of
his first statement that he retreated
after Haynes had shot his victim he
said that he knew the bloodthirsty
tinker would not hesitate to kill him.
"Knowing he was well supplied with
ammunition," he claimed, "I ran
around to the corner of the shanty and
emptied my revolver at him. I failed
to hit him, and as I had exhausted my
ammunition I went in search of more.
It was then that Haynes reappeared
and took possession of the dead lieuten
ant's gun."
Detective Cody, who has been spe
cially detailed by the Chief of Police
to make a thorough investigation of
the facts of the shooting, last night
made a lengthy report to his superior
officer. The report will be read at the
meeting of the Police Commissioners
to-night, and unless they are satisfied
that the officers acted with becoming
bravery they will be at once cited to
appear before them and show cause
why they should not be dismissed from
the force. _^___^________

rested yesterday afternoon by Policeman
Mangan on a charge of cruelty to
animals.
According: to the police. Martin has been
in the habit of indulging In periodical
drunks ami neglecting his two horses.
Word was sent to the O'Farrell-street
station Saturday night that the horses
wre starving, and Siangan -was sent to

the animals had not been attended to ap
parently for several days, and in their
hunger had eaten the wood of their
manners. Mangan procured two bales of
hay and fed the animals, and yesterday
ho discovered Martin, who had been on
one of his drunks, and placed him under
arrest. The horses are being well cared
for now.

Yesterday afternoon the Tivoli was
crowded to the doors by the patriotic
audience which had gathered to witness
the performance of "Widow O'Brien"
that was given for the benefit of the fund
being raised for the erection of a monu
nv-ut to the memory of the brave sailor
boys who perished when the Maine was
destroyed by Spanish treachery in Ha
vana narbor.
A handsome souvenir programme was
gotten up for the occasion, which was
suid at the door for whatever the pur
chaser chose to give, and it was notice
able that, as the audience filed in, nearly
every one bought a programme, and the
amount they paid for it was generally
the largest piece of silver they had in
their pockets.
Besides the regular performance, spe

the master of the vessel, reports a rather
fair trip with but few accidents, lie
â ailed from Papeete about noon on Feb
ruary 15, and when about two hours out
was struck by a northeast gale, changing
to northwest. In this squall a number
of sails were lost and more split. From
the loth to the Ist of the present month
nothing but light winds were met with,
but from the Ist to the Gth inst., when
the Hawaiian Islands were reached, the
vessel experienced some strong northeast
gales and heavy squalls, during which
considerable water was shipped. The re
mainder of the trip was pleasant. As the
Tropic Bird must leave nere by the Ist
of next month in order to fulfill her mail
contract. Captain Jackson will be very
busy while In port.

AN ORIENTAL WORSHIPS A MACHINE AS A GOD.
That the mechanical contrivance s that are the delight of the present
generation are a matter of mystery and awe to the untutored minds of
the gentle Orientals was illustrated in a queer scene that was enacted In the
lobby of Morosco's Grand Opera House several days ago.
In that portion of the house are two machines into which people drop a
nickel and are told their weight and are pleased with sweet music.
A Jap, recently from his native soil, unused to modern invention, hap
pened to be near when some child had thus been parting with his nickel
and watched the thing with awe. He waited around until there was no one
evidently looking and then knelt down before the musical machine and
started in worshiping it and praying aloud in his native tongue, every once
in a while allowing his face to touch the ground. After this procedure
he with reverence approached the machine and again bowed low. Gradu
ally he gained courage and placed a 50-cent piece on the Bcales, but no
music was heard. Again he repeated his act, placing 50 cents more, but
still the soul of the great "machine" spoke not to him. Still once more he
placed a like amount of money on the device and still once more no sound
was heard. Then, crestfallen, he left the money and was about to depart,
when an onlooker called him back. The Japanese paid no heed and at last
the man took the money and gave it back to the deluded Oriental. At
this the Jap flew into a rage and replaced the money, trying to show by
signs that the "big god" was displeased. He wrote something on a paper
in Japanese and left. When it was translated it was found the writing was
simply his nameâ "Sasake." Mr. Morosco is keeping the money in an en
velope, waiting for some of his countrymen to explain the mysteries of the
machine and thinking that the Jap will come and reclaim his money.

FROM A BOY
Lillian Mitchell Ac

Stolen Goods.
Locked Up in tho City
Prison on a Serious
Charge.
Gimp Morrisey, a Messenger,
Admits That He Sold the

SAYS THAT HE FOUND IT.
The Detectives Investigating a Mys
terious Burglary In a Cloak
House.
Lillian Mitchell, a rather preposses
sing woman, is locked up In the City
Prison, charged with receiving a valu
able sealskin cape, knowing the same
to have been stolen.
Several days ago the police were no
tified that a sealskin cape had been
stolen from a store on Kearny street.
Detectives Ryan and ODea were de
tailed on the case, and by dint of In
quiry they learned that the stolen gar
ment was In the possession of the
Mitchell woman. When seen by the
detectives the woman at first refused
to say where she got the cape, but
finally admitted that she bouzht it
from a messenger boy who Is known as
"Gimp" Morrisey.
Last night the boy, learning that the
detectives were anxious to see him,
visited police headquarters and ex
plained how he came into possession of
the cape.
According to his ttory. he was walk
ing along Market street several days
ago while delivering a message, when
he picked up the cape, which was lying
on the sidewalk.
"I took it home," he remarked, when
telling the story, "expecting that the
owner would advertise for it and re
ward me for my trouble. I scanned the
newspapers the next day, but as the
loss of the cape was not noted I con
cluded that the owner did not prize it
very highly, and I determined to sell
it. Meeting the Mitchell woman, I of
fered to sell it to her for $5. She gave
me 50 cents, and promised to pay the
balance in a few days.
"A short time afterward she was ar
rested for receiving the cape and
thrown in jail. Knowing the detectives
were searching for me, I concluded to
visit police headquarters and inform
them how I came into possession of the
garment."
While Inclined to believe the boy's
story, the police intend to hold the
woman, pending further investigation.
THREE BULLETS
IN HIS BREAST
The Determined Effort of John

Shot Himself to Death Four Days
Before His Body Was

"With the firm resolve to die and end his

L,uhrs was a German longshoreman.
about 55 years old, and had been rooming
at 10 St. Charles place for the last three
years. Of late he had been sick and de

to his friends that there was nothing left
In life for him. He had not been seen
about the house for three or four days,
and when his room was broken open yeÂ»

The man had been dead three or four
days, but just when he shot himself is

CARING FOR
THE WOUNDED
Menof the Second Brigade
Demonstrate What
They Can Do.
A Practioal Illustration of How
the Sanitary Corps Works
In the Field.
Pive Burgeon* Who Negleotsd to
Show Up at the Drill at Ingle
side to Be Investigated.
Yesterday was field flay for the Sani
tary Corps of the Second Brigade, N. G.
C, and the members of the corps who are
stationed in this city and the contingent
from Oakland were on duty. There were
twenty-six men of the corps, who were
assisted in the performance of the work
they d!d by Company X, First Regiment
Infantry, Captain Cunningham.
There were present of the medical de
partment Colonel \V. E. Hopkins of the
staff of the commander-in-chief, sur
geon-general; Colonel John Galiwey, sur
geon on tho division staff; Lieutenant-
Colonel S. F. Hanson, surgeon on the staff
of the Second Brigade; Major W. D. Mc-
Carthy, surgeon of the First Regiment;
Captains P. J. H. Farrell and Thomas
Rethers, surgeons of the First Infantry,
and Captain T. O. Rottanzi, surgeon of
the Fifth Infantry, also Major Hugh T.
Sime of the Third Battalion of the First
Infantry.
The place first selected In the forenoon
was a piece of wooded ground north of
the Ingleside race track, but it was found
that there was not enough open territory
to allow of the maneuvers that would ;
have to be performed and permission was [
obtained of the Olympic Gun Club to have
the evolutions on the broad field on which
they practice shooting at clay pigeons, lit j
the forenoon live squads of four men each '
from the Sanitary Corps were, by a ser- j
geant, put through the drill with litters, !
which was executed with a great deal of
precision. After lunch provided by the i
commissary department for the men of ;
the two organizations and the officers, i
the camp Which had been established ou j
the site first selected was struck and the i
men, followed by an ambulance, loaned i
by the medical department at the Pro- :
sidio, proceeded to the second site select- j
ed, but there unexpected opposition was
met in the person of President M. C. Al- i
len of the Gun Club, who protested j
against the invasion by the troops.
While the president was arguing with
Major McCarthy, who had charge of the
sanitary corps, some one suggested to j
Captain Cunningham to move his men i
forward, and an order to that effect was
given. The men took up a position 300
yards south of the one at which they had
halted, the sanitary corps followed close j
behind, the ambulance was driven to a :
point still further south, and while the
argument was still in progress me ha,- j
tional Guardsmen had established them
sen es ana dared any one to put them vii.
In the meantime a field hospital tent was
erected in short order, close to where the
ambulance was stationed, another tent
was puT up about seventy-five yards ,
south. The infantrymen were supplied '
with blank cartridges, and fifteen men ;
were selected to be victims for the sani
tary corps 10 worK upon, ,t<acn bad a I
tag. attached to his coat, and on each j
was written the character of the injury
he would receive in battle. This work,
in actual service, is performed by the
surgeon after examination, but the ex
pedient referred to had to.be resorted to.
on account of the absence of five of the !
surgeons. "Within the field tent there was '
a field operating table and a medical and !
surgical chest for the use of the surgeons
on duty there. This is made of bamboo
and iron straps and has on it a litter.
It is so arranged that the litter can' be
removed and a litter with a wounded man
I on it can be put in its place. The opera
tion Utute aiul litter ait- stronger nan
those used in the regulararmy.andthetwo
i together weigh less than an army litter.
This, an idea evolved in the sanitary
corps, has been highly commended by
army officers, as have also the belts with
pucKets in iiu'iii worn by the men, wnion
were also devised in the corps.
A detail or lour men was sent from
Company X to a point several hundred
yards south, to represent four platoons !
of the enemy, and then the other men ;
were divided into three platoons, deployed i
as skirmishers and ordered forward to j
meet the fire of the enemy. A number of j
volleys at various positions were fired, i
but the fire of the enemy had a terrific
effect on the advancing men, for they fell j
on all sides, and then the squads of the
sanitary corps were, called for duty.' In i
each case two comrades of a fallen man
would improvise a stretcher by crossing
belts of their rifles, placing the wounded !
man upon it and carrying him a short
distance to the rear, where they could !
lay him down and allow the sanitary j
squad to take care of him. If the injury ;
marked was a shattered leg and first aid
splints were not serviceable, the men ;
would use two rifles for splints and bind
these in such a manner that the leg could
not be moved. Proper bandages were ap
plied to prevent hemorrhage, and the first
aid having been rendered, the wounded I
man was lifted from the ground by three
men on one side and one on the other;
then the lone man. releasing his ho'ri. |
placed the litter under the patient, he
was laid on it and hurriedly carried to
the first aid hospital, where he was ex- j
amined by the surgeon in charge. If the i
injury required additional dressing it
was attended there, but if not requisite i
the patient was placed in the ambulance
and taken to the field hospital, where
Captain Farrell examined the card and i
instructed those present as to what
should be done to care for the injured in
dividual. The instructions were clear,
comprehensive and easily followed.
Each of the fifteen men had a different
Injury, and in that manner the members j
of the corps had full opportunity to show ;
their skill in temporarily dressing wounds,
and in every instance the work was cor
rectly performed. The exercise the men
had required a great deal of activity, and I
in many instances they had to carry ;
patients more than 300 yards.
The surgeon-general expressed himself
â well pleased with the drill, and stated
that it is his purpose of making the corps
the most efficient branch of the National
Guard. >=;
The five surgeons who were absent are
Captain O'Brien of the First Infantry, !
Captains Dunn and Hammond of the
Fifth Infantry, Captain Somers of the
signal corps and Captain Fitzgibbons of
Troop* A. By their absence they put the
| corps to a great deal of inconvenience
and imposed double duty on those who
were there. Charges of neglect of duty
will be preferred against them by Major
McCarthy, and such will be sent to tho
superior officer under whoso direction
they are, and they will be required to
appear before a board of inquiry to show
cause why they should not be punished
for such neglect.

TO MEN ROB
A YOUNG WOMAN
One of Them Arrested
and the Other Still
at Liberty.
Drink Led Miss Annie B. Kedon
Into a Strange Ad
venture.
Her Escorts Held Her Up While Ac
companying Her to Her Homo
on Hyde Streat.
A daring robbery was committed by
two men upon a young woman at an early
hour yesterday morning on Van Ness
avenue and Market street. One of the
men is under arrest, and detectives are
scouring the city for the other one.
The victim of the robbery is Miss Annie
B. Kedon, 4 Hyde street. Shortly before
2 o'clock yesterday morning Policemen
Harrison and Ward heard a woman's
screams coming from the direction of j
Market and Van Ness, and they both ran
In that direction. They saw Miss Kedon
standing on the sidewalk and declaring
that she had been robbed. She pointed
to a man who was running along Oak
Street as one of the men who robbed
her. They gave chase, and after running
three or four blocks they shouted that if
the fugitive did not stop they would use
their revolvers. He continued his flight,
and Harrison threw his club at him and
hit him on the back. This had the ef
fect of bringing him to a stop, and he
was quickly handcuffed and taken back
to Miss Kedon. The officers went with
their prisoner and Miss Kedon to Cap
tain Spillane, and abe told her story.
She said she met W. H. Whipple, an
acquaintance, at Golden Gate avenue and
Hyde streets about 9 o'clock Saturday
night, and they had a walk, stopping at
MoCormick's grocery store, on Market
and Fell streets, where they had a few
drinks.
After leaving there they went to a
saloon on the corner of Market and
Cough streets, where they had several
other drinks, and she was introduced to
J. W. Turton. the man arrested. Accom
panied by Whipple and Turton she left
the saloon to go home, between 1 and 2
o'clock, and when they reached Market
street and Van Ness avenue, Tur
ton, Fhe said, forcibly took from
the breast of her dress a purse
containing $60, a small purse containing
25 cents and her silver w T atch. Then she
screamed, and Whipple and Turton ran
away. She also had her bank book in
the breast of her dress and an important ;
letter. The bank book was not touched,
but the letter was stolen. She refused to
give any information as to the contents
of the letter.
The police found the small purse con
taining 25 cents, but the purse with thÂ«
$60, the watch and the letter are still
mlgalny. and the supposition is that
Whipple has them. The small purse had
been thrown away.
Turton is employed at the Union Iron
Works, and WhipplP is a waiter in the
Union Hotel, on Turk and Webster
streets. Turton was booked on a charge
of robbery.
Miss Kedon'a father for years kept a
hardware store on Clay street, between
Davis and East streets, and when he died
be left a comfortable estate for his two
children, a son and daughter. The son ;
was killed a few years ago.

SAN JOSE'S DOG SHOW.
Hundreds of Aristocratic Canines
Will Be Exhibited.
SAN JOSE, March 27.â Hundreds of '
aristocratic canines will hold a grand j
pow-wow at the kennel show of the Santa j
Clara Valley Poultry and Kennel Club, ;
which opens at Turn Vereln Hall next ;
Wednesday. Prize-winners from all over j
the coast have been entered, and the ag
gregation will be the finest exhibit' of ;
thoroughbred dogs ever made in the j
West. Fanciers from different points
will be present.
Professor Martin's troop of trained dogs
will give a performance every afternoon 'â 
and evening. Among these are the dogs i
Corbett and Fitzsimmons, who appear in
a boxing contest. This attraction has |
been added for the benefit of children and |
others not interested in thoroughbreds.
The benching of the show this year
will be superior to that generally used at 1
doi? shows. Spr.itt's patent kennels have j
been secured. These are of wire with no
sides to obstruct the view. J. C. Berret i
will have charge of the animals, and
shippers from afar need have no fear of
their dogs not receiving the best of care.
C. D. Navin, the noted dog-fancier of
P.allston, Or., will judge all classes. The
judging will begin at the opening of the
show und continue until all the dogs have
been tagged.
A feature of the show will be the fine
display of Scotch collies. Those have

THE ILLS OF WOMM
And How Mrs. Pinkham Helps
Overcome Them.
Mrs. Mary Boixix ger, 1101 Marianna
St., Chicago, 111., to Mrs. Pinkham:
"I have been troubled for the past
two years with falling of the womb,
leucorrhoea, pains over my body, sick
headaches, backache, nervousness and
weakness. I tried doctors and various
remedies without relief. After taking
two bottles of your Vegetable Com-
pound, the relief I obtained was truly
j wonderful. I have now taken several
I more bottles of your famous medicine,
; and can say that I am entirely cured.'*
Mrs. llexey Dorr, No. 806 Findley St.,
; Cincinnati, Ohio, to Mrs. Pinkham :
" For a long time I suffered with
chronic inflammation of the womb,
pain in abdomen and bearing-down,
feeling. Was very nervous at times, and
so weak I was hardly able to do any-
thing. Was subject to headaches, also
troubled with leucorrhaea. After doc-
toring for many months with different
physicians, and getting no relief, I had
given up all hope of being well
again when I read of the great good
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound was doing. I decided immedi-
ately to give it a trial. The result was
simply pastr belief. After taking four
bottles of Vegetable Compound and
using three packages of Sanative Wash
I can say I feel like a new woman. I
deem it my duty to announce the fact
to my fellow sufferers that Lydia
E. Pinkham's Vegetable remedies have
entirely cured me of all my pains and
suffering. I have her alone to thank
for my recovery, for which I am grate-
ful. May heaven bless her for tho
good work she is doing for our sex."

times party" in Washington Hall. There

of dances that ha- been prepared by
Mesdames BlarUall, Trenell, Waldo, Gin
gles and Howard, and Misses Poetz and

party," the many handsome costumes
that were worn "by those in character,

The French Benevolent
Society Elects Men to
Control Its Affairs.
A. Heated Discussion as to the
Method of Casting the
Ballots.
The Faction Known Â«c the Parisians
Wins and All Difference*
Are Settled.
There was enough excitement In Na
tive Sons' Hall yesterday to satisfy the
most emotional members of the French
colony. It occurred during the an
nual election of the French Mutual
Benefit Society, and was owing to a
dispute as to what was the proper way I
to conduct the balloting. One faction, !
known as the Parisians, strongly con
tended that the only way was to give
the ballot to the members as they en
tered the voting booths, whereas the
opposition, known as the Bernals, in
sisted that the ballots should be dis- j
trlbuted in the hall to the members so |
that they could mark and deposit them j
as they pleased.
During the argument over the nu
merous motions made by excited par
ticipants, the Bemais opposition de
veloped a strong leader in J. A. Berge
rot, who in his enthusiasm overstepped
the bonds of his side and was deserted
by his own people. Bergerot mounted
the platform and made a stirring
speech, advocating the distribution of
the ballots so that the members could
mark them wit' >ut intimidation. Los
ing control of himself, he launched
forth a tirade of abuse against his op
ponents, during which he was hissed
and interrupted. In the midst of his
speech he jumped from the platform,
and. running to where the sealed bun
dle containing the ballots was, he
broke it open, and grabbing a hand
ful, he again took his stand on the
stage and continued his heated re
marks.
A stout gentleman belonging to the
Parisian contingent took umbrage at
the remarks of Mr. Bergerot, and,
mounting the platform, joined the de
bate. By this time it looked as if Bed
lam had broken loose. Excited mem
bers were on their feet expostulating,
cheering, hissing and yelling in an ef
fort to quiet Mr. Bergerot. They might
not fcave succeeded had not the Ber
nais tiement, becoming tired of their
leader's stand. Joined in the hissing
and general racket. Seeing himself
deserted the little man grabbed his
coat and hat, and after delivering a
parting shot, emphasized with a shake
of the fist, retired with colors flying.
Matters then quieted down and Vice-
President Cames had an opportunity
to place the questions before the body
for a direct vote. It was then decided
that the ballots should be given the
voters as they entered the booth. From
2:30 until 6 o'clock the polls were open,
and during that time 85s ballots were
cast.
Twenty-eight candidates for the gen
eral committee were on the ballot, of
which fifteen were to be elected. As
the destiny of this important society
â¢was placed in their hands it was deem
ed a great honor to be elected.
Henry S. Martin led the van with a
vote of 510, and was closely followed
by the following gentlemen, who were
elected to the important office: J. Jul
lien, 498; E. Servea'u, 474; A. Legallet,
469; J. M. Dupas, 459; P. Cames, 452;
J. Bergez, 445; L. Bocqueraz, 444; B.
Reiss, 443; J. Desberats, 43G; R. Chart
rey, 405; J. Bernou, 403; Thomas La
coste, 394; H. Fabregue, 381, and F.
Queyrel, 372.
The unelected candidates received
votes as follows: M. J. Bayle, 368;
P. A. Bergerot, 366; Pierre Berges, 361;
J. B. Lacaze, 355; B. Sarthou. 348; G.
Pouchan, 344; A. Miqueu, 343; J. B.
Minvielle, 343; J. Loustale, 327; E. tf.
Dupuy, 322; J. B. Pon, 306; E. A. Le
moine, 287.
The vote on physicians recommended
to the board of fifteen for election was
as follows: For visiting physician, Dr.
E. de Corval; for superintending phy
sician of the French Hospital, Dr. De
Chantreau; for surgeon, Dr. De Mar
ville; for occullst and aurist, Dr. Kas
per Pischel.
The following committee had charge
of the voting booths: A. Lavengnes, D.
C. Dabin, L. Carraine, A. Bousquet and
P. Fontaine.

CHINATOWN HELD A PICNIC.
The Site of Their New Cemeterg in San Mateo Countu the Place
of Festivitu.
Did you ever hear of a Chinese picnic?
This question can be readily answered
by glancing over the history of the Chi
nese colony In this ciiy, one of the larg
est, if not the largest, in America. .Fast
history will answer no, but the history
of the future will record in its annals one
of the most novel events of the present
yearâ a real, genuine summer outing of
the Chinese population of Frisco.
The email boy was more than in his
element yesterday afternoon; the curious
ar.d the inquisitive, and those thirsting
for the unusual, had a treat which,
In Its novelty, has never before been
equaled in a civilized community.
The forty acres of ground which were
bought in San Mateo County some weeks
ago by the Nlng Yun Association and set
apart by its members as the "God's
Acre" of the Chinese, or, more strictly
speaking, the resting place for their de
ceased brethren, was formally dedicated
yesterday afternoon.
The dedication ceremony differed ma
terially from that which Caucasians are
usually in the habit of conforming to in
a solemnity of this character, and, in
stead of sacred prayers and weird chant,
our heathen brother ate rice and made
merry.
This eating of rice and making merry
in American phraseo:ogy would be con
tracted in the one word picnic, for in all
respects the two are synonymous, if nc-t
Identical.
In order to defray the necessary ex
pense of placing the affair on the desired
scale of sumptuosity, according to Chi
nese taste, each Ning.Yun has been taxed
$2 as his contribution toward the success
of the affair.

THE DAY AT THE CHURCHES.
OUR ALLIES IN THE FIGHT.
"Our Allies in the Fight" was the sub
ject of Rev. Dr. HemphiU's address last
night at the Calvary Presbyterian
Church. The text of the address was
taken from the Fifty-fifth Psalm, in
which David tells of his victory over his
enemies. It was at a time when David
thought himself unbefriended and did
not expect any to be on his side, when
suddenly he heard the tramp of an army,
and he breaks forth with the utterance
of glad surprise, "there were many with
me!"
"Do we, as Christians, stand on the
side of right? If we do, who stand with
us? The Supreme Power of the Universe
is with us, and one with God is a major
ity.
"Did the Spanish Government blow up
out battleship and our brave boys In
blue? If she did she may squirm and
play for delay, but the United States
(lovernment will not suffer her brave
boys to be blown to atoms to make a
Spanish holiday. The United States
Government will protect her citizens and
soldiers and punish those who outrage
them. If we are lighting for the right we
have God's angels on our side and they
tell for many. They turn seeming minor
ities into real majorities. When conflicts
deepen on earth other worlds send hosts
of eager combatants to the fray. Hell
will do its worst to ruin us; but be com
forted, heaven will do its best to save us.
The Kingdom of Righteousness is the
most powerful kingdom in the universe,
arid none may outrage a citizen of that
kingdom with impunity. The world is on
our side. The system of nature has never
been false to the right. The ordinances
and means of grace are on our side.
They who stand on our side tell for
many. The forces which are leagued
against us are not the master forces of
the universe. The master forces are on
our side, and if we give them full play
nothing can withstand us. When word
was brought to Plymouth that the Span
ish armada was in sight Admiral Sir
Francis Drake was playing a game of
skittles, and the great naval hero insist
ed on finishing the game, saying 'There
will be plenty of time then to beat the
Spaniard." A man of that mettle was
very likely to beat the Spaniard. There
is another Spanish armada rushing
across the Atlantic at present, but
we are not afraid. We have a
few American heroes who can play a
game of skittles and whip the Spaniard
In the bargain. And it is time to whip
the Spaniard. Not because of the blow
ing up of the battleship and the boys in
blue. We have to prove that yet, but be
cause of Spain's inhumanity to Cuba and
the Cubans. In the name of humanity
let the inhumanity cease. We do not
want war, but we want the bloody inhu
manity to stop, and It must stop. Spain
has always been Inhuman. We are cot
THE SAN FRANCESCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 28, 1898.
Chinatown cook shops as a natural con
sequenoe of this sudden flow of wealth
have been in operation night and day pre
paring, flavoring, browning and toasting
savory geese, palatable chickens and
grease-bespattered hogs, and, in short,
every possible de.icacy that may tend to
tickle the epicurean palate of the Orien
tal.
Innocent and snow-white lambs, with
red. white and blue tails, and ears to
match, were there to add a tinge of
relish to the general feast and watch over
the festal board with their staring life
less eyes.
These good things constituted the
main feast, but not all by any means, for
a banquet is not a banquet without des
sert. To supply this need there were
watermelon seeds, both black and
pink, candy, from a Chinese standpoint
perfection itself, and an occasional indi
gestible "China clam."
An immense marble slab, with the
Chinese inscription denoting rwssession,
and certifying that they obtained the
ground by rightful grant, will be sent to
the new cemetery next Saturday morning
and win be in readiness to sink into the
ground the following day as a mark of
possession. To the sides of this slab are
to be placed two additional sections of
marble, drilled wit-, rmumerable holes,
bo as to accommodate the Insertion of
the necessary number of punks, which,
according to Chinese tradition, in an af
fair of this kind are absolutely necessary
to assure success and ward off all possi
ble evil.
Although the Chinese race is Inclined
to adopt American customs to some ex
tent, it hasn't as yet reached that stage
going to get excited over Spain. We, as
'Americans, are slow to act in such emer
gencies, but we are slowly asserting our
selves in the cause of right, and when we
move in that direction we move with a
tremendous force. Let there be no flurry
and no despair, only the calm confidence
which is the herald and harbinger of vic
tory. If God be for us who can be
against us?"
HEROIC SELF-SACRIFICE.
"Christian Missionaries" was the sub
ject of the address given by Rev. John
Stephens at the Simpson Memorial Meth
odist Episcopal Church last night.
"The words of the text," he said, "fur
nish the most startling romance of the
nineteenth century; the facts of its hi*
tory are stranger than fiction; the power
of Christ over men was never more glo
riously exemplified than in missionary ef
fort. We see the workings of an over
ruling providence subduing the rebellious
kingdoms of the earth, and God has
caused the wrath of men to praise him.
"The story of the occupation of Tur
key, Siam, China and Japan is a marvel
ous narrative of the operation of divine
grace, the missionaries themselves ex
hibit the fairest typos of Christian chai
acter that the century has produced, in
their heroic self-secriflce; the work of
such men as McKay, Livingston and Mof
fett have been uncqualed in the world.
'The power of the gospel is wonderfully
illustrated in the conquests that have
been made over heathen depravity; mira.
cles have been wrought in the transfor
mations of degraded natures.
"Stanley has written of the astonishing
success of missionaries in Uganda which
has 120.000, where Stanley found scarcely
one Christian twenty years ago."
MISSIONARY ENTERPRISE.
At the Howard-street Methodist Epis
copal Church at 11 a. m. the pastor
preached on the threefold mission of
Christ, the church and the individual to
save the world, from Luke xxiv:26-27.
"Thus it is written, and thus it behooved
Christ to suffer, to rise again on the
third day, that repentance and remission
of sins might be preached in his name
among all nations, beginning at Jerusa
lem." The sermon was on Christian
missions, and he said in part: The ob
jection is made that the results of for
eign missionary work- are so inadequate.
Let us see. The most successful Christian
organization on this continent has been
Methodism, which from 176 Cto 18:<7 has
developed an actual membership of
5.500,00u and a constituency of 25,000,000.
The Methodist Episcopal church entered
China in IS4S, and was there ten years be
fore a single convert was made. We have
now a membership of 20,000 as the result
of thirty-nine years' work, but it took
our Methodist fathers twenty years to

acute foresight, the result of which is
manifested in the light, airy and sum
mery costume of the summer girl, so
appropriate for picnics.
The belles of "Fish alley" and the
"upper ten" of Waverly place were
seen at their best in variegated "pants"
this season In the gToves of San Mateo
County, but it is hoped that they will
cultivate their imitative faculty suffi
ciently during the next year to provide
an outing garment that will lead to some
clew to the possible distinction between
Mary and John.
The Six Companies have purchased 4000
trees from a gardener in Redwood City
at the rate of 5^ cents apiece, which
will be planted in their new cemetery
directly opposite Holy Cross. The trees
are a year old, and stand two feet aDove
the ground. Planting 1 will commence Im
mediately. A fence is to be erected round
the entire area of the burial place and
an enormous gate is to be placed
directly In front of the by-path leading
from the main road, and will afford the
only means of ingress and egTess.
The ground has been apportioned into
b!x distinct uivisions, one for each of
the six companies. Altars are also to
be erected and will occupy positions im
mediately in front of each separate bur
ial ground.
An enormous marble slab similar to
that to be used by the Ning Yun Asso
ciation is to be placed directly inside the
main gateway, and, like that of the Yun
Company, will be erected as a mark of
possession. The slab used for holding the
sacred punk will also be arranged simi
larly to that of the Yuns.

To do half as well in heathen non-pro
gressive China does not speak so badly
for results.
We entered India in 1557, but because of
the Sepoy rebellion our work scarcely
began until 1869. In these thirty-nine
years we have won a membership in
India of SI.OOO. It took thirty-six years to
do as well in America.
In Japan we have been laboring twenty
five years and number 4722. It took ten
years to win as many in America.
In ten years in Korea we have won to
Christ 1372. And we were seven years in
converting as many to Methodism in
America. Remember that our first con
vert from heathenism in Asia was made
in 1858, just thirty-nine years ago. and
that we now number of converts from
Asiatic heathenism and Mohammedism
106,592, and It took thirty-seven years in
America from the introduction of Meth
odism to win as many, leaving heatnen
Asia but two years behind. Methodism
has to-day in foreign countries as a
product of her missionary enterprises
165.000 converts, and it took us from 1766
to ISIO to win as many at h<>me.
William Carey began the Baptist mis
sions In Burmah in ISI4. Fifty-six years
later they numbered lOu.OOO converts, and
in our own work at home it took thirty
six years to win an equal number.
Captain Cook discovered the Sandwich
Islands about the time that the authori
ties in France were proclaiming that
there was no God. Fifty years later theso
islands were wholly Christianized and
taken from the list of missions, and be
came themselves liberal contributors to
missions. In 1*72. when the descendants
of these French atheists wore starving
from the effects of the German siege of
Paris, the children of the cannibals dis
covered by Captain Cook raised, and for
warded $2000 to relieve their sufferings.
The net profit of the commerce of the
T'nited States with the Sandwich Islands
amounts to a larper .^im than the whole
Christian world expanded for their con
version in fifty years. Now. tell me if
the results of missionary enterprise are
inadequate? And besides all this the
word of Christ Is that his word shall be
preached amonp all nations, beginning
with the worst and most hardened.
REV. DR. LOCKE ON GLAD
STONE.
The Christian manliness of England's
Grand Old Man was the subject selected
by Dr. C. E. L,ocke of the Central Meth
odist Church on Mission Street last
night. The preat statesman, who is
now hoveriner between life and death at
his home In Ilawarden was compared aÂ»
second to none living- to-dny In his match
less championship for the rights and
equalities of. not only the English people,
but also of the entire human race. Glad-
Stone has done mure to prepare England
for a republican form of government than
all other men put together of the present
century. His manliness and his Chris
tian character went hand in hand all
through his eventful career. His defense
of the divinity of Christ against the on
slaughts of such a man as Ingersoll
proved to the thinking and reading world
that he was an exceptionally brilliant
man, and withal a sound believer in the
divinity of Christ.
NECESSITY OF REPENT
ANCE.
The mission which will be held at St.
Mary's Cathedral during this week was
commenced yesterday morning with sol
emn services. A solemn high mass was
celebrated at 11 o'clock, and a sermon on
the subject of the "Objects of the Mis
sion" was delivered by his grace Arch
bishop Riordan. The Rev. Father Hanni
gan acted as celebrant of mass, assisted
by Father C. A. Ramm as deacon, Father
Dempsey as sub-deacon and Father
Yorke as master of ceremonies.
Archbishop Riordan, in expounding the
subject of his address, brought out in
prominence and emphasized the necessity
of repentance as a means of redemption.
"The objects of the mission," he said,
"are to bring the indifferent and stray
sheep to repentance, and by cleansing
their souls bring them nearer to God.
The mission is to instruct and point out
the necessity of a thorough hatred of sin
as a means to eternal happiness." The
preacher cited various characters of the
Bible and spoke of the mission as highly
essential both fur the good and bad, and
not merely for the sinful, as many think.
At the conclusion of mass benediction
of the blessed sa'-rament was solemnized,
being said by the Archbishop, assisted by
the various priests.
The mission will close at vespers next
Sunday evening. During the week masses
will be said daily at 5:45, 7 and 9 o'clock.
A short instruction win be given at early
mas"s and a sermon at 9 o'clock. Rosary,
benediction and a special sermon by Fath
er Yorke will be given every evening.
Confessions will be held at all hours
Thursday, Friday and Saturday.
THE CALVARIAN SOCIETY.
The usual Lenten exercises of the Cal
varian Society were solemnly observed
at the cathedral yesterday afternoon.
Father Rarara delivered an eloquent ser
mon, taking for his text "God's Mercy."
The stations of the cross were said by
Father E. P. Dempsey; singing of the
Stabat Mater by the entire congregation
followed. Benediction was solemnized by
Father Ramm, assisted by Father Demp
sey.
LENTEN SERVICES.
The usual Lenten services were observed
by the cadets of the League of the Cross
in the various parishes throughout the
city yesterday afternoon. At St. Peters'
Church, in the Mission, the entire regi
ment in that parish attended service In
full uniform, the officers bearing the full
regimentals of the League. The churcn
was crowded by both young people and
old, and many of the hymns were sung
by the congregation as well as by the c&*
dets.
SERMON BY REV. FATHER
YORKE.
"What doth it profit a man if he gain
the whole world and suffer the loss of his
own soul?" was the subject of the first ol
a series of six sermons which will be dÂ»
llvered by Father Yorke every evening of
the present week, and was delivered at
the cathedral last evening. The sermon
consisted of an expansion of the above
text, and was given for the purpose of
tracing man's duty towards God, and the
strict adherence to religious duty as the
only possible means of salvation and eter
nal happiness.
"We should strive after the happiness
that toucheth the soul and not that which
toucheth the body," said the preacher;
"to save our souls we must remember
that it is an individual duty that efceta
man must do for himself. What are the
glories of the world compared to those
above? Our minds should not be filled
with thoughts of the world, but w*
should consider where we came from and
whither we are going. God did not make
us for the world; he made us for him
self and placed us in the world in order
to fit ourselves to live with him everlast
ingly in the world to come, God put us
into the world and gave us life, and with
it the exercise of free will; but this soul
that he has breathed into our bodies can
not be saved by him, but must be done
so by our efforts alone."
"OUR SPANISH RELATIONS"
"Our Spanish Relations" was the sub
ject of an address delivered last evening
by Rev. W. E. Dugan at the Stewart
Memorial Presbyterian Church. In part
he said:
"Our relations with Spain are becoming
more and more critical. The Maine dis
aster was a terrible thing. But the cruel
ties of Spain as practiced upon the peo
ple of Cuba are atrocious beyond all idea.
The people are slowly but surely being
butchered through the process of starva
tion. Grim war is a dreadful thing but
inviting as compared to the crude sav
agery going on down in Cuba. Oh, God,
has the world swung back to heathenism
and the cruelties of despotic darkness?
Is the vile heart of Nero resurrected and
throbbing in the breast of the Spanish
nation today?
"Senator Thurston said in his speech on
the Cuban situation, 'Spain has set up
more crosses in more lands and under
them butchered more people than all
other nations of the globe combined.'
That butchery to-day is taking on a most
tyrannical and oppressive nature, and
shall we, the liberty-loving people of the
United States, tolerate it longer? Above
all, shall we, the followers of Jesus
Christ, stand indifferent while our broth
ers cringe in the cruel agonies of a death
of slow starvation? Peter brought the
power of oGd through his helping hand
and sympathetic heart to the poor crip
ple at the beautiful gate. Our brothers
in Cuba are in a more critical condition
than was that crippled beggar. The na
tions of the earth look on in cold in
difference. Let us, as the successors of
Peter and followers of Christ, demand our
own government to interfere and put an
end to things that are a disgrace to civ
ilization. When strong-hearted Senators
break down and weep lik^ babies as they
did when Thurston set before them the
awful atrocities, we may be sure that the
situation is most critical, and the poor
starving natives deserve the sympathy
and help of the people of civilization. In
the name of God let us give them all
neededhelpâ firearms, if needed."
MURDERED IN
A BASEMENT
The Body of -Charles Gates, a

WELL PLEASED
Mongols Extend Profes
sional Courtesy to
Miss Held.
Midst Smell and Smoke a
Party of Theatrical People
See Chinatown.
The Guide Trie* to Explain Loca
Politics to a Frenchwoman
and. Faints.
Anna Held, the little French woman,
who has danced her way Into the
hearts of half the gay people on the
American continent, made her first ap
pearance on the San Francisco stage
last evening. Unfortunately she did not
do her regular specialty, but, for the
nonce, played the part of a spectator,
and consequently the large audience,
comprising Chinatown's four hundred,
who had gathered to see the ninety
seventh act of the latest Peking suc
cess, "The Green Dragon and the Yel
low Dog," missed the treat that their
white brethren will enjoy at the Bald
win this evening.
Miss Held is an inquisitive little bit
of Parisian femininity and the minute
her car rolls into a city she starts out
to see all of the place that is worth
looking at, in which laudable endeavor
every minute of her time, when she is
not on the stage, is employed. Yester
day she organized a party â¢to go
through Chinatown, after the fair Anna
herself had slept off the fatigue of an
afternoon ride to the Cliff, where she
had been to loo^c at "ze leetle zeel
skins."
Miss Held was awakened from her
slumbers in her private car, and going
into her boudoir emerged in a few
minutes clothed in a light brown street
dress and ready for her visit to the
haunts of the descendants of the Tartar
kings. So the whole party, consisting
of Miss Held herself, George Bowles,
her manager, F. Ziegfeld Jr. and
Charles Hanlon, the lawyer, who was
there as a guest of Mr. Bovles, started
off on their tour.
"Ees it not droll, ze musik, and ze
szmell, mais, but zat ees not zo droll
as ze odder," was the comprehensive
and critical remark that the Chinese
theater provoked as the party passed
through the doors and, forcing its way
through crowds of unwashed Cantonese
that lined the walls and blocked the
passage ways, took their places in a
stage box that had been decorated by
the management with a brand new
American flag in honor of the distin
guished professional visitor. Miss Held
sat and gazed at the stage with interest
while the audience of males in the pit
sat and "rubber-necked" at her heed
ful of the furious glances sent to them
by their jealous better-halves who were
seated in the women's gallery. The
men had not^seen anyone so attractive
as this girl #om across the water for
many a long day and resolved to have
all the fun they could out of the sight
while it lasted even though it meant a
hot time when they retired for the
night behind the dorflestic privacy of
their fireside mattings.
From the theater the party went
through opium dens, where the drowsy
devotes of the poppy awoke from their
dreams long enough to strike for a
dime and immediately relapsed into
their state of coma, through alleys
where ladies of no especial reputation
peeped at it from out strange little
barred windows and passed remarks
which were fortunately not understood;
to tea houses where Miss Held ate
French bon-bons and refused tea: to
Murderer's alley, where her disappoint
ment had been assuaged by the expla
nation that only the early morn
ing hours were devoted to kill
ing, owing to a superstition that it
was unlucy to get a shot or a stab
in the dark; to the Grand Hotel, where
the leper exhibited his shrunken limbs
and told about the time he used to do
politics for Dr. ODonnell, and where
the guide tried to explain to Miss Held
what politics meant, and was resusci
tated with difficulty; to a drug store
where perfume was purchased to kill
the odor of the opium joints, and where
the party hurried into the open air
trying to get rid of the perfume, and in
each place Miss Held would turn to the
person nearest to her and ask ques
tions in a mixture of French and Eng
lish which wera Â«-nly exceeded in their
unintelligibllity by the answers re
ceived.
The last place visited was a Chinese
pawnshop, whre Mr. Bowles seemed to
be perfectly at home and instinctively
reached for his watch, but recollecting
himself asked the Chinese behind the
counter what he would loan on the girl
and was promptly offered $500, with 5
per cent off, as the feet did not come up
to the Oriental standard.
As the party turned from Chinatown
proper into the environs on the t*ay
home Miss Held was heard to inquire
confidentially of the guide as to the
identity of "ze Mlstair Ah Zeed," who
she had heard was "ze fren of Mlstair
Billee Emerson, who maik ze pairsons
laugh."

of the adm ssion of California Into
the Union will be celebrated in a
â way that will cause the memory
c Mldwin-er Fair to grow dim in
the mind of "Id and young. This
younger child of the popular fancy 1b
to be carried 'Ut on so vast a plan that
its predecessor will pale into insignifi
cance. That this is not mere talk is
shown by the fact that as each step is
taken toward securing the exposition
the enthusMsm grows in proportion
Not only i.< there ample time in which
to make pans and carry them out on
a grand s ale, but the men selected by
Mayor Phelan to do this form one of
the best bodies for that purpose that
could be found, the name of every man
being prima facie evidence that the
branch assigned to him will receive the
most careful consideration.
The time is too early for any plans
to be made known as yet, on account of
the fa t that premature publication, in
the oj inion of the committee, would do
more harm than good. That they will
do h nor to the originators the person
nel of the committee is a sufficient
guarantee.
"I think the suggestion of The Call
la excellent," said Supervisor Clinton
yesterday, "and that paper deserves
much credit for the manner in which it
has proceeded to urge the idea of a cel
ebration. It is not only fitting that we
should celebrate the fiftieth anniver
sary of the admission of the State into
the Union, but it will be found in the
long run a profitable undertaking. I
believe the matter will be safe in the
hands of the men his Honor the Mayor
has selected to act on the committee;
they are all men of experience, and men
who have shown in the past that they
take a Justifiable pride in doing all they
can for the advancement of the State.
Looking at the matter from a patriotic
standpoint, here is an excellent chance
for us to shine."
The vitlcultural branch of the cele
bration will rest in the hands of Charles
Bundschu, whose work in behalf of the
public as a director of the Merchants"
Association is a matter of record. He
is warm in his praise of the idea of a
grand exposition and will do all in his
power to advance viticultural interests
when the time for action comes.
"In my opinion," he stated yester
day, "this fair will mean much for the
State. We can make a magnificent
Buccess of it on account of the Â«xperi
ence gained during the time of the Mid
winter Fair. I shall do my utmost to
see that all the viticultural countries
are represented. My heart goes with
this movement. The Call has proved
by the capable manner in which it has
managed this affair so far that it is a
good leader for the people to stand be
hind and fight their way to recognition
in the business marts of the world."
Not only is the committee enthusias
tic over the prospects, but the support
it will receive ought to revive even a
faint heart and flagging footsteps. The
support of several of the States of the
great West has been promised already,
and the others will doubtless fall into
line wjien called upon. California is
a unit on the proposition. The trend
of opinion throughout the State on
the subject is so well shown by inter
views with the mayors of the various
cilies and towns, many of which have
b^en published. Others are given in \
this Issue. It will be a.n enormous un
dertaking, but the fruits will be rich
reward for the labor.

ALL GOTHAM WOULD
GAZE AND WONDER.
Some Ideas on Amusement Features Con
tributed by Manager S. H.
Friedlander.
Perhaps it might be deemed too early yet to say anything
about the plans of the proposed semi-centennial celebration, but this
can hardly be said of generalities. Publication of the fact that we
are going to have features of vast interest in the various branches
can do nothing but awaken enthusiasm in the public mind. To me
has been accorded the handling of the amusement branch of the un
dertaking, and I make bold to say that it shall be the effort of my
life to give the people features of interest never seen in the State
before â I might safely say that many of them have never been on
this side of the Atlantic. And all this is to be taken as entirely ex
clusive of the theaters, all to be outdoor amusements. From Paris di
rect will come some ideas on parades that would make even the
Gothamites open their eyes. Many of these amusement features had
been prepared for the proposed Golden Jubilee, and they will come
in handy enough now. â S. H. Friedlander in an interview.
TULARE WILL CHEERFULLY ASSIST
The Exposition Should Be Made One of the Most
Imposing Events of the Century.
TULARE, March 26.â D. J. F. Reed, Mayor of Tulare, was asked for an
expression of his views In regard to the semi-centennial exposition to be held
in 1900. Mayor Reed is one of those
progressive, liberal, energetic and
level-headed officials whose Influence
in a community is easily recognized.
He is a prosperous stock dealer and
fruit farmer, and has done valiant ser
vice for Tulare in procuring right-of
way in this district for the Valley
Road.
Said he: Let me assure you that
am heartily glad to express my sent
ments upon this matter through th
medium of The Call. For clean jour
nalism and abundant enterprise com
mend me to The Call. I cheerfully In
dorse the suggestion for an expositio
In 1900 on the lines suggested by Th
Call, and feel sure that Tulare will ren
der any and every assistance to insur
the success of the proposed celebra
tlon. It should be an exposition worthy
of the great State of California, and
should Include not only California, but
the entire Pacific Coast. Our combined efforts should be able to make It one
of the most imposing events of the century, for nowhere on earth is a more
delightful dim- where the resources are so rich as in our Golden State. The
manifold advantages of a home in California are so numerous as to require
but an enumeration to impress upon the minds of our visitors from the
East the fact that here is the most favored spot upon the globe.
Thousands within the next decade will seek and create homes In Califor
nia, and many of these will be induced to come by the aid of a judicious pre
sentation of our varied advantages, which can be done so successfully by
the proposed exposition.
Exhibits and expositions which demonstrate the rapid steps of our ma
terial progress are among the most potent of advertisements and are far
reaching in effect.
Thousands â¢would visit the State at that time, who would receive an ob
ject lesson, and many would become residents and others missionaries for our
Golden State. Of course I would favor holding the exposition in Tulare, the
railroad center of the San Joaquin Valley. You can quote me as enthusi
astically in favor of the exposition, and anxious to aid in any way possible.

The Sectional Line to Be
Obliterated If That Is
Possible.
Captain Perkins' Signal Corps
Is the Crackerjack of the
Local Guard.
Review of the Inspections in This
City â The Cadet C->rps Has
Redeemed Itself.
Major-General Dickinson returned to
this city last week and discussed a plan
to go south, intending to leave here on the
7th of May and be present during the in
spection of companies of the Third Brig
ade and those of the First Brigade and
the inspection of the naval divisions at
the several points on the southern coast.
One purpose of his presence In that seu
tion is to use his influence to erase the
sectional line north and south of the Te
hachapi which has had much to do in
past years in preventing the Guard of this
I State from being a unit. Upon this visit
he will be accompanied by as many of his
staff as can accompany him, and It Is
i probable that Colonel James F. Smith of
the First Infantry will meet him In San
Diego on the 16th of May, when the divi
sion of the naval militia will be inspect
ed and there Is to be a cruise on the Pin
ta.
The vacancy on the division staff caused
by the acceptance of the resignation of j.
Alva Watt, judge-advocate, has not yet
been filled, but the position has been ten
dered to J. J. Dwyer, a well-known at
torney of this city. He was formerly a
member of the old Third Regiment.
The uniform board met on Saturday
and opened bids for caps, but owing to
some informality in the matter of pre
senting the figures by one biddar decision
was reserved until to-morrow. The bids
range from 82 cents and a fraction to $1 25
for each cap. *_*_.Â«
Six separate demands for cadet rifles
for the cadet corps have been made, but
in each case no heed has been paid to
these requests.
By general orders from general head
quarters Frank de L. Carrington, caiÂ»
tain U. S. A., inspector of the N. G. 0.,
will act in conjunction with each brigade
inspector and examine all unserviceable
ordnance, quartermaster's stores, uni
forms etc. He is appointed a board of
survey and will report recommendations
as to such disposition as will be for the
best interest of the State.
The same orders permit the use of
stamps or fac-similes of signatures to be
used in forwarding or transmitting all
papers which do not require the personal
action or approval of the officer on thtÂ»
contents It also directs that the saddle
cloths for the staff corps shall be dark
blue with an edging of gold lace one inch
wide' in the corner shall be the insignia
as prescribed for the collar of the officer'!,
undress coat, omitting the letters N. G.
C â  for all other officers the cloth shall b*
of the same color with the number of the
regiment in enamel leather figures two
and one-half inches long, on each flank
corner, the edge to be trimmed with
enamel leather, edge and figures to be of
the color of the respective arm of the
service to which the officer belongs.
THE LOCAL INSPECTIONS.

IS FEASIBLE AND PRACTICABLE.
Next Legislature Should Make Suitable Financial
Provision for the Event.
STOCKTON, March 26.â Mayor Inglis approves of The Call's suggestions
concerning the semi-centennial exposition most he rtlly.
Â«<t jÂ« -nn* coo iinnr nir Invn.l f!a!lfor-
Coast will reap a thousand fold blessing in the new capital and high
class immigration which will be attracted to our midst. By that time the
Valley road will have reached San Francisco, our rivers and harbors will
have been improved and a hundred other great developments made which are
now planned. San Francisco is the natural location for such an event, and
not only the Pacific Coast but the entire inter-mountain country should join
hands and begin working at once for the success of the exposition. Work is
what tells a d there is no better time to begin than now. I believe that the
coming Legislature should make suitable financial recognition of the coming
event and the matter should be put in presentable shape at once and a defi
nite plan of work be outlined. Of course many of our municipal and county
bodies will change hands before then, but the ground work can be laid.
"There is one matter I would urge upon the interior of the State, and that
is that petty jealousies of the State's metropolis should be laid aside. San
Francisco is not California, nor California San Francisco, and those who
. ppk to alienate the interior from supporting the enterprising people of that
rftv are no friends of the State. San Joaquin Valley cannot move forward
without helping San Francisco and that city cannot be prosperous without
the interior reaping some of the benefits. You can put me down as a
friend of the semi-centennial exposition, as I believe that from whatever
notnt viewed it is the one great enterprise now in view that should enlist
the support of every public spirited citizen of the Golden West."
FROM A COMMERCIAL STANDPOINT.
It Would Prove of Inestimable Benefit to the Whole
AUBURN, March 26.â The Call's proposition for a proposed semi-centen
nial exposition to mark the fiftieth milestone of California's statehood is a
capital idea, and should meet with the
approval of every patriotic citizen.
Outside the beautiful sentiment thus
expressed, it will prove of incalculable
benefit to the State from a business
standpoint. No better opportunity
could be found In which to advertise
to the outside world the State's many
advantages, commercially and other
wise. Placer County, with its wonder
ful diversity of Interestsâ mining, fruit
growing, lumbering and farming
would certainly be the gainer by such
an exposition.
J. W. MORGAN,
Mayor, Auburn, CaL
Infantry Reglment*that were closed last
week shows that taken as a whole the
eleven companies inspected showed to
much better advantage than the majority
of them did the year previous. There
is a question as to which company made
the best all-around showing, and military
men are in doubt as to whom to award
the crown of laurel, one-half inclining to
Company K. Captain Cunningham, and
the other half to Company M, Captain
O'Xeil All admit that both companies
did exceedingly well, yet each was at
fault in some matters and the faults
charged against one company balanced
the faults charged against the other. ]
will require the decision of the inspector
to determine which one of these com
panies is entitled to the honor of being
the best. .___. Â«__j
The Cadet Corps made a showing that
was very creditable and will win for it
many points. The band, to use a current
phrase, was "all right," the cavalry might
have made a better showing, but the
signal corps was up to the standard, that
of excellence, while the staff was as fine
a show as good cloth, well-fitting clothes
and accompanying gold lace could make
the wean-rs appear.
The report of the inspector will show
that much of the clothing is unfit for
service and that the uniforms ordered
cannot come too soon. As to other details
they will appear in the report. Having
concluded in San Francisco except as to
one company, the inspector went to work
Inspecting the companies of the Fifth
Regiment.
THE NATIONALS.
Tho inspection of Companies C and G
(the Nationals) was held last Monday
night in the Ellis-street armory in the
presence of quite a number of people.
While the two companies, G, Captain Sut
liffe, first inspected, and then C, Captain
Dumbrell, made a creditable showing
there was not, from a military standpoint,
the bearing and vim for which these
companies were noted a few years ago.
Prior to falling in there was some mis
understanding, possibly because the men
had not received positive instructions on
the subject as to how they should wear
canteens and haversacks. There was ap
parent lack of instruction as to whether
| the men should wear the canteen slung
j over the haversack or wear It on the op
j posite side. The men asked each other
I and some of the officers were asked and
I after considerable talk the men appeared
j with the canteen on the right hip and the
i haversack on the left. There was but
I one company that during the inspections
demonstrated that it knew how to wear
the canteen, and that was the signal
corps. The men of that body carried the
haversac.K on the left, the web belt hold
ing down the straps and the canteen over
the haversack, but the back strap only
held by the belt. There was a lack o"f
uniformity in C and G in the matter of
scabbards, some of the men wearing them
| over the haversack and some under.
I These are matters of minor detail, but
i they create confusion and are proof that
there is not enough attention paid to
i minor matters, many of them essential
I to the proper make-up of the soldier.
The companies drilled in close order,
Company C adding loading and firing.
The companies made several breaks by
reason of the fact that only a portion of
the men when moving as platoons could
hear the orders of the commanding of
ficer.
THE SIGNAL CORPS.
The Inspection of the signal corps of
the Second Brigade. Captain P. J. Per
kins commanding, at the Ellis-street ar
mory on Wednesday night brought to a
close in this city the inspection of the lo
j cal companies except that of Company
B, Captain Fillmer. There were pres
ent, as there always is, when this crack
erjack corps has anything unusual on
hand, a large number of ladies and their
escorts, for this corps excels In person
nel, precision in carrying out the mili
tary law, drilling and in signaling, and
the ladies believe that it is their duty to
encourage the men by their presence.
Not only do the ladies think so, but many
of the old-time guardsmen, who since
retirement seldom take interest in tho
attain of the guard, make* it a busl
1 vesa to visit tbis corps wbea tbere is an
nian can feel otherwise," said the
Mayor this morning. "The project ap
peals to us from both patriotic and
business principles. . The j lan as con
ceived by Ine Call is both feasible and
practicable. Cominp as N will on the
dawn of a new century when the en
tire world is given up to a celebration
of the achievements of the most nota
ble century in written history, it will
be easy to divert the attention of the
sight-se^rs in Paris to the wonderful
new land which was touched by the
hand of Anglo-Saxon civilization less
than a half century ago. California
an I the Pacific Coast will never have
such an opportunity to show her won
ders as then, and the people of the
State.
inspection. There were a number of such
present on Wednesday night, as well as
active members. Among the spectators
were Brigadier-General Warfield, Colonel
Geisting, Colonel Frank Sumner (retired).
Major Evans, Major Schmitt, Captains
C P Le Breton and Woods (retired) and
Captain Cunningham of Company X,
First Infantry.
The corps, all present Dut two, one be
ing in attendance on a court in Santa
llosa as a witness and the other being
sick presented a fine soldierly appear
ance, with one exception and that was
the fatigue hats, which detract from
the make-up of the soldiers. Still the
men were not at fault, they were ordered
to wear them and they had to put on
what the State furnished. They were
properly sized, their uniforms were, as
they always are. exceedingly neat, the
men wore their haversacks and canteens
as they should, which was not done gen
erally during the present inspections,
their carbines and revolvers were in nrst
class condition, but the revolvers did not
meet the approval of the brigade Inspec
tor Major Jansen, who remarked still
the same old revolvers." It is likely that
h-> will recommend that the men be
armed with the new pattern. The drill
ing was in platoon movements and fir
ings, and each was so perfect that it won
the hearty commendations of spectators
as well as the inspector. Captain Car
rington was not present at this inspec
tion.
TROOP A, CAVALRY.
Troop A, Captain Burnett, was inspect
ed on Wednesday night by the brigade in
spector, assisted by Captain Carrington.
There were fifty-seven present and three
absent, but the men did not make as
good an appearance as some other
branches of the guard. There were quite
a number of the men without revolvers
! but that was not their fault as they did
| not have them to form part of the ac
i couterments. The inspection revealed
the fact that there are twenty-two re
i vo?vers short, and it is likely that the
bondsmen of the late Captain Jenks who
was the commander of the troop before
the present commanding officer, will be
called upon to either have the weapons
restored or their value, made good. There
was drill in close order and saber drill,
but as the company has many new men
in it who have not yet mastered the mi
i tricaeies of drill with carbine and saber,
| tho showing did not come up to the
' standard.
â¢ THE REGIMENTAL ARMORER.
The room of the regimental armorer,
C. M. Sheldon, in the Page-street ar
mory was also inspected by the brigade
inspector, and in it he found a complete
outfit for refilling the shells that are used
in rifle practice. The armorer finds much
of his spare time taken up in the work of
refilling the shells, and that, in addition
to his other duties, keeps him pretty
busy.
THE CADET COMPANY.
The cadet company attached to the
First Regiment of infantry, which at the
previous inspection was without excep
tion the worst to show up, has redeemed
itself. Captain Bartlett upon assuming
! command a few months since expressed
a determination to wipe out the stain that
had been cast upon the organization by
the report of the inspecting officer, and
the showing at the regimental armory
last Monday afternoon proved that he
had done much to carry out his determi
nation. In the first place all the boys
who were too small or physically too
weak to undergo the ordeal of drill with
1 regulation old-time rifles instead of cadet
rirtcs such as this corps ought to be pro
vided with, have been weeded out and a
better class or boys have been substi
tuted- then the corps has been recruite/i
i up to' within one of the maximum, name
i lv 102 but for want of uniforms there
i were but 85 in line. Before the inspection
'by Major Jansen the members of the
corps were critically examined by Colonel
Smith of the First, and after that they
IrTre inspected by the brigade inspector
and Captain Carrington. All the faults
that had been pointed out in the report of
the previous inspection by the same
officer had been rectified, me rifles were

ALL THE ESSENTIALS ARE HERE.
Concentrated Action Now Will Assure a Grand
Success for the Semi-Centennial.
Hon. T. L. Carothers, Mayor of Ukiah City, Cal., says: The Mldwin
ter Fair was of exceeding benefit to our Golden State in demonstrating to
to be held in Paris in 1900. We have
the resources, the products and the climate, which are necessary essentials
to the entertainment of strangers to our shores, not only temporarily, but to
induce them to make our State their home. "What we need now is concen
position, and the affair cannot fail of being a success. The Semi-Centennial
Celebration of the admission of California to the Union could not be more
appropriately observed than by such an exposition as proposed. All sectional
strife and divisional lines should be ignored in the observance of our golden
wedding to the Union, and every man, be he a Native Son or an adopted citi
zen, should use his best endeavors for the success of the exposition. I am
heartily in favor of the Exposition, and hope that the most sanguine expec
tations of the promoters may be reali zed.
IT WILL BE THE PROPER THING.
Gilroy's Mayor Tells of the Advantages That Would
Accrue to the State.
GILROT, March 26.â Mayor M. Ca sey of Gilroy has the following to say
concerning the semi-centennial exposition in 1900, as suggested by The Call:
"There is a great deal of work in
store for those who undertake it, but
the promoters and the State will be re
munerated a hundred fold. I am in
favor of any demonstration which will
keep California to the fore, and my
opinion is that an exposition in 1900
will be just the proper thing.
"We have already experienced the
advantages that the Midwinter Fair
accomplished in advertising our State,
and I say, keep at it. California has
always been a point of attraction,
beckoning tourists hither from afar,
but there has been no place where they
could be taken and shown all the re
sources of this glorious State.
"My opinion is that every county in
the State should take an active part
in this exposition and thereby make it
a gTand success.
"It has always been demonstrated that nothing is too vast for California,
and I believe there is a great future in store for her if we do not allow our
selves to grow indolent and lazy. We must all work in harmony and together
to accomplish the best results. The plan is a grand conception, and I hope
It will be pushed through to a finish."

in the ranks was very commendable. The
corps was drilled in extended order, the
movements were well executed, and the
young men were complimented by the in
spector for being the only company that
drilled by bugle sounds. There was an
exemplification of the bayonet drill by a
picked squad, and it was highly com
mended. It is likely that the report of the
inspector will show excellent in almost
everything.
THE NAVAL MILITIA.
As has already been announced Captain
L. H. Turner, commanding the Naval
Militia, has gone to Alaska on business
connected with the settlement of an in- j
surance claim, and it was stated on Satur- |
day that he may be absent four months. I
Lieutenant-Commander Nerney, acting
captain, on Saturday issued orders dis
continuing the practice of allowing
visitors to go on board of the Marion, for
the reason that there are not enough men
on the vessel to accompany those who
may wish to inspect the vessel. The ves
sel is now as if she were in actual war
service, the same regulations as to the
arming of the men on board, the standing
of watches and boarding and leaving the
ship being enforced.
Yesterday a number of the men belong
ing to the two divisions were out on the
bay for boat drill. While it was not an
official drill it was for practice, for the
men seem to be anxious to learn all they
can, and, with that end in view, practice
when they have an opportunity.
The report from general headquarters
places the numerical strength on the Ist
of March of the militia at 414. At this
time it is 421. _, â _, '
The Pinta reached San Diego all right

vastness of the undertaking, and the
greater and larger scale upon vhich it

that the entire Pacific Coast should use

THIRD BRIGADE.
VISALIA, March 26.â Company E of
this city is on the eve of another election
for captain, the present commander, Cap
tain Fred W. Ward, having declined to
serve another term, owing to a rush of
business matters. He has done remark
ably well in the past two years and ha 3
brought the company up to a position well
in the front rank with any other company
in the State. It is almost a settled fact
that the next captain of the company will
be George W. Stewart, the newly elected
Register of the Land Office here.
Every man in the company has signed a
petition asking him to take the office. He
was for several years an officer in the
company.
Colonel Hay of Fresno will be here on
the 22d of April to conduct the annual in
spection of the local company. Captain
Carrington of the regular army is also
expected to be present.
Colonel Stuart S. Wright was down
from Fresno last night to confer with the
officers of Company E in regard to prep
arations for placing the militia on a war
footing.
Private Samuel Hulen has passed ex
amination and has been recommended for
promotion to corporal.
For the Wolfe Tone Monument Fund.
The receipts of the St. Patrick's day
celebration amounted to $956 50 and the
expenditures were $674 15, leaving a bal
ance of $252 35 for the Wolfe Tone monu
ment fund. This financial result was re
ported at a meeting of the St. Patrick' 3
day convention held yesterday at the K.
R. B. Hall. The proceeds of the celebra
tion were not as great as had been ex
pected, yet the entertainment provided
was a gratifying success and the members
of the convention felt that their duty had
been done well.

con actor, or his agents or assigns, |
shall be authorized to demand and re- [
I ceive the amount of the several assess
ments made to cover the sum due for ;

When it shall appear by the final
judgment of any court in this State
having jurisdiction to render such judg- i
! ment, that any suit brought to foreclose j
the lien of any assessment for street |
j work made under this Chapter, or in ;
the recording thereof, has been defeated
| by reason of any defect, error, infor
i mality, omission, irregularity, or ii!e
ga'ity, thereof or therein, or in the re
turn on the warrant issued pursuant to j
1 any such assessment, or in the record- j
ing of any such warrant, any person in- j
terested therein may, at any time with- i
in {;eren months after the entry of said j

sessment shall be a lien upon the lots j
of land set out therein for the period of |
two years from the date of Its record- |
ing, and suit may be brought to enforce j
said lien as provided in this Chapter. ;
Should such final judgment be that of j
the Superior Court for the City and j
County and an appeal therefrom to the i
Supreme Court of the State has been i
taken, no such other assessment shall
be made until said appeal has been de
termined.
Sec. 13. The contractor or his as

tor, his assigns, or some person on his
or their behalf, shall receipt the ; same
upon the* assessment :in the presence i
'of the person making such payment, I
and shall also give a receipt if demand
ed. When the : persons so assessed, or
their agents, cannot conveniently be j
found or when the owner of the lot is ;
stated as "unknown" upon the assess- |
ment, then said ? contractor or his as- j
signs, or some ' person on his or their |
behalf, shall publicly demand payment |
on the premises assessed.
The warrant shall be returned to the I

gin of the record of the warrant and
assessment.

the amount due upon any assessment
and warrant issued by it and give a
good and sufficient discharge therefor;

suit has been commenced shall operate,
without the consent of the plaintiff it*
the action, as a complete discharge of
the lien until the costs in, the action
shall be refunded to the plaintiff. .

ment upon the books of its office on
the payment to it of the amount of the
assessment with interest against any
lot or on the production to it of the
receipt of the party or his assigns to
whom the assessment and warrant
were issued. If any contractor shall
fail to return his warrant within the
time and in the form provided in this
section he shall thenceforth have no
lien upon the property assessed; but if
any warrant is lost, upon proof of such

ARTICLE XII.
ACQUISITION OF PUBLIC UTIL
ITIES.
It is hereby declared to be the pur
pose and intention of the people of the
City and County that its public utilities
shall be gradually acquired and ulti
mately owned by the City and County.
To this end it is hereby ordained:
SECTION 1. Within one year from
the date upon which this Charter shall
go into effect, and at least every two
years thereafter -until the object ex
pressed in this provision shall have
been fully attained, the Supervisors
must procure through the City Engi
neer plans and estimates of the actual
cost of the original construction and
completion by the City and County of
water works, gas works, electric light
works, steam, water or electric power
works, telephone lines, street railroads
and such other public utilities as tho
Supervisors or the people by petition to
â  the Board may designate.
In securing estimates of the original
cost of the construction and completion
of water works by the City and County,
the Supervisors must procure and place
on file plans and estimates of the cost
!of obtaining from all of the several
available sources a sufficient and per
manent supply of good, pure water for
the City and County, in order that
I propositions for the acquisition, con
; struction and completion thereof, and
i the incurring of municipal indebtedness
therefor, may be submitted to the elec
tors of the City and County as herein
after set forth.
Sec. 2. After such plans and esti
! mates shall have been procured and
; filed, the Supervisors shall, at as early
' a date as they may deem for the best
interests of the City and County, enter
into negotiations for the permanent ac
quisition by the City and County, by
original construction, condemnation or
purchase of such or any of said
public utilities as they may regard
most important to the City and County
to be first acquired, and to formulate
and submit to the electors of the City
and County, at a special election, prop
ositions for the permanent acquisition
and ownership thereof.
Before submitting propositions to
the electors for the acquisition by orig
inal construction or condemnation, of
public utilities, the Supervisors must
solicit and consider offers for the sale
to the City and County of existing util
ities in order that the electors shall
have the benefit of acquiring the same
at the lowest possible cost thereof.
Sec. 3. When a petition or petitions
signed by electors of the City and
County equal in number to fifteen per
centum of all the votes cast at the last
preceding general election shall be pre
sented to the Supervisors, setting forth
that the signers thereof favor the ac
quisition by the City and County of any
public utility, and requesting the
Board to prepare for submission to the
electors of the City and County, aa
hereinafter provided, a proposition for
the acquisition of such utility, it shall
be the duty of the Board to immediate
ly take such steps or to enter into such
negotiations as will enable It to formu
late such a proposition for submission
to the electors as aforesaid. Such prop
osition shall be so formulated and com
pleted within six months from the date
of the filing of such petition. The Clerk
of the Supervisors must, immediately
upon the filing of the aforesaid petition
or petitions, after examining and veri
fying the signatures thereto, transmit
an authenticated copy thereof, without
the signatures, to the Board of Election
Commissioners, and another such copy
to the Mayor, together with a certifi
cate that the required number of signa
tures are appended to the original. The
Mayor shall also have the right to for
mulate and submit to the electors &
separate proposition from that formu
lated by the Supervisors for the acqui
sition of the utility named in said peti
tion. At the next municipal election af
ter the formulation of such proposi
tions by the Supervisors and the May
or, the Board of Election Commission
ers shall submit to the electors the two
alternative propositions. The proposi
tion receiving a majority of the votes
cast thereon shall be adopted; but in
case the votes cast In favor of both
1718
propositions shall not exceed one-half
the total number of votes cast thereon,
both propositions shall be deemed re
jected.
Nothing in this section, shall be so
construed as to prohibit the Supervis
ors from responding to the aforesaid
petition of the electors requesting the
acquisition of any public utility by pro
ceeding at once, without the submission
of propositions to the electors as afore
said, to pass an ordinance declaring its
determination to acquire the same a&
provided in section six of this Article
and from proceeding thereafter to ac
quire the same in the manner herein
after provided. ...
Sec. 4. In case the cost of any pub ie
utility sought to be acquired under the
provisions of this Article, can be paid
out of the annual revenues of the city
and County, in addition to the other
necessary expenditures thereof, it shall
be lawful to acquire the same by a ma
jority vote of the electors voting there
on at any special election. In submit
ting propositions to the electors for
such acquisition the Supervisors shall
specify in such proposition the cost .of
the public utility, the proposed method
and manner of payment therefor, and
submit to the electors the question
-whether the same shall be acquired
upon such terms.
In case however, the cost of such
public utility sought to be acquired
under the provisions of this Article
shall so far exceed the annual revenues
of the City and County, in addition to
the other necessary expenditures there
of as to render it necessary to incur a
municipal bonded indebtedness for such
purpose, then the Supervisors, in sub
mitting propositions to the electors for
the acquisition thereof, shall specify
therein the amount of the proposed
bonded indebtedness, the rate of inter
es< thereon, and whether such bonded
indebtedness shall be incurred. At
least two-thirds of the electors voting
thereon at such election shall be neces
sary to secure such acquisition and to
warrant the issuance of municipal
bonds therefor, as hereinafter set forth.
Sec. 5. When the electors by vote
shall have determined, as hereinbefore
set forth, to acquire any public utility,
such action on the part of the electors
shall be equivalent to the passing of
the ordinance by the Supervisors de
claring such determination as set forth
in section six of this Article, and the
Supervisors shall proceed without de
lay to pass an ordinance calling a
special election as required by section
seven of this Article.
Sec. 6. When the Supervisors shall de
termine that the public interest or ne
cessity demands the acquisition, con
struction or completion of any public
utility, the cost of which will be too
great to be paid out of the ordinary an
nual income and revenue of the City and
County, the Supervisors shall, by or
dinance, specifically declare such de
termination, and shall publish the same
for at least two weeks in the official
n< wspaper.
Sec. 7. At the next regular meeting of
the Supervisors after the publication of
the ordinance declaring said deter
mination as above set forth, or at an
adjourned meeting thereof, or not less
than two weeks nor more than four
weeks after the electors by vote shall
have determined to acquire any public
utility, the Supervisors by ordinance
shall" call a special election, at which
shall be submitted to the electors the
proposition of acquiring such public
utility, and of incurring a debt fur the
acquisition of the same as set forth in
such ordinance. X" question ether
than the acquisition of such utility and
the incurring- of the indebtedness
therefor shall be submitted at such
election.
Sec. 8. The ordinance calling such
special election shall recite the objects
and purposes for which the indebted
ness is proposed to be incurred, the es
timated cost of the proposed public
utility, the necessity for the acquisition
of the same, and that bonds of the City
and County phnll issue for the payment
of the cost of the same as ir> such or
dinance set forth (if the proposition be
accepted by the electors), and shall fix
c day on which such special election
shall be held, the manner of holding
such election, and the manner of voting
for or against incurring such indebted
ness. Such election shall be held as
provided by law for holding elections
in the City and County.
Sec. 9. Such ordinance shall be pub
lished daily for at least ten days in the
official newspaper. At the expiration
of said ten days the Supervisors shall

The Associated Charities Might Be
the Means of Saving Much
Indigent Money.
Oak'and Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, March 27.
â  There are. no doubt/ many arguments
yet to be brought forward on both sides
of the consolidation question, but the
Merchants' Exchange and Board of Trade,
>n their reports on the question, have
put forward one unanswerable point In
its favor.
I They both agree that anything that will
break up the present corruption in the
Proposed Clubhouse to Be Erected at Piedmont Springs.
i OAKLAND, March 26.â -After several
years of desertion the old Piedmont
Springs grounds are being transformed
into a garden spot that will be a fea
ture during the coming season. The
realty syndicate, under the direct su
pervision of its secretary, Frank C. Ha
vens, has adopted the design of D. F.
city pnvernment will be a distinct bene- |
fit." and of this there can be no doubt. ]
The last year has been a revelation, even
to those wno had reason to believe they
knew a good deal aDout politics. If there
has been nothing oone that can be made
amenable to the law, there has been [
ignominy heaped on the city by the
cheapest lot of officials that ever mistook
the purpose for which they were elected,
and this is detriment enough. Of course,
there are a few exceptions, but the line is
bo closely drawn that there is no danger ;
of confusing the sheep and the goats.
This phase of the unpleasantness, how
ever, is only -a minor one. The GOO mer
chants who have undertaken to bring
about, if possible, some improvement,
realize that the few men who nold offices :
for a short time and then are buried
forever constitute a very small grievance. ,
The ax that is being ground at this time
is intende-d to do away entirely with about j
one-hplf of the omcials and thus remove
about or.? -half of the inducement to do
dirty politics in the Interest of anybody,
or corporation, that will aid in their
election. There are now so many de
partments In the city and county gov
ernments that when anything radically
wrong does take place no one 13 guilty.
There is at the present time quite a good- [
sized hole in the county treasury, and
no one made it. Two grand juries have
returned Indictments regarding the short- :
age. but in the courts it has been proved
that no one is guilty, because of the con
nict between the responsibilites of de
partments. There are other things as
flagrant in both the city and county gov
ernments, and the merchants believe that
there is enough horse sense among them
to bring about a condition of affairs
wfcich will tend toward a semblance of
honest government.
The arguments of the merchants are I
just now being daily supported by the de- j
velopments before the Grand Jury, and if j
all the evidence being taken does not re- j
suit in any indictments, it has opened the ;
eyes of the public to much of which It had j
never dreamed. It has called attention to
the fact that there is need of a change
and has directed attention to certain in
fluencea and individuals that are working ,
together to rob the taxpayers and de
fame the city. Only a politician can at
ford to follow a policy that hurts the city !
abroad. As a rule he is an impecunious
fortune seeker, willing to do anything for
office and having no stake in the commu
nity to lose. The merchant looks at the ;
to show for it except a record that her ,
JreasuVy is a good thing for comiption
iS The Board of Trade and Merchants' j
FxchanKe represent many millions of |
mv, "â¢ " P capital and any practical move |
thVv may make looking toward decency |
and economy will certainly prove, to be
populw "with the bulk of the people.
One of the most remarkable features
I of office-holding in Oakland is that it
: inures a man to almost anything. He can
be asked all sorts of questions and. they
i can contain all sorts of suggestions, but
I they do not phase the office-holderâ ln
Â°Ll 1 sY IFriday1 Friday an interview was published
wfch Mayor Thomas that is probably
without parallel. Why each question was
not followed by justifiable homicide . on
the Dart- of his Honor cannot be under-
SoodStelde of Oakland. Here are a
ftw examples of the questions asked.

The questions were all readily answered, |
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 28, IS9B.
; and the replies were all calm denials of
ar.ytmng suggestive of wrong. That was
| to be expected, but where else on this
green earth could any one go to a city
official, hurl such insinuations at him and
live?
There is much merit and certainly
ground for thought in the suggestion that
: the Associated Charities should handle
the indigent funds of the county. There
ar' 1 five Supervisors who average about
$3000 a year apiece in their indigent fund.
â ': TM â  'C-asinn a Supervisor spent $6000
in one yearâ an average of |500 p>r mnnth.
It is to be presumed that the Supervisors,
: before they give an order to an applicant.
, maKe inquiry as to his or her worth, but
i it cannot be supposed that the officer fol
! lows them to the store and sees that they
: do not "my cigars, wine, beer and luxur
ies. Instead of necessary food. The sys
i tern at pjrst-nt in vogue is perforce loose
and unsatisfactory, and, therefore, ex
pensive and wasteful. The -A/^.vlated
! Charities covers all denominations, is
y.' s ]y directed, has pubic confidence, and
if it can be done legally, the Supervisors
should be the first to move to be relieved
of their difficult hurrien.

The funeral of Mrs. Saloma Anderson.
who claimed to be the only woman that
was ever initiated into the Masonic fra

Masonic Temple. The beautiful hall was
crowded with the friends of the deceased,
besides a large number of the curious.
The services were conducted by the offi

Numerous accounts of the manner in
which Mrs. Anderson scoured the sec

surely possessed, have been published.
Her own account of thp affair, and one
of which she never tired of teiling, was
that it occurred in France. She "was
living at the home of an uncle, where the
Masons met. She cut a hole in the floor
upstairs through the ceiling and at night
watched the workings below. When she
was satisfied that she had the secret
work she made her first visit to the

she approached the door, gave the sig

that she was an impostor. In order to

campus this afternoon was the scene of
a most hotly contested game of ball be
tween ; the college nine anil the Y. M. I.

NOW WANT A DIRECT TAX.
President Boone of the Board of Edu
cation Believes Such a Measure
Would Carry.
BERKELEY. March 27.â The defeat of
the $60,000 bonds for a new high school
building has greatly discouraged those
who actively supported the measure, but
they propose in the near future to inaug
urate a movement in favor of raising
money for a new building by means of a
direct tax. P. R. Boone, president of the
Board of Education, and a prominent
member of the Good Government Club,
stated this evening that the supporters of
the recent bonding proposition have not
yet met to consider just what course they
will take, but that probably they will
work to have a special election called Â«n
the question of levying a direct tax.
"A great deal of the opposition to the
bonds." he said, "came from the voters
Of West Berkeley, but there were a large
number of East Berkeleyans who opposed
the measure because they thought it was
the wrong way of raising the money.
To levy a direct tax would only require
a majority vote and not a two-thirds vote
as in the case of the bonds, and I am
confident that the former would carry.
"The reason that we did not have a vote
on the direct tax measure in the first
place wa^ that when the money is to be
raised by a direct tax we cannot a.sk for
more than $13,000 or $20,000, on account of
the burden on the tax payers. We really
need $60,000 and we thought that this sum
could be more easily raised by one bond
election than by several direct tax elec
tions."
Reception to Graduates.
BERKELEY. March 27.â Chief among

BASEBALL IS IN FULL
BOOM AT TWO PARKS
The Pacific State League's
Opening Game Attended
by 3000 People.
Santa Cruz Downed the Local
Contingent In a Fast and
Interesting Game.
A Live Ball and Live Players Aroused
Great Enthusiasm at Central
Park.
President Eugene F. Bert's countenance

on the large outpouring of "cranks" at

League in Central Park yesterday. A
more favorable day for an opening game
could not have been chosen, and nearly
3000 people sat in the warm sunshine
watching a game full of ginger and con
stantly cheering both teams. The style
of playing that was put up yesterday
will be the means of raising the game to
the position it occupied in the old days.
Promptly at 2 o'clock Santa Cruz took
the field for practice arrayed in their
natty and serviceable uniforms. They
were all there. Captain â¢'Bill" Deveraux.
he of the auburn hair and lusty voice
fame; little "Louie" Balsz. ready to pitch
as he did when he was winning fame on
Mike Finn's nine; -Buck Airman**, and
the same men who gave Santa Crux its
good name last year.
Alter indulging in circus catches and
grand stand plays to their heart's con
tent, they gave way to the local aggrega
tion, composed of men who have become
famous In the busta.l world, and who
will add further taster to their names
as on as they get down to form. In
â¢â¢josh' Reilly, Mertes and Gimmel, San
Francisco has an inlicld which ranks with
any nine in the league.
The arrangements tor beginning the
season were perfect. The pla>ers ad
journed to their club house where they
formed in line and. headed by a brasS
oand and a leader carrying the beautiful
pennant presented by Governor Budd for
competition, they marched up the field,
receiving the cheers of the multitude.
San Francisco was first at bat, and as
Mertes stepped to the plate he was given
a cordial reception, which was also be
stowed upon the members of both teams.
Mi lies caught the live ball on the nose
and sent it over second for a neat single,
and stole second. The next three up
landed heavily on the sphere, but one of
Santa Cruz's a crt fielders would be under
it, to the chagrin of the batter.
Although making innumerable errors,
â¢ i -".. . .i * ... n . on vviin
Mr. Johnson's shoots, virtually batted
their way to victory. Aided by a base or
two on balls and two heavy smashes, the
â  Beachcombers" ande i their first run.
In the third Santa Cruz landed on John
son for five safe swats, which netted them
five runs. A base on balls gave them an
other, and things began to take on a
biuish tint for tiie locaj nine. In Uieir naif
the San Francisco aggregation saved it
self from the ignominy of a shut out, by
scoring.
.>Â», ...atter how hard they strived Santa
Cruz could not land another run until the
seventh inning, owing to the splendid
fielding of the home team, Mertes and
Keilley being a veritable stonewall in
their positions.
Frisco had the satisfaction of seeing
the score narrowed down m the remain
ing innings, and had they not been
afiiicted with an aggravated case of
hoodoo they might have tied the score.
Time and again they would land a man
on first., but the next batter up would
poke an easy one to some portion of the
lot and the unlucky base-runner would
only sigh and think of what might have
happened.
Johnson gave evidence of being a first
class twirler, but showed a lack of form.
At times he was wild, but little Charley
Drews would quiet him down by soothing
coaching. The latter caught a fine game
and proved himself a valuable acquisition
to the home team.
The work of Mclntyre in center field
caled forth constant applause. It is very
seldom that a fielder gets an opportunity
to show his caliber, but in yesterday's
game he accepted six different flies with
out a miss.
"Graceful" Maguire's temper was his
undoing. He played the Initial position
In fine style and was a tower of strength
to the Frisco's Infield, but it's all off with
him now. During the game Charley
Daubenbis In running to first collided
heavily with Maguire, and the latter,
thinking It intentional, swore at the
Santa Cruz player. Daubenbls replied,
but before hostilities could commence Mc-
Grath bunted the ball and Daubenbis
went to .second. After tne game "Grace
ful" attempted to assault Daubenbts, but
was prevented. President Bert was
grieved that the tall first baseman should
lose his temper, but to make an example
h>> expelled him from the league.
For Santa Cruz. Deveraux and Arel
lanea were the particular stars; both
made running catches that seemed im
possible until the ball nestled in their
hands. Balsz has lost none of his clever
ness or speed, and the victory was par
tially due to his heady twirling.
Should the Pacific States league con
tinue to put up as excellent ball as it did
yesterday, lovers of good baseball can be
assured of a fine season. Centra! Park
ha? been renovated and the field Is In
perfect order. "With a live ball and live
players the popular pastime will surely
rise in public favor.

Championship.
A Circus Game Replete With
Brilliant Plays and Hard
Stick Work.
Ewing's Colts Show a Surprising
Burst of Speed, but Fail to
Land in the Lead,
At 1:30 o'clock yesterday afternoon there
was a strange proceeding in one of the
dressing rooms at Recreation Park. Man
ager Cal Ewing rounded up his drove of
colts and after a careful inspection to see
that they were properly groomed, drew
from his overcoat pocket a box of those
little speed lozenges that have been thÂ«
cause of many bad upsets of favorites at
the race track and administered three to
each of his band. Then, in succession, he
gave them an extra charge from a galvanic
battery, after which he turned them out
into the yard.
Over in the first corner was lightning
Jack Donovan, the phenomenon with the
revolving breast bone which enables him
to go the entire circuit without touching
his feet to the ground.
At the half noisy Tip O'Neil was sta
tioned.' He is noisy no longer, but is as
full of ginger as he was the day he made
his first appearance at the old Haight
street grounds years ago. Though
charged with a couple of misplays, they
were all excusable, and he gave those
who "thought he had long ago lost his
speed a surprise by the force and accu
racy of his throwing.
Big Fred Lange at third was another
player who has been resuscitated and en
tered in the yearling stakes. Lange has
just recovered from a severe attack of
illness and has not touched a ball before
this season, so the three errors marked
up against him were due to lack of pre
paratory work. .â ':,â 
Away out in the right pasture that in
fant prodigy, Lou Hardie, who plays ball
although he has not grown a full head of
hair yet, performed one of the star feats
of the day in shooting a line drive that
was sent out by special delivery over to
third ahead of Murphy, who was at sec
ond. Besides that and a skyrocket catch
of a long fly, Lou touched off a double
and a single out of four times up, all of |
which tends to prove that he will be a |
world-beater when he is full-grown.
Of the others in Ewing's string Moski
nion, perhaps, attracted the most atten
tion. He is built somewhat upon the
plan of a pair of scissors and Is quite a
juggler with the ball. He was found for \
ten hits, three of which were of the j
scratch order, but he has absolute con
i trol of the ball, and when he becomes j
better acquainted he will prove a mys- j
tery to the best of them. But where he |
shines particularly bright is in watching !
the bases. Four of San Francisco's best
men were caught napping not six feet I
from the bag, two in rapid succession,
but he snaps the ball across with such
rapidity when seemingly he is looking in
another direction, that the runner is |
tagged out before he realizes what has
happened.
Smeer, at short, gave what might be
termed an illustration of a human sieve,
but he goes for everything in sight, is a i
hard sticker and fast base-runner.
Peters is a good man behind the bat ,
and a safe batter, while Dean and Shea
are both good men. On the whole, Ewing
surprised the cranks with the strength of ,
his team fully as much as did Manager j
McGlynn of San Jose.
With the exception of Monahan, who j
played center, and H. Krug. who pitched, j
an Francisco presented the same team j
as on Saturday. The changes were bene- j
ficial, for the locals put up such a game j
as won the championship for them last j
year. K rug's box work and Brockhoff '<> j
play at third until he twisted his ankle
and had to retire from the game, were
the brightest spots in the team's bril
liant display, though no fault could be
found with any member of the team.
Four to three with the home team on
the long end was what the Scoreboard
showed at the close of one of the fastest i
games played here in years. Nine full
innings in an hour and twenty-live min
utes is what may be called speedy ball. |
And there was not a dull spot in all that '
time. Even the errors added to the in
terest, for they only tended to Increase
the uncertainty, owing to the neck and
neck score. It was not until Peters, the
third and last man up in the ninth, sent |
out a comet to Hearty, which that young I
man deftly pocketed, that the locals were
certain they had won the game. Base
hits nipped in the bud by catlike infield
ers, double and -triples picked out of the
sky by animated flying machines, two
double plays by the Krug brothers and
Murphy and similar pyrotechnical effects
by other members of the double company
constituted an afternoon's entertainment
that is not likely to be discounted this
season.
But the star feature of the day was con
tributed by Henry Krug in the ninth in- |
ning. O'Neil, who had been sending up i
sky-rockets all day, changed his tactics j
when he went* to bat for the last time i
and drove a liner that would have sunk
a Spanish battleship had it struck broad
side on. It was a solid shot and had a
muzzle velocity of 200,000 feet a second.
Krug didn't have time to dodge it, but
fortunately his hands were still raised af
ter delivering the ball, and as it came
back it struck his palms â and stuck to )
them. It was a wonderful catch and it
set the spectators into howls of applause.
It is small wonder that with such base
ball dished up to them the cranks had lit
tle time to devote to admiring Pugilist
Jeffries, who was escorted on the dia
mond by the Colonel and assisted Jim
McDonald In umpiring. Jeffries only gave
one decision; he called a runner safe at
first, which met with such marked dls
iavor from the kindergarten that he din
creetly retired and watched the rest of
the game from the players' bench.
San Francisco â  was first up and scored
on Lange's low throw to first of Mona
han's hot grounder, which he fielded in.
excellent shape. Murphy drove out a
double to left field fence, sending Mona
han home. Karl Krug popped up a fly
which Shea dropped, but recovered in
time to cut Murphy off at third, and al
though -Krug got around to Lange's cor
ner on Hearty's single, Brockhoff could
not get home.
â  H. Krug showed his effectiveness by re
tiring Oakland on thsÂ°e â¢* pitched balls
âtwo infield hits 'that' were cleverly i
fielded and a fly to left. In the last half i
of the second, though, the Colts evened
up matters when Hardie drove a hot one
to short, which Kelly partly blocked but
couldn't get. Lou was sacrificed to second
and scored on Dean's long single to right.
There was no change in the score until
the sixth, when the locals got a man
around after two were out. Karl Krug
drove a double to right for two cushion*,
and Hearty was safe on Smeer's fumble
of his grounder. Krug was held at sec
ond, and the ball was returned to Moskj
mon, who snapped It , down to O'Neil, |
catching Krug asleep. Tip threw the ball
back to ' Muskimon, who whirled and
played the same trick on r Hearty at first."
Then Be doffed his cap in response to the
cheers. Brockhoff was safe on Lange's i
low throw to first after making a great
pick-up of his grounder, and scored on
Kelly's double to right.
Oakland took the lead in its half, Smeer
making a single and Lange being given
his base. Hardie smashed out a double,
Smeer scoring, and Lange came home
when Monahan dropped Shea's fly.
In the eighth San Francisco won the !
game, when, with two men out, Brockhoff
reached second on Smeer's fumble. Kelly
hit to short, and Brockhoff started Sto
third. The ball beat him there and he
turned back to second. He made the bag,
but. hurt his ankle so that he. had to re- I
tire, Conley being substituted. Stroecker !
scored both runners with a triple to cen- |
ter, and though the Colts tried desperately |
to pull out they were unable to make an- I
other run. The score follows:

game in the first inning, when, owing to
the erratic box work of Fitzpatrick and
to their heavy stick work,, they piled up

SAN JOSE, March 27.â A large crowd, a
closely contested game and old-time en

ball season. The lead oscillated between
the Oakland and San Jose teams and the
issue was in doubt until the last man was
retired. Oakland had a lead of two ac

STOCKTON, March 27.â The first Stock
ton game of the California League was
won by the Sacramento team from the
home aggregation by a score of 4 to 3.
The same was called in the middle <-f
the seventh inning, as the visiting play
ers were compelled to catch the 4 o'clock
train for Sacramento. Neither team
played the men the managers expected
to have on the diamond, and the game
was not characterized by brilliant play
ing on the part of either nine. Stockton
played Harper and Huffman in the points
and the visitors had Rockeneld and Sul
livan. Harper is credited with eight
strike-outs and Rockc-neld with seven.

A State Institution That Is Ruled
by Blunderers and Bad
Laws.
According: to Superin
tendent Hayes of* the
Oakland Asylum Tor the
Adult Itlind the institu
tion is running' behind
because of bad laws,
-which handicap the
management from buy
ing: raw material in the
open market. There is a
shortage of Â«IOK7 iitf in
**ne funil, and this is be
ing: increased because the
factory is compelled to
run on a basis that forces
the sale of brooms that
cost Â£1 31 at 9O cents.
Secretary of State 1 .. 11.
Brown has Just com
pleted an investigation
of the institution, and he
charges that there is
gross mismanagement,
although he exonerate**
the superintendent and
blames the board of di
rectors and the bad law*.
lie says the shortage is
$6000, and that the place
is conducted without dis
cipline or sound business
management, some in
mates being gifted with
wealth and good eye
sight.
Unless all signs fall there will soon
be a thorough revision of matters con
nected with the Adult Asylum for the
Blind in Oakland.
Superintendent Hayes says the busi
ness results are necessarily bad, the
laws governing the institution being
cumbersome, antiquated and a handi
cap to business methods.
Secretary of State L.. H. Brown un
hesitatinply declares that his recent in
vestigations have shown an "astound
ing state of affairs," and makes sweep-
ing charges of mismanagement, while
Expert Lewis laughed in his sleeve as
he read the figures that showed how
brooms are being made for $1 31, and
sold in the markets at 90 cents, simply
because the law says that brooms must
be made and sold, and that the factory
must run.
"This means that we are losing right
along," Superintendent Hayes said last
night. "My books shows that there is
a deficit of $1987 26 for this year, and
the loss must grow greater as the -fac
tory continues."
To make the conclusions of the three
men heretofore quoted clear to the
public it should be explained that there
is a law that compels the institution to
run continuously, the broom corn and
other raw materials being bought by
contract. According to Superintendent
Hayes this is a great handicap. He
says he has received offers of corn at a
cost of $33 a ton less than Is being paid
here, the offers coming from the East.
The other factor in the case that mili
tates against the local institution is
that the blind men work slowly with the
best material, and their goods have to
come In competition witn poorer ma
terials made by machinery in the
East.
"The high prices paid for raw mate
rial and the shrinkage in the price of
the manufactured article are responsi
ble very largely for our deficit," said
Mr. Hayes last nipht. Continuing, he
said that the place was economically
managed. "We feed the inmates at a
cost of 25 cents per capita per day, and
feed them well. I file away all bills of
fare and the food list shows such things
daily as oatmeal, mush, boiled ham,
toast and eggs for the sick, roast mut
ton, potatoes, beans, fruit and tea, cof
fee and milk. I defy any one to show
that there is any extravagance or suf
f.-ring, but the simple fact is that the
brooms which we are obliged to sell at
90 cents cost us, when freight is added,
$1 31, and this will net a loss right
along."
A summary of the figures now in the
hands of the State Board of Examin
ers shows the following: Cash receipts
from factory from July 1 to March 16,
$11.276 13; balance on hand, $81194: un
paid bills. $7081 77; bills receivable,
$2982 57; raw material, $1300, showing a
total deficit of $1987 26.
Speaking of the situation last night
Secretary of State Brown said:
"In the first place there are quite a
number of people maintained there by
the State who should not be there. As
I entered for instance, I saw one of the
inmates reading a paper without
glasses. Now I believe that there should
be no one admitted there who is not to
tally blind. In the next place there are
several of the inmates who have money
deposited in the bank. One of them is
worth $40,000, and yet he is fed and
cared fo-r by the State without a cent's
cost to him. There should be such a
change in the law as would enable the
Directors to compel people who are
able to pay something for their keep
ing. Of course so far as the indigent
are concerned the State always has
and always will provide for them.
"In the next place there is a total
lack of discipline. The inmates go and
come as they see fit without even giv
ing notice when they depart. So far
as the management of the broom fac
tory Is concerned, there is certainly a
<. -nance for some decided improvements.
They are now paying $30 a ton more
for their broom straw than private fac
tories pay. When I asked about this
strange and unbusinesslike state of af
fairs they informed me that it was due
to a combination made among the bid
ders. An Eastern firm offered to fur
nish them with broom corn for $60
per ton, and they are paying $90 for it,
and the contract will run until next
June. On the other hand, there is not
an item about the institution which is
not paid for almost in the same pro
portion. I do not want to be under
stood as claiming that there is any
thing like a concerted plan to rob the
State, but I do claim that some very
decided changes should be inaugurated
in the management of the business
portion of the concern or there is no
telling where the drain will finally
flow.
"They are now $6000 behind in their
broom fund, and that after operating
but ten months. To be exact, there are
now on file in the office of the State
Controller claims to the amount of
$0270, and there is not a dollar in the
fund to pay them. I believe there is
something like a few hundred dollars'
worth of stock on hand, but it is not
enough to pay the inmates the back
pay which is due them.
"There was once a system there by
which the inmates were not paid a
very fancy price for their labor, but
no charge was made for their board
and lodging. The new board raised the
compensation of the inmates 30 per

cent, and those who average from $S
to $12 a week are expected to pay $5 of
that for board.
"I think the old system was the best,
as there are many there who cannot
earn enough to pay anything for
board, and that makes a distinction
among them which I do no. believe
should exist. There are 108 inmates
there in ailâ 9o males and 18 females.
The latter can only be employed in
making whisk brooms and toy brooms,
and are lucky if they earn 15 cents a
day.
'â¢Most of them range from fifty years
up, and to expect them to earn enough
to sustain the broom factory under the
present conditions is out of the ques
tion. All of their machinery is old
fashioned, and it is simply impossible
for them to make i article that will
compete with the product of modern
machinery. They are working as light
as they can now, and of course there
is no hope of them paying up this
$6000 shortage. It will have to be done
by allowing a deficiency. The State ap
propriated $45,000 for the two years, but
of course none of that could be used
for paying the deficiency in the broom
factory fund. That is for the mainte
nance and general support of the insti
tution. I have always understood that
there was not much politics in the
management of the institution, but I
noticed that ou of the twenty-two em
ployes there are only five of the old
ones left since the board became Dem
ocratic."
When asked how long the directors
had been paying $30 per ton more than
any one else for broom corn, . Mr.
Brown replied:
"Two years."
"They claim a defect in the law, do
they not?"
"Yes."
"Then why was the law not remedied
at the last session of the Legislature?"
"You will have to ask me something
easier," answered Mr. Brown, and con
tinuing, said: "Had they secured such
amendments as they claim will be nec
essary before they can purchase as any
one else purchases, they would have
sav^d $3000 on their last contract, as
they buy about 100 tons per year. An
other thing I noticed, and that was
while there has been only an increase
of twelve inmates in 1897 over 1896, the
increase in the pay to inmates of 1897
as compared to 1596 is $2260. Of course
I do not pretend to say that such an
increase was a proner one. but it looks
a little unreasonable to an unpreju
diced mind."
Tn speaking of the Superintendent,
Mr. Brown said: "T do not wish to be
understood as -implicating Mr. Hayes in
any of those transactions wherein the
State has paid out 30 per cent more
monoy for material than a private in
dividual would have to pay. I only
know that my investigations show that
such has been the practice, and such is
the practice in vogue there to--day, and
if there are good reasons for it, I pre
sume the Directors will be pleased to
make them known.
"At any rate there should be some
very decided changes In the present law
governing the institution."
