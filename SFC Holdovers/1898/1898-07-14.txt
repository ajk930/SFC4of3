PLAYA DEL ESTE, Guantanamo Bay, July 13.â Ma-
General Miles to-day assumed command of the army
around Santiago, and the future movements of the United
es troops will be directed by him in person.
The armistice which had been declared, pending nego
tiations for the surrender of the Spanish forces, will expire at
noon to-morrow, and unless the demands of the Americans
are acceded to by that time, a general attack will be made,
the fleet bombarding the city from outside the harbor. It is
believed, however, that to-morrow morning â and perhaps
before thru â a white rlag will be flying from the fortifica
tions.
The terms of surrender insisted upon by the American
commander take in not only the beleaguered Spaniards in
dago, but the whole province of Santiago de Cuba, in
ing the garrisons at Manzanillo, Ilolguin, Guantanamo
I ierraco.
The United States, on its part, agrees to send the Span
ish troops back to Spain and to allow their officers their
?*i<le arms. Xo other concessions will be granted.
NEW YORK. July 13.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: It is unconditional surrender
or battle to a finish to begin at noon
to-morrow. At last the climax In the
):illltary situation of Santiago haa
come.
"Yellow Jack" has forced It. This
dreaded disease has bo aggravated an
already ugly condition that the au
thorities in Washington have felt con
strained to give peremptory orders to
i ur military and naval commanders at
Santiago that there shall be no more
dickering for peace or delay under
cover of a (lag of truce after the hour
mentioned.
These dispatches made public by the
War Department this afternoon crive
thfÂ» status of affairs at Santiago up to
a Into houi this afternoon:

that he was without hope of escape and
had no right to continue th'j fiprht. I

"PLATA DEL ESTE. July 13.âSecre
tary of War: At a. meeting between
the lines at which General Shatter and
General Wheeler and the Spanish gen

claimed that ho is unable to act with
out authority of his Government, but
has received authority to withdraw and
surrender the harbor, forts, munitions
of war and the eastern portion of Cuba.
He urgently request! until to-morrow
noon to receive an answer from his
Government regarding the offer of our
Government to send his forces to Spain,
which was granted.
"MILES. Major General Commanding:."
On the bulletin giving General Miles'
dispatch was written underneath the
following:
"Permission to withdraw was de

These dispatches. Important as they
ere. give only the military side. Other
messages showing that yellow fever
has broken out among the troops,
which have not be* n made public in
detail, add n still gloomier chapter to
the story Of in- day ami have so alarm
ed tho President nnd his official advis
ers that orders of a most positive char
acter have gone to the commanders be
fore Santiago, which admit of no fur
ther delay than afternoon to-morrow
In taking Santiago.
The San Francisco Call
The authorities have almost ceased to
hope for the unconditional surrender of
the Spanish troops until forced to do
so by shot and shell.
At this hour, as far as heard from, it
rests with the Madrid authorities as to
whether General Toral will surrender
before noon to-morrow. The breaking
out of yellow fevr among our troops,
will, it is feared, encourage Spain to
refuse in the hope of prolonging the in
evitable.
The messages sent to General Shafter
| and General Miles to-day have not
been made public The only official
statement given out in connection with
| th* dispatch from General Miles is that
"permission to withdraw has been de
clined by the War Department." It is
i known, however, that as a result of
; deliberations in the special Cabinet
meeting, which lasted for two hours
to-day, important dispatches were sent
to military and naval commanders at
Santiago, both In relation to the mili
tary operations and the handling of
yellow fever cases.
In referring to that feature of Gen
: eral Miles' dispatch in reference to an
offer of our Government to send the
Spanish forces back to Spain. Secretary
Alger said this evening that It had been
determined if General Toral surrend
| prod unconditionally without further
I fighting the Spanish troops would be
sent back to Spain. But the Secretary
says if this Is done they must go back
to Spain as prisoners of war and that
nothing short of unconditional sur
render at noon to-morrow will prevent
the joint attack of both the army and
I navy, which will be waged unceasingly
I until Santiago has fallen. The proposi"
i tionto send the Spanish prisoners back
| to Spain does not necessarily mean a
| conditional surrender, the Secretary
| says, but it Is only what the adminis
tration proposes to do voluntarily after
the surrender occurs.

steamed close inshore near Aguadores
this afternoon. At the same time the
New York, Brooklyn. Oregon. Massa
chusetts and Indiana were stripped for
action. The GJoncogtor and Tosemite
ran under the bluff as if to cover the
landing of troops. After maneuvering
for two hours the Yale and Columbia
returned to anchorage off Siboney. Tt
appears that the plan for landing' the
troops miscarried owing to the failure
of the army to give the signal agreed
upon. Another effort will be made to
morrow.
The fleet will probably bombard the
outer forts of Santiago simultaneously
with the landing of troops alon~ the
be.eh In a combined movement with
the nrmy. The Cubans are now closing
in on Santiago to the westward of
Morro. Therefore the landing of troops
at Aguadores will completely encircle
the city, rendering the escape of the
Spaniards impossible. t

MANILA, July 9, via Hong
kong", July 13. â General Aguin
aldo on July 6 sent an armed
steamer to Isla de Grande in Su
big Bay to capture the island,
whereupon the German cruiser
Irene intervened. That was re
ported to Rear Admiral Dewey,
who sent the Raleigh and Con
cord with orders to take the isl
and and hand it over to the insur
gents.
The Raleigh fired several shots.
One six-inch shell hit the com
mandant's house, causing a white
Hag to be raised. Four hundred
Spaniards with arms, ioo who are
ill, ioo women and 400,000
rounds of ammunition were
handed over to Aguinaldo. These
soldiers were driven over to the
mainland by the insurgents.
When the American ships ap
peared in the bay the German
cruiser Irene slipped her cable
and sailed into Marivels. Five
German warships continue to cir
culate around the bay, keeping
two colliers at Marivels Bay.
Whatever may be the German

policy all the reports from Ma
nila agree that the Spaniards
have been greatly encouraged to
fight by the presence and actions
of the German squadron.
Aguinaldo has admitted that the Ger
mans and Spaniards made certain over
tures to him. The German warships
have taken a priest from Subig and the
Spanish sick from Olongapop to
Manila.
The situation otherwise is unchanged.
Admiral Dewey has been engaged in
putting his ships in complete order to
fight the Spanish reserve squadron.
General Anderson i? \ takinr* his ;. â¢ men
ashore and organizing them for ac
tive service as soon a.Â» the taking of
the city is desirable. The Spanish
steamer Filiqua, a fine merchant craft
of 1500 tons, was captured by the rebels.
General Aguinaldo announces he has
captured all the remaining Spanish
troops outside of Manila, numbering
3000. This is probably an exaggeration.
General Anderson a few days ago had
a lone: talk with Agriiinaldo. who asked,
him whether the United States intend
ed to assume the rights of sovereignty
over the Philippines. General Ander
son replied that he had no authority to
speak for the Government, but that xve
have been an independent nation for
122 years without having sought to ac
quire new colonies. General Aguin
aldo said he did not believe the United
States had such an intention. He had
read the constitution of the United
States carefully and could not find in
it a provision for colonial possessions.
He did not fear that we would occupy
the islands permanently.

CENSORED YET QUITE PITh|Y
itEW YORK, July 13. â Mr. Davis' dispatch was considerably muti
lated by military blue pencils before it reached the Herald office. The
following is all that the censor left of it:
WITH THE ARMY BEFORE SANTIAGO, via Playa del Este, July
12. â The arrival of the artillery', combined with the coming of General
Miles, has caused great rejoicing. In spite of the disma.l effect of a
hurricane every one knows that under General Miles, in the words of
OeWolf Hopper, there will be "less etiquette and more hustle"; that
there will be fewer processions of the white flag to ask how the ene
my feels now, and more shrapnel and bullets. General Miles' arrival
gives a new aspect to the situation. A feeling of certainty obtains
that there will be an end to all this long delay and message exchang
ing. As one of the Rough Rider cowboys said and gained the approval
of five miles of soldiers for saying it: "We have got those Mexicans
corralled now, why in hell * on't we brand them?"
K-rmt to anchorage off Manila without
saluting Admiral Dewey's finer, but
came down the next morning and
Baluted In due form.
The insurgents reported yesterday
(July 8) their intention of concentrat
ing troops for an assault upon Manila
July 12. The story cornea from head
quarters, but AguinaUlo is reticent.
American officers are inclined to credit
the report.
General Anderson has demanded the
quarters in Cavite occupied by Aguln
aldo's prisoners fur tht: use of the sec
ond expeditionary force from America.
The prisoners will be taken outside the
lines.
Native women who came through the
lines from Manila on July 7 said they
h. 1 b( en tortured by tho Spaniards
bpcause they would not give Informa
tion "f the strength of the American
forces.
There are no outward and visible
signs of alarm in Manila itself over
the arrival of V American transports.
The Spanish papers have a
Btatement that the Baltimore had
been towed to Hongkong for repairs.
The capture of General Monet's
troops had a very depressing effect on
the Spanish contingent. Monet's forces
are now living in peace and good will
with the natives of Bulacan village,
and I presume intend to support the
cause of Philippine independence.
It is reported that Monet's flight was
so precipitate that he left behind him
"') ho had acquired during the last
few months. The corrupt raising of
this sum caused a general rising in
Pampango Province, whose inhabitants
previously refused to rebel.
-\ few nijghts ago ISO native militia in
the trenches deserted. The Spanish
soldiers opened fire on the deserters
with B-centimeter field pieces and rifles.
The rebels, from their trenches, thought
the deserters were Spanish troops at
tacking in force, and they also opened
fire. Only five of the deserters reached
the rtbel ranks. Legarda, Aguinaldo's
tary, came to Manila with a flag
of truce on July 7. He visited Captain
General August!. A half hour's audi
ence was held behind closed doors.
When Legarda reappeared the Gov
ernor General accompanied him and
said at the door in Spanish: "You may
tell your chief, Aguinaldo, to go to the
devil."
He said Legarda had presented an
ultimatum, giving the Spaniards twelve
days to surrender. The defenses of the
city are being strengthened by sai:d
bags and trees. The crews of the
American ships and the American
troops are well.
WILL FOLLOW UP
THE ADVANTAGE
NEW YORK, July. 13.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
The administration is preparing to fol
low up the advantage gained by Rear
Admiral Dewey in successfully repell
ing what was probably the Initiative
Ft-p in German interference in the
Philippines.
It wants definite knowledge of the
exact position of the Berlin Govern
ment with reference to the Philippine
question, and t..e effort by the German
warship Irene to prevent the operations
of Insurgents against the Spanish
forces at Subig Bay will in all proba
bility be the lever employed to pry into
Emperor William's confidence. A copy
of Rear Admiral Dewey's dispatch re
lating to the Irene's strange behavicr
was laid before the President to-day by
Secretary Long, and Secretary Day,
who was subsequently acquainted with
its contents, took part In the discus
sion which followed. This is Rear Ad
miral Dewey's message:
"AguinaJdo informs me that his
troops have taken all of Subig Bay
ports except Isla Grande, which he was
prevented from taking by the German
man-of-war Irene. On July 7 the Ra
le! i:h and Concord went there. They
took the island and about 1300 men with
arms and ammunition. Xo resistance.
Tli - Irene retired from the bay on their
arrival. I shall send the Boston tc
Cape Enguano about July 16 to secure
another detachment. It is not practi
cable to send to Guam. No troop ves
sels available. DEWEY."
As a result of the discussion which
followed the receipt of the dispatch
then- la a .strong probability that the
Berlin Government will be officially in
formed of the incident, with a view to
obtaining from it an explanation "of
the peculiar conduct of the German
commander.
Germany has been well aware that
the United States did not look with
favor upon the assembling of such a
strong squadron as she now has lo
cated in the Philippines, although no
formal protest has been made and it is
not proposed officially to call attention
to this matter.
The authorities with whom I talked
to-day admitted that the retention of
five German warships in the waters of
the Philippines is must irritating.
"The Irene incident," continued one
of these gentlemen, "is an indication
of Germany's intention. Sublg Bay is
a magnificent harbor Just to the north
war.! of Manila Bay. You will recall
that Rear Admiral Dewey expected to
find Montejo's ships at that point and
explored the bay before proceeding to
Manila. Its possession would be wel
comed by the German Government. I
have an idea that the squadron is act-
Ing under no direct orders from Berlin,
but the comniandt-rs of vessels under
stand the desire of their Government
to^extend its colonial possessions.
"Had Rear Admiral Dewey not acted
as promptly and as properly as he did
I have no doubt that the Germans
would have considered the procedure
of the Irene as a precedent upon which
to base further action. To a certain
extent the insurgents are allies of the
United States.
"There has been no agreement be
tween Rear Admiral Dewey and the
Insurgents, and the American com
mander has so scrupulously observed
the proprieties that the natives can
not claim that they have been recog
nized either as allies or as belligerents.
But they have common cause with the
American forces in that they are fight
ing the same enemy, and it Is therefore
incumbent upon the UDited States to
KICHARD HARDING DAVIS.
see that their operations are not pre
vented in any way."
Among naval officers the belief pre
vails that the Germans will get more
significance out of Rear Admiral
Dewey's action in Binding a force suf
ficient to destroy the Irene than from
any diplomatic explanations that may
be demanded.
Upon the arrival of the monitors
Monterey and Monadnock at Manila
Rear Admiral Dewey will be in a posi
tion where he can resent any inter
ference on the part of Germany and
defeat the latter if it should precipitate
war. While the authorities will prob
ably not admit it. there is reason to be
lieve that the addition of the two
monitors to the fleet is intended to im
press Germany with the naval force of
this Government, and no doubt Is felt
by the officials that it will have the de
sired effect.
Some concern is felt by the officials
respecting-the t are of the 1300 men cap
tured by the Raleigh and Concord It
is presumed that they will be lodged at
Cavite and guarded by the American
troops. They will most certainly not
be turned over to the insurgent?. The
feeding of this number of men will t,e
a problem which Rear Admiral Dewey
will have to solve, but he reported the
arrival of a ship chartered in Aus
tralia with large sn--M?s of fresh meat
vegetables and coal, and this will keep
his fleet supplied for sonv* time to
come, while the prisoners will probably
be fed on ship's stores and food which
the army carried with it to Manila
GERMAN SHIPS
DOING RASH THINGS
LONDON, July 14.â The Hongkong
correspondent of the Daily Mail says:
General Aguinaldo declares that both
the Spanish and Germans have made
overtures to him, though he declines to
divulge their import. United States
Consul Wildman asserts that Admiral
Dewey could compel the sur
render of Manila to-morrow if
he desired. He says his dis
patches show that the Germans con
tinue to interfere, their action causing
much anxiety and it is said they are
assisting the Spaniards by landing flour
and other supplies, and, moreover, that
the German officers have been seen in
the Spanish trenches.
The Germans have not been careful
to observe the naval courtesies requir
ed by the situation. They have given
Admiral Dewey much annoyance by
insisting on sending their boats around
the bay after dark.
At the same time the German ad
miral informed AdmiraJ Dewey that he
had no intention of giving offense to
America and that his movements are
not to be construed as an 3' demonstra
tion of ill will. Admiral Dewey is said
to have replied: "Perhaps it would be
better If matters were irtanaged a little
differently."
The German ships have done and are
still doing rash and impertinent things,
like the Irene incident. The Americans
hope the Spaniards will continue their
waste of ammunition in fighting the
rebels and to surrender Manila without
bloodshed.
Admiral Dewey, on report that the
German fleet was landing, large quan
tities of rice and flour for the Span
iards, decided to be more strict and
has put a pin ace at the end of the
jetty to overhaul all launches going or
coming.
MANILA NOW IN A
FEARFUL CONDITION
LONDON, July 13.â The special cor
respondent of the Times at Cavite
writes as follows, under date of July 10,
via Hongkong:
"I arrived here on July 7. Admiral
Dewey and General Anderson received
me cordially and gave me quarters with
the officers of the Fourteenth Regular
Infantry. The American troops are a
fine-looking body of men, but the dis
cipline is easy and not at all compar
able to that of an English volunteer
corps. Their clothing is heavy for a
warm climate, and I fear the men will
suffer from heat should field operations
be necessary for the capture of Manila.
There are about 160 cases in the hos
pital, chiefly complaints caused by eat
ing fruit or drinking unfiltered water.
"A steamer arrived on the 9th from
Australia with 3000 frozen carcasses for
the American forces. The condition of
Manila is said to be terrible. It is hoped
the town will surrender without neces
sitating bombardment, but the Spanish
authorities are obstinate and a capitu
lation is not likely. The whole Ameri
can expedition is expected here by July
30. Admiral Dewey, whose attitude has
been particularly humane and lenient,
has now declared a complete blockade!
Yesterday he sent away the British
steamer Esmeralda, which wished to
take passengers for Hongkong. The
conduct of the Germans still causes
grave suspicions."

tively has given to Spain assurance

European powers in exercising pres

Philippines and in restricting- America

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JULY 14, 1898.
SANTIAGO MUST
SURRENDER OR
BE DESTROYED
This Is the Programme at Last
Decided Upon by General
Shafter.
Although Miles Has Not. Taken Command in
Cuba His Presence May Expedite
Matters.
Call Office, Riggs House, Washington, July 13.
The Cabinet has been again in session at the White
House this evening. All the members were present, and dis
patches from the front were laid before them. Unless the
city surrenders Santiago is to be taken at once to get the
United States forces into camp on the hills, where quarantine
regulations can be enforced.
WASHINGTON, July 13.â While the
long-expected fall of Santiago did not
take place to-day, it Is evident that the
crisis has been reached. Within the
next twenty-four hours it will either
surrender or receive such a baptism of
fire as seldom falls to the lot of a be
sieged town. "If he refuses I will open
on him at 12 noon to-morrow with
every gun I have, and will have the
assistance of the navy, who are ready
to bombard the city with 13-inch
shells."
That is the programme laid out by
General Shatter, and it is to be carried
out to the letter. General Shatter is
still in command, according to the War
Department officials, and although
dispatches have been received from
Major General Miles, signed major
general commanding, it is said that he
has not displaced General Shatter In
direct charge of the operations. The
public, in reference to these telegrams
from General Miles, was given the first
notice that our Government had of
fered, in the course of negotiations
with General Toral, to send the Span
ish forces in Santiago back to Spain.
A few days ago it was stated that
the President would insist upon uncon
ditional surrender, but it appears that
condition has been modified as indi
cated by General Miles. This was done
from a desire to avoid useless blood
shed, for with General Toral's army
removed Spain would be harmless to
prevent our further operations in Cuba
and this would serve as good a purpose
as would the destruction of the Spanish
army.
To allow the Spanish general to with
draw to the interior and fall back on
Havana, on the other hand, would put
us under the obligation of overcoming
that additional force when It comes to
the siege 6f Havana. Our Government
also is moved to make this proposal to
remove the Spanish forces to Spain
through a strong desire to close up the
operations at Santiago at the earliest
possible moment. This desire has been
materially strengthened by the appear
ance of yellow fever within the Ameri-
ITALY TO SEIZE
THE CARTAGENA
CUSTOM HOUSE
Sends a Squadron to Enforce
Payment of the Claim of
a Subject.
"WASHINGTON, July 13.â The State De- I
panmcnt has been notified that the Hal- \
ian Goveri.ment has determined to adopt j
force 1n the payment by the Republic of '
Colombia of the arbitration award )r.ade i
b.- PiteWent Cleveland In favor of Ern
esto CeiTUtt. an Italian citizen, amounting j
to $250,000. To this end the Italian Govern- |
metii has summarily closed diplomatic ne
gotiations with the Colombian Minister at
Rome, and has notified Admiral Candlani
to proceed with the Italian squadron to j
Cartagena, Colombia, and there adopt j
forcible means to collect the amount.
A dispatch from Caracas, Venezuela, an
nounces that the Italian squadron, under
Admiral Candiani, left La Guayra on
Monday for Cartagena, in order to seize
the custom-house there. The information
reaching the State Department Is to the
effect that the Italian squadron will ar
rive at Cartagena on the 14th (to-morrow)
and that it consists of four warships.
In view of the serious possibilities in
volved in the case, the United States
Government has sought to avert an imme
diate crisis. On the request of the Co
lombian authorities that the good offices
of the United States be exercised, word
was sent to our Charge d' Affaires at
Home, to make inquiry into the status
of the case. There appears to be no dis
position on the part of our Government
to interfere in such stepa as Italy may
take for the execution of the award, as
we are iirecluded from contesting an
award made by this Government, but at
the same time it is hoped that Italy may
be disposed to grant sufficient time to the
Suuth American republic to permit her
to pay the award without suffering the
indignity of a seizure of her chief com
mercial port.
As Italy's purpose is confined to the col
lection or the award and has no territorial
purposes in view, it is said that the Mon
roe doctrine has no application to the
Cflfee, lÂ»u t that It is governed by the rules
which applied to the British seizure of
Corlnto, when the British squadron occu
pied the custom-house until a claim of
|75.t)00 was settled.
The Cerruti case g-rows out of the poli
tical agitation in Colombia in IS.SS. At that
time Cerruti was at the head of a large
company doing business in Colombia.
During the rebellious period Cerruti was
imprisoned by one. of the political fac
tions, his personal property taken from
him and his business interests wiped out.
The case was first submitted to Spain
for arbitration, but the award was not
considered satisfactory and final. Later
the Italian Government and that of Co
lombia agreed by protocol on February
6, 1895, to submit the entire question to the
President of the United States. President
Cleveland accepted the duty, and, after
a lengthy consideration of the subject,
rendered his award on March 2, 1897, two
days before the expiration of his last
term. After disallowing the claims for
personal damages resulting from arrest
anci imprisunnu-nt. President Cleveland's
award for loss of individual property was
as follows:
"I award Â£60,000 sterling Cs3oo 0001 of
which sum Â£10,000 (J50.000) has been al
ready paid. The Goverment of the re
I can lines. It was at first supposed that
the men were falling 111 with malaria
and climatic fever, so the cases were
reported as simply suspicious. Now,
however, comes the final admission
that they are genuine yellow fever
cases. Their appearance has deter
mined the authorities upon a more ac
tive prosecution of the campaign.
Orders will s^on go forward to Shaf
ter to discuss no more with the Span
ish commander the terms of surrender,
but to proceed to assault the town
with, all the force at his command as
soon as the present truce expires. It is
expected by Shafter that the navy will
co-operate and while Secretary Long
has received no direct advices on that
point from Admiral Sampson he fully
credits this expectation. Reluctant as
the War Department is to sacrifice the
many lives that mieht be lost In as
sault, it is deemed to be the better
policy to make it than to allow the men
to rot away with fevers and other dis
eases during the long period that would
be required to perfect the reduction of
the city by steady investment. An ex
pectation is still entertained here, how
ever, that this assault will be unneces
sary through Toral surrendering before
It begins.
It was perhaps the spread of this be
lief caused by a knowledge of the more
energetic steps in prospect that tended
to remove largely the feeling of de
pression manifested with the opening
of the day upon the circulation of ru-
mors of the appearance of yellow fever
in the American camps. Regarding the
future of Santiago nothing had been
officially stated, but it is significant
that orders were Issued in the depart
ment this afternoon to prepare the
First and Second Regiment of Volun
teer Immunes for Immediate departure
for the front. This would seem to be
indicative of a purpose on the part of

with these fever-proof men after its
capitulation, thus permitting the re
moval of the regular troops to more
healthy points.
public of Colombia will, in addition, pay
to the Government of Italy for the use of
Senor Ernesto Cerruti Â£10,000 sterling
($50,000) then-of within sixty days from
thf date hereof, and the remaining Â£40,000
($200,000) within nine months of the date
hereof, with Interest from date at the
rate of 6 per cent per annum until paid,
both payments to be made by draft pay
able in London, England, with exchange
from Bogota at the t)me of payment."
Colombia declined to pay the amounts
awarded on the ground that the Presi
dent's decision was lacking in finality,
and left several questions open to doubt.
It was finally arranged that both govern
ments should make inquiry as to the
meaning of certain features of the
award. The inquiries were submitted to
this Government, but it led to no reopen
ing of the case, as the authorities here
evidently regarded President Cleveland's
finding as final. Thus the matter has
stood, until now Italy has determined to
abandon diplomacy and leave it with the
admiral of her squadron to collect the
money by ocupying the custom house of
Cartagena.
Cartagena is a city of 25,000 inhabitants
on the north or Atlantic coast of Colom
bia, almost due south of Santiago, where
the American fleet is now stationed. It
has a large commerce, most of the im
ports and exports of Colombia passing
through there. Colombia has no navy, its
own marine force being three small reve
nue cutters.
TO BE RELIEVED BY
AN ARMY OF IMMUNES
Begular and Volunteer Troops to Be
Protected Against Yellow
Fever.
NEW YORK, July 13.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: After
the surrender or capture of Santiago
de Cuba most of the regular troops will
be Immediately relieved by a large
army of immunes. The authorities de
sire to get the regular and volunteer
troops out of danger of yellow fever
as soon as possible. The immunes are
being organized and drilled and they
will be ready to go to Cuba very soon.
It will not be necessary to keep an
army as large as General Shafter's in
Santiago after its fall. The principal
work devolving upon the American
troops remaining in Cuba will be police
duty in supplying food and other neces
saries they lack to returning refugees.
Santiago is a hotbed for yellow fever.
Two regular negro regiments may be
left in Santiago, as they are consid
ered immunes. The Twenty-fifth Kegi
ment, which has been doing garrison
duty at Dry Tortugas, is to be ordered
to Santiago. The Twenty-fifth Infan
try is a negro regiment. There are ten
full regiments of immunes, mostly en
listed from the Gulf States, and many
of them are commanded by regular
army officers.

WITH THE ARMY BEFORE SANTIAGO, via
Playa del Este, July 13. â Taking the shape of a gig-antic
semicicrcle, the American army extends around Santiago for
eight miles and touches the bay on either side of the city.
General Lawton's division on the extreme right of the army
was pushed forward yesterday. It now practically rests upon
the shore of the bay west of Santiago. Our troops have oc
cupied the western suburbs, and are ready to dash into the
city itself.
The Spanish fell back sullenly before
our advance, and are retiring without
firing. The importance of the strength
ening of General Lawton's position is
now fully appreciated, and all the re
enforcements which are arriving are
being sent to his aid. This massing of
our troops on the right Indicates that
our final attack will be made th^re.
The Spanish lines are undoubtedly
weakest at that point, and the topog
raphy of the country is favorable for
the advance of the American troops.
Many of the advanced Spanish en
trenchments have already been aban
doned, for the firing of our troops
Saturday and Sunday made it too hot

From General Lawton's lines a clear
view of the harbor of Santiago may be
obtained. Large ships ride at anchor,
steamers He at piers and a torpedo
boat sometimes hurries over the land

General Garcia were formerly residents
of Santiago. They are familiar with
the fortified buildings of the city, as
well as its vunerable points. They
called attention to an ice factory and
an electric-lighting plant. Both have
been marked for destruction when tha

was cut off by the American troops the
ice factory has furnished fresh water,

Preparations for the final assault are

SPAIN WILL SUE
FOR PEACE WHEN
SANTIAGO FALLS
Sagasta Declares the Time Has
Arrived for Overtures to
That End.
Special cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 18'js, by James Gor
don Bennett.
MADRID, July 13.â 1 have no doubt
from what I hear this evening that the
Government is only waiting for the
fall of Santiago to ask for peace. Senor
Sagasta to-day, for the first time, said
that the moment for peace negotiations
had come. His words were, "What
other remedy have we?" Ministerial
organs speak only of peace. If San
tiago falls the Government has decided
to ask for an immediate suspension of
hostilities. Senor Correa, Minister of
War, would resign, and Lopez Domin
guez, Liberal, and a friend of Mo ret
and peace, would come in. It seems
to be the general consensus of opinion
that Sagasta should remain at the
helm with a modified Government.
This signiiicantly shows the view of
the situation taken by business men
here. To-day on exchange, when a tip
was circulated that Mario had reached
Santiago with reinforcements, the
Bourse went down, being interpreted
as a continuance of the war, but when
the report was contradicted home is
sues went up again.
Senor Sagasta declares that the peace
propositions attributed to President
McKlnley are Inadmissible.
El Epoca considers that a Carlist
movement is undoubtedly in prepara
tion, and urges upon the Government a
military occupation of the northern
provinces of Spain.
NEW YORK, July 13.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Secretary
Day to-day reiterated in most positive
terms his denial that peace negotia
tions, directly or indirectly, are in
progress between the United States and
Spain. It is said by administration of
ficials that interested persons in Eu
rope are giving out talk of peace more
because the wish is father to the
thought than for any other reason.
Aside from the existence of a pressure
upon the Madrid Government having
as its object the ending of the war the
authorities say they have no knowledge
of any movement toward peace. It is
positively asserted that no representa
tions whatever have been made to this
Government, and none will be enter
tained unless they come direct from
Spain.
LONDON, July 14.â The Madrid cor
respondent of the Times says: "There
is a mysterious change in the political
atmosphere. The fresh breeze which
set in two or three days ago in the di
rection of peace has for a moment sub
sided. The weather prophets tell us it
is merely a momentary lull, but they
do not explain on what their prediction
is founded."
The Lisbon correspondent of the
Daily Mail sayst "Owing to the proba
chances with Mauser bullets to facing
yellow fever in wet trenches. There
was a terrible rainstorm on Monday
night, followed by heavy soaking rains
yesterday and last night. Small
streams are swollen into rivers and
roads are almost impassable. The water
has swept away nearly all evidence of
the patient work of volunteers and
trebled the difficulty of getting artillery
to the front. What was comparatively
easy now requires an extraordinary ef
fort. Nevertheless, the men and horses
untiringly dragged the guns forward
after the storm ceased. The deluge
filled the trenches and converted them
into drainage ditches. Water was
everywhere. The men slept soaked to
the skin.
Wretched as were the troops, the ref
ugees were more wretched. Thousands
of these poor creatures were huddled
together at El Caney. Fully half of
them were absolutely without shelter.
Women and children lay for hours
upon the soaked earth. A drenching
rain made it impossible to light fires.
There came a rift in the clouds, and at
noon the sun appeared.
Positions for the new batteries were
selected by Randolph's chief of staff,
and the artillery in position was in
spected. The village of Caimenes, a
suburb of Santiago, was occupied by
our troops Monday.
General Toral has evidently with
drawn the greater part of his forces
into the city proper for the puropse of
resisting the main attack from the
trenches in streets and from loopholed
buildings. The main blockhouse just
outside the city has been destroyed. A
six-inch gun which the Spaniards were
using was disomunted and smashed to
flinders. The Spanish fire was poor.
Their shrapnel was old and useless,
and would not explode. It had evi
dently been lying in the arsenals for
years.

would be followed by a similar move

ernment is preparing to take energetic
measures, such as sending Portuguese
troops to the Spanish frontier and call

disorders in Spain."

LORD BBASSEY'S UNMISTAK
ABLE RESOLUTION.
Why the Most Cordial and Constant
Unity Should Exist Between
the Two Great
Nations.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, July 13. â The inaugural
meeting of the Anglo-American League
was held this evening at the Stafford
House, under the presidency of the
Duke of Sutherland. Among those
present were the Archbishop of Can
terbury, the Archbishop of York, Car
dinal Vaughn and the Duke of West
minster. The Duke of Fife sent a
letter expressing regret at his inability
to be present.
The Duke of Sutherland, in opening
the proceedings, said the league wag
quite apart from ordinary politics, it 3
object being to exnress the feeling of
cordiality which existed between the
people of Great Britain and the United
States.
On motion of Lord Brassey the fol
lowing resolution was adopted:
"Considering that the peoples of the
British Empire and the United States
are closely allied by blood, inherit tha
same literature and laws, hold the
same principles of government, recog
nize the sanio ideals of freedom and
humanity in the guidance of their na
tional policy, and are drawn together
by strong common interests in many
parts of the world, this meeting is of
the opinion that every effort should be
made in the interests of civilization
and peace to secure the most cordial
and constant co-operation on the part
of the two nations."
A representative executive council
was then appointed.
RED LETTER DAY FOR
THE AMERICAN NAVY
Account of the Naval Battle Off San-
tiago Taken From the Squad-
Ron Bulletin.
WASHINGTON, July 13.â A copy of
the squadron bulletin, which is pub
lished every day or so on the flagship
New York, has been received here and
gives the following account of the
naval fight at Santiago, under date of
July 3:
"This is a red-letter day for the
American navy, as dating the entire
destruction of Admiral Cervera's for
midable fleet, consisting of the Infanta
Maria Teresa, Vizcaya, OquenUo, .Cris
tobal Colon and the deep-sea torpedo
boats Furor and Pluton. The flagship
started from a station about 9 o'clock
to go to Siboney, where the admiral
had proposed going for a consultation
with General Shafter. When about a
mile from the bay the Spanish fleet
was observed coming out and making
westward. The flagship at once put
about to rejoin. The exit was remark
ably sudden and the pace sustained by
the enemy was such that the flagship
was more of a spectator than an actual
participant, having an opportunity ot
firing only at one of the torpedo-boat
destroyers. Though at no time close
enough to fire on the larger ships, there
was a fine view of the successive steps
of the victory and an opportunity of
forming one in the long and successful
chase after th<? Cristobal.
"It is of course much to be regretted
that we were not able to save anything
out of the general wreck. All but the
Cristobal Colon were total wrecks early
in the action, being fired by shells, run
ashore anrl blown up or injured. Th.;
Cristobal Colon was chased about sixty
miles until 1 p. m. The Oregon, Brook
lyn, Texas, Vixen and New York took
part in the order named, but toward
the last the Brooklyn drew somewhat
ahead and finally brought the Colon to
bay, when she was run ashore and sur
rendered. When boarded her bow was
in eight feet and her stern in seventy
feet of water. There was a consider
able quantity of water in the engine
room. Officers and men were sent from
the Oregon to take charge of her, but
she gradually sank, chiefly from all
her sea-cocks having been opened,
which our people were not able to get
at. It is probable that we may be able
to raise her. At least it is to be so
hoped."AGNEWS REEKS
WITH SCANDAL
fJTTfICHES ACCUSED
OF GRAVE OFFENSE
AGAINST MORALS
Charges Wtych if Confirmed Must
Result in an Official Cleaning
of the Institution.
SAX JOSE, July 12. â The management of Agnews
reeks with scandal. To-day there was the beginning of an
expose which seems likely to send more than one attache into
disgrace and out of authority. Some of the offenses men
tioned are almost unspeakable, and the aggregation shows
that the asylum has been run with an appalling laxness. Of
the people accused only one has yet had opportunity of mak
ing denial, and he did not avail himself of it. Later, each
will be given a chance to answer, and if the allegations shall
not be overthrown there is no escape from the conclusion
that the Agnews Asylum is a menace to morals, the execu
tive unfit for a place of trust, and some of the employes as
culpable as the head of the institution, while the directors
will be obliged to explain the whys and wherefores of many
an unsavory ep^ode.
Had the now famous Vesuvius
iflropi â  ot her "earthquake"
Bhella Into the meeting of the Board of
Managers of the Agnews State Hos
pital, better known as the Agnews In
f Asylum, th^ consternation among
the members present at to-day'B ses-
Blon would not have been greater than
was caused by the sensational charges
publicly made by two persons concern-
Ing persons connected with the institu
tion. Dr. Sponogle will have many
thins:? to explain.
So terrible and unexpected were the
accusations that they were met by that
tense silence which is more eloquent
than any words. But the faces of sev
eral of the members and attaches pres
ent Bhowed that the shafts had hit and
had penetrated deeply. Four people.
Including one of the female attaches of
isylum, were placed under fire, and
deal was scathing.
Frank H. Gould, ex-chairman of the
Democratic State Central Committee,
and would-be Caesar of the Democratic
j-arty. the grentleman who misses no op
portunity to pose as a great moral and
political reformer, who indulges himself
In the fond delusion that the guberna
torial lightning may be attracted to
him, was specifically charged with
bringing about the discharge of a fe
male attendant because she knew too
much to the detriment of Gould's half
brother. This man is employed as sec
retary to the medical superintendent of
the institution. Gould was further
charged with having done a gross
â wrong to the women whose silence he
could not enforce by unmanly threats.
I >r. F. 11. Sponogle, medical superin
â¢:t <>r" thÂ» asylum, was told In the
presence of the board that charges had
1 made airainst him of having mur
dered his first wife in order to secure
the insurance placed on her life; that
h" had ruined a young girl ir. Fresno,
and had paid $4000 to compromise the
matter. By another he was charged
With having made an unnecessary
physical examination of one of the fe
male attendants, to the lntter's deep
6hajne and against h*r pitiful protesta
tions. The latter charge was mad.- by
Charles Williams, who Is now the hus
band of the young woman in question.
It is this same young woman whose
d^char^rc Gould hrnucht about.
The story of alle^r-i murder and al
leged criminal assault was related by
Erwin Frost, well-known as a private
MRS. OLIVIA P. WILLIAMS.
(From a Photograph by Bushnell.)
detective of Santa Clara County. To
Frost's allegations Dr. Sponogle made
no explanation before the board and
maintained a stolid silence, despite a
most dramatic finale by Frost, such as
demanded instant reply.
When he had finished the list of
crimes which he declared had been laid
at the door of Dr. Sponogle, Frost ex
claimed:
"If those things had been said about
me, or if the man about whom th^y
were said had the least bit of manhood,
some one would be going around with a
shotgun looking for his traducers. or he
would turn the gun upon himself or
pack his grip and forever leave 'the
county of Santa Clara. Now, I say,
either that man has been most un
justly slandered or he is not fit to oc
cupy his position In this institution. If
I were in his place the least I would
do under the circumstances would be
to demand an immediate investiga
tion."
Everybody glanced uneasily about,
expecting some outbreak or attack
from Dr. Sponogle. but the rrran simply
kept his head bowed, listened and was
silent. In all the asnect of guilt.
As an offset to Mr. Williams' charge.
Dr. Sponogle claimed that he con
sidered nec^ssar" the examination he
made of Mrs. Williams, as she had
been suffering great pain, and he felt
it to be his duty to nttempt to relieve
her.
Later the doctor, on being asked if he
had anything to say relative to the
grave accusations made by Frost,
simply gave a general denial of all that
Fr"Ft had stated. This was made to
The Call's representative, but not to
the board.
Gould was not present at the meet
ing. It being given out that he was too
busy building fences at the Populist
convention at Sacramento to attend to
his duties as a State official.
Incidentally charges of immoral con
duct were made against T. T. Tour
tllotte, the half brother of Gould. His
relations with one of the female at
tendants, who subsequently proved to
be Mrs. K. Madigan. were alleged to be
closer than mere friendship would war
rant.
As the result of all these sensational
developments all that was done in the
matter by the board was to pass a mo
tion permitting Mr. Williams to file writ
ten charges at the next meeting of the
board, a month hence. Preparatory to
filing these charges Mr. Williams had
his wife make an affidavit to-day that
is given herewith. It gives the facts in
connection with her discharge on the
motion of Gould, after Gould had trkd
and failed to induce her to keep silent
relative to the conduct of Tourtilotte
and Mrs. Madigan.
THE SAN FBAXCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JULY 14, 1898.
MRS. WILLIAMS DISMISSED
BECAUSE OF "HALLUCINATIONS."
Ol I via Barnhieel-WilHams, the undersigned, being first duly sworn, deposes and says:
That she is a resident of the town of Santa Clara, county of Santa Clara. State of California.
That she entered the employ of the State as an attendant at the Agnews Insane Asylum about seven
years ago, and that her services had always been appreciated and her conduct approved by the officials of
that institution.
That without good cause or reason she was discharged in March, IS9R, from her position, which was
then head night watch in the female department, by formal vote of the board of managers of the Agnews In
sane Asylum.
That she believes that her dismissal was the result of her having knowledge of certain acts of two of the
employes of the institution, which were serious violations of good moral conduct, and which made them unfit
to hold their respective positions.
That the persons refprred to are T. T. Tourtillott, secretary to the medical superintendent, and Mrs. K.
Madigan, head attendant in one of the female wards.
That she conveyed her knowledge to Dr. J. N. Christal, one of the staff of physicians of the institution,
who, she has reason to believe, informed Dr. Sponogle, medical superintei dent.
That sh^ also informed Frank Gould, one of the members of the board of managers, by letter of the im
moral* conduct that she had reason to believe was being indulged in by Mr. Tourtillott and Mrs. Madigan,
and asked him to endeavor to correct them in their behavior at the asyl'-'n, as such conduct placed her in
an embarrassing position, both personally and in her relations to the bo rd.
That at one of the regular meetings of the board of managers, prior to her discharge, Mr. Gould sought
and obtained a private interview with her, and informed her that it was necessary for her to maintain silenre
in reference to Mr. Tourtillott, who is a half-brother of Mr. Gould; that he (Gould) had always been her friend;
that she owed her position to him, and that if she did not maintain the strictest silence in reference to the
Tourtillott-Madigan matter he would give her a "hasty walk down the avenue with her grip."
Thnt she answered: "I am not responsible for the conduct of your brother. It is common talk about the
building the way he has carried on with Mrs. Madigan. It is no fault of mine that the matter has grown
serious."
That Mr. Gould responded that he had investigated the matter and believed, on the statement of his
brother, that his brother and Mr?. Madigan were innocent. He added: "You may say that my brother and
Mrs. Madigan are guilty of immoral conduct, but, personally, I don't believe it."
That at the meeting immediately following this interview between the deponent and Mr. Gould the lat
ter moved that the deponent be summarily dismissed on the ground that she was a nervous wreck and was
subject to mental hallucinations; which motion was duly carried without any investigation and without afford
ing tho deponent any opportunity to say anything in her own behalf.
That this affidavit is made in order to facilitate the investigation which the board of managers at its
meeting held July 13. IS9B, decided to institute at its next regular meeting In order to ascertain the facts in
connection with the charges made by the deponent against T. T. Tourtillott and Mrs. K. Madigan.
That the names of other witnesses who can testify to the facts as stated herein are Miss Ella Royce, for
tnerly matron at the asylum; Mrs. White, head attendant in one of the wards of the asylum; F. P. Kerns,
head night watch at the asylum; Miss Rose Ryan, an attendant at the asylum.
MRS. OLIVIA B. WILLIAMS.
Subscribed and sworn to before me this 13th day of July, 1898.
[Seal] I. S. THOMPSON, Notary Public in and for Santa Clara County, State of California.
Enough was developed at the short
and exciting session of the morning,
however, to warrant the intervention
of the Governor to the extent of seeing
that the internal affairs of Agnew?
Asylum are thoroughly sifted, and the
blameworthy exposed and- punished.
This was the day set by the board for
the opening of bids for new cottages to
be built for the institution. The bids
were opened and the award made to
Mr. Davis at $15,500. Before proceed
ing to other routine business Mr. Frost
was asked if he wished to address the
board. He said that he did, and that
it would take him but a few minutes.
Ho declared that he had been denounc
ed before the board by John Griffith
as a blackmailer. He thought he
ought to have been asked to come be
fore the board to answer the charge
made by Griffith. He understood, he
said, that Griffith had said that he
(Frost) had shown Griffith a typewrit
ten document, which was to be used to
blackmail Dr. Sponogle. Frost denied
that he had any intention of blackmail
ing any one, and th^n launched out
unexpectedly as follows:
From what has come to my knowl
edge I want to say this: Dr. Spo
nogle ought to demand an investiga
tion, or take his little gripsack and
leave Santa Clara County. Either
the doctor has been defamed, or he is
not fit to be at the head of this insti
tution.
Dr. J. R. Curnow here asked a start
ling question of Frost in a way to show
that he had received some previous in
formation on the matter mentioned.
"Have you heard of any bribe money
being offered by anybody in this in
stitution?" was his interrogatory.
"I promised not to mention the mat
ter," replied Frost, "but as you ask the
question, I will say that I have been
told that Dr. Sponogle gave a certain
man $200 to prevent that gentleman's
wife from being present at this meet-
Ing."
Charles Williams, the Husband of the
young woman, who is said to have been
discharged at the instigation of Frank
H. Gould, was requested to formulate
any request that he had to make. He
stated that he appeared on behalf of
his wife, nee Barnbisel.
"My wife," he Bald, "was let out
here some months ago. The motive
which brought about her discharge was
that she had certa'n information det
rimental to this board, and they tell
me that my wife is a nervous wreck,
and that she was laboring under a
mental hallucination. I have made a
very careful Investigation of her con
dition and if I am married to a ner
vous wreck I have not discovered it.
"She has told me that one morning it
was her unfortunate experience to have
seen the medical superintendent's sec
retary come out of a room in the other
end of the building, and I have a num
ber of witnesses and evidence to bring
before this board in relation to a cer
tain woman. This matter has been
talked about throughout the build
ing, and has given a black eye to this
place. My wife reported the matter to
Mr. Gould and also to Dr. Sponogle.
The latter said that the matter was so
important that he felt it was his duty
to report It to Mr. Gould, which I un
derstood he did.
"But Mr. Oould sa,id she was simply
being mnde a tool by some one who
wished to injure his brother, Mr. Tour
tilotte."
At this Juncture O. A. Hale, one of
the members of the board of manners,
objected to any charges being made
against an absent member, referring
to Oould.
Mr. Williams stnted that he was sim
ply trying to give the facts that
brought about the discharge of his
wife, and said he thought he had a per
fect right to do this. He then con
tinued:
"My wife believes that she was dis
charged because she -elated a matter
that was entirely true, but which was
against the interests of certain parties
here. I don't believe you gentlemen
would have discharged her If you had
known the facts. I believe she was dis
charged from malicious motives. In
behalf of my wife and in the interest of
fairness. In the" interest of good mor
als. I don't see why my wife should
have been discharged."
Edward White, another member of
the board, here asked: "In case this
board does not put your wife back, do
you Insist on an investigation as to her
dipchnrge?"
To this Williams replied: "I shall In
sist on a thorough investigation of all
the matters that led to her discharge.
I have the evidence of the immoral con
duct of some of the persons here, and
I think it should be placed before the
board."
Mr. Hale again Interrupted to ask
Mr. Williams to correct his statement
that his wife was maliciously dis
charged. Mr. Hale said that the board
did not act out of malice.
Mr. Williams modified his statement
on this point by saying that he knew
the board acted on the recommendation
of one of the members of the board
(meaning Mr. Gould), because she had
discovered Gould's brother in a com
promising position. Mr. Williams then
asked that his wife be reinstated in her
former position.
Chairman Curnow of the board re- !
marked that he understood that she r
had complained of not having been
properly treated while at the Institu
tion, and said he could not understand
why she should endeavor to place her
self again in a position which might
prove distasteful to her. "Why does j
she say that Dr. Sponogle had not acted
rifftit toward her?" he concluded.
"Dr. Sponogle did subject my wife to
'a physical examination," said Wil
liams, "but he says that it was for the
benefit of her health."
Williams also credited to Dr. Spono
; gle a remark concerning Mrs. Williams
such as will not bear publication.
Dr. Sponogle made no denial a.s to
the remark, but claimed that Mrs. Wil
liams, who was Miss Barnhisel at the
time referred to, was suffering great
pain which he wanted to relieve.
Hale again came to the rescue of the
man under fire.
'If these statements." he said, "are
in the nature of charges they should be
heard before the whole board and the
charges should be in writing."
Williams made retort to this as fol-
lows:
"I don't think this board will ever
come to the point where an investiga
tion will be made."
This Induced Mr. White to again ask
Williams if he would demand an in
vestigation if liis wife were not restored
to her former position. On receiving
a reply in the affirmative he made a
motion that Mr. Williams be given an
opportunity to be present at the nÂ«xt
meeting of the hoard to make a state
ment of his ca.se.
Mr. White said that a $rery serious
accusation had been made against an
employe of the asylum. "it is not
proper," he added, "that a report
should go abroad that Mr. Turtillott is
under suspicion, and if he is guilty he
should be discharged."
White's motion was 'adopted.
Frost again came to the front and

fired the moat demoralizing shot of the
session thus:
Dr. Sponogle has been accused of
murdering his first wife, and obtain
ing the insurance money that he had
placed on her life. He has been ac
cused, also, of ruining a young girl
in Fresno and of paying Â§4000 to get
out of the consequences of his act. If
he has a spark of manhood in him he
will demand an investigation of this
matter. He has either been vilified
or he is unfit to occupy the postiion
he now fills in this institution.
It was then he reached a climax by
declaring that Dr. Sponogle ought
either to be out gunning for his tra
ducers or making tracks for parts un
known.

GOVERNOR GENERAL
BLANCO ATTEMPTS
TO COMMIT SUICIDE
At Least That Is the Story Taken
to Key West by a Refugee
From Havana.
Fearful Conditions Now Prevail at the Cuban
Capital and Many Are Dying From
Starvation.
KEY WEST, l'la., July 13.âAccord
ing to advices from Havana received
here to-day. Governor General Blanco
attempted to commit suicide when he
learned beyond doubt that Admiral
Cervera's squadron had been anni
hilated. The earlier misleading dis
patches, which gave the impression
that Cervera had eluded the American
fleet, caused the ereatest joy in Ha
vana, but when the truth became
known, with meager details showing
the utter destruction of Cervera's
squadron, all gayeties were stopped and
every public and many private build
ings were hung with crape and other
black draperies.
Blanco was in the palace when the
intelligence reached him, and he be
came almost frenzied. He was closeted
with his staff and General Arolas of
the Spanish forces, discussing the
news, when he made the attempt on
his life. After a struggle he was sub
dued and disarmed, but the shock was
so severe that he was prostrated and
compelled to keep to his bed for sev
eral days. When he arose his first
order was to prohibit any food sup
nlles leaving Havana for interior
towns, where the distress is most
j poignant and where many are starv
ing daily.
This and other valuable information
was brought by Jose Pauline Blanco,
who indignantly repudiated a sugges
tion of kinship with the Governor Gen
eral. He says he is a loyal Cuban and
' escaped to avoid the necessity of fight
! ing against his cause as every male in
| the island who is able to bear arms is
! being pressed into the Spanish sen-ice.
: He obtained a fisherman's permit to go
: outside Morro and at 6 o'clock Monday
morning put off in a small boat. The
' United States gunboat Bancroft was
i stationed six miles out and he rowed to
'] her, the Cojimar batteries, east of Ha
! vana, firing two shots at him when he
was observed passing beyond the pre
scribed limits. The Bancroft trans
ferred him to another vessel and he was
'â  brought here, where the local junta
will care for him. The sailors of two
American ships made up a liberal
money subscription for him and gave
i him some new clothing.
ANOTHER
DIVORCE
SENSATION
William T. Plunkett Is
the Defendant.
LENGHTY LIST OF CHARGES
COMPLAINT TELLS A STORY OF
CRUELTY.
The Vacillating Husband, the For
giving Wife and a Num
ber of Letters in
Evidence.
A divorce complaint was filed yesterday
with the County Clerk, in which Cora B.
Plunkett Is the plaintiff and William T.
Plunkett the defendant.
Both parties are well known in San
Francisco, especially the defendant, who
was at one time a football player. of un
excelled reputation. He is a graduate
of the University of California, class of
1596, with a record In the field of scholar
ship as Well as on the gridiron.
The plaintiff is the daughter of Norman
Parrish, a prominent milling man of this
city and at present proprietor of the Cali
fornia Mills.
The complaint teems with sensational
matter. A list of charges is brought
against the young athletic husband, who,
according to the complaint, has so sinned
against the sanctity of the marital re
lations that there are several causes for
djvorce.
The married life of William T. Plunkett
and Cora Parrish has not been a long one.
They were married on October 6, 1597. not
a year ago. and three months after the
date of their union differences arose
which have now terminated in an abso
lute rupture and which the courts are
now called upon to decide.
The complaint recites how the husband
persuaded his wife to visit her mother In
San Jose. From the Garden City the
trusting woman sent missive after mis
sive to the erring husband, but he was
silent. Tortured by his neglect she came
to the city and attempted to find him.
They were then living at the Falrmount
Hotel, and she waited for his return in
rooms contiguous to her own. Plunkett
came home, but he was not responsive to
his wife's knocking for admittance. He
finally came out in the hall, but refused
to talk with his wife or explain why he
had sent their common personal, property
to her mother's home during her ab
sence. But he so far relented as to ap
point an hour for conference, which, as
the complaint reads, was productive of
tears and a temporary penitence. He
left his wife in harmony and peace to at
tend his classes in the night school of
which he was a teacher. Mrs. Plunkett,
joyful over the reconciliation, waited for
him when his school duties should have
been completed for the night, but was
met with a rebuke that drove her back
âº upon her parents. In the few hours be
tween the short-lived reconciliation and
the next meeting the husband had re
canted.
The story told In the complaint ex
poses a man crammed with the spirit of
vacillation. Repentance followed this act
of harshness at the end of this short
shrift penitence. The very next night the
ex-football player wrote to his wife to
return home, and she and her father ar
ranged for a meeting to discuss the mari
tal infelicities in all their ramifications.
For the second time the husband re
gretted his overtures of peace, and in a
deliberate and studied letter, in which he
analyzes his feelings, he tells his wife
that their paths of life would better di
verge and not Intersect. There is an
other letter in the complaint which shows
the plaintiff in the repentant mood. It
Blanco says the living conditions In
Havana are constantly growing worse,
the greatest distress necessarily failing
on the Cubans, because nearly all the
food is seized for the troops. Of these
there are about 70,000 In the city, con
sisting of volunteers, mobilized troops,
militia and regulars. Their rations are
largely rice and beans, without even
bacon. Jerked beef, Blanco says, sells
for 30 cents a pound, bread of poor
quality for 50 cents, lard SI. meat 75
cents, cornmeal 25 cents and rice 50
cents. Shark food is eagerly sought
and the day before Blanco left the city
one shark caught in Havana harbor
sold for $13 50.
The concentrados who have sufficient
influence with the dispensing authori
ties sometimes contrive to get one
wretched meal a day, but the others
starve, and it Is no uncommon thing,
Blanco says, to see persons drop dead
in the streets. Even among the Span
lards starvation is rapidly sapping their
loyalty, and large numbers of men are
banding themselves together, awaiting
the first American attack on Havana
as a signal of revolt. The grocery and
provision stores are empty, and the
only articles on the Havana wharves
are about a thousand barrels of ce
ment, wet and useless. Only liquor is
to be had cheaply.
Work on the defenses continues with
tireless vigor. Two line 3of cables
bearing torpedoes have been strung
across the harbor from â¦he city aide
to Morro Castle, and the 6ame has been
done in the Bay of Mariel, where, It
was reported in Havana, American
troops ure to be landed.
Blanco further reported that three
weeks ago the Spanish steamers Monte
video and Santo Domingo crept out of
the harbor at midnight with all lights
out and safely got through the block
ade. The Spanish ships now in the
harbor, he says, are the gunboats
Conde Venadito, Marquise de la En
senada, Neuva and Pana. Filiplnas
and Nunez Pinzon, several of which are
unfit for service. The guns have been
removed from the cruiser Alfonzo XII
and used for shore batteries and the
cruiser has been converted into- a hos
pital ship. There are also in the harbor
a number of smaller warships of the
nature of converted yachts.
The merchant steamers Josefa, Adola
and Maria Herrera are also in the har
bor.
was an incessant jumping from the black
to the white keys.
But this is not all of the sensational
matter in the complaint. It Is allege*
that the father of Airs. C. Plunkett called
on the husband at his hotel and found
another woman In h?s room; which affair
the defendant aver? was entirely Inno
cent, as the lady was only assisting him
packing his trunk.
After this another reconciliation was ef
fected. And then came the period of
greatest suffering for the wife. During
this time she alleges that her husband
treated her in a shameful and brutal
manner, the results of which are severe
mental and physical distress.
Mr?. Plunkett prays for dissolution of
the marriage, a resumption of her maiden
name and alimony.

PEOPLE'S PARTY DISAPPEARS
DOWN DEMOCRACY'S THROAT
JAMES G. MAGUIRE
NAMED TO HEAD
ITS STATE TICKET
Wins prom Sharjahao by a Vote
of 154 to 135 After a Bit
ter Contest.
HON. JAMES G. MAGUIRE.
SACRAMENTO, July 13.â The Peo
ple's party of xh<- State of <\tlifornia
has seen proper to step out of its own
ranks, and, by a vote of 156% to 135%,
nominate for Governor James G. .Ni.i
guire, th.-- Democratic Congressman.
The culmination of to-day's pn â 
inc< was entirely unlooked for two
hours before the vote was taken, and
was due to two causes â the clever man
agement of the Democratic committee
that tame up from Han Francisco hist
night and a speech by Judge Phillips
of Los Angeles, the newly elected head
of the Silver Republicans, before the
convention this morning. When the last
Populist sought his bed long after mid
night the situation, from a fuslonist
standpoint, was in a most chacriic state.
Thfy were split on three propositions,
and there was every indication that
they were so hopslessly tangled that
they would never be able to reach an
agreement. Kven thf Democrats, upon
whom they had relied to get them out
of the snarl, were divided among them
selves. A few favored the unequivocal
Indorsement of Maguirf, but the ma
jority urged that the head of the Popu
list ticket be left open until after the
Democratic convention had been held
and then have the Democratic nominee
indorsed by the Populist State Com
mittee.
The. . middle-of-the-roadsters were
Jubilant over the outlook and boldly
asserted that Maguire's name would
not even be mentioned before the as
semblage. But they were dealing with
men out of their own faith and far
more skilled in the game of politics,
and while they slept the men who were
to effect their annihilation were at
work.
The first thing to be done by the
Democrats was to sink all differences
among themselves and it wt:s agreed
that fusion was the main thing. If
the fusion Populists would consent to
leave the head of their ticket open, well
and good; but if they insisted upon
nominating Maguire, the Democrats
would magnanimously warrant them
that privilege.
Chairman Alford and his associates
had already yielded to Wardall and his
crowd in the matter of John W. Mit
chell participating In the conference,
and they would yield more if neces
sary-
And, speaking of Mitchell, while that
gentleman did not participate in the
conference last night, h>-> was on hand
bright and early this morning and join-
of the two com-
Ed In the
mittees.
After granting these concessions the
Democrats proceeded to get the fusion
ists in line. It would not do for any of
them to appear too openly in the con
vention, so they hit on the plan of
Bending Judge PhillipÃ to the front as
a Silver Republican. No wiser move
could have been planned. Judge Phil
lips is a shrewd and elnq Ue nt stump
speaker â much better than anybody
the Populists could muster â with a
vein of humor and a free, open manner
well calculated to catch such a crowd,
â¢which, in truth, was quite willing to be
caught.
When the convention was called to
order this morning it was proposed to
have Judge Phillips address the gather
ing. The middle-of-th^-roadpters ob
jected, but the majority were pleased
to listen to the oratory of somebody
other than themselves, and the Judge
was escorted to the chairman's desk
and Introduced as the new leader of the
great reform j - -*- that is working
' hand in hand with themselves, the ,
Silver Republicans. \ t
Judge Phillips proceeded at once to ( (
place himself en a friendly footing with (
his hearers and get them into good
humor. He succeeded admirably, and i ,
before he had spoken five minutes hÂ« :
had fusioniÃta and middle-of-the
roadsters cheering him wildly. Then ]
h proceeded to recount the misdeeds '
of the Republican party which caused
him and his followers to break away,
and pictured th<- common purpose of
'â  the three so-called reform parties.
Skillfully he led his hearers on. care- j :
I fully avoiding all reference to any one ;
I candidate, but always holding up the '
i certainty of defeat unless a union of j .
. the three forces was effected.
It was a clever effort and It won. i
Judge Phillips was tendered a unanim
ous vote of thanks and left the conven- i
j tlon with the fusion faction again in j
fighting trim. But even then they were j
â  fur from being united on a plan of pro- j
I cedure, and had the anti-fusionists !
numbered one man who was competent i
1 to take up th* leadership on the floor !
their defeat might have been averted, i
: But Cator, who' had been the recipient
[ ! of a savage though covert onslaught at
the hands of Judge Phillips, seemed to :
lose his grip and let matters go by the !
' ' board. To he sure, he rallied during j
' ! recess and called the Los Angeleno '
I down in vigorous fashion, but during
! the afternoon he took no part in the
â¢ alignment of his forces other than to
1 deliver two Bjpeeches in open ''nnven
, i tion, which were by all odds quite the
' beat bits of Populistfc oratory heard !
i during the convention.
1 ' After Phillips' speech, Gillesple of \
! San Francisco submitted the report of i
i | the committee on rules and permanent j
. i organization. There was a minority re
' port and a bad parliamentary tangle,
â¢ i which terminated after much wasted
; I energy in a vote to lay the minority on i
: ' the table. It was lost by a vote of 75 to
! 74, a victory for the anti-fusionists. The
. others would not have it. however, and |
' ! demanded a roll call, and the motion
! ! was carried by a vote of 153 to 188, a
' i decided gain for the middle-of-the
f i roadster? over the vote for chairman
> i yesterday.
I ; They seerred to rally pome at this
j showing, but the Democrats were sta
1 ! tioned in an ante-room, where they
5 i were conducting the proceedings on be
i j half of the furionists. and did not let
them get much further.
The appointment of a committee to
I confer with the Democrats concluded
the morning Bepslon, the fusionists hay
' ing succeeded in preventing any report
, ! by the committee on order of business,
- | beyond effecting a permanent organiza
tion by the retention of the temporary
I officers, even the resolution providing
1 i for the nomination of Governor being
s held up for the time being.
1 ] During recess caucuses and confer
. | ences were held on all sides. The fu-
Bionists met In the Senate chamber, the
' middle-of-the-roadsters in the Supreme
Court chamber and the joint committee
c of Democrats and Populists in the As
- ( sembly chamber. The only ones to ac
f [ compllsh anything were the joint com
i mitee. They prepared a report, which
', : they discreetly held back until they
could make an attempt to force a vote
s | on Governor, secret orders going out
c from them for such a move. The fu
- sionists, with their safe majority, could
p not a^ree upon a plan. Fur a time
they canvassed the situation with open
doors, some favoring the straight nonii
a nation of Miiguire, while others con
r | tended for the old plan of leaving the
1, i head of the ticket open. Wardall pro
e I tested against this on the ground that
if the convention adjourned without
o ! making any nomination the vacancy
o ' could not be filled afterward. He said
- It would be far preferable to put up a
'- dummy ticket and let the nominees re
â l sign later and then their places could
y be filled by the State Committee.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JX T LT 14, 1898.
PEOPLE'S PARTY PLATFORM
ADOPTED AT SACRAMENTO.
<
The People's party of the State of California, realizing the urgent necessity of reform In State and nation, re-
affirm our convictions in the principles enunciated In our national platform.
Recognizing that the initiative and referendum will assure government by the people, we therefore demand an i
amendment to the Constitution providing: <
Firstâ That any law or ordinance adopted by any legislative body of this State shall be subject to a popular vote ,
when demanded by a properly authenticated petition signed by a reasonable pc â  cent of the electors of the Stale, (
county or municipality, as the case may be, and if Bucn vote shall show a majority against the law or ordinance, it
shall be invalid.
Secondâ That upon petition of a reasonable per cent of the elector* of the State, county or municipality, as the I
case may be, the respective legislative bodies shall submit to the electors therein any Question the submission of ,
Which has been demanded by such petition or shall submit to them for their approval a law, a constitutional amend- (
ment or an ordinance containing such provisions as may have been demanded by such petitioners.
Thirdâ When legislation has been adopted as herein provided by the people, no legislative body shall have the right
to nullify such action without the consent of the people given at the polls, and such action by the people shall be im- I
peratlve and not subject to veto. i
We demand the free and unrestricted coinage of silver and gold at the present legal ratio of 16 to 1, without waiting (
for the aid or consent of any other nation, and we are unalterably opposed to the policy of the Republican party in
demanding the retirement of greenbacks and the surrender to national banks of the sovereign power of issuing money;
and we especially denounce the avowed attempt of said party to fasten upon the country irrevocably and forever the
single gold standard. v . {
We demand a national money safe and sound, issued by the general Government only, without the intervention or
banks of Issue,- to be a full legal tender for all debts, public and private; also, a just, equitable and efficient means of dis
tribution direct to the people through the lawful disbursements of the Government.
We demand that the volume of circulating medium be speedily increased to an amount sufficient to meet the de
mands of the growing buelness and population of the country and to restore the just level of prices of labor and produc-
We demand such legislation as will prevent for the future the demonetization of any kind of legal tender money by
private contract.
We demand that the Government, in payment of its obligations, shall use its option as to the kind of money in
which they are to be paid, and we denounce the present and preceding administrations for surrendering this option to
the holders of Government obligations.
' We demand that there shall be no further issue of United States interest-bearing bonds.
We demand that postal savings banks be established by the Government for the safe deposit of the savings of the
people and to facilitate exchange.
We oppose all funding bills calculated to extend the time for payment of the Pacic Railroad debt, and we de
mand that our Government take the necessary steps to immediately foreclose its mortgage upon the Central Pacific
Railroad and collect the debt in full, and, if necessary, to bid it in at the sale and operate the same in the interest and
fur the benefit of the people.
We demand the construction, ownership and operation of a ship canal across the Isthmus of Nicaragua by the United
States Government or private corporation.
The war against Spain, compelled by the sentiments of the people of the I'nited States in vindication of honor,
duty, humanity and liberty, should be prosecuted with an overwhelming vigor until the neds for which it was undertaken
have been fully and satisfactorily achieved.
We deprecate the fact, however, that In order to raise means to prosecute this war unjust and unequal systems of
taxation have been adopted by the Republican Congress and administration, by which wealth is enabled to escape Its
just burdens, shifting the same to the shoulders of those less able to bear them.
We further deprecate the fact that interest bearing bonds have been issued, w,hlch, although miscalled a popu
lar loan " will absorb the product of toil for years to come, and greatly add to the burdens of the producing classes.
We demand a reform in our system of taxation, to the end mat taxes shall so be laid as to secure as far as pos
sible equality of sacrifice We favor th<- repeal of n!l poll taxes and demand exemption from taxation of small home-
Bteads and personal property, the amount to be fixed by the Legislature. We also favor a graduated State, Income
and inheritance tax. We also favor the submission to the people of a constitutional amendment which will give to
counties and municipal corporations the right to adopt such a system of taxation for local purposes as the people of
such locality may desire. , it _ ,
Labor being the support of life, the right to work Is as sacred as the right t to live. Review the ever-increasing
growth of the army of unemployed wage-earners as a discredit to our civilization and a menace to the republic, and we
favor such legislation as shall tend to secure remunerative employment for every citizen.
We demand the election of United Senators by a direct vote of the people.
We oppose judicial legislation and government by Injunction.
We demand the public ownership of public utilities and favor the passage Of such laws and constitutional amend
ments as will facilitate their acquirement.
And to the support of this platform we pledge each and every candidate nominated by this convention.
minutes-Just long enough to receive
Instructions from the managers, men
the convention reassembled.
It was considerably after 3 o clock,
and the prospects were thnt the day j
would be wasted. The first sign of ac
tivity came when the committee on
platform and resolutions presented its
report. The platform proved to be as
ardent a Populist document as the
staunchestmiddle-of-the-roadster could j
desire, and it was adopted without a
dissenting vote.
This was followed by calling up that
part of the order of procedure that was
temporarily laid aside in the morning,
providing for the nomination of Gover- \
nor which was adopted. Then Cator
forced the crisis the fusionists were
watching for by offering the following
resolution:
Resolved, that no person shall be elig- I

any place on the State ticket, unless he :
s)i;tll iirst appear before the convention in i
person and accept the platform adopted.
and if he be absent, the platform shall be â 
telegraphed- him for acceptance by lmme- j
diate answer.
Cator supported his resolution with
a fiery speech in which he touched upon j
his relations with Judge Magulre, as- |
serting that their differences were en- ]
tirely due to divergent political views. \
Gator proceeded to ventilate Maguire's i
opinions and actions in Congress, and !
was making it intensely tropical for the j
! Congressman, when he was choked off j
by the chairman at the behest of the
, fusionists.
There was a great uproar over Ca
tor's speech, and his opponents sought
to kill his resolution by recounting the
cost of transmitting the entire plat
form to New York, where Maguire now
is. and the probable delay, which might
hold the convention in session several
days longer. The middle-of-the-road-
Bters rallied to Gator's support and bit
terly denounced their opponents for
their un-Populistic conduct in placing
an outsider at the head of the ticket
without even knowing whether he
would indorse their platform.
But by this time the fus'onists were
firmly planted in the saddle and deter
mined to ride rough shod over all ob
stacles. Cornell led the opposition to
Cator's resolution, while Dittmar of
Shasta supported it. Giilespie alluded to
Cator as a prevaricator and branded
the latter's statements as "unquali
fledly false." He launched forth into
a eulogy of Maguire and denunciation
of Shanahan, that being the first time
that gentleman's name had been men
tioned. Gillespie's allusions were much
more personal than Cator's had been,
yet the chairman permitted him to con
tinue, with the admonition not to call
any names. Cator maintained dignified
silence. Mason offered a substitute
resolution as follows:
Resolved, that the chairman and secre
tary be directed to refuÃe to certify to the
nomination of any nominee of this con
vention until such nominee shall first de
clare his belief in th* principles of this
party, which ure stated to be:
Iâ Direct legislation.
2â Opposition to the gold standard with
all that It implies.
3â Public ownership of public utilities.
4- Reform in taxation as stated in <>ur
platform and that such nomination shall
be made subject to such condition, and In
case of a refuaion to so declare in writ
ing that such nomination shall be de
clared vacant.
The roll call showed the adoption of
the resolution by 1B!> ayes to 12G noes.
Other resolutions were piled in thick
and fast, but they were of little or no
interest or bearing on the matter, and
the delegates were growing tired and
fast losing their patience. The action
of Gillesple and his fellow fusionista in
seeking to force Maguire down their
throats without even waiting for him
to reply to Mason's resolution indors
ing the principles of the platform, dis
gusted many liberal fusionists, and had
there been anybody to make a deter
mined fight for adjournment then, or
even after the candidates had been
named, and before the vote was taken,
the middle-of-the-roadsters could have
carried their point and fusion would
have been defeated. But there was no
body capable of coping with the astute
Democrats who were conducting the
fusion fight from the ante-chamber,
and the vote was forced through.
The San Bernardino and other south
ern delegations were wavering and
could have been brought over to the
middle of the road had there been a
chance to labor with them even briefly.
Cornell's speech placing Maguire in
nomination was of the usual high
school declamation order, delivered
with great physical exertion and a
frightful waste of lung power.
Ditf.mar, who performed like service
for Shanahan, was an improvement in
oratorical effect and had the added
merit of being briefer. None of tho
seconding speeches, with the excep
tion of that of Cator, who spoke for
Shanahan, was above the ordinary.
Then came the vote with the result
as given heretofore. The middle-of-the
roadsters were really surprised at their
display of strength and saw, when too
late, that they had thrown away a
golden opportunity.

The advocates of fusion, which term
is synonomous with the name Maguire,
were feeling in better spirits. They
announced that they had won their
battle and that the middle-of-the-road
men would have to accept Maguire,
I notwithstanding his shortcomings on
; material and essential Popullstic ideas.

Judge J. N. Phillips, who has sue

of the Silver Republicans, came mighty
close to being turned down by the antl
fusionists when he asked permission to
address the convention. George D.
Glllesple, one of the head spielers of the
Buckley-Magulre Populist party, inter
ceded in Philli; i' behalf.
"He is one of our brothers," said
Gillespie, "and we should show him the

The privilege of the floor was then

plea in favor of fusion. He candidly
ANTI-FUSIONISTS
REFUSE TO ABIDE
BY THE DECISION
Meet io Convention and Formally.
Nominate Shjanahan for
Governor.
HON. T. W. H. SHANAHAN.
SACRAMENTO, July 14.â The predic
tion that the Populist party would be
wrecked if it listened to the proposition
of fusion and Msgulre has come true.
The middle-of-the-roadsters have
bolted the convention and will put a
ticket in the field with T. W. H. Shan
ahan of Shasta at the head.
When the convention adjourned last
evening, after nominating Maguire for
Governor, the anti-fusionists deter
mined upon holding a caucus to settle
upon some plan for future action.
They assembled in the Senate cham
bers at 9 o'clock and went into execu
tive session. It did not take them long
to decide that they had been betrayed
into the hands of the Democrats. The
more they thought over the matter the
angrier they became, and it was then
that the resolve was made to inaugu
rate a fight for Populist rights that
will end oniy when the sun goes down
next election day.
The suggestion was made that the
caucus be turned into a nominating
convent: n cf the Peo le's Party. Fow
ler of Alameda was elected temporary
chairman and Johnson of San Fran
cisco temporary secretary.
Chairman Fowler appointed T. E.
Clarke of Tulare, chairman of the com
mittee on permanent organization and
order of business; Green Majors of Ala
meda, chairman of the committee on
platform and resolutions, and W. R.
admitted that there had been traitors i
in the Silver Republican camp.
"But we found them out," he added,
"and dropped their heads in the bas
ket"
"What's the matter with Baker?
shouted one <>f the delegates. Phillips
was evidently so wrapped up in his ora- I
torical flight that he did not hear the
questionâ or at least he did not an
swer it.
"If you are going to do clean poli
tics, ' continued Phillips, "don't at
tempt to do it with the scavengers in
your ranks. . Get rid of them. We are
here at the common altar of freedom to
make a fight. The bosses are all
alarmed, for they know that we are
here for war to the knife and knife to
the hilt. We Silver Republicans greet
you as brother soldiers in our battle,
and we want to see you put a reputable
ticket in the field."
The fusionists applauded the speech
and Monteith of Marin suggested that
Phillips be given a vote of thanks for
his address, and also for securing the
political decapitation of G. Wandering
Baker. The thanks were presented, but
the anti-fusionists did not take any
part in the bouquet throwing.
A partial report from the majority of
the committee on rules of order and
permanent organization, the main fea
tures of which were published in The
Call to-day, was read by Gillespie of
San Francisco. â Â»
J. E. Camp of Alameda presented a
minority report. He objected to the
appointment of a commltttee to con
fer with "representatives of the other
reform parties," suggested in the ma
jority report, as he deemed it unneces
sary. He believed that, the convention
first should adopt a plnform and then
nominate a straight out-and-out Popu
list to stand on it.
The remarks of Camp were provoca
tivo of an outburst of oratory. John
Raspberry Jones, who hails from Ala
meda and wants to go to Congress from
the Third District, moved to lay the
minority report ~n the table. On mo
tion of Cornell of Alameda that portion
of the report making the temporary
officers the permanent officers of the
convention was adopted.
Then followed a long and wearisome
Batton of Alameda, chairman of the
committee on credentials.
It was next decided to place a full
ticket in the field to represent the Peo
ple's party. One of the members con
temptuously remarked that the con
vention that had nominated Congress
man Maguire was "only a Democratic
side show." The delegates were ex
cited and angry and they did not want
to waste any time In settling with their
matters.
T. W. H. Shanahan, who was beaten
for nomination for Governor by Ma
guire, was unanimously chosen as the
candidate of those present for Gover
nor. Shanahan appeared before the
convention, accepted the nomination
! and declared i-iat no power on earth
! could pull him down. Shanahan looked
I happy and the delegates cheered.
An adjournment was then taken until
9:30 o'clock th morning, when the re
mainder of the ticket will be named.
Every part f the State was repre
sented in the convention, as is shown
by the following committees:
Credentialsâ W. R. Batton, Alameda; J.
M. Murphy, Shasta; W. O. Griggs, Sono
ma; W. R. Crawford, Kern; Alex White,
Colusa.
Permanent Organization and Order of
Busingsâ T. E. Clark, Tulare; A. Bretz,
Alameda; T. H. Porter, San Francisco;
Samuel oiewart, Solano; George Hale, El
Dorado.
Platform â Green Majors, Alameda;
Frank Houghton, Tehama; James Mor
gan, Santa Barbara; J. Q. Stocking, San
Diego; H. C. Wilson. Lake; T. G. Sharp,
Tehama; M. L. Landon. Monterey; C. F.
McGlashan. Nevada; J. E. Camp, Sacra
mento; F. P. Stewart, San Bernardino.
debate. Fowler of Alameda was op
posed to the majority report, suggest
ing that a conference committee be ap
pointed, and that for the time being
the nominations stop at that for Gov
ernor. He insisted upon having tb,e re
port referred back to the original com
mittee, with instructions to report an
order of business that could include all
the places to be filled on the ticket.
Cator of San Francisco backed Fow
ler and Camp in the stand they had
taken. He said that he wanted to see
a straight Populist ticket nominated
without fusion.
Cornell of Alameda moved to lay the
minority report on the table, and there
was another wrangle. When a stand-
Ing vote was taken a half hour later
the secretary announced that 74 dele
gates favored the motion and 75 were
opposed to it. The announcement was
greeted with cheers by ' the antl-Ma
guire forces.
Carlson of Los Angeles, a strong Ma
guire worker, demanded a call of the
roll on the question.
"Many delegates voted under a mis
apprehension of the question," said he
'and I know that we all want a fair
vote."
Chairman Hutchinson, a fusionist and
Maguire Populist, cut oft further de
bate by /.-t-dering a call of the roll, "to
refute any possible Imputation of un
fairness that might afterward be
raised."
The vote was taken by counties, those
present voting the absentees, with the
result that the motion which had been
previously lost was carried by a vote
of 138 noes to 153 ayes.
The majority report was then adopted
as presented and the convention re
solved into seven Congressional Dis
trict conventions to select the members
of the conference. Those chosen were-
First District, George W. Montelth',
Marin; Second, Dr. A. L. Forman, San
Joaquin; Third, John Aubrey Jones
Alameda; Fourth. George D. Gillespie
San Francisco; Fifth, J. W. Mines'
Santa Clara; Sixth, TV. P. Netherton
Santa Cruz; Seventh. John 8. Dore',
Fresno.
A recess was then taken until S
o'clock and a row was narrowly
averted.
"There will be a oauous," shouted
VCator of San Francisco, "at the State
house immediately of all those who are
opposed to Dominating a Democrat in a
Populist convention."
"You mean a caucus of those Inter
ested In the railroad," answered Mun
teith of Maxin.
Tin n other delegates commenced
throwing out taunting remarks and for
several minutes the air was laden with
the unpleasant things spoken.
It was 3::>0 o'clock when Chairman
Hutchinson called the delegates to or
der again. It was announced that the
rence < ommlttee was still "con
ferring" and no report was received up
to the hour of adjournment. The re
port was ready but the Maguire men
had it held back until they rushed
their programme through.
The committee on platform was ready
to report and the secretary frequently
was Interrupted by handclapplng while
reading the declaration of principles.
The platform was adopted without a
dissenting vote.
Cat or of San Francisco then threw a
firebrand in the shape of a resolution
into the convention. It provided that
no person was eligible for nomination
by the convention unless he first in
dorsed the platform. This was intended
to hit at Maguire. who is at present
enjoying the hospitality of th*> Croker
Club at New Fork. "If any aspirant is
absent." remarked Cator, rather dryly,
"the platf >rm could be telegraphed
him."
A how i went up from the Maguire-
Ites. They said that the resolution was
unfair and was Intended to delay the
work of the convention. The anti
fusion people and opponents of Ma
!â  ; lied that it would not be
right to v >mlnate a man before know-
Ing thai h< would accept the platform
party.
â  us I" 1 sure we are nominating
yelled one of the middle-of
the-road men.
at length in support of
the resolution. He asked if it would be
6af< to nominate a man like Maguire,
wh had Bhown himself to be opposed
to an Income tax. when that was one of
the planks in the platform, unless he
had first been pledged to stand by the
platform.
Gillesple of San Francisco replied
that any statement that Maguire did
I ' favor an income tax was absolute
ly and unequivocally false, and that its
.ess could readily be shown if
]â¢â¢ â !" rence was made to tlv Congres
rds.
Bon of Santa Clara tried to pour
oil nn the troubled waters by offering a
substitute for the resolution, which
provided that the chairman and secre
tary <if the convention be empowered
t" withheld the certificate of nomina
tion â  nominee until after he
had subsi ribed to the platform. The
titute prevailed, but that did not
satisfy the anXl-Maguire men. They
want.-d something more binding, and
â â  wrangle followed.
The breach was finally healed by the
adoption of a resolution providing that
indidates must sign the platform
inside n days after being nomi
nated, unless they are absent from the
State. In the latter event the platform
must he signed inside of fifteen days
after the return of the absentee.
Nominations for Governor were then
declared in order. Cornell of Alameda
caught the eye of Chairman Hutchin-
Bon first and was granted the floor. In
a highly laudatory speech he presented
the name of Congressman Maguire,
who, he said, would be Indorsed by the
Democratic party. Maguire was pic
tured by him as the only savior of the
State and the only man who would
make a stern fight against the railroad
octopus.
Dittmar of Shasta followed In a stir
ring speech in favor of the tali syca
more of Shasta, T. W. H. Shanahan.
"If we nominate Shanahan," said he,
"we can go back to our constituents
and say to them, .'We have nominated
a People's Party ticket.' While 1 have
nothing to say ar-alnst the honesty and
Integrity of Congressman Maguire, I
have this to say: That his nomination
will virtually mean a surrender to th?
Democratic party."
Sprague of Los Angeles, Burnett of
Fan Luis Oblspo. Mouser of San Diego
and Xetherton of Santa Cruz espoused
the cause of Maguire "as an honest
man and the best friend reform ever
had."
Murphy of Shasta spoke in behalf of
Shannhan and predicted that a mistake
would be made if Maguire was chosen
standard bearer.
"I know full well," he said, "that the
people in my county will not stand for
fusion ar.d Maguire."
C.ntor of San Francisco mad" the
d< sing speech In favor of Shanahan.
He said he had no personal feeling
against Maguire. They differed on po
litical questions.
"Let us stand by the principles of
our party." said he in conclusion, "and
nominate a Populist who commands
the .admiration and respect of the peo
ple of tho State, ami around whom the
Populists will rally."
There were calls from all parts of
the convention for Shanahan, who
was out in the hallway while the nice
things were being said about him. His
appearance before the convention was
the signal for cheering among the anti
fusion people. He told of his record In
the legislature and of his desertion of
the Democratic party when he found it
false.
"I have fought hard and earnestly
for the Populist party," said he, "and
I did not expect that I would ever be
called upon before a Populist convention
to fight politically a candidate who
does'nt belong to the party. 1 am afraid
gentlemen, that if you nominate Ma
gulre y-'ii will be making a grave mis
take. Ills nomination means nothing
nor nothing less than political
BuJclde."
As Shanahan was about to with
draw Monteith of Marin asked him If
uld support Maguire if Maguire
ed the nomination. Shanahan
ited for a moment. Then he
slowly replied:
"That is a hard question to answer.
If he declares himself a Populist and
subscribes to our party platform I will
support him."
"If yui ar- nominated," continued
Monteith. "will you remain at the. head
of the ticket and not withdraw if given
th<> Democratic nomination for Lieu
tenant -Governor?
"If the Populist party nominates me
ami puts up a Populist ticket I will
fight for it t > the end."
Tho roll was then ordered called and
Maguire was nominated on the first
ballot by 154% votes to Shanahan's
i 30,,. The vote by counties was as fol

FUSION BASIS
DECIDED UPON
Mow the Spoils Will Be Di
vided Between the
Three Partiss.
SACRAMENTO, July 14.â The Ma
guire Pupuilsts say that the-y don't care
the least little bit about the bolt. They
assert that they have the organization
and that they will be able to hold the
party title. They will, in all probabil
ity, read the middle-of-the-road men
out of the party to-day and go ahead
under the unwise tutorship of the
Democracy.
The Democrats have given the Popu
lists eight places on the State ticket
on condition that they give two of the
nominations to the Silver Republicans.
The Populists have agreed to this
scheme, and at 1 o'clock this morning
were fixing up their slate.
Congressman Barlow of the Sixth
district has been renominated and
Congressman Castle of the Seventh will
be renominated. The other congres
sional places go to the Democrats.
McCraney of Los Angeles, a silver Re
publican, will be given the nomination
for clerk of the Supreme Court, and
Judge Van Dyke, another silver Re
publican, will be named for Justice of
the Supreme Court. Chairman Hutch
inson of the convention is slated for
Lieutenant Governor, and in addition
the Populists will have one member of
the Board of Equalization, one Rail
road Commissioner and the State Con
troller.
The slate candidates for these places
have not been chosen up to the present
hour.
An entire State ticket will be nomi
nated but those receiving nominations
for offices not enumerat.nl understand
that they are only dummies. They will
have to hand in their resignations to
the chairman and secretary of the con
vention so that they can be pulled off
the ticket when occasion requires.
CANDIDATES
FOR CONGRESS
Barlow Is Renominated and
De Vries and Castle
Will Be.
SACRAMENTO, July IS.â Six of the
Congressional delegations will get to
work in the morning and make their
nominations for Congressmen. The
Seventh district met to-day and nomi
nated Barlow. De Tries will be re
nominated in the Second and Castle in
the Sixth. .1. A. Jones of Alameda is a
candidate for the Third district nomi
nation and probably will get it unless
bowled out by the fusion agreement.
Judge W. P. Lawler has been here
since Monday working for the Populist
indorsement in the Fourth district, and
is confident to-night that he will get
it. He regards his nomination by the
Democrats as a foregone conclusion.

MORE HONOR FOR THE
BATTLESHIP OREGON
Selected as the Flagship of Com-
modore Watson's East
ern Squadron.
NEW YORK, July 13.â The Washington
correspondent of the Herald sends the fol
lowing: Believing that the effect of the
appearance of an American squadron on
the Spanish coast will be In direct propor
tion to the strength of the fleet. Secretary
Long and the Naval War Board have de
cided to strengthen Commo.dore Watson's
command by additional armored and,
probably, three or four protected and un
protected cruisers.
In the squadron as finally formed the
mo"st important change has been the
transfer of the commander In chief's flag
from the protected cruiser Newark to tiie
battle-ship Oregon. following this action
the department, In accordance with the
request of Commodore Watson, has des
ignated Captain C. E. Clark, commanding
the battle-ship, as. chief of stair of the
Eastern squadron.
The Newark, I am told, will not be de
tached from the squadron, but will be
employed for scouting and for overhaul
ing Spanish vessels which may appear
and her work will consequently take her
to some extent from the lino of battle
ships. Commodore Watson, therefore, de
termined to transfer his flap and selected
the Oregon.
It is gossip of the department that
either '..'â 'â  lowa or the Indiana w'l
be assigned to the Eastern squadron, with
the probability in favor of the lowa,
Captain Evans' ship was assigned to the
fleet by tho department, but upon rec
ommendation of R*ar Admiral Sampson
was detached because of tne foulness of
her bottom. The Indiana is practically
in the same condition as the lowa but
tho latter's speed is greater. For' this
reason she will probably be selected.
ii id believed the New Orleans, Minne
apolis and Columbia will be attached to
the Eastern squadron and the converted
cruiser Prairie may also be assigned to
it. If this hould be done Commodore Wat
son will have under his command three
battle-shipsâ the Oregon, Massachusetts
and lowaâ four protected cruisers and
four converted cruisers, which will be
easily able to dispose of all ships which
remain of Spain's navy. The formation
of such a largo squadron means that a
more extensive programme Of operations
Is being outlined for Commodore Watson
to follow than was originally contem
plated.

ALICE RIX GOES TO HONOLULU FOR THE CALL
On the Alameda, which, by the time this meets the eye of the reader, will be well beyond the
heads on the way to Honolulu, is Mrs. Alice Rix. She goes as the representative of The Call, and will
prepare for it an account of the formal ceremony marking the raising of the stars and stripes over the
islands. That there is no writer better equipped for this duty than Mrs. Xix is a fact concerning
which no dispute can arise. That she is the ablest woman contributor to any American paper will be
admitted. With a breadth of view masculine in its scope, she has a wonderful facility of expression, a
quick and most felicitous insight, a ready grasp of whatever situation may be presented, and, more
than all, the tender sympathy of the gentle woman. is in h*:r work a charm, a vivacity, and
yet a depth. Choosing words with the utmost nicety, she never wastes one of them. She does not
strive lor effect but she attains the effect by a process so natural that the completed work is as per
fect as a poem. There is nowhere an inartistic touch. There is always the portrayal of truth so
gemmed that it shines out with such a radiance as few writers have been able, even feebly, to imi
tate. The Call is glad to have for its representative at the stirring scenes of the near future so able
and delightful a writer.

said the amount asked for will be $40,
000. It Is necessary to raise money to
pay off the indebtedness of the city
caused by the extravagance of the last
City Councilâ Fay, Nolting, Dittus and
Krieg. Before the city election the
people were promised that if the so
called People's party elected its ticket
the city would have a "business ad
ministration." With this glittering
promise held out, many voted the
"gang" ticket, but now they find
that they were bunkoed. Things are
going right along in the same old rut.
With the exception of Mayor Martin,
none of the city officials have tried to
curtail expenses. The Council has aid
ed in incurring expense. Never be
fore were the city funds so low, but
the ofliicals are as lavish in their ex
penditures as in previous years.
The present condition of the various
funds will show the financial condition
of the city. There will be no money
available from taxes until December.
The funds contain: Police fund, $92;
park Improvement fund, $1 10; street
fund, $200; sewer fund, $92; fire depart
ment fund, $25. The expenses of the
Police Department amount to about
$2500 a month, and of the Fire Depart
ment about $3300 a month, and here
there can and should be no curtail
ment. The city pays out $1510 a month
for street lighting and nearly $700 n.
month for street sweeping. The mem
bers of the police and fire departments
will have to shave their warants with
brokers from this time on or wait until
December for their money.
In the school department for the
year ending June 30 there was a deficit
of $6503 89. The expenses contracted
for the coming fiscal year will amount
to $124,000. This Includes teachers'
salaries and other expenses. Receipts
will amount to $82,000, leaving $42,000 to
be raised by city taxes. There will be
a $15,000 apportionment from the State
From a Photograph by Taber.
that can be used to reduce this de
ficiency, but even then $27,000 must be
raised, and this is more than can be
legally done under the charter. Never
before were the school affairs In such
bad condition.
Th<Â» new High School, for which $75,
000 bonds were issued, is still uncom
pleted. About $12,000 will be needed to
finish and furnish it, and there are but
a few hundred dollars in the fund. It
Is proposed to obtain the necessary coin
by issuing bonds.
In spite of tl.is scarcity of funds the
City Board of Education has created
the position <if Supervisor of Kinder
gartens for Miss BfÂ»lle MacKenzie at
$75 a month. The Trustees have been
so ashamed of their extravagance that
they have not yet had this last action
placed on the minutes of the board.
There is no more need for a Supervisor
of Kindergartens than there is for a
corps of nurses in connection with
these schools.
Another place in which expenses
should be curtailed is City Clerk Cook's
office. Two clerks could be dispensed
with easily and the city would be saved
$2400 a year. ..hen the collection of
city taxes was transferred to the Coun
ty Tax Collector's office the people were
promised a saving of a couple of clerks
in the City Cl' rk's office. Up to that
time the work on the assessment roll ne
cessitated the employment of a couple
of clerks, as there was considerable
extra work, but since then no decrease
has been made in the force. Instead
John Varcoe has been given a soft Job.
He Is supposed to be revising the or
dinances but in reality is nothing but
a clerk of Cook's. For this he receives
$100 a month. Varcoe wax given the
position because of the work he did
for the "gang" during the campaign.
Another clerk could be dispensed with
in the office. This would save the peo
ple $2400 a year and be giving the city
a business administration.
The people are realizing that under
the new charter of the city they are
still under "gang" rule. The issue of
bonds about to be called for Is a fair
sample of the way Rea and his "gang"
propose to run the city. There is strong
opposition to another bond issue and it
may be defeated.
MINING SUIT DECIDED.
PRESCOTT. July 13.â A mining puit has
just been decided here which, if sustained
by the higher courts, promises to revolu
tionize methods of making mining deals,
as well as to involve numerous proper
ties in litigation. Six years ago Dr. H.
H. Warner contracted with Judge K. W.
Wells and John I^awler for the purchase
of the Hillside mine for $,"00,000, paying
over $200,000. Warner stocked the mine
under the name of the Seven Stars Min
ing Company for $3,000,000, selling large
quantities of stock in Eastern States and
Europe, giving a personal guarantee that
the. mine would pay 1"> per cent a year
dividend. Warner failed and the Seven
Stars Mining Company collapsed with
him. Wells and Lawler always offered a
complete sale and to give a deed on re
ceipt of the balance agreed upon, al
though the conditions of Warner's con
tract provided for the forfeiture of all
money paid and all improvements placed
on the property if final payment was not
made in a stipulated time, long since
past.
The stockholders brought suit against
Wells and Lawlor for the recovery of
money paid for stock of the Seven Stars
Company and judgment has just been
rendered in favor of the plaintiffs for a
hundred and eighty thousand dollars, to
act as a lien against the mine until paid.
The case will be appealed to the Supreme
Court of the Territory and then to the
Supreme Court of the United States.
MAY END THE
WATER FIGHT
Relief in Sight for Los
Angeles.
KESSLER PROJECT FAVORED
BELIEVED TO BE PREFERABLE
TO LITIGATION.
The Proposition Is Indorsed in
Resolutions by the Demo
cratic City Central
Committee.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, July 13.-The Los
Angeles water problem assumed a new
phase to-day. The Democratic City
Central Committee met and adopted a
set of resolutions indorsing the propo
sition of Kessler & Co., who are apply
ing for a fifty-year franchise under
conditions which virtually amount to
municipal ownership.
The resolutions recite that the legal
committee of the Central Committee
has reported that any attempt by the
city to take possession of the present
water system would Involve the city in
interminable litigation, without accom
plishing the desired result and would
cause the present unbearable condition
to remain during the years that such
litigation would be in progress; that
any attempted arbitration is sure to
result in the same way If It does not
end as desired by the water company
in an award of $2,000,000 more than the
present plant is worth; that there is
now offered to the city by Kessler &
Co. a proposition, which, while it is not
all that the Los Angeles city Dem
ocracy has sought, is still a good
proposition, is very near to municipal
ownership, and promises relief from
the present unbearable conditions, as
well as a large financial consideration
to the city. In closing the resolutions
indorse Kessler & Co.'s application for
a franchise.
It is now believed that thore Is a
probability of settling the water mat
tor within ten days.
Kessler ft Co. propose for a fifty
years' franchise to give the city ail
water for municipal purposes free,
clear the city title to all water rights
now in contest and to give it 2 1 /*. per
cent of the gross income of the" first
five years and 5 per cent thereafter
until the expiration of the franchise.

WORKMEN FATALLY BURNED
SLIGHT DAMAGE DONE TO THE
BUILDING.
Belief That the Unfortunate Man
Struck a Steel Nail With His
Mixer, Creating a
Spark.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA CRUZ, July 13.â An explo
sion occurred in the prismatic powder
mill at the powder works at 2:30 o'clock
this afternoon, fatally burning Carlyle
Ross, aged 19. Ross was mixing black
powder preparatory to placing it in the
press, when about twenty pounds ex
ploded, burning his face and body so
that he was hardly recognizable. He
ran toward the creek, and other em
ployes seized him and tore off his burn
ing clothes. Ross was bending over the
powder at the time of the explosion, so
his face is horribly burned. He also
inhaled the fire.
Morris Griffith, who was ten feet
away, was thrown several feet, but not
injured. Sam Miller, who was six feet
away, had his hair singed.
The damage to the building is
slight. "Work will be resumed in the
mill on Friday. Fortunately the other
employes of the mill happened to be
away.
It has been found that there were
steel nails in the box in which the ex
plosion occurred, and they probably
were struck by the copper scoop which
Ross used in mixing the powder, pro
ducing a spark. The flre spread to the
hopper of the small prismatic press and
then to two barrels of powder on the
back porch, which exploded. In all
about 2-jO pounds was exploded.

VOLUNTEERS IN REVOLT.
CARSON, July 13.â Dissension Is rife in
the ranks of the Nevada Battalion and
two companies threaten to depart in the
morning. The trouble arose over certain
officers who were selected by the Gov
ernor to receive commissions in a com
pany formed to-day by the consolidation
of the Emmet Guards and Company E
of Elko. Governor Sadler named W. C.
Morrison of the Emmets as captain, J.
E. Sanders of Company E first lieuten
ant, and Georg"e Pyne of the Emmets
second lieutenant. The Emmets immedi
ately rebelled because Sullivan of their
company did not receive a second lieuton
antship and the Elko boys objected be
cause Sanders of their company was not
appointed captain. They finally effected an
agreement by which they would ask
the Governor to select either Sanders
or Morrison as major of the bat
talion and give Sullivan a commission In
the company. It has been rumored forsev

YELLOW JACK
IN TIE CAMP
Burning of Siboney as a
Safeguard.
REPORTS CAUSE ANXIETY
SANTIAGO REFUGEES SPREAD
THE DISEASE.
A Few Cases in the Quartermaster's
Department â Every Precau
tion Taken by Our Med
ical Corps.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, July 13.â The press
reports of the burning of Siboney by
the medical officers of the United
States army had a depressing effect
here upon the friends of the soldiers at
the front in Cuba. For a long time it
was impossible to learn anything from
any official source as to the exact state
of affairs at tl.e headquarters of the
army corps and this reticence on the
part of the officials had the natural ef
fect to increase me apprehension.
Finally the fact was reluctantly ad
mitted that it was not certain that yel
low fever existed at Siboney, but the
reports received over night from the
medical officers did state that there
were fourteen suspicious cases of fever.
The fact that these cases were almost
entirely confined to members of the
quartermaster's department, teamsters
and others, encouraged the officials here
to believe that the main body of the
army is not in danger from the disease
if it should turn out to be yellow fever.
That the disease did exist in Santi
ago, though never officially admitted,
was known through private letters
from officers at the front, and the exo
dus from the city to the vicinity of
Shafter's camp of 18,000 inhabitants,
presumably for the most part in a des
titute and filthy condition, would afford
ample opportunity for the communica
tion of the disease to the American
troops.
It is not doubted that General Shaf
ter has done all that is possible to pre
vent close communication between
the army and the refugees
for sanitary reasons; but in
his efforts to assist the poor people to
the extent of his power he has been
obliged to make # use of the quarter
master's department to deliver sup
plies to them, and from the exposure
thus resulting the fourteen cases re
ported found their origin, as the lat
est dispatches say that nine of the
cases were among the quartermaster's
department employes and five among
refugees. They are regarded as mild
cases of yellow fever.
The promptness with which the sick
men have been isolated and the thor
ough precautions adopted to secure for
them the best nursing and medicine,
combined with the improved methods
of treatment of fever that have been
developed by the United States Marine
Hospital service and adopted by the
army, would seem to warrant the con
fidence expressed by medical officers
here of the ability of the surgeons with
General Shafter to control these sus
picious cases and prevent an extension
of the fever.
The presence In the camp of Dr. John
Guiteras of the University of Penn
sylvania, one of the most famous yol
low fever experts in the world, Is an
additional source of confidence in tha
proper management of the situation.
According to the best information ob
tainable by the Navy Department
there has been no sign of contagious
disease among any of the vessels of
Sampson's fleet, nor among the marines
at Guantanamo, the first of the Amer
ican forces to land in Cuba.

HONORS FOR THE HEROES.
BY ali means the best suggestion yet made con
cerning the proper method of rewarding our
naval heroes is that of the New York Herald,
which proposes a revival of the rank of admiral and
vice admiral in the navy; the former to be bestowed
upon Dewey lor his decisive victory at Manila, which
virtually gave us the Philippines, and the other upon
Schley, who chased the fleet of Cervera into Santi
ago harbor, bottled it up there and finally destroyed
it when in the rashness of despair it ventured out.
In no other way does it seem that adequate recog
nition, honor and reward can be bestowed upon these
great sea captains without doing some wrong to
others. To place them at the head of the list under
the existing organization of the navy means, of
course, that those who have hitherto ranked them
must be reduced several numbers below their present
standing. There is no reason why that should be
done, and to reduce them without reason vfrould be
an injustice. To revive the higher grades that were
conferred upon the great naval commanders of the
Civil War would wrong no one, and would be, be
sides the most fitting reward for those who in this
conflict have so ably upheld victorious traditions of
Farragut and Porter.
While the proposed revival of the rank of admiral
and vice admiral is likely to receive general support
throughout the country, there will be an equally fa
vorable consideration given to the suggestion of the
Herald regarding the persons to receive the offices.
With respect to the appointment of Dewey to the
higher rank there will be no dispute. The prefer
ment of Schley over Sampson may occasion some
controversy, but the argument of facts is on the side
of the man named by the Herald. It was Schley
who tirelessly chased Cervera all over the Caribbean
Sea: it was Schley who drove him into Santiago, and
it was Schley who commanded the fleet during the
battle that destroyed him. To Schley. therefore, be
longs of right the honor and the reward.
OUR TRADE IN MEXICO.
GEORGE R. ALLEN, one of the vice-presidents
of the National Association of Manufacturers,
who has recently returned from a business tour
through Mexico, is quoted by the Chicago Times-
Herald as reporting that he had visited every city of
importance in the republic from El Paso to Yucatan,
and had everywhere found the feeling very strong in
favor of American merchandise. Nevertheless he
found it difficult to obtain many articles of American
production in any of the cities. In explanation of
this contradiction he said:
"Complaints were registered everywhere about our
manner of doing business, as Americans are entirely
misinformed regarding trade matters there. It is the
common practice of American merchants and manu
facturers to do business with houses that are entirely
antagonistic to their interests by giving them exclusive
agencies because they are the wealthiest and of the
highest standing in the trade. It must be understood
that the bulk of the trade is in the control of German
and Spanish firms. The latter are very much opposed
to the establishment of American houses of any busi
ness in Mexico."
Mr. Allen is further reported as saying he visited
many of the leading houses in different cities under
the pretext of buying such articles as pianos, agricul
tural implement?, etc., and was surprised to find that
while in many cases these houses were the exclusive
agents in Mexico of prominent American manufac
turers, they would not guarantee American goods as
against German or other European goods of the same
sort. .
If any Californian manufacturer or merchant has
given the Mexican agency for his goods to some
learner Spanish or German house in that country this
report will be of interest to him. The only sure way
to build up a trade there is to send Californian drum
mer;: through the principal cities and towns to place
the goods with smaller dealers. Trying to do Ameri
can business through big foreign houses in Mexico, or
possibly in any part of Spanish America, is not likely
to be profitable.
A woman has been sentenced to the electric chair
in New York. Naturally the experience of being
sentenced was not agreeable, but any one inclined to
wager can with lafety back with money the proposi
tion that the woman will not undergo the final ordeal.
There has not yet been time for circulation of peti
tions for clemency, but doubtless they have been
drawn up and will soon be going the rounds.
Americans are said to be finding dummy wooden
guns among the fortifications of Santiago. Spain
would have saved money and accomplisiie as much
at sea if this variety had been used on the ships of
her navy.
If Spain really wants a first-class Premier the ad
vertising columns of this paper are open to the Queen
Regent at reduced rates. , It shall not be said that
we are lacking in charity.
SAN FRANCISCO OND HONOLULU.
IT has pleased Mr. Thurston, lobbyist for annexa
tion, to express the great expectations entertained
by him regarding the effects of union upon
the wealth of the islands. He wants Hawaii to be a
Territory, and ultimately a State. Meantime he pro
poses to have Honolulu erected into one of the great
est naval stations in the world.
Of course this means its fortification and the ex
penditure of a great many million*, and of more
millions on warships to defend those tropical posses
sions. All this expenditure is to be demanded on
the continuing theory that Honolulu Is on the short
est route for commerce through the Nicaragua canal.
As that theory helped annexation along, it is natural
that its proponents should try to use it as a siphon
for millions to be spent for the benefit of Honolulu.
As things have gone and are going, it is probable
that the Western Senators will have leisure to repent
of their votes for annexation.
California has been always rather a step-sister
among the States. Her contribution in taxes to
the public treasury and in commerce to the common
wealth has been large, out of proportion to her popu
lation and still more out of proportion to the bene
fits she has received from her Federal relation.
The shortest route from the western end of the
Nicaragua canal passes within 100 miles of San
Francisco, and is distant 1600 miles from Honolulu.
If the shortest route is to be patrolled by a great
navy, its station should be here and not at Honolulu.
As so many of our commercial bodies have thought
lessly committed themselves to the Hawaiian route;
they cannot now consistently ask the expenditure here
of the many millions which make Mr. Thurston's
mouth water. If the existence of a great naval
station at Honolulu mean the diversion of commerce
to that route, for the sake of the protection it will
have from warships, it means also the sidetracking
of San Francisco as the port of the canal.
Mr. Thurston desires a territorial government for
the islands. If that be accorded we will have the
novel spectacle of a Territory, in novitiate for state
hood, with a voting population of about 1600. with
the cost of its government paid out of the Federal
treasury. Mr. Thurston is justified in saying that
the islands are now an excellent plavc for men with
money. Why not? We have agreed to pay their
debt of four or five millions; as a Territory we will
pay all the cost of their government, and will spend
tens or hundreds of millions in fortifying a naval
station, and will post there many ships to be sup
plied. Truly now is the time for men with money
to get in.
WISE fIND HONORABLE DIPLOMACY.
'"IT-HE conduct of Admiral Dewey since the battle
j of Manila is winning lor him lame in the held
â¢ oi diplomacy second only to that he modestly
bears as a seaman and a soldier. Nothing could
have been more statesmanlike than his treatment of
the German ship which had interfered with the in
surgents and protected the Spanish. He took, the
matter out oi insurgent jurisdiction and sent two of
his own boats to assault the point away from which
the men of Aguinaldo had been intimidated by the
representative of a power which should be strictly
neutral, but which is not. The German skurned oft'
as one who had been detected in mischief.
Worse than no excuse is the statement that the
German intervened on behalf of humanity. So far
as may be gleaned from the fairly complete account
of events as they have thus far been hurried into
the making of history, Admiral Dewey is competent
to throw about the interests of humanity in that quar-
ter as strong a shield as the circumstances require.
Even if he needed help he would not ask the German
admiral for it, and such help could not be tendered
without being construed into an intentional affront.
That there is an ulterior motive in the meddling ten
dency is already apparent. The gathering- of a
strong squadron 01 the Kaiser's war vessels is in it
self a breach of courtesy, and an exhibition of bad
manners.
Admiral Dewey displays excellent Judgment in not
being openly resentful, and yet in maintaining the
dignity of his sway. A rash commander might have
made a hostile demonstration, but Dewcy merely ig
nored the presence of the interloper and the thunder
of his guns, directed not at it, but in spite of it, lent
all the necessary emphasis to the rebuke. Germany
need not expect to plead love for humanity and think
to make the plea impressive. The status of her in
terests in the islands will not sustain the contention,
although there is no need here to enlarge upon this
point.
Nobody believes we are to have with Germany
any trouble rising above the grade of a petty annoy
ance, and one ground for this theory is that such a
man as Admiral Dewey is where he can hold in
check a spirit of aggression which might easily, under
some circumstances, be regarded as a grave danger.
Germany will doubtless go to the greatest length
she can without provoking hostilities. Her states
men must recognize that an overt act leading to war
would involve more than herself and the United
States, and that in the end her fleets would be swept
from the seas as completely as the ill-fated navy of
Spain.
CfILIFORNIAN MINES.
WHILE the energies and capital of so many
mining men have been distracted from Cali
fornia by the Alaska excitement and the Klon
dike craze it is gratifying to learn capitalists of the
Eastern States and of Europe have not lost sight of
the richness of Californian mines nor of the profits
to be gained from judicious investments in them.
From interviews with a number of capitalists from
the mining counties it is learned that in Sierra and
Placer there has been this year a considerable de
velopment of mining property by outside companies.
Among the examples given of this work it was stated
that the famous Thistle mine, about two miles from
Gibsonville, is being worked by a Scotch syndicate,
which is developing a great gravel deposit and now
has a shaft down 500 feet working in good ground.
The Gold Bluff mine has been bonded by two New
York capitalists, who are pumping out the old shaft
and will sink on the same ledge. At the Mountain
quartz mine, which has been idle for some time, East
ern capitalists will begin with a large force and oper-
I ate a forty-stamp mill.
These instances of the activity of Eastern and for
eign mining companies in a comparatively small por
tion of the vast mining district of the State are suffi
cient to show that the attention of mining investors
is not directed wholly to the frozen region of the
Yukon. Moreover, it is safe to say that in the long
ran the Caiifornian investments will pay much better
than the average on the Klondike or any other dis
trict of the Yukon Valley.
Mining in California has in fact ceased to be a
speculation and become a legitimate business with
sure and profitable returns when properly conducted.
Moreover, the full extent of our gold resources is not
yet known. There is a chance for the prospector as

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JULY 14, 1898.
FRESH pROM THE PEOPLE.
WHEN the Republican State Central Commit
tee meets to arrange for the State convention
of the party it should so provide for the elec
tion of delegates to that convention that every loyal
Republican will be rightly and properly represented.
It should call for a convention of delegates coming
straight from the people, chosen by the people to
represent the people. It should not be a conven
tion made up of men picked out by local bosses, and
dominated by State bosses. It should not be made
up of old warhorses, or sawhorses, or sawbucks.
It should be made up of independent men. Every
delegate should come to it with his credentials fresh
from the rank and file of the party. It should be a
Republican convention in the full meaning of the
term.
â It has been the practice in some sections of the
State for a county central committee to appoint the
men who represent the county at the State conven
tion. That method may have had some reason for
its practice in times past, but there i& none now. It
may have been a good practice in times past, but
the virtue has gone out of it. It is now a practice
which subordinates the party to petty bosses, de
prives the rank and file of loyal Republicans of any
voice in the conduct of party affairs, virtually elimi
nates the people from politics, destroys enthusiasm,
crowds out men of vigor and originality, and turns
the whole political organism into a species of mech
anism as devoid of intellect as of soul.
In some few remote districts of the State, where
the inhabitants are few and far between, where it is
difficult for voters to assemble, and where primaries
are rendered almost an impossiblity by the very na
ture of things, a delegation to the State convention
named by the county committee may be tolerated,
but from any well settled county such a delegation
should not be accepted. Wherever ft is possible
to hold primaries for the election of delegates to
county conventions they should be held. The State
Central Committee should make that obligatory and
binding on all the great counties of the common
wealth.
The demand of loyal Republicans is for primaries,
honestly conducted, on terms that give every mem
ber of the party an equal right to cast his vote and
have it counted. The conditions of the time add
to the force of that demand. Genuine Republican
ism can achieve a sweeping victory this fall, but
spurious, boss-ridden Republicanism cannot.
To get genuine Republicanism to the front we must
open the way for the rank and file to come forward
with their vigor, their earnestness and their loyalty.
It is the duty of the State Central Committee to see
to it that the way is opened in every county. Let
us have no boss-appointed county conventions or
boss-appointed delegates to the State convention.
Let us have primaries. Let us have delegates fresh
from the people.
OUR CONSULAR SERVICE.
AMONG the more important articles in the mag
azines and reviews for the current month a
prominent place is held by a dissertation on
"Our inadequate Consular Service," by Senator Ste
phen Ai. White. it is another oi the many argu
ments made of late in favor of radical reform in tue
method ot providing men to look after our commer
cial and other interests in different parts oi the world.
As such it merits and will receive the attentive con
sideration of all who are interested in the subject.
The Senator points out that the consular service
is one of growing importance to the nation, for the
reason that our foreign commerce is rapidly extend
ing. As he says the United States is no longer
content with the home market. We meet the world
in the world's markets. Though confident of our
ability to hold our own we can reap our just share
of the world's trade only by utilizing all legitimate
advantages, and our merchants are entitled to insist
that the Government shall do its share within proper
lines toward their protection.
The duties of a Consul are many, and in some
localities they require not only a high order of ability
but a special training for their adequate performance.
The great commercial nations of Europe have learned
the value of trained men in their consular service and
have long been careful in the selection of them. In
the United States, on the other hand, the consular
service continues to be a part of the spoils of poli
tics, and its offices are distributed with but little re
gard for commercial interests. As a consequence
we are being outstripped in commerce, even in mar
kets where with our advantages we ought to have the
lion's share.
Among the defects of the system which Mr. White
points out are the uncertainty of tenure, the frequent
changes in office, the inadequate pay in many cases
and the injustice of some of the laws governing the
service. He gives a curious illustration of the lat
ter. An American Consul at Tamatave was com
pelled to conduct the trial of a person charged with
murder. The defendant was found guilty and sen-
tenced to ten years' incarceration. Our Government
made no provision for his detention, and the unfor
tunate Consul, serving in a tropical clime at a small
salary, was compelled at his own expense to hold and
board the prisoner. He was providentially relieved,
for after several months' imprisonment his unwel
come charge died; but not a cent was ever awarded
by the Government to recompense the Consul for
either the trial or the imprisonment.
The issue is an old one, but Senator White has
treated it with an originality that gives it a new in
terest. The proposed reform is one in which all
commercial bodies should interest themselves. It
is time to make the consular service an effective part
of the Government, but the reform will never be
accomplished so long as it is left as a part of the
prey of politicians.
WORSE THAN AN ARMED FOE.
IT is to be devoutly hoped that the fever which
seems to have made its appearance among our
soldiers in Cuba will be checked by prompt and
intelligent treatment. Its coming is no surprise.
Santiago and its environs were known to reek with
the germs of the deadly malady. If it shall sweep
through the army, as sometimes it has through a
stricken city, the list of those who perish at the
hands of the armed foe will be as nothing compared
with the list of those who must perish miserably of
the scourge.
One result of the peril will be to hasten the attack
on Santiago, and make it swift and irresistible. Let
our brave boys do the work before them and then
speed from the plague spot. It will not be a cow
ardly retreat. There are horrors which even a va
liant soldier should not be called on to face. Ha
vana will be taken, but we can wait. No reinforce
ments can come to the salvation of Spain, but with
yellow fever as an ally it has more than human aid.
General Toral's idea of surrender seems to be to
walk away unmolested, carrying everything portable,
and continuing the fight later at some new point.
Probably Linares will surrender his sword as soon
as Hearst shall get near enough to receive it

years ago, and their adventures gave rise
to many an after dinner story, the dra
matis personae of which included all
three. One that has not yet appeared in
print, and which Eugene Garber took par
ticular delight In telling, is the following:
Crittenden Thornton is known among the
legal fraternity for his wonderfully reten
tive memory, especially evidenced In an
off-hand citation of cases. He would in
vite both Creswell and Garber to lunch,
and Just about the time when his guests
were awe-stricken by his remarkable dis
play of knowledge, Thornton would state
some mooted proposition of law, and ask
the opinion of both Creswell and Garber
concerning a correct solution. Ordinarily
it was some problematical question which
might have been solved In one of two
ways. When the conjectural opinion of
the catechised was wrong, Thornton, who
had primed himself upon the question,
would say: "Well, your conclusions might
be adjudged correct were it not for the
case of so and so in the United States Re
ports, and the case of so and so decided
by the Supreme Court of California in
such a year." This happened frequently,
to the mortification of both Creswell and
Garber. One fine day the under dogs laid
a plot for revenge. They discovered a
very intricate and involved legal question,
and they poured over the books until they
had at least a dozen strong cases proba
tive of the side to which they allied
themselves. Thornton was their guest
this time. The bait was dangled before
him, and after a most brilliant guess ho
stated what the law must be, according to
his interpretation, but it was not the law.
Then followed the old formula: "Yes,
your conclusions might be adjudged cor
rect were it not, etc." Eugene Garber
considered this little sally one of the hap
piest moments of his life.

JIM'S LETTERS.
Po' little Jim! I think er him,
An' somethin' in me cries.
These latter days, when there's a haze
Comes In his mother's eyes.
Jlst now an' then I see it, when
She's thlnkin' of the boy,
Who went away one summer's day.
An' tuck his mother's joy.
'Twas in the time of our prime;
Grim war was callin' loud,
"When little Jim stepped out so prim,
An' han'some, game and proud.
'Twae sorter so I couldn't go â
I had so much to do,
To work an' find for them behind.
An' see the old folks thoo.
But little Jim, whose eyes was dim,
For jes' a second's flight,
He up an' Mowed he'd be the crowd
To do the family fight.
But Jim could write as well as fight,
An' when his letters come.
Up at the head, in blue an" red.
Was flags, an life an' drum.
Indeed an' truth, that little youth
Had pictur's by the score,
An' every time he writ a line
He sent us one er more.
But Nancy said 'at when she read
What Jimmy had to tell,
It holp her thoo, for then she knew
'At he was safe an" well.
But atterwhile the faint-like smile
Of Nancy faded out;
The mall was dumbâ no letters come â
An' hope was drowned in aouDt.
The other men come home again,
But Jimmy wasn't 'long-
In battle's strife his brave young life
Had jined the hero throng.
An' now I know dear Nancy so
Her eyes with tear drops dim.
Tell me, right then, she's read again

and he will be able to furnish you all the
information about war revenue stamps.
Also about exposition stamps.
WAR REVENUE LAWâ J. R.. City.
The only portion of the war revenue law
that refers to wines is tho follow-in;?:
"Sparkling or other wines when bottled
for pale, upon each bottle of one pint or
less. 1 cent; upon each bottle containing
more than one pint, 2 cents."
MARRIAGE LICENSEâ C. W.G.,High
land Park, East Oakland. Cal. A mar

kota and Oklahoma. In Maryland legal
marriage can be had only by an ordained
minister.
THE WRONG DATEâ H. O. W., Han
ford, Cal. You have evidently made a
mistake as to the date. This department
announced that dimes of 1594, not 1^92,
coined at the San Francisco Branch Mint
command a premium. In that year there
were but twenty-four of these coined and
some parties have offered a premium of
$5 for each. It is very doubtful if any
are in circulation, for all are accounted
for, or were, a few months ago.
OIL OF THE EUCALYPTUSâ Constant \
Reader, San Jose, Cal. The leaves of the
eucalyptus yield a volatile oil that pro
duces eucalyptol, a camphor by distilla
tion. It Is an aromatic bitter, promotes dl- i
gestion, is highly antiseptic and anti-ma
larial and is valuable in atonic dyspepsia
and in intermittent fever. It is al3o used :
In bronchitis, in eardiseases and in various !
liniments and washes. Any wholesale j
drughouse can furnish additional informa
tion about the oil.
A WORLD CORRESPONDENTâAs
troIogria. City. Sylvester Scoville, a cor
respondent of the New York World, was
arrested February 5, 1897, at Tumas, j
Santa Clara Province, Cuba, and was
thrown into prison for being, it was
charged, the bearer of important papers
from President McKinley to President
Mhkso and General Gomez. He was a
long 1 time after released, and there was
some talk of the Spanish Government of- j
ferlng a reward of $10,000 for his capture i
if found again in such business.
GERMAN BATTLE-SHIPSâ I. A. S.,
San Luis Obispo, Cal. Germany has seven
first class battle -ships, four second class
and six third class. The second and third
class are ready for service, but only four
of the first class are ready. Four of the
first, two of the second and two of the
third class were in commission in the
early part of the year. The first class
vessels are: The Brandenburg, Kurfurst
Frledrich Wllhelm, Weissenburg. Woerth,
Kaiser Friedrlch 111. Konlg Wilhelm II
anu Ersatz Konig Wilhelm. The second
class are the Eaden, Balren, Sachsen and

the Deutschland, Kaiser and Oldonburg
of class A, and the Friedrlch der Grosse,
Preussen and Konig Wilhelm of class B.
THE DOOM OF SPAIN.
The correspondents all report an out
ward calm, and all mention, without quite
believing, that the graver Spaniards still
entertain hopes of peace either on the
basis of the status quo. which is noifsense,
or on the plan that Spain should grant
independence to Cuba, that Washington
should guarantee the Cuban debt, and
that Madrid should retain Porto Rico and
the Philippines. These childish ideas are,
however, all based either on ignorance aa
to the current of events, which is diligent
ly fostered by the Ministry, who daily
feed the people with wind, or on the fancy
that because Mr. Mcl^inley detests blood
shed, he can therefore make a peace
which his whole nation would regard as
ridiculous or shameful. The truth, how
ever, must filter down, however slowly;
and our conviction that when that truth
is realized and nothing more is hoped
from Admiral Cervera, Spain, and especi
ally Southern Spain, will explode in a
burst of revolutionary passion, remains
unchanged.
The people consider, not without justice,
that they have been "betrayed," not in
deed by this government, but by a suc
cession of governments, dating from IS4S.
An, enormous debt has been created, mil
lions have been voted for armaments, the
children of Spain have been taken for the
army, more especially of late. In scores of
thousands, and nevertheless the magnifi
cent country, full of wealth and seated on
two seas, has been left without any ade
quate means of defense. Its navy was
hardly fit for a battle, its army of 200,000
men failed to subdue a colony which
never collected 30,000 Insurgents for its
war of liberation. The popular judgment
attributes much of this almost Chinese in
efficiency to Intrigue, and much mere to
corruption, and will, as we believe, most
assuredly demand an account, which is
not likely, the rational character being
what it is, to be liquidated without blood
shed.
We expert a terrible outbreak in Spain.
and our judgment is in no May modified
by the statements that the ruling classes
of the cities expect nothing of the kind
that they believe the army can and will'
protect them ,and that the tide of amuse
ment shows as deen a volume as ever
The theaters were all open in Paris? while
the tumbrils were rolling toward thf> guil
lotine, and would be open next week if the
plague were carrying off GOO men a day.
We pity the Queen Regent, who is a good
woman, and a brave; we pity the present
government, which has been guilty only
of untruthfulness, and is possibly un
truthful to itself as well as to Its sup
porters, and we pity Spain itself, which is
responsible only for part of its misfor
tunes; but if there is one truth more cer
tain than another, it is that men inherit
misfortunes as well as fortunes, or, as the
old Hebrew put it. that "the fathers have
eaten sour grapes, and the childen's
teeth are set on edge."â The Spectator.
THE LINE OF FIRE.
The remark attributed to Admiral Dew
ey by a correspondent of the London
Dally Telegraph may be authentic or may
be apocryphal. We do not know. It does
not particularly matter. What Is cer
tain Is that it might well be authen
tic, and It is characteristic and signifi
cant. The admiral is said to have told
Prince Henry of Prussiaâ presumably on
a certain interesting occasion at Hong
kongâthat he would be glad to see any
German officers at Manila, "but It would
be well to caution them to keep out of the
American line of fire." There are some
grounds for doubting whether he made
such a remark. But at least It sounds
much like him, and it Is superbly ex
pressive of the American spirit In this
war and of the attitude of this nation
toward the world.
The Interest of other nations In the war
in both hemispheres. Is not to be denied.
In a measure every civilized nation is in
terested in everything that is done by or
is done to every other nation, fhe hack
neyed boast of P. Terentius \ arro is to*'
be applied to States as well as to indi
vfdual men. But then our interests are
cZeme and paramount above all others
put together. It is our war, and no
other's and It is our war with Spain, and
with no other. The line of fire Is between
the United States and Spain and nowhere

THE WORLD'S CREDITOR.
Once more the balance of foreign tradÂ«
surpasses the expectations which even
the most hopeful ventured to indulge. It
! was said some weeks ago that exports in
May would probably run about $100,000,000
and exceed imports by at least 000 000
Rut the actual exports were $110,239,206 in
value and exceeded imports by $56,980,359.
In seven of the ten months since the new
tariff went into effect the exports have
i exceeded $100,000,000. and the total excess
! over imports in those months has been
! 459 828 That no other such year has
ever rejoiced this people it is needless to
say The obvious conclusion cannot be
avoided that protective duties do not.pre
vent heavy exports, as many theorists
have long argued, nor have they in this
instance operated mainly by prohibition
of prevention of imports, for the Prosper
ity of the country has been so great that,
even with the home market tor -many
kinds of goods almost entirely secure a to
domestic producers the aggregate of im
ports has declined less than was ex P|Â«_
cd. It is mainly in creating and mam
taining that general prosperity that the
Ch i rifVo f r^ rl w ff hr,fto ha nlotf^atn l otf^at in eleven
months ending with May more than a
quarter of the exports have been oi
of mineral oil $50,198,715. Meanwhile other
domestic exports have amounted to 5^Â».
lffi I. against $352 547.200 in the same
months of the previous year. It is well
i known how great the expansion has been
:in some of the other exportsâ in iron
1 products about $10,000,000. in hops over
$1,000,000 and in copper and fruits eacn.
1 about $1,000,000. in oilcake over $2.000 ,000
and as much in cottonseed oil, ana nearly
|2W)0W)0 in paper, besides substantial
gains in many other articles. .spite ot
the vastly increased home demand during
the last eleven months, American pro
ducers have been able also to supply
largely increased quantities for export.
! A difference of $554,459,528 between ex
; ports and imports in value during ten
months has not been due in large meas
ure to fradulent undervaluation of im
ports, though such frauds still exist and
! are of importance, in spite of the more
i general use of specific instead of ad va
! lorem duties under the new tariff. Prob
! ably a material portion has been cut otf.
so that instead of more than $60,000,000
such undervaluations have been reduced
! below $30 000,000 for these months. - JBut
this affects but little the enormous bal
ance. Neither have specie imports
squared the account, though of gold alone
the net imports in ten months have been
! more than $100,000,000â 5106,202,403â the
1 greatest net gain ever attained in the
whole of any previous year having been
I $97,043,127 in ISB2. The net exports of sil
ver, $20,043,351 in ten months, have been
1 larger in several years, and reduce tho
: balance received .in specie against mer
: chandise account to about $86,000,000. It
, I there be further added the undervalua
! 'â  tlons, and about $40,000,000 for interest and
, 1 dividends due abroad, only $156,000,000
would appear to have been canceled,
leaving almost $400,000,000 yet to be met
by return of securities to this country or
in some other way.â New York Tribune.
THE CENSUS OF 1900.
There is a controlling reason why tho
next census should be taken by experta
selected after competitive examination,
and not be complicated with partisan pol
itics, and that is the benefit of the coun
try. The census has nothing to do -with
politics or policies. It is purely a statis
tical work, and what those who do it
think on the tariff or currency does not
count "What is wanted is the best possi
ble corps of men to take the most ac
curate census at the least expense. A3 â¢
one census is hardly complete before pre- I
paration for a new one begins, a perma- '
nejit bureau, with an expert forcp. is de

WAR HURRICANE WARNINGS.
An Interesting indication of the Govern

sent out last Thursday by the central of

patches announced that an application
had been made for an appropriation of
$75,000 with which to establish a cordon of
stations along the Windward Islands and
the northern coast of South America.
The occasion just vow for taking this
step was to be prepared to give the com

1,. A. Thurston, ex-Mtnlster of Hawaii,
end F. M. Hatch, the present Minister,
to.'k their departure for the islands last
evening on the steamer Alanieda, but be
fore they left they expressed their opin
ions â  -! Important topics rela
tive to the annexation of the Sandwich
-, and the future relations to this
city and State.
In their remarks they were bo enthusi
astic for the future prosperity of the isl
ands that they overlooked the effect that
such prosperity would have upon the city
by the Gol lea Gate. In plowing terms
Mr. Thunston pictured a mnpiiflcent coal
ing station f ir the United States far out
in the middle of the PacirV and called at
m to what a splendid naval and mili
tary outpost this little group of Islands
would make. "The city of Honolulu," he
sn:.i, "has no protection against inva-
Blon." And udded, "We are not concern
ing ourselves ab< ut this. The United
States Government will attend to the
matter of fortifying the weak places that
arc* most exposed to attack, should a hos
%'.]â¢â¢ i â â¢ wer ever take a notion to pay the
islands a visit."
"Would it not also be necessary to
maintain a number of war vessels in
those waters? 1 was asked.
"Certainly, [n the present war it has
â  ed that fortification* without
war ships art- of but little service, as
again:-: a fleet of cruisers. The Govern

like Mr. Thurston, he is willing to leave
the detailsâ and cost â of such matters to

B< th gentlemen have the belief that
Honolulu has a glorious future when the
igua canal is complete. Upon this
subject Mr. Tburston said: "With a ca
ble across the Pacific that city will be a
place- where every vessel in those waters
wiil stop for instructions and to confer
with the home offices by wire. Every
ship going through the canal, either to
or from Astatic ports, will stop at the
Island? for news. We expect to have one
of th" busiest harbors In the world. Situ
atf-d as we a;v In the middle of the ocean,
we \\ i visit from every vessel
frÂ»m the eastern coast of the " United
States and Kuropo going through the
Nicaragua canal, bound for Asiatic
port*,"
Mr. Hate!: agreed with these views, on
xpatiated in a manner showing
that he ex] <â â¢ la :â > completely cut the port
of Pan Francisco out of all trade coming
through th- transcontinental waterwayâ
the canal. "There :'re some people who
argue that will stek the shortest
way from the canal on this side of the
continent to Asia by taking In the 'great
circle," which would lead them away to
the north. This is all nonsense. Ships
Sestined for Asia will take to the smootn
pst waters, wh'.-re they will have fewer
norms to contend with, and where they
will avoid the Japan current, and this
way is directly to the Sandwich Islands.
Ships bound for Australia will take the
;ame course. Yes; we have a great fu
ture."
"It looks as though San Francisco
would be entirely cut out of all this
trade?" was suggested.
"Yes," answered Mr. Hatch, Blo\rly, and
added: "But the Islands will not be as a
foreign country. They will be a part of
;h< I'nited States."
If the df-sirfs of these two gentlemen
ire fulfilled there will be a big exodus of
farmers from the Unitc-d States with
money to invest in Island lands soon
after annexation. They wish to see as
ninny of this class settle in the Hawaiian
islands as possible. Mr. Hatch suggested
that they could work on the co-operative
plan, raising small lots of cane, which
they could p^II to the factories. Th>- cane

WILL SING PATRIOTIC SONGS.
Mrs, Annls Montaaue Turner, Who Will Take Part
in the Fall of the Bastile Celebration at the
Chutes This Afternoon. .
The committee from the French Society and the Red Cross Society who
attended the rehearsal of the musical numbers to be given at the Chutes are
all most enthusiastic in their praise of Mrs. Montague Turner's strong sweet
voice and her Intensely dramatic rendition of American national songs. Mrs.
Montague Turner is a native of Honolulu and a sister of Mrs. Samuel Alexander
of Oakland. She makes her first appearance in this city as one of the "an
nexed" citizens. She received her education in Paris and has been for some
years conducting her own opera company in the Australian cities.
which the islands have had an unenviable
reputation.
Mr. Thurston said that there are now
about 35.000 coolies from China and Japan
there, of which number 22,000 work on the
sugar plantations. Of these 9000 are what
are known as contract laborers, that is,
chattels who have been induced to leave
their native lands under contract to labor
in the cane fields for a stated period for a
certain small wage. When asked what
effect these coolies under contract would
have upon free white labor coming from
the States, the gentleman hastened to say
that the contract system is rapidly dying
out. and now only consists of an agree
ment between the contractor and the la
borer that the latter shall be under obli
gation to pay to the former the price of
the fare from the coolies' home to the
islands. "We hope," said Mr. .Ihurston,
"that the effect of annexation will be to
increase the scale of laborers' wages all
over the islands. We are sure that white
men can go there and make a good living,
for all the presence of those who are now
, "â¢V^iat'is the general run of wages paid
in the Hawaiian Islands?"
"The average wage is $12 50 a month ana
found. The straight wage Is about $17.
It Is on such wages as these that they
expect to induce white laborers to leave
the States and go to the Islands, where
they will have to compete with coolies,
thousands of whom are under contract
for a length of time "for passage money.
After a little further conversation about
the great possibilities of the new territory
when the Government makes the neces
sary improvements and the people with
money flock there for investments, the
gentlemen hurried away to pack up for
the trip to the new Territory.

DR. M'NUTT
NOT INSOLVENT
Says His Reported Fail
ure Is Untrue.
A TRUST DEED REDEEMED
PAYS A DEBT IN FAVOR OF THE
JOHNSON ESTATE.
The Alleged Sacrifice of the Sanita
rium on Sutter Street in
Favor of Creditors
Denied.
Dr. TV. F. McNott, who it was claimed
was financially embarrassed and com
pelled to sacrifice his real estate interests
in order to satisfy the demands of his
creditors, denies the report as groundless
and without the least foundation of
truth.
In speaking of his alleged failure last
evening he said: "Every line that was
published about my being In financial
straits is false. The entire report was based
upon a conference that Attorney McEn
erney had with the trustees of the Johnson
estate t.iis afternoon, concerning the
proper adjustment to be made relative to
my gaining possession of tne lot situated
on the southerly line of California street,
above Van Ness avenue, the site of my
former residence.
"Just prior to J. C. Johnson's death I
grave a trust deed on the property In Ms
fuvor. the agreement being that the
money obtained would be devoted toward
removing the building on the site to Sut
ter street and the proper alterations and
additions made in converting the entire
structure to suit the purposes of a pri
vate sanitarium. The money obtained
from the building was to be devoted to
the payment of the value of the deed
given me to Johnson. This agreement
wus strictly adhered to until the time of
Johnson's death, when, In the adjustment
of his estate, my property was included
a.s a portion of It.
"It was to regain the possession of the
lot that my lawyer held a conference
this morning," said McNutt, "with the
trustees of the Johnson estate. After a
short deliberation I concluded to deed
over another piece of property In order to
be released from the necessity of sacrific
ing the site of my old home on California
street. Beyond this transaction, how
ever, there was nothing done, as there
was absolutely no need for me to ar
range my estate to the satisfaction of
supposed creditors, because beyond the
Johnson heirs. I have none.
"The remark that the sanitarium !s
Included In the property deedsd to the
Johnson estate for the release of the
California-street property is untrue. The
building, which at present Includes my
home, was never In better condition
financially, and It Is the last possession
that 1* hold that I would think of dis
posing of. The demands of the trustees
of the Johnson estate have already been
siitisfled and the .deed given by me to i
Johnson personally is redeemed, which j
means tha full payment of my entire in
debtedness. Beyond the public record of
the redemption of this deed I don't think
that the public has any right to meddle
with my affairs. If I want to sell or
even mortgage a piece of property It Is
my own business, and should be consid
ered such by those prying Into my affairs
to find a loophole for general gossip."
The reported Indebtedness of Dr. Mc-
Nutt Is $140,000, nearly three-fourths of
which Is claimed to be held In mortgages'
by the various city banks.

HOW MAC BUNKOED MAGUIRE
A COMMITTEE TO SHELLGAME
THE FAITHFUL.
No Pi-imary to Be Held, but Dele
gates Will Be Appointed by
the Confidence
Men.
A meeting of the committee of one hun
dred, which has taken upon itself the task
of doing the thinking for the twenty-five
or thirty thousand Democrats of this city,
has been called for next Tuesday evening.
What the programmers intend to do
they have kept to themselves. It has .
leaked out, however, that no primary will
be held, but the delegates to the State and
municipal convention will be appointed.
Whether the county will stand for this
remains to be seen. One prominent mem
ber of the one hundred, who yet believes i
in the Democratic doctrine that the ma- j
jorlty should rule, recently remarked that
he did not Intend to remain on the com
mittee unless the party could be united.
As he very tersely put it, he did not in
tend to belong to a faction of the party.
It seems that the only chance of an united
party is to hold a primary. The Harney-
Itea "or Raineyites, as the purifiers and
Pharisees delight to call them, have of
fered to hold a primary with the officers
chosen by the one hundred, and under
such restrictions ami regulations as they
may direct and establish. But at this
proposal, the Braunharts, Poppers and
McNabs, in the language of Honore An
nanias Lalne's euolgist "sniffed con
temptuously" and loftily said that It
would be impossible to hold a fair prim
ary in San Francisco.
In virtually saying that the masses were
unable to think for themselves, these gen
tlemen have declared that government by
the people is a failure. They evidently
know a good thing when they see It and
intend to use the power which they fool
ishly think they have.
It Is said that the "entente cordlale
does not now exist between the Governor
and "Whispering" Gavin, and the reason
fur Budd's distrust of the wily Scot may
be explained In the following story, which
has been told around for same years past.
It is as follows:
"Before the Democratic Convention of
IS<4 assembled, the delegates from this
city were instructed by the appointing
power to vote for Judge Magulre for any
position to which he might aspire. It to
not known then whether he would desiro
to be returned to Congress or make the
race for Governor. When the convention
met Budd and Barney Murphy were the
leaMng candidates. McNab was in Budd s
camp. After a thorough canvass of the
cltv delegates, he discovered that a great
many of them would vote for Murphy if
Maguire was not In the race. He there
upon announced that to prevent this It
was necessary to put Maguire into the
fight He at once wired the Congressman,
got his consent and placed him In nom
ination, knowing that he would bo
slaughtered, and doing it for the sole pur
pose of helping Budd. Budd knew this
he is a shrewd man and a good judge of
human nature. He knows that a man
who would betray a friend would do the
"Judas" act again, hence his distruÃt of
Gavin."

Of whose characteristics, personality,
fortunes and moral condition this verse
was written It matters not, but it aptly
tells the story of the position at present
occupied by one Isaiah W. Lees, known
here and there as the present Chief of the
Police Department, In an action now being
heard by Judge Hunt. The suit was orig
inally brought by John J. O'Malley
against the State of California and
Isaiah W. Lees, to recover $1000, which
amount was offered by Governor H. H.
Markham for the apprehension and con
viction of the murderer of F. 11. L. Weber
and his wife, Lizzie M. Weber. A short
time ago, however, the action as to the
defendant, I. VY. Lets, was dismissed, by
reason of the fact that Lees' claim to the
money had been weighed in the balance
and found wanting, but If he did not get
the money the scheming Chief is loth to
be deprived of the glory accompanying
the arrest, conviction and execution of thÂ«
brutal murderer, and he is an able ally
of tfye State in consequence. The man who
undoubtedly deserves the credit and the
reward offered for the apprehension of the
murderer is a carpenter of peculiar name,
Wladislaw Zakrewskei. He has assigned
the claim to the plaintiff, John J. O'Mal
ley, and O'Malley will make the fight for
the spoils in court.
In December of 1594 the whole State
was shocked by the. report of the foul
murder of Weber and his wife in their
home in Sacramento. Mystery veiled the
tragedy. No motive of any great conse
quence could be assigned for the murder
of husband and wife, and but a slender
clew was left by the assassin, who im
mediately fled from the scene- of his
! ghastly crime. Officers were groping in
i the dark for some thread that would put
! them on the track of the murderer, but as
they seemed to be making no headway
Governor Markham, in order to stimu
late the energies of the public, offered a
reward to any man who wou*d bring the
assassin to Justice.

â  tion offering the reward for the arrest of
i the murderer of the Webers was Zakrew
skie, the carpenter. He had heard that
I it was the opinion that a Russian was
j the criminal wanted, and as he was a na
, live of that far away land and had a
j large number of fellow countrymen he
! counted as his friends whom he knew
j would lend him aid he set to work. His
I suspicions fastened upon three men he
> knew were in the neighborhood of the
| crime at the time of its commission, and
|he set out to Hunt them up. They were
! Ivan Kovalev, George Putalla and one
Levin.
Zakrewskei hunted for f-ome time be
fore he cornered his men, and then set to
j v.-ork to gain their eonidenc?. He had
! known Kovalev for many months prior to
I the commission of the crime of which he
I suspected him, and he was soon on the
. most intimate terms with him. Time
\ passed und llnally when the carpenter
j was sure of his game he confronted Ko
; valev and accused him of the murders.
i Kovalev was nonplused at the accusa
> tion, but, still believing that Zakrewskei
j would prove his friend and shield him
from the law, he confessed.
He told the story in detail to Zakrews
keiâhow in the dark of the night, while
the old couple were resting in content in
their rooms, he had skulked in and
dashed out their brains. The carpenter
worked cleverly, and one night, when the
murderer was sleeping soundly in a room
in this city, he conducted two police oiti-
I cers to the place, directed them to the
I room in which the murderer was sleep
ing, and then stood guard at the door to
prevent his escape. The officers had no
difficulty In placing the assassin in irons,
and he was marched to prison.
Patalla and Levin were likewise be
trayed into the hands of the authorities
but on examination they were released It

being proven that they had no connection
with tno crime. Kovalev, however, had
confessed the crime to the man who
closed the prison door upon him and he
was returned to the scene of the tragedy
for trial. The strongest witness against
him was Zakrewskel, and when the jury
returned from Its deliberations It found
the prisoner guilty of murder of the first
degree. The law was allowed to run its
course and the man, who on the night of
December 29, 1894, murdered an old couple
while they slept, went to the scaffold to
his end.
All of these facts Zakrewskei testified to
yesterday on the stand, but he made no
mention of the effort of Lees to cheat him
of the glory accompanying the arrest
of the murderer as well as the reward
offered by the Governor. Lees will also
probably refrain from mentioning the
facts when he takes the stand on Dehalf
of the State to-day.
That is another story. Kovalev had no
sooner been convicted than Lees took a
trip to Sacramento to collect the reward.
In Sacramento, however, a deaf ear was
turned on his pleadings for the reward,
and he took the matter to the courts.
It was carried to the Supreme Court, and
there it was held (the court failing to so
into the merits of Lees' claim) that,
In any event, he was not entitled to col
lect the reward, as he was paid to catch
murderers and all criminals, and even in
the event that he was instrumental in
securing Kovalev's arrest, he had only
done his duty and must content himself
with the salary he received for that work,
a salary. In the mind of the public, much
too large for a man unable to properly
fulfill the duties involved In the position
ho occupies.
Notwithstanding the fact that everyone
acquainted with the circumstances sur
rounding the arrest of tne murderer of
the Webers is cognizant of the fact that
Lees had nothing to do with the arrest of
Kovaltv, that official refuses to surrender
the glory, even though his heart was
broken when the courts refused to give
him a reward that in justice was not his.
He had not earned it and if he had, the
law said that he should not collect it. In
answer to the paragraph of the complaint
in which it is stated that Lees had noth
ing to do with the arrest, the Chief simply
"denies that the defendant, Isaiah W.
Lees, did not arrest, nor participate in the
arrest, of Ivan Kovalev." That is all the
defense, he makes, but the world will un
derstand. He tried to "patch up his
fame," but miserably failed.

Midweek Theater Notes.
"Faust" is having a big run at
the Alcazar this week. The piece has
never been more perfectly staged as re
gards mechanical and electrical effects
than it now is. Mr. Morrison in his fa
vorite role is at his best, and in Miss
Florence Roberts he finds a lady capable
of bidding for first-place honors, in her
very excellent rendition of the character
of Marguerite.
At the Columbia the Frawley Company
will continue in the amusing comedy.
"Lostâ 24 Hours," for the remainder of
the week, including Saturday matinee.
The members of the company are doing
excellent work and the play is very laugh
able. On Monday night it will give way
to "Liberty Hall," a prettny told com
edy, with a particularly attractive love
story, by R. C. Carton, which calls for a
greater amount of character work than
any play yet put on by the company.
Theodore Roberts as Old Todman, Cora
Tinnie as the slave, Crafer, and Louis
Payne and Maude Winters as the eccen
tric brother and sister, should be particu
larly fine. The advance sale of seats is
good.
"Fatinltza" at the Tlvoli is drawing
well, and is very prettily presented, both
in the singing and acting. It will be
succeeded next week by a requested re
vival of Planquette's popular work, "The
Bells of Corneville," which will be given
in the usual good style of the manage
ment. , .
The attendance at Morosco s is good
proof that the patrons of the house are
highly pleased with the presentation of
"The Romany Rye." It is ably acted,
splendidly staged and highly entertain
ing
The Chutes will have one of the great
est events in its history this day and
evening in the celebration of the Fall of
the Bastile. Elaborate preparations have
been made for the very delightful occa
sion. ' â

REGULARS EMBARK FOR MANILA TO-DAY
TROOPS AT BOTH CAMPS
STRIKE TENTS AT
EIGHT.
TWO BATTALIONS OF THE FIRST
NEW YORK REGIMENT ARRIVE.
FINE BEARING OF THE MEN
ADMIRED.
AN Important event of the war,
from a local point of view)
will be the embarkation to
day for Manila of six troops,
Fourth Fnited States Cavalry.
\ squadron of four troops belonging to
this renownr-d regiment has been on
July in California since 1890. In sum
time the troopers have patrolled
the flanks of the Sierra, guarding the
Witional parks and protecting the tim
:esorves from depredation. In
printer garrison duty has been perform
ed at the Presidio. The regimental
representation of. young Californians
is large, hence; scenes touched with
?athos -will attend the marching of the
troopers to-day from the reservation
:hrough the city to the steamship Peru
it the Pacific Mail dock.
The Fourth Cavalry is a famous regi
ment. Many general officers, now oc
cupying high positions at the front, and
Tiar.y other gallant but fallen soldiers
In whose memory monuments have
ted to record their de^ds of
heroism and loyalty, served in this
reidmont and their renown is part of
the regimental history.
When the "general" Is sounded at the
Presidio this morning at 8 o'clock the
will fall simultaneously in one di
rection. There will be music and ten
der leavetakings at the garrison for
pome little time, and at 9 o'clock the
Drder will be given to march. The Ma
nila squadron, dismounted, will be es
corted to the steamship by the mount
BENNI NGTON TO SAIL TO-DAY
All night long the heaving of coal into the hold of the Ben
nington foretold the departure of that ship to-day. Orders were sent
from Washington a few days ago that the Bennington should get
under â¢way at once, and since that time the decks of the gunboat
have been a scene of rushing activity. Admiral Miller was seen last
night, but refused to tell definitely the destination of the Benning
ton. He confessed that she was not ordered to the Philippines or the
Ladrone Islands. By a process of exclusion it is easily reasoned out
that the Bennington has but one rational destination, and that is
Honolulu. At any rate, that is the general belief, and there is some
strong authority for this opinion
Lieutenant Commander Moser has been ordered to command
the Bennington, replacing Commander Nichols, who has been con
demned by medical survey. Commander Nichols has been ill for
some time and his poor health has forced him to retire. Lieutenant
Curtis of the Bennington will command the Albatross, formerly in
command of Lieutenant Commander Moser. Admiral Miller will sail
on the Philadelphia, which will leave for Honolulu between the
20th and 25th inst. He has not yet received instructions from
Washington concerning the ceremonies attendant upon the absorp
tion of the ' Hawaiian Government into the Union. The Bennington
will steam out of our harbor this afternoon.
Ed band of the regiment and Troop B,
mounted, under command of Lieuten
ant Neia.lL The route of march will
be along Lombard street- to Van Ness
avenue, thence to Golden Gate avenue,
thence to Market street and along
Market to Third or Second street to the
f-asiest thoroughfare leading to the
Mai! dock.
The following order for breaking
ramp was issued by Colonel Kellogg
yesterday:

Since tho beginning of tho war many
tributes have been paid to tho discip
line and loyalty of the troops going to
the front, but no organization of sol
diers in the field or in garrison is com
posed of better material than that em
belied In the Fourth Cavalry. Every
troop of the Manila command contains
tho full complement allowed by law.
During the past month many applica
tions for enlistment, sustained by high
influences, have been rejected. In the
two troops performing duty in the Yel
lowstone National Park there are sev
eral vacancies, but every troop at the
Presidio Is recruited to the maximum,
and good men desiring to enlist are
turned away every day. Many of the
recruits accepted since the beginning
of the present war brlong to families
well known In the country and some
of the youngsters are sure to Inherit
fortunes If they safely pass through the
ordeal of conflict.
Light Ratteries D and G of the Sixth
United States Artillery will also leave
the Presidio at 9 o'clock this morning
to embark on the steamer Peru. This
battalion, in command of Major Gru
gan, is composed of excellent men who
are eager for active service at the
front.
The troops from Camp Merritt will
not proofed to their ships in a body, as
they will be obliged to take different
routes. Major Robe of the Fourteenth
United States Infantry will lead his
men along Point Lob"s avenue to Cen
tral avenue and down Post street to
Market and from Market to the Pu
ebla, via East street.
The troops for the Peru will follow
the same route as far as Market street,
where they will cross to Second street,
thence to the Mail dock.
All day yesterday the troops at Camp
M< rritt that will sail to-morrow were
busy packing aboard the Puebla and
the Peru their commissary and quar
termaster supplies. This morning at 8
o'clock they will break camp and by 10
o'clock they will be aboard their trans
ports. The arm: vans will be on hand
at 7:30 to take to the docks the tents
and balance of unloaded equipment. It
will take the r tter part of the day to
get everything aboard.
VOLUNTEERS FROM
THE EMPIRE STATE
Arrival and Reception of the
First New York Regiment
Destined for Honolulu.
The First Provisional Regiment of New
York Infantry, better known as the First
New York Volunteers, 131S men strong,
under command of Colonel Thomas H.
Barber, made its triumphal entry into
San Francisco yesterday. Amid the
cheers of thousands of enthusiastic cit-
I izens, who vied with one another in ac
cording to the soldiers from the Empire
State a glorious welcome, th.- first two de
tachments marched up Market street and
out to Camp Merritt.
Tho regiment left Jersey City at 3::!0
o'clock last Thursday afternoon. It re
quired a train of forty-one cars, includ
ing sleepers and baggage ears, to trans
port th<- command, and this was divided
into four sections with an Interval of fif
teen minutes between each. Owing to
the fact that the third and fourth-s ect
ions did not get int.. Oakland until late
yesterday evening they remained across
the bay for the night and will proceed to
Camp Merritt this morning.
The welcome given Colonel Barber and
his men was one <>r the warmest that
dan Francisco lias extended to any reg
iment that has come here. Right 'richly
were the New York soldiers deserving of
th.- hospitality that was extended to
them, and they fully merited all of the
honors and courtesies shown them.
Th>- volunteers are the picked soldiers
of their native State and from their sol
dierly hearing and geneni appearance
the Empire State has a just right to be
proud of her sons that have been sent
so far beyond tho confines of her borders
The First comes fully prepared and
equipped for field service. The regiment
in bt-ing commanded by Colonel Barber
has at its head a regular retired army of
ncer, who has seen eighteen years of
active s^rvi<,. with the Kirst Tnited
States Artillery. The oth<-r officers, in
cluding Lieutenant Colonel SUicpole and
Majors (_ base, Krnmett and Scott, with
the company commanders, ar;j officers of
long experience in the National Guard of
New ),">-k, and are thoroughly capable
and efficient in every way. The rank and
Hie ol the regiment represents a body of
men each one of whom has been chosen,
after a severe physical examination for
his peculiar atnesa for the rigorous du
ties that fall to the private in the ranks.
They an- men of line physical proportions
and unusual intelligence and in the ranks
are to be found the sons of some of the
oldest and most influential families in
the State of New York.
The men are as well drilled to-day as
any regular regiment in the service, for
with the exception of a few recruits, all
of them have seen several years of ser
vice in the llnest military organizations
composing New York's National Guard
They were encamped at Camp Black for
over a month, and for the past six weeks
have been doing garrison duty at Forts
Wadswurth and Hamilton and Governors
Island.
It was exactly 6:10 o'clock when the
first section, consisting' of ten sleepers
rolled into the Southern Pacific depot at
Oakland. The soldier boys soon made
known their arrival by loud" and prolonged
cheers for San Francisco. Captain Put
nam Bradlee Strong, who was detailed by
General Marcus P. Miller to escort tho
regiment to camp, reported to Colonel
Barber, and in a few moments Companies
M, G and H were formed upon the plat
form and ready to march. With this sec-.
lion were the officers of the three com
panies named, and also Comparlr-s F, E
and C; while the officers of the rwmalnini
six companies of the regiment did not ge
in until 7:46 o'clock, when the third sec

tlon arrived. The second section reach-od
Oakland at 12:40 o'clock and wore immedi
ately escorted over the ferry and to ("amp
Merritt by Captain Strong. Both the flrst
and Becond sections were given a royal
welcome by the ladies of the Bed Cross"
Society at "the Ferry Building. The last
section did not arrive until after 10 o'clock
last night, and it. with the third, remain
ed over night in their cars, under the com
mand of Lieutenant Colonel Stacpola, and
they will come over early this morning
and proceed out to join their comrades at
Camp Merritt.
Colonel Barber said to a Call representa
tive: "We left Jersey City at 3:30 o'clock
last Thursday afternoon, and have had a
most pleasant but somewhat tiresome trip
out. There was no sickness among- our
men or any incidents worthy of notice, ex
cept that my section, the lirst. ran .Into a
Hock of sheep near Cheyenne, killing
about 200 of them. \V> were running very
rapidly at the time and that was all that
saved us from being derailed. My com
mand Is thoroughly equipped and we are
anxious to go at once to Honolulu or the
Philippines, and hope to be sent to one or
the other."
The First Provisional Regiment of New
York Infantry la by force of circum
stances one of the best organized an.l
drilled body of men that has yet been
called upon to defend this country. The
reason is not hard to find. The regiment
is composed of companies chosen from
the pick of the various crack military or
ganizations from over the entire State of
New York. Governor Black, in organiz
ing this regiment, hud in view the pur
pose of giving the finest companies in the
State representation. With the exception
of companies A. B, C and D, which were
the famous Tenth Battalion of Albany.
the other companies have been selected
from the crack companies of the State. Jn
addition to Albany. I'tica. Walton. Oneon
ta, Blnghamton, Middle town, Poughkeep
sle. Newburg and Kingston are repre
sented In the regiment. The men are
thoroughly equipped and recruited up to
the required strength of 106 mm to the
company. The only equipment wiih which
they ari- not supplied are the canvas uni
forms and the helmets, and these will be
furnished to them before they leave for
li lulU.
The First was mobilized at Camp
Black on May 2. and eighteen days later.
May 20. the reKiment was mustered into
the service. On June 11, after the with
drawal of the artillery from Forts Wads
worth and Hamilton and Governors Is
land, the First was temporarily scattered
for the purpose of garrisoning these
places. Five companies were sent to ear! 1 ,
of the forts and two to Governors Island
for the nurpose of protecting the harbor.
It was commented upon that the regiment
wan without a band, but such is nut the
ease. The band lias Just been organized
and consists of twenty-two members. The
Instruments were pureha~< j d by a general
subscription among the olJicers, to which
Colonel Barber was a generous contrib
utor.
Inasmuch as the various company com- I c
manders of the regiments came from dif- t
ferent and separate commands. Colonel c
Barber was ordered to allow the captains t
t. determine their respective rank In the >
regiment by drawing lots for them. This i
Was done and while it was as fair for one
as it was for another, still it has had the ;
effect of placing some of the captains 1
who have been In the service a compara- t
tively short time ahead of tnoso who have (
seen a much longer service. There is no i
friction as a n-sult of this and, in fact, i â¢
only the best "f feeling and regard for i ;
each other exists among the officers.
The muster roll of the commissioned of
ficers <>f the regiment, including the colo
nel and his field and staff. Is as follows:
Colonel. Thomas Henry Barber; lieuten
ant colonel 11. P. Staepole; majors.
Thomas H. Chase, Walter Scott and Rob

Clarence Btrevell; quartermaster, First
Lieutenant Bronson Winthrop; surgeon

gray, while ho. wears a clean-shaven face

of life, being just 50 years of age. He was
appointed a cadet to West Point in lst>3

â¢Major General Otis Packs Up To-Day
and Expects to Sail To-Morrow
on the Peru.
The Philippine expeditionary troops assigned to the transports Peru and
City of Puebla will embark to-day, but when they will sail has not been
definitely settled. It is the Intention of Major General Otis, however, to have
them leave to-morrow, even if It is Friday. General Otis is waiting for
some documents by mail from Washington, nut as he is very anxious to get
â¢ if!' he says he will not wait much longer. "When asked last evening
when he would sail, he said: "I am yet in the dark as to the day. but
hope to go on Friday. I shall have all my office papers, books and other ar
ticles packed on Thursday, and put on board the Peru by Friday morning."
He stated that he knew nothing positive as yet regarding what he is to
do at Honolulu, and the inference is that he is waiting to receive instruc
tions in regard to the Hawaiian annexation proceedings in which he is ex
pected to take part, together with the troops that go with him. In all prob
ability the Peru and City of Puebla will remain at Honolulu until joined by
the Pennsylvania, the Rio' Janeiro and the St. Paul, which will sail from San
Francisco inside of ten days, and froni Honolulu the whole fleet will proceed
In company to Manila.
A dispatch from Washington states that the Government has purchased
the steamer Arizona from the North Pacilic Steamship Company for a per
manent transport, and that the vessel has been ordered to sail immediately
from Puget Sound to San Francisco. This steamer will probably carry the
First Regiment of New York Volunteers tn Honolulu, although there is
some talk of sending them on the Pennsylvania. As the Hawaiian Commis
sioners- Senators CuUom and Morgan and Representative Hittâ will not sail
for Honolulu until August 10. there is really no need of any rush in the mat
ter of sending troops to the Islands before that date. The Peking, the Aus
tralia, and the Sidney will return from Manila on or about August 3, and it
is intimated that perhaps the Peking will carry the New Yorkers to Hono
lulu.
Major General Otis has given out that all the so-called Philippine expe
ditionary forces arc to lie sent to Manila, so that the troops who have
been worried by the probability of their remaining here for guard duty ".a.n
now stop their fretting.

this .county under the new army tactics
was that of the Eightn Regiment this
evening. There was no announcement,
but the large crowd which gathers daily

the- new feature immensely. Colonel Park

his ability to make himself heard, de

The Finance Chairman Offers to Resign to
Save Troubleâ Grand Jury Asked to
Investigate Charges.
. The recent scandal In the Board of Edu
cation, caused by charges made against
Chairman Burns of the Buildings and
Grounds Committee by Chairman Gal
lagher of the Finance Committee, and
which resulted In the resignation of
Director Drucker from the former com
mittee, has resulted in a serious strain
of the harmonious relation* hltnerto
existing among the friendly nine.
Just what is behind the individual ac
tion of the board yesterday remains to
be explained by their future actions.
It was naturally expected that Chair
man Hur:-.s would be present at the meet
ing, but h^ found it convenlnnt to be ab
pfnt and by bo iioinp prevented any de
clsivc action the board may have had in
contemplation.
During the rending of the minute
President Barrington handed n Blip o
paper to each member, on Which wa
â written a request to agree to servo 01
either the Finance cr Buildings commit
tevÂ«. To the surprise of Mr. Barrington
not a member Would siprn. At the prope
time he notified the chair that the resig
nation of Director Drucker from '.h
Buildings Committee had left only Chaii
man Burns to transact the buslm
the committee, and this could not be doi
legally, as the vouchers must be a
by one or more members of thai body 11
order to be accepted uy the Auditor. He
funner announced that on the Finance
Committee there were but two mej
Including Chairman Gallagher, when
there should be live. This left the latter,
committee in an equally bad fix. as three
signatures were required on all vouchers.
The further statement wan made that
every member of the board, aside from
those on the committees mentioned, had
positively refused to accept appointment
as committeeinen. Mr. Barrington con- i
teased that this left not only the board
but himself in a decidedly awkward posi
tion, and asked what was to be done.
Director Head, in very emphatic lan
guage, expressed the opinion that i
courtesy to the board Director I
should have been present and furtherm re
that, under the circumstances, Chain
Burns ought to resign his positl
committee and thus simplify matters
his colleagues.
This brought Chairman Gallagher
the Finance Committee to his feet,
the statement that It was apparent
should be a reorganization of the
mittees of the board. As there m
dently a general disinclination to
with htm :t? chairman, he would willingly
step down and out, in order tiiat the |

A MOTORMAN.
For Trying to Save His Companion's

Two boys, named Ben Snailham and
janiPS Kelliher. living at the Potrero i
were arrested last night and charged with j
malicious mischief. Shortly after S
o'clock th*y hailed a Kentucky street car.
intending to board it.
For some unknown reason the motor
man refused to stop the car, wher
the boye attempted to get aboard and
Kelliher jumped on the rear platform, and
af his companion, who had missed thÂ«
footing, was being dragged by the c*r, he
pulled the bell. The motorman at once
stopped the car and. according to the
boys he quickly released the controller
bar and going to the rear of the car,
iSkM them what they meant by p
fh.- bell Before the boys had a â 
to renly they claim, the motorman
struck Kelliher over the head with the
bar, indicting a deep wound. As the In
lured boy fell unconscious on the pUt ,
form the brutal assailant a*ain, attempted
to strike him. but was prevented by Snail
ham. Anxious to save his companion
from further injury Snailham seized him
by the leg and pulled him off the car
As he was unable to walk Snailhum laid
him down on the road-side, and as the
motorman waved the bar at him an If in
dicating thÃt he would like to use it on
him. he picked up a stone and hurled II

that the boys claimed he had assaulted
them without provocation.
THE CORONA CLUB.
New Literary Organization Formed
for Ladies Who Live in the
Mission District.
For the year past the Idea of organizing
a woman's club at the Mission was dis
cussed by prominent ladies of that locali
ty. A short time since the idea was car
ried out, and the Corona Club was insti
tuted with one hundred charter members.
The home of the new club is in the ele
gantly appointed Mission Masonic Tem
ple, on Mission near Twenty-third, and
the meetings are to be held on the second
and fourth Thursdays of each month. In
the afternoon.. The objects of the club
are literary study and mental improve
ment. A lady well known in educational
circle* has been engaged as leader, to
plan and direct the course of study.
The membership is to be limited to two
hundred. At this time there are already
one hundred and sixty nine names on the.
roll and the officers arc- hopeful that not
many days will pass before the maximum
number will be reached, and that the club
will become one of the most popular in
the city.
The officers are: President, Mrs. Frank
Dalton; first Vice-prMldent. Mrs. H. C.
Bunker; second vice-president, Mrs.
George Robertson; recording secretary,

No one objected to the proposition and
it remains now for Messrs. Gallagher and
Burns to take the Initiative in order that
the board may choose working commit
tee*. A caucus will probably be required
to settle the new division of patronage.
A row developed over the recommenda
tion of Director Ragan that the Business
Evening School be removed to the base
ment of the HumboMt School, on the
ground that the present quarters were
overcrowded. Mr. Head suggested that it
was a job to create more expense and
provide for the raising of the salary of
Drawing Teacher Roberts. Hasan hotly
resented the charge, and after some
wrangling 1 the change was ordered.
Director Barrington, as a member of
the committee appointed to investigate
the old lumber scandal, stated that the
committee had not been authorized to
employ an expert to trace the various
transactions, and consequently the report
would Show only the lumber bought, but
not Its disposition.
Mr. Head called for the reading of the
report, but was informed that the docu
ment was "locked in the secretary's
safe," and that gentleman was "away on
his Bummer vacation." Head declared
that such a report would be "no report,"
and that a complete ana true one could
be found In the archives of the last Grand
Jury. He suggested that it be procured.
An a result of this talk a resolution by
Director Derham was unanimously adopt
ed requesting the present Grand Jury "to
investigate tne alleged shortage of lumber
and fix the responsibility for such short
age, if it exists."
The resignation of Director Drucker
from the Building Committee was ac
cepted.
The board ordered the following work
done: Painting Lincoln and Webster
schools; building bulkheads, vaults :uid
fences at Irving Primary, and outside
stnirs at Buena Vista School; also by c mi â

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THUBSDAY, JULY 14, 1898.
IS A NOTABLE GYMNAST.
"Jack" Stack Returns to His Home in This Citu After
Scoring a European Success.
John T. Stack, the most finished horizontal bar performer in the world,
returned to his home in this city last night after a triumphal tour of four
years that has embraced the principal cities of Europe, Australia and
South Africa. "Jack" Stack is a product of the Olympic Club of this city,
and the members are preparing to give him a reception in keeping with the
name he has made for himself while abroad.
His brothers were clever acrobats, and when he was of suitable age he
joined the juvenile class of the club. At that time ho was a raw-boned,
awkward boy. He soon developed into a clever tumbler, and the finish to
his education in thru department was supplied when Sells Brothers' circus
wintered on this coast. The circus acrobats kept in practice at the Olympic
Club, and under their guidance the young amateur developed Into the best
loaper and forward tumbler among them. About this time a triple horizon
tal bar was added to ihe gymnasium apparatus. Under the mentorshlp of
Robert Leando Stack commenced practice. He took to the work naturally,
and the experts predicted that he would make a name for himself. He was
soon a clever performer, even excelling the professionals.
He had but little conlldence in his own ability, and it was with difficulty
that lie could be induced to accept outside engagements. With Leando as a
partner he pave an exhibition at Sacramento. Finding that he did not have
to walk h'>me from the State capital he ventured farther afield, his next trip
being t" Portland* He scored a brilliant success, and was fairly launched
on his career as a professional gymnast. He then started on the foreign
trip, which ended last night. In Australia he associated himself with Wil
ton 'who has been at the head of the acrobats for many years. Stack is the
only man wno can do the twisting somersault over the center bar of the
triple horizontal bars.
GREGGAINS TO
BOX CHOYNSKI
Heavy -Weight Califor
nians to Meet.
LATE IN AUGUST THE DATE
WESTERN BOXING CLUB SE
CURES THE BIQ MATCH.
The Men Have Never Met in the
Ring, Despite Their Prominence
and Years of Service at
the Game,
A twenty-round boxing bout between
Alexander (rreggalns and Joseph Choyn
ski has been practically arranged and
will be the next important meeting of
heavyweights in this city. Negotiations
for the match have been in progress for
some time. Greggains has been anxlou*
i for the match and Eddie Oraney, who I
: look 3 after Choynskt's Interests, has ad
1 vised him to avail of the opportunity of
j fered.
The meeting will be under the auspices
! of the recently organized Western Boxing
â¢ Club, of which Martin Murphy and
I Charles Long are the managers. This is
the first of the bouts which the match
makers of the club have in view. Wood
ward's Pavilion has been secured and all
matches will be held in its ring.
Although Grcggians and Choynski are
Californians ana have been before the
public as boxers for many years, they have
never met except in one friendly bout.
They are well matched each weighing
â¢ about one hundred and seventy-five
| pounds. This has heretofore put them at
i a disadvantage as they were called upon
to meet men much heavier than them
selves. The best of feeling has not ex
isted between them for same years. It de
veloped in ISC2 when Greggains boxed an
eighty-round draw with "Buffalo" Cos
tello before the Coney Island Club.
Choynski was in the Australians corner
and Greggalns never forgot the part he
played at that time.
Greggains has been Improving his ap
nortunities while training McConnell and
haÂ« gradually worked Into the best possi
ble condition. His last ring engagement
was with Sharkey in March, 1836. The
men fought a draw in a smaJJ ring in
the Bush Street Theater. During the
same summer Sharkey met Choynski and
Corbett. The match will be held the last
week in August. Choynski is expected
j here at once to commence training.

The Bankruptcy Act.
Many inquiries have lately been re
ceived from lawyers and parties riving in
the country by United States Attorney H.
S. Foote as to when the bankruptcy act,
approved July 1, goes into effect. In re
ply Mr. Foote says that the laA is so
framed M to go into full effect at its pas
sage, provided that no petition for vol
untary bankruptcy shall be filed within
one month and no proceedings for invol
untary bankruptcy be instituted within
four months after the passage of the act.
Proceedings commenced under the State
Insolvency laws before the passage of the
act shall not be affected by it.
Missouri Synod.
The greater part of the last day of the
pession was given to the third and fourth
thesis "On the Divinity of Christ." At
the conclusion the synod voted thanks to
Rev. J. M. Buehler of San Francisco for
the work ho had so nbly done In prepar
j ing, explaining and defending the thCMS.
| As the German Lutheran congregations of
Oakland and Los Angeles had extended
I invitations to the synod to meet there in
â  liHK.', the meeting resolved to accept the
la;t>r invitation. The synod also resolved
to publicly thank the German Lutherans
of San Francisco for their hospitality. A
; most impressive service was held at the
] conclusion of the sessions.
THE RAILROAD CASE.
Conducted in a Purer Atmosphere in
the x'arrott Building.
For the past two weeks the examination
In the case of the Southern Pacific Com
pany against the Railroad Commissioners
has dragged slowly along before Court
Commissioner Heacock In the dingy,
stuffy rooms In the Appraiser's building
until half of the learned gentlemon con
ducting the casu were In a fair way to be
laid up with the grip, paresis, or gome
other annoying complaint. A ventilated
court room could not be found and a
strike was likely to take place. Robert
K. Hayne came to the rescue and offered
the use of his sunny rooms In the Par
rott building, which offer was gladly ac
cepted. Yesterday the court convened in
its new quarters, and the cross-examina
tion of Mr. Curtis, the Southern Piucil'.c
Company's expert, was rt.*sun.^d. Thla
was conducted all of the afternoon by-
Attorney General Fitzgerald.
The examination was as to the original
cost and the cost of reproduction of all
of the railroads nf the company In Cali
fornia. It was directed to ascertain the
pernonal knowledge of Expert Curtis
of the details upon which he based the
estimate of the cost, as brought out In
his examination In chief. Mr. Fitzgerald's
apparent object was to show that Kxpert
Curtis' estimnte was not based upon his
personal knowledge of what the property
cost "r the cost of its reproduction. Tho
case will be continued to-morrow, as to
day all of the lawyers will attend the
funeral of the late Judge Oarber.

THE RULES OF AN
ORDER ARE BINDING
THEODORE GROWNEY FAILS
TO GET RELIEF.
An Old Principle Regarding Incor
porated Fraternal Organiza
tions Affirmed by Judge
Hebbard.
A decision was handed down by Judge
Hehbard yesterday In which It was held
that members of fraternal organizations
are not entitled to appeal to tho courts
from decision of the highest tribunals of
their orders regarding rules to which they
hnve voluntarily submitted, unless an
affirmative showing of fraud Is made.
The decision was rendered In the ca.Â«e of
Theodore Growney against United Lodge
A. O. U. W.
The facts which led Growney to bring
suit against the lodge axe not without In
terent. Several years ago the lodge pro
vided for and created an exempt fund, to
the benefits of which all members who
hud attained the age of 60 years were en
titled. Growney contributed to the fund
up to November. 1593, when he became GO
years of age, and then, as ho thought, be
came entitled to the benefits of the ex
empt fund. In December of the following
year, however, the lodge repealed the by
law providing for the creation of the
fund and It wits ordered distributed.
Growney appealed to the Grand and Su
preme Lodges of the order, but In each
event the caÂ«Â«e was dismissed. He then
took the matter Into the courts, but Judge
Hebbard decided that the plaintiff was
bound by the decision of his order and
was not entitled to relief In the court of
law.

MRS. JANE L.
STANFORD'S
SACRIFICE
Her Family Allowance
Is Reduced $1500.
NOW ONLY $1000 A MONTH
THE REDUCTION WAS MADE ON
HER MOTION.
It Is Her Wish to Augment the
Trust Fund Left to the
Benefit of the
University.
If charitable Inclinations and self-sac
rifice in the interests of a laudable causa
prove of. avail. Leland Stanford Jr. Uni
versity will soon reach the zenltn of its
fame, and Its rising fame will nevr pass
the zenith, but will remain to always
stand as a monument, telling what wealth
will do when coupled with ambitious pur
pose and affectionate remembmno?. For
many years, since the death of the: lato
Senator Stanford, Mrs. Stanford lias
labored hard in behalf of the now great
institution. The stories of her liberality
and sacrifice in order to more firmly build
the. foundation on which the future of ?)ie
college is builded are known in every
household, and now another story cornea
to light.
In Judge Coffey's Department of 'he
Si i eriot Court a petition was hear.l yes
terday by Judge Hunt in which M;s.
SianTird. on her own motion, asked that
the family allowance at present paid Tier
firm hei estate be reduced from $-500 a
month to $1000 a month. The mocio.'i was
read without comment and when the
reading was concluded Judge Hunt made
tl>o order. Th-" reason for the request was
not stated. It Is known, however, that
Mrs. Stanford wishes that the trust fund
set aside for the benefit of the college
should grow year by year instead of de
creasing, which might result were the in
stitution to be at the present time thrown
on its own resources. Eighteen thousand
dollars a year, the amount that will now
be added to the trust fund, will go a lons
way toward paying- the expenses of the
college, and In event the hand of mis
fortune should place an obstacle In the
path of progress now enjoyed at the in
stitution it will have an augmented fund
to depend upon in its days of hardship.
RECEPTION TO GOTHAMITES.
Volunteers to Be Royally Feasted at

Although taken by surprise at the pre

yesterday, the New York Association
hopes to retrieve Itself to-day in '
extending a fitting greeting to the men

INDIGNANT WOMEN.
Protest Against Chinese Labor on
Government Sub-Contracts.
There was a gathering of about 150
sewing women In front of Metropolitan

response to an announcement that a
meeting was to be held in the auditorium
to take steps in regard to securing Gov
ernment work which la now being done
by Chinamen.
After waiting fully an hour in expecta
tion of having the doors opened for them
an Investigation resulted In ascertaining
the fact that no one had made arrange
ments for the renting of the hall. The
women thereupon became very indignant
and denounced Labor Commissioner Fitz
gerald and also Miss Ansel, who last Sun
day had announced that a meeting would
be held "Wednesday evening in the Tem
ple. Finally, the janitor took the respon
sibility of allowing them to use the small
hall on Jessie street. Miss Ansel now ap

THE STATE'S DEMURRER
AT LAST OVERRULED
CODE COMMISSIONER'S CLAIM
AGAINST THE STATE.
Contention That Daly Could Not
Draw a Fee While Acting in
an Extra-Official Ca
pacity in Error.
By a decision rendered by Judge Heb
bard yesterday the claim of Code Com
missioner J. ('. Daly to a large remu
neration for services done the State is
apparently ell founded. The decision Is
not final, simply being a decision over
ruling a demurrer set up by the State to
the complaint tiled by Commissioner Daly,
but it g6es a long â¢way toward establish
ing- the justice of the claim made.
Some time ago Daly brought suit
against the Stat^ to recover $10, WO for le
gal services rendered. These services
were in behalf of the Railroad Commis
sion as one of the attorneys for the de
fense. In an action brought by the South
ern Pacific Company against that board
to restrain the enforcement of a schedule
of rates adopted for the transportation of
freights for all roads operated by the
Southern Pacific Company. The case was
heard m the United States Circuit Court,
and Daly was employed with the special
consent of the Attorney General of the
State. At that time he was drawing
$40i/t a year from the State as Code Com
missioner, but as he bad obtained consent
he heid that he was entitled to appear as
an attorney in the trial of the railroad
case.
When the case was decided Daly de
manded payment for the services he had
rendered, but his demand met with re
fusal. He then brought suit in the State
courts to recover the amount he thought
was due him. The State Bet up a de
murrer to the complaint, arguing that the
plaintiff had no cause of action, for the
reason that being an official fn the em
ploy of the Suite he could not legally ap
pear for the railroad company in an ex
tra-ofllcial capacity. Judge Hebbard over
ruled the demurrer, however, but granted
the State ten days within which to file its
answer.

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, July 13â The sharp break in I
j rices in Wall street was due to the reports
thai yellow fever had broken out among the
.American forces about Santiago. The propor
tions of th* break in prices is a demonstration
that there is ati enemy in Cuba which is more
ffp.r.?d than the Spanish army. There was un- |
doubtedb a peed deal of liquidation induced by
the reports, but there was also the obvious em
ir.arks at bear raid in the piling up of all sorts
of alarrr.itt rumors. Several times during: the
day the btars h tt <i misgivings about their cam
laign and !; tar tea to cover, but as often re- ,
newed â¢'. selling movement. There m an ex
tensive covering movement in the final deal
ings, however, which caused substantial rallies
Â«Ui through the stock l:Â»t and the speculative
l>or.ds as well. Net losses of between l and 2
points are nevertheless very liberally sprinkled
all through the list. There was an extensive
movement to realize also in some of the Junior
mortgage bonds, which have bees advancing
during in â¢ last few days. The reaction In these
was as sharp as in the stock list, but there was
a large absorption at the decline and an easy i
rally in most cases. The Atchlson adjust
ments, which led In point of activity, were an
exception, closing near the lowest. Business
continued very large in thÂ« Atchlson preferred
Ptock, and Its net loss is less than average.
There was no attempt apparently to support
the stock, but the pressure to realize was not
severe. Peace rumors, which carried up Span-
Is!: 4s sharply, hud no effect on Americans.
Business in bonds was large] contined to the |

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, July 13.â The Evening Post's
financial cablegram from London says: Stock
markets here were quiet to-day and the gold
withdrawals exercised a slightly drooping ef
fect on the closing price. Americans were
! prejudice! by reports of yellow fever among
, the troops in Cuba and all were lower, except
j Central Pacific and Canadian Pacific.
! Bonds are being freely deposited in connec
: tion with the reorganization of the Baltimore
' and Ohio,
â  As to a possible change in the discount rate
of the Bank of England to-morrow, all that
can be said Is that this retention of the rate
will not check the gold withdrawals, while a
reduction to 2 per cent would not facilitate
them. Owing to the great abundance of call
money the bank rate is quite inoperative.
: The bank to-day sold Â£353.000 In German coin
; for shipment to Russia through Berlin. The
continued decline In that direction would seem
to be associated with the development of
: various Industries In Russia, the capital for
' which has been largely raised In Germany.
Argentines were sensibly firmer and Chileans
showed a large rise.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, July 13.â Higher Liverpool cables
and confirmation of heavy export buslne-* ,-it
the seaboard yesterday, together with advices !
from New York that the foreign demand was ;
1 still unsatisfied, started wheat strong. Fine
weather and the more favorable crop news
developed generous Belling by scalpers partly
for the short account and partly to secure
profits from investments made on the recent
break. The market â¢ did not get support
enough to sustain prices in the face of this
Belling and September .vent off to 67% c. July
lost lc, declining to 74\c. A break of 5c a
bushel In cash wheat at St. Louis and indica
tions that by this day week new wheat would
: be moving too freely for the demand caused
great weakness in the end and prices declined
Hill further. Chicago received forty cars of
wheat, thirty-seven being new. Atlantic port
I clearances of wheat and flour were equal to i
I 146,000 bushels. July lett off lo lower and Sep- |
tember lOst *iC.
.' The weather was fine for corn and crop
prospects Improved, but the comparatively loiv
price at the start encouraged bulls to buy
liberally in wheat and prices were mostly ad
vanced. The market turned decidedly weak
' during the latter part of the session, bulls un- !
loading their holdings and the early advance- |
! was more than lost. September declined Vie
; for the day.
Heavy selling by professionals during the last
halt hour, favorable crop reports and the
weakness in corn caused a downfall in oats.
September lost He.
| Falling off in the receipts and higher prices

edge was taken off the market by considerable

BOSTON WOOL MARKET.
BOSTON, July 13.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow of the
Wool market: The market has net been so
devoid of Interest this week as during some
previous weeks, though the situation is by no
means a lively one. A leading feature^ Is the
practical consummation of a sale of 700,00)
pounds of South American cross-breds, for
which the parties here have been negotiating
for some time. There have been some good
sized sales of Australian, one party negotiating
the sale of 600,000 pounds, more or less, and
another one 160.000 pounds. There has been
a rather good Inquiry for medium Territory
Wools. There have also been quite a number
of sales of medium fleece Wools, the total
reaching: 315,000 pounds. Quotations, of course,
are occasionally shaded, but as a rule there Is
that same complacency on the part of holders
of Wool regarding the future that has been
so pronounced a feature for the last eighteen
months.
The rales of the week in Boston amount to
6J6.000 pounds domestic and 504,000 pounds for
eign, making a total of LSS6.OOO, against a total i
of 1,975,000 pounds for the previous week and |
j a total of 8,942,000 pounds for the corresponding
week last year.
Sal's since January 1. IS9*. amount. to 69,464,
310 pciur.ilÃ, against 150, 441, 600 pounds last year
at this time.

IS DODBTFUL
OF ALAMEDA
Bitter Factionalism Has
Aroused the State.
THE WATER FRONT BUGABOO
DAVIS CHARGED WITH BEING
SOMEWHAT DILATORY.
Although of Great Import to Oakland
the Suit has Been Hung Up
for Nearly a
Year.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
;â¢ S Bi !<,:t;\\.i.y. July 13
Politicians from this county who have
recent!;. I â¢ - the pulse of the i
State regarding the Republican nomina- j
tion for Governor are greatly disappointed
and somewhat disconcerted. They have |
'-rod that In many of th< I
counties the !>itu-r feeling existing i:. A i
tneda is being referred to as a reason why
It would be bad polio;.- and worse politics
to place either of the local men at the j
head of the ticket.
It has always been Alameda's boast
since the McKlnley campaign that her
vote turned the tide in California, and this
very argument is now I â¢ â  j.unst
this county. At the last State election
Governor Budd only succee iiting
Mr. Estee by a majority i
than half that which McKinley obtained
over \V. J. Bryan. Should this balance of
political parties still exist it will require
the strongest possible Republican vote in
this county to Insure the election of the
Republican Governor. There is no doubt
whatever that it is impossible to har
monize the party oiu r ol :ue existing
candidates.
Unfortunate as it may be, and humiliat
tag as it undoubtedly is, it cannot be de
nied that Alameda County Is known for
the sharp] of its political "knives"
"when factionalism is bitter. This ha- fre
quently been demonstrated. Six years ago :
pave Martin, the Republican candidate
for Sheriff, was the leader of one Repub- <
lican faction, which felt bo bitter toward |
the other faction that he was knifed most !
mercilessly at the polls and a Democrat i
was elected. Four years ago at the last :
county election, Louis Schafer received
the Republican nomination for Sheriff and
was so severely knifed by factional poli
ticians that he was easily beaten by a
Populist. These facts are now being
nurieu at Alamedans who go through the
P^dee reSPeCliVe * UeÃSlhs of,
It is freely predicted that if either man
lr receive th nomination the .factional
'?* I Is so . bitter that the nominee
would not be able to carry his own
iXu y Â£nd as the fate " the State is
hkelj to hinge on Alameda's vote, the ob
isfimpo'nlnc^ inVeSted with the great-
a well-known Oakland politician who
has just returned from a tour embracing
many parts of the State said to-day .hat
the opinion held by politicians outside of '
t'u? v Co .V T n / y iR lar P cI >- shared by many I
within it. "If either Pardee or Davis re- I
ceive the nomination, " he said, "we shall !
witness just Bach another disgraceful
spectacle as we have witnessed at the
last two count - v elections. It is impossible
to believe .that either man will receive
the suport of the opposite faction. And
unless Alameda puts forward a third man
with sufficient influence to harmonize the
two factions, the nomination for Governor
will most certainly go outside of this
county.
The fate of all Alameda County's can
didates, whether State. Congressional or
for county offices, is inseparably connect
ed with the water front or the harbor
or twenty years every commercial body
and every merchant of this city has been
attempting to have the water-front ques
tion settled and the harbor improved.
Everybody knows that the future of Oak
an( depends on the development of the
harbor, yet there has no- been any appa
rent attempt made to fix the responsi
bility for the interminable delays Dr
Pardee attained considerable water-front
notoriety some Iyears1 years ago in conjunction
Wl^\! :>lCk Snell. a railroad Councilman
and his political following has ever since
attempted tO i mak - e consl^^able capital
uuftnMH 1 kÂ°* i, cam PalÂ»n. although
It left nothing but history. VV R Davis
was tatrusted with the carrying on of the
litigation and for a time pushed matters
with much energy. He and his colleagues
have received the full amount of their
generous contract made with the city and
for nearly a year the water front' hiÂ«
been abandoned to its fate
Mr. a Davis' political opponents declare
that as the Supreme Court's celebrated
decision was rendered on September 13
of last year, and ordered the case re
tried along certain well-defined line's it
is about time something was done in the
matter. At present the case stands con- '
tinued till August. As the result of â¢â '. I
litigation according to the Supreme :
Court's instructions will be the loss of th*
water front to Oakland, neither Pardee '
nor Davis' followers are anxious to say
anything about it at this time '
County Assessor Dalton made political
capital three years ago by taking the !
property off the assessment roll and now
he is patching his campaign fences by i
putting it back again. The Supervisor
have also intimated that they will do '
some polltlces by exposing Mr. Daltons i
delinquency and ordering him to put it i
on the roll for last year, so that at least i
one of the three years' lost taxes may be !
recovered. Congressman Hilborn has no <
particular love for the water front be
cause it has made him more political
enemies than friends. He was so be-
Bought by Alameda delegations and Oak- :
land merchants to sign various petitions
to the War Department concerning the
tidal canal that in the end it was found
he had signed nearly every petition and :
made enemies on both sides of the estu- i
ary. Although the water front and the
harbor are of the utmost importance in
any consideration of the future of Oak- j
Jand those who are most profuse In their !
professions of loyalty to this city at this
time would most gladly avoid any refer
once to them were they permitted to do
so.

There are some little bills amounting to about

It in an utter Impossibility to reduce to a j
! financial basis the immense quantities of pro
visions placed at our disposal by the great
generosity of, the people of Alameda County.
1 There have been sent to us tons of sandwiches,
tons of fruit and eggs by the hundreds of
dozens, for our good people have In reality fed
! an army.
We realized quite early that we had to deal
with very hungry men, with soldiers, who
had not had fresh meat for days. So our main
Item of expense soon became a" hot stew which
was most keenly enjoyed by the tired, hungry
j men. Five sheep were required each day to
make the stew. The ladies of the emergency
' committee were often on duty from the first
boat In the morning till the last boat at night.
I In the nine weeks which closed last Satur
day, the emergency committee fed each day. on
an average, about 250 soldiers. The work was
done entirely In the true spirit of the Red
Crossâ a sincere desire to help the country by
ministering to its soldiers. While this Is true.
It has. at the same lime, been a source of
: great advertisement for the entire State of
California.
The necessity for their work at the ferry
being apparently over, the ladles gave up that
part of it last Saturday evening. Late In the
j afternoon, however, a telegram was received
j by the chairman announcing the arrival of COO
Pennsylvania recruits, who would remain at
the pier all night, and would have neither
supper nor breakfast, unless the emergency
committee could attend to them. Th-; chair
i man pave orders that they were to be fed at
the restaurant at the pier, and when they ar-
J rived at midnight a hot supper was served to
i them.
The work has brought out a rare response
from the entire communityâ from the little
â â¢ Winn, who brought In the "nickel he
hud saved up for the soldiers." to the $100 d >-
nation of prosperous citizens. Most all of
the success of the work has been due to tic
n ble efforts of the women of our -ounty
They ha\e been faithful and untiring in th.'lr
work on the committees. The women of Oak
land have been nobly generous In hading food
â  te table, thus making it possible for ita
chairman to cordially welcome the hungry,
tired boys in blue.
WHY GEORGE W. BAKER
RESIGNED HIS OFFICE
LOS ANGELES TOO FAR AWAY
FOR HEADQUARTERS.
He Does Not Approve of the Course
Pursued by the Populists in
Nominating a Governor.
OAKLAND. July 13.â George W. Baker,
who resigned as chairman of the State
Silv-r Republican Committee at Sacra
mento yesterday afternoon, returned home
last night, but went back to the scene of
strife at the capital this afternoon.
"My reasons for resigning from the
chairmanship of the Silver Republican
Committee are fully set forth in my letter
to the committee," said Attorney Baker
to-day. "The committee's headquarters
are in Los Angeles, and in order to attend
| to the duties of chairman it requires fre
: quent visits to that city, which my busi
ness engagements will not permit, and
hence, in order to advance the interests
and labors of the committee, I considered
it advisable that a chairman should be
i elected who was on the ground and who
would give the matter his persona] atten
1 tion during the campaign.
"There were some differences of opinion
as to the proper course for the committee
to pursue, but these were mere matters of
detail, and did not enter into consideration
when the resignation was made. The
members of the committee from Los An
geies were in favor of joining the Pop
ulists in the nomination of a Democratic
candidate at Sacramento in advance of his
nomination by his own party, and I do
not consider such a course as conducive
to the best interests of the reform forces.
I am of the opinion that the Populists
should nominate a ticket of their own and
appoint a fusion committee to confer
with the Democrats, and if the latter were
in a mind to join forces with the Populists
and Silver Republicans upon a platform
mutually satisfactory, then I am willing
to submit any candidate whom the joint
committee might agree upon; but 1 do not
b< lieve in anticipating the action of the
Democratic party by naming any candi
date from among their aspirants In ad
vance of his being named by his own
party.
"This view was not shared by the ma
: jority of the Silver Republican Committee, ;
who believed that the naming of a Demo- |
crat by the Populist convention would
operate ;u> a string, incentive for the
Democratic convention to name the same
candidate. However, these are simply dif
ferences of opinion, which always occur
in conventions, and which must always
be settled by mutual concessions, and did
not in any way precipitate my resigna
tion.
"I did not consider then, and do nnt
now, that the Democratic party desired
the Populists to lead off in nominating ;i
candidate for them, and in this view I am
i ted by the artion of their State
Central Committee yesterday after my |
resignation was made and accepted.
"While they expressed, with some dls- ;
sentlents, a willingness to fuse with the
Populists upon certain conditions, they
were unanimous in the opinion that the
; Populists should not be permitted to name
in advance their candidate for Governor
or any other office. This, in my judgment,
is the only sensible view to take of the
matter, and was the only matter upon
which I dissented from the views of the
other members of the Silver Republican
<'i mmittee. I am now and have ever been
and will always remain an uncompromis
ing advocate of the principles of bimetal
lism and in favor of any honorable means
to promote Its success, and to that end
will use my best exertions in support of
men and measures to accomplish that
result."
An Objectionable Ordinance.
Â«UMEDA. July 13.â The new wagon
ordinance went into effect to-day, and its
enforcement by the police raised a storm
of protests from those affected. I'nder
itn terms express wagons are not allowed
to stand on street corners waiting fur
customers, but must keep on the move.
On the other hand, store dealers' wagons
may stand in front of such establish
ments, and so may the vehicles used by
real estate dealers. This, the expressmen
:...iik. is an unjust discrimination. Con
ntly they have combined, will retain
counsel and will fight the ordinance on
the ground of special legislation.
Red Cross Work.
AL..MEDA. July 13.â Mrs. M. F. Mc-
Gum, treasurer "f the Alameda branch
of the Red Cross Society, has made a re
port of the work done so far by the or
ganization. The total amount of money
collected to date is J1409 17. Of this
$5. r ,K 07 has been expended in various ways
for the benefits of the troops, leaving
tsCl 30 on hand. The expenses cover a
wide rang-, from flannel bandages to meals
and lodgings for members of the local
'â¢ompany who came from other towns
and had to be provided for.
Mess Tent for Company G.
AUMEDA, July 13.â One of the few
companies at Camp Barrett which has
be< i. without a mess tent up to to-day Is
Company <;. This was remedied to-day,
when a committee of ladies from the Red
< ross went out to camp and presented
th<- boys with a fine tent, capable of
seating* eigtity-l.ve men. After the pres
< minion the men were treated to ice
fTf-am, cnk<? and coffee by a committee of
ladles outside the Ked Cross. At the con
clusion a few speeches -were made, and
the boys gave three cheers for their
friends.
City Trustees and tne Bridge Matter.
â¢ ALAMEDA, July 13.â The City Trustees
will hold a special meeting this evening
for the purpose of discussing the matter
of using the Alice-street bridge while the
Webster-atreet structure is being rebuilt.
The Bentiment here is practically unani
mous In favor of such use, and delegates
will be appointed by the Trustees to confer
with Oakland representative* with the
view of having th* 5 bridge: so used. It Is
estimated that it can be put In shape for
so i-aat It can be used by teams for
several months.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
90S Broadway, July 13.
The Board of Supervisors sitting as a
Board of Equalization took occasion this
morning to correct an Impression created
in an evening paper last night, which was
evidently Intended to bolster up the af
fairs of the County Assessor. W. G.
Hawkett was busy yesterday taking off
descriptions of the water front property
from the assessment roll.
The purpose was to ascertain just how
much property of the water front com
pany has escaped assessment for the -past
three years that is on the roll at this
time. The Call, this morning, stated the
facts in connection with the case, which
are that the Supervisors wish to recover
for the county as much of the lost taxes
as possible.
Supervisor Talcott stated the situation
this morning as follows: "I desire to say
at this time that it was under my per
sonal order, as chairman of this board,
that Mr. Hawkett was taking off the
rolls the description of the water from
rty. When it was announced that
(600,000 worth of property had been put on
the rolls that has been left off for the
previous three years I was anxious to see
where It was located- I believed it was
my duty to do so. If, heretofore, any
property has been left off the assessment,
we are entitled to know it and I think
the county Is entitled to the benefit. That
Is my reason for wanting those descrip
tions. If the board has any objection I
would like to hear it."
Supervisor Roeth said that he was sor
ry the matter had been misrepresented,
as the Supervisors had only acted with
in their rights. He thought it could go
on rf-cord that the action of the Supervis
ors was indorsed by the Board of Equal
ization. Supervisor Church said he had
occasion to look into the assessment
of some of the law libraries of this
city and he had found some strange fig
ures. The library of Messrs. Davis &
Hill is assessed at $300, and he had asked
Mr. Hawkett to look up the assessment
of other law libraries.
These incidents show very plainly that
there is to be a bitter fight over the as
sessment rolls. It is self-evident that the
Assessor in compiling them did not for
get that there is an election this fall and
the Supervisors are evidently aware of
the same fact. As Mr. Talcott, one of
the retiring Supervisors, has made a
splendid record in his district during his
term of office, and as Mr. Church, the
other retiring Supervisor, !s a prominent
political leader in Mr. Pardee's ward, the
situation is decidedly interesting.

when he refused to receive a report from
the grand jury unless all the members
wer e present. Sixteen of the nineteeji :
members appeared In his court and were
prepared to present a report. The court
declaied that it could not deal with a por
tion of the grand iury, especially In ac
cepting a report which might contain an
indictment, and stated thut when the
grand lury was ready In a complete body
It would receive the report. One, of the
grand jurors is away on a business tour
and cannot reach Oakland before August
22, by which time another grand jury
should be at work. It is supposed the re- j
port contains another indictment arising
out of the overcharges of constables.

Bridge Removed.
WOULD PE BUT TEMPORARY
BOARD OF HEALTH DECLARES
A ROAD A NECESSITY.
Without Alice Street Bridge Oakland
and Alameda Could No'; Keep
Up Their Business
Relations. j
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 13.
The fear of Alameda that it will be cut
off from communication with Oakland un
j til the new Webster street bridge â¢ be
i built is being shared by people on this
I side of the estuary. A special meeting
| of the Board of Trade was held this morn
â  ing to consider the matter. A resolution
was adopted urging the Supervisors to ac
! cept the offer of the Southern Pacific
Company to use Alice street bridge as a
j public thoroughfare after the railroad has
transferred its tracks to its new Harrison
street bridge.
Director James P. Taylor stated that if
Alice street bridge be not made available
j for teams it " would be a serious incon
venience for people In both cities to have
to drive around by way of Park street.
All business between Oakland and Ala
meda would be handicapped. And as the
â  work of construction on the new Webster
i street bridge will probably ' occupy six
I months, Mr. Taylor argued that the ques
tion is a very serious one. He believed
the Supervisors should accept the rail
â  road's offer and should put the Alice
| street bridge in condition for use. He
stated that by actual count between 300
and 450 teams crossed Webster street
i bridge daily besides many other vehicles
j and hundreds of pedestrians and cyclists.
Edson Adams objected strongly to being
fenced in. He said the bridge at Alice
street should be removed at once, as it
i would block the harbor and interfere
with shipping. It would add to the long
line of obstructions and spoil 730 feet in
! the middle of the estuary for shipping
i purposes. If the city expended an amount
of money on the improvement of the Alice
i street bridge, the Government would prob
; ably order the structure moved. With the
' removal of the bridge a wharf could "Be
built of which the harbor stands badly in
need. Mr. Adams said if the city was
going to expend money on the construe
: tion of a thoroughfare it should be in a
permanent place. All damage to naviga
: tion Is a hindrance to the development of
j the city. The building of so many bridges j
I in the estuary was practically putting a ]
, fence around shipping interests and the
i tax-payers should put a stop to it.

OAKLAND, July lo.â Mortimer Mc

i ing expedition, came home to-day, badly

FOUR HEATS
AT OAKLAND
First Protracted Race
Had to Date.
TWO CERTAINTIES OVERTURN
MELOAB WINS A GRAND RACE
IN FINE STYLE.
Resort, Our Jack and Old Plunkett
All Prove Good Winners in
Other Bvents â The
Results.
The fifteenth day's races at the Breed
ers' meeting at Oakland yesterday were
in the main exciting and marked by a
four-heat raceâ the 2:17 trotâ opening the
card.
It was a two in three affair, with the
fast mare Silver Ring, uur Jack, Our
Lucky, Mabel McKinney and Little Miss
as starters, Lon declining battle. Our
Lucky came here with stories of a trial
in 2:12, and opened even money favorite
in conjunction with Our Jack. The field
sold at 6 to Lucky 5. The first heat, in
2:l6Vs, looked so easy to the little stallion
it was 1 to 3 on him for the second heat.
Our Jack laid the first heat up, having
made a sprawling break going away.
Little Miss was distanced.
I Our Lucky and Silver Ring fought out
â¢ the second heat, but near the wire Lucky
broke, and running out In the lead fin
ished ahead of Silver Ring. The judges
! properly set him back and gave Wil
; Hams' big mare the heat. Had Hackney
; sat still behind Our Lucky he would cer
! tainiy have won heat and race, but he
j went to the bat when it looked danger
' ous, and this foolishness cost the race.
i Our Jack now came to the front, and as
; Silver King is none too game, won out.
, Our Lucky and Mabel McKinney being
I distanced in the third heat, it was all
, over, for Jack won It in 2:2OVi easily. The
j betting throughout was favorable to those
taking the auctionsâ iielders against Our
j Lucky.
The special for named pacers went to
the veteran Plunkett in 2:18%. Hijo del
; Diablo, none too game, stopped badly,
and the old brown pacer in Mizner's sta
: ble got the money. He was at even
money. F. W. and Delphi likewise posted
| with HIJo at 4 to 5. The secoring was de
1 cidedly tiresome. The field sold at 5 to
| a like price for the favorite and Andy
I Welch's old motto, "always play the
field in a pacing race," looked to be com
| nion-senso logic once again.
In the green pacing class the talent fell
! heavily again, as Lolita, easily winner
on Monday over Resort, whs unsteady,
and distanced in the opening heat, she
being at even money and having quite a
I play in the auctions at 5 to 6 for the lot.
! Resort won easily in 2:l7Vi. nothing able
to make him stop sufficiently to lose,
although he was backing up decidedly
each trip. Durfee's little mare. Lady
Margaret, was second and Harry Ra
mon third. Owens was asked to let Dick
Havey ride the last heat behind Harry
Ramon, but the suspect was too unsteady
to avail, and so it goes. Undoubtedly he
1 has been monkeyed with heretofore and
' been racing under cover.
"Billy" Johnson won with the big chest
j nut horse Melvar in the fourth race, and
i all were pleased at the result. The sable
| hued gentleman simply toyed with the
I field 'and landed the money in 2:25Vs over
j Winella. Piletta Hunger was 3 5 fa
vorite, the winner's price even money.
Wlnelia's quarter boot broke at the word
and she finished with a knee boot flap
ping.
To-day's events should be the very best
to date, and the free for all trot especial
ly promises excellent sport with the con
testants ail at their best just at present.
It is good betting the Oakland track gets
a new trotting record ere the winner is
decided.

BANNERS FOR THE
HAWAIIAN ISLANDS
ANNEXATION FLAG WAS USED
ONCE BEFORE THERE.
Beautiful Gift From the San Fran
cisco Chamber of Commerce to
a Similar Body in
Honolulu.
Within a short time the Hawaiian Is
! lands will be flooded with the Stars and
i Stripes, many people of this city, and,
I In fact, of every city of the Union, wish
ing to have a gift of their own floated
{o the gentle breezes of the Pacific upon
the occasion of the flag-raising attending
the annexation. There is no doubt that
j hundreds of commercial bodies and pri
vate citizens would gladly provide the
emblem of liberty if for a moment they
thought it would be the first to be hoisted
over the islands. The present officials at
the Islands have some little choice in the
matter themselves and In all probability
the first flag that will be unfurled will
' be one that has been over the capital of
I the islands before.
When the revolution that placed Hawaii
' among the republics of the earth took
I place, and the native queen and her fol
lowers were removed as ruling powers,
the marines from the United States
cruiser Boston who went ashore to pro
tect the interests of the Americans car
ried a large flag that was hoisted over
the palace of the deposed queen. In time
that flag came down, but it was not de
stroyed or lost. It was saved for an oc
casion which the then revolutionists had in
! their minds. The occasion has arrived or
! will soon arrive, and the flag will be aeain
I unfurled to the wind at the celebration
| and annexation. The Hawaiians who left
for the islands last evening on the Ala
meua made this announcement to their
friends just before the vessel sailed.
When ex-Minister Thurston and Min
ister Hatch of Hawaii took their de
parture for the islands they carried with
them another banner, a gift from the
local Chamber of Commerce to the Cham
ber of Commerce of Honolulu. Accom
panying it was a letter which explains
the purpose of the gift.
SAN FRANCISCO, July 13, 1898.
The Chamber of Commerce of Honolulu,
Honolulu, Hawaiian Islandsâ Dear Sirs: It
affords us great pleasure to have the oppor
tunity of presenting to you, in compliance with
a resolution adopted by the Board of Trustees
July 12, the accompanying flag of the United
j States, for the raising of which on the Ha

! ently labored.
Consul General Charles T. Wilder kindly for
wards the flag on the steamer Alameda to-day.
We know you will unfold It to the island
i breeze with pride and honor as an emblem of
civilization, humanity and progress, and that
henceforth we will not only work with you for
i the furtherance of our mutual commercial re
i latlons, but will stand together under one flag.
; With assurance of our kindest regards, we are
i yours faithfully,
THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF SAN

Reception to Commissioners.
Several days ago the trustees of the
Chamber of Commerce sent to Senator
Cullom at Washington, one of the Ha
waiian Commissioners, an invitation to ac
cept the hospitality of the Chamber when
he and his fellow commissioners reached
this city on their way to the islands. It
Is the intention to give the commissioners
a public reception. Yesterday President
Hugh Craig received the annexed answer:
Hon. Hugh Craig. President Chamber of
Commerce, Pan Francisco: Thanks for invita
tion to myself and other members Hawaiian
Commission. Are awaiting: information regard
ing steamer accommodations, San Francisco to
Hawaii. Hope to sail about August 1.

PEDDLERS
DECLARED
NUISANCES
Dr. de la Matyr Wants
None of Them.
HIS PROTESTS WERE IN VAIN
WM . ROSENBERG. THE MOST
PERSISTENT, ARRESTED.
It Will Result in the Validity of the
"No Peddlers" Sipn Ordinance
Being Tested in the
Courts.
Dr. Ellas B. de la Matyr. 65S Geary
street, who has been a martyr to ped
dlers ringing his door bell at all hours
of the day. has now risen In his might
and right to smite them with the strong
arm of the law.
The doctor has a stern, "No poddlers."
on his front door in a conspicuous place,
and it !.-- Impossible for any one not to
observe it, as the door is only about three
feet from the sidewalk. By the ordi
nance passed by the Board of Supervis
ors in Juiy, is%. it is made a misdemeanor
for a peddler to ring a door bell of a
house whereon such a sign is placed, and
solicit purchases for his wares, the pen
alty being a tine not exceeding $100 or six
months' imprisonment, or both.
ai me time the ordinance was paf^ed
the Peddlers' Association protested vig
orously against it, but it still remains in
force. One- or two arrests were made im
mediately after the passing of the ordi
nance, but only nominal lines were In
flicted.
Dr. de !a Matyr has been remonstrat
ing mildly for months with peddlers
ngaJnst ringing his door bell, and all
Stopped t!if annoyance except William
Rosenberg, a fruit peddler. Rosenberg
continued to ring the uoor bell, till a few
days ago the doctor lost patience with
him and warned turn that if he. did not
desist he would have him arrested. Rosen
berg, according to the doctor, was very
insolent, and retorted that he did not
care a river obstruction for the law, and
â¢would ring n.e door bell as often as he
pleased.
"Suppose," said Rosenberg, "all the
houses In the city had these si^ns on
themâ where W"Uid we be. 1 We have an
association and are able to fight the ordi
nance."
The doctor wrote a letter to Chief Lees
complaining of the nuisance, and the
chief sent it to Captain Wittman, who last
Monday detailed Policeman Attrldge in
clothes to k>--i> .1 look-out for Rosen
berg:.
Yesterday Rosenberg drove his wagon to
th>"> corner of Leavenworth and Geary
Streets and 5-ent a man named Qinnls di
rect to the doctor's door. Qinnls had a
few pears In his hand and when the doc
tor answered the bell he asked him if he
wanted to buy some. The doctor asked
him who had sent him, and (frinnis pointed
To thy wagon at the corner, seated on
â which was Rosenberg. Policeman Attridge
made his appearance and the doctor,
pointing to Rosenberg, informed him he
was the mat he was after.
Attridge plit'vM Rosenberg under arrest
and booked him a' the city prison for
violating the ordinance. He gave $10 ball
and was released. H< declared thai he
â would lay the matter before the Peddlers'
Association at once and get them to light
the validity of thf ordinance. He did not
care for any signs. He had paid his
license and could, in his opinion, ring
any door bell.
Dr. de ia Matyr is determined to push
the case. "This fellow ha-s given me no
end of annoyance," said he, in speaking
of the arrest, "and when .spoken to, waa
very saucy and impudent. I asked him
for his number, thinking that would have
(Tect of keening him away, but it
was ui-eli-pp. The last time I Fpoke to him
it tw k me all my time to control my tem
per. I want to see if tills law Is to be
enforced. The s.^n on my door means
what it says. Why. this morning eleven
peddlers came to the house, and it is my
firm belief that the man arrested sent
them all."

York She Cut the Top of
Her Thumb Off.
The new union ferry depot was formally
opened to tho traveling public yesterday.
The first steamer to enter the slips was
the Hay City from Oakland and Alameda
on the narrow gauge route. Her passen
gers were landed In th* new structure, but
the passengers on the Piedmont, which
arrived three minutes after the Bay City,
were the first to use the grand nave of
the- structure. As soon as the Piedmont
was made fast. Chief Engineer Howard
Holmes of the Harbor Commission low
ered the apron himself and in a few sec
onds the people on the ferry-boat wero
thronging Into the grand nave. Every
body was delighted with the arrange
ments and nothing but words in praise of
the flno structure were heard on all sides.
Among those present at the opening
were Harbor Commissioners Colnon, Har
ney and Herold, General Manager Fill
more of the Southern Pacific and Howard
Holmes, who supervised the construction
of the depot.
Early In the morning the railroad peo
ple began moving. It took until noon to
get all Its papers and effects Into the neTv
offices and the work of selling tickets In
the new depot began at once. A number
of old fences were torn down during the
afternoon and their removal added great
ly to the appearance of the new building.
In thirty days it Is hoped that the entire
structure will have been made ready for
its prospective tenants and the old post
office ajid depot structures removed. Then
the new depot will shine forth in all its
glory.

about an Inch off the cud of her left
thumb. Ht lady friends removed her to
the Harbor Receiving Hospital, where Dr.
Deas attended to the wound. Miss Cook
suffered a great deal from the shock and
also while the wound was being dressed,
but she bore It all wonderfully well and
laughed and joked with hor friends while
waiting for a earring" to take h<Â»r home.
The Rrltlsh ship Linlithgowshire had a
very hard time on her way from Oregon
t<> Europe with a cargo of grain. She
was caught in a storm which carried

John Oppenheim. a well-known clothier,
is back on the water front. Every
Beater and whaler on the coast knows
Oppenheim nnd when those Industries
died away his business went with th*>m
He accordingly sold out and went to
C.rnir.g, where he opened a general mer
chandise store. During the big fire in
that town on the Rth inst. he was burnt
out and nearly lost his life. John is an
old sailor and that fact stood him In
good stead. The hotel In which hÂ« was
living was one of the^ first buildings to
go. When Oppenheim awoke all the reg
ular means of escape were cut off, so he
had to take to the water pipe, which ran
from the roof to the ground, and by tha
means Bayed his life. He then .stood am
watched his st">re. catch fire and go up In
smoke, after which he borrowed a sul
of clothes from a friend and came back
to San Francisco.
As far a. j the accommodations for the
soldiers arc concerned the steamer. City
â >f Pnebla can give all the other trans
ports cards and spad<'Â« and then beat
them easily. Goodall. Perklr.s & Co, have.
Fpared nothing In order to make her
â¢ quipments perfect and in consequence
she i? a model troopship. She is fitted
throughout with the Turner patent bunks
ar-d all the Quarters are light and airy-
Sixteen additional shower baths, making
forty In all. have been put In, and the
upper deck Is being covered with an awn
ing, so that the soldiers can sleep up
there in the tropics If they want to. Cap
tain Bennett of the PaHn> Coast Stram-
Bhlp Company, who superintended the
fitting out of' the Pnebla, deserves great
credit for the manner in which the work
has been done.
The Pacific Mail Steamship Company
has also adopted tho Turner patent bunk.
The Peru h.'is been fitted out with th^m
and they are to be put In the Rio de
Janeiro. Mr. Turner, who invented the
bunk. Is port steward of the Pacific Coast

TAX ON MINING STOCKS.
Secretary Gage Asked as to the
Meaning of the New Ruling.
The ruling of the Commissioner of In
ternal Revenue at Washington that a $1
stock was taxable at the same rate as
another of 5100 p:ir value has caused con-
Bternation on the Stock P^xchange. A dis
patch was sent to Secretary Gage yester
day asking him what the tax would be on
a certificate of stock of the par value of
J! p>r share, and his answer is anxiously
awaited.
If the ruling of the Commissioner is sus
tained some new means of relief from
â¢what is considered an unusually harsh
and unjust ruling will have to be sug
gested. Meantime it has caused a halt
In the work of the attorneys who were
arranging for the reincorporatinn of the
mining companies with capital stocks of
the par value of from $1 to $5 per share.
A Notary Saved Her.
The charge <>f perjury preferred by At
torney Francoour of Oakland against
>trs. Gertrude K. Jones was dismissed by
Judge Mogan yesterday. The alleged per
jury was contained in an affidavit by Mrs.
Jones in a suit brought against her and
her husband by Francoeur. W. T. Hess,
notary public, testified that Mrs. Jones
did not personally appear before him and
swear to the affidavit, but it was brought
to him by Edwin M. Hunter, clerk for
Attorney Hutchinson, with Mrs. Jones'
signature attached to it. This testimony
â was corroborated by Hunter.

; UNDER STATE GOVERNMENT
iE. D. ADAMS EXPLAINS THE
PURPOSE OF THE MARKET.
i The Commission Merchants Are Op
posed to the Producer Selling
Direct to the Con
sumer.
Resolved. That It Is the sense of this board
that Jackson, Washington and Clay street
wharves shall be used for a free market, and
I that this board will so use such wharves for
such purposes and begin the operation of said
free market as soon as rules and regulations
for the government of the cam* can be formu
lated and the proper officers selected.
The above decision, reached yesterday
afternoon by the Harbor Commissioners
relative to the institution of a free public
market on the water front for perishable
goods, marks the close of the months of
constant wrangling between the producers
and the Harbor Commissioners, who have
been in constant battle ever since the
bill providing for the establishment of
the market was passed by the last leg
islature.
Edward F. Adams, the representative
of the producers' interests, began as
usual yesterday by demanding the -earth,
then the entire city front, finally compro
mising with Clay, Washington and Jark
son street wharves as a just appropria
tion of public property for the needs and
demands of the new market.
The main object of the market, as set
forth and demonstrated by Adams, is to
facilitate the disposal and purchase of
vegetables and other perishable products
in the interests of both the producer and
the consumer. The Harbor Commission
will operate and control the market by
the appointment of a superintendent and
the adoption of all necessary regulations
that will be a benefit to the State and the
various interests which it will represent.
With the establishment of the market
have come the protests and objections of
the "middlemen" (commission mer
chants), who will be practically driven
from their heretofore lucrative traffic of
selling the goods of the producer to the
consumer, as under the new system goods
will be sold by public sale direct from the
producer to the consumer.
Adams supplemented the request of the
producers in the establishment of the
market by asking that the proper rail
road facilities be provided by the Board
of Harbor Commissioners for the proper
disposal of their products. The demand
was opposed, however, by Major Harney
who maintained that before railroad
transportation could be considered it was
advisable to first test the proposition of
experimenting with the transportation
facilities afforded by the boats now hand
ling nearly the entire perishable products
of the farmers.
Under the regulations, that will b.e dic
tated by the discretion of the Harbor
Commissioners, every trafficker and

dealer in products that nre shipped to the
new market and Ptoml on State property,
pending their disposal, will be under State
regulations and the immediate jurisdic
tion of the Commission. Licenses In form
of permits will be awarded and the trade
guided in this way. Before goods can be
sold the State regulations must be prop
erly signed by the dealers and the stipula
tions set forth duly conformed with.
Harbor Commissioner Colnon maintain
ed that if the proposed market were run
on the basis outlined by Adams, the new
system would he identical with the pres
ent and there would be absolutely noth
ing gained by its formal Institution. He
claimed that the object was to facilitate
the sellers' and the buyers' interests and
if this object could not be obtained with
out legislating in favor of the commission
merchant the market failed in the purpose
for which it is organized.
"If this market Is not to be In the inter
ests of .the seller and the buyer," said
Conlon, "what in the is it for?
The 'subject of holding public auction
sales for the disposal of the products was
objected to by the commission merchants
on the ground that the producer would
be about the only one to derive any bene
fit from it.
Major Harney contended that If a public
auction were held early in the. morning,
as It would undoubtedly be, at a time
when the consumer could not be present,
the commission merchants and the ped
dlers could form a combination and dic
tate the prices at which the goods should
be sold.
In order to prevent the new market
from being overstocked Adams advised
that the superintendant in charge be In
structed to forward a report dally as to
the condition and the amount of merchan
dise on hand to the producer, thereby reg
ulating the exact amount of goods to be
disposed of.
Among those opposed to the public auc
tion scheme was Attorney Matson, who
claimed, as a producer, that the board
had absolutely no rigl)t to dictate to the
farmers where and how they should sell
their goods, further contending that they
had no jurisdiction over the collection of
an additional toll for goods landed in the
free market. Colnon. however, argued
that the law as adopted makes no men
tion where a man may sell his goods and
that all producers could dispose of their
goods where they pleased.
Commissioner Herold was opposed to
granting the entire water front for the
use of the market and thought that it
should be confined on one wharf until
necessity demanded the use of others, but
his objection was overruled and the three
wharves outlined granted.
James Gillls of Alameda said that there
would be no advantage in a new market
unless the sale of potatoes was restricted,
as the entire space granted for the use
of the new market will be devoted to the
storage of this particular vegetable.
Colnon overruled his objection on the
ground that the law said that vegetables
would constitute the chief product of sale,
and as potatoes were undoubtedly vege
tables, they Mould not consequently be
prohibited.
W. J. Pragan of San Jose and W. 1,.
Overhizer of Stockton of the committee
men appointed to represent the producers'
interests of their different sections of the
State briefly outlined that they were in
favor of the new market as represented by
Adams.
The amended request of Adams. In con
formity with the resolution adopted by the
Harbor Commissioners, Is as follows:
The object of th<* free market movement be
ing not to provide Rome special facilities
for farmers to sell their own produce, but to
concentrate the entire trade from first hands
In perishable products upon the water front,
; separate It from all othfr trade, subject It ttÂ»
regulation by State authority, Kive to farmer*
desiring to sell their own produce equal ad
vantages with those preferring to Fell through
commission men and permit any one to buy
there who so desires, the following are the
measures deemed proper to be taken at the
present time:
1. Declare all State property where perishable
products are sold part of the free market and
subject to Its regulations.
2. Set aside Pacific, Jackson and Washing
ton street wharves, with their bulkheads, for
the dockage of boats bringing perishable pro
ducts and the display and sale of same.
3. Assign so much space as is necessary for
car tracks and sheds for display at any point
to which the Southern Pacific Company will
agree to deliver produce coming by broad gaugÂ«.
lines, all other railroad lines being now pro
vided for.
4. Instruct engineer to report plan for rapid
and economical handling of produce In such
manner that lots consigned to same Indi
vidual by different lines can be concentrated
at one spot.
5. Set a day some time In the future, say
May 1, 1899, as the date when regulations will
be enforced and superintendent take office.
6. Invite producers' committee anil surh I
commission merchants as declarp thplr intpn
tliin >.f selling produce on the State property
tn propose, within thirty iiays. regulations for
the consideration of the Harbor Commissioners.
7. Invite producers' committee, commission
merchants or anybody else to nominate can
didates for sujx-rirnrndent. names to be sub
mitted not later than March 1. ISM. for elec
tion not later than April 1, 1899. The question
of assistant superintendent not to lie con
sidered until It Is seen that one is needed.

HE MUST GO TO WAR.
Horace Perrone Enlisted, out Later
Changed His Mind.
Horace Perrone, an Italian boy, was
brought before United States District
Judge Beatty yesterday morning in an
swer to a writ of habeas corpus sued out
by his uncle, Ose*a Perrone, to procure his
release from the army.
When young Perrone enlisted on June
19 he gave his age as 21 years and S
months, and made official declaration of
his Intentions of becoming a citizen of the
United States. He was assigned to the
hospital corps. His uncle, however, did
not relish the idea of the young man
serving Uncle Sam, and it is evident also
that Horace had a bau attack oC cold
feet, for when placed upon the stand he
solemnly swore that he was under 21
years of age. His uncle Osea also
thought that he was under 21. but could
not be positive. The boy's parents live
in Italy, but as he has- lived with his uncle
while in San Francisco he took upon him
self the duties of guardian. Deputy
United States Attorney Bert Schlesingfer
was present and argued that, as Oa i
had never been legally appointed guard
ian over the boy. he had no claim to him.
Judge Beatty ruled that as Perron.-' had
stated under oath when enlisting that I c
was over 21 years of age that statement
would hold over a contrary one made
when he was evidently anxious to have
the service, and accordingly remanded
him to the army. This is the Brst case
of this Kind that has been won by the
Government.
WILL NAME THEIR
CONVENTION DATE
REPUBLICAN COU2TTY COMMIT -
TEEMEN TO MEET.
Registration of Voters Is Not in
Keeping With What It Should
Beâ Haste Urged in the
Matter.
Preparations for the holding of the
forthcoming Republican State Convention
are already being made by the State Cen
tral Committee, of which Major Frank
McLaughlln is the chairman. The follow
ing call for a preliminary meeting has
been issued to the members of the com
mittee: .
"A meeting of the committee will held
at Golden Gate Hall. 655-629 Slitter street,
San Francisco, Cal.. on Saturday, July
23 189!;, at 1 p. m.
"The oject of the meeting Is to fix the
time and place of holding the next Re
publican State Convention, and to appor
tion the delegates therefor."
Major McLaughlln again urges upon the
voters of the Republican party the neces
sity of registration. Up to the present
time Registrar Biggy reports the volume
of registration as being entirely out of
proportion to what it should be at this
time. The total up to dato is only about
ten thousand, while it should have reach
ed a much larger figure. The tendency
of the voter is to put off the work until
the last moment. There Is usually a rusn
at that time and many men lose their
right to vote by being unable to register.

STAMPED WINE
RAISES PRICES
Restaurateurs Guarding
Against Losses.
COMBINE TO ADVANCE RATES
ONE-CENT STAMPS USED ON
QUART BOTTLES.
Children Must Eat French Dinners,
and Extra Wine and Dishes
Charged For at Double
Bates.
i
While the restaurant keepers are rais
ing a howl over the new stamp lnw and
petitioning fur a decision which will re
lieve th<Mn of the burden of stamping
table wines, they are determined not to
lose much before the decision arrives.
A number of the proprietors of restau- i
rants which furnish a French dinner for ;
2."j cents have formed a combination to I
raise prices until the decision has been |
received. Formerly an extra bottle of
wine with the meal would cost 5 cents per j
pint and 10 cents per quart; under the new ;
schedule it has been raised to 10 and 15 j
cents. Lest this should not cover the cost |
of the stamps, however, the price of ex
tra dishes has been doubled. There is no
possible tax on these extra dishes, but the
restaurant keepers are not taking any
chances.
Kirschwasser and cognac were formerly
served at dessert free when desired, but
the placards now read "a superior quality
will be served in small glasses for 5 cents
extra." An extra pat of butter also costs
5 cents.
But should all these plans tjtil to make
up the deficit caused by the purchase of
stamps some of the wily feeders of the
hungry have hit upon another plan which
will work admirably unless the agents of
Uncle Sam feel it their duty to put a stop
to it. The same bottles and the same
corks are used over and over again and
the simple device of making the stamp do
service as often as the cork has been
found to work to perfection so far, al
though the revenue collectors may have
something to say about It later on. It is
also said that in some places 1 cent
stamps are being placed on quart bottles,
which should bear a 2-cent stamp, the
excuse being made that, as the bottles
hold a little less than a quart they do not
come under the head of quart bottles and
a pint-stamp is sufficient. This, however,
is a fallacy, for the 2-cent tax applies to
bottles holding "more than a pint."
The whole case is becoming daily more
Interesting and has been the subject Â»f
many heated arguments In and about the
Federal buildings as well as in the res
taurants. The restaurant keepers see but
one side to the argument; that it is un
just to pay the tax and are determined
to avail themselves of any loophole which
promises escape, and finally light the
matter out in the courts if necessary.
Some restaurants not in the combine are
selling wine without any stamps at all.
Placards advertising the increased
prices have been posted conspicuously in
many 25-cent French, Spanish and Italian
restaurants about town, and are signed
by J. M. Semeria, Henry LeÃlanch. Wean
