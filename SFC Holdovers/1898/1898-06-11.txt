Escaped Injury prom trje Arrjeri

Prison at Santiago.
NEW YORK, June 10. â When the news was received
of the bombardment of the Santiago fortifications by the
American fleet on Monday no little anxiety was aroused
throughout the country lest some injury might by chance
have come to heroic Hobson and his brave men, who were
confined at'Morro Castle, at the entrance of Santiago harbor.
Fear that harm might have come to them was increased when
it was known that, in spite of Rear Admiral Sampson's or
ders that care be taken not to hit the part of the Morro
where they were supposed to be confined, some American
shells were thought to have hit the fortifications near their
quarters.
To settle all doubts on the subject the Herald tele
graphed to F. W. Ramsden, British Consul at Santiago, ask
ing him if he could kindly inform the friends of the prison
ers and the nation at large, through the Herald, how the pris
oners fared. To-day Mr. Ramsden sent in reply the following
dispatch:

The gunners took positions at
their posts, where they were or

The ships' searchlights were kept
playing on the water.
In the fort ammunition was
hurried to the big guns, and
troops were ordered to their
posts. Some of the officers were

and buglers were dispatched for
them. The men scurried out of
the hotels half dressed and hast

the Maryland troops orders were
given for the men to sleep in their
clothes with their guns close by.
A dispatch that came from
Washington, stating that one of
the vessels seen was probably a
German freighter, had a tendency
to allay the excitement among
the guests at the hotels, but the
officers did not relax their vigi
lance.
CAPTAIN GLASS
HAS ORDERS TO
SEIZE THE GROUP
Monterey Reported to Have Received
Instructions to Seize the Caro
lines While En Route.
NEW YORK, June 10.â The Herald's Washington correspondent tele
graphs: There is reason to believe the monitor Monterey has work cut
out for her, and that she will seize the Caroline Islands. After having caused
the Spaniards to surrender, and left small garrisons to hold the islands
seized, the Monterey will proceed to Manila, where she will re-enforce Ad
miral Dewey. No interference with this programme is anticipated by the
authorities in view of the present condition of Spain and her inability to send
re-enforcements to the Far East.
NEW YORK, June 10. â The Herald's Washington correspondent telegraphs: It is said to
night that the American flag is flying over the Marianne or Ladrone Islands, a group belonging to
Spain, iooo miles to the east of the Philippines.
Under instructions given him before his departure from San Francisco, Captain Henry
Glass, commanding the cruiser Charleston, was directed to proceed to Guajan, the most important
of this group, the only island upon which Spain had a force of soldiers, and require the surrender
of the enemy's men and to take possession in the name of the United States.
I have known of this instruction since before the departure <
i of the Charleston from Mare Island, but have kept silent until
| now, when the instructions are undoubtedly carried out, because
i of the apprehensions of officials that the publication of the infor- \
[ mation would cause the Spaniards to re-enforce the garrison at <
â¢ Guajan and thus make more difficult and dangerous the task of !
[ Captain Glass in conquering the island.
It was because of the necessity of having a landing force that the Charleston waited at Hon
olulu for the arrival of the transports with troops aboard. The troops were under command of
Major General Anderson, and he was directed before his departure from San Francisco to co
operate with Captain Glass in accomplishing the defeat of the Spanish force in the Ladrone
Islands.
No doubt exists in official circles that the Charleston by this time has reached Guajan.
During the run from San Francisco to Honolulu she made an average of 300 miles a day, and on
one or two occasions made 350 miles. Proceeding at her average rate â the rate which a trans
port will easily be able to maintain, it is estimated by the officials that she would have made the
3000 miles separating the Hawaiian Islands and Guajan in ten days.
If, as is believed, she left Honolulu on May 31, she has thus covered the distance, and by
now has taken possession of the island. It is not believed the American force had much difficulty in
taking Guajan. The Spaniards have two small forts at the island, and just*before the war broke out
sent a few guns and troops to re-enforce the garrisons. These are not believed to have been
large enough to have given any trouble to the American forces.

WASHINGTON, June 10.â
The statement that the real ob
ject of the Charleston's voyage
was the seizure of the Spanish
Ladrone Islands has a basis of
truth in it.
When it was decided to send

Mare Island to Manila, it was
well known that this could not
be done without sending along

coal supply of the monitors. It
was not deemed practicable to

Department would be to seize
some Spanish islands, such as the
Ladrones or the Carolines.
Therefore, it is assumed that if
the Charleston really goes to one
of the former islands it will be
with the purpose of securing in
advance a suitable harbor for the
use of the monitors.
DECKLOAD OF COAL
WASHED OVERBOARD
So the Monitor Monterey and Collier
Brutus Put Into San Diego for a
Fresh Supply.
ON BOARD THE MONITOR
MONTEREY IN SAN DIEGO
HARBOR. June io.â The United
States monitor Monterey, which left
San Francisco on Tuesday afternoon
for Manila in company with the collier
Brutus, came to anchor in the harbor
here this afternoon with most of her
deckload of coal gone and her bunkers
about half empty. The monitor, after
she passed the lightship off San Fran
cisco harbor, squared away in the regu
lar steamer course for Honolulu. There
was a fresh northwest breeze blowing
and a moderate beam sea running when
she passed out that kept her deck fore
and aft awash, but she steamed alone:
at a good clip, and her officers were
jubilant at a prospect of making the
Hawaiian Islands in less than ten days.
Shortly before dark the Brutus began
to show signs of distress. She was well
astern of the monitor, and at times she
would swing from her course until she
presented her full broadside to the
Monterey. First she would swine to
port, then to starboard, and once she
made a complete circle. She was too
far distant for her signals to be read,
and on the monitor it was^lhought that
she had become disabled. The Monterey
was turned back and headed for her, and
just when darkness was setting in the
two vessels were near enough to use
the wigwag signal, and tnen it was in
ferred that her steering gear had given
way. An hour later the Brutus flashed
a signal that repairs had been made, and
again the two vessels stood away on
their course to Honolulu.
During all this time the wind was in
creasing in violence, and by midnight it
was blowing half a gale. Big green
seas were rolling and tumbling from I
starboard to port across her decks. '
and on several occasions huere combers
washed over the tops of her turrets.
Every sea that came aboard her had a
most destructive effect on the oiles of j
sacked coal that were lashed about heF j
turrets.
At midnight several sacks on each
pile on the starboard side had gone
over the side, and with their departure
the lashings that held their companions
were weakened. The vessel was put
under slower speed with a hope of sav
ing what was left. For a couph of hours
all went well and the storm showed
signs of abating. Just before daybreak
of Wednesday, however, when Captain
Leutze was congratulating himself on
having saved the deckload from the
storm, a huge wave, seemingly greater
than any during the night, thun
dered at the vessel and broke squarely
over the side. Amid the tumult of wa
ter that washed over the deck there
came a snapping of ropes and wire
cables, and when, the steamer lifted from
the sea her starboard side from stem
to stern was clear of its deckload.
The vessel was swung with her stern
to the seas and all hands were called
to secure what little was left on the port
side. Scarcely a third of her deckload
remained, and it was estimated that
about 125 tons of her coal supply had
been lost.
Captain Leutze decided that his
wisest course then lay in running before
the seas to San Diego, there recoal and
make another start for Honolulu.
Although more than ninety miles fur
ther from Honolulu than when he left
San Francisco, the commander finds
consolation in the thought that by tak
ing the southern route to the Hawaiian
Islands the vessel will be less apt to
meet with unfavorable weather and at
the same time fall in with the north
east trades sooner after clearing the
land.
On the way down the coast, and when
in the Santa Barbara channel, an ex
periment was made with the Brutus as
a towboat. The collier hauled the Mon
terey during the greater part of Thurs
day afternoon at a little over seven
knots an hour, and as a result- of the ex
periment the Monterey's officers were
of the opinion that the coast defense
vessel would have no difficulty in reach
ing the Philippines in a shorter time
than was anticipated and in good condi
tion.. The Monterey will sail from here
to-morrow afternoon.

Plot to Overthrow the
Monarchy.

Copyrlgrhted, IS9B, by James Gordon Bennett.
GRANADA, Spain, June 10.â A politi
cal personage with whom I had the
honor of conversing in Madrid did not
conceal the facts of the present situa
tion, that an active propaganda was
being carried on in industrial centers
by socialists and agitators. The Span-
ish Government feared a serious ris
ing in these centers, I was told. Sev
eral questions, among others the bread
and silver questions, had created dis
content among the miners and factory
hands of Andalusia, and it was feared
that the effervescence anticipated be
fore long in Madrid would first breakout
in Andalusia and spread like a spot of
oil through the peninsula.
That is why I have left for the mo
ment the capital, where everything is
quiet, and have come to make an in
vestigation on the spot from Linares
to Guadia, obtaining information es
pecially from the managers of various
enterprises and from workmen of in
dustrial districts.
Andalusia, which extends from Li
nares to Guadia by way of Balmes,
employs 25,000 men, without counting
those at fourteen sugar factories round
Granada. It is thought here that the
Socialists still carry on an active prop
aganda. Close surveillance has been
ordered by the Government, which has
everything to fear from these men,
islands in the Pacific, quite as numer
ous, though not so great in area nor so |
populous as the "Pearls of the Indies,"
which Dewey has just added to Uncle
Sam's string.
The one group, the Ladrones, or the
Mariana Islands, was the first group
met by Magellan as he crossed the
broad Pacific in his voyage around the
world in 1521, ten days before he dis
covered the island of Zebra of the Phil
ippine group and met his death at Mac
tan. This group is some 1200 miles east
of the nearest point of the Philippines
and comprises seventeen islands with
a large number of islets and reefs. The
chain stretches from north to south be
tween 144 and 148 degrees E. longitude
for some 600 miles, and they are esti
mated by Behren and Wagner, the Ger
man geographers, to have a total area j
of 560 square miles.
At the time of the first occupation by I
the Spaniards the native population, j
composed of Indonesian and Papuan i
races, was estimated at over 80,000 souls, |
but the present population composed |
mostly of half-breeds hardly exceeds
that number.
The capital and chief town is Agana,
on the island of Guam. This group,
with the Carolines, is under the juris
diction of the Governor-General of the
Philippines.
All these are of volcanic origin and
some of them rise to a height of 2000
feet.
The name "Carolines" is applied to
'. the whole of the widely scattered aich
ipelago lying between 3 degrees and 11
minutes north latitude and stretching
from 135 degrees to 177 degrees east j
longitude, or through some 2500 miles
I right over the equator.
Until lately the Spanish have claimed
j the whole, but the eastern part, known
as the Mulgrave Archipelago, composed
of the Gilbert and Marshall groups, are
now claimed by Germany, leaving to
Spain the central gfoup, or the Caro
lines proper, and the western gro in,
known as the Pelew Islands. This
group, though five in number, has one
island, Babelthaup, with an area of
275 square miles, while the area of all
is some 350 square miles. The popu
lation is about 14,000. They are of a
dark copper color and are of Malay and
Papuan origin. Every village is a sep
arate and distinct republic. Though
the nearest to the Philippines they
know at the present day but little, ex
cept in name, of Spanish rule.
The Carolines proper, called after
Charles II of Spain, consist of forty
eight distinct gro.ups comprising a to
tal of some 500 islands with a large
number of islets and reefs. Of these
Ualan on the far east and Puynipet and
Rug, to the west, have an area of some
330 square miles, while all the rest are
less 'than 40 square miles in extent.
This archipelago is known as the
"New Philippines, and from Ngoli on
the west to Ualan on the extreme east
the distance is about ISOO miles with an
average breadth of 350 miles. They are
mostly of coraline formation and gen
erally low, though some of them, Ruk,
Ualan and Ponapi, attain a consider
able height, the latter being some 2860
feet high.
The fauna is poor, but the vegetation
is luxuriant. The population, mostly
of Indonesian stock, is estimated at
30,000, two-thirds of whom live in the
three islands of Ruk, Yap and Panapi.
Yap is the center of administration for
the whole.

â whose discontent may be excusable,
since they are crushed by hard work,
are ill paid and merely looked upon as
human machines to be made the most
of.
I found, however, very different opin
ions in the district of Linares, where
lead mines are worked. Socialism, even
anarchy, reigns over the majority. So
cialists and anarchists are very numer
ous. They are violently and irreconcil
ably opposed to monarchy, whether it
be the Queen Regent or Don Carlos.
They are revolutionary republicans,
and if an opportunity occurred would
stick at nothing to procure the triumph
of the cause they defend.
The war itself is not discussed. "Work
ingmen pay no more attention to it
than if it did not exist. I should be
surprised even if some workers were
ignorant that Spain was in armed con
flict with the United States. It is only
the consequences of war, the rise in
prices, increase in taxation and the
money crisis that specially affect the
lower classes and country people. Their
discontent is confined to this. What are
Cuba and the Philippines to them?
These colonies never brought them any
thing and do not concern them.
It may well come to pass that the up
heaval which threatens SpaJn may start
from Linares, where the bitterest op
ponents of the existing regime are ad
mirably organized. At present the
storm is muttering, and when it bursts
its effect will be. terrible. It will have
an unfortunate echo through the realm
which numbers many malcontents,
whatever is said to conceal the truth.

SEATTLE, June 10.â The steamship
Rosalie arrived in port to-night from
Lynn Canal and Wrangel with 130 pas
sengers. They report that the Stick
een River route is about impassable
and scores of gold-seekers are turning
back every day. High water is the
worst hindrance encountered, and at
the present time dozens of river boats
are tied up along the banks of the
Stickeen. The route between Glenora
and Lake Teslin also is reported to be
in very bad condition.
News from Lake Bennett was received
at Skaguay just before the departure
of the Rosalie to the effect that the
rwks along the White Horse Rapids
are playing havoc with the boats bound
for Dawson. Up to May 2i, when A. L.
Hall left the rapids on his way to
Skaguay, forty craft of various kinds
had been wrecked in the narrow, dan
gerous passage. Abundant precautions
for the saving of life had been taken,
so that all the passengers were rescued.
Very little freight was saved. The
river at Fifty Mile is unusually low.
Hall reports a new placer strike in
a draw on the shore of Lake March,
about eight miles from the head of
Fifty Mile River. Nearly all of the
ground in this vicinity has already
been staked off, although bedrock has
not been reached.
The Japanese steamship Amur, which
reached Skaguay on June 5 from Vic

of the river steamer Iskoot, which is
a wreck in Kum Ea Ton Bay. It is
probable the Amur will strip the wreck.

Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, June 10.
Shortly before 4 o'clock this after
noon the conference report on the war
revenue bill was agreed to by the Sen
ate after a discussion lasting four
hours. The debate on the measure was
without special Interest and" was en
tirely devoid of acrimonious features.
The debate indicated generally that the
bill as agreed upon by the conferees
was reasonably satisfactory to every
body except as to the bond provision.
The votes cast against the adoption of
the report reflected the opinions of
those Senators who are opposed to any
increase in the interest-bearing debt of
the country.
The report was agreed to by the de
cisive vote of 43 to 22. Every Republi
can voted for the measure, and their
votes were supplemented by those of
eight Democrats, one Silver Republican
and one independent. The Democrats
who voted for the adoption of the re
port were: Caffery, Gorman, Lindsay,
McEnery, Mitchell, Morgan, Murphy
and Turpie; the Silver Republican was
Mantle and the independent was Kyle.
The vote against the report was cast
by sixteen democrats, three Silver Re
publicans and three Populists.
As soon as the engrossed bill can be
signed by the presiding officers of the
two branches of Congress It will be
sent to the President.
Just at the close of the session this
evening a bitter personal discussion
was precipitated by Butler (Pop.) of
North Carolina, who attacked Kyle for
having voted for the issuance of bonds.
Butler, speaking as the chairman of the
Populist National Committee, officially
declared that Kyle did not represent
the Populist party. Kyle replied warm
ly, saying that he was responsible for
his political actions, not to Butler, but
to his conscience and to his constitu
ents.
PLANS TO COLLECT
THE NEW WAR TAX
There Is Much Hard Work Ahead for
the Bureau of Internal
Revenue.
"WASHINGTON. June 10.â The Bu
reau of Internal Revenue is now busily
engaged in preparations for the en
forcemeut of the war revenue bill,
which, it is expected, will become a law
in the same form as passed by the
House. Nearly the entire work in
volved will fall upon the internal rev
enue service, the exceptions being the
bond issue and the coinage of the sil
ver in the Treasury. The increased tax
upon beer that has been removed from
the brewery premises and stored will
be collected by assessment, as will also
the additional tax of 3 cents per pound
imposed on stocks of tobacco outside of
factory premises and the additional tax
on cigars and cigarettes, where such
stocks of tobacco, snuffs, cigars and ci
garettes are in excess of the exempted
quantities â that is to say, 1000 pounds
of manufactured tobacco and snuff
and 20,000 cigars and cigarettes.
While the collection of the above
taxes by assessment, instead of the af
nxiner of additional stamps, will greatly
simplify the work in this connection,
yet there are many blanks to be pre
pared, printed and distributed within
the thirty days allowed, in which those
interested are required to make returns
upon their stocks on hand.
The hardest problem presented to the
Commissioner, however, is the prepar
ation of designs and the printing of the
vast quantity of stamps which will be
required for the schedules A and B,
under which stamps are required for
almost every character of commercial
transaction from the ordinary bank
check to the first mortgage bond of a
trunk line railway.
Another problem will be the devising
of methods and regulations for the
taxing and supervising of what is
known in the bill as "mixed flour."
SWORD FORDEWEY AND
MEDALS FOR HIS MEN.
Board Appointed to Put Into Effect
the Joint Resolution Passed

BY AN INDIAN
Prospectors Tell of a
Remarkable Find.
BRITISH COLUMBIA BONANZA
EETUBN LADEN WITH YELLOW-
SEAMED QUARTZ.
Claim They Discovered an El Dorado
After, the Death of Their
Guide Had Been
Decreed.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, June 10.â One of the
roughest looking parties that ever came
out of the gold regions reached here last
night and stopped at the Granville Hotel.
Their clothes were in tatters, their hands
and faces blistered terribly by the sun,
and their frames mere skeletons. Their
outfit consisted solely of a few firearms
and aeveral bulgy looking canvas sacks.
In spite of their woe-begone appearance
the strangers seemed cheerful, and if the
story they tell is true they have every
reason to be.
The sacks contained quartz which upon
being assayed here went $900 to the ton,
and they claim it was not picked. Theirs
is the most marvelous story ever brought
from the gold regions. It seems almost
incredible, but every member of the party
tells it with an air of sincerity.
In January last Ferguson Melville. M.
E., R. M. Ferguson of Seattle, John
Gardiner of Boston and Henry Condon of
Minneapolis started from Seattle for the
Cariboo country to discover the mother
lode. They had abundant provisions and
a good outfit. They reached Ashcroft in
February and struck due north. At the
Indian village of Pan Van on the trail
they met a young buck named Charles
Brunei, a graduate of the Carlisle Indian
College, Pennsylvania, and a cousin of
Sitting Bull, who stated he could guide
them to a mountain of gold 300 miles
north.
The party jumped at the bait and the
Indian led them a weary march 400 miles
north, toward what is known as the un
explored country. Day after day the
party was kept in compfete ignorance of
their location and depended solely on
Brunei. The latter kept up their hopes
by stories of the golden mountain, and
lured them further into the wilds. Dis
aster followed the party, for in fording
a mountain stream they lost most of their
outfit. When sixty days out of Ashcroft
they began to suspect the Indian and
threatened him with death if gold was
not found within three days. Brunei then
struck d^ie west, toward the coast range.
For a week the men traveled with little
food, and became mere skeletons. Twice
they were attacked by grizzly bears, and
a night watch was kept to guard against
mountain lions and wolves, which were
numerous.
At the expiration of three days' grace
given the Indian, and upon his failure
to find any gold, the party held a coun
cil of war and decided to shoot him. The
buck held to his original story and
showed no signs of fear. This was three
weeks ago and the party was then near
the coast range. Another day was given
the Indian and he used it in taking them
to an immense body of rock on the shore
of a small lake about 200 miles north of
this city.
There he pointed out what appeared to
be glittering gold on the surface of the
rocks. Two of the party, inexperienced
miners, fairly hugged the Indian, and
were about to gather in the supposed
vast riches, when Melville told them
that it was but "tenderfoot pride," a
bicarbonate of mica.
Now comes the strangest part of their
strange trip. The death of the Indian
was fully decided upon, and one of the
party was deputed to shoot him. He was
to die at nightfall. During the day Mel
ville prospected around the spot, and he
claims to have made a marvelous find
not 100 yards from where the false gold
was found. He brings his $700 in quartz
to substantiate his story.
Needless to say, the Indian's life was
saved, and the party gathered consider
able quartz and started for civilization,
reaching here last night. They estimate
they have traveled SOO â  miles of rough
country and have fairly cornered a good
fortune. Melville, of course, will not tell
the location of his find.
The men will return next week and ex
pect to remain until next December. Bru
nei, in Indian fashion, got drunk
reaching here, and the others are keeping
guard over him to see that he does not
reveal their secret to outsiders.
ADMIRAL CERVERA
IS DULY WARNED.
Told That if He Destroys His licet
Spain Will Have, to Pay Addi
tional Indemnity.
WASHINGTON, June 10.â The Navy
Department has sent orders to Admiral
Sampson to notify Admiral Cervera
that if the latter destroys his four ar
mored cruisers and two torpedo de
stroyers to prevent their falling into
our hands Spain at the end of the war
will be made to pay an additional in
demnity at least equivalent to the
value of those vessels.
It has been realized all along that the
Spanish admiral, rather than permit
his fine fleet to be added to the United
States navy, might at the last moment,
when he saw that further resistance
was useless, prefer to blow it up. It
was assumed at first that if Cervera
cared to do this nothing could be done
to prevent it. Even now he may prefer
to send his ships to the bottom and let
this country exact such reparation as
it may p<v> fit. The Navy Department
hopes, however, to convince him by the
foregoing argument of the folly of do
ing anything so rash.
COMMANDERS OF TWO
SHIPS ARE INVALIDED
Harrington of the Puritan and Ever-

NEW YORK, June 10.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: On
account^ of the terrific strain and the
heat under which they have been la
boring in Cuban waters since the be
ginning of the war, Captain Purnell F.
Harrington, who, for more than a year,
has been in command of the Puritan,
and Lieutenant-Commander W. U.
Everett, whose command was the Man

treatment in the Naval Hospital at Key
West.
Orders issued to-da" direct Captain
Frederick Rodgers, formerly president
of the Auxiliary Cruiser Board, to take
command of the Puritan. A dispatch
received from Key West announced
that Lieutenant John W. Stewart, ex

HAVANA'S DEFENDERS
IN .WANT OF FOOD
Copyrighted, 189S, by James Gordon Bennett.
KINGSTON, Jamaica, June 10.-The British cruiser Talbot has ar
rived here. She left Havana on Tuesday with thirty-eight English
passengers, ten of whom were women. The women included members
of the British Red Cross Society.
The passengers report Havana quiet. Food is scarce and this is par
ticularly true of flour. More than half the bakeries are closed, and
others, which are only filling outstanding contracts, expect to close
within a few days. One bakery was besieged by a mob, and when it
closed 260 persons inside the shop were clamoring for the privilege of
purchasing bread.
Eggs are now a luxury, and have been taken from the regular
menu at the hotels. They are supplied only at large extra cost.
The Spanish soldiers are grumbling that they are starved and the
Government owes all of them from nine to twelve months' pay.
Petty officials live by extorting blackmail and demanding extra
charges on everything. Meat is plentiful, as 800 cattle were recently
landed at Batabano. Paper is worth 14 to 16 per cent of its value and
a centen is worth $9 in silver.
Captain Blanco is endeavoring to encourage the citizens with bom
bastic bulletins, reporting American defeats. He has issued orders
prohibiting the dealers from raising the price of food but it has had
little effect.
FORMIDABLE FLEET
TO ACT AS CONVOY
Guarding Against Danger of Attack
Upon the Transports by Spanish
Ships.
WASHINGTON, June 10.â Another
formidable American fleet has been as
sembled, consisting of sixteen warships
of various classes, headed by the big
battleship Indiana, which, for all-round
effectiveness, stands at the head of the
navy. This fleet is assembled at Port
Tampa, and is to serve as a convoy for
the transports from that purt. The for
mation of this formidable convoy fleet
is due to reports, more or less indefinite,
that Spanish warships were lurking be
tween Florida and Cuba with a view of
intercepting the transports. In order to
avoid the slightest possibility of a dem
onstration by Spanish ships against the
troop ships this new fleet . of sixteen
warships was determined upon.
This powerful fleet of convoys is
strong enough, both in number of ships,
also in individual ships and armament,
to cope with any Spanish ships that
might be at large, and it entirely elim
inates any possible danger that might
attend the transporting of the army of
invasion to Cuba.
Captain Taylor, who commands the
Indiana, is available as commander of
this squadron, although it is not dis
closed definitely who will be its chief.
Commodore Watson is with the block
ading fleet off Havana, and cannot well
be spared from that position, which will
be maintained efficiently, notwithstand
ing the drafts made to create this large
convoy squadron. Captain Taylor is re
garded as one of the most judicious and
capable officers in the service, and
should the squadron command fall on
him, it is felt that it will be in able
hands. The Indiana will probably be
the flagship of the convoy squadron.
There probably will be other battle
ships, but it is not deemed advisable,
for prudential reasons, to give the full
list.
The Indiana is one of the most for
midable ships afloat, being regarded by
naval experts as superior, as a fighting
machine, to the ships of the Terrible
class in the British navy. She has a
displacement of 10,288 tons and has a
main battery of sixteen large guns, be
sides many smaller rapid-fire and ma
chine guns in her secondary battery.
Her largest guns are of the 13-inch
class, four in number, mounted in tur
rets, two forward and two aft.
The desirability of forming this fleet
was suggested by information, coming
through official channels, that Spanish
ships left Barcelona some days ago,
bound for Cuban waters. This infor
mation came to the State Department.
It was to the effect that the ships in
cluded three Spanish warships and one
transport. The information was re
garded as trustworthy. It was commu
nicated to the Navy Department and
led to careful consideration. A little
later came the report from the ships
off Florida that suspicious looking ves
sels with military tops had been seen in
the offiing. These last reports were re
ceived with some credulity, but naval
officers were disposed to dismiss them
as myths. They were treated lightly,
and some of the officials spoke of the
matter as another case of the phantom
ship, the Flying Dutchman. But the
better advised ones, knowing of the re
ports as to the sailing of Spanish ships
from Barcelona, looked upon the mat
ter as one which should not be consid
ered too lightly. A single troop trans
port, carrying no armor, might be at
the mercy of some stray Spanish ship,
and there was no purpose to hazard the
lives of fifteen hundred men on any of
our ships when reports came from two
widely separated sources, one of them
quite in detail, of the approach of the
SpaniFh ships.
Besides the fleet of sixteen convoy
vessels there will be from thirty to fifty
transport ships, making in all a re
markable flotilla.
The War Department to-day gave out
an official list of the transports thus far
hired in order to clear up erroneous re
ports. The list shows fifty ships char
tered along the Atlantic coast and ten
on the Pacific. Those along the Atlan
tic will be used, in the main, for em
barking troops from Florida and those
on the Pacific for the troops going to
Manila.
TALK OF EUROPEAN
INTERVENTION REVIVED.
Belief in Vienna That the Russian
Government Soon Will Take the
Initiative.
VIENNA. June 10.â The Government
has decided not to initiate mediation
between the United States and Spain,
as it wishes to avoid the appearance
of making intervention seem only a
dynastic action in the interest of the
Queen Regent, which might perhaps
give fatal offense.
Nevertheless a decided opinion is
held that the time for intervention Is
very near at hand, although a hesita
tion to take the first step is evident
everywhere. The probability is that
Russia will undertake the initiative
within one or two days.
It is known that the American Gov
ernment has become more approacha
ble on the subject of intervention. With
regard to the Philippines, no doubt ex
ists in official minds in Vienna that
the islands cannot remain in the hands
of America. The insurgents there re
ject all foreign control, and, moreover,
it is scarcely conceivable that America
could provide a sufficient force to en
able her to take full possession of so
extensive a group of islands. The prob
ability is that the powers will find a
way out of the difficulty by re-estab
lishing a sort of protectorate, which
perhaps England might undertake.
One fact, however, is incontroverti
ble: The united Cabinet are agreed
that the Philippines must remain an
open market for the commerce of the
world.
MADRID, June 10.â It is reported
Germany will propose a meeting of the
European conference to discuss the
question of the Philippines. An inter
view which the German BmbaaÃador,
.Count de Radowitz, baa bad with Duka
Alrnodovar de Rio, Minister of Foreign
Affairs, has provoked general comment.
INSTRUCTIONS TO GUIDE
RECRUITING OFFICERS
Conditions TJnder Which Volunteers
May Be Accepted for the Second
XJall.
WASHINGTON, June 10.-The War
Department has just issued instruc
tions for the guidance of the officers of
volunteers detailed to recruit for their
own organization to fill them to the
maximum figure under the second call
of the President for 75,000 men. Appli
cants for enlistment must be between
18 and 45 years of age, of good charac
ter and habits, able-bodied, free from
disease and must be able to speak the
i^ngush language. Married men will
pc enlisted only upon the approval of
the regimental commander. Minors
must not be enlisted without the writ
ten consent of a parent or guardian,
me term of service is two years. For
infantry and artillery the weight must
"Pt fae le ss than 120 and not more than
190 pounds, and for cavalry the weight
is not to exceed 165 pounds, though re
cruiting officers are authorized in their
discretion to accept desirable appli
cants ten pounds or less overweight or
underweight.
For a regiment the maximum of all
grades, commissioned and enlisted,
must not exceed 1326 infantry or 1255
in cavalry. For a company the maxi
mum of all grades is 106 in infantry,
100 in cavalry, 173 in field artillery and
200 in heavy artillery. Wherever prac
ticable tfie choice by an accepted ap

regiment or other organization for
which the recruiting officer is making
enlistments should be respected.
WOULD ENLIST CHINESE .
ON THE PHILIPPINES
CLEVELAND, June 10.â Dr. Joseph
F. Chan, a Chinese physician, highly
educated and a naturalized citizen, re
siding here, has conceived a novel plan
for rendering assistance to the United
States in driving the Spaniards from
the Philippine Islands and has offered'
his services to the Government to aid
in carrying out the plan.
Dr. Chan proposes to enlist in the
United States regular army or to re
ceive an appointment as surgeon. He
will ask for authority to enlist a party
of about 200 of his fellow countrymen
in San Francisco and to take them to
the Philippines and do missionary work
among the Chinese residents of that
country. Dr. Chan says that of the
9,000,000 inhabitants of the Philippines
3,000,000 are Chinese. They are taking
no part in the insurrection against the
Spaniards, but are strongly opposed to
Spanish rule. He says that the Chi
nese in the Philippines are almost en
tirely ignorant of the United States,
but if he can go over there he would
influence them to become in favor of a
government of the islands under the
control of the United States, and would
organize a large army of Chinamen to
fight under the -s and Stripes and
to become allies in the army of inva
sion.
The doctor is in correspondence with
Governor Bushnell and the War De
partment at Washington in reference
to his plan.

ON BOARD THE ASSOCIATED
PRESS DISPATCH BOAT WANDA,
off Santiago de Cuba, June 9, via King
ston, Jamaica, June 10.â In Santiago
de Cuba there are about 20,000 Spanish
soldiers, chiefly infantry, but with a
fair contingent of cavalry and field ar
tillery drawn from the surrounding
country. During the daytime the cav
alry skirmish in the vicinity of the
city, returning at night to the bar
racks. During the last few days the
activity of the Spaniards has been par
ticularly noticeable. Oxen trains have
been making their way to the bat
teries, detachments have been working
on emplacements and there have been
other signs showing that the Spaniards
are preparing a desperate resistance.
Some guns from Admiral Cervera's
ships may be moved to the forts. The
Insurgents, about 5000 strong, have
taken a position on a mountain to the
westward. Two thousand Insurgents
of this gathering are unarmed. General
Maximo Gomez, now about 150 miles
inland, is making his way toward the
coast. Admiral Sampson is actively
co-operating wJth the insurgents. Yes
terday Getfteral Miniel of the insurgent
forces and his staff went on board the
New York for a long consultation.
The naval officers have been doing
splendid and daring work in carrying
communication and arms to the insur
gents and makii.g trips ashore for the
purpose of gaining Information. Upon
the gunboats Suwanee and Vixen this
work has chle.ly devolved. Lieutenant
Sharp of the Vixen and Lieutenant
Commander Delhanty of the Suwa
nee have been daily entrusted with im
portant missions and have carried
thorn out successfully. The Vixen's
work has been chiefly confined to car
rying messages to and fro, but the
Suwanee has been occupied in a more
serious taÃk. This little gunboat has
landed 300,000 rounds of small arms am
munition, 800 Springfield rifles, 100 car
bines, 2000 machetes, with equipments
traband, acting as a privateer, or in
other way violating the neutrality
laws.
REAR ADMIRAL MILLER
DOUBTS THE REPORT
Believes Some "Ulterior Motive Actu
ated the Man Who Sent the
Cablegram.
"I do not believe there is the slightest
idea en the part of any one to obtain
letters of marque for the purpose men
tioned in this dispatch," said Rear Ad
miral Miller, commander of the Pacific
squadron, last evening, when shown the
telegrams from Victoria. "The story
has no doubt originated from interested
motives on the part of some one. We
would have the information before
they could get a vessel ready."
A well-known Alaska transportation
man, now in this city from Seattle,
smiled upon reading the dispatch from
Victoria.
"I am under the impression that it ia
a preliminary advertising story started
by the North American Trading and
Transportation Company," he said. "It
is on a par with its wild assertion of
last summer that its treasure ship was
in danger of being looted by Chinese j
pirates. It was on that ground the j
company asked the Government for an '
armed convoy. It was simply an ad- !
vertlsement of the Yukon gold fields,
with the view of booming the rush to >
the Klondike. I Bhould not be sur- I
prised to hear in a few days that the
North American Trading and Trans
portation folks have again applied to i
the Government for a convoy. In this
way the attention of the country, which
has been diverted by the present un
pleasantness with Spain, will again for ;
the time being be in a measure directed j
to the Klondike."
and provisions. They were landed yes
terday (Wednesday) about fifteen miles
west of Santiago, to some 800 Insur
gents, who came down to the beach,
the jnain body remaining in the moun
tains. The debarkation of supplies was
tedious but uninterrupted.
The Insurgents reported that irregu
lar engagements between their forces
and the Spanish cavalry were of daily
occurrence. The Cubans were hard up
for supplies and ammunition and were
overjoyed at the sight of the Suwa
nee's cargo. Some, almost ravenous,
hacked at the slices of bacon and ate
raw beef. They had been living on
limes, cocoanuts and sweet potatoes.
Ensign Gilpin of the Suwanee went
ashore and accompanied the Cubans to
their temporary camp inland, where he
found ten or twelve men badly in need
of surgical attendance. Bandages for
them were sent from the Suwanee.
The casualties were the results of a
brush on the previous night with Span
ish cavalry.
To the correspondent of the Associ
ated Press, Ensign Gilpin, describing
his experience at the camp, which is
about ten miles inland, said:
"I found the insurgents a rough-look
ing and mixed lot of boys and old men,
rigged out anyway, carrying arms of
all sorts, and all anxious to borrow
everything I had, from my blouse to
my revolver. Four Spanish soldiers In
uniform, carrying rifles, marched into
the camp while I was there and said
they wanted to Join the insurgents.
They were enrolled, but a close watch
was kept on them, as they belonged
to the civil guard. A Cuban soldier
told me such additions were not infre
quent. The Spaniards had Mauser
riflop, which were in fairly good con
dition."
Conservative authorities believe the
troops will have to carry out their plan
of campaign without placing much re
liance upon the insurgents. Several
i plucky young officers, like Ensign Gil
! pin, have made trips ashore and taken
l observations of the Interior harbor and
! the fortifications, locating the exact po
sition of Admiral Cervera's ships. It
is hardly likely, however, that the
Spanish admiral keeps them moored at
the same place both day and night.

WAR ALLIANCE
NOT POSSIBLE
Opinion of Sir Charles
Dilke.
ATTACKS LORD SALISBURY
EXCITING SESSION OF THE
ENGLISH HOUSE.
Chamberlain Defends His Birming
ham Speech From Bitter
Criticism by the Op
position.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, June 10.â Sir Charles Dilke,
in the House of Commons to-day, mov
ing a reduction in the Foreign Office
vote, attacked the Marquis of Salis
bury's foreign policy of concession. Re
ferring to the United States he said:
"Our better relations with the United
States are mainly due to the good in
fluence of her Majesty's Embassador at
; Washington (Sir Julian Pauncefote),
] for the Government's policy has been
rash and feeble. Everyone w~ i welcome
an alliance of hearts with America, but
' no alliance could be a war alliance."
Continuing. Sir Charles said he did
not believe in the possibility, mooted
by the Secretary of State for the Colo
nies (Mr. Chamberlain) of an alliance
with Germany.
Sir William Vernon Harcourt.theLib
j eral leader in the House of Commons,
: asking for information this afternoon
I as to the foreign policy of the Govern
! ment, proceeded to criticize at length
| the recent speech of Mr. Chamberlain,
Secretary of State for the Colonies, at
i Birmingham. He referred Ironically
I to the "pitiful spectacle of the Secre
tary of State for the Colonies standing,
j cap in hand before the powers and
I seeking an alliance, remarking: 'The
Chinese question must be settled on
! friendship and concert with Russia.' "
IHe asked whether It would not have
! been better for Mr. Chamberlain to
"postpone his insults to Russia" until
| the talked-of alliance had been se
i cured.
Mr. Chamberlain, who, on rising to
I reply, was received with Government
cheers and Irish Nationalist hisses, de
! nied there was any discrepancy be
tween himself and other members of
the Cabinet.
Mr. Chamberlain declared the object
I of his Birmingham speech was "not to
lay down a policy, but to state facts to
the country as to what I conceive to be
the conditions and great problems we
are called to face."
Repeating the leading features of his
Birmingham speech Mr. Chamberlain
declared :
"If it became known we were willing
to consider alliances It Is not unlikely
that advances would be made to us.
A mutual understanding with one of
the great powers would save a very
laree addition to the navy."
In concluding, he referred to the "Im
portance of a close understanding with
America," adding:
"In my opinion, on such a matter the
United States would not listen to the
Irish vote."
But whether England or America
were menaced, he said, he hoped it
would be found that blood was thicker
than water, and, without desiring to
force either nation to enter into an al
liance with which a majority of both
peoples did not thoroughly sympathize,
he would repeat his conviction that the
closer, the more defined and the clearer
the alliance between the United States
and England, the better it would be for
both nations and for civilization. Mr.
Chamberlain's speech ended amid loud
cheers from the benches.
John Dillon, the Irish Nationalist
leader, protested against Mr. Chamber
lain's insults to the Irish in America-
Sir Charles Dilke's motion for a re
duction in the Foreign Office vote as a
rebuke to the Government's foreign
policy was rejected by the House by a
vote of 254 against 128.
A. J. Balfour, First Lord of the
Treasury and Government leader, re
plying to a question as to whether, "in
view of the condition of the population
of Cuba and the sufferings and evils
arising from the Spanish-American
war, her Majesty's Government or any
of the European powers have any in

Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, B. C, June 10.â Late
mall advices from Hongkong contain
interesting details regarding the ne
gotiations between the Philippine rebel
chief Aguinaldo and the United States
offiicials at Singapore Just before the
actual outbreak of hostilities between
Spain and the United States, as a re
sult of whicH General Aguinaldo en
tered into direct relations with Admiral
Dewey while that officer was still at
Hongkong. A conference between
General Aguinaldo and United States
Consul General Pratt at Singapore was
arranged by Howard W. Bray. Mr.
Bray and others were present at the
conference and Mr. Bray acted as in
terpreter.
General Aguinaldo explained to Con
sul General Pratt the incidents and ob
jects of the late rebellion, and described
the present disturbed state of the coun
try. Aguinaldo then proceeded to de
tail the nature of the co-operation he
could give. In the event of the Ameri
can forces landing and taking posses
sion of Manila, he would guarantee to
maintain order and discipline among
the native troops and inhabitants in
the same humane way in which he had
hitherto conducted the war and pre
vent them from committing outrages
on defenseless Spaniards beyond what
was Inevitable in fair and honorable
warfare. He further declared his abil
ity to establish a proper and responsi
ble government on liberal principles,
and would be willing to accept the
same terms for the country as the
United States intended giving Cuba.
Consul-General Pratt placed himself
at once in telegraphic communication
with Admiral Dewey at Hongkong, be
tween whom and Mr. Pratt a frequent
interchange of telegrams took place.
As the result another private interview
was held at the American consular res
idence between Aguinaldo, Mr. Pratt,
Mr. Bray and Mr. Leyba.
As a sequel to this interview, and in
response to the urgent request of Ad
miral Dewey, Aguinaldo left Singapore
for Hongkong, where he met Dewey,
with whom he went to Manila.
At the beginning of hostilities Agul
naldo's policy embraced the independ
ence of the Philippines, their internal
affairs to be controlled by European
and American advisers. The ports of
the Philippines would be free to the
trade of the world, safeguards being
enacted against an Influx of Chinese
aliens, who would compete with the in
dustrial population of the country.
There would be a complete reform
of the present corrupt Judicature of the
country under experienced European
law officers. Entire freedom of the
press would be established as well as
the right of public meeting. Full pro
vision would be given for the exploita
tion of the natural resources and
wealth of the country by roads and
railways and by the removal of hin
drances to enterprise and the invest
ment of capital. Spanish officials
would be removed to a place of safety
until an opportunity offered to return
them to Spain. The preservation of
the public safety and order and the
checking of reprisals against Span
iards would naturally be the first care
of the Government in the new state of
affairs.

Now That He Has Prepared the
Way for Investing Eastern Cuba
Sampson Awaits Invaders.
WASHINGTON, June 10.â The Navy Depart
ment to-day posted the following bulletin:
"On June 7 Admiral Sampson ordered the Mar
blehead, Commander McCalla, and the Yankee,
Commander Brownson, to take possession of the
outer bay of Guantanamo. These vessels entered
the harbor at daylight en June 7, driving a Spanish
gunboat into the harbor, and took possession of the
lower bay, which is now held by the Marblehead."

DISPATCH-BOAT, OFF SANTIAGO
DE CUBA, June 10 (via Kingston, Ja
maica, June 10). â Rear-Admiral Samp
son is impatient at the delay in the ar
rival of troops at Guantanamo. The
Spanish batteries there were silenced
on Tuesday with little difficulty, and
several vessels of the fleet are now pa
trolling there, presumably awaiting the
arrival of the landing party. One of
the men from the Herald-Call dispatch
boat landed at Guantanamo this morn-
Ing, but ho saw no signs of either Span
iards or insurgents. The Marblehead
â¢was there on Wednesday with Captain
of Marines Goodrell, who inspected sev
eral places suitable for making a land
ing in force. Ships of Admiral Samp
son's fleet are now patrolling the shore
between Santiago de Cuba and Guan
tanamo, a distance of about thirty
miles. The battle-ship Oregon, Mar
blehead and Yankee have been detailed
to hold the harbor at Gunantanamo.
The masts and stack of the sunken
collier Merrimac. in the entrance to the
harbor of Santiago, have disappeared
from view. The Spaniards are trying
to destroy tho wreck, but it is said to
be constantly under the guns of the
two big warships. Two guns were
fired at the fleet from the fortifications
yesterday. A report has reached Ad
miral Sampson that the Vizcaya was
Blght^d on the northern coast of Cuba,
but the report is discredited.

and its towns and harbors seized and

The harbor of Guantanamo Is a fine
basis for land and sea operations. It is
spacious and has forty feet of water.
The land approaches are not so pre
cipitous as at Santiago de Cuba. The
low-lying hills can be easily reached
with trains of siege guns and there are
level roads to Santiago thirty-three
miles distant, where * few mountain
batteries, beyond the reach of the fleet,

tiuantanamo is an important place.
It has six miles of water harbor and
will be of great value to the United
States army and navy as a supply
station, coaling depot and cable ter

defense. Their batteries were silenced
on Tuesday by the Marblehead in a few
minutes' liring at 4000 yards. A small
Spanish gunboat ran away.
The navy's work has been done well.
Day and night ships patrol the thirty
miles of coast within easy gun range of

The Marblehead returned to Guan

It Is believed the city can be captured
within a few days and that Admiral
Cervera will be compelled to fight.
The destruction of the shore batteries
now makes possible their occupation by
troops, giving the American fleet an op
portunity to enter the harbor and re
move the mines at the entrance and
strike a joint biow of the army and
navy, involving the surrender of the
Spanish troops in the eastern provinces,
now practically all concentrated at
Santiago de Cuba, and the surrender
or destruction of Admiral Cervera's
fine ships, which would necessarily
have an important, if not controlling,
influence In closing the war.
It is with this view that such close
watch Is maintained to prevent the es
cape of the Spanish ships, and neces
sarily the presence of the soldiers is
required to prevent the defeat of the
work thus far accomplished by the
navy.

ANNEXATION
BROUGHT UP
Newlands' Resolution Is
Before the â¢ House.
FILIBUSTER OF OPPONENTS
FINALLY THEY ARE PROMISED
A FAIR DEBATE.
So It Is Agreed to Argue the Propo
sition Until Next Wednesday,
When a Vote Will Be
Taken.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, June 10.
The feature of the day's session of
the House was the securing of an
agreement to consider and vote upon
the Newlands resolution to annex Ha
waii. Beginning to-morrow the debate
will proceed until 5 o'clock next "Wed
nesday afternoon, when a vote will be
taken.
The annexationists' camp to-day de
termined to force consideration, and
for three hours the opposition filibus
tered. Consideration of the resolutions
to-day could ha*ve been prevented, as
under the rules a recess until the even
ing session necessarily would have
been taken until 5 o'clock, but it was
plain that the annexationists would
win their victory to-morrow. Realiz
ing this, and knowing the resolutions
would pass and go to the country, in
volving a prominent issue, the opposi
tion treated fur liberal debate, and their
demands were granted readily.
Eight Democrats voted with the an
nexationists in the movement to-day to
force consideration of the resolutions,
they beiir- Berry of Kentucky, De Tries
of California, Livingston of Georgia,
Brucker of Michigan, Cummings, Sul
zer and Vehslage of New York, and
Cochran of Missouri. It is claimed
at least twentw Democrats will favor
the passage of the resolutions.
The bill to enable volunteer soldiers
to vote at Congressional elections was
passed and a number of minor meas
ures, chiefly of a private nature, were
considered.
The Lacey bill, providing for the par
ticipatinn of volunteer soldiers in Con
gressional elections, was called up when
the House met to-day. It being the privi
leged business under continuing order.
Cummlngs (D.) of Now York moved to
recommit the bill with Instructions for the
committee to report it with an added pro
vision extending thÂ« suffrage provision to
members of the naval reserve. A rollcaU
was taken, resulting in the defeat of the
motion to recommitâ ayes 100 noes 120 â
and the bill was then passed, 195 to 42.
Maguire (D.) of California, from the
Elections Committee No. 2, then called up
the report In the. case of William Ryan
against H. C. Brewster, from the Thirty
litst New York District.
Grosvenor (R.) of Ohio, pursuant of the
purpose of the Hawaiian annexationists
to force to-day. If possible, the taking up
of the resolution Immediately, raised the
question of consideration against the elec
tion case. Upon a rising vote, the House
decided not to take it upâ ayes 77, noes
78â and Maguire demanded a rollcall.
Meantime, Cannon (.R.) of Illinois, turn-
Ing to Grosvennr, Inquired: "I want to
ask the gentleman from Ohio if the rais
ing of the question in consideration means
the bringing up of Hawaii?"
"It does." responded the Ohioan, with
much vigor.
The vote resulted ayes 92. nops 129. and
the hearing of the election case having
been refused, Ray (R.) of New York
called for the regular order, which, under
the rules, would be the private calendar.
Grosvenor moved to consider public
business. A vote was then taken and th*
call was followed with much interest, the
House realizing the result probably would
mean the consideration or the Hawaiian
resolution.
Grosvenor'i motion prevailed. 140 to 88.
The opposition to annexation then began
to filibuster, a rollcall being demanded
upon the consideration of a resolution
calling upon the Secretary of War for
names of civilians appointed to military
office since April 24.
The vote resulted in the dffent of the
opposition, and another rollcall had been
demanded upon another minor matter,
when, pending the call, order was
brought out of chaos and an understand
ing was reported cjulckly whereby the
House agreed to be- gin consideration of
the Hawaiian resolutions and debate
them from day to day until 5 o'clock next
Wednesday afternoon, when a vote shall
be taken. The agreement was applauded.
As soon as the Hawaiian situation was
cleared several private bills were passed,
and also onf fixing the status of volun
teer staff officers by placing them under
tho regular army. At 4:35 o'clock the
House aujournedl having agreed unani
mously to vncate the order for the even
ing pension session.

Randolph was set upon by two burly
prisoners in their cell. He was forced
to his knees and an endeavor made to
choke him. His cries for help called
Guards King and Leake to the scene in
time to prevent murder being com
mitted.
It is well known that the dangerous
drug constantly passes the prison gates
through the medium of visitors and
trusties. Any one who has seen the
farcical searching of these trusties can
easily understand .why the traffic
flourishes as it does. For some time
Randolph has been watching "Jack"
Kane, a third-term burglar from San
Francisco, and Joe Keyes, committed
from Los Angeles for burglary. These
men are cell-mates and are what is
known as peddlers of the drug. Learn
ing that they had opium in their cell
Randolph slipped up quietly to unlock
the door at the regular time. 6 o'clock
in the morning. As the door 6wung
open there lay the opium in small pack
ages scattered all around the cell.
As soon as the prisoners saw Ran
dolph they grasped package after pack
age and began to hurl them into the
yard. Randolph Jumped inside and was
immediately pounced upon by Kane,
while Keyes kicked the guard's feet
from under him. He went to his knees
and Kane tried to catch him by the
throat. Randolph's cries for help were
heard by King and Leake, who ran to
his assistance and overpowered the two
enraged convicts.
By this time many of the other pris
oners had c ngregated in the yard and
were busily picking up the opium and
concealing it on their persons. The rest
of the guards tried to take it away
from them and had about secured it all
when the convicts in a body set upon
the guards and tried to snatch the
opium from their Hands. They were
Beaten off and the opium, fifty-seven
packages in all, is now in possession
of the prison authorities.
Both Kane and Keyes were confined
in the dungeon and shackled to the
walls. To-morrow their cas^s will be
considered by the prison directors at
the regular monthly meeting. Kane is
in for fifteen years and will lose two
years' credits; Keyes is In for twelve
years and will be deprived of eighteen
months' credits.

THREAD COMPANIES COMBINE.
Proposed Absolute Monopoly in
Europe and America.
NEW YORK. June 10.â Semi-official de
tails concerning the consolidation of the
various American thread manufacturing
companies were made public to-day. The
scheme, which was promoted by J. & W.
Seligman & Co., embraces the amalga
mation of all the leading thread manu
facturing companies in this city and Eng
land. Sixty per cent of the capital stock
for the American Thread Company is
said to be controlled by the English com
panies, which have a capitalization of
$7.~>,000,000 while the American Thread
Company, which was organized with
English capital, holds only about $1,000,
000 worth of stock In the English corn
party. There are reports that the com
bined companies may buy in several large
factories in Germany and Belgium.
Should this be done, the combination will
have an absolute monopoly of the thread
output In Europe and America.

the body of Angelo Soto, the Mexican
who was killed by Policemen Bateman
and Hughes last evening while resisting

with a knife, and that it was necessary
to kill him. Soto was 48 years of age.
He had a bad reputation.

Report of: TF)eir Detention
at Key West Only ;
a f^use. ' *
American Regulars Will Land Near
the Beleaguered City on
Sunday.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, June 10.
It Is strongly suspected here to-night
that reports of the army transports be
ing detained at Key West for fear of
Spain's "phantom fleet" were indulged
in by war and navy strategists for a
purpose. The signal corps instituted
a most rigid censorship of press dis
patches at Tampa and Key West. That
it was effective is evidenced by the
fact that Eastern papers this morn
ing print dispatches from these points
dated June 6 (four days old), marked
"Delayed in transmission." Another
evidence of the efficacy of this censor
ship is the fact that no one in Washing
ton to-night has positive knowledge of
the whereabouts of the army trasports!
It is beginning to dawn upon the
press correspondents, however, that
they have been hoodwinked by the offi
cials. It is generally believed here that
although same of the troop ships may
have been detained at Port Tampa and
Key West, the main body proceeded
toward Santiago, and that the alleged
fear of the Spanish "phantom fleet"
was a ruse de guerre concocted in or
der to conceal the time our troops may
be expected to arrive at Guantanamo
Bay and thus surprise the Spaniards.
If the main flotilla of troopships pro
ceeded to Cuba without delay they may
be expected to arrive at their destina
tion On Sunday. A high official of the
Navy Department to-night confessed
that no fear of Spanish ships was
felt.
"We have no idea that there is a
single Spanish ship off the northern or
western coast of Cuba. The precaution
of holding the expedition at Key West
briefly was part of the original plan."
The Washington correspondent of the
Philadelphia Press (Postmaster-Gen
eral Smith's paper) telegraphs as fol
lo%vs:
"A report that the President had or
dered the transports to be detained at
Key West because of the appearance of
a Spanish squadron eighty miles from
Havana was incorrect. The President
has issued rto such order."
The report of a squadron of Spanish
ships, consisting of a battle-ship, two
cruisers and a torpedo-boat, having
been seen on Tuesday night ei^hr.y
miles west of Havana, sailing in the
direction of that port, is not credited
here. The auxiliary gunboat, which is
reported to have seen these ships, did
not report that they were Spanish ves
sels. The Spanish Government has
only one battle-ship, the Pelayo, which
Is at Cadiz, and is not likely to attempt
to cross the ocean. As that battle-ship
was at Cadiz three days ago it is im
possible that there could be any Span
ish battle-ship in Cuban waters. The
whole story Is Tery fishy.
But if the yarn is true the United
States has an ample fleet about Ha
vana to take care of any such squad
ron as that. The battle-ship Indiana,
the four monitors â the Terror, the Ara
phitrite, the Puritan and the Mianto
nomohâand the cruisers Detroit and
Montgomery, to say nothing of the aux
iliary boats forming the blockading
fleet, would be more than a match for
any fleet the Spanish could send to
Havana.
There is the best authority for stat-
r ADVERTISEMENTS.

Ing that an expedition will go to Porto
Rico very soon. It has been the in
tention to wait until Santiago was cap
tured, and that course may yet be fol
lowed, as it is expected the American
flag will fly over Santiago within the
next five or six days.
In case that result is accomplished
Sampson's fleet will sail for San Juan
and renew the bombardment of that
place. The troops, however, may land
at some distance from the city. The
War Department has taken means to
obtain full information in regard to the
strength of the Spaniards in Porto
Rico and no trouble in the capturing of
that island is anticipated.
It is certain an expedition will sail
for Porto Rico in the near future.
WEDDED AT NIGH T
ON ROLLING BILLOWS
Youthful Monterey County Couple
Join Hands Beyond the Three-
Mile Limit.
MONTEREY, Cal.. June 10.â The par
ticulars of one of the oddest weddings
that ever occurred hereabouts have just
become known and are serving as the
topic of the moment. Last Sunday J. W.
Thompson and Mamie Olsen, aged re
spectively 17 and 17*4 years, drove over
from Salinas, accompanied by the bride's
sister and brother-in-law. Mr. and Mrs.
J. S. Bankson, and endeavored to en
gage a minister to perform a marriage
ceremony for them at sea. Rev. H. S.
Snodgrnss. who is the clergyman always
sought by couples who resort to weddings
on the high seas off this point, positively
refused to pro with them on Sunday, and
they were obliged to wait until the Sab
bath was over. Immediately after mid
niprht. however, the party procured a
boat and set out, and when the three
mile limit was passed the ceremony was
performed. Magnificent moonlight char
acterized the night and added weirdness
to the romantic wedding.
The groom is employed at the sugar
factory at Spreckels and the Jjride was a
resident of Blanco.
STRANGE ACTS OF A HUSDAND.
Failed to Beport the Suicide of His
Wife and Was Very Indifferent.
NEW YORK, June 10.â The dead body
of Mrs. Andrew Hunt of Jersey City
was found hanging to the transom of a
door by her husband when he arose this
morning. He cut the body down and
placed it in bed. Then he prepared
breakfast for himself and three children
and, after eating the morning meal, took
the children to a neighbor, telling the
latter that his wife had killed herself.
He did not report the case to the police,
but went to his place of employment.
Subsequently he was called to police
headquarters to make an explanation. It
is reported that Mrs. Hunt hanged her
self because of domestic unhappiness.

THE FIFTY-FIRST IOWA VOLUNTEER INFANTRY JOINS
THE COLUMN FOR MANILA.
ALL the officers connected with the
work of getting the second Ma
nila expedition ready for de
parture next week are having i
their hands full, and are exert
ing every effort to have the men on
board the transports on time. General
JT. B. Babcock, General Merrltt's chief
Bf staff, states that the programme as
announced has not been changed. The
troops will embark next Tuesday and
an the following day the fleet, composed
of the China, Colon, Zealandla, Morgan
City and Senator, will sail for the Phil
ippines, touching at Honolulu.
Major J. F. Bell of General Merritt's
Btaff will sail for the Philippines with
the second expedition next Wednes-
Say.
Lieutenant-Colonel Potter, chief en
gineer on General Merritt's staff, will
probably remain in San Francisco un
til the general sails for Manila.
Majors Ruhlen and Wadsworth of the
United States volunteers, and Lieuten
ant Lopez of the navy have been ap
pointed as a board to make the pre
liminary examination of all vessels se
cured in this port for the transporta
tion of troops. Majors Ruhlen and
Wadsworth are also assigned to the
fluty of having the ships put in proper
condition for the reception of the men.
Lieutenant Quan, whose recruiting
office for the Third Artillery is in the
Phelan building, has received a tele
gram from the adjutant-general of the
army, stating that loss of teeth does
not disqualify a man for enlistment in
time of war. About twenty appli
cants have been rejected on this ac
count by Lieutenant Quan, and if they
will apply again their cases will be con
sidered. Most of these men were
otherwise qualified to serve in the
army.
First Lieutenant Chance has been as
signed to duty in the office of Major
Thompson in command of the Volun
teer Signal Corps.
Paymasters McClure, Whipple and
Kilbourne will this morning begin the
work of paying out to the Philippine
expeditionary forces the sum of $940,
000, which pays the entire command
now in San Francisco up to July 1.
At army headquarters yesterday the
information was given out that Camp
Merritt would be abolished gradually
and that the troops would not be moved
in a body from the Richmond district.
The expedition which is scheduled to
pall for Manila next Wednesday will
take nearly four thousand troops from
the camp and another expedition to fol
low a week later will take four thou
sand more. Then the remaining or
ganizations will be transferred to the
Presidio. Troops arriving thereafter
will be placed on the reservation. The
recruits arriving to-day will probably
go to Camp Merritt, but all other or
ganizations that may be ordered to the
j'arific Coast will be quartered else
where.
The officers of the Fourth United
States Cavalry have been officially In
formed that at least one squadron of
the regiment will go to the Philippines.
No orders have been received to pre
pare for the second expedition, hence
it is believed that the troopers will be
ordered to Join the third expedition. The
decision has been finally reached that
horses must be taken. The experiment
must be made some time and General
Merritt, therefore, decides to make it
with the horses of the Fourth Cavalry.
It is said that a ship will be specially
fitted for the accommodation of the
horses.

gallant and meritorious conduct during the Civil War. He added renown
to his brilliant record by efficient service in Indian campaigns since the War
of the Rebellion. On account of his worth and experience as an artillery offi
cer he was choeen by Major-General Merrltt to command the First Brigade
ot the Phllipploe Â«Â¥Pe<lHlonary. forces. m
landed at the Market-street ferry at 7
o'clock yesterday morning and surren
dered to the Red Cross Society without
the slightest resistance. The ladles had
been waiting for the lowans an hour; in
fact, they waited all day Thursday and
only recalled their outposts when they re
ceived definite Information that the troops
would not get In that night.
Colonel Loper was relieved of the com
mand of his regiment before he had got
half way across the apron to the docK
and led "a willing captive Into the new
quarters of the society In the San Rafael
ferry waiting room. The regiment was
conducted to one of the piers, where arms
were stacked and escorted by the First
Colorado Band marched Into the dining
room.
Special efforts had been made to give
the lowans a cordial reception, for they
had been entertained at many points
along the road and the San Francisco
ladies were determined that there should
be no chance for odious comparisons. The
tablea were filled high with brilllant-hued
flowers, which were used to bedeck the
boys In blue as sonn as they had appeased
their appetites with the steaming break
fast served by dainty hands. Six mem-
I ra of the command who are conval
escing from various complaints were sent
out to the field hospital In an ambulance.
During the meal the Colorado band per
formed several choice selections. TlTe
members, anxious to show their apprecia
tion of the treatment they had received
at the hands of the Red Cross Society,
volunteered thPlr services to welcome and
escort the lowa regiment to camp.
When the meal was concluded Colonel
.Loper mounted a tal>le and on behalf of
his officers and men thanked the members
of the society for their hospitality. He
closed by calling for three cheers for the
Red Cross, which was responded to with
a vigor that only true Americans can
muster.
While the regiment was forming- In line
the detail in charge of the baggage was
cared for by the ladies, who then packed
great hampers with provisions and gave
them to the guard to take out to camp
for the men's lunch. In addition to five
days' travel rations, the Fifty-first
brought ten days' field rations and com
plete me?? kits for each company. but, un
fortunately, the quartermaster's depart
ment did not furnish sufficient trucks to
transport the baggage promptly. so it was
after 4 p. m. when the wagon loaded with
rations and the Red Cross supplies
reached enmp.
Meanwhile the regiment started up
Market street. Its own and the Colorado
band alternating in patriotic airs. Early
as the hour was, thousands of people
lined the streets and cheered the stalwart
lowana lustily as they swung along.
Every man In the regiment was uni
formed, though a few lacked campaign
hats and leggings, and between 300 and
400 were without rifles. No regiment has
gone into camp in better condition than
Colonel Loper's command, which Is ready
to go to Manila as soon as it receives its
ordnance.
Out Golden Gate avenue to Devisadero
marched the regiment, and along Geary
street and Point Lobos avenue to First
avenue. Then back to Fulton street and
down Sixth avenue, marching in review
before Generals Otis, Greene and Miller,
and back to the block directly in front of
the Children's Hospital and east of the
South Dakotans. where it is located. The
tents arrived presently, and soon all the
canvas was up, but no provisions came.
The men made no complaint, but when
the hours dragged along to 3 o'clock and
many were faint with hunger, the Red
Cross Society was notified of the situa
tion. "Word was sent to the corps at the
ferry depot, ana supplies would have
been sent out to the hungry men, but the
ladies found that the food given to the
guard in the morning was then on the
way and would reach camp before fresh
supplies could get there. :iV?v..
When the food did get to camp, soon
after 4 o'clock, another cheer went up
for the Red Cross, and the men made
short work of the edibles. The Buzicott
stoves arrived with the provisions and
were soon in place; fires were built and
later the men had coffee and regular
field rations. To-day they will begin to
draw their rations of fresh beef and vege
tables. . â 
Guard was mounted at 6 o'clock and
the men settled down Into the routine
of camp life, with which they are en
tirely familiar, having been In camp at
Dcs Moines since April 26. If there is any
hard service at Manila It is a safe pre
diction that those lowa lads will give a
glorious account of themselves.
PRESIDIO NOT FAVORED
Troops at Camp Merritt Do Not
Want to Move to the
Reservation.
The first news of the proposed removal
of all troops now at Camp Merritt back
to the Presidio, the next expedition to
Manila excepted, first became known to
the officers and men yesterday through
thp columns of The Call. It can be said
that the proposed removal of the camp
does not meet with the approval of the
THE SAN FKAXCISCO CALL,, SATURDAY, JUNE 11, 1898.

COLONEL JOHN C LOPER, Fifty-First lowa Volunteers, Wno Arrived in San
Francisco Yesterday.
officers and men, and especially Is this
true among those of the Fourteenth In
fantry and the Seventh California. These
troops have experienced the hardships of
the Presidio as a camping ground, and
the removal question, now that the sol
diers are sottled. Is opposed throughout
Camp Merrltt. As far as can be learned
the removal of the camp Is based upon
the fact that the Presidio is said to be a
more desirable camp for sanitary rea
sons, and that a closer restriction can be
placed there upon the morals of the
men. Both of these facts are, in the
opinion of the medical officers, not worth
considering. The sanitary condition of
Camp Merritt is far superior to that of
the Presidio. The sandy soil of the for
mer is a ready absorbent of camp refuse,
while at the Presidio quite the reverse
was found to be the case. As far as
bettering the morality of the camp is
concerned, the same loose condition will
continue to exist as long as the present
laxity of the guard system prevails.
It now seems highly probable that the
camp will not be moved to the Presidio.
The best thing to be done under the cir
cumstances, according to the general ex
pressions of the officers, would be to move
the camp over beyond Oakland, or to
some place ten or fifteen miles from San
Francisco, bo as to get the men beyond
the demoralizing influences naturally en
gendered by proximity to a large city.
VOLUNTEER SIGNAL CORPS

occupy wherever it may be located, and
being one of the finest branches of the
service it receives more consideration

uniforms and will be armed with latest
pattern revolvers and. six-pou'id carbines
of the Krag-Jorgensen pattern. When it
does move it will go on the flag ship with
the division commander.

The Washington boys are very- asxlous
to go to the front with the next expedi

Their many friends at headquarters are
hard at work, however, and Colonel Fife
has assurances that they will be among

The many statements to the effect that

A TIMELY LESSON.
Merchants Will Find It Profit
able to Deal Squarely With
Uncle Sam.
Cities, as well as Individuals, will learn
In time that nothing is gained by taking
advantage of the Government's Immedi
ate necessities to advance the price of
goods. The Chicago beef men have been
taught a lesson and they are now "beef-
Ing." As the Government made demands
for large quantities of canned beef the
price was gradually advanced by the Chi
cago packers controlling the market un
til the article which sold for 9 cents a
pound at the breaking out of the war
was advanced to 14 cents.
The officers charged with the respon
sibility of procuring army supplies did not
say much, but one day recently an order
came by wire from Washington to add
canned salmon to the army ration. The
wav beef dropped when the salmon tele
gram came was startling. It went down
like a steer in the Chicago stock yards.
A merchant in this city at once wired
to a leading Chicago firm thla concise
message: "You have killed, the goose
CAPTAIN CARRINGTON, U. S. A, ON THE LIST FOR
PROMOTION TO BRIGADIER-GENERAL
that laid the golden egg." The respon
sive telegram was to this effect: "Re
duce the price of canned beef." It was
too late. The salmon had got in his
work, and as a result a market is estab
lished for one of the great products of
the Pacific. It is calculated that the sal
mon sufficient for an army ration, once
in ten days, will amount to 10,000,000
pounds annually.
Colonel William H. Baldwin, commis
sary of subsistence, has been ordering im
mense quantities of supplies in San Fran
cisco. A vast sum of money will he put
In circulation by reason of the extensive
orders lodged in this city. Colonel Bald
win understands his business much bet
ter than some of the dealers here im
agine. A few days ago he observed that
some men had combined to put up the
price of goods on Uncle Sam. He said
nothing, but went into the market and
had Macondray & Co. buy goods for the
Government as though the purchases
were on Individual account. The com
biners were hurt and consequently they
squealed.
NO NORTH OR SOUTH.
Veterans of the Blue and Gray
in the Idaho Camp
The Idaho battalions have the honor of
having in their midst a proof that
there Is no longer any North or South,
that the differences of nearly forty years
ago are forgotten and that to-day the
people of the United States are one.
Colonel Jones, commander of the bat
talions, was one of the bravest officers
in the Confederate service, while Major
McConville of the Idaho troops wore the
blue and served with conspicuous gal
lantry. It was In the seven days' struggle
around Richmond that these two soldiers,
who are now white-haired veterans, faced
each other in the daily encounters.
Colonel Jones was in the Fifty-sixth Vir
ginia under Longstreet, while Majnr Mc-
Conville served under Porter. To-day
these one-time enemies are comrades and
warm friends, and it Is with that certain
high regard for each other that brave
men always entertain for a fearless ene
my that they recall the past and rejoice
in the fact that they can at last stand
shoulder to shoulder under a common
flag.
RUSH OF APPLICANTS.
Activity at the Recruiting
Station of the First Cali
fornia Regiment.
The recruiting office for the First Regi
ment of California Volunteers, which was
opened in the Armory at Page and Gough
streets at 2 o'clock yesterday, did a rush
ing business during the afternoon. Cap
tain Naphtaly enrolled eighty-five men.
At this rate it will take only a few days
to secure the 300 recruits required to fill
up the First Regiment to the limit. Cap
tain Carrington will muster in these re
cruits as fast as they pass the medical
examination. They will be forwarded to
the regiment at Manila at the first op
portunity. The recruiting office hours are
from 10 to 12 and frum 2 to 4 o'clock.

BRIGADIER-GENERAL CHARLES KING, Soldier and Author, Who
Has Joined General Merritt.
Brigadier Genera! Charles King, more popularly known as Captain King,
U. S. A., is now In this city, and will be assigned to duty under Major Gen
eral Merritt. General King is a combination of the fighter and author, two
occupations which seldom run together. Personally he looks the soldier.
Though small of stature, he carries the air of a man who has seen service
in the field and one who has sought the bubble reputation at the cannon's
mouth.
General King wishes to be known as a soldier. Novel producing is to
him a side issue of life, attendant with a great meed of pleasure and offer
ing the means by which a comfortable living may be secured. The life on
the frontier, the raids of the red savages and the hand-to-hand conflicts of
the early day Indian fighting are all treasured recollections of the soldier
novelist. In his stories he lives the life of his fighting days over againâ the
days with William F. Cody and the brave cavalrymen in the Sioux cam
paign of '76.
The career of General King has been characterized by the swish of the
saber, the noise of the gun and the peace of National Guard service. Upon
his retirement from the regular army on account of serious wounds re
ceived in actual service on the frontier, General King received a commission
of high rank in the State of Wisconsin. When General Merritt was assigned
to this post he asked the President for a commission for Captain King,
which was almost immediately granted. General Merritt and General
King have fought for their country before in the same regiment and they
are friends both of war and peace.
As a litterateur nothing but success has marked the efforts of the au
thor of "The Colonel's Daughter." "Kitty's Conquest" and "The General's
Double." though "Kitty's Conquest" suffered the proverbial fate of the in
itial effort of all successful writers. It was sent to Harper's, and the usual
sorrow-provoking stamp of declination indorsed upon It by the omnipotent
publisher and returned to the expectant author. The story was thrown in a
trunk, made the tour of Western military posts, and would have been con
signed to oblivion had not General King tried again where the scalpel
wielding publisher cried no. The second book was published serially in the
United Service Magazine. This drew the attention of the Lippincotts and also
the Harpers. One day Harry Harper met King, and he wanted to know
why he did not send him his stories, promising that he would publish every
thing he wrote. The second time "Kitty's Conquest" was sent to a pub
lisher it did not come back. In all, General King is the author of thirty
novels, besides descriptive essays on the people, the country and the times
in which he has lived.
The frontier has been his chosen field In the past. The future may bring
forth something with an Oriental setting.
LISTED FOR PROMOTION.
In the distribution of brigadiers
it is said that California is entitled
to another star. There are many
applicants for the position, but,
according to inside advices Cap
tain Carrlngton, U. S. A., may re
ceive a commission as brigadier
general of volunteers In time to
permit him to take the leadership
of a brigade belonging to the third
expedition to Manila. Captain Car
rington has been on duty with the
National Guard of California for
several years and recently per
formed efficient service in muster
ing in volunteers under the first
call for troops in this State.
vision of the Philippine expeditionary
forces and is slated to sail for Manila
with the third expedition.
It was announced somi-officially yester
day that Brigadier General Otis had ap
pointed Captain Murphy, son cf United
States Senator Murphy of New York, ad
jutant general of the brigade. Captain A.
W. Kiniball, son of Colonel Amos S. Kim
ball, U. S. A., formerly chief quartermas
ter of the Department of California and
at present depot quartermaster, New
York city, has been selected brigade
quartermaster. General Otis is surely
calling to his assistance some of the
ablest young officers in the service. With
such gallant troops and excellent officers
the Fourth Brigade should make a fine
record at the front.
HIT BY A BULLET.
Casualty at Target Practice of
the Tenth Pennsyl
vania.
That the life of Private Conn, Company
H, Tenth Pennsylvania, was not snuffed
out yesterday morning is wholly due to
the hardness of his head and the fact
that he was hit by only half a bullet.
As it is he is lying in the hospital of his
regiment suffering fever and pain from a
severe though not dangerous scalp
wound.
Conn was acting as marker in the rifle
pits at Camp Merritt while a squad of
men from his company were having a
practice shoot.
A bullet, not too well directed, struck
a bolt of the framework of the target
and splinters of lead flew in every direc
tion. One of these struck Private Conn
in the head, rendering him unconscious,
and in this condition he was taken to the
regimental hospital.
His attendants say that a few days of
camp treatment will put him again in
fighting trim.

DRIVEN from San Francisco and forced to
abandon an attempt to establish themselves in
San Mateo County, the pool-sellers are con
gregating at Sausalito in such numbers it is doubt
ful if the town can hold them all. Rivalries and jeal
ousies are reported to have broken out among them,
and a battle is imminent for the possession of the
field. The former monopoly of the traffic is at bay
against the new comers and a hot time is expected.
That such a contest should be waged in Sausalito
is not to her credit, nor is it to the interest of her
people. Among the localities around San Francisco
none has greater natural attractions than Sausalito,
none could with better reason expect to become the
suburban home of the wealth and culture of the
metropolis. All such expectations, however, will be in
vain if the town falls under the domination of the
gambling element and becomes the established resort
of pool-sellers and their prey.
The evils of the pool-selling traffic have been re
peatedly exposed by The. Call. They include tempta
tions which in too many cases lead women, young
men and even school-children to gamble. From the
time the gambling mania is once fixed upon the mind
the downward course is rapid. The inveterate player of
the races soon begins to resort to all manner of tricks
to obtain money for the game, and not infrequently
becomes a betrayer of trust, a forger and a thief. All
this is well known. It will not be any different in
Sausalito from what it has been elsewhere, and it be
hooves the people of that community to weigh well
the consequences of permitting the open running of
poolrooms in their town.
It may cause a hot time in Sausalito to drive the
pool-sellers out as was done in San Mateo, but Sausa
lito will have a hotter time if she does not. Instead
of becoming the home of some of the better elements
of the people of the city she will become the resort
of the worst. Her boys and girls will grow up sub
ject to evil influences, her young men will be con
tinually enticed to betray the trust of their employers,
and scandals and crimes will become common things
in her local history.
Good examples have been set for Sausalito to profit
by in this regard. A short time ago, under the in
fluence of a crusade begun and vigorously carried on
by The Call, the authorities of Ynlo suppressed a gang
of gamblers who, driven out from Sacramento, had
made their headquarters on the Yolo side of the
river. Recently San Mateo, profiting by the exposure
of the pool-selling evil made in The Call, drove the
illicit traffic out of that county. In San Francisco it
self the traffic, according to reports made to the Mer
chants' Association by Chief of Police Lees, has been
suppressed. Now it is the turn of Sausalito to act.
Captain Aaruus of a German steamer now at Phil

maritime laws. As he is the same truculent indi
vidual who loudly proclaimed a wish that the Span

fenses than the one mentioned. He ought to be
kicked as well as fined.

While Chief Lees proclaims that he will continue

fl BARBARIC YAWP.
NEVER since the day when good old Walt Whit
man invented the phrase has there been in the
United States Senate a wilder illustration of a
"barbaric yawp" than the speech made by Senator
Tom Carter on the report of a bill granting American
registry to certain steamers needed by the Government
for use as transports. Mr. Carter did not discuss the
bill itself. He had learned that a steamer, the Cen
tennial, hailing from Puget Sound, had been rejected
by United States officers at this port, and that fact
was the theme of his raucous roar.
The Senator began by declaring he knew nothing
of the Centennial, and then went on to say she had
a first class clearance from Vancouver and had for
merly been used as a transport in the Japanese ser
vice and afterward as a hospital ship by the same
Government. From a man who knew nothing of the
vessel that much information concerning her was re
markable, but not so remarkable as the conclusion he
drew from it. She was a transport ship In the service
of Japan years ago, the Senator argued, so why com
plain of her now as a transport ship for us? Just so
a country landlord is reported to have once rebuked
a traveler for complaining that a towel was dirty by
assuring him "there have been fifty men wiped on that
towel and you are the first to say it isn't clean."
Knowing nothing of the subject, according to his
own confession, Senator Carter maintained that the
rejection of the Centennial had been procured by cer
tain shipping interests in San Francisco in order that
the owners of those interests might hold up the Gov
ernment and extort from its needs high rates for ships
furnished for transport purposes. A charge of that
kind, made without a single scintilla of evidence on
which to rest it, can be fitly characterized only as a
lie. One does not like to use that word with reference
to a United States Senator, but that is the only proper
one in this connection.
Since the Alaskan rush began last summer the
people of this coast have had fearful warnings of the
danger of sending untrustworthy ships to sea. In this
port we have had the tragedy of the Almy almost
within the Golden Gate, and between this point and
Juneau many a wreck has occurred to emphasize the
truth that an old hulk is not to be trusted on the deep
sea simply because in years gone by she was a stanch
good ship and made voyages half round the world.
The rejection of the Centennial was made for the
protection of the brave men who are to be carried by
the Government to the Philippines to uphold the flag
of the nation in war. To have sent troops to sea in an
unfit vessel would have been a crime as foul as trea
son and murder combined. That in itself furnished
sufficient reason for the rejection of any vessel whose
seaworthiness is at all doubtful. When Senator Car
ter, knowing nothing of the matter, sought for some
other explanation of the rejection and finding none
invented the theory that it had been done in the in
terests of the shipowners of San Francisco, he passed
the limits of fair debate and put himself in the cate
gory of those reckless and vindictive orators who
render their malice harmless by venting it without
any regard for veracity.
BOSSISM BOILED DOWN.
THE unrepresentative character of the committee
of one hundred appointed by the "whispering"
Boss McNab and his coadjutors in political
conspiracy to take charge of the Democratic party of
this city ought to appall the Democrats of the en
tire nation. If there is any one thing more than an
other for which Democracy stands it is the right of
"the people" to be represented in party committees
and party conventions. Yet here is a case in which
not only have the State bosses ignored the rank and
file of the party and the people in this city, but in
which they have fastened upon them an appointed
committee with full power to filch their political lib
erties from them. If the 'whispering" boss were
really a Democrat â which, being a Hessian, he is
not â he would stand aghast at the enormity of his
own acts.
There are in this city eighteen Assembly Districts.
To create a county committee for either party of a
representative character it would be necessary to ap
portion it among them according to the vote cast at
the last election. In 1896 the Democrats carried nine
Assembly Districts and the Republicans nine. Seven
of the Democratic districts are south of Market
street, and therefore in order to be representative a
county committee of that party would have to be
elected or appointed mainly from among the Demo
crats of the Twenty-eighth, Twenty-ninth, Thirtieth,
Thirty-first, Thirty-second and Thirty-third Assem
bly Districts.
The committee of one hundred appointed by Boss
McNab to rule the Democracy of San Francisco has
not only not been chosen from these Democratic
Assembly Districts â it has bee.n chosen from the Re
publican districts. Seventy-three of its members
come from regions which never return Democratic
legislators. Seventeen reside in the Fortieth Assem
bly District, which in 1896 gave 809 Republican ma
jority; eleven reside in the Thirty-ninth District,
which gave at the same time 571 Republican majority;
thirteen reside in the Thirty-seventh, which gave 160
Republican majority. Here is the way "Whispering"
Gavin has taken care of the party of which he claims
to be a member: Twenty-eighth District, 379 Demo
cratic majority, 1 representative; Twenty-ninth, 731
majority, 3 representatives; Thirtieth District, 540
majority, 2 representatives; Thirty-first District, 919
majority, 2 representatives; Thirty-second District,
405 majority, 1 representative, and so on.
One Democratic Assembly District only has been
properly recognized. We refer to the Forty-fifth.
This region gave 140 Democratic majority at the elec
tion in 1896. It has upon the committee of one hun
dred nine representatives. The good fortune of the
Forty-fifth is accounted for by the fact that Boss Mc-
Nab himself resides in it.
The interesting question in connection with the ap
pointment of the committee of one hundred is this:
Will the Democrats of San Francisco stand it? Boss
McNab's theory is apparent. All he wants of the or
ganization is to secure its right to a place on the offi
cial ballot. He will nominate his tools for office, call
them "Democrats," and with his newspaper organ
demand their election in the name of "reform." In
this way he hopes to get control of the local govern
ment. A more flagrant case of bossism has never
been developed in this city. It is enough to make
"Whispering" McNab's preceptor, the late Mr. Hig
gins, turn over in his grave.
Sampson's shells at Santiago are said to have been
worth half a million dollars, but they cost Spain so
much more than this that nobody minds the expense.
Since a price of $25,000 has been put on the head of
Aguinaldo it is likely the head that wears a crown
is not the only one to rest uneasy.
Something more than an expression of displeasure
ought to be visited upon any contractor who furnishes
the camps with tainted meat.
There is a natural tendency to despise a spy, unless
he is spying for our side
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JUNE 11, 1898.
Q MERICANS know one flag. This is the stars
/ \ and stripes, the sign of liberty and unity. There
are streamers of special significance afloat
over the ships of the navy, and some of the higher
officials of the Government have individual flags, but
for the people of this great country there is one
token of common brotherhood, one emblem, the
shadow of which is a protection to the humblest
upon whom its shadow falls. At sight of it the heart
beat quickens and there comes over the beholder an
impulse to defend the honor of the colors even at the
cost of life. So it is that the flag is floating above
far shores that had been alien, while brave men are
on the sea hastening to uphold it there where justice
has reared it. So it is that the men of the navy have
covered themselves with fame. The flag had been
assailed; they fought for it, and, unsullied, it catches
the tropic breeze.
It was June 14, 1777, Congress adopted a resolu
tion: "That the flag of the United States be thirteen
stripes, alternating red and white, and that the union
be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing
a new constellation."
And to-day such is the flag, except that the thir
teen stars have grown to be forty-five, and the little
collection of colonies is a giant nation. Next Tues
day will be the hundred and twenty-first anniversary
of the adoption of these colors. It could not fittingly
be permitted to pass without a demonstration such as
the country has never witnessed. On that day the
flag should be displayed from every housetop and
pole. It s-hould decorate the schools, the places of
business and the citizens themselves.
In this time of war feelings that ordinarily lie dor
mant have been aroused. Men and women are con
scious, gladly, of a thrill of love for their country, an
impulse to do something to show how they revere
the flag and all it represents. They shower favors on
the soldiers, willingly and eagerly, because the regard
for the soldiers going to battle for this flag is an ac
tual affection.
There is a quaint Oriental expression terming
America "the land of the beautiful flag." Such it is.
But the beauty of the token is not alone in its com
bination of hues. It is the beauty of an honored his
tory and a cause ever just; a beauty appealing to the
soul as to the eye. And on Tuesday next, when the
flag shall have reached the age of 121 years, now that
the sentiment of the country has been stirred to its
deeps, that men are dying and offering to die to
preserve it, there should be a demonstration, radiant,
tumultuous, splendid, widespread, to mark the event.
There cannot be too many flags on show. There
cannot be too great a wave of enthusiasm.
Her* Sy the Golden Gate which opens now to new
possibilities, the Golden Gate whence America
reaches out to the distant isles, through which the
armed strength of the republic pours to carry liberty
and civilization, it is meet that the demonstration be
grand in its unanimity and fervor. We are all pa
triots. We love the flag. Let us spread it to the
Western winds that day until the city shall be as an
army with banners, proclaiming the stars and stripes
its colors, and glorying to see them fly.
AFRESH political breeze blows from Oregon.
The Republicans of that State declared openly,
plainly and without reservation for the single
gold standard, retirement of greenbacks and sound
money.
The Democracy, Populists and free silver Repub
licans fused, tight and fast, on free silver, unlimited
paper issued by the treasury, and the whole line of
fads in the Populist platform. The fusion programme
was a regular political bargain counter, intended to
attract customers with any kind of wheels in their
head.
The result is the greatest Republican victory Ore
gon has had in many years, and the fusion forces are
scattered in ghastly and hopeless confusion.
The vote stands: Republican 35,648, fusion 28,078,
with a few small counties to hear from, which will
increase the Republican total much and the fusion
total little.
The Bryan Democracy in Oregon can now take its
bearings and see how much it has gained under the
leadership of Pennoyer, Miller and Burnett.
In 1888 Oregon gave Cleveland 26,519 votes, to
Harrison's 33,269. That was the last straight party
vote in the State. The natural increase in the Dem
ocratic vote should be about 4 per cent per annum,
or 10,607 votes in the ten years since 1888, and the
straight party vote should have been this year 37,026.
Therefore the fusion policy of Pennoyer has deprived
the party of its natural accretions and leaves it
weaker in fusion alliance than it would have been
standing alone.
Herein is a warning to Republicans. The history
of political fusion in the United States is that when
ever parties suppress or abandon their principles to
enter into such alliances the resulting fusion is finally
weaker than the original, straight party would have
been standing alone.
The best of party leadership is exhibited in stand
ing stiffly by principles and educating the people in
them until a majority comes to agree to them. Vic
tories waited for and won by that policy are won to
stay.
With the single exception of Mr. Cleveland's
twelve years' leadership and Mr. Tilden's brief
rule, the Democracy has had no principles that it
was not willing to abandon for the sake of a fusion
which promised office to a few of its self-seeking
I leaders. Beaten in 1888 on the free trade issue, Mr.
Cleveland compelled it to fight on the same line four
years later, and won. The party in power had not
the devotion to its own principles necessary to carry
them out, and a Democratic Congress failed so
j wretchedly in its tariff tinkering as to cause Mr. Cleve
j land to declare that the Wilson bill represented noth
ing but perfidy and dishonor. In 1890 the party sur
rendered the free trade issue, and in defiance of its
traditions took up fiat money.
Note now the difference between Republican stead
i fastness and Democratic weathercocking. The Re
publicans were beaten in 1800 and in 1892 on the pro
tection issue. There arose among them a school of
j cowards and opportunists, who sought alliance with
! Populism and free silver to make a substitute issue for
protection, which they desired to abandon. The party
I stood steadfast, however, and its fidelity to its prin
! ciples even in defeat caused the bolt at St. Louis and
the organization of the free silver Republican party,
which is looking around now for a sty and a swill
barrel, and seeks to fuse with the same elements that
have just had their quietus in Oregon.
Spain is said to believe the Philippines lost. Much
depends on the point of view. To many people
they seem just to have been found.
Let none of our boys be sent to sea in unseaworthy
ships. The occasion demands sacrifice, but not by the
boatload.

UNDER ONE FLAG.
THE WORK OF FUSION.
BLUE AND THE GRAY.
MUSIC PLAYED ON THE BALTI
MORE AFTER DEWEY'S BATTLE.
ON the Ist day of May the American naval force at Manila completely
the Spanish fleet. On the following day the Baltimore and the
Raleigh went to the forts commanding the entrance to the bay and
demanded their surrender. The Spaniards surrendered those works.
The mechanical and deadly precision of the first day was succeeded by
the business-like demand for surrender on the second day. Nothing is more
characteristic of American seamen than their return on the third day to a
semblance of routine, the cool, brave, imperturbable Yankee! On May 3,
while the Spaniards were beside themselves with rage and excitement, the
Americans, at ease on board their trusty ships, had musical relaxation. The
band on the United States steamship Baltimore played from a programme
which was printed in colors on board ship, and which was headed by "Old
Glory." Among the selections was "The Blue and the Gray," token of the
ability of Americans both to fight and to forgive. The programme in use
on that occasion has just been received in this city in a letter addressed to
Mrs. M. A. Kelton, 714 Howard street, by her son Harry, who was one of
the brave crew of the Baltimore. The same music will be played at one- of
the concerts in Golden Gate Park for the historical interest attached. Be
low is a fac simile of the programme:

A story is told
on William
Sproule, traffic
manager of the
Southern Pacific
Company, which
shows how genius
and versatility
will sometimes lead a man into the slough
of error. Mr. Sproule has a reputation
for cleverness as a raconteur and as a
man of polite learning. His mind is of
that order which has a place both for
figures and for the artistic. One of those
things of which he is especially proud Is
his stupendous familiarity with the sym
bols of rank, political and social. No
matter how much of the alphabet is at
tached to the skirts of a name Mr.
Sproule is never at a loss in determining
the position of the owner in the world
of the bon ton. In the select coterie of
wits and bon vivants at the Bohemian
Club many a task of alphabet reading has
been performed by Mr. Sproule. But the
hardest task of the kind that he ever at
tempted was one afternoon not long ago
when a Mr. Murphy called on him at his
business office. The card brought to
the railroad magnate read: "Edward
Murphy, O. B. C." Who was Murphy,
and what was all "this alphabetical adorn
ment? "G. B. C." went through the
mind of the dilettante and no solution
was offered by the powers of reason or
the stores of a vast experience. All the
abbreviated titles of royalty were con
sidered and still no light. Exhausted by
the mental strain Mr. Sproule told the
office boy to show Mr. Murphy to his
office at once.
The first question launched at the vis
itor was: "What in the world does G. B.
C. stand for?" Murphy grew two inches,
and with a swelling chest and erect head
answered in a very dignified manner:
"Sir, that means graduate of business
college." The shock was too much for
the erudite Sproule and he succumbed at
the awful discovery. Mr. Murphy was
there for a position. He did not get it.

OTJR FIVE WARS.
Making war has never been a business
with the American people. With a great
country to be opened, great industries to
be organized, and all the affairs of an ac
tive and ambitious people to be conduct
ed, we have had no time to waste. We
have not needed war to give our young
men occupation, nor the elder ones re
ward, nor have we been driven to amuse
and divert the people by fighting: our
neighbors. Yet in the 122 years of our ex
istence we have had five wars, each im
portant, each waged for different reasons
Dut all in some degree animated by one
principle.
And it is to be noted that each hag
found us unprepared; each has been de
nounced by a large section of the people,
and yet they have all been conducted with
a spirit and concert which finally made
them national, uniting the country in
some common purpose which was devel
oped or strengthened by the wars them
selves. â Philadelphia Public Ledger.

docs on Lost River, where their opera
tions caused so much complaint that an
order was issued for their return to the
reservation. On the, 25th of November
Captain Jack and his Indians refused to
go on the leservation, and on the 29th of
the same month United States troops,
under command of Captain Jackson,

CRITICIZE
WAR TAXES
The Measure Declared
Unjustly Drawn,
BULK DEALERS NOT HIT
THE BOTTLING HOUSES ARE
GIVEN THE BURDENS.
French Beciprocity Strikes a Severe
Blow at the Brandy Industry.
Sweet Wine Makers to
Suffer.
The wine men of California, particular
ly those dealing largely in case goods, the
distillers of brandy and the producers and
handlers of sweet wines, are much de
pressed over the action of the Govern
ment with reference to the recent signing
of the reciprocity treaty with France and
the passage of the war revenue bill by the
Senate yesterday, practically making It a
law. In the 'atter measure wines, dry or
sparkling, are taxed one cent for each
pint and two cents for quart bottles when
sold. This adds a tax of 24 cents a case,
or at the rate of ten cents per gallon. In
discussing the situation they call atten
tion to the fact that wine from first hands
Is selling as low as 8 cents per gallon In
California, and if such wines were bottled
the tax would be greater than the value
of the goods. One and all declare that
they are not unpatriotic and are willing
to bear their share of the expenses of the
war, but they attempt to show that the
tax collected will not be sufficient to pay
the expenses of the Government and will
result only in making positions for a lot
of internal revenue collectors. It was,
they think, the idea of those who drew
the bill that it would add quite a sum to
the national fund. However, they main
tain that this was a mistake, as will be
Been by the fact that not only in San
Francisco, but in the large eastern cen
ters of population, the bulk of the wine
drunk is sold to consumers in demijohns
or small kegs. All this wine escapes the
tax. For this reason the dealers who
handle goods in bulk only can laugh at
their competitors in the case-wine branch
of trade. This feature of the law is what
is causing resentment among the latter
class.
They assert that if the Government had
understood the situation and felt the ne
cessity of imposing a tax, it should have
been placed upon the original product in
uuik in cellars, thereby simplifying the
work of collection and returning a profit.
On the other hand the industry is in no
condition to bear a further burden, owing
to low prices and a decreased demand.
Some of the members of the trade fear
that the tax will result not only in further
reducing the prices of wine, but in
curtailing the consumption. So far
as the tax is concerned it will certainly be
added to the former selling figures and
the consumer will "pay the fiddler."
Still the trouble of stamping each bot
tle and keeping the records for the rev
enue officers will add a great deal of cost
and expense to the bottler. One of the
queries is made why the Government
should make such a distinction between
bottlers of beer and bottlers of wine. In
the case of the brewers, they pay a flat
tajc of $2 per barrel, which covers their
industry, but the bottlers of beer, who
are not brewers, yet make their profits
from selling- beer in bottles, are not called
upon to contribute to the war fund. The
answer of the brewers is that this would
be double taxation and unconstitutional.
Hov,r-ver, any way they may view the
situation, the dealers feel that they have
been discriminated against.
In speaking of the tax the head of the
leading firm dealing in case goods ex
clusively said:
"I consider the action of Congress an
injustice, but do not intend to intimate
that it was intentional. It is a plain dis
crimination which strikes the minor deal
ers and bottlers, while the large houses
who handle only bulk goods are not re
quired to contribute one cent to the Gov
ernment. When you consider that there
are firms in this city who sell from 3 000 -
000 to 4,000,000 gallons of wine per year,
it is not hard to see where the imposition
comes in.
"The Government will get the worst of
the proposition in the long run, as thÂ»
effect will be to drive the sale of cheaper
wines into the demijohn and keg trade
all of which will react against legitimate
"bottlers. Again, the restaurants will hail
the tax as a good thing, as they need
only to serve their wines in decanters
or half bottles to defeat the law.
"One branch of the business that will get
a very black eye Js that which sells wine
in bottles to local family and grocery
customers, etc.. In baskets. They will
be compelled to stamp each bottle and
as they work on a very small margin
they will have plenty of trouble. Still
they can also beat the law by delivering
the wine in bulk and bottling it at the
place of the purchaser. If the law-mak
ers had provided for a flat tax of 2 or 5
cents per gallon on bulk wines they would
have covered the whole field and realized
a few thousand dollars profit on the prop
osition. As it is there may be a balance
on the wrong side of the ledger. One
thing that can be looked for Is a large
increase in the Internal revenue force of
collectors. We will ad.vance the price
of our goods and do the be^Â£ we can.
"If the proper representations had been
made to the committee in Congress that
clause of the bill would never have car
ried, but it was neglected by those whose
duty It was to attend to the matter, and
the result Is a severe blow to the bot
tling branch of the trade. The industry
is In a miserable condition now, and while
we will gladly pay our just proportion
of taxation as loyal Americans, we feel
that the action of the Government is a
blunder and will result in no benefit to
any one. Of course the measure was
rushed through and the result will show
that it was ignorantly drawn."
The reciprocity treaty with France
which reduces the customs duty on
French spirits from $1 80 per gallon to
$1 20 has alarmed the distillers of brandy
In California, as the law has evidently
come to stay. American distillers pay ,
$1 10 tax per gallon, but the cheap spirits
from France, made from beets and po
tatoes, can be placed on the markets of
the United States at prices to give the
importers the best of the business. When
taken in consideration with the well
known fact that foreign goods are al
most invariably given the preference, it
can bo seen that native distillers have
gome cause to fear the result to their de
pressed business.
With reference to the sweet wine mak
ers, they regard this reduction of duty as I
a deadly blow to their branch of the in- j
dustry. This comes from the fact that |
these cheap French spirits can be used j
In the Bophistification of sweet winea and I
the pure product, to a great extent, will j
be run out of the market.
Taken all around, the outlook for Cali
fornia's wine and brandy men Is con
sidered by them more gloomy than be
fore.

FAIR FLORA AT THE PARK,
Rare Plants iv Bloom in the City's Great Conservatory.
At the park conservatory two plants are in bloom which are attracting
many visitors. The snow plant, of which a description was given in yes
terday's Call, was the center of attraction, and although its petals were
half unfolded, the delicate red had turned to a darker hue on the edges, in
dicating that the flowers would not fully develop, and that the plant would
not survive this tropical heat long. The gardeners say it would be almost
impossible for it to live anywhere, except in the higher altitudes, and they
expect it will droop and die in a few days. The snow plant was brought
down from Shasta a few days ago by a gentleman who discovered it close
to the snow line. It is in a pot in the west wing of the conservatory and will
receive every care.
Another variety is the Peristera Elata, or Holy Ghost flower, a species
of orchid found in South America. Specimens of this flower have been in the
conservatory for several years, and their blossoming has always been
eagerly watched by floriculturists and botanists. The blossoms on this
stalk began to unfold Thursday and were fully blown yesterday. The
leaves are a creamy white, with several tiny blood-red spots in the center.
The Victoria Regia was set out last week and is expected to blossom
the latter part of July or early in August.

SHE HAD BEAUTY, HE WEALTH

Fidelia Casual and Augustin Blamire
Wed in Haste, but Think
There Will Be No Re
pentance.
The good fortune of capturing as a hus
band a handsome young: lawyer whose
wealth is supposed to be represented by
a large figure followed by four ciphers
seldom falls to the lot of a variety act
ress whose salary depends largely on the
number of bottles of liquid refreshment
she can sell to her chance admirers, but
such has been the case with Miss Fidelia
Casual, who was married Thursday
morning to Augustln Blamire.
The two young people met the evening
betore the marriage, enamored of each
other, and after securing the services of
a naviifter departed for the southern pan
of the fitate on their weddl:ig trip.
Mlpe Casual, a petite, auburn haired
soubiette, secured a position in a well
known uptown concert hall the first of
this week and considered herself l'ortu
! Nato, though how much so she little knew.
j For thiec nights she did a short turn the
: early part of the evening, and then oc
cupied her time by making horse'f agree
able to the numerous patrons of the place
, and luring them by her sweet smiles and
! pleasing ways to pay $3 for four bit wine,
i she receiving a certain per cent of the
i money thus obtained by the house. That
she must have been eminently successful
in securing the elusive uollar for herself
and employer is evident from the short
I time it took her to win Mr. Blamire.
The gentleman in question strolled into
the concert hall Wednesday evening in
company of a friend and sat down to en
' joy the entertainment offered without the
slightest inkling that he was to meet a
j lady who would entirely change his plans
I for the future. Vv hen Miss Casual ap
i peared on the stage in a sailor costume,
assumed with the intention of making
herself acceptable to the soldier boy fre
quenters of the place, the young lawyer
was much impressed by the beauty and
cleverness of the little soubrette and de-
I termined to meet her.
Through the connivance of a willing
| waiter Miss Casual and the interested
j lawyer found themselves together In a
1 closed box near the stage, and each with
out any intention of matrimony sought to
be agreeable to the other. Cupid must
have been somewhere in the vicinty with
his ready bow, and it didn't take him
long to plant one of his dangerous ar
rows deep in the hearts of the two un
suspecting victims. Two hours sufficed
for Cupid's shafts to get in their
work, and Miss Casual and Mr. Blamire
left the theater vowing eternal love to
each other. The license office not being
kept open as late as the concert hall
prevented a marriage that night, but
early the following morning it was vis
ited by Mr. Blamire, and shortly after
ward he and Miss Casual were made
husband and wife.
The first intimation the young lady's
employer had that one of his star act
resses had deserted him for another man
ager was Thursday evening, when he re
ceived a note from the lady, Informing
him that she would appear no longer,
and giving a slight hint of the reason.
The news spread rapidly among the at
taches of the theater, and now every girl
s envious of the good fortune of her
sister. Each is hopeful that what has
happened may happen again, and all are
now on the lookout for any luckless
stranger who may come within their

Not a few campers who expected to lo
cate themselves above the dam have been
turned off by the agents of the water
company. "We have no objection to
campers selecting sites below the dam,"
said Charles Webb Howard, president of
the Spring Valley Water Company, yes
terday, "but under no circumstances will
any of them be allowed to camp above
the dam. It is true that the company
has acquired considerable land in the
canyon above Niles," he concluded, "but
that is a matter in which the public has
no interest."

FALSE LABELING
TO BE STOPPED.
SUIT AGAINST LIQUOR FIRMS
BY THE GOVERNMENT.
They Shipped Poor Liquor Under
Srands and Marks Used on
Superior Goods.
On behalf of the Government United
States Attorney Foote and Assistant At
torney Knight filed yesterday in the Unit
ed States District Court a suit against the
firm of Cronan & Wissemann to recover
judgment for $500 fine for shipping gin
and bitters under false labels. The com
plaint charges that the marks, etc., on
the packages "were other than, and not
the true and proper name or brand known
to the trade as designating the kind and
quality of the contents of said box or
package, as none of said bottles at such
time contained the genuine Siegert's An
gostura Bitters nor Holland gin, as the
same were and are known to such trade "
A similar suit has been filed against tlie
firm of Henry Campe & Co., for selling to
a saloon in the city of Stockton liquor
purporting to be one-star Henneasy
cognac, but which was not the genuine
article.
Mr. Knight said that the cases would
test the right of liquor dealers to pass off
inferior goods under well-known brands
for the purpose of deceiving the retail
purchaser. The market Is flooded with
vile stuff bearing respectable brands and
purporting to have been produced in for
eign countries-, and a vigorous attempt
will be made to abate the evil. The suits
are brought under section 3449 of the Re
vised Statutes of the United States, which
reads as follows:
"Whenever any person ships, transports
or removes any spirituous or fermented
liquors or wines under any other than the
proper name or brand known to the trade
a3 designating the kind and quality of the
contents of the cask or package contain
ing the same, or causes such act to be
done, he shall forfeit said liquors or wines
and casks or packages, and be subject to
pay a fine of $500.^
The goods in controversy were being
shipped to a firm In Stockton.

Fortune's Wheel.
FROM RICHES TO POVERTY
IN SEARCH OP AN HEIR TO A
LARGE ESTATE.
She Was the "Beautiful Brunette of
Mystery" of the Old City
Prison â Borrowed of Jay
Gould.
The life of Mrs. L. L. Henvis, formerly
Mrs. Rene Woodward, seems to have
been laden with romance from the time
she was 16 years of age up to date. At
the age mentioned she was a half or
phan and possessed of property valued
at $80,000 in her own right, all located
in her native city of Minneapolis. It
was left by her mother to be held by
her father in trust until she became of
age, or was married, no matter when.
The mother had not been dead more than
six months, when Rene Woodward, a
member of one of Kentucky's best fam
ilies, passed through Minneapolis fresh
from the University of Michigan. He
stopped over with a friend, and there met
Miss Bartlett, for that was her maiden
name.
It was love at first sight, and they
were married two days later, the young
man bringing home a bride instead of a
sheepskin, greatly to the annoyance of
his parent.". The young wife grew angry
at her reception, and informed her hus
band of her independent fortune. Rene
was a horse fancier, and a "sporty boy"
who knew just what to do with inde
pendent fortunes. Good luck followed for
a couple of years, and he more than
doubled the riches of his wife by follow
ing the races. She became a gambler
with him, and they plunged together un
til they plunged through every cent, fin
ally waking up at the Hoffman House,
New York, penniless.
They were in a strange house and in
a strange city. Woodward wanted to sui
cide by the gas route.

hour, and If I do not return with money
we will pass out together."
In the appointed time by Woodward's
stop watch that had been held on so
many races that lost, she was back with
just $500 in nice new bills.
In answer to his question as to where
she got the money, she said: "I went
to the office of Jay Gould; gave htm a
song and dance, my promissory note;
andâ you see the rest."
They jumped out of New York in "Jig
time." as she expresses it, and came to
California, where Woodward got the
agency of a liquor house. Though get
ting a good salary, his habits caused him
to become an embezzler, and in less than
twelve months he was behind in accounts
over $4000.
Just eight years ago he was arrested
at the Gallndo Hotel, Oakland, and lodged
at the old City Prison in this city. Dur
ing the many months of his incarceration
the youthful wife was his constant com
panion.
In fact, her attention was so constant
that Captain Stone of the prison saw fit
t6 interpose, but Chief Crowley overruled
him, and, locating at a neighboring hotel,
she kept constant vigilance over her im
prisoned husband, becoming- known as
"the beautiful brunette of mystery." be
cause she was never known to speak to
any one save the man who handled the
keys at the prison door.
Rene was convicted finally of forging

DECISIONS ON
INTERNAL REVENUE.
VINEYARDISTS MAY MAKE
WINE WITHOUT TAX.
A Woman's Husband May Sell
Liquor Under the License Is
sued to His Wife.
Internal Revenue Collector Lynch has
been notified of the following decisions
of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue:
Where grapes are pressed at one place
and the juice is then carried to another
place and there fermented, the latter is
the place of manufacture of the wine, and
the manufacturer is there permitted by
the provisions of section 3246 Revised Stat
utes to sell It without paying special tax.
A special stamp tax taken by a woman
as a retail liquor dealer in her own name
is sufficient for the same business con
ducted by her husband who takes charge
of it upon her retirement therefrom. He
is not required to pay special tax and
take out a stamp in his own name because
of the fact that a town license was re
fused to her but issued to him.
The fact that a person is an authorized
liquor dealer under the internal revenue
laws does not prevent him from engaging
also in the compounding of medicines; and
if he does so, using spirits in combination
with roots, hiÂ»rbs or drugs, and sells the
compound only under a label specifying
the diseases for which it is held out as a
remedy, he is an apothecary within the
exempting provision of section 3.M6, Ke

BARKER AFTER
BRITISH GOLD
An Oaklander Claims an
English Estate.
TO MAKE A STRONG FIGHT.
ATTOBNEY RANDOLPH WILL
GO TO LONDON.
Nearly Fifty Millions Are Said to
Be at Stake in the Contest
That Will Shortly
Begin.
Attorney J. B. Randolph of Oakland
will start for London In a few days for
the purpose of appearing before British
chancery courts to lay claim to several
estates aggregating many millions.
The claimants to the sums that have
long lain awaiting their owners do not
all live at Oakland, though several of the
heirs are residents of Alameda County.
"One of the most important claims un
der way,", said Mr. Randolph yesterday,
"is that of William F. Barker, who is a
nephew of the late Sir John T. Barker of
Belfast, who committed suicide some
years ago. The old man married the
Countess of Melrose, and part of the
property in question will be Melrose cas
tle.
"One of the claimants was George T.
Barker, a cousin of my client. George
recently died in the Missouri penitentiary,
where he was serving a life term for
shooting a man whom he found in com
pany with his fiancee. Now that he is
dead my client is the chief American
claimant, and I have letters from eminent
legal sources in London that give me
confidence that we will have little trouble
In winning the case."
It appears that about all that is neces
sary to settle the case in favor of the
Oakland claimant, according to advices
received from London, is proof of the
claimant's birth and a due certificate of
his mother's marriage. Sir William
Humphreys, a well known London bar
rister, has had charge of the affairs of
the claimant in England. He awaits the
arrival of Attorney Randolph, who ex
pects to reach London in a few weeks
with proofs that will make the case
smooth sailing. The genealogical proofs
of the case run back as far as 1613, and
the Oakland claimant says he has a com
plete copy of the family records in a
safe deposit bank in this city.
Mr. Barker thinks the value of the
estate is not far from fifty millions. He
says he has every assurance *>f winning
the entire amount. As he is a great
spiritualist, he says he will spend millions
in erecting a spiritualist temple in Los
Angeles if he is fortunate enough to suc
ceed in the litigation that is now taking
Attorney Randolph to London.
CANTON CERTIFICATES.
Their Validity Will Be Determined
by a Test Case Begun Yesterday
in the District Court.
Sixty-one Chinese arrived on the Doric
recently with what are designated as No.
6 or Canton certificates, which state that
the person whose name and description It
bears is a merchant and entitled to land.
The exclusion act of ISB4 prescribes that
the certificate shall state, among other
things, the nature, character and esti
mated value of the bearer's business.
The treaty with China which was rati
fied in 1894 prescribes that the immigrant
must have a certificate, but does not re
quire the nature, character and estimated
value of the business to be stated. It is
contended by the Chinese that, the treaty
being of later birth than the statute, su
persedes It wherever the statute comes
in conflict with it and that therefore that
portion of the statute requiring the state
ment of the nature, character and esti
mated value of the business of the appli
cant need not be regarded as in effect; in
other words, that it has been repealed by
the provisions of the treaty.
In order to settle the matter, the Col
lector of the Port determined to make a
test case, and, in accordance with this
arrangement, one of the sixty-one immi
grants was allowed to land, and was im
mediately arrested on the ground that he
is illegally in the country. H6 will pre
sent his Canton certificate to United
States District Judge de Haven, and the
matter will be argued and submitted on
law points.
Aid Is Asked For.
The Salvation Army, at Its supply
store, 162 New Montgomery street, has
been furnishing, two days every week,
during the past year, food and clothing
to between fifty and a hundred families.
The provision is now gone, and its shelves
are empty. Any person wishing to con
tribute either food, money or clothing by
notifying Ensign Campbell, at 1419 Mar
ket street. Salvation Army headquarters,
will be immediately waited "upon. Among
the number now being provided for are
families of soldiers who have gone to
Manila. Ensign Campbell says that the
need was never greater than at the pres
ent time, and the cast-off clothing can be
profitably used at the address here given.

MEN WHO ARE
EXPERT
WITH A RIFLE.
The second grand shooting festival of
the National Schuetzon-Bund of America,
â which will take place at the Glendale
Shooting Park, Long Island, from July 3
to July 11, is attracting more attention
among the local rifle men this year than
ever before. There are two reasons for
this. The first Is that many more of
California's sharpshooters are going East
to attend the festival than ever before,
and the second is that a strong effort
will be made to have the next Bund fes
tival held In this city. These gather-
Ings do not take place every year, but
every three years, and they are the occa
sion of drawing together all of the finest
riflemen of the United States and Europe.
It stands to reason, then, that the prizes
offered are large. In the coming event
over $25,000 Is offered in cash, besides in
numerable premiums, medals, cups and
other prizes. The association has a guar
anteed fund of J200.000.
The Bund does nothing by half. In the
coming festival there are seven or more
events and the cash prizes run from $2
to $500, to say nothing of the premiums,
etc. While the majority of the matches
are for the members of the clubs belong
ing to the Bund, still there are plenty of
matches where individual, unattached
riflemen can take part. Most of the mem
bers in the East are men or means, and
they take much pride in offering special
prizes of no small value. For example,
at the previous festivals pianos, sets of
household furniture, solid silver sets, pic
tures from the best artists, etc., have
been donated by the wealthy sportsmen.
Nearly all of the rifle clubs of the East
are members and a fair representation in
the Middle West. In this city only two
clubs belong to the associationâ the San
Francisco Schuetzen Verein and the Co
lumbia Pistol and Rifle Club.
When the last iestival was held the
Eastern members Intimated to their Pa
cific Coast brethren that an offer from
California would be seriously considered
for the present celebration. But there i
were many things to be considered and I
provided for, and the opportunity was |
passed with the understanding that the I
festival of 1901 should be held in this city.
Three years is none too long a time for
making necessary arrangements for such
an event. While the Bund puts up nearly
all of the cash prizes, still much is ex
pected of the community in which the I
festival takes place. Many special prizes ;
are expected and ample provision must :
be made for the entertainment of the vis- \
itore. It is generally understood that if -
the Bund does not meet in this city on i
t.ie next occasion it will go to the city
In Europe offering the best Inducement, j
Nearly all of the marksmen of the East
would prefer to come out to the Pacific
and see the beauties of California, and it
Is believed that the delegates from this !
city will not have very much trouble to j
induce the Bund to hold the next shoot
ing festival en one of our bay ranges.
The move to bring the Bund to this city
has already been made, the San Francisco !
Schuetzen Verein taking the initiative. A
week or po ago its executive committee !
cent out invitations to the president of
all of the other clubs to assemble and dis
cuss the question. The meeting was held :<
a few nights ago and the following rille
shooting organizations were represented: '
San Francisco Srhuetzen Veroin -D B 'â¢
Faktor, John Utschig. L. Ha&ke, Riohard
Heise and William EhrenDforr; Verein

O. Rodgers of the Columbia Pistol and
Rifle Club, which was holding it 3 regular ;
meeting that evening, was Instructed by j
the club to Indorse the movement. At '
the meeting of the several organization*'
representatives the matter was discussed
in all its lights, and the decision arrived
at was that every marksmen going to
the festival on Long Island in Juiy should
use every effort to have San Francisco
selected as the place for the next meet
ing of the Bund. If they are successful
this gathering will mean more to the peo
ple of California than the uninitiated can
comprehend with explanation. In the
East the majority of the riflemen are men
of unlimited means, and they number in
to the hundreds. It has been the efforts
of many of the larger improvement or
ganizations of this State to Induce peo-
Ele of resources to come to this State, the
elief being that once here the natural
advantages and beauties of the State will
Induce many to remain, or at least make
Investments on the Pacific Coast. Here,
then, is an opportunity not offered every
day. and the organizations which have
undertaken this move should have the
encouragement of the public-spirited citi
zens of the community. Many will be
surprised to know that !n this city and
around the bay are over 1500 riflemen,
while scattered over the State are almost
as many more. In Los Angeles, San Jose,
Stockton, Sacramento, Ukiah. Eureka.
Fresno, Arcata, lone and many other
places are large and small rifle and pis
tol clubs. Such an event as the local
riflemen are now trying to bring about
â¢would call in members of these organiza
tions by the hundreds.
There is still another element that must
be taken into considerationâ the riflemen
of Europe. At every one of these big
shooting festivals the crark shots from
the larger cities of England and the Con
tlnent can be found, putting forth their
be9t efforts to best the marksmen of
the Western continent. Money or prize
with them is not so much the object as
the honor of superior marksmanship The
shooters of the Pacific Coast feel that
they are able to hold their own with the
best Bhots in the world, and from the
sentiment displayed at the meeting of the
representatives of the clubs there is also
a feeling that they can make the visitors
from the East and across the sea believe
that Callfornians are the most hospitable
people on top of the earth.

SCRAPS OF NEWS
FROM THE KENNELS.
Two of the most important specialty
clubs of the ooast are scheduled to hold
their monthly meeting to-night.
The Pacific Mastiff Club will probably
elect a delegate to the American Kennel
Club to succeed Erastus Hamilton, who
has, by reason of his non-attendance at
the American Kennel Club meetings, be
come persona non grata to the club he
represents. It Is understood that Dr. C.
A. Longest of Boston, the great mastiff !
breeder, has boen aptly selected as the I
best fitted to represent the local club
The Pacific Fox Terrier Club has a i
mass of accumulated business to digest !
but in view of the fact that Its officers j
have been much occupied with bench I
enow affairs, it is quite likely that the
meeting will be postponed until next Sat- i
urday. Some unnecessary excitement has I
been aroused by the comments made by
some alleged sporting scribes on the i
charges made by Colonel C. B. Knocker I
against the Pacific advisory board These I
comments display a total ignorance of
kennel matters on the coast, and more
particularly of the workings of the Amer
ican Kennel Club. The facts of the case
are these: The Pacific advisory board
as at present constituted, contains a
number of discordant elements, all at
cross purposes, and consequently tends to
promote discord, instead of harmony
among the Pacific specialty and kennel
clubs. Colonel Knocker, who is acting
under instructions from the San Fran
cisco Kennel Club, of which he is the
delegate, proposes to reform the preseTrt
advisory board out of existence. The
next thing in order will then be the ap
pointment by the American Kennel Club
of such delegates from the coast clubs
as will constitute a harmonious body
to regulate local kennel affairs. Every
fancier, who has the interests of the dog
truly at heart, must wish that the colonel
will be successful in his cfTort.
Emmet Sullivan of Menlo Park has
given notice to the American Kennel Club
that the name of his newly acquired fox
terrier. Elwood Check, has been changed
to Menlo Check. Mr. Sullivan claims
registration under the new title. Check
has arrived in fine fettle and looks every
inch the dog he has been "cracked up"
to be.
Fox terriers are certainly on the move
At least three Eastern cracks are on the
way, or soon will be, to the Golden Gate.
Eugene O'Neill of Belmont intends to
break up his kennel of Irish setters, which
will be sold.
H. H. Carlton, the secretary of the San
Francisco Kennel Club, is now paying
the prize money to the successful ex
hibitors, and announces that the medals
will be ready for distribution in the early
part of next week.
FIELD OF SPORT
STANDAM) AMEfcICAN TAR6ET
WELTER-WEIGHTS
READY
FOR THE FRAY.
Young McConnell of the San Francisco
â  Athletic Club, who is a protege of Alex
Greggains, the clever exponent of flstl
â  cuffs, is increasing- daily his number of
â  admirers and followers.
McConnell, as every sport lover knows,
is matched to fight the clever McKeever
: before the National Club on the evening
lof Tuesday, June 21. Owing to the years
of hard experience which McKeever has
i had while battling for coin and glory, it
is presumed that he will be a strong fa
\ vorite among the bettors who invariably
play the old dog for the hard road, but
as a general thing a lii}>? cannot be drawn
on the lighters because one man may be
sent well to the front by those who make
: the betting figures in the pool rooms.
Many instances may be cited which will
' prove that the favorites in gambling cir
cles have frequently been the recipients
of a good listing and beating in the ring.
But be that as It may, it can be taken for
granted, however, that Young McConnell
will give his friends and admirers "a run
for their money." and who can say that
McKeever has any particular cinch on the
game?
The Slatlngton lad. although a polished
mechanic pugillstically, Is not a very dan
gerous chap; in fact, he has but two

knockouts to his credit and the men who
fell before him are Horace Leeds and Ar
thur Valentine. In July, Wi. Ziegler
knocked McKeever out In three rounds,
but In 1896 McKeever won from Zifgler
In a six-round bout; In the subsequent
year they met twice and fought six
rounds each time without a decision.
Ziegler is, however, a most tricky fel
low, who cannot be depended upon. He
did not leave a good impression on the
sporting fraternity of this city.
McKeever met the erratic Griffo twice.
In April, 1596, he fought the Australian
twenty rounds, the contest being declared
Jn his favor, and on September 7, 1897.
they fought fifteen rounds at Athens, Pa.,
which bout was declared a draw.
McConnell met Griffo in the Olympic
Club of this city and the large number of
people who witnessed the contest spoke
very highly of the local boxer, whose de
fense was particularly clever. It is said,
however, that Griffo did not extend him
self on this occasion and good Judges did
not hesitate to say after the mill that
Griffo fought to lose by a email margin,
as he had an object in view.
Be that as it may, McConnell proved
beyond argument that he is made of the
right stuff, and should give a very' good
account of himself in the best of com
pany. The Ran Franciscan is training
at Blankcn's Six Mile House, under the
care of Greiegains, and his opponent is
located at the Ocean Beach. The pre
liminary to this fight will consist of a
ten-round contest between Young Peter
Jackson (colored) and Frank Purcell. In
case a decision cannot be rendered at the
end of the tenth round the pugilists must
fight on until an award can be given.
Amateur boxing clubs will do well to
remember in future that the police ser
geants who will be detailed to look after
fistic entertainments will Insist upon pad
ding being placed under the hard ring
floors, that are now covered only by a
thin carpet. A hint to the wise should
be sufficient.
The Manhattan Athletic Association has
completed arrangements for a boxing car
nival to be held at Elntracht Hall on
Thursday evening, June 30. The pro
gramme, as follows, Is to decide the light
and bantam championships of the Pacific
Coast:
Jimmy Anthony vs. Fred Renick, fif
teen rounds: Bud Terry vs. Kid McFad
den, six rounds; Lon Agnew vs. Fred
Muller, fifteen rounds.
The Alpine Athletic Club of 28 Golden
Gate avenue will give Its monthly exhi
bition on Tuesday evening next. The prin
cipal event Will be an eight-round con
test for a valuable club trophy between
Pat Lynch of the Excelsior Club and
Joe Kane of the Alpine Clubâ
14f) pounds. Also a six-round bout be
tween D. A. Carroll of the California
Swimmingand Athletic Club and E Dahl
"The Butcher Boy"â 130 pounds.
The Excelsior Athletic Club will hold
its next regular monthly exhibition' on
Monday, June 20. at Teutonia Hall 1322
Howard street. The principal events
will be eight-round boxing contests be
tween Jimmy Riley of the Excelsior Club
and Charley Reno of the Olympic Club
at 12S pounds, for the lightweight ama
teur championship of the Pacltic Coast
and a valuable trophy. Also an eight
round boxing contest between Charley
Tye of the Reliance Athletic Club and
Jack Lahey of the Manhattan Athletic
Club, at 140 pounds, for the welter-weight
amateur championship of th.9 Pacific
Coast and a valuable trophy.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JUNE 11, 1398.
YACHTS CRUISE
ON RIVER,
BAY AND OCEAN.
W. S. Goodfellow's schooner La Paloma
of the Pacific and San Francisco clubs
has left her moorings near the house of
the latter and gone on a long cruise in
southern waters. E. A. Wiltsee's schooner
Aggie sailed in "the channel" last Satur
day. The Pacific programme has a cruise
to Quarry Cove set down for to-day, and
a cruise in squadron under signal from
the flagship for to-morrow.
When Dr. T. L. Hill accepted the office
of commodore of the San Francisco Â«Yacht
Club for IS9B the support of the officers
and members was cordially promised to
him. The commodore set down upon his
programme few cruises, but hoped that
these would be well attended. For June
4 a cruise to McNear's Landing with a
dance in the pavilion there was appointed.
The afternoon and evening were glorious;
a full moon shed her. brightness, and the
air was warm and summerlike. Yet, not
withstanding these favorable conditions,
not a single yacht followed the flagship
Cygmis from Sausalito. The vice-com
modore went off to a dinner, the secretary
and treasurer to a cricket match and the
rest of the officials, who at a dinner on
the previous evening had enthusiastically
drunk the commodore's health, were con
spicuous by their absence. Though the
San Francisco Club has a goodly number
of yachts on its roll and plenty of good
fellows among its officers and members. It
unfortunately has very little club spirit.
Though the wind was light last Satur
day evening, the flagship Cygnus keeping
to the El Campo shore, got up to McNears
and cast anchor in the little cove near the
pavilion at about 10 p. m. F. A. Bartlett's
sloop Queen, just returned from a two
weeks' cruise up the river, was lying at
anchor there, The pavilion was lighted
up, and the guests were made at home by
Mr. and Mrs. George McNear. Soon Allen
M. Clay's Sea Fox of the California Yacht
Club came In, and later A. Sutherland's
Catherine of the San Francisco Yacht
Club and the sloop Cupid of the Corin
thian Yacht Club. After a few dances, G.
McNear kindly took several of the visit
ors out for a trial in his launch. On their
return a little supper was served.
On board the sloop Cygnus were Com
modore Dr. T. 1,. Hill and Mrs. Hill, Mr.
and Mrs. W, J. Monro, Miss Kate Kerri
gan, C. Rieveley and Arthur Inkersle-y.
There being no wind at all on Sunday
morning, the party rambled ashore to the
Chinese shrimp-fishers' village. At about
1:30 p. m. Allen M. Clay's Sea Fox, which
had made an unsuccessful attempt to get
out the night before, sailed away, fol
lowed by A. Sutherland's Catherine and
the sloop Cupid. F. A. Bartlett's Queen
and Dr. T. L. Hill's Cygnus were last to
leave. Near Quarry Cove, Angel Island,
G. B. Edgar's sloop Sappho and G. P.
Gaither's sloop U & I were met and sa
luted. To-day and to-morrow are open
days upon the programme of the San
Franclscos. The next cruise Is to Marin
Islands, on the 18th and 19th.
Arthur D. Naylor's sloop Twilight, af
ter being painted, scraped and generally
overhauled, came off the "ways" at
Menottl's last week, and took her first
cruise on Sunday. She Is a beamy craft,
about thirty-five feet over all, of light
draught, and very strongly built; an ex
cellent boat for general cruising, and
work in creeks. Yesterday her owner,
accompanied by G. T. S. White, vice
commodore of the San Franciscos, and
one or two friends, left Sausallto for a
nine days' cruise; they propose to go first
to Mare Island, thence up the Napa
Creek to Napa City- down the creek and
up the Sacramento River.
Frank A. and Mrs. Bartlett had a de
lightful two weeks' cruise in the sloop
Queen spending three or four days at
Suisun, getting up to Courtland on the
Sacramento River, and enjoying some
fins sailing through the sloughs. Mc-
Nenrs Landing was reached on Friday,
the 3d, and on Sunday the Queen returned
to her moorings at Sausalito.
The Corinthians had a cruise to the
Petaluma drawbridge set down for last
Saturday and Sunday. Commodore Carl
Westerfeld's sloop Aeolus, W. S. Grover's
yawl Arcturus, F. F. Ames' sloop Elia,
ex-Commdore A. J. Young's Clara, J. M.
Patrick's sloop Thetis, Secretary E. B.
Lathrop's sloop Pride, J. M. Matoon's
sloop Amigo, the sloop Mignon, ex-Corn*
modore J. W. Pew's sloop Truant, F. R.
Cook's sloop Harpoon, and A. J. Lyons'
sloop Freda started from Tiburon, but
the breeze along the Contra Costa shore
was so light that only the flagship Aeolus
carried it through and reached her des
tination. Elia, Harpoon and Thetis an
chored about two miles below the bridge,
while Truant, Mignon, Arcturus, Pride and
Amigo came to anchor at McNears Land
ing. Clara sailed around all night. Aeolus
COLUMBIAN TA&6E.T
left soon after 1 p. m. on Sunday on the
return trip, and had a good breeze down.
E. Sager is having the injuries done to
Edna by the collision with Pride re
paired; the damage is not serious. Pride
had the crew of Edna on board last Sat
urday and Sunday; she reached McNears
about 11 p. m. on' Saturday, but, tempted
by the warmth and brilliancy of the
night, sailed up and down until nearly 3
in the morning. Edna will be ready to
resume sailing to-day.
E. B. Learning, once commodore of the
Tacoma Yacht Club, and owner of an
undefeated boat, has been elected a mem
ber of the Corinthian Yacht Club. He
may have his boat brought down from
the Sound, but, if he does not do this,
will build a yacht.
To encourage yachting and yacht rac
ing the Encinal Yacht Club offers an
nually challenge pennants in each class.
The winner of a pennant may hold it for
two weeks unchallenged; then any boat
in the winner's class may challenge for
it. and the race between challenger and
challenged takes place not earlier than
seven days, nor later than fourteen days,
from the day of the challenge. All boats
In the winner's class may enter. The
boats in the club fleet are classed as A,
Al, 1, 2, 3 and 4. The yachts winning
the largest number of challenge races
during the season receive prizes. If two
boats win the same number of pennant
races, the tie is raced off. The annual
regatta of the Encinals for challenge
pennants Is set down for this afternoon,
but no entries having been received, there
will be no race.
The yawl Phyllis and the sloops Fawn
and Iris, of the Encinal Yacht Club, are
at San Mateo. S. E. Bates' Vlx<*n is go
ing for a cruise up the Sacramento River
this month, and on Saturday. June 18,
Commodore J. S. Hanleys yawl Spray,
flagship of the Encinal fleet, will take
a party up to Mare Island, and for an
up-river cruise.
ALL ABOUT PISH ,
AND TROUT STREAMS.
Fly fishing: on the McCloud River is
about over, as the salmon have entered
the stream and that means only bottom
fishing for trout until next September.
Tom Flynn and other anglers, who are
fond of heavy-weight sport, will try their
luck this month on the McCloud at sal
mon fishing. The salmon will take a !
spoon or a large, gaudy fly and battles I
of an hour and more are common; fre
quently the king of the river cleans the
angler out of all line and tackle.
Fish Commissioner Vogelsang states
that the Paper Mill, or, rather, the head
waters of Lagunitas Creek, will posi
tively be stocked with thousands of trout
fry before the end of July. Anglers ap
preciate anything that the Commission
ers will do looking to their future pleas
ure.
11 v.^ 1 , 1 ? ot be la -w*ul for anglers to
catch black bass until July 1. The out
look is very good for early fishing on
Russian River.
\V. Bogard visited the Truckee River
last Sunday and reports having had first- j
class sport spooning for trout near Verdi, i
Although it is a little early for good fly
flshing on TrurUee the salmon and red
ant flies are becoming plentiful, and that
is a sign of excellent fly fishing near at
hand. Mr. Bogard reports that market
fishermen have been shipping large quan- I
titles of trout from Verdi. Florriston and !
Reno to this city and Sacramento since
April.
Ed Kolb, the ex-champion wrestler and
all round good fellow, is at present camp- !
ed on the banks of the Klamath River,
near Shovel Creek. Eddie is having the |
highest of old times among the piscatorial
beauties of Southern Oregon, and as an
evidence of what he can catch on the i
fly a beautiful mess of large rainbows j
arrived in this city last Tuesday, con- j
signed to Commodore Den-Hard. When j
the nautical observer opened the cage I
in which the beauties were lying in wait I
for the pan he found them so strong that !
they leaped out of his hand on sight.
The warm weather had, doubtless, much j
to do with the condition of the fish en i
route to this city. Den-Hard has shipped
the all round good fellow a box of what '
is commonly called fish preservative, and i
the next shipment from Klamath is
watched for with much interest by friend- |
ly epicures.
Refused to Prosecute.
The cases of John Joseph Sehl of Se
attle and Charles Hammersmith, charged
with shooting at each other in the lodg
ing-house, 242 Post street, kept by Sehl"s
wife, last Monday, were again called in
Judge Mogan's court yesterday and each
refused to swear to a complaint against
the other, and asked that the cases be
dismissed. Judge Mogan declined to ac
cede to the request and Instructed Detec
tive Egan to swear to both complaints.
The cases were then continued till Mon
day.
GERMAN 25 RING TAPC6ET
REUNION AND
REGATTA
AT LONG BRIDGE.
Twenty-five or more years ago Long
Bridge was a favorite resort of the in
habitants of San Francisco for purposes
of bathing, yachting and rowing. The
first yachts seen on the bay were an
chored off Long Bridge, and near it were
cafes, refreshment houses and saltwater j
baths. The first yacht races were held,
and in 1868 the first attempt was made j
to organize a yacht club, and provide it
with quarters at Long Bridge. Though
the yachtsmen have deserted the old
Bridge for about a quarter of a century
in. favor of the more attractive shores of
Marln County, Long Bridge has always ;
remained an important rendezvous of the â 
oarsmen and scullers. But it is now j
about to follow other old landmarks of
the city into oblivion. Before the fa
miliar object disappears a general reun
ion of the boating clubs on the bay will
be held there to-morrow. The Pioneers,
Ariels and South Ends will throw their
quarters open to the rowing men; the
Dolphin Boat Club will send over several
crews, and the Tritons, who rarely make
public appearances, will row over to do
honors to the occasion. The morning
will be devoted to a reception for lad
ies; then will follow the Ariel Rowing
Club regatta, after which the members
and visitors will repair to the South End
boathouse for music and refreshments.
The Olympic minstrels have promised
their services, and other talented per
formers will entertain the company. The
president of the day will be D. J. Shee
han. Invitations have been issued to
all the other boat clubs and the inten
tion is to make the gathering a notable
and interesting one.
The programme of races Is as follows:
1. Senior skiff raceâ Frank Wilson vs.
Robert Ellis and James Wilson vs. G. W.
Phelan.
2. Junior skiff race â James O'Connell,
E. Sternberg and Charles McCoy.
3. Junior four-oared barge race â First
crew: Edward Lynch, stroke; F. Loth,
afterwaist; A. Haughton, forwardwaist;
E. McDonough, bow. Second erew â E.
Chapelle, stroke; Andrew Carroll, after
waist; P. H. Wilson, forwardwaist; Al
bert Carroll, bow.
4. Old timers' raceâ Leander Stevenson,
Eugene Flanders, William Growney, John
T. Sullivan of the Pioneer Boat Club, Tom
Flynn, Dan Leahy and William Thornton
of the South End Rowing Club.
6. Exhibition sculling match between
William McAusland and Henry Wittkoff.
G. Match race in four-oared barges be
tween the Ariel Senior crew and the
members of the Turnverein composing
one of the Ariel Junior crews. The chal
lenging Junior crew is made up of Charles
Haas, stroke; William Hausteln, after
waist; William Oechsle, forwardwaist;
and E % Steffern, bow. The Senior chal
lenged crew is made up of William Howe,
stroke; Edward McKenna. afterwaist;
Robert Ellis, forwardwaist; and John
Fickert, bow.
The officers of the regatta are: Referee,
3. C. McGinnis; starter, P. J. Enright;
;lmers, Walter Blake and John O'Connell;
judgesâ J. D. Batteaux, L. Waterman, H.
A. Pless, Johnson Hardy and H. Cav
?ney; marshal of course, J. R. Bockman.
To-morrow the South End men will join
the Ariels and the Pioneers In receiving
:he visiting oarsmen. The South End boat
:iouse, being more commodious than that
af the Ariels, will be used for refresh
ments and for the high jinks that will
follow the regatta.
Blank forms for entries at the El Campo
regatta have i>een sent out, and must be
returned, properly filled out. six days be
fore June 26, to S. J. Pembroke, the sec
retary of the regatta committee of the
Pacific Athletic Association.
F. W. Ayers and Chetwood Avers, the
winners of the gold and silver medals for
3enlor scullers, will enter the senior shell
â¢ace at El Campo.
The election of officers of the Triton
Swimming and Boating Club was held on
Puesday, June 7, and the following were
;hosen: President. D. H. Everett; finan
cial secretary, I. Citron; recording eecre
ary, George Blum; treasurer, August F.
Schuppert; captain. John Peat; lieutenant,
}us Schimpf; trusteesâ D. J. O'Keefe, H.
Srickwedel and B. H. Coffin.
Divorce Suits Filed.
Lulu Gossard has filed a suit for divorce
against her husband, Frank W. Gossard.
As a cause of action the plaintiff alleges
desertion. Mabel L. Kimball has applied
for a divorce from John Kimball on the
ground that the defendant deserted her
over a year ago.
WITH THE HOUNDS
AND THE
COURSING MEN.
Three big stakes will be run off to-day
ana to-morrow at the two parks. At In
gleslde the feature is an all age, open
event. At Union Park an open event and
a sapling stake are scheduled. The en
try at Union Park Is of execeptlonally
high quality. The sport should be corre
spondingly warm. Picking the final win
ner in the long odds books will tax the
shrewdest expert.
Last week was the first occasion In
many months that Jim Byrnes' name
failed to appear on the card at Ingle
side. Jim was just ten minutes late and
the entries had closed without him.
Dean has Moondyne and Mialmo at
Union Park to-day for a change. The
pair should be well up In front, especial
ly Moondyne.
The wet weather has put the coursing
fields in velvet-like condition.
The Sapling stake at Union Park to
day includes a pair of youngsters owned
by Cronin and McDonald that appear
able to make a good start. They are by
Skyball, out of Arnette, and are a splen
did looking brace of fledglings.
Dave Winders made another effort to
purchase Jimmy Anthony's Statesman at
Ingleside last Sunday. Jimmy, however,
was obdurate.
The Call picked every winning pnppy at
Ingleside la.st Saturday and in the open
stake lost only one of twenty-six courses.
The Call's tips are consequently gaining
popularity.
Mialmo and Blackette meet at Uuion
Park to-day for the third time. Twice
Mialmo has won. To-day it looks like
the Curtis dog, but as neither is believed
to be In the acme of shape the result is
shrouded in much uncertainty.
Joe South has at his resort near In
gleside a greyhound for which he would
like to find an owner. It Is a female,
white, apparently about four years old,
and strayed into Joe's place several days
ago.
Kay and Frank are bidding for the
stake at both parks to-day. At Ingle
side Diana has been doing some lively
running of late. At Union Park Leono
ra's work has been fair, but on neither
sward has she shown the form which
marked her performances of a year ago.
O'Connell Bros, have a line out for the
Ingleside coin to-day. Log Boy was
scarcely at his best last week, but is said
to have recovered. Senorita has been
showing steady improvement for some
time.
Judging by their past performances the
courses in the first run-down at Union
Park to-day should result as follows:
White Chief to beat ; Hicks; Lissak to
beat Connolly; Border's Valentine to beat
Lady Grace; Forget to beat Gilt Edge-
Theron to bet Sweet Lips; Sunbeam to
bet Glenwood ; . Royal Buck to beat â¢ Lady

PICNIC RUNS ARE
NOW THE
CYCLERS' PASTIME
The Acme Club Wheelmen of Oakland
and the Bay City Wheelmen of this city
will have their annual picnic run to-mor
row to a sequestered nook across the bay.
The Bay Citys will take the 9 a. m. creek
route boat and meet the Oakland club at
the foot of Broadway. There will be a
bountiful repast and numerous games to
while the time away.
The Olympic Club Wheelmen, under
Captain W. L. Loos, will tour Maria
County on Sunday, the 19th, their destin
ation being Tocaloma.
The Olympic Cyclers will hold a pic
nic run to Escalles, Marin County, o a
Sunday, the 19th inst., and Captain Shea
expects a large attendance.
Among the Denver, Minnesota and
other Eastern States troops now quar
tered here are a number of very speedy
cyclers who have hastened to avail them
selves of their favorite sport by patron
izing the park cycleries whenever leave
of absence was obtainable. The local
riders have picked up these soldier-cy
clers as "good things" in a racing -
wherein they have been badly fooled, as
many a soldier has shown them his rear
wheel in a brush on the cycle path.
The Bay City Wheelmen will hold thr-lr
annual picnic run, heretofore held at
Blythedale, at Millwood, Marin County,
on Sunday, June 19. All ex-members are
invited and are requested to notify
tain Harry Larkin, 441 Golden <JatP ave
nue, not later than next Wednesday, if
they will attend. Members will sign
the list on the club bulletin board The
wheeling contingent will take the 9:30
a. m. Tiburon boat and ride via Belve
dere and Alto to destination. Those who
go without their cycles will take the 10
a. m. Sausalito boat and Mill Valley train
to Millwood. There will be a baseball
game and numerous other sports.
The Bay City Wheelmen will take a
trip to Stockton on Saturday afternoon,
June 2b, on the river steamer, returning
Monday morning. The club's baseball
team will go up to play a match ga,mÂ«
with the Stockton Wheelmen.
General satisfaction is expressed at thÂ«
change of date of the annual C. A. C. C.
20-mile race, as suggested by The Call,
from July to the latter part of Septem-
I ber, when it is cooler for such a long and
hard race and more men are in training.
i The associations events are now well
' distributedâ the 25-mile handicap coming
â¢ !n February, the 100-mile relay race in
May, the 20-mile scratch in September
' and" the 10-mile handicap in October.
The prospects are good for a big In
door tournament at the Pavilion next
1 winter, managed by the American Cycle
1 Racing Association. Alf Ellinghouse,
well-known in theatrical circles here, is
the local representative of Messrs. Pow
ers and Brady, who control the associa
tion, and he "states in a letter to The
Call from New York, dated May 30, that
it is the intention to bring out Jame3
Michael, Fred Titus. â¢'Major" Taylor
(colored). Edouard Taylore (French), and
a number of other stars. The meet will
probably be held in January.
Arthur M. Boyden, of the Reliance Club
Wheelmen, Oakland, one of the most
popular professionals on the State cir
cuit, died at his home across the bay
last Wednesday. Boyden was one of the
best handicap riders in the State, and
had a large circle of friends, both in and
outside of the sport. His malady was
typhoid fever, and his illness of short
duration.
Frank E. Richardson, who was captain
of the Bay City Wheelmen ten years
ago, and has been living in Southern.
California for several years past, is again
in the city, this time to stay, and 13
renewing "his old acquaintances among
the wheelmen.
The Imperial Cycling Club is now en
sconsed in its new home at 308 Baker
street, near Fell. The club will have a
yachting cruise on Sunday, June 19.
The Capital City Wheelmen of Sacra
mento have arranged their programme
of events for their annual meet on July
4. The gathering will commence Satur
day evening, July 2, with the regular
monthly meeting of the board of officers
of the C. A. C. C, after which there
will be a hi^-h jinks and banquet in their
honor. Sunday following will be given
over to tours to various points of in
terest in the vicinity of Sacramento.
There will be a parade Monday morning
and the races will be held in the after
noon on the famous three-lap board
track. The events will Include a one
mile novice, the mile State championship,
one-half mile handicap, and a five-mile
paced match between J. E. Wing of the
Olympic Club and some rider not yet
selected. Efforts are being made to get
Furman of Los Angeles as his opponent.
The fifty-mile relay race between the
Olympic Club Wheelmen and the Capital
City Wheelmen will be held on Sunday,
August 7, on the Sacramento track, and
both clubs will stake their all on the reÂ«
suit, so hearty Is the rivalry.

Handsome Truck Egan will not be seen

gave It to him. Truck had an opportun

Coffroth was not overanxious to part
â with him, yet he deemed it expedient, ow

"Ham" lberg $50 for not appearing In Sac

advising his manager, simply took the
liberty of remaining at home. He was
fined for disappointing the fans, and the
league board should uphold Mr. Sweeney
In his action. This is not the first time

"Kid" Peoples is Just as fast as ever
and Is playing a great third for the lead
ers. The management would not part
with him for anything short of a Collins,
Wallace or McGraw. A glimpse at his
record in the field should be studied by
some of the lesser lights. Out of thirty
six chances he has successfully dallied
with thirty-two, which gives him a field
ing average of .889. Pretty good work
that. But Just look who he isâ a Gilt
Edger, one of the kind that practices
every day. V
Mertes Is playing great ball for Chi
cago. He not only pilfers a base with
the utmost regularity, but is hitting the
ball hard and in numerous instances safe.
His batting is most surprising, and may
It be of the perpetual order. â¢He has not
changed his ideas in regard to meeting
the ball, however, and I am afraid he
will realize the urgent necessity of do
ing so before many moons. "Everybody
to his style," may be Sam's motto, and
it might be that Sam could never refrain
from swinging at the ball, yet all the
greatest batsmen of the present decade
are 'snap hitters," and this fact demon
strates in an unmistakable manner the
advisability of adopting the rules now In
vogue, and employed by those men who
each year stand near the top of Na
tional League batting percentages. Ido
not wish to be misunderstood on this
batting proposition. When I advance the
opinion that snapping at the ball is the
correct way of handling a bat, I am
speaking to those players who are intent
on leading the league, if possible. In bat
ting. There are any number of play
ers who swing at the ball and meet it
very, very often. It is natural for them
to swing, and natural batters are desir
able, for it is out of this variety of men
that all ideal batsmen originate.
To be a first class batter one must pos
sess natural ability, but not to such an
extent that he is blind to all other ideas
concerning this art. When he has trained
his eye so as to he able to walk up to the
plate and pick out a pood ball he Is then
In one sense a great batter. Yet the
equally difficult part of being proficient
in thfe art of successfully hitting that
ball must be accomplished. It Is then
that he should employ the methods char
acteristic of Keeler of the Baltlmores
and Burkett of the Clevelands. These
batters never swing, but simply snap or
meet the ball. A case hit Is all they try
for, and in being able to pick out the kind
of a ball desired it is possible for them to
hit that ball in any directionâ right field,
left field, center held, along the third
base line, over second base, along thÂ«
first base line; any spot. In fact, that of
fers an opening-â it makes no difference
to bib -they simply meet the ball
square and it must go. Then, again, they
bunt without ever changing their posi
tion or making any kind of a move that
would telegraph their intentions. If a
third baseman plays In his regular posi
tion they will bunt. If he comes in close,
expecting a bunt, they will hit It at him
so fast that he cannot get his hands on
It unless Providence so decrees. In this
manner they keep every one of their op
ponents guessing as to what they Intend
doing next, and therein lies one of the
greatest arts of baseball. If I en to pitch
gainst a batter who never changes his
tactics I have nothing to worry me. He
does the same thing every time he comes
to .the bat, ami the whole team pulls
around In position for him. But the chap
â¢who snaps at a ball and keeps you figur
ing as to whether he is going to bunt
lie is the one to worry you. He keeps
your entire team guessing as to what he
Intends doing, and when he sees you
moving around In position he does just
the opposite to what you expect. He is
a "snap" hitter. He does â  not look for
home runs, yet each year Invariably finds
him. at the top. It should be the aim of
all players, be they amateurs or not, to
practice the best ana proper m^theods of
Vattinp. This can be accomplished only
by meeting or snapping the ball. First
learn how to meet it, then go to placing.
All batters should know how to bunt. If
a player cannot bunt he cannot sacrifice
properly, and a player who is unable to
sacrifice without endangering the base
runners, does not deserve the title of ball
player.. â â â

The ship Occidental sailed In and the ship Yosemite was towed In from sea yesterday. Both are coal laden
from Seattle, but the Occidental made the run in eight days, while the Yosemite occupied fourteen days In mak

the Yosemite encountered light winds and calms the first part of the voyage.
to carry soldiers to Manila. Had the Con
gressman who made the charges investi
gated the matter there would never have
been any outcry. ; '
When steamers were in demand for the
Klondike trade the Pacific Coast Steam
ship Company paid the Oceanic Steamship
Company $800 a day for the use of the
Australia. The Government is paying ex
actly the same figure for the use of that
vessel and her sister ship, the Zealandia.
With this difference, however,; The Pa
cific Coast Steamship Company 1 fitted out
the Australia at its own expense for the
Klondike trade, while in the case of the
Government charter the owners have done
considerable of the fitting out. :
Another case in point is that of the
steamer Humboldt, for which $$50 a day
is now being paid to carry passengers to
St. Michael. For the Klondike trade the
Pacific Mall Company could have got
more money than the Government is now
paying them for the use of their vessels;
but they refused point blank to withdraw
them from the regular traffic. In the case
of the Pacific Coast Steamship Company,
it was actually in want of steamers in
stead of having any to spare. No price
has been put on the Senator and Puebla,
and the loss of those vessels will seriously
interfere with its passenger trade. The
loss of the Australia and Zealandia leaves
the Oceanic Steamship Company without ,
a steamer for the Honolulu trade, and
the loss of the Peking, China, Sydney.
Colon and Para will seriously interfere
with the business of the Mail Company.
In no Instance was anything but a reason
able price asked for these vessels, so that
the outcry was ill timed and without
foundation.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company
will put the steamer Queen on the Puget
Sound route, and' Captain Jepsen, the
popular master of the City of Puebla, will
command her. The City of Topeka will
take the Queen's place on the Alaska
route. Captain Thomas will go out in
command of the City of Puebla on her
trip to Manila, and Captain Patterson will
command the Senator. "Tom" James,
who made himself bo popular on the
Honolulu run as chief steward of the
Australia! is going out in a similar ca
pacity on the Senator, while W. E. Curtis,
who has so ably catered to the Puget
Sound traveling public, will look after the
boys in blue on the City of Puebla. ; --
Admiral Dewey, the hero of Manila, has
been immortalized. A new schooner built
at Nehalem Bay for the coasting trade
has been christened after him. In a few
weeks the books of the Merchants Ex
change will chronicle the arrival of the
schooner Dewey .with a load of lumber
from Nehalem Bay. .
The steamer Morgan City having been
chartered to carry soldiers to Manila will
not be put in the St. Michael trade this
season. Her passengers will go north on
the steamer Humboldt, which arrived
from Puget Sound yesterday. The latter
vessel has some of the quickest runs of
any of the Klondike fleet to her credit.
She made two round trips between Seat
tle and Lynn Canal in 19 days 2 hours, in
cluding all stops. She will go on the
drydock to-day, and will be ready to start

The steamer Sunol is to make an excur
sion around the bay and up to Mare Isl
and and Vallejo to-morrow, leaving
Washington street wharf at 10 a. m. The
troopships now being fitted out will be
visited, and as two hours will be given
the excursionists at Vallejo there will be
ample time to examine the Philadelphia,
Yorktown. Monadnock and Nero at the
navy yard. The trip should be a very
pleasant one.
The steamer Oregon arrived from Port
land yesterday with the remains of Cap
tain Stephens aboard. On the trip north
the captain dropped dead on the bridge
from heart disease. His children met tne
steamer on her arrival and the remains
were removed to undertaking parlors.
Owing to the fact that both the Austra
lia and Zealandia have been chartered as
troopships by the Government there will
be no vessel of the Oceanic Steamship
Company, to take the sailing of the 29th
inst. Owing to the scarcity of suitable
ocean steamers it has been impossible to
charter a vessel to take the Zealandia's
place. A boat may be secured to po out
on the July 27 run, but it is doubtful.

MUST NOW FIND A
LOT FOR ITS DEAD
ITALIAN SOCIETY HAS NO CLAIM
UPON THE CITY.
Grant of Burial Grounds in the City
Cemetery Has Been Canceled
by the Superior Court.
The demurrer of the city and county,
the Mayor and Board of Supervisors and
the Board of Health in the action
brought against them by La Socleta
Italiana di Mutua Beneficenzi, in which
It sought to restrain the municipal au
thorities from prohibiting the burial of
the dead in the society's plat in the
Golden Gate and City cemeteries, was
sustained by Judge Hebbard yesterday
and the action ordered dismissed.
The cemetery lots were held by the so
ciety under a grant from the Coard of
Supervisors in June, 1879. In June of
last year the Supervisors passed an or
dinance prohibiting further burials in the
cemeteries after January, 1898. The ordi
nance was disputed by the plaintiff so
ciety, which claimed that it was illegally
adopted; that the society was discrimi
nated against; that no other lots had
been set apart to the society as required
by the act of March 27, 1868, and tha^t
while the city authorities still permitted
the burial of the indigent dead within
the City cemetery up to July 1, 1898, the
same privilege was denied the society.
A demurrer to the complaint was filed
by the various defendants, claiming that
the court had no jurisdiction of the sub
ject matter. The whole question rested
on one point which related to the valid
ity of the grant of the lots in the ceme
teries to the society by the Board of Su
pervisors in 1879. It was held that If the
grant was not sufficient to convey the
title to the land it would amount to a
mere license to bury revocable at the
will of the grantor. The court finds that
under the acts of the Legislature and
the orders of the Board of Supervisors,
the City cemetery was reserved for a
public purpose and that the conveyance
of it would be a violation of the trust
imposed by law upon the Board of Su
pervisors. It also held that the plaintiff
society, being a private corporation, the
Board of Supervisors was without power
to grant to it the cemetery lots; conse
quently, that the attempted grant was
invalid and through it the society held
no title.
For theFe reasons the plaintiff was held
to have no standing in court, and its suit
was ordered dismissed.
In Honor of Old Ireland.
A grand centennial celebration to com
memorate the Irish insurrection of 179S
was held at Foresters' Hall, Port Costa,
Wednesday evening, under the auspices
of Port Costa Lodge No. 7 of the St. Pat
rick's Alliance. The programme for the
event was of exceptional merit, and con
sisted of Irish patriotic songs and recita
tions, with a goodly introduction of
American anthems. Rev. Father Walsh
was the president of the celebration. The
programme in part was as follows: Vio
lin solo. Miss Buttner; song, "Erin's Sad
Memories," Josephine Dreschler; song,
"Yankee Dewey,'' Walter Herlitz; vocal
eolo, J. Kay; tableau, "Ireland and Amer
ica," Miss M. Cashman and Misa Ella

The Rev. Father Caraher acted as
speaker of the evening taking for the
subject of his address "The Irish Rebel
lion of 1798."

LUMBER IS
DEMORALIZED
E. K. Wood Company
Spoiled a Compact.
TOO CHEAP AN OFFER
FIRMS WILL SELL MATERIAL
AT THEIR OWN PRICES.
Harbor Commissioners Will Obtain
Jjumber at Greatly Reduced
Rates â Mr. Wood Ex
plains.
The lumber market has been demor
alized by the action of the E. K. Wood
Lumber Company In deserting the pre
arranged movement among large hand
lers of the useful commodity to uphold
the market by charging $14 per 1000 feet.
The Wood Company broke the spell a
few days ago by putting in a bid to the
Harbor Commissioners offering to furnish
them with lumber during the next six
months at $11 f<o. Their action was de
cried by other firms as it lowered the
standard of prices which they had set at
a meeting of the Retail Lumber Asso
ciation, and threats were freely made to
punish the firm for its audacity.
While condemning the move of the E.
K. Wood Company, many of the firms
will follow its example by lowering their
prices and bidding for the contract, which
they know will net them a neat profit,
in the hope of being awarded the con
tract.
As was published exclusively in The
Call of yesterday, a movement was on
foot to defeat the object of the desert
ing company by placing every obstacle
in its path that will prevent the fulfill
ment of the contract in the event of
their getting jt. It would seem that the
Wood Company's chances in that direc
tion are rather slim, as companies who
have had business with the board in
years past will lower their price with a
view to landing the plum. It is said
that if the E. K. Wood Lumber Com
pany's bid was equaled the board would
give it to a preferred company.
One thing is certain, and that is, the
Harbor Commissioners will obtain lum
ber cheaper this season than at any other
period in the past few years.
ft. K. Wood, who departed from the
unwritten law of the Retail Lumber
Dealers' Association, said yesterday: "I
am sorry that anything was paid in The
Call about the matter. It was simply a
tempest in a teapot, and I am sure has
already blown over. Our firm put a bid
of $11 50 simply as a business proposition.
We knew that at that price we could
realize a profit, and will be glad to get
the contract.
"One reason for bidding ns we did is
that lumber is cheaper now than sixty
days ago. Freight has also decreased
from $5 to $3. We do not expect to get
the business, nor do we want to get
into a newspaper controversy with those
in our lino of business. I have no ill will
against them, and I don't think they
have against me. I expect that other
companies will bid at the same price, and
as some are preferred by the Commis
sioners, I suppose they will obtain the
contract. -However, in the event our
company is chosen, I don't think the
other companies would be foolish enough
to refuse to sell us lumber, l am sure
they would not dare refuse, as they are
In the business to sell. We are not worry
ing on that score, as we can easily sup
ply ourselves with material from our
mill. The kind that is used by the Com
missioners is not scarce and can be eas
ily procured.
"The reason why the other companies
are complaintng is that we have lowered
the price of lumber. Some time ago, at
a meeting of our association, Mr. O'Brien
of Simpson & Co. made a motion that
retailers sell lumber to the Harbor Com
missioners at not less that $14, and as an
outcome of the motion those present
signed an agreement to that effect. Our
representative, M. Stephens, refused to
sign, not having the necessary author
ity. Not having been a party to the
agreement and seeing an opportunity to
obtain some business we put in our bid
accordingly."
Mr. Pennell of Simpson & Co. was
asked whether his firm would refuse to
sell the E. K. Wood Company lumber if
they found It necessary to buy. "Cer
tainly not," said he. "If Wood & Co.

want our lumber they can have it, but
they must pay us the usual tariff for it.
If it was $14 per 1000 feet, as it was some
months ago, they would have to pay
that price and get out of it as best they
could. I do not think they will be de
pendent upon us, as they have a mill of
their own. I am sure that lumber deal
ers will not refuse them material just be
cause they placed a bid of $11 50 before
the Harbor Commissioners. We are all
in the business to sell, and if they want
it they can buy at the current prices.
"It is true that Mr. O'Brien of our com
pany made a motion at the Retail Lum
ber Dealers' Association meeting that the
retail dealers should stand together and
keep the price of lumber at $14 50. Many
signed an agreemnt to that effect, but
the E. K. Wood Company refused. Their
placing a bid before the Commissioners
for $11 50 has had a bad effect on the
market. It being a public bia, dealers will
necessarily lower their prices to that fig
are. It has simply demoralized the mar
ketâbroken it up, as it were. I do not
think our company will bid for the con
tract." '
As was stated yesterday, the plan will
be to compel the E. K. Wood Company
to pay the ruling price for lumber if they
need it, which would entail a loss on the
contract.
EXPEDITIOUS WOBZ.
Two Would-Be Burglars Arrested
and Held to Answer Within
a Few Hours.
Frank Smith and August Normant, fre
quenters of the Plaza, on Kearny street,
were arrested about 1 o'clock yesterday
morning on a charge of attempted bur
glary, were arraigned and examined in
Judge Joachimsen's court a few hours
later and held to answer before the Su
perior Court in $2000 bonds each.
Policeman Edwards saw the two men
acting in a suspicious manner at the
grocery of Andrew Anderson, corner of
Leavenworth and Jackson streets, and
ctood in a doorway to watch develop
ments. When he saw them trying to
force open one of the windows with a
"Jimmy" he concluded it was time to act
anti he grabbed hold of Normant. Smith
ran and Edwards blew his whistle, which
was answered by Policeman Wiliiams,
who gave chase and soon overtook Smith.
When Edwards caught hold of Normant
he pulled a revolver out of his pocket,
but Edwards wrenched it from him be
fore he had time to use it. Normant
hud, also, possession of the "jimmy" and
a bunch of keys. Besides the charge of
attempted burglary charges of carrying
a concealed weapon and having burglar
tools in his possession were booked
against him. He was convicted on theso
charges, but sentence was deferred pend
ing the result of the felony charge in the
Superior Court.
MUNICIPAL EXPENSES.
Estimates Submitted by the Sheriff
and County Clerk.
The estimate of the County Clerk for
the probable expenses of his office for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1899, has been
submitted to the Board of Supervisors
and the Auditor. . The County Clerk asks
for $138,000; of this $6000 is for printing
and stationery and $6000 is for the print
ing of transcripts in criminal cases;, the
remaining $126,000 is for salaries.' In his
estimate the County Clerk states that
there is due on taxes $530,000 and there
h;us already been collected $200,000. The
income for the office for the coming year
is estimated to be $80,000.
Last year Mr. Curry was allowed $85,0*1.
The Sheriff has submitted the following
estimate of what he will need: Salaries
of office and of Jail No. 1, $80,960; ex
penses and subsistence of prisoners in
office and of Jail No. 1, $38,725; salaries
and expenses of Jail No. 2, $4o,700; sal
aries and expenses of Jail No. 3, $7610;
total, $172,995. This is not as much as was
asked last year by two or three thousand
dollars. . â

SECOND MEETING
OF CRICKET CLUBS.
Last Sunday the second match of the
season between the Alameda and Pacific
cricket clubs began at Alameda on the
Webster-street grounds. The Pacifies
went in first and put together 168 runs, to
which score the principal contributors
wen A. Dickinson 41, J. J. Theobald 31, F.
Sowell 19, H. C. Cassidy 16, and J. H. Har
bour 11. No fewer than seven of the Ala
meda team were tried as bowlers, and of
these F. C. Driftteld took 3 wickets for 25
runs, A. Price 2 for 23, J. J. R. Peel 2 for
33 and F. Croll 2 for 34. At the call of
time the Alameda team had scored 71 for
three wickets, F. Croll being not out 26,
and G. Croll not out 14. R. B. Hogue 9
and J. H. Spiro 15 were both caught off
Stiwell's and H. Bird, 3, was
bowled by Wallace.
The match will be continued to-morrow,
and, if the remaining wickets of the Ala
medas prove slow to fall, may end in be
ing drawn, as a two-day match which is
nDt played out is not decided by the score
in the "first inning. Should the match
bo. unfinished it is to be hoped that both
captains will agree to play it out on the
19tn, which is an open date, no matter in
whose favor the game may be when
stumps are drawn at 5:30 to-morrow aft
ernoon.

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
- ... ,
NEW YORK. June 10.â There was a brief I
struggle in the first hour of to-day's stock mar
ket to extend the reaction which has been In
progress during the week, when the prices sud- j
denly and vigorously took an upward turn, and â 
It was a runaway bull campaign for the rest of
the day. There was an enormous absorption of ]
stocks ascending the scale of prices, especially j
In Sugar, Brooklyn Transit, the grangers and a I
few of the leading specialties. The picking up '
of Inactive and dormant stocks, however, dis- i
tinguished the trading (fulte as much as the
aggressive strencth In the great speculative
leaders. The advance was made In the face
of several Incidents, any one of which would I
have been seized upon to raid down the whole
Hat In the reactionary spirit of the early part
of the week, but they were without the slightest
â¢ Influence in restraining the heavy buying of i
stocks. One of these Incidents was the mark-
Ing down of prices for Americans In London on
the score of the chronic British apprehension
that the currency and finance of the United
States were being unsettled and ruined by the
nation's supreme legislative body. London sold
stocks early on this ground, but at the ex
treme decline bought a little bit of Louisville
and Southern Railway preferred. These two
stocks suffered depreciation from the fear that
the establishment of quarantines against yellow
fever In the South would Interrupt traffic and
cut down their earnings. Reports from the
growing crops awakened an urgent demand for
the grangers. In which Burlington led with a
net gain of 2%. Atchlfon preferred Is up 1% on
the day. The market closed very active and
strong near the top.
Bonds merely held their own in the early
dealings, but prices rose and the volume of
business Increased later in the day. Total
sales, $S. 825. GOO.
United States old 4s registered on call de
clined V in the bid price, but later bid up X
per cent.
The total sales of stocks to-day were 621,500

FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK. June 10.â Rradstreet's Finan
cial Review to-morrow will fay.
More or loss Irregularity has been shown In
the movement of the market this week. War
and war news has been less of a factor, but
while the tone of the speculation has been gen
erally strong, there ha? been evidence of realiz
ing in groups of stocks which led the recent
advance, while fresh interests have come Into
l>r.imineticc and displayed strength. The bond
market's activity has reflected the renewed
prat Pee of investors. Governments hay-? 'In
clined a little in consequence of the passage of
the war revenue bill by the Senate with a bond
clause, and the certainty thus created that the
Government would soon bring out a new Issue.
On the other hand, the railroad bond list has
been advancing, the scarcity of the higher
prices for gilt edpÂ° securities creating a de
mand for tn>' second and even third grade of
ratlroad mortgages. London has both bought
and sold American stocks, though there still
appears to be a lack of public Interest in our
securities abroad, and the advances In the Lon
don quotations for them for several days are
ascribed to purchasing orders from this side.
While the market here has been active, there
has been a falling off in the amount of public
participation, and the efforts of manipulators
have been apparent in some of the more not
able movements, particularly the decline of
sugar and the advance of various specialties.
The sentiment of the street continues bullish.
The ease of money Is a supporting factor, and
while the delays In the progress of the wax and
the conflicting news or absence of any news
whatever from the scene of hostilities has been
calculated to hold back speculation, the under
lying feeling Is one of confidence In the result
and !n the strongly bullish effect of further suc
cess to our arms.
LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, June 10.â The Evening Posfs
London financial cablegram says: The stock
markets were quiet and dull to-day, the specu-
I latlve markets being depressed by the sharp
, setback in Grand Trunk on unfavorable traffic
statements. Americans suffered with Grand
, Trunk. Foreign stocks were Irregular, with a
| fall In Brazilians. I believe that today's with
drawal of Japanese coin from the Bank of Eng
1 land nearly exhausted the bank's BUpply of that
i coin and I do not think Japan will take much
â  bar gold from the bank.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, June 10.â crop damage reports
continued to be the chief bull Item In Wheat
at the start. There seemed to be a growing
apprehension that the harvest would be seri
ously delayed and that the grain would suffer
serious injury- Wheat in the southern half of
Kansas was said to be about ready for the
harvest, while " the '. fields were said to be
flooded. Numerous other telegrams from differ
ent parts of the country sent equally bad re
ports, . but Interspersed with the heralds ' of
calamity. were a few others of a more reassur-
Ing character, suggesting the possibility of
alleged disaster being more imagination â  than
the actual facts. There was a disposition to
watt for the Government report,-, and this
acted as a check to speculation. The clearing
up of the weather In Chicago caused a tempor
ary change In speculative. sentiment. The sun
In about two hours after the opening of the
session was beaming in at the windows of the
Board of Trade and melted- all the bull feel
ing out of the crowd in the Wheat pit. From
being very strong, the market became weak
and the early gain was more than lost. Gen

THE WOOL MARKET.
BOSTON. June 10.â The Boston Commercial
Bulletin will say to-morrow of the wool mar
ket:
The market was more quiet this week than
i last. This Is accounted for by the slackening
up In the demand for wools to be used in Gov
ernment clothing. The demand from the regu
lar sources has not Increased nor diminished
The establishment of a definite basis of value
has been of material advantage to the market.
Dealers have placed their wool on a rock bot
tom, level and are slowly building up from It,
There have been sales of fine medium territory
on a basis from 44c and 45c. I At prices being
paid in Utah and other sections in the West It
will cost from 46c to 47c to land the new wool
here, without considering profit or Interest
Offer* for fine medium territory at 40c and for
foreign combing at 62c and 63c have brought no
sales. The sales of the week are ,000 pounds
domestic and 313,000 ' pounds forelgns against
1,611.000 pounds domestic and 581,000 pounds for
eign last week and 1,651.400 â¢ pounds domestic

sonable quieting down of the spring demand
for and movement of merchandise, come proofs
that the spring business of the year IS9B. with
a few notable exceptions, has largely mat ex
pectations. Particularly confirming this latter
view of the situation are the heavy total* of
bank clearings, large railway earnings, heavy
exports, a total of failures well down to the
normal and exceptional steadiness In prices,
following the notaMe advances registered some
time ago. Weak or lower prices for a number
of cereals during the last week. In the face of
a heavy export business, point to thÂ« very Kood
crop prospects for Wheat and other grains, in
fluencing holders toward parting with their
stocks. Statistics of plgiron production point
to a slight reduction in output during the
month Just closed, due largely to shut down
for repairs, but the naturÂ« of stocks to ac
cumulate gives proof that the Immense recent
production has been met by an equally large
consumptive demand. The leading feature of
the week in the iron trade has been the col
lapse of the so-called "gentlemen's agreement '
in the Southern iron industry, and prices are
lower as a consequence, but an advance In
Bessemer pig le taken to Indicate that the
makers are getting In better shape to control
the output than for some time past. The fea
tures or the Iron and steel trade are the numer
ous small orders, amounting to a fairly large
aggregate for Immediate delivery, and the
booking of a number of orders for finished
products for export, but new business on next
season's account does not come forward very
quickly.
Following the little spurt !n the demand for
raw wool, largely In army orders, has come
a perceptibly less active demand for this staple
at the East, and the unsatisfactory conditions
in the manufacturing trades are reflected In
talk of curtailment of production.
Features of the price situation this week are
the steadiness of nearly all clashes of groceries,
of raw cotton and prices of print cloths and of
hides, leather and lumber, while decreases are
reported in cereals, lard, pork, copper and
steel rails.
Cereal exports are slightly smaller than laÂ«>t
week, but are still far above the total In i the
corresponding weeks of previous years, w heat
exports this week aggregate 4.7R0.952 bu;<hels^
against 5,248,000 bushels last week, I.DBfi,OOO

DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADIS.
NEW YORK. June 10.-R. O. Dun & Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade will say to-morrow:
The certainty that the Spanish fleet Is Im
prisoned and powerless to do harm has helped
to make the tone of the markets more confi
dent. Every step of progress during the week
which has looked toward an early termination
of the struggle has been reflected In the mar
ket and in lower rates for money. All indus
tries have felt the uplifting influence. In
finances the growing anxiety to lend on even
long exchange at lower rates, in place of ship
ments of gold to this country, begins to ac
cumulate a standing credit In favor of the
United States. A stronger situation It would
be difficult to describe,. Men have been buying
and selling stocks with some blindness, though i
the course of events has all the time warranted
a higher market. Other countries have jet to
pay In some way an enormous balance to the
United States on merchandise transactions and
It will save speculators much trouble and loss
to keep the fact in mind.
Men talk as if wheat had gone down out of
sight, but the collapse of the May speculation
has only made it more evident that the out
side world requires nearly If not quite all the
wheat this country can spare. Last week At
lantic exports, flour included, were 4,:-06.923
bushels, against 1,634,602 last year, and Pacific
exports were 233,213. against 125,212 lost year,
and It Is close to the end of the season. Over
2Ki,000.00n bushels of wheat has already been
exported and almost 200.000.000 bushels of. corn.
4,134.800 bushels during the past week, against
1,787,035 last year, and the market Is Justified
In feeling that those who have gone so far be
yond all precedent In defying current reports
are entitled to pay for it.
. Iron and steel production has declined be
cause several establishments have stopped for
repairs. Yet the weekly output June 1, 225337 i
tons, against 234. 1CG May 1. with the unsold
stocks, which decreased 18,142 tons during the j
month. indicates a consumption weekly of 223,
876 tons, against 728.25S in April, so that the 1
ablest Iron Journals are in error In saying the !
apparent consumption does not keep pace with i
the production of 1,000,000 tons monthly. East- 1
crn markets are much more embarrassed than
before, while the Westerns are crowded beyond
all precedent. But prices are not changing In
either section.
The woolen manufacturers are buying no I
wool, and the sales at the three chief markets
during the past week were only 8,549,300 pounds
against 4,878,750 in 1892. But the demand for
goods proves somewhat better In many direc
tions than was expected, and the Government
requirements have compelled some manufac
turers to buy somewhat largely grades of. wool
which they have not expected to require. The
auction Sale of carpets, resulting In prices said
to average 50 per cent below the last quota
tions, doe*, not . encourage buying, and In carpet
wools the market Is decidedly tame.
Failures for the week have been 203 In
the Lnlted States against 262 last year and 17 I
In Canada against 30 last year.

Harrison's Circular nays:
"This week there have been four deliveries
from British Columbia with 16.802 tons of coal
flyÂ« from Washington. 12,653 tons: two from
Oregon, 1150 tons; one from Australia, 4200
tons; total. 3.4,305 tons. Our coal arrivals thfs
week are 7000 tons in excess of the deliveries
here of last week. There are five transports
now coaling and ten more already engaged,
which will leave this month; these comblnedly
will â  require about 15,000 tons for Government
use. This may i=erve to reduce our stocks In
yard somewhat, still If our Northern shipments
SEnS? . diminished there will be no marked
k SrS'Vfc fo ,V thi f month. It must be remem
bered the diverting of eighteen steamers (three
5? â¦"r.Sl!**^! ? ft) i rom their usual channels
of trade, will for the moment draw consider
able fuel from our reserve, but It will be some
time before they will return here and again
become consumers, whereas in their regular
currency of business locally, they would In the
course of a few months have burnt up much
more. There are several overdue cargoes of
Australian, which constitute about all the coal
to arrive here this month from all sources ex
cept our Northern collieries. With such a
limited number |ft supply points, and those
concentrated In a very few hands.' it Is to be
wondered at that the Government purchases
have been made so low. There has been no dis
position shown to form-that customary "ring"'
when the Department is a large buyer. Prices
for fuel for domestic furposes have not been
disturbed since war was declared In April "

Alameda Politics Take a
New Departure.
FAVOR BUCKBOARD IDEAS
CANDIDATES SUDDENLY BECOME
ECONOMICAL.
Anything Suggestive of a Dude or of
a Tailor-itade Suit Is Very
Vigorously Tabooed These
Days.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
SOS Broadway. June 10.
The principles O f "buckboard cam
paigns" seem to have taken a firm hold
of Alameda County politicians, and of all
the host of office Beekers from those who
would like to be Governor down to the
man who would consider himself lucky
with a town marshal's deputyship there
Is a general desire to impress the voters
â with the idea that long hair, slouch hats,
seedy looking suits and unshined boots
and unshaven faces with unkempt hair
are necessary to lnÂ«ure success in this era
of politics.
Dr. George Pardee, evidently taking his
cue from Governor Budd, whom he some
what resembles, has set the fashion for
this county. The doctor is known to pos
sess a diamond or two and to have at
least one nice looking suit of clothes. It
is also believed that he has at least one
pair of patent leather shoes and a new
hat, but there has been nothing within
the past three months to indicate that the
doctor possesses any of taese. Every after
noon as he walks up Broadway he wears
a veteran looking overcoat buttoneu up
to the chin, a slouch hat, with the brim
turned downward rather than upward, a
Bult strongly suggestive of "hand-me
downs," and as to gloves, he never wears
them, probably because his hand has to
go into his pocket so often to pass out
cigars.
Next in order in the Broadway parade
Is Assessor Dalton. Mr. Dalton is not
poor, but many poor men cut a more
swagger appearance than the County As
sessor. The slouch hat, the greenish
black suit and the absence of anything
suggestive of wealth are equally appa
rent. Mr. Dalton even goes the doctor
one better, for whenever possible he links
his arm with some gentleman from the
country and undoubtedly makes a vote
before parting at Twelfth and Broadway.
This easy-going, hail-fellow-well-met
Btyle of deportment is also followed by
Sheriff White, who seep more men in
â walking a block than any other man in
Oakland. Deputy District Attorney J. W.
Stetson, one of the tallest and most im
posing looking of candidates, is also con
verted to the "buckboard" principle of
politics. He has cultivated a stoop that
rohs him of six inches of his height, and
he meanders up and down Broadway in
a manner not the least suggestive of
the military training he received at the
university.
Tax Collector Barber carries the thing
to excess, and since the present cam
paign broke out Mr. Barber would have
experienced great difficulty in changing
his entire wardrobe for $2 50 anywhere in
Oakland.
"W. R. Davis, the most conserva
tive of candidates, leans somewhat to
ward the new condition, though perhaps
not so prominently as his rival for the
Governor's chair.
The latest convert, however, is A. K.
Grimm, who has just been "discovered"
as an available and of course logical can
didate for Recorder. Mr. Grimm some
what resembles ex-Mayor Sutro, both in
appearance and mannerisms. He also
flourishes a slouch hat and long overcoat,
and c-ouid not be persuaded to wear a
diamond at this time upon any condi- .
tlon. It might also be added that Aarun '
A. Bretz, once an Assemblyman, is also
â well known for many of the characteris
tics of dress and deportment which now
are being followed by aspiring Republi
cans.
FIELD HOSPITAL NOTES.
Measles and Coids Have In
creased Since the Straw
Was Removed.
Â© The regiments of North and South Da
kota were put through an afternoon of
good hard practice in battalion and ex
tended order drilling yesterday. Their
work is admirable and not far from the
standard of efficiency in the regulars.
The field hospital is now rapidly filling
up. A majority of the cases are of
measles, induced, say the medicos, by the
cold fogs and blustering trade winds to
which Camp Merritt is wholly exposed.
The percentage of colds has also mate
rially increased since the order prohibit
ing the use of straw bedding went into
effect.
Though the number of measles cases is
large, there is no possibility of the mal
ady becoming epidemic, as the cases are
isolated in the infection ward of the
field hospital under the charge of Sur
geon Page.
Surgeons Owen, Morris and Crosby, of
the staff in charge of the field hospital at
Camp Merritt, received news yesterday
of the confirmation by the Senate Of
their nominations as brigade surgeons,
with rank of major.
Surgeons Owens and Crosby, with Sur
geon White, constitute the board appoint
ed to Burvey all United States transports
and report upon their sanitary condition
and equipment.
They were called from camp yesterday
noon to inspect the City of Para. The
sanitary Inspection of the different boats
of the transport fleet will be rapidly
pushed, as the laying in of supplies has
already begun, and regiment command
ers propose to begin the stowing
aboard of camp equipage to-day.
Local War Incidents.
A meeting of the San Francisco Hus-
Ears will be held at the armory, corner of
Market and Tenth streets, at 1:30 p. m.,
Sunday.
CaptaJn Lorenzo writes from Red Bluff
that he Is engaged in recrultinr tna Hus
pars to a full regiment. He Bays five
troops have been secured.
This morning there will arrive in San
Francisco 850 recruits from Fort McPher
eon, Georgia, for the Eighteenth and
Tv^enty-thlrd United States Infantry
regiments.
The Burdett School of South San Fran
cisco is bound not to be behindhand in
patriotism. Yesterday a four horse team
left the schoolhouse laden with beef, veg
etables, canned goods of every descrip
tion, boxes of eggs and great bundles of
literature. This is not all. however. The
school has collected a fund of almost $200
which is to go toward providing*eomiorts
for the brave fellows who go to Manila
to fight for the flag and for what It sym
bolizes.
One of the greatest works now being
performed in aid of the soldiers at Camp
Merritt is the nightly entertainment given
In the McCord warehouse under the di
rection of the ladies of the Christian En
deavor Society. Here at least 700 men at
tend nightly to listen to piano recitals,
read the latest periodicals and enjoy a
well-arranged programme of patriotic
recitations. Impromptu addresses and
eongs. The evening exercises close with
the distribution of refreshments, consist-
Ing of warm coffee, sandwiches cake, and
frequently other acceptable luxuries.
By this means the boys are kept away
from the demoralizing influences of the
saloons, which have become almost as
numerous as the tents in camp, and can
substitute the low amusement they may
find there by the healthy, instructive and
enjoyable entertainment that is cheerfully
extended to them by the ladies in charge
of the Christian Endeavor headquarters
South Dakota Grievance.
The enlisted men of the First South
Dakota Volunteers are about ripe for a
declaration of war on the regimental com
mlfcsarv. They say they are given corned
beef or a poor quality three times a day
and while the other troops are drawing
regular rations of fresh beef and bacon
they have not tasted fresh meat since
they left home, except at the meal that
was served to them on their arrival here
by the Red Cross Society.
The men attribute the whole trouble to
the indifference of the regimental com
missary, who is satisfied to draw the
regular field rations and never exerts him
self to make requisition for fresh beef.
The men threaten to lay their grievance
before Colonel Frost.
CAPT. STEPHENS' BODY ARRIVES
The Well-Known Mariner Will Be
Interred To-Day â His Death a
Great Surprise.
The body of Captain Charles M. Steph
ens, whose death was announced a few
days ago in the telegraphic columns of
The Call, reached this city yesterday on
the return trip of the steamship Oregon,
the vessel he commanded when death re
lieved him. The body was removed to the
undertaking establishment of J. S. God
eau, 305 Montgomery street, from which
place he will be buried this morning un
der the auspices of the American Associa
tion of Masters and Pilots.
Deceased leaves a widow and four step
children. D. W. Williams C. D. Williams,
Mrs. A. Sutherland and Mrs. H. Selenger,
to mourn his taking off. His lopa will al?',
be severely felt by the steamship com
pany, in whose employ he had been for
twenty-five years. He had by dint of
hard work and constant attention to duty
advanced himself from the lowly position
of sailor to that of conntmnaer. During
his residence in this city he made hosts
of friends by his genial manner and en
dearing ways, and his death will be pain
ful news to them.
His taking off was sudden. On the
morning of the 3d of this month, while in
transit to Portland he entered the pilot
house and in a few minutes he complained
of dizziness. He had hardly taken three
steps away from the latter place when he
fell to the deck. Everything was done
to revive him. but life was extinct. Heart
disease was the cause. Captain Stephens
was 50 years of age. a striking man in ap
pearance and weighed in the neighbor
hood of 240 pounds. He bore every appear
ance of being in the best of health and his
collapse occasioned great surprise. His
body was brofight in on the return trip of
the Oregon and the vessel bore a mourn
ful appearance with all flags at halfmast
and her officers in mourning.
The captain was beloved hy both officers
and men and it is expected they will at
tend the funeral in a body.
'ALF AND 'ALF OUT
IN THE STREET
TROUBLES MULTIPLY FOR THE
ST. GEORGE CLUB.
Unpaid Rent, Sheriff's Deputies and
an Unsatisfied Mortgage the
Cause of the Difficulties.
Trouble has been coming right in the
way of the St. George Club recently, but
in all probability the troubles of the club
are over: it is also probable that the club
has ceased to exist.
From time to time there have he*Â»n ru
mors of internal strifes threatening the
disruption of the club, and while they
were frequently affirmed by some of the
members they were as firmly denied by
others. Things have at last come to an
end. however. The buildings at 317 Ma
son street are owned by Captain H. Mat
thews, and he procured judgment against
the club in the sum of $350 for rent. Fre
quent demands for the money have been
made, but seeing it was not forthcoming
the matter was placed in the Sheriffs
hands, and after having given the cus
tomary four days' notice a posse under
the direction of Deputy Sheriff Galland
arrived on the premises and unceremo
niously turned everything out into the
street.
Shortly after the work of eviction com- I
menced a Mrs. Lapham arrived on the
scene with a $l<X>o mortgage on the pool j
tables, cash register and pianos. About |
the same time workmen from the ware- i
rooms of Kohler & Chase and the St. i
Germain Billiard Table Company came !
to remove the piano and billiard tables, !
which did not belong to the club at all, i
but were only rented, and all that was
left for the mortgagee was the stock of j
liquors and one of the pianos. Seeing she â 
had been duped Mrs. Lapham seized on
what she could get, and the uneneum- i
bered furniture was removed to a stor- J
age warehouse.

Mclaughlin at home.
A Royal Reception Tendered the
Major by His Friends.
It was a busy toy for Major Frank Mc-
Laughlin at the Republican State Cen
tra. Committee rooms yesterday after
noon. The major did not arrive in town
until 2 o'clock yesterday morning Jh ac
count of five hours' delay of the overland
train. There was a contingent of poli
ticians and old friends at the Palace
awaiting him even at that late hour and
this shortened the major's rest so much
that his usual exuberance of fine health
gave way yesterday to the physical fa
tigue which follows a long and hard trip.
But the reception that Major McLaugh
11 n had bestowed upon him when he en
tered the committee rooms did much to
restore his customary good spirits. The
rooms were decorated with gay colors
and garlands and wreaths. The glad
dening handshake and good wishes of all
his brothers in politics, those who re
ceived appointments and those who hope
for some to come, filled the air. The
splendid photograph of the major in his
light clothes was enwreathed in a cir
cle of sweet peas and he was happy.
Major McLaughlln did not have much
to say about his trip other than that It
was a private one with a little pudllc
business on the sifle.
NEW FREIGHT RATES.
The Big Advance in Tariff a Blow to
Jobbers.
The proof sheets of the new westbound
tariff rates were received by the various
railway freight agents Thursday, and

kindred commodities. The rates in
classes have been signally altered. The
first class rate is now $3 in the place of

$2 60 for $2 15; third class $2 20 for $2;
fourth class $1 90 for $170; class B $125

tariffs very severely. The new rates will
go into eeffct June 25.

MBS. BURBANK WINS.
Another Side Issue of the Walkerley
Estate Is Settled.
One of the many side issues of the con
test In the matter of settling the estate
of the deceased Oakland millionaire, Wil
liam Walkerley, was passed upon yester
day by the Supreme Court. It was in
the appealed case of H. C. Firebaugh
against Mrs. Blanche M. Burbank and
others. When Walkerley died he left the
larger part of his estate with his nephews,
Bacon and Barker, as executors of the
trust. The widow was not satisfied with
the arrangement of the trust and she
contested the will in the Superior Court,
and when the case was appealed to the
higher tribunal the court declared the
trust to be void. This left the nephews
and their attorney, Firebaugh, out in the
cold, so to speak, but the widow, who has
since become Mrs. Burbank. agreed to
make a donation to them. She made an
allowance to them for services, etc.. of
$21,000, and gave' Firebaugh a note for
$10,500, and under the terms S(rs. Burbank
agreed to pay the same out of the estate
in monthly installments of $500.
No payment was ever made and the at
torney began an action to recover the
value of the note. In her answer Mrs.
âºBurbank recited that no sufficient con
sideration had ever been given for the
note and that it had been obtained by
threats, duress and fraud. She won in
the lower court, and yesterday the Judg
ment of that tribunal was sustained by
the Supreme Court, which held that no
agreement of the nature stated could be
made by parties to an estate without an
order of the Probate Court in which the
estate was placed for settlement. Also
that there was no segregation nor count
in the account upon which the debt had
accrued, nor statement as to whether the
debt was for a commission or extraordi
nary services.
For Stealing Beer Faucets.
James JohnFon was yesterday sen
tenced to six months In the County Jail
by Judge Low for stealing about 350 beer
faucets from breweries. The junk deal
ers who purchased the faucets were in
court and the Judge told them that they
must have known that the articles were
stolen and warned them that if they were
not more careful he would instruct the
police to arrest them for receiving stolen
goods.
SPREAD OF YELLOW
JACK IN THE SOUTH.

to Have Troops Removed From
the Contagion.
WASHINGTON, June 10.â 'ihere is
some apprehension here over the out
break of seven cases of yellow fever at

manent camps from the lowlands to
higher elevations. The whole matter
has been referred by the President to
Surgeon General W'yman, with instruc
tions to make a report upon it at the
earliest possible moment.
Surgeon General Wyman said to

on the lookout these cases might have
been progressing for a long period
without being recognized. But there
is hope now, in view of their prompt
discovery, that the spread will be pre
vented."

grams received from McHenry to-day

effort to alleviate the wants of the boys in
blue. The cozy, rooms of the well-known
organization will be thrown open and vis
itors will have an opportunity to view the
haunts of scribes and professional men.
Fortune again favors the art students'
exhibition to be held to-day in aid of the
lied Cross. The accession Is the loan of
eighty sketches by a celebrated German
artist, Adolph Obst, who just arrived on
the Belgic from an extended tour in the
Orient. Mr. Obst won the study prize
at the Berlin Academy, and received liÂ»)
marks from his Government in approval
of his ability. When he learned of the
art students exhibition he consented to
loan his sketches, and has given one
painting of historical value to be added
to the students' collections.
All of the art schools have been well
represented, the Kerainic Club, the La
dies' Sketch Club. Polytechnic High School
and In fact all kind* ai:<i phases of art
have found expression >>n the walls of
the links room. The additional nanvs of.
exhibitors in arts are Charley Robinson,
Gordan Ross, Miss Van Winkle, Charles
liollo Peters. Arthur Kilyore, Blanche
Letcher, Mrs. Bushnell and Miss Le
Longe.
Frank Pelllcano Is decoratinpr the re
freshment booth, Mr. Johnson of '"'< Mar
ket street will supply the cakes, and San
born. Vail & Co. have made liberal dona
tions.
Among the first of the art students to
â¢respond to the call for contributions to
the Red Cross fund were Miss Martha
1,. Johnson and Mrs. C. Houndey, the lat
ter sending in an attractive pastel, while
Miss Johnson donated a clever piece of
â¢work, entitled "Wallflowers." These la- i I
dies are graduates of Hopkins, and their
â¢work gives promise of much talent. They
are now engaged on 1 a somewhat ambi- j
tious piece on an American subject, the
proceeds from the sale of which are to go
to the Red Cross Society.
The noble work done by the French
Hospital has been appreciated, not only
by the people of this city, but by others !
in distant States, as the following shows: i

MORE STREET CAR
LINES PROPOSED
A BENEWAL OF AN OLD FRAN
CHISE PETITIONED FOR.
Attempt to Change to Electricity, but
With a Clause in the Order
That Allows the Use of
Wire Cables.
The Market-street Railway Company Is
looking for more franchises, the latest
batch including half a dozen different sec
tions of the city which Jt desires to bene
fit by its presence. It also asks to hold
on to the present Geary-street line for
fifty years more, and to secure this end
it petitions to be allowed to transform
the present cable line into an electric
line, and to start up again In that way.
The petition for a franchise sets forth
that the Geary-street road is paralleled
on each side by electric lines, and that
people take those lines In preference to
the cable cars. It sets forth, further,
that it is thc-n'fore necessary to make an
electric line of the Geary-street road, but
to do bo would involve an outlay which
would only be justified by a long holding
of the road. It is petitioned that a new
franchise be granted, to take effect at
once, and to last for fifty years. In con
sideration the road will relinquish the
present franchise, which will run until
1903.
Should the franchise asked for wait un
til the expiration of the present one, it is
possible the new charter may go Into
effect, and in that case no franchise can
be let for more than twenty-five years,
and the road must pay a good deal more
than the 2 per cent of the gross earnings,
which it offers. I'nder any cicumstances,
therefore, it Is best for the company to
get right in, and it does so under the plea
tlmt It wishes to change the road to an
elec.rlc line. In the order allowing the
franchise drawn up by the company the
following occurs:
Section 3. It shall bÂ« lawful for the said
grantee, its â accessor* or assigns at Its or their
option, to propel curs over said railroad by
electricity with modern appliances and require
ments or by wire ropeÂ« running under said
streets and moved by stationary engines, or by
such . other meuns as may be sanctioned by
latv; and cars shall he run dally over said rail
road at least every fifteen minutes between the
hours of 7 o'clock In the morning and 9 o"clock
In the evening, except when prevented from do-
Ing so by riot or other unavoidable cause
It will be seen that should the order be
pr.ssed as submitted by the railroad com
pany the company would have the right
to run its cars with the wire rope now in
u*p, and the result pained by the trans
fer of the franchise would be to allow the
corporation to run on Geary street for
fifty years more, and under the same
terms as It was originally granted.
The other franchises asked for were as
follows:
Firstâ Commencing at the Intersection of Fol-
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL., SATURDAY, JUKE 11, 1898.
Bom and Army streets, thence along Army street
to San Bruno avenue, connecting there with the
existing tracks of the Market Street Railroad
Company on Folsom street and, Son Bruno
avenue.
Secondâ Commencing at Folsom street and
Preoita avenue, thence along Precita avenue to
Army street, and connecting with the exist
ing tracks on Army nnd PoUom streets.
Thirdâ Commencing at Stanyan and Frederick
streets, thence along Stanyan to Parnassus
avenue, thence along Parnassus avenue to
Fifth avenue, and connecting with the exist
ing tracks on Stanyan and Frederick streets.
Fourthâ Commencing at Forty-eighth avenue
and Point Lobos road and connecting with the
tracks on Forty-eighth avenue, thence along
Point Lobos road to the Great Highway, thence
alone the Great Highway to B street, thence
along B street to Forty-ninth avenue, and there
connecting with the existing tracks.
Fifthâ Commencing at Point Lobos road and
Forty-eighth avenue and connecting with the
existing tracks on Forty-eighth avenue, thence
along Forty-eighth avenue to an unnamed
street between B and A streets, thence along
that unnamed street to Forty-sixth avenue,
along Forty-sixth avenue to B street, along B
street to Forty-seventh avenue, along Forty
seventh avenue to C street and along C street
to Forty-ninth avenue.
Sixthâ Commencing nt Polk and O'Farrell
streets ami connecting with existing tracks on
O'Farrell street, thence along Polk to Geary
street, along Geary street to Taylor, along Tay
lor street to Port, along Post street to Leaven
worth, ftlnnp I-onvpn worth street to Vnllejo.
Seventhâ Commencing at tlie Intersection of
Jefferson street and the easterly boundary of
the Presidio, thence along Jefferson to Brod
erick, along Broderlck street to Francisco,
along Francisco street to Flllmore, along Fill
more street to Bay, along Bay street to East,
along East street to Broadway, oonecting there
with the present tracks on Broadway.
In the drafts of the orders allowing
these franchises it Is stated that the cars
can be run with electricity or cable, as
may be decided by the company, and the
amount which the city will get from the
gross earnings Is left blank.
Oscar T. "Webber Is also on the lookout
for a franchise, outlined as follows:
Commencing at Flllmore and Franolsco j
streets, along Francisco to Broderick, along ;
Broderick to Jefferson, along Jefferson to the !
Presidio.
He promises to run his cars from 6 In
the morning to 12 at night, and to give
2 per cent of the gross earnings of the
contemplated road to the city. He also
wants his franchise to last for fifty
years.
The franchises were considered briefly
by the Street Committee Thursday, and
then It was decided to lay the matter
over until to-day, in order to Investigate
the proposed lines thoroughly.
The line commencing at Stanyan and
Frederick streets and running out Fifth
avenue would pass the site for the Affili
ated Colleges.
General Miles, commander-in-chief
of the United States army, explains
the lessons of the present war in next
Sunday's Call.

THE SLATE
WAS ALL
PREPARED
First Meeting of the New
Democratic City and
County Committee.
No Opposition to the Cut and
Dried Plans of the Secret
Caucus.
The new Democratic City and County-
Committee met last evening and en
acted the cut and dried programme
prepared at the cecret caucus held by
the committee leaders Thursday.
The evening's slate was In the hands
of John Fay Jr.. and In the one or two
instances where It was necessary to do
a little coaching to smooth over any
possible hitch in the proceedings he
â was always present with timely
promptings that prevented delay and
annoyance.
The meeting was called to order by
Franklin K. Lane who Immediately
called for nominations for chairman.
M. Jasper McDonald placed John P.
Dunn In nomination "as a compliment
to his past services to the party." A
motion was immediately made that the
nominations be declared closed, and
Dunn was elected by a unanimous vote.
He was escorted to the chair by Mc-
Donald, Leggett and Fuy. After thank
ing the committee for the honor con
ferred upon him he said:
"We owe a duty to the Democratic
party of this city and State. I believe
that there is not one member of this
committee but who is willing and ready
to grant to all citizens what is th^ir
juet due. and when such a sentiment
exists there can he nothing but good
come from the deliberations of this
body. It is our duty to listen to the
suggestions of all good Democrats. We
are not here to make war, but to make
peace, and I think that before long we
will have gained the sympathy and
support of all good Democrats in the
city and in the State."
When the nominations for secretary
â¢were called for M. C. Hassett nroposed
the name of Thomas J. Walsh. A mo
tion that nominations be declared
closed was carried, and Walsh was
elected without a dissenting vote.
Max Popper "laced M. Greenblatt in
nomination for the office of treasurer.
A motion was made to declare the
nominations closed, and Mr. Greenblatt
â¢was declared elected by acclamation.
The secretary was instructed to call
the roll and seventy-eight answered to
their names. Amone the absentees
were John M. Kline.. I. Gutte, Rudolph
Herold, Ben Hawes, Howard Park,
John MoGilvray, Frederick Denlcke,
Louis Bartlett, J. V. Coleman, Dr.
Thomas Shumate. Edward Reddy, John
F. Twigg and Emil Pohl.
The secretary read communications
from three Democratic clubs pledging
support to the committee. In one of
the communications the name of Mayor
Phelan was mentioned, and this was
taken as the signal for applause, which
Indicated how far the committee is in
clined in favor of one of the men who
are responsible for its existence.
Motions were made for the appoint
ment of committees on registration, nat
uralization, resolutions, district organ
ization and headquarters, each to be
composed of five members. Joseph M.
Nougues wanted to know how much
time the chair would take In making
up the committees. He thought the
appointments should be made at once
and suggested that a recess of fifteen
minutes be taken in order to allow the
chairman time in which to make his
selections. This was a move evidently
not down In the programme, for cries
of "No" were heard in various parts
of the hall. Chairman Dunn said he
did not want the impression to go

forth that he could not appoint the
committees at once, but that he would
prefer to take a little time to select
the names. James H. Barry and others
of the programmers came to his re
lief, and on motion it was agreed that
the committees should be named at the
next meeting.
The committee then adjourned, to
meet again next Tuesday evening.
REVOLT AMONG
THE DEMOCRATS.
WILL INSIST UPON HAVING
OPEN PBJMABIES.
Trouble for the Phelan Wing of the
Party â Denounce the County
Committee.
The self-appointed bosses of the local
Democracy are rapidly drifting: into a
whirlpool that will certainly engulf
them and the party next November. It
is true that they have control of a mu
tual admiration assembly, styled by
them the Democratic City and County
Committee, but the rank and file of the
Democracy is not in sympathy with
them. The followers of the Rainey-
Harney wing of the party are still sulk
ing in their tents and not a few of them
declare that they would much rather
see the party go down in defeat in No
vember next than submit to the dicta
tion of Mayor Phelan and "Whisper
ing" McNab. The Harney people are
willing to go back into camp on the
one condition that a new county com
mittee be elected and that the dele
gates to the several nominating con
ventions be elected at open primaries.
They will not submit to the rulings of
the City and County Committee ap
pointed by nine members of the State
Central Committee, inasmuch as it Is
generally understood that the County
Committee will take upon itself the re
sponsibility of appointing the delegates
to the several conventions. The Har
neyites are willing to meet the self
appointed dictators and their follow
ers in a primary battle, and they will
pledge themselves to abide by the re
sult. The Phelan contingent is op
posed to a primary and there the mat
ter stands.
There Is also more trouble in store
for the new Democratic City and Coun
ty Committee. A number of Demo
crats who are disgusted with the man
ner in which the party machinery has
been handled of late years are prepar
ing a bombshell and when it explodes
there will be destruction and havoc in
the Phelan-McNab camp. These Dem
ocrats are not looking for offices or
places. They only ask that the Dem
ocratic voters be given an opportunity
to show at a primary just who they
want to represent them in the nomi
nating conventions. About fifty of
them met In Scottish Hall a few nights
ago and temporarily organized by elect
ing M. Schwartz chairman and A.
Jacobs secretary. After discussing the
Democratic political muddle for several
hours the following resolutions were
adopted, as representing the views of
the members:
Whereas. The Democratic State Central
Committee of the State of California re
cently appointed a committee of nine
members, who in turn selected a commit
tee of 100 and conferred on the latter all
the rights, powers and privileges that
belong exclusively and absolutely to the
THE SAIST FBAU CISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JTTtfE 11, 1898.
the city and county of San Francisco,
namely, the right to select their delegates
to the State, municipal and legislative
conventions; and whereas. That said right
and powers conferred on this committee
Of 100 is an arbitrary and high-handed
proceeding on the part of the State Cen
tral Committee, a usurpation of authority
and powers never delegated by the voters
of the Democracy to the State Central
Committee, a usurpation of authority not
in consonance with nor in harmony with
the principle of true Democracy, whereas,
That said action of the State Democratic
Central Committee cannot but ultimately
cause the complete defeat of the Demo
cratic party, the loss of confidence of the
rank and file of the Democratic party in
the State organization, the rejection of the
nominees of the State, municipal and
legislative conventions by the Democratic
party of the city and county of San Fran
cisco for the one and only reason that the
voters of the Democracy will be unrepre
sented in the conventions of the party;
whereas. That said committee of 100 is
not a representative Democratic body,
but, on the contrary, is made up, with a
few exceptions, of all shades and degrees
of professional politicians, ballot - box
stutters, heelers and professional Jury
men, who have followed in the waie of
every successful Democratic boss for the
last twenty years, whether Buckley, Pop
per, McNab or Rainey; whereas, The
time of action has arrived, and for the
sake of the purification of the party It
behooves all true Democrats to shake off
the yoke and the tyranny of the self
constltuted dictators of the party, to as
sert their independence and refuse to sup
port the nominees of the conventions of
an unrepresented Democracy; therefore,
be It
Resolved, That we, the undersigned
Democrats of the city and county of San
Francisco, feel it our duty to assert our
Independence a 6 true and loyal Demo
crats and ask every loyal and patriotic
Democrat to loin hands with us in this
movement; and be it lurther
Resolved. Firstâ That the principles of
the National Democratic party will be
our guiding star.
Secondâ That the National Democratic
platform is hereby Indorsed.
Thirdâ That none but honest and unsel
fish men should be placed in positions of
trust.
Fourthâ That the State, municipal and
legislative conventions 6hould be repre
sentative of the whole Democratic party,
and that the delegates to me aforesaid
conventions should be selected and voted
for by the Democratic party at primary
elections held for that purpose.
Fifthâ That nominees should be selected
from the best men in the party.
Sixthâ That no secret forces should be
tolerated in selecting nominees or ap
pointees for office.
Seventhâ That personal llbertv and
equal rights are the heritage of Democ
racy and should be guarded with jealous
eyes.
Eighthâ That the prosperity and per
petuity of the nation depends upon the
education and happiness of the working
classes and their interests should be the
first consideration of our legislative
power.
A pledge that the members will not
support any ticket nominated by an
appointed convention is being quietly
circulated and it is said that over six
hundred Democrats, who have never
before taken an active interest in party
affairs, have signed it.
With the opposition of the Harney-
Rainey men to overcome and the oppo
sition of Democrats not identified with
any faction, things are looking very
dark for Phelan and McNab.

at El Campo.
As a matter of fact It is so healthy at

Sudden Death From Apoplexy.
O. G. Tlndall of 1054 Third street, Oak
land, fell dead yesterday morning while
foing to work in the paint factory ot Co
urn & Tevis at 619 Front street in this
city. The deceased was 65 years old and a
native of Ohio. He leaves a widow and
children. Apoplexy Is believed to have
been the cause of death.
A SOLDIER'S WIFE IN WANT.
In a small and poorly ventilated room In a cheap lodging house at 664%
Howard street, the wife and one-year-old baho of a California volunteer
soldier, now on his way to Manila Bay, dwell in great poverty. That the
wife and baby have a place to rest when night falls is solely due to the
kindness and good-heartedness of the proprietor. The unfortunate woman
is friandteM and, according to the stories told by the other roomers, she
not infrequently goes to bed without having broken her fast during the
day.
Among the first to enlist when the call to arms was given by President
McKlnley, was Edward Kilcline. He passed the medical examination and
was assigned for duty with Company A of the First California Regiment
of Volunteers. He had been out of steady employment for a time, and was
in straitened circumstances when he offered his services to Uncle Sam. His
wife and baby are now in actual want and suffering.
"I don't like to talk about the matter," said Mrs. Kilcline yesterday,
"and I would not if it were possible to hide from the world the story of
my poverty. But I must do something for my baby. Some days I man
age to eatâ other days I don't. If it was not for the kindness of the pro
prietor of this house, I do not know what I should do. He has not alone
allowed me the use of this room, but he has also assisted me in other
ways. The night clerk has also been kind to me, and but for them
I would have much oftener gone hungry. lam willing and ready
to work, but I cannot find employment. Since my husband enlisted, I
have had a few days' employment washing for private families. The pay
was small, but enough to get a little food for myself and the baby. I am
in hopes that I may be able to find other employment and keep my
baby with me. I must find something to doâ but it would break my heart
to have to part with baby."
The baby, a bright-eyed but pale-faced tot, was playing on the floor of
the dingy room. He found a piece of string and commenced chewing on
it.
"Don't act that way, baby," said the unfortunate mother, as the tears
filled her eyes, "for you make me feel that you are hungry."
MARIE MILLARD'S NEW ROLE.
She Will Now Shine as a Wife
and Mal^e a hjome b[appy.
Miss Marie Millard, who will be pleasantly remembered as the prlma
donna at the Tivoil two years ago, la about to be married to Louis F.
Gottschalk, musical director. The wedding will take place in New York
City on June 12, at the residence of Mrs. Marshal Cushlng.
Miss Millard is tho. daughter of the late Harrison Millard, whose songs
have become famous, particularly his "Waiting" and "Under the Daisies."
She made her first appearance before the public In a concert with her father,
singing his songs to his accompaniment. She has since played prima donna
roles In grand opera, a* well as in opera comique, her flrnt engagement
being with De Wolf Hopper in "The Lady or the Tiger."
Her sister married the son of George E. Goodman, the banker, of Napa.
Mr. Gottschalk, the talented young man with whom she is about to join
her fortunes, is at present in Boston, directing the musical portion of the
new production which h:is just opened at the Tremont, and for which he
wrote some of the music. Frank Daniels' company will arrive with Mr.
Gottschalk as musical director.
He is spoken of as a splendid fellow, and as for Miss Millard, there Is
no one more generally loved by companies she has been in and, in fact, by
every one with whom she ha? come in contact.
Her charming character was perhaps most plainly Indicated In her ten
der and touching devotion to her father during his last illness.
The good wishes of the community are extended to them both In the
new role they axe about to assume.
SCHWERIN CONDEMNED
BY LABOR'S SONS
HOT RESOLUTIONS PASSED BY
THE LABOR COUNCIL.
Multitudes Cry Out Against the Per
fidious Actions of a Man Appar
ently Without a Con
science.
EverybÂ°^>' ff-ems to have a bone to pick
with Schwrln of the Pacillc Mail Steam
ship Company. Prominent business men
as well aa the humblest employes of this
would-be czar of the water front either
openly or secretly despise him.
In spite of his efforts to have the farts
suppressed The Call has already told the
people how he pent the boys in blue to
Manila, and now from the San Francisco
Labor Council, through the agency of the
Coast Seamen's T'nion, comes another ac
count of his perfidious actions. The work
ingmen of this city have no fault to find
with anybody in particular, and no names
are mentioned In the resolutions, hut If
the shoe fits Mr. Schwerin he is entitled
to wear It. It Is presented to him with
full compliments of 20.000 organized work
ingmen, whose only hopes are that his
corns are numerous wherever the shoe is
tight. They don't count on his conscience;
it is of such an adamantine nature that
they despair ot being able to soften it
with anything from fire to water. The
resolutions adopted are as follows:
Whereas, The steamer China, chartered by
the Government as a transport to convey
troops from San Francisco to the Philippines,
has shipped a crew of deck hands and firemen
composed entirely of Chinese: therefore, be It
Resolved, By the Pan Francisco Labor Coun
cil, In regular s>>ssi'>n assembled, that we con
demn this action on the part of the own.-rs
of the steamer China, as a clanger to the lives
of the troops an injustice to American seamen
and firemen by denying them the opportunity
of employment, and an act prompted solely by
motives of greed and displaying criminal in
difference to the interests of the nation in the
present crisis: and, further
Resolved, That we urge upon the Navy De
partment that steps be taken to compel the
shipment of an American crew on the steamer
China and to prohibit the further shipment of
Mongolian crew? on any vessel in the service of
the Government; and. further
Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions he
forwarded to Secretary of the Navy Long and
to the Senators and Representatives of Cali
fornia, with a request that Tne necessary action
be taken in the premises; and also that a copy
be given to the press.
