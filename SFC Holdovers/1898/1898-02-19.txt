TORPEDO SENT
TO DESTROY
THE MAINE

Atrocious Crime Was
Committed.

Saw the Missile Coming.
EY WEST, Fla., Feb. 18.â I visited the
Marine Hospital this evening and, through
the courtesy of Surgeon Guitieras, was
permitted to see nine seamen of the Maine
who are placed under his charge. I found
them as contented as their conditions
would permit. They all assured me they
were receiving every possible care and at-
.tent ion andseveral expected shortly to be
s discharged from the institution, notwith
*"â â **" standing the fact they were among those
most seriously wounded.
From Frank G. Thompson, a petty officer of the
Maine, now under treatment at the hospital, I obtained
some additional facts connected with the disaster.
He says that shortly before the explosion he was on
the port gangway with twenty-five or thirty others
who, like himself, had gone there to get a whiff of fresh
air, as it was too warm below. They all turned in at
9 o'clock.
Shortly afterward he heard the sentinel's call of
"All's well!" from the Spanish warship Alfonso XIII,
which was answered by an encho from the fortifica
tions on either side of the harbor. Just as he fell
asleep he felt a shock like an earthquake. Opening his
eyes he saw what appeared like a hurricane of flames,
by which he was hurled into the air, falling into the
water, whence he was removed and taken aboard the
Spanish war vessel. He is firm in the belief that there
were two distinct explosions and that the first, which
lifted the bow of the Maine, did not occur in the maga
zine. He says the magazine had been visited but a
short while previous and its temperature was cool.
He had never felt that the slightest danger menaced
the magazine and he had previously seen it so warut

during target practice that he could scarcely place his
hand upon it.
What appeared to have made the deepest impres
sion on all with whom I have conversed in relation to
the matter is the fact that the explosion should have
occurred after the 9 o'clock "tattoo," when every man
was in his hammock asleep and the lamps put out.
Another singular feature is the talk about mysteri
ous boats and other floating ob]ects some of the
Maine's crew say they saw immediately preceding the
explosion. They say a small black boat entered the
harbor and circled the Maine several times during the
evening.
"Quartermaster Ferris," Thompson states,
"hailed this mysterious boat twice as she approached
the Maine on the port side, but received no response.
Thompson also says that Immediately preceding the explosion the
officer of the deckâ Lieutenant Blandinâ saw through the gloom a
brilliant object which looked, as the officer subsequently described
it, as though a ship were afire on the starboard. He called the cap
tain's orderly â William Anthony â intending to report the circum
stance to Captain Sigsbee, but before he could do so the explosion
took place and both were hurled into the water."
Both were saved and will undoubtedly give evidence which will
be material at the court of inquiry which, I am informed, will be
convened in this city. An official examination of the Maine has al
ready been ordered. Six divers with outfits were sent to Havana
by the Olivette to-night.
Public interest in the destruction of the Maine continues un
abated. It is the all-absorbing topic of discussion in this city. One
thing that tends to keep up interest in the Maine's disaster is the
constant movement of the vessels of the fleet, the frequent arrivals
and departures from this port being In obedience to instructions
from Washington. The arrival or departure of torpedo boats to or
from the flagship New York, which still rides at anchor outside the
bar at the entrance to this harbor, never fails to attract a crowd of
idlers who, although in entire ignorance of the object of the messen
ger's mission, are convinced that in some manner it ?s connected
with the deplorable accident. The presence on the street of
survivors with bandaged heads or injured bodies never fails to draw
crowds. If the injured bluejacket possesses a garrulous tongue he
is never without an attentive and appreciative audience.
Reports from the army barracks and Marine Hospital, where the
wounded seamen are being cared for, show they are rapidly
convalescing, and the majority, whose injuries were slight, will
shortly be discharged from the institution as cured. Others,
however, whose wounds are of a more serious character, must
remain cripples for life.

According to His View, the Fire on
the Maine Started From a
Powder Magazine.

like the Maine, men cannot set fire to
the powder magazine without having
first perforated the double-bottom and
"coffer dam."
The fire in this case was so instantan
eous that at the moment of the explo
sion of the grenade which shot out
from the Maine, flames were sweeping
over the deck c-f the vessel. That shows
the fire started from the powder maga
zine. The Innumerable successive ex
plosions show that the fire was then
reaching the reserve magazine and
rapid-fire ammunition. The body of the
hull appears to open on the bow from
within. The deck is raised, turned into
a sort of vault and covered with innu
merable fragments. A red-hot bolt fell
on the port awning of the Spanish war
ship Legazpi, which set fire to the awn

NEW YORK, Feb. 18.â Rev. J. Minot
Savage of the Church of the Messiah,
responding to a toast at the banquet of
the Pulp and Paper Manufacturers last
night, said:
"As one thinks of the sad disaster
that has befallen the Maine in the har
bor of Havana, he can but wonder at
the patience of the people of the United
States. We have been thrilled and
stirred by the massacre of the Armen
ians, but one here at our door has been
worse, yet we have had patience.
"I do not advocate war, and I would
like to see the day when all affairs
could be settled by arbitration, but the
limit of patience and* humanity may
come. Let us be ready to stand up for
that freedom and manhood upon which
the country rests. We ought to have
dignity and power with every country.
We should have a navy. If we cannot
build one rapidly enough let us find
where they have one for sale. Let us
buy one and then dare to assert our
will."
Dr. Savage's words caused intense
enthusiasm, the guests rising to their
feet and cheering. __

FOR WAR
Steps Taken to Guard the
Defenses of This City
About the Bay.
No Chance for Spanish Treachery
to Tamper With the Big Guns
in This Harbor.
HE United States
Government is
making active
preparations for
war. On this
point there is
not the shadow
of doubt Since
the disaster to
the battleship
Maine in the
harbor of Ha
vana the War
Department has .
issued orders for immediate prepa
rations to resist attack and di
rected that extra vigilance be taken
to prevent any persons treacher
ously tampering with the modern
breech-loading guns commanding
the important harbors of the United
States.
It is definitely known that the
department at Washington has
wired General Shatter to use the
utmost vigilance in guarding the
guns ot this harbor. The telegram
from Washington to General Shat
ter is elaborate and gives in
structions in detail regarding the
desired preparations.
General Shatter, who was in
Bakersfield when the message came
over the wire, at once ordered
necessary precautions. In obedience
to orders the guards at Fort Point,
Lime Point and at the mortar and
dynamite batteries were doubled.
Yesterday the regular force of
patrol guards was largely in

garded as imminent or probable, but it is
doubtless surmised by the military authori
ties that Spanish sympathizers might, in the
event of a sudden outbreak of hostilities,
seek to place a charge of dynamite under
the big rifled guns which command the ap
proach to. the harbor of San Francisco.
The instructions by wire from Washington
go further than directions for added
vigilance in guarding the heavy ordnance.
Orders came to have ammunition ready for
immediate use. A careful inspection of all
the batteries has been ordered by General
Shatter. He was in Bakersfield last night
and gave his orders by wire from that
point. Every gun is being minutely in
spected to ascertain if anything is out of
gear that may require the attention of a
machinist. The stock of ammunition for
the twelve and ten inch rifles and the mor
tars is not very large, but is sufficient for
any immediate requirement in the event of
hostilities between the United States and
Spain. The reserve supply for the batteries
of ihis harbor is stored in Benicia arsenal.
In accordance with orders from the
department commander, Co/one/ Miles, com
manding the post at the Presidio, gave the
necessary orders for posting the additional
sentries at the fortifications. Colonel Miles
was asked by The Call yesterday if the
extra vigilance ordered embraced a patrol
along the shore of the Presidio to prevent
persons from landing in small boats. He
said, in answer to the inquiry, that the
patrol system was complete and that the
batteries were carefully guarded against
the approach of unauthorized persons. He
expressed the hope that the newspapers
would have little to say concerning the extra
precautions, as the publicity might tend to
inflame the public.

WHY McKINLEY
FAVORS THEORY
OF ACCIDENT
Wants to free Cuba, but to At
tribute the Disaster to Design
Would be Casus
Belli.
NEW YORK, Feb. 18.â A Washington special to the Press says:
From a source entirely trustworthy it is learned that the President
has adopted a definite future policy on the Cuban question.
He has attempted no interference with Spanish rule so far, and
contemplated none. He has contented himself with remonstrances and
friendly requests to Spain for peace. Nothing has resulted but the
farce of autonomy. The time is approaching for action. The con
ditions which exist cannot be permitted to continue much longer with
out becoming a reproach to the civilized world, and to the United
States in particular.
Everything will depend on the outcome of the Maine disaster. If
it is proved to have been due to accident the administration will open
negotiations for Cuba's freedom. If foul play is discovered the plan
will be held in abeyance.
Briefly stated, the President intends to favor the purchase of Cuba
by the insurgents, with the United States to guarantee their offer. The
"Cuban custom-house and Cuban exports will be a guarantee for the
safety of any loan raised for this purpose. It is the President's con
viction that he will experience no difficulty in getting the approval of
Congress. The war debt of Spain is not to be included, but Spain will
of necessity have to fix the price of her colony.
There have been frequent consultations on this subject, and it is be
lieved to have made progress to completion so far as the executive
intention can go.
Mr. Long, Secretary of the Navy, said to-day that as soon as
authentic information is received from the board investigating the
Maine disaster the President will act in a way to satisfy the American
people. If the tragedy is found to be the result of carelessness it should
be immediately known, but if the horrible destruction of life can in
any way be laid to the door of Spain satisfactory steps will be taken
at once.
The administration view for the present favors the theory that the
disaster cannot have been caused by means other than an accident. If
any other view was taken by this Government before an official inquiry
it would be a casus belli for Spain.
ment remarked that there were no Spanish
cruisers in Pacific waters, and that the
precautions taken were ordered to prevent
cranks, fanatics and spies from tampering
with the guns. The measure of precaution
was no doubt suggested by the terrible
disaster to the Maine.
Whatever comment officers may make to
newspaper men, it is known that they re
gard the instructions from Washington as j
a war preparation. In fact, the troops at \
the Presidio garrison are to-day prepared
to fight. The ammunition is on hand, the
guns are in position, so that the effective
batteries could open fire at once.
Yesterday Lieutenant Babbitt of the Ord
nance Corps tested the Santa Cruz speci
mens of smoke/ess powder, and the results
were highly gratifying. It was demon
strated that the plant at Santa Cruz could
fulfill . the Government requirements. The
tests were made yesterday with one of the
ten-inch rifles mounted on a disappearing
carriage. The report of the explosion was
quite heavy, but very little smoke was
perceptible. The initial velocity of the
projectile was 2000 feet per second. In
the event of an emergency the powder for
the big rifles could be supplied here. The

VALLEJO, Feb. IS.â No word has yet
been received at the navy yard to pre
pare for an emergency. Admiral Kirk
land expected to receive some commu
nication from the Navy Department
almost hourly to-day to prepare the
vessels under his charge for sea, but
no word came.
Only two war vessels on the coast
can be relied on for instant use in an
emergency, and these are considered
by naval officers to be the most effec
tive ships of the Pacific fleet. They are
the monitors Monterey and Monadnock,
now at Monterey. The Oregon is in the
dry dock at Port Orchard, and though
it will take several weeks to complete
the repairs to be made in her she can
be sent to sea in a very few hours' no
tice and perform all the service that
can be expected of a battle ship of her
class.
The Philadelphia, Charleston and
Yorktown are at the navy yard. They
have been placed out of commission,
and it will take several days to put
them in a condition for sea. It will not

land says it will need money to do the
necessary work on them to put them
ready for service.
"Before any work can be done here,"
said the admiral, "the Navy Depart
ment or Congress will have to give the
yard some money. With money we can
do wonders, and if we have funds we
can with the fleet at our command
guard this coast against any force the
Spaniards might send against us.
"As far as we are concerned on this
coast we are not absolutely prepared
for an immediate declaration of war,
but we could, should Congress give us
the money, put our fine ships in a con
dition to meet any foe Spain could send
against us before their vessels could
reach this coast. The two monitors and
the Oregon cofold take care of any that
might be in the immediate vicinity,
and by the time they were needed, to
defend the shore the Philadelphia, the
Charleston and the Yorktown would
be ready for sea."

FORT SHERMAN, Idaho, Feb. 18.â
Ever since the report of the disaster to
the Maine reached this post intense ex
citement has been brewing in the six
companies of the Sixteenth Infantry
stationed at this point. The excitement
culminated to-night when orders were
received to transfer Company H of this
post, commanded by Captain Whitehall
and Lieutenant Irwin, to Fort Stevens,
Ore. Fort Stevens !s an abandoned
post on the south side of the Columbia
River at Point Adams, where there is
a lighthouse station. It is on the
northwestern extremity of Oregon, op

While the orders simply require the
company to be put in readiness to move
it is expected it will start for its new

THE SCENE OF THE DISASTER.
two companies at Fort Spokane, Wash.,
are intensely excited over the orders,
as shown by the telephone messages
from the latter post. Speculation is
rife as to the whole meaning of this in
itial movement. Indications seem to
point to the early transfer of the head
quarters of the Sixteenth to Vancou
ver Barracks, Wash.
The Sixteenth was transferred to
Fcrt Sherman and Spokane in Octo
ber, 1806, taking the place of th.? Fourth
Infantry sent to Fort Sheridan, 111. It
came from Fort Douglass, Utah. The
regiment is commanded by Colonel
Hugh A. Theaker, until recently lieu
tenant-colonel of the Fourteenth In
fantry, which has been stationed at
Fort Vancouver since time immemorial.
Fort Stevens, to which Company H
goes, while filling an important posi
tion, has long been abandoned, and is
considered of little real use unless it is
equipped with modern ordnance. Nev
ertheless the orders to reoceupy the
post indicates that the Government is
desirous of manning its seacoast forts.
Under ordinary circumstances a com
pany of the Fourteenth would have
be<en sent there from Fort Vancouver,
but the Fourteenth has been seriously
weakened by the sending of troops to
Alaska. .Dr. Skinner, assistant sur
geon, -will accompany Company H to
Fort Stevens, Dr. Brechemine, the
regimental surgeon, has been ordered
to cut short his leave and return to
Fort Sherman at once.
Officers high in the Department of the
Columbia predict that the post at Port
Townsend, abandoned in 1895, and all
the coast forts on the Pacific, will soon
be garrisoned.
It is known here that secret orders
have been issued to regimental com
manders throughout the army to hold
themselves in readiness to move to
new stations at an hour's notice. This
is taken to mean that a mobilization
at coast points, especially the Gulf
Coast, is proposed should the situation
become more serious. Still the army i
men are anxious, because the sending
of troops to Alaska has seriously crip
pled the fighting strength of the reg
ular army. Secret orders have been
issued to the higher officers of the Na
tional Guard in the border States to
hold themselves in readiness to assist
in the reorganization of the National
Guard into volunteers should it be re
quired, it is known that everything
is in readiness to have volunteer re
cruiting stations opened in the border
States at thirty minutes' notice should
the War Department require them.
NO TIME IS LOST
IN THE HOUSE.
Boutelle Secures the Passage of the
Besolution Belating to the
Maine Horror.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 18.-In the
House to-day, immediately after the
reading of the journal, Boutelle (R.)
of Maine, chairman of the Naval Com
mittee, asked unanimous consent for
the consideration of the resolution pre
pared by the Navy Department and
passed by the Senate.
The mere mention of the Maine dis
aster on the floor brought members in
crowds from the cloak rooms and
lobbies, and they thronged down the
aisles to listen. The' spectators in the
galleries leaned over with breathless
interest as Secretary Long's letter was
read.
"It is unnecessary to say," said
Boutelle, at the conclusion of the letter
from Secretary Long, "that the work
of salvage should begin at once and
that arrangements with the wrecking
companies which have the necessary
outfits should not be delayed. I deem
it proper to call attention to the fact
that Secretary Long, recognizing that
Congress is in session, has come here
for authority to do this work instead
of straining any authority he might
possess independently."
Bailey called attention to the fact
that the resolution only spoke of recov
ering the bodies, not of their return to
this country, but he added that there
need be no stickling on this point.
Boutelle replied that the Secretary
had referred in his letter to his duty in
that regard. He said he had just re
ceived a telegram from Secretary Long
this morning containing the latest in
formation from Captain Sigsbee, and
that it might be of interest to the
members.
"Read it! Read it!" came in chor
uses from the members, and Boutelle
then read the cable from Captain Sigs
bee, which had already been given
out by the Navy Department.
Sulzer (D.) of New York asked Bou
telle if he had any information other
wise that threw any light upon the
cause of the disaster.
"I must reply as I did yesterday,"
replied Boutelle, "that I regret to say I
have not. But all the information at
hand seems to strengthen the belief
that it was due to accident."
The resolution was then adopted
unanimously.

CONGRESS WILL
GIVE MORE CASH
FOR NEW SHIPS
That Will Be One of the Most
Important Results of the Awful
Disaster to the Battle
ship Maine.
NEW YORK, Feb. 18.â A Washington special to the Herald says:
What will be the effect of the Maine disaster upon the attitude of Con
gress toward making the appropriations for new ships is a question the
answer to which may depend largely upon what the naval investigation
shows to have been the cause of the wreck. Should it be shown that
the explosion which destroyed the ship came from without and was not
in any way due to any mishap inside the vessel, there is no doubt that
it will result in more liberal appropriations for new ships than would
be the case if it should be found that the explosion was due to an acci
dent on board the ship.
As might be expected, opponents of the navy would eagerly, seize
upon such an accident to argue that ships should not be built, if one of
them costing several millions of dollars is liable to be sent to the bot
tom by an explosion of her own magazines while she is lying quietly at
anchor.
Should it be shown that the explosion was not accidental, it is
quite probable that Congress, in the face of the strained situation
which would naturally result, would be ready in feverish haste to ap
propriate millions for the navy, and to authorize ships which ought to
have been built in former years so as to be ready for such an emerg
ency as might then be presented.
Friends of the navy in Congress are of the opinion that whatever
the cause of the disaster may have been they will be able. to secure
the passage of the naval appropriation bill containing provisions not
only for replacing the Maine by a much superior vessel, but for mak
ing at least a moderate increase in the number of ships authorized.
Representative Boutelle of Maine, chairman of the House Naval
Committee, declares positively that in his opinion the destruction of
the Maine, whether it was due to an accident or to a torpedo, should
not stop the enlargement of the navy.
"All information which has reached the Navy Department and
which I have seen," said Mr. Boutelle, "leads me to believe that the
destruction of the vessel was the result of an accident. If such should
be the case it may have an important effect upon members with refer
ence to authorizing an increase of the naval establishment. I am in
favor of an increase of the navy. The committee has not taken the
subject up as yet, but will do so in a few days, and will then express
its sense as to whether or not a report should be made to the House
authorizing the building of additional ships."

Governor Budd Speaks of

People of the State More Than Anx

the Nation.
Governor Budd and Adjutant-Gen
eral Barrett were at thf Palace Hotel
yesterday and listened to a deal of war
talk from active and retired officers of
the guard. The expression of opinion
brought out the fact that California in
the event of war would respond at once
with men and money to uphold the
honor of the nation.
The Governor, replying to some in
quiries on behalf of The Call, said:
"California stands ready to do her
duty. In the event of a declaration of
war I would tender the President of
the United States 10,000 men. If
money were needed to equip the troops
for immediae service. I would call
upon the rich and patriotic men of this
State to advance the funds until I
could convene the Legislature in extra
session to make the needed appropria
tion of the public money. Yes, I under
stand that Congress makes ample ap
propriations to reimburse money ad
vanced by the States for national de
fense. I would have no fear on that
point. California would receive back
from the General Government all the
money expended by the State in such
emergency."
The Governor fancied that California
regiments would be assigned to service
on this coast, yet the first two or three
regiments organized might be sent to
points on the South Atlantic if the
Government should require the imme
diate concentration of a large force of
men at some particular vital point.
"The troops would be sworn into the
service of the United States," said the
Governor, "and of course would be used
as the general commanding the army
should direct. It is natural to suppose
that the troops from Texas, Louisiana,
Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and
Georgia would stand the climate of
Cuba much better than would the
troops from the Northern or Pacific
Coast States. Then the cost of trans
portation and the element of time and
distance would cut a big figure in the
calculations for mobilizing an army.
I should say that California would be
depended upon to protect the coast
line of the Pacific. We have a long
stretch of seacoast and many regi
ments would be required to guard
against encroachment. I should say
that several regiments would be as
signed to duty in the harbor of San
Francisco, and that a force would be
needed at San Diego to strengthen the
garrison at that point.
"In the event of a declaration of war
and a call from the President of the
United States for each State to fur
nish a quota of men, the response of
California would be immediate. Cali
fornia would supply her quota instant
ly, and I should so Inform the President
at once. Should the Legislature be
convened in extra session no other sub
ject than that of providing means to
equip the troops and protect the State
would be embraced in the proclama
tion. Before the Legislature could as
semble I could raise the money to or
ganize the regiments on the faith â of
the State, which I should pledge. Cali
fornia stands ready to contribute men
and money to maintain the honor and
dignity of the nation. Our troops would
go wherever they wsro ordored, and I
am confident that in whatever position
placed they would reflect honor on the
. State and nation."

Overlooked.
Ex- Engineer Clark Fisher's
Conclusions as to an
Out3ide Explosion.
Portions of the Bottom of the Ship

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Feb. 18.â At Trenton
to-day Clark Fisher, late chief engineer
of the United States navy, said: "While
it is certain that the truth will be dis
closed upon the divers' examination,
one significant fact about the Maine's
destruction seems to have escaped no
tice. How did it happen that masses of
cement fell from above? One large
triangular piece came from above upon
the deck of the City of Washington of
sufficient size and force to pierce that
steamer's deck, and as stated in to
day's Herald, Lieutenant Blandin says
huge pieces of cement fell with grat
ings and other debris, a piece of ce
ment striking him on the head.
"Where did this cement come from
and how did it get there? The spaces
in the bottom of a ship, at its very low
est part and against the 'skin' of the
ship, are filled in with cement. The
projecting force upward must neces
sarily come from below this filling ce
ment. The only position below that
cement is the outside of the ship.
"Any internal explosion would neces
sarily come from somewhere above the
ship's bilges and must drive the ce
ment with the bottom of the ship down
ward."

CRUISER
VIZCAYA
ARRIVES
Now the BiÂ£ Spanish Ship
of War Is Outside
New York.
Met by the Herald=Call Tug and
the Officers Informed of
the Wrecking of the
Maine.
NEW YORK, Feb. IS.â Lieutenant J. G. Sobral. naval attache of
the Spanish Legation in Washington, was in this city to-day, actively
co-operating with the authorities in preparation for insuring the safe
ty of the Spanish battle-ship Vizcaya during her stay in this port.
Lieutenant Sobral, when asked for his opinion as to the cause of
the explosion on the Maine, replied: "I know the cause of the explo
sion, but I can't divulge it."
When questioned further on this point he finally replied: "It was
the result of an explosion inside the ship which took place in one of
the forward magazines. The fact of the matter is, that the discipline
and watch observed on the ship were very lax. This, as one English
newspaper the other day declared, is the case on American warships
generally. These sort of things have occurred on previous occasions
on American war vessels."
Regarding the possibility of serious trouble over the Maine affair he
said: "I do not think there will be war between the United States and
Spain, but if such an unfortunate condition should arise I shall, of
course, be in a position to be of much aid to my Government, as a re
sult of information which has come to my knowledge as naval attache
at the Spanish Legation. In the case of hostilities I might, perhaps,
command a ship."
NEW YORK. Feb. 18.â Spain's fine
armored cruiser Vizcaya rides at an
chor to-night, three miles west-north
west of Sandy Hook lightship. She
arrived at half-past 5 o'clock this aft
ernoon. All are well on board. Al
thought she had encountered tempestu
ous weather and for thirty-six hours
after noon Wednesday she fought her
way to port against seas piled up by
a terrific gale, when the Herald and
Call tug C. P. Raymond ran alongside
the cruiser at half-past 7 o'clock this
evening she loomed grim and forbid
ding-, a floating- fortress, shining in the
darkness. The sound of fantastic mu
i-\r and lively dancing floated from her.
Her Galician mariners were stepping
to the strains of the Gaita bagpipes of
the hillmen of Spain.
The tug's approaching lights had
4 ,n noticed, but the boat ran under
the towering bulwarks and frowning
guns without a challenge. At the re
porter's hail in Spanish a command
rang out from the officer of the deck.
The wailing Gaita was stilled and the
dancing ceased and across from the
Vizcaya's deck came the question:
"Who are you?"
"This is the New York Herald and
San Francisco Call tug. Are all well
aboard?"
"All well," was the reply, "officers
and men."
The officers formed a group at the
rail, and on either side of them hun
dreds of dark faces peered down at the
tug. which was lying under the visi
tor's guns.
"Have you heard of the blowing up of
the United States battleship Maine in
Havana harbor?" was asked.
"No," several cried in response. "Is
it true?"
A brief summary of the disaster was i
shouted, the officers hastily conferred, ;
and then were silent. It was learned
later that they knew of the De Lome j
incident. The graver news about the i
Maine they appeared to appreciate at j
its full gravity. They declined to dis
cuss it, saying courteously that they
could say nothing.
"The Spanish consul and doctor have
not been on board, so we cannot receive
the Herald reporter on the ship." they
said in reply to other questions in
Spanish.
Captain Eulate had not been one of
the group on deck, but the reporter
y was able to communicate to him the
news of the Maine disaster a few mo
ments later through the courtesy of
Daniel Gillespie, the Sandy Hook pilot,
who brought the cruiser to her anchor
age outside the bar. The pilot had
not heard of the disaster.
"Please tell the Captain of the loss of
the Maine."
"Do you think it is true?" the pilot
asked, horrified. He was told the coun
try had been grief-stricken for days
and that the news was all to authen
tic.
"I'm glad to hear it may have been
an accident," said the pilot, and then
he carried the story to the Vizcaya's
commander, who was already hearing
it from his officers. Captain Eulate
stepped on deck beside G'.llespie and
stood there silent.
"I have told him. He says he does
not believe it can be true," Gillespie re
ported.
The reporter communicated the latest
news from Madrid and told of the or
ganization of a court of inquiry. This
the captain heard in silence. He shook
his head slowly and said: "I cannot
dlpcuss it now."
Of Senor de Lome's resignation and
departure Captain Eulate also declined
to speak, saying simply that- he was
really not in port yet, and so officially
had not arrived at New York.
His consul and the health officers had
not been aboard, as he explained
through the pilot.
"How long will the Vizcaya remain
r In port?"
"That the captain is unable to tel,"
the pilot replied. "He will not know un
til he receives from the Spanish Consul
instructions now awaiting him here."
"Has he had no communication with
the shore yet?"
"None," the pilot replied. "You are
the first to speak the cruiser and bring
| the terrible news."
"When did they learn of Senor De
j Lome's resignation?"
"Only this morning when they picked
!me up," said Gillespie. "I carried
1 aboard a Herald of Monday, and they
; read tfie incident in it. But yours is the
first news they or I have heard of the
Maine."
"When will you come up?" was
asked.
"I'll take her up at daylight if it is
i clear enough then," the pilot said.
"Where will she anchor?" Captain
Eulate said to the pilot that he was un
certain about this point. "Probably off
Thirty-fourth street in the North
River," Gillespie replied, "but we won't
know for sure until the morning. Or
ders may be for Tompkinsville."
The reporter informed the officers of
! the banquet at Delmonico's, at which it
was intended they should be present.
They thanked him courteously for the
: information.
There was no music as the tug
i steamed away from the formidable
visitor. The news of the Maine's loss
had silenced the weird Gaita. The Viz
; caya's company was discussing it, offl
! cers and men alike, and all apparently
realized its sorrowful significance.
No craft lay at all near the Vizcaya
i last night. She was not visited by
I Government tugs or police boats de
tailed to guarantee her safety while in
port. They will give her safe conduct
; to-morrow morning when she enters
port. She was outside the bar to-night.
and so was left to herself. She will
move up the harbor at sunrise, and ac
' cording to naval etiquette observed the
world over will salute the first fort or
j battery she reaches with twenty-one
guns. In this instance it will be Fort
Wadsworth, and when she has run up
I the stars and stripes and thundered
her greeting the red and yellow banner
of Spain will climb the fort's staff and
| the salute will be returned.
Then will come the visit by the
Health Officer â a mere formality, for
; he will not go on board, but will simply
â  receive a report from the man-of-war's
i surgeon. The anchorage cutter Man
! hattan will run alongside the cruiser
after her guns are silent and will give
I her such aid as she may need in an
choring. Patrol-boats will at once take
up stations near the visitor.
When the vizcaya is at anchor Lieu
i tenant Dougherty, representing Rear
'â¢- Admiral Bunce, commandant of the
â¢ navy-yard, will go on board and ex
| tend to Captain Eulate and his officers
I the usual courtesies. He will also ex
: plain the presence of the patrol fleet.
! The Spanish Consul will convey to
: Captain Eulate instructions which
i have been awaiting him here, and will
, confirm the news of the Maine disaster,
communicated to the Spanish officers
by the reporter last evening.
Prominent Spanish residents will
visit the Vizcaya. The captain will
probably visit the navy yard in the
noon, returning the official call
j of Lieutenant Dougherty, representing
! Rear-Admiral Bunce.
The usual precautions have been
; taken by the Government authorities
! and Chief of Police McCullagh to pre
vent any possibility of any act of vio
| lence against the Vizcaya. Lieutenant
| Alexander Sharp Jr., U. S. N., who is
: attached to the office of Assistant Sec
| retary Roosevelt, visited police head
| quarters this morning, together with
; Ensign Paine, U. S. N., and Lieutenant
jJ. B. Sobral, naval attache of the
; Spanish legation at Washington. He
! had an Interview with Chief McCul
j lagh lasting for more than an hour.
; After they had gone the Chief said
their visit was to deliver a Kequest by
Rear-Admiral Bunce, commandant of
: the Brooklyn navy yard, that police
| men be detailed to act in conjunction
with the navy yard authorities for the
protection of the Vizcaya.
Chief McCullagh made public this let
ter, which he sent to the real admiral
in the morning:
"In compliance with your request I
have ordered Captain Elbert O. Smith
of this department, who is In com
mand of the steamboat Patrol, to fur
nish a detail of one roundsman and
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1898.
Spanish Cruiser Vizcaya off Fire Island Light.
four patrolmen to each tugboat as
signed by you to patrol the waters of
New York harbor in the vicinity of the
Spanish battle-ship Vizcaya. I have
arranged with Ensign Paine to estab
lish tours of patrol duty around the
vessel named as follows: Two tugs to
patrol in the vicintly for eight hours, to
be relieved by two tugs from the har
bor; these to be relieved in turn by
two steam launches from the Police
Department, thus establishing a pa
trol system during the entire twenty
four hours, the men assigned to such
service doing tours of eight hours on
and sixteen hours off; such force of
marines to be supplied to each boat as
in your judgment if necessary."
Chief McCullagh said: "The detail of
police will be under the command of
Captain Elbert O. Smith of the harbor
police, who will have sixty-seven men
assigned to him for duty. The police
steamboat patrol and six police
launches will be available for patrol
duty, and will work together with the
force from the navy-yard. I do not be
lieve, however, that there will be any
necessity for the use of the police, nor
for the force that is to be detailed from
the navy-yard for patrol duty. The
Vizcaya will be perfectly safe in New
York harbor, and the steps which are
being taken by the Government and the
police department are simply precau
tionary- The patrol will be kept up
every hour of the day and night w r hile
the Spanish ship is in this harbor, and
no craft of any description whatever
will be permitted to approach her un
less its mission is. fully explained to the
officer in command of the patrol. Just
how close the picket lines around the
warship will be drawn is a matter that
will be determined by the navy-yard
authorities."
WASHINGTON, Feb. 18.â "It would
be indefinitely worse for a Spanish
ship to be destroyed by American
treachery than for an American man
of-war to be destroyed by Spanish
treachery. In the latter case we could
hold up our heads and look the whole
world In the eye; in the former we
would hang our heads in shame."
This statement was made to me by
an official of the administration, speak
ing of the precautionary preparations
made by the Navy Department and by
the police of New York for the safety
of the Spanish armed cruiser Vizcaya.
Because of the possibility of some
fanatic making an attempt to destroy
the Vizcaya and because of the sug
gestion of such action by "yellow jour
nals," the War Department officials de
termined to take active measures for
protecting the vessel. Lieutenant Alex
ander Sharp Jr., naval attache to As
sistant Secretary Roosevelt, went to
New York under instructions from Mr.
Roosevelt, to confer with Rear Admiral
Bunce, commandant of the Brooklyn
navy-yard, and with the Chief of Police
in regard to providing adequate pro
tection for the Vizcaya and her crew.
It was recalled to-day that during
the Grant celebration a Spanish man
of-war dropped anchor In New York
harbor and that Mr. Roosevelt, then a
member of the New York Police Board,
took measures, at the suggestion of Mr
McAdoo, then assistant Secretary, to
protect the crew of the ship from in
sult and the vessel from destruction.
Notwithstanding these precautions, the
Spanish Minister was informed by the
commanding officer of the ship that
some of his men who had gone ashore
had been stoned by a band of hood
lums.
This matter was not brought to the
attention of the State Department sim
ply because Spain did not care to mag
nify the incident. It is expected that
the Vizcaya's commander will exercise
judgment in permitting his men to
land in New York, especially in view of
the Maine disaster. Rear Admiral
Bunce has been instructed to extend
every possible courtesy to the officers
and men of the Vizcaya.

SIDE DAMAGED

Places.
OppoÃite Side of the Wrecked Vessel
Seared and Torn by the
Explosion.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Feb. 18.â The World's
Havana cable says: (.'aptaln Sigsbee
and the local board <>f investigation
rowed to-day around and around the
sunken, sullen, twiste.! massesâ all that
is left of the splendid battle-ship
Maine. They could not get on board,
because of the orders of the authori
ties; at least, the guards said so, and
Captain Sigsbee obeyed, although his
pennant was still flying from the mast
head and parts of the Maine above
water (or below it, either) were just
as much "United States soil" as ever
they were.
The officers examined the position of
the wreck closely. It was noted, prim
arily, that the whole force of the ex
plosion was from port to starboard.
This is shown principally by the wnole
main deck between the after and for
ward and main magazines being blown
upward and over to starboard bodily.
The forward smokestack also was
thrown to starboard and aft. It now
lies farther aft than the rear funnel.
Other conclusive proofs that the ex
plosion came from the port side and
center of the ship are the facts that the
frail incandescent lampguards on the
starboard side am intact, while on the
port side everything is smashed, and
also that the paint on the starboard
side is still white and fresh, while that
on the port side is seared, vitrified and
blackened. The funnels nre smashed
*ln upon their port sides, which is con
clusive proof that the massive braces
which held the deck down on the port
side are stripped of their riveted plates.
The deck was thrown over solidly upon
the starboard braces. The wreck fur
ther has a general list to port, and im
mediately after the shock canted that
way.
The present inclination, therefore, is
not the result of uneven or gradual
settlings, but is final evidence that the
ship is practically broken in two by
the explosion against the port side. It
is regarded as marvelous that the rear
magazine did not explode also, as the
primary explosion came from the cen
ter of the ship midway between the
magazines. There was no* necessary
flooding of the magazines. The first
concussion probably loosened the doors
and they filled. There was nothing in
the forward magazine to go off on a
mere detonation. The gun cotton in the
rear magazine is yet intact.
The general opinion is that the for
ward magazines did not explode.
A SUBMARINE BOAT
TO VIEW THE WRECK.
The Argonaut Is Now Being Fitted
TJp at Baltimore to Be Taken
to Havana Harbor.
BALTIMORE, Feb. 18. âThe subma
rine wrecking boat Argonaut was towed
this evening from her moorings to the
yards of the Columbian Iron Works,
where she was built. Here her boilers
and machinery are to be thoroughly
overhauled, and when pronounced ab
solutely fit she is to be towed by the
John I. Brady of this city to Key West
and from there transported to Havana.
J. C. Lake, father of Simon Lake, the
inventor of the boat, says he has no
doubt the exact cause of the sinking of
the Maine could be learned by the use
of the Argonaut. The testimony of di
vers would not have to be relied upon,
he said, because the Government'scom
mission could be taken to the bottom
of Havana harbor, and by the use of
electric lights carried by the Argonaut
could see the exact condition of the
vessel's hull. All the expensive arma
ment not wrecked by the force of the
explosion could be recovered before the
action of the sea water ruined it.
Beet Fields Need Rain.
SALTNAS. Feb. 18.â P. W. Morse of the

that the prospects in this county are not

and Gilroy there is some lanrl that is wet
enough to raise n crop, and the Pajaro
Valley is all right, but in the Salinas
Valley the outlook is bad. Unless heavy
rains come soon the factory will not run
this year.

Vultures Wheel Above
the Wreck of the
Maine.
Divers Expected To- Day, When
Important Developments
May Be Expected.
Excitement Somewhat Cooled at
Havana Owing to the Scenes of
Mourning.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HAVANA, Feb. 18.â A revolting in
cident of the day has been the pres
ence of vultures wheeling in the air
above the wreck.
With Lieutenant-Commander Wain
wrlght. Lieutenant Holman and Chief
Engineer Howell, Captain Sigsbee
went on board the wreck this morning.
The big cat that was a pet of the
Maine's crew, and that was found yes
terday on the wreck so much fright
ened that it apparently had not moved
from its hiding place, is now on board
the Fern. The captain's dog, Peggy,
was also saved. The United States
divers are expected to-morrow.
Havana still mourns with the Ameri
can people. Since the funeral cere
monies of yesterday the city has re
moved the outward signs of grief, but
the work of succoring the living and
caring for the dead proceeds unremit
tingly.
Every care is shown the survivors.
General Blanco and the officials con
tinue to co-operate with Captain Sigs
bee and General Lee. The messages re
ceived from Spain and the United
States showing that the action of the
Havana authorities is appreciated, give
satisfaction to the officers, who are
making further efforts to ameliorate
the condition of the survivors.
There is sincere regret that circum
stances make it impossible to meet the
wishes of friends who desire that the
remains of their loved ones be sent
home for burial, but in cases where
the officers of the Maine deem it practi
cable necessary facilities will be
afforded.
The feeling of the community is that
social functions would be out of place
at a time of such mourning, and these
will be suspended for the present.
Statements from Madrid and Washing
ton published here to the effect that
many people in the United States be
lieve the explosion was accidental coin
cide with the opinion held by the Span
ish officials, and the excitement which
followed the disaster has subsided into
quiet waiting.
CONCENTRADOS MOURN
FOR THE AMERICAN DEAD.
Ask for Permission to Carry the
Bodies on Their Shoulders
to the Grave.
HAVANA, Feb. 17.â Previous to the
funeral of the victims of the Maine dis
aster a delegation from the concentra
dos expressed the wish to carry the
bodies on their shoulders to the grave
as proof of their gratitude to the Amer
icans, but General Lee thanked them
and said the bodies would be carried in
the manner selected by the authori
ties.
In front of the Albisu Theater, on
Reina and Belascoain avenues, about
400 concentrados Joined in the pro
cession, which had by that time been
increased by some 500 persons of all
classes. The procession did not reach
the cemetery until after 6p. m. There
the religious ceremonies were presided
over by Bishop Manuel Sanerand and
Father Chadwick, chaplain of the
Maine.
Big Order for Cartridges.
1 NEW YORK, Feb. 18.â An order for
3,000,000 Mauser rifle cartridges charged
with antiphrite powder has been placed
with a powder firm in this city by the
Spanish Government. The order was
given through a contracting agent, who
has so far managed t* conceal his
identity. The powder, as its name im
plies, is smokeless. It is used by the
Russian and German armies and Eng
land.
Another Cruiser for Havana.
NEW YORK, Feb. 18.â Late dis
patches from Washington announce
that the administration has decided
that another man-of-war should be
sent at once to Havana to replace the
Maine. The Montgomery will probably
be the vessel selected, and that vessel
will be in Havana harbor probably
Monday noon.

NEW YORK. Feb. 18.â The Herald*
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
There is no intention on the part of th'i
administration to permit the Spanish
Government to participate in any way
with the investigation into the Mama
disaster which will be made by this
Government. Neither is it proposed to
allow the Spanish Government to make
the first inquiry into the loss of the
Maine. The battle-ship is still part of
the American navy and as such is
American territory, and no one can ap
proach it without the sanction of the
President or his authorized representa
tives, who In this case are Secretary
Long and Captain Sigsbee.
I was told at the close of office hours
this afternoon that no dispatches had
been received from Captain Sigsbee
stating that the Spanish authorities
had instituted an investigation or that
he had been requested to appear before
a court of inquiry to give testimony
concerning the disaster. If he should
be asked the department will un
doubtedly instruct him to decline such
an invitation.
"Such action on the part of the' Spa
nish authorities," said an official to me
to-day, "would be without precedent.
would be unwarrantable and could
properly be considered as interferer.ee.
It is perfectly right that the Spanish
Government should make an inquiry,
but it would be manifestly improper for
American officers to appear before that
court, which speaks a strange lan
guage, and make statements which
might be distorted in translation into
evidence injurious to the case which
their Government might be desirous of
preparing."

that he believed Sarmann innocent of the

his post-mortem examination showed that
the woman had been criminally assaulted

Washington. Feb. 8.
Soon after the Senate met to-day
Hale of Maine introduced the following
joint resolution, which was slightly
amended, and adopted:
<fr "Resolved, That the Secretary <?>
<Â£ of the Navy be and is hereby <$>
& authorized to engage the ser- â¦
4> vices of a wrecking company or 4>
â¦ companies having proper facili- <?â¢
â¦ ties for the prompt and efficient <Â§>
â¢2> performance of submarine work <Â£
<Â£ for the purpose of raising the â¢Â§>
remains of the officers and men â¦
<Â£> lost on the United States steam- <$â 
â¦ ship Maine and of saving the Â«3>
<3> vessel, or such parts thereof, and <Â£
<?> such of her stores, guns, mater- <S>
â¦ ial, equipment, fittings and ap- <$>
<fc purtenances as may be practica- <Â§>
â¦ ble, and for this purpose the sum <$â¢
â¦ of $200,000 or so much thereof as <S>
â¦ may be necessary is hereby ap- <S>
*Â£ propriated and made immediate- <?â¢
4> ly available." <S>
The resolution was prepared at the
request of Secretary Long, who, in for
warding it to Hale, also sent a letter
explaining its purpose. He says in this
letter "it is deemed proper and im
portant that steps should be taken im
mediately to raise the remains of the
officers and men lost on the occasion of
the most deplorable catastrophe; to
raise the vessel or to save such parts
of her armament and equipment as
may be practicable." To this the Sec
retary adds:
The Secretary inclosed a table show-
Ing the cost of a number of items of the
ordnance outfit of the vessel, aggregat
ing $502,152.
Allen thought it very desirable that
a provision be inserted in the resolution
for the transportation and burial of the
remains of those who lost their lives
in the disaster.
Hale called attention to the fact that
reference was made to the transporta
tion of the bodies in the letter of the
Secretary of the Navy. In many cases,
he said, it would be impossible to bring
to this country the remains of the men
killed, as the bodies were so badly mu
tilated and the facilities for embalming
80 inferior in Havana, that already the
remains c-f many of the dead were de
composing, and it would be necessary,
probably, to bury them at once.
Mason hoped that provision would be
made for the transportation of the
bodies to the United States and for
their burial in this country. To that
end he proposed an amendment to the
resolution as follows:
"After the word 'thereof and before
the word 'and' insert the following:
"And for the transportation and
"burial of the remains of the officers
and men so far as possible."
The amendment was agreed to, and
the resolution, as amended, was passed.
The resolution offered yesterday by
Allen of Nebraska directing the Com
mittee on Naval Affairs to make an in
vestigation of the disaster to the Maine
was then laid be/ore the Senate. It
precipitated the most furious debate.
Chandler of New Hampshire thought
that if the word "immediate" be strick
en out and the matter be left within
the discretion of the committee there
would be no objection to the resolution.
Mason if Illinois proposed an amend
ment striking out all after the word
"resolved" and Inserting the following:
"By the Senate and House of Repre
sentatives concurring, that a joint
commltteee of five, consisting of three
members of the House of Representa
tives and two members of the Senate,
be appointed to investigate the disaster
to the battle-ship Maine:"
Mason followed Hale in a speech re
plete with sensational utterances. He
said In beginning that he had no dis
position to inflame a situation already
so exciting, but he felt that his substl

THE GOVERNOR ORDERS
A DAY OF MOURNING.
Governor Budd was in San Francisco yesterday, accompanied by
Adjutant-General Barrett. He met quite a number of citizens during
the day, and thÂ» talk naturally turned to the great disaster to the
battle-ship Maine in the harbor of Havana.
The Governor was so much impressed by a suggestion from THE
CALL that some public tribute of respect should be pai J to the memory
of the American offi.ers and sailors whose lives were sacrifkel at
Havana that he decided to proclaim Monday, February 21, as a day for
public expression of sympathy. Accordingly this proclamation was
issued by the chief executive of California:
EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT, STATE OF CALIFORNIA, FEB. 18, 1898
Citizens are requested ani officers in charge of State buildings and
armories are directed to place the flag at half-mast on Moniay, Febru
ary 21, 1898, out of respect to the memory of those officers and men of
the warship Maine who lost their lives through the late lamentable dis
aster to that vessel in the port of Havana, Cuba.
JAMES H. BUDD, Governor.
By the Governor: L. H. BROWN, Secretary of State.
By WILLIAM T. SESNON, Deputy.
tute was fully justified by the feelings
and desires of the people.
,"I understand," said he, "that the
Navy Department is making an inves
tigation of the disaster, but I also un
derstand that Congress has the author
ity to make an investigation. It is a
congressional investigation that people
are demanding. They are fast coming
to the conclusion that matters concern
ing this Cuban affair, including the De
Lome letter incident, and the loss of
the Maine, of which they ought to
know, are being concealed from them.
The people want to know the facts,
and they will know them."
Mason said he did not desire to re
flect upon the motives or honor of any
body, but he suggested that the offi
cials of the Navy Department, in mak
ing the investigation would foe trying
their own case, and -would naturally
endeavor to cover up any blame that
might attach to them.
"The trouble with us is," declared
Mason, with great vehemence, "that we
have adopted the Spanish policy of
putting everything off until to-morrow.
Let the investigation of this disaster
to our navy and to our country be
thoroughly investigated by Congress
and thcr. we shall know that it will be
done right."
Hale Interrupted Mason to make a
statement.
Replying, Mason said there was no
calamity so great as a failure on the
part of those in power to appreciate
the situation, when it was so serious
as it now is, and no sorrow so profound
as that of indifference to this situation.
He was surprised that Hale would ad
mit the occasion was a salemn one.
surprised that the Maine Senator would
admit that anything, any occurrence,
in Cuba was of a solemn character.
He had no desire to stir up trou
ble, but would only insist, as he has
done before, upon the stopping of
human slavery and inhuman war
fare in this adjacent island.
He had a letter from Julian Haw
thorne, read to show, as he claimed,
that murder was the policy of the
Spanish Government in Cuba. He also
had De Lome's letter read, and as
serted that the late Minister had been
defended in the Senate until he had
confessed out of his mouth that auto
nomy was a fraud, and that he was
the author of the letter quoted. This
plea of autonomy had been used to se
cure delay oh the part of the admin
istration's interference of affairs in
Cuba, and it was for this reason that
Mason said he wanted an immediate
report upon his resolution for inter
vention. In view of De Lome's con
fession there was no use for delay.
Autonomy he denounced as a sham, a
fraud and a delusion, and the De Lome
letter only served to emphasize the
treacherous character of the Spaniard.
As for himself, he would not, if
eligible, be willing to serve on
the proposed committee, as he
would not want to sit at the
table with a Spaniard who
might have a stiletto under his
clothes, unless he himself was iron
clad. The record of the Spanish
nation, continued Mason, who ap
peared to be laboring under consid
erable excitement, is one of contin
uous treachery, and we have exper
ienced that treachery in our own
history for the past hundred years.
It had been made evident that the

Spaniard could not be trusted in any
capacity, and for this reason we
should now have American divers
investigating the hull of the Maine
and not be depending upon those of
an unfriendly power.
"We are told," he said, "that the
naval board may be able to reach
Havana by next Monday.
"Manana," he exclaimed, "means
to-morrow â always to-morrow. That
is the Spanish motto, and we are
falling into it."
In the meantime who knows but
t that some more dynamite will be
: put in and evidence of the catas
trophe averted?
Mason had scarcely taken his seat
! when Wolcott addressed the chair
'â¢Mr. President," he said, and the
words shot forth like a bomb to be ex
ploded in the Senate. It was evident
from the Colorado Senator's counte
i nance and manner, to say nothing of
the intensity of his voice, that he was
laboring under considerable feeling. He
had listened to Mason with ill-con
| cealed feeling of emotion, his face
j growing redder and his brows more
, and more like a thunder cloud as the
Illinois Senator proceeded. He spoke
with great rapidity and occupied only a
'â â  few minutes of the Senate's time, re
| fusing to be interrupted and speaking
very sharply when Mason sought to
| divert him. Wolcott spoke as follows:
"Mr. President: The Senator from Il
linois, however inopportune it may be
at this time, in the opinion of some of
j us, might well have been permitted to
1 ass without comment, had it not been
for the remarkable utterance which he
j has given to the fact that the people of
these United States have lost confl
j dence in one of the great departments
! of the Government."
Mason had resumed his standing po
â¢ sition and he Interrupted to say that
| the Senator from Colorado was entirely
i mistaken. .
"I made no such statement," he said.
Wolcott â I decline to be interrupted.
I I ask to have the remarks read from
| the reporter's notes."
Mason â I said that some people were
: losing confidence in one department
i and â "
Wolcott then continued. The Senate
would, he said, bear him out that he
did not misquote the Senator from Il
linois to the extent pf a single word or
a single syllable. Resuming, he said:
"Mr. President, from the time of
Paul Jones until now our ships have
sailed in every war, face always to
the foe. The records of our naval
battles are the most glorious his
tory in the page of our country for
the last one hundred years, and
from the earliest days until now
there has never been a step back
ward. To-dayyt as always, the of
ficers of our navy are honorable,
courageous, upright men, and above
all, they tell the truth. The captain
of this ill-fated battle-ship was
walking his deck at 10 o'clock on
the night of the 15th, when this
awful explosion happened. It may
bo that his public career is ended
forever, but the awful disaster that
overtook his ship will count for
nothing by comparison with the de-
graded insinuation made here that
an officer of our country, with the
oath and with the flag above him,
would lie and cast responsibility
where it did not belong.
"Ah, Mr. President, war is grim
decision, and when it conies it must
come so that the people ot the world,
whether they flight with us or not,
can at least respect our conduct and
our position, and above all, Mr.
President, it must come under cir
cumstances which make us respect
ourselves."
Wolcott was followed immediately by
Lodge of Massachusetts, who had sat
very restless under Mason's reflections
on the Navy Department. He also
spoke with intense earnestness, saying:
"Mr. President, I have no desire and
lio intention of saying one word in re
gard to the war which is raging in
Cuba. No one could detest the horrors
enacted in that island more than I. No
one desires more than I to see the
Spanish power swept from that island,
as it has been from all the States of
South America, but, Mr. President,
that question is not here. We are face
to face at this moment with a great na
tional calamity. The Americans have
received the awful news of the sinking
of the warship Maine with a splendid
silence and self-restraint, both in Con
gress and throughout the country.
They are waiting sternly, quietly, to
know the truth, and the truth they
will have. This is not a question
which involves Cubans or Spaniards.
This is a question which involves brave
American seamen, gone to their death
in a foreign port. In the presence of
that calamity what we want is the
truth. How are we to get it? By the
investigations of a committee of Con
gress which knows nothing, which has
no witnesses to summon, which has no
expert knowledge, which is miles from
the place where the disaster occurred?
'â¢There is only one way to get at the
truth of this matter, and that Is
through the naval officers who have
been selected already to perform that
duty. Can any one suppose that the
naval officers of the United States, men
on whose careers in the past and whose
conduct in the present there Is not
and never has been a blemish, would
seek to conceal the facts in such a case
as this? I would rather trust this in
vestigation to the officers of the Ameri
can navy than tv any other men in the
country. Does any one suppose that
the captain of that ship, who, wounded,
stunned by the explosion, remained
until the last upon the sinking vessel,
and who, in the midst of that awful
terror and excitement, with every duty
nobly done, sent a dispatch to this
country showing a coolness and a nerve
which are an honor to the American
name â does any one suppose that Cap
tain Sigsbee, capable of such splendid
conduct, is going to lie about his ship?
The Secretary of the Navy is a man of
distinguished ability, honor and of
patriotiFm. If any one imagines that
Secretary Long will not tell the truth,
and insist upon tho whole of it, he little
knows the character of the man who
has the honor to till that great post at
the head of the navy, and 1 for one
trust that Congress will await the ac
tion of the pmper department charged
with this inquiry, and will not attempt
to do anything which could in the least
degree "derogate from the attitude
which the American people and Con
gress should hold in the presence of a
calamity so dire and so- tragic as that
which befell the battleship Maine.
"1 think those who know Hon. Theo
dore Roosevelt, who is Mr. Long's
right-hand man, would be slow to be
lieve that he would ask to conceal the
truth in regard to this disaster. Mr.
President. I am sorry that any debate
has arisen on this question. It seem 3
to me that the attitude of Congress
ever since the awful news arrived has
been in the highest degree dignified
and worthyâ worthy of itself and wor
thy of the American people. We have
not speculated or talked.
"We have waited in a silence of
much deeper meaning than any
words. We wr.nt to know the truth.

the Maine then let us provide so far

GENERAL AROLAS, Military Governor of Havana.
UNDOUBTEDLY DUE
TO A TORPEDO
Captain Brice, a Retired Naval
Officer, Has a Positive Opinion
as to the Loss of the Maine.
WASHINGTON, Feb. IS.â Captain John J. Brice, a retired naval offi
cer, in speaking about the explosion on the Maine, gave the positive
opinion that it was caused by a torpedo. He said he thought the inves
tigation would prove this to be true, and that a torpedo was lowered
by men in a boat and suspended from the anchor chain or cable some
feet below the bow, and that torpedo was exploded by wires.
"From a professional point of view," he said, "there is no theory
that will bear out the supposition of an accident. Yet the suspicion of
a crime so heinous would be so unjust, if not true, that it would al
most equal the crime. I am sure, however, the whole matter will be
laid before us in a few days like an open, book and the truth abso
lutely known. If the explosion was from the outside the undulation of
the plates will be in-board. and to the CG-ntrary if from the outside. The
wires, if any, doubtless will be picked up, and many other indications
will be found if the explosion is from the outside. I think the vessel's
plates will show in-board from the bow and outward from the back, for
the detonation from the explosion of the torpedo evidently caused the
explosion in the magazine, which caused a second explosion. The only
thing I cannot account for is the smoke and fire. This could not come
from a torpedo alone, and hence I believe the shock caused the explo
sion in the magazine or elsewhere and gave rise to the flames."
recurrence. If it was treachery,
then the righteous wrath of the
American people will take a signal
vengeance for the treachery that
sent the ship to the bottom, and let
no one think to stay it."
Mason replied: "Misquotation and
general spaem will not drive me from
the decision of this question in the Sen
ate."
He shared, he said, in the general ad
miration of the various departments
of the executive branch of the Govern
ment, and Wolcott would not excel him
in that respect. "I am sorry," he said,
"that while the Colorado Senator is
giving us such a lecture about the Navy
Department he does not slop over and
give the Treasury Department some of
his praise."
He (Mason) fully indorsed all that
Lodge had said about the head of the
navy, with whom he had served in the
House, and whom he knew to be a man
of ability, of great head and a warm
heart. But. Mr. Long could not himself
object to an investigation, and it was
no part of friendship to him to try to
shield him from such an inquiry as was
proposed. If he himself were managing
the department, he would, under the
circumstances, want the investigation.
He denied that his remarks contained
any reflection upon Mr. Long's integ
rity or honor, or the integrity or honor
of the officers of the navy. But, while
this was true, he also had regard for
the honor and the lives of the common
seamen. He also resented the intima
tion that he had gone into the slums to
find words with which to characterize
the Navy Department, and repeated
his loyalty to the navy and other de
partments.
"I have an unmitigated dread of
war," said Hawley of Connecticut with
great feeling, "and I deprecate all war
talk. Do the gentlemen who talk so
loudly of war think we are ready for
war? They cannot know certainly
what it means."
Allen of Nebraska said he desired to
secure a vote upon the resolution, but
he desired to reiterate the suspicions
expressed by Mason, that the investi
gation by the Navy Department would
not be satisfactory to the country
"Can the Senator give the grounds
for his suspicions?" inquired Gray of
Delaware. "His statement is import
ant."
"My statement is Important," replied
Allen. "I want to say that I have not
in my five years' experience In the
Senate known one of these investiga
tions to result in anything."
Hale rose and said deliberately: "I
decline absolutely to follow the Sena
tor from Illinois (Mason) into a gen
eral discussion of the Cuban question.
I had hoped that this subject might be
disposed of to-day without debate, and
now decline to take advantage of the
melancholy situation to exploit my
self. 1 have here a dispatch received
by the Navy Department from Cap
tain Sigsbee. It shows that there is
not in the city of Havana a single dis
cordant note. All are in mourning for
the dead. The city is filled with an
atmosphere of pity, commiseration and
sympathy."
Hale remarked that under the rules
the resolution would go to the calen
dar.
Pending a motion by Hale that the
Senate go into executive session, Bacon
of Georgia introduced the following
joint resolution:
"That there shall be prepared under
the direction of the Secretary of the
Navy and placed on the wall of the
Statuary Hall in the Capitol building
a bronze commemorative of the officers
and men of the United States navy
who perished in the loss of the battle
ship Maine in the harbor of Havana,
February 15, 1898. The said tablet
shall contain the names of said officers
and men and shall be an enduring me
morial to their honor and a perpetual
token of the sorrow of the nation."
The resolution further appropriated
a sufficient sum of money to carry the
resolution into effect. It was referred
to the Committee on Naval Affairs.
At 2:05 p. m. the Senate went into
executive session. At *:53 the Senate
resumed business in open sesion for the
purpose of considering resolutions oyi
the death of the Hon. Ashley B.
Wright, late a Representative from
Massachusetts. At 3:40, as a further
mark of respect, the Senate adjourned
until Monday next.

diver who examines the bottom
of the battle-ship Maine finds a
hole in the bow beneath the
water line which has a bulge
outward, they will know instant
ly that the vessel was the vic
tim of an outside attack."
Thus spoke Major J. W. Riley, com
mander of the Watertown arsenal, to
day. This statement, uttered by an
officer of the United States army, who
is in a position to know the workings
of all modern implements of war, is
Important at this time, while the ex
act cause of the disaster is still a
matter of speculation. An open state
ment emanating from a Washington
naval official claimed that, if an investi
gation revealed a bulging around the
outside of the alleged hole, it would
prove conclusively that the Maine had
been wrecked by an interior expios/on.
This impressions seems to be alto
gether at variance with established
facts in the history of efficient armor
plate tests which have been held under
various conditions. At the Watertown
arsenal, where ordnance of all descrip-^f
tions is manufactured, the officers in
charge of the various departments scoff
at the idea of an interior explosion
causing a bulge on the outside of a
steel plate, such as was carried by the
Maine.
"The whole matter will be cleared up
in the official investigation," said Ma
jor Riley, as he glanced over some
armor plate drawings. "Any man fa
miliar with the effect of either torpe
does or projectiles upon heavy armor
or plates will know the moment he
looks at the hole, if hole there is,
whether or not the boat was destroyed
by an interior explosion or by an at
tack from the outside.
"This bulge, which the papers say
may be on the outside of the hole, and
which they claim may be the result of
an interior disruption, can only be
found on the side of the armor plate
against which the mplement of at
tack strikes. It is just the. same as
though you were to hit a tub of water
with your open hand. When a tor
pedo strikes a piece of armor plate It
causes the plate to spread outwardly,
the torpedo not exploding until by the
force of its projection it has eaten its
way several inches through the steel."
"Could a torpedo exploding in the
interior of the vessel cause such a hole
as is reported exists in the hull of the
Maine?" was asked.
"Why, no. How could it? If a tor
pedo exploded the whole side and bot
tom of the ship would have been blown
to pieces, while on the other hand
either a projectile or torpedo could cut
a clean hole below the water line and
the bulge would be found on the out
side, while the inside sheet of the plate
would be torn and jagged."
Another well known authority on
Government ordnance and its modern
application is Captain Frank B. Hobbs,
who is also stationed at the Watertown
arsenal. Captain Hobbs was formerly
in charge of the Government armor
plate department at the Bethlehem
Steel Works at Bethlehem, Pa., and
his opinions on the question at issue
bears considerable weight. When asked
what he thought of the theories ad
vanced on the probable cause of the
hole, and whether a bulge would be
of inward or outward nature Captain
Hobbs said: "It must be taken into
consideration that modern battle-ships
are not entirely covered with armor;
only the vulnerable points exposed to
the enemy are given this additional
protection.
"Now in case of an explosion occur
ring in the bow of the vesel such as is
reported, the result would be, to my
thinking:, that the sides or bottom of
the boat would have been ripped
apart."
"Would a torpedo tear a plate off or
would it cut a hole through, supposing
that it struck from the water side?"
was asked.
"An outside attack would bore a hole
through the plate," replied Captain
Hobbs, "and it would cause the steel
to bulge on the water side; then the
explosion would tear the back out of
the plate, leaving the outside almost
free with the exception of the marked
bulge."
Captain Hobbs also said that it
would take but a few hours to plant a
mine from a harbor to any point in
sight, but as for aiming a torpedo un
der water at any vessel in a harbor, he
did not think it would prove much of a
success.BEFORE DISHONOR THERE WILL COME WAR
PLENTY OF
GROUND FOR
SUSPICION
Secretary Long Pre=
mature in Urging
Accident Theory.
Spaniards Are Charged Too
Openly With Treachery
for Public Opinion to Be
Held in Check.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Feb. IS.
. No new disclosures were made to-day
tending to fix the responsibility for the
explosion on the Maine, but Secretary
Long said he is convinced that it was
an accident. v
No importance is attached to the
threatening: circular handed to Captain
Sigsbee several days ago and published
in several papers this morning. It is
such a missive. Secretary Long thinks, !
as is found in the mails of the Presi
dent and high officials every few days,
and indicates nothing more than that ;
another irresponsible crank has been
heard from. The Navy Department
feared the effect of publication on the
sentiment of Congress and took steps
to counteract it this morning by fresh
statements attributing the Maine dis
aster to an accident. The opinion of
Mr. Alger, an expert, was given out by
the department to show that a torpedo
could not have done the work.
The President is ready to send "* to i
Congress his information concerning
the situation in Cuba, It was laid be
fore the Cabinet to-day. It is not im
probable that definite, action by Con
gress will follow. The President was
urged to withhold it for the present in
view of the public excitement.
There were no new or important mes
sages from any official in Havana to
lay before the Cabinet at its session to
day. The only message of any kind
was that of Captain Sigsbee telling of I
the funeral of the dead seamen of the
United States.
The Cabinet convened at the usual
hour and was in session less than the
usual time. Secretary Long stated that
the official body headed by the Presi
dent had nothing to discuss, and that
. there were no developments. He em
phatically denied many of the sensa
tional stories now afloat, some of which
have obtained publication. One of
these is that there have been secret
sessions of the Cabinet, and another is
that telegrams have been received and
sent which have been suppressed.
The Secretary said that he had sup
pressed nothing of any kind. The only
special session of the Cabinet to talk
over the disaster, he said, was on
Wednesday. It is further denied that
the President has talked with army
and navy and congressional people to
ascertain the condition of the fighting
forces of the country and to find out
how quickly consent to a war loan
could be obtained from Congress. An
important statement made by Secre
tary Long, however, was that in the
course of time another warship will be
sent to Havana.
"How long will be regarded as proper
before this step is taken?" the Secre
tary was asked.
The reply was that the time cannot
now be fixed. The Secretary did not
care to further discuss this point. Dur
ing the session the President ordered
that a bouquet of flowers be cut from
the White House conservatory and
sent to Mrs. Sigsbee, wife of Captain
Sigsbee. This was done, and Ensign
Kattelle, son-in-law of Captain Sigs
bee, was sent for to receive them.
The President has not forgotten the
brave seamen who were killed. He
gave orders that the families of any
.'. of the dead seamen residing in Wash
ington be sent bouquets. He did not
~ know the names of Washingtonians
who were sacrificed, and instructed
that they be looked up.
Comment is caused among Congress
men by the fact that ti. : Navy De
partment through every utterance
which has official sanction is en
: deavoring to allay suspicion that the
"blowing up of the Maine was the re
. suit of. foul play. Particularly active
â¢ efforts in that direction are being made
- : ; to-day. In the opinion of Congress
: rijen who are reserving Judgment until
â ~. the facts are known, the attitude of
" :: the Secretary is liable to prove embar-
V rassing, and official or semi-official ex
â " jpressiona of opinion should be re
; -served. In a semi-official way, they
â  "say, the Secretary has already passed
â¢â¢judgment on a case which a court of
. â¢ inquiry has been appointed to investi
â  gate, and the investigation of which
I- has not yet begun.
â¢â¢..-â¢â¢ Should that court secure evidence
â¢.'.which circumstantially leads to the
conclusion that the Maine was de
stroyed by design it is believed that
""â this country would be very seriously
' embarrassed by the arguments already
-j.. nnnn Â» K^r tVio ricnartniPTit tn rnn
vince the public that the explosion was
accidental.
Dispatches from Havana announce
that the Spanish authorities in Cuba
have designated officers to make an in
vestigation jointly with the American
officials as to the cause of the disaster.
The Spanish will probably make a pri
vate as well as this public investiga
tion Their taking this precaution rec
ognizes that the circumstances of the
explosion warrants suspicion, and this
action is one of self-defense against
the possibility of a biased report by
American officials. It is a foregone
conclusion that no matter what the
American board of inquiry may , dis
cover, the report of the Spanish offi
cials will be that the explosion was ac
cidental. In the event of a contrary
report by the court of inquiry appoint
ed by Admiral Sicard, the contention
of the Spanish authorities will be sus
tained and that of our own officials dis
credited.
The Congressional critics say, ,by the
declarations which are emanating from
the Navy Department, that It is pre
judicial Jiie -case. J,t,jfl held, .fcy a lliem
that a mistake is being made by the
administration in not maintaining an
absolutely neutral attitude. This mis
take is, they say, the more apparent
from the fact that the accident theory
advanced by the Secretary and by in
ference with semi-official authority,
is not the universally held theory In
the department, and is disputed by
very eminent authority. The fact is
that it is not known what caused the
disaster.
Individuals are at liberty to speculate
on the matter as much as they please,
and to support their theories by such
facts, scientific or otherwise, as they
can. but it is felt to be unwise for the
administration tv go further than to
express the hope, which is entertained
by everybody, that the explosion was
not the result of foul play.
The department is blamed for issuing
a typewritten opinion and argument by
Professor Alger, seeking to prove that
the explosion cc-uld not have been
caused by a torpedo, and that it was
the result primarily of an explosion in
the magazines. It criticized dispatches
from Havana, after stating that torpe
does might have been planted under the
Maine, and stated that "all this, how
ever, is regarded as being unlikely to
occur, as being almost impossible to
occur without the collusion of Spanish
officials." The idea of the collusion of
Spanish officers, even on their individ
ual responsibility, is shunned by every
body.
A fact, however, which has been
overlooked in the discussion of this
question is, that before the matter
came close home to us, there was no
hesitancy about charging the Spanish
officials and the Spanish Government
with atrocities quite as savage, brutal
and treacherous as the blowing up of
the Maine.
These charges have been made, not
only in the press, but in the most de
liberately- considered speeches and reso
lutions in Congress, and have been re
ferred to by the President in a mes
sage to Congress. It is held that, while
these charges, publicly made and often
repeated, do not warrant the assump
tion that any Spanish official, even in
his private capacity, would connive at
such a horrible deed as the treacher
ous destruction of an American battle
ship, yet the fact that such atrocities
were charged in good faith
does not warrant the assumption that
such a thing is possible, and suggests
the withholding of judgment until the
facts are known. The purpose of the
administration to prevent as far as
possible the hasty forming of a pub
lic opinion adverse to Spain is ap
proved by the best men in official life
in Washington, but an official assump
tion, in the face of expert testimony to
the contrary, that the explosion was
accidental is regarded as unwarranted
and unwise. It is not regarded as "re
serving" opinion.
CAPTAIN SIGSBEE'S
LATEST REPORT.
| Promises to Maintain the Official
Character of All Work About
the Wreck.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 18.â The Naval
Department to-night received the fol
lowing: message from Captain Sigsbee:
"With General Lee and Cowles to
day visited Captain-General Blanco
and other chiefs of civil and military
branches of Government and returned
thanks for great demonstration of sym
pathy yesterday and for their con
tinued care for the dead and for other
good offices now being exercised in our
behalf. Received additional assur
ances of sympathy and desire to help.
Spanish authorities feel situation
acutely. I have promised to maintain
official character of all work done on
wreck of the Maine. No friction any
where. SIGSBEE."
The reference to the official character
of the work is interpreted at the Navy
Department that no divers hired by
newspapers will be allowed to investi
gate the wreck. As to the published
statement that Spain intends to claim
a joint interest in the work of the court
of inquiry the department says under
the harbor regulations of any civilized
port the local authorities are bound to
make an official investigation of any
wreck occurring in their jurisdiction,
irrespective of the nationality of the
vessel or of any investigation by an
other Government, in the case it is a
craft owned by a foreign power. As the
matter is understood here this is the
only right Spain claims in the case and
it is conceded to be entirely fair. This
statement of the case was confirmed at
the Spanish legation.
A message was received this after
noon that the Coast Survey steamer
Bache, with divers and apparatus
aboard, had sailed from Tampa for
Havana.
PREPARING FOR

PRUDENCE
AND PATIENCE
THE POLICY
President and Cabinet
Await an Official
Investigation.
Secretary Long Pretends to
Believe the Fearful Loss
of Property and Life
Was Accidental.
NEW YORK, Feb. 18.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Patience
and prudence continue to characterize
the conduct of the President and his
advisers in dealing with the Maine
disaster. The President has no desire
to unduly force the conclusion upon the
public that the dire calamity in Ha
vana has been or was the result of an
accident, but until there is evidence to
the contrary he trusts and believes that
Judgment will be suspended by all fair
minded people.
The confidence felt by the adminis
tration that the disaster suffered by the
late second-class battle-shi.i> Maine was
the result of an accident is shown both
by the conservative opinion expressed
to-day by Secretary Long and by or
ders which have been issued to naval
ships.
After carefully considering all the In
formation which has come to hand, and
after a discussion of the subject which
occurred at the Cabinet meeting this
morning, the Secretary authorized an
interview late this afternoon, in which
he said: "Really, no information has
been received since Captain Sigsbee's
first dispatch, adding to our knowledge
of the disaster. All we know is that the
Maine blew up. There is abundant
room for speculation of all sorts, but no
conclusion can be arrived at until an
examination has been made by the
divers and more facts obtained.
"It is a simple act to say that such
a thing might happen by design or it
might happen by accident. As yet there
is no indication \>t design. Therefore,
my impression has been all along, and
I rather think the general opinion pre
ponderates In the same direction, that
it must have been accidental.
"At the Cabinet meeting to-day the
matter was not discussed, except as
any body of men talk about an event
of that kind, and most of that talk re
lated to the terrible loss of life and to
expressions of sympathy for the suffer
ers. It certainly was a very kind
thought in the President to send flow
ers to the families of Captain Sigsbee,
of the Executive Officer Wainwright
and of the lost seamen whose resi
dences are in Washington.
"There has been no secret Cabinet
meeting, and nothing has taken place
in the Cabinet that the public has not
been informed about. The whole policy
of the department has been to give the
public all the dispatches. The depart
ment has no more knowledge on the
subject of the cause of the disaster or
even of the circumstances attending it
than has the public, and the report to
the effect that Captain Sigsbee had
warned the department that the
Maine was in danger from submarine
mines or torpedoes is utterly without
foundation, no such report ever hav
ing been received from him or from
anybody else."
I was informed authoritatively to-day
that Secretary Long had not asked for
the opinion of Captain Sigsbee as to
whether the vessel's loss was due to
accident or design, nor will he do so.

llt Is recognized by the Secretary a*
I well as by other officials of the depart
! ment that Captain Sigsbee is in aÂ»
i measure on trial, and that he will be
I held responsible should it be shown,
i that carelessness was responsible for*
; the Maine's destruction.
The board of officers appointed by
I Captain Sigsbee to make an investiga
tion has not been able, according t(y>
the latest advices from Captain Sigs
bee, to obtain the report of a diver aa
to the appearance of the ship's bot
, torn. The department will naturally
have to await the report of this board
i before it can reach any conclusion as
:to the cause of the accident. But even
! upon the finding of this board, the de
partment's decision will not be final. It
; will await with patience the report of
; the Sampson court of inquiry.
Upon the report of the court of mi
i quiry will depend the future course to
be pursued by the administration in
this whole matter. The court is ex
pected to commence the work of exam
1 ining the officers and enlisted men of
the Maine at Key West either to-mor
row or Monday, and then go to Havana
to continue its investigation on the
ground. Secretary Long said the court
i would go to Havana either on the
; Olivette or the lighthouse tender Man
grove, and not on board of a man-of
war.
In anticipation of reports several
â¢ days ago indicating that the loss of the
| ship might have been due to an exter
nal cause, the department cabled to
St. Thomas directing the cruiser
] Brooklyn, which was expected there,
to remain until further orders.
There was some talk at that time of
I bringing the vessel to Key West. Sec
retary Long decided to-day, however,
to permit her to continue her cruise
1 to La Guayra, Venezuela, and a cable
\ gram was accordingly sent to her com
i mander. Captain C. F. Cook, late this
i afternoon, directing him to proceed to
; the Venezuelan seaport.
Besides the orders to the Brooklyn,
the department has determined tomob
ilize the North Atlantic squadron about
; February 25. Accordingly, instruc
tions have been given to the command
ing officers of the second-class battle-
I ship Texas, the cruisers Detroit and
Marblehead and the. gunboat Nashville
to start for Key West on February 23.
The Texas and the Nashville are at
1 Galveston, Texas, the Detroit at New
! Orleans and the Marblehead at Mo
i bile. Ala., attending the Mardi Gras
festival in progress at these points. A
department official, in talking to me to
night, said these vessels would* hardly
:be allowed to continue their stay at
: these points if the administration anti
cipated any immediate emergency.
Secretary Long confirmed, after the
Cabinet meeting to-day, the Herald's
| exclusive announcement this morning
> that a vessel would be sent to Havana
! harbor to replace the Maine. The ship
I selected will proceed to that port im
! mediately after the return of the sup
! ply ship Fern, which is expected to
; leave Havana harbor in two or three
I days for Key West. The vessel selected,
! according to the best information ob
j tamable to-day, would either be the
I cruiser Montgomery or the gunboat
I Nashville.

OUK SPECIAL NEWS SERVICE.
IN the excited condition of the public mind over the
destruction of the .Maine at Havana the popular
desire for news is intense. The people cannot
â¢wait for information to come to them in the ordinary
routine course of newspaper distribution, rapid as that
has become of recent years. Men throng around the
bulletin boards on the streets and each succeeding
dispatch relating to the catastrophe is read and dis
cussed with unabated ardor.
The Call recognizes in this emergency the need of a
prompter news service than usual and meets the de
mand with readiness. It supplies by its bulletin
boards in this city and throughout the State an un
ceasing stream of dispatches from all the principal
cities of the country giving reports of every event
that occurs in connection with the great issue, thus
keeping the people posted on the situation and in
close touch with all that is said or done in relation to
it by our officials at Washington.
Not by bulletins only, however, has The Call met
the demand for a swifter and better news service. It
has arranged a more rapid distribution of the paper
itself. On Friday morning it sent a special train to
the people of Sacramento, San Jose. VÂ» oodland and
points along branch lines connecting with these
routes. By these means The Call, with its full ac
counts of the latest reports and phases of the situa
tion, reached the readers of those places in time to
give them all the news long befoie other San Fran
cisco papers were received. At Sacramento the
earliest workers of the city were able to get The Call
before the work of the day began, and the great mass
of the people had the paper in time to read it at the
breakfast table.
What has been accomplished by these arrange
ments for the prompte-t possible publication of the
news and its distribution throughout the State is but
another illustration of the determination of The Call
to give the public the best newspaper service it has
ever had. The Call management recognizes the ear
nestness of the people on this important issue and
will be foremost in making known the news of all
that occurs in regard to it. By special bulletins, by
special trains and by all other means which can be
employed in reaching the public, not only of the city,
but of the interior. The Call will give the news, give it
reliably and give it first.
When a telephone or a phonograph is invented the
rext information invariably is that the contrivance
was in common use among the Chinese about 3000
years ago. The authenticity of such information is
never questioned, because it isn't there to question.
Now a grand scheme is under way to fittingly cele
brate the semi-centennial of California's admission.
Comes forward the Evening Post and without de
posing says it told about this last July. Well, it pro
duces evidence that it told about something and that
that something happened to be something else is a
matter 01 small import. The Post is in line for
helping- the celebration along, and if it find joy in
nurturing the belief that it was the first to fore
shadow the event nobody will begrudge it. Nobody
quarrels with the Chinese faith in the telephone
through which Confucius used to order coal or jaw
the gas man.
There are two newspaper men of New York who
are in the present emergency making monkeys of
themselves. We refrain from mentioning their
names because it is humane to treat even the- lower
animals with kindness, and a monkey may be sensi
tive.
The gentleman who rescued the Cisneros woman
has got into type again. That anything he may send
from near the seat of war will be regarded as a fake
goes without saying. Even were he to stumble upon
the truth he would cast it aside as unworthy of con
sideration.
With all respect to the administration, it is proper
to state that the people of this country are interested
in our relations with Spain. And while the people
are not all diplomats, the fact is that they will foot
the bills and do all necessary fighting.
There will be widespread regret at the death of
Frances Willard. She was a good woman, fixed in
her beliefs and faithful to the last to the duties she
had prescribed for herself and to interests for the
promotion of which she was peculiarly fitted.
If the Vizcaya were to be governed by good taste
she would defer her visit to this country. To pay her
the honors due a friendly man-of-war will be a severe
strain upon courtesy.
Weyler is being quoted. There seems no particu
lar reason for it. He is not an especially interesting
liar. ._ . v
A HOLF-CENTURY OF SHAME.
HE present relations" of. the United States and
7^ Spain have not been of the United States The
Spain have not been of sudden growth. The
' wreck of the Maine but cleared away the clouds
and left the hatred the Spanish feel for us exposed in
all its intensity: That this hatred should > be mixed
with contempt is our fault. By patient endurance of
the brutal insolence of Spain for half a century we
have well earned the disregard she is ever ready to
express. It is not the part of a great nation to pick
a quarrel with a weak one. Neither is it the part of
a great nation to forbear without limit when", it is
subjected to continued insults, its property destroyed,
its subjects mrtrdered, its â â  protests" made a laughing
stock and its flag derided as being no protection.
For half a century Spain has been permitted to do
with us as she pleased. At last she has the. idea that
we are cowards. How could she . have any other?
She thinks she could whip us. What has there been
to convince- her to the contrary?
America will never be secure in the respect of na
tions until the respect has been earned. ' When the
British flag flies above the deck of one of her Majesty's
vessels that deck is as much British territory as the
soil of Albion itself.. No matter in what clime, none
would presume to encroach. â¢ Note ' the difference.
An American ship is wrecked and takes hundreds
down to death. The circumstances tend to show the.
wreck to have been the result, if not of Spain's
treachery, at least of a feeling in consonance with her
sentiments. Yet Spain stretches out a bloody hand
and tells us we may not investigate save as she shall
direct and under her surveillance. Where does his
tory afford an example of insolence so monstrous? '
There is but one dignified course. It is for the
United States to inform Spain that while there is
weeping in hundreds of American homes for the
victims of an appalling catastrophe the inquest shall
not be conducted by the suspects. From this course
there can be no retreat without bringing this country
under the scorn of every, civilized people. To no
other people would even the impertinence of Spain
dare to formulate a demand which can only be con
sidered an affront the most gross.
The talk of settlement upon a monetary basis is
sickening. Either Spain is innocent in this particu
lar matter or she deserves to be swept from the seas,
stripped of her colonial possessions and driven back
to rot under the shadow of her decaying throne.
Honor is not to be bought for a price, and even to
consider the proffer of Spanish gold or worthless
Spanish promises would be not honor but deep and
lasting disgrace. The time is near for the haughty
Don to be humbled. He must learn to be respectful
and human, that murder is a crime, an insult offen
sive, and that people in this country do not take it
as a friendly act when the mutilated bodies of their
dead are reviled as they are being laid to rest on an
alien shore.
Sooner or later there will be a wiping out of the
old score. Americans are not interested in Cuba from
selfish motives alone. They remember the horrors
of the past, they recall the Lopez expedition and the
slaughters attending it, the Virginius and the wanton
murder of American boys bound and trampled under
the hoofs of cavalry while the populace made merry.
These things are not to be forgotten. That they
have seemed to be forgotten has lulled the Spanish
into a sense of power to override America. It is
fitting that when the cruel masters of Cuba surrender
their swords that on bended knee they hand them to
soldiers of the United States.
HANFORD ON THE CHINESE LAWS.
JUDGE HAXFORD of the United States Dis-
O J trict Court of Washington, who not long ago
decided that the wives and children of Chinese
holding certificates of admission to this country were
entitled to come in by virtue of their relationship,
now modifies his ruling by expressing the opinion
that the courts have no power whatever to determine
questions involving the right of any alien to enter the
United States. He declares that under the statutes
passed by Congress jurisdiction of the subject is
lodged in the administrative officers of the Federal
Government, and that no alien refused admission by
them is entitled to a writ of habeas corpus or any
other writ by which he can call the courts to his aid.
It is hardly possible to agree with this view of the
law. for so long as the principle upon which the writ
of habeas corpus reposes continues to exist â which is
likely to be until the end of time â any person de
prived of his liberty in the United States may have
an inquiry instituted into the cause of his restraint,
and. if no legal cause can be found, may be released.
It seems to us that if personal liberty is to be pre
served in this country it will be necessary to main
tain the writ of habeas corpus. But with Judge Han
ford's construction of the Chinese exclusion statutes
it is less difficult to deal, since his view is evidently
based upon a desire to promote the business interests
of the importers of Mongolian contract labor.
It is not and never was the intention of Congress
to confer upon the officials of the Treasury Depart
ment the absolute power of ruling on Chinese ad
mission certificates. The intervention of the courts
was counted on in all the legislation, and the best
evidence that such is the case is found in the fact that
the courts have always interfered to expound the law
when proper cases involving the statutes have been
brought before them.
Moreover, we can conceive of no greater misfor
tune to the country than the relegation of the au
thority to admit Chinese coolies entirely to the offi
cials of the Treasury Department. On several occa
sions the people of the Pacific Coast have found that
those officials are not to be trusted. A banquet at the
house of the Chinese Minister or a present of a
fragrant box of tea has on occasions completely
levolutionized the rulings of the department on Mon
golian questions. A change of administration has
also frequently produced an entire change in the
status of the restriction and exclusion laws.
It is to be hoped, therefore, that Judge Hanford's
view of the situation will not prevail. It may annoy
the Federal Judges to be compelled to pass upon
Chinese habeas corpus cases, but it is their duty to
do so. and the people expect them to constantly op
pose an insurmountable barrier to the admission of
all Chinese who are not legally certificated. This
work cannot be done by the executive arm of the
Government because it has no way of recording and
giving effect to its interpretations of the law. In
stead of seeking reasons for evading his responsibili
ties. Judge Hanford should stand up occasionally and
decide a case against the contract labor dealers.
Mrs. Lillian Peters rises in her wrath to pronounce
Pleasanton "jay." Of course the town is not grati
fied by the lady's verdict, and yet even greater au
thorities have put even greater towns on the jay list
without producing any permanently disastrous ef
fects; and perhaps Mrs. Peters will feel better now.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1898.
THE Mission Street Boodler thinks the limit on
taxation favored by The Call is altogether too
inflexible. "It is easy enough," says the
Boodler, "to criticize this provision (oÂ£ the proposed
charter) and to say that the Freeholders should tie
the limit at the other end also by limiting the basis
of taxation, but it is not so easy to establish a sys
tem that will restrain extravagance and stillÂ«provide
for the natural growth of the city."
We can readily understand the position of the
Boodler in this matter. That sheet makes very little
money holding up city officials or passing appropria
tion bills. A large part of its income is derived from
corporation "advertising" contracts. The Boodler
abuses a corporation until it "advertises." Then it
executes a contract by which it agrees in considera
tion of a stipulated sum per month to publish a
large quantity of silence every day about the corpora
tion and its affairs. This was the way it got $1000 a
month out of the Southern Pacific Company for
twenty-two months. Probabry it would still be "ad
vertising" for that corporation had it not grown ar
rogant and struck for a raise.
Naturally .the Boodler wants the town to grow.
The larger it becomes the more corporations there
will be to "advertise." We are, therefore, left in no
doubt as to its purpose in criticizing our idea of limit
ing taxation in this city. What the Boodler wants
is a large town with plenty of "advertising" corpora
tions in it. In such a town its profits could not fail to
be enormous. It can think of no better way to make
a large town than to keep taxes up and provide the
practical politicians who promote its business with
plenty of money.
Notwithstanding the disposition of the Boodler to
ridicule a limit on taxation which would force the
tax eaters to economize in salaries and ex
penses, however, we shall stick to our opinion
that the only way to prevent municipal
extravagance in San Francisco will be to
fix a maximum assessment roll and a maximum levy.
It will never do to rely on the moderation of the As
sessor. On one occasion the late Alexander Bad
lam, when Assessor, added $80,000,000 to the roll in
a single year. True, the assessments were afterward
declared invalid, but the incident illustrates what may
be done by an Assessor when there is a demand for
more money.
We have seen under practically the same rate of
taxation during a period of ten years the expenses of
the municipality increase from $4,000,000 to nearly
$6,000,000 without the construction of a single main
sewer, the improvement of a single accepted street or
the enlargement or reconstruction of a single public
building. The Boodler may want the city to continue
to "grow" in this way, but we are free to say we be
lieve most intelligent citizens are weary of such
progress.
CELEBRATING OUR GOLDEN WEDDING.
r "pHE sympathetic response made to The Call's
suggestion for a semi-centennial exposition in
* this city at once invests the project with the ele
ments of success. It is not against it that it will be
the year of the national campaign. Indeed, that is
one reason why it should be undertaken and will be a
factor in its success. The National Centennial in
Philadelphia was begun and ended in a Presidential
campaign. Both candidates appeared there. The
popular awakening which always accompanies a na
tional campaign aided the exposition.
The Columbian Exposition at Chicago was opened
in the midst of the campaign of 1892. If we are
ready with our semi-centennial we can easily secure
here the presence of both Presidential candidates, ac
companied by a great host of their followers and
countrymen.
It is well now to consider some of the striking fea
tures that can be made peculiar to such a celebration.
In our rainless summer we can do what cannot be
done elsewhere. lowa has exhibited her corn palace,
constructed entirely of that cereal, and her coal palace
at Ottumwa, built out of the coal of the Muchikinock
mines. Here we can build a palace of California olive
oil. We can have a chateau wholly of raisins and one
of prunes. In the hands of artists we can produce a
map of the State made out of the heads of wheat.
We can reproduce a winery entirely of wine, using the
different colors for the effects of light and shade, and
within we can have the vintage in actual operation
and can refresh the throngs with gourds full of the
fresh juice of the grape. We can build a quartz
mill entirely of gold-bearing quartz and operate its
stamps and show the actual clean up of amalgam and
retort it for the spectators to see. We can carry on
actual manufactures. We can set up a shipyard in
large miniature and build a model ship on its ways.
We can build a silk factory of our own cocoons and
in it can wind and weave the fiber. We can put in
a track and show our California horses in all their
forms. We can do more. Under cover we can build
a dairy palace of cheese and butter and in it make
them bqth by the latest processes. We can build a
mill of wool and in it card and spin the fleece and
weave it into fabrics. We can build a great aquarium,
divide it into salt and fresh water compartments, and
show our great variety of food fishes swimming in
their native element. In it we can exhibit the great
jew fish, the mighty tunny, sturgeon, sea bass, striped
bass, salmon and all the rest. In the center of this
palace of fishes, in an ample pool, we can gather a
company of sealions for exhibition at close range.
In fact there is hardly an end to the interesting fea
tures illustrating our materialities, made peculiar to
us and easily possible by our climatic conditions.
Such an exposition would be forever unique in the
world's industrial annals. Other places may build
high towers, produce mechanical effects and illustrate
the merely ornamental, but never elsewhere will there
be a rival to this which will so show all our materiali
ties as at the same time to permanently certify to all
the earth the clemency and individuality of our cli
mate.
Only the other day in New York the New York
Journal, through one of its ablest hired men, raised
an outcry against Bryan. Ever since then it has
been trying to explain that it did not mean it, and is
placing Bryan under the disadvantage of its ardent
support. As a matter of fact its effort to boom a
Mr. Van Wyck, understood to be part of the stage
property of Croker, fell so flat as to astonish even
its meager intelligence.
Perhaps the nerve of the Post in sticking to its
first hasty conclusions concerning the wrecking of
the Maine is to be admired. Certainly it is not every
paper that would so loftily refuse to be hampered
by facts.
None of the meek and lowly editors whose chief
desire seems to be to be kicked has yet suggested that
we extend an apology to Spain for permitting the
Maine to roil the waters of Havana Bay.
TAXATION LIMITS.
GORGIONI'S POLONAISE.
When Julius Germaine left the office
of the Shouter he was swearing aud
ibly. The virulence and variety of his
oaths seemed hardly to relieve his ex
asperation, however, for running
against the Police Court reporter at the
foot of the stairs, Germaine launched
forth anew into a turbulent sea of pro
fanity in which the city editor's name
tossed and tumbled by the angry waves
of his eloquence, ducked and staggered
and sailed on, only to be overtaken and
buffeted again and again.
"Oh, that'll all be taken for granted."
said the Police Court reporter, easily.
"Skip the introduction, and tell your
story. What's it all about?"
"Well,, he has sent me out to do a
classical concert."
"No!" exclaimed the reporter, his fat,
pimpled face glowing with malevolent
Joy.
"Oh, yes, he has," sneered Germaine.
"Matinee musicale â Signor Rizzoforte.
You know, clawhammers â women â
flowers â grand piano â lot of hypocrites,
who don't know what they're applaud
ingâpretend to like itâ don'tâ not aâ
all right, I won't. But, Rizzoforte, im
agine it! Lots of hair, oily, banging
beast â ugh!"
"It is tough," said Dobson, sympa
thetically.
"Tough! Tough!" shrieked Ger
maine. "Dobson, I tell you I know as
much about music as â as the office cat,
or the new press, or â or as a society
dude who sucks his cane and ogles the
women at the matinee musicale. Mat
inee musicale!" he snarled.
He was late. Boggs had forgot all
about the Rizzoforte concert till it was
half over; and Germalne's encounter
with Dobson had delayed him further.
He lounged into the foyer just in time
for the last number, thankful for this,
but irritated anew by the airs of the
ushers. His late entrance was a sac
rilege in the estimation of these claw
hammered votaries of the musical
deity, whose name the little mannikins
breathed in a sort of sacred ecstasy.
Germalne waited at the door, gnaw
ing his lip and smothering his dissat
isfaction, while his eye wandered from
the hushed, darkened, crowded hall to
the stage above.
There came a short pause, during
which the audience remained breath
less, reverential, and then burst into
frantic applause. Then the music be
gan again.
Leaning back, with his head and
shoulders against the heavy curtains,
Germaine discovered to his amazement
that all his fury, his intense disgust,
his irritation, had left him. His nerves
seemed to suck in the soft, lulling
sweetness of the melody that came now
from the piano, and his whole body was
bathed in reposeful ease. He closed bis
eyes and gave himself up to the feeling
of mental helplessness. He let himself
be soothed and salved and comforted.
He felt every ill slipping from him, and
his weary soul swam in a sensuous,
slow-moving sea, while his brain,
drugged with sweetness, slept.
When Germaine got back to the office,
it occurred to him that he had forgot
ten to note the player's personality.
This was a decided loss of material. He
had hoped to dilate upon this topic, in
default of real criticism. But he set
doggedly to work, holding on desper
ately to his programme â so much Greek
to him.
He dismissed each of the earlier
numbers, which, of course, he had not
heard, with a stereotyped mention, and
then, with a grateful sense of being
permitted finally to use his brain, he
launched into a panegyric of the closing
number. All that delicious feeling of
lotus-eating ease, that dolce far niente
of mind and body, came back to him as
he wrote; and, scorning longer to steer
by his memories of musical criticism,
as exhibited in the daily press, boldly
he struck into an enthusiastically eulo
gistic strain. As to the name of the
thing, he consulted the programme. Of
course, he had never before heard of
Gorglonl's "Polonaise," and he had a
vague idea that that should not have
been the name of that sweet, wondrous
melody that had bewitched him. But
he finished with a resounding, fervid
sentence, turned In his copy, and then
went home to bed.
Germaine noted with a pang the next
day that none of the morning papers,
except the Shouter, mentioned Gorgi
oni's "Polonaise." He re-read his own
account. It was not a criticism of the
concert; it was merely a hyperbolical
panegyric on Gorgloni's "Polonaise" as
played by Rizzoforte. It was just his
luck. He had made the Shouter ridicu
lous.
He was too sore, too blue, to stand
chaffing or lecturing. He was prepared
to fight Dobson or any and everyone
else who should mention things musical
to him, and he longed for an opportu
nity to beat the city editor to a pulp,
and then resign.
But Germaine, like many another
sore egotist, found that the world had
moved since yesterday. There was a
big murder story on, and the whole of
fice was in a thrill of excited anticipa
tion of a scoop. He was caught up in
the whirl of news-gathering, and be
came so interested in the great story
that he forgot all about Gorgioni's
"Polonaise" and his own fiasco.
The following day was a repetition of I
its predecessor. The men on the
Shouter breathed not nor ate nor slept;
they only worked. Germaine came
rushing into the city editor's room with
an Important bit of news bearing upon
the story. By this time there was but
one story to the Shouter'a reporters.
Hurriedly giving his notes to Dobson,
he turned to rush out again.
"Oh, Germaine â wait!" called Boggs.
"See here, you can't go out again on
this. I want you to do a concert."
Germaine stood speechless. Then,
looking up, words of remonstrance on
his lips, he caught Dobson's twinkling
eye, and like a maddened bull he
charged. But Dobson was marvelous
ly quick for so big a man. He es
caped, leaving Germaine to face the
music â his detail.
"I don't know any more about music
than I do about crocheting," said Ger
maine, between his set teeth, as he
reached for his hat. "There's Dobson.
Why don't you send him? His sister
plays the mandolin â or the guitar.
Blamed if I know which it is!"
"Oh, you're too modest," laughed
Boggs. "What is it you want â taffy?
All right. Rizzoforte's agent was in
this morning. You ought to have wit
nessed his Joy over your notice
Wednesday; he said there wasn't a
musical critic in town except you."
Germaine stared. "He's drunk," he
gasped.
"No doubt. Half a column or three
quarters, say. Let it run easy."
i Germaine crawl ad down stairs. He
was too disgusted to think; so desper
ate that evea to swear was no com
fort.
As he boarded a car he saw Dobson
sail by in a hack, and heard a shoutâ
"We're on his track"â as the horse
clattered on.
When he reached the concert hall
his face had settled into deep lines of
disgust and weariness. He was on
time, this time, and he sat drearily
through the programme, listening to a
sounding cataract of symphonies and
fugues and concertos, one so* like the
other to his ears that the "Shouter's"
musical critic ceased to consult his
programme, and lay back and longed
for death.
As the evening wore on, once more
Germaine took up the unintelligible
card that had been of so little use to
him. At the end he caught a name that
interested him. Gorgioni's Polonaise.
At least, he should hear, again that
beautiful melody.
Patiently he waited, now, and at last
the number was reached. Germaine
breathed a blissful sigh of anticipation.
But the heavenly strains he longed
for came not. Instead, a confused
cackle of sound came from the pianist's
fingers, an intricately classical, unintel
ligible jumble of notes, with odd ac
centuation, meaningless pauses, and, to
poor Germaine, utterly destitute of
plan or harmony.
"The beast!" Germaine muttered.
He could have thrashed the great
Rizzoforte for changing his pro
gramme. In deep disgust, as soon as
he could, he made his way to the door.
He turned here, maliciously pleased to
note that the pianist's last number had
not been well received. People were
evidently unfamiliar with this horrible
thing. They knew not the end had
come till Rizzoforte left the piano and
walked from the stage. Then they
burst into ashamed, belated applause.
Germaine grinned sardonically. But,
in response to the prolonged hand
clapping, the pianist returned.
In Germaine's perturbed mind a con
fusion of subdued oaths rumbled. But
as his ear caught the first strains from
the piano his face changed wonderfully.
He had made a mistake, of course; had
confused the second movement or some
such technicality of a piece with the
next number, or somethingâ it didn't
matter what. For now all was bliss
again, and Germaine leaned back and
listened and joyed in melody. Ah, if
he'd always play things like that one
might spend the night listening!
Germaine left the hall and started
downtown. Despite his shrinking dis
taste at writing up the concert, a sort
of laissez-aller had taken possession of
him. The lulling charm of that ex
quisite polonaise had once again taken
possession of him; its rolling sweetness
was a sort of buffer which stood be
tween his drugged nerves and anything
in the outer world which might have
irritated them.
He sat down and wrote, finding, to
his surprise, that it was easier this
time. As his pencil spun its way along
a sort of sardonic triumph lit up the
critic's face. It sounded like good stuff,
after all, though only heaven and Ger
maine could fathom that critic's ig
norance of his topic. As he read It
over he discovered that it was mainly
Gorgioni's polonaise over again, but
even this did not much perturb him.
When Germalne came into the office
early the next afternoon he was told
that Boggs wanted him.
In the city editor's office he was in
troduced to Algernon Johnson, the
great Rizzoforte's press agent. For a
moment an awful fear of detection
came over Germaine, but a glance at
Boggs' face â that Boggs, who never
yet had failed to stand by his men
brought confidence.
Mr. Algernon Johnson had called to
thank Mr. Germaine, personally. He
was amazed, yes, amazed to find in
this far western city a critic so appre
ciative, so superior, so discerning, so
delightfully aware of what was best
in music. Rlzzoforte himself, who
never read his papers, had remarked
upon the strangeness of the"Shouter's"
critic being so enthusiastic over Gor
gioni's polonaise, a composition which
is so far above the comprehension of
the mere dilettante that few audiences
can really enjoy it. Yet this marvelous
polonaise was so great a favorite with
the great Rizzoforte, and he, himself,
was so thorough an artist that â occa
sionally against his manager's advice
it must be admitted, here in confidence,
of course â he insisted upon its being
placed upon almost every programme,
that its repetition might finally edu
cate the ignorant masses up to appre
ciation of its beauties. Mr. Johnson, in
conclusion, had only to congratulate
the "Shouter" upon its good fortune
in possessing so eminent a critic, and
to assure Mr. Germaine of his profound
esteem and his entire willingness to be
of service to him at any time.
Boggs burst into a roar of laughter
as the door closed upon the agent.
"Your face, man," he explained to the
mystified Germaine.
"Well," the critic answered slowly,
"I am puzzled."
"What's this thing he talks so much
about? Did you really enjoy it? Who
gave you the tip to boom What's-his
name's polonaise? What's a polonaise,
anyway? I thought it was something
women wore. Say, old man. after this
you're booked, you know. No more ex
cuses. You'll just take charge of the
musicâ l'll make it all right with the
business office. You'll expect a good
salary, being so eminent, you know.
Oh. never mind your modesty. Just
keep track of concerts and things your
self. I'm glad to wash my hands of the
stuff. It's always been a nuisance."
Having had musical greatness thrust
upon him, there was nothing left for
Germaine but to live up to his role. By
degrees he became expert in writing
musical criticism. In time he grew ut
terly shameless in his pretense to criti
cal virtuosity and became an authority
whom none questioned. He never men
tioned Rizzoforte's name without ring
ing in a heartfelt bit about Gorgioni's
Polonaise, and when the great pianist
left town he sent the Shouter's critic
a Burne-Jones portrait of himself, in
the corner of which he had written the
first few bars of the beloved Polonaise,
above his signature.
A copy of this portrait was" printed in
the Shouter. The Pacific Lyre made
Germaine an offer to take charge of
its columns, and delegations from the
elite of the Western musical world
made pilgrimages to the Shouter's of
fice as to a shrine, where so holy a relic
was kept. Germaine's salary was
raised and raised again.
Years passed. Germaine's name and
position were established. He had
smothered the last murmur of his out
raged conscience beneath the Othello
pillow of gratified vanity.
There came a time when the local
Press Club was in difficulties. That
time came often. A concert had been
arranged and the various members of
ADVEBTISEMENTS. __

the club had done all that busy men
could do to make the affair a success.
Germaine lent to the occasion the dig
nity and grace of his presence; also his
portrait of Rizzoforte, before which
crowds stood gazing in reverential awe.
Germaine, too, lingered near the por
trait, not that he was in spirit one
of the worshipers at the musical shrine,
but that admirers might whisperingly
point him out as the famous critic who
possessed the portrait and the great
Rizzoforte's friendship. While he posed
here, ostentatiously unconscious, pres
ently from the next room came strains
of music. Germaine started. That
familiar, loved melodyâ it could be
nothing but Gorgioni's Polonaise. Sac
rilege! Desecration! Frowning por
tentuously, the great critic turned to
enter the next room, when the quite
audible words of a man near by stayed
him.
It was Bauvin. the violinist, whcfse
handsome dark head was close to the
blonde curls of a girl, a pupil of his,
whose childish face was lighted by love
and awe.
"Yes, Rizzoforte did play it," Bau
vin was saying. "You're right about
that. Nevertheless, it's cheap, a piece
of show-off, musical fireworks, in short.
It always catches the crowd, though.
Listen to the applause."
"Ah, Germaine. Miss Lovelsby, M.
Jules Germaine, the 'Shouter's' critic,
you know. We were speaking, Ger
maine, of that little barcarolle of
Heuer's. Of course you remember Riz
zoforte's playing it repeatedly as an en
core. I never could see, myself, why
fhe chose anything: so meretricious. I
understand that he had a great con
tempt for musical taste out here. How
it must have disgusted him to have to
play such stuff! But, of course, you
know more about his feelings than any
one else in town."
Germaine stammered something.
Bauvin's knowledge of music was be
yond suspicion. What could be the
meaning of this? He dared not ask,
but his bewildered musings were cut
short by Miss Lovelsby's voice.
"Tra-la-la-la-la-la," hummed the
clear soprano softly.
"No." corrected Bauvin, a trifle pe
dantically. "It's 'Tra-laâ la-laâ la
la' â you take it too slowly."
And stepping up to the portrait,
pointing to the notes written in tha
corner, Bauvin whistled softly and
slowly.
"That's it," Bauvin turned at length.
"That's about the tempo Rizzoforte ap
proved, isn't It, Germaine? Oh, how
the man did play! You must read Ger
maine on the way Rizzoforte played
Gorgioni's Polonaise, Miss Lovelsby. It
will give you an Insight into the spirit
of the composition that nothing else
can."
At another time, Germaine would
have listened to this praise with the
slightly bored, deprecating manner he
had learned to assume when his praises
were sung. Just now, however, he felt
bewildered, dizzy. His fame, his mod
est fortune had been built upon that
famous critique of Gorgioni's Polo
naise, when, in truth, he now discov
ered it wasn't a critique of the old mas
terpiece at all. In his desperate ignor
ance, on the night of Rizzoforte's first
concert, which inaugurated Germaine's
career as a musical critic, the unhappy
reporter' had â  heard only the encore
which the disdainful artist had thrown
as a sop to his audience. And all Ger
maine's eloquence, all his repeated,
hyperbolical paean of praise had been
offered up for Heuer's Barcarolle,
which ; Buavin had stigmatized as
"meretricious."- 1-
Germatne went home. He was too
miserable, too disheartened to endure
more. Of ; course, he had been aware
of his own ignorance, but he had yield
ed to the charm of being great for so
long that he had forgotten how little
he really was.

NOT TO DESTROY
The Purpose of the Office
of Insurance Com
missioner.
Attitude of the Present Of
ficial Antagonistic to the
Underwriters.
Much Dissatisfaction Is Shown Over
Mr. Clunie's Business
Methods.
The office of Insurance Commissioner
was created to protect the people by
restricting the privilege Cff issuing poli
cies in this State to companies finan
cially safo; and, that the Commis
sioner might be fully able to accom
plish this purpose, he was clothed with
very broad discretionary powers in in
quiring into and deciding upcm the
ability of a company to meet its obli
gations. To this end he can ask any
sort of questions which he assumes to
touch insurance, and he can compel
witnesses to testify before him, as pro
vided in Code of Civil Procedure for
civil cases: and refusal to answer any
Inquiry relating to the business at in
surance is punishable by a fine of $500.
The endowment of this broad power
presupposes the selection of a well-bal
anced officer, who will exercise it with
conservatism and discretion, for it is
authority which may be too easily
abused, to the annoyance of underwrit
ers, and with no benefit to either policy
holders or the State's revenues; and it
is possible for the Commissioner, unre
strained by the courts, to prohibit all
policy writing, under penalties as pre
scribed. If the companies could not be
harried into abandoning their expensive
plants and retiring from the State, an
incompetent or ill-disposed Commis
sioner can on some trumped-up pretext
resort to wholesale cancellation of li-
censes. It is therefore no idle assertion
that the most important business in
terests can be put in jeopardy in thi6
State by an Insurance Commissioner
unrestrained by reason or justice.
Our Commissioners have heretofore
been generally able and always con
servative in the exercise of this broad
power, but the present attitude of Com
missioner Clunle, in his indiscriminate
onslaught upon all underwriters, would
seem to indicate that Governor Budd
had used the very poor judgment of
turning a bull loose in our underwrit
ing china shop who, if not restrained,
may do infinite harm to the very inter
ests he was appointed to protect.
The Insurance Commissioner has
made certain demands on the nre un
derwriters, which they hold to be un
reasonable, impracticable and not in
accordance with the law. Such efforts
at compliance as have been made have
not met with the approval of the Com- i
missioner; and he has pr< -eded from
one demand to another, with steadfast
refusal to submit his views of the law
to the courts, in a test case, ending by
notifying practically all companies in
the State Â»o cease Issuing policies,
threatening dire penalties for any pol
icy issued by them.
From this arbitrary attempt to not
only ruin their business but to stop all
commercial transactions which require
insurance protection the companies
J ive appealed to the courts, and the
Restraining order issued by Judge Mor
row of the United States Circuit Court.
In the case of the insurance companies
against the Insurance Commissioner,
indicates that the controversy has
reached that point where facts and the
law will be substituted for loose state
ments, dogmatic pretensions and dis
quieting menaces.
The business men of San Francisco
and other cities, and property owners
generally throughout the State, are
deeply interested in this matter. Fire
insurance is at the bottom of credit
and solvency, and while its cost should
be restricted to a price only sufficient
to give full profit to the capital em
ployed, any arbitary rulings which
may compel the underwriters to tem
porarily suspend writing or force any
considerable number of companies to
withdraw in a body from the State,
could not have other than disastrous
effects. Business generally cannot be
transacted without the security of the
fire insurance contract, because busi
ness generally is done on credit, and by
compelling the fire underwriters to
cease writing for even a single day,
loans on houses and goods and sales of
improved realty would virtually cease.
Wholesale merchants would have to
withhold credit. Building operations
could not be continued. Policies ex
piring could not be renewed, new poli
cies could not be written; and the
burning of such uninsured risks would
entail a total loss to owners. Business
generally would be suspended as long
as underwriting was suspended.
The business men of the city have
just begun to take Insurance Commis
sioner Clunie seriously, and to realize
that there is a disturbance in the ma
chinery of the State which concerns
them "as well as the underwriters.
Judge Morrow's restraining order is
therefore welcome evidence of the reso
lution of the underwriters to continue
to guarantee indemnity for loss by fire,
in spite of the technical instructions
and wild threats of the Insurance Com
missioner. It is not doubted that the
courts will compel the Insurance Com
missioner to respect the undoubted le
gal rights of the underwriters, and io
construe the law the same as all his
predecessors have construed It.
The official totals of California pre
miums and losses are misleading. The
unfavorable figures of a number of re
tired companies are not included, and
the liability for (losses to be incurred
under) unexpired risks ranging from
one day to five years does not appear
in the loss totals, though the premiums
on such unexpired risks are included
in the premium totals.
It is a fact, not generally known, that
practically all the profits In the busi
ness of fire insurance, everywhere, are
drawn from the investment branch. The
average fire insurance dividend in the
rnited States, the most profitable field
In the world, is only 9 per cent; and
this percentage does not take into ac
count the vast amount of fire insur
capital destroyed by conflagra
tions or bad management. This 9
per cent average dividend is almost en
tirely the product of the investment or
hanking feature of the business; for
the average underwriting profit in this
country has been less than 4 per cent
of the premiums, which with other
income has been added to the reserves
to meet conflagration losses. Indeed,
if we add to the total of paid losses
the amount of fire insurance losses un
paid by bankrupt companies, the losses
f exceed the premiums; and this 4 per
o?nt alleged underwriting profit is
found to have no existence, except as
to the surviving companies. In the
Chicago fire alone $50,000,000 insurance
loesep wre never paid, that preat con
flagration having bankrupted several
hundred companies.

writers may combine as they may see
fit. but they cannot create any abso
lute or virtual monopoly. It is not
difficult for capitalists to engage in
fire insurance; the only restrictions are
those designed to insure solvency. Un
der such conditions, fire insurance can
never be a monopoly, nor can rates
ever be unreasonably high. In the ab
sence of any monopoly and of any spe
cial privilege granted fire insurance
companies, there can be no Just ground
for special taxes or restrictions as
to rates.
All other kinds of business differ from
underwriting in this one vitally import
ant particular: they know substantially
the cost of their goods, and can safely
and independently fix prices based <m
the known cost and expenses, while
fire underwriters can only guess at the
price of their goods. Fire underwriters
must combine and compare experiences
as to classes of risks, and fix rates ac
cordingly. Without a comparison of re- j
suits to use as a basis their rates are
only guesses, which subsequent individ
ual* and collective experience may show
to be sadly wrong and wholly inade
quate. Even the smaller few com
panies which are not members of
boards are obliged to depend on boards
for their rates. They dare not make
their own rates independently, for in
dividual experience is never a safe
guide.
Underwriters' boards and the fixing
of minimum rates according to the av
erage experience are absolutely indis
pensable to sound indemnity, for the
self-evident reason that the cost of the
goods (fire insurance for the time con
tracted for) is unknown. When there
were no underwriters' associations
there was no real indemnity, except at
much higher rates of premium than
those of to-day, in a mere handful of
ultra-conservative companies. Wildcat
companies abounded, and loss claims
were scaled outrageously or repudiated
outright.
Business men understand this matter,
and do not sympathize with the preju
dices of the ignorant nor defend the in
solent Commissioner's abuse of author
ity. Business men want sound indem
nity, and their own experience teaches
them that it cannot be supplied except
at adequate rates which will leave
some profit.
Meantime, pending the decision of
Judge Morrow, the business of fire un
derwriting is being conducted as usual
in San Francisco and throughout the
State by both American and foreign
companies. Policies are being written
without hindrance or fear, notwith
standing Mr. Clunie's foolish action re
garding nominal bonds for fees, signed
by millionaires. There can be no fear
as to the outcome of the present litiga
tion, nu-r as to the possible injuries
which our gallery-playing Commis
sioner may be disposed but is powerless
to inflict. The United States courts in
Kansas have ruled that a solvent com
pany able and ready to comply with
the laws cannot be prevented from do
ing so by an arbitrary act of a superin
tendent of an insurance department.
Here in California the companies are
solvent and have complied with the
laws, and must be allowed to supply
the public with indemnity, even though
the political ambition of Andrew Jack
son Clunie should thereby suffer a total
eclipse.
FREDERICK BELL ROASTED.
Attorney Fisher Ames Discusses j
Some of the Young Man's Fail
ings in Judge Coffey's Court.
Whether or not Theresa Bell will be re- j
moved as guardian of her children will be j
determined next Monday, when Attorney j
Schooler finishes his argument in behalf 1
of young Fred Bell, who instigated the
action against his mother. Yesterday
Fisher Ames, representing Mrs. Ames, ar
gued the case, and when he had finished
Frederick was the picture of despair.
Ames grilled the young man from the
opening to the close of his argument. He
referred to him as a "leech," a "house
hog." and repeated anew the story of how
Frederick some time ago indulged in a I
hilarious escapade with a company of
young people in which several ladies of j
color participated. Ames was merciless |
in his roast, but between his words of j
vituperation he worked In the legal end j
of his case, contending that under the law
in event Mrs. Bell was removed as guard
ian the court could not demand an ac
counting. He contended that she might
do as she pleased with the monthly fam
ily allowance. He averred that she had
always conducted the duties involved in
the matter of the guardianship of her
children in a satisfactory manner and
should not be interfered with. Schooler
will make his argument, and then the
fate of the children of the "House of Mys
tery" will be known to the world.

drawn from the very Inner circle of the

FOR KLONDIKE
AND KOTZEBUE
Steamers Rushing to One,
Sailing Vessels to
the Other.
Brave Act of Captain Niessen
of the Schooner Georgie
Woods.
Death oT a Prominent Central Ameri
can Merchant on the Steamer
Newpoit,
Gold hunters are beginning to turn
aside from the Klondike and Kotzebue
Sound and the Kowak are now becom
ing the mecca of the prospectors.
The barks Alaska and Northern Light
have now almost their full complement
of passengers, and other sailing ves
sels are being put on the route. The
sealing schooner Louisa D has been
purchased by a party of twelve from
lowa. They will fit her out for a two
years' stay in Kotzebue Sound. They
will anchor in a safe place and will
make "excursions up the KoVak River
in their own boats in search of gold.
The fine barkentine Catherine Sudden
has been chartered by parties here and
she will also go to Kotzebue in com
mand of Captain Fred Green, the well
known Arctic whaler. The barkentine
is to be built up from the fore right aft
to the mizzen mast, and will have first
class accommodations for over one hun
dred and fifty passengers.
A river steamer and lumber for a
large house are to be taken along, and
the vessel is to remain sixty days in
the sound in order to bring back the
gold hunters who may have got tired
or disgusted with the venture. All who
wish to return will be brought back
free of charge, but will have to furnish
their own provisions on the way down.
As the demand for passages to Kotze
bue Sound is daily growing more nu
merous the chances are that several
other sailing vessels will be added to
thÂ£ lleet bound for Kotzebue before the .
ice breaks up next spring.
The steamer City of Columbia, on her
way here from New York with a party
of gold hunters, touched a hidden rock
while entering the harbor of Valparaiso
the other day. She is not thought to
be seriously damaged, but nevertheless
Captain Baker will put her on the dry
dock for repairs. The passengers on
the City of Columbia are making a
holiday trip of it, having stopped at all
the points of interest so far between
New York and Valparaiso. The vessel
is now out sixty-three days, and it will
probably be some time in April before
she gets to San Francisco.
Three vessels bound for Dyea and
Skaguay are to leave in succession.
The Cottage City will get away to-day,
the Umatilla will sail to-morrow morn
ing, and the Australia is scheduled to
sail Monday afternoon. The Cottage
City will take away Charles and John
Raub and Chris Madsen, all three of
whom have given up their jobs as grip
men on the Powell street road to go
to the Klondike to look for gold. J.
Madsen and F. Summerstein of the !
Mount Eden Salt Works will also be
of the party. They will all go to the j
Yukon by way of Stickeen River. This
makes the fourth party of gripmen that
have left the Powell street road and
one-half of the cars of that line are now
run by new men.
Captain H. Niessen of the schooner
Georgie Woods did a very brave deed
a couple of days ago. The vessel was
on her way from the California Powder ,
Works, when the boom swung over and !
knocked Chris Nelson, the deckhand, j
overboard. Captain Niessen at once i
threw the vessel up in the wind and
dropping the anchor Jumped over after
Nelson, who could not swim. After a
hard struggle he got the man back
aboard, and then they both got up the
anchor and made sail as though noth
ing had happened.
The Harbor Commissioners notified
George Smith & Sons yesterday that if
they have not twenty additional paint
ers at work on the ,new ferry depot
within the next three days the contract
will be taken away from them and the
job finished at the expense of their

The Pacific Mall Steamship Com
pany's Newport arrived from Panama
and way ports yesterday with thirty
one cabin and twenty-seven steerage

i thirty-six packages of treasure valued

OLD WOMAN
BADLY BURNED
Mrs. Annette Schwob Sets
Fire to Her Own
Clothing.
She Locked Herself in Her
Room to Accomplish Her
Purpose.
It Waa Her Second Attempt at
Destruction in Three
Weeks.
Mrs. Annette Schwob, an old French
woman living at 2971 Twenty-first
street, was puinfully burned about her
body yesterday afternoon, and her
death is momentarily expected. She is
75 years of age, and a short time ago
j was declared by the court jto be mental
{ly incompetent. H. U. Jordon was ap
l pointed her guardian. She is possessed
of quite an estate.
Mrs. Schwob lives with her grand
daughter, Mrs. A. Karl, who takes care
of her. She has a rear room on the first
floor, in which there is a false fire
place, and only a short time ago she
attempted to build a fire in it, but was
detected by some of the family before
she could accomplish her purpose.
Yesterday afternoon she went into her
room and locked the door. This was
about 5 o'clock, and shortly afterward
j one of Mrs. Karl's children discovered
i smoke in. the front hall, and called to
i her mother, who was upstairs. Mrs.
i Karl came down and tried to get into
! the room, but could not. She then ran
across the street to where some carpen
ters were at work and called for help.
! The men came and broke In the door.
Mrs. Schwob was found lying upon
the floor, and the wrapper that she
wore was afire, as well as the frame
woodwork of the door. When the flames
were extinguished it was found that
1 the old woman was horribly burned on
1 her left side, and her left arm was re
duced almost to a crisp.
Dr. Charles F. Griffin was summoned
and did all in his power to relieve Mrs.
Schwob's 'sufferings. She was given in
jections of morphine to quiet her. The
family wanted to have her removed to
the French Hospital, but this was
deemed inadvisable by Dr. Griffin, who
thought his patient's condition too se
rious to stand it. A trained nurse was
secured to attend her. There is little
hope entertained for her recovery un
account of her extreme age and the
very serious nature of her injuries.
PHYSICIANS ON THE STAND.
Two Witnesses Testify as to the In-
nocence of Theodore Figel.
Two witnesses were introduced for the
defense in the Figel case yesterday. Drs.
Hill and Bunnell gave their testimony,
but nothing new was elicited by the
stories given. When the physicians were
called it was supposed that many new
point 3 would be brought forth in accord
with the promises of the defense, but
owing to the short timo given to witnesses
during the day the listening public was
disappointed.
After the witnesses had been called and
testified as to the wounds received by the
deceased, Isaac Hoftni-in, the court ad
journed until Monda. morning at 10
o'clock. The recess was tak^-n at the sug
gestion of Judge Murphy, who had other
important business to attend to. On Mon
day morning the defense promises many
rathor startling points and strong testi
mony to show that the defendant, Theo
dore A. Figel, has been imposed upon by
being charged with the murder of Isaac
Hoffman on the evening of June 1.
A GIN STOEY.
Leon Poon Could Not Pay for His Bar
Fixtures and Was Charged
With Embezzlement.
Leon Poon, a leading denizen of Ross
alley, was subjected yesterday to the in
dignity of being placed under arrest on a
charge of embezzlement. The complain
ant was Martin Sherwood, a furniture
dealer, whose place of business Is on
Stockton street, between Pacific and
Uroadway. He alleges that Poon has em
bezzled J3O from him.
Poon's story, as told at the California
street police station, is to the effect that
he bought some bar furniture from Sher
wood for his saloon at IS Ross alley,
where he dispensed sam shun, creosote
and "rectified" whisky, brandy and gin
at 5 cents per glass to Chinatown bums
and other lovers of strong spirits. But
the bums and their nickels being few and
far apart. Poon's business did not pay,
and he could not liquidate the $30 balance
he owed Sherwood. He offered Sherwood
the goods back, he said, if Sherwood did
1 not care to wait for the money.
Sherwood did not care to do either, and
had Poon arrested.
FOBESTERS AT OUTS.
J. G. Chase on Trial for Threaten
ing to Kill E. P. Donovan.
Judge Joachimson's court room was
crowded, yesterday morning with mem
bers of the Village Belle Circle, Com
panions of the Forest, to listen to the
examination of J. G. Chase, the financial
secretary, charged with threatening to
kill Edward P. Donovan, the chief com
panion, last Friday night, at a meeting
of the circle in the Alcazar building.
Several witnesses for the prosecution
testified that the threats made by the
defendant to *.ake Donovan's life "were
entirely unwarranted. Although Chase
had put his hand in his hip pocket no
weapon was found upon him.
The case was continued until next
Thursday, when Chase will make his de
fense. He expects to prove that he did
not use any vile language at the time
nor did he make any unlawful disturb
ance. As his accounts with the circle
are perfectly correct, he will contend that
Donovan had no right to question them
in open meeting.
UNION TRUST COMPANY SUED.
LÂ»rawn Into Court as the Guarantor
of the Nob Hill Development
Company.
Amanda L. Wilson has commenced suit
against the Union Trust Company for
$13,300, alleged to be due on bonds Issued
by the Nob Hill Development Company,
on which the signature of the defendant
appeared as surety. When the bonds of
the Nob Hill Development Company, of
which Joseph Rosenthal is the president
and S. Joseph Thlesln secretary, issued
bonds to raise money to carry out cer
tain projects, the Union Trust Company
certified the bonds. Property at Jones
and California streets was owned by the
defendant, and the plaintiff alleges that
a mortgage of $25,000 was on It of which
she had no knowledge. Notwithstanding
the fact that she was l&norant of the
standing of the defendant corporation,
she purchased the bonds on the strength
of the Indorsement of the Union Trust
Company. Since that time she has been
unable to regain the money she Invested.
$13,500, from the Nob Hill Company, and
now Bues the guarantor for the amount
she alleges Is due her.
An Ungrateful Scamp.
Captain Joel Spohn, of the Volunteers of
America, swore to a complaint in Judge
Low's court yesterday for the arresl of
J. O. Howard on the charge of grand
larceny. Howard visited the headq tar-
J.era of the Volunteers on Monday jilsrtu
and tusked for shelter as he was hard
up. He said he wag the son. of wealthy
parents in Philadelphia, and as he ex
pected a remittance every day, he would
repay any kindness shown him. He was
kept in the place until Thursday night,
when he departed, after stealing $65 from
Spohn.
UTILLIAM AUSTIN GETS LIFE.
Sentence Passed on James Fannon's
Murderer by Judge Wallace.
William Austin, recently convicted of
the murder of James Fannon, the jury
fixing his punishment at imprisonment for
life, was sentenced to Folsom Prison by
Judge Wallace yesterday morning. The
convict's counsel made no motion for a
new trial, probably at Austin's sugges
tion, as he considers himself lucky that
he escaped the noose, and is not anxious
to again run the risk, but asked that
his client bk sent to Folsom. The court
followed the application, and the murder
er will spend the remainder of his days
within the walls of that penitentiary.
Austin Is a cold-blooded criminal, and
laughed when the court pronounced sen
tence upon him. He was pleased that he
was not sent to San Quentin, as he had
heard that a brother of the man he mur
dered is incarcerated in that prison, and
he had no desire of making a companion
of him.
A. Arlington, said to be a natural born
swindler, who suffered a conviction on a
charge of uttering a forged order for a
small amount of money, was sentenced
to ten years at Folsom. Arlington had
two prior convictions against his name,
and the only thing that saved him from
a more severe sentence was the fact that
the Jury recommended mercy on the part
of the court when it came to pass a sen-
tence.
Robert 'Wise, convicted of assaulting
John McGrath with a tin bucket, was
sentenced to serve the next three months
of his existence within the walls of the
County Jail.

ally as to his alleged profligate con- '
duct, and during the discussion it is
alleged that the father rushed at the ;
son with outstretched fingers and tried
to tear his eyes out. The son, who is a
strapping young fellow, knocked his
father down and the family conference
was brought to an abrupt termination.
Mrs. Smith kept her son in a dark- ;

Eva: Every afternoon about 5 o'clock I begin to gape and
yawn and I yawn and gape and yawn till bed-time. If
I nip one yawn in the bud the next follows almost im-
mediately and is bound to be a regular jaw-breaker.
May: I had such an experience myself one time, and Ire-
member asking the doctor whether one should try
to keep from yawning, and he said no, that the act of
gaping gives to the blood more oxygen and acts by
mechanical pressure on the heart and lungs. If one
has chronic gaping it is a symptom which should cause
the affected one to look after her general health, for
it is a sure sign that something is wrong.
MRS. Moore : It is pretty well understood that yawning is an
ailment that comes from indigestion or lack of tone in
the system and may be cured by taking a Ripans
Tabule before retiring. After a few days of this treat-
ment the tendÂ«iÂ£y will disappear.

IT WOULD BENEFIT ALL THE COAST
Representative Citizens Strongly Favor the Holding of a Semi-Centennial Exposition to Commemorate the
Admission of California Into the Union.
With Concerted Action No Trouble Should Be Experienced in Securing the Hearty Co-operation of Adjoining Statesâ The Legislature Will, in All
Probability, Make an Appropriation to Assist in Carrying Out the Project.
THE Midwinter Fair proved a suc
cess both financially and as an
advertisement of the many re
sources of California. The exposition
suggested by The Call will prove of far
greater benefit not alone to this State
but to the entire Pacific Slope. .
All that is now required to make the
Bemi-centennial exposition of 1900 one
that will attract the attention of the
entire civilized world is concentration
of action. The idea erf holding a gigan
tic exposition to commemorate the fif
tieth anniversary of th<- admission of
California into the sisterhood of States
meets with general approval. That we
should have an exposition that will re
dound to the credit of the coast is ad
mitted by every one. We have within
our reach everything that would tend
to make the exposition one which would
bring to our hospitable shores many
of the visitors who will cross the ocean
to attend the Paris exposition. The
half-century of California Statehood
IT IS A VERY LARGE UNDERTAKING.
The proposition is ail right. It is an excellent
idea, and I give The Call great credit. for its evolution.
It is a very large idea, and its possibilities for good
are simply incalculable. If elaborated and carried
out on a scale commensurate with the importance of
the undertaking the benefits which would accrue to
the city and State would be beyond all computation
â for the reason, partially, that we should feel the
direct benefits for years after the close of the expo
sition
In a residence of twelve years in this city I have
seen some very material changes on the part of the
body politic. I will cite one. The people of San
Francisco have begun to appreciate the value of ad
vertising. As an illustration of this I have heard no
end of favorable comment from all parts of the State
regarding the benefit certa'n to result from the superb
Jubilee edition of The Call, recently published in the
interests of the whole State. The advertising value
of that publication is, of course, beyond all computa
tion. So would be the advertising value of the stu
pendous undertaking which is now proposed in this
exposition. It could not be estimated in dollars â nor
in millions of dollars.
I am heartily in favor of any plan which prom
ises to brirg California to the notice of the East.
They have too many people in that section and we
have not nearly enough here. Let us show them
that we have the best possible sort of an opening for
people of the right kind for whom there is no rpom
in "oJder" localities.
Here is a pointer. Italy and California have ap
proximately the same area. Italy has 30,000,000 peo
ple; California contains, roughly stated, i,ijoo,ooo
souls. No one who is informed in the matter will
deny that this State is naturally capable of supporting
as many people as Italy. There is need for this pro
posed exposition or for any other agency which shall
call to the notice of the world our amazing resources
and our possibilities in the way of supporting a dense
population.
I hope that this thing may be pushed vigorously
and that the excellent plan may be carried through
to a brilliant conclusion. H. D. LOVELAND,
Secretary Wellman, Peck & Co.

CI^OVKRDALE, Feb. 18.â This was
children's day at the Citrus Fair. The
public schools adjourned at noon and
500 Native Sons and Daughters received
lessons In one of the leading indus-
tries of California â the citrus industry.
All the attendants were continually
kept busy answering leading and in
telligent questions propounded by the
youngsters, whose search for knowl
has been full of development and
progress.
An exposition illustrating the mis
sion period and the subsequent epochs
of <>ur history could not fail but excite
the greatest interest. It would not
alone be a local affair. The ten States
admitted after California would un
doubtedly take part in the celebration
and materially assist in making the
exposition one worthy of the occasion.
The people of Nebraska have shown
what can be accomplished by united
action. The Trans-Mississippi Congress
to be held at Omaha during the sum
mer promises to be a grand success. All
of the trans-Mississippi States have
taken great interest in the project and
will be represented there. No difficulty
should be experienced in bringingabout
a joint exposition of the junior States
in 1900.
The Native Sons intend holding a
celebration in 1900, and many of thepi
have expressed a willingness to aid in
advancing the semi-centennial exposi
tion. The Young Men's Institute and
other kindred fraternal organizations
also favor the plan of a grand celebra
edge win In future years redound in the
benefit and improvement of California.
The pavilion was well filled to-day
with Cloverdale people and strangers.
The first day's sales of tickei3 exceed
doubly the expectations of the mana
gers. Credit is given to Ths Call on
all sides for its superior mencion of thÂ°
fair.
Among the leading exhibits which
have not been heretofore reported are
the displays of G. B. Baer of the grape
fruit or pomolo, an almost tropical
fruit used mostly for medicinal pur
poses. Menihan's display of navel
oranges from a one-acre grove a half
block from the center of town, is in
deed wonderful. It includes some large
Joppa oranges two years old, picked
this week and well preserved. Two
large-sized palm trees at the entrance
of the pavilion give an artistic effect.
About fifty canaries owned by Mrs. P.
Anker are distributed in the pavilion,
and add to the musical features of the
fair. Mrs. Alice Bryant and Miss Annie
I-aughlin of Mark West, display a
large case of handsome needle work.
G. W. Hoyle included a few remarks
in his welcome speech which are
worthy of careful consideration. Said
he.
Did you ever think what a fine legacy
it would be for your children, when you
are callod to leave them, If you could
have one aero of citrus fruits. For in
stance, take one acre of lemons. That
means about one hundred trees. Put the
cust of one acre of land at $50, the
cost of trees at $50 and $900 to care for
them for six years, which I think is a
liberal allowance. That means a total
allowance of $1000 for one acre of lemons
in bearing. At the end of six years, as
demonstrated by the orchards of Meni
han, Haney, Crocker and others, you can
pick one dozen lemons, or an average of
that number, from each tree each week
throughout the year, the lemon being a
perpetual bearer. That means 100 dozen
of lemons a week from one acre. Count
those lemons at 20 cents a dozen, which Is
a low estimate, and the yield would equal
$20 a week from the orchard, and for a
year it would be $1040. Now, you will

tion and will assist in carrying out the
project.
There is no doubt but that the next
Legislature would make an appropria
tion if the matter was properly brought
to its attention. No time should be lost
in getting ready for the exposition. A
meeting called by either the Governor
or Mayor for the purpose of discussing
plans would be attended by represent
ative men from all walks and stations
in life. There is no reason why the ex
positon should not be a grand success,
for the benefits derived will be shared
by the entire Pacific Coast.
DESIRABLE
AND FEASIBLE.
Hard Work Will Be Required to
Effect Ocod Results, Says
Irving M. Scott.
"The plan is both desirable and feas
ible," said Irving' M. Scott when asked
yesterday as to his opinion in this mat
ter. "No intelligent man would at
tempt to deny the benefits which might
reasonably be expected as the result of
such an enterprise, properly managed
as to its working details. But it will
call for an immense amount of hard
work to insure results of sufficient ben
efit to the city aid State to warrant
the enormous expenditure of time,
money and labor which would neces
sarily be called for in an undertaking
c-f such great magnitude. When we
take into consideration the Paris fair
in the same year and the Pan-Ameri
can lair to be held in Buffalo, N. V.,
next year, we see that we shall have
features of no small force to 'work
against.' and there will probably de
velop other obstacles not now discern
ible, but at the same time I consider
this project entirely feasible with the
energy and efficient management which
so important a work is certain to elicit
from the loyal workers of California
when her vital interests are at stake.
We have a community small in popula
tion, compared with populations from
which successful fairs elsewhere have
drawn their support, and there are cer
tain disadvantages under which we
must inevitably suffer in 'the way of
physical conditions, but there are no
insurmountable obstacles in our path,
and so I say that the plan is not only
advisable but also feasible. I can see
in this project the possibilities of stu
pendous advantage to California, and
hc-pe that the plan may be fully ex
ploited and adopted in earnest if it
shall be found advisable to go ahead in
the business."
SHOULD BE
A SUCCESS.
The Possibilities of Benefit
Clearly Beyond All
Estimate.
F. W. Van Sicklen of Dodge, Swee
ney & Co., represented his firm in ap
proving of the proposition in hand. "If
taken hold of with a will," he declared,
"there is no reason why the thing
should not be made a grand success.
There should be, of course, neither pol
itics nor personal interests in it, but
whole-souled, hard work for the good
of the city and State, that would insure
a healthy benefit for the community at
large â and that is what is needed. The
possibilities of benefit in the matter
are, of course, beyond all estimate; the
actual outcome of advantage will de
pend very largely upon the details of
i management, and there is little doubt
I that if the plan should proceed toward
! fulfillment these features would be
j wisely and properly settled. If it should
i be found advisable to go ahead in this
business I have no doubt that the bus
! mess men of the city and State will
j stand ready to support the enterprise
; in every possible manner."
AN EXCELLENT
PROPOSITION.
If Undertaken, Business Men in
General Will Support it
Liberally.
George T. Hawley, vice-president of
the Hawley Brothers Hardware Com
pany, gave cheerful commendation to
notice that it would require $13,000 placed
on interest at 8 per cent to yield the same
annual income, while in reality you have
only $1000 invested. Just consider this
matter, as It will bear investigation.

Time For Decisive Action.
CHATTANOOGA, Term., Feb. 18.â
Judge D. M. Key of this city, PoÃt-
master-General in President Hayes'
Cabinet, and ex-United States Judge,
expresses himself strongly on the dis
aster to the Maine. He is quoted lit
erally as follows: "If this catastrophe
can be traced to any Spanish officials
or any subjects owing 1 allegiance to
Spain, I think the United States should
demand an indemnity, and any neces
sary measures to collect it without de
lay should be taken. No dilatory tac
tics should be employed with Spain in
a matter of this kind. No amount of
money can pay for the lives lost, but
the American people will demand some
heavy compensation for the disaster
and will not rest until they get it. The
time has come for decisive action."
the plan which has for Its object the
promotion of the best interests of this
city and State, and expressed the hope
that the good work might be pushed
forward vigorously. He said: "It is
a proposition which should elicit the
co-operation of all of San Francisco's
and California's friends, for it is clearly
in the interests of this city and State.
An affair of the kind contemplated, if
as well managed as we ought to be
able to manage it, could not fail to be
of very great permanent advantage to
every California industry. If it shall
be found feasible to undertake this pro
posed exposition, I am sure that it will
be very liberally supported by business
men generally, for it is an excellent
business proposition on its face. I
hope to see the present agitation of this
matter result in some definite action
very soon."
ADVERTISE
OUR RESOURCES.
They Are Not Brought to Pub
lic Attention Often
Enough.
JOSEPH LEGGETT, attorneyâ Here
in the West we are to a certain extent
cut off from the rest of the world and
are forced by our environments to
adopt methods unnecessary in the
Eastern States to attract public atten
tion. California's wonderful resources
have attracted widespread attention
wherever they have been shown, but
they are not brought to the attention
of the public half often enough. Let
us have an exposition State, national,
aye, international, if possible, with
California as the central figure, and its
results will be almost incalculable. We
must have something attractive, some
thing that will be thought about and
talked about outside the State, and
thousands will come; many of them to
invest their money and stay. The labor
and expense of getting up a successful
exhibit is hardly a circumstance when
we begin to figure on the results which
will accrue from it. Let our public
men take hold and pu?h things with a
vim and vigor that will insure success
from the outset, and the world will be
with us. Don't hesitate or falter. Get
down to active work at once and no
mark is too high to aim at â it will be
reached.
NOT WELL KNOWN
IN THE EAST.
A Grand Opportunity to Exhibit
the Resources of the Golden
State.
EX-MAYOR h. R. ELLERTâ A
great exposition, such as the contem
plated one in 1900, can have but one
result â the attraction of great num
bers of people to the far West and the
impressing upon their minds of its
great advantages. It is surprising to
find how little people in the East know
of conditions and advantages in the
West. From time to time exhibitions
of various kinds have been success
fully carried out here, and while all
have been of some value, none have
been broad enough in their scope to be
of any lasting value. We want some
thing out of the ordinary, something
grand in its conception and lasting in
its benefits, and we will have occasion
for congratulation. It has always been
demonstrated that nothing is too vast
for California to attempt, so let us all
get together at once and show the
world something. We can do it if we
only half try. and our children and
children's children will reap the re
sults.
IS A GRAND
SUGGESTION
Every County in the State
Should Contribute Toward
the Exposition.
CAPTAIN D. A. SMITH, adjutant of
the Fifth Regiment Infantry, N. G. Câ
Of course the proposed exhibition
is a grand projoct, but to carry it out
it ought to be started by popular sub
scription. I do not believe In soliciting

Canadian Pacific Road
Makes Some Whole-
sale Reductions.
Passengers Carried From New
England to North Pacific
Points for $80.
The Grand Trunk Invites All Chicago
Lines to Fight the Foreign
Competitor.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Feb. 18.â The Canadian
Pacific road to-day exploded a bomb
among its American competitors by an
nouncing a wholesale reduction of
rates. These cuts affect business In
two directions. In the first place the
rates from all New England points to
Minneapolis and St. Paul are slaught
ered, and again Ne\v England points
and points in the State of New York
have had a blanket rate applied so far
as all business, to North Pacific Coast
points is concerned. These trans
continental rates have been cut almost
in two. The present rates from the
Atlantic seaboard to me North Pa
should contribute to, as every one will
be interested in the celebration of the
State's semi-centennial anniversary.
Possibly each county might raise a
fund by a small tax on property, and
if the money so raised should happen
to be more than needed, why the sur
plus could be returned to the general
fund of the contributing county. If
such a fair is to be started, let it be
a popular movement, and let every
county without exception make an in- t
teresting exhibit if its resources.
AN EXPOSITION
IS NOW NEEDED.
The Resources of the Pacific
Slope .Should Be Exhibited
to the World.
P. N. LILIENTHAL, manager Anglo-
Californian Bank â An exposition in 1900
is just what we need, and let a few pub
lic-spirited men take hold of it and we
will have one that will long be remem
bered. The Midwinter Fair gave people
a slight idea of what California can do
in this way, and we want to continue
the good work begun at that time. It
had no financial assistance either from
the State, county or national Govern
ment, and yet it not only paid its own
expenses, but there was money left
over. About the time of the pro-posed
exposition many successful gold hunt
ers will be returning from the Klon
dike, and the exposition will just fit in
where it is wanted. The people of the
West are especially noted for their en
terprise in matters of this kind. The
vim with which they take hold of them
has before now attracted the attention
of the world. Let us have a grand ex
position of the products of the Western
States, with California as the central
figure; one that will eclipse the Mid
winter Fair, and its results will be in
calculable. The Call is to be com
mended for its public-minded spirit in
forwarding this enterprise.
THE PEOPLE
ALL APPROVE
Popular Expressions Show That
the Proposition Is Generally
Favored.
The following interviews with people
of prominence show that the idea of
having an exposition to commemorate
the fiftieth anniversary of the admis
sion of California into the sisterhood of
States meets with general approval. It
is admitted by every one that an expo
sition such as is contemplated would
prove of great benefit, not alone to
California, but to the entire Pecific
Slope.
GEORGE T. SHAW, grand secretary
of the Independent Order of Odd Fel
i lows â I indorse the idea of a grand fair
in 1900. We cannot have too many such
fairs, providing they are properly man
- aged and are made attractive. Such a
fair should be in the hands of persons
thoroughly competent to present to the
, visitors all the resources of our State.
FRANK S. POLAND, deputy grand
master workman of the Ancient Order
of United Workmen â There can be no
doubt about the amount of good such
an exposition will do to the State. It
will advertise it, and we cannot ad
vertise our State too much. If such an
exposition is got up it will be the means
of having the State talked about for a
long time. I'm in favor of advertising
our State all the time.
JOHN J. CORDY, grand secretary of
the Foresters of America â What do I
think of the proposition of a California
exposition in 1900? Why, I think it is
grand. It ought to be supported and
advocated by everybody. Such an af
fair would be of immense benefit to the
State in the thousands of people it
would bring here and the amount of
advertising it would give to our re
sources.
MRS. S. ISABELLA HUBBARD, re
gent of Sequoia Chapter, Daughters of
the American Revolution â The propo
sition of a grand exposition on the
semi-centennial anniversary of the ad
mission of California as one of the
States of our glorious Union is one that
deserves the hearty support of every
patriotic man and woman who believes
in the advancement of our State.
MRS. EMMA HARRINGTON, grand
chief companion of the Companions of
the Forest of Americaâ l am in favor
cific Coast are $79 35 first class, and
$67 40 second class.
To-morrow the Canadian Pacific will
make these rates from all points in
New England and New York $40 first
class and $30 second class. Rates to
St. Paul will be cut from $29 50 first
class and $28 50 second class to $20 first
class and $19 Becond class.
On learning the Canadian Pacific's
intention In the matter the Grand
Trunk road at once invited the Chicago
roads to join It in meeting these rates
via Chicago. They have been Impor
tuning the Grand Trunk for months to
join them in meeting the Canadian Pa
cific rates, little thinking that as soon
as such an agreement was affected the
Canadian Pacific slash work alone
would cause such havoc with their rev
enues. If they agree to the Grand
Trunk's request it will mean the im
mediate reduction of the rates from
Chicago to North Pacific points from
$61 50 first class and $51 50 second class
to $40 first class and $30 second class.
Doubtless the Northern Pacific and the
Great Northern roads- will be as anx
ious as the Grand Trunk that the
Chicago roads should join In meeting
the rates. Their refusal would simply
mean that they had gone out of the
business for the time being, and tha,t
would mean that the two roads named
running west from St. Paul would get
little or none of the business, because
they would have no Eastern connec
tions to take it to them, and the Ca
nadian Pacific is not likely to give
them any. â¢
A meeting of Interested lines has
been called for to-morrow to decide
on some definite course of action, but
it may have to be adjourned to the be
ginning of the week on account of the
absence of many of the general pas
senger agents in the East. At a meet
ing held here to-day It was decided to
ask trunk lines to assist In fighting the
Canadian Pacific.

LIEUTENANT-COLONEL VICTOR
D. DUBOCE of the First Infantry, Na

question but that the idea of a semi

would do much to advance the State
and to bring it prominently before the
world. In the furtherance of such a
proposition there should be unanimous
action of the press of the State, no
matter what newspaper opinions may
be on other matters. With the unani
mous aid of the press of the State such
an exposition can be made a great suc
cess.

outlined in The Call is one that would
be of great benefit to the State if
handled in the proper spirit.
W. J. McARTHUR, editor Coast Sea
man's Journal â Speaking from the
FAVORS A PERMANENT EXHIBIT.
I am always in favor of any public demonstra
tion which will bring Califcrnia to the fore and edu
cate the people. You can write pages and fill
volumes, but the people will never read what has
been written. What you need is something to at
tract them to a given point and then have some
thing there that will be impressed on their minds
for all time â something that they can and must see
and see plainly, and when this is done something
has been accomplished. I would favor a complete
and comprehensive exhibit of all that California
produces and as much other material as can be con
veniently procured, the exhibit to last as long as
there is sufficient interest manifested in it to war
rant its being kept open. Ido not look at the finan
cial end. of the thing at all ; that will take care of
itself. Let us spend as much money as is necessary,
and if it proves a financial failure and an educational
success it is a grand success. We may feel truly
grateful â the end has been accomplished, the goal
reached. But we must not let matters end with the
erection of a few flimsy buildings, to be torn down a
few months after their erection â we want some
thing permanent. Of course we must realize that
much good material will be collected which can only
be borrowed for a short time, but there will also be a
great deal which can be kept as lons as necessary
and renewed from time to time. What we want
then is a permanent building of good dimensions, say
70x300 feet, where there will be a permanent
exhibit of the best the State produces with some
novelties thrown in to attract. Then we will have a
place where visiting strangers can go at any time
and be both instructed and entertained. The cost of
keeping such a building will be slight and the results
almost incalculable. California has always been a
point of attraction beckoning tourists hither from
afar, but there has been no one place where they
could be taken and shown all the wonderful
resources of this glorious State. The Midwinter fair
was a grand conception, and the various jubilees and
fiestas held from time to time have all been good in
their way, but we want something better, first to
attract attention and then to hold it.

one knows better than I the advantages
of an attractive exhibition. It bring:!
hundreds of people here â some to coma
and see and go away again with broad
ened ideas, others to come, be fasei-.
nated with our wonderful resources and
make their homes here. Of course thia
makes things better for us, if properly
managed, otherwise it will increase our
sufferings. While the Midwinter Fair
was a great thing for California in
many ways, it was not the benefit to
the workingman it might have been, aa
too many workers were brought here
from the outside, and being without re
sources were willing to take employ
ment at almost any figure. As a natural
result I believe there was only one ex
hibit placed by union men, and that,
strange to say, was the Chinese exhibit.
If the management of the coming ex
position will make arrangements to
give lfreal union workers a fair show-
Ing, then I think the support of aU local
workingmen can be safely counted
upon, and this, I think, will be found
to mean really more than it may ap
pear to mean on the face.
Myers, the fireman on Davis* engine,
is badly injured and will not live.
The colliding trains were a mixed
train going west and a freight going
east. One report says it was a head
end collision, while another gives out
the information that the freight backed
into .the mixed train.
The dead and injured were placed in
the care of Dr. J. B. Renshaw of
Needles, who is a deputy Coroner, and
who this morning wired for County
Coroner A. C. Keating. The Coroner
left for the scene of the wreck on the
noon train.
The dead engineers were well known
in this city. Coomes was an old rail
road man and had been in the employ
of the company for many years. At
one time he was master mechanic in
the railroad shops at Needles. Davis
also was an old employe and owned
property in National City.
Rumors differ as t8 who is at fault,
blame being attached by some to the
operator at Needles, and by others to
the trainmen.
The sensational report that the over
land was one of the wrecked trains was
incorrect, as the accident did not occur
on the main line.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
PAN JOSE, Feb. 18.â There were
Numerous witnesses before the Grand
Jury to-day, who were examined as to
â¢what they knew relative to the
charges of bribery which Mrs. John H.
Scully had made in an affidavit on last
Saturday. All the evidence that has
"been already published In The Call was
placed in the hands of the inquisitorial
body. This included the affidavit of
Mrs. Scully, the $50 note given by Mr.
and Mrs. Scully to \V. C. Krieg, the
brother of Councilman Julius Krieg,
and one of the orders given by Scully
to the Deputy District Attorney yester
day.
Much to the surprise of every one
Jamlliar with the case, Mrs. Scully,
when called before the Grand Jury, re
fused to impart any information, not
withstanding that in an affidavit made
but a few days ago she had unequivo
cally stated that she had paid to W. C.
Krieg the sum of $150 in gold coin and
a note of $50 to procure for her hus
band a position on the police force of
San Jose. In the affidavit she also
etated that the sum of money thus paid
to W. C. Krieg was to go to Council
man Julius Kreig, Councilman Dittus
and others who had the power to bring
about the result she desired. It is
believed that her silence was the re-
Bult of a peace effected with her hus
band.
John Scully, who had confessed at
different times that his position had j
been procured by the use of money, |
also stood mute when brought into the j
presence of the Grand Jurors.
There is enough evidence, however, i
it is stated, to bring about the convic- !
tion of the accused persons, including j
y[r. art^ airs. Scully. Had the latter
pair made a clean breast of the affair
to-day it is probable that they would j
have been shown the greatest degree of
leniency, for the sake of the evidence i
they would have given that would have
aided in the conviction of those who are j
considered more guilty than they. Even
should they at this late day decide to j
stand with justice they might yet be j
accorded every consideration by the j
Grand Jury and the prosecuting officer
of the county.
The hearing in this case was not com
pleted to-day, but it will in all proba
bility to-morrow.
Before the present Grand Jury ad- j
Journs officialdom in both the City Hall j
and the Courthouse, from roof to base- i
ment will get a shaking up such as will i
nark the sitting Grand Jury as a his- ;
torical body. A line of investigation j
â was begun to-day, which, if carried to ',
a logical conclusion, will do more than ;
any one thing to wipe out the stigma '
of corruption that attaches to the mv- j
nicipal administration of San Jose and ]
to the government of Santa Clara [
County.
VICTIM OF THE LYING HABIT.
Mission - Street Monarch of the
Fakers at Its Old Tricks.
ADD LOCAL WAR â
RAN JOSE, Feb. 18.â Habit has seem
ingly become second nature with the
pa/fron-hued faker of Mission street.
Even where there is absolutely nothing
to be gained by indulging in its lost frr
lyli.U the Examiner nowadays -wanton
ly departs from the straight and nar
row path cf truth. Its latest display <â¢*
Its irresistible passion for faking con-
Bists of as pure and unadulterated
a falsehood as was ever credited to a
member of the Sazarac Lying Club.
Here it is:
"We can always count on the Examiner
when the people need assistance. The
people of no city in the State admire it
more than do those of San Jose. We
have watched its -fight in San Francisco
and its position always with the op
pressed. There is no mistaking It, the
Examiner is the people's champion. '-Ke
marks of Colonel Hardy on passage of a
resolution of thanks to the Examiner at
last night's meeting of the San Jose Char
ter Club. â  â $$m
This appeared in this morning's issue
of the Examiner, over a dispatch from j
Fan Jose, giving a report of a meet- ;
ing of the New Charter Club. There is i
absolutely not a single word of truth in j
this. No resolution of thanks to the i
Examiner was passed. A vote of thanks j
was extended to The Call and the Ex- j
aminer, but not a single word was ut- i
tered on the subject by Colonel Hardy j
or any other member of the club, ex- |
cept S. G. Tompkins, who made tho j
motion, and he did not use the words
Quoted nor any to the same effect. All
the members who were present at the
meeting of the New Charter Club last
night are amused or disgusted at the
brazen effrontery of the Monarch of
Journalistic Fakers.
Ordinarily an incident such as this
might be allowed to pass without no
tice, but in the fight the New Charter :
Club has on its hands it cannot afford
to be apparently supported by a news
paper which has got the lying habit so
fastened upon itself that it cannot
break away from it even in a just, no
ble and honest cause, in which there is
absolutely nothing to be gained by in
dulgence in falsifying. Fortunately,
however, it is fully appreciated that
the Examiner's lying is simply for its
self-glorification, and as lying is its ad
mitted forte, it has in this instance
achieved the peculiar kind it so dili
gently seeks.
It is needless to say that the fact is
fully appreciated here that it is try
ing'to sneak into the fight for better
city government under the shadow and
safety of the victory already virtually
â won through the efforts of The Call
during the past several months. Its
co-operation, even at this late time,
â will be welcomed by The Call, the New
charter Club and by all the decent peo
ple of San Jose, if it will only eschew
deliberate faking.

SHAMEFUL COURT RULING
Counsel for the Defense Refusscl the
Privilege or Questioning
Witnesses.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, Feb. 18. â There were riotous
proceedings after the adjournment of
the Zola trial to-day, and M. Zola nar
rowly escaped being lynched by the
mob outside. On leaving the Palace of
Justice, all the officers were applauded
by the crowd outside the building, and
General Pellieux, who descended the
steps bareheaded, was given a recep
tion. Major Esterhazy was greeted
with shouts of "Vive l'Armee!" The
police were powerless to control the
immense crowds and several Jews were
the objects of insults and menaces.
There was a general fight. The mob
threw itself on the Jews, yelling
'"Death to the Jews!" and "Throw
them into the Seine!" Finally the Re
publican guards charged the rioters
and cleared the square.
General Boisdeffre was the first wit
ness called to-day. He confirmed the
I testimony given yesterday by General
Pellieux.
Next Major Esterhazy was called to
: the stand.
"It is said that you are the author of
the bordereau. What have you to ans
| wer?" asked the Judge.
"Firstly," replied the witness, "I have
i a statement to make. On a shadow of
' proof this miserable Dreyfus has ac
cused me of being guilty of his broth
j er's crime. I have been judged by my
! people who have acquitted me, but to
; day I am summoned as a witness so he
may accuse me, when I have no adviser
Ito defend me. I will answer any ques
: tion you put to me, but, as to those
| people," turning to M. Zola and his
I counsel, "I wont reply to them."
This created a sensation.
The Judge then turned to M. Laborle,
inquiring-, "Have you any questions to
ask Major Esterhazy?"
"I am still drawing up my applica
tion," answered M. Laborie, "and I
shall not ask any questions until the
court has given a decision upon i*."
Laborie referred to an application
to cross-question Boisdeffre, which
privilege had been denied him.
"Put your questions immediately,"
exclaimed the Judge, "or you will not
put any."
.At this there were murmurs of dis
approval.
"I can say nothing at this moment,"
replied M. Laborie, "but I protest
against this attitude."
Here the Presiding Judge interrupt
ed counsel, exclaiming:
"What do you say? Major Ester
hazy, resume your seat."
There was prolonged cheering as Ma
jor Esterhazy left the witness stand.
The Judge then suspended the sitting
in order to allow M. Laborie to com
plete his application. The noise in
court was deafening and almost inde
scribable, the prevailing opinion being
that the case was being settled in mili
tary fashion.
When the session was resumed M.
Laborie presented his exceptions,
pointing out that the court had refused
to allow him to question General Bois
deffre without hearing his question.
Counsel protested against this "denial
of justice," and concluded with de
manding the recall of Generals Bois
deffre and Pellleux and Major Ester
hazy.
The Advocate-General reminded th^
court that the Dreyfus affair should
not be mentioned, otherwise, he added,
he would leave the matter in the hands
of the court. Counsel for M. Zola re
torted: "The generals came into court
in full uniform and wearing their dec
orations in order to make speeches for
the prosecution. [Uproar.]
"The defense," M. Laborie added, "is
reproached with attempting to secure
a revision of the Dreyfus case, but the
generals have harangued against a re
vision of the trial of Major Esterhazy,
who was acquitted. Let his judges
bear the responsibility."
Proceeding. M. Laborie alluded to the
"man suffering on Devils Island," add
ing, "though his sufferings doubtless
do not interest the men who are howl
ing at the back of the courtroom."
"Gentlemen of the jury," M. Laborie
said, "I entreat you most earnestly to
rise above the emotions of the misled
public, and to consider that we are
perhaps at a turning point in our his
tory, and that your decision will have
consequences which no one to-day can
measure."
The court then retired to deliberate.
During the suspension of the session
there was a great demonstration in the
courtroom in favor of General Pellieux.
A man who cried "Vive Zola" was set
upon, maltreated and bundled out of
court. When the session was resumed
the Presiding Judge announced that M.
Laborie's demands for the recalls of
General Boisdeffre and Pellleux were
overruled, but that Major Esterhazy
might be recalled if counsel wished.
The major was recalled, took the stand,
turned his back on M. Zola and M. La
borie, and refused to answer their
questions. Colonel Picquart was then
recalled and said that the moment the
Esterhazy inquiry began the suspected
document, calculated to whitewash
Esterhazy, arrived a.t the Ministry of
War. This, he added, was the docu
ment to which General Pellieux ro
ferred, "and," Colonel Picquart said,
"it can be considered a forgery."
General Gonze, who was recalled, af
firmed that the document was authen
tic, but he refused to give any further
particulars.

WALKS FOR TWO
DAYS WITH HIS
TRACHEA SEVERED
With a Horrible Knife Wound in His Throat a
Man Travels From Rutherford
to Napa.
NAPA, Feb. I?.â Valante Domenlco, an Italian, is lying at the
County Infirmary with his trachea almost severed. His throat was
cut by a stranger Wednesday afternoon three miles east of Rutherford,
and the unfortunate man walked all the way from Rutherford on
Thursday. Here he was sent to the Infirmary, where County Physician
Hennessey attended him and sewed up the wound in his throat.
Domenico says that he had started for St. Helena from the ranch of
George Corthay, in Conn Valley. On the way he met two Indians. One
of them asked him for some food, which he at first refused to give, but
on thought he went after the Indian, who had started away, and en
gaged him in conversation. Suddenly the Indian drew a big knife and
slashed at Domenlco's throat, severing the trachea. The Indian then
lied.
Domenico, despite his horrible wound, continued on his Journey. He
slept over night in a barn near Yountville, and came on to Napa yes
terday. He had lost much blood and was very weak, but it Is believed
he will recover.
FARM TRACTS
UNDER WATER
Rivers in Western Wash
ington Overflow Their .
Banks.
Great Damage to Railway
Property in the Flood
Districts.
People Compelled to Leave Their
Homes and Hurry to the
Highlands.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA. Feb. IS.â Many rivers in
Western Washington are overflowing,
their rapid rise being caused by heavy
rains and chinook winds, which have
melted the snows in the foothills. The
Palouse River in Eastern Washington
was higher yesterday and to-day than
it had been for six years, and the lower
part of Palouse was flooded. The water
reached the floor of the bridge of Main
street, near the depot, and covered the
streets to a depth of three feet for a
considerable distance. Houses and
burns on the flats were surrounded by
water and families living near the de
pot were forced to move out, the water
reaching to the windows of the houses.
Traffic on the Northern Pacific
branch between Moscow, Idaho, and
Julietta will not be resumed before
Monday. The damage done in that sec
tion by the high water is the greatest
for years. Workmen on the extension
to Lewiston, Idaho, have been em
ployed on the damaged track, a force of
from 600 to 1000 men and four work
trains being at the work. Superintend
ent Gilbert is directing the operations.
Most of the damage to the track is be
tween Kendrlck and Julietta.
Many farms are submerged in valleys
through the Palouse grain district and
some stock has been drowned.
The only fatality yet reported is that
of Henry Galnaugh, aged nine, who
was drowned in the Newaukum, three
miles from Chehalis, the valley where
they lived being flooded. In the mid
dle of the stream a raft on which he
rode became unmanageable and the
boy fell into the river. His father was
unable to reach him in time to save his
life.
Farms in Cowlitz, Chehalis, Puyal
lup, Steeck and "White River Valleys
are under water and stock is being
moved to the uplands. There are miles
of flooded country between Tacoma
and Seattle. Main line and Seattle
trains are running on time, however,
because the Northern Pacific has re
cently put in high iron bridges over
the streams it crosses.
This is the fourth flood Western
Washington has had since September.
It is considered important as empha
sizing the need of better protection of
the forests, particularly at the heads
of streams, as a preventive of floods.
The damage by floods has been in
creasing yearly in this State, and the
National Government is now being
urged to put into effect stringent for
estry regulations as the best protective
measure possible.
THOMAS D. STIMSON'S WILL.
How the Los Angeles Capitalist Dis-

the lot and building at Third and Spring
streets. The remainder of the estate is
to be held and managed in trust until the
youngest grandchild at the time of tes
tator's death reaches 21: then the estate
is to be divided between the testator's
children and grandchildren, share and
share alike. The codicil provides for the
navment of $44,000 to testator's daughter,
Mrs Fay. as $56,000 of the $100,000 meant

DAVID FELSENHELD DEAD.
San Diegan Succumbs to the Effects

WALNUT CREEK, Feb. 18.â A letter
has just been received by A. Lebrecht of
this place from Munich, Bavaria, an
nouncing the death there of David Fel
senheld, who was traveling in Europe.
His demise was the result of an opera
tion. Ills remains were sent to Hotha,
where they were cremated.
"Little Dave" Felsenheld opened the
fir?t bank in Idaho, at Silver City, in 1865,
with Martin Herman, a well-known stock
broker. A few years later he removed to
San Diego, where he and his brother.
Max, opened a large mercantile house. He
was associated with Colonel Tom Scott in
projecting the Texas and Pacific Railroad,
and it was mainly through his efforts that
the road was built. He was prominent in
affairs concerning the city of San Diego,
and was always to the fore when his ser
vices wÂ«re required for the public good.
He was 60 years of age.
SPALDINC NOW
A SOCIALIST
L_os Angeles' Editor's Pe
culiar Change of
Front.
Advocates Government Control
of All Public Utili
ties.
However, He Still Opposes the Ac
quisition by the City of Its
Water Plant
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 18.â W. A.
Spalding, the editor and manager of
the Herald, one of the three dally jour
nals In the newspaper syndicate in
this city that has done so much in Its
endeavors to delay and retard munici
pal control and operation of the city's
water distributing plant, took a stand
this evening which will create more or
less of a sensation. He declared him
self an advanced socialist, and, mak
ing the declaration, he took a posi
tion which caused his remarks to be
vigorously applauded by the most ad
vanced believers in the theory of uni
versal co-operation.
Mr. Spaldins, despite the fact that
he has, through the Herald, opposed
and antagonized all movements and ef
forts looking to the public control of
the city's water plant, now held by the
Los Angeles Water Company, on a rea
sonable and just basis, to-night told
themembersof theÃ.-r'orm League that
the social conditions existing in this
country to-day called for a radical
change, or there would be a repetition
of the French revolution on American
soil.
Considering the fact that through
the Herald Mr. Spalding has not oniy
thrown every obstacle possible into the
way of municipal control of the water
plant, but has vilified and defamed
every individual in public and private
life and every newspaper that took a
bold and courageous stand for the peo
ple in that important struggle, his open
advocacy to-night of public control of
the railroads, telegraph and other pub
lic utilities comes not only as a sur
prise, but with a belief on the part of
many who heard his address that he
does not mean what he says
Editor Spalding talked to the Reform
League to-night for over an hour He
took occasion during the course of his
remarks to lambaste both of the old
political parties, which he accused of
deceiving the people for years on the
tariff question by dividing that issue
when, as a matter of fact, the differ
ences between the two parties on that
question were trivial, amounting he
said, to only about 7 per cent increase
or decrease in the duties on imports.
In the last national campaign, he
said, the old parties divided the people
on the silver coinage issue, the settle
ment of which, one way or the other
was no cure for the existing conditions!
which he thought to be dangerous to
the perpetuity of the republic.
His advice was that a change should
be effected in the social system, but
just how this could be brought about
he did not pretend to say. The settle
ment of the tariff or the silver ques
tion would not improve conditions ac
cording to his reasoning. He made a
strong defense of the adoption of pa
ternalism by the Government, whereby
the unemployed could be given an op
portunity by the Government to labor
If this was not done, he feared, there
would be another Coxey army move
ment in the country, only much strong
er and greater in numbers than the one
of a few years ago.
In fact, Spalding took the most radi
cal ground in favor of socialism of any
speaker that has been heard in this
community in a long time. The sur
prise of the Los Angeles public at this
departure of the editor of the Herald
will be great.
When Mayor Rnyrif-r advocated In his
mesage a proposition for the city to
take possession of its water plant at
the expiration of the present lease with
the water company, the value of the
company's improvements to be judi
cially determined. Mr. Spalding, in the
Herald, denounced the policy as pirati
cal. Every time the Mayor and Coun
cilmen Grider and Hutchison took a
position to force the water company to
come to terms, Spalding and the Herald
have denounced these faithful public
servants as advocates of confiscation,
and has in every way belittled their ef
forts and endeavored to place them in a
false light before the people. In the
newspaper syndicate controlled by the
water company the Herald has been
the strongest defender of the water
company's scheme to mulct the people
of $2,000,000.
And now its editor becomes an ad
vanced socialist.

winters ago no belle has been more in
demand in society at dinners and balls.
Even before she was formally intro
duced to society she was chosen by
Miss Consuelo Vanderbilt to act as
one of her bridesmaids when Miss Van
derbilt became the Duchess of Marl
borough.
Miss Duer Is tall, a brilliant bru
nette of clear-cut features and in
herits to a great degree the wit and
cleverness of her grandfather, the late
"William R. Travers. She is also one
of the descendants of the famous Lady
Kitty Duer, daughter of the Earl of
Sterling, one of the belles of the ca
lonial days of New York.
Young Mr. Mackay is a comparative
stranger in New York, where he has
lived little more than two years, during
which time he has scarcely been in
society, owing to the death of his
brother, William Mackay. He is just
past 23 years of age, and was born in
San Francisco.
No date has been set for the marriage
of Miss Duer and Mr. Mackay, al
though it is altogether probable that
this will take place early in June, and
for that occasion Mrs. Mackay will
come over from London, arriving here
about May 1. This engagement, which
had been constantly denied for some
weeks by both families, was formally
announced to-day on the return of
young Mr. Mackay from a trip to
h lorida, where he had been for the
past three weeks. Miss Duer's engage
ment ring is a superb solitaire pearl,
which is her favorite gem.
About the middle of next month Mr.
Mackay will take a party to Montreal.
The party will be chaperoned by Mrs.
Richard Irvin. and will include, among
others, Miss Fair. Miss Daisy Leiter,
Philip Lydig and Reginald Ronalds.

WOMEN TALK
OF SECESSION
Trouble in the Ranks ofi
the Equal Suffrage
Association.
Santa Clara Clubs May With
draw from the State
Organization.
Claim That They Are Not Granted
Fair Representation by Ita
Officials.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Feb. 18.â There were some
interesting proceedings at the annual
conventions of the Santa Clara County
Equal Suffrage Club at the Unitarian
church to-day, and threats of seceding
from the State club were made. There
was a good attendance, and the various
clubs throughout the county were rep
resented by delegates. The discussion
of the State convention at San Fran
cisco last year stirred up much dissat
isfaction, which almost amounted to a
declaration of independence from the
authority of the State Equal Suffrage
Association. A number of the acts of
the authorities of the State organiza
tion, of which Mrs. Mary A. Swift of
San Francisco is president, were called
into question, and threats of secession
were made.
The principal complaints were
against the actions of the powers that
be at the session of the State conven
tion at San Francisco last year. It is
stated that the San Francisco dele
gates managed to secure a monopoly
of all the advantages as well as the
honors through the union of clubs
throughout the State, while the clubs in
the southern part of the State especial
ly were ignored almost entirely as far
as being granted a proper representa
tion was concerned.
It was stated that the authorities at
San Francisco seemed perfectly willing
that the clubs in Santa Clara County
should contribute quite a neat sum to
the general State fund, but there was a
corresponding lack of willingness on
the part of the State officials to allow
the clubs in this county to have any
voice as to haw the funds should be ex
pended.
It was pointed out that taxation
â without representation was the iden
tical wrong of which women were now
complaining as regards their relation
ship to political affairs in general, and
the government of the country in par
ticular, and they did not care to con
tinue an alliance with a State organiza
tion of their own sex that itself prac
ticed these very wrongs. The com
plaints that are made against the State
association of clubs are along the same
lines as those that were complained of
by our forefathers in the Revolution,
and if some of the offending State offi
cers should come to San Jose to at
tempt to hold a tea party here it is
very much to- be feared that some of
their tea would soon be thrown over
board.
No. decisive action was taken as re
gards the threatened breach in the
State organization, but Mrs. J. M. Mc-
Kee of the Willow Glen Club, in behalf
of her organization, presented the
formal resignation of that club as an
auxiliary to the State organization. It
was stated that the Willow Glen Club
was unwilling longer to pay a rather
high assessment to the' State Associa
tion without having any privilege as
far as having a voice in the disposition
of the funds was concerned. Mrs. Mc-
Kee was one of the delegates from
Santa Clara County to the recent State
convention.
No action was taken in the matter
of the resignation of Willow Glen Club
from the State organization.
The Santa Clara County Equal Suf
frage Club elected the following officers
for the ensuing year: President, Mrs.
A. Li. Corbert of Palo Alto; vice-presi
dent, Mrs. A. K. Spero: recording sec
retary, Mrs. E. G. Dyer of Palo Alto:
corresponding secretary, Mrs. Dr. Alida
C. Avery (re-elected); treasurer, Miss
Fiora Smith (re-elected); auditors, Mrs.
Orvis and Miss Bolis.
Bankruptcy Bill Argued.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 18.â In the House
to-day the debate on the bankruptcy bill
was resumed, the speakers being Sulzer
(D.) of New York. Strode (R.) of Ne
braska, Connelly <R.) of Illinois. Rixey
(D.) of Virginia, Grosvenor (R.) of Ohio.
Sayers (D.) of Texas and Day (R.) of

TAE FIELD OF SPORT.
COLLEGE FIELD
MEETS
AND BALL GAMES.
The prospective event which is attract
ing the most attention at the University
of California is the annual contest be
tween the freshmen and sophomore
classes on track and field. Last year the
two classes did not engage in contentious
rivalry for athletic honors, on account of
the paucity of athletes in the class of 'M.
The century class '00, with a legion of
able athlete's, was more feared than re
epected by their sophomores, and a con
test was declined.
But conditions have altered. Although
the present sophomores are a strong ag- I
gregation, athletically considered, they I
have worthy rivais in the first class at
college. The freshmen will dispute with
them the title of athletic supremacy early
In March, and aii are of the opinion that |
the games will be the most closely con
tested ever seen on the California cinder
path. There is another reason why the
games are of particular interest to the
college men, for out Of the interclass
meeting much undeveloped talent is ex
pected to be discovered, and afterward
utilized in the formation or" the Varsity
track team which will enter the lists with
Stanford early in April.
Much speculation is indulged in on the
outcome of the sorints in which Drum,
champion short-u.stance runner of isy7,
Woolsey and DieÂ«.son are entered. Wool
sey is "the young athlete who shattered
so many records in the academic league.
Dicksori, who, with Woolsey, will repre
sent the freshman class, came to Cali
fornia from the Northwest with a repu
tation which is second to none. He is
rated as a 10 1-5 seconds man. which time
he can do, according to the watches in the
north, whenever he feels so inclined.
The responsibility of nipping in the bud
the ambitions of these young sprinters
rests on the redoubtable Drum. He will
be entered in all three sprints.
In the haif-mile and mile the freshmen
have Mozier. and in him the trainers and
the wise ones think they have discovered [
another Achilles. His fieetness of foot, ,
his style and his endurance are such as I
to carry him to the fore among thu long- i
distance men. To offset him Captain
Drum of the sophomores has induced |
Squires, the great cyder, to train forboth
the long-distance runs. Squires, from the
success in this new venture, bids fair to
be as nimble with his legs on the cinders
as well as the pedals. In practice he has
covered the two distances in exception-
Ally fast time.
The one event of the field day which
promises the most intense excitement is '
the mile walk. Westerfleld will represent
the sophomores and Walsh the freshmen.
It is Walsh who holds a record in this
event, which on this coast is second to
that of only one other heel and toe i
athlete, Horace Coffin. Westerfeld, it
â¢will be remembered, tied Adams of Stan- ,
ford for first place last year after losing
a shoe on the first lap and walking the
rest of the distance with the cuticle com- I
pletely torn off and cinders buried in the i
flesh. This will be Walsh's lirst oppor- i
tunity in college games.
In the hurdles the freshmen have a j
number of men whose abilities have not i
yet been tried. The sophomores will run
DawÃOn and Crocker in the sticks.
For the weights the freshmen have
Woolsey, who has put the shot 41 feet.
Guibersen and Tolman, '01. are on the
books for both the shot-put and ham- j
mer-throwing events. In the broad jump,
Broughton '01 will try to repeat his per
formance of 22 feet. The pole vault is
conceded to Hoffman '01.
While the greatest activity has been
displayed on the cinder track, baseball
has languished somewhat durintr the pres-'
ent week on the California diamond. This
is due to the expected coming of the new
California coach. Garret Cochran of
Princeton. On Monday Cochran will take
the baseball men in hand, and they will
be under his tutelage the rest of the sea
son. What plan he will work on is not
yet known. As a baseball player Coch
ran's reputation is only exceeded by his
fame on the gridiron. Contrary to the
custom of former years, it is believed that
Cochran will collect the football material
before the summer and put them through
some preliminary work.
The new triangular league gives every
evidence of being a success. Last Sat
urday the attendance was poor owing to
a game on the Berkeley campus. To-day
California will appear in its Initial match
game with tne alumni team. The alumni
will line up the same men that played
last Saturday. A large delegation will
be over to see the blue and gold in the
heat of battle, as well as their new ath
letic instructor, Cochran, who will um
pire the game.
At Berkeley the college nine has not
yet lined up. In any match game. Even
the professional school men have not yet
come over for practice. The men In the
professional schools who are candidates
for places on the team are: Husted, law;
Sykes. law; Bride, law, formerly first
baseman for Santa Clara; and Kuster,
dental. Captain Hoag Intends to play
about fifteen men in the game to-day.
The pitchers will be Kaarberg and
Symmes. Mien will catch. Hoag will try
an infield position this year in order to
captain the team. For the outfield selec
tions will be made from McLaren,Cheese
borough, Belding and Dean. Bride, Kus
ter, Hoag and Baer will probably be the
Infield.
At Palo Alto the season has not ad
vanced as rapidly as at Berkeley. The
baseball team i.Â« out for practice nightly
and much Improvement has been noted
The track team is just past the prelimin
ary state. In another week it will be pos
sible to estimate its comparative strength
with the team of last .year and the pres
ent California track aggregation. Trial
field days w... be held at Stanford in
Marchâ lnterclass meets and a general
university field day.
TWO SUNDAYS MORE
FOR DUCK SHOOTING.
The duck and.quail shooting season will
end with this month, and, as there are
still large numbers of -birds' on the bay
marshes, first-class sport' should ; be en
joyed up to' the last day of the burning
of powder.' :-â¢â â .â¢'. - â¢ â¢ â â  .

ROAD RACING AND
TOURING
SEASON OPENED.
In wheeling circles this week the all
absorbing topic has been the approach
ing 25-mile road race of the California
Associated Cycling Clubs, to be held on
Washington's birthday over the San Le
andro triangle. There are eighty-eight
entrants, whose handicaps will probably
vary from nothing to eight minutes, ac
cording to Handicapper Smyth's estima
tion of their abilities. â¢ .
The touring season will open about the
Ist of March, and shortly thereafter will
come the roadbook of the C. A. C. C, for
which we have long been- waiting, and
which is expected to prove particularly
valuable to all who indulge in the pleas

between the Bay City Wheelmen and the
Olympic Club Wheelmen. Both teams will

long-existing rivalry between these two
big wheeling organizations insures a
snappy game. The line-up will be as fol

Spalding. Boeckmann. Schilling and .oth
ers are all interested in "pups," They
handle them rather carelessly, however,

â  Habitual "Park and Cliff" riders and
late Sunday morning wheel enthusiasts
may have a change if they would like to
take a run down the bay road and to the
lakes back of Uncle Tom's Cabin to-mor
row. A select party of over twenty ladies
and gentlemen who have not been riding
much this season are going to take along
lunch and make the, trip, and invite any
one so inclined. to accompany them.
They start from Wynne's drug, store,
â¢Twenty-second and Folson streets at 9 a.
m. sharp. No trouble will be experienced
in keeping the pacemaker in sight. Four
tandem couples will be in the aggregation.
The roads were never betterâ no dust, and
smooth. This run down by the Six-Mile
House, along the bay shore and through
South San Francisco always proves most
enjoyable and acts as a first-class tonic
for any one having an early dinner en
gagement. This same party made the trip
to Antloch, described In last Saturday's
Call, and- pronounce that journey one of
the best country rides within a 1 radius of
fifty miles of this city.' They are good at
discovering new trips - for wheelmen,
which will be given from.time to time in
these columns as fast as they are ."dis
covered." . H. : W. SPALDING.
BANDBALL PLAYERS
IN ACTIVE PRACTICE.
Phil Casey, the champion handball
player of the world, and James Dunn, his
partner, will positively appear in a game
to be played at Phil Ryan's court on
March 17. Dunne has already departed
from Now York and will remain in Loe
Angeles for a few weeks prior to his ar
rival In this city. He telegraphed ex-As
sessor James C. Nealon a few days ago
that Champion Casey will leave New
York for this city about March 8, and
that the two big guns will be ready to try
conclusions with the best brace of local
ball smashers San Francisco can produce
on Ireland's great holiday.
Dunne has a son who is acknowledged
to be the crack amateur ball player of
the Eastern States. ll e will also be here
ami if any of the local athletes may
feel disposed to give him a race, doubt
less B game or a series of games can be
arranged.
Jack Bonnett is saying very little, but
report states that he is seriously thinking.
Handball games scheduled for Sunday

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1898.
KAMSIN, THE EAMOUS BREAD-WINNER OF LOUIS EZELL'S STABLE-
GREEN AND RYAN
WILL MEET
FRIDAY EVENING.
On Friday evening, the 25th lnst., the
National Club, or, at least, its master of
ceremonies, Sir William Jordan, will in
troduce to the sports of this city two
well-known fistic celebrities, namely:
George Green of California and Tommy
Ryan, the great Eastern welter-weight.
Those knights of the knuckle will box
twenty rounds in Woodward's Pavilion;
that i's, of course, provided a knockout
will not be registered in either man's
favor before the limit round is announced.
Green has been training hard for this
battle. He has not taken off any flesh, as
he expects to enter the ring weighing
as much as possible. His system of exer
cise has been changed to answer the oc
casion. Instead of reducing weight to
reach a certain figure, as formerly. Green
Is training solely to gain lung power. He
says that he does not expect to gain any
thing in cleverness. "All I require," said
George, "is strength, backed up by a
good bellows, and as I am feeling in great
trim now I expect to prove to my friends
on Friday night that the defeat I sus
tained at the hands or fists of Walcott
has not put me back one bit. You know,
I have always given away weight, and it
was on that account Walcott whipped
me; but I will meet him again some day.
and you will hear of the turning of
tables." , Â ,
Ryan is training in Oakland. He Is now
ready for action, and if he will fight,
as the saying goes, up to his record, the
sports who Intend to witness the mill can
count upon enjoying a rare treat in fisti
cuffs.
The Eastern lad Is about as clever as
any man can hope to be. He is as quick
as the proverbial cat, and his record is
without blemish.
The preliminaries will consist of one six
and two four-round contests. The prices
of admission are: Boxes, 6; reserved seats,
$3; first three rows in gallery, $2, and
general admission, $1.
The syndicate of sporting men which Is
endeavoring to bring about a second
meeting between Corbett and Fitzslm
mons has about given up hope of ever
inducing Champion Fitzsimmons to enter
the ring again.
"Fitz" has taken an oath that he will
never fight again, and it is almost safe
to say that he will keep his word. Of
course, Corbett will accept any kind of
an offer. If he cannot succeed in get
ting the man who whipped him in Carson
into the ring again, he will not lose any
thing by free advertising, and doubtless
that is what artful James is after. Should
Fitzsimmons break all the promises he
has made and consent to fight Corbett
again, then the sporting fraternity will
have good reason to believe that "there
is something very rotten in Denmark."
The Seal-Poachers Escaped.
The revenue cutter Rush returned yes
terday afternoon from her chase after
two Canadian sealers which hart put into
Bodega Bay for repairs and stores. Col
lector Jackson was Informed of the ar
rival of the Rush and of the fact that she
had dropped anchor off SauÃalito, but did
not get any news of her doings. As she
had nothing In tow. It Is believed she
found no trace of the poaching vessels
TENNIS PLAYERS
TO MEET
IN TOURNAMENT.
George and Robert Whitney are spend
ing a week at their uncle's home in
Placer County.
Dick Adams of the California Club and
Percy Murduck will play their long de
ferred match at the Alameda Tennis
courts to-day â that is, if the weather per
mits. Murdoch succumbed to young
Adams in their first meeting, but the
latter thought the bitumen pavement
made his feet sore. He, therefore, asked
for a return match to be played on the
Bellevue dirt court, to which Adams
agreed. A few days ago the latter re
ceived a letter from Murdoch stating that
he was willing to try his fortunes on a
bitumen court, and the match will take
place at the Morton-street station courts
to-day. Murdoch will be among his
friends who will doubtless turn out in
large numbers, but this will not discon
cert Adams, as he will be handled by that
veteran of the net, Joe Daily.
Jack Hoffman's pleasing countenance is
once more seen on the local courts. He
lately returned from the mines, and,
hearing of the great interest being taken
in toe game, donned his slippers and ten
nis togs and hied himself to the Cali
rornia courts, where he was again elected
to membership. Jack, a few years ago,
was considered one of the coming play
ers among the youngsters.
a single handicap tennis tournament
lias been arranged for Tuesday next and
already there are a great many entries to
ky * i he valuable prizes offered by the
board of directors. Joe Daily will handi
cap the players and he promises that the
experts will have to "play tennis" to de
reat the less expert. Those who have en
tered are: Walter McGavin, Joseph G.
Hooper Woerner Stauf, Dr. C. B, Root,
Halph Bliven, J. O. Blanchard. J. D. Mc-
Gavin, Harry Weihe, S. H. Adams. A.
( arrigan. w. O'Connor, Lieutenant F. Â«*..
Wllfox, B. P. Oliver and J. A. Code.
Miss Stauf, sister of the vice-president,
was out during the week with Dally as
her opponent. The latter thinks Miss
btauf plays a good game, and marvels at
It, as the lady has never handled a rac
quet before.
Lieutenant Wilcox, U. S. A., was defeat
ed by Woerner Stauf, the club's heavy
weight, in one of the closest and most ex
citing matches of the week. Wilcox has
always been looked upon as being a good
player, and Staufs victory caused a big
surprise. He seems to be playing in bet
ter form and should surprise some of tht>
confident ones in the tournament on
Washington's birthday.
No matter how blustering the day is,
the courts are crowded with the lady
members of the club. It is a pleasing sight
to see them gracefully skimming 1 after the
elusive ball, with hair awry and rosy
cheeks.
Among the players who have been out
are Miss Adah Horr. Miss Manning, Miss
Farnsworth, Miss Zeila Mann. Miss A. Ei
sen. Miss Clark and Miss Bowman.
Miss Bernice Drown is up for member
ship.
The lines of the court, the fences and
the club house will shortiy be treated to
a coat of paint.

Hospital Reception.
There was a large gathering of charit

NET FISHERMEN
MUST BE
MORE CAREFUL.
Unless heavy rains should fall between
now and next Saturday, Russian River
should be in good order again for steel
head fishing.
Latest Intelligence from Duncans Mills
Is to the effect that the river is clearing
rapidly, and as the bar has been open
since the first day of the freshet, the
fishes are passing in from the ocean and
disporting in the deep pools where they
rest before making a long run to the
head waters.
Deputy Fish Commissioner Cross has
been doing excellent service recently by
confiscating nets and making things
somewhat torrid for the lawbreakers.
A few days ago he learned that one of
the fishermen who persist in catching
steelheads contrary to law boasted that
he would cast his net in a deep pool
near Russian River Station and defy any
body to molest him.
Cross muttered something to himself
which was interpreted by a brother
deputy to mean, "I'll be If he'll
do it," and arming himself with a shot
gun, he Journeyed in the direction of
the place where he expected to meet with
a hot time.
Cross secreted himself in the under
growth near the pool, and there awaited
results. It was growing dark when the
fisherman appeared in his boat and cast
out his net, after placing which in
position, the owner sculled his craft to
the shore and with gun in hand stood
guard over the "fish catcher."
Deputy Cross, a man who is as fear
less as the warship Oregon, quickly stole
down the bank of the stream to where
his boat was under cover, and stepping
boldly into it rowed up to the pool and
hauled in the net, almost under the nose
of the fisherman who was guarding his
treasure.
Not a word was exchanged nor a shot
fired to disturb the solitude. The net was
conilscated and doubtless . its owner
thought that the best policy was not to
interfere with the officer of "the law, who
was but doing his duty.
Fishermen should remember that it ts
unlawful to catch steelheads by means of
nets now. The law reads:
"Every person who, at any time takes
or catches any trout, except with hook
and line, is guilty of a misdemeanor; pro
vided, however, that steelhead trout (sal
mon) may be taken in tide water, between
the Ist day of May and the Ist day of
February of the following year, with law
ful nets; and a lawful net shall be a net
that, when placed in the water is unse
cured and free to float wfth the current or
tide, and the meshes of which are, when
drawn closely together and measured in
side the knot, not less than seven and
one-half inches in length.
"Nothing in this section shall prohibit
the possession, at any time, of steelhead
trout (salmon) when taken in tide water
with hook and line."â Extracts from sec
tion G32, California Fish and Game Laws
It Is not to be supposed that the Fish
Commissioners can, with the small force
of officers at their command, patrol this
great State and do themselves justice;
but they can accomplish much neverthe
less by giving strict attention to places
that are within easy reach of this city,
where transgressions of the law are re
ported to be common.
The Coast Advocate of Halfmoon Bay
on February 16 stated: "Do we need a
Game Warden? Three hundred and for
ty-six steelhead trout were illegally
caught with seine and spear at Pescadero
during the past week. It seems that the
law may- be broken with impunity on the
coast side."
Some nice fish were taken last Sunday
in the tide waters of Sonoma Creek. Jules
Berges caught one and Harry Baum three

WILL PLAY BALL FOR
JIMMY ARLETTS BENEFIT.
Jimmy Arlett fell from the roof of the
old Starr mill at Port Costa a month ago
and was severely injured. His friends
have arranged a baseball game to be
played at Central Park to-morrow for
his benefit, between the Heeseman and
Reliance teams. As Jimmy has made
a big name for himself on the
baseball field and gridiron it is
expected that his many followers
will attend the game and swell the
funds, which will relieve him of worry
during his inactivity. Arlett was a mem
ber of the Reliance team, and occunierl
the position of shortstop. As such he did
very clever work, and was a strong mem
ber of that aggregation. In football he
played quarter and half on the famous
Reliance team. His daring runs and
clever tackling earned him a place in the
hearts of the Athenians, who are ex
pected to turn out to-morrow in great

Alumni expect to retrieve the game lost
to Stanford- last Saturday by the close
score of 3 to 5, by defeating California,

The Government's Domain.
The Commissioner of the General Land Office
has stibmitted his report to the Secretary of
the Interior. Compared with last year, it
shows a decrease of 3298 homestead entries,
aggregating 3T5.625 acres. Quite proportionate
to this is the falling off in general health
when no effort is made to reform irregularltv
of the bowels. This can easily be accom
plished with the aid of Hostetter's Stomach
Bitters, also a remedy for malaria, dyspepsia
rheumatism and liver trouble. '
THE SOUTH ENDS
ARRANGE
A CLUB REGATTA.
The South Ends are making prepara
tions for their first inter-club regatta
which will be held over the Long Bridge
course about the middle of March. The
object of this regatta will be to give the
new members an idea of racing and also
to select material for the different crews.
At the last meeting ten applicants were
admitted to membership and three in
itiated. The club now has over 130 mem
bers.
"Doc" Dennis has a new opponent In
the field who will make him hustle for
championship honors. The star is Len
Hausler, a recent addition to the South
Ends. Hausler was out in his shell last
Sunday and displayed remarkable speed.
Emile Blumheim, of the Willamette
Rowing Club of Portland, says that he
is not in love with the cold waters of
our bay. Blumheim capsized while row
ing off the oil wharf last Sunday morn
ing, and had occasion to remain in the
water about ten minutes until towed
ashore by Jim Feehan, who was close
by when the accident occurred.
Captain Will Thomas has his eye on
Charlie Jenkins, William Barry, Charles
Skelly, C. E. Creighton, Herbert Haw
kins and James Feehan for members of
the junior crew.
The painting of the handball court will
be commenced next Sunday, and Presi
dent Scully has notified the members to
report at the boat house at 8:30 o'clock
with paint brushes and their mothers*
best milk pail, when the work will be
commenced.
The South Ends and Ariels will play a
match game of baseball on the first Sun
day in March.
A committee from the club will visit
Mirabelle Park, on the Northern Pacific
Railroad, to-morrow to make arrange
ments for the annual picnic which will
be held in May.
The Ariels are not at a loss for fresh
material to choose from, for within the
past six month? the membership has al
most doubled. Two junior crews will rep
resent the club this season. The Turn
Verein crew has been practicing for the
past three months and has developed
great speed. The second crew will be
composed of the following men: Dan
O'Connell. J. E. Reilly. Frank Lieb and
A. W. Taylor. They will have the ad
vantage of the coaching of Eugene Flan
ders, who is looked upon as being one of
the best coaches in the country.
The new senior crew took its initial
spin last Sunday. All the men are thor
ough oarsmen, and it is thought they are
an improvement on the past senior crews
The men are: R. Ellis, William Howe,
Joseph Hannan and James O'Connell,-
Frank Wilson, who has been limbering
up for the past two weeks preparatory' to
entering the lists for senior honors, met
with a severe accident to his right hand
a few days ago, and it will be some time
before he will be able to resume training
Charles McAuliffe and F. M. Kelley
loom up as possible entries for the junior
skiff.
The club's junior crew of '96 rowed to
gether again for the nrst time in a year
N. J. Prendergast pulled stroke, J R^
Bockman afterwaist, Al Racouillat for
ward, and Johnson Hardy bow. The Ein
tracht crew challenged them to a spin
which was accepted. For probably a mile
the old crew gained about three boat
lengths, but the lack of training told and
the husky German crew pulled ahead
They were so elated with their victory
that they immediately challenged tha
other crews.
Bockman and Prendergast will devote
all their time to skiff and shell work
The Ariels intend letting a contract for
a new racing barge.
Pape of the Dolphins tried the Triton
Club's new skiff last Sunday and found it
to be very fast. He is having one built by
Twigg. J
The Alameda senior will l>e manned by
E. P. Hadcock, William Hansen, Atwood-
Webb and F. Ayres.
The Alamedas have material for two
junior crews. Three candidates weigh in
the neighborhood of 200 pounds. One crew
will probably be manned by Ed Hunter,
Greenleaf. Meyer and George Lewis.
Chet Ayres will represent the club in
the senior skiff events this season.
Jacob Lewis may take up single rowing
again. He was a member of last year's
senior crew which made such a splendid
showing against the South End Midgets.
Quarters for the Insane.
Chief Lees does not like the proposition
to utilize the premises underneath the
Sheriff's office as temporary quarters for
the insane. The necessity of having the
insane away from the other patients in
the Receiving Hospital has been appar
ent for a long time, and now that there
is every chance of making a change Chief
Lees steps in and raises an objection be
cause the proposed new quarters are at
present occupied by Corpofal Russell, the
carpenter and designer for the police de
partment. Yesterday the Chief and
Health Officer O'Brien, Supervisor Clin
ton and Corporal Russell inspected the
present quarters, and the Chief thought
that they were quite suited for the pur
pose, but the hospital authorities do not
agree with him.

Saloonkeeper Briese
" Blows Out His .
Brains.
He First, However, Mor
tally Wounded Mrs. â 'â 
May Barnum.
It Was Jealousy That Prompted
Him to Commit the Awful
Deed.
.REFUSED TO MARRY HIM.
The Dying Woman Makes a Full
Statement About the
Tragedy.
Mad, blind and fearful jealousy tells
the story of another tragedy. Robert
Briese, the proprietor of â¢â¢Bob's Place,"
rant avenue, took his own life
yesterday, having first perhaps mor
tally wounded May Barnum, a denizen
of the tenderloin.
The shooting occurred shortly after
1 o'clock at the Dunlap House, 220 A
Scetie of Attempted Murder and Suicide on O'Farfe 1 ! Street.
J'Farrel! street, in room 30, second
fl-r, back, where the unfortunate
woman had her apartments. No one
heard the shooting, and the first that
"was known of it was when the woman
rushed down into the office where Dun
lap was and exclaimed, "Bob has shot
me."
She would have fallen, but a waiter
who was passing caught her. The
"wrapper that she wore was on fire at
the waist from the weapon having been
placed against her body.
As soon as the proprietor of the house
Tealized what had happened he sent in
a call to the Receiving Hospital for the
ambulance, and then rushed out into
the street, where he called Sergeant
Coogan and Officer Hayden, who hap
pened to be passing at the time.
Â° They went at once to the woman's
rooms, where they found Briese lying
upon the floor dead, and by his side a
smoking revolver. ' The man lay upon
i. his back Just inside the portieres of
the bedroom. The bullet hole in his
left temple and the pool of clotted
blood on the floor told their own story.
The officers at once summoned the Cor
oner and the body was removed to the
Morgue.
The woman had occupied the apart
ments for about two months. They
consisted of a bedroom and a drawing;
room. There was a quiet, and gentle
taste about their furnishings.. In the
drawing room was a piano, pictures,
and many pretty ornaments, while the
bedroom was appointed with . much i
taste. In contrast to this the burned j
ends of cigarettes, beer glasses and
several bottles of whisky were mute
and silent testimony as to the life of
the woman.
None of the people living in the house i
could give any reliable or tangible tes- j
timony as to how the tragedy had oc- ,
Burred.' One woman said that Briese i
had been in earlier in the day trying to [
see May Barnum, but had not succeed
ed. No one. saw the man come in, and i
the first that was known of his being i
in. the house was when the woman
rushed down' into the office. .... .* -
Briese when the officers found: him
â wore a dark brown coat and vest, and
a pair of black pants. He had a gold
watch and. a diamond stud in his shirt, j
while fifty dollars in gold was upon his
person. . . - ...-, â '-_
The woman gave the following ac-
I count of the affair, and as to what were
fhs causes: . r â¢' :
"My name is May Barnum. -I am
23 years of age and was born in Ger
many. I came here eight years :â  ago
and five years since I met "and mar
ried Samuel E. Barnum, who is a car
penter. ,' He lives at 171 Perry street, j
The first year of our married "life 'was j
one of happiness, and this continued
\ until my little girl wus burn. That was
four yours ago. Then somehow things !
Beemed to go wrong, and I could not i
! keep straight, so I left my husband,
( and from that time I have only been
; a disgrace to him, and have been get
: ting lower and lower in the scale of
j morality.
j "I have known Bob for about a year.
IHe fascinated me and 1 promised to
; marry him, but I never intended to do
j so. and have been putting him oft from
I time to time. This is why he shut me,
| and now that I know he Is dead, I am !
i aware that a bad man is no more."
Here the woman stopped for breath.
To speak was evidently agony to her,
i for huge beads of perspiration stood j
j out upon her forehead and she tossed I
' from one Bide of the narrow cot to the
I other. Occasionally she would lay her
j hÃnds upon the place where she was
wounded and say: "I know that I am j
going to die. If I thought that T wns
, fninff to get well I would not tell you
: all this." Then she continued:
"Last night Bob came to my room i
about 3 o'clock and wanted me to let
him in. but I would not. He went
away and came back at 11 o'clock this
morning and again tried to get me to |
let him in, but I refused. About 1 i
o'clock I got up and ate my breakfast,
and when I had finished I put the tray
out in the hall and did not think to
lock my door.
"It was shortly after this that he
came again and walked into my room.
I was sitting down, putting on my
stockings, but when he entered I arose. !
I said, 'Hello, Bob,' and he replied: !
'What did yo-u do it for? I knew you j
were in hero when I first came; why
didn't you let me in?'
"With this he reached for his hip i
pocket and in a moment I divined his
intention! for his was a jealous nature,
and I cried, 'Don't Boh,' at the same j
time holding out my arms to protect !
myself. He drew hi? pistol and placing
it against my stomach fired. I fell to j
the floor. I then saw him place the ;
weapon to his head and pull the trig
ger. I jumped up and rushed from !
the room, and as I did so Bob sank
with a moan at the foot of my bed.
"He shot me because I would not
marry him. lie was in love with me
and jfp.lous of any attention that I re
ceived from others. I had no idea of
marrying him and I was U> leave
the runlap House. The last time I
paw my hvsband to speak to him wns
at New Yt.ar. He had heard where I
va? and came to see me. ,V<? have not
spoken since then. I deserve all that
has happened to me, but for the sake
of my hahy and my good husband I am
truly sorry."
The w- irar had scarcely Qniihe-3 her
pad recital, when her husband, who
had been sent for, entered. He ap
prcached her cot and for a moment
seemed t" hesitate as if uncertain cf
his reception. Then followed a silent
pantomime that was intense in its dra
ma; ie force. The woman simply
s'retched out her arms, whi'.a In t:e"
f-y*=s was a silent, pleading prayer for
forgiveness. The strong man bent
down and kissed her. There was no
wÂ«.rc! spoken, but in the simpl?. human
act, the past was obliterated and all
was forgotten. The woman smikd ir.
a happy and peaceful way as her hus
band sat beside her and held her hard.
He wanted to remove her to his home,
but the doctor would not permit it as
she was too weak.
Dr. Frank T. Fitzgibbon made an ex
amination of the woman when she was
first brought in. He found that the ball
had entered to the right of the navel
and passed through her body, coming
out to the right side of the spinal cord.
Dr. Fitzgibbo-n thinks that the intes
tines have been perforated and that an
operation may be necessary. He de
clares that the woman's condition is
f-ritical, and that the chances are
against her recovery. Her pulse is
very weak, and it is feared that sho
may have an internal hemorrhage at
any time.
While the woman was away in Stock
ton last week Briese visited her room
on several occasions, but, of course,
there was no reply to his requests for
admittance.
He undoubtedly intended to kill her,
for just before his murderous d<?ed he
went to his saloon at 211 Grant avenue
and took his pistol from behind the bar
and left without saying a word to the
barkeeper, who was on duty at the
time.

COMPANY D'S
ENTERTAINMENT
Animatoscope Pictures
Received With Great
Enthusiasm.
Frank Dougherty Wins a Gold
Medal for Efficiency in
Drill.
A Neat Sum Realized, Which Will Be
Used in Buying Uniforms
and Equipments.
The animatoscope exhibition given at
Odd Fellows' Hall last evening by Com
pany D of the League of the Cross,
for the purpose of depicting Compa
nies A, G, and D of that organization
on full parade, proved to be a success
far beyond the most sanguine expecta
tions of those directly interested in it.
The pictures thrown on the screen were
life-size and marvelously true to na
ture.
Company A headed the parade with
its commander and chief officers in full
regimentals, followed by a hundred or
more privates on a steady and uniform
march, with uplifted sabres, which
fairly glistened in the strong and pow
erful electric light from the rear of the
immense screen. Next in order came
Companies G and D, headed by their
respective commanders and principal
officers. As the* well-recognized fea
tures of the members of the different
companies appeared on the screen they
were loudly and enthusiastically ap
plauded by friends and relatives until
their disappearance on the farther side.
This exhibition proved to be the cen
tral feature of the entertainment and
the recollection of the first part of
the programme was nearly lost in the
interest manifested in this life-like pre
sentation of the cadets on parade. The
display, and in fact the entire enter
tainment, was given under the auspices
of Company D, and under the imme
diate direction of its officers.
In conjunction with the animato
scope a competitive drill was given for
a gold and silver medal, awarded as
trophies by the company to those ca
dets most efficient in military tactics
and the various commands, which a
thorough knowledge of the subject in
cludes.
In competing for the first trophy
none but non-commissioned officers
were eligible, while the second or silver
medal was restricted exclusively to
privates.
The gold medal was won by Frank
Dougherty of the non-commissioned of
ficers, while the silver medal passed
into the possession of Rudolph .Longer
bough.
The members of the company who
entered the contest were divided into
three squads of from ten to twelve
boys in each squad.
The programme, including the com
petitive drill and the animatoscope ex
hibition, was arranged under the di
rection of the boys of the Sacred Heart
Parish (Company D, of the League of
the Cross).
The proceeds are to be devoted to the
army and uniform fund of the com
pany.
EPWOBTH LEAGUE.
The California Conference of the Ep-
WDrth League will hold a convention at
I the Howard-Street Methodist Episcopal
Church, commencing Thursday, April 21,
and continuing through to the following
Sunday.
The committee on programme consists
of Rev, J. N Beard. R. V. Watt, Rev. A.
T. Needham, Oakland, and L. J. Norton
Napa. These gentlemen are arranging a
programme which will provide for all the
interests cf the leagues and will be one
of the most complete ever presented to a
convention. While at present names of
the speakers cannot be given it Is confi
dently expected that several of the most
prominent workers In the Etfst will be
present and take part in the proceeding?
Meetings will bo held morning, after
noon and evening, and' music will be made
a special feature of the conference. It is
being selected now and will be published
in a convenient form for the use of the
delegates, of which a large number are
expected from all over the State.
He Has Not Settled.
The attorneys for Mrs. Frankle "White,

Mendoclno County, denies the statement
that White has settled with her accord
ing to the order of the court which grant
ed her a divorce. He has made no set
tlement with her, she Bays, and she Is
now before the courts striving for her
legal rights. She also wishes It denied
that she is the niece of the cattleman.
IMPALED ON A SCANTLING.
An Apprentice on the Clan Galbraith
Dangerouslg Wounded.
A probably fatal accident happenM on the British ship Clan Galbraith
yesterday. Six or seven of the apprentice boys were engaged in painting the
hold of the vessel preparatory to her being laid up until next season. They
had to climb up a considerable distance In order to get to their work, and to
lighten their labor each of the ladu took up a piece of scantling with which
to make a seat. One of these pieces of scantling broke, and both it and the
apprentice boy who had been using it fell into the lower hold, thirteen or
fourteen feet below. Unfortunately the scantling stood on end as it reacted
the lower deck and the boy was lmpaU-d on it. He was taken to St. Mary's
Hospital, where he now hovers between life and death.
In talking about the accident yesterday Mate Nichols of the Clan Gal
braith said: "I had just finished warning the boys about their insecure
seats when Percy Hugo, the apprentice In question, fell at my feet. I im
mediately went to his assistance, and made him as comfortable as possible
on the planking-. I could see that hlÂ« trousers had been badly torn by the
scantling and asked him if he was much hurt. He put his hand on the wound
and drew it away covered with blood. I Immediately sent for Dr. McDon
ald, and in the meantime did everything possible for the lad. We stopped the
flow of blood in a measure, and when the doctor arrived he said the boy
would have to be taken to the hospital. He was got ready and sent to St.
Mary's Hospital in the ambulance. On his arrival there the wound broke
open again, and I believe that the surgeons found it very hard to control
the hemorrhages.
"There is very little chance for the ship to be chartered at this time of
the year, and the captain decided to lay her up at Martinez. Everything
was being cleaned up and the ship got ready to leave the wharf when the
accident happened. The boys had fastened pieces of scantling into the tim
bers that run along the side of the ship to sit on. These pieces of scantling
would stand up almost perpendicular and the boys would have to squeeze
between them and the side of the vessel in order to make it support them. I
had barely finished my warning when the scantling on which Hugo was
sitting broke, and the unfortunate boy was impaled on it almost at my
feet.
MYSTERIOUS
DEATH OF
AN ACTRESS
Ethel Burtis Died Un
der Strange Cir
cumstances.
Three Morphine Pills
Were Found Under
Her Pillow.
Dr. Martin Positive That He
Did Not Prescribe Morphia
for His Patient.
CORONER TO INVESTIGATE
Embalming or the Body May
Have Destroyed Poison
Traces.
A pitiable fatality, and one which
seems to demand investigation by the
Coroner, occurred at a rooming house
on Eddy street on Thursday evening.
Ethel Burtis, a variety actress, en
gaged a room at 43 Eddy street on
March last year. During July she was
taken sick and since then she has
never appeared to have regained her
usual health. On February 1 last she
was ill again, and Dr. Martin of the
Palace Hotel was called in attendance.
The doctor states that she was suffer
ing from capillary bronchitis, and when
she died he signed a certificate to that
effect. Circumstances have arisen,
however, which seem to point to the
fact that death was caused by mor
phine poisoning. Three morphine pills
were found In a box under her pillow
after her death, and those in attend
ance on the sick woman say the doc
tor prescribed them for her.
Dr. Martin strenuously denies that
he ever at any time prescribed for his
patient pills in which morphine figured
at all; and further he says he never at
any time called at Kelly's, d^ug store
on Eddy street foi pilis of that de
scription. The drug clerk at the drug
store asserts that the doctor called
there personally for the pills on Wed
nesday evening, and that he has the
prescription on file. k
People who are well acquainted with
the dead girl assert that she was not
addicted to the use of the drug, and
that she had been entirely witnout food
for nearly a fortnight. She was heard
to complain bitterly that she had no
one to attend to her at night, although
there was a girl in attendance on her
during the day. The girl's name is
Wise. In an Interview yesterday she
said:
"I have been In attendance on Ethel
Burtis for seven weeks during the day
time, but have never nursed her at
night. She has often begged me to
stay with her at night, but my father
will not permit me to be away from my
home after 8 p. m. The only time I
have ever seen her take morphine was
when Dr. Martin injected it into her
arm with a syringe. I have seen him
do this about half a dozen times. I
have been several times to Kelly's
drug store for pills, but they were not
morphine pills. She has not eaten any
thing for ten or twelve days. All her
relatives live in New York, and her sis
ter who was here with her has gone
back there. There was a gentleman
who came to see her who used to bring
pills for her, and tell her to take them

when he had gone. They were in a
small box, the same box which was un
der her pillow when she died."
The drug clerk at Kelly's drug store
asserts that it is impossible to obtain
morphine at his place of business with
out a physician's prescription, and that
the pills obtained by Dr. Martin con
tained one-quarter grain of sulphate of
morphia. The dead girl's name does
not appear on the prescription book,
and she is not known to have had any
means of procuring morphine except
from her physician.
The pitiable part of it is that her peo
ple in New York do not know that she
has been living a life of shame in this
city, her sister having kept the fact
from them. Her love for the stage led
to her ruin, and perhaps death. Her
body is now at McGinn's undertaking
parlors and will be buried to-morrow
morning at the Masonic cemetery.
The dead woman has been living with
Ned Foster for at least two years, and
he has always kept her fairly well sup
plied Avith money. On the evening of
her death Foster gave instructions to
McGinn Bros., the undertakers on Eddy
street, to embalm the body at once.
They carried out his orders immedi
ately, and all trace of the morphine
poisoning would be eliminated by the
action of the embalming fluid.
The matter has been brought to the
notice of the Coroner, and he intends
to investigate the case very thoroughly.
Divorce Suits Filed.
George Hendry filed suit yesterday for
divorce from his wife, Letltla Hendry, al
leging as a cause of action cruelty on the
part of the defendant. Frank Voltolini
seeks a divorce from his wife, Barbara,
on the ground of intemperance. Lettie B.
Chirm has commenced suit against
Thomas W. Chinr. for a divorce, on the
ground of desertion. Emma Konlg seeks
to have her marriage to Viggo Konig
annulled. The plaintiff alleges that her
husband refuses to provide her with the
necessaries of life.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET. '
NEW YORK, Feb. IS.â The tone of the
speculation was doubtful and hesitating In
Wall street to-day and the large preponderance
of the day's dealings was In Sugar and thÂ»
Grangers. Nearly 60 per cent of the total
transactions was In these stocks. Coupled
with the fact that the total sales of all stocks
showed a marked decrease In the recent aver
age the large proportion absorbed by these
specialties formed a significant commentary
upon the condition Into which the market has
fallen. After the opening weakness, due to
sympathy with the Ixmdon and some other
foreign exchanges harl been overcome, It look
ed an though the strength radiating from the
Grangers had prevailed in the market, but the
Increasing weakness of Sugar, coupled with a
fall In the prices of local New York special
ties in the final hour was a decisive factor In
driving prices below last night's level.
The radical utterances made In the course
of the debate precipitated in tno Senate on
the Maine disaster also ended in the distrust
in the minds of speculators and prompted li
quidation. Business on the decline was by far
the most animated of any during the day.
The Union Pacific. Denver and Gulf securi
ties were strong on rumors that the reorgan
ization In prospect would bear easily on th.-m.
The bond market held firm except that some
of the speculative issues yielded In the late
dealings. There were very heavy Individual

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Feb. 18.â was evident at the
| start In wheat trading that the short scare, so
prominent a feature of trading all week, had
nearly all died out under the Influence of .the
heavy dealing during . yesterday's session. In
addition the most Important of the early news
j was nearly all In, favor of bears and a weak
I and lower opening was the inevitable result.
May. of which the closing price yesterday wa>
$1 04*. was offered at from $1 03* down to
$1 03, and the price soon dropped to $1 02*. or
4y,c lower than the highest price paid yester
day. In this decline Argentine news was prom-,
inent. Argentine shipments for the week
i amounted to 1,288,000 bushels, against 712,000
j bushels the week previous and 152,000 bushels
last year.. Cable news was also rather ' dis
couraging to holders, both Liverpool And Paris
; showing small declines. The character of the
I news, however, soon changed. A Liverpool
Corn Trade News cable from Rosarlo, Argen
tine, said that continued heavy rains were
doing considerable damage and the market
was advancing with sellers scarce. This
caused a cessation of selling here and strated
a buying demand which soon sent the May
j price back to $1 03*. It reacted then to $1 02% c,
| but again advanced, getting to $1 03* shortly
after 11 o'clock. Toward midday the mar
ket became quite strong. New York ard Bos
â  ton reported the taking of freight room for 750.
; 000 bushels of wheat for export to Liverpool,
1 all of which was credited to Leiter. Several
i of the large sellers of yesterday, notably Cud
i ahy. bought quite freely. A general buvlni?
| movement was started by the â  Leiter freU-hc
i room engagements, May advancing to $1 04 and
July to SS%c. At the close May was bring
ing $1 03* and July *Â»%r. S
There was a large general trade in corn. The
i close was %c lower for May.

BRADSTREET'S FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW TORK. Feb. 18.â Bradstreet'8 Financial
Review to-morrow will say: Speculation waa
altogether dominated this week by unsettling
influences due to the disaster to the Maine at
Havana. At the beglning of the week there
was a decided disposition ln the market to re
cover from the depressing effects of the De
Lome lnoident, but this was, of course, com
pletely checked by the unexpected news which
awaited the street on Wednesday morning.
Fears that the explosion would not prove to be
an accident, and that the long threatened crisis
in our relations with Spain was at hand,
caused heavy liquidation of long stocks, and
the bear operators also sold the market vigor
ously, producing sharp though not excessive
declines throughout the list. On Thursday
London came wltb bigger prices for American
stocks, and was a liberal purchaser here, our
own market responding, although the absence
of definite news as to the cause of the Maine's
destruction gave an opportunity to sensation
mongers to circulate many disturbing and ex
aggerating stories. The market was affected
by this, and prices were very- irregular, al
though before the close on Thursday a fair
degree of Btrength reappeared, and the shorts
put ln the two preceding days were extensively
covered. The features of the market were
the extreme nervousness and the decreased
support from the pools and large operators,
though the extreme declines were ln many
cases arrested by buying for large Interests
which could not be described as short cover-
Ing.
The liquidation of long holdings was ex
tensive and public buying of course was al
most entirely checkedâ ln fact, conservative
commission houses as a rule, advised caution
and waiting until the situation regarding Spain
was clear. There were a number of Import
ant developments In the railroad situation, but
the market appeared to disregard them for the
time being.
BRADSTREBT'S REVIEW.
NEW TORK. Feb. 18.â Bradstreet's to-mor
row will say: Favorable features dominate the
general business situation as a whole and few
commercial conditions present themselves
which can be regarded as in any degree dis
turbing. Chief among those factors which
make for continued or growing strength In
commercial lines may be mentioned the re
newed tendency toward advances In quotations
of all staple articles and the steadiness of
prices In other lines where Increases are not at
the moment reportable. Perhaps second In tht
list of auspicious features is the continuance
of marked activity In nearly all branches ot
the Iron and ateel trade, more particularly in
the Central West, where It is authoritatively
reported over Â»0 per cent of the plglron furnace
rapacity is in blast. The failure of the South
ern furnace men to reach a price agreement
is of course a depressing feature In that sec
tion, which, however, finds a counter balancing
factor In the intention to advance prices re
ported from Bessemer ore producers. The vol
ume of distributive trade shows an Increase,
notably in dry goods and groceries, at so man>
widely separated points as to warrant tht
conclusion that spring trade Is receiving a per
ceptible Impetus. At the West iron and steel
mills are reported generally busily employed
und unv.-illlng to take orders for future deliv
ery. At Chicago 30,000 tons of steel rails ha\>
been sold in the last two weeks. The bicycle
trade is reported starting up well at the
West, but Is st... slow at the East, when.,
however, the cotton goods situation Is one of
hopeful strength, owing to the strength of raw
material and the Â» restriction of production duo'
to the New England mill strikes. As to the
strength of cotton, sugar and rice and the de
mand for Iron - all favor the â . Southern trade
situation, which Is also being helped by the
growing foreign * trade In cotton goods. The
activity in Alaskan shipments â¢ keeps vessels
busy on the Pacific Coast and freight rates art
firm. California crop prospects are not en
couraging, as a whole. :. '
Business failures continue to decrease, aggre
gating only 269 for â  the week, against 273 las*
week, .325 In the corresponding week of 1897.
276 In 1896, 327 in 1895 and 233 in 1894. â¢ ,
â  As above Intimated the price situation Is one
of local strength. Compared with a week ago,
not one article of staple use is reported lower,
although some low grades of wool would have
to be shaded if sales were made. This was ow
ing to the absence of manufacturers from the
market during the past few weeks. -; Prices of
nearly all kinds of grain, but notably wheat,
corn and flour and of most metals, and par
ticularly steel billets, copper, lead and tin,
have advanced. The agreement by the, Bess
emer ore producers will nrobably result in an
advance on the coming seasons output.
- Cereal exports tend to increase. Exports of
Jâ¢,." 1 our Included) for the week aggregate
3..'32,744 bushels, as against 3,419,000 bushels
â a? 1 . f e Â£ : 2.120,000 bushels last year. 3.149,
â¢ I s ,? Is ln 1896 and 1 SOS.OOO bushels in 1895.
me bulk of this increase over last week Is
chargeable to large flour exports. .
DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK. Feb. IS.-R. O. Dun & Co.'s
Review of Trade: The dreadful disaster to the
Malno, much as it has affected all hearts, has
not much affected business. Only In the stock
market, where there was selling Wednesday by
speculators on thin margins, but in no other
speculative market was an effect felt, nor in
general business. An advance of 10 per cent
in wages by some Gogebic mines 1Â« expected
to be general throughout the lake region, ex
cepting the Mesaba District, and prices of ore
from the other ranges this year have been ad
vanced 16 per cent, with an allotment of 6,000,
000 tons outside Carnegie's mines, which be
tokens an output much the largest ever known.
Wheat has risen 3% points and exports con
tinue so heavy that a material advance is nat
ural. Atlantic exports in three weeks have
?*?," S.Â«6.fei9 bushels, tlour Included, against
6,6 M,9.l last year, and Pacific export* have been
2,4ib,t>02, against 1,474. 75 i last year. Such ship
ments, with heavy engagements for the future,
in spite of 11,430.831 bushels of corn exported,
against 12,507,214 bushels In the same week last
year, are conclusive proof of the urgency of
foreign needs. Wheat receipts hold up well,
though not exceeding last year's as much as
exports In three weeks, 7,776,560 bushels against
4.554.740 last year.
The bottom fact is that the world needs
wheat, which this country can only supply for
about six months to come.
The Iron output February 1, with reports of
stocks on hand not held by the great steel
companies, indicates a consumption of at least
3000 tons per week greater in January than the
previous maximum attained In November, 1597.
The production Is at present greater than the
consumption, stocks having increased 9016 tons
weekly in January, outside of the steel com
panies, whose stocks presumably decreased.
Pome weakness in pig would naturally result,
but while gray forge has declined at Pittsburg
to $S 90, with Southern iron offered at Chicago
at concessions, no change appears in products.
Though new business has beer, somewhat dis
appointing: the works are mainly supplied for
months ahead.
In building of steel cars. In black sheets for
tinning, in rods, wire and wire nails Increased
demand and heavy business appear, though
bar and pipe are weaker and structural orders
seasonably slow. Mine metals have advanced,
tin to 14.20 con considerable consuming de
mand, copper to 11.14 c for lake on heavy ex
ports and lead to 3.SOc and Fpelter to 4.10 con
speculation, but failure to organize the tin
pool caused weakness. American selling at 3c
and lower at the West.
Failures for the week hnve been 29ft In the
United States, against 303 last year, and 35 In
Canada, against 58 last year.

COALâ Harrison's circular says: "During
the week four vessels arrived from Washington
with 11.600 tons of coal; three from British
Columbia, 7441 tons; two from Oregon. 755 tons;
one from Newcastle, 1030 tons; total. 20.286
tons. Since the call for domestic coals has
eased off, there Is no further excitement to
chronicle In the fuel market; there are no
changes in values, and probably will not be.
unless owners of coal carriers should further
advance their freight rates, which advance will
of necessity be added to the coal. There Is al
ways a regiment of 'alarmists' In a commu
nity, who "are ever prepared to predict fam
ines and short supplies of leading articles of
commerce, but there is no valid reason for
predicting a fuel famine In IS9S. Higher prices
will open other avenues for supplies, which
are temporarily out of the market, and our
principal producers would be most Imprudent
to permit Imports from these sources, by rais
ing the scale of values.
"Our continuous dry weather Is making It
self felt, by causing considerable advances on
coal freights from Australia and Great Britain.
"During the week there has been an Increase
of full*, one shilling per ton: the last quoted
cabled rates, name 17a from Swansea and Car
diff. and 16s 6d from Newcastle, N.S.W., which
means 15s from Sydney. Free engagements
have been made at the advanced rates."'

bush. The withdrawal of Mr. Fibush
from official life just at this time, when
the water rate ordinance is pending,
has caused much comment, as it is gen
erally thought that he should have re
mained another week until a final vote
is taken an the water ordinance. Mr.
Fibush says his business takes all his
time and he does not care to stay
longer in public life.
The appointment of Major "Woodward
is a disappointment to those who are
anxious to juggle with the water rates
so that the ordinance so kindly pre
pared by the Ccrntra Costa Company
can be squeezed through the Council. ,
Major Woodward at once declared him- i
self, for while he would not answer a ;
direct question regarding the water
rates, which he has had no opportunity
yet of studying, he stated very posi
tively that he will be found on the side
of the pecrple.
This means that Major Woodward
may either decline to vote or will vote
against it. In either case, his vote will
be lost to the water companies, for \
should he join. Messrs. Cuvelier, Upton,
Rowe Girard, Brosnahan and Pringle
the vote for the people's ordinance
would be 7to 4. Should the new Coun
cilman decline to vote, not having
taken part in the previous discussions,
the vote will be 6 to 4. Ever since the
six Councllmen have gone on record,
considerable influence has been brought
to bear cm some of them to cause them
to fall down, but they all declare they
will stand by their constituents. Major
Woodward has been for many years a |
real estate dealer and an active mem
ber of Lyon Post, G. A. R. He has
had a long experience in Oakland, and
should make a practical Councilman.

A Philosopher's Answer
to a Much Mooted
Question.
Pluralism Declared to Give
Life the Highest Possible

D. Bakewel 1 of Berkeley Believe'
That Immortality Makes Life
Worth Living.
BERKELEY, Feb. 18.â Dr. C. M.
Bakewell in an address before the Phil
osophical Union this evening on the
subject, "Is Life Worth Living?" de
clared that in spite of all appearartres
life is supremely worth living. The
meeting this evening was the seventy
seventh regular meeting of the union
and the first meeting in the Philosophy
building. Dr. Bakewell's paper was
in the nature of a criticism upon an
essay by Professor William James in
his book on "The Will to Believe,"
which the union is at present discuss
ing. In his criticism Dr. Bakewell
said:
I cannot help feeling that Professor
James' paper, bright and entertaining as it
is, has only brought the question which
It professes to discuss into greater con
fusion, and that largely because he does
not in his discussion separate two widely
different questions: (1) By what persua
sion can one dissuade a would-be suicide
from taking his life? (2) By what argu
ment can one convince a philosophical
pessimist that life is worth living?
The faith cure of pessimism may have
some effect in dissuading the would-be
: suicide from taking his own life, but it
cannot road the difficulty of the philo
, sophical pessimist, which is purely a the
oretical difficulty. For him the true ques
tion as to the worth of life resolves itself
Into the question as to the worth of man.
What he wants to know is: "Is life really
worth living?" or what is the same thing:
"Is he really a being of infinite and eter

The reflective student can only void life
to be worth living if he can find good, ;
solid grounds for believing that his icieais
are not vain desires, and his struggles,
which may seem futile, are bearing .ruit; ;
that there is an order in which virtue is
not trampled under foot and- vice does
not triumph; that it is only in the par

that the problem means this is easily

A Question of Law.
OAKLAND, Feb. 18.-The question of
the validity of the recent annexation is
now under examination in the Superior
Court, before Judge Hall. The suit is at
issue on stipulation, and the only matters
which are under discussion are the fail
ure of the City Council to act upon the
original petition, the incorporation into a
municipality of incorporated sanitary dis
tricts and parts of the same, and the
authority to enlarge any waru of the city
prior to 1900 by the City Council. But
little testimony was introduced, as it is
almost wholly a question of law. The
arguments began this afternoon, and will
continue to-morrow.

A GOOD SHOWING.
Chief Lloyd's Report â No Use to
Repair the Old Prison.
OAKLAND, Feb. 13.â Chief of Police
Lloyd filed his annual report to-day with
the Police Commissioners. It shows a
very satisfactory and economical admin
istration.
Regarding the condemned City Prison,
the Chief says:
"In conclusion, I wish to call the atten
tion of your honorable body to the un
healthy condition of the City Prison. Im
mediate steps should be taken, as recom
mended by the Mayor to correct and re
form existing conditions, and while I am
of the opinion that it will not be economy
to attempt to make repairs in the present
City Prison, because of its location, and
the improbability of the erection of a hos
pital annex, which is very necessary In
the light of the attitude of those in charge
of the Receiving Hospital, still, any re
lief would be moat welcome."

Want a "Spectacular Bourdon."
BERKELEY, Feb. 18.â The freshmen at
the university decided this morning to
have a "Spectacular Bourdon Celebra
tion" this year instead of a "rushing
Bourdon," such as has been held for
many years on the college campus. The
change was made on account of the edict
of the faculty forbidding rushing. The
class of 1901 has invited the other classes
to join with it in making the spectacle a
success. A number of the sophomores
have repeatedly declared that if the
freshmen attempted to have a Bourdon
burial the sophomores would rush them.
There is considerable speculation as to
just what will be the outcome of the mat
ter.

WORKING TO SAVE BROTHER AND LOVER.
Ina Wllmore, the girl lover of Ab*e Majors and the sister of Bert "Wil
more, the romantic boy burglars. Is working to obtain a pardon for the lad,
who is now serving a ten-year sentence in Folsom.
Yesterday afternoon Ina and Colonel Dimpfel were in the County
Clerk's office looking over the papers, so that there should be no mistake
as to the various steps to be taken in seeking the clemency which the
young girl so ardently desires.
Ina Wilmore is now 16 years old and is a bright-eyed, intelligent girl.
She is at present working as a nurseglrl, and everybody speaks very highly
of her. The last two years of her life have made a woman of her, and
taught her self-reliance. At the time of the trial every effort was made to
show that her mother and also that she knew of the long list of thefts and
burglaries committed by her brother and Abe Majors, but although Mrs.
"Wilmore was detained in jail and examined in the Police Court it could not
be proved that she knew anything of the lads' career of crime. The bitter
experience since her brother was arrested and sentenced has made Ina
thoughtful and philosophical beyond her years. As she sat at the table in
the County Clerk's office looking through the record of arrest, confession
and sentence her large blue eyes filled with tears as she thought of her
brother and his companion, who had been so generous to her two years ago.
But' as soon as the somewhat bluff yet kind-hearted colonel spoke the girl
quickly changed her expression and suddenly became as practical as an at
torney.
Now that the excitement of those days when burglaries were rife and
mysterious has passed away there is not so much condemnation but con
siderable sympathy for the two lads. That their career was wicked and
daring no one doubts, but it was more romantic than either, and the friends
of the boys now believe that a lean sentence than ten yearn would fit the
case. Ina Is confident th&t she can secure their releaoe before long, as both
lads are said to be well behaved and to have realised thoroughly the enor
mity of their crimes, which they certainly did not at the time they were tak
ing the role of outlaws. The bay burglars have not yet served quite two
years of their sentence.

THE SELLING
PLATERS' DAY
Four of Six Well-Played
Choices Beaten at
Emeryville.
Conley's Whirlwind Finish Got
Peter the Second Home
First.
Montallade Won at Good Odds Â«nd
Was Bid Upâ Semicolon First
in the Two- Year-Old Dash.
The selling platers held a levee at
Emeryville track yesterday, five of the
six events on the card being condition
ed for the cheaper class of horses. Some
very exciting finishes were witnessed
during the afternoon, and the favorites
figured conspicuously in but two of
them. By Holly's handy sprinter was
the longest priced winner, capturing
the last race at odds of 1 to 1.
The opening event at seven furlongs
with a field of twelve going to the post |
was a most open betting affair, there
being 4 and 5 to 1 chalked against half j
a dozen of the entries, finally ending
with Koenigen closing a slight favor- j
Ite. The latter led to within a few yards I
of the wire, when McNichols brought
Sea Spray up and won easily from ;
Chappie, a 12 to 1 outsider. The favor- j
ite was third.
There -were a number of bad actors j
among the starters in the six and a ;
half furlong run, and the straggling
Start practically gave the race to the j
favorite, Amelia Fonso. She led all
the way. and at the wire yon easily \
from Peixotto, a 4 to 1 chance, with
Clayton in the saddle. In a drive :
Schnitz secured the show from Ma- .
hogany.
The four-furlong dash for two-year
olds was gathered in by the Exile colt !
Semicolon, second choice in the betting, j
The wise ones played Clarando down ;
from 2 to 1 to 6 to 5. The latter was |
away from the post first, but Clawson ;
let him fall out of it, and the best the â 
youngster could do was to finish third.
After stalling off a bold challenge of j
San Augustine the second choice won j
by a length in :49%.
Through a superb piece of riding Con- '<
ley took the mile and a sixteenth sell-
Ing event with Peter the Second, second
choice in the betting. After Veragua
and George Palmer had led the big
field to the stretch, Conley brought his
mount up. and in a furious drive led I
Outgo over the line less than a length
In 1:49%. Veragua secured show hon
ors.
chihuahua scored his second set of
winning brackets in the five and a half
furlong purse run. Closing equal fa
vorite in the betting with Abini, he
was given a hard tussle by Ping, and
not until within a few yards of the
wire did he get up to the outsider in
time to win by the shortest of heads.
The pace proved too fast for Abina,
Dr. Rowell's mare being led out for
the place by the consistent Moringa.
The Burns & Waterhouse entry. Par
themax, opened a 5 to 2 favorite for the
seven furlong selling run which con
cluded the racing.but the stable appa
rently did not fancy his chances to any
great extent and the odds drifted back
to 4 to 1. Refugee went out in front
with a great showing of speed, head
ing the field to the stretch, where ho
had enough. Mainstay then assumed |

THORNTON STAKE TO-DAY.
An Immense Crowd Promises
to Be Present to Witness the
Big Four Mile Event.
The great four-mile Thornton Stake is down
for decision to-day. In the past It has been
won by Gllead. Star Ruby and Schiller. The
field to-day, while possibly not possessing as
much class as In former years, is a very evenly
matched one. and the result is purely prob
lematical. The veteran Thorpe will pilot Judge
Danny. Ed Corrirnns entry. The Bachelor,
will l>e guided by Willie Martin, and the llght
weighu-d Marplot by little Woods. "I*mÂ»
shot" Conley will throw the leg over Garland
Barr, while Wawona will probably have Claw
son in the saddle. Judge Penny in his races
has never shown any especial fondness for
weipht. but If there is no pace may fool the
wise ones. The rr.ee has always attracted an
immense crowd, and no doubt to-day's contest
will prove no exception.
M. A. Gunst apparently thought By Holly
had his sprinter Montallade entered to be sold
at too low a valuation in the last race, for
after he had won and was put up to be sold
the Police Commissioner bid him up from $200
to $70). By retained the gelding with the cus-
tomary $:> bid.
The old patched-up cripple Roche, one of the
well-played ones in the final race of the day,
broke down badly, and his turf career is prob
ably over for good. He was running very
easily in third position when one of his fore
legs gave out on him. and it was with difficulty
that he hobbled off the track.
The sale of Burns & Waterhouse's horses
takes place at the track to-day at 12 m. Cas
par, Alma. Osrlc, Burmah and other good per
formers will pass under the hammer. The sale
will be conducted by Klllip ft Co.
R. Clawson. father of the well-known Jockey,
and Atkin & Lottridge, the boy's employers,
are at loggerheads. It is said Clawson the
elder will seek to annul the contract existing
between his son and the well-known racing
firm.
Dorsey furnished a listless sort of a ride on
Sutton yesterday, and if the chestnut horse
is a starter in the second event to-day he
r.iiKht make a better showing.
M"i-;nga has a better record than Pecksniff
for finishing In the show without capturing a
purse. He has been seventeen times third and
twice second.

in the city at the Palnee. Mr. Purcell
has, unfortunately, not been on very good
terms with his wife's mother for several
years, though the relations between him
self and the partner of his joys and sor
rows are as pleasant as they were in the
roseate prenuptial days when they were
sweetheart and beau instead of man and
wife: at least, they were until a short
time ago, when the domestic harmony of
the Purcells was somewhat discorded by
the following lamentable mistake on the
part of Mr. Purcell:
He went down to Los Angeles on a
business trip lasting some six or eiftht
days without notifying his wife of his
whereabouts, and retained his room at
the Palace during his absence. He got
back last Sunday, and, as he had some
convivial spirits on his trip up. his con
dition, when he entered the hotel, was a
little bit confused. Just as he had fin
ished registering the clerk handed him a
telegram, which he opened at once, and
read therein'the following message:
"Oilyâ Mamma left me at 3 o'clock this
morning. KATE."
Purcell gazed at the message for a mo
ment in blank astonishment; then, rush
ing over to the telegraph office, sent this
reply:
"Kateâ What the devil was the matter
with thevold woman to make her do a
thing like that? Was she crazy?
"OLLY."
Then he went up to his room, where he
found a bundle of letters and telegrams
that had arrived during his absence, ac
quainting him with the sudden and
dangerous Illness of his mother-in-law
and the fears that were entertained that
it would prove fatal.
Mr. Purcell has been keeping the wires
hot ever since trying to square himself,
but so far not a word of reply has he re
ceived. This complete silence is consid
ered, by matrimonial experts, as a very
bad sign for the unfortunate Purcell.
F. T. Lynch and wife are among the ar

he lacked in cleverness he made up In

his opponent becoming worn out, the tide
of battle turned in his favor, and, grin
ning through his swollen lips, he started
to square things for the beating he had
received. The other fellow, however, saw
that things were about to go against
him, and, backing off a pace or two, held
up his hands and cried " 'nough."
" 'Nough,' echoed his enemy, "dis is 'er

THE STORY OF
HIS OWN DEATH
J. J. Livernash Kills Himself After
Having Written an Account
of His Suicide.
Deserted by Friends, and
Disgrace Was Soon to
Have Been His
Portion.
Led Into Betrayal of Trust by
a Passion for Poolroom
Gambling.
UNIQUE AMONG TRAGEDIES
The Man Even Supplied His Own
Picture so That the Narrative
Might Bo Complete.
Last night J. J. Livernash a
bullet through his heart.
Xo individual tragedy more grim ever
startled a city, nor appeared outside of
fiction. Livernash not only planned the
suicide deliberately, but he wrote the
account of it, explaining his reasons,
his methods, his hopes for the future
beyond the grave, his despair of life as
he had known it. He confessed to
faults. He accused others.
Last evening a tall young man
smooth shaved, his features expressing
intelligence, his voice indicative of
culture, came to the office of The Call.
He had a story to sell. The nature of
it he did not explain, but he was anx
ious to dispose of it, and stipulated that
the price should be paid to Mrs. J. J.
Livernash. He asserted that the story
would be of public interest, and it was
taken on faith, to be used if of suf
ficient value. To-day the story is used.
Before the packet containing manu
script and picture had been opened the
young man was dead by his own hand.
TVhen this grewsome climax to what
had been considered only an episode
Bomewhat out of the common was an
nounced the packet became invested
with a veird, uncanny fascination. It
was as a message thrust from the
tomb to humanity by a skeleton hand.
To the last, professional habit was
strong with Livernash. He had been
a newspaper man, and in preparing to
write the account of his suicide he
sought to include every detail. He be
gan with an introduction such as a re
porter might have written, this lead
ing up to a touching letter of farewell.
Then he added comments upon the
letter, and the affair. Later, he ap
pended a final note showing how his
plans had in a measure gone wrong.
Throughout, the language was cohe
rent, and there was hardly a trace of
excitement beyond that manifest in
the use of a few exclamation points.
Calmly he stood at the borders of eter
nity, chatting with friends, lending
pome stranger applicant his last dol
lar, listening to music at the saloons,
and paying no heed to protests that he
was not saving even a nickel for car
fare. He knew he would need no car
fare; that his night's rest would be at
the Mnrgup.
B. F. Allen was an Intimate friend of
Livernash's. Unconsciously he aided
in promoting the suicidal scheme. It
was his pistol Livernash used, and Al
len supplied him with cartridges. It
was he who was about the streets with
Livernash last evening, who went with
him to newspaper offices, who was
standing near when Jhe shot was fired,
and reached the side of 'the dying man
in time to hear his last word.
"John, did you do it?" Allen asked
as he tore away the clothing that
smoldered above the wound.
"Yes, Ben, I have done It."
And so Livernash gave his story a
value, and passed away.
Allen said that Llvemash and him
self left the place where they lived, 60
South Park, early in the evening. Liv
ernash told him he would have a story
for which he thought the Examiner
would pay $250. and for delivering this
Allen was to have $100. which would
"put him on his feet."
Livernash did not find Lawrence
readily, and when he did, was not satis
fled with the terms. It was then he
visited The Call, in the meantime hav
ing added something to the letter he
had prepared between his two visits
to the Mission street concern.
Allen made his statement freely.
"Livernash told me," he said, "that
he would have to go to Chinatown to
get this story. It was about a wharf
inger who was $3000 short In his ac
counts and was likely to skip out. Per
haps there would be trouble, and he
wanted to know where my pistol was.
"My pistol was in pawn at a place
on Third street for 50 cents. He gave
me 51 50 to get it, and I got it for six

bits, giving the other six bits back to
Livernash. He was to write the story
and leave it at a saloon at Kearny and
Merchant, and did so. There I was to
get and deliver it.
"1 had no idea Livernash was going
to kil' himself. As we walked around
he was perfectly natural. He lent his
last dollar and even ordered a beer he
c*>u'dn't pay for. I tried to get him
home, but he wanted to stop every
where."
The Letter From the Dead.
J. J. Livernash, at present State Collector at Beale and Fremont
street wharves, formerly editor of the Healdsburg Enterprise and
who recently established the California Forester in this city, com
mitted suicide in a saloon at 628 Mission street Friday night, in a
most deliberate fashion.
To prove this statement it is only necessary to publish his letter,
furnished exclusively to The Call and written by him only a few
moments before he pulled the trigger of a 38-caliber revolver that
sent his life a glimmering and brought sorrow to a loving wife and
devoted brothers and sisters. Here is his last epistle:
First of all, I do not -wish to be classed among the Insane who shuffle off
this mortal coll. I am not insane; but It seems to me that some evil genie
hovers over every movement of mine and that I am destined to be the
"under dog" all the time. I realize that kindly nature endowed me with more
than ordinary ability, that I had good training, that my father and mother
have gone before me to a better world, where I hope to meet them. Never
theless, troubles thicken around me. I have battled against misfortune. I
have ever tried to meet my obligations, and yet I find myself getting
deeper and deeper Into debt. It is only a question of time when the end of
all of it must come: When true friends, tiring of continually backing me,
must withdraw their support and leave me to battle for myself. This Is
near at hand. This very day I found It difficult to raise $12 among all my
city friends, when it would require $100 to balance my accounts with the
State. Thus it is I find myself confronted with disgrace, and I prefer the
end I am choosing to the other.
I sincerely hope that no one will charge me with insanity. I know full
well what I am doing, and prefer this end to facing what must soon come
to me.
I want my wife and sister to take charge of my remains and see that
they are laid to rest In the Cloverdale Cemetery, under the auspices of
Friendship Lodge No. 91, K. of P. I want my body to be placed in the
plainest sort of a coffin and desire no flowers. Let W. F. O'Leary, C. A.
Mobley, Eli Bush, James R. Miller, J. W. Hotchkiss and A. B. Provines act
as pallbearers, and request for me that Menihan and his family remain
from the cemetery. Let Mr. Menihan draw consolation from my untimely
end, remembering that he forced me to it. I chose the pallbearers I have
named because they have been friends to me through thick and thin, and
will remember me with kindly feelings. I request Menihan and his family
to remain from my funeral because at the very hour when friendship and
support from him would have done me good it was withdrawn.
I want my obligations to the State met at 100 cents on the dollar. A
$40 check in the safe at Hartman Bros., corner Second and South Park, In
guarantee for $30 I owe them. Let it be redeemed. The tolls I owe the
State are in my uniform coat pocket. I only ask one favor, and that is
a dying man's request. Will Governor Budd appoint to my position W. F.
Leary of Healdsburg, a sterling Democrat, and a man who will reflect credit
on his appointee. Do this for me, Governor, and you will never regret it.
In conclusion, I will say that I dislike to Quit this world. I have a
loving, true and noble wife â a dear little woman who has brought sunshine
to my life. Let her forget me as soon as she can. and when some worthy
man again selects her for a helpmate, I hope she may choose him. It is
I who have brought shadows to her happy life, and it is one of the sorrows
that is bearing down upon me. God bless her, and as she looks on my dead
face, may she say, "He never caused me pain in life."
And to my dear sister Lizzie. She is bright. She knows my fallings.
One day I told her I would kill myself, and she said: "John, If you do, do
not disfigure yourself, for you know you are homely enough now." I would
not give her unnecessary pain, and so, instead of blowing my head off, I
will feel around until I find where my heart throbs, place the pistol there
and pull the trigger. lam going out now to get a shave, and hope in
death my features will be at repose. And now, good-by. Let my relatives
pay my honest debts; let my enemies gloat over my silent clay; let my
brothers grow up to be worthy men, and my sisters virtuous women.
Good-by, Wharfinger Tom Deasey! You have been my good friend!
Good-by, Fox, I respect you! God bless my wife and family, and may they
find happiness in a land where misery has been mine.
This closed a remarkable document written by a man on the verge
of despair. He placed the pistol over his heart, drew the trigger and
death followed instantly.
Later â Realizing the necessity of realizing funds for my family I
went to see "Long Green Lawrence." I knew he would pay the top
price for blood money. Ido not hesitate to say that he would murder
a man if the emolument would warrant it. He was out. I was grow
ing desperate. My wife expected me in at 9. I must hurry, so I
went to The Call. I have sold a story to vhe Call for $100. To my
dying breath I swear they do not know what is in it. I also swear
that my brother, Ed, who is bogus, was sent to Alaska to escape a
summons in the 01&UB Spreckels' libel suit. Postpone action until he
comes, and remember, he and his wife broke the family and drove me
to this end. He It was who libeled Glaus Spreckels, and may him and
bis convent wife be brought to justice.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1898.
The man who had resolved to die
dreaded to approach the chosen Bpot of
death.
"He went into the saloon at 625 Mis
sion; I stayed at the door. A minute
later I heard the shot, and the proprie
tor, rushing out, asked me if that was
my friend. I went in and found him.
In a second or two he was dead.
"Livernash was getting $100 a
month. That would be a fortune to
me. yet I have a wife and three chil-
dren, while he had only a wife. But
he would spend money recklessly. He
played poker out at South Park and
Vine, and always lost. He would bluff.
I never knew him to quit winner. He
would bet on races, or anything else,
and was unlucky. Besides this he
drank too much. It was hard for him
to get past a saloon."
There is another little tragedy close
ly related to the taking off of Liver
nash. Out at the house of the widow

it is stated that only a few days ago
Allen attempted to commit suicide with
the same pistol, but was restrained,
and later pawned the weapon to secure
bread for his little ones.
Upon the body nf the suicide was
found the following letter, it harmon
izing with a point made in the letter
sold under seal to The Call.
W. F. O'Leary. Healdsburg. Friend
Billy: I have killed myself. You acted
very strange at Healdsburg Wednesday
night, and if you have left me every
friend is gone. Be my pall bearer. I hope
you will get my place, and if Budd re
spects the dying request of a Democrat
who has burned up good money in the
cause he will give It to you. JOHN.

to the sum of $3000, as he never had
control of any such amount.
HIS ACTIONS
SEEMED STRANGE
A pitiful scene occurred in the little
parlor of the dead man's ' residence
'when the news of his death was broken
to his wife last night. ? That \ bad news
of some kind ; was ; not unexpected was
easily seen by the troubled faces of his
wife and sister. Miss Lizzie Livernash,
when they were seen by a Call reporter.
The first words uttered by Mrs. Liver
naih,were;. "Is my husband in prison?"
and I the sister echoed ; ; her words. . Ab
soon as ; the two i afflicted .'', women 'â  had
somewhat recovered from the shook of

circumstances which â  drove the desper

to-night with a very strange look on
his face, and I asked him if he was
in any trouble. He assured me he was
not worried, and I thought perhaps he
had another despondent fit on him,
as he has been suffering so much late
ly in that way. He did not eat any
supper, nor did he read the evening
paper, as was his habit. He sat brood
ing for some time, and then asked me
for one of his own photographs, as he
had promised to give one to a repre
sentative of The Call. He put the pic
ture in his pocket and then told me
he was going to Chinatown to get a
story he was going to write for a pa
per. He then kissed me good night
and told me not to wait up for him, as
he was likely to be late. I thought
he was short in his accounts, as he had
been so terribly worried lately about
something, and I could not & t him to
confide in me. He has been playing
the races lately and gambling generally
in the pool rooms, but has always been
unlucky. I had no thought that he
would ever take his own life."
Miss Lizzie Livernash had thought
her brother's fits of despondency were
caused from the fact that he was short
in his accounts, and last Monday she
called upon Wharfinger Deasy to ask
him if her brother had been guilty of
misappropriation, offering to make
good any sum he might be short. When
seen last night, Miss Livernash said:
"My brother has been very despond
ent for two or three months, and I had
a suspicion that he was short in his
accounts. Last Monday I went to Mr.
Deasy and asked him if my brother was
short in his accounts. He assured me
everything was in order, and I felt
somewhat relieved. I knew he had
been playing the races and gambling
in the poolrooms, and that he was al
ways unlucky. He must have taken
the money hoping to- win and so pay it
back. I could easily have raised the

money for him if he would only have
confided his trouble to me. He always
assured me his accounts were in perfect
order and that he had never thought
of taking any money that did not be
long to him. He has been under the
best doctors in San Francisco for three
years, but lately he has been very ill,
and has had severe fainting fits, as
many as eight or ten in one night.
"He changed his clothes before h^
went out to-night and kissed me good
by. I thought his conduct strange, and
remarked to his wife that I thought he
intended to do something desperate.
He must have shot himself with Mr.
Allen's pistol, as Allen took cartridges
out with him, and they both went out
together. Allen himself tried to com
mit suicide last Friday, and it was my
brother who seized his gun before he
could accomplish his design. Mrs. Al
len came in and told us my brother was
acting in a very strange manner while
he was waiting for Allen to obtain the
cartridges. I never had the least
thought that my brother would take
his own life over an affair of this sort,
as we have many friends who would
have helped him out of his difficulty. I
do not know what we shall do now,
for we are a very big family, and my
father and mother are dead, and my
brother is thousands of miles away." .
Both wife and sister are sadly strick
en and there seems but little hope that
they will quickly recover, as they are
both in very feeble health.

ECLIPSE EXPEDITION A SUCCESS
Director Schaeberle Confirms It and
Writes a Letter of Thanks.
Through the generosity of the late
Charles F. Crocker, the eclipse expedi
tion to India of a number of local
scientists was made possible, and word
was received a short time ago that they
were successful in their undertaking.
The following letter from the Lick
Observatory confirms the interesting
news :
*"To the Relatives of the Late Hon.
Charles F. Crockerâ Gentlemen and La
dies: It gives me great pleasure to in
form you that the Lick Observatory
eclipse expedition to India, made possi
ble through the noble generosity of the
late Hon. Charles F. Crocker, is a com
plete success, according to a cablegram
received from Professor Campbell.
"Inseparably connected with the his
tory of the Lick Qfcservatory and as
tronomical science of the nineteenth
century will be the name of that gener
ous benefactor, already so well known
in the scientific world, whom we mourn
for to-day. Sincerely yours,
"J. M. Schaeberle,
"Acting Director."
For a time It looked as if the pro
jected trip would have to be abandoned
as the necessary funds were unavail
able. It was then that Colonel Crocker,
who was an enthusiast In astronomy,
was appealed to, and he came to the
rescue. Shortly after the expedition
started, Colonel Crocker died.
The Probate Court, after a proper
showing of the existing agreement be
tween the rajlrcad magnate and the
scientists, ordered the money paid.
