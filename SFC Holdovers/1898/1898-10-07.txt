WALKER. Minn.. Oct. 16.â There was more fighting on
the mainland near Bear Island to-day, and several more
brave men were killed and wounded by the savage Pilla
gers. Major M. C. Wilkinson, six privates and one Indian
policeman are dead: Captain Sheehan is slightly wounded
and a dozen other men have been hit. Several Indians are
dead. Kay-Bay-Gway-Tyh, chief of the Indian police, was
killed-
This is the substance of a report ]
brought by Sheehan, who came here on ;
a small steamer. It was impossible to
bring the wounded to town, for the In
dians kept up a constant flre on the
boat. The names of the killed and
wounded privates have not been ob
tained. Captain Sheehan says that the
Pillagers do not number more than 100. j
but they fight as only demoniacal sava- I
ges can. Unless overpowered by su- j
perior numbers not one of them will j
quit fighting. They are holding out now j
with a hope that the Cass Lake In- j
dians will join them. If they should ;
arrive before the troops are reinforced j

arrive. It will take several hours for
them to reach Sugar Point: therefore

BACON IN DESPERATE STRAITS.
WALKER, Minn.. Oct. 6.â So-unds of
! conflict have come from Bear Island all
day. but people here are still ignorant
of the real situation on the battle
ground where General Bacon and his
men had their desperate encounter
with* the Pillager Indians yesterday.
Up to an early hour this morning
there were many grounds for fearing
that General Bacon and his command
had been annihilated. No direct word
had been received from any man who
participated In the first battle.
Early this morning, however, the fir
ing was resumed and it has continued
practically all day.
This makes it certain that General
Bacon's command is still on earth and
in fighting trim. It is now believed the
soldiers are entrenched and in a parti
tion to hold out until reinforcements
reach them.
Lieutenant Colonel Harbach of the
Third Infantry reached here late this
afternoon and immediately started for
Bear Island. It is thirty miles distant
and progress will necessarily be slow.
No courier has reached here from
Bear Island to-day, so it is impossible
to learn the result of to-day's fight.
A posse of citizens succeeded in land
ing c-n Bear Island, a cured the bodies
of four of the men killed in Wednes
day's fight and brought away nine
wounded soldiers. The citizens were
driven to their boats by Indians firing
from the bush, but no fatalities are re
ported.

If they are safe from annihilation, must j

with overcoats and blankets. They ;

short when they landed and they were
in no shape to stand a long siege.
Another special train will leave j
Brainerd to-night with 200 or 250 more j
soldiers. Inspector Tinker expr
the opinion that with f>oo soldiers the ;
Indians will be subdued, hut thinks \
there will be much bloodshed.
It Is said the Indians from the Mille
Lacs reservation have started, 300
strong, to join the Leech Lake Indians,
and if this Is the case it will require
500 additional troops to quell the dis
turbance. They are reported to be well
armed and going northward at a rapid
rate. They will probably reach Leech
Lake and Bear Island by daylight to
morrow.

GOME TO THE END
r MINNEAPOLIS, Oct. 6.â The Journal's special from "Walker,
Minn., says:
Major Wilkinson was shot through the leg. but had his wound
dressed and took the field again. Shortly afterward he was shot
through the body. Lying in a pool of blood, he raised himself on
one elbow and shouted to General Bacon:
"Give them hâ l, general; never mind about me."
These were the last words of the gallant soldier.
Major Wilkinson was shot and killed while walking up and down
admonishing the men to keep their heads low.
No braver man or better ofHoer ever lived. The men in his com
mand are crazed with rage. When reinforcements arrive they will
wreak vengeance on the Pillagers in their own way. The fight is
not half over yetâ the biggest battle remains to be fought.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 6.â Major M. C. Wilkinson was well known
among the Northwestern people at Washington. Major Wilkinson was
a volunteer in the Civil War, serving throughout that conflict, and re
ceived on its close a commission in the regular army. He had par
ticipated in several Indian campaigns since the rebellion. His regi
ment was stationed at Fort Snelling for twelve years and was dis
patched to Santiago at the opening of the war, but he was left at the
fort on recruiting service. He was over 60 years old, and his family
are at Redlands, Cal.. where he has for two years been starting an
orange grove, with a view of spending his closing years there.
fifteen or twenty Indians going north,
and it is believed that they are an ad
vance guard of the Mille Lacs Indians,
or a party of their scouts. The men
were not close enough to say whether
they were painted or not, but know
they were armed.
The inhabitants at Walker. Lothrup
and Hackensack. Minn., are terrified
beyond measure and are armed as far
as arms and ammunition are procur
able. Little sleep is taken by the ma
jority of the citizens.
Since the uprising of th^ Bear Island
Indians, the Indians at the Leech Lake
agency have been quiet up till to-day,
but word has arrived to-night from the
agency that th? Indians have broken
out arid the authorities have no control
over them, and fear there will be more
bloodshed.
OFFICIAL REASSURANCES.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 6.â Up to 10
o'clock to-night there had been no in
formation received by the War Depart
ment officials from General Bacon.
During the evening, however, the de
partment received from the general's
adjutant, now at St. Paul, the follow
ing telegram, giving a summary of con
ditions as far as that officer was able
to obtain them:
ST. PAUL.. Minn.. Oct. 6.â Adjutant Gen
eral. Washington: In answer to a tele
gram to the United States Marshal at
Walker, Minn.. I have received a reply,
giving the location of General Bacon on
the mainland on the southwest corner of
Leech Lake and saying: "Commenced
fighting at 11:3*) yesterday. Indians seem
to have best position. Not moving. Ma
jor Wilkinson, five soldiers and two In
dian police killed; awaiting reinforce
ments."
Press dispatches and private Western
Union dispatches seem to support these
statements about the killed. Reinforce
ments will doubtless reach the command
this evening 1 . Reliable information indi
cates the Indians quiet in the vicinity of
dams to the northwest. No report yet
from General Bacon. Only one of the
captains, Gerlach. for duty at Snelling
and 150 men. Apprehend no need for
further reinforcements unless to send to
vicinity of I^eech Lake dam to cut off
escape of Indians. Would suggest au
thority to be given to utilize one bat
talion Minnesota volunteers in case of
need. Report just received of arrival of
Colonel Horbach's command at Walker,
about 4 o'clock. STT'RGIS,
Assistant Adjutant General, in the ab
sence of Department Commander.
The request to use a battalion of the
Minnesota Volunteers was promptly
granted and the department command
er can have his pick from either the
Twelfth or Fourteenth State regiments.
One is at New Ulm and the other at
St. Paul awaitine their muster out.
General Corbin feels that there will not
be any necessity to use the men of
these regiments, however, as the regu
lars will be sufficient for all purposes.
During the evening Secretary Bliss
received the following telegram from
Inspector Tinker, which indicates that
reinforcements have reached Walker,
which Is thirty miles or less from the
scene of the fighting:
WALKER. Minn., Oct. 6.. via Brainerd.
Two hundred and fifteen officers and
men have just arrived with one Gatling
gun. Have heard nothing from the bat
tle ground since morning. Two boats left
to go to General Bacon's assistance and
have not returned. Will wire full partic
ulars later. TINKER, Inspector.

UNIVERSITY STUDENTS
GREET HENRY T. GAGE
A Masterly Address Delivered to the Young
Men of the College
Town.
A Clear and Definite Arraignment of the Principles
Represented by Maguire in the Present Cam
paign-Tendered a Grand
Ovation.
Among the many speeches which the
Hon. Henry T. Gage will have made be
fore the day of election he will probably
have reason to remember the one made
by him yesterday afternoon in Berkeley
before a throng of enthusiastic college
students.
The whole occasion was a decidedly
unique affair, with a strong college flavor
to everything about it. From the moment
the Republican standard-bearer stepped
off the train at Berkeley station until the
time he took leave of the committee that
had acted as his escort he was treated to
"a royal ovation.
By a special order of President Martin
J. Kellogg all exercises in the university
were suspended shortly before 3 o'clock.
I^ong before that hour Stiles Hail was
made the central point of interest in the
university town. The seating capacity of
the building is small at best, but to-day
it was ludicrously insufficient to accom-
modate the people that tried to ga'n an
entrance. Hundreds were turned away,
while within the room itself was crowded.
Behind the speakers" platform were
draped the stars and stripes, and on the
walls were hung the pictures of Gage and
Neff. The audience was clearly in a
patriotic mood, and its feeling found ex
pression in rousing cheers and college
even before the Republican candi
date for chief executive stepped upon
the rostrum.
A committee, consisting of A. ML
Magee, C. E. Thomas, Harry A. Linscott,
Duncan McDuffie and B. H. Donnell, met
the candidates' party on its way over
from San Francisco, and conducted the
members to the place of meeting. Henry
T. Gage was accompanied by Judge Van
R. Paterson, who was also one of the
speakers of the day. Their entrance into
the hall was the signal for an out
burst of applause, which broke out again
and again whHe the speaking was going
on. The university men cheered McKin
ley, they cheered Dewey, and they cheered
Schley, and when all was over they
shouted for Henry T. Gage.
President A. M. Magee of the Gage
Club, recently formed by the college stu
dents, with a few brief remarks intro
duced the man after whom the club is
named.
Mr. Gage spoke as follows:
Gentlemen of the University of Califor
nia: While I am very much gratified by
this pleasing reception, it is with some
diffidence that I address you, because my
own early struggles denied me the oppor
tunity, with which you are afforded, of a
thorough university training:. My educa
tion, beginning and ending in the puDlic
schools, has, however, none the less made
me an admirer of the higher education
â¢which it is the duty as well aa the desire
of the people of California to supply to
our young people.
With fhe higher de
velopment of our
facuuies the purer
and stronger we be
come, politically as
well as ethically. In
deed, ethics and
politics should be in
separably united, for
the reason that In
the education of the
morals as well as the
Intellect of the young depend the liberties
of the people. A free mind is indispens
able to a free man, and mental freedom
requires the development of the moral as
well as the intellectual faculties.
That patriotism increases with educa
tion has been gloriously manifested in this
very seat of learning during the recent
war, when Berkeley sent forth gallant
volunteers in greater proportion to the
population than any other part of the
State.
CROWN OF CITIZENSHIP.
From you. gentlemen, with the high and
scholarly attainments developed by ac
complished professors and tutors, the
people hope to select their future states
men and leaders of public opinion. The

common school is the crown of citizenship
and the university is the scepter. (Great
appla;:
<>ur State branch of the great party
which now sustains and guides our na
tional policy under the statesmanship of
President McKinley, alive to the pressing
need of continuing and improving tna
high grade and scholarship in this great
university, has pledged it~eTf as follows:
"The University of California has in <iie
past been the recipient of the care of tha
Republican party, under whose liberal
support it has been enabled to reach its
present high standard. We pledge our
selves to continue that support and make
the university worthy in every respect of
the most enthusiastic hope of the people.
It fitly crowns the educational system of
the State."
I assure you. gentlemen, that, il elected
Governor, I win faithfully keep my part
of that pledge and will do everything in
my power to assist your professors and
tutors in making your university the peer
of any in the Lnlted States. (Applause.)
I am pleased to find you so deeply in
terested in the politics of your State, fur
it is only through a jealous guardianship
of its political affairs by men of educa
tion that the evils which menace us at all
times, through the arts of the dema
gogue and the insidious wiles of those op
posed to representative government, may
be overcome and the liberties of the peo
ple maintained.
LOYAL TO REPUBLICAN PRIN
CIPLES.
I take this opportunity to thank you fÂ»r
the zeal manifested for my candidacy and
especially for the marked approval shown
by the formation of a college club under
my name. I do not. however, vainly be
lieve that this approval is due to any of
my individual acts, but is only an expres
sion of your loyalty 10 ihe grand princi
ples of the Republican party of which I
am an humble representative. (Applause).
Your division into parties in this uni
versity is proper in the sense that it
arouses discussion of principles, an
discussion will enable the students of the
university to determine wnat will b<- btst
for the interests of the State and nation.
Touching the issues of this campaign, I
will confine myself to a brief statement of
a few important matters to which I wish
to direct your attention, and which. I am
convinced, materially affect the present
campaign.
One of the main subjects for considera
tion is substantially presented through
the personal activity of the leader of the
three diverse parties
opposed to the Re
publican party in
theory of single tax
â a theory gathered
and formulated by
Henry George from
the socialism of Eu
rope. I am satisfied
that the sound in
struction which you
have received in po
litical economy from
the learned professors of this uni
versity will enable you to analyze
and easily refute the pernicious principles
which form the basis of this scheme for
the destruction of land tenures. I will
here but briefly call your attention to
some of the public acts and speeches of
my distinguished opponent. Hon. James
G. Maguire. who has for years advocated
in Congress this anarchic doctrine now
denounced by the Republican party, and
whose Congressional acts and speeches,
including those upon single tax. have been
heartily indorsed and commended by the
platform of the new fusion Democracy.
MAGUIRE AND SINGLE TAX.
Mr. Maguire's public acts and utter
ances on the single tax being indorsed
by the new Democratic party platform. I
will call your attention to his record in
Congress upon the socialistic and land
confiscating theory which his party has
adopted in nominating and approving the
acts of the avowed enemy of land owner
ship by the people. The first single tax
effort of Mr. Maguire was Januai
\ i4 s4. just seven years* after his with
drawal from the Democratic party and
the return of the changed and purified
Democracy to Mr. Maguire. When the
Democratic revenue bill (popularly called
the Wilson bill) was before the House of
Representatives. Mr. Maguire. the Demo
cratic representative from the Fourth
Congressional District of this Sta:-
January' 31, IS&4. introduced a single-tax
amendment to the Wilson bill, providing
for a direct annual tax of $31,311,325 to be
assessed and laid upon the value of all
lands in the United States, exclusive ar.<l
irrespective of the improvements thereon,
and among other things used the follow
ing language in his speech in support of
this extraordinary measure. As Mr. Ma
guire may possibly have forgotten this
and as he" has heretofore called upon me
to give the record I will quote the fal
lowing part of his revised speech from
the Congressional Record of date Feb
ruary 11. IS&4. Vol. 26. No. 24. indicating
his views upon American property rights.
Mr. Mag\iire then said:
QUOTES FROM THE RECORD.
"My amendment proposes a tax on that
unearned Increment as a substitute for
the taxes on other Incomes prescribed in
the bill which has been offered as an
amendment to the Wilson tariff bill. â¢ â¢
â¢ It Is understood by you, as well as by
me. to be the assertion of a principle
which, if conceded to be sound, must ul
timately transfer the entire burden of all
taxation for the purposes of supporting
our Federal. State, county and municipal
governments, from all other subjects to
the value of the lands of the country;
lltimate'.v arpropriating the rental value
Â«f all land, exclusive and irrespective of
ts improvements, to public use. . â¢ â¢ â¢
My proposition" to Impose all taxes for
public purposes upon the value of land,
exclusive and irrespective of the improve
ments thereon, and to abolish all other
forms of taxation, necessarily involves
the idea that there is an essential, fun
damental difference between private
property in land and private property in
other kinds of wealth. â¢ * â¢ There ia
a natural right of ownership in the rela
tion existing between everything pro
duced by labor and the labor that pro
duced it. * * * But there is no such
natural right as a basis for private prop
erty in land. No man made the land. It
is the common heritage of all mankind.
â¢ â¢ â¢ The denial to any man of access
to that natural source of subsistence is
equivalent to a denial of his. right to live,
and any interference with such right of
access must correspondingly subject him
to privation and misery. It therefore fol
lows that the ownership of the land by
one class of men. enabling that class to
fix the terms on which all others may
have access to it. gives to such class
unlimited power of extortion ana oppres
sioÂ»over all landless people. It creates
a dominant and a servient class among
the people of every community In which
such ownership exists, and makes social2
and political equality between those
classes absolutely Impossible, regardless
of any nominal declaration of such an
tutes or constitutions. We
i ready .1 nation of landlords, tenants
tramps The landlords own the
d the others are disassociated
from its soil, having no more stake in
the country than lodgers have in their
liner-house. * * â¢ It thus appears
that ly element In our present
m <>f land tenure is not only in con
travention of natural rights, but is abso
: the genera] happi
of mankind, and is wholly incom
!e with the conditions of social and
â¢ quality necessary to the per
tion of public government."
SINGLE TAX AND MINING.
Notwtthatandlng this remarkable effer
nce of socialism by Mr. Maguire
just quoted, denying all private property
in land and â 
ing the Govern
ment's right to tax
personal property,
one might have ex
pected that he
would concede the
right of the miner
on public mineral
land to the ore and
metal extn
from the land, or
that he would ad-
mlt his right, by discovery, to have the
land patented, giving him a continuous

pain, has built schoolhouses and de

In the course of the same single-tax
speech just referred to, in his attempt to
defeat the Wilson bill, to relieve the
money-lender from taxation and to im
â¢he burden upon the farmer and
wner, he repudiates the miner's
right to the product of his labor; for,
even as to him. Mr. Maguire Invokes the
sition. 1 read from page
gressional Record of Feb
ruary 11, 1891 The following is Mr.
Maguire's language:
"The margin of production which is
now the share of the non-producer would

nefit of all. This would be just, be
cause the margin of production results in
el! cases from the presence and enter

of great natural deposits, such as coal,
iron, gold, silver, copper, lead, petroleum.
[Silver and the liKe, under the earth,
and forests over the earth; and these de
and forests were prepared and
the Creator for the general,
common use of all mankind. It is right
that their value should be given to the
whole people whenever private individu
xtract them from the earth."
THE ISSUE MADE PLAIN.
Gentlemen: This is one of the "faith
ful ami efÃi i-i -^ n t services" of the leader of
the new Democracy,
for which he bus
been commended by
his party, and those
are some of the
views of him who
-<es to assist
our State mining
property rights. Will
he who has tolled
and perspired in the
depths of the earth.
or the prospector who has suffered hun
ger and thirst in his journey throughout
the arid lands of the State, hesitate to
choose between the Republican party,
which fosters his industry and is pledged
to conserve his vested rights, and the
new Democracy, which*, through its dis
tinguished leader, will deny him. if it
can, the private reward and property
rights to which he is entitled by his
brain, his muscle and his privations? For
tunately for the people of this State, as
well as of the United States, the old
: racy from which Mr. Maguire with
drew in 18y7 was again in power in 1594,
and as Mr. Maguire's new Democrm v
con tail . six members, his single !
tax amendment to the Wilson bill was
helmingly defeated. But the leader '
of the new Democracy did not stop here !
with his plan of divesting the people of
their private rights in and to landed prop
erty. Mr. Maguire rendered more "faith
ful and efficient services" for the single
tax, which have commended him to his
party.
BURDENS FOR THE FARMER.
On the 23d of April, 1597 (as appears
from Vol. 30, No. 32, page 1120, of the
. â¢'ssional Record, Mr. Magulre,
while discussing: the Indian appropriation
bill i:i the 'em upon the single
t;;x scheme of the new Democracy again
gave vent to the following view denying
the right of private ownership in land.
He said:
"The land of every country has ever
been, and is, and must forever remain,
of natural right, the inalienable right of
the whole people, in spite of anything
that may be done to deprive them of
It. Governments may and must regulate
the use of the land, but they should, and
the time is not far distant when all na
tions will, so regulate the use and treat
ment of all land as to preserve inviolate
the common, natural, equal rights of all
their citizens in such lands."
Again, gentlemen, the "faithful and ef
ficient services" which hia party has ap
proved were exhibited by Mr. Maguire In
eech in the House, March 10 18$8
upon the Senate "free homestead" amend
ment to the bill making appropriation."
when he again vehemently expressed his
denial of the right of private ownership
of land and the owner's right to the land's
rise in value, which Mr. Maguire denom
inates, in the language of slngie-taxisra
the unearned increment." In the same
address before the House Mr Maguire
adopted, for the purposes of his argu
ment, one of the early and self-confessed
errors of Herbert Spencer, the English
philosopher an error
committed by Spencer
in 1850, when he was
young and inexperi
enced, and long before
the maturity of his
great sociological
works. I am satisfied
from the rumors or
Mr. Maguire's exten
sive rt-ad ing of politi
cal economy and kind
red subjects, that he
â was well aware at the time that he used
this argument that Mr. Spencer had in
n his "Data of Ethics." frankly ac
knowledged his early error In assuming
that the private ownership in land la not
based upon natural ideas of Justice. In
the "Data of Ethics" Mr. Spencer uses
the following forcible and comprehensive
answer to the basic theory of the single
tax era:
"Were the direct exercise of ownership
to bo resumed by the community without
purchase the community would take
(along with something which Is ita own;
an immensely greater amount of some
thing which is not its own. Even if we
Ignore those multitudinous complications
which, In the course of century after cen
tury, have inextricably entangled men's
claims, theoretically considered, even if
we reduce the case to Its simplest theo
retical form, we must admit that all
which c.-in be claimed for the community
is the surface of the country In its orig
inal unsubdued state. To all that value
given to it by clearing, breaking up, pro
longed culture, fencing, draining, making
roads, farm buildings, and so forth con
stituting nearly all its value, the commu
nity baa no claim. This value has been
given either by personal labor or by labor
),aid for, or by ancestral labor, or else
the value given to it !n such ways has
been purchased by legitimately earned
money. All this value, artificially given.
vests in existing owners, and cannot,
without gigantic robbery, be taken from
them."
UNJUST DISCRIMINATION.
Gentlemen, that these plain principles are
consonant with justice may be seen from
practical illustrations. An Instance may
be ; r iven. A poor man has gone Into an un-
Bettled part of the State and secured,
through the beneficence of the Govern
ment, a homestead of 160 acres of land,
which could not bo sold In the market for
the 'government price of $2 50 per ftcre.
He hns labored for years upon It *and
around it, cutting down trees, building a
cottage and outhouses and constructing'
roads. He has earned for himself, dur
ing years of practical Isolation, an un
certain livelihood, trusting, however, that
in the end the property may become desir
able and marketable. He has at last re
ceived a patent for the land from the
United States, and, being invested with
\ the title, again waits some years for a i
! purchaser. Meanwhile other settlers hive
j taken adjoining tracts. A town has grown |
!up near by. A railroad has established a :
: station there and commercially united this ,
territory* with the cities of the State. Jne
' land of the settler rises Jn value. He
| wishes to improve his condition by celling
all or a portion of his land. He is met j
by Mr. Maguire's denial of his right to
Bell this land at the Increased price. This
rise in value belongs (says Mr. Maguire)
to the whole peopleâ it is the unearned
increment. Therefore, the settler must ue
deprived of this Increase of land value by
the . :. of the single tax.
Take another instance: A miner has
discovered a mint-: has lived in his cabin
on the mountain side for years, delving
the earth and earning a bare subsistence.
He thinks the mine is a valuable one, yet
he has no means of erecting a big stamp
mill upon it and expensive machinery for
extracting the valuable metal. He com
plies with the I'nited States mining laws
.cures a patentâ a title to the earth
and mineral. Other mines are discovered.
Towns grow up in the neighborhood and
railroad connection is made by which the
at comparatively cheap rates,
orted to the city smelting works for â¢
ment. The mine bus become vaiu- ;
able and has excited the cupidity of in- ,
5. He wants to sell the mine, bui la
â - .Mi Magiiire's denial of his pn- I
vate ownership and by the application of |
the single tax. taking away this enhanced i
value, which Mr. Maguire and his party
choose to call the unearned increment.
THE FATE OF THE LABORER.
Still another instance: A poor laborer
in the city buys from his earnings a lot
of land lor lifty dol-
lars. in a remote and
sparsely populated
place. and erects
thereon a dwelling.
For years he daily
travels afoot a long
distance between the
place of work and
town. The city
grows. A street rail
way passes his door,
and the lot increases greatly m vaiue. a
purchaser comes along and offers mm
JIOOO for the land, in addition to the value
of hi? Improvements. He wishes to >â¢â !!.
but Mr. Maguire denies his private own
ership in the land. He tells him that $'.â¢;>â '
of the price offered is an unearned Incre
ment, and deprives him of it by the appli
cation of the single tax. In other words,
the human incentive of gain, which stim
ulates poor and rich aiike. which con
structs the mansion and floral conserva
tory, as well as the cottage and the gar
den, Is to be destroyed through the appli
cation of single tax upon land values.
Take still another Illustration: The pio
neer of the forest, or the settler on the
frontier, who builds himself a home amid
wild beasts and savage human foes, who,
fur years makes his breast the barrier of
civilization and raises a family to own and
till the land he fought and toiled fur. at
last beholds that Bparse settlement fast
transforming Itself into a populous city.
Shall he be denied the ownership of his
land? Shall he be denied, through an in
famous single tax. his right to the land,
because of the claim that the rise in value
Is an unearned Incrementâ that value
which his thrift and Industry and valor
earned? On the other side, behold, the
application of Mr. Maguire's scheme for
the amelioration of mankind. A capital
ist with a half million of dollars, acquired
by inheritance, lends to his needy fellow
men. In different amounts, large sums, at
rates of interest varying from S to 24 per
cent per annum, andâ having no
erty in the communityâ absolutely escapes
taxation through the single tax plan of
Mr. Maguire and his party. A railroad
having millions of dollars worth of rolling
merely having a right of way
over the lands of others, extorting heavy
passenger fares and heavy freights from
its people. Is, through Mr. Maguire's plan
of a single tax. to he wholly exen
The wholesale merchant and monopolist
who "corners" the products of a com
munlty with a view to increase the prices
of the products "cornered," shall hold
those products free from taxation during
the hatching: of his scheme. The millions
of dollars of coin and other personal prop
erty, either lying Idle or changing; hands,
shall, through this scheme of Mr. Ma
p-uiro's, be freed from the burden of con
tributing to the revenue of the State,
county and municipality.
SOLID REPUBLICAN PLATFORM.
Rightfully, indeed, did the Republican
party, in "its platform, denounce such
theories and plans, in the following lan
guage:
"We oppose the doctrine *>f the single
tax, of which the Democratic nominee for
Governor is the apostle, as being socialis
tic and anarchistic, ar.d the practical
workings of which will be to release
stocks, bonds, corporations ami us
from taxation and place all the bui
on the fanners and owners of home
steads." (Cheers and applause- >.
Gentlemen, while I mightâ had he not
carried them into practiceâ concede that
the personal views of Judge Maguir- aa
an individual, upon the single tax and
other revolutionary theories, are imma
terial so far as his private life is con
cerned, yet such views, when entertained
by a possible chief executive of tne Suite,
are of vast importance to the peoplt The
mark of the man becomes then the stamp
of the State. Upon the character and
soundness of the executive officer's opin
ions upon economic and State questions,
depends the character of the administra
tion. If the executive be whimsical, his
policy will be guided by the flights of
his disordered fancy. If the executive
share principles common to socialists, the
State's policy will be directed by those
who worship the red flag. You cannot
separate the biased opinions of an execu
tive from his administration, any more
than you can deny logical sequence to
the act which follows the Casual thought.
(Applause).
THE GOVERNMENT ON TRIAL.
Gentlemen: The real underlying issue
presented to the people means more than
party success. The
battle of ideas,
which is prophetic
of future political
action, makes this a
time of great con
cern, in which local
prejudices should
yield to calm delib
eration. The Repub
lican party, again,
reasserting Its na-
tional principles, maintains as a basic
proposition that the advancement of the
American people and the perpetuation of
their liberties depend upon the retention
of the present system of representative
government, with Its grand system of
checks and balances, alike protecting
minorities from the passions of majori
ties, and preserving the rights of the
whole people from the encroachments of
minorities. Our party now stands, as it
has always stood, for the maintenance of
the constitution and the laws and the
liberty of the people. Its great rival, the
old-time Democratic party, which revered
the constitution, stood at least for law
and order, notwithstanding its erroneous
policy, and nursed a brood of Titanic
statesmen, loyal to the country; but that
Democratic party of the past is either
dead or sleeping. (Applause).
The old debates upon the question
whether Federal powers should be strict
ly construed, and whether the tariff
should be for revenue or protection, are
no longer heard or presented. In place
of that brave and brilliant antagonist
there now appears against us a coalition
of three parties, fused and confused, as
serting In one platform the doctrine of
State's rights, in another the annihilation
of all rights, both of States and individu
als. A change In the constitution, both
State and Federal, is demanded. New
and various governmental theories are
offered to the people â the Initiative and
referendum of socialism, the single tax
of Henry George, the Government owner
ship and management of railroads, tele
graphs, telephones and all public utilities,
the Government operation of railroads as
public highways for all competitors, the
removal of all tariff on imports, and
substitution of direct taxes upon the peo
ple of the States for the support of the
Federal Government, the nationalization
of land, the governmental distribution of
silver and paper money, cheapened by the
sovereign fiat, the abolition or the judicial
writ of Injunction, the election of Presi
dent. Vice President and United States
Senators by a direct vote of the people;
and finally the denial of all Individual
rights by Populism, and the repudiation
of all Federal rights by the fusion De
mocracy.
CONSTITUTION MUST STAND.
An Ingenious leader, pliant to all these
revolutionary demands, endeavors to
elaborate from them a homogeneous sys
tem of government. But, fellow-citizens,
when viewed from a rational position, do
not these demands signify that the prin
ciples of the fusion party have declared
our American representative Government
a failure, and that they will build up for
us a new system which will be based
TIIE SA^ FR A3l CISCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 7, 1898.
upon the theory of popular majorities?
| Not a President nor statesman, from the
great Washington to our present distin
guished Executive, through all changes
and grades of political opinions, has ever
: challenged that glorious constitution or
| denied the wisdom of its magnificent
I principle of checks and balances in the
executive, legislative and judicial branches
;of the republic. More than a century has
elapsed since its adoption. Other nations
have fallen and new nations have risen
in their places. Wars, foreign and do
' mestic, have devastated our country: po
â¢ lltical parties have waged bitter political
j battles; and yet that constitution re
: mained unchanged and dear to the Amer
! lean heart until the year 1596. In that
| year the American people for the first
I time heard the rumble of revolt: for the
first time in their history they were told
that the representative republic was a
i failure; that their liberty was imaginary.
I and that paternalism was the only solu
i tion for individual right and individual
| liberty.
To undo the work of our American
! founders was the effort of the fusionists.
! The constitution-burner was ready with
! his torch, and the life of American rep
! resentative government depended upon
! the ballot. Gallantly to our aid came
: Democratic statesmen and their loyal fol
lower? who loved and believed in the
work 6f their forefathersâ yes, even the
! Democratic strict constructionists of Fed
eral power, seeing the peril, dashed val
1 iantly to our assistance. The ballot de
1 cided the issue and the American consti
tutionâ which bad defied the sword and
I musket â triumphed over the ballots of the
fusionists, thrrmgh the intelligence of the
American electors. (Long continued ap
plause).
Fellow citizens, the constitution-de
stroyer is once more in rebellion. The
contest of 1896. in a crude form, is to be
waged again in this State. We have one
new socialistic issue to mcct â the sinple
tax system of the leader of the fusionists;
a system that was disastrously defeated.
with its founder, by the people of the
United States in 1887. (Applause).
In this contest, as in 1896, we trust in
the reason of American electors as op
posed to passion and prejudice â in the
love of Americans for American institu
tionsâin American respect for courts of
justiceâ in fine, we trust the issue to the
clear heads and brave hearts of all
Americans who adore their flay, revere
the constitution and believe in the rights
of personal liberty and of private prop
erty, vested through the just and equal
administration of American law. (Pto
longed applause and cheers).
LE BRETON'S
LONG KNIFE
FOB SIEBE
A Non-Partisan Row
Explained.
CAUSE OF THE AGITATION
TEN MILLION DOLLARS ADDED
TO TH.t: ASSESSMENT ROLL.
The Institution of Which Mr. LÂ«
Breton Is President Had to
Stand a Raise of
$340,000.
Since Supervisor Dodge's picture in
the Non-Partisan gallery was turned
to the wall and that of John Siebe f'jr
Assessor displayed, Edward J. L.c Bre
ton has been anything but happy. Of
all the long knives flourished in this
municipal contest the one that Le Bre
ton has out for Siebe is the longest and
sharpest.
Among the Non-Partisans are many
of the smoothest of the old-time poli
ticians, and they know that something
more than political revenge Inspired the
onset of Le Breton. It is not difficult
to trace the cause of the Le Breton dis
content. In 1896 Mr. Siebe, as Asses
sor, followed the suggestion of the
State Board of Equalization, and added
to the personal property roll about ten
million dollars of solvent credits, rep.,
resenting the value of loans on stocks
and bonds. This addition to the roll
increased the assessment of the French
Savings Bank, of which Mr. Le Breton
is president, to the extent of $340,UUD.
Other banks were proportionately in
creased according to the amount loaned
on stocks and bonds, but the mana
gers of the other institutions were will
ing to abide by the decision of the
courts on the legality of the Assessor's
action. The slow process of the law
was not suited to the Le Breton notion
of civil administration. The Superior
Court, however, has determined that
the assessment of the solvent credits
was correct according to the constitu
tion, and the question is now on ap
peal before the Supreme Court of the
State.
Whatever opinion the members of the
Board of Equalization may have enter
tained on the question of whether
stocks and bonds were assessable, they
had no doubt that a solvent credit, cre
ated on a loan for which the stocks
and bonds stood as security, was as
sessable and should be taxed. When
Mr. Siebe increased the assessment roll
to embrace property of this kind he re
sponded to a sentiment in the commun
ity that there should be no privileged
classes In the matter of tax paying.
In 1896, when the increase was made
by the assessment of such solvent
credits, there was a great outcry and
some of the bankers fancied that the
ruling' of the Assessor was contrary to
the law. After reflection the interested
parties decided to appeal to the courts
for Justice, and there the question now
rests. Mr. Le Breton Is accredited
with saying that he does not entertain
a feeling of personal hostility toward
Assessor Siebe, but the politicians of
the Non-Partisan convention, and they
are apt ones, aver that Le Breton is
out for revenge on Siebe, courts or no
courts. They fancy that Le Breton in
tends to punish Siebe for following the
repeated directions or suggestions of
the State Board of Equalization.
The ordinary every-day taxpayers
who do not arrogate to themselves all
the virtues of the world are surprised
that the pure and lofty Non-Partisans
should engage In an effort to punish a
public officer for performing his plain
duty. So far as John Siebe is con
cerned, he gained the indorsement of
the convention. He does not want to
reopen the controversy, and his friends
are not anxious that It should be re
opened, but the people who heard the
roars of the discontented capitalist are
inquiring as to the cause of the agita
tion in the Fitch-Phelan convention.
So far as can be ascertained. Assessor
Siebe's ruling In 1K96 caused the Le
Breton agitation of IS9B.

BIG REPUBLICAN RALLY
AT B'NAI B'RITH HALL
Gage, Patton, Kahn, Curry, Murphy and Others
Address a Large and Enthusiastic
Audience.
The Standard-Bearer Delivers Three Telling Speeches
Daring the Evening, in Which He Earnestly
Expounds Some Very Good American
Principles.
One of the larpest and most enthusias
tic district meetings of the campaign was
that held last evening at B'nai B'rith
Hall under the auspices of the
Republicans of the Forty-second and
Forty-third Assembly districts. Gen
eral R. H. Warfleld very ably pre
sided, the Knickerbocker quartet and
a brass band furnished music and the
big audience supplied a large amount of
enthusiasm.
Chairman Warfieid, in modestly stat
ing why he was there, said that while he
was neither in with "the push or the
pull," he had cast his first vote in the
trenches before Petersburg for Lincoln
and had conscientiously voted that, way
ever since.
Julius Kahn, candidate for Congress in
the Fourth District, in a brief and en
tertaining speech to!d of the great en
thusiasm shown at all Republican meet
ings, and concluded that the crowded hail
and confident voters augured well for the
success of the party. He regarded this
campaign as one of vital Importance. It
THREE OF THE MEN WHO SPOKE.
should be made decisive as an indorse
ment of the administration of that able
statesman and patriot, William McKln
ley. Men of all political faiths had
agreed that he was the right man in the
right place in the crisis through which
the country has just passed. It was due
to McKinley that this State should roll
up a grand majority for the Republican
ticket. Referring to the Philippines, Ha
waii, the Pacific cable and Nicaragua
canal, he declared that it was of the ut
most commercial import to California
that Republican Congressmen be returned
to Washington this fall.
"We want more foreign trade," said he,
"carried in American ships, manned by
American sailors. We want a navy sec
ond to none and we have the men to man
them and carry our flag to victory when
ever it is called."
The speaker took occasion to denounce
the efforts that are being made to deceive
the people into the belief that he was
in any way allied to the railroads. Ho
further stated that the railroad Question
appeared to be all the Democratic party
had to stand on, and it had been proved
that that institution was not an issue In
this campaign. The battle cry from now
till November S should be, "California for
progress, prosperity and advancement."
Ex-Judge D. J. Murphy, candidate for
District Attorney, in a well-worded speech
paid a high compliment to the Republican
ticket and platform, and declarod that it
should receive the fullest support of the
people of this State. He referred amid
cheers to Henry T. Gage and Jacob iseff
as two of the most honest and fearless
men in the commonwealth, and said that
the voters would never have cause to re
gret electing them and the balance of the
ticket. In speaking of the local Republi
can ticket and platform, he said that they
were among the best ever put before the
people of this city. The ticket was head
ed by a man against whom slander or
libel was never spoken, and no man could
make a mistake by voting for Charles L.
Fatton. The Republican candidate was a
man who, whether in office or out, would
have as much consideration for the poor
man as for the Nob Hill millionaire.
Judge Murphy closed with some convinc
ing reasons why he should be elected Dis
trict Attorney.
When Charles L. Patton stepped to the
rostrum he was cheered to the echo. Ho
spoke briefly, owing to the failure of his
voice, urging the election of Judge Mur
phy and the ticket as well.
"I have no political record," aaid he.
"I hope I never will be a politician.
Mayor Phelan has been In office two
years. You have observed his course and
know whether it has been good or bad.
However, as leader of a 'convention' he
turned down such men as Freese and
Whelan to further his own ends. As a
politician he has been a success."
Mr. Patton spoke strongly in favor of
the. new charter and told why the city
should own its water works and gas and
electric light plants.
"The water company," said he, "Is
charging us interest on deadwood that
has been accumulating for twenty years
and it is an injustice that ought to be
stopped. I can honestly say that I am
controlled by no political combination â no
bosses; I am no man's man. If I am
elected there will be no man between any
man and mysolf and whatever patronage
may go with the office will be distributed
according to my own ideas of justice and
right."
Jabez Swan sang a clever parody and
Charles F. Curry, candidate for Secretary
of State, made a clever short speech in
which he referred to Maguire as a man
who was "handicapped by his political
idiosyncrasies and damned by the meth
ods of his nominationâ who had accepted
any nomination or platform that came
along." fie believed the election would
show that the Democrats wanted their
Democracy like their whisky, "straight."
James H. Barry, Democratic candidate
for Congress, was classified as "a human
centipede with 1006 legs and a sting on
each leg; who would crawl over a man
and hit him with every sting and then
crawl back and make friends with his
victim." The speaker fired some hot shot
at Mayor Phtlan and retired amid great
applause.
Henry T. Gage received an ovation
when he came to the front. Having ad
dressed two meetings during the evening,
he promised a short speech, and kept his
word. He expressed his gratitude for the
eupport given him in the recent conven
tion, referred to the wi.le respect shown
him as the "humble representative of
Republican sentiment," and modestly re
marked that the ticket was a great one,
"with the exception of the head."
In speaking of the manner in which
Democratic papers had criticized his
clothes, boots, hair and grammar, he told
the story of the singing match between
the mocking bird and the crow, in which
a burro was judge, and In which the
mocking bird forfeited his eyes on the
wager. The application of the story was
in the fact that the mocking bird com
plained of nothing except that Its talents
had "been judged by a jackass."
Mr. Gage spoke strongly In favor of the
retention of every foot of soil that had
been won by the valor of our soldiers and
sailors. If the present policy of the Re
publican administration were carried out.
he said, San Francisco would become the
great center of commercial enterprise In
the Western Hemisphere. The Demo
cratic theory was opposed to such ad
vancement and should not prevail.
"I feel confident." he said', "from what
I have seen and heard, that the Republi
can party candidates will be given the
grandest majority ever rolled up in Cali
fornia."
Regarding the designation that he was
"a railroad hireling." he said he con
sidered it a joke, and asserted that if
there was "ever an anti-railroad man It
is he who now addresses you. I never
wanted to tear up tracks or burn depots
â(cheers) â but I am opposed to the inter
ference of railroad corporations or other
corporations in politics. When they do
so Interfere they should be deprived of
their charters. It is a cruel wrong and
dishonest to hold me up to public graze
as being in any way allied to a railroad
corporation." (
In conclusion ho said that he expected
to be elected, and if he was he would
give an administration not controlled by
or pledged to any influence â "one that
would be right and just to all my fellow
creatures."
The meeting concluded with three min
ute speeches by A. B. Treadwell, Judge
Joaehimsen, Thomas Graham, Charles
A. Low, A. C. Worthier, I. J. Truman,
William Deane and Henry N. Clement.

GAGE, PATTON AND LOUD.
A Rousing Reception Given
Them and Others in the
Forty- Fir?t.
Standing room was at a premium in
Tilton Hall, Union and Octavia streets,
last evening, the occasion being a grand
Republican rally under the auspices of
the Forty-first District Club to greet
Henry T. Gage. Hon. E. F. Loud. Charles
L. Patton and other candidates for office.
There was a band and bonfires, singing
and lots of enthusiasm to make it a pleas
ant gathering. H. C. Flrebaugh presided,
assisted by Secretary J. S. Daley.
When the Republican candidate for
Governor entered the hall he was greeted
with loud applause and cheers. He re
ceived the ovation graciously by saying:
"This ardor Is not displayed for any one
man, but the party that the man repre
sents." While discussing the equality of
men he said that he has always been an
active laborer in his profession, and if he
is honored by election the laboring man
and the capitalist will be treated with
equality and justice. He said that since
his nomination he has been unjustly
treated by his opponents, who declare
that he is a "railroad" man. yet his first
speech in public was against the Central
and Southern Paciric railroads.
The speaker paid his compliments to his
opponent, Maguire, and the single tax
hobby of the latter, and made use of the
unique expression that Maguire or any
one advocating such a theory would not
dare to put his fingers in his ears for fear
that the wheels inside would cut off the
ends. Mr. Gage, in speaking of the rail
road question, advanced the idea that
with the Philippines and Hawaii as a part
of the country's territory, the Nicaragua
canal built, the Siberian railroad con
structed, California will experience such
prosperity as never witnessed in the
world beforeâ and this will dispose of the
railroad "bugaboo" forever. He created
not a little interest by quoting from the
record of Maguire in Congress showing
that the latter had endeavored to put a
single tax rider on the Wilson bill, the
result of which would have been disas
trous to the entire country by taxing the
poor people and leaving untaxed millions
of property in the shape of bonds, stocks,
etc.
Mr. Gage won the hdarts of his audience
by declaring the principles on which he
will conduct the affairs of the State by
saying: "If I am elected 1 will give you
an administration that you will be proud
of â pure, honest, brave, economic, busi
ness-like and not dominated by any rail
road, but satisfactory to all."
Congressman Eugene F. Loud entered
the hall as a welcome friend. He fired a
few hot shots into the pinto camp by
stating that everything that was done in
Congress by the Pacific Coast representa
tives Maguire took to himself the credit
for, while as a fact he was frequently
away from his post of duty playing with
his single tax hobby.
The audience stood up and yelled with
enthusiasm when Charles L. Patton en
tered the hall. His address was short,
but he declared his principles In the same
straightforward manner in which he has
spoken ever since his name was mentioned
for Mayor. He said: "I want your votes
because I will make you as good a Mayor
as you have ever had." His position on
the new charter, dollar limit and payment
of $2 for eight hours' labor to laborers
for the city was clearly set forth fes has
been published.
Among the other speakers were Colonel
Stone, on behalf of H. S. Dibble; T. F.
Graham, for Police Judge: Sig. Bettman,
for Senator; William Deane, for (?ounty
Clerk: C. S. Laumeister, for Railroad
Commissioner; Samuel Guthrie, Judge
Bidwell. B. Fehnemann, and C. P. Curry,
for Secretary of State. The Waterman
Sisters entertained with a number of their
popular songs.

RAILROAD MEN MEET.
Street-Car Employes Listen to
Henry T. Gage and Other
Republican Nominees.
Fully 1000 street railway employes and
their friends filled Washington Hall to
suffocation last night to listen to Henry
T. Gage, Republican nominee for Gover
nor. The meeting was under the aus
pices of the T'nited Railroad Employes
Republican Club, and certainly no more
enthusiastic gathering has assembled dur
ing the present campaign than that of the
knights of the punch and grip. The rail
road band of twenty pieces, tastefully
uniformed and composed entirely of street
railway employes, rendered a number of
patriotic airs during the evening, adding
materially to the enjoyment of the occa
sion. P. J. Manning had charge of the
musical programme, the first number be
ing a song by George Mollne.
A. C. Berthier, Republican nominee for
Recorder, was then introduced and made
a brief speech, after which Jabez Swan
sang a campaign song.
Charles F. Curry, nominee for Secretary
of State, was the second speaker. He
devoted considerable attention to James
D. Phelan, his word picture of that latest
Democratic boss affording much amuse
ment to his hearers.
Julius Kahn, Republican nominee for
Congress, was next called upon. While
he was speaking Chirles L. Patton and
Judge D. J. Murphy entered the-hall. Mr.
Patton was greeted with great enthusi
asm as he made his way to the platform,
the railway men standing on chairs and
cheering while the band played "Yankee
Doodle."
When quiet was restored Mr. Patton
was introduced to the audience. He
spoke briefly, as he had another meeting
to attend in a distant part of the city,
but he availed himself of a recess the
chairman ordered to shake hands with
everybody present.
Police Judee C. A. Low and "W. A.
Deane. nominee for County Clerk, fol
lowed Mr. Patton, and then George Baker,
a conductor on the Mission-street line,
delighted the crowd with a charmingly
rendered ballad.
Judge Murphy was In the midst of a
tribute to the worth of Henry T. Gage
when that gentleman entered the ha)l.
He was instantly recognized and â¢ the
demonstration that greeted the appear
ance of Mr. Patton was renewed. The
cheering continued for several minutes
and loud calls were made for "Gage."
The gubernatorial nominee, however. In
sisted that Judge Murphy finish his ad
dress.
When Mr. Gage arose to speak he
plainly showed the effects of his hard
campaigning. He said he had already
addressed three immense gatherings and
his voice was somewhat the worse for
wear. After answering his opponent's
oft-repeated assertion that he was the
creature of corporation influences Mr.
Gage turned his attention to the doctrine
of the single tax which Judge Maguir*
has so loner and earnestly advocated.
After quoting from the Democratic State
platform wherein it indorses the acts of
the Democratic Senators and Represen
tatives and referring to Maguire's course
in offering an amendment to the Wilson
bill substituting the single tax as a reve
nue measure, Mr. Gage asserted that by
its platform the Democratic party In
dorsed the single tax and the question
therefore became an issue of the cam
paign despite Judge Maguire's assertions
to the contrary.
Mr. Gage proceeded to explain some of
the vagaries of the single tax, and for the
first time many of his hearers learned
what the "confusion" nominee meant by
his "unearned increment." They were not
infatuated with its workings, as explained
by Mr. Gage, and did not hesitate to
voice their disapproval.
After explaining how Judge Maguire
would paralyz^ the mining industry of
the country by his process of confiscation
Mr. Gage stepped down from the plat
form and shook hands with those present
while the band played the "Star-Spangled
Banner."

EXPOSES THE
EXAMINER
Sought to Aid Maguire
by Evasion.
A LETTER WAS SUPPRESSED
FALSEHOOD AND MISREPRE
SENTATION.
Petty Methods by Which the Third-
Streot Organ Hopes to
Influence Public
Opinion.
It has remained I â  a! W. 11.
â 
.vhich the
Exam ly the
avalanche of public disfavor that is
-c Maguire as
the leader of the Democratic-Populist-
Sllver Republican hosts. The exact
manner in which the Third-street organ
has this time undertaken to whiten the
ilagruire person by misrepresentation
and the suppression of facts is fully
set forth in the following communica
tion from General Barnes:
Edkor Call: After I noticed in the Ex
aminer of yesterday the parallel column;
displaying my earlier and later statements
about Judge Maguire; I prepared an arti
cle which i requested the manager pro
tern.. in Mr. Lawrence's absence, to pub
lish. In reply to my telephone message
he sent to my ollice a gentleman to whom
1 delivered the manuscript which he said
would be substantially printed. This was
not done. Instead, an interview appeared,
treating the case from t!;e Examiner !
standpoint, accompanied with a fair ;
sketch of my writing table in my private j
office, to which I admitted him. On the ;
table were several photographs, two of t
favorite animals of mine, one of my asso- \
date. D. A. Ryan; and also two photo- j
graphic copies of portraits painted by
Fred Yates. presented to me by the artist i
â when he called to say good-by on his I
recent departure for Japan. I had (com- â 
mended him as a painter to Mr. Hunting- ;
ton, and he had painted my portrait for I
the Bohemian Club. He placed both on j
my table, where they have since re- i
maine To what use the reporter put my j
civility in receiving him any gentleman i
may judge.
The article above referred to and of
â¢which you request a copy is as follows; I
should bo pleased if you can find space I
for it:
"To the Editor of the Examiner: In an
article under the heading of "James G.
Maguire as seen by General Barnes then
and now,' you produce, with some edi
torial comment, a statement of mine in an
Examiner interview, on October 27. 1537,
tnd a paragraph supposed to be from a
speech ide by me in San Diego, Sep
tember 26, IS9S.
"I desire to say that I affirm both state
ments. I doubtless made both. Each fully
represented my sentiments at the time I
made it. I have not changed my views
except as the change has been reluctantly
forced upon me tv Judge .Maguire him
self.
"At the tima I was interviewed by the
Examiner Judge Maguire had not op
posed with all the mental force at his
command the annexation ot the Hawaiian
Islands. He had not then joined with a
lot of rattle-weeded Democrats and Popu
lists in au attempt in the Fifty-fifth Con
gress to substitute an issue of one hun
dred and fifty million dollars of irredeem
able greenbacks in the place of bonds
bearing three per cent Interest per annum
as proposed by the Republicans, and
which latter financial scheme was finally
adopted by both houses of Congress. He
had not then done all in his power to
create the impression that the issue of
greenbacks was vastly preferable to
bonds, because greenbacks were in the
nature of a non-Interest bearing debt,
while the bonds drew three per cent per
annum interest. He had not at that time
favored the use of non-interest bearing
bonds. He had not then become a Popu
list. Ho had not then addressed his letter
of August 22. IS9S, to the chairman of the
State Central Committee of the People's
party containing the following language:
â¢' "1 take pleasure in advising you that I
have accepted the platform adopted by
the convention, and herewith return the
same to you. signed as requested by your
committee. â¢ â¢ * Assuring you that I
â will faithfully and earnestly devote my
self to the accomplishment of these com
mon purposes, I remain, sincerely yours,
.^, c " 'JAM' G. MAGUIRE. 1
T.nss State platform reaffirmed the
principles enunciated in the last national
platform of Populist absurdities, and
Judge Maguire was from that day com
mitted to the irrational financial idea of
national money issued by the general Gov
ernment only, as a full legal tender for
ail public and private debts, to be dis
bursed by the Government to the people.
"He committed himself to the doctrine
that there should be no myr<? gold coin
private contracts. He pledged himself to
a graduated income tax. although he
knew that such a tax was unconstitution
al: He committed himself to the prepos
terous proposition that the United States
Government should take possession and
assume ownership of all railways and tel
e-graph lines in the United States. He
demanded that the Government should
retake possession of all lands in the
United States, however acquired by their
owners, whether by patent from the Gov
ernment or mease conveyance from pri
vate individuals, which are in excess of
the actual present needs of the owner to
sustain life. He pledged himself to the
Impracticable scheme of the initiative
and referendum. He declared that th*
salaries of public om'cera, judicial, legis
lative ar.d executive, should not exceed
the average wages of the common laborer.
"He demanded that greenbacks, the con
stitutionality of whose issue was always
more than doubtful, should never be re
tired, and that the present safe national
bank system should be abolished; that
there should be no notes except 'national
money,' which should be easy of distri
bution to those who needed it. He de
manded that the United States should
never, hereafter, issue any Interest bear- :
Ing bonds, no matter under what condi
tions or under what pressing necessity,
thougn he know they were the only clas.s
of securities that could be put upon the
money markets of the world
"He demanded the immediate fore
closure o. liens of the Government on the
Central Pacific and Western railroads,
though he knew that Senator Morgan of
Alabama and Senator White of Califor
nia id agreed upon a measure for the
disposition of the railroad debts to the
Government, which had unanimously
passed the Senate and went through the
House of Representatives without Mr
Magulre's objection.
"He demanded the repeal of the polltax
law and a constitutional amendment per
mitting counties and municipalities to
choose their own methods of taxation for
local purposes, which, as he himself de
clared to the Examiner on November 6
ISOS, is the first step toward single tax!
fend, at the same time, declared that with
a constitutional amendment covering
this .position the battle would be on in
earnest.
"Judge Maguire had not then, to my
Knowledge, in the course of a speech de
livered in the House of Representatives
January 27, 1597. on the immigration re
striction bill, declared that the exclusion
from the United States of anarchists, ho

The only opposition to a nominee was
when tho name of John H. Grady

a delegate who is slightly deaf, or ap
peared to be bâ¢, r * and protested
against the nomination. "I oppose him."

I an unconvicted perjurer." There was a
i general howl from the other delegates and
Chairman Miller yelled to Warren that he
; must not indulge in personalities. War

and the ehaitman yelled the louder amid
the cheers of the delegates. Warren
thereupon took his seat.
Several Republicans were nominated,
but the majority of thtj nominees were

OPINIONS ON THE
DEMOCRATIC SIDESHOW
THANK J. SYMMES EXPLAINS
WHY HE RESIGNED.
Some Expressions From Delegates
Who Attended the Non-Parti
san Convention.
The Xnn-Partisan convention having
completed its labor of indorsing 1 Demo
cratic candidates for office, the following
opinions relative to the work of that body
as expressed by some of those who at
tended its sessions are timely:
Frank J. Symmes said that he would
prefer net to be quoted regarding his
opinion of the Non-Partisan- convention,
having already openly expressed himself
on the convention, and not wishing to
pose ai? a disgruntled member, lie did
say. however, that "what is honest and
right in an individual is equally honest
and right for an association of Indi
viduals.
"If it is wrong for an Individual to vio
i late an obligation it is a greater wrong
â  In a convention which claims to be trying
; to secure an honest administration of mv
! nlcipal affairs and demands pledges from
! its candidates. Whr-n it was perfectly
j easy for the Non-Partisans to go before
â¢ the people with a good record it was ab
solute folly to publicly violate its own
principles and destroy its own influence.
It is no sin to nominate tr.cn from its own
body, but suicidal to Its influence to do bo
unless they have a clean record. Probably
1 a more experienced man than I am in con
i ventlon work would have presented the
i question In an acceptable way. Had Mr.
Sullivaji proposed my motion it would
surely have carried without discussion.
I would not impugn the motives of any
member of the convention, but there was
an influence there which I have not been
able to understand. All of my friends,
save one, were hypnotized into perfect si
lence. Mind you, I am not disgruntled
just because my motion failed, and. jmt
haps I was silly to resign, but I am dead
sure that nine-tenths of the members of
that convention know that I am right.
"It did provoke m.' to see that the con
vention would build up such a magnificent
platform of professed virtues and then
not only knock out the best cornerstone <>f
it but leave n keg of dynamite in its place
for its enemies to blow up the whole fab
ricâand nil because the sucgr-stion to
cart away the dynamite came from ;i
new member in the ranks*. Men must rise
to broader principles if they expect to se
cure any permanent influence among the
people."
V/. M. Abbottâ l will not stultify myself
by going in with the Non-Partisans ngain.
T was not willing to heli"ve it so, but
when the indorpement of Supervisors came
v\> it was so evident the convention was
doing partisan Democratic politics that I
had enough of it. When they got nine of
the twelve and tried hard to get a tenth
I think It is unfair and not non-partisan
by any means. Had they secured that
tr-nth Supervisor there are many who
would have '.eft the meeting.
John R. Hillmanâ l am well satisfied
with the work of the convention. The
ticket is a strong one. and I believe It
will be so demonstrated on election day. I
Mayor Phelan's administration has given '
such general satisfaction that there Is â 
no good reason why he should not be
eted. I would have liked to have j
seen a few more Republicans on the tick- !
et. but in a large number of cases the
Democrats were to all appearances and I
after careful investigation found to be j
superior to those nominated by the Re- j
publicans, and therefore there are more
of tho former on our ticket. I would, |
however, liked to have seen Fitzgerald
and Louderback given a place.
J. R. Howeilâ l accepted an appointment
as a member of the Non-Partisan con
vention several weeks ago in perfect
good faith, for while I have always been
a consistent Republican in national poli
tics, I have always felt at perfect lib
erty to mako my own selection of mu
nicipal candidates regardless of politics.
Concerning the ticket just completed
by the Non-Partisan convention, I am
not prepared at present to express any
opinion on its merits from a Non-Parti
san standpoint.
BRILLIANT CAMPAIGN.
Prospects of Republican Success in
the Sixth Congressional
District.
Among the callers at headquarters of
the Republican State Central Committee
yesterday were R. J. Waters, Republican
nominee for Congress in the Sixth Dis
trict, and the eloquent orator, Will A.
Harris, of Los Angeles. They have just
conculded a speaking tour of the Con
gressional district and are encouraged
over the prospects of Republican success.
The meetings in the northern end of the
district throughout the counties of San
Luis Obitpo, Monterey and Santa Cruz
were quite as large and enthusiastic as
those held in Santa Barbara, Ventura and
Los Angeles counties. At every point old
line Democrats signified a determination
to vote for Republican nominees in pref
erence tv fusionists.
Will A. Harris is one of the gifted ora
tors of the State, and the desire to hear
him is constantly increasing. The fact
that he is a son of a distinguished Con
federate leader and was formerly a Dem
ocrat himself brings many men of his
kind to the Republican rallies. Through
out the district the speakers found a vig
orous sentiment in all parties in favor of
vi holding the administration of Pre-
BlcKlnley and the retention of territory
conquered from Spain by the valor of
American soldiers and sailors.
Some time during the campaign the peo-
San Francisco will have the pleas
ure of listening t<> An address from Mr.

to Manila.

TO REORGANIZE
CALIFORNIA'S
FIGUTIIG FORCE
Governor Budd Gives
Necessary Orders.
THE FIRST WILL BL FIRST
NEW EQUIPMENT FOR THE NEW
MILITIA.
More Than Enough Money Due
From the Government to
iry for New
Arms.
California is to have plenty of martial
glory at home as well as abroad.
Governor Budd :i;;s decided that the
Second Brigade. Is*. G. C, shall be reor
ganized, and has so notified General War
field, so that when the l>oys of the old
"First" pet back from foreign wars with
a prist of tales to tell of deeds done they
will have the boys of the new First to teil
them to, besides a dozen or more oth>.r
regiments.
General Warfield. commanding the Sec
ond Brigade, said last night that the
work of recruiting the Firsi I--- siment had
already begun, and the recruits will be
mustered in by companies as soon as the
minimum quota of fifty is attained.
The Fifth Regiment will follow the First
into the State's service, and then will
come the remaining brigades.
Colonel Giesting ami Majors Jansori and
Margo, who are effecting the reorganiza
tion, say the twelve companies of the
First will have been mustered in at the
end of the six weeks to com-'.
eral Warfield is informed that there
[a more than enough money now due the
I State from the Government to equip
I every regiment in California, and this
will be done, and oniy the best, newest
| equipment issued. The boys will be
i armed with the guns now stored in Be
i nicia barracks.
General Barrett and Colonel Burgin are
now in Washington for the purpose of a
settlement with the Government of the
State's account.
Reorganization will not be delayed by
thr-ir absence. ;.s Assistant Adjutant gen
eral Peeler is acting here in General Bar
rett's stead.
General Warfield has decided that mem
bers of the old First who did not go to
Manila and who desire to re-enlist, shall
have only the balance of their time under
the old enlistment to serve Jn order to
get their exemption.
The general is confident that he will
have no trouble in rapidly recruiting his
whole brigade.
NOT READY TO PROCEED.
The Assault to Murder Case Against
Policeman Kenville Again
Continued.
The case of Policeman Frank J. Ken
ville. charged with assault to murder,
was called in Judge Mogan's court yes
terday morning. Prosecuting Attorney
Splnetti said be was ready to proceed on
behalf of the prosecution, but on behalf
of the defendant it was stated that he
had retained Senator McGowan to repre
sent him. and as he was engaged in tne
Botkin extradition case a continuance was
asked for two weeks. Spinetti oh
to such a loner continuance, and after
i argument the Judge said he would con
tinue the hearing until October 14, but
It must go on then.
The boy Willie Lynch is improving
slowly but surely, and the prosecution
| expects to be able to take his deposition
when the hearing comes up.
School Lumber Steal.
The Grand Jury reached no conclusion
regarding the School Board lumber steal
at 11 o'clock last night. An afternoon
and evening session was devoted exclu
sively to hearing various witnesses and
securing thrlr testimony regarding the
disappearance of the lumber. Alex. Tru
man, Thomas A. Burns and J. O'Brien
were examined. At 10:45 o'clock the jury
asked the prosecutor to retire and a bal
lot was taken. Dame Rumor has it that
the jurors agreed that no indictment was
possible under the circumstances, es
pecially in view of the fact that advice
had been received from the District At
torney that no felony had been com
mitted under the law. It was arranged
that the Grand Jury should meet again
next Saturday morning at 10:30 and the
chances are that a report will be ready
at that time to present to the court.
Gentlemen's Sodality.
On Sunday morning the Gentlemen's
Sodality of the Immaculate Conception
of the Blessed Virgin Mary attached to
St. Ignatius Church will assemble at the
sodality chapel on Hayes street and

dalfty Dramatic Club are rehearsing a
high class drama under the leadership <>f
George Hermance and expect to present
it early in November in the theater of St.
Ignatius College on Van Ness avenue.
The proceeds will be given to the Ladies'
Francesca Relief Society.
Bill for State Roads.
A meeting uf the California Good Roads
League was held in the Mills building
I yesterday. The prime intention of the
meeting was to have the league accept
or reject the text of a proposed bill, which
is to he introduced In the next Legisla
ture, the object of which is to provide
; means of disbursing to the best advantage
the 52.000.000 now appropriated for high

very stormy in character, out upon the
i State committees threat to report to the
State on October 10. without any reiom
mendations from the league, il v. <ts decid
' ed to meet Saturday and get matters Into
definite shape.

tices' Courts yesterday against W. D.
Plowden and Edna Plowden to recover
$100, the alleged value of six Dane pups
which the defendants secured from the
plaintiff.
COUNTERFEITS
WERE PRINTED
IN THIS CIT?
Most Deceptive Bills
Ever Uttered.
GOVERNMENT EXPERTS AT SEÂ«
CLAIM THAT THE INKS AND
PAPER ARE GENUINE.
Five Thousand of the Bogus Hun
dred-Dollar Bills Exchanged
for the Gold of
Klondikers.
Special officers of the United States
secret service, acting in conjunction with
Chief Lees, have traced the origin of the
$100 bills which are such excellent coun
terfeits of the silver certificates issued by
the Government. The imitation is so
close that it can be told from the genuine
only by the application of the acids used
by the officials of the Treasury Depart
ment.
The bills were made in this city, on
Broadway, and the operators are under
police surveillance. Copies of i~e bills
have been turned over to Expert Kytka
of the Police Department. He has ta.\en
enlarged copies of them. These photo
graphs tend to show how skillful were the
men who prepare ~> the bills.
The person who uttered the bills struck,
off 5000 of them and sent them into the
Klondike district. They were readily ex
changed for gold dust, and their falsity
was not discovered until the returning
miners tried to pass them in Portland.
Cash on them was refused, but the vari
ous bank officials agreed to accept them
and send them to the Treasury Depart
ment at Washington for collection.
The banks of this city, following the
precedent of the institutions in the north,
nave refused to handle any bills of that
denomination. The paper is said to be of
Government make, as are also the various
inks, with the exception of that with
which the number is printed. This is of
ordinary quality and cannot withstand
the action of acids.,* The bills are the most
dangerous with which the secret service
officials have ever had to deal.
HIS INJURIES FATAL.
George Keyes Dies in the City and
County Hospital.
George Keyes, a longshoreman, died in
;:>â¢ and County Hospital yesterday
from injuries received during a row with
a man named John Shaughnessy last
Tuesday. The men engaged in a wordy
dispute, which ended in Shaughnessy
striking Keyes, knocking him down. In
falling Keyes fractured his leg in two
places. Shaughnt-ssy was arrested short
ly after the assault and was charged with
rhayhf-m. Hl* victim, after being treated
at the Harbor Hospital, was sent to the
City and County Hospital, where he died
â¢ lay afternoon.
Shaughnessy will be formally charged
with manslaughter to-day.

Grave Problems Require
a Cash Solution.
STRIKE AT THE ARSENAL
AND SPANISH SOLDIERS CLAM
OR FOR BACK PAY.
Peculiar Condition of Affairs at
Havana That May Yet CausÂ»
Delay in Evacu
ation.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HAVANA, via Key West, Oct. 6.â Six
hundred men, machinists, blacksmiths,
skilled workmen and laborers, have
gone on a strike at the Havana arse
nal, refusing to work unless they are
paid five months' arrears of wages. The
strike began on Monday and no settle
ment has yet been made.
The Spanish cruiser Qonde de Vcna
dito, the gunboat Galieia and the tor
pedo-boat Nueva Espana arc- on the
stocks at the navy-yard undergoing
elaborate repairs, preparatory to their
trip to Spain. The arsenal strike is
liable to delay the evacuation, so far as
the navy is concerned, unless the dif
ferences are soon settled, as the vessels
in their present condition are Quite un
equal to a sea voyage, especially at this
time of the year.
The Spanish authorities continue to
declare their inability to evacuate the
island entirely before the end of Feb
ruary. The Washington Government,
through the American Commissioners,
continues to insist up'>n prompt evacu
ation. The Spaniards say, also, as a
reason for delay, that in addition to
the lack of vessels, a large proportion
of their soldiers are too weak and ill
to undertake the voyage during the
winter season.
General Blanco is beset on all sides
with grave problems requiring a cash
solution. Unfortunately, the Madrid
Government is unprepared to meet
them, and the Captain General is thus
placed in a very delicate position. On
the one hand is the navy-yard strike,
on the other soldiers clamoring lor
back pay. Last week Blanco issued
orders disbanding all the provisional
regiments in certain places, as, for in
stance, at Sancti Spiriius, but the
troops refused to disband unless they
first received their arrears of pay.
Many of them went over to the Cuban
ranks.
It has leaked out that, in his extrem
ity. General Blanco summoned the gov
ernor of the Banco Espanol and called
upon him for an advance of money.
The bank official at fust refused, but
finally yielded to Blaneo's appeal and
agreed to advance $200,000. His weak
ness is seriously condemned, many of
the depositors threatening to withdraw
their deposits.
The commercial condition of the
island, instead of Improving, seems to
be at a complete standstill. The un
disguised corruption in every branch
of the administration fills all minds
with distrust.
There are other ominous clouds on
the horizon that indicate early trou
ble with the Cubans, who are now
openly proclaiming their readiness to
fight to the last drop of blood for abso
lute independence.
Distrust and uncertainty as to the
precise policy of the United States
Government with regard to Cuba keeps
the island in a precarious and unsettled
condition.
Havana is excusably alarmed over
the release of 700 Nanigos, who have
been undergoing sentences in Spain's
penal colonies in Africa. These crimi
nals are mostly murderers, belonging to
the Nanigo societies, whose Initiation
rites demand that the neophyte should
murder the first person he meets in the
street after the ceremony of drinking
the hot blood of a cock. If the feath
ers in the cock's tail are black he must
kill a negro; if white, the victim must.
be a white man, and if yellow, or buff,
then a mulatto or a Chinaman.
These Nanigos have long been a
menace to this city, waging their bat
tles in the streets and nomrnitting: ter
rible crimes. During the last few
years upward of 700 of th'-m have been
arrested and sent to Ceuta. The re
port of their release and probable re
turn to Havana fills the population
with dread.
RAY AT MANZANILLO.
The Colonel Will Proceed to Take
Possession of the City.
HAVANA, Oct. 6.â A dispatch received
this morning from Manzanillo reports the
arrival there of the steamer Reina de los
Angeles, flying the stars and stripes, with
Colonel Henry Ray and 400 United States
troops.
Colonel Ray will receive possession of
the city 10-morrow.
Sewerage Club at Grass Valley.
GRASS VALLEY. Cal., Oct. 6.â At the
November election the question of voting
|40,000 in bonds for sewering the city will
fe submitted to the voters. A strong sen-
Iment exists in its favor, and to promote
s. favorable vote a "sewerage club" has
Been formed, with Mayor Parsons as
President. This city is experiencing a
rapid growth, and the progressive citi
tens contemplate other important im
provements if the sewerage system is
adopted.

gram from the Twin City editors was
the subject of a conference at the
White House this evening between the
President, Secretary Alger and Adju
tant General Corbin. It resulted In the
President giving instructions that
ample reinforcements be sent General
Bacon at once. It is understood that
orders in accordance with these in
structions were sent to St. Paul to
night.
VERY BAD MANAGEMENT.
MINNEAPOLIS, Oct. 6.â Arthur I.
Pehler, the staff correspondent of the
Journal, wires at 8:30 this morning
from Walker, Minn.: I got in very
late from the expedition on the Flora.
We started out to carry supplies and
rations to the troops. It was very dark
off shore. We signaled for an hour.
Corporal Nettlekoven using the code in
use at Santiago, but either the troops
have been driven inland or there is not
a man of them left. No answering
signal of any sort was received, al
though we lay off and on the whole
length of the headlands.
To land was an impossibility in the
dark, as the reinforcements from
Brainerd had not arrived and there
was only one old Winchester rifle on
the boat. ' Reddy Lazard, captain of
the Flora, is a "dead game" man, and
he would have landed, but there is no
possible doubt that the small force on
the boat would have been annihilated
if this had been done. There were men
on board who preferred to die in an ef
fort at rescue, however futile it might
have been. We had our blankets and
rations for the bluecoats. If any of
them survive they slept last night in
the open. A heavy frost prevailed
there. There is not so much as a cof
fee bean to divide between the whole
command this morning.
At a later date I am going to tell the
whole truth about this expedition. I
never kne%v of such gross mismanage
ment or witnessed such criminal obsti
nacy as has been exhibited here. The
men of Bacon's command were taken
out under conditions that would dis
grace a militia sergeant, were he re
sponsible for them. Every life that
has been lost here is a useless sacri
fice. It broke my heart to see the poor
fellows dropping. Had a proper force
been sent here in the first place not a
shot would have been fired. I have
hopes that Bacon may have intrenched
himself, and that the failure to answer
signals last night was due to his de
termination not to betray his location.
The men had 120 rounds of ammuni
tion each. I hardly think they have
exhausted their supply.
The newspaper correspondents, Brill,
Beaton and Knappen, are still with the
troops. I went with our force deter
mined to save them if possible, but it
was impossible to locate them. Im
mediately on my return from Bear Is
land I sent my chartered steamer with
Gus Botulcu, a friend of the Chippe
was, who has Chippewa blood in his
veins, to pick the newspaper men up if
there is any such thing. He is now on
that mission, and as he is absolutely
fearless I have strong hopes. Unarmed,
ill clad, out of condition, without food
or drink, the press representatives with
Bacon are in desperate straits.
Corporal Nettlekoven, the sharp
shooter, is worth his weight !n gold.
He dropped a couple of bucks over on
the point yesterday evening with his
Krag-Jorgensen at 2000 yards. Both the
Indians were distinctly seen to stagger
and collapse after he had shot at them.
Our fighting preacher is w r orthy of
distinguished mention. After the pilot
was shot and had gone aboard the
Flora, according to the marshal's in
structions, Rev. Mr. Chandler took the
tiller and, with a storm of Winchester
balls whistling around his head,
brought the boat into port.
Tinker, the inspector, took refuge in
the pilot-house. A ball drove through
the woodwork, perforated the inspec
tor's coatsleeve in two places and also
struck him in the leg. My own pilot,
Oscar, who was shot yesterday while
we were off Bear Island, is doing well.
He will recover, as will Harris, the
marshal.
AGENT SUTHERLAND'S STORY.
WALKER, Mmn., Oct. 6.â lndian
Agent Sutherland, who -was in the bat
tle at Sugar Point, gives the following
account of the conflict up to the time
of hip leaving for supplies:
"When the arrest of the two fugi
tives had been accomplished, the In
dians, with a profession of friendship,
showed the Boldiers their tepees and
celled attention to their neatness, all
the time stating 'Me good Indian.'
"General Bacon, who has had great
experience with the Sioux and other
savages, did not take much stock in
these professions of friendship, and or-
A*ruA a. nart of his company to search
THE SA^" FRAXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 7, 1898.
the adjoining timber for any lurking
savages, but none were to be seen.
They must have been hidden in thick
underbrush, and those unaccustomed to
searching timber could easily have
been deceived, for it was not ten min
utes after this before the firing had
commenced. Had the Indians not con-
templated a general massacre they
would have fired on the men who were
searching the timber. It was in accord
ance with their treacherous nature to
wait until they had our men at a dis
advantage before they opened fire upon
them, perhaps hoping to kill the whole
number at the first volley.
"These Pillagers are well armed and
are good marksmen, therefore it is
easy to see where they had the advan
tage of the situation at the start. If
our men are not all killed, it is sur
mised that they have gone some dis
tance into the woods, where they would
be safe from a night attack from an
other band of Indians who could have
come suddenly upon them on the lake
shore. If it Is true that the Cass Lake
Indians have gone to assist the Bear
Islanders, the fate of Bacon can be un
derstood."
GREAT ALARM AT CASS LAKE.
CASS LAKE, Minn.. Oct . 6.â The
people in this vicinity are in a state of
grave alarm to-night. They fear' that
Pillager bands may flee north, murder
ing, burning and pillaging as they
come. Men who have been familiar
with the Lake Indians for twenty years
or more, especially the Pillager band,
believe the red men will retreat north
as soon as they find themselves out
numbered. However, troops may be
able to cut off retreat by establishing
a line across the neck of Bear Island at
a point west of the island and which
was the ecene of yesterday's hostilities.
This is considered hardly possible in
view of the fact that the reinforcements
are considered not strong enough to at
tack from the shore and at the same
time guard the rear against retreat.
Another probability is that If the In
dians see a further stand is useless
they may seek to escape north in ca
noes, coming to the head of Leech
Lake, thence into Portage Lake and by
portaging across reach Big Fork and so
escape across to the Canadian bound
ary.
Logging contractors who have camps
along the shores of Leech Lake are
afraid the Indians on their way north
ward will massacre the men and burn
the camps. There are only a few set
tlers in the threatened territory, but
there are a great many logging camps
and hundreds of defenseless loggers and
section men who are ballasting a new
railroad are believed to be in gravp
danger.
If all the Indians that could be lined
up were to side with the Pillagers it is
estimated here that a force of 500 or 600
bucks could be massed against the reg
ulars. There are about 150 Pillager
bucks, about 200 at the agency and
about 200 in the two villages near here.
DESULTORY FIRING ALL NIGHT.
MINNEAPOLIS, Oct. 6.â A special to
the Journal from Walker, Minn., says:
The third expedition to the Point has
just started. There are fifteen riflemen
on board, picked men. The boat carries
coffee and provisions. The detail is
under the direction of Dr. Camp of
Brainerd, an old Indian fighter, who
never knew the name of fear. The
troops have had nothing to eat since
yesterday at noon. They have not even
had a drink of whisky to sustain vi
tality. The night was dreadfully cold.
Men without blankets must have suf
fered fearfully. Every man in this town
slept all night with a Winchester across
his arm. The gang that came up from
Brainerd under Dr. Camp are about
as determined a lot as I ever saw.
There is going to be an Indian exodus
here as sure as the sun rose this morn
ing. The temper of the soldiers left
here and at the agency is something to
make a man gasp. Lieutenant Humph
rey is counting the minutes until rein
forcements arrive. This command will
probably be relieved when the fresh
troops come and be given a chance at
the enemy.
DEATH AMONG
MANILA TROOPS
MANILA, Oct. 6.â There have been fourteen cases of smallpox
and six deaths from that disease among the American troops
during the past two days. The dead are:
H. M. Powers, First California.
Harry Wheeler, Second Oregon.
Henry Culver, Fourteenth Infantry.
Joseph Saly, George Cooty and Frank Warwick, Thirteenth Min
nesota.
Eight deaths from typhoid fever have also been recorded. Artil
leryman Roach was killed by a sentry on Wednesday night at Tondo.
There was desultory firing about the
headlands above this town all night.
What it was about I cannot discover.
I think the Indians were signaling in
this manner. There were 200 men under
arms here. I have been to the agency
on my way back here. The Indians
here swear that they are friendly. They
may be telling the truth, but I would
not believe a redskin under oath after
what I have learned of him.
DECIDED TO BE GOOD INDIANS.
MINNEAPOLIS, Oct. 6.â The Jour
nal's Walker special says: There was
a big conference at the agency last
night. Lieutenant Humphrey of the
agency detachment and Dr. Hart, the
agency surgeon, were there, together
with half a dozen bad characters who
had voted in favor of joining the Pil
lagers. Dr. Hart told them that if
they went on the warpath there would
not be a live Indian on Leech Lake in
a week. Lieutenant Humphrey backed
the statement. After several hours'
talk the Indians decided to be good In
dians, at least for the present, but the
assurance may not be worth much.
ALARM INCREASES HOURLY.
CASS LAKE, Minn., Oct. 6.â A1l the
people here that have arms are sleep
ing on their guns to-nigrht, and it is a
pitifully small proportion of the popula
tion. Men began coming in early this
evening with reports of seeing Indians
in parties of five to twelve and all
armed, and appearing as if they were
locking for trouble. As night came on
the reports have continued to come in
and the alarm has Increased. Finally,
business men at 11 o'clock wired a re
quest to Governor Clough for arms and
ammunition for 200 men and for pro
tection in the form of troops. There
is a special train going east that is due
here about 5 a. m., and fears are enter
tained for its safety, as it is not un
likely that the Indians may remove
some of the rails at any point in this
vicinity.
FIFTY DEAD INDIANS.
MINNEAPOLIS, Oct. 6.â A special to
the Journal from Walker says: "I
have just met an Indian named Mah
Ge Guh 80, who came over from Bear
Island in a canoe at 3 a. m. He says
the loss of the whites is ten killed and
fifteen wounded. He denies that the
troops have been wiped out, but says
the Indians have had the best of it.
Their loss, he claims, does not exceed
rive killed and wounded. The force with
Bacon is probably safe, and more en
couragement is felt about it. I have
other information thafc there are fifty
dead Indians within a mile of the land
ing."
MINNEAPOLIS, Oct. 6.â The Jour
nal's Walker (Minn.) special says: The
tug Chief with 100 men and a Gatling
gun started for Bog-Ga-Wah-Ge-Shish
Point at 5 o'clock. The men are in a
bad temper and there will be trouble
on the mainland to-night.
The Indians at Leech Lake are being
reinforced by rÂ« s and Red Lake In
dians in large numbers. A general up
rising is certain. We need 1000 men.
APPEAL OF
THE EDITORS
Ask the President to
Send a Large Force
to Subdue the
Indians.
MINNEAPOLIS, Oct. 6â The
following telegram, which speaks
for Itself, was sent to President
McKinley last evening:
'â¢To William McKinley, Execu
tive Mansion, Washington: Ad
vices from conservative sources
lead us to believe that a force
of not less than 600 soldiers, pre
ferably 800, should be at once
available at Leech Lake and vi
cinity. We believe suclt a force
is needed, not only to rescue
General Bacon and the survivors
of his command, but properly to
overawe the agency Indians, in
whose professions of friendship
and neutrality no one acquainted
with them puts credence. A gen
eral outbreak at or around
Walker would probably result in
the massacre of many citizens.
In a county so heavily wooded
the present force is, in our judg
ment, w.ioily inadequate. The
gravity of the situation is not
overestimated in the above sug
gestions.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 6.â The War
Investigating Commission held two
sessions to-day. In the forenoon Gen
eral H. V. Boynton concluded his tes
timony, and General Fitzhugh Lee was
heard in the afternoon.
General Boynton dwelt upon the
causes of disease at Camp Thomas,
charging the increase toward the close
of the camp to the lack of sufficient
care on the part of the regimental and
brigade commanders in covering the
sinks.
General Lee detailed the conditions
prevailing at the camp at Jacksonville.
He said the site was a good one, the
supplies were plentiful, the men well
taken care of, and added that he had
no complaint to make of_the War De
partment's treatment of his command.
He also took occasion, in reply to a
question put by Captain Howell, to say
that he did not consider that he had
been slighted in the war. He wanted to
go to Havana, and the President had
recently told him that in case it had
been necessary to take Havana by as
sault he had intended to ask him (Gen
eral Lee) to lead the assaulting army.
Governor Beaver read a letter com
plaining of the situation in the Jack
sonville camp, The letter said the
camp was filthy, the bread moldy, the
doctors generally drunk, etc.
"Is that from my command?" Gen
eral Lee asked in evident surprise.
When informed that it was he said
he was astonished and asked for the
name of the author. He said in this
connection that occasional complaints
had come to him, which he examined,
and in every case found them to be un
founded.
"Then," said Governor Beaver, after
some further questioning, "you con
sider yourself in good condition in
every way to start on the expedition to
Cuba? 1 '
"I do," replied General Lee. "Touch
a button and we are prepared even to
go to Madrid."
Captain Howell asked General Lee If
he considered that he had been side
tracked in the campaign.
"I don't think so," replied General
Lee. "I have from time to time seen
something in the newspapers to the
effect that it was not the intention of
the authorities that I should have an
opportunity for active participation In
the campaign. I, of course, had no
claim to go to Santiago or Porto
Rico, aB other officers in the army
ranked me. It was always the under
standing that my corps was organized
for the Havana campaign. I had
some ambition to go there, because I
had not been allowed to stay while I
was there. T wanted to go back with
some men and show our enemies that I
could stay."
He continued by saying that the
President had told him within the past
few days that he had always intended
to send him to Havana, and that in
case there had been an assault on the
city that he should have led it.
He said in conclusion that he knew of
no cases of distress, starvation or
death from any neglect or that was
due to any inefficiency on the part of
the Government officials. He said he
had no complaint to make against the
War Department, and knew of none
of his command who had.
General Greene, who participated In
the Manila campaign, will be heard to
morrow.

Dunham visited Kan Francisquito

AGUINALDO IS A FIGUREHEAD

There Are 120 Spanish Prisoners at

' cah'.o to The Tall nnd the New Tork

MANILA. Oct. 6.â Artachlo, who was
a fellow leader with Agruinaldo in a
tfon, and brought suit
against Agruinaldo for half the money
which was paid by Spain to make
c, has been shm by order of the in
â¢-. It is d
ful whether Aguinaldo was a consent
ing: party to the execution.
I visited the dictator at Ma
yesterday. I have become convinced
that he is only a figurehead put for
ward by a kind of revolutionary trust
in which a Mestizo named Juan Pa
terno is the moving spirit. I desired to
visit Spanish prisoners at Belucan and
was told frankly by Paterno that even
Aguinaldo could not pive a pass with- â 
out the consent of the Secret Council,
six i! if which are not in the â 
dictator's cabinet. I went armed with
a letter from La garda, the insurgent !
Secretary of State. This letter had no
. tit whatever.
There are 12 h prisoners at
Belucan. They are literally starving.
There are also twenty-four priests who
are held lnc< Â»i spite the
fact that they are non-combatants.
The insurgent party is becoming more
I disorganized every day. Kn h petty
I chief is setting up a little government
i on his own account, and no one is pay
ing great attention to Aguinaldo's or
ders. The dictator looks and evidently
feels greatly worried over the condi
tions prevailing here, as well as with
the uncertainty attendant unon the re
sult of the meeting in Paris. Paterno
openly advocates independence.
There have been no new cases of
smallpox among the American troops
since Sunday. The disease is now well

Philippines.
SPANISH SIDE SQUIRMING
DOES NOT RELISH THE DEMAND
OF UNCLE SAM.
The Dons at Paris Will Not Consent

and Granting All In

Special cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1898, by James Gor
don Bennett.
PARIS, Oct. 6.â lt is pretty generally
believed i>.at the first battle of the
Peace Commission will be fought to
morrow.
Although the members themselves
confess perfect satisfaction with mat
is far as they have so far proe
ress< d, a certain amount of inquietude
is plainly discernible on the Spanish
side. This appears to be undoubtedly
due to the firmness of the Americans.
Report has it that the United States
intends to solve the Philippines diffi
culty by insisting upon the cession of
the whole island of Luzon and upon ab
solute independence of the rest of the
archipelago. This is said to have been
a hard blow for the Spanish commis
sioners. From the few details that have
leaked out, it seems that Spain hoped
to deal with the Philippines upon the
basis established in the protocolâ that
is the cession of Manila and one island
for a coaling station. Now as Manila
is the key to the Philippines, the archi
pelago would virtually be under the
â il of the power^olding itâ that is
to say the United Su.;es. Spain, there
fore, has no very keen desire to keep
the islands unlor such circumstances,
but at the same time it hoped to sell
them as dearly as possible.
However, this hup.- is being shattered
if it is true that America, while re
taining Luzon, the most Important Is
land in the group, will insist at the
time upon the entire independence
of the other islands. It is said the
Spanish commissioners have received
very definite instructions to refuse their
agreement to a cession of the island of
Luzon unless the United States will as
the entire Philippine debt. As to
the independence of the oth^r islands,
the commissioners are, it appears, to
refuse even to consider it.
;.-, â â¢ O ne source I heard yesterday
that the American delegates intend dis
g of the Philippine debt question
by the appointment of an arbitration

HIGH JINKS HELD BY
JUNIORS AT STANFORD
Dedication of "The Junior Plug."
Smallest Student as Chief
High Mogul.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Oct. 6.â
To-night was junior night at the univer
sity, and that class held full Bway. Near
ly the whole university had gathered .-it
the faculty athletic grounds to witness
the dedication of "The Junior Plug, ' as
It is calledâ "the orgy of the third-year
tile."
Little Frank Adams, the smallest man
in the university, was Chief High Mogul,
and around his altar gathered the priests
in hideous guise. The jibes, quips and
jokes were strong:, and spared neither
student nor faculty.
Alter the speeches occurred the event
of the evening. At a signal from the High
Chief Mosul the l>ig plug was carried
forward, and so large was It that it took
six strong men to bear it. in its trail
followed the humble worshipers of the
tile. Before the altar it was placed. The
priests had worked themselves to a state
bordering on frenzy, â â â¢â -Ming and falling
in fantastic figures, raising their hands
and crying aloud in their mental anguish.
The scene was ludicrous enough then to
keep the larg< audience on the roar, but
when the "frantic poet" came upon the
the strain was all but too great.
His voice was pitched to a treble and
ended In a shriek as he shouted:
"Yes, I do know where I am at, and I
am not talking through my hat."
"You're a liar!" came with a roar from
the interior of the big-bellied plug and to
the utter amazement of the many dear
ladies in the crowd.
THRILLING FEAT
AT IGABA FALLS
Three Young Men Risk
Their Lives.
RECOVER A SUICIDE'S BODY
EARN A REWARD OF A THOU
SAND DOLLARS.
Perilous Undertaking Watched by a
Breathless Crowd on Shore,
Who Cheered the
Exploit.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NIAGARA FALLS, N. V., Oct. 6.â
Fred Preston, his younger brother and
a man named Howard Blake has ac
complished one of the greatest feats of
daring in the history of the fulls, and
incidentally recovered the body of Peter
mm, the Philadelphia millionaire,
: who committed suicide by jumping over
the falls from G< at Island bridge on
September 13.
There was a reward of $1000 for the
body of Schemm, which was needed in
order to collect insurance. Young
Preston, since the reward was offered,
, has camped at -he great whirlpool
r.i -ht and day. With a spyglass he
has watched the floating wreck of
driftwood and dead animals which col
; lecte above the vortex every hour of
I the day.. At night, benumbed with cold
i but with the aid >>f gr^-at fires, he has
watched the swirling of the green
water.
This morning he saw something
which looked like a body. Preston,
who has rescued bodies before, did not
dare swim to the poolâ a feat which
he has often accomplished â on account
of the cold. He transported a boat
from Queenstown, and with his com
panions braved the terrible currents of
' the revolving circle of water. It was
1 soon in the middle where a few specta
tors on shore saw a huge black object
i shoot up from u:e gre-n water. It was
' a log held prisoner by the undertow,
! and being sudi enly released sought the
! surface and bumped the boat, but did
not strike it squarely.
Undaunted, the men rowed to the
very verge of the rapidly revolving
mass of drift which is collected over
the vortex. The body was caught in
the limbs of a tree, but the men dis
engaged it and securing it with a rope
started back to the shore. The crowd
cheered. They rowed powerfully and
soon were near the shore, the body of
Schemm towed behind.
It is undoubtedly the body of the mil
lionaire, who committed suicide because
his eyesight was failing him. Several
other bodies have been found, which
weir- thought to be Schemm's remains,
but Investigation showed they werp not.
Fillings in th^ teeth of the remains re
covered to-day make the identification
complete.

CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS
ARE DEFEATED.
Aguinaldo's Agent in This Country
Sends a Communication Ask
ing for Prayers for the
Filipinos.
Special Disiutch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 6. â Morning
prayer for tho delegates to the triennial
convention <.f the Episcopal <huroh was
held at the Chinch of the Epiphany, Rev.
Ijt. McKlm reading the service. Bishop
Gilbert of Minnesota pronounced the
benediction.
Rev. Dr. Morgan Dlx, the president,
called the second day's session of the
House of Deputies to order. Preliminary
routine business occupied an hour. A
number of standing committees were ap
pointed and resolutions and memorials on
deceased members were presented and re
ferred to appropriate committees. Rev.
Dr. Mann of Missouri offered a resolu
tion naming Kansas City, Mo., as the
next place of meeting of the convention.
From Indiana came a resolution express-
Ing the earnest desire of the convention
that the Instructions to the commission
era to be appointed to the International
Peace Conference proposed by the Czar
of Russia shall recommend the establish
ment of a permanent court for the settle
ment of differences by arbitration.
Several resolutions on the question of
marriage and divorce were presented. It
was moved that the discussion of these
questions by the convention be held be
hind closed doors, but some objection
was made to immediate consideration,
and the matter was referred to the cal
endar of business for the consideration
by a committee.
The following communication from
Felipe Agoncillo, the Philippine represen
tative in this country, was read:
To the Honorable and Very Reverend Pres
ident, members and Reverend Secretary Amer
ican Episcopal Church, as 'enabled in triennial
| convention in Washington: We rejoice with
you in the assemblage to-day of your general
convention, and, taking advantage of this sol
emn occasion, we believe it to be our duty
to convey to you our liiuh. consideration and
respect. The exalted American clergy cer
tainly represent Christian morals and holy
charity, virtues which elevate them in the
general esteem. In paying this tribute of ad
miration to the exalted ecclesiastical hierarchy
of North America 1 fulfill our purpose in sup
' pllcatlne you to offer y#ur prayers to the
Most Hit;h, on behalf of the natives of the
Philippine Islands, and In askinc you to do !
all tbat can be done to protect them in this
supreme moment of their history, and to as
sure them their liberty and protected person
ality, to which they are entitled by their
loyalty and their services to the American
cause.
The noble and humanitarian republic of the
United States of North America comes to
I! our work of political and social redemp- j
y. to which they are entitled by their |
ilty and their services to the American j
30. 1
ie noble and humanitarian republic of the
ted States of North America comes to
n our w.irk Of political and social redemp
tion. We are deeply thankrul for the union ;
and amity of the Filipinos and America. May j
they be Imperishable and bear the zeal of t
evangelic brotherhood,- which may be 1m
pressed upon it by the respected prelates as
bled.
The convention then proceeded to the
i consideration of the report on the re
i vision of the constitution.
} The amendments acted upon were those
t adopted by both houses of the general
' convention of 1595 and which require rati
i lication by the next subsequent conven
tion to become operative. The first of
these affected the question of a heading
or title for the constitution, canons, etc.,
of the church, and provided It should
pteil by both houses of the general
vention"of 1895 and which require rati
tion by the next subsequent conven
i to become operative. The first of
Re affected the Question of a heading
title for the constitution, canons, etc.,
:he church, and provided It should be
! as follows:
"Constitution and canons for the gov
1 ernment of that part of the catholic
: church known in America as the Pro
testant Episcopal church in the United
States of America."
The amendment made by the last con
vention incorporated in the title the fol
lowing words: "That portion of the
catholic church known in law as."
The change had few advocates, but
I many opponents, who asserted that the
i change made the title cumbersome and i
1 awkward, that it was unnecessary to de- I
clare that the Episcopalians were a part |
of the catholic church and that some wag :
: would soon nickname the Episcopalians I
the "in-law" church. The amendment
was defeated by los nays to 3 yeas.
The next amendment, which contem
plated the substitution of article "one"
for articles 1, 2 and 3 of the old con
stitution and which was adopted almost
unanimously by the last convention, was ;
also defeated by a vote of 92 to 17. Mean
time messages had been received from |
the House of Bishops that they had |
adopted both the amendments rejected
by the house, but in each case a motion
was made in the deputies that they re
fuse to concur in the action of the :
bishops and that body was so informed.
In the House of Bishops most of the
time was consumed in the action on the
amendments to the constitution already
referred to. A message of sympathy was
directed to be conveyed to Bishop Nllea
of New Hampshire, who is seriously ill.
Petitions were presented for the creation
of a new diocese in Indiana, and also for
the division of the Japanese district Into
two dioceses.
The afternoon session of the deputies
was consumed In consideration of an
amendment originating with the commit
tee on constitutional revision, which in
corporated In the constitution that provi
sion of the canonical law, which requires
that the selection of Bishops shall l>
sanctioned by a majority of the standing
committees In all dioceses of the church.
It gave rise to interminable dispute and
the deputies adjourned without acting on
it. Most of the speakers favored the
change.
It was announced that the Woman's
Auxiliary, also in convention here, had
reported a collection of $80,400 for mis
sions, about $25,000 more than for the pre
vious year. Adjournment was then taken
until to-morrow.
In the House of Bishops the delegates
commenced the consideration of the
amendments to the canons recommended j
by the committee. Those discussed to
day related mainly to ordination of Bish
ops. To-night the delegates attended a
reception given them by Bishop Satter
lee of Washington..
Notable among the lay delegates are
Chief Justice Fuller of the United States
Supreme Court, who represents the lay
delegation from Chicago; J. Pierpont Mor
gan. William Bayard Cutting, Francis
L.ynde Stetson and Captain A. T. Mahan,
representing New York: George C. Thom
as and James S. Biddle of Philadelphia,
The clergy was represented by many
prominent in the church work of the
country, including Rev. Morgan 1/ix of
New York. WKfÃm
At the session yesterday Bishop Whip
pie conducted the service and led the
opening prayers. Then followed the ser
vice of the Episcopal church. Bishop
Neely reading the epistle. Bishop Kilmer
the gospel, and all the Bishops uniting In
repeating the creed. Rev. Dr. McKlm of
the Church of the Epiphany made
the announcement of Dr. Williams'
absence, and that Bishop Whip
pie would preside over the assemblage of
Bishops until a presiding otficer was
chosen.
Bishop Tuttle of Missouri then ascended !
the pulpit and delivered the sermon. He
chose his text from Isaiah, llv:2: "En
large the place of thy tent and let them
stretch forth the curtain of thine habi- ;
tations; spare not, lengthen thy cords,
and strengthen thy stakes."
The House of Bishops organized yester
day by electing Bishop Doane of Albany
as presiding officer and re-electing Rev.
Samuel Hart, D.D., of Hartford, as sec
retary.

CHARLES L. PATTON'S CAMPAIGN
WHEN the Republican parly demanded that
Charles L. Patton become its candidate for
Mayor, the leaders of the organization were
certain they were making no mistake. Every pass
ing day emphasizes the soundness 01 their judgment.
Mr. Patton was not an aspirant. He accepted the
nomination at a sacrifice, but, having accepted it, he
brought into the fight the same qualities which have
carried him to success in business life. Honest,
energetic and enterprising, with no personal ambi
tion to gratify, no factions to appease, no desire to
be a dictator, he entered the struggle unhandicapped
to win on his merits alone. He is unpledged save to
the principles of the platform. He is untrammeled,
has no political record to explain away, no machine
made Committee of One Hundred through which to
operate. He stands before the people as ,::i indi
vidual, a representative citizen, only to find he has
even more friends than he had hoped.
There are circumstances aside from the inherent
merit of Patton's candidacy which, are throwing to it
an unexpected support. The fact is being impressed
upon voters that the present Mayor has cunningly
devised a system making him an unchecked boss, em
powered to select every name appearing on the ticket
with his own. It is known that the present Sc
Board, possibly the worst ever disgracing the city,
represents the personal choice of the Mayor; that the
Supervisor*, many of them rascals, most of them be
smirched with absolute scandal, were such as Phelan
desired to have in office as part of his local scheme of
government. The Widber theft, made possible
through the Mayor's unique scheme of "hefting"
coin, is to him painfully obtrusive just now as the
penitentiary doors seem about to swing to let Wid
ber in.
Then the non-compos-mentis-Partisans outfit has
aided Patton and the whole Republican ticket by first
showing itself to be a Phelan sideshow with no intent
beyond doing the Mayor's bidding, and then doing it.
Its ;>retensÂ£ is a mockery so palpable as to be laugh
able or irritating, according to the point of view.
From the first Patton has showed himself to have
a high sense of honor. He refused to accept the
nomination until the platforrrt had been made, his
opponent having accepted two nominations in the
absence of any platform. Mr. Patton stands for prin
ciple. Against him is one to whom office and power
have proved sweet, and who, having in the name of
reform created a remorseless machine, has in the
name of purity taken counsel of degenerate boodlers.
A? the Republican candidate moves among the peo
ple his popularity increases. His is an individuality
commanding respect. He is frank, affable, and yet
firm. He has in a large degree the quality of mag
reti^m. He has the advantage of a large frame In
mind, r>s in body, then- is nothing small about him.
Unless for something wholly unforeseen, Charles
L. Patton will be the next Mayor. He has only to
go forward in the manly way which has thus far
characterized his course, relying on ability, his free
dom from alliances, and certain that the mistakes of
Phelan and his adherents, too grave and too recent to
be overlooked, will be no inconsiderable aid.
The young man guilty of train -wrecking near
Santa Rosa is said to laugh at his crime. While his
exuberant sen^e of humor may be something to ad
mire, his attention is called to the fact that train
wrecking is a capital offense, and consideration of
this fact may serve to check his mirth.
Regardless of the decision of the Police Commis
sioners, it may be stated frankly that the policemen
accused of cowardice at the time of Lieutcnrwt
Burkes murder were not, at least, guilty of con
spicuous bravery then.
Alger is said to look upon Miles as a nonentity.
Possibly the mind of the Secretary goes back to the
troublous times of the Civil War, when certain gen
erals had occasion to look for him and couldn't see
a thing.
There is an old Latin saw, "In vino veritas."
Chaplain Mclntyrc of the Oregon came near to il
lustrating the truth of it. Only his stimulant to
truthfulness was brandy enforced by quinine.
Perhaps the Pillager Indians have not been treated
with that consideration naturally due the wards of
the nation. Even an Indian has rights, although this
theory is seldom acted upon.
Why should the "Non-Partisans" keep out of the
Democratic fold? There is room for them there, and
the painful necessity of being hypocrites would be
obviated.
Spanish papers are beginning to advocate the pol
icy of giving up the Philippines. There is nothing
more sensible than bowing gracefully to the inevit
able.
Turkey receives more ultimatums and pays less
attention to them than any other nation in the world.
She has ultimatums to burn
MAYOR PHELAN'S SIDESI-jOW.
THE Democratic sideshow which has been mas
querading for a month past under the name oi
the Non-Partisan party having completed its
ticket and adjourned without day, its work may now
be analyzed with a view to placing it properly beiore
the public. The Call lias charged that the Non-
I 'artisans have been bossed by Mayor Phelan and his
brother-in-law, Frank J. Sullivan, and that these
manipulators have succeeded in securing from Dea
con Fitch's marionettes practically an indorsement of
their entire ticket. Proof of this will be found in the
ticket itself. Here it is, the names of the Republicans
indorsed being in black type:
Mayor James D. Phelan
Auditor ASA R. WELLS
Sheriff Theodore F. Bonnet
Treasurer L J. TRUMAN
Tax Collector James N. Block
Assessor JOHN D. SIEBE

denstein, W. M. Cannon, VANDERLYNN
STOW, H. M. HOLBROOK, W. G. STAF
FORD, E. L. HEAD, P. A. BERGEROT,
J. M. THOMAS.
It will be noted that upon the main ticket
hut six Republican candidates have been in
dorsed, namely, Wells fur Auditor, Truman for
Treasurer, Drinkhouse for Public Administrator.
Siebe for Assessor, Hawkins fur Coroner and
Webster for Superintendent of School*. Ex
cept Siebe none of these officials control patron
age. The Auditor appoints four or rive clerks, the
Treasurer about the same number, while the Superin
tendent of Schools, Public Administrator and Cor
oner ar*e ciphers in the spoiis department of politics.
When it is considered that the indorsement of Siebe
was not according to programme, and that the Dem
ocratic j"l. hers among the Non-Partisans exerted
all their strength, not only to defeat him, but to take
him off the ticket after indorsement, it will be seen
that the original plans of Phelan and Sullivan con
templated scooping in the entire City Hall.
As it is, the Mayor and his brother-in-law have
secured the Sheriff, with ninety-five deputies; the
Tax Collector, with thirty; the County Clerk, with
eighty-five; the Superintendent of Streets, with six
teen and an army of inspectors; the Recorder, with
about thirty; the civil and criminal law departments,
with their retinue of lawyers, and nine Supervisors,
with the veto power and the vast amount of patron
age controlled by that body.
Is any further proof necessary to establish the fact
that the Non- Partisan "convention" was a Demo
cratic sideshow, and that its ticket has become a tail
to Mayor Phelan's kite? What excuse have the Re
publicans in this unholy alliance to offer for permit
ting the Mayor to pull their legs in this manner?
Take George L. Center, for illustration. What is he
going to get for attempting to deliver Republican
non-partisan votes to the office-seekers of Phelan's
machine? If his reward shall be commensurate with
his party treachery and the service he has rendered
Phelan in the Non-Partisan convention, he should,
in case the plot succeeds, get at least a dozen depu
ties at the City Hall.
SAVINGS BANKS OF THE WORLD.
ACCORDING to figures recently issued by the
Treasury Bureau of Statistics, the number of
savings bank depositors in the world reached
in 1897 the notable aggregate of 45,796,767. The
total deposits amounted to the colossal sum of
$6,604,546,473. or an average of $144 21. The state
ment shows what has been accomplished by the insti
tution of savings banks, and is an evidence of the
thrift that prevails among people where such banks
exist.
In all comparisons regarding wages and savings
the United States ought to be far in the lead of any
other nation. In no other civilized country is there
such a large body of intelligent and thrifty working
men, and among no other people is the rate of wages
so high. It will come, therefore, to many persons as
something of a surprise to learn that while the
amount of deposits in savings banks in the United
States is larger than that in any other land, the num
ber of depositors in some countries is far greater than
in this.
France heads the list in the number of savings
bank depositors. No less than 8.986.631 of her econ
omical and thrifty population have a monetary stake
in the savings banks. Great Britain and Ireland
come next with 7,969,826 depositors, and Prussia
comes third with 6.255,507. In the United States the
number of such depositors was 5.201,132.
While we are behind France, Great Britain and
Prussia in the number of persons who have availed
themselves of savings banks as a means of safe
guarding their earnings, we lead them all in the
amount of the sums deposited. In France the total
amount of deposits is $829,783,735: in the United
Kingdom $815,686,750: in Prussia $939,757,555. In
the United States the deposits reached the magnifi
cent sum of $ 1. 93Â°. 376-035-
The only explanation that can be offered for the
superiority of France, Great Britain and Prussia over
the United States in the number of savings bank de
positors is that in those countries the postal bank
system has placed such banks within reach of nearly
the whole population. But a very small and insigni
ficant fraction of the people live beyond easy access
to a savings bank. In the United States, however,
where postal banks are unknown, a considerable pro
portion of the people have no savings bank facilities
within their reach.
It is to be hoped that this lr.ck in our banking sys
tem will soon be made up. The postal banks, which
have been so successful in Europe, would be equally
successful here, and are more needed here than in
TnE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 7, 1898.
any other country for the reason that so large a part
of the South and West is too thinly populated to ad
mit of the operation of ordinary savings banks. With
such a system maintained by the Government we
would soon lead the world in the number of savings
bank depositors as well as in the aggregate amount
of deposits.
TME ALL-COMPREh|ErSDiNG ISSUE.
NUMEROUS as are the questions, State and Na
tional, which are presented to the voters of
California in this campaign, ali of them are
comprehended in the single one of preserving pros
perity by the continuance of conservative govern
ment. The fused factions threaten the State with the
single tax and a large variety of socialistic experi
ments, and menace the nation with free trade, fiat
money and a general policy of industrial and finan
cial disturbance.
We have recently passed through a most disastrous
experience with Democratic management of national
affairs. We have learned what a Democratic tariff
means for American workingmen, and what is the
result of a threat to depreciate the value of our cur
rency. Even, therefore, if the country were not con
fronted by new problems, there would be sufficient
cause why all intelligent, industrious and thrifty citi
zens should vote for the party which has brought or
der out of disorder, and replaced hard times by pros
perity. We have had enough and more than enough
in the way of political disturbances of business af
fairs, and it is time now to maintain something of
stability.
Hardly ever before in our history was so much
legislation for the general good accomplished in so
short a time as that which has been achieved by the
present administration. When it came into office it
found the national treasury at its lowest ebb, the debt
of the country increased by bond issues in a time of
peace, the manufacturing industries almost at a stand
still, commerce depressed, the financial system un
certain, and all classes of people oppressed with the
ill effects of the Democratic panic.
Already the administration has overcome these
evils. It has restored protection and revived industry
and commerce. It has provided profits for capital
and wages for workingmen. It has carried on a war
fur the welfare of humanity and added to the glory
of American arms. It has outlined and developed a
noble policy both at home and abroad, and has in
every respect upheld a genuine Americanism.
Out of what has been accomplished there have
arisen new issues. Our protected industries have
reached a point where a larger merchant marine is
needed to carry their products to foreign markets.
The establishment of the basis of value of our money
upon the gold standard has opened the way for cur
rency reform and the reorganization of our paper
money system. Out of the war have come many is
sues of foreign policy. It would be folly to leave the
settlement of these questions to a party without a
policy and without leaders capable of formulating
one.
The all-comprehending issue of the time is the
preservation of prosperity, the maintenance of the
existing order of things. It is the duty of the people
to uphold the administration of McKinley and to
have a State government in harmony with the Na
tional Government. "Our country as it is" is a good
enough platform for any man to vote for in this cam
paign.
JUDGING from the comments of the New-
York press, popular interest in the recent Dem
ocratic State Convention at Syracuse was due
almost wholly to the evidence it gave ot the relative
importance in the party of the rival chieftains, lliil
and Croker. No one expects the ticket to win, but
every one is studying it to see whether it is a Hill
ticket or a Croker ticket.
It is conceded that the nominee for Governor,
Judge Van VVyck, is Croker' s man, and that Hill op
posed the nomination as long as he could. On the
other hand, it is asserted that in order to obtain the
head of the ticket Croker had to surrender to Hill
very nearly everything else, and it is staled that, with
the exception of the candidate lor State Engineer,
who is the property, as it were, of Senator Murphy,
all the rest of the ticket is Hill's. It appears, more
over, that at the wind up of the convention Hill man
aged to get a majority of the State Committee, and
thus has control of the party machinery.
On this showing there exists a wide difference of
opinion as to which boss carried off the larger share
of the spoils. It is claimed by some that in getting
the nomination for Governor Croker obtained the
oyster and left Hill the shell; but others maintain
it was a Hill convention throughout, and that the
head of the ticket was given to the Tammany man
simply because Hill knew no Democrat can be elected
Governor of New York this year, and therefore he
was not eager to put up one of his friends for the
place.
From this distance it appears the latter view of the
situation is correct. Undoubtedly if Van Wyck should
be elected Croker will have the better part of the bar
gain. With one of his supporters holding the ofiice
of Mayor of New York City and another as Governor
of tRe State, the Tammany boss could run things
very much in his own way. and Hill's friends at the
head of the Democratic machine would have to stand
in and be thankful for small patronage If, however,
Van Wyck should be defeated Croker will have noth
ing, and Hill will be in a position to use the machin
ery of the party for his own advantage in iooo.
It is not at all improbable that Hill is much more
concerned about the campaign of 1000 than about the
present one. He might profitably have conceded to
Tammany the whole State ticket this year in ex
change for the .State Committee and control of the
party machinery. Bryanism is a rapidly fading issue,
and with a sweeping Republican victory this fall it
will cease to be a potent factor in our politics. Dem
ocracy will then have to look for a new leader in the
Presidential fight. If Hill has control of New York
at that time his position will be sufficiently elevated
to attract Presidential lightning about convention
time, and it was. perhaps, that consideration which
led him to avoid a finish fight with Croker this year.
If the steps being taken to make Corbett and Mc-
Coy fight could be directed toward making them
hold their respective jaws, a wave of gratitude would
sweep from sea to sea.
There is no need for worry over the report that
Spanish troops are to be sent to the Philippines.
Spain might as sensibly plan to send a few regiments
to Washington.
It is a wonder Chief Lees did not ship Mrs. Botkin
to Delaware without bothering the Governor about
it, since he intimates that he intends to do so ?ooner
or later.
It will do no harm to inspect with Â«i somewhat
critical eye the Chinese bureau supposed to operate in
this city. The mechanism of it seems to be out
of gear.

DE YOUNG'S
CANDIDACY
From the Oakland Enquirer.
The Enquirer is not among those
newspapers which have been consum
ing a large amount of space with spec
ulations and warnings concerning the
candidacy for the United States Senate
of M. H. de Young, although it does
not favor such candidacy. It recog
nizes that there is some force in what
the San Francisco Post said in a recent
article, in which it argued that in the
event of Republicans having a major
ity in the Legislature the candidacy of
De Young will have been helped by the
reiteration of his name by the Demo
cratic papers. If the election of De
Young as United States Senator is not
desired, it is not advisable to keep
talking about him all the time and giv
ing him a prominence which he does
not deserve.
And yet there is a time for all
things, and if De Young is not a topic
for breakfast, dinner and supper,
neither should he be altogether ignored.
One extreme may be as bad us another.
It the Republicans elect the Legisla
ture, as we hope they may, and if Do
Young appears as a candidate, there
will go up a shout of disapproval, and
those members of the Legislature who
thi ii declare either for or against De
Young will be accused of deception if
they have kept entirely silent during
the campaign. All the pro-Dc Young
men will be accused of having obtained
votes under false pretenses, and those
who declare against him will be likely
to have their sincerity doubted unless
they make their position manifest be
fore election.
Mr. de Young has declared that he is
making no light for the Senatorship,
and we are disposed to accord to him
credit for sincerity in that utterance.
Hut he has not said he will not become
v candidate, and It is pretty well un
derstood that In the event of the elec
tion of a majority of Republicans to
the Legislature he will become a very
active candidate and will have some
powerful influences backing him. It is
impossible to ignore this; It would be
foolish, merely for the sake i f keeping
peace In the Republican family for the
time being, ti, pursue a course which
would be likely to create so large a
store of serious trouble a little fur
ther on.
Among the Republican candidates
for the Legislature in Alameda County
there ar" several who have stated
frankly in private conversation that
they are not for De Young, and we
think they ought to make the same
declaration in public. It would set
thÂ«Â»m right before their constituents,
who do not approve of the Senatorial
candidacy of Mr. de Young 1 and would
increase their chances of election. And
if there are any Senatorial or Assem
bly candidates who favor De Young
they should say so, because they can
not afford to be elected under a mis
understanding and be accused after
ward of treachery. In short, this Is a
time when plain speaking on th~ j sub
ject of the Senatorship would be very
much in order.

WASH LEATHER. N., Hay wards. Cal.
A method for cleaning wash or polishing
leather (chamois) is as follows: Wash in a
weak solution of soda and warm water,
then rub in a good deal of soap in the
leather and let it soften for two hours.
After that wash until perfectly clean
and rinse in a weak solution of warm
water, soda and yellow soap. It should
not be washed in cold water, as it will
become so hard that it cannot be used
again. It is the small quantity of soap
remaining in the leather which permeates
its smallest particles and makes the
leather as soft as silk. After the rinsing
the leather is wrung out in a coarse
towel and dried quickly. It is then
pulled in every direction and well
brushed, after which it is softer and bet
ter than most wash leather when rirst
bought If rough leather is used to finish
highly polished surfaces It will often be
observed that the surface is scratched or
injured. This is caused by particles of
dust or even grains of hard rouge that
were left in the leather. As soon as these
are removed with a clean brush and
rouge a perfectly bright and beautiful
finish can be obtained.

Hal Hoffman Predicts That by

BY HAL HOFFMAN.
Ppecial Correspondence of The Call.
JUNEAU. Alaska, Sept. 28.â A new
strike in the Atlin Lake region shows
that district !<â  be the equal of the
Klondike in placer gold deposits, If the
i future shall show th>' news to be sup
', ported by facts. Among the latest to
arrive out from the new diggings are
J. T. Jones and C. L. Parish of Juneau.
i The general character of the news so
! far since the first reports indicates that
Juneau will be nearly depopulated next
spring by the exodus to the new camp.
Further exploration in the Lake At
lin region has resulted in the discov
ery of a live volcano, the existence of
which was not even heretofore sus
â¢l. The volcano, though thorough
ly alive, Is not very active. It shows
serve force than vigor. It is
ely noticeable in the day, as a
rule, but in the night against the back
ground of the sky a flare of flames can
be seen at the summit and puffs of
smoke ascending at irregular intervals.
An Indian of the Lake Teslin country,
a Thinklit, said that the eruption is
recent, and he regarded it as a fore
runner of evil. The cone of the vol
cano is only about ten miles from Sur
prise Lake, in an easterly direction. It
is on the summit of a chain of moun
tains extending between Lakes Atlin
and Teslin, and it is nearer, apparent
ly, to Teslin than to Atlin. The west
ern slope of these mountains drains
Into Lake Atlin. The two men who
made the rich gold strike told about
by Messrs. Jnnes and Parish discov
ered the volcano. They passed to the
east of it.
There is a vast country around the
new diggings, and particularly to th*
north, that has not only not been pros- ''
pected but has never been explored.
Even the Indians know litiie or noth
ing about it; they prefer to remain in
the more open country around the lakes ,
to the eastward.
Old miners out from the new diggings i
anticipate that more men will be em
â¢;. next August than in
Dawson. The ground lays so as to fa
cilitate working, and fair pro
have so far been found on nearly all
the creeks. They also predict the
finding of s< ... â  g ! [alms In the un
prospected region north and east.
There will doubtless be considi rable
travel in and out of the new diggings I
all winter owing to their proximity to
the coast. They are only about 100 ;
miles distant.

In the Artie circle for some tlm<\
arrived here to-day from St. Michael,
having accomplished an unprecedented
journey full of p^ri! and privations. Jones
left Oklahoma Territory seventeen months
ago fur Great Slave Lake, and the mouth
or the Mackenzie River, with the object
of bringing out to civilization a herd of
live musk oxer.. He went in over the
Edmonton route, reaching Great Slave
I^ake last July, after a long and perilous
trip.
About two months ago, in company with
Albert Rea of Alberta, he started on his
homeward journey, coming up the Peel
and Rat rivers, across the Portage to
Mi Hat River, and down the West
lit and Porcupine to the Yukon. He
was thirty-three days from Great Slave
Lake to Fort Yukon.
Jones says there are 2000 people who;
started over the Edmonton route in the
summer of 1897, frozen in at Destruction
City, located at the junction of the Peel
and Rat rivers. They will not reach civ- j
Ilization before next July. They are well
supplied with provisions. The winter will \
be spent In constructing' boats. Among !
those at Destruction I'ity are Mr. and
A. C. Craig and a Mr. Thumser, all

Acountlng for his failure to bring- out
any musk ox^n, Jones said he caupht

throats of his animals. Jones brought out
a large amount of letters from Destruc

DR. SANDEN'S ELECTRIC BELT.
There Is nothing so penetrating, nothing so invigorating nothing that will relieve weakness and pain as speed-
ily and surely as Dr. Sanden'sEelectric Belt. It is simple, but grand. It assists nature by a general reinforcement of
the vital energy, by infusing a mild, invigorating current of electricity into the nerves and by supplying the sys-
tem with the very essence â¢>( nerve vigor and nerve strength. Dr. Sanden applies his belt in a manner taught him
by years of successful practice. Electricity applied properly is a grand remedy for all weakness. If you have
Rheumatism, Lame Back, Sciatica, Lumbago or weakness in the nerves or vital organs, you ought to consult Dr.
Sanden. He will tell you whether his belt will cure you and give you his advice free. Call and test the powerful
current this wonderful belt gives, and see how easily it is regulated. Don't be ignorant of a remedy which may
correct all your past mistakes and assure your future happiness. If you cannot call, send for Dr. Sanden's famous
book, "Three Classes of Men," devoted to the weakness of men; tells the cause of early decay in young and mid-
dle-aged men. It shows how electricity properly applied will restore this power, and gives the proof. Send for It
to-day. It is free. A call preferred. Call or address

LI ISSUES
CLEVERLY EVADED
Maguire Opposed to War
Revenue.
RAILROADS AND MONOPOLIES
CHANGED RUNG ON THESE DEAD
ISSUES.
Used as a Pretext for Attacking His
Political Adversary, Henry
T. Gage, and His
Supporters.
REDWOOD, Cal., Oct. 6.â James G.
Maguire addressed an audience of
about 800 this evening at the Alhambra
Theater. His address lasted nearly two
hours and a half. Maguire's arrival
was a quiet affair. He came on the 6:30
p. m. train and was met at the station
by the reception committee, composed
of George H. Buck, C. J. Hynding, Dr.
Barret, L. J. Frank, J. R. Walker and
W. D. Crowe.
From the station Maguire was escort
ed to the Capitol Hotel, where the en
tire party partook of an elegant repast,
set for their especial benefit. At 7:30
p. m. music and the ring of anvils filled
the air and a bonfire burned along the
main streets. At 8 o'clock Maguire made
his appearance before the waiting au
dience.
Judge G. H. Buck made a short open
ing speech and then introduced James
G. Maguire. Maguire, as he stepped to
the front of the stage, received an ova
tion that lasted several minutes. He
opened his address by saying the Issues
of this campaign were important, as it
was a fight between the moneyed people
and monopolies and the worklngman.
He dwelt for some time on the mo
nopolies of the United States, and also
explained the workings of the Silver
Republican party. Continuing he said:
In discussing the issues of this cam
paign I take them up as they were adopt
ed at the Democratic convention; the lie
publicans evade the Issues as they art
laid down by their platform. I stand
ready to discuss any Issue of this cam
paign with any of my adversaries. About
three weeks ago my distinguished oppo
nent made his keynote speech at Los An
geles. It was found that this speech was
not the right keynote. A new speech was
then made, not by my opponent, but by
the great Southern Pacitic lawyer, Gen
eral W. H. L. Barnes.
General Barnes claims that the war
with Spain was a Republican war. I deny
it, it was an American war and was
fought by Democrats, Republicans, Popu
lists and all other parties, so I do not Bee
how that question can elect the Republi
can ticket In this State, as General Barnes
says it should. There is no premium upon
the loyalty of any party. I do not wish
to detract from the loyalty of my Repub
lican friends, but I believe the Democrats
were as. loyal in the Spanish-American
war as the Republicans. Let no party
claim the glory of the war as there was
an everlasting shame connected with the
late war and they that claim the glory
must bear the burden of the shame.
Maguire took up the late war and
dwelt for sometime upon the war tax,
and tried to show that the Democrats
had nothing to do with the present war
tax, which was a burden upon the
working class.
General Barnes, he declared, devoted
three columns of his speech to the
South Sea Islands, saying that the
question should be left open, as no man
was in a position to determine the ques
tion. General Barries, he said, also
claimed that the Pacific Railroad ques
tion is settled. The Little Giant then
went on to explain the matter. He at
tacked General Barnes and Henry T.
Gage throughout his explanation. He
took up the funding bill and harped
upon It so long that he had no time to
take up the main issue the State tick
et. He also repeated his speech of last
night by saying that the Republican
ticket might have been drawn up by the
Southern Pacific attorney, W. P. Her
rin. The remainder of his speech was
a repetition of his San Rafael address.
Hutchison, the Democratic nominee for
Lieutenant Governor, also addressed
the meeting^

FOR ASSEMBLYMAN.
Robert Grasham Beats Bonneau for
Clerk â Supervisor Taylor for
Sheriff and Barstow for
Treasurer.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, Oct. 6.â The Marin
County Republican convention has
been relegated to the historical page.
When the convention was called to
order in the Superior Court room of the
Courthouse there were present eighty
three delegates, representing the pre
cincts of San Rafael, Sausalito, Rich
ardson, Las Gallinas, San Quentin, Sun
Anselmo, Mill Valley, Boltnas, Tomales,
Black, Larkspur, Olema, Tiburon, No
vato, San Antonio, Nicasio, Point
Reyes, Marshall and Belvedere.
William Barr called the convention
| to order and General Dickinson was se
i lected as temporary chairman by ac
j clarnation. J. Fottrell, J. H. Pryor and
; Fred Linsley were elected secretaries
in the same manner.
Committees -were appointed as fol
lows:
Credentialsâ W. S. Dreypolcher, W.
Davis, George E. Ring, C. H. Becker and
L. Bonnettl.
Permanent organization and order of
business â W. F. C. Eiasson, William Van
derbilt, P. J. Sartorl, A. Martinelli and J.
Bonner.
Platformâ Henry Knittel. F. G. Water
house. Daniel E. Hayes, P. H. O'Brien
and Edward Bean.
The committee on platform brought
in a report indorsing the Republican
National and State platforms and rec
ommending that the Marin County
roads be made the best, in the State.
For Assemblyman four names were
presentedâ J. W. Atherton, T. V.
O'Brien, Orton Hubbell and Charles I.
â  Heverin. Hubbell withdrew, and the
first ballot resulted in 51 votes for
i Atherton, 10 for O'Brien and 22 for
Heverin. The result was greeted with
cheers and "throwdown" number one
i for the De Young forces.
For Sheriff and Tax Collector three
names were presented â William Barr
(chairman of the Board of Supervis
ors), William Taylor and Thomas
i Nichols. Taylor won the nomination
j by a vote of 51, Barr 19 and Nichols 12.
Long continued applause greeted the
result, and Mr. Barr was the first to
congratulate the winner.
Thomas Bonneau, the incumbent,
was then put forward as a candidate
for the nomination of County Clerk,
| his sole opponent being Robert
Graham, the popular conductor of the
narrow-gauge railroad. Graham won
with 44 votes. Bonneau received 39.
S. F. Baxstow was nominated for
' Treasurer by acclamation, no oppo
,/ietit caring to break a lance with the
bid warhorse.
For District Attorney E. B. Marti
nelli and T. P. Boyd were the only can
i didates. Martinelli received 48 votes to
I Boyd's 35. a good piece of "machine
! work" changing the outlook at the last
j moment.
: The candidates for Auditor were H. F.
j Taft, W. F. Dougherty, F. S. Holland,
! George F. Ryan. W. H. Vaughan, W.
H. Devalin and Matthew Canavan.
Five ballots were taken, and it was
only after the withdrawal of five
names that Taft triumphed by a
large majority. Ira L. Parks Cfor As
j sessor), Robert Furlong (for Superin-
I tendent of Schools), and George L.
: Richardson (for Surveyor) were nomi
j nated by acclamation. Edward Eden
| was nominated for Coroner. He re
ceived sixty-eight votes to Dr. J. K.
Frink's twelve, owing partly to a scur
rilous attack made by circulating cards
| printed by the notorious T. H. Rush.
At (5 p. m. a recess was taken for an
hour and a half, and on reconvening D.
L. Hayden was elected as nominee for
Supervisor from the Fifth District and
Will Barr from the First. George Rod
den beat E. Gardner by one vote for
Justice of the Peace of San Rafael
Township. George Agnew and John
Gannon were elected as nominees for
constable. J. H. Pryor was elected
chairman of the county committee.
The convention adjourned about 9
o'clock with three cheers for the suc
cess of the Republican party.

Czar's peace union and the Anglo-
American alliancs in next Sunday's

THE NATIONAL SITUATION.
Condition of the Markets From a Wall-Street
Standpoint.
The circular of Henry Clews, under date of
New York. October 1, says: "Prices on the
Stock Exchange have undergone a reaction, the
end of which is difficult to determine. There
have been good reasons for the present decline.
The buying power of the public had been ex
hausted, and peace having been amply dis
counted, some new stimulus was necessary for
continuance of the uDward movement. The
big holders of stocks have materially lessened
their holdings, and are therefore quite willing
to see a lower range of values on which to
base a fresh advance. At the same time the
public are stubborn bulls and refuse to sell
while railroad and business prospects continue
encouraging. Yet. temporary conditions penult
demonstrations on the bear side .if thÂ« market,
and so long as the leaders >>n the bull side.
hold aloof, they are likely to meet with mure
or les* success. We do not attach much im
portance to the political situation. Just now
speculators are putting unfavorable construc
tions upon the drift of politics, mainly to suit !
their own ends. It is to their advantage to
frighten timid holders of stocks. The vital
point of the next election, however, will be the
sound money vote, and there Is happily no i
prospect of its diminution. On the contrary, I
It is probable that the next Congress will show .
both brancr.es of the Legislature to be on the
Bide of sound money: and the annual political ;
scare on this issue is likely to be of much less j
consequence than ufual.
'â¢Perhaps the most unfavorable factor In the
outlook Is the price of wheat, 78 cents for Sep
tember contracts in New York against 95 cents
a year ago. Farmers are in consequence hold
ing back supplies to the detriment of railroad
tarnings. This, however, is only a temporary |
element, as wheat must come forward later in |
large quantities to meet foreign demands, ana I
if at improved prices so much the better for the
West at large. A good deal of comment is also j
heard about cotton having touched the lowest j
price on record. Owing to the reduced cost of |
production In the new districts, which now j
grow a large proportion of the crop, this Is not |
bo serious a matter as appears, In some dis- j
tricts the excessively low price will be severely |
felt hut the Increasing diversification of Indus- :
try in the South Is proving an "set, and in I
the newer regions the large crop means fair i
prosperity. Cotton growing le conducted on
such peculiar economic conditions that large
cr pa and low prices do not always mean the |
came effects as in the caise of other crops.
"Briefly, we have in the side of lower prices |
exaggerated political uncertainties, a back- j
ward grain movement anl correspondingly dl- :
mlnish.vi railroad earnings. t< gather with the i
fact that the market leaders encouraged by th* :
break in the Industrials are working for lower
prices. On the side of higher prices wo have
an assurance of improve! political conditions
end an era of steady business prosperity. In
the long run the latter Influences will assert
themselves. For the present, however, they i
are temporarily overruled by the first named ,
conditions, leaving the situation favorable
chiefly to quick returns."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NF.W TORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. Oct. 6.â lnfluences governing l
the Ftock market to-day were largely confined
to developments in the specialties. The status
of the var in the tuig-ar trade was momentarily |
lost s'.prht of owing to consistent support to !
the stock. A further reduction in refined was j
a signal for a raid, hut after effecting a break j
of a point the stock rallied strongly and event- i
ually ruled a point above yesterday's closing j
price. Subsequent weakness robbed It of practi- j
cally all the gain and continued heaviness else
where. Pool buying was evident during the j
course of the day. and this fuctor in addition j
to moderate outside purchases, embracing a
largo pprlnkling of the Inactive stocks occa-
Blonally sustained prices, although the general
run of stocks favored a I'jwm level. Liquida- j
tion was very pronounced in Northern Pacific ;
common. I'nlon' Pacific. Denver and Gulf, Lor- j
aln preferred and Tobacco. The latter broke i
4%. but rebounded frequently, and cli Bed a
point above the lowest. President Duke was :
quoted as refusing to deny or confirm the cur
rent rumors regarding the negotiations with
Western plants. Dullness became quite pro
nounced during the afternoon and but a few
changes of note occurred, except where special I
considerations operated. Operations by the '
arbitrage interests were on both sides, early
purchases being thrown over when the reac- !
nary tendency became marKed. Reports of !
railway earnings from the less important lines !
â which averaged well, coupled with encouraging â¢
statements from influential officials regarding |
the outlook for general business and the an
nouncement of the appointment of the arbltra- '
tlon committee to settle the long standing fight |
â¢between the Canadian Pacific and the Ameri
can trans-continental lines regarding the ques
tion of differentials between Atlantic and Pacl
"c Coast points, did not arouse much enthusi- :

\" MARKET.
NEW YORK, Oct. The Eveninr Post's
i financial cablegram says: The stock markets
here were quiet to-day. They opened flat on
developments regarding Fashoda and closed
generally at about the lowest. Not the least
important factor is the financial situation In
Germany, to which special reference was made
In these dispatches on the 23d of September.
Berlin has been speculating in Industrial se
; curities In ail parts of the world, In addition
| to American shares anil there Is some danger of
an overstrain. Hankers here are beginning to
throw out a certain class of German bills,
drawn on German uses with only foreign
agencies here. I learn that large amounts were
lent to-day to Germany for three months at
44 1 * per cent. To-day's further rise of 1-16 per
1 cent In London discounts Is due to this Ger
man position.
A rise In the discount rate of the Bank of
Germany is looked for by Monday next, but it
is not certain. Americans were dull, closing
at the lowest. Spanish fours. Portuguese se
curities and mines were all depressed on Paris
selling. Grand Trunk was lower on realiza
tions. Console were flat on Faehoda.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Oct. 6.â Opening prices for wheat
showed a slight decline from yesterday, De
cember starting at 62%@62Hc. Though the early
news was somewhat bullish in tone. It was evi
dent that shorts had pretty well covered their
lines yesterday, for the market showed no re
sponsiveness, and on the contrary showed weak
ness for some time after the opening. In haif
an hour December had been sold down to â¬2%
QC2%c. under rather free general selling. Liv
erpool was %d higher. Northwestern receipts
were considerably smaller than of late. New
York reported foreigners good bidders for
spring wheat for shipment. After the first
selling (lurry was over the market became ex
cessively dull, and prices kept within a narrow
range for some time, though a gradual im
provement in tone was noticeable. Outside
markets were all stronger than this, Minnesota
and Duluth going especially strong for cash
wheat. Foreign markets also showed strength,
due to the dry weather in England and on the
Continent. The market reached Its highest
point shortly before the close, December get
ting up to 62%:&'02V, closing at G2%@62%c. a
shade advance over yesterday-.
Corn was slow all day with prices Inclined
to droop. , Cables were not so strong as ex
pected. December closed with a decline of Vie.
The market for oats was very quiet, with
prices a little lower, mainly in sympathy with
corn. May closed a shade lower at 2274 c.
Little was done In provisions. The market
early was weak but later in the day good buy
ing advanced prices. They closed with a gain
of Â£Â®5%c on the day.

THE RAISIN MARKET.
NEW YORK. Oct. 6.â The Journal of Com
merce says: While in some quarters there Is
still a fueling- of uncertainty as to the ability
of the California Raisin Growers' Association
to carry out Its prop Bed programme for the
regulation of market values during the cur
rent season the recent announcement of the
directors of that body has had the effect of
causing a better feeling, and more confidence
is felt In the ability of the organization to
carry out its plans for the betterment of the
raisin Industry. The extension of the time for
making deliveries to October IS relieves the
situation, as it will admit of the confirmation
of a number of orders th.it could not have
been filled so as to come under the original
time limit. There Is a more confident feeling
here In the ability of the association to control
the market, but at the same time buyers â  (.>
pear to be cautious and seem to be In no hurry
to place orders for forward shipment*. The
assertion that "No rain damaged raisins will
be packed as standard goods" and that "such
as have been rained on. but are not seriously
injured will be packed as ungraded loose mus
catels," seems to give general satisfaction, as
it had been feared that an effort would be
made to market these goods as prime.

HALF OFTHE
RAFT REACHES
PORT AT LAST
It Was Towed In by
the Tug Monarch.
DELAY OF THE ALAMEDA
MUCH MAIL MATTER WAS SIDE
TRACKED AT OGD_-N.
A Tire Drill in the Ferry Depot
Showed the Employes of the
Harbor Commission to
Be Efficient,
The tug Monarch got in from Pig-eon
Point yesterday with half of the Pro
gresos lop raft and the wrecking schoon
er Catalina to tow. There was no trouble
In getting the raft away from its anchor
age, and favored by wind and tide the
towboat did not take long to reach San
Francisco. The Monarch was sent out by
the Shipowners' and Merchants' Towboat
Company, and to It will belong all the
profit. T. P. H. Whltelaw. who went out
with the Catallna, was engaged at bo
much per day, so the salvage will be di
vided between the owners and crew of the
tug.
The Mail steamer Alameda did not get
away for Honolulu, Apia, Auckland and
Sydney until 10 o'clock last "night. Owing
to a blunder made at Ogden by the rail
way mail service twenty-five pouches
of Australian mail matter were sidetrack
ed and had to be sent on behind a special
engine. All the other English mail was
aboard and the 6teamer could easily have
got away at 2 p. m. had It not been for
the unfortunate mistake. The steamer is
thirty-two hours behind time, as she was
originally delayed twenty-four hours by
the non-arrival of the mall steamer at
New York on time.
The Harbor Commissioners gave their
employes in the new ferry depot an Im
promptu flre drill yesterday. Assistant
Chief Dougherty and Captain Comstock
met CommisHioners Colnon, Harney and
Herrold, and a false alarm was turned
In. The lanitors and t-mployes of the
building, beaded by the superintendent,
responded promptly, and In short order
the hose was unreeled, the pump at work
and a stream that carried from the build
ing clear to the end of the pier was soon
pouring out of one of the windows. This
was with water pumped from the bay,
and Chief Dougherty was more than
pleased with the showing. When it came
to using Spring Valley Water, however,
the pressure was found to be totally inad
equate and the board will pee to it that
the mistake i 3 rectified at once. Assist
ant Chief Dougherty recommended that
some extra hydrants on the piers, a few
more reels of hose for the building- and
BomÂ« axes be added to the outfit, and
the depot would be in perfect con
dition to flgln a fire The Harbor Com
misioners have already ordered the extra
appliances. , __

Church, and in the evening a good dinner
has been given all gratis, as the result
of the generosity of the ladies of the
church. A committee composed of Miss
Clara Reed. Mrs. Louise Hagman, Mrs.
K. M. Haydon, Miss Mary Talbott and
Mrs. William Jess undertook the task of
entertaining and feeding the delegates
and they have been accorded all manner
of votes of thanks. Another committee
consisting of Mrs. Thomas Dermott, Mrs.
J. K. Small man and Captain H. P. Walte
arranged for the locating of delegates in
different homes, and altogether the Bap
tist Association thinks Oakland a first
class entertainer.
Rev. Robert AVhittaker also did some
criticizing this morning before the Bap
tist Association, in which he stated that
"Oakland is a hard city tti which to make
conversions. It is hard because it is a
city of fads. Especially is the resident
part a difficult place in which to work
for the people have been preached to and
j preached to and preached to until they
are settled in their ideas."
On the whole there is much encourage
ment in church work, although the re
ports showed a dark side, for while 15S
I people were baptized last year, only nine
| ty-eight were reported this year.
Still later, in a very interesting report
of church work. Mr.' Whittaker said:
"Conversions must come if we will work
I and wait in faith; even here in Oakland
j conversions can be made."
She Couldn't Eat Realty.
OAKLAND, uct. 6.â Polk-o Judge Allen
this morning dismissal the charge of
failure to provide fur a minor child pre
ferred against W. "\\ . Moore- Jr. by his
mother. Moore's wife died some time ago,
and Moore's mothtT was appointed guar
dian of the child: but when Moore failed
to contribute toward the support of the
child the mother caused his arrest, since
she claims to be a very poor woman. On
the witness stand to-day she admitted
she owned property in San Francisco.
"But." said phe. "I can't eat the prop
erty." Subsequently it developed that
she also had money out at interest, and
Judge Allen decided that ft was a case
to be determined by civil action.

under a bench in Jackson Park. Being
searched at the City Prison it was found
that Fiachmeyer was armed with a long
knife, a hammer and a pair of pliers,
while Korb had a pistol anil several mar
tilt s. The trend of their conversation led
the officer to suspect that they had been
reading yellow-back uime novels of the
robber variety, and they were looking
tor wo-alth. but their ardor had been
dampened by the light showers of the
night. The boys will be turned over to
their parents when called for.

BOTKIN POISONING CASE.
. High State Officials Put Their Heads
Together and Think.
There was a long conference yesterday
I afternoon â¢in the office of the Attorney
1 GeiÂ«Â»r a i between Mr. FttXfemld and Gov
ernor Budd upon the Botkin extradition
case. The two officials then repaired to
the chambers of Supreme Justice Beatty,
' where considerable time was consumed
I in the same discussion. None of the peo

j been said or what plan, If any, had been

i aid later in the day stated that he and
the Governor had called upon the Chief
Justice to see if he would listen to the
questions involved in the extradition mat

line of a habea--? corpus after considera

It is intimated that within the next day
or so there will be great developments in

A BABE FALLS TWENTY FEET,
BOUNCES TWO FEET AND LIVES
OAKLAND, Oct. 6.â Little Marx, the three-year-old son of Laurenz Jor- â 
genson, proprietor of the Brooklyn House in East Oakland, fell from â¢
a second-story window to-day to the sidewalk, a distance of about â 
twenty feet, but so far as Dr. A. H. Dodge could discover this after- â¢
noon, no bones were broken. It Is feared, however, that the child is inter- â 
nally injured.
A most peculiar feature of the fall, aside from the miraculous escape â 
from a horrible death, was the fact that when little Marx's form struck â¢
the bituminous sidewalk it bounced about two feet into the air and then â 
struck on the head. "
"I was in the front room getting ready to go out on a visit." said â 
Mrs. Jorgenson, "when I noticed Marx had climbed out on the window sill â¢
from the lounge. He was just in the act of grabbing for a bird cage when â 
he slipped. I reached to save him, but the distance was an inch or so too â¢
far, and down he went. I was horrified and expected to pick him up â 
dead." The father is at present on a visit to Denmark. \
DEPUE WILL TRY AGAIN.
Files Another Complaint for Di
vorce, Alleging Too Much
Parents-in-Law.
OAKLAND. Oct. 6.â James E. Depue
i has filed another divorce complaint
I against his wife, Grace M. Depue.
The complaint alleges that the couple
were married in January, 1890, residing
temporarily with the wife's parents. 1016
j Clay street; but Depue soon wearied of
I this arrangement, because of "to much
I father and mother in law." Then he
| agreed to provide a separate home, but
1 the wife would not budge. Depue in . Hi
returned to Chicago, where he had been
a teacher, and provided a home there,
but all his coaxing proved of no avail.
She preferred her parents. Depue tried
for a divorce once before, but Judge Og
i den refused to grant a decree. He stated
i at the previous trial and alleges in the
i present complaint that he does not har
\ monize with his parents-in-law and teels
that all of his wife's friends are consplr
j ing against him.
Mrs Depue is his second wife and the
I stepmother of Clare Depue, whose mys
terious disappearance caused so much
' talk and who. after being absent for nine
months, was located about two weeks
ago. The father claims that the 13-year
m!,i boy was spirited away and kept In
j hiding "by the mother.
To Make a Technical Fight.
OAKLAND, Oct. 6.â W. J. Nixon,
charged with selling liquors without a
license appeared in the Police Court to
day, pleaded not guilty and demanded a
jury trial The officers had a lively time
in arresting Nixon. To-day his attorney.
Colonel Garrity, tried to have the charge
dismissed as a demurrer, claiming that
the words "on or about" had been inter
lined in the primed complaint, and there
fore the time on which the alleged of
fense was committed was not stated with
â¢sufficient certainty. Judge Allen, how
ever, overruled the demurrer.

THE HOUSE OF
inn nuuuL ur
BLAZES MUST
BE REMOVED
Even the Old Shack
Is Mortgaged.
A CENTER OF HISTORY
SUPREME COURT AWARDS IT TO
THE MUNICIPALITY.
Nothing Now but a Mortgage to
Prevent the Immediate Open
Â»jig of Fallon
Street.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Oct. 6.
The House of Blazes is now the prop
erty of the city of Oakland, according to
a recent decision of the Supreme Court.
Ten years ago everybody who was any
body on either side of the bay heard of
the House of Blazes. It was a resort that
was very popular before electric roads
crossed the Twelfth street dam and
robbed the locality of its seclusion. Now
nobody would be sorry if the ramshackle
place, with its little summer houses, were
to go up in flames, with all the history,
pleasant and unpleasant, that it has
helped to make for nearly a generation.
Yet over this dilapidated wreck that is
suggestive of "good times" there is likely
to be a contest. A mortgage is held upon
it by a San Francisco bank, and although
the building put up at auction would not
fetch $50 for nrewoou, a great dt/al more
is likely to be spent before gallon street
is cut through from Eleventh to Twelfth.
The old resort is located in the middle of
the road, and now that the Supreme
Court has decided that the title to the
property is vested in the city of Oakland
the old house must go. About three years
ago the opposition to maintaining the
place was so great that its French pro
prietor went into insolvency, and no one
has yet ventured to assume its manage
ment. It has rapidly decayed, and there
is in existence a ledger containing some
of the records which many people would
wish destroyed. When the place was last
attached by the Sheriff this little record
THEY ATTEMPT
TO BREAK THE
TRUST CLAUSE
Contention Over the
Will of Sutro.
:THE HEIRS ARE RESTLESS
DO NOT CHOOSE TO WAIT FOR
THEIR .SHARE.
Distribution of the Vast Estate Will
Be Expedited if the Trouble
some Provision Is De
clared Invalid.
A majority of the heirs of the late
Adolph Sutro have decided to proceed as
did the heirs of the Fair estate and en
deavor to obtain a judgment of the court,
declaring the trust clause In the will of
the millionaire not only inoperative but
invalid.
With this end in view Clara A. Sutro,
Edgar E. Sutro, Kate Nusbaum and Rosa
V. Morblo Hied suit yesterday against
Emjna L. Merrltt and W. 11. R. Adamson,
as trustees under Sutro's will, and George
\V. Merritt and Charles W. Sutro, to quiet
title to a portion of the San Miguel
Rancho, which includes "The Heights"
and the beach properties, containing in
all about 1160 . acres.
The plaintiffs allege that the defend
ants, other than George W. Merrltt and
Charles W. Sutro, assert that they are
trustees under an instrument purporting
to be a will of Adolph Sutro, and as such
trustees, claim an interest in the property
on which it is sought to quiet title. The
other defendants, it is averred-, also claim
an interest in the real property adverse
to the plaintiffs, which claim plaintiffs al
lege is without right or foundation. Af
ter reciting these allegations, plaintiffs
pray that the adverse claims of the de
fendants, as trustees or otherwise, be de
termined; that all questions concerning
the validity of any gift, devise or trust,
under any instrument purporting to be a
will of Adolph Sutro, under or through
which the trustees claim, be finally ad
judicated and determined. That 4t be
adjudged and decreed that the defendants
have not, as trustees or otherwise, any
right, title or interest in the property.
That Emma L. Merritt and W. H. R.
Adamson, as trustees under said instru
ment purporting to be a will of Adolph
Sutro, be forever enjoined from asserting
any claim to any of the property belong
ing to the estate of Adolph Sutro, and
purporting to be devised in trust by the
Instrument to Emma L. Merritt and W.
H. R. Adamson, named in the instrument
as trustees.
Yesterday was the day set for further
hearing in the matter of the contest of
the will. Neither side was ready to pro
ceed and by agreement the case was con
tinued until the 14th mat.
TO SURVEY THE GAP.
Chief Engineer Storey of the Valley road
will leave this morning for Bakersfleld
for the purpose of inspecting the pro
posed route of the road from that city
through Tejon Pass to Los Angeles.
Mr. Storey expects to return in a week
or ten days and will then send a corps
of surveyors and engineers down to map
out the route and prepare it for actual
building. This, it is expected, will soon be
begun.
Charged With Felony.
Dr. J. B. McMahon. whose name was
mentioned in connection with the death of
Mrs. Rosenthal, who died from the effects
of a criminal operation, surrendered him
self to the police last evening and was
charged with a felony. He was immedi
ately released on 11000 bonds furnished by
his "friends.

the rent paid for the same if there were
any prospect of obtaining it.

ALAMEDA, Oct. 6.â There appear to ba
I two kinds of reports with regard to the
condition of the members of Company G,
Eighth Regiment, now at Vancouver bar
racks. A number of letters have been re
ceived from privates complaining about
I the manner in which they have been
! treated, and particularly, the food. Much
| sickness is said to prevail, and it was stat
ed that there were a number of ca
typhoid fever. It was alleged that during
drill the other day three men dropped iv
the ranks from weakness, brought on by
unnecessary hardship. On the other hand,
ja letter from Sergeant Harvey of the
| company says that the acci unts of hard
. ships have been exaggerated, as v, - ell as
of sickness. He says that the illness has
not been serious, being mostly colds from
the change of climate, and that the stories
of ill treatment are, for the most part,
unfounded.
To Consider the Tax Levy.
OAKLAND. Oct. 6.â The Mayor has
called a special meeting of the City Coun
cil for to-morrow night to consider the
tax levy. He has prepared a statement
which he will present and which c
that the ordinance ;>s passed by the
Council will leave a big deficit in" the
funds of every department. He was peti
tioned to-day by ISO university students
who use the free library to veto the ordi
nance.

RUNNERS' GLORY
Wins the Citrus Belt
Selling Stakes.
CLOSE TO THE COAST RECORD
COVERS THE MILE AND A HALF
IN 2:32 1-2.
The 2:15 Trot a Terrific Contest, in
Which Osito, the Favorite,
Is Beaten by
Thompson.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 6.â Even if tho
card to-day did wear a hagg-ard look it
furnished some rare sport, which was
â¢witnessed by a good-sized crowd.
The 2:15 trot was a terrific contest,final
ly resulting in a victory for Thompson,
the Vendome stock farm representative,
driven by Charles Bunch, but not until
seven stubbornly fought heats had been
ground off.
Grady upheld the glory of the runners
by taking the Citrus Belt selling stakes
from Marplot, covering the mile and a
half in 2:32 l -j. dangerously close to the
coast record made by Buckwa at Oak
land. Favorite followers suffered many
reverses.
Osito, favorite for the trot, placed his
followers in stringent circumstances, and
all of the first choices in the four running
events were turned toward the wall.
The trot for members of the 2:13 class
became badly broken before it was final
ly brought to a finish. In the early pool
ing Osito, a son of McKinney, driven by
W. G. Durfee, had the call, bringing 6
against 10 for the field. He was kept
in the background for three heats before
his party concluded they had had their
little ball of yarn wound up. Thompson
took the opening heat from Lou in a hard
drive, and the books that laid 6 and S to
1 against him were singed. Although
lame after the first heat, Lou annexed
the one following with the two favorites,
Thompson and Osito, finishing second
and fourth respectively. Then Thompson
grabbed the third heat from Silver Ring
and Lou, after which he ruled favorite,
both in the auction betting and books.
In the fourth heat Osito came out with
different head gear on, and the educated
ones sent the checks in on him, cutting
his price in the books for the heat from 6
to 2. Jimmy Sullivan, behind Sable
Frances, thought just about this time the
field was getting back to his mares
mark, and she was played from 20 down
to 8. After an exciting heat, during the
progress of which Osito and his driver
got much the worst of the jockeying, the
latter horse led Sable Frances past the
judges a length in Â«:17-V
Alter this Osito was chalked a 2 to 5
choice for the next heat and finished sec
ond, downed a length by Sable Frances,
after Silver Ring had made a lively pace
to the stretch. The crowd seemed deter
mined to make Osito win and he WuS a
piping hot choice for the sixth heat,
which he managed to annex, after a live
ly brush at the end with Sable Frances.
It was now quite evident that the Latter
had had enough for he finished weary
> joking &nd tired.
When Thompson, which had apparent
ly been rested up for three heats, came
out for the seventh essay, he was full of
ginger and looked all over "Hawkins"
horse." The field was given the word, the
favorite was afforded no protection, being
sent away last and was cut on* at the
first turn. At the half Thompson took
the front position from Sable Frances,
and. though given a desperate rub at the
end by Osito, won the heat and race fciy
half a length.
The Citrus Belt stake, worth about $525,
the star event of the running part of the
programme, drew out but a field of three.
Marplot with 93 pounds and Devin,' in the
saddle, closed a 9 to 20 choice, with 3 to
2 offered on Grady, piloted by Mike Hen
nessy and packing 108 pounds. Hennessy's
handling of Grady was perfect. Marplot
went out and tried to make a runaway
race of it, but Hennessy sailed hot after
him. and at the end of a mile covered |
in 1:39 flat, the Fresno horse had the fa
vorite beaten. â¢ Grady had speed to burn
the last quarter and won cleverly by a
couple of lengths. Petrarch was eased
up.
The first event run, a &â > furlong- dash,
shook the talent badly. William 08, car
ried ail the big commissions at the short
price of 1 to 2. and outfooted from the
start, finished third. Tom Smith, an S-to-1
shot, piloted by Bullman. skipped away
lii the lead and was never headed, beating
the wretchedly ridden Queen Nubia over
a length. Ruiz, who rode the latter, !s
evidently preparing- himself for a Ion? va
cation and will probably not be disap
pointed.
It was soft traveling for the 2-year-old
llidlove In the six-furlong sprint.
Opening up at 8 to 3 the stable money was
â withheld until her odds reached 11 to >.
when a scramble was made and her price
reduced to 6 to 5. She won all the way. The
9 to 10 choice. Toribio. got up in time to
ret the place from Pat Murphy in a hard
drive. The crowd got aboard Ojai to pace
off the final" four-and-one-half-furlong spin
for 2-year olds, hut he was beaten out in
a drive by the Burns & Waterhouse en
try. Naplan. neglected to a great extent
in the betting. Summary:

THE SOUTHERN
PACIFIC IN A
BAD PLIGHT
Admits That It Has No Fran
chise for Its City Tracks.
Citizens of the Mission Organized to Foil Its
Attempt to Secure Permanent Rights
in the Heart of the City.
The Southern Pacific Railroad Company,
through Its attorney John E. Foulds,
made an unexpected admission to the
Street Committee of the Board of Super
visors yesterday afternoon. It was to
the effect that the railroad never did have
a -written permit, to say nothing of a
franchise, to operate a railroad track
through the heart of San Francisco.
This interesting bit of information de
veloped through the cross questioning of
Thomas B. Slevin, president of the Mis
sion and Potrero Improvement Club, who
appeared before the Street Committee, in
company with nine other members of the
organization, to protest against the grnnt
, ing of a permit to the Southern Pacific
to lay a double track line to its depot at
Third and Townsend streets, in place of
the single track line which it is now ope
rating.
Slevin pressed the question upon Attor
ney Foulds as to what authority the
Southern Pacific had for operating a track
over Harrison street. So far as he could
find, by searching the records, no permis
sion had ever been granted to the railroad
to lay rails in that thoroughfare.
To this query Foulds replied: "There
are more ways than one to secure a fran
chise to operate our tracks. Admitting
that there was no written order giving
the company the right to lay tracks on
Harrison street that can be found at the
present time I contend that the
city and county maps now in exis
tence place the Southern Pacific tracks on
that street and others and that this map
is official. Therefore the right of the com
pany to have a track there is legally rec
ognized."
This remarkable statement produced a
sensation among the auditors. Several
members of the improvement club pro
tested that the mere fact that the maps
showed a railroad line along a certain in
dicated route could not be construed into
a permissi(\n for the permanent posses
sion of a right of way. The railroad had
gradually usurped the property and
streets through San Francisco, giving out
the statement that it was only a tempo
rary occupation until it could build Its
line along the water front, where it did
possess a franchise. The objectors de
clared that the track ran through a thick
ly populated district and that the trains
were such a noisy and dirty nuisance .that
adjacent property had deteriorated fifty
per cent as a result. They demanded pro
tection from the Supervisors, declaring
that if the railroad company was granted
the permit to lay a double track, it
would, in effect, be a perpetual franchise,
allowing the Southern Pacific for all time
to operate its trains through the heart of
ban Francisco, instead of skirting the city
along the water front, as it should do. to
the inconvenience of the smallest number
of people and the resulting advantage of
the great mass of citizens. B
Â»yl \tT Kenny, a well-known resident of
\ht sslo . ' S 3^ 8 - 11 effective speech on
tnÂ»t tH, bj ? & !al(lÂ£! al( lÂ£ '" Xt is a well-known
fact that the Southern Pacific has usurped
rights in this city that could never have
been .obtained by legal means. The pres
ent route of the road through the city is
usurped. It sneaked in on an alleged
sidetrack for some time, saying that It
was only a temporary 'spur,' but it grad
ually lengthened and lengthened until it
pierced the city. Now the company is
seeking to make their squatter's rights
permanent. Thousands of people bought
homes out in the Mission district on the
statement that the railroad track was
only temporary and that the nuisance
of the trains would soon be abated. Now
the company tries by trick to get tne
Board of Supervisors to legalize its un
lawful acts of encroachment and to place
it in possession of a permanent double
track through the heart of San Fran
cisco. Such a thing means irretrievable
disaster. They propose to stay right
where they are, those railroad tricksters,
and not to build the line around the city,
where they are supposed to go. Why you
can't keep plaster on the walls of a
house within two blocks of their railroad
trains. A blind man would think there
was a perpetual earthquake machine in
operation out there. We object. We want
the railroad to get out. and are willing
to allow reasonable timeâ say two or three
yearsâ the proposed grant of a double
track permit is in the direction of a per
petual nuisance."
Other members of the improvement club
paid their compliments to the Southern
Pacific as a "corporation without de
cency" and "an evader of taxes," as a
thief that came in the night and stole real
estate, both public and private. The war
waxed warm, to the evident disquiet of
the Southern Pacific's attorney and aÂ»so
of Supervisor Britt. who presided as
chairman of the Committee on Streets.
The Supervisor was plainly in favor of the
Southern Pacific, assisting the railroad at
torney as against the people of the Mis
sion. This fact was evidenced a number
of times by his remarks and questions,
all of which were calculated to assist the

WIFE'S AWFUL
ECZEMA
My -wife was in the most horrible condition
of any human being, from Eczema. She could
neither sit down nor lie down, her torture was
so intense. I tried all the doctors that I could
reach, but she got so that I firmly believe she
-would have died -within twelve hours if I had
not been advised of Cuticcka Remedies and
got them. My â wife went to sleep in two hours
after the first application, although aho had
not slept for seven days, and with two boxes
of_ConconA (ointment) and one cake of
Cuticuba Soap she teas absolutely cured, and
is well and hearty to-day.

railroad's case. Supervisor Delany. who
was the only one of the eommitteemen to
remain with Britt throughout the discus
sion, did not express any opinion as to
what should be done. He finally left, and
then Britt stated to the representatives or
the improvement club that he could see
no reason why the" Southern Pacific could
not us well have two tracks as one to the
depot. He did not believe that the grant
ing of the permit for the double track
would make any material difference.
To this view the improvement club took
quick exception.
"Then why don't you get out an in
junction against the Supervisors grant
ing the permit?" asked Britt of several
members of the delegation.
"We do not suppose that will be neces
sary." was the reply; "the Supervisors
will certainly not perpetrate such an out
rage as to grant the permit for a double
track."
Britt seemed to think the other way,
and the representatives of the citizens of
the Mission retired considerably disturbed
in mind. The matter may come up at the
meeting of the Supervisors next Monday,
although several difficulties will be en
countered. The City and County Attor
ney has been asked for an opinion as to
the right of the Supervisors to grant the
double track permit and he, in turn, has
requested the Supervisors' clerk to furnish
him with an abstract of title of all prop
erty along four miles of the company's
present tracks in the city, with full in
l>rmation as to all permits, rights, etc.,
granted to the Southern Pacific since its
advent in California. This the clerk says
will take him at least six months to ac
complish, and he will so state to the
City and County Attorney, so that the lat
ter will not delay acting on the request
for an opinion.
The people of the Mission and con
tiguous districts are up in arms against
grantiug the railroad a permanent right
of way and an injunction suit may be
filed within a few days, if it becomes evi
dent that other Supervisors besides Britt
favor the railroad.
One other matter which came before the
Street Committee is worthy of mention.
A large number of protests had been re
ceived from taxpayers along certain
streets In the suburbs, asking that pro
posed improvements in the way of bitu
men paving, macadamizing, etc., should
not be made at this time. Superintendent
Ambrose had recommended paving on a
number of streets at the expense of the
property owners, and the latter kicked,
as shown by the protests. In several
cases it was alleged that the work was
entirely unnecessary and would cost more
than the value of the property. The
Street Committee took the same view of
the matter as the petitioners against the
work and decided that nothing should be
done at this time on the following pro
posed improvements:
Curbing and paving Nineteenth street, be
tween Church and Sanchez.
Paving of Buchanan etreet, between Filbert
and Greenwich.
Paving of. Buchanan street, between Union
and Filbert.
Paving of Second avenue, between Point Lo
bos and Clement street.
Paving on Nineteenth, between Church and
Sanchez.
Paving of Selina place, oft California street,

Grading of I street, between Twelfth and
Thirteenth avenues.
Paving of Elm avenue, between Pierce and
Scott streets.
Paving on Piwce street, between Vallejo and
Green.
Paving of Collingwood street, between Nine
teenth and Twentieth.
Paving of Buchanan street, between Green
wich and Lombard.
Paving of Cedar avenue, between Octavla and
Laguna.
Paving of Elizabeth place, off Folsom, and
between Third and Fourth Ptreets.
Paving of Gough street, between Greenwich
and Lombard.
Paving of Fell street, between Fillmore and
Steiner.
Paving of Cole street, between Fell and
Hayes.
Macadamizing of L street, between Tenth and
Eleventh avenues.
Paving of Masonic avenue, between Page and
Oak streets.
Paving of Lyon street, between Golden Gate
avenue and Turk street.
Paving crossing of Pierce and Green streets.
Cobbling Central avenue, between Waller and

Grading and macadamizing Valley street,
from Sanchez to Noe streets.

The committee will report in favor of
bituminizing and curbing Pierce street,
between Green and Union; bituminizing
and curbing Pacific avenue, between
crossing of Pacific avenue and Lyon
street; bituminizing crossing of Jackson
and Lyon streets.
The allegation is made that Superin
tendent Ambrose recommended numerous
Improvements in order to take care of
contractors just at this time when work
is slack. The Superintendent denies this
charge, and says that many property
owners wanted the improvements and
that they were recommended at their sug
gestion.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, QCTOBI* 7, 1898.
BOAT AND PIER PLANS OF THE
PROJECTED NEW OAKLAND FERRY
Emeryville, Where the Terminal Company Will Locate Its Distribut
ing Depot.
THE exclusive announcement in The Call of yesterday that arrangements were nearly completed for the be
ginning of the construction of a new, up-to-date ferry system to give a fast, cheap, exclusive passenger ser
vice between Oakland and San Francisco, was received with great satisfaction on both sides of the bay. It
has been long known that such a service was greatly needed, not only for the material welfare of Oakland
as a city but for the proper accommodation of the traveling public. But up to the present time investors who
were bidding for traffic only have been intimidated by the great mogulâ the Southern Pacific Company. However,
in the case of the new enterprise launched by the Realty Syndicate the ferry has become a necessity to the
company in order that its immense real estate holdings may be properly developed and the just share of street
car traffic diverted to its system of roa/ia. These propositions are aside from the fact that the promoters of the
enterprise regard the investment as a good proposition on a transportation basis alone, and approach the matter
with confidence and money. These two are the prime elements necessary to make the venture a big success.
The final adjustment of the transfer of the Emery tract to the syndicate, thereby affording the company a
perfect basis for the operation of a ferry line under favorable conditions gave the enterprise a solid sendoff and
from this time forward the scheme will be rapid and successful.
The ferry business will be under the management of the Terminal Company, forming a part of the Realty
Syndicate. Plans for the construction of the mole from Emeryville and for the ferryboats have been accepted
as described in these columns yesterday. The accompanying illustrations will give a fair idea of what the new
company proposes to do in the way of affording real comfort and even luxuries to those who cross the bay to
the modern Athens. The system" will be an innovation in that it will for a cheap fare provide the public with
clean boats built for passengers only, boats that can show their heels to anything on the bay. These will be
connected with electric car service on the Oakland side that will give ideal accommodations to the long-suf
fering people of that city and its suburbs. Considering what they are subjected to at present they will doubt
less give a hearty welcome to the company which is coming forward to solicit their patronage and sympathy.
ROBBED A
WOMAN OF
HER BENT
Thief's Bold Work in
the Mission.
SECURED LITTLE BOOTY
TOOK MONEY FROM UNDER THE
MATTRESS ON THE BED.
Mrs. Sanchez Aroused by the Burg
lar's Movements but Too Much
Alarmed to Make an
Outcry. /
A most daring robbery was committed
in the Mission at an early hour yesterday
morning. A robber broke into the house
at 2723 Twentieth street, in which a Mrs.
Sanchez lives, and took her little hoard of
money from under the mattress on which
she was lying. As he was leaving the
house the woman gave a strangled
scream, which so scared die robber that
he slammed the door and aroused the
other people living there. The woman's
son jumped out of bed and gave chase,
but the robber had gone.
Mrs. Sanchez was very much excited
when seen about the robbery last night.
"I had my little grandchild in the bed
with me," she said. "We were both sound
asleep, and I was aroused by a slight
noise in the room. I looked around, and
saw a man searching in some fancy boxes
I keep on the bureau. He had a lamp in
his hand. It was only a small thing, be
cause when he was running away he
closed it up and put it in his pocket.
"After he got through ' searching the
bureau he looked at the bed and saw I
was awake. I was so scared I could hard
ly breathe. He had a gun in his hand,
and said, 'If you scream I will kill you.
He asked me where my money was, but I
couldn't utter a word. Tfren he searched
under the pillow and put his hand down
under the mattress. At CBe foot of the
bed he found $8 in silver.
"He moved away from the bed for a mo
ment, and I gave a gasp which was half
a scream. This frightened him, and he
made a run for the hallway. As he passed
out into the street he closed the door with
a bang that shook the house and awoke
the other tenants. I don't remember any
thing after that.
"The man was about medium height and
stout. He had on a broken derby hat and
a light sack suit. He was rather good
looking and had a mustache. His eyes
and complexion I could not see. aa he
held the lantern low and threw the light
on the bed." .â_
Mrs. Sanchez's son notified the Seven
teenth-street police station, and Officers
J A Fitzgerald and R. F. Graham have
been detailed on --- c case. Officer Fitz
gerald says that Mrs. Sanchez told him
Ft was part of her rent the robber stole
and that the man knew the premises well
and evidently expected to make a hauL
SINGING OF
PODDIE ROSS
Miss Poddie Ross sang in the Baldwin
Theater yesterday afternoon to a num
erous audience largely made up of the
folk of the musical and theatrical pro
fession. Everybody that attended had
read more or less about her â especially
the announcement which proclaimed her
voice superior to Melba's and Nordlca'sâ
and everybody was curious, to say the
least, to measure the quality of her art
and talent. Miss Ross had only to sing
a few bars of the big Violetta scene from
"Traviata" and Melba and Nordlca were
thought of no more. There is really no
need for dragging them Into the ques
tion. Miss Robb has her own voice, her
own schooling, her own personality, and
she should have been announced and ad
vertised on the strength of theseâ it
would have been only fair and kind. For
Miss Ross does nothing in the vocal way
that would seem to court comparison
with these singers. She possesses a
young, limber soprano, easily poised and
fluent in the upper register, quit birdie
in its tone and capable now and then of
really brilliant coloratura work; but there
is not much stamina in any of her sus
tained notes, and in the legato passages
of the "Traviata" excerpt she sar.g un
mistakably out of the key. The "Night
ingale" song by Alableffe and the "Lak
me" legend sounded the brilliancies of
her voice to better advantage. They were
charmingly given. Had Miss Ross been
more modestly Introduced her success
would have been greater. But even as it
was the audience soon accepted her at
her proper valueâ a clever girl of 23, with
study, musical sympathy, strength and
a future ahead of her.
A notable feature of the concert was
Hugo Mansfeldt's performance of Liszt's
E flat concerto. Mr. Mansfeldt is in no
sense a sensational pianist; often he is
too miniature; but he has delicacy, form,
conscience and almost unchallengeable
technique, and these qualities were splen
didly brought to bear on the Liszt piece.
Among the shorter pieces played by Mr.
Mjmsfeldt was one unfamiliar to me and
written, I am told, by the player. It is
very poetic and delightfully constructed,
and in the rendition the player did the
composer full justice. Mr. yon der Mehden
led the orchestra of thirty-five without
any conspicuous disaster.

SACRED HEART CHURCH FAIR.
Formal Opening Made Last Evening
Before an Immense Audience.
The charitable bazaar in aid of the Sa
cred Heart Church was formally opened
last evening at Armory Hall, corner of
Page and Gough streets, by Mayor Phe
lati.
In opening the fair the Mayor intro
duced an effort on the part of tho clergy
of the church which has for its object the
raising of funds for the completion of the
new Sacred Heart Church, lately dedicat
ed to the service of God on the corner of
Page and Fillmore streets.
The address by the Mayor was both elo
quent and interesting, as it reviewed the
noble work of the pastor of the church
and complimented his success in securing
for the people of his parish a house of
worship to which they can look with
pride.
Immediately after the address the
wheels, as it were, of the fair were put
in motion and the work for which it has
been designed formally begun by a host
of pretty girls, who showed their tact,
srkill and gentle persuasion in the disposal
of the various wares with which their
different booths abounded.
In honor of the occasion an elaborate
programme was presented, which includ
ed the remii ,on of music, both vocal and
instrumental, and many other like at
tractions which go to make a perfect pro
gramme of interest and enjoyment.
The fair will be open every evening un
til further notice, and the general public
is cordially invited to attend, if for noth
ing more than to obtain a vle'wr of the glo
rious interior decoration of the hall, a
real work of art, executed entirely by the
ladies in charge of the different booths.

HIS STAR TO
BE DIMMED OF
ITS LUSTER
Charge Made Against
a Special.
THOMAS KELLY IN TROUBLE
WHILE INTOXICATED HE AR
RESTS AN INNOCENT MAN.
John A- Phillips, a Well-Known Citi
zen, Abased and Thrown in
Prison by a Peace
Guardian.
Special Officer Thomas TV. Kelly, who
has a beat in Hayes Valley, will in all
probability be relieved of his star at the
next meeting of the Police Commission
ers.
Late Wednesday night Kelly, who was
under the influence of liquor, placed John
A. Phillips, a well-known drayman, under
arrest for disturbing: the peace. The
officious special was Informed that a row
was in progress at Ivy avenue and
Franklin street, and, going to the place,
he encountered Phillips. "Without at
tempting to ascertain the cause of the
trouble Kelly, evidently anxious to make
a record, seized Phillips by the arm and
told him he was under arrest. Phillips
tried to explain that he was not a party
to the row, and asked to be released.
With an oath the special tightened his
grip on his arm and started to take his
prisoner to police headquarters.
When opposite the Central station Kelly
took Phillips to a saloon and compelled
him to buy the drinks. After they had
emerged from the saloon Sergeant Mc-
Manus, who is acquainted with Phillips,
realizing that the special had made amis
take in arresting the drayman, asked him
for an explanation.
Kelly replied that Phillips had commit
ted a serious breach of the peace and
that he intended to lock him up. Phillips
appealed to McManus not to allow the
special to throw him in prison, claiming
he was innocc-nt of the charge attributed
to him.
"Keep your face closed if you are next
to yourself," angrily retorted Kelly. "I'm
hot here for my health."
Phillips again started to explain that
the special had made a mistake, when
the latter roughly caught him by the arm
and started with him for the City Prison.
McManus waited until Kelly had booked
his prisoner for disturbing the peace, and
then, accosting the special, invited him to
go over to the Southern station. Lieuten
ant Hannah was in charge at the time,
and, seeing Kelly's condition, he at once
deprived him of his star.
Yesterday formal charges were pre
ferred against the special.
When Phillips' case was called in Judge
Mogan's court yesterday morning Kelly
failed to appear and the charge against
the drayman was dismissed.

The Matter to Come Up Again To-
Day at a Meeting of the
Health and Police
Committee.
There -will be a meeting of the Health
and Police Committee of the Supervisors
to-day at which Captain P. M. Delany
will have something to say regarding the
lease for Devany's Stanyan-street cyclery,
which School Director Ragan was In such
a rush to have recorded last Monday, that
he forgot to acknowledge his own signa
ture to the instrument, although he per
formed that office for the five Supervisors,
parties of the second part.
Captain Delany will not give out an
advance sheet of his speech; he will not
even outline it, but from the nature of
his remarks to the assembled deputies in
the Recorder's office, when he learned that
the document had been filed, and from
what he has let drop on the subject since
then, his discourse is expected to be upon
lines something like these:
"Fellow members of the Health and
Police Committee: As you are doubtless
aware, I have discovered a couple of par
ties who are selling gold bricks in San
Francisco, and ttiat the city and county
has invested in one of these eye-ticklers.
D. F. Ragan and J. J. McDade are the
brass-bullion merchants, and it is pal
pable that they are new to the business,
even though we did Invest in their wares.
"Now, gentlemen, I wish to say that I
was flim-flammed into signing this lease
for the Stanyan-street police station. It
was a clear case of bunco. I supposed 1
was signing some resolution to go before
the board and the insinuation that those
fellows opened wine for me before l
signed it does me a gross injustice; those
fellows wouldn't uncork a bottle or im
ported beer. , _ ... .
"What 1 want to say. is this: I think
these fellows are getting scared and we
can make better terms for that lease than
the present arrangements. v\ ny, Â«aÂ«an
came to me the other day and suggested
that we only take part of the b ull Â£ing-
He said it was altogether too large for a
police station in that district, and if we
took, say, half of it. we could get it for
$125 a montU. Now, there s an idea for
you. We can get the whole building for
$166 or half of It for $125. Having sold us
one' gold brick he thinks we are crying for
another. And it may be he has another
victim in sight, who is panting for a
change to pay him $125 a month for the
other half of the place, giving him an
income of $250 from the property instead
of $166 under .the terms of the lease he
was so anxious to get on record I don't
understand this man Ragan, but I guess
he knows his business.
This and a lot more the Supervisor from
the Third is expected to say, all of which
will make choice reading for the taxpay
pt4 CaDtain Delany spent much of the
time yesterday at the City Hall, but had
little to say about the lease. He did
make a few statements however, thaÂ«
were most interesting. He was asked
how he learned about the document being
in existence If he was not aware that he
S was in the board meeting Monday."
answered the captain. "Supervisor Clin
ton came to me and asked why I had
sisned It I denied having done any such
thing and he insisted that I had. I was
so positive I had done nothing of the
kind that I said: 'If any man says I
signed that lease he lies.' Clinton stuck
to It, however, and I rushed over to the
Recorder's office to see if It was there.

And I found it," he added, reflectively.
"What are you going to do about It?"
I can't say until the committee meets
to-morrow. Then I shall probably have
something to say about these gold-brick
peddlers."
"Captain, It seems the matter has finally
passed the board after ail. What objec
tion have you to the lease as It stands''"
Delany broke into a laugh. "Say, you
ought to see Jt," he finally answered.
It s a daisy."
'I understand that Ragan has not ac
knowledged it, that none of the commit
tee acknowledged it, that it shows evi
dence of having been tampered with af
ter having been signed and besides it
does not bind Ragan to anything, while
McDade does not figure in it at aIL Is
there anything else the matter with it?"
"Say, my boy, how many pieces of
paper is that lease written on?"
"Three, not including the County Clerk's
acknowledgement."
"Well, don't you know that such docu
ments are usually embodied on one piece
of paper?" and the captain winked as he
walked off to find a secluded place where
in to rehearse his speech for to-day.
THE WIDBER TRIAL
NEARING A CLOSE
THE FINAL ARGUMENT OF THE;
DEFENSE CONCLUDED.
Attorney Peixotto Pleads for Mercy
and Asks a Careful Delibera- J
tion of the Testimony; Â â¢
Presented.
â  - /
The closing argument in defense of ex-
Treasurer Widber for the embezzlement
of $118,000 of the city funds was presented
to the jury yesterday afternoon by Attor
ney Edgar D. Peixotto. The main point
emphasized in the exhaustive review of
the alleged weakness of the evidence in
troduced by the prosecution was that' thÂ»
confession made by the prisoner in the
presence of Mayor Phelan, the Auditor
and other municipal officers was not vol
untarily given by Widber, but was wrung
and forced from him in a moment of de
spondency and when he was in no condi
tion to judge the assertions he made. It
was forced from him " It was claimed,
when the defendant was absolutely Ignor
ant of the meaning of the questions asked.
"He was dragged from his home," said
the attorney, "by this ambitious and as
tute Mayor for the purpose of covering
the latter's tracks by being forced : to
make a confession." i
The actual fact that Widber had made
a confession was claimed as no criterion
that he had committed the crime.
In concluding the argument Peixottu
said:
"You can't drag a man from his homa
where he is suffering from despondency
and mental disease and extort answers
from him. Such an outrage is not gov
ernment; it is tyranny.
"The case is before youâ judge it. I ask
no sympathy, but I plead for the princi
ples of liberty. You never can regret do
ing right: you never can regret being
charitable. Remember, gentlemen, the
suffering of the boy's motner. who cries
out to you in her sorrow: 'Take not from
me my boy on such flimsy and unsub
stantial testimony.' "
During the morning session of the trial
an argument was presented by Attorney
Charles H. Wilson, representative o*. the
Fidelity and Deposit Company of Balti
more, surety on Widber's bond. He ex
plained that there could be no possible
douot concerning the truth of the charge
that Widber had embezzled the money,
had confessed to the embezzlement in
public, and that his subsequent denials of
the facts admitted were false to a degree,
his was a case in which mere sentiment
should play no part, in the counsel's opin
ion; it was a question of simple justice
merely.
At the conclusion of Mr. Wilson's ad
dress Edgar D. Peixotto spoke. Actlnp
District Attorney John A. Hosmer w'l
make the concluding argument for thÂ«
prosecution this morning.
