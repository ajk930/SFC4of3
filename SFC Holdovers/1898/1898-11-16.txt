SPAIN WILL NOT
RECEDE FROM
HER POSITION
Unless the Desired Concessions
fire Made No Treaty of
Peace Will Be Sigoed.
Uncle San) in No Mind for Further Dilly-dally
ing â May Resort Again to Arms
and Seize tl}e Philippines.
MADRID, Nov. 15.â According to semi-official statements here
the Spanish Peace Commissioners will maintain their pres
ent attitude in regard to the Philippine Islands and will ccr r
tainly not accept the conditions of the United States. Fur
ther, if the discussion does not return to the limits of the protocol,
as viewed by the Spaniards, the Spanish Commissioners have de
cided in spite of contrary reports not to sign a treaty of peace.
It is also learned from the same sources that complete accord
prevails between the Spanish Government and its Peace Commis
sioners.
SPANIARDS ARE TREADING
ON TREACHEROUS GROUND
WASHINGTON, Nov. 15.âAdminis
tration officials do not share the opin
ion expressed in some quarters that the
Paris Peace Commission will fail in its
efforts to agree upon a treaty. This
opinion is not based upon any specific
information received from Paris, but
rather upon the fact that by withdraw
ing from the conference Spain has
u>>thing to gain and all to lose.
It is undoubtedly true that should
the Spaniards adopt this course they
â would sacrifice ttie indemnity this Gov
ernment is now disposed to grant, and
would also precipitate trouble for
themselves all along the line. The
United States undoubtedly would im
mediately take forcible possession of
the entire Philippine group and at
once enter upon a military and naval
campaign, which would end only upon
an unconditional surrender of what
ever territory this Government might
see fit to demand.
It is believed that the United States
at this time would consent to a cash
payment of from $20,000,000 to $25,000,
000 rather than renew the war, but the
longer a final settlement is delayed tha
smaller will be the indemnity. In any
event, the President is not disposed to
brook unnecessary prolongation of the
negotiations, and it is believed has so
Indira teil to our Peace Commissioners.
SYNDICATE SCHEME VIEWED
AS A SPANISH RUSE
WASHINGTON, Nov. 15.â Inquiry
has been made int<> the character of the
projectors of the remarkable syndicate
scheme for the purchase of the Philip
pines for the sum of $400,000,000. The
result has been to show that they are
irresponsible parties and it is scarcely
to be doubted that the project has been
put forward as a means of enhancing
the price which the Spaniards may de
mand for the relinquishment of the
Philippines. In other words, the Span
iards might claim justification for de
manding a sum as large as $200,000,000
if they could point to the fact that a
syndicate stood ready to pay double
that price for the islands.

CUBA MUST BE CLEAR OF
SPANIARDS JANUARY 1
WASHINGTON, Nov. 15.â The Gov
ernment has renewed and strength
ened its determination that the Span
ish evacuation of Cuba and the Ameri
can occupation shall not be deferred
beyond January 1 next. This conclu
sion has been communicated to the
Spanish Government within the last

Special Dispatch to The CaH
I issued a decree permitting priests to
bury Mason?, was called to the attention
of Pr. Rooker, Secretary of the Legation,
this evening.
"We have received no information about
these reports," said Dr. Rooker. "All we
know about them is what we have seen
in the newspapers. Even if Father Zur
chcr's book had been condemned, we
would have no official knowledge about it.
In such case Fatber Zurcher would be no
tified of the papal decree. I believe a
priest whose book is condemned is given
n year in which to submit whatever he
wlsnes to say about it and to destroy
copies of the book he is able to secure
from circulation. A priest, before print
ing a book, must submit it to the bishop
of the diocese in which it is to be printed
and must have the imprimature of the
bishop.
"So far as the decree regarding the
burial of Masons is concerned, we know
nothing of it. No Catholic can be a
Freemason, and the church Is not in the
habit of burying people who are not Cath
olics."
SCHLEY IS IMPRESSED
WITH PORTO RICO
Rear Admiral Thinks the Future Has
Great Things in Store for
the Island.
"WASHINGTON. Nov. 15. â Admiral
Sehley. who Is in Washington, said to The
Call correspondent to-day:
"I. am greatly impressed with Porto
Rico. I think it has. under the domina
tion of the I'nited States, a brilliant fu
ture. Of course the industries of the isl
and are not developed as fully as they
would be under our system of govern
ment and with our energy. It will be nec
essary first to educate the people to the
new regime, for the reason that 400 years
of Spanish domination have established,
not only the customs, but the language
and methods of the political government,
which are largely at variance with our
system of government. It is the contrast
of day and night. Much Is to be said,
however, in favor of the people of Porto
Rico. They are peaceable and gentle and
entirely unaccustomed to war, and I think
could be easily molded to our way of do
ing things. There was a very marked
feeling of gratification plainly visible
among the native Porto Ricans at the
evacuation of the Spanish army.
"I think Porto Ricans, having enjoyed
a longer period of freedom from devastat
ing wars, are in much better condition for
progress than the Cubans. The former
will yield much more readily to the new
order of things than the latter," conclud
ed the Admiral.
PROMINENT MASONS

BRECKINRIDGE'S
LOW ESTIMATE
OF SHAFTER
Intimated His Superior's Talents
Were Inadequate to the
Situation.
Declared That Results Before Santiago Would
Have Been Different if General Miles
WASHINGTON, Nov. 15. â Gen
eral Breckinridge's testimony to
day dealt with the campaign in Cuba
and the transportation of troops to that
island. He had, he said, gone to Cuba
as inspector general. Arriving at
Tampa on the sth of June, he had ob
served casually the preparations for the
disembarkation of troops before the ex
pedition left and had concluded that
they were quite inadequate.
"I made no report, however," he said,
"as General Miles was on the ground
and could observe for himself."
He was questioned at some length
concerning the conduct of the cam
i paign in front of Santiago, and replied
that the result was what he had ex
pected it would be. Everything there,
| he said, was strained to get men on
board, and, consequently, there was
comparatively little effort to secure
! equipment. While he knew nothing
: definitely of the plans of the campaign,
he was sure there was some plan. He
| was quite certain, from a conversation
i he had with General Miles, that he had
] a plan, though he did not say that this
| was the plan carried into effect.
"Of course," suggested Governor
! Beaver, "Santiago was the goal of the
j campaign?"
"Certainly."
Asked as to his opinion of the result
of the campaign, he said he thought it
was consistent with the character of
the men who conducted it â what was to
1 be expected from the limitations of
General Shatter.
"I think it would have been differ
ent," he said, "if General Miles had
been in commandâ ffcat it would have
been more satisfactorily conducted. I
think he has more of the spark and
genius of command than any man in
the army, and I am sure that if he had
had charge he would have been in the
front rank."
Ex-Governor Woodbury suggested
that the battle in front of San Juan
had been fought and the victory won
within eight days of landing.
General Breckinridge in reply said
the victory had been won "when Gen
eral Toral's nerve gave out." This, he
continued, had been the war of all
others when success had been won in
its earliest stages. He believed that
the war was the Lord's war, and that
this wonderful success was due to his
supervision. The time for the battle
was, however, short enough. Yet, it
must be remembered that the distance
between the battlefield and Sibony was
less than half a day's march, but, while
he considered the result as marvelous
ly commendable, he did not feel that
General Shafter was above criticism in
the conduct of the campaign. He could
not believe the result was a miracle,
but he ascribed the outcome to the fact
that the ai.ny was one which was ca
pable of meeting all calls.
"No matter how it was tangled up,"
he said, "it went to victory."
He had at the time quoted Lord
Beresford, when he said to his army
upon a certain occasion:
"I have led you into a devil of a fix,
and it is now your duty to fight like
hell to get me out of it."
He was sure, at least, that all en

MAJOR GENERAL JOSEPH C. BRECKJNRIDGE.
Had Commanded.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
General McCook asked General
Breckinridge if he had visited General
Shafter in his tent when the latter was
ill at Santiago, and General Breckin
ridge replied that he had done so.
"Did he then offer the command of
the army to you, as has been reported
in the press?"
General Breckinridge replied:
â  "I very much prefer not to answer
that question. You should ask General
Shafter. Such a conversation as oc
curred between General Shafter and
myself on that occasion is not of a
character to be spoken of lightly. I
fail to see how a reply from me would
promote the object of your inquiry. You
want to know what General Shafter
did, not what he may have thought of
doing. If General Shafter has not re
peated the conversation, I ought not to
do so."
"As a matter of fact, he did not turn
the command over to you?" suggested
Governor Beaver, \o which General
Breckinridge responded:
"No, he did not, and I do not think
there is any impropriety in my saying
that he could not have done so."
With this the matter was allowed to
drop and General Breckinridge was ex
cused.
Dr. William G. Weaver of the Ninth
Pennsylvania Volunteers proved an im
portant witness. Dr. Weaver said that
typhoid had broken out about the 18th
of June, and that it had increased from
that time until the 20th of August.
There had been about 600 cases of this
disease in^the regiment and twenty
eight or thirty deaths. The doctor
said there was an insufficient supply of
drugs, and that at times he failed to
get what was needed. He said that
at one time there were flfty-six typhoid j
patients in the regimental hospital, be
cause there was no accomodation for
them in the division hospital. At an
other time there were sixty-seven fever
patients in the company tents, for
whom admission could not be secured
in any hospital, division or regimental.
In summing up the causes of dis
eases in the camp, Dr. Weaver includ
ed overwork of the men as one. He
also expressed the opinion that the
water from Chickamauga Creek was
polluted. He considered the water in
this stream as hardly fit to bathe in,
much less to drink.
gaged in the war had acted with zeal,
and every man had done the best of
which he was capable, and he had
never known a war in which there was
not criticism at the close of it.
Resuming his remarks of a general
character, General Breckinridge ex
pressed the opinion that there had not
been enough fighting to obscure other
results common to war. He thought
that the evils which had been experi
enced were inevitable under our Ameri
can system. He condemned this system
as most reprehensible and said the vol
unteer soldier must always suffer the
worst of the consequences.
"If the regular stands up under it bet
ter than the volunteer, it is only be
cause he has had time to adjust him
self to the unfavorable conditions."
He traced all the trouble to the want
of preparation and mobilization in time
of peace and that, in turn, to the failure
of Congress to appropriate the neces
sary money for reforms.
Replying to a question from Mr.
Woodbury, he said that, considering
the system, he thought the Government
"has done far better in its conduct of
the war than anybody had expected,
and just about one-fourth as well as
it should have done."
FORTHCOMING
MESSAGE OF
MR. McKINLEY
Much Will Be Left to
Congress.
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE FEW
NO STATED POLICY AS TO NEW
ACQUISITIONS.
Will Favor a Large Increase in the
Navy and the Revival of the
Grade of Admiral for
I>ewey.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Nov. 15.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent sends the
following: Those who have been ex
pecting President McKinley to make
specific recommendations in his annual
message to Congress as to the future
form of government of the territory
wrested from Spain will probably be
disappointed.
The message, now well under way,
will, I understand, point out that it is
too early yet to reach a decision in this
matter. The President appreciates that
Congress will desire to have a voice in
I shaping the policy in regard to the fu
| ture control of the Philippines and
! Porto Rico; that congressional com
j missions will probably be appointed to
; visit these new possessions and to in
vestigate and report upon the condi
tions in each island, and he is perfectly
willing that ample time should be al
lowed for all this to be done. It is his
purpose to have the conquered islands
continued under strong military gov
ernment pending a definite conclusion
by the executive and Congress as to the
future of these islands. He considers
it will take at least a year to enable
the American people to determine what
our relations should be toward the new
SITE OF THE NEW TERMINAL, OF THE VALLEY ROAD.
possessions. That the Islands may be
kept out of politics as much as possi
ble it is his purpose to have all islands
governed by military forces, and with
this idea in view army officers will be
assigned to perform all civil as well
as military functions.
The President will not recommend
any legislation affecting the tariff and
currency systems of Cuba, Porto Rico
or the Philippines. It is the present
purpose of the administration to allow
these recent possessions of Spain to re
main under military control for at least
a year, during which time the relations
which the islands are to bear to the
United States can be settled and all
their needs and conditions carefully
considered.
It is said that in the meantime there
will be no changes in regard to cur
rency or tariffs, for while the newly
acquired territor"- is under military
control, the President, as commander
in-chief of the army and navy, is an
absolute autocrat, and by military or
ders can institute new financial and
revenue systems at will. By this course
the administration will keep the sub
ject of currency and bank reform be
fore the country until the first meet
ing of the Fifty-sixth Congress, with
its Republican majority in both houses,
when the task of correcting the evils
of the present monetary system will be
taken up in earnest.
Revenfle revision is not to be recom
mended to Congress by the President
or the Secretary of the Treasury. The
expenditures of the Government are
now far in excess of the receipts, and
will probably continue to be so for some
time even after the formal conclusion
of peace with Spain. Secretary Gage
will advise some minor amendments to
the war revenue law, chiefly of an ad
ministrative character, but the whole
subject of revision of the currency to
conform to the changed situation of the
country will be left for the next Con
gress, when it will be more definitely
known what the situation will be.
The army reorganization will con
template at least 100,000 men. There
is no reason to believe that any recom
mendation will be made as to a dif
ferent basis of organization, that in
force now being considered compact
and complete and satisfactory. But a
departure will be made as relates to
what is recommended touching the
army in Cuba and the use to be made
of the native army, with a gradual ;id
mixture of Cuban troops with United
States troops. This will involve, ac
cording to the recommendation, the or
ganization of a regiment on the island
on a basis at first of one battalion of
Cuban troops to two battalions cf

Company slip No. 28, lying to the
east of Main-s:reet wharf
and west of the space now occupied by
the two floating drydocks. as a freight
terminal for its line. This action on
the part of the commissioners means
the consummation of one of the largest
railroad deals that has taken place in
this State.
Recently the Atchison, Topeka and
Santa Fe Railwa/ purchased the San
Francisco and San Joaquin Valley
Railway, and it was through the latter
road that the application was made to
the Harbor Commissioners for the priv
ilege of a terminal. Yesterday at the
regular meeting, of the commissioners
Captain A. H. Payson appeared on be
half of the Valley road and presented
the following communication:
SAN FRANCISCO, Cal.. Nov. 15. 1898.
The State Board of Harbor Commis
sionersâGentlemen: The San Francisco
and San Joaqutn Valley Railway Com
pany has made arrangements for the pur
chase on the water front of block 328, be
tween Main and Spear streets, together
with certain adjoining property, and de
sires to use the same for the handling of
both incoming and outgoing freight upon
the completion of its line to San Fran
cisco, which will be about September 1
next. To enable it to use this property
for the handling of loaded cars, this com
pany respectfully makes application for
an assignment from the above named
date of t'h# slip lying to the east of Main
street wharf and west of the space now
occupied by the two floating drydocks.
We also desire to make application for
the construction of a suitable approach
and apron for the transfer of cars from
fi.oats to the southern front of the prop
erty described.
We transmit herewith a sketch show
ing in a general way the arrangements
proposed, which is submitted for the con
sideration of the board.
The officers of this company will wait
upon you for such further explanations as
you may desire. Very respectfully.
A. H. PAYSON,
Second Vice President.
After the communication had been
read President Colnon said that the
board wouid be happjf to comply with
the request of the Valley road, but toat
as its line would not be completed uktil
next September he thought some later
date would be more suitable for the
consideration of the matter. Mr. Pay
son was then heard. He said that of
course the Valley road would be satis
fied with the assurance of the com
missioners that its request would be
United States troops.
When sufficient progress will have
been made toward a stable government
two battalions of Cuban troops will be
the proportion to each regiment, leav
ing only one of United States troops.
Thus the United States troops will
finally practical!}- disappear from the
island, when it shall be deemed safe
for the purposes of American interests
and of stable government in Cuba for
the United States troops to be gradu
ally supplanted by native regiments.
It is believed that the programme
outlined here, together with that for
the other islands, will call for the ser
vice ,of at least 100,000 men.
There is reason to believe that the
President will make highly compli
mentary references in his message to
the record-made by the navy during the
late war, and, it is expected, wiu briefly
state the events in which it played such
an important part. He will indorse the
recommendation of Secretary Long for
a revival of the grade of admiral for
the benefit of Rear Admiral Dewey,
and it is expected will also urge a
strong increase of the navy along the
lines to be recommended by Secretary
Long. The Secretary has talked over
the increase feature of his report -with

granted, but that inasmuch as it con
templated a large purchase of water
front property he would prefer that the
commissioners should take some formal
action immediately. President Colnon
readily acceded to this and on a mo
tion of Mr. Harney the request as em
bodied in the letter of the railway com
pany was unanimously granted.
Behind this simple transaction there
is a atory of real estate purchase and
of increased business for the city that
has quietly assumed large and sub
stantial proportions. The Santa Fe
people have virtually purchased thirty
lots on the "water front between Spear
and Main streets as the site for the
terminal to their line. While the for
mal transfer of the property has not
taken place sufficient amount of the
purchase price has been paid to bind
the transaction. Twenty-four of the
lots are contained in block 328, bounded
by Spear, Main. Harrison and Bryant
streets. The remainder of the lots ad
join this block. The latter is now oc
cupied by Haslett & Bailey's Hatha
way warehouses and has an area of
550x275 feet. William Martin and John
Ballard, well-known capitalists, are the
owners of the property.
A. H. Payson represented the presi-
I dent, E. P. Ripley, of the Santi Fe road
I in the deal, which was made last Fri
day by Thomas Magee. The purchase
price is said to have been in the neigh
borhood of $450,000, and of this, as has
been stated, enough has been paid to
bind the option on the part of the rail
way company.
The plan of the Santa Fe people is
a simple one. They propose to transfer
their freight cars on barges from their
terminal at Point Richmond and the
new wharf. Tugboats will be used for
this purpose. This is set forth in the
letter to the commissioners as the re
quest is made to be allowed to build a
suitable approach and apron for the
transfer of the cars. It is understood
that the option obtained some time ago
by the Valley road on the China basin
property as a result of this new deal
will be abandoned.
The cost to the State of partially fill
ing in slip No. 28 for the use of the
Santa Fe people will be about $20,000,
and this work will be commenced next
June, so that it will be ready by the
time the railway completes its line.
The Santa Fe Company will spend
many thousands of dollars In building
their terminal. They will put in a
double line of tracks running from the
bridge of the slip to their yards, where
will be innumerable tracks for the ac
commodation of the cars.

that he had not definitely determined
just how many ships he would ask Con

MAJORITY OF THE
SPORTS FAVOR CORBETT
NEW YORK, Nov. 15.-â Opinions of sporting men on the result of
the approaching twenty-round bout between Jim Corbett and Tom
Sharkey at the Lenox Athletic Club on November 22 show what a
great amount of interest is b^ing taken in this battle. While the
majority of those interviewed so far favor Corbett to beat the sailor,
the latter is constantly gaining friends. The opinions gathered are
as follows:
Kid McCoyâ The rules under which the men are to box prohibit
hitting in the clinches and on breakaways, which gives Corbett a de
cided advantage. I therefore think he will get the decision and the
bout will probably go the limit.
Tom O'Rotirkeâ l think the bout will go the limit and Sharkey
will get the decision.
George Considine â Corbett will surely win inside of fifteen rounds.
Charley "Whiteâ l cannot sop how Corbett can lose. He should
beat the sailor in seven or eight rounds.
Billy Gray â If Sharkey keeps his head and does not lose on a
foul he ought to win inside of nine rounds.
Sam Austinâ l think it will be an exceptionally clever fight and
if Corbett can stand off the sailor's rushes for twenty rounds I think
he will win.
Billy Newman â Corbett, on account of his great cleverness, should
win in fifteen rounds.
Al Hereford â Corbett will win the fight inside of ten rounds.
Sam Fitzpatrick â My prediction is that the contest will last twenty
rounds and Corbett will receive the verdict.
Connie McVey â Corbett will win, without doubt, in fifteen rounds.
Mike Dwyerâ Corbett should get the decision.
Gus Ruhlinâ While I have never seen Corbett box I think he is
clever enough to win the decision.
Bob Hilliardâ l think Corbett will get the decision.
Al Smithâ Corbett ought to get the decision. Sharkey will give
him a hard battle, however.

more explicit on the subject of Anglo-
French relations than any of his col
leagues in the Cabinet has been, said
it was the hope of every friend of peace
that the French withdrawal from Fa
ehodu was indicative of their accept
ance of the principle of British control
of the whole valley of the Nile, "re
garding which there cannot be any dis
cussion whatever."
Going on to recite a "series of un
friendly acts perpetrated by Franca in
other quarters of the globe during the
last ten or fifteen years," he said:
"If better relations are to be estab
lished it vfill be necessary for French
politicians to abandon tactics whose
object has been to embarrass British
policies in quarters where the French
have no interests to protect. I refer es
pecially to Newfoundland, where, de
spite the fact that the French fishery
Interests have declined to a compara
tively insignificant point, the demands
of the French have continually in
creased, and their interference with the
development of this colony has im
creased.
"At the present moment Newfound
land is seriously suffering from an in
tervention which is of no advantage to
France, although a serious detriment
to the British colony. If the Fashoda
Incident only serves to disabuse foreign
Etatesmen of the erroneous conception
that the British will yield anything to
pressure, it will be a blessing in dis
guise."
After referring to the "thorough and
complete sympathy so noticeable be
tween the mother country and her col
onies," Mr. Chamberlain continued as
follows:
"What is of equal consequence, our
American kin (loud cheers) have begun
to understand us better. If we have
had differences in Ihe past, I believe
they have arisen entirely from the want
of proper mutual understanding, but
now the Americans know that in the
late irouble our hearts went out to
them (cheers), and they heartily re-
Diprocate our feelings.
"I shall not attempt to predict what
may follow this better feeling, but I
may at least hope that in the future
the understanding of which we have
spoken may be perfected, and that in
the face of that understanding we two
may be able to guarantee peace and
civilization to the world." (Prolonged
cheers.)

SUPREME COURT
REARS TWO CASES
Murderer Hoff's Appeal
Argued.
TAKEN UNDER ADVISEMENT
LOS ANGELES RATE DECISION
CONSIDERED.
Conflicting Claims of the City and
the Monopoly Presented by
Senator White and J.
S. Chapman.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Nov. 15.â Before the
Supreme Court to-day motions were
heard and argued in two important
cases. One was that of George Hoff,
undtr sentence of death for the murder
of Mrs. Mary E. Clute in Ban Francisco
on December 15 last year. The other
was in the case in which the city cor
poration of Los Angeles and the water
works company of that place are in
volved.
The motion in tae case of -ioff was
presented and argued by William H.
Schooler on behalf of the appellant and
Deputy Attorney General C. N. Post on
behalf of the State. Schooler sought to
show that Judge Carroll Cook had
erred in rejecting certain instructions
which the attorney desired to have read
to the jury. Schooler argued that the
instructions were a copy of a decision
rendered by Justice Baldwin and con
curred in by Stephen J. Field when the
latter was Chief Justice of this State.
The instruction related to the subject
of motive. Hoff was sentenced on April
5 to be hanged June 10, but the appeal
which was argued to-day operated to
arrest execution of the death sentence.
It is now believed that Hoff, even if the
Supreme Court refuses to order a new
trial, will not be resentenced until next
spring, since it will be some months
before the papers in the present matter
are handed down.
Senator Stephen M. White and J. S.
Chapman of Los Angeles appeared in
the water case, known as the Los An
geles rate case. The case deals with
conflicting claims of the city and the
Los Angeles Water Company relative
to the right to collect charges for
water from the citizens of Los Angeles
and relative also to the power of the
lower court to appoint a receiver. The
sum of $27,000 a month represents the
income affected by the litigation. The
company claims that the city cannot
take possession of the water works un
til payment has been made for the im
provements which have been construct
ed by the company since 1868. The
lower court decided that the ~ity could
not take possession without paying for
the works, but nevertheless appointed
a receiver. The city is now appealing
from the former feature of the decision
and the company from the latter.
John Scott and City Attorney Dunn
conducted the arguments on behalf of
the city. The matter was taken under
advisement by the court.
MRS. STEVENS HONORED.
Elected President of the Woman's
Christian Temperance Union.
ST. PAUL, Minn., Nov. 15.â The storm
of yesterday in the Woman's Christian
Temperance Union convention caused a
small attendance at the convention to
day. The election of officers was pre
ceded by the singing of "Guide Me, Oh
Thy Great Jehovah." Mrs. Stevens was
elected president On the first ballot, and
made a touching speech of acceptance,
urging all to join in carrying on the work
to which Miss Willard, the beloved lead
er, had given her life. The Maine dele
gation presented her with a beautiful
cluster of roses.
Mrs. Stevens then stated she wanted to
nominate Miss Anna A. Gordon, who had
been Miss Willard's private secretary,
and is probably one or the most beloved
of the union leaders, to be vice-president
at large. The by-laws were then amend
ed to give the president the authority to
make such nomination, and it was im
mediately made, the election following by
a rising unanimous vote.
For corresponding secretary Mrs. S. H.
Frey of Minnesota received 204 votes out
of 353. Mra. Clara C. Hoffman of Mis
souri wa? re-elected recording secretary.
Mrs. Frances E. Beauchamp of Ken
tucky wa - made assistant recording sec
retary. T.Â». ââ¢ ballot for treasurer resulted:
Mrs. Helf>n M. Barker, 285; Mrs. M. H.
Dunham, 41; scattering, 20.
The Temple matter came up again in
the convention this afternoon and a reso
lution indorsing 1 the Temple was defeated
by a vote of 76 to 277.

GILROY. Nov. 15.â The marriage of
Richard M. Ryan, Gilroy's popular post
master, and Miss Kate Schafer, the
charming daughter of Mr. and Mrs.

Father Hudson. The church was a
bower of smilax, ferns, ivy and potted
flowers and plants. The sacred edifice
was filled with relatives and friends of
the couple. After the ceremony a wed
ding breakfast was partaken of. Mr. and
Mrs. Ryan left for Ban Francisco this

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER lfi, 1898.
HARES GIVE THEIR
FOES HARD RUNS
Exciting- Coursing Near
Merced.
ALL CONDITIONS FAVORABLE
WEATHER FAIR AND THE GAME
FULL OF LIFE.
Besults of the First Round of the All-
Aged Stake, and How the Con
tests Were Lost and
Won.
BY M. J GEARY.
MERCED, Nov. 15.â The weather for
the inaugural day's meeting of the
Ingleside Coursing Club on the far
famed plains of Merced was cool and
decidedly enjoyable. The attendance
was very large â in fact teams sufficient
to accommodate the seekers of first
class sport could not be obtained at any
price at 7 o'clock this morning. The
start from Merced to the happy cours
ing grounds was made soon after the
innner man was refreshed by a good
morning's breakfast, and, although the
roads leading to the feeding and play
ing fields of the highly conditioned
jacks were dusty in places, the drive to
and from the coursing was enjoyed by
all.
The coursing commenced immediately
after the president of the club had ad
dressed the meeting 1 , and read parts of
the riot act to the unruly and ungov
ernable. Hares of the "never known to
quit when running" variety were found
ad libitum, and as a consequence there
are many quiet and docile dogs housed
in their kennels as I write. Courses of
from two to five miles were many, and
in most instances the hares showed
considerable disrespect for the dogs by
parting company with them at times
when fur was muchly needed. The
ground coursed over was of short stub
ble â sandy surface that is not desirable
for coursing, although a good shower
would have made it admirable for the
sport. The game was so strong of foot
and limb that in most instances the
d"gs only scored wrenches until they
had got well out of sight of the specta
tors.
It must be remembered that ihe de
scriptive account of each course which
follows is given from an observer's
point of view; i. c., while dogs and hare
were in sight of those who sat in ve
hicles. Of course, after they had passed
out of sight the report ended, although
the scores were kindly given by Judge
Grace through his field assistant, T. J.
MoHugh.
First round of all-ace stake, prizes
$500. $250, two of $125 each, four of tib and
eight of $37 50 each. Results:
Johnny R vs. Las Palmasâ Las Palmas
led well to the hare, but when the game
changed its course Johnny R forced to the
front and held his quarry well in hand, so
to speak, until after a long run the hare
sought safety by dashing into a squirrel
hole. Las Palmas waa close up with her
opponent whÂ»en the course ended. Win
ner, Johnny R. Score, 7 to 1.
Miss Alice vs. Senoritaâ Senorita led to
t the hare by several lengths and kept the
lead for a long distance, in fact until the
I dogs and hare got our of sight. At the
finish Mips Alice was leading. Neither
dog got close enough to work the came
in coursing-park fashion. Winner,. Senor
ita. Score, 8 to 2.
Mayflower vs. Inna â The hare jumped
within five yards of the dogs and sat
! down just as the dogs were slipped. Irma
led and made a drive to kill but missed.
The hare then got down to business and
I ran like a streak for 300 yards. Irma was
first to score a wrench and turn; then
Mayflower got in and was leading Irma
i w r hen the dogs were lost to view in the
dust; a very long course. Winner, Irma.
Score, 8 to 4.
White Diamond vs. Jesse Mooreâ Jesse
was first to the hare by four lengths.
' Then White Diamond drew close up, but
i Jesse kept in the lead on a long, straight
I run of fully half a mile, when White
Diamond by a grand burst of speed made
a go-bye and was leading when the
hare passed over a hill and out of sight.
Winner, White Diamond. Score, 10 to 6.
Orpheum Lass vs. Kitty Scottâ-Or
pheum Lass led to the hare, which fa
vored her. but neither dog got near
enough to score even a wrench until they
got lost in the distance from view. Win
ner, Orpheum Lass. Score, 18 to 0; which
shows that the Lass had things all her
own way in the latter part of the course.
Jennie Wilson vs. Florence Nâ The hare
jumped in front of the leading teams and
turned off his line when the dogs were
slipped and then ran into the dust kicked
up by the horses. The course could not
be seen from the teams until the dogs
"were far in the distance. Then Florence
was fast making up for lost ground.
Winner, Jennie Wilson. Score, 34 to 24.
Rusty Gold had a bye with Las Palmas.
Las Palmas, notwithstanding her hard
course with Johnny R, ran well up with
Rusty Gold from start to finish. Winner,
Rusty Gold. Score, 21 to 9.
Tuolumne .vs. Quickstitchâ Qulckstitch
led to the hare and scored quite a few
times, and was apparently having things
all her own way when the Merced dog
suddenly opened up and shot by his op
ponent, driving the hare at great speed
and scoring fast. He held the lead all
through the balance of the course, out
scoring Quickstitch until the kill. The
course was in full view of the spectators.
Winner, Tuolumne. Score, 15 to 8.
Sweet Music vs. Mialmo â When the dogs
were slipped the hare suddenly changed
Its course, favoring Sweet Music, but
Mialmo, having the greatest speed, shot
to the front and was first to score. She
made quite a number of points before
Quickstitch got in, and the dogs were
running neck and neck as they passed out
of view into low ground. Winner, Sweet
Music. Score, 12 to 8.
Pet Klrby vs. Idaâ All bets wsre de
clared off on this race by the stewards,
as Ida was said to be not feeling well for
some reason not stated. Ida led from slips
and ran well, notwithstanding her condi
tion. She had her game well in charge
and scored several wrenches until after
covering half a mile of ground. Then Pet
Kirby got in and scored a point. The
dogs then ran out of sight of the crowd
and coursed the hare several miles. Win
ner, Ida. Score, 17 to 1.
Master Jack vs. Matchlessâ Both dogs
got away to a good slip and ran neck and
neck to the hare, which crossed over a
mound and was quickly lost to the sight
of the spectators. Winner.^Matchless.
Score, 14 to 4. â¢
Rosle R. vs. Willfulâ Willful had just
arrived from Denver and was consequent
ly not in condition for a hard course.
Rosie R. led from slips and opened up a
big gap to the hare. She held a good lead
until dogs and hare were lost to view.
Willful killed. Winner, Rosie R. Score,
12 to 2.
Glen Rosa vs. Pat Malloyâ This was a
good slip and a close run to the hare, but
after passing over a mound. Pat Malloy
made the turn. Then Glen Rosa passed to
the front, driving her game at great speed
on a straight run for a half mile before
a turn was scored. Pat Malloy was then
several lengths behind. The hare made
for and got to a wire fence near Merced
River, which It got under. The dogs
also crossed the fence and Glen Rosa was
holding a good lead when lost to view.
Winner, Glen Rosa. Score, 13 to 4.
Sunolite vs. Gladiator â Gladiator led to
the hare and quickly scored a wrench and
two turns, after which the hare put on a
burst of speed and ran the dogs quite a
distance before Gladiator scored again, al
lowing Sunolite to get in for a few points.
The hare carried the dogs to a wire fence,
after which the course was lost sight of
as far as the spectators could see. Win
ner. Gladiator. Score, 18 to 10.
Old Glory vs. Revolverâ Old Glory led
to the hare and scored first turn, after
which he made two wrenches. The game
then swerved and crossed the field within
full view of the onlookers. Then Old
Glory slackened in his pace and Revolver
passed him and held a lead until lost in
the dust and the distance. Winner, Old
Glory. Score 12 to 2. , .
White Rocket vs. Nellie B.â Nellie B. led
to game and hare swerved, favoring
White Rocket, who held the winning po
sition until lost to view. Winner, White
Rocket. Score sto 0. . , . , .
Gilt Edge vs. Beautyâ Gilt Edge led, but
was passed by Beauty after the hare
had changed its course. Beauty scored a
few times then held the lead for quite
a long distance, the hare gradually leav
ing the dog-s behind. Beauty finally stop
ped running, leaving her opponent to
chase the game as he pleased. Not hav
ing got near enough to the hare to score,
the judge gave the course to Beauty.
Winner, Beauty. Score, 10 to 2.
Jean Bereaud vs. Benicia Boyâ Benlcia
Boy led from slips and the hare carried
the dogs out of sight of the crowd be
fore a turn was scored. Winner, Benicia
Boy. Score, 10 to 0.
Montana vs. Silkwoodâ The dogs were
slipped in bad ground, which again shut
out the view of the spectators, Montana
led and took possession right away, but
after scoring a few times Silkwood got in
for place and was leading when last seen
at quite a distance from the cavalcade.
Winner, Silkwood. Score, 13 to 5.
Jimmy Rix vs. Victor Queenâ Victor
Queen ran a splendid course, working her
game splendidly all around the teams in
a wide circle 'and finally pressing her
game so hard that the hare sought safety
by dodging into a squirrel hole just as
the Queen was about to score a kill. Win
ner, Victor Queen. Score, 26 to 1.
Dauntless vs. Fleet Wingsâ Fleet Win^s
was first to the hare and wrenched. Then
Dauntless took charge and made several
wicked drives to kill but failed until the
game carried them quite a distance.
Winner. Dauntless. Score, 18 to 1.
Decision vs. Flashlightâ This was Flash
light's course nearly all through. In the
early part of the race it looked as if a.
kill would result at any moment, but
when the hare realized that fooling meant
danger to him he spread his long legs
and gave the dogs a merry run over miles
of country. Decision quit after traveling
until all hope failed. Winner, Flashlight.
Score. 12 to 2.
Get There vs. Rocklln Belleâ This was a
very pretty course, but as the dogs were
of the same color, it was hard to "keep a
line on their respective performances.
Rockiin Belle led and worked her game
beautifully, scoring several points and be
ing ably assisted by Get There, who also
came in for a good share of points near
the finish of one of the prettiest courses
of the day. Winner, Rocklin Belle.
Score, 20 to 14.
ABC vs. Lady Jane â The course was
obscured by a cloud of dust from the
teams. Winner. Lady Jane. Score 24 to 0

dense that it was almost impossible to see

tnoy were slipped. Sportsman led from
slips to game, after which Judge Grace
had an exclusive view of the course.
Y\ inner, Patria. Score. 7 to 0.
Dakota vs. Royal Prizeâ Royal Prize
was first to score a turn and a wrench !
and was in possession of his game for i
quite a distance, when Dakota was seen :
in close company and assisting in the
chase. Winner, Royal Prize. Score 32
to 6.
Rose of Tralee vs. Sarcasticâ This was
the most exciting course of the day. The
race was short and both dogs scored
equal points. The judge signaled "no
go, ' and in the run-off Sarcastic won by
a very small margin. Winner, Sarcastic.
Score, 3â3 and 5â3.

BATTLE BETWEEN
IMMUNES AND

Six Lives Lost in the
Conflict.
SOLDIERS RESISTED ARREST
WERE DRUNK AND ATTEMPTED
TO STEAL A HOG.
General Wood Visits San Luis, the
Scene of the Slaughter, and
Will Promptly Mete Out
Punishment.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1898, by James Gor
don Bennett.
SANTIAGO, Nov. 15.â San Luis was
the scene last night of a fatal encoun
ter between rural guards and intoxi
cated soldiers of the Ninth Immunes,
Twenty-third Kansas and Eighth Illi
nois, in which Sergeant Rafael Ferer,
chief of the Provisional Mounted Po
lice, one of the guards, one negro of
the Ninth Immunes, Jose Ramon; a
planter, Emilio Bettern, and a child
were killed.
the disturbance was caused by an at
tempt of the soldiers to steal a hog be
longing to the Cubans, who protested.
It was pay day and a large number of
soldiers were intoxicated, all joining in
the fight.
Sergeant Ferer and his men, in reply
to a call, soon reached the house where
the thieves were, but they escaped and
were joined by twenty companions
armed with Springfield rifles taken
from camp contrary to orders. The
fight began in a house near the Norma
estate, continuing on the way toward
the house of the manager of the es
tate.
Ferer's companions barricaded them
selves while Ferer remained outside ex
postulating with the negroes and try
ing to persuade them to desist. He
was shot through the head, dying after
staggering to the door and ordering his
men to defend themselves and the lives
of the people on the estate. The police
fired from cover, killing one soldier and
wounding several. Two of the police
men were shot while attempting to es
cape. Ramon and Battern were shot
while trying to disperse the soldiers.
The officers of the regiments deny that
their soldiers did the shooting, against
incontrovertible evidence to the con
trary.
General Wood and Captain Beacon
visited San Luis this morning to
investigate. They found the wounds
were made by 45-caliber bullets. They
acted promptly, offering a reward of
$1000 in gold for disclosure of the iden
tity of the men implicated in the shoot
ing. General Wood returned to-day,
cabling the details to Washington to
night, with recommendations that im
mediate punishment should follow.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., Nov. 15.
The steamship Centennial of the Se- ;
attle and Honolulu line arrived this
morning, bringing additional details of
the misfortunes of the steamship
Columbia of the same line. The Colum- '
bia was placed on the Seattle-Honolulu â 
route and on her arrival at Honolulu j
she was covered with libel suits. After i
much delay the libels were temporarily
Batisfied and the vessel started on the
return voyage October 29. From the i
time she left port defects were being
found among various parts of her ma- \
chlnery which kept the engineering de- !
partment busy fixing them, and the !
pumps commenced giving uut one at a
time. To add to these misfortunes a
â  heavy northeast wind sprung up, the j
vessel rolled and pitched and the pas- j
eengers were tossed about like leaves, j
it being impossible to walk either on
deck or in the cabin. On November 31 j
the gale increased and it was found j
that a seam had opened amidships, that \
the steam pipes were straining badly I
end the vessel was being rilled with es- j
caping steam from the joints.
Investigation showed that water was
streaming in over the cement places on
the sides of the room opposite the en
gines and that the boilers had broken
loose from their cement foundations, j
Further Investigation revealed the fact j
that seven streams from six to eight j
inches wide and one inch in thickness
were pouring- in amidships and another
stream twelve inches wide was pouring
into the lire room. The condition of the |
vessel became critical and Captain 1
Milnor called the officers together for
consultation. Running for various
points was discussed and it was de
cided to make for Hiio. The vessel was
In latitude 26 degrees 14 minutes north,
400 miles from Hilo, when the order was
given to put about.
When the vessel turned the steam
steering gear broke and hand gear was
coupled on. The storm increased in
fury, two more seams opened in the
stern, and the one amidships was con
stantly growing larger. Another also
opened in the sleeve of the stern gear-
Ing through which the water was rush- j
Ing. The shaft had been knocked out
of place and was turning at an angle,
causing a friction which Â»heated the
â water coming through that part of the
vessel. The water-tight bulkheads in
the lower Hold separating the boiler and
engine-rooms from the fore and aft
compartments were torn loose. These
spaces would open and close with the
rolling of the vessel. So heavily did the
vessel labor that her backbone parted
amidships and it became h fight for life.
Boats were got in readiness for im
mediate use, and according to Captain
Milnor it seemed impossible to reach
port. Great coolness was displayed in
the engineers' de] ..rtm^nt, where the
bursting of the main steam pipe was
momentarily expected, which meant
death to all therein.
The Columbia finally reached Hllo in j
a sinking condition and the passengers
and crew were landed while the vessel
was gradually going to the bottom.
Several of the crew were severely in- |
jured. The passengers were transferred
to the Centennial and safely landed I
here. Captain Milnor has asked for a
survey of the steamer by the board of j
underwriters. The Columbia has had
bad luck ever since her advent on this
coast. She received injuries on the
South American coast, requiring ex
tensive repairs, which were not proper
ly made, I^aks being plastered up with
cement, and paintr-d so it was not no
ticeable to the underwriters' inspectors.
The vessel had been condemned by
the board of survey. She was valued
at about $100,000. was insured for $60,000,
and was owned principally by Alex
ander Baillie of Tacoma.

REVOLUTION IN
SAN SALVADOR
President Gutierrez Is a
Prisoner.
CAPTURED BY THE REBELS
BEVOLT MAY ASSUME SOME IM
PORTANCE.
Is Not Directed Against the Chief
Executive, but Against the
Confederation of Re
publics.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Nov. 15.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald tel
egraphs: A cablegram received at the
State Department from Acting Consul
Baruch at San Salvador confirms the
announcement of a revolution in Sal
vador. The message further states that
President Gutierrez has been taken
prisoner. No request for a warship is
made, but in view of the seriousness of
the situation it is probable that the
orders to the Philadelphia will be
changed so that she will start as soon
as possible for the Salvadorean coast,
or instructions will be given to the gun
boat \v heeling to proceed to La Liber
tad and provide protection for Ameri
can interests.
With the capture of the president of
the state, the revolution In Central
America usually ends, but this is not
likely to be th^ case, as Salvador is a
state in the Greater Republic of Cen
tral America, and Nicaragua and Hon
duras are required by the constitution
thereof to put down the rebellion. They
will probably restore Senor Gutierrez
to power. A diplomat familiar with the
situation in Central Ajnerica told me
to-night that the revolt was not par
ticularly directed against Senor Gutier
rez, but against the Greater Republic.
"There's a conservative party in Sal- j
vador," he said, "which is opposed to
the union and has taken advantage of
the fact that the republic is only two
weeks old to bring about a revolution
in order to discredit It in the eyes of
the world. President Gutierrez was a
conservative until recently and opposed
the entrance of Salvador into the union,
but the reports made by Salvadorean I
delegates to Congress showt I the ad- â 
vantages of the union and he changed
his ideas. Salvador is now like one of
the States of the United States. She
Is responsible to the federal govern
ment and this government will sup
press the revolution. Strong bodies of
troops can be sent into Salvador with
dispatch by Honduras and these
troops can be quickly reinforced from
Nicaragua.

Cook Still, outlaw, shot through the
right sh'nildor.
Sam Sixkiller, outlaw, shot in leg.
Harry King, outlaw, both arms shot
through.
Red Bird, full-blood Creek Indian,
shot in breast; will die.
Deputy Marshals Hendrix and James
were both shot in breast, and Will Par
ker, a citizen, was hit in the arm by a
stray bullet.
The battle began at daylight when
the train came in and was waged for a
half-hour. The outlaws came into
Chelsea about 3 o'clock In the morning.
Intending to rob the bank before any
one was awake and then hold up the
passenger train which arrives at Chel
sea at daylight.
Their plan to rob the bank succeeded,
but when they rode over to stop the
passenger train the outlaws were met
vith a heavy fire from police aboard
the train.
When the train came in the two Wil
liams boys and John Gourd jumped on
tht first passenger coach and started
through, while the others tackled the
express car.
Deputy Marshals and a posse of eight
men were in the smoker and opened
fire, killing the three outlaws who came
into the coach before the outlaws had a
chance to fire a shot.
The others started toward their po
nies. All the Marshals remained on
the coach, except Hendrix and James,
who jumped out and started to fol
low.
The four outlaws took refuge behind
their ponies and a battle waged for a
half hour. Finally all the outlaws
were so badly injured that they -
forced to surrender.

THE SAN FEANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 16, 1898.
SECRETARY OF STATE-ELECT.
CHARLES F- CURRY.
BRYAN ON THE
LATE ELECTION
Not a Sweeping Repub
lican Victory.
GAINS EQUALED BY LOSSES
QUESTIONS OVERSHADOWED BY
THE WAR.
Free Silver Coinage, He Says, Will
Again Be the Paramount Issue
After the Conclusion
of Peace.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LINCOLN, Neb., Nov. 15.â Colonel W.
J. Bryan to-night gave to the Asso
ciated Press the following interview
relative to the late election:
"While I do not understand that ser
vice in the volunteer army prevents a
soldier from expressing opinions upon
political questions, I declined to take
part in the late campaign lest I should
be accused by partisan opponents of
attempting to embarrass the adminis
tration. Now that the election is over
I shall exercise a privilege of discussing
the returns.
"Compared with the election of 1896
the Republicans have gained in some
places and lost in others. It was not a
sweeping Republican victory. On the
whole the result is not surprising when
it is remembered that the administra
tion is just concluding a successful
war. While a majority of the soldiers
are probably anti-Republican the man
agement of the war has been entirely in
Republican hands, and the strongest
argument used during the campaign
was that a Republican defeat would
discredit V. \ President in the eyes of
foreign nations.
"It was not a trail upon the issues
now before the people, but a successful
plea for a continuance of the case. The
people have not accepted the gold
standard; they have not fallen in love
with the plan to give the banks a mo
nopoly of the issue of paper money;
they have not decided to retire the
greenbacks; they have not surrendered
to the trusts.
"These questions were forced into the
background by the declaration of war,
but they must be faced again as soon
las peace is restored. The Chicago plat
! form presents for public consideration
I certain vital, economic questions'. That
; platform has not been abandoned by
j those who indorsed it in 1896. It will be
' reaffirmed in 1900, because it gives cx
i pression to the hopes and aspirations
of a large majority of the party.
"When the Democrats, Populists and
j Silver Republicans favored -Ã¼ban ln
' dependence they understood that war
would give a temporary advantage to
the party in power, but they were will-
Ing to risk defeat in order to aid the
people fighting to be free.
"Neither can the election be regarded
i as an indorsement of any definite foiÂ«
! eign policy. Until a treaty of peace has
! been entered into and the terms made
known the people cannot pass judg
ment upon it. Whether the war will
raise any question of sufficient import
ance to turn public attention away
from domestic problems remains to be
seen."
In regard to the Nebraska election he
said: "A liglv. vote was cast in Ne
braska, but the fusionists have elected
\ the entire State ticket and carried the
same Congressional districts that they
carried in 1896. If Senator Allen is de
' feated for re-elertion it will be because
Hf-nators are elected by legislators in-
I stead at by the people. If a Republican
i Senator is chosen by the next Legisla
ture he will go to Washington to repre
sent a minority of the people of the
State and to thwart the will of the
majority."
TWO SANTA CRTTZANS DEAD.
Alexander Russell and Louis M. Cox
Pass Away.
SANTA CRUZ, Nov. 15.â Alexander
Russell died suddenly at 10:30 o'clock this
morning at Watsonvllle from heart dis
ease. He left this city yesterday after
noon for Watsonville on business. He
was a member of the Society of Pioneers
and had resided since early days lift this
city. He was a man of means, owning
among other valuable property, the Rus
set] Tract, where all the State militia en
campments were held, and was also a
large stockholder in the City Bank. He
was a native of Ireland and 58 years old.
Louis M. Cox, one of the old settlers,
died this morning at the age of 70 years.
He waa a native of New York,
GLOOMY OUTLOOK
FOR MRS. BOTKIN
Many Witnesses Coming
From Delaware.
DUNNING TO BE AMONG THEM
SAYS HE WILL SHOW UP THE
FEMALE FIEND.
Attorney General White Will Per
sonally Assist at the Trial and
Is Confident of Con
viction.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WILMINGTON, Del., Nov. 15.âAt
torney General Robert C. White to
night announced that he would go to
California to personally assist in the
trial of Mrs. Cordelia Botkin. The thir
teen witnesses from Delaware and the
Attorney General will leave in time to
be present at the opening of the trial.
Among the witnesses from Delaware
will be John P. Dunning, the husband
of one of the murdered women. Dun
ning talked freely of his trip to-day.
He said:
"It will be frightfully unpleasant, and
I shall be put in a bad light, I know,
but I'll show that female fiend up with
out any mercy. It is easier for a man
to have his past life thrown before the
public presence in a distant country. I
might have hesitated had it been here,
but there nothing shall be held back."
Dunning expressed a firmer opinion
than ever that Mrs. Botkin was the
slayer of his wife, although he consid
ered her trial in California a farce, and
that the only place for speedy justice
to be done was Delaware.
Asked what defense the California
woman intended to lean upon, Dunning
intimated that her strongest defense
was to further fight a trial. He had
no fear either for himself or for the
safety of the case as to what the wo
man intended to bring out.
"Of course," he added, "she will not
spare me, and I am very willing that
nothing should be spared."
Attorney General White explained
how the authorities intend to allow
Mrs. Botkin *. > loupholo for escape. No
technicalities â  f the law will save the
woman now. Should one jury disagree
she will be tried and retried. Should
she be acquitted the authorities will
then put her on trial for the murder of
Mrs. Deane, and having gotten a
glimpse of the defense she makes can
surely gain a conviction. This failing,
the appeal from the California Supreme
Court will be taken through the Federal
court and the accused woman will then
be tried for the double murder, which,
not being the same offense as either 01
the former causes, will not place her
life in jeopardy twice, as the constitu
tion prohibits.
Detective McVey, who is one of the
thirteen witnesses, will be sent on in
advance, to be ready at any moment
with his Federal court appeal or to
thwart any motive to prevent or delay
a trial or secure the release of the al
leged wholesale poisoner.
LIVELY RAILROAD RIVALRY.
Two Competing Lines Being Located
Up in Idaho.
PORTLAND. Or.. Nov. 15.â A special to
the Oregon ian from Lewiston, Idaho,
says:
The Northern Pacific and Oregon Rail
road and Navigation Company are locat
ing lines in the Nez Perce country, Idaho.
Appearances Indicate a lively contest be
tween the two companies, it looks as if
there will be plenty of railroad building
in the North Pacific Coast States this sea
son. The Northern Pacific is the aggres
sor. The Navigation Company is sup
posed to be backed by the Union Pacific
and the Great Northern, and the con
test promises to be a lively one. It looks
as if dividends will go into the new rail
lines instead of to the stockholders.

SITISUN, Cal., Nov. 15.â Charles I^am
brecht, son of Ludwig I,ambrfK"ht of

evening, when the body was found by

LEARNED A LESSON.
The Poolrooms Paid Thompson Tick
ets and Are Now Regret
ting the Fact.
The latest returns which have turned
the tables in the Curry and Thompson
fight have taught the proprietors of the
large poolrooms of the city a lesson they
will not forget in a hurry. The first re
turns from the State fight gave Thomp
son for Secretary of State a safe ma
jority over Curry, and as this impression
was allowed to remain for several days
it became almost an established fact that
the Democratic candidate had succeeded
where his less successful colleagues had
failed. The Call yesterday published the
fact that the table of fignres furnished

UIB 1111*11 Â»'Â»"â  â¢ . .
Mr HiiNRY. I have been troubled a long time with what I suppose
' they call dyspepsia. I call it ind!gestion. I have
had <reat pain in my chest for many years, and I
used to have difficulty in breathing at times, and
feel as if something had stuck in my throat, especially
after eating, and I always had to be careful what I
ite I dared not eat pastry or hot rolls, and at twnej
{ would get dizzy in my head. I tried Pepsm and
other patent medicines, and I did not find much
benefit until the man at the drug store wnexe I deal
asked me to try Ripans Tabules. . did, and I tdlyoa
I felt more benefit from one box of Ripans Tatro*Â»
than aH the other stuff I had been taking. I hadaboat
three or four boxes, and I am cared. I don t have
the pain in my chest, my bowels are more tegular,
and I can eat any kind of food that is put before me.
<Ripans Tabules have made a good cure for me, and
\I tell you I tell all my friends to try them. -
by the Western Union Telegraph Com
pany were incorrect, and that instead of
Thompson being elected he had been de
feated by a plurality of over 4000 votes.
These are the facts in the case as they
have been revealed up to date, but it was
the first few days after the election,
when the election of Thompson seemed a
certainty, that the poolrooms began to
pay off" on these two candidates. The
State ticket seemed a sure thing as early
as last Tuesday night week, and when
Wednesday passed without anything be
ing received to upset the first figures, the
men who receive wagers for a considera
tion began to think it was a question of
a dead cock in the pit, so whenever a
man showed up with a Thompson ticket
he got the cash without any questions
being asked. The prominent poolroom
men are ashamed to own that they, who
are supposed to be onto a thing or two,
have been taken in, and are keeping their
losses a secret.- As a matter of fact, not
tion, but still there was enough
placed in this city on Curry
and Thompson to make a snug
sum. It means a dead loss to the men
who do the cashing, but they can't af
ford to kick because of the laugh that
they would get.
On the other hand, in many instances
those that held tickets on Curry destroy
ed them after the first returns seemed
such a certainty, and now they are kick
ing themselves for their simplicity.
Quite a number, however, held on to the
bits of pasteboards as souvenirs of their
lack of judgment, and like the wise men,
are now saying: "I told you so."
There is no Way of getting at the
amount that was paid out by the pool
rooms, but it\can be safely stated that
nearly all tickets held on Thompson were
cashed. It is reported that some Repub
licans, even after they received the first
returns, refused to believe that Curry had
been defeated and backed up their con
victions with the cash, so that now they
are giving the knowing smile to their
less wise brethren.

BOASTED THAT THE EXAMINER
AND CHRONICLE WERE BRIBED
Sherman Also Assured McDon
ald That Hart Had Been
Corrupted.
Officials and Newspapers Bought by the
Wreckers to Support the
Crumbling Banks.
The letters of Moses H. Sherman re
veal more, perhaps, of the terrible his
tory of the McDonald banks than any
other epistles ever written. In the doc
uments published this morning the
arch-conppiratur congratulates his con
federates that two of the morning
newspapers of this city, the Chronicle
and the Examiner, had been bribed and
need not be feared by the wreckers in
any way. This information Mr. Sher
man sent his associates to assure them
that in their manipulations they need
have no fear of unfavorable comment
in these newspapers. Sherman also
declared that Attorney General Hart
was in the camp of the conspirators
and was absolutely at their disposal for
anything they might demand. When
the letter referring to Hart was writ
ten Sherman, A. F. Johns, D. M. Tom
blln and others who surrounded the
McDonalds were in Sacramento to
lobby through the Legislature a bill for
the division of Fresno County.
The lobby thus established at the
State Capitol was a corrupt one. Hart,
as already indicated, was giving what-
THE CONSPIRATORS WERE "SOLID" WITH HART.
One of the most important letters written by M. H. Sherman had reference to
Ex-Attorney Genera! W. H. H. Hart, who was criminally in collusion with the
bank wreckers. In the early part of 1893, during the session of the Legislature,
Hart was in consultation with wreckers at Sacramento. In a letter to Dick
McDonald Sherman jubilantly declared that they were "solid" with Hart and
could congratulate themselves on the fact that he would remain in office for
two years longer. At that time the McDonalds had sent Sherman, Johns and
- others to the State Capitol to lobby through the Legislature a bill for the
division of Fresno County and the creation of Madera County.
ever assistance his official position
made it possible to command. Sher
man assured Dick McDonald that the
Southern Pacific Company would be
taken into the camp of the wreckers
and would exercise its influence in their
behalf. With these tremendous sources
of power, the Chronicle and the Exam-

Southern Pacific Company and a judl
ADVERTISEMENTS.
Pears'
Unless you have used Pears'
soap you probably do not know
what we mean by a soap with
no free fat or alkali in itâ noth-
ing but soap.
The more purely negative soap
)s, the nearer does it approach
clous expenditure of coin, the bank
wreckers planned their campaign and
succeeded.
They could rely upon the silence of
two newspapers, the collusion of a high
official of the State and the co-opera
tion of a great corporation. Sherman
indicates in these letters that he was
the chief manipulator in securing this
tremendous advantage for the dishon
est bankers. His letters necessarily are
of exceptional interest.
Sherman was not only fearful of the
blackmail of local papers, but feared
those in the southern part of the State.
He informed Dick that a great paper
in Southern California was about to
change hands, and he would have It so
arranged that the McDonalds could use
the paper for whatever purposes they
pleased. Incidentally Sherman re
marked that it Had cost him a great
deal of money to keep the City Council
of Phoenix from interfering with hia
schemes and projects. In these let
ters this man discusses blackmail, brib
erj-, official corruption and private dis
honesty as simple business propositions,
in which he takes part without the
slightest disturbance to his conscience.
He saw immorality only in the efforts
of any one to secure money from him.
That seemed to have been the only
offense he understood and he bordered
on hysteria when he discovered that a
man to whom he had already given
$1000 demanded $1400 more. In Mr.
Sherman's code of ethics, as revealed
in his remarkable letters, It was a
stroke of shrewd business policy and
highly commendable to corrupt the At
torney General of this State, to buy
the silence of newspapers and to bribe
City Councils. It is probable that in
the history of great events on this
coast, in affairs that involved millions
of dollars and the reputations of prom
inent men, there is no parallel to these
letters. While Sherman discussed his
own corrupt methods he found time to
dream of fabulous wealth in new yen*
tures, and he suggested to Dick Mc-
Donald the absurd project of floating
five million of dollars of bonds on the
London market.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 16, 1898.
OF INTEREST TO PACIFIC AND PEOPLE'S HOME
SAVINGS DEPOSITORS.
When The Call began the first complete exposure and
disclosure of the crimes and offenses which wrecked the
Pacific Bank and robbed thirteen thousand depositors in
the People's Home Savings Bank it said expressly that it
was not for any purpose of newspaper sensation, but to
vindicate the general soundness of our financial institutions
which withstood the panic of 1893 and to point to the de
spoiled depositors a way to partial recovery of their
losses.
The Call is in possession of proof which makes it pos
sible for those depositors to better themselves. The Call
has evidence to prove that conveyance of property and as
sets belonging to the wrecked banks is vitiated by fraud
and it is at the disposal of- the robbed depositors if they
will put their interests in the hands of any legal represen
tative who can communicate with this paper.
This evidence will be published in its proper order,
and The Call makes this announcement in order that it may
inure to the interests of the depositors and not to the ad=
vantage of speculators in their misfortunes.
sion of Fresno County and the creation
of a county of Madera. This division
of the county was made at the session
of the Legislature in 1893, and Dick Mc-
Donald sent several of his parasites to
Sacramento to lobby in favor of divi
sion. It was believed that if the coun,
ty of Madera was created, the town of
Madera would be made the county seat
and the McDonald interests there and
the John Brown crlony would be great
ly enhanced in value. Among the par
asites who went to Sacramento was M.
H. Sherman, who promised that he
would secure the co-operation of
Fourth and Townsend streets with th*
scheme. This of course meant South
ern Pacific influence. Sherman's let
ter on the subject was written in this
city and is as follows:
Monday, a. m.
Mv Pear Friend: I wired you yes

of my coming up. There are some

BOOMING THE MOHAWK CANAL SCHEME
OP ARIZONA.
Sherman never tired of flattery or de
ception. In the letter that will follow
he deliberately misrepresents two of
the various schemes into which he had
inveigled the McDonalds and sugar
coated his deceit with fulsome flattery.
Monday, a. m.

SHERMAN COMES TO THE ASSISTANCE
OF 0. T. DYER.
A fellow feeling made Sherman kind
toward O. T. Dyer. Sherman was get
ting hundreds of thousands of dollars
out of the Pacific Bank and so was
Dyer. Dick had called Dyer all sorts
of names, but in the following letter
Sherman begged the young banker to
believe that he had made a grievous
mistake:
Monday, a. m.
My Dear Friend: I have, been think
ing of you all the morning. How are
you Saw Mr. D. and had a long talk
with him. Really I do believe we have
been mistaken in the man. "You know
I have disliked him, if possible more
than you, but in his talk yesterday
he seemed so grateful to you and
spoke so feelingly that I made up my
mind we had been mistaken. He 13

and it looks as if he would get out O.
K. Please not work too hard. You
looked half sick the day I was there.
Very truly, M. H. SHERMAN.
HOW THE WRECKERS GUARDED THEIR
SECRETS FROM THE PUBLIC.
On February 20, 1893, Sherman wrote
a letter in reference to a run on the
Riverside Bank that almost resulted in
the closing of the bank. If it had not
been for the timely assistance of Los
Angeles bankers the Riverside institu
tion would have gone down then and
dragged the Pacific with it. Sherman
wrote as follows to Frank V. McDon
ald" , .
S. F., Tuesday, p. m.
My Dear F. V.: We had a telegram
from Riverside last night that all was
quiet there and money coming in again
rapidly. You will notice that the
papers give Los Angeles. the credit of
saving the bank. This is good. We
' don't want it. or want our names men
'â â â  â¢ tloned, but I tell you that we did help
in Los Angeles and everywhere. It
would never have done to have had
that bank go down just at this time,
for the dispatches would have been
full of how much they owed P. 8.,
etc., etc, etc., sure. Truly. M. H.
SHERMAN'S WILD DREAM OF MILLIONS
Sherman's next letter describes a
scheme of the Los Angeles manipulator
to float four or five million dollars'
worth of bonds in London. R. H. Mc-
Donald Jr., D. S. Dorn and Sherman
were to discuss the matter and if they ;
found it - feasible the issue was to be
made The electric railway to cancel
its 6 per cent bonds. The project as a
matter of course was chimerical. Ex
cerpts from the letter are as follows:
L. A., Tuesday evening.

THE LOS ANGELES MANIPULATOR BEGS
HIS MASTER FOR MERCY.
A few days after the foregoing letter
was written Sherman was on his knees
in abject supplication for favor. His
master was angry with him and Sher
man begged and pleaded in sickening
sycophancy for a return to the good
graces of the young hanker. Excerpts
from the letter are as follows:
Wednesday evening.
My Dear Friend: Your two kind let
ters Just received. I thank you very
much for them. Some one here told
me that you all wanted to do mo up.
1 know that this is not true. I know
you love mo and that you fully realize
how hard I am trying. It has been very
hard work, but if we can get D. to do
this guaranteeing and if we can get
you a wad of coin it brings praise
to ynu and to all. Your not answer

SHERMAN TREMBLED AT "JAYHAWKER'S" DEMAND.
In the later history of the Pacific Bank even Moses H. Sherman could no
longer impose on the McDonalds in reference to the negotiable value of the LO3
Angeles Electric Railway bonds. These bond 3 at that time and even under the
valuation given to them by Sherman could not command fifty cents on the
dollar. Colonel J. H. Woodard understood that fact and was making new de
mands for money on Sherman. Woodard had already received $1000 and SherÂ»
man shows In tne above letter that his nemesis wanted fHOO more.
blame you one bit for feeling just as
you do. Pardon this poor letter but I
have been busy all the time.
M. H.
SHERMAN DECLARED THAT THE CHRON-
ICLE AND EXAMINER HAD BEEN
"FIXED."
The letter that follows is one of the
most important that M. H. Sherman
contributed to the secret correspond
ence of the Pacific Bank. In this epis
tle Sherman declares that D. S. Dorn
! and R. H. McDonald Jr. had "fixed"
j the Chronicle and the Examiner and
that nothing in reference to the condi
tion of the Pacific Bank will be pub
lished. "VVoodard had been in San Fran
cisco showing around a list of the as
j sets of the Pacific Bank and declaring
. that the institution was insolvent.
I Sherman declared that several news
| paper reporters had seen the document,
but that Dorn and Dick McDonald had
silenced the Chronicle and the Exami
j ncr as already indicated. In his letter
Sherman also said that he had spent a
: great deal of money in keeping the
I City Council of Phoenix from offering
encouragement for a competing street
! railway line there. Another effort was
i made to induce the McDonalds to give
j an option on their Phoenix water bonds
I and incidentally Sherman declared that
I he would go drown himself if his love
for the McDonalds did not restrain him.
He felt so keen an interest in their af
fairs and believed that it would be cruel
on his part to kill himself just when
they needed him. Excerpts from this
interesting letter are as follows:
Wednesday.
My Dear Friend: I think I had writ
ten you something about a Mr. Fay
bans. Among other things lam talk
ing to him about are the Phoenix Wa
ter Works. We are threatened with
strong opposition there from a rival
company and we ought at once ev
pend a large sum of money there to
prevent any new crowd coming in
there, and if this money was spent
we could double our own. Your
bank owns at this time, counting the
$23,000 note of Hines and Millays and
the J23.UW note of' my own, *ISS.'JOU
worth of bonds and notes, and it has
occurred to me that if you could get
one-half of this amount in cash and
the other half in new 5 per cent bonds
covering the whole plant, and with
such responsible people a3 those I
have named above at the head of the
concern, they to live there and to
manage the works., that perhaps you
would be willing to get out of the
whole concern.
I am working here without any
salary and I am at it eighteen hours
in the day, generally getting in my
office a couple of hours before the
rest of the employes and sticking to
it until late in the evening. When I
look at the old ocean at Santa Monica
I often wish that I could go into its
deeps and never come back and get
the rest which I much need. But
this will be a very cowardly deed and
it would leave you in a very unfor
tunate condition in regard to many
propositions in which we are interested
in together. And as long as you will
all love me and trust me and help me
you may be sure that I will stay here
and work, never asking for a vacation
or for a salary or anything else until
things are cleaned up. lam threat
ened with opposition in Phoenix to my
street railway lino and I have spent
a good deal of money in different ways
to keep the City Council there trom
offering such encouragement as would
give me immediate opposition.
You must acknowledge, F. V., that
there is nothing braver or truer than
for a man to stand right by every day
and try, through many discourage
ments, to clean everything up in the
right spirit, never shirking or run
ning, but trying to fix up everything
satisfactory to all. That nasty fel
low Woodard is Ftill trying to do us
all dirty work. He was in San Fran
cisco for a week and is now back here
again. He went to Mr. Spence and
told him that your banks were rot
ten and advised Mr. Spence not to
put any money in them. I understood
he has been to nearly every bank in
town and advised the same thing. I
suppose the reason he singled out Mr.
Spence was that he hoped Spence
would tell Mr. Maybury and he would
make it unpleasant for R. H. Jr.
He has a piece of paper on which
he has a list of all the assets of the
Pacific Bank and he goes around and
shows this to prove that the bank is
not solvent and cannot pay off its de
positors, and he took this list with
him to S. F. and showed it around
there and has done all he could to get
newspaper reporters investigating
.this subject.
This I learned on good authority. I
know that R. H. Jr. and D. S. have
got the Chronicle and the Examiner
all O. X., and that we will have no
trouble with them and will succeed in
accomplishing much, still, all these
things are very disagreeable and very
humiliating and they make me feel
more anxious every day to try and
help turn everything that I am in any
way interested* in into cash to put the
same in your bank.
Please do not worry, because worry
and anxiety is what kills people more
than hard work. Let's have only
kind words ami kind thoughts for each
other and thoughts of sympathy,
for the Lord knows we are all having
a hard enough time. Very truly,
M. H. SHERMAN.
SHERMAN BECAME PHILOSOPHIC AND
LOOKED TOWARD THE END.
In the next letter Sherman refers to
the fact that D. S. Dorn was suspected,
but the suspicion was unfounded. Sher
man wrote as follows:
Thursday.
My Dear Friend: I thank you much
for your kind telegram about D. S.
We are so glad that D. S. Is all O. K.
I cannot Imagine who started such a
story. Boat told me of it and told
me Cthis was just as I was going
home last night) it was common talk
on the street. I thank you all (<<r
the kind words of praise you all give
me. I will try my best to he worthy
of them. I fully realize the import
ance of the situation here. No man
could try harder. If a man does his
duty, people find it out In the end, eh?
We are judged hy the success we
make, eh? That is the way they will
judge you as the head of the Pacific
Bank and the way they will judge us,
eh? Corporations are a success or a
failure as people have faith in the
ability and integrity of the manage
ment, eh? And I hope you will not
hlamc me because my letters are so
poor. I try to write you every day,
but I am always in a hurry. There
are so many things to keep one on the
jump all the time. Sincerely, M. H.
WOODARD WAS AFTER FOURTEEN HUN-
DRED DOLLARS MORE.
In the followinf letter Sherman ex
ploits another of his troubles. Wood
ard was after him and threatened to
ruin him if he did not Rive up $1400.
Sherman seemed to be in great dis
tress of mind, but not distressed
enough to throw out a strong hint that
he intended to make another demand
upon the McDonalds for another large
sum of money. Excerpts from this let
ter are as follows:
Thursday, A. M.
My Dear Friend: Referring to that
p^irty. if I must meet him, the first
thing he will want is $1400. You know
he told me he would ruin me and etc.,
etc., if I did not come down and etc.
Your father told me not to give him
another dollar. Still in all of this I
want to do just as you think best. If
he comes in, if yrru think best so to do,
please talk pleasantly to him and 'say
Sherman praises him and etc-. You
know I do praise his ability. He has
much, if It was only of a good kind.
In the other matters T want to do just
what we say. You have some 600 of
Los Angeles street railway bonds. If
we could get $300,000 in cash for you,
one-half cash and also get such an
amount of money for the company to
enable us to do such things as will
enable us to cut down expenses, one
third or I hope more. If we could do
the above and not call on you for a dol
lar it would make me very happy. It
is not sure that we can do the above,
but we can try and I .think we are on
a good lead, i. c., strong people. Then
regarding the Phoenix matter. AYe
must spend some money there. A goo^
deal or it to improve and extend our
plant there and keep out opposition.
I don't want to call on you for an as
sessment on stock, and so I have some
plans that I want to talk over with
you. On run. M. H. S.
THE WRECKERS BOASTED THAT THEY
WERE SOLID WITH ATTORNEY GEN
ERAL HART.
One of the most important letters, il
lustrating Sherman's dishonesty and
ex-Attorney General Hart's collusion
with the bank robbers, was written ear
ly in 1893, while the Legislature was
in session. In this letter Sherman
writes to Dick that Hart is all O. K.
now and will remain in office for two
years more. There is a tone of jubi
lant gratification in the letter, and the
writer also tells Dick that he haa so
managed it that one of the most Influ
ential newspapers of Southern Califor
nia may be used by him when and how
he wishes. The letter is as follows:
Thursday, a. m.
My Dear Friend: I was thinking of
you this a. m., and thought I would
just say a word. There is one of the
strong newspapers of Southern Cali
fornia about to change hands. I am
so managing it that it Trill fall into
such hands as we can depend on in
case you want it. Every day I am
thinking and planning about many
things. It was a grand thing when we
pulled down that Chicago flffht and
eot those people in. They are strong
and keep sending money to pay debts
with and to help. Otherwise we would
have been in the soup long ago. Dr.
Jenningson came over from Riverside.
T never liked Jenningson, in fact I al
most hate him. still I must say he is
faithful and ever true to you. As for
myself I don't want to get mixed up
unless you wish me to more than
necessary in these matters. I saw a
letter from Sacramento to a friend or
mine here in which H. expressed him
self as very grateful to you for letting
Mr. J. go to Sacramento. â  He -said. X
was a splendid rustler, and etc., etc.
I was very glad. H is now O. K^ana
you are solid with him; He will be In

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Nov. 15.â
The practice this afternoon was the hard
est seen on the gridiron this season. The
men went into the game with their fight-
Ing blood up and the second eleven fought
with the college team for every inch of
territory. As a result of the fierce plung
ing and' line bucking two men were com
pelled to retireâ Burmister, who was out
for the first time in two weeks, and Cap
tain Fisher, who was laid out in a scrim
mage. Neither was seriously hurt. The
field now presents a busy appearance
every night with the old playersâCle
mans. Downing, Fickert and Harrelsonâ
assisting Mr. Cross in the coaching.
Coach Cross is shifting the men about,
sizing up each man's ability. Blanchard,
guard, was shifted to the second this
evening and Cairns and Eaton, the fresh
men guards, were tried on the college
eleven. Gilman and Blglow are fighting
hard for the center position. Biglow
played on the college team this after
noon. Anderson is being trained as cen-
ter.
Long runs by Plate and Daggett. the
college halves, and hard line bucking
were the order of the day. Murphy was
unlucky in his tries at field goals, the
line not holding firmly and the passes
from center being poor.
Seats for the game will be on sale
Thursday, aijd the team will leave for
training at Congress Springs on Friday.

Proposed New Sea and Rail Line to
Dawson.
W. L. Bernard, editor of the Alberta
Tribune, now stopping at the Brooklyn

tion concerning the proposed railroad be

City.
"Calgary," he said last evening, "is in
a fair way to become the capital of a
larger Alberta, which will Include the val
uable Peace River country, through
which the line of railroad connecting
Calgary and Edmonston with Dawson
City is expected to run. A belief pre

kinds of ranching and farming.

Calgary by the Canadian Pacific at an
expense of JIOO.OOO, with an estimated pay
roll of about $10,000 per month. These

early next year, and, in consequence,
the rentals of business property in Cal

"What most interests San Francisco
is the line of steamers between Van

and Dawson City Shiping Agency) which
has already received the approval of the
Vancouver City Council and Board of
Trade.
"In the extension of trade, too, it should
be of material benefitâ giving to the resi
dents of Alberta the products of Califor
nia and to California the cheap prices of
Alberta's wonderful dairy products. It is
my opinion, too, that such a line would
not necessarily interfere with the exist
ing traffic between Victoria and San
Franciscoâ it would create a distinct trade
of its own."

CATHOLICS GIVE VOICE
TO PRAYERS FOR RAIN
By order of Archbishop Rlordan masses were solemnized in all the
Catholic churches in the archdiocese Monday morning for the purpose of
invoking the blessing of rain. Although the season has long since com
menced when the dry weather should have been superseded by different
atmospheric conditions, there is absolutely not the slightest indication
that the needed change is likely to occur.
The farming interests of the Stale have already been threatened by the
drought and, as a consequence of this fact, and at the general request
of people, both interested and disinterested, all over the State, mass by
the authorization of the representative head of the Catholic church In
this archdiocese was celebrated and prayers offered up to God supplicat
ing the visitation of rain upon those who are now aÂ»most without hope
of saving their interests from ruin.
Praying for rain in this city is not. unusual. It will be remembered that
less than a year ago mass was solemnized in St. Mary's Cathedral, and,
in fact, in all the Catholic churches throughout the city and State, for
the same reason that they were celebrated last Monday morning. Special
prayer was inserted for the occasion and read in Latin from the altar
by the officiating priest. People crowded the edifice and joined in the.
general supplication to the "Ruler of the Elements" to visit upon the State
the blessing of rain as a salvation of the homes of farmers and the sal
tation of almost life itself, which the ruin of the crops and other agri
cultural interests throughout the State practically meant.
Whether as a result of pious supplication, or the consequence of the
natural workings of nature, rain came and continued to come for many
days after the celebration of mass throughout the State. The general
impression in the church, however, was that the welcome visitation came
as a result of prayer and not the spontaneous change of atmospheric pres
sure.
It was in consideration of this almost marvelous advent of rain in the
early part of the year, after months of almost continual drought, that
renewed prayers for the same blessing were offered up In the churches
Monday morning.

SPIDER KELLY
AND MULLER
FIGHT A DRAW
Go the Full Route,
Twenty Rounds.
REILLY DEFEATS PETE M'GEE
MAYNARD AND McFADDEN BOX
THEIR FIFTH NO CONTEST.
Western tJlub Opens the Winter Sea
son of Sport With an Average
Lot of Bouts t*Â»
the Ring.
Spider Kelly and Fred Muller went the
full route, twenty rounds, in their boxing
bout at Woodward's Garden last night.
At the conclusion Referee Phil Wand de
cided it a draw, much to the displeasure
of the followers of Kelly. Kelly scored
many more points than his adversary,
but Muller was always on the aggressive.
When they stood off and boxed Kelly
always showed to best advantage. His
long- reach kept Muller where he could
do no damage. His favorite blow was a
peculiar back hand cross or chop which
he Invariably followed with a right on
the body. This took much of the speed
out of Muller, who was not over strong
when he entered the ring, owing to the
difficulty he encountered making the re
quired weight.
Several times during the bout each man
had his opponent in difficulty, and the
end seemed imminent when the tired box
er would recover and hold his own until
the bell gave him a much needed respite.
Muller was invariably on tho aggressive,
but the majority of his well-meant blows
were stopped by the clever "Spider" be
fore they had worked any harm. Kelly
did not seem at ease until the ninth
round, when he commenced to jab Muller
and play for his heart. This had the
desired effect, as it stopped his gallop in
a marked degree for a time.
In the eleventh both men fought them
selves to a standstill. In the following
round Kelly had Muller dazed, catching
him twice with right crosses. Muller
stood the severest punishment and was
saved by the bell. Both men tried for a
knockout blow in the nineteenth round,
and the partisans of each man had many
opportunities to yell for their favorite.
The mm stood In the middle of the ring
and gave blow for blow, paying but little
heed to their guard.
The twentieth round was a hurricane,
each man in turn seeming on the verge
of going out. Kelly clinched repeatedly
to avoid punishment. Muller tried again
and again to land his right, but the agile
Kelly seemed never to be at the place
where the blow was directed. When the
gong sounded the end of the round and
of the fight both were hammering away
In workmanlike manner and paid no heed
to the signal. The referee and the sec
onds had finally to separate them and
drag them 10 their corners.
Referee Wand held up both hands to
signify a draw. The adherents of Kelly
seemed In the majority, as their hissoO
completely drowned out the applause of
th"sÂ«- who thought the decision a just
one. The Kelly men claimed that on a
tally of clean blows landed their repre
sentative won easily. On the other hand
the Muller men held that he did all the
leading and was the aggressor through
out. He mixed things frequently and
then showed to good advantage.
Kelly was splendidly handled by Young
Mitchell, Tim McGrath and Frank Mc-
Connell. Muller was looked after by Mc-
Devitt. Hines and Gus Muller. Muller
seemed too finely drawn, while the
"Spider" was at his natural weight.
There was a great deal of sameness
about the rounds, each man having his
favorite blows and using them through
out. There was plenty of action, but not
much damage done. Kelly wore Muller
down with his punches over the heart,
and which Muller seemed unable to get
away from, especially when they followed
the "chop" blow.
Kid Maynard and Kid McFadden fought
their fifth draw. They have met six
times, Maynard getting the decision on
one occasion. They went at it hammer
and tongs last nigjit and neither could
obtain a decisive lead. Maynard. who is
a hard hitter, had the best of it up to the
ninth round. McFadden then shook his
old gold locks of hair and by his aggres
siveness made it a stand-off with his
game bantam opponent. Maynard land
ed the most clean blows, but could not
stop his sturdy opponent. The lads are
gladiators in miniature and their bout
pleased the spectators. Each apparently
thought he had earned the decision, but
the announcement of a draw by Referee
Wand was loudly applauded.
The opening bout of iÂ«e evening proved
an appetizer for the hard fighting that
followed. Jimmy Rielly of local fame and
Pete McGee, an unknown quantity, were
pitted against each other for ten rounds.
Rielly was possessed of more science
than his opponent, but what McGee lack
ed in that direction he made up in grit,
a long reach and strength. In the first
four rounds Rielly had McGee profuseiy
bleeding from tue nose, but the latter
did not mind it in the least. He met
Rielly's vicious attacks with straight
lefts and hard rights until the tide of bat
tle turned in his favor. Despite the en
couragement given McGee by a clamorous
gallery and a howling pit. Rielly kept his
man busy ducking hooks and jabs. In
ducking McGee proved himself clever and
saved himself much punishment. In the
eighth and ninth rounds the gore that
flowed from McGee's proboscis covered
both men. makin^ them take on a sorry
appearance. Rielly started to end hos
tilities in the ninth, but was met with a
determined resistance. During the last
minute of the round he landed a heavy j
right on the jaw and quickly followed it
up with additional blows, making McGee
grogtry. In the cheering that ensued dur
ing the rally neither the referee, seconds
nor fighters' heard the mournful clang of
the gong, and the men fought on.
McGee was knocked down at this junc
ture, and Captain Gillen seeing his gory
appearance stopped hostilities. Referee
ALLEGED EXTORTIONISTS ON TRIAL
Breezy Tales of tie Efforts of Elsie Williams and Her Friends
to Secure Captain Nevill's Coin.
WITNESS REMINGTON. KLSIE WILLIAMS. MYKON AZHDERIAN.
JUDGE COOK, a jury and a
court room full of spectators
listened yesterday to the ef
forts of the prosecution to il
lustrate the alleged manner
from Captain William A. Nevills.
in which Elsie Williams, Grace
Loose and Myron Azhderian are
alleged to have extorted money
The State's interests were in the
hands of Thomas Riordan, Reel B.
Terry and Frank H. Short of
Fresno; and the defense was con
ducted by George W. Baker and L.
Clark of Fresno.
The defendants are accused of
having in a particular instance ex
tended the nether extremity of the
aged capitalist, to the tune of $2000,
by threats of exposure of his re
lations to the woman Williams.
This act is said to have been per
formed by the latter and her con
federates while Captain Nevills
was lying sick at the Palace Hotel
and unable to stand off his perse
cutors.
Elsie is petite, painted, and in
earlier days must have been rather
pretty, with doll features and pecu
liar gray eyes. Her figure is dain
ty and her appearance In silks and
sealskins yesterday accounts for
the tact that she fascinated the
wealthy captain greatly to his
sorrow. The other woman is com
monplace and Azhderian is a
swart, hatchet-faced, black-eyed,
shrewd looking young man.
The prosecution, after estab
lishing the fact that Captain Nev
ills had given the defendant Elsie a
check for $2000, supposedly for the
purpose of keepin~ her mouth
closed as to his intimacy with her,
called a number of witnesses resi
dent in Fresno and this city to
show by inference and otherwise
that the character and reputation
of Elsie Williams was not enviable.
The young woman appeared to en-
Joy this part of the proceedings
thoroughly, and when it was tes
tified that Azhderian had shared a
cottage with her over night; that
but one sleeping apartment had
been occupied, and that a man's
shoes were seen in her room,
while Azhderian was out in the
yard in his bare feet, she enjoyed
a hearty laugh and succeeded in
blushing through her paint.
William Remington, who testified
to these facts, related several con
versations he had had with Azh
dertan calculated to show that the
latter was working to "pull the
leg" of Nevills. The fact was
also brought out that Nevills had
strictly forbidden Azhderian, his
superintendent, to stay at night
on the ranch where Elsie Williams
and Grace Loose were quartered.
However, the young man paid no
attention to these orders and spent
his time with the women when the
"boss" was away.
On one occasion Nevills came

cellent work.

seen at the ringside. Managers Man in
Murphy and C. H. Long had all their ar

home unexpectedly, and the re
sult was that Azhderian fled to his
own bed in the gloom of night,
coatless and bareheaded,, rather
than face the wrath of the cap
tain. The relation rtf this painful
incident also filled Elsie with mer
riment, and caused her to long and
carefully stare at the tips of her
boots.
Remington, in the course of his
testimony, stated that he had sev
eral talks with Azhderian, which
convinced witness that the young
man and the women were planning
to despoil Nevills of many thou
sands of his good iron dollars, but
what his scheme was he did not
know. On one occasion, while he
was painting a cottage that Azh
derian had built for himself Wit
ness asked if Azhderian intended
to marry Elsie. The young man
laughed and replied in the nega
tive.
"He explained." said Remington,
"that the girls were 'dead fly'; that
there would be a crash at the
ranch before long, and he was pre
paring for it. It was his intention,"
continued witness, "to entice me
big fruit-growers to his cottage, get
them under the inlluence of the
women and champagne, and then
make valuable contracts for fruit.
If they kicked when they became
sobered threats of exposure would
silence them. It was Azhderian's
intention after working this part of
the game to employ the same
methods with the fruit-buyers in
order to sell his contracts for high
P "^ was further brought out in the
testimony of this witness that
A*h4erian had visited him and
promised to substantially reward
him if he did not appear against
Af.biVrian in a damage suit the
latter has instituted against
Nevills.
One of the witnesses stated that
he had seen Azhrierian sitting on
the lap of Elsie Williams.
"Well, if It were a c: ime to sit
In n girl's lap. Mr. Riordan." .said
Attorney Baker, "you would have

"I plead guilty for myself arid

o'clock.
Hawaiian curios generously loaned them
for exhibition. The result was that the
spacious rooms were filled with an aggre
gation of articles which were rich and
beautiful 'enough to make any profes
sional collector's heart burn with envy.
Pictures of all descriptionsâ paintings,
photographs and sketches, all illustrative
of Hawaiian life, personality or scenery
covered the walls, hung against a back
ground of blossom and verdure. Tapa
cloth and mats of finest weave, artistical
ly draped alcoves and corners; baskets,
musical instruments, specimens of royal
China and silver ware, carvings, bead
dresses, fans and hundreds of other arti
cles were grouped on tables and on tem
porary shelves: Hawaiian and American
flags "were intertwined over the windows
and doorways, and palms and ferns and
trailing vines made a mimic forest of the
whole interior.
The rooms were crowded both after
noon and evening, and a very satisfactory
sum was realized for the very worthy ob
ject of the entertainment. During the
afternoon Mrs. A. D. Sharon read a very
interesting original paper on "Hawaii,
Past and Present." Charles Mayer played
several beautiful Hawaiian melodies upon
the zither, including the always lovely
"Aloha Oe." Harry Monges sang a tenor
solo Miss Levison acting as accompanist:
Mrs. W. H. Mills sang the "Star Spangled

THE CITY AND THE CITIZEN.
\A ORE than ordinary interest attaches to the
/ \ current number of the Merchants' Association
* * Review by reason of the publication in full of
the address of President F. W. Dohrmann giving a
report of his observations of municipal government
during his recent tour throughout the Eastern States
and Europe. The address is an able one, and de
serves the careful study of every citizen who takes an
intelligent interest in San Francisco and has enough
civic patriotism to desire to improve its conditions.
That Mr. Dohrmann found in the great cities he
visited much that should be imitated or emulated in
San Francisco goes without saying. A municipality
so young as ours has always a great deal which it can
Itarn with profit from older communities. The main
interest of the address, however, does not lie in what
is said <^f our shortcomings as compared with older
cities, but in the plans suggested for remedying them.
It has long been known that we need better sewers,
better paved and cleaner streets, a public library
building commensurate to the needs of a city of this
size, and a more efficient administration of civic af
fairs generally. The question of vital interest is: How
shall we attain these things?' To that question Mr.
Dohrmann addresses himself with earnestness and
with hopefulness.
Two plans are suggested. The first proposes that
the Merchants' Association perfect a programme of
municipal work and then call a large and thoroughly
representative convention of the people to consider
k and revise it. To carry out this programme a non
partisan organization is to be effected and a ticket of
candidates put into the field pledged to undertake it
if elected. Under this plan political parties would be
set aside and a strictly municipal party would appeal
tc the people for support.
The second plan proposes that the programme ap
proved by the convention be submitted to all candi
dates of existing parties, and the votes of the support
ers of the programme given to those who would be
most likely to uphold it in office. If any party refuse
to approve the programme in its platform, then the
candidates of that party are to be opposed with might
and main.
That strong objections can be urged to either or
both of these plans Mr. Dohrmann is well aware, and
he frankly says so. He is sanguine, however, that if
one of them be adopted and firmly supported^>y a
considerable body of resolute, earnest men, a great
work can be accomplished for the improvement of the
city. Nor can there be any serious doubt that he is
right. San Francisco will have a better local govern
ment whenever the progressive and influential men
of the city co-operate to effect it.
â¢It is not advisable to start a non-partisan movement
to that end. for in the United States all such move
ments are futile. What has been accomplished in
Boston and Philadelphia affords evidences of what
can be achieved here by party government if only the
right sort of public sentiment be formed to support
good government.
The first thing to be done is to impress upon the
citizen the sense of his personal responsibility to the
community. Upon that point Mr. Dohrmann was
both clear and strong in his utterances. "Let us," he
said, "unite and pledge ourselves and our best efforts.
Let us do our duty to ourselves, our homes and our
posterity. Let us at this time lay the foundation
broad and deep, so that, future generations may ap
preciate our efforts and benefit by them. Let us see
tc it that our city will fulfill its manifest destiny, which
is, to be not only one of the greatest but one of the
best of all dwelling-places on earth."
It is difficult to understand the system of logic em
ployed by the so-called man who, because angry with
an individual, stabbed with a pitchfork a worthy and
inoffensiv^ horse, the property of this individual. By
the way, the County Jail is marked by a pleasing ab-
sence of both horses and pitchforks, and society owes
tp certain citizens that they be safeguarded against
temptation.
Soldiers who without warrant search private houses
may sooner or later run against a citizen who will
voice his objections through the convincing method
of using a shotgun on them. The fact that his house
is his castle will be regarded as sufficient warrant.
Even if the United States take the Philippines
from Spain there will be the insurgents still to deal
with. They will never give a quitclaim deed without
considerable preliminary haggling.
There is no occasion for the Filipinos to appeal to
America. This country has plenty of representatives
at the islands who will give respectful hearing to a
recital of native woes.
If the pound is to remain in politics it should be
used for the impounding of politicians.
THE SAN FBAN CISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 16, 1898.
THE FALSEHOOD ABOUT VflN FLEET.
JV yi R. JUSTICE VAN FLEET was defeated for
/ \ election to the Supreme bench by a rank
*â  * falsehood started by the Examiner and propa
gated in the fusion press.
This falsehood was to the effect that Justice Van
Fleet, in the Fox case, had decided that a poor man
was not entitled to as much damages for the killing of
his child by a railroad as a rich man. A large number
of Superior Court Judges all over the State, Demo
crats and Republicans, among them Judge Budd, the
father of Governor Budd, appeared in denial of the
Examiner falsehood and slander. They certified that
Justice Van Fleet had made no such decision, but that
the judgment of the Supreme Court in the Fox case,
in which the whole bench concurred, was simply a
correct statement of the law of compensatory dam
ages in such cases, and that the law is so well settled
that the same decision would be given in any Supreme
Court in the United States.
It is plain, then, that Justice Van Fleet was beaten
by a most arrant slander and outrageous falsehood.
It goes without saying that if the bench is to be con
trolled by such means, and men are to be beaten or
elected by the circulation of lies, our whole judicial
system is apt to be destroyed, and the administration
of justice to be put at the mercy of any wretch who
commands the publicity necessary to the hurtful cir
culation of a lie. The offense of the Examiner, while
making Justice Van Fleet its immediate victim, is in
its essence a crime against the personal and property
rights of every citizen, since it subjects the courts
which protect those rights to the control of liars and
slanderers.
The Examiner has. since the election, sought to
justify itself and to maintain its position by con
tinuing to repeat its falsehood.
In a recent issue it says: "Now. as a matter of fact,
the rule of loss of service as a measure of damages
is obsolete. It is never followed because it is impos
sible and absurd. * * * If there is any reason why
the grief of a father or mother over the death of a
child, caused by gross negligence, should not be con
sidered in damages, we fail to see it."
Now, on the contrary, the rule of loss of service is
the only rule followed in every American court, be
cause it is the only feasible rule. The Supreme Court
of California followed that rule in the Fox case be
cause it is the only rule by which a measure of dam
ages can be found. Instead of being a rule that works
against the poor man damaged by the death of his
child, it is his special protection, for the reason that
irs the homes of the poor children must earlier begin
service that brings bread to the table. This service
may be only in the daily duties of the household, at
first of the simplest nature, but duties which, if dis
charged by the parent, abridge his wage-earning
labors and entail loss upon him. In the homes of the
rich these services are not exacted of the child, nor
i- it required to be a wage-earner outside to con
tribute to the family support. Therefore it is plain
that the rule which the Examiner falsely says is ob
solete is a rule followed by all our courts for the ben
efit of the poor- man instead of to his detriment. Had
Justice Van Fleet treated it as obsolete he would
really have taken from the poor man a protection
whjch he enjoys in the courts.
The lying perversion of the Examiner has led to
the injury of Justice Van Fleet at the hands of the
very kind of people in whose favor he upheld a rule
of law which is for their benefit and protection.
An inspection of the dictum of the Examiner that
parental grief is the proper rule of damages demon
strates its folly. If the household service of a child
save to its parent one hour a day, it saves to him an
hour's wages. If his earnings are, say, 25 cents an
hour, there is a concrete basis on which to estimate
damages. The natural conclusion that the child, when
qualified by age to enter upon a wage-earning occu
pation, before reaching its majority, will have an
earning capacity equal to that of its father's vocation,
carries this concrete basis of damages through to the
end of the child's minority. On this basis damages
are estimable. They may be mathematically
measured.
But passing to the rule upon which the Examiner
insists, a rule unknown to the courts and foreign to
the law, there is no basis at all for the estimate and
measure of damages. Who can express in dollars
and cents a mental emotion? Who can measure the
varying degrees of grief and assess a money value to
them? What sum of money can pay for grief and
compensate the sufferer for sorrow?
The law is an exact science. It deals with concrete
things, with the material, and not the immaterial and
ineffable. Therefore it cannot measure grief, nor put
a value on ineffable emotions. The effect of grief, and
its prolongation, depend upon individual tempera
ment. In many instances sorrow for the dead leads
to suicide. What court 01 jury can make money com
pensation in damages for such a grief?
It is plain, therefore, that the only rule of damages
is the one established by the law, followed by all the
courts and stated in the decision written by Justice
Van Fleet and declared to be the law by Judge Budd
and jurists of the Superior Courts of all parties.
The Examiner beat Justice Van Fleet by lying.
Its act was no more honorable than if it had sent a
man to his house with a forged message to his wife
for his watch and purse for the purpose of stealing
his property. Its defense of its lying since the elec
tion is as dishonorable as the original offense. Every
Judge, Justice, lawyer and thinking man in the State
knows that it used falsehood to affect an election to
the Supreme bench, and that by so doing it struck an
envenomed blow at the courts, thereby weakening
and seeking to destroy the judicial safeguards set
around person and property in this State.
To his imperishable honor be it said that Senator
White denounced from the fusion stump this Exam
iner lie about Justice Van Fleet. So should all good
men denounce and resent it, and punish the paper's
attempt to justify it since its deception of the people
worked Justice Van Fleet's rejection at the polls.
THE REVOLT AGAINST BfIILEY.
WHEN Bailey of Texas was elevated to the posi
tion of leader of the Democratic party in the
House at the beginning of the present Con
gress there was joy in the party, for it was believed
the leadership would have in it something of the
vigor, the energy and the animation of youth. Dem
ocracy had grown weary of her futile old war-horses
and received the young man with the ardor of great
hopes.
It is known to all the nation how disappointing to
the House, to his party and to the country the new
leader has been. The contests between the two par
ties during the last session were not many nor were
they of great moment, but they were sufficient to
show that Bailey has neither tact nor force in dealing
with men; neither statesmanship nor political
sagacity in dealing with great issues. He did not
distinguish himself in any way except by refusing to
attend a dinner where he would be expected to wear a
dress coat.'
As a natural result of these deficiencies there is *
widespread revolt against him in all sections of his
party. Not only are nearly all the Democratic Con
gressmen from the Northern States to oppose him
in the next Congress, but many of his Southern col
leagues will unite with them.
The argument of the revolters is one of half con
temptuous opposition. For example, the Courier-
Journal, speaking for Kentucky Democrats, recently
said the party would have been much better off if the
Democrats of the House at the last session of Con
gress "had stuck a stick of candy in Babe Bailey's
mouth and thus kept him occupied."
When that view is taken of his authority it is clear
Mr. Bailey's career as a Democratic leader is about
over. There is no telling who will be his successor,
but the young man from Texas will take a back seat
in the next Congress.
THE DEfID NON-PARTISANS.
THE criticism of a correspondent that in sum
marily disposing of the late unlamented Non-
Partisan party we have been unnecessarily se
vere calls for a brief explanation. Our correspondent
will note that The Call has never charged the Non-
Partisans with corruption. On the contrary, we have
always given them the credit of a pure intention and
exalted motive, reserving for a few of their leaders
only the suspicion of knavery and cunning. It is not
exactly complimenting their intelligence to say so,
but we have always considered the Non-Partisans a
band of well-meaning old fellows, the chief end of
whose political existence was to have their legs pulled.
This leg-stretching never became painfully con
spicuous, however, until Mayor Phelan and his
brother-in-law took charge of Deacon Fitch's or
ganization. These gentlemen succeeded in completely
exposing the game which has been so cunningly
played by the other manipulators of Non-Partisan
politics, and the fact that Mr. Fitch's indorsement be
came worthless in the late contest was largely due to
the rawness of their methods.
While we may not entertain a great deal of respect
for the penetration of the estimable old gentlemen
who comprise the bulk of the Non-Partisan "conven
tion," we do not hesitate to disclaim any suspicion of
their motives or integrity. Perhaps they are not to be
censured for falling victims to the wiles of the job
chasing Democratic politicians; better men than they
have succumbed to conspiracies designed to deprive
representative citizens of their political freedom. But
we do blame Mr. Fitch for being taken in. He is an ex
perienced boss and manipulator, a thorough politician
and an excellent judge of human nature. There is
no excuse for him. The fat and unctuous Non-Par
tisans might have been fooled, but the lean and
hungry Fitch, like Cassius, was not foolable.
However, non-partisanism in San Francisco, hav
ing been thoroughly exposed, is now a closed inci
dent. In writing its epitaph we have endeavored to
be as kind as the truth permits, and our correspondent
entirely misapprehends the purport of our previous
remarks if he thinks we have intended to reflect at all
upon the character of the old fossils who mainly com
posed Deacon Fitch's late "convention."
The Non-Partisans meant well, but their theory of
politics was wrong and they were "worked" by job
chasing Democratic politicians. There is no such
thing as non-partisanism in politics. It is a delusion
and a snare. It is always a resource of the bosses for
purloining votes. Politics is the science of- getting
the offices, and that is partisan to the last degree.
Only dead politicians are non-partisans. All others
are violently partisan.
BURGLARY AND THE HONEYMOON.
ANOTHER burglar has made the plea that he
stole so as to provide food for his wife, a
bride of six weeks. This plea is battered,
frayed, played out. If true in this particular case, it
only serves to aggravate the offense. Nobody has
any business to get married unless sure of flour and
potatoes enough to last at least through a reasonable
honeymoon. At the expiration of this period the
bride could better take in washing or kick the groom
out and go back to the old folks than permit herself
to be pampered on the fruits of nocturnal raids.
There are comparatively few able-bodied people
who are obliged to go hungry, although they may be
short on pie. Circumstances have arisen under which
larceny is regarded as a moderate offense. A hungry
man snatching a loaf of bread is never by the law
viewed so austerely as the well-fed thief. Indeed, pub
lic sympathy is apt to be with him. He stands in a
more favorable light even than the kleptomaniac who
to the crime of stealing adds that of lying, and spreads
the cloak of a bogus respectability over the pair.
The particular burglar under consideration would
have had a better chance with a jury if he had pre
tended to be a subject of kleptomania, lifting portable
property simply because he could not help doing so,
and greatly to his own regret. Then he could have shed
a few tears, his lawyer could have spoken eloquently
of the lonely bride sitting in tears, and the prisoner
have gone his way. pitied as the victim of a relentless
malady. But deliberate burglary on, a pretense of
famine is without the pale of solicitude. We fear the
honeymoon has not merely been impaired, but re
sumption of it indefinitely postponed.
FUNNY PORIS PAPERS.
THE press of Paris is an instance of habitual
hysterics. Here it is railing at the "hypocrisy"
of the United States, while the whole world is
ringing with the most shocking revelations concern
ing France ever made of a civilized nation. The
Dreyfus affair, however it may terminate, has given
to the history of the French people a black and in
delible page. There has been shown to exist in offi
cial circles a depth and foulness of corruption such as
even a Zola could not adequately portray. Compared
with a truthful description of it the seething impurity
of the pool of Lourdes, set forth in fullest detail,
would afford pleasant reading.
The present is an excellent time for the papers of
France to first see their own house put in order. Let
them devote their energies to the revivification of
an honor which seems dead, to the purging of the
high places, the exposure and punishment of crime.
Let them correct the practices which cause a state
prisoner to commit suicide rather than lay bare his
secrets. Let them rebuke the army for acting as men
drunken on absinthe, and call upon the Government
to release the people from a despotism which, in
claiming to be a republic, stamps itself as a sham.
There is plenty for the French press to do. It has
troubles within the borders of its own country. The
impertinent and childish meddling with affairs which
in no manner concern it will after a while become ir
ritating, and perhaps cause remark.

AN IDYL OF THE FERRY
Last night upon the upper deck there came a maiden there And while
the light was dim and low, so eyes could reach a foot or so. I think that she
was fair. She wore a sacque of sealskin long, the collar to her ears; the
â way her silken skirts frou-froued would drive a man to beers. Her nat,
it was a picture hat. in width about a yard, and though I could not see her
face, I hold it in regard. ....
She sat her down and braved the breeze, then blowing swift and chill,
it tore my whiskers, made me sneeze; I really thought that I would freeze,
and surely she'd get ill. But no, she took her picture hat and placed it in
her lap, defying winds to make her bangs encounter a mishap. (Please let
your accents fall just right or you will spoil this rhyme. I'd like to build
the thing anew, but really there's no time.) I asked her if she didn t fear
that she would catch a cold. It may be that she didn't hear, but still, low
down, I muchly fear, she thought me badly bold.
When soon Goat Island loomed up close she darted for the rail, I felt my
cheeks with terror quake the instant that she made the break, and eke
my knees grow pale. But quick I hastened in her wake prepared to make
a grab. She turned and daggers looked at me, for while too dark to clear
ly see, I felt the glances stab. The truth was that the frisky wind had
whisked her hat away, and I thought she meant suicide, and she thought I
got gay.
'Twas then I hurried down below and sought a wicked bar where
maids in sealskin never go, but consolations ebb and flow, and creature
comforts are. THE INNOCENT MASHER.

One of the
prominent mem
bers of the Ala
nieda delegation,
at the last Re
publican Conven
tion, held at Sac
ramento, was W.
Nil Friend of
lengthy persuasion. Of course, he and his
colleagues were extremely desirous of hav
ing Dr Pardee receive the gubernatorial
nomination, but their efforts in his be
half were futile and Gage plucked the
coveted plum. Naturally Friend felt
very disconsolate over the defeat of the
man on whom he had pinned his faith, but
when several other candidates for nomi
nations, which his delegation championed,
had gone the way of Pardee, Friend was,
to say the least, down in the mouth.
After the convention, had adjourned till
the next day, when the remaining offices
were to be filled. Friend was sitting in the
lobby of the Golden Eagle Hotel sadly
cogitating over his disappointments and
wondering if the morrow would bring
further defeats for his county. He was
considering the advisability of deserting
his delegation, over which a "Jonah"
seemed to hover, when he suddenly
espied Dan Burns. Going up to him with
a rueful countenance, and being aware of
the colonel's well-known predilection for
horses, he began to storm the citadel of
his good graces in the following terms:
"Dan, old fellow, I wish you would put
me next to a few good things. Here I
have been backing a lot of 'skates' and
they have proved themselves 'dead ones'
by coming 'absolutely nowhere." Now,
you are on the inside and I would like to
play a few winners in the convention to
morrow. I hate to be a loser on every
race. Come, now, let me have some tips
on to-morrow's 'events.' "
Burns listened to the entreaty with
out moving a muscle of his countenance
and with a sly wink, he said:
" Friend, I can't give you any tips now,
but I tell you what I will do. I'll go up
stairs and study the 'form book' and I
promise to give you some 'good things'
early to-morrow morning." And with that
the astute colonel vanished up the stairs.

STOLE BREAD AND MILK.
Sentence of Lawrence Stodolski, a
"Wealthy Old Miser, Postponed.
Lawrence Stodolski,' the wealthy old
miser who was arrested about ten days
ago for stealing milk and bread from his
tenants on Natoma street, was again ar
rested yesterday on a similar charge.
The complaining witness is Martin Bian
chi, a milkman, living at 716 Greenwich
street.
When the first case against Stodolski
was called in Judge Low's court yesterday
his attorney, F. C. Castlehun, asked for
a postponement of eentence for a week
as he wanted to show that the old man
had been acting queerly for some time
and was not responsible for his actions.
The Judge granted the request.

WILL SOON CONTEST
ADOLPH SUTRO'S WILL
MRS. KLUGE SUTRO READY TO
OPEN THE FIGHT.
Her Petition to Be Appointed Guar
dian of Her Children Granted
by Judge Troutt.
Mrs. Clara Kluge-Sutro was armed with
authority by Judge Troutt yesterday to
prosecute any action she may see fit on
behalf of her children against the estate
of the late Adolph Sutro. Mrs. Kluge-
Sutro was granted her application to be
apointed guardian of her children, Adolph
and Adolphine, whom she avers are the
children of the deceased philanthropist.
The petition, was granted without oppo
sition. Mrs. Kluge-Sutro took the stand
and simply testified that she was the
mother of Adolph and Adolphine Sutro,
as she called them. No testimony us
to their paternity was offered; this will
be brought out in the contest of the will
of the dead millionaire soon to be insti
tuted.
In the petition Mrs. Kluge-Sutro avers
that the children named have large prop
erty interests within the jurisdiction of
the court. The children, it is said,
through a conveyance made by Sutro,
when he was supporting them and their
mother in the home he built for their oc
cupation at Steiner and Clay streets, are
at present possessed of block No. 219, out
side lands, which is valued at about $20,
000.
The petitioner seeks to prove that she
married Adolph Sutro by contract after
the death of his first wife, Leah. Should
she fail in her efforts to establish this al
legation she hopes to establish beyond the
peradventure of a doubt that her chil
dren are those of Sutro, and thereby gain
for them a share of the rich estate.

Sick Boy From the
Farallones.
Two of the vessels that formed part
of "the regatta" that was held off the
Horn the Ist and 2d of September last
arrived in port yesterday after an excit
ing race.
The four-masted British ship Falls of
Clyde left London and the three-masted
British ship Merioneth left Swansea for
San Francisco within five days of each
ether. On July 4 they were in company,
and from that time until they met off the
Golden Gate they have been playing at
hide and seek. First one and then the
other ship would get the breeze, draw
ahead and disappear for a couple of
weeks or a month, only to find themselves
together again with the first lust and vk-e
versa.
The two vessels were nearly a month
out before they met, and parted after
exchanging signals. As the Merioneth
holds the record for the run between
sea and Shi; Francisco, and was then
days ahead Of the Falls of Clyde,
Captain Rowland naturally expected to
1 San Francisco first, and signaled
Captain Anderson that he would
him on arrival. Anderson signaled back,
"Thank you; I'll do the same for you,"
and the race began. On July 14 the ships

DR. GARDNER'S HANDS
UNTIED AT LAST
There was consternation in the ranks of the Society for the Im
portation of Chinese Women when the news was received from
Washington yesterday that the Secretary of the Treasury had pro
moted Chinese Interpreter Rev. Dr. John Endicott Gardner to the po
sition of Chinese Inspector. It came with the suddenness of a bomb
shell, and before the coolie brokers and their friends in the Federal
building could realize that the impossible had happened, Dr. Gardner
had called upon Customs Collector Jackson and had taken the oath
of office.
The donor was not promoted at the request of Chief Meredith
of the Chinese Bureau. The promotion came about In consequence
of a recommendation made by Special Agtnt Moore in a recent re
port, in which he laid before the Secretary of the Treasury the dif
ficulties under which Dr. Gardner had been laboring, both before and
since Mr. Meredith took charge of the bureau. It has been common
knowledge that the doctor had never been extended the facilities
which should have been afforded him for the suppression of the Chi
nese trade in female slaves. He was used as a phonograph, and his
hands were practically tied behind his back. The doctor will be en
abled to make investieations on his own account, as well as inter
pret, and he will bÂ« no longer hampered by th>- Chinese v ing which
seems to dominate the machinery of exclusion.

together and fought their way through the same kind of weather to the Farallones, where they found themselves
in company once more. Both took tugs, but the Falls of Clyde beat the Merioneth to an anchorage by a ship's
length. Counting from the time the vessels left England the Merioneth wins by five days, but counting from July
4, when they first met, the Falls of Clyde "won by a nose."

a landing after several narrow escapes,

FOUR ARRESTS MADE WITHIN
THE PAST TEN DAYS.
The Police Object to a Charge of
Burglary Being Arbitrarily
Reduced to Malicious
Mischief.
Complaints are being made almost daily
by storekeepers on Market street to the
police of their showcases being broken
About 1 o'clock yesterday morning a
showcase at the entrance to the Baldwin
clothing store was broken open and sev
eral pairs of gloves were stolen. The
thief broke off the lock, evidently being
afraid that breaking the glass might be
heard. He was observed by Policemen
C. Muphy and R. McDowell and they saw
him making for the Emporium. They
placed him under arrest and found the
gloves on him.
On November 10 a showcase In front of
Maginn's furnishing store, 840 Market
street, was smashed and a large number
of ladies' assorted neckties stolen. No
vember 11 a showcase at the entrance to
the store of the J. M. Brunswick Billiard
Supply Co. was broken and twenty ivory
billiard balls were taken.
In the early morning of November 6 a
showcase in front of Paul Lot's photo
graph gallery was broken open and a
gold watch case was stolen. Policemen
Meyers and McNamara saw three boys
running away from the gallery and they
pursued and captured them. A diamond
which had evidently been used to cut
the glass in the showcase was later found
on the sidewalk in front of the gallery,
and It was assumed that the thieves had
thrown it away when they saw the two
policemen.
The cases were assigned to Judge Low's
court, and at the preliminary examina
tion Monday the Judge, after hearing the
evidence, decided that the charge of bur
glary could not stand and ordered that a
chnrpe of malicious mischief should be
brought against the defendants. They
were booked on that charge; and when
the cases were called yesterday they were
continued until to-day.
The police are dissatisfied with the ac
tion of the Judge, and contend that the
defendants were guilty of burglary or
nothing.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. Nov. I."..â The premonitory
symptoms of reactions which were noted yes
terday in the stock market and even more
prominently in the bond market found their
Justification to-day. There were periods of
resistance to the decline and individual stocks !
in which the resistance was successful. But
the reaction gained in force as the day pro
pressed and the closing was decidedly heavy
In tone and at (tie low point, net decline being
the rule and reaching as much as a point in
a few stocks. The specialties were active all
day and the movements in them were exceed
ingly various and conflicting and influ<uiced by
individual causes. The market for railroad
showed a heavy tone from the opening,
especially in the internationals, which had the
burden of selling of foreign account to carry, i
The Grangers and Pacific* also encountered ob- j
Etacles to an advance.
The Atchta in Issues continued to be a strong
rallying point for the bull faction, the pre
1 erred stocks rising to 43V Further effort was
marie to sustain the railroad list bidding up
prices for the low priced, stocks, especially
Hi- isp in the southwest. The mystery surround
ing the pending disposition of the Chicago and
Alton also imparted strength to different rail
road stocks on rumors in connection with that
transact ion. Then: were unexplained advances
:n Southern Pacific and of 9 full points
in Chicago and Northwestern preferred. In the
specialties there were prevailing heaviness on
one hand in Sugar, Manhattan and People's
Gas. while on the other hand Metropolitan and
the paper stocks showed marked strength. The
Federal ks have been dealt In hereto
fore as deliverable when issued, a transaction
which did not call for cash. The certificates
are now being Issued and the resulting re
quirement for funds is assigned as the reason
for the weakness of these stocks. Manhattan's
weakness was attributable to a study of the
quarterly statement and the balance sheet.
Other iron and *teel stocks were heavy In sym
pathy. The hardening tendency of the money
market was reflected in the growing heaviness
of bonds, the market for which continued very
active. Total sales, 5C.310.000.
United States new 4s and the F,s declined Vi

THE LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, Nov. 15.â The Evening Post's
financial cablegram says:
The stock markets here were Irregular to-day
and ' less firm. Americans opened below the
parity, operators here being timid concerning
the outcome of the Peace Commission's discus
sion of the Philippine question. Later prices
rallied considerably, but the close was dull
again. Except for nervousness over the Philip
pines the feeling here is very confident in favor
of Americans, as it is felt that the currency
bogey, so much dreaded by English Investors,
has been thoroughly laid. ' ; ;V; V
For a time Grand Trunk was good to-day on
Montreal buying. Spanish 4s were bought
from Paris.
The German demand for gold Is strong at
77s 9%d. The tightness of money in Berlin con
tinues and a further rise in the German bank
rate is quite possible. There was a sharp fall

CHK'AGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Nor. 15.â 1t was evident at th"
opening in Wheat that traders playing for
higher prices were going to have a hard time.
Liverpool, instead of responding to yesterday's
advance, showed a decided inclination to go
the other way, and in this was jir-t alone,
Paris also showing weakness. Liverpool was
led higher to %d lower and Paris 10 centimes
lower. May opened %<B-\i,c lower at 6S',Â«i f rj66 I ric,
and December started lower at 66%QM%a
There were very few buyers of either option for
some time, while selling orders were large,
especially in December, and prices were stead
ily forced down, the first hour's trading re
sulting in May declining to 66 and December
to'66Vic. Besides the weakness of cables, bulls
had to contend with remarkably heavy North
west receipts, prospects of a continuance of
the same on account of favorable weather and
reports from New York that many of yester
day's heavy buyers had turned sellers. All
this was an incentive to short selling. Minne
apolis and Duluth reported 2088 cars to-day.
About 11 o'clock some improvement In prices
took place on the sale of 300,000 bushels cash
Wheat here and the reported sale at New York
of 125 boat loads for export. This caused liqui
dation to stop more or less and started cover
ing by the more timid shorts. December had
risen to 66% c by noon and May had recovered
to 66Â»4c. Bradstreet's statement of the world's
visible, however, threw a damper over the
market. This showed an Increase of 6,723.000
bushels. The figures were much larger than
had been anticipated and the market at once
became weak. Liquidation and short selling
became quite heavy again. During the last
hour's trading prices slowly but surely de
clined May closed at 6Cf/66Vic and December
at 66%e.
Corn developed considerable weakness. There
was heavy liquidation by longs induced by
lower cables fine weather West and the break
in Wheat. Short selling was general. May
closed V4<s%c lower.
Oats were relatively strong. Cash prices were
at a nremlum over futures and an excellent
demand was reported. This was a big help to
the speculative market, and though there was a
*mall decline early with Corn, this was soon
recovered. May closed unchanged.
Provisions were dull and heavy. The market
felt the big receipts of hogs and the weakness
in Corn. Late in the day the market improved
somewhat. January pork closed 2' 2 c lower,
lard 2 J 2 c lower and ribs 2^@sc lower.

LOW PRICES FOR GRAPES.
NEW YORK. Nov. 15. â The Journal of Com
merce says: Notwithstanding short supplies
speculative interest in Almeria grapes seems
to be almost wholly lacking, which is attrib-
uted to the unsuccessful results of ventures
in this direction since California became an im
portant factor in the supply of good keeping
grapes for holiday and winter trade. Prices,
while rather high on Almeria fruit this season,
are still below ccr Ures obtained In the New
York market at this time In several previous
years. Liverpool is still a factor, so far as
shipments to this side are concerned, and It
will depend In great measure upon how much
she can ship to this market whether prices
will be maintained at their present level or not.
Hut for California competition it is said there
would be no doubt on that score.

A local circular says of Wool: . "Locally there
Is but little to report; but what little there Is
Is more hopeful of a brisk business later along.
One sale of a hundred and * fifty thousand
pounds has been made here, . chiefly bright,
well-grown toothill woo!, at very low cost.
No other local trade. In the East large sales
have recently be*n made at lower prices. The
market there. as well as here Is glutted with
wool. Manufacturers are aware of this, and
therefore take their own time and make their
own terms as to prices, but a good winter trade
in ' manufactured goods will change conditions
to that extent that business after January
ehould be better all around."

TOO MUCH OF
MOTHER-IN-LAW
MADE TROUBLE
Prof. Depue Is Denied
a Divorce.
WIFE CLUNG TO HER MOTHER
HUSBAND'S EVIDENCE DID NOT
PBOVE DESEBTION.
May E. White Sues Her Husband, Ex-
Rev. Mr. White, for a Divorce,
and Says That He Left
Her.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Nov. 15.
Judge Ogden to-day denied a decree of
divorce in the suit of Professor James F.
Depue against Grace M. Depue, which
â was brought on the ground of desertion.
The main facts of the troubles have
heretofore been published, but to-day the
plaintiff went on the stand and gave ex
pression to additional grievances. His
Ptory was to the effect that there had
been too much mother-in-law, who, wit
ness said, "positively refused to keep out
of my affairs."
"My wife knows that I had money in
the bank," continued the husband, "when
we were married, and that it was our
intention to build a cozy home. But no
sooner had we moved than the mother
came upon the scene in the drama and
attempted to commit suicide because nor
daughter was going to leave her. I have
first and last fought that woman's per
sistent meddling In our affairs, and she
has been the cause of all our trouble."
Speaking of .the sniriting away of his
thirteen-year-old son. witness said the
wife had done this. She had placed the
boy with a Chinaman on a farm In -the
country', the mother forbidding him to
write to her, lest the father learn of his
whereabouts. All this, witness thought,
had been done to bring him Qplaintiffj to
terms.
Judge Ogden, in summing up the ease,
held that a husband's testimony Is not
sufficient to prove desertion; and though
the wife should have fors.uun her par
ents, it had not been proved that she did
not do 80.
A divorce suit was also commenced to
day by May E. White for ;i separation
Fred M. White on the ground
;i. Defendant is a retired minister
of the gospel, and the parties have two
children.
Judge Ogden to-day granted Martha E.
Hand a divorce from B. Frank Hand on
the gTound of extreme cruelty. Plaintiff
iwarded tW monthly alimony, $100
counsel fees and is permitted to resume
her maiden name â Martha K. Taylor.
Default has been entered in the divorce
suit of Rebecca B. Bonln against lsrat-1
â¢ ; ti for failure of defendant to an
swer or demur.

A GALLOPING ANGEL 1 11
"Gee- whiz! Do you mean to tell me that that namby-pamby flat, In-
sipid drivel is Postum Food Coffee? Take it away, and let me burn into
your mind as with a red-hot poker, this factâ Postum is a delicious
beverage.
"Let me repeat it. Postum Is a crisp, delicious drink.
"Do you understand my language? Postum is good, toothsomÂ© and sat-
isfying.
"But when you serve it half boiled It tastes "Wow! take it away.
"How to make it? Perfectly simple plan. Boil it! Boil It!! 801 l it! I!
"The flavor cannot be brought out of the grains until it has actively
boiled full fifteen minutes. Â»-.
"Excuse me, my dear, you did not boil that Postum fifteen minutes.
You may have had the pot on the stove that long, but that won't do. When
actual bubbling and boiling begins take account of your time, and then
allow full fifteen minutes for genuine boiling.
"Use four heaping teaepdons of Postum to the pint of water, and when
it has properly boiled you have something to be proud of.
"^heri a man wants Postum, he wants it. to taste good.
"There is one sure and unfailing test of the truthfulness of the cook.
If the Postum is , good she has properly boiled it, if it is flat she has not,
and no excuse will change that fact.
"One cur of Postum Food Coffee made right makes one a friend forever.
"If you have been poorly served, try again our way. You will not be dis-
appointed." ... -
If your -feelings don't give way to medicines, try leaving off "offee a
while. You may be one of that great army of active, bright, highly organ-
ized Americans that coffee acts upon as a slow, sure and persistent poison,
that first affects stomach and heart, then liver, bowels, nerves, weak eyes,
etc., etc., finally drifting into paralysis, cancer of stomach, heart disease,
'or some kindred evil. '
Some people seem to drink coffee and whisky without ill effects, but
when a man or woman finds that incipient disease persists in hanging about
them it seems, the part of wisdom to look to the cause. : Thousands of
brainy Americans have found that cause right in their beloved and unsus-
pected coffee cup.
A trial of ten days to a month without coffee but with Postum Food
Coffee (properly made) in its place will tell the tale, and if you find your
troubles gone, your eye bright and step elastic, with a feeling of energy suf-
ficient to do your daily work and enjoy life, you may be sure you have
spotted the worm that has been "hidden under the. bark."
Come along, now, and take an Inventory of yourself. See If we can't
quit being sick cranks, and put our machinery in shape bo we can do some-
thing in this busy world. ,â' .-.â â¢ . -' â¢ â ;.-. ;/ .'â  . ... *

NOTHING TO
BE SECURED
BY RECOUNTS
Church Gains in the
Official Count.
HONEST ELECTION CLERKS
DID THEIR WORK FAITHFULLY
AND WELL.
In One-Half the Returns Jordan
Loses Nine Votes and Stod
dard Fourâ The Sixth
Ward Reversed.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Nov. 15.
As the official count of the returns of
the recent election progresses it is evi
dent that there are no changes to be
made in the figures returned by the news
paper bureau. The tally sheet and fig
uring of over half the county already
canvassed prove that the election officers
did their work very intelligently and that
the Supervisors appointed efficient boards
of election.
The closest votes were those of Frank
Jordan and T. C. Stoddard for County
Clerk. When 10,000 votes (about half) had
been counted, embracing the whole of the
city of Oakland, Jordan had lost nine and
Stoddard four from the returns credited
to them by the bureau. As Jordan has
a majority of over 450 the official count
will 'fiot improve his position in the small
est degree.
Supervisor Church, It now appears, car
ried the Sixth Ward. The unofficial count
from this ward credited Church with 8M
votes to Glassock's 60Â«5. The official count
adds five votes to Mr. Church's figures,
thus giving him the ward by three votes.
The vote on the other candidates does
not vary at all. There has been some
talk of a probable contest in the Glas
cock-Church district, but the work of
the election officers is proved to be such
that there is little to be hoped for from
a recount, as Church's majority now
stands at 116.
The preparations for a great ratifica
tion next Saturday night embrace a
programme that will do Justice to the po
sition AJameda County occupies in the
Republican party. Marching clubs from
several cities will take part in the dem
onstration the city will be illuminated on
its principal streets, and after the par
ade there will be a royal time at the Mac
(l,iii..ugh Theater. The State banner will
be displayed on the stage and before It
this county will renew her allegiance to
the party which has recently scored such
successes. ._*.*Â»
It has been announced that Cxovemor
olect Gage does not think he can be pres
ent but Hon. Jacob Neff and many other
successful candidates on the State and
county tickets will be here and join in
the â¢Jollification.
Mi-, ady a candidate has come forward
tncing his desire for city honors at
the next municipal election. This pioneer
of what will no doubt prove to be an
army of office-seekers is D. W. Alden of
the Third Ward, who would like to be a i
Councilman.

Dr. Chapman presented a glowing re
port of the work of tTTfe league during the
past year. The doctor haa always Deen
known as a good man for taking up col
lections, ;md his begging propensities have
been frequently referred to. His report
showed that he fully maintained his repu
tation, for during the year he has held
seventy-six meetings, collecting the sum
of $9243 87, an average of $121 77 at each
meeting. Dr. Chapman believed that the
day is not far off when the league will be
strong enough to demand the closing of
all saloons. His report favored submit
ting the question as a whole to the vot-
ers.
Rev. T. C. McChe*ney. president of the
Anti-Saloon League of Santa Clara., said
that the work would be a great deal more
effective if the branch leagues had acted
more Independently of the State league. He
believed that if each league made a more
thorough campaign in its district that
practical prohibition would soon become
a feasible proposition.
An executive committee was unani
mously elected as follows:

Secret Compact Between the Two
Financial Officers of the
Lodge.
ALAMEDA, Nov. 15.â Alameda Lodge
No. 5, A. O. U. W., has under investiga
tion the acts of two of its officers in con
nection with the $2000 certificate en tho
life of the late Dr. Thomas Slater. The
story published in this morning's Call
connecting the names of Philip Seiben and
O. S. Meysel with alleged peculiar tran
sactions with regard to the late doctor's
life insurance created a sensation in fra
ternal circles and was a particular sub
ject of comment among the members of
the A. O. U. W.
Investigation shows that Meysel had no
hand whatever in the deal. Seiben, in an
Interview this evening, frankly admitted
that he knew Slater was in arrears to the
lodge at the time of his death: that he
had conspired with the ex-financier, R. H.
Ohea, to keep the fact from the Grand
Lodge, and that he would not have "let
the cat out of the bag" if he had not
been accused of blackmail.
The doctor's assessment was due June
28. His lodge met the following evening.
R. H. Ohea was the receiver and it was
his duty to report delinquent members.
According to Mr. Seiben's statement he
did not do It.
"Ohea whispered to me," said Seiben,
"that Slater was in arrears. rWe both
sympathized with him and his wife, and
agreed among - ourselves to say nothing
about it. July 5 we received word from
Redding that he had died. We did not
know what to do about his life insurance,
for we knew he had not paid his assess
ments. We â ' felt eorry for the widow
and again agreed to say nothing. Our
lodge met July -6. Ohea went out of of
fice and Meysel ' took his place. Ohea
turned over to his successor money for
Slater's June and July dues. When ? our

HAS ASCENDED THE BENCH.
OAKLAND, Nov. 15.â A. A. Moore Jr.
was appointed Police Judge by the Mayor
this morning and at once assumed the du
Â£ his office. Mr. Moore has been a
Deputy District Attorney for some years
and has been Prosecuting Attorney of the
Police Court. Judge Moore's first act was
Slater's assessments were included and
everything was all right.
"The first time Mrs. Slater saw me af
ter the death of her husband she said
she would pay me the money as soon as
she received her insurance. I had a note
against her husband for J350, but told her
if she would give me an order on the
Grand Lodge for $250 I would deduct $100.
She agreed to this and the order whs
Bigned and sealed before a notary public.
"When it was found the money was in
two checks they charged me with black
mail. Then I turned to the grand officer
who was standing by and told him that
the doctor's assessments had not been
paid on time. That stopped the whole
business. I will admit that if she had
paid me I would not have said anything
about her husband's delinquency."
MARSTON CAMPBELL
UNDER A HOT FIRE
SCHMIDT'S NEW COMPANY IS A
PUZZLEB.
Supervisors Are to Examine the
Books of the Bridge-Builders
To-Morrow.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Nov. 15.
The intricacies of bridge building and
the composition of corporations were
delved into by the Supervisors and sev
eral attorneys to-day. A keen battle has
developed between the two contractors
who would build the new massive steel
drawbridge across the estuary for the
county. The Schmidt Construction Com
pany did not take its books into the
board-room to-day, and Attorneys If. C.
Chapman and W. R. Davis appeared for
Schmidt and Cotton Bros, respectively.
During the arguments Attorney Emil
Nuabaumer reinforced M. Davis in the
i pi-s-fxamination of Schmidt, and at the
close of the day the company was told to
bring its books into the board-room so
that the Supervisors can satisfy them
selves as to its standing.
The contract is one of great importance
to the county, as it involves the expendi
ture of probably not lf-s? than $100,000. The
bid of the Schmidt Construction Company
is the lowest, but the Supervisors do not
believe, apparently, that tne company has
the necessary plant or experience to erect
such a bridge.
Maraton Campbell, the engineer of the
company, stated on the witness-stand
that the bidders had purchased from the
firm of Peterson & Johnson a plant mor
oughly capable of building the bridge. He
exhibited a bill of salt- showing that. $0500
had been paid for the plant.
Engineer Le Conte of Berkeley was put
on the stand to testify as to the standing
of the company and as to his experience
with it in Berkeley. Mr. Le Conte was not '
permitted to give much information. ;i.s
Schmidt's attorney stated that the whole j
thir.g was simply a play t>> draw out tes
timony in favor of Cotton Brothers and!
to belittle the Schmidt Construction Com- I
pany. and that the testimony if permitted
would be circulated all over the coast by
the Cotton Brothers to the detriment of
Schmidt. To-morrow morning the books i
of the Schmidt company will be examined, i
but it Is quite evident that the board will !
either award the bid to Cotton Brothers
or decide to reject all bids and readver
tise.

ALMOST A FATAL ERROR.
A. Vici Enters the Wrong House and
Is Slashed With a Razor.
OAKLAND, Nov. 15.â Antonio Vici, a
tinker, came within a very narrow margin
of being murdered last night. Vici lives
on Fourth street, and as he was going
home he unintentionally entered the
house next door to his. In the hall he
was met by a burly negro who whipped
out a razor and slashed him. cutting an
ugly, though not serious, gash over the
left eye.
The injured man made good his escape
without further bloodshed or damage, and
his wound was soon dressed and sewed.
When Officers Sherry and Hvnes and
Soecial Officer Doolan arrived at the
house of the negro the latter had disap
peared At least he could not be found
and Vici admitted that he could not iden
tify him.

LOOKED BY THE MAJORITY.
Plan Was Unable to Get Inside the
Honey â Obsidian Enjoyed a
Gallop â Una Colorado
Won Driving.
The horses ran well up to form at
Irgleside yesterday, but the crowd seemed
loath to separate themselves from their
roin. for the play was exceedingly light.
Obsidian. I'r.a Colorado and San Venado.
all stanchly backed choices, won for the
talent. The victory of Rey del Tierra over
his field did not create much of a furor,
but Lost Girl, which defeated a fast
bunch of speed in the fourth event at odds
Of S to 1. was slightly overlooked.
The attendance was nearly up to the
average, but the layers of odds all com
plain of a lack of business. Unless some
of the Lantern importations are trotted
cut era long, the game will be in need
01" repairs.
Piggott started in the day well by pilot-
Ing Obsidian in winner of the opening
seven furlong jaunt, going into the start
er's hands a 7 to 10 favorite. The brown
colt led all the way and won galloping
from Casdale, a3oto 1 shot. Ocorona beat
the heavily played Oraibee for the show.
The Joe Hooker gelding, Una Colorado,
looked far and away the best of the col
lect.on in the six furlong sprint follow
ing, but was hard ridden at the finish to
beat Eeina de Los Angeles half a length.
Jack o' Lantern made his first start in
many moons, finishing a fair third. He
phould do later on.
For the mile and a furlong run a warm
favorite was furnished in Plan, sent to
the post a 4 to 5 proposition. When the
chestnut gelding could not shake off Rev
del Tierra he stopped badly, finally finish
ing fourth. Rey del Tierra had things his
own way, and "led the 40 to 1 chance Dr.
Bernays over the line with plenty in
reserve. Benamela found the game too
fast for him, but managed to capture
Bhow honors.
The crowd fell heavily over the result
of the six furlong spin, fourth on the
card. Piggott had already ridden three
winners and his mount Judge Stouffer
was plunged on, at one time being an
even money chance. The Judge headed
his company to the stretch, but there
found the pace too warm. Near the pad
dock it looked to lie between Toribio and
Little Alarm, when Bullman brought Lost
Girl up on the outside, beating the former
sprinter handily by a length. Zamar was
well supported, but was never dangerous.
The Baldwin colt San Venado at last
won a purse, but appears many pounds
below a real good one. He closed a 9 to
10 favorite, and when he led the outsider
Bonnie lone past the judges two lengths,
was being urged along by Rutter. Colo
nel Dan, the second choice, was pulled up
by Piggott at the start.
Track Notes.
Starter Caldwell fined Joe Piggott, who
rode Colonel Dan in the last event, $25
for pulling up and spoiling- the start.
Piggott claimed the horse bore in toward
the rail. He was reprimanded and warn
ed by the judges to ride his mounts out
In future, whether the start suited him or
not. Joe probably overlooked the fact
that the recall flag is not in vogue at
Ingleside.
Bullman was originally carded to ride
Rey del Tierra, but at the suggestion of
Presiding Judge Smith, Owner Murray
was prevailed upon to mount Piggott. It
apparently did not suit in some quarters,
but the change was undoubtedly a wise
one.
Joe Summerfield spent quite a profitable
afternoon at the races. He "doped" Lost

ENGINES OF
THE PETERS
WERE ALONE
Engineer Ran to Them
Just Before the Col
lision.
CZARINA BLEW FIRST BLAST
HER HEAD AND SIDE LIGHTS
WERE BURNING.
First Officer Kitts a Positive Witness.
The Biver Boat's Signals Were
Confusing.
The official investigation into the Pe
ters-Czarina disaster was resumed yester
day morning before Inspectors of Hulls
and Boilers Bolles and Bulger. The ex
amination of the first witness, J. H.
Deare. assistant engineer of the Peters,
brought out the interesting fact that
there was no one at the throttle at the
critical moment when her bells rang to
stop and back. Deare testified that he
was In charge and the engines were alone
at the time. He was standing in the
door of the engine room and immediately
went to them on the run. After the colli
sion he did not leave the engine room
until the water came up to his knees. He
thought if the Peters was going full
speed ahead she could be stopped and
start going astern in a minute and a half.
William Bell, a laborer on Angel Island,
heard two whistles and then another. He
saw a headlight but did not know which
vessel carried it.
John Crowley, nlgrht watchman of the
Peters, said that he was on the lookout
for passing vessels and saw the Czarina
; ahead before the whistles blew, but did
not report the circumstance, thinking 1 the
men in the pilot house, having- a better
| view, would see her also.
! A. W. Dennisson, steward of the Peters,
I testified in regard to the efforts made to
1 save the passengers, and that they were
! nearly all provided with life preservers.
Bernard Xyberg, a passenger or. the
Peters with some nautical knowledge,
i said he was standing on the right side of
the freignt deck and he first saw a red
light dead ahead. The Peters had not fln
i ished giving two signals when the Czar
ina gave one and he thought It peculiar.
Between the two whistles he saw the
green light, and after stepping to the
I starboard of the Peters he saw both
â  lights, but did not look for a headlight.
Chief Engineer Gustav Holtz of the
j Czarina eakl his vessel blew one whistle
and the Peters one, then the latter blew
two and the Czarina again answered with
one. His steamer was stopped, reversed
i but her headway was not checked.
At the afternoon session May Beckett,
a Salvation Army lassie, who was a pas
j senger on the Peters, said that she heard
â¢ only one set of signals, two from the Pe
ters and one from the approaching
steamer.
Edward Kitts, first officer of the Czar- I
ma, made a good witness and the most
rigid cross examination failed to shake
his positive testimony. He testified as to
the whistles, saying that the Czarina be
gan with one blast. The wheel was shift
ed to port and the Czarina swung to star
board, but how much he could not tell.
Cnptaln Seaman did not order it changed.
The one whistle was given as soon as he
saw the side lights of the Peters and so
reported to his captain. According to the i
standing rule on the Czarina, when an- ;
other vessel is approaching, he looked at
his own side lights and headlight and saw I
that they were burning and in their prop
er places.
In reply to a question by H. J. Corcoran
of the California Navigation Company,
he denied in the most emphatic terms :
that the headlight was not burning at the
time, but had oeen lowered, lighted and ;
hoisted again In place after the Peters j
was sighted.
Corcoran desired to prove that Kitts
was in charge of the Czarina and that he
did not have a license to navigato the ;
waters of the bay, but this contention
wns set at rest when the record was pro
duced, and Inspector Bolles said that :
Kitts' license entitled him to act as chief !
mate in any waters on any vessel.
Furthermore, in reply to a direct ques- .
tion Kitts faid that Captain Seaman was
In charge of the Czarina from the time
she left Vallejo.
Kitts heard no order given by Captain
Seaman to put the wheel to starboard
after it v.as put to port, but it was held
in the latter pofitlon until the order to
go full speed astern, which came about a i
minute before the collision. Before this
the port bow of the Czarina and the star
board bow of the Peters were each on the !
open sea.
G. F. Rave, first officer of the Peters,
was at supper wiien the collision occurred
and testified as to the taking off of the
passe-Tigers. Ho thought the reason why
the six Chinamen had been drowned was
that the flow of water which went art
carried them off thair feet.
Captain Holdswofth of the Peters was
recalled and t=nid he only paw the head
light nf the Czarina when the crash came
and that the Peters holds steady on her
course nnd readily answers her helm.
The investigation will be concluded to
day. Â»____
FIGHT FOR PURE
FOODS HAS BEGUN
DRAFT OF A BLLL CREATING A
SPECIAL COMMISSION.
War Will Bo Waged Against All
Who Make or Sell Adulterated
Goods â Much Power.
An important meeting was held yester
day In the rooms of the Manufacturers'
and Producers' Association by those in
terested in the pure foods movement.
Those present were members of the body
mentioned and of the Health Depart
ment, consisting of J. W. Kerr, A.
Sbarboro, Assistant District Attorney J.
J. Dunne, Dr. J. M. Williams, Secretary
E. Godchaux of the Board of Health, In
spector J. P. Dockery and Dr. Bazet.
Attorney Dunne has prepared the draft
of a bill to be presented to the next Leg
islature, the purpose of which 1r to cre
ate a State pure foods bureau or commis
sion. Mr. Dunne explained that the bill
was drawn in the rough from the Ohio
law. Its purpose is to concentrate the re
sponsibility in the matter of enforcing the
laws relating to this subject. After con
siderable discussion it was decided to
adopt the draft of the bill, which em
bodies the following features:
The proposed commission shall consist
of three members, to be appointed by the
Governor from the northern, central and
southern parts of the State. They shall
devote their entire time to the enforce
ment of the laws relating to foods,
drinks, drugs and unlawful labels. They
shall prosecute all violators of the laws,
and all local District Attorneys and
health officers shall be subordinate to the
commission in matters in which pure
foods, etc.. are concerned. The board
shall have power to enter or invade prem
ises where goods, drugs, etc., are sold and
take samples for inspection or chemical
analysis. All moneys from fines imposed
by courts shall be paid to the commission,
to be in turn delivered over to the State
Treasurer for the general fund of the
State.
In addition to making annual reports to
the Governor, the commission will sug
gest to the Legislature such laws as are
necessary to effect the desired end. The
act creating the commission abolishes all
other commissions whose duties would
conflict with those of the proposed com
mission. The commissioners shall hold
office four, three and two years, accord
ing to their appointment.
It was decided that four employes would
be necessary, a manager, chemist, attor
ney and inspector. The question of ap
propriation was discussed, the conclusion
being; that the commissioners and em
ployes should have $300 a month, and that
the Legislature should appropriate at
least $75,000 for the commission, all sur
plus going back into the general fund.
Inspector JDoc-kery in discussing the sit
uation said that such a commission would
do more good for the State than double
the amount asked for. One of the great
est benefits would be in the confidence of
the whole world in the goods sent from
this State when it becomes generally
known that California sends o^it of its
borders only products of an absolutely
pure quality.
Big Seizure of Fish.
The inmates of the Almshouse will to
day receive a genuine treat in the shape
of some of the finest fish that can be
found in the waters of the river or bay.
The gift comes from the Fish Commis
sioners and consists of 250 pounds of
striped bass. The fishermen around the
bay have for some time past been viola
ting the laws by netting striped bass of
less than three pounds in weight, fish
that when mature run from thirty to
fifty pounds, and which they sold in the
local market.
Deputies Vogelsang and Davis learned
that this lot of fish had been shipped
through Wells. Fargo * Co. from Giant
station in Contra Costa County and
the seizure was made yesterday
morning. The commission concluded
that it would be of no use to
attempt to make any arrests, as
there are a goodly number of tlsh dealers
now before the courts for violating the
law, and it is only folly to clog the court
calendars until convictions have been se
cured.
Death of W. J. Owen.
TV. J. Owen, the well-known capitalist,
passed away on Monday afternoon at his
residence, 1200 Jones street. His death
was very sudden. Early Sunday he com
plained of not feeling well and the indis
position turned into a stroke of paralysis
which brought on unconsciousness. In
this condition he remained until the early
evening of Monday, when he paid thÂ«
debt he owed to nature.
Mr. Owen came to this city in early
days and . engaged in several employ
ments, finally taking up with the butch
ering business. Later he became a part
ner in the firm of Grace & Owen. He re
tired from active life a few years ago,
and since has been living quietly with his
family, which consisted of his wife, son
and daughter. Deceased .was a native of
Missouri and was C 7 years of age. The
funeral, which is to be private, will take
place at 2 o'clock to-day.
A VERDICT WILL BE
RENDERED TO-DAY
JURY IN BECXER-CREEGANCASE
LOCKED UP ALL NIGHT.
Second Trial of the Skillful Forg-ers
Occupied Three Weeks and
Was a Spirited Fight.
Yesterday marked the close of the trial
of Becker and Creegan, and at half-past
five Judge Wallace had finished his
charge and the case went to the jury.
Judge Wallace left for his home at 6
o'clock, leaving 1 instructions to lock the
jury up for the night and announcing
that be would not give the case any fur
ther consideration until 10 o'clock this
morning.
The second trial of tho famous forgery
case occupied three weeks. The criminal
conspiracy by which the Nevada Bank
was defrauded out of $20,000 lias attracted
the attention of the entire banking world,
the reason being, not so much because of
the size of the swindle as because Becker,
who is known to the police the world over
by the sobriquet of "The Dutchman," baa
long enjoyed the reputation of being the
most dangerous furger of bank paper In
the world.
The first trial of the defendants result
ed in a conviction and both were sen
tenced to life imprisonment. There was
abundant rejoicing among the bankers
when the verdict of the jury was an
nouncec but it was short lived, as the Su
preme Court sent the case back for a
new trial because the verdict had been
secured by the uncorroborated testimony
of Frank Seavor and McClusker, accom
plices in the swindle.
His Zither Sounds No More.
Joseph GKchwardner, the well-known
zither player and teacher, died suddenly
of heart failure at Liepnitz's drugstore
on Sutter street yesterday. During his
life Gochwardner h;i* struck the strings
of his instrument in the presence of near
ly all of the crowned hea-ds of Europe,
and on one occasion played for President
Grant. In this city he will be remember
ed by all the prominent club men, having
spent many hours among them when
sweet music was required. The theater
managers sought him and he has enter
tained audiences from nearly every stage
in San Francisco.
He recently visited Portland. Oregon,
but finding that his health was rapidly
failing, returned t<> this city. Deceased
v.us 60 years of age and leaves a widow.
His remains are at the undertaking par
lors of Valenti Marini & Co., 1524 Stockton
street.

ATTEMPTED TO
ASSASSINATE
A SERGEANT
John Nixon Is Made
a Special Target.
MISSED HIM BUT SIX INCHES
JAMES WATSON SUSPECTED AND
ARBESTED.
His Gun Had Been Fired Recently
and Contained a Loaded Car
tridge â He Denies His
Guilt.
A disgruntled private of Battery I of
the Third T'nited States Artillery, sta
tioned at Fort Point, attempted to as
sassinate John Nixon, the first sergeant
of the battery, shortly before 10 o'clock
Monday night- The weapon used wa*
one of the Krag-Jorgensen rifles, with
â¢which the men of the battery are armed,
and the bullet passed -within six inches of
Sergeant Nixon, tho intended mark.
Nixon was fitting at his desk writing,
â when he was startled by the report of a
gun and the crash of a bullet striking
a chest of clothing beside him. He im
mediately ran from the tent, but in the
darkness could not see the marksman.
The call to arms was sounded twice %om
the guard tent as as the shot was
heard, and the entire battery fell Into
line. Sergeant Nixon reported the occur
ence to Lieutenant William Forse. who
la^ln temporary command of the battery,
and on his order all the arms were
stacked and placed under a heavy guard.
Captain Diens, the commander of the
battery, who is on detached duty rmis
tering out the Sixth California Regiment,
was notified of the shooting yesterday
morning and returned to his command.
He. with Lieutenant Forse and Sergeant
Nixon, made a careful examination of the
Ifuns and found two which bore the ap
pearance of having been fired recently.
One of these contained a loaded cartridge
and belongs to Private James Watson and
the other to Private Lewis. Both men
claimed that they had fired their guns
on Sunday. Lewis was able to prove his
assertion, but Watson was unable to bring
satisfactory evidence as to his statement,
and was locked up in the guard house
pending an investigation of the case.
The powder remaining in the barrel of
the gun belonging to Lewis, which is
known to have been discharged on Sun
day, had rusted the barrel slightly and
â was of a brownish color, but that in Wat
son's gun was still black, as if it had
been fired but a short time. This Is the
â¢only evidence which has been found
against Watson, and he protests his in
nocence.
Sergeant Nixon is at a loss to know
why Watson or any one else In the bat
tery should wish to kill him.
"I never had any trouble with Watson,"
said the sergeant, "and always considered
him one of the best friends I had among
the men in the battery. It is true that
I was obliged to place him under arrest
several times for being drunk and dis
orderly, hut he always took it in good
part, seeming to realize that I was only
obeying orders. In not a few cases the
men whom I have had occasion to arrest
have grumbled at me, but of all the times
Watson has been in the guard house he
never made a complaint of my actions
toward him. The position of "first ser
geant is not an enviable one by any
means, as the men often think that when
I place them under arrest it is of my own
volition instead of on account of orders
I have received; but I didn't think any
man under me had such a hatred of me
that he would wish to kill me."
Some of Nixon's friends say that he Is
very popular among the men, but others
In the regiment claim that he is univer
sally disliked. Among the soldiers of the
Sixth California, which is encamped near
Battery 1, the report is that Nixon is
very hard on the men under him, and
they attribute it to the fact that he has
been in the regular army so long and a
first sergeant for so many years that he
has come to think himself the "whole
thing." There is a rumor among the men
employed on the works at Port Point
and among the soldiers of the Sixth that
Nixon had had trouble with W r atson on
the evening of the shooting. This rumor
Is that Watson had a lady friend visit-
Ing him and Dixon hearing of it, ordered
her out of the camp.
The bullet intended for Nixon was fired
from a distance of about fifty yards. It
passed through the bedding of* the ser
geant's cot, struck the leg of an over
turned stool about six inches behind
Nixon, penetrated a chest and the cloth-
Ing in it, and lodged in a sack of woolen
underclothing. The sergeant attributes

A WEEK'S PEACE JUBILEE.
Entertainment at Grace Methodist
Church on Twenty-First Street.
The parlors of Grace Methodist Church
on Capp and Twenty-first streets will be
occupied during the present week by the
ladies of the congregation and their num
erous friends for the holding of a peace
jubilee. In order to make the entertain
ment as attractive as possible hot dinners
will be served each evening between the
hours of 5:30 and 7:30. for the moderate
price of 25 cents. After dinner the pro
gramme will be varied with social at
tractions. A great assortment of novel
articles, holiday presents, winter supplies
and many other useful as well as orna
mental selections will be offered for sale.
The entertainment last evening was for
the benefit of the Church Extension So
ciety, w-hich held its twelfth annual tea
reception and reunion.
The use of the church parlors was
cheerfully accorded by the jubilee com
mitee to the society for this occasion.
The popularity of both entertainments
had the effect of filling every nook and
corner of the edifice.
The object of this extension society is:
To seek out new places for missionary
work in this city; to establish Sunday
schools and preaching places; also to re
lieve overburdened churches, and to assist
missionaries who may be appointed by
the authority of the California Annual
Conference of the Methodist Episcopal
Church.
The trustees of the society are: Charles
Goodall, William Abbott, C. S. Holmes,
W P. Higginbotham, I. J. Truman C. 13.

MINERS MEET TO
ELECT OFFICERS
DELEGATES TO THE STATE CON
VENTION ALSO CHOSEN.
Julian Sonntag Elected President of
the ban Francisco County
Association.
Julian Sonntag was elected president of
the San Francisco County Miners' Asso
ciation at the annual meeting held at the
Chamber of Commerce yesterday after
noon. T. J. Parson was placed in nomin
ation for another term, Mr. Sonntag ex
pressing the sentiment that a change was
not desirable, as Mr. Parsons had admin
istered the affairs of the office in an ac-
ceptable manner.
On account of failing health and busi
ness exactions Mr. Parsons was con
strained to decline the honor of further
service as president. Thereupon Charles
G. Tale suggested Mr. Sonntag for the
presidency and the latter was elected by
acclamation. In accepting the duties of
the position the new president expressed
pleasure in seeing so many members at
the meeting. He predicted a great State
Convention of Miners at Native Sons'
Hall next week. Speaking of a recent
visit to Nevada City he said he was as
sured that Nevada County would send
eighty delegates. Information had been
received that Amador County would send
forty delegates; El Dorado, thirty; Butte,
eight; Santa Clara, 5, and that there
would be full representation by Placer
County.
In accordance with custom the chair
named a committee of five to recommend
vice-president, secretary-treasurer and
delegates to the State convention. The
committee, consisting of Lou!s Glass. W.
C. Ralston, Daniel Wilson, Nlles Searls
and J. F. Halloran withdrew for confer
ence and the convention took a recess.
The committee in due time reported,
recommending for vice president. J. F.
Halloran, and for secretary and treasurer,
Charles G. Yale. The convention elected
the officers so recommended.
The following delegates to the State
convention were recommended and
chosen:

LEE ON'S DIRT
BROUGHT RUIN
He Made Cigars Midst Unutterable Filth
and Inspectors Dockery and Davis
Closed His Shop.
Mr. Lee On, of 1114 Dupont street, a
maker of cigars of questionable ante
cedents and dubious quality, has, per
force, sur-pended, business and the Health
Department has padlocked his doors
against him until such time as he may
prevail upon his landlord to put his filthy
hovel in a fairly sanitary condition.
Lee On's factory has been under the eye
of the Health Department ever since the
crusade was begun against the reeking
dens in Chinatown. Cigar Inspector B.
R. Porter reported that the place should
be condemned six months ago, and from
time to time since the wily On has been
warned to shut up or clean up, with the
result that he has done neither the one
nor the other in good Celestial fashion.
On Monday Inspector Dockery gave him
notice to quit by next day â and he didn't.

JUGGLED WITH
THE LINCOLN
SCHOOL LEASE
Original Holders Were
Deceived.
STATEMENT OF JOHN GRANT
AMPLE EVIDENCE OF A JOB TO
SHUT THEM OUT.
Waller Ordered Secretary Welsh Not
to Receive the Rental From
the Former Lessees of
the Property.
Certain members of the Board of Edu
cation are whistling shrilly though some
what discordantly nowadays, said mu
siaal endeavors being for the sole pur
pose of keeping their courage above the
freezing point.
Somehow, they poom to have a premo
nition that they "are up against it."
John Grant, the well-known real estate
dealer and capitalist, ia the latest to shed
light upon the unsavory lease of the Lin
coln school property. Mr. Grant was the
original lessee of the lot at the corner of
Fifth and Market streets. He says he
firmly believes the charges made by John
P. Reynolds are absolutely correct. .
Last night, Mr. Grant related in detail
.his connection with the lease, 'and his
statement substantiates in every partic
ular that made by Edward McGrath, an
other of the original lessees and published
in yesterdays Call. Mr. Grant is a
methodical business man nd has- care
fully kept ail the - â  ers and documents
relating to the lease, even to a copy of
the old Evening Examiner of June 15,
1874, which contiiinr- the advertisement for
bids for the original lease. -
"Although bids we're advertised for in
I June, 1574," said Mr. Grant, "it was not
| until early in the following "ear that the
I lease was formally signed. This was
j owing to some hitch over bids for four
lof the lots. In Anril, 1875. I began the
erection of the building that still. stands
at the southeast corner of Fifth and Mar
ket streets,- which .cost me $38 000 to put
| up. I excavated for basement under the
j entire building out to the outer line of the
sidewalk, put in a hrick bulkhead "and
foundations so substantial that they are
ready to-day to bear the weight of a-mod
ern sky-scraper.. ; .' . . : : â¢ , . t- ;
"Under the terms of the'leaselpaid $4
i a front foot for the first five years/ $6 the
j second five, $8 the third and $12 for the
I fourth term of five years. You will see
that in the advertisement calling for bids
I it expressly states, that all improvements
belonged to the lessees, and it provides
that unless such improvements are re
moved within thirty days after the ex
piration of the lease they shall become the
property of the city; unless an extension
of time for such removal shall be granted.
! The lessees were given until September,
1875, before they commenced to pay rent,
the Intervening time being granted for the
construction of buildings arid putting \the
property in condition to produce revenue.
"From that time until 18S2 the lessees
paid no taxes, it being hfld tbnt th"* ofwv.
erty, being owned by the city, the im
provements on It ac well as me propftity
itself were exempt from taxation. In the
latter year, however, the city brought suit
against the lessees to compel the payment
of taxes as on the improvements. Judge
Hunt of the Superior Court rendered judg
ment favor of the city, whereupon tne
lessees appealed to the Supreme; Court.
1 That tribunal sustained the lower court,
I and in the opinion handed down it - dls-
I tinctly' stated that the improvements, be
ing owned". by the lessees, they were liable
j to taxation. â â .â â ; â¢â¢â¢â â¢â _â

taxes regularly, and I have all my re

Ben Davis when they turned up yester
day afternoon with a request for more
time. Dockery jingled a pocket full of
padlocks and said "to-day" and the
Chinese gave way to the officers and
newspaper men for a final investigation of
the premises.
On's factory consists of a low ceiled, vile
smellingroom not much bigger than nor so
inviting as a City Prison cell. In this
room half a dozen wrappers have been
wont to work, eat, sleep, cook opium and
scuff the tobacco that goes into their Du
pont-street Havanas under their bare
feet on the floor. A low, dark passage
leads to a kitchen that hasn't its equal
for filth in anything that Dockery ever
tackled. There was an opium cooking
layout on the greasy, smelling range and
In one corner sat a Chinese apprentice
dipping tobacco in an equally filthy sink.
The rafters and joints dripped with
grease and dirt and the whole place
reeked with smells that left nothing to
and supposed I owned. I will also say
that the lessees paid for all the repairs to
their buildings, and I do not believe t..e
city ever spent $1 for repairs on any or
the property until the original lessees sur
rendered their leases, notwithstanding trie
assertion is made now in support of the
present lease that the city was ooliged
to keep the buildings in repair. I put in
the elevator that is still in place in my
building, and the city did not even keep
the sidewalks in repair, that expense fall
ing on the lessees.
â¢'ln 1595. upon the expiration of our
original lease, we sought to enter into a
new lease, but the matter was held in
abeyance and we were told we could con
tinue in possession from month to month
under the old terms. Some of the lessees
gave notice that they would remove their
buildings at once, and the city began suit
to prevent such a step. Judge Seawell
decided that the buildings belonged to the
lessees and the city immediately appeal-
Ito the Supreme Court. That body,
getful of a decision it rendered in IS*2.
c-rsed itself and Judge Seawell and
re the buildings to the city. That was
October, 1897. Prior to that time we
i remained in undisturbed possession
the premises and members of the pres
ent Board of Education had repeatedly
assured us that if the decision was
against us we would be given every op
portunity to renew our leases.
"Director Waller was one of those I
saw personally. I had known hi*
father for many years and it was through
him that I met' Sam. The latter was
most cordial and promised me on several
occasions that it would be all right.
After the Supreme Court decision Mc-
Cormack, MeGrath and myself called
upon Director Burns, that being the In
terview described by Mr. MeGrath in The
Call, in which Burns induced us by
smooth words and soft promises to sur
render all claim to the buildings.
Mr. Grant produced the following copy
of the release, the original being signed
by the lessees:
To the Board of Kducatlon of the City and
County of San Francisco: The undersigned
hereby admits the ownership of your honorable
hoard of the Improvements now standins upon
the portion of the Bchool lot on the corner of
Market and Fifth streets in the City and
county oi San Francisco, occupied by the un
d- rMpned, or his tenant*.
Continuing.^ Mr. Grant said: "That
ended our possession of the premises. On
the second of the following month, No
vember, I sent my agent out to the City
Hall with the money to pay the ground
rent, but Secretary Welsh of the Board of
Education refused to accept it, saying
that he had been instructed by Waller not
to take it. I immediately called on jai
ler at his store. He received me cordial y
and sat down beside me. W hen I told
him of Welsh's action he jumped up. and
with the remark that I would have to
see A. J. Rich about it, turned and walked
away without another word.
"I was convinced then that it was all
cut and dried to shut us out of the prop
erty and my conviction wan strengthened
when 1 read the proposal for bids for the
new lease. It was so incoherent that one
could not make head or tail of it, while
the conditions imposed were so conflict
ing that nobody could live up to them.
The lessees held a conference, but it was
too late to take concerted action. How
ever, 1 had my bid prepared and a certi
fied check for $f>o<)o on the Bank of Cali
fornia ready. My lawyer had also pre
pared a protest against the wording or
the proposal, and asking that a new nro
posal be advertised for. Director Armer
was given this protest, and at the meet
ing of the board on December 8, 1897, when
final action was to be taken, he an
nounced that he had a protest and asked
that it be read. Waller jumped up and
moved that the board proceed to open
bids, the motion being carried. I saw
that the board did not intend to give us
any show whatever, so I did not send in
my bid at all.
"That is my knowledge of the awarding
of the new lease, and it is not surprising
that I place full credence in Mr. Rey
nolds' charges against the board."
Director Bantel denies that he was one
of the members who were banded together
to secure the lease for the San Francisco
Company, as alleged in Reynolds' com
plaint. Mr. Bantel asserts, and his as
sertion is borne out by the minutes of the
board, that he opposed the award of the
lease and fought it from first to last.

District Attorney Marti
nelli Criticized.
Nick Berg, the wounded boatkeeper,
who was shot by Ike Elk, now has a
fighting chance to recover, according to
Dr. Arthur H. Mays. Ever since he was
wounded Berg has been cheerful, and did
not think he would die. Yesterday after
noon he consented to talk to a reporter.
"I want to contradict some of the things
I am reported to have said," he declared.
"In the first place I have hitherto said
not a single word to any newspaperman
and Dr. Mays has refused to let any of.
them in to see me.
"I started for the Chispa from Captain
Roberts' yacht at Tiburon about 7 o'clock.
I met a fisherman near the Chispa and
I he told me that Klk and his wife were
both on board the yacht. When I went on
board I knocked on the cabin door and
c:illed 'Ike! Ike! Let me in.' The only
response I got was a grunt and then I
went to the hatchway and removed it.
This talk of my breaking the hatchway
is all nonsense. It wag loose and I sim
ply lifted it off. As the cover came off a
shot rant? out and 1 felt a pain in my
breast. Then there was another shot,
and pretty soon Klk and his wife came
out. He was fully dressed but she was in
her night clothing.
"I asked Elk what he shot me for and
ho made no answer. Then Mrs. Elk made
him take a boat and row me to shore. AYe
left him and walked up to tind Dr. Crump
ton. On the way she told me that Ike
recognized my voice and would not let
her open the door or even answer.
"As regards the Brooks murder I know
nothing of it, and, so far as my knowl
edge extends, I don't think Ike does. He
shot me out of pure jealousy and for no
other reason. I was on the yacht with
him and his wife last Thursday and he :
was in a good humor them.
'About two weeks ago he tried to kill
me out of Jealousy, and 1 stopped him.
Mrs. Elk teils me that the second shot >
Elk fired was at her and not at me. When
he reached town that night he remarked
to some acquaintances that he had in- :
tended to shoot me for a long time and
had finally succeeded."
"How do you account for the fact that j
three chambers of the revolver you were !
3hot with had been discharged previous
ly?" he was asked.
â 'Well. I don't remember how many !
were, discharged, but 1 had been in the 1
habit of taking shots at sralions now and '
then. Elk shot me with full intent. He
knew who I was. The Brooks murder had
nothing to do with it at all."
At this juncture Berg grew weak from
his exertion and his attendant would not i
permit him to say anything more.
The indifference of District Attorney
Martinelli of Marin County in this case
is the subject of severe criticism by the
citizens of that county. Martinelli de
clared yesterday that he had not taken
any statement from Berg or Elk and fur
thermore he did not intend to make any
attempt to elicit any information on this
case or the Brooks murder from either ol
them. He said he was satisfied neither
would talk, so he made no move. His
apathy is attributed to the fact that he
goes out of office on January 1.

WRIGHT WILL
BE SPEAKER OF
THE ASSEMBLY
His Candidacy Is Well
Received.
FAVORED BY ALL CLASSES
IS PROMISED A PRACTICALLY
UNANIMOUS VOTE.
Friends of L. H. Valentine of Los
Angeles Do Not Believe His
Name Will Be Pre
sented/
Aside from the Senatorial contest the
organization of the Legislature and the
selection of the man who will serve as
Speaker of the Assembly remains the
one topic of interest among politicians
and those actively interested in the
events of the next four or five months.
As to the Speakership, the tide seems
I to be setting strongly in the direction
I of Assemblyman Howard E. Wright of
I Berkeley, whose candidacy was an
! nounced almost two weeks ago. It is
| everywhere recognized and acknowl
\ edged that the coming session of the
! Legislature will be one of the most im
| portant ever held in this State, and
I for this reason, if no other, it is con
ceded that the presiding officer of the
Assembly should be a man who will
I command the confidence and respect
] not only of the members of the Assem-
I bly, but of the people of the entire
| State.
That Mr. Wright is such a man. it
is unnecessary to assert, as his record
as a legislator is above reproach and
his ability to perform in a satisfactory
manner the multitudinous duties of the
position is well known to all. Since
the announcement of his candidacy he
has been the recipient of many assur
ances of support from Assemblymen
elect in all sections of the State, as well
as from prominent men of affairs in
and out of politics. These assurances
are of such a nature and are so numer
ous that there is little doubt that Mr.
Wright will receive practically the
unanimous vote of the Assembly.
The only other candidate for the
Speakership who can, at this time, be
looked upon as strong enough to con
sider his own claims with seriousness
is L. H. Valentine of Los Angeles. Val
entine has announced his candidacy,
but reports received from Los Angeles
and vicinity within the past twenty
four hours indicate that his most inti
mate political friends do not hope to se
cure for him sufficient recognition to
justify them in placing his name before
the Assembly. Aside from Mr. Valen
tine's lack of support, the Republican
members of the Assembly believe that
the place should be given to n member
from some northern county, for the
reason that the Governor comes from
the south, and whatever consideration
southern Republicans are entitled to
WiD receive due recognition at hia
hands.
The Democratic members of the lower
house of the Legislature are taking an
active interest in the contest for the
Speakership, for the reason that un
less a fair minded and thoroughly up
right Speaker is selected by the major
ity the minority will receive little or
no consideration in the matter of pro
posed or pending legislation, or in de
bate. The Democratic vote will be
given to a Democratic member, possN
bly A. Caminetti; but it will be purely
complimentary, there being no possibil
ity of the election of a Democrat to
preside over a body the majority of
the members of which are of the oppo
site political faith.
