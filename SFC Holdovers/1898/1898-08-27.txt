Broad Scope of th)Â« Inquiry T^at May Be Com
menced as to Methods in Vogue During
the Recent War.
THE MAN WHOSE STATEMENTS MAY LEAD TO A !
SENSATIONAL CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION. j
". WASHINGTON, Aug. 26.â 1t is not
absolutely certain that a court of in
quiry will be ordered by the President
to investigate the several charges made
as to the mismanagement of the War
;:rtment.
, .If eventually the President sets on
foot, at the suggestion of Secretary Al
" ger, an investigation as to the methods
in vogue during the recent war with
-Spain, it will take a wide scope, with a
view of improving the army of the fu
â¢ ture. The duties of this board would
cover charges of inefficiency against
the heads of bureaus and their subordi
. nates in the field in all branches of the
.service.
The duties of such a board of inquiry
would not conflict with the work of any
â¢ investigating committee that might be
â¢ 'appointed by Congress. The military
â  . board would conduct its investigations
In a strictly military way.
ALGER ON SITUATION

WASHINGTON. Aug. 26.â During the

â¢ pram was received from General Alger
at Montauk Point, in which he said, in

sonably .y. Thf general will

ports Yucatan, Hudson and Gatalina
arrived at M<>ntauk Point to-day with
Several hundred men from Santiago.
The arrival of the ships was reported
to the War Department to-night by
General Wheelor, in command of Camp

SAYS CAMP WIKOFF
â :'. : IS IN GOOD CONDITION
.NEW YORK, Aug. 26.â Secretary Al
ger. arrived in this < ity to-night and is
: at- the Filth-avenue Hotel. In an in
terview he said:
"I did not find the condition of Camp
. Wjkoff nearly as had as I expected. I
cannot see that there is any justifica
tion in the taik that neither the well
nor the sick soldiers are properly
treated. I think there aie splendid ac
commodations for all soldiers who will
go "to Camp Wikoff and especially
now that bo many there have been
piven furloughs. Thursday I received
â  from New York and Hrooklyn
Italfl to take at least 300 sick from
the camp."
rotary Alger was asked: "How do
.you account for the confusion and lack
of facilities at Camp Wikoff?"
To this t;.-neral Alger replied: "Did
you ever PMP M toto camp with 100, or even
fifty, ii. -n? It' S". you know there is
confusion with that number of
men. What do you suppose it must

knows but little about soldiering there
may appear to be much confusion and
privation, but it is only what is to be
expected in roughing it. On many oc- :

quantity in camp and so make beds

not thought of such a thing."
"Then," the Secretary was asked
again, "you cannot see that there is
Justification in the complaints which
have been made?"
"None," he replied. "If there was
any lack of medicines or necessary sup
plies the blame would be on those
whose duty it was to order these things.
The first day I went through the deten
tion hospital and later the general hos
pital, and I talked with nearly every
man who was rrsvake. I said to them
all, "Boys, Is there anything you want?'
They all answered, 'Nothing: we are

Secretary Alger paid affairs vvere not in
condition there, but to the best
of his knowledge, he said, the only men
now there are those who are too ill to
be moved.
OFFICERS APPEAR READY
TO FACE AN INQUIRY
WASHINGTON. Aug. 26. â General
Corhin, Adjutant General of the army,
says no complaint has reached the War
Department from majc-r general, briga
dier general, colonel or men of the army
regarding want or destitution or lack of
supplies for the troops. No demand has
been made for supplies other than the
regular requisitions for troops . which
come in the ordinary routine way. Gen
eral Corbin declines to be interviewed
on the subject of the many stories afloat
regarding destitution and mismanage
ment of the war, saying that the facts
will come out in due time and people^
will then see for themselves what was
done.
The whole department is greatly
stirred up over the many newspaper
accounts of what has been going on,
and It was the subject of discussion
everywhere about the War Depart
ment, but apparently each head of a
bureau believes that an investigation
of the subject will vindicate him and
his department. The officers in Wash
ington say that the accounts of suf
fering have been exaggerated, but
that if there has been suffering further
than the incidentals of war naturally
would bring about, the fault has not
been with the officers in the depart
ment here.
EÂ«ch officer professes to be ready
and willing that there should be an
investigation. Some say it is necessary
and will welcome a complete Congres
sional inquiry, bringing out all the
facts. No official statement is ex
pected in the" absence of Secretary Al
ger, who will return to-morrow.
AS TO SHERMAN
AND GENERAL MILES
NEW YORK, Aug. 26.â Before leav
ing for Washington to-night Secretary
Alger was told that ex-Secretary of
State Sherman had been quoted as
criticizing the management of the War
Department. He admitted that he had
not seen the statements referred to
and refused the characterize them be
yond a meaningless "humph."
Secretary Alger was asked concern
ing the interview with General Miles, in
which the g-eneral is quoted as severely
criticizing the management of affairs in
the War Department. He said bluntly:
"I have seen what was in the papers
about General Miles' reported utter
ances, his demand for an investigation

rHE TWO MEN WHOSE COURSE DURING THE WAR MAY BE THE SUBJECT OF
INVESTIGATION BY CONGRESS.
SENSATIONAL STATEMENT MADE BY
EX-SECRETARY OF STATE SHERMAN
Charges There Was Needless Infliction of Horrible Torture and
Loss of Life Among the American Troopsâ Demands the
Removal of the Responsible Official.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 26. â A local paper publishes the following' interview with ex-
Secretary of State John Sherman, which has thrown Washington official circles into a tur
moil of indignation and consternation:
"The man who is responsible for the mismanagement of the Cuban campaign, result
ing in the needless loss of scores of American soldiers' lives and in the infliction of horrible
tortures upon a thousand brave defenders of their country's honor, should not be in the
Cabinet. The President has power to order an investigation, which can be conducted by a
board of inquiry to be appointed by him. Such board would not have executive power,
and the findings would have a moral rather ffottri a ju<!iiciaÂ« 11 linence. If the board found
that Atnerican soldiers had needlessly suffered and died because of the neglect or incom
petence of an official of the Government, the President, acting upon the verdict rendered,
could remove the official from office. That would be the extent of the punishment under
such conditions. If, however, the President does not order an investigation, Congress holds
the power to impeach the Secretary of War, and can inflict punishment that will mean ever
lasting disgrace in case of conviction. In that case the President would be held equally re
sponsible With the Secretary for not having ordered an inquiry promptly upon the presen
tation of charges of so serious a character.
"In my opinion, the President will find he will be compelled to order an investigation
in self-defense. If the Secretary of War has been guilty of incompetency and neglect, as
has been charged, Air. McKinley cannot afford to sustain him.
"General Miles is a soldier, and, like most soldiers, he is a straightforward and
truthful man. He is no more afraid of an issue than he is of an Indian; and when he
comes to Washington and tells what he knows, an investigation of the War Department
will be inevitable, particularly as he will be corroborated by others who will be entitled to
equal consideration, even if they are not of so exalted a rank."
and charges about withheld and gar
bled messages. I will say frankly that
I don't believe a word of it. I don't be
lieve that he ever said it. A man s en
thusiastic friends get themselves inter
viewed, and he 1b blamed. Now, Gen
eral Miles wanted to go to Santiago. He
had a long talk with the President and
with myself before he started and he
thoroughly understood us and we un
derstood him. He wanted to go to Cuba,
to see 1f he could, by advice or other
wise, help, and he did not go to inter
fere vvith General Shatter, and all this
talk, until I hear differently, I will put
down as untrue."
SOLDIERS CHEERED BY
ALGER'S APPEARANCE
WASHINGTON, Aug. 26.â The Presi
dent has received the following from
General Wheeler:
CAMP WIKOFF, Aug. 26.â President of
the United States: 1 was very glad to
hear that you would visit Monta.uk Point
very soon." The visit of the Secretary
of War baa accomplished more than T
can express. He has promptly corrected
evils mmlf valuable suggestions and
given directions regarding administra-
In addition his personal visits to 1500
Hick po'diers in the hospitals have cheer
<ml them up nnd it is difficult to ade
quately convey to you the change for the
better since the Secretary's arrival. The
announcement that you will visit the sol
diers has already added to this improve
ment and your presence here for even
a single day will accomplish a great ex
tent of good, which you can only realize
after your visit.
ENGLISH COMMENT ON
PEACH COMMISSION
LONDON, Aug. 26.â The Times this
morning, referring editorially to the
American Peace Commission, says:
"The commission is strong in personnel
and in policy, and must be taken to
represent President McKinley's concur
rence in the inclination of the Republi
can party towards a policy of colonial
expansion. The nomination of Mr.
White may be due to the President's
resolve not to ignore the interests and
susceptibilities of the Church of Rome
in the final settlement of the Philippine
subject. If it be true that President
McKinley is, as he seems to be, re
solved to hold something more than
Manila, the logic of the situation will
probably lead him in the end to the oc
cupation of the whole archipelago.
Moreover, bereft of Manila, the Philip
pines would obviously be nothing but a
costly burden which Spain would soon
probably attempt to relieve herself of
in a manner little acceptable to the
United States, especially looking to the
immense war bill Spain has to pay and
the absolute necessity for retrench
ment.
REPEATS THE
DEATH SCENE
OF PETRONIUS
Rev. Mr. Dodge Drinks
a Toast and Expires.
WATCHED OVER BY HIS WIFE
REMAINS OF THE FIRST SPOUSE
TO BEPOSE WITH HIM.
There Were Neither Romans nor
Followers of Nero, but the
Closing of His Life Was
Most Dramatic.
BRUNSWICK, Ga.. Aug. 2Â«.â The
death scene of Petronius in "Quo Va
dis," with slight variations, was enact
ed by the Rev. A. P. Dodge of Fred
erica, as he passed away to-day. Mr.
Dodge was a member of a wealthy New
York family of that name, and turning
from business twenty years ago, en
tered the Episcopal ministry.
While on a trip through India fifteen
years ago his wife died, leaving him
$250,000, with the stipulation that he
was to have her body preserved until
his own death, when they should be
buried together. Bringing the body
back to Frederica, a second wife helped
the preacher to watch over the remains
of the dead one. Last night he was ta
ken ill and a doctor announced that
death was inevitable.
"Will I live fifteen minutes?" asked
the dying man.
"Yes, half an hour," wan the response.
"Then bring out wine and glasses and
we will drink a toast," said he.
The glasses were filled. The dying
man made one supreme struggle as he
arose from his bed, and, holding his
glass aloft, he said:
"Let us drink to the long life and
prosperity for all present, that the
Lord may bless them."
Glasses were drained, the dying man
sank back on the pillow, and a moment
later was dead. His remains will be
buried to-morrow in a plain pine coffin
by that of his first wife

OFFICERS SOLD
DELICACIES SENT
TO SICK SOLDIERS
Sensational Charges Made by the
Hospital Corps oq the
Olivette.
Treatment of tbe Suffering Men Declared to
Have Been Outrageous and the Condi
tions Dan)nable.
BOSTON. Aug. 28.â The hospital
corps of the Red Cross Society on the
Olivette has prepared the following
statement:
"ON BOARD THE OLIVETTE,
Lewie Wharf, Boston, Aug. 25.â We re
quest you to please kindly publish this
as the bearer gives it to you, word for
word, as he was one of the crew on the
Olivette. As to the things put on
board at New York for the sick and
wounded they were never received and
were sold to the officers in charge by
Major Appel, and, in regard to the way
the sick were served it was an outrage.
If you wish for witnesses we are with
him, the whole corps.
"Fred Miller, Harry G. White, John
A. Henderson, J. G. Mihe. Stuart Ward,
Stuart Johnson, Dan Kelley, Frank
Folsom. A. Rudy, O. S. Schlefleld. T.
O. de Deer, John Lunsca, John Wil
liams, John J. Sugal and Sergeant
James Jadet."
Frederick Miller was a seaman on
the Olivette, and had every opportun
ity to observe the men and the treat
ment they received on the trip from
Santiago. He says:
"We left Santiago In a wretched
condition, and the lack of proper food
and the 'treatment on the voyage came
near being disastrous to all the sick
and wounded. I remember that one
man died after we were at sea a few
days, and at present his body is proba
bly floating around. I made a coffin,
lined it with canvas and covered the
outside with tar. No holes were bored
in the box, and after it had been heav
ily weighed Major Appel ordered the
men to throve it overboard. As the
coffin was airtight it did not sink and
will probably float around for months.
"The treatment of the sick and
wounded was outrageous, and it is a
wonder that any survived. Those who
wore able to walk got food from the
sailors and firemen, but all could not
be fed that way. When we arrived at
New York, ice cream, ginger ale and
other delicacies were put on board for
the sick and wounded. The food ajid
drink never reached the soldiers, for
they were sold by Major Appel and his
officers to passengers. When we got
to Moatauk Point what was left of the
ice cream was sour and thrown over
board. The soldiers on the Olivette
suffered from the negligence of the

LONDON, Aug. 27.-The Peking cor
respondent of the Daily Mail says:
The situation has become acute. The
relations between the Tsung Li Ya
men and Sir Claude Macdonald, the
British Minister, are strained to the
point of rupture. Sir Claude Macdon- I
aid has intimated that any failure by
China to observe Great Britain's
wishes will be accepted as a casus

In support of Sir Claude Macdonald
the fleet has been concentrated at Wei

it a policy of spheres of Influence, j

DAMNABLE CONDITIONS
IN CAMP AND ON TRAIN
BOSTON, Aug. 26.â The First Maine
Volunteers reached home to-night. All
the men on the train tell the i^me old
story of mismanagement and ineffi
ciency of the supplies and hospital at
tendance. The conditions at the di
vision hospital are described as a dis
grace to any country pretending to any
kind of military establishment. Men
who needed the most careful treatment
were simply rolled in blankets and left
lying on the damp ground, and at no
time was there a sufficient store of
proper food and medical supplies. The
cars were in just the condition of com
mon emigrant cars, and as inadequate
for the conveyance of sick soldiers as
the hospital accommodations are said
to have been in the Southern camp.
An officer of the regiment who for
obvious reasons could not permit the
use of his name made this emphatic
statement: "The hospitals at the new
md old camps are practically the same.
I am not exaggerating it a bit when I
say the arrangements are damnable.
The greatest lack was in medical at
tendance, skilled surgeons being â 'ew
for so large a number of men. The
Government has also made the great
mistake of not putting in bkilled female
nurses, and the policy of the Govern
ment has been carried out rigidly with
the result that you see all about you on
this troop train lad^n with death."
Chaplain Esterbrook stated that the
great amount of sickness at Chicka
mauga ParK was without doubt due to
two yrtmary- Â©ftus^s*. the /condition of
the camp ground itself, due to the un
favorable unnanitary location in a ma
larial district, and secondarily the in
action of the men. Of course the water
supply was a great cause of typhoid.
It was atrocious.
Lieutenant Atkins of Company D
said: "The ride was one of death. The
district through which we passed was
so sandy that sand blew in the men's
bunks, and finally became so bad we
had to close the doors and ventilators.
This made the conditions practically
unbearable."
tfon to confirm the statement recently
made that a compromise has been ar
rived at between England and Russia,
in accordance with which Russia gets
her way on the railway question and
England gets concessions in other di
rections. The relations between Eng
land and Russia are very satisfactory,
the Russian concessions fully meeting
English wishes.
A special dispatch from Shanghai
says: Violent scenes are reported to
have occurred between Sir Claude
Maodonald, the British Minister and
M. Pavloff, the Russian Charge d'Af
faires, owing to th< ; latter's command
ing the Tsung Li Yamen to revoke its
agreement with the Hongkong Bank
under pain of the Czar's strong dis
pleasure. The Chinese are inclined to
obey M. Pavloff, seeing that the Brit
ish confine themselves to verbal pro
tests. The position is now worse than
ever. All the Russian ships have re
turned to Port Arthur, while the Brit
ish vessels are assembling at Wei Hai
Wei and Chefu. Extreme activity
prevails ashore at Port Arthur The
action of the Russians at New Chwang
indicates an intention orr their part to
remain there in strong force whether
they build the Tien Tsin Railway or
not.

ONLY SEVENTEEN DEATHS.
Loss of American Troops Through
Illness at Manila.
LONDON, Aug. 27.â The correspondent
of the Times at Manila, telegraphic Fri

Among the American troops there have
been only seventeen deaths from illness
since landing. Twenty-three thousand
stand of arms, 10,000,000 cartridges and an
immense quantity of large ammunition
have been surrendered, with nearly 15,000
prisoners.
There Is undoubtedly practical unanim

Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. Aug. 26.â The Cabi
net was in session two hours to-day
and devoted a large share of the time
to matters which will come before the
peace commission.
At the adjournment of the meeting
Secretary Day announced that four
members of the commission had been
selected. Secretary Day, Senators Frye J
and Davis and Whitelaw Reid.
As to the fifth member of the com- i
mission no definite announcement could j
be made. Justice White's acceptance j
not having at that time been received, j
The membership of the commission
being completed. Secretary Day ar
ranged to leave for Canton to-morrow, i
In order to make his personal prepara- j
tions for the trip to Paris. He will be
accompanied abroad by Mrs. Day, who
has entirely recovered from her recent
illness. The Secretary has already
chipped to Canton a number of fris per
sonal effects in anticipation of his early
retirement from the head of the State
Department.
Assistant Secretary Moore to-night
admitted his selection as secretary of
the commissk 1. He said he had not
decided on when he would resign his
position as Assistant Secretary of State,
but that it would probably be within
a fortnight. He had a long conference
with the President this afternoon.
The following attaches of the peace
commission have been selected and will
be appointed by the President: John :
Moore of Massachusetts, now Assistant j
Secretary of State, to be secretary of j
the commission, and J. W. Mac Arthur |
of New York to be assistant secretary, j
Mr. Mac Arthur was formerly first sec- j
retary of the United States legation at i
Madrid and is now on special duty at '
the State Department. He has had con- |
glderable experience in work of a 'dip- j
lomatic nature. These appointments !
were decided on by the President this j
afternoon.
JUSTICE WHITE
RELUCTANTLY ACCEPTS
NEW YORK, Aug. 26.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald tel
egraphs: Justice White of the Su
preme Court of the United States has
reluctantly accepted the appointment
as member of the commission to ar
range the terms of peace with Spain.
Th* reason for his reluctance was that
two members of the Supreme Court,
Chief Justice Fuller and Justice Brew
er, are members of the Venezuela Ar- j
bltration Commission and will probably !
be absent much of the time during the
next session of the court. Justice White
doubted the advisability of having still
another member of the court absent
from the bench, and this consideration
led him at first to decline the appoint
ment. He considered his declination as
final, but the President and all the
members of the Cabinet united in urg
ing him to reconsider his determination
and the President this evening received
a message from him accepting the place
on the commission.
The commissioners and attaches will
gall for Paris on September 15, and, in
cluding the ladies who will accompany
them, will number about thirty.
SPAIN CONSIDERING
DISPOSITION OF TROOPS
Bagasta Thinks Those That Capitu
lated at Manila Should Go to
the \iscayas Islands.
MADRID. Aug. 26.â The Cabinet was in
Â«ession again to-day. Senor Segasta said
the Government was principally occupied
with the disposition of the troops that
had capitulated at Manila. It would be
better, be thought, to transport them to
the Viscayas Islands than to bring them
home, hut the question must be decided
by agreement with the American Gov
ernment. It depended upon whether or
not the troops were considered prisoners
of war.
The Spanish army officers who arriv
ed on the steamer Alicante, which reach
ed Corunna on the 24th inst. with the first
of the Spanish repatriated soldiers, were
given a banquet by representatives of
the Madrid press. The officers declare
that both the American and Spanish na
tions adhered to the methods of civil
ized warfare throughout the campaign
They concede the superiority of Ameri
can artillery. The health of the troops
which arrived on the Alicante is already
greatly improved.

j gilist. died at the Norwegian Hospital

' brought on by his exertions in his fight
j with Tommy Butler at the Greenwood
Athletic Club, Brooklyn, last night.
Scott was a brakeman on the Long
| Island Railroad, 25 years old. and leaves
[ a widow and two children. He had made
; no proper preparation to meet Butler last |
' night, and It is declared by the physi
| clans that his kidneys were in bad condi
tion before he entered the ring. The ex-
I citement. heat and his exertions brought
on a series of uraemic convulsions, to ,
whtc h he succumbed. Butler and his sec
onds are under arrest.
Dr. J. P. Hart, the physcian to the
Greenwood Athletic Club, said that Scott
was in perfect condition when he entered
the ring. He said the probable cause of
his death was concussion of the brain.

showed the fatigue of this terrible exer
tion and the heat, and he was knocked
j down four times, falling on his head on
i the hard-wood floor.

magistrate, charged with manslaughter,
and remanded In the sum of $500. The
court denied a motion to dismiss on the
ground of insufficient proof that a crime
had been committed. The magistrate

and the laws on boxing, no man has any
right to inflict punishment that will kill.

of the club, the president of the club and
the alleged matchmakers of the club, were
all held in $1000 for examination on Tues
day. The prisoners, with the exception of ,

SEATTLE, Wash., Aug. 26.â News
reached here this afternoon of the
wrecking: of the bark Guardian on the
rocks off Tigaldo Island, Alaska. No
lives were lost. Captain Eagles and the
crew took to the lifeboats and pulled
through the fog twenty-three miles to
I'nalaska. The Guardian will undoubt

The steamer Laurada arrived this af

KAGUAY, Alaska, Aug. 18. via Vic

special postal commissioner for

Michael, via Juneau, in the gunboat
eeling, after a Journey of over 10,000

lished a great many new offices and for
the interior Alaskan towns between
Juneau andTanana he has arranged for
a twice a month mail, and for the .towns
between St. Michael and Tanana a
monthly mail. This service is to be
maintained throughout the entire year,
tter and summer. Mr. Clum says

ajor J. M. Walsh, the Yukon Com
missioner, w r ho has been succeeded by
Mr. Ogilvie, the former Dominion Sur
veyor, is in the city awaiting the ar
rival of his successor, who is expected
in a few days. Major Walsh said to
day that the collection of the royalty
was a matter optional with him and in
ail matters he was granted great lati
tude; that he was empowered to amend
the existing mining laws and in some
instances he did change and modify
them to suit the exigencies of the oc
casion. Concerning the collection of the
royalty the major vehemently re
marked: "I never enforced the collec
tion of the royalty from any man who
was not able to pay the royalty many
times over. The law was only enforced
! against the men who Were able to pay
it â the rich mine owners."
VICTORIA, B. C, Aug. 26.â The
steamer City of Topeka arrived this
afternoon from Alaskan points, bring
ing among her passengers Postal In
spector Clum, who is returning from a
tour of Alaska Territory. A brother
of Major Walsh was also a passenger.
The major was still at Skaguay await
ing the arrival of Commissioner Ogil
vie. The passengers confirm the
statement of the richness of the Pine
Creek diggings. There is a shortage
of supplies inevitable at Dawson this
winter. But few cargoes have been
received via St. Michael, and the boats
from Lake Bennett can make only
about three more trips.
Commissioner Livernash addressed a
meeting after his return from Ottawa,
indicating that he had received no en
couragement to expect a removal of
royalties on the output now levied by
the Dominion Government. Many peo
ple are getting away from Dawson,
wages are decreasing and the pros
pects for a hard winter, unless relief
of some kind is provided, are decidedly
serious.
The charges made against Commis
sioner Pawcett are said to be incom
petency and the postal officials are
cleared of any boodllng.

SAVED BY . PLUCK AND LUCK.
William K. Vanderbilt Jr. Has a
Narrow Escape From Drowning.
NEWPORT, R. 1., Aug. 26. Pluck and
luck saved "William K. Vanderbilt Jr.
from being drowned in Newport harbor,
where his half-rater was caught in a
nasty squall and went over, tossing
young Vanderbilt and his captain into
the water. They managed to right the
little boat and clambered aboard again,
but twice afterward she was capsized.
The pair clung to her, and at last man
aged to reach shore, greatly exhausted.
The alarm was great on shore, where
the peril of young Vanderbilt was first
seen by the soldiers at Fort Adams, and
no one believed he would come out of
the squall alive.
Mr. Vanderbilt, as well as his com
panion, was pretty nearly done for, but
the sight of help coming gave them new
life, and they made qne more effort to
get the half-rater right side up. Before
the soldiers could reach them ihey suc
ceeded in doing this, and got her into
the wind and made for Newport. Wil
liam K. Vanderbilt Jr. is an under-grad
uate at Harvard University. During the
summer, with his brother, Harold, he
has been at the Marble House, Newport.

GENERAL BLANCO'S
LATEST PROCLAMATION
Advises the Spaniards in Cuba tc
Bow to the Will of the
Victors.
NEW YORK, Aug. 26.-A special to tht
Press from Washington says: A trans
lation of General Blanco's latest procla
mation to the people of Havana has
reached Washington. It says:
"We have been vanquished, and with
out consideration of our birthplace, will
be to-morrow as strangers in this coun
try and emigrants to this portrlon of the
world, which is to-day, and perhaps for
but a few weeks more, a part of our
Spanish fatherland. As strangers and
the vanquished, I counsel you, the peo
ple of Cuba, who deeply feel the dis
grace of their country, not to dispute any
of the benefits which the triumph gives
to the victors.
"It is our obligation now tÂ© be quiet,
not to take part in the different mani
festations of a local political nature, and
even to decline participation in such af
fairs, even if the right of franchise be
offered us. But we have one duty which
should be a duty of love; that Is to un
tertake the task of reconstructing all
your interests, and it is your duty also
to ask for, even appeal if it becomes
necessary, from your position as the van
quished to the victorious, for a guaran
tee of your personal safety and the pro
tection of your proper interests.
"If you do as I counsel you, the United
States will take care of your lives and
your interests. My mission here soon will
be finished, as will be the sovereignty of
Spain, and any one who feels that with
honor to himself he may continue to call
himself a Spaniard, will have to matri
culate his name at the Spanish Consu
late which will be established in this
city.
"I believe that I have done all that I
could have done for her Majesty's loyal
subjects. It was duty to make war
against the Insurgents, who have never
been grateful to Spain for her efforts in
their behalf. I am convinced that there
will bfÂ» no further disputes between the
Cubans and the Spaniards in the island,
for it is my belief that as soon as the
Cubans begin to govern here they will
find out how useful are the Spaniards
to them, and finally will concede to them
the place they deserve in the government
of the island. Your companion,
"RAMON BLANCO."

CROWDS CHEER
ADMIRAL SCHLEY
One Naval Hero Receives
an Ovation.
ENTHUSIASM AT WASHINGTON
UPON ARRIVAL THE OFFICEB
CONFERS WITH McKINLEY.
; Describes the Great Battle of July 3,
and Discusses the Work of the
Porto Rican Peace Com
mission.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
"WASHINGTON, Aug. 26.â Rear Ad
miral Winfield S. Schley reached Wash
| ington this afternoon over the Pennsyl
! vania railroad. He was quickly noticed
' at almost all of the stations along the
| line, and throughout the trip was
] greeted with cheering crowds. "When
the train pulled into the depot here he
found a compact mass of spectators,
which filled the depot and overflowed
out into the train shed. The admiral
and Mrs. Schley, when they appeared,
were greeted with cheers and shouts of
I "Hurrah for Schley."
Everybody Joined in the shouting,
and the depot attaches crowded about
the admiral and insisted on a hand
shake. At the gates the crowd in
creased, and, amid deafening cheers,
the admiral and his wife, the former
with his hat off, passed through two
solid lines of people. A lieutenant and
squad of police with difficulty cleared
a passage way to the carriage whi_sh
was in waiting. Through a mass of
vehicles that had been drawn up by
curious drivers the hansom pulled into
Pennsylvania avenue and proceeded di
rectly to the Shoreham Hotel. There
were groups of cheerers all the way,
and a cavalcade of enthusiasts formed
a voluntary escort.
The admiral stayed only a few min
utes at the hotel and then drove over
to the Navy Department, where, with
out any preliminaries, he reported di
rectly to Acting Secretary Allen. The
latter accompanied him over to the
White House, reaching there at 4:50
o'clock.
The President gave him a most cor
dial reception. The President thanked
the admiral, as he had Admiral Samp
son, for the success of that memorable
engagement of July 3, and took occa
sion to say that it was that battle
which brought about the surrender of
Santiago. The President thanked him
on behalf of himself and the nation for
his brilliant services on that day, and
asked him to describe the battle, which
the admiral did at length.
The President entered into a
discussion of the -work of the Porto
Rican commission, to which the ad
miral had been appointed. He went
over with him the general instructions
which will guide that body in arrang
ing for the evacuation by the Spanish
of the Island and other work. Dur
ing most of the conference, which oc
cupied about an hour. Assistant Secre
tary of State Moore was present.
On leaving the President Admiral
Schley drove to the hotel.
Many of the friends of Admiral and
Mrs. Schley learned of their presence
at the hotel and called during the even
ing. Although considerably better, he
is not well, and said to-night he ex
pected to leave here to-morrow to
visit relatives in Maryland, which
probably will consume several days,
after which he will go to Connecticut
to remain until about to start for
Porto Rico.
The admiral during the evening
talked briefly of some of the incidents
of the fight which led to the destruc
tion of Cervera's squadron. He said:
"It is my opinion that the Spanish
admiral might have escaped with pos
sibly one or two of his ships had he
adopted different tactics in coming out
of the harbor. Had he diverted the
course of his ships, sending some of
them east and others to the west, it is
my belief that he might have escaped
with one, or possibly tw r o of the ves
sels. Such a course naturally would
have compelled us to separate our fleet,
and some of Cervera's ships might
have been able to have reached
Havana." ________________

FAVOR OF EXPANSION
Expressed His Views in an Indirect Fashion on
Board the China in a Fourth of July
Address to His Command.
NEW YORK. Aug. 26.â A Denver special to the Herald says:
Brigadier General Greene Is on record for holding the Philippines. A
letter received here this evening gives a verbatim report of his speech.
It was on the occasion of the Fourth of July exercises that soldiers
aboard the China -were given lirst opportunity of hearing the voice
of their brigade commander, General Francis V. Greene, who ad
dressed them from the rail of the promenade deck. He was cheered
to the echo as he stepped up snd greeted the assembly as "Fellow
soldiers ajid comrades." He said in part:
"When Thomas Jefferson wrote the immortal words which you
have just heard read, he little dreamed that 122 years later they
would be read in the middle of the Pacific to an expedition of Ameri
can soldiers bound to the conquest of a group of islands off the coast
China. Yet the vigor with which Jefferson acted in acquiring
Louisiana proves that were he alive to-day he would be the first to
seize the opportunities which Admiral Dewey's glorious victory in
Manila Bay have placed within our grasp. In Jefferson's mind there
â would be no hesitation as to our duty to hold the Philippines and
accept the destiny which has been suddenly thrust upon us."

SILVER PARTY IS DOMINANT
"'NOMINATION EQUIVALENT TO

Governor Sadler Hopes to Succeed
' : Himself, but His Opponents
Are Saying Many Mean
â¢ .- Things of Him.
' : ; Special Dispatch to The Call.
;â¢ REN'O, Nev., Aug. 26.â The political
â¢ â¢.pot in Nevada has commenced to warm
Up. Even now, with but one primary
'election held (thafc of the Silver party)
â¢â¢' the political temperature in the shade
'". h:akes that of the arid, sun-scorched
..'Nevada desert seem like a cool summer
Presort. The Silver party in this State
â¢ feels so strong that, in the assumed ab
! -sprice of a real contest with any other
'.political party, they think they >. m af
:. "ford to have a red-hot fight among
â  themselves. The production of silver is
looked upon as a home industry, and I
; .Yhe party feeis no doubt about making I
.the peopl- believe that "the free and \
. .unlimited," etc., is still a live issue, 'â 
. that its adoption would prove a god- !
send, to the State, and, therefore, it does j
â  net anticipate any trouble In electing
â  all of its candidates.
. . It has not occurred to the leaders as I
â¢â â¢yet that "they cannot fool all the peo- :
â â¢ pie ail the time." or that it might be far
cheaper to the country at large to make |
the silver-producing Slates a present to j
.the value of all the silver they might
â¢ produce to the end of time and keep a
good currency, than to adopt their
harum-scarum plan in order to give
. their home product a value which does i
â  not belong to it.
With unshaken confidence in its abil
â¢ ity to elect whomsoever it nominates
' the silver party convention will assem- i
ble here on September 8, with three
active, hopeful candidates for guber- :
â  natoriai honors and almost ax; equal '
numfcer of prospective candidates for
â¢ each of the oilier places to be rilled. Up
to. about three weeks ago It was '
â¢' thought that Governor Sadler would
â¢ have little or no opposition, but as the
â¢..primaries came on and the talk about
.â¢.his favors to prize-fighters and lack of
Interest in and support for the State
University and other State institutions '
crystallised, and since his best friends
" could not deny that he proposed to
keep Bergstein at the asylum and sup
;'port Jones against Fitzgerald for the
"Judgeship, a very definite opposition
\ made its appearance, with the result,
as indicated by the returns, that he was
. "turned down" in Washoe County to
" the tune of about 19 to 1, in Ormsby 10
. to Iâshort,1 â short, that in all probability he
will not h%ve a single solid delegation,
. not even Eureka, where he claims resi
.dence, and that he will fall far short
lor the required plurality in the coir. |
tion. The Governor came down from
. .Carson apparently to see what had
struck him. He found plenty of fences
. .to mend, but took an optimistic view
.of the situation and hoped for better
â¢ luck at the convention. He is said to
'. have asked '"what the strained rela
".tions between Germany and America
had to do with politics in Nevada?"
â¢ without having received a satisfactory
/ reply. .
'â¢; â¢ The anti-Sadler delegates seem to
"- be divided in their choice of the best :
mar. to beat him with between Evan i
. Williams, Lem Allen and A. C. Cleve
land. The mere mention of Evan Wll
â¢\ Hams' name has brought to the front
: so many vivid recollections of him
:. and "his little buckboard" in the Hale
â¢'& - .Norcross case, and his connection
' .-â¢with the Carson mint scandal in 1894,
. -.all of which so far redound to every - j
.-.thing except glory or honor to him,
that his friends have found themselves
.unable to stay by their guns or to draw
the main opposition to Sadler their !
â  way.
. A. C. Cleveland, the alleged Silver
â¢ Republican, once infa^ou3 for his bolt
out of the National Republican Con- !
â  vention in St. Louis in 1596. has many
. friends among the delegates, but it
.seems to be an open r-uectlon whether
â¢ the majority wish to make him a can- i
;â¢ didate against Sadler for Governor, or i
â¢ against Stewart for United States Sen- '
ator. Many think that he is the only
â¢ man who would have any chance j
against Stewart, since Newlands has
â¢decided not to make the contest and
that he should be supported for that
. place in order to keep Stewart on the ,
anxious seat and in a generous mood i
Lem Allen will find strong support in |
the convention, Washoe County stand- !
ing almost as a unit for him. About the i
worst that has been said against him i
is that he has not had the benefit of !
anything extra in the way of education.
â¢and does not understand all the advan
tages that should be offered to the
youth of to-day at the State Univer
sity.
â  â¢It was hoped by many that Francis
G. Newlands would put up a fight I
against Stewart for the United States
Senatorship, but it peems definitely
settled that he prefers the sure thing
of a seat in the House, to a contest for j
. the hitrher honor.
There are so many "bees in so many
bonnets" for the other places on the
ticket that prabable candidates cannot
be guessed at.
The Silver, Democratic and Populist
conventions all come Inside the same
| -weekâ September 7, 8 and 10 â presum
j ably in the interest of general harmony
and convenience in arranging matters
between the three.

NAVAL RESERVE
MEN INDIGNANT
Will Be Mustered Out of
the Navy To-Day.
EXPECTED TO SERVE A YEAR
CHICAGO CONTINGENT WILL BE
SENT _lOME.
Many of the Men Went Into Debt in
Order to Purchase Outfits and
Have Only Served Two
Months.
The United States steamers Iroquois, i
Vigilart and Active will be manned to- I
day by officers and enlisted men from the i
navy, and the naval reserve boys
who wanted to seek fame at the â¢
cannon's mouth will return to pri- i
vate life. Lieutenant Turner of the j
Iroquois will resume command of the na
val battalion, while Lieutenants Shaw
and Gunn of the Active and Vigilant wiil
take up their uid duties on the naval re
serve steamer Marion.
The members of the Chicago Naval Re
serve, who came as far as Mare Island
on their way to join Admiral Dewey's
fleet in front of Manila, are to be bun
ii!eu into cars and sent homo. On their
arriv.il there they will be mustered out
of the service.
There is a vigorous protest from the boys !
who are to be mustered out. Some of th.c
officers are glad of it, but the great ma
jority are angry clean through, and with
;ause. Very few have good places await- I
ing them and are actually out of pocket j
by remaining in Uncle Sam's service. The j
majority are in debt, and will have to |
hunt a job as soon as the naval reserve j
Is mustered out of service.
"The facts of the case are just these."
â aid one of the men yesterday. "When i
Uncle Sam Issued a call for men. with a â¢
great many others I hastened to offer my i
services. We enl!sj<3l with the expecta- !
tions of having to serve at least a year, J
and all of us purchased a full outrit.
Borne of us borrowed the money with
Which to pay for our things, and others j
went into debt to the Government for :
theirs. Well, here we are mustered out
after two months of service, without a !
job and our outfits on our hands. Of j
course, the men who got their things i
from Uncle Sam will simply walk out and j
leave them behind them, but we who paid
for our things can keep them as a me
mento of our naval duty in the service
of the United States. The least the Gov
ernment might have done was to keep us
with the purchased sieamers until our
term of service was up. "
The men on the Iroquois. Vigilant and
Active are making Rome howl, but their
noise is nothing compared with the out
cry from the Chicago contingent. The
men on the dispatch boats nave seen
some service. The Iroquois has been on
a cruise down the coast in search of a
derelict, the Active is now on Puget
Sound and the Vigilant has done duty be
tween here and the navy yard, but the
Chicago boys have done nothing but eat
their heart's out aboard the receiving
ship Independence. They have not even
been given a chance to see San Fran
cisco, and their wrath knows no bounds.
It is their intention as soon as they reach
Chicago to lay the matter before their
Cnnsrrt-ssmen and have them enter j. vig
orous protest with the Government. ThÂ»y
have not been given a chance to see any
thing of the war, not even the departure
of the troopships. Fifteen dollars a
month Is a poor salve to their wounded
dignity. T.ie war has just begun anil the
firrt gun will be fired to-day when re
f.-rve men are replaced by enlisted men
and the Chicago boys start for home.
STANFORD'S NIECES
AND NEPHEWS WIN
SUPREME COURT PASSES ON
TAXING INHERITANCES.
The Same Opinion Includes the Uni
versity â A Saving of Money to

The Supreme Court has reversed tlie
j decision and judgment of the Superior
j Court of this city in the matter of im
1 posing an Inheritance tax on the neph
ews and nieces of the late Leland Stan
j ford, as well as upon the property of the
i Stanford University. Among the be
j quests in the will of Senator S'anford was
J that of the university, valued at $2,500,000.
j He a.so bequeathed to his nephews and
I nieces various sums amounting to $2,200,-
I 000. The Superior Court, under the act of
j the Legislature of 1533, directed the execu
j trix of the estate to pay into the city
| treasury the sum of $25,750 for the col
lateral inheritance tax, but the benefi
ciary relatives appealed from that order
i in 1896, and it was on this appeal that the
' Supreme Court ruled as stated. The court
â  sets forth that while the matter was
i still pending the Legislature of March Â°.
j 1597, passed an act exempting from the
! payment of all collater.ii inheritance
1 taxes a "niece or nephew when a resident
j of this State."
The Supreme Court, in meeting the con
j tention of the appellant relatives and the
university, holds that in accorance witn
: the provisipns of section 2 of article IV of
! the constitution of the United States,
; which declares, "The citizens of each
i State shall be entitled to all privileges
; and immunities of citizens in die several
â  States," the imposit n of the tax is mi
i valid. It says: "The charge imposed
I upon the Inheritance by the statute under
i consideration is in the nature of an ex
! cize tax, but by whatever name it is dcs
! ignaied, the power to impose the charge
â  is referable to the power of taxation, and
1 the abovo provision of the constitution
guarantees to the citizens of each State
an immunity in any other State from
! the burdens of taxation upon their per
! sons or property or occupations which
I that State does not impose upon the per
' sons or property or occupations of its own
i citizens. â¢ â¢ â¢
â¢ â¢ â¢ "It must be held, therefore, that
â  It is not within the power of the State,
i while exempting its own citizens from a
] tax upon their inheritances, to impose
such tax upon the inheritances falling to
| citizens of other States.
"That the Legislature intended that
i the exemption should extend to nephews
I and nieces resident in this State is cvi
! dent from its language, and that it did
not Intend that the exemption should ex
' tend to nephewÃ and nieces not resident
iin this State is equally evident. But its
intention In this latter respect failed by
reason of its want of power to make such
discrimination between the two classes.
"It is not contended by the respondent
t'nat the bequest to the Leland Stanford
i University Is subject to the tax if the
provision making such exemption appli
cable to past cases is vaild. Â» â¢ â¢
"The order is reversed and the Superior
Court is directed to make its order for the
payment of the tax in conformity with
j the opinion."
QUITCLAIMS 808 UP.
San Francisco Property Owners
Again Buying Experience.
The lawyers who seek to disquiet ti
tles to San Francisco property by rak
ing up ancient Spanish and Mexican
claims are again in evidence In this city,
as is shown by the almost dally filing
of quit-claim deeds during the past two
weeks from certain Eastern parties to
various property -owners here, giving up
all right, title and interest in whole
blocks of San Francisco real estate for
the nominal sum of $500 in each case. It
is not in evidence that the purchasers of
these quit-claims paid in every case $500
for their papers, but the lawyers' public
price is the sum quoted.
The old-time practice has been to work
upon the fears of small property-owners,
who have no means to fipht law suits,
and to tell them that the safest thing to
do, to avert all trouble in the future, is
to purchase a quit-claim from the de
scendants of the old Spanish or Mexl-.
can owners, who, by some hocus-pocus,
failed to deed their property away in a
legal manner before their deaths, so that
the families of these ancient gentlemen
still have recourse in the courts of law.
No mention of the statute of limitation
is made by the lawyers handling thes*
cases, but the nightmare of endless liti
gation is allowed to do its work on the
mind of the timid owner of the property.
For some time past this sort of prac
tice has been dropped, largely as a re
sult of the United States District Court
decision delivered by Justice Field, put
ting a quietus on these antiquated claims,
but it now seems that the memory of
the court's decision has sufficiently faded
away to allow the lawyers Interested in
this sort of business to resume opera-
tions.
On August 3 David Houston of New
York through his attorney, John K.
Moore, deeded by quit-claim to Michael
McCann a trifle of four blocks of San
Francisco real estate, Nos. 248, 251. 252
and 253. for the sum of $2000, or just JSOO
per block. Since then various quit-claims
to blocks have been given to local par
ties.
Yesterday afternoon thf latest paper of
this class was presented for record, it
was from the same David Houston of
New York, through Attorney Moore, to
Charles G. Butler, for the block bounded
by Alma, Clayton, Rivoii and Cole
streets, the usual consideration of $500
being named.
WOODMEN DELEGATES
STILL AT WORK
THEY RECOGNIZE THE WOMEN
OF WOODCRAFT.
A MovÂ«ment to Create an Equaliza
tion Fund â Another Head
Camp Officer Proposed
Reunion To-Day.
Luring the forenoon session of the
Head Camp of the' Woodmen of the
World, Pacific Coast jurisdiction, yester
day, there was presented a resolution to
create an additional Head Camp officer,
to be known as Head Camp editor, whose
duty it shall be to edit thy official organ.
The matter was referred to a commit
tee.
By unanimous vote it was decided, amid
great enthusiasm, to recognize the Pacific
jurisdiction of the Women of Woodcraft
as the only auxiliary of the Pacific Juris
diction of the Woodmen of the World.
The adoption was greeted with three j
cheers and a tiger.
Past Head Consul Cooper, Head Escort
Siillman, Head Physician Hughes. Head
Clerk Browning and Head Managers j
Hanley and Baird were appointed a com- j
mlttee to notify the Grand Circle of the j
action of the Head Camp. The ladies j
received the report with manifestations
of great joy. The seven delegates also
walked out of the Supreme Circle h*ld
at at. Louis and who organized the Paci- ,
fie Circle, namely, Mrs. Carrie C. Van
Ordsdall, Mrs. Helen M. Southwick, Mrs.
Anna P. Hawkins. Mrs. O. A. Grlmshaw,
Miss Inez Tillson, J. L. Wright and J.
M. Doretv, were then escorted to the
Head Camp and there they acknowledged
the honor conferred. On entering the j
camp the founders of the Women of i
Woodcraft were received with cheer aftf-r
cheer. The grand guardian. Mrs. Van
Ordsdall, delivered a brief and eloquent
speech on behalf of the circle in which
she accepted the tender of recognition.
Head Consul Falkenburg made reply in
which he depicted the future of the two
brunches of the order. At the close of
his remarks the official union was made
complete and then there was a recess and
an informal recentlon which the head
consul characterized as "a good old-fash
ioned love feast."
During the afternon the different com- j
mittires were busy discussing the several
amendments proQpsed, one of the most
important of wh!<*h was a proposition for I
the creation of an equalization fund. The !
ommlttee'.- report will be presented at
the next seHslon on Monday morning.
The Grand Circle of the Women of
Woodcraft was engaged nearly all day
in the consideration of changes in the
by-laws.
To-day all the Head Camp officers, the
delegates and the officers and delegates to
the Grand Circle will go to San Lorenzo
Grovr; where they will be the guests at
a rounkm given by the local camps and
thos~ of Oakland anil Alameda.
WHICH STATE HAS
JURISDICTION?
A Legal Opinion on Tv/o
Phases of the Botkin
Case.
A prbminent attorney expresses the fol
lowing- as his opinion on the questions of
jurisdiction and extradition in the case
of Mrs. Botkin:
"In this case, t*e it stand 6at present,
the defendant is held merely upon a pre- j
liminary accusation awaiting extradition |
papers from Delaware. What the result j
will be upon the arrival of those papers
can only do determined by an inspection
of the papers themselves.
"In this case two phases of the matter
are presented. The conflict ot jurisdiction
between the courts of this State and Dela- ;
ware involves the determination of :
two important propositions. namely;
Tht- law of the place of the commission of
the crime and th' Jurisdiction of the j
courts wherein it may be tried.
"Even with these two questions out of i
the way and settled in favor of the a.v- j
thorlties of the State of Delaware the I
Important and essential element of ex- j
tradition cannot be concluded alone from
these considerations. To determine the
question of extradition will require the
C ostructlon and interpretation of provi- ]
sions of the constitution and laws of the '
United States and the decision upon this
Question may be demanded from the Fed
eral courts if it is desired.
"If it should be concluded that the
courts of Delaware have Jurisdiction of
trial over the of&ons<- which is now
charged in the courts of that State, It
is by no means clear that the process of
interstate extradition could be accom
plished.
"As I understand it the Supreme Court
of the United States has held It neces
sary to the extradition of an accused per
son from one State to another that the
terms of the article of the Federal con
stitution from which proceeding is de
rived must be construed in its entirety
and that the essential element contained I
in 'he article of the constitution must |
exist before the extradition can be carried !
out. That is to say. a person to bo ex
tradited from one State to another must
have been in the State seeking extradi
tion and has fled from that St&to and is
a fugitive from Justice."
MAY DELAY
EXTRADITION
Delaware Officials to Collect
the Affidavits Wanted
by Lees.
DOVER. Del.. Aug. 26â The demnrifis
of the San Francisco police for additional j
affidavits will cause a further delay In
the bringing of Mrs. Botkin East. The
telegram from the Chief of Police of San
Francisco was received by Attorney Gen
eral White at his home in Georgetown
this afternoon, and he telegraphed that
he would be here to-morrow to prepare I
all of the additional material that is j
necessary to comply with the new de- ;
mands.
The requisition papers were sent away
yesterday^ by registered letter, addressed
to State Detective McVey, who will arrive
in San Francieco Sunday. The only docu- j
ments accompanying the requisition were !
the certificate of the Deputy Attorney
General and the warrant of arrest sworn
to by ex-Congressman Pennln-ton, the i
father of the two murdered women. The
only other material In the hands of McVuy
is the attested transcript of the evidence
taken before the Coroner's Jury.
This includes the testimony oi the phy
sicians who attended the women, which j
covers much of the ground specified by
the San Francisco Chief of Police. It
Will now be necessary for the Attorney â¢
General to collect the affidavits of Post- I
master Gooden. who received the poisoned
packet, little Harry Pennington, who took
It to the house, and the others that were !
made ill by oatlr.p the candy. These can I
all be procured in a single day. and they
will be forwarded to San Francisco not '
later than to-morrow evening.

HE DISPOSES
OF HIS DOGS
Extravagant Pastime of
E. V. Sullivan.
P. J. 6. KENNA THE BUYER
THE YOUNG COURSING PATRON
IS KISSED.
Leashmen Fear That This Will Re
sult in the Breaking Up
of the Menlo
Kennels.
Emmet V. Sullivan has sold his dogs.
The young coursing man, who has latter
ly come Into prominence as a follower of
the fleet hounds and the fast hares, has
disposed of his kennels in their entirety
to his uncle, P. J. G. Kenna. Sullivan
went into the sport of coursing with
about Uie same soeed with which he has
gone out. Peg after dogâ all of fine stock
and rare breedingâ was rapidly added to
his kennels, which soon won the reputa
tion, both for number and value, as the
finest on the coast. And now nothing re
mains to Sullivan but a memory of me
big iigure he cut in dogdom.
About two weeks ago Mr. Sullivan was
missed by the coursing contingent. iÂ±e
then fell from the paths that leashmen
frequent. The cause of his absence was
not then known, and none of his oid-time
pals of the heatner hazarded a dream that
Sullivan was soon to withdraw from the
game which he had helpeu to make so
popular. The sale of nis hounds to his
uncle, P. J. G. Kenna, came as a surp.isc
to them.
Sullivan has betn an extravagant
patronizer of :he sport. New kenne.s at
the Union Park and new kennels at Memo
consumed a great deal of his spare money
and all of his time. The dogs drew heav
ily on his purse strings. At Menio Par<c
he erected the most modern improved
kennels and everything appertaining
thereto. Trainers and keepers were sup
plied and every detail received full at
tention. Judge Bell was formerly in
charge at Menlo, but since the advent or
the avuncultr power P. J. Riiey has been
made the- directing superintendent.
The dogs belonging to the bullivan Ken
nels will be run in the courses to-day
without any change. Leashmen fear that
the kennels will not be kept up by the >Ir.
Kenna who has relieved his nephew of the
expensive pastime of capturing the elus
ive hare and supporting a herd of iast
moving animals? of the caiine ordr-r.
Where Emmot V. Sullivan has gone to
none of the coursing men setm to know.
They fear that he ia out of the sport for
all time and that his dogs may not be in
dividualized as members of the great Sul
livan kennels in the future. Emmet v.
Sullivan's meteoric career as the patron
of the classic sport has ended.
ANNIVERSARY JINKS
OF LOCAL ELKS
SAN FRANCISCO LODGE ENTER
TAINS ITS FRIENDS.
Captain Smith of the City of Peking
Tells of Meeting With Dewey
at Manila.
San Francisco Lodge No. 3. Benevolent
Protective Order of Elks, after the close
of Its business meeting in Elks' Hall, held
a jinks In celebration of its anniversary.
There were present many of the members
and after the doors were thrown open
many not members of the order, who

Smith of the City of Peking, a member cf
the order, was in attendance, r.nd In re
sponse to a call addressed the meeting,
telling of his meeting with Rear Admiral
Dewey, the hero of Manila Bay. He said
that there never was a man on ship or
fhore who had so much endeared himself
to the people as Dewey, and every one in
Manila and vicinity has the highest ad
miration for him. He told a number of
Interesting stories about the progress of
the war, and added the information that
the rear admiral said that he is anxious
to return to the United States, having ac
complished what he was sent to do.
"He will," said Captain Smith, "no
doubt return with me when I come here
again from Manila, for he, as I am my
self, is of the opinion that there Is no
ship afloat like the City of Peking. If,
hoivjver, he should make up his mind
to return before I am ready to leave for
this port again, you will before long have
a chance to see him in San Francisco."
John Coffey was made chairman of the
jinks and presided until 11 o'clock, when
he was succeeded by Lew Morrison of the
Alcazar. Dr. H. G. Sieberst opened the
evening's entertainment with imitations of
musical instruments with a tin whistle;
Louis Butler gave four different ways of
reciting "A Little Peach Grew in the
Orchard"; J. Eagan of San Diego enter
tained with ventriloquism, and A. Hamp
hill told funny- stories, after which Col
onel Howell, past exalted ruler, or. be
half of the lodge, said many compliment
ary words concerning the work done in
the past by James P. Dunne, and then
presented him a fine gold watch chain
and emblem of the order, in gratification
of his recovery' from a recent severe at
tack of illness.
This wae followed by the exhibition of
stereopttcon views, Including those of the
heroes of the war with Spain. They were
loudly a.pplauded, but nooe so much so as
that of Dewey.

talent from the local theaters, and for
more than two hours there was interest
ing and entertaining amusement for all.
During the evening a collation and re
freshments were served.

Julius Noisat Gets Six Months for
Failure to Provide.
Julius Noisat, a big, burly blacksmith,
was sent to the County Jail for six
months yesterday on the charge of fail
ure to provide for his children.

as they were in rags. Noisat had been
living with a woman named Mrs. Mary
Smith at 301 Montgomery avenue while
his wife and children were starving.
Judge Conlan in sentencing the defend
ant said it was one of the worst cases
that had come before him. He regretted
that the law did not allow him to send
Noisat to San Quentln.

nated:
On Market street from the ferries to Valencia

RACE ON THIS COAST
MIDGET CYCLING CHAMPION
ANNOUNCED AS COMING.
Will Form One of a Party of Fifty
Men Who Will Ride in Me
chanics' Pavilion.
The indoor cycling tournament which
was hinted at in the cycling columns of
this paper some ti..' o months since Is at
length to become a reality. The first two
weeks in November have been selected
as the time for holding the tournament,
an : Mechanic - Pavilion the place. The
eight-lap board track which was used
during the indoor meet of 18% will be
slightly remodeled and again placed in
position.
The preserc- of the best of Eastern
talent is assured, as the American Racing
and Cycling Association, under whose
management the tournament will be held,
possesses cast-iron contracts -with Jimmy
Michael, â¢'Major" Taylor, Eddie McDuf
fee. Tom Linton. Ed Taylore, Charles
Church. Frank oiarbuck. 1\ J. Titus and
other riders, aggregating nearly fifty in
number. Jay Eaton will also be among
the talent. His riding while in this city
last year made him a favorite. Theso
men will be acompanied by their own
trainers ana will come West in special
cars.
The men while here will be under the
direct managemtnt of Samuel T. Mott,
though Aif Ellinghouse. the theatrical
manager, will have charge of the tourna-
A question of jurisdiction is likely to
arise when it comes to arranging for
amateur races to be run in conjunction
with the professional races, as proposed.
The Easterners are all under contract to
the management and care naugh: for
League of American Wheelmen or other
controi. Whether or not the California
Associated Cycling Club officials will
agree to allow their amateur? to race at
the pavilion Is a matter to be settled at
the next meeting of the association. No
great trouble is anticipated, howev?r. us
San Francisco H .as for so long suffered
from a dearth of cycle racing that it is
more than likely that reasonable con
cessions will be made in this case.
The season of short and middle dis
tance racing wil be concluded by a six
day race, in which Rice and Miller, tha
Eastern long distance champions, will
take part.
Rossi Exonerated.
Joseph Rossi, charged with causing thÂ«
death of the infant son of Philip An
nuzzi, was exonerated by a Coroner's
jury yesterday. Rossi had a quarrel with.
Ann lit two weeks ago and struck at
bin v.-ith a heavy stick. The blow fell on
the child's head and it expired Wednes
day It was supposed that the child had
died from the effects of the blow, but the
inquest shoved that the death was caused
by pneumonia.

POINT ARENA'S
MURDER MYSTERY
No Clue to Mrs. Morse's
Poisoner.
TWO PERSONS SUSPECTED
LACK OF EVIDENCE PREVENTS
THEIR ARREST.
Sons of the Aged Victim Using
Every Means to Trace the Mur
derer, but Their Efforts
Seem Hopeless.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
POINT ARENA, Aug. 20.â Although
three weeks have passed since the foul
murder of Mrs. E. P. Morse no trace
of the assasin has been found. The
vine-covered cottage where the horri
ble crime was committed is deserted
save for the birds that appear each
morning expecting to be fed by the
kind-hearted woman whose life was
crushed out by some unknown fiend.
Two persons are under suspicion, but
for lack of evidence It is not likely
that their arrest will be made. The
sons of the dead woman have employed
one of Morse's meu to ferret out the
perpetrator of the awful crime, but
thus far he. has been unable to obtain
a clew which would lead to the de
tection oi the criminaf. One thing is
certain, Mrs. Morse's death was not a
result of accident. The detective has
satisfied himself of this and is looking
around striving against hope for suffi
cient evidence upon which to make an
arrest.
When the unfortunate woman died
it was first thought her death was due
to ptomaine poisoning. Analysis of the
mush which she had eaten, however,
disclosed that it contained a sufficient
amount of arsenic to have killed a
dozen peoplf. It is now certain that
some one entered the house unob
served and secretly placed the deadly
poison In a bag of oatmeal which was
in the pantry. Mrs. Morse and her
son Le Grand partook of it in the form
of mush, the former dying about live
hours after. Her son still lives, al
though he had a narrow escape from
sharing the fate of his mother.
Mrs Morse was 80 years ot age and
was not known to have an enemy.
Thursday evening before her death one
of her sons, who conducts the general
merchandise store here, took home
the oatmeal, which was afterward
sprinkled with arsenic. It was placed
in the pantry along with other provis
ions. The following morning Mrs.
Morse prepared some mush, which was
partaken of by her and her son Le
Grand and no evil effects were felt
after eating it. Shortly after dark that
evening the aged victim went to the
house of her daughter-in-law, Mrs.
Downs who lives only a short distance
away Under the same roof lives Mrs.
Spaulding, also a relative by marriage.
Mrs Spaulding Is considered peculiar
by the residents of the town, pre
sumably on account of her inordinate
appetite for morphine. It is claimed
she is a clave to the drug, daily using
about five grains of it.
At first suspicion was directed to Mrs.
Spaulding, and many favored having
her arrested. Le Grand Morse, how
ever, refused to believe that the woman
had a hand In the tragedy, and vigor
ously resisted any attempt of her ac
cusers to have her thrown into prison.
When Mrs. Morse entered her daugh
ter-in-law's house she was met by Mrs.
Spaulding, who pleasantly saluted her.
Mrs. Morse asked her why she had not
called on her. The woman replied that
she had been busy, and cutting short
the conversation went upstairs to her
room. She did not appear again until
Mrs. Morse had left. It is argued by
several residents, who wink knowingly
when asked about the crime, that if
Mrs. Spaulding was the perpetrator of
the diabolical crime that she had ample
time to go to Mrs. Morse's house, place
the arsenic in the sack-*Qf oatmeal and
then return to her own home.
The detective who is working on the
case scouts the theory that Mrs.
Spaulding is the guilty party. He has
had several interviews with her and is
thoroughly satisfied of her innocence.
Although advanced in years, Mrs.
Spaulding still shows traces of beauty.
She is seldom seen on the street and
speaks only when spoken to. She has
been a slave to morphine for a number
of years.
"While I dislike to think that she had
a hand in the awful death of my poor
mother," remarked Lewis Morse to
day, "yet there is a vague suspicion in
my mind that she might know some
thing about it. My brother was very
kind to her, having provided for her for
j some time. However, I have not lost
i all hope, and earnestly pray that the
I real criminal will some day be brought
j to account for the awful crime."
Mrs. Spaulding has a daughter living
In E! Paso, Texas. She was formerly
the wife of Le Grand Morse, but he was
compelled to get a divorce from her.
i Her movements are being closely
I watched.
There is still another person at whom
! the finger of suspicion is pointed. He
struts the streets of Point Arena, su
premely indifferent to the venemous
whisperings of the residents. He knows
he is suspected, but for all this he has
I made no attempt to clear himself of the
stigma cast upon him.
Every effort is being made to find out
j whore the poison was bought. It is
: nothing unusual In this town to see a
I person enter a drug store and purchase
] a quantity of arsenic. No physician's
prescription is necessary, but the sale
; and name of the person buying it are
i recorded in a book. The record of the
I only drug store here has been thor
oughly exploited without gaining a clew
to the murderer.
Notwithstanding the efforts of the
sons and those of the authorities it is
strongly believed that the murder of
Mrs. Morse will be added to the bloody
record of unexplained mysteries of this
State unless the assassin voluntarily
gives himself up to the police.

General Ston : Reports That PeopleJbf

Special Table to The Call and the New York

PONCE, Porto Rico, Aupr. 26.â General
Stone, who has just returned from the
vicinity of Areclbo, reports that a state
of anarchy exists in the country districts.
The withdrawal of Spanish troops give
the guerrillas free play. Last night a
force of irregulars sacked and burned a
large plantation near Adjuintas. General
Stone says that the people are terror
ized, and are praying for American pro
tection. The Spanish formerly covered
the country with a mounted patrol. Our
forces have not yet been put in charge.
The natives and the Spaniards are busy
cutting each other's throats. General
Stone sent a full report to General Miles
to-night.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Aug. 26.â The
Supreme Lodge, Knights of Pythias,
adjourned to-day's session at 7 o'clock
this evening, after having elected the
following officers: Supreme chancellor,
Thomas Grample, Allegheny, Pa.; su
preme vice-chancellor, Ogden H. Fetti
ers, Wisconsin. The other officers will
be elected to-morrow. The men elected
were on the slate of the present admin
istration.
Much of the morning session of the
Supreme Lodge was devoted to the
consideration of the report of John A.
Hinsey, supreme organizer of the En
dowment Rank, on the condition of that
organization.
Representative Shively moved that
the report be printed. Friends of the
official household objected to this step
and the debate waxed warm. Repre
sentatives Ritchie. Riddle and a num
ber of others supported Mr. Shively's
motion and it finally prevailed, after
about two hours had been spent in dis
cussion. Mr. Hinsey said afterwards
that he was willing to have the report
printed.
Vague rumors were floating about
among the supreme representatives as
to the condition of the Endowment
Rank. This is the insurance branch of
the order, and has 53,575 members, car
rying insurance amounting to $99,261,500.
The statement of the board of control
shows the resources to be $523,276 62. It
is charged that $91,798 16 is entangled
in the affairs of a defunct National
Bank of Fort Worth, Texas, and noth

not Be Granted.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 26.â Senator Per
kina*has appealed to the supervising

Cowardly Assault on a
Sausalito Street.
RETRACTION WAS DEMANDED
SHOWEB OF BLOWS FOLLOWED
A REFUSAL.
F. W. Birlem, the Victim, Not Half
the Size of the Burly Ex-
Marshal, Who coasts
of the Feat.
Special Dispntch to The Call.
SAUSALITO, Aug. 2Câ Ex- Marshal
John E. Creed made a cowardly and
unprovoked assault upon F. W. Bir
lem, correspondent of a morning daily,
to-day, on account of the fact that he
had been mentioned in a newspaper ar
ticle as having been doorkeeper while a
faro game, which has now discon
tinued, waa in operation.
Creed and Birlem met on the street
and the former walked up to the cor
respondent, who is only about half as
large as the burly ex-Marshal, with an
oath, saying:
"I want you to publish a denial of
your statement that I kept door for the
faro gamesters."
Birlem replied that it was true and
he would not retract the statement,
whereupon Creed struck his smaller
opponent twice. Birlem was at last
forced to a promise to retract. Creed
then swaggered about the town and
boasted of his great deed, saying he
would teach reporters to keep his name
out of the papers, no matter what he
did. That he really kept the door is a
matter easily proved.
Creed seems to be continually spoil
ing for a fight with men not physically
his equal, but has the reputation of
being an arrant coward at heart, and
was once forced to "take water," in the
language of the street, by William
Harrison, the poolroom broker, in a
manner that earned him the contempt
of every citizen not a member of. his
"gang." Now that the poolroom trouble
is over and Creed has no opportunity
as Marshal to beat drunken men at
picnics, he is continually on the lookout
to show his prowess.
INCENDIARY FIRE AND A FIGHT

decide, whether Alameda or Los Angeles
/'shall- hold possession of the State R;-pub

â¢place to-morrow night at the Macdonough
Theater, The arrangements for opening
'. the State campaign in this city which
â  were commenced at Sacrajnento yestÂ«r
â  day, were perfected this morning at a
meeting at which many prominent Re
. publicans were present.
â â¢ There is a touch of sentiment as well
.. as patriotism in the coming campaign,
â â¢ bo far as Alameda and Los Angeles coun
.. ties are concerned. Ten years ago the
â¢ 'late Senator Denlson presented to Los
: ; Angeles a 'beautiful silk banner which
w.aS'to be the property, after each State
..election, of the county giving the great
est Republican majority. In 1596, as the
whole country knows, Alameda gave Mc
â¢Krriley 527S of a majority, aaid on No
. yginber 5 the Senator received a dispatch
: statins that a delegation from Los An- j
geles with the banner was on Its way to i
. Oakland. The banner was carried through j
â¢ '. the streets of this city on the Saturday
evening- following the election, and it has
. since remained here. There Is in addi
tion to a Republican sentiment, also a
â¢ (sentiment that out of respect for the
etalwart Republican donor, who Is missed
from the present campaign, Alameda
County should show that It is able to
e.upply the gap in the Republican ranks
' and to do what Senator Denison would
have it do. The fact that Henry T. Gage
comes from the county that is alone like
ly to give Alameda any trouble adds ad
ditional interest to the situation.
To-morrow night's demonstration will
be.held at the Macdonaugh Theater, and

â¢In reply to the Invitation to be present
Henry T. Gage sent the following mes- '
â¢sage:
"Alnmeda County has as loyal a band
of Republicans as there Is In the State,
and It will be a great pleasure for me
to' meet with them. I shall always re
: member Alameda County's generosity,
: . and also her earnest workers, who dis
â  carded personal ends for the sake of the
party. "
â¢Dr. George C. Pardee, whose recent
nations have gained for him the r
and admiration of the whole State, will be
chairman of the great meeting. William
R". .Davis, who recently contested at the
primaries with Dr. Pardee, will also
make a speech. Victor Metcalf, Repub
lican nominee for Congress, will speak.
as will also Senator Georgre C. Perkins
â  and possibly General W. H. L. Barnes,
Jacob Neff, candidate for Lieutenant
Governor, and Major Frank McLaughlln,
chairman of the State Central Commit
tee.- â 
The demonstration will undoubtedly be
one of the most important and signifi
cant political events that have ever
â  taken place in Alameda County.
The distinguished gentleman who heads
the- Republican ticket will be met at the
â  .train by a reception committee headed
by Mayor Thomas, Hon. W. E. Dargte,
r>'r D "D. Crowley and Arthur H. Breed.
They will escort Mr. Gage to the Mac
donough Theater, where he will be In
troduced to the audience by his late
rival. Dr. George C. Pardee.
It was decided to-night to have a big
street march to-morrow night, prior to
' the demonstration at the Macdonouprh
â¢ Theater. Henry T. Gage will be met at
â¢ the train at Seventh and Broadway at
730 by a big procession. The Young Men's
â¢Republican League, the Republican Ward
' clubs, the Pardee Club, the Pondlnkles
' and hosts of Republicans will be In line,
to follow the carriage in which will ride
Dr. George C. Pardee and the Republican

CTHIKESE IN POLITICS.
A Club Formed to Control the Vote
'.â¢â¢â¢ . of Chinatown.
' The few Chinese in this city who are
entitled to votes have banded themselves
together into a political club with the ob
ject of controlling: the Chinese vote.
' .A meeting was held In a hall in Stock
' ton street last night- with fifty members
present. The club is at present without
â¢ regular officers, â  a temporary president,
â¢secretary and treasurer having bcÂ«n elect
ed-, and it Is expected that at the next
meeting regular officers 'will be chosen.
â¢. â¢ Sing Lee, a Chinese merchant, also known
as William Lee. is the moving spirit 01 the
â¢ club and aspires to the office. of president..
The .'members are well posted on local and
â¢ -State politics, and the club will probably
: 'control the whole Chinatown vote at the
. next election. _
. Garfleld Republican League.
The' Garfleld Republican League met
last night at Myrtle Hall, President E. M.
Galvin in the chair and Judge Bachelder
acting as secretary. It was decided to
affiliate with the Anti-Civil Service State
League, and a resolution was passed re-
L-retting the evasion of the question by
the Republican State Convention in tne
adoption of its platform.
It was decided to invite the candidates
on the State ticket to address the ratifi
cation meeting 'Â»f the league on September
1. A committee was appointed to arrange
for an outing and excursion of the league,
to be held next month and to secure
special rates therefor and provide new
features for the entertainment of guests.
The drill corps was fully organized for
active work, and under Captain Galvin
will take part in the campaign turn-outs.
Hon. Z. U. Dodge was indorsed for the
Republican nomination for the Senate in
the Twenty-second Senatorial District.
McLAUGHLIN
WILL BE THE
CHAIRMAN
To Guide the New
State Committee.
OPENING OF THE CAMPAIGN
RALLY OF THE YOUNG MEN'S
REPUBLICAN CLUB.
Judge Maguire Will Name Seth
Mann as Chairman of the
Democratic Central
I
Committee.
Now that both the Democratic and Re
publican State Conventions have com
pleted their work, the political managers
of both parties are beginning to arrange
the details of the coming campaign. Con
ditions are such that the campaign will
probably be one of the liveliest In the
history of the State, and it is certain
that from now until the eve of election
the State will ring with oratory of the
kind that Is presumed to carry convic
tion to the hearts of voters and terror
to the souls of political opponents. Spell
binders of high and low degree are oiling
their voices for the coming fray, and
the song of the candidate is heard in the
land.
It is partly because of the hurrican*
nature of the brief campaign that is now
at hand that more than ordinary inter
est attaches to the personnel of the gov
erning bodies of the two parties, as it
is understood that it will rest with the
State Central Committees to make a suc
cess or failure of the work of the next
two months.
Among Republicans there is the utmost
satisfaction over the announcement that
Major Frank McLuughhn will again be
at the head of the State Committee. The
work he has accomplished during tne
past two years in cementing any differ
ences that may have existed in the par
ty, as well as in directing the organiza
tion of the Republican lorces througn
out the State, nus been invaluable and
will lend no inconsiderable weight to the
measure of the party's success at the
polls.
Major McLaughlin had planned to
make an extended visit to Japan with his
family as soon as the new State Central
Committee was organized, but he is not
to be permitted to resign las steward
ship. .Party leaders have joined in re
questing him to remain at the head of
the State governing body tor another
term, it being urged that for him to re
sign the helm to a less experienced hand
at this time might jeopardize the success
of the party. 'iKese counsels, it is assert
ed, have prevailed, and the Japan trip
has been indefinitely postponed.
The exact dale fur the organization of
the new Republican State Central Com
mittee has not yet been definitely fixed ,
but it will probaoly occur some time dur
ing the coming week. Henry j .
the Republican candidate for Governor,
will name the members of the Executive
Committee cf the State Committee prior
to ins return to his home In Los Angelea
âprobably Monday or Tuesday. The fetate
Committee will then be caned together
and organization will be effected, in the
meantime Major McLauglilm is actively
engaged In mapping out the plan for the
campaign whicn will begin at once.
The reception that is to be tendered to
Mr. Gage in Oakland to-nignt is not
looked upon as the opening of the cam
paign, b.ut rather as a reunion of the
lorces of the men who were opposed to
each other in the contest for the nomina
tion for Governor. It will be a grand
good tellowship meeting at which all will
join hands and piedge their support to the
common cause, it will be on a scale
proportionate to the occasion and will be
traced with the presence of Dr. George
C. Fardee, United States Senator Perkins,
William R. Davis, Frank F. Davis, Vic
tor H. Metcalf and many other notables.
The campaign will be opened in this city
on Monday evening by a grand rally of
the Young Men's itepubliean Club at 1212
Polk street. C. W. Kyle and J. H. Rob
erts are announced as the orators of the
evening.
Nothing definite has been fixed upon re
garding the itinerary of Mr. Gages trip
irom this city to his home in Los Angeles.
Nothing more is known at present than
that he will probably go direct to the
Southern metropolis without a stop. Ar
rangements are now being made for a
monster demonstration to celebrate his
home-coming.
On the Democratic side of the political
fence there seems to be the same lack
of enthusiasm that marked the proceed
ings of the Democratic State convention.
Judge Maeuire has not yet named the
members of his executive committee, ajj^d
it is not probable that he will do so be
fore his return from Los Angeles, where
he is now in attendance at the Stale con
vention of the Silver Republican branch
of the Populist-Democratic party. Seth
Mann will be the chairman oi the State
Central Â«'<<mmittee, and will have charge,
under the direction of James Gailaghc-r,
chief of the Clan Gallagher, of Maguire's
campaign. It is given out that Maguire
Will stump the State In the interests of
himsr-if and the Populists, Silvc-r Bepub
licans and Democrats, whose names ap
pear on the fusion ticket. This announce
ment has given rise to much speculation
as to the manner in which he wii* pre
sent the claims of Walter Van Dyke,
for instance, the fusion candidate- for
Justice fpf the Supreme Court, Who
has been a Republican all his
life, and who has from year to
year added to political history by giving
vent to his belief in th^ unworth of all
Democrats, washed and unwashed alike.
It is said that "Whispering" Gavin Mc-
Nab has demanded that he bo allowed to
name a majority of the executive com
mittee of thp new Democratic State Cen
tral Committee. The demand, which was
made Immediately aftf-r the adjournment
of the Democratic State convention, was
mentally pigeon-holed by Judge Maguire.
The Influence that the whispering bops
has exercised In local and State politics
is not of the kind that conforms to Ma
guire's Ideas of party harmony, and as
a consequence McNab Is not to be allowod
to jeopardize the chances of thp Demo
cratic candidate for Governor by bring
permittr-d to influence Xhr- acts of the
State Commute. It Is predicted that Mc-
Nab will find more difficulty in breaking
through the hpdgo of Gallaghers than he
did in "reforming" local politics.

TWEHTY-OHE
MEN TO DIRECT
THE CAMPAIGN
Nominee H. T. Gage
to Select Them.
ACTIVE WORKERS DEMANDED
SCENE OF POLITICAL ACTIVITY
TRANSFEKRED HERE.
Major J. H. Simpson Enters the
Race for the Congressional Nom
ination in the Fourth.
District.
The scenes of political activity have
been transferred from Sacramento to
San Francisco. At headquarters of the
Republican State Central Committee in i
the Paiace Hotel a large throng of active i
and confident Republicans yesterday as- j
sembled and discussed the events and in- |
cidents of the State convention. Henry j
T. Gage, the standard-bearer of the Re- j
publican party, was there. He was in
frequent consultation with advisers and
trusted lieutenants, but found time to j
turn aside and acknowledge at intervals
the congratulations of many who called
to see him and wish him success in the
campaign now about to begin.
By decree of the Republican State con
vention the duty devolves upon Mr. Gage, j
as the nominee for Governor, to appoint |
an executive committee from the State j
at large within fifteen days from the date |
of the adjournment of the convention. As j
the convention adjourned sine die A.v- j
gust 25 the appointments must be made I
on or before the 9th of SeptemberâAd
mission day. The officers of the executive
committee are to be ex-oflicio members j
of the Slate Committee.
Mr. Gage will not leave here for his !
home in J^os Angeles until the middle or |
latter part of next week, and no doubt i
by the time that he Is ready to start i
for the suuth a majority of the twenty- !
one will be selected. Many of the con- I
ferences aside at headquarters yester- j
day had reference to such selection.
Much interest was manifested yesterday :
in the great demonstration planned to i
take place in Oakland this evening. To i
attend this important assembly of Kepub-
Means many of the delegates from Los
Angeles, San Diego and other counties ;
have decided to postpone departure for i
their respective homes until Monday.
Before the regular formal opening of
the campaign there will be a meeting of I
the new State Central Committee in this
City. This meeting will take place shortly |
after Mr. Gage announces the names of i
the twenty-one members to compose the j
executive 'committee. The announcement j
of the executive committee may not be â¢
made before September 9, but in the
meantime names will be canvassed and
agreed upon. The convention did not
stipulate that the executive committee of
'twenty-one should consist of three from
each of the seven Congressional districts,
but did direct that the nominee should
appoint from the State at. large. It is
probable therefore that half the com- !
mittee will residents of San Francico. so
that a working force may be instantly
available at any time during the progress â 
of the campaign.
Republicans expect that progressive
and broad-minded men will be chosen by
Mr. Gage. There is a sentiment in favor j
of an infusion of young material in the ;
committee, even to the exclusion of orna- i
mental "has beens." j
Major Frank MoLaugrhlln, chairman of
the State Central Committee, is soing to !
Santa Cruz to rest for two or three days. â 
He expects to return to San Francisco on j
Tuesday next. Before leaving, however, j
he gave an order for 50,00) campaign but- j
tons. In the last campaign the tirst or
der for buttons called for only 10.000, but :
the demand for them was so great that ;
I'oO.OoO were ordered before the contest '
closed. Indications are that the Gage !
button will be in great demand. A large ;
number of lithographs were also or- j
dered.
Among the callers at State Committee
headquarters yesterday were Thomas !
Carothers of Mendocino. H. Z. Osborne |
and FranK F. Davis of Los Angr-les, U. S. .
Grant and E. S. Babcock of Han Diego, !
Frank Leavitt and William Friend or
Oakland and many well-known Republi
cans of the city.
The Congressional nominations In the
Fourth ami Fifth districts are talked j
about by the politicians. The story goes
that Julius Kahn will have no walkover
for the nomination in the Fourth. An
other candidate, In the person of Major J.
H Simpson, is In the field. The rank of i
major is just the right grade for the com- |
mon people. It is not too low for the ;
aristocrats and not too high for the push.
Simpson won his rank In The Union army
at tne front during the War of the Rebel
lion It is true that he is a lieutenant col
onel' on the staff of Sol Cahen. department 1
commander of the Grand Army of the Rp- \
public, but the position is only temporary, ;
and after Cahen retires Simpson will re
cede to the rank of major. A good hustler
and a -good talker is Major Simpson, and i
his friends hay- confidence !n his I
ability to win out in tne Democratic
stronghold against Jim P,.-irry.
There Is some speculation concerning
Republican candidates for Equalizer In
the- First District. A. Chesobrough states
that he does not desire to serve another i
term on the State Board of Equalization, i
John Lochmann. George Dlxon and Edgar j
Hrlggs are mentioned as candidate. The j
Democrats nominated John P. Dunn.
It is said that James Cymes of San
Mateo can pet the Republican nomination
for l:ailroad Commissioner in the Second
District, composeu of the counties of San
Francisco Pan Mateo and Marin. W. M.
Hinton is the Democratic nominee.

POPULISTS CAUSE A
POLITICAL MUDDLE
Factional Fights Deter the Work of
Four State Conventions at
Boise, Idaho.
BOTSE, Idaho. Aug. 20.â Very little
progress was made to-day by the four
State conventions in session here. The
two wings of the Populists did not. unite.
The other parties refuse to have Â«ny
thins to flo with them unless they do
aether. They have given the war
riiK factions until 8 o'clock to-morrow
to~et together. The Democratic conven
tion adopted a platform. It favors free
coinage, reduction of tariff, condemns the
issue of bonds, and favors the election of
Senators by direct vote. On questions
crowing out of tho Spanish war It says:
"We declare our unfaltering allegiance
to the Monroe doctrine and arc strenu
ously opposed to the annexation of Cuba,
believing the inhabitants of that Island
should be given the opportunity of self
government. We also advocate the reten
tion of all territory acquired by American
valor and war waged for humanity, al

yield their consent.

GATHEHING OF
SILVERITES AT
LOS ANGELES
Convention to Open
This Morning.
MAGUIRE WILL BE INDORSED
ALSO OTHER CANDIDATES ON
THE FUSION TICKET.
Many Aspirants for the Temporary
Chairmanship, and a Hot Time
Is Looked For Among
the Contestants.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 26.â Delegates
to the Silver Republican State Conven
tion have been arriving by every in
coming train to-day, and the headquar
ters of the party at the Nadeau Hotel
have been filled by representatives of
the party from all sections of the State.
It is expected that about 600 delegates
will be in attendance at the convention,
which will meet at the Music Hall to
morrow morning. The convention will
be called to order by Judge J. N. Phil
lips, chairman of the State Central
Committee.
There are a number of aspirants for
the temporary chairmanship of the
convention, and a hot time is expected
to occur among the numerous contest
ants, principal among whom are Dr.
Dlxon of Sacramento. J. H. Woolman
of San Diego, T. H. Wells of Santa
Monica, R. H. Dague of Ventura and
H. A. Ingalls of Oakland.
According to present plans the con
vention will first adopt a platform and
then take up the real business of tha
convention, which will be to nominate
James G. Maguire for Governor and E.
L. Hutchlnson for Lleutenant-Qoverr
or, and from present Indications all of
the other delegates already named by
the Democrats and Populists will be In
dorsed without any opposition, so that
the convention will really amount v a
ratifying convention, ratifying the can
didates of the Democratic and Populist
parties.
H. A. McCraney, candidate for Clerk
of the Supreme Court, is announced to
address the convention, and several
others are booked to make bow-legged
speeches, setting forth the superiority
of the "hog dollar" over that of the
solid money of the country.
THEY MAY NOMINATE
AN ENTIRE TICKET
HARNEYITES WAITING FOR
STATE COMMITTEE TO ACT.
Tortuous Times Are in Store for
Mayor Phelan â Ellert Is Again
in the Ring.
Local politics and politicians are In a
state of lassitude Just now. The big guns
ol the State have left the boards too re
cently for the smaller fry to attract any
attention, but In a few days, when the
results of the two great conventions at
Sacramento have been thoroughly di
gested, municipal affairs will come to the
fore. Aspirants for office are content to
cherish their ambitions in secret, and as
yet have, with gratifyingly few excep
tions, refrained from thrusting their trou
bles upon the public.
â \Yhat the situation will be a month
from now nobody dares to guess. There
may be two tickets, not counting the
Populists and other freaks, or there may
be four, it all depends upon what course
the Harney branch of the Democracy and
the Non-Partisana may decide to pursue.
Ever since the turning down of the Har
tley delegation to the State Democratic
convention there has been considerable
talk of that faction putting up a straight
municipal and legislative ticket in this
city, but this has not definitely been de
cided upon, not will it be until the State
Central Committee organizes and shows
what it intends to do in the way of or
dering primaries for the municipal con
vention. It it aoes that, the Harneyites
are likely to remain quiet and take their
chancel In capturing their share of the
delegates, for there nas oeen some quiet
but effectual work done already with that
object !n view. Oiubs are being formed
throughout the city by the Harneyites,
and tne claim is confidently made that
if it comes to a primary they will not get
the worst oÂ£ it.
On ttie other hand, if an attempt Is
made to turn the municipal convention
over to the Committee of One Hundred,
as was done with the State delegation,
the Harneyites will call for primaries of
their own, elect delegates and put up a
straight ticket throughout.
The Non-Partisans, too, are undecided
what course to purÃue. While some
favor the nomination of an Independent
municipal ticket, others, including I>. K.
Kllert, oppose this, and think it bettor to
wait until the Republicans and Democrats
nominate their tickets and then Indorse
candidates on both. If the former course
Is pursued and the Harneyites put up
their ticket there will be a pretty four
cornered tight waged here for a month
before election.
Mr. Ellert may have an ulterior motive
in advising this plan, for it Is no secret
that he would not decline the Republican
Mayoralty nomination, and should he se
cure it. naturally he would turn to the
body over which George K. Fitch presides
for its indorsement.
About the only name that has been men
tioned so far as against Mr. Ellert is that
of F W. Dohrmann, who. It is stated,
would not object to succeeding Phelan.
The present Mayor, by the way, is des
tined to find some hard .going between
now and November S. Witn the Harney
ites In control of the Democratic Conven
tion â tvs they would almost certainly bo
were the delegates elected by primariesâ
the Mayor would stand abcr-t the same
cha.net; for the nomination as Uatan does
of securing absolution, Vni!f> if the State
Central Committee turns the control of
affairs over to his cotTte of one hundred
again there is the Inevitable split and in
dependent nomination, leaving Phelan the
choice of one faction and a lot of dis
gruntled Democrats anxious to do him
Kirat political injury. Mayor Ph< hm
is not going lo drift into the office again
on the tide. So say the prophets.
The Non-Partisans have added to their
committees and instructed the members
to thoroughly canvass for available ma
terial for municipal offices In ordor to
make Independent nominations if they de
cide upon that plan instead of Indorsing
other nominees.

UNITED EFFORT
TO OVERTHROW
THE REA GANG
Boss Rule Doomed in
Santa Clara.
ALL DECENT FORCES COMBINE
WILL PBESENT AN INVINCIBLE
COUNTY TICKET.
An Amalgamation Effected Which
May Result in the Complete
Annihilation of the
Bingsters.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Aug. 26.â There will be a
hot political" battle in Santa Clara
County this fall, and a complete
annihilation of the Rea forces is pre- i
dieted. The participants will be the |
"gang" on one Bide and the opposing
side will consist of the amalgamated
forces of the Democrats, Silver Repub
licans, Populists and Good Government
League.
Preliminary steps looking to a union
of the latter four parties hay.i already
been taken, and but a few minor de
tails remain to be arranged. This is the
expressed wish of a majority of the
voters of the county, and such a ticket
seems certain of success.
Already the Reaites see In this their
Waterloo and they are trying to smooth
things over. The boss' promises have
been given and broken too often, and
there is no chance of the chasm be
tween good government and corrupt
politics being bridged.
The Democrats have suffered through
Rea's Interference in their party. Their
leaders and the boss are at logger
heads, and at the meeting of their
County Committee yesterday he came
in for a good "roasting." The other
elements and better class of voters will j
have nothing to do with the gang, and
solid ranks of voters are arrayed
against the Republican county ticket
named by Rea's convention.
While the Republicans opposed to
Rea will work hard for the State ticket
from Gage down, they are determined
that Rea shall no longer run county
affairs.
The Democratic county convention is
called for Friday, September 2. The j
Populists meet on the same date. Both |
these parties will appoint conference I
committees and confer with similar j
committees from the Silver Republicans
and Good Government League about
the naming of an amalgamated ticket.
The division of the offices has been
agreed upon, and there will be but two
or three skirmishes for places on the
ticket. _ _
The Populists will insist upon F. B.
Brown for District Attorney, J. L. Rid
dle for Justice of the Peace and the
naming of two Assemblymen from this
county.
The Silver Republicans want the
' Senatorial nominee in the Thirtieth
! District, and Dr. Fowler of Santa Clara
is mentioned for the place.
A. S. Klttredge for Superior Judge,
E. W. Conant Treasurer and J. H.
Lyndon for Sheriff have been allotted
the Good Government League as their
share of the county ticket, as it is pre
! sumed this organization will support
the regular Republican legislative
ticket.
This leaves the Democrats one As
semblyman and the following offices,
which will probably be filled as fol
lows: County Assessor, L. A. Spltzer;
Tax Collector, W. A. January; County
Clerk, H. A. Pfister; Coroner, Dr. F.
M Mahon; Surveyor, P. C. Sainsevain;
Recorder, Al VeuvÂ«; Auditor, E. C.
Farley; Superintendent of Schools, L.
J. Chlpman.
The other township offices and Su
pervisors have not been agreed upon,
but W. S. Whitehurst will most likely
be nominated for Supervisor in the
Fourth District and M. Casey of Gil
roy in the First District.
About the only hitches in agreeing
upon this ticket will be over the offices
of Sheriff and Superior Judge. The
Democrats want V. A. Scheller for
Judge and George Bollinger for Sheriff.
Bolllnser is Rea's man find the gang
propose to "knife" Langford, the Re
publican nominee, for him. The Popu
lists, Good Government people and Sil
ver Republicans refuse to accept Schel
ler and Bollinger and avIH insist upon
Lyndon for Sheriff and Kittredge for
Judge. These same parties will also
insist upon the Democrats naming
Pfister for County Clerk, Spitzer for
Assessor and January for Tax
Collector. This last trio are all Demo
cratic incumbents and have provod
efficient officials. The Democrats will
put up Chipman (anti-gan.ar Republi
can) for Superintendent of Schools.
This ticket if nominated will be the
strongest ever placed before the vot
ers of Santa Clara County, and Its elec
tion Is certain. Rea Republicans are
even conceding this last fact.
The total vote of Santa Clara County
is between 12.000 and 13.000. The Demo
crats and Republicans are about equal
ly divided and have a party strength
o"f about 4500 each. The other 4000
voters are divided among the Popu
lists Good Government League, Sil
ver 'Republican*. Prohibitionists and
Independents. The Populists claim a
strength of 2000, Good Government
Leaerue 1600 and Stiver Republicans
700 This makes a total of 4300 votes.
This number, with two-thirds of the
Democratic votesâ 3oooâ will be more
than sufficient to elect the ticket. Mem
bers of the forces opposing Rea are
snmjuine of success, and at this time
the indications point to a victory for
the respectable classes and a complete
overthrow of the Rea gang at the No-
vember election.
FISTICUFFS AT STOCKTON.
Political Scuffle Between a Justice
and an Editor.
STOCKTON. Aug. 26.â Irving Martin,
editor of the Record, who was elected '
State committeeman for Stockton, had an ,
encounter to-day, in the presence of ,
Mayor Inglls and other officials, with :
Justice C. P. Rendon. Rendon's political
standing went down at the late primaries?,
when solid Republicans turned out and
smashed a slate which had been pre
pared.
In the convention the Justice was de
nied a renomination. The Record was
against his faction and he has not been
on good terms with Martin since. Ho
I went to the Sacramento convention as a
! spectator, and returning home before
j Martin, circulated a report that the cdi
i tor had attempted to interrogate Hon.
Frank Ryan, the Congressional nominee,
concerning his religious proclivities. Mar
tin was angry at this attempt to inject
! prejudicial and factional questions into
the party, and locating the Justice in
i the courthouse to-day denounced him
! roundly, even to passing the lie. The
i Justice resented this, and Just as the mlx
i up came the officials interfered. The af-
I fair is the talk of the day.
Martin claims ho will obtain a personal
letter from Ryan denying he ever made â¢
I such interrogations. [

LOOKING FOR ANOTHER PATCH
BEADY TO STRADDLE THE SIL
VER PLATFORM.
Declines to Discuss Issues, Reserving
Himself for Opening of His
Campaign in This City
Uext Week.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 26.â This after
noon's Southern Pacific train brought
to Los AngeJes James G. Maguire and
the most variegated lot of politicians,
perhaps, ever carried on one train. Ac
companying the straddler of three dis
tinct party platforms was William H.
Alford. chairman of the Democratic
State Central Committee. In the same
car were a number of Oakland dele
gates to the Silver Republican State
Convention, which convenes here to
morrow morning, and in addition to
U-ase was a noticeable sprinkling of re
turning delegates from the Republican
State Convention, who conspicuously
displayed yellow badges bearing the
name of Henry T. Gage, Republican
nominee for Governor of California.
The little giant of several issues was
met at Burbank by a joint committee
of Democrats, Populists and Silver Re
publicans, consisting of Senator
Stephen M. White, E. L. Hutchinson.
Judge Winder, Judge J. L. Murphy,
Judge J. N. Phillips, W. R. Burke. Dr.
R. W. Hill, J. B. Dockweiler, Earl Rog
ers, John T. Gaffey, Nathan Cole Jr.,
and others.
Upon the arrival of the train at Bur
bank the committee entered the car oc
cupied by Maguire and were cordially
greeted by him. Being asked to give
his views on the present campaign, he
politely declined, adding that he would
reserve such an exposition for his open
ing speech of the campaign, to be made
in San Francisco next week.
When the train arrived at Los An
geles it was met by other members of
the reception committee who had been
left behind, and a brass band especially
instructed to play "See, the Conquering:
Hero Comes." The spotted hero then
entered an onen carriage, and, accom
panied by Senator White, Judge Phil
lips and Chairman Alford, was driven
to the Nadeau Hotel, where the band
had been stationed, -'aving inspiriting
airs.
At the hotel the Congressman was
greeted by a large number of delegates
to the Silver Republican Convention,
and a steady stream of these advocates
of the "hog dollar" passed through to
his apartments.
Among the plans made for the enter
tainment of Congressman Maguire dur
ing his stay in this city was a reception
given this evening in his honor at the
headquarters of the Silver Republican
Club, where members of all three par
ties met to greet their candidate and
partake of refreshments.
The programme for to-morrow even
ing consists of a reception at Hazard's
Pavilion, at which it is expected the
glad hand will be extended to all, ir
respective of party. The reception is
to be under the joint supervision of
committees for each of the throe parties
by whom Maguire has been and is to
be further nominated.
As it is a foregone conclusion that
Maguire will be nominated by the Sil
ver Republicans to-morrow afternoon
he will no doubt be required to make a
speech, and his acceptance of the con
ditions of the Silver Republican plat
form will be carefully noted by all par
ties interested in the result of the cam
paign.

JOE LANKTREE'S
EXPLANATION
Denies That Alameda Is
Disioyal to Pardee.
COMBINATION WAS NEEDED
i
NO ONE ATTEMPTED TO SELL
OUT xO HENRY T. GAGE.
Indignant Alamedans Offered to Tar
and Feather the Guilty Man
if He Could Be
Found.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Aug. 26.
The Alameda delegation from Sacra
mento is now at home and again follow
ing its usual vocation. There Is a de
sire on the part of all to avoid any ref
erence to anything that might break the
harmony now existing in the party.
Joe B. L&nktree of Alameda, who has
been freely mentioned in connectionn with
a 6ecret deal with Lou Brown regarding
the delegation from the Forty-sixth As
sembly District, declares that there was
nothing done that was disloyal to Dr.
Pardee or his interests.
"It was well known," said Lanktrea
to-day, "that Brown had many friends in
this district, and it was only by a union
of the Brown and Pardee forces that suc
cess could be assured for a ticket that
would beat that of W. R. Davis at tha
primaries. There is nothing in those let
ters from Lou Brown that needs explana
tion. We were for Pardee first and Lou
Brown second. We went to Sacramento
loyal to Dr. Pardee, and the fact that
some of us did not wear Tils badges pos
sessed no significance. We renewed our
pledges to Dr. Pardee at Sacramento and
he expressed himself as satisfied With the
contiition of affairs.
"A story was circulated that one pi tno
delegation from the Forty-sixth went to
Mr Gage and offered to deliver part or
the delegates. When the story reached us
we immediately went to Dr. Pardee and
offered to muster our fourteen delegates
before Mr. Gage and have him pick out
the one who had made any such propo
sition. We further agreed to tar and
feather any one guilty ol such treach
erous conduct. Dr. Pardee, however, said
he did not believe the story, Mr GagÂ©
denied it, and we renewed our pledges ot
loyalty to Dr. Pardee." .
The delegates returned, not with draped
colors, but with them flying for Henry T.
Gage Assemblyman Frank Leavitt, one
of the most earnest workers for Dr. Par
dee, declares that the defeat of his favor
ite will have no effect on the loyal Re
publicans of the county and predicts that
Alameda will retain its title of the banner
C0 '"rhere Is nothing that can be said
against the ticket," said Dr. Pardee to
day "while there is everything to be said
in commendation of it. It is a first
class ticket all through and I fervently
hope that it will be elected. Of course
Alameda County is disappointed over not
being placed on the ticket, but that would
have no effect upon the general outcome,
for it is the party, not personal aspira
tions that we must work for. I have
nothing but thanks to my many friends
for the kindness and devotion to my inter
ests, but I am not selfish enough to be
lieve that it was for me alone that they
worked so gallantly. It was for Alameda
County as well, and I know that the same
feeling will prompt the boys to give a
great majority for the ticket. I am con
vinced that with the election of Henry T.
Gage California will have an able man
at the helm for the next four years.'
PAY ING JOB
The Mayor Finally Signs the Dis
puted Contract.
Mayor Phelan yesterday signed thÂ«
contract awarding to the City Street Im
provement Company the job of repay
ing and repairing bltuminized streets for
$37,978. He stated to a Call reporter that
he had arranged with J. W. McDonald,'
representing the company, that where
repaying work specified under the con
tract was not needed that other work
should be substituted.
"Mr. McDonald has agreed to It," re
marked the Mayor, "and so I have ap
proved the award, although the specifi
cations are loosely drawn."
The Mayor has apparently grown
weary of his contest with the Board of
Supervisors, where a two-thirds major
ity can be drummed up to carry a mo
tion over his veto, as was recently shown
in the gaslight contract job.
This Week's Wasp.
An excellent likeness of Henry T. Gage, who
received the nomination of the Republican party
for Governor by acclamation, is presented with
every copy of this week's issue of the Wasp.
The cartoonists have had fruitful subjects for
brush and pencil in the Populo-Democratio
candidate for gubernatorial honors, who Is so
hard up for campaign material that he has
been forced to evolve a bogey out of his vain
Imaginings, and in the way in which the
Tiemooratlc nomination for the Fourth Con
gressional District fell to that party's chief
buffoon, who received the McNab's leavings
as any Cuspidor shmiM. Strong and thoughtful
editorials on the political situation merit thÂ«
careful perusal of every one interested In tha
coming campaign, and rx-SenÃtor Mulrooney's
letter is sharp and pointed. Random sketches
slve a clever pen and ink history of thÂ»
humorous side of the week's happenings, and
other illustrations comprise views of Manila,
a capital picture of the delegates to the Head
Camp of the Woodmen of the World, now in
session In San Francisco, and fine portraits of
acturs and actresses who are soon to make
their appearance on the stages of local theaters.
The number is both readable and Interesting
from every point of view.

AN ACCOUNTING DUE.
pijOÃ days the Examiner advertised a pyrotechnic
shew and solicited patronage for it on the
â * ground that a portion of the proceeds were to
be devoted to the Maine monument.
Just here a digression is necessary. Ever since the
battleship was blown up in the harbor of Havana
Hearst has been trying to raise funds for the erection
of a monument, ostensibly in memory of the brave
men who perished there, but really to the honor and
glory of the justly celebrated brand of Hearst pa
triotism. There is reason to believe that if the money
be procured the shaft will contain in large letters the
name of Hearst, professional lover of his country,
while in smaller script, in some less conspicuous lo
cation, will be a casual allusion to the Maine. In his
efforts to collect money Hearst has offered to pay
solicitors 10 per cent of such sums as they may col-
lect. This circumstance came to notice without any
connivance on the part of the yellow journalist, and
the publicity of it was no part of his plan. It threw a
great light upon his scheme and divested it of the
aspect of sweet unselfishness with which it had been
equipped. Then, for a while, the plan rested, and a
comforting belief that Hearst had become ashamed of
himself ensued.
That this hope was founded on a misconception of
the character of the man became evident when his
paper began to boost the pyrotechnic display on the
ground that a portion of the profits were to go to the
monument fund. The display has taken place. The
public has a right to an accounting. What were the
profits? What proportion of them went to the monu
ment? These are questions wholly proper, and we
would pause for reply save that we have other busi
ness. However, at any time a reply shall be forth
coming we will be glad to publish it. If there were
profits either the monument must have a share or
the public has been cheated again. If there were no
profits the value of the Examiner as an advertising
medium is not impressive. If there were profits how
great and where applied?
WHO IS THE KANSAS HOODOO?
PERHAPS there is nothing strange in the fact
that the soldiers who volunteered for service
and got nothing but sentry duty and scant
army rations should feel disgruntled. Existence at
Camp Merritt was not a round of pleasure, and even
at the Presidio there were things to be desired. But
the Kansas regiment has had the unhappiest time. In
the first place its Governor permitted it to leave the
State ill clad and destitute of every means of comfort.
Upon its arrival here the men were observed to be
ragged, shoeless and unkempt, and because of this
they were taken to the public heart. The Red Cross
women did all that was possible for them and the
Kansans were duly grateful.
At first the regiment was without a colonel, a lieu
tenant colonel being in command, and he quickly
demonstrated that he was totally unfit for the re
sponsibility. When the real colonel reached the camp
he brought order out of confusion, drilled the men
into line, got decent equipment, and soon had a regi
ment that any officer might be proud to command.
The revolution he wrought made the subordinate sick.
He went to the hospital, was almost dismissed from
the service for incompetency and has never since
seemed to have a joyous moment. There has been
trouble in the ranks. Some minor official got away
with commissary stores and was publicly disgraced.
Now he accuses his superiors of being culpable with
him. The lieutenant colonel left the hospital, nursed
his grievances and began to stir up strife. He is
threatened with arrest. There seems to be a hoodoo
on the Kansas boys.
The fault is not with the regiment, not with the
colonel. It rests farther back. It can easily be traced
to the Governor. Leedy is a Populist. He brought
fo his high position all the crankisms, which constitute
a greater plague to Kansas than the grasshoppers ever
did. He tried to live up to all the fool notions of his
erred, and his career has in consequence been one
long mistake. In all of this there is a lesson for Cali
fornia. The Democrats are trying to foist a Populist
Governor upon California. This State wants no
Leedy, nor Pennoyer. nor Waite. It has seen re
sults enough. There is no occasion for it to try ex
periments. We can learn from the Kansas hoodoo
without putting a hoodoo of our own into the execu
tive chair.
General Shafter is accused by the Examiner of com
mending his own work. In the matter of self-lauda
tion there are few persons or institutions able to give
the Examiner points. The difference between Shaf
ter's position and that of his daily tra-ducer is that he
can say a good word concerning the work of the army
he commanded and be believed.
Jim Rea may still cherish the idea that he is a politi
cal boss, but observers can discern with half an eye
that an "ex" has been placed before his title.
Unfortunately for several aspiring gentlemen there
is a comparatively poor demand for second-hand
badges
THE REPUBLICAN PLATFORM.
THE fusion press expresses great disappointment
because the Republican platform doesn't suit it.
There must be a mistake somewhere. The fu
sionists really act as though the Republican party was
under bonds to please them in its platform and ticket.
The delegates differed with the fusionists in this re
spect and made a Republican platform and ticket.
They also complain that the platform is too long,
but it is shorter than the pinto platform on which
Judge Maguire stands, for that is in three sections
like a freight train that is too heavy for one engine to
pull.
The Republican document has through all its length
a warm thrill of patriotism and cheer and hope, of
confidence in American institutions and promise that
they will be perpetuated. The American soldier and
sailor, warworn and scorched under the vertical sun
of the tropics, will feel his homesickness vanish when
he reads in it recognition of his sacrifice and a record
of his bravery. In many an American home, where
the sun has not shone as brightly since the blithe boy
marched jocund to the war, old hearts will throb
gratefully in harmony with the utterances of this plat
form in behalf of the men who went forth to fight
and of the homes they left behind them.
The platform stands up for the principles of the
party, for the rights of man, for sound money and
sound men.
It embodies the well-known demands of The Call,
that Asiatic coolies be barred from Hawaii, and that
our labor laws and their eight-hour day be extended
to the islands.
The Democrats have a representative on the Ha
waiian Commission. Why did not their platform in
struct him in the public sentiment of this State on that
subject?
The protection of labor, the maintenance of wages,
the public policy that will give work to the wage
earner, are the subjects of first consideration in this
phtform.
It points the way to a larger irrigation policy and
to conservation of the means thereto by preservation
of the forests. This one declaration is of the highest
value, and all people interested in forestry, and that
means every citizen of the State, should agitate this
subject throughout the campaign, and by electing a
Republican Legislature make sure an earnest effort to
prevent forest arson and punish the incendiaries who
are responsible for it.
The whole platform will come safely through the
fire of criticism, and is in itself a campaign textbook,
and when expounded on the stump will be found like
the armor of our warships, invulnerable to the guns of
the enemy.
& BOOM FOR ROOSEVELT.
THE Presidential boom launched at Chicago a few
days ago tor Colonel Theodore Roosevelt is
very far from being a campaign joke. It would
not be at all surprising if the hero of El Caney were
elected Governor ot New York this fall, notwithstand
ing the opposition of the machine element in the Re
publican party of that State, and if he is so elected it
is not unlikely that he will fall into the Presidential
line upon the retirement of Mr. McKinley.
Besides, the Roosevelt boom has been launched
under excellent auspices. The Chicago Republicans
who have become members of the "Roosevelt Club"
are the same men who discovered Harrison and Mc-
Kinley. Indeed, the Union League of Chicago,
of which they are all leaders, has long been the storm
center of Western Presidential booms. That organi
zation is quick to discover the political strength and
availability of public men and equally as speedy to
make known its sentiments. The resolutions of the
"Roosevelt Club" indicate that these boomers have
uncovered the source of the famous New Yorker's
political availability and at the same time that they
understand the condition of the public mind on
Presidential questions. The resolutions state that the
club has been formed "for the purpose of making
effective in Republican politics the independent,
courageous and patriotic spirit shown in the political
and military career of Theodore Roosevelt."
Of course, no one anticipates that the Republicans
will set President McKinley aside in iooo. Two years
hence he will sweep the country, even if at that time
he shall have completed his war work. The issues
he will then represent will be too strong to be over
come; but in 1904 the case must necessarily be differ
ent. The war will then be mostly forgotten. After
eight years' service President McKinley will be sur
feited with honors, tired and probably glad to retire.
In addition the third term rule will be invoked against
him. No President has ever yet attempted to violate
this rule, except General Grant, and he failed utterly
to achieve his ambition.
In 1904, therefore, Roosevelt will be a man upon
whom the Republicans may with great propriety unite
for victory. But we regard the attempt that is now
being made to run him for Governor of New York
as a political mistake. He should be allowed to rest
on his laurels for two or three years. He has earned
glory enough to last him that length of time. If the
Republicans of the Empire State know their business
they will spring him on the people about 1000. If
then elected Governor he could give the State an elec
trical government for a couple of years, and no power
on earth could prevent his nomination for President
in 1004.
However, the "Roosevelt Club" can do no harm in
the meantime. It is always well to keep such men as
the rough riding colonel before the public. Their ex
ample is one of the glories of a free and independent
country.
For reporters to remember that Mrs. Botkin is
merely accused of a crime, not convicted, would add
to the value of their printed observations. Chief Lees
has evidently made up his mind as to the prisoner's
guilt, and there is no reasonable supposition that any
evidence can shake it, or that evidence tending to cast
doubt upon his conclusions will be encouraged to ap
pear. A reporter, however, would win just as much
glory by demonstrating the woman's innocence as her
guilt, and makes a mistake in looking into the subject
from the standpoint of the sleuth whose business is to
convict people. The detective who forms his theory
first and afterward shapes the evidence to fit it is
prone to err. While circumstances so far as developed
are certainly against Mrs. Botkin, the case is too
grave to admit of hasty judgment.
In view of his bolting tendency shown on many oc
casions, would it not be wise for the Democrats to
appoint a committee to keep Maguire in the party
until after election. It would be very confusing to
have the candidate jump the fence in the midst of the
campaign.
It is rumored that Senator Braunhart is in favor of
a primary if it will use his justly celebrated isinglass
ticket, with which he formerly purified politics up to
the clarified standard of the present Supervisors and
School Directors.
It is pleasing to note that Dewey's fleet is to be re
enforced: also that it is not to be re-enforced. The
dual announcement gives people of diverse opinion
the right to feel pleased.
THE SAN FKA'JM CISCO CALL, SATURDAY, AUGUST 27, 1898.
SECRETARY HflY AND HIS TfiSK-
RARELY has the selection of any man for the
office of Secretary of State been received with
a warmer or more universal approval than that
of Colonel John Hay, now Embassador at the Court
of St. James. In the Eastern press the nomination
has been most cordially commended, there being
hardly so much as a partisan opposition, and even in
Great Britain there is evident a widespread satisfac
tion at the choice.
It is safe to say that for the greater part of this
commendation Colonel Hay is indebted more to what
he has accomplished in literature than in statecraft.
The American people are always favorably inclined
toward those who have distinguished themselves in
the domain of letters, and not infrequently have con
doned mistakes made by literary men serving as Min
isters abroad which would have been severely de
nounced had they been committed by Ministers se
lected solely for eminence in politics.
Colonel Hay, however, has had much experience in
diplomacy, and, while his accomplishments in that
field have not been so widely known as those he has
achieved as an author, they are nevertheless of a
nature sufficiently important to justify the sanguine
expectations that are held of his coming career as
Secretary of State. He was for four years a private
secretary of President Lincoln, was afterward Secre
tary of the American legation at Paris and at Madrid,
and has now held with credit to himself the important
post of Embassador to Great Britain. These years of
diplomatic experience have given him training for the
work that lies before him, and fully justifies the Presi
dent in selecting him for the place.
The very universality of the approval with which
the appointment has been greeted, however, will ren
der it difficult for the new Secretary of State to main
tain the high prestige he now holds. Where every
one expects so much some are sure to be disappoint
ed. Colonel Hay will be confronted at the outset by
the complex problems of foreign policy arising out of
the war with Spain, and it goes without saying that
whatever course he pursues he will run contrary to a
large body of public opinion. t
The nation is at a fork of the road. It is jo be
determined whether we are to preserve our sepaijation
from European conflicts or join Europe in the igame
of land-grabbing in the Orient. The one way is a
continuance in the sure paths of peace. The ottoer is
to enter into the conflicts of the world, where *from
the very conditions of things we must necessarily be
brought into antagonism with at least some oif the
great powers with whom we are now on friendly
terms.
British approval of the appointment of Colonel Hay
to the office of Secretary of State is due to a belief in
London that he will be favorable to something like
an alliance between Great Britain and the United
States for the protection of their commercial interests.
That belief is a delusion, for of course Congress would
never consent to such an alliance. The British, there
fore, are sure to be disappointed to some extent, and
possibly a good many people in this country will be
equally so when the new Secretary gets fairly to work.
There is all the more reason therefore why the great
mass of conservative citizens who understand the
difficulties in the way of the administration should be
considerate and loyal in supporting both the Presi
dent and his Secretary in conducting the nation safe
through the crisis that confronts it.
BY the death of Ernest Narjot California loses
not merely her oldest painter, but one of those
who have done most to direct the culture of this
city toward artistic achievement and to develop on the
Pacific Coast an art characteristic of its earth and
sky and peculiar to its cosmopolitan life. A notable
leader in an important field of activity has gone from
us, and the loss will be keeiwy felt in many circles.
California owes much to every class of the pioneers.
Among the early settlers there were representatives
of almost every variety of talent. A considerable
number of these, moreover, were of sufficient force to
be genuine leaders of men and of sufficient originality
to lead the rising community toward new fields of ac
complishment. There was something of creative
power within them, and they were able to make out of
the material around them a civilization quite distinct
from that to be found anywhere else on the globe.
It is to the impulses given by these strong and
original men in the ranks of the pioneers that we owe
the rich and attractive character of our social system
and the mighty achievements of our industry. It is
no slight thing that a community so young as Califor
nia should have attained the leadership of so many
progressive communities as those that make up the
United States in the many fields in which such leader
ship is now universally recognized as ours. The im
pulses that have carried us so far and to such
heights in so short a time could have come only from
men animated by something of a prime elemental
force in human nature, and we can never give them
more honor than is justly their due.
It is so often stated that the early settlers of Cali
fornia were mere adventurers seeking for gold that
something of emphasis should be given to the thou
sand evidences that refute the charge. Among the
pioneers and in the host of the argonauts there were
many who sought wealth simply for the power it
would give them to perform great things. Some of
them did not attain the wealth and did the great
things without it. They built up a mighty State, es
tablished a wonderfully diversified industry and fused
a cosmopolitan population into a community out of
which there is rapidly developing a culture that prom
ises to be unique in the history of the world.
Ernest Narjot was one of these directing men who
have helped to make us what we are. Through the
influence of his life and work and those of his brother
artists of the earlier years San Francisco, though the
youngest of the larger cities of the Union, has already
attained an artistic culture second to none. More
over, most of our painting is distinctively Californian
in spirit and form, as well as in name. This city now
appears clearly destined to become one of the great
art centers of the world, having a school and a motive
of its own, and for that promise we are much indebted
to the old artist whose paintings have inspired us in
the past and will long remain among the precious
possessions of our galleries.
Hungry soldiers on their way to Santiago to relieve
the soldiers now there cannot be blamed for having
raided fruit stands as they passed along the streets of
New York. They had had nothing to eat for twelve
hours, and the War Department has no right to treat
troops this way in a time of peace and a land of
plenty.
Mr. Phelan regrets that the Republican platform
does not suit him in regard to the new charter for
San Francisco. We beg to assure his Honor that the
new charter will be ratified by a Republican Legis
lature, and that it will be put in operation by a Re
publican Mayor.
Judge Maguire heard that the office would be seek
ing the man in Los Angeles, and hurried down there
to be found.
ERNEST NARJOT.
A CHALLENGE TO JAMES G. .MAGUIRE.
Mr. J. G. Maguire, Populist nominee for Governor, asserts that singl<
tax is not an issue in this campaign, yet there is reason to believe that
said Maguire is willfully deceiving the public in this regard. He forced
Cassin for permanent chairman upon the Democratic convention. He had
Cassin appoint Seth Mann, of Maguire's law office, as chairman of the
committee on platform and also put Joseph Leggett thereon. These Ma
guireites made the platform demand a constitutional amendment allow
ing local option to counties as to what may be taxed. We all know that
there has been no demand on the part of the public for any such amend
ment and that the only sentiment back of said demand was that of the
single taxers. It is just to infer that, therefore, Maguire is seeking to
obtain the coveted tax by the usual Maguire methods of indirection. It
is therefore pertinent for the land owners to understand what single tax
really is. It is not truly a system of taxation, but a system of confisca
tion. It is the appropriation of the full (economic) rent of land by the
State by the method of taxation. This was advocated years before George
by a society in England, but they could make no headway, because, being
honest men, they advocated that compensation should be made to the
owners of land for the capital represented by said rental value. Then
later un sprang the newspaper reporter, George, and his followers, like Ma
guire, and declared that a little thing like compensation would not stop
them, but that they must establish the coveted system without compensa
tion, as compensation would involve too many bonds, etc. The writer
hereof heard said Maguire advocate said appropriation by the State with
out any compensation being made. This is not legislation, nor taxation â
it is sheer confiscation. To this central fact I desire attention drawn. I
here and now challenge Judge Maguire to deny that he advocates the ap
propriation of the full economic rental value of land by the State from the
present owners (and through the indirection of taxation) without any com
pensation being made by the State to the owners of said land who have in
vested their capital therein. Any one can perceive that this would render
land wholly unsalable and, in a short time, cause all land to revert to the
State; that it would depreciate the value of real estate mortgages fully 60
per cent; would ruin the savings banks and building and loan societies
and bring the thousands of savings bank depositors to ruin. It would make
the future negotiation of loans on land, improved or unimproved, impos
sible, cause a rise in the rate of interest, give a shock to public and priv
ate credit, from which the State would not recover in years; defame the
fair name of the State in the eyes of the world; and last, but not least,
would damn the Democratic party beyond hope of resurrection for the next
generation. Believe me, Mr. Editor, very respectfully,
JOHN HEENAN, Attorney at Law.

THE SERVICES

INTERRUPTED.
' last week the youngster was highly In
terested In every number on the pro
gramme, but the most vivid impression he
received was the singing of the song,
"Come up and get your moneys worth,"
which was sung by a coon who performed
all sorts of gyrations with his cavernous
mouth. The next day the little fellow
amused his proud parents by giving an
' almost exact imitation of the colored sing
! er, even to the manipulation of the lips
i and the effect was irresistibly funny.
Now the aforesaid prominent citizen is
| a regular church attendant as well as a
i theater goer, and last Sunday he accom
i panied his wife and the lad to a house of
worship. As is customary with the father
he gave fifty cents to his boy to put in
the contribution plate. The latter ap
peared to be unusually devout during the
services that morning and imagine the
consternation depicted on the faces of his
parents and the amused countenances of
the rest of the congregation v^hen they
i heard the youngster say as he dropped
the half dollar in the plate, which was
presented to him by the deacon. "Come up
and get your moneys worth."

STREETCAR FAREâ Subscriber. City.
If a passenger bets on board of a street
car and tenders in payment of fare a
$10 pieco and the conductor has not the
change the general rule is for the con
ductor to carry the passenger as far as
the turning-in office of the company,
where he can obtain change, unless he
can sooner obtain it from some of the
other passengers. It has been held that
a conductor must have enough change to
"break" a reasonable tender, but that he
is not bound to carry enough change to
break a $10 or $20 piece. A conductor
would not be justified in ejecting a pas
senger who made a tender of a $10 pieco
for a 5 cent fare and was willing to re
main in the car and be taken to the com
pany's office, but if the passenger insisted
upon having his change right away or
demanded nis money returned to him and,
created a disturbance the conductor
would be justified in stopping ti-e car and
putting him off.

SHOPLIFTERS IN COURT.
The cases of Tillie Pels and Ella Shear
â¢ er.the two young women arrested in the
â  Emporium last Saturday evening for
shoplifting, were heard by Judge Mo
â¢ gan yesterday afternoon. Attorney Long
appeared ac special prosecutor, and the
â¢ defendants were represented by counsel.
â . The evidence for the prosecution was
clear. The Feis girl then took the stand
â¢and threw the whole blame upon her
companion. Ella was so indignant that
she asked permission of the Judge to re
: tire until Miss Pels' examination was
.over, and when she took the stand she
accepted her share of the blame, but de
clared that Miss Ffis was as guilty as
herself, if not more so.

A CLEVER PLAYWRIGHT.
Mrs. Romualdo Pacheco, Whose Theatrical
Compositions Have Achieved Success.
Mrs. Romualdo Pacheco, a lady who has achieved a marked degree
of success In plays composed by her. arrived in town on Thursday and
has taken apartments at the Occidental. Mrs. Pacheco needs no intro
duction to the people of California, for her home has been here for
many years, and she is well known for her strong intellectuality and
grai iou.s manner. She has come here to supervise tho production of her
latest play, "The Leading Man," which will serve to open the Bush
Street Theater, rechristened i!;> i "Comedy," on Friday, September 2. She
a capable and Intelligent company of players, which she
hopes to make a permanency for the interpretation of plays of her own
composition.
â¢' "The Leading Man.' " said Mrs. Pachtco. "is my latest comedy, and
â was written originally for Mr. Nat Goodwin, with whom I had a signed
contract. He had an curlier contract, however, with Madeleine Lucette
Ryley, and as the play written by her was an emphatic success he re
linquished his claim on mine. I rather regretted the occurrence, as I
should have liked Mr. Goodwin to interpret the principal role, for I con
sider him one of the foremost comedians. The play is a society corned y
ln four acts, the scene being laid in two country bouses in Westchester
County. The hero is an actor at a swell theater and^lt is a part that
requires great powers. This I have intrusted to Mr. Brigham Royce. an
actor unknown to these parts, but fully capable of rendering justice to
the character. My leading lady will be Misa Carina Jordan, who, in ad
dition to being :m intelligent actress, is a playwright as well, having
had a play accepted by Richard Mansfield.
"Many of my Eastern friends Questioned the wisdom of bringing my
company to San Francisco for initial productions, but I am so nearly
related to California by home ties that I resolved to let her set either her
seal of approval or disapproval on my humble efforts, feeling confident
that I will receive Justice at her hands.
"As to the manner of writing plays. I hnve no particular system. I
start with a central idea and the rest comes without any apparent ef
fort. I wrote the first act of 'The leading Man' in two hours, and
having read it to my husband he said that if the other acts should prove
as good as the first the play would be a success. I earnestly hope it
will."
The other plays which will be given by the Pacheco company will be
"Woman's Wit," "American Assurance," which is the old play "Nothing
But Money" improved, and which had a large measure of success some
years ago. Mrs. Pacheco also intends to purchase the rights of another
one of her plays, "Incog," now held by Charles Dickson, and that will
be added to the repertoire of her company.
RING FATALITY
BARELY AVERTED

THE KNOCKDOWN WAS HEARD
ED LYNCH'S SKULL. NEARLY
FRACTURED BY A FALL.
Gus Koster Vanquishes the Former
in Short Order â Throe-Round
Bouts That Proved In
teresting.
Ous Koster of the San Francisco Ath
letic Club still retains the title of ama
teur champion middle-weight of the Pa
cific Coast. Ed Lynch of the California
Athletic and Swimming Club essayed to
deprive him of that honor last night be
fore the members and friends of the
Manhattan Athletic Club, with nearly
dire results to himself and to boxing in
this city.
A love tap administered by Gus' dex
terous left sent him on his back, and as
his head struck the poorly padded floor
the impart could be heard all over the
gymnasium. Lynch' fl chances of winning
were slightly dimmed by the left swing,
but the bump he received in falling sent
him to dreamland. Sergeant Blank then
jumped Into the ring and stopped hos
tilities.
The fight was short and crisp. Roth
men entered the ring strengthening their
vulnerable points by chewing gum. Ref
eree Conroy admonished them in the |
proper manner, and as tfce gong sound- !
ed both men spat out their gum and !
the sport began. Lynch rushed and land- !
ed a light tup, and Koster sent him to
the floor with a left Jolt. Lynch arose
and sparred a while and then led again. ;
This time Koster was ready for him and '
landed a left hook on the jaw. Lynch I
was dazed by the blow, and mechanically i
raised his hands, when Koster swung
again. The glove landed on the chin. !
and the California Club's pride went to
the door with a bang. The vanquished
pugilist showed marvelous grit. Tho
bump on the head would have settled â 
nine out of ten men, but Lynch stag
gered to his feet dazed and beaten.
The police sprang forward at t.hia mo- i
merit, fearing that he had sustained I
grievous injuries. Koster was either mer
ciless or "rattled," for he tried to finish i
his rival with another left. Had his arm |
not been arrested by Sergeant Blank an- I
other ring ffitallty would have been re- '
corded, as Lynch was past the point of i
defending himself.
Even when the latter a seconds led him
to his seat to revive him he was closely
inspected by Lieutenant Price and his as- I
sistants.
The Call has always advocated padding
in the ring, well knowing its attendant
dangers. All clubs have heeded the sug
gestion, but many have only lightly I
padded their arenas. A little more felt I

under the Manhattan's canvas would not
be at all expensive.
Chief Lees' attention has repeatedly
drawn to the lack of padding in the
arenas of these mushroom clubs, but it
would Beem that he has paid little heed
to the warning. As has already been said
in these columns, he will awake some
morning and learn of the death of some
youngster through his negligence in not
instructing his officers to examine the
condition of the ring. Two inches of
boiler-felt padding is sufficient to prevent
a fatality, and it is hoped that the cnief
of Police will see that it is provided in the
future.

AGAINST CALIFORNIA FRUITS.
j. a. Filcher, manager of the California
State Board of Trade, has forwarded to
Secretary of State Day a long communi
cation which includes a resolution recent
ly passed by the board with reference
to the action of the Swiss Federal Coun
cil. According to the information the
latter body passed a decree prohibiting
the importation into that country of all
unpeeled American fruits. The resolution
states that the Swiss tariff on imports
of canned and dried fruits and vegetables
ia prohibitory and made solely in the in
terests of a single Swiss cannery that
now imports its fruits from France, Ger
many and Italy. Such embargoes placed
(in American canned and dried fruits are
particularly inimical to the interests of
California." As the Swiss Government is
now seeking to conclude a reciprocity
treaty with the United States the board
wets forth ite position and requests In
the following resolution:
Resolved, That the California State Hoard of
Trade asks ul the State Department at Wash
ington, D. C, such prompt and energetic action
as may be deemed requisite and necessary, to
the end that the evils herein mentioned may be
corrected and that adequate privilege may be
furnished the dried or cured fruit and the
canned fruit and vegetable Industries of Cali
fornia and of the United States.
The resolution ia accompanied by a long
scientific article which clearly shows that
nearly all of the fruit pests that have
annoyed the California growers have been
destroyed, and that the Swiss Govern
ment has no cause for fear, because the
process of curing destroys all insect life
in the fruit
MERCHANTS
HAVE ENTERED
A PROTEST
Oppose the Slashing
of Freight Rates.
BY THE CANADIAN PACIFIC
SAY IT IS INIMICAL TO OUR
COMMERCIAL INTERESTS.
An Earnest Appeal for Relief Made
to Sir William Van Home,
President of the
Road.
Tha wholesale merchants of this city
have decided to take a hand in the freight
rate cutting controversy which is now
agitating the various transcontinental
lines.
The commercial bodies of San Francis
co, without wishing to take tildes in the
controversy, but simply to protect their
own interests, held a meeting in this city
the early part of this week and adopted
a series of resolutions which have been
forwarded to Sir William C. Van Home,
president of the Canadian Pacific Railway
Co., at Montreal, respectfully calling his
attention to how he is Jeopardizing the
values of the stocks of goods on the Pa
cific Coast and suggesting to him the ad
visability of adopting a system of rate
making that will relieve the situation of
the present precarious condition and
maintain transcontinental freight rates
on a firmer basis.
There were represented at the meeting
the following associations:
Wholesale Grocers' Association of Cali
fornia; Wholesale Dry Goods Traffic As
sociation; Wholesale I>rug Trade of Cali
fornia; Wholesale Paper Trade of the Pa
cific Coast; Paciiic Coast Hardware and
Metal Association.
Resolutions were adopted as follows:
Sir William C. Van Home, â President Cana
dian Pacific Railway Company, Montreal,
Canadaâ Dear Sir: At a meeting of the duly
authorized delegates from the principal Job
bing interests and associations of this city,
held on the ISth of this month, the following
resolution was unanimously passed:
â 'Whereas. The present system of rate-mak
ing on transcontinental shipments to Pan Fran
cisco enforced by the Canadian Pacific Hall
way is In our opinion prejudicial to the busi
ness Interests of San Fr.inci^co and the Pacific
Coast generally. Inasmuch a-s paid system occa

of goods in Jeopardy; and, whereas, the other

of the Canadian Pacific Railway, are main

"Resolved, That a committee consisting of
one from each and every jobbing lnter-st re
presented at this meeting b>; selected by the |
chairman to plve expression to these our views
to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company,
through Its president. Blr William C. %an
Borne, and to request that said company adopt j
a system of rate-making to San Francisco that â 
will relieve the situation of the present precar
ious conditions and maintain transcontinental
freight rates on a firm basis, believing th.it
â ticb an arrangement will redound to the best ;
Interests not only of the mercantile community j
of the Pacific Coast, but to the Canadian Pa- I
ciflc Railway aa well."
All of which 1b respectfully submitted, with
the request that you kindly acknowledge re- ,
celpt of this communication.
A. prominent business man who has tak- â¢
en a great Interest has this tv say on the i
subject, and he voices the sentiments of
many other merchants:
"The question of transcontinental ;
freight rates has bpen one that the mer
chants of the Pacific Coast have be<n !
considering very carefully ever since the
Milwaukee tariff was adopted June 21.
The attitude of the Canadian Pacific Hail
way Company has made the Importation
of large stocks of merchandise to the Pa- i
cific Coast an extra hazardous one, as the I
American roads could little longer brook
the rate cutting of the Canadian Pacltlc
Railway Co., and it was only a question
of time when a rate war would be de
clared that would be very disastrous, not
only to the railroad companies themselvi B,
but to the Pacific Coast patrons who have
large stocks of goods vn hand which
would be depreciated greatly in value by
a reduction in freight rates.
"The Pacific Coast merchants have con
sidered the attitude of the Canadian Pa
cific Railway Co. as unfair, not only to
American railroad Interests, but to the
mercantile community of the Pacific j
Coast, as It has placed in jeopardy the j
value of the entire stocks of gooda on
hand In the stores and warehouses on this j
coaft. . Â
"That the public may understand the ;
exact attitude of the Canadian Pacific in >
this matter by way of explanation I
would pay that the Canadian Pacific Rail
way Co. "have insisted on always making
a 10 p< r cr-nt lower rate than the Ameri
can mads, which they claim as a "differ
ential " and that the American roads !
have conceded that to them. These are |
not the facts. The American roads have i
not "conceded" anything. The CanadJ m
Pacific Railway Co. has arbitrarily in
sisted on maintaining- that differential.
"In other words, a foreign-built road,
subsidized by their Home Government,
that will make Rood any losses that might
be brought about by a rate war. is at
tempting to force American railroads to
carry American manufactured poods for
American merchants at a higher rate
than this foreign road is charging."

pose of making arrangements for the
holding of the State convention. After
an exchange of opinions by those present
it was decided to call the convention In
this city during the second week of Sep
tember," at which a full State ticket will
be nominated.

WILL BE SUBMITTED
TO ARBITRATION
FREIGHT BATE QUESTION TO
BE SETTLED AMICABLY.
One Member of the Committee to Be
Chosen by the Canadian Line,
a Second by .American
Roads.
Vice President Stubbs and Freight
Traffic Manager William Sproule of the
Southern Pacific Company returned last
night from Denver, where they have been
attending the meeting of the Transconti
nental Freight Association. As has
been anticipated, the officials at the con
ference decided to adjust the freight rate
difficulty in an amicable manner and to
the best interests of all concerned, and to
that end the officials concluded that the
best way to settle the question was to
submit it to a board of arbitration, which
will have full power to act in the prem
ises. The Canadian Pacific Railway,
which had M. M. Stern as spnki-sman,
will be allowed one representative on the
committee, the American roads will
choose one, and these two will pick out
a third man to arbitrate the matter.
"It was* a thoroughly harmonious meet
ing," said Mr. Stub'ns. "and it appeared
to be the sense of all the officials pres
ent to settle the trouble as soon as pos
sible, and arbitration was voted to be
tho best method of .solution. I do not
know who the members of the arbitra
tion committee will be. but undoubtedly
they will be men who are thoroughly fa
miliar with the question in all its details. !
Neither do I know on what basis the
settlement will be made, for that will
be a matter for the three gentlemen to
decide."
Inquiry In other railroad quarters fail
ed to develop any further information
in that connection. There was a re
port circulated that the two members of
the committee would be K. T. Jeffries,
president of the Denver and Rio Grande,
representing the American lines, and
Robert Kerr, traffic manager of tho Ca- j
nadian Pacific, for the lines west of Lake
Superior. The report could not be con
firmed, however. It was also said on
the street that if the arbitration com
mittee were to recommend that the dif- j
ferential of 10 per cent now enjoyed by
the foreign line were to be reduced to
3 per cent it would meet with the ap
proval of the American lines.
The question of passenger rates was
not touched upon at nil In the confm-
er.ro, notwithstanding the telegraphic re
ports to the contrary, and the subject
was left in abeyance.
Discounted Their Warrants.
Salary warrants of registration officers
to the number of 909 were distributed Fri
day, and as there was no money in the
general fund to pay th.-m more than 800
were sold to brokers at a discount of $2

THE ILLS OF WOMEN
And How Mrs. Pinkham Helps
Overcome Them.
Mrs. Mart B*>ixinger, 1101 Marianna
St., Chicago, 111., to Mrs. Pinkham:
"I have been troubled for the past
two years with falling of the womb,
leucorrhoea, pains over my body, sick
headaches, backache, nervousness and
weakness. I tried doctors and various
remedies without relief. After taking
two bottles of your Vegetable Com-
pound, the relief I obtained was truly
wonderful. I have now taken several
more bottles of your famous medicine,
and can say that I am entirely cured."
Mrs. He>ry Dorb, No. 606 Findley St.,
Cincinnati, Ohio, to Mrs. Pinkham:
"For a long time I suffered with
chronic inflammation of the womb,
pain in abdomen and bearing-down
feeling. Was very nervous at times, and
so weak I was hardly able to do any-
thing. Was subject to headaches, also
troubled with leucorrhoea. After doc-
toring for many months with different
physicians, and getting no relief, I had
given up all hope of being well
again when I read of the great good
Lydia B. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound was doing. I decided immedi-
ate^' to give it a trial. The result was
simply past belief. After taking four
bottles of Vegetable Compound and
using three packages of Sanative Wash
I can say I feel like a new woman I
deem it my duty to announce the fact
to my fellow sufferers that Lydia
E. Pinkham's Vegetable remedies have
entirely cured me of all my pains and
suffering. I have her alone to thank
for my recovery, for which I am grate-
ful. May heaven bless her for the
good work she is doing for our sex."

FLASHES FROM
THE
FOUR BASES.
The Athletics have been playing some
very good ball of late. In the two games
last week Fitzpatrick pitched the best
quality of ball, and Tils team backed nim
up In the most beautiful style. McLaugh
lin has now reached his plane and he is
sure to improve day by day. lie is one
of the best fielders in the league.
Owing to the derangement of the Infield
of the Santa Cruz team there was -\ gen
eral looseness about their play last Sun
day. The errors, which were frequent
enough to be annoying, would probably
not have occurred had the team remained
intact.
The Stocktons, as they will appear on
the diamond to-day, will be a very strong
team. An Infusion of new blood has been
injected in the team. Borchers and Knell
will do the twirling for them. Pace of the
Portland Club will catch and Patterson,
who was formerly with the Interstate
League, will play right field.
.The line-up for to-day's game is as fol
lows:
Oaklands. Position. Stocktons.
Moskiman Pitcher Borchers
Sullivan Catcher Pace
Bliss First base Selna
O'Neill Second ba5e......:... Smith
Lange Third base White
Schmeer Shortstop Billings
Dean Left fie1d. . ........ . Muller
Donovan Center field Rice
Hardie Right field Patterson
The standing of the clubs is as follows:
Won. Lost. Pet.
Sacramento 14 -6 '35
Athletics 14 7 .66ti
San Jose 13 9 .586
Kant a Cruz 12 10 .643
Oakland 11 11 .600
San Francisco 9 12 .42$
â Watsonville 6 15 .lia
Stockton 4 14 .222
San Jose has signed Pitcher Thomas of
the disbanded Fresno team. He is a '
lirst-ci;tss twirler, and with that team
behind him he should fill Lberg's place.
Manager Campbell was in town yester
day to protest against the \\ atsonvlile
team playing Thin! Baseman Courtney.
He claim? that Courtney r.ccepted his
terms by wire, so he sent him a railroad j
ticket to report at Stu<kten last Sunday,
but Courtney returned the ticket and |
went to Watsonville Instead. Mr. Camp- i
bell has all the necessary proofs regard-
Ing the deal, and Courtney will he com
pelled to play with Stockton if he expects
to play in the Pacific Coast League this
season.
According to the changes made by the
league at a recent meeting, the games to
be played at Santa Cruz and thl* i-ity
have been rescheduled. The Oaklands
and Stocktons will play their faurteen-tn
ning tie game oft", at Recreation Park to
day, and Oakland and San Francisco will
play their first game o" the revised
schedule in this city on Sunday.
AVatsonvllle will go to Santa Cruz in
stead of San Francisco.
Th games at San Jose and Sacramento
will be the same as the old schedule.
The league will meet at the Baldwin
Hotel en Monday evening, and will adopt
the revised schedule, which will provide
for each club to play the same number of
games against each other. All postponed I
and tie games will be counted in the new j
schedule.
. The schedule committee of the Califor- I
nia Amateur League held a meeting !
Thursday afternoon and arranged a i
schedule to be adopted at the league
meeting next Tuesday evening.
McCarty, late of San Joso. has been
billed to play with Watsonville on Sun
day.
â¢ The largest crowd of the season attend
ed the game at Stockton last Sunday, and
they were much pleased with the new
men of the team.
Manager Campbell says that about 100
of Stockton rooaers will come down with
the club Saturday morning to attend the
fame here and they will also go to San
use with the club.
â  Manager Bunker of San Francisco has
been on the alert this week. He has se
cured Iberg to pitch for his club and will
have the strongest team that they have
had this season in Sunday's game.
' The Daisies and Capaduras will meet on
the Eighteenth and Harrison Grounds to
morrow. The personnel of the Daisies is:
Drewes, pitcher; Hunter, catcher; Shu
macher, short stop; Walsh, first base;
William, second base; Gamble, third base;
Shannahan, left field; Cullan, right fleld;
.Maher, center field. Capadurasâ Karuza,
pitcher: Rogers, catcher; Harra, short
stop; Coleman, first base; Thompson, sec
ond base; Winters, third base; McCarthy,
left field: Bothe, right field, and Aitken,
center field.
The Alto Baseball Club will play the
Oletas next Sunday at 2 p. m., at the Cali
fornia League Grounds, Sixteenth and
Folsom streets. This will probably be the
last game of the Altos before playing in
the new amateur league, the garaea of
which will, no doubt, commence on Sep
tember 4. The Altos claim the amateur
championship of the city and hope to
make It the State In the coming tourna
ment.
The line-up Sunday will be:

DOUBLES TOURNAMENTS
FOR THE BAY CLUBS
The championship doubles at San Rafael
In the early part of the month will prob
ably draw a great crowd of 'tennis enthu
siasts and players. It was not decided
until recently that the tournament should
be held In San Rafael. The Del Monte
courts were favored by many, but now it
se^ms assured that San Rafael will be
the locality for the championshii games.
The three bay clubs will send In their
quotas in the latter part of next week.
This afternoon at the California Club
courts there will be a doubles tournanif-nt.
Every Saturday tournaments of an im
promptu order have been played, and the
interest manifested In them has been of
no mean quantity. George Whitney, Kil
garlff, Werner Stauf. Colonel Linderman,
Walter McGavin. Davis, Blanchard.
George Smith, Buchley, Harvey Walter
and Dr. Root have entered their names
for a doubles tournament to-day. The
pairing off in teams will not take place
until the tournament is called. These
tournaments are usually stake events.
The players make a pool and the winners
take the prize, whatever it amounts to.
A dinm-r and some social pleasantries
usually follow.
To-morrow there will be a doubles tour
nament at the Bellevue Tennis Club of
Alameda. The club's doubles teams will
enter and the tournament will be open to
Alameda City. Some line may bo had on
the possible representatives of the club
for the championship event at San Rafael
after this Alameda tournament is finished
During the week at the California Ten
nis Club, George Whitney and Dr. Root
beat Joe Daily and Harvey Walter. Score:
6â2, 6âB, 6â3.
Robert N. Whitney and Joe Daily played
an exciting match, in which each took a
Bet. George Whitney beat Dr. Root: Bâ fi.
Walter has Just challenged George
Whitney for a match in singles to be
played in the near future.
The California Club's grounds have been
retouched during the week. The courts
have been painted and a general renova
tion has brightened up the place consid
erably. The lady players have not been
patronizing the courts during the last few
days. Miss Mason, the new champion, is
the only lady player who has been on the
courts this week.
HANDBALL AMONG
JUVENILE PLAYERS
Handball is picking up again and in
the near future some very interesting

WILL COURSE FOR
DIVERS
KINDS OF COIN.
The coursing dogs will pull down all
kinds of coin again this week. And all
kinds of dogs will compete. At Union
Park the card embraces a puppy stake.
With forty-four youngsters going to the
slips, and an open event with an entry
of forty-eight. Tho value of the two is
|852 ."0. At Ingleslde thore will also be
two stakes run off. a champion feature
and a special maiden feature. In the
SOME OF THE MOST PROMINENT BALL -PLAYERS OF THE COAST.
former there are thirty-six candidates
and they are of top notch class. In the
maiden event forty-eight longtails will
compete, and, as is usual with the class,
the competition will be replete with sur
priÃes. The total money at Ingleside is
$1000. The running at both parks will
open at the usual hour and continue
through to-morrow.
The puppy stake at Union Park is about
the best of its class ever run off on the
coast. It embraces several youngsters
that have already scored brackets, and
also several that have never before been
shown. The result will be in doubt un
til the final flag is lifted.
Arthur Massey has his lines out for
both stakes at Ingleside, but he will
hardly land either. Still, his Eastern
canines should land a good slice of the
monfcy. Hotstuff and Hatlwist are both
hounds of class, and Branty and Hattel
have both begun to show improved form.
But the dogs that win at Ingleside this
week will needs show the hottest kind of
form.
Cronin has a puppy at Union Park that
was once called St. Patrick, later The
Celt, and to-day is known as Wild Tralee.
If the youngster does not win this week
he should be givÂ«-n a handful of earth
from the Irish fair.
Rock Island Boy and Victor King, pup
pies owned by Russell & Wilson, are run
ning at Union Park to-day for the first
time since their arrival on the coast. As
both have been here for several weeks
they should be prepared to show their
quality.
The number of canine candidates now
adays seeking entry at the two parks
is suggestive of the political situation.
At least thirty were unable to obtain en
try at Ingleside this week and many
were also left out at Union Park. Money
has< done it. The coast and, in fact, the
entire country has been scoured for dogs.
Every available dog has been bred and
the puppies reared for racers. The ken
nels are crowded until, even with two
parks running to their full capacity, two
days' coursing a week will not permit
all to run as often or half as often as is,
by their owners, desired.
In the long odds book for the open stake
at Union park. Cavalier, Theron. Right
Bower and Maud S appear to have the
call. Firm Friend is also in the game.
A year ago tills week the total money
available for the dog owners waa $190
and the number of dogs entered was
thirty-Blx. The number of dogs running
at the two parks to-day is 176 and the
total money is almost ten times $190.
The course between Connemara and
Billy Gladstone, which constituted the
final in the champion stake at Ingleside
last Sunday, but was not run on account
of fog, will be pulled off to-morrow just
before lunch. The tajent, as is natural,
can see nothing but Connemara, but the
puppy is not to be despised by any means.
Ralph Taylor, accompanied by Joe
Spencer, arrived from the East last
Wednesday with a string of eleven flyers
from beyond the mountuins. Among the
number are Hughey (a half brother to
For Freedom), Nick Irvln, Bonfire, Mas
ter Denmark, Scattercust, a Winning
Style sapling and several other young
sters. They expect to winter on the
coast.
The A and B kennels are showing a
famous performer at Union Park this
week in Kentish Girl. She is an Kng
lish importation and in the mother land
of coursing is said, to have been classed
with For Freedom. She arrived in the
city one week ago last Thursday. In her
trial work she has shown quality, but
she can hardly be expected to show her
true quality for another week or two.
Arthur Massey has sent Kant for a
string of fourteen saplings. They will
reach the coast between the Ist and sth
of October.
The likeliest flag raisers in the first
round of the non-winner stake at Ingle
slde to-day appear to be Our Boy, News
boy, Hobson, Matchless, Phoebe, Van
Kirk, Springfield, Magnet, Masterpiece,
Monitor, Silkwood, Glen Chloe, Rush o'
Hill, Systematic, Tullamore, Clifton Lass,
L, S. Conley, Chiquita, Kerry Gow,
Wheel of Fortune. Jimmy Cork, Rosalie,
Montana, Gilt .Edge.
The winners for the opening rounds at
Union Park to-day and to-morrow look
to be as follows: Puppy stake â Sunburst,
St. Gertrude, Campania, Rest Assured,
Maid of Bail, Blacklock, Miss Skyball,
Golden Russet, Jersey Lily, Bull Hill,
Sheridan, Admiral Dewfy, Brutus, Beauty

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, AUGUST 27, 1898.
HELD OF SPORT
REVIVAL OF THE
INTEREST
IN CYCLE RACING.
The revival of Interest In cycle racing
is shown by the number of men In train
ing for the big meet at San Jose on Ad
mission day, September 9. to be held in
conjunction with the Native Sons' cele
bration. There have already been t-ent
into the managers of the meet, the Gar
den City Wheelmen, a larger number of
advance entries than is usual, with many
who are known to be training yet to be
heard from. The stars of the meet will
probably be Wing. "Bunt" Smith, Fuller,
Ross, Davidson and Treadwell, with per
haps the addition of Gooch and A. T.
Smith.
The Garden City Wheelmen have about
given up the idea of having a match
race between Wing and some other good
rider, as the other man, the equal of
Wing, is hard to find, now that Peck has
given up racing. "Bunt" Smith might
be induced to go on.
The club tried to get up a five or ten
mile match race between teams of five
men from the Hay City Wheelmen and
Olympic Club Wheelmen, but this could
not be brought about, so that they have
about decided to put on a mile invita
tion, which should bring out all the
crackajacks above named and a few
others. This will therefore make up the
programme of events as follows: Two
thirds mile scratch, one mile handicap
and one mile invitation, the latter race
restricted to the >,<-st men in the ama
teur class, and probably tandem paced.
Entries close September 2 with George
E. Owens, San Jose. Cal. The fee for
each event Is 50 cents.
Encouraged by the lrterest shown In
the San Jose meet, the Klmhurst track
will be reopened on Sunday, September
4, the principal event to be a match race
between A. P. Deacon of the Reliance
Club and A. T. Smith of the Acme Club.
There will be three races, one-half mile
unpaced, one mile single paced, and flve
mifes tandem paced, winner of two out
of three to be victor In the match. A
mile handicap open to all will also be put
on. probably, to cater to the outside
J. E. Wing has postponed his trial
against the ten-mile Fruitvale-Haywards
record until September 4, when he can
get the proper pacing. He should have
no difficulty In lowering tke present
mark, 24:27.
The annual watermelon run of the Ter
minal City Wheelmen of Stockton will be
held to-morrow. Visitors from this city
will take the 6 p. m. river boat to-night,
returning early Monday morning.
The Olympic Club Wheelmen, under
Captain W. L. Loos, will have a run to
Lake Como, in Marin County, to-morrow,
a new journey to most of the members.
Charles A. Kraft of the Bay City
Wheelmen left for the East last Tuesday
morning, and will try the long-distance
racing game there, with good chances of

The California Cycling Club will hold
another of its popular ladies' nights next
Monday evening, August 29. This form
of entertainment has proven very at

Mr. Peckham was gla-d to get back, and
spent all day yesterday and Thursday
about the city, renewing old acquaint
ances. He expects to go East In a few
days. The Moana also brought advices
fro"m Harry Austin Goddard, who Is trav
eling in Australia for the Cleveland peo
ple. In a letter he speaks of being very
much impressed with the sporting in
stincts of the people at the antipodes, and
no longer wonders why a horse or bicycle
race draws from 25,000 to 40,000 people on
a Saturday afternoon. With this immense
attendance they are in a position to of
fer Immense prizes and secure the best
talent. They are behind the Americans
in track improvements, however, for the
"Austral" handicap, the great race of
the year, is run on a grass track, one
third of a mile In circumference and not
banked an inch. To Goddard, who had
a distinct recollection of sliding down the
steep banks of the old cement track at
Central Park and breaking his collar
bone, this seemed strange and It looKed as
If trick riding would discount speed.
The Capital City Wheelmen hope soon
to have negotiations settled whereby they
will be assured of having their track, re
cently destroyed by lire, rebuilt. Three
fourths of the track remains Intact. It
will be necessary to wholly reconstruct
the scratch straightaway and the grand
stand and about one-third of the high
fencing. The insurance money will cover
most of the cost of reconstruction, and
the club hopes the electric railway com
pany will see its way clear to put up the
balance. The cnances are In favor of Its
Â°Th% annual meeting of the Bay City
Wheelmen will be held next Thursday
evening, September 1. Reports of officers
and committees will be read, and a nomi
nating committee elected to name the of
ficers for the succeeding term.

ROWERS BEGIN TO
TRAIN FOR
CHAMPIONSHIPS.
The representatives of the San Fran
cisco rowing clubs who went to the As
toria regatta have now all returned, some
by train early in the week and others by
boat later. All enjoyed themselves highly
and received the best treatment from the
Astorians. The defeat of the "Midgets"
by the Alamedas has disappointed the
South End men very much, and is the
more surprising when the fact 'â - taken
into account that the Alameda barge had
no rudder in the race, but was steered by
a paddle. The Midgets do not seem to
have rowed themselves out, and in an
other race may turn the tables on tlTe
Alamedas.
In the barge event at Astoria between
the Alameda and Burrard Inlet crews the
latter pulled in the South End boat. With
George Alexander as stroke they rowed a
splendid race. Up to a few hundred yards
from the finishing line they were equal
with or slightly ahead of the Alameda
boat, which was struck by a wave and
swamped.
The defeat of Dr. C. C. Dennis by Oehs
and A. W. Pape was unexpected, and is
attributed to his lack of condition. He
will train carefully and try to hold his
own against them in the senior skiff
championship at HI Campo. The cham
pionship races will thus be unusually in
teresting this year. F. Duplissea won the
single shell race at Astoria, defeating Me-
Common and Patton of Portland, and
should win the senior shells here.
The Alameda club will give a reception
next Saturday to S. J. Pembroke, who
worked hard to get the best representa
tives of the bay clubs up to Astoria, and
to the members of the senior barge crew.
Two delegates from each of the clubs
represented at Astoria will draft resolu
tions to be sent to the Astoria committee
In appreciation of their generous reception
Of the visitors.
At the Bemi-monthly meeting of the
Alameda Boat Club, held last Tuesday,

of the Income to form a fund for the
purchase of new boats. Two appli
cations for membership were received.

and the club house will soon be ;itted
with wires and lamps. The Junior oars
men are practicing regularly, and bid
fair to make a good barge crew. B. Guild
1b working well.
M. Breon and J. Lyons of the Sourh
Ends are training for the Junior skiff
championship, and the Junior barge
crews are practicing. After a month's
practice the barge crews will be triel
out, and the four best men selecte-1. An
intermediate barge crew will probably be
formed by T. Barry, who rowed in the
championship Junior crew in 1890. The
club will try to purchase a skiff in
which Dr. C. C. Dennis may defend the
championship. F. Duplissea and J. Fo
ley will uphold the honor of the South
Ends in the Senior shell race.
Early next month the club *.vill give
a dinner to its representatives at the As
toria regatta. On November 1 an enter
tainment will be given at Union square
Hall to raise money for *r-e completion
of the handball court in the club house.
At the meeting last Tuesday Dr. J. P.
McCarthy was initiated.
Several members of the Olympic Boat
Club being on their vacations, the pro
posal to establish the club on a new
footing has been allowed to drop for the
present, but will be taken up later. Lit
tle has been done lately at the Tiburon
boat house, as the barge is being put into
repair, scraped and varnished.
The Dolphins have sustained a great
loss by the (loath of T. J. Hopkins, who
had been a member of the club for three
years. At the last Dolphin regatta he
rowed In the "Irish" barge crew, and
won the A. B. Treadwell medal for Jun
ior skiffs. He was a splendid young fel
low and much Uked by all who knew
him.
On Sunday Victor Caglieri, T. J. Sulli
van, J. Earles and W. O. Patch went
out for barge practice. A. W. Pape be
gins training to-day, and henceforward
the Intermediate crew will go out three
times a week. Victor Caglieri and E.
J. Bartman will represent the Dolphins
in the championship Junior skiff race.

SPEEDY YACHTS
MAY WIN
FINE TROPHIES.
It Is probable that silver cups will be
awarded in each class at the Pacific In
terclub Yacht Association's regatta on
September 9. Already three handsome
trophies, known as the Law cup, the
Delegates' cup and the Macdonough cup,
are in the hands of the association, and
provision will be made for a fourth. The
winning yacht in each class will get a
championship flag as well, and the second
yacht will receive a mug, with a suitable
Inscription. A handsome design has been
chosen for the Macdonough cup, upon
which the association flag, now containing
six stars, will be enameled in blue and
white. Each club in the association will
be assessed $30. Some amendments to the
constitution, by-laws and racing rules
were accepted at the meeting of the as
sociation held on Wednesday night. A
circular will be issued in a few days to
yacht-owners by the secretary with re
gard to the Admission day regatta. The
association is not disposed to interpret
the rule regarding professionals strictly,
inasmuch as it believes its duty to be the
encouragement of all yacht racing,
whether by amateurs or professionals,
and holds that a sallmaker or a boat
builder may be a genuine amateur yachts
man.
Last Sunday Commodore Dr. T. L. Hill
cruised in his sloop Cygnus with a party
of artillerymen and soldiers of the Sev-
I onth Regiment to Marln Islands. Vice-
Commodore G. T. S. White's sloop Will o'
the "Wisp accompanied the flagship. A. D.
I Naylor's sloop Twilight took a party of
ladles to Paradise Cove. With the ex
j ception of a "calm streak" here and there
there was a good breeze all day. The
' schooner White Wings, which has been
j up at Suisun and Antioch. has returned
to her moorings at Sausalito. W. S.
I Goodfellow's schooner La Paloma made
i excellent time on her trip up from San
i Luis Obiapo. She is now lying in Oakland

ing broken her centerboard pin, did
not leave her moorings.
On September 11 the Corinthians will
have a small regatta off El Campo, the
circulars announcing which will be sent
out very shortly. It is expected that there
will be a good list of entries in the two
classes â the twenty-live-footers and the
twenty-footers. The sloops Phoenicia,
Merope and others will be put in trim for
the association regatta on the 9th, and,
bar accidents, will be ready to race again
in two days later. The regatta will be
under the management of the regatta
committee, which consists of J. H. Hopps,
P. J. Martenstein and W. F. Dlxey. In
addition to the usual flags, two prizes â
probably cupsâ will be offered.
The Encinal ladies' cruise to San Mateo,
originally set for June 4 and 5 but post
poned on account of the inability of the
Hotel Mateo to provide suitable accom
modation on those days, will probably
take place on September 3, 4 and 5. Dr.
C. T. Tisdale, president of the Enclnals
and of the Pacific Interclub Yacht As
sociation has recently been at Sacra
mento. The sloop Lapwing, formerly of
the Encinals, has been bought by a mem
ber of the Corinthian Club.
The Callfornias have a ladles' cruise to
Paradise Cove to-morrow, and the South
Hays a cruise to Ravenswood. A. A.
Pattiani and B. W. Robeon have sold the
sloop Volante, which will be taken by her
new owner to Bay Farm Island. A. C.
Lee has brought his sloop Surprise down
from Point Pinole, where he has been
for the past three months. A. M. Clay,
through the kindness of \V. Letts Oliver,
has recovered his small boat, lost some
weeks ago. The sloops Sea Fox and Em

REVOLVER SHOTS
PRACTICINC
FOR A BIG MATCH.
A number of the members of the Col
umbia Pistol and Rifle Club of this city
are preparing for an interesting revolver
match with a team of the Brooklyn Re
volver Club of Brooklyn, N. Y. It is
understood that the match will take place
in about six weeks, the scores to be ex
changed by telegraph on the day of the
shooting. F. O. Young and J. E. Gor-
man made the preliminary arrangements
for the match when thoy were In at
tendance at the National Bundfest at
Glendale, N. Y. The members of the
San Francisco club realize that they have
no walkover in this match, as the Brook
lyn club has on its roll of seventy mem
bers some of the best revolver shots in
the country. About twenty of this East
ern organization are physicians and they
all meet twice a week and practice and
hold contests on an indoor range, shoot
ing ten, fifteen and twenty yards. As
many of the members of that club are
now practicing for a team match with a
Cincinnati club, they will be in fine
form to make things lively for their Cal
ifornia opponents.
All of the details of the match have
not as yet been arranged. Two points,
however, have been decided. The Col
umbia men. who always shoot on the
fifty-yard outdoor range will shoot at the
Brooklyn men's distance â twenty yards
provided the latter will shoot on the
Columbia target. The Brooklynites
wanted to have each team consist of only
three men, for they have that many
"nail drivers" in their club, but the Col
umbia's representations insisted that the
teams should be from seven to ten men
each, so as to give the average marks
man a chance. Of the members of the
Columbia Club who can hold a steady
revolver and can be relied upon in a
match, there are F. O. Young, J. E.
Gorman, A. H. Pape, Ed Hovey, C. M.
Dalss. Howard Carr, Smith Carr, Dr. L.
O. Rodgers, F. E. Mason and a few
others, but for some time past they have
neglected to practice with this firearm.
In the coming match the club will miss
a fine shot in A. B. Dorrell, who will be
in the southern part of the State at that
time.
There Is a strong desire on the part of
the Columbia's men to have the match
shot with full service charges of powder,
as they believe that shooting light weight
or gallery charges is more like child's
play than revolver work. It is feared
that the Eastern team .will kick against
being confined to full service charges, as
many have made their best records on
the short ranges with heavy revolvers
loaded with little firecracker charges.
The English, at least those who met
recently on the range at Bieley, insist
upon full charge ammunition, and that
is said to be why Walter Winans. one of
the best revolver shots of the East, did
not attend the meeting at Bisley this
year. C. S. Axtell of the Smith & Wes
son Revolver Club is an exponent of
heavy ammunition, and he was very suc
cessful, tying Lieutenant Lowther of the
Scot Guards for first place in the twenty
yard match recently at stationary target
All of the Columbia's men believe in the
standard upheld by Axtell and the Eng
lish marksmen, full service ammunition
for all kinds of revolver shooting

DEER SHOOTING
AND
TROUT FISHING.
The lovers of deer shooting are making
' the best of the few weeks that are open
to them in some of the near-by counties
to bag the largest deer of the season. So
far very good reports have been received
from the hunters who hunted and did not
sit in the shade of an inviting redwood,
expecting a visit from some of the cu
riously inclined animals, who, as a rule,
are not afraid of a lazy sportsman.
Last Sunday an imense buck was killed
on the Spring Valley preserve by A. Bo
rer the well-known banker, who was
deer stalking with some friends. Mr
Borel dropped the animal at the first
shot and an idea of its size may be
gained from the fact that it weighed,

CRICKETERS HONOR
A DEAD COMRADE
A communication has been received
from the secretary of the Honolulu
Cricket Club, In which he says that the
letter of the California Cricket Associa
tion will be placed before his club at its
next meeting, to be held # shortly. The
association has promised to do all in its
power to render a visit of cricketers from
Hawaii to this State pleasant, but it can
not undertake to render it remunerative.
In the present depressed condition of
cricket In California" It would not be pos
sible to attract a sufficient attendance at a
match to render the hiring of an inclosed
ground profitable. But players who are
looking for an agreeable trip - can cer
tainly get It. Matches can be arranged
in San Francisco, Placer County, Lake
port, San Jose, and probably at Burns
Valley.
The committee appointed to draft reso
lutions relative to the death of the late
A. E. Coates, for four years one of the
vice-presidents of the association, has
performed its task, and copies of the reso
lutions have been forwarded to Mrs.
Coates and to the Placer County Cricket
Club. The resolutions were as follows:
"Whereas intelligence has been received
of the passing away on the 19th day of
July, IS9S, of A. E. Coates, for several
years one of the vice-presidents of the
California Cricket Association; be it
"Resolved. That as an association we
hereby express our profound regret for
the loss of one of the most widely known
and respected cricketers In the State of
California. Allied with ovr sorrow at his
loss there is the melancholy gratification
of being able to place on our records the
fact that our friend was one of the men of
whom it can be said, 'His word was as
good as his bond.' He was kind and cour
teous to all. with whom he was brought in
contact, either in business or social rela
tions.
"Resolved. That the secretary of the
association record this testimony in mem
ory of our late colleague upon the min
utes of the association, and that a copy
thereof me sent to the family of the de
ceased and to the Placer County Cricket
Club. EDWARD BROWN.

AUSTRALIA SAILS FOR HONO
' ; LULU ON TEE FIRST.
â¢
â â Numerous Place Hunters After the I
â¢ Positions of Attorney and Chief
Wharfinger to the Har- j
â¢ bor Commission.
â  Two old-time San Francisco vessels are
In trouble In Australian waters. The
bark Leon while on her way from New
â  castle, N. S. w., to Honolulu sprang a
leak and had to put Into Whangaroa. a
small port In New Zealand, in distress.
â¢while the barken tine Monitor sprang a
leak in Sydney harbor and sank at her
mooring- An attempt was made to get j
her on the mud flats, but It failed, and.
when the Moaiia left Australia the Moni- j
tor's decks were awash at high water.
â¢ The Leon Is an old-timer, having been
built nt Sestri Ponente in 1576. At one |
time she was owned by the late Nicholas
chard, and was then known as the !
"Don Carlos. Then she was rechristened
â¢the. Quang Tung and later the Principe
di Lucedto. . Last of all J. J. Moore &
Co. purchased her, and placing her under
.the Xicaragi:an flag renamed her Leon.
She sailed from here with a cargo of
.lumber, and after discharging. loaded coal
for - , the Hawaiian Islands. She has now
been sold as she lies In Whangaroa har- ]
ho-r to J. J. Craig of Auckland, New Zea- !
lard, and will be used by him In the |
coasting trade. Captain Bergman, who
â  was In command of the Leon, has re- j
turned to San Francisco, and Captain '
â Williams, who was mate with Bergman, j
. is now in command of the vessel.
The Marion was built at Boston, Mass..
In ISSS, so she has had a longer lease â¢
-of life than the l.Â« on. She was formerly '
; owned by T. H. Minor of this city, but
-.was sold a few months ago to O. G. S. j
â Lane of Sydney, N. S. W. Both vessels
-..were particularly well known on this
'.-.coast, and the chances .ire now that they
-. will', never be seen here again.
' . The Oceanic Steamship Company's Aus
tralia, which has been in use as a trans
port for the past few months, has Just
' been returned to her owners by the Gov
, e'rhment and will resume her run on the \
. Honolulu route. She will leave here Sep- j
' tember 1. and as there has been an ac
cumulation of freight and passengers ow
ing to the short service, she is sure to go
'"out crowded.
â¢The Harbor Commissioners have their
â¢â¢ hands full with applicants for office these
'days. The nominations of Tlrey L. Ford
for Attorney General and George W.
Root for Clerk of the Supreme Court
â will leave the position of attorney for the
board and chief wharfinger vacant, and
there are a host of applicants for the
â  positions. The chances are that W. H.
Alford will become the legal adviser of
â¢the commission, and that Harry S. Scott J
will become chief wharfinger. Mr. Scott j
Is undoubtedly the man for the office. As
assistant chief wharfinger he has made
.'a record of which any man might be
proud. Courteous to all he has made
friends of every- snip captain and ship
owner In the port, and all of them -would
.hail with delight his. promotion. . Will
.Ashe is a candidate for the position also,

George Edwards of 2% Sansome street is
much exercised over the' fear that the

In a letter addressed to the Harbor Com

be protected with a wire netting, so as
â¢ to prevent the fall of the broken glass.
. For the Information of Mr. Edwards and
' all passengers of the ferry boats the Har
bor Commissioners state that all the glass j
used In the. depot was molded In wire
â  netting with a three-quarter Inch mesh, ]
so that at no . time can a piece of glass
larcer than the mesh fall, unless the en

GENERAL LONGSTREET IN THE CITY.
As United States Railroad Commissioner He Will
Inspect Central Pacific Lines.
General James Longstreet. of Gainesville, Ga., arrived In this city
last evening with his wife, and registered at the Palace. The general,
who was lately appointed United States Railroad Commissioner by
President McKlriey to succeed General Wade Hampton of South
Carolina, is making his first official visit to this coast. The main pur
port of his presence here is to make the annual inspection for the
Government of the Central Pacilk- lines in California, Utah and Ne
vada. He has already made considerable progress in his investiga
tions, and expects to be occupied for three or four days in this city,
and from here he will go north. He expects to be finished with his
task by October 1, and he will make a report to the Secretary of the
Interior, to whom he is directly subject.
"I really have nothing to say except that I am making an official
examination of the bonded and landed railroads which are under ob
ligations to the Government," he said last night. "The Central Pa
cific is the only road which comes under that category, as the Union
Pacific has settled its dues. As to the particulars of my investiga
tions so far, I must remain silent, but after I have made my returns
to my immediate superior they will no doubt be made public."
General Lonpstreet, despite his 77 years, is remarkably vigorous,
and still gives evidence of the powerful qualities of mind and body
which made him one of the first Confederate generals of the civil war.
This is not the first time he has held public office. He was appointed
Minister to Turkey by President Hayes, and was recalled by Presi
dent Garfleld who made him United States Marshal for the Northern
District of Georgia, where he is a power, regardless of political lines.
He has also been Postmaster of Gainesville. His people say that next
to Stonewall Jackson, he was the most daring and persistent war
rior on the Confederate side. General Grant made him Surveyor of
the Port and finally Postmaster of New Orleans, to which place he
had moved, just after General Lee had advised the acceptance of
the terms of surrender. Despite the troubles brought on him by his
prompt espousal of reconstruction, General Longstreet has always
remained in the South, where he enjoys the personal respect of his
neiThbors, and is always sure of the faithful love of his army com
rades.
The general was married about a year ago in a romantic manner
to Miss Ellen Dortch, who at that time was Assistant State Libra
rian, and who made a vigorous campaign during the Legislature for
the passage of a bill allowing women to hold certain offices in the
State. Although the general was JBBt three times her age he wooed
and won her, and they were married at the Governor's mansion.
In the general's party are Colonel C. C. Sanders and wife, Mrs. M.
A. Sanders, Mrs. J. H. Hunt and Miss M. A. Sanders, all residents of
Gainesville.
JUDGES REFUSE
TO TRY A CASE
The ways of Police Judges are some
times peculiar and difficult to compre
hend. An instance occurred yesterday
that caused a great deal of unfavorable
comment.
When the case of Attorney E. M.
Comyns, charged wfth petty larceny by
trick and device in obtaining possession
of and bashing a receipt for &0 bail
money put up by Peter Cunningham, the
old miser, was called in Judge Joachim
sen's court yesterday morning, Attorney
J. N. E. Wilson, on behalf of Comyns,
submitted an affidavit by Comyns to the
effect that he could not get a fair trial
by the Judge, and demanding a change of
venue. Prosecuting Attorney Graham
objected, but the Judge said he had no
particular desire to try the case, and
granted the request. â 
Wilson and Comyns went before Judge
Conlan, and Comyns asked him to try the
case, but he demurred, and later ex
plained that he was to be called as a wit
ness by Comyns, and could not, there
fore,- sit as a Judge. Besides; Cunning
ham has been convicted and sentenced by
him on the charge of vagrancy, and it
was in connection with that case that
Comyns was arrested.
Judge Mogan was then approached by
Wilson and Comyns, but he refused to
have anything to do with the case, on the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, AUGUST 27, 1898.
ground that he was kept busy every day
from 10 till late in the afternoon with
other cases, and, besides, he did not pro
pus.- that his court should be made a
dumping ground by the police. When a
"star" case came up the police took It to
another court, a.s, for instance, the Bot
j kin case, Judge Joachimsen having been
! sent lor, although he was holding court
i all that afternoon.
Judge Low is on his vacation, and Wil
son and Corny ns had to fall back upon
the Justices of me Peace. They went to
Groezinger, and he at once consented to
try the Â«case. They returned to Judge
: Joaehimsen, who positively declined to
i allow Groezinger to sit in his court. The
i Judge had, however, discovered mean
i time that Judge Hunt had rendered a de
cision in the case of Pardini, asking for a
; change of venue from the late Judge
I Campbell's court, that there was nothing
in the statutes compelling a Police Judge
; to assign a case to another department.
' He therefore Informed Wilson and
, Comyns that he would ignore the affida
vit asking for a change of venue, and
would put the case on his calendar for
trial to-day.
CaptaWi Seymour is taking a keen in
terest In the Comyns case, as he Is de
i termlned to protect prisoners as far as
! he can against being imposed on by attor
! neys". He was very much chagrined at
the stand tn.ken by the Police Judges, aa
; he had hoped they would have been only
too anxious to aid him In his work of
purification.

THE POWELL'S
CREW BLAMED
Inquest on the Death of
Mrs. Paxton.
TESTIMONY IS CONFLICTING
WITNESSES SAY THE LAUNCH
CHANGED HER COURSE.-
This Is Denied by Her Officers and
the Jury Censured the Crew
of the Government
Boat.
Coroner W. J. Hawkins held an in
quest yesterday on the body of Mrs. Flora
L. Paxton, who lost her life in the colli
sion between the General McDowell and
the Scandia's launch last week. The jury,
after listening to the evidence, brought
in a verdict of drowning, due to the care
lessness of the officers of the General Mc-
Dowell.
Several witnesses were called, and the
testimony throughout was conflicting. All
those who were aboard the launch and
would acknowledge that they did not lose
their heads insisted that she never
changed her course, while the officers and
crew of the McDowell anu eyewitnesses
of the collision declared that the launch
was clear of the McDowell, but changed
her course.
Captain Hart of the Scandia, one of the
passengers on the launch, testified as fol
lows: "When we left the wharf we blew
one long whistle, according to regulations,
and just as we wt-re about clearing the
head of the wharf we saw the McDowell
bearing toward us and about 100 yards
away. We again blew one whistle, signi
fying that we were entiled to the right of
way, and she answered. We were going
ahead full speed and did our best to get
out of the way, but the McDowell over
took us, struck us on the port helm and
turned us over."
A. J. Thompson, third officer of the
Scandia, who was in charge of the launch
at the time, gave testimony corroborating
that of Captain Hart. He acknowledged,
however, that when the vessels were
about 30 feet apart he saw that a collision
was Inevitable and put his helm to port.
He does not consider that this threw the
launch out of her course, but thinks that
she might have been thrown out some
by the wash from the larger boat. Don
aid Hiliman, engineer of the launch; John
Daly, fireman, and Quartermaster Sca
rini all testified that the launch went
straight on her course without slowing
down.
The testimony of Mate Grimm, who was
in charge of the McDowell, put the mat
ter In an entirely different light. "We
had been over to Angel Island pumping
water," he said, "and when we were
about 500 feet from Pacific-street wharf
I heard the launch whistle. I answered
and .slowed down, and then signaled the
engineer to stop and reverse, as our swing
was carrying us in too close. The launch
was so far ahead that I could see day
light between her stern and our bow,
and she hail plenty of time to get out of
the way. The people aboard her suddenly
seemed to get rattled and changed her
course, turning In shore. We were car
ried up to her and struck her starboard
quarter. We could not have struoÃ her
starboard side if she was ahead of us
and had she not changed her course the
accident would not have happened. Mem
bers, of the crew of the tugboat testified
that they did not see the accident, but
that they knew the McDowell had slowed
'i v ;i, stopped, reversed and lowered a
boat.
John Lindsay, a soldier stationed at Al
entraz. who stood In the bow of the Mc-
Dowell at the time of the accident, cor
roborated Mate Grimm's testimony in
every particular, as did Peter Brown and
H. P. Huggard, who witnessed the acci
dent from the *>nd of Pier 9.
INTERSTATE CLUB
HAS WON ITS SUIT
A DECISION IN ITS FAVOR IS
HANDED DOWN.
Dissatisfied Members of the Cours
ing Organization Cannot ironn
a Rival Corporation and
Usurp Its Name.
A decision in the action of the Interstate
Coursing Club of California against Dom
lnlck Shannon. John Grace, P. J. Relily,
j Michael Treanor, James Dean, T. Mc
j Hugh, James Grace and IÂ». H. Brown,
I Secretary of State, In which the plaintiff
sought to restrain the defendants from
usurping and Infringing upon its corpor
ate title, was handed down by Judge Sea
i well yesterday. The court ordered that
judgment be entered against the defend
ants and an order Issue restraining the
issuance by the Secretary of State of a
certificate of Incorporation under the
name, "Interstate Coursing Club of Cali
fornia."
Not long ago the defendants were con
nected with the plaintiff corporation in
I various capacities. Differences of opin
ion regarding certain matters, however,
resulted in the defendants withdrawing
from the organization and establishing v
similar one of their own. In January of
the present year articles of incorporation
of the Interstate Coursing Club of Califor
nia were filed, In which the defendants
appeared as directors. Suit for an in
junction by the directors of the original
Interstate Coursing Club of California
i was filed and a temporary writ was Is
sued. The plaintiff alleged that the de
fendants had conspired together to de
prive the plaintiff of the good will and
reputation of the club name, and it was
for that purpose that the articles of In
corporation were filed. Defendants made
answer and the suit was a hotly con
tested one, and resulted yesterday In
victory for the plaintiff.
The suit filed by the trustees of the vic
torious corporation against the same
named defendants to establish the title
to the property and assets of the Inter
state Coursing Club of California was or
dered dismissed.
This disposes of the entire litigation,
and unless thÂ« defendants appeal from
the decision the plaintiff will enter into
the peaceful pursuit of the sport for
which it was organized. â¢

THE AMERICAN KENNEL
CLUB'S CLASSIFICATION
An official communication has been ad
dressed by A. P. Vredenburgh to the
secretary of the San Francisco Kennel
Club as follows:
The clarification as laid down by the A.
X C Is naming the classes that a show can
open, and dottnlnit name, if opened, but the
opening of any of the clauses iÂ» not compul
sory The A K. C. says the following classes
may' be provided by dog nhow committees. It
does not say -'must 1 ' or "shall," but simply
may Therefore a show has the matter of class
es solely within its own control, and ir It so
elects can give a show with only open classes.
It can provide one. two, throe, four or five
classes--, or selected breed?.
It la foolish for a show, because It hns the
right to do ao, to open full classification for
all breeds. Such a plan is never attempted
outside of California. New York, thÂ« most im
portant show In the country, never attempts to
give all classes in the less important breeds.
ThiÃ letter is timely, and if the advice
therein contained be followed by the Pa
cific Coast clubs an era of renewed pros
perity may be confidently awaiting
them.
The report of the late convention, to
gether with a. representation by the mi
nority, was forwarded to the American
Kennel Club on Saturday. It may be
stated that only the latter will be con
sidered by the American Kennel Club, as
all the rules were violated by those who
voted in the majority. The American
Kennel Club allows no one to represent
more than one club, or to cast more
than one vote. H. T. Payne voted twice
over, debarred from participation by rea
son of disqualification. . ,
The Pacific Mastiff Club wHI hold its
regular monthly meeting at S o'clock this
evening at 405 Powell street.
Emmet V. Sullivan has lost his fox
terrier, Menlo Creek, the highest priced
dog of his breed ever brought out here.
It is supposed that the dog strayed from
the house of a friend of his owner. Mr.
Sullivan is much distressed at his loss
and offers a substantial reward for the
recovery.
The reason of False Flatterer's poor
running of late became apparent on ex
amination of the dog's tail. The bone
was decayed and Mr. George Bell suc
cessfully amputated six inches. Flat
terer is now doing well, and as soon as
the wound is healed and he has under
gone some training his owner expects
him to outdo all previous performances.
The match with Connemara will be re
newed and heavy odds laid on Flat
terer.
Al Byler has entirely broken up his
Cocker spaniel kennels and has presented
H. H. Carlton with Oakside Duchess and
three pups. Mr. Carlton's Trilby has
thrown six pups, two black and four red,
so that gentleman may be said to be
"long" on Cockers at present.
Mrs. J. P. Norman's mastiff bitch, Lola,
is the proud and happy mother of four
sons and three daughters. More addi
tions to the canine population are ex
pected this week in the collie and St.
Bernard breeds.
Apropos of the holy breed, the Oakland
Kennel- Club has about decided to aban
don the show projected for next month.
It is proposed instead to hold a show
here in December for St. Bernards and
collies. A large will be called out
if the plan be executed, and there is
every prospect of its resulting in a finan
cial success.

THE RAISIN TRADE.
ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE CROP OF IS9S
IS CONCENTRATED.
The California Raisin Growers' Association
of Fresno is out with the following circular:
FRESNO. California, Aug. 27, IS9S.
To the Trade: The California Raisin Grow
ers' Association has been organized for the
purpose of establishing a high standard of
quality of all raisins to be sold under its
brand, to put a stop to the shipment of inferior
raisins, and to fix and maintain a reasonable
price for the product throughout the year,
' from harvest time to harvest time.
The directors of this association believe that
If the so ideas are faithfully carried out the
dealers in raisins will take more Interest in
this particular product, will purchase more
freely and will push the sale of raisins arid
thus greatly Increase our market.
At this writing we have under our control
over 90 per cent of the crop of the State, and
within two or three weeks we expect to secure
at least 5 per cent more. Our growers' con
tract places the raisins absolutely In our
hands to be packed and sold, under a penalty
of $20 per acre. 1 cent per pound of raisins,
liquidated damages for failure to deliver the
crop to us. Packers handling 95 per cent of the
crop have also signed contracts with us â  to
pack and Fell our raisins, and they are under
a penalty of $20 per ton not to pack, buy or sell
any raisins outside of our association. Under
our packers' contracts we retain control of the
raisins, and when sales are reported to us we
will Issue invoices direct to purchasers, and
have drafts and bills of lading made out to our
own order. Packers are at liberty to pay. us
cash for raisins and thus control shipments.
Dividing commission with purchasers will
compel us to withdraw our business from the
offender. No raisins will be shipped on con
signment. Purchasers will have â  the right to
examine goods on arrival before delivery and
paying draft. Packers guarantee to us sales
reported, provided the raisins are of the qual
ity Indicated by our inspector's mark on the
package. All raisins are to be packed under
the supervision of the inspectors appointed and
controlled by us. . -
We pledge ourselves to begin our sales at our
minimum prices, to raise prices moderately at
Intervals, and not to lower prices at any time
before the new crop comes In next year. If
through a scarcity of dried fruit, or for any
other cause, the market will justify It, we will
make larger advances In prices; but we have
no desire to check consumption by unduly In
creasing prices. Any surplus not wanted by
the market will be sold for export, or to the
â wineries for brandy making-
All sales will be made through the packers or
their selling agents, and -any orders sÂ»nt di
rectly to us will be returned to the sender with
the request that the purchase be made through
the channels above mentioned.
In view of the most unsatisfactory methods
of marketing our rulsin crop in practice dur
ing past years we confidently hope for the cor
dial support of the tradÂ» in our present efforts
to so manage the business that It will be a
source of profit and pleasure to all in any way
connected with the industry: and we desire to
call especial attention to seeded raisins which
are sure to become popular with all house
keepers as soon as their merits become known,
and which are now packed with great care and
in most attractive one-pound cartons. Very
truly yours,
California Raisin Growers' Association,
M. THEO. KEARNEY, President.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK BTOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Auk. 28.â Indications In tha
â took market late yesterday that the liquida
tion of profits was over for the present and
that powerful Interests were preparing to enter
on the long side, were party confirmed to-day.
Prices went up sharply at the opening, but
there were sufficient selling orders placed with
commission houses to reduce the gains In the
grangers and put a stop to the advance. The
enormous absorption of the Northern Pacific
stocks, however, was unabated and the ag
gressive strength shown by sugar also helped
the early rise. The large outside offerings to
take profits nerved materially to decrease the
buying movement, however, and a period of
dullness Intervened. It was terminated by the
sudden movement In Union Pacific, which rose
early above 32 and was held there for the
balance of the day. The preferred stock wu
also lifted to 67, and the movement extended to
the grangers and Southwestern railroads. The
Northern Pacific stocks suffered from profit
taking under cover of this diversion of specu
lation, but the advance in the general list was
continuous and the morket broadened so as to
embrace a large number of dormant stocks.
The grangers were all advanced to near the
high point on the present movement, and St.
Paul rose a sharp fraction above It. The closa
was strong.
Profit taking was In evidence In some of tha
speculative bonds to-day, but the standard
shares were generally steady. Total saiÂ«B,
$4, 770. 000.
Government bonds were unchanged.

LONDON MARKET.
NEVT YORK. Aug. 26.â The Evening Poft's |
financial cablegram says: Stocks were quiet
here to-day, except Americans, which were
active and strong. They opened quiet, but soon j
became buoyant on buying of Northern Pacific i
and Union Pacific from Berlin. St. Paul also j
advanced sharply on belated bears buying, the
only sellers being arbitrage houses, where fair
margins existed. New York also absorbed
stocks readily. Prices closed at the best and
arbitrage dealers expressed confidence of a fur- |
ther rise in spite of such factors a.Â« a fill in j
wheat. Canadian Pacific was sold from Berlin,
but it Bubsequently rallied with Americans.
Spanish exchange on London is higher, and
consequently Spain is again buying sliver.
A preliminary report issued by the Indian
Cusrency Commission, containing evidence of
experts, excites much attention. It is believed
in the best-informed quarters here that the
gold standard experiment will be tried.

FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK, Aug. 26.â Bradstreet's Finan
cial Review to-morrow will say: Reactionary
tendencies marked the early part of the week,
the market also showing a decrease of activity
and a falling off of the recent public Interest
In speculation. A firmer tone and a renewal of
the advancing; tendencies haÂ«, however, ap
peared In the last two days. There has been
no positive news of an unfavorable character
apart from rumors that warm weather was In
juring the corn crop at the West, and a hard
ening of the money market, which latter cir
cumstance Is partially offset by the easier ten
dency In rate* of exchange. The depression
may accordingly be charged partly to the heat
ed term, partly to the temporary falling off of
public Interest and partly to professional spec
ulators realizing on their purchases. There was
also renewed evidence of bearish manipulation,
and the sharp decline of Manhattan, which
waa one of the features of the week, was gen
erallj' charged to that cause. Its subsequent
firmness and recovery also seemed to represent
covering of a short Interest In It. While a few
stocks, notably Northern Pacific, were excep
tionally strong, the general list sagged off un
der realizing saJea and bearish pressure, thin
being apparent In the granger and other por
tions of the list that have recently made such
marked advances. London, while sending
prices higher, has, on the whole, been a seller
of our stocks on balance. The bond list has
been strong, though Its features have been
mainly cheap specialties like Texas Pacific
second Incomes and Standard Rope and Twine
securities. In all of which marked advances
have been scored.
Government bonds have not been as active,
as the demand for the older Issues has slack
ened and fractional recessions have been re
corded In some cases. The new 3 per cents,
after touching lOSV4, also receded to lOSH on
sales of allotments by subscribers for amounts
up to 14000, which this week received nottce of
acceptance.
DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK, Aug. 28.â R. O. Dun & Co.'v
weekly review of trade will ray: The voluma
of business reflected In exchanges at the prin-
cipal Clearing-houses is 20.4 per cent larger
than last year and 26.8 per cent larger than
In 1892, heretofore the year of largest business
and highest prosperity ever known. Part of this
Increase was due to speculation at New York,
but there are most healthy Increases over the
best of the previous years, and though in some
branches business is not satisfactory In char
acter, in nearly all it Is In volume larger than
ever before. No unfavorable change appears In
the prospect of crops, upon which the welfare
of thÂ» country largely depends, nor is there
present or threatening financial disturbance.
Europe has not wearied of buying American
securities, although some speculators nave been
selling, nor is there shown any want of con
fidence among American Investors. Compari
sons as to foreign trade are apt to mislead, be
cause imports last year were extraordinarily
small after the big rush to anticipate new
duties, while exports were beginning to show
the phenomenal demand which made the year
quite the most remarkable In our history.
Hence, of the decrease, 13 per cent from New
York In August thus far is not alarming, but
sales of products yet to be followed are large
and have stopped any advance in the current
rates of foreign exchange. Nor 1b It at all
disheartening that Imports at New York for the
month thus far exceed last year's by nearly
$5,000,000, since last year they fell below those
of 1596 by more than J4.000.000.
Wheat goes down 3 cents this week as if
there were no foreign demand coming, the
previous concert of farmers to keep back
wheat, the crop being certainly very large,
tending to enccurajfe a conspiracy of traders
agalnnt them, which thus far has entire con
trol of the market. Atlantic exports for the
week have been 2.731.594 bushels, against 3,668.
369 last year, and for four weeks of August
13.101.079 buyhels, against 13,378.638 last year,
while Pacific exports, 254, 2j3 bushels for the
,week, against 770, 51 9 last year, have been for
the month 1,303,794, against 1.405.333 last year.
It Is wise to remember that the foreign de
mand on account of last year's shortage Is
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, AUGUST 27, 1898.
still lapping over, while reports show that
foreign crops are about average.
The output of iron and steel no longer meas
ures the demand, and the stipulated stop
pages of furnaces In the Shenango and Ma
honing valleys has raised the price of besse
mer pig at Pitt.sburg to $10 50 and of gray
forge to t'J 25, without any certainty whatever
that such prices can be maintained when the
valley furnaces resume operations, as some of
them are now doing. The natural result Is
that the Pittsburg region Is bo much the less
able to compete with the great Illinois com
bine juet formed, which is getting all the
business it can do and promises to turn out
Iron at IcES cost than any other works in the
country At all polntÃ bars promise a lnrgpr
output than ever before and structural forms
and plates are In heavy demand, while the
tlnplnte producers have felt themselves obliged
to advance prices about ten cents per b6x and
the sales are said to be very heavy.
Failure* for the week have been- 1(9 In the
United States, against 223 last year, and 26 in
Canada, against 34 last year.
BRADSTREET'S REVIEW.
NEW YORK. Aug. 26â Bradstreet's to-mor
row will say: Business Interests In the main
reflect the continuance of most of the favor
able features hitherto dominating the trade
situation In the more favored section of the
country. Prominent In this direction, of course,
are the iron and steel and allied Industries in
which active demand, present and prospective,
has led to further price advances, sustained
and even increased activity in distribution at
most Western markets, with some Improvement
likewise rioted at the South and on the Pacific
Coast, steadiness in pricesâ wheat, corn and
cotton, however, exceptedâ a reduced number of
business failures, fair gains in railroad earn
ing as a whole, and bank clearings. In spite of
a slight reduction from last week, showing
heavy gains over all cciÂ»*spondlng periods in
previous years. The less^avorable elements in
the situation are the reports of arrested or
smaller than expected trade at Eastern mar
kets, particularly in textile lines, lower quota
tions and apparently less active demand from
abroad for our cereal products and reduced
prices paid for the Souths great Staple, raw
cotton. Qualifying the latter, might be men
tioned the fact that spring wheat has apparent
ly begun to move In the Northwest, and the
promise of large yields in wheat and cotton
alike has tended to depress prices.
In iron and' steel the strength developed has
been notable, and the confid'tH-e expressed is
striking in view of the willingness of new
buyers to immediately grant price demands.
The situation of the Iron and steel mills, how
ever, with order books filled for from thirty
to sixty days ahead, albeit much of this Is at
old prices, is one of aggressiveness, and numer
ous orders have been turned down because of
time limits demanded or set for delivery. Ad
vanced quotations for Bessemer pigiron, steol
billets, lead, copper and spelter are features
of the week, and even tinplate* show a gain
In prices after a long period of depression.
The feature of demand at Western markets
this week has be^n the inquiry from Jobbers
of dry goods, clothing and boots and shoes,
special activity being noted at Chicago, St.
Louis, St. Paul, Louisville and Omaha.
Whent shipments for the week, including
flour, aggregated r?.. r ifi3.47fi bushels, as against
3.959.34S bushels last week. 5.149.60 bushels in
the corresponding week of 1897. 3,271.854 bush

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Aug. 26.â The tendency at the
start in Wheat was toward weakness, but the
market soon turned strong and prices continued
to creep uj> tor an hour and a half, during
which time September rose from 63$Â»<3>63Tic at.
the start to 64% c. It . held firmly within %c
of the price mentioned another ; half hour. : and
then In about fifteen minutes undid all Its
previous work by dropping back ] once more
to 63%@63?ic The September future, 5 while
showing the widest range in values,, was not
the most heavily dealt In. The new business
was largely confined to December and May, in
which latter deliveries fluctuations were less
and the volume of trade : larger. A good deal
was done in the way of buying short W neat
for September and reselling it for December.
The Liverpool market responded but feebly to
the previous day's rise here. The Continental
markets were unchanged, except for August
delivery at Paris, where one of the periodical
French corners was in progress. . Demand from
the seaboard i for shipping Jots was not very
brisk, and was principally' for September de- j
livery. The market ruled very heavy near the
end, but rallied a. fraction Just as the bell was .
; tapping. September and December closed %@ |
%c lower each on the day.
Little business was done in Corn for export,
but the tone - was heavy for an hour or so.
during which It was strengthened by the early j
bullishness of Wheat. September closed Vie
lower.
Trade in Oats was only moderately active and ;
pretty well scattered. There was some inquiry |
from the seaboard for : heavy grain, but the |
bids* were somewhat out of line. September j
closed unchanged to %c higher.
Provisions were- affected in a small way by ;

DRIED FRUITS IN THE EAST.
NEW YORK, Aug. 26.â The, Journal of Com
merce says: The spot stock of California dried
fruits carried over from last year in Icehouse
has. it Is reported, been nearly absorbed by
the current wants of consumption, and at the
present time the spot supply, particularly kof
apricots and peaches, Is said to be much
smaller than usual at this season. Taken in
connection with reports from the coast that the
output this year has been one of the lightest
on record,' the feeling Is very firm and the
tendency of prices Is upward. The , apricot
crop â¢ this season was, as is now generally
known, exceedingly short, and the fruit for
the most part was of small size. The export
demand has taken most of the stock, leaving
i little for home wartfs. The shortage in peaches
i has caused a strong feeling in that article and
prices are decidedly higher for both spot and
to arrive There Is a considerably stronger
feeling in the market for California prunes.
Recent sales of .California irolt were made for
I early forward shipment at .3VJO34C f. o.jb.,
1 but to-day 314 c <"â¢ â Â°-â¢ b. seemed to bo the Inside
price for shipment and holders appeared \ to be
indifferent sellers at that figure.

. The circular of Jacob Wollner says: "Our I
market is still very dull and there Is very little
selling, although prices are well maintained.
Eastern seaboard markets â  are reported in the
same condition, as the mills can place out
very little goods, and so are shutting down
or running on short time. - Prices . are well
maintained throughout this dull spell, which j
has lasted for nearly ten months. Statistically i
wool Is Ftrong. The only thing Is to await a ;
demand for goods which is expected from day j
to day, week to week, and month to month.
When it will come It Is hard to foretell, but
when It does come the dealers will have to
place orders at the mills and the mills will
have to come into the market and buy wool,
so a demand may . spring up at almost any
time. Prices are nominally unchanged In this
market and In the East."

Harrison's circular says: "The following
deliveries of coal have been made this week,
viz : Throe from Washington, with 7550 tons;
three from British Columbia, 8363 tons; three
from Oregon, 1150 tons; seven from Australia,
18,454 tons; one from Swansea, 2917 tons; total,
38,440 tons. So long as coal comes to hand as
freely as it has been doing recently, consumers
will have no cause for complaint, as all un
filled contracts are now being cared for. Some
of . our largest consumers have been very for
tunate in making low-priced purchases several
months ago. which are now coming to hand;
their fuel will cost them much more for the
I next six to eight months at least. This is ab-
I solutely assured, as all the coal freight from
I Australia procurable into the first three months
I of 1599 has been already engaged at full rates;
I besides, the Colonial mail Just at hand states
pretty positively there will be an advance of
fully one shilling per ton on all Newcastle
products after January next. This will be good
news to our Coast colliery owners, as they regu
late their scale of prices by the delivery cost
of Australian. Coal freights from English ports
t are low enough (15s from Swansea), but their
! cargoes are unprocurable pro tern as the coal
I hewers still hold out for . a higher scale of
wages. The .British Government, with' Its
usual foresight, is making large contracts for
delivery of American coal at its many naval
stations. This should prove an object lesson
to coal operators in England and Wales."

SUMNER'S RABID LANGUAGE
M V J. : KELLER REPLIES AND IS
RATHER SARCASTIC.
The. Coming Change of Congressmen
Has Brought Forward the
â¢ . " '. Much-Debated Warm
. " â¢ â¢ Question Again.
;'. .' Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Aug. 26.
. Ex-Congressman Charles A. Sumoer,
â who has published certain letters regard
ing the status of Oakland tidal canal
matters, has made several statements
Which;' are emphatically contradicted by
Oaklanders. Some time ago there ap
peared a circular entitled "'The Oakland
Tidal. Canalâ Letter No. 9," but no copies
of it could be obtained by Oaklanders, and
It- was understood that the letter was not
â for k>cal circulation.
.'Recently several copies of it have been
circulated and as there Is to be a new
Congressman sent from this district next
November the matter has become one of
great interest. In his letter Mr. Suniner
says: ' â¢
' That 'this revival of attention to the report of
"the three distinguished engineers who in 1874
â¢ reported so favorably and earnestly about a
'.harbor in San Antonio Creekâ which Oak
land was then said to : be situatedâ been
â¢exasperating to Mr. Huntlngton and many, of
â¢ â¢his flunkeys (especially to his lobbyists and
bribers who sojourn or sleep in the city of Oak
land) is not to be wondered at by the Intel
. llgent citizen in this locality. These despicable
"creatures have long been engaged in the
-â¢â¢business" of whisperingâ (only of late talking
loudly In the strain to be Indicated)â the
â¢'ridiculous idea" of any such thing as a "har
bor east of Broadway !'" It is indeed very ag-
g ravating to them to be confronted with â  the
' -explicit language of "The Board of Officers
constituted by fptrcial orders No. 32. headquar
ters corps of engineers, Washington. D. C. Maroh
24, 1873." For now all my readers have seen for
themselves that it is not true that the origi
nal scheme was merely for the opening of a
â¢ harbor cr.annel from deep water in the Bay of
I San Francisco to that point on San Antonio
i Creek which Is marked as the "foot of Broad
way. in Oakland." The engineers reported that
they were directed to make an' "examination
and survey and plan of - harbor for San An
tonio Creek, California." and their words and
actions showed that they never dreamed that
they were to : be confined to so much of the
creek as' was measured from deep water at
its mouth in San Francisco Bay to the Oak
land Broadway frontage. The most of my
. readers have, doubtless, by this time become
fully of the opinion that the best interests of
all" of the people of Oakland properâ all who
are not servitors or hirelings of the Infamous
â¢ Huntlngtonâ are to be most thoroughly pro
moted by the completion of the plan originally
submitted by Colonels Stewart and Alexander,
â¢ and Major Mendel!, In 1874. That "plan" had
Its "consummation" in the Tidal Canal. On
this particular construction they prided them
selves. This was their own suggestion; brought
forth by their own professional observation
and judgment. There was no hint to. them
about tilts feature in the errand project, save
what -.; -are herself pave to so thoughtful and
candid a. board of. officers. They sold: "For
tunately, such a pian Is almost provided by
nature." If the neck of land to be cut through
had been many times as wide as It is. they
would have suggested and urged the excavat
ing. That Is what they mean or imply, when
they use the language quoted above. But . for
tunately the distance is not great, and the cost .
of digging the canal will not be relatively :
large. . : :
Unfortunately, most unfortunately, it was
subsequently discovered that the "Interests" of
â¢ the railroad monopoly were In conflict with the
carrying out of this "plan" which the engi
â  neers joyfully .exclaimed about, as "almost
provided by nature.
Now this plan fully consummated would
make a harbor of the entire of San Antonio
=â¢ Creekâ "a fine, land-locked harbor." Hunting
ton and his henchmen don't want that. Oh,
no. And furthermore, they have been saying
that no such thing was ever contemplated. I
"The Idea! How absurd!" Only a ship chan
nel to Broadway; that's all. "The Tidal
Canal to be a Ship Canal!" Why, *\jch emi
nently worthy citizens as Steve Gage and Mr.
Keller (whose advertisement may be seen on '
the ticket holders given to | Southern Pacific
. Railroad commuters), are nearly choked with
. laughter over the "ridiculousness", of the sug
gestion.
' â¢ Vice-President M. J. Keller of the Oak
land Board of Trade, who has taken a ;
-leading parr in harbor matters for sev- ;
e.raJ years, %as made the following reply
. to Mr; Sumner:
â¢Mr. Sumner Is certainly on the
wrong, track as to the cause of the late
'controversy about the Oakland harbor.
I'TcjVow the railroad company has been
charged at times with a desire to im
pede ..all work on Oakland harbor:
charged with having a preference for
first cutting the canal and improving
â¢ East Oakland basin before completing
the portion west of Webster street.
' .The wishes and preferences of that
company. if they had any. were never
ce.ns.iclered by the Oakland Board of Trade
â when' they proceeded through their com
mittee to undo the schemes of Dr. Mc-
Eean.
â¢It was this gentleman who, perhaps at
the request of the railroad company, In
Order to delay the use of the harbor In
definitely, sent a petition to the Secre
tary of War, signed by the two Callfor
'nla Senators, by Congressman Hilborn
and .by four others from this State, ask
ing that all money then available, and
to become available, be expended In cut
ting the canal and dredging East Oak- â 
Jand basin until completed. This action
is what brought on the controversy.
If any Interest desired to delay the use
of the harbor would it not, be best
served â by securing a compliance with
the doctor's petition?
â¢ As a' matter of fact, the Oakland com
mittee never opposed the cutting of
the â¢ canal ; the Board of Trade never
Opposed it: the people of Oakland
never opposed this work, and . the
declarations of Mr. Metcalf In his
campaign speech In Alameda, previous
to the late primary, " ought to be suffi
cient evidence... -- *
. This rasping on a question settled by
official acts of the cities of Oakland
and Alamedaâ settled by the signatures
of the Alameda representatives, arid . In- :
dorsed by the people of Alameda In pub
lic ; meetingâ would seem to be for po
litical effect. Why don't the gentlemen
of the committee come out in the open
rather than encourage this bushwhack-"
In*, if they still think they yielded their
consent and their signatures adversely
to the interests of their city?

William Murphy Prob
ably Fatally Injured.
CHRIS BUCKLEY'S COACHMAN
HIT BY A CAB 2000 FEET UN
DER GROUND.
A Strike Among Japanese Coal Pick
ers That Results in Giving
Work to Fifty White
Men.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Aug. 26.
"William Murphy, who has the distinc
tion of having been Chris. Buckley's
coachman for years, until the well-known^
politician left for the East a month or two
ago, met with an accident at the Tesla
coal mines to-day that will probably cost
him his life.
The accident occurred about 2000 feet
under ground in the tunnel at the mines
this afternoon. Murphy was in the nar
row tunnel when a loaded coal car came
rumbling alotig the narrow track of tho
tunnel. The passage way was too small
; for Murphy to avoid the car and he was
, crushed against the side of the tunnel.
[ He was picked up unconscious and car
1 rled out to one of the small houses near
: by, where the coal mine physician attend
ed him. Several ribs were broken and it
; is feared that he sustained Internal in
j juries that may prove fatal.
The injured man is a great favorite
with all the men in and about the mines,
and nothing was left undone to alleviate
his sufferings.
A similar accident occurred last Thurs
day, when Ed. Burks was run Into by a
coal car in the same tunnel and sustained
a broken arm and other injuries about the
shoulders and back.
There has been considerable excitement
at the mines the past few days. Recently
fifty Japanese were put to work separat
ing coal. Last Tuesday they managed to
get a lot of rocks mixed with the coal and
the euperintendent fined them $60 because
of their incompetency. They declined to
pay on the advice of M. Oto, their law
yer, and quit work.
Fifty Chinese were immediately given
their places, but those also q"uit yesterday
to avoid trouble and the management is
now letting the work to white labor.
RED CROSS LADIES
APPEALING FOR AID
THEIR NOBLE EFFORTS FOR
DISABLED SOLDIERS.
Proposition to Arrange for a Tempo
rary Convalescent Home in Oak
land to Meet All Pres
ent Cases.
OAKLAND. Aug. 26.â The idea of estab
lishing? a convalescent home at the Pre
sidio originated with the Oakland: Red
Cross Society, through whom $600 has
been contributed; but while this work is
being pushed, the society Is not unmind
ful of the necessity for doing something
for the men now convalescent.
To meet the present needs a committee, j
consisting of Mrs. F. G. Ginn. Mrs. O. F. I
Long, Dr. Myra Knox, Mrs. John Bake- j
well and Mrs. G. W. Bunnell, met this j
morning to formulate pians for the main- |
tenance of a convalescent soldiers' home |
on this side of the bay.^
The committee proposes to secure a
large unfurnished house in the suburbs
Of Oakland, which will be put into con
dition to /receive such patients as would
in most cases die before the home in San ;
Francisco can be ready for use. To meet
these requirements the ladies make an
appeal to the public for donations of old
furniture, mattresses, bedding, small
rugs, etc., all of which will help to make
a soldiers' home comfortable. Thus far
the Oakland ladies have been meeting
every emergency nobly. Only last night
Mrs. Veltch converted her attic into a
hospital for ten sick boys, for whom she
ia caring. The number of typhoid pa- i
tients is large at present.
THE "FRESHIES" WHIP
THE SOPHOMORES
THE FACULTY'S PROHIBITION
WAS OPENLY DISREGARDED.
Noses Were Smashed and Heads
Bruised on the Campus of the
State Universityâ A Hot
. Fracas.
BERKELEY, Aug. 26.â 1n spite of the
faculty's prohibition last year ag-ainst
rushing of any kind, the freshman and
sophomore classes In the University of
California, clashed this evening upon the
campus, and struggled for over half an
hour to tie each other up. The tussle
was quite one-sided from the start, the
sophomores having less than forty men to
stand off 100 of their opponents. They
fought valiantly for a while, but over
whelming numbers soon gained the upper
hand.
The upper classmen finally lay piled
in a heap, bound hand and foot, and gasp
ing for breath.
At 4 o'clock the members of the enter-
Ing class assembled in Stiles Hall for the
purpose of electing officers. Their oppo
nents did their best to break up the meet
ing. They rattled the doors, banged the
windows, and made it lively for any
freshman who happened to stray from
his comrades. Within the freshman
meeting Quickly resolved itself into a
board of strategy. Several Juniors were
tTlspatched for bale-rope and the class
yell sounded defiance.
Meanwhile the "Sophs" had taken up
thMr position by the backstop of the foot
ball field. Here they lined up and pre
pared for battle. The Freshies got ready
for the fray, and forming six deep, start
ed on the run, yelling and hooting, toward
their opponents. In a few minutes it was
clear that the sophomores had no chance.
They were easily overpowered and soon
ceased to Btruggle. The contest was
marfced by a very serious accident. One
student was severely kicked in the head,
and several noses stand in need of re
pair. _

HE GUESSED AT THE
JUDGE'S POLITICS
RECORDER ST. SURE RELEASES
A MAN WHO KNEW NOT GAGE.
The Prisoner, However, Declared He
Had Once Been Out With the
Los Angeles Mayor.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Aug. 26.
Recorder St. Sure, the Democratic Judge
of Alameda, broke through his usual rule
this morning and did a little politics. He
had before him a stranger from the city
whence halls the Republican nominee for
Governor. The unlucky man was Leo
Allbritton, and he was charged with being
plainly drunk.
Democratic Judge St. Sure questioned
the prisoner, being somewhat doubtful as
to his story that he had come from Los
Angeles along a hard road and had only
been drunk twice in his life.
"You know Mayor Snyder in Los An
geles?" asked the Judge.
"I do, well, your Honor," Paid the Dris
oner. "The only other time I was ever
drunk in my life was on an occasion when
I went out with Mayor Snyder. We are
great friends."
"Do you know Henry T. Gage of Los
Angeles?" asked St. Sure.
"Gage? Gage? Never heard of him in
my life, your Honor."
"The prisoner is discharged, said the
Recorder.
As Allbritton passed out of the court
room he said to a bystander, "I was sure
I knew that ffuy'e politics."

BIMETALLIC CLUB.
Fusion Nominee Jones Tells of His
Difficulties.
ALAMEDA, Aug. 26.â The Bimetallic
Club held a meeting last evening which
was well attended. The members of the
organization who took part in the Demo
cratic convention at Sacramento told of
their experience there and the club in
dorsed the ticket that was nominated.
John Aubrey Jones, the fusion candi
date for Congress, then addressed the
gathering and talked for some time about
his chances of defeating his opponent.
He said that he realized that there were
big odds against him, there being a Re
publican majority of 3500 to overcome.
Besides this he was without money to
make the fight, while his opponent had
unlimited capital at his command. Nev
ertheless he believed that he had the
people with him and that he would win
the fight. Anyhow he intended to do hl3
best to "defeat the combined cohorts of
capital and corporations."
Chinese in Trouble.
ALAMEDA, Aug. 26.â For several days
past the Chinese Inhabitants of Alameda
have been engaged in the annual duty of
driving the evil spirits out of the city.
Their ceremonies had progressed favor
ably and everything was propitious for
the permanent eviction of the devil and
his satelites, when in a moment's lack
of watchfulness one of the tapers that
was kept burning night and day before
the great Joss in some way communicated
its blaze to the deity and in a few min
utes ho was reduced to ashes. The Chi
nese, of couree, firmly believe that it was
the devil "himself who caused the flre,
and they will go over the ceremonies
again as soon as a new joss can be se
cured- for they declare that it is more
than ?ver incumbent upon them to carry
out the process.
Unlucky Sailing Party.
ALAMEDA, Aug. 26.â Dr. VC. M. Pond
and the two young ladies who were upset
In the bay last night while sailing in the
yacht Klondike by the carelessness of
the young man who had charge of the
boat' were all right to-day. They were
inexpressibly thankful over their nar
row escape from death, as they would
certainly have been drowned had not the
doctor closed the cabin door and fas
tened It securely just before the yacht
went over, thereby causing the vessel to
be buoyed up by the air Inclosed in the
cabin. Had this not been done the vessel
would surely have sunk at once, and all
would probably have been drowned.
Secretly Married.
ALAMEDA, Aug. 26.â Albert C. Wyber
and Miss Frances Mandler were married
on Wednesday evening at the Presby

The wedding was without the knowledge
of the bride's parents. A marriage license
was obtained on the day mentioned, and
when asked by a reporter when the wed
ding was to take place, the young
womnn and her parents denied all knowl
edge of it. Nevertheless it took place
that evening without Mr. and Mrs. Man
dler participating or knowing of it.

CRIMINAL MALPRACTICE.
The Sad Ending of a Young Mother.
Identity of the Guilty Party
Unknown.
OAKLAND, Aug. 26.â A Coroner's jury

OAKLAND LICENSES.
Merchants Protest but the Objection
able Ordinance Passes.
OAKLAND, Aug. 26.â The Ordinance
and Judiciary Committee of the City j
Council held an Interesting session this !
evening, and after hearing many objec- i
tions against the new business license
ordinance, which was recently intro
duced by Councilman Rowe, recom
mended its passage.
Mr. Walker of the Merchants' Ex
change, M. J. Keller of the Board of
Trade, Sol Kahn and others were very
emphatic in their protest against this ac
tion.
They regard the ordinance as an injus
tice and claimed that the merchants are
already overtaxed. Councilman Rowe
also said *ie believed the merchants are
handicapped by San Francisco merchants
and he moved that the committee recom
mend that the passage of the ordinance
be postponed Indefinitely, but this was
lost. Councilman Henneberry then moved
the recommendation for passage which
was carried.
An ordinance prohibiting peddlers ring
ing the bells or otherwise bothering resi
dents whose doora are placarded. "No
peddlers." was recommended for adoption.
H was also decided that all bitumlnized
streets be swept by machine at night, and
in addition thai Washington street and
Broadway be swept by four men during
the day time. It was also recommended
that the offer of deeds made by the
Peralta Heights Improvement Club for
lands between the Eighth-street bridga
and Twelfth-street damâ tnis to be filled
in with mud dredged from Lake Merrtttâ
be accepted. The land so filled in is to
be utilized for park purposes when the
Council can see its way clear to meet such
expense.
Philosophy Was the Theme of James.
BERKELEY, Aug. 26.â Professor Wil
liam James of Harvard University de
livered the annual lecture under the aus
pices of the Philosophical Union, Uni
versity of California, at Harmon gym
nasium to-night. A large college audience
listened to the lecture.
Profesor James spoke for over an hour
on the "Philosophy of Practicallsm." In
the course of his remarks he took occa
sion to score dogmatic theology and the
school of German philosophers. "The
philosophy of practicalism," he said,
"judges every thought. It weighs Its
worth and significance by its consequence
upon exteriors. Two apparently opposing
ideas are familiar, haying no appreciable
difference in their effect upon life.
"Materialism and theism and th.Hr re
lated discussions, judged in this light,
avoiding altogether a retrospective atti
tude, considers them prospectively and
asks what human conduct they enjoin
and what human effort they inspire. It
casts aside dogmatic theology as a set of
dictionary adjectives, vaguely and ab
stractedly used, usurping the place of vi
tal religion.
"Belief 'and conduct are inseparable.
Their association is the only sane guide
to philosophyâ a principle which underlies
the whole attitude of English philosophy
and opposed to the air castle work of the
German school, and only as beliefs uphold
the moral order of the world. According
to our inner hope and trust can practi
calism, which strongly indorses tneistic
ideas, regard them as worthy of consid
eration?^

Laitra. I bought my first supply of Ripans Tabules
more out of curiosity than anything else,
and was very much surprised at the good
results which followed their use. I had
often seen them advertised, but being a little
prejudiced against patent medicines I thought
they would do me no good. In future I
never want to be without them. I had been
troubled with indigestion and dyspepsia for
& long time, and although I tried many kinda
of medicine, I never found anything really
to do me much good until I tried Ripans
Tabulea

The torpedo boat destroyer Farragut.
recently launched at the Union Iron
Works, gives promise of being the only
Jioodoo ship ever launched from the noted
Shipyard at the Potrero. In keeping with
hor record since- she slipped gracefully Into
the waters of the bay, she is again laid
up for repairs.
This time her injuries are so serious as
to preclude the possibility of her official
trial for many weeks to come. Seafar
ing mon have looked askance at her trim
lines ever since the night on which she
tss launched. To Miss Elizabeth Aphe,
a niece 01 Admiral Farragut. was dele
gated the honor of christening the speedi
est boat in all the American navy. When
the fateful moment arrived for the break-
ing of the bottle of i
wine upon the ship's I
bow there was a !
hitchâ the bottle did j
not yield up its \
sparkling contents. :
A man standing high :
up on the deck of j
the boat grasped tho [

silken ribbons by \
which the bottle was
suspended and per
formed the neces
sary duty.
There was much J
ominous head shak- |
ing at tho time and i

the men in charge of her did not, appar
ently, allow sufficient space in which to
bring: her to a fuii stop.

substance made havoc with its deiicatfl

The machinery could be stopped, had also
cracked the cylinder.
The piston rod wus repaired at the yard, I
but th*=- cylinder must be replaced in tho I
East, whence it came. The piston
rod, like every nut and bolt of the ma
chinery, is hollowed out, to the end that
wHght might be saved. Everything
about the boat has been designed to pro- I
duce the extreme speed of which she Is
possessed.
The most rigid investigation has been
instituted by Superintendent John T.
Scott and others in authority at the
works in order to fix if possible the re- I
sponsibility for the injury to tne Farra- I
gut It has not been determined, as yet,
at what perioiMhe bolt found lodgment
in the cylinder. TBl_fc-offleial.s scoff at the
Idea that the bolt was placed there by
some malicious person. The explanation
offered is that it fell into the cylinder
when the engines were being assemoled
originally and gradually worked its way
to the place where it wrought so much
damage.
STRUCK BY A CARRIAGE.
Mrs. Henrietta Arnold Knocked
Down and Slightly Injured at
Fourth and Market.
Mrs. Henrietta Arnold, residing at the
Wilson House, 775 Mission street, was
knocked do-vn by a team while crossing
Market street at the intersection of
Fourth and Stockton, yesterday after
noon, and escaped with a few
Insignificant bruises and a shock to
her nervous system that may confine her
to her bed for a day or two. According:
to Policeman Farley, who was on duty
st the crossing, quite a number of ve
hicles, among them the private carriage
of John D. Spreckels, driven by hla
coachman, and containing Mr. Spreckels'
two daughters, approached the spot at
the same time. Farley had piloted some
ladies across the street when he heard
a shout and turned to see Mrs. Arnold
lying on the pavement almost beside him
and alongside the Spreckels carriage.
Mrs. Arnold had evidently attempted to
follow the officer across the street and
was struck by the whlffletree. throwing
her to the ground. The officer assisted
her to the drug store at the cornnr of
Market and Stockton streets, where Dr.
J. A. Nelson made an examination, and
finding she was not seriously injured,
Bummoned a carriage and removed her to
Her lodging-
Mr. Spreckels was notified of the acci
dent, and at once sent Dr. Winterberg to
attend to Mrs. Arnold. The two phy
sicians made a careful examination and
found that her injuries were trivial, the
most painful being a bruised toe, caused
by one of the horses stepping on It. One
of Mrs. Arnold's fingers was also bruised.
her right shoulder sprained and the sklK
scraped from her knees when she fell.
As sho was Quite hysterical she was
placed in bed and advised to remain there
until she recovered her composure.
Officer Farley said the team was being
flriven at an ordinary gait and no blame
could be attached to the driver, as It
was palpably an accident. The coach
man made a statement of the affair to
the officer and was allowed to proceed
without detention. The scene of the ac
cident is one of the most dangerous cross-
Ings in town.
Teachers' Aid Society.
The Tc-aohers" Mutual Aid Society held
its semi-annual meeting yesterday after
noon at Union square Hall. There was a
large attendance. The reports of the
officers showed the society to be in a
flourishing condition.
The new board of directors was duly In
stalled, and was as follows: Miss Hackett of

PASSING OF
ARTHUR WHITE
Popular Young Turfman
Dies in St. Louis.
STARTER CALDWELL ROASTED
JOCKEY BURNS SIGNED TOO
MANY CONTRACTS.
Stake Races That Attract and the
Reverse â What Turfmen Ex
pected and What They Are
Going to Receive.
Intelligence has Just been received that
Arthur White died In St. Louis last Fri
day. Mr. White was but 26 years of age,
but for all that was one of the best-known
turfmen in the West. He was a member
of the well-known racing firm of Whfte
& Clark, and came to California about
four years ago, bringing Whitestone,
Clara White and many others to this
coast. They had a fair measure of suc
cess. Later they owned Morven, Com
mission, 11m Murphy and other well
known turf performers. Arthur Wh.te
first came into public notice in 1892, whoa
at Washington Park, Chicago, he cleaned
up $36,000 on Carlsbad's win of the Ameri
can derby. He was then but 20 years of
age. With this money he purchased, in
partnership with "Stoney" Clark, a large
siring of racehorses, and also went Into
the bookmaking- business. During the
past two years the firm' has b<*en terribly
down in its luck, and not long since Clark
took the horses and raced them in Mon- j
tana, where they now are. Mr. White'a [
death was caused by consumption, whicn
began to assert itself about two years |
ag-o. He went to San Antonio, Texas, a
year ago to recuperate. The trip did him I
a world of good, but with a return of j
health came a lack of care for himself,
with the result that the popular young >
St. Lou's turfman passed away at the j
home of his parents. His legion of friends
throughout America will greatly regret
his early taking off.
The Chicago papers are a unit in "roast
ing" Starter Caldwell and in praising W.
F. Bruen, who did the starting the first :
week of the Hawthorne meeting. The re- I
suit will probably be the retirement of
the veteran to the home of the "used-to
be's." Bruen is= evidently an "iser."
Jockey Tommy Burns oids fair to cause
a lot of trouble for the Turf Congress
folks. The signature of his parents is
attached to one contract too many for the i
seasons of 1599 and 190 C One is to a con- j
tract with Thomas Hums of 111
nois, the other to one with John j
W. Schorr & Son of Memphis, j
renn. It was Hums who "de- j
veloped" the now famous rider. Under j
that contract Tommy is to receive but I
12500 a year; under the Schorr contract ]
JSOOO per season as a retainer. Burns is |
inly IT years or" age, and cannot write his i
jwh name; but it seems his Canadian I
parents write altogether too muchâ at
least as far as signatures on riding con
tracts are concerned. Just who will eet
Burns' services is enigmatical, but the
boy declares he will never throw a Wg j
liver another horse for Hums, however
the Turf Congress law unravelers may
decide.
The California Jockey Club managers
could get together and dish up a few
new stakes and erase a number from
their stake books. The ones just an
nounced are so old and worn that one
would think the type had been electroed
and the club did not want to throw
away the plat*--.. The big stakesâ those i
worth over $20wâ are all right, but those I
worth any less are not going to have [
any more drawing power on turfmen now I
on the other side of the Bookies than a |
bread-and-milk poultice on a mule's sore j
3hin. It was announced here last sum
mer that $1000 and $1200 races, dignified j
with the name "stake." were things of j
the pastâ an unpleasant memory merely, i
Yet Just thirteen of these are offered, i
In not one of these stakes mentioned is !
the winner's share over $1000. and one
race vvorth.soooo is ten times as good when j
Irawing cards are desired as these measly
affairs designated "stakes." And then,
too, the conditions in most of these events
Will not suit the up-to-date turfmen of
the present. Those now on the Eastern .
side of the ridge will nstst on the con- i
aitlons reading "$ added." and not "a
sufficient sum will bo added to make the
stake worth $ ." They will not stand
for "guaranteed stakes" any longer, I
for club members seldom h;:vr- to go down [
Into their jeans to make good aa much as I
they would have to in an ordinary sell- j
ing" race. In short, the only kind of
stake worth offering is one worth from
$2000 to $20,000, for cheap affalrr, don't
have aa many starters in them by half aa
a race for the common selling platers,
and are, therefore, not quite as interest
ing. It was declared here last summer
that the number of stakes were to be
cut down and those given would b? worth
any turfman's while, but it seems tho
change from last season is bo slight it
would take a powerful microscope to dis
cern it. __________ ______

WILL CARE FOR SICK SOLDIERS.
Laden with medical supplies, recruits and hospital nurses, the Seandla
will steam from this port to-day, bound for Honolulu and Manila. On her
return from the latter port she will have on board the
soldiers sick and wounded, who will be given every
attention by the wearers of the Red Cross and the
surgeons in charge. The local society has been pre
paring delicacies and necessaries for the returning
heroes, and its representatives will see that the arti
cles are dealt out with a lavish hand.
Dr. Z. T. Malaby of the army will assume charge of
the medical department of the converted transport,
and will see that every comfort i.s given tfce patients.
Although a young man, Dr. Malaby has had a wide
and varied experience. He was house surpeon <>f
Bellevue Hospital, New York, for two years, and while
there had occasion to treat cases of every kind. Im
mediately on the outbreak of the war he tendered his
services to the War Department, and they were ac
cepted. He was given the rank of first lieutenant, and
was attached to the medical staff of the army.
and at frpquent intervals the New \ork
band, stationed at the bow of the steam
er played patriotic airs. The dock was
thronged with visitors and friends or the
departing soldiers. As usual the Red
Cross ladles were on hand to supply the
men with lunches. It was at a late hour
last night? that the Scandia pulled out
Into the stream. .
The steamer, now owned by the Govern
ment, formerly belonged to the Ham
burg-Amorlcan* Packet line. She is about
aa large as the Arizona, has power: ul
engines, is quite a speedy boat and Â»s
wrll adapted fcr a hospital ship, for
which she is to bo used after reaching
Manila. Captain N. T. Messer, who
brought her to this port, has been re
tained In charge of the vessel.
Orders were received from the \\ ar De
partment at militury headquarters yes
terday for ..10 Arizona, now at Honolulu,
to leave her troops at that port and pro
ceed to Manila. The orders will be car
ried to Honolulu by the Scandia.
SEVENTH CALIFORNIA.
Surgeon Choate Makes a State
ment of the Typhoid
Fever Cases.
Major Choate, surgeon of the Seventh
California Regimen', gives the following
history of the typhoid fever patients of
the command:
To the Editorâ ln regard to the statement
relative to the existence of typhoid fever In
the Kevt-nth California Regiment, I will state
that our regiment was sent to Camp Merritt
on May 23. On June 1 two cases of typhoid
fever developed, viz: Lieutenant Hates and
Private Wood. These were tr-nst erred to the
French Hospital. On June 25 Lieutenant
Greenleaf and Private Tyson were taken with
typhoid and w<?re Transferred to the Marine
Hospital. Two more cases developed during
June, anl since then typhoid patients have
come in at the rate of about one a week until
August 12. since which time they have devel
oped at the rate of about two per day. During
a part of this time malarial fever has also
been very prevalent, and oftentimes It has re
quired several days' observation to determine
whether a patient was afflicted with typhoid
or malarial fever. As soon as typhoid has
been diagnosed the patients have been pent
to either the Division Field Hospital or to one
of the other hospitals, which have so gener
ously offered to care for the sick soldiers.
There were not sixteen cases sent to the
Division Field Hospital on August 24, with a
diagnosis of typhoid fever, as has been stated.
Four of the thirty cases sent were diajrnosed
as typhoid fever, eight more were mariced ty
phoid fever followed by a question mark. show-
Ing that they were still under observation and
diagnosis not certain; two or three malarial
fever; the others for sickness of other kinds.
Eleven of the fever patients were received into
the hocpltal within the three-day limit de
scribed by orders from headquarters.
The reason why so many had accumulatetfnn
the Regimental Horpltal was that the Divis
ion Field Hospital notified W about August 15
not to send any more patients than was ab
solutely necessary, as they were overcrowded
and forced to put the sick in tents.
The car.es of typhoid developed almost entirely
In one section of the camp, the reason for which
was shown the day before we moved. August
23. when a mass of filthy refuse of various
kinds was uncovered while the men were exca
vating for new sinks. This refuse had evi
dently been buried by the former occupants of
the tract.
There has been no reason for, nor attempt
at, concealment of the unsanitary and un
healthy conditions of the camp, ac our morn-
Ing reports from the first day In Camp Merritt
until the present time will show.
In regard to the wgiment remaining at
Camp Merritt. It is to be borne in mind that
since the order to move to the Presidio some
four weeks ago was revoked by Maio;- General
Merriam because It hnd been decided to sund
the regiment to Manila on the Arizona or the
Scandia. It has remained there In constnnt ex
pectation of soon being ordered aboard ship,
and for this reason I have not personally urged
our removal. J. J. CHOATE.

YOUNG'S MISTAKES.
Blames the Officers of the 2Oth
Kansas for His Conviction
of Embezzlement.
The statement of Quartermaster Ser
geant Jnmes A. Young of the Twentieth
Kansas Regiment, who was sentenced to
one year in the penitentiary at Leaven
worth for the embezzlement of commis
sary stores, treated some little excite
ment yesterday in the regiment of which
he was a member.
The facts are these, as given out by the
quartermaster: Young sold In an open
and above board manner $109 SO worth of
commissary stores and invested the mon
ey in tobacco. Part of this amount was
taken out in trade for tobacco. This to
bacco Young sold to the men. companies
.and officers of the regiment, and in but
one case did he receive any pay, but
charged it up against the different par- I
ties. All the money he received gp cash |
he accounted for. An officer of tne regi
ment, who was upon the court that tried
Young, said yesterday that if he had J
been tried In a civil court he would have
been quickly acquitted. Young's ac- i
counts show that some of the commis- \
sioned officers of the regiment borrowed
money of him, which they have not yet ;
returned.
Young declares that he Is not guilty,
because if he violated any military law
it was through ignorance, and he never
appropriated a cent of the money to his
own use. It appears that he is not cul- ;
pable of any intentional embezzlement. â 
as he has not been paid the money that
he was charged with embezzling. Young ;
states that he has friends at home who
will present his case direct to Secretary
Alger.and that he will soon be out of the j
penitentiary. General Miller says that
any ameliorating circumstances in the I
case will be forwarded by him to the Ad- |
jutant General at Washington.
THE DIVISION HOSPITAL.
Major Mathews Will Have
Thirty Trained Nurses at
Work Next Monday.
Major Matthews, in charge of the Di
vision Hospital, stated yesterday that fif
teen of the trained female nurses com
menced work yesterday, and that he
hoped by Monday to have thirty, the en
tire number contracted for by the Gov
ernment, at work. He anticipates no in
convenience because of the number of
stewards that left .the hospital yesterday
to go to Manila, and declares that by the
first of the week he will have the big hos
pital force in better working order than
It has been heretofore. Regarding tho
report that he will be called upon to
make in relation to the typhoid fever
cases from the Seventh California Regi
ment Major Matthews said: "I will hand
in my report to General Miller to-day
but I am not prepared to say what it will
be. However, I do want to say that there
Is no epidemic of typhoid fever, and I
regret the sensational reports published
regarding it. The percentage of actual
fever patients is small. The investiga
tion is not called for because of the num
ber of cases, but because of the offense
in not notifying the proper authorities.
As far as that goes, one case of fever in
the regiment and that not reported would
cajl for the same investigation. At pres
ent I am not prepared to say who is to
blame, if any one.
BOARD OF SURVEY.
To Examine Chartered Trans
ports With a View of Return-
ing Them to The Owners.
Upon the application of Colonel Long,
depot quartermaster, a board of survey,
consisting of Captain Edwin P. Pendle-
ton. Twenty-third Infantry. Captain Eu
gene T. Wilson, Volunteer Signal Corps,
and First Lieutenant John O'Shea,,
Fourth Cavalry, nas been appointed to
meet from time to time, as may be Indi
cated by the depot quartermaster, to act
conjointly with representatives of owners
of steamships chartered by the United
States as Government transports in con
nection with the removal fror.i such ves
sels of all property of th^ United States
that the Government has placed upon
these transports as fittings, and recom
mend what disposition shall be made of
the same. If any repairs are necessary
to place these vessels in the same condi
tion as when chartered as transports, the
board will determine the amount neces
sary to refit the vessels. The board will,
in addition, determine such various in
cidental questions which may arise pond
ing return of the chartered transports
BOW no longer needed by the Government
to their owners, and of those transports
which return to this port and leave on
a second or other voyage under the or
ders of the Government. The board will
fix responsibility and recommend the dis
position of property to the best interests
of the service.

ment at Recreation Park, Sixteenth and

War Incidents.
Lieutenant Allen Garwood "Wright of
the Fourteenth United States Infantry
sailed on the steamer Arizona on the
21st. Yesterday's Call r-aid he was to
sail on the Scandla, which, of course. Is a
mistake. If. all went well with the Arizona
he is now at Honolulu, being temporarily
attached to the Third Battalion of the
Eighteenth Infantry- The Fourteenth
Infantry it at Manila, and Lieutenant
Wright has uad no opportunity of joining
It since receiving his commission, as no
troopships have left San Francisco for
that port.
Colonel Suter, Captain Sedgwick and
Lieutenant Pratt have been appointed by
the War Department as a board to sur
vey a route for the laying of submarine
cables between the various points of the
San Francisco hari>or defenses.
Camp Merrltt 14 a thing of the past.
The Third Battalion of the Twenty-third
Infantry, with the Oregon recruits at
tached, moved from the pest hole yester
day morning over to the Presidio, where
they went into camp upon the site for
merly occupied by the battalion of en
gineers.
Private Charles J. Lynch, Company K.
First Washington Regiment, died at the
post hospital at 12 o'clock Thursday
night, of injuries received By falling
down the stairs In his quarters.
Captain \V. H. McKitirlck, son-in-law
of General Shafter, was at the Presidio
yesterday. He states that for the present
and until all of the circumstances are
fully known that the public should re
frain from censuring Shafter. The gen
eral will probably reach this coast in
about two weeks. Captain McKlttrick is
the officer who raised the flag over San
tiago.
The court rrartiai now trying the cases
o_ the Boidlers o_ tho Tennessee RegU
merit, against whom are charges of being
implicated in the attack upon the person
and property of Dan Thomas, was In ses
sion yesterday. Private Davis of Com
pany L was before the court, and his
case was finished, and that of Private
Anderson of the same company was be
gun. The sessions are secret, and the
verdict will not be made known until it
has been approved or disapproved by the
commanding offiVer. The evidence so far
has not sustained the charges. The board
of officers appointed to assess the dam
ages in the case were also in secret ses
sion yesterday, and examined Major
Cheatham and two house contractors. It
Is their duty to fix the blame as a whole
and to ass-rss the amount of the damage.
This board will not complete Its work for
some time.
Colonel Funston of the Twentieth Kan
sas has threatened to put Lieuterint Col
onel Little under arrest for a tiolation of
the sixty-second article of war, which
treats of conduct prejudicial to military
discipline. Charges of incompotency were
some time ago made against Little, but
were dropped on account of his sickness.
It seems that recently Little made cer
tain recommendations as to the filling of
vacancies in the regiment. This angered
Colonel Funston, who claims this pre
rogative, and had himself already made
recommendations. Funston proposes to
find out who Is really the colonel of the
regiment.

HANDWRITING EXPERTS MAY DECIDE
THE FATE OF MRS. CORDELIA BOTKIN
The Accused Woman's Letters
to Be Compared With the
Anonymous Ones.
Police Arranging Their Evidence in Prepara
tion for the Fight for Extra
dition.
Iff rs. Cordelia Botkln's fate Trill be
decided by experts in handwriting.
J. P. Dunning is credited with say
ing that she wrote the anonymous
letters which were sent to his wife
before she was murdered, and sev
eral persons have expressed an opin
ion that the authorship of the note
which accompanied the poisoned bon
bons was also written by the same
hand. The police axe still in the dark
as to the character and amount of ev
idence the Delaware officer is bring
ing to secure the extradition of the
accused woman. Her attorneys will
not permit her removal from the
State unless the requisition is per
fect.
State Detective McVey of Dela
ware is expected hero Sunday or
Monday.
Unknown persons are said to be
tampering with Clerk Oattrell of
Stockton.
Experts on handwriting will be the
principal witnesses in the trial of Mrs.
W. A. Botkin. if she is ever brought
before Judge and jury to answer to the
charge of poisoning Mrs. J. P. Dunning
and Mrs. J. D. Deane.
Chief Lees will not declare what evi
dence he has succeeded in gathering
preparatory to the arrival of State De
tective McVey of Delaware, but it is
known that samples of the handwrit
ing of the accused woman are diligent
ly and eagerly sought for by the po
lice. Several letters written by her
to Dunning and to other parties have
already been obtained. As soon as
McVey reaches this city comparisons
â¢will be ir.ade with the anonymous let
ters sent from San Fraoicisco to Mrs.
Dunning. The address on the fatal
â¢ package of bonbons and the note In
closed within it will also be submitted
to microscopic and other tests to dis
cover, if possible, if they were written
by the woman now under arrest for the
awful crime.
The result of many famous criminal
end and civil cases have hinged com
pletely on the testimony of scientific
experts in chirography and the im
: pending trial of Mrs. Botkin will add
.-.another to the long list.
:â¢" It has repeatedly been demonstrated
that handwriting is distinctively indi
vidual and that only an expert forger
can completely disguise idiosyncrasies
' -which characterize a person's script.
: Temperament and character are por
: trayed in letters and signatures to a
far greater degree than most poople
â ' appreciate, and the police are, there
fore, especially anxious about the opin
ion which will be r^ven by the experts
' after they have examined the writings
In the Dunning case.
' Several persons familiar with Mrs.
Botkin's writing have declared that
there is a startling similarity In the
. strokes, shadlnrs, curves and letters
and other characteristics and the pub
lished fac similes of the anonymous
letters and the note sent in the candy
.box. Mrs. .Louise Seeley, one of the
'.alleged poisoner's former friends, has
â¢. noticed the similitude in the writings
and Chief Lees has also formed an
opinion in the matter. These opinions,
however, are of no value as evidence
and not until scientific tests have been
. completed will their soundness be de
monstrated.
J. P. Dunning, the husband of one of
the victims, is reported as having de
clared that the anonymous letters re
ceived by his wife were written by
Mrs. Botkin. Dunning ought to be
able to recognize her chirogTaphy, as
he has received numerous epistles from
her since he left San Francisco.
Samples of the writing In the case,
it is said, have been tested by noted
Eastern experts and they have de
clared they were all written by the
same hand. Dunning will be one of
the chief witnesses in the case and will
identify Mrs. Botkin'3 writing, assum
ing, of course, that she will go to Del
aware and be placed on trial.
Chief Lees, assisted by Detectives
Gibson and Wrenn, is arranging all the
. evidence they have secured, which is to
be turned over to Detective McVey
when he arrives. The Delaware officer
le expected Sunday or Monday even-
Ing.
.. Chief Lees is a bit apprehensive re
garding the extradition proceedings,
. as there are so many technicalities in
.. the laws which the defendant's re
sourceful attorneys can raise to pre
vent her removal from the State. Anti
c'pating a bitter technical fight on be
half of Mrs. Botktn, the Chief yester
day sent tiie following telegram to
Attorney-General R. C. White of Dela
ware, in reply to a message asking
what affidavits would be required to
secure the extradition of the woman
now under arrest:
.Separate affidavits from all parties
knowing any facts tending to show who
committed Time, to wit: From postof
fiee authorities of date of receipt of box,
to whom delivered, by whom delivered to
fne victims, who partook of candy, date
of deaths, with cause; names of victims,
attending physicians on deceased; that
candy contained poison; affidavits frojn
Chemists analyzing candy, date of analy-
Bia, with result: parties present at eating
of candy. All these, with such other affi
davits obtainable concerning proof of
?ullt as would be sufficient to hold the de
endant to answer before magistrate for
final trial; and must be attached to and
made part of the requisition papers
properly exemplified by magistrate and
County Clerk and authenticated accord.
lng to law.
Our District Attorney, with above
facts, will undoubtedly be ablo to hold
jand extradite. If requisition mailed does
not contain sufficient facts as above, pre
pare others and forward as soon as pos
sible. Direct to me. She will resint requi
sition, and has two able attorneys. True
name on arrest of defendant given to me
as Cordelia Botkin. Have requisition pa
pers strictly legal, as they will be strictly
construed."
Acting District Attorney Hosmer and
Assistant District Attorney Joseph J.
Dunne are the Chief's legal advisers
In this case and they will conduct the
case for the Delaware authorities when
the Governor Is asked to grant the re
quisition. These attorneys are care
fully examining the law and are forti
fying themselves for a hard fight.
Whether or not Governor Budd will
.grant the requisition is wholly prob
lematical, as it is not known what evi
d'-nce the Eastern detectives have ob
tained.
Chief L<?es intimates that he has ac
cumulated some strong circumstantial
evidence which connects Mrs. Botkin
with the double crime, but he refuses
to divulge it. Nothing further can be
done, the Chief says, until DetectlA'e
McVey arrives with the candy box, let-
ters, etc.
Proprietor Kuhn of the Wave candy
store, at Stockton, his randy maker, Le
Grand, and his two clerks, Gattrell and
Miller, will come to the city early next
week and endeavor to Identify the re
maining candy and the box. Gat
trell and Miller will be given an op
portunity to identity Mrs. Botkin as
the woman who bought a box of candy
at the store three weeks ago, and put
some bonbons she had with her in the
box before it was wrapped up. Kuhn
bought his candy boxes in San Fran
cisco and the manufacturer says they
can identify all the goods they make.
Should these persons positively con
nect Mrs. Botkin with the incident re
ferred to and, then, if the candy maker
and box manufacturers recognize, their
Relatives and Friends Who Believe in Mrs. Botkin's Innocence.
products, the chain of evidence to con
vict the accused woman will be nearly
completed.
The postal authorities are earnestly
at work endeavoring to trace the box
of candy from this city. Inspectors
Munroe and Irwin say they have not
been able to ascertain where the mur
derous package was posted, but they
hope to do so. It was first assumed
by Chief Lees that the sender sent
the box as first class matter, but this
was an error. ThÂ« box contained a
pound of candy, and wrapped up
weighed about eighteen ounces. There
were four 5 cent stamps and one 2 cent
9tamp on the package. The rate of
postage on first class matter is 2 cents
an ounce and a fraction thereof, and
on fourth class is 1 cent an ounce. The
assassin made sure that there would
be no delay in the delivery of the mes
senger of death by putting 22 cents'
worth of stamps on it and sending it
as merchandise.
Chief Lees received a telegram from
Attorney Qeneral White yesterday
which said the Secretary of State had
prepared a requisition for Mrs. Botkin,
and It had been forwarded to Detective
McVey in care of Chief Lees.
After refusing to give out what evi
dence he has secured against Mrs. Bot
kin, Chief Lees said last night: 'I
have gathered only such evidence as is
material and have not been engaged
in chasing side issues. I have been
very particular in fixing dates In this
case, and Mrs. Botkin's statement is
conclusive and emphatic regarding her
visit to Stockton on July 27 "to 30. About
this time the Incident occurred, as re
lated by Gattrell and Miller, the em
ployes of the Wave candy store. If
they connect the suspected woman
with that occurrence a strong link is
forged. Mind, I do not express the
opinion that this woman is guilty of
the crime charged. I am following
every clew that turns up, and when
McVey tells me what he has in the
shape of evidence I will perhaps be
able to form an opinion on the guilt
or innocence of the prisoner. Any mys
terious case can be solved in a hun
dred, different ways, theoretically, but
to convict a person of crime facts mus.t
be obtained and verified by competent
witnesses."
Mrs. John Martin, whose name Is fa
miliar to newspapers readers, appeared
at the Chief's office yesterday. She
has a theory on the Dunning case
which she wished to deliver to the
Chief personally, but Lees was "too
busy" to receive it. He offered the
newspaper men present as a substi
tute. Mrs. Martin's theory Is that
Dunning was in love with Mrs. Botkin
and wished to marry her. With the
THE SAIST FBAIN CISCO CALL, SATURDAY, AUGUST 27, 1898.
assistance of an accomplice in San
Francisco, he murdered his wife by
sending the poisoned candy to her.
She maintains the police are on the
wrong scent and said Dunning should
be arrested.
Mrs. Rose French also called to see
the Chief regarding the all-absorbing
murder case. She had her reticule and
pencil, but if she had a theory she kept
It to herself.
TAMPERING WITH
CLERK GATTRELL
Unknown Parties Test His
Memory With a Candy
Box.
STOCKTON, Aug. 26.â Unknown
parties, who did not disclose their mo
tive, made an attempt to test young
Gattrell's memory to-day. The indi
viduals who accosted the candy-store
clerk are presumed to be friendly to
Mrs. Botkin, the alleged poisoner. The
parties referred to went Into the Wave
store and exhibited a box to Gattrell
and told him It was the identical stock
used by the Wave at the time the sale
was made to the strange woman three
weeks ago, and that it had been pur
chased at the store. Both Gattrell and
Proprietor Kuhn quicklyand positively
denied the truth of the assertion and
pointed out discrepancies.
Proprietor Kuhn of the Wave says
he is certain of three things. The first
is that we will know our own candy,
another that It will be easy to recog
nize the box, and third, that neither
my clerks nor myself recall another
occasion when a woman brought candy
to the store and asked us to mix it in
with our 'own stock. We can identify
our candy by size; color and shape, and
also by reason of the fact that in my
string of molds for chocolate creams
there is one which is lopsided. The
ordinary customer would not notice
this, but I would to a certainty.
I think all these pictures published
in the San Francisco papers of the box
of candy, indicate that it was not fin
ally packed by a confectioner. No
candy man would throw goods into a
box In that shape. If the diagram is
correct the candy was handled by an
amateur.
The police have failed to find any re
corded sale of arsenic to Mrs. BotkiVi.
The sales of the poi3on at the drug
stores for the last thirty days have all
been to persons well known to the
druggists, and the customary registra
tion In the poison book was required.
T. F. Emerson, who has apartments
at 421 East Fremont street, the house
'owned by Mrs. Rauof, and to which
she brought Mrs. Botkin, acknowl
edged to-day that the landlady re
moved Mrs. Botkin from the place be
cause tenants were objecting to some
thing and had threatened to move.
Mrs. Rauof quitted her own home when
she could no longer keep Mrs. Botkin
there. An officer, whose name is with
held and who has been working on the
case, has expressed a positive opinion
that the "nurse" could tell considera
ble of Mrs. Botkin's characteristics if
she were so minded. Mrs. Rauof is
credited with having a very close
tongue and being far above the aver
age woman in managing her worldly
affairs.
Mr. Botkin and his son, Beverl-, were
at their grain office to-day doing busi
ness as usual. Botkin senior assumes
a nonchalant air. but it Is plain that
inwardly he is much perturbed over the
developments of last week. He reaf
firms his belief In his wife's innocence,
but wIH discuss the case only in a gen
eral way with his moat Intimate
friends. Beverly Botkin Is absolutely
unapproachable.
Wijllam R. Thomas, a veteran con
fectioner of this city, to-day exhibited
to a Call correspondent a box bearing
some resemblance to and manufactured
by the same firm as the one Frank
Gattrell sold to the strange woman.
Mr. Thomas says it Is no wild state
m?nt that a candy maker will recog
nize his own stock and be believes that
the Wave people are entirely compe
tent to pass an opinion as to whether
or not the box now en route from Del
aware was from their store or not.
"This bonbon box is a kind we
keep in stock in case we run out of
those made especially for us and bear
ing our label," he said. "The bottom
of the box proper has no projecting
edge, when the lid is put on. The box
part Is telescoped by the lid. The
glazed or polished surface is on the
cover only. The flush at the bottom
is Jnet sufficient to present an even
surface when the lid is put on. Some
of these features will probably re
found In the box used by the Wave, as
it is very distinct from the special
boxes."
Dr. Stone in further comments On the
condition of Mrs. Botkin while here
said: "Her nerves were shattered, and
she jumped at the least sound. Once I
was talking with her nurse. Mrs.
Rauof, and she came to the door and
peered around the partition that sepa
rated the two rooms."
This latter statement is regarded as
particularly significant; showing that
Mrs. Botkin was suspicious, and did not
like to see an exchange of confidences
between two persons who knew her so
well.
Frank Cattrell asserts that vouner
Miller's statement concerning the cir
cumstances attending the sale of candy
to the strange woman is substantially
correct. The officers have found no
material discrepancies in the stories of
the boys.
Chief Gall is watching every feature
of the case carefully and 1p inclined to
believe that the evidence which his of
fice has secured is sound and will be
corroborated by subsequent investiga
tions. Little can be done, he states, un
til the Delaware officer arrives. He
will have the witnesses here ready to
respond to any request of Chief Lees to
come to San Francisco.
WILL MAKE A
HARD FIGHT
Mrs. Botkln's Attorneys Will
Strongly Contest the
Prosecution.
The attorneys for Mrs. Botkln ara
anxiously awaiting the arrival of the
extradition papers from Delaware. If
an opportunity is afforded them they
will make a fight to prevent Mrs. Bot
kin being taken out of the State.
"It is just this way." said Attorney
George A Knight. "If the extradition
papers are regular In form we will not
make any contest. If there is any
thing irregular in their form we will
resort to the courts to secure *+>â¢ re
lease of our client. We would be lack
ing in our duty if we allowed any of
ficer to take Mrs. Botkin outside the
Jurisdiction of our courts without hav
ing extradition papers properly pre
pared and signed."
"It is reported," suggested a Call re
porter, "that Mrs. Botkin is preparing
a statement over her own signature to
be given to the press."
"Thero is nothing in the story," re
plied Knight. "Mrs. Botkin is inno
cent, and at the proper time that will
be made apparent. She is not going
to make any statement, either oral or
written. She is acting under the ad
vice of her counsel and will be guided
by that advice. The only statement
she could make would be contained in
the few words, 'I am innovent of the
charge.' When the time comes it will
be shown that such a statement is
true."
Attorney Frank McGowan. who is
associated with Knight in the defense,
says that there is absolutely nothing
new in the case. "N. C. McClure, a
brother-in-law of Mrs. Botkin, arrived
here to-day with his wife," said Mc-
Gowan, "but they know nothing about
the case. All they can say i 3 that
they are greatly surprised that sucn a.
charge should have been made against
Mrs. Botkin. They are firm in their
belief that she is innocent and that
subsequent Investigations will prove
that they are right."
William Robarts, another brother-in
law of the accused, was expected here
yesterday morning, but he did not ar
rive. It is thought that he will reach
the city to-day or Monday at the
latest.
BELIEVES SHE
IS INNOCENT
Pastor Coombe Visits the Ac
cused Woman in Her
Cell:
Pastor Coombe of the Richmond Dis
trict Congregational Church visited Mrs.
Botkin in the City Prison yesterday. Mr.
Coombe was accompanied by his wife ana
remained with the prisoner for more than
one hour.
The friendship existing between the ac
cused woman and the minister dates back
to old Ferndale days. Pastor Coombe
presided over the Ferndale Congregational
Church, where Mrs. Botkin and her sis
ters worshiped. It was In memory of
these other days that Mr. and Mrs.
Coombe paid their respects %esterday to
the woman who has been accused of the
horrible crime.
With diffidence and an evident reluct
ance, Mr. Coombe spoke of his visit to the
prisoner. "It is not right that I should
speak of what passed between us, he de
clared, "not that anything was said that
might not, with perfect Impunity, be made
gublic. The pastor admitted that Mrs.
otkln, of her own free will, broached the
horrible crime of which she stands ac
cused, but further than that Mr. Coombe
had nothing to say.
The minister is confident that Mrs. Bot
kin is innocent and is also convinced that
she will have no difficulty in establishing
her innocence.
"She comes from a fine old family,
said Mr. Coombe. "and I feel positive that
no one who comes from such good stock
could be guilty of so heinous a crime.'
Mr. Coombe is also convinced t'.iat the
published accounts of the orgies that
made midnight hideous at the Geary
street lodging house are gross exaggera
tions If not pure fabrications. "It would
take some pretty direct testimony to
make m<Â» believe those tales," he said.
The mannerisms of Mrs. Botkin that
have been df-scanted upon, her grand elo
quent phrases, her dramatic gestures and
theatrical manners are explained by the
minister to be the natural r -suit of asso
ciation with English people. "Mrs. Bot
kin associated with English residents at
Ferndnlt. and her way? are the ways of
the English. Her English mannerisms are
the characteristic mannerisms of all her
family."
Mr. Coombe has been in this city for
five years and in that time has seen Mrs.
Botkin but twice. Once he called on herâ
cm his arrival in town in '95 â and once
again he had a passing glimpse of the
laoy as he rode by her on the cable car.
MRS. BOTKIN'S
SISTERS HERE
They Did Not Call Upon
Their Unfortunate
Relative.
Two of Mrs. Botkln's sisters arrived in
San Francisco yesterday morning, and
neither of them visited the City Prison
to see the unfortunate woman. The ob
ject may have been to avoid newspaper
reporters and the publicity such a visit
would be sure to bring about. Mrs. Rob
arts, a sister from Ferndale, Humboldt
County, accompanied by her husband,
arrived at 12 o'clock yesterday morning
on the steamer Point Arena. They en
gaged apartments uptown and during the
oay had several consultations with
friends of the family.
Mrs. McClure, an elder sister, came
down from Healdsburg at 10:30 o'clock
with her husband, Professor McClure of
the Healdsburg College. After leaving
the steamer they walked about the ferry
building for a few moments and then
got on a Market street car and alighted
near the new City Hall. Mrs. McClure
Is about 50 years of age, has a sad but
rather prepossessing expression, and her
face bore evidence of great sorrow. She
wore a dark veil, and seemed too pre
occupied to take much note of passing
events.
Professor McClure, who is a typi
cal specimen of Scotch gentleman,
active and alert, assisted his wife up the
stairs at 1436 Market street, to room
7, where a number of friends
were waiting to receive them. An hour
was spent in talking oy.er the situation
and then they engaged apartments in
another part of the city.
"I can add nothing to the reports al
ready published in the newspapers," Mrs.
McClure said, "and until I shall have had
time to talk over the situation with other
members of the family and attorneys I
can make no statements. Yes, we pro
pose to render Mrs. Botkln all the as
sistance possible to establish her Inno
cence."
Mrs. McClure was too much distressed
and agitated over the unfortunate pre
dicament of her sister to be Interviewed.
She was laboring under a great mental
strain as though the blow had crushed
her spirit entirely. Her every expression
and action Indicated only too plainly
that she fully appreciated the disgrace
brought upon the family by the serious
accusation hanging over her sister. As
soon as she has recovered sufficient
strength and Is a little more composed
she and Mrs. Robarts will probably ask
Chief of Police Lees for permission to
visit Mrs. Botkin. It is needless to say,
of course, that they have full faith in
the. Innocence of Mrs. Botkln, and con
sider that she Is the victim of a terrible
plot.
SHE SENT FOR
HIS TRUNK
Mrs. Botkin Had Dunnlng's
Effects Taken to Her
Room.
Almost every day additional Informa
tion comes to light showing the Intimate
relationship existing between Dunning
and Mrs. Botkin. Several weeks af
ter Dunning's departure for the East ana
Cuba his bicycle, trunk and two grips, at
the instance of Mrs. Botkin, were remov
ed from a California street house to her
apartments in the Victoria.
After 1. aving 927 Geary street Mrs. Bot
kin removed to 1350 California street,
where she stopped a few weeks,
then engaged rooms at the Victoria, bhe
lived also at 1522 California street for
several years. *
POLICE CANNOT
OPEN LETTERS
Mrs. Botkin's Mail Must Be
Given Into Her Own
Hands.
The polJce are anxiously awaiting the
arrival of a letter from Delaware ad
dressed to Mrs. Botkin. Some days ago
Chief of Police I^ees received a dispatch
from the authorities of that State asking
him to intercept and hold the letter, pend
ing the arrival of the officer with the re
quisition. An intimation has gone out
that the missive is from Dunning, and
was written a few days after the death
of his wife and her sister. The Chief will
be informed when the letter arrive-*, cut
he cannot open it, and Mrs. Botkin v. In
have the pleasure of being the first to
break the envelope and read the contents.
An officer will be on hand, however, tc
prevent her attempting to destroy it. and
then, in conformity with the rule that
prisoners must surrender all propertj ,
Sirs. Botkin will be required to deliver
the letter to the police.
The Dover officers expect the letter to
shed important light upon the murder
mystery. They have repeatedly urged
Chief of Police Lees by telegraph to be
sure and get possession of the message.
The barrier that confronts the success
of the plan is the United Startes postal
law. The regulations are very stringent
in a matter of this character Chief Pos
tal Inspector Munro' and his assistant,
Mr. Irwin, spent a couple of hours yes
terday in consultation with Chief Lees
and carefully examined the law and de
cisions, and It was decided that the letter
should be delivered to Mrs. Botkin, and
then the United States, as a carrier,
would lose ail jurisdiction In the prem
ises.
PRISON TERRORS
HAVE VANISHED
Mrs. Botkin Dons a New
Dress and Appears
Cheerful.
The terrors of prison life are commenc
ing to dissolve slowly and Mrs. Botkin
Is becoming more cheerful in spirit and
to some extent resigned to the
situation. She is enjoying her
meals with more reilsh and is
taking a deeper interest in the news of
the day aside from her own case. Shs
spends the best portion of the day read
ing the newspapers, and is ever ready to
engage in light conversation with the at
tendants.
Yesterday she was attired in a new
dark dress, and after partaking of a
light breakfast and finishing with Uie
morning papers she sent for Senator Mc-
Gowarr, one of her attorneys..
The lawyer arrived about 2 o"clock and
spent more than an hour in the mat
ron's reception room in close consultation
with the woman. On the table was a
large bouquet of fragrant flowers which
greatly relieved the barrenness ot the
apartments.
Dunning Is in Chicago.
CHICAGO, Aug. 26.â John P. Dunning,
husband of one of the two women poi
soned at Dover, arrived in Chicago this
morning. He came at the request of
Melville E. Stone, general manager of the
Associated Press, and the two had an
extended conference.
"The talk was about a personal mat
ter," Mr. Stone said to-day. That Is all
he would say about it. Mr. Dunning was
quite as reticent on the subject. Con
cerning the report from San Francisco
that the authorities there were prepared
to Intercept a letter "from Dunning to
Mrs. Botkin, Dunnlnff said: "All I can
say about that is that I have had no
communication whatever with Mrs. Bot
kin since I came back from Porto
Rico."
Regarding his plans for the future
Dunning would say nothing.
Could Identify the Wrapper.
STOCKTON, Aug. 26.â Proprietor Kuhn
of the *. 'aye candy store says it would
be an easy matter to identify the paper
in which the box of candy was wrapped,
for the reason that it was not the paper
that he usually uses in his business. It
was some blue paper of a different quality
entirely, which he secured at Paterson's
pharmacy, a drug store across the street
from the candy store, as he had run out
of the rtock such as he generally usedâ
pink, white and blue book paper. The
drugstore paper is smooth, blue wrapping
paper, somewhat mottled in appearance
and very tough.

DR. COOL PROMOTED.
Elected President of the Pacific Coast
Dental Congress.
Dr. Russell H. Cool of San Francisco
was yesterday elected at Portland, Ore
gon, president of the Pacific Coast Dental
Congress. The election, apart from the
recognition bestowed by his fellow men
of the profession, confers upon Dr. Cool
the honor of presiding at the session of
the Congress next year to be held in this;
city.
Marchand's New Restaurant.
About three months ago, at a dinner
given by the proprietor to a number
of hia patrons and friends, the curtain
was rung down on the famous old
Marchand restaurant, 117 Grant ave
nue, which had for twenty-one years
past catered to the creature comfort of
many thousands.
The handsome new five-story struc
ture at thp northeast corner of Geary
and Stockton streets is the new home
of Marchand's. which will be opened
to-night at 6 o'clock. There is a pub
lic dining-room, a banquet hall, priv
ate dining-rooms and bachelors' apart
ments. The furnishings are rich and
elegant. The catering will, as of
yore, be In Marchand's own inimitable
style. The legion of old patrons and
the public generally are invited to call
and inspect the new establishment.
Will Support Gattrell's Story.
OAKLAND, Aug. 26.â Raymond Miller,
one of the clerks of the Wave candy
store, Stockton, whose story regarding
the mysterious woman's purchase cf
chocolates about three weeks ago was
published in this morning's Call, said to
day:
"Thus far no one has asked me to go
to San Francisco and take a look at Airs.
Botkin, to see whether or not I could
identify her as the woman who purchased
the chocolates and wanted some other
candies, which she had in a small bag,
packed in one of the Wave's boxes. Of
course, as I have stated before, I never
paid much attention to the customer at
the time and really I feel almost confident
that I would not be able to identify her.
However, I might corroborate various
points brought out by Mr. Gattrell."
Young Miller has been visiting friends
at 669 East Twenty-fourth street the past
week, but expects to leave to-morrow or
Sunday for his home at Stockton.
