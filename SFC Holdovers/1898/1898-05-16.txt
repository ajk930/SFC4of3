MOVING TOWARD THE

Expects to Soon Meet or Intercept the
Spanish Fleet in the Waters

Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, May \%.
Secretary Long believes
that Admiral Sampson is
steaming rapidly toward the
Windward passage, the nar
row channel that separates
Hayti from Cuba. His pur
pose, as the Navy Depart
ment understands it, is to
meet the Sp anish fleet in the
waters south of Cuba, where
it is surmised an attack upon
isolated American vessels is
contemplated by the Spanish
admiral.
Having already covered the
distance to Puerto Plata,
Hayti, the American com-
mander can easily reach his
destination ahead of his ad-
versary, and should Secre-
tary Long's theory prove cor
rect, the most notable en
gagement of the war may be
fought within the next forty
eight hours. The latest re
ports from the Spanish fleet
indicate that it is still at
Curacoa, off the coast of
Venezuela. Coal may be had
at that port, and minor re
pairs to ships may be made,
hence the Navy Department
will not be surprised should
the fleet delay its departure
for another day. Cable com-
munication with Madrid is
possible from Curacoa both
by way of the French line to
New York and by land lines
to Pernambuco, Brazil, and
thence by cable to Lisbon.
The startling report current
here to-day that the auxiliary
cruiser Yale had been cap
tured by a Spanish man-of-
war was fully discredited this
afternoon, when news came
direct from St. Thomas that
the ocean greyhound had
sailed westward from that
point to-day.
The Secretary of the Navy
feels more concern for the
Harvard, the Yale's sister
ship. She is now in port at
St. Pierre, Martinique, and
under the ruling made in her
case by the French author
ities she may remain there
The San Francisco Call
several days. The Navy De
partment was to-day in
formed that the Spanish tor
pedo-boat Terror had also en
tered that port, "having
broken down."
The Navy Department re
ceived toth good and bad
news to-day â the former
from Manila and the latter
from Havana. Secretary Long
in speaking of the advices
from the Philippines said to
the Call correspondent to
night: '
"We were much gratified
to-day to receive a cablegram
from Hongkong transmitting
a message from Admiral
Dewey stating that he has
everything he wants at
Manila, including coal, am
munition and provisions. The
city, he says, is at his mercy,
but we assume he will not
attempt to occupy it until his
re-enforcements arrive. The
inhabitants of Manila are re
duced to a diet of horse flesh
and 5000 Spaniards are en
camped on the road between
Cavite and Manila. The in
surgents have applied to Ad
miral Dewey for permission
to attack the city and it has
been given with the stipula
tion that no excesses of any
kind shall be indulged Jin."
A dispatch from Hongkong
brings the additional informa
tion that Admiral Dewey has
captured the Spanish gun
boat Callao near Manila. The
Navy Department has no ad
vices as to whether the
Charleston convoying the
City of Peking sailed to-day,
but Secretary Long said to
night he had no doubt the
two vessels would be under
way by to-morrow morning.
The First Regiment of Cali
fornia Volunteers would, he
thinks, leave for Manila to
morrow. Less anxiety is felt
for the early departure of the
expedition to the Philippines,
now that it is known that
Admiral Dewey is well fur
nished with war supplies of
every kind.
To-day discouraging news
comes from Havana. Reliable
SAN FRANCISCO, MONDAY, MAY 16, 1898?
advices state that since the
blockade began the treatment
of the reconcentrados has
been even more inhuman
than before, and that at the
present time only a remnant
of them survive, and these
are doomed to an early death
by starvation. The President
is deeply affected by this in
formation, as he has alwa\ s
cherished the hope that suc
cess would crown the efforts
of the American arms in time
to render substantial aid to
the wretched people in whose
behalf the war with Spain
was begun.
The failure of the steamer
Gussie to land her cargo of
arms and provisions was a
great disappointment to the
President and is emphasized
by the latest reports to the
effect that Blanco has suc
ceeded in throwing up sev
eral miles of serviceable
earthworks along the Cuban
coast which will add to the
difficulty of landing and com
municating with the insur
gents. The condition of the
poor on the island may te
judged from the fact that the
French Consul at Santiago
has wired his Government
that he is in need of food,
which must be forthcoming
at once.
News has also reached the
administration that the rainy
season in the island of Cuba
has set in earlier than usual
and that much sickness has
resulted. This information is
specially discouraging to the
War Department, which is
making every preparation to
invade Cuba with a big army
the moment Sampson dis
poses of the Span^h fleet.
Surgeon-General Sternberg
takes a cheerful view of the
prospect, however, and de
clares that with the precau
tions that will be employed
very little is to be feared by
the invading army. But on
every hand the fervent hope
is expressed that Sampson
will lose no time in finding
and destroying the Spanish
squadroa

FLYING SQUADRON
IN BATTLE ARRAY
Commodore Schley Makes a Very
Brief Stop at Charleston to
Receive Orders,
CHARLESTON, S. C, May 15.â
Commodore Schley's flying
squadron passed here at 5:30
this afternoon, stopping just long
enough to receive orders that
were awaiting on board the
lighthouse tender Wisteria. The
squadron was under full head
way again in fifteen minutes and
soon passed out of range to the
southward. Nothing could be
obtained from the naval district
commander as to the destination
of the squadron, but the impres
sion prevails that it is bound for
Key West. Commodore Schley
reported all well.
ON BOARD THE FLAGSHIP
BROOKLYN of the flying squad
ron off Charleston, S. C, May
15. â The four vessels of war, com
prising the major portion of the flying
squadron, arrived off Charleston bar,
nine miles from Charleston city, at 4
o'clock this afternoon, after having
been at sea three days, and having seen
no sign of the Spanish cruisers or tor
pedo boats, said to be in this locality.
The pilots were dropped at Cape Henry
on Friday night, and the squadron pro
ceeded to sea at a ten-knot squadron
speed. At sunset active battle prepara
tions were made. Ports were closed
with steel covers, battle hatches cov
ered, the main battleship's guns loaded
and men sent to the guns with instruc
tions for a night watch to be kept..
With all lights extinguished, the squad
ron proceeded in a southeasterly direc
tion. Toward morning several heavy
fog banks were run into and during one
of these intervals the collier Sterling
became detached. To wait for her was
partly the reason that anchorage was
made, although Commodore Schley
communicated at once with Washing-
ton and the Navy Department. When
the collier arrives all the ships will take
coal and then proceed to sea again.
The only incident of the trip from
Hampton Roads was the holding up or
a British steamer that did not display'
its flag. The Scorpion was sent after
her and soon overhauled her. She
proved to be the British steamer Elsio,
with a load of phosphate rock, bound
for Norfolk, Va. She was allowed
to proceed. There were several
ludicrous incidents, mostly enacted at
night, and evidently arising from lack
of knowledge of the nationality of our
ships, no colors or lights being dis
played. On Saturday night a swift
merchantman crossed the bows of the
Brooklyn. Suddenly the big warship
turned on her side lights. Instantly
every light on the merchantman went
out and she made a run, evidently be
lieving that she had encountered the
Spanish. No attempt was made to un
deceive her, and it is expected that she
will report having seen a hostile fleet.
On Sunday morning a schooner on the'
horizon, bearing 1 north toward the
ships, suddenly caught sight of the
squadron, and, reversing her position,
disappeared from view. The fleet had
splendid weather and a smooth sea.
The squadron has been ordered to Key
West, and sails to-night.
NEWARK AS FLAGSHIP
OF THE BLOCKADERS.
Has Been Remodeled and Will Be
Able to Give a Good Account
of Herself.
NEW YORK, May 15.â A "Washington
special to the Herald says: It has been
practically determined to make the
Newark the flagship of the blockading
squadron in Cuban waters, and as soon
as she can possibly leave tl.- Norfolk
navy yard, where she will be placed in
commission on Saturday next, she will
be sent South. Her commanding offi
cer will be Captain A. S. Barker, for
merly in command of the Oregon and
now a member of the naval war board
and army and navy board. Captain
Barker and his subordinate officers
have been directed to report on board
the Newark next Friday.
Captain A. S. Crowninshie^. chief of
the bureau of navigation, has succeed
ed in collecting a crew for the vessel, so
that she can proceed to sea within a
few days after her entrance into active
service. As a result * the alterations
made* to the Newark, she is considered
by naval experts to be the finest of her
tonnage and class afloat. She is now
armed with a formidable battery of
twelve six-inch rapid-fire guns, besides
smaller guns, and will be able to give a
splendid account of herself in an en
gagement with Spanish men-of-war.
As a result of the orders given Cap
tain Barker, the army and navy war
board will dissolve, and it is proposed
to place authority for drawing up plans
of defensive operations of a military
and naval character by officers on the
ground, so that they can take such ac
tion as developments may make neces
sary.
SPAIN FORTIFYING
THE CANARY ISLANDS.
Vigorous Preparations to Meet an
Attack by a Fleet of Amer
ican Ships.
SOUTHAMPTON. May 15.â The Brit
ish steamer Gault, from Table Bay on
April 23 for this port, via Teneriffe,
Canary Islands, am d here to-day.
She left Teneriffe on May 9, and on that
day martial law was declared on the
island.
Captain O'Donoghue, one of the pas
sengers on board, who is on his way to
join the United States am â¢'. said there
were several thousand troops at Ten
eriffe, of which number 1000 were artil
lerymen. He added that 800 engineers
and 6000 men were working day and
night, throwing up breastworks and
bastions to double the strength of the
fortifications at all vulnerable points.
The captain said it would take a strong
fj ee t to take the island. He believed the
waters of the harbor were not mined
and said the Spanish soldiers were of
excellent physique and a_ fine a body
of men as he had ever seen.
PLANS TO CRUSH
CERVERA'S FLEET
But Sampson's Most Difficult
Task Will Be to Engage the
Enemy in Battle.
NEW YORK, May 15.â
The Herald's Washington
correspondent telegraphs:
How to "capture or destroy*'
the Spanish fleet now in the
Caribbean Sea is the great
war question cf the hour. Offi-
cial information was received
by the State Department this
afternoon from Consul Smith
at Curacoa that the Spanish
squadron intended to leave
there to-day, and it is the be
lief of the Naval Board that
it is now or soon will be on
its way to a point where its
colliers are lying. Our fight
ing and flying squadrons are
in quest of the enemy. They
are maneuvering for desir
able positions, while the
Naval War Âoard is the di
recting power.
This is the situation to-night, a
situation liable to great change with
in the next twenty-four hours. It is
improving every moment of time
given it, as a result of the present
location of the Spanish men-of-war.
The Naval War Board was in session
to-day, and when it adjourned at a
late hour the members were confident
that they had taken every precaution
that their naval experience and best
judgment dictated to defend their
country and bring an early defeat to
the enemy's force.
On account of the lack of reliable
information concerning the Spanish
fleet, the Naval War Board has been
greatly handicapped in its work of
preparing the plan for encompassing
its destruction. As the Herald has
stated, it was informed some days
ago from an English source that col
liers carrying coal had left England
before that Government declared neu
trality for the coast of Vene
zuela. It develops to-day that in
stead of two colliers, as has been be
lieved, there were four of these ves
sels, carrying about 8000 tons of coal,
sufficient to recoal every ship of the
Spanish squadron. It is believed by
members of the board that the arrival
of the Spanish squadron at Curacoa
was due to the necessity of communi
cating with the colliers in order to
appoint a rendezvous along the Vene
zuelan coast, where the coal can be
taken aboard without interruption
from American ships or heavy sea.
It is estimated by naval experts
that the enemy's men-of-war have
practically exhausted their supply of
fuel, and that before making any
other point they must recoal. This
operation, it is expected, will occupy
at least two days, so that after the
men-of-war leave Curacoa it is not

Official advices are to the effect

I that the fleet when it left Cape Verde
consisted of seven ships, and one of

CHAMBERLAIN'S SPEECH .
ENRAGES SPANIARDS
Madrid Newspapers Declare That an Anglo-
American Alliance Would Inflame
the World.
MADRID, May 15.â Spain is not pleased with the utterances on the
subject of the possibilities of an alliance between the United States and
Great Britain.
The Spanish Embassador at London, Count Rascon, telegraphed an
extract of the recent speech of Mr. Joseph Chamberlain, the British
Secretary of State for the Colonies, at Birmingham, on Friday even
ing last, to Senor Gullon, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who immedi
ately conferred on the subject with the Premier, Senor Sagasta, with
the result that the latter requested the Minister for Foreign Affairs to
render a detailed account of Mr. Chamberlain's remarks. Consequently,
the Foreign Minister cabled to Count Rascon for a fuller report of the
speech. This, it is understood, has been received, and the Spanish Min
isters were to discuss it at their meeting to-day.
Spain, it is said, upon good authority, will draw the attention of
the powers to the transcendency of the suggested Anglo-American al
liance with respect to European Interests.
The Spanish newspapers and the politicians here of all classes dis
cuss Mr. Chamberlain's speech most angrily. They consider it to be a
sequel to the Marquis of Salisbury's warnings to Spain, whose domin
ions, it seems, are to be absorbed by strong enemies.
The Liberal, referring to the suggested Anglo-Saxon alliance, says:
"If any alliance, defensive and offensive, is signed, the same day the
general conflagration will burst out, which has been so long suppressed
by the powers. An Anglo-American union will be faced by Russia
and Germany with their allies, and our Western and Eastern posses
sions now on fire will be an Insignificant episode compared with the con
flagration in India, South Africa and China. If the Anglo-American
alliance succeeds, Europe, which has heretofore been indifferent to our
case, will take our part, not to favor us, but to defend her own prepon
derance in the world."
The Imparcial contrasts the speech of Mr. Chamberlain with the
reported action of the crew of the French cruiser Amiral Rigault de
Genouilly, in cheering for Spain aftter the bombardment of San Juan
de Porto Rico, which was witnessed by that vessel, as being indicative
of a coming Â«-^eat war in Europe against the Anerlo-Saxons. Continuing,
the Imparcial points out that "as Spain single-handed makes headway
against the United States, she would prove a valuable factor in the
combination against the Anglo-Saxons."
ing preparations to place Rear Ad
miral Sampson's fleet and Commodore
Schley's force in an advantageous po
sition, so that when darkness falls
that it may be strategically disposed
to meet the enemy when light reap-
pears on his movements. There is no
reason to believe that the plan deter
mined upon by the War Board to
place Rear Admiral Sampson's squad
ron to the south of the Haytian
coast, in the immediate vicinity of
the Windward Passage, has been
changed.
The department has been advised
that Rear Admiral Sampson, acting
in accordance with Instructions sent
him last night by the Naval War
Board, is making all speed to the
western end of Hayti, when he will
proceed, it is understood, down the
Windward Passage to take station at
its southern end. Here he will be in
close cable communication with the
department. He will be able to throw
his scouts out and will receive in
formation of the appearance of the
enemy within several hundred miles
of his position from them, and when
such information is received will be
able to act accordingly. Commodore
Schley's command is well on its -way
to Cuba. The Navy Department sent
a communication to Commodore
Schley off Charleston that the Span
ish fleet was at Curacoa, and he was
ordered to hasten with all dispatch
to Cuban waters, from which his
future movements will be directed by
the board.
Secretary Long's belief is this:
The enemy, depending upon superior
speed, will make every effort to cut
out isolated American ships and de
stroy them, running into Spanish
harbors to take on board supplies.
As soon as these supplies are re
ceived the Spanish admiral will
leave the harbor without delay and
continue his policy of attacking an
inferior force. It can be stated that
the Naval War Board is acting in
line with the Secretary's idea. When
the Spanish squadron has coaled it
is thought it will proceed to some
port on the southern coast of Cuba.
As the Herald has stated, the au
thorities believe that the men-of-war
on blockading duty in the vicinity of
Cienfuegos are safe, and, in fact, they
would like nothing better than for
the enemy's squadron to proceed to
Cienfuegos. Such action would result
in bringing down upon them Commo
dore Schley's fleet through Yucatan
Channel, while Rear Admiral Samp
son's fleet would hasten along the
south coast of Cuba, and the Span
iards would be caught between two
fires. Coaling from colliers imme
diately upon arrival will insure for
them ample coal during their stay
among the West Indies. Neutrality
permits them to visit different pos
sessions of foreign Governments and
get coal to carry them to the next
nearest port. They will have coal for
some little time after having pro
cured supplies from the colliers, so
mat they will not have to apply at
any of the islands and none of the
Governments will be able to refuse
them fuel should they ask for it in
the future. Once having coaled at a
foreign possession, however, they will
not be able to get further supply un
til ninety days have elapsed.

According to a prominent Alaskan now ;
in this city, there are a thousand men
in the coast towns of the great Terri- j

A message will be brought down on the

there will be a change in the original
orders sending the gunboat on another

will probably leave port for the mouth
of the Yukon River on May 28, with
Captain Pratt of the geological survey
and his party of river explorers. A
change of orders, sending the Wheeling
into Spanish waters, would come now
as a surprise, although a very welcome
one.
TARGET PRACTICE AT
SEA CAUSES ALARM.
Heavy Firing Off Chatham and Nan-

PROVINCETOWN, Mass., May 15.â A
report reached here at noon to-day that
heavy firing had been heard off Chat
ham and Nantucket. The San Fran
cisco, which was in the harbor, imme
diately put to sea, and when well down
the cape, met the Prairie on her way
to this port from a cruise to seaward.
Commander Train of the Prairie re
ported that the ship had been at tar
get practice off Chatham.
On the way down the cape the San
Francisco held up the Gate City of the
Savannah line, with two shots across
her bow. The captain of the latter boat
also reported the firing. Reports of
firing came from many points along the
cape and created the greatest excite

came in late in the ' afternoon. The
Prairie was on her way from New York
to Boston to Join the mosquito fleet and
was off Provincetown Sunday morning
when the Columbia, bound seaward,

started after the Columbia.

ON BOARD THE ASSOCIATED
PRESS DISPATCH BOAT KATE
SPENCER, off Havana, May 14, 'via
Key West, May 15.â Captain-General
Blanco, two hours before sundown to
night, attempted to execute a ruse
which, had it been successful, would
have cleared the front of Havana of six
ships on that blockading station. Un
able to come out to do battle, he adopt
ed the tactics of the spider and cun
ningly planned to draw the prey into
his net, but, though a clever and pretty
scheme as an original proposition, it
was practically a repetition of the trick
by which the gunboat Vicksburg and
the little converted revenue cutter Mor
rill were last week decoyed by a fishing
smack under the big Krupp guns of the
Santa Clara batteries. Thanks to bad
gunnery, however, both ships on that
occasion managed to get out of range
without being sunk, though some of the
shells burst close aboard and the Vicks
burg's ladder was cut adrift.
But the wary are never caught twice
in the same trap. Late this afternoon
the ships on the Havana station were
dumfounded to see two ships steam out
of Havana harbor and head east
ward. Dense smoke was streaming
like ribbons from their stacks, and a
glance showed that they were under a
full head of steam. By aid of glasses
Commander Lilly of the Mayflower,
which was flying the pennant, made out
the larger vessel of the two, which was
about 200 feet long and about 4500 tons
displacement, to be the Alfonso XII,
and the smaller one to be the Legazpi,
both of which were known to be bot
tled up in Havana harbor.
At first Lilly supposed they were tak
ing advantage of the absence of the
heavy firing ships and were making a
bona fide run for the open sea. As su
perior officer, he signaled the other
ships on the station â the Vicksburg,
Annapolis, Wasp, Tecumseh and Osce
ola â which were moving in to form a
column with gunboats on the right
flank.
The little squadron moved in
obliquely toward the fleeing Spaniards,
keeping up a running fire as they went.
The Alfonso and her consort circled in
shore about five miles below, and after
running in for half an hour, headed in
for Morro Castle. Our gunboats and
thin-skinned vessels of the mosquito
fleet did not follow them in.
Commander Lilly saw that the wily
Spanish ruse was to draw them in
under the fire of the heavy batteries,
where the Spanish artillery officers
could plot out the exact range, with
their telemeters and pot them. So the
return was made in line ahead parallel
with the shore.
Commander Lilly had not been mis
taken. As his ships came abreast of
the Santa Clara batteries the big guns
opened and fired thirteen shells at a
distance of about five miles. The
range was badly judged, as more than
half the shells overshot the mark and
others fell short, some by as much as
a mile.
A SPANISH VERSION.
How the Incident Ended in a Bout
of the Yankees.
MADRID. May 15.â The Imparcial to
day publishes a dispatch from Havana,
of a war episode. It says:
"On Friday the gunboats Conde de
Venadito and Nueva Espana steamed
out of the harbor and attacked an
American squadron of two cruisers and
five auxiliary cruisers vhich were out
side. The Spanish vessels fired two
shots and the Americans eight, the lat
ter apparently retreating: damaged.
Three crowded tugs followed the gun
boats, the people on board cheering
them."
It would seem possible that the facts
upon which the Imparcial's dispatches
are based are to be found in the dis
patch from the Associated Press dis
patch boat Kate Spencer, filed at Key
West to-day and sent out early this
morning. Two Spanish ships did steam
out of Havana harbor and tried to
draw some of our vessels under the
guns of the heavy Spanish batteries.
The ruse was unsuccessful, though the
Santa Clara battery sent some badly
aimed shells at our ships, which replied
by driving the two Soaniardf back into
Havana. The American report, how
ever, says that the Spanish vessels en
gaged were the Alfonso XIII and the
Legazpi, a cruiser and a gunboat which
have been blockaded in Havana harbor.
SPAIN'S FLEET REQUESTED
TO LEAVE CURACOA
Its Stay in Port Cut Short in Accord
ance With the Decree of
Neutrality.
Copyrighted, 1898. by James Gordon Bennett.
WILLEMSTAD, Curacao, May 15.â
The Spanish cruisers Viscaya and
Maria Teresa left this port at 6 o'clock
this evening. Their destination is un
known. Four other Spanish warships
which were off the harbor disappeared
about noon, but this evening one of the
torpedo boat destroyers was sighted
again. While here the two warships
took a small quantity of coal and pro
visions. Their departure was due to
our Government requesting them to
leave, as provided in the decree of neu
trality. There were no colliers with the
fleet. Nothing is known about the con
dition of their boilers.
A rumor which I do not consider re
liable, says there are some coal ships
in this vicinity.
"It Was a Spanish Victory."
ST. THOMAS, Danish West Indies,
May 15.â The captain general of Porto
Rico telegraphed the Spanish consul
here saying: "Eleven A- .erican war
ships have bombarded the forts of the
town. A heroic defense was made. The
soldiers are prepared to fight to the
death. The Americans retreated. Sev
eral of their ships were damaged and
one was towed away. It was a Span
ish victory."
The Army of Invasion.
TAMPA, Fla., May 15.â General or
ders for the organizing of the army of
invasion into several brigades will be
issued from headquarters to-morrow.
The cavalry will be divided into two
brigades, the infantry into four brig
ades and the artillery into one brigade.
A battalion of engineers is also formed.

War Department Issues
an Order Assigning
the Troops.
General Government Relieving
State Authorities of
Control.
No Particular Corps or Camp Will
Have Advantage in Going to
the Front.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, May 15.â After go
ing over the situation last evening
with General Miles, Adjutant General
Corbin and the heads of the supply de
partment, the Secretary of War made
an order for the assignment of volun
teer troops now being mustered into
the service of the United States, and
designated points where they will as
semble with the least possible delay.
This step was rendered necessary from
the fact that the State authorities are
very fast relinquishing control of
troops that are passing over the mus
ter line under authority of the general
government. It became necessary to
assemble these troops at once In order
to meet the problem of their subsist
ence, no less than that of their equip
ment In the way of arms, clothing,
camp and garrison equipage, to say
nothing of the superior advantage of
drill under trained officers, as it is the
intention that it shall be In every ln
stame. The officers to organize these
troops into brigades and divisions will
be determined upon very soon and will
be ordered to stations accordingly.
The impression that seems to obtain
that Any particular corps or camp will
have superior advantages in being sent
to the front is erroneous. The distri
bution of troops was made up on the
lines of transportation and supplies.
The supply departments will have a de
pot 1 each camp which can be more
readily reached than the troops could
at their rendezvous in their several
States. In addition to the companies
named the troops that will report to
the commanding general of the De
partment of the East, amounting to
about one army corps, will probably be
encamped a. son.c point on Long Isl
and. '
At the close of work yesterday at 6
o'clock the total number of troops
mustered ".< r as 65,000. Taking into con
sideration the careful physical exami
nation to which these men have been
subjected, the progress has been rapid.
The following order has been issued:
With the approval of the Secretary of
War. the following assignment of troops
is ordered by the major general command

FAILS TO LAND
WAR SUPPLIES
Dorst Expedition Returns
to Key West From
Cuba.
Insurgents Unable to Reach the
Rendezvous on the
Coast.
Finding . * Themselves Opposed by
Large Bodies of Troopa, the
Americans Turn Back.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
KEY WEST, May 15.â The steamer
Gussie, which left Tampa, Fla., on May
10, with two companies of the First In
fantry on board in charge of 7000 rifles
and 200,000 rounds of ammunition in
tended for the insurgents in the pro
vince of Pinar del Rio, remained off the
coast of Cuba on Thursday, Friday and
yesterday, convoyed by the auxiliary
gunboat Manning, in a vain attempt to
land her cargo. Captain J. H. Dorst, of
the staff of General Miles, and formerly
United States military attache at
Vienna, headed the expedition, which
returned here this morning.
Captain Dorst says the failure of the
expedition was due to the fact that the
Cubans were unable to meet the land
ing party at the rendezvous, and the
Americans could not land supplies with
no one to receive them.
The arrangements for making a land
ing at Cabanas were made ten days ago
by Captain Dorst with General Del
gado, in command of the insurgent
forces in the province of Pinar del Rio,
and the supplies to be landed near
Matanzas were to be conveyed to Gen
eral Gomez by a force of insurgents
encamped three miles back from the
coast line. Both of the Cuban parties
were unable, apparently, to appear at
the rendezvous, owing to the activity
of the Spaniards. Captain Dorst is
convinced that the Spaniards have a
good system of communication along
the coast, and they can quickly raise
enough troops to prevent the landing of
a small force, such as the one he com
manded, and the captain believes the
only way arms and ammunition can be
sent to the insurgents is to land them
under the cover of warships with guns
sufficient to beat off any attack. Then,
he adds, the arms and ammunition
should be conveyed inland by United
States soldiers.
The captain says the company which
landed through the surf at Cabanas had
a narrow escape. The soldiers were
fired upon by Spanish cavalry con
cealed in the tangled underbrush, and
the fire was replied to with the result
that one Spanish officer and three men
were hit. Only one man on the Amer
ican side was wounded. He was J. F.
J. Archibald, a newspaper correspond
ent of San Francisco, who received a
slight flesh wound in the arm. The
Wasp and Manning shelled the woods
and covered the retreat of the soldiers
to the Gussie.
On Friday the Spaniards tried to hit
the Gussie from a masked batery, and
some of their shells burst close on
board but none of the fragments
struck. The American party captured
a prisoner of war in a shack at Ca
banas.
After the skirmish with the Spanish
near Cabanas, Captain Dorst aban
doned the attempt at that point and
steamed eastward to Matanzas, where
an arrangement had been made with
the insurgents to send supplies ashore
at Point Maya, a mile or so east of the
entrance of the harbor.
The Gussie and her convoy yesterday
morning steamed until about two miles
off shore, when the rattle of musketry
from a considerable force of Spanish
soldiers, concealed behind underbrush
ashore, warned them that they would
receive a lively welcome if they landed.
The Spanish troops seemed to have
been given information of the contem
plated landing at both points.
After this second failure Captain
Dorst decided to abandon the attempt
to land the arms and ammunition and
returned to Key West.
A more disgusted looking lot of
troopers than those aboard the Gussie
this morning it would be hard to find.
They had received orders not to speak
of their trip and sullenly lined the rail
of the Gussie as a launch ran alongside
of her. But grunts were the only an
swers which could be obtained to ques
tions asked.
Soon after the arrival of the Gussie
Captain Dorst was rowed ashore and
reported the failure of his expedition to
the War Department.
Ernest Suntzenech. one of the Ameri
can seamen wounded at Cienfuegos last
Thursday, died at the Marine Hospital
here Thursday evening and was buried
to-day. He was a first-class seaman
and belonged to the United States
cruiser Marblehead. He was shot
through the left leg In a boat while as
sisting in cutting the cable off Cien
fuegos. He died after his limb had
been amputated. Deceased lived in
Brooklyn. â___________
OHIO'S ADVANCE GUARD
REACHES CHICKAMAUGA
Eight Troops of Cavalry and Eleven
Companies of Infantry Beady
for Service.
CHICKAMAUGA NATIONAL PARK,
Ga., May 15. â The First Ohio Cavalry,
the advance guard of the volunteer
army ordered by the War Department
to rendezvous at Camp Thomas, ar
rived to-day. The regiment is com
posed of eight troops, 600 officers and
men.
The regiment did not bring horses,
which are to be supplied here by the
Government. Only one troop was sup
plied with arms, and the large ma
jority of the men were without uni
forms. They did not, therefore, present
a very formidable military appearance.
They were supplied with tents by
Quartermaster Dee from the consign
ment sent here for the volunteer army.
Very few uniforms have been received
at the quartermaster's department
here, but an order <or 25,000 has been
sent In and will be filled just as rapidly
as possible. In the meantime the
volunteers will have to get along with
their old clothes as best they can.
To-night the First Ohio Infantry,
from Cincinnati, eleven companies, 800
officers and men, arrived in Chattanooga.
This regiment was in rather striking
contrast to the cavalry regiment, being
fully uniformed and armed with Win
chester rifles. They were brought Im
mediately to this point and reported to
General Brooke. They will sleep in
their cars to-night and to-morrow
morning will pitch their tents.
Three Persons Drowned.
BALTIMORE. Md., May 15.â Edward
Wentz, 36 years of age, his little daugh
ter, Lulu, 4 years old, of this city, and
Mlbs Lucy Plugrath of Chicago, were
drowned In Round Bay to-day by the cap
sizing of a sail boat.
SPANISH GUNBOAT
TAKEN AT MANILA
Callao Steamed Into the Bay and Promptly Fell
Into the Hands of Admiral
Dewey.
HONGKONG, May 15.â The United States dispatch boat Hugh Mc-
Culloch arrived here from Manila with dispatches for the United
States Government. She reports that the Spanish gunboat Callao
from the Caroline Islands recently entered the port of Manila, being ig
norant of the outbreak of hostilities between Spain and the United
States. An American warship fired across her bows and signaled her a
demand to surrender. The demand being disregarded, the American
ship fired direct at the Spanish gunboat, and the latter surrendered.
The populace of Manila is reduced to eating horse flesh, and the
prospect for relief seems far distant.
The Hugh McCulloch also reports that the Philippine insurgents ap
plied to Rear Admiral Dewey for his approval of an attack by them
upon the c!ty. The Admiral, It appears, approved of the plan, pro
vided no excesses were committed. The insurgents then pleaded that
they had no arms with the exception of machetes, to which the Ad
miral replid: "Help yourselves at the Cavite arsenal."
The city of Manila, however, has not yet been attacked. About
5000 Spanish troops are guarding the road leading from Cavite to Ma
nila,
There is no truth in the reported massacre of a number of Ameri
cans. There has been recently a trifling incident during police duty
and nobody was hurt.
' WASHINGTON, May 15. â Admiral Dewey has sent the following
to Secretary Long:
CAVITE, Kay 13 (via Hongkong, May 15).â Maintaining strict block
ade. Reason to believe that the rebels are hemrair"- in the city by land,
but have made no demonstration. Scarcity of provisions in Manila.
Probable that the Spanish Governor will be obliged to surrender soon.

When Aid Comes From This

Spaniards Seizs Relief Supplies, and

"Weyler's Chickens."
Special Dispatch to The Coll.
KEY WEST, May 15.â The conditions
in Havana resulting from the blockade
are being gradually brought out by in
formation obtained from fishing smacks
and other small vessels captured off the
coast. i
Affairs at Havana now appear to be
worse than at any time since the Wey
ler regime. The fishermen who at first
braved the blockade for the high price
which fish brought in Havana, now run
the risk not for money, but for food.
A number of these have been captured
by the vessels of the blockading fleet,
nearly all of them being released after
having been questioned by our officers.
They all unite in picturing the state of
affairs at Havana as being pitiful in the
extreme.
The Machias caught two fishing boats
accumulated all the facts obtainable
along the blockading line, the latest
news being obtained through two cap
tures made by the United States gun
boat Machias, which has just returned
here for the first time since the block
ade opened, making the longest single
service of any blockading vessels off
Cuba.
Th Machias caught two fishing boats
off Havana, just before her return.
The Americans offered the fishermen
money for part of their catch, as the
fish were needed on board. But the
fishermen demurred at taking money,
they preferring to have bread, and add
ing that they were desperately hungry.
When questioned as to the prevalence
of yellow fever at Havana, the fishermen
said there was little sickness at the
.Cuban capital, but they added there
'was much starvation. The reconcen
trados, they said, were nearly all dead,
or have been expelled from the city to
die in the suburbs.
This agrees with other reports from
Havana and Matanzas, to the effect
that the Spanish authorities on the de
parture of the American Consul, seized
all the relief supplies and applied them
the uses of the army. The Span
ish then drove the reconcentrados
.into the desolated sections of
the country between the coast towns
and the insurgent lines, the regions de
scribed by Senator Proctor and other?
as being too barren and desolate to sup
port grasshoppers.
The insurgents themselves have been
chary of receiving reconcentrados, and
hundreds of the latter who had no per
sonal friends in the insurgent camps
had been left to starve between the
lines.
About Havana the situation is even
worse. Hundreds of reconoentrados
from Los Fosoe, the big reconcentrados'
barracks in Havana, were too weak to
walk out of town, and fell in the streets
or died in the suburbs, where flocks of
vultures â "Weyler's chickens." as they
are now termed in Havanaâ have
feasted on the remains.
In Matanzas the feature of the situa
tion is equally distressing.
1 The fishermen who have been brought
here are soon reconciled to capture*,
which mpans food and decent treot
ment. They say that if the blockade
continues much longer bread riots must
follow in all the large towns, as food Is
reserved exclusively for the army, thus
forcing many people to enlist who
would not otherwise do so. Finally. thÂ«
fishermen say that certain Spaniards
threaten to burn Havana or blow the
city up in the event of the authorities
deciding to capitulate to the American
forces. _______________

KEY WEST, May 15.â This has been
a Sunday of unusual activity here, and
it is apparent that an important strate

modore Watson arrived on the gunboat
Dolphin from the blockading fleet off
Havana. Orders came thick and fast
from Washington, and the naval sta
tion authorities were instructed to

The ships already in the harbor have
been ordered to get up steam without

SANTA ROSA, May 15.â 8y to-mor
row evening the delegates to the grand
lodges of the Knights of Pythias and
Rathbone Sisters will all have arrived
in this city, and shortly after the com
ing of the evening trains the week's j
festivities will begin. The elaborate !
arrangements made for the entertain
ment of the guests seem to have taken
the early arrivals somewhat by sur
prise, and several of the chief officers
of the Grand Lodge, who came yester
day, have expressed in no uncertain
terms their appreciation of the exten
sive programme arranged for the dele
gates and visitors during the week.
It Is not often that the delegates to a
State meeting have the opportunity of
enjoying an elaborate rose carnival as
part of the entertainment offered for
their amusement, and that is what the
visitors in this city will be given. For
this reason and for the further fact
that there will be but one rose carnival
held in the entire State this season, the
list of delegates and visitors who will
attend the coming session of the grand
lodges will undoubtedly be the largest
known to the history of the order, while
the number of outsiders usually at
tending the annual rose carnival in
Santa Rosa gives promise of exceeding
all previous records.
The main body of delegates to the
grand lodges of the two orders will ar
rive on Monday evening's trains, and
the moment they alight from the cars
they will be taken in charge by the re
ception committee and marched to the
general headquarters, where they will
be assigned to rooms in different parts
of the city. Parks' Santa Rosa band
will meet those arriving on the San
Francisco and North Pacific Railway,
while the Pythian band, especially de
tailed from Camp Hahman, where the j
Uniform Rank will be located in a
great city of tents, will greet those I
coming- in over the Southern Pacific.
When the shades of evening have set- j
tled over the city an open-air concert 1
will be given from the portico of the ]
Courthouse, and this will be the enter
tainment provided for the visitors for
that evening. On Tuesday morning the
session of both grand lodges will be
called to order and the business of the
Meek will begin. The city is already
gay with bunting, flags and streamers,
and on every hand are noted the hurry
and bustle usually consequent upon a
city's donning the finishing touches of
her holiday attire.
Camp Hahman is already in shape to
accommodate the members of the Uni
form Rank, who will spend the entire
week in camp. Brigadier General 14c-

great fir trees make a charming back
ground for the snow-white tents and at
night the grounds will be brightly il
luminated, by thousands of Chinese
lanterns. These will be strung in and
out among the trees, and high into the
tops of giant oaks, and the scene will
doubtless be one of marvelous beauty.

THE SA!N FRAKCISCO CALL, MOKDAY, MAY 16, IS9B.
IS A WARNING
TO ALL EUROPE
Mr. Chamberlain's Speech
Pleases American
Statesmen.
Will Increase the Friendship
of the Anglo-Saxon
Nations.
Belief That England Would Prevent
Interference by Continental
Powers,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, May 15.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
Senators and Representatives are all
much pleased with the attitude of Eng
land in the Spanish-American war, as
expressed by Mr. Joseph Chamberlain
in his speech on public affairs in Bir
mingham. Members of the Senate For
eign Relations Committee as atrule are
not inclined to speak for publication at
the present time on the exact action
the United States might take to further
an Anglo-Saxon alliance, as suggested
by Mr. Chamberlain. They were, how
ever, of the opinion that Mr. Chamber
lain's speech strongly intimated that
the sympathies of Great Britain were
with America in her present struggle.
Senator Cullom of the Foreign Rela
tions Committee said in regard to the
spoech of Mr. Chamberlain:
"It was a most wonderful speech in
every way, and we are all very glad
to hear such words of good feeling
come from one- of the leading English
statesmen. It will have the Important
effect of keeping either France, Ger
many or Austria from showing outward
sympathy for Spain, and will tend to
bring the two English-speaking nations
together.
"Those countries," said Senator Cul
lom in speaking of the action of France
and Austria in the present struggle be
tween the United States and Spain,
"had better mind their own business
or they will get more than they bar
gain for."
Senator Foraker was much pleased
with the speech of Mr. Chamberlain,
but would say nothing for publication,
except that he thought it would act aa
a warning to European powers to keep
out of the existing war and remain
strictly neutral.
2.la ny public men who are reluctant
to talk for publication at present ex
pressed themselves as believing that in
case of any interference from France
or any other European power, England,
if necessary, would enter actively into
the struggle as an ally of the United
States.
Senator Thomas C. Platt seldom be
comes enthusiastic over foreign affairs,
but he did not hesitate to announce
his cordial appreciation of the senti
ments expressed by Mr. Chamberlain.
MADRID, May 15.â "With reference
to the speech of Mr. Joseph Chamber
lain, the British Secretary of State for
the Colonies, at Birmingham on Friday
night, Senor Gullon said it had real im
portance, not only for Spain, but for
the future of Europe. He declared also
that a red book would be presented to
the Chamber on Wednesday next, in
which the Government declares the
blockade of Cuba ineffective, and ex
presses the hope that the powers in
Europe and America will refuse to
recognize it.
WAR REVENUE BILL
BEFORE THE SENATE.
WASHINGTON, May 15.â The war reve
nue bill will occupy the attention of the
Senate this week almost to the exclusion
of other business, and there is a proba
bility that the bill can be disposed of
during the week. The indications now
are for a two weeks' debate, and there
is no assurance that it will be concluded
within that period* of time. The oppo
nents of the bill disavow any intention to
delay the action of this legislation, but
they do not conceal their purpose of tak
ing time to present their views on the
various questions Involved, and it looks
as if it would be impossible for them to
do this within less time than two weeks.
The principal portion of the debate will
be on the report of the Republican mem
bers of the committee In favor of restor
ing the bond provision. The probabili
ties are that this proposition will prevail
if the war continues, but before a vote
can be reached upon it there will be a
great deal of talk for and against it. The
entire financial question will be involved
to an extent, and probably most of the
Senators who oppose the bond issue will
be heard before the conclusion of the dis
cussion. The Republican Senators gen
erally are averse to a prolonged discus-
Bion, but the Democrats and silver Re
publicans say it will be necessary for
them to explain and defend their position.
Senator Allison will open the debate on
Monday with a statement, on behalf of
the Republican members of the Comraft
tee on Finance, and will be followed by
some Democratic member of the com
mittee, probably Senator Jones. Beyond
this there is no date upon which to base
a statement of the probabilities. It is
quite certain, however, that there will
be no dearth of speechmakers nor of
FORSAKE THEIR
POSTS OF DUTY
Members of the Spanish
Cabinet Tender Their
Resignations.
To Sagasta Will Fall the Task
of Forming a New
Ministry.
Official Announcement That the War
Will Be Prosecuted to thÂ»
Bitter End.
Special Dispatch to The CÂ»ll.
MADRID, May 15, via Paris.â The
members of the Spanish Cabinet have
resigned. Senor Sagasta will commu
nicate the situation to the Queen Re
gent, who will entrust him with the
task of forming a new Ministry.
It is officially declared that the new
Ministry, when formed, will continue
to prosecute the war to the utmost.
The Cabinet was composed as fol
lows:
President of the Council, Senor Sa
gasta.
Minister of Foreign Affairs. Senor
Gullon.
Minister of Justice. Senor Groizard.
Minister of Finance, Senor Puigecer
ver.
Minister of the Interior, Senor Cape
don.
Minister of War, General Correa.
Minister of Marine, Admiral Bermejo.
Minister of Agriculture and Com
merce and of Public Works, Count
Xiquena.
Minister of the Colonies, Senor Moret.
A Cabinet council this evening ter
minated at 9:30 o'clock. A Minister j
who was interviewed on the situation,
declared that nothing definite had been
decided upon as to the changes in the
Cabinet, pending a conference between
the Queen Kegent and Senor Sagasta.
The Liberal Cabinet under Senor Sa- j
gasta was formed shortly after the as-
sassination of Senor Canovas del Cas
tillo, who was assassinated August 8,
1897, by an Italian anarchist named
Golli. General Azcarraga, then Minis
ter of War, was first appointed Presi
dent of the Council, and for a time the
Cabinet remained unchanged. But on
September 20 it resigned and Senor Sa
gasta assumed office October 4, con
fronted by the troubles in Cuba and in
the Philippine Islands. One of the first
steps taken by Senor Sagasta was to
recall General Weyler, then captain
general of Cuba, who was succeeded by
General Blanco. But the situation did
not improve, and Spain was courteous
ly, but firmly, warned that the United
States could not much longer maintain
neutrality in the face of the terri-ble sit
uation of affairÃ in Cuba and the dam
ages which American interests were
suffering therefrom. Spain, however,
refused to regard the situation from a
humanitarian and business-like stand
point and diplomatic relations with the
United States were broken off April 21
last.
Even then there were rumors of trou
ble in the Spanish Cabinet, and after
the brilliant victory of the United
States fleet under Commodore Dewey
on May 1 the situation became more
and more strained. The Minister of
Marine, Admiral Bermejo; the Minister
of War, General Correa, and especially
the Minister for the Colonies, were re
peatedly attacked in Parliament. In
and out of it rumors of resignations
tendered or to be tendered have been
circulating for the past week or two.
The difficulty, it appears, is to find
men who are willing to assume office
under the conditions which now prevail
in Spain. An empty treasury, internal
disorders and the loss of the Philippine
Islands, Cuba and Porto Rico are not
the only problems confronting Spanish
Ministers, and it is not astonishing
that, under the circumstances, a mili
tary dictatorship under, possibly. Mar
shal Martinez de Campos has been dis
cussed.
MADRID, May 15â11:30 p. m.â It is
now believed that only Admiral Ber
mejo, Minister of Marine, and Count
Xiquena, Minister of Public Works, will
quit the Cabinet.
LONDON, May 15.â A dispatch to the
Times from Madrid, which will be pub
lished to-morrow, confirms the official
denial at the Spanish capital that the
Cabinet changes are connected with a
peace movement. The Times' corre
spondent says:
"The conclusion to be drawn from the
reorganization that they are seeking a
peaceable solution of the question, has,
for the moment, been abandoned, and
the war will be prosecuted vigorously.
There was a prolonged Cabinet council
this afternoon, dealing with the crisis,
and several points were practically set
tled. Senor Saeasta. though weak in
health, remains President of the Coun
cil of Ministers, because the Liberals
are In a majority in the Chamber, and
it would be inconvenient to have a
Cabinet chief, however distinguished,
who is not chief of the Liberal party.
"Four Ministersâ Renors Gullon, Ber
mejo, Moret and Xiquenaâ will retire,
partly for personal reasons, and partly
because of differences on important
policies. Senor Saerasta will choose the
strongest Liberals he can find, but sev
eral of the strongest, notably Senor
Gamazo, have intimated that they will
not take office at present.
"It Is hoped and expected that Gen
eral Correa, who has valuable qualifica
tions for his present position, will re
main."
DISASTER PURSUES
STICKEEN ARGONAUTS
VANCOUVER, B. C, May 15.âAccord
ing to passengers on the steamship
Athenian, which reached port from the
north to-day, disaster ahd death are fol
lowing closely the argonauts who left
here recently to go into the gold country
by the Stickeen River Almost a dozen
hardy men who attempted the impossible
feat of going up the swift river in small
boats came down on the steamer and will
go into the interior by way of Skaguay.
They tell of about 1000 unfortunates
stalled on the river. Their supplies are
cached for miles and tney are unable to
reach Glenora, owing to lack of funds tp
take them up on steamers
J D Murray, an Australian miner, is
one of the returned argonauts. He left
with a party of four, and when fifty
miles up the river tneir boat, containing
their outfits, capsized. Just prior to the
disaster each man In the party removed
his money belt, and $3000 which they car
ried in this way was lost.
Murray says that a number of people
attempting the trip in small boats have
lost their lives.
On his trip down he saw the Indian
Chief Tanlan, a well-known packer of
Wrangel, lose his life in attempting to
take a towline to shore in his canoe. The
chief's death was tragic. He was a
powerful swimmer, but the icy waters
cramped him, and just before he sank he
uttered the familiar tribe cry and stoic
ally waved a good-by to a hundred peo
ple on shore, who were unable to help
him. â, .
The steamer Romona, Mr. Murray says,
broke her paddle-wheel and was disabled
on the first trip up the river, and the
Courser had the bad luck to get. her en
gines disabled. Both accidents occurred
near Glenora. It is said the Courser
mishap is more serious than was reported,
and that owing to the light pressure the
side of the boiler blew out and two men
were hurt.
FIRE'S HAVOC
AT KINGMAN
Business Section of the
Arizona Town De
stroyed.
Spread of the Conflagration
Aided by a Strong
Wind.
Many People Rendered Homeless
and Dependent on Neigh
bora' Charity.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
KINGMAN, Ariz., May 15.â One of
the most disastrous fires in the history
of Kingman originated in the White
Hills Mining Company's warehouses
near the Santa Fe railway tracks at
5:30 o'clock this evening. The building
was soon in iiames and the blaze com
municated to the two large warehouses
of Gaddis & Perry. Then, driven by a
strong wind from the south, it spread
to the opposite side of the street, en
veloping brick and wooden business
blocks.
The Hubbs House, a two-story
wooden structure, was probably the
first to ignite. Then it was the work
of a moment for the blaze to continue
its advance to the saloons of E. F.
Thompson, Andrew Laswell and Mul
ligan & Hubbs and on down the street,
laying in waste restaurants and shops,
to the saloon of Price Thompson and
the large livery stable and fine new
residence of George M. Bowers. These
destroyed, the flames spread across the
alley to many residences, leaving noth
ing but blackened and smoking ruins.
All or nearly all of the losers carried
insurance, except the small trades peo
ple, but the exact figures cannot be had
to-night.
The W. H. Taggart Mercantile Com
pany owned one end of the White Hills
Company's warehouse as a refrigerator
and fruit storage. Mr. Taggart said to
night that their loss would be trivial,
although they carried no insurance.
The two-story brick building on the
corner of Front and Fourth streets was
saved with but little loss to the second
floor, on which was the Odd Fellows'
and Knights of Pythias Halls.
Many families are homeless to-night
and are seeking shelter wherever they
can get It.

MADERA, May 15. â A joint convention
of the Democratic and Populist parties of
this county was held in Madera yester
day for the purpose of effecting a fusion
for the coming general election. Dele
gates from the various voting precincts
of the county were present, and the day
was consumed in a vain endeavor to
effect the desired union. The Democrats
claim the Populists "wanted the earth."
The convention disbanded late in the
afternoon without achieving anything in
the fusion line, and as the action of the
two parties is said to be tinal, both will,
in all probability, place tickets in the
field. The Democratic convention while
In session unanimously adopted a resolu
tion indorsing Judge W. M. Conley for
the position of Associate Justice of the
Supreme Court of this State,
ITALIAN RIOTS MAY

Probable Resignation of the Cabinet,
With Signor Sonnino as the
Next Premier.
LONDON, May 16.â According to u.s
patches from various parts of Italy,
Rome, Milan and the other large towns
continue quiet, but it is understood that
the state of siege will be maintained until
Parliament has adopted the necessary re
piessive measures.
All horse races at Milan have been
stopped for three months. Altogether,
six members of the Chamber of Deputies
have b^en imprisoned, and there have
been 300 arrests in Rome alone.
It Is believed that the agitation will
result in the resignation of the Cabinet,
with Signor Sonnino as the next Premier.

WE ARE STILL DOING BUSINESS.
THE war goes on, and so does business, much
to the surprise of a good many worthy but
timid and over-conservative people who pre
dicted all sorts of mishaps to trade coincident with
the embarkation of the country in a foreign war.
Everybody has met these cautious folk, and every
body remembers their doleful predictions. The war
was going to cost a deal of money; foreign compli
cat'ors would probably ensue; taxes would be tre
mendously increased; money would gÂ»t tight, business
would be paralyzed, and the poor would suffer. The
country would not get over it for a generation, and
things generally would go to the bowwows. These
timid people are always with us; they always sec the
lion in the path, but alas for their apprehensions!
the war has been under full steam for some little
time, a large fleet has been destroyed, fortifications
have been battered down in the Occident and Orient,
the map of the world is undergoing important
changes, and yet a stranger could travel from New
York to San Francisco and see no signs of a foreign
war, provided he could be kept away from the news
papers. On all sides, wherever he went, he would
see a great nation plodding along peacefully in the
universal occupation of making money.
Of course there have been changes, but thus far
the)- are insignificant. As remarked several weeks
ago, those articles directly affected by a foreign war
have advanced, but nine out of ten of the common
lines of trade remain absolutely unaffected. As far
as business is concerned, the war is an incident, not
half as serious or important as the dry season.
Generally speaking, trade is quiet and devoid of
feature. Iron, which was .abnormally active for a
year, has quieted down, owing largely to the immense
production, which is placed at a million tons a
month. Wool, per contra, which has been stagnant
for many months, is showing increased activity.
Groceries and food products have again advanced
as a rule, in consequence of the remarkable rise in
wheat, which is in light supply all over the world.
The bank clearings last week again showed a marked
gain, being 37.6 per cent over those for the same
week in 1897, which indicates that business is just
that percentage better this year than last, the horrible
war to the contrary notwithstanding. The failures,
too, make a good exhibit, showing liabilities of $2,
978,980, against $3,995,894 last year and $4,138,271 in
1896. Money is easier, with increased loans at lower
rates of interest, and the Government is actually pay
ing out gold over its Treasury counter because it
needs notes more than coin. As an effect of this
dreadful war this latter condition is positively refresh
ing. The truth is, the nation has lately been rather
surfeited with gold from foreign countries, and there
is still more to come â something like $11,000,000 in
actual coin. Nor must it be forgotten that we have
recently been loaning money to Europe. All this is
respectfully submitted to the consideration of the
aforesaid good folk who predicted hard times.
Locally there h little new to report in the con
dition of trade. The farmer continues on top, as
his products are commanding better prices than he
has enjoyed for a number of years. Some districts
have suffered more or less from lack of rain, and
a few severely; but the northern half of the State, at
least, will go through the year with flying colors.
Even here crops of all kinds will be short, but the 'â 
sharp advance in prices will offset the deficiency in
the yield. At the eleventh hour we are favored with
a gentle rain which may catch some hay out napping
and split a few cherries here and there, but which
trill enormously benefit all grain and hay still uncut, j
so it is more of a blessing than otherwise. The fruit
interest, from present indications, will make money j
this year, as the crop will not be large, except in one
or two varieties, such as prunes, for instance, and :
buyers are already in the field bidding fancy prices
for cling peaches and pricots â $60 per ton being '
named for both kinds. These figures are pretty steep, !
and it is doubtful whether the heavy buyers will pay |
them.
Europe is going to unnecessary trouble in worry
ing about the passing of the Philippines into the
possession of England. This country is friendly to
England, but Tias no present intention of turning^ over
to her such chestnuts as may be dragged from the
fire during the war.
If members of the late Grand Jury can only get
over their sulks they will find that private life has
many pleasing features.
If the sewer system sojith of the park shall turn out
to be worth all that is being paid for it, it can hardly
be less than perfect.
MORE TALK OF INTERVENTION.
SECRETARY CHAMBERLAIN'S plain decla
ration at Birmingham that the policy of the
Salisbury ministry is to isolate Great Britain
from European combinations and seek an alliance
with the Unijed States, has been followed by a story
to the effect that certain European powers recently
requested the British Government to act in concert
with them for the purpose of localizing the war be
tween the United States and Spain to the West Indies
and preventing our continued occupation of the Phil
ippines. This request the British are said to have
refused, and it is added they gave the Continental
powers to understand that any interference on their
part against the United States would be followed by
the prompt intervention of Great Britain on our
side.
If this story be true we owe the British some
thanks for their display of friendship, and yet we are
not wholly grateful. We would have preferred to
have had them stand neutral for a while and wait to
see what would happen when the first step of inter
ference was taken. The people of the United States
are not carrying a chip on their shoulders, but they
are somewhat eagerly awaiting just such an action as
that proposed. Our Government has In a diplo
matic way informed Europe that no intervention in
the war would be permitted, and we would now
gladly welcome an occasion for making the informa
tion more specific and emphatic by applying it in
the case of a direct attempt to intervene.
Doubtless it would please Europe to have the war
confined to American waters, but we prefer to carry
it wherever we can find the foe. We have sent our
fleets to Manila and we may yet send them to Europe
itself for the purposes of attacking Spain at home,
it is our war and we will wage it as we think best.
When we choose to have intervention we will ask
for it, and any power or combination of powers that
offers it before we ask will meet with a rebuff that
will surprise them as much as Cleveland's Venezu
elan message surprised Great Britain.
If the war with Spain causes complications in the
Orient of elsewhere that so disturb European pride
as to lead to a general war, we would, of course, be
glad of the help the British have it in their power
to give. It would be of great advantage to us to have
our coasts guarded by her dominating fleet until we
could build up our own. We are thankful, there
fore, that such help is promised by a member of the
British Cabinet, and that the promise was greeted
with approving cheers by the British audience that
heard it. We are not so thankful, however, that the
proposed interference was checked. Sooner or later
it will be necessary to make the European powers
clearly understand the claim of the United States to
bo able to attend to her own business in peace or
war, and this is about as good a time as any to give
the understanding.
OUR INTERESTS IN ChJINA.
SOME time ago it was decided by the Philadel
phia Commercial Museum to 6end to China a
commission charged with the duty of investi
gating the conditions of the different provinces of
that country with a view to increasing our commercial
relations with them. The outbreak of the war does
not appear to have interfered with the project, and
accordingly the commissioners will probably soon set
out on their undertaking.
The object of the commission, while of great im
portance to the Union generally, is particularly so
to the Pacific Coast. In the very nature of things
our commercial expansion must be largely in the
direction of China. We can hardly hope to have any
considerable increase of demand from the East for
our manufactured goods, or, indeed, for goods of
any kind except fruit, oil and wine, by reason of the
fact that the East produces itself more than it can
consume of such articles. Moreover in sending
freight to the East high railroad rates so increase the
cost of our products after they arrive at those mar
kets that they cannot compete with those of the East
ern producer.
In China a different set of conditions prevail. We
have cheap ocean transportation to Chinese ports,
and in this have an advantage over any American
competitor, while the proximity of China to this
coast when compared with the long distance from
Europe gives us an advantage over European com
petition. Thus the geographical situation of the
Chinese ports with relation to our own and those
of other civilized nations is in our favor, and we
ought to find there a profitable market for all such
goods as the Chinese obtain from foreign countries.
As China advances from her long seclusion into
closer relations with the rest of the world there in
creases a demand for the products of civilization. Her
people are beginning to consume large quantities
and a great variety of manufactured articles. The
demand for cotton cloths, clocks, bicycles, and all
kinds of hardware and agricultural implements is
rapidly increasing. Moreover there is a growing de
sire arriong the Chinese people for wheat and for
canned fruits. We can supply much of this demand,
and, therefore, have a material interest in the com
merce of the country.
The proposed commission, while organized by the
Philadelphia Museum, will travel under authority of
the State Department and will represent the whole
country. It will look after our interests as well as
those of the Eastern States. We have a right, there
fore, to expect good results from it. All the great
commercial nations of the globe: Great Britain, Rus
sia, Germany and France, are struggling for suprem
acy in the Chinese market. The United States is not
likely to imitate them in seizing Chinese territory,
but it cannot permit them to interfere with our com
mercial interests, and it is, therefore, timely and op
portune to assert our claims and develop our trade
with all the Chinese provinces where there is any
considerable demand for articles produced by either
our fields or our mills.
It must be conceded that the Creelmans and
Deckers of the yellow press have Spanish rivals in the
art of lying. But the work of the Spanish is raw yet,
though improving. Their fabrications are really as
harmless as the tales of a Munchausen. The more
practiced liars tell that which might be true, and
sometimes have the joy of noting that for an hour or
two their- yarns are believed.
Doctors are blaming the cigarette for the many
rejections of volunteers, and probably the cigarette is
as guilty as half a dozen other things. If anybody
entertains the idea that the men who passed do not
indulge in this form of attempted suicide he has only
to visit the military camp and incautiously display a
package of the little rolls tÂ© be undeceived.
Some regret is expressed that Sampson failed to
destroy the coal Spain has stored at San Juan. But
cheer abides in the thought that that coal will burn
well under the boiler of American men-of-war.

THE SAN iTBAyCISOQ CALL, MONDAY, MAY 16, 1898.
THE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER.
ACCORDING to an estimate made by John
Wanamaker, the people of the United States
have within the last twenty days expended over
$2,000,000 in the purchase of national fla.gs,' and the
demand is still going on at an increasing rate. The
purchasers come from every section of the Union â
from the South as well as the North â the whole land
is becoming radiant with banners.
The flags ordered are of all sizes and fitted for all
purposes that ardent loyalty can devise. They are to
float from barracks and arsenals, from schoolhouses
and colleges, from stores, offices and shops, from
liberty poles in rural villages, from city homes and
farm houses, and not infrequently from smÂ«ill staffs
which can be carried in the hand for ready waving
whenever the passing of volunteers or other patriotic
incident affords an opportunity to the citizen to show
his colors.
Nor is it in our own land only that the Star
Spangled Banner is brightening the breeze with a
greater frequency than ever. It is streaming now
in the Orient from the masts of Dewey's squadron,
and floats above the Philippines with the pride of
conquest and possession. While it floats there as an
emblem of American sovereignty over those islands,
it rivals the proud banner of Great Britain in meet
ing the sun at every hour of the journey of that orb
around the globe. Before the descending stin sets
upon the starry banner at Manila its rising beams
catch sight of the innumerable flags that fly along the
Atlantic from Maine to Porto Rico.
In this exuberance of the flag there is a significance
greater than that of individual patriotism, for a great
national aspiration can never be measured by per
sonal feeling, no matter how intense that feeling may
be or how strong the personality of the individual.
The people have been once more aroused to a sense
of the manifest destiny which overrides individual
inclinations and shapes the onward course of the
great republic. Whether flying from the peaceful
schoolhouse of an inland State or from & warship
riding a far off sea and dominating a hostile port, the
flag carries the same meaning for nations and for
humanity. It marks the advance of a power in the
world with which all will hereafter have to reckon
in every crisis that affects the larger destinies of man
kind.
There can be little doubt in the minds of any who
are at all familiar either with our history or with
our people, as to what is the significance of the ad
vancing banner, or what will be its influence among
nations. The flag carries its meaning with it. A3
has been said by an orator not given to vain declama
tion f "Look at it. Listen to it. Every star has a
tongue, every stripe is articulate." It proclaims that
which from the earliest days of the republic has been
borne as a legend upon the reverse of the great seal
of the nation. "Novum ordo saeculorum" (a new
order of the ages), and "The heavens approve."
FRENCH SYMPATHY WITH AMERICA.
POPULAR opinion in this country is about per
suaded that French sympathy is almost wholly
on the side of Spain and against us in the
present war. This conclusion is founded on reports
of articles in the Parisian press, telegraphed to the
United States, and to that extent is fully justified.
It appears, however, that the press of Paris does not
thoroughly represent France, and that we have among
the French a body of sympathizers, less noisy but
not less strong than that which so vociferously up
holds the Spanish.
A large number of persons of French birth or
descent are residents of the United States, and all of
them have a greater or less number of relatives or
friends in France. It is inevitable that the influence
of the American French should be felt in the old
country, and.it is the stronger because of the senti
mental tie which has bound the people of the two
nations together through the memory of the aid
given by France to the United States in the days of
the revolution.
There is another motive, less lofty and less senti
mental which inclines the French to hold friendly
elations with tts. It springs from the desire of all
classes of the people to make the international ex
position of iooo a complete triumph from every point
of view, and that could hardly be accomplished if the
United States were antagonized to such an extent
as to induce her citizens to ignore the enterprise and
take no part in it. We have, therefore, a sympathy
arising from the pocketbook as well as one of the
heart, and the two combined constitute a force of
sentiment hardly less potent than that which con
trols the Parisian press.
The instincts of the French people as a mass are
always on the side of humanity and liberty. They
are too proud of the glorious achievements of their
revolution to have a natural sympathy with a des
potic monarchy against a struggling people, and,
therefore, under ordinary circumstances would sup
port the United States in its efforts to establish the
independence of Cuba and the liberty of its people.
It happens, however, that a large number of French
capitalists hold Spanish bonds, and these have been
powerful enough to induce the newspapers of
Paris to misrepresent the issue. Thus a false im
pression is given to the people of bofli countries. We
are persuaded that the French people regard us with
hostility, and the French are persuaded that we are
a nation of aggressive bullies seeking to deprive Spain
of her territory for the gratification of a greed for
conquest.
Sooner or later these misconceptions will pass
away from both sides. Our cause is so just that no
civilized people can long refrain from sympathizing
with its objects. Nor will the American people re
main for any great time under the impression that the
democratic instincts of France have been subverted
by a new born love for Spanish monarchy, or by a
commercial interest in Spanish bonds. The French
press is brilliant and potent, but it is not France.
At last ex-Banker Spalding of Chicago is in the
penitentiary. To get him there consumed more time
than should have been devoted to the purpose. He
rests under the uncertain doom of an "indetermin- j
ate" sentence. . What this may be is not understood
out here, but it is probably something which will last
until some tender-hearted Governor happens to be
in power.
There is some talk of a second call for volunteers,
and if it come the response will be as prompt and
enthusiastic as it was to the first.
The boys in camp at the Presidio would have had
everything they needed if San Francisco had under
stood in advance that it was being depended upon
to supply it. Now the people of the city are devot
ing their energies to catching up.
By killing the men on the Winslow the Spanish
have added to a long score which they are destined
to pay with interest.
The action of a suspected Spanish spy in Washing
ton in hanging himself will be accept Â« a olea of
guilty.
DESTINY OF THE PHILIPPINES.
The victorious guns of the American fleet have closed one chapter of our
national history and opened another. The destiny of the Philippines is not to be
decided in a moment or prematurely determined, but whatever the decision and
whatever the determination the United States must decide and determine. No
other nation can. This responsibility we cannot divide. Leaving the considera
tion of merely American conditions and abandoning circumstances and an en
vironment limited to thiÃ hemisphere, the United States is forced to step upon
the world's stage 4nd to deal with the world's problems.â Philadelphia Press.
ARE WELL WORTH KEEPING.
With the flag planted by Commodore Dewey flying over the city of Manila,
the Philippine Islands are a possession of the United States as rightly and legally
as any State or Territory- We do not know much about our new possessions in
the far Pacific, but what little we do know indicates that they are of great value.
What we shall do with the Philippines ought not to offer a very serious problem
when their possession is unquestionable. They are certainly well worth keeping,
if we do not care to do anything else with them.â Providence News.
SCHEME OF COLONIAL POLICY.
Give Cutra her freedom, sell the Philippines and hold Porto Rico would Beem
to be the proper disposition of the possessions which Spain must forfeit to the
United States on account of the war. The Philippines we do not want, certainly
not If they can be sold to either Japan or some other power for a sufficient sum
to pay a large share of the expenses of the war.â Minneapolis Journal.
HAMPERED BY NO PLEDGES.
Undoubtedly, the case of the Philippines is different from the case of Cuba.
The United States is pledged not to keep Cuba for its own, and to stay only till
Spain has been put out of the island and until the Cubans have established a
government. With regard to Porto Rico, if we take it, and with regard to the
Philippines, we are under no such pledge. We are under no obligation, formal
or implied, to abandon the Philippines at the conclusion of the war.â Milwaukee
Sentinel.
A VALUABLE ACQUISITION.
Such a territorial acquisition would more than Indemnify us for a much
greater war than any we would be called upon to wage against a weak and
rotten State like Spain. It may be said, however, as to the ledger account,
that we shall take and keep the rich little island of Porto Rico to boot.âWash

If holding and governing a country were equivalent to controlling Its trarfe and
commerce, the Philippine Islands might prove a commercial prize. The exports
of the islands in 1895 amounted to $32,000,000 and the imports to $29,000,000. Of the
exports the United States took, chiefly in sugar and hemp, the value of $4,731,366,
and furnished of the imports the inconsiderable amount of $119-855, chifly petro-
COALING STATION IN EASTERN WATERS.
The Philippines are nearly SOOO miles distant from the Pacific Coast, and
belong to another continent and to another political system, besides being inhab
ited by an alien race and one difficult to govern. The permanent retention of
Manila and Cavite as fortified coaling stations and places of refuge for American
vessels in Eastern waters is a question the solution of which will call for the
Ii Id statesman 3h 'P and diplomacy after hostilities are ended.â Chicago Times-
PLEDGE MUST BE KEPT.
When the United States undertook the war for the liberation of Cuba a pledge
was given to the civilized world that it should hot be turned into a war of ag
gression or for territorial aggrandizement.
This pledge must and will be kept. We are now in military possession of the
Philippines, and while events have thrust certain responsibilities upon us with
reference to those islands, there is nothing in the situation to justify the opinion
that we should establish our sovereignty over them. The same may be paid of
Cuba, and Porto Rico need not be acquired.â St. Louis Post-Dlspateh
DANGERS THREATEN US.
It was essential, as a military measure, that we should occupy thft Philip
pines. But it is by no means essential that we should make this occupation per
manent or that We should use it as an excuse for hoisting the American flag
oyer Hawaii, as Congress now seems inclined to do. The very fact, indeed, that
Hawaiian annexation is a probability illuminates the situation and shows ua
what dangers threaten us. There is too much reason to fear that the patriotic
enthusiasm of the moment will lead us to take steps that afterward we should
be glad to retrace.â Providence (R. I.) Journal.
TROUBLESOME POSSESSIONS.
We need now, as we needed before, coaling stations in different parts of the
world. But we do not need now any more than we did before the fight In Manila
Harbor any possessions that it would require a navy to defend. Hawaiian annex
ation is as unwise as it ever was, and the arguments against the absorption of the
Philippines arc even stronger. Of course, we ought to have a coaling station in
both these places, but there is no argument, except that of necessityâ of which
we shall speak laterâ which would warrant this Government in retaining posses
sion of the Philippines.â lndianapolis News.
COMMERCIAL CONQUEST.
It Is believed that the East offers the largest and most Inviting field for
future American commercial conquest. Our trade with China and Japan, partic
ularly In breadstuffs, has increased at a remarkable rate in the last few years,
but it is a mere bagatelle to what It might become if we made the Philippines a
busis for the development of our commerce with the Orient.
It is the value of the Philippines for this purpose rather than the richness
and productiveness of the i.slaÂ»ds themsolvts that will have greatest weight in
considering the question of their final disposition, provided we establish our claim
to them as a result of conquest.â Chicago Times-Herald.

stationed at the Presidio, but the follow
ing two are probably the best and will
serve to illustrate the greenness of the
new-jnade soldier.
The reveille, as everybody knows, Is a
genteel hint to a soldier to get up. and
yesterday morning it was being sounded
by a drummer who was a vigorous sort of
a chap, and he, imbued with the import
ance of his position and the glory at
tached to his enlistment, put in some ex
tra heavy licks, and soon the drum taps
sounded iouder and louder. He was quite
close to the tent of some recruits who
had been mustered into the service on
the day before, and presently one of
them stuck his head out of the opening
and said vehemently: "Say, for goodness
sake, old man, stop beating. that infernal
drum. How do you expect me to sleep
with all that noise?"
The second story runs like this: Lieu
tenant Neall was slowly sauntering
through the Presidio grounds when he
saw a party of some ten or twenty indi
viduals ahead of him in civilian's clothes.
They had reached a sentry (just enlisted),
who ordered them to halt in a dignified
sort of way. But the irreverent crowd
paid no attention to *im except to pass
some jocular remarks about the soldier's
appearance, and they went their way un
molested. When the lieutenant came up
to the sentry he, too, was ordered to halt,
which he accordingly did in true soldier
fashion. The young guardsman said:
"Have you got the pass word?" The lieu
tenant confessed that he had not. "Then,"
said the sentry, "you will have to go to
the guardhouse with me." The lieutenant
then said: "But I say, you didn't take
that crowd to the guardhouse." "I know
that," said the sentry, "but you are the
only man that would stop."

NEWS OP FOREIGN NAVIES.
At the beginning of May there were
under construction for the British navy
sixteen vessels in the dockyards and
seventy-nine at private yards distributed
in England and Scotland.
Three torpedo-boat destroyers recently
added to the British navy have made
good speed records. The Violet developed
a means of 6630 horse-power and 30.16
knots during three hours, the Flying Fish
iU.YI horse-power and 30.37 knots and the
Wolf 30.30 knots, all the boats steaming
continuously for three hours.
The armored cruiser Amiral de Gel
lydoa building at I'Orient is to be of
%lo tons displacement, 448 feet in length
and 63 feet beam. With three screws and
20,000 horse-power a speed of 21 knots is
calculated upon. The armor protection
is a water-line belt of six-inch Harvey
iztri steel and the armament will include
two 7.6-inch guns, carried in turrets, and
eight C.3-inch quick-firers in broadside.
The German Admiralty, in providing
for keeping up the standard of the navy,
has established the years of efficiency of
battle-ships and coast defense vessels at
twenty-live years, of large cruisers at
twenty years and of small cruisers at
fifteen years. This means that ships in
the order named having reached the
ages of 25, 20 and 15 years will have to
be discarded and new ones built to re
place the losses.
Steam trials of the French battle-ship
Brennus have been completed. They were
carried out in four series, namely: With
eight boilers, 1143 horse-poWer, a speed of
8.18 knots was obtained; under twelve
boilers, 2630 horse-power, 11.26 knots; un
der twenty-four boilers, 6229 horse-power,
14.41 knots, and with all her thirty-two
boilers at work, 13.950 horse-power, an
average speed of 17.11 knots was made
during four hours.
The German cruiser Hansa, recently
launched at Stettin, is 344 feet 8 inches
in length, 57 feet breadth and displaces
5650 tons on a draught of 21 feet 8 inches.
She is driven by triple screws, engines of
10,000 horse-power, to give a speed of
20 knots. Her normal coal supply is 500
tons, but the bunkers will stow 950 tons.
The armament is two 8.2-inch quick
firers, one placed forward and another
aft in turrets; four 5.8-inch quick-firers
in casemates and four 5.8-inch quick-firers
in small turrets. She also carries ten 3.4
inch quick-firers protected by shields and
a secondary battery of eighteen small
quick-firers.
The Spanish battle-ship Pelayo was in
dock at Toulon getting in her new boil
ers when the declaration of war necessi
tated her immediate departure. Only four
of the sixteen Niclause boilers had been
placed and pipe connections made with
the engines, but nevertheless the ship
went to sea and the other boilers were
put up and connected. In less than forty
eight hours the Pelayo had steam up
in all her boilers and proceeded with the
contractor's trial trip of four hours un
der full power, which turned out success
ful. The horse-power developed was
8000, under which a speed of 16 knots was
made, and the ship proceeded to Cadiz
for final outfit at the home dockyard.
Investigation of the manner In which
the Russian battle-ship Gangoot was
built has excited the wonder of the Ad
miralty officials that the vessel was not
lost long before she did. The ship sank
in the Bay of Bothnia about six months
ago while at target-firing: practice and
has since been raised. It is in the rivet
ing of the hull plates that the work was
most deficient and great Ingenuity dis
played to cover up bad workmanship.
In some places wooden plugs were found
instead of rivets and In other places a
composition which had hardened under
water, but which melted under the appli
cation of a lighted candle, were substi
tuted for steel rivets. The ship was built
by contract at St. Petersburg in 1890, and
the contractor Is likely to make an in
voluntary visit to Siberia, unless his ac
complices among the naval officers have
influence enough to prevent punishment
for the treasonable swindle.

Then there are the transports. A
board of army officers inspected the

found that every one of them will re

they cannot be herded between decks

MAJ. W. W. McCAMMON, A.A.G.
Among the number of army officers whose names were sent in for promo
tion by the President last week there was one who deserves more than pass
ing notice.
Line officers in every regiment in the service were selected for advance
ment in rank and appointment to staff positions, and the battalion of the
Fourteenth Infantry in camp on the Presidio plain haa thus contributed
one of its best loved and most efficient members. Captain William W. Mc-
Cammon of Company D, the second ranking officer of the battalion,
reluctantly consented yesterday to speak of his past services, that won for
him the thanks of Congress and have now gained for him the appointment
of major and assistant adjutant general. He has not received official no
tice of his appointment yet, consequently he is still serving with his regi
ment, and yesterday wag officer of the day. Seated in his tent he related
incidents of his five years' service during and after the close of the rebel
lion, and his thirty years' campaign on the plains since then.
A resident of St. Louis on the breaking out of the war, Major McCam
mon was one of the first to offer his Bervices to his country from that State.
Many of his classmates and associates believed in the doctrine of States'
rights and cast their fortunes with the South, but a letter from his father,
in which he said, "Stand by the stars and stripes, boy!" quickly determined
young McCammon.
For a time he was with the bushwhackers, but soon received the appoint
ment of first lieutenant in the Twenty-second Missouri Infantry, his bat
talion afterward being transferred to the Twenty-fourth Regiment. Shar
ing the fortunes of the Western army. Lieutenant McCammon saw plenty of
hot service at Island No. 10, New Madrid, and at Corinth.
Meantime he had been appointed captain and provost marshal of the
Third Division, Seventeenth Army Corps, and It was for his action at Corinth
in voluntarily abandoning his comparatively safe position to take command
of a body of troops, which he led into the thickest of the fight, that Con
gress presented him with a medal of honor "for most distinguished gal
lantry in action," on October S and 4, 1862.
At Oxford, Miss., Memphis, Vicksburg, Raymond, Jackson and Mission
ary Ridge Captain McCammon was in constant and perilous service, and was
made assistant adjutant general in the Fifteenth Army Corps, with the
brevet rank of major. In this capacity he served through the Atlanta cam
paign, the march to the sea, at Savannah and on up to the Potomac, par
ticipating in the final battle of the war.
After the grand review at Washington Major McCammon was appointed
adjutant general of the artillery brigade of the Fifteenth Army Corps, re
maining at Washington for some time. He was one of the eye-witnesses of
the assassination of President Lincoln and was about the first man to
reach the stage in pursuit of Booth.
From Washington Major McCammon was transferred to St. Louis,
where he assisted in massing troops for the Maximilian campaign. In Feb
ruary 1866, Major Mcoammon was honorably mustered out of the service
and remained in St. Louis for a year, during which time he engaged in jour
nalism, being connected with the Republic. But though he thought he had
laid aside his sword for all time, it was not to be. In 1867, without .solicita
tion, Major McCammon was appointed a second lieutenant in the regular
service and assigned to the Fourteenth Infantry. His regiment was then on
this coast, and he immediately started for San Francisco by way of the
Isthmus. From that time to the present he has been in constant service on
the frontier and in the Northwest.
No man in the army has been more actively engaged In suppressing hos
tile Indians than Major McCammon, his campaigns extending through al
most even' State and Territory west of the Missouri. Personally no more
popular man can be found in the army, and the pleasure of the officers and
men of his regiment at his well deserved promotion is tinctured with koen
regret that his new duties will sever his connection with the old Fourteenth.
Major McCammon is an old and warm friend of General Otis, and he hopes
that the general will appoint him to his staff for the Manila campaign. The
major came here with the expectation of participating In that expedition,
and his one fear Is that unless he goes with General Otis or General Mer
ritt he will not see much active service during the war.

welfare of the boys in blue. The sol
diers, however, did not seem to carÂ©
particularly for sympathy. They flirted
with the girls and cast contemptuous
glances at their male escorts, but- not
one of them uttered a word of com
plaint.
The First and part of the Seventh
California and the Oregon Battalion
are located on low ground, that was
soon cut up by the trampling feet into
a veritable quagmire. An abundance
of straw was provided for the tents, but
this soon became saturated and last
night the boys had anything but com
fortable beds. The Sixth California
and the Fourteenth are camped on
higher ground, and consequently es
caped in a measure, but none of them
had anything to boast of in the way of
dry and cleanly quarters.
Yesterday morning Lieutenant E. B.
Babbitt, U. S. A., of the ordnance de
partment, turned over to Colonel Smith
for the First Regiment 980 Springfield
rifles of the 1884 model and 400,000
rounds of ammunition.
The matter of locating incoming
troops at the Presidio is receiving no
little attention at the hands of the
army officers. There are about 8000 sol
diers yet to be mobilized upon the res
ervation. Lieutenant Neall said yes
terday that the troops yet to arrive
would be put in camp upon the slope
south of the Union car line. The
Spring Valley Water Company will lay
pipes so that the soldiers may be plen
tifully supplied with water. Only the
two battalions of Oregon troops yet to
come can be placed upon the cavalry
parade ground, where the troops are
now encamped; that is, provided the
First and Fourteenth are not ordered to
leave before the others arrive. The re
maining portion of the parade ground
is necessary for drill purposes. When
the Washington regiment goes into
camp it will be on the slope south of
the First California.
Lieutenant Charles H. Martin joined
the Fourteenth Infantry yesterday and
relieved Lieutenant Krauthoff, who has
been acting quartermaster and com
missary during his absence. Major
Robe has relieved Colonel Morris of the
sentry duty done by the Presidio sol
diers on post No. 1, which is where the
car line stops. He has placed his own
men on duty upon this post.
Colonel Toran of the Oregon volun
teers. Colonel Berry of the Seventh and
Colonel Johnson of the Sixth California
have received no information as to
when their commands may be expected
to leave.
Adjutant General Barrett and Colonel
Burgin of the Governor's staff visited

missions signed by the Governor.

THE CATHOLIC
AS AN AMERICAN
Father Yorke Again Arraigns
Himself Against
Bigotry.
Ha Lectures Before a Large and En
thusiastic Audience at St.
Theresa's Church.
Father Yorke, in a lecture delivered
last evening before the parishioners of St.
Theresa's Church, attempted to draw a
parallel and a well-defined comparison
between the Catholic and Protestant
countries and the influence of religion on
political history. â¢ He began with an ex
haustive-discussion of religion generally
as allied to government. and then broad
ened Into a disquisition of the present
, political crisis between the United States
and Spain. â 
'j.ne attitude of Pope Leo in endeavor
ing to induce the latter country to ac
cede to the demands of the Americans
by bringing about a settlement of the
difficulty without resorting to the hor
rors of war as the only possible solution
was fully explained, and the speaker de
clared it to â¢ be directly opposite to the
opinion generally held, if not expressed,
that his Holiness was leaguing himself
with the Spaniards against this country.
"Pope Leo," said the lecturer, I ' "when
he : proffered his counsel and advice, had
no motive of creating ;an alliance with
Spain and against America. He foresaw
the dire effects of war and simply at
tempted to swerve the current ,of open
hostilities -. toward peace and amicable
settlement.
"The bigots who claim that he is now
using his influence on the Spanish nation
in order to spur them on to battle by
blessing the troops and Influencing the
Queen Jtiegent arc liars who ill deserve the
name of men. As long as war was brew
ing, and so long as it continued only ; a
possibility, Leo, as. the: representative of
peace, did his utmost "to avert the in- i .
evitable result; but when it became; a |
fact, and. the J President of this country
formally declared war, then whatever in
fluence he had â  exerted for peace was
brushed aside and the tide of events was
allowed to take Its course. * ''"â  â ';-â â :'â â 
"Those who have been engaged In revil
ing the Catholics and claiming that so
long as this country should tolerate tlie
existence of the â  religion in politics the
Stars and Stripes would receive but lit
tle â  respect or obedience from Catholics
because their temporal monarch was: the
Pope of Rome and their flag the cross,
are bigots who have shown their true dis
position by fleeing to a place of safety
as, soon as the tocsin was sounded,-leav
ing their flag to be fought for and hon
ored by othersâ the Catholic whom - they
would have trampled on for his disloyalty
to his adopted country.' ;
"Walk up y and down and rake thor
oughly about the tents at the Presidio
ana see whether the Catholics. will fight
for American honor and American insti
tutions. , Accost the hundreds of young
men who have * the flush of youth upon
their countenance and their whole life,
which they are about to imperil on the
battle-field, before them, and ask them
their religious belief; the general answer
Is- 'I am a son of a Catholic mother and
a Catholic father!'. The Catholics, be
fore wftr was declared, were anxious for
peace > but when the supreme head of
this ' Government decided that ;. there i was
no alternative our religion bowed under
this decision and compelled its adherents
to obey it." . . â¢* . -â¢â  _ -â â  .''â '-.â â '
The lecture was given In aid of the
church and under the auspices of , the
clergy of the parish. < -

Danmark Branch of Danish Society
Dania of California at its last held meet
ins resolved that all members in good
standing at the expense of the branch

standing at the exepense of the branch

JUMPED TO
ESCAPE ARREST
, Annie Meyer Made a Desperate
Effort to Elude the
Police.
As a Domestic She Robbed Her Em
ployers and Pawned, the
Stolen Property.
A young woman giving her name as
Annie Meyers was arrested last night by-
Detective Anthony and Policeman T. P.
Reardon after an exciting chase and
j locked up in the City Prison on a charge
of grand larceny. Several weeks ago the
woman hired out as a servant with the
| family of A. Max, at 416 McAllister street.
i During the temporary absence of the fam
ily she stole about $400 worth of jewelry
; belonging to Mrs. Max and disposed of it
;to a Third street pawn broker. She then
â  left the house, after breaking the rear
window, so as to lead Mrs. Max to be
; lieve that burglars had broken into the
house and carried off her jewelry-
Anthony and Reardon learned that she
| was living in a house at Fifth and
; Clementina streets, and last night they
I proceeded to arrest her. As they entered
! the house the woman was walking down
! stairs intending to buy a loaf of bread.
| Catching a glimpse of the officers, she
darted back into the house, followed by
them. She ran to the rear porch, and in
her desperate attempt to escape arrest
she jumped to the ground below, a dis
tance of about thirty feet. She then
scaled a high board fence and entered a
barber shop adjoining. Reardon followed
her, hiding in a closet in the rear of the
shop. How the desperate woman escaped
being injured by the jump puzzled the
officers. They say that after she struck
the ground she uttered a piercing shriek
and then fell over as if severely hurt.
The Meyers woman is well known to
[ the police. They say she is a confirmed !
thief, and that she has on several occa
sions been arrested for stealing from her
employers.
The Game Postponed.
The second innings of the Pacific vs.
Alameda match, which should have been
played yesterday at the Golden Gate
grounds, was postponed because of the
inclemency of the weather, arid will be
played next Sunday.

ARREST OF
A BRUTAL
MURDERER
Manuel de Borba Cap
tured After an Ex
citing Chase.
Found Hidden in a Closet
a Short Distance From
Baden.
Cut a Sheep Owner's Throat
During a Row in Inyo
County.
HE ADMITS HIS GUILT.
HÂ« to Brought to ThiÃ City Â»nd
Locked Up In thÂ«
Prison.
Through the efforts of Chief Lees and
his men the murderer of Mariana Can
adas, a sheep-drover, in a place called
Olancha. Inyo County. Is locked up In the
City Prison. He was arrested yesterday
afternoon at a ranch about a mile west
of Baden and brought to this city. The
prisoner gave his name as Manuel de
Borba, and his age as 21 years.
: According to Sheriff Given of Inyo
County, who assisted in the capture of
the supposed murderer, his unfortunate
victim wrote to the proprietor of the
Lisbon Hotel on Front street request ng
him to send him a man to assist in taking |
care of his sheep. The hotel proprietor (
Bpoke to Borba, who gladly accepted the
offer. The following day ne started for
Inyo County, and there he met Canadas
Ve^ha^a band of sheep with him
which he intended to drive back to his
ranch near Independence. A few days
later Canada*' mutilated body was found
partly hidden under a pile of brush. His
throat had been cut and a deep wound
In his right, hand showed that he had
vainly endeavored to defend himself
against the murderous attack of his as
*^'i.i 1 r\ ntn t
â¢ " After killing his victim de Borba drove
off the band of sheep and sold them to a
rancher some distance away from the
scene of his bloody crime. He then
walked to Lone Fine, a distance of
twenty-five miles, and remained there for
several days, when he bought a ticket !
for San Francisco. He gave his name
as Frank Johnson, and claimed that he
was on his way to this city to visit a
friend. _ _^
On arriving here he went to a Portu- >
guese settlement at San Pedro, where he ;
was given employment on a ranch.
Sheriff Given learned of his movements â â 
and at once communicated with Chief I
Lees. The latter detailed Detectives |
â Crockett and Geiman and Policeman ;
â  Peterson of the Seventeenth-street sta- \
tion to arrest the murderer. In conjunc- ;
tion with Captain of Police Seymour, the
men started out to rind de Borba. They
visited the ranch at San Pedro, but as
de Borba had been apprised that the
police were after him, he went to an
other ranch about a mile from Baden.
Yesterday morning the officers learned
of his whereabouts and proceeded to ar
rest him. He was found secreted in a
closet, and offered no resistance when
taken into custody.
Last night de Borba made a complete
confession of his crime. He claims that
he and Canadas had a row and the latter
cut him in the right leg. He then whipped
out his knife and slashed him across the
throat. Considering that he was fatally
Injured, de Borba took possession of his
sheep and subsequently sold them.
CLOSE OF THE SEASON.
Scheel Presented With Wreaths of
Silver and of Laurel by the
Symphony Society.
Yesterday afternoon the members of
the Symphony Orchestra presented to
Fritz Scheel a silver wreath as a me
mento of the successful season just
closed. On the leaves are engraved the
names of the men who have dwelt under
the rule of the leader's baton this past
year. Giulio Minetti, concert master,
made the presentation speech on behalf
of the orchestra, and Schrel responded in
German, thanking them for this evidence
of musical brotherhood. Though every
thing might not have been, during this
last year, exactly as their hearts' desire
would have had it, he said, he felt that
they had accomplished much in organiz
ing a symphony society, and he hoped for
better results in the future.
The presence of so large a gathering at
Metropolitan Temple on a day when De
cember lingered so unwelcome in the lap
of May. is evidence of the hold Scheel
has upon the musical affections of San
Francisco and an earnest of success for
next year's symphonies.
Beethoven's great Ninth Symphony, a
concert in itself, with the choral ending
Fet to Schiller's inspiring "Hymn of Joy,"
closed the programme. The allegro was
delightfully played and the adagio was
an exquisitely musical bit of symphonic
interpretation, but the scherzo lacked
that unanimity of expression which is the
soul of orchestral music. The last quar
tet was sung beautifully by Miss Flynn,
Mrs. Scarborough. Frank Coffin and Sig
nor Abramoff, and the chorus, though ln
gloriously drowned time and again by the
volume of accompaniment, did excellent
â work every time it got its vocal head
above the musical billows.
After Schubert's "Death and the
Maiden" a laurel wreath was hand
ed to the conductor, who bowed his
thanks, while the audience and the two
hundred people on the stage shouted and
applauded. H. B. Pasmore was com
pelled to repeat the whole of his "Star of
Bethlehem," of which Frank Coffin sang
the tenor solo, so enthusiastic was its
reception.

Fire in a Dancing School.
During the semi-annual party given at
a dancing school at 1412 Polk street on
Saturday night the decorations of the
large hall where the dancing was in
progress caught fire. There were nearly
400 children in the room at the time but
through the presence of mind of several
of the gentlemen pr<-sf ; nt a panic was
overfed. The bunting that caught fire
was of a very light nature, and it burned
out in a moment, doing little or no dam
age As soon as the smoke was cleared
from the room the danclne waa resumed.
HOT ROW AT
UNION PARK
Bull's Decision Giving Bad
Shot the Race Causes
Trouble.
A String of Long Shots Upsets
the Talent Late in
the Day.
â â
G adiator XYeo Winner of the Stake at
the Ingleside Coursing
Park.
The usual peaceful Sunday at Union
Coursing Park gave way to the pushing
and menacing of a frenzied crowd, mad
dened over the decision of Judge Bull In
the laÃt race of the dayâ that between
Thornhill and Bad Shot. Thornhill was a
Bhort-ender, 1 to 5, against Bad Shot. |
Thornhill took the lead and kept It for
some distance, when the hare turnedâ
whether of Its own accord or being forced
by the hound is the question on which
the ruling was determined. After that
Bad Shot did work which was sufficient
In the Judge's eyes to give him the race.
And then the storm began.
The ehort-enders, with visions of $6
pleoes floating before them, saw only one
dog and It was Thornhill. When the flag
was ralÃed which bespoke Bad Shot the
winner, sweet oaths and imprecations j
filled the atmosphere and told Bull that
all was not well on the other side of the
fence. But Bull undauntedly tried to
make his way through the crowd to his
dressing-room. Violence in all its variety ,
of forms was threatened him. and some ;
genuine hand-to-hand engagements were j
fought by Bull's protectors and the short- |
enders. Bull finally wedged himsell out .
of the threatening mob of short-enders .
and dived behind the bar into the stor
age-room. The casualties were a pair of ,
discolored optics to one of the attacking
party, a pair of cut lips, a broken para- j
sol and several crushed hats.
The open stake races were run to the
finals and there left unfinished, for both
first and second prizes went to K. \.
Sullivan, the owner of False Flatterer
and Mira Monte. The pui#y stake was
WOO by Bad Shot.
The strong, vigorous nares more tnan
counteracted the heavy, slow held and i
some very pretty races were witnessed by
a crowd 'which the rain could not keep j
away. It was a day for the favorites un- ;
til the third ties were reached, and then j
a deluge of short-end winners swept over :
the form players, leaving them breathless ,
in open-eyed amazement. The short-end ,
ball began rolling when Mira Monte won
from Eclipse In a one-sided race at 1 to 5. j
Metallic repeated the performance, win
ning from Firenzi at 1 to 4. In the finals ;
False Flatterer measured the abilities of ;
Lord Byron and won with the odds at 2:
to 5 against him. Metallic lost to Mira
Monte in the second of the fourth ties
races being worn out by previously run
ning three no-goes. In a bye White \\ ings
at 1 to 5 won from Thornhill.

AT INGLESIDE.
The Dean stable kept up its record at
Ingleslde Coursing Park yesterday. Glad
iator won the stake. It was a hot con
test. Sylvanus was the runner up and
the first sprint resulted in an "undecided."
In the second trial it was Gladiator with
ease. The consolation event went to Tod
Sloan. Kingston was the runner up, and
the oourse was neck and neck. Kingston
was a bit wide of the game, and before
he could get in line Tod killed and won.
The cold and rainy weather of yester
day kept a large number of people away
from the Ingleside Coursing Park, but
nevertheless there were in attendance
nearly 4000 persons who were afforded an
excellent day's sport. The hares were re
marltably strong, and in almost every
course led the hounds a long chase. In
the main the talent had the best of it,
only a few short-enders landing. In the
reserve stake Bonita was the first to
down a favorite, beating out Van Nida,
who was generally picked as the stake
winner. Nellie B sent Hercules to his
kennel in the first course. In the con
solation stake, Monitor and L. S. Conley
failed to show up, their respective oppon
ents. Sir John Arnott and Sinaloa, run
ning byes. Sir John Arnott showed much
improvement, and bids fair to enter stake
ranks shortly. Twice he figured on the
short end, and both times landed.
At the opening of the day's sport both
the talent and the unknowing ones seemed
all at sea. There was hardly a candidate
in the stake that lacked supporters as a
final winner. The most popular were
Bonita, Promise Me, I,ittle Dell and Gladi
ator, the last named being played the
heaviest. The running in detail and by
courses was as follows:
Reserve stake â Ford & Duffy's Trlnk beat
H. Cairo's Fair Rosalind; F. Moxan's Van
Kirk beat O. Wallace's Fair View; B. DouÃh

The Fabiola Contention
Is Now but a
Memory.
Seeking Office Is Worse Than
Dodging Shells Off
Havana.
Kemarkable Change of Front in the
Attitude of SomÂ« Pol
iticians.
Oakland Office Ban Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, May 15.
It is said that Oakland, as a rule, does
not take anything very seriously, any
grpet length of time. Ir this were not
true, the Fabiola controversy might last
Indefinitely, for it opens up a field for
6t&CUBStOn compared to which the origin
of the contention is as nothing. That Dr.
Dille's remarks wore very pointed is true,
and there are many who believe as he
does. The ladies of Fabiola also enjoy
the confidence and esteem of the commu
nity and are also influential. To harmon
ize the two would be to bring about that
which evangelists have strived for nearly
2000 yearsâ the concession of society in its
somewhat restricted sense to the practice
of the doctrine which ultimately became
known as Puritahisno, but which at Ari
ttochj in the duys of Paul, was known as
"Christian."
There is no fear that the struggle be
tween those who condemn horse-racing
und its attributes and those who belit've
that In the exercise of charity the end
justifies the means, will be long-lived.
J Uv incident will pass away, and will be
referred to In history in the same spirit
as will be the water rate scandal, the
water-front riots, Dr. "Wendte's sensation
about euthanasia and similar things
which have stirred Oakland in the past.
Dr. Dille is rightâ "Abstain from all
appearance of evil."
Fabiula ladies are rightâ "And the
greatest of these is charity."
"Dodging bullets and shells off Morro ]
would be heaven compared to this." Such ,
Was the expression of a county office- |
holder this week. And if about a dozen |
oth.-rs had cried "amen" in chorus they!
OoulU all have told the truth.
This i.s truly a crucial period for the
professional politicians. A man can make
many mistakes In four years, and many
have been made. All kinds of enmities
have been aroused, but the victims have
only one hope of satisfaction. They can
wait till the primaries come around and |
then they can draw their bowie-knives i
and cut and slash to their hearts' con
tent. This is what many are now doing.
Discharged deputies, who imagine they
have a push or a puil in their respective j
precincts, ar<- now glorying in the amount
of discomfiture they hope they can cause, j
Everybody with a kick has to be placated j
by the man who would hold on to his
office, and placating in a dry summer is I
a very expensive pastime. It has ruined i
many men, and will ruin more before i
November. Still, it has to be done\ and j
â¢ r the argument be oral, physical
or <â : some other nature, it is alike a I
drain on the resources of the office-seeker |
and office-holder.
There can be no pleasant camping â 
vacation far from the dusty, hot streets [
men do politics; no deer-stalking:
lh Oregon; no flaunting defiance in the j
face of the enemy; for the struggle for
political existence is on. and he who
wavers is surely lost. And many who
Will not waver will be lost just as surely. ,
lii fact, politics In Alatneda County is a
tiHd lor grambling- than the Emery
\iii<_- track.
In spite of all the harrowing experi
ences of the office-hunters, there ia much
that is really funny. If the poor victims
of this craze would pause a moment in
their mad career and laugh at themselves,
they would feel better for the diversion.
Just thirteen months ago, no longer, there
were weeping and wailing in the Capitol
;. the men who knew how
office !n Alamdda County. A bill was in
troduced, the effect of which would be to
M â  .â > for the officials instead of al
k big appropriations as at present.
The funny part of the snatter was the
presumption shown l>y the incumbents
Â«nat they evidently considered their jobs
as theirs f>>r eternity. Under what other
â¢ â ration would they have flocked to
to to raise such a h<swl and to
declare that the proposed system of pay
ment would surely send the officials to the
j rh"iis.-. The arguments made were
heartrending and would have brought
tears to the eyes of anybody but a Cali
fornlan legislator.
Now behold the spectacle, and applaud
the discernment of the Californian legis
lator. All those office-holders who plead
ed at Sacrs.Tiento, without a single excep
tion, are risking their necks, their for
tunes, and in seme instances their repu
tations, in their efforts to secure certain
condemnation to the poorhouse at the
hands of the electors. And they go about,
shaking hands and smiling as warmly and
conscientiously as though the prospect of
a term of office uffered a decent living for
four years.
Senator F. S. Stratton has drawn a very
fine distinction between the last Senate
and the Assembly. The difference is, in
ferentially, that between men who pay
thHr bills and do not fear garnishment
and attachments and those who, from
some cause or other, live in dread of be
ing made to disgorge. Senator Stratum's
views are entertained In a letter to the
Merchants' Exchange, referring to a bill
f"r which the exchange worked hard last
year. He says:
"The 1)111 permitting salaries of public
officials to be attached ought to be
passed at the next session of the Legisla
ture, and I hope that you will not lose
sight of the matter on your part. We had
a very full debate In the Senate, and the j
measure went through there on Its mer- 1
its.
"I have no doubt of a favorable result
r.ext time, and by amending the bill so
that it will exempt the salaries of mem
bers of the Legislature and attaches I
think there ought to be but little oppo
sition. A great many in the Assembly I
opposed the measure on this ground, and j
tno complaint in that regard can be easily
removed without any detriment to the
law as a whole.
What is a Republican club and what is
a piece club, and can both exist as one \
organization? This question is being asked
frequently just now, and with good rea
son. In this county are Smith Repub
lican clubs and Brown ditto and the Rob
inson and Jones the same. What does
this mean? It suggests that the Repub
lican part of the club dies if the personal
part of it is beaten at the primaries. No
one can have any objection to a Pardee
club, or a Davis club, or a Barker club,
because they will die when their Idols
have no more need of hero worship; but
how about the persona! Republican clubs?
On what lines will they work after the
primaries? Will their Republicanism van
ish? STt'AKT W. BOOTH.
MOURNING FOE " SWIFT WATER."
Beports of His Death Cause Conster
nation Among His Backers.
OAKLAND. May 15.â The announce
ment of the death of Swiftwater .1.-.. '
Gates by drowning In Ivake Tagish in to
day's papers caused consternation in this
city, where he 1b well known and where
many of his backers in the present en
terprise reside. On his arrival here after
his marriage Mr. Gates purchased the
Klmball place, corner of Thirteenth and
Jackson streets, and announced his in
tention of installing his wife here. The
sensation caused by this had hardly vied
when he sold the place at a figure that
was declared to be twice what he put into
it. A company W&s then formed, and the
names of the Hinshaws. Laymances,
Bowles and others were connected with
that of Gates.
M. J. Laymance does not feel inclined
to accept the story as true. He believes
i..at Gates will be found to be alive.
Death of Mrs. Jane Wyeth.
OAKLAND, May 15.â Mrs. Jane Wyeth,
wire of Dr. J. H. Wyeth; of 825 Fourteenth
Ptreet, died late last night from conges
tion of the lungs. She had been In poor

Mrs. Wyeth was the mother of the late
William T. Wyeth, M. D.. Mrs. Sarah J.
Williams. Mrs. E. E. Dodge, Rev. Joseph

George Bayless Found Dead.
OAKLAND, May in.â George Bayless, a
horsetrainer about 45 years of age, was
found dead in his bed at the Randlett
House, on Park avenue, Emeryville, this
afternoon at 1 o'clock. He had been down
stairs at 12 o'clock and seemed all right.
Mrs. H. A. Randlett, the proprietor's wife,
visited the room an hour later and found
the man dead. The officials were noti
fied, and the remains were removed to
the Moreno, whore an inquest will be
hold Monday night. Baylcs? had been suf
fering from dropsy for some time, and
there is every reason to believe death re
sulted from that cause.
The Closing Days.
OAKLAND, May 35.â Rev. E. R. Ben
nett, pastor of the Twenty-third-avenue
Baptist Church, preached the baccalaur
eate sermon to the graduating class of

BACCALAUREATE ADDRESS.
Rev. H. C. Minton, D.D., on "The
Claims of Religion Upon Edu
cated Thought."
BERKELEY. May 15.â Rev. H. C. Mln
ton, D.D., delivered the baccalaureate
address to the graduating class of the !
University of Calffornia this afternoon in j
the First Presbyterian Church of Berke- j
ley. Dr. Minton spoke on "The Claims j
of Religion Tpon Educated Thought."
l!n said. In part:
Educated men and women are to know
something, they are to believe something:, they
are to do something. They must possess
knowledge, wisdom, virtue. That is to say,
their attainments, must be intellectual, ra
tional and moral. Religion lias to do vitally
with what we- know. The facts â¢ and forces
and phenomena of religion are too Ã¼biquitous
to be ignored. Religion has, furthermore, a
claim upon educated intellect because it is
without question a tremendous social factor
in the world to-day. And. lastly, religion is
entitled to your intellectual regard not only
because it Is such a persistent historical phe
nomenon, not only because it is such a per
vasive social influence, but also because it is
such a tremendously Influential moral force
among men.
The members of the graduating class
attended the address in a body, for the
first time in the history of the university,
the custom, although a common one in
the East, never before having been ob
served at Berkeley. Music was furnished
by the University Glee Club.

to the heroes of the Maine in these
words: "We are not unmindful of the
heroes of our nation to whom death hath
come as a thief in the night. Help us bear
with patience the great sacrifice and give
us the light that we may see that thou
does all things well." The closing words

CONFIRMATION
AT ST. BRIGID'S
Over One Hundred Children
Kneel to Receive the
Sacrament.
The Solemnization of Benediction
Follows an Eloquent Address by
Archbishop Riordan.
Over a hundred children received the
sacrament of confirmation yesterday aft
ernoon at St. Brigid's Church after
months of thorough preparation and
study. Archbishop Riordan, who per
formed the ceremony, delivered an elo
quent address on the subject of confirma
tion and the necessity of the sacrament
as a means of salvation. He indicated
and emphasized the importance of a
strict adhesion to the commandments of
God and the precepts of the church while
in the time of youth, as it forms In after
life a basis of purity, integrity and
righteousness and molds the general char
acter into a firm disposition of love to
ward God and man.
At the conclusion of the sermon a
solemn benediction was celebrated by the
Archbishop in person, assisted by the
Rev. Father Cottle and the clergy of the
parish.
To commemorate the second anniver
sary of the death of Governor Burnett,
the first chief executive of California, a
requiem high mass will be celebrated in
the church to-morrow morning at 9
o'clock. The members of the Pioneer So
ciety will attend in a body and will pay
their respects to their dead comrade with
a tribute of prayer and devotion.
Ascension day will be observed general
ly throughout the Catholic church next
Thursday and masses will be said the
same as on Sundays.
"Consecrated Muscle."
The Young Men's Christian Association
held its regular Sunday afternoon meet
ing in its building yesterday afternoon,
and there was an unusually large attend
ance. Interest was added to the affair
by the presence of the Portland basket
ball team, who assisted M. M. Ringler in
leading the services. There were six meni
bers of the team, including Captain
Riggers.:'- r_; .;.:.-â  ".-.'-:â 
Mr. Ringler, who is the physical direc
tor of the Portland Y. M. C. A., delivered
the address and took for his subject
"Consecrated Muscle." : He. said that he
was a stanch adherent of physical de
velopment in young men, for when the
body 'was healthy he was better able to
consecrate it to Christian service. Phys
ical exercise made better men. and better
Christian .work was the result. He ad
vised his hearers to pay attention to
their spititual as well a3 their physical
welfare. '_.- _ 'â _ 'â  . ..'â  â

Isobars, or solid llneÃ, connect points cf equal

barometric pressure and Is usually accompanied
by fair weather; "low" refers to â  low pres

by cloudy weather and rains. "lews" usually
first appear on the Washington coast. I When
the pressure is high in the Interior and low
along the coast, and the isobars extend north

but when the "low" Is Inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is im
probable. With a "high" In the vicinity of

In summer and colder weather In winter. ' The

ARMING OF THE
CUT OF PEKING
Part of the Mohican's
Battery Was Put on
Her Yesterday.
Rapid Promotion of Captain
Thompson of the Ship
Roanoke.
Troubles and Dissensions Among the
Crew of the Klondike Steamer
Cleveland.
The work of gretting the Manila trans
ports ready Is processing rapidly. Car
penters are working night and day on the
steamers Australia and City of Peking,
and both of them will proba^.y be ready
for sea to-morrow night. Yesterday the
Unadllla came down from the navy yard
and took away the Mohican's battery, j
Four of the guns are for the Charleston's j
fighting top and the others were taken to j
the Peking and will be mounted on her j
forward deck. Work on the Ohio and City
of Sydney is not being rushed as much j
as on the other two vessels, and it will j
probably be the latter part of the week |
before they get away. The Government â 
finally decided not to take the Conemaugh j
and yesterday she left for Seattle to bring
down a load of coal.
The rise of Captain Thompson of the
American ship Roanoke has been very
rapid. He is only 25 years of age, and
yet he commands one of the finest Amer
ican merchantman afloat. He is well
known on this coast, having served as
mate on the bark Andrew Welch and |
barkentine Archer in the Hawaiian trade, t
From here Captain Thompson went to |
New York and was appointed second offi
cer of the Roanoke. When the ship
reached Yokohama the first mate left her
and Thompson was promoted. From lp
kohama the Roanoke went to Honolulu
and loader sugar for New York. "\\ hen
thirty days out on the homeward voyage
Captain Hamilton died and Thompson
was left the only navigator aboard. He
made the boatswain take the first mate' a
watch and promoted one of the sailors
to the position of second mate. This was
working under difficulties, but in spite of
it all Captain Thompson took his ship to
New York in the smart time of 109 days.
In view of the splendid showing he had
made the owners of the vessel confirmed
him in the command, and his many
friends in San Francisco are still con
gratulating him upon his success.
The brig Galilee arrived from Tahiti
yesterday with three passengersâ Mrs.
Lambert, John White and J. P. Riecizâ
and a full cargo of copra and cocoanuts. j
Captain Dinsmore reports that everything j
was very quiet in Tahiti and the Mar- i
quesas, and that little or nothing is i
known down there about the trouble with \
Spain. The Galilee came up in twenty- '
nine days, and the passengers say it was j
a most delightful voyage throughout.
The barkentine Jane A. Falkinburg was |
to have sailed for Kotzebue Sound yester- !
day but owing to a falling barometer and
otber indications of a storm Captain Cook
decided to remain in port until this morn
ing. The FalkJnburg has on board the
following passengers: C. D. Lane of the |
Utica mine and his son. Louis Lane;
Hank Smith, the old superintendent of |
the Belcher mine; A. Blakeley, a mining

The stern-wheel steamer Rideout will
be ready to leave for the Yukon in about j
ten days. She is now having her ma- ;
chinery" put in and her deckhouses erect- I
cd. and as soon as these jobs are com- j
pleted a start will be made. She will be j
towed to Dutch Harbor by the Tillamook, |
and will then under her own steam tow |
four barges to St. Michael. At St. Michael â 
Bhe will meet the passenger steamer Mor
gan City from this port and will take her !
passengers to Dawson City.
Another schooner with gold-hunters |
aboard arrived from Boston yesterday, i
It was the Julia E. Whalen, and she took I
150 days to make the run. Her pas
sengers will fit out here and then the voy- i
age will be continued to St. Michael.
The steamer Cleveland is once more in
trouble ajid the chances are that an en- !
tire new crew will take her out. Captain ;
Hall left her as soon as she docked after \
her arrival from Seattle yesterday, and :
almost everybody in the engineer's de- |
partment will quit her to-day. The mate j
and the purser are at loggerheads, and
yesterday the purser had to hire a long- -,
shoreman to do some odds and ends j
about the ship as the mate would not
let one of the hands do them for him.
Very little has been heard of the old i
steamer since so many of her crew were j
drowned and she nearly became a total
wreck, but it now appears that she is I
once more to come before the public, and !
this time probably in the courts.

"Our Spanish Conquestsâ What Shall
We Do KVith Them?" was the subject of
a prelude to the regular sermon at the
Howard street Methodist Episcopal
Church last night, delivered by Rev. John
A. B. "Wilson. In reference to the subject
the pastor said:
No ; man lives more them twenty-five years
beyond his age. Even great Washington
could not see a century in advance of his own
period. The counsel left us in his farewell
address for a quarter and even for three
quarters of a century it may have been wis

MIGHT HAVE BEEN
STRAWBERRIES
Peculiar Death of a Little
Girl After Eating the
Fruit.
It Is Believed That Paris Green
Was Used as an Insect
icide.
There have been a number of serious
Illnesses in the city which were at
tributed to eating strawberries, but the
first death supposed to have been caused
by eating the fruit is that of Nina Has
sett, the little six-year-old daughter of
Mrs. Emma Hassett, living at 204 Hyde
street. While there is no positive proof
that the little girl died from poison, and
while her family will not say that her
death was the direct result of eating
strawberries grown on vines sprinkled
with paris green, the fact that they
admit that this "might have been" the
cause lends color to the belief that it
was.
The little girl was taken sick Thurs
day morning with cramps in her stomach
and vomiting. Dr. Wilcox was called to
attend the child, but in spite of his efforts
she died Friday morning, having been
unconscious and in spasms all of the pre
ceding night. The doctor signed a death
certificate giving the cause of death as
cholera morbtis, and the body was buried
at the Odd Fellows' Cemetery yesterday
afternoon. Dr. Wilcox said that the
symptoms were those of cholera in
fantum, and inquired what the child had
been eating. When told that she had
eaten strawberries recently he ventured
the assertion that they may have been
the cause of her illness and death.
Mrs. Hassett said last evening- that a
young lady named Miss McClellan, who
attended Sunday-school with the child,
died this week with similar symptoms,
and this death was also one of the
"might have been strawberries" cases.
The Mother Relation.
Rev, R. H. Moreland of St. Luke's
Church delivered an interesting j^cture
last evening on the subject of 'mother
hood. "The relation of mother to child
is the most sacred of all," he said, "and
is under the immediate protection of God.
There is a sanctity about this relation
which knows no equal in the perfection of
love, devotion and pure religious pplrlt.
When God takes the mother away from
the infant some concealed motive under
lies the act, it is to perfect the blessed
ness of both."
Another Street for Dewey.
Editor Callâ Dear Sir: As some of our cit
izens are desirous of showing their apprecia-
tton of the splendid achievement of Admiral
Dewey at Manila by naming one of our streets
for him, why tint Mission street; It is one of
our principal streets.
Admiral Dewey'* career and Mission street
began at about the same time. Mission street
begins but has practically no ending-. ,<ow
then let us hope that our Dewey, hts fame
and the gratitude of our people, like Mission
street, will know no ending.

THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MJIY 16, 1898.
NATIONAL
GUARDSMEN
Regiment Existing Only
in Name and With
out Officers.
City Armories Present a Very
Desolate and Deserted
Appearance.
It Is Probable There Will Not Be a
Skirmish Shoot This Month.
The Reoryanization.
Those members of the National Guard
of California who were not included in
the call for California's quota of volun
teers, and those who were rejected upon
examination at muster, are wondering
what will be done in the matter of re
organizing the guard.
The First Regiment of Infantry is still
in existence, that is officially, but It is
without officers. There still remains a
portion of each company, for although
they were not accepted by the United
States army officers they are still mem
bers of the" guard, because the fact that
they were rejected did not act as a dis
charge from the guard. In fact no mem
ber of the First Regiment has been dis
charged from the service of the btate,
and a peculiar state of affairs exists at
this time. Colonel James F. Smith and
all the officers are still on the roster of
the National Guard of the State, and at
the same time he holds a commission as
colonel of th* First California Volunteers
and other officers of the command also
hold commissions in that organization.
The law governing the guard in this State
declares that no officer can be a member
of two military organizations at the same
time, and the condition of affairs at
present has been the talk of the guards
men during the past week. They say that
all the men who have enlisted in the vol
unteers will have to be discharged from
the service of the State, on account of
removal, when they shall have left for
the Philippines, but then there will not be
any colonel of the regiment to discharge
them, and the problem is who will dis
charge them?
PICKING UP STRINGS.
The superior officers of the guard are
at this time "picking up strings," as one
of them said when asked what is to be
done in the matter of rehabilitating the
guard. During the week the adjutant
general was busy making arrangements
with the United States officers about the
property turned over to the Government
by the "companies that were accepted in
the volunteer service, and he was also
arranging as to the responsibilities of the
captains of the several companies that
are under bonds for the safekeeping of
State property. As soon as all the strings
shall have been picked up it is probable
that stens will be taken to recruit the
regiments from which the volunteers
have been taken and place the guard on
a footing that will make it effective
should there be a demand for the ser
vices of the men in case of an invasion
by the Spanish, "for there is no telling,"
said one of the guardsmen, "but that
the Spaniards might send ships to this
cuast to harass the people."
THE NAVAL MILITIA.
A more disgusted set of men than those
who make up the Naval MiMtia at this
port it would be difficult to find, except
it be those who belong to the Signal
Corps and to Troop A. "Here," said one
of the men of the Marion, "we have been
drilling and preparing for active service
ever since there was talk of war, and
now that we are ready and willing to go
anywhere that our services may be need
ed we are informed that we will not be
required. It is discouraging, to say the
least."
REGIMENTAL ARMORY.
The regimental armory of the First In
. fantry at Pago and Gough streets is very
', much deserted at this time. On the black
1 board Is the last regimental order issued,
No. 3, March 11, ordering the axinual mi
i spection and muster. Alongside of thia
: is the announcement that Captain Car
rington's headquarters have been trans
ferred to the California Hotel, and under
! neath is written, "This armory will be
closed on Sunday at 12 o'clock. By order
of Major Jansen."
The large assembly room in which were
I quartered for a time about 2000 men,
while waiting to be moved to the city of
: tents at the Presidio, has a most desolate
appearance. The gun racks are empty,
j and it lacks the life and bustle that was
in the past observable when the men as
: sembled there and were put through
! fours right and fours left. The several
! company rooms also have a deserted
j look. The regimental colors are missing
| and about the only things left are the
pictures on the walls, the tables and
| desks and the full-dres uniforms and
I helmets in the lockers.
Those few who are part of each of the
i eight companies of the First that were
i quartered there stroll into the armory
I by day and by night and have a chat
with genial John Sheldon, the armorer.
who remains at his post as in days or
yore.
What will be done in the matter of re
cruiting the regiment and filling the va
cancies that exist is something that not
I one at this time is ready to answer. In
i the meantime the armory is in charge of
I Major Jansen, brigade inspector of the
] Second Brigade.
THE OTHER ARMORIES.
The Ellls-stret armorj'', in which were
located Companies C, G, F and X and the
Signal Corps of the Second Brigade, is
now tenanted only by the signalmen and
the few members of the four companies
not accepted In the volunteer service.
The members of the Signal Corps meet
there regularly and have their drills, the
members hoping that the War Depart
ment will yet order them to accompany
the expedition to the Philippines. Many
of the men are of the opinion that it Is
only a hope.
The armorj' of Troop A, Cavalry, at the
old regimental armory on Market street,
near Tenth, is occupied by the members
of the troop, who like the signalmen feel
disappointed that they have not been
called out. Still they are keeping: up good
spirits, and they too expect that there
will be a call for additional men and
that they will have a chance to go to the
front.
THE STATE SHOOT.
The indications are that the State shoot
set for this month will be passed on ac
count of the unsettled condition of af
fairs In the guard. As yet no orders for
the shoot have been Issued, and com
manding officers have no idea when any
will be issued. This is the month for
skirmish firing, but it looks as If the
targets will not be punctured.

rope ! and I, the . ; available â ? crowd at 0 the

It .was : advertised that the big elephant

FILL OF RAIN
WAS GENERAL
San Joaquin Valley Fields
Receive a Tardy
Drenching.
Downpour Too Late to Save
Crops and Damage Is
Reported.
In Other Sections of the State the
Frecipitmion Proves of Great
Benefit.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, May 15.â Rain fell here
last night, beginning shortly after mid
night and continuing until dawn. The
precipitation, according to the official
report of the weather bureau, amount
ed to .52 of an inch. During the day in
termittent showers occurred and mdi- j
cations are for more rain to-night. The
downpour at this time was most unex
pected, and the general belief is that it
will do much damage. Farmers had
cut their wheat crops for hay. This
has been ruined and alfalfa is also |
damaged. The effect on the raisin crop j
is not definitely known, but it is be
lieved that the vines have suffered con
siderably. The first crop of raisins will
be less than was expected, on account
of the rain. Should frost follow the j
damage will be great.
STOCKTON, May 15.â Eighty-eight
hundredths of an inch of rain fell in
this part of the San Joaquin Vally be
tween sundown last evening and 9
o'clock this morning. It would have ;
been a million-dollar rain had it come j
six weeks ago. The downpour was slow â¢
and steady. It is believed that as it is j
now the rain will work positive injury j
especially where hay has been cut and
lies in the fields. This was the heavi- i
est May storm on record for this sec
tion.
TULARE, May 15.â Fifty-two-hun
dredths of an inch of rain fell here last
night. It comes too late to save grain, j
but will do great srood to alfalfa fields, j
will start the wild feed and assist \
young trees and vines. Ditch water I
was very scarce and orchards and vine- j
yards were suff ring. Summer crops
of corn and sorghum will be greatly
benefited. Tulare will have hay to ex
port, a full crop of grapes, a small crop
of prunes and more than enough peach
es for home consumption. The indica
tions are that there will be more rain j
to-night.
SANTA BARBARA, May 15.â The [
heaviest rain storm of the season visit
ed this place yesterday. Rain began
falling in the afternoon, continuing all
night until daylight to-day. It was a
steady, heavy downpour. 'i.lÂ» precipi
tation amounted to 1.25 inches. The
rain will help the corn and bean crops
materially.
LOS OLIVOS, May 15.â The heaviest j
rain of the season has been falling since
yesterday afternoon at 5:30 o'clock. It
comes to\r late to be of any benefit ex
cept to some fruits and a small acreage !
of summer crops.
LOS ANGELES, May 15.â Rain com- ;
menced falling about midnight last j
night and continued until 10 o'clock to- |
day, 1.46 of a.n inch falling altogether. |
The rain is valuable in that it will fill t
the storage reservoirs, but it has dam
aged considerable hay, which the farm
ers were very late in cutting this year, j
The rain comes too late to help the fruit
crop. So heavy a rain at this time of
year is exceptional here. It was gen- j
eral over Southern California.
VENTURA, May 15.â Last night Yen- I
tura County was visited by a heavy
rainfallâ at Ventura, 1.50 inches; Ojai
Valley, 2; Wheelers Canyon, 2.25; Santa
Paula, 1.50; Oxnard. 1.25; Somis, 0.85.
Great good to hay, beets and fruit will
result. The weather Is still unsettled
and rain indications are excellent.
SAN DIEGO, May 15.â Rain began
falling here about 1 o'clock this after
rocn, and up to 5 o'clock the precipita
tion was .18 of an inch. In the country, ]
however, the storm was much heavier.
The rain comes to late to be of benefit ;
to grain, hut in some localities it will
help the late sown.
THE RAIN BRINGS
TONS OF GRAIN
It Will Add a Third to the
Crops of Califor
nia.
Shippers Already Preparing to Reach
for the Trade of the
Philippines.
Saturday's and Sunday's rain was worth
hundreds of thousands of dollars to the
farmers of California. Many fields of
wheat were saved from total destruction.
Barley, however, benefited more than
any of the other grains. The barley crop
will In many sections be a fair one, and
that dependent upon irrigation was saved
just in time. The rain will afford a
water supply sufficient to make a fair
result.
Before the rain the wheat crop of Cal
ifornia was placed at 250,000 tons and the
barley crop at 100,000 tons. Well informed
grain dealers estimate the late precipita
tion will add 100.000 tons of wheat and
160,000 tons of barley to the crops. Hay
undoubtedly suffered considerably.
The grain trade was surprised last week
when It became known that 30,000 tons of
wheat will be shipped immediately to
Liverpool via rail to New Orleans, thence
by water. The time in transit will be
decreased from 90 to 100 days. The very
high price for spot wheat in Liverpool
admits of the rail rate to New Orleans,
allowing a handsome profit to shippers.
Allowing for rail and ocean rates, Cali
fornia wheat can be sold at Jl 95 per
cental.
The price for May wheat on Saturday
was $1 80; this allows a margin profit of
15 cents. The effect of shipping via New
Orleans will rapidly absorb present stocks
and will assure to fanners good prices for
their growing crops.
Already shippers are reaching out for
the Philippine trade, which gives evi
dence of being a matter of great Import
ance to the flour Industry of the Pacific
Coast. Every Inch of rain for the next
ten days will add many thousand tons to
the wheat and barley crops. Reports
from all points over the State are of the
most hopeful nature, and farmers are
Jubilant.
Unclaimed Articles.
There were left unclaimed In the Cuban
booth at the Masonic Festival an oak

Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, May 15.â 1t seemed for %
time to-day that the game between
Stockton and Fresno would not take
place, as heavy rain fell during the
night and continued at intervals dur
ing the afternoon. Fresno won by a
I one-sided score, although the Stocktons
played a uphill game. Thomas
for Fresno pitched a steady game,
holding the visitors down to
four hits, one a scratch. Earle,
Moore and Held carried off the infield
i honors. McCue and Ferguson put up

i ing two of the prettiest putouts in cen
ter ever seen here.

MONSTROUS
PLOT OF
DESTRUCTION
Rumor of a Design to
Blow Up the Ma
sonic Fair.
Spaniards Around Wil
liams Give the Tuscan
Lodge a Scare.
The Pavilion Was Patrolled
and the Grounds
Searched.
NO EVIDENCE DISCOVERED
ChlÂ«f Lees Ordered m Strict In
vestigation, but Found
Nothing.
On Thursday last a rumor reached the
assembled Masons of Tuscan Lodge of
Williams, a small town near Sacramen
to, telling of a plan prompted by Spanish
treachery and villainy, compared wth
which the famous and historic gunpowder
plot sinks into insignificance.
The enormity of the crime and the das
tardly intentions of the perpetrators of
the rumored plot swept over the lodge
meeting, and so impressed were the hor-
ror-stricken Masons present that a mem- !
her was delegated to set out for San j
Francisco at once and place the facts be- j
tore Chief Lees.
For some time the Spanish population â 
about Williams has shown signs of fer- j
mentation, anil just what outward ex
pression the malice and hate of the sons j
of effete and impotent Spain would as- |
sume was a matter of conjecture to the
residents of Williams.
Thursday several of the members of !
Tuscan Lodge believed the:" had discov
ered a plot which if consummated would
mean at least the destruction of thous- j
anJs of lives and the great Mechanics' |
Pavilion of this city. The blow was to
be struck when the largest possible num
ber of human beings could be cut off at a !
single stroke. Gathered for the purpose !
of charity, with the animation and spirit ,
of a people celebrating a holiday, the mul
titude collected in the Pavilion on Friday j
night was to be destroyed by gunpowder, i
On Friday the delegate arrived from
Williams, and without losing a second of
time he saw Chief Lees and unfolded to !
him the details of what he had learned j
from his brother Masons. Strong belief j
had been placed in the rumor that shook
with horror the lodge meeting at Wil- i
liams.
Lees did not place much credence in the
story, but h& acted upon the information
at once.
The Pavilion was searched from post
tn post, every nook and cranny was ex
plored, but no evidences of any kind,
which would lead to the belief that such
a gigantic scheme of destruction to life
ana limb had been prepared, were discov
ered.
Forty - eight policemen in citizens'
clothes were assigned for police duty at
the Pavilion Friday night. The same i
number of men patrolled the hall Satur
day afternoon and evening for fear that !
some attempt might be made by an indi
viuuaJ fanatic to destroy the building, ;
with its preat crowds of visitors. Noth
ing, however, was brought to light which
in any way presented evidence of the j
monstrous plot which the people of Wil
liams feared would o%'ertake the attend- '
ams of the Masonic fair last Friday
evening.
The matter will be further investigated.
THEIR ROWS NOT SETTLED.
Democratic State Committee Will
Probably Ignore Both Fighting
Wings of the Party.
There was a lively session of the sub- j
committee of the Democratic State Cen- i
tral Committeee at the California Hotel !
last night, at which the differences be- :
tween the two contending wings of the
Democratic party were fully discussed j
until after 10 o'clock.
It was understood at the outset of the
meeting that all delegates were pledged
td absolute secrecy, that newspaper men i
â¢were excluded, and everything done, even j
to the fact that there would be another
Besston, should be kept from the public, j
In spite of these restrictions the following !
transpired:
After a great deal of discussion the
committee adjourned to meet at the Cal-
Ifomla Hotel again at 1 o'clock to-day. !
It was practically decided that neither of j
the contending committees claiming au- i
thority to represent the party will be rec
ognized and that some sort of a compro- |
mise measure, the nature of which in de- j
tail has not yet been formulated . will De j
agreed upon at an early date.
A sentinel was stationed at the door !
during the session, but. a rumor gained :
currency that despite this precaution a \
yellow reporter had secured a room next <
to the committee. This caused some ex
citement for a time, but it was afterward i
discovered that the only basis of the stoiy I
was the fact that a newspaper man ate '
his dinner at the hotel about the thna the !
committee began its deliberations.
Thinks He Was Murdered.
F. W. Burroughs, a sailor on the United
States steamer Mohican, claims that C.
A. Schafer. who died in the City Prison
last Saturday morning from opium pois
oning, did not commit suicide, but was
murdered. Last night he visited police
headquarters and asked the police to
make an investigation. He claims that a
man named Wilson had threatened to
kill Schafer on account of the latter's fa
miliarity with h!.s wife. Burroughs is
convinced that Wilson got Schafer drunk
and then gave him the poison which
caused his death. His story is discred
ited by the police.
Preparing for the Dog Show.
The Mechanics' Pavilion is being put in
readiness for the bench show, which
opens on Wednesday evening. Superin
tendent Oldham and Directors Barker,
De Ruyter and Wiliiams are superintend
ing the arrangements, and they promise
to have matters in good shape for the
best display of the dogs on opening night.
The proceeds of the show will be given
to the children's Hospital. The show will
continue until Saturday night.
Robbed in a Dance Hall.
John Ruttlidge was arrested in the Eu
reka Dance Hall last evening on the com
plaint of William Kline for stealing the
Tatter's gold watch and chain. Ruttlidge
was taken to the California-street Police
Station and searched. The watch, with
a number of other articles belonging to
Kline, were found on him. lie was
charged with grand larceny.

EDOUARD REMENYI DIES SUDDENLY
The Curtain Rang Down on the Life of the
Great Musician on the Orpheum Stage.
Edouard Remenyi, the famous violinist, has made his last appearance on
earth. The curtain was rung down upon his life at the Orpheum Theater
yesterday afternoon. His death was very sudden, and wholly unexpected.
It occurred just as he had often wished it wouldâ with his violin in his
hand.
Yesterday afternoon was the great musician's first engagement at a vau
deville theater on the Pacific Coast. He had been seen here many times be
fore, and always with a concert
company of high class artists.
Just before Remenyi appeared be
fore the footlights, he was sitting
at a table behind the scenes, with
his violin. He seemed to be in good
health and spirits, and conversed in
a jovial manner. "Morrissey," said
It was thought the violinist had fainted, and he was hurriedly carried to
the rear of the stage, and thence to the Orpheum Annex, where three doc
tors were soon in attendance.
But the life of Remenyi had fled. It was a fitting finale. His exit
was in accord with his career. It began on the stage and ended on the
stage.
The sad intelligence of his death was telegraphed to Mrs. Remenyi and
his son and daughter in New York by Colonel Kowalski, his friend, who
took charge of his effects, including two violinsâ one an Amati valued at
$6000, and the other worth $1000.
Remenyi's art gallery in New York
was valued by him at $100,000, while
art connoisseurs estimated it to be
worth not less than $65,000.
The death of Remenyi was not
announced to the audience, and the
performance proceeded without any
one in the auditorium knowing that
the violinist had played his last
time in this world. It was truly
a farewell appearance.
Edouard Remenyi was born six
ty-four years ago in Budapest,
Hungary. His master on the violin
was Joseph Bohm, who also taught
the great Joseph Joachim. During
the Hungarian uprising Remenyi,
then quite a boy, enlisted as a sol
dier and fought brilliantly; he be
came â¢ aid-de-camp to Gyorgey,
when the latter was appointed
commander-in-chief of the hero
army of Hungary, and though at
that time a little lieutenant of
sixteen summers, Remenyi used tS
delight the old veterans with his
music and make their hearts glad
and brave for the next day's fray.
After the defeat of the insurgents
he had to leave his country and re
solved to go to England. On the
way he made the acquaintance of
his celebrated countryman, Franz
Liszt, who, recognizing his genius,
became his friend and adviser.
Soon after the young artist's arrival in London he was appointed solo
violinist to the Queen. When he obtained his amnesty he returned to
Hungary, where he afterwards received from the Emperor of Austria a sim
ilar distinction to that granted him in England. In the meantime he had
made himself famous by numerous concerts in the European capitals. He
then retired for a time from public life, but in 1575 he resumed his artistic
career in Paris, where he was received with great enthusiasm. His first
tour of America was begun November 11, 1878, and his successes during that
and the following seasons are still fresh in the minds of the public.
He made triumphal tours of the entire globe, combining music with cir
cumnavigation, and charming with dulcet strains natives of the Sandwich
Islands, Australia, Tasmania, Dutch Indies, Java, India, Madras, Ceylon,
China, Japan, Philippine Islands and South Africa, where he remained for
a period of three years.
It is seldom that a man is accorded the privilege of learning the exact
amount of esteem in which he is held by his fellow men by perusing his
own obituary. This curious and unusual experience was an incident in the
life of Remenyl, who was reported drowned during his passage from India
to South Africa, The sadness which this melancholy information aroused
throughout the civilized world was happily dispelled when six months later
dispatches announced his safe arrival at the Cape of Good Hope.
Remenyi turned his wanderings of the last twelve years to literary ac
count and wrote a book on Japanese art, which will soon be published in
London.
EVANGELISTS WILL
GO WITH THE ARMY.
General Howard and Major Whipple
to Hold Meetings in Cuban
Camps.
TAMPA, Fla., May 15.â When the
United States troops at Tampa embark
for Cuba they may be followed soon
after by some of the famous evangelists
in the United States. General O. O.
Howard, U. S. A., retired, now an evan
gelist, arrived at Tampa to-day, ac
companied by Major D. W. Whipple.
A movement was recently begun by
D. L. Moody, having for its object the
sending of noted speakers to the vari-
ous rendezvouses of the soldiers to hold
meetings for their spiritual instruction.
General Howard and Major Whipple
have visited Chickamauga, Atlanta and
Mobile. As most of the regiments here
are without chaplains, the sending to
Cuba of several noted divines to work
among the soldiers is contemplated. It
is hardly probable that they will ac
company the soldiers when the expedi
tion moves out, but once the army is
settled in Cuba and the campaign
against the Spanish forces is fairly on,
evangelical work will be actively be
gun. General Howard and Major
Whipple spoke at the Tampa Heights
camp grounds to-night.
NEGOTIATING FOR AN
EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS.
Under a Flag of Truce the Release of
Two American Journalists
Is Sought.
HAVANA. May 15.â The Spaniards
recently captured two Americans, both
of whom claim to be newspaper cor
respondents and one of whom says he
is an electrical engineer. They were
taken at Salado. One carried a camera,
wore a small five-pointed star and had
a quantity of mail matter on his per
son. When captured, they threw them
selves on Spanish generosity and
shouted: "Viva Espana." It is re
ported that a third member of the party
made his escape by swimming.
The two who were captured arrived
here to-day and were taken to Cabal
leria wharf and from there were car
ried to Cabanas fortress. At 2 o'clock
this afternoon a newspaper dispatch
boat was seen approaching the entrance
of the harbor bearing a flag of truce.
Mr. Marengo, the chief of staff on the
naval station, went to meet the boat in
a launch. The American vessel lowered
a small boat with two American officers
who informed Mr. Marengo that their
object was to effect an exchange of
Spanish prisoners for the American
correspondents captured at Salado. Mr.

he to the Orpheum manager,
"there's my good friend." and there
upon he placed his hand affection
ately upon his violin.
As he walked to the front of the
stage, he viewed the audience with
apparently great satisfaction, and
then played a fantasie â his own ar
rangementâfrom "The Huguenots."
The hand o* the aged master had
lost none of its cunning and the
magic and charm of his music
seemed as great as In the years of
his earlier career. In response to
a most enthusiastic encore, Remen
yi executed, in exquisite style, "The
Liberty Hymn â Invincible Old
Glory," which he composed in 1879.
It was received with tremendous
applause, and upon its subsidence
he came again to the front with a
pleased smile, and started to play
"Pizzlcato" from Sylvia. He fin
ished throe bars, and then fell for
ward to the footlights, hugging his
precious violin as if to protect it
from injury.
Marengo then returned to lay the mat
ter before Governor General Blanco,
after which the launch went out again,
this time carrying also Colonel Gelpi of
the general staff and Mr. Gollan, the
British Consul General. A conference
was then held on board the Spanish
launch.
COLONEL WAGNER
GOES TO TAMPA
And Now It Is Thought the Invasion
of Cuba Will Soon Be Com
menced.
TAMPA, Fla., May 15.â Colonel A.
Wagner, representing: the army on the
Advisory Board of the War Depart
ment and a member of Colonel Miles'
staff, arrived in Tampa to-day and re
ported at once to General Wade. He
refused to talk on the object of his
visit here.
The presence of a member of the ad
visory board in Tampa at this time,
however, brought about a feeling that
the time for the invasion by the United
States forces is now very near. Added
significance was given Colonel Wag
ner's sudden visit to Tampa by the ar
rival on the steamer Mascotte of Lieu
tenant A. S. Rowan, who accompanied
Captain Dorst on the Leyden expedi
tion from Key West to Cuba,
Lieutenant Rowan brought with him
dispatches from the insurgent leader,
General Garcia, involving, it is be
lieved, a complete plan for the co-oper
ation of that part of the Cuban army
with the forces of the United States.
Lieutenant Rowan was brought to
Tampa from Port Tampa on a special
train and was immediately shown to
Colonel Wagner's aoartments in the
Tampa Bay Hotel.
AMERICANS CENSURED
FROM HAVANA PULPITS.
Accused oi Bombarding Cities Solely
to lÂ»estroy Property and
Kill People.
HAVANA, May 15.â 1n all the pulpits
to-day the American practice of bom
barding defenseless towns "without
previous notification" was severely
censured. Those who administered the
rebuke said towns should not be bom
barded solely to destroy property nor
to kill people, nor for mere pleasure,
and pointed out that in the interests of
humanity, international law had pro
vided that towns must not be bombard
ed until the forces of the attacking
party were in condition to assault and
take the towns.
In political' circles it is said that the
Americans,* while pretending that they
do not wish the reconcentrados to die
of starvation, are nevertheless ready to
kill over a million people by their
blockade.
COMFORT FOR THE
NATIONS DEFENDERS
ALTHOUGH yesterday was the Sab
bath the tireless workers of the
Red Cross Society were not Idle,
but plied their needles all day in an
effort to fulfill the Government's sudden
call on the society for CSOO abdominal
belts, which are to be worn by the men
in southern climes. Many who were
anxious to labor in the noble cause were
unable to do so, owing to the fact that
all stores were closed. To-day it Is ex
pected there will be large purchases of
the material to be used in making the
belts.
Mrs. Harrington, who is at the head of
the great undertaking, visited Major
White at the Presidio yesterday for the
purpose of conferring with him in re
gard to the line of work to be best pur
sued by the Red Cross. He stated to her
that he was delighted to have the so
ciety's help, and suggested that they
continue collecting funds, using tnem ior
the purchasing of comforts for the men.
He stated that the Government would
furnish lints, medicines and bandages,
but might not be able to give the men
articles that might be termed luxuries.
Major White assured Mrs. Harrington
that her society was doing yeoman serv
ice, and expressed a hope that they
would continue their humane work.
Ten young soldiers occupied the brig
ade hospital yesterday, attended by two
trained nurses wearing the badge or the
Red Cross. The men were suffering from
colds brought on by exposure, but were
rapidly recovering, thanks to the watch
ful care of Dr. Farrel and his assistants.
The physicians all speak in glowing
terms of the work of the society Dr.
Farrel stated that but for its assistance
he would not be able to send the men
back to their quarters as cured in sucn
quick time. He called attention to the
rubber blankets that the Red Cross had
sent out to be placed on the ground in the
hospital tent, thus preventing the damp
ness being felt. At Fontana s ware
house, where the men of the artillery are
billeted, everything has a homelike ap
pearance. The men no longer suffered
from the cold winds, but sat around
glowing stoves, discussing the latest
news from the seat of war or played
ball in the wide lofts. Blankets in quan
tity bespoke of comfort, and three long
tables set with shining cups and plates
made their lot a little better than their
brother soldiers on the Presidio Reserva
tion.
A BIG MASS-MEETING.
Two Thousand Dollars Raised
for the Red Cross.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, May 15.
The rain undoubtedly kept many from
attending the Red Cross mass meeting at
the First Presbyterian Church this after
noon, but the attendance was beyond the
most sanguine expectations.
On the platform were Chairman G. H.
D. Gray, Chaplain Alfred S. Clark, of the
Seventh Regiment California Volunteer
Infantry, W. R. Davis. Robert Fitzgerald,
Mrs. O. M. Sanford, William Nat Friend,
Rev. J. F. Bushnell and Jamt-s H. Stevens,
the latter from San Francisco.
The collection taken at the close of the
meeting netted $500, making a total of $2000
raised in three days. On motion of Mrs.
\V. H. Friend, $100 was voted to the Sev
enth Regiment and paid to Captain Olark,
the regimental chaplain, to use as he saw
lit for the boys in his command. Mrs. J.
H. Bakewell moved that $9uo be given to
the regiments that would lirst start for
the Philippines. This was ordered, to be
used for emergencies without let or hin
drances.
The services were opened by singing tne
"Battle Hymn of the Republic' and
prayer by Noel H. Jacks, secretary of
the Young Men's Christian Association.
The chairman introduced Mrs. Sanford,
after explaining the aims of the order.
She spoke from the humane standpoint
and believed that the ladies would do all
that was required of them in this emer
gency as they had before.
Lieutenant Albert H. Elliott spoke on
behalf of the National Guard, and was en
thusiastically received. He expressed the
volunteers' thanks to the ladies who cared
so much for the welfare of the "boys.
He said the greatest work of the Red
Cross would come after the war in oaring
for the starving and distressed natives ot
the captured Spanish possessions.
J. H. Stevens paid a glowing tribute to
Dewey and the men who have thus far
fought so bravely for the flag.
Captain Clark, chaplain of the Seventh,
declared that within the past week he
had seen as much hardship endured In
ban Francisco as any he saw in th<3 civil
war and never a word had been uttered
by officer or private. "Those men who
came from Southern California," hÂ«; said,
â¢ were thinly clad, shoes not lit for this
weather, tents that leaked, the ground
water-soaked, stood on sentry duty with
out overcoats, soaked to the skin, and
never a word of complaint. I called upon
the surgeon of our regiment this morning,
and out of 1030 men he had treated 280 in
the last fDrtr-dght hours. Most of these
cases ;t.re due to the inclemency of vie
weather. There are cases there that de
mand a milk diet, and yet there Is not a
pint of milk on the reservation. They
need a strong operating table for the hos
pital tent.
"If we are going to do anything for
these soldiers do it right away. Don't
wait till next week nor next month. Do
it at once. In this righteous war, be
fore we unsheathed our swords, we
counted the cost, and we stand ready to
shed the blood necessary to accomplish
our purpose."
"\V. R. Davis urged his hearers to ac
tion and declared that the citizens of
this city would do their share without
stinting.
The Red Cross Society met at the close
of the mass meeting and heard the report
of the collection and decided upon the
gifts to be made to-morrow and other
matters. Ten bolts of muslin will be in
the drill hall of the church to-morrow,
which they hope to have made Into ban
dages before night. Mrs. Captain Oscar
F. Long reported that she had collected
sufficient funds to purchase 6wO alumi
num identification checks.
Making Comfort Bags.
The Christian Endeavorers of California
are undertaking to supply the soldiers
to leave San Francisco with comfort bags.
For years the Endeavorers, under their
floating committee, have been giving
these articles to the men In the navy, and
they have proved comfort bags indeed.
The bags are made of strong cloth, such
as linen, cretonne or ticking, and are
supplied with a small New Testament
carefully marked, a personal letter of
gof.d cheer, needles, pins, coarse black
and white thread, courtplaster, bandage
and vaseline, paper, envelopes and pencil.
Each bag is small and everything as com
pact as possible. The 700 societies in the
State are being notified of the move
ment to supply the men going to the
front, and it is expected that the soci
eties will respond promptly and gladly.
As many of the country societies may
not be able to get all the articles needed,
donations or money with which to pur
chase these articles will be thankfully re
ceived by Miss Berry at the Mission
extension headquarters, 760 A Harrison
street, San Francisco.
Remembered in the Churches.
A special musical service was held at
Grace Episcopal Church last night, and
the offertory, which amounted to a consid
erable sum, wil! be donated to the Red
Cross fund. -
The programme was excellent, the
special feature being the recessional "God
of Our Fathers," by Rudynxd Kipling, set
to music by Reginald de Koven, and ren
dered for the first time in this city. "The
Hymn to the Madonna" was sung by
special request.
Rev. R. C. Foute, through whose sug
gestion last night's service was devoted
to the Red Cross, made a short address
before the collection. He spoke of the
great need the soldier boys were in. and
said that it was not only a good thing to
do, but it was our dut*- to see that Â»iose
who go to fight for their country were
properly provided for.
Native Daughters Interested.
Alta Parlor, N. D. G. W., has Issued a
call for a mass meeting of all the mem
bers of all the sister parlors of the order
la Saa Francisco lor Tuesday, evening.
next' at Native Sons' Hall on Mason
street. The meeting is for the purpose of
arranging some plan of action so as to
act in unison with the Red Cross Society
in its work.
For the Red Cross.
"A hearty co-operation with our boys,
pioneers of truth, liberty. Christianity
and civilization, is what we must effect,"
said Rev. Robert Mackenzie of the First
Presbyterian Church in his evening lec
ture yesterday. "It is our duty to min
ister relief while they do the fighting.
Patriotism may be shown by us as well
as by the courageous men who are up
holding the honor of their country in a
war the inspiration of which is humanity
and love of country without a base or
mercenary motive. Contributions for the
Red Cross should be our cry.'
The Hospital Full.
The hospital established by the Red
Cross Society at the Presidio a few days
ago is already overtaxed, and yesterday
a requisition was made by the medical
officers of the troops now in camp at the
military reservation asking the society to
assist them in the care of the ill soldiers
in their charge by providing accommoda
tions for at least a dozen more patients.
The two trained nurses who volunteered
their services to the society, and who
were placed in charge of the patients
that were turned over to the society, have
more than they can attend to now, but
they are doing their best and doing it
cheerfully, much to the comfort of the
poor fellows who were unfortunate
enough to have been taken ill.
HOPE CERVERAS
WILL AVOID A FIGHT
Spanish Naval Authorities Realize
That Their Cape Verde Fleet
Is in Danger.
NEW YORK, May 15.â A dispatch to
the World from Cadiz says: The Span
ish naval authorities are devoutly
praying that Admiral Cervera's squad
ron, the Cape Verde fleet, will avoid
a fight with the superior force under
Admiral Sampson. They lament be
cause those four first-class armored
cruisers (Almirante Oquendo, Vizcaya,
Infanta Maria Teresa and Cristobal
Colon) and three torpedo-boats de
stroyers (Furor, Terror and Pluton)
were not ordered to join the reserve
fleet at Cadiz, if the Government hesi
tated in sending them to make a dash
for some North American point and
then wheel back to Spain, thus paralyz
ing the American defensive operations
about Cuba and Porto Rico.
The reserve fleet at Cadiz Is being
slowly prepared for service. Marines
and sailors have been assembled in
greater numbers than wanted for the
vessels ready. From political motives
and in order to make it appear to the
people that the Government is about to
take revenge for the Manila defeat, the
Madrid authorities have asked the na
val officers at Cadiz what vessels of
war can be made ready soon to pro
tect the transports carrying 6000 men
to Manila.
General Correa, the War Minister, got
seven battalions and four batteries
ready, all armed, equipped and officered
and large steamship companies under
took to provide the eight ships re
quired. But the naval authorities re
port that it would be impossible to get
war vessels ready quickly. They say
the battleship Pelayo is not fit for an
expedition to the far east, and, besides
that, she is seeded more for the re
serve squadron at home. For the same
reasons they object to parting with the
Carlos V, Cardinal Cisneros and Al
fonso XIII, first-rate cruisers.
Moreover, they do not think the sec
ond and third rate cruisers here which
are availableâ three in allâ would be
enough to protect the expedition from
the forces Admiral Dewey will have at
his disposal at the time Spanish re-en
forcements could reach Manila.
The torpedo boat destroyers â three
here at Cadiz and two at Ferrol â they
want to keep for the defense of the
coast, together ivith the torpedo ves
sels and the old ironclads Numancia
and Vittoria, lately repaired and re
fitted in French arsenals at great cost.
Unless the popular outcry overcomes
the professional and competent objec
tion, the Government will have to
abandon the idea of sending a relief
expedition to the Philippines.
THE ANNEXATIONISTS
MUST WAIT A WHILE.
Matters of More Vital Concern Will
Occupy the Time of Congress
This Week.
WASHINGTON, May 15.â The most
notable event in the House proceedings
for the present week will be the introduc
tion of the resolutions providing for the
annexation of Hawaii. The Committee
on Foreign Affairs has decided to report
favorably the resolution, and will do so j
probably on Tuesday. A very large ma- ;
jority of the Republican and, it is
claimed, fifteen Democratic members,
favor, the proposition and would like to
take immediate action, but the considera
tion will be postponed likely until after
this week.
It is urged by those who "oppose im
mediate consideration that the passage
of the resolution now would complicate
the situation as respects the revenue
bill and would delay greatly the passage
of the latter. Speaker Reed and Repre
sentative Dlngley are opposed to annexa
tion as a proposition, and the latter is
especially opposed to passing the measure
before action upon the revenue bill iv
taken.
On Wednesday the Banking and Cur
rency Committee will present, pursuant
to the vote concluded Saturday, a general
banking and currency bill, but it is
understood that it will not be considered
this week. Final action on any currency
measure at this session seems improb
able.
Of the appropriation bills in conference
some progress seems to have been made
in the sundry civil and postoffice bills and
one or both may be passed, though there
is a disposition to delay them in confer
ence until the revenue bill is well under
way in the Senate. The House com
mittee is ready to report the general de
ficiency bill and may bring it in this
week. A bill to establish a non-partisan
labor commission, suggesting appropriate
legislation affecting labor, may be con
sidered this week.
