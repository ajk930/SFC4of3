VOLUME LXXXV.-KO. 22.
DUNNING PLEADS THAT
HE SEEKS JUSTICE, NOT
REVENGE, UPON MRS. BOTKIN
Purged of Contempt toy
the Courtesy of the
Defense.
IT -was a day of varied interest at the
trial yesterday of Mrs. Cordelia Rotkin.
The prosecution closed its case and the
defense announced that it will be ready
to procec-d this morning with the intro
duction of testimony, the right to make
an opening argument to the jury being
â waived. John P. Dunning was again
made yesterday the central figure of
interest. He was brought into
court in the custody of the Sheriff,
after a night in the County Jail. He was
placed on the witness stand, and George
Knight, to the surprise of those interested
in the trial of the case, withdrew his de
mand for the names of ihe women with
whom Dunning claimed to have been in
timate.
The cross-examination of Dunning then
proceeded to the close, and something of
Knight's purpose in releasing Dunning
was seen in the result. It is seldom that
a man is forced to make a public confes
sion of personal dishonor and shame such
as John P. Dunning made yesterday of
himprlf in the presence of h':n<lr>-'i]s of
listening men and women. lie admitted
that he had lived upon the bounty of his
mistress, accepting her money, sharing
her food and her home, existing upon her
resources and thriving upon her means.
He declared that she had shown him
more than charityâ that she had cared for
him, counseled with him for reformation
and divided with him the food that she
d for herself. "When distress came
to her she still clung to the man with
whom she was fascinated and gave to
him what she should have retained for
herself.
More than this, the witness declared
Mrs. Botkin had never, not even by in
sinuation, suggested to him to seek a di
from his wifp. This jealous, un
moral mistress knew that her lover never

knew she felt no resentment at the ties
that kept him away from her and led
him to other fields and another home.
testimony, under cross-examination.
startled the courtroom. Dunning appeared
more a.Â« a witness for the defense than
ie prosecution. He presented an ab
ject figure, hut his humiliation seemed to
. more keenly by his hearers than by
himself.
There was an air of conscious boast
fulness in his manner when he declared
that he had been intimate with three
women whose names he would not give.
The defense has already shown that it
3 to make much of this secrecy and
to insinuate that perhaps one "f these
women may have committed the crime
of which Mrs. Botkin Is accused. The
defenders of Mrs. Botkin are grasping at
straws, and even the suggestion of
â  secrecy or mystery is in their
hands a weapon as strong as an estab
lished fact.
During the afternoon Attorney Mc-
Gowan made a spectacle of himself.
Knight was ill, and MeGowan undertook
the task of cross-examination. He suc
ceeded in disgusting the court and in
elevating Dunning to a plane of compara
tive decency. MeGowan carried his ques
tions in relation to the intimacy between
Mrs. Botkin and Dunning to the point of
indecency, and Judge Cook angrily de
clared that he would sustain any objec
tion made to fhat sort of an Inquiry. A -
sistant District Attorney Hosmer
shrugged his shoulders and replied that
he had no wish to interrupt the plan of
the defense as interpreted by Mr. Mc-
Gowan.
It was then that Mrs. Botkin's lawyer
elicited from Dunning the most damaging
testimony he had given against the ac
cused woman. McGowan demanded to
know and was informed why Dunning is
hostile to Mrs. Botkin. Dunning replied
that he came here with no thought of
vengeance on the woman. He came with
no hatred toward her. but with a sense
of duty he owed to his dead and a
purpose to compensate, as far as he may.
for the offenses in the past. He was con
vinced that Mrs. Botkin was concerned
in the death of his wife, and he begged
McGowan to believe that it was duty, not
l a ; ure that impelled him to become the
accuser of Mrs. Botkin. McGowan was
Sot even satisfied with the effect of his

Occasionally the writer would express
some term of endearment, but not by any
means an extravagant one. He wished
his mistress well, and told her in passing
what was happening at the seat of war.
On August 13 Dunning wrote his last
letter to his paramour. He was at the
city of Ponce, in Porto Rico, and drove
three miles in a carriage to the seaside
postofflce to mail his epistle of affection.
Having mailed his letter he returned to
Ponce and went without delay to the
cable ofllce. He there found waiting for
him a cablegram telling him that his
wife had been poisoned and was dead. His
offense to his home and his family had
borne its fruit.
Dunning was then released from the
witness stand. Judge Cook then set aside
his own order confining Dunning to the
County Jail. In committing the witness
to the custody of the Sheriff Judge Cook
declared that he had simply done his
duty. A question had been asked by the
defense and the questioner was entitled
under the law to an answer. With the
withdrawal of the question there was no
further reason for punishment. The ques
tion had been of such a character, the
Judge continued, that he did not feel that
he should inflict a fine as well as impris
onment. He therefore ordered Dunning
released from custody.
The prosecution had very little more to
The San Francisco Call
; offer. Before Dunning went on the stand
! Carl Eisenschimmel held the attention
of the court and jury. As an expert on
handwriting Eisenschimmel went over the
; old familiar ground of dots and dashes,
hooks and curves and all the dreary tech
; nical detail of the critical analysis of
; handwriting. From every consideration
1 EisenFchlmmel declared his positive be
lief that Mrs. Botkin wrote the anony
mous letters, the note in the box of can
dy and the address on the package of
poisoned sweets.
Attorney Knight offered the expert a
specimen of handwriting and asked if it
were in the handwriting of Mrs. Dunning.
Eisenschimmel was not to be trapped and
demanded time out of court in which to
make a thorough investigation. It is an
old trick of the experts to deceive experts
with clever forgeries, but Eisenschimmel
is familiar with the game.
He had not been so careful, however,
the day before, when he quietly slipped
into the gallery of the courtroom and lis-
I to the testimony of Expert Ames.
Eisenschimmel vehemently protested that
he had no ulterior purpose, but the fact
remained that he had gone to the court
room, and the defense was glad that the
fact had been discovered. Theodore Kytka
was the last handwriting expert placed on
the witness stand by the prosecution.
Kytka had made a series of photographs
: of the exhibits in the case and had made
; the customary critical analysis. He also
was positive that Mrs. Botkin wrote all
I the letters and the addresses. After a
cross-examination that was of no conse- I
quence Kytka was relieved. The prosecu- j
tion placed Chief Lees and Harry Pen- !
nington on the stand to close small gaps
in the chain of evidence and then the As- I
slstant District Attorney announced that '
the case for the people was closed. As '
Attorney Knight was not present the de- j
tense couia not proceed. MeGowan an
nounced that the defense will be ready !
this morning and an adjournment was '
taken until then.
Upon the opening of court Mr. Hosmer
the prosecuting officer, asked for the dis
missal of the case against J. G. Edwards
charged by Andrew J. Clunie wltn libel'
Mr. Edwards printed the alleged libelous
articles in his Insurance paper Judge
Cook dismissed the charge at the request
of Mr. Clunie, the complainant.
John P. Dunning was in the courtroom,
but not being called retired to the Judge's
chambers. He remained within call
Carl Eisensehimmel, the writing expert
resumed his exposition of the peculiarities
of Mrs. Botkin's handwriting. He first
took up the quotation marks in the
â¢â¢l.ahy" note and dissected them, finally
reaching the conclusion that they bore all
the characteristics of Mrs. Botkin's hand
writing. In the letter "C" he found a
certain angularity which is in all Mrs. '
Botkin's writinp. In one specimen of i
Mrs. Botkin's known handwriting, that of i
her Healdsburg address, given Mrs. Price, j
there were four "cs" and all had this' j
characteristic angularity. The anony
mous letters, he said, were falrl bris- â 
tling with evidences of Mrs. Botkin's
handwriting with but feeble attempt at
disguise.
Tin "se" in "please" was written by
her, being identical with standards of her
writing. These two letters were invarla- !
bly written off the line, and much higher
than any others. This is apparent in her
known writing, according to the expert.
There is a decided difference of slant be- |
tween the "p" and "1" that Is noticeable
throughout her writing, the "p" being al
most vertical and the "1" slanting.
"I call your attention to the word
"Madam," " said tho expert. "Compare
SAN FRANCISCO, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 22, 1898.
! the 'd' in that word to the one in
'madam' in this other letter. Note the
similarity of the *d' in those cases. That
'd' is produced in a peculiar manner, such
as I have never seen before."
To the jurors, producing a microscope:
; "I will give a brief description of this in
strument."
Knightâ You needn't; we don't want it.
The expert ran counter to Knigwt short
ly after when he told the jurors it was
not necessary to use the glass to note
what he desired to show them.
Knightâ Who do you mean does not finl
it necessary?
The expertâ l do not.
Knight â You are not in this testimony.
The expert then drew attention to tne
1 letter "c" made by Mrs. Botkin. He spoke
of its abnormal size, being double the
height of any other space letter. To Ju
ror J. F. Myers he said it was impossible
to judge of handwriting by form alone,
and that the peculiarities ran through
both capitals and small letters.
In conclusion, the export said he thought
' he had established to the jury his belief
that all the handwriting in evidence had
; been written by the same person.
In the course of a harsh cross-examina
tion Knight elicited the information that
[ Eisenschimmel occupied a place In the
\ gallery of the courtroom while his col
. league, Expert Ames, was on the witness
stand. The expert said that what he
meant by the "pen habit" and "writing
habit" was the habitual manner in which
writing was produced. He explained that
paying tellers of banks were experts in a
| certain way. They look at a check and
i get an impression by which they are able
| to judge as to genuineness, but cannot
! explain how they reach that conclusion.
"Mrs. Botkin has positive peculiarities
i or characteristics," said the expert.
Q.â Well, what do you find? A.â She
' writes the angular or so-called English
1 hand.
Q.â What kind of arm movement? A.â
Partly finger, partly forearmâ a combined
i movement.
Q,â Find any characteristics of Mrs.
; Botkin's handwriting? A.â Yes, many of
I them.
Q. â Give one. A. â In the word "place"
1 the letter "p" has one slant and the "1"
; another.
Q.â That is a Botkin characteristic?
' A.â Not in every case. There Is no rule.
Q.â ls this the first time in your life
'â  you ever saw a "p" and an "1" that
looked anything like those? A.â Yes.
The witness said that the "baby" note
was In Mrs. Botkin's handwriting, the
i only attempt at disguise being in the
: slant of the letters. He was handed a
I piece of paper by Mr. Knigrrt, but de
l clined to touch it or pass upon it, saying
! it was not an exhibit in the case. Knight's
1 efforts to force the witness to express an
i opinion offhand as to the writing brought
i Hosmer to the rescue and developed some
! more of the schoolgirl repartee which has
| enlivened the proceedings from time to
[ time.
"Don't interrupt me when I am talk
ing," said Hosmer. "Some one else has a
right to be heard here besides you."
"Well, you've been talking for two
days," was the rejoinder.
When the expert retired finally Judge
Cook said: "Call John P. Dunning." To
the latter he said: "Mr. Dunning, it Is
the desire of the court that you should
have an opportunity, at least every
twenty-four hours, of reconsidering your
determination not to answer the question
put to you by Mr. Knight on Monday."
Turning to Mr. Knight he said: "Mr.
Knight, do you insist upon the question?"
After a ghort conference with his asso
ciates Mr. Knipht said: "May It please
the court, I will withdraw the request for
the names of the ladies."
The Courtâ Proceed with the cross
examination.
Knightâ Mr. Dunning, you say there are
six women with whom you were on inti
mate terms whose names you do not re
member. How many are there whose
names you remember, but do not wish
to give? A.â Three.
Q.â Do you know Mrs. Corboley, and
did you have any business relations with
her? A.â She loaned money to myself
and Mrs. Dunning. It was $800 in all.
The witness said he wrote to Mrs. Bot
kin while on the train between here and
DUNNINQ DECLARED THAT HE SOUGHT NOT VENGEANCE BDT JUSTICE.
John P. Dunning is again at liberty. The legal defenders of Mrs. Botkin withdrew their question in
reference to the man's gay companions, and he was released from the County Jail. Under cross-examination
yesterday he declared dramatically that he sought to satisfy no vengeance on Mrs. Botkin, but was a witness
simply from a sense of duty and with a purpose to compensate as far as he may for his past life. He was con
vinced, he said, that Mrs. Botkin was concerned in the death of his wife, and inspired by that conviction be
came a witness.
New York. He wrote again between that
point and Tampa, Fla. In answer to fur
ther questions he said he did not remem
ber ever having suggested to Mrs. Bot
kln that she ko to New York and live.
He did not remember ever telling her that
he would like to have her there.
He telegraphed his wife before he left
here, and again had a friend apprise her
of his coming when he reached Chicago.
Q.â Why did you write to Mrs. Bot
kin? A.â l told her I would, and knew
she expected to hear from me
Q._When you left Mrs. Botkin at
Oakland there was no rupture between
you? There was no good-by forever, this
is all off, or anything of that kind, was
there? A.â No: there was no rupture.
I understood in my own mind that I was
not coming back to San Francisco, but
I did not tell Mrs. Botkin so.
Dunning again told in outline of the
contents of the anonymous letters; about
him drinking himself to death; of the life
he had led in this city, and of his finan
cial difficulties not due no'eiy to his losses
upon the race track. His wife sent him
a copy instead of the original, but why
he did not know. He did not get the orig
inal and send It to Mrs. Bntkin. He had
never asked for the original, although he
was interested in knowing who wrote it.
He' did not know why he had not asked
for It.
Q.â Did Mrs. Potkin ever express a de
sire to injure your wife or suggest that
you secure a divorce? A.â She never ex
pressed such a desire nor made such a
suggestion.
yâ Did not she divide her last morsel
of broad with you when you were at 927
Geary street? A.â She did.
Q.â Didn't she nearly starve with you
when you had hardly a boiled rag be
tween you? A.â Yes, sir.
Q.â She gave you money to assist you
which she received from her husband?
A.â She gave me money; I don't know
whore she got it.
Q.â She sent you money to Salt Lake to
bring you home, where you could get an
other position? A.â She did.
Q.â When you left here you wrote three
or four letters to her and sent one tele
gram to your wife? A.â Yes. sir.
On redirect examination Mr. Hosmer
drew from him the information that he
had spent considerable money on Mrs.
Botkin's pleasures. He also testified
that he knew of only two anonymous let
ters until after his wife's death. Witness
said he never told Mrs. Botkln to come
to New York. Upon his return from the
war he purposed having his family join
him. and they were to make their home
in Now York. The witness said he had
no letters written him by Mrs. Botkin; he
had destroyed them all. He had received
no letter from her since the death of his
wife. He had received answers to all hia
except the last one he sent.
Defenders of the Accused
to Open Their Case
This Morning.
Message of Death That Followed
Close Upon a 7Wissi\/e
of Love.
The hour for adjournment having ar
rived Judge Cook addressed Dunning and
said that although he had been guilty of
contempt of court in refusing to answer
a question when directed to do so by the
court, yet his Honor did not think it was
a case where further punishment should
be inflicted, especially when Mr. Knight
had voluntarily withdrawn his question.
Dunning was, therefore, purged of his
contempt and set at liberty.
Dunning was the first witness of the
afternoon. In answer to Mr. Hosmer he
said Mrs. Corboley was an intimate friend
of his family. They were born near one
another in the South on the border line
between Maryland and Delaware. Their
families had known one another for years.
She was much older than he and was an
Intimate friend of his wife. He said none
of the exhibits of writing In evidence re
sembled hers.
In the absence of Attorney Knight Sen
ator Frank McGowan took the witness
through a severe cross - examination.
Dunning said that Mrs. Botkin knew Mrs.
Corboley as a friend of Mrs. Dunning.
He had told her so when telling her of
the financial transaction between them.
He had never had any intimacy or rela
tion whatever with Mrs. Corboley except
this.
Regarding Mrs. Calimbertie he said he
had but a slight acquaintance with her.
The writing was not hers. Asked
as to why he mentioned her name
to his wife he said it was because he
wanted to give a plausible excuse. He
first thought of Mrs. Seeley, but to men
tion her name would be to entangle him
self in a maze from which he might find
it hard to extricate himself.
McGowan asked If he had sustained
any intimacy with Mrs. Calimbertie and
Punning said he had not.
McGowanâ lf you had would you tell?
Witnessâ l would decline to answer.
He said he had deceived his wife and
had written her falsehoods, as he had to
get out of the trouble brought on by the
anonymous letters. Asked as to why he
had not told her some one else he replied
he had thought of no one else at the time.
He knew it was false and knew it was ar
injustice to this woman to point the finger
of suspicion at her, but at the moment
he thought it would never come out.
Q.â Did you suspect Mrs. Seeley? A.â l
thought she had ill feeling aginst me.
Q._For what reason? A.â About four
months before Mrs. Botkin wrote her an
insulting letter. She knew of the intimate
relations existing between Mrs. Botkin
and myself, and I thought she might have
suspected me of instigating it.
Q. â Did you know Mrs. Seeley was an
enemy?. A.â l had no other reason for
thinking she was.
Q.â Why did you not mention Mrs. See
ley's name to your wife? A.â Because it
woul* expose the relations existing be
tween Mrs. Botkin, Mrs. Seeley and my
self.
Q.â You wanted to shield yourself? A.â
I certainly did; that was the main reason
I put the blame on Mrs. Calimbertie. I
had to give some name that would ap
pear plausible to my wife.
Q.â You knew of the trouble between
Mrs. Botkin and Mrs. Beeley? A.â l did.
Q.â Was it directed against you? A.â
No; it was on- account of contemplated
divorce proceedings between Mr. Botkin
and wife.
Q.â You speak of close intimacy. What
do you mean by that expression? A.â l
told you at length of the life led by my
self and Mrs. Botkin. I tried to avoid
speaking too plainly.
Q.â Well, what was Its nature? A.â lt
was improper. Do you want further an
swer?
Q.â l want an answer. A.â My rela
tions with Mrs. Botkin were such as a
married man has no right to have with a
married woman or any other woman. (A
long pause.) I have been with her and
have remained over night In her apart
ments.
The court here interposed an objection
in the name of decency and the question
ing on that line ceased.
The witness was asked as to a feeling
of hostility he bore toward Mrs. Botkin.
He said he had such a feeling, but it was
not one looking toward vengeance. He
came here as a witness to "condone" for
the faults of his past life of excess.
Q.â When did this feeling of hostility

portant happening several months ago.
It came within one hour after I reached
Dover and learned of the circumstances
surrounding the death, of my wife and my
sister-in-law. Their death by poisoned
candy directed my suspicions toward Mrs.
Botkin. Up to that moment I had no
suspicions against Mrs. Botkin. The first
telegram only told me of her death by
supposed confectionery poisoning. I had
no suspicions against any one else, al
though I told the officers of the law that
Mrs. Ruoff and the druggist who sold the
arsenic might be useful witnesses. I re
ferred to Mrs. Ruoff as a witness and not
as a principal. I knew of her confiden
tial relations with Mrs. Botkin.
Q.â Explain your hostility toward Mrs.
Botkin. A.â lt arises because of the death
of my wife.
Q.â What was the first thing to cause
you to think of Mrs. Botkin in connection
with the poisoning of your wife? A. â Be

previously between us and o* the feeling

The witness learned of his wife's death
at 6p. m. August 13. An hour before that
time he drove to Ponce, Porto Rico, and
mailed a letter to Mrs. Cordelia Botkin
in this city. This was the last communi
cation of any character Dunning has had
since* that moment with the woman now
on trial for her life. The letter reads:
PONCE, Porto Rico, August 13. 1898.
Dear Ada: I have been here about dead
to the world for two or three weeks, with
out any means of getter any mall and .
" very- little chance of getting any away.
Just before I left Kingston I wrote you
ask ins: you to address me at St. Thomas,
but have never been there yet. having coma
here direct, and I have received no mall.
We got the news to-day that peace had
been declared, and I suppose I will be go
ing to New York soon, but I know nothing
particular about it. I will have to send
you an address when I get to New York,
and you had better not send any more mail
to St. Thomas, as I will probably not go
there now. This is the must beautiful
island I have ever seen, and I have been
almost constantly in the saddle since I
have been here, wearing holes in my
anatomy. I am really sorry the war Is
over, for I have certainly enjoyed It and
I am in considerable uncertainty about the
kind of work I will do when I get to New

With my love, j *
Theodore Kytka.'pen artist and photo
grapher, succeeded Dunning in the wit
ness chair. He was shown the various
examples of handwriting, and without go
ing into the customary painful expla
nations, testified that they were in Mrs
Botkin handwriting. He was taken
through a profitless cross-examination by
Attorney C. M. Wheeler of Humboldt
who gave a clever imitation of George
Knight in one particular. He could lean
as gracefully on the rail of the witness
stand as Mrs. Botkin's leading attorney
The resemblance ceased there. He drew
from the witness the statement that the
wrapper from the candy box had been
ironed out. He had forgotten that Chief
Lees had testified to this early in tna
trial. He then tried to prove by the wit
ness that the passaage of the iron over
the paper had changed its appearance en
tirely. The most the witness would ac
knowledge was that the ironing had not
removed the original creases but had
merely leveled them.
Mr. Hosmer then placed Chief Lees on
the stand to explain how he had done the
terrible washing and ironing to which the
bit of paper had been subjected. "Mr."
Lees, as Senator McGowan persisted in
calling him, told how he had handled tha
wrapper. The venerable Police Chief, who
looks more and more like a real flesh and
blood Santa Claus, was cross-examined
to no purpose.
"If your Honor please," said Mr. Hos
mer, "the prosecution rests its case."
Judge Cookâ Let the defense proceed.
Mr. McGowan then addressed the court,
saying the defense did not expect the
prosecution to conclude at so early an
hour and was not prepared to place its
â witnesses on the stand at that time Ha
asked that the case go over until th's
morning. He said the defense would waive
its right to an opening statement, but re
served the right to call Mrs. Harris for
further cross-examination.
Judpre Cook agreed to the continuance
saying the trial was making most satis
factory progressâ that sixty-eight wit
nesses had been examined in seven days.
The defense will commence its presenta
tion of Mrs. Botkins case at 10 o'clock2

THE GOOD NAME OF
THE STATE IN DANGER
COMMERCIAL BODIES RALLY
FOR PURE PRODUCTS.
Will Demand More Stringent Laws
and Vigilant Officers of the
Legislature.
The recent action of Germany in legis
lating against California fruits and in
condemning and destroying a large con-
Bignment of pears shipped from this city
by a local commission house because of
the allege, l discovery of infection on the
fruit, followed by the condemnation and
destruction of a lot of Northern California
wines in Mexico, has aroused the commer
cial bodies of this city to the necessity
of taking some action to maintain the
reputation that California has had here
tofore for her many products.
To reach some conclusion as to what
should be done a meeting was held on
sday at which representatives of all
the exporting houses in the city were
â it. It was decided to ask the 1.
lature to enact new laws and to amend
those in existence so that no impure foods
and produi ts, imperfect fruits or "doc
tored" wines or liquors could be sent out
of the State.
The exporters were so much in earnest
that they declared that if the law-makers
would not take hold of the matter in the
proper spirit the commission houses
would organize, send an inspector into
tlie country to ascertain the condition of
every orchard and pass upon the condi
tion of every product offered for export.
Any orchardlst found with uni-lean trees
would be boycotted until he put his or
chard in perfect condition.
The same subject was also considered
by the Board of Regents of the State Uni
versity at its meeting Tuesday and like
conclusions were reached. Yesterday the
Council of Associated Industries met in
the Mills building and representatives
were present from the Manufacturers' and
Producers' Assuciatlon, Chamber of Com
merce, State Hoard of Trade, Mechanics'
Institute, the Hoard of Kegents and of
the exporters mentioned. The matter was
consldi red at length and considerable at
tention was paid to the bill prepared by
the pure foods committee of the Manu
facturers' and Product rs' Association that
is to be presented to the next Legislature.
This measure provides for a pure foods
bureau or commission. It is believed that
with some little modification it will meet
with all the requirements of the export
ers and those interested in the move
ment. Another meeting will be held next
Thursday to perfect the proposed bill, so
as to have it ready for introduction on
the convening of the next Legislature.

JUNK SHOP IS CONDEMNED.
Board of Health Seeks to Abate a
Nuisance.
M. D. Levinson, a junk dealer, who has
hip place of business on Brannan street,
between Seventh and Eighth, will appear
before Police Judge Mogan this morning
to answer a charge of maintaining a pub
lic nuisance and to a half dozen other
charges preferred by the Board of Health.
Levinson has been a source of trouble
to the Health Board for some weeks past.
Back of his Brannan-street rookery he
has a full acre of ground covered two feet
deep with muck and rubbish of every
smelling description that his six wagons
have brought in from all sections of the
city. The place has never been cleaned
since ho first began business, and the
early rains have caused a fermentation
that is neither pleasant nor healthy.
The attention of the board was first
called to the nuisance by people living in
the neighborhood, and since that time
Levinson has been time and again or
dered to clean up. He has failed to do so,
and proceedings have been begun against
him with the intention of compelling him
to move his pesthole outside the city
limits.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 22, 1898.
TWO FOOTPADS
LANDED AFTER
A HARD CHASE
Held Up a Citizen on
Broderick Street.
BOTH ARE VERY YOUNG MEN
SEVERAL SHOTS FIRED AT ONE
Of THEM.
Said to Be the Robbers Who Have
Been Operating Recently
in the Western
Addition.
Through the efforts of Policemen Her
ring and Stanton tue two footpads who
have been operating in the Western Ad
dition for several weeks past are locked
up in me City Prison. Their names are
Charles Reagan, aged 23 years, and Fred
Hall, aged 18 years.
Shortly alter 8 o'r.'-ock last night Jo
seph Muni>ck, who lives at 2032 Golden
Gate avenue, while oh his way home. was
stood up by the two young men at the
point of a pistol and robbed of a silver
watch and a package of tobacco. The
robbery occurred within a few feet of his
home. After relieving Murdock of his
timepiece and tobacco the desperate rob
bers threatened to kill him if he made an
outcry, and leisurely walked 'along Golden
Gate avenue.
A short time afterward Policeman Stan
ton saw the men acting suspiciously on
Broadway, between Flllmure and Web
ster streets. As he had been notified of
the hold-un, and suspecting that they
were the culprits, he decided to search
them. Hall had a revolver in his hip
pocket, and as the officer discovered.it he
broke away from him and ran down the
street. Stanton clung to Reagan, and,
taking out his revolver, called upon Hall
to stop. The latter, in his anxiety to es
cape arrest, dropped his hat.
Policemen McNamara and Davits, who
were in citizens' clothes, seeing the foot
pad dashing madly along tne street, or
dered him to halt. As he continued run
ning Davits drew his pistol and fired two
sho!s at him. but failed to bring him
down. At Green and Octavla streets Hall
encountered Policeman Herring. Suspect
ing that he had committed some crime
Herring started toward him, intending to
question him. The desperate robber
reached for his revolver, and as. he did
bo the policeman quickly drew his weapon
and ordered him to throw up his hands.
Seeing that the officer had him covered.
Hall reluctantly obeyed.
Herring promptly seized him and at
once relieved him of his revolver.
In answer to the officer's questions Hall
said he was on his way home when he
was attacked by two men. one of whom
thrust a revolver in his face after threat
ening to riddle him with bullets if be
made an outcry. According to his story
they then searched his pockets, taking
a silver watch and a small amount of
money. Convinced that he was lying the
policeman snapped his handcuffs on him
and took him to the North End station..
Stanton and his prisoner had preceded
them and as the officer positively identi
fied Hall as the man who had broke away
from him the sergeant in charge ordered
them taken to the office of the Chief of
Police. In answer to the questions of the
head of the department Hall said he was
a waiter, but had. not workeu for several
months. His accomplice in crime boast
fully declared that he "didn't have to
work," as he had "money to burn."
â¢After considerable questioning he finally
admitted that he had arrived from Chi
cago about three weeks ago. He said
that he and Hall lived together in a
lodging house on Mission street, between
Fifth and Sixth, the number of which he
did not know. In his pockets were found
a number of skeleton keys.
Subsequently Murdock, who was held
up by the desperate men, visited police
headquarters, for the purpose of identify
ing them. After carefully scrutinizing
them he said that they looked like the
men, but as he was so excited at the
time he was not willing to swear that
they were the robbers. The package of
tobacco which was taken. from Murdock
was found in Hall's pocket. They were
charged with robbery, and it Is expected
that several additional charges will be
recorded against them to-day.
SANTA CLAUS BREAKS
THE HOLIDA,' RECORD
SALES OF CHRISTMAS GOODS
THE LARGEST KNOWN.
San Francisco Merchants Reap a
Harvest â Good Fairies Bring
a Rush to Their Stores.
The San Francisco record for spending |
money was broken yesterday. Never be
fore In a single day did the merchants
sell as many goods as they sold yester
day.
The conditions were favorable for break
ing the record. Rain reports from a very
large area of the State tended to restore
confidence and give assurance of a good
season to come. The bright sunshine and ;
.agreeable temperature following the rain j
and the the fog invited shoppers to go
forth.
The attractions of the Christmas dis
play of holiday goods tempted the admir
ing throng and the presence of money in
the purse and Christmas spirit in the \
heart cyd the rest. Money was lavishly
expended in the purchase of seasonable
gifts and so the warehouse of Santa Claus
is stored with innumerable treasures
which will impart joy to the young and
the old on Christmas day.
The aggregate of the sums expended
yesterday cannot be given, but a mer
chant of the highest standing, whose fa
etlittes are ample for obtaining knowl
edge of the day's business in holiday '
goods, is authority for the statement that
yesterday's retail trade was the biggest
on record in this city.

DR. STEBBINS IMPROVING.
A Decided Change For the Better
Noted in His Condition.
There was a decided change for the bet
ter in the condition of the Rev. Horatio
Stebbins yesterday. The improvement
was the direct result of his having gained
considerable strength Tuesday night,
when he had a few hours of sleep. He
took some nourishment during the day,
and Dr. Ellinwood. his physician, is very
honeful of his recovery, although he must
necessarily be kept quiet for many days
to come, as his condition is still critical.
The report that his illness was due to
heart disease is erroneous. Dr. Ellinwood
says that does not describe his condi
tion. His physician is disinclined to state
the exact nature of his disease, but the
fact that he is rallying will be cheering
news to the doctor's many friends.
At 10 o'clock last night Dr. Ellinwood
announced that his patient was very
much refreshed, and the indications were
extremely favorable. He had a good day,
and there is now no immediate danger.

WISH TO ACT AS THE
PRESIDENT'S ESCORT
YOUNG REPUBLICANS ORGANIZ
ING A DRILL CORPS.
Expect to Participate in the Inaugu
ration at Washington, D.
C, in 1901.
A number of members of the Tnion
League Drill Corns, which did valiant
service during the last campaign, are or
ganizing a Republican club with a view
to going to the inauguration at Wash
ington, D. C, in 1901. In aid of their
project an Interesting communication has
been mailed to desirable young men in
this city, inviting them to join and stat
ing the objects of lue proposed organiza
tion.
Of course the success of the project de
pends entirely upon the next President
being a Republican, but the originators
of the plan are -tain he will be, and
they want to act as his escort at the in
auguration.
The communication states that to carry
out this plan $15,0(X) is needed, and, al
though the sum is a large one, they be- I
lieve it can be raised among business
men who can appreciate the value of such
a trip as an advertisement to this State.
The membership of the club is not to
exceed 100, and every man must be a
gentleman, in the event the trip is taken :
it is proposed that a stop be made at Chi
cago', Philadelphia and New York, where !
arrangements can be made for competi- ;
tive or exhibition drills with similar or
ganzations in these cties.
Continuing, the notice says:
To show our good faith we have agreed to
pay $2 a month from January 1, 1599, to and
including Match, 1901, milking $54 each, or $5400
i for 100 men. This will be put safely away in
I a bank aÂ«d allowed to draw interest, and if
| not used for the purpose intended will be re
i funded. There Is also a provision in our agree
ment allowinKa memberto withdraw his money
If the club so votes. When the time comes to
go each man may be expected to buy his own
uniform, not. to exceed $3U. This depends, how

STATE FEE CASE IN
THE SUPREME COURT
CONTROLLER WANTS THE LAW
ON THE QUESTION.
Application for a Writ to Compel Him
to Settle Comes Up to Be
Heard To-Day.
There was a very important conference
yesterday between Attorney General Fitz
gerald, State Controller E. P. Colgan,
Deputy Controller TV. TV. Douglas and
Chief Justice Beatty of the Supreme
Court. The matter under consideration
was the payment to forty-three counties
of the State of commissions claimed to be
due them. These claims amount to about
a million a.nd a half dollars. Prior to
May, 1X93, county officers were allowed
fees or commissions for the collection of
the State's part of the taxes. In that
year the Legislature passed a law abol
ishing the act by which these fees were
allowed and since then no commissions
have been paid.
A few months ago Rodgers, Paterson
& Slack of this city and Devlin & Devlin
of Sacramento, representing the counties,
demanded the payment of the back com
missions for all of the years since 1893,
on the ground that the law abolishing
fees was improperly passed and therefore
void.
It is necessary for the county treasur
ers to settle their accounts with the State
between the lfith a.nd 30th of this month
and they propose to enforce the issue of
back commissions by tying up the money
due the State. The result of such a course
would be very disastrous for the State
Treasurer and hence the necessity of
prompt action in the matter.
The object of the conference yesterday
was to get the matter before the Supreme
Court at once, for if the case has to take
the usual course through the lower courts
It would cause great complications and
#clay. It was decided to take one county,
Sutter being selected, and petition for an
original writ of mandate to compel the
Controller to settle with the Treasurer
of the county. The Supreme Court will'
meet to-day to hear the arguments. If it
should decide to grant the application the
matter will be settled at once. If not State
and county finances will be mixed In a
most awkward manner.
NOTES OF THE WEATHER.
The Rain Has Brightened Prospects.
Yesterday the Shortest of
the Year.
Yesterday morning saw the end of the
rain in this State. A little began to fall
in San Diego at 5 a. m. It was only a
trace, however, the amount recorded be
i Ing .01. At 8 o'clock It was raining at
Portervllle, Bakersfield and Caliente, the
precipitation being respectively .22, .08 and
.43. As stated in yesterday's Call the
weather was clear yesterday In this city.
. The storm is now in the British Posses
â  sions, just north of North Dakota.
The rainfall for the twenty-four hours
I ending Wednesday morning was 1.20 in
' San Francisco; 1.70 in Sacramento; Red
Bluff, .60; Fresno, .11. The fall in the Sa
i Unas Valley will not benefit that dry
section very much. There was a lifiit
frost last night and this morning, but
not enough to cause any material damage.
It snowed In all the Sierra and foothill
regions.
Reports from Tuolumne, Calaveras,
Placer and other mining counties say
heavy rains have fallen in those sections,
and the dry creeks there have been turned
into raging torrents. This will improve
mining prospects vastly for the ensuing
year. Farmers everywhere are greatly
pleased with the precipitation, as crop
prospects are also brightened.
According to the schools yesterday was
the shortest day in the year. The sun
reached the end of his annual trip south
of the line and turned northward again,
and now the days will begin to lengthen
slowly.

Death Valley, by a woman survivor
of the awful trip, in next Sunday's

INDIAN RAID ON
A MINER'S CABIN
Structure Looted and
Burned.
CALAVERAS COUNTY CRIME
REDSKIN THIEVES MAKE A
BOLD DESCENT.
Are Pursued by a Posse of Enraged
Whites, but Succeed in Mak
ing Good The>~
Escape.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ANGELS CAMP, Dec. 21.â Meager
reports reached angels Camp to-night
of the looting and burning of a house
by a party of Indians in the northeast
part of this county. The scene of the
crime is sixteen miles north of Val
lecito, where a party of placer miners
is at work. A band of Indians from
Nevada has .been encamped near this
place for the past two weeks and has
been hunting and fishing in the neigh
borhood. The red men made no trouble
until last Friday afternoon.
While the miners were at work they
noticed a thin wreath of smoke arising
from the trees where their cabin stood.
One o,f their number cautiously made
his way through the timber to the
fence surrounding the house and when
within about a hundred yards of thj
building halted and crawled the bal
ance of the way. The house was in
ilames, and through the dense smoke
the watcher could see a number of
forms going in and out between the
trees. He could not distinguish faces,
but was satisfied they were Indians.
Returning to his comrades he gave
the alarm and the entire party rushed
to the scene. The incendiaries had es
caped.
An investigation developed the fact
that the entire contents of the house
had been stolen by the Indians. Cloth
ing, mining tools and other articles to
the value of $1500 had been taken.
The miners at once organized a posse
and started in hot pursuit of the flee
ing Indians. The trail was closely, fol
lowed, but the Indians were too far in
advance and the angry miners were
unable to overtake them. They re
turned to the burned cabin and have
since been watching the trails closely.
The country where the raid occurred
is very rough and mountainous and dif
ficult of access. The news of the burn
ing of the miners' cabin reached Angels
Camp at 8 o'clock to-night, being
brought by a miner. He said the men
had no suspicion of trouble from their
Indian neighbors until the smoke of
their burning dwelling aroused them to
their danger.
ZANTE CURRANT FIGHT
WON BY CALIFORNIA
Greek Product Will Not Be Admitted
to This Country Free
of Duty.
"WASHINGTON, Dec. 21.â The Zante
raisin matter is settled. Special Com
missioner Kasson wrote to Senator
Perkins to-day that the California peo
ple misapprehended the President's
message; that he made no "recommen
dation" favoring free Zante currants;
but that the representations made by
the California fruit growers have
wholly done away with the Greek claim
to free admission of this fruit. The
results of this investigation seems likely
to establish the California claims on
stronger grounds than ever before, says
Kasson.

ago in California. In 1884 he came East
with the stable of "Lucky" Baldwin. At
one time Cooper was worth $65,000, part of
this being the proceeds of the sale of the
two-year-old Hyda Abad to James R.
Keene. After selling Peter the Great he
never owned a good horse. In recent
years his colors were seldom seen on a
track.
Victims of a Runaway Disaster.
THE DALLES, Or., Dec. 21.â Word was
received here late this afternoon of a
fatal accident at Rices Hill, fifteen miles
south of The Dalles. William Gardiner
and Miss Reese, who live near Liberty
School House, were coming to The Dalle's
to get married. While descending the
hill the team became unmanageable.
Both were thrown out and the young lady
was almost instantly killed. Gardiner re
ceived injuries which are believed to be
fatal.

Ei-eciai Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Dec. 21.
At the Cabinet meeting to-day, after
General Merritt had spent a brief time
with the President, the matter of In
structions to General Otis concerning
his military administration of affairs
in the Philippines was taken up. Later
in the day full instructions were pre
pared and mailed to General Otis. They
were not made public, and may not be
until they reach Manila, but from con
versations with Cabinet officers who
were present at this morning's confer
ence the tenor of these instruction?
may be given as follows:
Firstâ The purpose of the United
States Government to assume military
control over Philippine Island affairs
for an indefinite period was stated.
Secondâ That there will be no radical
departures from the local civil govern
ment now existing there.
Thirdâ The insurgents are ordered to
lay down their arms and become amen
able to United States laws, which will
be bettered from time to time, or as the
conditions and needs of the Filipinos
are better understood by our officers.
As heretofore stated in The Call's dis
patches, the President has determined
to continue the military government
over the Philippines during the re
mainder of his term of office. If, in
that period of probation, the Filipinos
have demonstrated their capability for
self-government, they may possibly be
come free and independent under the
protection of this Government. This
promise is held out to them.
COURSING AT SAN JOSF.
Newly Organized Club Will Hold Its
Initial Meet on Christmas.
SAN JOSE, Dec. 21.â Lovers of coursing
In this ci^y and county will be given op
portunities for enjoying- the sport in fu
ture. The San Jose Coursing Club has
been organized with a good membership,
and will hold its initial meet on Christ
mas day. Nearly $600 will be given in
purses. Over sixty entries have already
been received. These are from San Fran
cisco, Sacramento, Stockton and San Jose,
and include the swiftest dogs in the State.
Entries close on Friday, when the draw
ing will take place. The fee is $2 50. C.
H. Corey, the promoter of the club, has
added a purse of $150 to the entrance fees.
This will insure good money in the prizes.
Should entries continue to come in aa
now it will be necessary to continue the
racing on Monday following Christmas.
In this case there will be a consolation
stake offered that will attract attention.
Agricultural Park has been engaged and
has been turned into the largest and fin
est coursing park on the coast. The in
side of the track has been fenced with
laths, giving an area of thirty-six acres.
A errand stand has been erected in the
center. It is said that this arrangement
excels Ingleside, as every run and turn
of the dogs can be seen.
To-day Secretary Corey received twelve
dozen hares from the San Joaquin Valley.
The San Jose Coursing Club starts under
favorable auspices and intends tv arrange
for weekly meets.

ty-live rounds at the lightweight limit,
133 pounds, before the club offering the
best inducements, and also for a side bet
of $2000. In all probability the bout will
take place on the Pacific Coast some time

Some Secret History Revealing
Heroes Hitherto Name=
less.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 21.â The official I
reports of all commanding officers of j
the navy during the war have been
compiled and published by the Navy
Department. While treating of events
that have already figured in official re- '
ports that have reached the public the ]
documents still contain many minor re
ports that throw side lights on interest
ing phases of the war. Almost in the
beginning, in the brief record of the
proceedings of the naval wnr building
an unknown hero Is brought to light
In the person of Ensign H. H. Ward,
who at the beginning of the war was
on duty in the Navigation Bureau, al
ternating with Lieutenant Whittlesey
in the heavy duties of assistant to the
chief of the bureau. He volunteered j
for secret service duty and his exploits,
about which nothing has been said in i
the past, may well be placed on record
beside those of Lieutenant Rowan in
Cuba and Lieutenant Whitney in Porto I
Rico. Within a week after the declar- I
ati'>n of war Ensign Ward distln- i
guished himself and went straight into !
the heart of the enemy's country, mak- [
ing his headquarters at Cadiz, the prin- i
cipal Spanish naval station, and in- j
forming the Navy Department here of
the actual strength of the Spanish
naval vessels and their movements.
Then he went to the West Indies and
reported everything that was going on J
there of Importance to the American
navy. Next he went again into the j
enemies country in disguise, this time
to Porto Rico, where he was arrested
as a spy. By adroitness he managed
cure his release and, escaping
from San Juan, cable,! to the Navy De- j
nent a full account of the state \
of the defenses there and the prepara
making for the reception of the
Spanish squadron under Cervera. All
me even officials of the Navy
Department were under the impression
that Mr. Ward was engaged in install- i
ing a system of coast signals on the
New England oast.
While Ward was in Porto Rico. En- j
pign Buck, another attache of the
Navigation Bureau, was on the shores !
of the Mediterranean in disguise. ,
watching every movement of the i
Iron of Camara, which started for
the Philippines, l>ut turned back. Of
Strategy Board itself it is said that
it was part of its duty to keep informed i
of all of the movements, resources and '
plans of the Spanish naval forces j
through Becret agents, and it is now
known that the navy was thus inform- 'â 
c-d of all important movements. At I
however, information was con- !
Hiding and decisions had to be made
;is to which report was true. Under '
the head of precautionary orders ap- â 
pear in the volume of instructions to)
all the United States ships abroad to !
stork their bunkers with the best coal
obtainable and to keep them full.
Admiral Dewey was told long before
the declaration of war, on February 25:
"In th" event "f war with Spain your
duty will be to see that the Spanish
Bquadron does not leave the Asiatic
coast, and then begin offensive opera
tions in the Philippines. Keep Olvm
pla until further orders."
The latter order is explained by the
fact that the flagship had been ordered
back to the United States for overhaul
ing. Admiral Howell, in the Mediter
ranean with his squadron, was told to
â wait in neutral waters for orders, and
the ships in the South Atlantic were in-
Ptructed to move northward so as not
to excite suspicion.
The reports of the famous naval bat
tie of Cavite includes one from United
Statp? Consul Williams, a rather un
usual thing in a report of a strictly
naval character, but fully justified by
its picturesque and untechnical de
scription of Dewey'B great victory.
Following it Is a report to his Gov
ernment on the same engagement by
the commander-in-chief of the ill-fated
Spanish fleet, Montejo.
The admiral depicts the bad conditions
of the Spanish fleet and defenses. !]>â 
pays thai the cruiser ('astilla was in
capable of maneuvering on account of her
bad condition, while the defenses at the
entrance of Bubig Ray were very back
ward. With much disgust he found that
the guns which should have been mounted
â¢were delayed a month and a half. nn<l be
was no less disgusted to find that reli
ance was had for the defense of the port
â upon a few torpedoes not properly placed.
Finding Subig Bay aefenseless, the Span
ish squadron repaired .to the bay of
Manila to meet battle under less un
favorable conditions. The admiral avoid
ed the city, not wishing to draw fire upon
It and prepared his fleet for action, paint
ins bis vessels a dark gray and having ,
the fires spread and springs on the cables.

| He says that the force of Dewey'B yes
! sels, leaving out the transports, amounted
! to 21.410 tons. 49.290 horsepower, lt>3 gains
(muny rapid fire). 1T.'.0 men and an average
velocity of seventeen miles. Against this
the power of his only five effective ships
was 10.111 tons, 11,200 horsepower. 76 guns
: (very short of rapid tire), 1*75 crew and
! maximum speed twelve miles. The ad
miral describes in vivid language the ter
rible effect of the American onslaught on
the Spanish vessels. He says: "The
Americans fired most ranidly. There came
upon us numerous projectiles, as the three
cruisers at the end of the line devoted
themselves almost entirely to fight the
Cristina, my flagship.. A short time after ;
i the action commenced one shell exploded
in the forecastle and put out of action
all those who served the rapid-fire can
nons.
Meantime another shell exploded in the
foretop, Betting lire to the crew bags. ;
: At 7::w o'clock a shell destroyed completely i
! the steering gear. Another destroyed the i
mizzen. bringing down my flag and en
sign; another slu-ll exploded on the poop ;
' and put out of action nine men. A fresh
i shell exploded in the officers' cabin, coy
] ering me hospital with blood and de- ;
| stroying the wounded who were being '
I treated there. Another exploded in the j
I ammunition room.
"1 had to flood the magazine when v the .
! cartridges began to explode.
"One large shell penetrated the fireroom. j
i putting out of action one master gunner
j and twelve men serving the guns. An- ;
! other rendered useless tue starhoard bow
! gun, and while the fire increased astern
another fire started forward from another
shell. The broadside guns continued fir- j
'. ing until there were only one gun and
one seaman remaining unhurt for serv
ing.
! "The shin being out of control, the hull,
smokepiptf and the mast riddled with
shot, men confused with the cries of the
i wounded, half of the crew out of action, |
among whom were seven officers. 1 gate
the order to sink and abandon the ship |
before the magazines should explode."
| The story of the loss of the Cristina was |
j substantially the story of tne loss of all i
', the other Spanish ships, and Admiral !
Montejo sums up his account with this
statement:
"The inefficiency of the vessels which
composed my little squadron, the lack of
all classes of the personnel, especially
master gunners and seamen gunners; the
i inaptitude of some of the provisional ma
chinists, the scarcity of rapid tire ran- '
' non, the strong crews of the enemy and ;
; the unperfected character of the greater
! part of our vessels, all contributed to
: make much more decided the sacrifices
which we made for our country and to
prevent the possibility of the horrors of
j a bombardment of the city of Manila,
with the conviction that with the scarcity
'. of our force against the superior enemy
we were going to certain death and could
, expect a loss of all our ships. Our cas
; ualtles. including those of the arsenal,
amounted to 3SI men killed and
wounded."
Apparently the first suggestion of the
organization of the flying squadron,
which was to divert Admiral Camera's
squadron from his voyage to Manila,
came from Dewey, for tn a dispatch of
June 27 he says: "In my judgment, if
the coast of Spain was threatened the J
1 squadron of the enemy will have to re- I
\ turn."
And that was exactly what hap
pened. A month later the admiral pays
a high compliment to the British Con
sul at Manila. Mr. Rawson Waller, who
for three months had been discharging
the duties of United States Consul in
Manila and rendered great assistance.
The admiral's estimate of the impor
tance of the Philippines is set out in ;
the following telegram sent in answer ;
to an inquiry on the subject from the I
Government;
MANILA, Aug. 20. ]RfÂ»R.â Secretary Navy.
Washington: Referring to the depart
ment's telegram of August 13, important

THE SAN FRAN CISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 22, 1898.
MILES BLAMES THE
WAR DEPARTMENT
Speaks Bitterly of the Wretched
Treatment Accorded the
Armies in the Field.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 21. â General
Nelson A. Miles, commanding the
United States army, and General Wes
ley Merritt, commander of the Amer
ican forces at the capture of Manila,
were the principal figures before the
War Investigating Commission to-day.
General Miles responded to the sum
mons of the commission only after
days of consideration. His exami
nation was comparatively brief and not
sensational. He spoke with some bit
! terness as to the "embalmed beef" and
the canned beef supplied the army in
the field. This he characterized as an
experiment for which "some one in
Washington" was responsible. He said
j that the landing facilities of the Santi
j ago expedition were inadequate, and
that the men were short of rations and
medicines and might have been better
protected from exposure to fever con-
I tagion.
General Merritt told the commission
tfoat he regarded the Philippine expe
dition as a decided success and would
conduct it on the same lines if he had
it to do over. He spoke in high terms
of the troops under him and said his
army was well supplied with medicines
and food.
"Are you willing to be sworn?" Gen
eral Miies was asKed.
"I think," was the reply, "that I can
say wnat I have to say without being
sworn."
General Miles was fortified with a
large package of papers and had his
own stenographer. He gave his evi
dence in a clear, unhesitating way and
went into details regarding both the
Santiago and Porto mean expeditions.
He o-pened by describing the railroad
confusion in getting the war munitions
to Tampa, pointed out the lack of Gov
ernment storehouse facilities there and
said that the cars at one time were held
back as lar as Columbia, S. C. He
said that when the troops were loaded
it was found impossible tv- put more
than 16,000 men aooard, and they were
equipped as well as possible unaer the
circumstances.
"It was most fortunate," he said,
"that the transports had good weather.
If they had encountered a severe storm
the loss of life or the suffering, at least,
must have been fearful. As it was,
with fair weather, the men below,
crowded in with the mules and sup
plies, could get <,-n deck, which would
nave been impossible otherwise."
The commissary stores taken, he said,
were .sufficient, but the medical supplies
were inadequate. He had left the load
ing, except for general directions, to
the commander, General Shafter. He !
found, just before sailing, that there j
were a number of pontoon boats being
taken which would be utterly useless,
and he himself had secured two barges
from the owners there and had taken
other steps, but the supply of such
boats was very inadequate.
"The expedition," he continued. !
"should have been furnished with
launches, naphtha or steam, or tugs.
for towing barges from the ships to the
shore. We relied largely on the en- I
gineer officers and the engineer de- j
partment for these. In the second ex- i
pedition to Porto Rico these were fur- j
nished, but they arrived too late to ren- j
der assistance."
He said that before the first fleet
sailed from Tampa estimates had been
definitely made of the number of boats
to he furnished the transports and the
number to be furnished by the navy to
assist. The most cordial assistance, he
added, had been promised on the part
of the navy.
At Santiago the supply of tentage
and food was very limited.
"Were the medical supplies at that
time sufficient for the needs of the com
mand?" was asked.
In reply he road a dispatch from
General Shafter, sent fin August 4.
which referred to a chronic scarcity <>f
medicines, and stated that four men
had just died from the lack there
of. There Â»was at no time, said Gen
eral Mill-?, sufficient medicine foi* the
troops. He remembered seeing one
train for the sick in a drenching rain
with no covering over the wagons.
General Beaverâ From what you
learned and observed while there, do you
think there was at any time a sufficient
medical supply?
General Milesâ Of medical men and ma
terials?
General Beaverâ Yes.
General Milesâ No, sir.
The witness stated that the hos
pital accommodations were only of a
temporary character. He said that the
shelter was bad. The shelter tents did
not shelter. Questioned as to the char
acter of the facilities for transporting
the wounded, ho said that they were
taken in wagons.
General Beaver â Do you know if any
of the wounded were lying exposed to
the weather?
(Jf-neral Mil^s â Some wero exposed in
beinp sent down to the hospitals. I
saw one train of wounded men driving
along in the dron<-"hing rain with noth
ing to shelter them. H^ had taken
measures personally to correct matters,
and on July 12 had telegraphed for a
well equipped corps of pier and bridge
soldiers, etc., and had ordered certain
places burned.
General Miles said the transportation
facilities were used to carry supplies
to some 15,000 to 20.000 refugees from
Pnntiago and to about 5000 Cuban
troops. *
"This was not expected," he an
swered, in reply to a question, "because
I had cautioned General Shafter to
keep his men out of the Spanish build
ings of every character, and to keep
the men away from the natives. Had
he not done as he did the army would
have been much better supplied."
His army in Porto Rico, he said, had
been supplied, in a way, with quarter
master and commissary stores, but not
in the best way. At Porto Rico he had
asked that fixed rations be sent, but
instead they were s^nt down in bulk
without invoices nr bills of lading, and.
In many instances, stores were spoiled
in the hold and thrown away. This
caused great embarrassment and loss
of stores and deprived the troops of
food.
General Miles said the scarcity of
food largely caused the distress of the
troops. He had advised against the
shipping of beef to Porto Rico, both be
cause there was abundance of it on the
Island as well as because of his belief
that it was defective. He character
ized the refrigerator beef, of which
there was 327 tons sent, as "embalmed
beef," and said the canned fresh beef,
of which 198,000 pounds had been
shipped there, was condemned by of
ficers whose commands used it.
"Who fixed that beef as an army ra
tion?"
"You'll have to ask some one here in
Washington. You had better ask the
Secretary of War or the commissary
general. It was sent as food. If they
had not taken that they would have
had to go hungry. If they had sent
paymasters down there, as I asked, we
could have bought food, but they did
not do that."
General Miles suggested that the food
was sent to his large army under pre
tense of an experiment.
General Miles called attention to the
fact that good, fresh beef could be
bought in -Porto Rico for 6 cents a
pound American money, and he sug
gested it might be interesting to com
pare the cost of the refrigerated beef,
together with the expense of transpor
tation. He said he did not know but
that the chemicals used in treating the
beef were responsible for the great
sickness in the American army. Re
ports which he had received concern
ing it were to the effect that the beef
had an odor like an embalmed dead
body.
Captain Howellâ Were these reports
ever brought to the attention of the com
missary department?
General Miles â Reports were frequently
sent in to the commissary general; but
he seemed to insist that the^eef be used.
Captain Howellâ Was the- matter ever
brought to the attention of the Secretary
of War?
General Milesâ l requested that no more ]
of it be sent. If a supply were issuing I
to the men in this country I would pro
hibit their use of it. 1 am having an in
vestigation of this matter. I thought you
gentlemen would get on to it.
He said he had never complained to \
the Secretary of War as to the condi- j
tion of the beef, but he had asked that
the supply be stopped.
General Miles stated the first plans
I for securing the transports for Cuba
I were net his. The question at the out-
I set was a naval problem and the dis
patch of troops, in his judgment, then
hinged on which fleet would destroy
the other. If the Spanish had destroyed >
the United States fleet the United j
: States would have been blocked for a |
number uf years.
"If we had had a force in Cuba, too, j
we would have lost it, as it wo-uld have
been impossible to get it back here," he
said.
He was opposed, also, to sending a
large force to places like Havana or
Matanzas because of the large per
centage of yellow fever deaths.
He said the destruction of Cervera's
fleet settled that problem. He wanted
to operate with a small force against
the Spanish forces by harassing them
during the sickly season, aiding the
Cubans and not endangering the lives
of his own force. He also at first fa
vored taking Porto Rico to prevent the
Spanish using that as a base of opera
tions.
General Miles gave details of the I
Pond Rican expedition and obstacles. ;
Concluding with his opinion of camp
sites he said the first he knew of the
selection of Camp Alger, Va., the most j
objectionable camp, in his mind, was!
when the regiments began reaching
there. As to Chickamauga he had rec
ommended mobilizing the regiments
left, but he never anticipated 25,000
men would be sent, and when he found
the camp overcrowded he had recom
mended distribution of the forces
among other localities.
General Wesley H. Merritt was the
first witness of the afternoon. He be
gan his testimony by a description of j
operations around Manila prior to its â 
capture. Owing to the smallness of his i
force, ho said, the army was compelled
to operate along the sea front, in co- !
operation with the navy. Had there !
been a larger American force on land I
the city could have been taken from
the high ground inland, but this was j
tactically impracticable without leav- j
ing rmr base at the mercy of both Span- j
iards and insurgents. The city's de- ;
fenses were good. The Spanish rebels j
had excellent arms and ammunition, i
The engagement lasted not over two j
hours. The army had both Spaniards i
and insurgents to contend with.
"The insurgents were very anxious to
take part in the attack," said General
Merritt. "but they were not notified
when the attack would be made, as I '
was sure the entrance of the Filipinos
into the city would mean unnecessary j
bloodshed and pome looting."
General Merritt said the American j
losses were not correctly stated in the j
press reports. They were about 120 of- |
fleers and men killed and wounded. No I
accurate account of the Spanish loss ,
was ever obtainable. The American
force, however, captured over 13.000
BtandÃ of modern arms, and the Span
ish U>ss was known to be severe.
There was some discussion of the |
committee over the relative merits of j
the Springfield and the modern small
caliber rifles. This drew from General 1
Merritt the statement that nersonally â 
ho should prefer the Springfield with
smokeless powder to the caliber of 30 or
the Mauser. As an instance of the
lack of stopping power of the small
bore rifle, he said one of the officers :

General Merritt said, in reply to ques
tions, that the volunteers were as ef
fective and as enthusiastic as could be
desired. He regarded them as very ex
cellent troops. The supplies were suf
ficient at all times, except as to ice and
milk for fever patients. As to medi
cal supplies and hospital conveniences.
General Merritt said he had heard no
complaints. On entering the city the
army took possession of all the good
houses it needed and turned them over
to the medical department. The sick
and wounded were thus well provided
for.
General Merritt paid quite as high a
tribute to the civilian staff officers as
did General Shatter the previous day,
saying:
"They were good officers, intelligent,
anxious to learn and to work."
ANNEXATION A BLOW
TO SUGAR INDUSTRY
American Producers Protest Against
the Acquisition of Tropi
cal Territory.
CHICAGO, Dec. 21.â A conference be
tween the officers of the American Sugar
Growers' Society and manufacturers of
beet sugar machinery and representatives
of the beet sugar factories now in opera
tion was held in the office of the Orange
Judd Farmer, in the Marquette building.
The question under consideration was the
effect of the proposed annexation of sugar
producing territory in the West Indies
and the Philippines upon the develop
ment of American sugar producing In
terests.
The sentiment was unanimous that the
acquisition of tropical sugar territory
would seriously affect the development
of the beet sugar industry unless some
arrangements were made which would
protect the domestic product against the
operation of free trade in sugar from the
new colonies. It was decided to make a
formal protest to Congress against the
sacrifice of the interests of American
farmers, labor and cap^al for the benefit
of tropical regions. A committee was
appointed to draw up a formal petition
to Congress protesting against the acqui
sition of territory.
BRINGS SUITS FOR THE

Sacramento Attorney Institutes Pro-

SACRAMENTO, Dec. 21.â Albert M.
Johnson, one of the best known lawyers
of Sacramento, has brought suit in the
Justice's Court against the law firm of
Shortnage, Beatty & Brittain of San
Francisco for the recovery nf $25.
On October 11 last Shortridge, Beatty
& Brittain had a case .-.i the Supreme
Court of this county. The firm was rep
resented by the second partner, William
A. Beatty. He desired a dismissal, and
the Judge said he would grant it, pro
vided Boatty would pay the costs,
amounting to $25. Beatty happened to
be "short" at the time, and Justice
waited, like Patience on the monument,
until Beatty went down to Albert M.
Johnson's office and borrowed the neces
sary coin. Mr. Johnson asserts that he
has made repeated demands for the re
turn of the loan, but they have been un
availing, and ho now proposes to enforce
collection througu the medium of the
courts.

HON. ETHAN HITCHCOCK.
The Present Embassador to Russia, Who Will Succeed
Bliss as Secretary of the Interior.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 21.â At to-day's Cabinet meeting Secretary Hay
R-as the only absentee. The President stated to those members who did not
accompany him on his trip that he had decided to appoint our present Em
bassador to .Russia, Hon. Ethan Hitchcock, Secretary of the Interior, to
mcceed Mr. Bliss, who retires from that office upon the qualification of Mr.
Hitchcock, which is expected to take
place some time In February next.
The members who were personally
acquainted with Mr. Hitchcock spoke
of him in the highest terms, and all
agreed that the selection was admir
able.
The President at the time of the
resignation of Secretary Bliss invited
Senator John C. Spooner to take the
seat in the Cabinet vacated by Mr.
Bliss. Senator Spooner, it is said,
took the matter under advisement for
two or three days, but after consider
ing it notified the President that he
felt obliged to decline it.
Secretary Bliss, in an interview to
day, said: "It has been understood
for some time that it would be my
wish to retire from public life on the
conclusion of the. war. Now that the
peace treaty has been signed my re
quest to be relieved will be granted,
but I shall await the arrival of my
successor before severing my connec
tion with the Interior Department. I
have been in most hearty accord with
the President in his policy through
the trying days in which he sought to avoid war and while as commander
In chief he was conducting the war that came notwithstanding his effort
to prevent it. I believe most thoroughly in the course he is now pursuing
for maintaining the honor of the country by securing tha just results of a
successful war. I shall leave my associates of the Cabinet and of the de
partment and my many friends in Washington with great regret, but pri
vate and personal reasons make my retirement a necessity."
The Senate later in the day confirmed the nomination of Mr. Hitchcock.
More than a year ago he was appointed Minister to Russia, and when the
rank of the position was raised to that of an Embassy he was reappointed.
Mr. Hitchcock was formerly a lawyer and business man of St. Louis,
and was for some time a plate-glass manufacturer.
Senator Proctor, who was in St. Petersburg during the paÃt summer,
says he is very popular in the Diplomatic Corps and among the acquain
tances he has made abroad. He is a close personal friend of the Presi
dent.

HAVANA, Dec. 21. â It now appears
that the raising of the stars and stripes
over Fort Atares yesterday by Major
Russell B. Harrison was a surprise to
both the United States and Spanish
Military Commissioners. The Ameri
can Commissioners had said that no
American flags should be raised until
January 1. Major Harrison did not
know this, and when told to occupy the
fort he promptly raised the flag.
Nevertheless, though it flies in fuil
sight of the harbor and city, the Span
ish have not complained and it has not
been ordered down.
Major General Ludlow, Military Gov
1 ernor of Havana, arrived from the
j United States to-day and has had a
long conference with General Greene.
The United States and Spanish Mili
tary Commissioners will meet on Fri
day.
Effigies of General Weyler hung this
afternoon in Cerro, the suburb, sur
rounded by jeering crowds, while small
processions marched and counter
marched along the streets, shouting
constantly. Business is virtually sus
pended in consequence of the rejoicings
over the evacuation. In some Instances
bands of Cubans have visited Spanish
shopkeepers and compelled them to
shout "Viva Cuba Libre" and to wave
Cuban flags.
Senora Farrez, the lady who enter
tained the Cuban generals, Sanguilly
and Lacret, and other Cuban officers at
a dance at her residence in Cerro last
evening, sent a message to the United
States Military Commissioners, sug
gesting that the Spanish soldiery might
invade Cerro and raid her home. Major
Harrison, though taking no account of
her fears, stationed two guards in front
of her residence.
This evening the Cuban generals,
Maya, Rodriguez, Menocal and Vidal
and Julio Sanguilly, with other Cuban
officers, are to be entertained at Jesus
del Monte, another Havana suburb.
Printed papers, insulting to th? Span
iards and threatening to kill them
after January 1, continue to -be circu
lated in various parts of the island.
The Alcalde of Santiago de Las Vegas
has seized large quantities of such
clandestine prints and burned them.
The Cuban patriotic committees are
planning for a five days' feast after
January 1, during which all business
is to be suspended.

POVERTY DRIVES
HER TO PRISON
Marchioness of Donegal
Enters a London
Workhouse.
LONDON, Dec. 21. â The Marchioness of Donegal will eat her
Christmas dinner in a London workhouse. 111, miserably clad and
apparently in destitution, she applied yesterday for admittance to
il..- Dreat Northern Hospital, from which place she was removed to
the Islington Workhouse infirmary. She explained that she was
homeless and not willing to communicate with her wealthy friends
or with her husband, who is suffering from pneumonia.
The story of the life of the Marchioness is painful. She left her
husband in 1873 and in 1889 instituted separation proceedings, to
which counter-charges of misconduct were made. Unsavory details
of their conjugal life were bandied about. The Marchioness failed to
obtain alimony and has since received assistance from her friends.
She was last heard of in May of the present year, when she broke
her leg in a hotel elevator and was taken to a hospital.
The Marquis has had a troubled financial career. He was de
clared a bankrupt in 1889, with liabilities estimated at Â£519,000. He
then said he considered he was justified in raising a half-million of
money, in view of the fact that he had prospects of succeeding to an
estate and Â£500,000 a year. But owing to the entail he only succeeded
to Â£ISO a year. He was mixed up in financial floatation this year,
when he lent his name to a company prospectus which caused the
Star to criticize his as "a peer with a record of disgracing the order
to which he belonged."

This Means That the Islands Will Be

Limits.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 21.â The Senate '
Committee on Foreign Relations to-day
concluded its revision of the bills pro- ,
viding a territorial government for Ha
waii, and Senator Cullom reported the \
changes to the Senate. There were j
numerous changes, the most important i
I being as follows:
The section defining citizenship was
! amended by striking out the word i
"white" and also the explicit reference ;
to Portuguese, and left to read as fol- |
lows:
That all persons who were citiaens of
the r<*piiblic of Hawaii on August 21, IS9B,
are hereby declared to be citizens of the
United States.
The request of one-fifth of the mem- j
bers of the territorial House of Repre- j
sentatives is made sufficient to demand j
the ayes and noes, the original require
ment being one-third.
The provision in regard to the quali
i fications of territorial Senators is |
i changed so as to require that the Sena- j
! tor shall be a male citizen, 30 years of
age; that he shall have resided in the
Hawaiian Islands not less than three !
years, and that he "shall be qualified j
to vote for Senators."
The explicit property qualification is
stricken out. A like change is made j
in the provision regarding the mem
bers of the House, who are required to
be qualified by the changes to vote for
Representatives.

was also the provision requiring that

ing the territorial Supreme Court to
pass upon the qualifications of mem
bers of the Legislature was left as
recommended by the commission.
The Governor is required to send his
estimates for appropriations to the
Legislature as the whole and not to the
Senate alone, as originally required.
The following restriction on the issu
ance of bonds is inserted:
Nor shall any bonds or other instrument

yean from the date of issue thereof.
The provision that no retroactive law

WILL RATIFY THE
TREATY OF PEACE
This Action by Congress
Assured.
BRYAN ADVISES DEMOCRATS
URGES THAT THEY SUPPORT
THE MEASURE.
Question of Our Disposition of the
the Philippines and Cuba
Will Be Settled
Afterward.
Special Dippatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Dec. 21.â Clark Howell,
a member of the Democratic National
Committee from Georgia and editor of
the Atlanta Constitution, after consult
ing the leaders of both political parties
at Washington, telegraphed as follows
to his paper to-night:
With the adjournment of Congress for
the holidays the final decision of the
peace treaty is as clear as it will be after
a vote has been taken in the Senate, iwo
weeks ago the matter was in doubt; to
day it is as' certain that the treaty will
be ratified as it will be that it has been
after the vote has been taken.
Bryan has been in Washington for sev
ered days and has conferred frequently
and freely with the Democratic leaders
in both the Senate and the House. He
has advised ratification of the treaty, and
he is outspoken in the opinion that aside
from the Question of national obligation
it is a matter of party policy for the Dem
ocratic party to throw no obstacles in the
way.
There are members in both houses who
less than a week ago were in doubt about
ratifying the treaty; more than that,
some of them were outspoken in the opin
ion that it was, perhaps, better to reject
it. To-day many of these Democratic
leaders take the open position that thu
treaty should be ratified, and that it will
be no one who has studied the situation
from the inside can have any reasonable
doubt.
It must not\e understood that the rati
fication of the treaty will carry with it
the assumption that all those who vote
affirmatively are in favor of national ex
pansion across the Pacific. Of the Sena
tors who will vote in favor of the treaty
there will be Republicans as well as
Democrats who are opposed in principle
as well as in theory to the trans-oceanic
expansion of our national domain. They
take, however, and very properly, the
view that the question of expansion per
se is not involved in the consideration of
the peace treaty, and that after the
treaty has been" ratified with Spain and
has been eliminated as a factor in the
Philippine problem, it will be time enough
to consider the policy to be pursued in
dealing with the Philipnines, and just
here will come the real contest of the
qut'stion of expansion.
Mr. Howell then says that after the
treaty shall have been finally disposed
of a resolution will be introduced mak
ing a declaration of the proposed policy
of this Government in dealing with the
Philippines, and that this resolution
will be framed very much on the basis
of the Cuban resolution adopted coin
cident with the declaration of war, in
which it was declared that the policy
of this Government would be to give
the people of Cuba a free and independ
ent government of their own. Mr.
Howell further says:
The vote on this proposed resolution will
not be confined by any means to part
lines, and the outcome is in doubt. A
larp<- majority of the Democrats will vote
in favor of it, and a large majority of
the Republicans will vote against it, but
I the size df each minority is sufficiently
I involved in doubt as to render exceedingly
questionable the final action that will be
taken,on the resolution.
GREAT NORTHERN

LOS ANGELES, Dec. 21.â The Herald
to-morrow will say: Positive assurance

9{ INDUSTRIES ] A UAfcLIEUT. HOBSON ON
PATRIOTIC KISSING
Hero of Many Oscillatory Ex
ploits Utters a Defiance to
His Critics.
NEW YORK, Dec. 21.â A Denver special to the Herald says:
I-ieutenant Hohson paid tr>-day in regard to the criticisms that have
been passed upon his kissing exploits:
"My critics, I fear, are not patriotic. I have kissed a large num
ber of women, mostly young school girls, who have thus expressed
their patriotism. It was simply a matter of enthusiasm that found
vent that way. It was not a tribute to Hobson, the man, but to
Hnhsnn, the navy's representative. Any manâ any young man, at
leastâ in my position, would have done just as I have done. The
women and girls are not at all to blame in the premises. If there is
criticism to be made the responsibility is entirely mine and I'm per
fectly willing to assume it.
"The recent scenes may not appear well in the cold light of press
statements, but in a patriotic throng there is always an intensity
of feeling, among the women especially, and their patriotism found
expression in this manner, which is entirely agreeable to me. I
have nothing to apologize for and yet 1 regret deeply the bitterness
of tho criticisms that have been Dassed on my actions.'"
Lieutenant Hobson was the guest of the city of Denver to-day.
He arrived from Kansas City at 4 o'clock this morning, but remained
in his sk-tper until 8 o'clock, when he was met by a committee of
the Sons of the Revolution and escorted to the Brown Palace Hotel,
whore breakfast was served. He was heartily cheered by hundreds
of people who had assembled at the hotel to give him a welcome.
At 3 o'clock a reception was Riven in the rotunda of the Bron-n
Palace Hotel, attended by not less than 2000 people. There was no
kissing. The cop aittee having the affair in charge had decided that
this feature of Lieutenant Hohson's receptions in the East should oe
omitted hero, and the gallant officer heartily seconded the decision.
Arrangements were made to prevent the success of any attempts by
enthusiastic damsels, but they were unnecessary. Though more
than a thousand women were present to greet Hobson, not one of
fered to kiss him.
At 5 o'clock he delivered his lecture at the Tabor Opera House
and at 6:45 boarded the Union Pacific train for San Francisco.

was transacted.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CLEVELAND, Dec. 21. â Develop
ments of a sensational nature in the
I Standard Oil investigation came to
i light to-day when Attorney General
Munnett began taking depositions for
i the purpose of pro-ving that the Stand
, ard Oil Company, Just previous to the
j issue of the Supreme Court writ order
ing that the books of the company be
: produced in court, had destroyed a large
number of them.
The taking of depositions to prove
; Attorney General Monnett's allegations
was commenced before Harry O. Mason
to-day. The most important witness
: produced was John Darmstetter, rabbi
of a Bohemian church. Rabbi Darm
stetter testified that one evening three
; or four weeks ago he went into the
â  saloon of E. H. Pollock to see Pollock,
; who is an official of his church. He
j said that at the time Pollock was wait-
Ing upon several Bohemian laborers,
; who- were employes of the Standard Oil
Company, and he sat down until the
: saloon-keeper got through with his cus
tomers. Rabbi Darmstetter said that
[ one of the men in the saloon was quite
hilarious and was asked:
"Why are you fellows doing so much
treating?"
Two of the men then engaged in a
conversation, and, "flashing" a roll of
bills, said that they had got some good
stuff working overtime. One of them,
who was a teamster, said that he and
another teamster had loaded up a lot
of books at the Euclid-avenue office of
the Standard Oil Company and taken
them to the company's furnaces, where
they were burned.
Attorney General Monnett secured
I the residence and name of one of the
drivers, and when a constable went to
! subpena him to-day the man declared:
! '"My job is gone if I have to testify."
Another teamster of the Standard Oil
! Company, when informed that he would
i probably be called upon to testify, is
; reported to have said:
"They can't catch me. What we took
! were boxes, and I can't tell what they
I contained."
Edward O'Hearn, a teamster in the
employ of the Standard Oil Company,
| was found and placed on the witness
'â  stand. He testified that on the Satur
day before Thanksgiving day he was
' ordered to go to the office of the com
' pany on Euclid avenue and carry some
I boxes from there to the company's
warehouse on Independence street. He
said he got the boxes and delivered
them as ordered. He did not know the
i names of the employes who turned the
; boxes over to him nor those in the
| warehouse. He declared he did not
: know what was in the boxes and denied
having made the declaration in a sa
loon that they contained books.

Destruction of a Large Apart

Chicago.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Dec. 21.â The Melrose
apartment building, the largest struc
ture of its kind on the south side of
the city, was almost completely de
stroyed by fire to-night, entailing a
loss that will exceed 5100,000.
Scores of occupants of the building
were saved from injury by the heroism
of Paul L. Fischer, the elevator boy
employed in the structure. Through
choking clouds of smoke and almost
unendurable heat, the boy made ten
trips with his car and carried those on
the upper Moons to places of safety.
Then, exhausted from his efforts, he
struggled out of the building and was
taken care of by those he had rescued.
"The first intimation of the fire,"
said E. M. Roberts, one of the tenants,
"was the smell of smoke. I ran to the
fourth floor with Mr. Wells and found
a fire in the sitting room of a vacant
flat. Straw and wood were burning.
Mr. Wells and myself put out the
flames, after which we returned to our
flat. On our way up we found flames
on the fifth floor, whore some wood
and hay were burned* in a vacant flat
on that floor. This was put out and
when we returned to our flat the flames
had reached it. I will report my ex
perience to the police to-morrow."
Dr. E. M. Rosecranz, the owner of the
building, mortgaged it some time ago
to the Northwestern Life Insurance
Company.
DUEL WITH REVOLVERS
ON A CROWDED STREET
Fatal Combat Near the Northwestern
- Railway Depot in
Chicago.
CHICAGO, Dec. 21.â 1n the midst of the
crowds of pedestrians on Kenzie street,
close to the passenger depot of the North
western Railroad, to-night two men en
gaged in a duel with revolvers. One of
them was killed and the other probably
owes his life to the fact that his antag
onist's weapon contained an empty cart
ridge. Dennis E. Riley, a detective em
ployed by the Chicago and Northwestern
Railroad, was the victim of the encounter,
and his slayer Is Joseph A. Mayor of
Pleasant Plain, WlB.
The men had at one time been friends,
but lately had become estranged. An old
quarrel was renewed when they met on
the street to-night, and finally Riley drew
a revolver. Mayer then drew his weapon,
and the two men stood facing one another
with leveled revolvers. Crowds of people
scattered in alarm as they saw the flash
of the weapons, and Mayer and Riley had
full possession of the sidewalk.
The pause between the two men was
brief. Almost simultaneously they began
working the triggers of their revolvers.
Riley's weapon failed to act. but Mayer's
was discharged, and the bullet struck
his adversary above the heart. Mayor
then fired a second time and wounded
Riley over the left eye. The detective
dropped to>the sidewalk, while Mayer ad
vanced and r.tood over his body. He was
taken into custody without trouble.
We received seven cases of small panel
pictures last Monday night to retail

this sudden and radical rhango in the

AGAIN GRIP
IS EPIDEMIC
Now Marching Down
the Ohio.
CASES BY THE THOUSAND
DISEASE IN MILDER FORM THIS
WINTER.
Still It Is So SÂ«rious That Public
Institutions in the Larger
Cities Suffer Very
Severely.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
LOUISVILLE, Ky., Dec. 21.â 1t was
estimated by the health department to
day that there are 10,000 cases of grip
In this city. The ravages of the disease
have been so widespread that in many
cases business has been seriously im
peded. The public schools especially
have suffered, many of the teachers
having, been obliged to abandon their
duties owing to sickness. The state of
the weather which had been wet and
foggy for ten days past, is given as the
cause of the spread of the malady by
physicians. Grip this year has not
been so fatal, however, as it was dur
ing the famous epidemic of seven years
ago.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, Dec. 21.â An epi
demic of grip has struck Columbus
and it is estimated that there are sev
eral thousand cases. Local physicians
i all report the malady prevalent in
their practice though not in as serious
form as the epidemic of 1891. Public
institutions are severely afflicted.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Dec. 21.â There are
two dozen cases of grip in the City
Hospital and about 100 cases in East
St. Louis. The number of reported
suspects is daily increasing. So general
have the cases become that the phy
sicians of the city agree that an epi
demic of grip Is at hand. No deaths
have been reported so far and the dis- |
ease exists in a comparatively milo. I
form.
CINCINNATI, Ohio, Dec. 21.â The
grip, which seems to be prevalent in
some Ohio cities north of here, has
made its appearance in Cincinnati in a ',
very mild form and to a comparatively >
limited extent. Adults are rarely at- j
tacked. The disease shows a preference j
for male children. It is not attended i
by the usual sore throat and the fever
is so slight as to be barely noticeable.
It succumbs readily to simple treat
ment.
HALL CAINE'S OPINION
OF THIS COUNTRY 1
Impressions Formed During the
Novelist's Visit to the
United States.
LONDON, Dec. 21.â Hall Calnc, the
novelist and playwright, who returned
from the United States by the White
Star steamer Majestic, which reached
Liverpool on Tuesday, interviews himself
this morning In the Dally Telegraph to
the extent of four columns, giving hiÂ»
personal Impressions of America.
Of American Journalism Mr. Caina
speaks highly, though he is "surprised
at the small and fleeting impression the
war has made on the minds and condi
tions of American people." He thinks
there is "no great life fn the controversy
on the expansion questions." He doubts
whether anybody "feels Keenly either
way."
Referring to the relations between
Great Britain and the United States he
says:
"I believe the feeling in America toward
England Is the same as it was three years
ago. There has not been such extraor
dinary change as is to be observed in
England. The feeling for Enelana is
deep and widespread, cut the English
traveler in America is made to feel that
we in En-land are much more enthusias
tic on the union of the Anglo-Saxon race
than our compatriots in America are yet
prepared to be."
Mr. Came discusses pleasantly and ad
miringly most of the American Institu
tions.
SENT TO AN ASYLUM.
NEW YORK, Dec. 21.â The Press to
: morrow will say: Victory Bateman. the
: actress, last night was placed in the in
sane pavilion of Bellevue Hospital by her
: mother, Mrs. John T. Burke. The young
. woman had been showing signs of a men
; tal breakdown for several days, and was
f 1 radually approaching the stage of mania,
ier symptoms were like those she ex
hibited in October last in Newark, and in
; November, when she was playing Roxana
in "Cyrano de Bergerac," in Chicago.
Mrs. Burke saw that the inevitable was
, coming, and last night took her away in
a carriage to the hospital, where she was
i put under observation.

are many reasons why a wise woman fol-
lows this course. The chances are that an
obscure physician of small practice will
not diagnose troubles of this nature prop-
erly. If he does, he will insist on the
obnoxious examinations and local treat-
ment from which every sensitive, modest
woman shrinks.
The specialist referred to is Dr. R. V.
Pierce, for thirty years chief consulting
physician to the invalids' Hotel and Surgi-
cal Institute, at Buffalo, N. Y. Thirty years
ago he discovered a wonderful medicine
for diseases peculiar to women, that may be
used effectively in the privacy of the home,
and does away with all necessity for exam-
inations and local treatment. This medi-
cine is known as Dr. Pierces Favorite Pre-
scription. It acts directly on the delicate
and important -organs concerned in wife-
hood and motherhood. It makes them
6trong, healthy and vigorous. It allays in-
v flammation, heals ulceration, soothes pain
and tones and builds up the nerves. Taken
during the period of prospective maternity,
it banishes the usual discomforts and
makes baby's coming easy and almost pain-
less. â  It insures the little new-comer's
health and an ample supply of nourish-
ment. - Over ninety thousand women have
testified to its marvelous merits. Medicine
dealers sell it.
It is a druggist's business to give you, not
to tell you, what you want. :
Any ailing woman may write to Dr. R. V.
Pierce, Buffalo, N. V., and get free advice.

COUNSEL FOR MR. BALDWIN.
IF E. J. Baldwin, owner of the lot at the corner of j
Powell and Market streets recently covered by the j
Baldwin Hotel and theater, has been correctly re
ported in the newspapers, measures ought to be
taken to change the current of his thoughts and
bring him back to a realizing sense of his duty to
posterity and the public. Doubtless Mr. Baldwin has j
been subjected to a great deal of unkind criticism
since the Baldwin fire. Instead of sympathy having 1
been extended to him, abuse and detraction of various
kinds have been heaped upon him. This is contrary
to the usual custom in civilized communities, and we
do not blame him for feeling some resentment in j
consequence.
But his determination to erect a lot of shanties
upon the hotel site, and open a choice collevtion of
dives in the cellar, for the purpose of getting even on
the people, is certainly short-sighted and con- 1
temptible. With such improvements he might, per
haps, as he says, make his interest and taxes, but the
corner established in consequence would become a
cancer spot which would require elimination.
111 1 Mr. Baldwin yearns to get even on his detractors
he should hunt them up and engage them in vncal and
fistic gymnastic-. In that way he might obtain the
satisfaction he desires. To visit his spitefulness upon
the people of the city, however, substantially all of
whom are innocent of offending him, is uncivilized
and barbarous, and he may be sure that if he attempt
to do it they will unite and make him a great deal of
trouble.
What he should do with the Baldwin Hotel site is
to either erect upon it a new structure devoted to
commerce or sell it to some one who will do so. The
corner is trio valuable to be devoted to beer saloons,
cheapjohn clothing stores, cigar-stands, barber-shops
and dives.
If Mr. Baldwin care anything for the opinion of
posterity â he says he cares nothing for the opinion of
his contemporaries â he will proceed on business
lines in this matter without reference to the criticisms
of thoughtless people who have abused him without
cause. If he take any other course he will suffer
financially. Millionaires may bid defiance to their
individual detractors, but even they can be brought to
time by united public opinion and the indignation of
an entire community.
DISCIPLINE FOR A MONOPOLY.
WHILE the Gas Company acknowledges, when
cornered, that it has no right to exact a de
posit from customers, and while it will place
meters without exercising this imposition when the
customer knows his legal status and refuses to yield,
it nevertheless takes a deposit every time per
mitted to do so. It frightens the timid and cajoles the
uninitiated, the result being that its strong-box is
heavy with money derived from forced loans. On
these loans it pays no interest, but the handsome ag
gregate must bring to the corporation enough to
materially fatten its dividends.
As to the quality of light furnished, the accuracy of
measurement, the scant courtesy with which just
protests are met, there is no need here to treat. Per
haps with the prospect of competition these matters
will regulate themselves. However, there are means
by which the public can be in a measure protected
against the wrong it suffers by reason of the illegal
deposit. True, there is statutory remedy, but the law
is often slow, and an appeal to it costly. The specific
method of correction rests with the Legislature.
By the time the Legislature meets there should
have been prepared a bill defining the demand and
enforcement of a demand for a deposit a felony. This
would solve the whole problem. Such a bill could
not be defeated, because the justice of it would meet
with instant and general recognition. Too many out
rages have been committed in the nam* of the gas
monopoly, too many have felt the sting of its arro
gance, for it to be able to muster a sufficient oppo
sition. As an absolute tyrant, domineering over the
people from whom it draws sustenance, its reign
â¢fiould be about at an end.
Probably when General Shafter comes he will be
met by a broadside of abuse from the Examiner, and
t will comfort him to know that for days after he had
aimed the rag-tag of that journal out of Cuba his
picture, adorned with laurel, was above the entrance
(o the Examiner's office.
A murderer named Cheeseman has been taken from
the asylum where he had pretended to be a lunatic
and brought back to Oakland for trial. Probably he
is to be congratulated. Inmates of an asylum are not
permitted to be at large.
A Texan who stayed in jail twenty-two months on
a charge of contempt of court is out at last, but
probably were he to speak his real feelings he would
go back for life.
Since the war has been begun on consumption, and
the Prince of Wales has enlisted in the ranks, doubt
less the bacillus tuberculosis will take to the woods.
THE COALING STATION ARGUMENT.
IN commercial circles, and through them among the
people, the idea has been propagated that expan
sion by annexation and conquest is necessary to
get coaling stations. It has been argued that to ex
tend onr commerce we must have such stations. Yet
our foreign commerce has grown to immense pro
portions, and we have overtaken the trade of Great
Britain and passed it, with no coaling stations, and
without the disturbance of their acquisition or cost
of their maintenance and defense. 'Why load our
people and our trade with something that has proved
entirely unnecessary to our commerce?
England has coaling stations all around the world,
but they have not influenced her trade to a volume
superior to ours. When foreign trade has been talked
about, in times past, it has been customary to assign
her ownership of these stations as the cause of Eng
land's trade. But without them we have passed her,
and yet the idea remains and is made the most of to
fortify the argument for imperialism. In time of
peace every seaport is a coaling station. Trade grows
in peace, and not in war. If we own numerous
coaling stations and are involved in war each one
must be defended; each one is the United States, and
each will require the same force to protect it that
would adequately defend our entire continental pos
sessions.
If we have war, and it is brought nearer and made
more probable by each extension of our sovereignty
to distant islands, each colony and coaling station
must be defended by a fleet and an army. This means
for Porto Rico, the Ladrones. Hawaii and the Philip
pines, each, an army and a navy equal to the force re
quired for domestic defense. England has coaling
stations and must keep a thousand battleships to de
fend them, and yet her trade has not held its su
periority to our?.
The idea is fallacious that we increase our safety at
home by acquisitions abroad which must be defended.
It is an equal fallacy that we are to depend upon the
proposed colonies and coaling stations for an increase
in trade.
The statistics of British trade prove this. England
sends to her colonies a less percentage of their im
ports than they get from other countries, with the
single exception of British Guiana. The proportion
they take from her is:
The Straits Settlements 10 per cent
Mauritius 30 per cent
British Guiana 52 per cent
The Bermudas 30 per cent
British Honduras 40 per cent
British West Indies 41 per cent
New Pouth Wales 40 per cent
Queensland 40 per cent
Victoria 37 per cent
It is also a fallacy that colonies recoup the country
that owns them for the expense of their government
out of the public revenues of their total trade, or by
other taxes laid upon their people.
The cost to Englan 1 of the above colonies is an
nually 23,794,935 pounds sterling. Their revenues to
her treasury are 23,113,642 pounds sterling. There is
an annual outgo of $118,974,675 and $115,568,210 in
come, and a deficit of $3,406,465. Yet England has
the best managed colonial system that has ever ex
isted.
Already our navy is asking for $60,000,000 in the
next fiscal year to build battleships to patrol our coal
ing stations and colonies; and our army is asking
for 50,000 regulars for the Philippines and 25,000 each
for Cuba and Porto Rico. This is 100,000 soldiers,
and the pay of the privates alone will require $19,200,
000 per annum, their rations certainly as much more,
and their equipment and medical and hospital ser
vice as much more, making nearly $80,000,000 a year,
exclusive of the pay and commutations of the staff.
Bismarck said: "1 do not want any colonies at all.
Their only use is to provide sinecures. That is all
England at present gets out of her colonies, and
Spain, too. And as for us Germans, colonies would
be exactly like the silks and sables of the Polish
nobleman who had no shirt to wear under them."
It is easy to see that the building, manning and
operation of our new navy and the maintenance of a
standing army of ioo.ooo men, the support of Military
Governors, the transport service required in moving
such an army to distant stations by sea, and the trans
portation of rations and equipments, and the shipping
of coal to coaling stations, will bring our military
expenses, made necessary by this new policy, up to
$125,000,000 a year. We will not get this out of our
tropical colonies. It must come out of our home tax
payers, with the effect of doubling their public bur
dens. It will be spent on a fallacy, a chimera, a sen
timent of ignorant enthusiasm mistaken for pa
triotism.
Another disgusting feature is the probability that
voluntary enlistment will not give. us the men needed
to fill the ranks of an army to stand guard in the
tropics.
Captain Mahan, author of "Sea Power," is often
quoted by the imperialists, but he says, "Our race
cannot thrive in our new colonies."
Has any one heard of a returned private soldier
from the East or West Indian tropics who wants to
go back? We appear to have acquired coaling sta
tions and colonies the defense of which will require a
resort to conscription to secure the garrisons neces
sary to hold them.
McKINLEY IN THE SOUTH-
PRESIDENT McKIXLEY'S journey through
the South has been something like a grand
tour in celebration of a restored Union. It has
been marked at every stage by demonstrations of
Southern loyalty and Northern confidence. All
classes of Southern people have taken part in the
welcome. Old veterans of the Confederate army and
y >tir.g men born since the war ended. Bourbon Dem
ocrats of the deepest dye and negroes engaged in the
arduous task of advancing their race against Bourbon
prejudices, have all united and vied with one another
in doing honor to the chief magistrate of the nation.
These jubilant demonstrations were not caused
â wholly by the fact that Me Kinky is President of the
United States. Much of the cordiality of them was
due to the personality of the man. By his speeches,
so frank and sincere in word and tone, the hearts of
the Southern people were won even more than by the
august dignity of his high office. Other Presidents
nv-de tours through the South. Hayes, Cleveland and
Harrison visited that section, but none of them made
anything like the impression that McKinley has
made.
Undoubtedly one of the potent factors in the suc
cess of the President's conciliation was the manner in
which he had recognized Southern valor and loyalty
during the war with Spain. The appointment of
Southern generals to high command in the army
proved to the South that McKinley held no feeling of
animosity against the men who wore the gray, but, on
the contrary, regarded their military skill with admira
tion and had confidence in their patriotic love of the
Union.
A striking illustration of Southern sentiment on the
subject was given in a recent statement of Henry
Watterson. who in an interview at Washington said:
"I probably shall never vote again. The signing of
the commissions of those two ex-Confederate vet
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 22, 1898.
erans, Fighting Joe Wheeler and Fitzhugh Lee,
marked the certain dawn of that era for which I have
labored. I am satisfied now."
It was noted at the time that McKinley made more
speeches during the campaign of 1806 than were made
by any other candidate who was ever elected, and that
all of them were appropriate to the occasion and to
the audience â terse, pointed and animated by a lofty
sentiment. This felicity of speech, so marked during
the canvass, has been strikingly displayed in the
Southern tour. He has addressed Southern audiences
on the delicate subject of the Civil War in words that
won their rapturous applause, but without saying a
word that offended the most patriotic veteran of the
North. He has spoken to negroes of their advance
ment both in social and in political life in a way
that aroused them to enthusiasm, but without offend
ing the Southern whites.
When all things are taken into consideration the
tour is one of the most notable in history. It was a
genuine triumph won by a strong and winning per
sonality over old-time antagonisms of North against
South and white against black, and entitles McKinley
to a high rank among the great constructive states
men who have conciliated ancient foes and restored
to their country not only prosperity, but harmony and
patriotic love.
THE court favorite has always been a well-known
character in history. He had the ear of the
ruler, and generally used the position for his
own advantage. His influence was sought by those
who had private ends to gain. We also have our
modern favorites, but they bask under the sunshine
of the judicial instead of the ruling power. They
carry on their operations in the halls oi justice in
stead of the royal palace. They take an active part
in the nomination and election of some Judges, per
haps loan them money when in need, and look to
gather the nice plums which may be dispensed by the
judicial hand. Sometimes this favorite takes the
form of an official reporter, at others of a receiver
or a favored attorney. It is notorious that in some
cases the fees received by the reporter are greater
than those paid to the attorneys. The Judge may
order arguments to be written up which gives the
reporter an increased harvest. Lawyers are timid
and reluctant to complain against those practices, as
it might incur the displeasure of the court. The fa
vored attorney is often employed for his supposed in
fluence with a particular Judge, and is paid greater
fees than his associates who do the labor.
The receiver usually comes in for a handsome al
lowance in return for services which arc frequently
only nominal. A recent illustration of the easy way
in which a receiver and his attorney may earn money
is afforded by the Hale & Norcross case. A fund of
$300,000 was to be distributed under the judgment of
the court. A receiver was appointed to disburse this
money. Scarcely was the ink dry on his bond â
which, by the way, was given by a banker in whose
bank the money was deposited â when Judge Hebbard
made an order allowing $5000 to this receiver and
$5000 more for his attorney, which sums were
promptly drawn out. When all the parties interested
had agreed to the manner of distributing the residue
of this fund, the receiver and his attorney got another
whack at it, through the action of the same Judge, to
the extent of an additional $5000. Besides this, the
bank in which the money was deposited demanded
and received a compensation for keeping and dis
bursing it.
It is a fact, much to be regretted, that the general
public has, to a considerable extent, lost confidence
in our courts. Abuses in the administration of the
law have crept into some of them, and on this ac
count their general influence and standing have been
lowered. People hesitate for this reason to invoke their
aid. In many of our cities the business men have ar
ranged upon a method for the settlement of their
disputes out of court, by arbitration. This shows
that there is something wrong in the operation of our
judicial system, which should be speedily remedied.
No government is safe when there is a distrust of the
courts. The great bulwark of England is the confi
dence of her people that every subject has equal
rights before the law, and that the courts will admin
ister that law impartially. It is the duty of the press
of this land to uncover all abuses in the conduct of
the courts. The Call will not hesitate to do this
whenever the occasion arises. It also takes pleasure
in approving the manner in which' Judge Coffey
guards the interests of estates and prevepts their
spoliation. While some attorneys and legal repre
sentatives may carp at the scrutiny exercised by this
Judge in fixing their fees and regulating the general
expenses of administration, he is justly entitled to the
commendation of the community for the strict dis
charge of his official duties.
SINCE the truth concerning Dunning was first
dragged into the light his character has ap
peared so black that no redeeming traits have
been discerned. He has been guilty of the crime of
meanness, untrue to friends and family, unblushing
in the face of exposure. Without flinching, he has
portrayed himself.
There was a general conclusion that no good was
in Dunning, and yet at last he has created for him
self a gleam of sympathy. The human heart is kind
and quick to perceive good. It seems that in certain
of Dunning's orgies he had the companionship of
women who to the cause on trial bear no possible re
lation. Nevertheless, he was asked to reveal their
names. He refused to do so. It was proper and
manly that he should have refused. Uncomplain
ingly he went to jail for contempt rather than betray
and disgrace those to whom he was asked to be
a despicable traitor. It was the first outward indi
cation of decency in the composition of Dunning; and
the court ordered him to jail for it.
There is something anomalous in such a circum
stance. He can day after day detail his shameless
acts and go unscathed, save, perhaps, in a conscience
of which there is no visible token. An inclination to
be honorable seizes him, and a cell is the penalty.
The lawyer, perhaps, did well to withdraw the ques
tion. He would perhaps have done better never to
have propounded it.
A. H. Ingersoll of Oakland took an ax and with it
drove his wife and daughter out into the night and
the rain. Now and then something happens to revive
belief in the utility of the whipping-post.
Carnegie and Bryan will make a queer team, and
each will be too much surprised at finding himself in
harness with the other to get down to steady pulling
for a while.
Perhaps in the future some antique statesman will
be able to point with pride to the circumstance of
having been in McKinlcy's Cabinet from start to
finish.
It is a pity that some of the morbid and chronic at
tendants at the Botkin trial cannot be sent to the
garbage crematory.
COURT FAVORITES.
A FREAK OF JUSTICE.
RANCH AND RURAL LIFE.
That California can successfully stand a dry season was demonstrated
this year. Our export of green fruit is only 9 per cent short of that of
1597. It is true that a large acreage of orchard was fruitless, owing to lack
of rain and non-irrigable location, but it is also true that the Sierra foot
hill orchards and vineyards supplied 91 per cent of the usual export and
brought to the State as much money from that source as comes in an aver
age year. Not only this, but the trees and vines put out their usual growth
of new wood and will bear an equally large crop next year.
This experience goes somewhat farther than one derived from a diversi
fication of crops. It proves the existence of a safeguard to the State's pros
perity by diversification of location also. Formerly, before there was any
planting in the foothills, a drought implied general disaster, for it struck
down the live stock, wheat and fruit interests in the valleys and mining
in the mountains, and there was nothing to replace them. But now the foot
hill orchards and vineyards, which are planted up to an altitude of 3000
feet, have proved their capacity to sustain our commercial structure through
a dry year without fatal impairment.
The Spanish war has practically left the American market to California
raisins. It is not easy to find considerable lots of high class raisins in the
hands of the producer or even of the jobber.
This does not mean just one year of good prices and good demand.
Where even war, pestilence or famine has kept away from a market a pro
duct to which the consumers are accustomed, ' and it is replaced from a
new source of supply, that source can hold it in the future even against
the reappearance of the former product. The California raisin has many
points of superiority to the Spanish fruit. It is dried on trays and not on
the ground, and while the skin is thin and tender, at the same time it holds
better than the skin of the Spanish grape. The latter exudes the grape
Bugar, which crystallizes on the skin, and not being sufficiently saccharine
to resist decay, it rots and destroys the raisin. The California grape holds
all the sugar within the skin and therefore is a good keeper, a most de
sirable quality in any dried fruit.
Northern California oranges are a good crop this year and of fine qual
ity. Time was that the only orange tree known in the northern part of
the State was at Bidwells Bar, and it stood there a long time silently sug
gesting that where it flourished orchards of its kind would be profitable.
Now there is a large acreage in Butte and Yuba counties. Sutter and Co
lusa are also planting and the foothills of Placer County are every year in
creasing their export of excellent fruit.
STATE NOTES.
At Santa Ana the decortication of century plant fiber has been success
fully accomplished, producing a substitute for sisal grass in the manu
facture of cordage.
Biggs Notes says the cannery at Marysville this year expended $3C,000
for labor and $158,550 for fruit cans and fruit. A good showing for a dry
year.
Mr. Stone, at Thermalito, experimented with fertilizers on his olive
trees and reports a great increase in the crop and improvement in the
quality. More barnyard manure gof>s to waste in California tlian any
where else in the Union: where it might be used with greater benefit than
anywhere else.
The Gait Gazette editor planted an apple orchard, and along came the
borers and bored the trees, killing many of them and nearly killing more.
As a preventive he drove some rusty nails into the trees near the ground;
since then not a borer has attacked them. This is worth knowing, as
the orchardist has a hard headed enemy in the borer.
W. A. Rogers of Thermalito observed many barren trees In his orange
orchard. They bloomed profusely, but set no fruit. He used barnyard ma
nure plentifully around them and they became roliably fruitful.
The Cloverdale Reveille says that on the recent marriage there of Mr.
Martin and Miss Tarwater, the groom's mother presented the bride with 100
acres of fine land. That is a sensible dowry, much better than diamonds or
a check.
The Fountain Grove vineyard, Sonoma Count}', has just shipped two car
loads of wine to Japan.
The Cloverdale Citrus Fair Association is preparing to hold its fifth
annual exhibition. This annual fair has so promoted the planting of
orange orchards that Sonoma County will soon be in the field as an ex
porter of that fruit.
John Rapp of Colgrove, Los Angeles County, has experimented suc
cessfully in growing pineapples. He procured plants from Florida, and it
took them three years after planting to get acclimated. Then they bore a
satisfactory crop and produced acclimated suckers for replanting, which he
has distributed to favorable localities in Southern California. He says that
by setting out plants as early i:i the spring as possible the fruit will ripen
at a season when imported pines are out of the market.
Kelly Brothers, the grÂ«at bee ranchers of the Santa Ynez Mountains, re
port that dry weather has so affected the honey blooms on which they de
pend for the supply secured by their bees that there is not enough in thÂ«
hives to feed the bees through the winter, and they expect to feed them
twenty tons of extracted honey from their stock on hand. Hay and honey
are valuable where trie drought f-truck.
The Long Beach Press says that Mr. Norman, on the Alamitos tract
has introduced a new fruit from Africa called the roselle, which thrives
even in arid situations. It makes a delicious jelly and pickle, and in hot
weather makes an agreeable drink. Mr. Norman wishes to distribute the
seeds.
The Chino Champion estimates the highest output of beet sugar next
year in the history of that California industry. The factory at Santa Ma
ria will use 1000 tons of beets per day; the Hueneme 1000; the Spreekels at
Salinas, 3000; the Los Alamitos 700.
The raisin crop this year nets 3^4 cents a pound in the sweat box against
1% cents last year.
The walnut crop of Fullerton this year is eighty-four carloads.
New fruit canneries are projected at Newcastle, Santa Ana and Ven
tura. The Increased orchard area and output of fruit will require them.

AND
THE RING.
momentarily
causer] his heart to cease beating and that
made his patent protected smile look like
30 cents in a fop. Mr. Cummings has a
fondness for jewelry, and he Is the pos
sessor of a rare collection of gems. Lat
terly he has developed a penchant for
diamond rings, and to satisfy this crav
ing, and at the same time try his luck,
he has been investing In tickets, ranging
in price from 5 cents to $2, which he holds
as chances on a very fine and costly dia
mond ring which is to be raffled off. Mr.
Cummings has about fifty of these tickets
of the $2 kind, for he does nothing on a
cheap basis. He has made it a rule to in
vest In these tickets whenever the idea
occurred to him, and the idea has bobbed
up in his mind several times a day.
Last week two of his friends walked care
lessly up to the counter in the hotel, and
pretending not to notice Mr. Cummings,
who was studying the register, they began
to comment on the fact that it was a
shame that the person who had the ring
in his possession had skipped the town
with over $1000, the proceeds from tickets
sold, and the ring as well. Mr. Cum

the conversation. Immediately lost four
pounds in weight, had a nervous chill and
swore at a bell boy. Visions of flfty
tickets worth just fifty snaps of his deli

wits. Oh, no, on the contrary he began
to look out for number one with a great
degree of alacrity. Presently Mr. Cum

also desires to win the aforesaid ring. He
had his fifty tickets with him, and these
he quietly offered for sale at 5 cents on
the dollar. He explained his desire to dis
pose of the tickets by saying that he had
recently joined the church, and that he
did not believe in the lottery system;
that it was a wicked, pernicious habit,

SCHOOL CASH
IS GONE UNTIL
NEXT JANUARY
Treasurer Reis Calls
a Halt.
WILL PAY NO MORE BILLS
XO iIOXEY TO THE CREDIT OE
THE DEPARTMENT.
Funds Will Begin to Come In Next
Month, but He Refuses to An
ticipate Them â 5225.000
Borrowed Already.
No bills of any description against the
School Department will be paid during
the present administration. The board
may pass them to Its heart's content,
with c-r without the signature of Super
intendent Webster, and Auditor Broderick
may audit, but they. will fail of payment
when they finally come to the office of
the Treasurer. Treasurer Reis announced
yesterday that until he had the money
In hand he would honor no warrants, and
that there would be no money in hand un
til the middle of January at the very
earliest.
The School Department is Indebted to
the city treasury to the extent of $225.<>XJ,
*:Ss.<Â») borrowed from other funds and an
overdraft for JTO.tXM. Treasurer Reis has
already received {335,600 of the recent tax
collections figured on as the schools'
share, and to this amount $S2,CÂ»Â» addi
tional may soon be added. The first
amount has been already disposed of, and
the next moneys to come in, includine the
schools' share of the State tax. must be
turned over to the accounts from which
he has borrowed.
This does not mean that; the school fund
is depleted. There remains to its credit
Jas.vju. but this amount is at present only
on paper. The actual cash will not be on
hand until the Bui has sent to this city
its share of the collections and the bor
rowed funds have beer, restored.
Treasurer Reis said yesterday: "I sup
pose I could go on borrowing from other
funds until the SvS.OQ) still to the credit of
the School Department is exhausted, but
there is already an overdraft of ST),CÂ«Â»
and a debt due other funds of $ISS,CÂ»>J, and
I will not borrow any. more. I shall not
pay any more bills until the actual cash
is in the treasury. This will not be until
about the middle of next month, and the
duty will fall to my successor. The
School Department still has nearly JlCv,
(â¢Â» to its credit, or will have at the end of
this month."
Auditor Broderick has also taken a firm
> stand in the matter of School Department
bi'.is. Of the supply bills that have been
sent to him he has audited (10,000, but the
rest he has held up pending a settlement
of the present legal questions that have
been raised by the action taken by the
teachers. He is inclined to take the view
that teachers are not creditors, but offi
cials, and that their pay is a considera
tion that has precedence over the claims
of ordinary creditors.

has received but little private help.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORIC. Dec 21.â The market waa I
rtrong most of the day, particularly in the late |
trading. Fractional Rains were general In the I
railway?, while the advance In a number of i
bpecialties reached considerable proportions. A
curious exception to the general advance was j
noticed in stocks where dividends have Just j
been declared, namely, New York Central, j
Southern preferred and Atchlson preferred. In j
pome quarters large dividends had been ex
pected and in the case of Southern preferred
and Atchison preferred, a statement had been
looked forward to that they could be put on a
regular dividend basis instead of disbursements
from time to time as the earnings warranted.
A considerable increase in its quarterly sur
plus was responsible for New York Central's I
rise from the extreme low point. The efforts |
of London to cover short lines in Americans I
pave tone to the local market early. Most
stocks unaffected by special developments or
foreign quotations were freely offered by trad
ers, hut this caused little more than a period
of ..esltancy and a shading in railway quota
tions. Rumors that the Chicago and Alton :
had been secured in the interest of the Union i
Pacific and the Baltimore and Ohio resulted !
in a sharp rise in all the securities mentioned.
Federal Steel stocks were bought confidently
by the fame parties who have recently been i
large purchasers: at the same time they em- i
phatically denied rumors that Federal Steel
was about to absorb another large concern.
The Southwestern railways were very promi
nent in to-day's activity and strength.
The bond market showed irregularity In
â pots, profit taking being evident In Atchlson
adjustments. The general market, notwith
standing the Hesitancy of some Issues, dis
played a very â  healthful undertone. Total
tales, $5,040,000. United States old fours reg
istered advanced %c in the bid price.
The total sales of stocks to-day were 845 900

THE LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. Dec. 21.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablfrram says: The
markets here were dull this morning, but a
brisker business was done later in sympathy
with Americans, which opened good, and then
bounded upward, with Baltimore and Ohio and
Central Pacific leading. New York caused a
small setback afterward, but soon bought
Union Pacific, causing a resumption of the
rise. American sales began when the market
closed, causing a flat finish. There has been
big buying- here, with the Idea of laying in
stock for the new year. The new French loan
Is said to be practically arranged. Gold was
bid for et 78s by Germany. Money Is easing.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Dec. 21.â For two hours following
the opening In wheat the market was ex
tremely dull. The opening was weak and
lower. Liverpool showed , declines ranging
from % to %d and Paris also reported a de
cline. The weather In Argentine was report
ed to have greatly improved, while rains in.
Calfiornia continued, giving promise of a very
heavy crop. May opened %c lower at 66%
666%. The market held at about that price
for a short time, then slowly, but surely, de
veloped strength and ' activity. Corn was the
big factor. That market got into new high
ground and the sharp advance rather frighten
ed wheat Shorts, who came into the market In
gradually Increasing numbers. To strengthen
the bull situation Paris reported an advance in
wheat equal to l@l%c per bushel. The market
became very active after noon. Shorts
found considerable difficulty in covering any
thing but very small lots, and in the last hour
they bid prices up with a rapidity that was
refreshing to traders with wheat for sale.
Trade late In the session was very broad and
general. May advanced to 68% c shortly be- !
fore the close and that price was asked as the ;
bell sounded. I
Corn opened rather weak and slightly lower,
due to weak cables and the poor quality of
corn receipts, . but soon became strong and
during the latter part of the session was re
markably active and firm. Export demand was
again excellent. Shippers were large buyers
against sales of cash. This started shorts to
covering, . but corn was scarce until prices had
been bid up sharply. Leading bull Interests
also bought aggressively. â  May closed l%c
higher. i-r-7-'
Oats were rather slow, but strong. The ad
vance in corn was the main factor, causing
scattered covering by shorts all day. May
closed %c higher.
Provisions were decidedly dull, compared
with wheat and corn. The market was rather
wobbly at first, due to heavy foreign markets
and free selling by packers. The strength of
the grain markets later brought plenty of
buyers into the market and in the latter pa
of tne session the market was firm, prices ad
vancing a little. At the close May pork was
Be lower. May lard 2%@5c higher and ribs 5c
higher.

BOSTON WOOL MARKET.
BOSTON, Mass., Dec. Jl.â The American
Wool and Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow:
The Wool market has continued very active,
the volume of transactions reaching an aggre
gate of over 6.500,000 pounds. A few good-sized
lines have been taken by both local and out
side speculators who believe that the Wools
which they have purchased are cheap. Specu
lative operators have, however, been mostly
confined to Australian Wools In bond, which
are understood to have been moved at prices
not far from 20 cants. The tone of the market
is on the whole steadier.
The sales of the week in Boston amount to
4.435.000 pounds domestic and 2,187,000 pounds
foreign, making a total of 6,624,000. against a
total of 5.217.000 for the previous week and a
total of 5.5G3.000 for the corresponding week last
year. Sales since January 1, IS9B, amount to
137,337,500 pounds, against 351,662,100 pounds last
year at this time.

An Injunction Filed by
Reduction Works.
DEMANDS THEIR PATRONAGE
BUSINESS AT THE CREMATORY
IRREPARABLY INJURED.
The Re.'usal to Pay the Established
Price of Cremation Claimed
to Be a Violation
of Law.
The corporation organized under the
name 05 the San Francisco Reduction
Works cff San Francisco has filed suit be
heJQnited Stale Circuit Court, claim
ing that under tho stipulations inserted
in the franchise, which were virtually ac-
I by the Board of Supervisor! when
they granted the privilege of cremating
the garbage of the city for a period of
. it is unlawful for any individ
ual or rival corporation to dispose of gar
bage in any rther way or in any other
Ity than t. 1 . at provided by the reduc
ii<m works, ''he managers allege that
they h*ve tfesa injured Irreparably by
ihe individual 'ltalian scavengers of the
city and other, under the control of the
Call torn 'l Redaction Works (stated in the
complaint the California Reduction Works
a a result of these men
having : dippoF"d of garbage at other
dumping; grouijds free of tlie 25-cent toll
which the corrsoration claims as a lawful
right to receiw for every cubic yard of
form collected in this city.
They have F.cqulred, they claim, the
right "of disposing of refuse at the cre
matory in the southern portion of the
city, and any individual or corporation
that doe? not recognize their corporation (
as the only one la guilty of a misdemeanor
houid be punished for committing
lation of the municipal laws.
The complaint is one lor injunction and
processes have been served on the various
independent scavengers who are not ,ln
mploy of the San Francisco Reduc
tion Works. Proceedings to prohibit them
from disposing of garbage in any other
way than by turning it over to the cre
matory will he begun at once before the
< Jircuit Court. Pending the outcome of
the suit the injunction will be rigidly en
forced and those under its ban will have
-ist from the furtherance of their
iesa and traffic in garbage until a
final decision is handed down by the
court, either for or against them.
Those in the community who are now
r.izing independent industry will have
to allow their garbage to accumulate in
definitely or dispose of it by paying for
its cremation at the reduction works.
If the efforts of the San Francisco Re
duction Works meet with success the
Italian scavengers will have to adopt an
other profession, as It will be almost ut
terly impossible for them to continue in
their business and pay the extra 25 cents
a load for the cremation of their garbage.

TROUBLE OVER
THE SPOILING
OF A SILK HAT
A War Declared on
Street Awnings.
HIS DIGNITY WAS RUFFLLD
HOW A DOWNTOWN MERCHANT
EVENED SCORES.
Street Superintendent Ambrose Pro
ceeds to Carry Out the Order
of the Grand Jury to
Abate a Nuisance.
This is a composite tale of a ruined silk
hat, ruffled dignity, offending awnings,
three deputies from the Street Depart
ment and a bunch of wild-eyed mer
chants.
The firs*t formerly adorned the crown of
J. B. Stetson of the firm of Holbrook,
Merrill & Stetson, but has since been rele
gated to the Examiner's circulation bu
reau at the garbage crematory; the
second is embodied in the aforesaid J. B.
Stetson; the third are those profanity
breeding nuisances scattered all over
town- the fourth are known as William
Alman. John Bowen and William Max-
well; while the last are doing- business
along Market, Kearny, Post and Geary
streets. There are also some minor Issues,
which will develop later in the narration.
It all came about in this way: Mr. Stet
son is a stately gentleman of dignified
carriage, as becomes one of the solid citi
zens of this great metropolis. Therefore
it is only meet that his broadcloth and
immaculate linen should be topped with
a glistening silk tile. A most imposing
figure was that of Mr. Stetson as long as
he kept within his own bailiwickâ that is,
in the wholesale districtâ when he
invaded the retail precincts uptown it
was different, and all because of those
awnings that project over the sidewalks.
Now, awnings, properly adjusted, are of
vast benefit to pedestrians as well as a
means of protection to goods displayed
in store windows. But when they are
permitted to drop down over the sidewalk
like a nightshirt on a slack clothesline
they are neither useful nor ornamental.
Mr. Stetson has met these awnings be
fore, to his discomfiture and the mussing
of his hat, and there are several vows re
corded opposite his . name to the effect
that when he went uptown again he was
going to take to the roadway. The vows
might have held good had it not happened
that the gentleman had no occasion to
take to the bad lands again until last
Monday, which was somewhat Juicy. The
awnings were temptingly set, inviting him
under their sheltering folds, and in a
moment of weakness the vows were re
considered and Mr. Stetson-got out of the
wet.
Before he had gone a block his hat had
been brushed from his head by the awn
ings and was a sight, Mr. Stetson was
in a rage, and boarding a streetcar he
went out and told his troubles to the
Grand Jury.
Those inquisitors discovered that there
Is an ordinanceâ long since forgottenâre
quiring awnings, signs and similar ob
structions to be at least nine feet from
the sidewalks. Street Superintendent
Ambrose was sent for and notified to tear
down every awning at once that was be
low the regulation height. Mr. Ambrose
instructed Deputies Alman. Maxwell and
Bo wen to carry out the mandates of the
Grand Jury, and at 8 o'clock yesterday
morning they began work. They did not
tear down any offending canvases, but
they notified th.c tradespeople along
Kearny. Market, Post and Geary streets
that they -must raise their awnings at
once or they would be removed. Almost
every storekeeper on those streets was
found to be an offender, and they received
the ultimatum with various degrees of
fortitude. Some promised to remedy the
evil at once and proceeded to do so;
others declared their intention of taking
their time about it, while a few made
warm weather remarks about the Grand
Jury and everybody else. â â 
The deputies experienced the greatest
difficulty among the milliners and hair
dressers. Bowen was the first to deal
with the ladies. -He tackled a Kearny
street milliner, but did not remain-inside
long. He came out looking red in the
face and appeared to be apologizing to
a determined looking female. The awn
ing was not disturbed. After that he
shied whenever he saw a woman â¢in a
store. Maxwell, too, seemed to pass the
ladles by after a bout with a pair of
candy girls, so that duty fell upon Al
man. He got along all right until he went
against the proprietress of a hair dressing
establishment on Market street. The lady
was fixing up the show window when Al
man entered. . He politely informed her
that the awning in front of her store
would have to be raised to nine feet above
the sidewalk, and Instantly he was sorry
that he spoke.
"Oh, I know you," said the lady scorn
fully. "You're Sam Bainey in disguise,
but you can't do any politics here. That
awning is fifteen feet from the sidewalk,
and I shan't touch it; neither shall you."
As the lady was not . more than nine
feet out of the way in her statement Al
man said he was sorry for his mistake
and escaped.
One merchant on Geary street said San
Francisco was too "jay' a town for him
and declared his intention of moving; a
Market street bookseller threatened to
report the Grand Jury to Chief Lees If
any harm befell his awning, and a ladies'
furnishing goods dealer In the next block
openly defied the deputies. Alman opened
his pocket knife and wan about to cut the
awning down: when the merchant : weak
ened and promised to , have it raised â¢at
Superintendent Ambrose is determined
to abate these nuisances, and In a day or
two he will send the deputies out again
with positive instructions to tear down
any awning that : may be found below the
regulation distance from > the sidewalk.
No further notice will be served on the
storekeepers.
And i thus is J. B. Stetson's ruined tile
avenged. >^
THE SA3? FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 22, 1898.
POLITICIANS
PONDER OVER
LEGAL PUZZLE
Fine Point Raised Over
Edwards' Death.
WILL IT CREATE A VACANCY?
CHESEBROUGH'S FRIENDS SAY
IT WILL NOT.
On the Other Hand, Laws and a
Supreme Court Decision AxÂ©
Quoted to Show the
Contrary.
Out of the. death of John G. Edwards,
who was elected a member of the State
Board of Actualization, has grown a legal
problem that is puzzling and worrying
Governor Budd, Governor-elect Gage and
a host of politicians. The vital issue is:
Has the death of Edwards created such
a vacancy as the law contemplates shall
be filled by appointment by the Governor?
The friends of A. Chesebrough, whom
Edwards was elected to succeed, are
strenuous in the contention that no va
cancy will exist after the term for which
Chesebrough was originally elected.
They claim that the death of Edwards,
occurring before he had entered upon his
term of office, did not create a vacancy;
that, therefore, the Governor has no
power to appoint any one to succeed
Chresebrough, and that Chesebrough
must hold over until "his successor is
elected and qualified." This would mean
until after the next general election, four
years hence, or until after a special elec
tion called by the Governor.
These contentions are based largely on
the decision in the case of Melony vs.
Whitman, 10 Cal., 38, wherein it was held,
among other points, that "The failure on
the part of the Controller-elect to qualify
creates no vacancy in the office."
On the other hand, those who are inter
ested in having a new man appointed to
succeed Chesebrough quote from the
same decision to show that Chesebrough
cannot hold over, and that a vacancy
has been created by the death of Ed
wards before the latter qualified.
Section 9, article XIII, of the constitu
tion provides for the creation of the State
Board of Equalization and says their
"term of office shall be for four years."
It further provides that the Legislature
shall have power to provide for the elec
tion of said Board of Equalization.
Acting under this authority, the Legis
lature enacted section 352 of the Political
Code, which provides for such election
and reads in part as follows:
Their term' of office shall be four years,
commencing from the first Monday after the
first day of January following their election.
Section 99G, subdivision 9, declares that
an office becomes, vacant on a person's
"refusal or neglect to file his official oath
or bond within the time prescribed "
Section 999 declares that the Governor
must fill any office that becomes vacant,
and no mode is provided by law for Jill
ing such vacancy.
These are the provisions of the consti
tution and the statute laws bearing on
the matter. And it is on the strength of
these that the opponents of Chesebrough
claim there can be. no extension of his
term. They point out a vital flaw in nis
claim. It lies in the words prescribing
the term of office for members of the
Board of Equalization. This prescription
they say differs materially from that de
fining the term of office of the Controller.
In the case of members of the Board of
Equalization the term is for a fixed
period, without any qualifications. In the
case of the Controller it Is proivided by
section 17, article V, of the, constitution
that ! his term of office . shall be the same
as that of the Governor. - Section 2 of
the same article of the constitution pro
vides that the Governor shall hold nls
office for four years, "and until his suc
cessor is elected and qualified."
The distinction between a fixed term
and a qualified term 1 was clearly brought
out In the : Supreme ; Court decision al
ready referred to." After deciding that the
Incumbent Controller â  held from . the time
of his Installation in office, and until his
Buccesor had . qualified, it went on and
made this important and ' significant dic
tum: â /-â ."â  .â â --â â ' 'â  ' â¢â  ..;",. - â  â â¢- â â  â 
"The case is ; different with respect to
District and Supreme Judges. They hold
their offices from a day certain, and for a
fixed period, and not ; until their success
ors are qualified." "TtniyifH^wiTOi 1
; Those who are ; opposed to ; Chese
brough's â¢ continued Incumbency hold that
this dictum : applies most -. directly and
clearly ; to the present conditions sur
rounding the office which i Edwards was
elected to fill, and that - a vacancy will
exist on January 2.
In- Justice- to Chesebrough It can be
stated ; that he does not ; want ; the -office,
and even if he could hold it under tne
law would, so his friends say, resign. .Un
der no circumstances would he continue
to serve. _______________ . '

FIRST TENOR
CAPTURED THE
CROCKER STAKE
The Favorite, Sam Mc-
Keever, Unplaced.
LOS MEDANOS RAN SECOND
THE HURDLE EVENT A FARCI
CAL AFFAIR.
Jingle Jingle First at Odds of 10 to 1.
Lady Britannic at Home in
the Mudâ Three Favor
ites in Front.
It is now the season when two-year
olds are asked to stretch it out and eight
youngsters with the silk up answered thÂ«
"bugle call when the Crocker stak^ was
called at lngleslde yesterday. The dis
tance was one mile and Garnet Fergu
son's colt, Sam McKeever, closed post
favorite in the betting, backed down to
13 to 5. In the overnight books First
Tenor enjoyed the call, but it was cur
rently reported that the muddy going
was not to his fancy and 4 to 1 in pro
fusion was obtainable about him. The big
Falsetto colt disapproved of this theory.
Slow to begin work, when the field was
dispatched to a beautiful start Thorpe
took him on the outside, where there was
firm footing, and gradually passing one
after another of the starters, at the wire
beat Los Medanos three lengths. The lat
ter colt made all the running, taking the
place from Survivor by a couple of
lengths. The stake was worth $900 to the
winner.
The other events were very common
place, scarcely worthy of more than pass-
Ing comment. On three occasions favor
ites were seen in front at the wire.
The mile hurdle probably furnished more
real amusement than anything else. It
was so amusing as to be really funny. If
the riders hau been colored instead of
white it would have been ridiculous. As
it was it was rea.iy interesting. When a
good-natured, sport-loving public would
stand for the Sharkey-Fitzsimmons rob
bery without resorting to any riotous
demonstration it is only to be expected
that it will witness these hurdle race fias
cos without making any unnecessary
noise. On almost any other course in the
country bets would have been declared off
on such an extravaganza as that of yes
terday. Reddington, the Corrigan entry,
ridden by T. Murphy, the stable jockey for
Andy Blakeley, the grand Pooh Bah of
hurd'leism at the Corrigan track, was the
real live one. The other starters were all
dancing attendance on him and Redding
ton, almost left at the post, won by him
self at the end. Durward, a horse that
could not jump a straw bond, and 50 to 1
In the betting, beat the other heavily
played ones for the place. Can it be possi
ble that the spirit of Little Pete, the yel
low Napoleon of the turf, still hovers
around our tracks?
Jingle Jingle, a 10 to 1 shot, surprised
the crowd by taking the opening event at
five furlongs from a fair field. Silver
Beau, the favorite, was beaten a head at
the wire by the outsider.
The black mare Lady Britannic, right
at home in the muddy footing, led from
the start in the six furlong sprint next
decided. Hard ridden at the end, she led
Prince Tyrant out a head. Robert Bon
ner, a 100 to 1 shot, was third.
Sokombeo was made favorite for the
maiden event at six furlongs, and ran as
if the lobster salad partaken of the night
before had given him indigestion. He was
unplaced. Credo, the Corrigan entry, sec
ond choice in the betting, won easily from
Henry C, a 15 to 1 shot, ridden by Spen
cer.
Plunger McManus 1 fast horse, Lord Mar
mion, opened favorite for the final six
furlong spin, but went back in the bet
ting. The smart coin went in on Mid
light, and the brown mare turned the
trick, winning, ridden out by a length.
Cyril was given the place over Ricardo.
Track Notes.
Eddie Jones, who rode Highland Ball,
â¢was suspended for thirty days for not
persevering more with his mount at the
finish. The chestnut horse was bumped
and badly jostled at the start, and at the
wire was nipped out a head for the show
by Robert Bonner. Jones has been doing
good work In the saddle and the ruling
seems to be a very severe one.
Jack Thornton, a well known turfman
of Butte, Mont., was a spectator at the
races. Some years ago Mr. Thornton
raced a formidable string of horses over
the Eastern tracks.
In the opening race every jockey with a
mount was fined $25 by Starter Caldwell,
with the exceptions of Martin, Woods
and Jones.
Merry Heart, second choice In the open-
Ing event, was jumped on by Earl Isling
ton, nearly losing a portion of her off
hind foot.
The following are the weights assigned
in the Christmas handicap, two miles, to
be run over the Ingleside track on Mon
day next. Winners after the publication
of their weights will be compelled to car
ry five pounds extra.

A Decided Novelty.
The Christmas Wasp is out and pre
sents to the public one of the most ar
tistic as well as novel publications ever
Issued by any journal in the world. There
are sixty-four pages of pictures of San
Francisco, the like of which have never
before been seen, inasmuch as all hither
to accepted laws of photography are de
fled and views given of several streets
at once in a single photograph, showing
both sides of the streets in detail. The
principal thoroughfares of this city are
depicted in a peculiarly life-like manner.
The covers are in four colors and gold
and are extremely artistic. There is
plenty of interesting reading besides the
illustrated features, and the center illus
tration, giving a 24-inch photograve of
Golden Gate Park from Strawberry Hill
to the Panhandle, all in all, go to make
the Christmas Wasp the handsomest and
most interesting souvenir of the season.

Exposition Directors
Want Him.

Caustic Remarks of His Employ

Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
90S Broadway, Dec. 2L
Charles de Garmo Gray, who the di
rectors say mismanaged the OaJtland Ex
position, has left Oakland and cannot be
induced to return by the board of direct
ors. There are a few financial matters
â which the directors would also like to
arrange with Mr. Gray, but he has placed
his affairs in the hands of his attorney,
John E. Richards, and some warm corre
spondence lias taken place. As Mr. de
Garmo Gray's wife committed suicide at
l.os Angeles yesterday it was supposed
he had gone to attend her funeral, but
liis late assistant. Mi. Morrison, says
Mr. Gray has gone to Oregon.
"Our relations with Mr. Gray have been
most unsatisfactory," said Directors Kel
ler and Gier and Secretary Roeth to-day.
"He came to us so highly recommended
that we thought We could make no mis
take in entering into a contract with him.
Soon after the contract was signed we
learned through the PJnkerton detective
agency a great deal regarding Mr. (Cray,
and if without hurting the exposition we
<ould have made a change We would have
done so. However, we decided that Mr.
Gray's connection with us should be pure
ly managerial, and although thÂ« re is now
ii lit. l l - financial difficulty between us it
does not amount to a great deal. His
mismanagement of the exposition, how
ever, caused us a loss of J1600."
After the exposition closed Secretary
Jtoeth was surprised to receive a letter
from Gray's attorney ; i - k i n k for a state
ment of tne exposition finances. The let- i
ter said: "Mr. Gray informs me that
there wen earned some $2suo to $:>i.h)o for |
space and concessions and turned over to
the company; also $11*47 for admissions
and J.V.i for rent obtained by Mr. Gray
from the Republican committee, making
a total of about $47H7." Mr. Koeth replied
that "under the terms or" th*- contract it
is stated that there should be. a settlement !
of profit, and there being no profits there
can be no settlement."
Gray's attorney promptly replied to Sec
retary Roeth, stating that "The question
as to whether or not there are any
net profits arising out of the recent ex
position does not depend upon your opin
ion, but does depend upon a true and iust
accounting to be had between the Oakland
Exposition and Mr. dray. â¢ â¢ * In view
of the provisions of this contract, and of
your attitude toward him, Mr. Gray pro
poses to have a settlement with the cor
poration and to compel such a settlement,
if necessary. I inclose you on his behalf
a formal demand for the accounting and
settlement to which he is entitled. I am
Instructed also to inform you that if such
accounting is not given and such settle- i
ment made within three days after the
receipt of this letter an action will be '
â¦â¢ommenced against the corporation to '
compel the same."
Mr. Gray inclose*! wih his attorney's
letter a modest demand, as follows: "I !
hereby demand of you a full and detailed
accounting of all the receipts and ex
penditures of the exposition. 1 further de
mand the immediate payment to me of '
my proportion and percentage of th
profits of said exposition, due and pay
able to me by virtue of that certain con- '
tract entered Into with me August 18, 1895,
fey your corporation."
On receipt of this correspondence the
hoard of directors met; then they con
sulted with their attorney, George E. de '
Golla. and he mailed the* following lacts !
to Mr.. Gray and his attorney:
After reciting the nature of the con
tract, and referring to an attachment
brought in the Justices' court against'
Gray, it is stated that on December 3
there was coming to Gray a portion of his
â week's salary, fixed by contract at $4;i.
and that in view of the attachment this
could not be paid. The statement pro
ceeds:
After Gray had thi? notice of the attach
ment hf> cives an order to Director McCoy of
SAMPSON'S DAUGHTER
AWAITS HIS COMING
Henry Harrison Scott Leaves for the East To-
Niaht to Become the Rear Admiral's
Son-in-Law,
HENRY HARRISON SCOTT leaves for the East to-night to claim Miss :
Olive Sampson, daughter of Hear Admiral Sampson, for his bride. Wai- "
ter Magee. who is to be Mr. Scott's best man, will accompany him on his "
Eastern trip. ,
Tho wedding of the happy young couple will take place on Wednesday, -
January 4, 1899, at the Congregational church at Glen Ridge, New Jersey.' -
The bride will be attended by her sister, Miss Mamie Sampson, who is to offl- "
ciatf as maid of honor.
Mr. Scott has as yet. made no plans for the future, and he is undecided "
whether he will bring his bride to this city. [
the orchestra for $40 on Secretary Roeth. On
the following Saturday Mr. Gray goes to San
Francisco and collects from Caswell & Co.
;:'T 60 on account of their contract for space.
HÂ« sitjned the receipts in behalf of the ex
positloo. He had no more right or authority
to i.'llect that money than I had. The contract
provides that "the directors are to receive all
moneys and to pay all expenses." Mr. Gray
therefore received *::7 SO Which he has no right
to hold, and in behalf of the corporation I now
make demand upon him through you as Ills at
torney for the return of said sum received and
held by tiray for the corporation.
Furthermore, when the exposition first
; its doors, or about that time, at the
request of Mr. Gray there were placed in the
hands of the assistant manager 100 season
tickets, to be sold at the rate of SI each. Â£0 far
Gray has not accounted for tne proceeds of
these tickets, although the secretary has a
statement in which Mr. Gray i-har^ed him-
M If With 100 tickets. $37 50 collected from Cas
woll. and credited himself with 63 tickets. The
total amount thus accounted for is $137 50, but
this statement has never been recognized by
the board because It was already attached on
ttt Of Air. Gray and It does not propose to
pay his salary twice. Regarding the demand
for a detailed statement, let me say that the
total receipts from all sources were under $4100
anil the liabilities $6600, showing a lose of at
i>- urt $1400. Hence it is evident there are no
net profits to be divided. The books and vouch
ers of the corporation are open to the inspec
tion of yourself or Mr. Gray at any reasonable
time during business hours should you desire
to verify this statement. Hut I do not know
of any provision in the eontntet requiring the
directors to render you an itemized statement,
ms Mr. Gray is not a stockholder and has no
riÂ£ht cither than given him by the contract.
J,et me further sURS^st that Mr. Gray owes
the exposition six-sevenths of $40. deducted by
him from money he admits receiving nelonpins;
tn the corporation. Furthermore, I am told
that a bicycle turned over to the exposition
company in payment for space has been taken
away and appropriated by either Gray or his
assistant. This bicycle was valued at $40. and
dennnd Is hereby made upon you for the return
of #iis bicycle. Finally, let me surest that
the board of directors is more than wlllinp to
meet Mr. Gray In court, in which Proceeding?
they intend that the truth of this matter will
be fully ventilated.
It was agreed between the attorney and ;
the principal that a conference should be i
held at the exposition office last Monday !
afternoon, but at the appointed time !
neither Mr. Gray nor his attorney ap- ;
peared. This afternoon the assistant <
manager. Mr. Morrison, called at the !
office, but he had no authority to repre
sent Mr. Gray, and consequently the af- '
fairs of the exposition, so far as Mr.
Gray is concerned, are in a very unsatis- i
factory condition.
The dispatches from Los Angeles con- j
cerning the suicide of Mrs. de Garmo
Gray were :t surprise to the directors, for
<>n two occasions Gray obtained an ad
vance from Director Gier by representing >
that he wished to send money to his wife
In the south, who was staying there be
cause of poor health. The whole story of j
Gray's romantic married life with his fir*t j
wife, a London actress, appeared in The
Call of November 21. IS9S. Tt attracted con
siderable attention, as his wife was at
one time a craze among the devotees of |
the London stage. Gray was a companion j
of Williams, the South African schemer \
who had Bucb a meteoric career here and '
in San Francisco last fall.
This afternoon the bicycle which Gray j
took from the exposition was returned,
and the directors are wondering why it
should ever have been taken from the ex- j
position building to San Francisco.
Was Known in Chicago.
CHICAGO. Dec. 21.â Charles de Garmo, I
or. as he was known among intimates,
Count de Garmo. was well known in this
city among men about town as a bon vi
vant and a rounder for ten years prior j
to and including the World's Fair year. |
Hi possesses many attainments, and his!
society was much courted in certain cir
ri. -s where a dollar is an open sesame, j
and at that time he seemed to have dol
lars In plenty. In 3893 he was engaged in
the advertising business, having street
car privileges in a number of Western and I
Northwestern cities. His headquarters
were at 99 Washington street, this city, i
Early in 1594 De Garmo changed his name i
to Gray, and left ostensibly to go to Jo
hannesburg. South Africa, where he en- j
gaged in business, according to reports !
received by friends here, with a man 'â¢
named Williams or White, who a few ;
months ago figured in a sensational at
tempt to marry a San Francisco heiress.
About eighteen months ago De Garmo,
or Gray, returned to Chicago and an
nounced that he was going to Paris to
enjoy himself on the money he made in
South Africa. That was the last heard :
of him by his friends in sporting circles
until a Call man undertook to look up his ;
record to-night.
De Garmo professed to be a Kentuckian
of French extraction, and had some repu
tation as a gun fighter, though his prow- !
ess in that direction was never displayed,
while he was here. He was unmarried, !
so far as is known among his friends in :
this city.
A dispatch, from Portland, Or., says Dei
Garmo is thx-re.
Another Lady Lawyer.
OAKLAND, Dec. 21.â Johanna Daly has
petitioned for letters of administration on
the estate of her late husband. Jeremiah
Daly, the marine fireman, who was killed
in the boiler explosion on the Stockton
river steamer T. C. Walker on November
27 last. The estate consists of a home at
Fortieth and Grove streets, worth about
$1200. Diligent search has been made but
no will could be found. Incidentally an
interesting feature of the case is that Miss
.!â¢ ssie K. Watson of 1424 Eighth avenue,
East Oakland, appears as attorney for
the estate. This lady barrister is the first
of her sex who has attempted to practice
in local courts since Miss Frankie cre
ated such a ftir.here by her attempt to

Association.
THE SA^ FKAiNCISCO CALL, THTTRSPAT, DECEMBER 22, 1898.
WATER RIGHTS
INVOLVED IN A
LEGAL TANGLE
The Spring Valley
Company Sued.
ALAMEDA CREEK IS DIVERTED
JANE R. CLOUGH ASKS FOR A
PERPETUAL INJUNCTION.
The Washington and Murray Com
pany Deprived of Ten Million
Gallons of Water Each
Day.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Dec. 21.
An important suit, involving valuable
riparian rights in and to Alameda Creek,
was filed in the Superior Court of Ala
meda County to-day by Jane R. Clough
against the Spring Valley Water Works
<-t al. The other defendants are the
Washington and Murray Township Water
Company, Charles Webb Howard, W. A.
Yates, W. Brooks, John Mosier and H.
Overacker Sr. The suit is brought to
restrain the Spring Valley Water AVorks
from diverting the waters of Alameda
Creek and quiet title thereto. In 1871 the
Washington and Murray Township Com
pany acquired the right to the water in
the creek.
The complaint recites some decidedly
interesting facts of history portraying the
methods whereby a small corporation is
cinched in the tentacles of the more pow
erful one. Of the 60,000 shares in the
Washington and Murray Township Water
Company but 30,810 were issued and out
standing in April, ISSI. But at about that
time the Spring Valley Water Works
bought 28,960, the certificates being issued
as follows: In the name of the latter cor
poration, 3110 shares; Charles Webb How
ard, president of the Spring Valley Com
pany. 85,250 shares; Charles N. Fox, 100
shares; William Brooks, 200; W. A. Yates,
150; John Mosier, 100. \
The complaint further alleges that on
August 6, 1888, the Spring Valley caused
to be elected as directors of the Wash
ington anil Murray Township Water Com
pany Charles H. Hadsell, Charles Webb
Howard, Charles N. Fox, H. Overacker
Sr. and William Brooks. Mr. Hadsell
was chosen president and W. A. Yates
secretary.
Four days later the Spring Valley built
a dam across Alameda Creek, about two
miles above the head of- a ditch, golnjf
four miles along the line of water front,
covered by valuable riparian rights. This
stream ib natural, aÂ«d prior to its diver
sion flowed westerly between well-defined
banks from its source in the mountains
to the bay of San Francisco, and through
two tracts of land described in the com
plaint subdivided and owned by the fol
lowing small holders: A. J. Severance,
I). M. Sanborn, B. D. T. Clough, J. Nich
ols, J. Shinn, C. Kelsey, H. Overacker, A.
Kankin, W. F. Goad, H. Pierce, P. Mor
rlson J. Lnwry, J. T. Stevenson, M. S.
Peres, F. Munyan, W. Baker, F. George
J. Silvara, M. Ferelra, J. L. Beard and W.
Baker, in all about 2238 acres.
The ditch in question, according to the
complaint, had a capacity of 10,000,000 gal
lons of water per day of twenty-four
hour's, and its diversion deprives the
Washington and Murray Township Water
Company of all rights to said water.
Plaintiff a.sks that the court determine
the claims of the defendant, the Spring
Valley Water Works, in and to the waters
of Alameda Creek and adjudge that as
against the defendant Washington and
Murray Township Water Company the
former has no right to take or appropri
ate the water in the creek.
She also asks that the court perpetually
enjoin and restrain the Spring Valley
Water Works from using or diverting the
waters of Alameda Creek at any point
In said creek at or above the head of the
water ditch or at or above the tracts
mentioned.
Nearly two years ago J. L. Beard
brought suit against the Spring Valley
Water Works, recovering $ir,,000 damages.
The points involved were similar to those
set forth in the above plaintiff's com
plaint, but the court's decree did not re
strain tne water works from continuing
its diversion of the waters of the creek.
It Is asserted that recently Spring val
ley has spent $250,000 In the purchase of
riparian rights appurtenant to many
tracts bordering on Alameda Creek. This,
Mrs. Clough alleges, was done prepara
tory to fraudulently appropriating and
diverting the waters to the injury of
those who depended upon irrigation fur
nished by the ditch.
Mrs. Clough is a stockholder In the
"Washington and Mnrray Township Water
Company. In the present suit Thomas t.
Huxley appears as her attorney, with Wil
liam K. Davis of counsel.
J. W. LYNN IN COURT.
Many Alleged Criminals Appear for
Arraignment.
OAKLAND, Dec. 21.â John W. Lynn ap
peared before Superior Judge Ellswdrth
to-day for arraignment on a charge of
assault to murder his wife. Last Febru
ary Lynn shot his wife five times, and
during his preliminary examination he
was declared insane. Recently he was
returned from an insane asylum as cured,
and he will now have to stand trial. At
the request of his attorney, Hugh S.
Aldrich, the case went over until next
Tuesday to be set.
Before the same Judge Bengt Magnus
sen appeared on a charge of stealing a
house. He pleaded not guilty, and ihe
trial was set for February- 7, 1899.
J. P. Reddy, charged with criminally
assaulting a little girl in Alameda, and
incidentally being the man who Is sup
posed to have shot Officer Keys, was ar
raigned to plead to-day, but the matter
went over for one week.
The case of C. J. Sims, burglary', was
continued one week for arraignment, a3
was also the case of Richard Meade,
charged with burglary. W. 11. Allen,
charged with obtaining money under false
pretenses in connection with the Winters
Hotel deal, will plead two weeks hence.
She Wanted to Die.
OAKLAND, Dec. 21.â Because her lover
refused point blank to make up after a
quarrel with her on Thanksgiving day
Miss May Smith, aged 18 years, swallowed
a dose of carbolic acid with suicidal In
tent at an early hour this morning. At
the Receiving Hospital Steward Tobin
applied the stomach pump with success
ful results, and this afternoon the young
lady was out of danger.
Miss Smith says her parents reside at
490 Kleventh street, San Francisco, but
she has been away from home for about
a year. She committed her rash act at a
lodging house, corner of Eighth and
Washington streets. She has been keep
ing company with a young man named
Mose Coleman. who, friends sny. .lilted
her on Thanksgiving day. Yesterday she
received a letter, the contents of which
are presumed to have an unpleasant bear
ing upon this lovers' quarrel.
Change at the Blind Home.
OAKLAND, Deo. 21.â General W. T.
James resigned as chairman of the board
of directors of the Home for the Adult
Blind at a meeting of the board last
night, and Director H. O. Trowbridge was
elected to fill the vacancy. The present
board is composed of four Democrats-
Messrs. Glascock. Shaw, Smith and
Jamesâ and one Republican, Mr. Trow
bridge.
Given the Extreme Penalty.
OAKLAND. Dec. 21.â 1n the absence of
a whipping post for husbands who abuse
and beat their wives, as recently sug
gested by Police Judge Moore, that trib
une of justice to-day did the next best
thing. A. H. Ingersoll of 806 Castro street
was convicted on a charge of disturbing
the peace. More specifically he was
I charged with having driven his wife and
children out of the house with a hatchet
during the storm last Monday night. â¢ The
maximum penalty is $200 fine or ninety
days in jail or both. The sentence doled
out to Ingefsoll by Judge Moore includes
both.
CHEESEMAN TO BE TRIED.
H. J. Brooke's Slayer Declared Per
fectly Sane by Asylum Physician.
OAKLAND, Dec. 21. â Another al
leged murderer was brought to the Coun
ty Jail to-night to go through the for
mality of a trial. Frank H. Cheeseman,
who shot and killed Henry J. Brooke last
August and then attempted to muruer
the latter's step - daughter, Etta M.
Payne, with whom he had been keeping
company, was discharged to-day from tne
insane asylum at Ukiah as not insane.
He was brought back to the jail to-night
by Deputy Sheriff Al White.
Usually those who regain their reason
are discharged from the asylum as
"cured." In Cheeseman's case, however,
the discharge reads "discharged as not
Insane." Dr. E. W. King, at the Ukiah
asylum, is one of the most clever experts
extant, and states that Cheeseman never
was insane, but that he very cleverly
feigned it.
Cheeseman appeared very rational at
the County Jail to-night. He said, how
ever, that he remembered nothing about
the shooting, but had read of the affair
in the newspapers at the asylum.
Cheeseman was at Ukiah about two
months, but he insists it was about four
and that it seemed like a year. Cheese
man's case will be set for trial as soon
as he secures attorneys.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Dec. 21.
The Police Commissioners appointed
Sergeant John Morrison to the position of
police captain this morning. Patrolman
Jack Soanlon â¢ promoted to fill the
vacant sergeantcy.
Nlcolaus Williams, a patrolman, peti
tioned the board to appoint him to the
vacant captaincy, but his petition was
merely read and place on Me.
City Attorney Dow brought up the mat
ter by asking his two brother Commis
sioners if they were going 1 to fill the va
cancies on the police force. The Mayor
said he wanted to talk with the Chief of
Police before doing anything. '"The mat
ter has been dragging so long that I
think we ought to settle it." said Mr.
Dow, "so 1 will introduce something on
the subject." As he spoke he tossed, to
the secretary a resolution providing for
the appointment of Sergeant Peterson as
a police captain. Thomas and Clement
voted th'.s down, and the Mayor nomin
ated Sergeant Morrison. This was favor
able to Cltinent and, after voting no, Mr.
Dow changed and made the appointment
unanimous.
Mr. Dow then introduced a resolution
appointing Charles liammerton from pa
trolman to sergeant. The Mayor named
Officer Scanlon: City Engineer Clement
also named Scanlon. and he was appoint
ed. Mr. Dow voting no. Mr. Dow then
said It would be advisable to name a man
to 11 11 the vacancy caused by Scanlon's
promotion. lie named Special Officer
â¢ Miarles Clark. The Mayor said he was
not prepared to act at this time as there
are a number of changes to be made in
the department and wanted more time.
Mr. Clement had no nomination to make,
and, therefore, the matter was laid over.

WEDDED FOR FIFTY YEARS
THERE was a big gathering of the Danish colony in the St. Nicholas Hotel last
Tuesday evening. The occasion was the celebration of the golden wedding
of Mr. and Mrs. Christian Christensen, and it was a happy company of rela
tives and friends that sat down to the wedding supper in the hotel banquet
hall.
On December 19, 1848, Christian Christensen and Anna Katherine Petersen were
married in Schleswlg. which was at that time a part of Denmark. Ten years
later they came to the United States, and finally settled in California, They pur
chased a ranch near Petaluma, and lived on it until 1863. In that year they re
turned to Denmark with the intention of spending the rest of their life there, but
the war with Germany broke out, and ended in their birthplace becoming a portion
of the German empire. They therefore returned to their ranch in California,
and lived there until 1888, when they moved to San Francisco, and have made
thrir home at 211 Steiner street ever since. Mr. and Mrs. Christensen are both 75
years of age, and were born within a few weeks of each other.
Among the invited guests were: H. H. Berkholm, Danish Consul; Mrs. H. H.
Berkholm; ex-Danish Consul John Simpson and wife; H. Ravn and Mrs. J. Peter
sen, nephew and niece of the happy couple; J. Petersen, Harry, Alma and Meta
Petersen. Lorenz Ford, Mr. and Mrs. James Madison, W. P. Nielson, Miss Helena
Nielson. C. M. Beck, Harry de Lasaux, Miss Cecelia Decker, M. Salomon, Paul
Engel, Miss Herta Meyer and Mrs. C. M. Beck.
The parlors and banquet hall of the hotel were beautifully decorated for the
occasion. James Madison acted as toastmaster. and on behalf of their many
friends he presented the couple with a solid gold easel, on which rested a gold
card. The pictures of Mr. and Mrs. Christensen had been reproduced on it in
enamel, and the dates of their wedding and golden wedding were inscribed
thereon also.
SEXTON HAS
A HISTORY
OF MYSTERY
Strange Pull With the
Southern Pacific.
ALWAYS ESCAPES TROUBLE
WAS CLOSE TO FAIR AND C. P.
HTTNTINGTON.
Once Passed Some Months Waiting
Trial for Forgery in the
Alameda County-
Jail.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Dec. 21.
Oaklanders were surprised to learn that
John E. Sexton, "the man of mystery,"
is now under arrest at Sacramento lor
operating on the confidence plan. Sex
ton's home, so far as he has any, Is in
Oakland, although he has not been seen
here for some time. He is a most myste
ious man, and some of his Oakland esca
pades and the manner in which he was
able to clear himself have long been a
surprise.
In March two years ago he was on trial
for forgery in Judge Ellsworth's court,
but escaped conviction. On that occa
sion he was charged with forging the
name of Bob Boyer, a well-known cigar
merchant, to a Wells-Fargo check. At
the first trial he was acquitted through
the agency of the Almighty, only one
juror not favoring conviction, and he ex
plained his position by stating that he
had prayed to be directed aright and God
had told him to acquit Sexton.
Sexton was kept in jail from December
19 to the following March, and was made
very comfortable in his cell, but refused,
to accept bail, although Southern Pacific
officials expressed a willingness to go on
his bond. At the second trial he was ac
quitted.
During his confinement in the jail here
he had but two books in his cell, and he
was always studying one or the other.
One was Webster's Dictionary, the other
a manual of American railways. He was
not educated at school, but in spite of
this and although he is but 28 years old,
he is recognized as one" of the best of
civil engineers, skilled especially in the
branches of hydrostatics and hydrodynam
ics. He is a telegraph operator, an electri
cian, and is thoroughly posted concerning
railroads all over the country.
He claimed to be very closely asso
ciated wi^h Collis P. Huntington and was
also a confidant of the late Senator Fair,
and he succeeded In doing some clever
work for the Senator that brought down
<<n him the enmity of Banner R. H. Mc-
Donald.
At his trial in this city A. D. Wilder
and several other Southern Pacific peo
ple testified on his behalf, and the trial,
although on a comparatively petty
chargo, created as much interest as one
for murder on account of the mystery
surrounding the defendant.
One of the police detectives remembers
an incident which showed that Sexton's
claim to importance in railroad circles
has a good foundation. "Sexton was
standing at Seventh and Broadway,"
said the detective, "when the unattached
locomotive that runs through from Fruit
vale to the mole after midnight ap
proached. Sexton wanted to get to West
Oakland. I told him the last car had
gone. 'Then I'll make this fellow take
me down," said Sexton, referring to the
engineer. As the locomotive passed Sex
ton commanded the engineer to stop. He
recognized the man and" brought the lo
comotive to a standstill in the middle of
the block. I told him to run to get
aboard, but instead of doing so he shout
ed to the engineer, 'Here, you; come
back to this corner for me,' whereupon
the locomotive was backer to the cross
ing where Sexton stood."
YON SCHMIDT WILL CONTEST.
No Alimony for His Wife if He Can
Prevent It.
ALAMEDA, Dec. 21.â Alameda society
was shocked when It read this morning
In The Call the story of the domestic
troubles of Mr. and Mrs. E. A. yon
Schmidt. The husband's story, published
exclusively in this paper, was the first
Intimation the friends of the couple had
that peace and happiness was not the
rule in the yon Schmidt household. Mrs.
yon Schmidt had taken an active part
In society affairs, and was a prominent
member of many charitable organiza
tions, but she never hinted to any of her
large circle of acquaintances that her do
mestic relations were not the most pleas
ant.
But on top of all this Captain yon
Schmidt adheres to the idea that some of
the women friends of his wife prompted
her to commence the divorce proceedings
against him. He says these were close
acquaintances of his wife's deceased
mother.
The captain's friends speak of him in
the highest terms. They say he was a
man of many eccentricities and an ex
ceedingly hot temper, but the last one in
the world to aouse a woman, much less
his wife.
The whereabouts of Mrs. yon Schmidt
and the children is still unknown to the
husband. It is known that they came
from Oakland this afternoon, visited the
home at 2221 Central avenue, secured
some necessary articles of clothing, and
returned to the city across the estuary.
Friends of the parties are making efforts
to bring about a reconciliation, but thus
far have made but little headway. Mr.
yon Schmidt placed the case in the hands
of his attorneys, instructing them to
exert every means to prevent his wife se
curing alimony, and to contest her suit
from every legal standpoint. He will
make no effort to secure the custody of
the children, but is ready to make every
provision for their maintenance and edu
cation.

PREPARED A
ROPE FOR A
FIRE FIEND
GREAT EXCITEMENT IN
TIBURON.
Henry Young, Proprietor of a Build=
ing Suspiciously Burned, Set
Upon by a Frenzied Mob.
Attempted Suicide
of His Wife.
Never before in its history has the little
town of Tiburon on the Marin County
shore witnessed such tragic and exciting
events as came to pass last Tuesday
evening and yesterday morning. They be
gan with an attempt, planned with devil
ish ingenuity by a fire fiend, to lay the
place in asht-s, quickly followed by the
arrest on suspicion of Henry Young, a
wealthy hotel man and merchant, and a
determined effort on the part of the in
furiated populace to lynch the alleged
author of the outrage. Cooler heads
averted this breach of law and the citi
zens were growing calmer, when the ex
cltement again rose to fever pitch by a
desperate effort on the part of Mrs.
Young to end her life in the waters of the
bay. All that night and until the arrival
of "the authorities from San Rafael at an
early hour yesterday morning it was
found necessary to keep Young and a
clerk named Edward Butler under armed
espionage in order to preserve their lives.
Several minor happenings added to the
furor, one being a clashing of Attorney
James W. Cochrane and Deputy Consta
ble Fletcher, which ended in the muscular
limb of the law throwing the officer bodily
out of a room and locking the door to
prevent his return.
About 10 o'clock Tuesday evening Fred
Hackett, the proprietor of the El Dorado
saloon, heard the sound of an explosion
in the store of Young & Mitchell, known
as the "Daily Supply." He listened in
tently, and, hearing another explosion,
ran round into the narrow alley between
the buildings and perceived that the rear
of the "Daily Supply" was in flames. His
cries elicited no response from within, and
he dashed out into the street, yelling
"flre." A large crowd rushed to the
scene. Jerry O'Connell, Engineer Joseph
Wasaer and Expressman William Lewis
aided Hackett In breaking in both the
rear and front doors of the building with
heavy billets of wood. Both doors had
been locked and barricaded with boxes

and bedding. Hackett succeeded in ex
tinguishing the fire in the rear with a
garden hose, when loud cries showed that
there were other sources of the blaze.
The crowd that poured in was simply
wild with rage when it was discovered
that fires had been started simultaneously
in six different rooms. The incendiary
meant business. Boxes and bedding,
kindling wood and other inflammable ma
terial had been piled in each room and
saturated with kerosene, while cans of
gasoline were scattered about, with the
tops of the cans pried open, so the fire
would catch more quickly. In one side
ruom had been placed a large can of
powder, also with the top open. It sat in
the center of the floor, away from the
kindling wood, In order not to explode
until the flames had gained considerable
headway.
All the blazes were soon extinguished,
but not until two cans of gasoline nad ex
ploded and set the walls on fire. The
buildings in the vicinity are closely
packed, and the whole town would have
been at the mercy of the flames if the fire
had been discovered two minutes later.
Shortly after the fire alarm had been
given Young rushed out of the saloon of
N. R. Hansen, a few doors distant, and
into the side .nor of the burning struc
ture. He soon reappeared, carrying his
litt'.e boy, and closely followed by his
wife. They repaired to the Sonoma
House, of which Young was proprietor
until yesterday.
A howling mob soon gathered, and
crios of ' r Lynch him!" "Kill him!"
"Don't let him get away!" rang out.
Deputy Constable Fletcher arrested
Young, and the crowd tried to take the
prisoner away from the officer, but many
of the cooler heads begged the infuriated
and unruly element to wait and not do
anything that would lead to the shedding
of' blood. Several ran for a rope, but
when they returned Fletcher had his
charge in the upper story of tne wrecked
building- where he had lived with his wife
and child. George Pearas and Patrick
Wright were armed and Placed on guard,
closely watching the prisoner to prevent
his committing suicide. His little boy
was taken away and placed in the care
of Mrs. Wasser and Mrs. Barnum.
While the crowd was still surging about
and murmuring sullenly there came a suc
cession of piercing screams from the di
rection of the wharves. John and Michael
Clancey and Engineer James Donohoe
were the first to reach the spot. Mrs.
Young had jumped into the bay on hear
ing of the arrest of her husband, but
when Fireman Clancey lowered a long
handled fire-scraper she repented of the
deed and took hold of the end. Boatman
Charles Trulson jumped into a skiff and
soon rescued the woman from the water.
She then lost consciousness and was taken
to the Sonoma House and placed under
the care of several ladies, but did not re
gain her senses for nearly two hours. Her
first thought was for her child, -which
was brought to her.
Few of the citizens went to bed during
the night and yesterday morning the talk
of lynching was renewed. Deputy Fletch
er wanted Captain Charles McNeill to
take the prisoner to Sausallto, as well as
the clerk, Edward Butler, who had been
arrested and forced to pass the night
in the calaboose. Attorney James w.
Cochrane arrived at this juncture and de
murred to such a proceeding. He wished
to speak with Young and was told he
could not. Cochrane retorted that Young
had only been arrested on suspicion and
not on a warrant and that he would see
him. He forced his way into the room
and after talking with his client managed
to get him to the Sonoma House to confer
with his wife. Fletcher followed and tried
to prevent them from entering the room
where Mrs. Young lay in bed. Failing, he
rushed in after them and seized Young.
They both had a rough and tumble fight
on the floor. When they arose Cochrane,
assisted by the arrested man, caught hold
of the officer and threw him bodily from
the room. They were then permitted to
consult with one another unmolested.
Constable Lewis Hughes arrived on the
11:10 o'clock train from San Rafael and
took the two prisoners to the county seat.
A long conference was held in the Dis
trict Attorney's office at the conclusion of
which Butler was released, but Young
was guarded by Hughes while Martinelll
and his regular corps of satellites re
turned to Tiburon to search for evidence.
Returning Hughes swore to a complaint
charging Young with arson. He was tak
en before Justice Rodden and his bail
was fixed at $2000. It was furnished by
Attorney M. F. Cochrane and John Pol
thenius, a butcher doing business at 1761
Stockton street. Young was permitted to
go free, but on the advice of Cochrane
stayed in San Rafael and sent for his
wife and child. The citizens freely assert
that he will be mobbed if he sets foot in
the town.
Under the advice of his attorney the
prisoner refuses to speak about the af
fair. The lawyer says his client tells him
he is ignorant as to who did the deed.
Young Butler simply says it was "raw
work." He closed up the store and left
it at 8 o'clock, an hour earlier than usual,
being accompanied by the proprietor.
Saloon-keeper Hansen says Young came
into his place an hour before the fire was
discovered and played cards until the
alarm was given. The officials believe
there was an accomplice. Thomas
Mitchell, the partner, who ran the So
noma House for Young, and was his
partner in the grocery and saloon busi
ness, went to Fresno last Tuesday to file
certain attachments, and is dally expected
to return.
There are several things that look bad
for Young. The store was closed earlier
than usual; he was preparing to leave
town, and had a deal on hand to sell out
to B. I. Landon of San Rafael. It went
through to-day. The hotel fixtures were
insured for $1700, and yet they brought
hardly more than one-third that amount
at the sale. The fixtures and stock of the.
stora and saloon were insured for $1000.
Young is a Swede, and came from South
Africa about four years ago. He is re
puted to be worth between $20,000 and $30,
000. His wife is of the same nationality.
She conducted a bakery at Johannesburg.
She will say nothing except that she will
kill herself as soon as she gets a chance.
Many believe her to know all about the
affair.
The excitement had not abated last
night, and it will not be safe for Young
to return to Tiburon.
We have Just received about 200 16x20
colored photo-panels, mounted on glass,
with large projecting corners. Coming in

to close them out before Christmas. First

Blackman and Frank H. Rood, saloon
keeper on Valencia street, charged with
grand larceny, was called in Judge Mo

to transfer the case, as he denied having
any bias or prejudice against the defend
ants.
The preliminary examination of the de
fendants was then commenced. Cornelius
Cronin, the complaining witness, testified
to being taken by Blackman to Rood's sa
loon, where he was compelled to give up
his money, $255; to being afterward taken

to the Valencia Hotel and back again to
Rood's saloon, where he was handed $75,
which he took under protest. The old
man's cross-examination lasted for over
two hours, but his evidence was not
shaken in any of the material facts.
John Halm, a saloon-keeper at 903 Kear
ny street, who lives on San Carlos ave
nue, testified to being in Rood's saloon
when he saw Cronin hand over his money
and heard them say that the amount was
$255. In cross-examination Halm said he
had a few drinks that night, and being
pressed admitted that he had taken twen
ty drinks, but added that he was even
then only half full. His cross-examina
tion was not concluded when the court
adjourned. The hearing will be resumed

MONEY TO
PAY ALL THE
WAR BILLS
Governor Budd Will
Disburse $40,000.
THE CASH IS ON HAND
FORTY-THREE THOUSAND TO BE
PAID INTO TREASURY.
Attorney General Fitzgerald Advises
the Executive as to the Method
of Settling the Ac
counts.
On account of money disbursed, supplies
distributed and obligations incurred in
the transportation of troops in the earlier
stages of the late wax the State of Cali
fornia presented a claim against the Uni
ted States for the Bum of $160,000. On
ordnance account the Federal Govern
ment was credited with $60,000. The Gov
ernment made a cash payment by check I
on the United States Treasury for the
sum of $83,311 05. The check was brought
here from Washington by Adjutant-Gen
eral Barrett. A claim for $18,000 still re
mains to be adjusted.
To liquidate obligations Incurred on be
half of the United States by the Gov
ernor of California the sum of $40,000 will
be disbursed to-day. The accounts to
be settled embrace money advanced to
the Governor, quartermaster, commissary
and medical supplies furnished and bills
for charges for the transportation of
troops. The question was submitted to
Attorney General Fitzgerald whether the
United States check for $83,311 03 should
be paid into the treasury of the State
and payment made therefrom to the par
ties presenting claims against the State,
or should the Governor disburse the
money to pay bills contracted and submit
the receipts as his vouchers.
The Attorney General ruled that the
supplies purchased by the Governor
for the use of the United States should
be paid for directly from the allowance
made by the Federal Government. After
the disbursement of $40,000 to pay for ma
terials and subsistence ordered directly
by the Governor there will remain $43,000,
which Governor Budd* will to-day pay
into the State treasury. This sum of $43,
000 will reimburse the State for materials
and medical supplies which belonged to
the State of California, and which were
furnished to the troops called into the
service of the United States.
California's claim was the first allowed
by the United States. The early and fa
vorable action thereon was due to the
fact that vouchers were correctly sub
mitted and straight accounts rendered
of all financial transactions on which
claims against the United States were
reimbursed for all moneys paid out and
supplies furnished for the General Gov
ernment.

the municipal board he has made for him
self a reputation as a man who delighted
to differ from his colleagues, and one
who was generally hunting trouble in his
official position. In this case trouble has
been thrust upon him. He had received a
letter from the City Clerk refusing to
spread on the minutes of the City Trus
tees his testimonial to Marshal Rogers,
for the reason that the document of
scarcely more than one hundred words
strayed away from the rules of the Eng
lish language in nearly thirty instances.
Following is a verbatim copy of the
document:
To the Honorable Board of Trustees of the
City of Alameda

Mr. Brick was formerly a member of
the Board of Free Library Trustees, a
position he held for twelve years. He
selected all of the classical works now
on the shelves of the library. When the
reporters went to copy the unique docu
ment in question they pointed out the er-
I rors to the Clerk. He was at a loss as
to how to instruct the minute clerk to
transcribe Mr. Brick's effusion, and

sought the City Attorney for legal ad
vice. Mr. Taylor told him that he had no
authority to change a letter or a punctu
ation mark in any document filed with
him for the purpose of being spread on
the city's records to go down in history.
The Clerk thereupon addressed a com
munication to Mr. Brick advising him of
the condition of affairs and requesting
him to make the necessary corrections in
the document before it would be spread
(in the minutes. Mr. Brick has treated
the letter with silent contempt, and the
testimonial to Sheriff-elect Rogers has
i not yet been entered on the public records
i of the city.
At the last meeting of the City Trustees
Mr. Brick assailed the newspapers for
publishing the proceedings of a secret
: meeting of the ..board, when he claimed
' the exclusive privilege of naming the sue-
I cessor of City Marshal Rogers, who re
â¢ signed to assume the duties of Sheriff.
! In the course of his remarks Mr. Brick
said: "Of course the reports were garbled
and made up of a tissue of lies, but I as
sure you I would not have said a word of
it if I had thought it was going to be
printed."
