THAT PEACE IS AT HAND
SPOIN SINCERE
IN NEGOTIATIONS
|O END THE WOR.
Information Received Causes tl}e Wash
ington Authorities to Believe Tf}at
the i^adrid Government Will
flcgept the Conditions to
jf Be Proposed.
NEW YORK, July 28.4-The
Washington correspondent of
the Herald sends the follciving:
That peace is in sight is thf con
fident belief of President A?.-fv'n
ley and most of his official ad
rs as the result of information
which came to them to-day
through official and newspaper
channels. A long cipher cable
message was received by Secre
tary Day this morning from Em
bassador Porter at Paris on the
subject of peace negotiations.
The contents of this dispatch
were carefully guarded from the
bttt I am a>ured that it
has had the effect of convincing
the authorities here that Spain is
really sincere in the peace negoti
ations which she has inaugurated
and wants and will have peace
upon the best terms she can ob-
trail.
The Herald has accurately
outlined the general terms
which the President will submit
to Spain and which must be ac
cepted by Spain before the ad
ministration will consent to an
armistice for the purpose of per
fecting the details of the final
agreement for ending the war.
Information received to-day has
led the authorities to believe thai
Spain will accept these condi
tions.
With these principles accepted
by Spain as conditions prelimi
nary to the appointment of peace
commissioners for the purpose of
concluding all details incident to
a complete agreement for ending
the war, peace will be assured,
notwithstanding the many ugly
and complex questions to be set
tled with regard to the future
government of the Philippines.
President McKinley now ex
pects to be able to^end for Em
bassador Cambon on Saturday
and give him his reply to Spain.
Secretary Day has made a rough
draft of the note embodying
these terms, and he and the Pres
ident went over it at the White
House to-day. This note will
REPORTED FALL OF
MANILA AND THE
PEACE PROSPECTS
Special Cable to the Call and the New York Herald, Copyrighted. 189? â¢ by
James Gordon Bennett.
MADRID, July 28. â The Government, it is stated, has
received a telegram announcing the surrender of Manila to
Admiral Dewey.
It is understood that the peace negotiations entered
upon will be conducted from London either by Monet or
Bernabe, probably the former. Marshal Martinez Campos
has issued a declaration in favor of immediate peace. So
has General Azcarraga. The papers express indignation
against the United States that hostilities were not ceased
upon Spain's declaration that she wished peace. The Stock
Exchange has boomed upon peace prospects. Most stocks
have gone up five points.
The San Francisco Call
form the basis of discussion at to
morrow's Cabinet meeting when
all the members will be present.
The one great bone of conten
tion will be the Philippine prob
lem. This feature of the rough
draft of the note remains as out
lined in the Herald this morning
â the permanent cession to the
United States of a coaling station
in the Philippine Islands with a
cast-iron agreement which will
bind Spain to a form of govern
ment satisfactory to the people of
the island in case she is allowed
to maintain her sovereignty.
Further discussion at the Cab
inet meeting to-morrow may
somewhat change this pro
gramme, but I am able to repeat
what I said in the Herald this
morning, that both the President
and Secretary Day are at present
in favor of making terms of peace
which do not contemplate the
permanent control of the Philip
pines by the United States. It
remains to be seen whether this
will be changed by the delibera
tion at the Cabinet meeting to-
morrow.
There is a possibility that news
from Admiral Dewey within the
next twenty-four hours may
show a development that will ne
cessitate the recasting of the
terms that will be demanded in
connection with the control of
the Philippines. The question is
too farreaching in its effect upon
the politics of the world for the
administration to say at this time
just what form of government is
desirable for the future manage
ment of affairs in the Philippines.
While the President is not
averse to permitting Spain to re
tain sovereignty over the Philip
pines, provided our demands for
coaling stations are complied
with, he appreciates that the
United States is morally bound
in the interests of humanity and
civilization to see that there is a
stable and satisfactory form of
government established in the is
lands. How this is to be ar

ranged if Spain is to retain her
sovereignty is, of course, a great
problem, and one which involves
negotiations with the insurgents
to see what terms can be made
with them and to some extent the
views of foreign powers.
The most that the administra
tion can do at the present time
in answering Spain's appeal for
peace is to state in general terms
what we will concede in regard
to the Philippines, and leave the
details as to the future govern
ment to be workcvi out.
As previously stated in the
Herald, the President will open
ly and frankly submit the lowest
terms acceptable to the United
States at the present time. His
reply will be in the nature of an
ultimatum with a warning im
plied that a delay in accepting
will mean more rigid demands,
involving a large indemnity if the
war is continued.
PREPARED TO CEDE
CUBA TO AMERICA
Special rnbie tn The Call and the Xew York
HeraM. Copyrighted. 1898, by James Gor
don Uennett.
MADRID, July 28.â Most contradic
tory notices circulate here in regard to
peace negotiations. I am informed by
a Spanish gentleman who makes it his
business to feel the public pulse that it
is generally accepted that the war is
now at an end. My opinion is that his
statement is very premature.
In well-informed circles it Is stated
that Spain is prepared to cede Cuba to
an American protectorate, concede the
possession of Porto Rico and a suitable
coaling station in the Philippines.
It is estimated that the Americans
will not seek the island of Luzon, ow
ing to the difficulties that would be en
countered there in restoring order
among su^h wild and undisciplined
people as the Tagalas. Apropos of the
much discussed attitude of the Cuban
volunteers, an important politician has
received letters from influential person
ages in Havana confirming jwhat has
already been stated in these columnsâ
namely, if Americans engage to pro
tect Spanish rights and property, they
will accept an American protectorate
with equanimity.
The King's illness Is of the nature of
an eruptive fever. The statement that
it Is scarlet fever Is not confirmed. It
is important at this moment that Gen
eral Weyler has declared he will not
In any way oppose the negotiations for
peace.
The Imparcial, the effete paper,
which is also a yellow paper and meet
ing the same fate in the public minds
as its colleagues of New York, to-day
publishes another ridiculous article
suggesting that the Madrid corre
spondent of the Herald be expelled.
The fact that the Imparcial makes the
suggestion Is a sure sign the corre
spondent will remain here, as the Im
parelal Is the most unpopular paper in
Madrid on account of its dubious con
duct since the war began. Its silly ar
ticle to-day is headed "Toupet Yan
kee." .
PUGET SOUND HAS BEEN
WITHOUT PROTECTION
Mines for the Entrance Arrive When
the Danger of Spanish At-
tack Is Past.
SEATTL.E, July 28.â Two carloads of
buoyant submarine mines arrived from
the East to-day. They were consigned to
Cantain Harry Taylor, U. S. A., and
were at once transported by steamer to
the Port Orchard station.
The waters of the sound were supposed
to have been fortified and protected with
mines weeks ago, but the work was never
done. Owing to unavoidable delay the
mines for Admiralty Head and the junc
ture of the straits and Puget Sound have
just arrived. It is not expected that the
Government will now place them.

INTERFERENCE
OF THE POWERS
TO BE RESISTED
PresideQt Mcryinley Not to Permit
Meddling ir) the Settlement
With Spain.
NEW YORK, July 28.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs
the following: Appreciating the possi
bility of the intervention of European
powers in peace negotiations with
Spain, President McKinley is making
preparations to aggressively resist,
should it be attempted.
Apparently the only nation in Eu
rope from which annoyance is consid
ered possible is Germany, and whiie
the officials assert that there aro no
questions of a troublesome character
pending between the two governments
there is every reason to believe that a
sharp watch is being kept upon the ac
tions and policy of Emperor William
with respect to the Philippines.
It is only from developments relating
to the far eastern possessions of the
Spanish crown that the administration
expects complications, as it is conceded
in diplomatic circles that no objection
will be raised by any power to the ac
quisition by the United States of both
Cuba and Porto Rico.
The bringing of a new and powerful
nation into the field, which is the sub
ject of contention among European
powers, with a certainty that its policy
will be Identical with that of Great
Britain and Japan, the Philippine Isl
ands, diplomats here say, Is as much
of a problem to continental Europe as
to the United States,-with as great dan
ger of complications for one as for the
other. Diplomatic friends of Germany
In Washington assert that the fear of
interference by her In the prospective
peace negotiations is groundless. [t
was pointed out to me to-day that
there is not a German man-of-war in
Manila harbor to-day, and the with
drawal of the fleet stationed in that
harbor some time ago was entirely due,
it was authoritatively stated, to the ar
rival of a large American military force
and the certainty that when Manila fell
German Interests would be safely
guarded.
"This action conclusively shows,"
said my informant, who is a well in
formed diplomat, "that Germany is
willing to leave her subjects and her
interests to the protection of Rear Ad
miral Dewey and the American sol
diers. Before the arrival of troops the
apprehension existed in Germany that
the insurgents would capture and loot
the City of Manila, perhaps injuring
German subjects and their property.
"While Rear Admiral Dewey could
have destroyed the town with his guns
he might not have been able to hold the
Insurgents in check. The American
troops now at Cavite are amply able to
take care of the city and the foreign
population, and as soon as this wns
evident all the German warships were
withdrawn. Had Germany entertained
any designs upon the Philinnines, do
you think she would have withdrawn
all of her ships and sent them to the
Chinese coast? Would not it have been
advisable to retain them In Philippine
waters?
"If Manila is ceded to the United
States Germany will not object. The
German Government, at the instance of
its people, made Kiochou an open port,
and Manila, as an American possession,
will also be an open port into which
German merchantmen can sail and
trade. Therefore it is to the interest
of Germany for the United States to
occupy it.
"France Is not strong enough to resist
the acquisition of the Philippines by
herself, and Russia will not act with
her â for one reason because of Russia's
traditional friendship for the United
States, and for another reason because
her bases in the far east are still in a
weak condition. There is the trans-
Siberian railroad yet to be completed,
and over this it will be necessary to
transport supplies and men to Vladi
vostock and Port Arthur. Perhaps
this fact may explain Russia's friend
ship for Japan at this time, of which
Japan, I think, is becoming suspicious."
DEWEY IS ROUNDING UP
ELEVEN SPANISH CRAFT
Raleigh and Concord Sent in Search
of Scattered Ships of the
Enemy.
NEW YORK, July 28. â A cablegram
from Hongkong to the Journal says
that Admiral Dewey at Manila has
dispatched the Raleigh and Concord to
gather up eleven Spanish craft, which,
according to information sent him by
Consul General Wildman, are at vari
ous places in the Philippine archipel
ago. Among these vessels are three
gunboats at San Miguel, Luzon Island,
and four at Port Royal, Palawar Island.
Four merchantmen with cargoes of to
bacco are reported at Cagayan, Luzon.
The same dispatch reports that English
traders at the coal mines of Battn,
Luzon Island, have been Imprisoned
and subjected to ill treatment by the
Spaniards there.

Colonel Wood's Military Methods

Senor Ros.
Special cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted. ISSS, by James Gor
don Bennett.
SANTIAGO, July 28. â Senor Ros,
Civil Governor of Santiago, to-day ex
pressed great indignation at what he
termed the "high handed" manner in
which General Wood, the new Mili
tary Governor, is performing the du
ties of his office. In an interview for
The Call and Herald, Senor Ros said
to me:
"The American Military Governor is
riding rough shod over local reguia
tlons, and is not acting in accordance
with President McKinley's proclama
tion. For instance, he has stopped
the collection of municipal taxes on
goods intended for local consumption,
as a result of which order the city
government will soon be without
money and without harbor improve
ments."
Senor Ros also objected to the order
dissolving the harbor board and char
acterized the order requiring house
holders to report deaths as "most op-

The energy which the Americans dis

Secretary Alger is deeply concerned
over the welfare of the gallant troops

The health reports show a surprisingly
large number of cases of sickness, but
army surgeons authorize the statement
â¢that these figures are misleading in a
certain sense, and that the situation
may not be nearly so had as they
would seen to indicate. The slightest
ailment of the most temporary nature

AT BALLARD POINT
Artillerymen in Expectation of Or

SAN' DIEGO, July 28.â The quarters of
the army post at Ballast Point are com
pleted and are occupied by Battery D,
Third Regiment of heavy artillery, under
command of Captain Charles Humphreys.
Lieutenants Bennett and Patterson hav
ing been detached and assigned to duty
at San Francisco temporarily, Captain
Humphreys Is alone to perform the mani
fold duties at the post. It is believed that
Battery D will soon be called to perform
ictiv duty than guarding the mine
fields in the harbor by day, and that It
â¢will eventually be Bent to Manila, whore
there is likely to be much need of artil
lery.
There is a great scarcity of artillery of
ficers in the army at present, as many of
th<^m have been drawn from the five old
regiments t.> take commands in those or
ganized since the outbreak of war.
Then- art- eighty-three men at the Bal
last Point post and three disappearing
guns, and it is proposed to have a fourth
gun mounted on the bluff close to Point
Loma. commanding the entrance to the
Ban Diego channel.
The War Department evidently experts
Captain Humphreys with his men to look
out for everything pertaining to his post
â¢without any assistance from subordinates
and quartermasters, but so long 1 as they
do not deprive him of his sergeants and
corporals he hopes to maintain the effi
ciency of his command at Ballast Point.
Lieutenant James J. Meyler of the en

the direction of the Secretary, a few
days ago inspected a tract of land ad
joining Montauk Point, Long Island,
belonging to the Lung Island Railroad
Company, which has been offered to
the Government as suitable for a large

The tract is three miles square, con

considerable lake, a hill 150 feet in
height and many other sanitary advan

necessary orders to equip this as a

placed upon him being that he shall
not delay the homeward sailing of his

INACTIVITY CAUSES
MANY DESERTIONS
Demoralization of the Fifth Illinois
Regiment Attributable to
Circumstances.
WASHINGTON. July 28.â 1t Is re
ported from Chickamauga that because
the Fifth Illinois Regiment was turn
ed back from the Porto Rlcan expedi
tion many men have deserted, the
morale of the regiment has been de
stroyed and the failure to secure ac
tive service has been charged up to
the secret efforts of Colonel Culver to
keep it from going: to the front.
It is said at the War Department
that, as a matter of fact, the Colonel
has been the victim of circumstances
over which he had no control. When
the Fifth Illinois had been ordered to
Porto Rico a delegation of Indiana peo
ple waited on the President and pre
sented the fact that although there
were three Indiana regiments fully
equipped ami ready for service, none
had been ordered to the front. It hap
pened that of three Illinois regiments
available two had been sent forward
in advance of the Fifth, so that the
department felt obliged in order to
avoid a charge of discrimination to
substitute one of the Indiana regiments
for this Illinois regiment. With this
order Colonel Culver had absolutely
nothing to do. and did not even know
that it was in contemplation.

WASHINGTON, July 28.â The French
Embassy has called the attention of the
State Department to the circumstances
connected with the seizure of the
French merchant steamship Olindo
Rodriguez,, and has requested the im
mediate release of that steamer. This
action was taken simultaneously with
a protest from the French Transat
lantic Steamship Company against the
seizure.
The State Department has submitted
all the papers In the case to the De
partment of Justice with a view to get
ting an opinion on. the legal questions
Involved. /
The grounds of the representations
made by the embassy are that the Rod
riguez was engaged in ordinary mer
cantile pursuits and also had on board
the official mail of the French Gov
ernment destined to the French Min
ister at Port au Prince. It is said
that her manifest shows she was not
intending to enter a blockaded port.
The representations are those usually
made In behalf of the French interests,
and there is no disposition at the State
Department to regard them as other
than a friendly Inquiry.

GERMAN GRAB

Emperor William Defies
Treaty Powers.
CHIEF JUSTICE POWERLESS.
AMERICAN AND ENGLISH CON
SULS UNITE IN PROTEST.
President of the Municipal Council
Detains a Royal Letter â Ger
man Officials Encourage
Native Warfare.
It is not only In the Philippines that
Emperor William Is tryinp to play his fa
vorite Teutonic frame of brap. He is
making a very strong bluff in Samoa, anÂ«l
in consequence the friction between the
representatives of the three treaty pow
â¢ rs at Apia has become excessive.
Both the English and American Con
suls are up in arms against Dr. Raff el,
the president of the municipal Council,
who is a German. Thouph appointed by
the three treaty powers Dr. Raffel seems
to consider that he represents Germany
only, and uses every means available to
irritate and annoy the English and Amer
ican residents. Fortunately the Chief
Justice, who is an American, holds a su
perior position, so that it is out of Dr.
Raffel's power to do any serious harm.
Advices from Apia, received by the
Mariposa on Wednesday, indicate the
latest phases of the difficulty. The Presi
dent has come violently into contact with
Mr. Gurr, a prominent English lawyer.
Mr. Gurr was for many years native at
torney for the Samoans, and is one of the
highest authorities on islanu affairs.
King Malietoa, who has great confidence
In Gurr, wrote him a letter on public af
fairs. Gurr lent the letter to the presi
dent and, to his intense surprise, that
gentleman refused to return it.
In vain the law/er stormed and pro
tested. The German official had got the
letter; he wanted it for state purposes;
and, rightly or wrongly, ho was going to
hang on lo it. Then Gurr took his case
to the Consuls, and the representatives
of both England and America remon
strated with their .German colleague. It
WU in vain; the president was deaf to all
appeals. He oven refused to yield to the
authority of the Chief Justice. Conse
quently there is an op>'n breach between
these officials, and strong reports have
been sent to Washington and London
condemning the German's nenavior.
To further their own ends the Germans
for some time past have been making
every effort to undermine the authority
of the Supremo Court. Judge. Chambers,
who is at its head, is a highly respected ;
American lawyer, and the Germans know |
that as long as he occupies this position ;
their underhand work will not be allowed j
to pass unnoticed.
In two actions lately brought against !
the president that official has denied the i
authority of the Supreme Court, and has
refused to come into court. This in the
face of the Berlin treaty, which express- :
ly gives the Chief Justice power to try i
matters of the kind. Judge Chambers
has declared that If the president will not
yield one or the other must leave the !
country.
Thus there is every prospect of the live
liest kind of row breaking nut in Apia.
Worst of all, the Germans have been try
ing to stir up a native war. The rebels
held a meeting recently and the majority
of the chiefs were found to be in favor
of peace and reunion with the Govern
ment; but a small section, urged on by
(Ji-rman agents, Insisted on war. The
Germans hope that a native disturbance
will give them a pretext for intervention
and possibly for the occupation of the
islands. They tried the same taettcs in
1889, but the presence of an American

BLOCKADE OF HAVANA
PROVES INEFFECTIVE
Prominent Merchant Says That Food
of All Kinds Is Plentiful in
the City.
ST. LOUIS, July 2S.â August Grupe,
one of the foremost merchants of Cuba,
who has lived in Havana for twenty
four years, stopped here to-day en
route to Germany on a visit. In an in
terview Mr. Grupe said:
"When I left Havana two weeks ago,
the inhabitants were not in the slight
est fear that the city would be bom
barded. In fact everything was going
on the same as usual. The theaters,
dancing halls and business of every
character were flourishing, and but for
the presence of troops In the city you
would never know a war was in prog
ress.
"The blockade of Havana has thus
far not proved very effective. The
farms around the city furnish all the
supplies nece-ssary. The soil is so fer
tile that crops ran be produced in thir
ty days. There is no scarcity of pro
visions in Havana, nor has there been
any perceptible advance in the price of
food. There are 40,00 regular soldiers
and 25,000 volunteers in the city. About
3000 men are working night and day
strengthening Havana's fortifications
under the personal direction of General
Blanco. A few days before I quitted the
city, the Captain General told me Hav
ana would be well-nigh Impregnable
and that talk of its fall after six
months of bombardment was sheer
nonsense."

GRAHAM ON
THE WARPATH

respondent.
HE WOULD CARVE A HEART
ENRAGED BY THE EXPOSE OF
HIS CROOKEDNESS.
Loot of the San Jose Treasury by the
School Trustee Will Probably

., , gated.
-â .-â ..
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, July 28.â Trustee Graham
did not like the article in this morning's
Call exposing his crookedness In school
affairs, and, after filling up on bad
whisky, he started out gunning for the
paper's correspondent. He failed to
find him during the day, as the corre
spondent was attending the trustees'
meeting at Agnews Asylum, and this
only added to his rage.
When Hugh Mel. Porter, the corre
spondent, called at Trustee Graham's
residence this evening to get a state
ment from him in regard to the shady
transactions Graham was in an ugly
mood. Porter had no sooner rung the
doorbell than Graham appeared. With
him was a revolver and with it he tried
to annihilate Porter. Graham placed
his hand on the gleaming handle
of the revolver in his hip pocket and
threatened to fill Porter full of holes.
He declined to make any statement
about his illegally drawing $15 a month
from the city for the rent of a school
building, under the name of J. N.
White, but really admitted such was
the fact. Graham asked for no correc
tions, but demanded blood. He said
The Call must retract the statement or
he would kili the writer on sight.
Porter saw fit to withdraw at this
time, and thus saved his body from be
ing made a sieve. Graham followed him
some twenty-five feet, giving vent at
each step to an oath and threatening
to shoot. After this episode Graham
went around town bragging of his
achievement.
The article in this morning's Call at
tracted widespread attention, and the
shady transactions of School Trustees
Graham and "Wemple will likely form
the subject of an official investigation.
KcsMes this the grand jury probably
will take up the affair. The public is
loud in denouncing the methods of the
old board and its ways of doing busi
ness will be brought to an abrupt end
before long.
Trustee T. O'Neill, a pronounced anti
gang man, and a member of the finance
committee of the new board, in speak
ing of Graham's case to-day said no
such pilfering would be tolerated by
the new board. He said that instead
of buying groceries of a harness maker
it would purchase direct from the
grocer. No trustee would be allowed to
draw money from the school fund for
the rent of a building for school pur
poses. If any trustee was illegally re
cilving money from the city O'Xeill
would see that a stop was put to it.
Burn methods as were cited in Gra
ham's case ought, he said, to oust any
member from office.

Wanderer's Second Expedition for

a Success.
NEW YORK, July 28.â A Key West
special to the Herald sa.ys: The aux
iliary boat Woodbury, Captain Rogers,
which has been on blockading duty off
the northern coaÃt of Cuba for the last
three weeks, arrived here a little be
fore sundown this evening. *She brings
Information regarding the expedition
of the steamer Wanderer, which left
here last Monday on a second attempt
to land arms and ammunition and sup
plies for the insurgents in Cuba.
After leaving Key West Monday
afternoon the Wanderer returned to
the north coast of Cuba, succeeding in
landing part of the expedition a short
distance west of Havana, in Pinar del
Rio province, near the point where she
was driven off last Saturday. The
Wanderer then went eastward and a
second landing was effected at a point
about twenty miles east of Havana.
The third expedition was landed near
Cardenas. Considerable reticence is
manifested, but from the little that can
be gathered it is evident that the Wan
derer's cargo has been successfully
landed and taken possession of by the
insurgents in Pinar del Kio, Havana
and Matanzas provinces.

ASKS FOR BUT
ONE REDUCTION
Tax Agent Ryan Before
the Equalizers.
SOUTHERN PACIFIC'S APPEAL
LINE TO SANTA CRUZ UNDEB
CONSIDERATION.
Believes the Assessment of the South
Pacific Coast Railway Should
Be Very Materially
Decreased.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, July 28.â E. Black
Ryan, Southern Pacific tax agent, ap
peared to-day before the State Board
of Equalization. The agent applied
for but one reduction, that in the case
of the South Pacific road. He said
that last year the board reduced the
assessments of the counties 10 and 15
per cent, while the railroads were as
sessed to their full ctsh value. As a
consequence the Southern Pacific Com
pany was obliged to pay additional
taxes to the amount of $45,000. He de
sired the board to take this into con
sideration in making the assessment
this year.
The tax agent asked that the South Pa
cific Coast road's assessment be reduced
from $13,000 a mile of last year to $10,000.
He claimed that this narrow-gauge road
was assessed 40 per cent over and above
other narrow-gauge roads in the State.
Equalizer Chesebrough inquired
whether Mr. Ryan had figured the
benefits his company received because of
the reduction of the county assessments.
Mr. Ryan replied that in comparison the
benefits were light. He said that in Ore
gon the company was assessed 160 per
cent less a mile than in this State. In
SiHkiyou County, adjoining Oregon, the,
road had been assessed at $17,408 a mile,
while across the line in Oregon the road
was assessed last year at $10,000 a mile.
Previous to that year the assessment av
eraged $4500 a mile, which was raised to
$10,000 on account of the action of the
board of this State. The railroad com
pany has enjoined Oregon from the col
lection of the taxes on the Increased as-
sessments.
Equalizer Bcamer paid he had been in
the county of Oregon on the line of the
road adjoining this State, and obtained
the figures of the Oregon assessment of
the road, and that he had made compari
son with the railroad assessments in
other States with that of the S<kithern
Pacific Company, and as a result he was
more than convinced that the railroads
in California had been well assessed.
Chairman Morohousp said that there
was no doubt that the California rail
roads were higher assessed than roads In
other States. In view of these facts, the
question was. TVho was rlÃht and who
was wrong? He thought the South Pa
cific Coast road was assessed too hiph on
account of the unused spurs to the Al
maden mines.
It developed that by the terms of Its
charter the Central Pacific will receive no
money from the Government for carry-
Ing the soldiers and munitions of war to
San Francisco.

SAN JOSE, July 2S.â is in the ex

AGNEWS TRUSTEES
APPLY THE BRUSH
Asylum Board Completes the White-
washing of Tourtillot and JLvs.
Madigan.
BAN JOSE. July IN.â "Not guilty"
was the verdict of the Agnews Board
of Managers to-daj- in the matter of
the charges of improper conduct pre
ferred against T. T. Tourtillott and
Mrs. Madigan.
No surprise was created by the de
termination reached, as all the proceed
ings indicated clearly what would be
the ultimate result of the investigation.
The fact was appreciated that the ma
jority of the board had relatives or
friends on the pay roll of the institu
tion, and that they wore bound to
stand together for their mutual protec
tion. While the result achieved may
be satisfactory to the judges and the
accused, it is far from freeing the pub
lic mind from the idea that the insti
tution needs a thorough weeding out
to restore a wholesome moral atmos
phere within its walls.
The proceedings partook largely of
the nature of snap Judgment. At the
list regular meeting of the Board of
Managers, Williams, who filed the
charges, was given until the next reg
ular meeting of the board in August to
prepare his case. On Monday last the
board decided to hear the charges on
Tuesday, July 26, and it was not until
about 6 o'clock Monday night that Wil
liams received notice that the matter
was to be heard the following morn
ing. This gave him little or no time
to secure the attendance of some of his
important witnesses, man, of whom
lived out of town, or were away from
their homes.
By the unexpected action of the
board in taking the matter up late
, Tuesday, after it had given out the im
pression that nothing would be done
on that day, Mr. Williams was de
prived of the services of his attorney.
He attempted to carry on the case to
the best of his ability in the face of
overwhelming disadvantages, such as
the evident hostility of a majority of
the board, the gag rulings of Chairman
Curnow and an array of numerous wit
nesses, all employes of the asylum,
Who, while they did not contradict the
principal prosecuting witness, gave tes
timony bearing on the good reputation
and character of the accused, and at
the same time endeavored, though un
successfully, to prove that Mrs. Wil
liams was not "mentally balanced."
With one exception, all the witnesses
for the defense were employes of the
asylum. The local board had been in
structed by the State commission to
instruct all witnesses who were em
ployes that they were to tell the truth
and the whole trutli in the matter un
der investigation, and that they would
be protected In their positions. This
very important preliminary was scrup
ulously omitted in every instance.
At to-day's session Williams pleaded
for more time, that he might produce
witnesses to corroborate Mrs. Williams.
He explained that yesterday his time
was taken up in court, in a battery
case, in which he was the prosecuting
witness, but the board was obdurate.
Several more witnesses were put on by
the board in behalf of the defense. The
opportunity to argue the case was curt
ly and absolutely denied Ira Wright,
the attorney for Mr. Williams. The
board went into executive session and
in three and a quarter minutes opened
the doors, announced a verdict of not
guilty, and the first a<-t in the farce
of investigating the affairs of the asy
lum by the Board of Managers was
over.
Miss Louise Rambauer, Gould's Im
portation to fill the matronship.was the
first witness to-day. She first worked at
the institution about three years ago,
remained eleven months at that time.
On November 1. lKt~, she re-entered the
institution. Miss Bambauer underwent
an examination for attendant soon after
her arrival, and in June last under
went an examination for matron. She
claimed to have ii" knowledge as to the
percentage she obtained. She was told
she had been appointed matron by the
board, and supposed she had made the
necessary percentage.
In answer to an Inquiry by Williams
as to the result of the examination for

matron, Dr. Curnow stated that Mrs.
Bambauer had received SX% per cent
and Mrs. Williams 90 per cent.
Miss Bambauer said the examination
covered a great deal of practical h<>s
i pital work, care of patients, tempera
! ture and respiration of patients. The
| examination was conducted by Dr.
Curnow, Dr. Sponogle and Dr. Hutch.
Miss Bambauer said Mrs. Williams
was peculiar. She first noticed an in
fatuation of Mrs. Williams for Tour
tlllott when she was first employed at
the asylum. She concluded Mrs. Wil
liams was peculiar from general con
duct and conversation, but principally
from the way she talked of Tourtillott.
Mrs. Williams tried in every way to
captivate Tourtillott. She was wont
to sit in front of her door, in the cor
ridor, and play on a banjo. The wit
ness said Mrs. Williams asked her if
she thought any change in her dress
would make any difference in ingratiat
ing herself in Tourtillott's good graces.
She said Mrs. Williams came to her
room at 11 nnd 12 o'clock at night to
talk about Tourtillott. Mrs. Williams
could not understand why Tourtillott
could care for Mrs. Madigan in prefer
ence to her. The witness had pointed
out to Mrs. Williams Mrs. Madigan's
charms and said she was a beautiful
woman. Mrs. Williams declared her
chances above Mrs. Madigan's and that
she would yet captivate him.
"After I came back this time," con
tinued the witness, "she was still in
fatuated with Tourtillott, and asked
me if she stood the same chances now
that Tourtillott and Mrs. Madigan were
not married. I told her I did not think
Tourtillott was in a situation where
he could marry, as he had a mother
and sister to support. Mrs. Williams
was very peculiar."
Miss Bambauer said Mrs. Williams
peculiarities were that she wanted to
be a great singer, a fine pianist and a
lawyer The witness said Mrs. "W 11
liams was mentally unbalanced, but
not as crazy as some of the persons
committed. The fact that Mrs. Wil
liams had excelled the witness at ex
amination. Miss Bambauer declared,
had nothing to do with the opinion
"he had formed of Mrs. Williams be
ing queer. There were some patients
locked up who probably could have ex
celled her at the examination. Mrs.
Williams' dress and speech and the
fact that her mind roamed from one
subject to another were other peculiar
ities She often came downstairs in a
tea' gown and sat around in the office.
Mrs. Williams was very kind to the
patients. Â ,
Charles L.. Williams was recalled.
His testimony was along the same lines
â¢is' that given on Tuesday. He com
plained he had not been given sufficient

Miss Ella Boyse. Mrs. M. D. Chaplain.
I H de SaJlier and Mr. Berry as wit
nesses Hale asked Williams if it was
not a fact The Call was urging him on
in this matter and supplying the wit
nesses Williams said it was not so.
Hale then attempted to show that The
Call was active in the investigation.
L Seidenberg asked to be heard at
this point, and declared The Call was
not any more active in this case than
in others where it was to the interest
of the people of the State to havo the
truth brought out.
Isaac Thompson of Santa Clara was
present. Some statements accredited
to Thompson, to the effect that he had
said Williams was not getting a fair
deal before the board were repeated by
Williams. An attempt was made to
get Thompson on the stand, but before
he cmild be summoned he started for
home. __,
Williams said he never went to De
tective Frost's (fflce with charges
against Sponorle. Frost told him that
he had looked up the record of Spon
ogle, Gould and the Governor and he
was going to wheelbarrow them all out
to a dump and throw them over. He
told Williams that he and his wife had
some evidence that he needed.
Williams then produced his marriage

Dr. Stocking had heard rumors of
scandal under Investigation. Had also
read of them in the papers. He testi
fied t'Â» the truthfulness and honesty of
Mrs. Madigan and Tourtillott. The wit
ness also gave Mrs. Williams a good,
reputation.
John Angus, an usher, had seen Mrs.
Williams sitting on a box in the base
ment conversing with M. Festl, an ar
tist, but now an inmate of the institu
tion. The patient was not a violent
one, but lie did not think any respect
able young lady would do such a thing.
They were looking at pictures. The
demented artist painted some pictures
of a nude order, but he could not say
these were the ones they were looking
at. He regarded Mrs. Williams as
queer. She was not very modest, and
often came to the door In her night
dress.
Dr. Christal denied that in a conver
sation on Tuesday evening he had told
Williams to go on with the case and
that he urged him to do so.
This closed the testimony, and an ad
journment was taken until after lunch.
Wh.-n they reassembled it was to de
cide the matter. An executive session
was gone into, and a few minutes later
Chairman Curnow announced a ver
dict.
The three directors found unani
mously that Mrs. Madigan and Tourtil
lott were not guilty as charged.
ASYLUM INMATES WITH
MONEY AND REAL ESTATE
SAN JOSE, July 27.â While the State
Lunacy Commission is in session at
Agnews, Its secretary, John F. Carriere,
is looking over the personal effects of
the patients in the institution. When
inmates are brought in all articles are
taken from them and pigeon-holed.
Since the founding of the institution
no efforts have been made to take care
of thia property. The law creating the
lunacy commission made this part of
its duty. An investigation during the
last two days shows that many of the
insane have sums of money in bank
and real estate. The law provides that
those who are able shall pay and the
money thus realized shall go for this
purpose.
Last evening Secretary Carriere dis
covered about $3000 worth of effects be
longing to patients. William E. Chan
der, an inmate, had drafts on a French
bank railing for 1100 francs. Annie Ol-
Ben had a certificate of deposit for $418
and in another instance a deed to 177
acres of land near a town in Texas
was discovered.

months in an attempt to get to the Klon
rtiKe over the Ashcroft route. He was ac

fore they had penetrated 100 miles intp
the Interior.
Atkinson says they met with incredible

made lor Fort Simpson five hundred thor
oughly dispirited men were simply starv

interminable forest, and Atkinson says if
help does not reach them soon human
skeletons on the trail will outnumber
those of the cattle and horses already
lost. Most of the men have lost their
outfits, or, becoming stalled, have eaten
all their provisions. They are described
as a gaunt, hunger-stricken and desperato
band of men. with no hope of getting
through to Klondike and only a small
hope of being able to return to civiliza

company by the city. The company holds
that it is to continue in possession of its
property until it is naid in full for it.
This misunderstanding may have the ef

LIKE A SHELL
AND PEA GAME
How the Talent Fares
at Sausalito.
POLL-SELLING SOAPY SMITHS
BRACE GAME ILLUSTRATED BY
FIGURES.
Why It Is That Speculators Who
Cross the Bay to "Play the
Ponies'' Sometimes Have
to Swim Back.
- "Soapy" Smith, late of Skaguay, was
a robber, a gambler and a cut-throat â
peace to his ashes. Hut "Soapy" had
the decency to die in good season with
bis hoots on, likt? a gentleman; and
the reports that he already has made
the Farmer Corntassels of the happy
huntinp grounds regret his coming may
have been s<Mit out by Examiner-Jour
nal commissioners and should be dis
credited until fully verified.
"Soapy" was not altogether bad at
heart. He had been known to hand
out to a less fortunate fellow man the
entire profits derived but a short time
previous by knocking some Reuben on
the. head and ravaging his pockets.
Like Grayback Pete of Arizona, he
generally gave his intended victims a
run for their money. Grayback Pete,
be it known, was the leader of a band
of free-lances around Tombstone in the
good old days, when a man never car
ried a kerchief, because that would
have branded him a dude, and for the
further reason that to have reached
Into a n-ar pocket for one would have
Started some overcautious gent's flre
arxns to exploding. Pete had been
accused of having murdered Just for
pastime the men he took prisoners.
This impeachment he invariably de
nied, declaring that he never killed a
man without giving him a chance.
"Wen 'le gang decides a mug's got
to croak," he explained, "I give 'im de
chance to light me an' see wether
he chucks it up or is turned loose. We
fights over a rope. De gang stands
dt-re to shoot the duck 'at tries to jump
over de rope."
"What kind of weapons do you use?"
fa was asked one day.
"Well," he responded, "I ginerally
uses a rifle or a small barker and
"tother fellow a knife."
Sausalito, the pretty village whose
proprietor and moral director, Senor
Sylva, permits it to lie just across the
bay from San Francisco, has its
"Soapy" Smiths and its Grayback
Petes, but no one ever accused them of
returning any contributions found in the
kitty. The names by which they are
known to the police and society are
Harrison and Harvey, but the titles ap
plied to them by speculators who cross
the bay with capital, go up against
their brace game and then have to
swim to get back are not fit for pub
lication in a respectable family journal.
This pair of worthies operate the pool
piums, which, by the grace of Chris
topher Buckley and a little metallic
suasion exerted upon the municipal of
ficers, are permitted to exist in the
erstwhile respectable town. This in
itself Is not a crime â merely an offense;
but when the game they conduct de
velops from one of chance to one of
no chance at all: like that of the man
who .sells the bar of soap around which
he doesn't wrap the greenback, they
deserve the usual fate of convicted
three-card monte artists and gold-brick
s-alesmen.
At best the racing game is a hard â¢
one for the speculator to beat. The
â¢ percentage against him is enormous.
In the pool rooms it is more so. The
Qdds offered at the track are "boiled
down" until the man who tries to
"beat the ponies" by the long-distance
method has to sell his clothes to keep f
up with the percentage against him.
This is easily illustrated by means
of facts and figures. In the follow- â¢
Ing table are given the names of the
horses that finished "in the money" on
Wednesday at Brighton Beach, with
the odds offered at the track and those
posted in Harrison's and Harvey's pool â

At Harlem the winning horses and
the prices were:

Frlnr John 6 to 1 6 to 1
Kentucky. Colonel 11 to .'i 2 to 1
Lu.ille Brnmble 4 to 5 4 to a
Koncliffe 7 to 2 3 to 1
From the foregoing it will be seen
that in only two instances were the
Sausallto odA better than the average
at the track, and in these the increase
was trifling. The favored horses were
Lord Neville and Pinochle. Aside from
these exceptions, in almost every in
stance the odds were "shaved." On
long-priced horses the reduction was
generally 50 per cent; on those better
liked by the talent it ran from 15 to
40 per cent.
When Eddie Jones landed Leo Lake
a winner in the first race at Brighton
Beach his backers, who, instead of
herding in a crowded, smoke-befouled
room to hear the telegraph operator
monotonously call off the positions of
the horses in the race as they were
ticked off by his instrument, were com
fortably ensconced in the open air, with
beautiful surroundings and an exhilar
ating view of the actual contest of
speed, drew down S2O for each $1 they
turned in to the "bookies." The un
fortunates who are growing "poolroom
faces" across the bay got but half as
muchâ that Is, if they were lucky
enough or shrewd enough to have had
a bet on Leo Lake.
Now the regulars knowâ or ought to
knowâ that at the best the percentage
is always on the side of the book
maker. Occasionally, they may corner
a Barney Schreiberâ sometimes called
a Dutchâ by playing the several horses
in different books, in cases where cer
tain bookmakers are laying against
certain horses. But the individual
layer of odds is seldom caught napping.
The best of the argument is always the
one he advances.
To begin with, the bookmaker on a
middle Western or California track
starts the day $150 loser, that sum rep
resenting the amount he pays the track
management and the salaries of his
crew. This he has to recover on the
five or six races carded for the day,
and, as he usually is a thrifty fellow,
he takes home a trifle besides. If he
makes book on a strict percentage
basis, he is a certain winner if the play
is reasonably heavy. There is no ele
ment of chance about his end of the
transaction when taking in the coin
of the bettor. Elie Perles, who is said
to juggle with figures as a monkey does
with a cocoanut, has been known to
work out his percentages with such
nicety that at the end of the day the
amount of profit was within five or six
mills of what it ought to have bet-n
were the man on the block striving to
win only a certain percentage. Many
of the bookmakers gamble frequently
themselves, by laying against certain
horses and taking all the money they
can get, or by holding out others, losing
if their choice loses. This gives the
track bettors an advantage over their
poolroom fellows, for they profit when
a bookmaker "hunches the price,"
while, the poolroom operator never
"hunches" anything except the credul
ity of the lambs whose fleece is des
tined to become "his'n."
The poolroom "Soapy" Smith pays to
the telegraph company $20 a day for
each track from which the results are
received, and his other expenses
amount to $50 or $60 a day, making the
total something over $100, not includ
ing side issues in the way of itching of
ficial palms that have to be scratched.
The figures of the latter item are sel
dom made public. All told, his ex
penses are certainly less than those of
the sellers at the race track; and yet
he finds it necessary to reduce from 10
to 50 per cent the odds offered by the
man at the course before the profits are
sufficiently large to satisfy his thrift.
He is not content to lay average track
prices, minus the occasional upward
fluctuations which in the betting ring
cause speculators to lose their dignity
and scramble like women at a bargain
counter. He is not averse to making
a 25 per cent book, and has been known
to levy 50 per cent, paying out but $10
for every $20 wagered with him. When
it is known that the patronage of each
of the Sausalito rooms is at least equal
to that of individual bookmakers at
the racetrack the extent of their pro
fits may be surmised. Verily, the pool
room game is like that of the shells and
the pea: when the farmer looks for his
returns they are not there.
The poolroom proprietor is a humor
ist and has a little joke of his own that
h'_- springs before each race. In one
column on his board he marks the odds
as they come by telegraph, and in an
other column he posts those he offers,
the latter bein^ a slight advance over
the former, which are styled the "track
odds." Whether it is expected that
this really deceives his patrons Is a
matter of conjecture. As a matter of
fact the odds telegraphed from the
track are always reduced from 15 to 50
per cent, and sometimes more from
those actually offered by track book
makers. This is apparent when it is
considered that even after elevating
the figures, the poolroom three-shell
man Is away under legitimate prices.
In its sporting column The Call each
morning hereafter will give the figures
posted against the placed horses at the
leading tracks, and if the object lesson
leads one forlorn speculator to see the
error of his ways and cease contribut
ing his tithe to the wolves and the
jackals of SausalMo, its labor will not
have been In vain.

SLOAN AND CHEVALIER.
Nick S. Hall's Canace, a Napa-Bred
Tilly, Second in a Fast-Run
Race at Washington
Park, Chicago.
The racing strings ctf the Messrs. Boots
of Milpitas and Sam Hildreth of Ingleside.
are now quartered a.^ Saratoga Springs,
N. Y. Racing began yesterday at the
glorious Spa of the Empire State, and
among the starters we noted Twinkler of
the former lot and Hurly Burly from the
Hildreth stable. The latter is regarded as
nearly the champion sprinter of the mid
dle Westâ at least she divides the honors
with Mary Black, the Californian.
In the list of mares recently purchased
by General W. H. Jackson of Belle Meade
we noticed California, once a very speedy
race mare and one that won stakes for
Tully Coulter both at Oakland and
around Chicago. She recently broke down
and was sold for a brood mare for about
$1500. Diggs, who created a sensation as ]
a two-year-old by running six furlongs in
1:12%, and who defeated the best gallop
ers in training at Harlem that summer,
passed under the hammer at the same
sale for $250. He is an own brother to
Sutton and Olinthus. The latter was,
next to Formero, the best two-year-old ,
colt in California last spring, winning
four stake races for Galen Brown and '
Irving Diggs, his breeder. Mr. Diggs lives
in Woodland. This season he mated
Lily Wright, the dam of Diggs, Sutton,
Ulinthus, et al., with the renowned sire,
Imp. Brutus.
Sombre, the black daughter of imp.
Midlothian, and the. former turf queen,
Miss Woodford, was disgracefully beaten
at Brighton Beach yesterday, finishing
last in a four-horse race. Backed down
from even money to 7 to 10, she led for a
little over three furlongs, then "blew
up," even the skatish Dr. Fitzsimmons tin
ishing in front of the filly mat was ex
pected to set the Easterners afire with
enthusiasm. Last . spring Sombre broke
the Ingleside track record for four and a
half furlongs and carried 118 pounds into
the bargain. Olinthus and a.i the other
two-year-old cracks had to take her dust.
However, Sombre is not larger than the
proverbial "pint of cider." tipping the
scales at less tuan 700 pounds. >
The champion horse riding midget. Tod
Sloan, will appear in the pigskin at the j
Saratoga meeting. He rode only a couple
of times at Brighton, which was too pie- !
beian for "his ludship." The Eastern pa- j
pers are devoting a great deal of space |
in discussing the origin of Tod's method
of piloting race horses, and seem to be
agreed that he stole his plans and Specifi
cations from "Snapper" Garrison. They
are all wrong. The chances are Sloan
never saw "the Snapper" ride half a j
dozen races in his life, but he did observe
little coffee-colored Chevalier "put many a !
winner over the plate, and that's where
"the hunch" originated. Chevalier was i
lithe and active, and when the wind was :
booming off the bosom of the broad Pa- I
cific, blowing the sand around Bay Dis- i
trict track in blinding sheets, the little
pickaninny would be out on the larboard
side of his mount's neck, riding for dear
life and offering as little resistance to the
wind as possible, and when the horse
would get into the homestretch Hippo
lyte's face would be in # close proximity to
the galloper's ears. '
At the time of which we speak Cheva
lier was putting winners over the plate
in a way that harrowed up the proud
and jealous spirit of "Captain Tod," and
that he gave the whys and wherefores
and the whichnoss of Chevy's success due
consideration there can be no gainsay
ing. That he v would now scoff at any
one if they were to even hint that ' he
ran away with a coon's ideas anent rid
ing racers is also pretty certain, but a
comparison of the style of the pair Jn I
the saddle will at once lead one to be
lieve that there is at any rate a wonder
ful similarity. â  Furthermore, Tod's rid
ing up to two and a half years ago would
not set the bay afire, and it is about that
length of time since the midget man
changed bis style. And now Danny Ma
her, they say. Is patterning after Tod.
Nick S. Hall's Crelgh ton filly Canace,
bred by A. B. Spreckels, ran second to
Batten in a fast race at Harlem yester
day.
Weenatchle, twice a winner at St. Louis
within a week, la by the unbeaten El Rio
Rey,,from Question, by Jog Hooker.
The special commissioner- of the London
Sportsman say: "In an Interesting conversa
tion which I had with Mr. Lorillard. he fully
agreed as to the palpable excellence of New
haven II and exactly expressed my own Ideas
as to climatic Influences in the breeding of race
horses. 'No fanner,' said he, 'would dream of
growing wheat year after year from seed raised
on the same land, and it Is the same with pota
toes or any other products of the soil. You
j want climatic change In these things, and so It
is with horses. You do right to bring Austral
lan horses here. They are sure to improve your
stock.' I have not the slightest doubt that it is
change of climate which makes a horse that
has been a stud failure In England succeed
when he goes to America, or elsewhere, and, as
I have often paid, if the Duke of Westminster
would give old Tien dOr a chance he would
even yet sire a second Ormonde."
There was strong talk lately of a match
race between the California filly Tolucn,
and Spirituolle, a daughter of Spokane
which Hildreth's filly had defeated.
Lucky Star, the clinking good son of
imp. Friar Tuck and Keepsake, recently
passed into the hands of a Montana turf
man, and the price was reported at $1600.
He's a cheap horse at that figure.
! Marcus Daly, at Butte, Mont., recently
sold off a number of horses in training,
two and three years old, mostly. Very
fair prices were realized, animals going
at $1250. $1100, 1900 and $750. Ffank Van
Ness of this city was quite a buyer at
the sale. ;

of Young's guilt, as he was Issued only
five days' rations at a time and these
he was obliged to immediately issue to
the companies of the regiment.
Young, in his confession, dissipated
their doubts by explaining that he has
i been issuing short weight rations and
| also by making requisition upon the
commissary depot for more stores than
he was rightfully entitled to.
Young was first suspected of wrong
doing on June 2, when the ladles of
the Red Cross discovered that he was
selling tobacco placed in his hands for
free distribution among the troops.
Since that date Colonel Funston and
the brigade commissary have kept
careful account of all of his business
transactions, with the result that they
have amassed evidence enough to con
vict him at his first hearing.
Young's case will be heard by the
court-martial now in session.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JULY 29, 1898.
WILL GO TO MANILA.
The Seventh California Will Sail
for the Philippines in the \
Next Transport.
Yesterday afternoon Major General Merrlam announced at mili
tary headquarters that the next regiment to be sent to Manila will
be the Seventh California, in command of Colonel Berry. This reg
iment will sail either on the Arizona or Scandia inside of ten days.
This announcement explains the order from headquarters directing
the Seventh not to move from Camp Merrltt to the Presidio, the
time of the regiment's departure being so near at hand that the re
moval would cause unnecessary trouble. Besides the regiment pre
fers to stay at Camp Merritt until sailing day.
The Seventh California ranked among the very first of the National
Guard organizations in the United States. Such was the verdict of
officers of the United States regular army after all points had been
thoroughly considered in Washington.
The regiment is made up largely of the very best material from
Los Angeles, Pasadena, Riverside, San Diego, San Bernardino, Red
lands and other towns and communities in the southern part of the
State. From the very day the men were mustered into the volunteer
service they have been anxious to be sent to the front, and expected
to have been at Manila long ago. They became impatient at times
at their inactivity and frequently expressed the opinion that they
were being intentionally overlooked. Time and again they had their
hopes raised only to be disappointed. The announcement that they
are now to go to Manila on the next transport is indeed welcome
news, even if it does come a little late in the day. Nevertheless the
boys, if opportunity offers, will give a good account of themselves in
the Philippines.
nues. Market and East streets. They
wore given a royal send off all along the
line.
Arrived at the dock. Colonel Stover
found more -work ahead of him than he
had expected. At the last moment 140
tons of Government freight, consisting of
white uniforms for the troops now at
Manila, was unloaded at the dock, and
had to be stowed away before the camp
equipment could be loaded.
Colonel Stover managed matters so that
no confusion resulted, though the St. Paul
went into the stream with a pretty
heavy deck load.
The battalion mascot, a goat of canny
propensities, was boxed up and sent
aboard, labeled "carrier pigeons." That
goat was the pride of Watertown, S. D.,
and had to go If the regiment did.
The troops did not go on hoard the St.
Pnul until G o'clock In the afternoon,
owing to some work that had to be done
in order to afford better ventilation in
the forward hold. Meantime the boys re
mained on the wharf. At about 6 o'clock
they were all on board and the steamer
th.-n pulled out Into the stream, being
saluted by the usual chorus of steam
whistles. The steamer McDowell will
carry the mails and final instructions to
the St. Paul at 0 o'clock this morning, and
the transport will sail as soon thereafter
as possible.
She will be in command of Colonel T.
H. Barber of the First New York Regi
ment as far as Honolulu and from that
port to Manila she will be in charge of
Lieutenant Colonel Lee Stover of the
First South Dakota.
THE PRESIDIO CA.MP.
Evtiyt'iing Ready on the Res
ervation to Accommodate
the Fifty-First lowa.
The now ramps at the Presidio for the j
troops from Camp Merrltt have been pre
pared. The pipes that are to supply the
water have been laid and the necessary j
sinks have been dug, and it is expected j
that the removal of the soldiers from the
camp where they have been already too
loiiK to their new and better encamp
ment will begin to-day, when the Fifty
flrst lowa Regiment will move from Camp
Mt-rritt to the Tresidio.
The departure of Colonel Barber of the
First New York Regiment leaves Lieuten
ant Colonel Stacpole in command. There
seems to be no doubt that if Colonel Bar
ber is made a brigadier general. Colonel
Btacpole will succeed him in command of
tii<- regiment. Captain F. J. H. Klekon,
Company L. Corps ot Kngineers, is in
command of the battalion in the absence
of Major Langlitt. who has gone to Hono
lulu on the St. PauL
There were 22VÂ» new cases In the division
field hospital yesterday. The following
deaths occurred yesterday: Alfred C.
Beff, Company F, Fifty-first lowa, died
at 1 o'clock in the afternoon, of pneumo
nia, and Private William Marske, Com
pany G, Seventh California Regiment,
died at 3:30 o'clock, of spinal meningitis.
Both deaths occurred in the division hos
pital. There were no deaths in the post
hospital, and none of the soldiers confined
therr are considered in any danger.
The Wyoming (Algen Light Battery
has received its new guns, and the men
are now doubly anxious to be given a
chance to go to the front and show what
they can do. The new battery consists of
four 3.2-inch breech-loading rifles, known
as the "three decimal" guns, with the
necessary wagons and ammunition.
John Dale, a private In Company H,
First South Dakota Volunteers, died at
the Marine Hospital yesterday. Dale was
cleaning his rifle on July 10, when it ac
cidentally went off, the ball lodging in
his right breast. Dr. Gassaway reported
the. case to the Coroner's office, but as
the. deceased had been under a surgeon's
care and died on a United States reserva
tion, the Coroner replied that it was out
of his jurisdiction.
Privates Joseph H. Knapp, Company G,
Mosea Pritchard and Bert A. Metcalf,
Company L, Fourteenth Infantry, now in
the division field hospital at the Presidio,
have been assigned to temporary duty
with the Third Battalion of the Eigh
teenth Infantry, and will accompany that
battalion to Manila.
Captain C. B. Thompson, quartermaster
at the Presidio, has been ordered to In
voice to Major Francis Jones, depot quar
termaster at Manila, the following prop
erty for shipment on the sailing ship to
the" Philippines: One hundred and twenty
mules. W cavalry horses, 30 escort wag
ons and fourteen Red Cross ambulances,
with all equipment and extra parts per
taining thereto.
PHYSICAL DISABILITY.
Recruits That Should Not Have
Been Accepted Will Be Mus-
tered Out of Service.
It has come to be a notorious fact that
many recruits that were mustered into
the volunteer rnnkÃ of the troops now
stationed at Camp Merritt were physical
ly unlit for service at the time of their
first examination. The hardships of camp
life together with the heavy work of
drilling have mercilessly shown up the
weak ones, and during the past mf.ith
they have been dropped from the ranks
by the dozen.
It has been discovered that six of the
cases reported arc sufferers from chronic
hip disease, others from consumption,
rheumatism, heart disease and a dozen
other disqualifying maladies. The ac
ceptance of such men is considered little
less than criminal by the regular army
officers at camp. In order to eliminate
from the ranks the physically undesir
able, the following order was issued yes
terday from General Miller's headquar
ters:

PIE BITERS ABROAD.
Soldiers Raid a Baker Wagon
and Use Pastry as Deadly
Weapons.
William Weber, who conducts a bakery
establishment and pie factory at 32 Sixth
street, complains to The Call that his
S7Â£.gon, containing bread, cakes, pies and
-C ughnuts to the value of $60 or $7(>, was
raided yesterday morning at Camp Mer
ritt by Colorado and Minnesota recruits.
Mr. AVeber says that the soldiers "de
molished the wagon all to pieces,"
knocked the stuffing out of his pies, and
that he was himself roughly handled.
His lit lie boy set up a great outcry,
whereupon one of the soldiers smashed a
pie on the youngster's het.l.. almost frac
turing the skull. The itiid occurred in
the presence of one army oulcer and two
police officers.
To-day the outraged baker will submit
all the facts of the raid to Major Genera.:
Merrlam, commanding the Department of
California, being confident that the gei:
eral's sense of justice is so strong that he
will make an example of the leaders of
the raid. This irrepressible desire of the
volunteers for pie proves conclusively
that the ladies of the Red Cross Society
knew what was wanted for the army
when the campaign opened.
A DESERVED PROMOTION.
Lieutenant Colonel W. A. Bald-
win, Purchasing Agent, Goes
Up Another Step.
The genial countenance of Lieutenant
Colonel William A. Baldwin, commissary
of subsistence, United States army, and
purchasing commissary of subsistence at
San Francisco, wore an usually happy
smile yesterday. It was caused by a tele
graphic notilication of his promotion to
the rank of colonel.
. Colonel ' Baldwin has been stationed In
San Francisco for : several years in his
present' capacity,' and has invariably, per
formed his duties â¢ .with : marked ability.
This Is particularly true of his work dur
ing the present war. Since the breaking
out of hostilities he has made many large
purchases, involving immense sums of
money. In, all these transactions he has
shown that he, possesses business aualill
cations far above the ordinary. His pro
motion is a deserved recognition of his
ability. \
Colonel Baldwin, who was born in Penn
sylvania, graduated from the Military
Academy at West Point in 1877, and was
assigned to duty as second lieutenant in
the Seventh Cavalry, of which regiment
he was the quartermaster from April 9,
1880, to November 1, ISBI.

NOVEL MILITARY DRILL.
To Be Performed by the Fifty-
First lowa Regiment in
Mechanics' Pavilion.
The drill of the Fifty-first lowa Regi
ment announced for to-morrow evening
promises to be one of the most novel and
Interesting entertainments that has been
given in San Francisco for some time.
The lowa troops gave an exhibition in
Mechanics' Pavilion four weeks ago, and
the success then attained by their com
panies and band has induced the mem
bers of Lincoln Post, Woman's Relief
Corps, which is giving the entertainment
to-morrow evening, to secure the appear
ance of the same regiment.
As a unique feature. Colonel Loper has
decided to give something as nearly ap
proximating a sham battle as the size of
the Pavilion will permitâ an attack on a
camp guard by a' body of advancing
troops. A company of men will march
upon the Pavilion floor, erect tents and
retire therein for the night. Fhe guard
on patrol will be attacked by a hostile
force and a lively skirmish will ensue.
Following the drill will be a promenade
concert and dance until midnight, the
lowa band furnishing the music.
The admission will De 25 cents; reserved
seats, 50 cents, at Sherman & Clay's.
Soldiers Entertaind.
Colonel and Mrs. Harry Mortimer, 2030
Pierce street, have been unremitting in
their hospitality to the volunteers at
Camp Merrltt and the Presidio. At least
once a week since the troops began to
arrive in San Francisco a dinner party
haa been given to the young soldiers. The

â WEINHOLD DEFEATED.
Night Attack on His Saloon
Near Camp Merritt by Sol-
diers and Civilians.
Melnheer Welnhold, the originator and
largest manufacturer of five-cent whisky
at Camp Merrltt, has pulled his tent pegs
and gone no one knows whither.
For a time he and his five-cent inno
vation flourished and he suffered nothing
but the ill will of his neighboring com
petitors, but on Tuesday he added to his
vvhisky sign an announcement that "two
sharp steams" could be had Inside for a
nickel. This meant war to the faucet.
At an enrly hour yesterday morning a
couple of Weinhold's most energetic com
netltora augmented by a dozen sympa
thetic and debtor soldiers, began opera
tions on the front of Wtlnhold's saloon.
Bricks bottles and what not burst in his
windows and sprung his doors and in a
very few moments the remains of the
joint were so badly mutilated that iden
tification was an impossibility.
Weinhold did hi* best to repel the as
sault. Armed with a couple of revolvers
he charged to the front and lired wildly
through space a half dozen shots that
had no more effect than to call put the
Kansas guard. The only effect that the
fusillade had upon the assaulting party
was to call forth more bricks; the defeat
ed Welnhold retired to the rear.
Yesterday afternoon the sign of the s

of the belligerents, leaving white-winged
peace to take his place.
The Kansas Boys to Entertain.
The drill at Mechanics' Pavilion next
Thursday evening, the 4th of August, will
without question be one of the most en
joyable yet given, as the Twentieth Kan
sas Regiment and officers are making
special preparation for the occasion, and
there is quite an interest being manifested
in the interior towns. It is expected there
will be excursions from Sacramento,
Stockton, San Jose and other cities. The
Southern Pacific Company has signified
its intention of offering special rates. A
band concert and living pyramid of Hags
will be among the interesting features of
the evening. The good work ueing car
ried forward by the A.rmy and Navy
Christian Commission merits a liberal
patronage. Over fifty ladies were engaged
in sewing for the men last Tuesday, and
will be at the various tents of the com
mission again to-day for tne same pur
pose. Receipts for work of the commis

METHODS Of THE VENERABLE
CHIEF.
THE Call is In receipt oi the following letter
under date of July 26: "Why did not Chief
Lees treat Figel as he has treated Lochner? If
U am not mistaken, he said he would not take the
responsibility of arresting Figel on suspicion. He
ted some one to put the charge against him.
Has Lochner equal rights with Figel, or did Figel
Tiave a pull? Kindly retrain from using my name
if you print this, as I do not want to be arrested
on suspicion, and desire no Spanish rules applied
to me.''
These questions verge upon the line of delicacy.
They cannot be answered without danger of arous
ing the wrath of Chief Lees, and the Chief in anger
is terrible to behold. Still, we will venture a reply,
:ng the inquirer that if it fail to be satisfac
tory he is at liberty to repeat the questions to the
Chief in person.
Technically, Figel and Lochner stand on the same
plane before the law. But when Lees gets through
truing the law, they don't. They were each
accused of the crime of murder. It is fair to say
that the apparent evidence against Figel was stronger
than that against Lochner, as in the latter case there
was never more than a vague speculation of possi
ble guilt. But Figel had friends, and could com
mand money. Lochner had no friends and no as
sets worth mentioning. These circumstances con
stitute what the correspondent is pleased to term a
pull.
When Lees takes a notion to put a man in jail, Ire
6imply puts him there. The statutes specify the
necessity for a warrant, but the statute to which Lees
cannot rise superior has yet to get on the books.
Lees had no right to put Lochner in jail, no right
to detain him, and the proceeding from the first
wr.s an outrage. The system practiced by Lees of
placing men in the "tanks" is wholly illegal, but the
victims of it are many. Lochner was one of these,
lie had no pull. It is a serious error to get sus
jjcc'ted of any crime without first getting the pulL
IMPORTANCE OF THE STATE FAIR.
THE yearly State Fair is always of importance
as a showing of the material advancement oi
California, an object lesson of its resources, a
stimulus to its industries, and a broadening of its
markets. But this season it is of far more than or
dinary importance. The Board of Agriculture is to
be commended for the efforts that have been made to
insure success, and deserves encouragement to the ut
most,
It must not be forgotten that the State has passed
through the worst year in all its experience as a pro
ducing commonwealth. The rainfall has been so
small as to work havoc with crops of every sort. In
a le*s enterprising community, or one in which the
inherent wealth was not extraordinary, such a year
would have killed the annual fair. Here it has
aroused an ambition to make the fair great, com
plete and impressive. Despite the drought there
have been crops of grain and fruits, and attention
â¢should be paid to having a fine display in these and
other lines. California must demonstrate that it rises
superior to an adverse stroke such as would have
blighted another region. Livestock has suffered
greatly, and some ranges will have to be restocked.
Therefore growers who have fine animals to dispose
of will be wise to place them on exhibition. There
â¢will be a demand for them.
California as never before is in the public atten
tion. The war has given it prominence, and its
name is on the lips of many who never had thought
definitely of it, and to whom it had been simply a
part of the Great West. The stranger is within our
gates. He has heard stories of the harm wrought by
the paucity of rainfall. The fact must be demon
strated to him that the State is too big, too rich and
too energetic to be in any measure crushed by a
single misfortune. The success of the fair will mean
much. It will do away with a false impression, and
Ju?t now, when new commercial standing is being at
tained, it becomes necessary to place products of
every variety on exhibition. Let us have this year
a better fair than yet held. Both pride and policy
demand this. It can be done, and happily there is
every. prospect that it will be done.
Apparently the Spanish would welcome peace if the
United States would return all that has been taken,
accompanying it by an apology for rudeness.
One interesting phase of the clash between General
'Merritt and Captain Whiting is that in all proba
bility it never occurred.
There is scant recognition of the utility of having
powder works in thickly populated districts. The un
dertakers seem to have a pull.
At El Caney the price of a tin of condensed milk is
said to be $25, and people of moderate circumstances
use it sparingly. - ,
AN HISTORICAL INQUIRY.
NINETEEN years ago on the 3d day of Septem
ber next the Republican party of California
elected its candidate for Governor. The name
of the fortunate gentleman was Perkins. He came
originally from Butte County, but at the time of his
nomination was a resident of this city. Mr. Perkins,
however,* was not chosen Governor by a majority of
the votes cast. He had two opponents, Glenn (Dem
ocrat) and White (Workingman). The combined
vote of these two candidates exceeded the vote cast
for the Republican nominee by several thousand. In
'< fact, Perkins was elected Governor by a beggarly
! plurality, which, had the Democrats and Working
' men combined â something they came near doing â
j might have been easily swept away.
Since the 3d day of September, 1879, when Mr.
Perkins triumphantly won the governorship over a
divided and disgruntled Democracy, the Republicans
of California have succeeded in projecting just one
other man into the executive mansion at Sacramento.
This gentleman's name was Markham. He origin
ated in Michigan, we believe, but at the time of his
election hailed from Los Angeles. Mr. Markham
was chosen by a majority of about 7000, notwith
standing that Senator Stanford ran at the same elec
tion and obtained an aggregate majority on the Leg
islative ticket of 40,000. A gentleman named Pond,
a resident of this city, opposed the aspirations of Mr.
Markham. This accounted for the poor showing
made by the latter. Pond went 10,000 votes ahead of
his ticket, and, had the Australian ballot been then in
vogue, would undoubtedly have beaten Markham by
a substantial majority. But in 1890 the bosses were
still able by means of a printed list of nominees to
more or less direct the political expressions of the
people.
This is a somewhat astonishing record, especially
when it is considered that every gubernatorial year
since 1879, with a single exception (1882) has been
a Republican "yellow dog" year. In 1886 the Re
publican convention at Los Angeles was asked to
nominate Chancellor Hartson for Governor. Hart
son was an independent, anti-corporation man from
Napa. The railroad monopoly, Bill Higgins, Henry
Vrooman and Steve Gage, preferred Swift. Washing
ton Bartlett, Mayor of San Francisco, defeated Swift
by 600 votes, though the Republican candidate for
Lieutenant Governor was elected and subsequently
became Governor in consequence of Bartlett's death.
In 1894 the Republican convention at Sacramento
was asked to discover and nominate an independent,
anti-corporation candidate for Governor. But the
bosses, the political machinists and the corporations
preferred Estee. He was beaten by a plurality of
1200. Estee ran behind his ticket in every county in
the State and lost San Francisco by 12,000 majority.
What does all this signify? Does it signify that in
this "yellow dog" year of 1898 it is going to be safe
for the Republicans to place before the people a
canine gubernatorial candidate acceptable to the
bosses, the corporations, the political machines and
1 the railroad? That character of candidate has been
tried now for nineteen years, and the Democrats have
won three out of four times. They havi won under
â  the old ballot system, and they are winning under the
j new. While the Republicans are nominating "yel
i low dogs" and going down to defeat with them, the
; Democrats are winning by the simple expedient of
! placing at the head of their tickets independent, pop
ular, anti-corporation men. What is the situation
this year? The Democracy is about to nominate the
most adroit politician they haye â an able lawyer, a
hard campaigner, a cunning demagogue and a
"tribune" of the people.
The burning question is. Can the Republican party
defeat this man with a "yellow dog?" Is this a
time when the claims of country politicians, faction
ists, machine men and railroad hacks should be con
sidered? Is this a time when the aspirations of per
renial candidates for Senators who want to make
"combinations" for the destruction of everybody ex
cept themselves should be promoted? Is this a time
when "harmony" should be purchased by bartering
the party to its bosses, its machines, and the Southern
Pacific monopoly?
These questions are Important and should be an
swered. In our judgment there is but one way in
which the Republican party can ever again secure
control of the State of California. It must cease
"programming" and begin nominating popular can-
didates â candidates in whom the masses have confi
dence. The people must be let into the party coun
cils. The Australian ballot ha 9 abolished "yellow
dogs" and political bosses. Nominations no longer
mean elections. No Republican candidate selected
by the politicians and the railroad can ever again be
elected Governor in California. The time has at last
arrived when the people have to be consulted. In the
election booths, alone with their ballots, their red
rubber stamps and their God, no boss controls them,
no corporation can tell them what they shall do.
THE ECONOMY OF TRUTH-
\A ACAULAY says that while it may occasion
/ \ ally occur that individuals have profited by
* *â  falsehood and sharp practice, history fails to
record any advantage gained to a nation by those
means.
It is evident that in national affairs truth serves
the ends of economy, and therefore of popular hap
piness and prosperity.
There has been recently published a book made up
of the correspondence and reminiscences of a lady
who was in service in the camps and hospitals during
our Civil War. It is especially rich in expres
sions, verbal and epistolary, of sick and wounded
Confederates, who were prisoners of war and bene
ficiaries of our superior hospital facilities. These all
reveal the prevalence in the South of untruthful ideas
and unreasoning prejudice against the Northern peo
ple. They bring into sharp relief the ante-bellum dif
ference in the characteristics of the two peoples, and
startle one with the revelation of the gulf that was
between them and the progress that had been un
consciously made toward the foundation of two na
tions, divided by Mason and Dixon's line. At that
line the gauge of every railway changed. This made
an actual frontier for commerce. All freight had to
break bulk and all passengers had to change. This
gave steady growth to the impression of passing into
another country. The Confederate prisoners, finding
their wounds and weakness ministered unto in our
camps and hospitals, weje free in their comments
upon the falsehoods that had been taught them. They
had been made to believe that Northern men would
not fight. This belief was strengthened by the first
battle of Bull Run, into which the Federal forces
were rushed, hot-headedly, without preparation.
Later battles were entered by the Confederates in the
belief that all they had to do was to quickstep fast
enough to get within range of their fleeing foes.
When they met the solid and unyielding walls of
blue their mistake was paid for. So they were con
stantly saying to their Northern nurses and doctors,
"If I had known what I know now, I would never
have favored this war."
The truth had not reached them, and the lack of it
cost them dearly. For want of it they suffered
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JULY 29, 1898.
economic and physical, losses of the severest char
acter.
Spain is a victim of the same unwise policy. Her
people have not only been kept in ignorance of the
people of the United States and their resources, but
they have been filled with falsehoods about them.
They have been made to believe that we would not
fight, that our navy is manned by foreign -mer
cenaries, that our armies are without discipline, our
officers lacking in tactical skill, and that if we took
prisoners they would be tortured. War is a stern
missionary, but is doing its work. The Spanish sol
diers and sailors we have taken in battle have had the
most generous treatment. Emerging from months of
short rations and misery under their own neglectful
Government, they are fed and clad and nursed and
doctored by their captors. So it has come to
pass, for the first time in the history of war, that our
prisoners are cheering our flag and looking coldly
on their own.
This is a compliment to the republic which the
genius of history will not fail to record. Between
20,000 and 40,000 of these prisoners w-ill be sent home
in comfort. Each one goes to Spain a living witness
that his countrymen have been taught a lie about this
country and its people. Each one goes to plant in
Spain the spirit of revolt against a system which
keeps its people in ignorance, and a country which
has been made to believe a He and be damned.
It may be expected that an intellectual ferment will
be propagated in Spain, and that her compensation
for the loss and humiliation of defeat will be in lifting
her people upon a plane where they will demand that
the truth be told and will accept nothing else.
Those who advocate mighty changes in our system
of government, and who pine for what they regard
as great material advantages, should pause and be
admonished that our strength has come, not from
our lavish materialities, but from the enlightenment
of our people, from the spirit which demands truth
and fair play in all national matters, and that firm
purpose to treat a fallen enemy as a brother man.
THE MARKET-STREET MUDDLE.
\/l ARKET STREET has long been to San
/ I Francisco not only a thoroughfare, but a
* * nuisance and a problem. Its condition as re
gards cleaning, paving, grading, street car regula
tions and sewering has constituted the nuisance, and
the difficulty of devising an adequate remedy for the
complex evils of the condition has formed the
problem.
As regards the nuisance there is but one opinion
among the people, but with respect to the solution of
the problem there are almost as many ideas as there
are citizens. The result of it all has been a confusion
popularly known as a muddle, and the condition of
the street has gone from bad to worse until it now
strikes every public-spirited citizen and every intel
ligent visitor as a disgrace to the municipality.
Under these circumstances it was natural that a
general approval followed the action of the Board of
Supervisors in starting a movement which promises
to settle some of the disputed and most important
points in the problem of improvement. The Board
has formally declared the Market Street Railway
Company has no power or authority to maintain or
use in any manner or for any purpose the respective
tracks now laid and operated by horse cars on the
Market street roadway, and by resolution it has or
dered the company to remove the tracks on or be
fore August 6.
The railway company has disputed the right of the
Supervisors to have the horse car tracks removed,
and has asserted for itself the right to maintain and
operate them. Thus a clear and well defined issue of
law is raised, and if both sides stand firm and the
matter is promptly pushed forward in the courts, we
may expect to have that much of the Market street
muddle cleared up in the near future. The issue
being one of law, it is not worth while for the people
or the press to pronounce judgment upon it or even to
agitate it further than to insist that, having now been
definitely raised, the question should be diligently
prosecuted in the courts and finally adjudicated.
If the courts should hold that as the law stands the
city has no authority to compel the railway company
to make way for the much needed improvement of
the thoroughfare, it will then be in order to procure
the enactment, if possible, of a law that will bestow
that power upon the municipality. No monopoly or
corporation, however strong, can be permitted to
permanently block the way to the improvement of
a public highway in an American community, nor to
shirk its proper share of the cost. That much is be
yond dispute, and the sooner the issue now raised
with the Market Street Company can be brought to
the test of existing law the better it will be for all
concerned.
Beyond this legal problem, which is entirely a
matter for the court?, there is another phase of the
improvement problem â one which should be dis
cussed thoroughly by all citizens. That is the ques
tion of the form the proposed improvement is to take
and, the manner in which it is to be carried out.
Market street cannot be permanently improved by
any such method as that which has been adopted in
the present work. The laying of a bitumen pave
ment as provided for by the Board of Supervisors
will be merely a piece of patchwork, and as soon as
the genuine improvement of the street is undertaken
it will have to be torn up. The lower part of the
street will have to be raised up to the official grade
before it can be permanently paved. Excavations
will have to be made for sewers and underground
wires. These things are essential parts of the im
provement that must be eventually carried out, and
all pavements laid before the excavations are made
will have to be torn up.
It will be seen that we are not yet at the end of the
muddle. The one source of gratification is that the
subject has taken a shape that promises good results.
The enterprise, having been started, should be kept
moving until the courts have determined the law
questions involved and competent experts have for
mulated for us a fitting method of making the im
provements worthy of the thoroughfare â commo
dious, economical and durable.
Of course we will accept the presence of Russian
battle- ships at Manila as an evidence of warm and
tender friendliness. The Czar does not propose that
Augusti shall row out in a skiff and demolish Dewey.
Citizens will watch with interest the contest for

DEAF MUTES TESTIFY IN COURT.
"Now I want silence In the court while this case is going on," said Judge Mogan yesterday, when the case of
Daniel O'Brien and Sigmund Horn, charged with battery, was called. Bailiff Farrell whispered in the Judge's
ear, and he corrected himself by saying, "I forgot this was the deaf mute case, and we will have silence enough."
The defendants are deaf mutes, and so is the complaining witness, Isidore Selig. a shipping clerk, living at
805 Van Ness avenue. Selig was represented by Theodore Grady, a dtaf-mute attorney, but the defendants were
unrepresented. The only ones interested in the case who could talk and hear were the Judge and Prosecuting
Attorney Spinetti. There were a number of deaf mutes in the courtroom.
Police Sergeant John Green was called as Interpreter. He is thoroughly at home in the deaf-mute language,
and was warmly complimented by the defendants, complaining witness and Attorney Grady for his fairness and ac
curacy. "When the sergeant entered the courtroom, William R. Keefe, a boy who saw the fight, was giving his
testimony. The sergeant, thinking he was a deaf mute, began to wriggle his fingers at him, to his astonishment
and the amusement of those in court.
Keefe's testimony was to the effect that on Saturday evening he saw the defendants meet the complaining
witness at the alley near Selig's residence on the avenue. Selig was carrying a bundle and Horn knocked it out
of his hand, while O'Brien punched him on the jaw. Selig and Horn closed, and Horn tripped Selig- up. Both fell,
and O'Brien picked Horn up and threw him on top of Selig. Then a man came up, and the defendants went
down the alley. Horn was bleeding at the nose. They sent a note to Selig, and he sent a reply, which read: "I don't
believe you. Go away or I will call for the police."
The defendants then went away, after making signs with their fingers at Selig.
Green interpreted the boy's evidence to the defendants, and there was a lively interchange of finger signs be
tween them and the sergeant, who explained that the defendants were satisfied with the testimony. Hardy Stev
ens, another boy, testified almost to the same effect as Keefe.
Selig then took the stand. The prosecuting attorney put the questions, which the sergeant Interpreted with
his fingers, and Selig replied in the same way. He had known the defendants for twelve years, as they were at
the school at Berkeley together.
"You were one of the prize orators at the school, weren't you?" asked Spinetti, and Selig admitted that he
Speaking of the battery, Sellg said that Horn knocked the bundle out of his hand and O'Brien hit him on the
jaw. He ilustrated with his hands the character of the blow. O'Brien said he wanted to fight him for calling him
bad names. Then Horn asked him why he had called O'Brien bad names, and struck him. They fell together 01
the sidewalk, and O'Brien picked Horn up and threw him on top of him. His trousers were torn in the tight, and
they were produced in court. Selig denied calling O'Brien bad names. O'Britn \v;ts a professional boxer.
O'Brien was called to the stand, and declared that Selig had called him a hoodlum, and he and Horn went
back to him for an explanation. They had some "words" and a fight.
Grady, In cross-examining O'Brien, asked him if he were not taught by his teacher that fighting was wrong.
O'Brien shook his head, and Grady repeated the question. The Judge stopped him. and asked, through Green, if
O'Brien was willing to shake hands with Selig and promise not to trouble him aurain. O'Briea signified his willing
ness, and so did Horn; but when Selig was asked if he would shake hands he emphatically declined, and on being
asked his reason promptly replied, "They are low-class persons." He signaled that he wanted them punished.
"I don't like to send these young men to jail," said the Judge. "They are burdened with a serious misfortune
already, and if they will faithfully promise not to molest Selig- a.gain I will dismiss the ease."
O'Brien and Horn gave the desired promise and the cases were dismissed. Selig, when It was explained to
him that if they annoyed him again they would be punished, expressed his approval.
During the hearing of the case there was dead silence in the courtroom, all eyes being focused on the agile
fingers of the sergeant and the deaf-mute witnesses, who were intensely in earnest. It was one of the most unique
spectacles ever seen In a court of justice, and seemed to leave a startling impression upon the mind of the
young Judge as he pondered over the usual procedure In a case when other than deaf mutes wÂ«_re interested.

THE CALENDARâ G. L. D., Camp
Mt-rritt, City. The Roman calendar was
introduced by Romulus, who divided the
year into ten months, comprising 304
days, 73S B. C. That year was of fifty
days less duration than the lunar year
and of sixty-one less than the solar year,
and its commencement did not correspond
â with any fixed season. Numa Pompilius,
713 B. C, added two months, and Julius
Caesar. 45 B. C. to make it more correct,
fixed the solar year at 3Gi days and 6
hours, every fourth year being bissextile
or leap year. That calendar was defec
tive, as the solar year consists <>f "â¢'.:< days
5 hours and 49 minutes and not : Ââ  days S
hours. That difference in the BiXI
century amounted to ten entire day*, the
vernal equinox falling on the 11th instead
of the 21st of March. To obviate that
error Pope Gregory XIII ordained In tf&l
that that year should consist of 356 days
only (October 5 became October 15): and
to prevent further irregularity it was de
termined that a year beginning a century
should not be bissextile, with the excep
tion of that beginning each fourth cen
tury; thus 17ou and ISOO have not been
bissextile nor will 1900 be so. but the year
2000 will be a leap year. In this manner
three days are retrenched in 400 years,
because the lapse of eleven minutes
makes three days in about that period.
The year of the calendar is thus made as

the intention of the presidents to call on
Brigadier General Miller, post command
ant at the Presidio, and ascertain whether
their society could use a house in the
Presidio for that purpose. In the event
that there is none vacant it is the pur
pose of the society to rent a house just
outside the lines and fix it up completely.
The Oakland Red Cross has volunteered
to aid the local society in every way. It
is thought that the plan will be in opera
tion within a few days.
J. R. Johnson, of 1530 Guerrero street,
has offered to take an Ice plant to Ma
nila which will turn out seven tons daily
if the society will stand half the expense
of transportation. He also agrees to give
the Red Cross half the amount of ice
turned out and a half interest in the
plant. As the offer is a generous ono
Mr. Johnson will be asljed to visit the
State headquarters and the project will
be discussed.

THEY OBJECT TO
DOUBLE TRACKS
MISSION PROPERTY OWNERS
VS. SOUTHERN P CIFIC.
The Former Contend That the Pres
ent Line Should Be at Once
Removed.
Ten representatives from the Mission
Improvement Clubs appeared before the
Street Committee of the Board of Su
pervisors yesterday to enter protest
against the granting to the Southern Pa
cific Company of the light to lay double
tracks on the route now traversed by the
company from the Townsenrl street depot
to Ocean View. A. B. Magulre and Eu
gene Sullivan, who acted as spokesmen
for the committee, said that the company
had no legal right to use the streets now
traversed by the company. They con
tended that the company, instead of being
granted the privilege asked for. should
be compelled to remove the present single
track and run its line along the bay s*liore
in conformity with the terms of a fran
chise granted several yeurs ago. It was
represented that the use of the present
tracks caused serious deterioration In
property values along the line and that a
double track system would make the
property almost valueless.
The railroad company was not repre
sented at the meeting and tha^committee
decided to take the matter under advise-
ment.
The question of removing the turntables
at the intersection of Geary and Kearny
Streets and Post and Montgomery
streets, on the ground that they are pub
lic nuisances and dangerous to the life
and limb of pedestrians, was also con
sidered. The Market Street Railway-
Company, throiiKh Manager A r ining, sent
a communication to the committee, prom
ising that if the turntables were allowed
to remain the company would. In the
event of the city paving up to the unoffi
cial grade on which the turntables are
now built, defray all the expenses of re
paying that portion of the streets affect
ed when other terminal points were se
cured. It is the desire of the people that
both turntables be removed to the wester
ly line of Kearny and the wester
ly line of Montgomery street in order that
Market Ftreet between Second and Sixth
Btreets, now being prepared for bitumen,
be of uniform grade. The railroad com
pany hopes to retain the turntables at
their present points in the expectation of
being able to run into Market street and
directly reach the ferry depots. The com
mittee decided to refer the matter to the
entire Board of Supervisors.
The City Engineer was Instructed by
the committee to report on the advisabil
ity of changing the grade on Leaven
worth street between Hay and Chestnut
and on Francisco street between Jones
and Hyde.*
A communication from the property
owners on Julian avenue, between Fif
teenth and Sixteenth streets, protesting
against the change of the present line of
the avenue, was placed on file. The claim
is made on one side that some of the
owners hold five feet of the avenue as
private property and in answer the ac
cused say that their deeds of conveyance
grant to them the property they claim.
THE WAR TAX AND
EXPRESS COMPANIES
CORPORATIONS LOSE ONE TEST
CASE IN CHICAGO.
It Is Likely to Be Carried to the
United States Supreme Court.
Long Fight Promised.
The express and transportation com
panies that have refused to pay the war
tax imposed by the Government and com
pelled their patrons to pay it at the rate
of 1 cent on every receipt and bill of
lading have received their first set-back
by one of the courts in Chicago. Several
of these companies In the East, as Wells-
Fargo has here, decided to make a stand
against paying the tax, and in New York
and Chicago actions were brought against
them. The merchants of this city de
cided to take similar steps, which caused
Wclls-Fargo's people to squirm.
An armistice for a short period of time
was announced by the merchants until
their officers o<suld learn if the casee men
tioned were being pushed on their merits,
or likely to be decided soon.
Yesterday Manager Valentine of the
express company sent the following letter
to the express company:
SAN FRANCISCO, July 2S, 1898.
Merchants' Association â Gentlemen: Ac
knowledging your letter of to-day, I shall be
pleased to give you any Information that comes
to me. and will begin by saying that I have
this moment received a telegram from Chicago
saying -that the decision of the court there is
against the United States Express Company.
1 will keep you advised of any information.
Yours truly, J. J. VALENTINE.
CHICAGO, July 28.â Judge Tuley of the
Circuit Court to-day ruled in favor of
the shippers in the test case brought by
the Illinois; Manufacturers' Association,
granting a writ of mandamus compelling
the United States Express Company to
accept : for transportation . packages for
shipment without the payment of 1 cent
in excess of the regular rate. The case
will be appealed by the defendants.
The court held that it was not within
the domain: of the shipper to. .issue the
bill, and that the law expressly provides
that the person issuing- the receipt shall
afiix the stamp. Three million dollars an
nually is the estimated sum which the
express companies will have to pay in
case the opinion Is sustained by the
higher courts.
LOS ANGELES, July 28.â The Attorney
General to-day instructed the District At
torney in the matter of prosecuting the
express companies for refusing to stamp
or accept. unstamped packages. He says:
"It is not a violation of the revenue act
for a carrier â¢to refuse to : accept ; mer
chandise for shipment. The penalty ac
crues If goods are accepted for shipment
and the carrier â¢ fails to issue a bill of
lading or manifest. It is criminal if the
carrier issues a bill of lading, or mani
fest â¢' without the stamp. .. Prosecution
should ' not begin unless the laws of the
United States are violated."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. July 2S.â The stock market to- '
day dropped back Into a rut and drifted slug- 1
gishly on small transactions except for several
individual stocks, which .were Influenced by 1
special causes. The fact that yesterday's up- I
ward movement was stopped In luelf made the !
bears among the traders, althoug.i It was at
tributed to sympathy with the sharp break In
Sugar. Sugar continued to be the center of
Interest to-day and trading was feverish, the
price vibrating about, above and below yester
. day's close over a range of 2 points. . The j
feverish tone was due to doubts as to whether
the recently formed bull pool had finished Its
campaign against the shorts. The bears at one
time forced the price down to 136, but there was
evidence of support and they were driven to |
cover. A brisk upward movement In Manhat
tan was also supposed to be the result of - a
much heralded campaign against the shorts In
that stock. The Rubber stocks were strong
on the belief that opposition to the company
ceases by , the death of a leading competitor.
The stock of th? Linseed Oil Trust - slumped
violently from 9 to 4 on reports of the em
barrassment of the company, due to the seed
market. People's Gas dropped up to the time
of the receipt of the news that the pending
â ult against- the company for a receiver for
Equitable Gas had been thrown out. With that
the stock rose IS on a heavy covering move
ment, but reacted before the close, which was
at a net advance of only V -
In the railroad list the publication of thÂ»
June statement of St. Paul earnings showing a
decrease in net of over $30,000 by reason of
Increased operating expenses, brought out con
siderable offerings of the grangers. Declines
were in all cases, however, limited to frac
tions. Opinion Is divided of the benefit to ac
crue from the Impending gold Imports. A
threat of these has put an and to London trac
ing In Americans . owing to the fears of the
future effect upon ! the money market then?.
With money so plentiful here a further expan
sion of the currency by gold Imports Is felt to
be of doubtful advantage.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, July 2S.â Higher cables from Liv- '
erpool and unfavorable weather for corn '
started wheat higher. The reaction theory j
also seemed to savor some recover}'. The drop
for the past few days has been such that the '
trade seemed to come to the conclusion that
It was a good time to. buy. Shorts were dis
posed to cover and secure profits and there j
was more or less demand for the lons account. :
Later, when numerous cro^> damage reports
about corn were being received and the market
for that commodity began jto be considerably
affected by them, still further strength was
Imparted to wheat. The interest in cash or
July was revived. It was evident that there
was still considerable shortage, and this caused
a bullish feeling. July shorts became anxious 1
and covered - freely, and . that month showed
more strength than anything else." Bids on a !
basis of yesterday's cash prices were in the !
market here for considerable quantities of !
Kansas No. 2 hard, but the wheat could not
be secured. July closed 14c higher. September
rose \@vÂ»c and declined %c.
Corn was unexpectedly easy for a few min
utes' at the opening. This weakness was of
short duration, however, as the reports from '
the country were too bullish as regards 'the
damage done by dry weather for the market
to Ignore its existence. September closed with
a gain of lc.

COFFEEâ circular of C. E. Bickford
says: "The 1 month has been one of extreme
dullness and there are practically no settled
values -for- any qualities other than . unwashed
Salvadors. which are steady at about former
figures, holders believing that a further re
duction is not warranted by circumstances nor
would it stimulate legitimate business if ac
cepted. Washed Coffees of all descriptions,
worth say 12c and over on nominal valuations,
have been and are decidedly soft and prices ob
tained for the few parcels sold show much
irregularity.
"Very low grades, say from Be to "c, show a
clearly defined basis of values. The receipts
of these have been unusually light so far this
season, and. If sound, would In moderate quan
tities find an outlet within the range given. '

OUR REASONS FOR PRIDE.
Why should we not be proua of our
boys? Look at the way they have be
haved all along the line, and then re
fuse to take you- hat off if you can.
All the rest of the world is surprised,
but we Americans are not, for we know
the stuff they are made of and expect
ed them to -o just what they have
done. Still, we cannot help being proud
of them, in common with all the rest
of mankind.
Three months iTO they, were in our
warehouses and counting houses and
i on our farms r.nd in our machine shops.
If you didn't know better you would
say that that was not tough enough
material for the hard work of war. Bu
down at Santiago they are like veter
ans, and even when they were caught
in an ambush and couldn't see twenty
feet ahead, on account of the under
brush, and the air was full of lead, they
stood their ground bravely and stead
ily advanced, forcing the Spaniards to
retreat.
We have had this matter in hand
but a few weeks, and yet there are
instances of peculiar daring enough to
fill a whole page of history. Privates
and officers alike seeem to be on the
alert for opportunities which will test
their mettle, and voluntec-s for an ex
pedition which involves almost certain
death are to be had in over .helming
numbers.
These are the kind of men which
American institutions have produced,
and we have a right to be proud of
them. â New Ttirk Herald.

confusing, and. it is not to be wondered
at that the chairman could not tell wheth
er they were talking about "guberna

There was a lar.c 1 attendance at the

view of his boped-for greatness, did not

tried to dictate his wishes In respect to
primary election officers â which
wishes were politely ignored.

After the call of the State Central Com
mittee had been read several communica
tions, including an invitation from the
iblican Club to hold the
eountv convention In that place, and the i
tender of Germanla Hall. Oakland, free
of charge, for the same purpose, were
presented.
It waa vnted to fix a date for the pri.
marv to elect delegates to the State con
vention and Mautalen moved that Sat
urday, August IS, be selected as the time.
Then came the first of Chairman Flet
: roubles. The motion was amended
to keep the polls open from S a. m. to 8
p. m.. cl' Bely followed by a second
Iment to make the hours from 7 to
7. Finally the matter was straightened
out to his satisfaction, the second amend
ment withdrawn, and the original mo
tion, with the amendment, was carried.
Harris then moved that the committee '
Issue a call for a second primary for the
election of delegates from Alameda Coun-
Ifd Ci ngresslbnal convention,]
ard flj ! it" for Wednesday, Au

and the executive committee was
instructed to Issue calls for the two pri- i
marles and also to select headquarters ;

A recess was then taken to arrange
for the apportionment of delegates under

ng Church presented the following
apportionment, winch was adopted with
the addition of one delegate at lurge
from each Assembly District.

delegates.
A total of sixty-seven delegates, aside
from the six at large.
Riley moved that the matter of ap
pointing election officers and selecting
polling places be left to the respective
county committeemen, to report at the
next meeting. This was carried after
many amendments and substitutes had
been offered, to the distress of the chair-
man.
Then Pardee dipped his finger into the
pol. Riley movd that th^ primary elec
tion officers consist of two judges, two
Inspectors and two clerks. Others thought
cix were too many for each precinct, as
their services would be gratuitous, and
an amendment was offered that they be
reduced to one each. This did not suit
â Pardee, and at his solicitation a substi
tute was offr-red providing- for two
Judges and clerks and one Inspector. The
matter was compromised By allowing two
clerks, and aftc-r voting to have the for
mer political lines remain Intact until
the county convention meeta in order to
jrivp Striker jurisdiction over that terri
tory recently annexed to Oakland the
committee adjourned till next Monday
afternoon.
SEEKING AN OUTLET.
Moraga Farmers Desire to Haul
Their Hay Over a Better Road
Into Oakland.
OAKLAND, July 28.â The farmers of
the Moraga grant section are troubled
as to how they are going to get their
big yield of hay into the Oakland mar
ket, for the present road by way of
Thornhill is in poor condition. Farmers
have been compelled to haul a half-load
up to the summit, then return for the
other half, and this has proved decidedly
expensive.
Supervisor Hemme of Contra Costa
â  y, while In town, interviewed nu
merous citizens, asking them to enlist
their inUTests toward compieting the bill
road, which will furnish a proper outlet.
Bald Supervisor Hemme: "There were
probably 4'juO tons ot hay grown this year
in Moraga district and practically all
of it looki to Oakland for a market. Be
the hay. there are great quantities
of poultry and other farm products. There
â¢.re probabl) 300 people living In that dis
trict,'and they want to do all thHr buying
and Belling In Oakland. It would pay the
to-wii^f.-oiiW: to give them a chance.
"There is a good, easy 7 per cent grade
roa-1 to the Afameda County line, and ali
â  that li needed i- for this county to build
a plec-f of road three-quarters of a mile
long, connecting with our mud, to make
a thorough route aiÂ»l facilitate business.
I could gi-t a man who would grade that
â¢ three-quarters < f a mile for jaw but say
â  it will cost 11600 to ilx It .-ill up in good
shape, would'nt it pay Alameda County
â¢ -to buyd the road?
" v - â â â ''â  that Supervisor Talcott
â¢ 1r desirous ol having th<- work done but
â  will need to get the money out of the no
. eral road fund, as the district fund can
not stand the drain. Your county has a
large general roitd fund, and I hope there
will !)'â  no difficulty in g.-tting the allow

The Wrecked Trestle, a Hundred
Feet From the Filters That
Exploded.
A FREAK OF
THE EXPLOSION
Blew a Trestle End on
to the Works.
FRAIL GLASS PRESERVED
FOUR FUNERALS TO BE HELD
AT tINOLE TO-DAY.
Officials Still Believe That the First
Explosion Was Caused by
the Use of a
Fuse.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90b Broadway. July 2S.
One of the most peculiar -incidents of
the explosion at Pinole yesterday was the
wrecking of a trestle that runs from the
nitro-glycerine house to some oil tanks.
This trestle Is an expensive, substantial
structure, and runs straight out from
the blow tank that caused the first ex
plosion. When the explosion occurred it
struck the trestle end on, and yet it de
molished several sections of it, extending
over 100 feet. Delicate machinery within
ten feet of the blow tank was unharmed,
while many of the heavy timbers of the
trestle were completely wrecked.
It is not thought that any of those in
jured will now succumb to their injuries.
! At Fabiola, where J. B. Rice, John Brun
ton, Ed Healy and Lev! Kvans were
taken, it is reported that they are all
doing well, and from St. Mary^s Hospital
comes the same report.
The report started yesterday afternoon
> that another victim was liKely to be
found Is untrue, for the whole of the
wreck, which was in reality very small,
has been cleared up, and it is impossible
i that any but the four already known can
have lost their lives.
The officers of the Hercules works con
'' tlnue to believe that the first explosion
| was caused by the placing of a fuse in
' the works, although they are unable to
offer any clew as to the identity of the
malicious party. Mr. Quinan, superln
j tendent, says that they have not taken
I on many new men for several months, but
as tho company employs 250 people, it is
impossible for them to guarantee the
faithfulness of them all. He prefers to
think that the fuse was placed in the
nitro-glycerine house by a stranger, al
though he is forced to admit that there
is some reason to believe it was put
there by some one well acquainted with
i the works.
'"Possibly," he said, "there Is a dissatls
| fied man in the works who desired to
' cause us great loss. Tho nitro-house con
' tains much valuable machinery, and had
| it been wrecked the expense would have
I been great. There Ik notnlng to indicate
I that the man who placed the fuse was
i anxious to destroy any human beings, as
â  it was done at an hour when no one was
around."
Coroner Curry has impaneled a jury,
' and they will inquire Into the catastrophe
I on Saturday.
The funerals of John Ashe. Patrick
i Murphy and J. L. Alverez, three of the
victims, will take place to-morrow morn-
Ing at Pinole, and they will be interred
at St. Mary's Cemetery. The funeral of
Herbert Stratton, the fourth victim, will
also be held to-morrow, and the remains
taken to San Francisco for interment.
DRUMMER PARKER IS
ADJUDGED INSANE
TRIED TO END HIS TROUBLES
BY ASPHYXIATION.
Refused to Give Any Information
That Might Lead to His Iden
tity or Past History.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, July 28.
Alfred E. Parker, the drummer, who
claimed to be under the hypnotic spell
of a Dr. Pierson of San Luis Obispo and
who became demented from worrying
over an unsuccessful trip for the White
Manufacturing Company of Los Angeles,
was to-day committed to the Stockton
Asylum by Judge Hall.
Parker came over from San Francisco
last night and wont to the Washington
street House, where he attempted to
commit suicide by gas asphyxiation.
When Officers Carson and Hynes reached
the would-be suicidti's room they found
it tilled with gas; the pipo was bent down
more than a foot and it is supposed that
Parker bent over the jet until overcome,
when he fell to the floor. The escaping
gas fumes at t -acted the chambermaid's
attention, when an investigation led to
the 'discovery of the unconscious man.
Vie was taken to the Receiving Hospi
tal and writhed with pain, but refused to
give any Information as to his identity
or past life. He was taken before the
Lunacy Commissioners this afternoon
and declared Insane. Parker is about 36
years of age and of comely appearance.

COOLLY ASKS COIN.
Health Officer Dunn Hears From a
Doctor Whom He Once Displeased.
OAKLAND, July 28.â Health Officer
Dunn has received a scathing letter from
Dr. Moore- of Berkeley. The writer ad
vised Dr. Dunn to settle with a $100 check
the grievance that now exists between
them.
Dr. Moore refers to some case in which
he was interested and when he was op
posed to Dr. Dunn. On looking at the
record the Health Officer round that two
weeks ago he had refused to register a
death notice certiilcd to by a Dr. Moore,
because the latter had not registered as
a practicing physician. Another doctor
was required to sign the death certifi
cate.
This evidently angered Dr. Moore, and
in his letter he says: "You can avoid a
scandal by sending me a check for $100.
If you do not do this you will have a suit
on your hands for $10,000. I have endured
this conspiracy as long as I can, and if it
does not stop certain fiends, who are
quacks, may die with their boots on."
Dr. Dunn says he will have steps taken
to prevent Dr. Moore from practicing
without being registered, and also for
sending threatening letters through the
mails.
HOW A WEAK WOMAN
BAFFLED A THIEF
WITH THE AID OF A DOG SHE
SECURES THE BOOTY.
Gold Watch and Chain Taken From
a Vest Almost in Sight of Its
Owner.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
I<QS Broadway, July 2S.
Half a dozen women chasing a thief
was the sight that amused residents on
Thirty-sixth street this morning. The
women were accompanied by a dog, and
whether the thief was more afraid of the
ladies than of the animal may never be
known, for he threw away his booty and
was permitted to escape.
There have been a few cases of robbery
lately in North Oakland, but the crime
committed at the house of W. J. Aber
nathy on Thirty-sixth street this morn
ing is one of the boldest.
Mr. Abornathy is the owner of a valu
able gold watch and chain which he car
ries in his vest. This morning he went
into his basement to do a little heavy
work, and removing his vest hung it on
the door. While conversing with his wife
a few feyt away, a thief took the watch
aiid chain from the vest and ran off.
Had he walked off he might have got
away with the Jewelry, but he ran so
fast that Mrs. Abernathy suspected some
thing was wrong. Her husband putting
on his vest to go and see what was the
matter discovered the loss of his watch
and chain. The thief managed to dodge
the Abemathys, but a little later, after
husband had gone down town to report
his loss to the detectives, his wife saw
the same man a block away. She called
to her dog, and with half a dozen other
ladies gave chase, and after running for
two or three blocks the thief was so
frightened that he threw the watch and
chaJn on the sidewalk.
After recovering the booty, the ladloa
were quite willing that the robber should
escape, and he is still at large, although
the police have a good description of
him.

TESTIFY TO
HIS LUNACY
Ex-Mayor Chapman a
Witness for Moffitt.
STATE'S CASE SOON ENDED
THE WIFE-SLAYER SUBJECT TO
MENTAL ABERRATION.
His Sole Defense Is That He Did Not
Know What He Was Doing
at the Time He
Shot.
Oakland Office, San Francisco Call,
MS Broadway. Ally 28.
J. H. Moitett, accused of the murder of
his wife, Lucy Moffett, was on trial this
morning, before Judpe Hall.
"With the testimony of E. A. O'Brien, a
reporter, the prosecution concluded be
fore the noon recess. The first witness
for the defenre was M. C, Chapman, who
km w the defendant and the secrets of his
domestic life.
"1 have known Mr. Moffett since 1S01,"
said the witness. "He has worked for me
and I have often conversed with him.
Never having h< ard his reputation dis
cussed 1 assume that it was good.
"My opinion is in regard to his men
tal condition that up to the time he re
turned from the country last fail and for
some time after he was of sound mind.
For two or three weeks prior to March 17
he was insane. My reasons for this con
clusion are many. In all the. conversa
tions that 1 ever had with Mr. Moffett he
seemed to be interested in general sub
jects. I do not recall that he ever talked
about himseit' during the period that 1
have stated he was of sound mind. He
was always clear and level-headed and
in my opinion wuukl do nothing without
good reason for it. Although not sun
shiny, he was not gloomy nor festive. His
conversation* with me showed him to be
a man with a line sense of justice. From
the middle of December of last year to
the middle of January tills year 1 Jid not
see him, being away, but when I returned
from Sail Lake 1 found him working on
my house. He appeared to have fallen
away la flesh ami was very gloomy and
despondent. He did not look as tidy per
sonally as he used to, and would not
speak at all exopt in monosyllables. He
was a changed man.
"The night after he completed the work
on my house he called on me and I at
once asked him if he had come for his
money. He said he had not, but his mind
was loaded with trouble. He told me he
was a ruined man and said, 'My heart is
gone.' He talked erratically, cried con
vulsively and was unable to speak for
several minutes. The visit lasted an hour
and a half, and as he was about to go 1
told him that if 1 were in his place I
would go back to the country and never
return. I fled to cheer him up when he
called a week before the shooting of h!s
wife. 1 told him to get away from her
and from the people who were annoying
him. 1 met him the night before the
phootlng and advised him not to be de
spondent. But he said, "Don't, don't, you
are pulling me away!' His mind drifted
into different channels and he was unable
to control it. These are my reasons for
thinking the man insane.
Ex-Mayor Chapman was cross-exam
ined by District Attorney Snook, and said
that Moffett had told him he would not
harm a hair of his wife's head. The Dis
trict Attorney asked Mr. Chapman if his
testimony was not more dramatic than
when Mr. Moffett told him of the things
to which he had testified.
"No. Mr. Snook; no, Mr. Snook,' replied
Chapman in deep, measured tones. "I
could not begin to be as dramatic as Mr.
Moffett was in his simple but harrowing
narrative."
Deputy District Attorney Harry A. Mel
vin was then called to the witness stand
by the defense. He told of knowing Mr.
Moffett as a Juror in the Oakland Police
Court. On the morning of the day before
the murdor the witness saluted him but
Moffett failed to acknowledge it. Mr. Mel
vin believes that Moffett could not have
been normally mental at that time.
A STRANGE DEATH.
Heart Failure Attacks an Alameda
Young Man in Hawaii.
ALAMEDA, July 28.â Mrs. Isabella Jel
linp;g, widow of the late William Jcllings
of this city, received the sad news to-day
of the death of her son, Edward J., which

health. He was so far recovered that he

reached Honolulu on the 14th. Two days
later he went for a walk witn a brother
and a friend on the plantation, where all
thri c were employed. On reaching the
\\";u<ahu River it was proposed to go In

llrst, and after n while he decided also to
take a bath. He wont in, and placing his
hands on the shoulder of his companions
waded Into the water. Suddenly He fell
and slipped into a deep hole. His brother
â¦ ried to get him out, but it was seven
minutes before he could be rescued. Every
enort was made to resuscitate him. but
without success. A medical examination
subsequently disclosed the fact that Jel
iinprs had not been drowned, but that he
had died of heart failure, and was prob
ably 'lead before he fell into the hole.

HUNTINGTON
W ON'T LET GO
People Must Fight for
Market Street.
BATTLE BEGINS AUGUST 6.
SPECIAL MEETING OF STREET
RAILWAY DIRECTORS.
Supervisors' Order for Removal of
Horse-Car Tracks Discussed,
but No Action.
Taken.
W&yor Phclan and the Board of Super
visors on one side and the officials and
attorneys of the Market-street Railway
Company on the other are making prepa
rations for the grtat battle on the 6th of
August, the result of which is of great
moment to the people of San Francisco.
On that day the legal and. perhaps, phy
sical contest for the possession of Market
street will begin. The people Quite nat
urally think they have some Inherent
rights in their thoroughfares, but the
.street railway monopoly has possession
.of them and does not Intend to let go
without a struggle.
There is but one sentiment throughout
the city in regard to the removal of the
Hiorse car tracks which now obstruct and
interfere with traffic on Market street
The railway officials have felt the force
of this popular sentiment and have been
compelled to take cognizance of it. Un
fortunately the only appreciable effect so
far has been to increase the desire of the
Huntingdon Interests to hold the street
indefinitely or force the city to gram
them even more valuable concessions for
c release.
There is a very emphatic difference of
opinion among the directors of the Street
Railway Company on the subject of re
moving the outside tracks, and the two or
â three public-spirited men on the board
may succeed In persuading the others to
give consideration to the just demands
of the people for once. The majority ol
ihe board are linn in their determination,
however, to stand on what they t< rm
their legal rights. The opponents of the
Improvement are depending on a diminu
tion of public sentiment and hope that
interest in the affair will die out before
the expiration of the ten days given the
company to restore the street to the city.
A special meeting of the directors ut
the Market-street Company was held
yesterday afternoon and the resolution
ordering the removal of the track was
discussed at length. Attorney Herrin
was present to advise the boara No
definite action was taken, as tl.e direc
tors were not all of one mind. Never
theless Mr. Herrin informed the news
paper men after the meeting that the
company had decided, after mature con
sideration, that it would not actively op
pose the city in its track-tearing. If the
ilayor and the Board ot Supervisors carry
out their expressed intentions to remove
the tracks on both sides of Market street
they will meet with no opposition from
the' Market-street Railway Company.
It was also given out in the Southern
Pacific building that not even a writ of
Injunction would be sued out by the com
pany, but the company will iile protests
with the Mayor, the Board of Supervisors
and the Superintendent of Streets, warn
ing them that if any of their property
1b mutilated or destroyed by them or by
their orders, they vill be hejd personally
liable for all resulting damages. That is
the extent to which the Market-street
Company will go in their present fight.
Mr. Herrin reiterated his former opin
ion that "The city officials, according to
our interpretation of the statutes and
ordinances, have no right to force the
Market-street Company to tear up the
tracks and repave their portion of the
street. As long as the pavement, as

they cannot force a repavement. That
would be an unwarranted violation of
contract."
Mayor Phelan was informed of Mr. Her
rin's statement that the company would
remain p;iÂ«sive and not attempt to pre
vent the city officials from removing the
tracks. He said: "That is a new attitude
tor the Southern Pacific people to take.
There is nethtne new in the controversy
and probably will not be until the Bth of
August. We are well fortified with legal
advice and know we ore right. We are
not endeavoring to inflict any injustice on
any one. The street railway company
has no right to maintain two separate
lines on any street, and will not be per
mitted to do so."
i. W. Hellman. one of the Market Street
flirectors, said last night:
The directors of the Market Street Railway
Company have not as yet decided what action
â¢wilt be taken in regard to the resolution by
the Board of Supervisors ordering the removal
of the horse car tracks from Market street.
In this connection I wish to be quoted that
there Is not a man on the board who has not
the welfare of San Francisco at heart. But
this Is not a personal mutter with us. Y\'e
represent the lnteitsts of the stockholders, and
as faithful agents we must protect the property
E>f the people we represent. A valuable fran
chise Is involved In this question, and we would
not be doing our duty If we allowed it to be
taken away by force without making some
effort to conserve the rights of the owners.
The convenience tt the people who patronize
the horse car lines must also be considered.
(These lines are renJly an nutlet for south of
Market street, and thousands of people depend
on them to get to and from their places of
business. The argument that the horse care
could be transferred to the cable tracks on
Market street Is absurd. During certain hours
Â»ach day the cable cars are running only a
length apart, and an attempt to run horse
DESERTED THE "MOLLIE MAGUIRES."
Klameda County "Straight-Out" Populists Organize a New
County Committee.
OAKLAND. July 28.â The Populists
of Alameda County, or that fac
tion that cast off their Popullstlc
raiment at Sacramento and surren
dered themselves to the embraces
of the Molly Magulres, have found
that they are unable to deliver the goods
they bargained to the Democrats. The
County Central Committee met to-night,
md after a long and exasperatlngly te-
Sious wrangle, those members who have
remained steadfast to their party prln
;lples abandoned the meeting and organ
y.ed a straight-out Populist County Com
ailttee.
D. T. FowJer, the regular Populist nom
inee for Lieutenant Governor, called the
first meeting together as temporary
jhaJrman and as soon as Secretary Cor
aell had presented resolutions of respect
:o the memory of Charles White, Gus
Koch and C. D. Cameron, who were
illled in the Melrose explosion, the trou-
Dle began.
G. R. Reed sounded the first discordant
note by offering a resolution indorsing
.he fihanahan ticket. The resolution was
Jereatedâ l6 to 10. Some of the fusionists
wanted to have the meeting held behind
Ilosed doors, but when several of the mid
ile-of-the-roadsters threatened then and
:here to walk out the motion was de
feated.
Sreen Majors then pot up and talked
itraight to the point. He called attention
:o the difference of opinion that prevailed
unong the members and said they mipht
is well dlviue then as later, for it would
se impossible for them to work in har
nony.
Gelder attempted to speak, but was
v&b promptly called down by the chair
can.
Oberg said he could not see that he
tould be of any use in the committee and
talked out, being the first to bolt.
The matter of permanent organization
ras then taken up, and the fusionists
lamed J. F. Gregory for chairman.
cars between them would delay the entire
traffic of the_-Â«.ity and almost surely result in
interminable blockades.
Superintendent of Streets Ambrose was
out of town yesterday. His attorney has
not as yet given an opinion on the legal

FIRST SESSION OF
THE KNOCKER'S CLUB.
Chairman McLaughlin Re
ceives a Large Delegation
of Citizens.
A session of the "Knockers' Club" was
held in the rooms of the Republican State
Central Committee yesterday morning for
the purpose of dealing a stealthy blow
at the back of Congressman Loud. The
session was strictly executive, and the
over-cautious members even went so far
as to suggest that the cracks around the
door of the meeting room be stuffed with
cotton in order to insure against a breath
of the proceedings reaching the ears of
the newspaper men.
The tirst intimation had by Chairman
McLaughlin that anything unusual was
likely to occur was when a messenger ar
rived at headquarters and informed him
that a large and important delegation of
citizens was about to visit him for the
purpose of waiting on him and protesting
against the candiuucy of one oi our rep
resentatives in Congress. This seemed
to portend something serious, so the
major, always a perfect picture of self
possession, assumed his most dignilied
air and prepared to meet the chosen rep
resentatives of an outraged populace.
He had not long to wait. The sound
of the messenger's footsteps had hardly
died away upon the stair before the dele
gation appeared on the scene. It con
sisted or George AY. Schell, Thomas
Chambers. 1. Simons, a man named Froo
berg, ex-Sergeant of Police Cohen, and
two others whose identity is Â»uill shroud
ed in mystery. They tiled Into the re
ception room and stood gazing awk
wardly at Chairman McLaughlin. Hav
ing been advised that he was expected to
receive a delegation of prominent citizens,
it was several minutes before the major
realized that the heralded delegation had
arrived and was before him. When it
linally dawned upon him he rose, care
fully laid aside his company expression
and saluted the nervous "Knockers'
with:
"Are you the delegation?"
"We are." came the feeble answer,
"and we would like to see you privately
on a matter of great importance.
"Do I understand that your business Is
to protest against the candidacy of one
of our present Congressmen?"
"Tes; that is what we wanted to see
you about."
"Very well. There are some newspaper
representatives here and I presume that
you have no objection to their hearing
What you have to say. "
"Oh," yes we have. We don't want to
pee any newspaper men. We just want
to have a little private talk with you.
We don't want it to get into the papers."
"Very well." said the major, as he
heaved a deep sigh and led the way into
a private room.
When they were beyond the reach of
prying ears" the Knockers drew their
hammers and set to work. They object
ed, they said, to the proposed candidacy
of Congressman Loud and they wanted
the State Central Committee to prevent
his nomination. When asked for reasons
they made all sorts of charges, but were
careful to explain that they had no per
sonal grievances nor any personal
knowledge of the truth of the accusa
tions they were making. Other people
who were not named were authority for
the charges, they said, and they were
only presenting them to the State Cen
tral Committee because they thought
that by doing so they would be serving
the best interests of the party.
For fifteen minutes the Knockers
worked away, and then Chairman Mc-
Laughlin put a sudden stop to the pro
ceedings. He calmly but firmly informed
the hammer wielders that they had
brought their wares to the wrong shop;
that if what they said was true It was
their duty and privilege to call a district
mass meeting and lay their charges be
fore the voters. The State Central Com
mittee, he said, had nothing to do with
the candidacy of any man andâ well,
really, he was very busy and he would
have to bid them good-by.
That fettled it. One minute later the
Knockers' Club had adjourned sine die.
DEWEY REPUBLICAN CLUB
Beginning of a Strong Organ
ization for the Coming
Contest.
Therp was a meeting of the executive
committee of the Dewey Republican Club
last evening in room 28 of the Columbian
building. P. B. Gallagher was chosen as
chairman of the committee. On motion
of John Choice It was decided to holl a
mass meeting in the near future, and that
a committee be appointed to draft a sot
of resolutions, embodying the ideas of a
strong foreign policy and an increase of
the numerical force of the army and
navy in proper prop- rtion to the popula
tion of the country. F. M. Smith. D. W.
McNeill. Henry Meyers. John Choice and
P. J. Joyce were appointed as a commit
tee on hall, music and speakers for the
proposed mass meeting.
On behalf of the Donegal Social Club,
P. B. Gallagher presented complimentary
ticket? to members of the Dewey Club for
their picnic to be held at Wildwood Glen
on Sunday next.
It was decided that a drill corpÃ should
be organized and uniformed as an auxil
iary to the Dewey Club's central organi
zation. Adjourned until Thursday even

Writes About Hawaii and Her Hopes
In Next Sunday's Call.
George R. Reed was nominated b^ the
straight-outs, and on a rising vote Greg
ory received 16 votes, to 7 for Reed.
That was the signal for the antl-fu
slonistK to walk out. Reed, Stewart, Bol
ten. Paulinbaum and Grlmmlns left the
hall without waiting to hand In their
resignations, while Fowler, Majors, Hesse
and Hale wrote out formal resignations.
Fuwler, in presenting hiÃ, said he was
guided by what he thought to be right
in the matter, and he believed those who
opposed him to be actuated by similar
motives. He predicted that all would bo
working shoulder to shoulder In 1900.
There was a long kick over Majors' res
ignation because ho had addressed It to
the "fusion county committee." While
they were wrangling over it a messenger
brought in tho resignations of those who
had walked out first, and these being ad
dressed the same way only added to the
confusion. It was finally decided to de
clare th<-lr places vacant and to have
them filled by the proper clubs.
Cornell was elected permanent secre
tary and J. M. Moore treasurer. B. Cor
nell and J. J. Manning were appointed
committeemen-at-large to fill the vacan
cies caused by the withdrawal of Majors
and Fowler, and then the members drift
ed into a long and senseless debate, tir
ing out most of the members who did not
bolt, and finally adjourned for two weeks.
The straight-out Populists, when they
walked out. met In the ofiico of A. Bretz
and temporarily organized the Populist
County Committee, with the ten bolters,
Reed, Majors, Powler, Stewart, Hale,
Batten, Oborg. Grimmlns, Hesse and

mittee temporarily organized with George

secretary, and adjourned to next Thurs
day night when a permanent organiza
tion will be effected. The greatest har
mony and good feeling prevailed through
out the meeting.
THE SAN" FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JULY 29, 1898.
DEATH OF E. P. CORMAN.
The Poimlar Salesman Defied Sickness for
Twentu-Three Years to Succumb to
a Trifling Injury
THE sudden death of Edward Pierce Corman, resulting from a sup
posedly slight injury, will be a suprlse and the cause of deep regret
to his host of friends in this and surrounding cities. Mr. Corman's
right hand was crushed in a street car door about three weeks ago,
and neither he nor his family physician who dressed the hand thought
the Injury dangerous or even serious. He attended to business for sev
eral days after the accident, but the cords of the third finger of the crushed
hand finally became so drawn that
an operation was advised by his doc
tor.
The leaders of the finger were
lanced at the German Hospital and
the operation seemed bo successful
that on the day it was performed
Mr. Corman went to his employers
and informed them he would be
ready for duty in a few days. The
day following the hand became very
painful, and that evening when Mrs.
Corman returned from a short ab
sence from her husband's bedside
she found him delirious. The family
physician was summoned, but being
unable to diagnose the case he called
in other medical experts. The com
bined efforts of the doctors to al
leviate the suffering of the aatient
or to ascertain the exact cause of
his delirium were unavailing, and
Mr. Corman died yesterday morning
without regaining consciousness.
After Mr. Corman's death the
physicians were greatly perplexed at
finding that the color of the body
had changed to a bright yellow. It is supposed that the convulsions
caused by the intense agony suffered by Mr. Corman caused the gull duct
to burst and disperse Its liquia through the body. An autopsy will be re
quired to discover whether this was the cause or whether there was some
organic trouble unknown to Mr. Corman and his phy.sicians. He had al
ways been a healthy, robust man, and had never had a sick day during
his life. The unexpected death Is a great shock to his widow.
Mr. Corman was one of the oldest and best known salesmen In San
Francisco. He entered the employ of Goldberg, Bowen & Liebenbaum when
the firm was first organized 23 years ago, and at the time of his death
was one of the valued salesmen of Goldberg, Bowen & Co. He grew up
with the business, and during his long term of service was always consid
ered a faithful, trustworthy employe. Thousands of people of San Fran
cisco and Oakland were personally acquainted with him, and his charac
ter was such that acquaintance meant friendship. In all his dealings
with men he was gentlemanly, and his fellow employes with whom he was
associated every day never had cause to complain of his treatment. They
say that during his entire connection with the firm he never had the
least particle of trouble with his assoojjites. The entire establishment
feels bereaved at tho loss of a starch friend and companion.
CONTRACTORS
UNDER FIRE
Lively Session of Harbor
Commissioners.
THAT GALVANIZED IRON WORK
CALLED "AN IMPRACTICABLE
BUT NOT IMPOSSIBLE JOB."
The State Called "Upon to Pay Bills
Incurred by Contractor Camp
bell While Doing the
Boards's Work.
The Harbor Commissioners held a lively
session yesterday. Tne question of the
galvanized Iron worn that was put In the
new union ferry depot contrary to the
plane and specifications was discussed
during a morning session and late into
the afternoon, but no conclusion was ar
rived at.
It appears that the plans and specifica
tions as prepared b->- the iato A. Page
Brown called for the putting in of cer
tain galvanized Iron work in a manner
which Chief Engineer Howard Holmes
and Architect Swain declared impracti
cable. The plans and specifications were
accordingly modified, and the work done
in a much cheaper and easier manner, so
it was asserted. A few days ago con
tractor presented his bill for payment,
and Commissioner Harney raised the
question of a reduction in the contract
price for the reason that the same amount
of labor was not entailed as would have
been required if the original plans hud
been followed.
W. J- Cronan, the contractor, combated
this view, holding that he had well earned
every cent that was coming to him. Fi
nally it was decided to submit the matter
to arbitration. The Commissioners named
Seth Babson, Contractor Cronan named
William Curlett, and the two architects
selected G. Alex "Wright, the present
Grand Jury expert, as umpire.
Yesterday afternoon Babson ana Cur
lett rendered an opinion upholding
Holmes and Swain. In their report they
say it would be "entirely Impracticable to
secure the galvanized Iron to the frame
work in accordance with the plans and
speelncatlone." â 
Then Mr. Babson modified his report by
saying that the work as called for in the
original plans was not impossible, but it
certainly was impracticable. Mr. Curlett
retorted that he would give Mr. Babson
a year in which to make a square inch of
the galvanized piping called for in A.
Page Brown's plans, and would give odds
that he could not make even that Bmall
portion in the time specified.
Commissioner Herold then took up the
matter and drafted a resolution that he
thought would suit everybody. Messrs.
Curlett and Babson were willing to sign
It but Mr. Swain, the board's architect,
obiected most strenuously. It was a
criticism of his work and that he would
not allow. It was his province to advise
the board as to whether the work had
been properly done or not. He did not
object to the Commissioners seeking out
side advice, but he would not have those
outsiders pass upon his work. Commis
sioner Harney then tried his hand at a
resolution that| would straighten out all
the kinks, and that ended In an appeal
to Webster as to the meaning of ' im
practability" and "impossibility." After
a close study of the dictionary the Com
missioners deckled that the words were
synonymous and that settled the discus
sion for yesterday. It will come up again
next Tuesday, and in the meantime Con
tractor Cronan has to wait for his money.
The Commissioners are very much ex
ercised over the disappearance or a con
tractor named G. M. Campbell. He had
the work of putting in the offices on the
Folsom-street wharf, built the shed over
the addition to the Mall dock, and all the
offices for the Spring Valley Water Works
at Folsom street. He collected every cent
that was coming to him from the Harbor
Commission, but failed to pay a number
of tradespeople who had supplied him
with material for the work. Among
these was the Ralston Tron Works and
Dunham. Carrigan & Hayden, and they
have written the Commissioners demand
ing payment of their bills under tb% act
of March 27, 1897, which makes the let
ter of a contract responsible for material
supplied and labor employed on the work.
Under this law the State will have to
pay these bills and then seek to recover
the amount from Campbell's bondsmen.
MISSING FOREST QUEEN.
A Derelict Vessel Sighted Bot
tom Up Believed to
Be She.
While on his way from San Francisco
to Umpqua, in latitude 38:08 north, longi
tude 129:45 west. Captain Raamussen of
the schooner Louise sighted a vessel bot
tom up. She was about IGS feet long, cop
per painted, keel coppered, copper looked
bright and new, while the keel was cov
ered with a four or six inch shoe not cop
pered.
The bark Forest Queen left San Fran
cisco early this year for the Sound In
command of Captain Basby. She had
been overhauled and her bottom copper
painted and keel newly coppered. She
started from.Tacoma for San Pedro with
lumber on March 4 last and has never
been heard of since. Last May The Call
mentioned exclusively that she was miss
ing, and at that time gave a full list of
her crew. The chances are that the bark
turned turtle in a gale and everybody on
board was drowned.
The fug whistle on the lightship was in
working order again last night. During
the day the gasoline schooner Mary C.
took out a supply of coal so the Engineer
was able to get up steam.
Quarantine Officer Craw of the State
Board of Horticulture hud a lively time
on Jackson street wharf yesterday." Some
wormy pears came down from Sacramen
to and Mr. Craw threw them overboard.
Captain Nelson of the California Trans
portation Company attempted to stop him
and a row followed. The matter may end
in the courts, as Mr. Craw threatens to
have Captain Nelson arrested fur inter
fering with a State officer while in the
execution of his duties.
Another Klondike schooner, the Carrie
and Annie, arrived in port yesterday She
was bound from Boston for Seattle, but
put in here for supplies and repairs. The
voyage of ls2 days was a long and tire
some one, and when finally on the 19th
inst. the flying jib-boom and head stays
were carried away it was decided to head
for San Francisco. The gold hunters will
go from here to St. Michael.
The river steamer Queen of the Yukon had
a most rtoceaafUJ trial trip yesterday She
made 11 knots an hour by the lop. and the ma
chinery worked to perfection. When out on a
trial last Wednesday she started an eccentric
and there being no tools aboard to make re
pairs, the vessel went ashore on Goat Island
fahe was towed off and fixed up. and another
trial was had yesterday, which proved the
Queen to be one of the best vessels of her class
built here this year.
THE PUGS SLUGGED
OUT AT WOODWARD'S
JOE REAY WON A DECISION
OVER SOLDIER GREEN.
Kennedy Whipped Allen in a Round,
and George Murphy and Jake
La Rue Boxed a
Draw.
The Excelsior Athletic Club gave its
first professional boxing entertainment
last evening In Woodward's Pavilion be
fore a small crowd, but President Ken
nedy said that enough money was taken
in to pay expenses.
The first event was a ten-round bout
between George Murphy and Jake La
Rue, which enD.J in a draw. Murphy got
an unmerciful hammering from La Rue in
the first two rounds, but La Rue fell away
after that, and Murphy scored a lead up
to the sixth round, when he had La Ruo
groggy.
In the eighth round Murphy staggered
his opponent, but in return for a right
on the Jaw he received a smash on the
nasal appendage that induced the claret
to flow freely. La Rue had the best of the
last round, but Referee Jimmy Lawlor
thought that a draw would be the proper
thing.
Joe Reay of the Olympic Club and Phil
Green, "a bold soldier" boy from Oakland,
had a warm argument for ten rounds
Green opened with a wild rush at his
opponent, and Reay had no easy time
stopping and ducking right and left hand
swings, which appeared to come from no
particular direction.
Green is a very wild and woolly fighter
and understands very little about Queens
berry rules. In the tifth round Reay, who
had been figuring- for some time how he
could put a stop to Green's very low sys
tem of ducking, caught the soldier a
heavy uppercut, which opened a gash
Â° ver , Green's left eye, from which the
blood flowed freely.
Gradually Green lost his dash and
Reay, having discovered how he could
reach his antagonist, wa* content with
keeping Green's face aa a target for up
per cuts and some straight leads. Green
was game, though, and in the ninth and
tenth rounds he tried hard to swing on
Keay's Jaw, but his blows were poorly
directed and failed to do any damage.
Reay left the ring without a scratch,
while Green's face was badly disfigured.
According to Queensberry rules Reay
certalnly won the contest, but if they had
fought under rough-and-tumble rules
Green would certainly have won.
Lawlor decided in favor of Reay and for
so doing was hooted by those who com
posed the "rough-and-tumble" element.
The event of the evening, so-called, was
a contest between heuvy-weiÃhts Joe
Kennedy and Bnly Allen. The last
named pug acted as if he had never had
a glove on before and was stopped the
first punch that Kennedy landed on his
law. It was an easy find for Kennedy.
The contest lasted one and a half min
utes.
"Fat Billy" Almon of the Superintend
ent of Street's office, and not "Fatty"
Blodes. as many people had supposed,
owing to close resemblance, acted as ref
eree.

SUTRO'S HEIRS
WANT HIM AT
HIS OLD HOME
Will Invoke the Law to Take the
Ex-Mayor From Dr. Emma
Merritt's Custody.
They Claim That Amid the Familiar Sur
roundings of the "Heights" He Will Regain
His Mental and Physical Faculties.
The aid of the law is to be again in- ;
Voiced to the end that Adolph Sutro i
may spend the declining days of his I
most remarkable life at his dearly be- !
Joyed heights overlooking the Pacific
Ocean. At present he is to all intents !
and purposes a prisoner, being confined â 
to one room in the home of his daughter
and guardian. Dr. Emma Merritt, on
the northweat corner of Sutter street
and Van Ness avenue.
Since the day of his forcible and sen
sational removal from his old home,
some months since, his household has
been as one divided against itself. His
Bon Charles, his daughter Clara and his
brothers and sisters have brought all
the pressure possible to bear upon Dr.
Merritt to induce her to unbend her will
and permit her father to again return
to his own home. She has the strong
"mind of her illustrious father, devel
oped to the point of obstinacy, it Is af
firmed, and cannot be turned from her
pray.
Her relatives do her the credit to say
that if she errs it is a fault of the mind
and not of the heart, as she has sur
rounded her father with all the com
forts that medical science can suggest.
The one exception to this is the forcible
retention of Mr. Sutro amid uncon
genial surroundings. This, it is
claimed, is the great error she is com
mitting. The unfamiliar room, the ab
sence of people and articles to which
the sturdy millionaire was accustomed,
all prey upon his mind and retard the
complete recovery of his faculties.
Mr. tfutro has not been a helpless in
valid for some time. He is able to be
about his room and for a time was so
well that he was promised a drive. At
the last moment he was denied this
privilege, to his great sorrow. During
â¢vi.-w of the Fourth of July pro
cession he stood at the window of his
room and enjoyed the moving spectacle
before him. He even recognized friends
In the crowds that thronged the streets
and becko-ned them to come to him.
It has been practically determined to
again test the matter through the
turn of the law. Suit will be
brought in the names of his children.
to which will be added those of his two
sisters, residing in this city, and of his
broth) r in Germany. They feel that
were Mr. Sutra's wishes to be consulted
he would have desired above all other
things that his life would go out with
the sun casting its last rays upon his
deathbed as it sank below the horizon
of the Pacific Ocean.
The feeling of Mr. Sutro"s relatives
arc expressed in the appended inter
view with his sister.
'From the day that Mr. Sutro was
removed from his home at Sutro
Heights up to the present time, his
relatives have been trying to convince
Dr. Emma'Merritt, his guardian, that
his removal was not for the best." said
W. "Winterberg, Adolph Sutro's
sister, yesterday. "All the pressure
that could possibly be brought to bear
â¢on her has been exerted, but without
avail. She has her point of view, and
til the rest of his relatives on thU
coast have theirs.
."It seems impossible to reconcile
them, as they are so radically different.
Dr. Merritt is providing all the com
forts that modern, ideas In the treat
ment of the Elck can suggest, except
the one which we feel is most needed
in Mr. Sutro's case. That one is con
genial surroundings. He Is now con
fined to one room, and is to all intents
and purposes a prisoner. He is kept
under lock and key, and at times begs
piteously for the freedom he so long
enjoyed.
"His near relatives are permitted to
visit him, but other personal friends
are rigidly excluded. Mr. Sutro recog
nizes this, and is worried by It. He is
not confined to his bed continuously, at
times being able to be about for ex
tended periods. We do not claim that
he is strong and vigorous, as we know
â¢ that if such were the case it would
take more than locks and bolts to keep
him in confinement.
"In his rational moments he is great
ly distressed at his inability to find fa
miliar objects. He worries at the sup
posed loss of his two light overcoats;
of books and treasures, to which he
was accustomed, and to his gold watch.
This has been replaced by a cheap
affair that does not keep time. He is
continually asking for his favorite
man-servant 'Tom' and complaining
about the two women nurses in whose
charge he has been placed.
"Mr X Sutro is not the aged man he
has bT*n pictured to be. He was born
on April 29, 1830, making him now In
his sixty-ninth year. It has been stated
repeatedly that he was over 80 years
of age, which is untrue.

we are all united in the desire to see
him returned to the heights overlook
ing the Pacific Ocean. We feel that
there among the flowers and trees he
loved so dearly that his days would
be prolonged. It is repulsive to thtak
that a man of his temperament, accus
tomed to spending the major portion of
the day in the fresh air, should be
cooped up in one room, no matter how
elaborately it be furnished.
"We are supported In these views by
people ail over the world. The Heights
and their owner were so well known
that people thousands of miles from
here have taken an interest in the mat
ter and deplore Mr. Sutro's banishment.
The Heights do not seem, the same now
with the master away. He was so
closely identified with the beautiful
place that even casual, as well as regu
lar, visitors note his absence.
"I". '.Brans a pity that the splendid
summer ate are slipping away one by
one and he no* able to enjoy them. The
harsh days of winter are coming on
apace, when but few opportunities
would be presented for being out of
doors. v^^
"This supplies a line of argument for
his guardian in her opposition to his
removal. She fears that were he per
mitted the freedom of the grounds that
he would not want to go indoors at the
proper time, and the forcing him to do
so against his will would work great in
jury. Again, she fears a sudden turn
of his case for the worst, when a physi
cian should be promptly at hand to re
lieve his sufferings. These attacks do
not come often, however, and as they
give premonitory signs of their coming
they should be easy to provide against.
She also fears that he may become vio
lent suddenly, yet there should be no
danger on that score, as the servants
should have no difficulty in taking care
of him.
"We all feel that it is a marked in
justice that he is not permitted to
spend his last days in his own home
and among his own people,. Dr. Mer
ritt is doing all she can for his physical
comfort, but we feel that he needs the
familiar surroundings of his rooms at
the Heights more than he requires
medicine."
Charles Sutro is reticent regarding
the plans for the restoration of his
father to his former condition. He
fears that their publication would de
feat the very ends they are expected
to serve. Papers in the suit will be
filed at once and the struggle will then
be on.
A prominent physician is authority
for the statement that there are excel
lent grounds for believing that if Mr.
Sutro be allowed to go back among the
flowers and familiar surroundings of
his home he will recover his facul
ties. Mr. Sutro, himself, realizes this
and has so expressed himself to friends.
The very surroundings tend to retard
his mental recovery as they would in
time break down the strongest will.
This is particularly so when the pa
tient is cognizant of the facts in the
case. In this instance it is thought that
if he be permitted to exercise his full
rights he will not approve of steps
that have b^en taken in regard to the
management of his property.
LEES MUST GIVE
UP HAYNES' GOLD
JUDGMENT AGAINST THE BE-
SPANGLED CHIEF.
Judge Hunt Decides That a Man Can
not Take and Keep That Which
Is Not His.
If the heart of chief Lees broke yester
day when he was ordered to give up the
coin he took from the home of the mur
derer Haynes, the slayer of Lieutenant
Burke, the report of the fracture was not
greatâ perhaps about In keeping with the
size of that organ, which so many are
of the opinion does not exist.
That 't broke, however, is a 16 to 1 bet,
for the reason that he had to give up
the money.
But the childish old man will have to
give It up, nevertheless, even though the
damage to his withering anatomy ex
tend beyond the region of his heart, a
region that occupies but a small portion
of the cavity beneath his ribs, and In
flame beyond relief the region in his head
wherein dwells hlB appetite for gold
Judge Hunt filed h!s opinion and held
that the bespangled Chief could not le
gally hold the money discovered in the
abode of Haynes.
When the murderer went to trial he
was defended by Attorneys J. N. E. Wil
son and Edward Sweeney. When judg
ment was pronounced and Haynes was
condemned to spend his life in prison the
aged murderer repudiated his counsel and
refused to pay them. In consequence
Wilson and Sweeney attached the money.
They bumped up against Lees' greed
however. He held the gold and would
not surrender it. So suit was brought
to recover It.
The case was submitted and yesterday
it was decided that the attachment was
legal and Lees must surrender. He may
take the case to the Bupreme Court, but
if he does it will avail him not. The gold
to Lees is gone forever.
In the Divorce Courts.
Delia Lang was granted a divorce from
her husband, E. W. Lang, yesterday, on
the ground of extreme cruelty. Mrs. Lang
alleges that shortly after her marriage
her husband commenced to treat her in
a cruel manner, which he kept up until
she was obliged to leave him. Jeremiah
\\. Sullivan was granted a divorce from
his wife, Mary Sullivan, on the ground of
intemperance. The custody of six minor
children was awarded the plaintiff.
Assaulted at Sea.
Juan Gomez, a sailor on the Occidental,

"We glory in the r act '-. that our present

ity <in both houses ' of i Congress. Though

'â 'â  *i ln " conducting ; the â  war the I. President
has had i and will have : until its ; close ' the
constant support of the Democratic mem
bers ?of s Congress s and the v Democratic
soldiers and sailors. We rejoice that the ,
unification of our country and the oblit
eration of sectional feeling have in the
face of foreign menace been demon
strated to be accomplished facts. Hap
pily there Is no war issue before us in
this election. As Americans we . are
proud to feel that all parties. are support
ing the Government with a loyalty and
enthusiasm that prove to | the world the
undivided patriotism of our people and
their impregnable devotion to the Union.
Nevertheless, glory in the achievements
of our gallant soldiers and sailors and
the heroic passions that foreign wars
very properly engender must not be al
lowed to , obscure â  the â¢ grave domestic
problems which so â  nearly concern the
material welfare and political advance
ment of our commonwealth.
Economy in the administration of State
affairs .is to the people the most vital
of issues. The nominees of the Demo
cratic State Convention will be a suffi
cient guarantee that its pledges will be
redeemed. - . â  ;
Our opponents falsely claim â  that the
Southern Pacific Company, which owns
and directs their political organization is
out of politics. It Is the mission and
duty of the Democratic party of Cali
fornia to continue its unswerving 'oppo
sition to the unjust charges of that cor
poration, to its corrupting influences in
the halls of legislation and the. courts of
justice, to its dishonest efforts to escape
its just obligations to the National Gov
ernment -by refunding schemes, and to
the perpetuation of its monopolistic dom
ination over the industries of California.
Our , candidates must personify these
principles. They must stand for the lib
erty of industry in all Its branches and
the emancipation of the State from the
grasp of corporations, whose confeder
ated wealth threatens not only to absorb
the substance of the people, but even to
annihilate their liberties. In this view
our slogan must be fair treatment for our
producers and : merchants from the rail
road companies within the State and
close and cheap connection with the rest
of our country and the world by the
early construction of the Nicaragua canal
under Governmental ownership and oper
ation. â¢ â 
With full confidence In the principles of
the Democratic party as promulgated by
Thomas Jefferson and as enunciated in
the Democratic national . platform of 1596
we urge " a united :â  Democracy to active
and earnest effort in the discharge of
their -party obligations to the end that
the problems of State importance as well
as the great national and international
questions necessarily consequent upon the
' war with Spain may be solved In the In
terest of the masses c of the people and
the perpetuation , of American principles
of ." b r frty, equality and self-government.
