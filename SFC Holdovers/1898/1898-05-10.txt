FOR THE SPANISH FLEET
Admiral Sampson's Fighting Ships, the New York Leading.
AMERICAN ARMY TO
BE LANDED IN CUBA
BY SUNDAY NEXT
First Detachment of a Force of Sixty-One Thousand
Men Will Soon Be Marching Upon
Havana.
NEW YORK, May 9.â The B.er
ild's Washing-ton correspondent tele
graphs: All necessary preparations
were made to-day in the War Depart
ment to send an army, consisting of
both volunteers and regulars, of over
31,000 men to invade Cuba.
The first detachment of this army
arill be in Cuba by Sunday next and
Kdll immediately establish a base of
supplies for United States troops.
The entire policy of the adminis
tration has been changed since the
day the news of Admiral Dewey's
[*reat victory reached Washington.
From a defensive plan of operation
the Government has now taken a
tnost aggressive stand. In the Cabi
net meeting to-day final arrange
ments were made which it is hoped
will culminate in the capture by the
United States army and navy of all
the Spanish possessions. It was de-
Mded by the President and his Cabi
net that it would be much better to
await a report from Admiral Samp
son before the grand invasion of
Cuba was begun. I am informed
:hat the administration fully expects
:o receive a definite report from Ad
miral Sampson by Thursday of this
;veek, and it is hoped that in this re
port the danger hitherto experienced
Prom the Spanish armada will be en
tirely eliminated. As soon as this
report is received at the Navy De
partment orders will be immediately
sent to General Shafter, commanding
the regular army at Tumpa, Fla., to
nove at once upon Cuban soil.
When the regular army has de
parted from Tampa orders will be
sent to 45.000 volunteer troops
which are to be this week mobilized
at Cbickamauga to at once advance
tn three divisions to Tampa, Mobile
md New Orleans.
It is believed General Shafter and
xiÂ» army -will be able in one short
; and decisive engagement to capture
a base of supplies and to force a
junction with the army of General
Gomez. Captain Dorst, whj has just
returned to the United States from
I Cuba, has made all necessary prepa
rations in regard to such a juncture
between United States troops and
| their Cuban allies. General Gomez
I has at present complete knowledge
j of the military plans of the United
I States and he is gathering his army
j preparatory to joining the first force
of United States regulars.
General Shafter, as soon as his
first work has been accomplished,
will immediately send a report to the
War Department and orders will be
sent by Secretary Alger to General
Wade, who will be in command of
45,000 troops concentrated at Tam
pa, Mobile and New Orleans, to at
once begin the transportation of his
army to join the command of Gen
eral Shafter. Preparations for hav
ing a sufficient number of transports
on hand at these three points are be
ing rushed by the quartermaster
general of the army. Not the slight
est difficulty is expected from this
source.
The entire ?nvading army after
concentration in Cuba will be divided
into three corps, commanded re
spectively by Major-General Wade,
Major-General Coppinger and Major-
General Shafter. Owing to the strong
desire which has been expressed by
General Miles to be commander in
chief of the army actively engaged in
Cuba, he and his entire staff will be
at the head of the army when the
attack on Havana is begun. General
Wade, being the senior major-general
of the three corps commanders, will
rank as second in command.
I am also assured that General
Fitzhugh Lee, at his own most urg
ent request, will be in command of a
The San Francisco Call
division of the Cuban army. Fight-
ing Joe Wheeler will in all proba
bility be in command of the cavalry
in Cuba.
So anxious is the War Department
to expedite the movements of tne in
vading army that it will not wait
for the volunteer army to be fully
equipped with the regulation uni
form. Those troops already sup
plied with uniforms from their na
tional guard service will be expected
to use the same while in Cuba. In
case a regiment lacks the necessary
equipment it will be supplied by the
quartermaster's department with
plain blue blouses. These will con
stitute their uniforms.
The Government has already pro
vided all necessary weapons and arn
miinition for those volunteer troops
not already equipped. No difficulty
will be experienced in this regard.
LONG'S INSTRUCTIONS
TO COMMODORE DEWEY.
Remarkable for Their Terseness,
Conciseness and Compre
hensiveness.
WASHINGTON. May 9.â lt has been
known for Rome time to a few people
in the administration circles and at the
Navy Department that the orders sent
'to Admiral Dewey under which he
made the attack on Manila were re
markable for terseness, conciseness and
comprehensiveness. Efforts to secure
the text of the order have been un
availing up to to-day, when the Presi
dent referred to it in a message sent to
Congress by him relative to the thanks
to Dewey. This made it proper to be
published as part of the record under
which Congress was to proceed. This
is the text of the order:
WASHINGTON, April 24.
Dewey, Hongkong, China: War has
commenced between Spain and the United
States. Proceed at oneÂ« to Philippine
Islands. Commence operations at once,
particularly against the Spanish fleet.
You must capture vessels or destroy
them. Use utmost endeavors.

SAN FRANCISCO, TUESDAY, MAY 10, 1898.
EXPECTS TO
ENGAGE IT IN
ANOTHER DAY
TORPEDO-BOAT
WINSLOW FIGHTS
THREE WARSHIPS
Small American Craft Puts to
Flight Spanish Gunboats After
a Spirited Encounter.
KEY WEST, Fla., May 9.â There waa
rejoicing here to-night when the dis
patch-boat brought news of an en
counter that took place off Cardenas
Bay yesterday afternoon between the
torpedo-boat Winslow and three Span
ish gunboats, in which one of the gun
boats was apparently disabled and all
were put to flight.
The Winslow was steaming In with
that in her demeanor that hinted that
she had no Intention of stopping right
away. There was agitation in the sig
nal station, and in a short time flaga
fluttering hysterically spread the mes
sage that the American vessel was
nearly to the range buoy.
Three gunboats slipped their cables
and ran bravely out to their safety
limit. Every Spaniard aboard expected
to see the American blown out of the
water. Three 6-pounders crackled and
three shells threw waterspouts about
the Winslow, but she was not struck.
The Winplow drove straight ahead,
attacking the boats. Lieutenant Ber
nadou no sooner saw the first white
smokopuffs from the Spanish guns than
he gave the word to the men already
stationed at the two forward one
pounders, which barked viciously and
flotilla.
On plunged the Winslow to within
1500 yards of the gunboats, while the
row raised by the rapid-fire one
pounders was like a rattling tattoo.
The Spaniards were apparently stag
gered at this fierce onslaught, single
handed, and fired wildly on seeing their
pretty plan all gone wrong. The Wins
low now swung around broadside to
bring her two after-guns to bear as
the Spanish fleet scattered, and lost
their formation.
The Winslow soon maneuvered so
that she was -"npertng at all threu
gunboats at once. The sea was very
heavy, and the knifelike torpedo rolled
so wildly that it was impossible to do
good gun practice from her decks; but
despite this big handicap, the rapidity
of her fire and remarkable effectiveness
under the circumstances demoralized
all three opponents, which, after tho
Winslow had fired about fifty shells,
began gradually to work backward to
ward the shelter of the harbor.
They were still hammering away with
their 6-pounders, but after the first fire
were wild, and seemed to be vaguely
shooting at the wide, wide world. Sev
eral shells nassed over the Winslow and
one exploded 100 feet astern, but the
others were shorter, considerably off
one side.
At last one pound shell from the
Winslow went fair and true and struck
the hull of the gunboat Pinzon a little
aft of amidships, apparently exploding
on the inside. The Winslow men yelled.
The Pinzon stopped, evidently dis
abled, while, one of her comrades went
to her assistance.
By this time the Spanish boats had
retreated nearly to a position where
they could not be followed because of
mines and torpedoes.
The Pinzon got under way slowly and
limped homeward with the help of a
tow line from her consort*
During this episode the Machias re
turned and when within the two mile
range let fly two 4-inch shells from her
starboard battery which accelerated
the Spanish flight.
The Winslow's crew was indignant
at this interruption of their sport, and
one of the gunners said to Ensign Bag
ley:
"Signal the Machias to clear out, sir,
and let us have a show."
But the flotilla managed to creep
back into Cardenas harbor in safety.
MADRID, May 9.â An official dis
patch from Havana asserts that an
American cruiser and a large torpedo
boat attempted to force the Cardenas
channel and opened fire on the Span
ish gunboats Antonio Lopez, Ligra and
Alerta. After a half-hour's engage
ment the American warships, the dis
patch says, were "forced to retreat."
Hempmill Destroyed.
GRIDLEY, May 9.â The large hempmill
belonging to John Heanev on Feather
River, three miles northeast of here,
caught fire to-da- from a hot journal.
The mill waa burned and $4000 worth of
hemp in bales waa destroyed. The entire
loss will reach $3000.
Officials Are All Confident
of Victoryâ The Ore
gon's Danger.
NEW YORK, May o â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
Having definite information that the
Spanish fleet which left St. Vincent ten
days ago is not at the Canaries or at
Cadiz, the authorities confidently pre
dict that Rear- Admiral Sampson will
engage it in battle within the next
forty-eight hours. In this event the
battle will occur in the vicinity of San
Juan.
There are two other points at which
the enemy may first make its appear
ance _j n the track of the battle-ship
Oregon and her consorts, the gunboat
Marietta and the cruiser Nicthc-oy,
which arrived to-day at Bahia. Brazil,
or along the North Atlantic coast .of
the United States. But the necessity
of securing coal will compel it to ulti
mately proceed to its base in Porto
Rico, and there it will fin 1 awaiting it
its fate in the shape of a division of the
North Atlantic squadron under com
mand of Rear-Admiral Sampson.
This has been a day of exciting ru
mors at the Department. It was posi
tively announced at the close of office
hours that there has been no engaee
ment as reported: that the Montgomery
had not been pursued by the Spanish
cruiser Vizcaya. and that consequently
Rear-Admiral Samnron's fleet and none
of its members had been destroyed.
That startling news is expected mo
mentarily is shown by the tension ex
isting in official circles. Confident that
Rear-Admiral Sampson with the force
at his disposal will be able to crush the
Spanish squadron, the Naval War
Board, which was in session to-day.
did not concern itself so much with his
movements as with r plan to be adopt
ed to secure the safety of the battle-ship
Oregon and the vessels accompanying
her. As soon as the announcement of
the arrival of the battle-ship at Bahia.
Brazil, was received at the Department
from Captain Clarke, her commanding
officer, the matter was at once referred
to the board, and as the result of its
deliberations there is reason to believe
that instructions have been sent to Cap
tain Clarke for his observance. The
board for the first time was assisted in
its deliberations by Captain A. T. Ma
han, retired, who reported to Secretary
Long this morning and was immediatey
assigned to duty with the board.
What instructions have been given
to Captain Clarke it is impossible to
learn. In any event the neutrality pro
claimed by Brazil will only permit of
his stay in Brazilian waters until to
morrow, when he will resume his iour
ney north. It is highly -robable that
the Oregon will not touch at any other
Brazilian ports, but will proceed at
once to join Rear-Admiral Sampson's
fleet, while the Marie*** and the Nic
theroy will continue to Key West or
Norfolk.
From to-morrow on the Oregon and
her consorts will be in grave danger.
If lying in wait for the American men
of-war it is bcileved that the Spanish
ships will station themselves under the
lee of the island of Fernando No
ronha, to "the eastward of Cape San
Rogue. and from there* conduct their
operations. It was recalled to-day that
Rear-Admiral J. C. Walker, retired,
when a member of the War Board,
strenuously urged that a force be sent,
to join the Oregon, but his advice was
not accepted.
The official view to-night is that the
Spanish fleet is at some point in the
Windward Islands, which are to the
south of Porto Rico. If that be so
their presence will shortly be reported
by the American scouts which are pa

trolling along the decree of latitude to
the northward of the Barbadoes.
It was pointed out to me to-day that
ten days have elansed since the fleet left
St. Vincent, and, going at the rate of
ten knots an hour, they should by this
time have covered the distance to San
Juan.
Another official with whom I talked
called my attention to the fact that when
the Vizcaya and theAlmirante Oquendo
! sailed for the Cape Verde Islands from
j San Juan they left the latter port on
April 8 and did not reach their destina
tion until April 22. It was possible.
I this expert thought, that the Spanish
I fleet on its voyage to San Juan might
I consume an equal period. In this event
the American and Spanish fleets will
not sight each other before Thursday or
Friday.
It is considered highly probable in
naval circles that the Spanish fleet
may find re-enforcements awaiting it at
the Windward Islands. Just before the
blockade of Cuba was inaugurated it
was estimated from official reports that
there were sixty-five Spanish men-of
war in Cuban and Porto Rican waters.
Of these vessels but seven outside of the
cruisers are considered worthy of at
tention. These are torpedo-gun vessels
and torpedo-boats which fled from Cu
ban waters before the blockade com
fnenced. The Depar nent has been ad
vised of the presence of Spanish vessels
in the West Indies from time to time,
and it has been h"'iÂ«^-Â«d that these were
ships that escaped from Cuba. It mar
be that they are under instructions to
join the Cape Verde squadron and will
accompany it to San Juan.
So far as can be learned, however,
the programme hitherto given in the
Herald of permitting the Spanish fleet
to enter San Juan, where it will be kept
bottled up, has not been changed, nor
will it be unless circumstances should
arise dictating other action.
On account of the accuracy with
which the newspapers have been outlin
ing the naval plans of the campaign, the
Department issued to-day this official
order:
"In accordance with the recommenda
tion of the Naval War Board all offi
cers and employes of the Navy Depart
ment are hereby forbidden to furnish
information as to matters pertaining or
bearing upon the conduct of the war to
any person or persons not connected
with the Department, or to any news
paper or other publication, unless au
thorized to do so by the Department."

WASHINGTON, May 9.â Editor New York Herald: In con

it an exceptionally graphic account of the naval engage

the Record was imposed upon and lied

Be Supplied at the
Islands.
The Administration Is Now
Eagerly Pressing the An
nexation Proposition.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, May 9.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
Every ton of coal at the Hawaiian
Islands suitable for steamer use has
been bought for the navy of the Unit
ed States. Orders have been issued
frpm the Navy Department to dispatch
at once colliers to Honolulu loaded
with more coal, and that point is to
be made the most important coaling
station in the entire Pacific Ocean.
It is foreseen by the administration
that there will have to be constant
passing back and forth between the
Pacific Coast and Manila of naval
vessels, transports and supply ships,
and it is absolutely necessary that
these vessels should take on coal at
Honolulu, as few of them can steam
the entire distance from San Fran
cisco to Manila without recoaling en
route.
It is well understood by the adminis
tration that the Hawaiian Government
will make no objection to the United
States naval vessels and transports
coaling at Honolulu, though it is real
ized that by taking that course the
Hawaiian Government takes all re
sponsibility of becoming an ally of the
United States in the war with Spain.
It is realized that if Spain had suffi
cient force in the Pacific the Ha
waiian Islands would be attacked. It
is further realized that, after having
allowed the United States to use Hono
lulu as a coaling station in the present
war, if this Government should become
involved in hostilities with any other
power having naval forces in the Pa
cific, that power would take posession
of the Hawaiian Islands at once.
In view of these facts the adminis
tration is hopeful that the annexation
of Hawaii to the United States will be
accomplished without delay, by ratifi
cation of the pending treaty by the
Senate or by the passage of a Joint
resolution.
The House Committee on Foreign
Affairs will to-morrow resume consid
eration of Newlands' resolution for the
annexation of the islands, and there
Is little doubt that it will be favorably
reported to the House, where it will re
ceive early consideration and probably
be agreed to on Thursday. It is sug
gested that the House take no action
in regard to annexation until after the
Senate had exhausted all its resources
by voting on the annexation treaty.
As, however, there is no possibility of
a two-thirds vote for the treaty being
secured in the Senate, it is not prob
able that there will be any delay on
this account.
Additional impetus may be given the
movement for immediate annexation
to-morrow by an official offer from
Hawaii for a transfer of the islands
to the United States for the purposes
of the war with Spain. It was announced
in a press dispatch some days ago that
President Dole had sent a communi
cation to this Government making such
an offer. Mr. Hatch did not receive
anything by telegraph from San Fran
cisco relating to such an offer, but mail
which arrived by the steamer which
brought the press dispatch to San
Francisco reached Washington to-day.
As the Minister was absent in JJew
York, this mail will not be opened until
his return to-morrow, when, if it con
tains an offer from President Dole to
transfer the islands to the United
States, it will be at once communicated
to the State Department.
The first use of Honolulu as a coaling
and supply station will be made by the
cruiser Charleston and the supply
ships which she is to convoy to Manila.
This expedition is to start from San
Francisco next week and the adminis
tration will be glad to have the islands
annexed before that expedition starts.

The assignment of one battalion of in

ENCOUNTERED A
TORPEDO-BOAT AT SEA.
Fog Probably Saves the Warren Line
Steamer From Being
Captured.
NEW YORK, May 9.â A Boston
special to the Herald says: The War
ren line steamer Roman, which arrived
from Liverpool this morning, reported
that she encountered a strange war
ship, believed to be a Spanish torpedo
boat, off Sable Island, last Friday.
Captain Roberts, the commander, says
that about noon the second mate re
ported that he had sighted a rakish
craft about four miles off the steamer's
beam. The Roman was then seventy
miles southeast from Sable Island,
about 600 miles due east from Boston.
Captain Roberts made her out to be
a torpedo-boat, sharp and low at both
ends, with two funnels close together.
She had no masts. The weather was
quite hazy, and it was impossible to
discern the color of her hull. She
showed no flag, evidently endeavoring
to conceal her nationality. She was
steaming at the rate of twelve knots
an hour, about the same speed as the
Roman, and continued in the same di
rection for fully half an hour after she
was sighted by the Roman's second of
ficer, apparently gaining slightly on
the Roman. A thick fog v then settled
over the ocean and the torpedo-boat
was lost to view. Pilot Lawler, who
brought in the Roman, notified Cap
tain Sands of the Co-lumbia, and he
sent one of his lieutenants to the Ro
man for full particulars to report to
Washington.

ST. THOMAS, D. W. 1., May 9.â A
four-masted Spanish cruiser bore down
upon the Herald-Call dispatch steamer
about ten miles from San Juan, Porto
Rico, to-day. We were going south
and when our signals were displayed
she turned eastward, steaming off at a
rate of about sixteen knots. The aux
iliary cruiser Yale, a hich was hovering
in the distance, followed her for about
two hours. She was last seen in Vir
gin passage.
The Spanish cruiser Isabella II
touched at the cable station at St.
Thomas early in the morning and after
communicating with the Spanish Con
sul sailed away to the westward, prob

ships on the south coa,st of Porto Rico.
The Yale has circled the island, but
has not seen another American war
ship since she left the United States.
Lieutenant Key boarded the Herald-

news of the Spanish fleet, which is ex
pected to arrive here at any hour.
St. Thomas is wild with excitement.
A light was seen outside the harbor at
midnight last night, which was believed
to be that of a warship. The Herald-

THE SA^ FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 10, 1898.
CUBANS
NEED FOOD
AND GUNS
But Gomez Does Not Want
Any American Troops
Landed.
Copyrighted. 1898. by James Gordon Bennett
KEY WEST, Fla., May 9.â At last
the Herald Is able to give its readers
and the Government reliable Informa
tion regarding the condition and situa
tion of General Gomez and other Insur
gent forces in Cuba. A Herald repre
sentative, Fred O. Somerford, arrived
at Key West last night, having just
come, after a journey attended with
great peril, from the headquarters of
Gomez. He left the Cuban general
May 4, and was the last American to
converse with the insurgent leader.
For more than two months he has
been either with Gomez or other insur
gent chiefs. He left Havana March 3,
commissioned by the Herald to make
his way into the interior, visit all the
insurgent camps, talk with the leaders
and learn from actual observation the
real conditions, and he has done it. He
was "peculiarly fitted for his task, as he
has been a resident of Cuba for sev
eral years and speaks the language
fluently. Until the Cuban insurrection
broke out he was engaged in commer
cial pursuits on the island. Suspected
by Weyler of sympathy with the insur
gents, the Spanish troops destroyed his
property and remuneration was re
fused, although he is an American citi
zen. Since May, 1897, he has been a
greater part of the time with the in-
surgents. OCAA
"The Insurgents have now about ibW
men in the vicinity of Gomez's camp,
that is, within a radius of thirty miles,
said Somerford. "The best troops east
of Jucaro Moron trocha are the di
vision commanded by General Gon
zales. He has 800 infantry, who ar*
well armed and well disciplined. One
company is armed with Mauser rifles
which were captured from the Spanish.
For these rifles there is but a small
supply of ammunition. The other com
panies are armed with the long Rera.
ington which throws a bullet of 43 cal
iber. This is a weapon in common use
among the insurgents. They prefer it
to the Mauser in spite of the latter's
repeating property. Gomez's immedi
ate command consists of a body guard
of 150 cavalry and seventy-five infan
try, under command of Major Joseph
Desrampes. Desrampes is an Ameri
can from New Orleans and a good ar
tillerist. This force of 3500 is all that
are in fighting sh*^e just at present,
but if there were arms and equipments
it could be swelled to probably 30,000.
Gomez told me he wanted 40,000 guns to
equip an army large enough to drive
the Spaniards from the Island. He
wants long Remingtons or Springflelds
for the infantry and carbines of the
same character for the cavalry.
â¢â Garcia's force in Santiago de Cuba
is all infantry. In reorganization they
should be compelled to remain infantry.
They are drilled as such, and, never
having had horses, are accustomed to
make long marches on foot. I know
Gomez wants to unite Garcia's forces
with his own, although Gomez did not
tell me this himself. I am told the man
never makes his plans known when he
can help it. My information, however,
comes from the inside. Gomez regards
artillery as very important, but the
Cubans have none. They have the
greatest contempt for the Spanish ar
tillerymen and assert that not a Cuban
has been injured in the entire war by
the Spanish field pieces.
"The question of food and supplies ia
an important one to be considered in
any plan contemplating the utilizing of

LAST APPEAL TO
WATER COMPANY
Los Angeles Council Takes
Tardy Action in Dealing
With the City's Octopus.
Again Demands m. Complete List of
Improvements to the Distrib
uting Plant.
Special DiÃDatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, May 9.â When less
than ninety days remain in which the
city of Los Angeles may consummate the
purchase of the improvements of the
water company to the municipal dis
tributing plant and get possession prior
to the expiration of the lease the Coun
cilmen pretend to get exercised.
This afternoon Councilman Nlckell,
chairman of the water supply committee,
presented a resolution in which reference
was made to the communication of the
council some time ago asking for a full
and complete statement of the water
company's improvements and by whom
owned. _j
It refers to the incompleteness of the
reply. It then demands that the com
pany make a full and complete state
ment of all improvements which the
company expects the city to pay forâ
pipes, mains, reservoirs, pumping plants,
machinery, rights of way, property, etc.,
all itemized and indicated by specific
reference to maps, diagrams, etc.; also
what rights and property are held by the
Crystal Springs Company, which the city
is expected to purchase, and by what
process and where there exists a record
of the transfers of Interests to the suc
cessors of Griffin, Beaudry and Lazard.
The resolution concluded as follows:
Resolved, further, that said successors In
the Interest of said Griffin. Beaudry and LaÂ«
ard be. and they are hereby requested to fur
nish forthwith to this Council a particular de
scription of lands, rights of way, waters and

the uses' in connection with supplying water
to the inhabitants of the city for domestic pur
poses, and which property Is claimed by the
Los Angeles City Water Company not to be
improvements within the meaning of the con
tract.
The City Attorney was directed to
serve a copy of the resolutions on the
water company.
NOTED CIVILIANS TO
GET STAFF POSITIONS.
John Jacob Astor Among the Army
Officers Nominated by the
President.
WASHINGTON, May 9.â Many of
the civilians appointed to the army
staff positions are quite well known.
John Jacob Aastor is one of the wealth
iest men In the United States. Curtis
Guild is editor of the Boston Commer
cial; Walter I. Bouve 1b captain of the
Cuban army of any strength cannot be
mobilized until after food for it has
been furnished by the United States.
Gomez cannot mobilize even such
forces as he has until food supplies
have been sent into the island by the
United States to say nothing- of an
army of any considerable size mobil
ized. His army would starve even if
not crushed by Blanco.
"Gomez is a wily old man, and, I
think, not without future political as
pirations in the government which will
be formed at the close of the war. He
does not want the United States to land
an army in Cuba, except it be a regi
ment of artillery to co-operate in con
junction with him. Gomez knows that
an American army will defeat Blanco,
take Havana and practically end th^
war in a month after it lands on Cuban
soil.
"On the other hand, if he can per
suade the administration at Washing
ton that it is dangerous to land United
States troops in Cuba during the sum
mer and that he can defeat Blanco If
provided with arms, ammunition and
provisions, the future is bright with an
augmented reputation for him. As a
victorious general Gomez may ask and
obtain any honor that free Cuba has
to bestow.
"In the party which left Gomez' camp
a few days before I did was William D.
Smith. We came into Key West to
gether. Smith is the hearer of sealed
communications from Gomez to Gen
eral Quesada. T. Estrada Palma, Presi
dent McKinley and General Miles. In
these letters Gomez urges the President
and General Miles not to attempt to
land any United States troops in Cuba
during the summer, stating that a
great loss of life from disease would
result. Gomez also assures the Presi
dent that if provided with arms and
food, with the co-operation of the
blockade, he ran easily defeat Blanco
and take Havana without a single
American exposing his life to the ray- I
ages of yellow fever and smallpox.
"I suppose these communications will |
be regarded at Washington as en
titled to great consideration. In my
opinion a policy based on these recom
mendations of Gomez would rise like
a ghost to confront the American peo
ple afterward. If Gomez really believes
that he can deal with Blanco and end i
the war he is mistaken. It will be |
months, even under the most favorable !
conditions, before Gomez can put an I
army in the field capable of meeting !
Blanco in open battle and defeating j
him. Even the veterans of Gomez* and
Garcia's division are not good soldiers, |
as Americans reckon soldiers. They are
good guerrillas, but have no knowledge
of real military service. Forty thou
sand troops from the United States are
enough to annihilate Blanco's army
and take Havana, and three-fourths of
them can return after a campaign of a
month.
"The Spanish soldiers will fight. They
remind me of a pack of mules. As long
as they are fed they can be driven
Their officers literally drive them into
battle, generally taking a position bo
hind the troops to urge them on They
are enduring and will stand hard treat
ment.
Somerford brings news that a few days
ago Blanco telegraphed the Spanish
fleet in the Philippine waters had won a

fleetln the Philippine waters had won a
great victory. The officers prepared to

After Numerous En

by the Troops.
Corpses Piled in Doorwiys to Await
the Arrival of Military
Wagons.
Bpecia! Dispatch to The Call.
LUGANO, Switzerland, May 9.âAc
cording to the latest news received here
from Milan, Italy, the rising of the peo
ple there seems to have been mastered.
Re-enforcements of troops poured into
the city all night long. Trouble has
occurred at Treviso, Verona, Padua
and Brescia.
There was a renewal of the disturb
ances at Milan last night due to the ar
rival of a mob of students from Pavia
armetl with revolvers. They attempted
to force an entrance into the city, but
were repulsed by a detachment of Ber
saglieri, who killed two of the students
and wounded four. In the parts of
Milan where the resistance was most
desperate whole streets were torn up
by the mob. faot a pane of glass Is
unbroken, doors are torn down, and on
all sides can be seen the remains of
fires and wrecked furniture and other
household goods. In fact, those por
tions of the city are practically sacked.
The bodies of the killed were first piled
in doorways and were afterward col
lected by army wagons. The hospitals,
permanent and temporary, are over
flowing with injured people.
It is announced that work was re
sumed this morning in the factories of
Milan.
At Genzano, near Rome, the troops
fired on a mob which was engaged in
looting. Two persons were killed and
many wounded.
A mob gathered at Pontedora, thir
teen miles from Pisa, and marched on
the town hall, demanding bread or
work. They stoned the building and
refused to disperse when ordered to do
so. The troops fired a volley and killed
three persons. A number were also in
jured.
ROME, May 9.â A dispatch was re
ceived by the Premier, the Marquis di
Rudini, this afternoon, from Lieuten
ant Bava-Brecaris, commanding the
Third Army Corps, with headquarters
at Milan, where the most serious riot
ing has occurred, saying all was quiet
there to-day, and adding that the
stores were reopening.
Signor Turali and Signor Hissolate,
Socialist Deputies, have been arrested
at Milan.
There have been slight disorders to
day at Bologma, Verona, Padua and
Tropea. According to the latest re
ports from Milan the situation there is
still grave. Streetcar traffic has been
stopped and the railway men have
struck. The stoppage of trains pre
vents information as to actual occur
rences inside the town, but the Brian za
peasants, armed with hay forks, are
hastening to assist the Milan strikers.
LONDON, May 10.â A Milan corre
spondent of the Daily News, telegraph
ing Monday, says: Calm reigns again,
This being so, it can do no harm to
say plainly, though it is by no means
certain the words will reach you, that
for the last two days this city has been
in the throes of revolution, with all its
horrors and all its sadness.
Certan quarters to-day present a
scene of complete devastation. In
others, the quietness of terrorism
reigns, and this is the more striking
when contrasted in the mind of the
spectator with the scenes of yesterday
and Saturday, when, above the shrieks
of the dying, arose the wails of widows
and orphans, the hoarse words of com
mand and the irresistible tramp of
soldiers, followed by the terrible boom
of cannon.
When the fury first broke out, many
of the people who would have nothing
to do with the movement were caught,
as it were, in a trap. Here is an in
stance: When the soldiers were adÂ»
vancing to the charge against the first
barricade in the Via Torino, a lady,
young; richly dressed and filled with
terror, was struck by a bullet In the
breast and fell dying.
A very noticeable point throughout
the two days' fighting has been that
the workingmen element, although
without adequate means of offensive or
defensive, has shown, extraordinary
tactical knowledge, a proof among oth
ers that, organization existed and prep
arations had been made, perhaps not
for an explosion now, but at the first
opportunity. Thirteen barricades were
built by the mob at the Cordo Gari
baldi, where this main street is inter
sected by others, forming a small
square. Thus the people were the mas
ters of the ground, which they held
for a long- time before the Bersaglieri.
by acts of real heroism, succeeded in
penetrating the barricades.
Even the gentle nuns of San Mich
aele were for a time in grave danger,
as the rebels were not likely to respect
women. A barricade has been raised
beside the convent and this enraged
the rioters. The savage cry arose:
"Let us use the nuns to heighten our
barricades."
They were on the point of carrying
out the idea when one of the sisters
appeared at the convent door and dis
tributed lire notes, enjoining them with
most exquisite courtesy to leave the
convent in peace.
Even this, however, would have been
insufficient had not the cavalry ar
rived, giving the crowd something else
to think of. The mob did not respect
pven the hospitals, but wished to- in
vade them, and the Ospenola Maggiore
was threatened. Behind the gate of
that building stood Professor Porr, a
Senator and weli-known doctor, the
most noted conservative In Milan. The
crowd was quick to see him.
"There is Porr, our oppressor," they
cried, threateningly. Insults were
shouted at the professor, who, now
pale, but calm, resolutely opened the
gates and stood with arms folded, say
ing sternly:
"To him who has the courage, ad
vance. He will find a good revolver
ready for him, and I will Bhow him how
a good physician does his duty."
Nobody accepted the invitation.
It is extremely difficult to speak with
accuracy as to the numbers of killed
and wounded, and any estirtiate, in
view of the conflicting statements cur
rent, can only approximate to the
truth. It may be said at once that the
casualties were many times more
numerous than co-uld at first have been
believed, even by spectators of the
bloodshed. Probably it would not be
exaggerating to fix the number of
deaths as little short of 1000. What are
the numbers of the wounded I shall
not attempt to say. Many casualties
will probably never be known.

MAY KEEP
CONQUERED
ISLANDS
United States Considering
Government for the
Philippines.
At the Cabinet Meeting It Is
Decided to Send Troops
to Assist Dewey.
NEW YORK, May 9.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald sends
the following: Some desultory discus
sion occurred at the Cabinet meeting
to-day as to the character of the gov
ernment that should be given to the
Philippines. The cabinet had been
called together by the President, in ac
cordance with his usual custom, to read
over his message to Congress on the
battle of Manila Bay, and when the
reading was concluded the talk turned
to the establishment of some sort of
government in the islands. A propo
sition was made to form a commission,
consisting of Rear Admiral Dewey,
Consul Wildman at Hongkong and Con
sul Williams, formerly at Manila, who
would administer a government of the
islands, but it was not adopted.
A decision was reached, being to lay
the question aside until the army had
started from San Francisco. The an
nouncement was made upon the conclu
sion of the Cabinet meeting that it had
finally been determined to send rein
forcements to Rear Admiral Dewey.
No coal or naval supplies will be sent
as Rear Admiral Dewey has informed
the department that there is a supply
of coal at Manila capable of lasting for
an indefinite period and he has an am
ple quantity of food supplies for his
fleet. Ammunition will be carried to
him by the cruiser Charleston, which
will convoy the troops to Manila,
Chief Naval Constructor Hichborn
said to-day that in view of the safety
of the American warships instructions
had been given' revoking former orders
for a collection of lumber, plate, steel
and tools, which were to have been
shipped to Manila on board the City of
Peking:. Naval Constructor W. L.
Capps will go as the representative of
the Construction Bureau to gather
what information he can for future
guidance of the Navy Department in
the construction of new men-of-war.
"I expect, of course, that the line of
ficers on board Rear-Admiral Dewey's
i fleet will send such information as they
can secure," said the chief naval con
structor, "but Mr. Capps, I am confi
dent, will be able to obtain information
which will be of great value in the con
struction of future men-of-war and es
pecially of those authorized by the re
cent naval appropriation law."
It has been definitely decided that an
army of 6000 men will be sent under
command of Major-General Merriam to
assist Rear-Admiral Dewey in estab
lishing American sovereignty in the
Philippines. The quartermaster-gen
eral has already made the necessary
arrangements for obtaining transports
for this army. All the steamships of
the Pacific Mail and Panama lines
have been put at the disposal of the
Government, and I am told that the
entire number of ships will be obi
tamed from these companies. The ves
sels are fast and very large.
At the Cabinet meeting to-day ar
rangements were made for the estab
lishment of a provost court at Manila.
This court will consist of one army or
naval officer, who will have complete
jurisdiction over the internal affairs of
the Philippines. No appointments to
thi3 possible position has yet been
made.
In the general orders governing the
volunteer army, issued to-day by the
War Department, these troops were
designated to be mobilized and em
barked at San Francisco for service in
Manila:
California, two regiments of infantry
and two batteries of heavy artillery;
Oregon, one regiment of infantry;
Washington, one regiment of infantry;
Idaho, one regiment of infantry, and
Utah, two batteries of light artillery
and one troop of cavalry. These troops
together with a part of the Third Ar
tillery and four companies of the Four
teenth Infantry will constitute th 6
army for the Philippines.
Keenly alive to the possibility of the
United States transferring the Philip
pines to another power, Europe is
watching with Interest the policy of
this country with respect to their ulti
mate destination. It can be stated on
high diplomatic authority that rather
than the Philir">ines should become the
possession of any other nation, provid
ed they cannot be returned t,o Spain,
Europe as a whole prefers that they
shall remain the property of the Ameri
can Government. In view of the abso
lute neutrality observed by Great Brit
ain, as stated in the Herald, diplomats
here regard it as practically impossible
for the "great powers to reach an agree
ment for the exertion of pressure upon
the Washington Government, as a re
sult of which it will withdraw from
the Eastern islands. Such being the
case, Europe desires that the American
flag shall continue to wave over the
land which Rear Admiral Dewey has
conquered.
I talked to-day with a high State De
partment official who keep's fn close
touch with the President and with
members of the diplomatic corps in re
gard the disposition to be made of the
islands. He said:
"The President's policy with respect
to the Philippines is undefined so far as
their ultimate disposition is concerned.
For the present they are under the con
trol of the military forces of this Gov
ernment, and the status will finally be
determined when the treaty of peace is
signed. One thing is certain, if the
United States does not retain posses
sion of all the islands, it will keep a
coaling station in the far East for the
benefit of American warships and
American commerce. The administra
tion feels that Europe has nothing to
do with the disposition of the conquer
ed islands. I think Europe feels the
same way. Great Britain and Japan
are naturally delighted that the islands
shall have passed into American hands,
but France and Russia do not regard,
the entrance of this Government into
Eastern affairs with satisfaction, and
commercial jealousy causes the Berlin
Government to look at the matter in
much the same way as do Russia and 1
France." -
Spaniards Yet Stubborn.
LONDON, May 10.â A dispatch to the
Daily Mall from Hongkong- says: A
communication from Manila asserts
that the Spaniards are still arrogant
and not likely to surrender until the
city is blown to pieces. A telegraph
operator has gone with the McCulloch
to see what can be done with the cable.
GENERAL NUNEZ'
SUCCESSFUL MISSION.
i Beturns After Landing a Party to
Join the Cuban In-
surgents.
WASHINGTON, May 9.â Major-Ge
neral Nunez of the Cuban army arrived
here last night on his return from
landing a party In Cuba. This land
ing was made about two weeks ago,
after conferences between General Nu
nez, General Miles and Senor Quesada,
the Cuban delegate, and was for the
purpose of opening up communication
with Generals Garcia and Gomez.
After a brief conference with Mr.
Quesada, General Nunez left for New
York, where he will make a report to
President Palma. The results of his
trip are guarded with much care by
the Cuban officials here, who deem it
Inexpedient to discuss what General
Nunez did. It is said, however, that
his party found no difficulty in estab
lishing communication with the Cu
ban commanders in the island. It is
understood that General Nunez will
continue organizing parties of Cubans
to go to the front, and will have com
mand of the United States farces other
wise than those in the field under Gar
cia and Gomez.

Boat Destroyers Will

The Navy Department Will Con

NEW YORK, May 9.â A Washing
ton special to rho Hpraid says: Profit-
Ing by the necessities of the present,
the Navy Department lias practically
determined to build what may be
termed destroyers of torpedo-boat de
stroyers.
Formidable boats of this type will
be constructed under specifications
which are being prepared by the Naval
Board of Bureau chiefs. The naval
appropriation law which was recently
placed on the statute-books author
lzesi besides the construction of three
battlel-ships, four monitors and one
gunboat, sixteen destroyers and
twelve torpedo-boats. Recognizing
that the immediate need of the navy Is
10-boai destroyers, the i^epart
mtlnt has wisely taken steps to begin
the construction of these boats at once,
and the specifications which are being
drawn will insure the addition to the
navy a year and six moi.th". h.'uce of
vessels which will be the finest of
their type in the woild. The displace
ment of the boats is nxed at about 400
tons each. Light steel will be the
structural material employed. Two
quadruple expansion engines, capable
of developing from 10,500 to 11. > in
dicated horsepower, will cause the
twin screws of each boat to revolve at
a rate sufficient to drive it with a
speed of twenty-eight knots per hour.
The engines and boilers are to be
placed in separate compartments so as
to diminish ihe chance of disable
ment by one shot.
In order to further protect the ves

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, May 9.â Alex. C. Brice,
United States Consul at Matanzas, is
in this city with his family. He is
on his way home to Bedford, lowa,
where he will try to forget the scenes
of horror, which, he says, are equaled
by nothing in Dante's "Inferno." There
will be one thing, though, that Mr.
Brlce can never forget. He says he
was forced to leave a hundred citizens
of America in Matanzas. Some of these
have already been slaughtered by the
Spanish, he believes. Others will be,
and many will die of starvation. Mr.
Brice said to-day:
"The condition of some was as bad
as that of the reconcentrados. The
greater portion of them were Cubans
by birth, who had become naturalized
in this country, but some were genuine
blue-blooded Yankees. There were
many women in the number. It was
impossible for them to leave, they not
having money enough even to buy food.
"The Norwegian captain of the ves
sel on which I escaped refused to take
the American citizens. Had It been an
American vessel I would have insisted.
Four or five of the Americans who had
heard I was to depart came down to
the shore. They were deeply affected
and tearfully begged to be taken away.
I told them to take to the bush and
join the insurgents, if they could, and
to advise their friends to do the same.
"I could not sleep that night aboard
the Norwegian vessel. The memory of
those poor Americans and their proba
ble fate was always before me ;as I
tossed in my berth, and at 2 o'clock in
the morning I arose and wrote a mes
sage, which I afterward dispatched to
Washington. I appealed in the name
of heaven for a warship to take off
the Americans who were left behind.
President McKinley tried to save them,

When the Senate Finance Commit
tee adjourned to-night the considera
tion of the war revenue bill had been
j almost completed, although there were
some puzzling problems still unsolved,
| one of which was the manner of deal
ing with proprietary medicinal articles.
There will be probably a uniform tax
on all of them.
The committee has decided to place
a license upon banks at the rate of $100
I a year and upon brokers at the rate of
! $50, but has not yet determined whether
i the professions shall be licensed or not.
! On life insurance companies the rate
: has been increased five fold, being
i made 10 cents on every hundred dol
; lars, and it is estimated that this mi
i crease will add about a million dollars
i in revenue.
The provision for an inheritance tax
and for a tax on bills of lading were
j both adopted, as were the provisions
i for taxing all dealings in futures, ln
: eluding bucket-shop operations. The
| bill, as it will be reported, will contain
J a provision requiring that a memoran
; dum be made of all deals of this charÂ»
: acter, however small, and that a 2
j cent stamp be placed upon this mem

The Democratic amendments will be
j taken up to-morrow and there is very

THE SUPPLY
OF WATER
Plan Suggested by
Dr. Huntington of
Sacramento.
Favors the Construction
of an "Infiltration
Gallery."
System Used Successfully in
Cities of the East and
in Europe.
SIMPLE IN ITS DETAILS.
Would Ramo-va the Danger of a
Epidemic Induced by Present
Conditions.
Bpecl*l Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, May B.â The revela
tions made by The Call in the matter
of the pollution of the water supply of
Sacramento has created general and
widespread agitation upon the subject,
and it is safe to say that the result will
be some action on the part of the au
thorities which will eradicate the evil.
Dr. T. W. Huntington, physician-in
chief of the Southern Pacific Hospital
In this city, has suggested a remedy
which will no doubt receive general
sanction. In an interview with The
Call correspondent the doctor said:
"In the first place, Sacramento Is dif
| ferently situated from hundreds of
I other cities In the United States which
j are compelled to rely for their water
i supply upon running rivers which are
j more or less contaminated. This is also
1 true in regard to almost everything we
eat. Our meat and food stuffs, without
extraordinary care given in their prep
; aration, are by no means free from im
purities. Species of microscopic fungi
can be found on the surface of all
Btanding water, and even in the fruit
we eat, before the decaying stage is
perceptible. There are armies of these
little enemies of health. Thus I say,
when one talks about the impurities of
| our drinking water he has in hand a
j situation as general as the use of water
; itself. Of course the most foul of all
; pollutions are those which include the
sewage from the prison cess pools, pig
sties and stable yards. The man who
â¢ permits his family to use such water
i without a thorough filtration or puri-
J fication by boiling surely permits their
j health and lives to remain in constant
! peril.
"What would be your remedy?" was
| asked.
"As I said before, in whatever shape
the water is introduced into the hy
drants before being used f(,r drinking
purposes it should be boiled, but for an
original step in the direction of pure
water, I believe the only system for
the city is the process of infiltration.
"I would go above the point where
th ! American empties into the Sacra
mento, and st some point available I
would construct what Is known to civil
engineering as an 'Infiltration gallery.'
similar to the one now in use in Lowell,
Mass. The principle lies in the applica
tion of the most simple and natural
plan of clarification. A well, or basin,
or gallery is excavated in the porous
margin of a lake or stream down to a
level below the surface of the water
at its lowest stage. From the stream
there will be a drain into this gallery
and the water will be supplied by in
filtration.
"The volume of water to be obtained
from such a source depends upon the
porosity of tl.e earth gravel between
the wall baoin or gallery and the main
body of the water, the distance between
the river and the gallery, the size of
the latter. -*a the volume of the water
under which the infiltration is main
tai led.
Mayor Land has announced his pur
pose of calling the attention of the City
Board of Trustees and the City Board
of Health to the dangers of the situa
tion, and in all probability 'before the
week is over, some definite plan of ac
tion will be decided upon.

TO RENDER POLLUTED WATER PURE.
Dr. Huntington of Sacramento suggests a feasible remedy for the present situation of Sacramento as regards
absence of a ; pure water supply. It is the : construction of ' an "infiltration gallery," on the lines laid down in the
accompanying, illustration. * '
In the illustration A represents the surface of the water in the Sacramento River; B, the natural formation of

The infiltration is accomplished by the water seeping â  through the sandy soil, and up into the gallery- through
the gravel filter bed. . , T; : V â¢ : V

NEW CHIEF OF THE McCULLOCH
Engineer Chalker, Promoted to Succeed Frank
Randall, Who Died After the Manila Battle.
First Assistant Engineer James H. Chalker of the Corwln Is the first
officer to receive promotion due to a casualty In the war with Spain. By
order of the Navy Department he has received h!s appointment as chief en
gineer by telegram and has been directed to proceed to Manila forthwith and
assume charge of the motive force on Commodore Dewey's dispatch-boat Mc-
Culloch, to act In the place of Chief Engineer Frank Randall, who died on
that vessel after the battle of Manila. Chief Engineer Chalker is a native
of Connecticut, and was born In 1858, appointed a second assistant engineer
in the revenue cutter service In 1878, and commissioned a first assistant
engineer in 1890. His last duty was on the Manning at Boston, and In March
last he was assigned to the Corwin at this port. He Is one of the young
officers of the service and highly proficient in his profession. He was the
recipient of many congratulations yesterday from his brother officers on
the Corwin. His predecessor, Chief Engineer Randall, has for many years
been in bad health, although this did not prevent his applying for assign
ment in Commodore Dewey's fleet, as he desired duty afloat and In action.
Randall was born in New Hampshire and was G8 years old. He entered the
revenue cutter service as a second assistant engineer in 1574, was appointed
a first assistant engineer in 18R3, and commissioned a chief engineer in
1895. His last duty was the fitting out of the McCulloch at Cramps' ship
yard, and he had applied to go with her on her maiden voyage to San
Francisco.
PROMPT INVASION
OF CUBA PLANNED
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, May 9.
An Invasion of Cuba by 50,000 regu
lar and volunteer troops, the destruc
tion of the Spanish fleet if It Is on thlÂ«
side of the Atlantic and the imme
diate capture of San Juan, Porto Rico.
If it is not. These plans are to be put
Into execution at once.
It is freely predicted to-night that
within twenty-four hours news will
come that Admiral Sampson has com
menced to bombard the batteries of
San Juan. A general belief now pre
vails that the Alfonso XIII is the only
Spanish warship in the vicinity of
Porto Rico or on this side of the At
lantic with the exception df the
Alfonso XII, now in Havana harbor.
Therefore, operations will be Immedi
ately begun by Sampson. The Al
fonso XIII will be captured or de
stroyed and the batteries of Porto
Rico reduced before the Spanish fleet
can cross the Atlantic.
It has also been decided that there
shall be no further delay in the mili
tary operations. There will be an in
vasion of Cuba by our regular and
volunteer troops probably within ten
days. It has been decided by the War
Board that it is not necessary to
definitely locate the Spanish vessels,
for Admiral Sampson is able to take
care of them wherever they may be. A
few weeks ago it was decided that only
troops to the number of about 5000
would be sent to Cuba. It was not to
be an invasion, but a mere "landing"
in order to establish a base of supplies
from which subsistence and ammuni
tion could be sent to the insurgents,
who were to do the fighting against
Blanco's forces.
Reliable reports from Havana state
that General Blanco Is abandoning the
interior and mobilizing his troops In
Havana and other ports on the north
ern coast. It would be a perilous
situation for 5000 American troops.
But 50,000, together with the in
surgents, would be able to hold their
ground until Sampson, after taking
Porto Rico, could return to Havana
and bombard the batteries and the
city, while the troops attacked from
the rear.
It is confidently expected that on
Friday next the City of Peking, con
voyed by the Charleston, will sail out
of the Golden Gate with as many
troops as she can carry to Manila,
Supplies shipped from the East on Sat
urday are due to arrive in San Fran
cisco on Thursday morning, and there
now seems to be no reason why the
first expedition to the Philippines
should not sail on the next day.
General B. Tracy's call on the Presi
dent to-day revived the rumor that he
is to be made Military Governor of
the Philippines, and the fact that Gen
eral Tracy would neither affirm nor
deny the correctness of the report, or
discuss it at all, was calculated to
strengthen the belief that the ex-Sec
retary of the Navy will be the first
American Governor of the islands. If
It is not he, General Merriam, com
manding: the Department of California
and the Columbia, will be the man. It
Is regarded as certain that the ap
pointment lies between these two. A
week ago it was thought that General
I.*ee would be made Military Gover
nor, but it is now announced that he
will be given command of the First
Division of Volunteers sent to Cuba.
Mourning at Gilroy.

MAY NOW
ABANDON
HAWAII
A Honolulu Paper Speaks
of Probable Action by
Uncle Sam.
Instead of Being Annexed the
Islands May Be Left to the
Care of Great Britain.
HONOLULU, May I.â According to a
local paper, instead of the Hawaiian
Islands being annexed as a war meas
ure immediately on the outbreak of
hostilities with Spain, the prospect is
that they will virtually be abandoned
by the United States until the war is
over. It Is understood from several
sources of good authority that the
United StateÃ has already asked Great
Britain to dispatch a cruiser to these
islands on the outbreak of the war in
order that United States vessels now
stationed here might be permitted to
return home to do their share in pro
tecting Pacific Coast cities.
It will be remembered that In the
agreement between Great Britain,
France and the United States, one or
the other of the powers has to main
tain a naval* force here for the joint
protection of the citizens of the three
countries in case of revolutionary or
any other trouble on shore. Of late
years, by mutual consent of the three
powers, the duty of caring for these
islands has been left to the United
States for many good reasons. Now
that the latter country has become em
broiled with Spain she has probably
felt justlfled In asking Great Britain
to assume, for the time being, her share
of the care and protection of Hawaii,
and there is no doubt that the latter
power has promptly acceded to the re
quest, the more so as she appears par
ticularly anxious at present to obtain
the good will of the United States. In
the light of recent events a British
cruiser may be looked for in this har
bar in a very few days, and on her ar
rival the Bennington will lose no time
in getting to the coast.
On the 28th the Alameda arrived with
the not altogether unexpected news of
impending war. There was intense
excitement and strong patriotic senti
ment toward the United States ex
pressed, and grave anxiety felt as to
the result of war upon our unprotected
island home, and the stand to be taken
by our Government In the event of ac
tual war.
The Call correspondent promptly
called upon President Dole at the ex
ecutive building. Mr. Dole was evi
dently perturbed at not having re
ceived a telegram from Minister Hatch
or from any one at Washington with
official news later than the newspaper
dispatches, which merely left the con
dition of affairs unsettled, with the war
apparently inevitable. He was strong
ly of the opinion that there was no ne
cessity for the Hawaiian Government
to issue a proclamation of neutrality in
the absence of any definite news as to
the condition of affairs or the actions
or wishes of the United States in the
matter. He believed that neutrality
could be preserved equally as well
without a proclamation as with it. Our
intimate relations with the United
Ptates were of such a nature that our
position was so delicate as to require
very grave consideration before anjÂ»
action was taken. In the meantime i
he would await further information.
Hawaiians are becoming extremely
anxious about mail communications,
and more especially in regard to the
Imported food supply. Taking advan
tage of the situation the merchants
are already raising the prices of staple
imported foods, and as Hawaii pro
duces but little, and this Is a bad year
for rice and taro, the outlook for the
poor man Is not pleasing.
Taking in the general aspect of af
fa.lrs the people are very self-contained
and philosophical, and have come to
the conclusion that annexation will
not again be considered until "the war
is over," and then probably not for
years to come. This is the view now
entertained by the Cabinet and the
Legislature, with the bare hope enter
tained by the most radical that we may
be absorbed as a war measure.
The Government has suffered anoth
er crushing defeat in the House in the
election of the five members of the
Council of State. The House chose to
select five of its own members in pref
erence to such men as an ex-Minister
of Finance, J. F. Lansing: a very
promlnent and intelligent Hawaiian
lawyer, Mr. Ka-ne; a son of the late
Minister H. A. P. Carter, and brother
to their "martyred" Charles Lunt Car
ter, Mr. George R. Carter, and others
equally prominent in position and abil
ity. Those elected were: A. A. V.
Gear of California; A. G. M. Robert
son, son of the late Justice Robertson,
a clever lawyer and an actual member
of the Council; W. C. Achi. half-Chi
nese lawyer (disbarred), useful and in
telligent as a legislator; J. L. Kaulu
kow, the Speaker of the House, and P.
R. Isenberg. This election makes one
third of the Council of State practi
cally a sub-committee of the House,
and is regarded generally as such poor
politics that it would not be wise to go
behind the door to ascertain motives
for the result.
The City of Peking arrived this fore
noon, but brought no news of later
dates.
The legislative excursionists to the
leper settlement on Moiokai returned
last night, having been thoroughly
soaked during their visit of inspection.
The following interesting political gos
â¢lp was gathered from the legislators
on the trip:
It appears that the majority of the
Senate and the House are dissatisfied
with the manner in which the Govern
ment is conducted, and the lack of at
tention it pays to their resolutions of
instructions and condemnation, that
they are preparing three separate
votes of censure, well knowing that the
President will fall back upon the un
constitutionality of such votes and
pay no attention to them, but that
perhaps they may force the resigna
tion of two of the Ministers, and then.
In course of time, by the three to one
method, make the change. They are
also opposed to the imagined candidacy
next year of Mr. Damon for President,
believing that he is pledged to make
Mr. Dole his Minister of Foreign Af
fairs, and Mr. Dole has lost the re
spect and sympathy of many of his old
friends and supporters through the un
fortunate contretemps in connection
with the JSOO contribution to the sur
vivors of the victims at the Maine dis
aster.
The most popular candidate yet jnen
tioned quietly for the Presidency Is J,
O. Carter, although It Is at present
doubtful whether he would consent â¢Â»
accept the nomination. ;
The Senators also regret their hasty
action In connection with the registry;
of vessels act, for some vt their busi
ness associates in the Untted State*
have written to them to use their In
fluence to have all their vessels placed
under the Hawaiian flag, and further
more to let it be publicly known that
the use of the name of the United
States by Minister Cooper to force thÂ»
passage of the bill was unauthorized!
and unjustifiable. The bill Is now be-:
fore the House, but the Influence of
the special clique, in whose interest it
was Introduced, is believed to be In
fluential enough to pass it by a nar
row majority, owing to compromise
made on the election of Councilor of
States and other measures.
The Senators elect their quota of flyÂ»
Councilors of State in the course of fhm
week. They are doubtful whether they!
will follow the example of the House
and elect five of their own body or se
lect new men from the outside. As thÂ»;
President appoints five they are not
desirous of strengthening his power In
the council, they having been fore
warned by the almost absolute control;
the Cabinet has exercised over thm
present council and being determined'
to break down the influence of Minis
ters Cooper and Smith.
The Scrymser cable bill will proba- :
bly receive its coup de gTace In the
Senate to-morrow on account of Its pro
visit, n for an exclusive franchise. It
will be a close fight, for extraordinary
Influences have been brought to bear
in its support; but it is considered al
most a^certainty that the President
will veto it, should it pass.
An interesting debate will occur
when the motion is made demanding
the dismissal from office of the Super
intendent of Public Works, for he Is a
relative and a special protege of the
President, who intends to stand by him.
The fact is, the thirty legislators have
taken the bit In their teeth and are
willing to drive to Jericho so long as
they can damage the Ministry for the
harm they have done the country in
their foreign affairs policy.

HONORS FOR
THE HEROES
OF MANILA
Fitting Tributes Are Paid
Gallant Dewey and His
Subordinates.
All the Members of the Fleet Re
ceived Special Distinction at
the Hands of Congress.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, May 9.
Fitting tribute was paid by the Sen
ate to Commodore Dewey for the mae
nificent victory achieved in the battle
of Manila Bay.
The message from the President was
received recommending that a vote of
thanks be extended by Congress to
Commodore Dewey and the ? pliant
officers and men of his com.uand.
Without a word of debate and without
a dissentine vote the Senate agreed
to the resolution, carrying into effect
the recommendation of the President.
The Senate went farther even than
that. A bill was presented increasing
the number of rear-admirals in the
navy from six to seven, in order that
the President might nominate Commo
dore Dewey to the highest position in
the navy within his gift, and that, too,
was passed without dissent.
.In addition a joint resolution was
unanimously agreed to directing the
Secretary of the Navy to present to
Commodore Dewey a sword of honor,
and to have struck, in commemoration
of the batte of Manila, a bronze medal
for each of the officers and men who
participated in the gallant light. The
resolution appropriates $10,000 to en
able the Secretary to carry its provi
sions into effect.
The bill offered last Friday, author
izing the Postmaster-General to estab
lish postofflces at military posts and
camps, in order to facilitate the de
livery of mail to soldiers, was reported
favorably by the Postofflce and Post
roads Committee and unanimously
passed. Subsequently an amendment
to the postoffice appropriation bill was
agreed to, appropriating 100.000 to
carry the bill into effect.
The postofflce appropriation bill was
under discussion during almost the en
tire session, the subject being the prop
osition to reduce the compensation of
railroads 20 per cent for carrying the
mails. The amendment was defeated
by the decisive vote of 40 to 8.
At a late hour it became evident the
bill could not be disposed of to-day,
and it was unanimously agreed to vote
uoon it at 2 o'clock to-morrow.
PAP A resolution offered by Cannon of
Utah last Friday for an investigation
of trusts was referred to the Commit
tee on Manufacturers.
Consideration of the postofflce appro
priation bill was then resumed, Faulk
ner of West Virginia continuing for tv, o
hours his speech in opposition to the
Pettigrew amendment providing for a
reduction of 20 per cent in the amounts
paid the railroads for transporting the
Butler of North Carolina then deliv
ered an extended speech in favor of the
amendment.
Speeches in support of the amend
ment were made by Allen (Pop.) of
Nebraska and Pettigrew (Sil. Rep.) of
South Dakota.
Quay, in charge of the bill, moved at
the conclusion of the debate to lay the
amendment on the table. The motion
was agreed to â ayes 40, noes 8.
Butler offered an amendment provid
ing that the Government should own
the railway mall cars and that it should
pay to the railroad companies only such
sums as the railroads receive for simi
lar service.
Speaking upon the amendment But
ler declared that the railroads were now
maintaining a "crowd of lobbyists" in
and around the Senate and even the
President's room hal been used as a
lobbying place by the railroad attor
neys. The amendment was defeated
without division.
A committee amendment was offered
by Quay, appropriating $50,000 for the
establishment of postoffices in military
posts and camps during the present
war. The amendment was adopted.
An amendment, offered by Butler,
providing for the punishment of rail
road companies In case of their refusal
to carry mails on their fastest trains.
If desired to do so by the Postmaster
General, was agreed to.
Butler then offered an amendment
eliminating- from that section of the bill
which provides for an investigation of
the question as to whether excessive
prices are being paid railroads for car
rying the mails, the clause which ex
tends the investigations to all sources
of revenue and expenditures of the pos
tal service.
The Senate at 6:55 p. m., on motion
of Cullom, adjourned.

AMUSEMENTS.
Pears'
Only they who
use it know the
luxury of it
r Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, May 9.
The greater part of the day in the
i House was consumed by war meas
ures. The recommendation of the
I President that a vote of thanks be
tendered Commodore Dewey and his
: associate officers and men was followed
quickly with a unanimous vote, and
with equal concert the House passed
the bill creating an additional rear ad
miralship for the hero of Manila.
The bill providing for the organiza
tion of a volunteer engineer brigade
and enlistment of 10,000 troops, immune
to tropical diseases, was passed after
two hours of debate. The principal
ground of opposition presented was
found in the features giving to the
President the appointment of all offi
cers. The Senate bill authorizing the
army to distribute food among the suf
fering Cubans and to arm the Cuban
people was passed.
As soon as the Journal had been read
the President's message was presented
and read. The closest attention was
given by every one in the chamber.
The reading was not interrupted by
applause, but at the conclusion a
demonstration on the floor and in the
galleries followed which continued sev
eral minutes.
Hull called up the immune volunteer
and engineer bill. An hour of debate
upon each side was agreed upon. Hull
said the Senate bill was wanted by the
President and the Secretary of War,
and its immediate passage was urged
because the time for the U6e of the
troops in Cuba was at hand, and the
utmost haste should be made to pre
pare the troops contemplated In the
bill.
Cox of Tennessee opposed the bill
principally because it took out of the
hands oÂ£ the volunteers the appoint
ment of officers. He contended that
the immunes would come from two or
three Southern States, and they should
name their colonels, lieutenant-col
onels, majors, captains and field offi
cers. To deny them that privilege
would be unfair and would be a dis
crimination between the volunteers
called out under the previous act and
those to be called out under the pro
posed bill.
King of Utah asserted the bill was
unnecessary, that it discredited the
bravery and power of troops in doubt
ing that 150,000 men already ordered,
aided by our fleet, was inadequate to
subjugate the island and establish
peace.
"If we had landed 2r>.000 men on the
soil of Cuba two weeks ago," he de
clared with vehemence, "and had taken
adequate arms to the insurgents and
had deployed our fleet before Havana,
Havana long since would have fallen
and the stars and stripes long ere this
would have floated over Morro Cas
tle."
Hawley of Texas said the bravery of
the bravest men could not cope with
the hidden and insidious foe, yellow
fever, before which armies bowed. The
organization of immunes was impera
tive under the condition in Cuba,
Grow of Pennsylvania, the veteran
member of the House, took occasion to
criticize those members of the House
who assumed to know better how to
conduct the war than the President
and his secretaries of War and Navy.
He said he had seen a similar exhibi
tion during the Civil War.
Steele of Indiana approved the bill.
Savers of Texas said while he pre
ferred to have the bill amended, so as
to leave the naming of officers with
the volunteers, he would support it
without such an amendment in the
event it could not be secured.
Lewis of Washington opposed the
feature of the bill which placed with
the President the power of appoint
ments of officers and further opposed
the bill because it was indefinite as to
the determination of the question of
the volunteers' Immunity.
Lentz of Ohio opposed the bill, and
Bailey argued for the naming of the of
ficers by the troops to be appointed by
the Governors of the States, in accord
ance with the volunteer bill formerly
passed.
After a number of amendments In
tended to take from the President the
appointment of the officers of the im
mune volunteers had been voted down
an additional section offered by Gros
venor was adopted. It declared spe
cifically that the provisions relative to
apportionment of volunteers to the sev
eral States under call by proclamation
and to the appointment of officers as
made in the rocent act providing tot
125,000 volunteers shall not apply to the
present act.
A motion to recommit, offered by Cox
of Tennessee, was voted down and the
bill as amended was passed.
"While a District of Columbia bill was
under consideration Bailey raised a
point of no quorum, and at 4:50 p. m.
the House adjourned.
GUARDING POWDER WORKS
NEAR SAN RAFAEL
SAN RAFAEL, M-^ 9.â About six
weeks ago there was an explosion at
the Fnitr-d States Smokeless Powder
Works about three and a half miles
east of this city, which resulted in the
death of Captain Jenks and a man
named Nelson. At the time the explo
sion was believed to have been acci
dental, but some information must
have been secured tending toward the
theory of design, for three weeks ago
a strong guard was placed about the
works, and to gain admit anee to the
premises now requires an identity
above suspicion. The works are used
entirely in manufacturing powder for
firearms, but it is h^id by some that
Spanish spies may have become im
bued with the idea that in these troub
lous times the Government might make
a contract with the company. It is
rumored that several suspicious char
acters have been noticed at various
times prowling around the hills in the
vicinity. Superintendent Stark refuses
to discuss the matter or even to aiate
why the guards have been placed
around the works. The fact remains
that they are there, and any emissary
of Spain will be given a war i recep
tion.
THE SAN FRAKCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 10, 1898.
PRESIDENT AND CONGRESS
THANK ADMIRAL DEWEY
McKINLEY'S MESSAGE.
WASHINGTON, May 9.â The President to-day sent the following
message to Congress:
"To the Congress of the United States:
"On the 24th of April I directed the Secretary of the Navy to tele
graph orders to Commodore George Dewey of the United States navy,
commanding the Asiatic squadron, then lying in the port of Hongkong,
to proceed forthwith to the Philippine Islands, there to commence ope
rations and engage the Spanish fleet.
"Promptly obeying that order, the United States squadron, consist
ing of the flagship Olympia, the Baltimore, Raleigh, Boston, Concord and
Petrel, with the revenue cutter Hugh McCulloch as an auxiliary dis
patch-boat, entered the harbor of Manila at daybreak on the Ist of May
and immediately engaged the entire Spanish fleet of eleven ships, which
were under the protection of the fire of land forts. After a stubborn
fight, in which the enemy suffered great loss, these vessels were de
stroyed or completely disabled and the water battery at Cavite si
lenced. Of our brave officers and men not one was lost and only eight
injured, and those slightly. All of our ships escaped any serious
damage.
"By the 4th of May Commodore Dewey had taken possession of the
naval station at Cavite, destroying the fortifications there and at the
entrance of the bay and paroling their garrisons, and the waters of the
bay are under his complete control. He has established hospitals with
in the American lines, where 250 of the Spanish sick and wounded are
assisted and protected.
"The magnitude of this victory can hardly be measured by the
ordinary standards of naval warfare. Outweighing any material advan
tage is the moral effect of this initial success. At this unsurpassed
achievement the great heart of our nation throbs, not with boasting or
with greed of conquest, but with a deep gratitude that this triumph has
come in a Just cause, and that, by the grace of God, an effective step has
thus been taken toward the attatnment of the wlshed-for peace. To
those whose skill, courage and devotion have won the fight, to the gal
lant commander and the brave officers and men who aided him, our
country owes an incalculable debt.
"Feeling as our people feel, and speaking in their name, I at once
sent a message to Commodore Dewey, thanking him and his officers
and men for their splendid achievement and overwhelming victory, and
informing him that I had appointed him an acting rear-admiral.
"I now recommend that, following our national precedents and ex
pressing the fervent gratitude of every patriotic heart, the thanks of
Congress be given Acting Rear- Admiral George Dewey of the United
States navy for highly distinguished conduct in conflict with the en
emy, and to the officers and men under his command for their gallantry
in the destruction of the enemy's fleet and the capture of the enemy's
fortifications in the bay of Manila. WILLIAM McKINLEY."
"Executive Mansion, May 9, 1898."
THREE REPORTS
OF BATTLES IN
CUBAN WATERS
Rumor That the Montgomery Cap
tured Two Prizes After a
Sharp Combat.
KEY WEST, Fla., May 9.â Three separate reports of
engagements of United States warships reached here to
night, but thus far details are wanting.
One rumor Is that the cruiser Montgomery has cap
tured two prizes off Cape Haytien, after a sharp battle
with two Spanish gunboats, and put into St. Nicholas
slightly damaged.
Another says that the tug Osceola of the Mosquito
fleet was fired upon near Havana, and the third Is that
three Spanish gunboats fired upon the United States tor
pedo-boat Winslow at Cardenas, but were repulsed by
the Winslow after one had been disabled.
URGE CLAIMS
OF DICKINSON
Messrs. Perkins, Loud and
Barham Visit the
President.
Reproved by the Executive for
a So-Called Change of
Front.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Tli <rss House,
Washington, May 9.
Senator Perkins and Representatives
Loud and Barham called on the Pres-
ident to-day and recommended that
General John H. Dickinson of San
j Francisco be appointed brigadier-gen
eral of volunteers. This, Senator Per
kins said, was in response to a general
] request from officers and men of the
! California National Guard, as well as
| many prominent California citizens.
But the President n-as greatly sur-
I prised and did not hesitate to say so.
He even went further than a mere
expression of surprise. He gently re
proved the delegation for changing
front, reminding Senator Perkins that
a few days ago he had asked for the
appointment of Colonel H. G. Otis of
Los Angeles, whereupon the Senator
stated that he was for any good man
whom the people of California seemed
to prefer and he thought that General
Dickinson was the favorite.
Mr. Loud here spoke up and declared
that until that moment he had not
been apprised of the fact that Otis had
been recommended by Messrs. Perkins
and Barham. The President gave
the trio to understand that the
change of front was disagreea-
I ble to him, and intimated that no
i Californian would be appointed, mas,
, much as the members of the delegation
i seemed unable to unite upon any ono.
Senator Perkins says that the Presi
dent to-day desired him to present to
I the people of California his hearty con
| gratulations and high appreciation of
their prompt response to his call for
volunteers.
Senator Perkins says Wilson will en
deavor to secure the brigadier-general
ship for Washington. He does not be
lieve the California delegation will be
able to agree and that the appointment
will therefore go to Washington or Ore
gon.

FOLSOM ROAD
CASE DECIDED
Sacramento City May Not
Be Taxed for the
Boulevard.
Superior Judge Gaddis Hands
Down His Ruling in a
Test Suit.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WOODLAND. May 9. â Superior
Judge Gaddis of Yolo County handed
down a decision to-day In the Folsom
road bond case, which he recently
heard In Sacramento. The Board of
Supervisors of Sacramento County
called an election to vote upon the
proposition of issuing bonds in the
sum of $75,000 for building the Folsom
boulevard, and included the munici
pality of Sacramento. The proposition
carried a.nd the bonds ere sold to M.
W. Harris & Co. of New York.
Charles E. Wright, a taxpayer of the
city of Sacramento, then applied to the
courts for a writ of injunction to re
strain the Board of Supervisors from
proceeding to levy a tax upon the
property within the municipality of
Sacramento to pay the interest and a
portion of the principal of said bonds.
Judge Gaddis holds that the law is
very explicit that municipalities can
not be taxed for road purposes, and
that the issuance of bonds for such
purposes, including a municipality, is
but another form of taxation and an
attempt to do in an indirect manner
what cannot be done by direct taxa
tion. The petition is granted and the
writ ordered issued.
It is understood that an appeal to
the Supreme Court will be taken from
the decision.

FROM FRIENDS OF
THE RED CROSS
Many Timely Donations for Humanity's Work.
The Orpheum's Matinee for Next
Thursday.
Many welcome subscriptions â¢were re
ceived at the headquarters of the Red
Cross Society yesterday. Major Hooper
started the list In the morning by
sending a check to the president of the
society for $250, and in the note accom
panying it he said that if it were neces
sary he would willingly double or tre
ble the amount. Major Hooper has
had experience in war and he knows
too well the sufferings attendant there
to and how much the little comforts
that can be furnished by the Red Cross
Society are appreciated by the men on
the battle fields. Rosenbaum Bros,
added a check for $50 to the list and
many donations of from $25 down were
received. So far the amount collected
amounts to about $1200 and the most
of it was received yesterday, when a
systematic collection was commenced.
Subscription lists were opened in the
business offices of all the leading daily
papers in the city yesterday. To-day
several of the ladies on the collection
committee will commence a canvass of
the city. The subscription lists they
will carry will be approved by the of
tlcers of the society and they will have
the signatures of Mrs. Willard B. Har
rington, Mrs. J. F. Merrill and Mrs. J.
G. Sanborn.

DENVER, May 9.â After reading the
ia.ted Press dispatch from Bo,s- j
t ;. this afternoon announcingthatÃob |
tnmona had accepted his offer of
525,000 for an opportunity to regain the I
.-weight championship, James J.
Cornett sent the following dispatch to
W. A. Brady, his manager, who is in
New York City:
Go afler that man < r'itzsimmons) and j
make my offer to him againâ s2s,ooo that i
I will stop him in ten roundsâ and put up
some money. Show him up.
â¢'Fitzsimmons says he will accept my
offer of $25,000 for a chance to fight
him," said Corbett. "That's not my
offer at all. I say I will bet $25,000 I
can .stop him in ten rounds, and I can
an it. That shows what a coward he
do it. He is just trying to get out of
it. That shows what a coward he
is. If Fitzpimmons will put up some
money I will fee in New York inside of
two weeks to make the match. I'll go,
anyway. Ap soon as I leave here â it is
Sunday â I will go right on to New-
York and hunt him up. I'll tell him
what he is to his face."

In addition to money contributions
the society proposes to send with the
soldiers many of the delicacies that are
craved by the sick, and the merchants
and manufacturers will be asked to
contribute them. Colonel Middleton of
the United States Army Medical Corps
has given the ladies of the Red Cross
a list of the articles that would be ac
ceptable, and which the Government
does not supply. It contains dried
and canned fruits, crackers, canned
soups, beef extracts, corn starch, tap
ioca, jams and jellies, seasonings and
spices, lime Juice, tobacco and pipes,
toilet soaps, stationery, brushes,
combs, towels and assorted liquors. A
depot will be opened by the commit
tee to receive such contributions and
prepare them for shipment with thÂ»
hospital supplies on the steamers that
carry away the troops to Manila. Mer
chants who can contribute such arti
cles are asked to send to the head
quarters of the society In the ClausÂ»
Spreckels building lists of what they
will donate.
The benefit performance to be given
| by the performers of the Orpheum will
be one of the best entertainments ever
given at that house. Many of the
cleverest specialty artists of the coun
try have offered to take a part In the
performance and they, in addition to
the reerular bill that is on this week,
will fill Thursday afternoon full of
amusement. Maude Rockwell, who is
at present at the Olympla. will appear
I at the benefit, and the Venetian La
dles' Orchestra have volunteered their
services. The orchestra is well known
in the city. The feature of the en
tertainment will be Marion Kerner's
visions of art. Many appropriate scenes
will be presented.
induce them to come together again.
The foregoing telegram proves his ef
forts have been at last successful. A.
Livingston, who manages the Carson
end of Stuart's affairs, said:
â¢I have known negotiations in this
direction were pending for some time.
So far I have received no word from
Stuart, but I am expecting a message
at any time. The fight between Fjtz
simmons and McCoy I know little
about. It may be that the men will
meet for a limited number of rounds
before the big fight in Carson. I hard
ly think it possible Fitzsimmons would
meet McCoy before Corbett. There is
a possibility of defeat, which would
bar him from meeting Pompadour
Jim. The date mentioned in the Bos
ton dispatch I cannot vouch for. I
believe the fight will occur about Sep
tember 26, or after the California-
Nevada State fair.
ROCHESTER. N. V., May 9.âWil
liam A. Brady gave out this signed
statement to-day:
James J. Corbett stands by the offer
he made Robert Fitzsimmons: To make
a match for a $10,000 side bet, and w 1 1
g-uarantee the champion of the world
$22 r > 000 if he (Torbett) rails to stop Fitzsim
mons in ten rounds, and he further agrees
that the match shall take place before the
last of September, this year, and if no
club offers as large a purse as $20.000 Cor
bett will deposit the balance, the whole
amount to be paid Fitzsimmons in case
Corbett fails to knock him out in the stip
ulated number of rounds. As Fitzsimmons
has announced that he will fight again, it
remains to be seen whether he will take
on the man he has all along claimed to be
so easy. He is positively assured of $25,
000 in case hp stands ten rounds in front
of Corbett and $45,000 in case he wins.
This is the offer Corbett made to Fitzsim
mons last February, and he now stands
by it. and I will accept Julians bet of
$iVK3 that Corbett will be on hand on the
day named. I will be in New York on
Wednesday and will meet Fitzsimmons
or his manager to deposit money to make
the match. W. A. BRADY.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALX., TUESDAY, MAY 10, 1898.
CANDELARIA
IS A "CLAM"
At Odds On Easily Beaten
by Flandes, a 100 to
1 Shot.
Sly at Odds of 12 to 1 Downed
a Fast Crowd of
Sprinters.
Three Favorites in Front Â«t Oakland.
Miss Rowena Turned Up an
Easy Winner.
If a Spanish cruiser had sailed Into the
harbor and dropped a shell In the center
of the infield. It would have proved no
more of a startling surprise than the
win of the 100 to 1 shot Flandes at Oak
land track yesterday. The outsider's un
expected victory happened In the fourth
event of the day, a mile and a sixteenth
selling run, for which Candelaria, with
little Woods up, was a prohibitive 1 to 7
favorite In the betting. The latter had
finished third in the Burns handicap, and
meeting such a oheap collection the price
laid seemed a liberal one. For the past
month or so Flandes has been trying to
down some very cheap articles in the
race-horse line with 111 success, and at
post time anywhere from 60 to 75 to 1
could be had about him. Ridden by an
obscure pilot named Whitman, the
despised one made all the running, and at
the finish won comparatively easily from
the favorite in the slow time of 1:4934.
The latter was messed about considerably
the first six furlongs, but showed a total
lack of inability to get up when Woods
shook him up in the stretch ; in fact, he was
hard ridden to beat Del Paso out a short
head for the place. Many small bets were
registered in the books on the winner,
and the victory was a very popular one.
Of the other favorites three met with
better success. Dolore and Sly both
crossed the wire first at very healthy
odds, the latter heavily backed. Nearly
all of the books quit behind on the day's
speculating.
W. J. Spiers' bay horse Millbrae, with
Piggott in the saddle, was installeii favor
ite for the opening five and a naif fur
long scramble with a big field going to the
post, and after shaking off Red Spider,
won hands down. Lona Marie was third,
behind the latter horse.
The fast R. Q. Ban was extensively sup
ported and shipped to the post favorite
for the six-furlong sprint next decided,
but after tripping along out in the lead
until well on toward the wire found the
distance too far and the company too
pressing and ended up in the show. In
a hard drive Clawson got Dolore, a 5 to
1 cnance, over the line a scant head be
fore the unlucky Lucky Star, a 15 to 1
shot in the ring. Lost Girl was tardy in
getting up.
The two-year-old event at four and a
half furlongs went to the hot favorite.
El Mido, ridden by Piggott. Rev Hooker
looked a winner down the stretch, but
Enos, who had the mount, could not re
sist looking back at the field, and was
collared by the favorite at the paddock.
The latter bore in forty yards from the
wire, interfering with Hooker, and allow
ing Woods on Obsidian to get the place
by a head.
The six-furlong selling sprint, fifth on
the card, was certainly a horse race.
O'Connell was of course made a pro
nounced favorite in me betting, but he
appears to have trained off, for San Ma
teo had the old sprinter raced to a stand
still by the time the stretch was reached.
There the whole field became bunched
and It looked anybody's race. When
paddock was neared. Clawson astride
Sly drew away from the bunch, winning
cleverly by a couple of lengths. Behind
her all whipping hard. Chappie, O'Con
nell, Sport \icAlllster, San Mateo and
Peixotto finished heads apart.
The Burns & Waterhnuse entry. Miss
Rowena, was a short-priced choice for
the final five-furlong scramble, and after
leading from the start won easily from
Stepabout, the second choice.

evening. Neither rider was seen In the saddle
here much the past season.
The big chestnut horse Rubicon was sold at
shertfl"n sale yesterday at Ing-leslde track. He
was knocked down to the bid of Billy Short
for $800. The latter was undoubtedly acting
for an outside party.
The Lassen stable folks, owners of Sly, from
current gossip narrowly escaped getting a
boost after the mare won the fifth race. It
was said that Bookmaker Billy Beverly sent
one of his employes out to the stand to bid her
up to $1000. The commissioner arrived Just as
she was knocked down to her owners. Her last
two races previous to yesterday were not very
pretty ones to look at.
George Bayless, trainer of Flandes, thought
the chestnut horse had a great chance to win.
and bet to the extent of his bank roll, getting
60 to 1. The horse's owner placed his money
on for place, and after the race presented
George with the purse.
Piggott and Clawson divided the riding hon
ors, each piloting two winners.
Fourteen books laid prices In the ring. There
was no kicking among the layers of odds about
bad business.

THE LATEST
IN BASEBALL
BY JOE CORBETT.
President Bert called a meeting of the
officers and managers of the Pacific
Coast Baseball league last evening, with
the intention of putting the finishing
touches to the matters left unsettled at
the last meeting. Representatives of the
various teams responded to the summons,
and after some little delay a committee
consisting of Mr. Ewlng. Mr. Kaplfin, Mr.
Hennesy and Mr. Donohoo was appointed
by President Bert to act In conjunction
with Mr. Spapieton in perfecting a sched
ule, to be presented at the next meeting,
which is to be held a week from to-night.
The games for next Saturday and Sunday
will be played as follows: On Saturday,
May 14. Oakland plays Santa Cruz at
Recreation Park. On Sunday, May 15,
Santa Cruz will play the Athletics at
Recreation Park; at Sacramento, San
Francisco vs. Sacramento; at Fresno,
Stockton vs. Fresno; at San Jose, Oak
land vs. San Jose.
It was decided that no ball-player not
in this State before September 15 can
be signed by any manager in the league.
This was done so that Eastern ball-play
ers returning home could not be made
piny. It was further decided that no
player could leave one team and play
with another without the mutual consent
of both managers.
Won by Mayfieid Colts.
MAYFIET,!"), May 9.â The Portola Base

ENTRIES CLOSED
The Record for the Coast
Bids Fair to Be
Broken.
Country Still to Be Heard
From â Dog Men
Dilatory.
Promising Young English Setters
Deadâ A Great Exhibit
Expected.
As well as can be Judged at the present
time, the entries for the bench show bid
fair to exceed those of last year, both In
number and quality. In the latter re
spect there Is, beyond doubt, a great Im
provement to be noted, and as regards the
number, the officers of the San Francisco
Kennel Club are of the opinion that when
the country entries come in they will
swc*. the total to about thirty In excess
of that of 1597. This is a consummation
devoutly to be wished by the dogmen. The
members of the bench show and other
committees have given their time, trou
ble and money unsparingly and ungrudg
ingly in behalf of the show, and their
disinterested efforts deserve success.
It must be borne in mind that 75 per
cent of the net proceeds of the show will
be employed to further the cause of San
Francisco's charities.
The Humboldt kennels have purchased
from Mrs. Lee of Toledo, Ohio, the fine
young St. Bernard Alto Millo, by Judiths

winnings are first (open), Indianapolis,

IT IS A WONDERFUL BELT.
This famous life-giver has a grand record. There is
hardly a day but shows a new cure. It gives life to its
wearer. It charges the blood with vitality and drives all

his book for men or women free. Get it to-day.

HELP THE RED CROSS.
THE red cross represents the noblest form of
charity, not the giving of alms, but the bestowal
of gifts which are the right of the recipients,
at once a token of generosity, of friendship; gifts
which mean a godspeed and a benison.
Brave boys are going to the wars. They may be
called to Cuba or to the Philippines. In either case
they go to meet a foreign foe and the more deadly
enemy which lurks in tropic swamps. Some of them
will never return. They should be sent away know
ing that their State honors them, holds them in ten-
dor regard, intends that when they reach alien shores
they shall lack no comfort which thoughtfulness can
.provide.
* The Red Cross League of California has been or
ganized by earnest people. It must be said to the
credit of the women that they are its most active
members. Their hearts have been touched, and the
warmth of their sympathy has infected all about them.
It is not that men lack any measure of sympathy, but
the\ are busy. They are ready to give, but they wait
to be asked. They will not have long to wait. Sub
scriptions will be received from this time on until
there shall be no further need. It is not for a moment
feared that these will be slow in coming.
The First and Seventh regiments of California vol
unteers are in camp. Within a few days they are to
be started on a perilous journey. The time for pro
viding them with all they need is short, yet it will be
long enough. But this will not end the work. The
work must go on until the war has passed and the
boys, safe home again, have turned once more to the
pu: suits of peace.
NO TIN SOLDIERS.
THERE has been a tendency at times to poke fun
at the National Guard. Just why this should
have been so has never clearly appeared. It is
true that men who ordinarily are devoted to the arts
of peace and who don their uniforms generally for
parade pucposes could not be expected to meet a
sudden emergency just as trained soldiers would have
met it. Their leaders ofttimes have been incompetent.
The men in the ranks might be willing to obey or
ders to the utmost and be baffled by weak-kneed offi
cers. Now that the country has made a call the men
of the guard are ready and eager. They realize that
the prospect is not for a holiday. The stern business of
war confronts them, and they offer themselves. They
come so freely that the service cannot use them all.
There have been a few instances in which the men
have allowed themselves to think that war was a
scheme for the advancement of the individual, while,
indeed, it has a purpose much more serious. Some
guardsmen in this State, in Colorado, in New York,
and possibly elsewhere, have refused to serve unless
they were given the privilege of naming their own
officers. Happily the vacancy they thought to create
was filled too quickly /to be appreciable. It is no
time now for log-rolling. War offers no opportunity
to the tin soldier. But the young patriots come for
ward, full of courage, brimming over with en
thusiasm, anxious to endure risk and hardship. The
tin soldier may remain at home. The boys at the
front will not miss him.
Naturally enough, the bulletins received from
Washington during the day are not always absolutely
accurate. They necessarily embody rumor and opin
ion, neither perhaps well founded. The one stating
that the California volunteers would be sent to
Florida may be taken as a sample. If troops are to
go to Manila it is morally certain that the Californians
will be among them. The manifest absurdity of ship
ping them eastward and bringing others from the
East to take their places, entailing as it would addi
tional expense and delay, at once stamps the report
as groundless.
Another evil of prize-fighting is that every plug
ugly who becomes a professional thumper drifts from
the ring to the stage. It must be remembered that
there is in progress an effort to elevate the stage, and
this habit of the sloggers is a heavy handicap. The
public may be conscientious, but there is a limit to
its lifting powers.
The people of the United States are not gratified
at the opportunity to shed blood* Still, the sudden
death of the Spanish who hoisted flags of truce and
then shot at Americans who accepted the signals in
good faith will not create in this country an appre
ciable amount of mourning.
French papers are deeply chagrined by the Ameri
can victory at Manila. They had been so certain that
Dewey was bottled up in the bay. They apparently
lost sight of the fact that Dewey went equipped for
blowing out the cork.
Perhaps some of the politiciaus scrambling for
generalships do not realize that the gold braid they
hope to wear is subject to. thegperil oi being shot off.
THE CHARTER CAMPAIGN.
IT is a part and parcel of the highly edifying cam
paign which is now being conducted in favor of the
proposed charter to charge that the corporations
are "against" it Thus, the ex-Mission-street Boodler
calls on the people to ask themselves why certain in
dividuals who have read the instrument and demanded
explanations from its advocates, in the absence of
satisfactory answers, have usurped the privitege of
opposing its adoption. The Boodler does not deign
to explain anything. It does not tell us why it thinks
an autocratic Mayor is just the thing we want. It
merely alleges that the corporation organs are
"against" him and urges the people on that ground to
vote for the charter.
This would be a weak position to assume even if the
premises upon which it is based were true. But, as
a matter of fact, it is notorious that neither the cor
porations nor their organs are "against" the charter.
The Evening Post, the regularly retained and author
ized representative of the Southern Pacific in this
city, is a strong advocate of the adoption of the in
strument.
Up to date the Post has complimented the charter
makers for two features of their work. One is the
clever manner in which they have fixed the present
monopoly in street railway transportation. (We
imagine that Market-street railway bonds will go up
several points if the charter is adopted.) The other
is the skill with which they have placed the saloon
keepers of the city completely in the hands of the
Mayor and Police Commission. In order to suppress
the "saloon vote" and abolish the saloons the Post
says the people under the charter need only pledge
the Mayor to appoint a temperance Police Commis
sion.
No other corporation organ has said a word about
the charter. The fact that the organs are all devoting
strict attention to the war to the exclusion of the
subject plainly indicates the character of their "or
ders." The Boodlcr thinks the sugar trust is
"against" the charter. For the purpose of answering
this averment we assume that the sugar trust is in
terested. The Boodler's evidence on this point should
be conclusive. It is the business of the Boodler to
ascertain the interests of corporations for the purpose
of blackmailing them, and it certainly ought to know
whether or not the sugar trust is interested in the
adoption of the charter. But if the sugar trust is
"against" the charter it is certainly out of its mind.
Centralization of municipal power is exactly what the
trust ought to desire. By combining with the rail
road, water, gas and other corporations, it may, un
der the proposed charter, easily capture the Mayor,
and, thus, by electing one man, accomplish what is
now accomplished by electing several.
The truth of the matter is, however, none of the
corporations are "against" the charter. On the con
trary, they are hard at work winning the "push" over
to it.' The extreme quiet which overspreads the poli
tical horizon indicates that the plans for its adoption
are well matured. But if the people, with the aid of
the ex-Mission-street Boodler, fall into the trap it
will be their own fault. Perhaps Huntington and the
Boodler have again got together. The former has not
yet been asked by the Railroad Commission concern
ing that $30,000 "advertising" contract. Can it be
possible that a new contract has been entered into, a
covenant of which is the creation in this city of a
Lord Mayor to be owned by Huntington?
POSOTFFICE ECONOMIES.
Q MENDMENTS made in the Senate to the
f\ postoffice appropriation bill, though designed
* *in the interests of economy, will not be popu
lar with any portion of the people. It is even doubt
ful whether the House will agree to them, and prob
ably the only effect they will produce will be that of
reviving the discussion over the postal deficit, which
cuoied so ranch of public attention during the past
winter.
All parties arc agreed that the annual deficit in the
postal revenues is the result of wasteful methods em
ployed at present, but differences exist as to the
proper remedy to apply. In the House two plans of
economy were put forward. One of these aimed to
reduce the expense of carrying second class mail mat
ter by restricting the privilege of that class of postage
to legitimate newspapers. The other aimed at re
ducing the cost of transporting all classes of mail by
diminishing the rates paid the railroads for transpor
tation. Either of these if adopted would have put an
end to the deficit, but both were rejected and the bill
went to the Senate framed in such a way as to make
it certain another deficit would result from the oper
ations of the year.
The Senators in seeking economy have adopted
neither of the plans proposed in the House. Their
amendments will restrict the postal service in cities
by limiting the mail deliveries to a number not ex
ceeding four each day, and the country service by
striking out the appropriation for rural free delivery.
This means not economy in the true sense of the
word, but a saving of money by lessening the service
rendered. We are not to have under the Senate
amendments a more economical administration of
the postoffice, but a cheaper and poorer mail accom
modation for the people.
Nothing can be said in favor of the reduction in
the service except that it will save a considerable sum
of money, and when the burden of war taxes begins
to be felt that may perhaps be accounted a good ar
gument. It will not be forgotten, however, that if
the Loud bill had been adopted the deficit would
have been overcome and the necessity for reducing
the service would not have existed. As the matter
stands the whole question comes up for reargument
and possibly for settlement by some plan which will
diminish the cost of the service without in any way
diminishing the service itself.
The ministers of this city deserve praise and thanks
for the manly attitude they have sustained from the
first in relation to the duty i>i this country to subdue
and in a measure civilize Spain. Only one or two of
them have talked "peace at any price," and happily
no attention has been paid to these.
Of course it is pleasingtotalkof the Spanish squadron
as "Sampson's prey," but it is a trifle rash to consider
the squadron as being taken. There are doubtless
men aboard those ships who have a prejudice against
being the prey to anybody, and they have some guns
wherewith to express disapproval.
The recent interview with the Queen Regent was
a fake, and the one with Mrs. McKinley was a fake.
This was their only excuse for being printed. Had
they been true, to neither would have attached the
least interest nor importance.
Probably reports that yellow fever had broken out
in the South arose from the presence there of stray
copies of one of Hearst's journals.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 10, 1898.
(I SIN OF OMISSION.
SECRETARY PORTER has found it necessary
to issue through the Associated Press a state
ment warning the public against alleged inter
views with the President and Mrs. McKinley pub
lished in the unscrupulous yellow journals. Referring
to certain recent fakes of the kind, which were false
both in text and in substance, Mr. Porter says: "The
President made no such comments either to repre
sentatives of the press or to individuals. Since his
inauguration he has adhered strictly to the policy of
not talking for publication, and this will continue to
be the invariable rule in the future. Any other course
would be injudicious, for reasons which need not be
dwelt upon. The same applies to Mrs. McKinley,
who has several times recently been misquoted as
having granted authorized interviews."
The warning is timely and will be well received by
the public, and yet in making it Mr. Porter was guilty
of a regrettable sin of omission. He should have made
his reference to the offending journals as definite as
he made his denial of their fakes. He should have
named the papers that concocted the lies and thus
made his warning and rebuke doubly effective.
Mr. Porter doubtless thought the general public
would know to what papers he referred without his
naming them, and the thought in the main was well
founded, but none the less would it have been better
for him to have been clear and specific. A vague
charge leaves a certain sense of vagueness in the
minds of all who read it, no matter how well posted
they may be. Moreover, a lying journalist cares little
for a general charge against lying journalism. The
only way to make him wince is to point him out to
popular scorn by naming him.
An illustration of the' defectiveness of Mr. Porter's
method of dealing with the evil is to be found in the
fact that his statement was published yesterday by The
Call and the Chronicle, but not by the Examiner.
The reason the latter journal did not publish it is be
cause it is one of the offending journals that circulat
ed the faked interview with Mrs. McKinley. This
fact, however, was probably noted by a comparatively
few persons, whereas, if Mr. Porter had named the
Examiner and the Journal as the fakers of the false
interviews the point and object of his statement
would have been fully understood by all.
It is high time for the line between true journalism
and the daily publication of lying fakes to be clearly
and impressively drawn. This can never be done by
issuing disclaimers in general terms. Men who have
occasion to notify the public of faked nnd false inter
views should never neglect to give notice also of the
paper that did the wrong. The alleged interview with
Mrs. McKinley was for example a gross and indecent
outrage, and the President's secretary in correcting
the injury as far as he could by denial should have
gone further and made the liar that concocted it feel
the lash of public scorn by giving both his name and
that of the journal that employed him to do his dis
reputable work.
SPANISH FINANCIERING.
THE delay of the war revenue bill in the Senate
is for the purpose of exploiting theories and
making politics. The fiatists propose that the
Government shall be left without revenue in this war
emergency unless they have their way and try their
crude experiments with the public credit. The ex
perience derived from the financial legislation of our
Civil War teaches that the costliest method of emer
gency financiering is the issue of legal tender paper
as credit notes like the greenbacks. It is also the
easiest method for fooling some of the people all the
time, and all of the people some of the time, as it did
in 1862. The Government must pay soldiers and
sailors, provide transportation and commissary, equip
a medical staff and hospital corps, buy arms and
munitions of war, build or buy ships and man them.
It must, in other words, be continually buying some-
ghing and can no more control the price of it than
can a private person. When it pays in paper credits
like the greenbacks the more it issues the less is
their purchasing power and the more i. has to pay
in its promises to pay for what it needs to use.
As we have said repeatedly, this method doubled
the cost of the Civil War. The people have ever
since been paying two dollars for one dollar value
received, together with the interest on the exira dol
lar for which they got nothing.
Now the fiatists in the Senate are holding back the
war revenue bill until they can so amend it as to call
for an immediate issue of $150,000,000 more credit
notes like the greenbacks. They do this in order to
lend consistency to their incendiary howl about the
bondholders. The Government can borrow $500,
000,000 on 3 per cent bonds which will sell at a
premium of 4 per cent, and can with the proceeds
buy what it needs to earn' on the war, getting a
dollar's value for every dollar paid. But this does
not suit the fiatists. They have been the most per
sistent detractors of Spain and have done most of the
inflammatory appealing which has excited our people.
But now, taking advantage of the public necessity,
they propose to compel the Government to imitate
the Spanish financial methods, which are part of the
evidence of the decay of that nation. They might as
well insist that the strategic boards of the army and
navy imitate the military methods of Spain, and that
we adopt her ideas and plans of armament on land
and sea.
The method they propose is the costliest and most
extravagant It is' adopted by Spain because by that
kind of financiering she has so depleted her credit
that she has no other resort. She is like a starving
bankrupt who issues his notes of hand and sells them
for what trifle they will fetch.
But we are under no such necessity. Our credit
is high; we do not have to resort to the methods of
the defaulted and insolvent nations, and least of all
need we imitate the unhappy and unscientific methods
of our moribund enemy.
If this Spanish financiering succeed in the Senate
it will be the beginning of domestic troubles of the
most serious and far-reaching character. It will put
upon the President the necessity of vetoing the bill
and leaving the treasury without resources to supply
the drain of war, or he will be compelled to sign it
and double the cost of the adventure. In either
case more harm is done to the people and taxpayers
than Spain can inflict if the war were to last a dozen
years.
When the primary Red Cross move was made in
this city several people had the nerve to attend the
meeting and decry the whole matter. The way in
which they were swept aside must occasion within
their minds about the same degree of conviction a
person is said to have when a house falls on him.
lt is to be hoped the Governor of the Philippines
will not interpret his order "to resist to the last" to
mean that he is to poison the water supply of Manila.

SPAIN EXPIATING HER SINS.
We have consistently deprecated a resort to hostilities throughout th .

CANADIAN GOVERNMENT'S RAILROAD TO THE YUKON.
The announcement that the Provincial Government has perfected its
plans to secure the immediate construction of a railway from a coast port,
in this province, to the headwaters of the Yukon, at Teslin Lake, will be
received with entire satisfaction on the coast. The measure is such, we
believe, that it will meet with the approbation of every right-thinking,
fair-minded, unbiased man. The Government administration is certainly
to be commended for its action in this matter, as it has risen to an occasion
forced upon it, in consequence of the Senate rejecting the arrangement
made between the Federal Government and Messrs. Mackenzie & Mann.
Having already referred to the importance of this work to British Col
umbia as a whole, and to the coast cities in particular, as well as to the
farming community, it is not necessary now to repeat that which we have
already stated. This, we can say, however, that \*a action to be taken by
the Government and .the Legislature will mark a new era in the history
of the province. It Vill give a stimulus to business generally, and will
have for its effect the continuance of a period of prosperity, the parallel of
which has never been witnessed on the coast before. It is believed now
that many who have hitherto been hostile to the scheme being undertaken
by the Government, will" give their adhesion to the proposition.â The World,

PUTTING THEMSELVES IN OUR PLfICE.
It Is difficult for Englishmen to follow with any real appreciation the
development of opinion in America. We cannot realize the impression
which has been made by the destruction of the Maine, but we may conceive
It as a flash-light which has made a vivid reality of the atrocious regime in
Cuba. Until the Maine w r as destroyed, the tale of Cuba pricked the con
science from a distance, but there were a dozen reasons for postponing or
avoiding active measures. After the destruction of the Maine, the iniqui
ties of Spain have seemed urgent and actual, a crying cause for immediate
intervention. There are no doubt questions of policy Intermingled, but none
of us can doubt the emotion is natural and humane, or that we ourselves
should in like position have been equally inflamed. Let us, then, be care
ful how we pose as critics of American behavior at this difficult moment.
We confess that from this point of view we follow with singular vexation
the tone and manner of the communications which the Times correspond
ent sends daily from New York. "The public toleration of Congress," he
tells us this morning, "is a thing almost more disheartening than Con
gress itself." Why say anything so gratuitous and so offensive as that? If
Americans like to say it themselves, let them say it. But for the Times to
print this and much like it day by day as from the correspondent of a Brit
ish pÂ»per is to do mischief which is not easily repaired.â Westminster Ga

NEVER STRONG ON THE SEA.
But even when circumstances made her the first of naval powers Spain
was never equal to the task she undertook. A great Italian sailor se
cured for her the empire of the West. The fighting prowess of two great
military captains won for her Mexico and Peru. Her splendid armies con
quered Portugal and brought her the widest colonial dominion of the uge.
But it was not by sea that Spain won her supremacy, and not by naval
victories that she laid her grip on every quarter of the globe. Even when
her power and wealth seemed irresistible, when her military reputation
was at its height, when the world was strewn with her territories and the
ocean laden with her argosies and fleets, her real naval power was utterly
incommensurate with the astonishing pretensions which it made. As soon
as England and Holland laid a finger on it, her maritime empire crum
bled into dust. The Armada only revealed a fact which English sailors
had long suspected, and the consciousness of which explains Drake's sub
lime contempt for the menaces of Spain â the fact that, even at the zenith
of their fame, the Spaniards had no mastery of the arts by which the sea
is held. Is there on record a battle which shows that Drake and Blake
and Jervis and Nelson were mistaken in their low estimate of Spanish sea
men? Can any of us recall the name of a Spanish ad
miral of genius, or of any great Spanish naval victory since
Lepanto, which was won largely by Venetian crews? If we look at
the history of Spain since the Armada, we find only a succession of naval
disasters, a succession of triumphs for any state which has ventured to
grapple with the Spaniards on the Â°eas. Take the history of the seven
teenth century and follow the career of the Dutch admirals and of the
greatest of Nelson's predecessors, Blake. Take the eighteenth century
and notice how even Alberoni and Patino failed, with all their efforts, to
resuscitate the fleets of Spain. Take the modern war in Chile, and mark
how few antagonists Cochrane could find there worthy of his steel. Even
In the days of her greatest power at sea, Spain wae notoriously deficient
in the capacity of her sailors, and since those days she has steadily de
clined. To-day Spanish gunners and Spanish engineers are confessedly
among the worst in Europe. It would be little short of a miracle if it should
turn out that Spain, within the last two decades, had bred a race of sea
men capable of reversing the unvarying misfortunes of the past. It Is
when we consider the temper and traditions of the opposing nations, far
more than when we study their resources and their fleets, that we real
ize how little probability a war womd offer even of a transient Spanish
victory, and how much there is to justify the American people's expecta
tion that from the very beginning of the contest they would sweep thÂ»
Spaniards from the sea. â The Speaker.
PERU A HELL-LIKE REPUBLIC.
Teiklchi Tanaka of the Moiioka Shokai has lately returned home from
South America* He has brought home a contract agreed upon between
the Peruvian republic and his firm for the supply of 30,000 Japanese emi
grants. The terms are that the emigrants are to be males between 20 to
45 years of age, are to undertake farm work of ten hours a day, except on
Sundays and national holidays, and are to receive 25 yen per month. The
contract period will be four years. These are very favorable terris to Jap
anese and doubtless many emigrants will be forthcoming. But there Is an
other attraction. The Peruvians are said to be strong Japanophiles. A
law was In force i jiblddi. the marriage of Peruvian subjects with for
eigners, but this law Is said to have been repealed, specially in view of
encouraging the arrival of Japanese and their marriage with Peruvian wo
men. The President himself is a thorough lover of Japanese. He asked
Mr. Tanaka to bring, when the latter revisited the republic, a batch of
Japanese carpenters and other mechanics to build for him a model Japanese
house. The "Union Club," a club organized by fashionable gentlemen,
wanted to engage twenty Japanese boys to wait upon them at the club at
a monthly salary of $12 with food and clothing. All these are so tempting
that we needy editors at first were strongly inclined to cast away our
pen and to sail to Peru by the first ship. But a dismal tale about that
republic which a friend of ours submitted to us stopped us from taking the
rash step. This gentleman had been to Peru several years ago and stayed
there long enough *~ learn much about the country and the people. He
told us that Peru is a v>ry unhealthy country and the Peruvians are little
better than ruffians, th: horrible crimes are committed in broad daylight
and the police Itself is almost the den of robbers, that life and property are
in perpetual danger and that even the omnipresent Chinese do not dare to
penetrate into this hell-like republic. Maybe there is a little exaggeration
In this story but It is quite true that the republic is In a very unsettle*
state and the country Is very unhealthy. When we recall how some ten
years ago a big Japanese capital was invested In a certain silver mine and
went Into the pockets of some fraudulent Peruvians we can not free our
selves from the suspicion that there might be some fraud In the emigration
enterprise. It Is reported that the Morioka Shokai is contemplatine- sondin^
out to Peru as first batch 1003 emigrants by May next. It is hkhlv de
sirable that, before this is done, the Government will make a close- fnvpa
tlgatlon Into the matter.â The Hansel Zasshi (Japan).

FALLACIES OF THE CHARTER.
It 13 said by the advocates of the new
charter that: "We have now a governing
body of twelve members, and if we multi
ply it by ten, you get 120 of the same kind.
You take them from the same source and
must have the same result." BÂ»t, if we
divide the number by two or twelve, you
will still have six or one, also of the same
kind. You take them from the same
source and must also have the Bame re
sult. If the source of power is corrupt,
you simply concentrate corruption by re
ducing numbers. Now the fact is, there
is not a single instance where large pow
ers have been conferred upon a Mayor,
as in Brooklyn, Boston, Cleveland, In
dianapolis, Quincy, Cincinnati, and other
cities in which that power has not been
abused as often as any power possessed
by Supervisors, and the experience of
many cities has proved that It is easier
to elect a bad Mayor than a bad Board
of Supervisors, some of whom are certain
to be honest. Ail the machine has to do
is to concentrate its energies upon tha
election of a Mayor, which it does wnn
uniform success, except under conditions
of unusual excitement, or when the Mayor
is powerless. Under a storm of public
excitement, Seth Low was elected as a
model Mayor in Brooklyn. He was fol
lowed by Whitney, Chapln and Moody,
who were creatures of "Boss"' McLougn
lin. For eight successive years the city
suffered frightfully from corruption, ex
travagance, inefficiency and waste. In
Boston, Mayor after Mayor has been
elected, only to disappoint the hopes or
municipal reformers. The public debt was
increased, employes were hired at moro
than the market rate of wages, and the
neatest frauds in executive contracts
have been perpetrated by the Board 01
Public Works.
In Cleveland, the concentration of power
has not brought about the application of
business methods. In Cincinnati, Boss
Cox still rules the Mayor. Philadelphia,
under the Mayor and six of his appointees
as heads of departments, has the worst
government in the United States. This
city has not had a good Mayor since 1287.
Civil service rules are a dead letter. The
city is controlled by politicians, who live
on patronage and are both corrupt and
extravagant.
In Quincy, the author of the concen
tr.-i.tinj? charter admitted its failure, and
states that local jobbing and caucus poli-
I tics are as rampant as ever. Indianapolis
had a brand new charter of the San Fran
cisco type in 1891, which started up under
ideal conditions. Sullivan, Denny and
I Taggart have been the successive Mayors,
I and the last was re-elected last year.
Civil service and charter ordinances have
been systematically ignored. The offices
are filled for personal and partisan gain,
and before election three times the need
ed number of laborers were employed.
The Department of Public Works was in
vestigated, revealing gross inefficiency
and corruption in contracts arfd the exe
cution of puliHc works. Mayor Taggart
has made wholesale removals and reap
pointments in his own interest.
M.n are not trees, which by increased
number do not alter the nature of the
fruit. The fruit of associated numbers
is altogether different from that of a
small number or a single man. A large
number discourages corruption, for it is
more costly and difficult to buy 61 out of
120 than 7 out of 12 or 10 out of 18.
When men act together in a corporate
capacity their power is enormously in
creased, while that of the individual is
lost. This is the essential condition of all
good government. The greatest feature
in a city government is the appointing
power. In a corporate body, no one has
personal power to appoint hi? friends and
relatives or political associates. There is
no patronage and politics cannot count
on spoils. Patronage is the food of
"bosses." who cannot thrive without it.
The elected "bosses" barter their patron
age with Supervisors for more appro
priations, and with outside, "bosses" of
the Buckley stripe for electoral support.
Patronage is the main cause of corrup
tion and extravagance, nnd is the curse
of city government. It is perpetuated and
extended in the new charter. Under such
conditions there is no promise of im
provement, either in efficiency or econo

[ ROYAL â AKIWO fOWOER CO., NEW YO9K.MASONS' HIGH REVEL FOR CHARITY
CLEAR as an alpine horn thenoteÃofa
bugle rang out, then a wave of the
director's hand and the great doors
of Mechanics' Pavilion swung open
a 1 T o'clock last evening, and the Masonic
F< stival, Instituted in the cause of char
ity, was on. Ir. a mystic maze of color,
In a fairy land one can imagine, the festi
val was opened and there it will close,
but behind the doors will be left gold
enough to almost if not quite enough to
complete the home where the fatherless
and the penniless widows may live in com
fort and peace.
Shortly after the doors of the Pavilion
swung open the crowds begun to pour
into the building, and by 10 o'clock 10,000
poople were grouped about the booths.
Kvery one who came came in charity's
cause and had either a penny or an eagle
or perhaps more to arid to the growing
fund. From thousands of lipe came words
of praise for those who have the festival
in their charge, for the great amount of
labor they had expended in decorating
the hall and the booths and for their
last'- in that work. Overhead, stretched
across the great building, hang draperies
blue as the firmament and like the heav
enly todies of the night golden stars are
hung. Red. white and blue, blue and gold
predominate in the decorations below and
in between a kaleidoscope of rainbow
colors complete the picture, all except the
life that is added by daintily dressed
maidens and matrons, who with merry
laugh and jest sell their wares that the
poor may laugh and jest with them. Out
from behind the draperies of these daz
zling booths are maidens and matrons
also, and those who come to look remain
to buy, and not one plea for charity is
passed unhonored.
At a Quarter of 8 o'clock the clarion
notea of a cornet told that preparations
for the opening of the programme were
being hurried, and soon from a distant
wing of the building a column of march
ers, composed of the ladies in charge of
the booths, made its appearance and
started around the hall. In and out in
lines and figures they marched, and,
dressed in white gowns with dainty caps,
they made a picturesque but in no way
formidable appearance, quite different
from the boys in blue of the Fourteenth
Kegiment. who arrived yesterday from
Vancouver on their way to the front. Fol
lowing the march Bennet's band rendered
a selection, "Songs or' All Nations," and
then Charles I^. Patton took the stand
to deliver an address of welcome to the
Masons' assembled guests. The speaker
usked all to be merry and accept the hos
pitality of the lodge and to remember the
noble cause that had brought them to
gether. He spoke of th* waifs and widows
that needed shelter, comfort and protec
tion, and all evidently were in sympathy
with his views if the applause that fol
low* d can stand as a basis for judgment,
maa Flint Jr., grand master of the
I Lodge of California, followed Mr.

schools, dressc-d in white, here and there

reservation are but the advance
guard of the great column. Tele
grams were received from General
Merrlam yesterday announcing that two
light batteries of artillery and one troop
of cavalry from Utah will be Immediately
sent to San Francisco. A press dispatch
says that a regiment of infantry from
South Dakota has been ordered to this
city. General Merriam at last accounts
was at Vancouver hastening the work of
organizing the volunteer regiments of
Washington, Oregon and Idaho for con
centration at the Presidio.
Significant orders came from Washing
ton yesterday, and in compliance with â 
directions a recruiting office will be j
opened at army headquarters In the ;

Bight hundred artillerymen will be en
listed for the Third United States Artil- j
lery. The recruiting officer is First Lieu
tenant Delamere Skerrett, Third Artil
lery, U. S. A.
Recruits will be accepted on the same
terms regarding- discharge as the volun
teers obtain. At the close of the war j
honorable discharge will be granted to !
such men as apply. Some of the men will
probably go to the Philippines, while '
others will remain hero to man the de- \
fenses of this harbor. Of course, all will ;
be subject to orders sending them wher- i
ever their services may be necessary.
Each heavy battery of the regular serv
ice on a war footing will consist of one
captain, one first and two second lieuten- i
ants, one lirst sergeant, twenty-two ser
geants, ten corporals, two musicians,, two
artificers, one wagoner and 162 privates,
making a total of 203. This strength is an
expansion from a peace footing of 78.
To-day Lieutenant Skerrett, occupying
the spacious offices recently vacated by
the inspector-general of the Department
of California In the Phelan building, will
receive applications for enlistment. Sur
geons will be present to conduct the medi
cal examination. The artillery service
ranks high and since the enlistments are
on the same terms that the volunteers re
ceive, the best young men of the land
may respond. . â  , '

The dancing was pretty and pictur
esque, and the dancers, flushed with the
thought that they had added to the
pleasure of the guests and had added
their mite to aid a deserving cause,
mingled with the throng.
Notwithstanding the thousands of souls
that thronged the Pavilion there was but
little danger to life or limb. Squads of
i United States Cavalry, chief of the com
1 missary department for the volunteer
: regiments on the Presidio reservation,
: has on hand to-day 100,000 rations. Orders
go out to-day to issue to the volunteers
', field rations for ten days. It was said
at the Presidio yesterday that the suppli
ed fresh beef to the volunteers would be
continued until next Thursday. There
after bacon will take the place of fresh
beef.
The proposed plan of sending the Third
Artillery to the Philippines does not meet
with much favor among officers of high
grade. No better troops than the volun
teers can be had for the service at Manila,
while no troops short of three months'
training can take the place of the Third
Artillery in handling the high-power
euns defending this harbor. An officer of
high rank and wide experience said yes
terday: "Apart from the question of leav
ing San Francisco without adequate pro
tection from the enemy, it would be un
wise for the Government to place these
high-power breech-loading rifles and the
machinery connected therewith in the
hands of other than trained artillery
men and machinists. The Third Artil
lery, or men of equal skill in the man
agement of the guns, should remain here
to man the modern batteries. Let the
volunteers and the Fourth United States
Cavalry, and such regular infantry regi
ments as can be spared, go to the Phil
ippines."
The annexed order from headquarters at
Washington has been promulgated:
By direction of the Secretary of War the fol
lowing is published to the army for the Infor

Colonel Smith and his officers put In
another haM day's work yesterday in
getting the First Regiment in shape for
the expected call to Manila. From the
moment the drum called the reveille at
sunrise until taps sounded at 10 o'clock
and the men and officers turned in for
their well-earend rest the day was one of
hard work and busy preparation. The
raw recruits were given four drills, and
already they have made wonderful im
provement in the manual of arms and
marching exercises.
Colonel Smith is fast tightening the
reins upon his men, and they are begin
ning to realize that they areeommanded by
an officer who understands his duty and
knows how to conduct a camp upon
purely military lines. The first two days
Colonel Smith permitted a number of men
to leave camp, but hereafter only live
passes will be issued to each company a
day. There were a number of visitors
yesterday who wanted to see the men in
their quarters, but they were not allowed
to do so. The orders are that they may
visit the enlisted men on Tuesdays and
Friday*, in the afternoon, between 2 and 3
o'clock, and this order will be strictly en
forced. Colonel Smith says the encamp

one. All day long the companies might
be seen under the command of their offi

Captain Rethers had several additional
hospital tents erected yesterday as a pre
caution In case there should be need for
them. He does not anticipate an epidemic
among the men, but many of the minor
cases of sickness arc- such as require that
the soldiers should be kept where the sur
geon can keep an eye upon them and give
them close attention.
Regimental Quartermaster Dohrmann

shape, and he reports that the question
of rations for the men is now upon an ex

be no shortage in the supplies.

TOWN TROOPS
More Additions to the Men
in the Local Arm
ories,
The second of Lieutenant Colonel John
son's two battalions came down from
Stockton by boat yesterday morning and
went to quarters in California Hall on
Bush and Powell streets. Battery D of
the "heavies" came up from Los Angeles
and found resting place in the old First
Regiment armory on Market and Tenth
streets. The first battalion of Lieutenant
Colonel Johnson's command was exam
ined during the day and most of the sec
ond battalion was examined during the
night, and yesterday morning heavy bat
teries A, B and C, with their officers,
were mustered in as volunteers.
The Second Battalion, destined to be
the "Second Battalion, Volunteer Cali
fornia Infantry," had been assembled in
Stockton from all over the San Jouquin
Valley. Company E of Visalia, Company
C of Fresno and Company H of Merced
were brought to Stockton, where they
were joined by Company A of that place.
The men are fairly well equipped so far
as the equipments go, but it will take a
good deal to put them in proper trim.
Company F of Fresno is the only com
pany of the Sixth Infantry to be left at
home and the men of the organization are
consequently very much dissatislied. Its
place in the command has been taken by
Company E of Sacramento.
Battery D, under command of Captain
Henry Steere, came up from Los Angeles
direct, 155 strong. The men had not been
examined, but they had been carefully
picked and there will not be many re
jected. The battery will be mustered In
to-day, and then the battalion being
complete it will start to-morrow to quar
ters in the ola woolen mill at Black Point,
where the whole command may be easily
accommodated. The officers of the artil
lery battalion are: Major, Frank S.
Rice; battalion adjutant, First Lieuten

"Monbars," with its thrilling climaxes

company at the Columbia last evening, j
Ttie large audience showed its apprecia- |
tion throughout the evening by long and j
continued applause.
Man t ell's interpretation of the noble
hearted Frenchman won him an ovation.
Both Mantell and Miss Rosselle Knott
were called before the curtain by the en- I
thusiastic audience. Miss Knott's acting j
as Diane, the suspected wife, was grace- j
ful, and she showed marked ability.
Howard Hall's Laurent was good, and the j
other characters in the play were cleverly !
enacted. As Mr. Mantell was prevailed !

the city, it is expected that large audi
ences will attend every performance.
The California.
There is variety enough at thÂ© Cali
fornia this week to please the most fas
tidious. It is probably the supposition
of the management that there is not
quite enoug-h patriotism in "The Ensign,"
so there has been introduced the Drum
mer Boy of the Rappahannock with his
drums and his illustrated lecture between
acts to stir the feeling's of the audience
to a fighting pitch, and then they pre
sent a three-round go between Sharkey
and Baker as a sort of solace to their i
feeling.
Frederick Pauldlng, as the Ensign, does
some of his best work, and barring a
little too much facial contortion in the
last act, leaves nothing to be asked so
far as his rendition of the part is con
earned. He is well supported and the
company gives an even and smooth per
formance.

NORRIS BROTHERS'
Dog and Pony Show, at Central Park,
Is Growing in Popularity
Every Day.
The entertainment is certainly of a high
standard, and Norris Bros, deserve the
financial success with which they are
meeting. For the little ones especially
it is a show of unusual attractiveness.
The animals are well and humanely treat
ed, and seem to enjoy the performance
equally as well as the spectators.
There are dogs that perform difficult
balancing acts on chairs, ladders, tight
ropes, etc., while the lofty leaping of a
pack of ten English greyhounds is won
derful and exciting. The handsome little
Shetland ponies form a unique portion of
the entertainment. But probably the
most interesting feature of the pro
gramme is the work of the animal fire
department, which consists of a hook and
ladder, truck and hose wagons, drawn
by pretty little ponies, with dogs and
monkeys as firemen, engaging In a re
alistic fire scene.
Performances are given daily at 2:30
and 8:15 p. m. All children attending the
matinees are given a pony ride.
Failed to Appear.
Policeman Say was before the Police
Commissioners last night charged with
assaulting John Shaughnessy. The lat
ter failed' to appear, and the charge
against the officer was dismissed.
Say a short time ago entered a saloon
at 7C5 Howard street to quell a disturb
ance, when he was attacked by Shaugh
nfissy, who took his club away from him.
The policeman drew his revolver and
struck Shaughnesy over the head with it.
The following day Shaughnessy preferred
a charge of unofflcerlike conduct against
Say. After requesting frequent contin
uances Shaughnessy failed to appear last
night and the case was dismissed.
Hay is one of the most reliable officers
connected with the Southern station, and
Is held in high esteem by Captain Spil
lane.
The cases of Policemen Irvine. Whalen
and Silver, charged with engaging in a
row, were continued for two weeks.

EXPLANATION.
â¢ The arrow flies with the wind. The top fig
ures at station Indicate minimum temperature
for the days: those underneath it. If any, the
amount of "rainfall or of melted snow in Inches
and hundredths during the last twelve hours.
Isobars, or solid lines, connect points of equal
air pressure; isotherms, or dotted lines, equal
temperature. The word "high" means high
barometric pressure and is usually accompanied
by fair weather: "low" refers to low pres
sure and is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the Washington coast. When
the pressure is . high in the interior and low
along the coast, and the isobars extend north
and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is im
probable. With a "high" in the vicinity of
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Cali
fornia coast, warmer weather may be expected
in summer and colder weather in winter. The
reverse of these conditions will produce an
opposite result.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, May 9.â Probably to-day's j
sto^k market owed Its firmness and at some
points its strength to the extraordinary course
of prices In the wheat market. With May
wheat selling in this market at $1 70 a bushel
before the middle of the month and with July
option almost keeping pace with it. there is
assured promise of abundant increase of
wealth for this country- The outbreaks of vio
lence and bloodshed in Italy and Spain on ac
count of the dearness of bread and the ad
vancing price for that necessity at other points
in Europe are only too convincing evidence
that the high prices for wheat are not due to
speculative manipulation but to the urgent
r* â ! 01 for*Wjn conramera. With this demon
stration of the country's potential command ot
v. .II; :: v ,1- ij.iiural that prices of securities
should continue to advance. Hut the market
has to carry the burden of an extensive
liquidation of profits In many stocks and of
large selling for foreign account. Induced by
thâ¢ stillness of money rates abroad. There
was, besides, positive depression in some of
the stocks which are usually most prominent
In the market. With three such conspicuous
leaders as Sugar, Manhattan and Metropolitan
Street Railway suffering from special causes
of weakness, it was natural that some slight
depression should radiate from them through
the lift. Rock Island showed the most notable
strength of any railroad stock and St. Paul
â was also sustained. Otherwise the Grangers
was a good deal weighted by profit-taking
sales. There were some sharp gains In Peo
ple's Gas, Pacific Mail and Atchison. To
bacco loat all of its gain before the end of the
day. There was a general downward move
ment In the whole list of profit-taking ,and
bear pressure during the final hour, which
made the day's changes extremely irregular.
Prominent stocks are showing some important
gains and others equally prominent showed
showed marked losses.
The bond market shared in the activity of
stocks and was strong throughout. Total
sales. $3,170,000.

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, May 9 âThe Evening Post's
financial cablegram says: The stock markets
here opened dull to-day, but rapidly improved.
The recovery was led by a marked improve
ment in foreign bourses, notably in Paris. A
rumor spread that Spain was asking the pow
ers to Intervene. Nothing definite was known,
but the buying was so good and general that
color was given to the report. It must be
remembered, however, that the settlement will
begin to-morrow, therefore much of the im-
I prrvfrnent perhaps is due to bears covering.
Interest to-day centered in Americans, in
I which the business was unusually heavy. The
firm prices in New York induced realizing here,
which tho arbitrage dealers readily absorbed.
Subsequently the buying became more general,
the prices closing at the best. Operators have
apparently made up their minds that the war
â will not interfere with Americans, while the
recognized rise in wheat adds to the spending
power of the United States.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, May 9.â The Liverpool wheat
market excelled j all | previous efforts at start
ling advances by opening 7d higher for May,
and from 7d to 9d up for July compared with
Saturday's closing figures. > That ' set the Chi
cago wheat pit into a roar of nervous excite
ment at the opening. All sorts of prices were
paid for July simultaneously in different parts
of the pit. It was impossible for a few minutes
to get an Idea of what price was predominat
ing, but after awhile the opening range,, as
near as could -be. found out, was given at from
$1 09% 'â¢ to $1 ' 10%. v Trading - between : those
limits was enormous for two or three minutes,
but buying orders without limit to price poured
in. from outside, and -the price leaped upward
In great bounds, touching $1 14 for an instant.
The market rebounded to $1 11%. : Shorts saw
that their only chance to recoup was by doub
ling and price was no object. -Up shot quo
tations again, touching $1 16, ten minutes af
ter the opening. Another reaction to $1 13% fol
lowed, but offerings were greedily absorbed,
and the market gradually â â¢ settled down around
$1 15. " Trading in | May began , at \Sc advance.
Leiter sold a little at . $1 75, : causing a reaction
t'i $1 70. which, i however, quickly recover
ed. After a brief rest at $1 15 the buying furor
was renewed. -A" wild scramble of â  European
nations I for American breadstuffs â  was conclu
sively shown by.- the announcement of fresh bids
to Leiter for two million bushels of red wheat.
Up to the close !he had : not accepted ' the offer,
but reported other sales of 350,000 bushels to go
abroad. The Liverpool market 'at the close
showed gains of 6d ; for spot and 2%@9d for fu
tures. Paris and Antwerp accentuated the Eu
ropean shortage by advancing 5c each. Near
the end of the session offerings became scarcer
than ever, and ' July rushed up to $1 21, easing
off at the close to $1 20Vi. September, which
sold early, at 89c, was rushed up to 96c, and
closed 7c net higher at 94* c. No failures were
reported on 'Change, but margin calling was
eharp.
Corn was active, and shortscover ed freely
with the strength of wheat as an Incentive.
May gained 2%c, July 2c.
â¢ Oats were . neglected, but on , moderate â  cov
ering advanced about lc. ' . â  ' â

There were lively times In the Wheat pit
yesterday morning. At Chicago the bull clique
ran May Wheat up to $1 75 per bushel and July
from $1 06% up to $1 21. The foreign markets
were also stiff at a pronounced advance. Of
course these conditions set this market boom
ing, and December, which closed Saturday at
$1 72*, ran up to $1 80, with heavy transac
tions. This price did not hold, however, and
quotations shaded off under sharp opposition
by the bears.

HAY AND FEEDSTUFF 3.
Yesterday was a great day in Hay. Tho re
ceipts were only 650 tons, but 330 of this was j
: from Oregon and 60 from Utah. This gives a
' fair idea of the flood being poured Into this 1
market from outside points. Owing to some
delay in transportation It is all coming in at |
j once and the market has broken in conse
1 quence. However this outside influx is not
likely to last long, for the shippers are all j
t losing money on it. They calculated, when j
they shipped, to get from $20 to $25 for it,
whereas it Is hard to sell at $14 to $18. as It is
1 inferior to our Hay. As soon as It Is worked j
; off the situation will probably clear.

George Nail, superintendent of the Sun
day school of the Thirty-fourth street
Methodist church, has been charged by
certain members of the congregation with
unbecoming conduct as a church officer.
The charges have been formally drawn
up, signed and presented to the pastor,
Rev. Charles F. Brown, and a trial has
been ordered to take place next Monday
night.
The nature of the accusation is very
serious, and Mr. Nail emphatically denies
it all and has engaged an attorney to
defend him before the officers of the
church, and declares that the responsi
bility for heaping this humiliation upon
him will be traced to its origin and that
he will have substantial satisfaction.
The paper containing the charges was
drawn up by some of the members of the
congregation, and it sets forth that some
time last year Mr. Nail called in the
afternoon on Mrs. Hattie F. Long, a mar
ried woman, at her house at Twenty
eighth and Union streets, and that his
conversation was not such as is expected
from the superintendent of a Sunday
school. The details of the conversation
are not given, but it is stated that Mrs.
Long will tell her story on the witness
stand at the trial.
Another charge brought against Mr.
Nun ia that on one occasion he paced
back and forth before the Long household
in a manner annoying to Mrs. Long and
that such conduct is also unbecoming an
officer of the church. These charges were
submitted to the pastor, Rev. Charles F.
Brown, and he took steps to have them
Investigated at a regular church trial, but
he will not preside himself, having dele
gated that Important task to Rev. A. T.
Is'eerlham of East Oakland.
Much surprise has been expressed that
these charges, which are dated in the fall
of last year, have been allowed to remain
so long before being brought openly. At
the time mentioned in the complaint Rev.
Mr. Jones wus pastor of the church and
nothing was heard of the matter until
after he was succeeded by Rev. Mr.
Brown, Since the coming of Mr. Brown
there has been a renewal of the unpleas
antness that existed three years ago,
when Rev. Mr. Van Emery left the
church. This trouble has broken out in
various forms and the present trial of Mr.
Nail is one of them. The present pastor,
Mr. Brown, has frequently clashed with
Mr. Armstrong, secretary of some of the
church societies, and a few weoks ago
this trouble broke out openly. Each gen
tleman said some peculiar things of the
other, and no doubt the notoriety added
fuel to the existing fire, for in the pres
ent Instance Mr. Armstrong is said to be
one of the warmest defenders of Mr. Nail.
This afternoon Mr. Nail came into Oak
land and laid the matter before Judge
11. D. Talcott and engaged that gentle
man to attend the trial in his behalf.
Judge Talcott will demand that the pro
ceedings be conducted openly and will
have a stenographic report made so that
if occasion is taken by gosslpers to tell
idle tales he will be prepared to act in
the pn-miFesi.
If the verdict of the church court is not
favorable to Nail he will take an appeal
from the district conference to the gen
eral conference, which meets at Pacific
Grove this fall. One of the friends of Mr.
Nail says that if the charges were true
it is rather strange that some very posi
tive action has not been taken before this
time fur the husband of Mrs. Hattie Long,
whom it is alleged was insulted by the
Sunday school superintendent.
MRS. BTJNNELL RESIGNS.
Ibell Club Divided as to the Cause
of Her Withdrawal.
I have presented my resignation to the
board of directors. No action has been
taken and I do not know when it will
be. The board may not meet for some
time. I have had all the honor. If there
la any. in the presidency, and we have a
number of women capable of filling the
position. A new board has Just been
elected consisting of the brightest w-im^n
of the organization, and I am sure a
number of them are capable of presid
ing over the Ebell in such a manner as
to give perfect satisfaction. This month
is the end of the year. Xext month Is
vacation. Nothing new is being at
tempted, but the club is prosperous and
In a good condition. Some other presi
dent can take up the work now. and it
will be better for all concerned." â State
ment o* Mrs. A. W. Eunnell, president
of the Ebell Club.
OAKLAND, May 9.â Mrs. A. W. Bun
nell, president of the Ebell Society, has
resigned, and her resignation is now in
the hands of the board of directors. Mrs.
H. B. Pinney, another of the most active
of the board, has also tendered her resig
nation. Both actions were taken at the
meeting of the directors last Friday, but
the board declined to pass upon either of
them, and every effort is being made to
induce their withdrawal, but so far with-
out success.
For eight years Mrs. Bunnell has been
president of the Ebell, and each succeed
ing election haa shown that she was the
favorite of h large majority of the four
hundred members. Naturally every one
Is curious to know the reasons that have
led up to her taking the present decisive
stand. Opinion is about evenly divided
as to the cause. Some declare that it is
the result of the strictures passed on the
club by Mrs. John F. Swift two weeks
ago. when she was the guest of the Ebell;
others declare that the resignations have
been caused by tha election of Mrs. Gran
ville Abbott to the presidency of the Red
Cross League.
As Mrs. Bunnell declines to discuss the
matter the exact reasons for her resigna
tion may never be known.
Tho Â£S g ? liir f Â°rtnlghtly luncheon of the
Ebell Club takes place to-morrow after
noo,n v, and r h " m^tter of the president's
and Mrs. Plnneya resignation will no
doubt be thoroughly dissected

Adams Settles With Townley.
OAKLAND, May 9.â The litigation over
the construction of the bulkhead in front
of the Adams property on the estuary is
at an end. To-day a satisfaction of judg
ment was filed in the suit of John A.
Townley vs. Edson F. Adams. This is the
case in which the cost of extra piiingi
and the deductions for the giving way of
the bulkhead was at stake. Some time
ago a sensational paper made great ado
because an attachment made against Mr.
Adams in this case was returned Indorsed
no funds or property on which it could
be served, attempting to make it appear
that he was bankrupt.
DR. DILLE COMES
IN FOR WRATH
Ladies Are Indignant at His
Strictures Upon Fabiola
Day.
Many Prominent Women Hold That
His Position la the Reverse of
U nassa il able.
OAKLAND, May 9.â The condemnation
by Dr. Dllle on the Fabiola day at the
racetrack has been widely discussed in
Oakland to-day. While some parts of the
doctor's address are acknowledged to be
incapable of denial, there are one or
two paragraphs that have aroused great
indignation. One of these is the follow
ing:
I have no doubt any saloon or gambling hell
in Oakland would give the ladles a night's re
ceipts if they would stand behind the bar and
mix drinks, or preside at the gaming table;
and I should like to be informed In what re
spect this Derby day is morally on a higher
plane.
Another paragraph to which the ladles
take objection is that in which Dr. Dille
says: "If Mr. Williams wishes to make
a donation to the Fabiola why does he not
do so outright? Why does he require the
managers to so advertise and approve his
gambling scheme that they become parti
ceps criminis In every crime it produces,
and so that, if their sons are ruined by it,
they are estopped from any protest?"
Mrs. Yule, president of Fabiola, says
she does not understand wherein is any
difference between obtaining a donation
from the racetrack by means of Fabiola
day and the following of Dr. IMlie's sug
gestion and accepting a donation outright
lrom Mr. Williams.
"In any event," says Mrs. Yule, "if Fa
biola is to be benefited by a day's receipts
at the racetrack, I think it is actually
more straightforward to have aji open
day known as Fabiola day and to adver
tise and work for it as such than to take
a check for an equal amount from Mr.
Williams quietly and say nothing about
it. The money in either case would come
from the same source, and I cannot see
wherein lies the justification for Dr.
Dille's criticism. Regarding some parts of
his address I do not care to speak."
Mrs. William Letts Oliver said to-day:
"It's a case of sour grapes. The ladles
onlyl share the gate money. They have
nothing to do with bookmaklng. I see
nothing to warrant Dr. Dille's criticism.
I think Dr. Dille may some day ask the
favor of the same people that he is now
abusing."

HE FOUNDED THE ORPHEUM.
Gustav Walter, Father of Vaudeville in the West,
Suddenlu Passes Awau,
Gustav Walter, founder of the vaudeville business on the Pacific Coast
and principal owner of the Orpheum, died at the Waldeck Sanitarium at 4
o'clock yesterday morning, whither he had been removed from his home for
the purpose of being operated on for appendicitis. He had been ill but
four days, and death was farthest from his fears until the very last.
Mr. Walter was one of the best-known amusement managers in the
United States, having achieved success in everything he undertook. He
recentl- established branches in Kansas City, Sacramento, Los Angeles
and St. Louis, and made contracts for the building of a vaudeville house
in Omaha.
The following extracts from a biographical sketch of the dead man,
which appeared In an Orpheum souvenir a few years ago, will give a fair
Idea of the vast work accomplished by the sterling manager:
"In the little town of Osterode, which nestles among the historic Harta
Mountains, the Olympus of Germany, Gustav Walter first saw the light. He
was the youngest of seventeen children, and the revolutionary year of
1848 witnessed his birth. Walter's family was an old one in the little city,
and for generations the business of leather manufacturing had been hand
ed down from sire to son, but the young man finding the field limited went
to the seaport city of Bremen to become a merchant. He soon tired of the
dull routine of a merchant's life, however, and in 1865 decided to try his for
tunes in America. He found a congenial berth for sime time In New
York, with Fuchs & Heubner, flour and provision dealers of high standing;
but In 1874 the spirit of enterprise Induced him to come tn San Fran
cisco. Here he spent six years in the employ of William Ehrenpfort, the
carpet dealer, as head bookkeeper, but his busy brain kept turning over
schemes by which to amuse the public, his idea being to start a family
theater at popular prices, and about 1880 he opened a resort known as the
Fountain, in the Thurlow block, on Rearny street. Realizing the fact that
the San Francisco public were steady patrons of sterling attractions, his
next venture was in the Vienna Gardens. In turn he guided the fortunes
of the Wigwam for some time, with good success, but in 1886-87 his powers
of organization were concentrated toward establishing a place of amuse
ment second to none in the country, and San Francisco's great music hall,
the Orpheum, was the result. From this point on the history of Gustav
Walter and the house he established have been closely linked. The build
ing was commenced in November, 1886, and auspiciously opened June 30,
1887, being one of the greatest artistic events recorded in the annals or
the Western stage. On this date Kosner's Electric Orchestra, brought
from Buda Pesth, Hungary, at a cost of six thousand dollars, made its ap
pearancÂ»."
The Orpheum has been a grand success from the day it was opened, and
the genius of its founder has appeared at every step of its progress. Mor
ris Meyerfeldt. who has long been Intimately associated as a partner in the
Orpheum, will assume the general management.
Judge Troutt made an order last evening granting special letters of ad
ministration on Walter's estate to Morris Meyerfeldt. The letters were
granted at the request of Mrs. Josephine Walter, the widow, who sets
forth in the petition that the estate will exceed $10,000. Meyerfeldt's bonda
were fixed at $20,000.
The Orpheum will be closed until Wednesday night out of respect to
the memory of its founder.

Both Gas and Electricity.
The official conduct of Mrs. Walsh,
matron of the City Prison, i 3 to be in
vestigated. The basis of the charges
made against her at the meeting of the
Supervisors yesterday was published in
The Call of Sunday to the efTect that she
grossly and habitually neglected her
duties.
Supervisor Clinton, after calling- atten
tion to the article published, moved that
the matter be referred for investigation,
to the Hospital Committee.
Supervisor Devany showed his patriot
ism, or rather his animosity toward Spain,
by introducing a resolution providing that
the name of Balboa boulevard be changed
to Dewey. Mayor Phelan made a few re
marks in defense of the discoverer of the
Pacific Ocean, saying it would be display
ing great narrow-mindedness to attempt
to take away from the honor due the
great Spaniard who first brought to the
notice of civilization the broad waters of
the Pacific. He declared that the Span
lards of old should not be made to suffer
f<>r the misrule of the modern nation. On
motion of Supervisor Clinton the resolu
tion went over until next Monday.
Bids for lighting pumic buildings were
opened. The bids for gas were $1 50 per
1000 feet and were made by the San Fran
cisco Gas and Electric Company and the
Pacific Gaa Improvement Company. These
bids are 10 cents per 1000 feet less than paid
last year. The San Francisco Gas and Elec
tric Company was the only bidder for
supply electric lights. Its bid was 10
cents per 1000 watts for all buildings except
the outside police stations. For the latter
15 cents per 1000 was bid. The old rate, is
11 cents for all buildings. All bids were
referred to the Light Committee.

An insurance and collection agent In Otsego County,
New York, constantly recommends Ripans Tabules to every-
body whom he suspects of suffering from dyspepsia, and takes
pleasure in relating his own expei*fence, as follows : " I have
been a sufferer from dyspepsia for a dozen years or more, and
have tried all kinds of medicines that were said to be gt>od (or a
positive cure), but none of them afforded much relief. I have
always been blessed with a keen appetite and have, perhaps, in-
dulged too heartily at times and suffered accordingly. Last
winter while traveling through an adjoining county I first
learned of Ripans Tabules, and was induced by a friend to try
them. They have done me a great deal of good, and I think
that I have fair promise of a permanent cure. If I would be
regular about my meals now, I am sure I should be well."

A SHINING MARK.
The Tribute That Humbug Pays to
Honesty and Merit.
A clever counterfeiter does not sit up
nights to imitate the bonds of a bank
rupt corporation. Knavery, like death,
loves a shining mark. It nays to merit
and prosperity the complimentof copy
ing them, so far as externals are con
cerned, in the hope of deluding the
public.
In the world of commerce articles of
proven worth are most frequently
counterfeited. Duffy's Pure Malt
Whiskey, for example, is a medicinal
stimulant of l.i<^h reputation. Phy
sicians commend it, and the prudent
housewife keeps it in her chest of fam
ily remedies. Mere advertising could
never have raised this whiskey to the
place it occupies. Its own qualities
put it there.
That it should be imitated is no
more than one would expect. Readers
of this newspaper are strenuously
urged, for their own sake, to make
sure that they get the genuine article,
made by the Duffy Malt Whiskey Co.,
of Rochester, X. V., and by nobody
else. All sorts of lying representations
are devised to induce people to buy
substitutes. You may be told of some
dreadful concoction, made of heaven
only knows what, that it is in every
way as good as Duffy's Pure Malt. The
tradesman who says such a thing
does not deserve your natronage. Re
fuse all substitutes for Duffy's.

HUNTINGTON
AGAIN ON
THE RACK
Called Before Commis
sioner Heacock as
a Witness.
Troubled With a Faulty
Memory on Pertinent
Matters.
Lays Claim to Good-Natured
Acts and Hopes for
Reward.
A GOOD TRADE IN STOCKS.
Light on the Manner in W'hloVi tho
Southern Pacific Company
Is Operated.
C. P. HuntinÃton appeared before I
United States Commissioner Heacock yes
terday as a witness in the suit brought ',
by the Southern Pacific Company apatnst
the State Board of Railroad Commission- ;
ers to enjoin them from putting Into ef- i
feet the order reducing the tariff on the ;
company's lines in this State. Attorneys ;
Garber and Foulks appeared for the rail- ,
road company and Attorney-General ;
Fltzperald and Attorneys Foote and ;
Hayne represented the State.
The examination of Huntington, which j
was conducted by the Attorney-General j
â¢was directed along the same lines as were ;
pursued by the Railroad Commissioners |
last week. Ac before. Huntingdon showed '<
himself to be an adept at dodging ques- i
tlons touching on matters connected with ;
the cost of the roads under hisconrtol.and j
as a result the examination was product- |
lye of very little information on this sub
ject.
About the organization and objects of
the Southern Pacific Company of Ken
tucky tne case was different. In spite of \
numerous evasions and lapses of memory !
the witness was forced to admit that this
company, with its present capital stock
Of $150 000.000, haw no property or assets
at the time of its organization except a :
cum somewhat less than $10,000, necessary
for the expenses connected with the pro
curement of its charter.
The company is now the owner of all or
the property of the Southern Pacific sys
tem of railroads, it having acquired this j
property by the exchange of its stock,
which was worthless, for the stock of the ;
various roads of the system on the basis '
of six shares of company stock for ten
shares of railroad stock. This was a
stroke of financiering worthy, the witness
thought, of the lasting gratitude of the
people of California. j
"What was the amount of the original
Stock issue of the Southern Pacific Com-
Buy of Kentucky," asked the Attorney-
General.
"I cannot remember the exact amount.
It was very smallâ just sufficient to cover
the expenses of procuring a charter." j
"Will your books show the amount of j
the original stock issue and what was ;
done with the money?"
"I am not sure that they would. I am
not much of a bookkeeper. I suppose the
expenditure of the money would be
charged to the general expense account In
a lump sum." I
The Attorney-General then attempted j
to get some information from the witness ;
regarding the original cost of the Oregon
and California Railroad. Huntington was j
willing to tell all he knew, but it tran
spired that all that he could remember
was that the road was bunt through a ;
very rough country and that the work i
was undertaken that the good people of !
this State might be benefited.
"What I want to got at is the cost to
your company of this road," persisted i
Fitzgerald.
"I don't think I can give you a satlsfac- j
tory reply to that question." blandly re- j
plied the witness. "We have done so j
many things for the benefit of California
that it is hard to remember them all. We
have not helped ourselves much as yet, ;
but we hope to in time."
"Then you cannot tell us what this road
cost you?'
"No, I don't believe that I can. As I
said before I am very much pleased with i
what we have done in California. We
have done so many good-natured things
here â I hope we will reap some reward
some day."
The Attorney General again recurred
to the cost of securing a franchise for ]
the Southern Pacific Company. Huntington |
could not remember the items but thought !
that the greater part of the money must :
have been paid out for legal expenses, j
He confessed to an utter lack of knowl- j
edge regarding legal services, but paid ne j
knew a few things about other things, i
""When we first began to build rail- !
roads," he explained. "1 said to Crocker, i
'You look out for the legal part of the ,
business and I will attend to the moral.' "
Fitzgerald again attacked the list of
California railroads in an effort to elicit
from the witness some facts as to their
cost. Huntington could not remember.
"I will do all that I can to assist you
in finding out," he said, "but I must con
fess that I do not see how it is to be
done. I would like to have the information
myself. Now in Virginia where I have
built railroads they never ring the bell
to know what I am doing. They are con
tent to believe that I am doing all that
I can under the circumstances. I hope
to Inspire the people of this State with
the same feeling in the course of time."
Huntington also stated that about twen
ty of the thirty-five roads that go to
make up the so-called Pacific system had
been acquired at a very small cost be
cause they had become bankrupt under
the management of their original owners.
Notwithstanding this he said he thought
his company should be given credit for
the entire original cost of the roads be
sides what had been spent on them since
they had been acquired by -the Southern
Pacific Company. The Attorney General
then called the attention of the witness
to the fact that the stock of the South
ern Pacicfic Company of California and
the Southern Pacific Comnany of Arizona
had been traded to the Southern Pacific
Company of Kentucky on the basis of six
shares of the comnany stock for ten
shares of the railroad stock, in spite of
the. fact that the California lines paid
large net profits while the Arizona lines
were operated at a loss.
"Do you consider," he was asked, "that
the stock of the Southern Pacific Com
pany of Arizona is of the same value as
the stock of the Southern Pacific Com
pany of California?"
"Well, I should hardly think so."
"Then why did you make the trade on
the same basis?'"
"That is a hard question to answer so
that you would fully understand me.
There are so many things that enter into
the subject that I hardly know how to
make myself understood. Future pros
pects and all that must be taken into
consideration, but I really do not think
that I could explain so that you would
understand."
An adjournment was taken until this
morning, the Attorney General remark
ing that the work of the day had been
merely preliminary.
Stenographer Olsen on Trial.
The trial of J. B. Olson, a stenographer,
formerly employed in Judge Low's court,
who is accused of having sworn falsely
to demands drawn on the city treasury,
was postponed in Judge Cook's court yes
terday owing to the sickness of one of the
jurors.

READY FOR THE

Ocean Liners and River
Boats Preparing for
the Rush.
A Big Fleet Will Leave Hero and
the Sound for Dawson
Next Month.
Ttio Schooner Bungor From SalÂ»
verry Had a Narrow Escape
While Making Port.
The rush to the gold fields via Dyea and ,
Skaguay is about over and the stampede ;
I via St. Michael and the Yukon is about
| to begin.
Nearly two-thirds of the vessels en- j
gaged in the Dyea traffic have either
been hauled off and put into other service
or else have been laid up for the time j
being. A few more weeks will see the i
j opening of the Yukon, and then the rush
via that route will be all the greater be
cause of the temporary stoppage of j
travel by the other way. Preparations
! to handle the passengers and freight have
been very extensive, and unless the rush ;
is up to expectations some one will be j
sure to have his fingers burned before j
the season Is over. The number of river ;
i boats constructed and ready to be sent i
i to the Yukon will surprise anybody who i
: will give the matter a moment's thought.
! though.
Max Kalish, agent of the steamer Hum
â  boldt, who returned from Seattle yester- '
I day, says there is a line of stern-wheelers :
i a mile long on Puget Sound awaiting the i
' lirst opportunity to descend upon St.
Michael. At least twenty of the same
, class of vessels have been built or are
being completed at Dutch Harteor, and
' probably two dozen or more will go up
! irom here. Of course many of these ves
1 sels will carry private expeditions, but ,
i even taking that fact into consideration
i there will certainly be river boats enough
! and to spare to handle the biggest kind â¢
' of a rush to the Klondike, this season.
The steamer Connemaugh arrived from
New York yesterday with a general
i cargo, and as soon as that is discharged
1 she will be turned into a Klondike pas
j senger steamer. The Ohio and the L,ee
lanaw are already in port and partially :
1 discharged, while the Illinois is expected
here in a few days. All these vessels are
to be added to the Klondike fleet, and
coupled with the steamers St. Paul, Sen
ator, Samoa, Chas. Nelson, Dlrlgo and
j Morgan City, will make a big increase to
I the list of vessels that went north last |
year.
Sailing vessels are being pressed Into
service to carry supplies to vessels built
' at Dutch Harbor and also to those that
wintered at the mouth of the Yukon. The
longshoremen on the schooner Joseph
1 Russ have been working night and day
in order to get her discharged and loaded
for St. Michael, while the J. M. Coleman
i is also being got ready, and the Etnel
â  Zane is being anxiously looked for In
order to put her on the berth. The Bangor
' was to have been loaded here, but as coal
: and lumber are wanted at St. Michael at
' once, she has been sent to Seattle to get
her cargo, in order to expedite matters.
The bark Rufcs E. Wood is also on the
i berth for St. Michael. Inside of a month ,
'. there will be more craft of every descrip- ;
\ tlon heading for the Yukon t..an ever be- ;
â  fore in the river's history-
The steamer Excelsior was chartered
yesterday from the Pacific Steam Whal
ing Company by the Alaska-Yukon
i Transportation Company. She will run i
i to St. Michael In conjunction with the |
i National City and Albion, and will con
nect at that point for Dawson City with
' the company's four new river steamers.
The steamer Humboldt, now running
i between this port and Dyea and Skaguay,
! will make one more trip from Seattle to
j Skagiiay and will then come here and go
! on the St. Michael route.
The schooner Bangor had a narrow ;
escape while making port a few days ago. |
j She came from Salaverry, and her crew ;
I did not know that the whistling buoy had '
! been replaced by the lightship and that (
i Duxberry reef Is now marked by the '
i former. She made the offlng in a thick '
j fog, and her master, taking bearings
' from the whistling buoy, laid a course tor
! the Golden Gate. The captains on one of
the pilot-boats, who happened to be in
the vicinity, hailed the vessel and asked
her crew where they were going. The â 
' changes in the buoys were then explained
'â  to Captain Asp, the schooner's command- ;
' er and he at once changed his course.
I Had he held on to the one he was steer-
I ing the Bangor would have been run high
and dry on the rocks.
An Italian named John Risso owes his
life to the promptitude of Henry Peterson. !
' Early yesterday morning he wandered .
: down to the Folsom-street wharf and
tumbled overboard. Peterson heard his
1 cries for help and went to the rescue, j
After getting the half-drowned man on j
the float Peterson called up the Harbor i
I Receiving Hospital and sent Risso there ;
I in the ambulance.
The bark R. P. Rithet arrived from
; Honolulu yesterday with v cargo of sugar
1 and several passengers. Among them
| were Mrs. J. L. Travis, wife of a Hodo
i lulu newspaper man; Miss Helen Wilder :
! and Miss Mary Jo*hnson, a nurse. Miss
! Wilder has been on the sick list, and i
i made the voyage for her health. She will
remain in San Francisco for a few weeks,
'< and then may go to China for a visit.
Probably Richard Murphy.
An unknown man was found lying dead
yesterday afternoon in a lumber-yard on
the corner of Seventh and Hooper streets.
He was evidently a laborer and about 45
years old. On his person were found a
rosary a bottle of liniment and a permit
for Richard Murphy to visit the Presidio
to look for work as a laborer.

MILLIONAIRE C. ELWOOD BROWN
SUED FOR BREACH OF PROMISE
One Hundred Thousand Dollars Demanded in the Sensational
Complaint of Mrs. Alta Humphrey, a Shrewd
Chicago Widow. .
Amatory Passages Contained in an Alleged Stack of Sixty Love Letters,
Business-Like Wooing of a Married Man at Long
and Close Range.
A very unwelcome surprise was given
C. Elwood Brown yesterday afternoon
by the filing: of a suit in the United
States Circuit Court against him by
Emmons & Emmons, attorneys, in be
half of Mrs. Alta Humphrey, who de
mands, $100,000 damages for breach o-f
promise. Mr. Brown is rated as a capi
talist, and is known as a mining opera
tor and ranch-owner. He is a married
man. and hence the suit of Mrs.
Humphrey is doubly embarrassing.
Mrs. Humphrey is a widow hailing
from Michigan, but her home has for
the last year or two been in Chicago,
where she has been carrying on a real
estate and general commission busi
ness, more especially in the handling of
mining stocks. Her husband died about

twelve years agr>, leaving her in com
fortable circumstances, and she has by
shrewd trading and good investments
considerably increased her estate. She
is rather an attractive brunette, is 33
years of age, and mother of a son and
daughter.
It was through a mining advertise
ment that Mr. Brown and the Widow
Humphrey became acquainted at long
range by correspondence â he in San
Francisco and she in Chicago. Later on
they met in the latter city. A stack of
over sixty letters written by Mr. Brown
will be produced in evidence, and it is
Intimated that they will make very in
teresting reading. The correspondence
opened in February of last year regard
ing the selling of stock of the Gowamis
Mining Company. A few weeks later
Mr. Brown mingled affection with busi
ness.
"I sat for a photo for you to-day," he
wrote her on May 10. Incidentally he
told her he did not know how much he
was worth. He said that he owned
several ranches, mines, etc., the latter

May 12 he enclosed his picture in a
letter to the widow, in which he- asked
her, "Do you live at a hotel or with
friends in Chicago, and can we be by
ourselves much of the time when I go
there?"
In June â the month of roses â he wrote
her that he "felt a deep and affection
ate interest in her," and hoped to see
her next month. A few days later he
indulged in this little outburst in his
amatory correspondence: '"I dare say
we could learn to love each other
dearly. I carry your little picture with
me when I go into the country, and
when lonely I study it." He asks her
to tell him truly whether she has an
other lover, as he has not heard from
her as frequently as usual. He desires
an answer to this leading question.
MRS. ALTA HUMPHREY.
C. EL WOOD BROWN, the well-known capitalist and mining man, has
been sued for breach of promise of marriage by Mrs. Alta
Humphrey, a pretty brunette of Chicago, who is also a widow
of determined and business-like habits. She says she has scores
of racy letters from her erstwhile adorer, and thinks $100,000
would be a fitting balm for her outraged feelings. Mr. Brown,
who is a married man, is not saying much.
"I may as well know it," he says, "and
save making a wild goose chase."
The widow, In anticipation of Mr.
Brown's visit to Chicago, had admon- j
Ished him not to expect too much of ;
of her, to which he is said
to have written in .reply: "What j
I know of you I admire, and I see no j
reason why we can't grow fond of j
each other. You say you are not beau- j
tiful, for which I am heartily thankful, i
We have beautiful 'women' enough |
here, but one can't trust them (as a !
rule) across the street." Mr. Brown
then refers to the case of Mrs. Brad
bury, whom he scores for running i
away from her elegant Los Angeles j
home with "a good-for-nothing Eng- I
lishman." "We ought to tar and feath
er him," he writes, "and spank her.
She is a typical Native Daughter."
Again he assures the widow of his re- i
Bponsibility, telling her that he values |
his holdings in lands and mining prop- I
erty at several million dollars.
Mr. Brown went to Chicago in July
and remained there about a month,
during which period it is al
leged he was frequently in the
society of Mrs. Humphrey, of
whom he became very fond, and ac
cording to the widow's story proposed
marriage and was accepted. At the
same time that Brown was making love
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 10, 1898.
he was also full of business and mak
ing money. He sold Mrs. Humphrey
stock of the Gowanus Mining Company
to the extent of 5200, agreeing later
on, in a letter, to repurchase it and
pay her 7 per cent interest, if she be
came dissatisfied with her investment
or could not dispose of it.
Returning to San Francisco Mr.
Brown continued to correspond with
Mrs. Humphrey, who, however, one day
suspected that there was something
queer in his transactions with her.
She noticed that the signature on the
Gowanus certificate of stock was "C.
Elwood Brown," while the name signed
to the letters was "Cryil Brown," but
the handwriting being the same. Brown
explained the discrepancy by stating
that C. Elwood Brown was his cousin.
The day for the marriage came, but
Mr. Brown, it is said, failed
to appear in the role of the
bridegroom. The disappointed widow
wrapped herself in a robe of
g-loom and would not be consoled with
the excuse that Mr. Brown was pre
vented from keeping his engagement
by press of important business mat
ters. She offered to come to San Fran
cisco to have the nuptials performed,
but Mr. Brown put her off from time
to time. Mrs. Humphrey's suspicions
and wrath were at last fully aroused
and patience having ceased to be a
virtue she consulted a firm of Chicago
lawyers, who instituted an investiga
tion through Emmons & Emmons of
this city. It was learned that Cyril
Brown and C. El wood Brown were one
and the same person: that he was a
man of wealth and married, his resi
dence being 3201 Pacific avenue, where
h^ lives in elegant style. He waa iden
tified by his -photograph, which the de
ceived widow had forwarded.
Mrs. Humphrey arrived in San Fran
cisco early last week and went Into
hiding, her residence being known only
to her lawyers. A day or two lat^r suit
was brought in Justice Groesinger's
court against Brown to recover $219 20
on tho mining stock investment. The
nfxt step was the filing of the damage
suit for breach of promise. In her com
plaint Mrs. Humphrey alleges that she
was utterly ignorant of the fact that
Brown was a married man until the
month of April. IS9B. It was on the 9th
of August, 1897. she states, that Brown
contracted to make her his wife.
Judge Morrow Indignant.
Another step was taken In the Circuit
Court yesterday morning in the tedious
litigation In which the Woodbridge Canal
and Irrigation Company is interested.
Judge Morrow announced to the attor
neys and all others having interests in
the case that on Monday next he would
!ix an upst-t price for the property and
that there should be no further delay to
the sale. Judge Morrow refused to allow
the receiver to put in a bid for his fees
and costs, and remarked that it was a
Hhame and a scandal that the property
could not be disposed of. He aid not pro
pose to allow the property to be sold for
a song, and on Monday next he would
designate the price for which it should be
sold. The litigation has been in progress
for the past four years.

foria.

READY TO SAIL
ON SATURDAY
The City of Peking Ar
rives and Will Prepare
to Go to Manila.
Officers of thÂ© Vessel Delighted
"With the Duty of Con
veying Troops.
When She Left Hongkong Prepara
tions for War Wern Being Made
by the United State* Fleot.
The Pacific Mall Steamship Company's
steamer the City of Peking, which is
to be used as a transport ship to con
vey troops and supplies to Admiral
Dewey In the Philippines, reached port
last evening and anchored off Angel
Island. She was boarded by Deputy Sur
veyor of the Port Chauncey St. John,
who extended the courtesies of the port
to the vessel, and did everything In his
power to expedite the clearing of the
ship so that she might be docked as
early as possible. Quarantine Officer
Rosenau, acting under instructions from
Washington, was more lenient than usual
in his examination, and as soon as the
steerage passengers were landed on the
island, the Peking was allowed to dock,
which she reached about 9:30.
The first news of the war was received
by the passengers when the pilot board
! Ed the vessel, but when she left Hong
kong it was expected that fighting would
begin at any time. Shortly before her
departure from there, the authorities at
Washington were cabled that in the event
of war vessels would be needed by the
squadron, and the reauest was made
that the Peking be held at that port.
The reply was that the Peking might
be of more service in the United States
than Hongkong, and that if vessels were
needed by the squadron there were some
already there which could be bought.
Acting on these instructions two Brit
ish ships were purchased. One is a coal
ship loaded with 3500 tons, and was an
chored just astern of the squadron. The
ether is to be used as a storeshtp, and
into it were placed a number of extra
s-pars and boats. When the Peking sailed
Dewey was making preparation* for
war. All the vessels had on their fight
ing paint, the decks had been cleared to
a certain extent, and orders to move
were expected any moment.
The fact that the Government intimated I
that the Peking would be of use here
was enough of a hint to the officers that
she might be used in some capacity, but
Captain Smith knew nothing of the use
to which she would be put until he
reached here. He received notification !
i from the company that the vessel had ]
i been chartered by the Government, and |
I while he claimed that he did not know
whether he was to gr> with the vessel, it i
is generally believed by the officers j
aboard her that the majority of them will i
be reined, and all are anxious to go i
with the troops. Captain Smith says that !
his vessel will be in shape to leave for '
the Philippines by Saturday, if not sooner.
The freight will all be out by Wednes- j
day at the latest, and then, after going i
into drydock for twenty-four hours to be !
relieved of some of her foulness, she will j
be in condition to enter the Government
service.
W. O. Barker, the freight clerk of the
Peking, when asked to make an estimate
on the number of troops and amount of !
freight the vessel could carry, said: "The j
Peking is licensed to carry SOO steerage '
passengers, and can accommodate 100
cabin at present. If fitted up as a troop !
ship she ought easily to accommodate 3000 :
men am] carry 2500 tons of freight be- i
sides." It is rumored that the Peking will i
leave on Saturday under convoy of the ;
Charleston, and this rumor is believed by :
the officers of the vessel.
The steamship was a day overdue when !
she arrived last night, arid the cause of
the delay was heavy head winds en
countered. There were no severe jfales,
but the wind was dead against the ship |
all the way over. Officers on board say
that never before in their experience have
they known of a voyage in which the wind
was dead ahead throughout a trip. The
passenger lint this trip was the largest
the Peking has ever had, there being
seventy-four cabin and 500 steerage pas
sengers. Two hundred of the latter were
left at Honolulu.
Amonjr the cabin passenferss were two
captains and nine lieutenants of the Ja
panese navy. They are here to tako back
two cruisers, which are being built in 'his
country. One of them is the Chitoso,
DONS THE GLORY OF GOLD BRAID.
Detective Seymour Promoted by the Commis
sioners to a Police Captaincy.
The Police Commissioners last night promoted Detective John Seymour to
the position of captain of police, caused by the resignation of Captain Robin
son. He will continue to act as detective until July 1, when Captain of Detec
tives Bohen, who has grown old in the service, will be retired on a pension.
Seymour will then assume the duties of the head of the Detective De
partment.
The new captain is one of the most popular men in the department. Always
affable and kind, he has endeared himself to every member of the police force.
He has had a wide experience as a detective, and will, no doubt, prove himself
worthy of the trust reposed in him.
Seymour wav born in New York on March 1, 1553. He was appointed a
member of the police force in 1884, and a few years later ex-Chief Crowley,
realizing his worth, made him corporal. He was assigned to Captain Spillane's
division, and made an enviable record. He was appointed a detective on May
1. 1892. Since then Seymour has made a number of important captures. He
was mainly instrumental in fastening the murder of Blanche Lamont on Theo
dore Durmnt, who has since been executed. Se3 - mour subsequently arrested
Hoff, the brutal murderer of Mrs. Clute Through his detective skill the sus
pected murderer was convicted of the crime, and will be hanged on June 6. The
new captain also figured in the arrest of a number of daring bank robbers, prin
cipal among whom were Becker and Creegan.
GRAND JURY
DISCHARGED
Judge Belcher Says They
Have Failed to Indict
Big Game.
The Jurors Say They Were Just
Getting Ready to File Indict
ments That Would Have
Made Rome Howl.
Judge Belcher yesterday peremp
torily commanded the Grand Jury to
come Into court and be discharged for
"Inefficiency and general inability to
reach affirmative action" on such
public scandals as the Harbor Com
missioners' steal, the School Eoard's
rottenness and other matters of equal
importance.
The following are the citizens who
have been on the Grand Jury since De
cember, whose worth as an indicting
body has been questioned, and whose
services are to be dispensed with.
Some of them are very angry and say
they did not have a fair chance and
that they were about to file indict
ments that would nave made Rome
howl: Albert Geberding, Arthur F.
Price, WMiam J. Bryan, Henry Mayer,
John D. Daly, John Corbett, Arthur
W. Spear, A. H. Menne, Emile Bauer,

Kampe, James H. O'Brien, Thomas R.
Horton, Charles G. Clinch, H. A.
Hedger and R. H. Warfield.
"We were in session and were ex
amining witnesses and just getting to
daylight on the school scandal," said a
juror last night, "when we got the
letter asking us to come into court on
Thursday and be discharged. We quit
business disgusted at once. We have
found more indictments than most any
Grand Jury they ever had, and were
probing deep down into the harbor
scandal and the school question, as
well as into the Pavilion accident and
! which was launched from the Union Iron
Works some time ago, and the otner is
being built in Philadelphia. They expect
to be ready by September, whin they wfil
be taken to Japan by the officers who ar
! rived last night. Rear-Admiral Miller and
1 Lieutenants Rodgers and Andrews of his
' staff were also passengers, who were
! much interested in the news of the naval
j battle at Manila.
Miss Catherine Noack, a tourist,- vho
i was a passenger on the Peking, died of
; heart disease just before the vessel
reached Honolulu, and she was buried at
! that port. She had been ill before she
started on the trip, and had been warned
not to attempt the voyage, but messages
I from relatives in Germany influenced her
j to risk the passage.
But two vessels were sighted by the Fe
king during her voyage. One was the Ga
; lllee which was met on the 3d inst. Tne
i other was a bark, whose name was not
I learned. Captain Smith signaled her ask
' ing if there was war or peace in the
i I'nued States, but received no reply,
i probably because the vessel had no sig
j nal flags.

with it. This was a strange way to do
with us."
Judge Belcher said last night: "I
am willing to continue any jury that
is likely to do anything, but this body
is torn to pieces by internecine wars.
Assistant District Attorney Dunne,
who has the Grand Jury in charge,
told me this morning that there was
not the slightest chance that they
would be able to reach affirmative ac
tion on anything of importance. Fore
man Gerberding corroborated the
statement, as did Secretary Price and
Mr. Truman. Only a few weeks ago
they had resolutions up wherein they
asked to be discharged. So I decided it
was time to get rid of a jury that had
been working so long without being
able to negotiate business on matters
that are of grave importance. I had
intended to get in a new Jury that
might be able to agree, but if these
people can agree on things of vital in
terest they can go ahead. By the way,
why did they quit last night? If they
are really able to indict or to agree
why do they need more time than un
til Thursday? The - can do a great
deal in the next three days. I acted
for what I thought was best in <he cir-
Some of the jurors, when told what
Judge Belcher said, stated that they
would have been glad had he called
and discussed matters. They agreed
that their foreman served unwillingly
and looked upon the proceedings as a
farce.

ADMIRAL MILLER HERE.
Pleased. That the Baltimore
Won Laurels Off Manila.
"From my knowledge of the ship and
the crew I knew that wherever the battle
raged the hottest there the Baltimore
would be in the thick of it," was Rear
Admiral Miller's remark last night, when
he heard of the Spanish defeat in Manila
harbor.
Admiral Miller and his personal staff
arrived from Honolulu on the City of Pe
king last night, and the first report they
received of Dewey's victory was from the
pilot who boarded the steamer off the
Farallones. "When we left Honolulu,"
said he, "we had not the faintest idea
that war had been declared. When the
Baltimore sailed for Hongkong everybody
on her expected to be in a tight before
many moons, but I did not expect to hear
that the tight was all over when I reach
ed here. The cruiser had a splendid crew
and every man on her was eager to strike
a blow for the colors.
"The training ship Mohican sailed for
home on April 29, but as she will come
up under sail the greater part of the
way I do not expect to see her here for
some days to come. My own destination
I do not know, as I have not received my
dispatches. All 1 know is that I was di
rected to come to San Francisco, and here
I am.
"The Hawaiian Islands are in no danger
nor would they have been had they been
a part of the United States."
Two hours after the Mohican left port
considerable excitement was created in
Honolulu, when the Diamond Head look
out reported that she had come to anchor
in Weialae Bay. More excitement was
created two hours later, when it was re
ported that she had pulled or had drifted
so far into the bay that she could no
longer be seen from the signal station.
Fears were at once created that she
might have drifted upon the rocks and
become a loss. Those fears, however,
were allayed when no boats were . put
ashore nor signals given. This was ac
cepted on the Bennington as conclusive
that her machinery had broken down and
she had simply come to anchor until re
pairs were made.
In the afternoon she resumed her voy
age without having any communication
with the shore.

itely expressive action. One finds himself
Crying to fit words to this poetry of act
ing and one gives it i 1i 1 - in despair at
length; despair of imagining sentences
that shall not weigh upon the wings and
drag down this butterfly of art, this in
tangible, tragic, poetic thing that is Pilar-
Morin in pantomime.
Words really are unnecessary. There is
but one accompaniment that could do
anything but spoil it and that is music
Lachaume's overture is the melodied ver
sion of the tragedy of Sui-Nina, the Japa
nese Empress, whom the law doomed to
self-inflicted death when her lord should
die. Fine and trade in an Oriental minor,
characteristic of the shrill, insistent
twang and the deep, rhythmic bass of the
East is Lachaume's music; and it ac
companies the action of the short trag
edy so closely, so fittingly that from ad
miring it at first, one gradually loses con
sciousness of it. It has become part of the
play itself.
Pilar-Morin is lovely: lovely when she
Is coy, but shows her beautiful white
teeth in a smile for the young Prince;
lovely v.i.en she falls in love with her
own bewitching self clothed In the Em
press' finery; lovely when her wonder
fully expressive 'ace shows the horror
of death in it and shuddering relief whan
the brave Sui-Nina comes back to re
sume her identity and pay the penalty
of Empress-ship. It Is marvelously In
teresting to watch Adzume when the
Empress returns. Two deaths instead of
one are being enacted In that quaint old
Japanese chamber; for the musmee has
contemplated the death the Empress
now Inflicts upon herself. Every fear,
every pang, every anticipated agony la
reflected in her beautiful face, and when
ai the culminating moment the .'Empress
stabs herself, the little dancing girl who
so nearly met death in her stead, lifts
the hem of the satin robe and touches
it to her lips. There is art in that ges-
And therb Is art In the whole produo
tion. It is strong in details. Mile. Ser
erine is a tragic actress of no small abil
ity. Edmond Morin makes the part of
the young Prince very pathetic, very
true and touching with the simples sin
cerity of his acting. There is not a jar
ring note in the whole dumb miniatureâ
for that is what it seems to one; a
classically quaint drama enacted in a
charming setting behind glass, which
prevents one's hearing what is said and
also diminishes the figures and the emo
tions â though the passions, the fear of
death is life-size, thanks to the art of
these clever. Frenchwomen.
Scheel's orchestra precedes the panto
mime in a short programme. It appealed
irresistibly to the feet of the audience
with the Strauss waltz, and it captured
their hearts with the "Star-spangled
Banner" interpolated into Saint-Saens'
Henry VIII. The whole house rose to the
entrance of the clans, translated Into
Yankee melody. Pietro Marino played
Wieniawski's "Polonaise" delicateiy and
gracefully. When to this Marino shall
add the qualities of force and fire he'll
play that beautiful polonaise as Its au
thor might have done.
Biit it Isn't the memory of the muslo
that lingers with you when the Baldwin*
empty. It's the expression on Pilar-
Morin's face; it's the gentle love or the
awful fear in her eyes; it's the light or
the immobile horror in her features; lt'Â»
the grace of her quaint dance or the col
lapse of the little figure as it lies in a
gayly dressed, tragic heap upon the floor.

The Passion Play.
"The Passion Play" continues to attract
splendid attendance at the Baldwin Thea
ter e^ery afternoon. The reproduction of the
play exactly as it is given at Oberammer
gau every ten years proves immensely
interesting, as it is placed before the audi
tor in a most inviting manner. The ac
companying music and lectures are cap
itally rendered and add attractiveness
to the various scenes of the play, as they
i are thrown upon the immense screen.
Every point of the performance, as it is
given by the peasants in the mountains
of Horwitz. is vividly presented and the
action is rapid and continuous. The pic
tures which seem to arouse most enthu
siasm are those representing "The Flight
to Egypt." 'The Last Supper." "The "Way
of the Cross." "The Crucifixion" and
"The Resurrection." although not one of
the thirty odd fails to find favor. "The
Passion Play" will be continued daily at
the Baldwin! except Saturday, at 3 o'clock,
and in order to allow many who are un
able to attend the matinees an opportu
nity of seeing the play, arrangements .axe
being completed for the presentation of
the work on some evening in the near fu
ture.
At the Grand.
Frank London, in his own romantlo
drama, "Prisoners of Algiers," drew a
large attendance to the Grand Opera
house last night. Between the second and
third acts James J. Jeffries, introduced
as "the champion of England, Australia
and California," boxed three lively rounds
with his brother Jack. It was a give-and
take affair from the call of time, and de
lighted the hearts of the gallery gods.
"The Prisoners of Algiers" is a sequel
to "Monte Cristo," in a prologue and
four acts, and deals principally with the
fortunes of Captain Albert, son of Ed
mund Dantes, Count of Monte Cristo.
The oast was a strong one, and several
recalls were insisted upon during the
course of the play. Frank Lindon. as
Edmond Dantes in the prologue and Cap
tain Albert in the drama, carried off the
honors in company with George M. Hayes
as Colonel Danglars. The comedy part of
the play was well taken care of by Mau
rice Stewart as Corporal McKenna; and
as Eugenic Danglars Miss Maud Edna
Hall received a warm welcome back to
the Grand Opera-house. A cordial word
of praise Is due Landers Stevens for his
well-studied presentation of Benedetto
and Leslie Morosco fnr his handling of
the character of Maxamilian Morell.
"Prisoners of Algiers" should crowd the
Grand Opera-house throughout the week.
Alcazar.
Miss Gertrude Foster won the approval
of a large and critical gathering of first
nighters at the Alcazar last evening by
her graceful and clever rendering of
"Niobe." She instilled life and animation
Into this difficult part, retaining through
out a natural grace of manner that
charmed every one.
The return of the favorites Wright
Huntington and Miss Kingsley from their
southern tour resulted in their receiYln*
an ovation and a large assortment of
flowers, which were showered on them by
a host of admirers. Huntingtons natural
acting as Corney helped to add fuel to
the fire of humor that pervades the com
edy. Miss Kjngsley did good work as
Hattie Stockwell was in his element as
Petravus and kept the audience in a hys
terical condition by his excellent comedy
work Mrs. Bates, as the strong-minded
but interfering sister, caused shivers to
wn down the backs of the audience. She
was at her best and made things lively
for those who came in contact with her
rtiirine- the Play. The other members of
the gave strong -support, and if
last nielit's crowd is a criterion of the
popularity of the comedy the theater will
be packed nightly^
