A Mob's Awful VengeanGe
Upon the Slayers of
a Woman.
Indians Taken From Their Home
to Expiate in a Most Hor=
rible Manner a Most
Horrible Crime.
.LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Jan. B.â A spe
cial to the Gazette from Port Smith,
says: Justice in a more horrible form
than that meted out to Harry Smith at
I'aris, Tex., was administered by a
mob on the Oklahoma border on Fri
day night to J. Marcus McGeisy and
Palmer Simpson, two Seminole Indians.
They were charged with murder, their
victim being; Mrs. James Simmons, a
respectable farmers wife living in Ok
lahoma.
The crime was a most revolting one
and the criminals were punished in a
most revolting manner. Mrs. Simmons
.was assaulted and murdered. The
body was horribly mutilated. The
crime resembled in atrocity those
-petrated in the Creek Nation by the
infamous Buck gang, the members of
which were hanged at Fort Smith two
yean ago. The murder and mutilation
â¢ Mrs. Simmons so enraged the neigh
borhood that nearly the entire populace
turned out to hunt down and punish
the guilty parties. The trail led the
to the home of McGeisy, near
Maud, a small town in the Seminole
Nation, where McGeisy and Simpson
were arrested.
After securing their prisoners the
tob Bet fire to McGeisy' s house and
barn and dM not leave until they saw

â¢.; The prisoners were then carried back
â¢ r. ss the line into Oklahoma Terri
tory, arid near the scene of their crime
they were excuted by Judge Lymh's
, drder in the most horrible manner that
human minds and human hands could
devise. They were burned at the stake.
Thp Indians met their doom with the
â  usual ptoicism of their rare. After life
was extinct the mob allowed the fires
â  die down, and they then quietly dis- ;
persed to their several homes.
No secret was made of the fact that '
the Indians had been burned to death,
and this morning their charred bodies.
burned beyond recognition, were found
lying in the ashes of their funeral pyre.
Everybody in the vicinity seems to
know that the Indians were executed
for the murder of Mrs. Simmons, but
everybody appears to be entirely igno
rant of the individuals who composed
the mob.
Information was received here of the
terrible affair from persons who saw
the charred bodies of the Indians.
Great uneasiness exists along the Ok
lahoma border, and the impression pre
vails that much more bloodshed will
follow the work of the mob.
This is the third instance of mob vio- J
lence reported in the Indian Territory !

RAILROADS SWINDLED
BY A CONTORTIONIST.
Trick of a Clever Athlete in Dislocating a
Hip in Falling Upon the Platform
of a Car.
INDIANAPOLIS, Jan. S.â Railroad
officials here are blue over news re
ceived from Virginia. Two months ago
a man fell on the platform of a train
about five miles out of this city. Hi;,
heel caught in the crack and his hip
was dislocated by the fall. Three sur
geons examined him, including the
company's surgeon, and all declared
that the man would be a cripple for
life. The man was paid $2200 and his
lawyer's fees. In addition to this he
was furnished with a baggage car and
transportation for his lawyer and
nurse to go with him to Chicago. The
railroad officials felt they had made a
cheap settlement. The other day a
man fell on the platform of the Nor
folk and Western in Virginia and
worked the same old story of a dislo
cated hip. But he had been seen on
the previous day hunting for a place
to catch his heel. A traveling man
was present and recognized him as the
man who had been paid by the Indian
apolis road. An investigation re
vealed that the roan was a professional
contortionist, and could dislocate any
part of his body without pain. He has
swindled several roads.

the courthouse window at 1 o'clock this
morning "Blackie," alias Chadwick
Marshall, the self-confessed murderer
of Orville Hayden. It was a quietly
executed crime, but, nevertheless, a
bloody one. The mob had no difficulty
in obtaining entrance to the jail and to
the cell where "Blackie" lay sleeping:.
As he sprang, startled and but half
awake, from his couch he cried:
"Don't hurt me. Before God and
man I am innocent." Then he sank to
the floor, unconscious from a blow on
the temple from a heavy revolver.
The rope was placed about his neck
and he was half dragged, nalf carried
to the courtroom of Juri^e McDonald,
on the floor above. There the end of
the rope was made fast to the narrow
beam that separates the two windows,
and the unconscious, bleeding and al
most naked body was hurled out. The
feet touched the top of the windows on
the floor below, but never moved. The
man slowly strangled t> death. His
only attire was an under and an over
shirt.
At 3 o'clock this morning the body
was cut down and turned over to the
Coroner, who held an Inquest. The
verdict of the jury was thai Marshall
came to his death by hanaine at the
hands of a mob. the members of which
are unknown. The body lies at an un
dertaker's, where it has been viewed
by thousands to-day.
Robert Mi Donald, alms "Dakota
.siim," the partner <Â»f "Blackie," \\;is
more fortunate than his mate, and
MVed his life n<>t through any efforts
of the Sheriff's officers, but through his
own courage and ingenuity. When the
nn ill had handed "Blackie" it returned
to UM jail and entered the corridor
where "Slim" was confined. Th^y
found the look to the outer door of his
cell stuffed with paper and wood,
placed there through the bars by
â¢"Slim" himself while they were at
their work upstairs. As they tried to
pry out the mass "Slim" appealed at

bullet, spattering against the wall, had
struch him in the breast, inflicting
only a scratch, and another portion
had pnsÂ«d throueh his sleeve. He was
practically uninjured, but feigned
death and deceived the mob, who
glanced at him hurriedly and fled.

MYSTERY OF THE
MISSING MINER
NOW CLEARED
Letters Received From John W.
Home, Reported to Have Been
Murdered and Robbed of
a Large Sum.
TACOMA, Jan. 8. â The police forces
of several cities, including San Fran
cisco, Spokane, Seattle and Tacoma,
have of late been in a state of much
uncertainty and disturbance concern
ing the mysterious disappearance of
John W. Home, an Alaskan miner,
whom they credit with having dropped
out of sight having in his possession
n snug little fortune amounting to $25,
000. His disappearance is detailed in
a notice sent out by Chief Lees of the
San Francisco Police Department. Sev
eral northwestern papers have printed
long and exciting stories, going to show
that despite the efforts of the best de
tectives on the coast Home could not
be traced from the day last September
when he left San Francisco by steamer
for Tacoma.
It came to liyrht that Home is alive
and â well and has been quietly attend
ing to rjis business in entire ignorance
of the commotion his supposed disap
pearance was causing, or of the fact
that some believed He had been mur
dered for his money. On his return
from Alaska last summer Home vis
ited his brother, H. G. Home, a car
penter here, and later made a flying
trip to San Francisco, depositing part
of his money here and part there.
While Home was in Alaska his
mother, who resided in Racine, Wis.,
died, and H< me during his stay in San
Francisco concluded to ro to his
mother's home and settle up her es

tate. He accordingly came back to
Tacoma, prevailed upon his brother
here to accompany him East, and the
two left for Racine. No secret was
made of their movements, and when
The Call correspondent to-day inves
tigated the facts he learned that sev
eral persons knew all about the
brothers' trip East and that Home's
carpenter-shop and tools are being
cared for by a friend here until
Home's return. Both brothers are
daily expected to return here, and
since their departure have written to
several friends telling of their trip
and experiences in Wisconsin. Home's
latest letter to a friend here, written
about two weeks ago from Racine,
announced that he would reach Ta
coma within two weeks from the date
of writing. His friends expect him
daily to arrive and personally disprove
the murder and .robbery theory ar
rived at by the San Francisco and Ta
coma detectives.
The local police force does not seem
to have given Chief Lees' inquiries the
attention they deserve, for a look in
the directory and a consultation with
friends of the brothers residing here
would have cleared up the mystery.
The Golden Gate detectives apparently
believed that a thorough search had
been made here and consequently con
cluded that Home never reached Ta
coma.
Home had friends in San Francisco
who knew of his good fortune and that
he had taken considerable money to
San Francisco with him. When he left
town quietly they thought he had dts
appeared and requested Chief Lees to
set detectives at work. In October
Home's relatives in lowa wrote here
for information concerning him and
the search was nominally renewed.
This week came another letter from
his nephew, George W. Scott of Eldon,
lowa, suggesting that he might have
returned to Dawson. The police were
preparing to act on this theory when
informed to-day that Home was dvÂ«
here himself. It is understood he will
return to the Klondike early in the
spring.
BOATS FOR THE YUKON.
Contracts for Two Vessels to Ply Between
St. Michael and Dawson.
PORTLAND, Ore., Jan. B.â A con
tract for building two sternwheel
steamboats for use upon the Yukon
River has just been completed between
the Willamette lion Works and John
A. Magee, Jr., of San Francisco. The
contract price is between $80,000 and
$!)0,000, and includes the complete con
struction and equipment of the two
b:ats. Mr. Magee is working in con
junction with a San Francisco compa
ny, who wilt put on two ships between
the latter city and St. Michael. From
St. Michael the two steamboats, to be
built here, will run to Dawson City,
and, with four barges, handle freight
and passengers Avhich will be delivered
by the steamship company.
James Tartan of the Willamette Iron
Works returned from San Francisco
to-day, and in speaking about the mat
ter said: "We will proceed at once
with the construction of these two
boats, and will have them ieady to be
towed north by May 15. They are
each to be 175 feet in length, with 36

COLORADO GIRLS
IN GREAT DEMAND
Remarkable Order of Manager-
Bailey of the Hotel
Coi'onado.
After n Bevy of Beautiful Waitresses
to Make Hi* HÂ«'sort the Talk
of All Tourists.
Sprrln* I>li=r>.itch to The Pall.
DENVER, Jan. R.â Colorado is all
agog over the fact that there is a run
on waiter girls from this State, It all
comes from an order placed by Man
acer Bailey of the Hotel Coronado,
who demanded the services of girls
who were accustomed to the hotel nf
of Colorado. He prescribed their
height, wt'ipht and ages, adding that
he would not hire any one with short
hair â not that be was opposed to suf
frage and women's rightsâ but he
wanted a bouquet of beauty that
w.uild make his hotel the talk of all
tourists.
The manager Interdicted all ship
ments exceeding 160 pounds of plump
femininity and also placed a bu upon
the small apron wearers. Their hair
must hang down theia backs, accord
ing to th" veracious employment
agent who received th.- order, and not
be less than waist length.
This order Is all the more remark
able owing to the fact that Manager
LJailey is not a native of this State.
He came here to open the Hotel fJlen-
WOOd and Imported his own waitresses
from Boston. There were fifty alto
gether, but they could not stand the
climate or something, BO he g"t rid of
them and engaged a lot of the best
lookers among in* native born girls of
the Suffrage State. That he wan sat
isfied with his experience goes without
saying now that he is anxious to add
to the export list of Colorado the
blooming young suffragists who have
been raised to have their own way and
make the men obey;
SHE IS TO
WED AGAIN,
RUMOR SAYS
Continued from Flrit Pace.
For my part I do not consider, that an
engagement exists, even though vows
have been exchanged, until a formal
announcement has been made. A
public declaration to dm alone consti
tutes an engagement."
Mrs. Denman whs not loth to admit
that she had heard the Interesting ru
mors, and that her friends had even
this early offered their congratulations.
Humor not only connects the names of
the worthy young couple, but goes on
to state that the formal announce
ment of these two. hearts that beat as
one is to be made public in a month.
Mrs. Hlnckley,- the heiress of the
many Blythe millions, is known
and highly esteemed in this commu
nity. The litigation for the vast
wealth of her father has now virtually
ceased and Mrs. Hinckley's attorneys
declare that the case is now closed in
her favor. JSKSSSmBM

JTOUng man. Is manager for the well
known law firm of ChickrrinÃ. Thomas

known educator and ex-Supervisor
James Denman. In appearnme he is
tall, stately, handsome and dignified,
and is a remarkably stylish dresser.
Be is well known in club and social
circles and Is a great favorite with his
many friends.
Mrs. Florence Blythe-Hinckley was
seen in Oakland last night with refer
ence to the rumors. The iÂ»'tite and
charming little heiress was not at all
surprised over the call, as she had
been notified early in the evening by
Mr. Denman and members of his fam-
I'.y that newspaper men were on their
trail.
"No. I must deny the rumor. It is
not true â nor was the one that pr.-i â¢â <!
ed It to the effect that I was engaged
to Mr. Moore. Yes, I know Mr. Den
man; he Is a friend. I will let you
know when anything is going to hap
pen."
In spite of all these denials, how,
ev.>r. the stmy is siill making the
rounds of the gossips, and many who
claim an Intimacy with the young
oouple insist that It had b*Â«n agreed
between Mr. Penman and Mrs. Hinck

BEATS A FRIEND
AND RUNS AWAY
How Henry Marvin Re
quited Favors Show
ered Upon Him.
Given Bed and Board by E.
A. Brown, a Resident of
Hollister.
He Takes His Benefactor's Kevolver
ini.t All but Manages to
Kill Him.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAX JOSE, Jan. B.â Robbery and al
most murder were committed this morn
ing by Henry Marvin, a broken-down
Kambler, upon a friend and benefactor,
E. A. Brown, a farmer from Hollister,
in a lodging house on North Market
street. Brown met Marvin in Hollister
i week ago, and as the latter was broke
Brown provided him with work and
food. Brown had decided to leave Hol
lister and come to thlÃ county to en
gage in the hog business. As Marvin
\\iis doing nothing he was brought
along. The men left Hollister a couple
of days ago by team and arrived here
last night On the road they picked up
K. If. Owena and wife, actors who had
become stranded at Santa Cruz, and
brought them to this city. Brown put
up Ma lam in a stable and secured a
room for Owens and his wife and also
one for Marvin and himself at the lodg
ing house. Brown and Marvin spent
the evening looking about town and re
tlred about :â¢ o'clock. Brown placed his
in. us. is containing $360 under his pil
low. He was awakened this morning
by Marvin beating him over the head
with a revolver, and taking his trous
ers out from under his head. He was
terribly beaten about the face and head
and rendered unconscious. His cries
attracted Owens, who rushed into the
ball in time to Me Marvin leaving the
room and running down stairs. He
raised a window and asked people on
the street to stop Marvin as he had
killed a man, but no attention was paid
to his cries, and the man escaped.
Brown, who was covered with blood,
was removed to the Receiving Hospital
and his wounds dressed. They are not
s. -rious and he will be all right in a day
or two. The revolver used by Marvin
was found in the room. He had risÂ»n
early and gone to the stable and got
the revolver from Brown's wagon.
< Â»n the way up from Hollister Marvin
became infatuated with Mrs. Owens
and proposed that ahe elope with him.
He told her he had a great deal of
wealth and offered to give her a check
for $1000 in the morning if she would
consent to run away with him.
Marvin has not been arrested and the
officers throughout the county have
been notilled to be on the lookout Xor
him.
HANGED BY
A MOB AT
MIDNIGHT
Continued from First Pag*.
ing to his friends in the country sur
rounding. Sheriff Sims was in Spo
kane when the mob entered the Jail.
He was toM last night that an at
tempt would purely be r~-\de to lynch
"Blackfo" and "Slim," but he laughed
at his informant and left for Spokane.
Judge McDonald, who has protested
against the imputation that the good
people of Colfax would allow a lynch
ing, is much wrought up. He has or
dered a searching; investigation to be
made and in the meantime has sent
"Slim" for safe keeping to Walla
Walla.
Bo quietly was the lynching con
ducted that the night watchman in
town did not know until 6 o'clock that
it had taken place. Bailiff C. B. Scott,
who sleeps in a room adjoining the
' -urtroom, from which the body was
flung, was not awakened. Deputy
Bhaiiff H. R Treff is the Jailer in
charge of the Jail at nights and sleeps
there. His assistant, William Canto
wine, remains on watch inside the Jail.
Lml ni^ht as the mob approached
BMm" saw the masked figures pass
th<- window. He called to Cantowine
to lire out of the window. Cantowine
did not do so and he says he was so
excited that he doos not know whether
or not "Slim" spoke to him.
The mob quietly entered the build
ing and awakened Treff. They told
him they had some prisoners to put
In. He got up without awakening his
wife and went out to face a score of
revolver muzzles. He was taken up
stairs tn the Sheriff's office, where he
unlocked the safe and took out the
keys. Then he went with the mob
and entered the main corridor. Canto
wine, from Inside the corridor guarding
the inside door, held his revolver in his
hand and asked what was wanted.
(â¢pen the dÂ«Â»or," commanded the
leader of the mob. Cantowine looked
questioningly at his chief, who was
placed in the front of the mob.
"Yes. open the door," said Treff.
Cantowine did so and the mob en
tered.
"Blackle" was asleep in his cell on an
upper gallery and was not awakened
until the men entered the cell. The pris
oners heard his ejaculation and the
blow that felled him.
The mob returned trembling and
fearful. It was then that "Slim" made
his stand. Had he been overpowered
the chances are that Symes and Leon
ard, the two other murderers confined
in the Jail, would have gone also, but
the mob had already cowed itself and
'Sllm's' flght had destroyed Its last
scrap of bravery.
The murder of Orville Hayflen was
committed' on the outskirts of Farm
ington on the morning of October 23.
Farmlngton is a . cold-water town ly
ing close to the Idaho line. Just over
the line is a saloon. Several men left
this saloon late on the evening of the
22d for Farmington. They were held
up by two men. relieved of their money
and made to hide In a fence corner.
Finally, Hayden with two companions
came along. They, too. were held up.
Hayden was slow in getting his hands
up and ; was fired on. Two shots were
fired through his breast. He turned
and ran across the linÂ«, â¢ falling dead
near the saloon. He .was intÂ«uaÂ«ly pop
ular and great indignation was
aroused.
Several weeks later two men were
arrested, one at Rosalia and the other
at Oakesdale. They were with a party
of tramps. One pave the name of "Da
kota Slim," the other was called
"Blackie." A sort of confession was
extorted from "Blackie" by a detec
tive. The evidence against him was
wtrong. Neither he nor "Slim" has
had a preliminary examination, infor
mations being filed direct in the Su
perior Court. Marshall's true name
w-as Charles, although he was known
as Chadwlck" Marshall. He was the
son of the late Judge T. J. Marshall of
Mexico, Mo., a prominent man of that
State. "Blackle's" brother, Thomas H.,
is a banker in Mexico.
HANFORD SCHOOL CHILDREN FEASTED.
Mrs. E. J. Raw! ins Gives Them a Christmas
Tree and Dinner.
HANFORD, Jan. B.â Mrs. J. E. Raw
lins entertained all of Hanford'a school
children this afternoon with a Christ
mas tree and dinner. Preparations had
been in progress all the week at the
commodious opera house, arranging the
big tree and decorating for the occa
sion. This afternoon at 3:30 o'clock the
doors were thrown open and the con
gregation of little ones, about 500 in'
number, marched into the hall, where
the tree, with its weight of pretty and
useful presents, and covered with myr
iads of tiny incandescent electric lights
made the scene a veritable fairyland
A number of presents were given to
each child, and after the distribution
the little guests repaired to the balco
ny, where a feast had been spread.
While the children were enjoying the
big dinner Mrs. Rawlins entertained the
oider guests on the stage serving a
luncheon.
BLOWN UP IN
THE OHIO RIVER
Towboat Percy Kelsey Torn to
Pieces by an Ex
plosion.
Bodies or the Killed and Wounded
Hurled Among the Floating
Wreckage.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PITTSBURG, Jan. B.â The towboat
Percy Kelsey. owned by K. H. Brown
& Sons of this city, blew up while go
ing down the Ohio River, near Glen
field, Pa., about 11 o'clock this morn
ing, and six or eight of the crew were
killed and at least four of the others
injured.
The boat was commanded by Captain
Leslie Jones of Shousetown, Pa., and
the crew was made up of two pilots,
two engineers, two mates, two firemen,
a chambermaid, cook and deck hands â
in all about eleven persons.
The Kelsey left Pittsburg about 8
o'clock this morning with a tow con
sisting of seven barges and two flats
of coal, and everything was apparently
all right until the explosion took place,
when the boat was literally blown to
pieces and the tow scattered and lost.
The hull sank almost immediately, and
the shattered fragments of the upper
works floated down the river and cov
ered the water with wreckage.
The explosion w;is most terrific, and
was heard for miles. Hundreds of per
sons ran to the river upon hearing the
noise, and an awful sight met their
gaze. Bodies were floating down the
stream, and the debris was scattered
far and wide, but no living person was
eeen. A few minutes later Captain
Jones and three others were picked up
alive, but badly injured, and one body
floated ashore near Neville Island.
The injured were removed to Cap
tain Crow's residence on Neville Island,
where everything possible was done to
alleviate their sufferings. It Is believed
that the rest of the crew were killed,
and parties are now searching for their
bodies.
When the boat blew up Pilot Woods
was asleep in the pilot house only a
few feet from Captain Jones. Others
of the crew were also asleep. The pilot
was thrown high in the air and fell
right where a few minutes before the
pilot house was. He was dead when
found, and a pitiable sight was his
son. lying only a few feet away and
injured very badly. He was pleading
to help his father.
Captain Leslie Jones was injured by
a bad cut on the head and his back
is badly sprained. The body of Fire
man Webster was blown ashore near
by. Only three of the crew escaped un
injured.
MORE LITIGATION AHEAD
FOR THE FAIR ESTATE.
Two Farmers of Indiana Who Claim to Be
Relatives of the Late United States
Senator.
LOGANSPORT. Ind., Jan. B.â ln this
county there resides two farmers who
claim to be relatives of the late United
States Senator Fair of California, and
they are preparing to bring suit for
part of the estate left by him.
The accounts of the recent suit for
the possession of the estate by a wom
an who claimed to be Senator Fair's
wife were read by James Parker and
Hezekiah Fair in the metropolitan dai
lies. They began to talk it over, and
finally figured out a relationship.
Their grandfather. Wiliam E. Fair,
was born In Mercer County. Pa., and
removed at an early day to Hamilton
<. ounty, Ohio, and afterward moved
here. He was the father of William
Andrew, Hezekiah. James G. and San
ford. The son named San ford went
West and was never heard from again
Hezekiah fair, residing here, asserts
that he has heard his father, now dead
speak of his brother Sanford and won
der what became of him.
It is supposed Sanford Fair married
while in California, he having left dur
ing the gold fever, and that a child was
born to him, which he named after his
brother, James G.. and who afterward
became United States Senator.
The father of Parker and Hezekiah
was named William. Their claim to
relationship has excited the interest of
rruny people near here and a leading
lawyer is now taking steps to bring suit
in San Francisco for a share of the
vast estate.

DEBATING THE
CIVIL SERVICE
Continued Opposition to
the Law as It Now
Stands.
Members of the House Favor
Some Important Modi
fications.
Hepburn Speaks Against the Popular
Impression of the So-Called
Merit System.
Bpecial Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington. Jan. 8.
The House devoted two hours of the
session to-day to the civil service de
bate, during which Corliss (R.) of
Michigan, Hepburn (R.) of lowa and
Clark (R.) of New Hampshire ad
dressed the House in opposition to the
law as it now stands. ' The remainder
of the session was conÂ»umea by tnÂ«
friends of the late Representative
Wright of Massachusetts In eulogies of
his memory.
Corliss (R.) of Michigan was the first
speaker to-day. He favored radical
modifications of the civil service law.
He thought that, constitutionally the
heads of the departments were clothed
with the powef of appointing their sub
ordinates. To that extent he thought
the law, if tested, would be unconstitu
tional. He believed the right of remov
al should be restored and the tenure of
office limited.
Hepburn (R.) of lowa spoke for an
hour against what he termed the popu
lar impression of the so-called merit
system. The public, he argued, had
been entirely misled by the high-sound
ing titles referred to. He believed the
appointive power and the power of re
moval should be lodged in the same
hands, and should be unlimited. Amid
a burst of applause from the galleries
and the floor he insisted that the polit
ical workers were entitled to and
should be accorded recognition. If there
were to be no reward for the workers,
the workers in the future would be
more and more loyal to rich contribut
ors instead of to their party or their
country. If the present system con
tinued the influence of rich men in pol
itics would grow steadily. Hepburn
said he knew his frank expressions
would earn criticism for him. and it
would probably be said that he placed
himself on a low political plane, but
these were his convictions, and he
would utter them.
Clarke <R.) of New Hampshire closed
the debate with some remarks in favor
of modifying the law. He did not care
to specify the modifications he would
make. He was willing to leave that to
the judgment of the Civil Service Com
mittee. But "any old thing" was bet
ter than the present law. (Laughter.)
After 2 o'clock the time was devoted
to tributes to the life and public ser
vices of the late Representative Wright
of Massachusetts. Those who paid
tribute to the deceased colleague were

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON. Jan. B.â The disclosure of
the details and terms of the acquisi
tion of Kiaochau Bay by Germany
momentarily scared the British public,
which, however, now regards Germa
ny's move with all the more equanim
ity, as, in the opinion of persons inti
mately acquainted with China. Kiao
chau Bay is of little commercial value,
and will only be a source of huge ex
pense for the Germans. If the harbor
. had been commercially valuable, it is
pointed out, it would long ago have
T>een a treaty port, but it is said to be
'"â¢ completely overshadowed by the close
proximity of flourishing Chefu. The
province of Shantung, it is added, is
entirely agricultural and hardly able to
' support its population, while the
Btrategic value of Kiaochau Bay r?.r
be inferred by the fact of Russia, in
epite of the Cassinl treaty, allowing
Germany to occupy it. Altogether,
Kiaochau Bay is not likely to prove
a bed of roses.
The British Government maintains a
pphinx-like reserve regarding Chinese
affairs, and there are no further reve
lations of its intentions since the state
ment made by the Manchester Guar
dian on January 3, which was unques
tlonably the official view of the situa
tion.
A conclusive illustration of the atti
tude of the British Government is fur
nished by the presence of warships of
Great Britain at Chemulpo and Port
Arthur, and it is likely to be further
â  demonstrated by the sending of ships
Kiaochau Bay. In well-informed
>â¢â¢". circles it is asserted that it is not like
' .ly Great Britain will formally protest
.. pjrninst the lease of Kiaochao Bay to
' ; : Germa'ny, but will confine hÂ«rs a lf to the '
â  : ?-. significant hint given in the mcv&ments '

,;;-rnust be strangely unobservant if they
â -..imagine that either Great Britain, the
-..â â X'nited States or Japan will allow them
'.i-.-the monopoly of th' j plum?."
/ The Spectator revels in the statement
.that the United States is inclined to
â  support the British demand that no ex
" â '. -elusive privileges be granted to any in
. : dividual power in China, and says:
"X>. thing short of a direct menace of
aggression would tempt any combina
.;','-tion of continental powers to face the
':' whole Anglo-Saxon race, united and
"".-! resolved."
It is amusing to notice Russia and
France courting Japan. Both of them
are in deadly fear of h--r forming an
offensive and defensive alliance with
Great Britain. As a matter of fact.
there are things much more unlikely
than the eventual aliian<-e of Great
. Britain. China and Japan, and the cc-n
tingency would acquire still more prob
ability should Great Britain, as it now
seems certain, guarantee a Chinese
lean. At thf present moment, so far as
Great Britain Is concerned, the loan is
the kernel of the whole question.
THE MAINE FOR CHINA.
A Vessel fs Wanted to Take the Place of
the Flagship Olympia.
. NBLW YORK, Jan. B.â A "Washington
special to the Herald says: The gun

upon reaching her destination will at
a Qnce be assigned to duty at such point
along the Chinese coast where Ameri
can Interests are located as Commodore
â  Dewey, commander in chief of the Asi
atic station, may consider desirable.
Officials of the Navy Department are
looking about for some ship to take the
place- of the Olympia, the flagship of
the Asiatic station. The Olympia's boil
ers require retubing. There is no vessel
on the Pacific station that can be as
pigned to duty in Chinese waters at
present! The Baltimore is at Honolulu.
It has been reported that the battleship
Oregon is to go to China, but this is
untrue.
Repairs to the cruiser Charleston
-will be completed in the spring and
she may go to China, but she is not
suitable for a flagship.
The present indications point to the
Maine, which is on duty at the North
Atlantic station, as the only suitable
Vessel available to relieve the Olympic.
â¢â  Administration officials and diplo
mats are watching developments in the
: Kast with the keenest interest. France

â <Â»ne of Germany's demands was
that she. should be given the concession

reaches out for the entire pim-ince. I
would far rather see England in pos
session of Kiaochau. for with England's

SHIPPED ON ICE
WHILE YET ALIVE.
There Would Seem to Be Some
thing Pretty Close to Mur
der in This Most Re
markable Case.
NEW YORK, Jan. B.â A Special to the Herald from Shamokln, Pa..
says: After lying in the dead house of a hospital for two hours
and then being shipped in an ice box twenty miles, Lucas Hamiak was
found still alive. He died shortly after his body had reached home.
Hamiak was injured in the Excelsior mine on last Tuesday afternoon
by a fall of coal. He was taken to the Miners' Hospital at Fountain
Springs, with his left foot and right arm crushed. It was decided to
amputate the leg below the knee and arm at the shoulder, but the
operations were postponed, as the patient was weak from loss of blood.
Mrs. Hamiak visited her husband in the hospital on last Wednesday
morning, when he seemed rational and talked with her.
Finally she bid him good-by and went to the station to return home.
While she was waiting a message was sent to her that her husband had
died. She waited for the body, which was placed in an ice box and ac
companied it home. Jacob Torinchak removed the lid of the box and
expressed the opinion that Hamiak was alive. There were several per
sons in the room, ami after they had examined the body they asserted
that Hamiak was still breathing. The body was still warm and the ice
had "nearly all melted. While they were consulting what was best to
do Hamiak died. This was about fifteen minutes after the lid was
taken off.
Affidavits embodying the above facts have been made by John
Glowa, postmaster; Zacharias Horosczak and Daniel Fodorchak. all of
whom were present when the box was opened. Dr. Biddle, superintend
ent of the Miners" Hospital, positively asserts that Hamiak was dead
when placed in the ice box. He asserts that the nurses and physicians
examined him carefully after his supposed death and all pronounced
him dead. Hamiak spent three hours in the ice box before It was open
ed and it was found that he was alive.

CEDAR FALLS. la., Jan. B.â Earl
Coleman.the 13 year old son of Presid
ing Elder F. M. Coleman. was kid
naped at 6 o'clock this evening while
standing in front of his father's resi
dence in this city.
Fred Chainphiin. the kidnapsr, start
ed with the boy down Fourth street,
toward the river, when he was m--t by
F. G. Miller, cashier of the First Na
tional Bank, and William Dickson, his
assistant. Karl shouted for help, and
for a moment escaped from Chiim
plain and caught hold of Dickson.
Champlain drew a revolver and drove
the would-be rescuers back, and catch
ing' up v. ith the boy continued his way
down thf street, finally disappearing
in the woods.
Champlain is believed to have sud
denly become violently insane. He had
continually sought the society of the
boy. Recently the father of the child
forbade him seeing Earl except at his
house. Champlain is 28 years old and
was always considered rational.
Searching parties were formed and
the man was finally located under the
floor in the basement of the opera
house. Two men started to crawl under
the floor, but the maniac warned them
hi? would fire. They continued, in spite
of his threats, and he attempted to
fire. The cartridge missed fire five
times. At last he succeeded in dis
charging the revolver, but the shots
went wide of the mark. The pursuers
quickly retreated.
An immense crowd gathered about
the opera-house by this time, and axes
were procured and a hole chopped
through the floor. The maniac was
then promised protection if he would
come out and deliver the boy unin
jured. Champlain accepted the terms
and gave up both himself and the boy.
The maniac was seized by officers and
two revolvers and a razor were taken
from him. A mob attempted to take
the prisoner from the officers, but he
was carefully guarded and landed in
the county jail, which is now surround
ed by deputies.

NEW YORK, Jan. B.â Eugene L. Les
zynski is by no means discouraged by
the result of his preliminary skirmish
with th? Metropolitan Street Railway
Company. Although Judge Lacombe

rected the jury to find a verdict for the

reasonable bounds."
I^eszynski boarded a Broadway cable
car on April 3, 1896. Soon after he had
paid his fare the car came to a stop. lie
kept his Seat for nearly half an hour,
and then he left the car, telling the
conductor that he would board one of
the cars that- he could see were being
switched from a down track to an up
track at Houston street. He walked to
Houston street, got on a car, and re
fused to pay an extra fare. He was
thrown from the car and then arrested
on a charge of disorderly conduct.
â¢1 am fighting this case for principle,
riot for the money involved," remarked
Leszynski, "and I am now satisfied
that the battle is won. If 100 men will
assert their manhood and make a firm
stand whenever occasion arises the
company will soon be forced to issue
transfers in such cases, as it Is bound
to do as the law now stands. In all
other large cities in this country the
companies have been compelled to issue
emergency transfers. Before my case
came to trial I was offered $5000 to dis
continue my action. I positively re
fused to take the money, but I said I
would compromise if the company
would agree to issue transfers, but
these terms, were declined. I called to
day on my lawyers, Hoadly, Lauter

would still consent to stop proceedings
on the same terms. I said: 'No, as I
believe that the fight is won.' "

QUALIFIED FOR THE CRIME
Much Comment as to What Count
Ebterhazy Has Had to Do With
the Notorious Case.
Copyright, IS9B. by James Gordon Bennett.
PARIS, Jan. B.â The publication was
i made yesterday of the report drawn
:up against Captain Dreyfus on the
! occasion of the court-martial of 1894,
a document which friends of the pris
oner on the He dv Diable have all along
been expected to make public, and
j which his enemies have been endeav
oring to discredit in any case. While
the effect of the publication can
\ scarcely bÂ« said to be equal to that of
i a bombshell, it has been in Dreyfus'
favor. It is a weak arraignment. Its
summing up shows its character well.
After referring to the former captain's
i relation with women, married and un
i married, and his frequentalion of
I gambling-houses, which it is to be
noted the prisoner denied, the docu
ment concludes:
"The basis of the accusation brought
against Dreyfus is a double one, con
i sisting of a moral element and a ma
terial one. The first we have exam
ined; the second consists in an incrimi
nating letter, which in *he opinion of
i the majority of the experts, as well as
! that of the witness and ourselves, pre
; sents but for an intentional unresem-
I blance complete simihirity with the
authentic writing of Dreyfus. In ad
dition to what we already stated Drey
fus possesses, as is well known by his
companions, a remarkable memory.
He speaks several languages, notably
German, which he knows thoroughly,
and Italian, which he pretends to
i know only slightly. He is endowed
with a very supple character, and he
has an obsequious manner, which is
well raited to the work of espionage.
Everything therefor* points to Drey
fus as lit i>il for the miserable and
sham- ful mission which he accepted,
and which, happily for France, his
discovery put an et â¢! to."
Th<* authorfth-s ire much exercised
as to how a copy i the â¢I'>Â«uiment has
been obtained by the newspapers, and
we shall probably have another Inquiry
graftid oa the Dreyfus tree. Kather
more attention is paid to a letter ad
dresaed by Senator Trarient, former
Minister of Justice, to the Minister of
War in regard to the case. Senator
Trarient voices the opinion of a large
section of the community when he
argues In favor of making the court
martial, which meets on Monday upon
Commandant Esterhazy. public. Sen
ator Trarient. after pointing out that
all the evidence, except the (amova bor
dereau, against Dreyfus consisted of
more or less vague reports about his
morality, declares that there is still a
reasonable doubt as to whether Drey
fus was really the author of the bor
dereau.
"However," concludes Senator Tra
rient, "it matters not whether th.- Gov
ernment have in their possession irre
futable proofs of the guilt of Dreyfus
or not. The question is whether Drey
fus and his counsel Bar. those proofs
or whether in violation of law he was
condemned without having seen them."
In regard to the forth< omlng court
martial it is asserted that while the
letters alleged to have boon written by
Commandant Esterhazy to Mme. de
Boulamy will be brought forward as
a subsidiary feature, great stress will
be laid on the secret d<> Miment pro
duced at the trial of ex-Captain Drey
fus. In point of fact, although Presi
dent Corneil declared In the parlia
mentary tribune that th>Â»re was an
Esterhazy case, but no Dreyfus affair,
the whole matter will practically hang
on the guilt of the prisoner of the lie
dv Diable.
The people. Indeed, are logical when
they argue that if serious evidence has
been forthcoming against Ksterhazy, he
would have been promptly arrested. As
for the notorious memorandum, it is
affirmed on good authority that all ex
perts are of th>- opinion that it wan not
penned by the officers whom Mathieu
Dreyfus formally accused of having
written It, and inquiry has, moreover,
demonstrated that Count Esterhazy
could not possibly have had cognizance
"f four nf the papers mentioned In it.
The defenders of Dreyfus argue that
the commandant might have received
information from an official at the min
istry of war. but although they have
renefltedly been urged to he more ex
plicit they have not mentioned a single
name rr furnished the slightest proof.

NEW DANGER THREATENS.
An Outbreak Among the Friends of
Weyler In the Spanish Army-
Is Feared.
Copyright. 1898, by JameÂ» Gordon Bennett.
HAVANA, Jan. B.â l was informed
at the palace last night that Captain-
General Blanco will take the field on
or about January 15. It is stated that
he will go to Orient, but the exact
point is kept secret. There Is appar
ently good foundation for the report
that Ge/ieral Blanco will make an ef
fort to meet General Gomez and have
an interview on the probable settle
ment of the war on the basis of an
indemnity. It Is also generally be
lieved here that General Blanco has
directly or indirectly solicited United
States Consul-General Lee to exert his
good offices and accompany him to
meet Gomez.
Additional strength is given to the
rumor by the fact that General Lee
has within the last two days been sup
plied with a campaign saddle and
trappings. The Consul, however, de
nies all knowledge of any request
from General Blanco, and at the pal
ace the story will undoubtedly be
stamped as false. But all the official
denials do not shake the general belief
that negotiations direct with General
Gomez for the ending of the war are
about to be opened. Spanish officers
with whom I have talked express the
belief that the end of the war is near,
and will result either from war with
the United States or through the pur
chase of independence by Cubans. The
effect of autonomy is not seriously
considered by officers of the army.
To the danger which is threatened
now to the autonomical regime
through the volunteers is now added
the fear of an outbreak on the part of
General Weyler's many sympathizers
in the Spanish army. This has be
pome unmistakably apparent within
the last few days, and was well illus
trated Â«>n last Thursday, a high feast
day and the occasion of a bullfight in
Regis.
These bull fights are usually attended
by large numbers of Spanish soldiers 'â 
unarmed. The palace authorities, fear
ing some sort of a demonstration, had
present a full company of armed sol
diers on whom they felt they could de
pend. There is hardly any public fath
ering now without similar precautions.
In Artemisa this week members of
the autonomy committee organized a
picnic on the estate Toptuno, inviting a
large number of persons. Shortly after
th<- party arrived at the spot the rebel
chief Nunez swooped down on the par
ty and carried off all the provisions. In
Pinar Del Rio Province rebels are de
stroying th? tobacco crops.
New s concerning operations in Orient
Is being most diligently suppressed.
Ramon that the rebt-ls have besieged
Santiago de Cuba are current here, but
are without foundation. In Havana
and towns throughout this province,
the Herald's correspondents report that
everything is "wide open." Clothing
and provisions ar" being sent openly in
large quantities to rebels to prepare for
the next rainy season. The rebels con
tinue to burn cane, but no engage
ments of importance are reported.
MADRID, Jan. B.â lt is semi-officially
denied thai General Blanco has made
proposals to the Cuban insurgent lead
ers. The Cuban (Jovernment. it is an
nounced, will admit all those who rec
ognize its legality and make submission
to it, but will deal rigorously with for
eign adventurers.

NEW LAWS
ARE NEEDED
FOR ALASKA
Innovations Desired
by the People of '
the North.
Want Representation in
Congress, but Oppose
Taxation.
Their Country Too Unsettled
for a Territorial Form of
Government.
VIEWS OF LEADING MEN.
Proposition to Establish Three Judi
cial Districts Meets With Much
Support,
Special Correspondence of The Call.
PTTKA, Alaska, Dec. 26.â The most
Important topic in Alaska, now that
Congress is in session, exclusive of the
Klondike, is the question of legisla
tion for the district. The subject is
receiving more consideration here and
In Washington, D. C, than at any
time since the Russian colors were
lowered and the Stars and Stripes
raised to the breeze at Sitka^-October
18, 1867. The great diversified natural
â wealth of the districtâ for Alaska is
not a Territoryâ is Just beginning to be
recognized. Heretofore the world has
looked at a country one-third as large
as the whole United States over a cold
shoulder and shivered at the glance.
Now the universal indifference is gone,
and people are flocking from the four
corners of the earth into a region
"which the turn of a spade seems to
have transferred into a land of gold.
The next five years are expected to
bring the investment of more capital
Into Alaska than during all her pre
vious history. Half a dozen stamp
mills, for illustration, within a radius
of fifty miles of Juneauâ four of them
within five mi!es and all tributary to
that cityâ crunch large gold bricks out
of quartz every month. The surface
of this rich mineral belt, hundreds of
miles In extent, has hardly been
scratched over as yet. The best in
formed mining men in Alaska say that
many more and richer ledges remain
to be discovered.
Several million dollars is the value
of the annual output of the Salmon
canneries of the coast. Coal, iron and
copper beds have hardly been touched.
The fisheries present a mine of wealth.
A vast extent of mineral country, be
lieved to be rich,' has not even been
explored.
Inadequate and inapplicable laws de
lay the growth and development of
Alaska and her towns. The laws of the
Territory of Oregon in force in ISB4 ob
tain in Alaska, when n>t in conflict
â with Federal statutes. In many cases
these laws have, under existing condi
tions, been found as suitable as sandal
footwear is fit for travel over the ice
to Point Barrow.
An example of the need of legislation
providing for local self-government is
the present city of Juneau, which has
a population of about 3000. The com
munity is totally without any form of
municipal government. City improve
ments and growth are retarded be
cause there is no title to property. The
only peace officer is a Deputy United
States Marshal. He is the police force
of the town. Juneau is orderly, but
the comparative absence of crime is
due chiefly to the present limited
means of communication with the out
side world and the consequent diffi
culty of escape. Streets are irregular.
The only street grade is the sweet will
of the claimant of abutting propen.'-.
The system of water works is limited
and unreliable. The town could burn
down in a night. Insurance rates are
almost prohibitive. Business streets
have been planked at individual ex
pense. The liquor la%v is non-effective
and a farce from Cape Fox to the Arc
tic circle.
Smuggling of whisky is as safe and
easy as Bulling a cork from an after
dinner bottle in the house of friends.
Twenty-six unlicensed saloons do not
close their doors the year round.
Property in Alaska is not taxed.
Nothing in Alaska pays a cent of tax.
I am told that this fact strongly ap
peals to the investment of capital, and
that if a form of government or a
code of laws levying a tax were Im
posed capital would take wings for
other climes and the development of
the district's resources would be pro
portionately slow. This and other
things throw a number of elements of
complexity into the situation not easy
of solution. The general sentiment of
the people is in favor of a code of new
laws and representation on the floor
of Congress, but decidedly against tax
ation. In other words, the anomaly is
presented of a desire for representa
tion without taxation in any form.
Many men here arÂ» j apprehensive that
members of Congress, unfamiliar with
Alaska's conditions, will propose legis
lation that would be worse than the
present back-number statutes, or sorri'j
form of government that the popula
tion will not be able to maintain. Tlio
population of the district is estimated
to be at the present time 10,000 whites
and 30,000 natives. Leading men of
Alaska think that the district is not
yet ready for a Territorial form of
Government. There is also a wide
spread sentiment favoring the exten
sion of the United States land laws t..
Alaska.
Jn his rerent annual message Â«J)v
Â«rnor J. O. Brady expressed himself
In favor of a comnuMion to form a
code of laws, and against a Territorial
form of Government. He may r,o to
Washington this winter to keep an tyyt
on and assist in legislation for Alaska.
The following brief interviews propose
ways and means of legislation.
Ex-District Judge Delaney of Juneau
said: '"The land laws should be ex
tended to Alaska. We are not yet
ready for a Territorial form of Gov
ernment, for the reason that we are not
able to support it. I favor the appoint
ment of a commission to draft a code
of laws, and a delegate on the floor of
Congress."
United States District Attorney Bur
ton E. Bennett of Sitka says: "Alaska
is too large for any form of territorial
government, considering the present
population and its distribution. Alaska
Is one-third as large as the rest of the
United States. Communication be
tween her different ports is hard and
uncertain. Were she given a terri
torial '"m of srovernment it wpuld be
impossible to convene a Legislature
between seasons, as from November to
April there is absolutely no communi
cation from Sitka to the westward, a
distance of some 1600 miles. This in
cludes the important plÂ»oes of Â¥aku
â tat, Kodiak, Karluk and Unalaska. to
say nothing about the Cooks Inlet
country, including Sunrise City and
other growing towns of that section.
Of course everybody knows that there
is no reliable communication with the
great Yukon country for more than
seven months of the year. Thus even
a biennial session of a legislative body
is a physical impossibility unless at
tended by enormous expense.
"While Alaska has unbounded natur
al wealth, the development of her re
sources has not as yt-t reached the
point -where taxation, sufficient to sus
tain a territorial form of government,
would be other than an oppressive bur
den, which would retard investments
of capital and enterprises already es
tablished.
"Now, what form of government If
any shall we have under these con
ditions? I would propose that Alaska
be divided into three judicial districts,
the first to comprise Southeastern Alas
ka, extending from Sitka south to
Marys Island; the second, "Western
Alaska, extending from Sitka west
ward to Unalaska, including the Aleu
tian Islands; the third, the great Yu
kon Valley, from the British line to St.
Michael, with the regular Federal of
ficers in each district. There also should
be a delegate in Congress to represent
Alaska's needs. I am not prepared to
advance anything as to how this dele
gate should be chosen or paid. A com
mission composed of five men. who are
acquainted with the real needs and
conditions of Alaska, should be ap
pointed by the President to submit a
:ode of laws for the approval of Con
gress."
"The question. 'What form of gov
ernment should be granted to Alaska,
and what amendments or changes
should be made in the laws under
which our affairs have been adminis-
I tered since the organization of the dis-
I trtct in IS^4,' is one to which I have
i given sf.-me thought," said United
; States Commissioner John Ostrander
of Juncau. "My mind has been more
particularly directed to the law as it
, affects the office and duties of United
States commissioners, however, as be
ing of more immediate Interest and
Importance to myself. Upon the gen
; eral question. I am opposed to a ter
, ritorial form of government for Alaska.
We have not the population to support
i it, and our population is scattered
i over such an extent of country that
several territories would have to" be or
; ganized to afford substantial relief.
While I believe we have one of the
richest mineral districts in the world,
it is now comparatively an undevel
: oped country, and will require a great
; amount of capital to open up its re-
I sources.
"Self-government will bring taxes
; and uncertainties of legislation always
I attending the orpanizatio-n of new ter
ritories â two things that capital is or
dinarily afraid of. The fact that we
have now no taxes to pay is a great
inducement to capital. If* in addition
| to this. Congress will pive us a code
: of laws suitable to our condition, I pre
| diet that we will have no difficulty in
i finding men and money to help us in
; developing: the country.
"We should be given a representa
; tive in Congress who could have a
voice in shaping legislation affecting
our Interests; but, if with such a rep
resentative we have also to have a
local government, legislature, etc., we
had much better do without the
: former. The suggestion that a com
| mission to draft a code of laws for th*
] district be appointed is, I think, a good
one. Such a commission should consist
of at least five members â residents of
1 Alaskaâ so that all interests could
; have a representative upon the com
mission. It should meet in Alaska,
! where evils to be corrected and condi
! tions to be met and provided for would
!be ever present. We should have a
! code of laws covering every possible
| subject and interest in Alaskaâ a <â¢ dc
I in itself sufficient for all our needs,
i past, present and future being consid
| ered as far as posible.
"It would consume too muchtimeand
j space to detail the many incongruities
| of our present laws, and in what they
are inapplicable and insufficient. We
leave that for the commission to con
sider.
"I might state, for example, and as
an instance, that there is now con
fined In our local jail an insane man.
There is no way of disposing of him!
except to trump up some charge and
confine him in jail, at Sitka. thereon.
No provision is made for such cases.
"Before leaving this question, I
might suiiETost that any code of laws
for Alaska should make provision for
the incorporation of municipalities. I
believe in local sHf-government s.Â»
far as possible when compatible with
surrounding conditions and interests,
and I see no reason why such com
munities as Juneau should not be em
powered to adopt municipal rules and
regulations. The output of gold from
Alaska is having a very beneficial ef
fect in alleviating the conditions
brought about by the 'hard times' of
the last few years. It seems impossi
ble that Congress will continue to neg
lect us in the future as in the past.
We have a right to expect better
things, and. now that we are becoming
better known, will probably get them."
Albert D. Elliot, Secretary for
Alaska and Clerk of the United States
District Court, said: "There will be
much proposed legislation at this ses
sion of Congress. The question will
be, not how many bills will be intro
duced, but what can we obtain In the
way of beneficial legislation. I think
the general land laws of the United
States should be extended over this
territory, and additional Land Offices
established for the convenience of the
people. Thfre should be one at Circle
City, or in that section of the country.
There should be a Commission ap
pointed by the President of the United
States to draft a proper code of laws
for Alaska. The Oregon code, which
now governs us, is rather obsolete, and
unfitted for prespnt conditions. The
Commission should probably be five in
number, the majority being from this
territory and wÂ«U versed with the
nofds of the country. Congress should
give the right of way to railroad com
panies to cross the public domain, and
aid in the settling of this vast terri
tory. The cities and towns should be
permitted to incorporate as elsewhere.
"Provision should be made by Con
gress that this territory be represented
by a delegate, so that the needs of
Alaska can bo always presented on
the floor of the House of Representa
tives by one qualified to do so. Ido
not consider the time yet ripe for ter
ritorial government. The population
at present is uncertain and changing.
The great distance between the settle
ments and the small population would
make the necessary taxation a burden
and a hardship on the people. The
great trouble at this session of Con
gress will b*Â» to get such legislation as
will be a benefit to Alaska. Hun
dreds of bills will be introduced of all
kinds, and if from the mass of pro
posed legislation we obtain some of
the legislation suggested herein we
will be Indeed fortunate."

SCRIMMAGE IN
A LASSEN COURT
Lawyer Spencer Scores
Superior Judge
Kelley.
For Which He Is Subjected to
a Fine or $3O for
Contempt.
Then His Honor Steps From the
Bench and Vigorously Uses
His Fists.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SUSANVILLE. Jan. B.â The court
room of the Superior Court of Lassen
County was the scene of a most dis
graceful set-to to-day between E. V.
Spencer and Superior Judge F. G. Kel
ley. There has been for some time past
a feeling of bitterness between Law
yer Spencer and Judge Kelley, the for
mer losing no opportunity to qualify
the Judge as an incompetent and cor
rupt official.
This feajing culminated to-day dur
ing the trial of a case in which Spen
cer was attorney for one of the parties,
and in which it came in his way to
score Judge Kelley, who was presiding,
in a most unwarranted mannner. The
Judge's veracity and probity were
impugned and his official character
riddled by the angry attorney, who
seemed to be smarting under a sense
of wrong inflicted upon him by Kelley.
The Judge is not particularly noted
for his coolheadedness, and at length
interrupted Spencer's philippic by im
posing a tine of $i>o upon hton. This
only served to increane the fervor of
Spencer's invectives, and the Judge,
losing entire control of himself.
Jumped from the bench and assaulted
Spencer, striking him two or three
harmless blows before interference
could prevent. The assaulted attorney
made no attmpt at retaliation in kind t
although he is commonly accorded the
reputation of a man fully competent
to defend himself and one who has
proved his physical courage on many
occasions.
The affair is regarded here by law
yers and laymen as the legitimate out
come of a laxity of Judicial and profes
sional etiquette, which has come to be
more honored in the breach than in the
observance. It is probable that the af
fair, disgraceful as it was, will not be
allowed to end with the simple narra
tive of its occurrence, although it
would be doubtless best for all parties
if it were allowed to do so. Public
opinion seems to be evenly divided as
to where the blame rests for to-day's
scrap. _____^^_^_
TOOK CITY AND
COUNTY MONEY
Charles M. Shane Is Wanted
at Tacoma for Numer
ous Peculations.
Tried to Win Back His Stealings by
Gamblingâ He Probably Left
for This City.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Jan. B.â Mayor Fawcett to
day swore out a warrant charging
Charles M. Shane, municipal court
clerk until January 1. with embezzling
$590 of city money. He also took $145
of county money. Shane is supposed to
have gone to San Francisco from Port
land, where he was last seen. Officers
in both cities were requested by wire
to-day to arrest him if f<-und. Shane
handled all fines and costs paid into the
municipal court. He was appointed
three years ago through the influence
of his brother-in-law, John A. Shack
leford, a prominent politician.
For some time past Shane has been
spending money freely, borrowing of
friends to make up what his $100 sal
ary did not provide. In October a
young officer of the steamer City of
Puebla stopped over here for one trip
of the steamer, and Shane entertained
him. The officer then invited Shane to
accompany him to San Francisco. He
found life there both gay and expen
sive, and in two weeks had used up
$190 of city money, which he took Just
before leaving, as is now learned.
He then telegraphed Judge Leavltt
of the municipal court for money to get
home on. Returning on November 9,
he apparently tried to win back his
stealings by gambling, but luck went
against him. It is thought he then be
gan to steal systematically, for be
tween November 9 and October 24 he
took enough more to make his steal
ings $735. On December 24 he went to
Portland, and has not returned.

Funeral of a Man Who Had Previously Lost
Both Legs and an Arm Through
Accidents.
GIRARDVILLE. Pa.. Jan. B.âWil
liam F. Parks, aged 70, was buried at
Gowan City, a few miles from here,
yesterday. His body was placed in a
grave which already contained both
his legs and one arm. He was born at
Detroit, where he married Bessie
Woodruff, who lived only a year after
ward. After her death he broke his
leg, and as a result of blood poisoning
three amputations were performed.
After his recovery he married a sister
of his dead wife, and while they were
on their wedding trip the train was
wrecked. His second wife was killed,
and his other leg had to be amputated
as the result of his injuries. This leg
was burled by the side of the first. At
his father's funeral Parks was injured
by a locomotive crashing into his car
riage. He lost an arm in this accident,
and it was buried with his two legs.
Since that time he has paid weekly
visits to the cemetery, wheeling him
self on a chair carriage with one arm.
TO PROTECT THE RAISIN INDUSTRY.
Fresno County Farmers' Club Meets and
Takes an Important Step.
FRESNO, Jan. B.â The Fresno County
Farmers" Club took an Important step
thife afternoon In regard to the raisin in
dustry. The proposition advanced was
one looking to securing a uniform grad
ing of raisins, and the next Legislature
will be asked to pass a law providing for
box inspectors, whose duty it will be to
see that the public shall not be imposed
upon by an inferior quality of raisins la
beled as a better class. After a full dis
cussion of the matter the club concluded
to urge such a provision. It was argued
that it would benefit the gTowefÃ aa well
as thp buyers, as then the Fresno prod
uct would not .be discriminated against,
i It is claimed that he raisin industry of
this county has suffered by raisins of a
lower grade being sold in the East as a
superior quality.

Special Plf>rÂ«tch to The Call.
PHOENIX, Ariz., Jan. B.â lt became
known to-night that Phoenix had lost
its leading auctioneer and William

whose husband is inconsolable. Both
have been missing from their homes
since last Sunday, but only to-day was
it learned that they went together on
a sleeper, bound for San Francisco.
An interesting collateral circum
stance is that Mrs. King's sister, a Mrs,

HORSES TAKEN
FOR THE DEBT
Novel Method of Collec
tion on the Colorado
Desert
A Determined Creditor Stops a
Stage Coach to Secure
His Claim.
Unhitches the Steeds and Drive*
Them Off-Now He Will Bo
Prosecuted.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. B.â Out at
Twenty Mile Paims, -,n the Colorado
Desert, they have original Ideas about
the collection of debts. If one man
owes another any money and fails to
pay It the creditor takes whatever he
can find belonging to the debtor with
out any process of law and holds it un
til the debt Is discharged. John Hen
ricksen followed the custom of the
country in collecting a debt due him,
and now a Deputy United States Mar
shal has gone to bring him in, for he
has violated a Federal statute.
John had been working for a stage
company which operates a line be
tween Twenty Mile Palms and some of
the interior mining camps, and he
claimed â probably with reason â that
the company owed him money and
would not pay him. So when the stage
left a few days ago he was at a con
venient place with a well loaded shot
gun and ordered the driver, Ora
Pierce, to stop, which he did. The idea
was first prevalent among those on
the vehicle that it was a case of stage
robbery, but the man soon disabused
them of this by telling them they
could go their ways, and he did not
molest the treasure box or the mail
pouches. He simply said he wanted
his pay and he intended to take the
stage horses as security. So he un
harnessed the animals and drove them
to his corral and has been caring for
them ever since.
The mail and the coach are still
there. Deputy Marshal Pourade of
San Bernardino has gone to tell the
custodian of the impounded animals
what kind of a scrape he is in and the
stage company will be permitted to
continue delivering the mail to the
treasure hunters of the dt-sert.
Driver Pierce tells a thrilling tale
of the determination of the enraged
creditor of the stage company to have
security for his money. He would
have killed any one who interfered
with his taking the horses.

SEAMEN RESCUED FROM
A DRIFTING BOAT.
Some of the Crew of the Lost Steamer
Radcliffe Picked Up, but Many Have
Undoubtedly Perished.
FALMOUTH, Eng., Jan. B.â The tug
Triton landed here to-day the captain,
mate, cook and a seaman of the Brit
ish steamer Clarissa Radcliffe, which
was abandoned January 1 near Cape
Finisterre in a sinking condition.
Nineteen of the crew procured life
belts and got on board the boats. Ow
ing to the heavy sea running the boats
were all smashed excepting one, which
was floated off the steamer in a sound
condition, but without oars. To this
the cook and the seaman swam, and
after getting on board picked up the
master and the mate, who had been
washed overboard. They were unable
to render assistance to the remainder
of the crew. The steamer, it is said,
foundered within twenty minutes af
ter the survivors left her. The men
were helplessly adrift in an open boat
for seven hours.

TERRIER AND COON FIGHT A
DRAW.
Columbia State.
Yesterday afternoon a large coon was
brought to the Hotel Jerome The ani
mal was released in the courtyard. It
did not take many minutes for "Pat,"
the spirited little terrier who is master
of everything about the hotel, to find
out that the coon was around. Then
he made for the coon and the coon
made for him, and a terrific battle en
sued.
The animals were about the same
size and were evenly matched. For
I three-quarters of an hour they fought
! like tigers In the jungle, neither ever
j showing the slightest indication of giv
! ing up. At one time the dog would get
a good grip on the coon and shake
I him; then the coon would get loose
and fly at the dog. getting a Hrm hold
on his neck and using his feet to much
effect. Plenty of blood was drawn.
. Guests of the hotel came to their win
dows and witnessed the furious fight.
Finally both dog and coon got so ex
hausted that they could merely watch
i each other and exchange growls.
It ended in a draw, the coon being
on the defensive when the porters took
charge of Pat and placed him under
the spout.

MANY REGISTERS
ARE STUFFED
Sensational Features in the
Corning Parliamentary
Election.
Attempts Made to Fraudulently Vote
the Names of Sons of High
English Officials.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Jan. B.â A dispatch to
the World from Dublin says: The
Parliamentary election now proceed
ing in St. Stephens Green division of
Dublin have suddenly developed a sen
sational feature. A vacancy arose
through the appointment of a sitting
member, William Kenny, to a Judge
ship in the Supreme Court.
The Government delayed this ap
pointment until the new year so it
could have the advantage of fighting
the election on the new voting regis
ter, which is more favorable to them
than was that of last year.
Now it has been discovered that the
register has been stuffed with bogus
votes under the lodger franchise. The
sons of seven Judges of the Supreme
Court, of high Government officials and
of other leading Unionists have been
fraudulently put on the register in
considerable numbers under the pre
tense that they were lodgers paying
rent of from $2 to $3 weeftly for rooms
in their father's house.
The scandal has become so great that
several Judges and other high officials
have written to the press that their
voting claims were made without their
or their sons' knowledge, and were
in fact, forgeries.
Every day fresh batches of names are
unearthed and a demand is now being
powerfully urged on the Government
to prosecute for conspiracy the Union
ist agents in Dublin who are respon
sible for preferring these bogus claims.
The Unionist Government, of course,
is trying to ignore its duty in the mat
ter, but the frauds have attracted such
widespread attention that it is doubt
ful if the Government can afford to do
so.
The candidates in the present elec
tino are James Campbell, Unionist, a
lawyer, and Count Plunkett, a Par
nellite, who is being supported by the
Dillonites. Under the circumstances the
contest is expected to be close, and if
Count Plunkett succeeds in wresting
this seat from the Unionists it cannot
fail to work powerfully for unity
among all Irish Nationalists.

MAJOR MOSES
P. HANDY DEAD
Expires at Augusta, Ga.,
, Where He Had Gone
to Recuperate.
Close of the Career of the Well-
Known Editor and
Writer.
HU Health Undermined While Acting
as Commissioner at the Paris
Exposition.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HOTEL BONAIR. AUGUSTA, Ga.,
Jan. B.â Major Moses P. Handy died at
noon to-day. The remains will be
taken to Berlin, Md., for burial.
Major Handy was stricken with the
illness which ended with his death
while he was preparing to leave Paris
for America after completing his work
as commissioner to the exposition.
Never a very strong man, the strain of
his position had told heavily on him and
he was advised by his physicians to
give up the more trying work of the
mission. But he persisted until two
days before the date set for sailing,
when he was overcome by what ap
peared to be temporary weakness,
which made him postpone his depart
ure. He was nervously broken down
and his condition was rendered worse
by Impaired circulation and faulty
heart action.
The French physicians advised abso
lute rest and he remained in Franca
for two weeks. Brfore he got to New
York he succumbed again, but pulled
himself together and came to Wash
ington, and then to Chicago. In Chi
cago he appeared to regain vitality,
but his pride in his mission led him to
plunge into the work of preparing his
report. It was no surprise to his
friends to hear that he had succumbed
while on his way to Washington, con
gestion of the lungs and kidneys in
creasing the gravity of the attack.
He was removed to Georgia, where he
lost strength gradually, and while his
friends hoped to the end that his cour
age would save him, they were warned
that the chances were all against his
recovery. Hrs wife accompanied him
to the South, and his son, A. W. Han
dy, left Chicago for Georgia Thursday.
.Major Moses P. Handy was born in
Virginia, his father being a prominent
Methodist clergyman. While under age
he entered the Confederate service and
served with gallantry during the clos
ing months of the war. He was
employed by the New York Tribune as
special correspondent during the Cuban
troubles, and won distinction by his
report of the Virginius massacre. Later
he became managing editor of the Phil
adelphia Times, and subsequently the
editor of the Philadelphia Daily News.
He was one of the founders and for
many years president of the Clover
Club of Philadelphia. He moved to
Chicago in 1893 to accept the position
of chief of the bureau of publicity and
promotion of the World's Columbian
Exposition. At the close of the fair he
went to New York and engaged in lit
erary work and newspaper correspond
ence for a year. He returned to Chi
cago as the editor of the Times-Herald
in 1*95 when the paper was purchased
by H. H. Kohlsaat. Last May Major
Handy was appointed special commis
sioner to the Paris exposition, where he
rendered valuable service.
"Can't afford to fire them, can't I?"
snorted Nebuchadnezzar, full of wrath.
"Why, great Scott! I've got Hebrew
children to burn!"
A few hours later, however, as he
looked into the fiery furnace, into
which he had cast them, he muttered,
disappointedly:
"Oh! I don't know! You ain't so
warm!"
And the remark went thundering
down the ages. â Puck.HANNA IS

Special Dispatch to Thf Call.
COLUMBUS. Ohio, Jan. 8â Senator
Hanna thinks to-night his election is
sure. His managers say they see the
necessary seventy-three votes for him.
and that the tide of popular sentiment
that is now being felt will make his
vote larger than is necessary next
Tuesday. The Senator's managers
c!:i!m that if a ballot were taken to
night Hanna would be elected by 75
to 70. The opposition concede the
loss of Representative Manuel of
Montgomery only, and say they Btlll
have votes to spare In defeating
Hanna,
During the day there has been a list
of bets posted at the Neil House,
ranging from $600 to $5000, or any part
thereof, at even money, on the elec
tion of Hanna. and other private wag
ers were offered, but none were taken.
There was $8000 deposited at the Nell
House office for even bets on Hanna,
and it remains there.
Reports fmm indignation meetings
in the counties to-day and to-night are
pouring into the Hanna headquarters.
These meetings of the clubs, county
committees and other organizations, at
which speeches were made and resolu
tions adopted against Governor Bush
nell, the bolting Republican members
and others, will not be continued un
less there is a deadlock next week.
These who have b<?en holding meetings
at their homes this week will be here
Monday for the general mass meeting
that has been called by the Repub
lican State Committee, the same as the
1 metingrs have been called by the
county committees.
The ceremonies for the inauguration
of. Governor Bushnell occur at noon
. rxt, and the mass meeting
is aii7iour.c?d for 2:30 p. m. As the
inaugural exercises will %iot be over
when the mass meeting begins, there
is intense feeling among the friends of
Governor Bushnpll, Mr. Kurtz and
others because this meeting was called
at a time when it would conflict with
the inauguration. The State Commit
tee explains that many who will be
â here on Monday expect to leave on the
evening trains, and that no later hour
could be fixed for the meeting, at
which strong resolutions will, no
doubt, be adopted against the newly
inaugurated Governor, the " bolting "
.Republican members of the Legisla
ture, and others. The clubs that re
fused to participate in the inaugura
tion will attend the mass meeting in
bodi-ps, and there are fears of serious
collisions on the streets.
While it Is apprehended that there
may be hisses and all sorts of insults
to the Governor during the inaugura
tion parade, it is known that there have
been special arrangements made to
protect his excellency from personal
violence. Serious trouble is feared dur
ing the Inauguration and at the mass
meeting and especially on Monday
night, after both of these occasions are
over. The attendance will be much
greater than ever before on inaugura
tion day. The railways report their in
capacity in some places to furnish suf
ficient cars for all who want to come.
The reports indicate that the excur
pionists are mostly the members of Re
publican clubÃ and citizens who want
td attend the mass meeting and parti
cipate in other public expressions of in
dignation at those Republican mem
bers of the Legislature who refuse to
abide by the action of their last State
convention in Toledo.
Speaker Mason called on Senator
Hanna to-day and spent two hours in
conference. This conference was fol
lowed by all sorts of rumors, but it 1r
not believed there was any agreemf-nt
reached between them. There were
those who had no authority to speak
for Hanna, insisting that Mason would
yet he ousted and that the House
would be completely reorganized n^xt
week.
While the doubtful Republicans seem
to be drifting toward the Hanna col
umns, there Is still trouble with somÂ»
â¢of the Democratic members, who do
not want to vote for a Republican for
Senator. ,'/
It la for this reason that the Demo
cratic members will hold a joint Sena
torial caucus on Monday night, so as
to try to enforce the unit rule on the
Senatorial vote. Unless this is done it
seems certain that no one except Han
na can be elected on the first ballot.
The Hanna men are confident that if
any of their doubtful men should not
vote with them on the first ballot.
no one could be elected on that ballot,
owing to the Democratic vote being
scattered.
. It was announced weeks ago that
there would be a conference here this
afternoon of Democrats from all parts
of the State on a proposed plan for a
new departure, or reorganization of the
party. There were over 100 present,
but the conference adjourned without
definite action because of a contest
over the resolution as to who was en
titled to vote at primaries. The reso
lution provided that only those were
entitled to vote at primaries who had
.voted the Democratic ticket at the pre
vious election. After a long debate the
resolutions were referred to a commit
tee of nine to report to the Democratic
conference. There was no opposition
to the plank for the free and unlimited
coinage of silver. This conference was
independent of the Jackson Day ban
quet to-night, and of the Sen
ate-rial contest, but the present coali
tion of the Democratic members of the
Legislature with ten bolting Republic
an members was the principal topic
among- the visiting Democratic states
men.

tives of the State that I was their choice
for Speaker pro torn. When I was' led
to believe " that there was an organized
effort to form a slate on which ray name
was not to be considered it was very nat
ural for me at least to feel chagrined,
not so much In losing what seemed to be
a kindly offering to me. as that the lead
ers of the organizations appeared to Ig
nore my candidacy. Wise or unwise I
resolved to help break the slate, which
could be only accomplished in the way
â it was done. During the time I was en
gaged In this movement 1 still expected
to vote for Mr. Hanna for Senator as I
afterward so stated to him and some of
my constituents who called on After

of January 4. UK, in which I declined to
vote for Mr. Hanna. . In supporting the
organization, in which, however. 1 in
sisted that every officer from Speaker to

found that I had offended my Republican
constituents, and I. felt it would not bo
pleasant to return home. On the 6th Inst

for myself the true situation. Many of
my " constituents from all parts of the

know that the growing sentiment among
Republicans of this county against Sen

not exist, but that his adherents, us I
now believe, ar^ stronger and more nu

COMPLETE THE WORK THIS TIME-
ONCE more the Supervisors have undertaken
the task of providing some means for pro
tecting the people against the ever present
danger of being run over by the street cars. The
subject has been under consideration intermit
tently for a long time. Every now and then an
accident of more than ordinary horror occurs to
arouse popular indignation, and straightway the
Supervisors set about talking of doing something.
By and by the indignation passes, then the talk
passes and the something that was to be done re
mains undone.
This time the Supervisors should take action.
There should be no talk on the matter except that
which tends to activity. There should be a limit
to the discussion, a period fixed when a decision
will be made, an ordinance adopted and enforced
and the limbs and lives of citizens made reason
ably safe from the dangers that menace them.
The people arc not asking for an impossibility.
It is within the powers of the street car companies
to use their property and carry on their business
in such a way that it will not be a menace to the
community. It is also within the powers of the
Supervisors and the police to compel them to do
so if they refuse to act willingly. The reform is
; -ible as well as imperative, and therefore should
be carried
It will co>t the Supervisors some mental effort
to devise and enact a proper ordinance on the sub
ject. It will cost the police some exercise of
energy to enforce the ordinance after it is enacted.
It may cost the people something to defend and
maintain the ordinance in the courts. It will cost
the railway companies something to equip their
cars with proper fenders and proper brakes. It
nay cost them something to be compelled to em
ploy more men and not overwork their employes
on the cars until they are too tired to attend to
their duties.
These costs in the aggregate may be consider
able, but however large they will be cheap in com
parison with the cost of continuing the present
system. To run the street cars at present costs
anxiety, bruises, wounds, broken limbs, mangled
bodies, and not infrequently costs life itself.
Many persons have been killed by the cars in thin
city under circumstances which amount virtually to
unjustifiable homicide. We have been permitting
the companies for already too long a time to run
their cars and carry on their business at such a
cost.
Popular indignation has been so frequently
aroused by some shocking accident due to careless
ness on the part of the companies that it no longer
passes away when the shock of the death passes. It
has. become chronic. It is now insistent, urgent,
clamorous for redress and justice. This time the
Supervisors must take action. Public safety re
quires it. Popular sentiment demands it.
OUR JUBILEE EDITION.
WE are now able to give assurance to the pub
lic that the grand edition of The Call to be
issued as a part of the jubilee celebration of
the discovery of gold in California and as an adjunct
to the exposition of mines and mining will be the
most comprehensive and accurate review of the his
tory and present conditions of Pacific Coast mining
ever published.
In a general way the work will deal with mining
the world over and with all features of the recent
development of the industry, but in the main it will
be devoted to the gold and silver mining of the Pa
cific Coast. In that particular field it will cover
every subject of historic interest or present value.
The student of its pages will learn what California
mining was in the past and what it is to-day. He
wifl acquire the fullest and latest information of the
developments of each gold district on the coast,
from the tropic sands of Mexico to the frozen fields
of Alaska.
Care will be exercised to have each of the varied
subjects treated with strict fidelity to truth and with
scientific accuracy. The leading articles will be con
tributed by experts of acknowledged authority in
tl.eir lines of work. These papers will be instruc
tive as well as interesting. They will reward the
study of all who have any intention to engage in
mining on any part of the Pacific Coast, and will
repay even the general reader who desires to have
an intelligent comprehension of the development of
mining since the day when Marshall discovered the
golden nugget at Sutter's mill and set the hardy and
ambitious manhood of the world traveling this way
in search of adventures and fortune.
As an adjunct to the mining exposition the edi
tion will be invaluable as it will furnish information
enabling Ili<* visitor to understand every important
feature ol tlu- exhibits from those which show the
crude placer mining implements of the days of '49
.to tin Quarts crushing machinery of the mighty
mining mills of to-day. It is to appear on the Sun
day brfore the exposition opens, and will therefore
be timely and opportune for all who come.
HEED THE PLEA OF THE WEAK.
THE statement of China's case by Li Hung
Chang has attracted worldwide attention. It
is an appeal to the nations against the de
struction of Chinese sovereignty and autonomy,
?nd it raises against European aggression an ar
gument that cannot be passed over in silence. This
Confucian diplomat and statesman has pricked the
conscience of the Christian world, and if his coun
try is to be the victim of division among the
powers his statement will stand, crying through
all coming history an accusing voice to impeach
Christian civilization.
But, after all, this remarkable plea for his coun
try's life is not stronger by a single word nor a
single principle than the appeal made to the
United States by the Hawaiians against the forci
ble destruction of their autonomy and the seizure
of their sovereignty. Behind the voice of Li Hung
Chang are 400,000,000 people. Behind the Ha
waiian lite-test arc only 40,000, but each rests upon
t lie i-ame principle, which is deserving of respect,
whether those in whose behalf it is pleaded number
hundreds or hundreds of millions.
There be those in this country who wonder why
Germany turns a deaf ear to China. But why
should we wonder if we hear not the cry and spurn
the prayer of the Hawaiians?
Inddeu it is repeated with tiresome reiteration
that lawless aggression against China strengthens
the cause of equally lawless aggression bythis coun
try against Hawaii. The excuse is, in part, the old
one, that possession of Hawaii is necessary to our
Chinese trade. If owning an island in the tropics
is necessary to that, why do we propose to treat
the occupation of Chinese ports by Russia, Ger
many and France as inimical to our trade?
The farce of it is exposed to the laughter of the
world by Senator Morgan's declaration that
Europe is putting a commercial cordon against us
reaching from Manchuria to Manchester. If this
elongated and grandiloquent statement were true
how can we cut the cordon with Hawaii?
An Eastern Senator discussing annexation re
cently said that "lie would have to vote for it be
cause all our ships passing to and from Asia have
to stop there. Senator Perkins can inform him that
they don't have to do any such thing. The short
route to Asia lies 1600 miles north of Hawaii, and
can be traversed from continent to continent with
out rccoaling.
Our Pacific liners do not all regularly touch at
Honolulu because it is out of the path of com
merce. For all these reasons we have not even the
excuse that Europe has for aggression upon China.
The commercial argument may be used in that case
but not in ours. We propose to rob a weak peo
ple for other than the reasons we give to the
world. The real reason is that the planters have
had the money and have put it where it will do the
most good. Their stake is a protected profit of $19
a ton on raw sugar. No great nation was ever be
fore stood up and dishonored by such a small
force. '
A SHAMELESS BOODLER.
NOTWITHSTANDING our attempt CO convey
to its debased mind the intelligence that in ad
vocating a franchise "cinch" for the new char
ter it is wasting its energy, the Mission street
Boodler still persists in its shameless course. The
Boodler is evidently incorrigible. In support of its
"cinch" it declares that we know nothing about
journalism and less about the charter. As for our
knowledge of the constitution and the laws it has a
sublime contempt for it.
Inasmuch as the Boodler does not deign to point
out wherein we are mistaken in our interpretation
of the constitution and statutes, we can do no better
than plead guilty to the charge of being entirely ig
norant of journalism â that is, journalism as under
stood and practiced in the office of the Boodler. For
instance, we do not know how to falsify telegrams
We are ignorant of the art of concocting lies about
public events, and even if we were versed in it we
would not dare to print them. We do not under
stand the business of publishing false "want" adver
tisements, and our conscience would not permit us
to circulate anonymous circulars libeling our busi
ness rivals, even if we were not too cowardly to
print them. In that department of journalism which
negotiates "advertising" contracts calling for cdi
torial silence at $1000 a month we are also com
pletely unversed.
The reflection that we know nothing of the art
01 journalism as understood and practiced by the
Boodler, however, brings one consolation. Our ig
norance is shared by reputable newspapers through
out the world. So far as our observation extends.
the journalism practiced by the Mission street
Boodler is uniquely distinct. Not only does the
Boodler contract away its editorial liberty at a stip
ulated sum per month, but the moment it sees a
chance to make a better contract it repudiates its
obligations.
This was the history of the famous $30,000 "ad
vertising" contract. The Boodler remained on the
Southern Pacific payroll for twenty-two months,
drawing for its silence the princely sum of $22,000.
At the end of that period there began the mad rush
of the demagogues to the rescue of the railroad
strikers of 1894. The Boodler perceived an oppor
tunity to get an increase of pay. Like the strikers,
it struck. But Mr. Huntington considered the price
he was paying for the Boodler's friendship suffi
cient. He stood firm and the contract fell.
Thus the Boodler achieved the dazzling distinc
tion of being a corruptionist who will not stay
bought â a journalistic role in which it stands un
rivaled in the newspaper world.
The Boodler may be surprised at the statement,
but we are proud of our ignorance of this kind of
journalism. All we know about the newspaper
business is tc publish truthful and reliable news. It
may be stupid, but we accept only such money for
advertising as the legitimate results of the business
justify patrons in paying. We know nothing about
franchise "cinches," nor about blackmailing water
or gas companies. We trust the Boodler will par
don our interference with its attempt to again "hold
up" the Southern Pacific Company. Our view of
the law governing street railway franchises was pre
sented in the kindliest spirit. If the Boodler had
any sense it would not abuse us for endeavoring to
save it the time and mental wear and tear of prose
cuting a "cinch" which is bound to prove profit
less.
Inasmuch as the Spanish are sane, there may be
something in the rumor that they are beginning to
favor a protectorate for Cuba. But as to the alle
gation that they favor the institution by the

is naturally weak and gropes about for something
to lean against
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 9, 1898.
A BATTLE FOR CALIFORNIA.
j"^\URING tfw whole period of her existence
I )as a Federal State California has continu
ously paid into the treasury of the Union
more than her proportional share of taxes and rev
enues. Her people have been loyal to every na
tional aspiration. Her delegates to Congress, with
the approval of their constituents, have liberally
and willingly voted money from the common treas
ure to promote every form of public enterprise
that promised to advance the welfare of any im
portant section of the nation. She has contributed
by her taxes to the seacoast or interior improve
ments of every State in the Union from Maine to
Texas, from Washington to Florida. She has
given dollars in taxation where she has received
pennies in appropriations.
The time has now come in the development of
the State when her delegates in Congress must ask
from the Representatives of other States a response
to the unsectional liberality shown by Californians
in the past. Our commercial and industrial wel
fare requires the improvement of the vast river
system which drains the great valleys of the State.
The work will be expensive even if undertaken at
once, but it will be much more expensive if de
layed. Therefore the improvement is not only im
portant in itself, but it is imp6rtant to have it be
gun at the earliest date possible.
Congressman De Vries has introduced into the
House a bill providing an appropriation of $500,
000 for the improvement of the Sacramento River
and its tributaries. This brings the issue before the
nation and puts the claim of California fairly be
fore the Representatives of other States she has
done so much to help. The amount asked for is
not excessive. On the contrary it is moderate to
the degree of modesty. It can be defended on
every score of enterprise or economy. It is a
measure that should find supporters in all parties
and from all sections of the Union.
We will be foolish, however, if we sit idle and
expect support to come to us as a grateful response
for services rendered in the past. What California
has a right to ask from the General Government is
not often recalled beyond the Rockies. To ob
tain the desired appropriation will require some
thing more than the asking. It will require a con
test. The introduction of the bill means a battle
for California and the Californians must do the
fighting.
The first thing to be done is to rouse the whole
State to action. If we can once get the people to
will strongly to win the fight it will be virtually
half won from that moment. We are so far from
Washington that we neglect our interests there.
We do not back up our Congressmen as the Rep-
resentatives of other States are backed. That is
the reason they have so often failed in issues where
they might have won successes that would have
been widely beneficial.
In this battle for the improvement of the rivers
every sort of organization in the State should take
part. Let us advance to the attack with all the ac
tivities and energies of our people. The official
authorities of the State, of counties and cities, com
mercial and industrial bodies, labor unions, mer
; chants, farmers, mining men, all men of influence
and personal force should take part in the contest.
We can win if we put forth the full strength of the
State. It is a battle for California which by will
power and determination we can convert into vic
tory.
The offer of the Santa Fe to leu-e a train to the
Populists of Kansas might result in some embarrass
ment fo the road. The idea is to prove that the
train could not be operated .it a less cost to passen
gers than the company charges now. But it is a
safe wager that if the Populists had a train of their
own some of them would ride who never think of
such a luxury at present, and that the cars would be
so crowded that "standing room" only would be a
regular sign. Then fares would be reduced, a pre
cedent established. and nothing left the road but to
go into insolvency.
It is not pleasant to speak of the Bulletin, once
a newspaper but now something else, but its boast
of having "scooped" contemporaries is worth one
brief notice for two reasons. The first is that it is
untrue, and the second that, even if true, it would
be of not the slightest importance. The public
does not expect news from the sheet in question,
and asks no more than that it refrain from the
bunko business.
The statement is made that New York is to be
wide open, prize-fights and all. This is. to those
having the happiness to live far from New York,
most cheering intelligence. Perhaps it will be
wide enough open to take in a lot of pugilists who
are loafing around here, and in the absence of a
chance to get into the ring are drifting naturally
into Mission street journalism.
A burglar whose picture was printed in The Call
and led to his identification goes to the penitentiary
with hard feelings against this paper. Thus is art
discouraged. Another paper might have printed the
picture in such a manner that it could not have been
recognized and the burglar been permitted to retain
his freedom and the privilege of holding the press
in high regard.
In most of the litigation concerning the salary
of Gladys Wallis the public has been taken into con
fidence, but only to a certain point. It has never
had the satisfaction of knowing whether Manager
Frawley took the lady across his knee and spanked
her, or if this was a baseless rumor. And the pub
lic would have liked to know.
According to the Coroner Dow was murdered,
and according to the police he killed himself. In
the light of experience would it not be wise for
these two aggregations of wisdom to adopt a com
promise verdict admitting cautiously that Dow is
dead?
The Oakland Judge who has derided that chick
ens are animals deserves thanks for having added
a notable chunk to the sum of human knowledge.
It may be considered that the old notion that a
chicken is a vegetable has been completely dis
pelled.
Blanco's plan to enter the field against Gomez
will be watched with some interest. Weyler used to
have considerable fun in making similar plans, but
he got out of the field again with a celerity Blanco
can hardly hope to equal.
"The new terror of the navy" has not been de
scribed yet, but it may be the order just promul
gated by the Secretary that the men must not swear.
Since an evening paper affirms that Durrant is
dead, and repeats the allegation three times, we arc
inclined to agree with it
WITH ENTIRE FRANKNESS.
BY HENRY JAMES.
There was an interesting story in the
Examiner of last Sunday concerning a
man who had been caught in an ava
lanche. Naturally the first impulse of
a man after escaping from" an ava
lanche would be to write to the Exam
iner and describe the emotions which
filled him during his descent, and por
traying with some particularity the
rude treatment that had jarred his sys
tem and torn his clothes. But it hap
pened that the tale had already ap
peared in the New York Sun of the
Sunday before and had by that honest
journal been credited to the Colorado
Springs Gazette of date unspecified.
Can it be possible that the Examiner
had merely taken this piece of reprint,
directed it to itself and run it as hav
ingcome from the snow-pelted hero who
had drifted down with the slide? Verily
I fear so. There is no form of misrep
resentation of which the yellow journal
would not rather be guilty. For
one I distrust It so thoroughly that
seeing the name of a friend in its obit
uary column I would be thrilled by a
reasonable hope that the friend was
among the living.
Clara Fallmer is reported on good au
thority to have wept upon hearing the
verdict of "not guilty" pronounced in
her favor. Naturally any girl in a sim
ilar position would have given some ev
idence of concern. Tears do not neces
sarily indicate the presence of grief.
People weep for joy, for surprise, go
into briny dissolution for any excuse or
for no excuse. An analysis of the Fall
mer reason for turning loose the tor
rent would show it to have a logical
basis, and heartless inrteed would bÂ«?
the impulse to dam her lachrymal
ducts. The girl had been acquitted,
vindicated after having killed a man.
She had made the plea of insanity,
which I believe was the veriest pre
tense. That she was ever crazy, that
she ever thought she had been crazy
or that the excellent citizens composing
the jury ever entertained such an idea
I do not for a moment believe. They
were governed by an as yet unproved
theory that among the inherent rights
of the female is that of slaying the
male. If it was Clara's legitimate
privilege to put the particular vic
tim she selected out of the way, there
is no ground for opposing the de
sire of any woman to put any man
out of the way. Concerning this
view there have been some expressions
of doubt, enough, in fact, to create a
feeling of uneasiness on the part of any
lady making bold to act upon it. Thus
Clara must have experienced not only
a sense of relief, but realized that by
her firmness and her pistol she had for
tified in its immunity the sex she hon
ors and adorns, and opened wider to it
the promising field of murder; surely
â¢nough to account for tears of joy. Or
PÂ»-rhaps these crystal drops were for
the twelve in the jury box, who by a
few sobs and a pretty face have been in
duced to set the seal of approval upon
a policy which in the fullness of time I
trust may be fatal to some of them.
Any young woman who feels the need
>f divertisement is at liberty to go gun
ning after any young man. or old one
f. >r that matter. There is no closed sea
son. At certain periods the quail is
protected, the deer may roam fearless,
the duck quack with none to make him
afraid. But man must take chances
that owing to his own amiability as a
target are growing appreciably less. I
hope Clara will not make too free use
of her license to slaughter. Let her be
generous and lend her gun to some oth
er girl pining for innocent amusement.

Massachusetts women are trying:
hard to keep one of their number from
the practice of law. Their noble im
pulse to prevent her earning bread \f>
based on the supposition that she is not
>s good as they are. If a woman whose
â ife has not been above the veiled and
insinuating reproach of her spotless sis
ters choose to enter upon a profession
which may be honorable. It does not
seem to me the spotless sisters are bur
r.ishing their own halos by taking the
role of dogs in the manger, never a dig
nified role, and particularly out of
touch with the benign spirit supposed
to glorify and dominate a sex far bet
ter than mine. 1 hope the lone woman,
combated by the holy throng, will tri
umph over them and that in the end
they may have the grace to be
ashamed. If a strict moral test were to
be applied to men who seek places "at
the bar many an eloquent voice would
be hvxhed and the few attorneys left
would have more business than they
could attend to. While sorry that any
woman should desire to become a law
yer, and confident that thinking twice
she would rather become something
>lse. she has an intrinsic right to a fair
deal and for a sanctified band of her
jwn sex to ring in a cold deck is a blow
it an ideal which man in his oilndness
lias seen fit to set up.
Now that Theodore Durrant Is dead,
he bost hope is that he may be for
gotten, and yet the student of the ab
lormal must long speculate upon the
strange creature whose black and ap
palling record was Friday fitly ended
by the hangman. In form, but In
naught else, wa# Durrant human. He
could not be subject to the ordinary
which go to make up the span
jf life. Vain even on the gallons,
bestial, cruel, if there ever came to him
i regret for the girlÃ whom he had
<lain, it was because of the physical
discomfort the act brought upon him
self. And yet even for this the gl-jrv
of being heralded over the world as a
monster seemed to be an adequate off
set. No episodes in the history of re
volting crimes could be more terribie
than the murders he committed in the
house of God. No experience mortal
ever knew could surpass in agony the
experience which must have come to
the fair and helpless maidens when
there burst upon them the awful truth
that they were at the mercy of a
malign and pitiless demon. Compared
with the fate of Minnie Williamsâ her
anguish of soul, her bodily painâ the
death of Durrant was to be courted as
a luxurious exit. With a rope about
his neck he impressed a gaping throng
that he was brave. He simply lacked
conscience and heart. To lure a girl
to the shelter of a sacred fane and
there torture her life away requires
a sort of courage. Even led by pas
sion or anger to such a deed a man
would be driven to insanity by the hor
ror of it when the paroxysm had
passed. In every shadow he would
see the wraith of his victim. In every
breath of air there would be an accus
ing voice. Peace would have fled from
earth. Durrant had this peculiar cour
age. It sustained him on the scaffold,
as it had sustained him when the State
was weaving about him a web of cer
tain evidence, which enabled him to be,
flippant when the boasts of innocence
made by his counsel had been scat
tered by a storm of fact as chaff before
the wind. This courage did not mark
him as a man. The final display -.vas
the certificate he placed on the cer
tainty of his own guili.
As to the lawyers concerned in the
Durrant case I have already expressed
an opinion which there is no occasion
to revise nor reiterate at length. They
have brought reproach upon a profes
sion that should be honorable, and I
think they must share the guilt of Dur
rant since they tried to save him, out
raging the law and the people, after
guilt had become apparent to all men,
and when the blood of his dishonored
victims was crying from the ground.
Were their ears deafened by the clink
of coin, or did they simply strive to
show how potent the law could be in
defeating itself? As for the ministry,
that profession also seemed likely for a
time to suffer, but the only minister
found at fault was Davis of Oakland,
who could not reasonably be expected
to be found elsewhere.
Then there is yellow journalism
which has joyously succeeded in plas
tering itself with new odium, a fresh
coat over another of the same materi
al. But yellow journalism is not a pro
fession. It is a crime.
RABBIT TRACKS.
On hill an<i curve of wooded ground
The snows have fallen down:
The brooks, in icy armor bound.
Their plaining murmurs drown.
And thickly on the creek's white bed
The rabbit tracks are spread.
A h]ue-jay through the tree tops flies,
Blue-etched against the dun:
Above, In gray and slaty skies.
The crows pass one by one;
While whore the laet month leaves lie dead
Dim rabbit tracks are spread.
Across the sheeted meadows bare
The wild wind swings apace.
Sings eldrltch-Hke through frosty Rlr,
Dies out and leaves no trace;
And where its viewless wake has sped
Faint rabbit tracks are spread.
The trees In silent wonder standâ
The hickory and oak;
And morning mists about them band
In garb of purple smoke.
And thick where woodland paths have led
The rabbit tracks are spread.
And all about the fleecy snows,
The orchards and the lanes.
The prickly way of bleak hedge-rows.
The bridges and the drains â
Where'er the wraith of night has fled
The rabbit tracks are spread.

OUR FRUIT INDUSTRY MISREPRE
SENTED.
To the Editor of The Call: A bulletin
on fruit culture, of recent issue from the
Division of Pomology, United States De
partment of Agriculture, which has been
given wide publicity, contains numerous
unpardonable mistakes pertaining to the
horticultural industry of our State.
These blunders were recently pointed out
to the Secretary' of Agriculture by Sen
ator Stephen M. White.
To illustrate the absolute imbecility of
the document, it states, for instance,
that no oranges are raised in the State:
makes no mention of the production of
grapes south of latitude 39. that territory
embracing the Fresno region and other
large grape-growing sections. Figs are
not mentioned as a California product
nor are Japanese persimmons. No men
tion is made of raisins, nor is the State
credited with the ability to produce
walnuts, and very little notice is made
of many varieties of apples and peaches.
While the bulletin contains no nega
tions that California does not raise fruit
accredited to other States, it having been
given official indorsement and sent
broadcast over the world, purporting to
state the special localities devoted to the
raising of the particular fruits enumer
ated, no other interpretation can be
placed on the document than that Cali
fornia is not adapted to the production
of the fruits named.
In order to correct the false impres
sions that may arise from the inac
curacy of the aforesaid bulletin, the fol
lowing statistics of the acreage in fruit

= The men on board the North Bend
did not take the time to see what dam
age-their craft had sustained, as she
was rapidly drifting on Point Diablo.
. Everything possible was done to pre
vent the schooner from going ashore,
but without avail, and about 11:30 p. m.
on- the 7th inst. she struck heavily,
bow en. The tide soon swung her
around, and her starboard side came
against the rocky point. Captain
Bluhm ordered a turpentine danger
signal burned, and the Fort Point light
house responded. Word was sent to
the life saving stations, and two boats
were soon on the scene. Spreckels tow
boat office was also notified, and the
tug Vigilant was sent to tow the
stranded schooner off the rocks.

"/â¢inhere she was docked. While on the
, "rocks the schooner lost her keel, had
* several holes knocked in her bottom,
Jler starboard railing, and the rigging
rin the main and foremasts were cc-n
siderably-damaged, and the load of
lumber was the only thing that kept
the vessel afloat. As she now lies the
water is over her main deck, and as
soon as the deck load is removed she
will have to go on the mud flats to dis
charge thvremainder of her carp.i. The
schooner i.= strained in every seam, and
she will, have to receive a thorough ov

s decision is as follows:
This Is an examination into a charge
of criminal libel preferred by Claus
Spreckela apainst A. M. Lawn The
testimony showed and defendant admit-
U-ci that he was managing news editor
or the San Francisco Examiner June 7
JS'.w, the day the article complained of
appeared and had been for some months
prior thereto, and has been ever Binee
The article was offered and read !n evi
dence and is libeloua per se. It was a
clipping from an interior paper. The
defendant seeks to escape responsihil
it\ because he had employed a com
petent man. one C S. Aiken. to select
e;:rpir'ps from exchanges, and tha: he.
ccfti-dant, being absent the even- of
the publication at the theatei. did not
see the published article until some time
afteiward, and. therefore, is not charge
able with the publication thereof. The
defendant admits he had the power to
cn.p!cy and discharge Aiken and other
assistants on the Kxaminer. Do thÂ«so
circumstances excuse defendant and
render him guiltless of the crime of
libeling: Mr. Spreckels?
At the common law if a lib ", appeared
in a news-paper the proprietor, fie eli
tor and the printer and th â  publisher
were each liable, both civilly and crim
inally. All the text writers agree in this
See Townshend on Slander and Libel

157-294-325; Starkie on Slander. 225: New
ell on Defamation. 230-240-377,379.
To the same effect are all the English
decisions prior to the act of 6 and 7
Victoria. See Rex vs. Williams Lolft
759; Rex vs. "Walter. 3 Esp. 21; Rex.vs
Dt>dd, 2 Ses. Cas.^33; Rex vs. : -itch
1 11. & M.. 433.
By the act of. C and 7 Vie. the rule
was changed.
The common law rule has been pro
nounced the law in many of the States
of the Union. Sec Dunn vs. Hall 1
Ind., 344; Com. vs. Morgan. 107 Mass..
139;- Andres vs. Wells. 7 Johns (N. V.).
2UO; Buckley vs. Knapp, 4S Missouri, 152-
Com. vs. Mellin, a W. N. C. 433 (Pa.
(jr. Ses); State vs. Mason. 26 Oregon.
273. Unless, then, the statutes of this
State change the common, law rule the
defendant must, be held. The law re
garding criminal libel will be found fully
laid down in chapter 10 of title 8 of part
1 of the Penal' Code, sections 248 to 257,
Loth inclusive.
Section' 253" Penal Code is as follows,
viz:
"Each author, editor, and proprietor
of any bock, newspaper or serial publi
cation is chargeable with the publica
tion of any words contained in any part
of such book or number of such news
paper or serial." â  .
The English language does not contain
any words that could make the meaning
of this section plainer. It means just
what II says, viz: that each editor of a
newspaper is chargeable with the pub
lication of .any libel, appearing, in such
paper.-
The section simply enacts the com
mon law and does not weaken but
rather strengthens it. I will remark
that this section of the mi]. changed
sec. 120 of the old act concerning crimes
and punishments and made it." law
stronger in California. than before In
asmuch as the law was changed -by
the codes we must assume the Legisla
ture intended to change it, and to make
it plainer and stronger against the
libeler.
. It Is my duty to take the la-,- as I
find it. and. to enforce it as it is written.
The law makes the defendant guilty.
The contention of defendant that* a
malicious intent must be shown in rim
inal libel by, direct evidence of witnesses,
because of the language of section 249
Penal Code avails him nothing because
of the plain expression of section 250 of
the Penal Code, which reads as fol
lows: ;
"An Injurious publication Is presumed
to have been m'auclous if no justifiable
motive for making, it is shown." -
In .this case, we have: 1. A. most in
famous libel. 2. Its publication by de
fendant. 3. No justifiable motive for
its publication is shown or attempted
to be shown, wherefore the law says
such libel is presumed to have been
malicious.
- Our Penal Code defines what is mali
cious in subdivision 4 of section 7. which
reads thus: "The words 'malice' and
*m;ilic:ously' import a. wish *to vex.
anncy or injure another person or an
intent to do a wrongful act. established
either by proof or a presumption of
law."
Section 23) Penal Code, as we have
seen, establishes what is malice in crim
inal libel and thus furnishes what sec
tion 1 Fays is ail that is needed, viz:
"A presumption of law."
Independent of this cod>; provision it
is the rule In criminal proceedings for
libel that where the article is libel
ous per se â as In this caseâ it is not
necessary to prove express malice. See
State vs. Brady, 24 Pac. Rep.. 945. and
Haley vs. State. 63 Ala., S3. and 3 Green
leaf on Evi.'oncd, 61S. and State vs.
Mason, X Or.. 2T3. '
The case of State vs. Mason. 2* Or..
273. decided in November. 1!>34. is almost
identical with the one now before rife.
In that case thÂ»- same plea was made
by the defendant as is interposed here.
but the Supreme Court of Oregron in a.
very learned" and exhaustive â¢ decision.
written by Chi Justice Bean (one o'
the brightest log:; minds in ouNcoun
try). brushed is aside as founded neither
In law nor Justice. â¢ - â¢
In that case it was decided that
"Under a star providing that if any
person shall publish or cause to be pub
lished concerning another any false or
scandalous matter with Â»intent to in
jure or defame, he shall be punished,
etc., it is not necessary to constitute the
offense of libel that the publisher should
Have entertained a specific malicious in
tent to injure .and defame the prosecut
ing witness as the natural and probable
consequence of the publication i- to in
jure and defame, and the law will in
fer that the publisher intended the re
sults of his act."
Our Supreme Court In Taylor vs.
Hearst, 107jCal., 262, uses this language,
which is very apposite: ''Libel is a
false and unprivileged publication which
exposes any person to hatred, contempt,
ridicule or obloquy, or which causes him
to be shunned or. avoided, or which has
a tendency to injure him in his busi
ness, and hte proprietor of a newspaper
in which a libel is published, though he
had no knowledge of the publication at
the time, is as responsible for it as he
would have been if It hi <! been done
by him personally or under his direct
supervision." â ***?,*
Such should be the law. The pub
lisher or managing editor of a.news
paper should be made civilly and crim
inally responsible for libels appearing
therein. Otherwise the publisher and
editor could reside in New York and
publish* the worst libels against the best
citizens of California, and escape pun
ishment because they did not personally
see them before publication.

Answered.
The Prisoner's Farewell Letter
to Deuprey Received
Yesterday.
Arrangements for the Disposition of
the Bodyâ Rev. Dr. Racier 'a
Belief.
Out in the little cottape at 425 Fair
Oaks street, in the small parlor with
curtains closely drawn, lies all that is
mortal of William Henry Theodore
Durrant. In the back roosa Mrs. Dur
rant sat and wept all day. repeating
over and over again to herself, almost
as a sÂ«>rt of lullaby, the words. "Tbejr
succeeded in taking my i>oy away
from me. I hope they are happy at
last."
The father was calmer, and attend
ed to the minor details of the family
affairs as carefully as ever. The milk
man failed to stop at the house the
day before, realizing that nobody
would be there. l>ut JfÂ» tfininj the eld
er Durrant saw Policeman E. F. Bode
and had the regular supply of milk
'.eft as usual.
Nobody came and stood around the
to exhibit any morbid curiosity,
and but tew friends called to extend
their sympathy. Those who did were
received by a little old woman, who
carried all messages and closely bolted
the door as soon as she heard the
iforda, permitting no one to enter.
It is expected that the body of the
executed man will be cremated to-day
at OdÂ«i Fellows' Cemetery. A burial at
sea has received some consideration.
Guard Arbogast, one of the death
watch, was in this city yesterday. He
says he heard everything that passed
between Father Lagan and Durrant
at the time he was received into the
Catholic faith, and that the prisoner,
when questioned, firmly denied his
guilt. ,
Rev. Dr. Rader has also expressed
his belief in the fact that Durrant
committed the murders attributed to
him, and admits that he has been of
that opinion ever since he interviewed
Durrant in his cell. He thinks Dur
rant knew his opinion on account of
the irritable attitude assumed by the
r toward him.
Attorney Deuprey received a letter
from Dun-ant yesterday, . which had
been intrusted to the care of Attorney
C W. Smythe, one of the friends Dur
rant named to be present at the exe
cution. The lawyer also brought, let
ters for General Dickinson and Attor
ney Koardman, both of whom are ab
sent from the city. Deuprey's letter
reads as follows:
E. N. Deuprey Esq.â Dear Friend:
I cannot write you as I feel. You have
done nobly, and in the true sense of the
word have gained a victory even in the
light of circumstances. The victory is
really ours. We have proven innocence,
and our name and family shall for all
time to come be looked upon with respect
by more than the thousands who now
respect and believe in us. This must
grow, and nothing must prevent it. Re
member, there are no sensations, confes
sions or stories. If such appear as hav
ing emanated from here or the guards,
etc., I deny them, because I have seen
no one. I also have their signed state
ment to that effect, which I shall give to
mother.
Mr. Deuprey. you know I am innocent
and free from any crime as accused. But
it is ail past now, and quietness for the
time must reign, for the noble mother,
father and sister need rest and peace.
Let the name remain honored just as it
is and help to sustain it always. â¢
Now 1 must go, so not good-by. but au
revoir. THEO.
The Durrants have ascertained that
while the Catholic church, as a church,
is : not in favor of cremation, yet it is
not- absolutely prohibited. Therefore
they telegraphed ..; late last evening to
the Los Angeles Crematory asking if.
the body could be cremated there. At
a late hour no reply had been received.
It is the parents' intention to carry out
the wish of the executed man in this
respect if it can be done. As no burial
permit has yet been procured from the
Board of Health, although this will be
forthcoming at any time, it is entirely
probable that ; wheter the body is cre
mated or" buried 4it will not be disposed
of until to-morrow.

MOONLIGHT IN
SUNSET VALLEY
A. Section of the City Where
Candles and Coal Oil
Are Luxuries.
Night Visiting Between Neighbors
Only When Nature Dispels
Darkness.
Moonlight to the residents of Sun
set Valley is as welcome as is sunshine
to the residents of the Klondike at
this season of the year.
The reason for this condition of af
fairs is that the people living in the
Sunset Valley although belonging to
the municipality of San Francisco are
as devoid of artificial lights as if the
section was 100 miles distant from any
.ivilized .community. As a result of
this condition neighbors never think
of making visits after sundown unless
they provide themselves with a dark
lantern.
Strange as it may seem, it Is a fact
that there are no gas or electric lights
provided for the residents of the Sun
set Valley. The lamps nearest the val
ley are fully a mile distant, at the cor
ner of Carl and Stanyan streets, and
from this place out to the ocean there
is not a glimmer of artificial light save
what is produced by either candle or
coal oil within the houses in the dis
trict. The "generous" gas and elec
tric light company has time and again
made fair promises to run an electric
wire into the dismal valley of dark
ness, but, alas, corporation promises
and corporation conscience seem about
on a par in this respect.
The Supervisors, to whom the tax
payers rightly look foT relief, have been
equally profuse in their promises, but
with a similar result.
It is only within the past few months
that the great municipality of the
Queen City of the Pacific took steps
to even put in a sewer for the use of
the people, and even this would not
have been done had it not been for the
interference of the health department
of the city. As to a water supply" the
residents simply dig wells in their
back yards and pump what is neces
sary for the family use. But with the
water company there is an excuse on
the ground that the streets are not laid
out or graded, and until this is done it
would be unfair to expect the compa
ny to put in mains. No such excuse
can be advanced on the part of the gas
and electric light company, so the
property owners say, from the fact
that wires can be strung over sand
hills, streets or no streets.
At a recent meeting of the Sunset
Improvement Club strong and stinging
resolutions were passed on the desid
erata here enumerated, as also that of
providing the section with a .chemical
engine for the protection of the homes
of the pe<-ple.
The following petition was ordered
by the club, to be forwarded to the Su
pervisors:
To the Honorable thfÂ» Board of Super
visors of trio City and t'ounty of San
Francisco â Gentlemen: We, the under
signed executive committee of the Sun
set District Improvement f'Uib. by order
of saM club and on behalf of the resi
dents and property-owners of Sunset Dis
trict, apain most respectfully petition
your honorable board to pive us light in
bur district. Although we have repeat
edly petitioned the Board of Supervisors
we have been left in utter darkness
nightly up to the present time.
While wp have been helping to pay for
other parts of the city to be brilliantly
lighted, we have groped along our streets
in darkness to the danger of life and
urob.
W e most earnestly urge your honora
ble body to afford us some relief by
placing lights at the points herein named
and we ask you to consider that the loss
of one life may be worth more than the
paltry sum to be expended in one dis
trict, and that it is disgraceful on the
part of the city to leave a well built-up
and inhabited portion of San Francisco
without any lights the whole year.
It is in your power as Supervisors, and
it is your duty to us as taxpayers, to
make the li.arht monopoly obey your or
ders as long as you do not increase the
number of lights. Respectfully yours,
Edward Ewald, Daniel Foley, Julius
Frankel, Frank Conklin, R. Keller.

HOW TO BE HAPPY THOUGH MARRIED,
Many an otherwise happy home and loving

WHY NOT APPLY TO YOUR LIFE.
Think it over carefully. Look at the happy,

ENGLAND'S
ACTIVITY IN
THE SOUDAN
\m mense Supplies Are
Forwarded to the
Front.
Triumph in Africa May
Offset the Blunders
in India.
So Ministers Desire to Meet Par
liament With Khartoum
In Their Hands.
ANGLO-EGYPTIAN FORCE.
Jt Consists of 18,000 Egyptians, Thirty
Battalions of British Troops and
Nile Gunboats.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Jan. B.â The official state
ment that the military tactics in Egypt
are purely defensive is not credited.
The greatest activity is manifested in
all quarters. Immense supplies of am
munition and food are being forward
ed to the front, and it is whispered in
military circles that the ministers de
sire to meet Parliament with Khar
toum in their hands, so that a triumph
in Africa may offset the blunders in
India. Even with the liveliest efforts,
however, the time intervening will
hardly suffice for a coup in the Soudan.
The Anglo-Egyptian force consists of
IS, OOO Egyptians, thirty battalions erf
British troops and the Nile gunboats,
all commanded by Sir Herbert Kitche
nor. The latter refuses to allow the
â¢war correspondents to go beyond the
head of the railway.
A letter has been received from a
British officer serving in the Soudan,
who says that since July the Dervishes
have killed more than 2000 of the Jaalin
tribe, and he adds that the women and
children who are homeless and starv
ing number 5000 souls.
The Statist expresses the opinion that
the fart that a resolution has been in
troduced in Congress to pay the inter
est on the United States debt either In
gold or silver indicates that there is
little chance of any reform of the. cur
rency by the present Congress, "in
6pite of Secretary Gage's confidence";
and regrets that under the cir
cumstances it is c-bliged to continue
cautioning Britishers against investing
In America until the currency question
is settled. The Statist further says:
"Under ordinary circumstances we
should like much of our invest
ed in the United States, where a ma
jority of the citizens are of our kin and
whom we desire to see prosperous."
The Statist admits that the present
prosperity in the United States wo\ild
warrant large investments, "but for the
silver nightmare, which is ever threat
ening," concluding: "The present
prices are so tempting that it is much
to be regretted that there is no definite
prospect that Congress will take effect
ive steps to allay the fears."
The Parnellites will introduce their
customary amnesty amendment to the
Queen's speech at the opening of Par
liament.
The Gazette of Wednesday notified
the public of the naturalization of Pro
fessor Hubert Herkomer, R. A., and
A!ma Tadema, R. A. Incidentally It
says that Herkomer's nationality is un
known.
The case of Mrs. Florence Mayfcrick
â¢will perhaps be reopened shortly in an
other form. Important evidence in fa
vor of Mrs. Edith May Carew has been
discovered and an infiuentially signed
petition to the Queen asking for Her
retrial in England is preparing.
The Swedes seem inclined to take ad
\-antage of Russian preoccupation in
the far east to reopen hostilities with
Jsorway. When the relations between
the two countries were strained in 1896
It became evident that Russia was in
clined to aid Norway, in exchange for
the cession of Finmark, including the
port of Hammerfest.
The appointment of ex-King Milan
as commander-in-chief of the Servian
army has caused a sensation. In well
informed circles the opinion is ex
pressed that the appointment was ne
cessary, as the Servian army, which
has great admiration for the former
King, is assuming an independent at
titude. Th<> Government b3lieves that
Milan win be able to calm the disaf
fection, but the course of affairs in
Servia indicates that King Alexander
may ere long retire in favor of his
father. It la said King Alexander has
an unconquerable aversion to wedlock
but on the other hand it is stated that
ex-King Milan will soon marry again
A music-hall singer, who sold letters

The refusal of the Secretary of State

of the pending Presidential election in
the Transvaal. This afternoon the pa
pers print an apparently Inspired ex

a month old and that President Kru
grer gives it out now as a campaign

describing it as a reassertion of Mr'

NAVAL PLAN
IMPROVING
There Are Now Better
Chances for the
Bill.
Support for the Measure
Secured in the
Reichstag.
Prospects of a Split Which Will
Insure the Emperor His
Big Navy
DIPLOMATS EXPECT STRIFE
Predict a Conflict Between France
and England in the Race to
Khartoum.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BERLIN, Jan. B.â The Reichstag will
reassemble on Tuesday and the budget
committee will forthwith begin its de
liberations. The chances of the naval
bill are materially improved. The Con
servatives, with the exception of the
Agrarian wing, the National Liberals
and a fraction of the Radicals, now
generally favor the measure, while 'a
split among the Centrists is now in
process of formation. The Prussian
members, under the leadership of Herr
Leiber, are inclined to vote for the bill,
with certain amendments. On the
other hand, the South Germans, espec
ially the Bavarians, are unalterably op
posed to it.
If the split is effected, Emperor Wil
liam will have his big navy, and the
Centrists, the more powerful opposition
to the Government, and against whose
wishes no measure could hitherto be
passed in the Reichstag, will cease to
be a unit, and a new party grouping is
necessitated which will materially af
fect the quinquennial elections in the
spring, for the new attitude of the
Center will influence the higher Catho
lic clergy, especially Archbishop
Stablewski and Prince Bishop Kopp.
Yielding to the wishes of the Vatican,
they are largely responsible for the
series of important demonstrations pre
paring in favor of the naval increase.
The first will take place in Berlin on
January 13, when 250 heads of leading
German Industrial and manufacturing
establishments and banks will convene.
If the Emperor and the Government
, are willing to accept certain amend
ments, notably in regard to the septen
nate feature, the measure can be pass
| ed by the present Reichstag, though
there will probably be a very clost
i vote.
From a gentleman of the immediate
entourage of the Emperor a corre
spondent learns that both Emperor
William and Prince Henry's sensa
tional speeches at Kiel were wholly
extemporaneous. Prince Henry was
taken wholly by surprise, and, being
quite unused to public speaking, deliv
er. â¢>< his remarks in a manner which he
would not himself have approved if
they had been submitted to him prev
iously in wrll ig. No control, how
ever, being possible, owing to the cir
cumstances, the speech went forth to
the world, to his and to his majesty'b
chagrin.
In this connection the same author
i ity contradicts the often published
statement that every- word the Em
! peror utters in public is carefully writ
, ten and approved. On the contrary, it
i appears, his majesty seldom prepares
! his remarks, and they are mostly im
| promptu and delivered on the inspira
tion of the moment. This is true in
regard to all the Emperor's sensational
i and officially quoted speeches.
The following has been culled from
books in the court marshal's office :
! The Emperor in 1897 visited ninety
i places, traveling about 34,700 kilome
ters. He went eight times to Kiel.
i showing his anxiety regarding naval
i matters, besides going to the harbors
of Stettin. Dantzic, Bremen, Hamburg,
Altona, Elbing. Cuxhaven, Heligoland
j and Brunsbuettel. His Majesty spent
I fifty-seven days in hunting, killing
8354 large and small head of game. He
spent nine days in his trip to St. Pe
tersburg, ten in his trip to Hungary
; and twenty-six on his northern trip. In
addition to visiting the flood districts
of Silesia, his Majesty attended five un
veilings, six dedications of churches
| and seven other public ceremonies out
! side of Berlin.
The diplomats of Berlin expect seri
ous trouble between France and Great
1 Britain as the outcome of the race to
I Khartoum. They say that if France
j arrives there first there is bound to be
! war, as Great Britain could not sub
i mit to it, as Lower Egypt is valueless
I without this key of Inner Africa.
It Is learned from a member of the
ex-Chancellor's household that Prince
Bismarck was much shocked and an
noyed by the recent reports of his
death. Hitherto the Prince has smiled
at such canards and has made sar
castic comments. But when his son,
<"ount William Bismarck, told him
last Saturday of the reports then cur
rent, saying, "Father, they have again
reported you dead in Berlin." the aged
statesman's face clouded and he did
not reply.
At the Conservative National election
at Dresden on February 2 the plan for
the spring elections will be decided
upon.
The Kreuz Zeitung, reproducing al
leged abusive articles from the Ameri
can papers, remarks: "It is not wise to
handle these overbearing Yankees too
softly." Continuing the paper calls on
the Covernment to fight the United
States tariff "tooth for tooth," and to
prohibit the importation of American
meats and cereals.
The United States Embassador. An

largely attended. Princess Frederick

THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, SUNDAY,
WON A BRIDE BY
HYPNOTIC POWER
IN TWO HOURS.
Now Jan)es Carraway, Ooce a
Poor Printer of fltlanta,
Is the Envy of fill
His Fellows.
NEW YORK, Jan. Bâ A Herald special from Atlanta, Ga., says:
James Carraway, of this city, until a few months ago a poor printer,
and now known to theater-goers of the South as "Professor" Carra
way, the "White Mahatma," arrived in this city to-day with a bride,
who is introduced as Mrs. Carraway, formerly Tilly Meyer, daughter of
Charles Meyer, a New York millionaire. The announcement of his
marriage to her created a Bensation in Atlanta, and expensive apart
ments engaged in the Hotel Aragon served to intensify the envy of his
former associates at his marvelous fortune.
The nuptials were celebrated ten days ago at St. Augustine, Fla. The
announcement was not made, however, until the couple reached this
city. Carraway was filling an engagement in St. Augustine about three
weeks ago, giving exhibitions of his powers as a hypnotist and mind
reader. He was stopping at the Alcazar, the best hotel then open in
the city. He was introduced to Miss Meyer, and after an acquaintance
of two hours they became engaged. He left the next afternoon for Sa
vannah.
After filling an engagement in that city, he filled one in Charleston
and hurried back to St. Augustine, where he and Miss Meyer were
married.
The bridal couple remained in St. Augustine for several days and
then came to Atlanta, where the young husband introduced his bride to
his parents for the first time.
"I suppose our marriage was a little sudden," said Carraway to
night, "but we were in love with each other, and there was no reason
why we should not marry at once. My wife interposed no objections,
and we did not desire to wait. She had gone to Florida for the benefit
of her health and was alone, but was expecting her parents to join her
soon."
Mr?. Carraway is an only child. Her father is now at Huntington,
L. 1., at his country residence, though he has been at his home in New
York until a recent attack of illness. He is a large property owner and
Is a member of the Ringler Brewery concern. In addition to this he
owns a great deal of real estate outside of New York and is credited
with being worth $3,000,000.
"My wife is strongly opposed to my continuing on stage work, and
I do not know yet just what I shall do about it."
When asked if his bride had become interested in his work, he said,
"No, indeed. I do not even know whether or not she believes In hyp
notism or mind reading. I have never asked her about the matter at
all. We simply fell in love with each other at first sight."
Mrs. Carraway is 24 years of age and a blonde, and there is a strong
belief among Carraway's associates that she has been hypnotized.
JACKSON DAY
CELEBRATED
Leading Democrats At
tend a Banquet at
Chicago.
Again the Boy Orator of Ne
braska Talks About Free
Silver.
Argues That Prosperity Has Not Been
Restored by Opening Mills In
stead of Mints.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Jan. B.â A host of Demo
crats, quite a number of them from
lowa, Indiana and Wisconsin, cele
brated Jackson day by a banquet at
the Tremont House this evening. W.
J. Bryan was the principal guest. He
arrived from Lincoln this morning, be
ing met at the depot by National Corn
mitteeman Gahan and others selected
to welcome him. For an hour or so
prior to the feast, Mr. Bryan held a
reception In the hotel parlors and shook
hands with a large number of callers.
Nearly 500 were seated at the banquet.
Mayor Harrison presided and acted as
toastmaster.
Mr. Bryan was received with cheers
when introduced. He again went over
his free-silver argument and concluded
as follows:
Twelve months have elapsed since Â«c
celebrated 1 this day a year ago, and every
month has borne witness to the failure of
Republican policies to bring relief to the
people. Just after the passage of the
Dingley bill our opponents were boister
ous in their announcement that prosper
ity had returned. The Republicans were
given full swing. They framed just such
a law as their hearts desired and their
brains devised, and what is the result?
Read the daily papers and you will find
the items of news arranged under two
headsâ the formation of trusts and the
reduction of wages. few days ago I
picked up a copy of the St. Louis Globe-
Democrat and found under the innocent
and unpretentious headlines, "Weavers
and Spinners," seven notices of wage re
ductions from four of the six New Eng
land Statesâ one of them from Lewis
ton, Me., the home of Mr. Dingley, the
father of the Dingley bill.
Is this the result which they promised
would follow the opening of the mills in
stead of the mints? If our enemies boast
that they have buried bimetallism, we
point to the.sfc wage reductions as the
weeping willows which have sprung up
about its temporary tomb. Why is not
some court asked to enjoin the employers
from uniting together to reduce wages?
Can combinations among employers be
innocent if co-operation among miners
is a crime? In most of the factories can
be found transparencies and banners
promising good times. The mill owners
would probably dispute the right of a
court of equity to interfere and plead as
a defense that the operatives have an
adequate remedy In the ballot.
Since the last celebration of Jackson
day thouands of political prodigals have
returned to the old home and thousands
more are growing weary of the husks.
There is no humiliation in the acknowl
edgment of error. To a portion of our
people the money question was a new
question in 1896, and as we demanded af
firmative action the timid and only half
convinced arrayed themselves against us.
Since the election there has been time for
further study, and events in rapid suc
cession have been vindicating the position
taken by the bimetallic forces in the last
campaign. The Republicans, too. Intoxi
cated by success, have been disclosing
schemes which were carefully concealed
during the contest. We may, therefore,
expect continuous accessions to our
ranks.
Bryan then urged the necessity of
extending and perfecting the work of
the Democratic clubs, closing with the
words: "I will, therefore, bid you be
of good cheer. Unless all political
omens fail the twentieth century will
open with the money of the constitu
tion restored and the motto 'Equal
rights to all and special privileges to
none,' the controlling principle in all
the departments of the Government.
Then will our people sing a new song
of a nation redeemed "

LIVES LOST IN
A COAL MINE
Explosion of Gas Causes
the Death of Sev
eral Men.
Had the Disaster Occurred
Later the Fatalities Would
Have B'-en Greater.
SornÂ« of thÂ« Delvera Who Were
Worki.-g at 'he Time Managed
to Escape.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PITTSBURG. Kan., Jan. B.â Several
lives are supposed to have been lost by
an explosion, probably of dust or gas,
at 6:40 o'clock this evening in shaft 5
of the Mount Carmel Coal Company's
mine, six and a half miles south of
here, near C'hicopee.
The explosion occurred at shot-firing:
time, when, so far as known, but seven
or eight men were in the shaft, five of
these being shot-firers and the others
drivers. Had the accident occurred a
half hour later the forty men of the
night shift would have been caught.
The explosion, which was accom
panied by a loud report, wrecked the
blacksmith shop and other buildings at
the surface and started a fire In the
timbering. However, the pumps were
started and the fire extinguished.
Twenty minutes after the explosion
two men â Booth Boyd and Jesse Sher
rardâescaped from the smoking shaft
by climbing up the frame work. They
could give no account of the explosion.
They were In the mule stables, they
said, when the explosion occurred,
and climbed out as soon as they could
rearh the shaft.
The men who remained in the mine
and were believed to be dead were: Joe
Setar, Jim Simmonman, John Bossin,
Anton Welmberger, Anton Gorwitz and
Casper Bartolta.
The explosion caused the greatest
excitement in the little town of Chico
pee, as It was feared at first that all
the men of the night shift were caught
in the mine. The loss to the company
will be heavy. The mine employs 200
men on the day shift.
At midnight the rescue party had
reached four of the -entombed men.
None of them had been seriously In
jured, and the starting of the fans
soon after the explosion had prevented
suffocation. Bossin and Weimberger
had not been reached at midnight. The
explosion was hoard and felt in this
city, over six miles away.
AN ADVERTISING SWINDLER
CAUGHT AT BAKERSFIELD
Forges a Number of Checks About Town,
and Attempts to Leave on a Train
for the North.
BAKERSFIEKD, Jan. B.â A young
man signing himself Charles A. Owens
on the hotel register arrived in town
this morning and visited the local pa
pers and entered into a contract with
them to advertise the mercantile busi
ness of "Bush, Harman & Co." and
"A. H. Bush & C 0.," alleged firms of
Lob Angeles. He was very smooth and
suave in his manner.
Early this evening it was discovered
that he had forgâ¬ d a number of checks
around town for small amounts and
then disappeared. An hour later he
was caught trying to leave on the
early train for the north. Ho was
locked up. He is about 30 years of
age, tall and dark-complexioned. He
signed his name to one of the ad con

LOS ANGELES. Jan. B.â lt was a day
of almost continuous swearing at the
rooms of the Board of Education to
day, and the greater portion of it was
done by lady teachers. They were In
stigated and abetted in their course by
the secretary of the board. H. G. John
son. More than four hundred teachers
and employes of the School Department
swore to and filed their affidavits with
the secretary. These depositions are
to be put in evidence Monday as part
of the defense of Walter L. Webb, who
Is being investigated by the Board of
Education on a charge of having re
ceived bribes from teacners and em
ployes. He has already been acquitted
of a similar charge before the Superior
Court. Some rather sensational and
unexpected matters were embodied in
these documents. The affidavits con
sisted of a series of nine interrogatories
prepared by the defense. They were
sent to each teacher and employe of
the department with the request that
they be filled out, sworn to before the
secretary and filed to-day. When the
office of the secretary was closed to
day there yet remained about one hun
dred affidavits to be filed. Most of
these are expected to be in by Monday
evening. Those who fail to make affi
davit will be called to the witness
stand before the board to give their
testimony orally.
Nothing new has developed in the
line of bribe-taking or negotiations
with bribery in view, but interrogatory
No. 8 brought forth one sensational bit
of evidence, much that was interesting
and some that was amusing under the
circumstances. This question is as fol
lows:
"Have you ever had any business re
lations or transactions of any kind or
character whatsoever with any mem
ber of the board?"
Some told of being treated by Dr.
Matthis for their health, some had gone
to C. C. Davis for legal advice, others
had purchased stationery or had cards
engraved at Webb's; a few had pur
chased pianos of Bartlett, some as far
back as ISB7, or 10 cent or 25 cent ar
ticles of the same director: some had
boarded at Mr. Poor's: a plumber had
worked at the house of Mclnerney, but
had been paid by the School Director
from his own private purse, and a car
penter had been employed by Mclner
ney privately.
Mrs. Emma Thurston, the principal
of the Custer Street School, contributes
some testimony that will probably give
Director Braly and his newspaper de
fenders at least a bad quarter of an
hour.
This was her reply to interrogatory
No. 8: "Cashed my November warrant
at Mr. Braly's bank."
The warrants of the teachers engaged
bl the primary and grammar schools j
are paid out of the county school fund
and are then kept on file at the County
Auditor's office. A careful search of
the paid warrants for November failed
to discover that of Mrs. Thurston, but j
it resulted in turning up that of George I
E. Roedipg for $13 40, which had been
assigned to the Southern California '
Savings Bank, of which Braly is presi- j
dent. The assignment of the claim is |
without date, but the warrant was is- !
sued and paid on November 6, 1897. I
Although assigned to the Southern
California Savings Bank, the warrant
bears the indorsement on its back of H. i
G. Bundrema, son-in-law of Mr. Braly. '
In this transaction Braly involved him
self in a criminal act that is described
â ad made punishable by the laws of i
the State as a felony, and his bank In
an act that makes it liable to lose its

franchise. The same Infractions of the
law have been committed by Braly and
his bank as they had committed in the
matter of the warrant of Miss M. E.
O'Brien.
A further investigation of this mat
ter showed that Mr. Roeding is the
manager of the Fancher Creek Nur
sery of Fresno, and that he had soid
to the school department on the unau
thorized order of J. H. Braly umbrella
trees for planting about the schools of
the Fifth Ward, which is represented
in the board by Mr. Braly. This claim
caused a bitter fight in the School
Board, but was finally allowed, as a
matter of justice to Roeding. Braly
then bought the Roeding claim. Mrs.
Thurston's unpaid warrant was found
in the hands of the auditor. It has not
yet been claimed by the Southern Cal
ifornia Savings Bank.
Braly is the member of the Board of
Education whom the Times says has
been by The Call stigmatized in a most
uncomplimentary manner, whose bus
iness has been by The Call referred
to after a fashion that "may be libel
ous" and "against whom no charges
have been found." In view of the
manner in which the Times has come
to Braly's defense the question that is
now being asked in Los Angeles is,
"How much have J. H. Braly and his
anoymous backers paid for the serv
ices of their Los Angeles organ?"

PARIS, Jan. B.â A girl named Decousset
waylaid a clerk named Verdier to-day,
threw vitriol in his face and stabbed him
in the back. Verdier shot her with a
revolver as she was running: away. He
then knelt on her head and shot her
three times, killing her. He was arrested
and taken to the nearest hospital, where
he was found to be terribly burned. Ver
dier said the woman had followed him for
a year, attempting to kill him.
UNREQUITED LOVE
AND A REVOLVER
Tragic End of a Romance at
the Town of Valley
Ford.
Jilted byHis S-weetheart, a Prosperous
Young Swiss Fatally Shoots
Himself.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, Jan. B.â From the lit
tle town of Valley Ford on the bound
ary line between Marin and Sonoma
Counties comes a story of attempted
suicide and behind it the tale of an un
requited love of great interest.
This morning, according to the mea
ger accounts that have found their way
to San Rafael, James Sardelotti, aji
honest, hard-working Swiss, made a
desperate attempt to blow h's bra.ins
out with a revolver near the great
creamery where he had employment.
He was found by, a ranch hand lying
in a pool of his own blood, unconscious
and with the crimson fluid oozing from
a wound in his right temple.
Helping hands soon arrived, and
shortly after Sardelotti recovered con
sciousness and gazed about him in sur
prise. "When he recovered sufficiently
to tell of his deed he said that he had a
pistol in his hand and had stumbled
and that as he fell the pistol was dis
charged and the bullet had struck him.
After that he remembered nothing. To
day the man is lying at the point of
death and the doctors hold out no
hopes of recovery.
The story told by the wounded man
is not believed, for it is said that he has
been despondent over a love affair. Sar
delotti holds notes and other securities
for a large sum, in the thousands, ac
cording to some of those who were in
timate with him at Valley Ford. His
wealth Is given as at least $10,000, the
earnings of a lifetime, and with this
sum he wished to buy a home and wed
a sweetheart he left years ago in Swit
zerland.
Only recently have the dreams of his
youth been within his reach and he
wrote in endearing terms to the maiden
who had grown to womanhood and be
sought her to journey across the waters
and become his wife. There came no
reply to his entreaties and he waited
day after day, week after week, and
still the mail brought no letter to cheer
him. Again and again he wrote, and
as the months rolled by and no answer
arrived, Sardelotti grew despondent,
and to-day he sought to end his exist
ence.
Dr. Bruce of Bloomfleld was sent for
and treated the wounded man. At a
late hour the information was gi%*en
out that Sardelotti could not recover,
for the wound was in a vital spot and
the end might come at any time.
FRESNO TRUSTEES IN A QUANDARY.
Afraid to Turn the Fire Department Over to
Democratic Heelers.
FRESNO, Jan. B.â The Board of City
Trustees is now hesitating about carry
ing out Its original intention of disrupt
ing the volunteer fire department and
putting In an aggregation of Democratic
ward strikers, who have organized them
selves into a so-called fire department
and petitioned the Trustees to recognize
them as the city fire department.
The petition came ui> this evening for
further consideration, but no action was
taken? The better part of public senti
n ent I* strongly against such raw poli
tical work and the Trustees recognize
tluft they will lie severely censured if
they lendVerr.selves to the jobbery. They"
laid the petition over for the time be
ng on the ground that the new compa
re ies were not formed^ according to law.

ABOUT STUART'S DYSPEPSIA
TABLETS.
They Cure Stomach Troubles and Indi-
gestion Anyway, Whether You Havo
Faith in Them or Not.
All physicians agree that the ele-
ment of faith has a great deal to to
in the cure c-f disease. '
Firm belief and confidence in a fam-
ily physician or the same confidence
and faith in a patent medicine have
produced remarkable cures in all ages.
This is especially true in nervous
troubles, and no field offers so prolific
a harvest for the quack and charlatan
as the diseases arising from a weak
or run down nervous system. - : v '"",,
Nevertheless, the most common of all
diseases, indigestion and stomach trou-
bles, which in turn cause nervous dis-
eases, heart troubles, comsumption and
; loss of flesh, requires something be-
sides faith to cure.
Mere faith will not digest your food
for you, will not give you an appetite,
will not increase your flesh and
strengthen your nerves and heart, but
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets will d(>
these things, because they are com-" 5 *
posed of the elements of digestion;
they contain the juices, acids and pep-
tones necessary to the digestion ana
assimilation of all wholesome food.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets will di-
gest food if placed in a jar or bottle
in water heated to 98 degrees, and they
will do it much more effectively when
taken into the stomach after meals,
whether you have faith that they will
or not.
They invigorate the stomach, make
pure blood and strong nerves, in the
only way that nature can do it, and
that is. from plenty of wholesome food
well digested. It is not what we eat
but what we digest that does us good.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are sold
by druggists at 50 cents for full-sized
package.

Free samples of a most remarkable
' remedy are being distributed by the State

' suffering of lost manhood that the insti-

i any form of sexual weakness resulting
from youthful folly, premature loss oc

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 9, IS9B.
CHINESE SLATE
GIRLS IN PORT
The Scare Among the
Importers Is Over and
They Come Again.
Evidence Against the Dealers
to Be Presented to the
Collector.
A Cigar Manufacturer on Stockton
Street Said to Head the
Gang.
The scare received by the importers
of Chinese slave girls some months ago,
when their methods were thoroughly
ventilated through the columns of The
Call, seems to have subsided, for the
wily Mongolians are auuin at work at
tempting to evade the law.
There are now on various steamers in
port from the Orient, ten or a dozen
Chinese girls who are awaiting an op
portunity to get ashore. These girls
were brought over from China, osten
sibly as the wives or daughters of mer-
chants residing here, or as native
daughters. As usual each one was
thoroughly coached before leaving
China as to what to say regarding her
birth, and were it not for the fact that
ometimes Chinese memories are not
perfect the girls would have no trouble
to get ashote, but there is such a dis-
crepancy between the stories told by
the girls and the witnesses through
whose help they are landed that the
collector of the port has his suspicions
aroused and places obstacles in the
way of successful consummation of the
scheme.
The girls ln port at present, or at
least four of them, have been brought
over by a man who runs a cigar manu
factory on Stockton street, between
Jackson and Pacific streets. This man
disclaims any ownership in the girl*,
but those who are in a position to
know say that he is at the head of an
association which deals in slave girls,
and that since the subsidence of the
scare he has been especially active.
The association has ramifications in
all the coast cities, and it is claimed
that the recent persecution of Dr.
Gardner, the official interpreter, was a
part uf the scheme, as he was In the
way, and it y\~ mainly through his
efforts that the scnemers were put to
trouble in getting the girls ashore.
They thought that if they could k- t
him convicted of accepting bribes they
would get him out of the way and have
a clear field. The ease with which Dr.
Gardner cleared himself of all taint
surprised them and then they tried
various devices to get him out of the
city until they could get the present
batch of girls ashore.
His return last week upset their plans
and now the slave dealers are casting
about for ways to again get him out
of the way as the collector will not
wait much longer bef6re he orders all
the girls sent back as he did the one
last Wednesday.
The Stockton street man, who is said
to be the head of the importers, denies
any complicity in the matter,, and,
strange to say, his name was not
known to the officials of the Chinese
bureau of the custom house. Chinese
who are well acquainted with the man
and the workings of the association,
however, say that the man is the real
head of the importing company and
that it was through his advice that the
letter was Bent to China some months
ago telling that end of the association
to send no more girls until the talk had
ceased.
Those who are opposed to the landing
of the girls are at work gathering evi
dence against them and will present it
to the collector in a few days and ex
pert to have all the girls sent back to
China. They will also present a mem
orial to Collector Jackson asking him
to take measures to have stricter watch
kept on the imported girls so that they
may not be approached by the Chinese
until after they have been thoroughly
examined by the officials of the depart
ment.
BENJAMIN F. BERGEN.
Judge B. F. Bergln of Berkeley was yesterday commissioned by Gover
nor Budd a director of the State Deaf, Dumb and Blind Asylum. Mr. Ber
gin has resided in Berkeley for many years, during which time he has
acted as a member of the Board of Education. In ISBS President Cleve
land appointed him special examiner of land titles for the Interior De
partment, which position h-Â» held until ISB9, when he resigned to take up
the practice of law In this city. In 1894 he was the regular Democratic
nominee for Superior Judge In Alameda County, and although running far
ahead of his ticket, was defeated. He Is now acting as special United
States Attorney, having been retained by the Government to protect Its
interest in large bodies of lands situated in California,
RULES FOR THE
POLICE COURTS
Important Suggestions Of
fered at a Meeting of
the Judges.
Assignment of Cases to Be
Taken From the Police
Department.
Orders of Discharge to Be Given Only
by the Trial Judge Who Will
Accept the Bond*.
The Police Court Judges met yester
day afternoon In Judge Joaohlmsen's
chambers to formulate a set of rules
on the rame principle as the Superior
Court Judges. The prosecuting attor
neys of the courts hsid also been in
vited to be present. The only absentees
were Judge Conlan and his prosecuting
attorney, Mogan. Judge Conlan tele
phoned that he would be unable to be
present as he was very busy otherwise,
but no excuse was received from Mo
gan.
Judge Campbell, as presiding Judge,
was called to take the chair and How
ard Vernon Jr. was appointed clerk
of the meeting.
A number of important suggestions
were made, among thÂ«-m those referred
to in Fridays Call, and it was decided
to think them over and meet again to
morrow afternoon to finally act upon
them.
One of the most important is that the
casts be equally divided among the
four departments whether the arrests
are made by warrant or not, upon the
order of the presiding Judge. The
clerks of the four courts will alternate
in the work "f assigning the cases. This
would take the assignment of the cases
out of tht; hands of the Police Depart
ment, that duty having hitherto been
nned by Sergeant McDonald, who
has charge of the Police Court records.
Following upon the trouble between
Judges Low and Campbell ln regard
to th>e Sidney Kellett case no order .Â«f
discharge will in the future be given
by a Ju'lcre in a case in any other couit
than his own, and after a case has been
_:ied no â¢ bond can be accepted in
any case unless an order fixing bail 13
made in writing by the Judge of the
court in which the case is.
No extension of time will be gran:ei
to file a bill of exceptions on a state
ment on appeal except upon an arfi
davit showing good cause therefor a;vl
upon the order of tho trial Judge, cx
n > ase of absence from, the city or
sickness.
The Judge having the disposition ol
the "drunks" will remain in his court
or chambers frum 9 a. m. till 5 p. m.
each day, Sundays excepted, along
with his warrant clerk so as to attend to
any business after the othercourts have
adjourned. No bail bond shall be ac
cepted after midnight till 9 o'clock in
the morning.
The official Interpreters of the courts
shall remain in the room set apart for
them while any department of the
courts is in In case of inabil
ity of an Interpreter to attend throu^n
sickness or oth-rwlse it shall be the
duty of such interpreter to furnish the
court with a competent substitute to
be paid out of his own salary. Xo In
terpreter shall interfere directly or in
directly in any business of the courts
or solicit business for any attorney.
When any violation of these rules re
gardlng interpreters is reported it shall
be the duty of th* presiding Judgs to
request an investigation by the ap
pointing power.
No attorney will be empowered to
represent the State except the prose
cuting attorney of the court or his ns
sistant unless on motion of the prose
cuting attorney.
The rules of procedure shall be: First,
sentences of court; second, ex-parte
motions of prosecuting attorney; third,
motions on behalf of the defense.
It Is possible that other suggestions
may be made to-mnrrow, but these
are enough, if adopted, to work a rad
ical and much-needed change in the
manner of conducting business in the
Police Courts and will do away wkh
many causes for complaint.
HERE THE GIRL
IS AT HOME
Delightfully Novel Insti
tution Projected by
Dr. Wilson.
No Rules, No Board, No Man
ager, No Preliminary
Tests.
Simply m Place Where the Young
Working Women May Rest
Happily.
The Rev. John Wilson, pastor of the
Howard-Street Church, believes in an
ounce of prevention.
"The work I advocate is not so pic
turesque, it is not nearly so easy
to interest others in as reclaim
ing the vicious. It's odd. yet it's
true, and I suppose it's human na
ture, but for ten good women who will
work to reform an erring Bister there is
only one who feels It her duty to pre
vent that sister's becoming wayward.
"My wish is to found here a co-oper
ative home like that I founded in New
York. Within thirty minutes' travel
from my church there were at least ten
Institutions where dissolute women
would be received and cared for. There
was not one place where a respectable,
virtuous girl, temporarily out of work
or working for very low wages, could
j find accommodation."
There does seem something novel
about a plan for the comfortable hous
ing of girls who have not that claim
upon society which Is a covert threat.
The only revenge that lies within a
working girl's power upon an indiffer
ent, well-fed world is to become a
charge upon It. But to do that she
must deteriorate morally. Dr. Wilson
says: "Good women are not interested
In needy women unless the latter are
naughty."
There is another point about Dr. "Wil
son's plan which has been successfully
operated In New York for four years,
that is delightfully novel.
Here is an Institution absolutely with
out rules, without a board, without a
meddlesome manager, with no barri
cade of preliminary tests and qualifi
cations, with no strangling red tape re
quirements to discourage those who
would enter and to stltle those who are
already members.
Are you a decent woman? Then come
in. Your creed may be whatever best
satisfies you. The disposition of your
time is your own affair. The people,
male or female, who visit you shall be
no more restricted than in visiting you
at your own home. In fact, you shall
be treated as though you were human,
though poor. The cost of this to you
will be $2 per w<*ek, and you will have
the privilege of using laundry and sew
ing room.
'Everybody has an Ideal," said Dr.
Wilson. "Mine is to establish the sort
of atmosphere there is among the
daughters of a big family on a farm. I
would have no rules, no constitution
and by-laws. I would have a treasur
er, though, so that I should not handle
the funds and run any risk of black
mail and that sort of thing.
"There are In San Francisco, as there
are In New York, many girls who work
from morning till night for J3 a week.
Where can those who are without rela
tives find homes In this city? And
when a girl is homeless, when she
doesn't earn enough to house and feed
her, leaving out clothing, what a slight,
a fearfully slight barrier there is be
tween her and depravity!
"A woman, a working woman gave
me the first $50 I received in New York
to start a home there. We got a base
ment, but it was steam heated, and we
put in twelve beds, curtained or screen
ed into something like privacy. Then
there was a large sitting-room. This
was the beginning. Now the co-opera
tive home occupies a flat with quarters
for eighteen boarders. Each girl was
expected to keep her own room in or
der, and when girls who could not af
ford to pay the home's prices were ad
mitted, they were given work to do
that would pay for their board.
"People have asked me If I found the
girls grateful.
"I have simply answered that they
didn't owe me or any one else grati
tude. It's purely a business arrange
ment, tempered with Just a little mer
cy and humanity. But Mrs. Wilson
and IâltI â It is she who Is the real head In
thin undertaking â have found innumer
able cases for whose sake we were
gTateful that there was such a place
in the world.
"There Is need for such a place in
Pan Francisco. People do not realize
how many women are working here
who earn barely enough to keep them.
They should have a home, a good home,
which they can pay for, and which will
no more be a charity than the educa
tion of our sons at Yale or Harvard is,
though it costs four times as much to
maintain those institutions as is paid
In for tuition.
"With $500 a home could be provid
ed for young: working women, which If
each fifteen members paid $2 a week,
would be self-supporting. If rent and
furniture were provided such a home
could be started Immediately. It
should be located near town, bo that
jrirls might be spared carfare and loss
of time.
"Think how little this fs. In compari
son with the sums expended for the re
clamation of the weak and wicked!
And think how much the number of
these might be diminished were one
tenth, yes. one one-hundredth, given for
the benefit of those who are strong and
virtuous enough to resist temptation.
"This scheme Is perfectly practical.
Tt has been done. It could be done, and
it should be done."
Lectures on European Travel.
Next Tuesday evening Dr. Rummer
| will commence a course of five lectures
i at the Young Men's Christian Associa
tion. Mason and Ellis streets, to be given
i every Tuesday evening on "European
Travels." Each lecture will be Illustrated

fln filmshouse Entertainment^
An entertainment was given on Friday
evening at the Almshouse for the amuse
ment of the Inmates. The affair was ar
ranged by Captain Reddy. and the talent
furnished by several well known ama
teurs. Mr. Thomas McCarthy had charge
of the details and management of the
affair, assisted by Mr. Ike Davis. There
were many prominent people present ait
invited guests.

GOOD THINGS
FOR THEM ALL
Toys and Bonbons Galore
for Sunday-School
Children.
The Jesuits Will Give Their
Annual Christmas-Tree
Festival.
Students End Their Retreatâ Sacred
Heart League Ladies to Re
ceiva Diplomas.
The annual Christmas Tree Festival
for the children attending the St. Ig
natius Sunday School will be held this
afternoon in the church hall, on Van
Ness avenue and Fulton street. The
hour erf this festival is not made public
owing to the fact that the teachers of
the Sunday School want none but the
children to attend. At previous festi
vals of this kind grown people from all
over the city would attend In large
numbers, ami It Is for this reason prin
cipally that the exact hour will not
be mentioned.
Toys, candy and everything likely to
please the children have been provided
at the expense of the Jesuit Fathers.
The idea of giving toys as presents
originated â with the Jesuits, and re
places the old custom of giving pray
er-bocks, holy pictures and other re
liÃious mementos.
It has been the custom heretofore to
have an entertainment In conjunction
with the Christmas festival, but this
feature will be abandoned this year for
the principal reason that it does not in
terest the children, and as the festival
is held expressly for the benefit of them
it has been decided to entirely do away
with it.
"It is more like a penance than an
enjoyment for th* children to sit and
listen to operatic solos and uninterest
ing recitations," said one of the priests
yesterday afternoon, "and in view of
this fact I think it Is wise to strike this
entertainment from the general Christ
mas programme."
The students of St. Ignatius College
will end their retreat this morning by
receiving holy communion in a body at
the S o'clock mass, to be held in the
basement chapel. This was the regular
annual retreat, and was participated In
by the students of the entire college.
The Rev. Father Finigan had charge
of the preparatory classes, while the
Rev. Father Van der Erdan conducted
the rotreat for the boys of the advanc
ed classes.
The new half-year term of the Jesuit
College will commence to-morrow
morning, and applications of students
desirous of taking courses should be
forwarded at once to Father Allen.
An additional feature of this year's
curriculum will be the teaching of mod
ern languages, free of charge, to stu
dents desirous of studying them.
This project was commenced a few
months ago, and as it proved very suc
cessful it has been decided to put the
advantage of mastering these lan
guages at the disposal of all the stu
dents of the jollege who care to study
them. There are two courses of Ger
man to be taught; one to the prepara
tory classes and an advanced course to
the collegiate classes.
The first meeting of the session will
be held by the Boys' Orchestra next
Thursday evening at 7 o'clock in the
basement of the college. This orches
tra is composed of boys well advanced
In the study of music, and is consider
ed by the Jesuits and such laymen as
have heard it In public concert to be
cmc of exceptional merit.
Twenty-five promoters of the League
of the Sacred Heart will receive diplo
mas on the evening of the feast of the
Epiphany, which will be observed next
Tuesday.
A solemn high mass will be cele
brated next Sunday morning at the
main church on Hayes street in honor
of the feast of the Sacred Heart. His
Grace Archbishop Riordan will deliver
the sermon.
The Rev. Father Wyman of the Paul
ist community will deliver the sermon
at vespers to-night on the subject of
"The Finding of the Messiah,"

Mrs. George H. Williams and Frank M.
Ames, doing business under the firm

session of the plaintiff, which were as
signed to him by their original owners.
Diphtheria Spreading.
Six new cases of diphtheria were re
ported to the Health Office yesterday,
causing considerable alarm among the
officers of the board.
They were located as follows: Two at
1938 Ellis street, one each at 149 Prospect
place, 978 Post street, 2220 Clay street and
733 Chestnut street. The continued spell
of cold weather has rendered the spread
of the disease possible and It Is expected
that unless the temperature moderates
many new cases will be developed.

CAUGHT BY
THE WILES
OF A SIREN
John Allman Lured
to His Ruin by a
Woman.
Pitiable Plight of a Re
cent Arrival From
Victoria.
Thrown in the Tanks in This
City on a Charge of
Burglary.
WORKED FOR REVENGE.
Robbed thÂ« Falsa OnÂ© Who Had
Accomplished His Sad
Downfall.
John Allman, who was arrested
|ThÂ«xÂ»day night and charged with burg
lary, still languishes In a cell in the
City Prison. Behind his arrest is a
pathetic story of a prosperous citizen
losing his head on account erf an at
tractive young woman, -whose only aim
â¢was to get possession of his money.
Allman, accompanied by his wife, ar
rived here several weeks ago from Vic
toria, where he was engaged in busi
ness. Meeting a friend, Allman con
sented to "do" the tenderloin district.
They visited a number of saloons, and
In one of them Allman met the woman
â who is responsible for his downfall.
She is known only by the name of Mat
tie. Allman, despite the fact that he
had a wife, fell desperately in love
â with her. Almost nightly he would re
turn home in an intoxicated condition
and abuse his wife. Realizing that his
affection for her had vanished Mrs. All
man packed her grip and returned to
her parents' home in British Columbia.
Allman apparently became more devot
ed to "Mattie," and offered to make
her his wife. She pretended to love
him until his money was gone, and
then failing to induce him to telegraph
for more "stuff." as she expressed it,
she informed him that she had no fur
ther use for him. The foolish man be
came distracted and drank more heav
ily than ever. In his desperation he
â went to her room and pleaded with her
to become his wife, after promising to
take her to his home in Victoria. She
refused to listen to his entreaties and
ordered him to leave her room. Smart
ing under the humiliation and cursing
himself for his foolishness Allman
awaited an opportunity to "set even"
with her. The following day he rented
a room in -the same house, unknown to
the woman. He told the landlady that
he was from the East, and that he was
a race horse man. Shortly after hÂ»
had taken possession of the room he
saw the gay Mattie leaving her apart
ments. As she emerged from the house
he broke into her room and stole her
sealskin sacque and some other arti
cles.
H> placed the stolen property under
his bed, intending to dispose of them at
an opportune time. Unfortunately for
him, he was suspected, and the police
were notified. The property was found
where he had concealed it, and Allman
was taken to the &ty Prison and
locked up in the tanks.
Last night the woman visited the
City Prison and had a short conversa
tion with him. She assured him that
she would not prosecute him, provid
ing that he promised to return to hia
wife. Allman keenly feels his disgrace,
and is anxious to return to Victoria.
A MISLEADING STATEMENT.
An Evening Paper Does an In-
justice to the Jubilee
Management.
The statement made by an evening
paper that the Theatrical Mechanics'
Association No. 2 was not interested in
the construction of Foats for the Jubi
lee parade is denied by the members of
the parade committee which has
charge of that portion of the celebra
tion.
Secretary Fisher of that committee
â when seen last night stated that when
the matter of floats came up for con
sideration before the body two parties
produced bids and that the Theatrical
Mechanics' Association was the lowest
and Andrews and Cannon were award
ed the contract under the supposition
that they represented the association.
At all deliberations of the committee
they were accompanied by a man who
represented himself as president of the
association. Their bid being the lowest
it was accepted and the contract was
awarded to them and $"('0 was paid on
account of the $1500 contract.
The committee believes that they j
awarded the contract to the members \
of the Theatrical Mechanics' Associa
tion and in doing so recognized the or
ganized labor unions of the city.
Such representations as were made to !
them bear out this assumption and any '
statements emanating from unknown 'â 
parties are untrue and are denied.
The secretary nf the parade commit
tee has been instructed to at once com
municate with the Theatrical Mechan- '
Ics' Association and ascertain the exact
status of affairs.
The meeting of citizens called at the
Board of Trade rooms at San Jose yes
terday afternoon for the purpose of
making arrangements for a representa
tion of Santa Clara County at the
Golden Jubilee celebration proved a
"frost." But nine persons put in an ap
pearance and eight of these were mem
bers of the Pioneer Society. The ln'-k
of interest on the part of citizens in the
matter caused much indignation and
was commented upon by those present.
The question of making an exhibit at
the mining fair and participating in the
parade was discussed at length, and
the following committee appointed to
canvass among the business men to
raise funds so that Santa Clara County
can make a proper showing:: J. S. Sel
ny, Colonel T. 11. Weaver. J. P. Fay, C.
M. Wooster and Frank Stock. James
E. Gordon was rum ed to see the ex
ecutive committee of the Golden Jubi
lee celebration and make all necessary
arrangements.
The Almaden Quicksilver Mining
Company will make a fine exhibit at
the mining fair. It will consist of a
large lake of quicksilver, upon which
vessels of iron, copper and other metals
will be floated. Harry J. Bee, a Cali
fornia pioneer of 1830 and now a resi
dent of this city, will be in charge of
the county exhibit and represent the
California pioneer.

GRAND ARCH ADOPTED BY THE JUBILEE COMMITTEE.
SHE executive committee of the
Golden Jubilee Committee has
adopted a design for an arch of
Doric architecture submitted by
Walthew & Corbett. The jubilee
parade committee favored a design
of Sutter's mill, but owing to the possi
bility of such a structure being demol
ished by wind and weather, the executive
committee deemed it b*>st to adopt a more
substantially built arch.
The arch is to be formed of wood,
painted white. The crown, which will be
illuminated by a myriad of electric
lights, will be supported by slender col
umns, four on either side; and these col
umns In turn will be supported by sub
stantial pedestal?. In the center of the
erowa on one side in gilded relief will be
the arms of California; in a correspond
ing position on the opposite side will be
the arms of San Francisco. Upon the
corners of the crown will stand in relief
figures of Marshall and of Sutter. Be
neath the coat of arms will be, also in
gilded relief, a miner's pick, pan and
shovel. The dates of 1848 and 1898 beneath

NEW MOTHER-IN-LAW JOKE.
For a week the guilty wretch had
possessed the secret in silence, start -
' ing at every sound and catching his
| breath at every shadow. Yet he told
himself that he was Quite safe, that
no one knew of his guilt but himself,
i They might guess, but they could
i prove nothing. He would do it again
|if he had a chance. It was nature's
i first law to protect oneself. He had
thought it all out â how he. would act,
and what he would say. Yet when the
first breath of suspicion was directed
toward him he started and turned
pale, and all the defense which he had
so elaborately constructed fell to the
ground when his wife turned her ques
tioning eyes upon him and said:
"John, did you post that letter to
! mother I gave you last week?"
"Yes."
"Are you sure?"
"Yes."
"She never received it."
"Yesâ l mean â Dash it, Iâ"I â "
"John, don't swear."
"Yes â erâ l mean I won't, my dear."
"It is very strange."
"Yes â cr â perhaps it was lost in the
post."
"Yes; that must be it," mused his
wif#. "I wrote mother to postpone
her visit for a few months, and I have
just received a letter saying that we
migfit expect her to-day."
Once alone the wretched man prayed
that a nine-story house might fall
upon him and crush him.

where he Is engaged in farming. While
walking along Market street he was ac
costed by a fashionably dressed man,
who pretended to have been introduced
to him in the Garden City. Swansen
foolishly admitted that he was looking
for a doctor who had treated him some
time ago. The stranger said he was
well acquainted with the medical gen
tleman and offered to accompany
Swansen to his office. Swansen ac
cepted his invitation and together they
went to a room on Post street. Sev
eral men were seated about a table en
gaged in a game of studhorse poker as
they entered. One of them was intro
duced to Swansen as a warm friend
of the doctor for whom he was looking.
After a short conversation Swansen
was induced to take a hand, with the
result that he lost $500 in a few min
utes. Realizing that he had been
robbed Swansen visited police head
quarters, and Gibson and Egan were
detailed to arrest the schemers.
From a description given of the men
they apprehended Poulter and Miller
and looked them up in the tanks, pend
ing an investigation. Last night Swan
sen visited the City Prison and was
shown the men. He was unable to
identify them, and they were released
by order of Captain Bohen. They were
however ordered to leave the city un
der penalty of being arrested on a
charge of vagrancy.
Recently several complaints have
been received at police headquarters
concerning the operations of the men,
but owing to the refusal of their vic
tims to prosecute they were not mo
lested.
Captain Bohen is determined to rid
tho city of "sure thing grafters," and
with this end in view he has specially
detailed Gibson and Egan to arrest
them.
Something Wrong Witf) the Scales.
The story is <Â»f a young and de
voted father. The baby was his first,
and he wanted to weigh it.
"It's a bumper!" he exclaimed.
"Where are the scales?'"
The domestic hunted up an old-faÃh
ioned pair that had come down from a
former generation. It was the only
weighing machine in the house. The
baby, wrapped in the fleecy folds of
some light fabric, was suspended from
the hook, and the proud young father
assumed charge of the operation.
"I'll try It at eight pounds," he said,
sliding the weight along the beam at
that figure.
"It won't ...o. She weighs ever so
much more than that."
He slid the weight along several
notches further.
"By George!" he said, "she weighs
more than ten pounds! Eleven â twelve
âthirteenâ fourteen! Is it possible?"
He Bet the baby and the scales down
and rested himself a moment.
"Biggest baby I ever saw," he pant
ed, resuming the weighing process.
"Fifteen and a halfâ sixteen. This
thing won't weigh her. See! Sixteen
Is the last notch, and she jerks it up like
a feather. Go and get a big pair of
scales at some neighbor's. I'll bet a
tenner that she weighs over twenty
pounds. Millie," he shouted, rushing
Into the next room, "she's the biggest
baby in this country. Weighs over
sixteen pounds."
"What did you weigh her on?" in
quired the young mother.
"On the old scales In the kitchen."
"The figures on those are only
ounces," she replied, quietly. "Bring
me the baby, John."

Nothing could better prove the utter

with which a few hundred German
sailors have been able to seize one of
her most valuable harbors. Here is a

they have no shadow of a claim, and
with only the shadow of a pretext for
their action. CJose to them is a big
town, every one of whose inhabitants
has a deadly hatred of foreigners, even
when inoffensive, and within a few
days march are millions and millions
of men who, under Intelligent leader

effectively. Yet the Germans have
met with little more resistance than
they would have encountered if they
had tried to steal the luncheons of half

shove them off into the sea by mere
force of numbers, and yet the thought
of attempting this does not seem to have
occurred to anybody in all the huge
so-called empire. Instead, the Chi
nese are offering money, concessions,
anything, if the insolent strangers will
only go away, and, in anticipation of
refusal, are negotiating with other
strangers, equally rapacious, for as
sistance in accomplishing what they
might perform for themselves in
ten minutes. This state of affairs is
mysterious only to those who think of
China as a country with a ruler and a
people. In reality the Germans have
invaded only the bit of land on which
they stand and have insulted a few
officials at Peking and a few peasants
on the coast. The rest of that vast
population will probably never hear of
this piratical act, and will not care
particularly about it if they do.

"A feast or a famine." That's what
the Police Commissioners are begin
ning to believe. First a case, then
cases, and afterward mysteries. Who
can blame them for their thoughts?
"What's to be done?" and almost be
fore the question is answered a police
man, who is under the impression that
the general public is asleep, finds him
self without a glittering adornment
which gives him both the right to ride
on street cars free of charge and to
impose upon a good-natured public.
Last evening Officer John Brownlie
was dismissed from the force on ac
count of complications of which he is
aware, and last evening a formal com
plaint was presented to the Commis
sioners against Officer P. C. Peters,
who is alleged to have "fooled" a man
who had loaned him quite a sum of
money.
Thomas Harris, a conductor on car
No. 5 of the Sutter-street Railway
Company, will be the complaining wit
ness. According to his story the su
perintendent of the line, Johnson Rey
nolds, will assist him in the case to
the utmost of his ability. It seems
from statements made that Peters and
Harris were at one time friends. They
told their pleasures and their joys to
each other, and yet at the present
time each is wondering who will be
the victorious party in robbing the
other of a position which now gives
him the sustenance of life.
Feeling or thinking of olden times
does not draw them away from the de
sire to square accounts, and some
thing will "be doing" before many
days have passed. Two letters have
been sent to the Police Commissioners
by Harris, and without doubt his plea
has been answered. Peters' case will
probably oome up at the next meet
ing, and It is thought a star wil be
awaiting a newcomer.
The story as told by Conductor Har
ris reflects to a considerable extent
upon the honor and integrity of Offi
cer Peters. He said last evening:
"Peters came to me and through a
plea of friendship borrowed $100, which
he promised to return in installments
of $20 per month and $10 at the end of
the payment for the use of the money.
I willingly gave him the money, but
up to the present time I have not re
ceived one cent of it, nor the interest
on the sum loaned.
"I did not press Peters for the
amount until the last few weeks, when
I absolutely needed the money. My
brother had his knee dislocated, and
there have been other doctor bills to
pay and I was in rather a tight place.
I went to Peters and asked him for the
amount. He told me to wait a few
days, and that has since been the cry.
"Things of this kind went on from
day to day. and I concluded to make a
last appeal. When I again asked for
the amount due me or even one of the
installments I was cursed for my trou
ble. Hot words arose, and I cursed
back, with the result that I waa
locked up by Peters on charges of dis
turbing the peace and using vulgar
language.
"My case first came up in Judge
Campbell's court on January 5, one day
after my arrest, but the case was con
tinued until the next week. Then it
was called in Judge Joachimsen's court
on January 8. The case is marked as
dismissed on the records, but I was
told, possibly by a friend of Peters,
that I had been fined $5, but that the
case had been fixed. I am of the opin
ion, however, that the case was dis
missed. I will press the charges
against the officer to the bitter end.
and I think my superiors will help me
in the case."
After the conductor's arrest he was
released on his own recognizance, but

The Nun)ber of Languages.
English Exchang-e.
The least learned are aware that
there are many languages in the
world, but the actual number is prob
ably beyond the dreams of ordinary
people. The geographer Baldi enum
erated 860 which are entitled to be
considered as distinct languages, and
5000 which may be regarded as
dialects.
Adulguns, another modern writer
on this subject, reckons up 3064 lan
guages and dialects existing and
which have existed. Even after we
have allowed either of these as the
number of languages we must
acknowledge the existence of almost
infinite minor diversities, for almost
every province has a tongue more or
less peculiar, and this we may well
believe to be the case throughout the
world at large.
It is said there are little islands ly
ing close together in the South Seas,
the inhabitants of which do not under
stand each other.
Of the 860 distinct languages enum
erated by Baldi, 89 belong to Europe,
114 to Africa, 123 to Asia, 417 to Ameri
ca, 117 to Oceanica â by which term he
distinguishes the vast number of isl
ands stretching between Hindustan
and South America.
Soup Wit!) a Vengearjce.
British Humor.
One of the highest officers in the
German army is very particular that
his soldiers are properly fed. He is 'â 
in the habit of making unexpected j
visits to the barracks and inspecting j
the food in person. On fhe occasion *
of one of these visits he perceived two
soldiers carrying a steaming boiler
from the kitchen.
"Put it down. Fetch a spoon," he
commanded.
The astonished soldiers looked at
each other.
One of them rushed off, but reap- 1
peared in a few moments with a
spoon.
'â¢I want to see what sort of soup you
get," said the general as he dived into
the boiler with the spoon, but as soon
as he tasted it he spat it out, ex- ;
claiming:
"What sort of broth is that? It
tastes like dish water. What is it
anyhow?"
"That's Just what it is, your excel
lency." replied the soldier. "It's the
water the dishes were washed in."
EN DESHABILLE.
Deshabille can be Impressive, as we
learn In a letter of Charles Dickens to
the late James T. Fields, the American
publisher. Dickens wrote: "I dreamed
that somebody was dead. It was a
private gentleman, and a particular
friend, and I was greatly overcome
when the news was broken to me (very
delicately) by a gentleman in a cocked
hat, top boots and a sheet. Nothing
else. 'Good God. I said, 'is he dead?'
'He is as dead, sir,' rejoined the gentle
man, 'as a doornail. But we must all
die, Mr. Dickens, sooner or later, my
dear sir.' 'Ah!' I said; 'yes, to be sure.
Very true. But what did he die of?'
The gentleman burst into a flood of
tears and said, in a voice broken by
emotion, 'he christened his young
est child, sir. with a toasting fork!' "
Some sensitive men refuse to appear
in deshabille on any terms. "There
was a lovable English clergyman,"
says Mark Twain In "A T,ru-rnp
Abroad," "who did not get to table
d'hote at all. His breeches had turned
up missing, and without any equiva
lent. He said he was not more partic
ular than other people, but he had no
ticed that a clergyman at dinner with
out any breeches was almost sure to
excite remark."
The completest deshabille Is obtain
able in the tropics. The late Henry
Drummond once wrote home from
Central Africa that he had nothing on
but a helmet and three mosquitoes.
Sydney Smith, who was the first man
to pray in August for the power to
take off his flesh and sit in his bones
(a blessed condition which, on paper
at least, has been made possible by
Professor Roentgen), described the
height of bliss attainable by a Sierra
Leone native, to be sitting in one-half
of a melon, with the other half on his
head, eating the pulp.â Cornhill Maga

DOWN ON AN ENGLISH ACADEMY.
Sir: In this decadent month, after the
Rreat sea serpent has usually risen once
more to the surface of the press â only
perhaps, to be choked in a far from un
seasonable effort to emulate the diges
tion of other contributors, by swallowing
the gigantic gooseberryâ no sensible man
will iVel and no honest man will affect
surprise at the resurrection of a more
"ridiculous monster" than these The
notion of an English academy is too se
riously stupid for farce and too essen
tially vulg-ar for comedy. But that a
man whose outspoken derision of the
academic Ideal or idea has stood on rec
ord for more than a fow years and
given deep offense to nameless if hlirh
mind^d censors by the frank expression
of its contempt and the unqualified ve
hemence of its ridicule, should enjoy the
unsolicited honor of nomination to a
prominent place In so unimaginable a
gatheringâ colluvles llterarum it prob
ably would turn out to be if ever it slunk

unloosened. Of the original large list
of entries but seven accepted the
weights. Pleur de Lis, with 113 pounds
up and Willie Martin to do the pilot
ing, had first call in the betting, at odds
of 8 to 5, with equally as much coin
going in on Tom Griffin's horse, Rubi
con, at a shade higher price. The lat
ter was injudiciously handled by
Thorpe, or he might have been return
ed the winner. When tho field was
sent away to a pretty start, Elrod rush
ed Lucky Dog out in front at a rattling
clip, with Rubicon hard ridden at his
heels. This was the race to the stretch,
where the two leaders were staggering
from the pace set. The Dog quit first
and Rubicon temporarily showed in
front. The boys now all sat
down to ride ir. earnest, and Griffin's
entry was soon passed. Martin simply
shook the favorite up. and, coming fast
on the outside, the shapely daughter of
Maxim won with apparent ease, reel
ing of the mile in 1:43%. In a drive
Imp. Tripping took the place from Shil
ler, with Rubicon a close fourth. The
race was worth $700 to the winner, to
gether with a valuable silver cup, pre
sented by the firm of Shreve & Co.
On his preceding race, when beaten a
head by San Venada. the Jennings en
try, Glorian, with Willie Martin up
was installed a 1 to 2 choice for the
first race of the day, a seven furlong
run for three-year-olds. It turned out
only a gallop for Schreiber's Imperious
which, coupled with Dr. Bernays, was
6tol in the betting. The gelding made
all the running, and led the favorite
over the line in a gallop. Prestor fin
ished a good third.
The next event at six furlongs fitted
O'Connell like a new overcoat, and with
1 to 2 about him in the ring around
post time Speir's sprinter ran circles
around his winning under re
straint fmm Martha, second choice in
the betting. The third choice, Zamar,
finished in the show. Cash Day and
Lucky Dog were scratched.
The mile and a furlong was conceded
to Souffle before the race was decided
and the mare won without difficulty,
ruling a pronounced 11 to 12 favorite.
Collins put up quite an argument for a
piece of the route and then fell back,
but came again at the end and secured
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 9, 1898.
the place from Personne. Benamela
did not make much of a showing.
Some tall speculation was indulged in
on the six starters in the mile and a
half hurdle handicap. A big plunge
was made on Nestor with McMahon in
the saddle, forcing his odds down from
5 to 3 to 2 favoritism. He ran un
paced. McAuliffe sent the light
weighted Viking with a "'catch" of 123
pounds on his back out in front, and
though once headed by Silverado, again
assumed first position in the stretch
and won hands down. Silverado took
the place from Governor Budd in a
drive. The winner was a 10 to 1
chance.
On all previous performances George
Lee looked pounds the best of the
six three-year-olds starting in the final
mile, selling, run and was Justly in
stalled a warm 7 to 10 chance. Piggott
made a botch of it, getting him away
from the post, and the youngster was
never able to overtake the 40 to 1 shot
Bonita ridden by Dick Clawson, which
won, ridden out by a length.
Track. Items.
J. j. O'Neill and Abe Levy, two well
! known Eastern pencilers, are new ar
i rivals on the racing scene. No doubt
they will both be seen on the block in
the near future.
The Pacific Coast Breeders and Own
; era' Protective Association will hold a
; meeting at the Baldwin Hotel on Tues
| day evening.
'"Electrical" Morse rode Bonita on her
previous essay, and according to the
form book the filly was only beaten
about thirty-three lengths. Those who
backed her yesterday must have had
some very, very choice information.
Owner Fink, it is said, has fallen in
love with our California climate, so
much so in fact that he intends to have
some, of it bottled to take back East
with him in the spring. It certainly
does work wonders with his horses.
Ntwsgatherer's reversal cost him a
I sixty-day suspension, and the pleasant
; recital of Bonita yesterday should cost
him sixty years.
McAuliffe, who rode Viking, put up
: as nicely a timed ride as has been seen
around in these parts for many a moon.
If it is a good sample of what he is
capable of doing the boy should have
; no difficulty in securing mounts.
If Little Cripple was possessed of any
speed during the early morning hours
yesterday, the gelding must have loan
; ed it to the horse occupying the stall
next to him before the third race was
called.
Dave Gideon and Peter Riley l>oth
had an even $500 on George Lee. They
both viewed the race with feelings
akin to a man falling from a balloon.
Personne, the "intermittent" horse,
ran a very fair race yesterday. O'Con
, nor. the diminutive Celt, handled him
in clever fashion.

Rev. Davis brands as llbelous is as
follows:
'SAN QUENTIN PRISON. Jan. 7.â The
scene at San Quentin last night has never
had a like since the tall prison walls have
marred the beauty of San Quentin Point.
The darkness brought- a great crowd of
persons, among the arrivals being Mr.

the execution, newspaper men and the
Rev. Edwards Davis of Oakland. Davis ,
had come in the service of a morning i
newspaper, and his actions last night will '
not soon be forgotten by those who wit

He began his performance by entering
the dining-room of the hotel, where a
half dozen newspaper men were at their
meal, and flourished a half-emptied bot- I
tie over his- head while announcing In a 'â 
nowise whispered tone that the: color of j
the contents was a bright red.
He was attired as usual in a tall hat, .
I a modish frock coat and a white waist
! coat.
Immediately after his dinner he was
taken to an apartment and kept seclud
ed until nearly 8 o'clock. An attempt was i
made to Interview him, but a warder at â 
his door announced that he was- under
contract to talk for only one newspaper. :
> At 8 o'clock the Rev. Edwards Davis !
drove up to the prison gate and was ad- i
mitted to see the older Durrnnt.
He remained In the cÂ«Â»ll about an hour
and a half, and his exit from the prison
was attended with some disturbance.
Several friends among the throng
outside attempted to talk with him as he
emerged through the gates. A scrimmage
followed, during which the minister got
very frightened, and the elder Durrant
cried out to the crowd in a very shrill
voice, tremulous with rage and excite
tnrnt:
"Ood! Haven't yon any respect for a
minister of the gospel?" :..â¢Â«,
a prise-fighter named Rochette. who
had Followed all evening In the wake of
the Rev. Edwards Davs.shcwed a desire
to rescue the minister by force from
those who importuned him to talk, but a
guard with a gun instantly subdued the
I tighter. Davis then entered a waiting
carriage and disappeared for the night.
Rev. Davis states in his pleadings
that prior to the publication of that
"defamatory" article he had always
borne a good reputation, but since its
publication he has been exposed to the
hatred, contempt, ridicule and obloquy
of those who read it. In consequence
he alleges that he has been damaged
in the sum of $50,000, which he now
, sues to recover.
In the following signed statement
Rev. Edwards Davis explains his as
sociation with Durrant upon which the
Bulletin's attack was based:
"My association with the Durrants
at San Quentin was at their invita
tion. I had no desire to be unneces
sarily identified with the unfortunate
family, but when I learned that the
prisoner was dissatisfied with Chap
lain Drahms and also with Rev. Wil
liam Rader. I felt that I might be of
| service to the condemned man In his
adversity. I thereupon consented to
; officiate.
"Neither then nor now was I work
ins in behalf of the press, as is appar
ent from the fact that my only Intel -
view was limited to a few lines in the
Examiner. However, after remaining
in the presence of the prisoner for over
an hour, and being in conversation
much of that time, I might have given
an extensive report if Buch had been
my desire.
"The news gatherers on my Issuance
from the prison became irascible be
cause I would not pander to their de
mand. Their threats were ignored, as
gentility r-nly could elicit my reply.
That I was trying to assist and comfort
the Durrants is evident from the fact
that my reference to him was charac
terized with kindness and magnanim
ity.
"I have no regret ahout the affair
except in the case of libelous report- in
that I was discharging a duty and I
am not concerned about the conse
quences of right action. Last Sunday I
was unanimously elected to my fourth
year's charge of the Central Church of

Many Prisoners Sentenced Yes
terdayâChirjese Murderer
Sentenced to Hang.
Yesterday was sentence day in the
various departments of the Superior
Court, and several prisoners were plac
ed away in prison therein to spend di
vers terms of years, while one, a Chi
nese murderer, was condemned to fol
low in the footsteps of Durrantâ to
hang by the neck until he is dead. Wee
Ting, alias Wee Tung, who shot to
death a relative named Yee Lack
Chung in the old Globe Hotel Build
ing on the 2d of last September, was
the man sentenced to give up his life
that the law might be vindicated.
Judge Dunne passed sentence on the
prisoner, but postponed the setting of
the date of execution. This will be
done in the near future.

life within the walls of San Quentin
Prison. George Herring, convicted of
mayhem, was sentenced to three years
in Folsom. Charles Gordon was sent
to Folsom for three years for at
tempting to pick the pocket of Mabel
Allen on the 26th of last September.
George Wilson, a second degree bur
glar, was given an opportunity to re
pent his sins during a two years' term
in Folsom. With the sentencing of
Wilson the labors of Judge Dunne in
that line were for the week completed.
Leo Gauggel, convicted of criminally
assaulting two young girls, was sen
tenced to 14 years in Folsom. In pass
ing sentence Judge Cook said: "I am
sorry the law will not permit me to give
you life imprisonment. As it isÂ». I will
give you the limitâ l 4 years." William
Keenan, a clothing store burglar, was
sentenced to four years in San Quen
tin. John Brown, who stole some

TRANSVAAL RAILROADS.
It is estimated that at least 500 miles
of railway will be laid during the next
few years in the Transvaal, and a rail
way contract in the Transvaal is said
to be well worth trying for. The con
tract is usually given to a burgher,
who turns it over to a third party "for
a consideration," and parties desiring
to secure contracts should by all means
be represented on the ground. The
temper of the Boers has undergone a
notable change as regards railroads,
which they so bitterly opposed a few
years ago, that it was needful to in
troduce the first almost by stealth,
under the name of "tramway," in or
der to disarm their prejudice against
all Hitlander innovations, and the de
struction of their ox teams by the rin
derpest having deprived them of all
means of transport, they are said to be
ready to welcome the railroads, whose
construction is warmly recommended
by President Kruger. The Volksraad
has already passed a bill for the con
struction of a line fro-m Machadodorp
to Krmelo. a distance of seventy miles*.
which will open up rich coal fields, and
is considering other projects. The Gov
ernment guarantees 3 1 / i per cent inter
est on the capital, receiving 1 In return
50 per cent of the surplus profits after
deducting the interest. As the coun
try is opened up there will be an im
mense demand for agricultural imple
ments, a portion of which will be pur
chnppd with the $750, 000 recently loaned
by the Government to the poorer Boers,
in order to enable them to work their
farms to better advantage.
The more bad habits the average
man has, the bottpr he seems to en-
Joy life's good things.

It wasn't lons after the scheme had
been in operation until some of "Hauz
mer's" dupes began to make their ap
pearance at i::54 Market street to get
the value of their nn ney. It came by
way of exchange and in the nature of
experience. The place was vacant and
had been for about five months, as they
all found by inquiry in the neighbor
hood. Prior to that time it had been
occupied by a hardware dealer.
When the female contingent of the
dupe division learned this fact there was
wailing from some and discreet silence
from those naturally of a cool dispo
sition. But most of the male contin
gent brought into use all the naughty
words they had ever learned while ex
pressing disapprobation of the way the
local telephone service is conducted.
Then came a strong desire to extend
the acquaintance with Mr. "Hauzmer"
that had started off so unhappilyâ for
all but the latter. Recourse to the
directory discovered the fact that
"Hauzmer"â so far as the name is
concernedâ is n myth. This was. how
ever, only another sample of his "high
art work."
If the gentleman is nabbed, and there
are several angry men and women hot
on his trail, his "art work" will ha\e
to he of the superlative degree in order
to escape retribution. A quarter of a
dollar is not a larg" sum to lose, but
some people take decided offense at
being fooled;
SHARKEY AND JEFFRIES.
Tr)c Pugilists Have Quit Training
and Are Now Eojoying
Themselves.
The National Club has Httle hope of
pulling off the Sharkey and Jeffries
twenty-round contest this month, but
the directors expect to hear favorably
from the health and police committee
of the Board of Supervisors next
month.
Possibly in February the sailor pug
ilist and the heavy-weight champion of
Southern California will decide, in this
city, the mooted question of suprem
acy.
Jeffries will leave this city to-mor
row for three days' outing on the
marshes of Sonoma with Charles Eck
ert. Billy Delaney and Al Smith. They
will be guests of a shooting club which
has leased several acres of marsh land
for duck-shooting purposes within
easy distance of Burdell's station.
Jeffries is very fond of duck shoot
ing and as he is said to be an expert
with the gun his friends expect to re
ceive some nice mallard and canvas
back duck on his return from the
happy huntinp grounds.
Last evpninn Sharkey visited Hay
wards and boxed six rounds with Billy
Gallagher in Villa Hall. The contest
was purely an exhibition between the
welter-weight and the heavyweight
and was witnessed by a large and en
thusiastic crowd.
The sailor pugilist will not make
known his future plans for a few days.
He said that if there were a possible
chance of meeting with Jeffries he
would remain in this State until the
contest takes place, otherwise he will
journey East and see what can be ac
complished so far as a second meeting
with Peter Maher is concerned.
DEFENDED THE GAS.
The President of the Company
Says It Is Not Over Poisonous.
The Streets Light Committee of the
Board of Supervisors spent several
hours yesterday investigating the qual-
I lty of gas that is furnished the citi
zens of San Francisco. The meeting
was held to look over Supervisor Lack
man's ordinance which is aimed to reg
ulate the percentage of carbonic mon
oxide in illuminating gas.
Coroner Hawkins was present to give
statistics tending to show that many
of the deaths from asphyxiation are
caused by the percentage of a large
amount of the deadly monoxide in the
gas that is furnished th- rate payers
of this city. His statements were ques
tioned by J. B. Crockett, president of
the gas company, who gave the rea
sons why water gas was used In San
Francisco, stating that a high candle
power illuminant was demanded by the
people, and that only water gas as fur
nished by the company would supply it.
He said that water gas had been used
in San Francisco eleven years, and that
It was only within the past two months
that two sensational papers had dis
covered the gas was poisonous. The
committee took the ordinance under
advisement
President Crockett offered to furnish
the Coroner with the nroper apparatus
to test the pas to ascertain its qualities.
CUTTING EXPENSES.
City Mall Commissioners Dismiss
All Employes but Or)e.
The City Hall Commissioners, in an
ticipation of the completion of the roof
of the building, and in consideration of
a lack of funds, reduced the expenses of
the boiy to almost nothing at a meet-
Ing: held yesterday.
The Commissioners decided to act
hereafter without compensation, and
Architect Shea follows suit. Then the
salary of the secretary was reduced
from $200 to $100 and all of the other
employes dismissed. The changes will
save the city $550 per month.
SHE HAS SEEN WONDROUS CHANGES.
Mighty changes have been wrojsrht by the hand of man in California
during the past fifty years. Comparatively there are few people now liv
ing who are able to fully appreciate from a personal observation these
wondrous changes in th*Â» development of the State during that time.
Such a person, however, is Mrs. Emma Loveland, at present a resident
of Santa Rosa, who is now In ;he city, the guest of her daughter, Mrs.
May Dufau, at the Grenoble lc dging-house.
Mrs. Loveland, wife of th<Â« iate Simeon Loveland, who died in Lassen
County about fivo years ago, is a native of Virginia, 63 years of ageâal
beit her sprightly manner and cheery mood would give one a different im
pression of her years.
Living in Missouri at the time, in 1846, Mr. and Mrs. Loveland and their
one child Joined a party of emigrants bound for California. The train
consisted of 100 wagons, mostly drawn by oxen, and between 300 and 400
people.
Making their way across the plains and over the mountains, the Love
lands arrived at Oregon City, Or., in the early part of January of 1847.
Here they remained until September of the same year, when news of the
discovery of gold in California was brought to that point and they came
to San Francisco.
Leaving his family established in a permanent residence in this city. Mr.
Loveland joined the eager army of gold-seekers and repaired to the north
ern mining regions. He continued his mining operations, with decided
success up to his latter years, until his demise.
Mrs. Loveland's recital of her trip across the plains is rich in incidents,
supplying a novel conglomeration of tragedy and comedy, joy and sor
row, humor and pathos, and were it published in detail it would com
prise a most interesting exposition of early pioneer history.
The journey made by her party was even more rigorous than was usual
in those days of pathfindirfg into unknown regions. Many of the people
in the train were insufficiently supplied with money, with the natural re
sult of much suffering for food and other daily necessities.
With a guide to show the way, the travelers had to make their own
road over a new route which had been laid out by a rascally schemer who
deliberately planned to make money off the emigrants. He sent them
several hundred miles out of their way, and, with a large stock of provi
sions, contrived to overhaul the train at a time when the supplies had
become nearly exhausted and to sell his wares to the wayfarers at enor
mous prices. A numerous bodyguard with an efficient armory equipment
served to save the villains life from the outraged pilgrims.
The party encountered serious and oft-recurring trouble with the In
dians, many cattle being stolen and two men being killed by the redskins.
The latter part of the journey was accomplished with no more than the
ordinary experiences incident to this pilgrimage of the early days. "But,"
declared Mrs. loveland, "our woes on the plains were enough for a life
time."
"You see," she said in conclusion of the interview, "when we wanted
groceries or meat we couldn't get them over the telephone, and if we need
ed a policeman we couldn't fetch him by beating on a lamp-post."
LINCOLN SCHOOL
WAS IN DANGER
Fire in the Basement Put
Out by a Quick
Policeman.
Electric Wires Set the Wood
Afire After the Pupils
Had Left.
The Second Blaze of the Kind Within
a Weekâ Building May Bo
Removed.
The Lincoln School building on Fifth
street near Market narrowly escaped
destruction by fire yesterday, and but
for the prompt action of Officer Minni
han of the police force might have been
burned to the ground.
The policeman was patrolling his
beat when he discovered smoke issuing
from the windows of the basement, in
which are situated a number of class
rooms. Hastily summoning a passing
citizen he groped his way through the
smoke and by the use of buckets of wa
ter obtained from a faucet in the rear
yard extinguished the flames that were
already licking their way up the wood
work toward the first floor.
After the danger was over it was
found that the fire came from the same
cause as that which threatened the to
tal destruction of the Columbia Thea
ter on the evening previous. It started
where the electric wires that furnished
the light for the building entered the
woodwork and but for the prompt ac
tion of the policeman in attacking the
flames might have ended in a disas
trous conflagration, as the building ad
joins the frame structures comprising
the Lincoln School property, extending
from Fifth street to the Emporium.
The damage from fire will be small
owing to the fact that it was discov
ered before it had m^de any great
headway. This is the second fire that
has occurred in school buildings within
the past ten days, the Redding School
nn Pine street narrowly escaping de
struction on Sunday last and only be
ing saved by the prompt action of the
employes of the Luiiine Baths.
It has been the intention of the Board
of Education for some time past to dis
pose of the Lincoln School grounds anri
buildings because of the fact that this
location is considered too valuable for
school purposes, and the danger that
threatened the school may hasten the
consummation of the project.

INJURED AT A FIRE.
A Blaze In the Missior) District
Causes Inteose Excitement.
An alarm through box 275 last even
ing was for a blaze at 316 Vicksburg
street, which threatened for a short
time to extinguish the adjoining block.
When the fire company arrived it was
discovered that a fierce blaze had al
ready gained headway, but it was not
thought necessary to turn in a double
alarm.
In a short time the buildings in the
rear had become ignited and only after
a struggle were the flames extinguished
and the adjoining buildings saved from
danger. The property was owned by
Michael Harrington and occupied as a
dwelling by J. W. Wycefloet. The
blaze was caused by the explosion of a
coal oil lamp. Wycefloct was injured
about the hands and face while en
deavoring to save some, of his furni
ture in the house. The damage will not
exceed $1000.

Generous Subscriptions Offered
to Build a Large
Cannery.
Tns Firet Week's Work Has Ex
ceeded the Expectations of
the Committee.
BAfI LKANDRO, Jan. B.â Never has ,
spirit been so thoroughly arous- ,
Â«- i as over the project to establish a <
large cannery at this place. The com
mittee has just completed its first week ;
of canvassing and the results have sur- ;
prised everybody.
The manner in which the committee i
has been received shows that the citi
zens realize the necessity and import
ance of doing something to help the
.m. For many years it has been
acknowledged that the larger part of the
growers' profits has been lost, owing
to the fact that heavy freight had to
â  be paid on fruit in order to reach a
cannery, and also because so much
â  damage occurred in transit.
Rev. Father McEvoy and Rev. B. W.

'â 'the following merchants have contri
buted the amounts against their
names:

SHARPE IS NOT
A DEAD ROBBER
.. A Suspected Oakland Man Who
Is Still Very Much
Alive.
His Companions Are Also Working
and All Benr Good Char
acters.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
yos Broadway, Jan. 8.
J. C. Sharpe of Oakland is not the
robber who was killed two weeks apo
while attempting to rob the station
agent at Keswick, Shasta County. He
is a reputable young man and very
much alive, according to Chief of Police
Lloyd.
Two weeks ago two masked men at
tempted to rolj the agent at Keswick
and demanded of him while flourishing
a pistol that he open the safe. He did
not oliey but commenced firing at the
robbers. Several shots were exchanged
and finally the. robbers ran out with the
agent still shooting, pursuing them.
When a short distance from the sta
tion, one of the robbers was shot and
killed, and for several days he was not
identified but now word has been sent
here (hat the murdered robber was J.
C. Sharpe of Oakland.
J. C. Sharpe of this city left here with
his friend George Bartlett and T. J.
Blaess for Trinity County during the
gold fever last August. Sheriff Hous
ton of Shasta asked Chief Lloyd to in
vestigate the matter and this has been
done. Bartlett and Blaess returned to
their homes in Oakland last October
and are .still here. Sharpe remained be
hind but went to Sacramento, where
he still is, several weeks before the
robbery at Keswick. Chief Lloyd finds
that all three of the young men are
good workmen and bear good charac
ters. Sharpe's parents reside in the
East and in his trunk which he left in
this city are a number of letters from
his father that bear out the son's repu
tation.
Word has been sent to Shasta County
that there will ha% - e to be another
"identification" of their dead robber.
SMALL BOOK QUESTIONED.
Chief of Police Lloyd Threatened
With a Suit for palse Im
prisonment.
OAKLAND, Jan. B.â E. J. Vander
werker threatens to sue Chief of Police
Lloyd for faise imprisonment. He re
cently surrendered himself to the po
lice, who wanted him on a phMXjgt of
failure to provide for his minor child.
His attorney asked for his releas.- on
hail but Chief Lloyd refused to allow it,
paying that he was wanted on a charge
of felony. He was released on a writ
of habeas corpus and now proposes to
fight back.
"T^e use of 'small books' In prisons,"
f?aid Attorney O'Brien to-day, "is out
. ragtous, although it is practiced in a
great many cities. The polite have no
right to hold a man on suspicion of his
be4ng a criminal. A prisoner must be
taken before the magistrate at the
next session of the court after he is
arrested, and the official who does not
do this is, according to the law on the
subject, guilty of a misdemeanor."
"It is customary," said the Judge, "to
pass a case til! the next day to allow
a complaint to be filed, when the prose
cution is not ready to swear to a com
plaint, but I admit that this is hardly
right. The time for swearing to a
complaint is before or Immediately
after the arrest, and the prisoner
should be arraigned before the nearest
magistrate at the next session of court
after the arrest. If there is no com
plaint, the court should order the pris
oner's release. The law in the case is
very plain, indeed, and it is true, as
Attorney O'Brien says, that an officer
ALAMEDA COUNTY NEWS.
cannot lawfully hold a prisoner with
out taking him before a magistrate."
HARBOURNE'S LIBRARY.
Offered to tf)e Pleasanton Com
mittee for a Mere Song.
OAKLAND, Jan. B.â Librarian Har
bourne of Alameda is not far away, and
this is proved by a letter received by
the chairman of the Pleasanton Pub
lic library committee, from F. A. Wood
worth of Alameda. The contents of
the letter would seem to show that
Harbourne is quietly disposing of his
personal property preparatory to a
real departure from his old haunts.
The letter says: "When the former
Alameda librarian, Mr. Harbourne, left
here, he wrote me asking me to look
out for his wife and boy ami 1 have
done so to the best of lay ability. Mrs.
Harbourne had very little money and
po was forced to sell her household fur
niture, etc., which she did and moved
to San Francisco. Among other things,
however, which she left was a lot of
books, about 135, which she left with
me as there was no sale for them, and
asked me to see if I cou:a ekÂ»< dispose
of them for her.
"The books are nearly all of them
available for your new library or for
your old one, for that matter, and I
have taken the liberty to address you
on the matter, thinking that your
committee might wish to buy them.
They are most of them in splendid con
dition, nearly new, and all well bound.
REV. DR. LANE'S Suggestions to the Lades' Aid Society,
They Would Live Long and Enjoy Life.
If you care to take them I can let you
have them at a very reasonable figure.
They could not be bought new for less
than J200."
With the Theaters.
OAKLAND, Jan. B.â The freshness
and charm of Bronson Howard's com
edy, "The Henrietta," are perennial.
With Stuart Robson as Bertie the
Lamb, "The Henrietta" comes to the
Macdonough Theater Monday and Tues
day. This is by no means a new play,
but it is one in which Mr. Robson has
made his greatest success and one
whirh the public always wants to Bee.
That the freshness and charm of this
-â¢omedy does not die out lies In the fact
that it* is by far the brightest and, dra
matically, the most effective comedy
yet written.
Proctor's Pleasure Party, a highly
recommended Eastern organization,
opens at the Oakland Theater Monday
evening for a week. Instead of thfi
usual tedious waits between acts, local
specialists will be introduced.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANIAtfY 9, 1898.
THEY DESIRE
LONG LIVES
Ladies of the Church of the
Advent Given Novel
Advice.
Rector Law Publishes Some
Ideas That Are Origi
nal.
With a Church Out of Debt They
Should Live for Two Cen
turies.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
907 Broadway, Jan. 8.
The ladies of the Church of the Ad
vent have decided to do everything
possible to prolong their lives. At
present they are having such a happy
time at their church that the ladies
desire to enjoy it as long as it is pos
sible for them to do so.
Rev. Marshall Law, the pastor, is
encouraging the ladies in their efforts
to prove the truth of the Ralston the
ory that they should live 200 years.
Coming from anybody but one of the
most serious of rectors, the present
ambition of the Ladies' Aid Society
of his church might be considered a
little erratic, but I>r. Law is in earnest.
He believes that there are some things
which will greatly tend to prolong life,
and he has published his views for the
benefit of his congregation and any
other congregation that likes to de
rive advantage from them.
In the first place, the Ladies' Aid
Society has reduced its dues, and
there are to be no honorary members
on the roll. Many of the wealthiest
families in East Oakland are members
of the Church of the Advent, and the
pastor believes that all can pay into
the Ladies' Aid Society not less than
10 cents a month without becoming in
arrears. The ladies are also to be
"like real Mrs. St. Andrews," and are
to go out into the highways on the
style of the Salvation Army and bring
people Into the Sunday-school, the
church and the various societies con
nected with the church.
Each time the ladles meet they are
"to knit, make pincushions and aprons,
drink tea and report and compare
notes and laugh and all be young," so
says Rev. Dr. Law.
They aro also to study the Ralston
suggestions and each try to live two
centuries, "laughing all the time over
a church free from debt, the best
choir on the Coast, a famous pair of
wardens, a lovely vestry, a neat sex
ton, and a rector full of schemes." The
pastor says. "The ball begins to roll
next Tuesday afternoon." and every
body is invited to be present.
Humorous as the rector's notice to
his congregation may appear, the
church has accomplished enough with
the aid of its board of officers, of which
J. J. Valentine is senior warden, to
justify it in feeling very Joyful, and.
having accomplished this much, the
rector desires that nothing should mar
th"ir enjoyment of their happy and
unfettered surroundings.
The mortgage han been burned, the
church recently enlarged and beauti
fied, and all branches of work are In
a flourishing condition, which proba
bly cannot be duplicated, especially
from a financial point of view, any
where on the Pacific Coast.
"Ro let us live 200 years, laughing all
the time," says the rector.
A CARELESS MAN.
Paid Notes and Then Left the
Documents in the Hands of
tl}e Payee.
ALAMEDA, Jan. B.â George Lank of
this place has just learned a lesson on
business methods which at one time
promised to cost him dearly.
Lank is a dairyman, and used to
: buy hay from John Kerwin, who was
accidentally killed in June last. He
paid Kerwin many thousands of dol
; lars, and at times gave him notes for
] considerable Rums. Once he gave him
1 a note for $900, which he subsequently
! paid, but left the note in Kerwin's
hands for a year before it was can
| celed. Some time before Kerwin was
killed Lank borrowed $3vo from him
and gave his note. Shortly before the
fatal accident he paid the note, but
neglected as usual to get the document
back. When Kerwln's body was
searched the note waa found, and, as
it bore no indorsement as having been
paid, the executor of the estate de
manded payment, and, being refused,
brought suit.
Fortunately Lank was able to pro
duce other evidence showing that he
had in fact paid the note, and to-day
Judgment was rendered in his favor.
THE POSTMASTERSHIP.
Another Petition in Circulation on
Behalf of T. W. LeydecKer.
Other Candidates.
ALAMEDA, Jan. B.â A petition ad
dressed to Senator Perkins and Con
gressman Hilborn was circulated in
this city to-day requesting those gen
tlemen to secure the appointment of T.
W. Leydecker to the position of post
n aster of this city, to fill the vacancy
now existing by the expiration of the
term of T. W. Stoddard, Cleveland's
appointee The petition was largely in
tliÂ»' nature of a protest against the pro
test s.'iit tH President M< Kinley by a
number of prominent ladies of this city
against Leydeckert appointment, on
the ground that he was once a saloon
keeper on the San Francisco water
front, and. as they averred, was still
believed to <>\vn an interest in some sa
loon. The present document declares
that Mr. L-y decker has long since
abandoned th<Â» saloon business; that he
is a good Republican and has a good
record as a city trustee; that he is â 
capable bashMM man, and would fill
the position well and acceptably. The
document received many signatures
among business men and politicians,
for it is undeniable that Leydecker is
popular.
It Is understood that if he receives
the appointment <"harles Marston will
be his deputy. Besides Mr. Leydecker
the candidate! f'Â»r the office include K.
1> Uandlet. Dr. J. T. McLean. J. W.
Jackson. M. L. Culver. Offrrge Bew. M.
S. Taylor and T. O. Dani'-lls of the Ar
gus. It is believed that of these the
first -named gentleman has the best
chance for the appointment.
Republican Club.
ALAMEDA. Jan. B.â The annual
meeting of the Alameda Republican
Club will be held in this city on '
> Wednesday evening next at Llnder
| man's Hall. On that occasion the
biennial election of olncers will take

this club with the organization known
as the "Regular Republican Club" of '
this city.
Canytra Club Meeting.
â ALAMEDA, Jan. B.â The Camera Club
had a very interesting meeting last
evening. The reports of the various of- I
â  fleers showed that the society was in a '
, flourishing condition, having over '
fifty-one members and the finances i
healthy. Great interest is taken by
all the members. An outing committee \
was appointed to prepare for a day's
outing In the country, which it ia pro- j
| posed to hold shortly.
To Sell r|arbouroe - Â» Private Library.
ALAMEDA. Jan. B.â When Librarian j
; Harbourne departed so suddenly from
j this city he left behind a library of i
standard works '>f considerable value,
i for which his family has no use. A I
proposition has been made to the peo- |
pie of Pleasanton to purchase it as a ;
nucleus for a public library, which that ;
i town purposes to establish as soon as
j the necessary preliminaries can be ar

Notes.
Dr. P. Brett Morgan is to deliver a

DEATH DUE
TO FOLLY
Constable Scott Is Not
Guilty of Any
Crime.
The Tramp Invited Death by
Flourishing an Empty
Revolver.
â 
The Jury Declares That the Killing
Was Justified Under the Cir
cumstances.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 8.
The Coroner'B jury has exonerated
Officer James Scott of Contra Costa
County for killing a tramp who re
'â  fused arreÃt in a box car last Sunday
night. At the time of the tragedy the
| victim and five others were in a box
| car and when asked to come out one of
them pointed a gun at the officer,
whereupon he drew his pistol and fired
blindly into the car.
Officer Scott was looking for the par
ty of tramps when he came across the
inhabited box car. William Thomas,
chief officer of the ship Pengren, and '
â  Richard Hughes, steward of the vessel, !
: went from Oakland to Port Costa last
! Sunday night. Soon after getting upon |
the train they were assaulted by tramps â 
. and Thomas was severely injured on '
! the head. Officer Scott and Deputy i
i Sheriff Moyles, after hearing of the as- ;
sault, started out to hunt up the hobos.
The whole Bix of them were soon found â 
i and Scott ordered them to come out
I from the car. One of them drew a pis- i
[ tol and threatened to shoot, whereupon
'â  Scott emptied half his revolver into the \
i car. Deputy Moyles went to Scott's as
sistance and five of the men were taken
into custody. This was about 10 o'clock j
1 at night, and on groping around in the ;
darkness in the car the prostrate form
of the sixth man was found. Beneath 1
him was an unloaded pistol, and an
examination showed that one of the of- |
fleers' bullets had entered his brain, !
and although he received medical at
tention he died during the night.
It now appears that the dead man
met his fate as the result of foolish- ;
ness, for the Jury exonerated Scott on j
the testimony that the tramp had j
pointed the pistol at him, and on the
theory that Scott was justified in be
lieving it was loaded. Their verdict is
generally approved.
One of the men under arrest made his
escape by weeping and asking that his
handcuffs be taken off so that he could
help his dying brother. His request was
complied with and he has not been seen
since. The men who are in jail claim
that the act of Scott was unjustifiable
and that this is the second man Scott i
has killed within two years.
The testimony at the inquest proved
i that two of the three bullets had struck
i the tramp who foolishly pointed his un- :
loaded pistol at the officers.
Coroner Curry is anxious to learn
who the dead man was. He went by
the name of Plttsburg Jimmy and his
j arms are heavily tattooed, having upon
them the picture of a woman and two
children, three flags and an American
shield nndnhe letters "J. F." He was
about 30 years of n?p.

A Woroan HÂ«'d for Fraud.
OAKLAND, Jan. B.â Mrs. M. Win
slow of San Jose was arrested to-day
and lodged in the County Jail on a
charge of obtaining money under false
pretenses. The complaint was sworn
to by Mrs. Addie Etts, who charges
that Mr. and Mrs. Winslow secured $100
in cash and a note for $500 without an
equivalent. Some time ago the Wins-
K.-ws sold Mrs. Etts the county right
to a patent medicine. She agreed to
pay $600. $100 in cash and gave her note
for the balance. When the latter fell
due she refused to pay it, claiming
that she had been swindled. Mrs. Win
slow asserts that they sued the woman
and secured judgment. Attachments
were served on Mrs. Etts' property and
money in the bank. In order to foil
this attempt It is claimed that the pres
ent action was taken. Mr. Winslow is
also wanted, and if he returns to his
home in Ran Jose to-night he will be
arrested and brought here.
A POISONER IN BERKELEY
Cbickeos and Dogs Being Killed
by Some UnKnown Mis-
creant.
BERKELEY, Jan. B.â An unknown
chicken poisoner is at work in Berke
ley. I. N. Kierulff of Shattuck ave
nue and Carlton street yesterday lost I
twenty valuable fowls, which had been \
given strong poison of some kind. The j
chickens were of fancy breed and Mr.
Kierulff is very indignant at the un
known miscreant's deed. He offers a
large reward for the capture of the
poisoner.
A valuable dog belonging to A. Her- j
man of Stuart street, in the southern I
portion of town, was also poisoned re
cently. A number of other complaints
of poisoning in the South End have
been received within the past few days
and if the miscreant who has been
guilty of the cowardly acts is discov
ered there will not be lacking deter
mined prosecutors against him.
Couldn't Spell "BerKeley."
BERKELEY, Jan. B.â On the nÂ»w
dating stamps used in the local Post
office the name of the town is mis
spelled â¢Berkley." In consequence the
stock of patience for which genial
Postmaster Al Vinzen is famed is
being t taxed to the uttermost by the
visits 'of Berkeleyans â men, women
and childrenâ who derisively, pityingly
; or indignantly seek to correct his sup
i posed mistake. Postmaster Vinaent
; explains that the typographical mis
take was made at Washington, and
that local mail will have to stamped
"Berkley" until a new dater arrives,
the old one having been destroyed be
fore the error on the new one was dis
covered.

THE X RAY
POINTED TO
THE BULLET
Baldwin Gardiner Is
Relieved of the
Pellet.
Victim of Burglar Stroh or
of the Patrolman Has
a Chance of Life.
A Marvelous Surgical Opera
tion, the Second of Its
Kind Here.
IMBEDED IN THE SPINE.
By the Irony of FatÂ« the Missile
Reached One of the Most
Vital Locations.
People talk of the irony of fate, but
onl-- occasionally do they meet with a
case that seems to justify that much
used expression. When, however, on
Christmas eve a peaceful and unoffend
ing citizen is roused from his sleep by
a midnight burglar and shot in such
a manner as to make death infinitely
to be preferred, then, indeed, one has
some excuse for exclaiming "The irony
of fate!"
.â¢ Such in brief is the case of Baldwin
Gardiner. The story of the burglary
during th^ night before last Christmas
has b"pn told. Whether the hullft tftat
struck Mr. Gardiner came from the
pistol in the hands of Burglar Rtroh or
was the chance shot fired by Patrolman
Murphy is still a matter of some doubt.
The result, so far as Mr. Gardiner is
concerned, is the same in Hther rase.
Almost with the consciousness that he
was hit came the knowledge that from
his chest down he was paralyzed. Phy
sicians were called and Wednesday
morning he was carried from his room
in the hospital to the X-ray laboratory.
Mr. Gardiner was placed on his back
on the table on the X-ray laboratory
5 cent piece having first been fastened
to the fifth dorsal vertebra in order
that a point might be secured from
â¢which it would be possible to measure.
Of course the nickel would throw a
shadow upon the photographic plate,
wjjirh would be easily rcognized and
serve as a landmark.
Dr. Jones developed the plate, the
process of development being identi
cal with the development of sun pic
' tures, and the bullet was found. It
was in the second vertebra below the
one upon which the nickel had been
placed and just a fraction of an inch
to the right of the center of the back
bone.
The news was immediately communi
cated to Mr. (Jardiner and to the doc
tors and a consultation called for that
afternoon. At 4 o'clock Dr. Gibbons.
Dr. Cheney, Dr. Dozier, Dr. Rixford
and Dr. Jones met to examine more
carefully the picture obtained by the
X rays and discuss what might be
done. There was no difference of
opinion among these gentlemen.
They were unanimous in considering
an operation, though it would be an
extremely delicate and difficult one.
For if the bullet had seri
ously injured the cord Mr. Gardiner
would be no worse after the operation
than before, whereas if the bullet had
simply become embedded in the bone,
and caused paralysis by pressure only
upon the cord, its removal and the ces
sation of the pressure might possibly
result in a cure. The chance was
small, but there was a chance.
Only once before had a bullet been
located in the spinal column and re
moved. That was the case of Bernard
Cook, a cook in the San Joaquin Coun
ty Almshouse, who had been shot in
the back by a discharged employe of
the Almshouse.
In that case the bullet was removed
by Dr. L. C. Lane and it was found at
Cut Showing the Position of the EÂ«!let Behind the Spine.
[From a radiograph by J>r. Jones \
To the Editor of The Call: At the request of Mr. Cheney, I, on Thurs
day last, made an X-ray examination of Mr. Gardiner. I found the bullet
located almost in the center of the seventh dorsal vertebra, and judged from
the nature of the shadow that it was immediately in front of the spinal cord.
I so informed Dr. Cheney and the other doctors Interested in the <as-\ and
they decided to operate at once. The bullet was found in the precise spot in
dicated, and was easily removed. The location and relations are very clearly
slaown in the skiagraph, or X-ray picture.
fHLLIP MILLS JONES, M.D
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 9, IS9S.
the time of operation that the bullethad
not directly injured the bundle of
nerves, but that it had been pressing
upon them and that the pressure had
produced an atrophy of the cord, mak
ing a cure impossible. Had the bullet
been removed immediately after the in
jury Bernard Cook would have perfect
ly recovered.
The lesson learned in that case was
applied in the case of Mr. Gardiner â if
anything was to be done it must be
done as soon as possible, before the
!>"ssible pressure had time to do per
manent harm. Thursday afternoon
was decided upon for the operation,
giving twenty-four hours in which to
prepare Mr. Gardiner for the ordeal.
At the appointed time the doctors
were all in attendance. Mr. Gardiner
was given chloroform, and all was
ready for the operation â the second of
its kind that had ever been performed.
Dr. Rixford, who, it had been decided,
waa to do the operating, asked Dr.
Jones to Indicate the spot on Mr. Gard
iner's back, under which he had con
cluded the bullet would be found. Dr.
Jones pointed to the seventh dorsal
vertebra, and without a second's hesi
tation Dr. Rixford made the first in
cision of the operation that was, per
chance. to save Mr. Gardiner from a
living death.
Very little was said as the doctors
stood grouped about the operating ta
ble; a request to a nurse for sponges,
the metallic rattle of the instruments
as the operator reached for the one de
sired out <>f the trays- containing them,
the labored breathing of the patient â
these were about the only sounds.
The nraaclea were separated from the
ridge of bone th;it runs down the center
of the back, and then the wings that
come off on thi> sides of the vertebrae
and form an arch above the spinal cord
were chiseled through. I n a nÂ»oment
the canal wan laid open and the white,
glistening hum h of nerves could be
Been. Slowly and gently the operator
moved his finger over the exposed
cord.
"There is the bullet underneath the
cord," and ;i faint sigh of relief seem
ed to escape from all present.
But the question as to how much
damage had ltt-f-n done was not yet set
tled, and to remove the bullet from its
place beneath the cord would be a
matter of Teat delicacy.
Very carefully the bony opening was
enlarged and the spinal cord lifted un
til a probe could be passed beneath it:
then a pair of fnroeps was introduced
and the bullet grasped. But it did not
move. Gently, very gently, the bullet
was worked from side to side, till it
loosened from its bony bed, and then â
the slightest pull anil it was out!
The next question was, how much in
jury had been done to the spinal cord?
And the answer was not gratifying, for
it showed that something less than half
of the cord had been cut by the bullet.
The irony of fate. If It had only gone
anywhere elseâ just the sixteenth part
of an inch farther forward, and all
would have bef>n well! If it had but
lodged in the body of the bone â or, If
it had gone through his heart, it would
have been much better for Mr. Gardi
ner.
The doctors think there Is little or
no hope; that the damage to the spinal
cord has been too great ever to be re
paired. But they do not say it is ab
solutely hopeless, and yesterday he
was, perhaps, a trifle better. He has
entirely recovered from the operation,
and now. owing to the wonderful dis
covery by Professor Roentgen of these
X-rays, and to ih<> skill and bravery
of the surge<m, Air. Gardiner has ev
ery chance that is conceivable.
The bullet and its position may pos
sibly throw some light upon the vexed
question as to which man. the burglar
or the policeman, did the shoot
ing. The bullet is Â» .3S caliber "short,"
and must have come from a point
somewhat above and directly to the
right of the place where Mr. Gardiner
was standing when shot. It would not
lie difficult to place i man in the saVne
position and see from what place ex
actly the bullet came.
BRILLIANT ENTERTAINMENT
National Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers Gives Its Third Annual
Illumination and Ball.
One of the most interesting and gor
geous entertainments of the season
was given hy Local No. 6 of the Na
tionMl Brotherhood of Electrical Work
ers at Odd Fellows' Hall last evening.
Between tho walls of the big ballroom.
5n sundry forms mysterious to the
layman, were suspended a multitude
of cunning d. vires through which the
beauties and mysteries of that ele
ment called electricity were manifest
ed to the eyes, and its power was man
ifested to the mind, of man. On the
Stage ai tk. west end of the hall a
huge combination of bulbs or rainbow
hues was stationed. Behind it a tiny
wheel, that as it turned hissed and
cast off tongues of fire, with each for-
ward movement, changed the figure or.
the piece it directed. Stars, squares,
prisms and kaleidoscopic combination?
came and went on the figure in in
creasing brilliancy. The most remark
able feature of this piece, which was
designed by W. A. Barstow, was that
all the lights of which it was com
posed burned instantly, the kaleidos
copic effects being produced by a sys
tem of resistance in which the light.
themselves played the parts of coils.
Two more exceedingly brilliant pieces
were designed by Eugene Rush. â  One.
which was used as a center piece, wu
constructed after the form of a corna
copia, the lights traveling slowly from
the base to the apex and back, and a?
they traveled burned stars and shields
nr.d prisms against a dark background
of evergreens. A representation of a
swinging bell, across which the light
traveled and swayed, was another
pretty feature of the display. All of
the small pieces and effects were the
result of the labors of FÂ«-ed Sandefur.

Police Officer John Brownlie
Dismissed From the Force.
The Police Commissioners last night
dismissed Patrolman Johr Brownli>'
from the force for unofficer-like con
duct. As was exclusively told in yes
terday's Call, Brownlie, it was alleged,
took advantage of a weak-minded girl
named Ella Goff. He failed to appear
at the meeting of the Commissioners
although ordered to do so, and after
listening to the statements of the girl
and her mother, the board decided to
relieve him of his star.
Brownlio was represented by Attor
ney Fred Frey, who endeavored to se
cure a postponement of the case on the
plea that Brownlie was ill. The Com
missioners refused to continue the
case, claiming that Brownlie was not
too sick to appear.
The matter of appointing a sergeant

MOST REMARKABLE FEAT OF MODERN SURGERY
NO surgical operation of modern !
times has so startled the mcdi- â 
cal world as that performed !
last September in Zurich, Switz
erland, by Dr. Carl Schlatter. j
This consisted of removing the
entire stomach from a woman by cut- i
ting it from its natural appendages, j
thereby removing a tumor and permit- ;
tins the patient to regain her normal \
health. At present the woman is '
gaining in weight and is able to do
light work.
"It is a wonderful operation," says
one physician, while another insists
that it is simply an exceptional case. !
A third will state that it is due more \
to luck than good management that the
woman lived more than a day or so.
To the lay mind all this seems inco
herent and incomprehensible, and the
question is asked: "Does the removal
of a person's stomach without causing
Paid person's death hold out any hope
for the lessening of human suffering in
the years to come?"
But it is likely that to get .a direct
answer to this from the medical world
would be an impossible task. Here
you may ask, "Why?"
The answer to this is that the medi
cal men ha>e been surprised. A num
ber of old theories have been disturbed
and as yet doctors have not had time
to find out just where they stand.
It has been taken for granted for
some centuries that th.; stomach was
a vital organ equally as important al
though not bo sensitive as the heart. A
trifling wound to the heart will cause
death, but it does so because a trilling

THIS IS POSITIVELY THE FIRST CASE OF COMPLETE EX

All recorded cases are, without exception, instances of par
tial removement. JDrs. Langenbuck, Krontum, Hacken and
M.iydl are on record for performing partial excisions. Professor Schur
rhart of Ptelten removed almost all of a woman's stomach In 1895.
The patient lived for two years* and the autopsy held at her death
showed that from the cardiac stump of a new stomachal pouch with ca
pacity of one pint had been formed.
Rerooval of Stomachs prom Animals.
It has been known for some time that dogs are able to survive the
partial obliteration of the stomach and the loss of its functions. This
Interesting physiological observation was made as long ago as 1878 by
C'zerny and his pupils, Scriba and Kaiser. Indeed, the so-called
"Czerny dog" survived the operation for five years and was then killed
for purposes of anatomical study. The post mortem showed that a
small part of the cardiac end of the stomach had not been excised, and
It was further seen that a small sack had gradually formed from this
remnant and had fulfilled gastric functions.

With the stomach there is a difference, j
This organ can be injured without fa- j
tal results to its owner, for small por
tions of it can be removed without
causing serious results. But it has al
ways been noted that the quantity re
moved corresponded to the health of
the person afterward. The more that
has been removed the greater the
struggle of the individual to live. In
all previously reported cases of surgi
cal operations on the stomach death !
has lesulted after a short time when !
there has been a large quantity of the
stomach removed. Physicians never
attempted to remove the whole stom
ach because the removal of large parts
of it so frequently resulted in death.
It is for these reasons that the Zurich
operation is regarded by many of the
profession as "an exceptional case."
It is said that the result of the Zu
rich operation is the proving of cer
tain theories. For instance: It has
long been believed that the intestines
were of greater importance than the
stomach. Now there can be no doubt
Of it, since it is shown that they can

are also set at rest.

can be realized. To bo handle the pa

pable of being granted by the medical
profession. The task occupied two
hours and a half. The operation itself
was really a simple one. As Dr.
Schlatter describes it, he proceeded by
first making an incision that laid
open the abdomen. The patient was
kept under anesthetics and antiseptics
were freely used. The stomach pre
sented itself in the form of a hard
lump. The tumor was movable.
The stomach was then entirely ex
cised and a small coil of intestine was
united to the aesophagus. This made
a perfect connection between the ali
mentary canal and the bowels. The
joining of the two tissues at the points
of cutting was a most delicate opera
tion. They were bound together with
sutures and great care had to be ex
ercised to so do the work that
perfect healing would follow.
But while this was being done, the
heat of the body had to be kept up and
hemorrhages to be guarded against.
Presses, bands and bandages had to be
used, and the greatest care exercised
to prevent any contamination.
After the cutting and sewing were all
done the organs were allowed to drop
back into their places, the opening in
the abdomen was sewed up, and the
operation was finished. Had there been
the slightest mistake the woman would
have died in a few hours. Had steril
ization not been perfect mortification
would have set in and death followed.
But all went well and Mary Landis
is alive to-day, even though she has
no stomach.
TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE CASE.
BY DR. CARL SCHLATTER.
THE personal observation forming
the subject of this 'paper relates
to a woman 56 years old. In her
case I completely excised the stomach,
even beyond Its cardiac extremity,
and then, restored the continuity of
the alimentary canal by stitching a
loop of small intestines into the lower
end or the oesophagus.

REV.
F. R. FARRAND.
If I had a
million dollars
to expend in
this commun
ity, what
would I do
with it to make
it productive of the greatest good for
the greatest Bomber of people and for
the longest period?
A million dollar seems a big lot of
money. In the hands of a shrewd busi
ness man it might be made to yield ten
\ or more per cent, especially if he take
gome risk in ventures with a part of
it. A million dollars as trust funds
, must be invested as safely as private,
! and so could scarcely be made to yield
more than 4 per cent net.
If this sum were given to me to use

that cancer is hereditary in her fam

pains in the stomach. Medical treat
ment had never afforded her any re

attacks of vomiting were of daily oc
currence. Progressive emaciatipn also
ensued. Several weeks before her ad
mission to the hospital at Zurich a

sufficiently endowed, would result in
the greatest good to the greatest num
ber of people for the largest period.
It is conceded on all sides that the
churches are the strongest moral force
In a community. The "down-town dis
tricts" are being deserted by many of
our churches simply because there is no
money to maintain them there. Every
pastor who has advocated such re
moval of his church would gladly have
stayed if it were possibleâ a million
dollars would just about suffice.
I would take a couple of hundred
thousand, buy a suitable lot in the
midst of the down-town district and
erect a commodious building of brick
and stone, fire-proof. It should have
plenty of light and be adorned with
works of art and other appointments
which tend to the uplifting and refining
of men and women. It should have a
number of cheery rooms, with concert
and lecture hall and auditorium for
preaching services. With the income of
the remaining $^00,000, which at 4 per
cent net would be $32,000 per annum,
I would place the best evangelical
preacher obtainable in the United
States in charge and give him several
assistants as Bible readers, teachers
and visitors of both sexes. I would
have free classes of instruction similar
to the Y. M. C. A., only open to both
sexes. I would have courses of lec
tures, concerts, etc., to educate and en
tertain. To fully elucidate my plan
would require more space than you will
give men, but from what has been said
you can catch the idea. I do not be

est good to the greatest possible num
ber of worthy persons for the greatest
length of time.
In the above statement there are
three factors to be considered. First,
the good itself; next, the recipient;
third, the time. In order that the
greatest possible good might be accom
plished with a million dollars, and at
the same time extend furthest both in
point of numbers and time, it should
be circulated or distributed in different
directions; not all the money should
be spent on one class of people, but it
should be used so as to include all
classes. I think that a large part of
the money, say one-fifth, should be
used for private charity; that is, for
people whose cases do not come before
public institutions. No one has more
of this kind of work under his notice
than a millionaire, to whom all needy
people apply, many of whom do not
care to ask aid from the societies or
the public. The rest of the money. I
think, should be devoted to public ends;
that is to say, should be placed in the
hands of competent men, as a board of
directors, to use for the benefit of re
leased convicts; to set triem on their
feet again and give them another start
in life. The homes for the aged and
disabled, the orphan asylums, the shel
tering homes, the hospitals â all should
receive a portion of the money. Then
I think some of it should be used for
the endowment of manual training
and agricultural schools for poor chil
dren, where they could have a home
to which would be attached this school
wherein they could learn to be aseful
citizens when of age, and I think a
Strangely enough, the tumor was
freely movable. It was readily lifted
out of the peritoneal cavity. Three
rather soft lymph nodes were found at
the greater curvature near the pyloris.
The stomach being diseased in toto a
gastro-enterostomy was impossible. I
at once decided to attempt to excise
the entire organ or take recourse in a
junostomy. I first freed the stomach
from all its attachments at the greater
and lesser curvature. The stomach
was then forcibly dragged downward,
so as to enable me to reach the oesoph
agus. The left lobe of the liver had to
be constantly held upward by an as
sistant.
A Still forceps was next fastened
closely to the cardiac end of the tumor.
Then the stomach was severed direct
ly beneath the oesophageal extremity.
As the oesophageal appeared somewhat
oblique I proceeded to place a small
occluding suture at the gastric wound.
The same steps were now repeated at
the pyloric end of the stomach. I next
mobilized the duodenum as far as pos
sible toward the head of the pancreas.
I next tried to pull the duodenal
opening upward toward the oesophageal
cleft. It was only with considerable
diificulty that the tube could be made
MY CONCLUSIONS IN THE CASE,
Dr. "Wendt was sent to Zurich by several New York medical societies to
specially investigate the Schlatter operation.
WHILE it would be manifestly unfair to indulge in sweeping
generalizations on the strength of the single case so boldly
rescued and ably described by Dr. Schlatter, it seems at least
justifiable to formulate the following conclusions:
1. The human stomach is not a vital organ.
2. The digestive capacity of the human stomach has been consid
erably overrated.
3. Fluids and solids constituting ordinary diet are capable of com
plete digestion and assimilation without aid of the stomach.
4. A gain in weight of body may take place in spite of the total
absence of gastric activity.
6. Typical voir^ting may occur without a stomach.
6. The general health of a person need net immediately deterior
ate on account of removal of stomach.
7. The most important office of the human stomach is to act as a
reservoir for the reception, pulmonary preparation, and propulsion of
foods and Quids. It also fulfills the useful purpose in regulating
swallowed solids and liquids.
8. The chemical functions of the human stomach may be com
pletely and satisfactorily performed by the other divisions of the ali
mentary canal.
9. Gastric juice is hostile to the development of many microbe
organisms.
10. The free acid of normal gastric secretions has no power to
arrest putrefatic changes in the intestinal tract.
11. Its antiseptic and bacterial potency has been overestimated.

COULTERVILLE SKULL
'"â  It is when the Coulterville skull is compared with the Java skull in this
: position that its greatest resemblance is apparent. Note the protuberances above
: ihe eyes â a mark that distinguishes the very oldest skulls from those of a com
v-iparativety modern date.
TWO human skulls and part of |
the remains of a mammoth
have been dug up out of the
earth in the Sierra foothills ;
near Coulterville. The best 'â 
known local scientists are busy
Investigating them, for all th--> signs and \
surroundings indicate that they are of j
incalculable value to the scientific |
\\'>rld.
In character the skulls closely re
semble the famous Java skull, the most
remarkable skull ever found, a skull
whi< h the best authorities claim to be
: ove: rs old and to be the near
â :est. approach to remains of the "miss
; Ing link."
It was only a lucky accident that
preserved the remains of these Coulter
ville bones. Chinese miners uncovered
.;!them near bedrock, and to allay their
;v;:Siiperstitious fears began to throw
:.;them into the river. Before they had
-â cleaned them all out th^ir white over

ize the true value of the bones, but he
.-â¢thought they'd make good-looking
urtosities, so he carried home a num
â J-bier of skulls and what was left of the
and tusks of a mammoth. Later
;,on a s< -i^ntist happened to pass that
vwty. He Instantly saw the value of
the remains from a scientific point of
â  .view, and obtained them for the Acad
ot Sciences. Those Chinese never
knew it, but the bones they so zea
. lously pitched into the river were of
more value than any ordinary pocket
of gold they could have found. They
â¢ -were worth nearer $10,000 than the bit
: Of gold in the gravel near them.
To the ordinary observer there would
be little about these fractured bones to
attract attention, for there are lots of
other bones in the world that look 'ik<:'
them. But the fact that the human
skulls were fÂ«-und together with the
mammoth bones, in th>? same bed of
auriferous gravel, makes them at oneÂ»
of the greatest importance as tending
t-i throw light on the existence of man
in this vicinity during the pliocene age.
A number of s i-ntifie men who have
seen sains declare them to be
of the greatest importance to paleon
tology; in fact, it is a close question
whether they are not of greater impor
tance than any remains that have ever
been found in California, not even bar
ring the famous Calaveras skull.

villp, and in the banks formed by a

f According to Mr. Curtis' story, he
had a number of Chinese working for
him at -hydraulic mining. One morn
irig his foreman came to him and told
Xh--ni that there was great excitement
;.Â«-.rnong the Chinese, as they had struck

Shis one fact is of the greatest im- i
portance.

may be that the bones were once a
hundred feet or more beneath the sur
face.
The stratum where the bones were
found was the stratum of the pliocene
age â the age of mammoths. But grant
ing that the bones were never more
than twenty feet beneath the surface,
it is impossible that they could have
; been buried at that depth by any com
, paratively modern nomadic tribe. To
j have moved the gravel bed for the
surface over which the bones were
spread would h:ive been a herculean
task that California!! Indians would
! not attempt. At the point where the
i bones were found the gravel bed was
: being removed by thc> action of the
; elements, and the indications are that
i the removing process had been going
on for ac<-s.
Judging by the topography of the
j locality, it is most apparent that the
i bones were buried only a few inches
: beneath what was the surface at a
! time when mammoths roamed over
; this country and that the stratum of
1 gravel was ages in being deposited.
Granted that the geological signs
I about the bones are correct, there can
hardly be a question but that the skulls
; are of the oldest human remains in
i existence.
Mr. Curtis secured about forty
skulls. He says they were all exactly
j the shape of those he has just given
ito the Academy. For a time he kept
his collection of remains in his own
I home, but gradually parted with them
j to friends, who wished them for curi
] osities. As time passed his collection
: was reduced to two skulls and a
j mammoth's sluill and tusks.
Seeing that they were likely to be in
jured, and as curio-hunters were con
1 stantly asking for them, he took them
to Coulterville and placed them in the
! Odd Fellows' Hall. As they showed
signs of going to pieces, they were
i varnished with a common varnish,
i This one act has been of incalculable
injury to the skulls, as it has filled
: the structure of the *>one, making it
almost impossible to determine the ex
act amount of organic matter still re
maining in it, if, indeed, there is any.
The skulls and mammoth bones re
mained unrecognized in the hall in
' Coulterville until last June. At this
| time Dr. Eisen of the Academy of Sci
! ences happened into the locality while
on an expedition in search of speci
mens. As soon as he saw the bones he
!at once recognized their value and
i made efforts to secure them for the
Academy. With the assistance of T. J.
! Goodman and Phil Hope, he has at last
: been successful. The mammoth bones
1 and skull are safe in the Academy of
Sciences, where they are likely to re
main as long as humanity has any in
! terest in the peoples of the past.
The finding of the Coulterville skull
and the mammoth's remains is only
â¢ another link in the long chain of evi
j dences of man's existence on what is
! now the Pacific Slope ages and ages
I ago â so long ago that no chronology
can compute it.
Although it is not generally known,
j California has produced more undis
j putable proofs of man's early existence
I than any other part of the world of the

The proof of this would require vol

counted by the dozens. It is not possi
ble that this could be due entirely to
chance.
That man lived in California at the
same time as mammoths is a fact sci
entists no longer dispute. At that period
he was a man living as an animal but
having a superior intellect. Here was
SIDE VIEW OF THE REMARKABLE SKULL UNEARTHED NEAR COULTERVILLE.
While this view of the skull does not show the strong resemblance to the Java skull that the crown view does, it is, nevertheless
most interesting. The large arc of the skull line from the eyebrows back to the apex of the skull shows a lack of brain space
and consequently a low order of intellect. The other marks of peculiarity will most likely open up new fields in the study of
craniology.

The oldest California that has
ever passed the scientific ordeal is
known as the Calaveras skull. It was
found in the foothills of Table Moun
tain some years ago. Its exact loca
tion was over a hundred feet beneath
the surface and with it were also found
some mammal bones that have never
been identified. There were also a num
ber of utensils. The age of this skull

of eminent paleontologists voted on the identity of this skull, and the majority
declared it to be that of a man.
the mammoths scientists claim that it
must be at least 10,000 years old.
In comparison with the Calaveraa
skull the Coulterville skull is of a
much lower order. So, granting that
both belonged to the mammoth age, it
is much older. But how much older
no man can say.
The oldest human skull ever found
on the globe is the so-called "missing

of Java a few years ago by Dr. Eugene
Dubois. Thousands of scientists have
studied it and have given it a place
higher than the apes and much lower
SEALSKIN CARPETS
on
HER PARLOR FLOORS
It has been said that the average
woman is never really happy until she
has a sealskin jacket. If that is the
case Mrs. C. A. Lutz, who lives out in
the Mission, should be the happiest
woman in the world, for she has more
sealskins than she knows what to do
with. That is, she has more than she
knows how to use, as they are gen
erally used by the fair sex of all the
world where the skins can be obtained.
And so she uses them for carpets.
Mrs. Lutz is a pleasant voiced, cheery
little woman, and when 1 asked her to
let me see her wonderful collection she
readily complied and led the way to her
parlor.
"If you had seen as much of seals
and sealskins as I have." she said, as
she saw my look of wonderment, "you
wouldn't be so interested in these."
But I was interested and surprised
with the richness of it all. And who
would not be? Priceless skins were
scattered about as if they were so
much old rag carpet. In the center of
the room there was the skin of a crea
ture that must have been a monster of
his species in his day. About on all
sides were others of different sizes and
beauty. But all were really beautiful.
Some were dark and some were of a
soft brown. All were as soft as the
finest silk, and as they were spread
about the room and covered the differ
ent articles of furniture they formed
a sight of the rarest kind. Certainly
it could not be duplicated in San Fran
cisco.
I asked how many rugs she had, but
Mrs. Lutz shook her head and said she
had not counted for so long that she
really did not know. "You see, I lived
up in Alaska at one time," said Mrs.
Lutz, "and sealskins have become
rather commonplace to me. I really
care very little for them." So you see
one can have too much of a good thing,
even if that thing is such a costly af
fair as a sealskin.
The room itself where the sealskins
are is a pretty little affair, and is fur
nished, perhaps, as oddily as it is car
peted. It is full of surprises, and curios
of all kinds, from almost every nation
under the sun.
Here, for instance, a hideous Chinese
god peers at you in a rather unpleas
ant manner when you come in. No
wonder the Chinese fear their gods.
After you've overcome your desire to
turn tail and run, and look at him
closely you will appreciate at once the
value of a marvelous bit of carving.
The Chinese can carve if they can't
fight.
The mantel is covered with a soft,
pretty, glittering bordering material.
"Pretty, isn't it?" asks my hostess.
"You'd hardly think to look at it that
it is made from the intestines of sea
lions. See these pretty, soft little
feathers on It; these are the feathers
than man. As only the upper portion
of the skull was found, however, there
has always been a possibility that it
might belong to some distinct species
of gorilla. At any rate the greatest
scientists in the world have given it a
disiinct position and have named it
the Philocanthropist.
It is in comparison with this skull
that the Coulterville skull reveals its
most wonderful resemblance. Looked
at from the side the Coulterville skull
shows considerable lowness of forehead
but not more than many other skulls
that have been found. But it is when
looked at from the top that thÂ« strong
est resemblance comes out. This will
bo seen by a careful compfirison of the
two accompanying pictures. The prin
cipal difference between the two skulls
is the greater length of sknll of "the
missing link." The enormous ridges of
the eyebrows and the narro-wness of the
skulls at this point are wonderfully
alike. The heaviness of the eyebrow
ridges in the Coulterville skull give it a
distinct characteristic that cannot be
duplicated in any known skull in Cali
fornia.
Professor Marion of the State Uni
versity is greatly interested in the Coul
terville skull and contemplates giving
much time to studying it and the lo
cality where it was found during the
coming year. "It is the most inter
esting skull I ever saw, from a crani
ological point of view," he said, after
a careful examination of it.
Dr. Gustav Eisen rates the skull as
one of the most important ever found
in California. "That varnish on the
skull is a. little confusing," he said,
when speaking of the matter, "but I
am firmly convinced that the skull is
older than anything that has ever been
found in California."
of the shagg, a very pretty bird that
frequents St. Paul Island. The nat
ives kill them just for these feathers.
It seems rather a pity, too, for there is
very little tuft on each bird. They say
they are the only feathers in the world
that will bend without breaking.
"My husband had these rugs made
while we were at the island. Dr. Lutz
was for six years in the employ of the
Alaska Commercial Company, and the
natives would always do their best for
him. See, they have put his initial in
the center of almost every one.
"I had a box of odd things sent to
me just before Christmas. The natives
were rather fond of my little girl, and
I guess they liked me, too, so every
year they send us a box of things. Here
is a baby seal's head, all ready to be
stuffed. Feel the whiskers; stiff, are
they not? The Chinese mount them in,
silver and carry them for toothpicks.
These baskets please me just about as
much as anything I've received this
year. You know the art of basket
making is dying out now. They no
longer teach it to the young.
"Yes, I've had some novel experi
ences. You have heard, have you not,
that if one can but reach the end of a
rainbow they would surely discover the
fabled pot of gold, too. only I couldn't
take it away. It was this way.
Colonel Murray, one of the Gov
ernment officials, invited my hus
band and myself to go to the seal rook
eries on the island. No one but a
Government official has the right to go
there. Of course, we were only too de
lighted to accept his invitation, and
were soon there. The seals were in
good humor, fcrr they allowed us to
move among them and even to pat
them as we passed.
"It had been raining that morning,
and just as we reached the rookeries
a rainbow formed just over the island.
I walked right to where it ended,
among the rookeries. I found the pot
of gold. The sad part of it was that
although the legend entitled me to the
gold, I couldn't have it. The gold was
in the seals, you see, who were literal
ly worth their weight in gold. Disap
pointing, wasn't it? "
I told her that I thought it was, and
she continued:
"The only ride I had while I was
j there was a ride to Northeast Point,
where the largest seal roo-keries in the
world are. We drove a mule team and
had a jolly time of it. It was an im
: pressing and never to be forgotten
I sight, for as far as the eye could reach
one could see nothing but seals, seals,
j seals. We stayed there all night and
returned home next day."
After looking at a few more curios I
said good-by and took my leave. "Be
sure you call again, and I'll show you
some ether odd things," called Mrs.
Lutz as I descended the stair. G. S.

NEW TERROR OF THE NAVYâ THE TORPEDO CHASER.
WHEN she's moving through

can do is just to lash your
self to a stanchion and stay

Thus, the typical British tar, bronzed
and bearded, comfortably stirring a
bowl of steaming cocoa in the little
triangular forecastle of the Virago, the
little English torpedo catcher, that lay
in the harbor last week, and now on
her way to China via the north.
Though the man was in all respects
the regulation sailor, wearing a seaman
gunner's badge, the forecastle was not
at all shipshape and man-of-war style.
The blue jacket looked strangely out
of keeping with his Burroundings. He
should have been in the foretop of a
full rigged ship of the old school, :i
post which was coveted by every true
sailor, and only gained by the smartest.
Instead of this, thanks to modern sci
ence, with its marvelous mechanical
developments, the sailor was sitting in
the hold of a vessel literally filled with
.machinery. There were no spars to
climb, no sails to furl or ropes to
splice, none of the ordinary seamen
like duties to perform. The forecastle,
though cozy enough, with a cheery lit

the spacious orderliness of th<^ mess
deck of an old fashioned man-of-war.
In fact, it had a distinctly mercantile
look, with its small, round port hofes
and bare iron walls.
Nothing but the bunks were missing,
for the man-of-war sailor, unlike his
brother in the merchant service, never
uses a fixed bed place. And the rules
of the service demand that a ham
mock shall be stowed away during the
day, though, as there are no hammock
nettings, it is a mystery how they man
ege to put the beds out of the way on
this peculiar vessel.

going on deck in bad weather," the
sailor went on. in the intervals be

If I put my sea boots and oilskins on

The sailor, it may be noted, has a
supreme contempt for thÂ»^ stoker; looks
upon him as quite an inferior being,
though as a matter of fact the stoker is
the more necessary individual of the
two. And on the Virago there are ac
tually more stokers than sailors, more
engineers than officers.
If you look around the boat you will
easily see why this must be so. For
the greater part of her length she is
nothing but machinery, just a little
space at each end being left for the ac
commodation of officers and crew. The
deck of bare iron plates is absolutely
devoid of ornament, the open iron rail
ing offers no protection from wind and
sea, the waves roll on board one side
and off on the other just as they please.
There are little round holes, like
coal chutes, all over the deck, and
through these narrow openings yoa
must squeeze to get below. Even the
commander has to go down a hole to
his berth, and then shut the lid
tightly after him for fear of being
swamped.
Not a pleasant craft to live on

yet the officers, with professional
pride, speak most highly of her be

LORD KEL VINS OPINION OF THE "VORTEX" THEORY AND THE EARTH'S AGE.
WHENEVER one hears refer- I
ence made to such ques
as the age of the solar sys
tem, the future of the Â«un. or
the probable length of time
that life has been possible on
our globe, the name of Lord Kelvin is
sure to be mentioned as the authority for
the opinion given.
But for that matter, there is hardly
any other question to which physical
science has application, of which about
the same thing may not be said, for Lord
Kelvin's interests and mental activities
appear to have no barriers short of the
very limits of present human knowledge,
while the original cast of hts thought
is such that almost any topic on which
he touches is sure to reveal novel and
unexpected relations.
It was in reference to one of his spec
ulations, and one that easily takes rank
among the foremost scientific imaginings
of any age. that he very kindly granted
an interview recently. This speculation
has to do with that ever fascinating
question of the ultimate nature of mat
ter.
When Lord Ke'.vin (Sir William Thom
son as he was then) came forward with
his very extraordinary vortex theory It
was bused upon mathematical calcula
tions of that other great physicist. Yon
Helmholtz, which took tangible form in
Lord Kelvin's mind while he was watch
ing the activities of som<i curious little
whirling rings of smoke In the air, simi
lar to those with which every tobacco
smoker is familiar.
Helmhnltz had shown that such a vor
tex whirl once started in a frictionless
medium must, theoretically, gr> on for
ever. The vortex whit la of smoke In the
air of course do not go on forever, be
cause their medium Is not frictionless;
but Lord Kelvin observed that while they
last they exhibit a similar stability, and
though composed of mere wreaths of
smoke, take upon themselves the proper
ties of solid bodies, in virtue of the mo
tion, just as a moving bicycle assumes
the property of upright rigidity. And the
thought came to him that if a vortex
whir! were started In the ether, which
physicist* assume as penetrating space
everywhere, such as an ether vortex (In
finitesimal In size, of course) would have
the properties of a particle of what we
term matter. This thought expanded be

world so regarded it, and took it up with
acclaim, and made it the foundation of :
all manner of other beautiful specula

to every philosophical mind: for it en- |
abled the thinker to reduce the entire j
universe to ether in motion.
One had but to assume a fow different :
kind? of vortices (the simplest of them
circular in form, but others perhaps va- ;

ferent chemical and physical properties i
of the elementary bodies; and in the j
mind's eye, one had In the ether that ul- j
tlmate, unique matter, the foundation 'â 
substance of the universe.
If then a man may take pride in his

author of this theory might well be ex- !

When asked whether this theory ap

Herein lies the great value of these
boats, which are destined to play a
leading part in the naval warfare of
the future.
The torpedo-boat destroyer, or torpe
do-catcher, as she is more commonly
though erroneously called, was devel
oped from the torpedo gunboat, a ves
sel designed to protect battle-ships
from the insidious attacks of the wasp
like torpedo-boats. But the gunboat
was found too slow for the service, and
so, some three years ago, the torpedo
catcher came into existence, the main
idea being a sea-going vessel in which
every other consideration should be
sacrificed to that of speed. She was
first put to a practical test during the
British naval maneuvers of 1895, and
the result may be gathered from the
utterance of a distinguished naval of
ficer who carefully watched the whole
proceedings.
"The impression itTt on my mind by
the maneuvers was that all the pres
ent types of torpedo-boats are obso
lete, and that probably no more will be
built. Hut 1 believe that boats of the
size of the Destroyer will take their
place in every navy, and that competi
tion as regards the numbers owned
will begin. England has the start."

every sea â some are in the Mediterra
nean, some on the Atlantic coast,
others in China, and already there are
two in Pacific waters.
The European nations, though a
long way behind, are following suit,
and I wonder if the people of San
Francisco, prosperous in their huge
coastwise commerce, really realize the
terrible power of the insignificant lit
tle vessel which lay so peacefully in
the waters of the bay last week.
Search the whole of the United States
coast from Cape Cod to the Rio
Grande, from Puget Sound to San
Diego, and you will not find a single
sea-going vessel with anything like
the same speed. In the event of a war
with England the whole commerce of
the Pacific Coast would be at the
mercy of one of these little vessels.
From Esquimau to San Francisco Is
but a distnee of 750 knots, which the
Virago, if pushed to it, could cover in
a day.
The fastest mall steamer which tra
verses the ocean would be helpless
against her, let alone the mere coast
ing boat. Even the record-breaking
China would be easily overhauled by
the Virago, and there would be nothing
for it to do but to surrender, or else go
to the bottom.
It is true that the armament of the
Virago and her sisters is not heavy,
she carries but one 32-pounder gun and
live C-pounders. Put a shell from even
the smallest of these weapons, planted
brate to the extent of becoming com
pletely collapsedâ Just as a tuning fork
can only vibrate to the extent of bringing
its two prongs In contact. Corresponding
in the neighborhood of the engine
room, is quite sufficient to stop any
merchant steamer, while thanks to the
high explosives now in use. two or
three shots would probably send her to
the bottom.
All the battle-ships, monitors, crui
sers or other ships of war which could
be gathered together in San Francisco
harbor would be powerless against such
a little vessel. A clean pair of heels,
is the best of all defenses, and she
would never stay to fight an enemy
of superior force. HÂ«r mission would
be to attack only unarmed commercial
vessels. When a man-of-war with
real guns came along she would sim
ply run away, and seek shelter in her
own port, or with the fleet to which she
was attached.
Nelson, in the old days when his
three-deckers swept the French from
the Mediterranean, u* e -s to speak of
the frigates as the eyes of the fleet,
and in his correspondence he constant

sa>s Professor Dolbear, if the vortex

heat cannot become more excessive.
Now, the physicists have long held that !
there is a lower limit of temperatureâ a â 
so-called absolute zeroâ reached when
the atom altogether ceases to vibrate
and the question has h.ghly interesting
bearings, because it brings into consider
ation no less a problem than the age of I
the solar system. Astronomers and phy- i
sicists are agreed that the sun, the earth, '
and the other bodies of our system are
eoottng globes, and the calculations of the !
age of our system are based on the rate
of loss of heat, an estimate of which is j
derived from direct observation of the
sun in its present relatively cool state. I
These estimates have been made most i
carefully by Lord Kelvin himself, but :
neither he nor any one else thought of j
taking into account the possibility that â 
the original nebulous body which was ul
timately to become our solar system, may i
have had a limited temperature. Yet this \
possibility is a most important one, since
Of course the rate of cooling of any body
depends in part upon Its degree of tem
perature.
T h i s question
Is one that appears
to have had pecul
iar interest for
Lord Kelvin. It
even brought him
almost to the point j
IS THE EARTH
SOLID?
1
of a controversy i
at one time with the biologists (and hia
life has been Eingularly free from contro
versies), because he could only allow
them 100,000,000 years for the existence of
life on the globe: and with the geologists
because his calculations led him to be
lieve that the earth is solid to the core,
and at least as rigid as steel, while they
stood out for a fluid interior.
Hence it was to be expected that Pro
fessor Dolbear's suggestion, based as it
Is on one speculation of Lord Kelvin's,
and tending, if supported, to vitiate the
force of one of his important speculative
calculations, should at once Interest the
author of the vortex theory and the cal
culator of the earth's age. And so It did.
He either had not chanced to hear of the
suggestion before, or else courteously
feigned surprise over it. In either case,
it unquestionably interested him intense
ly; but when it came to the expression of
an opinion as to the validity of Professor
Dolbear's conclusions, that was quite an
other matter.
"It is interesting." he said, "most inter- |
esting; but it is based solely upon the
vortex theory, and the vortex theory t as
I have said, is quite unproved, and itself
can prove nothingâ nothing whatever. We
must not heap theory on theory, dream
upon dream. We must wait and see. If
there be an upper limit of temperature,
experiment may some time demonstrate
It, but the vortex theory cannot prove it
in advance, for the vortex theory Is only
a dream. It can prove nothing."
Thus once more did the vortex theory,
which is the adopted darling of many a
scientific imagination of our day, receive ;
the cold shoulder from its rightful
sponsor.
Of the same
tenor were the
great physicist's â 
comments on the '

with low tempera
tures. Every one has heard that Pro
to predict that in future no British
fleet will take the sea unless accom
panied by several of these handy little
vessels. When the fleet is at sea the
boats â¢will act as scouts, keeping the
Admiral informed of everything that
is happening on the ocean within a
radius of two or three hundred miles.
It win become impossible for a hos
tile force to take the fleet unawares,
and the commander who has the?,:
scouts at his service will be able to
choose between fighting and running
away. And this, under the conditions
of modern naval warfare, is every
thing. The terribly destructive wea
pons with which all battleships are
now armed render the annihilation o{
the weaker force almost a certainty.
No Admiral, in the future, will risk
a battle unless he is certain the odds
are with him. and the only way to in
sure this is to obtain beforehand accu
rate information of the enemy's
strength and movements
If a port has to be blockaded or a
hostile coast watched, the destroyers
will prove equally invaluable. Expe
rience during the British naval ma
neuvers has shown that the small tor
pedo boats now in use can be easily
chased and captured by the destroy
ers. The torpedo boat, it must be re
membered, has no offensive weapon
except her torpedo, and this is design
ed for use only against large vessels
She could not use it. if she would,
against the destroyer, and In the mean
time she has to face a heavy fire from
the guns of a boat far swifter than
herself. Therp will be nothing for it
but to turn and run back to port, and
unless she has a long start, the swift
est torpedo boat now known will not
escape the murd.rous catcher
Practically, therefore, when the in
evitable great naval war comes, and
circumstances render it desirable to
invest an enemy's coast, two block
ades will have to he pstabllshed. The
outer line will consist of heavily ar
mored battle-ships or cruisers, watch
ing for the hostile fieot and ready to
attack it should it attempt to put to
sea. But within this pquadmn ther-^
will be an inner guard, a fringe of
pwiftly moving torpedo-boat destroy
ers, who will make sure that no hos
tile craft, however small, shall issue
from the blockaded harbor. Only by
the merest chance, and at the k
of all risks, could a torpedo-boat is
cape through this line, and in :
tice the attempt would probably never
be made.
For one thing, if a torpedo-boat suc
ceeded in creeping out it is tolerably
certain that she would never succeed
in getting back. Whether her attack
on the battle-ships were a success or
a. failure, the searchlights would dis
close her whereabouts, and the catch
ers would take her under their tender
care.
This one advance In construction has
done more to revolutioniee the condi
tions of naval warfare than any which
has been made during recent years.
The torpedo-boat, once a much
dreaded enemy, has received a blow
from which its prestige will never re
cover. The destroyer, which herself
carries torpedoes and can use them if
necessary, has taken the place of the
mosquito craft, and now it is only a
question which nation can build the
greatest number of them.

fessor Dewar and other investigators
have liquefied the gases, and even re
duced many of them to a solid condition,
producing an almost unimaginable degree
of cold. It having been shown that the
same body changes from gaseous to liquid
and from liquid to solid states, simply 'in
virtue of changed temperature, the ques
tion has naturally arisen as to what will
happen when a body is reduced to a con
dition in which the vibration of its atoms
altogether ceases. The particles of a gas
are so active that they fly asunder, re
duce their activity (that is to say, de
crease their temperature), and they move
freely over one another and assume the
liquid condition, make them still more
quiescent and a solid results. Will there,
then, be another change of state when
they are made absolutely quiescent at the
absolute zero point?
But, regarding this point also. Lord
Kelvin's scientific caution asserted Itself.
"The experiments now being made are
most interesting and most important,"
but as to what they would show beyond
the range of present experiment he de
clared himself utterly unable to surmise.
"We must wait and see," he said.
"We must wait and see!" If every
scientific worker would adopt that for his
maxim how much less there would be of

HER OTHER NAME.
A lady who wanted a servant so
badly that she took one without a
recommendation, or even an Introduc
tion, happened one day to look into a
book which belonged to the girl, and
immediately thereafter went to her
with some uneasiness expressed in her
face.
"Is this your book, Susie?" she
asked.
"Yes'm."
"How is this Lien? When you came
you told me your r>ame was Susie
Stokes, but here in this book is the
name 'Bridget Lafferty.' "
"It's all right, ma'am," said the glrl.k

, In 1853 John Ruskin, the great critic, !

was already accepted in England as the !
leader of the rising pre-Raphaelitic I
school of art. He was a rich man, hay- ]

had been from the first a mistake one !
of those mistakes that are as sad i i
â¢their results as are the consequences 'â¢
of deliberate crime.
At this time John Millais, a young
painter of promise, and at that time a
disciple of Ruskin's school, which he ;
afterward forsook to become the pet of |
Philistia, sought Ruskin's acquaint
ance. The art critic recognized Mil

and often was his host.
Milials was about four and twenty
â¢â¢when he first saw Mrs. Ruskin, and he ]
"was one of the handsomest men that
ever lived â tall, strong and with the :

The young wife, as she first appear

beauty, grace and purity. To his dy-

to obtain thf inside facts concerning
'. this strang" order.
Join it! Could this be accomplished?
Yes.
I learned there were no serious ob
jections; in fact, 1 know now that they
are rather anxious to secure a few

members that these devils might be

like an insidious 'iru^, has been slowly
but effectively destroying; the strength
<'â¢â  th<-- Flowery Kingdom and has re
duced the once powerful empire to a
state of anarchy without a stable form
of government, a condition of affairs
which the acute statesmen of Europe
quickly appreciated.
My first difficulty in joining the so
ciety was encountered in procuring a
sponsor. At last I found one in the
person of an old criminal outcast,
about as tough an appearing specimen
of the Chinese river pirate as ever es
caped the sword of the headsman. It

the realization of his every ideal, and
with the keen, unerring eyes of love he
divined her unhappiness. Ruskin's
temperament and that of his wife were
radically opposed.
The man, ascetic, introspective, stu
dious and grave far beyond his years,
with the temperament often accompa
nied by great literary genius, but still
a temperament to which it is Impossi
ble for normal womankind to adapt it
self. The woman, young, childlike of
nature, gay, ardent, sympathetic and
warm-hearted, full of emotions that
were spontaneous to her and absolutely
repelled because they were unknown to
he!- husband.
The very fact that John Ruskin. the
critic, never doubted his wife's happi
ness until Millais came into his life,
and that as soon as he recognized it
he tcrok steps to repair it, speaks vol
umes for the innocence and purity <>f
the woman concerned. Millais, the
artist, saw with a clearer vision, he
noted ali these conditions plainly
enough, but hÂ»* was an honest young
fellow, and. although his heart almÂ«Â«st
broke at the thought, he resolved to
quit England, where the one woman he
could ever love dwelt as the wife of
another and that man his friend.
So Millais told Ruskin of his inten
tion, and Ruskin recklessly defied con
ventionality by insisting that Millais
should remain by protesting that his
future demanded it, and before the
half-dazed painter realized what it all
must mean he found himself, through
his preceptor's commands, daily at
Ruskin's studio, daily his guest at din
ner. The picture of "The Huguenot
Lovers" was at this time first contem
plated and afterward executed, with
Mrs. Ruskin, at her husband's sugges
tion, posing for the figure of the wom
an.
Millais to the world at large painted

to learn my lesson, that I might be
able to make proper responses to the
questions asked me during the initia
tion ceremony. This was comparatively
easy for me, on account of my having
spent a portion of childhood in China
and thoroughly acquiring the Canton
ese vernacular. After a rehearsal of
two or three days I was pronounced
competent to face the ordeal and in
structed by my mentor that the date
upon which I was to be admitted had
been decided upon.
When the day arrived I was in
formed by the adept that tho night was
auspicious for the ceremony. The
moon was hish and full, and every
conjunction of the planet augured suc
cess. We had arranged for a rendez
vous at a certain store about the hour
of midnight. Here we were met by
two more vicious looking heathens and
I was told that one of them had agreed
to assume the responsibility of be
coming my mother, while his com
panion assumed the part of my god
father. We wended our way through
the odoriferous Chinese quarter until
we arrived at an iron doorway where
my companions were obliged to give
certain signs and passwords quite un
intelligible to me. We were admitted
into a low ceilinged room whose walls
were reeking with moisture.
I discovered here that we had been
preceded by many members of the or
ganization. They squatted on mats
scattered about the floor and appar
ently took no notice of anything that
was going on. Perfect silence was
maintained. Not a smile was visible
on any countenance, and the only ex
pression was the dreadful Oriental
stoicism.
At the western end of the room a sort
of improvised altar had been erected
for the occasion* This was the only.

DIED FROM A KISS .
stronger than even his boundless pas
sion â is John Millais himself as he then
looked.
In the woman's face the painter has
fixed an expression of purest agoniz
ing and affrighted love. All the world
knows the picture as that of the lover
who would not consent to save his life
by tacitly denying his faith. To
those who know the history of the cel
ebrated painting the Huguenot lover
is John Millais, m;m of honor and, by
all the strongest throbs of an honest
man's heart, a man who will die before
he will yield to the temptation that so
strongly beset him.
Millais, with a tortured soul, painted
his own agony Into the face of the Hu
guenot lover. Despite the fact that an
other man sat for the male figure in
the picture, every one who knew the
artist thirty odd years back declares it
to be his own portrait.
As John Ruskin's wife posed to the
artist his secret passion confronted the
bit of furniture observable. I was led
to a corner of the room and asked to
disrobe. After one of my attendants
had carefully s.-rutinized my body in
a fruitless seach for birthmarksâ l
have none â I was informed that I
might resume my trousers only and
prepare to be introduced to the grand
master of ceremonies. If my mentor
wore the appearance *f a pirate this
last mentioned individual certainly
carried the fare of a fiend. He was
pockmarked, and by way of addi
tional ornament wore a huge saber
scar extending from his forehead to
the end of his nose, which gave him a
most sinister expression.
"Have you carefully considered the
step which you are nbout to take?"
asked the grand master.
"Yes, Reverend Scribe," I responded.
"Are you ready to storm the Great
Wall?" was his next question.
"Quite ready, Reverend Scribe."
"Have you been prepared with wea
pons?"
"Not as yet."
"Have you been born of blood?"
"Not as yet."
"How can a child be born without
a mother?"
"My intended mother accompanies
me, Reverend Scribe. She stands upon
my left and my godfather stands upon
my right."
"Are you ready to become a blood
brother?"
"AH ready, Reverend Scribe."
"Then let thy mother proceed to shed
the blood of maternity."
At this juncture the yellow-necked
scoundrel who was about to take upon
himself the serious task of becoming
my godfather led us to the altar before
mentioned, where I noticed the various
insignia of the order. There were
sheaves of corn, symbolical of plenty,
dishes of sugar, that we might eat
thereof and remove afl bitterness from
our mouths and our hearts as well; a
dish of oil, that we might not be with
out light in the future, and a bowl of
vinegar, in which our blood might as
similate.
The Chinese elected as my godfather
stepped to the altar, took a needle from
the altar cloth, punctured the end of

vainly tried to hide even from herself.
The man and woman looked at each
other and knew that :n this world
there was paradise for them in a won
derful transcendent low; knew they
were by every law of nature Intended
for each other, and knew that it could
not !Â»â .
ESuphemia Ruskin believed her
wretched secret safe in her own keep
ing. She was a good woman. She
knew she lÂ«.-ved John Millais. and she
long hml known that her marriage to
Ruskin was a mistake for which she
must suffer a penance that would only
end with life itself.
She determined to conceal her
wretchedness and to do her duty by
her husband. The fust step toward
this end was to banish Millais or at
least to avoid seeing him.
The picture of the Huguenot lovers
was almost completed. On the morn
ing of the last sitting Mrs. Ruskin, to
bf-cran to flow quite freely, dipped the
bleeding member into the vinegar,
stirring it about, after the manner in
whidi one uses a flnger-bowL My mas
culine mother repeated the same per
formance, after which all the brc/thers
in turn present did likewise.
Then each returning to the bowl,
dipped his wounded finger therein.
placed the same in his mouth, and
sucking it dry of what fluid may have
adhered thereto exclaimed in a loud
tone, "Thou art my blood brother!"
It was now my turn to go through
the performance. I had studied medi
cine in my youth ami realised that this
was anything bui antiseptic treatment.
What was to be done? Refusal meant
instant expulsion, with possible vio
lence. At this moment my Yankee in
tuition came to my roseue. While my
hand was resting idly on the altar
cloth my attention was suddenly at
tracted to the bowl of oil. A quick
glance assured me that I was unob
served by the brothers, as each head
was bowed in deference to the solemn
ity of the occasion. In a moment my
finger was in the oil. Another moment
and I had performed the disgusting
operation. The coating of oil on the
finger had precluded any possible
chance of the other fluid clinging
thereto. With great fervor I shouted,
"I am thy blood brother."
"Ho" (good), exclaimed the brothers.
In chorus, raising their heads.
Again I was led before the grand
master and instructed to "kow tow"
three times to that dignitary.
I was next informed by the grand
master that my personal courage was
about to be severely tested.
I had noticed in the interval during
our conversation that about twenty
of the members had formed themselves
into two military lines. Kach man j
grasped a razor-edged Chinese sword j
of cumbrous pattern. A furtive glance |
convinced me that these weapons were
not mere playthings: they appeared to j
have been intended for active service. ;
For the first time a feeling of regret j
for my action crept into my mind.
Here was I in a noisome cellar, sur
rounded by a horde of the most merci
less of all human beings, confronted
.with theit barbarous -weapons and be-^
whom Millais had hitherto never spok
en a word of love, stood by the can
vas, looking long and earnestly into the
face of the Huguenot lover. Millais
and she were alone. The woman raised
her searching eyes from the painting
to meet those of the painter. In that
instant both recognized the love they
thought could never know fulfillment.
Millais opened his arms and took the
woman t<> his heart in a long embrace
which he honestly meant as a farewell.
For days after Mrs. Ruskin did not
see Millais. She avoided him in every
possible way. John Ruskin, silent and
taciturn, studied the painting. "The
Huguenot Lovers." What he had not
seen in the eyes of the living man and
woman he recognized in the eyes of the
painted figures. In the expression of
the heart-broken faces of the Hugue
not lovers Ruskin saw the whole truth.
Then John perft-rmed an act of su
premest wisdom, of magnificent cour
age. He neither raved nor shouted
yond possible call of Christian aid. I
was told that I must walk between
tliese files and that as each member
was passed his weapon would fall upon
my naked shoulder. This was to prove
that disloyalty, on my part would be
met"- with summary punishment. It is
needless to say that I ran the gauntlet
with safety,- for as the cutlasses fell
the flat sides were turned toward my
person.
â¢ Facing the ' grand master for the
third time I â¢ was informed that I
would be instructed as to my duties
toward my. brothers of the craft.
"Should a brother fall by the wayside
either through sickness or violence,"
spoke the Reverend Scribe, "it shall be
your duty to assist him. both with
your purse and your right hand. The
sign of distress is clapping the hands
three times above the head. Upon this
manifestation you will hesitate and
hold yourself in readiness to do battle
with the coming enemy. Should the
brother exclaim, 'Ah ga lah!' (strike
him) do not proceed. Should he ex
claim "Urn, ah! (do not strike) you
must assist him with every means at
your command. You must interpret
each expression the reverse of its
actual meaning.
"Know you' that our society is most
potent and its brothers inhabit every
quarter of the globe. Wherever your
steps may carry you, there you will
also find the true heart and the strong
arm of the Gee Kung Tong. Bear also
in mind that while the Gee Kung Tong
protects, it also punishes, and should
you prove traitorous to our cause, your
blood shall pollute the soil of the land.
Be you where you may, the Gee Kung
Tong will find you out.
"Upon entering a strange residence,
or place of business, you shall deport
! yourself â¢as follows: When asked to
I drink tea, you must grasp the cup with
I your index, second and third fingers,,
allowing the fourth finger to rest be
: neath the bowl.
- Without a scrap of parchment or
i any printed reference the â¢ Reverend
Scribe continued to outline the objects
of. the society. Many of his instruc
tions as to diet, deportment, etc., were
trivial, but a few <5f the more import
ant paths, .which were emphasized by

the Life of Lady
Millais.
nor vilified his wife. He neither sus
pected her honor nor that of the man
who was her lover, and he did every
thing in his power to make them hap
py. He deliberately sacrificed his own
happiness.
He gave up his most precious treas- '
ure â the woman wbcae happiness was
dearer to him than his own. Quietly '
and without heroics Ruskin told his .
wife that he had divined her secret.
He desired, he said, above all things
that she should be a happy wife. He
could see that the love he had had not
been so fortunate as to evoke in her
she gave to the man whose character
and attributes he believed honestly j
were worthy (rf it. He Insisted upon a I
divorce, which he himself would under- j
take to secure, and he was as good as
his word. Three months after the de
cree was granted Miss Euphemia Chal
mers was married to John Millais. The
bride was given to her husband at the
altar by John Ruskin.
Stories of love usually end with the
marriage ceremony. John Millais' love
history really began with his bridal
day. It ci.-ntinued uninterruptedly un
til the gates of eternity opened to re
1 reive his beautiful spirit. For over
thirty years Millais and his "EfÃe."
as he called his wife, lived together in
wedded love and happiness that should
make the cynics of the hour bow their
heads in confusion. Mrs. Millais was
her husband's idol. He made no secret
of his admiration for her, and a quar
ter of a century after "The Huguenc-t
Lovers" was familiar, Millais, in the
mean time having achieved immense
wealth and distinction, declared that
he sometimes wished he could get away
from every one else for the rest of his
' life, so that he could '"just be alone
with Effie, his sweetheart."
Many beautiful children came to the
Millais, and each one was or was not
in his father's eyes a beauty if a girl,
, c-r a fine fellow if a boy, by the one
i standard of excellence and loveliness
; accepted by Millaisâ a resemblance to
| the mother. The beautiful Millais
children are supposed to have suggest
; ed to Dv Maurier the touching refer
the use of properties befitting and
symbolical of the occasion, were most
expressive and significant.
Placing my right hand upon the pit
of my stomach, where, according to
Chinese anatomy, the heart is located,
I made oath that I would observe the
instructions of my godfather during
the term of my natural life and rigidly
live up to a hundred and one minor
rules for the guidance of blood broth
ers.
The grand master reserved his most
significant injunction for the last. As
suming that I had been sufficiently
impressed by his previous admoni
tions and by the oaths already taken,
he declared that my mind was now
ready to absorb the fundamental prin
ciple of the order. He solemnly said:
"Mark well, these are good words.
Can the child instruct the parent? No!
Then listen. Open the heart as well as
the ears, that my words may sink deep
like the rice seed and produce in
plenty.
"For centuries the central kingdom of
the earth (China) has been ruled by the
dastard Tartar, he who claims to be
the son of the Sun, but his tongue lies
ten-fold. Shall we, the children of the
great masters, the students of Confu
cius, the oldest of all peoples, born in
the cradle ol nations, submit to the
rule of these upstarts?
"The Ming dynast , whose memory
we venerate, lost it; power through
treachery. After his cruel war upon
our peace loving race, the merciless
Khan (conqueror) deceived the great
astrologer of China through his lies
and sweet talk. When attempting to
enter the Eternal City (Peking), he
was met at the great gate, of which
this altar is symbolical, by the royal as
trologer, a man of great learning, who
spoke thus:
" 'Great general, what do you wish?'
" "1 wish to enter the gates of your
fair city,' he replied.
" "And what might be your business
within the walls of our city?'
" 'Mine only desire is to pursue mine
enemy. I will not harm your people.'
"'O Sir General,' replied the as
trologer, 'I read upon thy countenance
the lines of the conqueror.'
" 'Fear not, O reverend scholar. I
come not to conuuer* but to punish the
ences in "'The Martian" about the
transcendently lovely family of Barty
Josselin.
If Millais adored his beautiful wife,
she in turn idolized her talented hus
band. For many years the Millais were
considered the handsomest couple in
England. Millais was a magnificent
looking fellow, six feet tall, with fine,
regular features, a smile of extraordi
nary sweetness, laughing: eyes and an
air of tremendous vitality and enthu
siasm.
When death menaced the great paint
er Millais was kept in ignorance of the
malignant nature of the cruel malady
which was to destroy him. Mrs. Mil
lais was informed, that she might take
warning and protect herself from the
infection, for Millais was stricken with
cancer of the throat in a virulent form.
The physicians who attended the
painter ttrld his wife of her peril, and
insisted that she should promise not to
approach the patient. No sooner had
the doctors left after giving her this
intelligence than she went to her hus
band's bedside, bent down and deliber
ately kissed him.
The wife knew that with her
kisses she courted a most agonizing
death. It was the death her beloved
must suffer. She had shared his life;
they had been one in everything; she
resolved that he whom she loved better
than life should help her to the death
she chose because it was his.
So day after day as Millais lay dying,
his still lovely wife ministered to him.
"While the attendants were near she
did not press her fond lips to her hus
band's. When they were alone she
would kiss him and lay her lovely face
by the side of the agonized one, and re
peat over and over again to him the
story of her love.
Millais died and the world grieved at
its loss. Little was heard of the widow,
save that she was broken-hearted.
A few days ago the news was receiv
ed that Millais' widow had entered in
to eternal rest; that she had died of a
cancer of the throat contracted delib
erately in caring for her husband.
So ended their life's romance.
traitor of the coward heart who had
not the courage to do my bidding and
has sought a refuge within your sub
lime city. I will first make oath, O
Sir. My hand is upon my neart. Should
my avarice ever induce me to take ad-
Vantage of thy kindness; should J ever
attempt to rule your people, may they
assume the shape of animals, may they
wear a badge of disgrace, as a constant
minder to the great general of his
perfidy. All is spoken; may I pass?'
" 'Pass, son, and may thy mission be
peacefully accomplished.'
"He lied, that conqueror, as all Tar
tars must lie," continued the grand
master, "and within three days he
was seated upon the throne where his
mangy spawn rule to this day.
"Hence the queue worn by our race
in semblance of the tail of the animal,
and the flowing sleeves of our dress,
that when we kneel in worship they
fall about our hands and take shape
like the ltoof of the horse. These
badges must we wear till the return
of the true rulers of our land.
"We of the Gee Kung Tong are the
sons of the soil who have sworn to
wrest our fair land from the hands of
the invader. You are our brother.
Again listen well. We reach north,
south, east and west. Our member
ship is constantly multiplying. The
time may soon come when we must
strike this upstart race of rulers on
the throne of our country. Hold thy
self in readiness to strike with us."
The finale was most expressive.
Standing on a flat stone before the
altar, I was handed a small bowl con
taining a gill of chicken's blood. Rais
ing this with both hands above my
head, I repeated after the grand mas
ter the following oath:
"Should I prove untrue to my
promise, may my life be dashed out
of my body as I now dash the blood
from this bowl."
At the conclusion of tho oath I
hurled the bowl to the floor, shattering
it to pieces.
So it was I learned the secret of the
members of this worldwide powerful
society that is trying its mightiest to
destroy the present rulers of China.
Can they do it?

cation of their soi.?. Mr. Corbin, -who
states his case with remarkably lucidity,
takes three great English schools as Typi
cal of the system which prevails across
the Atlantic. These are Winchester,
founded in 1357, Eton in 1440, and Rugby
In 1."57. Of course the great antiquity of
these institutions has given room for de
velopment on the broadest scale; the
greatest of all masters, experience, has
molded their constitutions on lim-s
which the teaching of centuries has
proved most effective.
Mr. Corbin, after a careful study of
each of these schools, finds little but
praise for their methods. Many of the
features which to American parents
seem most objectionable are shown to be
really beneficial to a boy's character.
Take for instance the practice of fag
ging, universal at all the great English
public schools.
"In the past, to be sure, the system of
fagging was often grossly abused; and
even to-day it Is. like all good institu
tions. Liable to abuse, yet altogether too
much has been said ab<- ;r; r Its tyranny
and brutality. Most snmll boys are glad
enough to be with the big b
senior who plays football br rows well
may have as many youngsters to wait on
him as he cho
There Is sound common sense in these
remarks, and to illustrate his point of
view Mr. Corbin revives a good story
about Lord Rosebery. which Will bear rep
etition. Speaking at a public meeting last
year the late Prime Minister of Eng
land turned to the chairman. Mr. Ack
land. the Minister of Education. "It is
a "long time since you and I. Mr. Chair
man, first met. I have always been a
little under your presldence, because I
began aa your fag at Eton, and I little
thought, when I poached your eggs and
made your ten, that we were destined to
me.-t under these very dissimilar eircum-
Btar.ces."
There onn be nothing very wrong in a
system which leads to such soundly Sen
â¢ ocratlc results. T:i.ke the pplrlt which
prevails at Eton, the most aristocratic
: >of all English schools. "We must aâ '
rÂ»it." writes Mr. Corbtn, "if we are hon
est," that in any given class there is apt
to be more democracy in England than
with us. If an Eton boy is a gentleman
by birth and instinct he need be nothing
mor--. At Oxford or Cambridge LcTd
80-and-Po may find his way where plain
J3o-anri-So cannot go, but Englif-h school
boys refuse to give t\ay '.n more Lords
and Earls. A tradesman once told me of
the experience of the little Earl of Blank,
- who used to present hiÂ»> card when buy
'lng things. The other boys found It out
and followed him from shop to shoe and
hooted him every time he did it.
As often as not one gets to know a fel
low pretty well before finding out that
he has a title. The little Princes of
Coimaught. and even the Duke of Al
bany, will boil their own kettles for tea
and i!" duty as fag like any one else;
and as Inferiors and as captains they
will be judged by the same standard a.s
their school fellows. Jt was not only on
the playing fields of Eton that the bat
tle of "Waterloo was won, it wus in the
school rooms and houses as well."

THE GENTLE COWPUNCHER.
ltx McLEANâ By Owen Wlster. New
Tork: Harper & Brothers. For
by A. M. Robertson.
Apparently the true type -of Western
cowboy, or cowpuncher. as Mr. Wister
rails him, has not been clearly fixed by
the romancists who have made him their
theme. Otherwise there could hardly be
room, in the realms of realistic fiction,
for characters differing so widely as
presented by Dan Qulnn and the
author under notice.
Everybody knows the cowboy who
carves his ruddy, bullet-strewn path
through the pages of "Wolfvillo"; but
Mr. Winter's cowpuncher Is a being of
a totally different nature. In a series of
half a dozen loosely connected stories the
author has given us rather a pretty pic
ture of a gentle, sensitive creature whom
cruel fate has unkindly forced to mas
querade in the guise of a cowboy. For
Lin McLean, if he is not highly educated,
at any rate talks fairly good English; he
does not swearâ at least, not In the pages
of the book, nor does he make a habit
of painting the town a bright vermi'iou
hue whenever he enters it.
In his capacity for pathos and generous,
unexpected deeds of self-sacrifice he re
minds us of Bret Harte's Jack Hamlin
and Tuba Bill rolled Into one and set
down upon the Wyoming cattle ranges
Instead of In California. The book is
well worth reading if only for its de
scriptive power and its many realistic
.s of rude Western life.

TWO WORKS ON CHILD STUDY.
A MANUAL OF MENTAL SCIENCEâ
By Jessie A. Fowler. New York: Fowler
& Wells Company.
Phrenology is nowadays no longer as
sociated with quackery and charlatanry,
but lias evolved into something like a
science and is well worthy of study. Mrs.
Fowler haa written a book applying this
science to children, claiming, with a cer
tain amour: 1 i f iv.-son. that for proper
instruction teachers must understand the
pupils and their inherited tendencies. The
work is esp' dally adapted to meet the
neeOs of the many teachers who nre in
terested in mental science and who are
Ml king assistance in the pursuance of
this study. Numerous Illustrations
and charts nre given, likewise explana
tions for cultivating and restraining the
needful faculties by a simple knowledge
of the elements In each mind. The book
will also prove of incalculable value to
those who have taken up phrenology' as a
pastime or as a means of earning their
bread and butter.
CHILDREN'S WAYSâ By James Sully.
New York: D. Appleton & Co.
The awakened interest in the young and
their training presages well for the future
welfare of the race. There have hitherto
been too fey.- writers like Mr. Sully, who
has made child-life a study and whose
advice concerning the education of chil
dren is well worth listening to. We
know very little about the little ones, and
Vhe tendency to classify them together Is
as hurtful as it is general. Before an
attempt can be made to properly edu
cate them nnd broaden thoir minds, ac
curate kni to th*> cause of thel|
dreamirps nn<l wiiims is absolutely neces
sary. That tho number of failures in the
world is so large is mainly due to the
fact that so little attention is given to
children as such. Their actions are
either misconstrued pr permitted to pass
unnoticed. The result of this Is that the
chilil. while imbibin? a certain amount of
Information mostly unsuited to his needs,
develops on lines of his own. The sooner
this fact. Is recognized, and the sooner
teachers and parenrs consider their chil
dren intelligently, the better it -will be for
the world in general.
ART DISGUISED.
TTIK DECORATION OF TTOT-SEPâ By
Edith Wharton and Oprlpn I'ndman Jr.
Charles Scribner's Sons, New York.
1897.
That ther* Is truth In the old savins
about a book not being judged by it*
binding Is abundantly proved by tha
publication of this most artistic work.
How Messrs. Soribner ever allowed such
a book to jÂ»o out Into the world with
such a binding Is beyond comprehension.
Within, the volume is full of delicate art
BUSBMtlons, beautiful Old World furni
ture and all the refinements of cultured
liff. Without, it is cased In the shab
biest and commonest of paper bindings
and marbled papers, of all horrors, at
that. But leaving the exterior of tlwi
volume, after this brief comment, alone,
one finds In it much to satisfy one's
craving for the beautiful. Furnishings
of every- epoch during the last 800 years
are illustrated by finely executed plates,
ranging over an immense variety of sub
jects, from an Italian Gothic chest to *
French borgere of the Loull XVI period.
The authors, who take aÂ«Â« their motto
Henri Mayeux's axiom. "Uttfl f"rme dolt
etre helle en elle-meme et on ne doit
jatnals comnter *nr le decor npplique
pom en sauver les imperfections," have
a great de.nl thai 1s Instructive to sny
about the true Inwardness of household
decoration.
Their main contention is that archi
tectural features should not be subordi
nate to artificial ornament, that mere
superficialities such as lace curtains and
flimsy upholstering work should not be
allowed to hide from sight and render
valueless the true features of a. dwelling.
In other words, degenerate modern taste,
has led to a severance between the ex
terior and the interior of a house. "We
no longer. In designing a room, consider
proper proportion and the relation of
voids to mass, but rather place re
liance on cheap portable hangings to
remedy all defects. Unfortunately for
this contention, expense has become a
serious factor in modern life, and the
average householder cannot, if he would,
afford to live up to these ideals. And as
to the builderâ well, he is utterly hope
less, it will take a good many volumes
of such admirable teaching to compel him
to realize his duty toward the interior of
the houses he constructs. Still, this vol
ume, with its fine letter press and beau
tifully engraved plates. is a step in the
right direction, and if it only influences
the minds of a few wealthy people, who
can afford to accomplish its hiph ideas, it
will do something toward relieving the
barbaric crudeness of the average Amer
ican home.
A POEM OF THE YEAR.
THK WOOING OF MALKATOON'â By

Pros. For sale by A. M. Robertson.
Price ;
One of the most handsome of holiday
books published this year is entitled
'â¢The Wooing of Malkatoon." by the au
thor of "Ben Bar." Mr. Lew Wallace's
ntanreloaa ability to portray with
graphic v<n East<-rr. historical *cenea is
noticeable in his latest work. "The
Wooing of Malkatoon" is a poem full of
rich Oriental imagery. Jn It the author
relates how the great othman loved a
beautiful girl. Mala l how his
love for her spurred him into founding
the Ottoman empire. The lines contain
many beautiful thoughts and are
markedly free f roi i - is, the
lore affair of the two characters being
of the most Ideal nature.
The SCCQImI poem in the book is entl-
Ued "Commodus." Herein are related
the doings of one Mat. raw, an outlaw
who sought to rid Rome of a tyrant
it, but perished li the attempt. A
different feeling pervi 3 a this poem, with
its clash of arms, is meetings in dark
("â¢erman forests and r'<Â°tti n es !n the Im

poem is somewhat I'.oody, but is thor-
Ing vith the times, and
the death of the outlaw is told in a pe
culiarly powerful manner.

of workmanship in every respect.

of Kentucky gentleman, of good birth
and family tradition, and finely equipped
by education and Influence for the public
career on which he is fairly launched when
the story opens. The first chapters bring
the reader into the thick of the interest,
the fierce discussion between Stallard and
M;irshall in the Legislature, in the pres

suggesting the sentimental complications
that speedily follow.

Is the first work of Its kind ever pub
lished, and as the author has been pre
raring it for over twenty years it is not
likely that any points of value to the
farmer have been omitted. The fact is
well known that Eastern gardeners have
found their own methods fail absolutely
when applied to vegetable raising in this
State. Climatic conditions are different
here, and the soil has to be differently
treated before it will yield the best re
sults. These matters are dealt with
thoroughly in the present work. Besides
devoting a chapter to every kind of vege
table known and the beat method of rais-
ing them. ProfessorWlckson also deals with
the important questions of irrigation,
drainage, fertilization, garden location
and arrangement, cultivation, weeds, the
planting season and propagation. The
completeness of the work is. therefore,
self-evident, and it will prove of value
not only to the vegetable-raiser on a
large scale but also to the large number
of people who cultivate these products

The author of "Gloria Victis" is the

In this essay the author sets out his
objection to the doctrine of Justification
by faith as preached by Martin Luther.
It is a sharp readable criticism of ortho
doxy and episcopacy by a liberal-minded
writer. Written in an attractive, clear
and forcible style. The arguments are
powerfully and logically stated and the
author subjects the various religious
creeds and systems to a rigid analysis,
treating them with remarkable impar
tiality and with a degree of justice rarely
mot with in the doctrinal and theological
discussions of the day. Such little jour
neys into the fields of religious contro
versy are of more than ordinary- Interest
and contain lessons which every one can
study to advantage.

Miss Carey's forte lies in her power to
write healthy stories for girls Just enter-

those who like a clean story told in a

the Inhabitants of the village of Sandi

everything is made to turn out well.
Tragedies are not confined to great cities,
and unhappy poople are to be found in
the best regulated of the world's hamlets.
These facts are accentuated by Miss
Carey, who also teaches the lesson that
Providence watches over men and women

those who are meant for one another will

A CHARMING LITTLE ROMANCE.
A CAPITAL COURTSHIP-By Alex

Scribner's Sons. Price $1.
Mr. Black's latest story might well be
termed a study in realism. The book
teems with Interesting characters, all of
whom speak and act as they might in
real life. A healthiness of tone pervades
the little volume, and although the plot
of the story was originally written for
oral delivery and has been recast for
publication In book form, It has lost none
of its strength by the treatment. The
tale is a capital one from start to finish,
and the little love comedy runnlr.a
through it is most cleverly told. The
illustrations, being the same as those
used in Mr. Black's "picture play." are
probably the best of their kind that ever
embellished a story. In its get up the
book is faultless, the letterpress showing
clearly on fine paper and the binding be
ing unique.

sale by Payot, Upham & Co.
In her latest story Miss Mann has
drawn a graphic but unhealthy picture
of English life, which will undoubtedly
appeal to a large number of morbid
readers. The book deals with a mis-
mated couple, an unscrupulous husband
who permits his wife to drown so that
he can marry another, an unfortunate
lover, and a woman vhose affections
ultimately prove stronger than her
principles. The chapters, however, are
of uniform interest, and the writer shows
her capability of spinning a story with
ease and evenness.

SARAH GRAND HITS BACK.
The author of "The Heavenly Twins"
and "The Beth Book" has turned upon
her critics. The Saturday Review, the
Athenaeum, the Spectator, the Academy
and the London Times have been busily
roasting "The Beth Book" with appella
tions such as: "the worst drivel yet." "a
putrid garbage heap" and "woman's
worst offense." The review in the Daily
Telegraph Is the one, however, that elicits
rejoinder. From Cambo (Basses Pyren
ees}, under date November 22, she writes
to the editor as follows:
"Sir: My distance from home makes

"What was that?" asked the inter

Mr. May wcrks best when he is out
of London. Besides his regular work
for Punch and the Graphic, he has an
I engagement to illustrate an edition de

LIFE AND
SERVICES
OF JOHN DOE
S Hippocrates is honored as the founder of medicine,
so John Doe is esteemed as the apostle of litigation.
f I Paeans to his praise have been sung with equal
* fervor by legal acolytes in Justice Courts and by the
high priests of the law, who in its greater temples,
keep the fire of litigation, like vestal flame, forever burn
ing.
How many suitors, under the inspiration of this hon
ored name, have been incited to deeds of litigation, and
either partially ruined by losing a case, or completely
ruined by winning one. For is it not recorded that when
the intelligent but litigiously inclined citizen hesitateth as
to the expediency <>f paying a lawyer $10 for the possibility
of collecting $"., and the probability of losing $!,">. what
name is more efficient wherewith to conjure his unwilling
purse, or whet hifl almost blunted purpose, than the name
of the levered Doe?
What though a grateful but impecunious bar have
failed to erect in his honor stately columns vxd figures of
marble, his name shall t.-vor endure in the grander columns
and figures Â f the bill of costs.
What wonder that the names of those reporters who
have recorded his occasional triumphs and manifold de
feats, the names of Jewb & Syme, Golbolt. Skinner, and
de Gex & Smale are as household words upon our lips?
What law student who has ever read for the first and like
wise the last time those legal treasures of the past can
fail to recall the leading case of John Doe v. Omnes, an
action of ejectment, brought by John to recover posses
sion of the earth, with damages for its use and occupa
tion?
Perhaps the most succinct and Interesting report of
that entertaining case is in Bacon's extracts, though many
prefer Pond's extract. Quoth Bacon, in the former trea
tise, "After hearing the argument in this case, the Court
as usual, divided; but the Judges, while they /ail to agree
upon every other point involved, were unanimous in the
conclusion that plaintiff should be amerced in damages by
way of costs." Thus Doe established the great prin
ciple of law, which has since stood as the very corner-
Etone of its temple, viz., the liability of unsuccessful suit
ors for costs.
An author, whose name is. to the speaker, unknown. In
his "Commentaries on the life of John Doe," a work which
is not yet in print, informs us that prior to the age of
eight years John Doe gave no evidence of the possession
of extraordinary ability, and that he never gave such evi
dence afterward. From which circumstance he argues
that in the early stage of his existence. Doe was slow to
rise. However this may be, it is certain that the days of
his youth wore full of minor events; and that he spent
most of his time in courts, rather than in alleys.
The first unrepnrted action wherein Doe appeared as
a litigant was in the celebrated case of Doe v. Kid wherein
It appeared that the defendant promised that he would
whip him, the said Doe, as soon as he caught him coram
non judice, or outside of court. The defendant kept his
word, and Doe sued him in trover for keeping it wlt.-n
he had given it to him. In that case the court held, by
a bare majority, that if Doe got well he would recover. "
In the equally Important case of Doe on ihe demise of
Buck v. Winchester, one of the most important rulings
in the history of litigation was made in the Court of King's
Bench, but what that ruling was I have now forgotten.
So strong within him was the spirit of litigation that
when, upon one occasion, he suffered almost fatal injur
ies in an affray, not satisfied with the damages he sus
tained, he immediately sued to recover more damages.
When this illustrious man instituted an action in eject
ment it was customarily entitled "Doe on the demise of
AorÃ"v. Fo and So. The word "demise" as here em
ployed moans lease.
I make this explanation for the benefit of undertakers,
reporters and law students, who have heretofore supposed!
from the Â»iso of this w<?d "dÂ«>miÂ«p." that Doe never sued
a defendant until some one had died.
Jn luxury, who had fallen * victim to
drink. She became such a hopeless
case that her husband turned her out
of doors without a penny. Her own
people could do nothing with her; she
was practically in the gutter, so they
brought her here. We kept her, ac
quired an influence over her, and
taught her to work. That's the great
thing, you see. She's now earning her
living and is greatly valued by her em
ployers. We teach them all to work,
and sometimes it's rather difficult."
Then, for the first time I learned the
real object of the home, which is not
a "refuge" in the usual acceptation of
the word. The ordinary "rescue" cases
brought in are only kept for the night
and then passed on to the army's Beu
lah Refuge. The "casuals" handed in
by the police are treated, according to
circumstance, as may seem most de
sirable. But the true work of the
shelter is preventive, not curativ?;
it aims at providing a home for the
working girl, both in and out of em
ployment, but more especially the lat
ter. Its object is to save her from the
discomfort, degradation and temptation
of the low lodging-house, to provide
her with cheap bod and board, to find
work for her, if necessary to train her
and to keep a hold on her affections
so that she need never feel friendless
and uncounseled, whatever her after
lot.
It is for these that the shelter has
been specially organized. Here they
are taken in at the cheapest lodging
house rates; here they are taught that
to the woman intended for a wife and
mother there is no degradation in
household ministration, that the art of
making a home comfortable is as hon
orable as the art of dressmaking and
millinery, that the good washerwoman
and ironer is as worthy as the account
ant or counter-server. Here they are
taught to cook, to scrub, to sew, to
wash, to iron, and, when qualified,, em
ployment is found for them in private
families or otherwhere.
"Hut what about the girls with no
money to meet your charges?" I asked
suddenly.
"Oh, most of them have no money;
we just let them run a bill."
"Indefinitely?"
"Of course. That is, until we find
suitable employment. We have two
scalesâ the five cent and the ten cent.
A girl chooses for herself and stays at
that rate. Once they are in work they
! pay us back gradually; many of them
I have months of arrears, but they al
i ways work them off and generally look
i upon this as home. Those who have
daily employment often like to stay on
j with us."
After seeing the rooms I was not sur
prised. Most of us have a pretty good
idea of what a ten-cent lodging is like.
Most of us would not be elated at the
â¢ct of sojourning therein. But
here it means sharing a cheerful, well
lighted ami \v<>ll ventilated cubicle with
one chum. Two neat iron beds, with
spring mattris.-fs and now; counter
panes, a dainty chest of drawers and
looking-glass, a wash stand, and, in
shun, the appointments of a cozy little
bedroom, this is what awaits the ten
BY JUDGE HUNT.
Citits have made rival claims to the birthplace of Ho
mer, but nations have vied with each other in claiming
to be the fatherland of our illustrious subject. Italy, the
land of music and of sor.T, through its great Neapolitan
writer, II Dago, asserts that Doe came of a musical fam
ily of notp, and that his progeny was Do of the musical
scale. The Feejee Islands have made a persistent but
ill supported claim, as the scene of his birthplace, but
Borne of the greatest biographical writers \>T the age have
exploded this claim by proving that no native of the Fee-
Jee Islands ever had a suit. Ireland has claimed him as
her own. A great Irish historian, whose name I cannot
pronounce, records that Doe's real patronymic was Do
li'ity, which subsequently degenerated into Doe when he
WU naturalized in New York; that among his ancestry
was the well-known "Against," who begat "Forninst,"
who btgat "Versus," who begat "Doe."
The muse of biography weeps to record the fact that
much of the honor erstwhile associated wltn the name of
I>".- has, in modern limes been dimmed, from its dishon
orable use by perpetrators of crime, and petty offenders
â¢gainst Justice; for, while in ye olden time this name ap
peared only in civil suits, it now finds its greatest public
ity in the criminal news of the day, wherein we read that
John Doe was found drunk on the streets, or that he had
burglarized a church, or garroted a citizen, or had beaten
his wife.
It is, indeed, a sad reflection upon the law that the
name of the great apostle of litigation should be thus des
ecrated with impunity; for while the law, in theory, af
fords a remedy for every wrong, in practice it often re
sults that its remedies, like those in medicine, fail to ope
rate.
At pome date about -which the mists of historical doubt
still linger, John Doe seems to have weaded Jane Doe.
This union was fruitful of suits, but it is not known that
it was productive of children. While John Doe was suc
cessful in raising issues of law, he never seems to have
developed an issue in fact. The domestic life of the Does,
both of the male or buck Doe, and of the remale or doe
Doe, seems to have been unruffled by litigation between
themselves; at least, no report records any divorce suit
Instituted by John against Jane, neither did the latter ever
sue him for separate maintenance, nor was John ever
compelled to saw wood in order to pay alimony.
The lawyers, in referring to this distinguished couple,
delight to call them "John Doe et ux." which means, not
that John fed on ux, or ate ux, or even liked ux; for ux
is the Latin for wife.
Posterity weeps to recall the many defeats which
John Doe suffered in his bouts with the law. He tested
every known method of getting out of court; the relentless
demurrer, the deadly non-suit, the fatal verdict and the
dismissed appeal. As the law writers of the olden time
expressed it. he was frequently "cast" in his suits, which
means that he was unsuccessful, and not as is popularly
supposed that he was melted down with his clothes on,
or run through a foundry furnace.
Of the personal appearance of John Doe, but little ftas
been written. The art galleries in the bar associations
of the country, which, at the present time, contain more
galleries than art, furnish us no counterfeit presentment
of his illustrious features.
As long as litigation shall continue to embitter the
hearts nnd lighten the purses of litigants; as long as it

as legislation deluges us with conflicting statutes and in
harmonious laws, as long as divided courts multiply con
flicting decisions, and as long as the names of Plaintiff
and Defendant shall be heard throughout the land, so long
shall the name of John Doe endure. Let us trust that
posterity, in contemplating his life, his character and his
services, shall say of him, in the words of another: "Cet

ODD CHARACTERS

BANK OF ENGLAND
PUBLIC institutions the world
over are all more or less in
fested with cranks, but none of
them can boast a more inter
estingcollection erf human oddi
ties than the Bank of England. I am
not referring to the casual eccentrics
whose visits are of daily occurrence,
but to certain characters who, because
of their long continued reappearances
at stated times of the year, have grown
to be regarded by the bank employes
as "institutions."
Most of these notable characters, in
the days of my service, were women,
and women of very uncertain age.
There was, for instance, the "Countess
of Windsor."
The "Countess" was a short, spare
little body, with a drawn, pale face,
an abundance of soft, gray curls and
an ever-present smile, which would
have been pleasant to see had its ex
istence been called forth by reason.
Her ladyship â nobody seemed to know
her real name â had been a quarterly
visitor to the bank as long as the old
est employe could remember, and was
invariably treated with the utmost
courtesy. Her other regular haunts
were the Foreign Office at Whitehall
and Somerset House, to the officials of
which establishments she was equally
well-known. Her history, Involving a
domestic tragedy and the sudden loss
of a large fortune, was told with so
many variations that it was impossible
to ascertain the true one, but that she
was of gentle birth was patent at once,
notwithstanding the curious and alto
gether out-of-date mode of costume
she affected, the main features of
which were an old silk sown of bril
liant green and a bonnet like a coal
scuttle.
The particular bee within that
alarming headgear was a belief that a
grateful House of Lords had, in con
sideration of certain services rendered
by her late husband, voted the little
lady a slight monetary award, a trifle
of some ten millions sterling. This
vote had been passed, in her poor old
head, long before the brown curls had
turned to silver, and, notwithstanding
the fact that she had never been able
to collect a penny, she never seemed to
lose heart. It was all a question of
time, she would assure you â time
and signatures.
My first interview with the "Count
ess," of whom I had often heard, took
place at the bank's branch temporarily
established in the Law Courts build
ing. She came tripping up to the
counter early one morning and, as I
advanced, greeted me with a courtly
bow.
"I am the Countess of Windsor. I
presume you are acquainted with my
affairs?" she said pleasantly.
'"As regards the vote?" I suggested.
"Exactly," replied her ladyship. "I
think you will find that the documents
are now perfectly in order."
So saying she withdrew from a shab
by reticule the most fantastic-looking
instrument possible to imagine. It
was a parchment roll setting forth the
Imaginary facts of her case in elegant
E^upt, signed (?) by an incongruous
crÂ»^. cl which, I remember, included the
Qdoon, Salisbury, Harcourt, Irving
and Bradlaush, and decorated with a
blue ribbon to which was attached an
enormous tin watch case, burlesquing
the great seal of State. I learned
afterward that some of the idle
youngsters of Somerset House had
manufactured this document, and it
seemed to me a sorry joke.
"Of course, I don't want all the
money down," explained the little
woman, as I examined the wonderful
sheet and wondered how I was going
to get out of the situation creditably.
'I am afraid, your ladyship, that you
have overlooked an important â "
"I know what you're going to say,"
interrupted the "Countess." "I ought to
have the Duke of Westminster's signa
ture. One of my Government friends
told me that, and I actually forgot all
about it. I'll attend to it at once."
With this she smilingly rerolled the
document and began to put it back in
its rusty bag, her trembling hands
showing in many places through a pair
of well worn gloves. As she turned to
go I managed to slip a coin on the
counter.
"Your ladyship dropped this, I
think," I ventured to suggest.
"Oh, dear, no," she replied, while eye
ing the money longingly. "No, sir, it
doesn't belong to me."
"Nor to me, nor to the bank," I said.
"Won't you take it â on account?"
Her face brightened instantly, and
she pocketed the coin, saying: "Then
you will please charge it up, sir," and
with another gracious smile went off
to see about the Dukes signature.
Another notable bank character was
an elderly man who, unlike the poor
little Countess, was thoroughly illit
erate and of humble origin, but who,
like her, had a vague idea of rights to
untold wealth. His name was Joe Wal
lace. Regularly four times a year Joe
would show up at the private drawing
office and present a check in rough
manuscript for some fabulous sum.
When informed that the check was
worthless except as a curio he would
feign the greatest astonishment.
"Is this 'ere intended as a joke?" he
would ask defiantly, and being assured
to the contrary would stalk out of the
buiiding muttering vague threats. On
the following day a letter would be re
ceived by the chief cashier from the
irate Joe. The bank museum contains
several of his effusions, all couched in
some such terms as these:
Bank of Englandâ Sirs: I rite to say
as my father as you no left wun mlllyon
pounds for me in youre kofflrs, but wen
I cum to draw a cheq to-day they clarks
woodent pay up. Please send me sum as
bisniss is pore and oblige, yours obedient,
JO WALLACE.
P. S.â This aint no ldel thret.
The solemn warning regularly con
veyed in his postcript for the past
twenty years had never even led to
Joe's exclusion from the bank, though
full inquiries were instituted in his
younger days, when it was found that
he was a respectable and hard working,
if crazy, cobbler, and perfectly harm
less.
Perhaps the star crank of the bank
certainly the best known in its various
departments â was Mother McCabe. The
form of this good lady's eccentricity
was religious, and she endeavored to
combine business with pleasure by
drawing her quarterly ample dividend
in life annuities and looking after the
spiritual welfare of the bank clerks.
She would bring with her, from her
country residence, two stalwart men
servants loaded down with New Testa
ments and a queer collection of hymns
of her own composition, wretchedly
printed and bound in covers of cheap
wall paper. The meter of these out
pourings of the saintly old lady was too
fearful and wonderful to admit of de
scription, but I remember that each
effusion terminated, as by way of a
trademark, with:
Amen â A. M.
Amelia McCabe.
I God's Appointed.
G. A. ADAM.

A commercial traveler, journeying
through France, visited Monte Carlo,
and, fascinated by pleasure and play,
lingered until he had lost at the tables
all his own money and some belong
ing to his employer. Greatly embar
rassed, yet reluctant to return until he
had retrieved his losses, he resolved to
risk the remainder of his master's
moneyâ Â£40 â on the coior most strong
ly suggested to him on the morrow.
Next morning while walking out he
found a red morocco diary; later on a
child gave him a red rose; he also
met several ladies robed in red. He
went to the tables, placed all he pos
sessed on the fateful color, and had
singular success, winning back all he
had lost and a very substantial sum in
addition, after which he wisely de
parted.
A Manchester merchant, by reason
of a "corner" in cotton, found himself
in serious financial straits, and des
perately needed Â£2000 to enable him
to turn around. He was not a man of
sporting proclivities, but for three
nights in succession he dreamed that
a certain horse had won the Derby.
Swayed by a sudden impulse he re
alized all his available cash, amount
ing to Â£700, went to the Derby and
laid the entire amount against heavy
odds on the hoTse of which he had
dreamed. The horse proved an easy
winner, and the elated merchant re
turned home richer by Â£Â£000. Singu
lar to say, neither before nor since
that occasion has he ever made a bet.
Some years since, before the Dunlop
type had attained its present popular
ity, a company was being established
in its interests, and a friend of the
writer was invited by an acquaintance
to take a hundred Â£1 shares in the
concern. He hesitated as to the wis
dom of so doing, but finally decided it
by tossing up a penny. If heads won
he would have the century of shares.
Heads won. He took the hundred
shares, and a few years later they
were worth Â£30 each, realizing a profit
of nearly Â£3000.
A city clerk who had saved some
money was eating his luncheon in a
restaurant one day when he overheard
two brokers at another table discuss
ing the affairs of a certain New
Zealand mine.
"Rubbish!" exclaimed one.
"You are right," responded his com
panion. "I have 1000 shares in that
concern I would sell to-day at a shil
ling each."
Impelled by an impulse he could
neither control nor explain, the clerk
followed the brokers to their office,
broached the matter of the New Zea
land shares, and, after some conver
sation on the subject, agreed to take
the 1000 shares for Â£50. Six months
later a boom in the said shares placed
them at Â£7 10s each, and by promptly
selling out the lucky clerk realized
over Â£7000.
"Wlsh't He Had a Mudder."-
They were children of the slums, and
their conversation was overheard by a
visitor from a charitable society, who
was taking them some substantials. It
was a half-grown lad who asked his
little sister what she was reading in a
scrap of paper.
"Suthin' about poppin' corn," art*
swered the child. :-?^
"Kin you read it out loud?"
"You bet I kin. It's about some folks
that was settin' roun' a nice hot
fire "
"Oh, my! Wisht it was us," inter-,
rupted the boy.
"An' their mother, she put some
corn in de popper an' shook it over de
hot coals, an' it popped out white, just
like dey was ; flowers. Den dey eat it
all up, an' dere mother told dem nice
stories."
"My, don't I wisht for some popcorn
to eat dis very minit," said the boy.
"Wese ain't got eny popper," wailed
a shivering infant of stunted growth.
"Nor no corn." ;
"Nor no fire."
Then a sick child lying on a bed of
dreary rags in the corner opened his
eyes and said peevishly:
; "I don't keer for #.c popper, nor de
corn, nor de â not V? muchâ but I
wisht I had a mudder^-oh, golly, I'

PLANS are under way to start a
farm in Finland where plants will
be grown by electricity. Prof. L.
H. Bailey of Cornell has been
asked to go there and conduct a series
of experiments in electrical plant grow
ing, in conjunction with Professor
Lemstrom of the University of Hel-
Bingfors. The experiments to be car
ried on have nothing to do with the
electric lipht or with the running of
the electric wires through the soil for
the purpose of forcing the growth of
plants by direct current stimulation.
They are to be based on some pertinent
observations made by Lemstrom, of
the effect of the aurora borealis on the
plant growth of the north.
It is a well-known fact that the
plants of the north arrive at maturity
in a much shorter period of time than
those plants which are grown further
south. It is necessary that these plants
should arrive at maturity very quickly.
Inasmuch as the summer season in the
north is very brief, and it has always
been looked upon as a wise provision
of providence that the plants were en
abled to accomplish their business in
life in so short a time. Professor Lem-
Btrom, however, casting aside the prov
idential idea, states that the rapid
growth of plants in the far north is
due directly to the light of the aurora
borealis. Light is one of the necessary
natural agents in promoting plant
growth and the efficacy of continuing
the daylight by substituting in its
place electric light for the purpose of
Increasing the number of "growing
hours" of plants has alreÃdy been
proven. In addition to the fact that
the light of the aurora might tend to
increase the number of growing hours
of the plants of the north, Lemstrom
contends that they are also stimulated
by the presence of the large amount of
atmospheric electricity, to which, as it
Is contended, the presence of the aurora
Is due.
Lemstrom, in furtherance of his
Ideas, has been carrying on a series of
experiments in which plants have been
subjected to atmospheric electricity.
But these experiments, while in a
measure thorough, have not been car
ried out on a sufficiently extended
scale to warrant any large assumption
being made in the matter. If the
plans of the two experimenters are
carried out in the manner which is now
contemplated, the result will be <in
electric farm of a decidedly picturesque
character. It Is proposed to erect a
line of posts around this farm or field
in which the experiments are to be
carried out. From post to post, through
the air above the ground, wires will be
stretched, and at convenient distances
along these wires small knobs or points
will project. A static current, such as
produced by the Holtz machine, will be
Bent over the wires, and will be allowed
to jump across the open space between
the wires from one point or knob to
another. A constant flow of electric-

best Investigations upon the electrifi
cation of the atmosphere in reference
to plant growing were those made in
Finland and in France by Lemstrom,
physicist in the University of Helsing
fors.
â "Lemstrom was first led to his In
sued invitations for their regular monthly
entertainment and dance at Odd Fellows'
Hall Friday â¢ venlne, January 14. An un

qulries by observations upon vegeta
tion and meteorological phenomena In
the high north, particularly in Finnish
Lapland and Spitzbergen, where ha
came to the conclusion that much <r ,
the rapidity of vegetation in the short'
summers is due to climatic electricity.
His first experiments were made in the
laboratory, and the results were so
promising that he at once turned his
attention to the field. He made an ex
periment on a small field of barley in
Finland. One portion of the field was
covered with small parallel wires, a
meter apart and secured to porcelain
Insulators, which were secured to small
posts on the margin of the field. At
intervals of a half meter each wire
was furnished with a small point, from
which the current could discharge into
the atmosphere. These wires were con
nected to the positive pole of a four
disc Holtz machine, which supplied tha
current. The current was supplied
from the middle of June to the Ist
of September, from 6 to 10 o'clock in
the morning and from 5 to- 9 in the
evening. The barley was well up when
the experiment began. The harvest
showed that the electric plot was over
35 per cent ahead of the remainder of
the field, and the yield and the quality
of the grain were improved.
"Having determined the good effects
of atmospheric electricity in high lati
tudes, Lemstrom now carried his ex
periments into France. Here he treat
ed cereals, garden vegetables and a
variety of fruits. The result waÂ«
equally good in the warm country. But
although these experiments of Lem
strom have shown that the application
of electricity to the atmosphere gen
erally influences plants profoundly,
and is usually beneficial, we are yet
uncertain as to how this effect la
brought abo-ut. It is highly probable,
however, as Lemstrom thinks, thafN
the modification is not the direct result,
of the electrification of the pJant Itself,
nor the atmosphere, but that they fol
low some chemical change in the at
mosphere which Is engendered by the
current. This Is one of the problems
â¢we will attack while working in uni
son. If it Is solved, we shall probably
know better how far to go* with this
artificial plant stimulating process. In
some cases it Is found that stimulation
Is advisable up to a certain point, but
from that point onward it becomes in
jurious. If we can reduce the system
to a practical basis, our forthcoming
experiments and those of the past will
not be or have been in vain."
"In about 280 years," said the scien
tist, "when the world's population ex
ceeds 5,994,000,000, the earth will be un
able to find nourishment for her peo
ple, and they will be forced either to
cannibalism or starvation."

It Is supposed that there are at least
17,000,000 comets in the solar system.The Newest Fashions From Paris
THERE was one costume at
Worth's which was almost the
most gorgeous material I have
ever seen. The front or "petti
â¢ ' was of heavy -white satin
ided in a wavy, uneven pattern of
green ivy leaves, and the train of the
gown was of green satin, just a shade
paler than the leaves which traversed
ii. As the front and back of the skirt,
so the decollete bodice corresponded,
only there was a pink bow on the left
Ehoulder, a cluster of pink roses with
their foliage on the right shoulder, and
a bit of creamy lace between the two.
The green of the train was attached to
the white of the petticoat by narrow
green ribbons run through rhinestone
buckles at intervals. Then there was
a. pink satin embroidered in a pattern
of silver iris, the neck and sleeves of
the bodice completely surrounded by
pink roses half veiled in lace.
One of the characteristics of a true
Parisian ball gown is that it shall
have no two sides alike. As many ma
â¢ terials as can be conveniently used,
and these arranged so that one sleeve
be plain, the other ornate, fits the
Paris fancy. Many of the newest even
ing gowns continue to have long trans
parent sleeves with the low-cut bod
ic-s. It is a pretty arrangement, which
enables the wearer to dispense with
gloves and be all the more ready for
applauding.
A lovely pink brocade I saw at
"Worth's was half covered as to skirt
with graduated flounces of pink chif
fon, rounding apronwlse up from the
front, and making the back of the
Bkirt dellciously full. The long sleeves
were of cream lace, covered by narrow
puffing of pink chiffon laid on in lat
tice-work pattern.
A white crepe stuff was made up
over white silk, and fairly framed with
ruffles edged with cream lace. Of
course there was the inevitable gray,
â  so ponular among the well-dressed of
-Paris. One lovely gray brocade was
elaborately embroidered with cut steel,
'â¢â  which is now an absolute rage for
trimming. It looks rather dowagerish,
though.
In a serviceable party dress I saw a
really blue silk under black tulle em
broidered with jet sequins and paillots,
but the most surprising gown of all
had a room entirely to itself and was
mounted on a pedestal in state. It had
. long sleeves, resembling the "angel"
sleeves our grandmothers used to wear,
and such a long, long train! It was of
bright blue velvet, opening over a pet
ticoat of white satin, and the sleeves,
corsage, petticoat and train alike were
. embroidered in the most marvelous
... and complete way with gold and ex
quisite imitation jewels, diamonds,
seed pearls and emeralds. It must
have cost a fortune, for the work was
as fine and regular and perfect as any
Jewelry in its sotting. Yet it was a
gown which only showed its immense
beauty upon close inspection. For a
casual glance a good passementerie
would have served almost as well. It
was for an English lady's court dresÃ,
they told me! Well, it is just as gor
geous as any of the fancy costumes
at the Duchess of Devonshire's ball.
' Yet to my poor and simple mind, it
seemed, like Lady Clara Vere de Vere,
"not one to be desired.".
The wearer of all that magnificence
would feel something as did the
woman who tried to wear a million
dollars' worth of jewelry and found
herself weighted almost to extinction.
I saw a few handsome street dresses
at Worth's, but they were mainly
grays and greens. A gray broadcloth,
"strapped" with narrow bands of
the cloth, and these carefully stitched,
was among the best, and a green pe
lisse velvet looked very lovely if heavy,
and was edged nicely about with sable.
The Russian "blouse" was out in
strong evidence. In Paris the finest
bodices are bloused but very slightly,
while the jackets are given full swing.
In England the blouse just blouses all
over, especially at the sides. However,
it is in England that one sees the per
fection of the tailor-made and street
gowns. In Paris the dressmaker will
put chiffon on a heavy cloth that you
distinctly explain you want solely for
street wear. It is in the light and airy
that the Parisians excel. At the Maison
"Worth I don't think I beheld a single,
solitary plain skirt. There was always
a something or other either just below
the waist line or at the hem. Often
there were trimmings covering nearly
all of the skirt, and I naturally asked
lÂ£ Jean if overskirts were coming in
again. He shook his head and denied
the soft impeachment, saying the peo
ple would have none of them, and then
he had shown me the very latest thing
in skirts. It was made in two pieces,
the upper part fitting extremely tight
ly, the lower part in very much after
the manner of a Spanish flounce, only
that it had no "heading" and was
gored to flare instead of ruffled.
When the figure is very slender and
it la desirable to have some fullness
right at the back, the "apron" part is
restricted to the front of the skirt. In
either case this represents the very
newest wrinkles in Paris, and though
I cannot find it in my heart to alto
gether like it, yet the skirt has its re
deeming features of grace.
At Paquin's, still in the Rue de la
Paix, the difference from Worth's is
very marked. Here there is talk and
laughter, and dress-crowded rooms,
and much bustling to and fro. On the
whole, though, I don't think one see*
as much, and the only clear impression
that I carried away with me is that to
be fashionable one must wear gray
combined with pink or with violet, and
be sure to have some chinchilla fur for
trimming. Last year it was grebe; this
year it is chinchilla which rules Paris,
and very pretty it is, though perish
able. For a fur, and speaking after
the manner of furs, it may really be
said not to wear at all. Now, I don't
know the actual price of anything at
these establishments. I never ask, be
cause I do not care about a too, too
violent jar to my impecuniousness.
Besides, in Paris there are always two
or three prices possible; it all depends
whether Â»you are a stranger or native.
As you are foreign so you are bound to
pay tribute to French genius.
At the French theaters the pretty
custom obtains of wearing toques with
low-cut evening dress. As photograph
ers have found out this is an ar
rangement that is most becoming. I
like the French hats because they are
modest as to size and artistic as to
colors. In England Pinero remarked
despondently long ago that "all good
women wear big hats!" But in Paris
almost every one's hat is a size worthy
of honor because it is so self-re
specting. It does not flop and wave
about and get askew because it is big
and unwieldy and ill balanced. It sits
trimly and neatly on the head and is
always dainty. Just now ostrich feath
ers are unusually expensive, and ac
cordingly ostrich feathers are the fa
vorite trimming. A popular shape is
turned up on both sides, something like
a boat, and two feathers start right
from the very front, encircle their re
spective sides and droop gracefully to
gether from the back.
I saw Sarah Bernhardt wearing this
this style of a hat the other day, and
looking awfully well in it. Only it
seems to reuuire a tall pÂ«rson with deli

cate, slpnd-r features In order that it
shall look its best.
Another style of hat is turned up ab
ruptly at the back and tilted over the
I whaadi the crown being encircled by
two feathers, which meet in front, and
a third popular style has a very
jammed and crushed sort of crown, and
is turned completely up at one side.
The Paris hats of this winter are more
over, gay with flowers, especially vio
lets and chrysanthemums, and I saw
one a nodding mass of exceedingly wHI
simulated mistletoe. 1 couldn't help
wondering what demoiselle would be
daring enough to wear this tempting
! confection.
Something very taking and effective
in garniture is a combination of cot
ton crepe and gold and silk threads.
Its highly appropriate name la Quenan
na cloth. Its surface web of gilt and
colored threads on the cream back
ground shows out in good semi
oriental designs and suggests this as a
capital fabric fur theater waists and
tea gowns.
There is no secret In telling that it
sells for a trifle over half a dollar a
yard, and combines delightfully with
velvets of all shades of collars and gir-
The making of the new velvet
collar, however, calls for a change of
arrangement. The prettiest hook
around the throat to the left of the
chin are held very high by whale
bones inserted on the inside, and
where the conjunction is made a swal
!"\vtrul, three-cornered or arrow-head
shaped point of velvet must jut out
conspicuously.
Some very stylish costumes of ladies'
doth or French broadcloth, designed
fur slender young women, are mads of
two shades of the cloth, the fronts of
the waist arranged in straps, com
pletely covered with rows of braid or
line sflk cord appliques. The arrange
ment of decorated tabs and straps of
the dress material is greatly varied
this season and in constant use. Some
of them simulate a girdle, a Breton
corsage, with lines running horizontal
ly across the waist front, a bolero
jacket, a plaited waist, etc. Again, the
bands go round the figure from under
the arms, and over the arms from
front to back are laid flat, rather
broad epaulets, finished with the
straps. The skirt is of one shade, with
bands of the other covering the seams
to the knees. The small mutton-leg
sleeves are very closely fitted, and
show the strap trimming from waist
to elbow. Sage gray, brown, and dark
green cloth, or repped-wool costumes
are made with blouse vests of pale al
mond-colored cloth, overlaid with tiny
Straps of the cloth, edged with line
gold cord, with narrow panels of the
light cloth showing at each side of the
parted skirt. These panels are crossed
all the way down with straps of the
gold-corded cloth, set on in clusters,
about four inches of the plain cloth
showing between each two clusters.
Incredible as it may seem in this day
of silk, satin and beribboned under
wear, the most expensive underclothes
are made simply of lawn. It is linen
tawa <>! the finest, quality, to be sure,
made exquisitely by hand and decorat
ed with drawn work that one would
think could only have been done under
a magnifying glass. Of course real
lace is another feature of linen wear,
and any one who is the happy posses
sor of a few articles trimmed with real
lace can appreciate their value.
Parisian women who have elegant
taste as well as ample purses cry crut
in horror at the suggestion that Eng
lish women actually use woven wool
en underwear next to the skin. To the
Parisian silk alone is possible. Wool
is considered an abomination, fit only
for laboring men who have rough out
door -work to do. American women,
unbiased by foolish prejudice, suit the
material worn for warmth to their own
personal wants. Neither wool nor silk
nor even cotton is scorned, but the
most favored woven underwear is made
of interwoven silk and wool, and for
those who need heavier garments wool
and cotton.
The mixtures are more durable than
pure wool, beciu;p-> they do not shrink
In the wash, as all wool is almost cer
tain to do, despite the most stringent
precautions.
But aside from the question of
warmth, the linen lawn articles worn
over the woven wear this winter are
pimply fascinating. Gowns made of a
superb quality of linen are cut to trail
three to four Inches >>n the ground and
fasten down th<' <niirp front. Fichu
shaped collarsâ thos? fussy soul-fret
ting things so pretty la the looking
glass and so tormentiÃgly calculated
to fairly strangle the sleeping wearer
who may be the 1-ast restless â are
a:rain in fashion. The fichu is inane
ly decorated with good Valenciennes
laco, cut in puckered strips to outline
( lusters of tiny hand-made tucks. Ya
lenciennea ln<-> Insertion is laid on
with a lavish hand, and the ends of the
big linen bows that tie so becomingly
under the chin are also lace berufned.
Again the front of the nightgown shows
a series of tucks and insertions usual
ly laid in downward points. The sleeves
are broken frc-m arm hole to oJb:>\v with
encircling; bands of tuck.j and inser
;k.!S. At th â  i.l'nrw they are trimmed
with a wide lace frill.
Despite the Parisian call for flowers,
America has been rathf-r slow in re
sponding; They are coming to the front
now, however, as cockades in velvet
toques. The chief turn is toward vel
vet, those marvelous flowers that peo
ple never seem to tire of. This time
the whole toque is violet in color, with
a reddish purple tinge. Never were so
many wings, quills, tails and breasts
worn as there are to-day. Pheasant is
here to stay, and wholesale mUiinery
stores predict a revival next fall of this
catchy idea. This is a hint of which
it would be well to take advantage.
Many new designs in woolen mohair
and silk dress poods have made their
apl'.'urance. The majority consist of
undulating lines produced by jaciuard
wenving. V.'hlie those, however, at the
beginning only showed continuous Hups
they have now been developed into an
endless variety of designs, some cover
ing the grc-und entirely, while others
show more ground covered with small
spots in the color of the filling. The
bayadere fashion has evidently not
reached its full development yet, and is
one of the features which will be taken
up during the coming season.
Last season we had our best night
gowns accordi<-n kilted, but this was an
inconvenient pro ess. for it had to be
i . â¢â¢,>â¢ ;ited every time the nightgown was
cleaned or washed. Yet one more sim
ple method of making an attractive
nightgown is to cut it a little open at
the neck and to supply it with a large
sailor collar or tucks and lace, with
lace at the edge of the collar, to be al
lowed to wander down the front, which
should be liberally tucked. The back
of such a nightgown might well be set
into three box pleats, forming a yoke,
and slightly gored at the skirt.

BOY'S AND GIRLS' PAGE.
CRUISE OF THE CALIFORNIA.
[Synopsis of preceding chapters: Blnnle. one
of the six California boys on the Fteam yacht
California, has been captured by New Guinea
savages. He would have been put to death at
once had not two sava chiefs. Mah-Coh-Gaa
and Ghoor-Ghee-Tee, claimed him. These two
chiefs were ordered by an old witch doctor to
fight a duel to decide who should have Blnnle.
This duel takes place on the beach of a la
goon, and the crew of the California look on
by the light of the burning fleet of savage war
canoes, which the white men have lighted, but
dare not fire on the savages for fear that they
will hit Binnie.]
CHAPTER XI.
Merrily crackled the burning war
canoes. The flames lighted the faces
of an army of savages, who squatted
on the beach, forming a huge semi
circle, waiting for the duel between
Mah-Coh-Gaa and Ghoor-Ghee-Tee, the
great war chiefs, the result of which
would determine who should have the
right to take Binnie's life or to carry
him off as a slave. Blr.nie, bound hand
and foot, but placed in a sitting posi
tion, was in the middle of the semi
circle. There he would see the duel.
The lights of the California told him
how near his friends were, but he
knew that they were powerless to help
him. Above him towered the tall form
of a dusky warrior, who held a huge
stone battle-ax. This ax would go
crashing through Binnie's brain at
any attempt to rescue him.
For the first time the crew of the
California was helpless. The beach
was lined with savage sentinels and
landing was out of the question. Bin
nie's father looked on, pale and angry.
Harry Ostend shed tears of anger. The
crew burned to fire a withering broad
side among the savage hordes.
"Ha! What is thar?" demanded
Ostend suddenly.
His quick ear had detected the sound
of something dropping lightly over the
port side of the yacht. His quick
glance swept the vessel from stem to
stern.
"Where Is Keir.ona the Australian?"
he asked.
Then he saw the truth. The black
man had quietly departed for the
Bhore to risk his life to save Blnnle.
"Brave man:" said Binn'.e's father.
"He shall fare weil for this if he es
capes the savages."
Kemona was bright. He saw a huge
tree trunk drifting toward the shore
and he hid himself among the branch
es and drifted with It. Xo savage on
the shore suspected that the tree car
ried a man stronger, braver, more ac
tive, keener and more tireless than any
of them. The tree reached the beach
and Kemona remained motionless for
hours in the branches, waiting for a
chance to safely land.
And now a perfect babel of noises '
arose on the beach. The appearance
of the rival chiefs, each armed with
a frreat war club and stone ax, was
the signal for all the warriors to
scream and to rattle their spears upon
rough shields. Many of the savages
â¢were followers of Ghoor-Ghee-Tee, the
chief of the skull hunters, but more
were friendly to Mah-Coh-Gaa. They
separated into two parties, each deter
mined to see fair play. Then forward
came the bent and shriveled witch
doctors and rattled upon a drum cov
ered with serpent skin, and then the
duel began.
Mah-Coh-Gaa was the tallest of the
chiefs. As he swung his club it was
met by the swinging weapon of Ghoor-
Ghee-Tee. It was like the crashing j
of great forest trees when the hur- i
ricane whirls them madly together. !
The blow that would have cracked
Ghoor-Gee-Tee's skull was turned
deftly aside and Ghoor-Gee-Tee be- >
beasts they were also as quick, and the
rapid play and continued crashing to- j
gether of the weapons was something
wonderful. Binnie, in spite of his
perilous situation, could not help being !
Interested. The chiefs fought back >
and forth through the lnclosure on the j
beach, and often the wind of their war
clubs fanned the faces of the savages,
who shouted approval at the use of the -
clubs.
Suddenly Ghoor-Gee-Tee dropped his
HERE ARE SOME QUEER BIRDS AND ANIMALS CAPTURED BY THE BUMPKINS INTHE PARhT"
came the assailant. Strong as wild
club and nimbly ran toward the mid
dle of the semicircle. "Was he run
ning away? His followers knew bet
ter than that. Close behind him came
Mah-Coh-Gaa. But Ghoor-Ghee-Tee
was the quicker. He had his battle
ax and hud escaped before Mah-Coh-
Gaa's club con 1 reach him. Then he
turned like a tiger, with his ax held
aloft. Around it whirled with lightning
speed and when It fell Mah-Coh-Gaa
went down before it and lay stretched
on the sand, motionless.
And now the howling savages gave
Blnnie over to the skull-hunter to be
his. Above the boy's head the chief
raised his deadly ax. Binnle looked
up and gazed firmly at the chief. The
ax did not fall. The chief gave some
order and his followers hurried Binnie
away from the beach toward the for
est. The chief followed. Not an hour
later Bennie was being led a captive
in a long midnight march through the
wilderness on a journey which would
take him to the far-off fastness of the
skull-hunters. Ghoor-Ghee-Tee knew
that he would not be safe near the
white men. Behind Ghoor-Ghee-Tee's
band followed a dusky man whose
footfalls were swift and noiseless. It
was Kemona. the Australian. Never,
while he lived, would he lose sight of
Binnie.
All night long the crew of the Califor
nia heard the savages in the forest.
Anxious as they were about Binnie,
Harry Ostend decided not to land un
til daylight. At early dawn three boat
loads of seamen rowed rapidly to the
boach under cover of the deck guns of
the yacht. They pushed cautiously in
to the woods, only to find them desert
ed. The savages had fought all they
wanted to and had stolen silently
away. Where was Binnie? This was
the mystery which Harry Ostend must
solve.
Under a great plantain Mr. Ostend
found a poor frightened savage, whose
hands and feet were tightly bound.
When he was released he fell to the
ground.
"Carry the savage to the yacht."
commanded Mr. Ostend. "He Is too
weak to stand. Feed him well and
treat him kindly and perhaps we will
learn something from him that we wjsh
to know."
Throughout the forest there was
nothing to show Harry Ostend which
way the savages had gone. They had
broken no twigs and the rich moss un
der the trees bore no pj^n of passing
feet. All day Mr. Ostend studied In
vain.
John L,atour. on the yacht, talked
with the savage and learned much.
The savage was a chief in one of the
small villages that had been ruled over
by Mah-Coh-Gaa. He had been taken
prisoner by Ghoor-Gee-Tee, the
skull-hunter, with several other sav
ages. When Ghoor-Ghee-Tee made his
hurried escape with Binnie, he also
carried other captives savages. This,
so the savage on the yacht told Latour'
was bad faith and would lead to war
between the tribes.
"Will you guide us to the land of the
skull-hunters?"
"Yes," answered the savage; "for
vengeance."
"And where Is It?"
; "Along the banks of the Marwise
! River" and in the mountains I<irTVlse
; "To-morrow, then." said Harry Os
; tend, when he heard this from John
, Latour, "we will enter the MarvvAe
River and carry the war into the conn
try of the skull-hunters for Jn that
i piYnfiÂ° ne haVe WG " le chance to rescue

TWO BOYS WHO
HAD BIG HEARTS,
A TRUE STORY.
He was 12 years old, but he was vÂ»Â»-Â«r
small for that age. Perhaps VZsVZ
cause he waa tired all the while, and
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, SUNDAY,
his face was so pale and pinched that
one would doubt his age.
But his mother ought to know, and
she said Billie was 12.
Billie bought matches â "thirty-six
bunches for a quarter, wholesale," he
said â and sold them again. He wasn't
very successful at it, because he was
so tired most of the time, and he hadn't
the heart to protest when people told
him they did not want any, even where
they did not shut the door in his poor
little face.
But since his father died and his
mother had grown so frail from mourn
ing that she was almost unable to care
The Duel on the Beach With War Clubs Between the Two Great Chiefs for the Possession of Binnie,
f>->r the little baby sister, and could not
begin to do the few bits of washing
Billie had had to help.
Â« >ftentimes as he went toward home
with his feet aching and his little legs
quite stiff from the long walk from
house to house, he paused to watch
the boys in thalr rough and tumble
play and wondered why they likM to
run and romp. He felt a little bit im
patient when four or five chased glee
fully after the ball. One felt so com
fortable sitting still or even standing
on one foot. His unsatisfied child
ht ;irt was getting dwarfed. He started
out one morning with his eye* scarcely
wide open. Billie had only sold 10 cents'
worth the day before, and that only
helped them to a little broad and a
vry little meat. He had had a little
of the remainder of the loaf for break
fast, and he felt cold and pinched, and,
child though he was, his heart ached
i when he knew the mother would have
: nothing to eat until he came home.
And he felt so discouraged. People
1 did not want matches, and they did not
want boys around. But what was he
to do?
"Hello, Bill," some one said, coming
up behind him.
He turned around and stopped, boy
fashion, holding the sack of matches
! carefully over his shoulder.
"Ain't that a bully top?"
Billie looked at the little top longing
ly and nodded his head.
"Sell any matches yesterday?"
"< >nly 10 cents," Billie said. "It's no
good."
Billies companion was a sturdy little
chap of 14, well fed and well clothed.
He did not know what it was not to
have money in his pockets, nor to go
without mimeple and other things
whfii he wanted them. He was a will
ful little body, but he was good and
he stared straight at the poor little
chap.
"Say," he said, 'Tet me go help to
1 day?" And, as Billie hesitated, he
thrust the bright red top into his cold
little hand.
"I'll give you the top if you will. You
Just wait here and I'll be back."
And he was off like a shot and al
most before Billie had got through
admiring the beauties of the new top
| he was back, looking as ragged as Bil
lie himself.
"You see," he explained as he pulled
a sack out of his overalls pocket, "it
wouldn't do for me to go In those other
clothes. It wouldn't be a. go. I split
kindling wood In these, and I sneaked
f EDITED
BY
this bag from around ma's mincemeat,
and here's a doughnut." They divided
the matches evenly and started from
house to house. Billies friend sold ail
his matches and then began on his.
Once when ho pushed in an electric bell
his thumb got caught and he couldn't
get it out, and the bell rang so wildly
that the whole family rushed to the
door. And then they felt so sorry for
his tinker that they gave him 10 cents
and would not take the matches.
Three o'clock in the afternoon.
"We've sold every durn match," Billies
friend said triumphantly. Then he
took out the money and counted it
carefully and handed It over. "There
you are. Bill." he said. "Let's go
home."
"But you didn't keep none." said lit
tle Hillle, unable to appreciate the sit
uation fully. "Well, it was not mine,"
said the other. "They weren't my
matches, were they? You don't think
I'd take your money that came frori
your matches, do you?" Billies boy
h^art gave a great bound as he saw the
shining 10-of-nt pieces. But he was a
little doubtful. It didn't seem square,

fleeing cat. Billie hurried up to him.
"Won't I have supper to-night,
though," he exclaimed.
"I don't know whether I will or not."
the other said. "My mother don't know
where I went."
GOLDILOCKS AND
THE WILLOW TREE.
Goldilocks and I found an Ivory door
!n the side of Tamalpals Mountain and
we went through into the heart of the
fairyland under the mountain, and
there we met the Queen of the fairies,
near the Gentle "Willow Tree that grew
beside the Buttermilk River.
"The tree," said the Queen sadly, "is
my sister, who was turned into the
tree by the wicked Malenots. She can
be restored to her proper shape only
by a good little girl like yourself, who
has an opal."
"I have an opal," said Goldilocks
eagerly.
""Well," went on the Queen, "this is
the only day in the year whep my sis
ter can be saved; the day when the
Silken Hooded Lily blooms. Perhaps
you have come to save her."
"Is there a charm in an opal?"
"Yes, In fairyland. We can make
gold out of the pollen of the sunflower
and silver from the moonlighted bub
bles that float, like little treasure laden
ships, down lily margined rivers. But,
although the wisest fairies, the master
of the mines, who lives in the Blue Dia
mond Cave under the deep ocean, and
the Spirit of the Flowers, who paints
the hillsides in spring, have tried to
make an opal, they have failed."
"Is Malenote dangerous to children?"
"Not to good children," answered the
Queen, "but bad children have been
turned Into stones and trees and storks
and strange animals by her. She has
piled up the stones that once were
children into a house by magic, and in
that strange house listening: ever to
the moans of the stones, which keep
their voices, lives Malenote."
"And the animals?"
"They are things of strange shape,
that guard the house of Malenoto and
rush at all strangers with horrible
cries."
Goldilocks trembled. Every leaf on
the Gentle Willow Tree rustled and
trembled, and through the rustling
sounded a sigh, so soft and gentle,
that Goldilocks, dear little girl, was
filled with pity and courage to aid the
unhappy fairy.
Then the Fairy Queen laid a hand as
light as thistle down and as white as
moonlight on snow upon Goldilocks'
trembling arm.
"Dearest," she said, "do this and I
will unlock to you all the secrets of
the Sunrise Mountains."
"Suppose," asked Goldilocks, "that
Malenoto should turn me to stone?"
"She can do you no harm when you
have the opal ring; nor can she take
the ring from you If you do not touch
her. even when you are on the magic
squares she has made as snares."
"I will try to save your sister, dear
Queen," said Goldilocks, "not for any
reward, but for love of you and the
good fairiop."
"My messengers will go with you
and warn you of dangers. All the
good fairies will help you."
When Goldilocks gave her brave
promise every bird in Fairyland
seemed to sing. Then, too, all the
wonderful flowers on the Scarlet
Meadows opened their lovely eyes, and
the air was sweet with the choicest
perfumes. Behold, now, also, every
good fairy from the whole length and
breadth of Fairyland was there. They
came from the Palaces of the Veined
Lilies, from all nooks and hiding
places In the blissful country from
Crocus Land to the Vale of the Kind
ling Leaves.
There were thousands of fairies,
dressed In brave and shining raiment,
with rainbow-like wings â fairies of the
choir of Dulcet voices; the tenants of
the Royal Thistle; the creatures who
carry dreams under their shining pin
ions; the sea fairies who hold mirrors
for the mermaids, when they put on
their Nile green dresses and their
crowns of red kelp and singing sea
shells.
"Courage, child of day,"â so they all
sang at once to encourage Goldilocks.
Now we saw the house of Malenoto
From It came out a little lady, smiling
so pleasantly, looking so merry, that
Goldilocks went toward her. holding
out a friendly hand upon which was
the opal ring. Swiftly through the air,
flashing like a jewel, darted the Queen's
dragon-fly messenger, dressed in ar
mor of glistening scales.
"Beware, Goldilocks!"
These two words of warning were
enough. Goldilocks drew back in time.
But, in an instant, Malenoto sent out a
charm that turned the messenger
dragon-fly into a pebble.
"Child," said Malenoto, for such was
the lady, "what would you with me?"
"Please," said Goldilocks, bravely, "I
have come to ask that the Gentle Wil
low Tree may be changed back into a
fairy; andâ andâ (here Goldilocks al
most cried) and given back to her sis
ter, the Fairy Queen."
"Ha, ha," laughed Malenoto, "that
shall never be."
"Never and never?"
"No. Here, guards, surround and
chain this foolish child."
At this command forth rushed a
crowd of strange animals â tigers as
blue as the sky, horses with horns, dogs
that had voices like trumpets, and
many others. Around Goldilocks they
circled, one and all, with red tongues
hanging from their opened and bellow
ing mouths; with eyes that flashed
fire.
"Now," said Malenoto In a dreadful
voice â when Goldilocks had no way to
escape â "turn forever and forever,
foolish Goldilocks, into another willow
tree; forever to sigh when the wind
blows; forever to weep when falls the
dew or the rain."
As Malenoto said this, she drew near
Goldilocks, who, without knowing it,
was standing on one of the magic
squares. But suddenly Malenoto came
under the charm of the opal and stood
as still as a statue, while her face
turned pale.
"How is this, child?" she asked.
"Where did you get the opal?"
"I have nothing to say," answered
Goldilocks, seeing that Malenoto had
become powerless and frightened, "only
this, that the Gentle Willow Tree must
be a happy fairy once more."
"What else?"
"These animals must all be turned
back to their right shapes and sent out
of Fairyland."
"And myself?"
"You," said the Fairy Queen, now
coming forward, "must be a prisoner."
Even as she spoke the house crum
bled, the animals became children and
Malenoto began to turn into a weep
ing willow tree.
We hastened back then to the bank
of the Buttermilk River, where the
Gentle Willow Tree had stood. Around
the place was a circular bank of roses,
red and white and yellow. In the mid
dle of the ring was the Queen's sister,
a beautiful little fairy, and she was
waiting for Goldilocks.
She was radiant and smiling, al
though she had been long unhappy.
The Queen, with her own hands, picked
a wreath of the magic roses of the ring
and placed it on Goldilocks' shining
head.
How the birds sang! The Laurel
Bird led. The Madrigals followed; and
all the fairies were a chorus in honor
of Goldilocks. The magic wreath of
flowers was borne by Goldilocks out
through the ivory gate of Fairyland,
but the blossoms withered and disap
peared when once we had left Fairy
land behind. They could not last else
where.
MONKEY AND FIREWORKS.
Tommy's Uncle Ned brought him
home a monkey from South America.
It was full of mischief. Last May Day,
so Uncle Ned said, it was two years
old. I must tell you what happened
to the monkey, to Tommy and to his
firecrackers, which Tommy had left
over from last Fourth of July, and
which he expected to use In celebrating
the New Year. Tommy could safely
flre crackers any day in the year, for
he lives in the country.
There was a whole boxful of crack
ers, for Uncle Ned heard what was in
tended, and he bought in San Fran
cisco a lot of redheads and cannon
crackers, and I don't know how many
packs of little firecrackers. One day
Tommy took them out and showed
them all to Jimmy Eggers, his little
friend, who lives across the bridge-
Tommy lighted one and set it off and
the monkey, who saw the perform
ance, chattered and seemed much

Two nights later the monkey broke
loose from his chain and went to the
firecracker box and took out all the
firecrackersâ the redheads, cannon
crackers and every one, while Tommy
was asleep. He found a match in the

waked Tommy, who jumped out of
bed and went to the monkey. The
light was burning in the next room
so that Tommy could see everything
in the room.
Just as Tommy came near the

a firecracker in his mouth and
lighted it, just as he had seen
Tommy's papa light a cigar. Then,
what a scene there was! The firecrack

AND CERTAIN SIDESHOWS.
The fire in the Columbia has been j
ihe one excitement of the theatrical I
T^eek, 1 told you last Sunday that "At
ney Island" was a warm show.
"When it nli hap] .is on my way
i<> Miss White's folk-song recital at the
rnia. A cab, with a hose cart in
front of it, . . Ine behind it and a
man paler than his shirt bosom inside
came shooting down the Kearny
street car track. The hose cart balked
near the corner ol Post street, the en
gine tried ii> jump the track and .came
crash against the rear wheel of the cab.
There was a moment of suspense as the
cab stood up on one wheel and I heard
the voice of Mr. Friedlander â four-fifths
of him out in the night â offering the
drive.- an extra dollar to get him to the
Columbia ahead of the fire department.
1 saw by the papers next morning- that
Mr. Friedlander had wasted his dollar.
By '. he arrived on the scene
Mr. Gottlob had delivered his little
Bpeech about a member of the company
being ill and the money waiting in the
â¢ h6x I'll'" in be refunded, and the eight
'â¢â¢Ifiundred or less persons who were in
-'â¢"-.the theater when the fire broke out
â¢had been piloted safely to the sidewalk.
'â 'â '. It was the most valuable speech that
ever was made in the Columbia, and I
â¢congratulate Mr. Gottlob on his tact
and nerve. It goes to show, too, that
managers should always have a few of
these fire-escape remarks up their
sleeves in case of emergency.
Â» â¢ *
; ;.. for several seasons the California
.has been an elephant on the hands of
its lessees. I fear it is to be used only
In case of fire. With the exception of
the Henseh.4 recitals, nothing there
has paid in the last season or two. And
even in this instance. Messrs. Fried
lander, Gottlob and Marx made no pro
fit worth speaking of. They asked a
nominal sum for the rental of the
theater s. toner than run chances on a
percentag-e of the business. Theatrical
folk say the house is hoodooed. And
et any rate it is not a popular theater.
Location has something to do with
this; so has the chill fact that the
house is never properly heated. I have
. captured most of the colds of my life
in the California Theater. Now, while
. the Columbia is being mended, the new
managers will have an opportunity to
warm up the place. Nellie McHenry is
sure to draw audiences that will justify
heat in the heaters, and a hot time is
exj'-oted of Mr. Broadhursfs farce
"What Happened to Jones," which
Harry Corson Clarke has secured for
the West, and will soon introduce at
the CaHiornia with a brand new farce
company of his own.
â¢ â¢ â¢
I regret that Miss Villa Whitney
White's wonderful little talks and in
terpretations of German folk-song
Bhould have gone scandalously un
patronized. Miss White is an artist
and a student, and she offered a blend
of entertainment and education of
which few living women or men are
capable. Persons go abroad to learn
such things as were made lucid and
itiful at thf-se recitals. I wonder
where all .the good symphony folk were
concealed while Miss White was at
the California? Several thousand of
them were glaringly missing.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Music is not of much matter with
the most of the crowd that patronizes
the symphony matinees. I think they go
because th^y have a vague idea that
going is the nice thing. Observe the
spasms of applause whenever Sch-el
falls tv playing something sweet and
gaudy, and you will find their ears.
However, so long as fashion furnishes
the means for art, what care we about
: her artistic conscience. The present
season would never have been possi
ble without the patronage of many ele
erant persons who do not know Schu
mann from Sousa.

The programme for Thursday's con
cert includes Tschaikowski's pathetic
symphony â or, as it was dubbed by a
grim humorist, who found in its music
something analogous to the death of
the composer, the suicide symphony.
It is easily the most sensational of re
cent tone-paintings. It stirred London
to the soul. Here is a London annota
tor's account of it, for which I am
much indebted to William Greenbaum:
Tschaikowski's "Symphonic Pathetique"
was first performed under the direction of
Its composer at a concert of the Russian
Musical Society on October 16, 1893. The
Leipsic Signale tells us that "although
the composer was recalled many times
at the finish, he was not satisfied with
..the effect which his new work had pro
hd.nced, and he expressed a hope that It
â  might soon be performed again, to enable
lr 'being- understood. To this end he also
'gave if, after the performance, the title
"Symphonic Pathetique," little thinking
how soon his wish would be gratified, and
the new title become, indeed, strangely
appropriate. A few days afterward the
master was dead, and on October 28 his
funeral took place."
. The movements of the Pathetic Sym
. ; :: : phony are, emotionally, so significant that
â¢ one can scarcely resist the conviction that
â â  |Â£gchaikowski had a "programme" In his
: v rhln'l when writing them. In the absence
' V.f any avowal of the kind on his part,

./ ;.;?;;< Â»" of his ownâ it is better
â¢ r he should do so than reostra one built
â  Â'." ir^m the impressions of another.
..V.;;'- The work opens with a short Adagio,
the theme of which is based on the first
figure of the chief theme of the succeed
â .mg Allegro. When the latter has been
twice heard, the developing of it leads to
a passage in- which descending scales play

I was asked to the Orpheum the oth
er night especially to note the little
one-act piece played by Patrice, "Alf"
Hampton and J. F. Whitbeck, as the
Orpheum management is advising
whether to make a feature of "legiti
mate" people, having in mind Clara
Morris, Johnstone Bennett and other
players of note who have taken to ele
vating the variety. The piece in ques
tion is written by Mr. Hampton. It is
entitled "A New Year's Dream" and
described on the programme as a "play
let." Mr. Hampton Impersonates a
young man named Eddie in evening
clothes; Mr. Whitbeck is his valet, and
Patrice is the portrait of his great
great-greatgrandmamma. Eddie comes
home with the soggiest, stupidest and
most uncomical jag ever seen, on or
off the stage. He talks and talks and
talks, invites the ancestral portrait to
"have a ball," and finally falls asleep
in a chair. The picture commences to
live as the clock rings in the new year.
Patrice is young and pretty as ever,
with the same accordion smile, and she
poses with facility.
But with those kind words praise
for the act must cease. There is neither
sense nor taste nor humor in the rest
of it. The "playlet" is an unpleasant
reminder of Rosina Yokes, and Mr.
Hampton is, as ever, an unoheerful
caricature of Nat Goodwin. In a reck
j'less moment I once said that the only

Willie Collier, supported by what is

a brand new farce adapted from the
French by H. A. Dv Souchet, and
entitled 'The Man From Mexico." Mr.

the late Charlie Reed in "Hoss and

ran for over fifty nights at Hoyt's
Theater last spring.
The argument of the piece is that

the play: An ignorant farmer by the
name of Rodgers, who, together with
his erratic wife and a marriageable
daughter, lives on a piece of land in
North Carolina, is one day surprised
by the appearance of a mining specu
lator who, under the impression that
a valuable mineral deposit is in the
soil, makes an offer to purchase it. The
offer is accepted and a deposit paid
down, pending an investigation as to
the land's mineral value. Rorfgers and
his family betake themselves to Paris,
where they are followed by Dave, a
poor and honest young farmer, who
has wooed and been refused the hand
of Esmeralda for reason that he is
neither rich nor noble enough to
please Esmeralda's mamma. It comes
to the knowledge of Dave that the rich
mineral deposit lies not in the land of
the Rodgers family but in his own
and that of a neighboring strip, which
has recently come to him through the
death of a relative. Hearing this news

Mies to other parts with another girl,
whereupon Mrs. Rodgers repents, Miss

The production at Morosco's next
week will be Oliver Byron's comedy
melodrama, "The Plunger." The
piece was produced once before at the
Grand, but will be presented this time
in a more elaborate manner, and v.ith
a stronger cast.
The story of the play has to do with
the fortunes and misfortunes of Walter
Glyndon, a young bank clerk, falsely
accused by the cashier of Rexford's
Bank, of forgeries really committed by
the latter. Glyndon becomes a fugi
tive, but is finally acknowledged inno
cent through the efforts of Dexter
Digit, "The Plunger," a fellow clerk
of Glyndon's and a well-known sport
about town.
The scenes of the bank robbery,
where Rexford is murdered, and the
railroad scene, where the heroine is
tied in the path of a thundering ex
press train, are principal of the excit
ing events that lend interest to this
type of drama.
TiVoli.
To-morrow night the second edition
of "Mother Goose" will be divulged at
the Tivoli. Th^ general scheme of the
holiday spectacle will not be changed,
but new songs, dances and specialties
will be provided for all the principals.
A unique hit promises to be "The
Dudes and Dames of Long Ago," a
gavotte sung and danced by the sex
tette of clever children.
Announced to follow "Mother Goose"
is the romantic Irish opera, . "Brian
Boru," which was one of the vogues
of the last New York season. It is
hardly as ambitious a work musically
as "Shamus O'Brien," but in the East
It was much more popular than that
opera. The book is said to be a good
one and the score reveals music that
is not only catchy, but high above the
ordinary in melodic and harmonic in
vention. Arthur Donaldson has been
specially engaged for the title role. Mr.
Leary toured with the original pro
duction and doubtless will be given his
old part in the Tivoli's cast. He was
the subject of many a praiseful para
graph in the Eastern newspapers last
season.
Orpheum.
The new acts at the Orpheum
will include Barney and Russell,
who appear in a comedy sketch In
which they introduce a number of
character changes. They are said to be
very clever. Paulo and Dika will ap
pear in French songs and dances
which have been a great success in
New York, where they played an en
gagement while en route from the
Folies Bergere, Paris. Mile. Dika is
described as a typical chanteuse. La
Petite Lund is said to be the most won
derful of child dancers on the stage.
She will appear in songs and dances.
Other acts on the bill include the Ell
nore Sisters, who will appear in a new
act; Farnum Brothers, acrobats; Kittle
Mitchell in a new programme of songs
and dances; Mile Rombello, the sand
paintress, and Musical Dale, in his
clever specialties. The ballet has been
retained for another week, but that will
positively be the last.
Chutes.
The Chutes' Theater offers its thus
far star attraction in the person of
"Chiquita," the "Cuban Atom," who be
gins a limited engagement to-day. She
is the greatest novelty, in a small way,
ever shown on Haight street, and
though 28 years of age, stands but 26
inches in height. She has created a
sensation in New York, Boston and
Chicago-, and, pretty and well-propor
tioned, bids fair to do the same thing
here. She sings, dances and wears
wonderful gowns.

ELMER E. BROWN, L J. CHIPMAN, H. MEADE BLANDE,
C. W. CHILDS, MARGARET SCHALLENBERGER.
THE QUESTIONS OF ETHICS.
1. What are the several laws that shouid control the pro
fessional relations of one teacher to another ?
2. What are the conditions under which it is legitimate for
a teacher to apply for a position ?
3. What shouid be the attitude of a teacher toward the
school which he has left ?
4. Do you think it would be feasible to set aside the
present system of application on the part of teachers, and
instead leave public school trustees to select teachers on such
information as they themselves may gather ?
IN order to ascertain the feeling In t
repaid to the conduct of teachers to
ward each other and their schools,
the following: list of questions was
sent out to a number of representative
educators thoughout the State:
1. What are the several laws that
should control the professional rela
tions of one teacher to another?
2. What are the conditions under
DAVID STARR JORDAN.
)
Teachers should not be se- <i
iected by trustees, but by educa- Â
tional experts or Superintendents *
of Schools. <
which it is legitimate for a teacher to '
apply for a position?
3. What should be the attitude of a j
teacher toward the school which he has
left?
4. Do you think it would be feasible
to set aside the present system of ap- j
plication on the part of teachers, and
instead leave public school trustees to
select teachers on such information as 1
they themselves may gather?
A number of interesting answers,
some showing a considernble diver
pprue of opinion, have been received !
and are quoted below:
State Superintendent Samuel T.
Black writes: "Just at present I have
not time to enter into a full discussion
of the questions you propound. Your
first question cannot be answered by a !
few words or sentences.
"As for the second, the conditions
under which It is legitimate for a
teacher to apply for a position are.:
"1. That there should be a vacancy.
"2. That the applicant should havo
the necessary ability and scholarship to i
fill the vacancy.
"Concerning the third question, I

The Orphans' Home at Gilroy is progressing

otherwise should always maintain a
friendly attitude toward the school
which he has left.
"Regarding the fourth, if I under
stand the present system of applica
tion for a position to teach, it is Just
what you suggest it ought to be; the
teacher applies to the school trustees;
and the school trustees, after canvass
ing the various applications, are sup

1. I believe that the applicaiion of
the foundation of all ethics, the G >'den
Rule, should control professional rela
tions of one teacher to another.
2. It is legitimate for a teacher to
apply for a position when he is proper
ly certified, and conscientiously be
lieves that he is able to efnci-'irly dis
charge tno functions of the pjsitioii.
'.'. That would depend entirely upon
the associations and environment Â«O
which <he teacher has been subjected
while occupying a position in the
school. If they had been pleasant, I
think that the attitude of the teacher
should be amicable toward all con
cerned; but if he had been subjected to
petty annoyances and persecution, it
seems to me merely human nature that
he should not feel kindly disposed to
; ward those who had inflicted injury
1 upon him. The fact that he has lost
his position should not necessarily em
hitter the teacher toward the school.
j He may like the schoolâ that is, the
children and his work, and yet lose his
position. His sentiment toward the
school should still bo pleasant, and if
: he be magnanimous, he might even rise
above the memory of the petty perse
cutions to which he might have been
, subjected by school authorities. It is
â  presumed, however, that if the man
! agement of the school by superior
i authority had proven positively injur
ious to educational work, the teacher
j would not wait until he had lost his
a fund for the purpose of securing a library
for the benefit of the member".

ed by the State Teachers' Association

2. A teacher who Is free from con
tract or other professional engagement
is at liberty to apply for a vacant
position, or for a position which,
according to definite information
given out by the incumbent or by
the authorities having power of ap
pointment and removal, is about to be*
come vacant.
3. A teacher should, it seems to me.
avoid any course of action which would
work injury to the true interests of
any school; and in general should, as
suitable opportunity presents itself,
seek to promote the true welfare of tbe
schools. I do not see that this obliga
tion is impaired by the fact that he has
lost his position in any given school.
4. I see no reason for discontinuing
the practice on the part of the teachers
of making application for appointment

The attitude of a teacher to
ward the school which he has left
should be that of a sincere friend.
to positions which they believe them
selves capable of filling.
But the practice should be subject
to wholesome limitations. A school
board should not be limited, and should
not limit itself, in the selection of
teachers, to those who have made ap
plication. It should take such meas
ures as may be necessary to get the
best!

L. J. Chipman. ex-President of the

2. It wcmld not be right for a
teacher to apply for a position already
filled, except he make application with
the proviso if there should be a change.
I do not consider it right for one
teacher to in any way undermine the
character or work of another; nor is
it professional for a teacher to make
application for a pnsitio-n on less sal
ary than is being paid.
3. The teacher should not do any
thing to interfere with the welfare of
the school which he has Ipft.

This is the course of action which con
duces both to the life of the individual
and to the welfare of society. It thus
brings the greatest amount of good, of

pursues it, and the least amount of
evil, of unhappiness, or pain to others.
This law, when carried out to the let
ter in the regulation of life, puts one
MISS SCHALLENBERGER.
Criticism should be made only
where its purpose is to do good.
in a position to accept as his guide the
world's highest ethical standard.
"But the teacher's real work differs
in some respects from that of other
men. He neither brings spices and cof
fee from tropic plantations, nor does
he plant and raise broad acres oJ
wheat and cotton, nor does he dig gold
from the treasures of Klondike; in
other words, what he does do is to
add indirectly to the wealth of the
country, since he belongs distinctly to
one of the classes of citizens whose
duty it is to sustain the intellectual
life of the nation, to keep the throb
of the nation's moral pulse up to the
standard which is demanded by Amer
icans, in order that the nation may be
assured an existence throughout the
centuries.
"The teacher is, therefore, doubly re
sponsible for acts not in accordance
with ethical laws, in that it is his dury
to keep his acts pure and above re
proach for his own sake and as an ex
ample to others.
"These premises fixed, it follows that
the teacher must beware of exercising
to an extreme degree the principle of
self-interest, for this, in times past,
has caused many a man to sacrifice to
a paltry ambition or for the sake of

A teacher who has lost his po
sition, either through his fault or
otherwise, should always maintain ;
a friendly attitude toward the
school which he has left.
the 'Dead Sea fruit of gold' the truest
and highest principles of living. There
fore, a teacher who resolves to pursue
his work unselfishly is bound not to
use â nor shouid he find It necessary to
do so â the methods of an intriguer to
maintain his position. It is a short
sighted self-interest which is the cause
of a long series of acts on the part of
a teacher, varying from slight dispar
aging remarks concerning a fellow
teacher's work to a scheming, without
conscience or consideration of right, to
place himself in a coveted position.
"Duty, then, demands that teachers
take no part in the struggles of petty
factions for their own advancement;
in other words, excellence of work, sta
bility of character and sturd'.ness of
example are the prerequisites for the
securing and retention of a position.
"The foregoing general remarks
bring us to the second question, in
dealing with which it must be remem
bered that the school law of California
makes the positions of all teachers in
the public schools vacant at the close
of the school year, namely, July 1; that

THE KNIGHTS OF HONOR.
Last Monday. AncUat Lgd^e held its meeting
tion. Of course it is obligatory on the
trustees to carefully investigate the
qualifications of all applicants, and se
lect the best among them. Under the
present system there is nothing to pre
vent trustees from obtaining good
teachers if they use sound business
sense."
â¢ * â¢ â¢
1. I was going to say. in answer to
this question, that conformity to the
Golden Rule was the only law neces
sary. But like all general laws, it is
capable of widely different interpreta
tions, i. c., Mr. A is a teacher of ordi-'
nary ability, who has held his position
for some time. Mr. B applies for it,
bringing indisputable evidence that he
is much better fitted for the place.
Now, if Mr. A is a fair-minded man
and has the welfare of his school at
heart, he ought to want to resign, and
if Mr. B is likewise fair-minded, he,
too ouerht to wish to be treated in the
same way if the time ever comes when
a still worthier applicant appears.
Such an attitude as this would tend
to call forth the best there is in a
teacher. He would strive to be the
very best man that the trustees could
get for the place. In a word, he would
try to dignify the position. But, if
doing to others as you would have
them do to you, means that you want
to hold on to a position Just because
you have been holding it, or because
you have an invalid mother to support,
or because you teach for less money
than anybody else, and that you don't
want anybody to attempt to 'oust' you,
since you yourself would not feel in
clined to 'oust' another under the same
conditions, then the Golden Rule will
not cover definitely what I think should
be the ethical laws controlling the pro
fessional relations of one teacher to
another. Here are some of them:
First â A teacher should stand on his
own merits. No teacher should build
himself up by tearing another down.
No teacher should try to hold on to a
C W. CHILDS.
The professional intercourse of
teachers is governed by the same
rules that prevail between men in
other lines of business.
position when another man is thought
to be better qualified for it.
Second â Criticism should be made
only where its purpose is to do good.
It should be honestly given and grate
fully received, even when adverse: but
should be made in a professional spirit,
at the proper time, and by one teacher
to another; not by one teacher about
another.
Third â There should be no organiza
tions among teachers with a view to
placing personal friends, graduates of
a certain school, etc. Positions should
be held without the aid of such clap
trap devices.
Fourth â A general fair-mindedness
and open-mindedness should be preva
lent among teachers, inviting discus
sion, promoting exchange of thought,
leading the way to a science of educa
tion.

of her homes, Pasadena stands un

.-.-.: ana selected this garden spot, attracted
My its admirable location and picturesque
:: ' surroundings, to locate, build homes and
. ; . raise fruit, little foreseeing that this val
"v .-ley which pleased their fancy would in a

â . Southern California. When first known
;â¢â â¢;â¢" as Rancho Ban Pasqual a dollar an acre

/'â â¢â  ant .price for lands Which now sell for

â¢ . ' then here, just the same; the mountains

'â  ." annual sponge-like storage of water; and

â â  '. : fort of all who have located in this val
'â '; ley are due the results of to-day, although
â 'â¢ certainly abundantly assisted by nature.
The fame of this orange grove settle
ment spread so rapidly that in two years
â  its lands were all taken â it had nothing
but two or three small lots left for sale.
. Then Hon. E. D. Wilson laid out his
Lake Vineyard subdivision of lands east
of Fair Oaks avenue, and the settlement
continued to grow and expand. These
early colonists did not aim to build a
city; they did not want a city; they wish
ed to live in a peaceful retiracy on their
fruit farms, and rear their children in
ways of intelligent industry, sobriety,
good morals and steady-going thrift. But
after they' had brought living beauty out
of barrenness, and made the desert to
blossom and teem with all goodly fruits
and all lovely flowers, the place became
so inviting that people crowded in to seek
a share in the Edenlike garden spot; and
bo it came to pass that the colonists had
a populous city in their midst, in spite of
their original desire and plans.
Growth and improvement have been
. the rule from that time to this, until
now Pasadena takes rank as the third
â  / city in size in Southern Californiaâ Los
Angeles and San Diego only exceeding
â¢ ..; it. Many acres of the original citrus
â groves remain, in the midst of which
beautiful residences have been built,
while additional acres have been divided
- ", into villa, tracts and smaller lots, on
-;. which flowers and tropical plants and
fruits are grown abundantly about the
Houses, giving the city the appearance of
â  ,'h. large park, studded with picturesque
'Â°. 'homes.
.In ISB4 the famous Raymond Hotel was
_â¢ - erected and the San Gabriel Valley Rail
,-Â° 'â  road built from Los Angeles to Pasa
. â¢ . dena, the same line being now a part of
â¢;â¢. â¢ the Santa 1 â¢â¢ main line across the con
/â¢â tinent. Up to this time stage accommo
, â  dation had sufficed.
This gave great impetus to the growth

:-.V â "â¢.In ] v ;>"-'ji Professor Lowe took up the
; j mountain railroad project which has
proven one of the electric wonders of the
' 'ago. On July 4. 1893, the first passenger
. '. trip was made up the great incline to
Echo Mountain, giving -visitors and
... tourists who now came Hocking from all
.. portions of the globe an opportunity to
see views of unparalleled magnificence
and mountain scenery unsurpassed on
this coast.
In 1594 the electric railroad -was built
connecting Pasadena with Los Angeles
with a fifteen minute service and extend
ing its line from the mountains to the
sea.
The rapidity with which the popula
tion of Pasadena has increased during
the past seventeen years may be best
thown by the school census, as follows:
ISSO 133 â  1889 1,776
1&&2 160 189] 1412

The 'census for 1807 shows 2970 children
'of school age (viz., between 5 and 17),
which indicates an entire population of
between 13,000 and 15,000.
Pasadena's expansion in wealth and
industry has kept alongside her increas
ing population. The total assessed valua
tion of the city was but $1,000,000 ten
years ago; it was $8,259.449 in March,
1597, and before another March half a
million dollars will have been added.
That her prosperity during the past
year has been marked can be shown in
,; no better way than recent statistics
'â¢ compiled from records kept by con
;â¢.". tractors and members of the Business
â¢ Exchange. This growth has been so
-â  gradual as to be almost unrecognized
even by those most nearly interested in
Pasadena's prosperity and welfare, but i
nevertheless there have been no less
than 267 new buildings erected in Pasa
dena in 1897 outside of all remodeled
houses, additions or extensions. This j
would mean, by a conservative estimate, ;
an addition of perhaps a thousand people

Improvements of the new year.
It has been stated upon reliable au
thority that 12,000,000 feet of lumber has
been consumed in building in Pasadena
sii:ce January 1, 1597.
And with these substantial Improve
ments the city has kept pace in its pub
lic ezpenditmres, there having been $200,
000 spent in street improvements alone.
The electdc-car system has been ex
tended and improved, with its lines run
ning into the. suburbs in all directions,
admirable service, and the most elegant
and commodious cars used upon this
Coast.
Improvements have also been made in
the gas, water and electric-light service,
and another year will show an equal ad

The attractions of Pasadena are manl

â  perhaps upon Its healthfulness and
beauty. The former is assured by the

mate in the world. Those who ha\v> had
the longest experience here admit this is
no idle boast. Tabulat. d weather re-e
ords bear out the claim; mortuary sta
tistics confirm it. It is a mild climate,
the lack of humidity in the atmosphere
in the summer, and the absence of se
vere frost in the winter, making each
D notable for being devoid of ex
tremes which render life uncomfortable
and result In illness. This is appreciated
when it is remembered that the ther
mometer rarely falls as low as It de
ll that the mean temperature Cor
ar.y given twelve months dues not Vary
much from 60 degrees; that the average
difference between summer and winter
v niperature is about IS degrees. The
average humidity in all observations of
the past two years when the thermome
ter has registered 00 degrees or above
baa been below 40 per cent, giving to
the not weather a pleasant dry-:.
Crest contrast to the Eastern muruinoss
When it is remembered that nights in
Southern California are uniformly cool
and refreshing, the comfort of the sum
mer season is fully demonstrated.
An important adjunct of health and
comfort in Pasadena la found in its sup
ply of pure mountain water. This is
brought from its alpine sources, through
rock-cut tunnels and steel pipes, to the
house of each resident, at a very mod
erate cost.
A sewer system which cost $175,000 and
i? in prospect of being extended to every
quarter of the city, has long been in suc
cessful operation, a 300-acre sewer farm,
seven miles south of Pasadena, and be
longing to the city, being a part of it.
Good water, pure air and good drainage
comport well with a cleanly condition
generally, and this is found to prevail in
Pasadena.
Naturally, in such a climate and with
the richest of soil?, there is produced an
abundance of fruits, cereal and vege
tables common to temperate and semi
tropic climatic belts. Pasadena is th-
center of a highly cultivated district
which never fails to yield plentifully of
everything which can delight the taste
and nourish the body of man. In its fruit
growing capabilities especially the valley
which constitutes the environs of Pasa
dena is exceptionally good. Its groves of
oranges, lemons, olives; Its orchards of
apricots, peaches, prunes; Its fields of
berries of many varieties; its broad acres
of vineyards; Its persimmons, guavas,
pomegranates, loquats; Its plantations of
walnuts and almonds; these are drawn
upon for the table in a never ceasing
from the beginning to the end of each
year, and they form no small part of that
sum of advantages which confers upon
the residents of Pasadena the distinction
of being a peculiarly favored people.
Nothing less than the pen of a poet can
do justice to the natural beauties of this
Ideal spot and the mountains towering
in the background with their favorite re
sortsâEcho Mountain House, Alpine
Tavern and Camp AVilsonâ afford trips to
the northward, while on the west the
picturesue arroyo invites to charming
drives along its wooded and circuitous
course; again to the east long sweeps of
undulating hills and oak dotted rolling
slopes, fields of waving grain, vineyards
and orchards, and here and there pic
turesque hamlets and villages adding
each its Individual charm, delight the eye
and furnish objects of many an excur
sion. To the southwardâ the seaâ luring
the visitor with its never ceasing delights
and in the heart and center of all, Pasa
dena, the gem of the valiey, with its
myriads of Bowers, green hedges, grace
ful trees and verdant lawns. Aside from
bealthfuiness and natural beauties. Pasa
dena, appeals strongly to that class of
people seeking the ideal dwelling place,
for here may be found unexceptional edu
cational advantages in its public and pri
vate schools. These former contain first
class accommodation for 2500 pupils in
their twelve grades, ranging from prim
ary to high school, and require the ser
vice of fifty-one teachers. The classical,
literary an.i scientific courses of study in
the hiph school qualify pupils to enter
the State University without examina-
"tion.
Throop Polytechnic Institute holds a
unique place among educational estab
lishments of the Pacific Coast in that a
large part of its energies ar<> devoted to
manual training. Its brick buildings,
costing $150,000, contain a full equipment
â¢ ops, studios, laboratories, machinery,
and it holds high rank among the
agencies which have contributed to Pasa
dena's fame as the educational center of
(Southern California. Students of both
i have equal aeeess to its advan
tages. The public schools include high
and grammar, Columbia. Franklin,
Washington, Garfleld, Lincoln, Grant.
In dose connection with our schools
stands I 1 asadena Free Public Li
brary, of which residents and visitors
ilike are proud. The building (of stone)
Is a beautiful specimen of architecture.
and it bouses about ISJDM carefully se
â ', volumes, which are available to
the public without other cost than a
Hpht yearly tax upon the property of
the city to pay its expenses.
Pasadena has also private schools high
in their standard and admirably con
ducted. _ _ . , .. .
To the homeseeker Pasadena s churches
are an additional lodestone. Nearly
every denomination is represented, and
the following table affords something of
an idea of their relative strength and
importance.
Advent. Episcopal, family membership 62
All Saints. Epsicopal JSO

The foregoing table undoubtedly falls
far short of the actual church member
ship, as it was hastily compiled from a
house to house canvass, necessarily made
at great disadvantage. It is estimated
that there are about 8000 church goers in
Pasadena.
Upon her social attractions Pasadena
peculiarly prides herself. Here are found
men and women of superior intellectual
culture and high ideals; a coterie of
wealthy, traveled people conversant with
all that is recognized as en rlgueur in the
fashionable world; a still larger number
of literary and scholarly men and
women; and among them all a charming
home life amid books and pictures and
music, influenced by the love of the best
things and the fear of God; many ac
tive in religious life, there being few
cities in which so large a proportion are
church goers.
Of social clubs for amusement and Im
provement there is almost no end. Most
noteworthy among these are the Coun
try Club, composed of wealthy society
men, and organized for the enjoyment of
outdoor sports and social amenities; the
Valley Hunt Club, one of the oldest so
cial organizations of the city, including
over 100 members of the fashionable 400,
and giving impetus to all society life in
Pasadena; the Twilight Club, with a
large membership of gentlemen of schol
arly tastes: the Pickwick Club, com-
I largely of young business men and
devoted to cards, billiards, pool and
other gentlemanly amusements; the
Shakespeare Club, purely literary in Its
nature, including a membership of 100
of the most advanced and Intellectual
women of the city; the Oratorio Society,
a large organization devoted to vocal
music; the Symphony Club, and scores
of others, all making for pleasure or in
tellectual advancement.
The Valley Hunt Club owns a magnifi
cent clubhouse and grounds, and the
Pickwick Club has handsomely fitted up
quarters.
Nearly all the established philanthropic
organizations and fraternal orders have
a representation here. The Masons are
represented by two Blue Lodges, a chap
ter of the Royal Arch degree, a Com
mandery of Knlphts Templar, and or
ganizations of Scottish Dodles, all having
a large membership and quartered in
one of the finest halls In the State. There
is also a flourishing chapter of the Order
of the Eastern Star. Among other or
ders represented by prosperous organi
zations are the Odd Fellows, Knights of
Pythias, Ancient Order of Foresters of
America, Ancient Order of United Work
men, Knights of the Maccabees, Inde
pendent Order of Foresters, Woodmen of
the World, Fraternal Aid Society, Chosen
Friends, Good Templars, the Royal Ar
canum, Grand Army of the Republic,
Woman's Relief Corps, and Sons of Vet
erans.
Company I of the National Guards of
California is a fine organization, of
which Pasadena is justly proud, and the
Americus Club, organized at the last
Presidential election, has received eulo
gies throughout the State wherever it
has been seen for its high character,
handsome appearance and admirable
drilling.
Pasadena also congratulates herself
upon her streets and avenues, which are
all broad, well-guttered, curbed and
cleanly kept, with seventy miles of
pavement, and for the most part beauti
fully shaded.
One of the most important city im
provements of the past year has been the
graveling of its roadways, which has
greatly added to the fine and finished ap
pearance of the town and to the com
fort of the public generally.
No city In the West has more elegant
equipages and private turnouts or finer
horse and driving is the chief pleasure
of visitors and residents. In considera
tion of this, great attention is paid to the
condition of the city's thoroughfares and
$5000 has been spent in the past three
months graveling wornout streets. At a
conservative estimate $200,000 has been
expended in street improvements during
1897.
Another recent important accomplish
ment has been the development of water
for irrigation at individual expense and
by the water companies. This has been
done by sinking wells, and some valua
ble underground water channels have
been found. This work has been rather
devoted to improving the water supply
of districts previously planted than to
the extension of orchard acreage, and
thus the condition of horticulture has
been placed on a more solid footing,
while the gratifying assurance has been
given that an ample supply of water
exists to meet any requirements of the
future.
Pasadena's municipal affairs are in the
hands of an able Board of Trustees,
whose president is virtually mayor of the
town. These gentlemen serve without
emolument and devote their best ener
gies and abilities to administering her
public affairs. Calvin Hartwell is presi
dent of the board, the Trustees being
Sherman Washburn, George Patten, H.
M. Hamilton, H. G. Reynolds. W. E.
Arthur acts as City Attorney; John G.
Rositor, City Recorder; J. H. Merriam.
Justice of the Peace. The police force,
under the efficient leadership of the
city marshal, W. S. Lacey, although
small in numbers, has thus far been
equal to the city's needs.
Pasadena has also a thoroughly effi
cient and well-equipped Fire Depart
ment, which is invariably prompt in
giving effectual service.
Chief among all things which Pasa
dena has reason to felicitate itself upon
is its Board of Trade, to whose constant
and untiring effort and keen business
sagacity Pasadena owes much of ncr
prosperity during the past five years.
This is made up of 100 members, an offl
cial board and seven directors. Herman
R. Hertel, president; Edwin Steams,
vice-president; Frank P. Boynton, secre
tary; P. M. Green, treasurer; directors â
James H. Adams, Walter A. Edwards,
Horace M. Dobbins, Warren J. Richard
son, Collin Stewart, Edwin Steams and
H. R. Hertei.
Pasadena is not a manufacturing city
nor are its business interests extensive;
it is essentially a city of homes. It is,
however, a fruit-growing 1 locality, with
extensive canning anil drying houses,
and has several establishments within
its limits which give employment to
many men, such as mills for making
woodwork, lumber yards and brick
manufactories. All retail branches of
business are represented, and the city's
financial business is transacted by four
banks, First National, San Gabriel Val
ley, Pasadena National and Union Sav
ings Bank, with an aggregate capital of
$350,000.
Pasadena has also ample railroad fa
cilities, having three steam railroads (the
Santa Fe, the Southern Pacific and the
Terminal) and the Pasadena and Los
Angeles Electric road, connecting the
city with Los Angeles and other points.
These competing lines afford the lowest
rates for freight and passengers.
What has been found to be one of the
greatest factors in Pasadena's growth
and prosperity and in influencing people
of refinement to make their homes with
in her gates is the fact that Pasadena
has not (and never has had) a saloon.
Neither has she a city jail worthy of
the name, the local bastile being merely
a lodging place for ihe vagrant or the
perpetrator of some minor misdemeanor;
nothing more imposing having up to this
time been needed.
The fame of the winter climate of
Pasadena has been heralded abroad for
several years, but it is yet to become
generally recognized that Pasadena's
summer climate is even more charming.
The initiated are coming to appreciate
this undeniable fact, as is being evi
denced annually by the greater number
of visitors who remain all the year, the
fewer residents who flit East as formerly
and the vast majority of her residents
who, aside from flying trips to mountain
or sea, remain comfortably the whole
twelve months in their cool and com
modious homes.
Pasadena's hotel and boarding-house
accommodations are extensive, and yet
they are being continually added to. The
principal hotel and more pretentious
boarding-houses are Hotel Green, Carl
ton, La Pintoresca, Mitchell, Casa
Grande, Spalding, Crown Villa, Pasadena
Villa, McKinley Villa, Arroyo Vista, La
Solana, St. Nicholas and Los Angeles
House.
During the winter season thousands of
visitors make Pasadena their headquar
ters, and many remain to call it their
home. Its close proximity to Los An
gelesânine milesâ gives it all the advan
tages of a suburban place of residence,
with the added conveniences of a great
metropolis.
Among other noteworthy buildings is
the Pasadena Opera-house, which is
equal to any In Southern California in
point of beauty, stage and seating ac-
commodations and scenery, not except
ing Los Angeles, and to the attractions
of her environments may well be added
the magnificent Raymond Park, once the
site of that famous hostelry of world
wide fame, "The Raymond Hotel," which
burned April 14, 1595, this causing one of
the heaviest losses Pasadena has ever
sustained. This park, covering thirty
acres of ground, is a marvel of landscape
gardening, and contains besides all the
choicer varieties of flowers grown here,
many rare and exceptionally beautiful
shrubs and tropical plants and trees,
gathered with great discrimination and
arranged with unusual artistic taste.
The park is laid out with wide, cleanly
swept and flower-bordered drives, and
from its eminence the view is extended
over Pasadena, the foothills and moun
tains, over the arroyo, canyons and un
dulating hills, and even a glimpse of Los
Angeles may be caught in the distance.
One of the great institutions of the
city which is deserving of more extended
mention that space admits here is the
local Young Men's Christian Association,
which was established in 1886, and whose
moral influence is distinctly felt. This
organization, headed by faithful, con
scientious men, deserves highest encom
iums for the good work it is doing in up
building the town and elevating thÂ«
character of its young men.
| As Pasadena's past has been almost
phenomenal, so will her future be, and
a year hence her progress will be still
more marked than In the year just
passed. From a city of the sixth class
she will ere then merge into a city of
the fourth class, with North Pasadena
undoubtedly incorporated in her bounda
ries. She will through extended rail
road- connections, and by reason of the
San Pedro harbor Improvement, reap
her quota of the general prosperity, and
with increased local capital will add to
her industries. She will continue to at-
I tract the wealthy from every city in the
Union, and new homes will be built, and
new adorers â won by her ever-increasing
charmsâ will worship at the fair skriM
of Pasadena.

THE FASTEST STEAM YACHT AFLOAT.
THE Elleide, owned by E. Burgess Warren of Philadelphia, is tbc fastest steam yacht in the She is a small
craft, with a length of only eighty feet, and her lieam is only one to ton. one of the sharpest-hulled boats afloat. Sev
eral times the Elleide has gone over portions "f ;i carefully measured course at the rate of a mile in one minute
and thirty-five seconds, which' is equivalent to nearly thirty-ttvf miles an hour. This speed has never been ap
proached to an extent worthy of mention by any steam yacht of any size In America <>r Europe, nor has it been
equaled by the swiftest torpedo-boats, although some of these are much larger and consist almost entirely of motive power,
whereas the Elleide is a pleasure craft and has ample cabin a<-<-<>mmod::tions for the owner and his guests. Indeed, the
only craft that ever made greater speed than the Klleide is the new English yacht Turbinia, which uses an adaptation
of the turbine wheel instead of a screw propeller, and therefore is not a fair standard of comparison.
The hull of the EHeide is flat-bottomed at the stern, and the immersed section gradually deepens toward the bow.
where the draft is only 2 feet and 6 inches, so she is one of the "skimming-dish" class; as she was built for use on a
lake this lightness of draft lii not to her disadvantage. She has quadruple expansion engines of 800 horse-power, the
toiler oeing ol the water-tube type and the cylinders of 24, 18, 13 and 9 inches stroke

THE BIGGEST KITE IN THE WORLD.
THE above illustration is taken from a photograph of the largest kite ever raised in this country. The gigantic
structure when standing erect is as high as a two-story house. The kite was built at South Bethlehem, Pa., by
William H. Markle. and it flies as gract-fully as the average schoolboy's paper toy.
It is 25 feet high and 23 feet wide, and is of the ordinary triangle pattern. The sticks are made of white pine,
5^ by two inches, and are tapered from the cross to 14 inches at the ends. At each corner of the cross there are two-inch
screw eye* vn these screw eyes are tied the four corners of the canvas sail, which is made of sail drilling. The sail is
sewrd on the i<ias. and along the edge of the canvas is sewed a rope three-eighths of an inch thick, with loops at the
corners. ThflM loops are tied with separate rope in the screw eyes on the frame, the frame being bolted at the cross with
an eye bolt, making it easy to take the kite to pieces, a very necessary thing, by the way. with a kite as big as a house.
The center hands are made of rope three-eighths of an inch thick, with heavy harness straps, which are also hooked
In the eye holts, in the cross and screw eyes in the corners.
In a strong breeze the pull of the kite has been estimated at from 400 to 600 pounds. During one of his experiments
Mr. Markle, who weighs 165 pounds, held firmly to the crossbeams and was carried nearly 100 feet into the air, the huge
kite lloating smoothly through the air, as if no extra weight was attached to it.

EASTERN MARKETS.
XF.V,- YORK STOCK ICARKCT
SHEW TOP.X. .Tan. â There was profit taking
on quite a large prale In the stork market to
day after an additional advance In prices in
the early trading. That there should be taking
of profits after the rise of the last two days
â was to hi expected and the professional dealers
who bought stocks late on Wednesday and
Thursday sold their holdings of the most active
and strongest Issues. The realizing was quite
pronounced In Its effect on New York Central
and Sugar, which reacted more than a point
from the high level of the morning. There
â was evidence of continued realizing also in the
1 local traction companies. These stocks have
advanced steadily all through the dullness and
depression of the last few weeks, apparently
on pool operations and the general strength of
th 4 market Is being- availed of to take profits
in these. Rome of the anthracite group also
continued under depression in the day. Not
withstanding these reactionary tendencies the
general tone of the speculation continued strong
and confident. Business ,was on a large scale
and embraced a large number of different is-
Fues. some of the usually inactive stocks being
brought Into prominence by (sharp advances.
J Realizing at the close reduced prices consid
erably from the best and. in some cases wiped
out an earlier gain. This caused an easy clos
ing, with net changes- mixed between gains
and losses.
I The expected has happened !n the stock mar
ket tills week Jn an outbreak of something very
like a ,furor of speculation and an upward
rush of prices of pretty much all grades of se
curities. There was a halt In the anticipated
awakening on Monday and Tuesday/and some
lines due to several causes, but primarily
to disappointment at the continued stiffness
.â¢-- of the money market pending the final pay
â¢â¢= ment â¢ of _ the- Union Pacific settlement. This
, Involved the withdrawal from the market of
18, 513,400, anu Its payment- into the Treasury,
and. together with accumulation of funds In
cident to regular January disbursements, re
sulted in raising the rate of money to 6 per
â â¢â¢ cent on Monday. By Wednesday afternoon the
'â¢ â¢ funds thus disbursed began to come back Into
â .." the market for â  investment and the Govern
â¢â¢â¢ ment 'â¢> out of Interest and redemption had
â¢ offset the Union Pacific payments. The de
â¢ cunes In prices of stocks earlier in the week
â¢ â¢ were quickly retrieved and professional opera
.-_â¢â¢ tors .and commission house broker* acting for
' â¢ outbid* speculators and investors began to vie
... ii" each other 1n marking up prices.

were left in New York bank* at the time of
part of the Union Pacific payments. These de
posits amount to something over |U,C00,0Â«.
I Part of them are secured bar Covernment
bonds, whose redemption is already provided
, for. so that their surrender would involve
stmply a bookkeeping exchange.
; But the taking op by th- <: .vernment of
. the total amount would probably involve the
withdrawal of a sufficient puiii in the money
market to serve quite effectively to steady
rates of Interest. The high rate for monry
was re-enforced as a factor of stock market
depression by the forebodings expressed by two
prominent railroad presidents on Monday that
there would be no profit in competitive rail
road business, aB there had been none, unless
Congress would authorize pooling. Recent bull
leaders of speculation made rather ostenta
tious display oÂ£ discouragement over these ut
terances. I^ater developments suggest that thÂ°
official trepidation may have been rTprrsarrt
with a view to effecting projected legislation,
and that the bull speculators may have so far
overridden the then existing fears as to lay
In an ample line of storks, looking to the
later disposition of the clouds upon their minds
with the rise in prices.
Rallmad earnings reported for the we<Â»k
were an effective cure for much of the gloomy
; apprehension of railroad officials. In the for
eign exchange market the feature of the week
has been a demand which has been speculative
; and based on the prevailing low rute of ex
1 change and the belief that the need f.T ex
; change will grow within the nÂ«"xt few weeks.
The average level of stock prices has risen
I between 1 ami 2 points during the week.

THE FINANCIAL SITUATION.
NEW YORK, Jan. S.â The Financier says:
The conditions outlined in the analysis of the
New York bank statement lor December 31,
I Indicating an easier money market, are re
i fleeted In a still more noteworthy degree in the
i exhibit of the clearine-house institutions for
] the week ending January S. The banks have
I gained heavily in cash and deposits and the
! surplus reserve is Jfi.475.525 larger than seven
â  days ago. The statement Includes the dividend
period covering the first of the year. What this
i means is shown in the fact that the clearings
i for the week in New York exceed $1,000,000,000.
. Th*> expansion of J10.J25.3C0 in deposits ail the
Fa n of $3,107,900 represent the payment of inter
: est which have been made, Part of the m
croase, however, can be attributed to the in
terior movement, which is bringing $2,000 000
Into New York every week. This money was
. first attracted by the temporary high rates pre
vailing, but its return from this time will be a
purely normal operation.
The reserves of the New York brinks for
years past have been swelled from January well
into the spring Reason by interior remittances,
the expansion being regulated by current busi
ness conditions. There is no reason for be
lieving that the movement will be less than in
former years, and the only inference is that
; money will be easier. As the trade balance In
: favor of the. United States seems to be grow
1 ing, it would not be strange if the investment
of sterling exchange, now approximating $20.
000.000, were increased. This, however, is depend
ent solely on the course of money rates
abroad. The Bank of England reserve is lower
I than for years, but as a hearty increase is
! usually made after the beginning of thÂ» year.
j it looks as if money in Furnpe Is following the
I same course as in the United States. In that
| case the surplus funds of this country will
have to seek domestic- channels for employ
ment. It need not be repeated that it win
necessitate a most favorable business outlook
to abso-h th" full total of the money now avail
able. Th? fact that the treasury Is getting on
a self-sustaining basis may relieve the situa
, tion somewhat by Â«topr>'nÃ- the steirlv stream
that has been pourinsr Into the market because
of continued deficiencies. Another fact Is the
gradual withdrawal of Government deposits
now In New York banks. The dermnd for loan?
Is increasing also and will operate to steady
rates.

CHICAGO GRAIN MAKItET.
CHICAGO, Jan. The action of Wheat dur
'â â  ing mopt of the early morning was in UnÂ« with '
] the early news. The rain and cold wave pre
; dieted by the Weather liureau failed to ma- !
terialize, which rather weakened those wi.o
yesterday had become Inoculated with the virus ,
1 of fear fcr next season's crop. Liverpool showed
i *Â»d advance, Which was hardly up to expecta
; tions, 'and early Argentine news watt quite 'â 
i bearish. The result ot these several pieces of
Information was toe creation ut v somewhat ;
â  bearish feeling at ' the opening. May Wheat !
opened 91% cto fl'-A'. against '.'i-nC at the close 1
1 yesterday, and in about half an hour it hud
' got down to VlH@9lVic. The Duluth market
came again to the support of the bulls by ad- |
! vancing cash Wheat there from 91c to"'S2Vie
in a few minutes. It was thought here that the |
advance could have been and probably was
manipulated from Chicago. It had a bullish '
I effect, notwithstanding. Paris and Antwerp .
I each quoted a moderate advance for Â« the day â 
: and that was an additional bullish factor. |
I Baltimore reported a large quantity of Wheat i
sold for export after close of Change yester- '
1 day anil foreign bids to-day at lc over yester
j day's bid prices. The latter Information, to
gether with the higher quotations from the
! continent and heavy Atlantic exports caused a
rally to 91TsC, but it quickly slid off again to
91Vic . lid was at that point ten minutes from
the close. In that ten minutes, however, the
market turned strong again and at the- close
May was offered at Sl?Â»c.
Business In the* Corn pit was dull and prices !
moved within a small range. The close showed
.1 decline of Vt.c.
Oats were dull and without feature. May
â  closed unchanged from yesterday.
Provisions were strong from start to finish.

Harrison's circular says: "The very 'light
deliveries in December have served to diminish
the already depleted stocks here in yard of
Colonial grades. Besides, all that can arrive
here before March next only foots up 23.U00
tons, at which time Australian will virtually be
out of, the market. In fact, the entire mar
ket for several months past has been controlled
by the coast collieries. The total engagements
to date of coal carriers from Sydney and New
castle, en route and to be loaded, figure up
70.000 tons capacity. The total Colonial ship
ments of coal to San . Francisco for 1597 were
658,372 tons. 6.".20 tons In excess of MM, Present
high freight rates and the Increased duty will
materially diminish shipments from the Col
onies this year, unless we â¢ball have seasona
ble rains later on, which will induce tonnage to
seek this port. It is difficult to guess how coal
will act during the currency of this year.
Labor troubles are feared locally, coal trans
portation will be uncertain, and fully twelve
addltonal steamers are promised us for the
Alaskan trade; these combined with our own
fleet will be large fuel consumers."

COFFEEâ The circular ol C. E. Bickford gives
the receipts at this port in ISS7 at 143,241 bags,
against 130,209 In 1596, and the sales from first
hands at 122,421 bags, against 112.153. The
stock in first hands January 1 was 10.0G6 bags,
against 3188. The world's visible supply Jan
uary 1 was 6,357,363 bags, against 4.025.187 bags
January 1. ls:>7. The circular says:
"Our last review was dated December 17,
frcm which time to the close of the year very
little was done. The present week has shown
more activity, quite a fair amount of business
being done in all classes at steady prices. New
crop Guatemalas are In demand for home use
and export both domestic and foreignâ strictly
superior styles especiallyâ the arrivals of which
have been small and insufficient so . far to
meet orders.
"The New York market remains about the
same, with an easier feeling noticeable during
the past three days.
"To-day's stock consists of 7.".S Costa Rica,

Showing That it Is
Wide Awake.
The Growing Boom on the
Mother Lode and on
the Desert.
THE Mining Fair will be the great- i
est. most varied and most inter- I
esting mining exposition ever held, !
and it will be made by its many
spectacular, romantic and novel j
features and events as attractive j
to the general public as to mining ]
men. This is assured beyond question, and
practically all the space will be crowded
by exhibits already arranged for. Co
operation on the part of business men and [
on the part of mining men and j
manufacturers interested In mining and \
mining companies throughout the
State is so general that there will be a
wealth of exhibits of every conceivable
nature.
The chief thing that will be lacking in
the fair will be large and effective ex
hibits from some of the mining counties.
There is not a mining county In the State i
which can afford to lose this unexampled
opportunity for drawing attention to its
mining resources. A few will have superb
exhibits that will create in the minds of
thousands the impre.sslon that those are
the counties for a gold-seeker to go to,
but many counties will be poorly repre
sented, if at all, by any organized and
comprehensive showing of mineral re
sources and possibilities. Their absence
will not be to the detriment of the talr
as a whole, but to the counties who miss
taking a tide at its flood.
Nevada and Calaveras counties seem to
provide the best and most enterprising
efforts. The Nevada County Supervisors
have appropriated the magnifiefnt sum of
$â 2000, and private enterprise is doing won
ders to supplement this and make its use
effective. What Nevada County Is doing
is a shining example for others. The fol
lowing interesting account of what the
exhibit will be is given by the Nevada
City Transcript:
"Every branch of the gold mining in
dustry will be represented in a practical
and attractive way. There will h<- a
pumping and hoisting plant and a quartz
mill in constant operation, with electrici
ty as a motive power; a tunnel, showing
the hanging wall, footwall, gouge, ledge,
and other characteristics of a typical
Nevada County gold mine; scores of tons
of gold-bearing ores from various parts
of the county; great dumps of auriferous
gravel, with live, genuine miners pan
ning out the royal metal: hundreds of
pounds of marvelous gold nuggets from
quartz and gravel claims; beautiful crys
tals, of all shapes and sizes; the products
of the rich copper mines in the lower
part of the county; large photographs of
the surface and underground workings
of many of our great producers; a mam
moth map, showing the location of every
claim in the county; big cakes of ice
from the eastern end of the county, and
branches of luscious oranges from the
Pet Hill district; cuts from the great
forests around Truckee, and mammoth
apples and pears and other hardy fruits
from the middle altitudes.
"All these, and many other things, will
be shown from the gem county of Cali
fornia â the county that has not only the
greatest gold mines, but grows the best
fruit and lumber and other products to
be found in all the wide West."

of them will come in the future some
mines as rich and famous as any on the
mother lode. Developments of greater
present importance are constantly being
noted
During the week the largest single bul
lion shipment ever made from Jackson
left that town. It amounted to $: â¢
and came from the Zeila, Kennedy and
Argonaut mines.
The Cherokee mine, near Angels Camp.
in Tuolumne County, has bf-en Bold by R.
B. Prince to a company of Stockton "cap
italists for $75,000. Stockton men are put
ting money into mother lode mines at a
rapid rate.
The Arbona mine, situated at Tuttle
town, Tuolumne County, is sinking a
shaft at the rate of three feet a day, and
the owners of the mine say that the anx
iety for the success of the mine as a
money maker has all disappeared. A
blast was put In a body of ore in a tun
nel the other day which loosened rock
from which about $100 in gold was taken.
The Norwegian of the Tuttletown group
is showing some very rich rock, and the
preparations for extensive spring work
are under way.
The Marryat. situated on the mother
lode, east of the Arbona, has just com
pleted a twenty stamp mill, which will be
started up In a day or two on a consid
erable quantity of gold bearing quartz.
The AUimeda, also of this group. Bltu
: ated south of the Arbona, is also figuring
on putting up a mill in the near future.
The Lightner, adjoining the T'tica. at
; Angels, which has been working a four
! stamp mill, will soon have a twenty
i stamp crushing plant in operation. Bey-
I eral Stocktonians are interested in this
property.
A strike of rich ore In a new ledge on
i the 200 level of the Unity mine, Grass Val
i ley, is one of the finds of the week. The
â  shift is down 3CO feet, and a new level
j will be run.
The perpendicular shaft at the Texas
j mine is now down 160 feet, and a steam
: pump has just been put in.
Progressive work is going on at the
Wisconsin mine at Grans Valley, and the
I outcome is very gratifying to the owners.
A recent crushing of forty-five loads paid
. at the rate of $44 per load, and the rock
! came from Xo. 5 in the south drift. New
; pumps arc being placed In the mine and
the property is now well on Its way to
itÂ« golden glory.
Work on the Gothard. torethor with the
Delhi, at Columbia Hill, Nevada County.
i recently purchased by the Champion
: Company for $25,000, is progressing rapid
ly. Superintendent Bigelow has eleven
men at work, and will increase the force
as circumstances permit. The old 1000
foot tunnel is being extended 500 feet,
and will cut the vein at a depth of over
â¢ 800 feet.
! The two eight-foot Pelton wheels for the
| Phoenix mine, Nevada County, have ar
rived and been put in place. The new
hoisting and pumping machinery will be
started up this week.
Good gravel has been struck at the
Reddlck mine, Nevada County, and the
â  property is more than meeting the run
ning expenses.
I At the Round Butte gTavel mine a mon
; itor is in place for hydraulii king. A dam
! has been built on O'Neil Creek, and a
I permit has been secured. The mine is
! one mile west of Sheep Ranch, Calaveras
i County.
The Sellier gravel mine has leaped to
the front, according to the Colfax Sen
tinel. The tunnel, which is in 430 feet,
reached the other day a fine body of blue
gravel which is believed to be a con
tinuation of the famous Red Point lead.
I Tunneling has been stopped to build a
' dump and otherwise prepare for washing
the gravel. A fine equipment for operat
ing the mine will be put in.
The wonderful awakening in the min
ing industry in Tuolumne in the last year

The Ne Plus Ultra Copper mlie. be
' tween Berenda and Raymond, in Madera
; County, is reported sold to Stockton peo
ple: price $15,000. The mine was closed
! down in 1577 owing to the low price of

manded by the railroad company. In j

chase, under a contract, resumed work on
the mine, and the results were so satis

Notes.
Shasta County Supervisors have decided
not to appropriate any money to aid an
j exhibit at the Mining Fair and whatever
i is done for It will be due to private en
terprise.
Another big ledge of base ore has been
discovered in the Backbone mining dis-
I trict in Shasta County. About a month
j ago George F. Graves and William Gllon.
I the well-known miners, discovered the
1 ledge, but they did not make their find
! known until last we<>k.
The ore body is sixty-five feet in width
' and shows very fine cropplngs. The ore
\ on th<Â» surface assays $7 per ton in gold
and silver and V-k per cent In copper.

The wisdom of the commercial bodies
â¢which created the Alaska trade com
mittee for the purpose of advertising
the city and port of San Francisco as
the best outfitting p<int on the Coast
for people who will po to the Klondike
in the spring becomes more manifest
every day. The exhibit at the ferry
depot and the social carload of neces
saries for the north, which was sent to
Chicago, have attracted so much at
tention that already hundreds of people
from all parts of the Union have de
cided to secure their supples here. This
till that by the time the main rush J
i omes in the spring money will flow |
freely into the pockets of those who
contributed to the project. Had It not
beed for this move at the time it took ;
place all of this patronage would have
gone to the northern cities.
That these are facts is shown by the i
;â¢! â¢ ts recently received by the local I
secretary from those in charge of the
bureau in Chicago. This is in effect
that in the spring hundreds of people
bound for the Klondike will come by
the way of this city if they can secure
accommodations on the steamers that
run direct from this port to Alaska.
They desire to avoid unnecessary delay
and know that it is safer to get their
berths in San Francisco before leaving
their homes than to go to shipping
points first and secure their passage
later. Arrangements will be made by
the committee to secure all the accom
modations necessary to fill the require
ments of those who will make their de
parture from this city.

Entered Rugs Fraudulently.
A libel of infomation was filed yester
day in the United States District Court
against If. B. Mihran, a local merchant,
charging him with defrauding the Gov
ernment by fraudulent invoice. In July
of last year he imported from Turkey
thirty-five Oriental rugs, four mats and
ninety-eijjht portieres, which he repre
sented as being worth about $290, upon
which duty was paid. It transpired upon
subsequent examination, however, that
the goods were worth about $500. and
they were accordingly seized, and the
District Court requested to issue an or
der of forfeiture.

OUR WHIST QUEEN IN MOURNING.
Few that will read these lines but
will in their hearts feel sad for a few
moments at least when they learn that
death has entered the home of Miss
Kato Wheelock, known the world over
as the Whist Queen. C. L. Wheelock,
father of Miss Kate, died at his home in j
Milwaukee, Wis.. on December 20, in his
seventy-third year. He passed away
surrounded by his family. We extend to
Miss Wheelock our condolence and heart
felt sympathy in her hour of sorrow. If
wo and the thousands of othor warm
friends Miss Wheelock has made on the
Pacific Coast could place a little flower
on the grave of her dear father a mound
would be raised, the fragrance of which
could be no sweeter nor tasting than the
pleasant recollections of Miss Wheeloek's
last visit among her legion of whist
friends in California,
WHIST, OR PRIVATE CONVENTIONS?
It Is getting to be quite the custom
nowadays in certain whist circles in the
East for the loser of a match to charge
the players of an opposing team that
adopts a system of play not known or
understood by their adversaries as using
private conventions. It so happened after
a whist match in Philadelphia a few
weeks ago. A club that are still wearing
their whist kilts sent in a challenge for
the American Whist League trophy, and
when their turn came to play ran up
Piinst the hard-hitting Philadelphia
b team, and lost the match, of course,
i went home and pleaded the baby act
trying to explain their defeat. There
is no team in the American Whist League
that are truer sports or more upright,
honorable or square in their whist play
and stick closer to the written and un
written whist law than this Philadelphia
team that was so cruelly charged with
using other than fair methods to win.
The trouble with the players who make
thtse charges is they are ignorant of
the subject they are talking about.
If I should start out for San Fran
cisco with a whist team and play a
match game in every large whist club In
the United States, and adopt for our
system of play in the minutest detail
that which is laid down in General A.
W*. Dray son's fifth edition of the "Art of
Practical Whist," and if we did not ex
plain this system to the players we came
in contact with, in our opinion there
would not be five clubs on our whole trip
that would understand this system in all
its phases. We have never met in all
our travels one team that did, and as a
system entire in itself there is none
better. A whist player to be up to date
should be a student; he should read the
whist literature of the past as well as nf
the present. There is an endless variety
of books written on the game, and in our
whist archives we have a description of
at least forty different games called
whist, each with a system of play of its
own. Haven't we the right to play any
of these systems if, we want to? Most
assuredly we have. What Is It in the

ordinary walks of life that makes a man !
be railed brilliant? Is it because the
suit <>f .lot h<s he wears shines? Some so- j
called whist players might think so. Or j
is it because he is full of learning in his j
chosen profession, and hafl a charming, i
magnetic way of using and imparting
it to others when occasion calls for it?
So in whist, a player of the first rank is
one who commenced at the bottom and
step by step worked his way to the top,
and one who is thoroughly familiar with
all known authorities, systems of play
advocated by such authorities, nc?w and
old, and at the whist table has a defense
for every attack. One who meets you on
any grounds you chouse to select; one
who can use a rapier as well as a broad
sword, can parry and thrust, in other
words give you a royal battle of brain
against brain. Such players have no use
for private conventions and should not be
charged with using such.
SOLUTION OFTHEWHITFIELD PROBLEM.
Published in the Cell December 28.
â¢We have received several communi
cations in regard to this problem, some
asking the question if it is possible to
solve It and others sending in solutions.
We have received only one that is cor
rect. It is from Hugo Kuhl of Indio,
Riverside County.
His solution follows: North leads
ace of hearts. South plays the jack.
North leads a spade. South trumps and
leads a trump on which North discards
the ten of diamonds. The balance is
simple. Mr. Hugo rightly says tho
"key move" consists in South playing
the "jack on North's lead of ace of hearts
and North's discard of ten of diamonds
on Souths lead of trumps.
The Alameda Club paid a friendly visit
to the Trist Duplicate Whist Club Friday
evening last. A match game of twenty
four deals was played and resulted in a
victory for the Trist club by a gain of
10 tricks.
The Linda Vista Club of Oakland does
not want us to tell what it did New
Year's eve. After it was announced
that Mrs. Hubbard and Mr. Whitman
had won the last prize of the year by
making the ton score, an adjournment
was taken to the dining room, where a
watch meeting was held until the "wee
sma' hours" of the morning.
OLYMPICS WIN.
Kjot Contest at recreation Park. |
for the Light-Weight Cham-
The final game for the light-weight
football championship was played on
the gridiron at Recreation Park yester
day.
The contesting teams were the Olym
pics, formerly the Y. M. C. A. team,
and the Alameda Centerville Athletic
eleven.
As the two teams had met in contest
before a hot game was expected.
About 3 o'clock the two teams lined up
for battle. Evans made the kick-off for
the Olympic and the ball was run into
touch by Blakow.
After some good hard playing on both
sides, where the team work of the
Olympics showed to particular advan
tage, the ball was pushed over for a
touch-down, which Evans converted
into a goal.
The first half was short and ended
with the ball in the hands of the Olym
pics.
The second half opened with Center
ville's kick-off, which was returned by
Evans.
The honors of the game from this
time on were about evenly divided, un

ion, when the Centerville boys seemed
to liven up a little â but too late for
victory. The Olympic got possession of
the ball and Centerville was compelled
to make a safety.
The game ended with the score of six
to two in favor of the Olympips, who
carried off with their victory the un
disputed lipht-weight championship.
The attendance, considering the rain,
was unusually good.
