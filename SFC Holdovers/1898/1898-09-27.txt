Up to Public Gaze the Errors
and Isms of Maguire.
SAN DIEGO, Sept. 26.â Gage is all
right. Ten thousand people as
sembled in San Diego to-night
bo avowed by their cheer? for the
Republican nominee for Governor.
The meeting in point of attendance
and enthusiasm broke the record of po
litical demonstrations In this county.
All the space of the Plaza was occu
pied by attentive listeners, and the
throng extended far beyond on the
roadway, and on the sidewalk:: of D
street north and on Fourth street, east
of the Plaza, stood a multitude eager to
hear the words of the eloquent stand
ard bearer of the Republican party in
this campaign.
Early in the day regular and special
tratiia j>rtva.t* tpnveyances brought
from adjacent towns and the environs
of the city many voters who were ani
mated by a desire to participate in the
great outpouring of the masses; to hear
Mr. Gage and listen to the matchless
General Barnes in his eloquent flights
of oratory.
The first feature of San Diego's wel
ccmie and demonstration in honor of
Mr. Gage was a reception at the Horton
House, which commenced at 2 p. m.
and closed at 4 p. in.
Mr. Gage during that time met fully
1000 of the leading citizens of the coun
ty, both Republicans and Democrats.
They were presented by A. G. Gassen,
and passed a few words with the candi
date for Governor. For two hours the
throng of visitors kept up. There was
no cessation. At 4 p. m. Mr. Gage was
compelled to retire and obtain a needed
rest. Among the more prominent citi
zens who met Mr. Gage were the fol
lowing:

.Interest in the great events of the
flay Increased as the hours of evening
approached. The plaza band stand was
decorated with the national colors. Be
fore 7 o'clock the peopue began to as
semble at the appointed place. The
City Guard band discoursed patriotic
airs, as the people came together.
It was remarked by some as a phenom
enal; display and others a a happy
promise of Republican victory.
The colors red, white and blue in a
circle around the moon were plainly
visible. The multitude was called to
order by Samuel F. Smith, chairman of
the Republican County Central Com
mittee, who introduced U. S. Grant as
chairman. Mr. Grant in accepting the"
honor said: ) -

! by menns other than words I may attest
the measure of my appreciation.
Fellow citizens, we are here to-night to
meet two gTeat apostles who will preach
! and interpret the great doctrines of our
i grand oid party. They will tell us how
J the party has kept Its pledges to the
people, and, if any of you have strayed
into strange political paths, to set signal
lights and guide you Dack to where you
belong. The Republican party has more
1 nearly kept its faith with the people, has
! more nearly solved the problems of the
i hour, to the satisfaction of the people,
, than has any other party in America.
i There never has been a crisis in the his
' tory of America since the birth of the
: Republican party when the people have
not called, upon the party to solve It.
: There never has been a crisis when the
I party has shirked its duty or been unequal
Ito the task. Recently when a foreign
I enemy threatenedâ when at our doors
! there arose a condition of affairs that
was deplorable, intolerable, disgraceful to
| civilizationâ President McKinley, with . a
calm dignity, typical of a great, nation,
. grasped the., helm and *rui<!eil us throuKh
: a. sea of. trouble, the full dangers where
, of will probably never -be known to'us.ii*"
In our friend and neighbor, whom we
will .delight to honor and whom we al
â â  ready respect; we have the local repre
! sentatlve of â  our party, the spokesman,
1 the chosen standard bearer. When he oc
i cupies the gubernatorial chair, as he sure
! ly will, he will not- try his hand at formu
; lating strange methods of taxation, nor
will wild thtories of government engross
his time. He will be guided by the well-
I known, soundly-seasoned .principles" of a
party which does not remodel its . plat
form to catch the votes of those who
struggle after new delusions.
I have the pleasure of introducing to
| you the honorable Henry T. Gage.
The Introduction of Mr. Gage was the
! signal for great applause. As the
standard bearer stepped forward the
| vast multitude gave him mighty shouts
j of welcome. -Mr. Gage spoke as fol
j lows:
It must be a cold heart that does not
respond to the greeting of friend and
nolirhhnr Ttlf S:ltlS-
factions of -lfe are
largely wrought out
of the human rela
tions which interest
us In the happiness of
others. To feel the
pain and share the
pleasure of a friend is
man's most remied
privilege.

The Birth
The Party.
Indeed, in this regard for others is the
origin of all right personal and public ac
tion. While 1 am thrilled by this grand
demonstration, its suggestions almost
I sadden me with the sense of responsi
bility which it brings. The hailing of a
fellow-citizen by the people who intend
to make him their servant In a public sta
tion is a feature almost peculiarly Ameri
can. So 1 see here and now evidences of
the great underlying principles of this
tree government.
The constitution was Intended to secure
that civil equality asserted by the Dec
laration of Independence, and when some
I timid and many wise statesmen had by
I repeated compromises held that Intention
1 in abeyance the Republican party sprang
into being. It had no part in the com
promises of the past. It looked beyond
them to the principles of the constitution
and declared that its gift of civil equality
should no longer be withheld. In its day
this declaration was the sounding of the
tocsin. War came and made the years
lurid, but through all the shock and
shouting, the battle cloud and thunder,
where men died in scores of thousands
and where others formed In fresh bat
talions to replace them, the banner of this
party shone like a sunburst through the
shadows, and its legend ran, '"All men are
created equal." When the strife was over
that which was the dream of Jefferson
and the Inspiration of Lincoln had been
written in the living law, and all men had
their constitutional inheritance of civil
equality.
The party which has put its standard
into my hands, by your favor and help to
be carried to victory, stands to-day in
its maturity for the principles to which
it was dedicated in its Infancy. If those
who Btood sponsors at its baptism wore
called to answer for the high pledge they
gave in its name, they could point to it^s
Faithful record and be justified. It i'fls,
every moment of its existence, put man
and his interests foremost among the
things of its concern. Man is the la
borer: his toll precedes capital. Para
lyze his arm or take the light and im
pulse of hope from his heart and the cre
ation of wealth ceases. Deprive him of
his Just share of what he creates and
you dim the eye of his faith in freedom
and his fellow man. Therefore, this
party which commits to us its fate and
fortunes In California, charged Itself with
the high duty of protecting labor as the
creator of capital, and the story of its
stewardship is written in the progressive
rise in the nominal value of wages and
a constant increase in their purchasing
power over the necessaries of life.
Admonished by tho interests of fifteen
millions of wage earners, who are our
fellow citizens, enjoying with us their
enfranchisement in the civil equality we
fought for, our party haa said that there
shall be no rich man's money and poor
man's money, but that there shall be but
one kind of money, and that the best in
the world. The coin that pays the un
earned salary of a king is none too good
to pay the well earned wages of an
American laborer.
In this we do but follow our baptismal
pledge of equality. We want no classl
â¢ieation of society along the lines of cur
rency. Our national affairs are springing
into order. While our soldiers and sail
ors have been following the flag to vic
tory on land and sea, our mechanics,
farmers and merchants have wrought in
I the ways of peace to extend our com
i merce with the nations, and at the end
of the .first year of trade under a Repub.

PICTORIAL STORY OF THE GREAT REPUBLICAN RALLY f?T SAN DIEGO.
Hon. Henry T. Gage addresses the assembled multitudes, while seated upon the speakers' stand
are U. S. Grant, General W. H. L. Barnes and other distinguished representatives of the Republican party.
balance of $800,000,000, and for the first
time in our hlnory we can claim to bo
the creditor nation, while the world is
our debtor.
The principles upon which the party
has acted in securing these results are
not changed for expediency. Asserting
the right of American labor to defense
against a low standard of life, we were
beaten in 1890. In 1892 we again gave bat
i tie in defense of Americn labor and wore
I beaten. Then silence fell upon Ameri
can worshops and dust and rust beset
their sleeping wheels. Capital no longer
I sought enterprises for investment.
Money no longer circulated and business
houses fell all over the land as if at
tacked at once by earthquake and cyclone.
Then men discovered that Ingenuity has
no device for securing the circulation of
money equal to the payment of wages to
j well-employed labor. When the great
i army of lifteen millions of laborers ceased
I to earn, money ceased to circulate and
business shriveled like a rose exposed
to our hot blasts from the north.
Again the Republican party asserted
the rights of labor to employment, to
good wages paid in gqjftd money, and in
I 1896 it won a victory by putting expedi
ency behind it and persisting in the pur
poses and principles which it was cre
ated to sustain.
Let us stand by it now. Let us not
; forget that we had allies In 1896 who saw
! danger in the Chicago, .platform and
helped defeat it. Confronted by the sinis
ter policies now put in issue In California,
we invite to our side all men who distin
guish between party name and party
principles, who will lend a hand in bat
tle which involves even more than the
issues of 1596.
The fusion candidate, who appeals to
prejudice against the Republican ticket,
j and the convention which nominated it,
by no means confines his campaign of
prejudice to partisan attack. He appeals
to the prejudice that may be latent in.
the community against those who have
accumulated property by thrift and In-
I dustry. He rousee those who have failed
1 against those who have succeeded. He
! appears, as he tells his audiences, as the
j champion of the poor against the rich,
nnd In effect, affirms that his election is
necessary to end the aggressions of tha
property-holding class. His cry is calam
ity and loss of manhood's opportunity, and
his campaign is a general arraignment of
the social state.
Now I deny that the people of this
country have bo slept upon their r!ghts
that the aggressions of wealth have clos
| ed the door of opportunity to the thrifty
j and Industrious. The rich men of to
â  day were the poor men of thirty years
ago, and the poor men of to-day will be
the rich men of the future. It is peculiarly
I to the credit of our Institutions that the
discipline of poverty fits men for for
tune by training in that self-denial that
leads from dependence to independence.
In what other country do an many la
boring men own their own homes? In
what other country are as many labor
ers depositors in savings banks?
In wnat other country may the poorest
! boy hope for as high a destiny as in this
republic?
Why. in our American cities the very
scavengers that take the refuse from our
stables and kitchens nwn homes and bank
deposits. Of what other country can this
1 be said?
The harm done by such theories as
Judge Maguire stands for Is that they in
duce the rising generation to look for
ward to a Utopia, in which the statute
law Is to be every man shall have what
he wants without thfc energy, exertion and
character, which are now and always will
be the elements of success In life.
I All of the theories and isms of which fu
i slon Democracy has become the guardian
I tend to degrade life, set up artificial
I classes that have no excuse for existence
here, and when society has been artln
1 daily classified to set class against class.
Mr. Gage devoted considerable time
to a discussion of Maguire's pretended
railroad issue, and quoted from the
Congressional Record. On this point he
said:
But, fellow citizens, the new Democracy
must endeavor to have a popular issue,
even if they be com-
pelled to invent one.
5.1r. Maguire, there
fore, as the head of
that party, has resur
rected the old anti
railroad cry. and is

this weil-worn shout
of the office-seekers.

by the Populists and prior to his nom
ination by th* Fusion Democracy and
Fusion Silver party, Mr. Maguire, her
alded by the blare of demagogic
mouths, returned to San Francisco
from Washington. He received a great
ovation. He marched through the streets
like a Roman conqueror and exhibited
himself publicly as the people's savior,
the great enemy of Huntlngton and the
Southern Pacific Railroad. He spoke at
Metropolitan Hall in the city of San Fran
cisco on August 9 of this year and de
nounced in bitter language an existing
law of the United States, approved July
7, IS9B, which is entitled "An Act Making
Appropriation to Supply Deficiencies in
the Appropriations for the Fiscal Year
Ending June 30, IS9S, and for Other Pur

a settlement with the Central Pacific and
Western Pacific railroads for the purpose

Not content with denouncing Hunting

one of the most distinguished Senators of
the Democratic party, the old ideal of

not satisfy the single-taxer, for he wan

paign, even if it were to be believed only

Populists and Sflverites In the United
States Senate. In order to keep the peo
ple in reverential awe of his railroad
scare-crow in his speech he not only did
not hesitate to exclude the true facts, but
even went so far as to make a misstate
mentâ namely. th>t but one Democrat
voted for the amendment. I quote the
words from his party paper, the Exam
iner which certainly would not, in its
nart'lsan zeal, do him the injustice of
either spoiling his rhetoric or his facts.
He said:
"The measure could never have suc
ceeded but for the weakness of Mr. Bar
ham and the weakness of Mr. Loud.
Mr Loud did not vote for the bill. He
was paired, but he was paired with a
Democrat, and he could not have been
paired but as a supporter of the bill, for
there was but one Democrat in the Houfie
â Bankhead of Alabamaâ who was for the
bill."
Here are three errors which Mr. Ma
ffulre seeks to Impress upon the peanla:
First, that the amendment which he
styles the funding amendment was a Re
publican party measure (when it was not
such and was passed through the aid of
but one Democrat: second, that the
amendment could not have passed but for
the weakness, as he styles it, of his fel
low Republican Representatives from
this State; third, that the provisions of
the law are so exceedingly shocking to
the people and so advantageous to the
raflroad, that the people of this State and
of the United States will be unscrupulous
ly robbed.
A plain statement of the plain facts
learned from records of both houses of
Congress will tear the clotht-s from the
scarecrow and exhibit the fanciful feat
ures of Mr. Maguire in his character of a
political Grimaldl, endeavoring to divert
public attention while he attempts U>
clamber into office. Let us first read tire
dreadful amendment. 1 nssure you, fel
low-citizens, it won't devour you.
The "funding amendment" is styled In
the deficiency appropriation bill the "set
tlement with the Central Pacific and
Western Pacific railroads."
The text of the bill was read by Mr.
Gage, and at the conclusion he contin
ued his comments as follows:
Now, fellow citizens, was this a Repub
lican bill? We always designate the par
tisan character of a bill by the politics
of Its proposer and the strongest sup
porter. Who is the Democratic' leader
of his party in the United States to-day?
Who stands, even with the new Democ
racy, among the highest in his ranks as
the defender of Jefferson's principles?
Clearly, Senator John T. Morgan of Ala-
He (Senator Morgan) introduced this
same bill, this so-called refunding amend
ment, this dreadful moasvire denounced
by Mr. Maguire, denounced by the fusion
Democracy, denounced by the fusion Pop
ulists, but not condemned by the fusion
silver platform.
Certainly the Democratic Senator from
this State ranks high in his party as the
exponent of the new Democracy, and as
the avowed enemy of railroads in this
State. He voices the new Democracy
here and throughout the nation, and yet,
fellow citizens. Hon. Stephen M. White,
the Democratic Senator, was the one who,
in the Senate, shaped the hated fund
ing amendment Into its present condi
tion, and he, the distinguished Demo
cratic Senator, supported Senator Morgan
in its passage through the Senate.
W T ho passed the terrible bill? It was
passed by the entire Senate without a
single objection from either Populist, fu
sionist or Democrat.
And again, fellow citizens a part of
this funding amendment, a clause in thjs
settlement with the railroad, which lim
ited Its acceptance to a period of one
year, wns prepared and inserted In Ihe
bill at the instance of a Republican of
this State, namely, Congressman Barham
of the First Congressional District. In
the House, not one (as Mr. Maguire says),
but two Democrats and one Populistâ
namely. Congressmen Berry. Bankhead
and Green â voted for the bill. Mr. Ma
guire also forgets to tell the people that
twenty-one Republicans voted against it
and Ij3 Representatives, of all shades of
political opinion, refrained from voting.
If Mr. Maguire's memory be at fault
again, lot him consult the Congressional
Record of date July 6, 1898, page 7515.
Fellow citizens, these are the facts. I
quote in support of the view that the
bill is not of so corrupt a character as
is. stated by Maguire the following re
marks in approval of this bill by the
Democratic Senator. Morgan, from the
Congressional Record, volume 31, number
152. paces 7250 and 7251:
â  J "â  .' -' ' ''
"Nevertheless, I am quite satisfied that
no Congress will sit here that will depart
from the precedent
that has been estab
lished in the case of
the Union Pacific
Railway Company.
The country has be
come, as I have re
marked,so entirely sat
isfied with that set
tlement that here
after there will be no
serious question made anywhere as to its
validity as a precedent for the settlement
of the Central Pacific debt."
Mr. Morgan
Versus
Maguire.
Mr. Gage quoted another paragraph
from the speech of Senator Moreran as
reported in the Congressional Record.
Special emphasis was given to the fol
lowing declaration of the Alabama Sen
ator: .
"The settlement proposed here leaves all
of the acts of Congress In full force,
leaves the charter in full force and the
obligations of the Central Pacific entirely
unaffected by this legislation; and in that
respect the advantages of this settlement
are immensely greater than those of the
settlement we have already made with the
Union Pacific Railway Company."
Our Democratic Senator's (White) opin
ion was asked by Senator Bacon before
the passage of the bill as follows:
Mr. Baconâ l desire to ask the Senator
from California a question, for all the ex
planation we have had on this matter
has necessarily been limited to one read-
Ing of it. I desire to know whether, un
der the provisions of this amendment,
which has been adopted, the parties who
are charged with the responsibility and
power of this settlement will be author
ized to take anything less than the
amount of the principal and interest?
Mr. Spoonerâ No.
Mr. Baconâ l asked for information, as
I coulft not Judge from the reading.
Mr. Whiteâ l desire to say to the Sen
ator fi;om Georgia that as the amend
ment is now amended it provides for the
payment of the full amount; and an
otiier amendment, which was adopted by
the Senate at my suggestion, limits the
final payment to ten years, and a default
as to any payment of principal or inter
est will make the whole due and rayablo
forthwith.
The foregoing I have read from page \
7254 of the Congressional Record, volume
31. number 152. Now where is Mr. Ma- |
gulre's scarecrow? Where Is his railroad i
thunder? Which party representatives
fostered and fathered this frightful
"funding amendment," those of the new
or the old Democracy? The Pemocrncy
from which Mr. Maguire withdrew in ISS7
or the new and changed Democracy. ,
which returned to him and embraced him
In IS9S?
When a false issue is raised, when a
misstatement is made to the people, it
rapidly travels, and It takes a wealth of |
argument to disarm the people of their
prejudices.
Fellow-citizens, publish these facts to |
your friends and neighbors. Read them
for yourselves in the public records, and i
the next time you hear Mr. MagÂ«ire :
raising his voice against railroads kindly
ask him to produce the Congressional
Record and read the Senate proceedings
upon this "funding amendment" which
Mr. Maguire and his party now bo stren
uously condemn. This amendment has*
now become a law, and Its execution de- ;
volves upon the President of the United
States to carry out the spirit and letter
of the law passed by both houses of Con
gress.
Will you trust the faithful execution
of that law to your President, or will
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
you give ear to the anti-railroad speeches
of Mr. Maguire? Will you ta-ke the'testi
mony of the great Democratic Senator
Morgan, arid that of your auie'and hon
ored Democratic Senator White, or will
you accept the political, pre-election de
nunciation of the opposing candidate for
office? . â¢
He made no objection to- Mr. Barham's
amendment at the time it was proposed
and had he then offered an objection
thereto this amendment could not have
been considered nor could it have become
law: and to prove this. I here read what
is reported in the Congressional Record
upon this subject.
Mr. Gage hear read the proceedings
in the House upon the amendment of
fered by Congressman Barham to tha
Senate amendments, showing no ob
jection was then made.
It appears from page 7515,-just read, that
when the speaker pro tern. of the House
asked the whole House of Representatives
(Mr. Maguire being present), "Is there
any objection?" there was nb objection.
But suppose he had made" objection to it;
suppose he did vote against the funding
amendment â what matters it when we re
member that the amendment presented so
many excellent features that every Dem
ocratic, Populist and Republican Senator
voted for it? When did Mr. Maguire be
come possessed of mere honesty and
greater wisdom than all the Senators of
the United States?
After disposing of the railroad ques
tion Mr. Gage turned the searchlight on
Maguire's war record. Said he: â¢
Mr. Maguire has a war record. It is
such as a Spaniard would have'- been
proud 'of had he occu
pied . Mr. Maguire's
seat in the House. Mr.
Maguire is also proud
of that record and is
correspondingly sensi
tive upon the subject
of his priue. He com
plained of some words
of mine uttered In an

and His
War Record.!
aanrtss in L.os Ange
les, wherein I said that he (Maguire) had
voted in a direction opposite to that in
which the American bullets were flying,
and called upon me for the record. . I will
give it to tim.
When the House bill 10.550, intended to
enable volunteer soldiers during the war
with Spain to vote at Congressional elec
tions, came up for action before the
House. Mr. J.Jaguire, who had previously
expressed himself as hostile to the bill,
answered "Present" and refused to vote
for the bill. Lest the honorable Congress
man should forget this matter" I call his
attention to the Congressional Record of
June 10. 1898. pages 6390 and 6391. But
through the patriotism of the Republicans
in the House, who believed that the vol
unteer who goes forth to battle for his
country should not be disfranchised the
bill passed the House.
Mr. Maguire and his party have made
the war revenue bill an issueâ a measuro
passed by Republican patriotism.' through
the Senate and House and approved by
our loyal American President. This
measure, while onerous upon the people
as all systems of taxation must be, was
one of the necessities of the hour. I
firmly believe that the people of Cali
fornia of every political faith. whoSe age,
health, business and other ties require
their services .at home do not begrudge
a single dollar of tax which goes to fur
nish the Government with revenue to
arm. feed, clothe and pay our gallant sol
diers and sailors. I do not believe that
the paltry clamor of partisans about the
hardship of a war tax will abate one2
iota the true Callfornlan's loyalty and
love of country.
Mr. Majjuire. himself admits and glo
ries in tho fact that he voted against tho
war revenue bill. Now, is not tnis voting
against the- interests of his country? Can
a Spaniard be found who would not ap
plaud Mr. Maguire's vote upon this bill
which armed and equipped for war our
soldiers and tailor*:' If our loyal citi
zens, rich and pool-, have not complained
of the harsh necessities of tr.e hour, wh\'
should the unpatriotic of the Democracy
attempt to make this an issu".
Mr. Siaguire opposed the issuance of
bands necessary to carry on the war in
this, that he insisted that the bonds is
sued by the Government should not bo
interest-bearing, thereby preventing their
acceptance by. or sale to, the people.
Lest Mr. Magulre should deny the truth !
of tins statement. I refer to his support j
Of -Mr. Bland's amendment reported in
volume 31, number 104 of the Congres
sional Record, -April 29, 1&98, where, on
â >H4 >f the Record, Mr. Maguire
Bays:
"Mr. Chairman: I desire to say sim

i" n "is. andj fiat being- tru". certainly a
proposition to issue non-interest-bc-aring j
obligations for toe same purpose as that
contemplated by the bill would be in or
der as a substitute, as it simply eilmi
nates the interest-bearing proposition."
Mr. Maguire knev.". as a lawyer and j
business man, that the issuance of each
bonds v ould render them unsalable. He '
kn< w that if the bonds were at all to be
bought by the people that they would i
be purchased only at a discount com*J
BUrate with an interest depending*!
upon times of payment. Knowing this, I
was his action not opposed to the expend- i
iture of money for Government us"<* in ;
the war against Spain? Was he not then ;
voting in a direction opposite to that In I
which American bullets were flying?
A government cannot create gold and
silver. It cannot dig the earth for the)
precious metals. It cannot force the
commercial world to accept its non-Inter- j
tearing obligations for the products
ol labor. Laborers cannot pay their :
.debts with indefinite non-negotiable
promises to pay, and no government liat
would keep such paper at par in trrt>
commercial world. The Populistlc gov
ernmental theory of- flooding the commer- ]
clal world with unlimited paper money j
has long since been exploded and even I
war necessities would not give sufficient
nourishment to the rag baby to keÂ«p it !
alive a month. The Government, there j
fore, must raise the revenue both by tax- I
ation and sale of bonds, and the non
isouari * of bonds tv meet the enormous
v.ar expenditure would have more than j
doubled* the -taxation upon the present
generation.
Mr. Magture, as an Intelligent man
knew this; yet, disregarding the fact and
trusting to deceive, perhaps, the people
ifornia as to the real aspect of the I
question, and. if possible, to make his
party standing stronger, knowing that !
taxes of nU kinds, and especially war;
-â . are onerous, he appealed to the :
country by voting with his party against
the war revenue bill, on the plea that thu
burden of taxation fell upon the poor.
Yet the very money to be raised by this i
bi.ll \v;'s to be paid by the people at large !

gallant soldier, sons of the poor, and for
â  ammunition to use against the common

Lin I ask was not this voting in a
direction opposite to that from which |
American bullets wen- flying?
In the course of his further remarks, I
Mr. Gage thanked the people erf San ,
Diego for the support given to him in
the convention at Sacramento, which j
honored him with the nomination for]
rnor. He promised, if elected, to
give the people of California a clean, j
economic, businesslike administration. \
The address delivered by Mr. Gage i
was received with many expressions of
cheering approval. He Rains in force â 
;i ml effect as the campaign progresses.
Interruptions do not embarrass him, j
but on the contrary stimulate him. He !
was interrupted by questions several
times to-night and replied so readily
and courteously that he gained the
commendation of- his hearers. He was
constrained to- abridge his speech in]
order to allow time for General Barnes
to speak.
The introduction of General W. H. L,. j
Barnes was. the signal for a storm of â 
applause long continued. U. 8. Grant
presented, the matchless orator with fe- :
lk-ity of expression. He referred to the :
general as the genius of Oratory who j
deserved at the hands of the Republi
can party anything he should ask.
General Barnes spoke for an hour .
and a half, holding the audierce by the
charm of his eloquence. The telling
points â and there were many â were re
ceived with cheers. The audience, in- j
teMgent and alert, quickly caught the I
meaning and spirit of his remarks be- [
fore the conclusion of a sentence.
Ral i began to descend In showers as
the general was speaking, but hie hear
ers were so deeply Interested that they
remained, eager to hear every word of i
his masterly appeal to the patriotism j
and intelligence of the masses. Ma- |
gulre received from the to vnerai what ;
the Little -Giant has long deserved â a I
scorching g..0il roast for his anarch- !
istic, nihilistic, socialistic, single tax j
and demagogic utterances. In the
Course Of his speech he said:

iKHiHHaMiMi | Ing now encased in
doing the bidding of
the Southern Pacific Company, and as one i
who has do other nreans of subsistence, i
and claims that when I put up my peti
tion to be given this day my daily bread,
1 address myself to Mr. Huntington, and
.not to the great Bread Utver, I venture
to make a few observations before pro- '
ceeding to the discussion of questions
which really should occupy the attention ,
of every man who enters upon the public
discussion of public i issues. The entire j
basis of Mr. Maguire's assault upon me
is found in the fart that I have accepted
retainers in litigated cases, and have ap- '
peared in the courts of this State on be- â 
half of the Southern Pacific Company.
For a number of years I have bgen in
the employ of this company in a profes- I
sional way. but. as the company knows
and as everybody else who knows me is
aware, my retainer has always stopped i
at the Courthouse door. I have never i
been in politics with the company nor for '
the company. If, as Magufre says, it at- I
tempts to or does dominate the Repub
lican party, I know nothing of the fact.
I have never been In its political confi
dence If it haa any to award. I have never
discussed a political question or a poli
tician with any officer of the company,
and. so far as public matters are con
cerned, I am as free as any other cit
izen lof this State. .
Nobody knows this better than James
Q. Maguire. . I have enjoyed more or
less his acquaintance Â« for the last nine
teen years, and have watched his polit- !
ical antics- with considerable interest. If
he was not a sand-lotter, â  one of those
disturbers of the public peace, who in
tho latter part of the seventies, gave the
police of San Francisco bo much to do,
he was politically - born upon the sand
lot at about the same time when the in.
famous Isaac Kalloch became Mayor of
San Francisco.: . . â â 
Ever since then he has been either In
public office or busy seeking to obtain
onu. He has been an Assemblyman, a
Judge, a Congressman, and, in the Inter
vals Â«if his omce-holding career, has been
engaged in the precarious practice of his j
profession. He knows all about my in- !
comu, but I know nothing- more 0 his i
than that as an alleged public servant of '
one kind or another he has drawn from !
the public treasury a sum approximating
SGO.OOO. although pretending to be- a mem
ber of a party whose avowed principle is
â¢ that public salaries shall Â» correspond with !
the price of labor and its products. Dur- '
ing all his public career I have never I
heardjof his initiating any movement to
reduce his own salary, whether as As
semblyman, Judge or Congressman, and i
he is now in full cry after an office whose
compensation is SCOW a year.
He goes before the Populists claiming i
to be with them heart and soul, assuring i
them that he will faithfully and earnestly
devote himself to the accomplishment of
the purposes of the Popullsta as declared
in their National and State platform*. '
He declares that he is in favor of irre- I
deemable national money to be Issued '
by the general Government only as a
full â¢ legal tender for public nnd private
debts, which said irrodenv>able national !
money is to be fairly disbursed by the i
Government of the people.
What this lawful distribution may im
ply may perhaps be bettor understood by
rrinV; to an : earlier nlatform 'â¢ of the
national Populists , in which It % was de
manded that the Government should issue
to the people for tnelr use Irredeemable |
paper money without consideration, in an
amount eqnal to tho sum of $60 per capita
to every man. woman and child in the
United States.
Maguire ia In favor of the free coinage
of silver at tlio ratio of 18 to 1. without the
concurrence or aid of any foreign power,
though he knows that free and unlimited
coinage of silver at this ratio now simply
means that a quantity of silver bullion
may be taken to the mints of 1 the United
! States and that the owner thereof shajl
receive therefor as many United States
standard silver legal tender dollars as
can be coined from that bullion.
In other words, he intends that the
United States mint shall {five $12,929 in
United States standard silver legal tender
dollars in exchange for 10,000 ounces of
silver bullion worth only $6000 at the
standard of to-day. It means that a man
may exchange 1000 Mexican dollars
! worth to-day |460, for $1000 in money of
I the United States. The United States mint
shall give to the holder of the Mexican
dollars $1000 in United States standard
legal silver dollars, which under our pres
ent system arc worth that amount in
gold. He is in favor, as I say, of irre
deemable national money ta be issued in
such sums as shall largely increase. the
volume of the circulating medium.
It was as the apostles of this doctrine
that the Democrats, including Mr. Ma
! quire, attempted, in the Kifty-lifth Con- |
press, the substitution of an issue of $150,
000.000 in greenbacks in the place of bonds
foj that amount bearing 3 per cent inter
est, as proposed by the Republicans. It
was in pursuance of 'this same idea that
the Populists have demanded that there
shall be no further issue of United States
interest bearing bonds.
Mr. Maguire and those who are with
him in this insane proposition know per
fectly well that nowhere In the world is |
money loaned without compensation to
the lender, more or less reasonable ac
cording to circumstances, and that if non
interest bearing bonds could be put out
by the Government to run, say, twenty j
years, they could be said in the market i
only at such a discount as would make
thoir face at maturity equal to principal
and inter*--' at such a rale as other Inter
est-bearing bonds may bear.
Mr. Maguire. and those who were with
him in this scheme to issue $150,000,000 ir
redeemable greenbacks, knew penectly |
well that such an lsaue would be subject i
to a similar discount, and, indeed, to a p
very much greater depreciation. t The !
non-interest bearing bonds might be paid
at some fixed period. Irredeemable green
backs are never to be ransomed by tho
Government either in gold or silver, but j
are to be replaced as long, as the Gov- ,
ernment can get hold of paper and main
tain a printing press.
This country has had enough of such
crazy propositions. And it is fortunate j
for the nation and for its financial repu- I
tation at home and abroad that Mr. Ma
quire and his allies failed in their efforts i
to create the impression- that the issue of :
greenbacks was vastly preferable to an
issue of bonds, because the greenbacks ;
created a non-interest-bearing debt, j
while bonds would draw 3 per cent. It |
would #eem impossible to make them un- i
derstand the fallacy of the argument j
upon which this fragment of the Popu- ;
list's crazy-quilt is made.
Experience is said to be the only school
which will teach a fool, but even ex
perience has failed to be instructive to
a Maguire.
We have learned that paper, no matter
what is printed on it,*hat> no intrinsic
value, and that the |
worth of paper money
must depend upon the 'â 
power of the Govern
ment to keep It at par i
with the best money
of the world, which
was gold during tho :
civil war. and is gold
to-day. No one but
these, people fails to
Fluctuation
of the
Greenback.
remember that the legal tender notes of j
the United States from the time their ie- !
sue commenced in IS<>2 down to January,
1579, when specie payments were resumed,
underwent tremendous fluctuation which
injured commerce, made business difficult I
and dangerous find produced endless can- <
fusion in all the linancial relations of the
citizens of the I'nited States with each !
other. Nobody but a greenbacker will
fail to remember that In 1564 these notes
fell in value to 49.2â that is to say, that
every bushel of grain, and every ton of :
hay. that every article manufactured, that
all service and labor rendered, involved a \
sacrifice at that rate of 51 cents on every
dollar due.
From ISGS to 1869 greenbacks fluctuated
from 63 cents to 75 cents, in the year 1870 â
the year in which the Franco-Prussian
war broke outâ they rose to 87 cents, fell
again in 1873, rose to 89 in 1874. and
dropped again to 87 cents In 1.575. At this
time agitation began in favor of the re
sumption of specie payments, a Republi
can measure initiated and carried through
l:y the Republican party, and, under the
stimulus vt this hope, greenbacks as
sured of redemption after gradual yearly |
advancement went to par when specie
payments were resumed.
Does any man having property, or ex
pecting to have property, desire a re
newal of such conditions?
In fact, no sensible or reasonable per
son does, but Mr. Maguire, with his hair
full of fictitious hay seeds, and his ears ;
adorned with Imitation straw, goes
through the country standing upon a
platform and shouting for a condition
of things which he knows would be ab
solutely ruinous to the bent prospects of
the country. He is in favor of depriv
ing his fellow citizens of the right to
make contracts for the payment of money
in whatever coin the debtor and creditor
may select. He is in favor of having
the* Government borrow gold and repay
its debt in depreciated silver. He is in
favor of an Income tax as a meant* of
public revenue, although it has been de
cided by the Supreme Court of the I'nited
States that such a tax iÂ« unconstitutional.
He is In favor of the Government owner
ship of all railroads and telegraphs, and,
more than all, he is in favor of the Gov
ernment taking possession by some
method of all lands which are held by
the citizens of the United States In ex
cess of the actual present needs of the
owner thereof.
And here is where the single tax is ex
pected to play Its part. Of this fallacious,
dangerous and socialistic dogma Mr. Ma
guire has been an advocate to the utmost
of his ability.
Not later than November 6th. 1896. in a
communication .o the Examiner news
paper, he declared that the land question
was coming and was then near at hand,
and that the single tax idea had largely
and generally taken hold of the popular
heart. He declared that already the sin
gle taxers demanded that practical efforts
ne commenced Immediately to force the
issue into politics in California. He made
the following statement:
"The Legislature will be asked at its next
session to submit to the voters a constitu
tional amendment remitting the whole
question of taxation for State, county and
municipal purposes to the Legislature as
a first step toward the single tax. The
moment that amendment is submitted the
battle will be on in earnest."
And I here call your attention to
amendment No. 2, being Senate constitu
tional amendment No. 10, providing for
the framing of local county government
acts by inhabitants of counties for their
government, and providing that each
county and municipality may determine
the method and mode of taxation for
county and municipal purposes.
This proposed amendment to the con
stitution Is now before the people, and,
with Mr. Maifuire as Governor of the
State of California, this single tax bat
tle will Indeed be on In earnest. In this
same communication he declares that
every human being has a natural rela
tion to the land, the common heritage
of all mankind, from the immediate gift
of the Creator, which no common law
can or ever could rightfully cut off by
any form or system or land tenure!'
. He denies that the ownership of land
has ever added the value of a farthing to
the world's wealth, or a joy to the user's
siock of happiness; that, it is a sonHd and
extortionate system which compels the
masses of God's children to pay tribute to
a few for the privilege of inhabiting
God's earth. And Â».e allowed that this
only scientific and effective remedy fpr
what he calls land monopoly was ulÂ« sin
gle tax.
This single tax dogma is commonly
undersiood to mean that the burden of
taxation for national, State and county
and municipal purposes shall fall upon
the land alone; that personal property of
all kind, stocks, bonds, money, buildings
of all kindH in cities and In the country,
shall go free of taxation; that the great
railway corporations shall he taxed only
upon their right-of-way, leaving fran
chises.' depots, shops, machinery and roll
ing stock free of any charge or burden
Whatever which may aid to support the j
cost of government.
It would naturally s.-em that a dogma
so absurd as this would furnish its own
answer. And no it aoes from every eco
nomic point of view. The real object of
the single tax Is not to place the burden
of taxation where It properly belongs
upon all property of all kinds 'and wher
ever, situated, but to so burden land that
its owner cannot afford to hold any more
than is absolutely necessary for his im
mediate personal needs while living and
for his prrave when dead, and thnt the
balance of his present holdings shall go j
Into the public treasury whence the
usufruct of the land shall be given out
to the people according to the Govern
ment's comprehension of the necessities
of the people. If this Is not socialism

mer recreation or the grave in which he
shall ultimately rest. It Is a principle
which prevents Investments, retards de- (
velopment and brings about at last that
confusion In property and destruction of
values which is the glory of anarchism,
and would be the pride of that IJemocracy
of Euro))Â© tt> which Mr. Magutre so
proudly alluded In his speech In Congress
on the 27th of January, 1*97. in which
he declared that the exclusion of
anarchists, socialists and nihilists frpm
the United States was not desirable, and
that they were generally educated men,
many of them holding university degrees,
whose offense consisted of resistance to
tyranny, which in the conditions under
which they lived was obedience to God.
Who are the nihilists? "They are the
Democrats of Russia who are struggling
against almost hopeless conditions to es
tablish the natural and inalienable rights-;
of man in that country as against the
tyranny and false pretense of divine right
on the part of the Czar."
If James G. Maguire had uttered no I
other sentiment destructive of the rights I
of property and the public tranquillty .
than these* he would be unfit to hold the;
office of Governor, or any other office in ;
the gift of the people of the State of Call- |
fornia. He Insolently asks: "Who are the
nihilists?" I will answer.
They are the men who murdered the
Emperor of Russia, the men who mur
dered Carnot, the President of the French
Republic; they are the men who threw
from the gallery into the pit of a Bar
ct-lona theater a dynamite bomb which
destroyed 1 know not how many inno
cent human lives; they are the men who i
cast the dynamite bombs into the crowded i
Haymarket Square of Chicago; they are j
the men ot whom one stabbed In the i
back an aged woman sojourning in Swlt- i
zerland. a human being whose life had I
been full of charity and good works, who
loved her people and who was loved by
themâ simply and only because she was i
the wife of Francis Joseph of Austria.
These Wretches, no one of whom as far
as has been detected was a gentleman
holding a university degree, were mainly
criminals under the ban of Justice and ;
set king by murder to reduce all mankind
and all property to one common level of j
misery and horror. There is not a den i
of these scoundrels existing to-day in ;
TEurope in which James G. Maguire would j
not be an honored guest and to which he I
would not be elected, upon the reading of
this certificate, to honorary membership. ,
There Is not an anarchist or nihilist In
Europe who, seeking refuge from merit- i
ed justice and searching for some quar
ter of the globe where he would be im- !
mune, on reading this declaration of
James G. Maguire, if Maguire were after
ward Governor of California, would not j
turn his face hitherward and come to him i
sure of protection and immunity, no j
matter what crime he might commit in \
the nume of nihilism against good order,
law, government and properi--
Elect Maguire Governor and you place
him at the head of the list of villainous j
demagogues who have disgraced public j
office in the United States, and In the j
front ranks of which have hitherto :
marched Waite, Pennoyer, Weaver, Alt- :
geld, Leedy, Tillman and Debs.
California wants no Governor who is
crazy or foolish enough to avow sym
pathy for this dastardly and cowardly
Class of criminals. It will elect no man j
Governor of the State who would have
it in his power to pardon the cowardly
class of crimes of such assassins and
make the golden State at least
during his term of office a- safe harbor
of refuge for them. It will have for Gov
ernor no man to whom the club of Denis
Kearney has descended as a scepter
of right, and who will make California
as hot for people who have money to In
vest or who have money to keep as <
Kearney ever sought to make it.
The inauguration of such a Governor,
the whirling maze of sand-lottf-rs, single
taxers. Populists, Coxeyites and social
ists, bellowing for all sorts of financial
and social heresies would terrify every
man necking investment in this Slate and
drive every one otherwise seeking to Im
prove and develop Its resources to some '
portion of our blessed land where Ma- i
euire and Magufreism are happily un- j
known.
The peroration was beautiful and im- '
pressive. Men and women of the vast
assemblage as they wended their way
to their homes talked of General
Barnes' great speech and predicted a
great Republican triumph. To-mor- j
row night Gage and Barnes will ad- !

SIR ARTHUR CURTIS
COMMITTED SUICIDE
Story Told by a Member of His Party
Just Back From the Ash
croft Trail.
VANCOUVER, Sept. 26.â Sir Arthur
Curtis, the English Baronet who disap
peared mysteriously from the Ashcroft
trail last spring, undoubtedly committed
suicide. This is the statement made by
Ambrose Atwood, a member of the un
fortunate nobleman's ill-starred expedi
tion to the Klondike. Atwood reached
here from Port Simpson on the steamship
Horsa, after encountering untold suffer
ings on' the trail. His story differs
in many respects from that told by
Roger Pocock several months ago.
Atwood says that after Quenselle was
passed the party quarreled frequently.
\ Disaster after disaster followed them,
their horses being lost and their outfits
ruined by rain. The quarrels drove Sir
Arthur to distraction, and daily he be
came more despondent.
At Mad River, which borders a dense,
trackless forest, which runs hundreds of
miles to the barren lands of the great
northwest, final disaster overtook the
party, and they quarreled more fiercely
than ever. One morning after the horses
had strayed into the wood and while sev
eral in camp were engaged in an alterca
tion. Sir Arthur, looKing like a mad
man, rushed out of his tent, crying:
"For God's Bake, men, don't act like
I children."
He then got Into a quarrel with a
brother Englishman and they almost
came to blows.
"I'll end it all," he was heard to say,
but no one paid any attention to the re
mark.
After a while he calmed down, and,
lighting his pipe, said he would look for
the horses. He walked into the forest,
| and was never seen again.
"We all think now." said Atwood, "that
he carried out his threat and threw him
self into one of the dark, sluggish streams
that run through the forest. I believe the
! Indians who have been searching for his
; body know where it ip. but will not give
It up until the reward is larger. At the
present time $1000 is offered, and they
want $5000. Before I left word was received
that Sir Arthur's Kuulish relatives were
on the way out and would continue the
[ search."
i Atwood is an educated Boston man and
I tells his story simply and with a convinc
! ing air.

â¢ f"I ' ramento.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 26.â Jockey Podro
Enos earned for himself an enforced va
cation in the second race at the park to
day. Pedro had the leg up on San Au- :
gustUie, which was bncked from 5 down i
to S, and the officials thought the rider
altogether too retiring In his efforts to :
beat out the l-to-2 favorite, Napian, with
Thorpe up. Possibly Enos became afflict
ed with stage fright, or perhaps was i
soiwd by a strange feeling of ennui. San
Augustine, apparently not all out, was
beaten a lenyth, and Enos was suspended.
The rainfall of last night left a sticky,
clayey course to run over, which was re- j
sponsible for one or two upsets, the most i
startling being the defeat of the top- !
heavy choice Red Glenn by Ringmaster, a
12-to-l shot. l-ady Hrttajinic, Napian and
Toribio, favorites, and Dolore, a second
Choice, wire the other purse winners.
In the opening live furlong scramble
Lady Britannic displayed as strong a
fondness f"r the splashy going as a hobo
does for an empty oyster can, and won
ail. by herself. The black mare from St.
Louis was a 3-to-5 chance, and was well
ridden by Gouin. Dolly D. a Red Iron
mare, took the place from Mollie A, an
other daughter ,of the Woodland sire.
Smyle, from the stable of Hughey Jones,
was strongly played "to peep," but after
showing speed for a quarter finished in
last place.
It looks very much as if Orville Appleby
has 'another Conde in Ringmaster, for the
chestnut horse shows to better advantage
at each new start. The third event, at a
mile and seventy yards, was looked on as
an "airtight" for Red Glenn, with Thorpe
to do the navigating, and there was very
little speculating on the others. The lat
ter was .never able to extend Ringmaster,
with I'.ullnian in the points, which made
the pace from the start and won easily
by a couple of lengths.
Magnus was a. di3tant . third, eight
lengths behind the favorite. Old Leon
villc, patched up for the occasion, was a
starter, but broke down soon after the
Btart.
The good riding of Gouin landed the
fourth purse for Dolore. The mare en-
Joyed second call in the betting. Thorpe's
mount. Torsion, ruling an even money
choice. The latter started off with a
rare showing of speed, but in the stretch
began hoisting distress signals.
Gouin oi# Dolore saved two lengths by
a short- turn Into the Ptretrh. and in a
driving finish got the decision from Pat
Murphy by a neck, stepping the six fur
longs in iris. Twelve to one was offered
about Pat, as his recent performances
were a' bit stagnant. In the damp foot
ing to-day, though, he was ready money.
Mister Holmes late of Montana, tied
the knot back .of the ears of Amasa in
the final flve-furlong jaunt and the odds
agair.st the fast " gelding dropped from'
six to live to threes. Holmes, in his
happy,, contented way. put up a repose
fuf,rl(lÂ«-outin-front-aTifl at the wire was ;
dqwnod a length by Toriblo, played down
from three to even money. Several
breakaways at the post militated against
the chances of Fig Leaf, for she was un
able to get to the front and was fortunate
to take the show from Roadwarmer.

BROOKS INQUEST
ENDS IN NAUGHT
Coroner's Jury Accuses
No One.
NELSON STILL A PRISONER
SHERIFF HARRISON BELIEVES
HIM GUILTY.
Deputy Marshal Cramer's Testimony
Wholly Contradictory of the
Stary Related by the
Deckhand.
Special Dispatch to The Can.
SAN RAFAEL, Sept. 26.â Despite the
decision of the Coroner's jury that the
facts were not of sufficient force to
warrant it in charging Peter Nelson,
the deckhand on the yacht Chispa, with
the murder of Captain James Moss
Brooks, Sheriff Harrison is so thorough
ly convinced of the guilt of the pris
oner that he has not yet discharged
him from custody and pending a more
careful investigation will hold the
deckhand at the County Jail. Coroner
Eden conducted the inquest and did all
in his power to bring out the facts.
The first important testimony was
given by Deputy Marshal Susavilla,
William Harrison's private watchman.
He said none of the party had seen a
boat leave the Chispa. However, as
the night was dark and the wind blow
ing strongly he inclined to the belief
that even if a boat had left nobody
would have known it.
Alfred Nilson, the keeper of the yacht
Ramona, supplied the additional
knowledge tha 1 : at the time he pulled
Nelson into the boat the deckhand had
on one sock, but the foot of his unin
jured leg was bare. George Smith, one
of the first to board the yacht, asserted
that as the rowboat approached the
scene somebody on a yacht near by
yelled to them to be careful, that a
crazy man on the Chispa was shooting
at everybody.
Nelson was sworn. He told the jury
his story in just about the same words
as it was formerly related to the Sher
iff. He stated that the door leading
from the cabin to the forecastle, where
he slept, was closed at the time the
murder was committed and that he had
to reach the deck by climbing through
the hatchway. Nelson's wounded leg
was shown to Dr. Jones, the autopsy
physician, who testified afterward that
the wound could have been caused by
either a bullet or a scrape rrom some
suitable instrument.
Dr. Jones testified that he had found
five distinct wounds of the scalp, an
abrasion of th" left ear and abrasions
on the fingers of the right hand and
left wrist of Captain Brooks. The
worst wound was behind the left ear
and the one on the left temple was
also deep. They could have been pro
duced with some instrument like a mar
lin spike or a hatchet.
By far the most important evidence
adduced was from Deputy Marshal Eu
gene Cramer. He said that when he
entered the room in which the captain
lay dead he picked up the arm lying
above the cover and found it cold and
stiff. The elbow could hardly be
flexed at all. The bedclothes were not
disturbed, showing that the captain
had made no struggle. Cramer said
that one of the most peculiar facts in
connection with the murder was that
while the body lay on the right side,
the large wound in the back of the
head from which the blood had spurted
being toward the back of the couch,
the opposite wall of the room was cov
ered from the bood that had spurted
on it. Cramer said this could not
have been possible if the body lay as it
was found. In his opinion, Captain
Brooks had been dead at least an hour
and was killed while standing near the
opposite wall. The body must then
have been placed In the bed and cov
ered with the clothes.
Marshal Hannon was recalled to the
stand and gave substantially the same
testimony as his predecessors. He said
Cramer had not only felt of Captain
Brooke' pulse and remarked that the
arm was icy cold, but had placed his
hand under the dead man's nightshirt
and over his heart, only to exclaim:
"Why, his body is so cold that I can
feel it through the undershirt."
When William Harrison's name was
called he was missing. District At
torney Martinelli said he guessed Har
rison's testimony would not differ
much from what had already been
learned.
Had Harrison been summoned he
would have sworn that he stood on the
shore and saw the flashes of the re
volver; that they were toward the
stern of the boat and not toward the
starboard side and in the direction in
which the prisoner swam, according to
his assertion. Harrison also would
have testified that the splash of Nel
son's plunge into the water did not oc
cur until after all three shots had been
fired.
No attempt was made to have Mrs.
Case or Mrs. Crandal present, though
both of these ladies were ii- a position
to hear everything and have already
stated that they heard the sound of
the splash a few moments after the
shots. Dr. Case was present and said
no subpena had been served on his
wife, and that she had told him the re
ports preceded the splash.
It was shortly after the noon hour
when all the evidence was in and the
Jury did not hesitate long before bring
ing in a verdict that Captain Brooks
had come to his death early in the
morning of the 24th inst. by wounds
inflicted with a blunt instrument In the
hands of a party or of parties un
known.
HOBSON CONFIDENT HE
CAN RAISE THE COLON
Expects to Return to New York on
Her â How the Maria Teresa
Was Floated.
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Sept. 26.âDe
tails just received of the floating of the
Spanish armored cruiser. Maria Teresa
show that with the help of dynamite she
was blown off the rocks into deep water
on September 23, and proceeded under her
own steam some time afterward to Guan
tanamo, accompanied by one of the tugs
of the Merritt Wrecking Company. She
will shortly leave for New York.
Naval Constructor Hobson says he can
raise the Spanish cruiser Cristobal Colon,
with the use of air bags, in a week. If
given authority to do so. Commodore
Watson thinks he cannot. The Colon, it
appears, was not seriously damaged by
shells, but her valves were opened, which
caused her to sink. The other two Span
ish cruisers sunk in the battle of Santi
ago, the Almirante Oquendo and the Viz
caya, are useless wrecks .of melted iron.
Hobson says he expects to return to
New York on the Colon.

The Democratic Municipal Conven
tion met again last evening and rati
fied another flection of the slate ticket
prepared by Mayor Phelan. "Whisper
ing" Gavin McNab and the sel_f-aD
pointed keepers of the honor of the
party in San Francisco.
The result of the evening's work
showed that dangers that had so seri
ously threatened the Integrity of the
slate on Friday evening as to necessi
tate a hasty adjournment had either
been overcome or rendered harmless by
offensive and defensive alliances with
the discordant elements. Franklin K.
Lane, secure in the possession of the
personal promises of a majority of the
members of the convention, had forced
the programmers to rub the name of
William T. Baggett off the slate and
place his own there opposite the office
of City and County Attorney. Eugene
X. Deuprey had been whipped out of
the race for District Attorney by the
Examiner and Mayor Phelan, and the
place that his name had occupied on
the slate was filled with the name of
Barclay Henley.
In the matter of the nomination of
a candidate for Recorder Thomas Pin
der still holds the winning hand In
spite of all the efforts that have been
made to bring about his defeat. The
same people w.ho caused Deuprey to
withdraw have so far failed to friehten
Plnder. This being the case there was
nothing else to do but to postpone mak
ing the nomination bo that the con
spirators may have more time in which
to break his hold on the convention.
Incidental to the proceedings of the
convention there was a continued dem
onstration by the gallery that at. times
threatened to make an adjournment
necessary. IMany of the members of the
convention were hooted for minutes at
a time, and It was with the utmost diffi
culty that the cut and dried proceed
ings were carried on.
After the convention had been called
to order by Chairman McGee a motion
was made authorizing the appointment
by the chair of a committee of five to
fill any vacancies that may occur in
the ticket after the work of the con
vention is completed, The chair asked
for and was granted time in which to
name the members of the committee.
An amendment to the platform was
adopted pledging all candidates to pa
tronize the Allied Trades Union Label.
The chairman announced that nomi
nations for Treasurer were In order and
Emil Pohll placed M. Greenblatt In
nomination. Clltus Barbour seconded
the nomination and there being no
further names presented Mr. Green
blatt was by a unanimous vote de
clared to be the nominee of the con
vention.
The next nomination In order was
that of Tax Collector. Howard Q.
Thompson placed James M. Block in
nomination. There being no opposing
candidate for the place he waa placed
on the ticket by acclamation.
According to the regular order of
business the nomination of a candidate
for Recorder should have come next,
but for reasons already outlined it was
necessary to skip this, so Max Popper
moved that the selection of a candidate
for this office be postponed until the
next session of the convention. Car
ried.
P. H. McCarthy placed John A.
Brown in nomination for the office of
County Clerk and Sidney Van Wyck

presented the name of M. C. Haley,
Both Brown and Haley had plenty of
"rooters" In the lobby, though it was
generally known to all that Brown's
name wae on the slate and that the
programmers would nominate him in
spite of any demonstration that might
be made in favor of his opponent. This
proved to be the case and the vote as
announced stood 53 for Brown and SS
for Haley.
When nominations for City and
County Attorney were called for "W. B.
Cope presented the name of Franklin
K. Lane. Thoee who had anticipated a
contest for this nomination were dis
appointed when E. A. Bridgford took
the floor and announced that the name
of William T. Baggett would not be
presented- He then thanked those mem
bers of the convention who had been
friendly to Baggett's candidacy and
concluded by reading a letter from Bag
gett in which that gentleman an
nounced his withdrawal from the fight.
The secretary was then instructed to
cast the ballot of the convention for
Mr. Lane.
When the chairman announced that
nominations for the office of District
Attorney were in order there were loud
calls of "Barrett," and for a few min
utes the lobby and gallery were in an
uproar. The cheers and shouts were
repeated when A. Comte placed John J.
Barrett'B name before the convention.
Joseph N. Nougues nominated Barclay
Henley, the slate candidate. The men
tion of Henley's name was greeted with
gToans and hoots from the crowd In
the rear. At this point W. B. Bullivan
addressed the chair and asked unani
mous consent for Eugene Deuprey to
address the convention. An amend
ment, which was accepted, was offered
to the effect that both candidates for
the nomination be also allowed to ad
dress the convention.
As Deuprey took his place on the
platform the lobby cheered again and
again for Barrett and it was Â«3veral
minutes before the speaker could gain
an audience. He said:
"I desire to express my gratitude for
the compliment that has been extended
to mo by allowing me an >.rpportun!ty
to explain the position in which I stand
here to-night My individual efforts
hÃ.vÂ« always been directed toward Ihe

time have I ever asked anything at the
hands of my party, and I do not ask
it now. During the past fe^ days I
have gone over my business aiTairs, and
I find that my business and my obliga
tions to my clients will not permit me
to devote the time that should be de
voted to the conduct of a personal cam
paign. I must therefore decline the
honor of asking you for your suffrage
and the suffrage of the good people of
the city. There are others who may
be found who will serve you as well and
perhaps better than I. I know that the
nomination could be mine for the ask
ing, but I am forced by circumstances
to decline."
When Barrett took his place on the
platform he was cheered In a manner
sufficiently hearty to Insure him that
the lobby was with him even If his
name was not on the slate. He said:
"Since the first moment that I as
pired to the office of District Attorney
I never hesitated in the judgment that
by right of fitness and long service the
office belonged to Mr. Deuprey."
Mr. Barrett continued by saying that
he had urged his own candidacy, be
lieving that Deuprey would not accept
the nomination even were it offered to
him. He also defended himself on the
charge of being a young man and call
ed attention to the comparative youth
of Bryan, Budd and Phelan. Barclay
Henley did not appear before the con
vention.
During the roll can the crowded lobby
kept up a constant demonstration in
favor of Barrett, and every member
who vott*d for him came in for an ova
tion. Those members who voted tor
Henley were hooted and hissed and for
a time it appeared as though business
would have to be suspended. Charles
W. Fay and Max Popper came in for
the greatest number of hissep and
hoots. The roll call was finally com
pleted and the vote as announced
stood: Barrett 37, Henley 55. Henley
was declared the. nominee of the con
vention.
Jasper McDonald nominated James
Denman for Superintendent of Schools.
There being no other candidates Mr.
Denman's nomination was made unan
imous.
Charles Gallagher (not of the clan)
placed R. P. Doolan in nominate- for
Superintendent of Streets. His was the
only name presented and the nomina
tion was made by acclamation.
The committees having in charge the
making of the Supervisorial and Board
of Education slates were not ready to
report. As the programmers have not
yet agreed upon the names to bo placed
on the balance of the ticket an adjourn
ment waa taken until Wednesday even

will be held in Odd Fellows' HalL

THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 1898.
MAGUIRE SPEAKS
AT LOS ANGELES
Begins by Referring to
His Blacksmith Days.
HE CRITICIZES REPUBUCANS
DEFENDS HIS ACTIONS WHILE
IN CONGRESS.
And Concludes by Denying That He
Had Ever Been Connected With
the San Francisco
Sand Lot.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 26.â James G.
Maguire addressed a large audience
last night at Hazard's Pavilion. J. L.
Murphy, the chairman of the meeting,
and the fusion candidate for District
Attorney, introduced Mr. Maguire as a
man who could go from one end of the
State to the other and discuss the Is
sues of the day without getting any
body else to make his speeches.
Referring to his blacksmith days. Mr.
Maguire said that while an apprentice
he had become imbued with a sym
pathy for his fellow men. The speaker
said that there had been several key
notes to the Republican campaign. The
first keynote was given by Mr. Gage.
The second by General Barnes, the
third keynote by Estee. If it were a
settled fact that the Republican cam
paign had to be led by an attorney of
the Southern Pacific, the managers had
done well, for General Barnes was the
most aloquent of the Southern Pacific's
attorneys. Mr. Maguire then read Es
tee's speech as published by The Call.
Barnes had said that the railroad was
a dead iÃsue, but Estee evidently did
not think so. Estee had said, "You
cannot serve the Lord and please the
devil at the same time," but this was
evidently what Estee was trying to do.
Mr. Maguire denounced the attempt
to cloud domestic issues by dragging
the war into the campaign.
"The glories of the war," he said,
"constitute our common heritage, but
the conduct of the war was not all
glory. As the scandal remains the com
mon sorrow of the whole people, so
should the glory of the war be shared
by the whole people."
"My honorable opponent," said Mr.
Maguire, "has misrepresented my ac
tion in Congress on the funding bill. My
opponent says 'If Judge Maguire had
said to the chairman that he objected
to the passage of the bill, it could
never have been passed.' The funding
measure came back from the Senate to
the House aa part of the general de
ficiency bill. This bill Included twenty
two million dollars in appropriations
for the army and navy. If, as Mr. Gage
says, my objection to this bill could
have stopped its passage, then the war
with Spain could have been stODDed
by my vote. As a matter of fact, one
hundred objections could have been dis
posed of in twenty minutes."
Mr. Maguire concluded by denying
that he had ever been connected with
the sand lot. He said he had always
been for law and order and was a lieu
tenant In the State militia, when Gen
eral Barnes was stirring up the peoole
with incendiary speeches against the
proprietors of The Call and Bulletin.

NEW YORK, Sept. 26.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Colonel Wil
liam Jennings Bryan is quite ill with ma
larial fever at his boarding house in this
city. He has been compelled to take to
his bed and Is undergoing medical treat
ment. While it is not believed his condition
is serious, his physician has directed that
he observe the greatest precaution, to
prevent the disease from developing into
typhoid fever.

Special Dispatch to The CftU.
MANILA, Sept. 26.â When the United
States auxiliary cruiser McCulloch cap
tured the insurgent steamer Abbey,
formerly the Pasig, sixty miles south of
Manila, the Abbey, it is believec, hav
ing landed 7000 rides, an insurgent boat
followed the America vessel Into Ca-
vlte, an-l now the Americans contem
plate taking possession of the entire
Insurgent fleet because the vessels are
flying an unrecognized flag and are
liable to se.zure as pirates by the war
vessels of any nation. American cruis
ers have gone north to where the
steamer Flllplnas Is landing troops.
â¢The steamers which have just arrived
brought many Spanish officials and
refugees from the southeast of the
Island of Luzon. They report that the
Insurgents are overrunning the coun
try, destroying property and the hemp
crops.
Sanguinary conflicts have taken place
at Cebu and Hollo. There has been an
outbreak of ~mallpox in the California
regiment here, but only ob: cases of a
mild type '- ye been reported.
GERMAN PROPOSAL
MADE TO AGUINALDO
CHICAGO, Sept. 26.â The Tribune's
staff correspondent on board the over
land limited telegraphs from Carroll,
lowa, that Felipe Agoncello, the first
accredited emissary of Aguinaldo'a
revolutionary government to any for
eign power, with his secretary and In
terpreter, will, upon reaching Chicago,
proceed to Washington over the Penn
sylvania line to lay before President
McKinley the appeal of the Filipinos
for representation on the peace com
mission at Paris.
If official representation on the com
mission cannot be granted he will urge
that the administration at Washington,
in justice to the people of the Philip
pines, should secure for him the right
to be heard by the commission, in order
that any unjurt charges or false accu
sations against the Filipinos which the
Spanish members of the commission
may set forth shall not go unanswered.
In his statement Agoncello says:
As to the power of the Flllnino Govern
ment to control the islands and maintain
order, provided the Spanish forces are
withdrawn, I have no misgivings. There
are 30,000 armed men in Its army. Borne
of its arms came from captured Span
iards and some from foreign countries.
I am not at liberty to say where.
No, they did not come from Germany,
and the statements that have been made
that the Filipinos are secretly conniving
with the Germans are false and unjust.
It Is true that a few days after the de
struction of the Spanish fleet in Manila
Bay representatives of the German em
pire made proposals to the insurgents to
aid them in forming an independent gov
ernment. This offer was refused, the re
ply made to the Germans being that, un
der an agreement entered into between
Aguinaldo and Admiral Dewey, the insur
gents were in honor bound to refuse the
offer.

Special cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted. 1898. by James Gor
don Bennett.
HONGKONG. Sept. 26.â The report
reaches here that the Spanish gunboats
General Alava and El Cano have de
stroyed the Filipino steamer Balusan
off the island of Masbate, between Ma

the wrecks of the Reina Christina, Cas
tilla, Don Antonio de Ulloa, Isla de
Mindanao, Ve.osco, Argos, Marquaes
del Duero and General Lozo, which
were sunk by Admiral Dewey's shipÃ.
This course wag resolved upon after a
consultation with Hongkong experts,
who advised against any attempt at
salvage. An effort will be made to save
the other vessels.
REPORT OF OTIS ON
CONDITION OF TROOPS
WASHINGTON, Sept. 28*-Th* War
Departmen' has received a dispatch
from Major General Otis, at Manila,
reporting the condition of the troops in
the Philippines. He says that the
health of the men generally is good and
that the percentage of sickness is
small. Following is General Otis' cable
gram in full:
MANILA, Sept. 26.-AdJutant General,
waenington: I understand that reporters
aent exaggerated accounts of the sick
ness here. The total number in hospitals
to-day, the highest of any day. Is 529; ty
phoid patients, 95. All are doing well, and
most or the patients are convalescent.
About 1200 are excused from duty, mostly
for Blight ailments, showing the condition
to be fair for this latitude. Nineteen
deaths from disease this month, twenty
three In August
OTIS, Commanding.
AMPHION ENCOUNTERS
AN AWFUL STORM
Badly Battered by the Waves in Ber
ing Sea, but Manages to
Beach Victoria.
VICTORIA, B. C, Sept. 28.â Very
much battered up and looking nothing
like the trim vessel known to Esqul
malt H. M. S. Amphion arrived this
morning from the Bering Sea. She ex
perienced a terrific hurricane, which
blew with typhoon fierceness Wednes
day and Thursday last, during which
huge waves swept over the big war
ship. The cabins were flooded and the
waves rushed in fury along the pass
age way. On the decks everything
swam; guns rolled about and every
thing not securely fastened was torn
away. Most of the boats were washed
free and their appurtenances lost. The
boats themselves were afterward
picked up.
"It was, indeed, an awful storm,"
Captain Finnis said, "and had not
things been battened down much more
damage would have been done. Of the
Bealing vessels which were on their
way home nine of them left some time
before the Amphion or they would un
doubtedly have been caught in the
storm, which resembled 'the dreadful
typhoons of the China Seas. As it is,
feara are entertained that some of
them have met with disaster."
ALARMING SICK LIST
OF ERNST'S BRIGADE
Forty-Two Per Cent Disabledâ Our
Troops Hold Four-Fifths of
Porto Rico.
PONCE, Porto Rico, Sept. 26.â The
Americans now hold four-fifths of the
island. The Spanish are retiring upon
San Juan from all directions and the
American troops are moving up. Some
Blight disturbances have occurred at Bar
ros and Fajardo, but their Beriousness
has been exaggerated.
Captain Hammel'a company of the
Third Wisconsin Regiment entered Cayey
yesterday. General Ernst has moved his
headquarters to Aiboneto, but It is doubt
ful if his brigade will follow. The per
centage of sick in his brigade is forty
two and there are on the sick list in tne
entire command 2600, 400 of whom are suf
fering from typhoid fever.
The transport Obdam will sail to-mor
row with 240 convalescents and the Relief
will leave Arroyo wltn 260. The medical
officers generally believe the troops
should be sent north, but a few think
their condition will improve when they
crosa the mountains and get into quar
ters.
COLOMBIA REPUDIATES
THE CERRUTI CLAIM
Unless Italy Agrees to Resubmit the
Case She Will Oppose Force
With Force.
KINGSTON, Jamaica, Sept. 28.â Advices
from Cartagena, Colombia, state that the
Colombian Government has finally decid
ed to decline to pay the Cerruti claim, on
the ground that the republic is now able
to produce ample evidence of Cerruti's
complicity In the political troubles that
occurred In the country in 1576 and 1885.
The Government, according to the ad
vices received, has directed the President
to urgfe Italy to agree to resubmit the
case to arbitration, and in the event of
falling in this will attempt to oppose
foreÂ« with force to the last extreme.

who will head the local ticket. 1. W.
Truman and General "\V. H. H. Hart, ex-
Attorney General, are In the race and
have many friends working for them. Ihe
of Charles L. Patton are not
i any ground, but admit that ihey
have a hard battle on hand. Tne name
Of B. J. Baidwln has also been mentioned
in connection with the tight.
There will be a lively, contest before
the Shrievalty nomination is decided, i
Henry Martin, who was at first an- j
nounced as an aspirant for the Treas- i
urership, is making things interestng lor !
School Director. Head and ex-County
Clerk Blattner, who have been In the ;
tield fur several weeks. Head has a j
host vi friends in his battle and the I
Bame can be said of Blattner. The an- ]
nouncement made Saturday that Martin
was also antered Cor the place has caused
considerable uneasiness among the chain- ;
of the other two candidates.
\\ llliam Deane, at present a deputy un

Cornier Deputy County Clerk, are making
v Be tight for the County Clerkship.
I he light for Street Superintendent has '

A "dark horse" is aiso looked for in the !

a deputy in Judge Wallace's court, en- I
the iist.s yesterday luid with eight;

John D. Siebe and Supervisor John
Lackmann are out for the Assessorshlp.
Lackmann wu.s mentioned as a candidate
for the Board of Equalization at the I
State convention, but his friends advised ;

that he has a winning chance. The
friends of Siebe are equally sanguine.
Police Judges Joachimsen and Low !
would like to succeed themselves. Prose

TRE POPULISTS
FfSHTING FOR
A PARTY NAME
â Lively Row Before the
Supreme Court.
BOTH SIDES ARE READY
FACTS OF THE CONTROVERSY
ARE ADMITTED.
The Fusion Contestants Ask. That
Secretary of State Brown Be
Compelled to Recognize
. Them.
The fight for the Populist party desig
nation on the State ticket will be heard
this afternoon by the Supreme Court sit
ting in bank. The case was set for hear
ing yesterday, but as counsel had not
agreed on a statement of facts, a continu
ance was necessitated.
The proceedings will come up in the
form of a mandamus suit begun by Ed
ward I. Hutchison, the fusion candidate
for Lieutenant Governor, to compel Sec
retary of State Brown to recognize the
wing of the Populist party that nominated
James G. Maguire for Governor.
It will be remembered that there was a
bolt in the Populist convention at Sacra
mento when Maguire was nominated.
The "middle-of-the-road" Populists, who
were opposed to Maguire and fusion,
withdrew and organized another conven
tion. The "middle-of-the-road men" nom
inated a straight Populist ticket, with T.
W. H. Shanahan of Shasta as their stand
ard bearer. When the convention ad
journed both factions filed their tickets
with Secretary Brown, who after con
siderable deliberation decided that the
ticket headed by Shanahan was entitled
to the Populist designation. Thereupon
Hutchison instituted the mandamus pro
ceedings against Brown in the Supreme
Court.
When the case was called yesterday af
ternoon. T. V. Cator appeared for th"
"middle-of-the-roadsters," while Senator
White, Garret McEnerney, and Judge
Van Meter appeared for the fusion Popu
lists. Senator White said that there ex
isted some points of difference concern-
Ing the deductions to be drawn from the
pleadings. He stated that he and his col
leagues had worked on the matter all
Sunday and were not yet through with
their labors.
"I think,' 1 said he, "that if the hearing !
Is continued until to-morrow afternoon
we can meet with Mr. Cator ami agree
Upon a statement of facts. Then both :
sidt-s will be ready to proceed with the
argument of the law points involved."
Cator announced that he would confer I
with the other side, and the hearing was I
accordingly postponed.
The attorneys then withdrew, and after
three hours' consultation arrived at an
agreed statement of the facts. The dif
ferences were but slight. The only ob
jections found were to some of the de
ductions made by Cator in his answer
filed on behalf of Brown. The stipulation
will be typewritten and signed by all of
the counsel this morning, and in the af-

SOLLY SMITH LOSES
THROUGH A MISHAP
NEW YORK. Sept. 26.â Dave Sullivan
of Ireland and Solly Smith of I,os An
geles, featherweights, mot to-night at the
Greater New York Athletic Club for a
tweuty-flve round bout, but Smith was
Incapacitated early in the fight. The bout
was stopped at the end of the fifth round
by the referee, who awarded the honors
to Sullivan.
During the second round Smith had the
misfortune to break his left arm near the
wrlfit. He used It lightly a few times In
the third round, and it hung loosely in the
next two rounds, and it was seen by
everybody that the Callfornian could not
continue. Smith's accident robbed him of
what certainly would have been a vic
tory, as it was apparent, to every one that
he was by far the cleverer.
Sulllvan f s brother. "Spike," bet a lot of
money on his brother's ability to best the
Western man, forcing his price to 100 to 75
and he won a big pile on the result.

THE SAX FEANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 1898.
WAR BREAKS
OUT AMONG
THE FUSIONISTS
Smarting Under the
Humiliation.
EVERY FACTION IS MAD
FITZGERALD WAS BEATEN IN
THE CONVENTION.
Never Was tne Prospect for the Re
publican Ticket so Bright
as at Present.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 26.
The Silver Republicans are mad. The
Populists are madder and the Democrats
are the maddest of all. And all their an
ger is directed at the humiliating condi
tions which prevailed at Saturday's con
vention. Judging from the expressions of
the fusionists to-day, the Republican
tirket should go through In November
without let or hindrance. The Demo
cratic portion of the ticket is objection
able to the Populists, the Populists' tail
is objectionable to the Democratic dog
which refuses to be wagged by it, and
the Silver Republicans, with the excep
tion of those on the inside, are wondering
why they were brought into prominence
at all.
In the Democracy the old fight has
broken out with more vigor than ever.
The Fitzgerald and Laymance factions
â¢went Into the convention feeling bitter
toward each other and came out feeling
ni<.re bitter. The favorite of the Fitzger
ald wing was McLeod for Sheriff and the
neaa of the vote by which he was
defeated by the Laymance candidate,
ljandregan, shows how thoroughly the
party Is disrupted.
Now all are quarreling. The Engllsh-
Laymance faction declare that they
were jobbed by the Fitzgerald people in
i he matter of conceding the nomination
of Assessor to the Silver Republicans.
They openly assert that this nomination
was given to the Silver Republicans with
the full understanding that a Silver Re
publican should receive the nomination,
or --lse, they argue, why were the Silver
Republicans recognized at all. The Sil
ver Republicans nominated, or rather in
dorsed, the Republican nominee, Henry
Dalton, and the anti-Fitzgerald folks de
clare that this was the result of a secret
deal made in the interest of Edward Fitz
gerald, recently nominated in San Fran
cisco for Public Administrator. It is
claimed that Robert Fitzgerald entered
into a deal by which I>alton's friends se
cured his indorsement by the allied con
vention In return for certain support
across the bay for "his brother Edward.
This has so antagonized the English-Lay
mance wing of the Democracy that they
positively declared to-day an independ
ent candidate for Assessor would cer
tainly be placed upon the ticket.
The Populists ;ire dissatisfied because
they were anxious to nominate Sheriff
"White to succeed himself, and were,
forced to give this office to the Democrats.
As the Populists were already spilt before
fusion was broached, and are now divided
again Into the Dutton and White wings
of the party, their vote may safely be
classified at this time as scattering.
Many Silver Republicans declare that
th<*y were not consulted regarding the di
vision of the spoils, or If they had been.
thiy would have demanded that they be
given the office of Recorder, which they
wanted for A. K. Grim, who is a Sliver
Republican. They declare that the notn
j inatlon of a Republican by the Silver Re
; publicans is simply a farce and that they
were Jobbed.
The Republicans are highly elated at
; the turn that fusion politics has taken.
: There is more confusion in the allied
I ranks than there was two years ago when
every fusion candidate on the ticket was
; beaten.
ROOSEVELT SEEMS TO
HAVE A CLEAR FIELD
Believed Black Will Not Go Into
the New York Republican
Convention.
SARATOGA. N. V., Sept. 26.â There Is
hardly an impartial observer here to
night who does not believe that the ticket
to be nominated by the Republican State
Convention to-morrow will be headed by-
Colonel Theodore Roosevelt for Governor
and Timothy L. Woodruff for Lieutenant
Governor.
Chauncey M. Depew, who is to name
Mr. Roosevelt, arrived here during the
afternoon and is positive that his candi
date has an almost clear field. It was
pretty well decided late to-night that
Governor Black will not go into the con
vention. His friends are urging him to
do so, but up to this time he has stoutly
maintalned that it would not be dignified.
ITALY ACCEPTS THE
CZAR'S INVITATION
Willing to Participate in the Peace
Conference, but Fears Unfore
seen Difficulties.
ROME, Sept. 26.â The Government has
pent to Russia a diplomatically worded
acceptance of the Czar's invitation
to take part in an International
â¢ peace conference. In its note of
I acceptance the Government expresses
sympathy with and admiration for
the objects of the Czar, but says it
â¢ fears that difficulties will arise over the
; discussion of questions other than that
! of armament which "might accentuate in
j the very heart of the projected confer
ence a conflict of opinions, the conse
quences of â which would not leave us
without anxiety."
The Government suggests that the Czar
eliminate this possibility by formulating
a definite programme limiting the dis
cussions to the central idea.
CHILE ANn ARGENTINA
ARE COMING TO TERMS
No Doubt That Their Differences
Will Be Peacefully Settled
by Arbitration.
VAI/PARAISO. Chile. Sept. 26.â A1l dif
ferences between Chile -na Argentina
undoubtedly will be settled peaceably. I
am informed that both Governments have
agreed that the dispute over Puna Ata
cama is to be submitted to arbitration,
once the co-operation of Bolivia is ob
tained. The Chilean boundary expert,
Senor Barros Arana, has accepted the
post of envoy in arbitration by Queen Vic
toria of the dispute over the southern
boundary. A protocol with Peru will be
discussed and approved by Congress this
week.
ON THE FIELD OF LABOR
United States Peace Commission Ar-
rives in Paris.
PARIS. Sept. 2Â«.â The Pence Commis
sion of the United States arrived here to
day from L.ondon and was met at the
railroad station by the United States Em
bassy, a number of Americans and many
reporters. A considerable crowd outside
the depot witnessed the departure of the
Commissioners for their hotels. The
journey from England to this city was
uneventful.

NEW YORK, Sept. 26.â A special to the

assistant chief of the bureau of naviga
tion, has made arrangements to leave

DREYFUS TRIAL
TO BE REVISED
Decision of the French
Cabinet.
OVATION TO THE MINISTERS
CHEERED BY EXCITED CROWDS
ON THE STREETS.
Rochefort Accuses Esterhazy of Hav
ing Been Bribed to Cover Him
self With Dishonor oy
Confessing.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, Sept. 26.â At amo ing of the
Cabinet this morning, all the Ministers
being present, a decision was taken in
favor of the revision of the trial of
former Ca^t .i- Dreyfus and the docu
ments in the case will be sent to the
Court of Cassation.
The crowds of people outside the
offices of the Ministry of the Interior,
where the Cabinet council wad held,
loudly cheered 'he Ministers and there
were shouts of "Vive Brisson." "Vive
le Revision."
The Cabinet ordered the Minister of
Juatlâ > M. Sarrien, to lay before the
Court of Cassation the petition of
Mme. Dreyfus, vife of the p-isoner
of Devils Island, for a revision of her
husband's case. The court, therefore,
will decide the legal question as to
whether the first trial of Captain Drey
fus was vitiated by the forgery com
mitted by the late Lieutenant Colonel
Henry, who was a witness before the
court-martial and w r ho confessed to
having forged a document in the case.
The Cabinet meeting waa prolonged
and animated. The Minister of Agri
culture, M. Viger, is reported to have
bitterly opposed a revision and It Is
rumored he will resign.
The Minister of Justice has an
nounced that he has given Instructions
that proceedings are to be taken im
mediately against any one attacking
the army.
It is supposed that the Instructions
to prosecute any one attacking the
army were Issued at the request of
General Chanoine.
The city is excited and the Bourse is
in a disturbed condition. It is doubt
ful If the action of the Cabinet Is popu
lar among the masses, especially the
common people, who. It is pointed out,
still cling to the fetich of the honor of
the army.
In the Intransigeant to-day Henri
Rochefort accuses Major Esterhazy of
having been bribed by the so-called
Dreyfus syndicate to "cover himself
with dishonor by confessing to a for
gery of which he was twice acquitted."
M. Rochefort adds that he paid Es
terhazy 1000 francs for copies of all
the documents in the case and that, in
addition, with two other newspaper
men, he paid Esterhazy, who was lit
erally without a centime, 300 francs
monthly to prevent him from going
hungry while waiting to obtain a pen
sion. Continuing, M. Rochefort says:
"Recently, without any apparent in
centive, Esterhazy mysteriously went
to London, abandoning his 300 francs
monthly. Why this emigration? Who
paid for his Journey? With what
money has Esterhazy paid for his
meals?"
M. Clemenceau, in the Aurore, re
marks: "France is divided into two
camps, those who conceive that the in
terests of the country depend on the
concealment of facts by lies and those
who have a sufficiently high esteem of
the country to separate enthusiasm
from the aspirations of justice and
truth."
The Libre Parole asserts that Ester
hazy has telegraphed to the Minister
of War, General Chanolne, protesting
against the story published in the Ob
server of London, purporting to be a
confession made by the major, the sub
stance of which was that he was the
author of the bordereau, a document
which Is said to have furnished proof
of the guilt of Dreyfus.

Charges of Favoritism to Railroads
Will Receive Special Atten

Procedure.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. Sept. 26.â The com
mission selected by the President to in
vestigate the conduct of the War De
partment held its first formal session
to-day, with all the members present.
The meeting was in the room of the
Fortification and Ordnance Board of^
the Department, but it was found to be
too small for the purpose, and it was
announced that future meetings would
be held in apartments secured in the
Lemon building on New York avenue.
To-day's meeting was strictly secret.
No newspaper representatives or others
not connected with the board were ad
mitted.
After a meeting of two hours' dura
tion, an adjournment was taken until
10 o'clock to-morrow. The proceedings
were limited to the outlining of a gen
eral policy and the formulation of let
ters of inquiry, which will be made
public to-morrow.
The letters decided upon are to be
addressed to the Secretary of War, the
quartermaster general, the commissary
general, the surgeon general and the
chief of the Ordnance Department of
the army. They will consist in the
main of inquiries intending to bring
out all the facts that can be given rel
ative to the organization of the volun
teer army. These officials will be asked
to give special Information, so as to
cover each of the departments in ques
tion, concerning tho condition of the
army, both at the beginning and the
close of the war. For this purpose a
date in April has been selected as the
one for the beginning of the prepara
tion, and another in August for the
close.
The questions are so formulated as
to call out answers covering the or
ganization of camps, the purchase of
supplies and the taking of contracts
with transportation companies and also
to show the methods adopted for fur
nishing supplies to the various com
mands and for protecting the health of
the soldiers. There will be an espe
cial effort to develop the motives that
actuated the department in the choice
of camp sites, as there have been
charges of favoritism to railroad com
panies.
The commission also considered seve
ral letters of complaint from persons
professing to have Information bear
ing upon the subject of the investiga
tion, and decided to address replies to
the writers, requiring them to put their
charges in specific shape and inform
ing them of the scope of the inquiry.
It is intended, if the replies received
to these letters show the writers to be
in possession of real information, to
summon them before the commission
when it is feasible to do so. otherwise
to secure their affidavits. When, how
ever, it becomes evident that their ac
cusations are mere idle complaints,
with no information to back them,
the writers will receive no further at
tention.
The commission expects to extend its
inquiry before it closes its work to the
extent of summoning before it the com
manding officers of the various divi
sions and brigades and probably the
colonels of regiments from which com
plaints have emanated. They will be
expected to give full information as to
the pains they may have taken or failed
to take concerning the location of their
troops and their eronpral welfare.

If the Allied Companies Are Victori

Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDDING, Sept. 26.â A proposition
at law which, if carried to a successful
issue, means the closing of the public
schools, the cessation of road work and
the practical impoverishment of Trin
ity County, is now in full swing 1 . Five
of the largest and wealthiest mining
corporations of Trinity County have in
stituted suit against County Clerk Car
ter to wipe from the assessment rolls
the increased assessments of the several
companies levied by the Board of
Equalization. The suits are brought
against the County Clerk for the reason
that the assessment roll has been re
ceipted for by him from the Assessor,
and is therefore not in the latter's
possession.
The Board of Supervisors, sitting as
a Board of Equalization, cited the sev
eral corporations to appear and show
cause why their several assessments
should not be raised. Representatives
appeared before the board and after
giving them a hearing at a stormy ses
sion lasting several days the Board of
Equalization raised the several assess
ments as follows:

Brown Bear Mining Company. S',ooo 21,500
The wealthy mine owners who own
or control the great properties just
enumerated formed a pool and decided
to carry the question, which is far
reaching in its effects, into the civil
courts. They have employed ex-Sena
tor C. W. Cross of San Francisco to
prosecute their claims. R. L. Carter of
Trinity County and the law firm of
Garter Dozier & Wells of Redding and
Red Bluff have been retained to look
after Trinity County's interests.
The Chloride Bailey mines, originally
assessed at $500 and raised to $15 000
were recently sold to a domestic syn
dicate for $30,000. Homer Wilson, a
financial agent of Pan Francisco, pro
moted the sale. A fine ten-stamp mill
has been added to the property's equip
ment. The Altoona Quicksilver Min
ing Company is regarded as one of the
best mining properties in the State
having an output monthly of 600 flasks
of quicksilver. The company has one
pump in its great modern plant worth
double the original assessment. The
Brown Bear mine is the famous prop
erty from which Henry Martin derived
the fortune which Mrs. John Martin
sought in the courts to share. Baron
E. de la Grang- of Paris is at the head
of the French syndicate owning La
Grange hydraulic mines, controlling an
immense acreage of the richest gravel
deposits in Trinity County. This com
pany lately put in a siphon line of two
foot hydraulic pipe on which the rail
road freight alone from the East to
Redding amounted to over $9000. The
company also drove a water canal
tunnel which required two years to
finish.
If the mine owners win their suit it
means a loss to Trinity County of $5000
annually. Trinity is sparsely settled
and many of the county offices are
combined so that such a shortage in
reality means to that isolated com
munity what a deficit of several hun
dred thousand dollars would mean to
San Francisco.
One factor that was of importance in
the bringing of the suit by the pool
of mine owners was the recent sale of
the Chloride-Bailey group. Unless the
assessment as raised by the Board of
Equalization is paid clear title cannot
be given by .he original owners.

THE MARKET STREET PAVEMENT.
OX E need not search far afield for the reasons
which have determined Superintendent Am
brose of the Street Department to advise the
Supervisors to discontinue the repaying of Market
street upon the completion of the present contracts.
There is no scarcity of funds. The levy for the depart
ment is as large within a few thousands as last year,
and there is no reason why a portion of the money
should not be used in extending the bitumen on Mar
ket street to Valencia. In fact, no figures have been
offered to show that the amount appropriated for
Market street last year cannot be appropriated this
year.
The inspiration of Superintendent Ambrose is found
in the system under which he works. If Market street
is bituminized to -Valencia the work will be awarded
to a contractor who will employ his own men and
machinery and bay his own materials. If the money
in the Street Department fund is expended in clean
ing sewers, repairing accepted streets and paving in
front of city property it will be expended under the
direction of the officials of the Street Department. In
other words, Mr. Ambrose will then do the employ
ing and will himself buy the material.
This accounts for the milk in the cocoanut. In one
case it is a business proposition, in which all the peo
ple of the city are interested; in the other^it is a case
of "doing" some Democratic politics with the public
money.
If Superintendent Ambrose shall, after reflection,
conclude to send in a recommendation to abandon
the repaying of Market street to Valencia, we trust
the Board of Supervisors will place it in a pigeon
. hole. Making Democratic politics under ordinary
circumstances is not a bad thing, and we are far from
objecting to it. For instance, we did not object when
Mayor Phelan tore up the tracks on Market street,
though as a Republican journal we knew he under
took the work as a vote-getting scheme. But sub
stantially all the people in San Francisco are interest
ed in jepaving Market street to Valencia. The
thoroughfare is practically worn out and has long
been a disgrace to the city. Replacing the street with
bitumen may not be the best thing that can be done
with it, but the Mayor and Supervisors have decided
on such a pavement, and they ought not to stop short
of completing the work. Certainly they should not
permit the political necessities of the Street Depart
ment Democrats to interfere with so just a public en
terprise.
Ofcouxse, in common with his other admiring con
stituents, we shall regret to see the political powers
of Mr. Ambrose curtailed. But there ought to be
some other way of "doing" Democratic politics than
using the money of the Street Department to pay for
corner grocery discussions of the merits of the various
candidates for municipal office. It is notorious that
during campaigns the employes of the Street Depart
ment never work.
THE EARLY RAINS.
OUR early rains have begun this year with
showers of such profusion as to give promise
that we are to have anything rather than a dry
winter this season. They have, moreover, been wide
spread, and have carried their blessings to almost
every section of the State.
That some damage will result from such general
rains this early in the year is certain. A considerable
part oi the prune crop is in process of drying, and
the rain where it has been heavy will entail loss of
some of the fruit and a good deal of expense in saving
the rest that was exposed to the showers. Moreover
the grape crop may be more or less hurt, but reports
are to the effect that the injury to that crop is not ex
pected to be great in any part of the State.
It is worth noting that from nearly all the centers
of the fruit and grape industry it. is announced that
the warnings of the Weather Bureau of the coming of
the si.owers were given in time to enable the orchard
ists and vineyardists to prepare for them. Prunes that
had been spread for drying were stacked before the
rains came, and the loss therefore was much smaller
than it would have been otherwise. The usefulness of
the bureau has thus been again demonstrated, and
when all rural workers learn to pay attention to its re
ports the profit from its labors will be even greater
than now.
In any case, however, the losses from the showers
would have been slight in comparison with the gains
that will result from the early coming of the begin
ning of the rainy season. The drought has been long
and severe. It was beginning to tell upon the vitality
of the orchards in many sections, and fears were ex
pressed whether the trees would be able to form buds
for the fruit of next year. The showers have come in
time, it is to be hoped, to put an end to all anxieties
on that score, and to give every rural industry reason
for the hope o( en abundant harvest in 1899.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, TUESDAY, PEI'TF/MHETI 27, 1808.
J. HOM LEWIS.
f^ ONGRESSMAN J. HAM LEWIS of Wash
l ington has passed across the stage of California
politics like a resplendent pageant. He has
faded in the distance, a vision of hair, whiskers and
fine raiment, and the odors of Araby linger in his
trail. For one too brief night he stood upon the plat
form of Metropolitan Temple and shed a sumptuous
illumination upon our local campaign, and then re
tired into his bandbox and left us, creased trousers
and all, for the more appreciative precincts of Puget
Sound.
His business here was to arraign the Republican
party for not keeping its pledges. He did not sob
forth his sorrow. It is not an inarticulate grief with
J. Ham. Its expression requires a resort to all the
parts of speech. But his set and permanent melan
choly over Republican shortcomings did not hinder
him in taking his audience into his confidence when
he came to boast that he had taken away the Demo
cratic leadership from Bailey, the tall Texan, and ap
propriated it to himself, .with all the hereditaments and
muniments of power. This part of his speech pre
sented himself, J. Ham Lewis, as the Dewey of the
campaign, who manned the parliamentary conning
tower, and by use of telephone, speaking tube and
wig-wag, silenced tht guns and drowned the ships of
Monti jo Bailey, and made him take water in a row
boat and leave his flag behind him. It was a pleasure
to look upon the rare and radiant, the airy, fairy and
iridescent person of the victor in this fight for lead
ership on the stormy Congressional waters.
Having captured leadership by the use of the smoke
less powder of oratory, J. Ham must hold it by turn
ing his vocal Krupp upon the Republicans, and he did
it. They have not kept their pledges is the casus belli
which this land and water, marine and submarine and
ultra-marine, warrior asserted as the reason for his
devastating presence on the platform of Metropolitan
Temple.
An examination of the record since McKinley's in
auguration, as shown in the reliable, non-partisan sta
tistics of commerce and finance, may be the means of
confining this opalescent and scintillating statesman
to an account of his victory over Bailey to the aban
donment of discussion of mere politics.
The day Bryan was nominated in 1896 the money in
circulation in this country was $1,506,434,966. Just
two years later it was $1,843,435,749, or an increase of
more than half a million dollars a day for the whole
period, or $20,000 an hour. Yet Mr. Bryan and his
men declared that in 1896 the only way to increase the
volume of circulation was by the free coinage of silver
at 16 to I. and the Republican party said the way to
increase it was by sound credit and restored confi
dence. The gold in circulation when Mr. Bryan was
nominated amounted to $454,005,064; when he was de
feated it increased at once to $516,340,279. A month
aftci McKinley's inauguration it was $517,125,757. By
December 1. 1897. it was $544,494,748. It went on in
creasing last winter in the face of certain war with
Spain, and on April i, after the Maine was destroyed
and war resolutions were pending, it was $582,129,724.
Then came the war, and in the midst of it, on July 1,
1898. when Shafter was hammering at the walls of
Santiago, the gold circulation stood at $660,959,880,
the largest amount in the history of this country. The
total circulation at the same date of all kinds of money
and every dollar of it at par in gold was $1,843,
4.35.749- This is the largest circulation in the history
of the country, and the largest per capita, for it
amounted to $24 74 per head of population.
In 1806 Mr. Bryan and the prismatic J. Ham Lewis
said that low prices were caused by the denial of free
coinage of silver at a ratio of 16 to I, and that prices
would never rise until the country had free silver.
Bradstreet's comparison of prices for July 1, 1896, and
July, 1808, proves that this pot of silver, the raise in
prices, was not at the place where the Bryan rainbow
touched the earth. That comparison shows:
1896 1898
Beef per bbl J 8.50 $11.30
Pork r>er bbl 8.25 10.00
Baron per lb 04 3-8 .06
Lard per 1b 04 1-5 .05 1-2
Beef in carcass IT) 05 1-2 .07 2-3
Hogs In carcass tb 03 7-8 .04 4-5
Mutton In carcass Ib 05 1-2 .08 1-2
Horses 65.00 85.00
Wool, O. Pa., per tb 16 .25
Wheat 64 3-8 .86
Rye 37 1-2 .52
Oats 211-2 .26
Throughout the list, including beans, barley, flour,
cotton seed, hops, flax, tobacco and hides, the increase
run? fom 16 to 25 per cent in prices. In addition to
this the balance of trade in our favor July I, 1898, was
$615,324,791, for during the year we had exported our
products to the amount of $1,231,329,950, and had im
ported only $616,005,159. So that we sold twice as
much as we bought and took the balance in gold and
liquidated obligations held abroad.
The effect of sound credit and sound money has
been felt throughout all the channels of trade, and has
changed the position of this country to the rest of the
world. Instead of being the world's debtor we are
the creditor nation, with the prospect of increasing
the debts of the nations to us during the next two
years.
J. Ham Lewis has come and gone, like a beautiful
e'ream. He was a lovely figment, but he leaves be
hind the impression that his charms are not for this
practical world. Let him hie to Arcadia and com
pare feathers with the lyre bird, or go down to Ore
gon to compete with the iris and gold of the cock
pheasant from Mongolia, who shames the glories of
the firefly, by the clear-winding Willamette.
BETTER THAN IMPERIALISM.
/â ""* OMMENTING upon the readiness of the peo
t pie to sustain Congress in voting large sums of
money for war purposes and the certainty that
the jingo programme of colonial expansion will entail
even larger expenditures than those caused by the
brief conflict with Spain, the Pittsburg Dispatch points
out that since the nation is rich enough to bear the
burdens of taxation necessary to provide for these ex
penditures, it would be better to apply the money to
internal improvements than to foreign adventures.
The Dispatch says: "The sum of $500,000,000 ex
pended in improving the rivers of the nation, in con
necting the rivers with the lakes and the lakes with
the ocean, would give the entire population between
the Rocky Mountains and the Atlantic coast the
cheapest transportation in the world. A similar sum
expended in establishing irrigation on the arid lands
of the West would add more than 60,000,000 acres to
the productive area of the United States and increase
the wealth of the country by over $1,200,000,000/"
The proposition of course does not come within
the domain of practical politics, but it is worth con
sideration in contrast with the proposed expenditure
of hundreds of millions to establish a colonial system
and educate the mongrel races of the tropics in the
art of self-government.
It is a failing of humanity that both individuals and
nations are more willing to spend money for the sake
of prestige and cutting a big figure in the world than
to provide for comfort at home. Therefore money
for war is more easy to obtain than for internal im
provements.
Nevertheless the Dispatch is right in saying: "The
turning of public attention and public expenditure to
these and cognate questions will give the people of the
United States more real return than all the pchtfMl
for spending money for "imperialism" in savage hikl
antipodal regions.
THE CAMPAIGN IN CALIFORNIA.
WHATEVER defeat and disaster may a waif
them on election day, the fused faction* ol dis
content have at least fulfilled their boftlt of
forcing State issues to the front during the campaign
By nominating for Governor so irresponsible a dema
gogue as James G. Maguire on a platform s<> tht<\U
ening to all the interests of the thrifty and ittduitfioui
classes of the people, they have compelled intelligent
men to recognize that the chief issue in the contest
is that of preserving the State from the domination of
the Maguires and the Gallaghers.
The issue is the more -pressing because the pros
pcrity which followed the accession of McKinlry t<>
office and the speedy enactment of a Republican t.irilT
for the protection of American industry hns resulted
in a renewed activity among capitalists in the direc
tion of large investments and great enterprises. This
has been accompanied by a revival of the westward
march of progressive young men looking for places
in which to establish business and make permanent
homes. California, having vast resources undeveloped
and millions of acres uncultivated, will naturally at
tract many of these home-seekers, but the attraction
will be in vain if the government of the State should
at this juncture be politically unsound and antagonis
tic to capital.
If this had been a year of industrial distress and
financial embarrassment, if thousands of people were
out of work and times were hard, the Maguire move
ment would be everywhere recognized as one of the
most dangerous in our annals. Then its true nature
would have been revealed and its hostility to property
and industry would have shown itself in fierce denun
ciations of all kinds of thrift and all forms of con
servatism. As it is the leaders have had to be some
what mild in their harangues, but none the less they
have said and done enough to exhibit the reckless
character of their policies and their principles. To
defeat them is therefore a necessary step toward our
continuance in the paths of prosperity. It is a State
issue which no property-owner, business man or in
dustrious worker can ignore.
THE SITUATION fIT FASMODA.
GENERAL KITCHENER'S advance guard has
reached Fashoda and found there a French
force under Major Marchand. The British
commander notified the French that Great Britain
claims the territory and demanded their retirement.
Marchand replied courteously that France claims the
territory, and in turn demanded that the British retire.
The incident closed for the time with the opposing
forces encamped within view of each other; there to
remain on friendly terms until the diplomats of Lon
don and Paris decide which shall retire.
The situation is strikingly like, one which occurred
between the forces of the same nations when they
were struggling for supremacy in this country during
the middle of the last century. The British colonists
along the Atlantic had extended their outposts to the
crests of the Alleghenies, and claimed the Ohio River
region beyond. A French force marched down from
Canada and 9tarted to establish a fort at the point
where Pittsburgh now stands. George Washington,
then serving in the British army as a major of the
Virginia colonial troops, was sent forward to warn
the daring Frenchmen to vacate the territory, and did
so, coming up with their advance guard some dis
tance from the site where the fort was in process of
construction.
Up to that point the incident in America 150 years
ago was almost exactly like that in Africa to-day. The
results of the meeting of the two forces in the last cen
tury, however, were very different from those which
have followed from the meeting at Fashoda. There
was no courteous interchange of compliments and
patient waiting for diplomatists in the old days. Wash
ington attacked the French as soon as he met them,
and the fight that followed was the beginning of a war
that did not end until the French were driven out of
not only the Ohio River region, but Canada as well.
It will be seen the civilized world has made a long
stride since the last century. Nations are no longer
to be hurried into wars by the rash actions of com
manders of distant outposts. The pen of the diplo
matist in the capital dominates the sword of the war
rior even in the wilderness of barbarous lands, and
compels armies to halt in the face of one another in
stead of fighting as soon as they meet.
Tennyson, when in a fit of pessimism he wrote
"Maud," denounced with no little indignation this
curbing of the military valor of men, and said with
scorn: "The jingling of the guinea helps the hurt
that honor feels; and the nations do but murmur,
snarling at each other's heels." Few intelligent men,
however, will regret the change that has come over
the world. The incident at Fashoda will not be so
heroic a record on the pages of history as that which
took place on the frontier of Pennsylvania in the last
century, but it will none the less be a proof of the ad
vancing civilization of both the British and the
French.
Even the Memphis Commercial-Appeal takes up
the warfare against the First Tennessee stationed at
this point. It should bear in mind that in this regi
ment are about 150 untamed moonshiners, caught in
the Southern mountains, and never before brought
into contact with any civilization save that represent
ed by revenue officers. The rest of the regiment is
made up of as good blood as has gone to the front,
and the officers are gentlemen to whom the conduct
of the few scalawags has caused greater pain than it
could have caused to any one else.
There is no use in jumping to the conclusion that
California volunteers want to be mustered out of the
service, nor that the purpose for which they were
called to arms has been fully accomplished. On the
other hand, some who are being mustered out do not
accept the situation joyously, and there is no assur
ance that grave work does not await in the Philip
pines.
Charles Van Alstine, a returned Klondiker, who
married on a few hours' acquaintance, is reported as
"alarmed" because his wife has disappeared with most
of his ready cash. There is not the slightest occasion
for alarm or even surprise. While his belief that there
hag been foul play is well founded, Charles may be
reasonably assured that he is the only victim of it.
It is a fortunate circumstance that Aguinaldo should
have the columns of a New York paperthrough which
to address the people of the <vorld. It gives some
space writer the assurance of being able to look the
landlady in the face.
At last there seems to be a growing impression that
the Spanish must get out of Cuba. If recollection is
not at fault, American troops were sent there under
the stimulus of the same idea.
Highwaymen in the Klondike have begun to rob
and murder. Thus do the influences of a benign civ
ilization reach into and permeate the Arctic circle.

Ju.st what will be done by the Supervi
sors regarding the project to bitumlnize
to Valencia Htrett will probably develop
within tlie next week, after the Street
Committee shall have had time to form
ulate a report. The chances seem fairly
good for the Improvement to be ordereu,
despite the objections of Air. Ambrose.
The board took no further notice of tne
recent communication from the Grand
Jury to the effect that it needed $5000 for
the purpose of conducting an expert In
vestigation Into certain municipal affairs.
On recommendation of the Finance Com
mittee the communication was iiled with
out comments,
Bateman BroÃ. were given until Janu
ary 1, 1899, to finish the Hall of Justice.
Xhe Clerk was instructed to advertise
for proposals for sweeping and cleaning
public streets for a period of two years
from December 1, 1898.
,On recommendation of the Committee
on Health and Police, the Supervisors un
animously directed tfiat a two years
lease of the premises, 507 and 509 Stanyan
street, be effected, the same to be used
as a 'police station and the rental to be
$166 per month. On its face the little reso
lution looked innocent enough, but later
Mayor Phelan raised a question. "I un
derstand," said he, "that there are no
such numbers as 507 and 509 Stanyan.
How is that?" 4>38
"Well," replied Delany, "the property
that we want to lease is that now occu
pied by Devany & Hopkins, the bicycle
firm."
"Supervisor Devany?" queried the
Mayor.
"Yes," it is rented by Devany & Hop
kins from Dr. Ragan of the School
Board," replied the captain. "The build-
Ing is to be refitted at Ragan's expense.
The lease will provide that.
Subsequently there was some explana
tion demanded by the reporters. There
upon Delany made this statement: "We
do not consider the rent too high, in view
of the fact that Ragan will have to ex
pend $3000 on the building to put it in
proper condition for use as a police sta
tion."
This statement was somewhat mystify
ing in view of the fact that $3000 expended
by Dr. Ragan, out of two years' rental,
would only leave him $984 profit, rather
a small sum. considering the location of
the property and the size of the build
ing, 60 by 100 feet.
"I don't understand It," was Mayor
Phelan's remark after the meeting ad
journed. "Property out in that neigh
borhood ought not to rent at such a fig
ure." It Is highly probable that Super
visor Delany will be called upon by the
Mayor to explain which is getting the
worst of the deal, the city or Ragan.
Stipervieor Devany claims to have no In
terests in the lease, alleging that Hopkins
and himself merely rented of Ragan and
are about to seek another location. Â
âSupervisor Mnrtun was granted " thirty
days leave of absence from the State to
attend to private business.
A contract was awarded for the steam
plant at the Almshouse for $5550. Phil
lips & Smyth were granted a contract for
printing 2000 copies of the general order
for $1.70 per page.
The name of Morton street was changed
to Union Square. x
â William Tobin, Janitor of Police Court
No. 2, was dismissed and his place given
to John Devereaux.
Supervisor. Sheehan presented for con
sideration an ordinance prohibiting the
circulation, or distribution, of lottery
tickets, scrolls or devices, making the
same a misdemeanor, punishable by a
$20 to $500 fine, or imprisonment from ten
days to six months. Consideration was
deferred until next meeting. ~.
Supervisor Delany handed In a resolu
tion to take the license off nil nickel-in
the-slot machines, so that they could be
operated without restrictions, at the same
time prohibiting gaming with cards and
dice. This remarkable move In favor of
the nickel gambling machines will be
brought to the attention of the full
Board at Its next meeting.

8 HORSES ON
Â« THE
B COLONEL.
$ .
CfOOfOOOOOOO had sen adventure
which has advanced him three numbers
among the Palace Guards, of which Colo
nel Chadbourne is . senior officer. The
usual Saturday, night assemblage was in
session, and no .matter what was said in
the way of risque stories. Colonel Doo
llttle maintained a deep silence. Some one
noticed that his mind was far away and
made mention of it. The colonel came
out of his trance and told his tale:
"Gentlemen of the unspotted brigade,
whose honor has never been questioned,
my Badness is due to horses. Oh, no, I
have not been to the races. Worse, I
have been investing in horse-flesh. I
was about to make a trip up the coun
try a few days ago and I wanted to buy
a horpe for my own use. A friend ad
vised me to go to the stock yards, where
I would certainly get one very cheap. I
went, and he went with me. There the
horses stood around with numbers plas
tered, on their backs â skates- with every
variety of disorder known to Veterinary
experts. The catalogue of diseases which
Petruchio recites- in 'Taming of the
Shrew' were all materialized. Out of the
lot I noticed one horse with number 17
on his side. He was sound in wind and
beautiful of form, and I determined to
buy- him when the auction began. Soon
after the sale on number 17 was called
and I stripped for work. Ten dollars, $20,
$30, up .it went, and before I knew where
I was I had offered $80 for the horse. It
Eeemed to me that this was pretty stiff,
but I never like to be beat, and I stayed
with It. Finally I won at 190; the rest
had â  dropped out. â  .
"I felt pretty good, and after the sale
I went over to the auctioneer to see about
the delivery of the horse. He directed
me to one of the corrals. I asked for
number 17, and ten men. each leading a
skate, rushed up to me.. I had bought a
lot of useless horse-flesh. You see num
ber 17 was a lot and I got the entire
works. What will I do with them? I
don't know^ That's what- makej me
sad."

DEATHS AND
CASUALTIES
OS THE FRONT
Captain and Sailor of
the Scotia Drowned.
FATALITY ON THE BLAIRMORE
A CHIPPER KILLED BY A FALL
INTO THE HOLD.
Arrival of the Steam Whaler ITew
port Prom the Arctic â She
Brings No Additional
News.
It Tvas "blue Monday" on the water
front yesterday. Four deaths, several
accidents and a number of captains seri
ously ill was the record for the day, and
it has not been equaled for a long time.
Two of the deaths were by drowning,
one was from falling down the hold of
a ship, and the other due to natural
causes. All in all it was a day that will
not soon be forgotten.
The steam schooner Scotia left here on
the 21st inst. for Rockport, Meniloeino
County, and arrived there the next day.
It was too rough to load, so Captain
Hansen stood oft and on with his vessel
and filially managed to make fast to the
mooring buoy last Sunday. The southeast
er that blew here Saturday night worked
its way up the coast, and yesterday it
suddenly became very rough at Kock
port. In order to save his vessel Captain
Hansen hau to slip hTs inoorings and put
to sea.
It was very rough, but the captain was
quite anxious to get word to his owners
in this city, so he had a boat lowered
and v.ith three seamen started in it for
the beach. Before half the distance hail
been covered the boat capsized and Cap
tain Frithof. Hansen and a sailor, sup
posed to be V. Euglund, were drowned.
Another sailor reached the capsized boat
and was washed ashore on it. The fourth
man swam into the breakers and the
people of Rockport, who were all on the
beach, managed to get a line to him and
he was dragged ashore.
When the boal capsized the Scotia
stood out to sea, and last night was
about two miles off shore, waiting for the
captain to return. The supposition is
that Captain Hansen wanted one or the
other of his mates to take the message
ashore, and when they refused on ac
count of the weather he undertook the
dangerous task himself.
The above particular* were received by
telephone from Rockport. The following
was sont to the Merchants' Exchange:
Capiain Hansen was formerly a quar
termaster in the employ of the Pacific
Coast Steamship Company. Then he
became mate of the Scotia, but last Jan
uary was made master. He was a very
careful- man, and knew the coast well.
He leaves a widow and six children.
Another death took place on the Blair
more yeÃterday. Over two years ago the
bark capsized in Mission bay and several
of the officers and men were drowned.
When the vessel was raised the owners
and underwriters began fighting over the
insurance money, and It was only a month
or so ago that the matter was settled
The Blairmore was then sold and docked
at "Harrison street wharf to be re-rigged
and fitted out. Yesterday while several
men were chipping the rust from the in-
Klde of the vessel an elderly chipper
known as "Captain" Edward Gregg, lost
hjs balance and fell into the lower hold
He died before a physician could reach
Michael Fey had an ankle broken and

CELEBRATED
THE DAY OF
ATONEMENT
Observed With Fast
ing and Prayer.
SYNAGOGUES WERE CROWDED
RABBIS DELIVER MOST ELO
QUENT SERMONS.
Devotional Services Mark the Most
Solemn and Sacred Day
of the Jewish
Year.
The most sacred and solemn day of the
Jewish year, Yom Klppur, was observed
yesterday with full ceremonies in all the
synagogues. It was the day of atonement
and fasting and the solemnity of the
services held the worshipers from the
early morning till the setting of the sun.
The Yom Kippur services of Sunday
night ushered in the prayers and fasting
which continued until 6 o'clock last night.
The choirs of the Temple Emanu-El and
Sherlth Israel were augmented and the
beautiful and soul-stirring music of the
services at both synagogues was exquis
itely ' rendered. The white drapery, the
dim lights and the flowers lent solemnity
to the congregations of worshipers ab
sorbed in the devotional observance of
the day.
At the Temple Emanu-El every seat
was occupied from the beginning of the
services to the last prayer. Rabbi Jacob
Yocrsanger lectured early in the after
noon on a subject consonant with the
import of the day. His words were full
of warning and carried to the hearts of
his auditors the great blessings that came
from a life of religion, piety and good
aese in the liberal een.se of the words.
Rabbi Kieto of Sherlth Israel spoke
eloquently on the meaning of the day of
atonement. "The True Jew" was his
theme, which he treated in eloquent and
masterful style. He closed hia oration
with an exhortation to his hearers to look
well into their lives and strive to keep
In the paths of virtue and righteousness
and shun the habits of sin.
Rabbi M. S. Levy lectured at the noon
hour before an audience that fairly
packed the Geary-street Temple. He re
viewed the history of Judaism and ex
plained why the day of atonement should
be observed with full solemnity. Ilia
words were replete with religious elo
quence and went straight to the hearts
of his congregation.
The memorial services which be#an late
In the* afternoon at all the houses of
worship wre most impressive. The
names of those who died during the year
were mentioned and special prayers deliv
ered for them.
HER DAUGHTERS PERJURY.
idmission of Mrs. Tread-well's Moth-
er in the Reay Suit.
The old suit of J. M. Reay against
Mabel Treadwell, individually as execu
trix of the will of J. P. Treadwell; C. G.
Warren, as administrator of the estate of
John Butler and Arthur Inkersley, as
special administrator of the estate of P.
H. Owens, in which the plaintiff seeks to
recover titlo and possession of some fifty
acres of land in the. Dana tract, near the
old Lone Mountain Cemetery, is now be
ing heard by Judge Hebbard.
In 1862, the plaintiff .alleges, .he pur
chased the property from P. H. Owens
Subsequently J. P. Treadwell, at the head
of an armed following, drove off the em
ployes of the plaintiff and destroyed the
Improvements. The other defendants held
and still claim adverse titles.
The suit has occupied the attention of
the courts for decades. Shortly after
Treadwell's death the action was heard
in part. During the hearing it developed
that an affidavit of Frederick William
had been abstracted from the papers In
the case. Mrs. Treadwell was suspected
of having taken the document and was
summoned to appear and testify regard
ing its loss. She stated that she knew
nothing of the document, and the trial
progressed. Yesterday was the first day
of the second hearing. Mrs. Katherine
Summers, mother of Mrs. Treadwell, wÂ»s
placed upon the stand and made some ad
missions that would have produced a pro
found sensation had Mrs. Treadwell been
alive to answer. Mrs. Summers testified
that her daughter uiq !Â».:â "â Â«Â» the document
in her possession during the first hear
ing of the case, and misled the court when
she stated otherwtae. Mrs. Summers also
testified that during the first hearing of
the ease, when the testimony of Leopold
Markgraff was rmtch wanted by the plain
tiff, she saw her daughter go to Con
Crowley, give him some money and tell
him to Mil Markgraff up with whisky, so
that he would be unable to attend the
trial. Markgraff was an important wit
ness for the plaintiff, and the admissions
of Mrs. Summers will greatly strengthen
his case. The case goes on to-day.
STREET BAILBOAD BONDS SOLD.
Los Angeles Capitalists Dispose of
Some of Their Stock in San
Francisco.
Quite a bunch of the Los Angeles street
railroad bonds change hands yesterday In
this city. George W. Baker, an attorney
acting for N. K. Hasten, a San Fran
cisco capitalist, bought one-seventh of the
bonds or the railroad company at 80 cents
on the dollar. This is a greater price than
they have ever brought before. At this
figure Masten secured $220,000 worth nt
$176,000.
The transfer was not unanimous as
two of the trustees voted against dis
posing of the bonds, but the majority
ruled, and Baker secured what he wanted
for his client.

FROM THE EAST
TO BE DUPED
Another of Mrs. Grace
Allison's Victims.
STRANDED IN A BIG CITY
PITIFUL TALE OF A GB-AY
HAIRED OLD GENTLEMAN.
He Came Here Expecting to Wed the
"Wealthy Widow," but Was
Soon Heartlessly Dis
carded.
The police are occasionally hearing from
dupes of Mrs. Grace Allison, the "wealthy
widow" of Bain's matrimonial agency,
and yesterday one of them, an old man
with white chin whiskers and wearing a
pair of gold-rimmed spectacles, called at
police headquarters and told his tale of
woe.
His name Is Alexander S. Sampson, and
he came all the way from West Duxbury.
Plymouth County, Mass., to wed the
wealthy widow. He arrived here about
six weeks ago and brought with him only
$25, tvs he expected to get married at once
to the alleged widow and live comfortably
off her wealth. She saw him, and after
learning that he was only possessed of
a smrU! ;>iece of property in West Dux
bury she discarded him. His money soon
ran out, and he had to search for work
to keep him alive.
"I joined the matrimonial agency," he
said, "last December and start*Q to cor
respond with Mrs. Allison. The letters
were few at first, but toward March they
came more frequently, and I sent her my
photograph. I asked her to send hers in
return, but she wrote me that she did
not have one, and asked me to send her
$5 to get them taken and she would send
me one. Being anxious to see how she
looked I sent her the money, but did not
receive a photograph. The letters then
dropped off again, but I finally wrote her
that I was coming to marry her. and she
replied that she and Mr. Curtis would
meet me at the Sixteenth-street station,
Oakland.
"They did not meet me, but the day af
ter my arrival I called at the agency and
three times at her house on Jones street,
later. She received me cordially at first,
but after she found out that I was not a
wealthy man she would have nothing to
do with me."
Sampson brought with him all the let
ters written to him by Mrs. Allison, and
some of them are gems. They will be
taken to the postal authorities to-day, as
there is a good case against her for us
ing the mails to obtain money by fraud.
Mrs. Allison is still in the City Prison
as a prisoner of the United States Mar
shal, and Sergeant Moflitt took the old
man to the prison to see her. She is in
a cell with some other women, and the
old man at once picked her out.
"Don't you know me?" he asked her.
"No, I don't," she snapped. "I never
saw you before, you old fool. Say, girls,
what would I do with an old guy like
that?" and the women joined In her
laugh.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Sept. 26.â action of to
day's market at the opening was disappointing
to the bulls, and stocks purchased Saturday
on tri" favorable bank statement were speedily
let go and commitments made for the short
account. The higher range of London prices
encouraged the bulls, and efforts were made
to advance prices to a parity with the Lon
don figures. The rise In the foreign market
for Union Pacific showed that foreigners were
becoming reconciled to the dividend action. |
Opening prices were Por"â hat mixed, but the j
hesitancy waa soon succeeded by a general
plunge downward under the guidance of the .
specialties. St n loss orders were uncovered in ;
the leaders, and the market for a time was at !
the mercy of the dealers who searched dili
gently for weak spots Gossip that disagree- \
ment existed between some of the speculative
pools was i lored to some extent by the sever- I
lty of the break in spots. Sugar, after a dip
downward of a point, encountered supporting
orders and ruled above Saturday's close for
the remainder of the day. The railways mean
while tell Bympathelcally, but the losses were ;
confined t" fractions, and after the first rush '
to sell had abated settled down to a level
slightly above the lowest, and resisted subse
quent efforts at depression. The firmness was !
acounted for by the publication of numerous
trnfftc statements, covering a wide area of ter
ritory and showing substantial Increases. The
elimination of an active speculative interest |
from the market owing to the rlgfd observance I
of the Hebrew holiday, Yom Klppur, reduced
business consfrt*' >
Sugar moved up to 123 and the railways ruled
the best. The market left off unsettled, with
Blight losses generally. Call money rates stiff
ened sharpl- late In the day and 5% per cent
was quoted for a time. The great bulk, how
ever, of the transactions were made at 3% per
cent, and some accommodations were secured
early in the day at 3 per cent.
The bond markr-t lacked decisive tone, but
dealings were lls,'ht and variations in either '
direction unimportant. Total sales, $1,329,000.
Government bonds were unchanged on bid
prices, but a purchase of the new fours cou- ,
pon was made at *& higher than the last sale. j

LONDON MARKETS.
NEW YORK. Sept. 26.â The Evening Post*
London financial cablegram says: To-day be
ing the eve of the settlement . and a Jewish i
holiday the stock markets here were lifeless, j
while the tone was dull on the political situa- |
tion. A recovery of the Argentines and Kaffirs
was the only exception.
Americans were dull and featureless. Union
Pacific was supported and Louisville and Nash
ville was offered.
It is reported . that a. large proportion of the I
gold withdrawn from the Bank of England for I
New York last week was not shipped, but I
cannot confirm the story- Russia and Ger
many are the only buyers of gold for the mo
ment at 77s liyÂ»d.
To-day'e slightly easier discount rate here
, was due to the action of the American money
and sterling markets.
MADRID, Sept. 26 âSpanish fours closed to- |
day at 66. Gold was quoted at 57.50.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
', CHICAGO, Sept. Wheat Bhowed consld
| erable weakness at the start. Both foreign and
domestic news was of a bearish nature. Liver- '
pool Ehowed %@l%d decline and Paris was oft
:15 centimes. Receipts .here were 312 cars, of â¢
: which 33 were of contract grade. Besides this
! about 200,000 bushels of contract wheat was re
ceived by lake and out of private houses. Min
neapolis ana Duluth reported 1663 cars, against
! 1993 last- week and 1427 a year ago. Before the
market had fairly started weakness began to
develop in cash wheat in the Northwest, which
had Its effect here. The market touched 63% c
for a moment, but selling pressure was too
much for the very moderate demand and prices
slowly sagged oil. For the first hour or so
1 nothing occurred to check the bearishness, ex
cept an indication that the visible supply state
| ment might show a decrease instead oi show
ing 1,000,000 buthels increase as expected. .Li
quidation became less urgent after that and
the market rallied to Â«3Vic. No more fluctua
tions of note occurred until' after the visible
supply statement came out. This was a sur
prise, showing a decrease of SSO.OOO bushels,
and an instant change in the tone of the mar
ket was noticed. Professional shorts and early
sellers rushed for cover and found considerable
dlfliculty in satisfying their demands. Another
I feature in the strength was rumors of heavy
I export engagements, the statement being- made
that 100 loads had been disposed of late Sat
'â â  urday night and to-day. These figures were
disputed by shippers, but had their effect
nevertheless. Primary receipts amounted to
1,792,000 bushels; amount on ocean passage in
creased 2.450.000 bushels. The market became
; very strong toward the close, trading increas
j ing greatly In volume and a substantial ad
vance in prices took place. December closed
%c higher.
Corn was slow until near the close, when It
developed considerable strength. December
closed Me higher.
Oats were dull and uninteresting until near
; the close, when. in sympathy with wheat and
corn, the market became fairly active and
firm. May closed a Bhade higher.
Provisions were fairly active. Yellow fever
i â news and liberal hog receipts were responsible
j for weakness at the opening and lower prices
i prevailed for some time. Demand from pack
ers and shorts l<ecame fairly heavy later, and,
offerings falling off, prices advanced rapidly.
January pork closed 15c higher. January lard
7%c higher and January ribs 7%c higher.

DRIED FRUITS, . UTS, RAISINS, ETC.
The New York Commercial says, under dftte
of September 20: "There Is some increase In
activity in California raisins, due to the an
nounced purpose of the association to advance
prices Â»4c after October S. Supplies for Sep
tember shipment are exhausted, and most buy
ers are purchasing for October, but no rates
are possible beyond October 8. The association
has said that rates would probably go up at
that time, and unleaa the declaration Is modi
fled, purchases for October will be compara
tively small until after the change. It was
said yesterday, however, that perhaps 20 cars
had been taken for October shipment at pres~
ent figures, though the statement was uncon
firmed.
"Commission men are not entirely satisfied
with their treatment by the association, but
few care to express their views openly. They
feel, however, that too .much uncertainty has
prevailed, and even now they do not know
whether the association will advance prices
or not. The latest Information Is that If tht
officers think best prices will be advanct-d.
But that Is too Indefinite to Insure steady busi
ness or satisfactory dealing in any form.
"There Is nothing; new In prunes. Prices are
unchanged, and trade Inclined to be moderate.
Demand is , largely confined to large sizes, of
which there are none â¢ procurable. Medium
sizes are all the trade can get, and there Is
no prospect of any change in the situation.
Futures attract little Interest, even In the face
of short crop reports, which are being con
firmed dally."
The local market Is quiet and unchanged.

FRIENDS DO
NOT BELIEVE
IN SUICIDE
Gregoire's Death Yet
a Mystery.
STORY OF A VOLUNTEER
HEARD ANGRY WORDS PRIOR
TO THE SHOOTING.
The Position of the Gun Suggests
That the Deceased Did Not
Use It on Him
self.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Sept. 26.
Friends of Cleophas Gregoire are nof at
all satisfied that he committed suicide.
The evidenoe placed before the Coroner's
Jury did not succeed in convincing that
body that Cleophas Gregoire died by his
own hand, and there are many circum
stances which indicate that he may have
been murdered.
Captain Anderson, of the Volunteers of
America, gave testimony which needs
some explanation, and the police should
certainly make an effort to discover the
man with whom Gregoire was quarreling
just twenty minutes before he came to
his death in such a mysterious manner.
Captain Anderson testified as follows:
"I left the Methodist church about ten
minutes to 10 o'clock with my wife and
her sister, who lives on Twenty-second
street. We walked down to Twenty-sec
ond street, and at the corner of Twenty
second and Grove we stopped and talked
as my wife's eister had only a block to
go .we went no further with her. On the
corner there stood two men talking. They
did not seem to agree. I paid particular
attention to them, and on the other side
there stood another man; he stood still
there. I turned and looked back at these
men that were talking there, and as I
looked at them they walked up toward
San Pablo and Grove. We talked there I
guess for ten minutes. When we came
back again, I and my wife, I noticed this
man that Is down In the Morgue now
was standing on the corner of San Pablo
avenue and Hobart street talking to a
man that was not so tall as this man
On the other side the same man was
standing across the street that was
standing down on Twenty-second street
I positively identify this man lying in the
Morgue as being one of those men. They
were talking about a contract. But the
car came along and made a noise and I
did not hear all the conversation. It oc
curred to me that it was a pretty dan
gerous place, people standing on the cor
ner talking like this, and I went on "
In response to the question "Who -was
this third man that you have described as
f-tanding off to one side?" the witness
answered: "He was standing on the other
side of the street. He had an overcoat
on. I could see that across the street
when the car passed." The witness went
on to describe the clothing -of the men
and the angry manner In which they were
talking.
"Did you notice the attitude of this de- i
ceased man?," was BJÂ»ked- the w!tnw.Â«.--
"Yes; the other man was talking to 'â 
this man of something that this other!
man wanted of this man (the deceased)
or something that he wanted him to con
sent to. That is what It seemed as I !
passed by."
There Is also much curiosity expressed
as to how, presuming Gregoire committed
suicide, the pistol should be found under
his shoulder while his hands were at his
side. The general experience of police
officers has been that when a man com
mits suicide the pistol is either close by
his hand or firmly clutched within the
lingers. Officer Swain testified that he
found the pistol underneath the deceased
between his right elbow and. shoulder.
The testimony of Mr. Remlllard showed
that during the day the deceased was
making all possible arrangements to
leave for Canada, and no evidence has
yet besn brought forward to suggest a
reason for suicide, â 
Some surprise has been expressed that
Dr. Perkins, who was the man who dis
covered the dead body of . Gregoire on the
grass, was not called at the inquest. In
describing the manner in which he found
Gregoire to a reporter Dr. Perkins said,
"Most decidedly this is not a case of sui
cide." â¢
MORE DELAY FOR
THE COUNTY BRIDGE
WAB DEPARTMENT HAS NO
DESIRE FOR HURRY.
Bids Will Not Be Called for Until All
Objections Are Re
moved.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, I
908 Broadway, Sept. 26.
The county bridge, which should have
been completed across the estuary a
month ago, and which has not yet been
commenced, was the subject of discussion
before the Supervisors this morning.
County Clerk Jordan read a telegram
from the Secretary of War stating that
the Southern Pacific Company was
â¢ granted sixty dayÃ' extension from Au
gust 1 for â¢ completing. Harrison-street
bridge and removing Alice-street bridge.
It also stated that if the company, would
apply for a further extension of four
months, from October 1, such application
would "be favorably considered.
Supervisor Roeth reported that he had
telegraphed the railroad company and
had been informed that It made applica
tion through its New York office.
Roeth asked ' why the resolution intro
duced by him several weeks ago, directing
the District Attorney and Clerk to adver
tise for bids for the new county bridge
at Webster street, had been sidetracked.
It was discovered from the minutes that
Mr. Roeth's resolution directed that an
advertisement be prepared and be placed
In the hands of the board. This, It ap
pears, has been done and the bridge bids
will be advertised for as soon as the
plans and other details are ready.

PUGS CROSS THE COUNTY LINE.
A Carload of San Francisco Boughs
Enter ban Mateo to Fight.
A sufficient number of San Francisco
roughs to fill an electric car of the San
Francisco and San Mateo line left this
city last night about 9 o'clock and crossed
the county line into San Mateo, where
they indulged in a prize fight with bare
knuckles.
The news of their departure from San
Francisco came in by the way of Ocean
View over the telephone wire with but
meager information, stating that "Kid"
Johnston and a man named McMahon
had been matched to fight ten rounds
Following this set-to Edward Prender
gast of Ocean View was to face a New
York bruiser named Collins in a like
number of rounds. The motive which
prompted these fights is said to be the
settlement of some old grudges existing
between the quartet. The exact place
where the mill came off was carefully
kept secret, fearing the information
might reach the Sheriff of San Mateo
County.
The San Francisco police had been
posted on the movements of the roughs,
but their jurisdiction ended at the county
line and it was too late to telegraph the
Sheriff of the adjoining county in time
to Btop the fight.
AMONG THE PUGILISTS.
Fistic Entertainments That Will Be
Given by the Email -'ry Bjx
ing Clubs.
The California Athletic and Swimming
Club will give a fistic entertainment this
evening. The feature of the sport will be
an eight-round contest between Henry

Ely and June Dennis and John McMahon.
The Excelsior Athletic Club will give
some contests in Woodward's Pavilion
Friday evening. The event of importance
will be a twenty round go between Joe
Kennedy and Jack Stelzner.
EIGHT HARD ROUNDS.
Eugene Mulligan Won a Decision
From the vlame Charley John-
son on Points.
ThÂ« Alpine Athletic Club gave its
monthly entertainment last evening, and
a crowded house nleased the managers.
The two events that ushered in the
event of the evening could not be consid
ered appetizers, as they were, so to speak,
as tame as church mice. In fact, the ser
geant of police in attendance was serious
ly inclined to stop the alleged boxing, as
the spectators were suffering an intense
tired feeling.
The feature of the evening, however,
made up for the opening events. It was
an eight-round contest between the game
and willing auburn-haired pugilist Eugene
Mulligan of the Merchants' Athletic Club
and Charles Johnson of the California
Athletic and Swimming Club. The bout
was thoroughly Interesting, as the con
testants fought every inch of ground from
start to finish, and in the last round the
contest was of such a spirited nature that
every spoft present was on his leet and
shouting for his favorite.
In the opening round Mulligan scored a
lead until near the finish, when Johnson
opened his dog's of war* and landi-d a few
heavy right-handers on "Mull's" chin
which partially dazed the recipient.
The second ended with honors even. In
the third , MulliKan landed four hard
rights on Johnson's left ear and two body
blows, which were very effective. This
was Mulligan's round beyond question.
The fourth was replete with hard
smashes, both men landing blow for blow.
Johnson retired to his corner looking very
red In the face. Johnson had a shade the
best of the fifth.
The sixth was Mulligan's on points, as
he repeatedly ducked very cleverly under
Johnson's right-hand jabs and time and
again he put his right on Johnson's ear.
According to Queensberry rules a clever
duck scores in favor of the ducker and
against the man who falls to land. This
is something which referees seldom take
into consideration.
The seventh round also ended in favor
of Mulligan on points, as Johnson seem
ingly relied solely on his good right to
put Mulligan out, but repeatedly failed
to land. Had he used his left on "straight
leads and then placed his right on the jaw
when a favorable opportunity presented
a different result might have been an
nounced.
The eighth terminated slightly In favor
of Johnson, who had the better staving
qualities and fought like a demon. Both
men were very groggy when the gong
sounded for the end of hostilities. Pos
sibly if the contest had lasted ten rounds
Johnson would have won, as he evidently
had the better staying qualities.
St. Patrick's Sazaar.
The entertainment and reception com
mittees of St. Patrick's Bazaar held an
enthusiastic meeting last evening and ar
ranged a programme for each evening of
the present week. On Wednesday night
the fair will be opened. Governor Budd
will make a speech. The San Francisco
Quartet will sing. St. Patrick's orchestra
will play during the entire evening. The
Children of Mary booth, Mrs. T. D. Sul
livan presiding, will give a musical and
literary entertainment Thursday night.
Friday evening Leo XIII booth. Miss
Doran, president, will entertain the visi
tors to the fair. St. Ignatius booth, pre
sided over by Miss Dhue, will present an
elaborate programme Saturday night.
The literary booth has decided to issue a
dally journal, styled St. Patrick's Bazaar
Bulletin, during the fair.
Mrs. 11. J. Hanchette Dead.
Mrs. Emma A. Hanchette, a school
teacher of Los Angeles, died at the Lane
Hospital yesterday forenoon from the re-
Bult of a surgical operation.
The death of Mrs. Hanchette recalls the
mysterious disappearance of her husband,
Harry Jay Hanchette, about ten years
ago, since â which time he has never been
heard from. At the time of his dlsap
pearanoe he left this city to go to Los
Angeles, where everything was then
booming. From that day to the present
he has never been seen by any one who
knew him.
Wolf No Longer Executor.
John Wolf, the missing member of the
Wolf-Wreden Company, was removed as.
the executor of the estate of Sarah M.
Pearson by Judge Troutt yesterday, jjt
is charged that Wolf is short in his ac
counts as executor of the estate and that
such shortage is responsible for his dis
appearance.

"THE SEVENTH
MAY YET GO
TO MANILA"
General Merriam Has
So Stated.
TRANSPORTS NOW EXPECTED
THE ORDER OF DEPARTURE
NOT YET DETERMINED.
Colonel Smith of the Tennessee Regi
ment Tunis Over the Money
for the Thomas Fam
ily's Damages. .
, "There Is yet a possibility that the Sev
enth California Regiment may go to Ma
nila." . . â¢ . â¢
The above statement was made yester
day afternoon by Major General Merrlam
at department headquarters: - Beyond
this the general would not discuss the
matter or give out anything for publica
tion, but ho intimated that he had re
ceived news from Washington that
showed that the mustering out of the
Seventh may be ordered stopped. at any
moment, and in fact it is believed that
the orders have been received and will
be communicated to Captain Pratt to-day.
Late yesterday afternoon, when Cap
tain Pratt closed his office for. the day
and left for his honie at Fort Mason, he
declared that he had received no orders
to cease mustering put the. regiment, but
he stated that as a result of what he had
seen in the papers he had stopped giving
any of the men their discharges. The
captain- said that he had. found .the regi
ment in excellent shape' and that there
was no better In- the service. . As far as
Captain Pratt's work is concerned' he will
have, the regiment ready to go to Los An
geles to-morrow.
The transports are daily expected to be
gin arriving here. The Senator should
get here this week for a certainty, and
there may be two more vessels in. If It
is found that they do not have to go into
Urydock, then the llrst of â  the cle-tach
rm-nts of the troops may get away In
about two weeks' time. Quartermaster
Thompson had an interview with General
Merrlam, In which in>- latter stated that
the men must be supplied with ponchos
as they, had been found more service
able. than overcoats, for the latter had
proven of no use to the troops in the
warm climate. As to the order in which
the troops will leave no one at present
knows anything. It is probable that Gen
eral .Merrlam will ask General Miller for
his recommendations or he may turn the
whole matter over to him, which is more
probalile. â¢ . â¢
Private Ham- E. Goodrich. Company
M. Seventh California Regiment, died at
the Division Hospital late on Sunday
night of typhoid fever.
Colonel Smith of the Tennessee Regi
ment yesterday turned over to Assistant
Adjutant General Woodward, of General
Millers staff, the money for the dam
age done the property of Zero Thomas
by the soldiers of his regiment. This
money will bo given to Thomas to-mor
row. This- formally closes the affair
Lieutenant Alfred Aloe of the Eigh
teenth Infantry has been temporarily at
tached to the Third Battalion of the
Twenty T third Infantry.
WANT TO GO HOME.
Soldiers of the Seventh Do Not
Want to Remain in the
Service:
It being almost a certainty that or
ders have been received here at depart
ment headquarters for the .retaining in
the service, of the Seventh Regiment, the
men of the organization have given ex
pression to their feelings in the matter.
They want to be mustered out. At least
50 per cent of them declare themselves as
anxious to leave the service.
When it became known yesterday that j
there was a possibility that the -regiment !
would not be â¢ mustered out, several of !
the companies held meetings and ap- |
pointed committees, who were instructed
to invoke the influence of their friends
and the press in having the regiment got-
ten out of the service as soon as possi
ble. The men declare that they do not
tvant to do garrison duty, and they bring
up the charge against their offirtM-s that
they have been working on General Mer- |
riam since his return to have the regi- I
ment retained simply because they want I
to continue to draw the salaries that !
they are getting now. Company B was
one of the companies- that appointed a
committee, and the members of it de
clare that positively 80 per cent of the
men want to get home and out of tho
service' at once. They say that even if.
they are the first to be sent to Manila
they still desire to leave the service.
They intend to use even* Influence in
jhelr power to be mustf-red out if it should
happen that orders have been received to
retain the regiment in service.
ARMY SUPPLY DEPOT.
The Largest ' West of Phila-
delphia Is Likely to Be
Established Here.
There are bright prospects that San
Francisco will have the largest depot for
&rmy supplies west of Philadelphia. The
quarters for supplies have already been
swelled by the addition of the old Ex
iminer building on Mission street. This
was secured for the purpose of storing
the arms, equipments, etc., released by
the Sixth and Seventh California regi
ments when mustered out.
Colonel Long, speaking of the matter at
the quartermaster's department yester
jlay, said: "I have no doubt that the
large increase to be made in- the forces
now stationed at various points in the
Pacific will cause a corresponding in
rrease in the capactlty of the army store
nouses in t...s city. It is very probable
that the department has under contem
plation the establishing of a very large
3epot for supplies in San Francisco. Thus
far I have received nothing official in the
matter."
It has been said that the building now
sccupied by Wells, Fargo & Co. will be
Utilized as soon as the company moves
to their new location.

McLAUGHLIN
AGAIN KING
OF MARKSMEN
Will Rule a Second
Year at the Butts.
AUTUMN SHOOT IS ENDED
CALIFORNIA SCHUETZEN CLUB
BUILDS BIG SCORES.
The Final Festivities of the Great
est Shoot in Years Will Be
Held on bun
day.
Again will D. W. Mclaughlin be
crowned king of marksmen. For a year
he has reigned, and for the year to come
will the crack of his rifle emphasize hj s
claim to leadership of those who, of a fair
Sunday, go into the California Schuetzen
Club's range to burn powder and pile up
scores.
â¢ King McLaughliri's second claim to sov
ereignty was made good yesterday after
noon, when, at the end of the club's au-
McLaughlin.the New Shooting King.
tumnal shoot, it was announced that his
score was best of the spven marksmen
who entered in the king's tourney. For a
good half hour the racket of rifles was
quieted, and the popping of champagne
corks, that had only the celling for a
target, gave the noisy eclat that Is char
acteristic of all Schuetzen meets. It was
a gala Ume, this fending ot the king, and
only Philo Jacoby's enforced absence
dimmed the ardor r>f it.
Outside the king list, D. B. Faktor cap
tured first honors and will take all of the
numerous first prizes as his reward of
merit. Following him, so closely that
only the "second best shot" made the
difference, came Captain F. B. Schuster,
John I'tschig Sr. and L. C. Babin, all
pioneers of the California's range,- and all
of them medal holders for past achieve
ment.
The first and last bullsoyc-s of the morn
ing went to Captain -Frt'd Kuhls and L.
C. Babin'; the first and last of the after
noon to L. C. Rabin and D. B. Faktor.
The close of the shoot by no means
. marks finale at the end of the season's
festivity. There are the prizf-s vet to be
presented to their winners, and for the
jolly ceremony that always attends upon
the presentation Sunday is the day set.
Captain Fred' W. Schumann is arranging
for the event, which will be held at the
park, near San Rafael.
â¢ The morning will be given over to work
in the ranges and picnicking through the
grounds; lunch at noon and. the exercises
in the pavilion after it. The pretty cere-,
mony of the annual passing o. the" loving
cup will follow the distribution of the
prizes, and it is counted no small honor
to drink from that same loving cup for it
is the only idol that good Schuetzens bow
down to, and most r>f those of the old
Centennial team, who .by their prowess
brought i.t back from Philadelphia in 1876
Will be at hand to have their sip.

A DEATH-BED MARRIAGE.
Suit was filed yesterday by Malvlna De
visnes to set aside a decree of distribu
tion in the estate of Henri Devisnes,
who died November 27, 1896. The plain
tiff alleges that she is the widow of the
deceased, having married him in FrancÂ©
In June of ISSO. In consequence she de
mands distribution to her of the entire
estate.
The complaint is directed against the
estate of Vlctorine Augustine Devisnes,
to whom the estate of the deceased was
bequeathed. It is averred that Mrs. Vic
torine Devisnes was formerly Vlctorinfe
Augustine Estennvin. and that she wed
ded Devisnes under that name while he
was on his dfathbed, well knowing that
the dying man had a wife living. The
plaintiff holds that she is entitled to the
estate, which is valued at $2175, and asks
judgment accordingly.
Nicaraguan Canal Congress.
Since the proposition to hold a Nicara
guan canal congress was llrst suggested
the greatest of Interest has been mani
fest by people from all parts of the coun
try. This congress is to be held in Chi
cago on November 15. 16 and 17. Its pur
pose Is to secure favorable legislation for
the big waterway between the two oceans
and for its construction, operation and
control by the United States. The call
for this meeting was made by a combina
tion of the Chicago and San Â£>iego Cham
bers of Commerce and the American
Nicaraguan Canal Association. Invita
tions were sent to the President of tue
I nlted States, and State, county and mu
nicipal officers, and to the presidents of
all commercial bodies, to send representa
tives. None of these bodies have been
more interested in the project than the
local Chamber of Commerce. Now comes
Santa Barbara, one of Its influential citi
zens writing to Secretary Scott that tne
people of that county are becoming In

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 1898.
THE FRAWLEYS
IN COSTUME
Miss Bates Scores in "An
Enemy to the King."
THE O'NEIL'S PARTHENIA
"ROMEO AND JULIET" GIVEN
AGAIN AT THE TIVOLI.
Alcazar's "In Mizzoura" â Morosco's
"Trilby"â Orpheum ana Al
liambva Variety â Con
tinuation of "Jones."
Mr. Frawley and his company dared the
superstitions last night by moving over
the way to the Baldwin. Superstition, or,
rather, the superstitious defiance of ordin
ary superstition, has had a lot to do wka
the success of this companyâ at least so
the press agent would have us believe.
When the Frawleys first came to San
Francisco and opened at the Columbia
the press agent had worlds of fun and ad
vertising out of Mr. Frawley's dare-devil
fondness for the number "thirteen." On
the opening night there were thirteen ac
tors in the cast, thirteen lights in the lod
by, thirteen precious stones In Mr. Fried
lander's shirt toilet, and who remem
bers what other mystic combinations!
And the season began promptly on the
thirteenth of the month. Mr. Frawley, I
have, read somewhere, didn't want to
change his theater this time, but the Co
lumbia bookings were full, and the Fraw
leys were needed to make out the Baldwin
season, so he was "Induced," and Miss
Blanche Bates, the flower of the old band,
was borrowed from Augustin Daly to help
along the occasion. And as many of the
old superstitions as possible were put in
force too. In fact, the fhirteens were
doubled on, and last night saw twenty
six actors in the cast and an opening on
the twenty-sixth of the month.
The piece was "An Enemy to the King,"
a costumed romance by R. N. Stephens, ,'
that was made successful in New York !
by E. H. Sothern's work in the leading
! part. You have read before now of Mr.
Frawley's loss of a loading man. It was
owing to that disaster that he appeared
last night in the role made famous by I
Mr. Sothern. Any one that has studied
Mr. Sothern and Mr. Frawley will admit
that their methods and personalities are
| somewhat different. To me it is even
I strange that they should have an occu
pation in common. But Mr. Frawley
will act; and last nigfrt as Ernanton de
Launay, the Hugeonot â¢hero of Mr. Ste
phen's romance, he acted for his life, one
might say. Mr. Frawley's acting is of
known color and quality, and it never
changes. In a certain line of comically
stiffened parts, like say the fcstina lente
officer in "The Senator," he is as much j
as admirable and delightfully funny. In \
parts of heroic character he is perhaps j
Just as funny but not so admirable. So
there is no need to describe his effort of j
last night. He was Mr. Frawleyâ that
and nothing else in the world.
But for all Mr. Frawley's unconvlction
as a serious character there is something
in the man himself that is earnest and
good-natured and makes friends in the
audience; and this quality, whatever it
may be, helped him better than ever last
night. He was recalled at the close of
the excellent third act, and made an hon
est little speech, straight from the heart,
in which he said that short of the small
pox the Frawley Company had suffered
every epidemic in nature this season;
that it was due more to some belated
i and inexplicable piece of luck than to
| good management that we found its rem
j nants here at all, that he had taken this
I his first costume part in an emergency
and at the last moment, that he hardly
i knew the lines, and feared he wronged
| the author, but that he thanked us and
i hoped to do better later in the week.
It was a genuine little talk, and cheered
us all up an<l covered a multitude of
artistic sins.
The entfre company seemed more, or less
nervous, but nevertheless the play was
given a successful trying out and the
j prospect is a performance with several
i examples of good acting within a night or
I two. Already Miss Bates has mastered
i her part of Julie de Vernon. It is not
i the best she has ever done, but it is fine.
| distinguished work, never overdrawn and
i always warm and fragrant with woman
liness. She was cheered and flowered at
the end of the first act until the real
I tears were in her eyes. She came down
!to the lights and said: "All I can say
I Is that 1 thank you from the bottom of
1 my heart for this kind welcome horne â
. for It is home, although it isn't the Col
umbia Theater." And everybody was sin
' cerely glad to have her back again. It is
I no longer mere provincial pride to reckon
j Blanche Bates among the foremost ac
1 tresses of America.
Sam Edwards as the serio-comic hench
! man of the Huguenot hero was consplcu
i ous among the others of the cast that
i did well; Mr. Roberts was proud and
, splendid as the Catholic Governor; Joseph
i P. Keeefe celebrated hie first appearance
with the company by a very plausible
i soldier of fortune, and G. Foster Platt
| was fairly the same in a similar part.
' Miss Georgia Wells hadn't very much to
i do as the innkeeper's daughter, but did it
I nicely enough. The same for Miss Elea
| nor Carey as the Innkeeper's wife.
As to the play itself it fs a costume
drama (a type not to be taken too serious-
I ly) with a really beautiful third act. It
ris no more like a comic opera than most
j of its kind; maybe not so much. It is pic
! torial to a degree, not riotously florid in
; the speeches, and not overloaded with
"situations." In motive it is the same as
\ "I'nder the Red Robe"â only this time it
lis a woman, not a man, whose "honor
j rooted in dishonor stood." The life of
' Julie's father is at stake for having
sheltered Huguenots, and the price she
â  must pay to save it Is to decoy a young
! Huguenot captain into the hands of his
i enemies. He saves her from Insult in the
i first act, and tries vigorously to give up
his life to save her again in the third. And
she does about what Gil de Berault would
ido in similar circumstances. There is a
plenty of high words and tall fighting and
considerable pictorial charm; and. as I said
[ earlier, the third act is beautiful. In It
sentiment and heroics are skillfully
blended, and the action is lithe and tell
ing. This is the sun-dial act that you see
Pictured on the posters, and it deserves its
ume. The scenery Is well-meant and
i lively to look at, and the Frawleys quite
: credible In their sixteenth-century
i clothes. ASHTON STEVENS.
Columbia.
The week began at the Columbia with the
I Greek love idyl "Ingomar, the Barbarian."
I ami Nance O'Neill In a decollete Del Sarte
j role with Edwin Forrest trimmings. Although
i suffering from hoarseness Miss O'Neill acted
| the trying part In a manner which gained for
I her the sympathy of her audience. The Greek
! dress gave her ample opportunity to display a
! line pair of arms and a bust fair enough to
! satisfy a sculptor, while her lines calling for
i tenderness and maidenly devotion were spoken
! for the most part In the fair-weather way
| called for by the spirit of the play. Here, It
must be said. Miss O'Neill was at her best.
I the fault of overdoing so conspicuous In her
acting In other plays being absent In this. At
times there was a little staglness In the effect,
a touch of elocution on stilts, but those times
were not fre<juent enough to mar the effect
of an otherwise good performance.
Herbert Carr made a stalwart enough Ingo
mar and delivered the rounded periods and
faultless rhetoric of the barbarian with a fine
voice, a splendid pair of legs and a magnificent
physique aiding In establishing him as a fa
vorite with more ladies than Parthenia. L.
W'r>od as Father Myron was funny In his ear
nestness and Mr. Weaver as Polvdor was re
pulsive enough in action and make-up to suit
the most exacting of gallery gods, or Greek
gods for the matter of that. "Ingomar" will
be repeated this evening, to-morrow evening
and at the Saturday matinee.
The Alcazar:
"In Mlxzoura" opened at the Alcazar Theater
last evei.iig for the first time in this city a*
po|)ulnr prices. It was a success In every par
ticular, staging, cast and execution. The
scenery was from the brush of Edward Will
iams and was so true to life, Missouri life
that even the old split rail fence appears to ex
tend for a mile up the turnpike road. Those
nho have seen "In Mlizoura" will remember
the plot, of how the old blacksmith's pretty
Bemlnary educated daughter falls in love with
a polished train robber and casts aside the
love of a rough but true friend, the County
Bheriff, who. through his regard for the girl,
allows the fellow to escape, only to meet his
death In another county. The. part of the old
blacksmith, Joe Vernon, was taken by George
Osbourne, who showed that he comprehended
the finer parts of his work. Gretchen Lyons
made a very pretty Kate Vernon and though
taking a leading part, she was obliged to share
the honors with her "Sister 'Lizabeth" Ver
non, Joe's youngest daughter, 'inls difficult
part was assumed by Miss Maybell Bowman,
a girl scarce! j- 15 years of age.
Seven years ago the child made her debut
on the Alcazar stage in some small part. Last
evening she received an ovation that many
an older actress would have highly appre
ciated. At the end of the first act, after a
wreath of beautiful floral offerings had been
presented to her, the audience called loudly
time and again for the little miss and would
not be satisfied until she appeared before them
"all by her lonely." The requirements of her
part make it necessary that the actress should
be green, raw, awkwardâ in fact, a typical lit
tle Piker. Mlsa Bowman was all of these. She
is a whole show in herself in this class of
work.
Ernest Hastings, as "Jim" Radburn, the
Sheriff, was well appreciated. He understands
and acts the part well. Clarence Montaine
as Dave, the blacksmith's helper, made much
laughter by his awkwardness and comical ap
pearance. Howard Scott made a good rascal
in the person of Robert Travers. Miss Marie
Howe as Joe's wife delineates the character
as though she had been born and "riz" in
Missouri. The others were acceptable.
The Orpheum.
The Orpheum'B new bill is fully up to the
standard. Of the four new acts there is not a
weak one in the lot. The clever little comedy
"The Man Up Btairs" was presented by Mr.
and Mrs. R. J. Dustan, and all the parts were
ably handled. As the Irish servant girl Miss
Maggie Weston was exceedingly funny. In fact
her Irishisms and mishaps tended to divert
attention from the more delicate comedy work
of Mr. and Mrs. Dustln, who In their way may
be classed among the best that have appeared
on the Orpheum stage. Lew Hawkins was a
favorite from the start. He returns with a lot
of new material which he delivers in catching
style
The Anglo-American quartet in a military
sketch entitled "In Camp" introduce some
gongs that are well received. Sankey Brothers
class as Al acrobats. They perform all their
work with an ease and finish that gives them
place among the very best. Their balancing
is particularly clever. Louis Cazeau In some
new feats of magic. Mile. Franko the vtolln
lste. Bessie Bonehlll, the two Paolis and dog
and the blogranh with new views round out
one of the Orpheum'B best bills.
Grand Opera- House,
"Trilby" as presented at the Grand Opera
house last night could not be called a success.
The stock company, although reinforced, did
not rise equal to the occasion, with the excep
tion of Leslie Morosco as Zoo Zoo and Lorena
Atwood as Trilby, who gave an artistic inter
pretation of their parts. James M. Brophy
made hie reappearance in "his own conception"
of Svengali, but he cannot be congratulated on
the result as it is not by any means an im
provement upon the conceptions of Wilton
Lackaye, Theodore Roberts or Frederick
Pauldlng.
The Alhambra.
Nat M. Brigham, the American ballad tenor,
was the principal new attraction at the Al
hnmbra last night. He has a clear resonant
voice, and enunciates well, but there is not
much expression in his singing. He took well
with the audience, and was encore.l three times.
Mr. and Mrs. Sydney iJrew in "Diana on the
Chase" made the hit of the evening. The
Austin sisters in their aerial acts were partic
ularly good, and Corlnne as usual captured
everybody hy her singing and playing on the
mandolin. The Alhambra has a good pro
gramme this week.
The Tivoll.
Gounod's lyrical masterpiece attracted a good
audience to the Tivoll last night. It seems to
me that there Is hardly another opera In which
the. character and the sentimentality of the
composer Is better reflected. Gounod's mar
velously composed music stands upon a pure
and platonic plane. Like Chopin, Grieg. Wajr
ner and perhaps Salnt-Saens, he sets his Indi
vidual seal upon his work in a way that can
scarcely be. mistaken. But Gounod, as an ex
ponent of pure music, untlngedâ l will not say
tainted â by mundane considerations, seemed to
swim aloft with the eternals, ajid to view mere
human praise or blame with the fine indiffer
ence of Olympian Jove.
The performance was given in excellent style.
It' is almost bordering on over-criticism to
point to fault at all, but if one may be hinted
at it is that the conception of Signor Zerni is
entirely in the one key of indifference. How
ever, his rendering of the beautiful duo won
him well deserved applause. Miss Lichter is
a sweet Juliet. She shows " this charming
flower of girlhood as It ought to be shown, and
she certainly has studied this congenial role
with dauntless zeal. Nothing more Impressive
has ever been shown at the Tlvoll than the fa
mous balcony scene. Miss Llchter â¢ has ; very
mobile features. This Is. the perfection of real
art, where it is not always the voice alone and
where acting has its due weight and Its proper
share. - Her -attitudes -suggest thought and In
the Intensity .of their, conviction the eyes
Inferred an : atmosphere which by no great
stretch of the Imagination recalled the aureole
of the painter. 1 '
The breezy Mr. Pruette helped very much
to make this opera a success. Would â â¢ that
space permitted me to give a more detailed ac
count of each artist's talented performance,
but I will not fall to praise the splendid work
of the chorus. "Romeo and Juliet" was cer
tainly a success. _21 G. H. MORRE.
Chutes Theater.
Pletro Marino, who graduated at the Brussels
Conservatory of Music last year, and who was
Tsaye's pride and favorite pupil, played at the
Chutes Free Theater last evening and scored a
hit. After popular and classical selections he
gave the intermezzo from "Cavalleria Rusti
cana," and was even then compelled to respond
to another encore. The rest of the bill is un
usually good.
Olympia.
At the Olympia Music Hall last night Lillian
Monteray, a descriptive singer, received several
recalls and Nadine Allen, the chic soubrette,
made a great hit. Kelly and Vlolette can be
classed as among the best. Madeline, the con
tortion dancer, Martin's dogs and some five or
six other acts round out a good variety bill.
Lely's Song Recital.
An artistic and unique pong recital was given
in Sherman &â¢ Clay Hull last night by Durward
Lely. who used to be Pattl's tenor. Mr. Lely's
selections ranged from Schubert to Sullivan,
and he snng all the songs with charming dis
cretion and taste, bringing out the full strength
of the text as well as the muÃic. Mrs. Lely
accompanied and played a Beethoven sonata
and a Schubert Impromptu. A second recital
will be given to-night. and another on Saturday
night in the Fame hall.
New Comedy.
Harry Corson Clarke and his bright little
company will continue all of this week at the
New Comedy Theater in "What Happened to
Jones." There will be a special profession!! !
matinee Wednesday and a souvenir matinee
Saturday. At the latter Mr. Clarke will hold
a reception on the stage and present to every
lady present a real fan. Miss Lillian Young
will appear Thursday night In the curtain
raiser, "One Touch of Nature," alternating
the balance of the week 'with Miss Olive Snider.
BOTTLEMEIR'S CONCERT HALL, reopened

OUT FOB A LARK.
Jennie Wallace Arrested for Mas-
querading in a Soldier's Uniform.
Jennie Wallace, a handsome young
woman, was arrested by Officer Sylvester
at an early hour yesterday morning while
entering 211 O'Farrell street, for masquer
ading in male attire.
Jennie Is a friend of some of the Ten
nessee soldiers, and several of them
called on her Sunday night. For a lark
she was Induced to don the uniform' of
Private E. M. Higgins of Company A,
and, accompanied by three soldiers, she
went to a restaurant on Eddy street to
have supper, Hlggins being left behind,
as he did not care to rig himself out in
Jennie's clothes.
They were returning from supper when
Sylvester thought there was something
unusual in Jennie's carriage for a man,
and as they were entering the house he
stopped them and Jennie admitted her
sex. She was at once placed under ar
rest.
Friends brought her clothes to the pris
on yesterday morning and Hlggins' uni
form was placed in charge of the prop
erty clerk. When the case was called In
Judge Low's court Higgins' predicament
was explained to the Judge, and he made
an order on the property clerk for the
delivery of the uniform to Hlggins' com
panions, and continued the hearing of the
charge against Jennie until this morn
ing.

ARTISTS ARE
ROWING WITH
ONE ANOTHER
Woman's Ingratitude
to Woman.
IT'S THE SAME OLD KICKERS
ALL WANT THEIR PICTURES
HUNG ON THE LINE.
Secretary Martin Does Not Consider
Studio Teas a Drawback to
the Institute Ex
hibition.
Artists are rowing: with one another.
The. regular fall exhibition of the Art In
stitute opens on' October 13, ana ievery
where that the. knights of the brush meet
protests are heard and veiled flings at the
"jury of acceptance or rejection" are mer
rily tossed to and fro.
The ladles also have chosen to take part
In the general dissatisfaction, and after
noon studio teas are given for the sole
ana only purpose .of discussing whether
:lt is possible for a woman â on a hang
ing committeeâto act fairly and squarely
toward another voman.
The dissension in the ranks of art is not
a' matter of a day nor a week. Those in
terested in. the fight claim it is the natural
outcome of many years of autocratic op
pression, of worthy pictures of unknown
struggling artists relegated to the "sky"
and above all to the bugaboo of all art
istsâbad light; Favorite pupils, so thÂ«
grumblers claim, find their pictures on the
line, while the .outsider has his picturo
hung in some obseuro or out-of-the-way
place. . â 
The especial "kick" of the lady exhlolt
ors this year is that Mrs. jdce B. Chitten
den Is on .the hanging committee and a
woman, they claim, is never, can never
end will never be just to another woman.
There .is also sunie talk that October is
too early for a profitable resulting exhibi
tion, and that nearer Christmas time
might find more purchasers. The dissat
isfied ones, moreover, hold that the studio
tea and exhibition give the artist in every
way a better chance, both as to showing
and disposing of his work.
Up at the institute they only laugh at
all the reports of dissatisfaction, and Sec
retary Martin sums up the authors of all
the charges under the head of "kickers."
"It la the kickers," said Martin.
"Every exhibition brings piem out with a
long string of grievances, a dr-nunciation
of the institute and a determination not
to exhibit. Hut they all calm down, send
In their pictures, are delighted to have
them accepted and hung as best the com
mittee sees flt. â¢
"All cannot be hung on the line, and all
cannot have just the light that each art
ist demands. God's own sunlight cannot
1 c t'-mpered to please some exhibitors.
for they naturally must be dissatisfied.
l!i;rn kickers, that's the whole thing."
The charge against Mrs. Chittenden is
scorned by the g*-nial secretary.
"Mrs. Chittenden is justice personified,
and bo gentleâ why, she would not harm a
By." â¢ .
â  Martin's only trouble in the midst of
nl! this turmoil is the probability that
the night class on account of its lack of
pupils will have to he discontinued.
.'1 he jury of acceptance or rejection for
this year's exhibition consists of Mrs. A
B. .Chittenden, L. P. Latimer C. C. Jud-
Joseph ilroenhaum, H. R. Bloomer,
Aaron. Aitmnn, Miss M. Froellch, G. Ca
denasso, Mrs. Sarah Gamble, Mrs. C'ara
â¢ Mrs. E. P. Bradley and Joseph
D Strong.
This jury, according to the laws of the
Institute, has selected five of its number
to art as hanging committee and they
are: Mrs. A. B. Chittenden, C. C. Jud-
Bon, L. P. Latimer, Joseph Greenbaum
and Joseph D. Strong.
members of the institute anticipate
tcellent and most creditable exhibit,
in spite- of "kicks" and the rivalry of
"studio teas."

Young Girl Found In a Lodging-
House in a Precarious Condition.
Neille'KaUy, 18 years of age, was found
alone and sick In a room In the Gerard
House, W2- Seventh street, yesterday after
noon. She was brought there a week
ago by a young man who gave his name
as Madden, and has had no attention
since that time.
Dr. Bunnell -was called In and found
she was suffering from pneumonia. Of
ficer McMurray had her removed to the
City and County Hospital.
Health Officials May Go.
There was an informal caucus of sev
eral members of the Board of Health
held last evening at the office of Dr. Wil
liamson., to discuss retrenchment in ex
penditures. The decision has been reached,
however, that If the worst comes, four
or five milk inspectors and a number of
others In the pure food department will
have to go. The appearance of Texas
fever among cattle in Solano County was
considered by the doctors Lost evening,
and at the board meeting to-night steps
will be taken to prevent the Introduction

I was suffering tortures from a diseased

over my head. I had no rest. I got a cake ol

with hot water and Ccncnu. Soap, and then
applied the Cuticcka (ointment) as a dress-

one cake of soap, to be cured. Now, my head
hasn't a pimple on it, and my hair is growing
splendidly. ADA C. HARRELL,

I was troubled with dandruff so that it made
my hair fall out bo bad, I got discouraged. I
purchased a box of Cutictra (ointment; and a
cake of Ccticcra Soap. The former I rubbed
well into the scalp twice a week, and then
shampooed with warm water and agood lather
of Ci'tiocra Soap once a week. My hair is
growing out thick once more, and free from
terrible dandruff. Miss ADA JAYE3,

KEROSENE SUFFICIENT TO
BLOW UP A WHOLE BLOCK
Astounding Case of Arson in the Mission â Mrs. Margaret Shields Wanted by
the Police for the Supposed Commission of the Crime â The Furniture
Had Been Removed in the Night and Fire Started in Two Places.
ONE of the clumsiest cases of arson
In the history of the city was
perpetrated about half-past 8
o'clock Sunday evening In the
two-story dwelling house at 201 Vir
ginia avenue, between Twenty-ninth
and Thirtieth streets. The bare facts
known at that time were published in
The Call of yesterday.
The first blaze was discovered by
William A. N. Ferguson, who was
visiting at the house of William A.
Ramsey across the street. Accompa
nied by Mrs. Ramsey he ran across
the way and at the foot of the back
basement stairs he found a burning
string of rags, soaked with coal oil
and leading up to and under the locked
kitchen duor. He extinguished the

Miguel Esqueda, who is accused by his
wife of subjecting her to most inhuman
treatment and then attempting to murder
her In a most brutal manner, was arrest
ed last night by Officers McMahon, Freel
and Hall In the garret of a house at 15
John street.
He is a slight built man with a blonde
mustache and an ugly gleam In his eyes.
While he flatly denies all charges made
against him he is very chary about mak
ing any statements, and seems fearful of
committing himself. He speaks English
with a slight Spanish accent, and while
he answers all questions, will not vol
unteer any Information. He was married
about two years ago by Justice Carroll,
but has not lived regularly with his wife,
who, he claims, dissipated freely. The
last time he admits having seen her was
on the afternoon of the 18th at her room,
1317 Powell street. She was sick at the
time, but had plenty to eat.
The next he heard of her was when
the papers published her story. He then
went to the house of a friend, where ho
has been hiding ever since.
"I was married two years ago," he said
"but I have not lived regularly with my
wife. We quarreled at times, but I never
beat her. I have been working at my
trade as a pressman in various printing
offices, and she has been supporting her

It was afterward discovered was at
tached to a large bucket of coal oil.
As Ferguson returned to the street
he met Mrs. Margaret Shields, the oc
cupant and supposed owner of the
building coming down Prospect place.
He told the woman that some one had
set fire to her house, and that he
would notify the police. Mrs. Shields
said: "Go get your man," and Fer
guson hurled away.
As soon as he departed Mrs. Shields
deliberately walked into th(> front door
of her home and in a moment there
was an explosion and burst of flame
that blew out the glass in the big bay
window and started a furious fire.
A curious phase of the case is the
fact that Mrs. Shields was not seen to
leave the house, and It was at first
supposed that she had lost her life.
However, she had made her escape
through the back yard.
The flames were extinguished after
damaging the building to the extent
of about $500. .
Upon examining the premises It was
found that In addllton to the bucket
of oil in the kitchen there were -two
five-gallon cans in the parlor, one of
which had exploded; another in the
back parlor with the faucet turned on
and another in the back bedroom with
a hole cut in it. The floors of all the
lower rooms had been saturated with
the oil and an old bed t -lounge in the
basement similarly treated. With so

the kitchen of the house where she
worked, but she never gave me money.
"About three months ago she left me

It is a wonder that the building was
saved. Had the fire occurred in the
early morning hours it is very prob
able there would have been loss of life
in the adjoining dwellings.
"It is the boldest, clumsiest and
most deliberate case that has ever
come under my observation," said
Fire Marshal Towe yesterday. "Why,
this woman Shields had enough kero
sene In the house to blow up the block,
and it was not her fault that such
a catastrophe did not happen. Fur
thermore, she exposed the lives of tho
people in the adjoining houses. "We
iln<l that she had the furniture in
sured for $1000. The house was being
purchased from a building and loan
association, and was insured in favor
of the latter for 11500.
"The motive for the crime lies in
tho fact tha; tne furniture, with the
exception of about $25 worth, had been
removed some time Saturday night.
A fine mahogany mantel was also car
ried away. So if the building had been
completely destroyed the woman could
have collected the $1000 and still
have had her property. Furthermore,
she owed everybody around that
neighborhood, and was about to be
sued for the payment of street assess
ments. So the case is plain enough.
""We will locate the woman readily,
but want to find her young compan-
lon, a girl known as 'Llllie, 1 who left
the house' late Saturday evening car
rying a large bundle. She knows all
about this affair, and will do well to
put in an appearance and give up her
information."
The grown daughter, Julia Shields,
went to Stockton several days ago,
and her brother John followed on Sat
urday. He saw Marshal Towe yester
day morning and said the property
was hisâ that he had paid $1700 of the
purchase price of $Soi\i. When asked
why he went to Stockton the niÃht the
furniture was removed, he explained
that he "went to pay hts sister's board
bill." Shields then departed In search
of his mother, promising to return
shortly, but had not put In an appear
ance late yesterday afternoon.
Ferguson and Mrs. Ramsay, who
epoke to Mrs. Shields at the time of
the fire, say that she was dazed â ap
parently drunk or crazy.
Among the property destroyed was a
new piano, upon which no payments
had been mnrle, and which belonged
to a local music dealer.
John Shields was located by Detec
tive Fitzgerald last night. The young
man says he considers his mother de
mented and is willing to assist the
oltlcers to find her. The police are also
looking for Mrs. Lillian Muller, who
lived with Mrs. Shields and is sup
poa <1 to know something about the
case.

KARSSA 'S PRETTY DAUGHTER.
The Old Syrian Fears She Will Be
Abducted.
The old trouble in the Syrian colony
has Ftarted out afresh, and yesterday
Joseph Rahy was arrested on complaint
of Abdullah Karssa on the charge of dis
turbing the peace. HÂ© was released on
bonds.
Karssa has a pretty daughter, 18 years
of age, and when swearing to the com
plaint he said that Rahy and others were
trying to abduct the girl. Sunday he met
Rahy on Second and Natoma streets, near
his house, and Rahy, after abusing him,
put his hand in his hip pocket as if to
draw a revolver. â¢
Rahy denied making the threatening
motion, but admitted that he had some
hot words with Karssa, as Karssa had
been calling him offensive names and he
dared the old man to fight him.
"The fact is," said Rahy. "the girl
wants to get married, but her father is
opposed to it, as ue wants h^r to make
money for him by going into the coun
try peddling his wares. That Is the
whole cause of the trouble. I have known
her since we were children tog-ether, and
she looks upon me as a brother. The idea
of any one wanting to abduct her Is ab
surd."
TTpset the Testimony.
The Supreme Court has reversed the
Judgment of the lower court of Riverside
County in the case of John F. Milner, con
victed of killing S. J. Darrah, on the
ground that the court erred in admitting
certain testimony of n physician, the tes
timony being more expert than relating
to facts.
Darrah sold some land to Milner, the
Hollar reservin" water rights and certain
rights of way over the land. These con
sidrrations were the cause of several dis
putes, resulting in Milner using a shotgun
on Darrah with deadly effect.

affair.
A HOT TIME
EXISTS AMONG
POLICE JUDGES
Low and Mogan Have
a Very Lively Tilt.
EACH CRITICIZES THE OTHER
CAUSE OF TROUBLE, REFUSAL
TO ISSUE WARRANTS.
The Grand Jury May Be Asked to
Straighten Matters Out and
Stop the Annoyance to
the Public.
The atmosphere around the Police
Courts Is surcharged with war spirit, and
at any moment there may be an explo
sion that will have dire results to the
Judges.
There has been friction among the offi
cials for some time as to the issuing of
warrants. Judge Mogan has had more
than his share of them, and the refusal
Saturday to sign the warrant in the Falk
diseased meat case was owing to that
fact. Judge Joachimsen was absent yes
terday, and as neither Judge Low nor
Judge Conlan would take the case Mo
gan agreed to do so.
Yesterday Joseph Platz, a plumber at j
262 a Pine street, applied to Assistant Pros- [
ecuting Attorney Mann of Judge Mogan's !
court for the arrest of some boys who !
had annoyed him by ringing his door bell
and breaking his windows. Mann, after â 
listening to Platz' story, declined to is
sue a warrant, as in his opinion no crime ;
had been committed, and he did not be- 'â â 
lieve in arresting small boys anyhow on
such frivolous charges.
Platz then went to Judge Low and
when the Judge learned that Mann had
refused to issue the warrant he advised [
Platz to take the matter b^ore the Grand
Jury, and he would assist him all in his ;
power.
"it Is time this thing was stopped," said |
the Judge. "Mann tanes all the big cases |
and when a paltry case comes up he
shoves it upon me. Judge Mogan sits
swelling his chest out as he surveys his
crowded court because he gets the impor
tant cases. Ills warrant clerk has no I
right to be in my clerk's oftice anyhow.
He was sent there so as to allow Judge
Mogan to have chambers. I am a Judge
much longer than he and I have to be
without cnambers."
Judge Mogan was very much surprised
when informed of Judge L/OW's outburst,
saying:
"It ill becomes one Judge to criticize
the other in his absence, i suppose that
Judge .Low sees defeat staring him in the i
face at the coming election and that is
the only reason why he should go out of ;
his way to throw a slur at me. If he and
the other Judges would do as much work
as I, they would have some reason to i
complain. 1 am here from ten in the â 
morning till late every' afternoon and
have had some night sessions. I have a
Jury trial every afternoon till October 3 |
and my calendar is full with other cases.
I am a public servant, sworn to do my i
duty and It la to the public I shall look
for a criticism of my work and not to
Judge Low."
Almost every day men have to go
from court to court asking for a warrant
and unless it is stopped the Grand Jury
will be appealed, to and. the blame placed
upon the proper shoulders.
WANT MOPS AND PRUNES.
Germany's Crops Have Failed and
California's Are in Demand.
J. A. Fllcher, manager of the State â 
Board of Trade, has received a letter I
from one of his correspondents, Carl Old
ach, of Hamburg, Germany, which con
tains considerable information that Cali
fornia farmers may well heed. Mr. Old
ach states that the prune crop of nearly
every district in Germany is a practical
failure. The California drjed prune is in
great demand and the prices are good.
He states that if the surplus of the crop
of this State is sent to Kurope he is
sure that the producers will be well re- j
warded.
The writer gives the details and ruling '
prices, which show that this kind or
fruit is almost a luxury in the realm of
the Kaiser. As Mr. Oldach is in the com
mission business and desires to Increase
his California business, Mr. Filcher places
the greatest confidence in what he says.
The same writer also gives valuable in- i
formation as to the condition of the hop j
production in Germany. He says that,
like the prunes the crop in nearly every
district in the German empire has proved
to be a failure. His remarks lead to the
belief that Germany alone would be a fine
market for all of this product that the
States of California, Oregon and Wash
ington could spare.

"I suspect that. I may attribute my recent headaches to
doing so much . night-work of late," said a. lady who earns her
own living. " I had an order to address a large number of en-
velopes and as I was paid by the thousand and others wanted
; the work, too, I sat up pretty late and perhaps worked in a room
not so well ventilated as it might be. As a consequence I have
more than . once had a headache the next day. I have found,
however, that if vl swallow a Ripails Tabule just as soon as I
. have a premonition of the trouble, it staves it off and I escape
Â«cot free. That is why I say that Ripans Tabules are a medicine
lor well people, for lam certainly a healthy woman, but I use the
Tabules now and then and would not like to be without them.**
