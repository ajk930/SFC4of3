WARLIKE PLANS ARE YET IN PROGRESS
SPAIN IS
PLAYING A
SLOW GAME
Ministers Await Action of
Congress Before Tak
ing Final Stand.
Castilians of All Classes Are Most
Patriotic, ar;d if War Erjsues
They Will Fight Stoutly
for Their Boy Kjng.
LONDON, April 17.â The Ma
drid correspondent of the Daily
Mail, telegraphing Sunday, says:
The situation is identical with
that of yesterday, the Ministers
preserving an awaiting attitude.
They believe that by Wednesday
or Thursday the two houses of
CongTess will have definitely
agreed as to the line of action,
and that the course of events
will then depend upon President
McKinley.
In the meantime the draft of the
speech from the throne, which is to be
laid before the Cortes on Wednesday,
has been substantially drawn up. It is
short and strongly worded, but prob
ably will undergo modifications in ac
cordance with events that may take I
place in America during the next few
days.
In official circles it Js said that the
Cuban rebels are waiting for the out
of affairs in the United States
before deciding on a line of conduct.
If America decides to recognize the in
dependence of Cuba they will carry on
the campaign with greater vigor than
before. If, on the ether hand, armed
intervention is only to be recommended,
with the prospect of annexation to fol
low, there will be such a feeling of dis
gust among them that they will prefer
a pacific solution of the trouble by
means of a promise ol a fuller measure
of autonomy.
All internal questions are being
merged in the external crisis. Many
Senators and Deputies are arriving
here. It is believed in political circles
that the debates in the two chambers
will be very brief, and that no party of
any shade of opinion will refuse to
grant the Government the fullest finan
cial assistance in case of an interna
tional conflict.
The Spanish report on the Maine ex
plosion will be published to-morrow or
next day. It is said to be very techni
cal, but to prove that the disaster
originated from an interior cause. It
practically shows that the Americans
concealed documents and refused to
produce proofs for joint us*, as the
Spanish freely did, thus showing their
own good faith.
Strinpf-nt orders have been issued to
the provincial Governors to suppress
any disturbances of an anti-American
character.
At the Cabinet council Saturday tele
grams of a sympathetic nature were
received from South America, while
great patriotic enthusiasm is reported
in the Spanish colonies. The situation
in the Philippines caused some uneasi
ness, but it is not true that more re
inforcements are to be sent there.
Nothing is officially known here yet
of the appointment by the Cuba*i Colo
nial Government of any commission to
negotiate with the insurgents. Very
satisfactory statements were made yes
terday at the Cabinet council as to mil
itary preparations made In view of the
present crisis.
The Madrid correspondent of the
Daily Telegraph, telegraphing Sunday,
says: The greatest enthusiasm is man-
Ifested everywhere among the pec-pie,
who are subscribing even more than
they can afford to the funds for the na
tional defense. I am acquainted with
families who intend to deprive them
selves of one meal a day in order to
FEAR OF REBUFF
RESTRAINS POWERS
NEW YORK, April 17.â Washington correspondent of the Her
ald telegraphs: As a result of an exchange of notes between the Euro
pean powers in regard to the advisability of concerted action in the His
pano-American question the indications to-night are that no further
representations will be made to this Government in the matter. As the
matter rests upon so many circumstances, some of them trivial in char
acter, it cannot be said with absolute positivcness at this time what, the
final result of the notes may be. It was pointed out to me to-night
that Lord" Salisbury is at Nice, and Mr. Balfour, who is acting as Pre
mier, is absent from London and that the Under Secretary of Foreign
Affairs, not having a voice in the policy of ; the Government, cannot
commit Great Britain one way or the other on the proposition made by
the Embassadors of France and Austria, I understand that France
and Austria propose to continue their efforts until the last moment, but
It is felt here that their labors will be of no avail ; and that war be
tween the United States and Spain is absolutely unavoidable. So far
as making separate representation, it can be authoritatively stated that
neither France nor Austria will consider such a thing," knowing full well
that it would be rejected by this Government. :-.-]' It can also be stated
that it is this fear of rebuff that had much to do with the lack of desire
shown by the powers to make any further representations to the United
States. -â ^â .:'>--"/,Y'-. ' â \ ; C:V"\ .\ / 'â¢ - .
The San Francisco Call
give their mite to the Government.
Many officials on small salaries have
resolved to offer one day's pay and
even two to the Government. Boys
under age are asking permission to
serve in the army, their parents having
already assented. Some popular bull
fighters, whose performances are worth
hundreds of thousands of francs year
ly, have resolved to abandon their vo
cations and shoulder rifles in defense
of the fatherland.
I have had a long and interesting
conversation with a diplomatic repre
sentative of one of the European
powers, who requested me not to men
tion his name or his nationality, who
said: "Although war seems certain,
the possibility of peace is not yet elim
inated. The negotiations are proceed
ing without interruption and success is
still possible. Personally, I must say
that it will be very difficult to main
tain peace. The excitement on both
sides of the Atlantic is too strong to be
opposed successfully by the Govern
ments. But what I am certain of is
this: That there will be no real war in
the ordinary sense of the word. Hos
tilities will end almost as soon as they
begin, because Europe will mediate be
tween the belligerents under conditions
which will tend to be extreme-ly favor
able to peace with honor for both sides.
It is then that the marked moderation
of the Spanish Government will bear
fruit.
"The idea of armed intervention by
Europe is absurd and unfounded. Not
one power Is disposed to support such
a suggestion, although all admit that
from the point of view of international
law Spain is in the right and the Unit
ed States in the wrong. It seems to
me, therefore, that Spain will yet en
joy an opportunity of trying the exper
iment of Cuban autonomy. The Min
isters nre certain that their moderate.
Peaceful policy, which hÂ°s made a
great impression upon Europe, will
sooner or later bear good fruft a"<l that
this aspect of neace is not yet disposed
of. At all events negotiations between
the representatives of the powers con
tinue and great hopes are placed in
them."
ISSUES A CALL TO
SUBJECTS OF SPAIN
Consul Torrija Summons Before Him
His Countrymen in Phila
delphia.
PHILADELPHIA, April 17.â Joaquln
M. Torrija, the Spanish consul in this
city, has inserted the following notice
in the newspapers:
"Spanish subjects residing in this
city and its consular district are noti
fied to place themselves at the consul
ate. No. 222 South Third street, at their
earliest convenience."
Senor Torrija declined to discuss the
purpose of the notice, but from another
source it was learned that the probable
object was to complete a registration
of all Spanish subjects in this section.

LONDON, April 17.â Cable advices
were received to-day directing all
American diplomatic and consular offi
cials to watch for movements of Span

report any such movement to Washing

other embassies and consulates have
been similarly instructed.

VANCOUVER BARRACKS, Wash., April 17.-General H. C. Merriam, who has been

PLANS OF THE NAVY AND ARMY.
COAL WILL BE A
WAR CONTRABAND
In So Directing Her Colonies Eng
land Has TaKen Action Desired
by tbe President and Navy.
NEW YORK, April 17.â A Washington special to
the Herald says: In directing her colonies to regard
coal as a contraband of war in the event of hostilities
between the United States and Spain, Great Britain
has taken action, the administration officials say, in
line with the wishes of the President and the naval
authorities. Pressure will be exerted upon France,
Hayti and San Domingo to accomplish the same re
sult, and some attention is being given by the State
Department to South American countries, with a
view to securing from them a declaration of the con
traband character of coaJ as well as an announced
determination on their part not to sell either to Span
ish or American men-of-war a supply of fuel greater
than that necessary to enable belligerent vessels to
steam to the next home port.
So far aa the Danish West Indies are concerned the au
thorities have purchased in their ports all the coal that it
Is possible to secure. With coal declared a contraband of
war the administration officials and naval experts say it
will be impossible for Spanish vessels to operate in the West
Indies or in the Pacific, and as a result the chances of suc
cess for the American arms will be immeasurably enhanced.
Great Britain's declaration c,-f the contraband character of
coal will affect the United State 3 at only one pomt â in the
far East.
The United States now has at Hongkong a fleet of six
vesselsâ the cruisers Baltimore, Olympla, Raleigh and Bos
ton, and the gunboats Concord and Petrel, and these ships
ore awaiting the word to rush to Manila. If the fortifica
tions of the Philippines should stand oft the American fleet
for any length of time, the operations of the vessels would
be greatly embarrassed, for by England's declaration her
colonies will be only allowed to furnish either belligerent
a supply sufficient to take him to his home port. Appreciat
ing the position assumed by the British, Commodore Dewey,
acting under instructions from Secretary Long, has pur
chased a large quantity of coal and has stored it on board
of two colliers which will accompany his fleet to the Philip
pines.
ENGLAND'S ATTITUDE
INIMICAL TO SPAIN.
In Declaring Coal Contraband of
War Great Britain Aids
This Country.
WASHINGTON, April 17.â The action
of Great Britain in declaring coal to be
a contraband of war, as reported from
Jamaica, is said to have a significance
different from that attached to it in the
dispatches. As explained in a high dip
lomatic quarter such an order would
not prevent a vessel of either Spain or
the United* States from taking coal at
Kingston or any other port in the Weat
Indies. Even when this article is con
traband ft ia said to be usual to permit
CONCENTRATION
OF THE TROOPS
Regulars Begin Departing To-Nigr;t
for the Scene of Mobilization
at CrjicKaroauga.
NEW YORK, April 17.â A Washington special to
the Herald says: This was one of the busiest Sun
days the army has seen since the civil war. Many of
the chiefs of more important military bureaus were
at their desks in the War Department practically the
entire day, constantly communicating with the mili
tary commanders of the several branches of the army
which starts on its journey of concentration to-mor
row, and with their subordinates who are at points
of mobilization. Contracts for the transportation of
troops from their present stations to the Gulf will be
signed to-morrow morning, and In the evening the
army intended for the occupation of Cuba will be on
the move.
Major-General Miles, commanding the army, will go
South not later than Wednesday night to take command of
the army in the field and to establish hia headquarters, tak
ing with him his three aids, Captains Michler, Mass and
Davis. Adjutant-General Corbin and Quartermaster-Gen
eral Ladington will also either accompany him or follow him
within the next few days. Army officers are anxiously
awaiting the announcement of the commanding general as
to who is to constitute the remaining members of his staff.
The opposition to the army reorganization bill having
been overcome, and its ultimate passage being now assured,
the question of providing the necessary number of second
lieutenants is agitating the authorities at the War Depart
ment. This bill as it will pass in an amended form will pro
vide for three majors of infantry to each regiment, instead
of one, as the army is now organized, and will therefore
necessitate the appointment of two new majors to each of
the twenty-five regiments. These vacancies will be filled
by promotions of senior captains and will consequently pro
mote fifty second lieutenants and create fifty vacancies in
the list of. second lieutenats of infantry. These vacancies
will be filled by members of this year's graduating class
from West Point, by appointments from the ranks and by a
few appointments from civil life.
a vessel of a belligerent power to take
aboard sufficient coal to carry her to
the next port. Once out of the port,
however, the vessel takes her chances
with her contraband cargo, and it is
liable to seizure as contraband of war
while en route to a port of the bel
ligerent power.
Applying this rule to the present case
It is said that if a Spanish ship went
to Kingston for coal she would be able
to carry a supnly sufficient to carry
her to Porto Rico or Cuba. When
<>nee away from Kingston, however, the
vessel and her cargo would be subject
to seizure by the United States ships.
The same rule, it is said, would apply
in case a ship of Great Britain or any
other country was engaged in carrying
such a contraband article.
The flag would protect the ship as a
Whole, but It would not protect the
contraband article on board, the ship
being subject to search and to seizure
of the contraband article. The rule
would be applicable to ships of Spain,
as the United States naval vessels need
not look to the British Indies for their
coal supplies, whereas Spanish vessels
would rely upon this as well as other
West India ports for supplies.
Soon Will Be a Cruiser.
PHILADELPHIA, April 17.â The
American line steamer St. Paul, which
sailed from New York to-day for this
city, passed the Delaware Capes this
evening. She will reach Cramps' ship
yard to-morrow and on Tuesday morn
ing the work of transforming her into
an auxiliary cruiser will begin. It is
estimated this work will require about
fifteen days.

Ver)om of Malaga Mobs
T^at flssailed Our

Rioting Is Renewed, and One
Madrid Newspaper Declares
Spaniards Should Not

MALAGA, April 17.â The riot
ing which broke out yesterday
was continued last evening. The
gendarmes charged the mob fre
quently and the rioters returned
their attacks with volleys of
stones. Many persons were
bruised and numerous arrests
were made. The city is quieter
this morning.
MADRID, April 17.â The Imparcial,
referring to the attack upon the Amer
ican consulate at Malaga, deplores the
outrage as necessarily calling for apol
ogies, and warns the Malaguenos
against provoking a war which Spain
would avoid if possible. The Imparcial
adds: "Rioting is no proof of courage.
The Greeks made demonstrations
many days in Athens, but this did not
prevent them from quickly forsaking
the heights of Thessaly. ' The Span
iards should enter the conflict like gen
tlemen and not like ruffians."
LONDON, April 17.- -The Malaga cor
respondent of the Daily MpII, tele
graphing at noon Saturday says:
About 10 o'clock last evening (Friday)
a large group of young people who had
already met in another part of the
town for the purpose of organizing a
demonstration, arrived In front of the
American consulate and began to cheer
for Spain. They did not at this stage
utter any cry against the United States.
The chief of police endeavored to
disperse them, but only succeeded in
driving the crowd from the front of the
consulate. The demonstrators then
paraded along the Calle de Larses, the
most frequented street in Malaga, and,
accompanied by a very large crowd,
reassembled in the Plaza de la Consti
tucion. The Civil Governor and Mayor
of the town hastened to the spot to
calm the people, and were received with
wild cheering, but In the meantime a
group posted themselves opposite the
American consulate. They carried a
Spanish banner, -and after uttering
many patriotic cries began to throw
stones at the building.
All the windows were smashed and a
part of the furniture of the consulate
seriously damaged. When the crowd

was at the height of its frenzy a lad
der was brought and a man, getting
hold of the American escutcheon, threw
it to the ground amid immense cheer
ing. The escutcheon was paraded as a
trophy through the streets and ulti
mately carried to the crowded Plaz^
de la Constitucion where its appear-,
ance created great enthusiasm.
Another group, headed by a wellÂ«
known Carlist, went through the prin
cipal streets and passed b; the Con
sulate, shouting: "Vivas!" to Spain, tÂ«
the army, and crying incessantly:
"Death to the United States!" and
"Death to the pig Yankees!" This
groug, largely swollen by people who
had joined it on the way, forced an en
trance into the Cervantes Theater. Tha
representation was stopped arid the or
chestra played a patriotic march, the
whole audience joining in the demon
stration.
The Governor, warned by telephone,
made his appearance. Then some one
â cried: "When the country is in dan
ger no theatrical representation ought
to be given." The audience applauded,
and in a few minutes spontaneously
cleared the theater. From this the sev
eral contingents and people noisily pa
raded the streets, and the demonstra
tions continued until an advanced hour
of the night, the police being power
less. This morning the
American Consulate looked from the
outside as if it had been wrecked, the
stones and the broken glass making
quite a pile on the sidewalk.
The commotion was renewed early
to-day. Several groups carried with
them banners upon which had been
printed representations of the pig, now
treated in Spain as an emblem of
America and as synonymous with
Americans. The authorities, however,
had taken serious measures. The
mounted infantry civil guard had been
called out and the police took positions
in the principal streets. The demonstra
tors tried to get hold of the municipal
banner and to procure the municipal
band, but were prevented in both di
rections.
At noon to-day (Saturday) the de
monstration had practically ended, al
thought the people occasionally in
dulged in patriotic cries and the streets
were full.
The Malaga correspondent of the
Daily Mail in a late dispatch, dated.
Saturday night, says: By order of tha

Thousands of women are cast-up dead
on the shores of life because of their own
ignorance or neglect. No woman can be
free from pain, or safe from the ever-threat-

take proper care of the organs that con-
stitute her womanhood. A woman who
neglects her womanly-self will be sickly,

BROWNSON RETURNS
FROM HIS MISSION
TO EUROPEAN STATES
Complications in the Far East Made It Difficult
for Him to Purchase Ships of War
Abroad.
WASHINGTON, April 17. â Assistant Secretary Roosevelt was at the
Navy Department some time during the morning transacting matters
requiting his attention. He had a visit with Commander Willard H.
Brownson, who has just returned to the United States from his visit
abroad, where he was sent to purchase men-of-war and munitions
for the use of tho United States navy. The commander is looking well
bronzed, and says he had an enjoyable trip, having spent practically
all his time in Italy, France and Ensland. He made a number of rec
ommendationa and reports to Secretary Long during his inspections
I. and will submit the final one to the Secretary to-morrow. He
a-ski'd to be excused from discussing the results of his trip pending
his report to the Secretary.
Commander Brownson, during his visit, was able to gauge the feel
ins which the European nations have for this country in its issue with
Spain. Concerning the Englishmen he remarked that their sympathy
is for the United States, and that they are with us to a man. A great
many Frenchmen sided with Spain, although the commander said his
observations regarding them were ba.sed on reports only. Italy being
one of the Latin countries, there is an element which sympathizes
with Spain, although many of the commercial classes, realizing that
much of the trade of the peninsula is with the United States, look
upon our contention with favor. Commander Brownson says that ow
ing to the uncertain state of affairs in Europe, growing out of the
Eastern Questions, in which most of the great nations are interested,
very few really satisfactory warships are to be found on the market,
while in six months from now when no one will want to purchase
any, no doubt some will he available. Unfinished ships and those of
inferior quality were to be obtained, if desired, but the Governement
rred not to purchase vessels of that kind.
The commander will leave the city to-morrow for New York, where
he is to assume command of the Yankee, to which he has been as
signed.
Government the local authorities of
Malaga waited upon the American Con
sul to-day with an apology for the in
sults. The escutcheon has been re
placed. The press strongly denounces
the occurrences which, it is pointed out,
are likely to intensify the strained rela
tions between the two countries.
To-nitrht, however, the popular de
monstrations were again renewed, but
the authorities acted energetically.

NEW YORK, April 17.â A Washing
ton spetial to the Herald says: In or
der to protect the Bering Sea sealing
fleet and steamers which are expected
to bring gold-laden miners from the
Klondike during the coming summer it
is proposed by the administration to
assign a strong detail of revenue cut
ters, tugs and coast survey vessels to
duty in the North Pacific. Hitherto
it has been the custom to send a fleet
of five revenue cutters, armed with a
few six-pounders to the North Pacific
for the purpose of preventing pelagic
sealing or any other violation of the
sealing patrol, and the cutters have
been under control of the Secretary of
the Treasury.
During the coming season the force
will be a naval force, and its opera
tions will be directed by the Secretary
of the Navy. In view of a possible
contingency that a Spanish privateer
may attempt to capture American
whalers or vessels coming from Alaska,
having on board American miners re
turning from the Klondike it is pro
posed to make the fleet in Bering Sea
a strong one. The five revenue cutters
will be armed with 6-inch guns, six
pounders and machine guns, the tugs
with six pounders ai:d the coast survey
vessels with a battery as formidable
as the structural arrangement will
permit.
Rear Admiral Miller will continue In
command of the Pacific station, but
there is talk of making the Bering Sea
fleet a separate command and placing
an officer with the rank of captain In
command of it. Captain Henry Glass,
who is on duty as captain of the Mare

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, APRIL 18, 1898.
PROBABLE ACTION OF
HOUSE AND SENATE
It Is Believed That the Lower Branch of Congress
Will Not Concur in the Resolution Recog
nizing the Republic of Cuba.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, April 17.
To-morrow the difficult task of ad
justing the differences between the Sen
ate and the House of Representatives
on the Cuban resolutions begins. The
rock on which the two houses split is
the recognition of the independence of
the Cuban republic whjch was incorpo
rated in tie Senate resolution. Were
that clause eliminated nothing would
have prevented immediate concurrence
by the House, as the great majority of
the Republicans of the lower branch of
Congress are eager for a conclusion.
But the action of the Senate declaring
for the recognition of Cuba's independ
ence agamst the direct and specific rec
ommendation of the President has
given the conservatives a rallying cry
from the standpoint of party loyalty,
which proved very effective to-day.
One o* the most prominent Republi
can leaders on the floor of the House
denominated that portion of the Senate

Will Soon Resign From
His Assistant Navy-
Secretaryship.
Demand for Active Service
Reluctantly Granted by
the President.
Will Bo Assigned to Command a
Division of Volunteers or Placed
on the Staff of Miles.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April 17.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
"Assistant Secr.tary Roosevelt has not
resigned. He will do sc as soon as the
work of preparation has ceased, and
the President has promised that he will
appoint 1 . .n on the staff of Major-Gen
eral Miles u r of General Lee. He will
be assigned to command a division of
volunteers.
"This authoritative statement was
made to me to-day by a close personal
friend of the Assistant Secretary of the
Navy who is thoroughly acquainted
with his aspirations and vishes. I
learned from him that Mâ . Roosevelt
has informed both the President and
Secretary Lor of his intention to ask
for war service when hostilities are in
augurated. Iwr. McKinlc-y and Mr.
Long both opposed the idea of losing
such a valuable assistant as Mr. Roose
velt has proved himself to be and
pointed out his value in the Navy De
partment. Naval officials also urged
him to stay in the departmental ser
vice, but Mr. -.oosevelt blieves that a
man should practice what he preaches,
and, notwithstan* .ng the wishes of his
superior officers, he proposes to go to
the front when the war begins.
"As to the position to be given Mr.
Roosevelt, no decision has been
reached. One thing, however, is cer
tain; he will go with the army and not
with the navy, as many naval officers
would like. Mr. I. oosevelt commanded
a National Guard organization for sev
eral years, and consequently feels more
at home in the military department
than he would on board a ship. There
has been talk of attaching him to the
New York militia when it is called into
service, but this, it can be stated on
authority, will not be done. If the
wishes of General Lee ar"> respected â
and they probably will beâ he will be
assigned to duty as his chief of staff,
with rank commensurate with that po
sition."

KEY WEST, April 17.â The Mallory
line steamer L.mpasas, which arrived
on Thursday with coal for the fleet, has
received instructions from the main of
fice to remain at Key West until fur
ther orders, as the Government is ne
! gotiating for her purchase.
nois, Heatwote of Minnesota and other
leaders of the Republican opposition,
and through other agencies has had a
thorough canvass made of the Repub
lican side of the House. To-night he is
confident the Republicans of the House
can be marshaled against yielding to
the Senate on the main issue.
Some of the arguments which those
like Cooper of Wisconsin, Mann of
Illinois and Bromwell of Ohio are
disposed to take the shortest cut out
of tha woods and by agreeing to end
the matter have been such as to shake
the convictions of these gentlemen. The
chief complaint ( f those who want to
concur is that non-concurrence means
delay, complications, possibly a re
opening of diplomatic negotiations and
possibly further concessions by Spain
which will embarrass the United States
when the ti: c for action arrives. Mem
bers have b^en labored with separate
ly, arguments against recognition have
been reiterated and reinforced in the
light of the debate in the Senate.
Espe2ially potent have been the argu
ments advanced. Senators Allison and
Morgan declare that if we recognize
the independence of the existing gov
ernment General Gomez might at any
time negotiate a peace with Spain
which would le ye the United States in
the lurch. When France allied herself
with us in the revolutionary war it
\v;is for the purpose of gaining our in
dependence, but we were held to the
compact by the stipulation that no
peace with Great Britain should be ne
gotiated without - ance's consent.
More than this, it is claimed that there
are c idences that the Senate wfil
yield to the recognition of indepen
dence if the Hou'-t stands firm.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, April 17.
The Spani 'â¢ Minister, Senor Polo y
Barnabe, to-day closed a charter for
the American steamer Olivette of the
Plant line, which will carry practically
the entire Spanish colony of Tampa,
Fla., to Havana to-morrow. In making
the charter the Minister gave assur
ances that in case of hostilities the
steamer would be cleared from Ha
vana, given ample protection and al
lowed to return to an American port.
The Spanish party will number 408,
most erf them being young men who
have offered their services in the Span
ish army in case of war. Some women
and children are included, as they are
part of the colony making the move. It
is said that hostility to Spanish resi
dents in that locality has become
marked of late. The Consul and Vice-
Consul, with two assistants, will re
main at Tampa, the exact point at
which seven regiments of infantry have
been ordered to mobilize within the
next few days, although there is no in
timation that the departure of the
Spanish colony is due to the concentra
tion of United States troops at Tampa.
The Spanish Minister had a compara
tively quiet Sunday, finding time to
take a drive with the Swedish Minis
ter, Mr. Crippe, the two having been
associated here in the diplomatic ser
vice twenty-five years ago. Senor Polo
y Bernabe received a number of dis
patches from Madrid, but they devolved
no new phases of the question, and did
not bear on the reports that Spain
would seek the good offices of the pow
ers in case the House resolutions be
come a law. No official information has
been received here a3 to the reported
negotiations with General Gomez to
ward his surrender, although there is
no disposition to discredit the report.
At the embassies and legations rep
resenting the six great powers of Eu
rope, the unusual activity of the last
three weeks was noticeably relaxed, as
it has now come to be accepted in these
quarters that there will be no action,
certainly none of a radical character,
toward mediation or intervention be
tween Spain and the United States.
NO ARMOR ON THREE
AUXILIARY CRUISERS.
Owing to Lack of Time the Yosemite,
Dixie and Yankee Will Not Be
Protected.
NEW YORK, April 17.â A Newport
News Va., special to the Herald says:
No armor will be placed on the auxil
iary cruisers YoEemite, Dixie and Yan
kee, formerly the steamers El Sud, El
Rio and El Norte of the Morgan line.
This decision was caused by the fact
that the vessels may be needed before
they can receive their armor. Their
main battery will consist of ten six
inch guns, five to a broadside and they
will also be equipped with secondary
batteries of breech-loading rifles. These
ships will be ready to leave here i a
few days. In orcer to prepare for ac
tion as soon as possible work on the
Kearsarge and Kentucky has been
practically suspended for the time be
ing. If rush orders should be received,
however, the battle-ships could be
completed in three or four months. The
hospital ship Sola will be ready for ser
vice Wednesday.
To Cure a Cold in One Day

The genuine has L. B. Q. on each tablet..

Something will depend upo the situa
tion as it appears when the final' re
ports are made to the Speaker in the
morning. The Speaker, however, will
hold that the resolutions as amended
do nor have to go to the committee,
but a motion to concur or njn-concur
is in order. This will bring the whole
question immediately before the House.
It has not yet been decided whether the
motion shall be to non-concur with a
request for a conference or to concur
with an amendment striking out the
recognition of independence, and per
happ makin other slight amendments
in the other sections of the Senate res
olution.
A majority of the Senal^ will give
very little attention to any other sub
ject unt.. the Cuban question is finally
disposed of in Con. ess. That body
having acted upon the resolutions of
independence and intervention the
question is not now properly before it.
but this is 1 1 such intense interest that
Senators wi continue to give it their
individual atte. tion until an adjust
ment with the House is secured. The
supporters of the Senate form of ex
pression are very hopeful that public
sentiment will compel the Ho se to ac
cept the Senate declaration, but they
know th^ the influential conservative
element is" against them and they real
ize that they may be disappointed in
the action of tin House. In that event
they are prepared to stand out against
a surender on the part of the Senate.
How long this determination will hold
remains 3 be developed, but the advo
cates of the recognition of Cuban inde
pendence refuse to be convinced that
any other course than its recognition is
tenable.

by the People of
Santa Rosa.
Irving M. Scott Delivers an Ad

Defenses.
Veterans and National Guards
Parade, and Enthusiasm Runs
* High.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA ROf V. April 17.â The City of
Roses was the scene of an enthusiastic
demonstration to-night, in which al
most the entire population participat
ed. The occasion of this outburst of
popular feeling was the presence in this
city of Hon. Irving M. Scott of fan
Francisco and the delivery of his stir
ring address, "America and Her De
fenses," illustrated with a powerful
stereopticon at the Athenaeum.
Mr. Scott was invited here some daya
ago by Grant O. Richards, the editor
of the Press-Democrat, as a sort of
object lesson to the people. As chair
man of the committee of citizens he ar
ranged a series of popular Sunday af
ternoon meetings to discuss what the
United States might be depended upon
to do in the way of defending herself in
case war should be declared. A big
crowd gathered in the neighborhood of
the Athenaeum and on the streets long
before the hour set for the doors to cc
thrown open.
At 7 o'clock Parks' Santa Rosa band
marched down the streets to the head
quarters of Company E, National
Guard of California, and to the tune of
"Marching Through Georgia" the boys
in blue marched to the headquarters of
Ellsworth Post, Grand Army of the Re
public, and escorted the gallant old
veterans to the theater, where special
seats had been reserved for them. As
thoy marched down the sireer3, the
gray-haired men who so nobly respond
ed to their country's call in '61, and the
gallant youths who soon may have to
follow their example, were cheered and
cheered again by the assembled multi
tude. Marching up the street to the
Grand Hotel the procession was joined
by Mr. Scott and the vice-presidents of
the meeting and then continued to the
Athenaeum.
As the veterans marched down the
aisle of the great auditorium those
present arose to give them a welcome.
Down the aisle they came, the band
playing "The Star-Spangled Banner,"
flaps waving the stars and stripes
showing on the big canvas screen.
Down the aisle they came, some with
one cane, some with two, some on
crutches, some with wooden legs, some
with empty sleeves pinned across their
breasts, but with their hoary heads
held high.
The meeting was called to order by
Mayor J. S. Sweet in an eloquent in
troductory address. After a patriotic
selection by the band Minnesota Mc-
Baln Thompson, the dramatic reader,
rendered a selection appropriate to the
occasion. Twice during her recitation
she was interrupted by the enthusiasm
of the audience at references made to
the country's flag, and at the conclu
sion of her selection the huge building,
packed as it was from pit to dome with
an audience wrought to the highest
pitch of enthusiasm, rang with deafen
ing applause.
After the applause had subsided
Mayor Sweet introduced Mr. Scott and
the lecture began. Throughout the
course of his remarks the speaker kept
the enthusiasm of the audience at the
highest i itch. His showing that it had
always been the policy of the Govern
ment to acquire territory when prac
ticable, even though not necessarily
contiguous, as in the case of Alaska,
â was enthusiastically cheered, and
every time the picture of a modern
warship was thrown upon the screen by
the operator the audience went wild.
The address was stirring and patri
otic and caught the spirit of the audi
ence. Every picture of the stars and
stripes was a signal for the wildest en
thusiasm.
Seated upon the stage with the
speaker were the following prominent
citizens, who acted as vice-presidents:
Mayor James S. Sweet, .chairman;

HAVANA, April 17.â This morning the committee appointed to ron
fer with the rebels left for Santa Cruz in a train on the Batabano- line.
The committee is formed of Senor Dolse, representative of the Colo
nial Government, Senors Giberga, Leopoldo Sola and Trancisco Rabel,
the latter representing the Radical Autonomists. Many relatives of
members of the rebel Governmen-t gave a farewell to the committee.
Some who recently were converted Into autonomism accompanied the
committee as far as Cienaga station, the nearest one to Havana. Mar
quis Rabel and Senor Nicholas Rivera were on the train. The editor
of a Havana newspaper shouted: "Till we see you again, long live
Spain, with honor!" Members of the committee, uncovering their
heads, replied: "Long live Spain, with honcrr!"
Juan Ramirez, a colonel in â > previous war, left on the same train
with Senor Ramon Pastor, a Catalonian belonging to the Liberal par
ty and a wealthy man of Manzanillo. Both went to Manzanillo. The
cars of the train in which thf committee went are painted green. This
color stands for hope. The committee enthusiastically looks for suc
cess. They trust also to the influence of Fluriach, a rich merchant in
Santa Cruz, and on the good sense of those in the field. Weapons for
volunteers have arrived in Havana. The steamer Viliaverde left for
Mexico crowded with high society persons, among them being i'.ie wife
and children of Senor Bruzon, Governor of Havana. No elections were
held to-day. They will tak( place next Sunday. The Herald desires to
state that its news published under Havana date is from Spanish
sources, owing to the fact that all American correspondents -c
obliged to leave Havana with Consul-General Lee. Such news must be
taken with the reservation that this explanation suggests.

QUIET SABBATH AT
THE NATIONS CAPITAL
For the First Time in Weeks the
President Finds Time to At
tend Church.
WASHINGTON, April 17.â To-day
was exceptionally quiet in official cir
cles, and on the surface at least there
were no new developments in the Span
ish situation. The reports of yester
day's action by the Senate were an ab
sorbing subject of discussion and the
probability of what the House will do
was uppermost in everyone's mind.
For the first time in several weeks
the President was able to devote Sun
day almost entirely to himself and to
resume his church-going, which had
been interrupted by the important Sun
day conferences with the members of
the Cabinet. In company with Mrs.
McKinley and some friends the Presi
dent this afternoon went for a long
drive, thoroughly enjoying the country
scenery which, because of the advance
of spring-like weather, has begun to
put on its summer dress. Assistant
Secretary Day was at the White House
for a short time in the morning and
saw the President. Vice-President Ho
bart and Postmaster-General Gary
also called while the President was at
church.
In the War and Navy Departments
there was also lacking that evidence
of activity and rush which has charac
terized them for so many Sundays past.
In the War Department Adjutant-Gen
eral Corbin was at his df-sk for a short
time in the morning. He said there
had been no changes in the details for
the mobilization of troops announced
some days ago, nor any important as
signments of officers. The proposals
from railroads for the transporting of
troops from the various places where
they are now located will be opened to
morrow, and the expectation is that the
Boldiers in many instances will begin
their journeys on the same day.

FORT MONROE. Va., April 17.â
Commodore Schley's ships had a very
quiet Sunday. There was nothing do
ing on the flagship, the Columbia or
the Minneapolis. The Texas and Mas
sachusetts finished coaling and in the
afternoon the Massachusetts shifted
her anchorage, because she was a little
too close to the Minneapolis. Shore
leave was not allowed the men, but this
afternoon there were several visiting
parties among the ships and some of
the men went aboard the training ship
Alliance for a friendly call.

Third Mate Walker
of the Orca Ar
rives in Seattle.
Left the Icebound Fleet of
Whalers Early in
November.
Journeyed Across Arctic Wilds
to Request Aid of the
Vessels' Owners.
FOOD SUPPLIES NEEDED.
When Ho Departed the Crows Were
Living on a Pound of Bread
a Day Each,
Special Dispatch to The CalL
SEATTLE, April 17.â Charles H.
Walker, the third mate of the Orca,
one of the icebound whaling vessels
now In the Arctic waters, arrived in
Seattle to-night. His experience has
been somewhat similar to that of Third
Mate Tllton of the whaler Belvedere,
who made the hazardous trip overland
from the frozen north, arriving two
weeks ago. Walker started from Point
Barrow with a uog team on November
L The hardest part of the trip was
the 680 miles along- the shore line of the
Arctic Ocean to Herschel Island, near
the mouth of the M ickenzie River.
Walker brings advices from the ice
bound lleet both at Point Barrow and
to the eastward. He reports that the
crews will have sufficient food to last
them until the ice breaks up, if they
practice the utmost care and almost
starvation In the consuming of their
limited sir ly. However, he brings an
appeal from the captains of the vari
ous vessels to their owner, the Pacific
Steam WhPling Company, that provis
ions be sent north at the earliest mo
ment. In an interview to-night at his
Lw,me in Seattle, Mr. Walker said:
"There were IS6 people at Point Bar- !
row or on ships near there when I left
on November 1. They had but 400 bar
rels of flour left, after having lived
chiefly on one pound of bread a day i
up to that time. The supply of short
meat and canned goods was very limit
ed. Indians had brought in some fresh
meat, but not in any great quantity, j
The whalers believed that there would
be enough to keen them alive until j
July L The men are quartered in two '
cabins, kept warm with plenty of fuel
consumed in two stoves. When awake
the men spend the long hours in play
ing cards, chess and checkers.
"The only whaling vessel at Point
Barrow is the schooner Rosario, which
was beached before the ice formed.
The Orca was crushed in the ice pack
off Point Franklin, about sixty-five
miles west of Point Barrow, while the
Freeman burned and sank in the same
nity. The steamer Newport and
the steam bark Fearless are ninety-five
miles off Tangent Point, ninety-five
miles east of Point Barrow. The ten
der Genie is still further east, near Pitt
Point. The Belvedere is at Sea Horse
Island and will get out all right. The
steam whalers Balaena, Grampus, Nar
whal and Beluge are at aÃiley Island,
with their crews ( n board.
"All Â«>f these latter vessels are in safe
anchorages. Those near Bailey Island
have plenty of supplies and can get
more from Herschel Island, where the
company has provisions. The crews of
the Genie, Fearless and Newport will
probably go t<> Point Barrow. I figured
them in the 168 that I mentioned. The
bark Wanderer and the steam schooner
Mary D. Hume are safe at Herschel
Island. The Jesse H. Freeman and my
ship, the Orca, were lost early in the
â¢winter.
"After several consultations the cap
tains of the various vessels decided
that they had better establish a perma
nent camp at Point Barrow. Eight men
â were left on board the Belevdere at Sea
Horse, and the remainder went to the
mainland with the crews of the Orca
and Freeman. They then followed the
shore line to Point Barrow. From the
Freeman there were forty-five officers
and men and from the Orca fifty-four.
From the Belvedere twenty went to
Point Barrow. Considerable provisions
were taken along from this vessel.
"The Rosario succeeded in working
her way to the beach and we found
her crew at the Point. The crews of
the Fearless, Genie and Newport were
still on board their vessels, but ex
pected to cc-me to Point Barrow with
thoir provisions."
Mr. Walker says he made the trip out
at the solicitation of William Drynen,
who was in charge of the finances of the
company, and realized the importance
of the officials at San Francisco being
informed of their condition. Mate Til
ton had started a couple of weeks pre
vious via Point Hope, but it was feared
he would never reach the southern
coast. When Walker volunteered to
undertake the hazardous trip it. was
decided that he should go via the,.east
ern route to Herschel Island: then up
the Mackenzie and down the Atha
baska River. He thus describes his ex
perlen
"I selected five dogs frcm the big
pack at Point Barrow and finally en
gaged two Indians to accompany me.
We took but a small supply of bread
and canned goods, hoping to kill suffi
cient game to subsist on until we could
reach Herschel Island, where there
were plenty of supplies reported. We
kept to the coast line and made but
slow progress, as there was consider
able snow. The last three days be
fore reaching Herschel we were prac
tically without food, but pushed on
blindly through the snow. We were
about exhausted when we arrived off
the Island on November 22. The worst
part of the trip was over, but it had
been a terrible strain, and we were all
worn out.
"We were well taken care of at Her
schel. at which station there are three
years' supplies of provisions. We re
mained there until December 16. Bliz
zards and snow prevented our starting
earlier. We started with plenty of pro
visions and it was thought best that
we go up the Peel River to Port Mc-
Phers.in. This distance of 450 miles we
coveted in sixteen days. At the fort I
sent >ack the two Indians with one
dog team and continued on alone. I had
letters to the Hudson Bay Company
agents and procured provisions at the
various posts.
"From Fort McPherson I went across
the trail :>,OO miles to old Fort Goodhope,
on the Mackenzie River. This was a
terrible Journey, but I soon pushed on
to Fort Norman, 200 miles up the river,
and made it In nine days. In eight
days more I was at Fort Higley, 180
miles beyond. I then wen on to Fort
Simpson and to Fort Providence, the
last post on the Mackenzie. I went up
the frozen Athabaska more rapidly,
and finally reached Edmonton, where I
left my dog team and came on to Seat
tle by rail."
Walker r|ns lived in Seattle for sev
eral years. Before going North on the
whaling ship he was in command of
several small Joats operated by a local
mill company.
DON CARLOS DECLARES
SPAIN HAS BLUNDERED.
Should Have Landed an Army and
Captured the United States
a Year Ago.
VENICE. April 17.â Don Carlos, in an
interview here which is mainly a repe
tition of his manifesto, declared that
Spain had mismanaged the Cuban diffi
culties from the first.
"She should have sought a casua
belli a rear ago," he said, "when the
United States was unprepared, and
should have had courage to bombard
New York and to disembark troops
upon the coast of Florida
"The United States would have then
given way. If Spain were now to be
vanquished. Cuba would share the fate
of California and Texas and be ab
sorbed by the Anglo-Saxon element."
In reply to a question as to what
would happen to Spain after a disas
trous war, Don Carlos said:
"The future is in the hands of God.
but Spaniards would not be likely to
rebel against the Government which
had known how to vindicate the old
Castilian honor."

is possible, however, that readjustment of forces may be made
that will advance either Kohn or Seamans.

Comrade Frank "W. dishing enlisted April 20, 1861, when
only 17 years of age, under the first call of President Lincoln
for 75,000 volunteers. The enlistments, however, were so
spontaneous and in such large numbers that tne company to
which he belonged could find no place in a three months' reg
iment. Nine other companies of the sons of Illinois In a similar
predicament, together with the first mentioned company, were
ordered by Governor Yates to rendezvous at Dlxon, 111., to
await the further action of the Government. Early in May,
1861, the call for 300,000 was issued by our martyr President, and
this regiment was the first from Illinois under the call for
volunteers. It was numbered the Thirteenth Inrantry and was
must, into service by Captain John Pope, U. S. A., after

LOST BY FIRE
Explosion at the Hoosac
Tunnel Docks at
Charlestown.
Four Hundred Thousand Bush
eis of Wheat and Other
Cereals Destroyed.
Buildings In Boston Shaken and
People Awakened From Their
Slumber*.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON, April 17.â The roof of the
grrain elevator at Hoosac Tunnel Docks,
Charlestown, was blown completely off
by a dust explosion at 4 o'clock this
morning. The fire that followed not
only destroyed the remaining portion
of the immense structure, but con
sumed nearly the entire contents, over
400,000 bushels of grain, mostly wheat.
The steamer Cambroman, which had
just finished loading at the dock, was
towed out without difficulty, but some
of the small tenements adjoining and a
building used as a distillery for Chapin
& Trull were damaged more or less by
the debris from the roof. The loss is
estimated by fire underwriters at near
ly $700,000, well covered by insurance.
The explosion not only shook the en
tire section of Charlestown, but was
noticeably felt in the city proper and
many of the suburbs. Coming at such
an early hour the tremendous jar
aroused half the city. Three-quarters
of the fire department, including the
two horseless engines and fire boats,
were soon massed in the immediate vi
cinity.
When the first firemen arrived they
found some of the streets impassable,
for portions of the roof were lying in
every direction. Great timbers had
been blown a hundred feet in the air
by the force of the explosion, and many
of the upper stories of neighboring
property were crushed and pierced by
the great beams. The fire burned
fiercely for nearly four hours, and
when It was extinguished there was
only a shell of the structure left, while
bursting from every side were tons and !
tons of wheat and oats.
Much of the gTain fell through the
pier to the dock, while practically the
whole was so thoroughly soaked with
water that the loss was complete.
The grain was valued at about $400,
000. The loss on the structure Is $100,
000, and the damage to the pier and
adjoining property is about $50,000.

Still Owns.
MONTEREY, April 17.-Monterey Coun
ty has, according to a report just made

SANTA CRUZ, April 17.â This has
been a golden day In the history of
Santa Cruz Methodists, and, it might
be said, in the history of Methodism of
the State. The. golden jubilee of Santa.
Cruz Church is being celebrated. The
class of twelve Methodists who banded
together for the cause of Christ in tho
pinoeer days of 1848 builded better than
they knew. The church which they
founded has grown until it numbers
over 400 communicants, and is leading
and aggressive in all good works.
There was almost one continual meet
ing of prayer and praise in the church
from 9 o'clock this morning until eve:i
ing. Th.^ edifice presents a very fine
appearanc*?, the young people having
decorate 1 :t elegantly for the occasicm.
Above the alcove back of the pulDlt
are golden figures "48-98"; ivy is fes
tooned above the choir loft and around
the entire interior. The gulden col
ored Lady Banksia and Beauty of Gla
zenwood roses have been used in profu
sion. The chancel is a bower of beauty,
a mass of ferns and flowers.
Among the visitors who have already
arrived to take part in the exercises
are Bishop William Taylor, who as
sisted in the dedication of the first
building of the Santa Cruz church in
1850; Rev. J. D. Hammond'of the Meth
odist Book Concern of San Francisco;
Dr. Eli McClish, president of the Uni
versity of the Pacific, College Park;
Rev. W. S. Matthews, editor of the
Christian Advocate; Rev. M. C. Briggs
of San Jose; Rev. Alfred Higby of San
Francisco, who was pastor of the
church from 1856 to 1866; Rev. P. G.

At 9 o'clock this morning the golden
jubilee opened with an old-fashioned
Methodist love feast. It was held in I
the church partlors, and they were
crowded to the doors. It was an im
pressive sight, the old and young as
sembling at this service. The leader
was the beloved and venerable Bishop
William Taylor, the patriarch of Meth
odism, who in the fifties was known as
a street preacher of San Francisco, but
who for the greater part of his life has
been one of the most renowned mis
sionaries of the world, having been sta
tioned in Africa. The old songs of Zion
were sung and found a responsive
chord in the hearts of all present. The
Bishop spoke briefly on the verse, "Bless
the Lord, O my soul, and all that is
within me bless his holy name," from
Psalms, and this was the keynote of the
meeting throughout. The stewards of j
the church distributed the elements j
typifying fellowshipâ bread and water
â and then for an hour veterans of the
church gave testimony. Nearly every
one who spoke had reached a good old
age. It was an impressive hour.
Ellhu Anthony, the first pastor, and
Mother Heacox, the oldest member of
the church, who crossed the plains and
arrived in Santa Cruz in 1546, spoke
with much feeling. Then there were
Pastors Briggs, who labored with
Bishop Taylor in early days; Mrs. M.
C. Briggs, who was the only mother
present who had the honor of having
a son as pastor of Santa Cruz Church;
Pastors Higby and Buchanan, Bryant,
Trefren and Peck, whose reminiscences
were all interesting and Inspiring. The
time for closing came only too soon.
When the time for the morning serv
ice arrived the church was crowded to
the doors. Chairs were placed in all
the aisles and many stood throughout.
The pastor, Rev. Thomas Filben, was \
in charge. Seated on the platform was
the first pastor, Rev. Elihu Anthony,
and visiting clergymen. The services
opened with the doxology, followed by j
repeating of Apostles' Creed. An an- j
them was sung by the choir, Rev. J. L. i
Trefren of Oakland offered prayer I
and the scripture was read by Rev. J.
W. Bryant of Salinas. Bishop Taylor
gave a couple of interesting reminiscen
ces of his work in Africa. A very fine
tenor solo, "Angels Around the
Throne," was sung by Walter An- j
thony.
The jubilee sermon by Dr. Eli Mc-
Clish of the University of the Pacific
was one of the grandest ever heard in '
this city. He read for his lesson the !
account" of the transfiguration, as given |
by Saint Matthew. The sermon was
eloquent and at times brought the en
tire audience to tears. At its close a :
number of young people united with the I
church on probation.
Sunday school followed. At 3 o'clock i
there was a "sunset" meeting for per- |
sons over 50 years of age. It was led i
by F. D. Bennett. Here, for an hour '
and a half, testimonials and prayers. !
were offered by persons who had passed
their jubilee year in life. The univer
sal testimony was, "It is good to be
here."
At 6:30 o'clock the parlors were
crowded to the doors at the young peo
ple's rally, led by Frank L. Heath. A
large congregation at night listened to
a treatise form of sermon from Rev.
W. S. Matthews of San Francisco.
To-morrow ni^ht Rev. Eli Anthony
will be honorary chairman and Judge
Storey will preside. It will be an even
ing of congratulations and reminiscence
also. Mayor Clark will speak and all
old pastors will have a few words. Tt
will conclude with a reception in the
church parlors.

The Bakers refused to be arrested
unless they were allowed to carry arms
and unless they were given a guard
composed of friends. These requests
were granted and a ffuard of a hundred
men are with the Bakers.
The parties to the feud all belong to
prominent families. The elder Baker,
who was killed by "Jim" Howard, had
been special Circuit Judge on different
occasions and was the father of A. W.
Baker, a prominent attorney of Man

Young Thief Confesses.
MONTEREY, April 17.â A case of lar
ceny that occurred here Friday night, and
was attended by a good deal of mystery
has been cleared up and' one culprit ar
rested by City Marshal Wolter. Thomas
Doud's slaughter house was broken into
and a whole hog and several hundred
pounds of beef stolen. Doud suspected
young Joe Gregg, a boy lately returned
from Whittier Reform School, and ac
cused him. Gregg confessed and impli
cated Lutes VasQuez, a notorious ex
convict, and another man whose name
he refused to divulge. Gregg was arrested
last night and the Constable is now look

"Dear Mrs. Pixkham:â lt is with
pleasure that I write to you of the
benefit I have derived from using your
wonderful Vegetable Compound. I \Â»Â«s
very ill, suffered with female weak-
ness and displacement of the womb.
"I could not sleep at night, had to walk
the floor, I suffered so with pain in my
side and small of my back. Was trou-
bled with bloating, and at times would
faint away; had a terrible pain in my
heart, a bad taste in my mouth all the
time and would vomit; butnow, thanks
to Mrs. Pinkham and her Vegetable
Compound, I feel well and sleep well,
can do my work without feeling tired;
do not bloat or have any trouble
whatever.
"I sincerely thank you for the good
advice you gave me and for what your
medicine has done for me."
"Cannot Pralao It Enough."
Miss Gertie Duxkix,

" I suffered for some time with pain-
ful and irregular menstruation, falling

tried physicians, but found no relief.
" I was at last persuaded to try Lydia
E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound,

fIN EXHIBIT 0T OIAeW-
ASSURANCE is given that California's mineral
exhibit at the Omaha exposition will be ex
tensive and creditable. It is cheering to know
this, even if the State is not represented by the com
plete display in other respects it could easily and
profitably have made.
But while mining is important, the industry of
fruit-growing is not only this, but is constantly grow
ing. There are other States producing the precious
metals, but in the matter of fruit there is only one
California. The growers would find it to their inter
est to show to the thousands of visitors to the Trans-
Mississippi Exposition something of what can be pro
duced here from orchard and vine. There is no other
State in the Union capable of growing so many va
rieties of fruit or bringing them so close to perfection.
In the rush of other matters public enterprise has
failed. Now private enterprise would find the money
invested in sending a complete array of fruits, fresh,
preserved or made into wines and jellies, to demon
strate how completely California is able to meet the
demands of the market, well invested.
MONEY flSriflMED OF HIS JOB.
SENATOR MONEY of Mississippi seems to be
bogus. He does not have a genuine ring.
Going to Cuba as a representative of a yellow
journal was an indecent thing for him to do. Being
tied by contract to an unclean sheet was enough to
make him feel uncomfortable. He realized that he
had brought reproach upon the honorabl. body to
which he happens to belong, and naturahy was un
comfortable when he got back and found how people
felt about it. As a circulating medium he had not
proved acceptable.
Money resumed his old place as a guide of public
destiny. Another Senator remarked that Money had
been the commissioner of a certain journal. "You
are a liar," responded the affable Money, who seems
to have an inclination toward refined repartee. Here
the incident closed, nobody giving anybody a black
eye nor otherwise deporting himself in ways un
seemly.
Money did apologize later. This was well enough
as far as it went, .but Money did not resign. He owes
his constituents and the people at large at least this
consideration. Not every Senator can be a states
man, but the one who cannot be a gentleman ought
to be somewhere outside the halls of legislation.
We make no further suggestion to Money. If his
employer, Hearst, has no position for him, perhaps
the captaincy of a flatboat will be found open.
MURDERS NEVER SOLVED.
IF the files of the local papers were to be scanned
it would be found that the number of murders re
corded there and then forgotten is most startling.
When there is a sensational case like that of
Eugene Ware, when girls are found dead in the house
of worship, there is detective activity and possibly a
solution of the mystery.
But suppose the victim of the assassin to be a
stranger, a man without money, friends or position.
There is a record that he has been found dead, and
there is nothing more. The local columns of yester
day told of a sojourner whose lifeless body was dis
covered at a cheap lodging-house. He had not left
much, but he was known to have been accompanied
to the place by a woman, and a memorandum by his
bedside announced that he had been robbed. The
woman had disappeared. Her identity is unknown.
Probably it will always be unknown.
A few months ago a man who kept a shooting
gallery on Kearny street was shot. Three bullets
from a single-barreled pistol had entered his brain.
Who was the criminal? Who cares who may have
been the criminal? It is evident that the police sys
tem is sadly short of perfection. If a murderer can
be promptly brought to light there is a tendency to
bring him. If he can't, the matter drops. But there
is a tolerable certainty of a new murder to engross
public attention.
It is really a comfort to learn that the Texas is in
good fighting trim for an engagement at sea. The
necessity had almost seemed to suggest itself of let
ting her stay ashore the next time she got there and
using her for a land fort.
It seems that the powers decline to extend any
more mediation. With thanks for such as they think
they have already extended, we will try to get along
just as wisely as if they were telling us how.
There are soldiers who have been so long at Wash
ington on social duty that they had probably for
gotten that there might be occasions on which full
dres? would not be regarded as a necessity.
(\ LESSON OF THE CRISIS.
A-Jp- the menace of immediate war draws nearer
the need of a canal across Nicaragua becomes
more and more apparent to the public mind.
From all parts of the country come expressions of
regret that the work was not undertaken in time to
have had the waterway open for our fleets in this
emergency, and the unanimity of sentiment on the
subject shows that the danger of war has done more
in a few weeks to rouse popular interest in the enter
prise than was accomplished by all the arguments
drawn from considerations of trade and traffic during
many years of peace.
At this juncture it is not needed that anyone should
point out the advantage the proposed canal would
be to the United States. Nor is it necessary in the
light of the recent vote of $50,000,000 for the purchase
of ships and munitions of war to enter upon any elab
orate argument to show that the canal would not be
too dearly paid for even if it cost $100,000,000, as has
been estimated by those who in the past have op
posed the project. All that is needed now is to urge
that some action be taken by Congress to bring about
the construction of the canal before the lesson of the
situation is either lost sight of in the excitement of
war or forgotten in the establishment of peace.
For many years a project was before Congress to
provide for the construction of a transcontinental
railway connecting the Pacific with the Atlantic
Coast. For a long time, however, our statesmen re
garded the enterprise as too great to be undertaken
and the cost as too large to be supported, and while
there was much talk of the work nothing was done.
At last the Civil War broke out, and then was seen
the imperative necessity for such a road. The result
was that Congress at once provided for its construc
tion. We bore that expense along with the other
expenditures of the war, and counted it as money well
invested.
It would be gratifying if in this respect the history
of the Nicaragua canal should be a repetition of the
history of the transcontinental road. War teaches
this generation the need of the one as it taught the
men of iB6O the need of the other. As we built the
railroad in an impulst of patriotic ardor and found
it a benefit well worth the millions expended, so shall
we find the canal a benefit in times of peace as well
as in war if we go forward with it under the impulse
which now makes itself so strongly felt throughout
the country.
In one respect, however, the building of the trans
continental road serves us as a warning by which we
should profit if we undertake the construction of the
canal. The enterprise should be carried on by the
Government and not by a private company. There
should be no opportunities for such steals and scan
dals as marked and disgraced the railroad work. In
opening the waterway which is to change the face of
the earth, so far as commerce is concerned, and ma
terially add to the glory as well as the wealth of the
nation, we should see to it that nothing occurs to
stain with fraud any portion of the story of the great
accomplishment.
THE WAR OND THE WEATHER.
AS actual war draws nearer the effect on trade
becomes more pronounced. It is shown pri
marily in the steady decrease in the bank
clearings, which, though still ahead of 1897 by upward
of 13 per cent, are nevertheless decreasing. The de
mand for goods is also falling off along the Atlantic
Coast and in the Southern States. The West and
Northwest, being more remote, are less affected, and
in these regions there is still a good distributive trade.
The Pacific Coast has thus far shown no effect what-
ever.
Wall street, too, seems to have been removed
from the zone of disturbance. That shrewd and far
seeing mart discounted the war long ago, and, as re
marked last week, is now exclusively in the hands of
professional operators, the public having withdrawn
to the spectators' stand. It is the general opinion
that even with the actual commencement of warfare
there will be no serious decline in prices of stocks
and bonds, as that has already occurred, though in
the first moments of excitement there may be a tem
porary slump. The money market in New York is
in exceptionally fine shape, the banks being well
stocked with ready money, and with plenty of gold
still due us from Europe. Hence the New York banks
are watching the approach of war with the easy non
chalance of that man who knows he has got all the
money he needs to meet his bills, and more, too.
Meanwhile the volume of legitimate business is enor
mous. The export of wheat from the Atlantic Coast
continues heavy. The official report shows that ex
ports in March were 15.459.575 bushels of wheat
(flour included), against 7.901,722 bushels last year,
and in nine months from the principal ports 163,909,
730 bushels, against 132,676,463 last year. The fail
ures, too, are exceptionally small, those for the past
week being only 254.
The important staples, as a rule, are dull. Wool
was never quieter than at present, and cotton goods
are also inactive. While the iron trade is still rush
ing, it is understood that it is on orders received
some time ago, new business being limited.
In California the question is not war, but weather.
The season has been the driest ever known, at least
of late years. Feed is scarce everywhere, and the
grain crop bids fair to be the smallest for several de
cades. As for hay, it is a question where it is coming
from this year. The hay merchants are looking about
all over the coast for supplies, and have already be
gun to import from Oregon and Utah. But these
sources are new and uncertain, as we have never be
fore had to draw on them, henc; nobody knows how
much they have to sell or how the hay will "feed out"
when it gets here. It may not be adapted to the re
quirements of this climate. But it is a good deal bet
ter than nothing. Meanwhile the price of the local
article goes up a dollar a ton every two or three days,
and the end is not yet. People are getting rid of their
extra horses as fast as possible, the stockmen are
scouring the country for pasture, and the situation is
about as sensational as it can b^ Tor a prosaic staple
like hay, which is popularly supposed to grow every
where and to be had for the mere asking.
The matter would be amusing if it were not serious.
Everybody is talking about hay. The gold fields of
Alaska have been eclipsed by the peaceful hay fields
right under our noses, and it is a common remark
that the man who has a barn full of hay has some
thing better than the Klondike. To aggravate the
situation everything akin to hay is going upâ wheat,
barley, flour, oats, corn, rye, bran, middlings, miH
stufTs, even the very mush we eat for breakfast. And
all this for the want of a little rain.
The farmer who raises anything this year â it makes
very little difference what it is â will be a happy man.
The tendency in all products of the farm is upward.
Even dried fruit, which has been dead in the shell for
months, has awakened from its lethargy and is sell
ing oft briskly, with good prospects for advanced
prices before long. The East has discovered that we
will be shy of fruit out here this year and is buying
k it up with as little fuss as possible so as not to get us
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, APRIL 18, 1898.
excited, in which case we might want too much for
our wares. This same East is scrambling for our
honey also. No rain, no flowers, no honey â this is
the record for 1898. The East has discovered this,
too, and at the present rate of selling there will soon
be very little of this sweet commodity left in the
State. It is indeed an ill wind that blows nobody
good.
But it must not be inferred that we are going to
have a famine. Far from it. We will have enough of
everything for our own use, but there will be less for
export. Prices will be higher all around, but as this
will be good for the farmer, nobody will begrudge
him his good luck. He has certainly waited long
enough for it.
Merchandising is going along as usual. Money is
in its ordinary supply and demand at the familiar
rates of interest. New enterprises are announced
from time to time, and altogether, as far as can be
seen, trade in California is proceeding on its regular
lines, barring the inconvenience resulting from the
deficient rainfall, which is a temporary matter of a
few months at worst.
THE MARCH TO THE FRONT.
GENERAL SHAFTER has done well to follow
the suggestion made in The Call yesterday and
so order the arrangements made for the de
parture of the troops from the Presidio as to permit
them to march through the city on their way to the
front. The people desire at this juncture to salute
the army and the flag. They desire to bid Godspeed
to the boys in blue and cheer them with outbursts of
patriotic voices as they bear Old Glory to the front
where battle waits and honor and justice call.
The war, which now seems inevitable, is in the full
est sense of the word a people's war on the part of the
United States. The cry for redress for the treachery
that wrecked the Maine rose from the hearts of the
people in ail parts of the country, instinctive and
spontaneous, before it was heard in Congress. Men
of all parties, of all sections, of all classes and creeds,
are as one in this sentiment. We have borne with
Spain till forbearance has ceased to be a virtue. The
time for action has come. "Remember the Maine"
is at this time the watchword of the nation.
The ardor of the people awaits the proceedings in
Congress with some impatience, but not with lack of
confidence. That differences of opinion should exist
in both houses as to the best means of acting on the
issue was to have been expected. This invariably
happens among a people where thought is free and
men are earnest. It was the more inevitable in this
instance because the constitution entrusts the Presi
dent with the conduct of our dealings with foreign
nations, but confers upon Congress the exclusive
power to declare war. This has led to something like
a conflict, not of sentiment, perhaps, but of policy.
The majority of the House favors one course, the ma
jority of the Senate another. As a result there is de
lay. It is safe to say, however, that it will not be one
of long continuance. The decision will soon be
reached. War is almost certainly near at hand. The
Presidio garrison is marching to a battle-field.
It goes without saying that whatever course is de
cided upon by Congress will be loyally accepted by
the people, and with a common ardor all will fight the
conflict out on that line. This is no time to permit
minor differences of policy to cause dissensions
among us. It is noted that the divergent views in
Congress do not in any respect correspond with party
lines. Hoar of Massachusetts and Caffery of Louis
iana stand together on one side, and Foraker of Ohio
and Morgan of Alabama are as firmly agreed on the
other. Where all are for the country and none are
for party, differences are soon harmonized. When the
nation moves it will move together â President, Con
gress and the people in one united power.
It is felt that war is imminent and assured within
the wee'- â perhaps within a day. Before the troops
who leave San Francisco reach the Atlantic or Gulf
ports the guns of battle may be roaring. The people
will make their departure, the occasion of a grand
demonstration of patriotism and loyalty.
TROLLEYS ON MARKET STREET.
THE trolley, as now known, should never be per
mitted to mar Market street. Perhaps the most
objectionable feature of the system is the un
sightly overhead wire, with the attendant poles and
the collateral lines, the whole looking like the frame
work of an elongated awning. In a crowded street
the effect is somber and depressing. To permit the
Market street concern to take that thoroughfare for
the use of its paraphernalia would be an imposition
for which there could be no excuse.
It has been shown that underground wires can be
utilized for the electric cars. Certainly no other
should be allowed on Market street, and in time the
overhead wire should be completely abolished as a
needless and ugly menace to public safety. At pres
ent it is well enough in the suburbs, but even there
it is destined to be supplanted by some improved sys
tem, perhaps characterized by an absence of wires
either below or above ground.
When the time shall come for paving Market street
the part of the expense to be borne by the car line
which has the privilege of running there will be found
to be so clearly denned that there will be no occasion
for treaty. No promise of intention to abide by the
municipal regulation, provided the right to use over
head wires be granted, should be given any considera
tion. It is not customary to attach conditions. The
lavf is passed with the idea that it will be obeyed, and
the corporation to which it may apply is impertinent
in thinking that an exception is to be made in its
favor.
HELPING THE GflS MONOPOLY.
PERHAPS the Supervisors have what seems to
them a good reason for refusing privileges to a
company which wishes to compete with the cor
poration at present furnishing the city bad light and
overcharging citizens for illumination the most mel
ancholy. But if they have such reasons the public
would like to know them. Let the Supervisors throw
off their reserve and give the facts. If these can be
expressed in figures and dollar-marks it will be easy
to understand why they appeal to the intelligence of
the board. If they cannot, the matter will remain a
mystery as it is now.
The fact seems curious that the miserable system in
vogue should be so favored that the attempt' of an
other company to enter the field should be met with
open hostility. Of course there is a general under
standing of the truth that certain people love dark
ness because their deeds are evil, but to realize that
any of this reprehensible sort had -got into the Board
of Supervisors would be a distinct shock. People who
do not have the distinguished honor to direct the des
tiny of the city would be glad to have all the light
that could be furnished. They would like it to read
by, to make their streets safe, and a little of it shed
over the Supervisors would be appreciated.
There has been no explanation of the circum
stance that straw bondsmen continue undisturbed to
do business at the old stand.
I
THE PLANETS IN THE EYEING SKY
THE PLANET JUPITER.
ONE by one the planets have wan
dered back to the evening heavens
which they deserted last year, and
with the exception of Mars, are to be
seen scattered over the zodiacal belt
which extends at this season from south
east to northwest. In this latter point
for more than an hour after sunset, Ve
nus flashes with diamond gleam, now as
ever an object of beauty to the unaided
vision. But to the perplexed observer
with a giant t< lescope, what an enigma!
Are those strange markings, undoubt
edly seen by a few in the favored clime
of Arizona, the production of a strained
lens too accurately fitted into its cell, as
some authorities believe, or are they the
real features of that distant world that
fade to indistinct shadings at Milan,
Mount Hamilton and other places, where
skies of lucid "Arizona blue" eeem to be
unknown?
The fact that Venus is earthlike in size
easily leads us to wonder how our Pa
cific would look If viewed across the
chasm of space that separates us from
the evening star. The sparkling orb
above Venus is Mercury, which is also
baffling theory with extraordinary out
lines on its yellow disk. As no other
conspicuous stars are in that direction
at present in the twilight hours, the two
planets are easily identified; and their
movements and gradual approach until
within three degrees of each other on
the ISth of this month exemplify very ef
fectively the distinction, noted even in
primeval times, between the fixed and
wandering stars. After the 23d lnst. Mer
cury will have gone too far sunward
for observation, but Venus will illumine
the western heavens with increasing ra
diance until November next. Scarcely
less brilliant, but of a distinctly golden
hue, the great planet, Jupiter, is now
seen directly east after sunset. Though
now about four hundred and teh millions
of miles distant from the earth, its disk,
eighty-seven thousand miles in diameter,
is quite discernible, even in a small tele
scope, and the well-known belts are trace
able in every clime. On account of the
rapid rotation in ten hours all the fea
tures become visible In one night, and
the frequent changes in detail indicate
that, they are phenomena of the Jovian
atmosphere, with the exception perhaps
of the oval red spot that has been visi
ble on the disk with varying distinctness

COMPULSORY EDUCATION.
To the Editor of The Call: In your
Issue on the Bth inst.. among other valu
able matter, is an editorial lamenting the
failure of citizens to follow up The Call's
exposure of fraud in public office by ar
rests, looking toward conviction of offl
ckil offenders. This failure is there at
tributed to lack of active interest, or to
inatility to realize the wroneness of
wrong, the enormity of crimes against the
public by men in whom the public has
placed trust and to whom it has delegated
authority.
In searching for a remedy for this in
action complained of, we must, perhaps,
despair of changing the mental attitude
or status of adults, or of any great num
ber of them. But there are the children
who will in a few years fill our places.
They need not, of necessity, imitate our
failings, but they will do so if not taught
a better way. "When children are spoken
of most readers bring to mind the sweet,
trim little beings who flock with a burden
of books to our school rooms. Let them
turn for once to the unkempt, untrained,
unlettered little native sons and daugh
ters, v.-ho do not know the companion
ship of schoolmates, who go not to any
school nor learn of any master that they
have the inheritance of freemen, that a
few years will bring them power, through
the rr.afiic vote, over the lives and for
tunes of a city or a State.
Let us recall the fact that over 30,000
children of school age are not in any
school. We, as citizens, fail to give them
the benefits of that training and moral in
struction which is provided by public
funds, taking by this means the risk of
adding aunuallv to the number of the
Inert class complained of. Laying aside
the ethical aspect of compulsory educa
tion, our duty to give to all children an
education befitting free American citi
zens, can we afford to allow this great
number, or any number, to remain un
enlightened in right directions white ex
posed to the worst influences of a large
city? They are being educated! but by
what masters? They are beooming citi
zens, but what class of citizens?
Let our compulsory education laws be
enforced, not only in order to brine In
our legal auota of State funds, but to
save the children to a pure and enlight
ened citizenship and from degradation
and crime. The elementary- committee of
the board has announced a determination
to enforce the law, stating that 10 per
ctnt of the children enrolled by the cen
sus have failed to attend any school.
But this cannot be carried out unless citi
zens in general co-operate with the board.
It is a difficult matter to trace a thousand
children and be sure that they are in
their place day after day. Beside this,
one reason accepted by the law for non
attendance Is that "parents or guardians
arc extremely poor or sick." How does
that sound in connection with "free pub
li 2 schools?" No sooner does a family
become- destitute, unable to buy cloth
ing and books, than their little ones are
allowed to drift, helpless, into ignorance
and idleness. Shame on a city that al
iows such conditions!

for twenty years past. Jupiter is now
more favorably situated for observation
than it will be for about twelve months,
being not far past opposition, which is
the point of nearest approach to the
earth. But radiant though the planet
appears, this is the least advantageous
opposition that has occurred since 1886,
when in aphelion, or that point of its
elliptical orbit farthest from the sun, for
on June 27 it will arrive again at aphelion
as it revolves round the sun in a few
weeks less than twelve years. In the
Eummer of ISO 2it passed perihelion, ana
when in opposition in the October fol
lowing was forty-two millions of miles
nearer than at present. In the interme
diate weeks Professor Barnard, foresee
ing the possibilities of a perihelion oppo
sition, sought and found with the Lick
telescopo the small fifth satellite here
tofore unknown to human vision.
With less luster than Jupiter, but still
conspicuous, the planet Saturn emerges
above the southeastern horfzon before 10
p. m. As almost simultaneously the red
star Antares, in the constellation of the
Scorpion, comes into view a few degrees
to the south, the beautiful pair, like sig
nal lights of different hue, cannot fail
to be recognized. The marvelous ring
system of Saturn, which may be seen
even in a small telescope, will be in a
better position for observation during
the coming season than it has been for
fourteen years past, as the position of
least obliquity with regard to sunlight is
nearly attained. The direction of the
plane of the rings is unalterable, and they
slant sunward only twice during the pe
riod of revolution, which is twenty-nine
and a half years. In 1858 Clerk Maxwelt
proved mathematically that they could be
neither solid nor liquid, as supposed, but
were necessarily composed of a host or
small bodies moving in one plane, but
not keeping pace, as those nearest to the
planet, owing to its attraction, would
have, the greatest velocity. In 1595 Pro
fessor Keeler of the Allegheny Observa
tory detected by means of the spectro
scope the difference of motion of the in
ner and outer portions of the rings, and
thus confirmed visually the accepted
mathematical theory.
The planet Uranus, also in the south
east, shines faintly as a star of fifth mag
nitude, and Neptune may be seen tele
scoplcally in Taurus, but to the coming
of the large planets at this season, when
several orbs of first magnitude are still
visible, is due the unusually starlit as
pect of the evening sky.

NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
Over 30,000 men are employed in the
British dockyards at home and the num
ber will be increased by 2000 during the
present financial year. .
A motion to abolish chaplains In the
French navy was recently made in the
Chamber of Deputies. The argument was
made that chaplains no longer existed in
the army and that the navy had no more
need for them than the army. Their dis
charge would effect a saving of 78,788
francs or $15,756 yearly, but the motion
was defeated by a vote of 344 to 163.
Thornycroft has recently launched a
large sea-going torpedo-boat for the Ger
man navy. It is 211 feet 9 inches in
length. 19 feet 6 inches beam, 7 feet 6
inches draught and displaces 300 tons.
She will have twin screws, engines of
6000 horsepower, and a guaranteed speed
of 27i-4 knots with a load of S4 tons. The
armament will consist of five 3-pounders
and three torpedo tubes.
The Thames Shipbuilding Company of
London has made application to the Rus
sian Government for permission to estab
lish a shipyard on the coast of the Gulf
of Finland or on the Baltic. It offers to
build three vessels within eighteen
months, to use material of Russian
product and to employ only natives, ex
cept the office force, foremen and other
experts, which are to be English. The
company further offers to guarantee that
no vessel, however large, shall be more
than eighteen months building. From
the foregoing it would appear as if
Charles Cramp, now in Russia, is having
a formidable opponent in the Thames
Iron Works.
A new kind of 6-inch projectile from
Vickers has been tried in the British
navy with good results. The projectile
proper has a ring screwed on to its base,
which on being fired expands and makes
a perfect metallic seal, fitting into the
rifled grooves and prevents gases from
passing the base of the shot. Its her
metical tightness overcomes the injuri
ous erroding -'effects which smokeless
powder has on the bore of the gun and
no power is wasted through leaks. With
25 pounds of cordite a velocity of 2694 feet
per second was obtained, and it Is con
fidently believed that with a slightly in
creased but still safe charge a velocity
of 2900 feet will be reached, which is 700
feet more than is got by ordinary
powder.
The battle-ship Goliath was launched
at Chatham, March 23. She is 13,000 tons
displacement and is 390 feet in. length, 74
beam and draws 26 feet. The anno- belt
is of 6-lnch Harveyized steel, 196 feet in
length, and extending 5 feet below and 9
feet above the water-line, and terminates
at the. ends with 12, 10 and 8 inch thick
bulkheads. The barbettes for the four
12-inch wire-wound guns are 12 inches,
and the casemates protecting the twelve
6-inch quick flrers are 6 inches, with
plates at the back 2 inches thick. The
ship is sheathed with wood and the en
gines, developing 13,500 horsepower, are
expected to give a speed of IS% knots.
The coal bunker capacity is 1900 tons,
sufficient for thirty days' steaming at 10
knots an hour.
The greatest apparent defect of modern
navies is the lack of uniformity of the
several ships of one class. Great Britain
comes nearer to having a uniformity
which has the grea,t advantage of mak
ing it possible to transfer officers and
men from one ship to another and make
them feel at home and familiar at once
with their new ship. In the new German
I navy this system will be followed as
closely as possible, and the guns and ma
chinery of the classes to be built wilJ
be interchangeable. The programme
provides for the building of three types
jof vessels, namely battle-ships, large
: cruisers and small cruisers. Designs are
| nearly completed for the large cruisers,
which will be of 8860 tons, 15,000 horse
power and a speed of 21 knots. They will
I carry* batteries of two 9.2-inch in turrets,
j ten 6-inch and ten 3%-inch in broadside
and ten machine guns of I^-inch caliber,
and will also have three torpedo tubes.
They will have triple screws and carry
543 officers and men. These cruisers ex
ceed the New York by 660 tons and are
13 feet longer: their batteries are much
heavier and the complement numbers 59
more. The speed is practically the same,
although the horsepower is 2400 less than
I the New York's.

NATIVE SONS' CELEBRATION.
The Question of Transportation Not
Yet Setledâ High Jinks on
Saturday.
At the meeting of the joint committee
of the 9th of September celebration by the
Native Sons of the Golden West, held
I in Coloma hall in the N. S. building- on
I Saturday night, the committee on trans
; portation, consisting of W. H. Hazell, D.
j C. Martin and L. F. Byington, announced
I through Chairman Hazell that it had
i called on the officers of the Southern
' Pacific Railroad Company to obtain a
i rate for excursionists who might wish to
go to San Jose on Admission day, should
the Native Sons during the session of the
Grand Parlor in Nevada City decide to
hold the annual celebration in the Garden
City. That the reply was that the low
est rate the company could fix was $1 25
for the first 3000 tickets sold and $1 10 for
each ticket sold over and above that
â  number.
I The chairman read a letter the com
i mittee framed and sent to the company.
This set forth that the Native Sons were
discriminated against, as the company
1 was carrying excursionists as low as 05
! cents for the round trip, and that the
i guarantee was not over 600 excursionists,
! while the Native Sons would have at
Least 70u0 people from Sun Francisco.
: Oakland and Alameda. ThJ" letter also
I set forth that the haul from the point
1 named was easy, being short fifty-four
! miles and without transfer, and reminded
the company that last year, when the
Native Sons patronized another line to
I Santa Rosa, the Southern Pacific, of its
1 own volition, offered to, and did carry
passengers by way of Napa Junction,
having a haul of 150 miloa with three
transfers for $1 25.
The chairman added that Mr. Judah
had called upon him shortly after having
received that letter and told him that
owing to the absence of Mr. Stubbs an
immediate answer could not be framed,
but that if there was a delay until the
early part of this week an answer would
be sent. The chairman was of the opin
ion that the company would give a rate
of $1 or better.
The committee was complimented on
its diplomacy, and it was suggested that
the committee should in the meantime
ascertain what arrangements could be
made with other companies, should it be
decided to hold a barbecue and clambake
instead of going to San Jose.
J. L. Fassctt of San Jose stated that
if the celebration takes place in* San Jose
the Native Sons would be received with
as cordial a welcome as they were in
1894, and that an effort would be made
by the citizens of that place to make the
stay in their midst even more pleasant
than it was on the occasion of the pre
vious visit.
The committee, after adding to its
membership delegates from Athens,
Piedmont, Halcyon and Brooklyn parlors,
of Alameda County, adjourned to meet
next Friday night to hear the report of
the transportation committee.
On Saturday night the delegates to the
Grand Parlor that will meet in Nevada
City on the 25th inst. will be the guests
of Stanford Parlor, which will, in accord
ance with an old established custom, pro
vide an ante-Grand Parlor high jinks. A
fine programme has been prepared for the
occasion.

A RIGHTEOUS WAR
Rev. Oliver C. Miller, pastor of the
Church of the Holy Spirit, 2127 Jackson
street, preached on scriptural authority
for waging righteous wars and the bene
fits accruing therefrom. He took his text
from Matt. x:34. "Think not that I am
come to send peace on earth; I came not
to send peace but a sword," and said in
part:
"This declaration from the Itps of
Jesus descriptive of the character of his
mission is apt to be overlooked as we
think of him as the Prince of Peace. In
another place he cautions his followers
not to overlook the fact that his kingdom
is to be founded upon the ruins of the
kingdoms of this world, saying 'Suppose
ye that I come to give peace on earth? I
tell you nay, but rather a division.'
Again he says to his disciples, 'He that
hath no sword let him sell his garment
any buy one.' And only tells his im
pulsive Peter to put up his sword be
cause he will lay down his life as a
willing victim. Jesua is called the cap
tain of our salvation, and although he
â wore no sword he planted the germ
truths that have convulsed the ceutnxies.
This is because the world lieth in
wickedness and Messiah's kingdom must
be builded upon the overthrow of Satan's
empire. The prince of the power of the
air often opposes war because he knows
that the highest development of the race
has always been along the line of blood
shed and struggle. "War is not the final
object, but the means for the establish
ment of Christ's visible reign upon the
earth. Our text is in full accord with
Bethlehem's anthem. It is not Jesus'
plan to patch up old garments with new
cloth, but to overthrow and build anew.
First the sword, then the angel anthem
of good -will and peace. War is by no
means an unmitigated evil, but great
advantages accrue to the race there
from. Nations, Â».ke the martyrs of ma
ternal love, die to give birth to the new
and better regime. We must not forget
that there is -a divine surgery. Wars
thrust men out from the lap of luxury
and save them from becoming a race of
weaklings. Wars with foreign powers
amalgamate, unify and save from sec
tional strife. It is in war that we learn
the value and necessity of sacrifice. Our
own nation needs to be saved from par
tisan strife, and a commercial and social
upheval will do us good. Life in our
land is becoming too metallicâ tame.
We need war to brine: back the lost gem
of the heroic and patriotic. If I be asked
Shall we go to war with Spain. I answer
there is that that is worth more than
human life, and must be maintained at
all hazards. It is national honor and the
eternal principles of justice and hu
manity. War would teach us our help
lessness and dependence upon God, and
to set proper value upon that which is
worth more than gold. The nations now
are like stones In a quarry, they impinge
upon one another and when one is
moved we cannot tell where it will end.
But the sure word of prophecy has told
us that before our Lord's return the
RANSACKED THE ROOMS.
Daring Burglary in a Lodging House
on Market Street.
A daring burglary was committed yes
terday morning in a lodging house at
503 Market street. Mrs. Ayers, the land
lady, was attending church, and on her
return she discovered that her private
apartments had been entered and a gold
watch and chain, a pair of gold bracelets
and $25 in money had been taken. One
of the roomers saw a well-dressed young
man leaving the house, but thinking that
he was a friend of Mrs. Ayers he made
no attempt to intercept him.
The watch belonged to a Mrs. Crowley,
who lives in the house, and was pre
sented to her by a priest for her untiring
efforts In behalf of a Catholic fair over
which he had presided.
A revolving desk belonging to another
roomer waa broken open with a jimmy
and a tin box, which the burglar sup- v
posed contained valuables, taken.
Last night the box was found under the
bed of the room, havine been thrown
there by the housebreaker.

The speaker then said with strong em
phasis, "I am aware that the strongest
sanction I can give to what I have said
is to volunteer my services and offer my
life upon the altar of my country and my
God, either to bear arms or to minister
on battle field and in hospital the con
solations of religion."
IT IS JUSTIFIABLE NOW.
At the Howard-street Methodist Epis
copal Church last night the pastor, John
A. B. Wilson, D.D., before his sermon on
"Counterfeit Religion," from Isa. xxviii;
20, made this address in part to the Boys'
Brigade and the young men of the
church: "You have not been receiving
any dissertations upon war from this
pulpit during these days of excitement.
The action of Congress last night, how
ever, means war in all probability, and if
ever war was righteous and justifiable it
would seem to be so In this case. We
were Indignant when a year and a half
ago the unspeakable Turk put to the
sword and flame Immediately 100,000
Armenians, and we blamed the nations of
Europe for not making a recurrence im
possible by dismembering the Turkish
empire. But we as a nation have per
mitted a so-called Christian nation to
perpetrate outrages and starvation, and
uncalled for disease upon women and
children and noncombatant men, until
400,000 have gone down in awful lingering:
deaths within ninety miles of our border,
and nothing but the massacre of 266
American sailors and the loss of a battle
ship has awakened us to the duty which
we owe our neighbor. And we have
played at diplomacy for sixty days, which
has meant Duo deaths per day to women
and children. At last we are to drive the
savage of the ages from the western hem
isphere by the dreadful ordeal of war.
"Like every other, this will be a young
man's war. Young men are and ever
have been the soldiers of the world. The
Grand Army heroes whom we delight to
honor won their right to our homage
while in their teens and early twenties.
Young men of America will be called
upon to settle the Question of Spanish
right to starve helpless women and chil
dren and to murder sleeping sailors of
this nation by cruel treachery.
"Already the Cadets of the Cross have
offered their services. I congratulate
them and the country that these young
Roman Catholics, in a war with an ex
clusively Roman Catholic country, are
the lirst band of organized churchmen to
iuiticipate their country's call for volun
teers. They thus demonstrate their
patriotism, too often denied them by the
superficial, and when we consider the
enemy they are to right, the demonstra
tion leaves little to be desired. I am quite
aware of the patriotic fervor of the
Boys' Brigade, and I honor it. And their
opportunity will come. A movement is
already inaugurated for a regiment of
those young men pledged against tobacco,
profanity and intoxicants.
"Next to God and our parents comes
duty to our country. But do not rush off
and enlist at the lirst sound of a drum
you hear. Remember that wounding and
death in battle is not the worst results of
war, but the destruction of personal char
acter through evil companionship in
camp. If duty calls you will have a
chance to choose associations of safety
Remember the initiative has already been
taken to bring together those with whom
the dangers of camp life will be minim
ized. One other thing. Do not enlist even
in the service of your country without the
consent of your parents. If they do not
say yes, then do not go. You cannot ex
pect the blessing of God upon you if you
disregard the divine law which says
â¢Honor thy father and thy mother.'
There is no emergency in the coming con
flict which intakes it necessary todisregard
their wishes. I was 32 when the war be
tween the States broke out and 1G when
it closed. It has been the regret of my
life that my parents would not consent to
my enlistment. But I have always been
glad that the principles they imparted
sustained me, and while in agony
throughout the whole period to have a
hand in the conflict, I would take no step
without their consent. Wait, I beg you,
for their consent before enlisting, and
I when it is obtained seek for that regiment
I where the best moral influences will be
about you. And know well what you are
doing. It will be no child's play, ten wili
I die from the dreadful climate where one

John H. Gannon Arrested in Yolo
County and Brought to This
City.
John 11. Gannon was booked at the
City Prison yesterday on a charge of
grand larceny. He was arrested by
Deputy Sheriff Binning of Yolo County
from a description Bent out from police
headquarters.
Gannon is accused of hiring a horse
and buggy from the Club Stables on
Taylor street on April 5. He did not re
turn with the rig, and the proprietor, C
Jensen, swore out a warrant for his ar
rest in Judge Low's court. Circulars
were sent out with a description of Gan
non and the rig.
Gannon traded the buggy with a livery

ceiving $10 bonus, and In Sacramento he
traded the horse, receiving a bonus of
$20.

"OUR DUTY IN WAR."
William C. Bailey of the Golden Gate
Lodge of the Theosophical Society of this
city delivered a lecture at the Odd Fel
lows' Hall last evening, his subject be
ing "Our Duty in War." Prior to the lec
ture Mrs. Bailey read a poem entitled
"Universal Brotherhood." written by Miss
De Shield of San Francisco, and Miss
Wadham sang a solo. Mr. Bailey's line
of argument was the patriotism of home
extending to that of the entire country,
and that in turn to all nations, until all
the people of the world should be united
by a common tie of universal brother
hood. The development of this line of
thought was in keeping with the doctrine
of the Theosophists.
REV. MR. JENKINS ON CUBA
Rev. W. C. Jenkins preached at his
church, Post and Stelner streets, last
night on "Shall Cuba Be Free?" The
text was Acts, xvl:26: "God hath made
of one blood all nations of men." The
speaker argued that the text shows the
brotherhood of man and the existence
of equal social and civil rights. The ques
tion of the freedom of Cuba must be
answered in a different way in' this coun
try from the answer that would come
from the nations that believe in conquest
and the divine rights of kings. The text
would oppose the view of monarchical
government. The speaker did not believe
there would ever be peace on earth until
all the races recognized the broad prin
ciple of the brotherhood of man.

PHILADELPHIA. April 17.â A private
telegram received here to-day announces
the death in an institution near Balti

baseball pitcher. Matthews was about
15 years of age anu retired from the pro
fessional ball field in about 1890, after
hilly twenty years' service in the pro

himself in the first class for more than
half that length of time.
Matthews started in as a professional

Kekiangas of Fort Wayne, Ind., and in '
subsequent years played with the "Lord

clubs.
Matthews was attacked by paresis
about two years ago, and had since been
in a Baltimore institution for treatment. !

SUICIDE OF BEAUTIFUL
ANNA MAY BURSON.
Afflicted by Cancer of the Stomach
the Wife of a Wealthy Man
Kills Herself.
ATLANTIC CITY, N. J., April 17.â
Mrs. .rtnna May Burson shot herself
through the heart at the Hotel Tray
more this afternoon, and died instantly.
She had been afflicted some time with
cancer of the stomach, which was pro
nounced incurable, but she seemed to
grow better here. She left this letter:
"Dear Husband and Father: Please
forgive me for what I am about to do.
The strain is more than I can stand.
"MAY."
Mrs. Burson was thirty-nine years
old, beautiful and well connected and
the wife of J. N. Burson, a wealthy

URGING SPAIN TO
FREE THE CUBANS.
This Said to Be the Final Effort of
Pope Leo to Prevent an Out
break of War.
LONDON, April 18.â The Rome cor
respondent of the Times says: In Vat
ican circles the opinion is still held that
an outbreak of war may yet be pre
vented, and a rumor is afloat to the ef
fect that the Pope is endeavoring to
persuade Spain to recognize the inde
pendence of Cuba,
Among continental diplomatists a
certain degree of irritation is observa
ble at what is alleged to be the attitude
of England. Some of the powers,
which have special reasons to fear the
consequences of Spanish defeat, are
evidently of the opinion that Europe
has lost a opportunity of affirm
ing her interests as a compact political
organization in opposition to the inter
ests of America,
At some future time, it is thought,
England, may rue her failure to co-op
erate with tho other powers in creating
a precedent for united European oppo
sition to American high-handedness. It
is noticeable, however, that a somewhat
inadequate knowledge of the present
state of feeling in America prevails in
quarters where these opinions are en
tertained.
The Rome correspondent of the Daily
News says: I am assured that the
Queen Regent herself, as well as the
Pope and Emperor Francis Joseph of
Austria, would favor abandoning Cuba
as the only means to avert war. Arch
bishop Ireland cables that renouncing
the island is the only possibility of
avoiding war.

RED CROSS TO SEND
SUPPLIES TO CUBA
Navy and Military Escort Will Be
Provided for the Society's
Agents.
WASHINGTON, *April 17.â The Cen
tral Cuban Relief Committee of New
York will load an American steamship
with supplies for the relief of the re
concentrados in Cuba immediately and
dispatch her to Key West for .orders.
She will be followed as soon as possible
by a second ship. Both will sail under
the Red Cross flag and be in charge of
Red Cross agents. A naval and mili
tary escort will be provided in accord
ance with ie Geneva treaty, should
hostilities have broken out before the
arrival at Key West.
A sufficient number of agents of the
American National Red Cross will ac
company the ships to effectually carry
on the distribution. Probably Miss
Barton will Join the first ship at Key
West.
The War and Navy Departments
and Surgeon-General Sternberg have
been notified of the readiness of the
American National Red Cross to ren
der service supplemental to the army
and navy medical departments if called
upon.
SUNDAY BULL FIGHT
INTERESTS MADRID.
People Forget the War Crisis, but
the Pfess Makes Bitter
Criticisms.
MADRID, April 17.â The usual Sun
day bull fight absorbed the people.
overshadowing the action of the United
States Senate as a topic of discussion.
The general tone of the press is firmly
warlike. El Liberal (moderate Repub
lican) welcomes the Senate's decision,
although it is hostile, since it helps to
disentangle a situation which is be
coming insupportable to the Spaniards,
as shown by the outburst at Malaga
and elsewhere. El Liberal expresses
the hope that the Joint committee
will come to a decision quickly, en
abling Spain to know definitely her
fate.
The journals which comment on the
Senate's resolution consid<?r them as
further proof of America's scheme of
annexation, and point out that it comes
on the very day on which the Havana
delegates proposed the starting to con
fer with the Insurgents. Government
circles feel that the resolutions are
fresh obstacles raised to the union of
the insurgents and the autonomists in
Cuba.
GERMANY MEDITATES A
SEIZURE OF SAMOA
Berlin Journal Declares the Emperor
Seeks to Assume Exclusive
Sovereignty.
LONDON, April 17.â The Berlin corre
spondent of the Times says: "Some Im
portance Is attached to the announce
ment of the Correspondenz (National Lib
eral) that Germany meditates the 'event
uality of a stronger display of power at
Samoa, the end in view being the aboli
tion of the condominium, thus enabling
Germany to assume exclusive sovereignty
in the island.'
"The idea is that the engagements of
tbe United States and Great Britain pre
sent a favorable opportunity, but it is
difficult to take the announcement as
rtriously as the German press does, con
j F'.dciing thnt Germany has her hands full
i In China and. as the Frankfurter Zeitung

a display of power and expenditure.' "

In the Present Crisis the Papal Able

All Catholics.
PITTSBURG, Pa., April 17.âMonsi
gnor Martinelli, Papal ablegate to the

adoption when eneraged in such a holy

the sufferings of another country.

ARREST OF
IN ARTISTIC
BURGLAR
He Stole Valuable
Property From the
Keramic Studio.
George Marion, an All-
Around Crook, in
Prison.
Admits His Guilt When Con
fronted With the Evidence
of His Crime.
THE BOOTY RECOVERED.
William Burke, His Supposed Ao
oomplice, Also Taken Into
Custody.
The , daring burglar who entered the
Keramic Decorative Art Studio at 215 Post
street and stole property valued at $1000
Is behind prison bars. His name is George
Marion, and he Is an opium fiend and
all-round crook. He was arrested last
night by Detectives Gibson, Wren, Dinan
and Reynolds as he emerged from an
opium joint, and was at once taJcen to
police headquarters. The detectives also
recovered the stolen property from vari
ous places where it had been Bold by
Marion.
On being confronted with the evidence
of his guilt, Marlon broke down and made
a complete confession. He claimed he
was alone in the job, but despite his
declaration the detectives have arrested
another man, whom they strongly suspect
of having a hand in the burglary. His
name is William Burke, who is also well
known to the police. He was found in
company with Marion, and locked up
penuing further Investigation. The de
tectives are inclined to believe that Burke
assisted Marion in carrying away the
precious booty.
The Keramic Decorative Art Studio was
entered about midnight Thursday. Mar
ion forced an entrance by prying open
the front door with a jimmy. After help
ing himself to several costly pieces of
bric-a-brac he left the store and went to
his room on Dupont street.
He then returned to the studio, and pick
ing out the most valuable articles, again
went to his room, wht-re he secreted the
stolen property under his bed.
Evidently dissatisfied with the amount
of booty, he made a third trip to the
studio, taking all the stuff he could con
veniently carry.
The following morning the burglary was
discovered and the police immediately
notified. Detectives Wren, Gibson, Dinan
and Reynolds were detailed to find the
burglar, and after considerable difficulty
they succeeded In locating a portion of
the stolen property, as well as getting
a good description of the culprit. The
following day they recovered more of the
property and took it to police headquar
ters, where it was turned over to Prop
erty Clerk Moran. Marion managed to
elude them until last night, when he was
arrested on Pine street.
The self-confessed burglar Is well known
to the police. Several months ago he
was arrested for breaking into a tailor
shop and stealing several bolts of cloth.
For some reason he was discharged af

Light Battery to Be Placed in Charge
of a Detachment of
Militia.
MONTEREY, April 17.â Information
has just reached here that a battery of
light artillery will probably be sta

a recent conference between General
W. R. Shafter, U. S. A., and General J.

tillery for this harbor, Santa Cruz and

It is the present plan to convert a por
tion of the National Guard into an ar
tillery regiment, and from this to de
tail certain companies for duty at the
coast harbors. The plan is prladly re

I^ot Any Iramudlats Prospect of More
Public Sensations for tha
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 17.
It is hard to understand why, just at
this time, when the celebrated water
fr>nt litigation seems in a fair way to
reach a termination, a petition should
.-de to tho *War Deuartment to
â¢â¢â¢ the pier-head line of Oakland
r. The fact that an official of the
petitioning !!rn la also an employe of one
of the many branches of the Southern
Pacific Company, is proof that the
ge is not Uosired in the interest of
the <ity of Oakland or ihe State of Cali
fornia. It is evident that the decision of
the Supreme Court is not favorable to the
corporation and that it is prepared to
lend its aid to any scheme that will add
to its chances of keeping all competition
from oft the water front.
This action is at one. an encouraging
eifrn and a menace. It is encouraging
bocauso it shows that the Southern Pa
cific foresees a great future for the Oak
land water front, and it naturally wants
to retain it. No fight would be under
taken and no display of unpopularity
risked if the stake were not worth it.
Tho railroad people would far rather ap
pear yielding and pleasant to this city
than provoke a controversy, so that
when a controversy is provoked the game
is worth the candle. For nearly two years
there have boon wharves, managed by
private owners, on the estuary above the
bridges, and the volume of trade 6>one
has exceeded all expectations. The
Southern Pacific is as alive to such ben
.'.;â . any private Individual, and if
!o it wants no mure competition
than it has at present. It must not be
forgotten that Oakland offers the only
opportunity in the bay for rail and water
Eh this respect it has infinitely
more possibilities than San Francisco,
lut because the Southern Pacific owns
the tracks is no reason why it should
monopolise the water.
To-morrow's meeting wi'.h the Govern
ment engineers is of vital importance to
this city, and it is to bo hoi>ed that the
mercantile bodies who have already
strongly protested against tho change of
harbor lines will make a strong and log
ical showing before the United States
engir.' â 
It would soem to be a wise action for
all the young men Republicans of this
city to unite and form an organization
of which ail can be proud. After the
harmonious nature of the meeting last
Friday night, and the positive declara
tion that the league is not pledged to
any candidate and will not be until after
the convention, there seems to be no
reason why Mr. Pulcifer need not join
the rest. It would be a graceful act to
BO arrajige matters as to let him lill th>>
vice-president's chair or some other
office. When all prejudice la cast aside,
it cannot but be admitted that Pulcifer
has a grievance, and a valid one, but
it is evident also that the, time has
passed when it can be arbitrated. What
ever jugglery- was practiced last year,
and there was some, is past and no good
I'.irpose can be served by resurrecting it.
:aly nothing is to be trained by
fomenting strife between the league and
Its frienus and Mr. Pulcifer and his
friends. It is understood that Pulcifer,
is to call a meeting of his friends n>-xt'
week. Should he do so. it will be decid
edly improper for any members of the
league presided over by Mr. Breed to
1. They have declared that theirs
i.- the only league; they have organised
and should not contenance by their pres
ence anything Mr. Pulcifer may do. It
everybody to call a meet
ing and not to expect opposition from
those not In sympathy.
Matters having reached their present
condition, it would seem to be compara
tively easy to harmonize with dignity on
u.ll sides. A Young Men's Republican
League, with 1000 honest memuers, will
Ise a great force on behalf of the
party in this county, and this is the pur
pow of the league. It is not organized
ct a County Auditor, Â»r a Justice of
the Peace, or an Assemblyman, or a
County Clerk, or a Governor, but to elect
the Republican nominee, and as soon as
it descends to any smaller task it be
i < m<s a piece club and will work more
harm than good to the party it would aid.
A little incident occurred at the court
house on Saturday afternoon that is
worthy of passing mention as it throws
a side light on official life not any too
common. A boy and girlâ they were noth
ing moreâ were anxious to get married.
There was some reason for their anxiety.
The girl was just of age, the boy a little
19. He was an orphan and had no
guardian, and, therefore, no one could
sanction the marriage. Their plight was
made known to Judge Ellsworth just as
he was about to leave for home by a
newspaper man. The Judge looked at the
youths and liked their appearance. He
said if an attorney would act and a re
liable guardian could be found he would
lix matters up. Attorney A. L. Black
offered his Bervtees, and for over an hour
he and the Judge worked to oblige the
young couple. A petition for letters had
to be drawn up, then an affidavit prepared
so that the court fees could be remitted.
Two sureties had to be procured to go

ceased to occupy n prominent place In
thÂ« public mind and the numerous city

situation in the latter half of a fiscal
year with a deficit ahead of them they
cannot do anything very wrong. 80 tnat v
looks ns though tho city was to be given
over entirely for a time to tho nover

There are some office-seekers now tak
ing every opportunity to come before the
public who will wonder why they are so
unpopular on election day. They will
find their answer in the fact that they
nauseated the public with their intense
"unselfish" zeal for tho success of the
party, before there was any necessity or
rtascn for their doing so. Oakland has
seen "dead-sure combinations" shattered
hopelessly, ami will see It again. There

908 Broadway, April 17.
A stranger registered at the Crelltn
Hotel last night as N. O. Randall, and
was found unconscious this morning at
9 o'clock. He Is believed to be K. R.
Bagley, and was evidently known at 613
McAllister street, San Francisco, if he
did not live there. He had made every
effort to conceal his identity, but several
telltale marks were found after a thor
ough inspection.
He engaged the room about fl o'clock
last night, registering from Denver. He
appeared very hard of hearing and sat
reading until late. No one attempted to
converse with him, and when he retired
no one had any cause to suspect what
was to follow. When found this morning
the letter already quoted written on two
sides of a sheet of paper was found in an
envelope addressed "Proprietor, Crellin
Hotel."
The stranger had a valise in which
were several books, four shirts, from
which had been torn the maker's marks,
toilet articles, etc. A fancy vest bore
the name N. R. Bagley under the collar.
On an inside pocket of the black Prince
Albert coat was the same name with
"Februray 13, 1593." These were evidently
overlooked by the suicide, as the watch
pocket was cut out to hide the maker's
name. A Shriner's cap was among his
possessions, but the name and number
were cut out. An Elks' emblem also had
the name and number of the lodge
scratched off. In his pocket was a key
chain, ring, two keys, a cigar clipper and
a flat wallet.
The deceased was about 32 to 35 years
of age, has black curly hair, sallow com
plexion, pointed features, and is about 5
feet 10 inches in height. He wore a
black suit, overcoat, brown derby and
ordinary lace shoes. His unrier lip looked
as though a black mustache had lately
been removed.
He was removed to the Receiving Hos
1 pltal, but died before anything could be
done for him. The body was then taken
to the morgue, where an inquest 'will be
held to-morrow evening. The various
orders wore notified and every effort is
being made to Identify him. If this fails
he will be given the honors due a Mason.
Among the effects in his pockets was a
card containing the name "N. R. Biig-
I ley," and in pencil the address 513 Me
. Alltster street, San Francisco.
T. M. Stateler of Alameda called at the
I Morgue to-night and identified the de-
I ceased as Norton R. Bagley of St. Paul.
i He said he saw him last Tuesday for the
last time, when he had a mustache. He
had known him in the East, and said
he would telegraph to the general office
of the Northern Pacific to-morrow and If
i Bagley had any relatives they could find
i them.
The Coroner telegraphed the grand
scribe of the F. and A. M. at St. Paul
to-night for information regarding Bag
ley's lodge connections.

Professor Syle Lectures.
BERKELEY, April 17.â Professor L Dv
Pont Syle, of the university English de

ing at Stiles Hall on "The Lesson of the
Roman Republic to the American." The
] lecture was the fourth of a series of five
I lectures by Berkeley and Stanford pro
fessors, under the auspices of the Berke
ley Unitarian Society. Next Sunday even
; ing the concluding lecture of the series
i will be given by President David Starr
Jordan of Stanford University.
Professor Syle, in his lecture to-night,
urged it as the duty of every patriotic
American citizen to Btudy the history of
the Roman republic and to loam how to
avoid in America the defects which caused
the downfall of Rome, particularly the
evils in the distribution of wealth.
The profressor declared that the three
: causes of the downfall of the Roman
! empire â the vast accumulation of wealth
the rapid advancement to citizenship of"
foreigners possessing neither the feelings
nor the tradition* of their adopted coun
| try and the accumulation in the cities of
a vaÃt proletariat, idle and consequently
1 viciousâ all of these causes are at work
, undermining the American republic to
day.

continues to grow at its present rate " ho
] declared, "tho fat* of the American ro
i public In sealed. Tho stream of corrunt-
I Ing wealth which poured into Rome from
her provinces in the far east Ib paralleled
by the recent growth of material wealth
in this country. In this rapid growth of
wealth, an important element has been
the discovery of pold In California, which
was probably the jrer-tent moral curno

STRUGGLE FOR
A BIG FORTUNE
One Claimant's Success
Encourages Two
Heirs.
Were Forgotten When John
W. Smith Passed Deeds
Around.
Now They Briivj Suit to Have the
Court Order Equitablo Dis
tribution.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 17.
An action will be brought to-morrow in
tho Superior vfourt to try to annul deeds
covering property valued at a quarter of
a million," and once the estate of the late
John \V. Smith, a capitalist who died in
testate.
John W. Smith is well-known as the
builder of the California and Nevada
! Railroad, and was a very wealthy man.
; During the last months of his life his
came to Oakland from Denver, aÂ«d It Is
j alleged that at different times John W.
Smith gave deeds of different parcels of
* his property to his son Charles and
others, so that when he died, there was
no need of a will and only a few thou
sand dollars in bank.
A creditor named McSorley, finding that
there was no estate from which to col
! lect. brought suit to have the adrninis
j trator, C. K. King, removed on the
I ground that he was incompetent and had
entered into an alleged conspiracy with
I Charles H. Smith to keep certain heirs
! and creditors from participating. It has
come to the knowledge of Sadie Elizabeth
Thompson and Lenna S. Snodgrass that
the claim of McSorley is to be paid and
that the suit will be dismissed to-morrow.
This, it is believed, is being done to avoid
a contest over the deeds. The deeds, it
j is claimed, were never legally delivered
and were all conditional inasmuch as, al
though they conveyed valuable property
to Charles H. Smith and others, John w.
Smith was to have the use of the property
during his lifetime.
These facts coming to the knowledge of
Sadie E. Thompson and Lenna S. Snod
grass, two heirs to whom nothing was
deeded, they have, through their attorney.
Darwin C. de Golia, brought suit to have
Administrator King removed and to have
the large transfers of property to Charles
H. Smith set aside and the estate dis
posed of as any other estate would be
where the owner dies without leaving a
will.
The complaint pets out that "Charles H.
Smith, falsely representing himself to be
a resident of the State of California, re
quested, and by false representation pro
cured, the appointment of one C. K. King
as administrator of the estate; that said
King is the agent and confidant of
Charles H. Smith, and all his acts have
been for the sole interest of Charles H.
Smith and to the detriment of the other
heirs at law, and particularly to the peti
tioners."
It is further charged that King has
mismanaged the estate and that he knows
! the purported deeds are valueless, but has
token no steps to have them set aside.
The complaint says "said King, well
knowing that Elizabeth Smith, widow of
said John W. Smith, deceased. Is and was
an heir at law. willfully omitted any men
tion of said widow In any of the papers
filed by him in the matter of said estate.
"That said King, well knowing that cer
tain attempted transfers of property by
J. W. Smith, deceased, during- his life
time, nnd on or about August 14. 1595, to
said Charles IT. Smith and Albert B.
I Smith. May M. Clark. Martruerite O. Rice.
i Martha J. Hart, Laura W. Portor and
I Anna It. Caynless were invalid and with
out force and effect, has neglected and
refuser! to recover such property for said
estate."
There are many leading attorneys In the
case, and an interesting legal fight is
promised.

John Utschig Was Said to Have
"Scooped" Everything in

Valuable Prizes Won by the Quick-
Eyed Marksman- The Full
Soores.
The great annual prize shooting fes
tival of the California Schuetzen Club is
now a matter of ancient history. Rifles
were popping all day at Schuetzen Park,
near San Rafael, yesterday. John
Utschig nearly gave himself heart dis
ease by making 74 out of a possible 73
points on the ring target and 72 on the
honorary target. Miss Regina Plage
mann, prospective author of "How to
Shoot, Though a Woman," won the
ladies' prize by a score of 16, and Philo,
the Jacobite, he of the editorial carpet
slippers, made 69 points.
Shooting began at 9:30 a, m. and con-
tinued until 6 p. m. Eloquent speeches
were made at dinner by President
Ehrenpfort, Phllo Jacoby and Judge
Bahrs.
The Helvetia Rifle Club of Sacramento
was present by special invitation and
made a pood showing. Present from this
club were President Jacob Myer, E.
Schmidt. M. Miller, Capt. F. Ruhstaller.
Albert Meister, William Lampert, Albert
Haingue and E. E. Myer. From San
Jose came Captain Karl Klein and John
B. Kerwin of the San Jose Turner
Schuetzen Rifle Company.
The shooting was remarkably good
over the whole day, over a dozen coming

tion to the $275 given for cash prizes for
shooting on the ring targets, $1000 in
valuable prizes was won by those who
distinguished themselves on the honor
ary targets. T. J. Carroll, who has been
shooting-master of the club for eight
years, deserves special mention for the
trouble He took In entertaining visiting
delegations. District Attorney Martinelll
of Marln County stood around with the
tears of anguish running down his
cheeksâ he was only able to splinter the
fence.

made known Tuesday evening at D. B.
Faktor's place, 14 Ellis street. Captain
Kuhls made 72 on the honorary target,

COURSING AT THE TWO PARKS.
UNION PARK.
The card at Union Park yesterday In
the Reserve and Consolation stakes of
fered the very best of sport to the de
votees of coursing, and inasmuch as a
number of shortenders won, the talent re
turned home happy, with the coin in their
pockets. There were a half dozen occa
sions in the commission books when the
knowing ones started the ball rolling at
long odds and were caught up with short
turns; especially was this the case in
the White Chief and Theron course in the
first ties. The latter led to the hare and
was, the hot thins in the ring, but the
hare doubled on him and White Chief
took possession on the fluke and won.
There was an unusually large crowd
present yesterday, the betting was heavy,
the hares fast and strong, the courses
long and exciting, and no accidents hap
pened to mar the pleasure of the sport.
Cavalier won the final from Sweet Lips
by his endurance, speed and pluck. Book
maker Wai ten laid 45 to 1 against him at
the openine, but after his course with
Van Needa the talent got a line on his
superb form, and the odds took a rapid
slump and closed at little better than
even money. â  ;' V
In the first ties Metallic, a shortender,
v. on from Eclipse, and the majority of the
ring looked sick, and they had not the
time to recover before Forget, at 7 to 1,
lowered the colors of the peerless Rusty
Gold. This was the greatest surprise of
the day, as White Chiefs victory over
Theron was purely a fluke.
In the first ties in the Consolation stake.
In the course between Santa Alecia and
Terrcna, the latter was the favorite, but
the first run was a "no go." and the
odds gave way to even money. In the
next course Santa Alecia won by a safe
margin, although there was some dissat
isfaction expressed by the crowd. Ter
rona led to the hare, but Alecia turned,
wrenched and killed. The kick came
mostly from the touts who had lost about
$2 apiece.
In the Consolation stake Chartist won
the final by beautiful work. He sold after
the first ties as hijrh as 6 to 1. In the
final he put out the favorite. Firm Friend,
and added another score to the tally of
the shortenders for the day.

Handball Tournament.
The management of the San Francisco
Handball Court at SSS Howard street
has in contemplation the getting up of a
tournament in the near future, and for
this purpose offers medals for a series
of championship games between the best
teams in the city. In a discussion of the
matter between several of the players
yesterday afternoon there appeared to be
a general desire that such a series should
be played. It was suggested that the fol
lowing teams should be coupled, but in
asmuch as many of the proposed partici
pants were not present nothing conclu
sive was determined. The teams as pro
posed are as follows: Kilgallon and
Hampton, Linehan and 'White, Bonnet
and Murphy, Riordan and Collins and
Nealon and Toy. Should these players
consent to play as coupled the games
will be well worth witnessing, and the
general opinion as expressed by those
who should know and who were con
sulted on the matter w;is that it would
be difficult to choose the winners. The
matter will be brought to the attention
of the players in the near future and
there is little doubt ' that all con
cerned will agree to the coupling as pro
posed. There will be two medals for the
first and second teams.
The play at this court yesterday was
up to the usual standard. The results of
the day's play are as follows:
E Crawford aDd D. D'Arcy defeated P.
Talo and T. Foley. Score: 21-15. 14-21. 21-17.

INGLESIDE.
Over 5000 people saw splendid coursing
al the Ingleside coursing grounds yeater
day. The hounds were all fast and the
hares were In unusually good order. The
talent was in a quandary during the
afternoon, as short enders walked In
without much effort.
The form players were of the opinion
that Pet Kirby would win the stake, but
as the winners dwindled down a strong
play was made on Seminole, who won *hÂ«
money in handy fashion. Gladiator was
a disappointment to many, but they
seemed to pull up In the other courses,
although many were at the bad when the
final was announced.
The entire card was evenly drawn, and
! in consequence money was simply poured
into the pool boxes. Rather a strong
play went down on Firenza to win the
final, but a guessing contest proved Sem
inole the winner. The splendid form
shown by Van Cloie will warrant a stake
winner in the near future, and money
will be plentiful when she starts against
' any number of fleet hounds. It Is due to
i not only the training of the fleet one,
but the blood itself, which is oound to
tell within a few weeks.
Those who played against the flyer In
i the lirst two or three courses were sorry
they were not form players, but in the
end the game little hound went down,
afu-r a hard and well-fought course.
Two or three "kicks" were made
1 agrainst the decision given by Judge
Grace, but it is always so on any track
: where races are started. The sport dur
ing the day proved exceptionally good,
; and the majority of visitors went home
, satisfied with the day's sport.

AMONG THE SHOOTERS.
Members of the National Guard Prac

The conditions for making high scores,
at She.i Mound range, yesterday, were ex
cellent. The light was good and there !
was not enough wind to cause any an
noyance. At no time during the day was
it found necessary to change the wind
gauges of the rifles more than two points.
yesterday, however, was an off day at ,
Shell Mound, there being but few marks
men at the range, many no doubt having j
been attracted to the big shoot at Schuet
zen Park.
Company F of the Fifth Infantry made j
some excellent scores in a practice shoot .
at the 200 and 500 yard targets. The |
shooting commenced at the 200 yard tar- |

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, APRIL 18, 189$
FOUGHT FOR
A FAIR ONE
THEY LOVED
Ed Parker and Wil
liam McCurren as
Hard Hitters.
Walked to the Ocean
Beach to Draw Blood
for Honor's Sake.
In Six Rounds a Colored Lad
Forgot He Had the Affec
tions of Any One.
THE POLICE TROUBLESOME
Weight and Hard Hittin.j Carried the
Day, But Another Go May
Soon Follow.
Ed Parker, colored, is now a back num
ber so far as winning the affections of
the girl loved and courted by William
McCurren is concerned. Yesterday after
noon the battle was fought, and for six
hard and vicious rounds the blood flowed
from punches given with .fcur ounce
gloves, and the winner left the field vic
torious, but at the same time rather dis
abled from a standpoint of physical
beauty.
For weeks and weeks the two parties
have passed words which were not of the
sweetest, and yesterday the disturbance
was drawn to a conclusion with McCur
ren- plainly a winner for the hand and
heart of the girl in question. Out in the
desertâ or rather barnâ the ring was
pitched, and with a determination to do ;
or die the two youngsters started to an
nihilate one another.
Early in the afternoon the two com
batants started for a field large enough
for the fray, followed by admirers and
seconds. For miles and miles they
tramped after the end of the car line was
reached, but at each stopping point a
bluecoat seemed to pop up serenely, and
a change of location was quickly made.
From Ingleslde to San Mateo County was
quickly traversed, but rest or fight was
not yet to be had as there were others.
Finally a tent was pitched near the
ocean beach, but it was finally decided
to fight in a deserted barn called the
Ocean View barn, or stopping place. For
fear more interruption would follow, the
men were soon placed In position and the
go was on. It was plainly seen from the
start that McCurren would be the win
ner, but the colored lad stayed with it
until he was completely knocked out in
the sixth round. Then the fun com
menced. Many were there who thought
the mill had not been carried off in the
best of shape, and were willing to try
conclusions with any of the number of
the opposition.
While the fight was in progress some
points were witnessed and some blows de
livered which would be acceptable . to any
patron of the arena. Cross counters,
Bide stops and swings were thrown in
with indistinguishable precision, and fin
ally, when the colored lad reposed on the
floor of the deserted barn, a sigh of re
lief on some sides and of worriment on
the others filled the atmosphere in the
neighborhood. Those who had backed the
winner wanted to shout, but the vicinity
was not healthy for such demonstrations
and their anxiety was squelched.
The fight by rounds was a wonder as
far as exclamations of the participants
was concerned. "She's mine" one would
say. and the other would reply, "Wait
until you w*.ke up from a Rip Van Winkle
sleep. 1 '
The mill was almost furious at times,
but the sport was all right from a punch
ing standpoint. "Now dar, my honey,
don' you tink you was satisfactorily Jus
tified' for inflicting punishment on the
floating ribs of the aggressor?" But a
whack would soon satisfy the questioner
that he v:as mistaken on the item of
sneed or staying powers.
It is rumored that another go will bo
arranged, as the condition of Parker was
not of the best, but there are many who
saw the mill who are willing to bet that
thÂ» Mexican lad ran "do" the colored boy
with a punch. However, the money will
be readily covered by those who are still
believersin the strength and hitting pow
ers of trip lad who fought for the affec
tions of a girl with whom he had traveled
for many a day. -V-^'
The fighters wore evidently in earnest
as they had to walk about five miles to
arrive at a. place where the mill could
be carried off, and. in consequence, those
who paw the punches were satisfied that
the go was for blood or the well wishes
of the girl whose name has been kept
In the minds of thp combatants alone.
"What will the poor rlrl do?" If both
should have dropped dead together. was
freely asked and answered, but those who
are a warn of the stances surround
ing the fight think that there are others
on the llnp who may suit the fair one.
and he"cc. tr"> bitter fight nut up by those
who thought, they were the only "peb
bles on the water front."
A SPRING OUTING.
The Dolphin Swimming and Boating
Club Holds a Sticcessful Picnic
at Mirabel Park.
Nearly 1400 pleasure seekers. armed with
lunch baskets and togged out in their
summer finery, journeyed to Mirabel Park
yesterday to participate in the twentieth
annual excursion and picnic of the Dol
phin Swimming and Boating Club.
It being the first picnic of importance of
the season, a larger crowd than that
which attended was anticipated. Two
thirds of the merry-makers were of the
male species, which led one disgusted
tough to dub it a "stag" affair. The ab
sence of the fair sex may account for the
numerous fights that enlivened the out
ing, despite the energetic efforts of the
police and the club members to suppress
them. Through the watchfulness of the
officers no severe Injuries resulted.
After a comfortable ride of a little over
two hours the picnickers arrived at the
pleasure grounds, and many were the fa
vorable comments on their adaptability
for picnics.
Shuppert's band of eight pieces attract
ed many to the dance hall by their tune
ful melodies, while others enjoyed boat
ing and rambles.
The Dolphins have decided to discon
tinue giving public picnics, as the rough
element cannot be kept away, and their
violent quarrels in former years have In
jured the club's standing in the com
munity.
Who Owns the Coat and Vest?
James Savage, a "dope fiend," was ar
rested in a pawnshop at 666 Howard
street yesterday morning by Policeman
F. W. Smith as he was trying to sell a
seal brown sack coat and vest, which
had a card on them marked "Lot 10.786."
Savage could not give a satisfactory ac
count of how he became possessed of the
articles, and Smith locked him up in "the
tanks" pending further investigation.
Considered the Charter.
Delegates from various labor unions
of this city met yesterday to consider the
new charter, but although a motion to in
dorse it as a whole was made, a vote on
the motion was postponed for one week.

BY A MESSAGE
FROM THE DEAD
A Spiritualistic Seance
Caused a Family
Quarrel.
Mrs. GollÂ«r Was Told by Her
Deceased Husband to Deed
Away Her Property.
Regretted Her Action, but a Peaceful
Settlement 01 the Trouble
Was Effaoted.
The property which was deeded to Mrs.
Bernardino Hildebrandt by her mother-in
law, Phillipina Goller some nine months
ago on account of a spiritualistic message
frum the latter's deceased husband, has
been conveyed to Lottie and Mildred
Strippel, grandchildren of Mrs. Gol
ler, and the suit instituted to set aside
the former deed has been withdrawn.
This arrangement is entirely satisfactory
to all the parties concerned, and the fam
ily which nas been split up with internal
dissension lor many months is once more
happily united.
me property of Mrs. Goller is worth
about *ouw, and it was understood by the
entire family that this should some day
be turned over to the two little grand
children. The daughter-in-law, Mrs.
Hildttrandt, and her husband, had man
aged the property for the old lady and
hud done their work well. Mrs. Hilde
brandt is a spiritualistic medium and fre
quently had sittings with Mrs. Goller. At
one of these Mrs. Goller received a mes
sage from her husband, who had died
some time before, and this message ad
vised her to deed the property to her
daughter-in-law. The reason given was
that the property could be more easily
managed by Mrs. Hildebrandt if it were
in her name. Mrs. Goller did as directed
by her husband's message, and the deeds
were turned over to the daughter-in-law
with the understanding that the property
was to be held in trust for the two chil-
Trouble arose in the family over the
matter, and Mrs. Lillie Strippel, the
mother of the children, and Mrs. Goller
becoming convinced that Mrs. Hilde
brandt had taken possession of the prop
erty from no good motive, brought suit
to set aside the deed, alleging that undue
influence had been used in the transac-
Friends of the family brought about a
j consultation between the aggrieved mem
bers Saturday and a harmonious settle
ment was effected. Mrs. Goller wrote a
' letter over her signature entirely exoner
ating Mrs. Hildebrandt from the sus
' ptcion of mercenary motives in having
j received the deed. In regard to the al
j legation that undue influence had been
â¢ used, she said: "My deed of that prop
] erty to you was made of my own free
; will and choice without any suggestion
: from or request by you."
By means of this letter a peaceful
! reconciliation was brought about. Mrs.
Hildebrandt feeling that if she retained
possession of the real estate some might
: s? till think her motives were not honor
: able, deeded It to the mother of the chil
: dren, who In turn transferred it to the
! little girls themselves. Mr. Hildebrandt
was appointed guardian of the children
I and the management of the property was
left to his care.

A STRANGE SONGSTRESS.
Mme. Melba Violates All the Traditions of Prima Donnas.
SHE DECLINES TO BE INTERVIEWED.
The world, artistic and otherwise, has always agreed that there is nothing more capricious than a prlma
donna. It has allowed her nerves. It has drawn logical conclusions as to why she must travel with a pet poodle and
even pretended to understand how it was that she had to reverse all civilized customs, dine at unusual hours, and
not give vent to spoken words on the night she must sing. It has explained to the satisfaction of all why she al
ways had a detective in the "wings" who primarily was on the lookout for draughts and incidentally to see that
hor jewels were regularly pilfered. All this an Indulgent public has believed, approved and applauded, but never
has it accredited a famous songbird with a dislike of a newspaper notice, an aversion to reporters and a dread of
being interviewed.
Nevertheless, this Is the latest prlma donna truth. No less a personage in the world of song has so said It than
Mme. Melbaâ or, to be more exact. Mme. Melba's representative, Charles Ellis. He stands sponsor for the revela
tion.
"Mme. Melba hates to be interviewed. Mme. Melba can't endure to be photographed." The remarkable Mr.
Ellis makes these astounding statements with as little ado aa if he were explaining how his star only nibbled at
the wing of a reed bird and took a sip of warm milk on the days she sang, reserving her appetite and molars for
the days th^ dear public heard her not.
Mme. Melba came in yesterday morning at 11 o'clock and allowed her tired self to be domiciled at the Palace
A companion, a representative, a representative's representative and twenty-nine trunks followed In her wake.
At 12:"0 Madame and her retinueâ excluding the trunksâ lunched. At 2, Madame yielding to the entreaties of
her representative's representative, Mr. Bhrieber, waited patiently for 10 minutes for press representatives, who,
unhappily, were not punctual. At 3 she went for a drive. At 4 she sought her couch for kindly nature's balmy re
storer, the sirsta, and at 6:30, like a plain, ordinary mortal, she yielded to the urgent demands of the inner woman
and prepared to go to dinner.
It was then that the singer's troubles began. The press representatives who had called while she was out for
her drive and had been advised to call again at 6, only to be told that the prima donna slept, sent up cards once
more at firHO. and gave Madame an attack of "nerves."
Mr. Kills, smiling and gracious, met The Call's representative. For his sake Mr. .Ellis 1 hoped and prayed Mme.
Melba would also greet the reportorial presence, but he was doomed to disappointment. Madame was fatigued. Not
five minutes of her valuable time â not even two â could she devote to the newsgatherer. Mr. Ellis was chagrined.
â U'ith unparalleled generosity he offered to submit himself to the dreadful interviewer, as did also Miss Bennett, the
sweet English girl who is the celebrated songstress' companion.
Then the reportorial brow crouded and the journalistic wrath grew apace, and something was said about "lack
of courtesy" and the making of appointments that were not kept. Once again Mr. Ellis returned to the prlma
donna's apartments, and this time .came forth joyous, with an expansive and beaming smile. "Madame will see you,"
he said.
Madame came forth, a symphony in pink. Her dark eyes gleamed from beneath the rim of a coquettish pink
turban, and her strong yet slender figure was gowned in pink brocade and chiffon. Madame regretted the incon

the prayers and accepted the conditions
of the total abstinence pledge after the
dictation of the Archbishop.
The church was crowded to its utmost
capacity, and people, anxious to see the
Impressive ceremony, blocked the aisles
leading to the altar and made ingress and
egress to and from the building impos
sible. Before the commencement 'of the

people. It was found necessary to close
the doors and station several officers to

FLORISTS LOSE
BY ONE TALLY
Tumultuous Combination
of Hits and Errors at
Recreation Park.
San Francisco Wins a Ragged
Game From Athletics at
Central Park.
Soma Brilliant Games by League
Teams In thÂ« Interior
. Towns. â 
ThÂ» bark of the base hit resounded loud
and often throughout the length and
breadth of Recreation Park yesterday.
Errors and circus plays pressed the base
hits hard In the matter of frequency, and
altogether, It was a game full of episode
and uncertainty which held the 300 spec
tators In their seats until the last man
was retired, the score reading San Fran
cisco 18, San Jose j 14.
Luck was an important factor In the
locals' victory. The chief element that
won for your dear old Uncle "Feetsy"
Harris a reputation as a successful base
ball . magnate seems to have been handed
down to his successor, Bunker, for al
though' his team was out-batted and out
played, it managed to peg up another
hole in the percentage table.
Bunker tried out a new twlrler during
the game, a mute named Murphyâ
Is, he put him In during the first inning,
but after sending the first three men to
first on a walk, Lee was brought into
the box and Murphy went out to right.
S Lee was exploded for eighteen hits, In- !
eluding - a four-timer over center-field
fence by Goodwin, the prettiest shot of
the season, but ten hits by his aids, to- |
gether with nine judiciously distributed ;
errors by the Florists, saved him from i
defeat.
Manager McGlynn has a hard hitting
team, but it is weak in fielding, ana he- j
Is casting about for new players to stop â 
up the holes with. He has his eye on !
several good men, and unless the young- '
sters now in his employ get down to work
some of them will be turned loose.
One of the incidents of the game was
the idiotic fake of James to work a base
on balls by standing with his back to the
plate. The trick is so fearfully stale and
stupid that no pitcher could be deceived
by it. Mr. James very properly struck i
out; he ought to have been fined $10.
The score hardly tells the exact state !
of affairs, for the young man who kept
the accounts at times became so enrap
tured with the music of ills own chin
thunder as to forget all about his official
duties. Then he would have to guess at
what had happened. However, these are
the figures as he got them down: â¢

CENTRAL PARK.
There are two things that the San
Francisco are badly In â¢ need of, better
pitchers and more practice. The latter
Is of more importance than twirlers, as a !
pitcher , will work to better advantage j
when he knows the men supporting him !
are putting forth their best efforts. To I
have a base hit â¢; marked against, him
when he knows that had the player put
more ginger in , his ..work 'he would have
converted it into an â¢ excusable error
proves disappointing and generally re
sults in the pitcher losing interest in the
game. Neither the Friscos nor the Ath- !
letics, nor any other team in the Pacific !
States League,, is composed . of phe- I
nomenal hitters, and why they should i
roll up fifteen and twenty hits in a garao :
is. beyond comprehension. Either Fitz- j
rick or Perrine has lost his speed I
and cunning or the ball used is as large I
as a balloon. It is true that Fitzpatrick
struck out nine men during ' the game, I
but that is of little credit to him when j
it is . known that twenty-one hits Â« were
made off his delivery.
â Mertes gave a splendid exhibition of
base running and played a good-all-*
round game. "Josh Keilly's home-run
hit aroused the enthusiasm of the crowd
to a high pitch. The following score

A Raw Decision Robs Fresno of a
Hard-Fought Game.
FRESNO, April 17.â The Fresno Ath
letics lost their third straight game to
day, being dceaterl by Oakland by a
score of 10 to 9. Fresno has lost every
game by just one run and it seems im
possible to overcome that hoodoo.
The home team claimed It was robbed
of to-day's game by a rank decision of
Umpire W. F. Long, and there is strong
talk of a protest. It was in the last lialf
of the ninth inning, when the score stood
8 to 10 In Oakland's favor. Fresno had
a man on third and one man out, when
McLaughlln lined out what every one
but the umpire considered a two bagger.
Long called it a foul, however. The
rooters In the grand stand went wild
with excitement. The umpire was hissed
and hooted and there were cries of "Lick
him." An angry crowd gathered around
him at the close of the game, but b<j was
hastily driven out of town. Score of the

McHALE'S GREAT PLAY.
ThÂ« Giants Take a Fall Out of the
Stockton Terrors.
STOCKTON, April 17.-The attendance
at to-day's baseball game between Stock
ton and Sacramento was the largest of
the season, and up to the seventh in
ning, that always being a lucky one for
Stockton, the applause was impartially
distributed, but when the visitors put a
cinch on the game by stopping their op
ponents before they reached first base
the crowd lost heart. Bob McHale made
one of the greatest plays ever seen here,
when in the sixth inning he allowed a
high fly from Peters to strike the ground
before throwing Selna out at second and
retiring Nick Smith at first on two forced
plays. It was entirely unexpected and
the way he scooped up the ball was most
clever.

GUt Edges Make a Spectacle of the
Nine From O^kl^nd.
SACRAMENTO, April 17. -The yellow
est variety of baseball seen here since
the Boston bloomer girls waddled around
the bags was that offered by the Oak
lands of the Pacific States League here
to-day in thefr alleged game with the
Gilt Edge club of this city. About 1000
persons witnessed the first half of the
game, but fully half of the crowd got
tired and did not wait for the finish. The
Gilt Edges were in fine form and had
their opponents known the game would
have put up champion ball. They tired
toward the end and played horse with
the visitors, otherwise the score would
have been still more glaring. The score:
