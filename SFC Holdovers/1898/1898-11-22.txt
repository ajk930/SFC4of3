THEIR FINAL PROPOSITION

Americans Preferred Not to Resume

jected as Being Entirely
Unnecessary.
PARIS, Nov. 21.â The United States
Peace Commissioners have undoubted
ly made their final proposition here.
"When the conference opened this
afternoon Judge Day, addressing Senor
Montero Rios and his colleagues of the
Spanish Commission, recurred to the
protracted negotiations and reaffirmed
the desire of the American Commis-

Bioners to reach an amicable con
clusion.
Then, handing the American presen
tation to the interpreter. Judge Day
concluded his remarks by saying that
the Americans, preferring not to -break
the armistice or to resume hostilities,
had determined to present another and
final proposition which he hoped would
lead to a speedy and amicable adjust
ment.
That portion of the presentation set
ting forth the new proposal that
the United States must have pos
session of the entire Philippine archi
pelago, with a tender- of $20,000,000
for a treaty cession of the islands, was
then read. Without betraying their
mental attitude the Spanish Commis
pinnprs suggested an adjournment un
til Wednesday.
The new proposition, with its collat
erals, was embodied toward the end of
the American memorandum, which fill
ed thirty typewritten sheets. Only this
part was read in the joint session, the
memorandum then being delivered to
the Spaniards for translation by their
own staff.
Spain's proposition to invoke the of
fices of a third power to construe the
words "control, disposition and govern
ment of the Philippines" was rejected
by the American commissioners on the
ground that the diction of the third ar
ticle of the protocol, dealing with the
Philippines, is so broad and clear as to
afford no justification for arbitration
ac between the parties to the agree
ment.
An analysis of the American memo
randum shows that | all other sugges
tions and considerations hinge upon
treaty cessions at the amount named
by the United States and with
in two weeks. In the event of cession,
Spain may enjoy for a term of twelve
yr-nrs rights of commerce in the Phil
ippines equal to those of the United
: StatfÃ. If the United States acquire
the islands by conquest Spain may not
enjoy such rights.
Should Spain refuse cession she would
remain liable for indemnity claims, na
The San Francisco Call
tional and individual, since the out
break of the last Cuban insurrection.
Should she refuse she would also lose,
probably, as further indemnity for the
expense of conquest, one of the Caro
lines, which she may now sell; and
other cable privileges within Spanish
jurisdiction might be taken by the
United States without any return to
Spain for them.
This evening the Spaniards, doubt
less, do not know whether they will ac
cept or reject the American terms.
They are telegraphing the substance of
the American memorandum to Madrid
and they expect a reply at Wednes
day's meeting.
Possibly they may conclude that be
cause one money offer is made another
and larger offer may follow pressure
upon the American Commissioners.
But if this be their expectation It
will not be realized. The American
terms, submitted almost at the close of
the eight weeks of patient hearing and
painstaking argument, are a practical
ultimatum.
WHAT OCCURRED AT
THE JOINT^CONFERENCE
Substance of the Final Terms Sub
mitted to the Spanish Com
missioners.
PARIS, Nov. 21. â The Spanish and
j American Peace Commissions met In
I joint session at 2 o'clock this afternoon.
I The Americans declared they must
j have the entire Philippine archipelago
| and for a treaty cession of the islands
! the Americans tendered to Spain $20,
j 000.000.
It was further declared that it Is the
I purpose of the United States to main-

door" to the world's commerce.
On the tei ma named#the United States

November 28 is fixed as the date on
which the United States Commission
desires a definite response to to-day's
propositions and all other' subjects In
issue here.
It was also declared that the United
States desire a treaty on the religious
freedom of the Caroline Islands, as
agreed upon between the United States
and Spain in 1886; also the acquisition
of one of the Caroline Islands for an
American naval station and of cable
landing rights at oxher places in Span
ish jurisdictir n, and the revival of cer
tain Spanish-American treaties here
tofore in force.
SPAIN WILL CONCEDE ALL THE
DEMANDS OF THE UNITED STATES
This Is the Confident Belief of President
McKinley and His Advisers, Based
on Official Dispatches.
NEW YORK, Nov. 21.â The Herald's Washington correspondent sends the following! War
with Spain will not be resumed. Spain's Peace Commissioners reluctantly, and probably
with formal protests, will sign the treaty of peace within less than a fortnight, embody
ing in full all the demands made by tho United States. This Is the confdent belief of Presi
dent McKinlcy and his official advisers, based upon the logic o* the situation as well as upon
official dispatches received by Secretary Hay from Judge Day, chairman of the American
commission, this evening.
SAN FBANCISCO, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 22, 1898.
The Americans also refused to arbi
trate article 3 of the peace protocol,
bearing upon the future disposition and
control of the Philippine Islands.
The meeting was then adjourned until
Wednesday.
The memorandum of the American
Commission embodying the above
propositions is long and waÃ not read |
in full. The vital portions, however,
were communicated verbally to the
Spanish Commissioaers in practically
these terms:
The fact was cited that the proposal
presented by the American Commis
sioners on behalf of the Government
for the cession of the Philippine Isl
ands to the United States having been
rejected by the Spanish Commissioners
and the counter proposal of the latter
for the withdrawal of the Americans
from the islands and the payment of an
indemnity by the United States to
Spain having been rejected by the
Americans, the latter deeming it es
sential that the present negotiations,
already greatly protracted, should be
brought to an early definite conclusion,
now begged to present a new proposi
tion embodying the concession, which,
for the sake of -eace, their Government
would, under the circumstances, be
willing to tender.
The Government of the United States
Is unable to modify the proposal here
tofore made for the cession of the entire
archipelago of the Philippines, but the
American Commissioners are author
ized to offer to Spain, in case the ces
sion should be agreed to, the sum of
$20,000,000, to be paid in accordance with
the terms fixed with the treaty of
peace. It being the intended policy of
the United States to maintain in the
Philippines an open door to the world's
commerce, the American Commission
ers are prepared to Insert in the treaty
now in contemplation a stipulation to
the effect that, for a term of years,
Spanish ships and merchandise shall be
admitted into Philippine ports on the
! same terms as American ships and
i merchandise.
The American Commissioners are
also authorized and are prepared to in-
Bert in the treaty in connection with
the cession of territory by Spain to the
United States a provision for the mu
tual relinquishment of all claims for
indemnity, national and individual, of
every kind, of the United States against
Spain, and of Spain against the United
States that may have arisen since the
beginning of the late Cuban insurrec
tion and prior to the conclusion of the
treaty of peace.
Next followed the terms nearest ap
proaching to a formal ultimatum to
Spain:
"The United States Commissioners
express the hope that they may receive
from the Spanish Commissioners on or
before Monday, the 28th inst., definite
and final acceptance of the proposals
made as to the Philippines in connec
tion also with the demands as to Cuba,
Porto Rico and the other Spanish
Islands of the West Indies and Guam,
in the form in which these demands
have been provisionally agreed to. In
this event it will be possible for the
joint commission to continue its ses
sions and proceed to the consideration
and adjustment of' other matters, in
cludingthose which, as subsidiary and
incidental to the principal provisions,
should form part of the treaty of
peace." ,
It was at this juncture that the
Americans notified the Spaniards that
they desired to treat of the religious
freedom of the Carolines, as agreed to
twelve years ago; also of the release of
political prisoners now held by Spain
in connection with the insurrections in
Cuba and the Philippine Islands; also
of the taking over of the islands of Ku
saie, or Ualan, In the Carolines, for a
telegraphic and naval station; also of
cable station rights at other points in
Spain's jurisdiction; also of the renewal
of certain treaties previously in force
between the United States and Spain,
and which may have lapsed or been
vitiated by war.

REPORTED RESIGNmTION
OF COMMISSIONER RIOS
It Causes Sensational Articles to Be
Published in the Washington
Newspapers.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 21.â 1n conse-
quence of the report from Paris that
Senor Rios, president of the Paris con
ference, had withdrawn and that this
indicated a rupture of negotiations, the
Washington papers were to-night filled
with all kinds of warlike matter, but
there is no occasion for these alarm
ing reports of a probable renewal of
hostilities.
The Call correspondent was informed
by a member of the Cabinet to-night
that Senor Rios' res'gnation, if it took
place, did no-t Indicate the discontinu
ance of negotiations for peace and that
Spain would appoint his successor on
the conference commission.
It is surmised that Senor Rios' resig
nation may have been tendered because
he foresees disagreement and, owing
to the condition of affairs in Spain at
this time, did not wish to be held even
in part responsible for her humiliation
which, in his opinion, is bound to fol
low her relinquishment of sovereignty
over the Philippines.
JAMES ALVA WATT ACCUSED
OF ACCEPTING A BRIBE
FROM MOSES H. SHERMAN
Sensational Developments in the Scandalous
History of the People's Home
Savings Bank.
Alleged Crime Committed to Secure the Appointment
of J. F. Sheehan as Receiver of
the Institution.
The â¢onspirators who ruined the Pa
cific Bank and the People's Home Sav
ings Bank and their confidential ad
visors who assisted them in the de
struction of the institutions were good
and prolific letter writers. In its ex
pose of the wrecking of the banks The
Call has produced many sensational
letters, but it will discuss this morn-
Ing an epistle perhaps more sensa
tional than the others. The Call has
shown over the signature of Dr. R. H.
McDonald and in the handwriting of
his sons that the McDonald family,
while they controlled the McDonald
banks, were thieves. Moses H. Sher
man has proved to the people of this
city over his own signature that he is
a, corrupter of public officials, a briber
of City Councils and the debaser of
Bank Commissioners.
The Call has also in its possession a
letter in which /Moses H. Sherman is
accused of having paid four thousand
dollars to J. Alva Watt of this city for
Ith i , appoint meat ,<& .; John F. Sheehan as .:
the receiver of th People's Home Sav
ings Bank. The letter i- In which this
sensational accusation was made par
ticularizes every detail of the alleged
transaction even to the time and place
when it is charged the money was paid.
The history of the events which led up
to this alleged crooked deal between
the Los Angeles manipulator and the
attorney are of grave moment. Sher
man has already shown himself not
only of being capable of such a trans
action, but, according to his own as
sertion and boasts, of having been
party to similar deals.
There is absolute proof that when the
People's Home Savings Bank, failed
Moses H. Sherman was deeply involved
financially in the bank. Mixed in the
affairs of the institution were very
valuable interests of his own. Durins:
his 'manipulation of the Pacific Bank
and the People's Home Savings Bank
he had given some valuable properties
as security for heavy loans made to
him. He had placed upon the bonds of
his worthless Phoenix investments his
own indorsement which made him per
sonally responsible for the repayment
of the money he had obtained. This
meant to Mr. Sherman an aggregate
loss of, a sum of money of at least 5200,-
000, and he plotted with every energy
he possessed to control the liquidation
of the People's Home Savings Bank.
There Is absolutely no question that
Sherman determined to dictate every
Incident In the final close of these
banks. He had been the principal fac
tor in ruining both banks, and he was
so deeply Interested financially that he
Intended to lose no trick In winding up
the institutions which he had ruined.
To do this he had to control the At
torney General, the Bank Commission
ers, the receiver and the board of di
rectors of the defunct institutions. His
one great purpose was to nullify the
effect of every good security he had
given and to release himself from the
heavy financial obligations und?r which
he had placed himself to the People's
Home Savings Bank during th-> years
that he had induced the manager and
directors of the bank to loan him such
tremendous sums of money.
After the People's Home Savings
Bank failed Sherman found that It was
not as easy as he expected to control
the action of the directors. He has al
ready shown in one of his letters, writ
ten as late as January 10, 1894, that he,
was very far from the accomplishment
of his dishonest purpose. His frantic
letter in which he declared his fear
that he could not control the directors
of the People's Bank has already been
published. His dread that the Grand
Jury would indict him and that the di
rectors of the People's Bank would
compel him to pay his just obligations
drove him practically crazy.
No better evidence than his own let
ter is needed to prove that at that time,
only three months before tbe appoint
ment of a receiver, he was still schem
ing in desperation to protect himself
from the consequences of his own con
spiracy. The People's Home' Savings
Bank had passed through a series of
exciting events since the failure of the
institution. There was still some hope
that the bank might be reopened upon
an honest, sound financial basis. Con
ference after conference was held and
the Attorney General and the Bank
Commissioners determined to make a
more thorough investigation than had
already been instituted. There were
many reasons for this action. In the
first place the j-ttorney General was
still favorably disposed toward the Mc-
Donalds, who still had some hopÂ© of
retaining control ol tho bani. Slier.
man was fighting to keep his clutch
upon the defunct institution and he
still had tremendous influence with the
Bank Commissioners. It was natural
to suppose that he would take one of
two courses that were open to him.
He could first attempt if he chose to
reopen the bank and thus conceal his
enormous indebtedness to the institu
tion. If the bank were reopened
through the efforts of the Bank Com
missioners and the Attorney General
Sherman's victory would be won with
out any unnecessary expense or public
scandal. A second course was still
open to Sherman if it became inevitable
that the People's Home Savings Bank
must go into liquidation. If this con
tingency arose, and it seemed highly
probable, Sherman intended to control
the liquidation and thus protect him
self from the repayment of the enor
mous sum of money that he had bor
rowed or of the sacrifice of the valuable
securities that he had pledged.
It was thus palpable that Sherman
had tremendous interests to protect and
an Imperative reason to demand the
control and manipulation of the bank.
In the letter that The Call has In its
possession the statement is made that
Sherman explained his predicament
and announced his intention to control
the receiver and his attorney if a re
ceiver had to be appointed. When At
torney peneral Hart and the Bank
Commissioners decided to make a more
thorough investigation of the affairs of
the People's Home Savings Bank to
determine whether or not the institu
tion could be reopened upon a sound
and solvent basis they looked around
for a disinterested and capable person
to make the necessary investigation of
the affairs of the bank.
This person was General "Warfleld,
who had had considerable experience
in banking affairs and was then lessee
of the Baldwin Hrrtel. "When the Bank
Commissioners came to their conclusion
great excitement prevailed in the public
mind over the affairs of the bank.
Squabble after squabble had taken
place and many a transaction that
would not bear scrutiny had intensified
the public's feeling against every one
connected with the bank. When War
field agreed to accept the duty of mak
ing an investigation of the affairs of
the bank he deemed it necessary to pro
vide himself with a bodyguard. The
incident occasioned considerable inter
est at the time. After Warfield had
concluded hfs investigation of the as
sets of the People's Home SaviDgs
Bank the Bank Commissioners and At
torney General Hart determined to
force the institution into liquidation.
This meant, as already Indicated, the
appointment of a permanent receiver.
The days of the existence of the bank
were over. The only duty that re
mained was to wind up its affairs and
pay its depositors and creditors what
ever amount of money the assets could
bring. As already described, Moses H.
Sherman was determined to control the
liquidation of this bank. He did not
care who was appointed receiver as
long as the receiver would accept the
dictation of Sherman* and protect Sher
man in his dishonest scheme to evade
the payment of his Just obligations to
the bank. Sherman wished particularly
to control the actions of the attorney
who would act for the receiver.
The wily schemer of Los Angeles be
lieved that he could ? not control War
field, who was then temporarily acting,
and was the candidate, of W. H. H.
Hart for the permanent receivership.
Sherman did not care who the receiver
â¢was with the exception that it was not
Warfield. This in outline was the con
dition of affairs up to the ; time of the
incidents that are described in every
detail in the letter which is now in the
possession of The Call. * .
The writer of this letter declares that
in the latter part of April. 1894. J. Alva
Watt came to him. understanding that
he had :at that time considerable in
fluence in the affairs of the " People's
Home Savings Bank, and asked him to
use his influence so that Watt could se
cure the appointment as ' attorney to
the receiver. Aftef some discussion of
the matter the writer declares that he
gave Watt distinctly to understand
that If he were appointed attorney he
must guarantee to , protect the varied
. interests of MoSea H. Sherman In the
People's Home Savings Bank. The let
ter continues, asserting that Watt gave
the necessary promise, and the writer
of the letter then conferred with Sher
man. - The result of this' conference, so
the letter reads, was that Watt and the
writer again met and Watt was V as
sured -. that 'Ifâ¢ ho could name a service-
Able man as â  receiver that man would
â  . â  -. . â  â¢ â  â  â â¢ r
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
be chosen and Watt would be made his
attorney.
This arrangement seemed perfectly
satisfactory at the time, but apparently
was unsatisfactory a few hours later.
The writer of the letter declares that
Watt came to him and told him in con
sternation that in order to secure the
appointment of his man as receiver It
would be necessary for him to obtain
$5000, with which to "fix" the Judge.
Having received Watt's startling
announcement, the writer of the letter,
which is now in the possession of The
Call, declares that he held another
conference with Moses H. Sherman,
who, after the nqjgnta\,*nd physical tor*
ture which accompanied every demand
made upon him for money, agreed to
give $4000 and no more. Sherman, as
already described by The Call in its
expose, invariably insisted on striking
a bargain even if it were a bargain to
bribe. The startling letter In which
these serious allegations are made next
asserts that late that evening, on the
last day of April, r;Â»4, in a room at the
Baldwin Hotel, J. Alva Watt Avas In
troduced to Moses H. Sherman, and thÂ«
writer of the letter left the room.
Shortly afterward it is alleged Watt
left Sherman's apartments and the
writer of the letter returned. Sherman,
it is alleged, then told him that he had
paid the money to Watt for the pur
pose indicated by the attorney and
with the payment of $4000 in green
backs another deal had been consum
mated. He declared subsequently that
Watt afterward demanded $2000 for his
own services. In conjunction with this
most extraordinary affair the testimony
of several people is of very greai im
portance.
Th# records of the court show that
a few hours after the alleged transac
tion took place between Moses H. Sher
(man and J. Alva Watt, in a room at
the Baldwin Hotel, John F. Sheehan
was appointed permanent receiver of
the People's Home Savings Bank. The
ajjeged deal between Sherman and the
attorney, It is claimed, was not con
cluded until after midnight on April
30, 1894. The following morning when
the complaint of the Attorney General
was called for hearing in court the an
nouncement was made that Sheehan
had been appointed. This announce
ment came as a bombshell to Attorney
General Hart and General Warfleld. It
had been understood that General
Warfleld was to be appointed the re
ceiver. Shortly after he and Hart en
tered thp courtroom Hart, so Warfield
claims, approached the Judge's seat
and engaged him in a whispered con
versation. In a .few moments Hart re
turned and motioned Warfield to go
outside of the courtroom for a few mo
ments.
Hart then told Warfleld that John F.
Sheehan and not Warfleld had been ap
pointed receiver, and that some crooked
work was done. Soon after the appoint
ment of John F. Sheehan as receiver
of the People's Home Savings Bank
James Alva Watt was appointed at
torney for the receiver at a salary of
$500 a month.
THE JUDGE AND
THE RECEIVER
Hebbard Tells How Sheehan
Was Appointed to the
Place;
Judge Hebbard was Judge of Depart
ment No. 4 of. the Superior Court when
the complaint for the appointment of
a receiver for the People's Home Sav
ings Bank came up. It was assigned to
him and he appointed the receiver. Hi 3
story of the events of the appointment
is as follows: :
. "Some days before the question of a
receiver was brought before me I met
Colonel Kowal3ky on the street and
he asked me whom I was going to ap
point as referee in the People's Home
Savings Bank. I said I had not con
sidered the matter and then, he asked
me to name General Warfleld, as in
case Warfield was appointed he would
get the , attorneyship. " I made no defi
nite reply and nothing more was said.
A day or so after General Hart came
into my court with 'an order appointing
a receiver which he wished me to : fill
out and' sign. He said he would like to
have General Warfield appointed, but
I told him the receiver was a man
â¢whom I was in a way responsible for
and v I wanted to put in a man 1I 1 knew.
I - told him General Sheehan had done
excellent service in the Emeric-Alvara
do cuae and X knew him to be a. com2
petent man and I would appoint him.
Hart said that w:is all right; that
Sheehan was a pood man and he was
willing to let him have the place.
"] elgrned the order after Sheehan's
name had been filled in. It was then
about noon.
"That same afternoon I saw Alva
Watt. He sroke to me about the re
ceivership and asked me to appoint
ral WarflelcL He said if I ap
pointed Warfield ho would get the po
sition of attorney. I told him Ko
walsky had made the same statement
to me and he said Kowalsky was
wrong; -at he was to get the job. It
was then I told him I had appointed
Sheehan. Watt never knew of the ap
pointment until some hours after it had
been mnde.
â fie then asked me if I would not
make him the receiver's attorney. I
referred him to Sheehan, saying that
. matter for the receiver to settle
himself and that if he was agreeable to
Sheehan he was agreeable to me. I be
lieve this was in the Union I-eag-ue
< iub rooms and if I am not mistaken
an was there at the time. 1 think
Watt hunted him up and in a few
ea returned to me and told mo it
all right. Sheehan himself fol
lowed him. He confirmed what Watt
had said.
â¢'That night, I think it was, I ac
. Sheehan's bond. His bondsmen
Dan Cole and Pan Burns. The
tment and the
I all on the same day-
May 1, 1894.
â¢"I never had any dealings with Watt
ne else about this case. I
never even allowed Watt or Sheehan
any compensation. 1 told Sheehan at
the time erf his appointment that it was
not at all certain he would get any
money for his work and that any way
â  k to me for it. What, vei
:om the direc- j
f the bank and what money was
allowed his attorney, Mr. Watt, was
also allowed through the directors. My
only reasi appointing Sheehan
were that he had done good work in
arado case, which was
mo, and he was a son-in-law of
Judge Wallace who at that time I
thought was my friend."
The complaint upon which the re
ceiver was appointed was filed by the
Attorney General for the people of the
State on the relation of W. H. Knight
J. B. Fuller, at that time Bank
Commissioners. It declared that the
People's Home Bank was in a state of
confusion and that there was urgent
â  one with authority to
: of the affairs of the institu
attend to its business.
Mike O'Connor, who was clerk of De
nt 4 at the time Sheehan was ap
pointed, has no recollection of the ap
pointment, but he n-members going
down to the Union League Club one
evening in company with Judge Heb
baad. Sheehan and Watt and waiting
until Dan Burns came in, when a bond
was drawn up, accepted by the Judge
and signed by him as a deputy county
clerk.
WARFIELD TELLS
WHAT HE KNOWS
The General Recalls How Shee
han Got the Receivership
Ahead of Him.
General R. H. Warfield, who was
asked by the Bank Commissioner and |
Attorney-General Hart to accept the j
receivership of the People's Home Bank I
and was turned down lsy Judge Heb- ;
bard, gave the details of his limited !
connection with the wrecked institution
to a Call reporter. He said:
"I cannot remember the exact dates,
but the incidents I am about to relate
occurred a short time after the failure
of the Pec-pie's Home Bank. 1 was then
manager of the Baldwin Hotel. One I
afternoon Attorney General Hart came
to me and said that he and the Bank
Commissioners were greatly worried
over the affairs of the defunct bank,
and that they were anxious to secure i
the services of an experienced banker j
as receiver. He asked me if I would j
take charge and close up the business. \
I replied that Mr. Baldwin's consent i
would first be necessary. The Attor- j
ney General went with me to Mr. Bald- j
win and laid the matter before him.
Mr. Baldwin readily gave his consent,
at which Mr. Hart appeared greatly
pleased.
"At that time thousands of excited
depositors were assembled in front of I
the bar.k and General Hart felt some j
hesitancy about going over there, and 1 j
he expressed his fears to me. Not
knowing the exact condition of affairs I
telephoned to Dave Xagle and he came j
to the hotel. Nagle. Hart and I then j
went to the bank and no one offered to ;
molest us.
"I made a cursory examination of the
books, after which Attorney General
Hart asked me to give him an estimate
on the cost of winding up the business. I
I figured that the outside expense
ought not to exceed $1200 a month for
the first two or three months and about i
$500 a month thereafter. This estimate I
seemed to surprise the Bank Commis- j
sioners when Mr. Hart reported to i
them. In a subsequent interview I j
g-aVe a detailed plan how this result
could be achieved.
"The day following this Interview (
with Hart Bank Commissioner Fuller j
came to me and assured me that the
commission was a unit in favor of my

QUAY, HIS SON AND
OTHERS INDICTED
Charged With CoQspiracy to Un
lawfully Use Public Money iQ
tf)e People's Ban^.
PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 21.â The Grand Jury to-day presented to
the County Court true bills of indictment against United States Sen
ator M. S. Quay, his son Richard R. Quay and ex-State Treasurer
Benjamin Haywood, all charged with conspiracy to unlawfully use
public moneys deposited in the People's National Bank of this city
for the purchase and sale of stocks and for other purposes not au
thorized by law. John S. Hopkins, former cashier of the People's
Bank, now dead, is nameu as a party to the conspiracy.
Subsequ : to the presentation of the Indictments District Attor
ney Graham appeared in court and asked for permission to with
draw the attachments obtained for the appearance before the Grand
Jury of Cashier William Montgomery of the Allegheny National
Bank of Pittsburg and Cashier Steph9n B. Stone of the Beaver De
posit Bank of Beaver, Pa.
The District Attorney stated that he had desired to present to the
Grand Jury through the two cashiers named certain evidence in the
suit against Senator Quay and others, but as this matter had now
passed out â¢â¢" the hands of the Grand Jury their presence would not
be needed until the case was brought to trial. He intimated that
he would -then demand their appearance as witnesses and would also
Insist upon the* production of certain books and papers of those
banks.
The court granted the District Attorney's request and the attach
ments for the cashiers were ordered canceled.
The true bills returned by the Grand Jury are five In number.
The first charges M. S. Quay with conspiring with John S. Hopkins
for unlawful use of the money of the People's Bank in the purchase
and sale of the stocks of various corporations for the account,
benefit and profit of M. S. Quay.
The second indictment charges M. S. Quay with conspiring with
John S. Hopkins to unlawfully buy and sell stocks, knowing that the
said Hopkins was cashier of the People's Bank.
<The third indictment charges Benjamin J. Haywood, M. S. Quay
ami Richard R. Quay with conspiracy to convert to their own uses
$100,000 of th public money of the State on December 1, 1896, when
Haywood was the State Treasurer of Pennsylvania and also with
the use of the $100,000.
The fourth bill charges M. S. Quay and Benjamin J. H: ywood
with conspiracy, together with John S. Hopkins, William Livsay, Wil
liam B. Hart, Henry K. Boyer, John W. Morrison, Samuel M. Jack
son and Charles H. McKee, on March 28, IS9B, unlaw. .ly to use and
did use to make profit certain large sums of public money of the
commonwealth which had been deposited in the People's Bank by
the several State treasurers. Of those named Messrs. Quay, Liv
say, Hart, Boyer, Morrison, Jackson and Haywood had been State
Treasurers, succeeding each other in the order named. -â¢
The nfth and last bih charges Benjamin J. Haywood as State
Treasurer with unlawfully loaning $100,000 of State money, which it
is alleged went to Richard R. Quay, and also with receiving pecu
niary benefit from the deposit of State money in the People's Bank.
M. 6. Quay, with his son, Richard R. Quay, arrived here from
San Lucie, Fla., to-day, to which place they went over a week ago.
They declined to discuss the indictments 'found against them. They
were for some time closeted with their counsel. It is probable they
will appear in court to-morrow to plead to the charges contained in
the indictments and, as District Attorney Graham will press for an
immediate trial, there is likelihood of the case being called for trial
on Wednesday.
appointment as receiver. The next day
I think it was, anyway only a few
hours elapsed, the entire commission,
with Attorney General Hart, called at
the "hotel and asked me to be prepared
to go to Judge Hebbard's court the
following morning. At the appointed |
time I went with the gentlemen to the
City Hall, confidently expecting to be
immediately appointed as receiver of i
the savings bank.
"We went into Judge Hebbard's j
courtroom. Attorney General Hart ;
held a short consultation with the i
Judge and then returned to where I j
was sitting. He said to me: "Come into
the other room. We've got to talk this
over.' We wont to the Judge's cham
bers and as soon as the door eloped !
Hart said: 'Something has happened ;
here that I don't understand. Judge J
Hebbard has "'ready appointed Gen- 1
eral John F. Sheehan as receiver of the
People's Bank.' The Bank Commis- j
sioners seemed greatly surprised and i
expressed their inability to comprehend ]
Judge Hebbard's action in refusing to |
appoint me, as I was the choice of the |
whole commission. That ended my con- j
nection with the Bank Commissioners j
and the People's Home Savings Bank, j
I said I had no complaint to make and |
returned to my duties at the hotel.
"I do not know why Judge Hebbard I
substituted General Sh^ehan for me."
JUDGE HEBBARD
CONTRADICTED
Attorney James Alva Watt
Says He Did Not Urge Any
One for Receiver.
James Alva Watt, -who acted as at
i torney for Receiver Sheehan and the
' People's Home Savings Bank, em
phatically denies that he in any way
', sought to have Sheehan appointed. Mr.
' Watt authorizes the following inter
view:
"Any statement or any letter which
says I asked for or received any sum
of money from any person or persons
! connected with the People's Home or
; Pacific Banks, said money to be used
I either directly or indirectly for the pur-
J pose of influencing Judge Hebbard in
appointing a receiver favorable to any
j one interested in the banks, does me a
gross injustice lind is a wicked, vil
lainous He.
"I never received $4000 or any sum of
! money from M. H. Sherman, directly
or indirectly. I never handled any
money in this or any other case except
for legitimate purposes."
Replying to a question Mr. Watt said
Judge HebbardljHaa mistaken in saying
that he (Watt) urged the appointment
of General Warfleld as receiver, and
that he CWatt) would be Warfleld's at
: torney. Mr. Watt's words are:
â¢'I do not wish to contradict Judge
Hebbard, but he is certainly mistaken.
I did not ask him to appoint General
' Warfield nor did I tell him I was to be
; Warfleld's attorney if he was put in
! charge of the bank's affairs. The
i Judge is again mistaken when he says
I I requested him to have myself ap
' pointed attorney for the receiver. I do
1 not remembov having had any conver
sation with Judge Hebbard regarding
j the receivership until after the appoint
! ment of General Sheehan. My recollec
[ tion.of the incidents relating to this
! appointment and the way I became at
i torney for the receiver and the bank is
' somewhat uncertain, but is substan
tially as follows:-^.
"I received the first Intimation of
General Sheehan's appointment from
! him. I was at homo, sick, and did not
! come down town in the forenoon of the
' day the appointment was made. Short
,ly after noon General Sheehan tele
phoned me, asking me to come down
| town as he wished to see me on im
j portant business. I do not remember
THE SAN FBA^CISCO CAIX, TUESDAY, ISrOVEMBER 22, 1898.
. whether he told me then or when I
met him at the Union League Club of
his appointment. Anyway, we met Â«,t
the club and he told me about his ap
pointment and requested me to prepare
his bonds.
"I went to my office, prepared the
bonds and returned to the Union
League. Sheehan had arranged for
sureties, they were present and signed
the bonds. I then Went to a notary
I and secured the acknowledgments to
j the necessary affidavits. It was then
; late in the afternoon and we knew
Judge Hebbard had left his chambers.
In the evening we met the Judge and
he approved the bonds. I had abso
| lately nothing to do with securing the
| appointment of General Sheehan and
; my appointment as his attorney was
| unsought. Since that date I under
1 stand that the receiver consulted with
. his Honor and mv name was suggested
|by Sheehan. This was satisfactory to
the Judge and I took charge of the
j legal questions involved.
"At the time the receiver was ap
i Pointed I did not know M. H. Sherman
| and dfd not meet him until weeks after
i ward. I had only a bowing asquaint
; ance with A. F. Johns and was on un
| friendly terms with Dorn & Dorn and
j the McDonalds.
"As attorney I acted for both the
bank and the receiver, and my compen
sation was fixed by the directors of the
institution weeks after I had begun
work. The legal services rendered by
me were worth all I received and more.
The propriety of my acting in the dual
capacity of attorney fc-r the bank and
j the receiver was questioned at the time
| by Delmas & Shortridge, the attorneys
for the McDonald board of directors.
The matter was carried to the Supreme
Court and I was sustained at every
point. The report of this case Is found
in 104 Cal., 249."

Are Fined.
MUST WORK OUT'THE TIME
HARDSHIPS OF THE PENAL CON
TBACT SYSTEM.
Additional Deaths Among the Volun
teers in Camp on the Hawaiian
Islands â Woman Aged
Over 127 Dies.
BY HORACE WRIGHT.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
HONOLULU, Nov. 14.â The trial of
the Croation laborers who struck from
work on the Oahu plantation is drag
ging its weary length along. So far only
three out of the sixty-three have been
tried, and each was found guilty of vio
lating his labor contract by refusing
to work. They were ordered to return
to work, and on declining to do so were
fined the customary amount, $3 20.
They refused to pay the fine, and were j
sent to jail to work it out at the rate
of 50 cents a day. So far they main
tain that they will not return to the
plantation to labor, but prefer to spend
their lives in prison working on the
roads as they are cumulatively fined for
refusals to labor. The remaining sixty
are to be tried in batches of ten. The
trial is necessarily slow, as the proceed
ings have to be translated from Croa
tian into Hawaiian by the way of Ger
man and English. The poor men are
sorely handicapped, for not only is
their own Consul connected closely in
business with the plantation, but they,
being poor, cannot employ "fighting"
counsel, and have furthermore the
united press, except the little Inde
pendent, on the side of the planters and
against them, while the plantation
counsel is ex-Minister Hatch. The only
hope the poor laborers have is that
their position may be called to the at
tention of the Austrian Government
by friends, and that the United States
Government will cause the wiping
away of the nefarious penal contract
system. While that system is Hawaii's
ruling law, although the American flag
flies over us, the Judges, whatever may
be their sympathies, must enforce it.
It is only necessary for the prosecuting
counsel to prove the contract and the
fact that the men refused to work and
they are railroaded to a fine of $3 20 for
the first offense and $5 for the second, j
and so forth at an increasing rate. If i
they work out these lines, then at the i
expiration of tHeir three years' con- \
tract they have to work out for the j
plantation the number of days they i
have spent in prison or on the roads, j
So far these men have not proved any \
gross cruelty, which, of course, would]
be partially taken into account in their j
defense, but they complain of general
ill-treatment in many minor ways and
especially in the non-fulfillment of
promises as to their accommodations
and comforts. Of course, the planters
claim that these men are merely hew
ers of wood and drawers of water from
the destiny of birth, and their wages
are far higher than they could ever
gain in their own country and their
home comforts of a better character,
but the men don't regard their situa
tions from the same point of view.
After divorcing themselves from
feudalized Europe they feel more like
freemen under the banner of liberty J
and clamor for equal rights with other j
white men. They object to being j
classed as coolie serfs and half slaves.
It is quite possible, but not yet proved,
that labor agitators, speaking their
own language, have been at work
among them, for there are one or two
openly avowed socialistic-anarchist
new-comers in town who haye essayed j
to call meetings, to which no response
was made.
Unless something is promptly done
we shall be flooded with Japanese con
tract men before our American laws
come into operation.

BELEW ESTATES
IN CONTENTION
Objections to Their Dis
tribution.
FINE LEGAL POINTS RAISED
FRANKLIN'S HEIBS MAY PROFIT
BY HIS CRIME.
Interesting Arguments and Cita
tions Before the Supe
rior Court of Solano
County.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SUISUN, Nov. 21.â The petition for
the distribution of the estate of Susie
and Louis Belew, deceased, came up
for hearing in the Superior Court at
Fairfleld to-day on the objection of
Arthur Belew to the distribution of any
portion of the estates to Franklin Be
le'w's estate, interposed by Attorney
Robbins for Arthur Belew last week.
The objection was based on the grounds
that Franklin Belew having murdered
his sister and brother willfully and for
the purpose of inheriting part of their
estates could not under the law inherit
from them, relying mainly upon a New
York case â Ellerton vs. Westcott et al.,
Court of Appeals, New York, January
7, 1896.
To sustain his contention Attorney
O. R. Coghlan, representing Reese
Clark, the attorney who defended
Franklin Bolew for the murder, and
who holds a mortgage on Franklin
Belew's interest In the estates of Susie
and Louis Belew, raised the points that
the statute of distributions fixed the
line of succession to estates and that
courts are bound by that statute and
cannot interpolate into it any provision
not therein contained; that that statute
being plain and unambiguous leaves
xÂ»o room for construction; that to say
Franklin Belew cannot inher.- because
of his crime is to add additional pun
ishment to what the law fixes for mur
der, which is in contravention of sec
tion 6, article I of the State constitu
tion, which prohibits unusual punish
ment, and also that such an assumption
of power on the part of the court would
be in effect a Judicial bill of attainder,
and to that ci.tent violative of section
16, article I of the California constitu
tion.
He cites cases from North Carolina,
Nebraska, Ohio and Pennsylvania, ap
parently bearing out every particular
of his several contentions. He was
followed by Phil Bruton of Woodland,
Who represents the executors of the
will of Franklin Belew, citing a num
ber of California cases sustaining Mr.
Coghlan'a contentions as to the inter
pretation of the statute.
Mr. Robbins closed the argument,
stating that he relied upon the New
York case. The court took the matter
under advisement, Intimating, how
ever, that his present Judgment was
that he should overrule the objection
to the distribution to Franklin Belew's
estate.
REBELS EITHER SHOT

G-enefal Rios Reports That the Insur

Has Been Suppressed.
LONDON, Nov. 22.â The Madrid corre
spondent of the Daily Mail says: General

ROBERTS OF UTAH MAY BE
EXPELLED FROM CONGRESS
NEW x'ORK Nov 21.â The Washington correspondent of the
Herald telegraphs: Representatives chosen to the next Congress are
much interested In the case of Brigham H. Roberts of Utah regard
ing the treatment he will probably receive vvhen he comes to Wash
ington to take- his seat in the House. Among the mblican eaders
there Is a general disposition to favor unseating him, and as that
party will have the power to carry out this programme it will not be
surprising if he is expelled from Congress. If this is done neither of
Mr. Roberts' opponents will be seated, as there is no question that
he received a plurality of votes and was duly elected. If he is ex
pelled it will be on the broad grounds that by sending him to Con
gress Utah has violated the solemn pledge exacted as a condition
precedent to admission to Statehood, and that his election is an af
front to Congress and the entire nation as a virtual confession that
Utah gave a pledge to abolish polygamy for the purpose of obtaining
admission to the Union and without any intention of observing it.
SUSPECTED OF BEING
IN THE TRAIN ROBBERY
SAN BERNARDINO. Nov. 21â Sheriff
Holcomb arrived this morning from Dag

ing an accomplice of Ignaciu.s Eisler In
Saturday night's train robbery. The pris

work Friday night. He and his compan
ion went to a lodging-hou<?e and rented a
room, leaving a Winchester rifle. Later,
he returned and took the rifle away to
Welch's saloon, stating that he intended

claims that he then got drunk a.nd about
10 o'clock friends had to carry him to the

the car with him and by all of them he
can prove an alibi. Saturday morning he
showed up for work. After working a

heard some Mexicans were threatening

Charopion.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Nov. 21 âWill science
triumph over brute force or vice versa
at the Lenox Athletic Club to-morrow
>\ill Corbett, the idol of ad
rs of scientific boxing methods,
succumb to Sharkey, the ideal rough
and-ready fighter? These were ques
tions heard, asked and answered In the
affirmative and negative by sporting
men to-day. Many good Judges of mat
ters pugilistic are of the opinion that
Corbett's science will earn for him the
right to collect the winner's share of
the $20,000 purse, while equally shrewd
vers say they are convinced that
the sailor pugilist will defeat the man
who won the pugilistic crown from
John L. Sullivan.
That Curbett ought to win over Shar
key is the almost unanimous sentiment
among sporting men. Some there are
â who think the former champion has the
if a task before him,
whereas others while thinking that he
ought to triumph because of the ad
vantages given him by the rules, never
theless are fearful lest his endurance
may not hold out to the end. Still
others, in fact a large majority, believe
that Corbett â  ill not be put to any
severe physical strain, as the chances
are so many in their opinion that as
b "n aa Sharkey receives a good stiff
jab on the bridge of the nose he may

kCdrbettout. Fora big fight
heavy- weights, like Corbett
key, there has been little bet
: Why this apathy is not quite
â  to the casual observer, in
â â¢f th'- fact that Corbett is de
â¢â¢ the favorite with the bulk of
sporting fraternity. Heretofore
tuns of money have been wagered on
the outcome of battles similar to this
one. Many small bets, to be sure, have
been made on this one, but there has
been an almost woeful lack of those
reaching into hundreds or thousands.
This scarcity of big money, however, I
has in no wise decreased the interest in
the fight. It cannot be denied that al
though Corbett money predominates,
many men who have bet heavily on
previous heavy-weight contests have
decided to hold aloof this time. They j
think it would be foolish to take a j
chance on Sharkey with rules so disad- j
vantageous to him and with so many
prospects that he might commit a foul.
Th-n again they are not desirous of |
betting on Corbett, for while reports !
may come from his training quarters j
that he is in excellent condition they
are not certain that his endurance will I
last out.
This is the first time in their career
a? sporting men that many of the big
bettors have failed to put down a wager
on a fist contest of such importance.
Among others is "Jimmy" Wakely, who
said: "For the first time in my life I
will not bet on a big fight. I lost heavily !
on Corbett when he was defeated by
Fitzsimmons, and although under the !
rulfs arranged for this contest with
Sharkey he ought to win, still I shall
not try to recoup my losses. If I felt
sure Jim could stay the distance I
â would have no hesitancy in placing a
large sum on him."
"Dan" Stuart ninde the following bets
on Corbett to-night: $1000 against $800
with "Bob" Hose; $1000 against $750
â¢with "Abe" Levy, and $1000 against
$750 with "Joe" Ullman.
ON THE EVE uF BATTLE
XRW yORK, Nov. 21. â The sporting |
resorts along upper Broadway and â 
throughout the Tenderloin dihtricts
were crowded to-night with pu*i
lists and followers of pugilism who j
have come to the city to witness the i
Corbett-Sharkey fight. Hundreds of j
out-of-town sporting men are locaied ;
at the principal hostelries between
Twenty-third and Forty-second stree'.s
and in the corridors and cafes of a:i
the hotels groups of men stand around j
d'scussmg the probable outcome of tht
st and comparing the relative !
merits of the combatants.
Bach of the principals had plenty of
friends and wagers were made fre- ,
nuently as to the result of the contest.
Corbett had the largest following and
his admirers were not slow to place ;
odds on his chances the moment any '
Bharkey money was flashed. One hun
3red to eighty on Corbett were the pre
lailiug odds and quite a large sum of :
. was placed at that price. Two
bets of $500 at evens were made by |
sanguine Kharkeyites. George Consi
aine and his brother John from De
troit took the Corbett end of both j
a-agers. They looked around for more ,
it this rate, but none was forthcoming ]
and then they offered 100 to SO, getting
several smaller bets at this price.
The Considines are stron- believers
on Corbett's ability to beat the sailor
pugilist and their cafe on Sixth avenue
presented an animated scene up to mid
night. Among those who 4 oUd the
throng were "Honest John" Kelley. who
Is to referee the fight; Dan Stuart,
who bru ght off the Fitzsimn " c . or "
b"tt battle at Carson lr.st year, and a
host of others well known, connected
directly or indirectly with fistiana.
There, as everywhere else they went,
Corbett's friends were in the majority,
but there were always enough Sharkey
followers on hand to hold the sailor's
er 1 up by word or money * â¢. back it.
"Sharkey is tit to fight for his life
and those who think he is not clever
will be surprised when they see him in
the work," said his manager. "His
work in training was done cheerfully
and the result is that his condition to
night is al! that could be desired. He
finished up to-day with light work and
will lest until the appointed hour to
morrow. I can add to what I have al
reai> paid over and over again, that
Sharkey will win and In a most decisive
manner, too."
Corbett's friends were just as confi
dent. "Jim was never in better shape
in his life," said Considine to-night,
"and my friends and myself will back
him for every dollar we can. Our
money is safe. In fact, I look upon it
as cinched."
Charley White, who trained Corbett
for the Carson City fight, has had
charge of the ex-champion's training
since Corbett took up his quarters at
the Lenox Club house. White was very
pronounced in his statements as to Cor
bett to-night, and claimed that the big
fellow would win within fifteen rounds.
THE LOCAL BETTING.
Betting on the Corbett-Sharkey fight
from all appearances will be heavy to
day. Yesterday it opened at Crowley's
poolrooms at even money, but it soon
fell, with Corbett on the long end at
$100 to $90. These figures held until the
evening, when the Corbett people flood
ed "the market" with coin, and the
closing odds were $100 to $60, with
Sharkey on the short end. Johnny
Crowley expects very lively betting to- \
day at the present odds, as large con- j
signments of coin from Vallejo and
Benicia are expected and will be placed i
on Sharkey to win at the prevailing !
odds. At Corbett's the betting is also j
very spirited with the same odds offer- I
cd. Over nine hundred tickets have al- j
ready been purchased in the mutuals ;
as follows: Corbett â 1 to 6, 77; 7to 12,
115; 13 to 17, 107; 18 and over, 226. Shar
keyâl to 6, 62; 7 to 12, 127; 13 to 17,
114; 18 and over, 98.
Considerable coin has also been i
placed at Crowley's by purchasers of
mutual tickets. In the combinations
the odds offered are: Corbett and La- j
vigne, 3 to 2; Corbett and Tracey, 3 to
1; Sharkey and Lavigne, 3 to 1; Sharkey
and Tracey, 4 to 1.
Anticipating an enormous crush in
the two poolrooms already named this
evening, police will be in attendance at
the entrances of the betting rooms to
preserve order.
CHICAGO'S MAYOR
FORBIDS THE BALL
Gorgeous Preparations Had Been

Ever Held in America.
CHICAGO, Nov. 21.â For weeks prep

Armory a bal masque on a scale of mag
nificence never before attempted, it is
said, on this side of the Atlantic. Ten
thousand invitations in the highest style
of the engraver's and lithographer's art
had been scattered broadcast over the
land and acceptances received for fully
half that number, many being from men
and women having sporting blood in
their veins, residing in New York, Cin
cinnati, Louisville. New Orleans, St.
Louis, Omaha, Minneapolis and other cit
ies. The great hall had been decorated
with gorgeousness befitting the occasion.
The best music obtainable had been en
gaged and numerous other expensive ar
rangements undertaken with a view to
making the affair a success. Twenty-five
hundred tickets at $n each were, already
sold. Now comes the Mayor, at the behest
of the reform element, and forbids the
managers of the ball holding the proposed
function. Late to-night he ordered the
Chief of Police to prevent the opening of
the doors of the armory on "Wednesday
night at all hazards. As a result there is
gloom on the levee. The managers

LONGSTREET SO REPORTS
NO REASON WHY UNION AND
CENTRAL CANNOT SETTLE.
In His Annual Report the Commis
sioner Recommends Construction
of a Government Road jfrom
Kansas to San Diego.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 21.â General
James Longstreet, the Commissioner of
Railroads, In his annual report, made
public to-day, calls attention to the
general prosperity In railroad affairs,
and recommends the Government con
struction and operation of a first-class
double-track railway from Kansas
City, Ma., to San Diego, Cal., by air
line route. He sayÃ the physical condi
tion of our railroads generally is better
than ever before. He points to the
spectacle of roads which only two or
three years ago were in receivers'
hands now paying dividends on their
preferred stocks and piling up sur
pluses whic" 'n the course of a very
short time, his report says, will be dis
tributed among the common stockhold
ers. Many roads which, in 1893, were
fcrrced to cut salaries 20 per cent, he
says, have voluntarily restored the old
basis of wages. In April, 1894, receiv
ers controlled in this country 210 roads,
embracing about 20 per cent of the total
mileage. On June 30 of this year there
were only 119 railroads in the hands of
receivers, and General Longstreet pre
dicts that under the present condition
of prosperity within another year the
list of insolvent railroads will be as
small as in the years immediately pre
ceding 1892.
Reporting on his inspection of the
properties of the Union Pacific and Cen
tral Pacific and several of the land
grant lines in the West and on the Pa
cific Slope, this autumn, the Commis
sioner says that substantial improve
ments have been made on the road
beds on the main lines, wooden bridges
replaced by iron and steel and the bal
lasting is more extensive and much im
proved. He recommends a Government
air line transcontinental route in the
following language:
The annexation of the Hawaiian Isl
ands, the possible, probable control of the
.Philippine and Ladrune Islands, must
open up new trade relations of such
growing proportions with them as to so
materially increase the business of all
the bond-aided roads as to be well within
the scope of reason to anticipate their
ability, at an early date, to pay principal
Â«tnd interest of their debt to the I'nited
States.
These new eastern acquisitions, with
Cuba and Porto Rico, producing trop
ical products, our annual demand for
-which is to the extent of $225,000,000,
about one-third of our entire imports will
in a few years be entirely furnished from
these new possessions, and our products
taken in exchange, while now our ex
ports to these islands, I believe, do not
exceed $15,000,000 annually.
Heretofore, under former sway, every
effort . has been made to discourage busi
ness intercourse with Americans. Under
the new order of things in these islands
every effort will be made to encourage
trade with us, and when the population
is doubled in numbers and is increased
ten times in ability to produce and con
sume, which is not an unreasonable an
ticipation, what then will our trade
amount to? It is almost Impossible to
imagine. Less than 5,000,000 British
colonists In Australasia exchange prod
ucts to the amount of $650,000,000 annually.
It is only reasonable to suppose that in a
few years the trade with our new pos
sessions will fully equal If not surpass
this, and the United States must control
the bulk. Furthermore, the vast volume
of wheat and other cereals which now
find their way from the middle western
grain prairies to Asia and other countries
of the Western Hemisphere via the At
lantic seaports will, in a very few years
reach these same destinations via Paci
fic seaports, and with this changed con
dition will come vastly increased ton
nage and revenues to all the transconti
nental lines.
11^* 1810111 81011 of tnls very traffic on
this idea is now receiving the careful at
tention and consideration of the execu
tive and managing officials of some of the
leading lines between Chicago, St. Paul

and the Pacific slope, and therefore it

States has In bond-aided railroads, and
especially in the Central Pacific? should
not be "scaled," but that we have every
reason to look for repayment of dollar for

*v. It Â» may be timely Just now to surest
that the Government construct and op
erate a first-class double-track railroad
from Kansas City to San Diego by air
line route.,, This will open the shortest
line, measured by the map. from Boston,
New York and Philadelphia to the coast
and along the coal fields of the East and
West, this side of the Rocky Mountains,
and making the most direct line from our
great commercial centers to the Sandwich
Islands and the; Philippines. This, with
other lines now working overland, may
prove ample for the wants of commerce
to the Pacific Coast and the Orient hold
ing trade and travel within our borders
pending the . experiment of a canal
through the isthmus.
An overland route from Vera Cruz,
Mexico, to Acapulco, now approaching
completion, may be an important adjunct
to our own overland routes as commerce
increases. . . Â» â¢â â ...â 
The home advantages of an overland
line by the Government will be to draw
the people nearer together in Interests
and sympathies, and will serve them as a
safeguard against the monopoly of cor
porations. As trade increases it may de
velop the Importance of a direct similar
line to Seattle, Wash.
St. Louts is a little south of the direct
line between New York to San Diego, but
the topographical features of the country
indicate that possibly a better route may
be found from that point, and the bridge
over the Mississippi River at that point
may prove an important consideration. A
survey, therefore, by direct line should be
made from each of these points.
The report says of the United States
subsidy bonds under theactsof 1862 and
1864 to aid the Pacific railroads' con
struction, there have matured $50,618,
592, of which $50,489,952 have been re
deemed and paid out of the treasury,
leaving still due and unpaid $129,000.
The remaining bonds of this Issue fall
due as follows: Union Pacific, January
1, 1899, $3,157,000; Central Pacific, same,
$9,197,000; Western Pacific, same, $1,650,

Secret Negotiations During William's
Absence From Germany That

Alliances.
BDeclal Dispatch to The CalL
PARIS, Nov. 21.â 1t was quite unex
pectedly announced this afternoon that
a commercial treaty has been con
cluded between France and Italy,
granting mutually favored treatment
except for silk goods, which will re
main subject to the maximum tax. A
bill embodying the agreement will be
submitted immediately to the Chamber
of Deputies.
The Government also Introduced a
bill in the Chamber to-day modifying
the wine duties favorably to Italy.
The negotiations that have culmi
nated in these arrangements have been
on foot for two years, but nobody be
lieved that a definite agreement was
pending.
It is believed that the Fashoda affair
was instrumental in inducing France
to grant the necessary concessions,
though it is noteworthy that the silk
duties, which caused the breaking of
the treaty in 1887, remain almost un
changed. The negotiations have been
conducted with the utmost secrecy. The
effect of the concessions involved is not
yet known, but it is expected that they
will have an important pclitical influ
ence for the removal of a long-stand
ing friction between the two countries.
The treaty, it Is noticed, was con
cluded during the absence of Emperor
William from Germany, and there is
much speculation regarding its prob
able results upon the European alli
ances. ____________
ALARMING GROWTH OF
SALVADOR'S REVOLT
May Involve All Five Central Ameri
can States in a General
Conflagration.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted. 1898. by James Gor
don Bennett.
PANAMA, Nov. 21.â Late advices from
Salvador via Nicaragua indicate that the
revolt Is more serious than first thought.
It may involve all five States In a gen
eral conflagration. According to advices,
the real object of the movement is the
overthrow of the Federal republic, which
was organized November 1 at Amapala.
To accomplish this Kegaldos called in the
aid of Guatemala and Costa Rica, who
always viewed the union of Salvador,
Nicaragua and Honduras as a constant
menace to their sovereignty.
The Herald's correspondent says the
rebels are now in possession of all the de
partments with the exception of La Union
and San Miguel, the latter the stronghold
of Horacio VJUavicenico, who 1m a can
didate in opposition to Regalrlos. The
Federal Government is hurriedly mobil
izing its forefs to march against RiÃal
dos. Honduras sends 4000, Nicaragua 4000
and the Federal district of Salvador 2000.
The movement is backed by capitalists
who are well-known military men. Cable
censorship has been established at L.a

LOOKING FOR HEIRS
OF VESTA HASTINGS
State Department Inquiring for the
Legal Representatives of the
Dead Californian.
HARRISBURG. Pa., Nov. 21.â The State
Department at Washington advertised in
Harrisburg Saturday for information as
to the legal representative of Vesta Hast
ings, who died Countess d'Henriot in
Paris on October 30 last. The inference is
that property awaits her heirs.
It developed to-day that Vesta Hastings
was Bonnie Riley to her Harrisburg
friends. She came here in 1573 as a stu
dent in Miss Woodward's seminary. Her
father Is a Californain. Leaving here she
went to Washington and then returned
to her home in California, A few years
later a story floated hither from New
York, in which Vesta Hastings was the
central figure in an apartment house sen
sation, the man with whom she had beon
living causing the trouble. After that she
went to Paris. Two years ago she visited
this country and called on old friends,
whom she told of her marriage to Count
d'Henriot.
MEXICO GIVES UP
CONDUCTOR TEMPLE
And Now He Will Be Tried in Ari

Against Him.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 21.â The case of
the American railroad conductor who has
been held under arrest in Mexico fo: kill
ing a man on this side of the line has
been satisfactorily adjusted. United
States Minister Clayton has reported to
the State Department by telegraph that
the Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs,
Senor Mariscal, had agreed to stop
further proceedings against Temple under
the Mexican law and surrender the man
to the Arizona authorities on extradition
proceedings on Mr. Clayton's statement
that he would be tried in Arizona. The
United StaU-s Government had previously
demanded Temple's release before the de
mand was made for his extradition in or
der to avoid recognizing the Mexican
claim of extra territorial jurisdiction, and
the present outcome ia satisfactory In
that regard.
HUNTER'S CINGULAR FATE.
Bullet Intended for a Coon Proves a
Boomerang.
MILTON, Cal., Nov. 21.â Florian Far
num, a well known resident of Copperop
oUs, was killed on Sunday afternoon near
that place under peculiar circumstances.
A party of young men were out hunting
wild hogs, when Farnum saw a coon and
discharged his rifle at it without effect.
Laying aside his rifle he drew his pistol,
and. climbing on to a large rock, fired
again at the coon. In some way the bul
let struck another rock, and in the recoil
traversed nearly the same course first
taken and buried itself in Farnum's ab
domen. After b^ing shot he descended
from the rock and walked a few steps up
the hill, at the same time telling one of
his companions that he was shot, and
then sank to the ground. He was remov
ed in a wagon to his home, and expired
on arriving there. Farnum was 2G years
of age, married and had one child.

SPANISH GUNBOATS
SHELL SORSOGON
But When the Insurgents Show
Tight the Vessels Hastily
Retreat.
MANILA, Nov. 21.â Passengers who ar
rivod here to-day on the steamer Ade
lante report that two Spanish gunboats
recently visited Sorsogon and fired three
shells into the town, claiming that the

Insurgents showing light, it is added, the,
gunboats left hurriedly. The shells did
little damage.
Sergeant Price of the Minnesota regi
ment, who was stabbed by disorderly
Filipinos on Friday night and who was
reported to have been killed, is still alive.
DR. BENNETT PLEADS POVERTY.
But the San Jose Dentist Must Pay
Alimony.
SAN JOSE, Nov. 21.â Dr. A. G. Bennett.
i prominent in both church and society cir
cles, was before Judge Hyland this after
noon on an order to show cause why he
should not pay his wife alimony pending
the result of the suit for divorce filed by
her. Mrs. Dora Cambers Bennett did
not appear, but her attorney showed by
affidavit that her husband was able to
pay alimony.
Dr. Bennett showed that his pathway
had not been strewn with roses since his
marriage, and that his income has di
minished. He testified that before his
marriage his Income had been from $150
to $200 per month, but since he took unto
himself the responsibility of caring for a
! better half his dental practice had stead
ily decreased. At present It amounted to
not more than $65 per month, which was
not sufficient to pay expenses and was a
clear loss of $30 per month.
The court issued an order for Dr. Ben
nett to pay $50 counsel fees, $20 a month
alimony and costs of suit.
After four short months of married life
the separation of the couple came as sud
denly as their marriage, which savored
of an elopement. The ground on which a
divorce is asked is cruelty.

SILK SKIRTS
ARE TABOOED
Women Decide That
They Must Go.
NOISY RUSTLE THE CAUSE
MINISTERS INDORSE THE WAR
AGAINST THE GARMENTS.
Theatrical Managers Also Glad That
the Nerve-Hackers Are Doomed
and Approve tho
Movement.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Nov. 21.â The silk skirt,
the rustle of which is so dear to the
heart of the wearer, must go, and its
rustle is the cause of it. An item ap
peared in the morning papers setting
forth the fact that the Women's Club
of Atlanta had declared war on the
dainty garment because Its "swish,
swish," as the wearer walked down the
aisle of the lecture hall or church
worked disaster to the nerves of the
male and non-silk-skirt wearing mem
bers of the audience or congregation.
It came to the notice of many minis
ters who attended the regular Monday
meeting of the Ministers' Association,
and in the course of proceedings it was
taken up for discussion. While treated
in a jocular sense by many of the di-
vines present it was unanimously voted
that there was no agency more potent
to disturb divine service than the rus
tling silk skirts of late coming women,
who, sailing toward a seat, distracted
the attention of all present, whether
they were praying, singing or listening
to a sermon, and the action of the At
lanta women was heartily indorsed.
A round among theatrical managers
found them even more opposed to the
nerve-racking garment than were the
preachers. Milward Adams, manager
of the Auditorium, where Grau's song
birds now hold fc-rth nightly, was par
ticularly outspoken.
"It is an outrage," he said, "for la
dies to array themselves in garments
that on the slightest movement of the
wearer produce a sound like that of a
wind machine used on the stage in mel
odrama. It is quite fashionable for la
dies to ctrnie to the opera late, and
hundreds of them are usually being
shown to seats at once during the over
ture. The result is the piano passages
are completely drowned out, and real
music lovers lose their tempers and
much of what they paid money to hear.
Away with silk skirts if that is the
cause of the trouble."
Managers Davis of the Columbia,
Powers of the Powers and Latt of Mc-
Vicker's agreed with Adams, but could
see no way to rid the theater-going
public of the nuisance complained of.
All hoped, however, if attention was
called to it the ladies themselves would
do the right thing, as they had with
the big-hat nuisance.
At the Woman's Club the silk petti
coat was characterized by a prominent
member of the board of directors as a
nuisance. "You would agree with
me," said she, "if you were to attend
one of our meetings. Yc-u can hardly
hear what is going on for the noise of
rustling skirts. However, we do not
contemplate any movement toward
abolishing the silk petticoat habit. The
Woman's Club has never taken a stand
for or against dress reform, except in
regard to the hat. We have done away
with the big hat at the opera, and at
our meetings, but I am sorry to say the
society skirt is still in evidence, and I
see no hope of abolishing it."
TO PREVENT THE
RE-ELECTION^OF GOMPERS
An Important Caucus of Members of
the Federation of Labor to
Be Held.
CHICAGO, Nov. 21.â A caucus having for
itfe object the prevention of the re-election
of Samuel Gompers as President of the
American Federation of Labor and se
curing the adoption of a Socialist platform
by the coming convention at Kansas City
will be held in Chicago December 12. The
prime movers in the calling of the caucus
are the ultra radical and socialistic lead
ers In the federation, assisted by those
who consider they have been ignored by
the federation's present administration.
The only two men prominently men
tioned among the ranks of the opposition
for the presidency are Douglas Wilson,
editor of the official journal of the In
ternational Association of Machinists, and
Harry Lloyd, ex-president of the Brother
hood of Carpenters and Joiners of
America, As James O'Connell, third vice
president of the .federation, is a ma
chinist as well as Wilson, and as two
from the same trade are never elected
officers of the federation at the same
time, Wilson's friends are saying that
O'Connell Is not a good socialist and
should, therefore, not be re-elected, and
consequently are laying plans to take hia
scalp.

DISCUSSES NEEDS OF CUBA
EEE3 NECESSITY FOR AMERI
CAN OCCUPATION.
But Does Not Wish It to Be Perma- j
nent â Longs for the l>awn of
the Island's Free
dom.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Nov. 21.â General Ca
llxto Garcia and the other Cuban Com
missioners from the Cuban Military As
sembly at Santa Cruz del Sur, who are j
en route to Washington for the purpose !
of laying before President McKinley a 'â 
resolution recently adopted by the Aar i
sembly as to the future of the Island of |
Cuba, arrived to-day un the Ward line
steamer Segurancia,
General Garcia and the Commission
ers were given an enthusiastic welcome
by the members of the local branch of
the Cuban Junta and many prominent
Cubans. Garcia, when seen on the
steamer, said:
"I will go to Washington In a day or
two to see the President, and after my
work in the United States is accom
plished I will return to Cuba, The
Cubans have no other feeling for the
Americans than those of friendship and
gratitude. As for myself, 1 believe in
American occupation of Cuba until or
der has been restored. I believe in the
United States having Cuba, but not for
ever. I am for free Cuba, and so are all
other Cubans. There is no sentiment on
the island fur annexation. All Cubans
have faith in Mr. McKinley.
"The commission of which I am the
head is not going to Washington with
any propositions for the President's
consideration. We are going to tell
of the country and to better the ar
rangements for the districts and in
surgent troops, collecting the customs
duties and the establishment of a post
ofnee system. American occupancy is
a necessity â but not forever."
General Garcia also said that at the j
Assembly at Santa Cruz del Sur there I
was the greatest spirit of unity shown. J
lie said that he was In sympathy with
General Butler's plan to employ Cv- j
ban soldiers as police.
"1 believe the plan is a g"ood one," he
aid. "The men could be under the di- !
rection of Cuban colonels, who would I
rep ut to the general. The present plan
is to keep the Cuban soldiers under
arms until the Americans come into a
district and then the Cuban officers in i
the district will offer the services of his j
men to the American officer. Those
who are wanted are retained by the-
American officer and the others are
sent home."
General Garcia said he did not know !
when- the capital of the island would j
uated, nor did he know when th<i
first Presidential election would be
held. He said the evacuation of the
Island was progressing "as slowly ;is '
the Spaniards can do it. They still
hate to give up their customs receipts."
He ih"i_;g:ht the stories of the trouble
with the Snanish soldiers owing to their
salarit:? being in arrears were greatly
exaggerated and that in time what was
hem would be paid. General Gar
cia paid chat there "was still great suf
fering in the towns, the people lacking
food and medicines. In the field, how
ever, the men did not want, as they
were supplied by voluntary contribu
irom the people, which were given
in spi'.e ' need.
He said that he had not heard that
General Gomez had discharged all the
Americans who were acting as officers
of the Cuban arm--, and that he did not
know Gomez was unfriendly to the
Americans.
General Jose Miguel Gomez, who is
not a relative to the commander in
chief, said there was no truth in the
stories that General Gomez was un
friendly to the Americans.
"I received orders from General
Gomez to assist the Americans when
they landed," he said, "and to facilitate
their movements in every way. I did
so, and since then the orders have jiot
been rescinded."

cided - through the medium of the
French Government that the protocol
referring to the evacuation of Cuba
would \*f carried out without molesta
tion on the 'part of American men-of-
war.
Rear Admiral Dewey would send his
vessels to destroy the Spanish fortifi
cations at Iloilo, troops would be trans
ported to that- point and the city would
be occupied. With the fall ut this point
the last Spanish stronghold in the Phil
ippines would have disappeared, and it
would be an easy task to station troops
among the various islands to protect
American interests. Besides the Philip
pines, American men-of-war would also
hoist the flas over the Carolines.
It will be impossible for Spain to pre
vent the United States from carrying
out its will either in the Atlantic or in
the far east. In expectation of the ar
rival of the German Emperor and for
the purpose of impressing him as well j
as the -people of Spain with the size of
the remnant of the Spanish navy. Ad
miral Camara has been directed to
mobilize his ships at Cadiz. There are
now at that point the battleship Pelayo,
armored cruiser Carlos V, protected
cruiser Alfonso XIII, the reconstructed
battleships Xumancia and Vittoria, be
sides torpedo boat cruisers and" tor
pedo boats. In the Philippines Spain
has several, small gunboats and one i
auxiliary cruiser, the Buenos Ayres.
Since the war the Spanish Govern
ment has done nothing toward coi*Â»plet.
ing the armored cruisers of the As
turias class which are under construc
tion, her neglect being: due to lack of
funds. It is because she has no money
and because of her total â¢ unprepared
ness for war that the authorities do
not believe to-night that there will be a
resumption of hostilities, and it is on
account of this belief that no extensive
preparations or plans are being made.

COMPLICATIONS OVER THE
SALE OF SUGAR STOCK
Suit Entered Against the Waialua
Agricultural Company for Spe
cific Peiformance.
HONOLULU, Nov. 14.â Colonel John F.
Soper and E. S. Valentine have entered
suit against B. F. Dillingham and the
Waialua Agricultural Company for spe
cific performance, to declare, a trust and
for an injunction. An injunction served j
on E. D. Tenny, representing the Waialua i
Agricultural Company, has for its pur- I
pose that of staying the issuance of stock
and a second injunction against B. F. I>il- !
lingham enjoins that defendant from dis
posing of stock.
In brief, plaintiffs claim that" Mr. Dil
lingham authorized them to place in San
Francisco $I,OuO/hÂ» of the stock of the
new sugar company; that they did so
and paid into the hands of Welch & Co.
10 per c< nt of the value of the stock as
agreed. Therefore, they are entitled to the
delivery of the stock and the commis
sions promised by B. F. Dillingham.
The bill states that Mr. Dillingham
admits authorizing the sale of the sugar
stock and the commissions, but claims
that Soper did not sell the stock within
the time limit. S'jper and Valentine say
In reply that when the original agree
ment was entered into no time limit was
agreed upon. After they began work
Mr. Dillingham attempted to rix a time, !
which, however, the -plaintiffs declined to
recognize.
The bill further alleges that Mr. Dil
lingham subscribed 34,000 shares of stock
and now refuses to consider the sub
scribers obtained by plaintiff*, and pro
poses to assign the stock to other sub
scribers in Honolulu to . petitioners un
known, and alleges further that the
Waialua Agricultural Company proposes
issuing shares to the subscribers named
by Dillingham and not fb those secured
by the said plaintiffs.
The bill asks that the Waialua Agricul
tural Company be enjoined from issuing
the shares till further order of the court,
and that Mr. Dillingham he also enjoined
from disposing of any of the stock; that
Mr. Dillingham be adjudged a trustee of
the shares of stock In dispute for the
benefit of the subscribers secured by the
plaintiffs and to make over said shares
to such subscribers and to pay the com
mission as agreed upon.

SHIPBUILDERS SAID TO
BE FORMING A TRUST
! Union Iron Works Alleged to Have
Been Represented at a Meet
ing for This Purpose.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 21.â An Ameri- j
j can shipbuilders' trust is already loom- ;
ing up as a result of the war with
Spain. The Navy Department had aj
strong intimation from the shipbuild- \
ers recently that stiffer prices will pre- |
vail in future, and an unmistakable iii- i
I dieation of what is in store has been '
! disclosed at a meeting held in New
York several days ago, when the repre
sentatives of tirms which have contracts
for the obsolete and discredited type of !
f single turret monitors practically
pooled their interests and determined. |
figuratively speaking, to put screws on .
the Government before they got;
through with the job.
T t is the understanding here that
those who took part in tho meeting
were Henry T. Scott of th^ Union Iron
Works, San Francisco, contractors for
the Wyoming; Superintendent Hans
com of the Bath Shipbuilding Works,
contractors for the Conn* leut; Lewis i
Nixon of Elizabeth, N. J.. contractors
for the Florida, and an official of the :
Newport News Company, contractor;
for the Arkansas.
Mr. Bcott and Mr. Hanscnm were in'
! Washington to-day and are to appear :

I tendent Post of the Newport News Co

construction to-morrow morning, to ,

The authorities are fully determined ,
to make an example of the contractors ;

the extent of debarring them from bid

TIE VOTE FOR TREASURER.
Interesting Complication in Santa
Clara County.
SAX JOSE. Nov. 21.â Jus. who will be
given a Certificate of election for the
(â filer- of County Treasurer is puzzling the
people of this city and county. The can
vass of election returns by the Board of â 
Supervisors gave E. W. Conant, Good
Government League and Democratic
nominee, a majority of one over Joseph
Lotz. gang Republican.
Just before the official vote was an
nounred to-day Lotz appeared before the
board and asked that the vote for Treas
urer be recanvassed. This was readily
agreed to, all the Supervisors voting ayÂ«
except Roll. Lotz claimed that in Rerry
es9a an extra vote had been counted for
Conant. He said the tally Bheet showed
in one place a block of four yotos Instead
of five. In order to decide this the tally
I sheet in the hands of the inspector at
i Berryessa was sent for. When Highland
precinct was reached it was found that
Lot* had one more vote than was count- j
â ed This was given him and made his
j vote a tie with Conant. The Highland ;
tally sheet kept by the Inspector has also
been called for.
Ml kinds of rumors are current on the
streets to-night. One iÂ« that the Supervi
sors are attempting to count Lotz in,
and another that they will make the vote
a tie and have another election for
Treasurer, as the gang: is afraid that a
contest for the office may disclose fraud.
The Supervisors are being openly criti
cized for their action in thÂ»> matter.
The vote for County Treasurer has
changed frequently since election. The re
turns on their face showed that Conant
I was elected by sixteen votes, and Lotz
j conceded his d' feat. The official can
: vasa changed ten votes In Rucker pre-
I cinct to Lotz, and in another five were
; taken from Conant. This left Conant one
i ahead of Lotz. The recanvaaa to-day has
made them a tie, and Lotz' a friends are
relying on Berryessa precinct to put him
one ahead.
It Is hard to understand how the extra
vote in Highland escaped attention in the
flfst official canvass. That place gave
Lotz 15 and Conant 5. To-day Lotz nad
one more. After It was canvassed the
tally sheet was handed around the room,
and fifteen or twenty persons saw it. The
Berryessa tally sheet sent for gives Co
nant 93, Lotz 96. This Is the same as the
sheet In the clerk's office. UnlOÃfl some
excuse arises in the count of other pre
cincta to give Lotz another vote it. will
â  remain a tie, and another election will
I follow.

FOBT BAKER DESERTION.
; Private Samuel A. Breeding Takes
French Leave.
SAUSALITO, Nov. 21.â Fort Baker Is in
an uproar over the desertion of another
I private, and sco.utlng parties have been
j scouring the hills of Maxln County In a
fruitless search for the missing soldier.
Rather than, endure the aljeged 111-treat
ment to which he claimed to be subjected,
Samual A. Breeding, one of the most pop
ular boys in the camp, deserted his post
last nigljt, under sensational circum
stances, and not a clew has been discov
ered regarding his whereabouts, notwith
standing the fact that the ferries at Tib
uron and this city have been closely
guarded and that squads of bluecoats
searched the hills all last night and to
day in an endeavor to apprehend him.
He was an important witness in the re
cent investigation held by Lieutenant Ben
nett and feared that he would be made to
suffer for it. Accordingly he prepared
papers asking for his discharge on the
ground of physical disability, which were
signed by Dr. Williams, the post surgeon.
Yesterday Breeding asserted to a friend
that, owing to the agency of Captain
Choynski, he had learned that no dis
charge would be granted. He added that
he would desert rather than further en
dure the rigors of military life at Fort
Baker.
EXCEEDINGLY COSTLY FISH.
Oakland Dealers Pay Dearly for Vio- '
lating the Game Law.
Two Oakland flsh dealers, George Smith
of 914 Washington street, and John Ruck
er of Washington and Twelfth streets,
were yesterday made to feel the penalty
; of violating the- game laws of the State.
Last Wednesday they were arrested by
Deputy Fish Commissioner John Davis for
selling bass weighing less than three
pounds. . Davis purchased two small fish
for 25 cents from each place, which he
held, as evidence of the violation. The
men were released on $10 ball, and when
the cases were called on last Friday they
forfeited their bail, evidently supposing
that this was the last of the matter.
In this they made a serious miscalcula
tion, for yesterday Judge Moore had them
brought into court on bench warrants. He ;
heard the evidence and examined the fish. |
Without much ado the JUdge imposed a
fine of $30 on each offender, and made i
some pertinent comment upon folks who
encourage people to violate the laws of :
the State by buying and disposing of the
product of such offense. The fine of $30 I
added to the forfeited bail of $10 brought i
the price of the fish up to about $80 for 'â â 
the two, to say nothing of the lawyers'
â  fees. . â  ... . :,-â â .-

ALL THEIR PALACES PLACED AT

They Gave Aguinaldo $10,000 "With
the Understanding That He
Should Fight Solely for
Annexation.
Don Maximo and Don Angel D. Cortes, j
brothers, and Filipinos of much wealth
and distinction, arrived here from the
Philippines yesterday and registered at i
the Palace.
They bear the following Interesting !
letter from Consul General Wildman of
Hongkong;
"Oct. 22, 1898.
"To Whom It May Concern: This is to i
certify that Don Maximo Cortes is at j
present the he-ad of the wealthy and dis- ;
tinguished Cortes family of Manila. He !
is also the representative of the wealthy ]
and educated citizens of Manila who, i
from the commencement of the late war, j
have advocated the annexation of the i
islands to the United States. On May 6, |
1898, Don Maximo on behalf of his family
sent a cablegram through the consulate j
to President McKinley, submitting his
allegiance and praying for citizenship.
Shortly afterward, in my presence, he i
gave General Aguinaiuo $10,000, on the j
understanding that Aguinaldo was to j
ftghi Bolely fur annexation. With the
occupation ot Manila by Admiral Dewey i
and General Merritt. he placed all his I
palaces and houses at the disposal of our
forces, and they are now being occupied j
by them, rent frei-. General Merritt ac
knowledged the Government service ren- I
dered to our forces, both in my pr< sence ;
and to his successor, General Otis. In j
many other ways, such as giving in- I
formation, the Cortes family has ren- j
â¢ i ired material service to our people."
The Utter in closing bespeaks for the
Cortea brothers thÂ»> kindly courtesy of all
Americans, etc. The distinguished Fill- '
pitiQS, aimed with this letter, are here to [
shew tln-ir .sympathy with our republican I
institutions and \o implore President Me- j
Klnk-y to annex the islands. In an Inter
view yesterday they stated that a very |
larpe part of their property had been con- ;
fiscated by the Spaniards, and much of it j
has never been recovered. Their entire i

STOCKHOLDERS
ARE BECOMING
RATHER UNEASY
Hale&Norcross Funds
Vanishing.
GROOM'S FAT UNEARNED FEE
RECEIVER ALLOWED 95000 ON
ACCOUNT BY THE COURT.
Investors Fearful That the $300,000
Judgment Will Melt Away
and Leave Nothing
for Them.
When, at the end of seven years' litlga
| tlon, with all Its dips, spurs and angles,
j over $300,000 was paid by defendants Into
1 court the fore part of this month to sat
â¢ Isfy the Hale & Norcross judgment, the
i stockholders indulged in the high hope
that sumethlng was at last coming to
them. As between $6 and $7 a share has
been levied and collected on the stock by
way of assessments since the suit was be
gun it has not been a very, profitable turn
for those who got in early.
The receiver, J. J. Groom, having failed
to give his bond for $50,000, Banker Hell
| man kindly came to his relief upon condl
i tlon thut the money should be deposited
j in the Union Trust Company. A distribu
tion of the money then seemed to be in
i order. The judgment provided for a fee
of 25 per cent of the amount to Attorney
Baggett, which was promptly paid over,
as the stockholders cheerfully recognized
his right to this allowance for long, faith
ful and valuable services. This left some
1225,000 in the hands of the receiver.
The Gray son board (Grayson being
claimed to be another name for Hayward)
then annlied to the court to have this
money turned over to the company. It
was talked on the street that a dividend
of $1 to the stockholders was all that was
! to be expected. To this the Fox and Bag
gett board objected, also a large majority
of the stockholders, who were very sus
picious of the Grayeon board.
A meeting of the stockholders waa held
! on Tuesday, November 15, at which more
than two-thirds of the whole stock was
represented. A resolution was passed de
manding a dividend of $1 50 a share, also
recognising the Fox board and expressing
confidence in It. As $1 50 dividend was
! only about 50 per cent of the judgment.
i the demand of the stockholders for that
! amount can hardly be considered extor
i tlonate.
About the time of this meeting Judge
Hebbard, without notice to anybody, made
an order allowing Receiver Groom JSOOO
, and his attorneys, Lindley & Etckhoff,
1 the same amount, on account to that
j date. As the services of the receiver up
I to that time only consisted In paying Mr.
Baggett his fee, some curiosity has been
: excited on the nart of the stockholders to
know what may be the meaning of the
words "on account."
It has been suggested by some of the
: stockholders that unless an understanding
. is soon reached by the contending boards
; and themselves they may be painfully re
i minded of the fable about the cat and
I the cheese.

Stupefied with opium and the deadly i

Wong Gow were unable to escape from
tbe burning lodging-house at 22 and ill
Waverly place last nigrttt and were
i burned to death as they lay in their :
1 bunks in the cramped-up loft they called |
I their home.
I Detective fid Gibson and Officer McMa
' hon discovered smoke issuing from the:

diately turned in an alarm* from box 294.
They broke in the doors leading to the '
lodging-rooms on the upper floors and f
gave, warning .to the Inmates, a large,
number of whom hurried into the street.
The firemen had worked in the burning
building for nearly an hour and had the
flames well under control before the ;
bodies were discovered.
Quong Sin Lung, a merchant on Du
pont street, and the father of Ah Qui, ,
! the burned boy, was away from home j
when the fire started, and when he re- j
turned told the police that he feared his .
son was still in the building. His story j
was at first doubted, but he was so per- ,
sistent in his claim and so evidently
moved by his fear of the- son's peril that
an investigation was made and the two
bodies found. Ah Qui was near a. win
dow in the rear of the house and from j
the position of the body it is believed
he had attempted to make his escape, i
The body of Wong Gow was lying in a >
bunk. Both bodies were burned to a f
Wong Gow came here recently from
I Silver City, Idaho, where he has been
; in business. He was on his way to China
I and was to have sailed on the Coptic,
: having secured passage on that vessel.
During the excitement attendant on the
! fire Ung Gor, a woodchopper, living in the
I basement of the scorched building, ere-
I ated a little diversion by slashing one of
! his countrymen with a jackknife, threat
ening the crowd and assaulting the police
who came to place him under arrest.
i According to the disconnected story tola
by witnesses of the affair, Ung Gor was
accused by a Chinaman of setting lire to
the building. He became excited, drew a
! knife and slashed his defamer. Ihe
wounded man then made a lunge at Lng
Gor. cutting him in the abdomen, ung
Gor's opponent was spirited away, and
just how seriously he is wounded is not
I known. .
The excitement of his encounter seemed
to craze Ung Gor, and brandishing -is
knife above his head he drove the crowd
in front of him until stopped by Special
Larry Bellinger. The infuriated China
man aimed a blow at the special, who
dodged it. Officers Knight and Galloway
rushed to the scene of the disturbance and
were attacked by Ung Gor. Officer
Knight's corpulent stomach attracted tne
Chinaman's eye, and toward it he lunged
his knife. How he came to miss his mark
Knight Is unable to explain, but not wish
ing to run the risk of a second attack on
that his weak point, the officer laid Ung
Gor low with a blow from his club. The
vicious Chinese was taken to the Harbor
Hospital, and after his wounds were
dressed was locked up at the California
street station on the charge of assault to
commit murder.
Captain Comstock thinks the fire started
I In the store of Wang Sim Lung, a dealer
in general merchandise, and gives as the
cause of the blaze the overturning or ex
plosion of a coal oil lamp. The captain
! would not estimate the damage, saying
I that it was considerable. To the building
owned by Solomon Gctz and that on the
stock of "Sim Lung the loss is total. Tha
entire damage will probably reach $10,000.
OBJECT TO COBBLESTONES.
Polk Street Merchants Want a Bi
.. â¢ â¢ tumen Pavement on Their
; V'~ '""*- â¢'-' J {'' Thoroughfare. â¢
Polk street merchants are clamoring for
bitumen pavement. Lv H. KV>hn, a lead
ing merchant on that thoroughfare, said
yesterday:.
"As one of the board of directors of the
Polk-street Progress Club I unhesitating
ly say We do not want cobblestones any
longer on our street. It is time Polk street
advanced from the era of cobblestone
pavements to a modern pavement of bitu
men. Our street, the merchants doing 1
business on it, and the property owners
were the first to place electric lights on
the streets; an example that had been fol
lowed by almost all the business, centers
of the city, until at last the Supervisors
made provision in the present appropria
tion for this system of illumination.
"I am in favor of bitumen from Sutter
to Lombard street any way, and if the
street, was re paved to Market it would bo
all the better" ...Â» '. %
Kohn's expression's are shared in by
every member of the new club, which has
been recently started on the foundation of
the old Improvement Club. Following on
the lines of this improvement, the club
will also petition the Supervisors to have.
Polk street graded to the bay. Another
grievance which will receive the atten
tion of the club is that' of lights. The
majority of the merchants complain that
tIK-ir bills for electric lights are twice as
much as is charged in other portions of
the city.

A RATTLING PRACTICE GAME
BETTER REPORTS COME FROM

Stanford Plays a Good Defensive and
California a Strong Offensive
Qame â Coaches Are Hope
ful and Reticent.
At least 2000 spectators lined the Univer
sity of California gridiron and packed the
stands yesterday afternoon for the last
hard practice game before the match on
Thanksgiving day. All varieties of en
tertainment were offered â a cremation of
the hoodoo, fast and snappy football, In
termezzos by the college band, which for
the first time in its checkered career
played music that reached the dignity of
the name, and an enthusiasm of youth
that has never been equaled within the
confines of Berkeley.
The ceremonies were ushered in by the
burning of the tackling bag. This 1b a
custom at Princeton and at the suggestion
of Cochrane was put into pra.etice for the
lirst time on the California campus. Pre
cisely at 4 o'clock the students coming
from their recitations gathered in sardine
compactness about the stuffed effigy of
the god of hoodoos, the progenitor of four
football defeats. A torch was lighted and
the flames applied to the coal-oiled bag.
On an altar of sand the last remnants of
many weeks of preliminary wurk was sac
riticed to the awful lust of a god who has
made it his special business to alight upon
Tin' California banners on Thanksgiving
day. Whether or not the sacrifice will ap
pease his wrath and keep him quiet and
iar distant on Thanksgiving day will be
(it-cided not many hours hence. The low
dirge and funereal chant of the expiating
collegians was apparently weird enough to
expel the insatiable deity for all time.
This was the introduction to a most
eventful day on the Berkeley campus. The
conclusion brought forth great enthusiasm
ami such scenes as made the college town
wild with excitement. Cochrane. with a
Bhout of satisfaction, called out, "Line up
for the last play." Hardly had the words
s mouth 'when 500 rooters left then

from the gridiron. Rushing down

There was a genuine cause for all this
exuberance. The big eleven had played
its last hard practice game and it was
a ganv that well deserved the show of en
thusiasm. For forty minutes Cochrane
put his cubs through a practice that was
it, snappy, full of eringer and as sat
isfying as anything ever seen on the
Berkeley gridiron. The team which will
line up against Stanford on Thursday

What was? most encouraging to the Cali

eleven played as a unit, the interference
being strong and well formed. The pass
ing was fiuiok and the backs were well
under way at the time the ball was put in
the hands of the runner.
The work on the offense was of strong
quality, but not so fine on the defense.
Cochrane's criticism is as follows:
"I was well satisfied with the work of
the team on the offense, but the defensive
is all but satisfactory. The second eleven
was allowed to advance the ball at times,
and this should never be the case. It is
all right to say the team played good ball,

MET DEATH WHILE
AIDING HIS MOTHER
Arthur Delatour, Aged 8 Years,
Killed by a Falling Box.
Arthur Delatour, an eight-year-old boy, was struck on the head and
killed last evening by a box of iron bed rails in the rear of the establish
ment of Alexander Mackay & Son. The boy had left his home but five min
utes before, and was hunting for firewood to help his mother at the time
of -the unfortunate accident.
Witnesses of the accident carried the unconscious boy to the office of Dr.
Hapersberger, who did everything possible, but the injured child lived only
a few minutes. The mother, who has been separated from the father of the
child for several years, became frantic at the news of her son's injury, and,
accompanied by the aged grandfather, hurried to the doctor's office, only
to learn that her child, the only thing she had to care for, had been taken
from her.
The few persons who saw the accident pay that the boy was walking
along the sidewalk beside the boxes of bed rails, each of which weighed
about 300 pounds, and that the one which struck him fell just as he came
opposite them. There were three boxes standing together almost on a bal
ance, and it is believed that some slight jar just as the boy passed caused
the front box to fall. The boy was thrown violently to the sidewalk and
sustained v fracture of tht skull.
The two most important witnesses are James Gladstone, living at 13S
Francisco, and J. R. Mitchell. 1819 Post. They are employed by the gas
company, and were working on Stevenson street but a few feet away from
the scene of the accident. Both are positive that the boy did not touch the
box, and think that the accident was due to the careless manner in which
the boxes were placed against the building.
The people connected with the furniture company, scenting a damage
suit, are inclined to think that the boy must have been playing around the
boxes. "We have been bothered a great deal." said one of the gentlemen,
"by boys playing round the rear of the store and asking us for wood from
the cases. I don tsee that we can be blamed for this accident. Every day
we receive goods from the freight companies, and this the men who de
liver it unload on our sidewalk. We remove it as quickly as possible, but
sometimes are obliged to let it remain for several hours. As for the acci
dent this evening, I am of the opinion that the box would not have fallen
of its own volition."
a few hours, during which a wholesome I
breakfast was disposed of, and with a
shout of enthusiasm lined up for the
morning practice. The greater part of
the time was given over to signal work,
but during the last ten minutes the hard
est kind of practice was played.
In the afternoon the team played again,
this time for regular practice. The of
fensive work lacked harmony and unity.
There was a slowing down of . the backs,
who did not get into the play fast enough
to suit the coaches. The defensive work
was much better and more satisfactory.
In the practice Oilman sprained his an
kle, but not seriously. No other injuries
recurred. Freeman is recovering slowly
from his dislocation of the shoulder. The
coaches are reticent about the certainty
of his playing in the game on Thursday.
He did not play to-day and will not be on
the field before the Intercollegiate game.
From present indications it Is. the inten
tion of the coaches to play him Thurs
day. The other doubtful position is full
back. Burmeister has not been playing
the position since his last injury to his
knee, Fisher lining up as full to-day, but
may not be in place Thanksgiving day.
If he should play right half the choice
will lay between Dole and Clinton, with
the chances in the former's favor.
The team will play a light practice game
to-morrow and leave for San Jose on
Wednesday, going to San Francisco on
Thursday morning.
Nine of the second eleven men returned
to Palo Alto to-night. Their work Is over
and they will not don their jackets until
Thursday. The team lined up in the
practice as follows: â  , *

L. H. VALENTINE
WITHDRAWS HIS
CANDIDACY
Throws His Strength
to H. E.Wright.
ALL OVER BUT THE SHOUTING
THE SPEAXERSHIP QUESTION
PRACTICALLY SETTLED.
Reasons Given by the Southern
Californian for His Retire
ment From the
Contest.
The question of who will be Speaker
of the next Assembly was practically
| settled yesterday, when L. H. Valen
! tine of Los Angeles withdrew from the
i contest in favor of Howard E. Wright
j of Berkeley.
Though Wright's strength has been
! patent to those Interested in his candi
| dacy the fact of Valentine's withdrawal
| was nevertheless somewhat of a sur
| prise to the friends of both gentlemen
I As a member of the last Assembly Mr.
I Valentine made an enviable record as
a legislator, and his re-election to the
seat by a handsome majority was fit
ting: evidence of the manner in which
his services at Sacramento were appre
ciated at home. When he announced,
soon after the election, his candidacy
for the Speakership members of the
Los Angeles delegation and others
pledged him their support. He was
considered as the one formidable com
petitor with which Wright would have
to contend, and it was not until to-day
that he decided to retire from the con
test and throw his strength to his op
ponent.
Mr. Valentine arrived In this city
yesterday from his home in Los Ange
les. When asked for his reasons for
withdrawing his candidacy for the
Speakership he said
"Many things have combined to in
duce me to surrender whatever claim
I may have to the honor of being
i Speaker of the Assembly. First of all
is my interest in the candidacy of K.
X. Bulla for United States Senator.
The Los Angeles delegation and many
other Southern California legislators
are pledged to Senator Buila, and
should my candidacy for the Speaker
ship provoke a contest between my
friends and the friends of any other
candidate for the position the result
might be prejudicial to Senator Bulla.
I do not mean to say that such would
be the result, but I am so much in
terested, with others of the Los Ange
les delegation, in securing his election
to the high position to which we believe
he is entitled that I hesitate to enter
into any contest, however friendly, that
by any possibility could work him an
injury.
â¢'Still another reason, and a very
strong one, for my withdrawal at this
time is that I have a lively apprecia
tion of the part, Alameda County has
taken in the campaign just closed.
Notwithstanding the fact that her can
didate for the gubernatorial nomina
tion was opposed by a citizen of Los
Angeles and that he withdrew In favor
of that gentleman, Alameda County
stood solid for Henry T. Gage on elec
tion day and rolled up a majority in his
favor that entitles her to the honor of
being the banner Republican County of
the State. Now that one of her favor
ite sons seeks the position of Speaker
of the lower house of the Legislature
it is no more than right that we of
Southern California stand together to
assist in securing for him this well
deserved honor.
"I also believe it important that the
business of the session should not be
delayed by any contest over the Speak
ership. The coming session of the Leg
islature will be one of the most import
ant in the history of the State, and it la
to the best interests of the whole peo
ple that legislation should not be im
peded or delayed by any contest for
personal honors. It is of course essen
tial that the Speaker of the Assembly
should be a man fitted in every way to
fulfill the very weighty duties attached
to the position. Having served through
one Session of the Legislature with Mr.
Wright I know that no better man
than he could be selected as the pre
siding officer of the Assembly. He has
the confidence and respect of all good
citizens, and I shall consider it an honor
and a privilege to cast my vote for him.
"These are some of the reasons that
have induced me to retire from the con
test, and in doing so I wish to return
thanks to the many friends in all parts
of the State who have expressed their
willingness to stand by me if I chose
to allow my name to be presented as
a candidate for the Speakership."
Now that Mr. Valentine has with
drawn from the field Mr. Wright's elec
tion is one of the few certainties of the
first week's session of the Legislature.

GREAT APPETITE
FOR CHAMPAGNE
FRANK RICARDO SWINDLED A
NUMBER OF FIRMS.
Ordered thÂ« Wine to Be Sent to Dif
ferent Clubs and Was Always
on Hand to Receive It,
Frand Ricardo Is a young man with an
insatiable appetite for a certain brand of
champagne, and It has sot him into se
rious trouble. He is now in "the tanks
at the City Prison and several charges of
petty larceny will be booked against him.
Last week complaints were received by
the police from grocers that orders had
been sent them for champagne for differ
ent clubs, but the wine was never ordered
by the clubs nor did it reach them. De
tective Harry Reynolds was detailed on
the else and he instructed the grocers
that when the, next order was received to ,
telephone the nearest police station for an
officer and the officer would follow the
boy delivering the wine and catch the |
On the' afternoon of November 17 Gold
berg Bowen & Co. received a message
from the Cosmos Club for a supply of
wine. They at once telephoned to the Cal
ifornia street station and Policemen Mul
len and Peshon responded. They went
with the delivery boy and found Ricardo
waiting at the club door to receive the
wine. They promptly placed him under

quarts of champagne were ordered for
the Press Club and each time Ricardo
was there to take possession. Supplies
were also sent to the Concordla Club, The
grocers who have suffered most are Gold
berg. Bo wen & Co.. Lebenbaum & Co.. and
Lilienthal & Co. When searched a biU

Ricardo wears a Mystic Shriner gold
button and a snake ring with two dia

have been stolen. They want the owners
to come forward.
A NEW MARKET OPENED.
Transformation Effected at the Cor
ner of Clay and Montgomery
Streets.
A remarkable transformation has been
accomplished on Moiftgomery street dur
ing the past week, and this narrow, busi
nesslike thoroughfare has suddenly be
come a resort for the thrifty housewife
who desires to have her table furnished
with all the delicacies of the season. The
large store at the corner of Clay and
Montgomery has been converted into a
splendid market, which will compare with
anything of the kind in the city.
A. Fodera, the well known game sales
man, has accomplished this improvement.
Finding the old Clay-street market too
cramped and unsanitary for his rapidly
increasing business, he decided to move
Into new and more suitable quarters. At
the same time he gave up his branch
store in the Vauxhall markets, conclud
ing that it was better to concentrate his
attention upon the present centrally sit
uated site. The market occupies the
whole corner of the block, but still, dur
ing the past week, it has proved none too
large to accommodate the crowds who
have come to view and purchase Mr. Fo
deras magnificent supply of game.
The task of fitting up the establish
ment has been accomplished in first class
style by J. T. Maby. The whole interior
has been stripped and redecorated. The
plate glass windows have been removed,
and in their place open wire work shut
ters substituted. Thus day and night
there is a constant current of air through
the market, and the perishable goods dis
played are kept in the most perfect condi
tion. The game and poultry stall, which
occupies the entire center of the floor,
covers a space of 20x60 feet. The counter
Is of horseshoe shape and covered with
spotless marble slabs. At the back 13
the office and a large ice room, capable of
holding a thousand birds. Everything is
spick and span, bright and clean and
new; the disagreeable odors common to
many markets are entirely absent. Noth
ing that can attract the purchaser has
been neglected. â¢

Sharkey fight will be displayed by

these requests remain unheeded, more
stringent measures will be taken by the

CAST HER DEAD
BABY INTO A
GARBAGE CART
Awful Discovery at
the Crematory.
AN UNKNOWN MOTHER'S DEED
SOUGHT TO KID HERSELF OF THE
BODY OF HER CHILD.
A Richly Garbed Infant Found in a
Pile of Refuse Just as It Was
About to Be Inciner
ated.
While attending to his duties at the
garbage crematory at the foot of Eighth
street last evening William Cronln, a la
borer who is employed at the works,
made a horrible discovery. In one of
the hoppers into which the refuse is
poured before being burned. Cronin found
the body of a one day old infant. It was
richly clothed in elaborately embroidered
flannels, and on the sleeves of the hand
some dress were pink ribbons.
Cronin lost no time in notifying the Su
perintendent of the works, who after a
cursory investigation reported the matter
to the police. Detective Tom Ryan was
hastily dispatched to the scene, and after
having the body of the infant removed
to the morgue he proceeded to make an
Investigation. The long clothing was
carefully folded over the babe's feet and
the tiny body wrapped in a handsome
quilted blanket . which was carefully
pinned up with safety pins.
From Cronin he learned that at least a
dozen scavengers had visited the works a
short time before the body of the infant
was discovered. After dumping their
loads in the several hoppers they drove
away from the works.
Cronin did not have the least suspicion
that anything was wrong until he found
the dead infant on the top of a pih? ot
garbage. He was about to lower the re
fuse matter in the furnace when he made
the startling discovery.
As the infant's clothing, was not soiled
by contact with the pefuse the supposi
tion is that the driver of the cart which
carried the remains to the crematory se
creted the body under his seat, and after
reaching the works threw it into the hop
per in the hope that all evidence of the
crime would be destroyed after it had
reached the furnace.
The police are working on this theory,
and they are inclined to beleve that the
scavenger was paid well to get rid of the
dead infant.
An examination of the body did not re
veal any marks of violence. Coroner
Hawkins is Inclined to believe that the
Infant died a few hours after it was born
and the mother, anxious to hide her sin,
employed the scavenger to do away with
It. To-day a strong effort will be made
to find the scavenger who conveyed the
body to the crematory.
The police hope that by arresting him
he will reveal the name of the woman
who employed him to get rid of the body.
STANDING IN LINK.
i A Mercantile Attraction That Be-
I minded One of a Patti Season.
The weather clerk Wasn't been very
good to merchants, especially to those
with large stocks of winter goods on
hand, and the big clothing firm of Ra
phael's, in their advertisement Sunday,
took occasion to find particular fault
j with him, and began by forcing issues
and naming such ridiculously low
prices on overcoats they fairly took
one's breath away, and long before the
hour of opening there were crowds
standing in iine, which brought back
happy reminiscences of the days when
! people stood in line waiting for an op
i portunity to gp?t seats for the opera
| season of the divine diva Pattl.
This house of Raphael's has a happy
faculty of drawing large crowds, and
at most any time In front of it pedes
trianlsm iB indulged in with difficulty.
No doubt there are a great many men
to-day that got rid of that chilly feel
i ing by getting one of Raphael's good
overcoats at forcing-out prices. Of
course nobody despises the saving of
money, and this firm enjoys an en
viable reputation for high-class goods
at popular prices the coast over.
RUMOR SAYS
BRIBERS ARE
HARD AT WORK
Sensationalists Enjoy
the Nevills Case.
ARE LOOKING FOR AN EXPOSE
FOUR ELDERLY MEN UNDER
WATCHFUL EYES.
Their Unusual Interest in the Pro
ceedings, and Nothing More,
Has Directed Suspicion
Toward Them.
Matters progressed quietly yesterday in
I the trial of Elsie Williams, Grace Loose
| and Myron Azhderian, charged with ex
' tortlon. Vague rumors were current that
; gold was being freely circulated, either
j by the defense or prosecution, it mattered
: not which to the sensationalists, and an
j expose was likely to occur at any mo
; ment.
Four old men, all respectable in ap
'â  pearance, and bearing no outward or vls
i ible signs of dishonesty, were under the
j eye of the officers of the court all day.
These men (who they are no one appar
| ently knows) have drawn the shafts of
! suspicion toward them by reason of the
fact that they are Interested in the trial.
j That is all. Since the courtroom opened
i on the first morning of the proceedings
! these men have sat and, with hands to
ears., have digested every word of argu
: ment, testimony and ruling. This is why
j suspicion is directed toward them. They
| watch every movement of Judge, counsel
; and prisoners, keep their spectacled eyes
I on the jury when it leaves the room,
and, in fact, take unusual interest in all
i the official movements. This is the rea
son suspicion is directed against them,
and it Is the only reason.
Mrs. Elsie Williams was again subject
ed to a rigid cross-examination yesterday.
About the only fact that developed was
j that Mrs. Williams did not live with Nev
' ills for gain alone. She loved NevUls, she
i said, for many months, but when he be
1 gan to "abuse her, deceive her and lie
i to her, her love vanished and she hated
! him." Mrs. Williams adhered to her
! story given on direct examination in all
j material points. She" was a good witness
In her own behalf.
When Mrs. Williams left the stand her
I sister, Grace Loose, was railed. Mrs.
Loose had just begun to tell her story
when the hour for adjournment arrived
I and the case was continued until this
j morning.

THE MINERS' ASSOCIATION.
BY the vigor with which the contest has been
waged for the presidency of the California
Miners' Association evidence is given that the
convention i? to be something more than a per
functory meeting and that the importance of the
work of the association i? recognized by its members.
This evidence is gratifying. The association is one
of those industrial organizations from which the State
has a right to expect match. Despite the vast amount
of treasures that have been taken from her mines,
California is still a land whose mineral resources are
comparatively undeveloped. To hasten that develop
ment there is needed the co-operation of all who are
engaged in mining, and it is through the State Asso
ciation the co-operation can be best effected.
There are certainly strong reasons why the proceed- j
ing- of the convention should be marked by a spirit
of earnestness and 7eal. The time is propitious for a
gener.il revrval of mining in all parts of the State. I
The drought of the past year seriously interfered with
placer mining, and even quartz mining in some places
suffered from a lack of water. With the coming of |
the rainy season prospects brighten for both classes j
o ; miners, and accordingly mining enterprises are !
more favorably regarded by investors.
Moreover, in addition to the work which the asso
ciation has on hand in the direction of obtaining legis- j
ktion favorable to the mining industry from the
Government and the enactment of a satisfactory min
eral lands bill, there will be that required to prepare j
for a suitable exhibition of our mining industries and
resources at the Paris Exposition. That work cannot j
be longer delayed without entailing loss, for it will
not be possible to arrange a really comprehensive
exhibit if the task is put off to the last moment and
then undertaken in a flurry and carried on in haste.
It is to be hoped something may be accomplished
at the convention which will bring into the association
a fuller representation of the mining interests of the
south. That section of the State is rich in minerals,
and is even less developed than other sections. The
men who are interested in southern mines have there
fore strong reasons for co-operating with the State
Association in working for all measures that tend to
the benefit of the industry.
At this time the world is searching for gold more
vigorously than ever. Improved methods of treating
ores render it possible to work with profit mines that
a few years ago would have been worthless. Cali
fornia ought to reap a large profit from the new
impulse toward gold mining and the new processes of
working. She will do so if the value of her mines
is fully made known to the world and the Government
enacts legislation favorable to the industry. It is for
the Miners' Association to see to it that these things
are done.
Not long ago there was printed an article concern
ing the microbes roosting upon every coin, only
awaiting the chance to introduce themselves into the
human system. It was a well-written article, logical,
convincing. Vet such is the obstinacy of human j
nature that people have kept right on collecting
money, utterly regardless of the necessarily fatal ef
fect so clearly demonstrated. So long as they fail to
realize that the microbes are there perhaps they will !
escape harm. Coins have been in use for several
years now. and nobody has been known to die of
them.
Actions are governed by every variety of human
impulse. Here is a soldier, absenting himself from
camp so as to get married, knowing that he will be
sent to prison for it, and can only see the bride ]
through the bars. Others have enlisted because of i
having been married, and still others sailed with light
hearts to Manila, happy that the transport swung j
away from the dock before the arrival there of a
yearning lady with a Sheriff, a warrant and a license.
A gentleman who had an iron bar fall three stories
and alight upon his head declares that the experience
benefited his health. However, those who wish to
profit by a similar operation are counseled to begin
by letting the bar fall only two stories.
Spain is said to be ready for war. which is a sur
prising circumstance, as Spain did not seem to be par
ticularly ready when the emergency arose not so very
long ago.
A man who bet on the wrong horse has gone crazy.
If every man to have the same experience were to do
likewise this would be a community of lunatics.
There is a suspicion that some of the jurymen who
have been doing duty of late ought to be in court
again, but in another capacity.
Perhaps there is some prejudice against Becker and
Creegan, enough at least to knock out the presump
tion of innocence.
BLfHNE'S VIEWS OF CONQUEST.
ONE hears frequent references to Blame as au
thority for the proposition to hold tropical
possessions by right of conquest. The spirit
of what has come to be known as "Blame's Ameri
canism" is often referred to in order to bind the
countrymen oi that statesman to a policy which it is
attempted to force upon the administration by what
is made to appear as the preference of public opinion.
As a matter of fact, this proposed policy is in antag
j onism to the international policy for which Blame
i labored. His views first took shape in the call he
j issued as Secretary of State November 29, 1881, for
I a pan-American Peace Congress. In that call he
I said: "The sole aim of this peace congress shall be
j to seek a way of permanently averting the horrors of
! cruel and bloody combat between countries, oftenest
I of one blood and speech, or the even worse calamity
! of internal commotion and civil strife; that it shall
â¢ regard the far-reaching consequences of such strug
i gles â exhausted finances, oppressive debt, onerous
taxation, ruined cities, paralyzed industries, devastated
fields, ruthless conscription, the slaughter of men,
the grief of widow and orphan, with a legacy of em
bittered resentments that long survive those who
provoked them and heavily afflict the innocent gen
i erations that may come after." When Blame left the
, Arthur Cabinet, his successor, Frelinghuysen, with
! drew the invitation to this peace congress, whereupon
j Blame, then a private citizen, addressed a letter to
President Arthur, protesting against the withdrawal,
and in his statement of the foreign policy of the Gar
field administration, which was his policy, said:
"Peace is essential to commerce, is the very life of
honest trade, is the solid basis of international pros
perity."
These pacific views of Blame were projected into
the Pan-American Congress which was promoted by
him as Secretary of State in President Harrison's
I Cabinet. Therein they took the formal shape of a
proposition on the part of the United States and all
of the countries represented to relinquish and aban
don the right of conquest.
It will be seen at once that this was Blame's real
Americanism. Devoted to the purpose and traditions
! of this Government and an earnest believer in our
very foundation statement that "governments derive
their just rights from the consent of the governed,"
i he could have nothing but aversion for replacing that
'â  by asserting the right of conquest as superior to the
1 consent of the governed.
It is plain that he believed that this could not be
come a conquesting nation without abandoning the
very principle of its' existence. The fact that a con
quered people might be incapable of expressing their
assent or dissent, that they might be so unlearned in
our methods and processes of government and so
dazed by the assertion of our authority among them
as to stand silent does not alter the situation at all.
In Elaine's view, the effect to be avoided was that
upon ourselves rather than upon a weak, ignorant
and alien people over whom we might assert the
right of conquest.
Nor is it a question of holding such a people by
force while we educate them up to the plane of con
sent. The condition in which consent may be indi
cated must precede our exercise of any permanent
authority over them at all.
France took the Palatinate by conquest and the
people by infusiop and contact after many genera
tions came to be French in feeling, and when they
were reconquested by Germany resented that as their
ancestors had resented the conquest by France. But
this Government cannot go into that kind of business.
There is no provision under our system for reducing
a people by conquest and incorporating them into
our system by force of arms.
In view of his record on that subject, if Blame
were alive he would be found opposing true Ameri
canism to the medieval doctrine of right of conquest.
His reason for putting forward in the Pan-American
Congress the denial and abjuration of the right of
conquest was not far to seek.
The Central and South American nations had upon
them the European spirit of conquest. Chile had
despoiled Peru of her provinces and people. The
j Central American nations were prone to convert
boundary disputes into wars of conquest. The right
of conquest has been in all ages the cause of war and
the afflicting train of miseries which follows it.
| Blame desired to put away this greedy and evil spirit
and to banish it from the Western Hemisphere for
ever.
It will not do to say that he would have reserved to
the United States the power to enter upon the con
quest of territory' belonging to any European power,
for that would have been not only a violation of the
principle he promoted but such a breach of faith as
! to forever lose to us the confidence of the Americas
i and of all nations.
WHEN PROMOTERS DISAGREE.
OF the Nicaragua canal enterprise it may be said
the President desires it, Congress favors it,
the people wish it, the nation needs it; and
yet it is doubtful if it will be even so much as under
taken for many a year to come. Certainly the out
look at present promises nothing more than discus
sion and debate ending as they began, with disagree
ment on the part of the debaters.
The difficulty in the way of the accomplishment of
the enterprise is that there are too many promoters,
and they have too many plans for promotion. There
is a strong faction which believes it would be better
tc buy out the Panama Company and complete that
canal rather than undertake one across Nicaragua
on any conditions. Among those who agree on the
Nicaragua route there are some who would have the
Government construct as well as control the canal,
and others who prefer that the Government should
back the Maritime Canal Company and have that cor
poration perform the work. Finally, among those
who agree that the Government should undertake the
enterprise there are some who would vote against it
unless it can be shown that the construction will not
entail a cost much in excess of $100,000,000.
All these differences of opinion might be settled
were it not for the fact that there is a strong and
powerful body of men who do not wish them settled.
Every shifting of the channels of trade, no matter
how much it benefits the community generally, in
jures somebody. There are interests that will suffer
by the opening of a shorter water route between our
Atlantic and our Pacific coast.
The men who control these interests are neither
blind nor weak. They perceive the situation clearly,
and they have organized for a tight. If they can keep
the friends of the measure divided they will do it.
They have sense enough to know that the best way
to defeat an enterprise favored by the people is to
suggest two or three different ways of doing it and
then stand aside while the argument goes on and
the factions get heated.
From the extent to which the Panama canal scheme
has been exploited in the United States ever since the
war made clear to our people the immense importance
o? a short route between the two oceans it is evident
that the policy of the opponents of the canal is to be

THE PUBLIC POUND.
OXE of the first acts of the Republican Board of
Supervisors, which will take office on January
I, should be to dismiss the Poundkeeper ap
pointed by the present board and restore the control
of the Pound to the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals. Once before the institution
under Democratic rule became a disgrace to the city,
and a Republican Board of Supervisors gave it to the
Society. The present condition of affairs is due to the
desire of Democratic Supervisors to make places for
politicians.
Under the jurisdiction of the Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Animals the Pound for several
years was conducted with humane regard for the
rights of dogs, goats, horses, cows and their owners.
Not a single scandal put in an appearance throughout
its regime. The moment, however, the Pound was
taken away from it and placed in the hands of a poli
tician it became a source of complaint and annoyance
all around. During the past year Pound outrages,
Police Court prosecutions and street affrays resulting
from the attempts of hoodlum deputies to capture
cstray dogs have been an almost every-day occur
rence.
Under the present law it will ever be difficult to take
the Pound out of politics, since the Supervisors may
at any time reverse any policy that may have been
adopted. The resolutions of one board are not bind
ing upon another, and, as we have already seen, Re
publican boards take the Pound away from the poli
ticians and Democratic boards give it back to them.
The latter usually resist to some extent, but as the
genius of Democracy in San Francisco is office-hold
ing and creating offices for the members of the "or
ganization." they finally succumb to the blandish
ments of the "push."
What should be done with the Pound is to abolish
the system of fees under which it is conducted. The
i new Board of Supervisors ought to pass an ordin-
a nce establishing the institution on a firm and en
1 during basis. This would have to go before the
Mayor, and a change of system could take place only
by the enactment of a repealing ordinance and the
; consent of the Mayor. Ordinarily, the Pound is sub
, verted by a combination of machine politicians who
possess few or no political resources, and if a barrier
of this kind were established the difficulty of over
: turning it would probably be for them insurmount
\ able.
At all events, the Pound should be taken out of
politics by the new Supervisors. There is not much
spirit in the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals; had there been, the present Supervisors
would have hesitated before they inaugurated the pre
vailing Pound regime. But action by that organiza
tion need not be awaited. The new Supervisors owe
something to the women and children of the city, who
are always the victims of hoodlum Poundkeepers.
JESSIE A. SCHLEY asserts with a pleasing
confidence that she brought Spain to terms.
She tells how she presented the case over there
with a diplomacy more acute than a, mere statesman
could command, and how, before her unanswerable
argument, the monarchy trembled with apprehen
, sion and then took a tumble to itself. Had the
prowess of this young woman been understood in
! advance, her persuasive manner appreciated and the
i magnetism of her presence a matter of record, there
would have been none of the turmoil of war, and the
captains, instead of shouting, could have stayed at
home and talked in moderate tones through their
fatigue hats. Now that Miss Schley has told her
story opinions will have to be revised, and the
erroneous belief that the affair was brought to a
speedy close by Richard Harding Davis cast aside.
< This will be a blow to Richard, but in deference to
the lady he must take it.
We grab this opportunity to place upon certain
stories concerning Miss Schley the brand of disap
proval. It has been said that in going to Spain she
! was guilty of an impertinence, that she constituted
a pitiful display of assumption, and that in propelling
her across the border and in the direction of home
1 Spain performed the most fitting act of its entire
campaign. We felt sorry for. the woman, ashamed
of her and wondered why her family did not lock her
in the cellar and let her do her conversing into a
â  phonograph â later, of course, destroying the phono-
graph.
Such apology as is due Miss Schley is hereby ten
dered. She is no silly guy, chattering with the intel
ligence of a parrot. No, sir. She is great. She says
so herself and she ought to know. Now let her go
and hypnotize Aguinaldo.
There is something sweet in the sympathy France
is offering to Spain over what it is pleased to term
"American rapacity." France regrets that Spain is j
, likely to lose the possessions held and abused by it |
| for so many years, but never seems to think that
Spain has been in any measure to blame. As a matter
of fact, there is some question as to the wisdom of |
taking the Philippines, but it does not spring from j
, the circumstance that anybody in this country is
sorry for Spain. That country not only invited the
I fate which has come upon it but kept repeating the
invitation until there was no decent possibility of
longer refusal to accept. Now its kicking is more
spectacular than useful.
An Ohio court has accorded damages to a brake
man who had sued a company for having blacklisted
him. To "blacklist" a man is to so discredit him that
he cannot obtain employment. That no corporation
nor individual has a right to do this is plain enough,
! and as the matter reached the stage of being passed j
â¢ upon judicially, no other decision could have been j
expected.
Few of the lowa soldiers before they sailed for
Manila had ever seen a larger body of water than ;
could be encompassed by a cowtrack on a rainy day.
No wonder some of them got sick.
Senator Allen of Nebraska has fallen out with
I Bryan; but as the voters of the country seem to have
i clone the same thing the Senator does not feel lone
some.
Perhaps there will be a grain of satisfaction for
Shafter in the fact that the dirty papers of England |
are throwing mud at Kitchener.

APPORTIONING THE GLORY.
GRANT SELECTED BY A SYNDICATE.
We are informed by the Examiner that there is a "tremendous row In
the Republican household over the Senatorial candidacy of Ulysses S. Grant
Jr." If there is any row in California over the candidacy of Mr. Ulysses S.
Grant Jr., the row is not in the Republican party. Mr. Grant must be
having the r >w all by himself.
There is in this country no law of primogeniture an t no law of entail.
A man may transmit to his son his goods and gear, his lands, titles and
hereditaments: he may transmit to him a sound mind in a sound body; he
may transmit to him his name; but he cannot transmit to him his fame.
Even in England, where landed estates may be entailed, fame cannot be.
Titles and foily canâ many a belted earl is the tenth transmitter of a foolish
face. But fame cannot be. In Great Britain some of the bearers of great
and noble names are to-day the most ignoble. .In this country even landed
estates cannot be entailed, and fame least of all. Who wants fame must
win it for himself. After we have held our new possessionsâ Porto Rico,
Cuba and the Philippinesâ as military colonies for some generations, our
â¢governors-general may ha*e so far changed our republican form of govern
ment as to transmit their military and nobiliary titles to their sons. But
until that time comet the sons of generals in thes,- United States are as
the sons of other men.
Mr. Ulysses S. Grant Jr. came to Californiaâ with a carpet-bagâ and
settled in San Diego because k has a genial climate. He is welcome. We
hope that he will remain in this favored State, where every prospect pleases
and only drought is vile. But he must not expect that we shall at once
make him a Senator because his father was a President. We in California
are accustomed to give the highest gifts in our commonwealth to those who
have borne the heat and burden of the day, and not to those who come into
the vineyard at the eleventh hour â with a carpet-bag. We do not doubt
that Mr. Ulysses S. Grant Jr. may possess many qualities of mind and heart
which would fit him to adorn the United States Senate. But there are
many worthy gentlemen in California possessing equally admirable quali
ties who have been here longer than Mr. Ulysses S. Grant Jr., and who
did not come here the day before yesterdayâ with a carpet-bag. We beg to
assure this ton of a distinguished father that their claims will receive con
sideration before his.
We are informed that Senator Elkins of West Virginia and National
Committeerm.n Ilerens of St. Louis "represent a syndicate which has de
cided to make .[r. Grant Senator from California." This is really Very good
of them. The East aoes a great deal for California. Eastern r ndicates
and trusts regulate our railroad rates, fix the price of our petroleum and
settle the cost of our breakfast-table sugar. Doubtless there are other
things which syndicates arrange for us. But we have not yet quite reached
the plane where we will allow Eastern syndicates to select our Senators in
California.
Mr. Ulysses S. Grant Jr. is the son of a great general, but it does not
need the son of a seventh son or the son of a prophet *o tell him that he has
no more chance of becoming United States Senator from California than
he has of becoming Mikado of Japan. â The Argonaut.
A NEW FACTOR IN REPUBLICANISM.
Since the election, which rolled up a larger Republican majority than
ever before in this State, many theories have been advanced to account for
the result. The Republican majority in the next House is put at 13. This
State by taking out three Democrat-Populists and replacing them with
three Republicans makes a change of six, and so is responsible for nearly
one-half the party majority in the next House. To have done this is no
small achievement and carries with it no slight distinction. It is accounted
for by fusionists by saying that it was a Avar year, and the war helped the
Republicans, therefore the result is transitory. It is strange that such su
perficial ideas take root and survive. It is highly probable that the war
did the Republicans more harm than good. The elections came after the
fighting was over, and the enthusiasm had evaportated and the people had
reached the stage of criticism and complaint about the war, the hospital
service, the rations furnished the sick, the camp sites and other matters
that had no tendency to increase the popularity of the administration.
History shows that war is not such a good thing for the party in
power when it occurs. The Democracy sustained a disastrous defeat im
mediately after the Mexican War and the Republicans lost the elections of
1862 in the midst of the Civil War. As far as California is concerned, the
partisan gains from the war were decidedly Democratic. A Democratic
Governor had the appointment of volunteer officers, and a Democratic ad
jutant general had the control and disposition of the regiments.
It is evident, therefore, that there were other influences than the war to
account for the result here. In our judgment the new factor was The San
Francisco Call. It made a clean campaign from the start, and when its
course is studied it is seen that it forced the fighting and attacked cease
lessly to the last day of the fight. Not a syllable of defense appeared in its
columns. With a rare conception of political strategy it forced Judge Ma
guire's views on land confiscation to the front and made them issues in
spite of his daily declaration that they were not. By this persistent attack
The Call, leading the fight, actually drove out of the public mind all other
issues except those which it made, and upon them the tickets went to judg
ment and the Republicans won.
Heretofore the Examiner, with its matchless effrontery, has had pretty
much its own way in campaigns, and if met at all by the Republican press
of San Francisco the opposition has been timid. But The Call adroitly drew
the Examiner into a defense of itself right In the midst of the fight, and
The Call had such perfect proof of Its case, the charge of blackmail of the
railroad, that the time taken from the party campaign by the Examiner
in defending itself was time lost, for its defense was inadequate.
The Call In fine has set a new pace for its party in this State and has
become a most valuable factor in political and all other affairs. Hereafter
it must be reckoned with in all things that effect the State.â Contra Costa

A. P. French Tells of His Experience
in Attempting to Leave That
Benighted Free Silver
Country.
The American consular service unflef
the present administration in Guatemala
is affording protection to American citi
zens in that country in a highly satisfac
tory manner and this fact Is all the more
praiseworthy because of the lukewarm
interest taken in that regard by the con
sular officials during the last Democratic
I rule. There has been a marked improve
ment and the men appointed by President
McKinley are winning words of commend
ation from many Americans who require
their help. The service Includes Godfrey
W. Hunter of Kentucky. Consul General
M. C. Beaupre of Illinois and Consular
Agent G. Laurentz.
A. P. French, who was a captain or tnÂ©
Fifth Minnesota Infantry in the War of
Rebellion, arrived here from Guatemala
on the City of Sydney and related an In
teresting story of his experience.
"Had it not been for the efforts made in
my behalf by the consular service there,
said he, "I would have had my silver tak
en away from me and most likely been in
carcerated in one of the vile prisons in
San Jose de Guatemala. As it was I was
put to considerable trouble. I was located
! in Guatemala and desiring to leave there
â  I gathered some *30<> in Peruvian silver
I money and several hundred in American
dollars, which latter I had exchanged for
Mexican coin at the rate of three to one.
No one is allowed to leave Guatemala
! without an order from the Supreme Oov-
I ernment, as it is called, and Minister
Hunter told me he would get it for me.
! He then gave me a letter of introduction
| to the comandante at San Jose explain
! ing the circumstances. When I reached
i there I presented the letter to the com
i andante, who said he had received no
dispatch from the Supreme Government,
but would wire for instructions. Ho
1 thought that everything would be all
â  right and I left him.
"That afternoon at 2 o'clock I was
i placed under arrest and taken to the
i chief clerk of the comandante, who took
i my silver away from me, counted it,
i placed it in his safe, and walked away. I
I sent word to Consular Agent L.aurentz,
who immediately came up and after some
forcible expostulation with the comand
ante I was allowed to go to n>y steamer
and my money was returned to me. I at
tribute the action? of the Guatemala offi
cials to the fact that the war has engen
dered a spirit of animosity against Ameri
cans, and that they hate to ace any silver
leave the country. Had I given them a
fee I probably would not have been both
ered. But as long as the present Repub
lican consular officials are in power Amer
icans will be afforded the best kind of pro
tection."

Saunders brought over the old sprinter

Alex Shields and Cash Sloan got in
here on Wednesday from Lakeside track
with Topmast, Dare 11. Prince Blazes,
Ruskin and Frank Jaubert.
Joe Rose had but one book on yester
day. Joe was reported to be nearly
$10,000 loser on last week's operations, so
concluded to let Bill Jackson and his
crew take a rest.
Riley Grannan Is reported to be $10,000
ahead of the game of booking up to
date. The Kentuckian has discarded his
plunging tactics to a great extent.
The officials in the stand notified Enoch
Wishard yesterday that hereafter
Master J. Relff would be allowed to
accept but two mounts a day, and then
only on good acting horses. "So many
longshoremen are seen In the saddle these
days that the judges were fearful the
little fellow would meet with some acci
dent.
James Neil was the happiest man at the
auction gale last night. After he had
Morelia, a Moretlo filly, knocked down to

I offered $50 for his bargain. He refused

Otttnger, the ticket broker, was one of
the many who unloaded on Pat Mor
rissey.
j Starter Caldwell set Wainwright down
j for the meeting. The boy had tne mount
on Don't Tell, and conveniently got left
at the post.
Nick Hall, not an ounce heavier in
avoirdupois, got in from Chicago yester
day, and reports a season of 111 luck.
Nick says that Canace was so highly
touted that he was afraid to enter her
in selling races. This compelled him to
start her in events where she was out
classed slightly, with a result that on
seventeen occasions she finished second.
Sevens, his other fast filly, went wrong.
Jockey McNichol arrived with him.
1 rank Rutter had many admirers when
he first arrived here, but his saddle work
of late has taken on a yellowish hue that
is not always pleasant to the eye. The
race won by Ailyar yesterday was a
rough looking affair all through, bet
ting not excepted, and Rutter's ride on j
Anchored will not increase his percentage
at the end of the season.
The gentlemen's race for Thursday has
closed with six entries. Mr. Hobart will
ride Mistral 11, Mr. Skinner Stan Pow
ers, H. Forsland Una Colorado and Mr.
Dunphy- William 08.
Tommy Lottridge and Jimmy Coffey, j
both clever trainers, resorted to the
"dope" yesterday and played Valenci
enne. Tommy says figures run for the
mathematicians, after this.
When horses go to the post they are
supposed to take positions at the bar
rier according to the number assigned !
them on the programme, and starters
should see that they do this. Cyril drew I
the rail position, yet Rutter took him to 1
the dry going on the outside, the horse i
from the way he was ridden, having no '
fancy for the mud. These positions have i
much to do with influencing the betting
and if the rule was worth making it
should be enforced.

SELF-DEFENSE HIS PLEA.
Albert Blerwirth of the Globe Lodging House
Charged With the Murder of Arthur
Brown,
ALBERT BIERWIRTH. proprie
tor of the Globe House, 821
Howard street, was booked at
the City Prison yesterday by De
tective Ryan and Policeman Tulte
on a charge of murder in connec
tion with the death of Arthur F.
Brown of 2517 McAllister street from
a fractured skull. Blerwirth does not
deny striking Brown on the 'head
with a policeman's club, but claims
it was done in self-defense. He
said:
"Brown, Louis "Webber and May
Bennett were in the latter's room
making considerable noise. My. wife
went to the room and told Brown to
lf;ave. He refused, and she pent for
me. I tried to persuade him to
leave, but he used vile language to
ward mo, and T took him by the
collar and led him out. When we
got down the first flight of stairs he
refused to go farther, and made a
pass at mo with his fist. I went to
the office and got the club, and when
I returned he grabbed hold of me
and tried to drag me over the ban
ister. Thr-n I hit him on the head
with the club and he went away. I
never saw him before and had no in
tention of injuring him. All I want
ed was to get him out of the house.
as he was disturbing the other room
ers. I struck him to prevent myself
from being pulled over the banis
ters."
The officers took Louis Webber
and May Bennett to the Morgue
yesterday, and they identified
Brown's body as that of the man
who was hit by Blerwirth. The wo

ernment.
Ex-Queen IJlluokalan! of Hawaii, ac
companied by several personal friends, her
physician. Dr. English. Hon. Paul Neu
mann and Colonel George W. Macfarlane,
arrived here on the Coptic yesterday and
took apartments at the California, where
sjie denied herself to all visitors.
Colonel Macfarlane, however, consented
to act as her spokesmnn.
"Llliuokalani comes here," he Bald, "to
present her claims to the crown lands
which, she asserts, were illegally trans
ferred by the Provisional Government
to the United States Government In con
summating the annexation bargain. Her
previous visit to Washington some
months ago was in the Interest of her
people, who petitioned her In all parts of
the island to do everything In her power
to prevent annexation, not only to the
United States, but to any country.
"The natives were unanimously against
the extinction of their national indepen
dence and a majority of the foreigners :
held the same views. It is even said that
â  majority of the American residents
there were opposed to a loss of Hawaiian
Independence. Owing to war between Spain'
and the United States a desire suddenly j
arose In Congress to pass the Hawaiian |
annexation treaty. Annexation having â 
been an accomplished fact, the Queen re
turned to the islands and Informed her >
subjects of the passage of the treaty and
advised them to accept the situation.
"She is now on a mission purely In her j
own interest, and that is to lay claim
to all the revenues that are being col
lected on the crown lands and to assert
her title to said landsâ the revenues from
which, at present prices for sugar lands
would reach well up into the hundreds of
thousands of dollars."
Another and reliable authority on Ha
waiian matters estimates the present
value of the crown lands at $4,000,000.
yielding an annual revenue of $160,000. AM
bf the large sugar estates on the islands
are largely situated on these lands, which
are most of them leased for long terms.
The ex-Queen Is said to consider it be
neath her dignity to accept a pension, and
will merely ask her rights of the ad
ministration and Congress, to which
latter body she will probably submit her
case early in the approaching session.
Colonel Macfarlane has been appointed
financial agent in the settlement of the
crown lands claim, and eminent counsel
in San Francisco and the East will han
dle the case. *ion. Paul Neumann. At

It is said that nearly $500,000 in rents
have been collected from the crown lands
since the Provisional Government con
fiscated them. Lilioukalanl will leave for
Washington to-morrow and Colonel Mac
furlane will return to Honolulu on the
llliuokalani and party attended the
California Theater last night.

man denies that Brown used any
vulgar or offensive language to
Blerwirth or his wife. They were
talking loudly, when Mrs. Bier
wirth came and ordered Brown out.
All that he said was not to drag
him out, as he was a gentleman, and
would go out as a gentleman. While
in her room he spent about 50 cents
for beer. When Ryan and Tulte
came to the house on Saturday night
Mrs. Blerwirth came to her and told
her to get out of the house and say
nothing. Webber claims that he
was ton drunk to remember any of
the circumstances. He was a friend
of Brown, and took him to the house
to see May Bennett, who was also a
friend of his. What hpoame of
Brown's money is a mystery. Web
ber had only a dollar on him when
arrested and May Bennett says
Brown only spent 50 cents while in
her room.

THE BEST
WAR PLAY
EVER WRIT
"Secret Service" Is a
Huge Success.
FINE ACTING THROUGHOUT
NEW COMEDIANS AT "GAY
CONEY ISLAND."
Special Production at Morosco's.
Comedy at the Alcazar â Or
pheum Variety and
Others.
William Gillette's "Secret Service"
was played by the author and hi 3 com
pany at the Baldwin last night to a
crowded audience. The performance
flniÃhed at about 11:30, and the crowd
was still there, including yours faith
fully, who forgot all about such trifles
as newspapers that must go to press in
time to meet the suburban's early
breakfast. Some plays are easy to
leave at a decent hour, even when you
leave to praise them; but "Secret Serv
ice" is no-t one of that sort. It grips
you like a vice and you and your seat
are wedded until the last curtain is
down.
See "Secret Service" and you will
know what it is to be thrilled by a war
play; you will know how it feels to be
proud of a native playwriter; you will
be gladder than ever that you are an
American. The not-so-iate unpleas
antness between tho North and the
South has been exploited on the stage
time and time over without revealing a
really strong, sane play. Scenery, fire
cracker situations and drill sergeant's
stage direction have gone to make
what excitement and picture were in
the pieces, and their virtue consisted
entirely of machine made excitement
and gaudy pictures. The stagy" pomp
of war cuts but a slim figure in the ex
citement of "Secret Service." War is
on, you feel it and smell it in the tense
atmosphere; there is the tramp of sol
diers and the clatter of arms and the
wonderful "noises without" (without
which it seems no modern war drama
can exist). But these are but
the tokens of the time of
action; they do not dictate the drama,
but merely label it as of the American
war variety. The figures you have met
before, some in one play, some in an
other: the Southern heroine, the North
ern officer; the So-uthern ingenue and
her youngster lover who goes out to
fight and comes home with injuries;
and the Southern officer who stirs up
all the trouble for the hero. Life is
limited, and, as 1 say, you have mqfc
with other stage people of this descrip
tion. But you. have never seen them
shuffled and dealt as Mr. Gillette shuf
fles and deals them, and you have
never seen them made human.
It is true that -Secret Service" has
but one Northerner among its person
ages (unless you count the brother who
comes on only to be killed), and no
villain in the strict sense of the word;
but it is not here that its vital differ
ence lies. The scheme of character is
practically the same as in the other
war plays; even the man who is not a
real villain fills all the purposes of one,
and the comic relief and the comic love
making take up the usual percentage
of time. The difference is in the art
that has gone into the construc
tion of the piece and In the
humanness of the lines. There
are no false heroics, no extreme em
phasis, no situations that lean on the
long arm of coincidence; every line,
every bit of action, every climax is
bent" toward a single end. "Secret
Service" is not a drama of character.
It deals in action and hardly anything
else. It tells in quick, vivid strokes the
story of a spy who betrays his cause
rather than the girl who loves himâ a
story that you have known many times
in many other forms; it iH frankly ro
mantic in tone, idealizing what is not
necessarily ideal, and yet it is never ob
scene in its trust and optimism. It gives
you the event, which occupies about
the same amount of time in the play
ing as it does in the time-table on the
programme, and you furnish your own
reflections and philosophy. Action and
suggestion are the watchwords, and the
result is that Mr. Gillette has given the
world a war melodrama WhCB6 appeal
is mental as well as physical. To say
that "Secret Service" is the best of the
war plays means nothing. It is a vin
dication of them, and it is unquestion
ably the finest specimen of playwrlting
that has ever come to light in America.
The acting fits the play. It is quick,
sensitive ami in beautiful ensemble.
Mr. Gillette stands alone in the acting
that seemes not acting, and he does
the work of his life in the part of the
spy hero. Imagine that cool imperti
nence and poise and invention of his in
"Too Much Johnson" transposed into a
tragic key and you have an idea of his
Captain Thorne. Miss Sara Perry is
unobtrusively sympathetic as the
heroine. Miss Hope Ross twinkles
alertly as the ingenue, and â well, the
hour is too late to catalogue the many
achievements of the company. See
"Secret Service" and take heart in the
American drama. The ending of the
second act is in my opinion one of the
strongest in any tongue.
ASHTON STEVENS.
Alcazar. â 
The Alcazar stock company presented
Sydney Rosenfeld's new comedy, "Imag
ination," to a large audience last even
ing. Some of the situations were very lu
dicrous, and when the old man who has
been "having a good time" with his
nephews is exposed the fun Is fast and
amusing.
Wullace Shaw, in the part of Harry
Jelllman, "a dear old boy. was quite en
tertaining, while George Osbourne. Ernest
Hastings, Charles Bryant and Frank Den
ithorne were well suited to their parts.
The principal female characters were well
presented by Miss Howe, Miss Laura
Crews, MissGretchen Lyons, Miss Chris
tine Hill and Miss Ida Krueger.
Columbia.
There was much laughter last night at
the Columbia over the many absurdities
in that headless and tailless skit, "At Gay
Coney Island." Jack Campbell as Hi
Price, Tony Hart Jr. as i^enson Hurst
and Mark Hart as Mike Le Maque fur
nished the fun of the evening. The Daisy
Kidd-.-r of Mattle Lockette Is a lively
part, and she established herself at once
as a favorite in her Bongs and dances.
James H. Bradbury as Uncle Goodrich
Payne made up as a well-known Police
Court lawyer of this city and performed
the small part that fell to his lot in good
stylo.
There are enough women on the stage
to make trouble in any theater and they
may be summed up briefly as a lot of
pretty faces and eight good figures.
The whistling and barnyard imitations
by Alf Holt are inimitable.
Grand Opera-House.
Sutton Vane's latest play, "In Sight of
St. Paul's," was presented at the Grand
Opera-house last night to a well-filled
house. The event was marked by the first
appearance at that theater of Adele Bel
garde, the talented actress, who was lead
ing lady for Frederick Warde for several
seasons. She assumed the character of
Cynthia Dell, "the Panther," and played
it with such feeling and dramatic force
as to rouse the audience to flattering ex
pressions of their approval. She has lost
none of her old-time charm, and it is to
be regretted that she is not seen oftener
by those who admire her talents. Lorena
Atwoort as the heroine, Aileen Miller, was
aa usual clever and effective, and Marie
Winston, the soubrette, was pleasing as
Becky Vetch. James M. Brophy was the
maligned but vindicated hero, "and Lan
ders Stevens the polished villain. Both
sustained their parts creditably. Max yon
Mitzel had a congenial part as Gillie
Fletcher, and James Corrigan as the suf
fering father was worthy of praise. Fred
J. Butler had a small paft, but interpreted
It with his usual tact and intelligence. The
scenery is excellent,
Orpheum.
The Orpheum has an excellent pro
gramme this week. As usual, the man
agement presents a number of new faces
and features, retaining some of the best
who appeared last week. Maud Courtney,
who sings many of the old-time songs in a
quaint voice, is one of the new ones. Flo
Irwin, of grand physique and clever wit,
is still popular. Lillie Western, who i.Â« ad
vertised as the "premier musical artiste
of both hemispheres." is a whole show
herself. Her performance on the xylo
phone, concertina and bells, to say noth
ing of the snare drum, is highly artistic
Harry Larey and Miss Ida Van Sicklen
present "Bob Rlcketfs Pajamas." a little
comedy full of comical situations. The
Wilson family, high-class comedy coons
was warmly received. Fred T. Herbert's
troop of educatW <!ngs Is still one of the
best features of the show.
The Tivoli.
"Suzette" Is now enjoying ah excellent
production at the Tivoli, where it will
stay all the week, giving way on Monday
to "Cyrano."
New Comedy.
To-night is the night for the first pro
duction in San Francisco of "Cyrano de

What Mariani Wine Does to Soothe,
Strengthen and Sustain
the System.
Yin Mariani (Mariani Wine) is rec-
ommended as a tonic by the medical
profession all over the world. It has re-
ceived written recommendations from
more than 8000 American physicians.
Mariani Wine soothes, strengthens
and sustains the sjstem and braces
body and brain. It gives strength;
therefore may it be described as the
conqueror of disease and the promoter
of health and longevity.
Mariani Wine is specially indicated
.for malaria, fever and ague and all
miasmatic fevers. It promptly dispels
chills, abates malarial fever, and gives
a sense of buoyancy and vigor.
Mariani Wine is furthermore of es-
pecial value in cases, of Neuralgia, Ner-
vous Debility, Muscular Relaxation,
Mental and Physical Depression and
Exhaustion, Overwork or Overstrain,
Insomnia, Headache, Nervous Dyspep-
sia, Loss of Appetite, Emaciation and
Consumption. It builds up the vital
forces and is a powerful rejuvenator.
It gives strength to the nervous system,
firmness and elasticity to the muscles,
and richness to the blood. It benefits
all.
Mariani Wine is palatable and suited
to the most delicate stomachs. In the
cases of pale, puny, sickly children it
is invariably used with great benefit.
For overworked men and delicate
women Mariani W T ine works wonders.
Mariani Wine is sold by all Druggists.
Try it and you will find that It will well
sustain Its reputation. One word of
caution, however â let no representation
or explanation induce you to accept a
substitute. "Just as good" usually
leads to disappointment.
To every one writing to Mariani &
Co., 52 West Fifteenth street. New York
City, will be sent, free, if this paper
is mentioned, an interesting little book
containing portraits and autographs of
Emperors, Empress, Princes, Cardinals,
Archbishops and other distinguished
personages, indorsing Yin Mariani.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Nov. 21.â The upward move
ment of prices In the stock market was at full
tide to-day when the afternoon special editions
fcrought the Paris bulletin to the Associated
Press announcing that the president of the
Fpanlsh Peace Commission has declined to
proceed with the negotiations after the pre
sentation of the United States Commissioners'
final teroid. The professional room traders
turned reilcis immediately and the large buy
ing orders which were being executed all
around the room were apparently withdrawn.
Prices melted away quite rapidly In this con
dition of affairs, declines reaching nearly a
point in ma/iy cases. Supporting orders were
then placed in many of the leading stocks and
the decline was checked. There was no appar
ent disposition to continue the buying move
ment, however, and for a time during the last
hour the market fell into almost entire neg
lect. . This condition of affairs invited renewed
ehort selling and the drift was elowly down
ward to the close. The result is that many
stocks which were not conspicuously strong in
the early dealings closed lower than on Satur
day, while the notable advances in the leaders
are much reduced. Atchlson preferred easily
continued Its leadership of the railroad list,
and it made its way through a flood of offer-
Ings up 2VÂ» points to 47V4 before the Paris news
checked the advance. People's Gas reflected
also a very heavy demand and rose at one time
2VÂ», but saved less than a point in that gain.
The early movement of the market was con
fined very largely to special stocks, the
grangers and the recently awakened South
westerns halting somewhat. Northwestern was
an exception in the granger group and gained
2\ points, and its subsidiary company, St. Paul
and Omaha, rose nearly 2 points. The Balti
more and Ohio Issues also showed very
marked strength. Early in the afternoon Penn
sylvania sprang Into activity and made a
notable advance of 2V4 points, supplemented
closely by Pittsburg, Cincinnati, Chicago and
St. Louis preferred. This gave renewed tone
to the whole market and led to the strongest
upward movement of the day, the level of
prlreF being quite generally lifted near a point
over Saturday. The story of the reaction is
told above. Uneasiness over the money situa
tion in Berlin and the approaching maturity
of large obligations there had apparently sub-
Pided. The Northwestern railroad stocks were
relieved from pressure and the threatened rup
ture between Northern Pacific and Oregon
Navigation fell Into the background.
There was very large and well distributed
demand for bonds and some sharp advancer in
prices resulted, whi^h was well maintained to
the close in spite of the weakness in stocks.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. Nov. â Some hesitation was j
shown by wheat traders at the opening, though i
no decline in prices was noticeable except a I
slight shading of December. There was a j
prospect of a large increase in the world's vis- j
ible, and Northwest receipts were heavy. Liv
erpool started . lower, but. by the. time trading
here commenced the Liverpool quotations show
ed an advance, except for December, In which
there stllll ar*-Â°ared a slight decline. The i
signs of weakness at the start quickly dis- ;
appeared and the market for an hour was quite j
strong. About 11 o'clock : the market became
very firm. Both Russian and Danublan ship- j
ments showed a marked falling off, an Increase ;
In world's shipments, being altogether due !
to the heavy American shipments, and this
fact encouraged buyers. Strength which was I
shown by the coarser grain markets also had
a good deal of effect on trading. After the
market again quieted down prices were well
maintained. The Argentina news was bear
ish, a large crop being promised. Toward the !
close the market became very strong. Reports
that the Spanish Commissioners had broken off \
peace negotiations drove shorts to cover, and i
prices advanced, the best prices of the day j
prevailing at the close. May Is Vi@%c higher, i
and December %c.
Corn was. active and higher, helped by the |
large shipments, higher cables and bad weather â 
West. The outside trade showed a large in
crease while local interest was much greater.
May, closed Vie higher.
Oats were unusually active and strong. Cash I
demand was excellent. Offerings were small j
i and everything was quickly taken. May closed I
i %c higher.
Provisions were only fairly active but firm.
The advance In corn and oats was the chief in
fluence, but there was a good local and ship
ping demand. At the close January pork was
B%c higher, lard 7%c higher and January ribs
5@7%c higher.

J. J Keegan, who was appointed secre

and who has served in that capacity ever
bince then, replied to many questions pro
pounded by Senators Dickinson and
Prisk. The replies and the figures
presented brought to light the somewhat ;
t interesting but not startling intelligence I
that the expenses of water-front admin
istration have steadily increased from
year to year since ISai, while there has
been no increase, but on the contrary a j
decrease; in the annual revenues derived
from the wharves and privileges.
The pay-rolls, for example, indicate

ISM, the first entry of Belt Railroad ex

According to the testimony elicited, the I
new depot is an expensive institution to
maintain. The cost is $1750 a montn.
There are thirteen porters at $75 a month

Secretary Keegan, in the course of his
Testimony, said the force of his office con- i
sisted of a secretary, assistant secretary, |
bookkeeper, toll clerk and porter. Every
collector was supposed to make daily pay- i
ments of all money received. The secre
tary, in. explaining the methods of his
office, t*??tilied that all bills were paid in j
cash. Money received was deposited twice j
a week in the Crocker-Woolworth Hank ;
ai-.d was drawn out on the check of the

In answer to a question asked by Com
missioner Harney, Mr. Keegan said:
"There has never been a contract for lum

The afternoon session was devoted
chiefly to an inspection of the booKB and

and Harney assisted in explaining to the
Senators the methods, forms and checks
of the purchasing bureau. The inquiries
propounded by Senator Dickinson left the
â¢ impression that the committee believed
that the purchasing agent was buying
heavy hardware from James A. Snook &
Co. and Yale locks from Holbrook, Mer
rill & Stetson.
Senator Dickinson asked J. J. Flynn if
Holbrook, Merrill & Stetson dealt in Yale
locks, and the purchasing agent re
sponded:
"Grove Avers told me that the firm
dealt in Yale locks."
Questions were also asked about tha
purchase of wheelbarrows, mortise locks,
anjrie iron and many other articles. The
information was taken for future refer

HAVOC WROUGHT
BY A FLASHLIGHT
THE Golden Rule restaurant at 953 Market street was the scene of a
startling explosion yesterday morning at 11 o'clock. J. A. Robinson, a
photographer, was taking a flashlight pictuie of the Interior. when
the powder in the pan, hH<i by an assistant, exploded with a deafening
report as he ignited it. He was Htanding two or three feet away from the
swinging doors, which were ojjf-n, and was knocked ten feet put on the
sidewalk. He waa dazed for a few peconds, but picked himself up, finding
Ms hand only Blight!? injured by the fall. The powder pan went hurtling
through tIK- air and was found in the middle of the street, about fifty feet
away. That it did not strike any one in its flight is astonishing, as there
*â¢!â¢â  many people passing at the time.
The panes of glass in the doors were blown out and the top of a show
case standing on the counter was broken. A waitc-r In the place was
thrown to thÂ»: floor. He was deaft-ncd for five minutes after the occur-
Tl ; <- proprietor, M. Qaang. was at the telephone at the time and the
receiver wos knocked out of his hand. Several light fixtures were torn
away from the gas jets.
Robinson, th<; man who was takilng the picture, was not hurt, though
ho w:is standing two feel away from tho pan. He Is at a loss to know how
to account for the accident. He employed the ordinary preparation used
for flashlight pictures and this is the first time such a thing has ever hap
pened. The manner of lighting is to ignite a wad of ordinary cotton with a
match and this in turn acts fire to the powder, which is generally followed
by a puff of light accompanied by a slight report. He thinks the prepara
tion rery faulty.
The explosion created a small sized panic among the patrons who were
eating lunch and they lost no time In getting out of the restaurant, which
was filled with a thick, suffocating smoke. The report was heard three
blocks away and soon between two and three thousand people had congre
gated in the vicinity and Market street was impassable for nearly an hour.
AS A REFORMER
DELANY MEETS
WITH DISASTER
Eleven Supervisors
Go Against Him.
KILL HIS GAMING ORDER
DISREPUTABLE STREETS WILL
REMAIN OPEN.
Nickel-in-the-Slot Machines Will Not
Be Protected, However, as
Mr. Delany Had
Planned.
Eleven Supervisors kicked like broncos
yesterday against Captain Delany's anti
gambling resolution.
When it came up for consideration at
the meeting of the board as a part of the
alleged report of the Health and Police
Committee there was a quick attempt to
throttle it, Britt, Sheehan and Haskins
all taking part in the attack. Sheehan
and Haskins declared the Health and
Police Committee had never sanctioned
the resolution, that the majority of the
members were against it and that Cap
tain Delany had no right to include the
same in the committee's report. They de
i It was not properly before the !
i fur consideration.
Mayor Pliclan assented to this view of
the matter and ordered the resolution
thrown out At this juncture Supervisor
Clinton astonished the other members by i
announcing that he liked the resolution
much and would introduce it again
in regular fashion at the next meeting,
only eliminating that section which ex
empted the niekel-in-the-slot machines
from the sweeping prohibition against
gambling. This last proviso by Clinton I
â  i considerable amusement in the '
board, as it is well understood that De
lany's idea in introducing the order was
to throttle all forms of card and dice |
gambling in order to help out the patron- j
age Of the nickel-in-the-slot people. Dr.
Clinton increased Captain Delany's dis
gust by announcing In most laudatory
terms his appreciation of the rigid au.d
wholesome character of the movement to
secure moral purity in the city, as ex
emplifled in the Delany resolution, and
said he hoped it would prevail, all excep^
the nickel-in-the-slot proviso. He would
include nickel gambling machines in tae
prohibition. So far as Dr. Clinton could
.see. Captain Delany could well afford to
be s?atis:iÂ«d with gaining all his points
against gambling in this great city, and
an extra point besides.
It now looks as though the partial cru- :
sade against the gamblers begun by tne
captain would develop into a rreat and
all-pervading wave or reform, and that, ;
despite any objections on his part, De- â 
lany will be held up to view as an apostle
of moral purity and a shining example of.
what a good man can do when he sing's
hymns on Sunday and fights vice on Mon
day, j.
The Supervisors passed to the printer
by a unanimous vote the resolution
agreeing to pay the Sanitary Reduction
Company 20 cents per cubic yard for
garbageburned at the crematory. When
the vote was taken Rottanzi, Clinton and
Dodge had not arrived.
The Mayor's veto of the order provid
ing for the bituminizlng of Post street.
nr.ir Leavenworth, was laid .Gver for two
weeks.
The order prohibiting the sprinkling of
bitumen pavements by water carts was
returned to the Street Committee for
further consideration.
The recommendation of the License ana
Orders Committee that theater ticket
scalpers be allowed to ply their avoca
tion upon payment of a quarterly license
of $25 brought forth a vigorous protest |
from Rottanzi and Clinton, both of whom
di lured the theater managers objected
and that ticket scalpers swindled the pub
lic. The order was indefinitely postponed.
The action of the board providing for
the grading and macadaminzing of Nine
teenth street, from I to a point 500 feet
south of W street, was reconsidered and
the Superintendent of Streets was In
structed to begin anew formal proceed
ings looking to the accomplishment of the
work.
Shea & Shea, architects for the new
Hall of Justice, were instructed to pre
pare plans for giving the Police Depart
ment mure room and also to figure on the
furniture necessary to equip the build-
â¢ ing.
. i The Palace Athletic Club was granted
â¢ permission to hold a boxing exhibition In
\ December. The same privilege was ac
corded ro the Princeton Athletic Club and
. ( to the Mission Athletic Club.
The City Street Improvement Company
was awarded the contract for bituminiz
'â  Ing Market street from Taylor to Van
Ness for the sum of $31,000.
Supervisor Rottanzt Introduced a reso
lution requesting the Southern Pacific
! Railroad Company not to rebuild its
burned shops at Sacramento, but to re
move the entire plant to this city, In rec
ognition of the privileges granted by the
municipality In the past to the railroad.
The Supervisors finally decided that the
, dens on Bacon place and Belden place
! should be allowed to remain undisturbed.
Smith called up his motion to dose the
houses on these streets, claiming that
they were nuisances and ought to be sup
pressed. He declared that his resolution
I had been purposely sidetracked In com-
Sheehan, Rottanzi and several others
; took the ground that the closing of the
dens would scatter the disreputable in
mates broadcast over the town. They
thought it was better to segregate the
women. Upon putting the matter to vote
; Sheehan, Britt, Rottanzi, Rivers. Morton,
Delanv and Devany voted In favor of let
ting Bacon place and Belden place re
main open. Dodge, Lackmann, Smith
and Clinton voted to close both.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, TUESDAY, NOYEMBEK 22, 1898.
WIFE JOINS HUSBAND
BEHIND PRISON BARS
Mrs. Brandes Held, But Brandes Believed to Be
the Guilty One â A Lead-Bound
Club Used.
Mrs. Etta Brandes, stepmother of the
girl so brutally murdered at Berkeley
Saturday morning, was taken to Alameda
County Jail yesterday afternoon, where
she will be detained pending the verdict
of the Coroner's jury. This judicial body
will meet to-night in the small Morgue of
the university town to weigh the evidence-,
which seems to Indicate that the unfortun
ate child met her death at the hands of
either her father or her Btepmother.
Thus far the case resolves itself into
two questions: Who administered the
blows which proved fatal to Lillian Bran
des' life? And who tied the girl to the
bedpost, if, in fact, she were ever so sus
pended? Developments yesterday point
to the stepmother as equally guilty with
her husband in the crime that robbed the
unfortunate girl of her life.
Not only does she admit having thrash
ed the girl severely, but her story and
that of her husband are found to differ
in many particulars, showing that either
parent knows much more than has yet
been told. There are many important de
tails which must be explained. There is
much to be learned which nothing but
rigid cross-examination can bring out.
The whole fabric of the remarkable case
rests upon circumstantial evidence. No
person knows who killed the girl save the
man and the woman, who deny abso
lutely that their daughter met her death
in any other manner than by suicide.
They scoff at the suggestion that the
mere incident of her whipping on last
Wednesday is the direct cause of her
death. They both reiterate with but
slight variation of detail the fact that
she died by her own hand.
After carefully sifting- all the evidence
in their possession. Sheriff White and
District Attorney Charles E. Snook feel
convinced that the woman who was the
girl's stepmother Is too seriously impli
cated in the crime to be allowed "her lib-
erty.
When her hushand was taken from her
on Sunday night her actions betokened
stoical indifference, feebly disguised
under a mask of melodramatic grief at
his arrest. At that time It was arranged
for her to call at the jail yesterday after
noon with the understanding that she was
to be granted an audience with her hus
band.
She kept her tryst faithfui.y.
Acting under orders, the jailer did not
permit her to see her husband, and she
returned to her home. 3he had hardly
reached her cottage when Deputy Sheriff
Al White drove up in his buggy. He gave
the woman the impression she would see
her husband, and unwittingly she stepped
into the trap so artfully set by the repre
sentatives of the law.
In half an hour she was Bitting in a
comfortable waiting-room of the grim jail
anxiously i /raiting the moment when she
would meet her husband. While she
waited the ponderous machinery of the
law wan pot in motion. Deputy Sheriff
White and District Attorney Snook v;ere
in consultation. As the direct outcome of
their conference, Mr. hite telephoned
Jailer Page to detain Mrs. Brandes upon
the same ground that her husband was
held in custody.
The woman was still In Ignorance of her
standing in the jail. Shortly after she
was tola to follow an attendant upstairs,
which she did, requiring no assistance.
Aft^r anyther painful wait she was quiet
ly informed that she must remain there
until the result of the inijuept was known.
She grew hysterical and then tried to
work upon the sympathies of her jailer.
She called him a good, kind man, and
begged to be taken to her husband.
This request was denied. The authorl
DISTRIBUTION OF
J. Z. DAVIS' ESTATE
IT IS FINALLY OBDERED BY
JUDGE COFFEY.
Deeds to About Two Million Dollars'
Worth of Property Pass With
the Decree.
Through an order made by Judge Cof
fej" yesterday Mrs. John M. Curtis and
Miss Lizzie Muir were placed in posses
sion of the residue of the estate of the
late Jacob Z. Davis, valued at about |900,
000. The order of the court conveys legal
title to all of the Thurlow block. Kearny
and Sutter streets, valued at$400,000; Koh
,ler & Frohllng winery building, Becond
and Folsom streets, valued at $160,000; a
mortgage of 130,000 on the Lissack prop- ]
ties will prevent the unhappy couple from
communicating with each other until
they have given their testimony at the
Inquest. It is expected that from their
possible contradictions may come the true
narrative of the killing of their daughter.
The woman is confined in a large room
with two female prisoners. Her condi
j tion has bordered on the hysterical since
| the arrest of her husband. For this rea
! son no one has been allowed to see her,
as it was feared any undue excitement
would oause her to collapse. She Is
theatrical to an extreme in all her move-.
I ments, seeming always to strive after ef
i feet. The boon of tears came to her yes
terday and she sobbed bitterly at times.
Her neighbors and her relatives in this
city have held aloof from her in her hour
of trouble. The cruelty of the crime and
the previous standing of the couple have
resulted in their being ostracised. The
! only helping hand extended to the woman
| has been that of Mrs. Kennedy, a sweet
faced woman of Berkeley. She spent yes
: terday morning with Mrs. Brandes. She
waited in vain for the woman's return.
Whf-n news finally reached her of the
| woman's detention, Mrs. Kennedy de-t
I termined to remain in the house as care
1 taker until the inquest develops the fu
ture movements of the man and the
woman suspected of the murder. The
only remaining child, a box of about 10
years, is still at the house, and to all ap
pearances does not understand the mean
ing of all the commotion caused by the
death of his sister and playmate.
William Alfred Brandes' night in jail
left him dejected and broken spirited. He
is confined in a small room over the office
of the jail and can move about the corri
dors at will. His bed is a rough mattress
on the floor. He reiterates over and over
that he is innocent of the crime of which
he is suspected. He charges a number
of men in Berkeley with trying to rail
road him to jail in an attempt to break
! up his business as a private patrolman.
Wh(>n asked to explain certain diacrep
; ancles between statements he had made
ho said his brain seemed on fire; that he
was in no condition at any time to make
a clear statement of his movements
etthf-r before or after that fateful moment
when he entered his daughter's bedroom
' and found her, as he maintains, suspend
i ed from the bedpost. He thinks Dr. Whit-
I worth's statement that the girl died of
strangulation should be accepted, as he
examined her body immediately after It
was cut down. Dr. Whitworth's examina
tion at this time was a superficial one
and not to be compared to the careful re
i search of the six surgeons who were pres
! ent at the autopsy.
Brandes' dinner of coarse prison fare
was on the floor near his bed, and from
appearances had not been touched by him.
It was long past the hour when his wife
had promised to visit him, and her non
appearance worried him. He said she
: would surely come, little knowing that at
that moment she was within call of his
voice and yet could not speak to him.
He reverted to the stories of his life in
Rausalito, where he was charged with
brutality and was finally compelled to
! leave the town. He claimed these to have
been exaggerated and as having no bear
' ing on his present crime. As to his
change of name, he said that was done
when he was working on detective cases
where he could not secure certain evi
dence if he used his proper name. On these
occasions he simply spelled his name
backward.
He maintains that the wounds on the
girl's body were caused when she dangled
at the on<J of the aprons with which she
is supposed to have hanged herself.
The policf in their investigations yester
day found the implement with which the
girl was murdered. This is a heavy po
lice club, weighted with lead and the
[ whole covered thickly with soft leather.
This explains the nature of the frightful
wounds on the head which caused the
Kirl's death. Although there waa no
erty on Turk street; a mortgage of $159,
000 on the Odd Fellows' building, Market
and Seventh streets, and cash and bonds
sufficient to bring the value of their share
of the estate up to $900,000.
This amount includes their share of the
assets of Boyd & Davis, with the excep
tion of $30,000, which they seek to recover
from Alexander Boyd for interest on
overdraft since the death of Davis.
Alexander Boyd also comes Into posses
sion of assets of the firm of Boyd & Davis
valued at over $900,000, which includes sev
eral valuable real estate holdings.
Mark Thall's Benefit.
To-night will be a big event for the little
theater on O'Farrell street. The full force
of .the Alcazar stock company will be

edy "Imagination" is to be presented for

break of either the scalp or the skull,
there was hemorrhage of the brain and
a disturbance on its surface. The cover
ing of the club removed the possibility of
a fracture of the skull.
Lewis Long and Timothy McKeown will
be Important witnesses for the prosecu
tion. They will testify to having heard
blows administered and curses from a
man. This was sufficiently late in the
week to be connected with the murder
on Friday night.
Two women were in the house at the
time. One of these was Mrs. Brandes;
the other is expected to be present at the
inquest. Deputy Sheriff Al. White is con
fident that from the evidence introduced
at the Coroner's inquest Brandes will con
fess-to having administered the blows
which caused the death of his daughter.
The hour for the funeral of the dead girl
has not been fixed yet. The burial will
take place some time to-morrow in Moun
tain View Cemetery. A subscription Is
being taken up in Berkeley to defray the
expenses of the funÂ«ral. The inquest to
night will be held by Coroner Baldwin, the
prosecution being represented by District
Attorney Charles E. Snook.
J. S. Harvey appeart-d voluntarily before
the District Attorney this afternoon and
made a sworn statement covering his
knowledge of the incidents leading up to
the death of the girl.
Toward midnight Mrs. Brandes v nerves
were in such condition that Dr. W. S.
Porter, the county physician, was sum
moned to administer a potion. When Dr.
Porter stepped into the cell, however,
Mrs. Brandes suddenly braced up and
showed no symptoms requiring- medical
aid. She <--a seem worried, and as she
leaned against the door frame of her cell,
her arms snugly folded and her large eyes
staring indifferently to the floor, she pre
sented a picture of a conscience-stricken
mortal. Dr. Porter suggested that per
haps he had better prepare her some-
thing that would quiet her nerves and
aid her to enjoy a night's rest.
"Oh, no, doctor," said Mrs. Brandes. "I
guess I'll be all right after a while"; but
her face, as she looked up and the clear
light shed Its rays upon it, looked hazard
âalmost emaciated. Dr. Porter again
urged her to take a potion, and though
she had at first complained of not' being
able to sleep she now remarked that she
"hadn't tried tp sleep yet," and finally,
after further persuasion, stie said, ' >> ell,
all right, doctor; you may bring mo
something."
Further than admitting to Deputy
Sheriff Al White that she felt responsible
for the girl's death, admitting: that she
had administered the awful beating,
which Bhe "feared had led Lil to commit
suicide," Mrs. Brandes would say abso
lutely nothing directly to the point.
Dr. porter also went to Mr. Brandes'
cell. Brandes was lying covered up snug
ly under thick blankets in one corner of
the cell reading a novel. "Wouldn't you
like to have me prepare you something
before you go to sleep?" asked the phy
sician.
"Yes, doctor," replied the prisoner,
frankly. "I'll tell you what I wish you'd
give me. Give me a drink of whisky. I
know it will assist me to sleep. â  Oh, yes.
I wteh, too. If you would, please, give
my wife something."
''Yfs, I shall give her a preparation to
niakr her sleep, said Dr. Porter, assur
"l'iut don't put any morphine in It/*
suggested the prisoner; "we don't need
it. My wife is used to taking a drink of
whisky just before retiring. It makes her
sleep better. But whatever you do don't
put any drug In the whisky, or she will
be way off in the morning. I am pretty
tired myself. They had me hanged all
day. About seventy-five people have been
in "here to see me, and the papers have
a man convicted before ever he is tried."
The door of Brandes' cell closed again,
and the physician left to prepar* the
potion.
teen months ago everybody thought the i
house was about to close its doors, but
Belasco summoned Thall to his aid and
the result is known to everybodyâ the
house stands to-day one of the stanchest
in the city. Mr. Thai! is naturally be
loved by ail the Alcazar people and those
who go lato to-night will have great diffi
culty.in securing seats.

ALAMEDA COUNTY NEWS.
KEYES TELLS
OF THE MAN
HE ARRESTED
A Mustache Proves It
Was Not Reddy.
ASSAILANT STILL AT URGE
OFFICER CRITICIZED FOR NOT
SEARCHING FOR ARMS.
Theory Is Advanced That the Man
Who Was Arrested May Hare
Been a Citizen Who Feared
Robbery.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
Broadway, Nov. 21.
Who shot Keyes?
This problem is perplexing the police of
ficials of this county. Everybody !6 sat-
Isfied that in the midnight encounter dur
ing which Keyes emptied his revolver and
received several shots in return the other j
man was not John P. Reddy. who is now
In the County Jail. During the past month
there have been several burglaries and
robberies reported, but no one has been
arrested for the crimes.
It is now presumed that by a strange
coincidence Officer Koyes arrested one of
the burglars while looking for Reddy and
that when the two men were in a dark
place the prisoner opened lire and after
exchanging shots made his escape. Keyes
Is criticized for not searching his man
when he arrested him at Seventh and
Market streets. It is customary when ar
g a man charged with felony to
search him. and had Keyes done this in
the public place where he made the arrest
he would probably have escaped injury
and discovered later that ht- had arrested
by accident a hard character. Instead of
doing this, Keyes was walking with his
man toward the Alameda streetcar with
tb,e intention of taking him to the Ala
meda jalL The prisoner was evidently re
to defend himself, and his readi
.vith his revolver suggests that he
was a criminal of some sort.
Another theory has been advanced to
account for the shooting of Keyes. At
the time of the assault Keyes was in
citizen's clothes. He is a member of the
Alameda police force and unknown in
Oakland. Jt is possible that the man he
had under arrest was suspicious that he
was merely bt-ing led by some one imper
. :ig an officer into the darkness sur
rounding- Jefferson square for the purpose
of being robbeu and that he used his re
volver \n save himself. If this were the
it is more than likely that ihe un
knov.-n man would have come forward i>y
this time and explained the affair, and
that he has not done so rather robs this
. of its foundation.
Idy ha? maue a complete statement
of his defense. He tells in detail just
what lie did since having Mrs. Shattuck's
:n Alameda last Friday afternoon
until arrested in San Jose Saturday morn-
Ing. Every move has been verified, and
his alibi is complete. He is evidently not
a man troubled with contentious scru
ples, for he admitted that he intended to
â¢ his family and start life anew
boiu where rise under an assumed name.
"When 1 knew that the warrant for as-
Baulting little Irene Shattuck was issued."
said Reddy, "I mane up my mind to take
the name of John Sweet. I left Oakland
without taking a thing from n.y house.
I made up my mind to desert my wife
and child, leave everything and start life
anew, beo me time my wife and
J have not lived together happily. I am
inn Â»cent of this shooting and was never
arr< si '-'i by Keyes."
Keyes has not yet been able to make a
â¢ â¢:it.
This evening Officer Keyes was able to
speak a little and he told Detective Hol
land ot hi 6 arresting the man who shot
him.
"While I was on watch at Maraket
street." said Kqyes, "I saw a man come
up Market street from Sixth. He stopped
in front of Reddy's bouse. It swms to me
that h<; saw Officer Sill and turned back
toward Sixth street. I followed him and
arrested him on :iixth street, betwe n
Market and Brush. 1 placed my hand on
his shoulder and said: 'Reddy, you are
under arrest. 1 He replied: 'You have the
wrong man.' We had some trouble on
Sixth street, and then I grot him up to
Brush and Seventh. Then the fight began.
Reddy looks like the man I arrested, only
my prisoner had a mustache."
HIS HEART TOO SMALL
TO PERFORM ITS DUTY
EEMARKABLE FREAK OF G. B.
CORDOZA.
.
His Growth of Three Inches in Three [
Months Made His Heart Beat
Audibly.
OAKLAND. Nov. 21.â The anatomy of |
George R. Cordoza, a LTivermore boy, j
aged 14 years, who died last Friday, Is
one that by medical men is regarded as
most remarkable. His death is attributed
to an abnormal development of the body, j
In three months he gained three inches j
in stature, and Dr. J. M. Buchers. who
was the attending physician. Rives it as j
his opinion that death was approximately i
the result of the hoy's heart being unable
to perform the function of supplying the
rapid development of the body.
Several months ago the boy's parents
became alarmed over the violent oeatlng
of his hf-art, which was audible a dis
tance of .several feet, and was a source
of much anxiety to Cordoza's teacher.
Miss Maggie M< Kee.
Tlnniph lÂ«ut 14 years of age, the lad
stood 5 feet 10 Inches i;i his stocking feet.
CALLED HEE A "CHIPPY."
Pitiful Testimony by Mrs. Olvedo in
Her Suit for Divorce.
OAKLAND. Nov. 21.â The divorce suit
of Mrs. Maria R. Olvedo against Manuel
Olvedo on the ground of extreme cruelty
wai partially ti n 3uperioi Judge
Ogden this aft* i : the testimony
of the plaintiff was pitiful to hear.
Mrs. Olvedo was the mother of four lit
tle children and th family resides at
>>"â¢â *. Some time ago one of the little
ones was killed in a runaway accident and
she was also injured quite seriously.
"Though we have never lived happily to
gether." said Mrs. Olvedo to-day, "my
husband became particularly cruel after
the death of the child.
' "Ho called mo a chippy and a dog and
accused me of infidelity. He refused to
have a doctor attend our sick child, Bay
iivr; he never had a doctor attend to his
ailments. Finally he refused to pay the
water bill and 1 was compelled to go to
my neighbors for water with â  which to
make tea." Witness also testified that
he had frequently struck her and that her
health had b^on affected Â«s a result.
The trial will probably be concluded to
morrow. The defendant some time ago
filed a cross-complaint In which lie
charges abandonment.

AN ILLEGAL WILL.
I By Its Annulment John Lindstrom
and C. A- Tripp Will Fare
Much Better.
OAKLAND, Nov. 21.â The will of the
late Mrs. Nellie Lundstrom was declared
an Illegal Instrument to-day by Judge
Ellsworth.
It appearÃ from the testimony that the
subscribing witnesses â Agnes O. Ryan
and Ada F. Carthy, nurses at the Fabio
la Hospital, where testatrix died â had not
signed the will dated October 25, IS9B, in
the presence of testatrix, as required by
law. The estate consists of $1000 cash on
deposit and real estate valued at $6000.
By the tery.s of the will provisions were
made for a deaf mute daughter in Gal
laudet College, New York, the husband,
John lindstrom, and a son, Charles Al
fred Tripp in Company H, First Califor
nia Volunteers. By the annulment of the
will the husband and son will receive a
larger portion than was provided for by
its terms.
O. J. Denison, a real estate man. who
drew up the will, immediately applied for
letters of administration and has already
the nomination from the widower.
POLITICS RESULT IN A
BARE-F!ST BATTLE
PROMINENT ALAMEDANS SET
TLE A DISPUTE.
A Campaign Argument Decided by
a Spirited Six-Round Contest
With Bare Knuckles.
ALAMKDA, Nov. 21.â One of the un
pleasant features of the late campaign de
veloped last evening in a genuine prize
fight, in which Lai Schuler, a prominent
member of the Young Men's Republican
Club and a well-known politician of West
Alameda, and S. K. Thompson, who had
a position on the opposite side of the
political fence, took part.
The fight came off at the headquarters
of the Young Men's Republican Club in
the old Neptune Gardens, before a select
audience of twelve, all of whom were
pledged to secrecy.
Schuler and Thompson had a difficulty
over politics early in the campaign. Their
argument was heated, and they were
about to come to blows when their
friends separated them. It was agreed
then that after the smoke of the political
battle had cleared away the pair would
settle their difficulties In a six-round
rough-and-tumble contest.
Both mfti have been preparing for the
event with considerable diligence, and
their friends have been lotiking forward
to the affray with much impatience. Joun
Croll was selected as referee. A gentle
man named Walker acted as Schuler's
second, and Thompson was backed by
George Brltt.
From start to finish the contest was
spirited. Schuler. who was much the
smaller of the pair, put up a fight that
surprised the audience. After the fourth
round he had things all his own way, and
administered severe punishment to rf-;
antagonist. Just before time was calk.l
in the sixth round Thompson's second
throw up the sponge, and the political
argument was decided in Schuler's favor.
The men fought with bare knuckles.
Davie Improving.
OAKLAND, Nov. 21.â Manuel Davle,
who was shot by HnriiTlo Paul In Tcmes
cal last night, is resting easy to-night at
the Receiving Hospital. Dr. J. M. Kane
probed for the two bullets again to-day,
but has about given up all hope of locat
ing and extracting them without necessi
tatlng an operation that may prove dan
gerous. Tin- wounded gardener suffered
nn hrmorrhaÃPF to-day, and bids fair to
recover, though hf may have to carry thÂ«
missiles in his body through life. Paul.

Succumbs to Overwork.

I ILLIAM E. BON"D. business manager of the Anaconda Standard, who I
\fU was visiting: Oakland for the benefit of his health, died at the home i
Â» 1 of Hon. W. E. Dargie In East Oakland this morning. The direct i
cause of death was extreme nervous prostration, brought about by I
overwork, and this produced other ailments. Mr. Bond came to Oakland . i
about two months ago, and it was thought he was regaining his energies; i
but during the past few days his illness became more pronounced, and al- i
though several physicians attended him. his system was too much shattered i
to allow of recovery. i
Mr. Bond was well known on this coast as an energetic and successful i
newspaper man. For many years he was business manager of the Oak- i
land Tribune, and after going to Montana he materially Improved the i
business status. of the Anaconda Standard. He was born in Petaiuma i
thirty-seven years ago, and about six years ago married Miss Ruby Dore. .*.'(

When death came Mr. Bond was surrounded by all of his family. "â  i

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 22, 1898.
HIS ARREST
MAY MAR HIS
HONEYMOON
J. Havermeyer Eck
ley's Predicament.
HE HAS IGNORED A CITATION
REPORTED TO HAVE MARRIED
PRANKIE J. TAYLOR.
Says His Ex-Wife Has Disposed of
His Property to the Extent
of Two Thousand
Dollars.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Nov. 21.
John Havemeyer Eckley, from whom
Etta Louise Eckley of Alameda obtained
a divorce about a month ago, Ims, if re
ports are correct, taken another wife In
the person of Mrs. Frankie J. Taylor.
Their marriage Is supposed to have been
solemnized in Reno, New, to-day. In
stead Eckley should haye appeared before
Superior Judge Hall on a citation to show
cause why he should not be held guilty of
contempt In failing to pay $100 monthly
alimony to his divorced wife.
When the matter was called up in Judge
Hairs court to-day Attorney P. Benson
appeared on behalf of Eckley and J. R.
Aiken represented Mrs. Eckley's interests,
though the lady was present in person.
Attorney Aiken stated that he had in
formation from reliable sources that Eck
ley and Mrs. Frankie J. Taylor had left
for Reno, Nev., last Friday night with
the purpose of marrying. Enlightenment
on the subject was asked for from Eck-
I ley's attorney, but the latter preferred not
I to" answer, though he did not deny Aiken's
statement. It is understood that .Airs.
Taj* lor was also divorced about a month
ago and that she was formerly the wife of
j a wealthy cattleman.
I Judge Hall allowed the matter to go
! over xor hearing until to-morrow morning
i at 10 o'clock, but intimated that Eokley
would be held for -contempt. Eckley,
therefore, is liable to be taicen to the
County Jail on his return for having
failed "to settle accounts with his first
wife.
In his answer to the ex-wife's petition
j for a citation, filed by his attorney to-day,
! Eckley alleges that he has no money for
| the alimony asked for, and that he can
i spare no more than $30 monthly at best,
j since he has been out of employment dur
j Ing the past six months and is dependent
j upon his parents for support. On the
i other hand Mrs. Eckley asserts that her
, ex-husband make? books on the races and
i conducts an establishment on Post street,
San Francisco.
J. Havermeyer Eckley In his answer also
â¢ dpnies his ex-wife's charges of improper
conduct with Mrs. Frankie Taylor, who he
: says "is a lady of respectability, good
character and in good standing in society;
and that Mrs. Taylor and defendant have
agreed to become husband and wife, and
; by reason of such fact defendant and Mrs.
! Taylor have very properly often met and
sometimes had their meals In respectable
restaurants, which no persons but re
spectable people and citizens of good re
pute frequent for the purpose of dining."
j He denies that he lived extravagantly or
' hart sufficient money to make books on the
races.
The statements made by Mrs. Eckley
which rpfer to Mrs. Taylor Mr. Eckley
: charges "are unjust, untrue and without
foundation, and made, as affiant verily
j believes, with intent of libeling, aspersing
and injuring the good name or Mrs. Tay
lor."
Eckley then gees on to charge his wife
with having disposed during last June of
$2000 worth of household furniture In Ala
: rnf-da he-longing to him. and with holding
| other personal property worth $340.
In his prayer ho asks that plaintiff take
i nothing, that the order to show cause be
I dismissed, and that plaintiff be required
I to account for the disposed property.
The ex-wife, however, asserts that she
realized but $21." from the sale of the fur- ;
niuir". and that she was compelled to sell \
this to raise money for her support.
Judge Hall did not seem to place much
weight on Eckley's affidavit and issued j
another citation. What adds still mire
interest to the case at this stage is that
Mrs. Ecklpy has, since the divorce decree
was granted, received several letters from
Eckley which her attorney regards as
containing threats.
CEMETERY CREEK AGAIN.
Oakland's Councilmen Pass Another
Resolution Looking Toward
Its Improvement.
OAKLAND. Nov. 21.â The City Council
to-night accepted the right of way for a
sewer from Twenty-fourth street to the
main lake sewer. This is the first step ;
toward the improvement of Cemetery
Creek. The City Engineer was directed to
prepare plans for the construction of a
waterway through the Twelfth street dam
opposite the proposed channel in connec
tion with the dredging of Lake Merritt.
and $499 was appropriated for the building
of a retaining wall on Shore avenue. ,
NOTARIES MUST PAY THE TAX
Verifications on Superior Court
Pleadings Must Bear a Ten-
Cent Stamp.
A question of great Interest to attor
neys, notaries and litigants has just been
settled by the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue, Some protest has been made
to the requirement of a ten-cent stamp on
the notaries' certificates to verified plead
ings filed in the Superior Court. To settle
the matter E. M. Galvin of this city ap
plied to N. B. Scott, Commissioner of In
ternal Revenue, Washington, D. C, for a
ruling on the question. Collector Lynch
has received a reply, as follows:
"In reply to letter which this office has
received from E. M. Galvin of San Fran
cisco, who inquires whether a revenue
stamp is required upon a notary's verifi
cation to an answer in a civil action
pending in the Superior Court of Califor
nia, you are directed to inform him that
as this verification is required by the
laws of California it requires a ten cent
stamp under the act of June 13. 1898. Mr.
Gnlvin tms been referred to you for thÂ«
Information requested."
WANTS A DAUGHTER'S
SHARE OF THE ESTATE
ANOTHER DE LAVEAGA HEIR
MAKES HER APPEARANCE.
Claims She Is the Only Legitimate
Offspring of the Deceased
Capitalist.
Another claimant to a portion of the j
vast estate of Jose Vicente de Laveaga !
put In an appearance yesterday and fur- i
ther complicated the content over the dis
tribution of the estate by praying the
court to make an order directing the ex
ecutors to render a final account and dis
tribute to her a daughter's share of the
estate. The new claimant appears under
the name of Dolorts Apolonia de Rivera.
She avers that she is the daugh
ter and only legitimate offspring
of Jnse Vicente de Laveaga. She
was born in this State on April 10,
1872, she further alleges, and, notwith
standing the fact that she was not men
tioned in the will of the deceased, which
she declares to be a forgery, she asks
that the right be granted her to estab
lish her allegations and her right to the
residue of her father's estate.
When the petition of the claimant was
presented objection to Its being filed was
made, and Judge Coffey set next Friday
as the. date for argument on the legal
points Involved. Graves & Graves, W. L.
Pierce and Lloyd & Wood have been re
tained by the alleged daughter of the de
ceased capitalist in the case if the court
does not deny them the right to make an
appearance. A bitter contest on behalf
of the young woman is anticipated.
IS RESTING EASILY.
Durie Heithier Will Probably Re
cover From Her Wounds.
Durie Heithier is resting easily in her
cot at the German Hospital, and the
physicians at that Institution to whom
Dr. Conrad Well has turned over the
case have every hope for her speedy re
covery. The bullet has been located and
will be removed as soon Â«s the condition
of the patient will warrant the operation.
The young lady had no fever yesterday,
and seemed in less pain than at any time
.-Â»inrÂ». hfr attempted suicide. It is the
opinion of Dr. Weil that the bullet struck
and broke a rib after passing through the
lung, and to this fact the great suffering
she has experienced is attributed.
Judgment Reversed.
The Supreme Court has reversed the
judgment and order of the Superior Court
of Santa Clara in the case of Jessie Pyle
against Edward M. Piercy. The woman,
secured judgment for $12,000 for breach of
promise to marry, but the Supreme Court
decided that there was an error in the
lower court in the matter of admitting
certain testimony.

HOPE FOR THE
OVERDUE SHIP
LAURELBANK
The Prosper'sCaptain
Thinks He Saw Her.
I MANY VESSELS IN HARD LUCK
COMPELLED TO PUT INTO WAY
PORTS FOR REPAIRS.
Arrival of the Steamer Coptic From
China, Japan and Hawaii With
Many Distinguished
Passengers.
â¢The hopes of the gamblers In reinsur
ance were raised yesterday by the arrival
of the schooner Prosper at Port Towns
end. The British ship Laurelbank is now
out S2 days from Shanghai for Portland,
Or., and 90 per cent reinsurance has been
paid on her. The captain of the Prosper
thinks that in latitude 34 north, longitude
143 east, on October 2S, he saw the Laurel
bank heading northeast. He describes
her as 'gray-colored, painted-port, four
masted bark, with double topgallant
yards and no royals." The captain is not
sure, but thinks the vessel he saw was
the Laurelbank. At the time the prevail
ing wind was from the south and very
strong. There was a heavy sea running.
If this vessel proves to be the Laurelbank
it will be a great thing for the men who
have purchased risks from the under
writers.
Vessels on the way to Pacific Coast
ports and Honolulu seem to ha\e hard
luck this year. The Valkyrlan, truxn
Newcastle, Australia, for Iqulque, is now
out 104 days, and S5 per cent reinsurance
has been paid. The Samoena is out 62
days from Nagasaki for Astoria, and i>o
per cent Is being paid on her, while S per
cent is being paid on the Scottish Hills,
now ISO dayÃ out from Hamburg for San
Francisco.
Other vessels In hard luck are the
American ship Republic, which started
for Honolulu from .Newcastle, but had to
put into Sydney, N. S. W., with her bo-w
ports leaking-. The British bark Anam
bra, 135 days out from Liverpool for
Honolulu, had to put into Montevideo on
September 16, having been damaged in a
hurricane and the crew sick. The British
ship Wallacetown, from Antwerp for San
Francisco, 149 days out, had to put into
Coquimbo on October 19 Wim her steering
gear badly damaged. The British ship
Kontcnburn, 139 days out from Swansea,
had to put into Rio de Janeiro with her
cargo shifted. She sailed again on Oc
tober 9. The British snip Crown of India,
from Newcastle, Australia, for San Fran
cisco, was dismasted last May in a hurri
cane and had to put Into Syuney for re
pairs. Hit new spars arrived In Australia
on September 29 last, and the vessel Is
now about ready to continue her voyage.
The British ship Eaton Hall, 144 days out
from Swansea for San Francisco, had to
put into Rio de Janeiro on September 3
with her decks damaged and ncr boats
sw>-pt away. Besides these the American
bark Georye F. Manson, from Sydney for
San Francisco, has been given up as lost,
so all in all it has been a bad time for
shipping the last three montns.
The many friends of Captain Mclntyre
will be glad to hear that he is able to be
about again. Just before his ship. Clan
Graham, was ready to sail he was taken
very ill and had to be removed to St.
Mary's Hospital. He has been there for
seven weeks, and was able to leava the
institution for the first time yesterday.
In a week or so he expects to leave for
England via New York, arid will rejoin
hi? ship in Liverpool.
News r. â ached the city yesterday of the
death of Captain Cross of the British ship
Eulomene. A better-liked master never
came to this port, and his host of friends
will be sorry to hear of his death. Cap
tain Cross left the Eulomene on her last
v , Iva p P and dk-d in Lorrlon of inflamma
tion of the bowels. Tho Eulomene is
now on the Columbia River loading wheat
First Mate L<e MonohW of the French
bark President Thiers had a narrow es
cape for his life on Sunday nig-ht. A num
ber of the crew deserted during the week,
and on Sunday th" matt> went to look
them up. The bark is lying at Beale
street wharf; but L.c Monchier, when he
started to look for her on Sunday night,
got turned around and landed at Lom
bard-street wharf. While looking around
for his vessel he fell overboard, and had
it not been for the crew of the revenue
cutter Golden Gate he would have drown
ed They fished him out of the bay more
dead than alive, and after reviving him
and drying his clothes one of their num
ber helped him navigate to the President
Thiers at Beale street. Yesterday a spe
cial officer put the runaway sailors back
aboard the bark.
The new schooner Mascot, for the South
Sea Island trade, came down from Tur
ner's shipyard yesterday. She is a sister
boat to the Queen of the Isles, and Is in
tended for trading in the New Britain
group. Her headquarters will be at Ma
tupa, and a vessel from Jaluit, In the
Mars'nalls. will meet her twice a year.
Captain D. Schwarting will take tha
Mascot to New Britain.
The cruiser Philadelphia will sail for
Central American ports to-day. If the
war in San Salvador amounts to anything
she will be there to protect American in
terests. All her stores were put on board
yesterday, so she should get away with
the early morning tide.
The Occidental and Oriental Company's
steamer Coptic arrived from Hongkong
via Yokohama and Honolulu yesterday,
a day ahead of schedule time.
She made the run from Yokohama to
Honolulu in the good time of 9 days, 13
hours and 32 minutes, and came to San
Francisco in 6 days, 1 hour and 47 minutes.
She brought up sixty-five cabin, thirty
one second cabin and 10S, Chinese In the
steerage. Among those in the cabin were
ex-Queen LiliuoKalani, Rev. Father B.
Dougherty and Paul Neumann. Father
Dougherty went away with the soldier
boys, and returns for a short vacation.
The ex-Queon is here In connection with
the annexation of Hawaii and her claim
against the United States Government,
and Paul Neumann Is here in her inter
ests and also in connection with the es
tate of his nephew, Rudolph, who was
killed on the island of Unga last month.
W. B. Curtis comes from Japan to rep
thr- Toyo Risen Kalsha (Orietnnl
Steamship Company) here. This concern
is heavily subsidised by the Japanese
Government, and 13 going to run three
steamers in conjunction with three of the
Pacific Mail and three of the Occidental
and Oriental steamers. A description of
these vessels and combined schedule of
sailing dates was published exclusively in
The Call over a month ago. Mr. Curtis
was formerly manager of the California
Traffic Association, and was at one time
in the freight department of tho Southern
Pacific.

NEFF IS TO BE AGAIN
THE MINERS' PRESIDENT
First Day of the Annual Convention Results
in Radical Changes in the Politics
of the Association.
Promptly at 30:80 yesterday morning a
li\'ely tattoo from the gavel of Presi
dent Jacob Neff called to order the dele
gates of the California Miners' Associa
tion who had gathered at X. S. G. "W.
Hall and the seventh annual convention
â¢was convened.
Fully 250 delegates, representing the
seventeen mining counties of the State,
â were on hand and every one was in his
seat when with a few kindly words of
good fellowship President Neft Intro
duced Mayor Phelan, who had come to
welcome the miners to the city and every
thing In It for bo long as they may choose
to stay.
The entire day was occupied In dispos
ing of the immense amount of routine
work that precedes the actual business
of the convention. Nothing of the poll
tics that has for the past few weeks
stirred the association was apparent at
the meeting. That was all taken care of
on the outside, and In It there were some
Interesting developments. Julian Sonn
tag and W. C. Ralston, who have been
engaged in such a lively fight for the
presidency, were called off by the an
nouncement that Mr. Neff was to be re
elected by acclamation and that he had
practically decided to accept in order to
quiet the ill feeling that the fight for his
succession had engendered.
The election Is called for 2:30 this after
noon, and the plan of the leaders of the
convention is to place the name of their
veteran chief in nomination and call for
his election by acclamation. There will
be no opposition, and if Mr. Neff finally
consents to the plan he will certainly be
elected. So far the scheme has pro
gressed against the wishes of tha presi
dent. Mr. Neff has said time and again
that under no circumstance would he ac
cept re-election, but yesterday the 111 feel
ing that has risen out of the fight for his
vacant chair was pointed out to him and
n order that there shall be no dissensions
resulting from the session of this year he
may be Induced to reconsider his deter
mination. If he does both Sonntag and
Ralston will do him honor with the rest
of their fellows and give way in his favor
without protest.
The fight for the secretaryship Is as
warm as ever between Turner and Ben
jamin. Ralston is still trying to swing
his protege into lime, but is meeting with
the opposition of a majority of the votes
that are represented at the convention
and it looks as though the honors are to
go to Turner.
Mayor Phelan's address opened the
business of yesterday's session. His
words were not many, but they were to
the point and well received. In bidding
the miners welcome he said:
It affords me great pleasure to welcome you

to the city of San Francisco. This city is in
debted to the miners of California for its very
birth as well as its development. This penin
sula was condemned as a place of residence
sixty years agro because of a scarcity of fertile
soil, of fuef and of, water. But the miners
flocked here, pitched their tents in the sand
hills, and from here went to the mines. They
must have reparded the -'ace with affection,
for they returned with their gold and sought
investments here.

NEF=I= WILL PRESIDE
FOR ANOTHER YEAR
$ j "11 JT R. XEFF will certainly be re-elected to the presidency of our asso
l\/l Nation," said Judge Walling of Nevada County last evening:. "The |
S? IYI boy 3 have got the plan all fixed up among them, and when the elec
it -*-"-*- tion is held to-morrow afternoon ha will be chosen by acclamation 1
?2 and we won't take no for an answer.
fj "Mr. Neff has said that he would not consider a proposition to succeed
?J himself. Naturally he feels a certain delicacy in accepting the presidency
jj of a body of this sort since he- has been elected to the Lieutenant Gov
82 ernorship. but clearly to my mind there is no reason why he should hesi
fi tate to do so. As Lieutenant Gover nor he will be the presiding officer of
JJ the Senate, but he will only have a vote in case of a tie. His political
82 position will be a passive rather than an active one, and I do not think
jjtf that he will find any one to criticise if he fills both places.
JJ "To any one who may be Inclined to do so I will say that whether the
tj president of the Miners' Association or not, in the appointment of his
S2 committees and in his other legislative duties he will be the same Jacob
â¢2 Neff, doing no wrong because he knows none, swayed by no influences,
?2 because he is stronger than any influence. As our president his legislative
?i acts, what few will devolve, upon him, will show no bias. But leaving
?$ these things aside, he is the unanimous choice of every man among us.
?i We know him as he is, and we are going to compel him to submit to our
?S wishes in this matter, not caring what arguments he may bring to bear.
82 I think I can safely say that Mr. Neff is, again, our next president."
g2 Mr. Neff doesn't know just exactly where he does stand. All day yes
82 terday he was a blushing target for all sorts of bouquets, rhetorical and
?2 hothouse, in bunches and singly, and late in the afternoon he got wind of
?2 the scheme to railroad him into the president's chair, and the combina
82 tion of honors was a little too many. When asked last evening what an
82 swer he would give to his friends to-day, Mr. Neff said:
J2 "Really, I have not quite figured out my position yet. The boys have
82 told me that they want me to be president again, but I've said I wouldn't,
?j and there are two candidates In the field already, and then my political
fi position. No, I don't know just what I can do, but if the boys go ahead
fi as they say they are going to I don't see what else I can do than accept
fi and take the consequences."
fi Mr. Neff has practically accepted re-election, and "the boys" are
Ji thankful for it. Besides the love that they have for him, his election will
82 nip in the bud the dissension that has grown out of the contest between
ti Ralston and Sonntag for his seat, which, it was feared, might result in a
82 permanent division in the ranks. And that Is a condition that the associa
82 tion feels that it cannot afford at this critical period.

I hope that you â will succeed with your praise
worthy undertakings, that we will soon see a
miner in the Cabinet, and that Congress and the
Legislature will make the appropriations nec
essary to enable you to take the wealth .that
still remains in the mountains of California.
After the applause that was rendered
Mr. Phelan had subsided President Neff
announced the following names to consti
tute the committee on credentials:
Judge F. Adams, El Dorado, chairman; Hos
mer Jeffries, Alameda; E. C. Voorheis, Ami
dor; W. E. Duncan, Butte; J. A. Read, Cala
veras: George Dow, Chamber of Commerce,

Through Mr. Neff's selection every one
of the counties represented in the conven
tion had. a delegate i in the committee,
which i proceeded to the work that was be
fore it as soon as adjournment had been
taken to 2 o'clock p. m.
The afternoon session was opened with
the appointment of J. T. Young as ser
geant-at-arms and the announcement that
the committee on debris dams, etc., would
hold an Important meeting at 8 o'clock In
the evening at the Maple room of the
Palace Hotel. President Neff then called
for the report of the committee on cre
dentials and it was read by Secretary
Sonntag. It was as follows:
To the chairman, California Miners' Asso
ciation: Tour committee on credentials has
the honor to submit the ' following report:
We find a total of 670 delegates present or
represented by proxy, as follows: --
Alameda County, 20; Amador County, 54;
Butte County, 20; Calaveras County, 20: El Do
rado County. 36; Nevada County. 147; Kern
County, 2; Placer County, 62; San Francisco

! We recommend that | the delegates of each
county or organization represented In this
convention be authorized to cast the full vote
of all delegates such organization Is entitled
to, and the majority present control the vote
of absentees. F. ADAMS, chairman.
The I adoption of the resolution â¢ was
moved by Judge F. Adams of El Dorado,
chairman of the committee, but the ques
tion was objected to by Judge Bush of
Shasta, who took exception to the clause
providing for the voting of absent mem
bers. Judge Bush paid that if they had
not taken enough interest In the conven
tion to attend, it they should have] no
voice 'in i its deliberations. j Colonel iMe
Bride of San Juan Ridge, one of thei num
erous Nevada 1 County delegation, replied
to Judge Bush and said that! there were
many reasons why absentees had been
prevented from attending land that! all of
them were valid. Judge Adams said about
the same thing. Bush gracefully receded
from his position and the report wo?
adopted without dissent. â  . ' !
Secretary Sonntag then announced the
following committee on resolutions and a
motion was made and carried referring to
the committee all resolutions except those
of thanks that might engage the attention
of the convention:
J. M. Walling (chairman) Nevada: Charles
G. Tale. San Francisco: J. M. Fulweiler, Pla

Chairman Walling rounded up his com
mittee and notified them to meet with him
at the Palace Hotel at 7:30 o'clock last
evening, when they would consider any
resolutions that were intended for the
consideration of the association. [
President Neff set the house to applaud
ing again with the announcement that
some time during to-day Governor Budd
would drop In to shake hands with I his
mining friends and would also be: guilty
of a short address, and before the racket
had subsided Mr. Neff started In :on ! his
seventh annual farewell address, i which,
by the way.bids fair to be no more a fare
well than was any of the six others. Mr.
Neff said In part: i .'j [m

LAVIGNE IS READY FOR ACTION.
HIXXING IIN A CLINCH.
I FEEL as fine as silk," was the an
swer George Lavigne made yester
day to a Call representative at his
training station at Blanken's Six-mile
House.
The "kid," as he is. called by his at
tendants, is certainly looking as
bright as a star and as hard as a nail.
If appearance is an indicator George
Lavigne can safely be booked as be
ing in fit trim to fight for any man's
coin.
In the course of conversation the lad
from Saginaw said that he had fully
made up his mind that his prospect
ive opponent, Tom Tracey, he expects
to find an artful dodger and a man
who is hard to corner.
"Although I will be handicapped In
weight probably seven or eight
pounds," Lavigne continued, "I never
theless expect by persistent effort to
corner my man at some stage of the
game, and once I get him in a tight
place I think there will be something
doing."
LavlgnÂ© does not look for a short
may bÂ« received In the, same spirit they are
offered.
"What have we accomplished thus far In our
work? What results have come from our
efforts?
"We have, in the first place, created a
favorable sentiment toward the mining lnr
dustry. We have to a great extent restored
amity between miners and farmers. We must
still further impress the farmers that their
cause Is our cause and that we want their
active co-operation with us. We have estab
lished the fact that the restoration of mining,
the protection of agricultural lands and the
improvement of our rivers is a Government
matter, and that If we all continue to work as
a unit we will secure the aid necessary to
accomplish the purpose. We have already been
Instrumental In startine quite a number of
mines that had lain idle for years, and with

progress, while slow, has been sure, and we
were never in better condition to accomplish
our purpose than at present. We have secured
recognition from both State and nation In the
way of appropriations, and we confidently ex
pect still further aid and encouragement in the
future. I have the assurance from Congress
men that a satisfactory mineral land bill will
be passed during the coming session. But we
must not rest upon our oars. The good work
must be continued. While much has been done,
more remains to be done. We must strengthen
our organisation. We must reach out, enlarge
our scope and broaden our influence.
"The business men of San Francisco have
been liberal contributors, both In money and In
fluence, to the association â taking the view that

what benefits one section benefits the whole
State. Without their generous assistance and
encouragement our labors would have been far
less successful.
"As I have said before, the officer* of the
fight. In fact, he expects the contest
to run on pretty well to the finish of
the twenty rounds, as Tracey Is said to
be a natural born racer, "who never
grows weary of carpet dancing."
Lavigne defeated Wolcott in this city
at 132^4 pounds on October 29, 1897.
O'Rourke, who was behind the col
ored Hercules, threw up the sponge at
the end of the twelfth round. Since
that time Lavigne boxed two draws
of twenty rounds eachâ one with Jack
Daly and one with Frank Erni. He is
now being handled by his brother Billy,
"Biddy" Bishop and Teddy Alexander,
and although he gave his present
weight as being 134 pounds he certain
ly looks as If he can tip the beam at
138 pounds. The "kid" punched the
bag yesterday in the presence of sev
eral Interested spectators and the di
rectors of the National Club. Judg
ing from the way he sent the oval
smashing against the celling of the
bag-punching apparatus it is safe to
say that Pugilist Lavigne has lost
none of his old-time strength and dash
association have never asked for or received
a dollar for their services, and I am of the
opinion that this is a time when we can profit
ably deviate from the course hitherto pur
sued. The office of president should be an
honorary office. The secretaryship should have
a liberal salary attached to It."
With a strong argument for the exten
sion of the membership of the association
Mr. Neff closed his speech and for five
minutes business was at a standstill,
waiting for the applause that was ac
corded him to cease.
It finally subsided and a resolution of
thanks to Jeff E. Doolittle was intro
duced and carried unanimously. Mr. Doo
little presented to the association as
handsome a banner as ever graced a con
vention hall and It was to show the asso
ciation's gratitude that the resolution was
introduced.
The Chamber of Commerce sent in a
little letter inviting the association to
put up $250 toward the expense of send
ing Hugh Craig to Washington to work
for the passage of a Nicaragua canal bill.
The letter was hastily referred to the
committee on finance.
Charles G. Yale of the San Francisco
delegation then took the platform and
read a resolution recognizing the bravery
of youn" Felix Chappelet, superintendent
of the Kureka drift mine, on the Forest
Hill divide. The story of Chappelet s
bravery reads like a tale from the ' boys
and girls' page" and is best told in the
resolution itself. It is as follows:
Whereas, At the time of the recent disastrous
fire in the compressor house at the mouth or
the tunnel of the Eureka drift mine on the
Forest Hill divide. Placer County, upon finding
that the buildings would be destroyed, Felix
Chappelet Jr., superintendent of the mlne^
knowing that four men were in what mlgrht cms
a dangerous position, ran for 2500 feet through
the tunnel and up a 300-foot upraise, to where
the men were at work, bringing them out
through the smoke and flame in safety; be it
Resolved, That our fellow member, Felix
Chappelet Sr., . already noted as among our
most skillful drift miners, be congratulated
upon having a son who is a "chip of the old
block," and though only a young man of M.
possessing the bravery to do a noble action
with self-sacrifice and promptness.
Resolved, That the miners of California, In
convention assembled, recognize the heroism of
this young native ton of California, and of a
distinguished sire, and desire to congratulate
him upon so bravely doing his duty to the men
under his charge.
Three hearty cheers went up when Mr.
Yale finished with his reading and a mo
tion to pass the resolution by a standing
vote was responded to by every man in.
the hall.
"Gentlemen, I must congratulate you
upon having done a righteous act," said
Mr. Neff. "Such bravery as this is rare,
and it is an honor to us to take recogni
tion of it."
The president then called for reports,
and A. H. Ricketts, chairman of the Min
eral Lands Committee, submitted a vol
uminous document dealing with the prog
ress of mineral developments through the
ages. He was followed by an enthusiastic
committee from the Nevada County dele
gation, which appeared on the stage head
ed by B. N. Shoecroft, who was decked
out like a spring graduate, with a huge
bunch of carnations. It developed that
the carnations were Intended as a token
of the love and esteem In which Nevada
County holds President Neff, and the
blushing official acknowledged the gift in
neatly turned phrase.
Professor S. B. Christy, who went to
Salt Lake as a delegate to the National
mining Convention, then handed in his
report, as did Tlrey L. Ford, who has had
charge of all matters requiring national
legislation.
After making the election of officers the
special order for this afternoon at 2:30 the
convention adjourned until 10 o'clock this
morning.

gainsaid, however, that the contest
will prove to be one of the most in
teresting affairs of its kind that the
sporting public has witnessed in
many moons, as the boxers are classed
as being professors of the manly art.
At Crowley's pool rooms and Cor
bett's much Interest is taken in the
contest, and it is expected that betting
will be very lively before the men step-*
into the ring.

Says the Filipinos _jre Industrious

Piety by Filling the
Churches.
Father Francis B. Doherty, the well
known Paulist father of this city, who
accompanied General Merrltt to Manila,
arrived here on the Coptic yesterday,
having been ordered home on account of
physical weakness brought about by

the intelligent and wealthy elements seek
