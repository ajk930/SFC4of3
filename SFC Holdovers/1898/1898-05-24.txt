VOLUME LXXXIIT.â NO. 175.
Off to join Dewey
MELLOW its & matin bell, vet
sweet as an Alpine horn, the
voice of a silver-throated bu
gle at dawn awoke the sleep-
ing soldiers of the Presidio yes
terday morning. The clear and pene
trating notes of the reveille announced
that it was time to shake sleep from
soldiers' eyelids and prepare for the
voyage to Manila.
And so the patriotic bugler, standing
erect and looking- toward the purpling
east at break of day, wafted to the
ears of the dreaming soldiers of the
First Regiment of California volun
teers the message that called them to
go forth and flg.it for the flag of their
native land.
Again the bu{,le winds. The day Is
breaking. The soldiers stir and pre
pare to march from the tented field, to
go forth from the quiet, woody places
of the picturesque Presidio to fight for
the principles of honor and Justice an
nounced by the American Government.
So, too, the city stirs, for the cause of
her soldier boys is her cause, the bat
tles of the country are hers. Th^re is a
muffled sound of feet. Flags that
drooped listlessly the livelong night
along their halyards, now undulate
proudly in the morning breeze. A pur
ple mist, giving promise of a perfect
day, hangs o'er sea and land, bathing
spires and domes in a flood of golden
glory.
It is embarkation day, the climax of
weary days of waiting. Inspiring
strains of music echo through the
streets, while colors dip and rise as sol
diers pass.- The city is a rose-wilder
ness of color, the benign sky with blue
and golden tints brooding over all.
San Francisco gave the departing pa
triots from her civilian ranks a heart
r>!t and eloquent farewell that can
never be forgotten. Fmm the moment
that her sons in blue marched from the
parade grounds to the glorious music
of old war tunes until they reached the
monster ship that is to carry them to
the support of the immortal Deivey
they were greeted with re-echoing
cheers from thousands of loyal men,
women and children.
And as they marched proudly
through the city's crowded streets the
national colors waved from the tops of
lofty domes and towers, and the scene
was one of unexampled majesty and
magnificence. Mingled with the cheers
of the multitude were the triumphant
notes of bands, while here and there, in
quiet places, the tears of sorrow trick
led down the furrowed cheeks of age.
Mothers and grandmothers bade fare
well to their darlings, conscious that
the pride and support of many a fam
ily would probably make his bed with
the heroic dead who have battled for
the rights of man since first the light of
freedom dawned.
Long before the day began homes
and business houses were deserted.
People stood for hours waving flags
and cheering as the soldiers passed.
There were flags in the hands of prat
tling babes who understood only the
meaning of bright colors, and flags in
the hands of veterans of historic fields,
while women : t the gates of cottages
and at the windows of splendid man
sions cheered and cried as they remem
bered the gloomy days when dear ones
fell where storms of leaden hail mowed
down heroes of the long ago.
The escort of signal corps preceded
the First Infantry. The columns pre
sented a picturesque sight as they
formed in marching order. The good
bys had been said to mothers, sisters,
sweethearts and wives, comrades of the
camp ground and lingering friends.
Suddenly the civilian soldiers marched
in quickstep to their places, heedless of
everything save the commands of offi
cers.
The music of the bands -~as tenderly
sweet, throbbing with patriotic im
pulses and memories of the battles of
the herolo past. From the Presidio to
the dock the scene was one never to be
forgotten, either by the soldiers who
went forth to offer up their lives for
the flagr they loved, or by the countless
throng that cheered them as they
passed.
The march down Van Ness avenue
was like the historic procession of Ro
man legions going forth among strange
peoples, carrying the banners of Caesar
to lands of warring barbarians. From
Lombard street down to the turn on
Golden Gate avenue the march was a
continuous line of cheering and pa
thetic farewells. Jaded with their
heavy burdens some of the soldiers
faltered on the way and all were weary
at the journey's end.
On Market street the crowd waa such
as the city has seldom seen. Along the
entire line of gleaming steel and pa
triotic blue there wore heartfelt cheers
and sorrowful farewells. And when
the Peking steamed into thestream with
her cargo of human freight there was
a volume of cheers from thousands of
throats, while flags and handkerchiefs
waved good-bys until the last glimpse
of the faces of the soldiers was taken
by their lonely friends along the shore.
LEIGH H. IRVINE.
FOLDED THEIR TENTS
IN THE EARLY DAWN
The First California Volunteers
Break Camp and Start to
Dewey's Aid.
They have gone.
Amid the tears, cheers and prayers
of their mothers*, fathers, sisters,
wives and sweethearts, the soldiers of
San Francisco have marched away to
meet the enemy upon the field of honor.
It was 4 o'clock yesterday morning
when the first notes of the Reveille
The San Francisco Call
pounding through the camp awoke the
men. from what may be for years their
last sleep upon the Presidio reserva
tion, and, indeed, many were awakened
from their last slumber on American
Foil, for in the decrees of fate it cannot
be that of the brave band that marched
away yesterday all will return. Hard
ly had the notes of the trumpet died
upon the early morning air before the
camp took on an aspect of life and an
imation. Around headquarters the of
ficers were busy getting their personal
efforts packed, while in the company
streets the soldiers were engaged in
getting their haversacks packed, their
blankets rolled up and their canteens
filled with water. This was the work
of but a few moments and then the
loading of the camp equipage on large
drays was begun and completed in a
twinkling.
At 5:30 the call for breakfast was
sounded and the men and officers alike
fell to with a hearty zest. Despite the
attempted gayety of all, there was a
general depression that made itself felt
from the colonel down, and the meal
whs not a jolly one. There was no
disguising the fact that all seemed to
realize the great and impending grav
ity of the task that they had under
taken, but there was no lagging, no
desire to turn back; only the men man
ifested, as all brave men do, who un
dertake to defend their flap, the ap
preciation of the uncertainty of fate.
By 6 o'clock a large crowd had gath
ered to see the regiment start, and
when 6:35 o'clock the general call for
striking camp sounded and the whitÂ«
tents fell, the crowd cheered, while
from the camps of the Seventh ana
| Sixth regiments came back a counter
! wave of honest lung power that at
! tested the good will and wishes of the
| less fortunate soldiers, who live In the
i daily hope that their summons to the
I front may come without delay. Com
pany E won the $5 prize for being the
first company to fold up their tents.
It was exactly 10 minutes after 7
when Colo-nel Smith gave the order to
| his majors to form their battalions,
and a few minutes later he emerged
| from his tent and handed to the color
| sergeant of Company B the stand of
! colors that were presented to the regi
| ment by the Chamber of Commerce.
! This was the siernal for the regiment
i to begin its march, and the First, un
| der Majc-r Boxton, filed from the camp
! for regimental formation. Then fol
i lowed the Second, under Major Sime,
while Major Tilden closed in upon the
loft with the Third. As soon as the
formation had been completed, Colonel
Smith gave the order to march, and the
soldiers, with measured tread and
Bteady swing, passed out of the gate
of the Presidio, at exactly 20 minutes to
8. The crowd cheered, hats were
thrown in the air and the women
waved their handkerchiefs and small
flags, while as a last word of parting
and a token of comradeship, th^re
came from the soldiers that were left
behind three rousing cheers that made
the welkin ring.
Along Lombard street the coming of
the regiment was announced by the
blasts from many whistles, while the
crowd that lined the sides of the streets
cheered and cheered, until the vast
wave of human voices, like a sea of
mighty pound, rolled along in advance
of the tramping column. Several halts
were made to rest the men, who were
in heavy marching order. At every
stop some one would rush from the
crowd to clasp the hand of a soidier
SAN FRANCISCO, TUESDAY, MAY 24, 1898.
for a parting word, while more than I
one mother, with tears streaming from
her eyes, seized the opportunity to
kiss her son good-by. Many citizens
kept on foot with the troops along the
line of march.
Stationed at the corner of Lombard
street and Van Ness avenue were one
hundred picked policemen to act as
escort to the vanguard. The policemen
were divided into eight platoons, whose
movements were directed by Captain
Fnillane and Lieutenant Anderson and
Sergeants Donovan, Shay, Coogan,
Harper and Baldwin.
It was nearly 8 o'clock when the Cali
fornia volunteers, 1300 strong, turned
from Lombard street Into Van Ness
avenue, with Colonel Smith and his
staff riding at the head of the long
column. Occasionally Colonel Smith
turned in his saddle to view the regi
ment and it was evident to every ob
server that he felt proud of his corn-
mand, and well he might, composed as i
It is of the best youth and young man- j
hood of the Golden State. The volun- j
teers marched with a soldierly tread.
The men kept step to the soul-stirring
muiio of the fife and drum corps, i
â which upon entering Van Ness avenue
struck up the favorite tune of the
North, "Yankee Doodle," and followed
it with "Dixie," the pet of the South,
thus indicating a union of hearts and
hands in one common cause.
Chief of Police Lees now swung his
men into line at the head of the column,
which proceeded slowly along the ave
nue.
By this time the broad thoroughfare
was lined with people, who were early
astir to witness a military event long
to be remembered in the annals of San
Francisco and California, The side
walks, the porches, the windows and
the house tops were crowded with spec
tators and there was continuous cheer-
-
! ing, waving of flags and banners and
j handkerchiefs and the throwing and
presentation of bouquets.
Between Pacific and Jackson streets
was stationed the naval militia, com-
LjDoaed of seventy-five men. in charge of ..
Ensign T. S. Harlow, under orders from
Major General Dickinson, to escort
the First Regiment to he place
of embarkation. Next was the Signal
Corps, consisting of twenty-five mount
ed men, with Lieutenant Hughes in
command; and then came a troop of
twenty-five National Guard cavalry
men under Captain Burnett. These two
mounted bodies formed a squadron, in
command of Captain Perkins of the
National Guard. The naval militia
men and the cavalry opened ranks and
allowed the regiment to pass through,
the signal corps afterward going to
the front.
Between Clay and Washington
streets the regiment was reviewed by
the Governor's staff, consisting of Gen
eral Barrett. Major General Dickinson
and staff. Brigadier General Warfield
and staff, Captain Turner, Lieutenant
W. F. Burke and Lieutenant Comman
der Nerny and Surgeon F. "W. Harris of
the naval militia. All these reviewing
officers, occupying carriages, brought
up the rear of the column, taking a
front position later on.
As the volunteers swung into Golden
Gate avenue the crowd became denser
and more demonstrative.
Market street was reached at about
9:30, and that thoroughfare was found
packed with a mass of eager and patri
otic humanity. It was with considera
ble difficulty that the procession forced
a passage way. Vehicles of all descrip
tions, loaded with men, women and
children, here and there almost entirely
blocked the street. Even the tops
of the street cars, which had
been stopped, were crowded with men
and boys. Telegraph and tele
phone poles were alive with boys, and
not a place where it was possible to ob
tain a view was vacant. Never has
there been in the history of San Fran
cisco such an outpouring of people, nor
has there ever been more enthusiasm
and patriotism shown.
There was an immense jam in the vi
cinity of The Call building, where the
regiments turned down Third street,
and on toward the steamer. Although
the column had been narrowed to fours
it was obliged to push and squeeze
through the surging mass.
Amid all the demonstrations of en
thusiasm and apparent rejoicings â
more characteristic of a galfe. day than
of the initial steps of an earnest and
dangerous mission â there were many
touching and pathetic scenes, indica
tive of a strong undercurrent of tender ;
feeling from depressed hearts. There !
was no lark "f woman's tears â the tears !
of mother, wife, daughter, sister and j
sweetheart. Before the dock was ;
reached there was a host in that vast j
jostling crowd who realized that per
haps the last fond embrace, the last
sweet kiss, the final parting had come.
Here and there a devoted woman had
pressed herself into the ranks to walk
along with the man she loved, holding
him by his hand and saying the fare
well words, every now and then wiping
away the tears from her bedimmed
eyes. There were scenes of family sep
arations that brought the heart of
every man into his throat.
Denser and more congested even than
the gathering at Third and Market
streets was the crowd at the foot of
Bryant street, the point^of embarka
tion. In reaching the gate of the Pa
cific Mail Steamship Company's dock
the soldiers had to force their way
through a very narrow path, first form
ing two abreast and finally going in
single file. As each company marched
by it was greeted with rousing chrers
and inspiriting music Finally, at about
11 o'clock, they had all passed into the
dock and were soon on board the
steamer City of Peking, thus closing
the first act in the realistic drama of
war, in which they are now engaged.
ON THE TRANSPORT
READY FOR SEA
Last Farewells Spoken as the Men
Marched Up the GanÃ Plank.
He was a handsome little fellow of
perhaps four years, perched high on a
pile of baggage on the gloomy old Mail
dock, and eagerly he scanned the faces
lined up along the rail of the big troop
ship, quite oblivious of his mamma and
sister who stood by his side, or the clat
ter and hubbub on the dock behind
him.
"Papa, papa, oh, papa," piped h'.3
shrill little treble, as the one he sought
appeared in an officer's uniform. The
soldier did not hear, and again the
childish voice was raised. This time
It reached the eara it was intended for
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
and the man scanned the throngs tnto
til his eye fell on the little group.
"Papa, come down here. I jus' wart*
to say good-by again."
"Papa can't come," answered the
bearded officer, followed by a sharp
command to one of his men standing
close by. sharper than the occasion
called for, or the officer usually speaka
to his subordinates. There was a set,
stern expression on his face, far dif
ferent from his ordinarily kindly gaze
while his eyes were turned resolutely
from the child who begged for one more
good-by.
"Please, papa, come down here Jus' a
little minute; only long enough for me
to kiss you once. Won't you coma,
papa?"
"Hush, darling; papa Is busy and
can't come to us now." The mother's
hand nervously patted the little form,
while papa gave one wistful glance at
the trio on the dock, then turned sharp
ly on his heol and vanished.
"Less go home, mamma; papa ain't
going to say good-by to us again." Tha
great blue eyes were blinking furious
ly, but the tears would not be held en
tirely in check, and the tiny frame
quivered as the leaden-hearted mother!
helped him down from his perch, but
the sobs were choked down.
"Oh, dear, it does seem hard not t<J
kiss papa again, doesry't it, mamma?"
This time the girl spoke and as sha
did her eyes wandered lovingly to tha
spot where last the soldier stood.
There was no answerâ none was net
cessary â and those of the little family
who were left behind pushed through,
the crowd and disappeared.
The bands had hushed their martial
strains, the cheering multitudes were
left far behind and instead of the blaro
and the bustle and the roar, there was
naught but the Immense cavernous shed
and the seemingly endless line of blue
bloused men marching over the side ot
the ship and vanishing Into her greaÂ«
hold. Buoyed by the acclaims of tha
patriots who were left behind, tha
troops bore themselves proudly, as do
all men who march beneath the stars
and stripes, but now that it was all
over, the tension was relaxed, fatigue
weighted their footsteps and they
longed for the seclusion of their cramp
ed and comfortless quarters on tha
ship.
And while they waited on the deckâ *
it was hours before the last of then*
dragged himself up the gangplankâ â¢
their greatest trial was undergone, tha
final words of parting to those they
held most dear, were spoken. Alonff
the streets they had received the cheers
of acquaintances and friends. Now
mothers, wives, sisters and even dearer
ones crowded upon them, not witft
flushed and excited faces, but with,
heavy eyes and trembling voices that
broke to the faintest whisper at tha
last.
It was 9:30 o'clock when the regi
ment marched onto the dock; it was
nearly lour hours later when thrÂ»
guards at the entrance were withdrawn
and joined their comrades. It was the
intention to keep the wharf absolutely
clear of people, but long before the sol
diers arrived relatives and friends
stormed the entrance so persistently
that the guard, the police and tha
gatekeepers had not the heart to hold
thrm longer nt bay and so the wholo
length of tho dock was quickly filled.
The band was still playing when the
regiment marched down, but as famil
iar voices called the musicians by name
false notes marred the melody and fin
ally the drums alone tapped the ca
dence. "When the men halted with the
first company almost at the font of tha
gangplank onlookers and soldiers cast
aside all care for discipline and align
ment and all that, thinking only of
those about to invade a hostile coun
try and those who remained at home.
Partly hidden behind a pile of flour, ft
sweet-faced girl clung to a strapping
corporal, with one breath begging him
not to go, and with the next whisperings
to him how proud she was of her sol
dier husband.
Down the line a short distance a
stately, snowy-haired woman folded
her dust-covered and begrimed boy to
her breast and crooned the mother talk
just as she did when first she held him
in her arms.
Close beside her stood another moth
er, whose son marched with the other.
Her dress was in violent contrast to
that of her neighbor, and her form was
bent with age and sorrow, but hep
wrinkled face glowed with the holy
mother-love. She essayed to speak
words of endearment, but her voice
failed, and burying her faco in the
army blue she gave way to her grief.
Rut not for long. With a great effort
she regained her composure, and noting
the distress on the young giant's face,
sought to cheer him.
The men began to march on board,
dear ones clinging to them as they
passed down the narrow lane, only
loosing their grasp when the sentry at
the gang plank forcibly prevented them
from continuing onto the deck of tha
ship. If the last farewell that greeted
the women was harshly spoken they
did not mind, for the loved ones were
soldiers and could not be expected to)
show any emotion before so many.
Now and then a knot of soldiers-^
young dare-devils with a fine contempt
for all things bordering on the senti
mental, burst Into song, but somehow
even their voices failed to have the ring
they did the day before in camp.
Company X neared the gang planlc
and halted. A fashionobly dressed
young fellow called out to a squad of
the soldiers: "Good-by. fellows; don't
forget the gang at Palo Alto." The
"fellows" replied with the short, sharp
bark that has rung out so often on tha
gridiron when the crimson of Stanford
i scored, a touchdown, and everybody;2
knew the cheerers comprised the con
tribution of the famous collega to the
defense of the flag 1 .
At last it was all over. As fast as the
men marched on board they were hur
ried below, and comparatively few of
them managed to get back on deck
again until after the Peking had
dropped into the stream off Mission
Rock.
But amid the leave-takings and the
preparations for departure, one little
band of women escaped notice, but
their presence was recalled with the
deepest gratitude by those on board af
ter the ship left the dock. Mrs. T. H.
Powers and a corps of assistants from
the Red Cross Society went down
aboard the steamer long before the
troops arrived, accompanied by a wa
gon heaped with provisions. Camp
chests and ammunition cases were ar
â â <\ en deck in long rows, in lieu of
tables, and on these was spread the re
past for officers and men. Since its or
ganization the Red CrcFs has per
formed many noble deeds, but none
more praiseworthy than this. The men
breakfasted at 4:30 a. m., and had noth
ing to eat until after tho ship < apt
rff her lines. They would have fasted
much longer had it not been for the
thoughtfulness of these Samaritans,
for the army rations were piled on
board in the greatest confusion, and
everything was topay-turvy.
Blessed be the name of the Red Cross
fty and thrice blessed be its mem
bers. J. J. COREY.
HONOR TO THE
CALIFORNIA TROOPS.
First United States Soldiers to
Leave the Continent to Up
hold the Flag.
What is to-day regarded as an event
in San Francisco may in the years to
come be recorded In the history of the
world as one of the events of the cen
tury. The First California Regiment of
Volunteers that marched from the Pre
sidio to embark for the Philippines on
the City of Peking r.ay possess the fu
ture distinction of being the lirst regi
ment of r Tnited States soldiers to leave
the American continent to uphold the
flag of this country on a battle field in
another hemisphere. Â»
It is true that American soldiers
faced the British regulars on Canadian
soil and it is likewise true that a small
but gallant army of Americans planted
our starry banner on the citadels of
Mexico, but this is the nrst record of
land forces leaving the American con
tinent to engage an enemy in conflict.
It is known that General Merritt of
the United States army has made an
earnest request that as many regular
troops as the Government can spare
from other iields may be added to the
expedition to the Philippines. He is an
army officer of experience in many cele
brated campaings and is fully conscious
of the fact that however zealous and
brave the volunteers may be the habits
of obedience derived from long training
which the regular troops possess are
sure to count for much in a campaign
of marching and fighting.
The American volunteers made
a record for bravery, endurance and
discipline under withering h're at Buena
Vista, Vicksburg, Chickamauga and
Gettysburg that is not surpassed in the
annuls of war, but men familiar with
the organization of new troops know
that time is required to bend the volun
teers Into shape, to eliminate the weak
and nerve the strong. It was the les
son in IS6I that the regiment which
went to the front 1000 strong after
months of toil, fatigue and exposure
entered the first battle with less than
600 men.
The men comprising the First Regi
ment of California Volunteers are not
new recruits in the sense that this term
is used when applied to the militia.
They have been trained in the armory
ard have had some experience in camp.
They know how to handle their guns
and look after themselves in ordinary
routine of service. Their leader. Colonel
James F. Smith, is alert, gallant and
ambitious. He will lead wherever his
men are directed to go. Time may
elapse before the regiment meets th't
enemy. Disease and exposure may thin
the ranks of the command, but the
American spirit of the troops will not
be daunted by the losses.
Some regiment in the Army of the
Philippine may acquire special dis
tinction in the Orient and be permitted
by General Merritt to inscribe on its
colors words significant of a great vic
tory. In the fortunes of war this honor
may be reserved for the First Regiment
of California Volunteers.

to the water front and go aboard the
steamers City uf Sydney and Austra
lia. This done the first expeditionary
'orce for the support of Admiral Dewey
kvill set sail from this port bound Cor
Manila. The headquarters and two
battalions of the Second Oregon Regi
uent will ship on the Australia, which
:iu\v lies at pier 7, Oceanic Steamship
Company's docks, and the headquar
:ers and a battalion of the Fourteenth
[nfantry, with the detachment from,
the heavy artillery, will ship on the
City of Sydney, which vessel is at the
Pacific Mail Company's wharf. The line
jf march will be down Lombard to Van
Ness, thence to Golden Gate avenue
and down to Market over the same
route as was taken by the First Regi
ment yesterday, with the exception that
the two battalions of the Oregon regi
ment that are to go on the Australia
will continue down Market from Third
street.
Companies A and G, of the Four
teenth Infantry, that were ordered here
from Alaska, arrived at the Presidio
yesterday. The former company is
commanded by Captain F. F. Eastman
and the latter by Captain L. A. Matile.
The two companies are about a hun
dred men strong between them. Cap
tain Murphy will be in command of
the battalion, which will consist of
Companies A, C, D, E and F. Major
Robe will remain here with Company
G for the purpose of recruiting the
two other companies to complete the
regiment's complement as called for by
Congress. Lieutenant Huntt, the re
cruiting officer, will also remain. The
Fourteenth ie completely equipped in
every way, as is the Second Oregon
Regiment. The Heavy Artillery may
not be in parade, as Captain Geary ex
perts to take them down upon the
street cars. A purse of $250 was raised
in the city for the benefit of this de
tachment, and Major Rice said yester
day that the men would spend some of

Reveille will be sounded in the camp
of the Fourteenth and the Second Ore- |
gon at 4 o'clock this morning, so that
camp may be struck and the march
commenced promptly at 6:30 o'clock. !
Captain Mallory of General Otis' staff
held an inspection of the Oregon regi- ;
ment yesterday afternoon and found it
in excellent shape. The regiment was
in heavy marching order. Colonel
Summers reports the health of his
command to be excellent, although at
the Regimental Hospital Captain Rob
lee said yesterday afternoon that five
new cases of measles were in the regi
ment yesterday morning, and that they
had been sent to Black Point. ThesÂ«
men, of course, will have to be left be
hind, but *iev will no doubt be sent to
join their commands when the Seventh
goes. The general health of the other
regiments now encamped at the Pre
sidio is good with no new serious cases
reported.
ON THE WATER jFRONT.
The Monterey May Not Go to
Manilla After All.
By to-night or to-morrow morning at
the latest the harbor will be minus three
steamers and 3000 troops or more will be
on their way to Manila. Yesterday after
noon the City of Peking was taken out
into the stream by the tug Millen Grif
fith and anchored midway between the
Mail dock and Mission Rock. Half an
hour later a stern-wheel steamer was
on one side of her and a barge on the
other discharging ammunition into the
troop-ship. The work of handling the
shut and shell was done very carefully,
and it will probably be some time this
afternoon before the 400 tons that the
vessel is to take away is all aboard.
When the soldier boys first got aboard
the Peking, they paid little attention to
their surroundings, as all their time was
taken up in bidding good-by to their
friends on the wharf. When they got out
in the stream, however, they got a chance
to look at the accommodations provided
for them, and as v result the man who
d( signed the bunks was called every
name in the calendar. Those of the sol
di, rs who had seen the accommodations
provided on the Australia were the loud
est in their condemnation of the quarters
provided on the Peking. From the ex
pressions of opinion it would appear as
if there would be considerable grumbling
before the vessel^reaehod Manila.
BREAKING THE PRESIDIO CAMP.
Busy Scene Presented When the First Regiment
Left for Manila.
On the Australia the men's quarters
have all been provided with patent bunks.
Tiny are the invention of a Sun Fran
cisco boy, Thomas R. Turner, port stew
ard of the Pacific Coast Steamship Com
pany, and :tre a splendid thing for econ
omizing space ami providing comfort for
travelers, .tint- of the direct results of
using the patent bunks on the Australia
is that, that vessel, although much small
er than the Peking, is enabled to accom
modate almost us many soldiers as the
larger vessel. The bunks have metal
frames in which are set woven mat
tresses. They are placed in tiers of three
during the night and during the day
time the blankets can be rolled up, the
bunks lowered and formed into a settee.
These settees face the aisles, and when
dinner time comes tables, which are part
of the paraphernalia, are lowered from
the ceiling, and fitting in between the two
rows of settees turns the sleeping room
into a dining room. The number of tables
correspond with the setters, so that if
the men want to play cards or write let
ters they can lower and raise the differ
ent sections at will. The Iroquois (ex-
Feerlc-ss). Active and Vigilant, recently
purchesed by the Government from the
Spreckels Tow-boat Company, have all
been fitted with these bunks, and they
will also be placed in the Zealandia when

their passengers, the Klondike si earners
Roanoke, Cottage City, City of Puebla, |
Walla Walla, I'matilla and Senator have

the Government has ordered 2000 '<f them

The band of the Thirteenth Minnesota j
Regiment was given an impromptu outing i
on the bay yesterday. They were down i
on the water front to see their comrades j
away on the City of Peking, when they
ran across Henry Peterson and George
Dryden, one of the State wharfingers.
Henry took the bandsmen all over the
training ship Marion and showed them
what the Naval Reserve expected to do
when they got into action. Then he placed
his launch Amy at their disposal for a
trip around the bay. They were first tak
en out to the Monterey and serenaded
Rear Admiral Milier and the officer?.
Then the launch was steamed around the
Rush and the other revenue cutters,
while the bandsmen kept up strain after
strain of martial music. They then went
A CHANCE TO SEE

over to the Mail dock and as the launch
left that point to go to the Peking the
bandsmen played "The Girl I Left Be
hind Me." For nearly half an hour the
launch steamed round and round the Pe
king, while the band played "The Star
spangled Banner," "Yankee Doodle,"
Marching Through Georgia" and all the
other patriotic airs, winding up again as
the launch steamed away with "The Girl
I Left Behind Me."
The Monterey did not go up to the navy
yard yesterday morning, and it now seems
to be doubtful whether she will go to Ma
nila or not. Yesterday an urgent dis
patch arrived for Rear Admiral Miller,
and as the defense steamer's launch was
not in at the time the Marion's was
pressed into pen-ice and the message was
sent out to the admiral. When it was de
ciphered it leaked out that all prepara
tions for departure were to be stopped in
the meantime.
The Corwin's launch ran amuck yester
day. The engine worked in a very erratic
manner all morning, and in the afternoon
when the boat was making a landing at
the Folsom street steps the engine stuck
on the center, and before the difficulty
could be overcome the launch crashed in
to one of Peterson's whitehalls, cutting
it in two. The commander of Uncle
Sam's warship has promised to make
good the loss of the boat.

delay in getting off to Manila. The ma

They expected that the transport ships
would be ready to receive them, and that
they would get away with the first de

ported around camp yesterday that there
was but little chance of any of the regi
ments getting off inside of the next two
weeks. The necessary equipments have
not arrived.
The men are all well pleased with their
camping ground. The greatest difficulty
they have to overcome is keeping their
rifles clean, for it becomes quite windy
in the afternoon, and the dust and sand
are sent flying over everything.
The officers and men are in good health
and spirits, and only a few of them are
complaining of cokls. One of the men in
the Kansas regiment was found to be
suffering from measles yesterday, and
was at once removed to a hospital.

THE NATIONAL GUARD.

State Organization.
The subject of reorganizing the National
Guard of California brings forward some
interesting points. It now seems to be
conceded by military men who are famil
iar with the laws of the United States
and the statutes of California that tha
First, Seventh and Sixth regiments, which
were recently mustered into the service of
the United States, are still organizations
of the National Guard. They have not
been disbanded or mustered out of ser
vice but under the law are performing
duty in fields beyond the limits of tho

provides: "That when the members of
any troop, battery, battalion or regiment
of the organized militia of any State shall
enlist in the volunteer army in a body,
as such company, troop, battery, battal
ion or regiment, the regimental, company,
troop, battery and battalion officers in
service with the militia organization thus
enlisting may be appointed by the Gov
ernors of the States and Teritories."
The act of Congress, approved April 26,
IS9B, holda: "That in the event of a call
by the President for either volunteers or
the militia of the country, the President
is authorized to accept the quota of troops
of the various States and Territories, as
organized under the laws of the States
and Territories."
The troops from California have been
accepted under tne laws of this State.
In effect the National Guard has been
called Into active service. It is reasoned,
therefore, that otiier organizations can
not be enlisted to take the places in the
Guard of the regiments which have gona

San Francisco, CaLFLOWERS, CHEERS
AND TEARS FOR
DEPARTING TROOPS
Blossoms Strew the Way of the
Gallant First as It Starts off
to the War.
Perhaps San Francisco is not easily
aroused to an out ward show of enthu
siasm. Bu} yesterday it was aroused,
not to clamor and tumult, but to the
deeper emotion which finds expression
in a farewell spoken brokenly, in the
tear which none tries to conceal. A
-wave of patriotic fervor swept the
community, thrilling every heart. The
boys of the First California were on
their way to war. People lined the
streets to pay them as they passed
the tribute of a flower, a hand-clasp,
a sincere "God bless you."
It was not my privilege to see the
boys leave camp, but only to watch
with the throng at Third and Market
streets. No idle curiosity had collect
ed that throng. I was proud to be
one of it and tc realize that in all the
thousands there was a single senti
ment â only the desire to honor the
soldiers, to let them know how they
are loved of the people from among
whom they go, and how the il ass
they bore held high the colors we all
revere.
Loyal and brave, they had an
swered the call of their country,
and eager to go whither need
m.ifrht he, to meet, across a dreary
waste of water, and under a tropic
run, a foreign and merciless foe. They
had not stopped to think of the danger,
the fla;T had been threatened; it was
enough. So yesterday, when these gal
lant young soldiers were marching
away, the citizens turned out to see
them, and saw them through misty
eyes.
Long before the time for the First to
appear the- corner at which they were
to turn from Market to Third was
crowded as it had never been before.
From every window faces were peer
ir.LT. and the waving stars and stripes
filled the air with radiance. There was
m of impatience save when the
teal's shcrwed inclination to force
ssage or some vandal driver
break into the press. Then
â  dily strength of the indignant
, hrervers intervened with a firmness
short of violence. There was a
i^rtion of women In the gath
ering, and this was to have been ex
pected. They gave color and charac
ter to the vast assemblage. The shad
o-.v of the Red Cross fell upon the
multitude. The noble workers who by
this emblem signify the devotion which
has wrought so much comfort, looked
from their headquarters, cheering and
weeping.
High above, at regular Intervals, a
cannon at the very top of the Spreck
els building- boomed. It told that the
boys had left camp, that they were
coming. There was a sound of
whistles from the water front. Now
and then there would be a round of
cheering. But It was not a noisy occa
sion. The emotion which held posses
sion of men and women was not one
which Impelled to shouting.
A stir passed over the thousands
standing there, a murmur as though
en oh spoke to his neighbor. Some one
had caught the note of the bugle or the
first faint tap of the distant drum.
Then was the tramp of many feet and
the police making valiant show came
in sight. The clatter of hoofs an
nounced the mounted eacort. Then
again the steady tramp, tramp, a rattle
of side arms, hats off and a round of
cheers; the boys of the First were near.
They came, buoyant as for a holiday,
erect and proud as beseemed heroes.
Their weapons were burnished, their
faces aglow with a tender light. ' Per-
haps In this demonstration there was
to them a revelation. They must have
been elated and happy, albeit leaving
behind all they loved, for they were In
the midst of friends. There was no
possibility of precise military order.
There Is nothing In the tactical manual

which permits a stranger to clasp the
hand of a man In the ranks. It is even
outside of rules for a gray-haired
mother to rush forward to kiss the
bonny son her country is taking from
her, and for her to kiss the other boys
r.r-ar him -must be reckoned a further
transgression. There is no official pro
vision for adding- flowers to the equip
ment of a soldier in heavy marching
order. Yet all these things were done
and none tried to prevent.
Boom! The cannon from Its dizzy
height had sent its salute again and a
wreath of smoke floated hazily off Into
the sky.
A woman marched by the side of her
husband. She bore his rifle, he carried
. their child In his strong arms and ever
and again he stooped over so that their
lips met. It was a picture to touch all,
; and it was one of many pictures. The
people seemed swayed by a strange
| dual impulse of mingled sadness and
joy. They were sorry to see the hoys
g:o, yet prloried in their going. They
â  were conscious of a desire to call them
I back, but a greater desire to cheer
them on. Even the women, sobbing in
the arms of brother, sweetheart or hus
; band, had no word of reproach, nor
tried to make harder the last hours
ashore. Through all their tears there
shone a pride that theirs had been the
men so quick to answer when the sum
mon." reached them.
Coming down Market street the
soldiers had marched in fours and with
the precision of veterans, but they
could do it no longer. The press be
came so great that it was with diffi
culty two kept abreast and progress
was made in single file. "When at any
moment a girl is likely to break into
the ranks, when countless thousands
are anxious to get so near as to deliver
a message face to face, when the tender
of a bouquet is an incident marking
almost every drum beat, confusion
arises. The drum of one company was
actually silenced for a space. The
drummer was captured by an army of
young women who kissed him till he
blushed rosy red and went on his way
: embarrassed but blissful, timing his
taps to his heart beats and giving a
! sample of double-quick time. And thus
i they went by, showered with good
wishes, laden with gifts, knowing they
went from a city which loved them
well.
There was one thought not given
: words, but it must have been in every
, mind. It must have been this thought
which cast a somber tinge over all the
\ glitter and made the sunshine less bril
liant, the shadow more pronounced.
Some in the companies going past so
blithely would never come back. They
knew the chance of battle when they
! accepted it. They were going forward
without feax and without regret, but
those who witnessed their going won

i Some soldiers perhaps had none near

them adieu, but the adieus were for
them. Patriotism is a heritage all
may share and it creates a blood bond.

THE TWENTIETH KANSAS.
An Unmanly Slur on a Noble
Regiment Resented.
Editor of The Call: In Sunday morn
ing's issue of thfÂ» Chronicle appeared an
article which was supposed to give the
readers of the paper some id^a of camp
life among the soldiers of the Bay Dls-
In commenting upon the condition of
the men, the reporter in his efforts to
make a long article padded it with slurs
on the Kansas boys, and it is in justice to
them that 1 desire through the columns
of your sheet to inform the misguided
public regarding our condition.
In the first place, the Twentieth Regi
ment from Kansas enjoys the distinction
of being the first regiment of volunteers
mustered into the service of the United
States Government. This fact alone ac
counts for the present dilapidated condi
tion of the men, and there is, I trust, no
one In San Francisco or anywhere else
who will place dress first and patriotism
second at the present time.
The Kansas Volunteers were mobilized
at the State capital. The men were told
to take nothing from their homes with
them as the Government would outfit
them' immediately, and not one in every
hundred took a change of clothing.
The regiment lay m camp at I opeka,
Kans for three weeks, and during that
time "it rained every day. The camp
ground was a sea of mud and the ground
such that ditching the tents was impos
sible Therefore a majority of the iolun
teers were forced to lie in damp straw.
After three weeks of mud and rain,
during which time the only suits of
clothing possessed by the men became
ractred and their shoes wore out, orders
were received to leave immediately for
San Francisco. We were told that out
fits would be issued upon our arrival
here and not one man grumbled when
the orders to move came, and what is
still more remarkable, not one man out
of a full regiment deserted.
While mi route here we were forced to
live five days on three days' travel ra
tions. The men were mostly quartered
in common day coaches, and Beveral
times coffee w;ir not Issued until three
<r four hours after meal time, still no
man grumbled. Nearly every man in the
regiment Is a son of a veteran. It will
be remembered t i . a t Kansas was popu
lated with veterans after the Civil War,
and the same stanch qualities which
Imbued the soldiers of 'Hi to win their
battles is inherent in thojr son?.
When we arrived within tho boundaries
of California our bungry stomachs were
filled with the best of edibles by patriotic
women along the way, and our hearts
made happy by presents of flowers. Our
reception in this State was a most hos
pitable one, and tho Kansas lads felt
that hero" were people who realized that
we were leaving good h.mes to go Into a
land unknown to us. ready to lay down
our lives that the honor and dignity of
our nation be maintained. Since our ar
rival in this city we have received the
best of treatment nt the hands of the
citizens, and to the patriotic women of
the Red Cross Society and to those who
have .so kindly assisted us. we wish to
return our thanks. All we ask of those
who find a pleasure in commenting on our
condition is to wait until we have bo^ri
given an opportunity of demonstrating
our true worth. Then, if we do not credit,
ourselves as loyal Americans should, wo
will merit the unfavorable comment. Our
battle cries are: "Stand up for Kansas!"
and "Remember the Maine!"
T trust this will cause those who have
seen fit to "guy" us to think and not
speak rashly. Yours respectfully.
A KANSAS VOLUNTEER.
DIED FOR HIS COUNTRY.
First Death in the First Regi
ment of California
Volunteers.
Sergeant James F. McCarthy, Company
D. of the First Regiment of California
Volunteers, died at the post hospital of
pneumonia yesterday morning. He was
the first man of the State's volunteers to
die in the service of the Government, and
hy the order of Colonel Morris,^com
mandant of the Presidio, he will be given
a military funeral and laid to rest in the
peaceful cemetery upon the reservation.
The funeral will take place at 10:30
o'clock this morning, and a detachment
from the Seventh Regiment will escort
the remains to the grave.
Sergeant McCarthy contracted a severe
cold about ten days ago, and it rapidly
developed into pneumonia. The soldier
remained on duty until he could hardly
stand, and thrn reported at the regi
mental hospital for treatment. Major
McCarthy, the camp surgeon, realizing
Sergeant McCarthy's serious condition,
sent him to the posi hospital on last Mon
day where he lingered for exactly one
week. He rapidly grew worse after he
had been removed, and when the end
came he whs unconscious. Only the hos
pital attendants were with Sergeaxit Mc-
Carthy when he died. His comrades
were hot aware of his serious condition,
and the news of his death only served to
cast a gloom over the entire regiment.
ILL WITH PNEUMONIA.
The Life of Private Solomon of
the Seventh Regiment
Despaired of.
Major J. J. Choate, who succeeds Major
McCarthy in command of the Volunteer
Hospital Corps, will keep the regimental
hospital where it has always been. He
will make no changes. Captains Russell
and Roblee are detailed for duty at the
regimental hospital. Major Choate re
ported yesterday that the case of Privato
Solomon of Company E of the Seventh
Kegiment," who was sent a few days ago
to the post hospital suffering with pneu
monia to be very serious. The soldier's
condition is critical, and Major Choate
expresses very little hope of his recovery.
Five of the patients who have been io the
rarlmental hospital Buffering from vaxi
cms minor ailments were discharged yes
terday as recovered and joined their
commands.
The spot where the First Regiment
camped presented a most deserted ap
pearance yesterday. All of the tents had
been removed, with the exception of
Colonel Smith's headquarters, and once
again a barren, snndy and wind-swept
field greeted the gaze* of the visitors
Where Sunday stood the white canvas

Seventh cleaned up the ground, and the
property was taken in charge by the

When the City of Peking passes through
the Golden Gate, which will probably not
be before to-morrow morning, the guns
of Alcatraz will boom out a farewell sa

according to military and naval etiquette,
but in view of the significance of the de
parture of the advance guard of the first
army of invasion that has ever been dis
patched from the United States since the
war with Mexico, and the first this Gov
ernment has ever sent to the eastern
hemisphere, as well as the sentiment at
tached to the regiment selected for this
honor, the situation justifies the authori
ties in straining a point. Accordingly, a
salute of eleven guns will be fired when
the troopship passes through the Golden
Gate This is the salute a brigadier-gen
eral is entitled to, and although General
Anderson may not be on board the I e
king the fact that the ship has on board

Colonel Berry of the Seventh California

Otis that his regiment has been selected
to go on the second expedition to the
Philippines. This is welcome news to the
men of the Seventh, who are anxious to

No day or hour has yet been set for the

the same time.
This morning five companies of the

It has been settled at army head
quarters that Alcatrax guns may salute
the Philippine expedition as it passes out
to-morrow. General Anderson, as a brig
adier general, is entitled to eleven guns.
It is suggested that there might be an
expansion of military form to allow a
gun or two for Colonel Totter of the
Engineer Corps. He went before an ex
amining board yesterday for his promo
tion from lieutenant to captain of engi
neers in the I'niteJ States army. In the
volunteer service he ranks as lieutenant
colonel He performed excellent service
in building the fortiftaations of this har
bor It IS a sure thing that he wih do
eood work when he gets to Manila.
Apart however, from all military con
siderations Colonel Fotter is entitled to a
palute on account of his size and beauty
of his disposition. Lieutenant S. A. Clo
man U. S. A., who may soon he a
colonel, is also entitled to a salute, which
he is sure to receive from the University

As to the Philippines, an acute stage

istry. The Government of the United

A .-distant Secretary of War Meikle
john, consenting to the use of his
name, told me that the Government
had every disposition to be reasonable
and fair in its compensation for the
transportation "of troops to the Philip
pines, but one thing might as well be
distinctly understood â that these
troops had to be taken across the Pa
cific and put at the service of General
Merritt. Mr. Meiklejohn was disposed
to admit every necessity for prompt
ness that had for two days been point
ed out by the Herald, and was frank
to- say that the question of transporta
tion had been the ouly one to embar
rass him.
"Having provided for 7100 troops this
week," I asked, "what provision has
been made for the remainder of the
18,000 or 20.000 troops asked for by
General Merritt?"
He made no direct reply, but it may
be said that the Government now has
doubtful means of carrying next week
only 5000 more troops. This is the ca
pacity of six boats for which the Gov
ernment is now negotiating. These
six boats are expected to be furnished
by the Northern Steamship Company,
whose ships ply between Tacoma and
Hongkong.

CONSIDERING WAR
REVENUE BILL
Five Hours' Time Taken Up in the
Sena.te by Dissertations
on Taxation.
WASHINGTON, May 23.â For five
hours to-day the Senate had the war
revenue measure under discussion.
The entire time was occupied by Chil
ton (D.) of Texas, L,odge (R.) of Mas
sachusetts and Turley (D.) of Tennes
see.
While Lodge confined himself to a
discussion of the proposed tax on cor
porations and bank deposits, strongly
urging that such taxes be not imposed,
Chilton and Turley covered pretty fully
the general features of the bill. Their
speeches dealt comprehensively with
the theories of taxationand were, there
fore, in the very nature of things, legal
and technical dissertations upon the
subject. No action of any kind was
taken upon the bill.

"We paid for the Peking $30,000,"
said the Assistant Secretary, "and we

"Will you simply temporarily con

"No. A commission will be appointed
to settle upon an adequate and reason
able compensation, and they will have
to go whether they will or not."
Mr. Meiklejohn, while proceeding in

No sutlers are to be permitted to ac

who are acquainted with the operations

up for any deficiency in supplies which
might be missed by debarring the sut

be supplied to the soldiers at cost j

NEW YORK, May 23.â A dispatch to

says: Direct Santiago advices say that
the appearance of the Spanish fleet off
that port compelled four American
cruisers, then bombarding it, to retire.
On entering the port Admiral Cervera
discovered that when the Americans,
who would now know his position, re
turned in force his fleet would be en
trapped, as only one ship at a time
could pass the channel, so the ships
quickly coaled and went out, purposing
to try to catch the American ships sep
arately, if possible, or, at any rate, to
give Sampson battle on the open sea.
The fleet went northerly.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 24, 1898.
Americans Heavily Handicapped by
the Greater Speed of the
Spanish Ships.
CALL OFFICE, Riggs House, Washington, D. C, May 23.
Admiral Sampson and Commodore Schley are probably scour
ing the Caribbean Sea to-night in search of Admiral Cervera's
squadron of Spanish ships.
Commodore Schley, according to "dead reckoning" of the Navy
Department, arrived off the harbor of Santiago at least twenty-four
hours ago, and if the Spanish squadron had not then left the de
partment is confident it has been effectually bottled up.
Admiral Sampson left Key West Friday night, a fact stated in
these dispatches at the time, and since somewhat tardily confirmed
by Secretary Long. Following in the wake of Schley's fleet the
senior commander is believed to have rapidly overhauled his sub
ordinate and to have reached Santiago but a few hours after him.
That Cervera had left some time before Schley's arrival is the belief
of every experienced official of the Navy Department who ven
tured an opinion on the subject to-day.
Whither the Spanish fleet has sailed
is the question that the board of strat
egy would give much to settle, but in
default of information from Washing
ton as to the whereabouts of Cervera,
Sampson and Schley are probably
cruising swiftly about In the hope of
gaining some tidings of the fleeing
Spaniards.
"With the advantage of at least four
knots an hour in the average speed, the
Spanish squadron need not be over
taken so long as coal can be had. If
Sampson could keep the fleet In sight,
to run it down would be but a simple
matter, but as Cervera can leave Samp
son's swiftest vessels below the horizon
In a few hours' run, it becomes neces
sary to employ some other means to
keep track of him. The hope of the
| Navy Department is that the bunkers
of the Spanish squadron â¢will become
exhausted speedily, and under such
conditions they cannot be refilled.
The best Information obtainable is to
the effect that when Cervera steamed
Into Santiago his ship had less than
one-half a full supply of coal on board,
as owing to the operation of the neu
trality proclamations of the various
countries but small quantities of fuel
were supplied at the West Indian ports
at which the fleet had touched.
Santiago appears on the charts of the
bureau of navigation as a "flrst-clas
coaling station," which means that up
ward of a thousand tons of coal ca
be had there under normal condition
The Navy Department has special in
formation in this case, however, to th
effect that there is practically no coa
at Santiago unless sent there by co
Hers within a few days.
With an Inadequate supply of coa
Cervera is terribly handicapped. Spec
in getting out of range and out of sigh
is his sole point of superiority, but i
developing speed above twelve knot
an hour his coal consumption is mor
than doubled. The cruiser New Yor
burns three times as much coal whe
making fifteen knots as when makin
ten, and the Spanish ships ai amena
ble to the same rule. Unless collier
have been provided by the Spanis
Government and can be promptly lo
cated by the Spanish Leet, its destruc
tion is only a matter of a comparative
ly short time. The Navy Departmen
knows that several colliers were sent t
West Indian waters before war wac'de
clared, but aside from those that me
Cervera at Willemstad, Curacoa, no in
formation has been received concern
ing the whereabouts of any of them.
With two powerful cruising fleets in
Cuban waters and a squadron of moni
tors guarding the ' Yucatan passage the
War Department feels that the invas
ion of Cuba need not longer be post
poned, and all speed is being made in
preparing for the transportation of the
troops, a large contingent of which may
leave Tampa before the end of the pres
ent week. It is suggested that 20,000
men be landed on Cuban soil west of
Havana and strong fortifications
thrown up to serve as a base of opera
tions. The landing of a larger force
would follow later without difficulty.
BATTLE-SHIP OREGON
SAFE AT KEY WEST.
NEW YORK, * May 23.â A Washington special to the Herald says: There is no longer any uneasiness
about the Oregon. She is safe at Key West. 'After a race against time for nearly 14,000 miles, the vessel has
reached Sampson's base of supplies, and will, after replenishing her coal bunkers, be ready to go to sea
and perform her part in the task :of destroying the Spanish fleet. Though no details can be learned as to
the condition of the Oregon, it is evident, from the excellent time; she made on the latter part of her voyage
that no serious defects in her machinery have developed. It is expected that she will take on a full sup
ply of coal as rapidly as possible, and while this is being put aboard, her entire engine â¢' room force will be
busily engaged in going over her engines and boilers and putting them into shape for the work she has be
fore her. In many respects the run of the Oregon from San Francisco, down the western coast of the con
tinent, through the straits of Magellan and : up the Atlantic â  coast to Key West, â¢is the most remarkable
that has ever been made by a naval vessel. Never before has a great battleship been driven at her highest
cruising speed for such a long distance,' and that the Oregon has been able to do so well is a high testimo
nial, not only to the skill with which she has been handled, but also to the work of her designers and build
ers.:' V - ; > . â â  ";

With either Sampson or Schley to fur
nish support It would be possible to
transport and land the troops while one
of tbe naval commanders continued the
pursuit of Cervera's "vanishing squad-
A Bigmificant indication that an early
invasion is contemplated is found in the
semi-official statement made at the
War Department to-day that General
Miles' attitudte which has been reported
as opposed to the landing of troops in
Cuba at this time has been misrepre
sented and that he is in favor of prompt
action. On his behalf it is said that he
has "earnestly and determinedly op
posed sending a few thousand men to
Cuba with a great quantity of Btores
and equipment, trusting to the support
which might be given by the Gomez
army, and that it is likely that an in
vasion of that sort might have occurred
a week or two ago had he not so ear
nestly opposed it and to that extent
only, it is declared, is he responsible
for the dolay."
He has taken the ground that It
would be a very unwise risk to send
so small a force; that it would en
danger the lives of the few thousand
men sent, possibly resulting In our
stores falling into the hands of the
enemy, and thus giving them supplies
which Spain is unable to furnish them,
and that it would do very little toward
hastening a conclusion of the war, even
if the men were able to defend them
selves and their stores. He has ad
vocated, it is asserted, an immediate
invasion of the island with a force of
between seventy and one hundred thou
sand men, and that this force should
be landed as nearly as possible at the
same time at different points.
This programme is now about to be
followed, with the possible variation
above suggested of landing a part of
the force a few days in advance.
Arrangements were to-day completed
for the Philippine expedition. The
troops are to receive a month's pay in
advance, a special corps of paymasters
having been detailed for the purpose
under the act of Congress passed to
day. General Wesley Merritt, in his
capacity of Military Governor, will at"
cmce undertake the collection of the
revenues of the Philippine Islands, es
timated at $20,000,000 per year, a sched
ule of tariff and port charges having
been drafted by the Treasury Depart
ment, and hence it is probable that the
American army in Manila will speedily
become a self-sustaining institution.
Commander Hemphill, who has
charge of the naval enlistment, has
made out a table showing that the re
cent recruiting of the navy has swelled
that branch of the service by recruits

New Hampshire 22, Massachusetts 1474.

The announcement by way of Paris
that the Italian Government has pro
tested against the continuance of the
blockade on the Cuban coast on the
j ground that It was Ineffective met a
prompt denial at the State De
partment, and It can be stated
definitely that neither in Washington
nor Rome have any representations on
this subject been addressed to the Uni
ted States Government. As a matter
of fact, Italy probably is the maritime
power of all others with which the Uni
ted States has had absolutely no corre-*
spondence in the slightest degree con
nected with the Cuban blockade.
As to the allegation that the block
ade is ineffective, it is said that, on the
contrary, it has been singularly suc
cessful, and that so far as known not
a single neutral ship subject to deten
tion has passed the lines without the
express consent of our Government
With the beginning of the present
week all Spanish vessels in the United
States which sailed after the outbreak
of war, are subject to seizure, as well
as all Spanish merchantmen found on
the high seas, save those that left port
j for the United States before April 21
last. The President's proclamation of
war allowed such ships lying in our
ports or bound for them thirty days
in which to discharge cargo and also
insured them safe passage home. That
period of time expired last Saturday
night. This, it is expected, will tend
to free the State Department from com-
Under the energetic management of
Captain Bartlett, who was recalled
from the retired list into the active ser
vice of the Navy Department for the
purpose, there has just been perfected
a most admirable and thorough system
of coast signaling for war purposes.
The Navy Department itself estab
lished thirty stations on the coast,
manned by naval militiamen. Then it
called into service 1060 lighthouse em
ployes and 1000 life-saving men, mak
ing a total of over 3000 men who patrol
the great shore line from Bar Harbor
to Galveston night and day and in all
weathers, watching for the approach of
an enemy or for a signal from any
passing United States warship.
It has been arranged that all of these
watchers can communicate In the
course of a few minutes with a tele
graph or telephone line, and all center
in the office of Captain Bartlett in the
Navy Department, who is thus pre
pared to give the War Board instant
notice of any significant ship move
ments on the coast.
It is said at the Navy Department
that it will be at least five days before
the Monterey can be started on her
long journey from San Francisco for
Manila, the delay being on account of
the preparations that must be made for
the very exceptional service required of
the vessel.

SERIOUS
SITUATION
IN SPAIN
Bread Riots That May Soon
Lead Up to a Revo
lution.
Malcontents and Opponents of Re
gency May Join in Civil War
Under Weyler.
Copyrighted, IS9S. bjr_JameÂ« Gordon Bennett.
MADRID, May 23.â The situation in
Spain is much more serious than it is
generally said to be. Black clouds are
gathering over the peninsula, and, in
spite of all that will be done or will be
attempted, it will be impossible to
avoid the storm, which will burst with
terrible effect and sweep away every
thing in its path. But the great ques
tion which will evidently cause a revo
lutionary movement, of which I have
spoken, is of bread. The bread ques
tion has already led to sanguinary con
flicts in some towns in the provinces.
There have been some killed and
wounded among the rioters, upon whom
the troops fired, and if quiet has been
established in Madrid it is because the
Mayor, Count de Romanones, has been
able to make temporary arrangements
with the bakers.
Spain is Just now passing through a
very serious economic crisis. It is the
result of an extraordinary rise in ex
change on Prance, which one day
reached 111 per cent. Taking advan
tage of exchange, French and Belgian
corn factors have bought up all the
wheat in Spain, which they at once ex
ported, realizing considerable profits,
and when the Cortes urgently passed a
bill forbidding the export of cereals it
was too late. The stock, of corn and
wheat had already crossed the frontier,
leaving Spain without food for her
own people. It, therefore, became ne- I
cessary to buy flour abroad at ruinous j
prices to meet the immediate needs,
and the exchange made the Spaniards
lose considerable sums which have been
gained by the French and Belgians. !
Hence the rise in the price of bread, j
and hence the general discontent in the j
provinces and sanguinary demonstra- j
tlons.
In Madrid the rise has not yet made
itself felt, because the Mayor promised
to indemnify the bakers with municipal
funds, but the credits allotted for this
purpose are not large, and when they
are exhausted Madrid bakers will also
be obliged to raise their prises. What
will happen then? That is what is most
feared in Government circles. The peo
ple, already in sore straits, will inevi
tably join the numerous political and
other malcontents, and the result may
very well be a civil war, tor the mal
contents and opponents of the regency
â Carlists, Republicans, Socialists and
Anarchists â who, if an opportunity
arose, would group themselves under
General Weyler with the sole object of
overturning the Queen Regent, already
form an imposing majority.
After this revolution, which the army
will be powerless to put down, will Don
Carlos come into power or will a re
public be proclaimed? It is very dif
ficult to prophesy on this point. It is
certain, however, that the Queen Re
gent does not enjoy much sympathy
among the people. The movement

Cruiser St. Louis and Tug Waropatuck: Silence tr;e Guns on Shore
and Emerge prom the Conflict With Slight
Injury.
CHARLOTTE AMALIA, Island of St. Thomas, D. W. 1., May 23.â The firing at Santiago de Cuba on Wednesday, May 18, was be
tween the Spaniards there and two American vessels.
Acting under orders from Admiral Sampson, the auxiliary cruiser St. Louis and the tug Wampatuck went to Santiago for the purpose
of cutting the cable there. The cable was picked up within range of the guns of Morro Castle, and the Spaniards at once opened fire on the Amer
icans. Two sand batteries and one mortar battery on shore at the bottom of the height on which Morro is situated joi ned in the firing, to which the
Americans responded. The aim of the Spanish gunners was atrociously bad.
The men who were detailed to cut the cable grappled for it from the deck of the St Louis. They found it with little difficulty and coolly
lifted it to the forecastle of the St. Louis, where it was cut, the Spaniards meanwhile doing their best to disable the cruiser.
The engagement was lively while it lasted. The St. Louis brought her total armament of four six-pounders into play, while the
Wampatuck used her one three-pounder. With this small armament the Americans finally succeeded in silencing all but two or three of the
Spanish guns
Neither of the American Vessels were seriously damaged. A topmast back-stay on the St. Louis was shot away, and the pilot-house
of the Wampatuck slightly splintered.
One man on the St. Louis had a finger broken by a flying fragment of shell while handling the cable.
When the Americans had completed their work at Santiago they proceeded some twenty miles to the eastward, where they entered the bay
of Guantanamo, they being under orders to cut the cable there also.
While they were picking up the cable in the bay the Spanish batteries opened fire on them, but the guns being small and poorly handled,
were ineffective. Two well placed shots from the St. Louis secured comparative quiet and the work of further crippling Blanco's communication with
the outside world was peacefully accomplished.
The Americans laugh at the gunnery of the Spaniards. They are highly pleased with the success of their task. The armament of the St.
Louis and Wampatuck is ridiculously small for fighting purposes, and it is thought more powerful vessels should be employed when it is necessary
for them to run directly within the range of shore fortifications.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, May 23.
Naval officials have calculated to
their entire satisfaction the possibility
of getting the Monterey safely across
the Pacific to Admiral Dewey'g squad
ron at Manila. The principal diffi
culty in making such a trip as this is
the small coal carrying capacity of ves
sels of the Monterey type. She car
ries normally 2300 tons in her bunkers,
which, at her most economical rate of
Bteaming, would take her about three
hundred miles less than the distance
from San Francisco to Honolulu. In
emergencies such as the present It is
possible to store a good deal of coal on
the main deck, being placed in pas
page ways and open spaces of the su
perstructure of the vessel.
The great beam of the Monterey
â¢would permit 190 tons of coal to be car
ried in addition to that in the bunkers
without in the least endangering the
stability of the ship or risking the loss
of coal by being washed overboard. At
her economical speed of 190 knots per
day this coal would last her seventeen
days and carry her 3200 knots. Ow
ing to the carefully laid plans of the
Navy Department, the Monterey, now
on her long cruise, will be obliged to
make a run of 2100 knots without an
opportunity to coal. The ship will
take a southerly course after leaving
Honolulu in company with a steam col
lier. The South Seas are full of isl
ands, and as soon as she has left Ha
waii 1000 miles behind her and in the
sheltered harbors of these islands it
will be very easy for the Monterey to
lie alongside and coal through her su
perstructure. It would not be sur
prising if one of the harbors chosen for
such a transfer was in the Caroline
Islands, another Spanish possession in
the South Seas, for by so doing there
could be no possible complaint of a
breach of neutrality laws on the part of
any neutral nation. From the Caro
lines to the Philippines the way is easy
and under the programme arranged
there is no probability of failure in
the attempt to get the Monterey safe
ly across the Pacific. The Spanish
squadron at Cadiz, which reports from
Spain state is going to the Philippines,
is capable of higher speed than the
Monterey and may not have much dif
ficulty in obtaining the necessary coal
to make the trip, so that even though
the distance be longer on the eastward
trip there are possibilities of a most in

M'PARTLAND LOSES HIS
TEMPER AND THE FIGHT.
Fouls Jack Daly in Their Contest at
New York and the Delaware
Lad Gets the Decision.
NEW YORK May 23.â Jack Daly of
Wilmington. Del., got a' decision on a
four over Kid McPartland of this city,
after having fought fourtepn and a half
rounds In the Lenox Athletic Club to
night. Daly was the favcylte In the bet
ting, $100 to $90 b*Â»ing laid on his chances.
Both men turned the scales at 142
pounds at 3 o'clock this afternoon, and
when they stripped to-night they were In
excellent trim. The bout was a rattling
good one while it lasted, but from the
eighth round it was very evident that
Daly would get the better of McPartland.
as the latter lost control of his temper.
McPartland sprung a new blow in the
second round â a left jab on the face,
quickly brought down to the kidneys.
While both men clinched repeatedly, the
fighting up to the eighth round was fa-st
and neither had any apparent advantage.
In round eight Daly landed heavily and
rushed Mac to his rorner. When they
came up again both started to slug, and a
strong uppercut on the nose caused the
New Yorker to lose his temper com
pletely. Daly slipped to the floor, and
when he was half down. Mac hit him.
There was an uproar in the house at this
moment, while the referee kept Aiac
from fouling. In the twelfth round Mac
rushed Daly to his corner and doubled
him up with a punch in the wind. There
were frequent clinches and Daly claimed
Mac hit him low on the body.
In the fourteenth round Daly stopped
Mac with a hard right on the head and
got his eye split in return. In the next
round Daly rushed and landed heavily on
the head.
In the final round the boys rushed into
a clinch, from which Referee White got
them to break. Daly rushed and
slammed McPartland right and left. In
a clinch Mac struck Daly and the latter
fell. White rolled over him, hurting
Daly's leg. Mac walked to his corner and
TJfely limped to his. This ended the bout
and Charley Harvey announced that the
referee had awarded the decision to Daly
on account of McPartland having struck

CUBA'S CAPITAL
TO BE BOMBARDED
FROM THE SKIES
Inventor Eddy Perfects a Device by
Which; Dynamite May Be Dropped
Into the City's Fortifications.
NEW YORK, May 23.â 1t is proposed to attack Havana not .only from sea and land, but also from
the skies. William A. Eddy, of camera kite fame, has a plan to drop dynamite on the Cuban capital
from the clouds.
Mr. Eddy said to-day he had provided Lieutenant Wise, of the Ninth Infantry, with an outfit of
his patent kites, with camera attachments, which are to be taken to Cuba with the army of invasion,
and flown over Havana for the purpose of getting birdseye views of the interior of all fortifications,
both on the coast and on the land side, where much work has recently been done in the way of
strengthening old works and throwing up new batteries.
This, it is believed, will be of inestimable advantage to the troops engaged in the siege, as well
as to the vessels of the American fleet charged with the duty of silencing the fortifications and bat
teries on both sides of the harbor mouth.
If this plan proves feasible, of which Mr. Eddy entertains little doubt, he expects a trial will be
made of his new device whereby large masses of dynamite may be carried up by a series of kites and
then, by means of a simple releasing device, caused to fall within the enemy's lines. A series of kites
for this purpose has been designed, the main kite being twenty feet wide, with a carrying capacity of
seventy pounds of dynamite, sufficient, if dropped at the proper moment, to demolish the most powerful
battery.
If preliminary tests with the camera prove successful, Mr. Eddy expects to be invited to accom
pany the army to Cuba and superintend the aerial bombardment of Havana.

LEAVES BEHIND
A SWEETHEART
Announcement of His Eogagerr)eQt
to Miss Laura Williams of
Chicago.
CHICAGO, May 23. â The formal announcement of the engagement
of Miss Laura Williams, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Norman Williams of
Chicago, and granddaughter of the late Judge John Dean Caton. to
Major General Wesley Merritt, military Governor of the Philippine
Islands, was made to-day.
Miss Williams is about 20 years old, a brunette, graceful and pe
tite, but of striking appearance, with jet black hair and eyes and bril
liant coloring. She has received much attention here and abroad, and
especially in London, where she was the guest of Robert T. Lincoln,
when he was the representative of this country at the court of St.
James. She was presented at the Queen's drawing room with Miss
Lincoln. Norman Williams has for a number of years been one of the
well-known figures in Chicago legal and financial circles.
General Merritt wfes born in Illinois and is a graduate of West
Point. He entered the army directly after graduation in 1861. In April,
1863, he was appointed brijradier general, and his services throughout
the war were of the most distinguished form. Since its close he has
made a name for himself in Indian fighting, and in 1895 he was made
a major general.
General Merritt left for the Pacific Coast to-night on a special car
attached to the 6 o'clock train on the Chicago and Northwestern Rail
road. He refused to be interviewed and the members of his staff
maintained the same reticence.

SPANISH TACTICS.
I-* HE success with which the Spanish fleet in the
West Indies has played a game of hide and seek
"â ". among the islands of the Caribbean Sea for so
long a time tells heavily against any hope of a speedy
end to the war. To make a campaign short, sharp
and decisive it is necessary to have a foe who can be
found easily An artful dodger, however readily he
might be overcome in battle, is i ot to be captured
quickly when he has room enough to make good use
of his nimble legs.
The tactics which have been employed by the
Spanish are such as were to have been expected of
them both from the conditions of the war and from
their national characteristics. No weak people pitted
against a strong nation and forced to fight at a great
distance from their base of supplies would be
guilty of the folly of risking everything on the result
of a single battle. However daring and bold they
might be prudence would prevent them from rushing
to a combat where defeat w^ould mean ruin. The
bravest of races under such circumstances would pur
sue a Fabian policy and seek to achieve by strategy
what they could not hope to gain by direct fighting.
These tactics which circumstances render wise on
their part are the more acceptable to the Spaniards
because they are in accord with Spanish methods of
making war. It has never been their policy to fight
pitched battles when such conflicts could be avoided.
Their national existence has been maintained in
Europe solely by their indomitable courage in guer
rilla warfare and their fitness for carrying it on. It
has ever been easy to overthrow their armies, but
never possible to subdue their country. These tactics
which wore out the great Napoleon are now to be ap
plied against us, and, if we are to force the war to a,
swift conclusion, we will have to show not only
strength in fighting the foe, but a tireless speed in
pursuing him.
When Dewey took possession of the arsenal and
the wrecks of the Spanish ships at Manila he found
that orders had been given and preparations were
being made for the removal of the fleet from that
harbor. Had he not descended upon them with the
swiftness of an eagle swooping upon its prey they
would have sailed away, and he would have had be
fore him a game of hide and seek in the Philippines
as tedious and perplexing as that w-hich now exasper
ates Sampson in the West Indies. To his vehement
speed of attack as much as to his daring and his skill
do we owe the victory which has saved our Pacific
Coast and commerce from the menace of Spanish
assault.
It is to be regretted that we were not prepared to
strike in the West Indies as promptly as we did in the
Philippines. The conditions, however, were too dif
ferent to render such a course advisable. The result
is that the Spaniards have Had a chance to get their
ships out of Havana and scatter them around the
Caribbean Sea, where they have been lately joined by
the fleet commanded by Cervera. Now we have be
fore us the long hunt after an enemy whose course
seems to be about as uncertain as that of Andree on
his aerial voyage to the pole. What we need most in
our Atinntic fleet are swift cruisers rather than battle
ships, and unfortunately we have hardly enough of
them for the work. Unless Cervera commits a blun
der or some splendid good fortune attends our arms,
trie West Indian campaign of hide and seek will prob
ably last for a long time to come.
Chief Lees was in evidence yesterday. On a high
stepping horse and decorated with much gold braid
he formed an imposing spectacle The policemen who
followed him marched well and wore their good
clothes. But people did not throng the streets for
the purpose of looking at policemen. Their eyes were
for the soldiers. The province of the police should
have been to keep order. They should have been
ranged along the pavement for the purpose of con
trolling the crowds. As it was, 4 the crowds were un
restrained, and in their enthusiasm made great con
fusion, obstructed the view and created an actual
danger. There is no objection to the chiefs being
as ornamental as possible, but he and the men under
him are paid principally to be useful.
It is extremely difficult to get up a scare on the sup
position that this country is to be invaded from
Mexico. An idea prevails that Diaz might feel like
saying something about it and get his soldiers to
illustrate his remarks.
If the women declare war on France the effect
would be to improve styles, kill off a lot of fads and
give the French a needed lesson in manners.
Perhaps it will be a consolation to Dewey to learn

THE CZfIR-MfIYOR OF NEW YORK
AN object lesson illustrating the Czar-
Mayor theory in practical operation is
opportunely furnished by ex-Judge Van
Wyck, the blue-blooded potentate of Greater
New York. The light which this lesson throws
upÂ«n the charter discussion now in progress
in tlf is city emboldens us to call the attention not
only of the people but of the advocates of the so
called Phelan charter to the plain facts of the case.
To begin with, Mayor Van Wyck is a "reform"
Czar-Mayor. He was chosen because of his high
social position, pure political affiliations and immacu
late pedigree. He is a descendant of the first families
of the metropolis, and during the campaign of last
fall not a single word was said against either his char
acter or integrity. Yet ever since he became Mayor
he has been the willing political instrument of the
Tammany bosses. All his appointments have been
dictated by Boss Croker, and even at this distance it
is perceivable that he is engaged in building up a
Democratic machine in the city of New York which is
destined to be stronger than any that ever existed in
the Empire State before.
The crisis came in the affairs of the combination,
however, when Tammany attempted to get control of
the Police Department. The charter of Greater New
York, like that now pending in this city, provides for
a bi-partisan Police Commission â that is, a commis
sion of four, two Democrats and two Republicans â
and authorizes the Mayor to appoint and remove at
pleasure. Van Wyck started out with two Tammany
Democrats and two Platt Republicans â a commis
sion at once engaging and reformatory in its tenden
cies. But the plan did not work. Either the Platt
Commissioners would not permit the Tammany gam
blers and blackmailers to "run" the city or they were
dissatisfied with the division of spoils allotted to
them. At all events they resisted the enforcement of
the Tammany programme, and Mayor Van Wyck re
moved them.
Of course there are charges of corruption on both
sides. The Tammany bosses declare that Phillips
and Hamilton, the deposed Commissioners, stood be
tween them and the inauguration of reforms in the
department. This, however, is too laughable to ob
tain, general credence. The Platt bosses declare that
their men endeavored to prevent the introduction of
the Tammany machine into the department. There is
every reason to believe that this is true, for Van Wyck
has replaced Phillips and Hamilton with two Tam
many Republicans.
Nor is the quarrel likely to end here. Governor
Black, a Platt Republican, is talking about "remov
ing" Van Wyck. It appears that the charter of Great
er New York invests him with some such power. The
; immediate result, however, has been to completely
i disorganize the New York Police Department. Chief
i McCullough has been dismissed and the heads of sev-
eral of his captains are on the block. The entire force
! are now engaged, not in maintaining the law and pre
serving the peace, but in running about to secure the
I "pull" necessary to keep their places. There is no
i confidence in civil service rules at such a crisis. But
it appears that the Governor may suspend Van Wyck.
No such authority exists under the charter pending
in this city. Here if the Mayor elected under the in
strument were to remove two Police Commissioners
who refused to give all the places to the Sullivan fac
tion of the local Democratic party no power on earth
could menace him. Indeed, the Mayor is the only
I official of our proposed charter for whose removal or
suspension no provision has been made.
THE TORPEDO-BOAT.
I ;OR years past the interest of the general public
in naval affairs has been mainly centered in tor-
pedo-boats. These little craft that were supposed
to be able to dive under water and come up under or
near a massive battle-ship and blow her to fragments
appealed to popular imagination. They were sug
gestive of the wonderful ship of Jules Verne"s
"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea." The
average man read of them with thrilling interest and
held vast and undefined expectations of what they
would accomplish as soon as the dogs of war were
loosed and they were sent free like demons of the
deep to ravage the ocean and the multitudinous seas
incarnadine.
We have been at war for more than a month, and
the only torpedo-boat that has distinguished herself is
the Winslow. Her distinction lies in the fact that she
got herself knocked to pieces by presuming on her
ability to whip a land battery and sink some Spanish
ships lying under its protection. This incident shows
that the torpedo is not so invulnerable as popular
fancy supposed. It clearly demonstrates that there are
some things in the way of naval destruction that the
magic craft will have to leave to more old-fashioned
ships to perform.
Before hostilities began we heard much of the
torpedo-boats the Spanish had gathered at Havana,
and our patriotic fears were aroused lest in the night
they should slip out from the harbor under the cover
of darkness, approach our blockading fleet, dive un
der water, sink a battle-ship or two and return in
safety to be greeted like the matador who had made a
daring stroke in a bull-ring. Not a thing, however,
have these marvelous Spanish torpedoes accom
plished. So idle have they been that some people are
beginning to doubt their existence.
Admiral Dewey steamed into Manila harbor as
careless of mines and of torpedo-boats as if such
things had no more terrors than so many sea ser
pents. He moved his squadron close in to the shal
low waters of Cavite Bay and banged a- ay at the
Spanish arsenal, land batterier and ships with as
much coolness as if he lived and was fighting in days
before torpedo-boats were invented. Indeed, a casual
observer watching him as he made his way into the
port through the darkness and following his man
euvers in the battle would be inclined to believe that
he had never heard of these dread machines of mod
ern war and was brave through a blissful ignorance of
his danger.
The war is as yet young, and before it closes the
torpedo-boat may get in its deadly work. Up to this
time, however, the public has awaited in vain for the
thrill of its first startling, devastating blow. Spain
has many such boats and so have we. Sooner or
later one of them will show its ability as a fighting
machine and we shall then have a better conception
of its power. In the meantime it is significant that
neither side seems to rely much upon them. The
Spanish have never launched one of theirs ag-ainst
our blockading ships, and we, after putting the Win
slow up against a land battery, will hardly repeat the
experiment.
The citizen who immediately after the Manila affair
named his new boy Dewey, his own name being Dun
ham, makes his meaning plain enough even if there
is involved an assault on grammar.
Now the boys of the First know what we think of
them anyhow.
THE SAN FRAXCtSCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 24, 1898.
ANNEXATION ARGUMENT.
THE New York Journal yells for Hawaiian an
nexation with a zeal which suggests a contingent
fee that is needed in its business.
In a late issue the Journal says that annexation was
the policy of Presidents Tyler, Taylor, Fillmore,
Pierce, Johnson, Grant and Harrison, and Secre
taries of State Webster, Calhoun, Buchanan, Clayton,
Marcy, Scward, Fish, Frelinghuysen, Blame and Fos-
ter. This is a sweeping misrepresentation of history
and a palpable falsehood. Of the lists of Presidents
quoted only Harrison favored annexation, and of the
Secretaries only Foster. It is true that Marcy did
negotiate an annexation treaty, but it was at the insti
gation of a weak ruler of the islands, and was never
ratified. Marcy's real policy seems to have been, ex
pressed in the reciprocity treaty which he negotiated
with Mr. Lee, the Hawaiian representative. The
other statesmen named are all on record for the
autonomy and independence of the islands.
American statesmen have been aware of two possi
ble embarrassments in the Hawaiian situation; one
arising in their ownership as a colony by the United
States, the other in their passing under the dominion
of any European power. The latter was amply pro
vided against by the Anglo-French treaty of 1842, by
which Great Britain and France agreed never in any
manner or form, directly or indirectly, to assume
dominion or control of Hawaii. While the United
States was not a party to that treaty in fact, it brought
that two nations that were into line with us and made
the acquisition of the islands by any European power
impossible, since any one attempting it roust antago
nize Great Britain, Franc? and this republic.
The islands were guaranteed in their independence
and neutrality with autonomy as a state in the
American system of nations and all the rights of a
government within the Monroe hemisphere. From
that policy we have never varied until the machina
tions of Minister Stevens in 1893 put in power a mi
nority and erected a military oligarchy sustained by 2
per cent of the people. The position of all the
American statesmen named by the Journal, with the
two exceptions noted, was never better stated than
by Blame himself. In his official letter of Novem
ber 19, 1881, to Comly, our Minister at Honolulu, he
said:
"The Government of the United States has. tcith
unvarying consistency, manifested respect for the in
dependence of the Hawaiian kingdom and an earnest
desire for the welfare of its people. It has always
felt and acted on the conviction that the possession of
the islands by a peaceful and prosperous power, with
which there was no possibility of controversy or col
lision, was most desirable, in reference to its own
large and rapidly increasing interests in the Pacific.
It has declined, even at the request of the Hawaiian
people, to assume over their affairs a protectorate,
which would only be a thinly disguised domination,
and it has confined its efforts and influence to
strengthening their government and opening to their
commerce and enterprise the readiest and most profit
able connection with its own markets."
Now, that was a plain statement of our historic
policy. From that policy Mr. Blame contemplated
only one cause of deviation, which he said would be
in a tendency on the part of the Hawaiian Govern
ment to drift toward the Asiatic system, in which
event an American solution would become necessary.
It will be seen that the Journal's statement is false,
as the reasons for it are probably corrupt, and this is
a good time to suggest that the people should be on
their guard against innovations and novelties in our
national policy which are urged by newspapers like
Hearst's, notorious for blackmail, corruption and the
leasing of their editorial opinions on time contracts
to anybody who will pay the price demanded.
Our policy toward Hawaii has been to support neu
trality and independence and control her trade by the
natural gravitation of commerce. Nothing has hap
pened to make necessary a change in this policy, and
it is unlikely that anything will happen to justify it.
THE OREGON ELECTION.
DEMOCRATIC opposition in Congress to the
bond clause of the war revenue bill raises a
distinct issue against the administration on an
important measure growing out of the conflict with
Spain. It is clearly the intention of the Democratic
leaders to make this issue the dominant one in the
campaign before the people in the coming Congres
sional elections, and therefore a new interest is given
to the contest now going on in "Oregon, where a Con
gressional as well as a State ticket is to be elected on
June 6.
The "war issue," as it may be called, has been
sprung suddenly upon the Oregon voters, for it was
not foreseen at the time the party platforms were
made and the rival candidates nominated, but it will
not take them unawares nor find them unprepared to
deal with it. No elaborate campaign of education will
be needed to inform the intelligent voters of that
State of the meaning of the question submitted to
them, nor of the effect which their decision upon it
will have throughout the country. They will under
stand at once that it is but a new form of the old
issue of good money against bad, of safe finance
against rash experiment; and that if they should vote
against the administration on this issue the effect
would be to weaken the power of the country in war
by discrediting to some extent the security of its
bonds and the value of its money.
There is no weakness in the position taken by Ore
gon Republicans on the issue between gold and free
silver. The declaration of the party platform on that
question is a model of strength and clearness. This
fact gives assurance that in facing about to meet the
new form of fiat money attack there will be no lack
of courage or vigor. The conduct of the campaign
on that line will be as welcome to them as it would
have been to go over again the old battle of '96. The
war revenue bill, bond clause and all,-^ust as it passed
the House, will find support from every loyal Repub
lican, and the issue between the administration and its
opponents will be made as sharp and distinct as any
of the Democrats or Populists of the State dare to
confront.
Governor Leedy of Kansas should resign, and, hav
ing thus acquired leisure, devote it to kicking himself.
He is the gentleman who took the uniforms away
from the State troops on learning that they were
going into Federal service. In consequence the gal
lant Kansans are here clad just as they came from
the farm or store. Happily they may be at home
again in time for the next election.
The reporter who affirmed that the Minnesota regi
ment was not well equipped showed extremely bad
judgment. But he is keeping away from the camp,
which shows that he can on occasion exercise judg
ment of a thoroughly sane variety.
Sergeant Green of the police force is to be congrat
ulated. There are few men who can send three sons
away on the country's service and have six left at
home.
THE VOICE OF THE FAIR SOUTHLAND
lOVINGLY laden with flowers the desolate mourners go" is a line from
Judge Flinch's beautiful tribute to Southern women on the Mississippi.
And so surely as the seasons come and go do women gather to pay
tribute to the soldier dead. The tender hand that waved adieu in '61
Is now the wrinkled palm; and the blooming cheek of those eventful days
is crossed by many lines; life's sun-rays slant far past noon; but on this
day of days when Southern womanhood does reverent homage at the shrine
of its dead, the old hark again to the sound of the ringing bugle and to
the stirring drum-beat when the boys in gray marched forth to battle.
Virginia became the Southern cemetery. And in the long, sad Interlude
Rachel has mourned for her children.
It matters ltttle that the issue has been sealed forever. The South haa
long ago accepted that fact, and from desolation has gathered strength.
But there is above it a greater fact, and that is the sacred duty of the citi
zen to defend the home of his fathers. The boys in gray did that until
almost none were left to wield a saber or shoulder a musket. So that the
tomb of a Confederate soldier is more august in its stern and uninviting
aspect than a mausoleum. It is not merely a shrine of liberty; it is liberty
enshrined. The men who dared all, fought with all strength and lost all,
can never cease to be heroes in the sight of their countrymen.
The South has not forgotten; the South cannot forget. The rancor has
faded like a mist; the mad echo of passion has moaned itself still. But
patriotism, reverence and love remain; and love distilled in the magic ves
sel of memory' sheds f.b fragrance on every grave that holds a faithful
soldier of the cause.
It stirs the heart. It brings tears to the eyes, it makes the blood surge
in the veins to witness the beautlfu ceremony of loving hands wreathing
those graves with garlands. It is a part of the blessed ministry of woman
âa right none denies herâ a function at which she is supreme. Upon her,
whether in victory or defeat, the blow has fallen. When the country rang
with tidings of victory, she thought of husband, son or brother that had
bought it with his blood; and when sad faces told of the defeat, she still
counted the cost and reckoned fearfully on a loss that time could not repay.
And now it is her hand that decks the graves and her heart that treasures
deepest the memories of the dead.
The country is again at war; the city is filled with troops mustering for
fight, and there may be more heroes and more graves. The act of the
women to-day shows that no man who does his duty will fall of loving
recognition by the hearts of his countrywomen. He will live green In mem
ory whether he is a general or the humblest private in the ranks.
The occasion calls up the lines of John Esten Cook, written at Kelly
Ford, where the gallant Pelham, our young Marcellus, was slain. A North
ern band had begun playing tho national air, and Cook wrote:
Â»
O band in the pine weeds, cease!
Cease with your splendid call;
The living are brave and noble,
But the dead were bravest of all.
They come with the ringing bugle
And the low drum's hollow roar,
Till the heart is sick with longing
For the forms we see no more.
7^* * a . !lant form 3 that dared death In the early sixties under the stars
and bars have almost disappeared; but they live again on Memorial day.
They come to life at the touch of a woman's hand; they are knights sans
peur et sans reproche in the hearts of Southerh women-God bless our
women, the guardians of our dead.â From The State, Columbia, & C

PERRY'S VISIT TO JAPAI7.
Commodore Dewey Is not the first
American who has led a hostile fleet Into
a harbor of the far East. Commodore
Perry, a brother of the hero of Lake
Erie, was before him. Perry's expedition
was not as bloody as Dewey's, and the
risks he ran were less; there was no
chance of being lifted sky-high by an ex
ploding mme â torpedoes were not then
the thing. There was a brilliant, spec
tacular side to his undertaking.
With the coming of day, July 8, 1853. the
Japanese got the first glimpse of the
slow-moving, sailless invader ships. With
what consternation the alarm must
have spread! A stranger, perhaps a con
queror, his ships moving as no Japanese
ship had ever moved, was already in the
heart of their bay.
Presently the sun got high enough to
dispel the fog and the bay lay open. Still
the invaders moved slowly on. Junks,
brilliantly painted, hovered toward them. j
and got no more attention than if they
were soap bubbles blown upon the shining
surface of the water. A fleet of boats â 
came down the bay to stop the advance
of the ships, and the American plowed
silently through. Immense crowds tnat
had gathered upon every Headland stared
dumfounded.
And then Perry put another touch to
his sphinx-like impudence. Slowing down
his engines, he began sounding the "bay.
At every revolution of the paddles the
lead was thrown. There was no inquiry
of any one where to anchor; no asking of
permission. As indifferent to the junks,
boats, crowds, kingdom round about him
as If he owned the earth, he quietly hunt
ed for an anchorage, found one to his
liking, and let go his ajichors off the city
of ITraga, with his cannon commanding
it. Immediately two guns were lired, evi
dently as signals, from the batteries of
the town, and a rocket leaped Into the air.
And now for the consummation of Per
ry's peculiar plan. He withdrew to his
?abin. Presently an officer came out from
Fraga and desired to parley with the
commodore. He was met with a most
anexpected demand. What was his rank?
The commodore would nave no dealings
except with the officials of the very high
est rank. This one was only the Vice-
Qovernor, and back he must go to Uraga.
For no such small fry as a Vice-Gov
ernor would inscrutable Perry come out
3f his cabin.
Night fell, and Perry did not move. Ex-
Mtement reigned around Yeddo Bay. Guns
were fired. Rockets shot into air. Every
battery on the headlands was thronged
with soldiersâ had been lilling with them
all day. Beacon fires twinkled through
the night here, there, everywhere. Perry
lay Quietly at hi 3 anchors.
The next day the Governor of Uraga
came out to the flagship. This was a lit
tle better than the Vice-Governor, and he
got a trifle better treatment. Imperturb
able Perry still refused to come out of
his cabin, but he delegated one of his offi
cers to receive the governor. But his
excellency must distinctly understand
that this high and mighty commodore
ivfft the bearer of a letter from the still
higher and mightier, the American Presi
dent, to his majesty the Emperor of Ja
pan. The said mighty commodore pro
posed to give this letter up to a great
prince of Japan, and to nobody lower In
rank- That was all there was "about it.
There is only one place in Japan," said
the authorities, "wluue a foreign com
munication can be properly received. You
must go to Nagasaki."
*'I won't," said Perry.
He now began to threaten. For an
Dtiter barbarian to have thriist himself
thus coolly into forbidden waters must
lave surprised Japan enough; but for him
to propose a meeting with the Kmperor
must have been all but past belief. But
that is what Perry did. He issued his
.Utimatum with that for his text. Eith*
tie should get word by Tuesday, July 1'
that the sort of interview he desired" had
seen arranged, or he would himself carry
the letter to the Emperor. Apparently
this amazing commodore, with his pro
roking supply of insulting calmness felt
competent, he and his six Bhips. to make
sne meal of the whole of Japan.
What the Japanese Government thought
tias not been published, but it came to
terms. The great functionary would meet
the commodore, and Thursday. July 14
was set for the interview. " High ar#i
nighty Perry could now come forth from
lis cabin, triumphant at every point. If
that deep, dry. ironical sense ,of humor,
the earmark of â¢ the American, /did- not
twinkle In Perry's eyes.- at least it ought
to have done so.â Cincinnati Commercial

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, May 23.â News
reached here from Bolinas to-day that
a force of armed men has taken forci
ble possession of the property of the
Golden Crown Mining Company, a cor
poration engaged in copper mining two
miles from Bolinas Point. The action,
which has thrown the town into a fu
ror and may yet cause the shedding of
blood, was the outgrowth of a disagree
ment between the officials of the mining
company and Puma Brothers over a
bill for wood cutting.
The trouble dates back to last Janu
ary. Puma Brothers had been engaged
to cut several hundred cords of wood
and the mining company. which in
cludes such prominent men as J. W.
Pierson, the mining operator; J. C. Wi
nans of the Alameda Street Car Com
pany, and Whitelaw, the wrecker,
claimed that the work had not been
performed according to contract. E. B.
MartlnelU, now District Attorney, en
tered suit for Puma Brothers. City At
torney Thomas Boyd was engaged by
the company and succeeded in winning
the case for his clients.
A short time ago Attorney James W.
Cochrane was engaged by Puma Broth
ers to renew the suit. He did so and
last Sunday Constable McCoy of Bo
linas. with a force of deputies, made
a descent upon the mine and carried
off everything portable, including toe
hoisting engine, all the groceries, the
blacksmithing tools, wagons and horses
and anything hands could be laid on.
All these ware stored in a large barn
tome distance away. On last Monday,
the day following this bold sortie, the
mine people lean.cd of what had been
done. Almut a dozen of their employes
ere armed and then the party, led by
young Pierson, proceeded to the barn j
where the goods were stored. The man
in charge was overawed and soon I
everything was on its way back to the
mine, the train comprising a half-dozen j
wagons and the hoisting engine, with
a guard of six men in the lead and as
many in the rear. Everything was put
back in its pla<- â *-.
The Puma Brothers have sworn out i
warrants for the arrest of young Pier
son and every man who helped in re

CALL FOR THE SANTA
BARBARA RESERVES
Commander of the Naval Battalion
Asked to Supply an Emer
gency Muster.
SANTA BARBARA, May 23.â After
many weeks of waiting, with small
prospects of seeing active service, the
naval reserves of Santa Barbara have
received word that their services may
be needed by the Government. Lieu
tenant Hunt, commanding the Naval
Battalion, has received from Cap
tain Turner of the United States
steamship Marion at San Francisco a
request for an emergency muster,
-which means the taking of the names
of those willing to volunteer for ser
vice. Up to 8 o'clock to-night out of
the 104 men composing the battalion
eighty had agreed to enter the service.
The officers believe they will leave here
with ninety men. The number may be
reduced by the failure of some to pass
a physical examination.
The Santa Barbara's naval organiza
tion is composed of the most prominent
men of the city. Lieutenant D. F.
Hunt, commanding, is a member of tho
City Council and has been prominent in
local politics for years. Charles Hunt,
senior ensign, was for many years Dep
uty County Clerk, and is thought to
be the coming candidate on the Repub
lican ticket this fall for County Clerk.
J. W. Taggart and Henley Booth, law
yers of this place, and prospective can
didates for prosecuting attorney this
fall, are members. The departure of
the Naval Reserves will cause the
flashing of many political slates. Santa
Barbara takes great pride In her crack j
organization and expects to see it carry j
Old Olory to honorable distinction in i
this war.

AMERICAN WARSHIPS
ARRIVE AT PARA
LONDON, May 23.â Lloyd's agent at Para, Brazil, under to-day's
date, cables that three American m?n-of-war arrived there at 3 o'clock this
morning from Rio de Janeiro. The only American warships known to be
on their way trom Rio de Janeiro are the Oregon, the Marietta and the
Nictheroy. the Oregon was last reported officially by the Lloyds at Bahia,
Brazil, on May 9. and she is believed to have proceeded at midnight the
same date. The distance from Bahia to Para Is about 1600 miles, roughly
speaking, and if Lloyds' report is correct the Oregon and her consorts have
been steaming very slowly. Other reports have placed the Oregon at
Barbadoes and even nearer still to the United States.

TAMPA, Fla., May 23.â The Red
Cross Society ship State of Texas, with
Miss Clara Barton, representative of
the National Red Cross Society of
America, and a corps of surgeons and
trained nurses, arrived at Port Tampa
to-day and cast anchor near the gun
boat Helena. The vessel, which Is
fully fitted up for hospital purposes and
carries supplies enough for the equip
ment of several Red Cross stations,
will, it is said, follow the fleet of troops
Into Cuban waters.
In speaking of the Red Cross work
In Cuba, Miss Barton said to-day that
she had received assurances from the
highest Spanish official sources that her
hospital at Serro and her headquarters
were being carefully guarded, and that
the Red Cross supplies left there were
being put to their Intended use. In
the hospital at Serro, where sixty chil
dren were being cared for when Miss
Barton left the island, there are now
a hundred and sixty children receiving
medical attention.
"General Blanco himself belongs to
the Red Cross Society of Spain," said
Miss Barton, "and I am confident that
the Red Cross work In Cuba will not
be interfered with."
Miss Barton left for Washington to
night.
J. Castellanos, a young man who ar
rived from Key West about three weeks
ago and who registered at the Pal
metto Hotel as from New York, was ar
rested to-day by order* of General Shaf
ter as a suspicious spy. Castellanos has
been watched for two weeks. He was
plentifully supplied with money. Cas
tellanos .wrote as many as 100 letters a
day, and this, together with the discov
ery that he was traveling under an as
sumed name, resulted in his arrest to
day. The case will be thoroughly in
vestigated.
Elaborate arrangements have been
made for the banquet to be held at the
Tampa Bay Hotel to-morrow in honor
of Queen Victoria's birthday. Covers
for about 250 guests will be laid.
Everything now waits on news from
the fleets. On the arrival to-day of
the Iroquois, Santiago and Cherokee,
twenty-one transports are now at tho
pÂ«rt, every one fitted ready for embark
ation. These ships will easily accom
modate between 15,000 and 1(5,000 men,
somewhat over the total number or
regular troops in camp here. It is
thought thirty-six hours after orders
are received to embark every man,
horse and pound of supplies can be
placed on board the vessels in waiting.
OBJECT TO THE SLOGAN
"REMEMBER THE MAINE."
BOSTON May 23.â At the opening of
the State Unitarian Association's anni
versary week a resolution addressed to
Secretary of the Navy John D. Long
was adopted, declaring that "As the os
tensible and only justifiable move for
entering upon the war with Spain was
the deliverance of a neighboring people
and ourselves from relations to them
that had become Intolerable, we wish
to express our -abhorrence of the spirit
of vengeance manifested in such a war
cry as 'Remember the Maine,' and beg
you to refuse to purchase goods of any
kind carrying this motto and in all
ways to discourage and discountenance
the use of this motto or any other cal
culated to foster the spirit of savagery
against which we are contending."
The resolution was signed by a ma
jority of those present. The same pe
tition was framed and accepted at a
meeting of the Women's Educational
and Industrial Union. Both petitions
have been forwarded to Secretary
Long.

PORT-AU-PRINCE, May 23.â 1 ha*ve just received information
from a reliable source in Port de Paix of fierce cannonading in Wind

NO HOPE FOR
ANNEXATION
Certain to Be Defeated
in the Senate.
TOO LATE FOR ACTION.
CANNOT BE BROUGHT TO A
VOTE.
Opponents of the Treaty Will Not
Agree to a Revival of the
Question in Any
Form.
Special Disratch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, May 23.
The question of the annexation of the
Hawaiian Islands has been revived in
the Senate to a certain extent since the
Hawaiian resolutions were reported in
the House, and the friends of annexa
tion have been quoted as expressing a
determination to press the House reso
lution in the Senate during the present
session in case it should pass the House
for fear that the short session would
not afford time to secure its thorough
consideration. The opponents of an
nexation declare they will not agree to
the revival of the question in any way
in the Senate before the adjournment of
this session, and some of the Demo
cratic opponents do not hesitate to say
that rather than have the Hawaiian
question reconsidered they will debate
the war revenue bill indefinitely. I
Senator White, who has been one of
the most persistent opponents of an
nexation, to-day gave the following j
outline of his position on the question:
"Before the present Congress as
sembled it was stated that the treaty
would be pressed immediately on the
opening of the session. This was not
done. On the contrary the matter was
not called up until we were well into
January. The debate was quite active
for a while; then the subject was
dropped because the friends of the
treaty were short of votes and It has
not since been revived in the Senate. If
any attempt is made, vow xhat the tini"
for adjournment ought to be near, to
reagitate annexation under the resolu
tion theory, the result cannot be favor
able to an early disposition of the Im
portant legislation pending in Congress,
but will keep Congress in session all
summer.
"The power to admit territory or de
pendencies by resolution is doubtful.
Texas came in by resolution, but was
admitted as a State under a provision
of the constitution expressly giving
Congress the right to admit new States.
This and many more equally cogent ar
guments will be elaborated whenever
this interesting matter phall be publicly
debated.
â¢'The sensible thing to do is to sus
pend further proceedings on the sub
ject of annexation until the war with
Spain is over and we face the new prob
lems resulting from our success at
arms."
SPANISH CRUISER FIRES

Alleged Mistake That May Involve

England.
ST. THOMAS, D. W. 1., May 23.â The
Spanish cruiser Isabel II while at San
Juan fired on the British steamer
Roth, which arrived at Porto Ilico af
ter the bombardment. It is alleged the
Spanish ship fired on the steamer,
which was loaded with coal, with thÂ«Â»
intention of crippling her and thereby
preventing her departure. The officers
of the Isabel 11, however, claim the fir
ing was thff result of an accident.
CHICAGO, May 23.â A special from

These officers express the opinion that
the order means the formation of a
brigade of siege artillery which will be

DELUSIVE CHEAPNESS.
A Poor Article of Any Sort Is Dear In
the Long Run.
Tallow dips are cheaper than electric
lights; but they ruin the vision and
what riches will replace a lost pair of
eyes? Flintlock muskets are cheaper
than magazine rifles, but are not placed
in the hands of our soldiers.
Beware of the storekeeper who op
poses your wish for a certain article
and sings the praises of something
cheaper. He is looking out for him
self, and if the lower-priced goods did
not put more money into his pocket
than the higher priced, he would not
be so anxious to sell them.
Many a druggist or grocer when
asked for a bottle of Duffy's Malt
Whiskey, will produce an imitation or
a substitute and tell yon that it is every
bit as good as Duffy's. He wilfully
misleads you; because he hopes to put
a few cents into his own pocket. Duffy's
Pure Malt Whiskey is sold at the low
est price consistent with the highest
standard of excellence. An imposing
array of disinterested testimony is evi
dence of Its value.
Who vouches for the swarm of Imi
tators? Who knows what has been
put Into the "cheap" substitutes that
certain greedy retailers would pour
down the throat? of the credulous?
Do not be imposed upon and do not
i triflo with your health. Get the gen-

Four American Vessels
Shocked by an Un

While Far Out at Sea They Are
Jarred From Stem to Stern
in a Peculiar Manner.
Copyrighted, 1898, by James Gordon Bennett.
KEY WEST, May 23.â Four Ameri
can ships, lying In a bunch, twenty-five
miles from land, yesterday afternoon
between 2 and 3 o'clock were shaken
from stern to stem by a mighty explo
sion, so mysterious that an earthquake
is the only explanation.
Of course, the sailors were thrown
from their feet, and every man on
every ship thought an explosion had
taken place directly under him. I am
not at liberty to mention the names of
the ships nor the location in which they
were when the phenomenon occurred.
News of it was brought by one of the
ships which arrived at Key West this
noon to take o-* coal.
The sea at the time of the mysterious
occurrence was as calm as a tropical
sky overhead. One of the ships that
felt it was steaming- in one direction
and sighted the three others. They ap
proached, and as they came within
speaking: distance all the engines were
stopped and an exchange of greeting
was begun. Suddenly came a report
that shook the heavens and knocked
fiat every man on deck. As soon as the
officers and men had regained their feet
those on the ships quickly gave their
attention to the other ships of the
fleet, expecting that their eyes would
witness a terrible calamity.
From one ship came a shout: "Was
that explosion aboard you?"
At nearly the same instant every
commanding officer, assured his own
ship was intact, made this same in
quiry of his neighbors. Men were sent
below on each ship as soon as matters
became slightly composed, to make an
examination of the magazines and
bottoms. Not a thing on any ship was

RICHES FROM THE DEAD.
MICHAEL WORMSER ESTATE TO
BE DIVIDED.
Eight Persons to Share Property in
Phoenix and Vicinity, Val
ued at a Half -Million
Dollars.
Sp<vlal Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, May 23.â Five members of
the Jacob family in San Francisco and
Tacoma have been notiiied that they
and three other; heirs living in the East
will have divided among them an es
tate valued at $500,000, left by Michael
Wormser at Phoenix, Ariz. The Pa
cific Coast heirs are Michael Jacob,
traveling agent for Carroll & Carroll,
â wholesale liquor dealers, and Sarah
Jacob, both of San Francisco; Joseph
and Meyer Jacob and Miss Florestine
Jacob of Tacoma. Charles Goldman of
Phoenix has been the administrator of
the Wormser estate, and Joseph Jacob
will leave this week for Phoenix to as
sist him in managing it.
Wormser died intestate, and under
the laws of Arizona the proceeds of his
estate will be shared equally by the
eight heirs. Wormser had never mar
ried and was 89 years old when he died
three weeks ago. He had remarkable
success, becoming one of the richest
men of Arizona through the cultivation
of an immense irrigated farm.
Going to Phoenix in 1875 he gradualjy
increased his holdings until he owned
9000 acres lying south of Salt River. He
tapped this river with an irrigation
canal twelve miles long, known locally
as San Francisco ditch, which watered
his ranch. He raised wheat, sugarcane
and fruit, but laid the basis of his for
tune by selling wheat at 5 cents a
pound in early days, before Arizona
was traversed by railroads. He em
ployed between 300 and 400 men. Re
cently hiR ranch was bonded to Eastern
men for $360 000. If the purchase is con
sumat^d this sum will be distributed
among the heirs at once. He owned a
large interest in the Tempe canal, i ne
ot the largest irrigation projects-, in Ari
zona, and several .years ago brougnt
about its enlargement from thirteen to
fifteen feet in width. He owned prop
erty at Phoenix and Prescott.
Meyer and Joseph Jacob, now en
gaged in the shoe business here, for
merely resided in San Francisco.
NO CLEARANCE
PAPERS FOR MANILA.
WASHINGTON, May 2.?.â Secretary
Gage to-day issued an order to cus
toms officers notifying them that the
port of Manila, Philippine Islands, is
blockaded by the United States fleet
under Admiral Dewey and therefore
clearance will not be granted to mer
chant vessels for that port. The in-
Btructions also warn owners and mas
ters of vessels that in undertaking voy
ages to Spanish por's not now block
aded they run risk of Interruption by
future blockades and military opera
tions.
Hardtmttth'B "Kob-I-Noor" lead pen
dl will outlast three others. Try it. â¢
out of place, and not as much as a
cartridge on one of them had been ex
ploded.
The first thought among the officers
was that the magazine had exploded,
and especial attention was directed
toward one of the vessels, which was
known to have a large quantity of
dynamite on board. When it became
certain no such accident had hap
pened, thoughts turned to a Spanish
mine. But the distance from land waa
so great as to preclude the possibility
of any such agent, while there was not
a craft of any description in sight ex
cept those in the group of American
vessels.
The surface of the water had not
been disturbed in the slightest degree
by the occurrence. The water was as
calm a second after the denned report
as it was before. I saw the captain of
a ship that returned to Key West, and
he said the explosion, or whatever it
was, was something that no theory
could account for. It might have been
an earthquake, he said, although an
earthquake would naturally disturb
the surface of the water to a consid
erable degree. It would have thrown
a column of water into the air. All
the captain could say was that not
a particle of damage was done to any
ship and that nobody could say what
had happened.
The most peculiar feature of the oc
currence was that every man thought
the explosion had been just beneath
where he was standing at the time. On
one ship two jackies, one of whom was
lying on an engine hatchway and the
other standing on the forecastle, had
a dispute about it, each declaring the
explosion had been directly under him.
Then, on the other vessels, shouting
back and forth comments of the mys
terious event, all declared the force
came from directly below them. The
sound was a single deafening detona
tion, and not a rumble.
WILL CONTROL
THE REVENUES
Scheme of Tariffs for
the Philippines.
TO COLLECT CUSTOM DUTIES.
PRESIDENT HAS AUTHORITY TO
SO DECREE.
Precedents in the Mexican War
Which Give Naval and Mili
tary Authorities Power
to Act.
Call Office, Rlggs House,
Washington, May 23.
In anticipation of the early occupa
tion of the Philippine Islands by the
military and naval forces of the United
States, the Treasury Department has
already begun the formulation of regu
lations and a scheme of customs tariffs
which will be collected by the military
authorities and turned into the treas
ury of the United States as a "military
contribution." That the President has
authority to collect the Philippine rev
enues under existing circumstances is
not a matter of doubt. It was several
times done during the last war with
Mexico, and the authority of the Gov
ernment in the premises was sustained
by decisions of the United States Su
preme Court.
The court, in a case which grew out
of the capture and occupation of San
Francisco and all the upper part of the
State of California by the United
States troops, held that the President,
under the constitution, as commander
in-chief of the army and navy, had a
right lo exercise the belligerent right of
a conqueror and to impose duties on
imports as a military contribution for
the support of the army. This was
the view held by the court in another
case, where it was aiso decided the
capture of Tampieo, Mexico, by the
United States forces, though sufficient
to cause it to be regarded by other na
tions as part of our territory, did not
make it in fact a part of the TJnited
States under our constitution and laws.
"It remained," said the court, "a for
eign country within the revenue laws
of the United States."
The tariff rates now being prepared
by the Treasury Department will ciose
ly follow the Spanish customs laws in
force in the Philippines. Just what
revenues they produce Is not known,
but the assumption is that inasmuch
as the home Government realized from
them last year approximately nine mil
lion doilars, the actual amount collected
was $18,000,000. The Government will
assume control of the revenues as soon
as the principal seaports are in our
possession, and will continue to control
them, at least until Congress takes spe
cific action in the case or until peacs
has been declared by the two coun
tries.
Ordered to Watch Coal Ships.
VANCOUVER, B. C., May 23.â The
local shipping registrar has received a
notice from Ottawa, pointing out that
an attempt may be made by agents of
Spain or the United States to purchase
Canadian coal-laden ships and send
them to sea for war purposes. The of
ficers must, therefore, report any such
suspicious movements and changes in
the registered ownership of any vessels.

Special Dispatch to The Catl.
LOS ANGELES, May 23.â At last the
Los Angeles City Water Company has
made a fair and open statement to the
City Council as to what It will do in the
matter of releasing its improvements to
the city's water distributing plant pre
paratory to municipal operation. The
communication is a lengthy one, and
contains many points which have never
before been admitted by the water
company. It is specific in the facts set
forth.
The communication opens with a de
claration of the entire willingness to
sell to the city. Then follows a twelve
page typewritten description of the
water company's franchise, easements,
rights of way and titles to lands, reser
voir sites, etc. The communication
says :
Properties claimed by the Crystal
Springs Land and AVater Company, in
cluding developed water, wo do not claim
are included within the property which
the city is to purchase and pay for under
the contract of July 22, 1868.
The conclusion Is as follows:
We have kept before the Council all
; the time the fact that, without regard to
i what is or is not included in the con
i tract of July 22. 1868, we are ready and
I willing to sell the whole property of all
I the companies to the city, if the city
i intends to carry out its plan of municipal
ownership of the water system; that the
whole property of all of the companies
will be available to the city, no matter
what plans it may have in view. If the
city ultimately acquires lands above the
j Crystal Springs tract and conducts it into
I the headwaters we believe that it is
j known to all that it will not obtain all
the water moving in that section of the
country, which we have designated as
San Fernando Basin. If the estimates
made by engineers on behalf of the city
| In the various trials which we have had,
j should prove correct, the city will not
| obtain at that point a sufficient supply
; of water to meet the demands existing
lat this moment. The developments made
by the Crystal Springs Land and Water
Company and Its conduits and system
i generally, would be needed by the city.
j and could be utilized from the beginning
i and at all times. These properties taken
I all together are, of course, of greater value
I to anybody than the various parts would
be separated from one another, and, wo
think, would be of greater value to the
city, if it finally decides upon municipal
ownership, than it would be to anybody
else.
We would suggest, finally, that we
should make an effort to agree upon a
price to be paid for whatever of this
property the city chooses to take, whether
it be that which is included In the Los
Angeles City "Water Company's contracts
or the whole. If we can agree upon a price
the companies, or either of them, will
agree to accept that price and the city
can proceed to raise the money to make
the purchase.
Attention is called to the fact that
the matter is one involving an expense
that is beyond the annual revenue of
the city. By law, therefore, the city
could not enter Into a binding agree
ment for the pun age of improvements
and properties until a bond election is
held. The company says:
Any scheme which the city has in view
of municipal ownership will require a
vastly greater sum of money than it will
to buy our entire plant at the valuation
that we ourselves would fix upon It and
be willing to take. We think, therefore,
it would be proper for the city to be
looking to the question of taking steps
to provide for payment.
Attention is called to the difficulties
of a legal bond issue in this State.
We say, finally, that we are prepared
to furnish you with all information and
data that are within our reach, and agree
with you on a price when you are ready
to make the payment or meet the award
of arbitrators: that we will, if we cannot
agree on ;< ;>rice. arbitrate the matter
with you in '.he manner provided by the
contract; that if the city desires we will
Bell the whole property of all the com
panies, If we can agree upon a price.
The communication created a sensa
tion. It was entirely unexpected. At
the afternoon session It was referred to
the Council committee on water supply.

RESERVE SQUADRON
FOR THE PHILIPPINES.
Copyrighted, SBM, by James Gorton Bennett.
VALENCIA, May 23.â An order to the reserve squadron to clear for
the Philippines is said to have been definitely issued to-day. The
ships composing it are by royal command, the battle-ship Pelayo, the
armored cruiser Carlos V, protected cruiser Alfonso XIII of 4826 tons
and the auxiliaries Patria, Rapido, Alfonso XII, Buenos Ayres, Antonio
Lopez and Ciudad de Cadiz, with the torpedo-boat destroyers Pro
serpina, Audaz and Osado. The technical difficulty of taking the war
ships on such a long voyage without coaling stations or a base of sup
plies is said to be met by the number of armed transports accompany
ing the fleet.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, May 23.
âSenior class day exercises were held
In the chapel to-day. The crowd being
too large for all to obtain accommo
dation within, it overflowed onto the
pavement without and the inner quad
beyond. The seniors wore radiant
faces, for the university council had
just finished its' sitting, and the fates
of most had been announced. Some,
on whom uncertainty seemed to prey,
were noticeably overjubilant.
Following is the list of graduates:

Several Citizens, Who Witnessed the
Act Interfere and Save
Her From Being
Injured.
Mrs. Shainwald, the wife of Herman
Shainwald, of tho firm of Shainwald.
Buckbee & Co., the well-known" real
estate agents, had an exciting encounter
with a supposed Insane woman at Sixth
and Howard streets yesterday morning.
Shortly before 9 o'clock Mrs. Shainwald
while walking along Sixth street was at
tacked by the woman, w~o was armed
with a knife.
"I am going to kill you," she declared
as she brandished the knife. "I want
your heart's blood."
At this juncture two citizens who wit
nessed the scene, seized the infuriated
â woman, and after a short struggle sue-

ceeded In disarming her.
Mrs. Shainwald was so overcome by the
Fudden attack that she almost fainted.
Several bystanders assisted her to a boot
black stand, whore she was allowed to oc- j
cupy a chair until she had partially re
covered. She then sumoned a hack, and
was taken to her apartments at the Colo- i
rial, corner of Pine and Jones .streets. She
la still suffering from nervous prostra
tion, although no serious results are
feared.
Last night Mr. Shainwald visited police
headquarters and invoked the aid of Chief
In arresting his wife's assailant. Ac- I
<v,rding to his story, his wife was walk-
Ing along Sixth street, when she noticed
the woman, who was dressed in black,
apparently scrutinizing her. She paid no
attention to her, and was continuing
along the street when her assailant ac- j

she brandished it in the air, and with an
oath threatened to draw, it across her j

out avail. Just as she was about to use
the knife several citizens seized her, but
unfortunately allowed her to â¢â¢scape.
Immediately after hearing Shainwald s
story Chief Lees sent two of his best men
to make an investigation. They visited
the scene of the attempted assault, but
failed to find anybody who could fur
nish them with a description of the
woman As Mrs. Shainwald is still suf
fering from the effects of the fright, the
detectives concluded not to question her
until this morning. Mr. Shainwald is
convinced that the woman is Insane.
I^ate last night a citizen who witnessed
the attempted assault said he notic-d the
woman walking down Howard street.
She was acting s-trangely. and he con
cluded that she was mentally unbalanced.
Approaching a little girl she attempted
to sfMze her, when the latter, evidently
fearing that she intended to Injure her,
ra jt was* only a few minutes later that
she attacked Mrs. Shainwald. and tried
to cut her with a knife she carried up
her sleeve. The police think they know
the woman, and every effort is being
made to apprehend her.
Will Fight the Charter.
A meeting of the Thirty-fourth Assem
bly Anti-Charter Club was held in Prog
ress Hall, 29 Valencia street, last night.
A resolution was passed pledging the
members to do all in their power to de
feat the new charter, and the points of
the charter were explained by Mr. Mch
ols. A committee consisting of John Con
niff. D. O'Rourke, Joseph Colburn, James
McCloskey and B. Carter was appointed
to draft a constitution and set of by
laws looking toward the organization of
a regular district club for the coming
campaign.
A Child Scalded.
Julian J. Bainett, the one-year-old son
of Mr. and Mrs. Hainett of 2247 Mission
street, was accidentally scalded by his
mother yesterday and died shortly after
from the shock. The mother was pre
paring the meal and upset a bowl
of soup over the little one's head.
Dr. Grazier was called in, but cou.'d do
nothing to stay the hand of death. A
certificate wu signed by Dr. Grazier and
countersigned by the <V>roner, so the
little one's body was not taken to the
Morgue.
Peter Darby's Death.
Peter Darby of Crescent City died last
Saturday morning while making tire voy
age to this city. He was one of the best
known ol'izr-ris of Del Norte County, was
universally esteemed and regarded as a
man of the strictest integrity. His large
estate goes to his granddaughter. Miss
Kugenie Wood of 557 Ellis street. Tho
deceased was 77 years of age. The funeral
will be from the residence of his grand
daughter.

It would be difficult to toll Just what
"Trie Poster" Is. It Isn't comic opera. It
isn't musical comedy. It's unlike any
thing that was ever seen or heard upon
land or seaâ stage land or stage sea, of
courseâ and yet Its novelty isn't all a de
light There's the shadow of a plot and
then the mad whirl of the poster artist's
dream; and that's a success, for anything
more like a nightmare In shapes and
colors than the stage at the end of the
second act has never been embodied.
There's much that's good in "The
Poster." quantities of fun, hits of all
kinds at all things, and an occasional good
song like "The Poster Maid ' and "The
Next Day." But the music isn't equal to
the libretto. It lacks melody and it
hasn't caught the spirit of the satirical
tr Of eS course, there 1 * too much in "The
Poster" as it is now. Its authors must
choose between the satire itself and its !
introduction. When '"The Poster" shall
be 1. -headed of that meaningless little j
preamble of talk among the models; j
when the artist shall sooner go about the
business of the eveningâ to dream his
poster dream; when some of those ex
cellently costumed ballets are sacrificed,
and when, as one of the authors ex
pressed it in his speech, they shall "chase
it along quicker," "The Poster" will be
worth seeing. There are many clever j
lines in the .play.
"Draw!" says the Man in Armor to his
degenerate relative, "Draw and defend ;
thyself!" .
"Alas! I cannot draw," responds An- j
gelo d'Aubert. "I am a poster artist."
The artist's appearance with his four
creations is a masu-rpiece of realized
poster art. On the Tivoli stage alone may i
one see a real live maiden with green j
hair, her orange-haired rival robed in
magenta, an embodied purple cow and all
the other color monstrosities the fad has j
perpetrated. It is impossible to overlook j
the amount of care that has been taken
with the costuming, the work that has
been spent on the production, the spirited
efforts of the Tivoli east, and the atten- |
tlon to detail that characterizes the per- |
formance. . j
The audience last night showered
flowers and applause upon the performers
and called enthusiastically for the i
author. Mr. Wilson, who is really only
half the author, appeared and declared
that Mr. Carpenter, the other half, was
hidden up in the topmost gallery.
You will not be content until you see j
"The Pester." It isn't "The First Born" '
of musical satires. It has faults apart j
from its length and the quantities of ;
things its authors have tried to do all at
once. But It's wildly original in scheme,
it's generous in its scope of entertain- j
mentâ too generous to be artisticâ and it 1
abounds in evidence that a brain is be- j
hind it; that it wasn't composed by a
patent stereotyped burlesquing ma
chine. MIRIAM MICIIELSON.

The "Passion Play" was produced at tho
Baldwin last night, this being the first repre

Its religious significance, this pictured play is
remarkable for the excellent massing of
crowds of human beingsâ the only really sat
isfactory views of multitudes presented upon
the stage; for the excellent showing of the
brilliant colon in copies of celebrated pic
ture* by the "Id masters; for the good music
that accompanies it, and for the good taste
and discrimination with which the little ex

At the California.
One of the lx>st first nights in point of at
tendance in many weeks was witnessed at the
California last evening, on the occasion of the
opening bow of Hopkins* Trans-Oceanic Star
Specialty Company, under the management of
Robert Fulgora. The house was crowded In all
parts, from dress circle to gallery, and It was
amused and in many instances delighted with
the performance.
The opening selections were by far the bet
ter, while the closing ones were good. The
house was tickled with John and Louisa Tlll's
Royal Marionettes, presenting the pantomime,
"Skeleton Dance, Bluebeard and Humpty-
Dumpty," with a side splitting clown and
a wonderful woman, whose sleeves, as they
fell off, turned into little girls. Vlnle de Witt
was encored again and apaln for her graceful
and spirited j-laying on the cornet, and when
Bhe concluded with patriotic airs Including
"Dixie" and "The Star Spangled Banner" the
house shook with handclapping.
Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Sidman appear in a de
lightfully artistic comedy sketch. Henry Kess
ler, the illustrator of songs, has a sweet tenor
voice, which he handles well in his metrical
stories. The comedy duo, Morton and Re

quaint sayings. Mr. Morton's rag-time words
b.fiiiK particularly Irresistible.

performance closes with the cinematograph,
the most enjoyable part of which is the lec

tyjHJ spieler. The performance will continue
during the week â with matinees on Wednesday
and Saturday.
At the Alcazar.
After an absence of seven years Lewis Morri
son was greeted by a San Francisco audience
last evening at the Alcazar. The reception
was the most flattering; that the tragedian
could have desired. Golden Gate Lodge of the
Order of Elks, of which he is a member, at
tended In a body and at the end of the second
act Harry Newhoft, the exalted ruler of the
lodge, mounted the stage and in a few well
chosen words bade the actor a hearty welcome
in the name of the lodge and the people of this
city. At tho same time he presented a most
beautiful floral offering, emblematic of the
order. Aside from this half a dozen elegant
lx)uquets were handed over the footlights. Mor
rison replied with feeling and said many pretty
things of the people of the city that first gave
him note in his profession. The welcome he
reo4 ivt-.l operated as fuel to a fire and he
carried rait the difficult role of Torick in the
pathetic play of "Yorick's Love." The play and
the actor need no commendation. Taken as a
whole tie w:is r.rily 9Uj.jÂ»,rtcO by the A lea tat r
Stock Company. One valuable addition to the
cast Is Miss Florence Roberts, who took the
trying part of the comedian's wife Alice. This
bright little lady came in for her share of the
applause. She had many personal friends in
the audience who knew her merit before she
went to the Eap for additional laurels. An
other strong support was Wallace Shaw, who
took the jiart of Heywood. the managei.
â \Y right Huntington as "Edmund" could make
that character far more effective by entering
a little more into the spirit of the character.
The remainder of the casl was up to the aver
age. Taken on the whole the critical cau have
a treat by witnessing "Yorick's Love."
At the Orpheum.
Laughter and patriotic enthusiasm bubbled
from the Orpheum's large audience last even
ing: at the least provocation. There was provo
cation in quantity, however, as the menu pre-
pared for the vaudeville-going public by the
management is ljeund to bring forth shouts of
approval from the most pessimistic theater
goer. Carroll Johnson, the old-time favorite,
resplendent In yellow togs and new songs, won
the audience completely. There were other
popular features in the entertainment. Al
Leech, whose excellent comedy work used to
exhilarate audiences in days gone by, gang
and danced as of yon, and was ably assisted
by Lottie Vincent and Mabel and Mollie Fuller
lii a laughable musical comedy skit, entitled
"Their First Lesson." Leech's parody on the
hundred and one songs that have been aung
In years past caught the house.
Ezra Kendall's original monologue was slow
In gaining the applause of the house, but
he gradually warmed up and the crowd could
not get enough. His allusions to Dewey and
other Americans created great enthusiasm. The
Vans did a funny comedy acrobatic turn, and
Colby and Way won much applause by their
act. As a ventriloquist the former proved
himself the equal of any heard in many sea
sons. Miss Way's doll danring caused wonder
and hearty applause. Harry AHlster's por
trayal of Grant. Sheridan, Sherman and Wash
ington aroused patriotic ardor, but when he
impersonated Dewey and Sampson, heroes In
the present war, the audience rose to Its feet
and yelled until hoarse. The hold-overs, the
Manhattan Comedy Four, Jerome and Hell and
Kerner's visions of art are as popular as ever.
At the Grand Opera-House.
"Mrs. Partingtin and Her Son Ike" attracted
to the Grand Opera House last night a large
audience, which was kept in hilarious enjoy
ment during the four acts of the amusing
farce. Jessie Norton, the singing soubrette, as
the saucy Ike, made quite a hit and her pinging
was greatly relished, particularly In the song,
"In the Harbor of Havana, Far Away." The
widow was represented by W. J. Ellerford, and
the part could not have been in better hands.
Maud Edna Hall. Julia Blanc. Fred J. Butler,
Mortimer Snow and other members of the stock
company sustained their parts well. Butler
sang two patriotic songs and created quite a
Bensatlon.
The Columbia.
Robert Mantell and his talented company
have won a warm corner in the hearts of the
theater going people of San Francisco. Last
night saw the opening of the fourth week of
the engagement and the house was as well
filled and as enthusiastic as on the first night.
The play was "A Secret Warrant," and In It
all the actors sustained their well earned repu
tation. Mr. Manti'll and Miss Roselle Knott
shared the honors and each had to respond to
a number of recalls.
"A Secret Warrant" will be repeated to
night "Monbars" will be played to-morrow
and Thursday nights and "The Face in the
Moonlight" will hold the boards the rest of the
week.
At the Chutes.
The afternoon and evening performances In
the Chutes' Froe Theater are unusually good
this week. Oro, Bell and Oro, in 'Tun In a
Chinese Laundry." present a sketch entirely
new and one that provokes vast quantities of
laughter from the usually large audiences;
Quazlna, the male "La Loie Fuller"; William
dÂ» Boe, the "upside down man"; May Ken
nedy, a singer and dancer; living pictures and
comedy without end complete the bill. The
animatoscope shows stirring war pictures and
the Zoo is full of Interesting animals.
In the Divorce Courts.
Sarah Ryan was granted a divorce from
her husband, Frank S. Ryan, by Judge
Hebbard yesterday on the ground of
I cruelty. A decree of divorce was granted
: Annie Potter from Frederick S. Potter
!on the ground of cruelty. The plaintiff
was allowed to resume her maiden name.
Hurley. Olevis Reeves was granted a di
vorce from Edward Reeves on the ground

MAY REMOVE
ANY OFFICIAL
AT HIS WILL
John T. Doyle Replies to Dr. Taylor on the New
Charter Mayor's Extraordinary
Powers.
The following open letter from John T. Doyle to The Call on the new
charter Mayor's extraordinary power of removal will show the utter helpless
ness of any official under the new instrument who may happen to incur the
displeasure or personal ill will of the new municipal Czar:
SAN FRANCISCO, May 23, 1898.
To the Editor of The San Francisco Callâ Sir: I request space for a
brief reply to Dr. Taylor's comments (published yesterday) on my letter re
garding the new charter.
Dr. Taylor informs us that the Mayor's power of removal Is confined, to
officers of his own appointment, and in support of this contention he quotes
the words of the instrument, "and any appointed officer may be removed by
the Mayor for cause," coupled with the suggestion that the words, "appointed
officer," mean an officer appointed by the Mayor. So that one who has been
appointed a police officer Is not an appointed officer. My reply is that if
that is what Dr. Taylor and his associates meant to say, they didn't say it.
A half-dozen apt words would fully express it. I fear that when the courts
come to expound the charter they may not take the precaution of sending
for some member of the convention to tell them its meaning, but will read
and construe it for themselves. Such has been the usual course hitherto,
and my learned friend will acknowledge the great inconvenience of calling
him into court for instruction every time a clause of the charter has to be
construed.
But, says the doctor, the Mayor cannot have the power of removal of
subordinates, because section 21 (page 142) gives the power to the head of
the department in which he is employed. Undoubtedly the head of the de
partment has power to remove a subordinate, and, in my opinion, should
have, as he is responsible for his acts. The trouble with the new charter
is that it confers the same power on two separate authoritiesâ the Mayor
and the head of the department.
And, again, the doctor quotes section 12 (page 131) to show that certain
subordinates may be removed, after charges tried before the Civil Service
Commission or a tribunal appointed by them, and the inference is repeated;
because they can be removed by the commission, they cannot by the Mayor.
But if that be a just inference, then neither can they be removed by the
head of the department to which they belong. So this contradictory argu
ment recalls Punch's showman. "On the one side," says he, "you behold a
Prime Minister abolishin' of the corn laws, and on the other side you behold
a Prime Minister abollshin' of hisself." "But," says the urchin who is
looking through the glass, "which is the Prime Minister?" "Whichever you
please, my little dear," says the other; "you pays your penny and you
takes your choice." It appears plainly enough that the charter has pro
vided more than one way for removing many such officers. We will pay
our penny and the Mayor will take his choice.
My objection to this power of arbitrary removal is not. however, based
merely on the number of persons to whom it extends, but on the fact that it
destroys the independence of the officers to whom it applies. Suppose it
then restricted to officers appointed by himself, as Dr. Taylor contends, it
reaches all those important departments to which he appoints, viz.: Three
members of the Board of Public Works, four School Directors, four Police
Commissioners, four Fire Commissioners, five members of the Board of
Health, five Election Commissioners, three Civil Service Commissioners and
five Park Commissioners. These thirty-three persons exercise the executive
power of the government of the eight great departments committeu to their
charge. They should be men of known character and capacity, fit for
high station. It is not denied that the Mayor has the absolute power of
dismissing one or all of them at his discretion. Like the Centurion in the
Testament, he can "say to one, 'Come,' and ho cometh, and to another,
'Go', and he goeth." Are we likely to get persons of this character spoken
of willing to accept office subject to capricious discharge like a dishonest
or dissipated servant? No; we will get none but lickspittles to whom the
salary is the inducement to accept abasement.
Want of time prevents me from following the doctor into a discussion
of the provisions for street openings, etc., further than to quote the words
of section 6 (page S3) wrth respect to it. The Supervisors, if they adopt the
improvement recommended, pass an ordinance providing for it, "and may
in sa!d ordinance prescribe such rules for the conduct of the Board of Pub
lic Works respecting the assessment and valuation to be made by said board
* â¢ â¢ In addition to and not inconsistent with the rules herein pre
scribed as to said Supervisors shall seem expedient." If that does not al
low them to make one law for Rome and another for Athens. I am mis
taken. Tours respectfully,

Conductor : I don't know how I would get along if it wasn't fof
Ripans Tabules. We men here on the road are
always in such a "hustle," and get so little timÂ«
to eat and have to swallow our food so quickly.
bo wonder we have dyspepsia. I know I suffered
with it for nearly two years before I got "onto"
the Tabules, and 1 was in misery all the time. I
constantly had pains in my stomach and chest, and
a dizzy feeling about my head. My bowels didn't
work regularly, and I felt " mean " all the time. I
saw Ripans Tabules advertised so much I bought
some, and after taking them for a month felt lika
a new man. I have a boy who was troubled with
Indigestion, and gave some to him. They proved
to be just what he needed.
CUKES DISEASE WITHOUT MEDICINE.
OTHER BELTS CAN BE HAD: SOME
very cheap and others very high, â¢ but If you
want the BEST you MUST have Dr. Pierce' a.
We could fill this whole newspaper with letters
received from people who have been cured by
Dr. Pierces Belt, but we won't do it: would
cost too much, and then we should have to
charge very high prices for the belts, like the
"quacks", do who put such big advertisements
in the papers. The following letter is like
hundreds of others which we now have on
hand. Read it carefully:

by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the Washington coast. When

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, May 23.â The level of prices of j
stocks was lifted another notch as a result of I
to-day's trading. The dealings were not large
and there was no general activity in the mar- I
ket.- That is to say, the volume of dealings ,
In the speculative favorites was not very large
and a number of important stocks were inact- j
ive. At the same time It was not noticeable
that a number of usually active shares were â¢
moved and this gave the market the appear
ance of a broadening tendency which a closer j
'analysis did not altogether confirm. There j
was a large number of individual transactions I
of the small dividend paying stocks, indicat- !
ing a demand from investment sources. Buy- ;
ing of this character is usually designed for i
permanent or long-time holding and always j
accompanies a plentiful supply of money. There i
was no evidence, however, of any widÂ»spread
general Interest in stocks and the speculative
public evidently prefers to wait for a definite
outcome to the naval maneuvers in West In
dian waters. There was a good market for
Americans in London and prices were well sus- !
tamed on a belief that Spain would shortly sue i
for peace. There was a coincident rise of a \
point or over in Spanish 4s in London and I
Paris. A- rumor that this was due to a pend
ing Franco-Spanish alliance did not hurt Amer
icans In London. London was also a buyer of
St. Paul here, and altogether was quite a factor '
in the strength of the New York market.
Northwest responded to Its excellent statement '
of April earnings with a rise of two points
and radiated strength through both the Van
derbilt and the Granger groups, with each
of which It was co-ordinate. Early in the day !
there was a further advance of over two points I
In Pullman. Traders realizing in the late deal- >
Ings caused a break of nearly four points in
Pullman and of 24- in Consolidated Gas. The ;
result was unsettled closing considerably below
the best !n some cases and with net gains as
â¢ rule only small.
Railroad bonds were narrow and Inactive
but prices were well held. Total sales $1 350 -
000.

price. Others were unchanged.

LONDON MARKET.
NEW TORK. May 23â The Evening Post's
London financial cablegram says: Further re
ceipts of gold and the rumored settlement of
t ne West African difficulty strengthened all
the stock markets here to-day. The rise was
also assisted by the strength of foreign
Bourses. There were no public dealings, how
ever, and the business to-day was principally
bears' covering. Americans were strong, D.
& R G. and St. Paul leading. It Is said that
the Intter may be scarce for delivery at the
settlement to begin to-morrow. There was a
further rise of 1 point In .Spanish 4s.

?**â  CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET. â¢
, CHICAGO, May 23. â Lower quotations from
Liverpool and bright sunshine at home started
the wheat bears all over the exchange into
j activity to-day with the accompaniment of
a break in prices. The bullishness that was
apparent in wheat Saturday had no trace- left
to-day. The country news on the whole was
of the most favorable character, not only as
to the promised heaviness of the yield, but also
the prospect of an early harvest. September
was so freely offered that it Bold at SS%c be
fore buyers appeared in any great number.
The relief from the selling pressure came from
the bidding up of July, which was quite easily
affected on account of the small open Interest
in it. It rose from $1 09% in %c Jumps between
every fresh transaction until It was up to
$1 14%, and the effect on September put the
latter to 89% c. While Leiter was apparently
giving good support to July, his brokers were â 
selling September freely. Every one feared a
demonstration in May and predictions were
made of a. rise to $2 for that month before the
end of the week. TKe news of a statistical
character was for the most part exceedingly
bearish. July started l@2c lower at $1 O9'^&
$1 10%. advanced to $1 14%, : then settled back
to $1 09%, and rallied to $1 11 bid at the close.
May ranged between $1 54@1 65 bid, the latter
figure being the closing price.
The improvement In the weather was the
most prominent of the Influences in the corn
pit. The close was %c lower for July.
The market for oats was tame, closing %@%c
lower.
Provisions shared In the weakness developed
in grain. The break In corn especially was an
Influence. Packers were sellers. The close
showed declines of 10@12%c.
The leading futures ranged as follows:

Rapidly Growing.

FOLLOWING THE EXAMPLE OF
THE PAST GENERATION.
Equipments Wi3l be Supplied to
the Men at One-Fourth
Their Cost in the
Market.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, May 23.
The Oakland Light Cavalry is rapidly
Increasing in membership and in a short
time will be fully equipped with accou
terments and horses. They received in
formation to-day from the Government
headquarters that the necessary' Baddies
and harness for the 'horses, which under
ordinary circumstances would cost $32,
will be supplied to the light cavalry for
one-quarter of this amount.
Walter Morosco has promised to supply
all of the cavalry with horses, and as
there are now nearly sixty members,
his obligation will not be slight.
The Government will supply part of the
equipment, and headquarters will be
opened at once. The men have enrolled
on the understanding that on an emer
gency call they will join the regular
army as individuals, although they will
make every effort to serve as a unit, if
possible. The company will practice daily
with their carbines and sabers, and as
most of the members have had some mil
itary experience the cavalry will soon be
in a state of efficiency.
Those enrolled up to the present time
are: Will D. Powers, Ben Woolner, Dave
Roscoe, Carl Wood, P. M. Walsh, Phil

The cavalry is organized on the same
principle as the celebrated Oakland
Guard, which came into existence in 1861
on the outbreak of the Rebellion. Many
?e who organized at that time have
1 away, while some are parents of
those now enlisted in the light cavalry.
Like the light cavalry, the old guard
represented the flower of Oakland's
young manhood of its day, and eventu
ally became Company C of the First In
fantry, and later Company A of the
Fifth.
SIBERIAN TRADE GROWING.
Six Vessels Left for the Amoor River
During the Past Month.
Fan Francisco's trade with Siberia is
growing by leaps and bounds. Last year
two or three vessels were sufficient to
carry all the freight that was offering,
while during- this last month or six weeks
the barkentines Addenda and J. M. Grif
leths, the barks Edward, May and Wilna
and the steamers Taifu and Ailsa Craig
have all left for the Amoor River. Their
cargoes mainly consisted of flour, salt,
lumber and general merchandise.
Meyer Kahn. an employe of Reis Bros.,
Butter street, was treated at the Harbor
Receiving Hospital yesterday for injuries
received on an elevator. Reis Bros.'
freight elevator opens onto the street, and
Kahn has been in the habit of ridingonthe
elevator and opening the doors as he went
up. Yesterday the doors were locked,
and as Kahn could not stop the elevator
he got a crushing that will keep him in
bed for a month. Doctors Deas and Dig
glns, who treated Kahn's wounds, say
that his escape from death was marvel-
ous.
The steamer Dirigo, which was built for
the Klondike trade, has gone into retire
ment In Oakland Creek to ay.-ait the be
ginning of the rush to the Yukon via St.
-Michael.
The schooner Wing and Wing had a
hard time of it on the way down the
coast. On the 20th inst. she was caught
in a heavy south-southeast gale, and her
rudder head was carried away. Jury
steering gear was rigged, and vrith it
the schooner was brought into port.
The California and Northwestern Trad-
Ing Company's new river steamer Clara
had a very successful trial trip last Sun
day. A barge to carry the Clara is now
being completed and when everything is
ready the Fteamer will be lifted bodily
onto the barge and secured there. Then
the steamer Samoa will tow both barge
and stern wheeler to the mouth of the
Yukon. There the Clara will be launched
and will tow the barge up the river to
Dawson.
Richard Morrlssey, a boiler maker at
the Rlsdon Iron Works, received injuries
yesterday, .while at work, which may end
fatally. An iron bar which should have
been removed from one of the machines
Btruck htm on the neck and back in
flicting severe lacerations and Internal in
juries. He was treated at the Harbor
Receiving Hospital, but was afterward re
moved to St. Mary's.
The City of Peking, with the troops
aboard, will be the center of attraction
to-morrow all sightseers. The steamer
Sunol will make hourly trips to and
around the troopship between the hours
of 10 a. m. and 2 p. m. to-day. The Sunol
is a very comfortable boat, and an outing
on her will be a very pleasant one.
LANDLOBD AND TENANT.
An Interesting Point Sprung in
Judge Low's Court in Mrs.
Jennie Kean's Case.
A novel plea was introduced by Attor
ney Gallagher in Judge Low's court yes
terday in the search warrant case of Mrs.
Jennie Kean for the possession of her per
sona! effects, which were being held by
Jesus Borboa, proprietor of the Spanish-
American Hotel, for non-payment of rent.
Mrs. Kean denies that she is due any
rent, but as she cannot produce her re
ceipts, which she alleges have been stolen
from her trunk, she has nothing to back
up her assertion. Attorney Gallagher
thereupon, after securing evidence to the
effect that no notice was posted up in the
rooms that non-payment of rent wouid
entitle the landlord to a lien on the ef
fects of the occupant, argued that the;
absence of such notice prevented Borboa
from laying claim to Mrs. Kean's effects
till her rent was paid. The plea was new
to the Judge, and as Gallagher promised
to submit authorities in support of his
argument the Judge continued the case
to enable him to produce his authorities.
The point is interesting to all hotei
keepers.
The fight between Mrs. Keen and Bor
boa is a bitter one. Me had her arrested
last week for assault with a deadly
weapon in chasing him with a hatchet
and Judge Low dismissed the case. Then
he had her arrested for malicious mis
chief for breaking in the panel of her
door with a hatchet because he put a
padlock on it to prevent her from remov
ing her effects, and that case has not
yet been decided. Mrs. Kean meantime
obtained a search warrant to recover her
effects, and they are now in the posses
sion of Property Clerk Moran.
St. Markus School Picnic.
The St. Markus Sunday school, in con
nection with St. Markus German school,
O'Farrell street, near Franklin, held its
annual picnic last Saturday, May 21, at
Shell Mound Park, Berkeley. In spite of
the inclemency of the weather about 200
pupils had gathered with their parents
and teachers. Under the direction of Rev.
J. Fuendeling and the assistance of the
principal of the German school. Karl
Henrich, as well as the teachers of the
Sunday school, the pupils spent the day
pleasantly in games. Those who attend
ed enjoyed the cool air while running
races, and the empty lunch baskets told
of the good appetite that prevailed among
the picnickers. Just before the rain set
in at 6:30 o'clock the party returned to tne
city.

THROWN FBOM HIS BTJGQY.
Attorney Cohen Dumps Ivy L. Bor
den Into the Road and
Breaks His Leg.
ALAMEDA, May 23.â Ivy L. Borden of
1501 Van Ness avenue, San Francisco,
superintendent of the Alameda Water
Works Company, was upset in his cart
on Broadway late this afternoon and had
one of his legs broken.
An eye-witness gives the following ac- ;
count of the affair: Borden was driving: j
down Broadway, near Eagle avenue, in
a light sulky with a young and spirited
horse, and driving by his side in a buggy
was Alfred 11. Cohen of Fruitvale, son \
of the late A. A. Cohen, the well-known i
attorney. . , , ,â .
The men were engaged in a spirited
conversation, which was carried on on
the part of Cohen in so loud a voice as
to attract attention. Finally Cohen re
quested Borden "to come out to one side
Und they would soon settle which was the
Itctter man." Burden returned some reply
which was not audible, and then Cohen
reined WÂ« horse toward Borden's.
The vehicles became entangled in such
I a wav that Borden was upset and his
1 leer was broken. An eye witness says
I Cohen was the aggressor.
"I am very sorry that Mr. Borden
! was injured/ said Mr. Cohen to-night
' when seen at his residence. "I feel that
it was all due to his own carelessness.
He nulled hin horse around in such a
manner that his buggy nearly upset mine
and threw me out. When he went over
my horse started and ran down the
street As soon as I could 1 stopped him,
and turning drove back to where Mr.
Borden was standing holding his
horse. I asked. 'Are you hurt, Mr. Bor T
den.' He replied. 'Yea, my leg is broken.'
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 24, 1898.
To tell the truth, I did not believe him,
, but said, 'Get into my buggy and I'll take
you home.' He called me a nameâ l don't
want it published â and declined to accept
' any aid. Two men came to his assistance,
! and an express wagon was standing near,
j so I thought he was all right and drove
| on home.
"I don't care to say what caused the
j trouble. We had had some words, but
â¢ that does not amount to anything. I cer-
I talnly am sorry that this affair is so
I serious."
Borden's broken leg was set at his
I residence late last night. He was unable
to be interviewed, but a member of the
family said: "It was an unfortunate
affair, and occurred during a dispute over
purely personal matters."

commission adjourned.
AN ENEMY'S FLAG.
Rules Under Which the United
States Can Employ It.
WASHINGTON May 23.â The dis
patches from Madrid, giving the sharp
debate In the Cortes over the alleged
flying of the Spanish flag by American
warships, created much comment In
naval circles. Spain's protest to the
powers that this use of the flag was
"cowardly and iniquitous" was dis
missed by naval officers with the state
ment that international law writers
agreed on the right to use an enemy's
flag for purposes of deceit, so long as
the flag Is taken down before a shot is
fired. The United States naval regu
lations make specific provision on this
point. The Navy Department recently
issued an editian of Snow's Naval Pre
cedence, a standard work on naval
usage in time of peace and war. In
this the doctrine of the use of the
enemy's flag is stated as follows:
"The regulations cf the United States
navy state that the use of a foreign
flag to deceive an enemy is permissi
ble, but that it must be hauled down
before a gun is fired, and under no cir
cumstances is an action to be com
menced or an engagement fo-ught with
out the display of the national en
sign."
The foregoing rule, both by regula
tion and by the textbooks distributed
to the navy, is a guide for all naval
officers. Practically, the same rule is
applied to the use of an enemy's uni
form.
The statement made b* the Spanish
Minister of the Interior That the Gov
ernment is likely to resort to privateer
ing' does not cause any apprehension
among officials here. One of the high
est authorities of the Navy Department
said Spain would adopt privateering if
she felt it to be to her interest, with
out waiting for this country to give
any pretext for such action. It is felt,
however, that Great Britain. Germany
and France will have considerable to
say in case Spain resorts to privateer
ing. The commerce of these countries
with the United States would suffer
very severely by Spanish privateering,
ard its effect would be far more dis
astrous to these foreign interests than
to the shipping of the United States.
It was this influence of Great Britain,
Germany and France which forced
Spain reluctantly to forego privateer
ing^and it is not thought probable the
foreign influences will now consent to
have their commerce destroyed.
M. ZOLA'S SECOND
TRIAL COMMENCES
Proceeding's at Once Checked by an
Appeal to the Court of
Cassation.
VERSAILLES, May 23.-The second
trial of ML Emile Zola on the charge of
criminal libel, based on the charges
which he broMght against the officers
who conducted the Esterhazy courtmar
tial, commenced in the Assizes Court
here. But few of the general public were
admitted within the precincts of the
court, and rigorous measures were adopt
ed to preserve order. There was no ex
citement on the arrival of the ac
cused.
t M. Labori, counsel for M. Zola, imme
diately questioned the competency of the
court on the ground that the alleged of
fense was committed in Paris, and that
only a Parisian Jury was competent to
try the case.
The'- Procureur-General Bertrand of
the Paris court, who acts as Public Pro
secutor, upheld the 'competency of the
court. He said to M. Labori: "You de
sire to prolong matters, but we intend
to end the case. Be assured that the
country has had enough â do you hear? â
of this perilous agitation."
The court then upheld its competency
to try the case, whereupon M. Labori
announced that he appealed to the Court
of Cassation upon that point.
The trial was then adjourned, pending
the hearing of the appeal. On leaving
the court M. Zola was greeted with erica
of "Down with Zola!" intermingled with
cheers for him and cheers for the army.
RUMORS OF A FRANCO
SPANISH ALLIANCE.
Advance in Spanish Fours Due to a
London Stock Exchange Ro
mance.
LONDON, May 23.â The St James
Gazette this afternoon, in its financial
article, said: In the foreign market
> this morning several leading dealers
: were said to be in possession of ad
vance news of the forthcrrming: an
; nouncement of a Franco-Spanish alli
ance, hence the rise in Spanish 4's. In
! connction with the above, it is cur-
I rently reported that the recent speeches
â  of the Marquis of Salisbury and Jos
| eph Chamberlain did not refer to "West
i Africa, but to this impending alliance,
against which Mr. Chamberlain's allu
sion to an Anglo-American alliance
! was intended as a counter blast.
The strength of silver is attributed
to the prospective purchases to replace
the withdrawals from the Bank of
Spain, amounting to 130,000,000 pesetas
since April 16.

THE CONTRACT
UNWELCOME
|So Says the Journal of
Commerce Manager.
MUST PRINT THE TAX LIST.
HIS BID WAS LOWEST, THOUGH
.IT WAS NOT GUARANTEED.
A Turn Down for the Occidental
Athletic Club â More About
the Boulevard â Camp
bell's Successor.
The Journal of Commerce will have to
do the printing of the delinquent tax list
whether it wants to or not, unless some
thing intervenes to save it. The Journal
of Commerce waa one of the bidders on
the contract, its bid being 7 cents a name
for poll tax, personal property tax and
real estate, or 21 cents for a name under
the three heads. The bid was low enough,
but before the contract was awarded it
was sought to withdraw the bid on the
ground that the recent fire in Francis,
Valentine & Co.'s printing-house had de
stroyed the means by which the Journal
hoped to carry out the contract.
The next bid above that of the Journal
was the Report's, which was 40 cents a
name. Then came the Post's offer, which
was 43 cents a name. The list must be out
by June 5, and so it was imperative that
the contract should be let, and in view
of these facts the committee recommend
ed that the Report's bid be accepted.
The Board of Supervisors thought dlf- |
ferently, however, and yesterday decided j
that the Journal of Commerce could not ;
withdraw its bid and that it could make
other arrangements besides the one with
Francis, Valentine & Co., and* although
there is no check up to guarantee the ful
fillment of the Journal's contract, still,
the Supervisors are going to hold the
paper to its bid, and will, if possible,
OOflipel it to perform its agreement.
The Occidental Club was another one to
feel the adverse power of the board. It !
wanted a permit for an athletic exhibition :
to be given this month, but the permit
ml denied, although almost with the
same breath permits were granted to the \
National Club for June or July, the Cali
fornia Club and the Manhattan Club. The ;
| Occidental is Herget's club, and Herget
I made the trouble that nearly brought two
of the Supervisors to grief before the ,
Grand Jury.
The change of the name of the boule- i
yard from Balboa to Dewey came up
again under Clinton's motion to recon
sider the vote of last week making the
i change. There were several native sons
i present to protest against the taking
away of the name they had given, but
1 their protests were unavailing. Later
j Clinton tried to bring the matter up
> again by a resolution providing for the
"great -highway" along the ocean the
name of Balboa, but Devany moved to
substitute the name of Lincoln, and then :
| Clinton withdrew his resolution and sub
j sided.
The veto of the Mayor on a bill for $1400
for sewer work on the main sewer south
of the park was sustained by the board
by a close vote. The Mayor believed the
bill to be exorbitant. A veto on the ordi
nance requiring paperhangers to scrape
clean all walls before papering or paint
ing them was also sustained. It was
' found to be a matter for regulation by â 
| the Health Department.
A resolution awarding the contract for
lighting public buildings to the Pacific
Gas and Improvement Company for $1 oO
! per thousand cubic feet was passed, after
j objection by Clinton, who thought the
' rate too high.
Haskins submitted a resolution provid
ing for the immediate consideration of a
1 successor for the late Police Judge Camp
bell but it was decided to postpone the
; matter until the next meeting of the ;
"janes & O'Donnell were retained to col- ;
1 lect all money due from the State to the i
! city during 1898 for the maintenance of ;
indigents. They will receive 30 per cent ;
of the amount obtained.

SUICIDE OF AN ATTORNEY.
JAMES C. CARY, Despondent Through Sickness,
Kills Himself.
James C. Cary. a well-known and respected attorney of this city, committed
suicide some time last Sunday night by shooting himself through the head with
a revolver. The deceased resided at 930 Chestnut street with his sons. He had
been afflicted for the past two years with an incurable disease, and for that
period of time had been confined to his room. He was 73 years old, and the dis
ease and the knowledge that there was no hope of a cure at his advanced
age made him despondent, but his family had no suspicion that he intended to
do away with himse'.f.
Yesterday morning his son Walter, who is employed as a draughtsman at the
Union Iron Works, went into his father's room, as was his habit, to inquire
as to his wants, and found the deceased covered with blood with a revolver
clutched in his right hand. There was no note of any kind in the room.
James H. Cary, attorney at law In the Parrott building, is another son of
the deceased.

GLADSTONE'S WISHES
WILL BE OBSERVED.
Funeral of the Statesman to Be Con-
ducted in the Simplest Possible
Manner.
LONDON. May 24.â In accordance with
the wishes of Mr. Gladstone and the fam
ily, expressed in Mr. Herbert Gladstone's
letter to Lord Salisbury accepting a. pub
lic funeral, the ceremony will be the
simplest possible. There will be no state
pageant or flowers; only mourning dress
will be worn, and the chief feature will
be the representative gathering in West
minster Abbey of all classes and insti
tutions In the kingdom.
The Prince of Wales and the Duke of
York will ho amontr the pall-bearers. The
Duke of Connaught, the Duke of Cam
bridge Â«nd Prince Christian of Schleswlg-
Holstein-Bonderburg will precede the
coffin. Political associations will not be
represented; but the members of Parlia
ment will attend in a procession, headed
by the Speaker of thf Hjvise <>f Com
mons, the Right Hon. William * Court
Gully.
At a meeting of the members of the
American Colony, held last evening at
the Holborn restaurant, it was decided
to send expressions of sympathy to Mrs.
Gladstone. The suggestion was made that
the United States should erect a monu
ment, each State of the Union contribut
ing a block of stone for the base. A com
mittee was formed under the chairman
ship of Dr. Conwell to take further steps
in carrying out the suggestion.
THIS SEASON'S OUTPUT
OF KLONDIKE GOLD
Latest Arrival From Da\?son Esti
mates It at From Twenty-Five
to Thirty Million Dollars.
VANCOUVER, B. C. May 23.â E. W.
Mutch of this city arrived yesterday
from Dawson. Speaking of the gold out
put of the Klondike, he said it would
this year be between $25,000,000 and $30,000,
000. This opinion was given after a per
sonal inspection of the mines. When
shown Sam Wall's article in The Call on
the output from various mints, he said
that in almost every respect it was simi
lar to the conclusions arrived at by him
self. All the gold, he says, will come out
if banking arrangements are made so as
to provide proper currency.
At Lake Bennett. Mutch lamed that T.
Barnes of Astral, Kans., and Louis
Blshaw of Montana were drowned by the
ice giving way on the lake. He says there
is absolutely no truth in the rumor of
"Swiftwater Bill's" death. He saw a man
who met Gates and his party less than
a fortnight ago. They were making good
progress to the Interior.
LIVELY SCRAMBLE
AT AN EVICTION.
MONGOLIANS CARRY AWAY A
FRIEND'S PROPERTY.
Queue Pullings and Fights Over the
Chattels of an Unfortunate
Merchant.
Spofford alley presented a lively scene
yesterday afternoon when deputy sheriffs
Berved an attachment and order of evic
tion on Goy Sing, a gxoer-r, ronducting a
store at No. 14. The merchant himself,
"was not present, but his Mongolian
brothers took possession of his goods as
soon as they were put into the street and
numerous fights resulted from the desire
of each man to secure as much of the
booty as he could get away with.
The eviction was the outcome of a suit
filed by Heloine Chamberlain, the owner
of the building, to collect $45 rent due.
Deputy Sheriff Jesse Galland with eight
assistants and an attachment for an iron
safe and contents and an order of evic
tion presented himself at the store early
in the afternoon and found the pro
prietor away and the store locked. They
tyad the lock picked and immediately be
gan the work of removing the goods. A
large crowd gathered in the alley and as
Boon as any of the absent merchant's
chattels were placed on the sidewalk they
were grabbed by the eager Mongolians
who hovered about the place like birds
of prey. When two would get hold of the
same article a lively tussle would ensue
and often tlie rival claimants would in
dulge in queue pulling. Before the of
ficers had removed the safe from the
store every bit of the luckless merchant's
stock had disappeared as mysteriously as
if it had been swallowed up by an earth
quake. The deputies even had to keep a
strong guard around the heavy safe to
prevent Its being carried off by the crowd
of hungry fortune hunters.
Care of -the Insane.
City and County Attorney Creswell
has sent an opinion to the Supervisors
regarding a bill presented by the State
to the city for $14,112 50 for care for the
insane, in which the city's refusal to pay
is sustained. Mr. Creswell advises that
the only time the city can bo made to
pay is when the patient is under indict
ment while awaiting trial either for crime
or as to his sanity and when he has been
regularly committed to the asylum by
the proper authorities. These cases are
all provided for by the Penal Code. All
other cases are under the Political Code
and must be cared for by the State.

HERMITS MINE
IN THE CITY
Two Men Have Shafts
Dug Near Ingleside.
MANY YEARS AT THE WORK.
ILLNESS BROUGHT TO LIGHT
THEIR EXISTENCE.
Pathetic Adieu to the Home of an
Old Man When Taken to tha
Hospital.
Officers from the City and County Hos
pital were astonished, yesterday after
noon, by the discovery of a mining camj
In active operation within the city limits
A call was received at the hospital foi
an ambulance to take a sick man frorr
his home near Ingleside. Dr. Giarinini
Frank Johnson and Joseph Wagner went
with the ambulance, and found that thÂ«
sick man was Nelson H. Shoots, and that
his home was a little hut in a forest ol
eucalyptus trees, and that he and a part
ner were engaged in mining, having three
shafts 100 feet deep.
Shoots has been sick for the last six
weeks from heart trouble, and has had
no medical aid but the little home treat
ment given him by his partner, James
Demott, who has lived with him for
nearly sixteen years. Thp sick miner is
71 years old, and the doctors found that
he was In a very serious condition, and
immediately decided on moving him to
the hospital, thinking his life might be
prolonged for a coiyile of months If given
good care. The old man made no ob
jection when informed of the physicians'
intentions, but seemed to realize that the
race was nearly run and that he was
leaving his little hut to return no more.
As he was placed on the stretcher and
carried out through the trees he raised
his head for one last l"ok at the place
which had sheltered him for so long, and
with tears in his eyes murmured: "Good
by. old home, good-by. It is hard to leave
you. dear old home."
The old man has lived In California
many years. He came to the State In
early times, made considerable money and
was well-to-do. Some twenty-fivg years
ago, while prospecting, he foiind pay dirt
in some black sand near the place he now
lives, and claims that he took 57000 In dust
from it. This firni !ei! him to stake out
a claim which he has held until th<
ent time. The tra<-t of land was formerly
owned by the French Bank, but later
became the property of Adolph Sutro,
who owns it now.
The fact that Shoots stuck tn the claim
so long leads to the belief that he must
have made it pay. hut he and Demott
claim that they have lost $40,000 in the
venture. One of their lossrs was to the
Spring Valley Water Company. Three
yean npn they dug a tunnel 900 feet long
in their prospecting, and in digging they
struck a pipe of the water company,
breaking it and flooding the place with
water. The two men were sued by the
company and the court awarded a judg
ment of $SCOO against them, which they
paid.
As snon as Shoots was safely in charge
of the doctors. Demott returned to thÂ«?
mmp. and while both men claim they are
almost destitute it is the belief that they
have considerable money hidden away.
There is a larpe quantity of ore piled
about the place, and Demott claims that
it is valuable. He says that if he had a
good mill considerable money could be
ground out of the rocks.
Demott is a comparatively young man.
beinpr about 40 years of age. Tie and
Shoots have lived as hermits, never see
ing any one except when it was necessary
to buy food, and then finishing their
business and returning to their hut as
soon as nossible. When safely tucked In
bed at the hospital Shoots made Inquiry
nf nr.o of the attendants if the United
States was really at war. and if so. with
Id that he had heard it
rumored that there was a war, but did
not believe the report true.
It is doubtful if Shoots will live very
long. a<= he is very weak. The doctors
think the chance of surroundings may
cause him to rally for a time, but three
rnontbs is the limit they place on his
life. He came here originally from Ken
tucky. whÂ«re he wr.s born, and he is said
to have been married twice.
ARMED FOR BATTLE.
Customs Officers Present Cap
tain T. J. McCreagh With

Thirty-five assistant weighers of the
surveyor's department of the United
States customs service at 6 o'clock
last evening went to the steamer
City of Peking on board the revenue
cutter Hartley, and presented Captain T.
J. McCreagh of Company D with a beau
tiful sword. The captain, who was in thÂ©
Government service as an assistant
weigher, resigned his position in order
that he might go with his company to

with his fellow-workers in the service,
and th<=y took occasion, on the eve of his

TRANSFER OF THE TROOPS.
Genera! Otis Will Establish Headquar=
ters at Camp Richmond.
An order issued yesterday by General Merriam, commanding the De
partment of California, transferring all the troops now here with the ex
ception of the Third Artillery, Fourth Cavalry and the First "Washington
Volunteers to General Otis' command is of special significance, and is the
preliminary step in the thorough organization of the forces destined for
the Philippines.
General Otis and his staff are now actively engaged in arranging for the
work, and within a day or two his headquarters will be moved from the
Phelan building to Camp Richmond. The general and his staff will go into
camp with the troops, living under canvas with the others, and his first
work will he the organization of the troops into brigades. The first bri
gade has already been formed, and comprises the First California, Second
Oregon, Fourteenth Infantry and detachment of artillery under General
Anderson, detailed for the advance of the expedition.
This work completed. General Otis will take personal command of the
division and have the officers and men thoroughly instructed in their
duties. The general is of the opinion that there will be little or no oppor
tunty for drill after reaching Manila before the troops are called upon for
the severer duties of the campaign, and he fully recognizes the necessity of
familiarizing them with the brigade and division movements. Many of the
volunteer officers have never handled their men in more than company and
battalion formation, so that they have much to learn yet.
During the interim before the second detachment is sent to Manila
there is plenty of work in store for officers and men, and General Otis be
lieves it will be best done with him on the ground. For that reason he will
remain close in camp until General Merritt arrives.
Following is the order transferring the troops:

TROOPS TO ARRIVE
The Crack Pennsylvania Regi
ment Due Here This
Afternoon.
According to advices received by the
Southern Pacific Company the Penn
sylvania volunteers with 602 men and
thirty-eight officers left Ogden early yes
terday morning in two trains, which are
il raising siowly along and will arrive
hero some time this afternoon. The rail
road company seems to account for only
two battalions of the Pennsylvania regi
ment.
The Montana regiment leaves Butte
early this morning and is scheduled to
leave Ogden Wednesday morning and get
here Thursday evening.
The T'tah troop of cavalry leaves Salt
Lake City this morning to arrive here to
morrow evening.
L'es Only on Display.
Throughout the parade It was notice
able that the police force of the city did
little toward preserving order and keep-
Ing the eager throngs from Interfering
with the march. This was In no way 'the
fault of the policemen, but of their leader,
who seems to have thought more of the
opportunity to make a display of himself
and his men than to discharge the duties
for which policemen are paid.
Again and again the officers In the vari
ous companies had to tight their way
along. The police preceded the soldiers,
and as soon as they had passed the
crowds became mobs, the order that ex
isted while the police were in sight be
came anarchy and the confusion every
where was inexcusable.
It is time that the Chief of Police began
to understand that he is' not paid
to make ;i display of himself nn every oc
casion, but is hired to preserve order
among other things on occasions of the
character of the grand event of yester
day. To say that the force utterly failed
is to put it mildly. It stands to reason
that a band of men engaged in parading
cannot keep back crowds of citizens who
press onward eajrej . ;:â  â¢> t-neit vm....
the movements of the soldiers.
A Grievous Disappointment.
To the Editor of the San Francisco ;
Callâ Sir: The Examiner stated yester- ]
day morning that the troops would pass :
down Second street on their way to the
Mail dock to take passage on the Peking
for Manila. As a result, the merchants
on Second street decorated their stores
and many thousand people gathered on j
the street to see the soldiers pass; but
another example of yellow journalism ,
was brought forcibly to their notice when
they saw that the troops had passed
down Third street. It was certainly a j
great disappointment to these people, and
especially so to the many women and
children 'who lost this oportunity to show
their patriotism by assisting in cheering
on to the front our brave boys in blue.
ONE OF THE DISAPPOINTED.
San Francisco, May 23, 18JÂ«.

"ILLNESS OF J. V. COLEMAN.
The Capitalist's Relatives Are Sum
moned to His Bedside.
The friends of J. V. Coleman are very j
much alarmed over his illness. During j
; the past two weeks he has been seriously
ill at his home, 2837 Jackson street. In !
; this city. Indeed, so critical a stage had
the millionaire's condition reached that -
i his absent relatives were hastily sum- j
moned to his bedside, and are now hur- ;
rying to San Francisco.
They are: Mrs. Harry May of "Washing- j
ton, D. C, who is expected to arrive to- j
day or to-morrow; and her sister, the
Countess Dauginey, whose home is In ,
i Paris, who likewise has been called to
the bedside of Mr. Coleman, and will
! probably arrive some time during the
latter part of the week.
Dr. Buckley, his attending physician,
has iziven it out that the patient is in a
critical condition. For over six months;
past Mr. Coleman has been far from !
being a well man. Some time ago he went i
to Europe for his health, but gained little i
benefit. His return to California was of |
comparatively recent date. While out i
camping he contracted a severe cold, that
aggravated his long-standing complaint ;
and gave rise to various complications, â 
which now threaten his life.

SAD FATE OF
A COMIC
JUGGLER
William Fielding in a
Padded Cell.
A VICTIM OF STRONG DRINK.
MUST CANCEL ENGAGEMENT AT
THE ORPHEUM.
The Doctors at the Receiving Hospi
tal Believe That His Mind Is
Almost Gone.
George H. Fielding, the "comic juggler"
who recently did a turn at the Orpheum,
is locked up in a padded cell in the Re
ceiving Hospital. Yesterday afternoon
he staggered into the hospital and asked
to be treated.
"I am up against it," he remarked.
"John Barleycorn has succeeded in floor
ing me like he did poor old John L. Sulli
van."
After being given a dose of medicine j
the clever Juggler was placed in a padded j
cell, as it is believed that his mind is de- j
ranged through the excessive use of
liquor.
Fielding arrived here about ten days
ago to fill an engagement at the Or- j
pheum. He made a big hit the first night
ne appeared at the theater, and was at i
once signed to perform at the various ]
theaters comprising the Orpheuiti clr
cult. The following day he got drunk, ;
and as he was unable to appear the man- j
ager of the Orpheum canceled his en- ;
gagement and advised him to return to
nis home in the East. Since then Field
ing has been on a debauch, and finding
himself in a serious condition he con- j
eluded to visit the hospital in search of j
medical assistance. As he sat in his cell I
last night he imagined that he was on the !
stage, delighting a vast audience with his
clever tricks.
Juggling with some imaginary objects,
he would toss them in the air and appear
to catch them as they fell.
When one of the attendants would peer
into his cell he would a.sk him what he !
thought of the tricks, and beg to give !
him a "boost" in the newspapers.
"I am the greatest living juggler," he
would declare. "Barnum first discovered
me and introduced me to the great Amer- j
lean public. My rivals in the business are
jealous of me, and have conspired to get I
me out of the way." â¢Â»"
The doctors at the hospital believe that
Fielding's mind is gone. Unless his
mental condition is improved they expect. |
to be compelled to place a charge of in
sanity against him. Fielding has a heist
of friends in the Bast, who will sincerely ,
mourn his sad condition.
NOT A PARTY FIGHT.
All Citizens Advised to Oppose the
New Charter.
P. J. Reynolds presided last Saturday
night in Bunce's Hall at a meeting of
the Forty-third District Central Silver
Club. After a number of those present
had expressed themselves In opposition to
the proposed charter the following pre
amble and resolution were unanimously
adopted:
Whereas, Section 2 of article XII of the
proposed new charter requires the Board of
Supervisors to determine the kind of. lawful
money in which municipal bonds shall be made
payable; and
Whereas. This provision in effect means and
can mean only that municipal bonds under
the new charter would be payable in gold, thus
establishing in this city the creditorr's option
perpetuating the gold standard and tending
to render difficult, if not impracticable the
restoration of. bimetallism, violating the letter
and spirit of the National Democratic Popu
list and Silver Republican platforms;' there
fore
Resolved. That it is the duty of all Demo
crats, Populists and Republicans? who are sin
cere in their political pretensions to vote
against the proposed new charter at the spe
cial election, and we hereby censure and con
demn ail such a? are now engaged In the at
tempt to tolst on the people an instrument
which departs bo radically from the recent
trachlnfis and profeasiona of political parties

Olsen in Contempt.
The writ of habeas corpus recently is
sued out in the Superior Court by J. B.
Olsen to escape a short term of imprison
ment imposed upon him by Justice of the
Peace Cook was dismissed yesterday by
Judge Carroll Cook of the Superior Court
Olsen was sued a short time ago by an
artist for the price of a picture he had
painted for the defendant, and notwith
standing the order of court. Olsen refused
to respond to an order of examination. In
consequence Judge Cook found him guilty
of contempt and committed him to jail for
twenty-four hours. Now that the writ
has been dismissed Olsen must either go
to jail or purge himself of contempt.

ADVERTISEMENTS.
DRY THIN
AND
FALLING HAIR
The purest, sweetest, and most effectiYe*
treatment is warm shampoos with
followed by light dressing* with Cuticura,
purest of emollient skin cures. This treat-
ment will clear the scalp and hair cf
crusts, scales, and dandruff, allay itching, i
soothe irritation, heal eruptions, destroy
microscopic insects which feed on the
hair, stimulate the hair follicles and sup-
ply the roots with nourishment and en-
ergy, thus producing a clean, wholesome
scalp, with luxuriant, lustrous hair.
Bad Scalp Humor Cured
I had a bad scalp humor, and thought 1
. would go frantic with â¢itching. I lost consid-
e rable of my hair (of which I had an abun-
dance, and was very proud). I tried several
remedies but they all proved a failure. I tried
CtmcoÃA Soap, found relief Immediately,
and that itching Is completelygone.
Mrs. M. JTDAX,
Feb. 20, 1898. 246 HalHday St., Jersey City.
Falling Hair Restored
I was troubled with dandruff so that it made
my hair fall out so bad I pot discouraged. I
purchased a box of Ccticdra (ointment) and
a cake of Cdticdra Soap. The former I
rubbed well into the scalp twice a week, and
then shampooed with warm water and a good
lather of Cuticctba Soap once a week. I
, am pleased to say that â â  my hair is growing
out thick once more, and free from dandruff.

CHARGED HER
WITH MURDER
Mrs, Gregory as Hugh
Williams' Slayer.
RESULT OF THE INQUEST.
EVIDENCE AGREEING WITH THE
WOMAN'S STORY.
Nevertheless the Jury Recommends
That Her Husband Be Dis
missed.
The Coroner's jury In the case of Hugh
Webster Williams rendered the following
verdict last night:
''We, the jury, do find that the
name of deceased was Hugh Webster
Williams, a native of England, aged
about 55 years, and that he came to
his death in a milk wagon on his way
from 2019 Eagle avenue to the police
station, Alameda, at about 11 o'clock
a. m. May 22, 1898, and that death
was caused by internal hemorrhage
produced by a bullet wound inflicted
by Mrs. Abbie M. Gregory at 2019
Eagle avenue, Alameda, and we do
recommend that William M. Gregory
be held as accessory to the murder of
Hugh Webster Williams."
The following jury had been impaneled
by Deputy Coroner Fowler for the
purpose of holding the Inquest on the
body of Williams, who was shot to death
in Alameda Sunday: J. R. Bigler, J. D.
Judd, J. B. Vosburgh, J. A. Riley, E. J.
Bevan, J. A. Munro, F. P. Fury. J. D.
Judd acted as foreman.
The first witness called at the Inquest
last night was Mrs. Gregory. She told
of her acquaintance with Williams, as
: already related, and of his history and
: occupation.'" Nothing was asked her about
: the affair of the shooting or what led up
to it.
Officer Lawrence testified to having
been directed by Gregory to the house on
Eagle avenue. He went there and found
Mrs. Gregory at the door. She had blood
on her fa.cc and clothing. There was a
man lying on the kitchen floor alive and
with his pulse beating. They removed
the man to a milk wagon which they
had brought with them, but he died on
the way to the Morgue and the body was
taken there. Lawrence took Gregory to
jail and went back after Mrs. Gregory
and put her under arrest.
Sergeant Conrad testified to Gregory
calling at the police station with blood
on his face and clothes. He said he had j
a fight with a man on Eagle avenue, and j
that his antagonist was in a pretty bad
way. He said the man had forced his j
way into a house and abused a woman
and child, and he had had a row with
him. He said the man was knocked out
and was drunk. Later the officer sent to
the house returned and said that the man
was dead. Conrad went and examined
the house and found evidence of a severe
struggle.
Victnrine Courtois, the nurse employed I
by Mrs. Gregory, testified that she had '
been in the house since the 4th inst. Had i
only seen Gregory twice, the first time j
about two weeks ago. Had seen Williams
before and had not let him in the house
because Mrs. Gregory was not at home.
On Sunday he came to the back door.
Mrs. Gregory told her not to let him in. |
He said he wanted to see the child. She
tried to keep him out. but he pushed his j
way in and went into the room where ,
Mrs. Gregory, Mr. Gregory and the child i
were. She heard no noise of talking or j

scuffling: as she was !n the kitchen at the
time. After a while she heard the boy
cry and went In. The boy was standing
close to the bed. Gregory and Williams
were standing up fighting. She saw Mrs
Gregory holding the pistol, and .Mrs
Gregory told her she had shot Williams
She heard the shot while she was in the
kitchen. Subsequently, in reply to a
question, witness said she did not see the
pistol in Mrs. Gregory's hand.
Mrs. Gregory told her she had Phot
Williams to defend her husband. Gregory
dragged Williams out of the bed into the
kitchen. Mrs. Gregory's hands and face
had blood on them. The pistol was shown
witness, and she identified it as the one
that she saw every morning under the
pillow. Mrs. Gregory had spoken about
AVitllams to her several times, and said
he had bothered her all the time. While
Williams was lying in the kitchen he did
not say anything. Mrs. Gregory had
called to her, and said, "Help me, for Wil
liams is going to kill my husband." At
the time she saw them fighting Gregory
had nothing in his hands.
Myrtle street, corner of Fourteenth
Dr. Keys described the wounds in the
man's head, and said he thought they
were caused by the pistol. Dr. Buteau
testified that in his opinion the man
might have lived several hours with such
a wound or might have died instantly.
Levi Siemmens and James Fowler gave
important testimony, and Mrs. Gregory
testified that the letter found on Wil
liams' body was in his handwriting.
Gregory was in attendance with coun
sel, but was not called as a witness, nor
did his attorney take any p*rt in the pro
ceedings.
There were several developments of in
terest yesterday in the tragedy. Gregory
refused to say anything ;'.bout the affair
until after he had consulted his attorney,
and Attorney H. H. Davis of San Fran
cisco, for whom he had sent, did not
present himself during the day.
Mrs. Gregory, on the other hand, was
not at all reticent and was perfectly will
ing to talk about the affair. When told
that her husband said that it was he and
not she who fired the shot she contradict
ed him and said that he was mistaken.
She got hold of the pistol first and fired
it, but as Williams kept on fighting with
Gregory she did not think she had hit
him. After she fired at Williams and
dropped the pistol her husband picked it
up and beat Williams over the head with
it for some time, and he might have
thought that he fired it off, but she says
he did not. He was so excited and Wil
liams was fighting so desperately that
Gregory might easily have thought that
he (Gregory) shot him. Mrs. Gregory went
over all the details of the affair again to
day and told substantially the same story
as yesterday, not varying In any im
portant point.
She went into Williams' history to a
greater extent than before and "showed
an Intimate knowledge of his operations
and schemes for raising money by means
of his inventions. She said that he had
obtained a considerable amount from J.
H. Lounge of this city, but Lounge found
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 24, 1898.
A DEADLY PARALLEL OF
FIGURES THAT CANNOT LIE.
There will Be an Absolute Loss to the Teachers of the City anu
County of 14 Per Cent From Their Present Salaries Should
the Proposed Charter Become a Law.
x It is claimed by the advocates of the new charter that it will cause no changes in the salaries vi school
teachers and no changes in the moneys to be used for school purposes. Figures may be juggled to suit purposes,
but the plain presentation of official figures admits of no juggling. Below is given a table which shows in the deadly
parallel the exact financial condition of the School Department should the new charter become the constitutional law
of this city and county.
These figures may be relied upon as being absolutely and officially correct, and can be verified from the following
extracts from the charter as it has been framed and as it is now presented to the voters of the City and County of San
Francisco:
Article VII, Chapter 111, Section 9, provides as follows: "For this purpose (payment of salaries) the Audi
tor shall annually segregate so much of the common school fund as shall not exceed twenty-eight dollars for each
pupil in average daily attendance in the public schools in the City and County during the preceding fiscal year."
Under the proposed charter all salaries must be paid out of this sum, including superintendents, four deputy
superintendents, four School Directors, secretary of the Board of Education, clerks, messengers, attaches, census mar
shals, janitors and teachers.
Article XVI, Section 33. reads as follows: "No deputy, clerk or employe of the City and County shall be paid
for a greater time than that covered by his actual service."
The natural deduction to be reached from the above quoted paragraphs from the new charter and the following
table, is that upon the teachers of the city and county will fall the burden of a loss of the sum of $139,252 each year, to
be taken bodily from their present salaries or to be deducted through payment only for actual time spent in the school
room. To be convinced of this it is only necessary to read and study the following table:
Under
Present Act.
Revenue.
Expense.
Appropriation for
1897-98 $1,080,000
Teachers' salaries $996,000
Janitors' salaries 55,500
Office salaries 9,990
Shop salaries 7,230
Board of Exam-
iners 400
Census 7,000
Incidental sala-
ries, lawyers,etc 2,000
â
Total $1,078,120
It will be seen by the above table that there will be a deficit of $101,752.
This added to $37,500â the sum necessary to provide for the care of 1500 new
pupils, which is the estimated increase for the ensuing yearâ makes a total of
$139,252 to be deducted from the salaries of the teachers, leaving $856,748 to
be paid to teachers, or 14 per cent less than they are at present receiving.
that he was not reliable and so dropped
him He also discovered that \% illiams
had' been in an insane asylum in New
York and had been discharged cured
Mrs. Gregory says that V\ illiams often
boasted to her of his strength and said
that he could crush any man s hand with
his grip. He had bragged that he could
kill a man with one blow of his fist. He
had made so many boasts and threats
that she was afraid of her life and used
often to lock the door and pretend no one
was at home when she saw him coming.
The following letter was written to Mrs.
Gregory by Williajns about May 1:
Abhie- Are you willing that disagreeable

planation without heat or passion on eltner

The Oakland Tribune says:
Webster H. Williams, the victim of the
tragedy, met a fate which those who
knew him some time ago felt would
eventually overtake him. In him were
united the elements which characterize
what are known as "high rollers," who.
by hook or crook, succeed in having a
good time and who seem to revel in the
company of women.
The episode of yesterday brought Wil
liams unexpectedly to the attention of his
acquaintances after a mysterious disap
pearance of nearly a couple of years.
Williams' last scene of operations prior
to his violent death was in San Leandro,
in this county. He made his appearance
there about the time specified, when the
Town Council of the place was engaged
in a violent warfare with Landers, the
leading light of the gas company of the
place. Â .; ;:f
"Williams made his appearance, stated
that he was an Englishman of high de
gree, and tried to prove this by consum
ing champagne in liberal quantities, giv
ing swell dinners and basking in the smile
of female company from various parts of
the State. It is claimed he had a scheme
for making gas oy means of which the
Illuminant could be produced at the mini
mum of cost. He finally took hold of the
San Leandro gas works and induced-sev
eral other people to go into the scheme
with him.' Williams collected the money
and allowed material hills to run unsatis
fied He was the principal projector also
in the California Free Payment Gas Me
ter, through which, by depositing coin of
various denominations, a consumer could
buy as much gas as he was disposed to
pay for. The scheme fizzled. Landers got
back his gas works. Williams' associates
were fleeced and Williams himself
skipped. ____^ ___

THEY FOUGHT
FOR GLORY
Boxing Night at the
Manhattan Club.
A HOT FIGHT STOPPED.
M. EGAN KNOCKED OUT BY
TYE OF OAKLAND.
Rings That Are Without Padded
Floors Are Considered Danger
ous by the Police.
If Tom Sharkey and big Jim Jeffries
had been turned loose in the ring of the
Manhattan Athletic Club last evening
they would not have pleased the; mem
bers half as well as the boys who ham
mered and smashed each other for the
love of the sport. Apart from the pre
liminaries, which consisted of light box
ing and wrestling, the spectators wit
nessed two rattling contests between
well-known boxers.
The first event, which gave every
promise of being interesting, was to have
been an eight-round bout between Willie
Cole of the Manhattan Club and Chick
Finnerty of the Olympic Club. Al Wiggln
was selected referee.
The instant word was given to the
lightweights to set the ball rolling. Cole
plunged at his opponent, and it was
hammer and tongs all through the round,
much to the delight of the lovers of the
game, who cheered the contestants when
the gong sounded for the end of the open
ing engagement.
In the second round Chick made some
terrible efforts to finish his game quickly,
but he found Cole to be a harder nut to
crack than he expected, and as tho round
was drawing to a close Chick was re
treating under a hot hre from Cole's right
and left defenders.
Cole had decided to lead in the early
part of the third round, but Chi<^k ap
parently caught his second wind and
during the last minute of the round some
heavy blows were landed at close range,
honors being about evenly divided.
The fourth round was particularly In
teresting. The boxers met at close range
and it was give and take until Chick
landed a hard left awing on Cole's Jaw,
which sent the receiver to the boards. On
regaining his pins Cole attempted to get
out of harm's way, but instead of avoid
ing the enemy he ran Into an uppercut
which dazed him. As he was in the act
of falling he clinched with Chick and then
the police interfered. The referee called
the contest a draw.
It was learned subsequently that the
police interfered because the floor was not
padded properly and the officer in charge
was afraid that a heavy fall on the hard
boards might result in a fractured skull.
Doubtless all clubs giving boxing con
tests in the future will be compelled by
the authorities to provide proper padding j
on the ring lloor.
The last event of the evening was an
eight-round contest betwen M. Egan of
the Manhattan Club and Charles Tye of
the Reliance Club.
Egan was the better boxer, but -what
Tye lacked in science of the game he
made up for in ability to take punish
ment. The Reliance Club man was ap
parently as strong as a horse, and he
simply wore his opponent out.
Egan had much the best of the first
round. In the second honors were about
equal. In the third Egan scored quite
a lead, putting hard swinging lefts into
Tye's stomach and countering on the jaw.
In a sharp rally Egan received an upper
cut over the right eye which left a pro
nounced impression.
Egan had the best of the early part of
the fifth round, but weakened toward the
finish, allowing Tye to get home some
hot tooth disturbers.
The sixth was evenly contested, both
men retiring with bellows to mend.
In the seventh Egan was showing strong
signs of weakness, and a hard right hand
punch In the stomach seemed to knock
considerable play out of him, but he
fought gamely until near the end of the
round, when he ran his jaw into a hot
swinging right, which sent him to the
boards. He remained down for eight sec
onds. but scarcely had he regained his
pins when Tye planted a second swing on
the Jaw, and Egan fell fiat on the boards,
where he was counted out.
CONDEMNS THE CHARTER.
The United Labor Party Will Oppose
the Projected Measure.
A brief but important and spirlted^es
sion of the board of control of the United
Labor party was held last evening at
their headquarters on Clay street, near
Montgomery.
Chairman William P. Grace presided,
and in opening the meeting stated that
It had been called for the purpose of de
fining the attitude of the party upon the
question of the adoption of the new char
ter.
Mr. Grace criticized the instrument at
length, pointing out the enormous power
and patronage confered on the Mayor
without any authority to remove or in
any way control him, and declaring that
under it tyranny, oppression and plunder
would prevail, while the citizens would
be powerless and unable to help them
selves.
The sentiment of the meeting as ex
pressed by all the speakers was that the
whole trend and tendency of the pro
posed law was toward the centralization
of power In the hands of the few, as
against the Interests of the many.
The following, resolution was adopted
as the sense of the meeting.
"Resolved. That we, the United Labor
party of the City and County of San
Francisco, believing the effort for the
adoption of the new charter to be an at
tempt upon the part of officeholders and
would-be officeholders to assume uncon
stitutional authority, to subvert the will
of the people to their own personal in
terests, and for the retention of them
selves and their personal and political
friends in office, hereby declare that we
are oppose] to the adoption of said char
ter by the City and County of San Fran
cisco, and we call upon all those who
labor with their hands to join us in our
attempts to defeat so iniquitous a meas
ure. By order of the Board of Control.

CAUGHT IN THE ROOM.
Arrest of Michael Fay, a Laborer, on
a Charge of Burglary.
Michael Fay, a laborer, was arrested
last night by Policeman T. P. Riordan
and charged with burglary.
Shortly after 7 o'clock Fay visited the
Orlando House at Sixth and Howard
streets and entered the room occupied by
Timothy Lynch. The latter was asleep
at the time, but was awakened by the
noise of the intruder.
The latter on being discovered ran along
the hallway and sought to escape by hid
ing at the foot of a blind stairway. Rior
dan was summoned and after a short
search discovered the burglar. When
searched at the City Prison a purse con
taining $1 50 and several souvenirs which
he had stolen from Lynch's pantaloons
were found in his possession.
Charged With Bobbery.
William Cornwall, a laborer, last night
caused the arrest of Calisto Ortiz, a boot
black, on a charge of robbery. Tester
day afternoon Cornwall met Ortiz and in
vited him to his room at 313 Fourth street

robbed him of a silver watch and $12 in
money.
Divorce Suit Filed.

A BLOW
TO HIGHER
EDUCATION
New Charter Dooms
the High Schools.
AN INSUFFICIENT REVENUE.
BIG BOND ISSUE THE ONLY AP
PARENT REMEDY.
Lack of Funds Due Either to the Ig
norance or Stupidity of the
Framers of the Law.
Should the proposed charter be
adopted the high schools of San Fran
cisco -will be so seriously crippled that
they may have to go out o-f existence
unless a bond issue is made to insure
their support. As the issuance of bonds
for any specific purpose is a matter
of the greatest moment it goes with
out saying that many of the educa
tional advantages now within reach of
the youth of this city will pass out of
existence at the moment the new char
ter becomes a fundamental law.
In the opinion of every one who has
given a thought to the subject no
greater calamity could befall the city.
The end and aim of the public school
system would be defeated, and all be
cause the framers of the charter, eith
er on account erf ignorance or stupidity,
failed to make adequate provision for
the support of the school system as it
now exists.
The funds necessary for the support
of the public schools of San Francisco
are at present acquired under the pro
visions of section 76 of the consolida
tion act, which reads as follows:
"The school fund of said city and
county shall consist of all moneys re-
ceived from the State school fund; all
money arising from taxes on property
which shall be levied each year for
that use by the Board of Supervisors,
and which shall in no case exceed the
rate of 35 cents on each hundred dol
lars valuation of all property, real or
personal, liable to be assessed."
According to the last assessment the
taxable valuation of all real and per
sonal property in this city was $345,
000.000. At the rate of 3. r Â» cents on each
hundred dollars this would bring a
revenue of $1,207,000. This amount, add
ed to the sum received from the State,
$638,000, makes a total of $1,845,500, the
amount that was available for the sup
port of the schools of this city for the
year 1897. Recent reports show that
even this great sum was Inadequate to
the needs of the schools as they are
now maintained.
Under the proposed charter the
money necessary for the support of the
schools is to be secured by the follow
ing provision:
"A school tax may be levied, 'which
added to the revenue derived from
other sources (the State) shall produce
an amount of money which shall not
exceed $32 50 for each pupil in attend
ance during the preceding fiscal year,
as ascertained and reported by the
Board of Education.' "
The average attendance In the schools
of San Francisco for the year 1597 wa3
35,500. At the rate of $32 50 for each
pupil this attendance would produce a
revenue of $1,088,750, according to the
provisions of the new charter. This
would leave a deficit of $756,750, which
sum could only be made up by a bond
issue.
It is a self-evident fact that if the
proposed charter is adopted the youth
of this and coming generations in this
city must be content with a common
school education, unless succeeding
Boards of Supervisors can be induced
to bond the city for the money that will
be necessary to maintain the high
schools. In other words, the adoption
of the proposed charter will be a step
backward in the march of civilization.
FIVE VACANT CHAIRS.
Seven Pines Circle Holds an Impres-
sive Memorial Service.
The hall of Seven Pines Circle, Ladles
of the G. A. R., in the Native Sons' build-
ing was packed last evening with ladies
and gentlemen present to witness the
memorial service of that organization.
The hall was tastefully decorated with
flowers and the American colors. In front
of the president's station there were five
vacant chairs, on each of which were
twined garlands of evergreen. These rep
resented the chairs that were occupied by
Laura C. Brewer, Margaret C. True, Lou
isa Cramm, Josephine A. Mawson and
Jane Mehlwitz, members of the c"ircle,
who passed away during the year.
Mrs. Ayers, the president, read the
service of the order, and there were re
sponses by the other officers, after which
Mrs. Powers read the order for Memorial
day. Miss Amanda Corcoran sang
"America," Miss M. Griffiths recited a
selection appropriate to the occasion,
Mrs. Ruth Gorton gave selections on the
violin, Mrs. J. Murray Bailey read an

Company G has won the medal on two
successive occasions, but as it is neces
sary to win it. three times before it be

The defendant in the action, John A. San

learned that an endeavor would be made
to prove that he hypnotized his aged wife,
a woman of 70 years. The contestants,
daughters of the testatrix, do not allege
that Sandell is a hypnotist, but simply
claim that he took advantage of his

Opposed the Charter.
At the meeting of the American branch.
Socialist Labor party, on Sunday after
noon the merits and defects of the new
charter were freely discussed. G. B.
Benham was the first speaker, but while
he found enough defects to make a
lengthy speech, the merits were few and
far between. He cited the provisions to
amend the instrument as simply a bait
to catch unwary voters, as he said that
the State constitution renders such action
