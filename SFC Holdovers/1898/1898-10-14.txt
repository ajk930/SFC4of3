Fourteen Deaths Is the
Record of the Collision
at Virden.
Another Attempt to Bring in Ne
groes Frustrated by Governor
Tanner's Orders.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VIRDEN, 111., Oct. 13. â The day passed without another out
break of violence, but, aside from the restraining influence of the
militia, no progress has been made toward permanent peace.
The idle miners were excitable and determined, while the Chi
cago-Virden Coal Company has shown no sign of a purpose to
abandon its plan of operating its mines with imported negroes.
Yesterday's shooting has resulted in
fourteen deaths so far, as follows:

Olive.

A meeting of the executive committee

Chairman John Belgar asserted

The matter was discussed and a de
cision made to employ counsel and lay
the matter before the Grand Jury.
The union miners this afternoon re
ceived tluir semi-weekly allowance of
52 from the union. .
The excitement of yesterday, prior to
tho arrival of the negro train, was
equaled to-night when it became
known that a special train consisting
of one box car, three apparently empty
coaches and a caboose that passed
through here at G:25 o'clock this even-
Ins bore two carloads of negroes, taken
through here to Springfield yesterday.
The train went south, and through a
clever ruse succeeded in passing
through Vlrden quietly and without
Interference. A big crowd of miners
v.a.s at the station, but the militia held
them in check.
When the train*stopped at the stock
ade Captain Fevier, who was in com
mand, then shouted: "Don't allow any
one to disembark from that train!"
The gate was opened and a file of sol
diers rushed out on the double-quick
â¢with fixed bayonets and lined up along
side of the train. General Manager
Lukens made a formal request that
their employes be allowed to land and
enter th<i stockade. Captain Fevier de
clined to grant this. Then Manager
Loikens put it in the form of a demand,
but the officer replied that he was un
der orders from Governor Tanner to
prevent the disembarking of any negro
miners at the works, and that he would
have to carry out these instructions.
General Manager Lukens protested In
vain and the train pulled out, headed
Bouth.
By this time the advance guard of
strikers, gathered at the depot, had ad
The San Francisco Call
.l up the track to within 100 yards
of the stockade. The presence of armed
bluecoats in the lookout boxes evi
dently halted them, as they remained
there until the train passed, when they
greeted it with waving hats and cheers
for Governor Tanner, who, they be
lieved, had been instrumental in start
ing the blacks on their homeward jour
ney.
After the departure of the train Mr.
Lukens made this statement:
"When the special train carrying the
blacks arrived this afternoon at the
mine the troops, v - der orders from
Governor Tanner, refused to let them
get off the train, and they were com
pelled to go through.
"I protested to- the captain in com
mand of the guard at the mine at this
action and told him there was no law,
except the law of force, that would
justify this action. He replied that he
had strict orders from Governor Tan
ner not to permit the blacks to land,
and that he was compelled to follow
instructions."
While martial law has not yet been
declared, the town is virtually under j
control of the State troops, under Cap- j
tain Craig of Battery B, First Illinois
Artillery.
Upon the arrival of the soldiers from
Pana two Gatllng guns were taken to
the public square, where they com
mand the business section. Guards
were thrown out, and the remainder of
the soldiers were quartered in the opera
house.
Two hundred miners, who have been
sleeping in the Miners' Union Hall for
several weeks, were somewhat sur- |
prised on coming from their quarters j
at daybreak to find soldiers on picket |
duty at the door. Each man was met !
with "'Hold up your hands," and the re
quest was good-naturedly assented to.
Each man was thoroughly but fruit
lessly searched for firearms. Among
the crowd were several negroes, and
from outward appearances there appa
rently existed the best of feeling be
tween the white and black union
miners.
"General" Bradley, leader of a dele
gation of sixty miners from Mount
Olive, returned home to-day with the
remains of the dead Mount Olive
miners.
"I think this has been one of the
most infernal outrages ever perpetrated
on a laboring public," he said. "Our
men were shot down like dogs. They
had orders to talk the matter over with I
the mine people when it came to a
crisis and not to shoot unless fired up
on. Instead of arbitrating the question
I leave for home with a baggage car
full of dead men.
"I do not expect any further trouble
in Virden for the present, but I cannot
answer for the future, for there is a
day coming when the laboring man will
be given bread instead of bullets."
There is a feelir- among the people
of the town not connected with the
mines that the Virden miners are not
responsible for yesterday's tragedy.
One citizen declared that all the trouble
had been caused by outsiders who came
here and incited the local strikers to
acts of violence. A fact that bears out
this statement is the circumstance that
in yesterday's bloody work not a single
Virden miner was killed, and those hurt
were only slightly injured.
J. F. Eyster, superintendent of the
Climax Trading Company, the estab
lishment controlled by the Chicago-Vir
den Coal Company, who was so severe
ly beaten in the scrimmage, has im
proved slightly.
This afternoon all the arms and am
munition of the Chic.ago-Virden Coal
Company were confiscated by Captain
Fervier, commanding the State militia.
There are 125 Springfield rifles and 2500
rounds of ammunition.
FIGHTING STARTED BY
A MINER'S SIGNAL
ST. LOUIS, Oct. 13.â A special to the
Post-Dispatch from Virden, 111., says:
M. Turner, one of the guards stationed
in* the yards south of the town to an
nounce the approach of the train carry
ing the negroes, says he fired the first
shots yesterday as a signal to the main
body of miners near the depot. The
miners had agreed, he says, that ten
shots in rapid succession should be the
signal that the train was approaching.
Turner says he flred in the air, and the
men on the train answered with a vol
ley Into the crowd, whereupon the firing
became general.

PREPARING TO SUPPRESS
FURTHER OUTBREAK
"WASHINGTON, Oct. 13.â Secretary
Alger sent the following dispatch to
Governor Tanner of Illinois:
"In the event that the National Guard
of the State proves insufficient to cope
with the difficulty of protecting life and
property and maintaining order in your

RIGHT TRIUMPH IN
THE WILLIAMS CASE.
Last Chapter in the Local History of the Notorious South
African flillionaire Mine Owner and Adventurer.
The Call Rests Its Case.
The ends of justice have been served, so The Call now writes "finis" to the last chapter of
the noted Charles A. Williams case. The desire which actuated the expose of the adventurer
was to protect an innocent girl from the clutches of a villain and to rid society of an offensive
member. Persecution played no part in it.
Although the charges were of the most sensational character, every effort was made to
present the facts clearly and concisely, and not to pander to morbid curiosity. The paper has
in its possession much more damaging evidence against Mr. Williams than it has presented.
The information contained a mass of matter of an offensive character. Only such was used as
proved absolutely necessary to substantiate the charges originally preferred by this paper.
All possible tact and delicacy were used in an endeavor not to link the name of the im
postor with the names of those who, unfortunately, had come into close social contact with
him, admitting him to their homes and entertaining him with the lavish hospitality for which
Californians are noted. The unmasking of this adventurer was a slow and a difficult process,
necessitating the gathering of evidence from all parts of the world.
The information withheld would have tended to make him despised of all men, but the
object of this paper was not to blast character but to subserve the ends of justice. Should
the time come when the evidence will be necessary to again protect society, it will be forth
coming. It recounts every crime in the calendar with the exception of murder, and shows
the hideous depths to which this outcast of society descended.
Hereafter families of standing will be loth to accept as sponsors for strangers within
the city's gates any men except those of known probity and honor. The lines will be drawn
more sharply, to prevent a recurrence of the Williams episode. An explanation seems due
from the social backer of this man, who made possible the plying" of his nefarious trade
in this city.
What plans Williams may have for the future does not concern this journal. It but
echoes the sentiment of this community in expressing the hope that he shake the dust of this
city from his feet.
SANTA FE RAILROAD IS SOON
TO REACH SAN FRANCISCO
This Important Admission Has Been Made
by an Official of the
Company.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TOPEKA, Kans., Oct. 12.â The To
peka State Journal to-night prints the
following: The Santa Fe will soon
reach San Francisco, and the road will
have through connections from Chicago
direct to the Pacific Coast. President
E. P. Ripley is in California conferring
with capitalists, with a view of secur
ing the Bakersfield road, which will
give the Santa Fe a direct line up the
valley to San Francisco.
This fact is gleaned from an inter
view with C. M. Higginson, assistant to
President Ripley. "While Higginson did
not say so directly, yet two or three
guarded admissions to a Journal re
porter gave sufficient color to warrant
the above statement. This will make
this great system independent of the
Southern Pacific road, to which the
Santa Fe is now more or less indebted
for its entrance to the commercial mart
of California and to which road heavy
rentasre is daily paid.
That the Santa Fe system has long
been making efforts to become inde
pendent of the Southern Pacific system
in securing a through line to the Pa
cific Coast none familiar with the his
tory of the road doubts.
Now that this move Is about to be
come an accomplished fact friends of
the read offer congratulations. No man
stands closer to President Ripley than
C. M. Higginson, his assistant. Higgin
son was in Topeka yesterday in his pri
vate car. With him were his wife and
daughter. The two latter will be left
at Las Vegas by Higginson, who is on
his way to join Ripley in California.
When questioned as to the object of
his trip and if it had any special signi
ficance Higginson stated that he expect
ed to meet Ripley, who was at present
in California, on an important mission,
but that his object was to confer with
the president of the road.
Asked if President Ripley was not in
California with the purpose of securing
possession of the Bakersfield line or de
vising means to effect an entrance to
San Francisco independent of the
Southern Pacific, Higginson stmply
smiled and remarked that the Santa Fe
people were very desirous of such a
state of affairs and. hoped to bring
about its conclusion at an early date.
He then thoughtfully added:
"Of course I do not know Mr. Ripley's
mission in California, but suppose It is
one of his periodical inspection tours of
the line. We take them once or twice
a year."
One or two further remarks were
made along this line, showing Ripley's
mission in California was as stated.
Higginson and family left on No. 5 for
the West.
NOMINATED THE MAN
WHO WHIPPED DEWEY
Major Pangborn as a Pedagogue
Conquered the Future Rear-
Admiral.
NEW YORK, Oct. 13.â "Hurrah for
Pangborn, the only man who ever whip
ped Dewey," shouted an enthusiastic
delegate at the Seventh New Jersey
Congressional convention which was held
in Jersey City last night, when it was an
nounced that Major Z. K. Pangborn was
the convention's nominee.
The cry was not so absurd as might ap
pear, for the major did really whip Ad
miral Dewey once, and gave him a sound
thrashing, too. It was away back in the
fifties; long before the major came to
New Jersey. The major was fresh from
college when he undertook to manage the
district school in Montpelier, Vt., which
had long been in revolt.
Young Dewey had been a leader of the
crowd which had made it very unpleas
ant for several young tachers. Pang
born took the school and when Dewey
led the llrst revolt against his authority,
he whipped the future rear admiral with
a rawhide until he begged for mercy.
There was no more trouble in the school
during that term. Dewey and Pangborn
became fast friends. Years afterward,
when Major Pangborn was an editor in
Boston and Dewey was a lieutenant in the
navy, Dewey called upon him and said:
"I shajl ever be grateful to you. You
made a man of me. But for that thrash
ing you gave me I might now be In a
State prison."

Special Dispatch to The Call.
HAVANA, Oct. 13.â The commissions
have apparently decided it is time to
reach some sort of an agreement. Each
held a session this morning and a joint
session was held this afternoon at the
Trocha. This was at the request of
the Spanish commissioners, who made
known at laÃt Sunday's breakfast their
desire for an informal meeting. The
Americans consented and to-day's meet-
Ing was arranged. Each commission
had some things to say which it did
not wish to go on the record.
I was told by a member of the Amer
ican commission that the result of the
conference was an agreement upon the
final date of the evacuation of Cuba by
the Spanish troops and the clearing up
of other matters that have been under
dispute.
The agreement will be sent to Madrid
and if it meets approval there will be
ratified at the regular joint session ot
the committees.
I could not learn the date agreed upon
for the evacuation, but the impression
was given that it was either January 1
or January 15. This does not mean
that the control of customs affairs will
not be assumed by the Americans be
fore that date. It simply means that
time will be allowed for the departure
of the last troops, the Spanish evincing
anxiety to get their men home as soon
as possible. Fully 1500 have left in the
last two days.
The radical Cubans have formed an
organization, the motto of which seems
to be "Down with everything not Cu
ban." They have urged the insurgents
not to give up their arms until the
I Americans as well as the Spanish with
i draw from the island. They oppose
further occupation by the American
forces and say the insurrection must
i continue unless the Cubans are allowed
i to form their own government without
Interference.
EVERYTHING LOVELY
IN PORTO RICO
WASHINGTON, Oct. 13.â The follow
ing cablegram has been received at tha
War Department:
"SAN JUAN DE PORTO RICO, Oct.
12.â Secretary of War, Washington:
The United States Commission has in
formed the Spanish Commission that
the United States expects to have com
plete possession of Porto Rico on OcÂ»

sents to this and says that it is ex
pected the evacuation will be complete
on or before that date. If not, the
Spaniards will concede possession. The
United States Commission has practi
cally completed the details of the evac
uation and, the joint commission has
held its last session and adjourned
without day. The United States troops
will be placed in San Jaun and the flag
hoisted at noon. October 18.
"BROOKE, Major General."
This dispatch is very gratifying to
the War Department officials, as it ends
all contention regarding the possession
of the island of Porto Rico.
PRESIDENT MASO WILL
DISBAND THE CUBANS
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Oct. 13.âSe
nor Bartolome Maso arrived this morn
ing at Manzanillo from Santa Cruz del
Sur, where the Cubans now have their
headquarters and where, on October 20.
the Cuban assembly will meet to elect
a new president and to decide as to
â the plans for disbanding- the army, if
disbandment is considered advisable,
and as to other important matters. He
called at once on Colonel Ray, who re
ceived him courteously and said he
hoped Senor Maso would arrange for
disbanding the Cubans under General
Rios in the neighborhood of Manza
nillo. He also earnestly advised the
President of the Cuban provisional gov
ernment to disband the Cuban troops
at all points now in possession of the
United States forces in order that the
men might give the assistance so great
ly needed to place the country in a
position to recover from the evils of the
three years' war.
Senor Maso readily agreed to carry
out Colonel Ray's request and said that
General Rios would receive orders Im
mediately to disband his men.

SANTA CLARA, Oct. 13.â The Santa.
Clara football eleven will meet the Stan
ford freshmen at Cyclers' Park, San Jose,
on Saturday at 3 p. m. Santa Clara was
victorious by a score of 10 to 0 In a recent
game played by these two teams, but
Since that game Stanford has been great
ly benefited by the coaching of Criss.
Therefore a splendid contest Js looked
forward to by the lovers of football in
this .section.
Belmont's version of the football game
played on October 8 between Santa Clara
College and Belmont, as written by F. P.
Taylor, is as follows:
In the first place I would heartily commend
Panta Clara's captain, Mr. Coward. Santa
Clara's playing was the same old story of pood
backs and a poor line. Without a strong line
th>Â» beat backs tn the world are Dowerless.
Nihill played the strongest game for the line
men.
For Relnvnt Captain Story, quarterback,
handled his tram well and played a magnifi
cent game Every man played his position In
first-class order. Santa Clara does not show
the teamwork that will be developed later in
the sealer..

Special Dispatch to The Call.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Oct. 13.â
Nothing could be more enthusiastic
than tin student anti-taxation rally
held in the chapel this evening. Mem
bers of the alumni were present to in
tensify the Stanford spirit and assist
in the formulation of plans for the
movement to free the university from
the burden of taxes that is impairing
its usefulness. Before the rally the
students, headed by the university
band, marched all over the campus,
shautinK "Rah! rah! rah!" with anti
taxation yells.
The meeting was called to order by
President C. E. Schwartz, president of
the student body, who introduced C. K.
Field, 'I*s, of San Francisco as chair
man of the evening. The purpose of
the meeting, Chairman Field stated,
was to organize the alumni and stu
dents in an effective campaign for ex
emption.
G. Crcthers, '95, San Jose, insisted on
the necessity of students using personal
influence on Assemblymen ana Senators
to secure a constitutional amenament
which will exempt Stanford from the
tax cm the property that is not pro
ductive and not in competition, as well
as on the personal property of the uni
versity, fie thought it advisable to

ADVOCATES AN INCREASE IN

Efforts of Ameri
cans.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
OMAHA, Oct. 13.â General Nelson A. 1
Miles was the central figure in the re
ception tendered to the army heroes at
the exposition to-day. It was another
ideal exposition to-day.
The crowd was by no means sugges
tive of the surging multitude of the day
before, but it far exceeded that of or
dinary occasions. Thousands of people
who had been unable to get into the
grounds to see the President came out
early to be sure and see General Miles,
and before 11 o'clock the Auditorium
was filled to the doors.
General Miles entered the building a
few minutes later, escorted by Presi
dent Wattles and accompanied by his
staff. General Greeley, several mem
bers of the diplomatic corps, Governor
Holcomb and members of the local re
ception committee.
Governor Holcomb was introduced to
speak in welcome to the guests of the
day. The Governor alluded to Gen
eral Miles as the hero of two wars,
which incited a tumult of cheers and
handclapping, which did not subside
until President Wattles led the distin
guished soldier to the front of the plat
form, when the crowd arose and greet
ed him with three ringing cheers.
An allusion to General Greeley pro
duced a similar demonstration, and k
was repeated when General Miles was
Introduced. He said:
"I am deeply gratified that the people
of the West have set aside one day of
this exposition in honor of the army
and navy of the United States. By the
army and navy I mean every part of
the physical force that has added to
the strength, perpetuity and gTandeur
of this republic."
The speaker contended for the neces
sity of a military force commensurate
with the interests and importance of
the nation. There should be at least
one well equipped and disciplined sol
dier to every 1000 of our population, he
said. As the nation is developed the
army and navy should gTow in propor
tion.
The introduction of General A. W.
Greeley was followed by another hearty
demonstration. His sympathetic refer
ence to General Wheeler, who had been
expected to speak at this time, but who
was trying to do his duty in the face of
his terrible bereavement, was heard
with a silence that was an eloquent ex
pression of sympathy of the audience.
Senor Gonzales de Quesada received a
greeting that carried all the hearty en
thusiasm that had characterized those
which had been extended to the pre
vious speakers. He declared that the
emotions that almost mastered him at
this moment were sufficient proof that
Cuba is not ungrateful. He eloquently
pictured the desolation in Cuba, but
declared that there is one flower that
still blossoms, and this was the grati
tude of the heroes of three generations
to the people who had fought side by
side with them to give them liberty.
The exercises closed with a short ad
dress by Senator Allen, who spoke in
behalf of the veterans of the Civil War,
and then the official party adjourned to
the cafe, where an elaborate luncheon
was served.

'BEFORE SANTIAGO'S FALL
MAJOR SEAMAN TO DANCE ON
THE CARPET.
Charged With Having Made Sensa
tional Charges Against the Con
duct of the Quartermaster's
Department.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 13.â After de
voting the forenoon to hearing the tes
timony of Dr. Hoff, the chief surgeon of
the Third Army Corps, stationed at
Camp Tho-mas, 'he War Investigating
Commission ga\ _, the remainder of to
day to the reading of papers submitted
by Secretary Alger, with his statement
concerning the conduct of the war.
The documents reveal the fact that
General Miles recommended the occu
pation of the Isle of Pines about the
time of the battle of Santiago, and that
Secretary Alger disapproved the sug
gestion. It aJso appears that General
Miles recommended that some point
between Santiago and Porto Rico be
taken previous to the beginning of
either campaign.
The correspondence also developed
the fact that there was an apparent
conflict of authority between General
Miles and General Shatter at Tampa
before the Santiago campaign was in
augurated. It also shows that orders
were issued by the Secretary of War
that in the event that General Shatter
should be disabled by sickness or other
cause the command of the troops at
Santiago should devolve upon General
Wheeler and upon the next in command
in case of the disability of both Shatter
and Wheeler.
The commission has summoned Major
Louis L. Seaman, a surgeon o-f the First
Volunteer Engineers, to appear before
it, and he is expected to testify at to
morrow's session. He has recently
been quoted as saying that 200 men had
died daily because of the maladminis
tration of the quartermaster's depart
ment.
Dr. Hoff said the capacity of the di
vision hospitals was often doubled and
trebled. On one or two occasions pa
tients were necessarily placed in beds
made upon the floors, because of a
temporary deficiency in cots. As a rule
the nurses were without training, and
this fact occasioned some difficulty in
dealing with the typhoid cases. Yet
he had known of no specific case of
suffering on this account.
Dr. Hoff said that the shortage in
medical supplies had continued for sev
eral weeks, but there was generally
sufflcient to meet the immediate de
mands. He also said that some requi
sitions had been returned by the Wash
ington authorities because improperly
filled, and he was under the impression
that there had been complaints of some
suffering on this account.
Dr. Connor read an extract from tha
letter of the Arkansas Governor saying
that he had made a personal investiga
tion of the conditions in this hospital
and that he had found "the conditions
deplorable â simply disgraceful."
He charged that thÂ« doctors in the in
stitution were all Northern men, unfa
miliar with diseases incidental to the
South. Fever patients had gone with
out water for twenty-four hours, and
sick men went without attention from
a surgeon or without receiving a dose
of medicine for a week.

lal Plspatrh to The Call.
FAN* JOSE, Oct 13.â The Jarman-
Rea slander trial still proves a strong
drawing card, and Judge Kittredgre's
court was packed again to-day. The
defense finished its case this forenoon,
and Attorney Delmas then began the
Introduction of testimony in rebuttal,
â¢which occupied the balance of the day.
Jarmnn's testimony in rebuttal put a
new liETht on Rea's mass of statements
made while a witness. He denied all
the allegations made by the boss that
his record as a Councilman was not
perfectly straight and showed that the
allegations were false. Jarman gave a
lucid explanation of the nart lv played
in supervising: the painting: of the City
Hall and work done on some of the en
gine houses. The statement that he de
manded the painting of the . Rhinehart
flats for his vote in the Council on a
change of the fire limits in order that
they could be built of wood was denied,
and this fact was corroborated by two
witnesses. From Jarman's testimony
it was plain that Rea had made some
misstatements.
F. J. Underwood was the first witness !
to-day. Underwood stated he was
standing in front of Mrs. Knox-Good
rich's place on North First street on
March 14. watching some boys trim a
tree. At that time Jarman was direct-
Ing the paintinp of a fence. Two paint- j
ers were at work on the job. Witness
heard some loud talking and turned
around and saw Jarman and Rea en- j
gaged in an alterc-tion. Witness re- !
lated his version of it. and added that â 
Jarman called Rea a scoundrel and
boodler. ,|
Rea replied: "Jack, I know what you
want me to do. You want me to hit
you as I did Ditters and create sympa- I
thy for you, No, I'll n<>t do that. You
know it ha? always been my principle
never to strike a child, woman, cripple, j
or fool."
"You are a scoundrel, boodler and an !
associate of thieves and drunken
Hums," was jarman's response.
Witness said Rea then walked away.
Jarman was recalled by Attorney
Delmas to Rive testimony In rebuttal, j
He gave some strong- testimony. He de- j
nied nearly all the statements made by j
Rea, and his story created a good im- |
pression with the spectators.
Jarman said that he did not remem
ber petting any work from Rea's office
after he refused to accept the slate of
firemen and policemen made at Rea's
house. Along in April his store had put
in three small lights of glass in a house
on North Fourth street for Rea & Co.
The bill for this work was $1 20. Jar
man stated he had gone to Rea's office
once in company with C. M. Short
ridge, who wanted Rea to support Jar
man for Supervisor. He had been to
Rea's office several times since trying L
to collect bills from parties employed j
there. Witness had supported James i
Reed for policeman because he was
very gentlemanly and an efficient of
ficer.
Jarman denied he had c had a
conversation with Rea in which he had
agreed to support Rea's ticket. He
had never entered into any agreement
with Ren. Witness said Rea never
warned him of the bad character of
Krieg and Dlttus. nor had he told wit
ness what would be expected of him if
elected to the Council.
This was a direct contradiction to por
tions of Rea's testimony.
Jarman stated he had not sought the
office of Councilman and never went to
Rea's office asking the latter's help to
get the place. He had not even gone to
the convention and did not know he
had been nominated until after it was
done. Krieg and Dittus were already
in the Council when he took his seat,
as was Nolting. At no time had he
been in a combine with Dittus and
Krieg.
Rea had called at his store to see him
and wanted him to support the slate
put up at the boss' house. Witness
refused to have anything to do with his
caller in this respect.
Jarman also denied he had ever dis
cussed the changing of the fire limits
in order to allow the rebuilding of the
Rhinehart flats on South Third street
with Rea or any representative of the
boss. He had voted for the change
to keep the capital from going- to Den
ver, and the fiats were an ornament
and benefit to the city. He had told
O. A. Rhine-hart he favored the chang
ing of the fire limits. He had secured
the painting of the buildings in compe
tition with three or four other bidders.
In regard to painting the City Hall
he had only supervised the work at the
instance of Councilman Mangrum,
chairman of the construction commit
tee. He had derived no benefit, finan
cially or otherwise, from the work.
The materials for the work were pur
chased in equal parts from the paint
houses of McKee, Rinaldo and Lenzen.
The painters engaged on the work were
hired at the instance of the various
Councilmen.
Jarman said he had not nainted any
engine-house while in the Council.
After he got out of the Council he fur
nished materials for painting and pa
pering the Empire engine-house and
doing some other work, and had loaned
his staging to the men who did tho
work. There were three distinct bills,
amounting to about $152. "When wit
ness was at Salinas his wife had pre
sented these three claims In one to thÂ«
Council. This was In violation of th*
charter, which provided that work
amounting to over $100 Should be given
out by contract. He subsequently seg
regated the claims and they were
paid.
"Did you secure any money on th*
purchase of the steam roller?" asked
Delmas.
"No, sir," replied witness.
"Mr. Jarman, did you receive any
money on the purchase of the rolleh
after you left the Council?"
"No, sir."
Jarman stated he saw Maggard In
this city after the purchase of the*
roller, when a trial of the machine was |
being made. He had tried to find Ma?
gard slice suit began, and (heard he
w.i s in lowa City. lowa.
Rea had come to him and asked him
to- vote for his slate. The boss had told
him Krieg wanted $1000 for the privi
lege of making a slate. Witness thought
this statement of- Rea's a lie and the
"emanation of a depraved nature."

Colonel Jewett Tells Striking
Truths About Luzon in an
Official Report.
BY P. N. BOERINGER.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
MANILA. Sept. 6.â Much of history unwritten to-day will be told
when the lips of the correspondents shall not be sealed by the censor.
The systematic objection to anything rellecting upon Aguinaldo's
actions has prevented much being told that would be of value to the
American public in forming an opinion regarding these islands.
Colonel Jewett, the Indiana jurist, the judge advocate of the
army, filed a report with General Merritt previous to his departure.
Unfortunately the document itself cannot be published and is not
available at this moment, but I can vouch for the following conclu
sions arrived at by Colonel Jewett after a careful investigation cov
ering nearly two months. Colonel Jewett was not attached to any
particular corps and his conclusions are arrived at after conversa
tions with Admiral Dev.ey, with prominent natives, with the rebel
lious chiefs and later with the Spaniards themselves after the fall of
Manila:
1. The mass of the people are docile and well disposed, and
would cheerfully submit to any government that without insolence
or oppression would firmly control and intelligently direct them.
2. The rebellion against the authorities of Spain was originally
only an outbreak against the abuses and irritations, the agents and
instruments of that Government, and dik not Include any well defined
notion of independent national existence.
3. The ; are not now fitted for local self government or citi
zenship as those terms are used and understood in the United States.
4. Spain cannot anywhere in the near future discharge the duty
of government toward life and property in the island of Luzon.
5. The insurrectionary government, so-called, could not sustain
itself even in this island.
G. The form of government maintained in the territories of the
United States prior to their being admitted as States of the Union
is not practicable here at the present time.
From this it will be seen that we are as a nation in the position
of the man who had the bull by the tail. We cannot let go and
we do not want the V>ull!
1 have private information to the effect that Admiral Dewey
has said, "We certainly shall retain the island of Luzon."

voted against Krieg and Nolting. This
Rd against Krieg and year after the
especially so the year after the
j caucus at Rea's house, when the elec
tion of police and firemen came up. The
funds were especially low at that time,
! and, with the exception of himself and
Mangrum, the Council wanted to in
grease the police force to twenty-three
men and also increase the force of the
Fire Department. Witness had intro
and also increase the force of the
Department. Witness had intro
duced an ordinance against the in
crease.
At the time the roller was purchased
Jarman said the street fund, from
which the purchase was to be made,
was in better condition than ever be
fore. On April 1 of that year there was
over $17,000 in the fund and over $20,000
due from the second installment of
taxes.
Mrs. Harry Harper, the ' only lady
witness that has thus far figured in
the case, was next called. She was a
member of the Rhinehart family and
one of the trustees of that estate. She
testified that Jarman had been given
the painting of the buildings in com
petition.
F. G. Currier, a painter, said he had
bid on the work. His price was $1247,
which was considerably higher than
Jarman's.
S. G. Tompkins was recalled. His
testimony showed that from where he
was standing when he and Rea held a
conversation, in which the latter char
acterized Jarman as crooked, to Rea's
office was fully twenty-five feet. This
tended to show that Leet, Shaw and
Smith, who testified yesterday in behalf
of Rea, could not have heard the con
versation.
Attorney Delmas said he would like
to ask Morehouse a question. ; "Mr.
Morehouse," he continued, "have you a
check in your possession from Mr. Mag
gard to Krieg for $300?"
Burchard objected. Delmas then pro
duced an alleged interview- with More
house that appeared in the San Fran
cisco Bulletin. Morehouse denounced
the interview as a fake and said he had
never stated he had such a check. An
attempt was made to put the interview
in evidence, but an objection was sus
tained. The plaintiff then rested.
The defense announced they had a
couple of witnesses to put on in the
morning. This will complete their case.
Argument .will 1 then commence.

HARD TREATMENT
AT FORT BAKER
Volunteers Say Bad
Food Is Given.
ON THE VERGE OF REVOLT
HAVE SYMPATHY WITH THOSE
WHO DESERT.
Tents Not Impervious to Water and
Tines Imposed for Trivial Of
fenses Declared Most
Unjust.
Special Dispatch to The fall.
SAUSALITO, Oct. 13.â The boys in
blue at Fort Baker are nearly ir> open
revolt over the alleged unjust treat
ment they are receiving at the hands
of the War Department, and the offi
cers in charge of the post. Among
their grievances are the claims that
the food given them is small in quan
tity and nauseating in quality; that the
tents in which they sleep are not im
pervious to water, and that the discip
line enforced is far too rigorous fur
volunteers and would make a regular
soldier "kick."
Last Saturday morning Private Ed
ward Downs, who had been confined in
the guardhouse for forty-three days
and was awaiting his court-martial for
desertion, which was to have taken
place Monday, made his escape and has
not been recaptured. The feeling that
prevails at the fort is well illustrated
by the statement of three privates,
made to a Call reporter, that even if
they knew where the deserter was and
were in a search party they would
endeavor to lead the party in another
direction.
"Most of us," bitterly remarked one
of the privates, "left goud homes in San
Francisco and volunteered for service
at a time when the nation needed us.
Now we can stsnd here at night and
look away across the water a few miles
to where the lights are twinkling mock
ingly and think that two more years
of this stares us in the face. It is sim
ply maddening, and I do not blame any
man for deserting. I shall be very
sorry if they ever find any trace of him.
"Why, the food we get is sickening.
Two weeks ago there came a consign
ment of beef in such a rotten condi
tion that even the officers could not
Hnd it in their hearts to ask us to eat
it, and it was thrown in the bay. The
canned salmon is always tainted. The
milk is frequently sour and nearly
everything else bad. The only good
thing we get Is the bread. If it were
not for that, we would be in a bad
way."
"Yes," said another, "it is all right
for the officers. They are drawing good
pay and have plenty of good food. But
the small sum we make is frequently
taken away in fines, sometimes as
much as $10 for a trivial offense. They
expect us to t>e more -xemplary in ob
serving the rules than regulars would
be."
Lieutenant Choynski evidently holds
the opinion credited to one of the Van
dorbilts. Some time ago he was in
interviewed regarding complaints of the
volunteers at the fort, and said the way
the affairs of the post were conducted
was no affair of the public or the pa
pers. He thought that it was an un
pardonable offense to criticize military
affairs, because it encouraged the men
to make complaint when there was no
necessity for it.

CALIFORNIA KNIGHTS
ENTERTAIN VISITORS
PITTSBURG Pa., Oct. 13.â While
other commanderies were packing up
their swords and uniforms, running to
catch trains and otherwise preparing to
say farewell to Pittsburg. California
Commander- No. 1 of San Francisco
was opening the doors of its magnifi
cent headquarters in the Carneeie
building to the other Knights Templar
who had not yet left the city.
For two or three days past it was ru
mored that the folks from the Golden
Gate were preparing to "do business"
in a fashion for which California is
noted. It was known that when San
Francisco entertained the triennial con
clave fifteen years ago all records
were eclipsed and one established that
will never be outdone. It was further
known that California Commanderv
No. 1, which had come to Pittsburg as
I the escort of the State Grand Com
mandery which displayed 5500 uni
forms, and which rode the forty black
horses in the parade, was the, whole
thing, or as they used to say out on the
coast, "the whole works."
The doors were opened promptly at 10
o'clock, and the crush for admittance
was so great that as soon as the hall
had been filled the doors were closed
until the people inside had inspected the
interior of the building and had passed
out. At yesterday's reception there was
a crush, but from 10 a. m. to-day until
midnight it required a detail of police
to maintain order on the sidewalks. The
California knights, headed by Eminent
Commander J. P. Fraser, assisted by a
corps of thirty servants, began to pre
pare for to-day's reception from 11 to
7 and the second from 8 to 12 p. m., the
latter being the grand commandery of
California's reception to other grand
commandeiies. When the doors were
opened at 11:30 a. m. there was a line
extending from the doors clear up to
Grant street, and a crowd of 1000 in the
street. The guests were admitted not
In blocks of five, but in ma. c ses of 500. j
They found the big room beautifully
decorated with palms and cut flowers.
while about the walls were hung im
mense panel pictures of sir knights of
renown, which had been ordered for
Duquesne Garden, but could not be
used at that magnificent pleasure
palace.
There was an orchestra dispensing
music, and there was a corps of wait
ers dispensing other thinsrs. A great
table was laden down with huge bas
kets of grapes plums, anricotn. pears,
watermelons, etc. As fast as they dis
appeared more were brought in through
the rear door, and the supply seemed
Inexhaustible.
The ladies, on being admitted were
received by Mrs. Frnser. wifp of the
eminent commander: Mrs. Marron, Mrs.
Wright. Mrs. Tonningsen and Mrs. Tul
ler. These ladies resented each of
their guests with a bnsket of fruit
grown in California. The visiting Sir
Knights were received by Eminent
Commander J. P. Fraser and Sir
Knights T. J. Fraser, L. A. Larson, J.
Tonningsen, P. D. Jewett. Tl. F. Gar
rett. G. H. Dyer. Dr. R. W. Smith. P.

MAY GO UNDER
AMERICAN FLAG
Six British Steamers to j
Change Registry.
LAMONT ENGINEERING IT
PLAN OF THE NORTHERN PA
CIFIC COMPANY.
Future Action Probably Hinges Upon
Whether Uncle Sam Intends to
Retain the Philip
pines.
Sprcal Dispatch to The Call. J
TACOMA, Oct. 13.â 1t is stated on j
good authority that the Northern Pacl
flc Steamship Company is arranging to
put under the American flap: six Brith- i
ish steami-rs which it is operating to j
China and Japan from this city. These j
steamers include tho transport Arizona, j
which was sold to the Government last i
July, when available steamers for
transport service were scarce. It de
velops that at that time Daniel S. La
mont, vice-president of the Northern
Pacific Railway, and others interested,
secured pf ssage by Congress of a law
permitting the giving of American reg
istry to th> Northern Pacific Steamshin
Company 1 !; steamers. This was de
sired because Mr. Lamont, Mr. Dodwell.
managing director of the steamship
line, and other traffic men recocnized
the advantages to be derived by the op
eration of steamers that could carry
traffic between the Pacific Coast and
Hawaii and the Philippine Islands.
As understood here the company vir
tually has the option under this law of
retaining British registry or changing
to American. The company is now
seemingly waiting to ascertain whether
the American Government is to retajh
the Philippine Islands. If it does, as is
expected, then a change of registry will
be speedily effected. The company's
officers here, including Manager Dod
well, declined to-day to make any
statement for publication, but did not
deny that arrangements are in progress
for making su<?h a change. Vice-Presi
dent Lamont has charge of the matter
in the East, including the necessary
negotiations with the Treasury Depart
ment regarding the details.
The steamers affected by the pro
posed change are the Tacoma. Olympla,
Columbia, Arizona and Argyle. The
Government had an option on all of
them last summer when Merritt's army
was being hurried to Manila, but only
the Arizona was taken. It Is believed
that Bhe will be transferred back to the
Northern Pacific Company at Hong
kong when the Government no longer
needs her. While the war lasted the
British Government refused to cancel
the British registry of these steamers
on the ground that such action would
be a violation of the nuetrallty laws.
All considerations of this kind have
been brushed aside by the peace pro
tocol.
URGES THE CLAIMS OF
CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS
General Barrett Asks That the
Eighth Go to Manila and That
Surgeons Be Properly Paid.
WASHINGTON. Oct. IS.â Adjutant Gen
eral Barrett of California had a talk to
day with Secretary Alger and Adjutant
General Corbin In regard to sending: the
Eighth California Regiment to Manila.
General Barrett urged that the Eighth
California was anxious to go forward and
see real military life, and wanted to go
as soon as possible. Secretary Alger and
Adjutant General Corbin were attentive
listeners to what General Barrett had to
say, and he was assured before he left
the office that if any of the regiments
now ordered to Manila shdwed any signs
of mustering-out fever, and also If any
more troops are wanted at the Philip
pines, the Eighth Regiment will be trie
regiment to go.
General Barrett, while here, will try
to see what he can do in havkig the salar
ies of assistant surgeons of California
volunteers adjusted. Surgeons of Cali
fornia, when enrolled into the service,
were of the opinion that their salaries
would be the same as that which was
being paid in the regular army and of
the samo rank as in the regular army,
that is a salary of a mounted captain,
or $2000 a year. The first month these
surgeon* received their right salary, but
have failed to receive a Ike amount since
then. All the surgeons in the California
volunteers have entered their protest.
STOLEN TREASURES FOUND.
Enormously Bich One Found Secreted
in a Cave at Leadville.
I.EADVILLE. Colo., Oct. 13.â While
kicking about some dirt at the city dump,
Frank Burkhart unearthed a cave, In
which he found some very rich ore. The
officers were at once notified, and upon In
vestigation found a cache from which
they extracted lifty sacks of gold and Sil
ver orr.
The stuff had evidently been hidden
away during the last ten days, and had
been stolen from different mines, as It
was of different qualities. From samples
assayed, it was all 3hown to be enormous
ly rich, and the lot will probably prove 10
be worth $110,000.
SUPREME COURT TO
RULE ON GAMBLING
Case -Involving the Status of Club
Booms and Gaming Houses
in California.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 13.â Some time
: ago the City Council passed an ordinance
I ironclad in Us nature which, if strictly
enforced, would close every one of the
200 poker ruoms in this city. The ordl
| nance was drawn by Job Harriman, the
I Socialist Labor candidate for Governor
lof this State. Thf Chief of Police started
to enforce tho ordinance and closed one
of the most notorious dens in the city,
Known as the Arizona Clubrooms, arr<^s~t
irtg the proprietors. A. B. Smith and P. J.
Wilson. The furniture and all the gam
bling paraphernalia were confiscated.
To-day Attorney Shinn. on behalf of
one of the proprietor*. P. J. Wilson, pre
sented a petition to the Supreme Court
asking his release on a writ of habeas
corpus. The petition contends that the
imprisonment is Illegal in that h-e was
convicted of an offense under an ordi
nance which the City Council of Los
Angeles bad no legal right to pass for
the reason that no authority exists in
the charter of the city for its passage. It
is claimed that the ordinance is uncon
stitutional and void in that a game of
poker or drawnoktr or a game played
with cards is not an unlawful game, and
the conducting of a room or apartment
or place for the playing of a game with
cards is not unlawful.
The Supreme Court will pass on the
point in a few days, and the decision
given will affect club rooms in all places
where the local authorities have made
any attempt to suppress them.

Ppeoial Dispatch to Tha Call.
FRESNO, Oct. 13. â "Welcome to
Henry T. Gage, our n*Â»xt Governor,"
â ivere thf words inscribed on a banner 1
nded across J street in the center
of Fresno, and the warmth of the wel- !
come was manifested by the cheering
acclaim of thousands. This afternoon
Mr. Gage, accompanied by the eloquent
campaigner. Colonel E. P. Preston, left
Hanford, saluted by the cheers and,
gor>d wishes of the dauntless Repub- ;
Ucana of Kings County. Before they |
left the hotel at Hanford a delegation j
from the ranks of the Fresno County
Republicans met them and escorted J
them to this city. At the Hanford ]
station of the Valley road there was a
large concourse of people, and as the
train moved away three rousing cheers
were given for Henry T. Gage, the next j
Governor of California. The Fresno j
delegation that met Gage and Preston j
was Composed of the following citizens: i
J >hn Shanklin. H. E. Barnum, M. S. j
Rope, C. L. Walter, C. Bachtold, C. W.
Garrett, William Shaw, Judge V. I. j

W. Smith and Captain A. H. Powers.
After a short run over the well-built
Valley road through a beautiful and
productive region of California the su
burbs of Fresno were reached. Blasts
from numerous steam whistles, an ar
tillery salute and inspiring music by
the Raisin City band signaled to the
waiting throng that the next Governor
had arrived. Gage and Preston were
soon seated in a comfortable equipage
and trusted themselves to the skill of
Commodore Fulton G. Berry as the
driver of the four horses attached to
the vehicle. The party was landed
without any mishap at the entrance to
the Grand Central Hotel. In the pro
cession which followed the carriage and
marched to the music of the band was
the National Republican League Club
of Fresno, 500 strong.
Meanwhile a vast crowd of cheering
citizens had assembled at the corner of
Mariposa and J streets. The shouts for
Gage were so earnest and prolonged |
that the standard bearer came to the
balcony of the hotel and in a brief
speech thanked the multitude for the
magnificent demonstration. He did not
take the greeting as a tribute to him
self, but saw in the demonstration
abiding loyalty of the people to the
principles and purposes of the Republi
can party. Excusing himself from ex
tended remarks on the ground that he
would speak at length to-night on po
litical issues of the day he sought an
hour's rest. He was soon advised by
wire from the Republican State Central
Committee that additional daylight en
gagements had been made for him in
his triumphal journey through the no
ble San Joaquin Valley. The commit
tee must think that Mr. Gatre is gifted
â¢with more than the powers of human
endurance, for they keep tacking on ex
tra visits to cover towns not em
braced in the original plan for the tour
of the valley. If a halt is not soon call
ed the standard bearer will succumb to
the tax on his physical resources, and
some of the night engagements will be
canceled to afford him a chance to re
new hiÃ strength.
The cordiality which the people of all
parties extend to Mr. Gage, the un
bounded enthusiasm of the masses and
the remarkable unity of the Republican
legions excite the comment of all
classes. If successive demonstrations
of popular confidence, growing in mag
nitude as the campaign advances, can
be accepted as an index of the candi
date's strength, the surprise of the
November election will be the enormous
majorities for the candidates on the
Republican State ticket.
Right here In Fresno where Bryan
received more than 1100 majority, the
most conservative Republicans are con
fident that the State fusion ticket will
not get a majority of 500. Other Re
publicans, whose judgment may be in
fluenced by cheering reports, insist that
Gage will carry Fresno County. They
cite the fact that 3500 names have been
added to the list of registration since
1896, and that the increase is largely
Republican. Complete harmony and
extraordinary activity in the conduct
Of the campaign on behalf of the Re
publican cause strengthen the hope of
victory in this county.
From 4 o'clock in the afternoon until
8 o'clock this evening the crowds that
thronged the streets of Fresno grew in
density. The people came from Selma,
Fowler, Sanger, Porterville, Clovis, Pol
lasky, Madera, Firebaugh, Mendota,
Toll House and from the orchards,
vineyards and ranches of this famouÃly
rich region of California.
The Barton Opera House, packed to
the limit of its capacity, did not afford
room to accommodate one half the
number of people that came to the
doors, hoping to gain admission. The
.^ure to get in was so great that
he doors had to be closed.
The earnest and intelligent audience
was called to order by Judge H. Z.
Austin, chairman of the Republican
County Central Committee. He named
as chairman of the assemblage Dr.
Chester Rowell. Republican nominee
for State Senator in the Sixteenth Dis
trict. The long Uat of vice-presidents
embraced the names of many of the I
most lnlluentlal and worthy men of
Fresno, representing the industrial pur
suits of the progressive community.
Dr. Roweli on assuming the duties
of his position said there was no bet
ter way to estimate a man's worth
than that of accepting the estimate of
the community in which the man lived.
No man stood higher In the Los An
geles community than Henry T. Gape.
In this campaign Mr. Gage was the
representative of i grand political
party. Dr. Rowell said It was his pleas
ure to present Mr. Gage to the audi
ence.
The applause of the vast concourse
was intense and long continued as the
standard-bearer stepped forward in re
sponse to the welcome. Mr. Gage In
opening his address Invited the atten
tion of his hearers to the noble admin
istration of President McKlnley. and
remarked that sectional lines had been
obliterated and the people of the whole
land united In one sentiment of pat
riotic devotion to the country. Mr.
Gage acknowledged the courage of Jef- I
fersonian Democrats, men who were j
devoted to certain principles of govern- !
ment which they believed would pro
mote the best interests of the govern
ment. He paid a tribute to the bravery
of the Populists who left the old party
hoping to better the conditions of pub
lic affairs. As Popu-lists and Demo
crats had been betrayed by fusion he
expected that many of them would sup
port the Republican cause in the con
be decided next month.
Jn the course of his masterly speech
the standard bearer exposed the dan- I
gers of the single tax scheme. He re- |
viewed the railroad settlement, show- !
Ing the double dealing of the Little
Giant in connection with the adiust
ment.
Maguire's assault upon the integrity
of the delegates to the Republican j
State Convention was eloquently re
pelled. Maguire's assertion that the
publication of the successful nominees j
of the Republican Convention in The
Call in advance of their nomination
was proof of railroad domination was
cleverly met. It was caid in reply by j
Mr. Gage that The Call announced two ,
weeks before the Democratic Conven- j
tion met that Maguire would be the
nominee. Was not that proof, accord- ,
ing to Maguire logic, that the Southern ;
Pacific Railroad dominated the Demo
cratic convention?
The audience listened with close at
tention to Mr. Gage's review of his own
career in California from boyhood until j
the present hour, and his consistent
course of opposition to railroad monop
oly and corporate aggression. In Fres
no, as in other places, the manifest sin
cerity and veracity of the Republican ,
standard-bearer won the favor of his ;
audience. The people saw in him a
man of the people, who Avas never a j
chronic seeker of office. So many jaw- j
smiths are trying to hold a grip on the
public treasury by shouting oppression
and railroad domination that the plain,
straightforward talk of an honest man
with an honest record is quite refresh- !
ing to the popular mind. Gage made
his puints with telling effect, and fre
quent shouts of approval encouraged
him. The speech to-night surpassed his
former efforts. He turned the light on j
Maguire's record so skillfully that the ,
le could see through it Â«md esti- j.
mate its weakness. !
An incident of the meeting to-night j
aroused the audience to the wildest de- ]
of enthusiasm. It indicated the
lor power and readiness of Gage;,
when he encounters opposition. While ; â¢
he was handling Maguire's single tax ,
record he read from one of Maguire s ;
speeches that no man had indestructi- |
ble right to the soil. A man In the au
dionce interrupted with this remark,
addressed to Mr. Gage:
"Have you anything to say against ,
that?" Â_
'Yes I have," said Mr. Gage. For
example: A man buys from the Gov- j
eminent a quarter-section of land on
the frontier. He goes there with his
wife and children, repels the savage â 
foe, endures perils, hardships and years j
of honest toil to acquire a home. Ulti
mately, when the land becomes worth
say $20,000, and that sum Is offered, I
assert that the honest home-builder
should receive the reward of his toil." |
A mighty roar of prolonged applause I
and cheers thrice repeated signified the
delight of the audience and indicated j
the abhorrence with which the people
view the odious single-tax scheme.
When the applause subsided some one
shouted, "Put him out," referring to
the man who had interrupted.
"No, no, no," responded Mr. Gage, |
who quickly went to the rescue of the \
interrupting citizen. The standard- ,
bearer paid a compliment to the manli- j
ness and sincerity of the man who !
asked the question and desired that the ;
right of the humblest to seek informa
tion should be respected.
The introduction of Hon. E. F. Pres
ton was the sig-nal for another burst j
of applause. He began his forcible and
eloquent address by a remark that he
did not speak as the attorney of the
Valley Road, but as an American citi
zen who valued the right and had the j
courage to speak his sentiments to his
fellow citizens. Denial was given of j
the rumor that the Valley Road was i
selling out to the Southern Pacific. Mr.
Preston referring to the campaign of j
calumny, deception and abuse, said the !
latest assertion that the Valley Road
was sold out was a lie.
Tremendous cheering was the re
sponse to Mr. Preston's pointed utter-
anoe.
"Would you like to hear the whistle
of the Santa Fe in Fresno?" asked Mr.
Preston.
A thousand people shouted, "Yes."
The. speaker then said that the engi- ;
neers were in the mountains inspecting j
the Tejon Pass as a preliminary step to
the construction of the Valley Road
from Bakersfield to Los Angeles.
The talked-of oppression of the
masses by the classes engaged the no
tice of Mr. Preston. In this regard the
Bpeaker advanced the assertion that no
such oppression exists in the United
States. Single tax was also discussed.
The intelligent and convincing address ]
of the eloquent orator deeply interested
the audience and evoked at frequent in
tervals the, applause of his hearers.
At the conclusion of Mr. Preston's ad
dress the vast meeting at the Barton
Opera House adjourned with three tie- j
mendous cheers for Gage and Neff.
The second or overflow meeting at [
Courthouse Park, composed of an aa- [
sembly of 1000 people who could not j
gain admission to the opera house, was |
as earnest and enthusiastic as the as
semblage indoors.
John C. Moore presided at tne open
air demonstration. It was exceedingly
fortunate for the Republican cause that
Major C. W. Kyle, an eloquent cam
paign speaker, happened to be in Fresno
this evening. His oratorical abilities
were utilized to entertain and instruct
the people assembled at the park. Ma
i jor Kyle spoke for one hour, dwelling j
i on the issues that engross the public j
! mind in this campaign. Territorial ex- ]
panslon, the achievements of American
valor on land and sea, the excellence of
McKiiley's administration and the per- !
' Us of Maguire's single tax dogmas were ;
I the subjects discussed by the speaker, j
! The audience cheered the expressions of I
â  Republican sentiment. Words of praise j
to o-ld-line Democrats evoked applause.
M. V. Ashbrook of Fresno also ad
dressed the open-air, meeting. His :
j able, clear and comprehensive talk '
Added to the interest of the meeting, j
Much regret was expressed that Mr. j
Gage could not address the overflow
meeting, but the plain fact is that the
standard-bearer has reached the limit
of human endurance in speech-making j
' and hand-snaking. Many people came ;
from vineyards and farms twenty-five i
miles distant to hear him and their dis- I
; appointment 1s keen.
The rushing schedule which the State
; Central Committee has adopted through
its lack of judgment or incorrect in
formation compels Mr. Gage to leave
; Fresno at dawn to-morrow.
Republican enthusiasm to-night is un- I
, bounded. The great outpouring of the!
I masses is the talk of the city.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 14, 189 a.
MAGUIRE SPEAKS
AT ANGELS CAMP
Throws Mud Freely at
All Republicans.
ACCUSATIONS AGAINST CALL
SAYS IT IS A RAILROAD ORGAN
AND FIXED STATE TICKET.
Claims Single Tax Is Not an Issue,
and Offers to Instruct Mr.
Gage on the Sub
ject.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ANGELS CAMP, Oct. 13.âCongress
man Maguire addressed a large and en
thusiastic meeting at 2 o'clock to-day.
He spoke for one and a half hours, but
applause was very scarce. His whole
address was centered on a few ideas
which formed themselves into regular
mud-slinging whenever Mr. Gage or the
Republican platform was mentioned.
He accused The Call of being a railroad
organ and of having been a party to
fixing a slate at the Republican con
vention at Sacramento.
The single tax question, he claimed,
{ was not an issue, and that it was simply
|in a very crude state as yet. He said
' that Gage was but a figurehead in the
! Republican party and Barnes was really
I the only speaker out and he was a
thorough railroad man. Gage and
Barnes were altogether ignorant of the
principles of Congressional proceedings
and altogether unfit to speak upon the
j single tax proposition. After the cam-
I paign he said he would condescend to
teach these representatives of the Re
publican party what was lacking in
their education in matters political pro
i vided they should devote three months
! to the careful study of the matter pre
viously.
He continually coupled the names of
j Lincoln and Jefferson and insisted upon
it that they both stood alike for De
mocracy when any important issue was
:at stake. The silver question was but
briefly mentioned, and the Nicaragua
' canal question was adopted as one by
which he could dominate the Republi
' cans as a lot of scheming politicians
! attempting to throw this matter en
i tirely into- the hands of the railroads.
Mr. Hutchison followed Maguire and
spoke very briefly. He lauded Maguire
j to the skies and held him up as a model
politician to all people. He described
how he had witnessed the railroads im
port contract laborers from Mexico.
Maguire's reception was not a lively
one. He was met just outside of the
town by an apology of a band and no
| committee was to be seen when he ar
| rived at the hotel. But two cheers
i were heard during his whole stay in
the town. The people are freely ex
; pressing their indignation at the idea
of having Maguire speak here in the
day time, when it is the most important
place In the county politically, and a
, partla.l canvass made to-night shows
i that this proceeding will be the means
of losing many votes to the Democratic
j cause.
RYAN AND BRUSIE
SPEAK AT AUBURN
AUBURN. CaL, Oct. 13.â Frank D.
Ryan. Republican nominee for Congress,
Second District, spoke to a large audi
ence to-night in the new City Hall. Bon
fires burned, the ba> â ' played and the
Flambeau Club pTa-.ftffl amid much en
thusiasm. Mr. Ryan discussed the issues
in a manner that carried conviction to
the minds of his hearers, and he was
frequently applauded. His reference to
the glorious war achievements of the
present administration was well-timed,
and the theory of protection and the
great benefits which it has brought to
the wool man and the lumber man struck
home. Mr. Ryan promised to treat the
farmer and the miner Impartially. He
was followed by Judson Brusle, who dis
coursed eloquently upon State and na
tional issues, and proved himself one of
the best speakers on the stump. Judging
from present indications Mr. Ryan will
get a Targe vote In Placer.
Fusionists Have an Organ.

JUDGE WARREN LEFT
A PECULIAR LETTER
CHICO, Oct. 13.â This morning the Coro
ner searched the papers of Judge C. Q.
Warren, who committed suicide yester
day, and found the following note to his
wife:
Dear Mary: You have been the best wife a
man ever had. For elpht years I have lived
a life in death. I feel that my mind is gone,
or polnp. I think I have lived long enoughâ
too long. In the last six months I have been
worse than ever before. I can be of no good,
I feel. Qood-by, darling Mary. God bless
you. Your loving husband, C. O. WARREN.

YET ANOTHER
PLATFORM IN
THE CAMPAIGN
Mr. Schmidt Frames
a Novelty.
OPPOSED TO POLL TAXES
DEMOCRATS ARRANGE A TOUR
OF THE COUNTY.
Independents Will Not in Any Way
Interfere With the State
Ticket of the Repub
licans.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Oct. 13.
Yet one more platform, containing nine
teen distinct "issues," has been placed be
fore the public. It is the document upon
which William J. Schmidt relies to place
him where he will have something to say
about the laws made by the next Legis
lature. Mr. Schmidt is an independent
candidate for the Assembly from the
Forty-ninth District. A. A. McKeon was
nominated at the Republican convention
for this office, and In addition to Mr.
Schmidt, John Teague is also making a
race for the Assembly. So many candi
dates rather complicate matters and if
they all go before the voters on election
day, there will be a chance for the Demo
cratic candidate to win. It is believed,
however, that all three men will not de
cide to make the race.
Two years ago Oscar Breiling was elect
ed by the Republicans In the Forty-ninth,
by a majority of about 500. F"our years
ago the two parties ran so close that
there was a contest and the Legislature
decided in favor of the Republican by one
vote.
Mr. Schmidt has concluded that some
thing new is needed to influence public
opinion, so he has issued a platform which
he says is not so long- as the State Re
publican platform nor so short as the
county declaration.
Schmidt eulogizes President McKlnley,
would like to see a Republican succeed
Stephen M. White, would abolish the poll
tax, would reduce probate fees and would j
entirely eliminate bosses from all kinds of j
conventions. He would also abolish one
of the Justice's courts of the city of i
Oakland. He declares that there are
28,000 persons in this county who are sub- !
iect to pay poll tax, and only 11,418 "that j
have been required to pay poll tax this
year â mostly poor people and employes i
of firms and corporations."
Mr. Schmidt's nineteenth declaration \
contains figures which are of more than ,
ordinary interest. It says:
Water companies furnishing water to the in- .
habitants of towns and cities for domestic use ,
j are required by law to present annually to the j
legislative body whoee duty it Is to fix the !
i water rates a sworn statement of the valut
\of their property and plant. In bo doing, the :
water companies are not slow to appreciate the i
fact that the greater the value they put upon
their works the greater will be the percentage
1 or income derived from their investment; hence
; such statements invariably show that the~water
companies have Invested fabulous sums In their
; works, so that the City Council or othi . mov
â  ernlng body will be Induced thereby to allow
! a reasonable rate of Interest upon their pre
. tended investment. The last sworn statement
i furnished by the two water companies of this
city fhow the property and plant of the Oak
land Water Company to be of the enormous
value of $5,500,000, while the last sworn state
ment of the Contra Costa Water Company
shown its property and plant to be of the valuta
of J5. '.00,000, making $12,000,000 as the valuation
of both companies. This sum of $12,000,000 con-
I stltutea the basis upon which water rates am
I imposed upon the people, and the sum upon
I which, as an Investment, a fair rate of inter
: est is allowed, as shown by the present exor
' bltant water rates.
It will be interesting for the people -who are
: required to pay water rates on an alleged to- I
1 vestment of $12,000,000 to know that the Oak- :
! land Water Company pays taxes only upon j
; an assessed valuation of $584,475. and that the i
i balance of the property of this company, to wit, j
l $4,915,525, escapes assessment and taxation. Also !
i that the Contra Costa Water Company pays :
â  taxes only upon an assessed valuation of $1,079,- 'â 
! 125, and of Its property as shown by Its sworn
i statement $5,420.57f> escapes assessment and
i taxation. The total amount thus escaping taxa
| tlon Is $10,335,400.
F. "W. Sawyer, the candidate for District
Attorney on the fusion and independent
tickets, says that his remarks at Lorln
I on Tuesday night had no reference what- i
I ever to Mr. Metcalf. He says he had no ;
i idea of attacking Mr. Metcalf, but ho j
: wished to impress his hearers with tht;
fact that the Congressional fight has i
nothing to do with the county fight, and
that although Mr. Metcalf should be
elected and the Republican county ticket |
fail of election, it would not necessarily
mean that Metcalf would thereby be at
a disadvantage in Congress.

PHELAN COMES IN
FGR A "ROASTING"
MUNICIPAL REFORM LEAGUE
NOMINATIONS.
Siebe for Assessor, Deane for County
Clerk, and Edward Holland for
Supervisor, First Ward.
The Munlcipa Reform League was
called to order yesterday afternoon at 2
o'clock at Its headquarters at 632 Market
street. Charles G. Nagle, the president
of the league, presided.
Various resolutions advocating public
improvements were read and adopted by
the league. The president then declared
nominations were in order.
John D. Siebe was, after a ballot, de
clared the nominee for Assessor. Wil
liam A. Deane was nominated for the of
fice of County Clerk. Edward Holland
was nominated for Supervisor from the
First Ward.
Speeches were then made on behalf of
various candidates, and some very severe
criticisms indulged in. Among the most
sarcastic was a speech by A. P. Murphy
of the Thirty-sixth District, who said:
"Some of the delegates yesterday were
full of sympathy for Mayor Phelan In
his lost fight, and called the chief execu
tive of the city n political wreck and said
he had the 'big-head.' ,
"The gentlemen made a mistake. There
is no man In the- city to-day better satis
fied with himself and his career than
James Phelan. He cares nothing for what
the people say tbout him, because when
he wants to see a great man above all
criticism he looks in the glass, and it
reflects Phelan. And thus wrapped up in
the consideration of his own virtues, and
gazing from the elevated plateau made
by Phelan bricks, surrounded by a Phelan
fence and painted with Phelan paJnt, he
surveys the weaklings beneath as at an
immeasurable distance, and, like a
woman, turns up his nose.
"The 'big head'? By the ghost of Julius
Caesar! He is the greatest man In the
three continents, that Is. regarding him
under Phelan's plug hat."
The league then adjourned until to-day.
PATTON A GREAT FAVORITE
A Series of Mass-Meetings Arranged
in Order to Satisfy the Popular
Demand.
That Charles L. Patton, the Republi
can candidate for Mayor, is gaining in
strength and popularity dally is now be
ing conceded by even the closest friends
of his opponent. It is the intention of
the managers of the local campaign to
bring this growing popularity to a cul
minating point by a series of popular
mass-meetings 10 be held each evening
next week, beginning on Monday even
ing. The demands for Mr. Patton's pres
ence at district gatherings have become
so numerous that it was found that the
only way in which they could be
satisfied was to arrange for central gath
erings in which voters from all parts of
the city could participate.
The first of the mass-meetings will be
held on Monday evening in Drew's Hall,
121 New Montgomery street. Mr. Patton
and D. A. McKinlay will be the principal
speakers of the evening, although many
of the candidates) on the local ticket will
also be present and will make brief ad- '
dresses. On Tuesday evening the same
speakers will address a mass-meeting at
Cyclery Hall at Haight and Stanyan
streets. On Wednesday evening they will
be the central figures at a grand mass
meeting to be hi:ld in Metropolitan Tem
ple. On that evening D. A. McKinlay
will make an extended address, an event |
that has been looked forward to with â 
great interest, r.s he is conceded to be
one of t^o most forceful stump speakers

LOUD AT REDWOOD CITY.
Will Join With D. A. McKinlay in
Addressing a Grand Mass-
Meeting To-Night.
Hon. Eugene F. Loud and D. A. Mc-
Kinlay will address a mass-meeting: of cit
izens at Redwood City to-night. Prepa
rations have been made for a great gath
ering, and it is expected that the meeting
will be one of the most successful of the
present campaign. Congressman Loud
intends to tell the voters of San Mateo
County the baro facts with reference to
the work done by Maguire In Congress,
and the story will no doubt be a reve
lation to many who have hitherto lis
tened to the tooting of the little pinto
giant's horn.
D. A. McKinlay will pay particular at
tention to Maguire and the single tax
question. He Is thoroughly familiar with
his subject, and will make some inter
esting revelatiors concerning the motives
that actuate Maguire and his single tax
lieutenants.
Taxpayers' Club.
The South Park Taxpayers' Improve
ment Club held a meeting last night at
211 Third street, M. J. McÃride presid
ing. The president in stating the object
oÂ£ the meeting gaid that the time had ar
rived when it â¢'vas absolutely necessary
that some change should be made in the
letting of contracts by. the terms of
which the rich man was protected and
the poor man anubbed, all to the ulti
mate benefit of the contractor.
The following named officers were elect
ed: A. L. Baker, president; J. B. Evans,

Colored Citizens Indorse Patton.
The Colored Citizens' Equal Rights
Union League met at 765 Market street
Wednesday night. Words of good cheer
were spoken by many of those present,
after which the president advised that the
time was fast approaching when steps
should be taken In reference to the in
dorsement of th-3 club's choice of the dif
ferent municipa. offices. The evening's
business consisted of the indorsement of
Hon. Charles L. Patton for Mayor and

PATTON UNANIMOUSLY
INDORSED FOR MAYOR
CHOICE OF THE UNITED LABOR
PARTY CONVENTION.
Several Republican Nominees for Su
pervisors and School Directors
Were Also Indorsed.
Charles L. Patton, the Republican nom
inee lor Mayor, received the unanimous
Indorsement of the United Labor Party
convention last night. It is the aim and
object of the United Labor party to nom
inate or Indorse the best men for office.
The merits of the candidates who have
been already named by other conven
tions are discussed by the investigating
committee of the party, and only those
are indorsed who are believed to be
worthy of support at the polls on election
day.
The friends of Boss Phelan worked hard
to secure his indorsement, but the com
mittee, after due deliberation, concluded
that the Interest of the city would be best
subserved by the election of Mr. Patton.
The fact that he has never before been
actively engaged in politics and that he
did not have any "sideshow," like the so
called Non-Partisan convention, to make
a fight for him. adds greatly to the j
strength of his indorsement. That the in- j
vestigatlng committee acted wisely in its I
choice between Boss Phelan and Mr. Pat- ;
ton was evidenced by the unanimous vote
of the convention in favor of the latter.
The convention also indorsed D. J. j
Murphy for District Attorney, Edward j
Holland for Supervisor of the First Ward,
Howard Black for Supervisor of the I
Third Ward and Dr. Josef F. Manson. I
Edward Head and E. H. Gedge for School i
Directors.

FIRE FUMES
Watchman Aldridgels
Saved From Death.
RESCUED BY BRAVE FIREMEN
HE HAD ALMOST GIVEN UP
HOPE OF SAFETY.
A Blaze in a Machine Shop on Mis
sion Street Threatens the De
struction of an Entire
Block.
A fire, which for a time promised to
destroy an entire block, was discovered
In the millwright establishment of M.
O'Brien at 511 Mission street shortly af
ter 12 o'clock last night. The adjoining
buildings, which are fur the most part
occupied by iron-work shops and the
dwelling houses immediately in the rear,
were In danger and had the flames not
been quickly conquered then? would have
been loss of life. As it was, a watch
man in the O'Brien establishment nar
rowly escaped death by smothering.
The blaze was discovered by Patrick
Kelly, a special officer on the block, and
he aroused the people In the neighbor-
Hood. Orville Aldridge, watchman for
O'Brien, was sleeping In the third story
of the machine shops, He was awakened
by the crackling of the flames and the
smell of smoke and attempted to make
his escape from the- building by meant of
the stairs, but before reaching the exit
he was overcome by the smoke and fÂ»-U
to the floor. Recovering himself he made
his way to a front window where, half
smothered, he hung until the men on
Truck No. 1 raised a ladder and rescued
him. Vk'hen discovered by the tlremen he
was hanging out of the window head
down, and it looked each moment as if
he would fall. He was take^ to a res
taurant across the street in a hulf-con
scious condition, but soon recovered.
The origin of the fire is not known, but
it started In the workshop in the rear of
the O'Brien building. From there It spread
to the steam pump factory of A. L. Fish
next door and the Oakland Iron Works
at 110 First street All of these places
were damaged by tire, smoke and water.
The entire loss is estimated by Captain
Comstock at from JWjOO to $lo,0"0.
The people living in the houses on Minna
street in the rear of the burn-
Ing buildings were aroused and moved
their effects from their homes, but none
of these buildings were touched by the
flames. W. A. Bummell, living at 112 First
street, was awakened by Patrick Nugent
and removed his wife and two children,
who were considerably frightened and
slightly affected by the smoke which
filled their rooms.

the palace, as previously cabled. With
the King and Queen were the German
Embassador to Italy, Baron Saurmavon
Jeltsch; General Pellaoux, the Italian Pre
mier and Minister of the Interior, and
Admiral Canervaro, the Minister of For
eign Affairs of Italy, together with the.
principal Italian local authorities and
. "inmanders of the German warships in
those waters. The meeting between the
royal and imperial couples was of the
most cordial nature. Emperor William
kissed the hand of the Queen of Italy and
King Humbert kissed the hand of the
Empress of Germany. The Queen and
Empress embraced each other.
While the met ting was in progress
massed military bands played the na
tional anthems.
The Emperor and Empress, accom
panied by King^ Humbert and Queen Mar
garet, were rowed to the palace i:i the
State gondola by way of the Grand Ca
nal. The Emperor and the King occu
pied one gondola and the Empress and
the Queen were seated In another. These
boats wore escorted by eight municipal
s richly ornamented and followed
bj a great lot Ma of gondolas.
After lun< heon at the palace, the Em
peror and Empress of Germany boarded
the Imperial yacht Hohenzollern and at 4
o'clock this afternoon sailed for Constan
le, conveyed by the German second
class cruiser Hertha. The warships In
p. nt saluted the Hohenzollern and the im
perial travelers were n peatedly cheered
by the crews as the yacht went to sea.
PLAYS ENGLAND'S
GAME AGAINST FRANCE
Emperor Menelik Positively Befuse'l
to Go to Marchand's Belief at
Tashoda.
ROME, Oct. 13.â The Tribuna will pub
lish to-morrow a letter from Aden on the
Bubject of Major Marchand'B expedition.
Marchand went to Fashoda expecting to
find Frenchmen or at least Abyssiniana
thi re In accordance with the plans of. M.
Lebon and M. Bonvallot, and incorrect
reports of Colonel Lugarde. On arriving
in Fashoda he sent emissaries to Abys
sinia by way of Kerin, but received no
reply. He then pent a. communication
to his Government by way of Cubaghi
;i.:ul Congo, asking for instructions and
stating ili.-it he had occupied thia most
unsatisfactory position because It com
ded the road to Varva. by which his
collaborators were fxpectcd to arrive,
and otherwise it would have been more
advantageous to have taken up a posi
tion at the confluence of the Sohat and
the Nile.
The correspondent of the Tribuna de
clares this was the plan which has failod
and which can no longer be carried out.
Emperor Menelik is doing his utmost to
>it its realization, and the Qngllsb
have cut off the line of supplies. it only
remains for Marchand to go down the
White Nile to Cairo. According to the
Tribuna's correspondent, French influ
ence in Ethiopia has received a fatal blow
as regards the Nile, Negus openly play
ing Kngland'a game against France.
JONES REPORTS ON
THE INDIAN TROUBLES
The Commissioner Says They Can Be
Settled With a Little Time and
Patience.
WASHINGTON. Oct. 13.â The follow
ing- dispatch about the Indian troubles,
dated Walker, Minn., late last night.
whs received at the Interior Depart
ment this morning:
"Secretnry of Interior: I have just re
turned from the hostile camp, about
twenty-five miles from here, where I
went this morning- with Father Aloysius.
About ninety Indians were present. I
am firmly of the opinion that the trouble
can be settled peaceably with a little time
and patience. W. A. JONES,
"Commissioner of Indian Affairs."
CHINA'S EMPEROR
REPORTED DYING
Empress Dowager Isolates Him and
Prepares to Assume the Re
gency.
LONDON, Oct. 14.â The Peking corre
spondent of the Times says: The foreign
legations have not yet been notified by
the Tsung-li-Yamen that the Empress
Dowager has assumed the regency, which
daily assumes more the nature of a
usurpation. There are ominous indica
tions and the early death of the Emperor
is expected.
An official of the Tsung-11-Yamen says
the Emperor lies in a dying condition in
a small building on a lake near the Em
press Dowagers palace, where no man
can penetrate.
NEXT CONVENTION
COMES TO THIS CITY
â 
House of Deputies Approve of the
Selection Made by the Epis
copal Bishops.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 13.â San Fran
cisco was to-day definitely determined
upon as the place for holding the next
triennial coum-il of the Episcopal
church. The House of Bishops took ac
tion in this direction yesterday, but the
House of Deputies sent the question
over until this morning. The subject
came up on a report by a joint com
mittee favorable- to San Francisco.
Rev. Edward D. Spulding of Califor
nia spoke of the important changes ma
turing on the Pacific Coast, the ad
vance of the Japanese against the bar
riers of the Chinese, the annexation of
Hawaii and the probable acquisition of i
the Philippines. Instead of being the
far Western diocese, Mr. Spalding said,
amid laughter, California was now in
the middle of the United States, and
with our country stretching across the
Pacific it would .soon be an Eastern dio
cese. There was but little opposition,
and on a viva voce vote the resolution
selecting San Francisco prevailed.
An interesting report, showing the
prosperous condition of the general
Theological Seminary in New York
City, was submitted by Rev. Dr. Carey.
It showed contributions amounting to
$450,000 from eleven dioceses during the
past three years, the chief Ttlon com
ing from New York. Large bequests
had been received, valuable acquisi
tions have been made to the library
and other valuable additions to its
equipment received.
Among the resolutions presented and
referred were those proposing a memo
rial to Congress for an amendment to
the Federal constitution providing for
uniform laws on marriage and divorce;
â¢ xtending the causes on which coad
jutor Bishops may decide; providing
for a deputation to attend the general
synod of the Church of England In Can
ada. The last resolution was adopted
unanimously, showing that the ten
dency is toward uniting the church.
The consideration of the constitution
was resumed, and article X of the re
vision, providing strict limitations on
alterations of the prayer-book, was
adopted unanimously.

dent McKinley was driven to the station,

A gentleman, whose business is a constant strain upon
his nerves, relates that one night recently he was unable
to sleep. On previous occasions he had observed a bene-
fit arising from the use of Ripans Tabules. On this
particular occasion, believing that heroic measures were
necessary, he took three. The result was really surpris-
ing. The effect was as quieting as though the medicine
had contained a narcotic, which every one knows it does
not. There was an immediate feeling of ease, rest and
quiet, extending in a few minutes over the entire system^
and sleep came as naturally as to a child.

MfIRS ON A JAMBOREE.
HAWAII must be glad that it is a part of the
United States. It must joy the heart of the
islander to realize that the benign influence of
a broadening civilization has taken him in, and that
the armed men of a great republic are on the spot to
shield him from all harm.
It is true that the armed men have not behaved
with absolute propriety. They have prodded the in
nocent thoughtlessly with a patriotic bayonet, have
raided private grounds, and latterly have indulged in
a spree of magnitude. These incidents, however, are
trilling.
Judged by a civilian code the officers, their scope
of vision enlarged and possibly distorted by an
overplus of alcohol, who declared Honolulu un
der martial law, should have been thrown into the
calaboose, &nd the next day fined as common drunks.
A different code may prevail in the army.
If the military authorities are at a loss as to how
the offenders should be punished, let them consider
the case reversed. Had a lot of citizens gone on a
tear, insulted and assailed the troopers, clubbed them,
used unseemly language having the distinct savor of
vulgarity, indignation would run riot. Generals
would have had conniption fits, messages would
have been hurried to the Secretary' of War, and ser
ried ranks gone forth to belt manners into the
criminals. With all respect for the soldiers, with a
tendency to glory in their devotion and their worth,
it must be admitted that there are times when their
deportment incites to remarks not wholly laudatory.
THE FREE -MARKET.
UNLESS the Board of Harbor Commissioners
concludes to do something toward establish
ing a free market upon the bay front before
the ses>ion of the Legislature begins in January, the
appointment of a committee to investigate and re
port the whys and wherefores of the neglect of that
body will be in order. The act authorizing the es
tablishment of a free market was approved by the
Governor on March 29, 1897, yet after eighteen
months of preparation all the Harbor Commis
sioners have done is to declare their intention (July
13, 1898) of making provision for the arrival of
produce by water.
It is not difficult to discern the cause of the de
lays which have taken place in establishing this free
market. The interests of a large number of business
men now engaged in handling the farm produce con
sumed by the people of this city are opposed to a
change of system, and their influence has been ex
erted to nullify an act of the Legislature. Up to the
present time the establishment of a free market has
been thwarted by disputes as to where, how and when
the innovation shall commence. The purpose is to
delay matters until the Legislature meets, when a de
termined attempt will be made to shelve the whole
project.
This, however, can scarcely be done. The principle
behind a free public market for San Francisco is too
great to succumb to any such assault. The teamsters
and hackmen of 1862-64 objected to the construction
of the Central Pacific Railroad. They called it the
"Dutch Flat swindle," and on one occasion organized
a mob and tore up its track?. They understood
merely that railroads were a menace to their busi
ness and they were therefore "against" them.
So it will turn out with the San Francisco free
market. The commission men no doubt clearly dis
cern in it a menace to their business, and no doubt
its establishment will force them to abandon the
present system of receiving and disposing of farm
produce in this city. But, nevertheless, the free mar
ket will ultimately overcome them, and the best they
can do is to meet it half way. In granting the ap
peals for delay and magnifying the obstacles which
stand in tfi^path of the enforcement of the act of
March" 29, 1897, the Harbor Commissioners are
merely prolonging the agony of the commission men.
Their dissolution willbe all the harder the more vig
orously the attempts to sgve them are prosecuted.
The enlightened course for all hands to pursue in the
matter is to unite in the prompt launching of the
market and its development as a permanent feature
of the business life of the city.
According to the evening papers of Wednesday 100
men had been killed in a labor riot in Illinois. Ac
cording to the morning papers of the next day, ham
pered as they were by facts, this figure had shrunk to
a mere eleven. It may thus be observed that an
evening paper has advantages.
The Cuban Colonial Government is not only set
ting free the worst class of criminals, but it remains
free itself.
San Francisco has weighed Mayor Phelan. Per
haps had the city merely "hefted" him he would have
passed. >
THE HOME AT DECOTO.
A NOBLE work, planned in loving charity for
the widow and the fatherless, and munificently
carried out in a spirit of broad liberality and
untiring energy, has been accomplished by the Ma
sonic Order in the opening of the massive and beau
tiful home at Decoto. The occasion was rightly
m*de one of grand ceremonial and celebration. It
marked the accomplishment of a work whose good
effects will continue from generation to generation
and increase in beneficence with the passing years.
It is significant of the energy with which the pro
moters of the charity urged it forward that the men
who took the lead in beginning the movement had
the satisfaction of seeing its completion. Rabbi
Voorsanger, who had the privilege of delivering the
address at the laying of the cornerstone, had also the
honor of making the oration at the formal dedica
tion of the finished building to the work for which it
was designed. In the spirit of the two addresses
there was something of the eloquence of action as
well as words, for Dr. Voorsanger was one of the
foremost and most earnest workers in the task of
providing ways and means for the construction of the
edifice, and shares with his fellow trustees the honor
that is due for a great task greatly accomplished.
Other of the early movers in the enterprise had the
satisfaction of sharing with Dr. Voorsanger in the
honors of the dedication day. Prominent among
these were Past Grand Master Edward Meyers Pres
ton, who aided in the primary work of providing for
its construction, and Thomas Flint Jr., who as
grand master of the order in California received it
from Charles L. Patton, .chairman of the board of
trustees, who, like them, had shared the respon
sibilities of the undertaking from first to last.
Nor is it to men only that praise for the home is
due. The aid of benevolent and energetic women
was cordially given to the work, and two of these.
Mrs. Frank Pierce and Dr. Edna Field, received
from the orator of the day the pubhc commendation
which their services merited.
Thus, with every circumstance of good fortune
and of gratification, the work so splendidly planned
and so nobly carried on has been brought to this
stage of completion. Out of the prospects that now
glow around it the brightest auguries can be drawn
of its growth and development. It takes its place
among the great benevolent institutions of which
California has a right to be proud, and which will
stand to attest to future ages the quality of her civili
zation, her religion and her humanity of to-day.
THE PORTY OF CONFUSION.
WHILE the Democratic conventions of nearly
all States west of the Alleghenys have re
affirmed the declarations of the Chicago plat
form of two -years ago, and have declared their un
shaken devotion to the cause of free silver and the
candidacy of Bryan, it is to be noted that in some of
the larger States on the Atlantic coast a different
course has been pursued. In New York, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania and Connecticut the silver plank has
been ignored in Democratic platforms, and the gifted
Bryan has received no indorsement.
In this condition of affairs it becomes the duty df
intelligent voters to consider what would be the re
sult of the election of a Democratic majority to the
House of Representatives. What could such a
body of divided factions accomplish in the way of
legislation? What could it effect in the settlement
of any single one of the great problems the next
Congress will be called upon to solve?
A vote for a Democratic Congressman in this
campaign is simply a vote for confusion. It cannot
be regarded by intelligent men as a vote for any
definite policy whatever. A party whose conventions
in such great States as New York and Pennsylvania
reject free silver could not be relied upon to provide
for free silver coinage even if it had a majority in
both houses of Congress and the Presidency as well.
Neither can a partr whose conventions in all the
Western States declare for fiat money in one form or
another be relied upon to settle the currency problem
either wisely or unwisely.
A vote for a Democratic candidate for Congress
under such circumstances is something worse than a
vote thrown away. It is an evidence that the voter
has little or no regard for the national welfare, and
no fixed principle of political action. He can hardly
be accounted a good citizen who at this juncture,
when so many grave problems are pressing for solu
tion upon the statesmanship of the nation, would de
liberately vote for chaos and confusion, and yet a
vote for the candidates of the fused factions of Dem
ocracy and Populism would mean nothing more than
that.
The Republican party can appeal to the voters in
this campaign for support not only upon the ground
that its policies are the better adapted to the needs
of the country, but upon the further ground that it
is the only party that has a policy at all. It is the
only party capable of agreeing upon any plan of
action. It is, therefore, the only party which can
possibly carry on the government. To vote against
it is to vote for something very much like anarchy
in the House of Representatives.
AN UNJUST PROVISION.
NO one will question the acumen and probity of
Judge de Haven. Therefore his decision that
a postmaster must make good the stealings of
a subordinate, confirming as it does a previous de
cision by the Circuit Court, will be accepted as in ac
cord with the law. There will also be at once an im
pression that the law is bad in effect, and in prin
ciple unjust.
If a postmaster had the appointing of his subor
dinates, the case would be far different. Then the
responsibility would be upon him morally as now it
seems to be legally. As a matter of fact, the post
master is helpless to shield himself against the pecu
lations of a rogue who may be an employe under
him. He has to accept such material as he finds,
and in the desire to weed out the worthless and dis
honest is baffled by civil service regulations.
Many times an employer may properly be held
responsible for the acts of an employe, but this cir
cumstance supplies no analogy. An employer is not
obliged to keep in his service any person he knows
to be unfit or concerning whose honesty he enter
tains suspicions. When William J. Bryqfn was Post
master one of his clerks stole a sum which, with in
terest, amounts now to about $10,000. According to
the ruling of the courts Mr. Bryan, who was in no
manner culpable, and who had no power to prevent
the theft, will have to make good the deficit. A
clerk in the postoflfice should at least be required to
give a sufficient bond and be held accountable for
his own misdeeds. This particular clerk did go to
jail, but the same rule which mulcts the Postmaster
would if consistently applied have sent the Post
master to jail along with the thief.
In the matter of extraordinary suicides the lowa
woman who killed herself by eating spiders is easily
entitled to whatever glory there may be in going to
the head of the class.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 14, 1893.
METHODS OF TAXATION.
1 ;OF several years there has been much discus-;
sion, in the older Eastern States, of the methods
* of taxation by which the public revenues are de
rived for the support of the State and municipal gov
ernments.
In New York nearly thirty years ago an able com- j
mission was appointed to consider and report upon |
this subject. Its report is a discussion, from a purely
scientific standpoint, of the different methods of tax
ation, and their relative economy in operation,
Much space is given to a complete exposition of a
tax on realty as a substitute for all other forms of
taxation. This exposition involves no denial of the ,
right of private ownership and no proposition to con
fiscate land by seizing its total annual rental value by j
the State. Land titles are not assailed and private
ownership is respected and confirmed. The matter
is again undergoing newspaper discussion in that j
State, because of attempts to increase the tax burdens
of personal property, which have caused the exodus
of much of that form of property to other States.
The State of Pennsylvania has a venerable and well
seasoned system of taxation, by which land and all
individual taxables escape the payment of State tax
entirely. Taxation for State purposes rests almost
wholly upon corporations, except mortgages and
bonds held by individuals, but three-fourths of the
tax derived by the State from these is re
turned to the counties to lighten the load
of local taxation. In Pennsylvania the en
tire tax for the support of the State govern
ment rests upon a bonus on charters; the capital
stock of corporations; on interests in limited part
nerships and joint stock associations; on corporate,
county and municipal loans; on the gross recerpts
of transportation, transmission, and electric light
companies; on the stock of banks; on the gross
premiums of domestic insurance companies having
capital stock, and on premiums of foreign insur
ance companies; on the net earnings of brokers, pri
vate bankers, unincorporated banks and savings in
stitutions; on the matured stock of building and
loan associations; an excise on the receipts of ex
press companies, and on escheats. Under this sys
tem land pays no State tax at all.
County taxts are based on a triennial assessment.
and are levied an all houses, lands, lots and ground
rents, mills and manufactories of all descriptions, all
furnaces, forges, Woomeries, distilleries, sugar and
malt houses, breweries, tan yards and ferries; on
personal property consisting of horses and cattle ex
ceeding four years of age; on all offices and posts of
profit, professions, trades and occupations, and all
freemen above 21 years of age who follow no pro
fession or calling. So much of the real estate of
public corporations as may be necessary to the exer
cise of their corporate franchises is exempt from
all county and local taxation. The tracks, depots and
rolling stock of railroad companies are exempt from
local taxation. Borough and municipal taxation in
cludes licenses on vendors. A very noteworthy fea
ture of the license system is a graduated license,
which has been in successful operation since 1840.
It provides: That no person shall hereafter keep
any beer house, eating house, restaurant or oyster
celb.r. other than hotel? now authorized by law to
be licensed and kept, wherein beer, ale or other malt
liquor, or oysters, or other refreshments of any kind
whatsoever are dressed, prepared or sold, without
first applying for and obtaining a license from the
County Treasurer of the proper city or county and
for which the keepers thereof shall pay the sums an
nually hereinafter provided, to wit:
Class Sales. License.
8 $ 500 to $ 1,000 $ 5.00
7 1.000 to 2,000 10.00
6 2.000 to 3,000 12.00
5 3,000 to 5,000. 20.00
4 6,000 to 10/'OO 30.00
3 10,000 to 15000 75.00
2 1.'.n00 to 20,000 125. n0
1 20,000 and over 200.00
The brewers' license is also graduated from an
annual production of 1000 barrels, $250, to 300,000
barrels, $6000.
The distillers' graduated license runs from 50 bar
rels, $100, to 20.000 barrels, $2000.
The mercantile licenses run from sales of $5000,
$10, to sales of $4,000,000, $1000.
This system in Pennsylvania has proved so satis
factory that all attempts to change it have failed.
There are no longer controversies over it. The cor
porations make their returns and pay their State
taxes. Land and personal property and licenses sup
port the local governments. The question of taxa
tion is not in politics in that State.
An examination of this system might well be made
by the public authorities in California. It is a uni
form system, the same in all counties and municipali
ties of the same class, and is, therefore, desirable.
The system proposed in this State by amendment
No. 2 will dot the State with diverse and antagonistic
systems of taxation, which will render equalization
for the purposes of the State levy impossible.
J\A ARTIN F. FRAGLEY, the Republican nor
n/ \ inee for Superintendent of Streets, is not an
* â¢ unknown man to the people whose suffrages
he asks. As one of the leading contractors of the
city, he has been brought into business relations with
nearly all classes of citizens, and, moreover, the work
he accomplished while in charge of the House of
Correction made him kno"wn to all intelligent ob
servers of the conduct of our county affairs as one
of the best and most successful officials in our his
tory.
The record of Mr. Fragley's administration of the
House of. Correction, with its attendant farm, is in
deed one of which any man might be proud. He
displayed in that office not only an honest zeal for
the welfare of the institution under his charge, but
a degree of executive ability in the direction of its
affairs that enabled him to accomplish results of vast
benefit to the community. Under his management
the farm became a fruitful and profitable property.
He conducted it with a true economy, developed its
worth to the full value, and, in short, proved himself
to be a model administrator of municipal business.
For the office to which he has now been nominated
by the Republican party he is particularly well fitted
both by nntural disposition and by business training
and experience. No man in San Francisco has a
better understanding of street work, a greater ex
ecutive ability for the performance of it. or a more
public spirited interest in the maintenance of the
streets in good condition, where they are good, and
improving them where improvements are_needed.
It will be conceded that we need for the work of
Superintendent of Streets a practical man, one who
knows something of street construction, and who can
be reh'ed upon to attend to the work with honesty
and push it forward with vigor and energy. Mr.
Fragley is that kind of man. What he has done in
the past is a guarantee of the future. All who wish
good streets and good work should vote for him.
The time seems to be near for the Paris Peace
Commission to lay aside the olive branch and take up
a club. . j

Overhearing the murmur the Mayor

Yet was the disquiet of the multitude

WELLS IS LIKE
BRODERICK.
To the Editor of The Callâ Dear sir:
Every true citizen of this common
wealth should, before exercising his
privilege of suffrage, study the char
acter and reputatioÂ»*tÂ»f the respective
candidates before "the people for office.
The fact Is well known and universally
conceded that the office of Auditor .if
the city and county of San Francisco
is the most important and trustworthy
in the gift of the people. Through the
Auditor the demands for millions ' of
dollars are annually passed", and he
could, by a stroke of his pen, open the
door to the greatest of fraud. The
Auditor should possess the confidence
of the entire community. In him
should be found those sterling quali
ties of honesty and fearlessness in the
discharge of his duties. The finger of
scorn should have never been pointed
at him. Our prelcnt Auditor, William.
Broderick, is one of those few men
whom fear or favor never swayed. He
fulfilled his duties regardless of either,
and to-day stands foremost in the
ranks of those honest public officials
who are an honor to any community
in which they live. He was faithful
to his pledges and promises and his
retirement will be deeply felt by the
municipality. He was the Ideal of a
man one of our most popular authors
had in mind when he wrote: "True
aristocracy are the best men of the
country. Those ought to govern and
will govern some day, whether their
patent of nobility be birth and titles or
honesty and brains." Asa R. Weils,
the Republican nominee for Auditor,
is such another man. He has ably as
sisted in building up our common
wealth. His business career is an open
book. He is a candidate who can go
before the public fearless of his past
life being criticized. Can it be said so
of John H. Grady, the nominee of the
100 job chasers, whose record as Tax
Collector is too well known to make
mention of it here. The people who
placed him on the ticket did so know
ingly and it may be said with very lit
tle credit to themselves. The taxpay
ers on November 8, 1898, will resent the
insult and maintain the safeguard that
is at present stationed around the
treasury, in -the person of William Bod
erick, by electing Asa R. Wells to the
Auditorship. Let the voters picture to
themselves a business man on one
side, employing hundreds of men daily
for the past forty years, and on the
other a politician whose public career
was the subject of investigation by the
Grand Jury. The result will be an
overwhelming victory for Asa R. Weils
at the polls.

The trouble over the naval reserve
steamer Marion's berth at Howard-street
wharf baa broken out again. When there
Is a rush of shipping the Chief Wharfinger
wants to move the vessel out into ihe
stream, and Captain Turner, barked up
by Governor liudd, refuses tv have the
war vessel shifted. At the present time
it Is impossible to find dock roum for all
the vessels In port with cargoes to dis
charge, and In order to make room for at
least one deep-water ship Assistant < 'hief
Wharfinger Scott ordered the Marion Into
thf stream; but the Harbor Commission*
ers refused to back him up, and the Naval
Reserve still holds the fort.
When Uncle Sam presented the old
Bloop-of-war to the Naval It. servo th.re
was a great deal of wire-pulling over the
Question of where Bhe should be stationed.
P.'.n I tic-go wanted her, and. In fact, at one
time It was all settled to send her there.
San Francisco turned the tables, however,
and finally secured Â£he vessel. The Har
bor Commissioners were then appealed to,
and a permanent berth was assigned the
warship at Howard 3 wharf. When this
was secured the members of the Naval
Battalion save up their armory on East
street and moved, bag and baggage,
aboard the training ship. She was con
nected wi'h the electric light service of
the city and also with the telephone serv
ice, and the reserve boys soon began to
feel at home.
Just when everybody was comfortably
settled aboard the Marion and everything j
was moving like clockwork there came a
rush of shipping into port. Chief A\ narl
lnger Boot worked day and night to ac
commodate them, but failed, and then in
despair he ordered the Marion into the
stream The Harbor Commissioners j
agreed with him that the space was neces
sary to accommodate the commerce of the
port, and backed up the order. Then the
officers of the battalion appealed to Gov
ernor Budd, and pointed out that with
the Marion in the stream they would be
without an armory and everything neces
sary for carrying on the work of the re
serve Governor Budd saw the point, and
interceded with the Commissioners. The
result was that the Marion remained in
he That rl was the last of the matter until
about a week ago. The bay is now full
of shipping, and vessels are waiting two
deep for a chance to dock. Assistant
Chief Wharfinger Scott is on the move
from morning until night contriving ways
and means to give space to everybody,
but at last he came to the conclusion that
the Marion should be moved into the
stream. He explained the matter to the
Commissioners, and last Tuesday ; IT. â .* -
dent Colnon moved that the naval bat
talion be instructed to take the Marion
away from the wharf. Commissioners
Harney and Herrold thought it would be
better to lay the matter before the Gov
ernor before any action was taken.
This was agreed to, and to-day Messrs.
Colnon. Harney and He , rro i d will call
upon Mr. Budd and ask him that, as
commander-in-chief of the land and sea
forces of the State, he order the train
ing ship Marion moved into the stream
temporarily. The State's tug will move
the training ship away from the wharf
to-morrow, therefore, if the Governor
agrees, and will tow her back again
when the rush of business is over.

in the story that Captain Green was held
as a hostage at Kotzebue by indignant
gold hunters. Green went north with the
intention of going mining and did so All
who wished to return were brought back
on the barkentine and some people who
went up on Seattle vessels and were left
there were returned by the Northern

SCHEME EVIDENTLY INSPIRED
BY MR. HOSMER.
Latest Ruse of the Prosecution to
Secure Possession of Mrs. Bot
kin Was Considered
Frivolous.
The Supreme Court, sitting at Los An
geles, yesterday refused to recognize De
tective" Bernard McV'ey, accredited agent
for the State of Delaware, and declined to
consider for a moment a petition for a
writ of habeas corpus, which was laid
before the Court by Assistant District
Attorney Hosm.-r.
McVey's petition set forth that though
he had In his poaession extradition papers,
duly slgi.eu by Governor James H. Budd,
for the person of Mrs. Cordelia Botkin,
Chief of Police Lees of San Franaisco had
custody of the prisoner and refused to
give her up to the Delaware authorities,
though by virtue of his papers, he (Mc-
Vey) was rightfully and legally entitled
to possession of the prisoner.
Despite that one proceeding in habeas
corpus is pending in this city, Â£Ir. Hosnier
appeared before the court in the soutnern
city yesterday morning with Me\ ey s
petition. The Supreme Judges evidently
had knowledge of the writ, now pending
here for, after a short presentation of
his case. Mr. Hosmer was informed that
the petition would not be considered. He
was not given even the small satisfaction
of being told the court's reasons for. its
peremptory denial, and was so deeply cna-
Eniied at his failure that he made every
effort to keep the matter from becoming

CLUBBED A POLICEMAN.
The Assault Upon C. M. Barnes Being
Investigated by Judge Low.
The preliminary examination of John
Bulger and Walter Nagle on the charge
of assault with a deadly weapon waa com
menced before Judge Low yesterday af
ternoon. They are accused of striking
Policeman C. M. Barnes on the head at
Fifteenth and Mission streets in the early
morning of September 18 with some In
strument, inflicting an ugly wound, which
confined Barnes to St. Mary's Hospital
for two or threr> weeks. Barnes at the
time had a prisoner in charge, who
escaped.
The evidence of Barnes was corrobor
ated by Joseph Falbe and E. Campe, the
former testifying that he saw Bulger hold
a stick with both hands and strike Barnes
on the head with the heavy end. Police
men Connell, Ellis and Thompson testified
to Naffle having voluntarily confessed
that Bulger struck the blow, but claimed
that he (Nagle) was innocent.
The case for the prosecution was closed,
and the defense got a continuation until
next Wednesday.
THE RAILROAD HAS
ITS RIGHTS DEFINED
COMMISSIONERS CANNOT SEE
ITS BOOKS AND PAPERS.
Judge Seawell Outlines the Jurisdic
tion of the State Body in a De
cision Rendered Yesterday.
The Railroad Commission has met a
second defeat in its efforts to pry into
railroad affairs not within its Jurisdiction.
A few months ago Judge Bahrs enjoined
the Commission from further procedure
In the investigation of railroad matters
under the Robinson complaint. Yester
day Judge Seawell rendered a decision re
fusing the Commission a peremptory writ
of mandate requiring Joseph L. Willcutt,
as secretary of the Market-street Rail
way Company, to produce certain books
and papers for examination, that the
Commission might establish rates of
charges for the transportation of passen
gers over street railroads in the State.
"The State constitution provides," reads
the doeciElon, "that the Railroad Commis
sioners shall have the power and it shall
be their duty to establish rates of charges
for the transportation of passengers and
freight by railroad or other transporta
tion companies.
"Do the words 'railroad and other
transportation companies,' as used in the
section of tIM constitution, include street
railroad corporations?
"I would, in the absence of express
language, feel justified in Importing into
the constitution the distinctions of the
Civil Code. The word 'railroad 1 Is suffi
ciently comprehensive to include street
railroads unless the context, the purpose
which the framers of the constitution
had in view and the general policy of the
State in regard to the subject, show that
it was not their Intention in the section
under consideration to Include street rail
roads.
"The Legislature, at Its first session, aft
er the adoption of the present constitu
tion, passed an act providing that the
term 'transportation companies' should
be deemed to mean and include 'all com
panies owning and operating railroads
(other than street railroads) within this
State.* Until the commencement of these
proceedings this definition given by the
act has been acquiesced in by the Rail
road Commissioners, and they have never
attempted to exercise any jurisdiction
over street railroads."
The court, however, holds that it is for
the courts and not. the Legislature to de
fine the meaning of the words used In the
constitution, but finds also that the In
terpretation of the Legislature is the cor
rect one. " The agitation which led up to
the Insertion in the constitution of the pro
vision under consideration," the decision
further states, "was wholly in reference to
the fares and freights under considera
tion. There can be no doubt but that if
any constitutional provision had been
made for regulating the fares of street
railroads it would have vested the powers
within the municipalities within the limits
of which the railroads are." After further
considering various Issues and points
raised by counsel, the court holds that
there Is no merit in the application of the
Commission for a writ or mandate and a
refusal is ordered entered.

PURLOINED THE
DRESS OF THE
GIRL HE LOVED
Arrest of an Ardent
Wooer.
ANDREW ANZENE'S WOES
CHARGED WITH BURGLARY BY
LIZZIE BUCKLEY.
Because She Refused to Marry Him
He Broke Into Her Room and
Stole a Valuable Gar
ment.
Andrew Anaene, a love-stricken rancher
of Fort Bragg, la locked up In the City
Prison with a charge of bursary record
ed agralnst his name. Some time ago
Anzene met a young woman named Nellie
Buckley, also a resident of Fort Bragg,
and fell desperately in love with her.
His attentions became so obnoxious to
her that she decided to leave Fort BragÂ£
in the hope of getting rid of him. She
came to this city about six weeks ago
and rented apartments in a lodging house
at 118 Sixth street. Her ardent suitor fol
lowed her here, and learning h>.Â«r address,
he took a room in the fame house. Again
he begged her to become his wife, and
when she refused he threatened to kill
her.
Fearing violence at his hands Mis 3
Buckley moved to another house, expect
ing that Anzene would not follow her.
Scarcely had she unpacked her trunk
when Anzene appeared on the scene and
proceeded to annoy her with his atten
tions. In order to get rid of him the
woman secretly left the house and went
to visit a friend on Mission street. On
her return she was surprised to find that
her room had been entered during her
absence and her cloak and dress stolen.
Suspecting that Anzene had taken them
she sent for him and asked him for an
explanation.
He readily admitted his guilt, and prom
ised to return the articles. The following
day he sent the cloak and dress to Mi^s
Buckley with many apologies for having
taken them.
A short time afterward Mies Buckley In
closed $8 in a letter which was addressed
to a friend in Fort Bragg. She entrusted
the letter to the purser of the steamer
which runs to that place, with instruc
tions to deliver it. In some way Anzene
learned of the letter, and he schemed to
get possession of it. Taking passage on
the steamer he awaited the opportunity,
and finally pocured the letter. With tho
missive secreted in his inside vest pocket
Anz-jne n turned to this city and again
proceeded to make violent love to the ob
ject of his affections.
Failing to hear from the friend to whom
she had sent the money. Miss Buckley be
came anxious and hunted up the purser
of the steamer ;ind asked him if he had
delivered the letter. He informed her
that it bnd been stolen, but offered to re
fund the amount. Suspecting that Anzer.e
knew something about the theft of the
letter. Miss Buckley accused him of hav
ing taken it. With tears streaming down
his cheeks Anzene confessed that he had
stolen it. He explained that he thought
Miss Buckley was in love with the person
to whom the letter was addressed, and
being insanely jealous of her, he attempt
ed to set possession of the missive. Me
then handed the woman the amount he
had abstracted from the letter.
J.ast Wednesday night Miss Buckley
went for a walk, and on returning to her
room she found the window open. A
subsequent examination revealed that the
room had been entered and a valuable
dress taken. Anzene , was the culprit.
She visited police headquarters and swore
to a complaint charging him with bur
glary. Late yesterday afternoon Detec
tives Dillon and Anthony found Anzece
standing on the street looking up at the
window of the room occupied by Miss
Buckley. He was at once placed under
arrest "and tak-n to the City Prison,
where he was formally charged.

HONORED A FELLOW CLERK.
W. B. Fletcher Jr. Presented With a
Gold Match Box by Employes
of The Call Business Office.
W. B. Fletcher Jr., a clerk in The Call
business office, was presented with a
handsomely engraved gold match-box on
Monday last as a parting remembrance
from his fellow-workers. The recipient
of the gift severed his connection with
The Call a few days previous to the
presentation, as he intends leaving for
his home In Indianapolis and taking up
the study of art. During his two years'
service with The Call, by his kindly man
ners and accommodating ways, he has
won the esteem of his fellow-workers,
and when the news of his intended de
parture became known they decided to
?lve him a token of their regard. With
his object in view they all contributed
toward the purchase of the match-box,
and it was suitably engraved.
To W. N. Donaldson, superintendent or
the circulation department, was dele
gated the duty of making the presenta
tion speech. Monday was the day set,
and Mr. Fletcher was invited, to the office.
On his arrival his friends crowded
around him and after jesting with him
on various topics the surprise was
sprung. In presenting Mr. Fletcher with
the present Mr. Donaldson enumerated
his good qualities and eulogized him for
tho faithful and efficient services he ren
dered The Call during, hlÃ employment.
In receiving the match-box Mr. Fletch
er expressed surprise and delight, and in
a few fitting sentences thanked the don
ors anu assures them that he would ever
cherish it as a remembrance of the pleas
unt days passed among them.
In the evening a dinnf-r was given in
Mr F!etcher"s honor at the Grotto. Part-
Ing speeches were made and the evening
was spent in song and story.
"A Ragtime" Opera,
The present theatrical season seems, so
far as announcements are concerned, to
be very barren of new productions. This
applies more particularly to the large
field of entertainments not covered by the
legitimate stars, such as farcical comedies,
comic operas and extravaganzas, so. that
moat new offerings in the latter line may
be eyed with suspicion, but these condi
tions will not apply to such time-tried
comedians as Mathowa and Bulger. Their
latest venture is "a ragtime" opera en
titled. "By the Sad Sea Waves. 1 It Is
said to be well suited to the abilities of
this team of funniakors. They are con
sidered one of the season's most coveted
bookings and will appear at the Colum
bia in an engagement of two weeks, be
ginning Monday next.

FASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. Oct. 13 ThÂ« advance In prices
In to-day's stock market was even more signifi
cant of the improved tone of speculative senti
ment than that of yesterday. For one reason
this was true because quite a large short inter
est was eliminated from the market by yes
terday's advance. Another I fact that might
have been utilised by the bears was the de
pression in foreign markets so marked as to
suggest some knowledge of pending political
cations in the deeper financial currents.
Not only was this indicated by the heaviness
of securities, a fall of 5-16 in British consols
and of 15 centimes In French rentes, but the
excited condition of the foreign markets. The
opening in Wall street brought orders to pell
15.000 shares or upward of stock for Ixmdon
account. The bears ilia, in iact, avail them
eelves of this opening to make a drive against
Tobacco, Sugar and Northern Pacific, but the
confident manner in which all offerings, both
J"or London and for the short account, were
absorbed, took all the assurance out of them
and their only other aggressive move during
the remainder of the day was a drive against
Tobacco. The bears have counted much on
the damaging effects of the war in the sugar
refining industry, the conflict over the plug to
bacco trade and the reported divergence of
Ideas among the powers of Northern Pacific
preferred over the question of a dividend on
the common stock to check any advance in the
market on nceount of very favorable reports
of railroad earnings and the generally pros
perous outlook for business. The movements of
prices in securities gave warning of com
promises and adjustments and took away the
mainstay of the bear movement. The process
of covering short contracts therefore proceeded
on a large scale and large financial interests
offered aggressive support to the prices of
properties in which they were Interested. A
significant feature of the day's trading was the
Investment demand for small lots of gilt edge
stocks. There were conspicuous movements of
this port In St. Paul preferred. Pullman. Great
Northern preferred. Manitoba, Albany and
Eusquehanna, St. Paul and Omaha preferred
and Pennsylvania. The advance in Pullman,
Manitoba and Great Northern preferred ex
tended from 314 to 4% per cent, and Manitoba
closed with a bid T^j higher than last night.
This buying la a natural concomitant of the
(Trowing ease In the money market. Call loans
were made at 2 per cent to-day, and there is
a constant increase in the supply of money
offering 1 both for time loans and mercantile
paper. Short selling was slightly firmer in tone
In response to the advances in the Bank of
England rates. A small engagement of gold
for import was without influence on sentiment.
To-day's net gains equal a point for many
etocks.
The denial) for high grade bonds was a re
flection of the growng abundance of surplus
capital. Total sales, $2,005,000.
United States 3s, the old 4s registered and the
new 4s advanced % in the bid price. The 3s
coupon sold at- 105%, the highest yet.
The total Fales of stocks to-day were 306,400 !
shares. Including: Atchlson preferred, 3969; i
Burlington. 8956; Manhattan. 14,325; Northern !
Pacific, 43,6^; Northern Pacific preferred, 7650;

i generally, It is believed that politics Is the
cause of the rise in the rate, but I have rea

: endeavor to suppress a repetition of the growth >
of German financial bills in tills market. It

any linn tendency to-day. New York buying ;
has given general flip and prices closed quite

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Oct. 13.â Wheat opened quite
! strong at a sharp advance over last night, De
i cember starting lc higher at &U.@66%C For
i an hour the bulls were disposed to crowd their
1 advantage and bullish news came thick and
fast. It was noticeable, however, that the
! market was making little headway, and In view
I of its action yesterday there was a suspicion
|of further Improvement, but quiet selling.
I Though prices were higher the market did not
' have the same power of absorption that was
I a feature during the advance yesterday. The
fact that many people were overloaded acted
as a damper on the market. This claim was
as a rule disposed to sell on all hard spots.
Lord Roseberry'e warlike speech, an advance of
1,1,1^(1 at Liverpool, reported record-breaking
Bales of flour at Minneapolis (180,000 barrels),
nn advance of 10c per barrel in all leading
grades of flour, reported sales of 240.000 bushels
! of cash wheat here and reported continued cx
i port engagements at the seaboard all contributed
Ito the strength. After the first hor-'s trading
j the realizing natural to such an a ivance be-
I came too heavy for the market to sustain. The
market went back to Mifcc before it became
evident that it had been oversold. Covering
by shorts caused a rally to 6fÂ»c and very little
reaction from that figure followed. The close
for l>ecember was at an advance of Â£Â®%C on
There Was a big general trade in corn early.
The market in a general way sympathized with
wheat but was helped also by bullish country
advices and large export sales. December
E! Oats were strong all day. The Btrength of
wheat was the main factor. May advanced %c.
Provisions showed improvement, both In t<>mÂ»
an.l In the volume of trailing. Colder weather
In the South and the belief that the fever would
be checked was an incentive to buy and prices
advanced all around. The best prices were
not maintained, however, realizing being quite
free at times. The close was PA&PAfi higher
for the day.

EASTERN NUT MARKET.
NEW YORK, Oct. 13.â The Journal of Com
says: An unusually short supply of
nearly all supplies of foreign and domestic
production Is reported this year, and as a re
sult the market is strong, with an advancing
tendency. The California almond crop Is re
ported to be almost a complete failure this
year, and as there were no old goods carried
over the market both here and on the coast is
bare for the first time in a number of years.
The scarcity extends to shelled ?â¢>â >.!>= and is
particularly noticeable in Sicily, which are re
ported to be very difficult to obtain in any po
sition and are in active demand at rapidly ad
vancing prices. Jordan shelled do r. -I seem so
scarce as other varieties, but are held firmly,
though not moving very freely. In the walnut
market conditions are closely analogous to
those prevailing In almonds.

PHOTOGRAPHING ANIMALS.
I ."One of the most difficult brutes to pho
j tograph is the monkey," said a man in
j New York, who makes a business of tak
i ing the pictures of all sorts of animals
and birds, to a Star reporter. "You may
' try as much as you like, but you will nev
ier succeed in making a monkey look
1 straight into the center of a camera for
even a second. Its glance always shifts
i off to one side of the other. Nor will it
ever catch your eye full or fix its own
upon yours, and I have come to the con
clusion that a monkey cannot look at a
camera any more than it can a human
being in the face.
"Take a dog's head in your two hands
and look into its eyes. The beast will re
turn your gaze, not for long perhaps, for
the contemplation of human intelligence
distresses all animals. But it is not so
with the monkey. Hold its head as pa
tiently as you please between your hands,
and it will cast its eyes up to the ceiling
and keep on winking or cast them down
to the floor as if asleep or twist them
around in a most absurd fashion to look
over to one side or the other, but never,
even passing by it, will it catch yours.
"Why is this? I don't know, unless it
Is that the animal has some secret regard
ing our own origin that it does not wish
us to find out. However, if they are bash
ful, they are, very inquisitive, and if I
were to leave . my camera unguarded for
ten minutes in a cage containing: a dozen
monkeys half the family would be busy
taking photographs of the other half."â

BOND ELECTION
HAS ALMOST
BEEN BURIED
Park Matter to Be
Determined.
ADAMS POINT IS OFFERED
ONLY TWO WEEKS FROM THE
PUBLIC VERDICT.
Three Hundred and Twenty Thou
sand Is the Amount Involved
in the Three Park
*v Propositions.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Oct. 13.
So much interest has been directed to
ward the general election that the fact
has almost been lost sight of that there
is to be a bond election two weeks from
next Saturday. This election is for the
purpose of testing public opinion regard
ing the expenditure of $32^.000 for park
purposes. This matter has been before
the public for over a year, and the great
Interest it aroused when it was first
broached has almost subsided, and but
little is heard of the election.
Out of this amount of $320,000 Adams
Point is to be purchased and improved at
a cost of $290,000, West Oakland park is to
be improved to the extent of $20,000 and
Independent square Jn East Oakland is to
have $10,000 spent upon it.
The section of the Adams tract which 13
submitted to the voters consists of sixty
two acres, being the southerly portion of
what is known as Adams Point. It has a j
frontage on the lake of 5275 feet and tho j
northern boundary consists of a broad
driveway with a frontage of 3500 feet.
One portion of the park consists of a
grove of 125 large oak trees.
These bonds will run for forty years
and will bear 4 per cent interest. One
fourth of the entire amount will be re
deemed at the end of each ten years.
The property north of the tract offered
to the city is laid off into residence lots
and many wealthy people have recently
erected splendid mansions upon it. If the
land be purchased for a park It will be
necessary to build a bridge from the foot
of Alice or Jackson street reaching to the
new park, co that it will be easily acces
sible without making a trip around the
northwest arm of the lake.
WILL DID NOT SUIT HER.
Mrs. Marrianna Louis Loses Her
Contest Over the Estate
of Her Son.
OAKLAND, Oct. 13.â R. B. Tappan, at
torney fur the estate of the late Edouard
Louis, appeared before Judge Hall to-day
and submitted the will which Mrs. Marri
anr.a Louis, contestant mother of the de
ceased, contended was of more recent
date than the one filed by the widow for
probate.
The instrument wj.s quite a revelation,
{or -in the first place, it had been drawn
up in ISBB, and secondly, by its provisions, ;
:.Ure estate was left to the widow, i
whereas the aged contestant is bequeath- '
ed but $8.
It had been claimed by contestant that
this will had been kept In hiding by the !
widow but when she learned its contents
to-day all hopes to break the will of her
son forsook her.
Mrs. Edouard Louis, the widow, though
legally freed from contributing to
the support of her mother in law, has
promised to allow her $25 monthly, pro
vided she withdraws her suit.

Whole House Was Soaked.
OAKLAND, Oct. 13.â There was a lively
blaze at 836 Broadway this morning. On
the roof of the third story of that num- I
ber was a frame structure used as a j
laundry and in one of the rooms a red hot |
stove ignited clothing hanging about to
dry, and In a very snort time the entire
wooden structure was a mass of flames.
The Fire Department responded promptly
but its only utility was to prevent the
. fire from spreading to the main building.
Owing- to the clogged gutters a large
amr>ant of water accumulated on tne
rool and, soaking through, injured carpets,
bedclothing and furniture to considerable
extent. The building is occupied by
Mrs. Georgia Smith as a lodging house.
. The exact amount of loss Is not known.
Saved Her Father's House.
OAKLAND. Oct. 13.-Miss Nelda Fisher
by her presence of mind last night saved
the residence of her father, P. M. Fisher,
from what might have been a serious
conflagration. Early in the morning the ;
â¢ explosion of an overturned lamp started
a blaze that required some lively work
to extinguish, and In the evening a cur
tain was discovered to be on fire. The
young lady bravely tore away the burn-
Ing curtain from its fastenings and thrust
It Into a bucket, preventing further seri
ous damage.

THE FACULTY AND
STUDENTS AT PEACE
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS ABE
THOROUGHLY ESTABLISHED.
Freshmen Show a Flag of Truce, the
Faculty AcceptÃ Hostages and
Harmony Reigns.
BERKELEY, Oct. 13.â The concluding
episode in the recent "rush" trouble at
the University of California has occurred
to-day. The difficulty is now permanently
settled and in a manner which, without in
the least compromising tne authority of
the faculty, leaves the student body per
fectly satisfied and well disposed toward
the powers that be.
The solution of the whole trouble was a
master stroke of policy upon the part of
the students' affairs committee. They had
it in their power to inflict upon the men
that rushed the severest penalty a col
lege student can suffer. They also faced
the necessity of administering some sort
of discipline to prevent a future breaking
of the faculty's rules. The course they
have adopted avoids altogether the grave
results of expulsion which it was feared
might ensue, and at the same time it puts
all further campus tussels on the part of
the students out of the question.
The students' affairs committee, consist
ing of Professors Thomas R. Bacon, Wil
liam Carey Jones and George C. Edwards,
have been carrying on their investigation
ever since the last rush occurred They
have summoned before them in all about
fifty students, freshmen, sophomores and
Juniors, whom they had reason to suspect
were in any way connected with the feud.
While they found several who had taken
part in the affair, they could not fix the
responsibility upon any in particular. Ac
cordingly they have chosen from out of
the three lower classes representative men
whose influence and example could pre
vent a rush, if such an occurrence seemed
imminent. These men have been taken
on as hostages with the understanding
that if any more outbreaks happen they
shall suffer immediate expulsion from the
university. i t-.-'**.
The names of the students who thus

from the position in which these men
would be placed, should such a thing oc
cur, the whole sentiment of the student
body is now strongly opposed to the old
custom. The traditional interclass rush
at the university has therefore become
distinctly a thing of the past, and its re
appearance in Berkeley will probably
never be known again.
Whitewashed the Soldiers.
BERKELEY, Oct. 13.â The second foot
ball match between the University of
California and the Washington Volun
teers was played this afternoon upon the
university campus. From the start it
was clear that the game would be one
sided. The army men played hard, but,
although superior in weight, could not
stand before the trained work of the col
lege team. Berkeley scored altogether
eight touchdowns; five in the first half
and three in the second. The score at
the close stood 44 to 0 In favor of the
university.

MEADORS IS
CONTRADICTED
BY WITNESSES
But the Defense Gains
a Point.
URY'S SLAYER IS ON TRIAL
TESTIMONY BEING TAKEN BY
THE PROSECUTION.
Liquor Was Liberally Drunk on the
Night Before the Fatal Stab
bing Affray at Camp
Barrett.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Oct. 13.
Attorney Eugene Deuprey, on behalf of
the defense in the James N. Meadors
murder trial, this afternoon gained one
important point as to the admissibillty
of certain testimony relating to the cir-
cumstances on the night prior to the stab
bing of Jonas Ury, which the defense con
siders of much weight as leading up to
the cutting.
Eugene Dirkam of Company C, to which
Meadors and the murdered Ury belonged,
was on the witness stand, and Attorney
Deuprey on cross-examination asked
whether or not Ury was drunk on the
night of August 15, and whether or not
he had caused the "muss" in the tent
over which the subsequent quarrel arose
and over which the lie had been passed.
Deputy District Attorney Melvin stoutly
objected to the questions. He said he
could not see how the lie could have been
passed when Meadors was not present.
Moreover, the point he considered imma
terial. Judge Ellsworth, however, al
lowed Deuprey to proceed, and the wit
ness to answer, remarking: "Before we
get through with the trial the whole facts
of any quarrel will probably come before
the jury."
Witness Dirkam then responded that
the men in the tent had been drinking
liquor liberally on the night in question.
As to the "muss" in the tent he said: "I
first accused Burnett, and he accused
Ury. Then when Meadors appeared he,
too, said it was Ury- Ury then told him
he lied and that he was a liar."
Attorney Deuprey tried to bring out the
particularly vulgar quality of a liar men
tioned, but witness remarked that such
terms were usual aoout the tent and were
Ã¼Ãed as "joshes."
The first witness called this morning
was Constable Glaze, who merely identi
fied the knife with which the stabbing
was done. He was followed by Sergeant
J. B. Dlckson, who had arrested Meadors
immediately after the affray. He had
witnessed the stabbing and described this
very minutely to the jury.
Corporal Silas was the next witness. He
had interfered between Ury and Meadors,
but when the iatter opened his knife he
had stepped back and watched the alter
cation. He had seen Ury facing the pris
oner and holding his gun in both hands,
the arms raised to his shoulders and with
the stock toward Meadors.
The other witnesses examined to-day
were Charles .^unhold and Walter Mur
phy. The testimony of none of the wit
nesses bears out the story told by Mea
dors at the County Jail about three hours
after the affray, which briefly was as fol
lows:
"Ury called me names, and picking up
a gun, held it to his waist with the
barrel pointed toward me. 'Put down that
knife ' ne said. T told him that when he
put down the gun I would put up my
knife.
"All the time I was watching his every
move. I saw his eyes off me for a mo
ment and then I made a lunge for the
gun, knocking It out of his grasp. He
then made at me with a vicious swing,
rushing out of the tent to report to the.
officer. I caught him by the right shoul
der and made a strike witn my knife for
his breast. His swing caused me to cut
him in the neck."
The courtroom to-day was crowded,
and at least twenty soldiers, including
Captain W. S. Barnes, were spectators.

to the owners of the winning yachts last
j evening in the assembly hall of the Mills
i building. The following yachts took first
| and second places at the regatta In their
respective classes:
Twenty-foot special classâ O. East
wood's yawl Kittiwake, first; J. E. Mc-
Culloch's sloop Petrel second.
Yawl classâ H. S. Pratfs Idler first, T.
L. Miller's Spray second.
Twenty-five foot classâ P. W. Hurndall'B
sloop Merope first, R. R. l'Hommedleu
and S. C. Delamater's sloop Phoenicia
second.
Thirty foot classâ Carl Westerfeld and
R. H. Morrow's sloop Aeolus first, J. W.
Pew's sloop Truant second.
Thirty-six foot classâ E. F. Sager and
C. M. Culver's sloop Edna first, E. N.
Walter and McLaughland Brothers' sioop
Embla second.
Forty-four foot classâ E. Donohoe's
sloop Speedwell first, A. J. Young and T.
W. Ransome's sloop Clara second.
To the yacht that took first place in
each class was awarded an association
j pennantâ a blue flag with the figures '9s
in white in the center, surrounded by six
! white stars, there being six clubs in the
associationâ and a certificate signed by
the president and secretary of the associ
ation. To the yachts that took second
place in their class were awarded cer
tificates of merit and ale mugs engraved
with a suitable inscription.
The following, however, were the princi
pal trophies awarded: The Macdon
ough cup, the Law cup and the Dele
gates' cup. The Macdonough cup, pre
i sented by J. M. Macdonough, la a very
; handsome solid silver cup, standing nearly
' seventeen inches high, and handsomely
decorated with rope, blocks, an anchor, a
'â  wheel and the flag of the association. It
was won by the sloop Aeolus in the thir-
I ty foot class, which took the Macdon-
I ough cup last year also. She defeated
i the sloop Truant by forty-two seconds
1 aotual sailing time, and by exactly two
I minutes corrected time.
[ The Law cup, presented by H. E. i.aw,
commodore of the Pacific Yacht Club dur
ing- 1897. is a graceful cup, and was won
by the yawl Klttiwake, after a close con
test with the sloop Petrel, ,ln the twenty
foot special class.
The Delegates' cup, presented by the
delegates from the six yacht clubs to the
association, is a handsome trophy, and
was won by the sloop Speedwell in vie
forty-four foot class.
The*se three cups, being all of solid sil
ver, and it being the first time that the
association has had three prizes of such
value to award, it was determined to
make the presentation as public as possi
ble.
NO DANGER OF BLOODSHED.
Letona, Ezeta's Old Enemy, Now in
the City. *
General L. Letona of the Central Amer
ican Republic arrived here Wednesday af
ternoon on the Fteamship City of Pan
ama and put up at the Occidental.
Residing in the city for some time past
is General Carlos Ezeta. erstwhile dlctaÂ«
tor of Salvador, and thereby hangs a
tale. It seems that when the Ezeta
brothers ruled Salvador with an iron
hand Letona in some way incurred the
displeasure of Carlos and narrowly es
caped being put to death. Stripped of
rank and fortune, he escaped across the
border and there awaited one of those
turns of the tide which come so fre
quently in the affairs of the Central
American republics. Returning from ex
ile when the Ezetas were driven from
Salvador, he was warmly welcomed by
the new President, who restored him to
rank and fortune. /
Since that time he has had no very
kindly feelings toward his old enemyâln
deed, the impression has prevailed here
that a meeting between the two generals
might result in bloodshed.

A DISGUSTED NEGRO.
Complains to the Supervisors Against
Chief Lees.
G. C. Davis, lightning negro mathema
tician, of 246 Third street, has demanded
his rights as an American eitfsen from
the Board of Supervisors. He claims, in
a communication addressed to the board
yesterday, that Chief of Police Lees has
prevented him from carrying on his busi
ness as a mathematical blackboard de
monstrator upon the streets of San
Francisco, having driven him forcibly un
der coyer, while at the same time "per
mitting white fakers of all sorts and
conditions to ply their nefarious voca
tions upon the public highway." Davis
says that the Chief is manifestly unfair
to colored people, and he thinks that it
is about time that the Supervisors called
him down. Â«
Divorce Suits Filed.
Linda Costello has applied for a divorce
from Charles Costello. alleging- desertion
as a cause of complaint. Suits for divorce

filed by Julia Donnel against James W.

WOULD SAVE
THOUSANDS
TO THE PARK
Use for the Gity Street
Sweepings.
SUPERVISORS URGED TO ACT
A NEW PROVISION NEEDED IN
THE CONTRACT.
Large Sums Spent for Loam That
Could Be Saved Without Extra
Expense to the Munici
cipality.
Before the present Board of Supervisors
goes out of office it will have the letting
o: the contract for sweeping the streets
for two years. The contract under which
the work is being done expires December
1, and It is likely that the new contract
will .be awarded before that date. This
contract Is one of the juiciest plums in
the gift of the Supervisors, the cost to
the city averaging, under the present
contract, $11,500 per month.
There is no complaint at the cost; it 13
doubtful if the work could be done for
any less, but if the Supervisors see fit
they can save the taxpayers something
like $115,000 a year in awarding tht new
contract, besides earning the gratitude of
every person who visits the city's big
pleasure ground.
For years the Park Commissioners have
endeavored to secure the street sweep-
Ings for Golden Gate Park. The reclaimed
portion uf the park Is in constant need
of new soil. It is all "made" ground,
the original surface being fine white sand
such as is seen in the western part that
is not under cultivation. The "made"
soil is no) deep; at most two or threo
feet, and the trees and flowers and
shrubs and grass plats demand fresh fer
tilizing material all the time. Every year
the commissioners devote every cent of
their appropriation not actually demanded
for otner purposes to the purchase o?
learn, and they seldom are able to buy
more than enough to replenish the part
already under cultivation. Consequently,
the reclamation of the sand dunes nearer
the ocean progresses exceedingly slow.
This loam costs 75 cents a yard and with.n
the past three months, the Commissioners
have expended $15,')0u for that purpose
aione, ail of which has been devoid <!%*
tirely to replenishing the soil east of
Strawberry Hill. This was absolutely
sary, as many of the trees and
shrubs began to shew signs of decay tor
want oi proper nourishment, and it was
essential to have the loam spread in time
bo the winter rains would mingle it with
the wornout soil underneath.
What the Park Commissioners want and
â¢what Superintendent McLaren has sought
to obtain for years, is the refuse that is
gathered daily from the streets and which
the city pays to have removed. This mat
ter has frequently been brought to the
attention of the Supervisors in the past
leveral years ago a hard fight was
made In the board to have the sweepings
carted to the park, but so far nothing has
been done. The preceding board, of which
A. B. Spreckels, now one of the Park
Commi.-siuiiers, was a member, inserted
a clause in the specifications governing
the present contract, providing that the
contractor must deliver the sweepings to
any point designated by the Commission
ers for use in Golden Gate Park, when
ever a request should be made through
the proper city authorities for such
sweepings, the Commissioners to pay the
extra cost of transportation, provided
there is any difference in the cost between
the dumps and Golden Gate Park. The
specifications further provide that the
contractor shall be liable to the city in
the sum of $1 for every load of sweepings
diverted from the park when there re
quired.
These provisions have never been en
i, although there has been urgent
need or the sweepings all the time. Com
missioner Spreckels and Superintendent
McLaren both say that the street sweep
ings would make fertilizing material far
superior to the loam they are now com
pelled to purchase, for while the sweep
ings are almost pure manure the loam is
a mixture of manure with clay and sand,
â which is allowed to decompose. These
gentlemen estimate that there is enough
of the sweepings to cover all the culti
vated parts of the park as frequently as
they require it, besides leaving a large
quantity for the reclamation of the west
ern sand dunes each year. The extra cost
of hauling to the park would be an in
significant item they would gladly pay,
and they would still have practically all
of the $25,000 they now spend annually for
loam to use in other Improvements.
Mr. Spreckels said yesterday that tue
Commissioners would reafllly find a place
in some convenient locality in the park
where all the sweepings could be dumped,
and the park employes would distribute
it wherever needed under the direction of
Superintendent McLaren. It would not be
necessary for the contractor to haul it
to all parts of the park, but only to the
one dump provided.
There is one point the Supervisors must
consider, and that is that the proposed
garbage ordinance provides that all
street sweepings shall be cremated, if
they will eliminate that clause and make
it mandatory upon the successful bidder
for the new contract to deliver the sweep
ings at the park, that magnificent resort
â will soon show the "beneficial results of
such action. It is a matter that every
man woman and child la interested In,
and all should work for its success.
BOARD OF TRADE ANGRY.
Resent the Harbor Commissioners'
Decision to Raise Their Rent.
The directors of tho State Board of
Trade are anything but pleased with the
action of the Harbor Commissioners in
Increasing the rental of the apartments to
be occupied by the exhibit of the Board
of Trade. This exhibit is the finest In
the West and it has won the admiration
of thousands, not only here but at Atlan
ta, Chicago and Hamburg. In the latter
place it carried off the world's prize in
competition with products from all parts
of trie globe. Just before-the mining fair
the Harbor Commissioners and the mana
ger of the board held a consultation and
it was decided that after the fair the ex
hibits would be kept at the Mechanics'
Pavilion until suitable rooms could be pro
vided in the new ferry building. At that
time the Harbor Commissioners were
willing to accept $50 per month rental, but
the Board of Trade wanted to be under
no obligations arÂ»d offered $100.
At the same time it was decided to allow
the State Mining Bureau to have the
rooms corresponding to those to be occu
pied by tho other organization at a rental
of Jl5O per month. The exhibits of both
would have been in place long ago but
for the delays of tho contractors, and at
last it seems that they will be able to
move in within a week. Every arrange
ment has been made for the removal, but
at yesterday's meeting the Harbor Com
missioners sprung a surprise upon their
prospective tenants. Commissioner R.
Harrold was the cause of the rental to
the State Board of Trade being raised to
$12." and that of the State Mining Bureau
to $150.
Manager J. A. Filcher of the Board of
Trade protested against what he called
snap judgment, and culled the attention
of the older members* of the commission
to the original understanding. After con
siderable discussion it was decided to let
the Mining Bureau have Its rooms at $135
and the State Board of Trade at $115 per
month. The alleged cause for the advance
in the rent was the cost of fixing up the
building and apartments for the prospec
tive occupants, but. there are not a few
who are of the opinion that had there not
been so much jobbery in the construction
of the new ferry building there would not
have been a raise of rent on two organi
zations that are maintained by the State
and public for the general good of Cali
fornia.
MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE
As Viewed by Different Sects
In Next Sunday's Call.
THE MYSTERY
OF A DEATH
for assistance in the horror of her loneliness, moaning In
X the agony of her death struggle, with her life blood gushing from nos-
O trils and mouth, Mrs. R. Barry spent the hours from midnight of Tues
day to 7:30 Wednesday morning and then the spark expired and left
but the senseless clay lying on the bed in the meagerlv furnished room at
S Anthony street. "While the autopsy of Dr. Gallagher, at the Morgue,
showed that death came from natural causes theje is still a mystery attach
ing to the case,
and upon a
thread of possi
bility the police
are working to
see if there was
something be
yond a hemor
rhage of the
lungs that
might be re
sponsible for
the death.
Occupying the
room above
where the wo
man lived Is
Mrs. E. P. Hen
nlng. From her
comes the story
which gives the
tinge of mys
tery to the
death of her
n&lghbor. whose
cries and moans
went unheeded
all through the
long hours.
Mrs. Hennlng
tells that when
she returned
from the the
ater about midnight Tuesday she heard Mrs. Barry scream and then moan.
These screams and moans were heard at Intervals until 7 o'clock, and then
the cries ceased and the moans continued for half an hour longer.
Notwithstanding the fact that evidences of suffering had been heard no
one went near the dead woman's room until yesterday morning, between
9 and 10 o'clock, when C. A. Onstoddt, proprietor of the place, sent a woman
Into the room to find why Mrs. Barry remained secluded. But, according
to Mrs. Henning, there was another suspicious incident connected with the
matter, and still she kept silent. There was a young man, claiming to be
the nephew of the dead woman, who roomed with her. This individual.
or possibly some one else, was heard by Mrs. Henning in the room with
the woman while she was screaming and moaning, and was seen again twen
ty-four hours later stealthily slipping into the room where the dead body
lay. remaining but a few minutes ard then as stealthily stealing away in
the darkness of the night.
It is on this statement that the police are basing a possible mystery, and
are investigating the antecedents of the woman.
When the alarm was given on the discovery of the death, the room was
found to be in order as if the woman had gone quietly to bed. When the
Morgue officials reached the house they state that they found the apartment
in great disorder, as if it had been ransacked. The woman's watch was
gone, as well as everything else she might have had of value except a
pair of cheap diamond earrings in her ears.
Investigation disclosed the fact that the woman was the wife of a sheep
herder in Paradise Valley, New A letter from the husband found In the
room stated that he had been deserted for another man, and the woman
had evidently repented and begged for forgiveness, but was told that "as
she had made her bed she must lie in it."
Mrs. Barry came to this city from Sacramento, where she had been liv
ing at 1431 Ninth street with Mrs. Alexander Donovan. She, with a young
man of about IS, came to San Francisco a week ago and rented two rooms
at 8 Anthony street, where they lived quietly, attracting no attention from
the other lodgers. The following description of the young man was given
the police by Mrs. Henning: About five feet five inches tall, smooth shav
en, stubby hair on the upper lip, dark eyes, sallow complexion, looked like
a "fiend," would not look one squarely in the eyes, had on an old and
worn dark suit and dark hat, and was evidently about IS years old.
Last night Detectives Gibson and Egan examined the trousers found In
the room where the woman died. Scrawled in ink on the lining of the false
pocket was the name "C. H. Hulmes." Whether Hulmes is the "nephew"
of the deceased or not the detectives are at a loss to say.
To-day, however, they intend to make a search for the man whose name
appears on the lining of the pocket.
SENATOR READY
FOR TROOPS
IN THREE DAYS
Valencia May Also
Sail Next Week.
MAKE ANOTHER EXPERIMENT
AMERICAN TROOPS' BAD BEHA
VIOR AT HONOLULU. '
A Board of Officers Appointed by
General Merriam to Examine
Into Efficiency of Two
Kansas Captains.
The transport Senator will be ready for |
the reception of troops on Monday, and j
it Is thought that the Valencia will also j
be prepared about the same time. Depot j
quartermaster. Major Long, had expected
to have the Senator in shape by to-mor
row, but the necessity of painting her
decks caused the delay. Work upon the
Ohio is rapidly being pushed along, while
Major Long stated yesterday morning
that he thought the Newport would
be ready to return to Manila inside of
ten days. The board appointed to ex
amine her will begin their Inspec
tion this morning. The troops that
have been designated to sail on the Sen
ator are ready to go aboard at any time,
and all that they are waiting for Is the
notification that the vessel Is ready, and
this they will probably receive Sunday.
The troops for the Valencia have not
been formally designated by General
Merriam, but it understood that this
transport, with the Ohio, is to carry the
First Washington Regiment and the re
mainder of the batteries of the Califor
nia Heavy Artillery.
There Is a strong probability that the
Government will make another exper
iment with the Tacoma, and send more
horses to Manila. General Merriam is
opposed to another attempt, but it is
probable that it will be made. Lieuten
ant Cameron of the Fourth Cavalry, who

Ci Late Wednesday night Lieutenant Cam
eron was relieved of all responsibility for
Government property on the Tacoma by
Lieutenant O'Shea of Fourth Cav
alry The latter officer will probably be
In charge of the Tacoma if she is again
sent to Manila. He .is the only officer
available, and his troop being In Manila
he will very likely be sent so . that he
may join it. Lieutenant Cameron leaves
the first of the week for West Point,
where he has been ordered to become an
! instructor in drawing at the military
academy.
Apropos of the recent trouble" in Hon
olulu, In which General Merriam's son Is
reported to have figured prominently,
an officer who has Just - returned from
Honolulu states that there is much fric
tion between the people of Honolulu and
the troops now encamped there as a re
sult of the depredations of the soldiers
and their generally bad conduct. It is
reported that General Merriam has re
ceived a letter from his - son in which
he disclaims- haying ; taken any part in
the disgraceful scene enacted there.
An order was Issued from department
headquarters late yesterday afternoon by
General Merriam appointing :.- Colonel
Wholley, First Washington; Major Rice,
California Heavy Artillery; Major Met
calf, Twentieth Kansas; ; Major Bayless,
First Tennessee, . and Major ; Carr, First
Washington, a board to convene at the
Presidio to-day for the purpose of.exam

lning into the capacity, qualifications,
conduct and efficiency of Captains J. E.
Towers and G. N. Watson of the Kansas
Regiment. It appears that the efficiency
of these officers has been questioned, and
under the provisions of Congress, with
the approval of the colonel commanding,
such a board may be appointed by the
department commander.
Acting under instructions from Wash
ington, transmitted through the depart
ment commander. General Miller yester
day Issued an order to the regimental
commanders to furnish a complete field
return of their commands, also the num
ber of guns, the caliber of the ammuni
tion and descriptive lists of each man.
The last part of the order is of vital im
portance, as many of the men who have
been left here or sent back on account of
sickness have been unable to get any
pay or to even be discharged because they
have not their descriptive list.
Dr. A. H. Giannini of this city has re
ceived his commission as assistant sur
geon In the regular army and will be
stationed at the Division Hospital at the
Presidio.
The Utah Light Battery will probably
be sent to do garrison duty at Angel Is
land.
THE ALHAMBRA ATTACHED.
A Move to Prevent Alleged Unjust
Claims.
An attachment suit for $11,577 50 against
the Alhambra Theater was filed in the
Sheriff's office yesterday by Abraham
Reuf, through George B. Keene, an at
torney in Mr. Reuf's office. It is stated
that the attachment is a friendly one in
its nature, being intended to protect the
theater from certain unjust claims. Reuf
is understood to be the principal financial
backer of the Alhambra. It is stated
that another theater in the city has been
making most of the trouble by enticing
away actors by promises of more money,
thereby putting the Alhambra to great
expense to fill their places. It Is alleged
that the disputed claims, which Reuf
characterizes as unjust, are the out
growth of this theater warfare. The Al
hambra will continue to do business aa
before.

THE SEVENTH
MAKES ITS
FINAL EXIT
Broke Camp Yester
day.
ACCORDED MANY HONORS
ITS GOING HOME WAS AN IM
PRESSIVE CEREMONY.
Colonel Berry and His Officers For
mally Paid Their Last Re
spects to Brigadier Gen
eral Miller.
Under circumstances that were quietly !
impressive the Seventh Regiment. Cali- j
fornia Volunteers, marched from the Pre- !
sidlo yesterday morning and began its ;
homeward journey to Los Angeles. The
departing soldiers were accorded the pre
scribed military honors by General Mar
cus P. Miller and the organizations form- j
ing the First Brigade. A large concourse j
of people crowded the line of march to j
witness the departure of the Seventh. ;
The men were in a happy frame of mind.
Their countenances were bathed in smiles j
and perspiration, and during their march j
to the ferry they frequently drowned the ;
rhythmic tramp of their feet in a j
mighty burst of cheers that bespoke more j
forcibly than words the happiness that
was theirs.
There was a large crowd at the Pre
sidio to see the regiment off, and this j
was greatly augmented by the addition I
of the soldiers of the Second Brigade.
la accordance with the order issued by j
General Miller the First Brigade whs
formed on Lombard avenue. Shortly j
after 8 o'clock the regiment marched on i
to Its parade, and Captain Alfonso quick- â 
ly went through the work of putting it
Into its last regimental formation. Then â 
he turned it over to Colonel Berry, who ;
gave the necessary orders and the regl- |
mental line of masses broke into a col- |
umn of companies and the Seventh
marched gladly through its camp out {
on to the main road of the Presidio, i
where its band very appropriately struck |
up "Home. Sweet Home." The First
Brigade presented arms as the regiment
passed, and the colors of each command
were lowered in honor to those of the
Seventh, which in turn were lowered in
acknowledgment. In passing General
Miller, whose position was midway of his
brigade, the band played "Avid Lang
Syne," the departing officers saluted their ;
former commander and in turn were ea- |
luted, the colors were quietly uncovered
and amid the silence of all present the
Seventh made its- exit from the Preflidlo.
There were to be heard upon all sides
expressions of sympathy for Colonel Ber
ry and the regiment generally. The sim
plicity of the ceremonies attending the
Seventh's^ going away were impressive
because of their nature. Colonel Berry
marched at the head of his command,
but despite his military bearing and the
doggedly set look upon his countenance
there was something that clearly showed
his keen disappointment and the deter
mination to abide his time and vindica
tion. .
Before leaving Colonel Berry and his
officers formally call led upon General Mil
ler at his headquarters, and Colonel Ber
ry, upon the part of the regiment, his
officers and for himself, thanked the
general for his many kindnesses, and ex
pressed his appreciation of them. He
spoke of the friendly relations that have
always existed between the regiment and
General Miller, and stated that its men
and officers would always hold him In
kind and affectionate regard.
The following communications were re
ceived by the Red Cross and Catholic
Truth Societies yesterday from the medi
cal department of the Seventh California
Volunteer Regiment, which was mustered
â¢out a few days ago, and are aelf-explana
tory:
To the Red Cross Society: We, the under
signed officers of the medical department, in
behalf of ourselves and of every man In the
Seventh California Infantry. United States
Volunteers, desire to publicly acknowledge the
great debt of gratitude tliut we owe the ladies
of the Hed Cross Society for their faithful,
helpful and noble work in behalf of our sick
men.
It is Impossible to estimate the value of
their work in our behalf. From the very first
days of our military service we have found
them ready to assist us by money, supplies and
especially by faithful personal labor. They
have been ever willing to respond to the call
of distress and suffering. The number of men
who have been saved from death or life-long
suffering through the work of this society can
never be known. We desire to especially thank
Mesdames Harrington, Merrill, Eaaton, Corn
wall, Martin, Powers and Van Slyke of River
side and many others who have regularly vis
ited our camp in the Interest of the society.
We extend our thanks to every Individual
citizen of San Francisco who received us with
such generous hospitality, treated us with such
courtesy and manifested such high apprecia
tion of our efforts to support the Government
by their willingness to aid and assist us on any
and every occasion, and by opening their homes
and hospitals to our slok. Our heart? overflow
with love for you all and we will ever think
of you aa being the most liberal and patriotic
people on earth. We await an opportunity to
reciprocate all your kindness.
We are also extremely grateful to the va
rious hospitals for the generous way In which
they have treated us. Especially do we thank
the French Hospital, which cared for so many
of our sick men gratuitously. Dr. Putnam, the
genial resident physician of the hospital, never
tired of the vexatious burdens that w-re placed
upon him. and both he and his capable nurses
have endeared themselves tv us for all time.
We can thank I>r. l'utnam for his care and
services, but God alone can reward the faith
ful Klrls who watched over our sick with such
tender care.
In conclusion, we thank every hospital and
every nurse who has cared for one of our sick
men! and we feel sure that a br'ght crown
awaits them.

NEW HEIRS LAY
CLAIM TO JACOB Z.
DAVIS' BIG ESTATE
Children of His Dead Brother
Will Fight to Have the Case
Reopened.
The Best of Legal Talent in Atlanta, Ga.,
and This City Securedâ A Spirited
Contest Promised.
It Is almost assured that the big estate
of the late millionaire Jacob Z. Davis
will be thrown into the courts again, for
ail that Probate Judge Coffey has or
dered its distribuUun and final settlement
Two new heirs have made their appear
ance, and thoir interests have been pi
In the hands of one of the best law firms
of Atlanta, Ga. The machinery of the
law has been set in motion in this city,
and there is every promise that the com
ing contest for the dead man's money wi.l
be Becond to the Blythe case, thac
dragged through the courts for so many
years, to the satisfaction and enrichment
of the lawyers. Several days agu a letter
was received In this city by a man well
known to every one in the State from a
firm of lawyers of Atlanta. Ga. For per
sonal reasons, an acquaintance with the
Ban Francisco heirs, the name of the
gentleman receiving the letter in omitted,
and for reasons politic the name ut tne
Georgia law linn is not given; but the
letter reads thus:
"We have a very important matter that we
desire you to look into at once, which Is as
follows: Mr. Jacob H. Davis died some two
years ago in San Francisco and left un estate
of about two millions <$2.0G0.u00), which we see
liv a newspaper account has been lately dis
tributed between his heirs, two nieces. Mrs.
John M Curtis and Miss Lizzie Muir, and that
Judge Coffey presided in the distribution of th >
t-stute. Mr. Jacob H. Davis had a brother in
cur â to. who resided In Newnan. Ga. The
two Davis brothers came originally irom Penn
sylvania. Davis, who resided at Newnan, is
now dead, and has left a wife and two minor
children, one. William Harry Davis, aged IC,
and the othÂ«-r. Willie Frank Davis, his daugh
ter, aged IS years now, who has married \\ . H.
RaKsdale. .
Mr W. B. Berry, now of Newnan. da., and a
banker there, an'! the father of Judge John
D Berry of this State, was in San Francisco
several years ago and met Mr. Jacob H. Davis
there and recognized him as the brother of Mr.
I>avls of Newnan. his neighbor.
The two brothers corresponded for years
afterward, and there is no question but hat
his children are the heirs of Jacob H. Davis.
â W9 see that the estate has been distribute by
Judge Coffey. Now, It will require some lawyer
of ability to look into this matter and take
charge of it and get a division for these child
ren and have a stop put to the proceedings If
possible, or If the heirs already have the prop- -
erty to commence a redistribution for the heirs ,
here.
From the newspaper reports there appears to |
have been no will left by Davis, or If there hail I
been It appears to have been set aside, because
the account states that the estate was dis- I
WORK OF TEMPLARS
NEARING A CLOSE
OFFICERS ARE APPOINTED FOR
THE ENSUING YEAR.
Fresno Decided Upon for the Next ,
Annual Convention â Delegates
Banquet and Make Merry.
The thirty-ninth annual sersion pt the
Independent Order of Good Templars is ,
nearing a close. The fin.al work, em- j
bracing: principally the election of various ,
officers for the ensuing year, is almost
complete. Many of these officers have
already been appointed, and the rest will ,
be elects at the session which i.s to be {
called at 10 o'clock this morning. Those j
already appointed are: Grand chief I
templar. Theodore D. Kanouse; grand
councilor, William Crowburst: grand vice i
templar. Mrs. A. Bchadt; grand secre- j
tary, F. A. Anthony; grand treasurer, i
Volney Taylor; grand superintendent |
Junior Templars, F. A. Anthony.
It was unanimously decided to hold the
annual convention of 1899 at Fresno on
October 1 of the coming year.
In the early part of tho evening imme
diately before the night session a banquet
â¢was tendered the delegates to the con
vention. Many toasts to the success and
perpetuation i>f the noble principles upon
â which the organization is founded were
proposed and responded to by the assem
bled delegates. Among the principal
toast makers were: J. M. Walling of Ne
vada City, Robert Thompson, Theodore
X>. Kanouse. W. P. Hetherton and Bar
clay J. Smith.
The afternoon session was devoted
mainly to routine work. J. M. Walling
introduced a motion to hold a public
meeting for the Orphans' Home, but
after considerable discussion it was con
sidered advisable to vote the motion out
of favor.
The various yearly reports, including
those of the grand treasurer, the secre
tary and the committee on literature were
read and iiled. It was decided by a gen
era! vote to make the "Reserve" the offi
cial organ of publication during the ensu
ing year. It was also recommended to

tributed among the heirs of Jacob H. Davia,
leaving the Intimation that then? was an in
testacy. If Davis ulcd intestate the minors
liere ure even more nearly related to him than
the two nieces in San Francisco, becaune the
San Francisco nieces are only children of his
half sister, while the minors here are children
of his full brother.
We tire not aware what your California stat
ute le upon the subject of reopening an estate
after the same hail been distributed, but we
presume that there is no doubt but that this
can bo done upon the discovery of new heirs
who were not parties to the distribution and
had no knowledge of It, and especially where
these heirs are minors, who could not lose
any of their rights, anJ against whom the
statute of limitation cuuld not run.
\\>: would be very much obliged If you would
rofer us to some capable, aggressive lawyer,
who would take charge of the matter and push
it to a speedy conclusion.
It may be that the distribution has
reached a staere where immediate action is
necessary to defend any further ateps being
taken. If this Is true, we will b<* very much
obliged if you will refer such a lawyer to us
and have him see Judge Coffey or taks other
pn i>-r Bteps to have the matter delayed until
wo can forward the proper papers In order
to have the heirs represented. If the matter
has reached a stage rendering it necessary you
may telegraph us at our expense. â¢ â¢ â¢
As may be noticed, the initial "H" in the
name is wrong, but that is believed to be
a mistake of the clerk writing the letter.
The San Francisco gentleman to whom
the letter was addressed at once notified
the Atlanta attorneys of the condition the
case is In and also sent them the names
of several of the best-known lawyers of
this city, such as George A. Knight. W.
W. Foote, Eugene Deuprey and T. B.
Bishop. Already the wires have begun to
work in the interests of the Atlanta heirs
of the dead millionaire, but the San Fran
cisco attorney is keeping in the dark until
some plan of action has been decided
upon. What the first move will be re
mains to be seen. It is said that a step
will be made to have Judge Coffey reopen
the case, but that if he refuses to
do so the case can be taken into the
Federal courts, on the ground that the
contesting heirs, not yet represented, are
residents of another State. This course
was pursued in the Blythe case and in
the noted Sharon case, in both of which
the foreign residence of some of the in
terested parties cut a considerable figure.
Judging from portions of the letter omit
ted from the foregoing, the people in
terested in the heirs in Atlanta have some
money to spend, and from the standing of
the attorneys employed, there and here,
the purpose Is to contest the case to the
bitter end.
Attorney General A. I* Hart. Assistant
District Attorney Dunne appeared for the
prosecution.
By consent the cases were continued
for a week, at which time it ia expected
that both sides will be ready to proceed.

HOUNDS OF GREAT SPEED.
High Class Dogs Will Course at
Ingleside Park on Saturday.
I,e,'Lshmen can readily recognize how
popular the sport of coursing must be at
Ingleside Coursing Park when at the
drawing held laat evening at Pythian j
Hall 125 nominations were submitted to j
the committee, but owing to the amount
of time allotted to run off this stupendous j
stake it was thought advisable to accept j
only eighty-eight entries, which is, all |
things considered, the largest stake ever
introduced in an inclosed park.
The dogs that figure in the "drawing"
are the best in the State, and it goes
without saying that on Saturday and
Sunday next leashmen will witness cours
ing rounds of such great interest that pat
rons of the game will gather from all
parts of the country to witness the sport.

or more. The dead man was formerly a
hostler in the establishment of Hobbs &
Wall and was dicharged on the sth of the
present month. Since that tlmo he had
been on a spree, and it is believed that
while wandering around in the dark he
fell Into the water through one of the
numerous large holes that disfigure many
of the city wnarves. Murdoch was a sin

MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE
As Viewed by Different Sects
in Next Sunday's Call.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 14, 1898.
WEDDING IN YELLOW AND WHITE
tN honor of the wedding of two of
I its most popular members, Miss
X Maude Hodson and George Nor
ris Nash, Simpson Memorial
Church was decked in Its prettiest
last evening. From the rail of the or
gan loft to the reading desk, the
green of brake and fern softened the
glare of the chandeliers, and big
bunches of chrysanthemums waved
their plumes of white and yellow
on either side of the steps where
the bridal party stood.
It was a white and yellow wed
ding, and the chosen shades were
seen in the bower of green at the
platform, in the decorations on the
walls, in the ribbons that bound
the streamers of smllax across the
aisles and in the gowns of the
bridesmaids and the maid of honor
and the flowers they bore with them
in the bridal procession.
The church was crowded as the
wedding march announced the ap
proach of the bride. She was es-
corted by her father, and preced
ing her were the maid of honor, her
four bridesmaids and the ushers.
Rev. John Stephens, pastor of the
church, awaited them, and as the
bridegroom came forward to meet
the bride the notes of the organ
grew fainter and changed to simple,
solemn harmonies of a hymn, while
NINE JURORS TO TRY
PREACHER NEAD'S CASE
THE COMPLAINT WAS LOST AND
ANOTHER SUBSTITUTED.
More Talesmen Will Be Examined
To-Day and Then the Trial
â¢ Will Proceed.
y
The case of vagrancy against John M.
Nead was called before Judge Conlan yes
terday, and proceeded as far as the ac
ceptance of nine jurors.
It was with some little difficulty that
the case started at all, for when all was
' ready It was found that the complaint
i was missing, and so the prosecution asked
I leave to file another in place of the orig
inal. The defense objected,: as it was in
duty bound to do; but the acting clerk
was put upon the stand, and after he had
declared he had looked diligently through
all the drawers of his desk and in every
place a complaint for vagrancy was likely
to be found, but without success, the
i court allowed the duplicate document to
1 be placed on record.
The panel of Jurors was called, but not
' before the defense had registered another
i objection, this time to the talesmen. It
I was declared by Mr. Gallagher that the
talesmen had been summoned by Chief
Lees and Policeman Welsh, both of whom
he said were prejudiced against his client
to* such a degree that no juror summoned
by them or either of them was capable
lof fairly trying Nead. This objection, like
I its predecessor, was without avail, and
! then the jury box was filled.
Policeman Welsh had summoned the
A BASEBALL INNOVATION.
An Indoor Game Played at the Olympic
Club Which Puzzled Beholders. .
T OCAL. baseball managers are over
looking a bet.
I i There is a member of the Olympic
Club that can decide a close play
with his eyes shut and knows all about
strikes, fouls and balls with his back
turned. Bennett need no longer hide his
light under a bushel. His vocation is
found.
Possibly he wouldn't live long on the
regular field, but he would make it inter
esting while he lasted.
There was a game of baseball In the
big gymnasium of the club last night and
Bennett umpired it. That is all that is
necessary to say about Bennett, unless it
might be that his umpiring was appro
priate to the game.
The "Stone Nine" played the "Butz
Nine" and the score was 20 to 14. Which
side got the 20 and which the 14 not even
the scorer knows, but he knows that one
Bide got 20 and the other 14. One of the
beauties of that kind of scoring is that
both nines can claim the honors with
equal certainty of being right.
To the unsophisticated onlooker it was
the words of the ceremony were
being repeated.
Immediately after the service the
invited guests proceeded to the
home of the bride, 416 Geary street,
where a reception was held. The
young couple will spend their honey
moon in the south, and will then
take up their residence at 1326 Sac
ramento street.
The gTOom is a nephew of Captain
Charles Goodall, and is treasurer of
the Coos Bay Coal Company. His
bride is the daughter of J. R. Hod
son, the photographer. Both are
well known in social circles and in
the Slmoson Memorial congrega
tion, Mr. Nash being president of the
Young People's Society, and the for
mer Miss Hodson one of Its vice
presidents.
Miss Myrtle Hodson, sister of the
bride, was maid of honor at the
wedding, and Arthur Hubbard Cole
acted as best man. Miss Alice Es
telle Miles, Miss Jean Drake Beach.
Miss Mabel Lucinda "Williams and
Miss Carolyn George were brides
maids, and Roscoe Wiley Perkins,
John Julius Bolser, Harry L. Ma
son and Walter Lee Glenn were
ushers.
Jurors, and he had not made a good job
of it. Half the jurors did not know when
their names were called, as not one in
three was correctly spelled; but when the
box was filled several Jurors solemnly
rose and asked to be excused on the
ground of pressure of business. In the
greater number of these cases the excuse
was established and the talesmen were
let go to attend to business more import
ant than establishing the guilt or inno
cence of Nead the preacher. Nine jurors
were all the panel yielded, and then the
case was put over until 11 o'clock ti.is
morning, when fifteen more peers will
be haled to court to answer questions
and, perhaps to listen to evidence. The
jury box will be filled from them and
then the case will proceed at once.

Sudden Death of a Veteran.
An elderly man named Thomas Gainor
died suddenly yesteray morning: on the
sidewalk In front of 612 Sacramento street.
An inquest will be held by Coroner Haw

occupation, a native of Ireland and 62

Veterans' Home in Napa County.
difficult to tell whether it was a game
of baseball or football. Then again it
may have been an amateur circus. Krel
ing as clown and Hammersmith as ring
master.
For ground and lofty tumbling many of
the actorsâ players, rather â can consider
themselves eligible to a position in a
vaudeville show. There was Taylor for
Instance. He could fall over himself and
the ball more and do less toward putting
out the runner than would be thought
possible unless the act were seen.
It is generally expected that a report of
a baseball game will tell all about the
positions, plays, errors and all the other
pyrotechnics that usually go with well
regulated sports, but if last night's game
is to be taken as a criterion, future base
ball reporters will have to learn some
thing new. If anybody had a regular posi
tion and played it, it was an accident. So
far as errors are concerned there were
none. Of course, fumbles, muffs, wild
throws and all that sort of business can't
be counted in indoor baseball for that is
evidently what the game is for. If the
players can't roll all over themselves and
each other, what is ihe use of playing?
But it is worth going a long way to see
A SURPRISE
IS PLANNED
FOR POTTER
Miss Van Ness Leaves
for Honolulu.
TO SEE HIM ONCE AGAIN
TOUCHING FAREWELL SCENES
AT THE DOCK.
The Woman Who Attempted Suicide
on Account of Misprized Love
Seeks the Object of Her
Affections. .
When the Alameda, which left this port
last Thursday, arrives In Honolulu, Ash
ton Potter, corporal, clubman and breaker
of well-exercised hearts, will receive a
surprise. If he takes the bait that is of
fered him he will meet the incoming
steamer before it arrives and search the
decks for a fair unknown to whom he
has, by this time, received a letter of in
troduction. The fair one with an aureole
of crushed strawberry hair circling her
head is no other than Violet Van Ness,
the young woman who first thought -she
would cut off her life and then thought
she wouldn't because Potter was not as
devoted as he might have been.
Ever since the fateful night when Violet
Van Ness reached out her right hand and
scooped a Smith & Wesson from her bu
reau, by the use of which she thought
eternal happiness might be bought, her
life has been full of dreams of the young
soldier who went along with his regiment
and left her to pine in thought and in
the misery of solitude. She tried to for
get him and the mightiness of his bish
opric father who lives in New York, but
it was of no avail. With recurrent per
sistence the one great subject of her
thoughts forced itself upon her mind.
The man she loved was Ashton Potter,
and she must see him again at any cost.
So when the last steamer left for Hono
lulu Miss Van Ness had taken passage
and was aboard under an assumed name. ,
Just live rrinutes before the Alameda left
a hack rushed down to the vessel and a
pretty woman of terra cotta head adorn
ment jumped out to be embosomed by j
the embraces of a" number of her lady j
friends who were there to bid her good- |
by. It was a touching scene, and Miss ;
Van Ness gave way to a flood of tears j
and paroxysmic grief that was only
quelled by the much forcible eloquence
of her friends. Miss Van Ness cried
aloud that she would see him once again
and this time there would be an account
ing. She also said that she felt that she
would never return.
Her friends all knew of her intention to
go to Hon6lulu and the reason of it. To
them she confided some time before she
left that she would see Potter once again
under any circumstances. "Her love ior
him. she confessed, was just as strong
and deep-seated as ever, but, with an in
vocation to all the gods of every Tftyth
ology, she bade him beware and not i.o
trifle with her affection. In order to givu
Ashton Potter a surprise, she had a let
ter sent to him which told of her coming,
but It was not in the name that he knows
her by. It was an assumed and ficti
tious name, one which she declared
would make him come out into the har
bor to meet the ship. Trusting that her
little plan would not miscarry she would
then confront him. her future conduct to
be determined according to the reception
which he offered. Some say that she took
her revolver along with her. While they
do not think that Potter is in any dan
ger, they fear that Miss Van Ness may
end her life if she is rebuked.
The Alameda is due in Honolulu to
day.

â well, all of them steal bases when they
have but twenty feet to run to do it.
From an athletic standpoint the game
was a Bucceess. The players got plenty
of exercise for an hour and a half, and
everybody was so well pleased that pro
fessional baseball will undoubtedly have
an influx of nÂ£w players.
A gentleman who had a dislocated chest
acted as scorer and kept tally on the back
of an election card. At least he said he
kept it, but no one else could tell what it
meant. He announced the score at the
end of the ninth inning, but that made no
difference to the players â they kept right
on, just as if he hadn't spoken, and when
he announced that the score was 20 to
14 Taylor, Burgess, Morton, Hammer
smith, Jama, Lincoln, Clark, Kane and
Stone of the Stone nine were as vocifer
ous in their claim of victory as were
Derham, Follanabee, Hewson, Grimmel,
Butz, Jackson, Kreling, Monahan and
Hanrahan of the Butz nine. But as the
players themselves forgot to which nine
they belonged and coached indiscrim
inately, it probably makes no difference
which side achieved the victory.

THE TRAINING STATION
ON GOAT ISLAND
CAPTAIN F. W. DICKINS' MIS
SION TO THIS COAST.
He Has Come to Arrange for the
Erection of the Buildings
and Wharf.
Captain F. W. Dickins, assistant chief
of the Bureau of Navigation, Navy De
partment, has arrived from Washington,
D. C, and Is at the Occidental. The ob
ject of his visit to this coast is the estab
lishment of a naval training station on
"Goat Island."
"Last winter," he said yesterday, "Con
gress appropriated $50,000 toward the es
tablishment of a naval training station
for apprentices at Yerba Buena Island â
as it Is officially calledâ the whole cost
of barracks, quarters, wharf, water sup
ply, etc., not to exceed $100,000. We pro
pose to erect a building 300x60 feet, with
wings 100x60 feet, and I am here for the
purpose of selecting the best site for
these buildings and wharf, estimating the
cost of the water supply, etc.
"We hope to accommodate about 300
boys, to be drawn, practically, from this
coast. The Pensacola will be the train
ing ship.
The boys will be kept at the training
station for six months and then will be
sent on a cruising trip for about eignt
months. They will then b"e drafted into
the general service, where they will re
main until 21 years of age. Boys will be
enlisted between 14 and It years of age,
upon their agreement to serve until uÂ»ey
are 21. In this third class they receive $9
per month pay and an outfit costing not
to exceed $45. Upon reaching their ma
jority they get a certificate of graduation,
and if they re-enlist receive preference
for the rating of petty officers.
"Men so trained have proved the most
valuable on our modern vessels of war.
Some of the best of them are sent to the
Washington navy-yard for six months to
study modern ordnance, and from there
to the torpedo station at Newport. K. 1.,
for another six months, to learn all about
torpedoes, diving, etc. Those who com
plete these two courses are given certifi
cates as seamen gunners. These are the
valuable men behind the guns. _ J
"I have decided about the location of the
buildings and wharf to-day, and have the
water supply under consideration. Ihe
plans and specifications of the buildings
are now being made in Washington, and,
when ready. will be submitted to Pacific
Coast contractors. The only other train
ing station of the kind in the country is
at "We W shaJl' probably be ready to award
contracts for construction of buildings
and wharf within six weeks The station
will, I think, be opened next spring.
Fighting Shy of Manila.
Two applications for writs of habeas
corpus were made to the United States
District Court yesterday on behalf of
Horace W. Bigelow, aged 19 years, and
Chester A. Morris, aged 20 years. The
parents of the young men allege that the
boys enlisted In the First Regiment, Was
hington Volunteers, in the State of Wash
ington, last May without the consent of
their parents. Judge Hawley ordered
Lieutenant Colonel Fife to produce the
boys In court at 10 o'clock to-morrow
morning.
