?* tion laid by the important dis- 8

The Herald-Call correspondent has
no desire to magnify Ensign Powel
son's part in the international drama
now being played in the neighboring
harbors of two friendly powers. I have
never met Powelson personally and do
not know him by sight, but tb s fact re
mains that the court's chief purpose in
returning to Havana yesterday was to
clinch beyond peradventure of doubt
this very evidence, and record it so
conclusively that its accuracy can i
never be fairly questioned. No other I
â witness was summoned yesterday, i
though the court held its usual two
sessions and they were busy ones, too.
In all probability no other witness than
Powelson will be hoard to-morrow or
Tuesday, and )f any other testimony is
taken hereafter in Havana than that
of the ensign it will be or incidental
rather than of vital character.
The Herald and Call in their reports
of the inquiry task have indulged in no
flights of imagination nor have they
given credence to wild reports emanat
ing from irresponsible or prejudiced
sources. They were the first to ex
plain the nature of Powelson's discov
eries and were quick to realize their
vast Import. That the court itself
places a like \'alue upon this particular
evidence ia pretty well established by
the fact that it has already given Pow
elson more of its time than has been
devoted to any other five witnesses
combined, except, perhaps, to Captain
Rlgsbee.
I learned to-day that when the Court
of Inquiry left here nearly a week ago
for Key West it realized thoroughly
that in Powelson's report at last lay
the true key to the problem. It re
quested that a portio-n of the divers at
work on the wreck should be kept busy
exclusively in verifying or disproving
the deductions. Lieutenant Command
er Wainwright readily assented, and it
wai agreed that the reports of these
livers should be made to the court in
writing and presented by Powelson.
Wainwright, being Powelson's superior
In rank, has retained supervision of the
divers* movements, but one of the most
efficient corps of submarine experts has
acted for nearly a week practically un
der orders of the ensign, making their
written reports through him. Ensign
Powelson meanwhile has found time to

Maine, which were forced upward twen

The San Francisco Call

The written reports of divers cover

â  ful study of Powelson's drawings, I un
derstand, were the subject matter ex
; clusively at yesterday's session of the
i court. They will probably keep the
i court busy at least one more day, and
; possibly two. It is not certain that the
I court will close its case at that point,
; however. New witnesses, whose stories
appear important, at least to them
selves, are continually cropping up.
I Some of them come before this digni
fied body to repeat some wildly absurd

I the policy of the court to give even

conscientious hearing, provided they
seem to be sincere, for It is the purpose
of the court to hear and sift all the evi
j dence that seems to bear directly or in
directly upon its task. *
Without assuming to forecast what
this conservative court of naval experts
will actually report when the time
comes to formulate its conclusions I do
not think it presumptuous in the light

HAVANA, March 6.â The Court
of Inquiry held no formal ses
sion to-day aboard the Man
grove, but spent several hours
this morning over the drawings
and diagrams and in informal
consultation with Ensign Powel
son and Diver Andrew Olsen,
who remained aboard the light
house tender until noon. Havana
Harbor presented a brilliant hol
iday spectacle to-day, and hun
dreds of boatloads of visitors
from the shore visited the Span
ish cruisers, Vizcaya and Almi
rante Oquendo. The Spanish
officers held open house all day,
and . received courteously the
great troops of Spaniards and
Cubans, who strolled at will rrver
the decks and admired the spick
and span appearance of every
thing about the two fine
sister ships of Spain. At
4 o'clock the captain's gig
was ordered off from the Al
mirante Oquendo, and Captain
Juan Batista Lazaga y Cary
paid his official visit of courte
sy to Captain Cowles and Cap
tain Sigsbee on board the dis
patch boat Fern. The Oquendo's
captain remained about ten min
utes. During that time he ex
pressed warmly to Captain Sigs
bee his sympathy and sorrow at
the loss of the Maine. Only one
body was recovered to-day. It
was identified as that of Ser
geant Wagner of the Maine's
marine guard.

It was reported to-night that there
was a meeting of prominent Senators
at the home of Senator Hoar of Massa

; agreed that if the President desired to
buy foreign-built men-of-war they
would pledge their votes to sustain his
action. Members of the House Naval
| Committee are equally hearty in their
statements that they will vote the nec
essary appropriations should the Presi
! dent decide to purchase foreign built
ships.
I learned to-day that Secretary Long
has given telegraphic instructions to
place the cruisers Minneapolis and Col
i umbia in commission immediately. It
iis admitted by the authorities that
there are no men to form the crews for
these ships, but it i 3 proposed to enlist
! additional men and ask Congress to
''â  grant the necessary authority. It is
I probable that only half crews will be
j placed on board each ship for the pres
j ent. The remainder can be recruited
and placed on board without delay.
The department issued orders to sev

during this week for duty on board the
, crulsera. Both ships have been placed
:in condition for service. Their supplies,
i with the exception of coal, have been
j placed on board by their reserve crews,
and coal can be put in the bunkers
! within a week. It is the purpose to
j continue Captain J H. Sands in com
mand of the ' olumltia. Captain G. H.
Wadleigh, who reHr.rjuished command
of the Minneapolis last May when that
vessel entered into reser\e, may re
ceive orders to return to her. It is ex
pected the department will announce
the details of officers for these ships
probably to-morrow. As the Herald
s has stated, the Columbia and Minne
apolis, when placed in commission, will
be attached to the North Atlantic
; squadron, and when the time comes
will probably form, with the Brooklyn
and New T rk. a flying squadron to de

by the authorities that he has
repeated his advice upon his ar

sending relief supplies to suffer

very prompt to protest against a

one occasion, spoke unofficially
to officials of the State Depart

the impropriety of Consul-Gen

He complained of the latter's al

Havana. He did not ask for
Consul-General Lee's recall be

do so by his Government, but he
hinted that it would be much

send a Consul-General to Ha

REQUEST FOR
LEE'S RECALL
IS REFUSED
Blunt and Unequivocal An
swer to the Madrid
Government.
Neither Will This Nation Refrain
From Sending Cuban Relief
Supplies in War
Vessels.
Call Office, Rlggs House,
Washington, March 6.
The Spanish situation devel
oped two new phases to-day,
when it became known that the
Spanish Government had form
ally requested the recall of
Consul-General Lee from his
post at Havana with which re
quest the United States had
courteously but firmly refused
to comply; also that the Spanish
Government has suggested the
impropriety of sendingreliefsup
plies to the Cuban reconcentra
dos on the cruiser Montgomery
and the gunboat Nashville, to
which suggestion the United
States had given a non-concur
rent answer.
The first intimation of these steps 1
came in a brief and explicit cablegram ]
from Madrid. Prior to its receipt, how
ever, the authorities here had been
fully conversant with the facts, al
though no intimation has been allowed
to get to the public on either subject.
The disclosures from Madrid left no |
further ground for reticence in Wash
ington, and after a conference at the
White House between the President,
Assistant Secretary Day of the State
Department and Secretary Long of the
Navy Department the following au
thorized statement was handed to the
press by Judge Day as comprising
everything that was to be said by the
administration on the subject:
The President will not consider j

the recall of General Lee. He has
borne himself throughout this crisis
with judgment, fidelity and courage,
to the President's entire satisfaction.
As to the supplies for the relief of
the Cuban people all arrangements
have been made to carry a consign
ment from Key West by one of the
naval vessels â whichever may be
most adapted for the purpose â to Ma
tanzas and Sag-ua.
Beyond the foregoing those who had
participated in the conference at the
White House would not discuss the
subject, and it was stated positively
that the authorized statement com
prised everything that would be given
to any one.
The advices from Madrid, together
with the authoritative statement here,
left no room for doubt as to what had
occurred. The request for General
Lee's recall is understood to have
come within the last few days, and
doubtless since the last Cabinet meet
ing on Friday, as no reference to it
was made at that time. It came

CONFLICT WITH SPAIN IS NOW NEAR
MAINE'S STARBOARD
TURRET LOCATED
Found to Have Been Blown Clear
Off the Battleship by the
Tremendous Force of
the Explosion.
Copyrighted, 1898, by James Gordon Bennett.
HAVANA, March 6.â The Maine's starboard turret has been located
by the divers, as already indicated by the Herald and CaJl. It is found
to have been blown clear off the ship, and now lies upturned on its side
and sunk deep in the mud. The present position is regarded as one
more proof of the tremendous force the explosion exerted in the direc
xinn of port to starboard. The ship's carpenter, George Helens, who has
been here since Wednesday under special orders, has made a careful
inspection of the wreck. He was detailed to this duty because of his
perfect familiarity on portions of the vessel. Though Helens has not
yet made an official report or appeared before the co-urt since he first
testified a week ago, I understand that he has privately confirmed the
statement of Ensign Powelson in reference to the present position of the
Maine's bottom plates and the shattered condition of the ship's keel.
Naval Inspector Hoover is aboard the Mangrove with the Court of In
quiry, and his views will also be consulted on points involving structu
ral evidence.
The discontinuance of work by the tug Right Arm, I learn, was due
to a disagreement between Captain Magee of that craft and Captain
Sigsbee of the Maine. Magee. it is said, refused to let his men convey
bodies as recovered from the wreck to the dead barge a few hundred
yards away, asserting that the contract did not call for such duty. It
was then decided to dispense with the service of Captain Magee and his
boat. The wreck Is now being dismantled rapidly, and work below the
water line is made proportionately easier. Tons of copper pipe have
already been removed. This material is said to be worth from 18 to 20
cents a pound, but there appears to be no intention to try to realize any
revenue from it. In fact, orders are already issued to carry it several
miles outside the mouth of the harbor, and there dump it in the sea.
There is considerable criticism at this course. Among other sugges
tions, it has been proposed that such material should be saved and sold
for the benefit of the families of the lost men on the battleship, but
from all I can learn nothing of the sort is likely to be done.
The dispatch boat Fern will leave Havana harbor soon to carry re
lief stores to Matanzas and vicinity. Her place here will then be taken
probably by the coast survey steamer Bache, which sailed for Key
W.st again this afternoon, carrying five bodies of victims for inter
ment there. The Ward Line steamer City of Washington, whose offi
cers and passengers rendered splendid service o-n the night of the Maine
disaster, was in port a few hours again yesterday, en route from Mexico
to New York, and Judge Advocate Marix and several of the Maine's
officers, who are still here, embraced the opportunity to make calls of
courtesy on Captain Stevens and his men.
this case is Senor Dv Bosc. the Spanish
Charge d' Affaires. Dv Bosc had re
ceived no instructions on this subject,
and was in complete ignorance of the
demands made through Minister
Woodford. The other suggestion of the
Spanish Government, that relief sup
plies should not be sent in warships,
did not come through Minister Wood
ford, as the Madrid dispatches state,
but was presented by Senor Dv Bosc to
the State Department last Friday.
The responses in both cases went di
rect to Minister Woodford. There was
no loss of time, however, in assembling
a special session of the Cabinet, or even
in any general conference between the
President and his Cabinet advisers in
dividually. In the protest against the
Montgomery and Nashville Judge Day
conferred with Secretary Long, who in
turn called In Captain Crowninshield,
Chief of the Bureau of Navigation.
There appears to be no reason why
a change should be made in the plan
for sending these ships on their mis
ston, and without attaching signifi
cance to the request of the Spanish
(J'lVt-rnment the answer was made
that the plans for the tri^ were com
pleted, and that the stay of the ships
would be brief and of the most pacific
character.
In response to the request for Gen
eral Lee's recall the President does not
seem to have deemed the subject open
to such discussion as would require the
views of his Cabinet associates, and
after a brief exchange between the
White House and the State Department
the negative answer was dispatched to
Minister Woodford. One phrase of the
incident that tends to show the firm
stand taken by the administration is
the expedition with which the action
was accomplished. Such a matter or
dinarily is laid before the Cabinet, the
views of all its members personally
given, and the fullest opportunity af
forded for discussion. But in this ca.ee,
the press bulletin furnished to some
members of the Cabinet was the first
information that General Lee's service
was open to question. Before the Cab
inet meeting, no hint or complaint of
any kind relating to General Lee had
been made.
The ground on which General Lee's
recall was asked is not officially dis
closed. It is known, however, that the
Spanish Government has chafed for
some time over General Lee's presence
in Havana, although it had never takeÂ»n
the form of a definite protest prior to
the present time. It began to assume
a more serious aspect shortly after the
arrival of the Maine at Havana. At
that time General Lee escorted Captain
Sigsbee on his round of official calls.
These were made with due formality,
but the Spanish officials took offense
when the calls were restricted to Gen
eral Blanco, Admiral Manterola and the
representatives of the military arm of
Spain's s-ervice, and did not include
Premier Galvez and his associates of
the Autonomist Cabinet, who repre
sented the new civil regime which
Spain is seeking to enforce. The mat
tor came to the attention of Senor
Dupuy de Lome, the Spanish Minister
at Washington, and although there
was no protest the situation doubtless
reached the State Department, as suit
able amends were made by Captain
Sigsbee's calling on Dr. Congosto, the
civil secretary general, Premier Galvez
and his associates.
There was like irritation over a din
ner given by Consul-General Lee to the
officers of the Maine. The list of guests
on that occasion is said to have omit
ted some of the Spanish naval officers,
and to have included, quite conspicu
ously, the names of a number of Amer-
ican newspaper correspondents who
were regarded by the Spanish officials
at Havana as antagonistic to them.
This was also brought to the attention
of the officials, but was not made the
basis for any action, but rather of un
official Spanish criticism of General
Lee's general mode of procedure.
Within recent days it has been under
stood by officials here that the feeling
against General Lee has been smoothed
over, and the request for his recall was
for that reason in the nature of a com
plete surprise. There are circumstances
which clearly disclose the grounds for
the recall, although it is not known
that Spain has made any exact speci
fication of complaint. Since the Maine
disaster a report has been circulated
that General Lee held the personal opin
ion that the explosion was due to ex
ternal causes. No official report of this
character was ever sent to Washington
so far as is known, but the mere circu
lation of the report at Madrid attribu
ting such views to General Lee has been
the source of much feeling in Spanish
official circles. The press dispatches
from Madrid also disclose that General
Lee is held accountable at the Spanish
capital for the project of the purchase
of Cuba by the United States from
Spain as well as for a general senti
ment of sympathy toward the insur
gents. The suggestion of the Impar-
clal, a leading Government organ, that
the next sitting of the Cortes will con
sider the case of General Lee, shows
the strong influences which induced the
Sagasta Cabinet to ask for his recall.
In this connection the fact is noted
that Senor Dupuy de Lome is due in
Spain at this time. His enforced re
tirement on a demand of the United
States is felt to have awakened a
counter sentiment at Madrid which
finds expression against Consul-General
Lee. There is little doubt also that such
advice as Senor de Lome would give
to the Government or to the press in
public in Madrid would not be condu
cive toward the retention of General
Lee. There Is little doubt, however,
that the main cause of Spain's action
is the sympathy General Lee has shown
for the Cuban sufferers. It is known
that his active and open sympathy with
the people who have suffered so great
ly during the present insurrection,
American citizens as well as native
Cubans, has not been accepted by the
Spanish officials in Cuba as an exhi
bition of disinterested officialism, such
as is expected of Consular officers.
There were complaints of his conduct
during General Weyler's administra
tion, but never in full official form.
As a matter of fact Spain required no
formal excuse for the dismissal of a
Consular officer, according to interna
tional law. These officers are not en
dowed usually with diplomatic privil
eges, and" they exist entirely by the suf
ferance of the nations to which they
are sent. It is not necessary nor usual
to request their home Government to
recall them. They live officially only
through an exequateur granted by the
Government to which they are accred
ited, and this may be withdrawn at any
moment. So Consul-General Lee may
be dismissed from his post at the pleas-
ure of the Spanish Government, and
this would not violate any section of
international law. But he is in one re
spect unique, in that he is endowed
with semi-diplomatic powers, by the
wish of our Government and by the
consent of the Spanish Government.
The request of the Spanish Government
for his recall may, therefore, be re
garded as tantamount to a demand for
the recall of objectionable Ministers
such, for instance, as was Senor Dupuy
de Lome. There must be some substan
tial or satisfactory reason for such a
demand in such cases, and as those pre
sented against General Lee probably
were confined to the acts he has so far
performed with the full sanction and
approval o President McKinley, the
demand was not entertained, as is
clearly shown in the statement given
out by Assistant Secretary Day, Un
der such circumstances the incident
would close unless Spain took the de
cisive step of insisting on General Lee's
recall, and, this failing, giving him his
exequatcur.
This radical course is not expected,
however, and all the indications reach
ing officials here are that Spain will not
proceed further with the incident.

THE BkN FRANCISCO GALL. M^XDAY, MARCH 7, 1898.
CRISIS HOVERS
OVER THE NATION
Statesmen Believe That Developments
of the Next Few Days Will Settle
the Question of a Conflict
With Spain.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, March 6.
Talk of war with Spain was heard
wherever groups of Congressmen con
gregated in public places to-night. The
cry of New York extra papers by news
boys brought an unusual number of
people down into the business part of
the city, and the hotel lobbies were
soon filled with members of Congress
and Government officials.
The expressions of opinion heard to
night were diverse, but the general be
lief is that a crisis is at hand, and the
developments of the next few days will
settle the question of a conflict with
Spain. The belief was expressed in
some quarters that the President might
send a special message to Congress to
morrow and lay before that body the
correspondence of this Government
with Spain concerning the request for
General Lee's recall, and the counter
manding of the order to the Montgom
ery and Nashville. But the prevailing
belief among Congressmen is that he
will send no message at this time, for
there Is no necessity for it. The Presi
dent has, of course, full power to ex
ercise his executive functions in both
matters, and needs no authority or ad
vice from Congress, besides it is be
lieved that the sending of a special
message would only aggravate the sit
uation, by emphasizing its gravity and
might incite Congress to hasty and ill
advised action.
Although most members of Congress
believe that war is Inevitable, a few
were found to-night who argued that
Spain's request for General Lee's re
call need not aggravate the trouble,
and they -cited many cases wherein
diplomats had been given their pass
ports without causing any breach be
tween nations. The Call correspondent
asked a member of the Foreign Affairs
Committee of the House what would be
Spain's probable course in dealing with
the "obnoxious" Consul-General Lee,
and he replied:
"When the presence of a diplomat
becomes distasteful to the Government
to which he iB accredited, that nation
need only express this fact, without
stating the reasons therefor: and the
objectionable diplomatic representative
is usually recalled by his home gov
ernment, but if the request for his re
call is refused he is handed his pass
ville 1b looked upon by officials here as
much less grave than that affecting
General Lee. Secretary Long said to
night he did not regard the question
as to what ship should carry the relief
supplies as serious in any way, or as
likely to present any perplexing issues.
The desire of the Navy Department,
Mr. Long said, was merely to get the
supplies to Cuba on the most available
vessel. There were three of these now
at Key Westâ the Montgomery, Nash
ville and Fernâ alike available for the
service, and one of these, Mr. Long
said, would be designated for the trip.
The Fern is a dispatch boat, an un
armed naval vessel, and her availabil
ity for this mission had not previously
been suggested. Her choice would
probably remove all ground for objec
tion, as she has none of the character
istics of a war vessel. Mr. Long said,
however, that the only decision thus
far reached was that one of the naval
vesselsâ Montgomery. Nashville or
Fernâ should make the trip.
As this is the first time public men
tion has been made of the Fern in con
nection with carrying the supplies it
might be inferred that she will make
the trip. The official orders, however,
continue to stand as they were origi
nally made, designating the Montgom
ery and Nashville, but these could be
changed readily if the Fern was be
lieved to be best suited for the work.
The naval officers have felt from the
first that the Montgomery and Nash
ville were illy adapted for carrying sup
plies. They are essentially fighting ma
chines, and every inch of available
room is taken by their own supplies of
cordage, canvas and coal. This was so
apparent that the plans contemplated
putting the relief supplies on deck, cov
ering them with tarpaulins and trust
ing to the weather and a quick trip to
keep the* provisions and clothing from
damage. The Fern, not being essen
tially a fighting machine, but more of
the type of a yacht for the speedy con
veyance of naval dispatches, has con
siderably more room for the stowing
of supplies, both below and on deck.
The Cuban relief committee counted
on sending seventy-five tons to Key
West, but this has now been increased
to one hundred tons. It left New York
on one of the Mallory line of boats yes
terday and is due at Key West next
Wednesday. The transfer will take a
day, and the plan has been to have the
Government ship start next Thursday
for Cuba.
The decision of the administration to
send supplies to the reconcentrados in
Cuba was arrived at early in the week.
General Lee had represented that he
had been unable to distribute the
goods that had been received in answer
to the proclamation of the President
to the American people. He reported
that many tons of these supplies were
stored in Havana and culd not be for
warded to the eastern end of the Isl
and. The United States Consuls at
Matanzas and Sagua la Grande had
come In person to Havana to seek for
relief after reporting to the State De
partment the terrible conditions exist
ing in their respective districts.
The State Department immediately
instituted inquiries, and, learning that
the original decree of the Spanish Gov
ernment authorizing th^ free admission
of supplies applied only to the port of
Havana, obtained permission for the
free reception of these supplies at all
ports.
The next obstacle met was the diffi
culty of transhipping th([ goodÃ from
ports. There have been several in
stances in which the United States
expressed its dissatisfaction with Min
isters resident and other nations have
likewise asked this Government to re
call its representatives. Notable cases
being those of ex-Senator Henry W.
Blair, whose rejection by China was
made before he sailed for his post of
duty. A case not so recent was that
of Sargent of California, who was re
jected by Germany. It is universally
recognized that a nation has the right
to reject any diplomatic representa
tive who is distasteful without assign
ing any reasons for this displeasure,
and it must be conceded that Spain has
the same right to ask for General Lee's
recall that we had for asking Spain to
withdraw Senor De Lome. It is true
that our reason in the case of De Lome
was a valid one, for he was proven
guilty of a flagrant breach of diplo
matic propriety, while General Lee has
not thus been miilty of any such im
propriety. But that fact cannot be
urged, for Spain in her note did not
assign any reasons, merely declaring
that they would like to have Lee with
drawn because his presence is felt to
be prejudicial to Spain's interests. My
opinion is that following custom and
precedents, the United States Govern
ment had no right to ask Spain to
specify her reasons, and the President
probably looked at it this? way too.
The flat refusal of President McKinley
to comply with Spain's request would
ordinarily result in nothing but the
issuance of passports to Consul-Gen
eral Lee. but the request of Spain that
we transport supplies to Cuba in mer
chant vessels, and countermand the
orders to the Montgomery and Nash
ville, is quite a different matter, and
likely to lead to serious results, inas
much as the President Is determined to
send these vessels to Cuba. What fate
will befall them? Will they be regard
ed as men of war or as transports
coming to Cuba on a humane mission?
"The President is. doubtless, right in
his belief that the Spanish Government
will not dare to harm them, for this
would visit upon the head <>f that na
tion the detestation and condemnation
of the whole civilized world. No. you
may depend upon it. they will not be
molested by any orders of the Spanish
Government, but it is more than likely
that President McKinley'a reply to
Spain, which, in fact, amounts to a
defiance, will incense the Spanish Gov
ernment, and that her displeasure will
soon be manifest â d. President Me-
Havana eastward, there being only a
semi-weekly service by steamship and
that subject to many vexatious local
restrictions. When the United States
cruiser Montgomery returned from her
cruise, which included the Cuban ports
of Matanzas and Santiago, the officers
brought harrowing tales of the distress
existing there. Captain Crowninshield,
the chief of the Navigation Bureau of
the Navy Department, an officer of the
soundest discretion and judgment, was
on the ship, an accidental passenger.
He told President McKinley directly
what he had learned. The result was
the immediate derision of the Navy De
partment to accede to the request of
the relief committee in New York to
forward its supplies to the eastern
ports of Cuba. One of the American
lines of steamships running to New
York had offered to take the bounteous
contributions of the American people
to Key West, and the President him
self gave the order for their carnage to
Eastern Cuba by any of the available
ships of the North Atlantic squadron.
The announcement by the press of
the purpose of the Government to send
supplies to Cuba on naval vessels was
made last Wednesday. Within twenty
four hours there were signs of resist
ance on the part of the Spanish Gov
ernment. At first this took the shape
of an informal inquiry by the Spanish
Charge d'Affaires as to the correctness
of the report, the inquiry being couched
in an Incredulous tone; and later, when
the affirmation came, there was lodged,
not a formal protest, but rather an in
sinuation that the movement of the
naval ships would not be acceptable;
that It would be construed into an act
of active sympathy on the part
of the Government of the United
States with the insurgents. But
the President had satisfied him
self that the course he had chosen â
that of sending the supplies in a naval
vessel â was the only one that promised
sufficient and prompt relief. There was
no time for polite diplomatic exchange
of notes when, according to General
Lee's advice, people were perishing
from hunger by hundreds every day in
Cuba, and the Spanish Charge was so
informed.
Senor dv Bosc,Â« when seen at the
Spanish Legation to-day, could add lit
tle to the fund of information on the
two subjects which were attracting so
much official and public attention. He
had received no word from his Govern
ment concerning General Lee, and he
stated positively that no suggestions
concerning General LeÂ«'s retirement
had been submitted to him by the
State Department. As to the sending
of relief supplies by the Montgomery
and Nashville, Mr. Dv Bosc said he felt
that merchant vessels were much bet
ter equipped for such service, and their
use was not open to that misconstruc
tion possible in sending supplies by
vessels of the navy.
The news concerning General Lee
aroused the deepest interest, and no lit
tle excitement throughout Washington,
and far the time being the usual quiet
of Sunday evening was put aside. Ir
hotel corridors, at the clubs and in all
nublic places it was the absorbing top
ic, and not since the Maine disaster has
such widespread popular interest
been evinced in the Spanish situation.
LIKELY TO LEAD TO
SERIOUS RESULTS.
NEW YORK, March 6.â General
Kinley has practically said to Spain:
'It is your move.' I believe that Spain s
answer will be a declaration of war."
The Call correspondent saw Senator
Perkins and Congressman Hilborn to
night. Both of them, being members
of the Naval Affairs Committee, have
had several conferences with the Presi
dent, and the fact that they are un
usually reticent leads to the belief that
they have been talking with the Presi
dent about the emergency measures
which the Secretary of the Navy is tak-
ing
Hilborn said that Secretary Long
wo-uld probably enlist the whole num
ber of men asked for (1500) without
waiting for the bill's passage. Eight
hundred enlistments were provided for
to-day. Hilborn saw the Chief of the
Naval Ordnance Bureau, and endeav
ored to impress upon him the necessity
of purchasing from foreign factories a
laree amount of smokeless powder be
fr-re the foreign market is closed against
us by the neutrality laws. Hilborn is
fearful that the combined daily output
of 2500 pounds by the Dupont factory
and the California Powder Works
would be totally inadequate to fill the
magazines of our warships, and he be
lieves that a large supply must be fur
nished from a factory in Sweden. A
letter received by him from the Santa
Cruz, Cal., company stated that the fac
tory would soon be ready to turn out a
thousand pounds a day, and twice that
amount, by working nights also. But
even if they have been working stead
ily for the last few weeks, they cannot
have a very large supply on hand, and
at the rate of 1000 or 2000 pounds per
day it would take several months to
furnish any considerable quantity.
Therefore he insists that it is absolutely
essential that a supply be purchased
abroad as soon as possible. He says
the powder produced by the Santa Cruz
company is of excellent quality, manu
factured exactly according to the Rus
sian formula, which was experimented
upon at Newport, R. 1., but that the
I>upont Company has not yet succeed
ed so well, and the powder produced by
them is of inferior quality.
From a remark made by Hilborn to
night, it is believed that President Mc-
Kinley and Secretary Long have been
sounding members of the Naval Af
fairs Committee on a proposition to
build a large number of torpedo boats,
which can be constructed in this coun
try within the next few months.
Daniel E. Sickles, who was? Minister of
the United States to Spain from 1569
to 1874, durintr which period occurred
the strained relations between that
country and the United States over the
Virginius affair, said to-day that
Spain's request for the recall of Con
sul-General Lee was a serious move
and likely to lead to serious results.
"Is not such an action at this time,
following as it does, close upon the
De Lome incident and the Maine dis
aster, sure to precipitate a war?" Gen
eral SickPls was asked.
"Not at all. It is merely a diplomatic
incident. President McKinley is at
liberty to refuse to recall General Lee,
and in that case Spain would be per
fectly justified in handing him his
passports on the single ground that he
is persona non grata.
"Do you consider that this move
on Spain's part puts this country
nearer war than it was over the Vir
ginius affair?"
"Not at all. If anything, we were
nearer war at that time than now. I
do not regard the request as a casus
belli, and it is no more than their
right to demand that if we send sup
plies to these people, they shall be sent
by merchant vessels. The use of war
ships at such a time might justly be
regarded as a hostile act upon our
P art " . â¢
STATESMEN APPLAUD
M'KINLEY'S COURSE.
His Refusal to Recall General
Lee Gives Satisfaction in Every
Quarter.
WASHINGTON. March 6.â Speaking
of the Madrid dispatch made public by
Assistant Secretary Day, Chairman
Davis said:
"It Is a circumstance which, added
to the present strained conditions,
makes things more vexatious. I ap
prove the President's action in every
particular."
Senator Pettigrew said: "I certainly
approve the President's course in the
matter. I should judge the request to
recall our Consul-General is somewhat
unusual and under other circumstances
would be complied with, but the con
ditions precedent to this case took It
out of the usual rule and justified the
President's action. I think that, in
view of the fact that It is conceded the
Maine was blown up, the President
would be justified in sending battleships
loaded with combustibles, as well as
food, and filled with armed men. It
seems to me we cannot accept any set
tlement short of the Independence of
Cuba." T , ..
Senator Cullom said: "I regard the
course pursued by the President in an
swer to the Spanish Government as
right, justified by all the conditions and
the American people will indorse him in
the position he has taken. I have be
lieved for some time that we were near
ing a crisis from day to day, and it
has seemed to me that the Spanish
Government was endeavoring to bring
on a conflict between that Government
and ours. Whether this Government
desires it or not, on this account, it
would be almost forced into war with
Spain. I do not well understand, in
view of the manifestation of interest
this country has taken in the conflict
which has been going on between Spain
and the Cubans, how a withdrawal of
any kind could be thought of. either
from the point of view of national in
terest or of common humanity. Our
people do not want war, neither does
the President, but neither the President
nor the people will submi* to any hu
miliation at the hands of the Spaniards.
I think it is another step on their part
into forcing an issue between that Gov
ernment and our own."

ENGLAND WOULD
SUPPORT AMERICA
In the Event of a Conflict With
Spain the United States
Would Have Great Brit=
am's Good Will-
NEW YORK, March 6.â A Washington special to the Herald says:
In view of the possibility of war between the United States and Spain,
there has been a great deal of speculation in Washington as to the at
titude likely U> be assumed by other European powers, and especially
by Great Britain. There has been no idea that Great Britain would be
actively drawn into such a war in any way, and it is now generally be
lieved that the United States would have her moral support and sym-
The news of the Maine disaster was received in Great Britain with
almost as much horror as in the United States. It was noted at the
time that the first expression of sympathy received at the State De
partment was from Sir Julian Pauncefote, the British Embassador,
who, without waiting to learn whether the Spanish Government was in
any way involved, called in person at the State Department. This was fol
lowed by a message from the Queen, a message from the Prince of
Wales and from many high officials and officers of the army and navy.
An American naval officer of high rank, who has just returned
from a cruise during which he associated a great deal with English
persons and with officers of the British army and navy, referring to
the warm feeling that the English have for the United States in this
crisis, said to me:
"To the observer of current events in this country and in England
no more striking thought makes itself felt than the good fellowship evi
denced by the average intelligent Englishman for American and, most
things American. Without a doubt, there is more friendship felt and
expressed in England for America than in America for England. For,
unfortunately, it is become the fashion to deride everything English and
to scoff at England and the English from whatever point of view the
thought takes its rise. But. soberly speaking, it would seem, aside
from any tinge of sentimentality, that the two English-speaking na
tions of the world should properly stand shoulder to shoulder in any fu
ture contest from a military, commercial or political point of view."
POWELSON'S
CLEAR PROOF
AS TO CAUSE
Continued from First Page.
formulate certain predictions which I
believe will be verified in all essential
particulars. The court is practically
certain to report that the Maine disas
ter was not an accident. I believe it
equally certain to indicate clearly facts
which prove the primary explosion to
have been under the ship's bottom and
not over it. The court is not likely to
fasten the act on any person or per
sons, much less to attribute it directly
to any representatives of the Spanish
Government. Its report will probably
be unanimous. On this last point there
is some controversy among naval offi
cers Captain Chadwick is by common
report believed to have assumed a more
conservative attitude toward Powel
son's evidence than any other member
of the court, though the best informa
tion available at present represents
him as being now thoroughly in line
with his colleagues and convinced as
they are that no interior explosion
wrought the destruction.
It is believed by some well informed
officers, however, that Lieutenant Com
mander Potter *night not unnoticeably
be influenced by the judgment of Cap
tain Chadwick, who is his immediate
and only superior in rank in command
of the flagship at Key West, Potter be
ing the executive officer.
There seems to be some doubt now
whether the Maine's guns, even after
they have been recovered by the wreck
ing apparatus, will ever be fit for serv
ice. â  During the fire that swept through
the battle-ship after the explosion they
were subjected to an intense heat. A
practical expert in Key West recently
told me that to render them fit for use
again they would have to be annealed
and practically recast. This would in
volve considerable expense, but without
it my informant said he doubted
whether any gunner in the fleet would
care to assume the responsibility of
firing one of them either at target
practice or in active service.
Ten arrests on political charges have
been made in Havana between mid
night Friday and Saturday, and there
is some excitement in consequence.
Aside from Honore Lame, whose sec- j
ond incarceration I reported yesterday,
the more important suspects detained
are Senor Estrada, who was released
under the amnesty proclamation not
â¢long ago from Chafarinas, and an al
leged former insurgent named Pardo.
The other prisoners are for the most
part accused of participating in rebel
lion.
This renewed activity of the police is
regarded as foreshadowing the more
stringent policy of the autonomist gov
ernment against political offenders.
Lame, it is said, will probably be per
mitted to leave the island on the next
steamer. He is a French subject.
The Herald of February 17 print
ed a sectional view of the Ameri
can battle-ship, showing the location of
the magazines, coal and stores. The
plan was reproduced here in the Diario
del Ejerclto ; February 19, and yester
day a clipping from the latter was
posted in the Havana Produce Ex
change, and under it was written a no
tice to the effect that it is time all loyal
Spaniards took note of such informa
tion concerning American ships. Re
liable persons who were among the
crowd which welcomed the Oquendo
yesterday heard cries: "Let more
Maines come to Havana now."
A letter received at the American
Consulate for Joseph H. Lane yester
day was marked under the address,
"Probably one of the survivors of the
Maine." A blue pencil mark of the
Spanish postoffice under the address
announced some postage still due and
the same pencil wrote under the sur
vivor words "I hope he is not." Lane
was one of the wounded men taken to
Key West. He says the roar of rockets
and cadence of the military awoke Ha
vana this Sunday morning, and at sun
rise the harbor was alive with all craft
summoned by signals flying at Morro,
announcing the arrival of another ship
It turned out not to be the expected
cruiser Cristobal Colon, but the Alfonso
XIII of the Spanish line. Her decks
were thronged with fifteen hundred sol
diers from Spain. As she moved to an
chorage tugs shot out from the pierd
with crashing bands on board and
rocket batteries afloat and ashore
roared a welcome to the new regiments
which Spain pours to the Western
world to the wonder of all nations.
Tugs circled the Alfonso XIII, the
bands playing patriotic airs. The sol
diers replied with a mighty cheer as
the ship crept by the trim cruiser Viz
caya and Oquendo, and across the
smooth water from Morro and Cabanas
and the awakening city floated the mu
sic of bugles and far-flung cheers with
which Havana greeted the friends in
need. The officers and sailors on the
Mangrove and Fern at anchor under
the cruiser's guns hung over the rails
and silently watched the Alfonso steam
to her berth, and here and there a
light-hearted American tar waltzed to
the Spanish music. Altogether it was
a spirited spectacle. I could but notice
that troublous times made the welcome
of the soldiers warmer and longer sus
tained than it would have been a few
weeks ago. For an hour rockets and
batteries were never silent and the
bugles sang the accompaniment of the
steeple bells ashore. Sleep had given
place to activity in all craft in the har
bor, except two. These were the shat-^
tered Maine under the half-masted
Stars and Stripes, and the barge laden
with coffins, which lies at anchor near
by, awaiting the battle-ship's unrecov
ered dead.
The wreckers on the barges beside the
Maine began once more to work, which
even Sunday does not interrupt, an.l
the Herald-Call dispatch boat moved
out again past Morro, leaving the city
as peaceful as the waters of its land
locked harbor.
CONSUL BARKER SAID
TO HAVE RESIGNED.
Apathy of the American Government
Is Given as the Probable
Cause.
NEW YORK, March 6.â Walter B.
Barker, United States Consul at Sagua
La Grande, says a Havana dispatch,
has resigned, it is said, because of dis
satisfaction with the policy of the
American Government. The dispatch
says that the Government's apathy
is expected to result in other resigna
tions.

Force.
The pending difficulties between Spain
and the United States may, If reports
of warships for sale are to be believed,
prove a veritable bonanza to ship
buiVders in Europe, as well as to some
of the impecunious naval powers of the
Old and New World. With the ship
builders it ia simply a matter of busi
ness to get the highest price for the
Bhips built on speculation or ordered by
governments which have defaulted on
payments, but in the sale of national
vessels other objects besides realizing
on expensive luxuries may have much
to do with the transfer of ships to
either Spain or the United States.
In the appended list of naval vessels
belonging 1 to, or being built for, the
countries indicated, only such as are of
modern construction have been taken
cognizance of. The line of demarka
tion between the old and new navies
may be drawn at 1880, prior to which
very few of the ships built come up to
the requirements of the present time,
and this applies particularly to armored
ships which have progressed from sim
ple ironclads to compound armor, all
steel, and finally to Ilarveyized steei
armor affording triple the protection of
like weight and thickness used twenty
years ago. Another important factor â
that of specd â has been gradually de
veloped, and the high-speed vessel of
fourteen knots two decades ago is anti
quated and useless now when pitted
against eighteen to twenty-four knot
cruisers and thirty-two knot torpedo
boat destroyers.
As to armament each country has its
preference of what constitutes the best
and most efficient, as also which guns
are best suited tor particular kinds of
v.-sseis. The guns of large and small
caliber in foreign ships, outside of Eu
rope, are a mixture of Armstrong,
Whittworth, Krupp and French, being
supplied where the ships were built.
The relative merits of the various types
f ordnance are, like those of the ar
orclads, cruisers and torpedo-boats,
very much matters of opinions and
have yet to be practically tested, but
the list of ships given enumerates a
number which are quite up to the mod
ern standard of efficiency acceptable to
any country able to pay for them if
needed to augment the naval defense.
In the classification of ships enumer
ated the following abbreviations have
been made us of in the column of
class:
For armored vessels â a. cr., armored

It is within the bounds of possibility
that Italy might not be averse to sell
ing a number of its naval vessels. The
"nances of that country are in a very
bad state, and within two years Or-
jando Bros., Leghorn, have sold vessels
* contracted for by Italy to the Argentine
Republic and Spain; namely the Gari
baldi and San Martino to Argentine,
and the Cristobal Colon to Spain. The
modern fleet of Italy is composed of
fine ships, and the list given below em
braces eleven armored vessels of 102,523
tons; fifteen cruisers of 41.333 tons, and
twenty-six other vessels of 15,386 tons,

â¢Building.
The date of launch gives a pretty fair
ideaâ in the absence, of definite infor
mation â as to stage of completion.
Thus, all armored ships launched prior
to 1896 may be assumed to be com
pleted or nearly so, and cruisers and
other craft launched before 1896 to be
ready for service. The condition of
vessels launched last year depends very
much upon how the i^spective govern
ments have met the payments due, and
also upon who the builders are. Thus,
the vessels building for China, namely,
two cruisers of 4300 tons at Elswh k,
and three cruisers of 2850 at Stettin,
were contracted to be delivered in eigh
teen and fifteen months respectively;
the Elswick cruisers thus being due in
July next, and the Stettin cruisers be
ing due now. Both firms are likely to
be on time if the Chinese Government
has met its obligations, and thee: five
fine cruisers may be classed as being
in the market. The Hai-Chi and her
sister ship are very ambitious designs
of protected cruisers; they have a
length over all of 424 feet, forty-six feet
eight inches beam, and a mean draught
of sixteen feet nine inches. The pro
pelling power consists of twin-screws
driven by triple-expansion vertical en
gines to develop 17,000 horsepower and a
speed of twenty-four knots under
forced draught and twenty-two and a
half knots on natural draught. The
protective deck is three inches thick on
slopes over machinery, five inches over
cylinders and one and a half inches
elsewhere. The conning tower is six
inches in thickness. The armament
consists of two eight-inch quick firing
rifles mounted on middle line forward
and aft, each having a train of 135 de
grees on either side of the middle line.
In addition there are two 4.7-lnch
rapid-firers in broadside of which the
two forward and after guns have a
train from directly ahead or astern to
forty-five degrees abaft the beam, and
the remaining six broadside guns have
an arc of fire of 120 degrees. The sec
ondary battery includes sixteen three
pounders, six one-pounders and five
torpedo tubes, of which latter one is in
the bow and two on each broadside.
These vessels are to have a bunker ca
pacity of 1200 tons, sufficient to a
steaming radius of 2100 knots at full
speed and 8000 knots at ten knots per
hour. Their total cost, including arma
ment, equipment and outfit, is $1, 638,351
for each vessel.
The three protected cruisers building
at the Vulcan, Stettin, will have engines
of 8000 horse-power, the batteries â from
Elswlckâ are to consist of three 5.9 inch,
eight 4 inch, six 1.4 inch quick-firing
guns and four torpedo tubes. The pro
tective deck is 2\b inches in its thick
est part, and the guns have 2 inch steel
protection. Their bunker capacity is
about 400 tons, and the oflicers and
crew number 250. The cost of each ship
is about $1,000,000, exclusive of guns.
The four torpedo boat destroyers were
contracted for in December, 1896, to be
delivered in thirteen months. They are
being built by Scnickau, Elbing, and
will have 6000 horse-power and 32 knots
speed. Their completion may be looked
for any day, and would be very desir
able acquisitions.
Turning a covetous glance at Chile's
new navy, the Esmeralda, built at Els
wick, is a particularly fine specimen of
modern warships. She is an armored
cruiser of 7020 tons, 18,000 horse-power
and 23 knots' speed. Brassey classes
her as one of the most powerful crui
sers in the world. Her armor belt is
Harveyized steel, 6 inches maximum
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL., MONDAY, MARCH 7, 1898.
thickness, 7 feet in- depth, extending
350 feet and terminating with 6-inch
bulkheads. A curved armored deck lVi
to 2 inches thick protects the machin
ery. The coal bunkers, with a capac
ity of 1350 tons, are above the protective
deck, and add to the protection of the
ship. The armament is entirely Els
wick quick-firing guns, and consists of
two 8-inch â one forward and one aft â
with 8-inch shields; sixteen 6-inch, with
4*>fc-lnch shields, four o-f which are on
the flying deck firing forward and aft,
and twelve are in broadside on the up
per deck. The secondary battery con
sists of eight 12-pounderi#, ten 6-pound
ers and four Maxim guns. She has
also a bow torpedo tube, and one on
each side. The steaming efficiency of
the ship may be realized from the fact
that she made a little over 23 knots un
der natural draught. The gun trials,
prior to acceptance, took place Decem
ber 16, 1596, and among other tests one
8-inch and four 6-inch guns were fired
simultaneously in the line of the keel,
the guns being laid level, both ahead
and astern. The Esmeralda would be
a good bargain at $3,000,000, and would
look better under the Stars and Stripes
than under the- flag of San Jago.
As for the O'Higgins building at
Elswick since January, 1897, this ship
is not likely to be so near completed
as to be wanted for immediate use, for
even the Elswick Company with its un
surpassed facilities would not undertake
to build and complete a battleship of
8500 tons in less than two years un
less war prices were paid. The O'Hig
gins is 400 feet by 62 feet, and a
draught of 22 feet. The horse-power is
to be 16,500, and the speed 21 2 i knots
under natural draught. The hull pro
tection is a Harveyized steel belt 7
inches thick. The armament will in
clude four 8-inch, ten 6-inch and four
4.7-inch, all quick-firing guns, and the
smaller guns consist of eight 12-pound
ers, ten 6-pounders and four broadside
submerged torpedo tubes. The gun po
sitions <>f the 8 and 6 inch guns are of
6-inch nickel steel.
Another noted and desirable Chilean
ship is the Blanco Encalada, a protect
ed cruiser of 4420 tons. She is of the
same type but larger than the
Yoshino, Japanese cruiser, also built at
Elswick. She was launched in Sep
tember, 1893, and underwent her steam
trials without a hitch, in June. 1894,
and delivered within the contract time
of two years. Her horse-power Is 14.
600, speed under natural draught dur
ing twelve hours continued steaming
was 21% knots. The armament is two
8- inch â one on poop forward and one
on forecastle aft â ten 6-inch quick
firers in sponsons of which three on
f-ach broadside and two in the bows
and two in the quarters, twelve 3
pound^rs, twelve 1 -pounders, five tor
pedo tuboa and one torpedo boat of thp
third class. The protective deck is 1%
inches on the fiat, 4V 2 inches on the
slopes and the conningtower is 6 inches
thick.
The foregoing brief descriptions of
the salient points in notable and desir
able naval vessels will give some idea
of the requirements of a navy. In the
absence of accurate information as to
what the Governments of this country
and Spain are contemplating in the
purchasing of ships it is needless to
describe other vessels not yet spoken
of. If wp are to purchase ships we
should, however, get the best in the
market, and the purso of Uncle Sam
is in a far better plethoric state than
any other country to allow bargains to
slip away. With the Chinese cruisers
and torpedo boats and the Chilean
ships added to our existing navy we
should br> able to meet Spain on more
than equal terms and acquire some of
that country's armored cruisers and
torpedo crafts.
SECRETARY ALGER TO
COLONEL T.M. FISHER.
Files the Veteran Soldier's Letter
Offering His Services in the
Event of War.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., March 6.
â Colonel Thomas M. Fisher, now pros
ecuting attorney of this county, re
cently wrote to Secretary of War Al
ger, with whom he Is personally ac
quainted, tendering his services to the
War Department in any capacitw in
which they might be used in event of
hostilities with Spain. Colonel Fisher
served four years during, the late civil
war, most of that time as company
commander, and for five years after
ward was a lieutenant in the regular
army during the Indian wars under
General Crook and saw much service
of the same character of warfare as is
now being carried on in the island of
Cuba. In reply to his letter to the Sec
retary Colonel Fisher yesterday re
ceived the" following:
WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington D

your letter of the ISth inst. , offering your

Thinks America Unprepared.
LONDON, March 7.â The Daily Mall,
discussing the "probability that the
United States may goad Spain into
declaring war as a last desperate
move," says: "In America's unpre
pared condition, Spain could inflict ap
palling damage. Neither could conquer
the ether, and the utmost America
could gain would be the equivocal tri
umph of securing Cuban independence.
If Spain takes the first step, America
will have herself to thank."
UNITED STATES BARRACKS AT KEY WEST.
LATEST TRICK
OF SPANIARDS
Making a Pretense of In
vestigating the Maine
Disaster.
Divers Have Made Up Their
Minds and No Longer
Attempt to Work.
It Is Now Believed at Havana That
the United States Will First
AttÂ»ck There.
Special Dlapatcb to The Call.
HAVANA. March 6 (via Key West,
Fla.). â As the conviction becomes set
tled that the Court of Inquiry will de
cide that there was a mine explosion
under thf Maine, film iisslon among
American naval officers and civilian; *
here is prevalent as to the warlike
measures which it is believed the Unit
ed States Government will adopt in
case the question of the payment of
indemnity by Spain is overruled. A
majority believe that American troops
will be landed at some port east of
Havana and the insurgents communi
cated with, that the Spanish soldiery
will be defeated or captured in detail,
and that in the meantime a fleet of
United States vessels will blockade, if
not bombard Havana. No one seems to
doubt that the reduction of this city
would be comparatively easy. Four
twelve-inch guns, two west and two
east of the city, are the only ones that
are considered dangerous. These are
not likely to be well served, while their
emplacements are not modern.
That some Spaniards are of the opin
ion that an attack on Havana will be
made, is believed to be shown by the
abnormal activity displayed on board
the Vizcaya. One correspondent has
the best naval authority for the state
ment that the Vizcaya is in a constant
state of readiness for emergencies, and
that picket boats are on the alert day
and night inside the harbor and out
side the harbor at night.
It is pointed out that the men-of-war
Vizcaya and Almirante Oquendo might
be caught in a blockade and fall easy
prey to a United States fleet. The
cruiser Alfonso XIII is without boilers,
and would be of no account. All this
discussion of the probability of war
among the Americans and Spaniards
proves nothing, and only shows the
state of feeling here.
The conduct of the Spanish divers
who are investigating the wreck of the
Maine Is a mystery. Thus far, they
have not been down five hours in the
aggregate, and they show no disposi
tion to make a thorough inquiry.
It is impossible to learn the truth
fully regarding the purpose of the
Spanish court of inquiry, but it is gen
erally believed that the divers went
down for form's sake only and that
a report will be made In accordance
with instructions from Madrid. It may
be that the Spanish divers have dis
covered that the whole port side of
the Maine forward is gone, and, having
so reported, further examination is
deemed unnecessary. The work of our
own divers henceforward is bound to
be slow, owing to the ponderous weights
to be moved and the safety clamps,
nuts and rivets that must be cut.
Senator Proctor is likely to make a
speech in the Senate on his return that
will have great weight in determining
the future policy of the United States.
He is much affected by the suffering
that he found in Matanzas and highly
Indignant at what he calls the "inhu
manity of the course pursued."
During a visit to Artemisa, this prov
ince, he saw thousands of reconcentra
dos who refused to beg, though starv
ing. They were evidently of a class
accustomed to make their living and
unwilling to become paupers. He saw
thousands of acres of the best tobacco
and banana lands in the world reduced
to waste, with trochas and garrisons
at every village and cross-road. His
driver, pointing to the mountains miles
away, said: "There are plenty of in
surgent camps there that the Spanish
have never discovered."
The work of distribution of American
relief under Miss Clara Barton, Mr. El
well and their assistants is, in Senator
Proctor's Judgment, carefully and ef
fectively carried on. The demand is
far in excess of the supply. The sup
plies expected at Matanzas and Sagua
la Grande, to be brought by American i
cruisers, will afford unspeakable relief.
Now that the Almirante Oquendo and
the Vizcaya are lying in the harbor the
Spaniards exultingly declare that their
city is safe, and it is given out officially
in the newspapers that the new arrival
is of the same size, armament an*
complement as the Vizcaya,

Who Said Catholics Should

Special TMppatrh to The Call.
DENVER, March 6.â The biggest
gathering of Irish-American citizens
ever assembled in this city filled the
Broadway Theater this afternoon. The
occasion was the celebration of the
centennial anniversary of the Irish
rebellion of 1798. The orators were
Rev. T. H. Malone, S. J. Donlevy, na
tional vice-president of the Centennial
Association of America, T. M. Patter
son and P. J. Sheridan.
Father Malone's address was a crit
ical and historical review of the
movements of the United Irishmen. In
cidentally he alluded to the recent
speech of Father Weber of New York.
"As 'Irishmen and Irish-Americans,"
said Father Malone, "our cordial sym
pathy goes out to all people struggling
for freedom. As Irish Catholics we
cannot too severely condemn the words
of that misguided priest in New York
who said it was the duty of Catholics
to support Spain in a conflict with this
country. We stand for America against
every other country on earth, and the
prompt disclaimer of the 'great Arch
bishop of New York for responsibility
for the priest's utterance meets with
sincere response from the Catholics of
the West."
These sentiments were loudly
cheered.
S. J. Donlevy's ringing declaration
that Irish Nationalism was neither
Catholicism nor Protestantism was
loudly applauded. The speaker receiv
ed an ovation as he declared for an
"Irish republic, a free people, free land
and a nation self reliant in all essen
tials."
The addresses of Messrs. Patterson
and Sheridan were alteo well received.
A delegation was present from each
Irish-American organization in the
State. .
HONORE LAINEE IS
AGAIN IN CABANAS.
Arrest of a French Newspaper Man
Who Once Escaped Punish
ment at Havana.
Copyrighted, IS9B. by James Oordon BennPtt.
HAVANA, March 6.â Honore Lainee,
a French newspaper man, was ar
rested early this morning by Colonel
Pegliery, Chief of Police. Lainee was
immediately lodged in Cabanas fort
ress, as a political prisoner. M. Mar
tini, French Consul, was notified and
communicated with the French Min
ister at Washington. Cabanas fort
ress is no new lodging for Lainee. Two
years ago he came to Havana, saying
he was captured by the insurgents,
from whom he escaped after many dif
ficulties. His story was not believed.
He was arrested, charged with com
municating with the rebels and was
held incommunicado several days, and
th^n succeeded in getting word to the
French. The political charges against
Lainee seemed well founded, and
though well liked by all classes, his
execution was expected. Finally, after
establishing its position, Spain mag
nanimously released him, ordering him
to leave the island. Lainee had spent
nearly a year in Cabanas and seemed
content never to return. With Weyler
in Spain, Lainee applied for and re
ceived permission to return to Ha
vana. He has been under close sur
veillance by the police and his arrest
was not unexpected even to himself.
Essex Ordered to Portsmouth.
PORTSMOUTH. N. H., March 6.â
The United States steamship Essex has
been ordered to the Portsmouth Navy
Yard for repairs. Orders have been re
ceived at the navy yard to rush work

to have some old monitors sent here to
fit out. Commodore Remy is prepared
for any emergency, and one thousand

Cruiser Columbia Ordered to Sail for
Key West as Soon as
Possible.
Special DlsDatch to The Call.
PHILADELPHIA, March 6.â To-day
was a repetition of last Sunday in the
general activity at the League Island
Navy Yard. Workmen were busily en
gaged upon the cruiser Minneapolis,
the moi.itor Miantonomoh and the
ram Katahdin. In addition work
was going on in the mold loft,
and several forges were in operation in
the blacksmith shops. The utmost reti
cence prevailed among the officers,
sailors and workmen at the yard, and
It was impossible to obtain any official
information as to the detail of the work
going on. It was evident, however,
that all work was being hurried as
rapidly as possible.
The work on the Minneapolis and
Miantonomoh was all below decks and
was said to consist of repairs and in
spection of the machinery". On the
Katahdin, the standards for the rapid
firing guns were being erected and
some small repairs were going on be
low. The work in the mold loft con
sisted of attention to small boats and
spars.
The immense crowds which flocked
to the naval station last Sunday â  ere
largely increased to-day, but no one
was allowed to get close to the war
ships. Sentries were posted at the en
trance to the wharves and only work
men and those on business were al
lowed inside the lines.
The old single turret monitors in the
back channel â relics of the late war â
were an attraction to thousands, and
their decks were crowded all day. It
was reported that five of these will be
taken from their berths as soon as pos
sible and modern guns put aboard.
Those now in the turrets are of the
smooth-bore kind. The information as
to the trial of these boats came from
one of their caretakers, and was not
official. The boats which, it is said,
will be tried are the Mnntauk,' Jason,
Manhattan, Lehigh and Canonicus.
The purpose of the trial with modern
guns is to determine whether they will
maintain their center of gravity suffi
ciently to be available for use in any
emergency.
It was reported to-day that the
cruiser Columbia, now in dry dock, had
received orders to start for Key West
as soon as possible. This could not
receive official verification. The cruiser
has had her bottom scraped and the
work of painting her will begin to
morrow.

BOSTON, March 6. â Lieutenant-Com
mander William Hemsley Emory, U. S.
N., was interviewed at the Hotel Bruns
wick here to-day. At the present time
Lieutenant-Commander Emory is in
charge of the Bureau of Inspection and
Survey stationed in Washington, where
he holds consultations daily with Sec
retary of the Navy John D. Long. He
said: "I suppose you want me to talk
about the navy, and yet I do not know
whether there is really much to talk
about."
"Have you formed any opinion on the
Maine disaster?" was asked.
"Now that is something of which T
am as ignorant as yourself," answered
the lieutenant-commander. .
"Is it true that unusual activity is
manifested at the Navy Department in
Washington at the present time?"
"Yes, in a way. Such work as we
have had under consideration has been
pushed forward. Our boats are in read
iness and could be equipped in a very
short time if the occasion demanded.
Secretary Long, however, is the man to
whom the nation naturally looks for
information concerning the movements
of his department at this time. All his
movements are perfectly public."

MADRID, March 6.â A Cadiz corre
spondent writes that much interest is
taken in the coming voyage of the tor
pedo destroyers and torpedo boat
squadron. Its novelty and the manner
in which the boats will be rigged is
much debated on, and may be of in
terest to naval men. In the Rayo and
Azor alone has it been necessary to re
pair the machinery. On the torpedo
boats Terror, Furor and Plunton, a
temporary rigging is arranged for
three masts and for small sails to be
used if possible. The magazines have
been emptied of material so as to carry
coal, in order to augment the radius of
their action. The destroyers' artillery
on deck has been dismounted to make
them seaworthy. All these guns have
been placed in such positions that they
can be remounted at a moment's notice.
The trans-Atlantic steamer City at!
Cadi* will accompany the squadron.
She is filled with coal and provisions
literally up to her scuppers. She is
now fitted as a war transport, and has
on her deck four cannon of twelve
centimeters caliber, two of nine centi
meters, two mitrailleuses and two rapid
firing guns. In her bunkers she car
ries a large supply of coal solely for
the squadron. One hundred tons Is in
sacks for immediate use.
In order that the trip may not be
delayed more than is necessary, on the
decks of the trans-Atlantic steamer is
fixed a large sprint and two pipes,
which will serve to launch into the
water airtight cases, which will con
tain water, victuals and fresh bread.
In this manner all provisions will *c
distributed during the voyage.
It is estimated that the squadron will
travel at the rate of ten miles an hour,
a speed which cannot be exceeded, ow
ing to the fact that this trans-Atlantic
steamer will have to tow the Azor. the
smallest of all the torpedo boats, which
is not able alone to accomplish the
voyage. Forty days' time the trip will
take. The squadron will have to be re
coaled three times during the passage,
victualed each day, and the start de
pends upon the condition of the
weather.

SANGUINARY
ENCOUNTER
WITH SWORDS
Italian Deputy Slain
in a Duel at
Rome.
The Outcome of a Political
Wrangle Through
the Press.
Signor Felice Carlo Cavalotti,
Poet, Dramatist and Pub
licist, the Victim.
HIS JUGULAR IS SEVERED.
Senor Macola, tho Victor, Escapes
Without a Scratchâ Popular
Excitement
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ROME, March 6.â Signor Felice Carlo
Cavalotti, poet, dramatist, publicist and
the well-known Radical member of the
Chamber of Deputies for Corte-Olona,
was killed hero this afternoon in a duel
with swords with Signor Macula, mem
ber of the Chamber of Deputies and
editor of the Gazz^tta di Venezia.
The encounter was the outcome of a
pri'ss polemic in the columns of the Mi
lan Secola and the Clazzetta di Venezia.
It took place at an unfrequented spot
outside the Porta Maggiore. Senor
Macola's seconds were Deputies Signor
Guido Fusinato, a professor at the Uni
versity of Turin and member for Foltre,
and Signor Cavalotti's seconds were
Signor Bizzoni, the publicist, and Sig
nor Tassi, member of the Chamber of
Deputies.
Shortly before the meeting Sigrnor
Cavalutti seemed in excellent spirits,
and even joked with his seconds. When
the word was given he attacked his op
ponent vigorously.
The first two engagements were with
out result, but in the third Signor Cav
alotti received a thrust in the throat
that severed his jugular. At first it
was thought he was only slightly in
jured, but the gravity of the wound
was soon perceived on his putting his
hand to his mouth. He withdrew it,
covered with blood, and did not utter
a word.
The doctors and his seconds carried
him to Zellino, and laid him in a bed
at the residence of the Countess Cel
laro. There tracheotomy was per
formed and artificial breathing at
tempted, but all efforts were useless.
Signor Cavalotti explreti. in ten minutes
without speaking again. Signor Maco
la did not receive a scratch.
The news on reaching the city caused
a great sensation. Numerous Deputies
and friends hurried to the scene. There
is universal regret over the tragedy.
The late Signor Felice Manuel Cava
lotti. who was a member of a family
originally Venetian, was born in Mi
lan November 6, 1542. At the age" of
IS, having become noted for his poet
ry breathing hatred for Austria, he
threw himself with ardor as a writer
and soldier into the struggle for Ital
ian independence, taking part in vari
ous expeditions and publishing in the
newspapers of the day articles and
verses whose revolutionary audaeityat
tracted wide attention. He made his
debut as a dramatist writer at Milan
in 1871. presenting a grand historical
and patriotic drama entitled "L'Pez
zanti" (The Beggars), which was
hailed with loud acclaim as a new de
parture in romance. This was followed
by a series of dramas and comedies.
whose action was located at Milan.
Rome and Florence, and by several
plays based on ancient classic themes.
Signer Cavalotti published also a vol
ume of poems, for the most part polit
ical in theme, a collection of lyric
pieces under the title "Anticaglle," and
a translation of "Fragments do Tyr
tee." Some years ago he gathered his
various publications together and pub
lished them as "Oeuvres Completes" in
an elaborate edition.
Often elected' to the Italian Parlia
ment his career in the Chamber from
time to time was signalized by no less
agitation than the publication of his
poetic efforts. More than once his in
terpellations and his speeches invoked
parliamentary tempests. He was a life
long opponent of Signor Crispi, and was
glad to be known as one of the Italian
politicians who resisted with all their
energies the tide which, under the au
spices of Crispi, carried Italy toward
Germany.
In 1593, when the Banca Romanascan
dal was the sensation of Europe, Senor
Cavalotti, then the leader of the oppo
sition in the Italian Chambers, discov
ered what he called a new and most
promising lode. Going through the list
of great and little men entitled to wear
the Grand Cross of the Order of St.
Maurice and Lazare, he came upon the
name of Dr. Cornelius Herz. Rightly
conjecturing that it would not be there
except for a cash consideration, he
prosecuted his inquiries until he felt
warranted in making the public decla
ration that Signor Crispi, the Premier
of that day, was guilty of an illicit traf
ficking in decorations.
Not long after he published a pam
phlet against Crispi, repeating this
charge and adding the charge of brib
ery in the Fifth District of Rome,
where the Premier had defeated the
Sicilian Socialist Guiseppi de Felice
Giuffrida. He even gave notice in the
Chamber of a motion to annul the elec
tion. When the matter came up Crispi
flatly declined to make any statement
as to the quarrel and the Chamber sus
tained his action.
Signer Cavalotti then renewed the at
tack in his paper, the Sergio of Milan
and announced that he would prefer
charges in the courts. This threat he
carried out, and in his denunciation of
ADVEBTISEMENTS.

CHAUNCEY THE KID
TALKS POLITICS
Thinks the San Jose Bosses Have
a Hot Fight on Their
Hands,
SAN JOSE, March 6.â l'm Chauncey. Everybody knows Chauncey.
I'm Chauncey de Kid, wot does politics wid de bosses. Just now we ye
got a hot fight on our hands trying to do de purifiers. Say, de re maK
ing de pace, and it's a scorcher. Ye see, de're on to our plays, an dey
been callin' de turn on every trick. De truf is we dunno where were
at. Deya gone and put up a ticket dafs a corker and no mistake we
can't noways take a fall out of de men wot dey put up, so we re shoot
in' it inter Peckham and Charlie Koane.
Why, shure; we know Keane ain't a member of dat New cnarter
Club, but dat don't make no diff. De people wot reads de Mercury
ain't all on to dat lay, and I guess it fools a hull lot o' dem. Ye see,
dafs de way we dus. We knows dat many o1o 1 de guys wot votes don t
know who's who. so we just piles into anybody, and den make de read
era of our organ fink dot he belongs to do purifiers and is a high
muckamuck in der club. Pat's de way we're doin' wid IVckham Ye
see, Peckham'a all right, even ef he does want an office all de time Wot
are we after but de oflices ana de patronage? Don't ye notice we don t
say dat de bloke's crooked? You bet we ain't lookin' fur no libel suits;
our paper is sailing too close to do wind now.
My wasn't de boss hot w'en he saw how dey got onto Martin. Ye
know' IViurtin's our top-notcher. Dey can't touch his record, because
he's always been dead straight, but we reached him all right. Ye see,
we first swelled his nut by gettin' some o' his friends to go to Mm and
tell him wot a sure winner he would be if ho went into de fight for
Mayor. After we got him so that he had to increase de size of his hat
we Van Johnnie Mackenzie up agin him one day at de Del Monte. Den
w'en he came to San Jose, where he comes only to collect his rents,
which he spends somewhere else, he Swallowed de bait, and put out his
petition for Mayor. Dafs all we want. Of course we ain't claimln 1 him
now. Ye don't fink we're dat kind of a chump, do ye? Wait till he's
ole.-ted, den we'll get our work in. Ye don't see how? Well, you're a
nice sort o' duffer to ho tulkin' politics. Don't ye know dat we've been
flowing down de Uuckers and givin' everyfing in the furniture line
to the Lions for a long time? Don't ye know dat old man Ijion is a
brudilor-in-law of Martin, and dat w'enever we wants Martin all we

Kit: Ye don't ketch us holdin' any conwenshuns dis time. D'ye t'inks
we wan' to give our hand away to de people? Dey wud have our
ticket spotted an' dey wud'nt do a fing to it; oh, no. Dis way, makin'
dem all run as independents, we'll be able to work de con game on some
o' de voters anyway. It's a hard graft, dough, for de purifiers are
yellin' dat everybody dat ain't wid dem is fur de gang, and, say, de're
dead on.
Cert. Wo writ dat platform for Martin. Wasn't it a peacherine?
Andie Mackenzie tuk de copy up to de Mercury hisself.
Wot we're coin' to make de big fight on is de Mayor and de 'pointin'
board. Ye see. if we gets dese we've got de works, fur de board has
all de patronage dafs wuth anyfing. Dis board 'points five boards
o1o 1 five members each, and dese boards 'points all de firemen, police and
teachers and has charge of everyf ing connected with de Aium Rock
Park, where loads of money is goin' to be spent.
I haven't time to tell you about our udder candidates just now; may
be nex' time I sees ye. I got to go up to de Merc and see if I can't
brace dem up to jump onto some o' de candidates o' de purifiers. De

THE HAST FRAKCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 7, 1898.
VALIDITY OF
RIALTO BONDS
Case Affecting Owners
of Land in the
District.
Suit to Prevent the Sale of
Tracts for Irrigation
Taxes.
Judga Campbell of San Bernardino
Will Soon Render a â 
Decision.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN BERNARDINO, March 6.â
Judge Campbell, of the Superior Court
of this county, has just finished hear
ing arguments on a demurrer in the
case of M. V\ Butterfleld vs. Eugene
Weston, collector of the Rialto irriga
tion district. He has taken the case
under advisement, and on his decision
hangs in balance $427,000 worth of
bonds.
This contest is one where the plain
tiff, a resident of the Rialto irrigation
district, commenced suit to prevent the
collector of the district from selling his
land for unpaid assessments levied by
the board of directors of the district
with which to pay running expenses,
and also to pay interest on the $427,000
worth of bonds, issued when the dis
trict was first organized to raise money
to develop and pipe water from the
place of supply to the several uses of
it.
The plaintiff and others refused to
pay the assessment, claiming that the
bonds were illegal inasmuch as the dis
trict was unlawfully formed, had no
legal existence, and, therefore, could
not levy a legal tax. As the plaintiff's
assessment went delinquent, according
to the rules of the district his lands
were declared forfeited, and were ad
vertised to be sold.
The action forced the holders of bonds
into the fight as intervenor for the
safety of their investment, and they
took up the side of Collector Weston,
with Shirley C. Ward of Los Angeles as
attorney. The plaintiff is represented
by Otis, Gregg & Hall of this city, and
Henry Goodrich Jr. of San Francisco is
here assisting.
The present contest is on a demurrer
made by the plaintiff to the second
amended complaint of the intervenors,
which is really the keynote to the en
tire contest, for if sustained it sweeps
nut the whole issue of bonds, of a face
value of $427,000. Among the Interven
ors holding bonds are the San Fran
cisco Savings Union, German-American
Savings Bank, State Loan and Trust
Company, Los Angeles National Bank,
Blootnington Land Company, Anglo-
American Cannigre Company, Chicola
Water Company, and a large number
of private citizens all over the State.

GOING ALONG SMOOTHLY.
Other Craft From Alaska Ports Have
Heard Nothing of the Re

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, March 6.â The most dili
gent inquiries from officers on return
ing vessels fail to bring out anything
to corroborate the report of the
schooner Bessie X having gone ashore
or been wrecked in Alaskan waters.
Captain Roberts, master of the
steamer Farallon, which arrived from
Skaguay last night is positive that she
has met with no serious mishap. To
the Call correspondent he said this
afternoon: "On Thursday afternoon
last about 4 o'clock, at a point between
Fog Rocks and Bella Bella, about fifty
miles north of Queen Charlotte Sound,
we sighted a small schooner. We
passed within two miles of her, and
the noise she made satisfied me that
she was a gasoline schooner. Her
size, without sails, with topmast and
bowsprit, all indicated that she was the
Bessie K. Although I could not see
her name, yet I recognized and re
marked that she was the Bessie K.
She was going along smoothly, headed
for the north."
First Officer Wheeler of the Farallon
says he saw the Bessie X in San Fran
cisco about three months ago, and that
the gasoline schooner they sighted
Thursday afternoon was the same in
every particular. He further added
that he knows of no other steam
schooner now plying in Alaskan
waters. Neither Mr.. Wheeler nor Cap
tain Roberts had heard any report un
til they reached Seattle about the Bes
sie X having met with misfortune.
The steamer Navarro arrived in port
early this morning from Dyea, but
brought no tidings whatever of the
Besise K. The Navarro preceded the
Farallon for some distance coming
south. Both Captain Higgins and Pilot
Farrer think that they passed the
gasoline schooner between Fog Rocks
and Egg Island. .
Captain And-^rfton of the steamer
Lakme, which arrived late this after
noon from Skagi'--- stated to the Call
correspondent that he had heard noth
ing of the Bessie X having been
wrecked, nor did he see her on his way
down. He says that when at Skaguay
an officer of one of the steamers then
in that port, which he thinks was the
National City, told him that they had
seen the Bessie X on their way north.
According to him the schooner was in
Seymour Narrows, about n day's run
from Seattle She appeared to be
drifting with the tide, which was par
ticularly strong, but did not seem to be
in any great danger. Captain Ander
son thinks that if this was the Bessie
X she would likely put in some safe
harbor for a few days before continu
ing north.
The Bessie X left San Francisco for
Dyea on February 8, in command of
Captain Wilson.

land, with a sack containing $10,000. He
expected to return this month with a
friend or two. Instead he is going back
with 119 friends. Back in Missouri he was
plied with questions all winter. The Klon

ganize a party. He decided to do so in
December. _. ,
Yesterday the big party arrived on a
special train of fourteen . cars, two or
which were given up to the use of ninety
Missouri dogs. The Klondikers came
from Mexico. High Hill. St. Louis. Mober

St. Joseph. They paid $94 each for through
tickets from their homes to Juneau. Their
original intention was to outfit at Juneau,
but last night they took Tacoma outfit

to-day for their convenience, and to-night
their supplies to the value of $20,000 are
being carted to the wharves. The entire
party will board the steamship City 'of
Seattle at 9 o'clock to-morrow morning.
This party is the largest to start north
this season. It includes one minister, half
a dozen doctors, lawyers, farmers and
mechanics. Some of them will try the
Copper River country, while the majority
will follow Captain Purcell to Dawson.
He has claims on Bear and Hunker

Coursing at Los Angeles.
LOS ANGELES, March 6.â There was
a good crowd at Agricultural Park to
day, notwithstanding the cloudy skies.
It was a good chance for the manage
ment to demonstrate that it is the
coursing that draws the people, for
there was no extra inducement outside
of the customary races. There were
quite a number of ties run during the
day, and some of the favorites came out
only second best, being beaten by the
new dogs.
Flying Jib was sold at auction in the
afternoon, and will probably be run un
der a new name.
There were several San Francisco
people occupying boxes in the grand
stand to-day, who had attended the In
gleside races, and who seemed to think
that the two tracks compared very fa
vorably, and It is a fact that Agricul
tural Park is becoming one of the fln
cst sporting resorts In the Wept.
In the run offs. Blue Bird beat Bilk
Gem, Napoleon I beat Shamrock (for
merly Reddiek), Bailor Girl beat Wid

Practically AJI Opposition to the
Artillery Bill Disappears in
the House.
Sjveclal Disnatch to The Call.
Call office, Riggs House,
Washington, March 6.
The Senate will, in all probability,
begin the week with the consideration
of the bill making appropriation for
the District of Columbia, and when
this is completed will take up the con
ference report on the legislative, exec
utive and judiciul appropriation bill,
which has been agreed upon and will
be made to the Senate to-morrow. It
is considered quite probable that the
District bill will consume two or three
days or even more. One of the ques
tions in this bill which may arouse
debate is the action of the Senate Com
mittee on Appropriations in striking
out the item in the bill as it came from
the House limiting telephone charges
in the District. There will be an ef
fort to restore this proviso.
The census bill, the Methodist Book
Depository bill and Senator Pfttigrrw's
bill donating 5 per cent of the proceeds
of sales of public lands to the various
States in Which the lands are located
will contend for the right of way when
there are no appropriation bills to re
ceive attention, and it as yet uncertain
which item will be first taken up. All
of these may be antagonized by the
Hawaiian annexation treaty, but the
plans of the Foreign Relations Com
mittee with reference to the treaty are
so far too indefinite to permit any pre
diction as to what it will do.
It is probable that both the bill for
the relief of the survivors and the vic
tims of the Maine disaster and the Sen
ate bill creating two additional regi
ments of artillery with which to man
the coast defenses will pass the House
this week. The former bill was held
up until ft could be investigated, as it
was said that thÂ« special bill for the
relief of tht- survivors of the Samoan
wreck in ISXS led to some scandal. That
bill was luos'.ly drawn, and it has been
asserted some advantage of its provis
ions were taken. The present bill has
been carefully drawn and is now satis
factory to Mr. Cannon, chairman of
the Committee on Appropriations.
Practically all opposition to the artil
lery bill has now disappeared from the
House. The leaders were, it is said, in
favor of delaying action upon it to
allay public alarm, which might have
been intensified had it been rushed

into the Union. The mining fair re-
CALIFORNIA'S GOLDEN WEDDING.
Its Celebration Enthusiastically Favored by the
Mayor of Los Angeles.
LOS ANGELES, March s.â To the Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir:
I am most emphatically in favor of a semi-centennial exposition marking
the admission of California into the
sisterhood of States. Such an exposi
tion on the lines suggsted by The Call
would, in my opinion, do incalculable
pond. It would be a grand advertise
ment: it would show what we are do
ing; it would point out our possibilities
as nothing else could. What our State
needs most is some enterprise which
will show the people of the two conti
nents what we are doing, and this is
just what an exposition would do. No
one will say t.iat the Midwinter Fair
was not a grand success, nor that it
did not do wonders for the State. A
celebration in honor of the golden wed
ding of California should and would
exceed in magnificence and general
good to the State a Midwinter Fair.
We have the resources. No other State
has a richer or more varied field to draw upon. I know that every citizen of
the southern counties indorses my words when I say that we of the south
stand ready at all times to do everything in our power to a^d any proposition
which will operate for the good of the State of California. The fact that there
will be a World's Fair in Paris in 1900 should not cause us to falter. There
are hundreds of thousands of people who cannot afford the expense of seeing
Paris, but who can afford a trip to Californiaâ and they will come. Flower
shows and carnivals have done much to draw people at a distance to Los
Angeles, and we have been the gainer by their coming. Why should not active
interest be taken in a grand exposition in which every town, city and coun
ty of the State will take part? Such an exposition as proposed would prove
a benefit, not alone to California, but to all the Pacific Coast States. I can
not find a single argument against the proposition; everything is favorable.
We have the climatic conditions, we have the resources; we have men who
ne.'er fail when they take hold of an enterprise. Why then should we not go
ahÂ«ad? Let us put our shoulders to the wheel of progress; let us have a
semi-centennial exposition. Respectfully yours.
SAN JOSE WILL CO-OPERATE.
Every Dollar Expended for the Exposition Will Be
Repaid Many Times Over.
SAN JOSE, March 6.â The Call's suggestion that California celebrate the
semi-centennial of her admission as a State into the Union by holding a great
courage overcame all these obstacles
and laid here the solid fou-.dation for a great and glorious commonwealth.
Certainly these achievements and the grand strides since made are worthy of
commemoration. The great Golden State should holdan Interstateand Interna
tional Exposition that will portray to all the world her civilization, her re
sources and her progress. Nor would such an exposition cost her a dollar. On
the contrary, every dollar expended for such a purpose would be repaid over
and over again by the splendid advertisement which the State would receive
and the consequent greater demand in the markets of the East and of the
world for her products. This is an enterprise for the promotion of which all
the counties and cities in California can gladly combine, and I know that
Santa Clara County and the city of San Jose can be depended upon to co
operate with the other sections of the State in making the California Expo
sition of 1900 a magnificent success.
OUR STRIDES IN FIFTY YEARS.
We Should Give the World a Grand Demonstration
of Our Marvelous Progress.
NAPA March s.â ln an interview with Mayor J. A. Fuller of Napa, that
gentleman, referring to the Exposition, said:
"I heartily indorse the project as ad-
vorated by The Call of having an ex
position in 1900 in honor of the fiftieth
anniversary of the State of California.
On the 18th of October. 1850, I was pres
ent at the raising of the American flag
at Portsmouth Square, San Francisco,
in honor of California's admission to
the T'nion. California was admitted
nearly a month prior to that date, but
fifty years ago the telegraph and the
telephone were not giving the news of
the world to California as they are to
day. Let us give an exposition in 1900
and show to the world the advance
ment that this, the greatest of all
States, has made in half a century.
Fifty years ago California was almost
an uninhabited wilderness, while at
the present time no other country in
the world is making more rapid strides
In the way of advancement. I believe
In fittingly celebrating our State's fif-
tieth birthday and showing to the rest ,v. ;â  .
of the world what California Is; this State can have and should have an
exposition that will demonstrate that It is unsurpassed in productiveness
Exhibit the wealth of our mines; exhibit the productiveness of our soil and
exhibit the results of a most beautiful climate. Let us give an exposition
that will induce people from all parts of the world to visit our State, and
when they are here let us call to their attention the number and character
Df the charitable institutions maintained and owned by this State, thus show
ing that we are advancing both morally, socially and intellectually.

cently held in San Francisco to cele
brate the fiftieth year after the discov
ery of gold proved a great success and
of incalculable benefit to the whole
State, as it was a school for the old and
young and will be the cause for a closer
relationship between all of the people
now within the borders of the State. I
believe the move to hold an exposition
in 1900 similar to the "Mid-Winter Ex
position â¢' a most excellent plan and
just what should be done to bring
people of the United States and in fact
of all parts of the world to our State.
It would do more to advertise our re
sources than any other means possible,
and I for one would do all possible to
assist in such an undertaking.

exposition at San Francisco is one wor
thy of The Call's enterprise and of the
attention and interest of every resi
dent of the State. San Jose and Santa
Clara County I am sure can be de
pended upon to lend their moral and
financial support to the enterprise. No
State in the Union, no country in the
world, ever made such marvelous ad
vancement in so short a time from
such humble beginnings. Fifty years
ago California was in a state of semi
barbarism. It was comparatively an
unknown country, separated from the
East by thousands of miles of moun
tains, deserts and plains, haunts of
wild beasts and hostile Indians. Yet

THE SA3T FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 7, 1898.
\TTRACT THE NATIONS OF TMb EARTH
Let the Exposition Show California in All the
Glory of Her Matchless Charms.
MARYSVILLE, March 4.â Editor Call: A proposition with results be
yond the naming, and one that will prove an advertisement of inestimable
value to California, is that put forward
to carry on a celebration than those embodied in the proposed grand expo
sition, that will chII out the greatest number of people and attract the na
tions of the earth. It is none too soon to prepare for the grand event, which
will no doubt be on a magnificent scale. Let old and young take pride in the
Golden State and see to it that the divers resources of this grand common
wealth are afforded an apnortunity to do that credit which is peculiarly
the section's own. I have no doubt Northern California will enter into the
proposition with a vim. for no section of the State contains more truly loyal
patriotic sons and daughters than are found in the valley of the Sacramento.
Any scheme to advance the interests of th<* great and only California will
ever find able supporters in our midst, therefore we say in chorus, "Let the
good work go on." *. T. ELLIS. Mayor.
MANY EASTERNERS WOULD COME.
It Would Be a Big Thing for Every County in the
State, Says Fresno's Mayor.
FRESNO March 5.-C. J. Craycroft, president of the City Trustees and
ex-offlcio Mayor-I can only say that I am heartily in favor of the plan for
holding a semi-centennial exposition in
San Francisco to commemorate the fif
tieth anniversary of the admission of
California into the T'nion. The idea,
I believe, has originated with The Call,
and I can promise my hearty support
to the project. Of course every one
realizes that it is a stupendous under
taking, and one that would involve a
gTeat deal of hard work all over the
State to make it properly representative
of the State whose semi-centennial ad
mission it is proposed to so fittingly
celebrate. I have no doubt, however,
that if the project is taken hold of in
the proper spirit, as advocated by The
Call, it can be made a great success.
It would be a magnificent advertise
ment for the State and would attract
many Eastern visitors here, as the
Midwinter Fair did. It would give
Fresno County a splendid opportunity
which would attract the attention of all visitors to the exposition and would
doubtless result in bringing many new people to our favored part of the
State. Other counties would also have a similar chance, and it would be a
big thing for the whole State. Yes, lam for the exposition by all means.
SHOULD HAVE IT BY ALL MEANS.
The Exposition Idea Is Warmly Advocated by
San Diego's Mayor.
SAN DIEGO, March s.â As a citizen of California I am proud to
note the deep interest which The Call manifests in the upbuildingand growth
of this matchless State. Its ad-
cation of what California has done In
the last fifty years will surpass in magnitude all other attractions that
have ever been held upon the Pacific Coast.
Yes, let us have the exposition, ana let each and every citizen of the
Pacific Coast bend all his energies to make the same a success, and their fu
ture reward will be great. Respectfully, â 
D. C. REED, Mayor of the City of San Diego.
PRACTICAL AND PATRIOTIC IDEA.
Pomona Valley People Generally Favor the Califor
nia Exposition Proposition.
POMONA, March 2.->-Mayor Charles P. Patterson of Pomona was seen at
his pretty suburban home on Fifth street in this place to-day. He said:
"Of course I am in favor of the pro-
posed exposition in San Francisco In
1900 in commemoration of the first half
century of the State of California. It
is a good ideaâ eminently practical and
patriotic. I have just been reading in
The Call about the proposed exposi
tion. I believe that all California will
join enthusiastically in the plans. In
Pomona Valley the people will, I think,
generally favor the exposition propo
sition. I am confident.
"The exposition should be different
from the Midwinter Fair. That was
a sort of warmed-over side show of
the World's Fair, and was gotten up
too hurriedly to add much luster to- our
State. Now, the proposed exposition
may be planned and prepared for two
years in advance, and there need be no
incongruities about it. The California
exposition of 1900 ought to be mainly
representative of the great golden State, with a showing of the progress of
the Pacific Slope and all the region west of the Rockies in the last half cen
tury. There is material out here for making one of the most unique, in
teresting and Instructive exhibitions the world has ever seen. I would have
less exhibits of French silks and satins, German cutlery and terra cottas and
Italian mosaics and sculpture, and more California and Western products than
we saw at the Midwinter Fair. The benefits that the proposed exposition
would bring to this coast are incalculable. They would fill columns of The
Call. The first and general benefit, would be calling more attention to Cal
ifornia. Ours is a unique State. There is not another region on the globe
that has such a wide diversity of products and interests, and such extra
ordinary possibilities, that we ought to keep everlastingly at telling the world

by The Call, viz.: the holding of a
grand exposition in 1900 at San Fran
cisco to commemorate the semi-centen
nial of the admission of the State into
the Union. While the ninth day of
September, 1900, will be a day which
will justify a general jollification and
high jinks by the Native Sons, it will
remain for the populace to put their
shoulder to the wheel by inviting to
our midst the world, that it may learn
of the great strides the young State
has taken and become convinced that
the advancement is not a phantom,
but a real, steady progress, that in a
remarkably brief space of time will
place her in the galaxy of States the
grand particular star of all.
As some one has said, the Golden
Wedding of our State should be an
occasion for a demonstration that will
surpass all previous efforts; what bet
ter lines then can be advanced on which
vocacy of an exposition for 1900 is wise,
thoughtful and in keeping with the
progressive element for which California
has been famous throughout the civil
ized world.
San Francisco is particularly noted
for her hospitality in entertaining
strangers. Her resources for handling
large crowds are unlimited.
The exposition we should, by all
means, have. It will bring thousands
of people to our shores, who will come
for settlement, and thousands will be
attracted thither by advertisements of
our remarkable resources and great
ness.

OF COLONIES
Progress of the Conven
tion Being Held at
Melbourne.
Australian States Are Uniting
Under One Central Gov
ernment.
Delegates Still Have the Features of
the Enabling Bill Under
Discussion.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, March 6.â The Aus
tralian mail brought by the steamship
Aorangi contains very full reports of
the meetings at Melbourne of the Fed
eration Convention. The convention
opened on January 20, and when the
Aorangi left on February 6 no great
progress had been made.
When the convention got down to
business it took up the federation en
abling bill. A long discussion ensued
over the judiciary bill. It was decided
ultimately that as regards the high
court the bench should consist of at
least a chief justice and two other jus
tices. The right of appeal to the Im
perial Privy Council is abolished, except
in cases Involving public interest. A
proposal giving over all railways with
out consent of the States, instead of
railways that might be agreed to by
any State, was rejected. Another pro
posal to include a power to deal with
conciliation and arbitration for the pre
vention and settlement 'of industrial
disputes extending beyond the limits of
any one State was agreed to.
A question which had almost result
ed in a deadlock when the mail left
was a proposal to place the Murray,
Darling and Murrumbidgee rivers un
der Federal control.
The New South Wales delegates
raised the cry that the colony was be
ine robbed of its rivers.
At last the convemion unanimously
decided as a preliminary to remove
from the bill the sub-cause, giving the
federation the control and regulation
of the navigation of the iiurray ana
the use of its waters from where tfie
stream forms the boundary between
Victoria and New South Wales to the
sea.
Various compromises regarding other
rivers were being discussed when the
mail left.
The colony of Victoria, like Tasma
nia has suffered fearfully from bush
fires. Fires are reported from all parts
of the colony, and much damage has
been done. Scores of families are
homeless.
In Tasmania, Chief Justice Sir Lam
bert Dobson is obtaining a report of
the damage done by fire to guide the
relief committee in its distributions.
Nothing has ever been known before
i in the southern colonies like the ruin
wrought, and this year will long be
woefully memorable, both in Victoria
and Tasmania.
From Adelaide and Wellington. New
Zealand, come further reports of bush
fires. The report from New Zealand
says the fires did serious damage. The
township of Kaituna. near Fielding,
was all burned but one house.

CINCINNATI. March 6.â The Enquirer
to-day publishes the following: Many
persons have been speaking of Miss
Frances â¢Willard as the founder of the
National Women's Christian Temperance
Union. The founder of the Women's
Christian Temperance Union resides in
this city. Mrs. McClellan Brown was in
strumental in calling the first convention
inaugurating the movement at Columbus
in February. 1574. and in August following
she went to the Chatauqua assembly with
a full plan of organization, which *he
had Incorporated by a committee from
various States present at that assembly.
By her correspondence the first conven
tion was called at Cleveland in Novem
ber, 1874, where Miss Willard first en
tered upon the work and was made secre
tary of the convention. Mrs. Brown at
that time declined the nomination for the
presidency.
Mrs. Annie Wittenmeyer of Philadelphia
was president for five years preceding
Miss Willard's succession to the presi
dency in 1579. Mrs. Brown was, in 1574.
the "right worthy vice-templar of the
Good Templars, which had a constituency
of 800.000 paying members. Mrs. Brown
still holds the copyright of the original

SEATTLE, March 6.â The wrecked
steamer Corona has been hauled off the
rock upon which she struck on Janu
ary 23, in Arthur Channel, near Lewis
Island, Alaska. This information was
brought down by the steamship Lakme,
which arrived in port at 5 o'clock this
afternoon. Captain Anderson says that
when he was passing the wrecked
steamship on Thursday evening Cap
tain Harry Goodall asked for his assist
ance in floating the Corona. Tha
steamship had been pretty well pumped
out and at 8:30 o'clock on Thursday tha
Corona was again afloat. Through tha
aid of the Lakme and the steam
schooner Maude she was hauled into
shoal water.
Her pumps having been stopped for
several hours the vessel again began to
fill up. It was expected that In a day
or two the steamship would be raised
and placed on the sand beach. After
plugging up the holes she would then
be ready to be brought south and
placed on the dry dock for permanent
repairs.
The steamship Lakme had a pleasant

MORE RECORD-BREAKING.
rREQUEXT reference has been made of late to
the continued breaking of all previous business
records, but the latest commercial advices from
all over the country indicate that we are about to
eclipse even the recent prosperity in the near future.
Almost all signs point to a heavier trade than we
have done yet. The gain in the bank clearings,
which has been increasing week after week, ran up
to 68.9 per cent last week, and only one city of any
importanceâ Toledoâ showed a loss. The increase in
New York was enormous, being 71 per cent, and this
in the face of a lower and quieter stock market on ac
count of the reported purchase of warships by Spain.
Had this unfavorable factor not been developed the
gain would have been even larger. The increase, then,
is plainly due to the heavier movement of merchan
dise, which is far better than activity in speculative
shares, as it shows more abundant purchasing on the
part of the country at large.
This view of the case is substantiated by reports
from the different sections of the country. In the
Central West all kinds of goods are more active than
ever before known at this time of the year, dry goods,
groceries, boots and shoes, hardware, lumber and
farming tools being especially mentioned. The South
reports continued strength in cotton and an increased
export movement in corn. The East reports higher
prices and an active trade in iron, provisions and sev
eral of the minor metals. The woolen trade alone
shows a falling off, and even this is not particularly
marked. The usual decrease in failures is shown,
those last week being 232. against 262 for the same
week in 1897. A growing demand for manufactured
products is not the least indication of the steady in
crease in trade.
It may safely be said that the United States is now
enjoying about the best commercial times in its his
tory. Talk of hard times has wholly ceased. Never
has the movement of merchandise been so heavy,
never have the prospects been brighter. The pur
chasing power of the country has expanded enor
mously during the past year. Both city and
country share the general prosperity. It is a ques
tion who is doing the best, the farmer or the mer
chant. Ordinarily it is not difficult to tell. We are
feeding the world and the world is passing over its
gold into our coffers in a steady stream. War talk
has no effect on business, crop prospects are good al
most everywhere, and the whole country has appar
ently been turned into a commercial beehive. Under
v .he Republican administration we are making up what
ive lost under years of Democratic free trade, and it
Is to be hoped that the lesson contained in the present
prosperity will not be lost on the American people
A-hen they are again called upon to choose between
:he two.
The local situation continues encouraging. The
â¢ecent rains have not been followed by the usual north
winds, and as the weather has been warm the grow
ing crops have made marked headway except in one
or two interior districts, where they still need copious
rains to pull them through. The northern part of the
State and the coast counties never looked better than
they do to-day. The long-continued cold weather in
February kept back the fruit buds, thus giving them
more immunity from the usual spring frosts, aud the
crchardists are already looking forward to a good
crop of fruit. Merchants report an active de
mand for goods for all points dependent on San
Francisco, and in some lines, notably provisions,
;rade is phenomenally brisk.
Prices for California products seem pretty well es
tablished, for fluctuations are few. Wheat r til I hangs
about $i 42^2, where it has been so long, but barley
is rising slowly under the lack of rain in some of the
important districts. The grain markets have been
dull for a fortnight, as the tax assessment will be
made out on the basis of to-day's holdings, and as no
body wants to own any more property on the first
Monday in March than necessary, buying has ac
cordingly been slack of late. It is expected, however,
that trade will pick up after this important day is
passed.
Los Angeles objects to having colts killed and ex
posed for sale as veal. The mere stopping of the
practice will be insufficient. The only place for a
man who would engage in it is the penitentiary. A
person capable of selling colt for calf would sell cat
for rabbit.
Explanations as to the killing of a Georgia post
master are not yet adequate. Neither the fact that he
was a Republican, a negro or that somebody else
wanted the job seems sufficient to eliminate the ne
cessity for a hangman.
Senator Proctor seems to be having no end of fun
in Cuba. He has seen a bullfight, a battle and been
in the vicinity of a blown up train. To a quiet gen
tleman with a Vermont education all this ought to
appear impressive.
Weyler is lending color to the suspicions against
him by denying that they have any foundation.
JEFFERSONIAN DEMOCRACY.
A MEETING at Philadelphia of the representa
tives of the Pennsylvania organization calling
itself "The Jeffersonian Democracy" has ac
quired something more than local notoriety by the
fact that during the proceedings a letter was read
from ex-President Cleveland. The former idol of the
mugwumps is not much of a figure in the politics of
to-day, but he is so much bigger than the Jeffersonian
Democracy that the report of what he wrote to be
read at the meeting is more interesting than all the
rest of the proceedings put together.
The letter does not directly commend the Jeffer
sonians, and can hardly have been wholly pleasing
to them. It approves their cause strongly enough,
but carefully avoids approving of them or of their or
ganization. "I hope most sincerely," says Mr. Cleve
land, "that there may be a sound money movement
in Pennsylvania that will be strong and useful." In
this utterance there was nothing to rouse the ardor
of the meeting, for all the world knows the Jeffer
sonian Democracy can never start a movement which
will be strong or useful, and that its only means of
aiding a sound money campaign would be that of dis
banding and sending its members into the rank and
file of the Republican party.
The only portion of Mr. Cleveland's letter that is
of any importance is that in which he urges increased
activity on the part of the sound money men in com
bating the aggressive free silver forces. He very
justly says: "If any one believing with us supposes
that free silver can be prevented from controlling the
two houses of the next Congress without effective or
ganization and hard work the quicker he abandons
the idea the more useful he will be as a sound money
man."
The warning of these words is pertinent to citizens
of all classes, but they are especially so to the Jeffer
sonians. There must be unity in the camp of the
friends of honest money and national honor, or the
free silver craze will survive the Congressional elec
tions this fall and harass the country for two years
to come. The Jeffersonians can hardly mistake the
meaning of the warning. They must drop their silly
play at organizing a party of their own and com
bine with the great host of sound money men in the
Republican party. Only by doing so can they become
useful to the cause and an important factor in the
great struggle that is approaching.
In concluding his letter Mr. Cleveland said: "I
am so earnest in my desire to see our country blessed
with safe money and a suitable financial system that I
am of the opinion that we ought to give patriotic and
consistent support to any plan which insures this re
sult and which has the element that promises its suc
cessful advocacy." If the Jeffersonians have any
sense at all they will know what that means.
The only plan that assures sound money in this coun
try is the unity of all sound money advocates in the
ranks of the Republican party. The Jeffersonians
who insist on a party of their own are crazier than
the Bryanites, just as the old donkey grown blind to
the signs of the times and deaf to words of warning is
stupider than the young ass braying in his wildness.
THE ARTILLERY BILL.
IT is gratifying to learn by dispatches from Wash
ington that Chairman Hull of the Committee on
Military Affairs is sanguine the bill providing for
two additional regiments of artillery will be passed by
the House during the coming week. The measure
is of special importance owing to the crisis of the
time, but even if there were no sign ot possible war
upon the horizon it should be promptly enacted be
cause the increase in the strength of the artillery serv
ice is needed to render efficient the work already
done in the way of coast defenses.
We have not a sufficient number of men in the ar
tillery of the army to adequately handle the guns
already placed in positions of defense along our
coasts, and the number of such guns is soon to be
largely increased. According to a recent report made
by Senator Hawley, existing contracts call for the
emplacement and mounting, on or before June 30 of
this year, of 139 modern high-power steel guns, rang
ing in caliber from eight to twelve inches, twelve of
5-inch caliber, four six-pounders and 232 12-inch
mortars, a total of 387.
It is easy to see that the expenditure for these guns
will be virtually wasted money unless men are pro
vided to take charge of them in time of peace and use
them in time of war. We cannot wisely rely upon
volunteers for such service, for while volunteers
might and probably would be plentiful, they would
not have the training required to enable them to per
form the task. The handling of coast defense guns
requires carefully selected and thoroughly drilled
men, and these can be obtained only by means of the
bill now before Congress.
When the measure was before the Senate it was
opposed only by a few Bourbon Democrats whose
numbers were too small for them to be regarded as
representatives of their party. The opposition in the
House is of the same futile and unworthy character.
Fnough opposition, headed by Sulzer of New York,
was manifested when the bill was first brought into
the House to procure its postponement, but it can
not delay, much less defeat, the measure when it
comes up for final action. The passage of the bill is
regarded as well assured, and in the present crisis it
is gratifying to know that this step in the direction
of national defense is not a party measure, but is to
be taken by the well-nigh unanimous consent of men
of all parties and from all sections of the Union.
BARRING THE WAY TO TRADE.
IF the story of San Francisco should ever be pre
sented in the form of a drama there would be no
difficulty in determining what power should play
the part of her antagonist and take the role of vil
lain. The Southern Pacific Company has by all its
actions attested its claim to that place, and some of
these actions have been so conspicuously adverse to
the welfare of the city that none would question the
right of the monopoly to assume the part and bear the
title.
At the present time, when merchants, manufac
turers, citizens of all classes and of nearly all degrees
of wealth are striving to advance the community and
place San Francisco in a position where she and her
people can reap a due share of the profits of the re
vival of industry and the rapidly growing Alaska
trade, behold the Southern Pacific Company comes in
again to mock at this public spirit and by it mon
opoly of transcontinental travel baffle the efforts at
enterprise and progress.
All our rival cities are to have the benefits of
cheaper rates from the Eastern centers of population.
What has been done by the citizens to procure the
advantages of the Alaskan trade is counterbalanced
by what the railroad is doing to prevent the trade
from coming here. The road has decided that the
Alaskan trade is to be taxed as much as it will bear,
and if that traffic escapes by going to northern ports
to outfit, then the monopoly will recoup itself by the
old form of exacting every cent possible from the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 7, 1898.
people of the State who must of necessity use that
line by reason of the lack of any competing trans
portation system across the continent.
The attitude taken by the monopoly toward the
Alaskan trade is the more exasperating because so
much depends upon winning that trade at this sea
son in order to profit by the large development of it
that is to be expected in years to come. San Fran
cisco has put an unwonted energy into the task of
gaining this trade and making it a permanent addi
tion to the commerce of the city, and it is irritating
to find a railroad dependent upon the city for sup
port turning against it at this juncture and refusing
to grant it equal transportation facilities with those of
other Pacific ports.
Fortunately the commercial advantages of San
Francisco with relation to Alaska are too many and
too strong to be overturned even by the giant mon
opoly that is working against them. Alaskan outfits
can be obtained here in larger quantities and varieties
and cheaper than anywhere else, and the shipping of
this port is so far superior to that of any other city
on the Pacific Coast that comparison would be fool
ish. By reason of these advantages and the exercise
of untiring energy and skillful co-operation we may
hold the trade despite the Southern Pacific and its
managers. San Francisco is too vigorous a com
mercial factor to be destroyed by a monopoly, no
matter how powerful it may be.

ventional, admit that the Salvation Army has done
much for the advancement of morals. They have a
similar feeling for the American Volunteers, a branch
of the parent organization. These bodies have won
a way to popular esteem by energetic and unselfish
efforts to uplift fallen humanity. They reach many
whom the church is unable to touch. They boldly
invade the haunts of crime. To poverty they extend
the hand of fellowship, visiting the sick, feeding the
hungry, until in contemplation of their good work
the din of their blare and the noise of their shout

helpful bands has sprung a great evil.
Every worthy cause is espoused by some unworthy.
About every noble standard flock a share of pretenders.
The greedy and the vile, the lazy and the unclean
have observed that the public supports a cause de
signed for the promotion of the weal of the lowly,

such a cause. The results are deplorable. Bogus
"armies" spring up like mushrooms and fatten on the
ciedulity of human nature. Creatures more vile than
any openly sinful ask alms which they use themselves.
It is easier to beg for a living than to work. Where
these creatures dwell together in intimate association
crime is surely engendered.
It is a shocking thing to see a wretch so degraded
that the observer turns from him with loathing pose
as the head of "the Army of Jesus Christ." What
could be more disgusting than the spectacle of an
abandoned and shameless female, dead to every de

ness, and yet claiming to be the head of "God's Regu
lar Army"? The local columns tell the story as well
as it may be told. If the police cannot unaided reach
such noisome birds of prey it is the duty of the fol
lowers of the Booth flag to come to their assistance.
If they shall not do so the feeling of distrust created
by exposure will extend to those %v!io do not deserve

WHAT BECOMES OF METALS?
The greater portion of the lead mined is converted
into white lead, red lead and orange materials which
are used as pigments for paints. Much lead is man
ufactured into sheet, some into bullets and other
projectiles, and the only lead which comes back into
the market in the form of scrap is that used for
lead pipes.
Zinc is largely used in galvanizing steel or iron,
in manufacturing brass, as a sheet zinc, and as ox
ide of zinc used in paint. The only zinc available
for the new use is that used in making brass. Next
to scrap iron and steel, scrap brass is found on the
market.
Most of the world's tin product is used In tin
plates. The scrap is not available, and, though
many efforts have been made to utilize tin scrap, no
considerable amount of metal has been obtained this
way.
Next to iron and steel, copper is most used in me
tallic form, only a small proportion being used in the
salts of copper and blue vitriol. The great uses of
copper are in the manufacturing of brass, of which It
forms two-thirds, in electrical conductors, sheet
roofing, cooking utensils and pipes.
Just what becomes of the enormous amount of
metal mined every year is a mystery, as a very
small proportion* is returned in the form of scrap
material.

EVIL OUT OF GOOD.
POINTED PARAGRAPHS.
IRONICAL IFS.
INDIVIDUAL THOUGHTS.
BY A MODEST CRITIC.
This is scarcely a place to advertise
! magazines, but having spoken irrever
ently once of its editor I ask permis
sion to advise students of tutelage, of
leprosy and of philology to buy the
! current issue of the Cosmopolitan.
j Those philologically inclined will be
amused; the others instructed.
Dr. Jordan of Stanford has had pre
sented to him by the editor of this
magazine a series of somewhat loose
jointed questions all bearing on what
the editor deems education to be. Dr.
Jordan's replies show how well fitted
for the position he holds he is. This
scholar is a sensible trainer and devel
oper of humankind. This Is shown in
the two last queries and the replies
which follow:
"7. Do you hold that time should be
obtained for the most Important studies
by omitting those which are least im
portant.
"Answer of President Jordanâ l hold
that each student should be educated
for himself in his best way and that
any curriculum not involved in the na
ture of the subject is a hindrance and
an impertinence.
"8. Should not all students be com
pelled to include, as part of their daily
duties, exercise sufficient to develop
sound bodies while establishing habits
tending to maintain health at a maxi
mum of efficiency?
"Answer of President Jordanâ A stu
dent should be led to seek such train
ing, but education is largely a train
ing of the will. He should seek it for
himself, not be obliged to take It."
Had the interpellator shown a tithe
of the sense of the replier I should be
inclined to, as a lover of sensible gen
eral cultivation, beg the reproduction
of the article in its entirety. It is worth
reading as it is.
As to the leprosy: A. woman, I judge,
whose individuality from necessity is
latent, has a quite interesting article
on the subject, and one that shows an
ability to observe. The history of what
the Hawaiian Government has done in
its vain attempts to control or extirpate
the plague is fairly told. Credit is gen
erously given where due, but the whole
picture is as repulsive a one as can
well be painted â yet this writer has
done it innocently enough. The com
mand of language shown is not great,
yet the horrors pointed to could not be
faithfully described by a Zola, if for
publication. Here are one of two ex
cerpts: "Some (lepers) have been dis
covered when their limbs were gone
and only a bloated head and trunk re
mained. Such a case as this is at pres
ent only a short distance from me. But
in the face of this misery nothing can
be done to arouse fear of contagion
among the natives. They will smoke
the pipe of a leper, eat poi from hia
calabash, sleep in his bed and wear his
clothes. They become neither dis
gusted with his distorted and swollen
features nor afraid of becoming in
fected with the disease."
After speaking of the well-known ex
ceeding immorality of the people, and of
frightful cruelty to a poor leprous child
of six the writer says: "A half-caste
woman here was married to three for
eigners each of whom went to Molokai.
After each case she was examined for
signs of the disease, but none appearing
she went free until suddenly it ap
peared in its most malignant form and
she soon died." Will Senator Davis
read this story and believe it? Will Sen
ator Morgan be good enough to see
what is told in a way that carries with
it the inherence of truth? The arti
cle is written in a style so clearly inge
nuous that it is plain its author has
seen much of the hideousness of lep
rosy, which Senator Morgan has not.
Hut having read this pitiful tale will
either of those gentlemen seek to make
the Hawaiian Islands a county of Cali
fornia? Western hospitality is as noted
as is that of the South, but if the day
has come when, because of generosity
we are to be asked by Congress to at
tach to this State a colony of which
five per cent are lepers, the time has
come for acting with sense as well as
with big hearts. It is useless to urge
that we shall allow no lepers to come
here. As the Cosmopolitan's corre
spondent truly says, "All do not appear
to be lepers who are so." The West has
ever shown devotion to national inter
ests, and proposes to continue so to do,
but justice should be meted out to us.
California wants no lepers and she
should not be forced to accept them.
Those members of a State Legislature
who will vote to annex these rotting
people have no right whatever to repre
sent a healthy and clean populace. The
Examiner's support of this vicious
scheme is another instance of its be
trayal of a public that it pretends to
serve.
The philologists will find their diver
sion in the suggestion of Mr. John Bris
ben Walker that an international lan
guage shall be created by their help.
He wishes probably an improved Vola
puk. Of course, no language consid
erer of ability will give the scheme a
moment's thought. The words uttered
in Anglo-Saxon do not convey the same
meaning to those not of Anglo-Saxon
descent. No education can transform
either bodies or minds. The proposal
to make an international language is
equivalent to the suggestion that a
brotherhood of mankind is possible.
That is not in view just now, though
I have heard that it has been arranged
for in heaven. We are not there yet.
The "Hasta Manana" of the Spaniard
means to him "Hasta Manana" alone.
It neither means the "Au revoir" of the
Frenchman nor the "Good-by; see you
again" of the Anglo-Saxon. It never
will till we can turn a Spaniard Into a
Frenchman at order. Mr. Walker
should essay that task before attempt
ing to induce nations to take part in a
revised Volapuk. Weyler would be a
good subject to start on, but I am
afraid he will find that gentleman more
of a confirmed Castilian than he is
aware of.
In the matter of impertinence the Ex
aminer has at length managed to sur-
Pumh Itselfâ which is saying much. On
Wednesday last it published some pic
tures of what it called its "War corre
spondents," one of whom was said to
be Jimmy Creelman. On its first page,
however, this piece of mendacity was
somewhat upset by an article said to
have emanated from Creelman in Lon
don. Possibly the Examiner-Journal
outfit has declai-ed war against Great
Britain while Congress talked peaceful
appropriations. But what a precious
lot of beauties these so-called "War
correspondents" were! Alfred Henry
Lewis (of whom more anon) who saw
in Mr. Sixteen to One Bryan a eavior
of the -world; one whose endurance,
whose sense and whose virtues were
matchless; Karl Decker who knows
that the commander of the Maine is to
overrule the proceedings of the board
of inquiry that is virtually sitting in
judgment on him; Julian Hawthorne,
who "sees nothing even when he is
paid to observe," but is an aspiring
dunce, and the hero of Port Arthur
humbuggery already referred to. Some
attempt was made at respectability by
putting in an artist who is well known,
but that act gives the sketcher a clean
right to sue for damages.
But to revert to the Lewis person for
a moment. He has drifted from his
vocation. He wrote a few passable
short stories â Arizonan life imagined
being his only field â and he was on the
road to the particular kind of success
which such work makes possible when
he was inflicted by a yellow journal.
From Key West he has recently seen
fit to insult the navy, which is not per
missible. The slanderer says: "Speak
ing of naval uniforms, I do not like the
mush-and-milk twaddle of some of the
young sprigs who wear it. The older
officers are bloody-minded enough, and
in a quiet decorous way are ardent
enough to slay the Spaniard in his lair
and avenge the Maine. But I have cut
the trails of certain of our newly
hatched officers, who seem to be inocu
lated with lamb's blood, and are de
cidedly voluble in bleating for peace."
When, liar that you are, did you ever
find a respected officer of the navy
who lusted for the blood of a fellow
mortal? When did you hear a single
cadet speak as a craven or as a cow
ard? The truth is that officers of the
navy have been instructed not to talk
of affairs in Cuba. Seeing that they
obey their orders to your discomfort
you asperse their characters. Go back
to your dreamings of barroom events
where bravado means courage, where
cleanliness is despised, where the chief
aim in life is to get drunk and where
no high purpose finds creation.
I am heartily glad that Mr. Long is
sued the orders of reticence, for you
and your fellows are ever ready to fas
te.Â» in the mouths of honorable men ut
terances that they disdain to think of.
Here is your own evidence of fraud for
your own convict: ,n. You say in this
same dispatch "The fleet here * * *
at 3 o'clock this afternoon received
orders to hold themselves ready to
start at the tap of the drum for Ha
vana. The orders came from Secretary
Long to Admiral Sicard and are said,
etc." No such orders are ever issued,
nor could they be. A lack of confidence
would be immediately shown, and that
is infectious. This follower of Ana
nias may learn that confidence is one
thing that is bredâ is purposely bred
in men who may have to fl^ht. It is one
of the chief aims of discipline, and is
never lost sight of. A war ship in com
mission is always ready to start at
command, and to-day Admiral Sicard
is probably as unconcerned as to where
his ships may be ordered as to what
lit' will have for disner. What he is
told to do he will do â he needs no "Get
ready," and no one knows this better
than Mr. Lone. Those of infantile
minds are not chosen for Cabinet posi
tions.
The navy could easily stamp out the
evil in this youngster if it were worth
the trouble, by declining to speak to
any representative of any paper that
employed the Lewis. This is too
much trouble to take, but it would
effect a ver- orompt reformation in
this slanderer.
I know the general character of the
officers of our navy far better than
any Lewis can do. These men â many
of them â have been my companions,
my associates, my friends for years
and years in varying circumstances,
and (to continue in Mr. Conkling's
vein) a more courageous, upright, hon
orable, generous, square true class of
men never walked the face of God's
earth nor sailed his seas. Through
with you, Alfred Henry Lewis, but if
the members of Congress who have
gone to Cuba as hirelings of the paper
for which you at present tell un
truths, dare slur or impugn the hon
esty of the intelligent Naval Board of
Inquiry now in consultation, prompt
and cheerful attention shall be paid
them. To further wound the national
heart ruthlessly by those negligent of
duty will not be permitted.
The editor of a well-known marine
paper â one who is intelligently inter
ested in sea-coaling â draws attention
to the fact that Germany has added
another steamship of high order, cap
able of being fitted as a commerce de
stroyer as well as having a carrying
capacity of 20,000 tons, to its already
large fleet. "What," my correspondent
asks, "would Captain Mahan think of
a base like three ships of the 'Pretoria'
type? Sixty thousands tons of supplies
(coal being the principal item) in three
armed but unarmored vessels would be
a very valuable base indeed, and as
pointed out by my correspondent it
could be kept on the move at all times.
True, the base might be captured, but
so may any other base. Unless I am
much mistaken, Captain Mahan will
soon discard his printed ideas about
the strategical value to the Pacific
Coast of the Sandwich group. To do
himself credit, he should do it openly.
To publicly admit error is not to fall
in the estimation of those whose opin
ions are at all valuable."

The usual devices of the attorneys having â

Over 2000 people gathered at the
Union Coursing Park yesterday to wit
noss ms clever sport in the coursing
line as has been placed before the pub
lic for many days. The hounds were in
Bplendid condition, but the hares
seemed to be slow and rather out of
condition, but this little drawback was
overcome by the enthusiasm of the
cri wd and the amount of money that
1 into the pool boxes during the
en lire day.
The talent was a sorry lot from
morning' until night, as short enders
bad the day by themselves. In the sec
iurse Lissak outran Arapahoe at
- ana Van Cloie, owned by Q.
Hummel, followed with a clever
win at odds which were not warranted
g to the condition of the
is. The feature of the day, how
was the special purse of $100,
which had been hung up by the asso
ciation for a two out of three course
slipped for Master Jack and O'GraJy.
The hounds had created a slight dis
sension at the last Sunday's meeting
and it waa decided to give the owners
of the hounds a chance to see what the
runners were worth. In the first go
O'Grady sold favorite, but was easily
beaten. When they started again Mas
ter Jack was beaten at even money,
but in the final Master Jack walked off
with the money and was heartily
cheered as he came from the field.
This win overrules the decision given
by Judge Bull at the last meeting of
the two clever youngsters.
Ther^ is still much talk, concerning
the work done by Slipper Taylor, and
the majority of the people agree that
the work is not satisfactory, but at the
same time they admit that it is not
altogether the fault of the slipper, but
is partially due to the slips, which are
reported to be not up to date, as the
hound on the white seems to walk off
with the best of it.
There was but one kick against the
imported judge, E. J. Bull, but that one
was loud and long. In the third ties
of the open stake Lissak and Nelly B
left the slips, and after a hard fought
omrse the fleet-footed hound entered
by A. Johnson was given the decision.
It was at this point, and this one only,
that the complaints were made, but
many were on the Held who were will
ing to place all kinds of money up that
the decision had been a just one, and
there the matter stood when the day
wus declared over.
The short end players went home
jubilant, as the game little Susie beat
the wonder Kosette in the final. It is
rather a matter of wonder how Susie,
who almost invariably is the runner,
should be placed on the short end, but
euch Is the fact, and many times the
money travels in her direction.
â  Next Sunday an open stake, with
â¢entrance money placed at $2 50 and $5
added, will be run down. The drawing
will take place at Pythian Castle next
Wednesday evening.

The betting ring at Ingleside Cours
ing Park presented a lively scene yes
terday. The gold poured into the
coffers of the "bookies." The talent
received several shocks, but each new
phase of the game only served to make
the day's sport the more enjoyable,
and In the evening when the last course
had been run matters stood even
enough to bring cheerfulness to all.
Prominent in the crowd that hovered
around the pool boxes were Dr. Con
lon, William Brennan, Jack Gallagher,
Edward Goldstone, Moses Altmeyer
and a contingent from the Olympic
Club, headed by Hugo Belau, that was
largely instrumental in fluctuating the
odds when the dogs were ready for the
race.
The puppy race that headed the day's
programme proved fortunate for the
talent until the fourth course, when
Dempsey Lass lowered the colors of a
3 to 1 favorite, Hush o' the Hill. The
race of the trim built hounds for su
premacy was a brilliant one, but the
cleverness of the short -end dog won the
money. This little setback for the tal
ent resulted in a strengthening of the
nerves of the betters which was not to
be deplored, as following evertc proved
even more disastrous to the money.
Mystic Maid.a late Eastern importation,
in the lirst course of the all-a b e stake,
sailed forth from the slips and put out
in clever style the crack of the coast,
Moondyne, a 4 to 1 favorite. In the
next course Gladiator, a 3 to 1 favorite
and belonging to the same stable, was
beaten by Old Glory and the money be
gan to creep in. Sly Boy was the next
favorite to fall. He was pitted agatnst
Senorita and odds of o to 2 were offered
on him. When the course was run he
was out of the purse, but his conqueror
only lasted one course longer when
White Lily lowered her colors in the
second ties. The California brindle
Swinnerton came out victor in the next
go by downing the Eastern flyer Crow
L)og who sold at 2 to 1. Patria, who
knocked out Fireball in the fourth
start proved one of the sensations of
the day. Patria was lately imported
from the East and began to show her
speed but recently. Her condition-was
such yesterday that the book makers
took her cause in hand and began ot
make the money flow on that run.
About even money was offered on the
fleet animal by the book makers at the
opening, but at the close as high as 4
to 1 was offered. The pick of the talent
proved correct, and at the end of the
day's coursing Patria was the victor
over all and carried away the stake for
the dogs of all ages. In anticipation
of the day's events that came to pass
several prominent book makers were in
evidence and their Judgment was
favorably commented on by the talent,
which cashed all in all much more than
usual.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 7, 1898.
MRS. STEVENSON'S DEPARTURE.
Her Gifted Husband Was Formulating a New
Book When He Died,
In common with most of us. Mrs. Robert Louis Stevenson has haa
a touch of la grippe lately, and has had to postpone her departure for
the East for several days in consequence. But, sick or well, she leaves
us to-day, though she hardly seems fit to stand the fatigue of a long
overland journey.
Curled up on a sofa in her warm sitting room at the Occidental,
Mrs. Stevenson chats away pleasantly about her intended movements.
She wears her invariable indoor dress, the long, shapeless holokui, the
Hawaiian costume which has been adopted by natives all over the Pa
cific as a Sunday dress. Long residence in the islands has accustomed
Mrs. Stevenson to this style of attire; her peculiar charm of manner
would be quite lost in the orthodox garb of the Caucasian dressmak
er. The loosely hanging robe is as much part of her persona ity aa the
cigarette, which she is always rolling and smoking. Few ladies can
smoke with grace, but Mrs. Stevenson is one of the few.
"The winter, even in this mild climate, has tried me very much,"
she remarked, "but now the spring is approaching I must get on to Lon
don. Sydney Colvin, my late husband's literary friend and adviser, is
waiting for me there, and there is still a lot of work to do on the biog
raphy. It Is a big task, for there is an immense amount of material to
sort out and condense.
"No; the book is not to form part of the uniform Edinboro edition
of Mr. Stevenson's works. The volume, or perhaps there will be two,
is to be issued quite independently, but I cannot yet say who will bÂ«
the publishers. The preparation of the work is in pood hands. You see,
Sydney Colvin has known my husband since he was a boy and was
of the greatest help to him throughout the whole of his literary ca
reer. Colvin has all the materials at hand, but there are many points
on which he wishes to consult me, and so I must spend some time in
London, all the summer. I expect."
"And then?" â¢
"Then I must winter in some summer clime, Egypt, probably. I
dare not risk a winter in London."
"Why not return to Samoa?"
"Some day I may, but only as a visitor, not as a permanent resident.
Vailima is still in the market; we have had many inquiries, but no defi
nite offer. A wealthy Englishman will probably buy it, as a novel kind
of winter residence. And, really, the world is so small nowadays, that
there is no reason why a man should not spend his summers in London
and his winters in Samoa."
It is quite true, Samoa is nearer to London to-day than Scotland
was a century ago, and there is no reason why some one with plenty
of money to spend should not revive the sentimental associations
which cling round the island home which Stevenson made for himself,
and where, like his ancestral Hiehland Chiefs, he ruled his little clan
of Samoans, beloved by all. receiving service rather as a token of
gratitude than as an equivalent for wages paid.
"I wouldn't mind this traveling and moving about at all." contin
ued Mrs. Stevenson, "were it not for the difficulty of disposing of one's
things. I have so many valuable articles which I cannot leave lying
around, and yet I must keep them until they can be disposed of. There
is the best portion of the Vailima library, including many rare works
which Mr. Stevenson picked up from time to time. Then there is," and
she lowered her voice to a respectful tone while speaking of the great
treasure, "an original Hogarth, his 'Midnight Modern Conversation.'
People would not believe I had this painting, but it is here safely
stored in a fireproof room. I showed it to a connoisseur the other day,
and he was amazed. Of course," added Mrs. Stevenson, regretfully,
"there is no market for such gems of art here, and I shall have to
take the picture to New York, or perhaps to London."
"There is the National Gallery, they have none too many Hogarths."
"Yes; it might go there. But you will understand the trouble I
have with all these things."
A good many people would like a few of Mrs. Stevenson's trou
bles, especially when they Include the care of an original Hogarth.
They do not. however, seem to oppress the lady unduly.
"I am going first to Riverside," she went on. outlining her project
ed travels, "to spend a few days with my brother, J. Van de Grift.
Mind you, spell it right, Van, then a little de "
"Oh, I know how to spell it," I replied.
"How do you know?" said Mrs. StevenÃon. looking up astonished.
"Why. it's in the dedication to Prince Otto, 'To Nelly Van de Grift.' "
"So it Is. that was my sister. But to continue my journey. After
leaving Riverside, I am going south to New Orleans, and from there
to Washington, where I will remain until I leave New York on May
10 in the Kaiser Wllhelm der Grosse."
"Is there anything of Mr. Stevenson's left to publish?" I asked, by
way of conclusion.
"No, I think not; there may be a few fragments, scattered here and
there, which there is some talk of collecting, but practically the 'Weir
of Hermiston' Is the last of his works."
"It is a pity he did not live to finish It."
"It is." she agreed, with a sigh. "I think It would have been his
masterpiece. And I may tell you that he had planned another novel
which would perhaps have been an even greater work. It was to have
been called 'Sophia Scarlet,' and all the characters were to be female."
"Mr. Stevenson," I put in, "onco told me that his heroines were his
despair. He did not consider himself riualified to draw the woman from
life."
"Yes; but that was long ago; he changed afterward, and 'Sophia
Scarlet 1 was to have been full of real live women, living on a planta
tion somewhere in the Tropics and going through all sorts of marvel
ous adventures. We used to have long talks about the story, but un
fortunately it never got beyond the embryonic stage."
NO PLACE FOR
POOR YOUTHS
Nearly All the Asylums
and Homes are Over
crowded.
Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty Cannot Find
Homes.
Many of Their Cases Are From th<s
Country and Not Eligible
Here.
A study of the local situation regard
ing the condition of children belonging
to the defective and dependent classes
in this city shows that there are not
enough sheltering homes for those who
are confronted by destitution.
There is scarcely a day that there are
not worthy applications for food and
shelter for children who begin each day
at the very door of want. It 1b probable
that these conditions are largely the
result of enforced idleness of parents
whose earnings rave been curtailed or
completely arrested by dull times in
their particular fields of industry.
Secretary Parnell of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children is
having much difficulty in finding any
place where he can put his charges, even
temporarily, on account of the over
crowded condition of all of the homes
and hospitals for children. This was
most forcibly impressed upon him when
he recently tried to place six little ones
where they would be sheltered for a
few days. The case was that of the
family of George Pepper, of 119 San
Carlos avenue. The father is out of
work and the agents of the house have
theatened to evict the family. In jus
tice to the agents they would not drive
the family out until they had seen
Colonel Parnell and toid him of the
condition of the tenants. Application
was made by the secretary at all of
the homes and he received the same
answer, that there was no room for any
more.
The one exception to the condition of
overcrowding is found at the Little
Sisters' Infant Shelter, but this is not
wholly a charitable home. It is a place
where little children and babes of
working mothers are cared for at a
fee of 5 to 10 cents a day. A few chil
dren of destitute parents might be sent
to this establishment if pome one
J. F. ROSE-SOLEY.
Â£SS.th2 e SS Â£? res S ,b,llty of
The superintendent of the Boys' and
Girls' Aid Society says he has no fur
ther accommodations for girls though
there is still room for about twenty,
five boys. In response to a question as
to the reason of the inability of the su
ti^nTf^T Â« tO , fUr i liSh
tions for the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children, he said- "The
reason is that our society is maintained
by the charitable people of San Fran
cisco, and we cannot give accommo
dations to the other society because its
agent 3 scour the entire State for desti
tute and suffering children. We do not
think it is right for the people of this
city to be compelled to pay for those
out of the city. Again, we like to keep
children awhile so as to do something
toward teaching them how to meet the
world. The society that cares for chil
dren who have been abused is In the
habit of coming here with a child and
taking him out almost at once. This
disarranges our system entirely."
The Maria Kip Orphanage is another
asylum where there is no overcrowding
of children, though only orphans or half
orphans are admitted, and if any child
in either of these two classes apply
they are Immediately provided for.
With comfort forty-eight children more
can be cared for.
The Youths' Directory until yes
terday morning was crowded, but at
that time six of the boys left and so
there Is that vacancy. Father Crow
ley stated that he never turned away
any urgent case that came under his
notice. The directory can accommo
date about . seventy-five and there are
now in the building sixty-nine. "When
they start coming," said the reverend
j father, "it is a case of it never rains
\ but it pours." .
The Hebrew Orphan Asylum is one of
the few that has all the room it wants
and can accommodate about 100 more.
The San Francisco Nursery for Chil
dren is also obliged to turn away on
the average one child a day, as they
have not enough bedding to accommo
date them. They are now keeping sev
enty-six, while four more could be
easily accommodated if they had the
necessities. They could give no reason
for the number of children of late that
needed homes.
The Ladies' Protection and Relief So
ciety are caring now for fifteen children
more | than they can conveniently ac
commodate. Every day come more ap
plications, and every day ! they have to
be refused. When one of the members
was asked why this condition of affairs
existed, she replied that she thought
that there were so many children whose
parents were out of 1 work, and rather
than have them starve they place them
in these homes while at any other, time
they would hold up their hands in holy
horror of that Idea.

A NEW RECORD
FOR COASTERS
Quick Passage of the
Schooner Beulah to
Grays Harbor.
Made the Run From Port to
Port in Steamboat
Time.
Miss Deair Johanson, "The BellÂ© of
the Water Front," Married to
Harry Worsdale.
The schooner Beulah has established
a new record for coasters. She left
here February 23, in the afternoon, and
on the morning of February 26 was at
anchor in Grays Harbor. She dis
charged, took on a load of lumber and
got away for San Francisco on the sth
inst. A remarkably quick piece of
work. If good luck attends the vessel
and she makes a quick run down the
coast Captain Mitchell will have a
round trip to his credit that a steamer
might be proud of. The chances are
against him, however, as all the coast
ers are making long passages. The
fleet from Grays Harbor Is now out
from ten to fourteen days and those
that have reached port report very
heavy weather off the coast of Mendo
cino.
The schooner Ida Schnauer from Fort
Bragg for San Pedro had to put in
here In distress. Off the coast of Men
docino she was caught in a heavy
southeaster and part of her deck load
was carried away. The cabin was
flooded and the forecastle gutted. The
schooner was severely strained so the
captain decided to run for San Fran
cisco.
The agents of the steamer Curacoa
are keeping a bright lookout for the
vessel these days. She is much needed
because of the Alaskan trade and can
not get here too soon to please Messrs.
Goodall, Perkins & Co. The Cottage
City took fifty-nine days to come here
from New York, the Valencia took
fifty-five days to come from Baltimore
and the Curacoa is now out sixty-six
days from Baltimore. She is not nearly
as fast a boat as the Cottage City or
Valencia, however, so no fears are felt
for her safety. On her arrival here the
Curacoa is to be fitted with the How
den system of forced draught and it is
expected to add at least two knots an
hour to her speed. When her repairs
are completed she will probably re
place the Orizaba on the Mexican
route, while the new steamer Senator,
now being completed at the Union Iron
Works, will go on the Alaskan route.
The Orizaba will be put on the San
Diego trade.
Captain Blackburn and his crew of
gold hunters from Gloucester, Mass.,
who came around the Horn in the
schooner Hattie I. Phillips, are not
going to sit down and patiently await
the opening of the Yukon. They have
chartered their vessel to carry lumber
from Grays Harbor and are going to
do all the work themselves. Lumber
freights are now high and the fisher
men miners from Gloucester will earn
considerable money while awaiting the
opening of the river. If they can sell
the Phillips they will go to St. Michael
by steamer. If they can't get a fair
price for her they will sail her to the
mouth of the Yukon or Kotzebue
Sound. ,
The first steamers for use on Lake
Bennett and the waters of the upper
Yukon are to go to Skaguay on the
steamer Dirigo. They have been built
by the Risdon Iron Works for the Up
per Yukon Transportation Company,
and are 50 feet long, 10 feet broad and
2 feet 6 inches deep. They have been
built In sections, and will be taken over
the Chilcoot Pass to their destination.
Twelve men are going up with the
boats to put them together at Lake
Kennett.

P. A. McGuire was found dead in his
bed Saturday night at 5368 Howard street,
Michael McManus. the proprietor of the
house, entered McGuire's room and found
him lying in bed with his head covered.
He pulled down the clothes and found
McGuire dead, with his face covered with
blood. The man had been sick for some
time, and it was supposed that he had
died from a hemorrhage. When the
Coroner's deputy arrived he discovered a
pistol in the dead man's hand and a bullet
hole in his head.
A note was In McGuire's pocket ad
dressed to the Coroner, and stating that
he had killed himself by taking morphine
and laudanum, and requesting that no
autopsy bo held and that Joseph White
head and Dr. McKondry of this city be
notified of his death. The note was un
signed, and the writer gave as his reason
that he had brought enough disgrace on
his "kin" already.
Papers found on the body indicated that
McGuire lived at Fort Worth, Tex., under
the name of Mark Phillips. He had lived
at the place where he killed himself for
about six weeks, and had paid his rooom
rent up to two days ago. No money or
valuables were found, but there was a re
ceipt from the Bank of Commerce of this
city showing that McGuire had deposited
a check for $f>o, drawn on the Farmers'

"THE WOMEN OF
THE PASSION."
Rev. E. P. Dempsey Delivers a
Strong Sermon at St.
Mary's Cathedral.
Second Sunday in Lent Observed
With Impressive Ceremony
and Beautiful Music.
St. Mary's Cathedral was crowded to
the doors yesterday with worshipers, and
the second Sunday in Lent was observed
with impressive ceremony. The services
were held under the auspices of the CUl
vnrlan Society and special music was ar
jaigred for the occasion. The cathedral
choir was augmented by the Young
Ladies' Sodality choir, and the music
was a pleasing feature of the service.
They rendered "Stabat Mater." "Vent
Creator," "Jesu Dei Vivi" (Roseivia), "O
Salutaris" and "Tantum Ergo," chorus
(A. Capella).
The object of the Calvarian Society is
to aid the souls in purgatory tbiough the
devotion of the "way of the cross." This
devotion was first introduced into Jeru
salem, among the Christians who dwelt
there, out of veneration for those sacryd
Spots which were sanctitied by the suf
fering* of Christ. From the Holy City
tills devout exercise was introduced into
Europe. When in 1342 the Franciscan
fathers established their house \n Jeru
salem and undertook the custody of the
sacred places of the Holy Land they began
to spread throughout the world the devo
tion of the "way of the cross."
At the conclusion of the ceremony Rev.
E. P. Dempsey delivered an interesting
sermon, choosing as his subject "The
Women of the Passion." In part he said:
"The gospel history presents to us three
beautiful pictures in which the women of
Jerusalem take a prominent part. As our
Savior goes along the way of the cross,
Veronica, moved by a characteristic
spirit of woman, that of pity and com
passion, and despite the taunts and jeers
of the maddened crowd, wipes the face

THE LATEST BURGLARY IN
THE WESTERN ADDITION
Officer Green and Four Other Policemen
Pursue the Miscreant hut Fail
to Capture Him.
It was 2 o'clock last Thursday morn
ing when the family was aroused toy
one of the members who had been lying
awake trying to convince herself that
she heard nothing suspicious, that no
unusual noise disturbed the serene
night, thatâ in short, that the best
thing to do was to turn over and go to
sleep again.
But the alarming sounds were heard
again, and the 16-year-old daughter
slid softly out to bed, passed noiselessly
into her sister's bedroom and in awed
whispers communicated the fact that
at last their turn had come. There had
been burglaries all over the Western Ad
dition. Now, indeed, their hour had
struck.
The two girls took counsel, and at
last hit upon the simple expedient of
summoning the police. Gathering all
the breath fright had left in her, feel
ing as powerless to make a sound as
one does in a nightmare, or as a
woman when she sees a wished-for car
fleeing past her, the 16-year-old hero
ine put a police whistle to her lips. She
blew and blew. Then with the con-
Bciousness that only the speedy ap
pearance of a blue-coated officer stood
between them and the revenge of the
b.'ld burglar below stairs, the family
waited.
Strange to say, the noise below did
not cease. Tho girls sat motionless.
What a desperate wretch he must be
wh'> would continue his nefarious em
ployment after being warned by the
piercing fream of the police whistle!
It is well known â or it should be
among burglars â that when a woman
blows a police whistle it is not so much
for the purpose of bringing the police
as it is to frighten the burglar away.
But this burglar evidently was a
stranger to fear. The strange noises
below increased, and just as the two
girls were about to swoon with fearful
suspense the sound of the policeman's
footsteps on the front steps revived
them.
The cautious officer â his name is
Green â entered and listened to the
whispered explanation the frightened
women gave. Indeed, it wasn't neces
sary for them to explain fully, for a
corroborative thump came from below
stairs, and the guardian of the street's
safety drew his revolver and started
out upon an investigating tour.
The women waited, their fingers in
their ears, that they might not hear.
But time elapsed and nothing hap
pened, except at intervals those muf
fled sounds that had first alarmed the
household.
Presently the brave policeman re
turr.ed.
"Well? Well?" came the question
from throats, dry with anxiety.
But the gravity of the affair had im
pressed Officer Green. He had no posi
COUNTY HOSPITAL
MUST BE REMOVED
A. Mass- Meeting Is Held at
Maennerbund Hall by Im
provement Clubs.
Three Organizations Are Incor
porated Into a Single
Body.
A mass-meeting to agitate the removal
of the City and County Hospital and to
consi'" r and adopt various other resolu
tions for the benefit of the residents of
the Mission was held at Maennerbund
Hall, at Twenty-fourth street and Po
trero avenue, yesterday afternoon. Al
though the resolution of the removal of
the hospital was paramount to all others,
the subject of the filling in of the swamp
lands between Twenty-sixth and Army
streets and San Bruno avenue, and a
resolution to extend Folsom street were
also brought up for consideration and
adopted.
A short time ago the important con
clusion was reached by members of the
Improvement clubs that without concert
ed action and the necessary influence the
Board of Supervisors would not hold to
their promise of removing the County-
Hospital from itÃ present site to the
Almshouse tract.
This combination of the three distinct
improvement organizations, although in
corporated for the attainment of a com
mon object, could not refrain from the
opportunity of stating their own indi
vidual needs as paramount to the removal
of the hospital, and for awhile it looked
as though dissection were rapidly breed
ing, which would ultimately terminate in
a free exhibition of fistic argument. Su
perrisor Kottanzi, however, found the
Key to the solution of the difficulty, and
held up the argument that when the resi
dents of the Mission, through the com
bined efforts of the members of the im
tive information to give as to the des
perate criminal below. After listening
cautiously, he had decided that it would
be foolhardy for any one man to at
tempt the capture of so bold an offend
er. Running to the nearest corner,
therefore, leaving the family to quake
till his return. Policeman Green put his
whistle to his lips and blew a blast
that roused California street from Bu
chanan to Seiner. Then he returned
to comfort the startled family with his
presence â which is a sturdy, solid six
f(-et by four of comfort, it is not to be
denied.
The two girls sat pale and still, hold
ing each other's hands, not daring to
breathe freely till the stillness of the
night was broken by the approaching:
swift tread of the reUef party.
Then they hid their heads in the pil
lows, while the sergeant and his four
valiant men started determinedly to
apprehend the disturber. Softly, their
pistols in their hands, their eyes on the
alert for the enemy, they filed through
the downstairs rooms. Nothing was
disturbed. Everything had the dumb,
waiting appearance of living rooms late
at night. Suddenly the noise was again
heard.
"In the basement!" whispered Officer
Green.
Cautiously they crept out Into the
yard: carefully but with courageous de
termination they forced the basement
door. The five six-footers entered.
Upstairs the girls waited, mistaking
their own heart-beats for the report of
the revolvers they expected and dread
ed to hear. At last the elder raised a
pale, determined face from the friendly
pillow. She heard an indescribable
noise, a confusion of terrible sounds;
then the fail of a heavy body. She
shivered, and, quickly muffling her
pretty ears with the pillow, she heard
no more.
The five six-footers had entered the
basement, grimly watchful. They en
tered, and the family cat, terrified by
their unexpected appearance, out of the
convulsions, which had been the cause
of all the noise, bounded out and past
them like a bewitched streak of black
lightning, knocking down in her flight
mighty Officer Green, whose beat in
cludes this especial house.
When the younger girl, whose strong
sense of duty told her it was her time
this time to listen, raised a pitiful face
from the pillow, she thought that the
intense nervous strain of that awful
night must have driven her mad. For
she heard â not the report of a pistol,
not the long-drawn shriek of a soul in
agony, but a guffaw frum four burly
chests that shook the house, and pene
trated through two floors to the quak
ing girls above.
The funniest part of it, though, is the
fact that that guffaw seems to be never
endmg. Officer Green says that he, too.
has a sense of humor â although he
didn't Join in the broadside of laughter
that met the astonished cat last Thurs
day before dawn â but he insists that
the joke is laughed out. Four other
biave policemen out in the Western Ad
dition don't agree with him. What's
more, they can't mention Thursday
morning last or California street or Po
liceman Green without firing a volley
of laughter which makes that poor, re
formed household cat shiver with ap
prehension.
provement clubs, shall have obtained the
removal of the hospital they could turn
their attention toward the improvement
of other sections of the district.
The meeting was unusuallly well at
tended for a Sunday afternoon, and much
interest was manifested in the adoption
of the proposed resolutions.
Among the prominent speakers who
were in favor of the removal of the hos
pital were Supervisors Clinton and Rot
tanzi, J. J. Gilfour, Dr. W. H. Tubbs, L.
J. Dwyer, Henry Meyer and J. B. Vaz
zard.
A resolution indorsing the action of the
Board of Supervisors in their proposal of
erecting a new hospital on the Almshouso
tract was unanimously carried.
Dr. Rottanzt. in speaking of the neces
sity of removing the hospital, averred
that he would vote for its removal before
he would cast a ballot in favor of estab
lishing the contemplated zoo In the Mis
sion.
A meeting of the league will be held the
first Sunday in April.
SELL WARRANTS TO MANY.
Auditor Broderick Annoyed by the
Actions of City Employes.
Auditor Broderick is growing impatient
over the manner in which the brokers are
turning in assignments of the salaries of
various City Hall employes. It is not
Infrequently the case that three or four
demands for the same month come in and
are quietly filed away by the Auditor,
who hands the demand to the first claim
ant and allows the others to fight it out
with the man who did the assigning.
A certain deputy in the County Clerk's
office is one of those who is causing the
Auditor considerable annoyance. Three
brokers held assignments on his February
salary, and two have already come in for
that of March. Mr. Broderick is looking
for some means of putting a stop to the
practice of duplicate hypothecation.

THE SAX FHAXCISCO CALL, MONDAY, 3IAKCH 7, 1898.
ECLIPSE OF A STAR.
Miss Affie Warner Thought She Owned
the Place.
MISS OLIVE HOFF, THE NEW "CISSY."
The troubles of the leading lights in the histrionic world are certainly
many and varied. It all depends upon the magnitude of the histrionic
star. Carter vs. Belasco in a sensational suit for damages has been heard
of in one extreme of the continent, and now it bids fair that Affie Warner
vs. Harry Corson Clarke will be the sensation in the other. And that so
soon after the popular comedian has become elevated from leading come
dian in a stock company to a star and manager of his own.
Affie Warner, with blood in her eye, has declared that she will sue Mr. i
Clarke for damages and a season's salary in the sum of $10,000.
She will take this action because of Mr. Clarke having engaged in her
place Miss Olive Hoff. a California girl and actress of great talent, and of
whom it has been predicted by her former Instructors that she will become
another Modjeska or Bernhardt.
Miss Warner states that after playing Oakland the night after the
company closed at the Columbia in this city they vere to leave next morn-
Ing for San Jose on the 9:30 train, but hat after the performance she de
cided to return to the city and pay certain bills before leaving, for which
purpose she asked Clarke and his manager, Mr. Loos, for an advance on
her week's salary, yet without securing the same. Next morning she tele
graphed Mr. Clarke that she would take the 2:30 p. m. train for San Jose,
but soon received a reply that Clarke had filled her place. Nevertheless she
presented herself at the theater asking to be assigned a dressing room.
She now claims that Mr. Clarke there called her names and secured her
removal from the stage by means of a police officer because she refused to
leave when asked. For this reason she will allege in her complaint assault
and battery, libel and defamation of character
Mr. Broadhurst, the author of Clarke's starring play "What Happened
to Jones," if Miss Warner's threats develop, as she hopes they will, may find
material for a new play for his star, entitled "What Happened to Clarke."
Miss Warner, however, not being satisfied with causing Clarke something
to think about, seeks balm for her wounded feelings which ten thousand of
Clarke's golden dollars only will completely heal by charging that Miss Hoff
was her understudy and was engaged by Mr. Clarke from reasons of econ
omy.
Those who have inside information of the affair, however, tell a different
story. They say that Mr. Clarke's manager, Mr. Loos, on the eventful night
when Miss Warner demanded her little advance, in the first hour of the
morning called at the residence of Miss Hoff and roused her out of sweet
slumber by loud hammering and terrifically -working the doorbell. When he
finally secured a hearing he asked her if she could pack up her trunk at
once and be at the ferry by 8 o'clock in the morning.
Miss Leila Davis, an actress of Salt Lake City, from which place she ac
companied Miss Hoff to San Francisco, said: "Miss Hoff was taken abso
lutely by surprise, as only the night before she had had an interview with
Mr. Clarke, who very seriously objected to the salary she demanded as be
ing too high, yet said he would like her to study the part of Cissy, for
merly played by Miss Warner, and be ready to come at a moment's notice,
as he would telegraph for her should Miss Warner for any reason fail him.
However, Miss Hoff, being much pressed, finally agreed to be at the train
on time, and at 1 o'clock in the morning sent for me to assist her to pack
and get ready."
Mr. Loos, when asked for the reason of this sudden change of leading
ladies, said:
"Miss Warner seemed to think that she was the only one in the world
who could play Cissy, so last night after the performance in Oakland she
demanded an advance on her week's salary, stating that unless she got it
she would not play the next night in San Jose. Well, we decided not to
make the advance demanded, and not daring to take the chances to reach
San Jose without a leading lady, I lost no time in engaging Miss Hoff."
Such is the story of the trials of the well-known comedian, yet as a
proper ending it may be necessary to quote from a letter written by a
member of the company the morning after the performance: "Affle Warner
came up last night and raised the . Mr. Clarke turned her over to two
policemen, one on the stage to keep her off, the other in the front to keep
her out."
Many of Miss Hoff's friends will no doubt be a.nxious to know how-
Miss Warner can justify the statements that, "she" was "her" understudy
and that she was engaged by Mr. Clarke out of reasons of economy. An
extract from a letter written by Miss Hoff en route to one of her friends may
to some extent clear the mystery: "I am studying all the time on Cissy;
Mr. Clarke wants me to play an entirely different version from Affie
Warner."

Ever since John H. Dickinson assumed
the office of Major General of the Nation
al Guard of this State, the rumor has
been circulated by a number of individ
uals that "the Major General will request
a number of those on his staff to resign,"
and although the division commander has
been as dumh as an oyster on that sub
ject, those individuals have selected "the
members of the staff who will be asked
to resign." The fact Is that the Major
General, if he docs intend to make any
changes, and it is probable that he will,
will not have to request "a number of
those on his staff to resign," for the rea
son that the resignation of 'every one on
the staff is already in his hands and has
been since the day' he took office; it simply
remains for him to accept such as he may
select.

sented a grand military exhibition,includ
ing a review. It is expected that the two
local divisions of the Naval Militia will
take part and give an exhibition of gun
drill. There will be two special features,
which it is not desired to announce at this
time. There will also be a display of the
Buzzecott ovens, to show how each com
pany can prepare mess for the men. and
an exhibition by the sanitary corps of the
regiment. The men of the regiment ex
pected that the oiate. ordering them to
engage in target practice, would provide
them with a suitable range, but as it
will not provide either a suitable or a.ny
other range, they find that, in order to
comply with the law. they will have to
go among their friends to peddle tickets
for the entertainment.

For a second time a picked team
of ten men from Company E has
won honors in a rifle contest
with a picked team from the
State University Corps. The Visalians
scored 421 points out of a possible 500,
while the Berkeleyites made but 387. I.he
winning team is composed of J. L. Bowen,
A. B. Shippey, R. H. Renick, J. S. Clack,
George Osborne. Fred W. Ward. C. C.
Lofland, F. W. Mixter, W. E. Woodward
and Walter Shippey. The distance was
200 yards, and Bowen led with a score
of 44.
THE NAVAL MILITIA.
Captain Louis H. Turner, commanding
the Naval Militia, on his return from the
unsuccessful trip on the Pinta, found his
presence is required in Alaska in connec
tion with some insurance- matters, and he
left for that point last Saturday after
noon, to be absent about four or six
weeks. In the meantime the comman- of
the militia will devolve on Lieutenant-
Commander T. A. Nerney, the executive
officer.
Everything seems to be In shipshape
aboard the Marion, and the men of the
two divisions are being instructed in ship
drill. These drii.s are held every Tues
day night, and on t riday nights all the
line officers except Lieutenant Gunn who
is a practical navigator, meet to receive
instructions in navigation.

Political Balloons Are Now
Being Ambitiously In

If Consolidation Will Tend to Purify
Politics It Will Be

Oakland Office San Francisco CaU,
908 Broadway, March 6.
If Oakland were sincere, she would
soon be a great and Important city.
But her sincerity in the past has been
evanescent, and the city's growth has
been thereby impeded. One fact Will
both illustrate and prove this point at
the same time. Eight years ago* Oak
land hooted and yelled at and hung in
effigy several <>f her Councilmen.
Among them were Brosnahan, Helt
man and Eai. Since that time Helt
man has not failed of re-election each
two years; Brosnahan has enjoyed the
same evidence of the voters' good will,
except once, when he did not seek elec
tion, and Earl was returned last spring.
A city does not change its population
In eight years, and therefore the pre
sumption is natural that, the same peo
ple who hooted and reviled effigies eight
years ago are the same who returned 1
the orginals of the effigies to the Coun
cil and who hooted and yelled last
week and will do so again to-morrow
night
Since it is apparent that nothing but
the dropping dead of two of the Solid
Six can save the users of water from
Wing robbed during the next year by
the vote that will !>â¢â  t.iken to-morrow
night, it is opportune to call attention
fact that the personnel of a City
Council is not perpetual. There is only
one efficient way to right wrongs and
that is at tho bailot-box. No doubt
next spring the same gang will
tome up when the box is rattled and
the same influence will be used to elect
them. It now remains to be seen
whether Oakland's memory can retain
events for one year â it has often failed
to do so in the past. Really, Mr.
Woodward was not fo perfectly reck
less a few days ago when he said, with
a nonchalant air: "This affair will soon
blow over and be forgotten."
Will it?
Unfortunately Oakland has but little 'â 
faith in any good result coming from :
the investigation of a Grand Jury. The
present Grand Jury is more than usu- |
ally representative of the people and
it is going about its work with care and
thoroughness. There is certainly a
story to unfold, but even if the facts
are discovered and some indictments '
found that -will probably be the end'
of it. Indictments of officials by grand
juries have lost much of their terror in
Alameda County. During the past few
years there have been over a score of, j
indictments found, but not In a single j
instance has a conviction been ob
tained. It would indeed be a surprise
â to see air unfaithful official pay the
penalty of his malfeasance.
It is amusing to watch the tactics of
the professional and office-holding poli
ticians. Already the fall campaign is
mapped out, all the offices are filled,
many combinations are made and State
and county are scheduled to go hand
in hand. Everybody who is "in" is
slated for an office, and some of the
).n -sportive appointments of the Gov
ernor whom the combination will elect
are also filled. Everything is guaran
teed to work smoothly and only one
nt in the happy dream is doubt
ful. That element is the people, and
"the people" of Alameda County is a
very dangerous element with which to
date. At present the lion and the
a of old are creeping into each
s camp and lulling themselves
int.. the sleep of fancied security,
while imagining that they hear some
metaphysical "Home, Sweet Home" in
the air. How lung it will last is a
The most strained efforts are
being made to unite the State and
county issues and the two sets of aspir
ants are now engaged in patting each
other on the back and saying pretty
things one of the other.
The center of interest now is the
Republican County Central Commit
tee, and right there a little snag ap
pears. <)n<- of the committee admits h<>
is a candidate for a county office, and
there is as y-t no evidence that he is in
the combination â and he is not alone.
However, tho balloon is barely off the
ground as yet and there is no doubt
that it will be liberally punctured both
from without and within before it has
ascended very high.
As soon as the excitement over the
water rates has subsided the public
interest will again revert to politics,
and Alameda County was never more
thoroughly in politics than it is at pres
ent. The ambition of the county to
nominate a Republican Governor has
drawn toward it more attention from
the balance of the State than ever be
fore, and for the first time in six years
it is very clear that some San Fran
cisco Democratic politicians are earn
estlj taking a hand in trying to shape
the destiny of the gubernatorial can
didates. The intrusion is, as might he
supposed, not based on sincerity, and
from the manner in which the Scheme
is being worked it is very apparent
that its object is to make impossible
the nomination of either Pardee or
Davis and to strengthen the cause of
Maguire by creating dissatisfaction in
the Republican camp. The possible
disaster is not fully realized as yet, but
by degrees the cat is jumping out of
the bag, and there promises to be a
lively scattering before long. It is
noticeable that many parts of the
State are putting forth candidates, but
always with the reservation that if
Alameda can put forth a strong man
and agree upon him he will probably
receive the nomination for the head of
the ticket. There is no more prospect
of either man withdrawing than there
was three months ago, and it now
s.-ems likflv that they will both lead
delegations to the State convention.
As both men have money to burn the
hosts are rejoicing at the prospect.
Oakland Is now earnestly considering
the consolidation of city and county,
and although much has been said in its
favor, but little has been said against
it. Twelve years ago there was some
talk of a consolidation, and it fell
through. It -was natural that it should
do bo. At that time there was not an
inch of electric road in the county, nor
for four years after. A crazy horflecar
ran to Alameda at intervals, and
Berkeley was really farther off than
San Francisco. East Oakland could
not be reached aft*-r dark beyond Thir
teenth avenue except by the local train,
and to go to Highland Park was an
afternoon's task. Now; what are the.
conditions? The three cities are tied to
ALAMEDA COUNTY NEWS.
gpther with the fastest and most com
plete system of electric roads In the
country. CarÃ fly around Alamedo, and
through Oakland from both east and
west, and branches go over the Encinal
City; Berkeley Is reached by one
straight line and a loop line equal to
two routes; four lines run to West
Oakland, and three to East Oakland,
and a stranger riding from Bay Farm
Island across the estuary, through Oak
land and out to the university, a dis
tance of about eight miles, would see
nothing to indicate that it was not all
one rapidly developing town. Just at
this time, public opinion will be guided
by but one argument. If it can be
shown that a consolidation will have a
purifying effect on politics it will be
popular, and otherwise it will not.

yer, the newly chonen pastor of t~e Cen
tral Christian Church, who succeeds Rev-.
Edwards I>avis, occupied his pulpit both
morning and evening to-day. In his open
ing remarks he said:
"I am glad this morning to meet some
of the many followers of our Lord in this
delightful land of fruit and flowers, and
to feel that in our future sacred relation
ship as pastor and people. I may become
the humble Instrument in God s haul for
the blessing of some life in this beautiful
city As your future pastor. I have no
extravagant promises to make; no proeiii
tnatlons of policy, no outlining o. meth- |
OdsT lime alone" will tell whether or not I
you have acted wteely in calling me to
Become your pastor and teacher; whether,
or not I have acted wisely Id accepting it.
That I am not here because oi any nntin
cial Inducements offered you have doubt
lese l- arned ere this.
â¢â¢1 do not come to you with any new i
I nor do 1 seek any new means of
nting the old one. Jesus Christ is
the Ham-- yesterday, to-day and forever.
One great ' truth, however, that I would
suggest to you and that I shall strive to i
constantly before you. is the mar
velous power of a life with which Cod â 
has entrusted each of you, and that the
eternal salvation or damnation of
predOUS souls depends very largely upon
your use or abuse of that power."
THE MUNICIPAL
LEAGUE SPEAKS
Compares Its Record With
' That of the Present
Council.
Denounces the Shameful Betrayal of
the Sacred. Trust Given
Them.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Marcn 6.
The central committee of the Citizens' j
Municipal League, Cary Howard presi- i
dent and Lowell J. Hardy Jr. secretary, >
issued the following manifesto to-day:
I The Citizens 1 Municipal League calls the at
tention of the citizens to the fact that lor the
: four years before the election of the present
Councilmen there -has been no scandal in the
affairs of our City Council,' and that during
that time a majority of the members of that
body were persons indorsed or nominated ana
i elected Â»>y the eTorts of this league. *
: That during 'U.* four years the charges fixed ,
by the City C.'U.icil for water supplied to the
, citizens were a jut 40 per cent less than ever
before.
That the members of this league. In com
mon with all good citizens, condemn the recent ,
action of the majority of the present City ,
Councilmen in fixing water rates for the ensu- i
ing year with such Indecent haste, in a manner
bo arbitrary- and. suspicion*. and without in
vestigation and under circumstances : which â 
seem to warrant an inference that corrupt
means were used to produce such result; and
we denounce such action and the manner in :
which it was accomplished as a shameful be- ,
trayal by the majority of such Council of the i
sacred trust reposed in theji t>y the voters of "
this city, and that mich action renders the
individuals composing -such majority unworthy
of any further confidence. _ ;
We call atteneion to the fact that all in
dorsees of this league in the Council have stood
fearlessly for a fair consideration of the ques- j
tion of "fixing water rates.
We commend the action of the minority in j
the Council in. opposing- the methods and acts
of the majority of that body in betraying our
city and the confidence of the voters.
We urge the Mayor to veto the ordinance
now under consideration fixing the water rates I
I for the ensuing year, if it shall be finally
adopted by action of the majority of the Coun- |
ell. â  "

Attorney Ofles&y, who resides at
Seventh and Broadway, rushed into the j
street last night and reported to the j
| police that burglars wen? in his office, S
which is next to his living room. The
frightened man was shouting for help |
and had not taken time to complete his
wardrobe.
An officer returned with Mr. Oglesby,
and a thorough search was made for
the robbers. As the doors were locked,
it Mas supposed that the burglars had |
escaped by way of the street, but no
trace of any one could be seen. The
hallways were searched, but nothing
could be found, and the- officer and the
attorney were about to give up the
hunt, when they heard a suspicious
noise coming from the office of Attor
ney Tom Oarrity. The searchers lis
tened in silence and could plainly hear
the burglar at work sawing open Colo
nel Garrity's cash box.
When the time was considered op
portune an entrance was effected, and
to the surprise of all not a burglar
could be seen. Every corner was
searched, and finally the attorney cried
out that he had found him. The offi
cer assisted Mr. Oglesby to effect the
capture of the villain, who was under
I the colonel's lounge.
After a couple of warnings the burg
lar did not show himself, and so the
I lounge was hastily moved. Beneath it
! was a nervous cat and seven brand new
kittens. The burglars were not ar
! rested. ,

DREYFUS AND ZOLA AS MARTYRS.
Never In the history of the Bush-street Temple has that edifice held such
a crowd as that which attended ihe lecture of Rabbi Myers on "Dreyfus and
Zola" last evening. Every seat was taken, and standing room was at a pre
i mium. During the eloquent remarks of the pastor it was with great effort
tnat the large gathering could restrain itself from breaking out in applause.
They could not withhold their appreciation for at the conclusion of the pow
erful speech they applauded with great vigor.
Rabbi Myers spoke with great force, and was listened to with profound
interest. In part, he said: Â«
"For some time past, throughout the length and breadth of the civilized
world one subject has attracted the interest of ah intelligent men and
women. Why has the Dreyfus case attracted so much interest? There is
inherent in the human heart one great eternal principle and that is justice,
and we measure, we gauge the -rogfeaa of an age, the condition and ad
vancement of society by the human justice that is manifested in its midst.
So, in the minds of all disinterested people, there is a strong feeling that
there has been a great miscarrin^ 1 ' of justice in a highly civilized society,
in one of the most civilized countries of the present age. Men and women
fe*t a (Jeef) interest in the proceeuings which were to bring to light tne "-uilt
or innocence ot a man, and the interest in that drama has been deepened,
for one of the actors in that drama happens to be a Jew: and then the
interest becomes greater when we find an example of most heroic courage
by one man, whose works are to be classed with the literature of France,
is a heroâ is one of the greatest heroes at this end of the nineteenth cen
tury." -no speaker then drew a vivid picture of the arrest of Dreyfus,
his incarceration, the treatment he received and the mental tortures he was
subjected to in order to wring a confession from his lips, and then he spoke
of the proceedings at his trial.
Then he went over the familiar scenes of Zola's trial, how the officers
of tne court were intimidated by the howling mob ana how the jury, after
being told by a general officer that "they were France," had retired and
brought in a verdict of guilty after a half-hour's deliberation. In concluding
his able remarks, the speaker said:
"Instead of sympa.-. zing with Dreyfus, who is living a miserable life;
instead. of sympathizing with Zola, whose name will live on even after his
books are forgotten I would ra-.er express my humiliation for France in
this hour of shame. It was not Dreyfus who was tried; it was not Zola
who was tried â it was France; and the jury that was watching the case was
not simply the twelve men chosen from the people, but was the jury of the
civilized world, and that voice of the world is the voice of Ood, and with
that feeiing that is inherent in the human heart we feel deeply for the
country that has been dragged down."

REVELRY AT
SHELL MOUND
The Picnic Season Opens
Happily and Au
spiciously.
Thousands of People Enjoy a
Day at This Popular
Resort.
Adolph Strscker Makes a New
World's Record With His
R He.
Between 8000 and 10,000 people visited
Shell Mound Park yesterday to partici
pate in the first picnic of the season at
that popular resort and help to mark
the opening of the shooting season for
this year.
The weather was all that could have
been desired, and the merrymakers en
tered with gleeful animation into the
pastimes provided by the management.
The big pavilion seemed at times
crowded almost to suffocation with the
dancers, who kept merry time to the
music of an excellent band throughout
the afternoon. The hundreds of chil
dren present got a generous dividend
at undiluted joy from the swings and
other appliances dedicated to juvenile
pleasures, and there were amusement
arid recreation in plenty and in diverse
forms for people of all ages and condi
tions.
This event marked the nineteenth
year of Captain L. Siebe's manage
ment of Shell Mound Park, and the
large attendance was a flattering trib
ute to his popularity. iTie captain was
given an almost endless series of ova
tions throughout the day, and many a
warm wish was expressed for his long
continued health and prosperity.
Notwithstanding the large crowd
present at the picnic grounds the order
was excellent â not an unpleasant feat
ure of any kind arising to mar the hap
piness of the occasion.
Great interest centered in the public
prize shooting match on the "man tar
get," under the auspices of the Nord
deutscher Schuetzen Club. This con
test was open to all comers, and for all
rilles excepting those with telescopic
sights. The competition developed some
wonderful shooting, and Shell Mound
supplies another new world's record in
marksmanship for this year. The high
est possible single shot on this target is
20. Four-shot scores ruled in this
match, making a possible SO. Adolph
Strecker's score was 19, 20, 20, 20, a
total of 79, which beats by one point
the best previous record known to the
rifle world. George Alpers made a good
second, with a score of 78. Cash prizes
aggregating $180 were given, ranging
in amount from $1 to $20, and the win
ners, with their scores, were as fol

AT SCHUETZEN PARK.
California Club and Verein Ein
tracht Hold Contests.
The rifle range at Schuetzen Park,
near San Rafael, was almost deserted
yesterday except by the marksmen of
the California Schuetzen Club and the
Han Francisco Vereln Eintracht, and
members of these organizations com
pleted their shooting in the monthly
contests as rapidly as possible and
caught an early train back to the
metropolis in order to be at the open
ing shoot at Shell Mound Park.
Among the marksmen present, how
ever, there was the usaal enthusiasm
and the scores in the medal contest of
the California Schuetzen Club were
very good. The light on the target was
strong throughout the day.
In the first champion class of the
California Schuetzen Club, John F.
Robinson took first prize. Robinson
has done some excellent shooting late
ly. Last year he captured the State's
gold medal in the military shooting,
and in the first champion class of the
California Schuetzen Club he is proving
himself to be an expert with the rifle.
In the second champion class, F. P.
Schuster and John Utschig Jr. are
keeping well together. Yuung Utschig
is a son of the veteran marksman, John
Utschig Sr., and the young man is de
fending the family's name as sharp
shooters in an admirable manner.
The scores of the marksmen of the
Verein Eintracht were not as good as
usual.
The opening shoot of the season on
the San Rafael range, will take place
on the third Sunday in April, and prizes
of considerable value will be offered.
The targets will be open to all and the
various shooting organiaztions will
take part in the festivities. The open
ing picnic at Schuetzen Park will be
held April 3, and Fred Schuemann, the
genial host, says that at least 6000 mer
rymakers will visit the park to cele
brate the occasion.
In the regular monthly medal shoot
of the California Schuetzen Club, the
following scores werÂ« made by the
marksmen:
First champion classâ prize, J. F.
Robinson, 430 points. .'",-.
Second champion classâ First prize. F.
P Schuster, 408 points; second prize, John

EXPLANATION.
The arrow files with the wind. The top fig
ares at rtatlon Indicate maximum temperature
for the days; those underneath it, if any, the
amount of rainfall, of melted snow In inches
and hundredths during the past twelve hours.
Isobars, or solid lines, connect points of equal
air pressure; isotherms, or dotted lines, equal
temperature. The word "high" means high
barometric pressure and Is usually accompanied
by fair weather; "low" refers to low pres
sure find Is usually preceded and accompanied
by cloudy weather and rains. "Lows" usually
first appear on the Washington coast. When
the pressure is high in the interior and low
along the coast, and the Isobars extend north
and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low? is Inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is Im
probable. With a '"high" in the vicinity of
Idaho, and the pressure falling to the Cali
fornia coast, warmer weather may be expected
Jn summer and colder weather In winter. The
reverse of these conditions will produce an
opposite result. . -

WANT TO
HANG THE
"GENERAL"
Fellow -Prisoners of
Duggan Eager for
a Lynching.
He Hints That Mrs. Clark's
Husband Is the Guilty
Monster.
The Army He Conducted Gave
Him and His Friends a
Lazy Living.
RELIGION ONLY A CLOAK.
â
"Major" Engleberg, Through a Trick ;
of His Attorneys, Enjoyed a
Few Hours' Freedom.
George Spurgeon Duggan, the self
styled general flf the Jesus Christ Army,
Is having an unpleasant time of it in
Jail. He was yesterday in a cell with |
a number of robbers and thieves, and ,
their demonstrations were anything but \
friendly toward him. Several times
they called for a rope, declaring that
they would hang their fellow-prisoner
should they get a chance. These dem
onstrations became so frequent that
Duggan began to fear for his life if
kept among them much longer, and he
called the jailer, and asked to be re
moved to another cell. His request was
granted, but he was then but little bet
ter off. His new cell mates showed him
very little friendship.
Duggan says he will prove his inno
cence when the case comes to trial. He
claims he will not only clear himself
from suspicion, but he will point the
linger toward the person who is guilty
of the crime. The witnesses, he says,
who will help him to prove it will be
John W. Pray and his wife, Minnie
Pray, of God's Regular Army and Mr.
and Mrs. Smith of the same organiza
tion. Mrs. Clark, the woman who was
Intrusted with the care of Alice Loy.
is also expected to assist in clearing
Duggan of the crime with which he is
charged. They claim Duggan could not
â¢well have been the cause of the girl's
condition, but they state that William
Clark, the husband of the woman who
brought the girl to San Francisco, Is
most likely the man who blighted the
child's life. Mrs. Clark, before her de
parture from Portland, confided in
friends certain acts of her husband that
put the stamp of brutality on him, and
after coming to this city she told Mr.
and Mrs. Pray and Mr. and Mrs. Smith
of her husband's condition, and that he
might be responsible for the blight on
the life of the child.
The few soldiers who followed Gen
eral Duggan in his abortive religious
wirrk do not believe their general is
guilty of the crime charged to him.
They tell in a deluded way of his great
zeal in his work, and how he gave his
whole time to the work of the army. ;
Duggan's army was a peculiar one. He !
and four followers for five years have :
been making a living on donations giv- j
en by a few charitably inclined people j
who paid little or no attention to the !
organization and took the representa
tions of the soldiers in good faith, and
donated accordingly. The soldiers may
have been sincere, as far as their idea
of sincerity went, but those who know
the inside workings of the army say it j
was kept up because of the lazy living
it gave those five who gloried in the ;
titles of generals, captains and majors. .
A principal source of income was to sell
meal tickets to merchants and those '
charitably inclined. The tickets were '
sold at 5 cents each, and business men ,
usually took them in bunches of twen
ty. They gave them out to persons
who applied to them for assistance,
and a ticket entitled the holder to either
a meal or a bed in the barracks of the
army. Seldom were the tickets re- j
deemed. The persons who were given
them hardly ever presented them. Bus- j
Iness men purchased them, considering j
It a good way to get rid of beggars, ;
and the generals and majors and cap- ;
tains of the army knew that they would '
seldom be called upon to make them j
gcrod.
Nearly every ticket they sold was
clear gain to them. "General" Duggan
had charge of the tickets. He called his
officers and soldiers to an accounting,
and when they made returns of their
Bales he took from sixty to seventy-five i
per cent for his share and allowed the
person who made the sale the balance ',
as his share. The soldiers every day !
visited a number of bakeries and res
taurants for donations of food for the
meals they represented they gave to J
the deserving poor who appealed to j
them for relief, and in that way the
generals and majors and captains man
aged to fatten and keep their cup- |
boards pretty well supiled. Their !
army was a limited one and there were
accordingly only a few to provide for.
The unfortunate fellows who were
obliged to request a meal from them
â were generally given stale bread and !
the leavings of the officers' coffee-pot.
W. Wilson, who resides at 1227 Mis
sion street, and who was a member of !
Duggan's army, tells many stories of
the inisde workings of the organiza
tion. He says one of Duggan's officers
Who went by the title of Lieutenant
Sinclair was given two meal tickets for
5 cents or forty for $1, and it was his
privilege to sell them to the charitably
inclined persons he met at twenty for
$1. Sinclair was a favorite officer, and
he was allowed to make all he could
in the name of charity. Wilson said he
left the army because it was so appar
ent a sham. He says Duggan was a
drunkard, and that he maintained dis
reputable relations with several women.
"Major" Bngleberg, who is accused
of battery on Benny Low, the brother
of the girl whom "General" Duggan is
said to have ill-used, was released
from prison on his own recognizance on
â Saturday night by Judge Low, but yes
terday the police were again looking
for him. Representation was made to
the Judge by the attorneys whom the
prisoner had engaged to defend him
that Engleberg was a hard-working
mechanic, and his crime only consisted
in slapping a s; Â« â >â¢ boy's face. Engle
berg was free during the night and the
greater part of yesterday. As soon as
Judge Low saw the papers giving ac
counts of the prisoner's crime he went
to the prison and revoked his order of
release and gave orders to the police to
take Engleberg in custody whenever
he should be found.
Late In the afternoon the accused
man visited the prison to offer spiritual
consolation to- Mrs. Clark, and he was
at once apprehended and put back Into
his cell.

STATECRAFT IN ACTION.
.
More Money Will Be Wanted J
in Several of the De
partments.
The letter of Mayor Phelan to the |
Auditor has caused more hot tempers |
than that of Mr. Broderick to waste a \
1 portion of vehemence on the city's |
! breezes; Dr. and Supervisor Rottanzi ,
! is the latest one to come to the front j
1 and center and defend the honor of
himself and the finance committee oi
the Board of Supervisors, of which he
is chairman.
Last Wednesday Broderick issued a
reply, which plainly showed the state
of his mind at being told he did not ;
know what the one-twelfth act was and
how it should operate, and now Rot
! tanzi is ready with figures which he !
â  has been digging up ever since the
; Phelan letter.
"I told him so," cries Rottanzi, as he j
! exultantly points to a deficit marked
' in red ink on a balance sheet of the
1 city's finances; "I told him so when the
tax levy was being made; I told him
there would be deficits; I told him there
would be a deficit amounting to $25,
' 000 in the health and police depart- j
ments, and even with the $17,000 they ;
added to the apportionment there is a
deficit of over $9000. I told him all this,
! and I knew it was coming."
The deficit in the health and police :
| departments is not the only one both- 'â 
; ering the Supervisors who have been
i suggested by the Mayor as the respon
sible parties. There may be a deficit in
1 the County Clerk's office of $43,000, and ;
i there is another one in the court order
fond of nearly $30,000. Of the court or- I
der fund the board has no control, but j
with the finances of the clerk's office ;
I they have everything to say.
When the Mayor left the city for an ;
i Eastern Jrip during the latter part of ,
i last year the board was in the midst of ;
' the consideration of some means to cur- ;
tail the expenses of the various depart- j
ments of the city government, and j
while he was absent a thorough inves- |
tigation into the situation was made by i
: the finance committee of the board. â¢
; The committee was about ready to re- j
I port when the Mayor returned, and the \
! report was made to him. He took n-.< j
\ action upon it. as at that time his days â¢
'â  were being taken up in the selection of
! the mushroom board which sprung up j
1 so suddenly, and whose advei.t was no ;
I more sudden than its speedy departure. !
The new board had no time for such !
work as the curtailing of expenses, and â 
so the departments were allowed to run
along as they would until the Finance
Committee tired of inaction and asked
that some notice be taken of the ap- |
proaching stringency. The Mayor's re- j
ply was that he could attend to that j
I matter himself; he had the power and '
he would exercise it as he thought best, j
i The matter thus being taken from the
bands of the Finance Committee it j
again dragged along until the Mayor
' one day, in a fit of unusual activity,
asked the Auditor to hold a warrant of
one of the County Clerk's copyists un
til he could see what he could do about !
it. The Auditor held the warrant for j
ten days, as he had promised he would, j
and then he hell it for three days more, ;
! but there was no further astion from the I
Mayor's office and so he let the war- ;
i rant go with his signature attached.
Then the Mayor once more became |
industrious, and this time his statecraft
suggested that he enjoin the Treasurer i
1 from paying the warrant and thus save
I the city the full amount of the copy- !
isfs pay. He enjoined the Treasurer,
but that was all the good it did, for the |
courts refused to interfere since the j
Auditor had passed the demand, the j
injunction was dissolved and the copy-
Ist drew his money, the only result of
! this move being the delay of his pay
day.
Now, according to the figures of the
i Finance Committee, the deficit is at '
hand. There is a difference of $43.- |
000 in the columns of what ought j
)to be and what is, and there |
i seems no way out of the difficulty but i
to express sorrow and sympathy for j
the taxpayer.
The Finance Committee of the board
! will take no blame for the state of af-
I fairs; the members say they investi
j gated the situation with the one pur-
I pose of guarding against just such a
j wind up to the fiscal year, and that ;
their work was made of no use by the j
action of the Mayor when he returned
! and took charge of things himself they
say is no fault of theirs; and if a deficit
Is at hand they can only join In a
i chorus of "I told you so."
There are eighty-five men In the
County Clerk's office, it is estimated,
and of them thirty-six are copyists.
The deficit In the Health and Police j
â  departments is the result of misman- i
' agement; there was a deficit from the
start, for every one familiar with the
workings of those departments knew
i they could not be run on the money al
' lowed. In the police patrol system
i alone the apportionments were $12,000
| below what It was known would be I
i needed, and that amount was finally |
j added, reducing the deficit to $1500. In
the case of the County Jail the esti
! mate was cut down until a shortage of i
'â¢ $8000 was apparent, and this was helped j
! with the addition of $2500. The appor- |
j tionments were made by Mr. Phelan
! and his own board, and the additional
j amounts were put in after the Phelan j
! board had been returned to their homes
j by the court.
There is, too. a shortage of $14,000 in
the fund for lighting public buildings,
and still the gas burns merrily all day
In the City Hall with never a word
from the Mayor. It saves coal bills to
heat a room by gaslight, and In some
of the offices they are very economical.
It saves gas bills, too, to turn on the
Incandescent lights, and so the wiring i
of the halt has not failed of its purpose. !
The deficit, however, is a matter the
taxpayers must attend to. It Is no
part of the Mayoralty.

THEIK ANNUAL MEETING.
The Mechanics' Institute Installs a
Board of Directors and Elects
Officers.
The forty-third annual meeting of the
Mechanics' Institute was held Saturday
at the Mining Fair Pavilion. A. S. Halli
die, Asa R. Wells and A. Van der Naillen
Installed the following board of directors:
George H. Wallis, P. J. Healey. George R.
Presson, J. H. Culver. Charles D. Steiger,
H. L. Tickner and E. P. Heald.
The board then elected the following
officers: President. E. A. Denicke; vice
president, Rodney Kendrick; recording
secretary, E. P. Heald. and corresponding
secretary, H. L. Trickner.
The librarian's report showed that the
Institute has a membership of 4385, which
is a def-rea.ee of 10S. although the receipts
show an increase of $570. This was caused
by weeding out the members until only
the most substantial are left. There are
now In the library 7<5,r>'.Â«5 volumes, and
there are 55S periodicals on the subscrip
tion list.
The most important gift that the li
brary received last year was the "Jeypore
Portfolio of Architectural Details," pub
lished by Maharajah of Jeypore. There
will be made a musical addition to the
library upon a small scale, so that the
members can obtain sheet music and the
scores of operas the same as they do
books.
The president in his report advocated
the appointment of a general superintend
ent for the Institute, and he also paid
public thanks to C. W. ML Smith ft>r a
complete set of the British Patent Re
ports. m
ROBBED A TILL
IN A SALOON
John Donovan Threatens to
Brain the Bartender and
Chases Him Out.
Ho Has Been Arrested on Sever a l
Occasions, but Manages to "Heat"
the Cases.
John Donovan, a man of 26. has a pe
culiar faculty of getting himself arrested
! on various charges and always having
! the sood fortune to "beat" the cases by
' some of the methods so well known to the
! Police Judges. Yesterday morning he was
again arresied, and as the charge against
him is robbery, it will be interesting to
I watch whether his usual good fortune
'â  will stick to him on the present occasion.
About 7 o'clock he entered the grocery
and saloon of M. B. Caranaugfli, corner
of Bryant and Zoe streets, in an intoxi
cated condition. He asked the bartender,
James McCaffery, for a glass of whisky.
McCaffery poured out a glass, and Dono
f van goi 'angry because it was not full
j enough. He threw the whisky at Md'uf
fery and. seizing two bottles that were
j on the counter threatened to brain jic
| Caffery with them, and chased him out
'â ' of the" saloon. McCaffery watched him
through the door, and saw him open me
till and take out $2. all the money that
was in it.
When Cavanauprh came to the saloon
! about an hour later, McCaffery told him
! of what had occurred, and Cavanaugh
, hurried to the Southern police station
: and reported the robbery. Policemen W .
H Harrison and H. Heinz were detailed
! on the case, and they found Donovan in
I bed in his house at 16 Zoe street. They
made him get out of bed with their as
i sistance.ard after he.ping him to put on
' his clothes they took him to the City
Prison, where a charge of robbery was
i booked against him.
Donovan is well connected, but has been
! a source of trouble for years to his rela-
I tives and friends, who have always sue
' ceeded in getting him out of his scrapes.
Laboring Men Organize.
There was a large meeting held at
Washington Hall, corner of Washington
and Mason streets, Saturday evening,
composed of laboring men from all parts
of the city. A temporary organization
was effected by 250 men signing the roll
and electing the following officers: Chair
man, Thomas Egan; secretary, M. T.
Himes; treasurer. Tim Crane; executive
committee, John Kearney, George Welsh.
O 11. Lynch, P. Hemmingway and P.
Clark. The following resolution was pre
sented and carried amid great enthusiasm:
Resolved, That the secretary be instructed
to send a communication to the chairman of
the Board of Freeholders, now drafting a new
charter, protesting against the clause requir
ing all public work authorized by the Board
of Supervisors to be done by written contract
and demanding that all public work shall be
done by the Board of Public Works by day
labor.
The members of the club propose to ef
fect an organization of all the laboring
men in the city and county, to the end
that they may do away with the present
contract" system, and to elevate the con
dition of labor and laboring men.

SORRY HE
DID NOT
KILL THEM
Jerry Sullivan's Mur
derous Assault on
the Keatings.
He Thought the Woman
Too "Fresh," so He
Shot Her.
She Was Known to the Police
as the Queen of the
Pickpockets.
SULLIVAN WAS CRAZED.
Ho Accused Jim Keating of Being a
"Stool Pigeon" and a
Spy.
Smarting under an imaginary wrong
Jerry Sullivan, a City Hall janitor,
last evening shot and seriously wound
ed Mabel Keating, the "queen of pick
pockets," and her husband, James
Keating.
The shooting occurred in the latter"?
saloon at Morton street and Grant
avenue. According to the statement
of Keating' the murderous lanitor en-
The Would- Be Slayer and the Two Victims of His Revolver.
tered his saloon, and accused him of
being a "stool pigeon." Keating de
nied the impeachment, and ordered
Sullivan to leave the saloon.
"You ow e me a few dollars," re
marked Keatin" "but as you can't pay
it, I am willing to call it square."
"You're not the only policeman on
the beat," sarcastically remarked Sul
livan, "a trick can be turned, and you
would not be on to it."
Keating vigorously denied that he
was in cahoots with the police, and de
fied Sullivan to prove that he was a
"stool pigeon." At this juncture
Keating's wife, who was in a rear
room, appeared, and advised her hus
band not to have any trouble with Sul
livan.
"Why don't you make him pay you
what he owes . she remarked. "He is
no good anyway."
Just then Sullivan, who it is said
â¢was crazed from the effects of an over
induiKcnce in opium mingled with Bar
bary Coast whisky, suddenly drew a
revolver, and pointing the weapon at
the ur.suspeetins* woman, fired.
The bullet struck her in the right
breast, ranged upward and lodged in
the armpit.
Immediately after being shot Mrs.
Keating ran from the saloon and fell
on the sidewalk. With an oath, Sulli
van, who calmly watched her as she
ran from the saloon, turned the still
smi iking revolver on Keating and
pulled thf> trigger.
The bullet struck the saloonkeeper in
the back of the neck, and emerged from
a point behind the left ear. As he fell,
presumably mortally wounded. Sulli
van put the revolver Sn his pocket, and
. at once left the place.
The report of the pistol shots at
tracted the attention of Detective Ed
Gibson and Ross Whittaker, who wire
dining in a restaurant on the opposite
side of the street, and they immediately
proceeded to make an investigation. As
they emerged from the restaurant they
saw Sullivan running along Grant ave
nue, pursued by Policemen Fennell, Joy
and Douglass. The murderous janitor
turned up Stockton place, and, heed
less of the officers' repeated calls, he
continued running.
At Stockton street he was overtaken
by Policeman Fennell, who, after a
Â£bort struggle, succeeded in handcuf
fing him. He was then taken to the
City Prison, and was locked up pend
ing the result of his victims' injuries.
In the meantime. Detective Gibson
had summoned the patrol wagon, and
Keating and his wife were removed to
the Receiving Hospital.
Dr. James Tormey, who was in
charge, made an examination of their
wounds, and pronounced them both se
riously injured. On account of the ema
ciated condition of Mrs. Keating, due
to the excessive use of opium, he did
not attempt to extract the bullet. Sul
livan was subsequently booked on two
charges of assault to commit murder.
The wounded woman is known to the
polire as the "queen of pickpockets."
Although frequently arrested for grand
larceny, she has managed to escape
conviction. For years she has been a
creaturp of the "tenderloin," robbing
bucolic strangers, and apparently en
jiiving immunity from arrest. As she
lay on a cot in the Receiving Hospi
tal last night she begged the woman
attendant to bring her some opium.
â¢'I am a confirmed fiend," she admit
ted, as tears strolled down her cheeks:
"do not let me die in pain."
In answer to the questions of the
detectives, the unfortunate woman said
that Sullivan, who she says is also a
"dope" fiend, visited the saloon, and
asked for her husband. She was sitting
in a back room at the time.
"Thinking he meant to injure my
husband," she remarked, "I walked
out of the room and advised Sullivan
to go home. As I stepped between
them Sullivan drew his revolver and
shot me. I ran from the saloon, and
as I fell, on tho sidewalk I heard an
other pistol shot and at once realized
that he had shot my husband.
"Jim has been very kind to Sullivan,
and why lie should try to kill both of
us seems strange to say the least. I
suppose he was crazed from the effects
of opium, and wanted to be a bad man.
He had no right to shoot me, and I j
merely told Jim not to have anything \
to do with him."
Keating was at a loss to account for
the shooting except to say that he
thought Sullivan was crazy from the
effects ofÂ«"too much dope."
"When he entered the saloon," said
Keating, "he appeared friendly and sa
luted me in the usual way. After
drinking a glass of whisky he turned
t.> me and accused me of trying to do
him up. I asked him what he meant,
when he suddenly became angry and
said, 'I owe you a few dollars, but I
want you to understand that I am all
right.' He then declared that I was a
'stool pigeon' and stood in with the
police. I laughed at the accusation,
and just then my wife appeared. As
she stepped between us he .at once
drew a revolver and fired at her.
"Being unarmed I started to leave the
saloon when he turned the weapon on
me and fired. Why Sullivan should
attempt to murder us is very strange.
We have . always been friendly and !
when he was broke I frequently gave ;
him money. My only explanation of
the attempted double tragedy is that he
was. crazed from the affects of opium,
and did not know what he was doing."
After being taken to the City Prison
Sullivan refused to make a statement.
"I'm on to my job," was his surly
remark. "You want to get next to
yourself. I admit I shot the guys, and
I'm sorry I didn't kill them. I'm red
hot mad, and I want you to understand
it. Mabel had no right to interfere,
and for being too fresh she got the
worst of it."
More than this Sullivan refused to
; say. According: to the police Sullivan
! is a confirmed opium fiend and an asso
ciate of disreputable characters. When
he entered the saloon he was accom
panied by his brother "Jack," who Im
mediately after the shooting disap
peared. Despite the efforts of the de
tectives he could not be found last
night.
Several months ago Sullivan had a
row with his sister-in-law In a disrep
utable house on Grant avenue. At that
time, it is claimed, he was stupid from
the effects of opium and liquor, and
when she refused to accede to his re
quest for money he drew a revolver
and took a shot at her. The bullet
passed through her hat, slightly injur
ing her scalp. She at first threatened
to have him arrested, but as he prom
ised to behave himself she finally re
lented.
He Robbed the Cash Drawer.
Dr. Robert Riley was victimized about
3:30 o'clock on Saturday afternoon by a
well-dressed young man, who entered his
drupr store, corner of Second and Howard
streets, and asked for a twelve-ounce bot
tle of carbolic acid. The doctor put up the
desire^ amount in a bottle, and his cus
tomer then changed his mind and said he
wanted twice that amount of the acid.
This necessitated the doctor's going into
a rear room to get a larger bottle, and
while he was gone the young man re
lieved the cash drawer of $15 in coin.
When the druggist returned he had left.
He is described as being about five and a

THE LATEST PICTURES OF PETER JACKSON.
S~\ NCE a priest always a priest,"
I "Once a Mason always a Mason,"

Peter Jackson, the dusky gladi

Irish patriotism was aroused to the
highest pitch yesterday afternoon, by
an oration delivered by ex-Judge Rob
ert Ferral before the St. Patrick's day
convention of 1898.
The convention met at K. R. B. Hall,
on Mason street, to complete the pre
liminaries for thÂ» celebration on the
17th. and after the routine work had
been finished President Frank Conklin
introduced Judge Ferral, who delivered
a most stirring address. The speaker
referred to the recent celebration in
this city of Robert Emmets birthday,
and said in part:
"That was hut a forerunner of the
celebration we will hold on fct. Pat
that Peter Jackson still possesses that
physical grace and symmetrical beauty
which he displayed eight years ago.
His muscles are supple and firm, and
but few indications of fat mar an
otherwise perfect condition. He weighs
195 pounds at present, the same weight
as when he entered the ring with Cor
bett in 1891. If there are any marks
of dissipation remaining, they are to
be found on his face. As far as his
body is concerned, he is still the same
bronze statue. How far the vitality
of the man has been sapped can only be
judged when he is viewed in the heat
of actual battle. Dr. Paran, after a
careful and complete examination, pro
nounces the old-time favorite to be in
the best of physical health and con
dition. "Oh, I have taken off a stone
and a half since I began training," said
Peter yesterday, "and I feel as a man
in perfect health. The training came
hard at first, but it's all right now."
Peter says little, but he Is working
hard.
rick's day. I think, every delegate to
this convention was present on that oc
casion and you all remember the trib
utes paid to Emmet then. But there
are a few things I would like to say
about him and the other patriots who
have given their lives to Ireland that
will not seem out of place now.
"The very time of Emmet's birthâ the
year 1778â was most fitting. He came
into the world when Grattan's patri
otic words thrilled the old world, when
Washington's patriotic deeds thrilled
the new. With his first breath EQminet
breathed the very air of patriotism."
Judge Ferral reviewed the life of Em
met. Wolfe Tone and the others whose
names have become famoub in Irish
history, and said that those men did
not die for their country, for patriots
never die. "Though they languished
in prison, fell fighting for their beloved
country or swung from a scaffold by
the oppressors of their land, their deeds
shall live forever in the hearts cf their
peopk ."
"Americans can well sympathize with
those men who have fallen victims of
British hatred and British brutality,"
he continued, "for one of the bright
est men in the struggle for freedom
from the British yoke was hanged
without trial and without even
a hearing; the last letter he
wrote to his mother was torn to
shreds before his eyes and the frag
ments cast at his feet. What American
can read the history of Nathan Hale
and then say he wants an arbitration
treaty with Oreat Britain? Such men
as Nathan Hale and Robert Emmet
have not lived in vain."
Judge Ferial compared the treatment
accorded Major Andre with that Na
than Hale had received at the hands of
his captors. Andre's offense was even
worse than Hales. for he had been ne
gotiating with a traitor â Benedict Ar
nold â when he was captured, whereas
Hale was a spy; yet Andre was shown
every courtesy and given a fair trial,
Lafayette himself sitting as the hea;l
of the court that condemned him tc
death Andre pleaded to be permitted
to die like a soldier, and not be hanged
like a dog; but the people said: "Let
him die as Nathan Hale died."
"Years afterward, when the Western
republic stood forth among the nations
of the world, England removed Major
Andre's remains from American soil,
and gave them honored burial in West
minster Abbey, erecting a costly monu
ment to his memory. If such a man
is honored with a monument, in God's
name, why should not Wolfe Tone be
honored with a monument?

Irish ancestry, and since boyhood I
have participated in the celebration on
the 17th day of March, for I believe
I that such a man who could make such
a grand bloodless religious conquest of
a people should be honored by every
! body without regard to creed or sect.
Moreover, I look upon this day as a
natal day for Ireland."
Jeremiah Deasy then sang an old Irish
love song in Celtic, accompanied on the
zither by Miss Frances Borr, and for
an encore sang the same song in Eng
lish.
General P. F. Walsh was called upon
for an address, and paid a tribute to
the heroes of '98. He was followed by
Michael O'Mahoney, who read a poem
in Celtic, on the return of young
Hugh O'Donnell to Dublin Castle in
1592, prefacing the reading with a call
to his countrymen to perpetuate their
mother tongue by teaching their chil
dren to speak it.
This closed the proceedings of the
convention proper, but a meeting of the
executive committee was held immedi
ately afterward, at which the reports
of the various sub-committees having
in charge the St. Patrick's day cele
bration were received.
The programmes for the afternoon
and evening entertainments at Wood
ward's Pavilion were reported as being
about completed. The stereopticon
virws of Irish and American scenes
in the afternoon for the ladies and
children promise to be exceedingly in
structive and entertaining. All the
local theaters have promised to con
tribute talent for the entertainments.
